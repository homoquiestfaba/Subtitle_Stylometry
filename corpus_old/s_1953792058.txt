>> You got food?

Filming. My name is Chris, and I
grew up just outside of New York City.

This is Zach, and he's a close friend of
mine from Seattle. We've grown up with very

similar lives. These are the
houses we were born in...

Our families... the awkward
middle-school phase...

The sports we played... and these
are the things we did for fun...

I met Zach during my first year at college,
and we quickly became close friends.

Our lives are fast-paced, and these are the
things that we're used to seeing every day.

[ Atm whirring ] [ Horns
honking ] [ Atm beeping ]

This is chino. He is 12 years old and
lives in a rural village in Guatemala.

He lives in extreme poverty, on less than one dollar a day.
How can we begin to understand

what his life is like, about what it means to
live every day with no clean water, little

food, and poor shelter? And just like chino,
there are over 1.1 billion people around

the world that survive on one dollar a day.
Zach and I study international

development in school, but there are some
things that a textbook just can't answer.

So we're creating a plan to spend our summer
living on only one dollar a day in a rural

Guatemalan village -- in
chino's village.

Okay. Bye, mom. I love you.
Muah!

I mean, I think it's just an amazing opportunity
to learn for myself what it really means

to live under a dollar a day... which, coming
from this reality, I can't really say I have any

idea.

I love you. >> I love you, too.
>> I'll see you.

We're bringing along two filmmakers...
And setting out to better

understand the reality of extreme
poverty firsthand. Let's do this.

[ High-pitched voice ] Hello!

[ Whooshing ] [ Mid-tempo music plays
] We're beginning our journey in

Guatemala city with a six-hour ride
on the back of a crowded chicken bus.

We are headed to the village of peÃ±a blanca
that's representative of rural poverty

in many parts of the world. In these remote
areas of Guatemala, 7 out of 10 people

live under the poverty line.

[ Breathing heavily ]

Is that -- are you hitting stuff there?
>> Well, I think we've got a

boundary of, like, a big rock right here,
so this might have to be our edge.

Sweet. >> Maybe it can
be chipped away. >> Yeah.

It can.

Okay. >> Why is it
going out like that?

You're pulling it too hard.
>> Pulling it too hard? No.

[ Chuckling ] Sadness. >> Right.
We're getting everything...

Eight weeks of this is going to be
pretty intense I'm not going to lie.

[ Both laugh ] >> Oh, God.

I cannot believe it came together
this is so one of those ideas

that we'd talk about and never do.
Well we're here...

Audio recording. >> Filming, filming.
>> [ Chuckles ]

[ Sighs ] >> [
Chuckles ] >> Well...

[ All chuckle ] >> We're here in the
rural highlands, in the small village

of peÃ±a blanca. There are about 300
people living here, most of whom are

Mayan. >> Most of the people only
spoke a Mayan dialect called

Kaqchikel, and it was impossible to learn.
[ Both speaking Kaqchikel ]

We want to live as close as possible to the
reality of poverty, so we're replicating a

few key aspects of it. Our budget for the
trip is one dollar a day each, for 56

days. But instead of giving ourselves
one dollar every day, we're

making our income unpredictable.
This way, we do not know when

we'll get paid. We're doing this because
many of our neighbors are employed

informally as day laborers or farmers, so
they never know when they'll get paid or how

much they'll make. We're simulating this
by taking our total budget of one dollar

a day each and splitting it into
random numbers between zero and nine.

Then, every morning, we'll pick a number out of a hat.
If we pick a nine, we make

nine dollars that day. >> Pulled a nine.
>> No way!

You got a nine? >> Or it's a six.
>> That's a nine, for sure.

It's great, ain't it? >> Well-picked.
>> Dude. He's good.

A second aspect of poverty we want to simulate
is the process of starting our own business.

So we're taking out a loan of $125 to pay for
somewhere to live and for a plot of land to

grow radishes on. Our small loan is
part of a service for the poor called

microfinance. Zach and I have heard
both good and bad things about these

banks but wanted to see firsthand if they
were helping in peÃ±a blanca, both from our

neighbors and by taking out a loan ourselves.
This means that, every 15 days,

we'll have to pay back small installments of
$6.25, or else have to default on our loan.

[ Camera shutter clicking ]

What would you say? >> I mean,
we've got 1,312 quetzales.

That's pretty decent. >> That's
how much we have left, yeah.

So... >> Get a chick
and sell some eggs.

Yeah, I mean, out of that, we could get -- I
mean, if we buy a chicken out of that, that's...

Dude, we're not buying a chicken out of that.
>> I think we should buy a

chicken out of that. >> No, dude.
Like, chickens don't, like,

automatically lay eggs. >> [ Chuckles
] >> We don't have money for feed.

And we can buy, like, fruit or anything
else that's so much better for us.

Okay, we'll research, dude. We'll
research the chicken-egg complex.

I will be so angry if our chicken doesn't lay eggs.
>> [ Speaking Spanish ]

[ Chuckles ]

Hola. >> Is that really where
we're gonna [Chuckling] get water

from?

Oh, dude, there's a bug in there.
>> Sean, you should check this

out. That's actually how
much stuff is in there.

Hey, we have a water source.
>> [ Chuckles ]

That was the whole point. >> Then we can't
grow anything that's gonna finish by the time

we leave. >> But if we can actually
grow radishes, essentially, in time,

does that sort of switch our idea back?
>> Well, except for that I still

don't know how to really grow radishes.
>> [ Chuckles ]

Yeah. >> Like, anything depends on
the soil content, which we have no

idea about. Like, it depends on
how much fertilizer we need.

You just need to know how to farm, and we just don't.
I mean, we could wing it and try

and hope that it works.
>> Yeah. >> <i>Â¿diez?</i>

<i>>> Ah. Diez. >> SÃ­. >> Ah.</i>

<i>>> Â¿Es muy caro? >> Muy caro.
>> Yeah.</i>

<i>QuÃ© mala. >> Â¿como asÃ­?
>> SÃ­. Como asÃ­.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> Gracias</i>don Carlos.
>> [ Speaking Spanish ]

[ Chuckles ] >> <i>SÃ­.
MuchÃ­simas gracias. Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>>> [ Chuckles ] >> Oh, no. Oh!</i>

<i>>> Oh! [ Speaks indistinctly
] Holy cow! Oh, man!</i>

<i>>> Six. >> Hey. Gracias.
>> De nada.</i>

<i>[ Both chuckle ]</i>
<i>>> [ Speaking indistinctly ]</i>

<i>>> One of my questions was, were the people
living in extreme poverty, like, really thinking</i>

<i>about how they manage money, or was it this
survival mode, and it's like just trying to scrape</i>

<i>together anything they have just to
feed their children? [ Horn honks ]</i>

<i>[ Horn honks ]</i>

<i>[ Both speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>[ Cash register dings ] [ Cash register
dings ] [ Cash register dings ]</i>

<i>[ Cash register dings ] [ Chicks
chirping ] We can't buy that.</i>

<i>Firewood is probably the most expensive
thing that we were buying in our budget.</i>

<i>But we are living on the line, on the edge,
always, of being able to drop into a really bad</i>

<i>situation. [ Cash register dings
] >> A little bit bumpy, too.</i>

<i>>> Whoa! Ooh. >> [
Chuckles ] >> Ooh.</i>

<i>>> [ Sighs ] >> All right.</i>

<i>>> [ Blows ]</i>

<i>[ Slurps ] Ahh! >> This
is the best thing I've</i>

<i>ever eaten. [ Chuckles ] [
Pencil scratching paper ]</i>

<i>1 pounds of black beans gives us 1,600 calories.
1 pounds of yellow rice gives</i>

<i>us 2,000, roughly. But, still, like, 3,600
calories split amongst four people is not</i>

<i>good enough for our daily</i>
<i>value.</i>

<i>>> [ Chuckling ] Yeah. >> Zach
fell flat on his ass after.</i>

<i>Every time we stand up, for some
reason, like, get huge head rushes.</i>

<i>I've almost passed out, like -- I don't
know -- today probably like three times.</i>

<i>And I don't know if that's a lack of nutrition
or what the deal is, but Zach actually went</i>

<i>for it today. We had our first full-on
fall, and when he came to, he was only</i>

<i>speaking in Spanish. [ Thunder rumbling
] >> I'm used to eating a lot.</i>

<i>I'm used to being active a lot. But when you're
not eating anything -- when you're eating</i>

<i>like 500 calories, you become incredibly lethargic.
You have zero energy to do</i>

<i>anything.</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking native language ]</i>

<i>[ Girl giggling ]</i>

<i>[ Machete chopping ]</i>

<i>>> This is only my second week actually in peÃ±a
blanca, and I feel like we're already showing</i>

<i>signs of being worn down and dejected.
We all have these pulgas.</i>

<i>We all kind of got destroyed on our dirt floors.
[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>[ Camera shutter clicking ]</i>

<i>>> And, you know, that was [Chuckles] that was
the point where I was like, "I want to go</i>"

<i>home. Like, I need
to get out of here.</i>

<i>"Why am I doing this?" And we were eating
better than a lot of the people in the</i>

<i>community.</i>

<i>>> Jose enrico just brought us a gift.
He wrote us a letter.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ] Â¿sÃ­?
>> Aw, gracias,</i> Jose.

SÃ­.

[ Speaking Spanish ]

[ Speaking Spanish ]

[ Indistinct shouting ] >> Oh.
[ Indistinct shouting ]

[ Speaking Spanish ]

[ Speaking Spanish ] [
Children giggling ] Oh.

Yay! >> Okay. [
Speaking Spanish ]

[ Speaking Spanish ] >> <i>SÃ­.
[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>[ Chuckles ] [ Indistinct
talking in Spanish ]</i>

<i>[ School bell rings ] [ Children shouting
excitedly ] That was absolutely nuts.</i>

<i>Did you see that madness? That was 315 kids
playing with like 6 different balls at the</i>

<i>same time. And I don't know.
What's up, Carlos?</i>

<i>And I don't how many games and, like,
snacks were distributed, but that was nuts.</i>

<i>That was nuts. How fun. Yeah. How fun.
[ Both speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> We really didn't know who he was, initially,
that he was kind of just the kid that was</i>

<i>always around. And he was just,
like, so eager to learn.</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] How...
>> Are you?</i>

<i>>> Pssh! Hi. It turns
out chino's family</i>

<i>couldn't afford the $25 cost of books and supplies
for school. >> They had a family of eight</i>

<i>that lived in a single room. They no longer had
electricity, because they couldn't pay for</i>

<i>it. You know, his father never knew
when he was gonna work or not,</i>

<i>'cause he worked as a day laborer.
And chino, who is 12, had to</i>

<i>work in the fields.</i>

<i>We'd see him coming, walking up the Mountain
with this thing wrapped around his head and,</i>

<i>like, a huge bundle of, like, logs and
sticks behind him. At one point, Chris asked</i>

<i>chino, like, you know, "if you could
do anything, what would you be?"</i>

<i>And chino's response was, you know, "I'm gonna
be a farmer." And Chris was like, "no, like,</i>

<i>what would you be if you could be
anything? " And, I mean, he was like, " I'd</i>

<i>be a pro soccer player." But at 12 years
old, chino had accepted the fate that he was</i>

<i>gonna be a farmer.</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking native language ]</i>

<i>>> Chino, like most of the people here,
speaks Kaqchikel and only a few words of</i>

<i>Spanish. >> [ Speaking Spanish
] >> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>[ Speaking indistinctly ] >> Aguacate.
>> Aguacate.</i>

<i>Â¿O? >> En inglÃ©s, e</i>avocado.
>> Avoca-- avocado.

<i>SÃ­. >> Avocado.
>> Both: Avocado.</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> Food. >> [ Speaking
Spanish ] Ik?</i>

<i>>> Ik. >> Both: Ik. Ik. [
Both speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> Both: Candle. >> Candle.
>> A candÃ©l.</i>

<i>>> CandÃ©l. >> Yeah, I mean, I think
I completely saw myself in a lot</i>

<i>of them. You know, I was, like, eager
to learn, where you're, like, so</i>

<i>excited about building little things outside
of our house, and, you know, that's</i>

<i>what I did for my childhood, and realizing
that it is the situation that they're in</i>

<i>that's holding them back, not</i>
<i>who they are.</i>

<i>>> Hey. Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s? >> How...
>> How are you?</i>

<i>>> How are you? >> How are you?
>> "How... are... you?"</i>

<i>[ Rooster crows ] The rÃ¡ban</i>are growing.
>> I know.

I'm gonna pay off on my finance loan.
>> [ Sniffs ]

I'm gonna eat more. >> [ Chuckles
] >> It's gonna happen, man.

I can sense it already. >> [
Chuckles ] >> Very clumpy, though.

They are really clumpy.
That's bad, right?

Everything about a banana just brings me joy here.
You peel it back. It's naked.

It's a naked fruit. >> [ Speaks indistinctly
] >> I just take a bite and savor

it each time like it's the best bite of
banana I will ever take, every single time.

I just make sure, like, the top
of the banana is always even after.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, your teeth
marks kind of indent it like this.

Yeah. >> So then you got to play
the game and, like, reverse the

bite. >> Oh, nice. Yeah. Move it up.
>> So that it's even, you know?

And it slows down your eating,
too.

As economics majors, Chris and I were really
interested in, how did a person living under a

dollar a day manage their money?
>> So we were asking people

questions like, "how much money do you make?
What are your expenses?"

Where do you save money? Do you
have any outstanding loans?"

You know, these are really personal questions
for anyone. >> <i>Hola. Buenas tardes.</i>

<i>>> Hola. Buenas.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> Anthony, in, I
think, the first week we were there, he</i>

<i>was, like, the first grown-up from the community
to come to our house, introduce himself.</i>

<i>You know, he was so excited to</i>
<i>meet us.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> [ Chuckles ] [
Grunts ] [ Chuckles ]</i>

<i>Ah. See? >> Just 24 and 20 years
old, Anthony and rosa already manage</i>

<i>a household of eight people. >> Mm.
>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>[ Baby coos ] >> [
Chuckles ] >> Oh.</i>

<i>>> No? [ Baby crying
] >> [ Chuckles ]</i>

<i>As a family, they survive on $1.25 each per day
to pay for not only food, but larger costs</i>

<i>of a new baby, their kids' education,
and repairs to their house.</i>

<i>>> Like, his wife is 20. I'm 20.
And she has three children.</i>

<i>>> His wife's younger than me, dude.
>> He's 24.</i>

<i>>> I look up to her so much. [ Both speaking
Spanish ] They're teaching us how to more</i>

<i>efficiently make fires... cook more substantive food...
And better bargain in town.</i>

<i>Living so close to the edge, these small changes
are having huge impacts on our lives.</i>

<i>Probably the most important one is lard.
We bought some straight lard</i>

<i>today in town to try to add to our fat content.
If you could feel this texture</i>

<i>right now, it is one of the
foulest things ever. [ Sizzling ]</i>

<i>This lard right here has -- what was it -- 208
grams of fat and 1,080 calories, which is the</i>

<i>equivalent of more than the rice or beans that
we were eating. >> And we started mashing our</i>

<i>beans and refrying our beans in lard.
It's so good in the stomach.</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] In our third week,
they invited us over to their home for a</i>

<i>small snack. But when we arrived, they
were preparing the traditional meal</i>

<i>of pulick, served only twice a</i>
<i>year for special occasions.</i>

<i>[ Both chuckle ] >> Oh!
Oh! >> Â¿sÃ­?</i>

<i>>> SÃ­. >> Claro. >> Claro.</i>

<i>>> Mmm. >> Sean, you can sit down.
>> Yeah.</i>

<i>>> He wants to say a few things
to the camera. >> Oh. SÃ­.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> MuchÃ­simas gracias a mi hermano.
>> Yes.</i>

<i>[ Chuckles ] >> Our desire to repay
Anthony and rosa, not only for the</i>

<i>expense of the incredible food but also
their generosity, is overwhelming.</i>

<i>They have so little, yet they're willing to give so much.
We all agreed that, somehow, we</i>

<i>will save the money to cook them
a pulick dinner before we go.</i>

<i>>> We have like 60.</i>
<i>It's only three days.</i>

<i>We can just decrease our amount. We can
get like, you know, a pound and a half.</i>

<i>I mean, I don't think we even really need
to dip into our savings that much...</i>

<i>>> Yeah. >> ...At all. >>
That would be awesome.</i>

<i>>> If we just want to, like, not eat very much.
>> [ Shivers, sniffles ]</i>

<i>[ Rooster crows ]</i>

<i>>> I drew a low number today, so we're having some...
Struggles with how we need to</i>

<i>pay Anthony's family back and also pay off
our loan, which is due in three days.</i>

<i>So...</i>

<i>>> We drew really low numbers for four days.
I pulled four numbers in a row,</i>

<i>and two of them were zeros, and two of them were ones.
So amongst the four of us, we</i>

<i>had 12 cents a person to live on, per day.
And, you know, we woke up, and</i>

<i>it was market day, and we
literally have no money for food.</i>

<i>>> Open the other one now.</i>
<i>[ Hinges squeak ]</i>

<i>So this is a big pull we need
a minimum a two or higher</i>

<i>if we get a one no
bananas if we get a zero</i>

<i>we have to go talk to Anthony
and take out a loan from him.</i>

<i>>> Let's see it. >> It's a nine.
>> No way!</i>

<i>>> No! >> [ Chuckles ] >> Yeah!</i>

<i>>> Seany boy! >> Dude, you're the
clutchest puller in the world!</i>

<i>>> [ Giggles ] >> It's a mosh pit!
>> Whoo!</i>

<i>>> Yes! >> Oh, my God!
>> Dude, so huge.</i>

<i>>> Bananas for everyone! >> [ Chuckles
] >> We got lucky and pulled a</i>

<i>nine. But what if you're out of
food and you don't know the next</i>

<i>time money will be coming in? How do you
choose between feeding your child or keeping</i>

<i>them in school?</i>
<i>[ Water splashing ]</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> Both: SÃ­.</i>

<i>>> Both: SÃ­.</i>

<i>>> It's... >> Day 28. Right?
Day 28? >> Day 28. Yeah.</i>

<i>>> We had started to do these really
amazing interviews around the fourth week.</i>

<i>And Chris and I spoke Spanish, so we were
understanding everything that was going on,</i>

<i>and, you know, we had started to be affected
by these stories, but Ryan and Sean</i>

<i>didn't speak Spanish. And they were talking,
and they were like, "when you finally</i>"

<i>deal with learning how to survive, it's not
so bad." >> No problem -- it's not that</i>

<i>hard, you know? We're halfway through.
I could do this for another, you</i>

<i>know, two years. >> I just got really
angry and upset because, clearly, the</i>

<i>people we're around, you know, they had
learned to survive. But it wasn't okay.</i>

<i>And it wasn't easy for them, and they had to,
like, work so hard every single day, and they</i>

<i>couldn't follow their dreams, because they
couldn't go to school, and 'cause they had to</i>

<i>provide for their family. And Chris and I
were so involved with this research that we</i>

<i>weren't sharing what was going on.
>> What were some of the</i>

<i>questions in general? I mean, I guess I
don't really even know what you guys were</i>

<i>asking. >> We started getting into
where all their income was coming</i>

<i>from and, you know, like, what skills they use
to work and what they really deal with to find</i>

<i>money in emergencies, and, you know [Chuckles]
their lives are so much more complicated than</i>

<i>our initial interviews showed. >> Even something
as simple as what you cook with is important.</i>

<i>A broken stove or cooking over an open fire
can have dramatic effects on the health of a</i>

<i>family, especially on the kids.</i>
<i>[ Baby crying ]</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>It's incredibly hard to save up a large amount
of money for a cooking stove, but Anthony</i>

<i>did it with 12 of his friends by using an
innovative idea called a savings club.</i>

<i>Together, they each decided to save $12 every month.
And at the end of each month,</i>

<i>the total sum of $144 would be randomly
distributed to one of the members.</i>

<i>This process then repeats itself until each
person has benefited from a large sum of</i>

<i>money at a single time. >> And that large
sum of money was much more useful to them</i>

<i>because they could take that money and spend
it on a big-ticket item like a stove or</i>

<i>maybe pay for a wedding. And, you
know, that's really innovative.</i>

<i>[ Camera shutter clicks ] And we started talking
about how close this community was, and we</i>

<i>hang out with chino every day. And his mom, this
past year, got really sick, and they don't even</i>

<i>have enough money to, you know, get a car to go
to the hospital in town, and Anthony covered the</i>

<i>entire thing.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ] >> And Anthony actually
paid for them to go to the hospital.</i>

<i>He paid for the doctor's visits. >> And
the medicine. >> And the medicine.</i>

<i>>> Anthony can afford the loan because he's
the only one in the village who has a formal</i>

<i>job.</i>

<i>Unlike everyone else, he can count
on getting a regular paycheck.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> And while Anthony did help these other people,
like, that's still a huge strain on their own</i>

<i>finances. Yeah, that's where, like,
if there was an institution willing</i>

<i>to take on that risk and lend to someone like
chino's parents, you know, then they don't have</i>

<i>to put a strain on Antonio. >> And, you know,
not everyone has that community around them</i>

<i>or the people they can go to
in times of need. >> Hola.</i>

<i>>> And, you know, and that was
something that -- >> hola.</i>

<i>>> Hola. >> Hola</i>chino. >> Chris.

[ Chuckles ] What's up, chino?
>> Zach, <i>hola. Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s?</i>

<i>>> Bien. Bien. >> How are you?
>> [ Chuckles ]</i>

<i>QuÃ© bueno. Good. I am good.
>> You look nice.</i>

<i>>> How are you? >> How are you?
>> Good.</i>

<i>>> SÃ­. Bueno. So, yeah, not everyone
has, you know, such a tight-knit</i>

<i>community around them. >> So, if you have an
emergency like chino's parents here, like,</i>

<i>what are you gonna do if you don't have that
person right next to you or you don't have</i>

<i>the emergency funds or that community
to rely on? >> That's true.</i>

<i>>> Actually, temple is pretty sick at the moment.
He's got a little bit of an</i>

<i>upset tummy.</i>

<i>This is just going to make me vomit.
>> [ Chuckles ]</i>

<i>>> At one point, I had both giardia and E. Coli
at the same time, and, you know, that's no</i>

<i>good, especially when you only have two pairs
of boxers and you're sleeping, you know, on</i>

<i>the same mat, sharing a blanket with someone next to you.
>> I think Chris is really sick.</i>

<i>I just heard him get up. It just doesn't
sound like he's doing very well.</i>

<i>>> Dude, I think I have that like
sulfuric burp thing happening again.</i>

<i>[ Burps loudly ] [ Breathes deeply
] Like, I can't even push on my</i>

<i>stomach. [ Breathes deeply ] I
can't sleep another night like</i>

<i>this. >> We're gonna go get
Chris tested for some bacterial</i>

<i>infections and see if he has a parasite,
or, hopefully, it's just a stomach thing.</i>

<i>>> Today, in town, we found out that
Chris has some parasites in his stomach.</i>

<i>>> It's called giardia -- giardia, I believe.
And it's, like, lmng in my</i>

<i>small intestine in here. And it causes, like,
excessive bloating and stomach pressure.</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] >> Doscientos quetzales.
>> The medicine is 200</i>

<i>quetzales. So even if people could
afford to get tested, it's incredibly</i>

<i>expensive to actually get the medicine.
>> There's no way we could pay</i>

<i>that cost. I have to use medicine
that we brought in case of emergency.</i>

<i>[ Siren wailing ] If we can't budget for
a simple sickness, what will we do in</i>

<i>the case of a more serious problem?
Just two months before we</i>

<i>arrived, hurricane Agatha smashed through Guatemala.
>> Disaster workers in Guatemala</i>

<i>say at least a dozen people are dead.
>> [ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> [ Speaking Spanish ] >> [ Speaking
Spanish ] >> The tropical storm Agatha</i>

<i>slammed into its pacific coast</i>
<i>Saturday.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> If you've lost everything, how do you
get the money to get back on your feet?</i>

<i>How do you begin building a lump sum to start a business?
We wanted to see if getting a</i>

<i>loan from a traditional bank was
even an option for our neighbors.</i>

<i>>> Okay, so, you're gonna have to put the
camera down initially, I think, unless you</i>

<i>want me just, like, through the
door and then put it down. >> Yeah.</i>

<i>>> Buena, Buenas.</i>

<i>We can't take photos inside. So, um...
Are you, uh, going for the, uh,</i>

<i>discreet film? >> Yeah.
>> Yeah, sweet.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>>> Let's get out. Let's get out. Let's get out. Let's get out.
>> That was highly illegal to be</i>

<i>doing. So, I tried to see if we
could get a 3,000-quetzale loan.</i>

<i>And the problem is we need all of these other items.
We need a receipt of our</i>

<i>electricity bills. We need an N.I.T. Number,
which she said costs a bunch of money</i>

<i>to get. We need a copy of the amount
of money we're making, which I</i>

<i>don't think we can get if we have an informal job.
Bills from the last three</i>

<i>months, two people who will sign for us, and
then we need to be able to sign our name, too.</i>

<i>There's no chance we could get a loan
from that bank. There's just no way.</i>

<i>>> We visited rosa again to see
if there were any other options.</i>

<i>Grameen provides reliable savings accounts
and loans designed to empower the poorest</i>

<i>of the poor to improve their</i>
<i>lives.</i>

<i>[ Speaking Spanish ]</i>

<i>With a loan of just $200, rosa was able
to start her own weaving business.</i>

<i>>> It was so huge to see the potential for
what even the simple access to credit can do</i>

<i>in the lives of our neighbors, of
our close friends. >> Ah, sÃ­.</i> Oh.

[ Speaking Spanish ]
[ Light laughter ]

When a grameen borrower receives a loan,
they also commit to opening a long-term

savings account, a safe and a convenient
way to build up a large sum of money.

We found that beyond using a loan or savings
account to start a business, our neighbors
