What, you got another guy in here? Huh?

Yo, asshole, show your face!


Look at you.

What?
Well, you look like shit.

What's up with you?

Nothing.


What do you mean, nothing?
I know you. Something's up. What...


Where'd you go last night?
Nowhere, nothing. It's just...

So you came back home?
Yes, I was at home.

Okay, then why didn't you
answer my calls?

I just... I was just... I was...

Who were you with?
Stop it. Nothing.

Okay, so then why didn't you call me?
Nothing! Okay, I killed a man!

All right, well, if it's just that,

I know a great place upstate

I'm not joking.

Not a joke.

I don't know, just someone!

You're talking about the guy on TV,

singing with the kids
and the nursery rhymes and shit?

Huh?
Yes, I...

I killed him.

Okay. Okay, cut it out, all right?
You know...

What's the matter with you?
That's not funny.

I'm not... He was...

(STIFLING SOB) He was in the garage

and stuck to the car,
and I hit him and I...

I killed him.

You hit him?

Look at me.

You're not fucking around with me, right?

(MARY STIFLING SOBS)

(MARY GASPS)

That's some heavy shit, Mary.

I killed him.

All right, just... Just...

I killed him.
Okay, okay, all right.


Okay, okay.

I didn't see him and I killed him.
Okay, all right, all right.

Stop. Stop. Okay, okay.
I killed him!

I know, I know.
I killed him.

I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.
I know. Okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

MARY: I just...

I told him I was gonna help him,
and then he just...

He started attacking me, so I just...
I hit him with a golf club.

You hit him with a golf club?

Oh, my God. You're fucking nuts.

Don't yell at me.

I'm not yelling at you,
but I need to know what happened.

All right, Mary? You want to know why?

'Cause you're gonna need my help.

Trust me on that.

I just...

I just panicked.

He was just lying on the bumper like some

demented, dying animal,

and he was just screaming at me,
and he just...

He started to, like, attack me,
and he just wouldn't stop, and so,

I just grabbed the first thing I saw
and it was a golf club,

and I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

You have to believe me.
I did not mean it. I didn't mean it.

Mary, of course I believe you.

Okay? How long have we been going out?
Two years, right?

I believe every word
that comes out of your mouth, okay?

Okay?

All right, so, what,
this dude's still in the garage?

Mary, if I'm gonna help you,
you're gonna have to talk to me, okay?


You buried him?

No, please. You have to understand,
I was... I was so scared. I was so...

I know I probably should have
called the cops, but I didn't...

I didn't know what to do. Please, Rick.

Please, just help me, just help me.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Okay, I just need to think, all right?

We need a plan.

What kind of plan?
One that works.

Okay? One that we've gotta stick to,
and it's gotta be rock solid.

Okay, but what do we do?

Okay, okay.

No one, nowhere, no how,
can know about this, okay?

I know you want to vent right now,
but the most important thing you can do

(ENUNCIATING) is keep your mouth shut.
(WHISPERING) I don't think I can.

And then we move on one day at a time.

No mouthing off,
no loose ends, no haircuts,

nothing that brings attention to yourself,
Mary, and I mean nothing.

This will pass, okay? I promise.

This guy will get his 15 minutes of fame
and then bam, he ain't shit no more.

They'll find someone else to talk about.

That's the plan.

That's what they do.
At 3:30 in the morning?

Okay. These guys work
around the fucking clock, all right?

There's probably one
under my door right now.

Can't you come over?

And do what, huh?

What are we gonna do?
Sit around and worry?

Trust me,
it's only gonna make things worse.

Listen, Mary, all right?
I'm counting on you.

You need to calm yourself down.
All right, sweetie?

Yeah, I know, I know.

You're probably thinking,
"That's easy for you to say."

Fuck me, right? Yeah, but...

Look, I'm in this with you now, all right?
All the way.

So go take another downer, you know?

And if they're fives, take two,

wash it down with some booze
and get some sleep. All right?

Now, I need you to hold yourself together
for the next couple of days, all right?

And don't let this flyer thing
fuck with your mind, all right?
