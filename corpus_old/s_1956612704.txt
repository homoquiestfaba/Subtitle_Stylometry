Hi, I'm
Congressman Jose Maria Vega.

And with your help,

I am going to put Puerto Rico

back on the map again.

[Latin music plays]

If I am re-elected,

I will make sure

that our schools, our hospitals,

and our church organizations
that have been doing

such amazing work
for the community,

receive all the support
they deserve.

You can trust me on that.

We are going to rebuild
somehow, some way.

I think we did
a fantastic job in Puerto Rico.

Thanks
to the business incentives

I have already implemented,

I think we can all agree

the powerhouse
that is the Puerto Rican economy

is booming once again.

Is the crisis getting you down?

Are you feeling confused?
Worried?

Relax,
what you need is a new car.

No credit? No problem.

Bad credit? No problem.

Bankruptcy? No problem.

We have
certified bank officials on site

who will arrange a car loan
that's right for you instantly.

And this weekend,

it's my "Name Your Price"
extravaganza.

We have live music,

we have <i>pinchos,</i>

Brinca-brinca for the kids,

because as we say
in Morales Alto,

we can't solve the crisis,

but we can sell you a new car.

And that's my promise to you.

<i>Hello.</i>

<i>My name is Rafa.</i>

<i>Rafa Rodriguez.</i>

<i>And I'm offering you</i>

<i>the best used autos</i>

<i>in all of Puerto Rico.</i>

<i>If you can find a better price</i>

<i>on any of these models,</i>

<i>I will pay the difference,</i>

<i>and that is my offer to you.</i>

<i>Rafa Quality Cars!</i>

[Tape rewinds]

Hello, I'm--

[doorbell chimes]

Hello, my name is Rafa.

Rafa Rodriguez.

And I'm offering you
the best used cars

in all of Puerto Rico.

If you can f--

Hey! What's going on?

[Rafa bumps car]
Psst.

Let's go. Get out of the car.

Now.

Open the door
and get out of the car.

Get out of the--

Not through the window.

How did you get in there?
It was locked.

With a slim Jim.

[Truck horn honks]

Get out of here.

Give me back my Slim Jim.

I'm gonna give you back
your Slim Jim.

Go!

I'm gonna call the cops.

Ridiculous.

Hello, my name is Rafa.

Rafa Rodriguez,

and I'm bringing you

the best used autos

in all of Puerto Rico.

If you can find a better price--


to get out of here.

Why aren't you at school?

Shut, because of the crisis.

Still no power.

Anyway, what are you doing?

I am making a commercial.

Shouldn't you be a bit more...

Oh!

Like the guys on TV?

Show some hustle.

I was getting to the hustle.

You wanna do me a favor?

Go home.

Can't.

My mom got arrested.

That was her?

You only just moved in, right?
Mm-hmm.

You have any relatives
to stay with?

Neighbor?

Trying to run a business,
you can't stay here.

Oh, yeah, I have an aunt.

But I need a ride.

"Hello, my name is Rafa.

Rafa Rodriguez.

And that is my promise to you."

Yes, very funny.

Do you have a wife?

Got any kids?

Geez, just making polite talk.

[Charm tinkling]

I have two boys, all grown up.

How much further is this?


This is it?

Yeah.

[Rap music playing]

I have angina.


[reggaeton music playing]

[girl coughs]

Forgot which one.

Home sweet home.

Where's your aunt?

Probably moved to Florida,
you know?

Most people do if they can.

Okay, well, thanks for the ride.

Oh, no, no. You can't stay here.

Titi won't mind.

What's Titi's last name?

Rodriguez.

Rodriguez?


that's my name.

in Puerto Rico called Rodriguez.

[Rafa] Hello?
[Woman] <i>Directory assistance.</i>

I'd like the number
for Social Services.

No!
Yes. San Juan, yes, I'll hold.

You can't do that!

They'll put me
with foster parents.

And?

They take in kids
just to get the money.

And some of them
even interfere with them.

You know what that means?
The word "interfere"?

No, but if that happened to me,
that one would be on you.

Gotta get back to work.

[Salsa music
playing over stereo]

Did you have
a fight with your sons?

Is that why you don't see them?

They stay with their mom.

And we don't talk much.

I guess we're both on our own.

[Salsa music plays]

What's that island?

It's not an island.
It's Florida.

It's where I'm from.

You came from Florida
to Puerto Rico?

That's right.

Why?
Good question.

They were supposed to give me
one more month to pay.


No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!


You're supposed to give me
one more month!

The bank said installments!

Hey! Wait, wait, wait. Hey!

No!

Shit!

Shit!

Oh, shit!

steal all your cars?


We're done here.

Yeah, is tonight
a good night to see Jupiter?

[Reggaeton music
playing over stereo]

[reggaeton playing]

[rooster crowing]

[rap music in Spanish playing]



Ah!

Hmm.





Whoa!

Hey, Diego.

What the hell were you thinking?

Because even winners
lose sometimes.

Five thousand dollars.

It was a big bet, Rafa.

Never understand

why people bet so big
when they need money.

I don't need money.
Things are good.

So shall we say... two days?

Perfect.

I'll give you five.

It can be hard to get
a hold of cash right now.

Sounds good. I'm easy.

Just one thing.

Don't push it, Rafa.

We out of luck.

[Salsa music plays]

Oh.

Are you insane?

Ah!

Shit.

You bet $5,000!

Stop breaking into my car.

You seriously thought a rooster

would solve
all of your problems?

I need $10,000 to get
my cars back from the bank.

Without my cars,
I have no business.

Without my business,
I have no income.

Without income, I have no home.

Look. You've got four days,
23 hours, and 36 minutes

to pay that guy.

And we need a real plan,
you know?

Like, show some hustle.

What is it with this "we" thing?

There is no "we" here.


Come on, let's go, Joe.

[Engine starts]

to people who don't pay on time.


What's your name?

Ana.

My name is Rafa.

I know.

It says it on your car lot.

[Dog whimpers in the distance]




Ana, leave that. Come on.

Sit down. Have some breakfast.

"Rafael Rodriguez.

Auto Trader Magazine Car Dealer.

Year 2002. Runner up."

You won.

Runner up. Come on.
Sit down. Have your breakfast.

You should have it here
so that people can see it.

Okay, sure. Thanks.

Listen, don't-- Don't hold--
go like this-- don't hold it.

You're not gonna
kill somebody with it.

Hold it like this.

Like that. Like that.

No, that's not good. Come on.
Stop. Stop that.

Don't do that. You know better.

[Salsa music playing]

[Latin music playing]


To see if your mom's home.

See? Gate's open. She's back.

[Ana bumps car]


Okay, so he can take care
of you.

Go.
Uh-uh.

Come on. Let's go.
I got things to do.

[Rap music plays]



Let me in! Open the gate!

the gate like that

and you see what happens.

[Music stops]

[door opens]

What you doing with this kid?

Bringing her home.

Ana, get back here!

How you dare behave like this
after I talked to you before?

Show some respect, okay?

[Dishes clinking]


Why should I respect you?

You can't tell me what to do.

[Crash]
[slap]

[Ana screams]

putting food on the table.

Come back here!

[Car horn honks]


[kid laughs]

So, you are the guy
who's taking care of my kid?

Aren't you the guy
from the car lot?

Yes.

So, where is she?

She didn't wanna come in.

I'm sorry.
I can't look after your child.

Man, just chill out.
I'm gonna be out in a week.

Maybe even less, okay?

She needs to go
to Social Services.

You take her there, I'm never
gonna see her again, okay?

I'm not asking for much.

Just take care of her
for a couple days, man.

I'd do the same for you.

If you were in trouble,
I'd take care of your kid.

Where is the father?
[Woman] I don't know, man.

Somewhere in Palmas del Mar,
I think.

He's never around.

What am I supposed to do?

If I take her to him,
is he gonna understand?

Understand what?
That I'm a screw-up?

Listen, this is not about you.
This kid needs a parent.

You gotta call him.

I don't have his number.

Give me his name.

I'll keep you posted.

Thank you.

I'm taking you
to your father's house.

Sure, like he'd even know
who I am.

because I'm driving

halfway across the island.

[Latin music
playing over cell phone]

You like that?

Do you?

I found it in my phone.

[Latin music playing]

I'm putting in
your telephone number

in case we get separated.

Do you want my number?

No.

Here.
Put this address in your GPS.

The one on top.

Is that where my dad live?

No. It's on the way.

Somebody owes me money.

It'll only be a minute.
Stay in the car.

[Doorbell rings]

[dog barking in the distance]

[door opens]

Rafa.
Hi.

Sorry, I hope you don't mind.
I was in the neighborhood.

No, no. Of course.
Come in, please.

Oh.

Who's this?

My name's Ana.
I'm Rafa's neighbor.

He's giving me
a ride to my <i>papi</i> 's house.

May I use your bathroom?


[Door closes]

[glass chinks]

Hey, don't touch that.

[Woman] You look amazing.
Thank you. Likewise.

Rafael and I go way back.

We met when he opened
his first car lot.

Good times, right?

Good times.


this guy used to love to party.

We used to go dancing.

Yes.

He was always very kind to me.

Oh, bathroom.

Top of the stairs.

Do you want some iced tea?

Thank you.

[Toilet flushes]

<i>Puerto Rico investigates.</i>

<i>We asked him</i>
<i>about his campaign donations,</i>

<i>where he gets them from,</i>

<i>and what exactly</i>
<i>is his connection</i>

<i>to the Church</i>
<i>of the Well of God.</i>

<i>All that and more,</i>
<i>coming up next.</i>

<i>quite clear, okay?</i>

<i>I have heard all the stories</i>
<i>about my campaign funds</i>

<i>being used</i>
<i>for money laundering, all right?</i>

<i>And how I supposedly help</i>
<i>certain church organizations,</i>

<i>you know, embezzle funds</i>
<i>to buy condos in Florida.</i>

<i>And I also heard that--</i>
<i>that even they say that--</i>

<i>that I feed my enemies to--</i>
<i>to crocodiles.</i>

<i>I mean,</i>
<i>this is ridiculous, guys.</i>

<i>Please, come on.</i>

<i>I mean, this is--</i>
<i>this is fake news.</i>

<i>It's even worse than fake news.</i>

So, how's business?

Well, uh...

Actually, not what I would like.

Thank you.

[Romantic Latin music playing]

Well...

Camila, come on.

He was always very kind to me.

[Both moan]

[Ana clears her throat]

[Camila exhales]

Would you like some iced tea,
sweetheart?

Huh?

How much does she owe you?
What?

How much does she owe you?

Like a thousand dollars.

She's good for it.

You don't know that.

She's got that screwed up there,

and a shit ton of perfume,

the expensive kind, not spray.

[Camila sighs]

He needs the money you owe him.

I mean, only if-- only--
only if you-- if you--

if, if it's, you know,
if it's convenient at this time.

It's not exactly--


Rafa, I feel dreadful.


The crisis is affecting us all

in so many ways right now. I--

[Ana slurps]

You got the car out front.

I mean,
I can't even afford to run it.

What, with gas prices...
[Ana] Then you won't miss it.

We have our own tow truck.

It's a small one.

A thousand plus the hundred
I made us at the bar.

We make a good team, right?

I'm taking you
to your father's house.

I don't need your help.

Sure, you don't.

You'll be fine
when those guys come after you.

[Latin music playing]

[charm tinkling]

You need gas.

[Charm tinkling]

Wait in the car.

[Car door closes]

Want me to go pay?

[Doorbell chimes]

Hi, can you put 20 on pump four?

<i>Have you had enough politicians</i>

<i>who lie and cheat</i>

<i>and make promises</i>
<i>they can't keep?</i>

<i>Well, now's your chance</i>
<i>to make a real change.</i>

<i>Vote for Congressman</i>
<i>JosÃ© Maria Vega and...</i>

Do you have a restroom?

Out back.

Is it clean? Or kind of icky?

This is a gas station, honey.

Sometimes if it's really bad,

I prefer to wait. One time I--

Are you going
to give me the 20 bucks?

Shoot! I forgot to take it.
[Woman] Then you get it.

I'll go get it,
then I need your restroom.

<i>politician you can really trust.</i>

Oh, do you sell gummy bears?
[Woman] No.

[Doorbell chimes]

Let's go, Joe.

Go! Go!

[Car engine starts]

I just made us 20 bucks.

You didn't pay?

[Tires squeal]

What are you doing?

[Tires squeal]


No, no, no, no, no!

Now you're gonna go
back in there,

you're gonna say you're sorry
and give her back the $20.

You can't make me.

You're not my mother.

By the way,
your mother's in jail,

and that's exactly
where you're gonna end up

if you don't start
doing the right thing.

Now go in there,
tell her you're sorry.

What if I tuck it in the pump?

Go in there
and say you're sorry.

Tell her you made
an error in judgment.

Okay!



[doorbell chimes]

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.


The floor.



<i>...the fifth of August</i>

They're gone.


[charm tinkling]

[Latin music starts playing]

[music stops]

I forgot to give her
the 20 bucks.

[Sad song plays]

What are you doing?

I wanna show you something.

Why are we staring
at some dumb pond?

[Ana screams]

[Rafa laughs]

Thanks a bunch.

Now I'm all wet!

[Rafa chuckles]

It's a blowhole.

You just have to wait
for the right wave.

The wave comes in
underneath the rocks

and it blows out the blowhole.

Be careful, or you're gonna
end up like Saint Tino.

You ever heard
the story of Saint Tino?


Saint Tino was a local farmer

who was crippled,
couldn't walk well.

Be careful.

And he was walking his cow,

stopped by the water,

and the cow fell into the lagoon

and dragged Tino
into the lagoon.

The rope that Tino was holding
got tangled in his leg

and, ooh,
pulled him into the lagoon,

and this lagoon is really deep.

And he was going down

and he knew he was gonna drown,

and that was it.

As he was going down,

God took pity on him

because Tino--

Listen to this.

He was a good man,

he was humble,
and he was honest.

Suddenly, a wave came

and blew Tino
out of the blowhole,

up into the sky

and landed him on the grass.

God saved his life.


[Rafa] What?
Was he cured?

Like, he was
no longer a cripple.

No, I think
he was still crippled.

That's not such a great story.

What happened to the cow?
[Rafa] The cow?

Cow drowned.

<i>You have one new message.</i>



<i>in case you were thinking,</i>

I don't need any used cars,
okay?

<i>Just so we're clear,</i>

<i>I need to be paid in cash.</i>

How are you gonna get
the rest of the money?

You sure we going the right way?

Yup. Next right.

[Adventurous music plays]

in your father's address?

Check that map again.

You sure?


This doesn't have a signal.

It doesn't?

I guess it just dropped out,

but this was
definitely the right way.

[Both moan]

I don't remember
seeing any water on the map.

You did this on purpose!

[Ana grunts]

Don't shout at me.

I'm only eleven.

I don't have time for this, Ana.

Oh, you think I don't know that?

Just see
if you can get a signal.

Will you not jump on my car?

Give me the phone.

You've got a flat.


Oh!

[Rafa exhales]

Rafa?


See that?

I-- I lost my jack.

I wouldn't suppose you have
a spare jack you can lend me?

[Somber music plays]

[tense music plays]

Zuleika.



[Rafa grunts]

[Rafa exhales]


There you are.

I got us a jack.

Cool.

Okay, here we go.

Thank you very much.
We appreciate it.

We need to buy <i>caÃ±ita</i>
and sell it.

Are you out of your mind?
It's illegal.

If you get busted,

you're gonna end up
like your mother, in jail.

I don't get you.

You put a lot of money
on a dumb <i>gallo</i>,

but you won't do
something like this?

It is against the law.

I'm not a criminal.

I'm a car salesman.

Without any cars.

When are you
gonna show some hustle?

[Latin music plays]

It says there's a bar.

It's open 24 hours.

Exactly the right kind
of place to make a sale.

Go on.
[Rafa] Stay in the car.

[Man] Good?
Hey.


be interested in buying some...


What?
[Whispering] <i>CaÃ±ita.</i>

Why are you whispering?
I'm not sure.

[Man] Is it good?
It's very good.

You're gonna show me?

Bring it in?


Okay.

What the hell you doing?

People will
totally love this color.

They'll think it's flavored.

Flavored is a big seller.

You know, fruits.

I mean, that's what they say.

It's cool, right?

<i>CaÃ±ita.</i>

Yeah, that's not gonna fly.

Is it the color?

That's Smurf blue.
It's what the kids like.



Great idea!

What?

[Trunk closes]

[charm tinkling]

You should call your sons
sometime.

They might like
to hear from you.

[Adventurous music plays]


We're done for the night.

Unless you wanna drive.

I'm looking for someone.

I'm someone.

What do you want? I got...

Oh, no. A girl.

We got girls.

A young girl.

All our girls are young, <i>chico.</i>

Really young.
Like, ten years old.

No, no, no!
She's from my neighborhood.

She's a neighbor.

[Welder sizzling]

You okay?

Yeah.

[Welder sizzling]

Excuse me?

Excuse me?

Hello?

This car was stolen.
It's my car.

Somebody stole my car
and brought it over here.

I want my car back.

Hey!

I'm talking to you. Hey!


[welder sizzling]

Sir...

...you have my <i>papi</i> 's car.

I know the crisis
is affecting us all

in so many ways right now,

but since my older brothers
left the island,

and my mother passed,

my <i>papi</i> has had to raise me
all by himself.

And all the time,
he has had to carry on

cleaning gas station toilets.

I've spent my life in that car.

That car is my home.

Please, <i>seÃ±or,</i>
don't destroy it.

[Man tapping]

Okay, I'll give you 400 cash,
right now.

Maybe you should start
buying and selling used cars.

Are you at least gonna thank me?

get out of the car.

Get out of the car.
[Ana] Now what?

Come on, come here.

What do you want me
to thank you for, huh?

Breaking into my car

and then causing me
to lose my stock?

Oh, sure,
like that one's on me now.

Or maybe I should thank you

for almost getting beaten up
or maybe killed

because I went into the <i>barrio</i>
looking for you,

and some thugs
thought I was a pervert.

A what?
[Rafa] A pervert!

A pervert! Forget it!

Listen, I'm done going

throughout this island
acting like a babysitter.

I know you don't take
responsibility for any--

Okay, watch me
take responsibility.

Let's go.
Wait!

Stop it!
Come on, let's go. Come on!

Stop!
Come on.

Let go!
Let's go.

Come on, I'll show you
a little responsibility.

[Rafa] Come on.

you're squishing my arm!

[Bells tinkling]

This church
is gonna look after you.

'Cause, frankly, right now,
I can't help you anymore.

And if you're lucky, you're
gonna find some help in there.

Now, go.

Fine, you don't think
you need help?

Well, I do.



Say, hallelujah!


Â¶ <i>Sing hallelujah</i> Â¶



The gospel tells us

that Jesus addresses
each individual

he encounters,
whether rich or poor,

in terms
of their common humanity,

not in terms
of their bank accounts.

Reminds me of one
my favorites, John 12.

We heard how Mary
took an expensive ointment

to anoint the feet of Jesus.

"But why was this ointment
not sold for 300 denarii

and given to the poor?"

Asked his disciples accusingly.

Despite their protest,

Jesus received the gift

well worth a year's wages
for most people.

This is the same Jesus
who was born in a stall,

the same Jesus
who died on a trash heap.

What does this
tell us about our Lord?

It tells us

that Jesus
in His infinite wisdom,

His infinite wisdom,

a wisdom that is
sometimes perplexing,

yet always greater than ours,

allowed us
to enjoy the fruits of our labor

while still on earth.


a limited time,

but let me be an example

of what one can achieve
through God's blessing.

Can I hear "amen"?
Amen!

that He has sent this island,

we all share together,
is His will.



He knows we struggle.

While across the water

we imagine the wealth of others.


to the people of Puerto Rico,

a challenge we shall overcome.





The more we all give,

the more we receive.

[Crowd] Hallelujah!
Amen.


Amen!
[Crowd] Amen.

In a church?

Are you out of your mind?

Oh, in case you forgot.

You don't think I could've taken

Stuck with me?

You're showing
some hustle around here.

Either I just saw somebody

pretending they couldn't walk

taking money
from good church-going people

or I'm witnessing a miracle.

Which is it?

Miracle?

As a pastor, it is my duty

to try to help you
and your daughter.

Oh, he's not my dad.

What is your relationship
to this child?

Uncle.
Neighbor.

A neighbor
who tries to sell cars.

I'm more like a family friend.

No, just neighbor.

Ana would like to apologize.

Yes, I'm sure she would.

I'm sorry.

The church teaches forgiveness.

And penance.

Fraud is a serious matter.

Obviously, she's gonna--

She's gonna give back the money.

And perhaps a small atonement
could be made,

if, say, she did a little work
at the church.

Well, we'd be happy to come back
another time,

but right now

I'm kind of in a crisis.

Or we could call the police.

[Door opens]

[door closes]

Thank you.


It's good being on the road.

Isn't it?

Why don't we stay here

and never go back to San Juan?

You should bring your sons here.

It'd be really nice.

They have a busy life.

They have family,
they have kids.

What are their names?

NicolÃ¡s

and AndrÃ©s.

Why don't you see them?

You can just get
a flight to Miami

or get them to get a flight.

Cheers.

...who wishes

All right, Ana.

I want you to tell the story

exactly as we discussed

about how the church and prayer

has helped you live
with your disability, okay?

Thank you, Pastor Helen.

My name is Zuleika,

and this is my story.

When I was five,
my father became a drunk

and pushed me down some stairs.

I broke my legs.

They told me
I would never walk again.

A few days ago,

I met a kind man.

That's him right there.


through his misguided behavior.

He was a heavy gambler,

and he took tablets
for his vagina.


But he told me
the story of Saint Tino.

One day, Tino was leading
his cow beside a small lagoon

and the cow slipped on a rock
and fell in,

pulling Tino with him.

Tino thought he would drown.

So he put his hands together
and said a prayer.

Tino stood up and was amazed
to see that he could walk again.

A few days ago,
I went there myself

and I gently dipped my legs in,

and I said a prayer.


Oh, my God.



Gentlemen.

Open your hearts, everybody.

Tell your friends and family

about what you have seen
and heard today.

Bring them to our church to hear
this miracle for themselves.

for every atonement,

we can pay Diego on time,

and I bet I can get her
to raise our cut.

We're just trying to make it
through the crisis, Rafa.

[Sad song plays]

Come on, let's go. Bedtime.

Good night.



and this is my story.

When I was five,
my father became a drunk

and, in one
of his drunken rages,

he pushed me down the stairs.

I broke my backbone.

They told me
I would never walk again.

Until a few days ago, when I
heard the story of Saint Tino,

a crippled farmer who thought
God had forsaken him

because he was poor
and he couldn't walk well.

One day, Tino was walking
his favorite cow

beside a small lagoon

when the cow slipped on a rock
and fell in,

pulling Tino with him
into the dark depths.

Tino thought he would drown
because the cow was sinking,

so he tried to swim,
but he didn't have enough air.

So then he put his hands
together, he said a prayer.

And suddenly, the waters
of the well rose up.

Whoosh...

And placed him gently
on the grass,

as if God's hands
are made out of water.

Wait, let me explain.

After hearing that story,
I was inspired.

My friend took me there.

Using a child to make money?

No. Listen.

Embezzling? From a church?

I'm not embezzling from them.

It's more complicated than that!

I used to have
feelings for you, Rafael.

I said a prayer and...



Now I understand
why your business went bad.

Because you're a crook.

Because you are a crook!

Listen. Hey! Hey!

Camila.

[People cheering in the church]


[sad song plays]


Sir?

Sir.

Hey!

We're done here.

That's it. We're done.

Ana. Leave that.

Hey. Hey. Leave that.

Let's go. We're out of here.

You wanna call the police?
Go ahead. Call the police.

'Cause what you're doing here
is not only fraud,

you're taking advantage of
people who don't have anything

which is exactly what's wrong
with this island right now.

People like you coming in
and taking advantage.

And where are you from?

I'm from San Juan.

But you're not Puerto Rican.
I'm from Miami.

[Helen] Oh, yeah? Miami-Cuban?
Yes!

So you probably came here
to sell cars

because of
the Puerto Rican tax breaks?

I came here
for many reasons. Ana.

But you came here with the hope
of making more money

and paying less taxes.

So isn't that taking advantage?


Helen's given me a great job.

You never know how much money
there is inside this.

Ana has decided she wants
to stay with the church

for our summer camp.

Oh, Ana's decided?

Yes, she has.

Ana? Ana?

[Woman] Yeah.
I'd like to speak with her.

my father broke my spine

with a metal bar.

I was made to sleep
outside our yard

in a pen with the roosters.

Sometimes,
they would peck at me.

[Cell phone rings]

Diego.

You know
what has to happen next.

<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

<i>I don't have your money.</i>


Do what you gotta do.

<i>Drop me in the ocean somewhere.</i>

Whoosh!

The waters of the lagoon
rose up.

Tino was at the top floating,

<i>saved by the clear blue waters</i>

Finally, he was gently
placed down on the grass.

<i>It was as if God</i>

After hearing this story,

I wheeled myself up
to the lagoon.

I dipped my legs in

and I said a prayer

Oof.

[Ana] God bless you all.

Let's go, darling.

What time are we playing later?
I don't know.


I need my cut.

Well, that money
belongs to the church.

It's been donated.

We're giving it
to the Vega Campaign...

What?

...to make Puerto Rico
great again.

The church got
that money because of me,

because they believed my story!

No, dearie,
they liked your story

because it gave them hope,
and that made them feel good.

And that's your reward,

giving these people back
some hope.

We had a deal.

And that deal is done.

[Somber music plays]

Sir, is this your vehicle?

Yeah.

It's in a handicap spot.
[Rafa] Shit.

Sorry, I'll move it.
[Officer] What's that?

What?


Soda.

It belonged to a friend of mine.

I gave her a ride,
left it in the car.

Can you open the trunk, please?

Hands behind your back, sir.
Please.


Stop it!

You can't do that.

Are you two together?

No.
Yes.

He's taking care of me.

My mother's in prison.

I have a moonshiner

Is this a joke?

Look, you want

The man's a loser.

Even losers win sometimes.

You just gotta trust me, Diego,

We just gotta show some hustle.

We know God is smiling upon you

Today, you are blessed.

Our crisis will soon be over.

Amen.

Anyone?


Ah, welcome.

Can you-- Can you help them up?

And you are?

My name is Rafael Rodriguez.

And what is it you do, Rafael?

I run a business

And God willing,
that business is prospering.

We all do what we have to do

Let me say a few words
for you then.

Lord--
Let me say a few words for you.


There is a man in the front row
seat in the aisle

and he's got a suit on.

He's from the Department
of the Treasury

and he wants to have
a serious talk with you

regarding your illegal donations
to the Vega campaign.

As you said,
fraud is a serious business.

You can't prove anything.

[Ana clears her throat]

So many times.

Yeah, there you go, tough guy.

Yeah.

Looks like your mom's

What's the matter with you?
Come on, let's go.

Let's go, slowpoke.

Get a move on.

Show me some hustle.

I'll show you some hustle!

[Rafa laughs]

This enough hustle?

Come on!
I'll hustle you up.

I'll give you
something to hustle!

[Latin music plays]

You know what you need?

You need a car.

A cool car,

a second-hand car

from Rafa's Quality Cars.

Name it, we have it!

We got white cars, one owner.

We got blue cars

filled with half a tank of gas,

four-nine-nine-five.

We got SUVs, like new,

nine-nine-three-nine.

So many cars, we don't know
what to do with them.

They're cheap,
they're old, they're classic.

I can wash it for you,
but I can't drive it.

I'm only eleven!

Rafa's Quality Cars.

He doesn't just have
the coolest cars in Puerto Rico,

but he is the nicest guy,
and you can trust him.

That's my promise to you.
