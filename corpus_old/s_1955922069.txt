Journey of Man

I don't remember how it all began

...and I had no idea
where it would end.

I only knew feelings

sensations

And so began my journey.

I was born with only instincts
as my guides.

And I knew them
when they came to me

In those childhood days
they never left my side.

They were all I knew.

and all I needed.

I 'm not sure if I saw these things

or dreamed them

But true or imagined.

they filled my heart with joy.

Then one day I learned that joy
has a friend called fear.

But my faithful instincts showed me
that with fear comes courage.

And courage has another friend,
called wonder.

In my youth, there were
many tracks and few signposts

But I was young and bold.

...and on my way
to new adventures

My childhood fantasies
were behind me now.

Ahead lay many
mysteries and marvels

I had outgrown
my childhood guides

I knew I could be
strong and daring

I was a young man
with a young man's dreams

Everything was possible

...as I raced along
on my great adventure

Then one day I stopped
my headstrong rush and paused.

Like standing
on the shoreline of a dream

...I sensed a power
that I couldn't explain

Then it came to me

When I became a man

I learned that harmony and union
make each of us complete.

And I saw its name was love

It was time to act like a man
make a deal.

Wealth and power could buy me
all the love I needed.

I no longer needed childhood
fantasies and youthful dreams

I had found love
and had to own its secret.

As a man,
I had achieved my goals

My journey had been a success

And yet.

sometimes, distant memories
returned to haunt me.

Childhood visitations
of half-forgotten friends

And occasionally doubts and troubles
invaded my seclusion.

In that moment, time fell away.

My years turned to dust.

I was young again

Now I remembered
where I began my journey.

As a child full of dreams

full of faith

and full of love

At last my journey
could be completed.

Each of you was born with three keys
to the doors of your journey.

The first is for your dreams

It lets you make
the impossible possible

The second is for your faith

It tells you to believe in youth

And above all, the third is for love

...the instinct
to respect each other

Dreams, faith and love

With these three,
anything is possible

It is your journey,
but it is our destination
