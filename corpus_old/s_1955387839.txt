Then we put them in the store. But soon we sat cars.

Yes, otherwise Black did not send me here.

Hello, you have a customer.

We're closed. - I'll let these TVs.

At the expense of Black. - From Black?

Is that you, snoepie? Why do you make so much noise?

Are you here? Everyone is worried sick.

What's wrong with you?

Pull out. - What was that?

Blue looks to show a porn cheated.

His grandmother wants back again.

What's wrong with your phone? Everybody calls you.

Which is broken. - That'll do.

T-Lay has Lola Mae robberies, Andrew was arrested and I'm ...

What? - Fired. You're hiding something.

Not at all.

Black, I knew it.

Now I'm really in trouble.

Gentlemen, I do not know if you realize how serious the situation is ...

but America's communications system at risk.

Take a seat.

Uncle Dalton ... Dalton works at the Cellular Two fraud department.

He helped us very well. - And it was a pleasure.

His information you find in the report.

You go pick up someone. One Little ...

Little Broder. I want you to hear him to the highest degree.

And these two individuals ...

Black and Blue, are probably the ringleaders.

But we do not want them prematurely alarming.

Not yet.

Dit is nou de FBI, James.
High-tech surveillance.

Lovely.

There he is.

Halt. - Who are you?

Put your weapon down. You're under arrest.

You must always have the black.

I needed five minutes. - Five weeks will mean you.

T-Lay en z'n bende.

Black. Blue. Where are you?

Wait a minute. Look. Look at this. Over there.

Are not you scared?

Should you have?

Get him.

Will you fight? Bring it on.

What are you doing?

I kick your ass.

Is this what you want?

T-Lay is felled.

Who won?

Listen, asshole. Your fingerprints on those chips.

I can no longer keep him in check.

And I do not want to. - Val nice death.

I say no one silly nut.

What is this?

He is unconscious.

You should take care that mask.

You've ruined it all.

Because you're such a hothead.

Idiot, now I have nothing worked for ten years.

It was your idea. I knew it would be 't nothing.

What is happening here? - A quarrel between friends.

I go to the carpool place.

Can I make a call?

The Lord is my shepherd. - God help us. Cunt.

He leads me to calm waters.

Do you know the holy word?

I know how much money is in it.

This is holy oil, against demons.

That's for my eyes. It needs a prescription.

Give my purse but returned.

Where is my son?

I am ready. Backward, Satan.

You go to the conflagration. I'm not afraid.

Fade, demons. Look that crack junkies now.

Your mom. You go for a thousand years in hell.

I banish you. Fade, demons.

I have holy water. You all.

Chaka Khan.

There's my boy.

What the blanket will think? Am I not again 't Year Mother.

Sister Wanda will it be again. That bitch.

Beware.

You are now going to eight times a week for Bible study.

And you may also host a second address anymore.

I have not finished yet. You are about to polish the furniture blanket ...

and you get house arrest.

How long? - Forever.

No phone calls.

I gave you a simple command, and what is the result?

A suspect escaped from verhoorcel ...

and you are missing.

You get another chance.

That was all. And no more blunders.

Black and Blue, or you're very stupid ...

or you're mad that you think you can win it from Roscoe.

I do not want a sermon, but weapons.

It's your life.

I just mean. The weapons we have.

Where are the car keys?

That's'm not. - Where is he?

There he sits.

That can not be our car. - Calm down but.

Look, you called half an hour ago.

Give me two hours and you get one of those.

We should have called sooner.

I'm going with you. Are you going away?

Stupid Ice Cube imitation. - Hold on, soon you die.

Do you think it works?

Ever seen one?

You keep the engine running and I trade everything.

Black, what are you doing here? They search everywhere.

Give me something to drink.

What do you want? - Talk to Roscoe.

With Roscoe? Okay. But then he makes you surely.

So you do not want a babe? - We do not like whores.

Wives are like joints. Trekkie take and pass.

Let your dough's see. Eight in the corner.

I am below. We make thousands of.

Is he sometimes good? - I've just bought dope for.

Phone.

With whom am I speaking? I hope it comes to dough.

With Black. - How dare you come here?

Hebrews is m'n point?

I come for. Since I could not do anything.

But I'm as mad as you are. I've got a bomb on me.

If I do not get my way, I blow everything ...

because I am who sat flights.

Those two criminals ...

are having fun in the strip club.

You keep only live if you pay 70 grand plus interest.

I got a better deal for you. We've got a cell phone commercial.

With us you earn more than those of your partners.

I'm the boss on the street.

I have contacts and the black box.

But T-Lay have to leave me alone.

Blue and I do all the work and let us tell you.

Do not worry about T-Lay. That is the brother of my wife.

I'm a real businessman. I have a nose for business.

So you first go to pay off 70 grand ...

and then we talk about a partnership.

Clear. - I'll call you.

You'll get your money. I call you.

One Time can not save you now.

I'm talking regularly with Roscoe. So leave me alone.

You think you're the only armed?

T-Lay, come up ...

Black before doing something you can not.

Go quickly.

This is a personal thing for me.

I get cold.

You go wash dishes. I see you on the street, wijffie.

Greetings to you and your girls.

Piss off.

New plans. Find his contact and the black box.

We take the market over and finish them off.

Why will concentrate on me?

What happened?

We can breathe a sigh. I can talk to Roscoe.

There they are.

Those guys watching us.

What guys? - That one over there.

How do you mean? - They keep an eye on us.

They look and look and look.

What are you doing?

Think a bit about my bladder.

Crawl out and close the hood.

Just pretend you can fly.

Shut the hood.

Finally do some good.

What is wrong with you?

That will cost you ten dollars. - Later.

Take it easy. - Come and get me, acorns.

You want us dead?

I drive by.

What are you doing on the road? What's wrong with you?

They'll be.

Is everything alright?

Fat Ass, what are you doing here? Go quickly to your mother.

Help even.

He's heavy. - Hurry up.

Why not let that fool lie?

We go to the place where we always hang out.

Leave it just lie to him.

Here's it.

I make him open it.

Black box. White cop. - The right cover you need.

See if they watch it.

My back. - Help him to his feet.

No more wisecracks. Otherwise I do what.

Those guys did not give me any dough.

You are such mobile phones.

What's he saying?

Listen smoothness, men. We do not want trouble.

Kill them, man. - The mobile phones are okay.

We give you three days remaining and a free pager.

And a candy jar.

These are my cronies.

Who calls he?

Black. Blue. Acorns.

CENSORED

Goddamn.

They did not find us here? - Of course not.

What a stench.

And it does not mess up.

Stoopid, watch them. I'm going to shit.

Shut up. I'm done with you.

If they do anything, bang them down.

Your suit is too tight. Get tasty one yeast infection.

A movement and you go to it.

Do not move. Otherwise I get you down.

What are we doing? That bunch of petty thieves will kill us.

I'm thinking. - Soon we'll go out.

Quiet. We'll just go a little smoke.

Why? What are we going to smoke?

As we go to the angels, I want some substance, you know?

Hear's, Mr. gangbanger.

Should we not first be effe high?

I got a joint with me. You may also choose a pair of pull.

No fooling. - No, we're going to die.

Finally, you do something good.

A branch with two apples. - And a small garden.

He takes something out of his pocket.

Would you be my partner?

Or did you think to marry?

I thought indeed. - I mean it.

A new sex line. You just need to pick up the phone.

I'll find work. - Yes.

Keep you my nice thing? - Always.

Indulge me once.

Dirty bastard, I want my money back.
