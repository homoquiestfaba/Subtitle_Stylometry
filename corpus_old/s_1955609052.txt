<i>Ah, Venice Beach... a city built on contrast.</i>

<i>Decade old concrete buildings layered
between million dollar homes.</i>

<i>Worn out beach bums litter the same
streets your cousins from Oklahoma...</i>

<i>...visit every summer.</i>

<i>Every weird dive bar you love is being
pushed out by some shitbag tech company.</i>

<i>And somewhere between the ruckus,
you'll find this guy...</i>

<i>...Venice's only licensed detective.</i>

You just gotta live your life.
It goes by so fast. It's like a whisper.

<b><font color="#408080">JOHN:</font></b> <i>That's my boss, Steve Ford...</i>

<i>...a self-appointed figurehead
in the community.</i>

<i>Takes that job very seriously.</i>

Before you know it, you're 12 years old,
and then where are you?

I don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I made.

It starts like this, a little bit of weed,
and then a little bit of blow, okay?

And then a couple bottles
of tequila every week.

And hookers three times a week.

And, yeah, it's fun, in the moment,
it's fun, but let me tell you something.

Those moments always end up
when your head feels like this big...

...like a bus ran over it.

You happy about that?
No, you're not happy about that.

Then not too long after that,
you're sitting on your kitchen floor...

...buck naked, you got a gun in your mouth...

...and all you're thinking
about is, is today the day?

Is today the day I pull the trigger? Bang!

But you got a right to live...

...and you gotta fuckin' live right,
you get me?

All right.

Let's go. This is a skate park,
come on. Let's go skate.

<b><font color="#408080">JOHN:</font></b> <i>I always wanted to be
a private detective...</i>

<i>...and with Steve being the only outfit
in town, I really had no other choice...</i>

<i>...but to work with him.
Which is good... I think.</i>

And seeing as he was busy mentoring
the local youth of today...

...I was left to finally get a shot
at cracking my first case...

...and it has led me here,
to Nola Tuiasosopo...

...at least, I believe I'm pronouncing
that right, I don't know, she's Samoan.

Not that there's anything wrong with that...

...some of them have tricky
last names, some of them.

Well, I'll edit that later. Uh...

Missing since July. I just spotted her
at the corner of sixth and Oakwood.

And, let me tell you, Steve was not
exaggerating, Nola is very attractive.

Scratch that, she is very, very insanely...

...why isn't she a professional
model-attractive.

Anyway, by the looks of it, she's going
into a support group of some kind.

I'm guessing Alcoholics Anonymous, just...

Hello, my name's Rick and I'm a sex addict.

<b><font color="#408080">MEDIATOR:</font></b> Hi, Rick.

My poison's pornography.

It started back in Catholic school
and got progressively worse.

I'm currently logging about 40 hours a week.

That's a full-time job.

I've got premium subscriptions
to the big four...

...PornHub, RedTube,
Reality Kings and Brazzers.

Not to mention, EskimoTube...

...JizzHut...

Oh, God, I'm a monster!

Jesus, right?

Would you like to share with the group?

Hm?

Would you like to share with the group?
The group? Uh...

...no! No, I'm good. I'm good to just listen.

That's not really how it works.

Everyone is required to participate
on their first night, please.

Well, if it's required.

Okay.

I'm John...

...and I'm a sex addict.
<b><font color="#408080">GROUP:</font></b> Hi, John.

Hello. Uh, yeah, I just love sex.

I love getting it,
I love giving it.

I love it too much and I get it too much,
that's my main problem.

On that sex road, I've got my thumb out,
waiting to get on one of the sex cars.

I am also logging about 40 hours a week...

...but on sex, not just
jacking off like this guy, right?

Full-blown sex. And, actually,
come to think of it...

...it's more than 40 hours.
So, I'm doing time and a half.

I should get paid my overtime. I mean,
obviously I'm not condoning sex for money.

That's bad, right?
We all agree, would you? Good.

I really just have sex with...
any old thang that comes my way.

There's some limits, obviously, age...

...18 and below is no... <i>no bueno,</i> no good.

Upwards, though, is where I really shine...

...50, 60, 80, 90, centennials...

Okay! Uh, thank you for sharing, John.
All right, you got it.

Are you following me?

No, no, no, I'm not following you.
No, no, don't mace me!

I'm not a stalker. I...

...I am technically following you,
but not in a stalker way...

...just as a professional...
strictly professional.

Look, your brothers
hired my boss to find you...

...and that's where I come in.

They want you to come home,
okay, they miss you.

I could drive you,
at least to my boss' house.

In a professional way...

...not as a maniac or a pervert,
on either parts.

<b><font color="#808000">(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)</font></b>

<b><font color="#408080">JOHN:</font></b> Yeah, uh, I'll let her know.

All right, so you'll be

...and then in the morning we can figure out
how best to deal with your brothers.

Well, how about that Rick guy?
40 hours a week?

I mean, that's a serious
commitment to masturbation.

Yeah, hopefully he's changing
hands every once in a while.

I mean, if you don't,
that's carpal tunnel syndrome...

And the blistering, and chafing.
Ugh. Yeah.

a little tub of like, Neosporin.

A lot of money to buy cocaine.

I was planning on using that later.
Is there a back door to this place?

Man, fuck you.

Thanks very much.
You're really good.
