[ Grunts ]

Midland City, come on.

Oh, how can you stand
that smell out there ?

Oh, shut the door !

Oof! Oof.
-<i>[ Gears Grinding ]</i>

Oh, it's all poisoned now.

Think of the shit most
of these factories make.

Raspberry air freshener,
gourmet cat food,

plastic doughnuts.

l used to be
a conservationist.

Used to weep and wail when l heard
about people shooting bald eagles...

from helicopters and all that,
but l gave it up.

l laugh about it now. l say,
'' Up your ass ! Man needs its gas !''

<i>Y</i>ou gotta be kiddin' me.

<i>Y</i>ou ever read a story
called ''Gilgongo'' ?

About a planet that becomes
too unpleasant because there was
too much creation going on ?

Gil what ?
Gilgongo.

Extinct.
l gotta take a leak.

l understand that to mean
you're gonna steal a mirror.

Steal a mirror ?
Leaks.

The holes between
two universes.

Don't get too near to that leak.
<i>Y</i>ou don't want to wind up in
the other universe, do you ?

Maybe you should take some
more time to relax, Gramps.
Time is a joker.

The only solution to any problem
is time. How lucky can you get ?

All right,
that's 23.50 for the diesel.

Don't forget to clean
the side leak there.

The what ?
The leak.

<i>The mirror!</i>
Oh, the mir-- Oh, well, that's funny.

How about you ?
<i>Y</i>ou having any... problems ?

No. No, l, uh--
[ Sighs ]

l don't know how to say it, but--
[ Stammering ]

l guess it started with
the <i>Tugboat Annie</i> movie. <i>Y</i>eah ?

-<i>[ Laughs ]</i>
-<i>[ Bird Squawks ]</i>

l don't know. Maybe it was panties
on a clothesline...

or Mother's bra

we don't have any children, so, you

Harry, sit down, please.

Sit down !

Okay. Damn it. Oh, geez--
[ Grunts ]

Sit down !
[ Grunts ]

[ Clears Throat ]
<i>That</i>'<i>s good.</i>

<i>Y</i>ou did sit down.

why did you sit down, Harry ?

<i>[ Bird Squawking ]</i>

Because you
asked me to, Dwayne.

Right. Good.

l asked you to sit down, and you did.
<i>Y</i>ou do that, don't you, Harry ?

People ask you to do things,
and you do that. why is that, Harry ?

[ Murmurs ]
Uh, what are you saying, Dwayne ?

what are <i>you</i> saying, Harry ?

well, what
l'm saying is that l--

[ Laughs ]
l guess that...

l don't really understand
my own statement, you know ?

ls that why you're telling people
that l've changed, Harry ?

<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i> / <i>just said</i>
<i>you</i>'<i>re behaving a little differently.</i>

lt's-- l meant it
as a compliment.

<i>Y</i>ou meant it as a compliment.
<i>Yes</i>.

So you weren't happy
with the way l was before.

Are you sure this doesn't have
anything to do with the fact...

that only you know
that l was adopted, Harry ?

l want the truth !

Good God, Dwayne, no ! Come on.
we're army buddies. Army !

<i>You weren</i>'<i>t in the army,</i>
<i>Harry, remember?</i>

<i>You stayed home.</i>
[ Sighs ]

l was in the Signal Corps.

<i>Y</i>ou were not in the army.

Harry.

l have never let the fact that you have
the name of a Buick come between us.

Have l, Harry ?
No.

Because you can't help that.
No.

lt's not your fault.
Right.

-<i>Y</i>ou can't change that, can you, Harry ?
-Mm-mm.

But this is Hawaiian week.

<i>Y</i>eah.

l suggest you go get
with Vernon Garr.

Have him get you
some cotton waste.

Soak it in blue Sunoco.

And l want you to burn
your entire wardrobe.

Do you understand what l'm saying ?
<i>Y</i>eah.

Now, look, in the old days,

when we first started selling new cars,
we sold them to older people.

Under those circumstances,
it was perfectly all right
to dress the way you dress.

Hey, you could dress
like a mortician.

<i>Y</i>ou could dress like my Aunt Clarice
for that matter.

But doggone it, Harry !

<i>Y</i>ou seem to be
forgetting something !

we are selling the most aggressively
designed automobile on the road today...

for people that are looking
for unsurpassed driving excitement.

<i>But look at you.</i>
<i>You</i>'<i>re dressed like an undertaker.</i>

Now, Harry,
l have some good news.

Modern science has given us
a whole new wonderful array of colors...

with exciting names like red, blue,
orange, yellow, pink.

Ah.
Am l making myself clear ?

[ Smacks Lips ]

why don't you come right out
and say it, Dwayne ?

Say what, Harry ?

That l like to wear women's clothes.
-<i>[ Gong Pounding ]</i>

<i>Y</i>eah.

<i>Y</i>eah.

No. No.
[ Laughs ]

No, no, no, no. well--
[ Stammering ]

[ Smacks Lips, Blows Raspberry ]
Not exactly.

Then why do you want me to say you
like to wear women's clothes, Harry ?

l don't, Dwayne. l don't.
l swear to God l don't.

Then what are you saying ?

l'll change. l'll change.

<i>Y</i>ou'll change ?
<i>Y</i>es.

<i>Y</i>ou'll change ?
<i>Y</i>es.

l have your word on that ?
Absolutely.

lt's Hawaiian week.
l've got to be able to count on you.

<i>Y</i>es, you can.

So you change.
Mm-hmm.

And don't you worry about me changing.
No, no, no, no.

That's fair, isn't it ?
Oh, absolutely. That's more than fair.

That's not too much to ask.
No, no, no.

Good God, no.

And l wanna be friends
like before.

Friends ?
<i>Y</i>eah.

Buddies ?
Buddies.

Buddies.

<i>Y</i>ou can go, Harry.

That's enough !
Oh !

Can you tell the listening

Art, Monty.
They can expect art.

Did l ever tell you about my trip
to headquarters in Michigan ?

when you won the Golden Sales Award ?
<i>Y</i>es.

Mm-mm.

l was given a tour
of the research facility.

Do you know
what impressed me the most ?
what ?

The place where they do
everything to cars that
you're not supposed to do to cars.

/ <i>remember seeing a sign</i>
<i>on the door of the building...</i>

<i>where they did</i>
<i>all this torture.</i>

lt said,
'' Destructive Testing.''

l remember looking at that sign
and thinking, is this what l'm here for,

to see just how much a man
can take without breaking ?

l've lost my way, Francine.

Oh.

Take my hand and lead me
out of the woods.

<i>Y</i>ou're just tired, honey.
l'm way beyond tired.

[ Coughing ]
we're here visiting with Fred T. Barry--

Maybe we should take you
to see a doctor ?

l don't need to hear what
a doctor has to say, Francine.

l've heard what every person
in Midland City's had to say twice.

[ Together]
which one of us would you like, Dwayne ?

<i>[ Echoing ]</i>
<i>Which one of us would you like, Dwayne ?</i>

-<i>[ Echoes ] Would you like, Dwayne ?</i>
<i>Dwayne ?</i>

Paper pulping.
<i>Y</i>eah, paper pulping.

They got so many books down there,

<i>don</i>'<i>t you think ?</i>

well, he, uh, was self-educated,
if that's what you mean.

He didn't finish high school,
but he could quote Shakespeare.

''All the world's a stage. All the men
and women are merely players.''

<i>Y</i>eah. Didn't make any sense.

lt was chaos.

<i>Y</i>ou got that right.

why would you ever read that nutty story
if you didn't have to ?

why ?

lt takes all kinds of people
to make up a world.

<i>[ Phone Rings ]</i>

Dwayne Hoover's Exit 1 1 Motor Village.
May l help you, please ?

Just one moment, please.

lt's for you, Mr. Hoover. Oh, l guess
you're not accepting calls today.

Unless l take a g.d. memo,
l forget every little thing--

[ Muffled ]
what are you doing ?

[ Sighs ]
Hello ?

My name is Horace Durenwurst.
l am with the E.P.A.

l'd like to ask you some
questions regarding the soil
toxicity at Sugar Creek Estates.

lf that man calls back,
you tell him l've moved away.

Tell him l've moved to Manitoba.
lt's in Canada.

Oh. Oh.
-<i>[ Elephant Trumpeting ]</i>

[ Ringing ]

[ Sighs ]

Hello ?
Grace, he didn't say anything.
He didn't do anything.

He just stood there.
Fuck him, Harry.

The grass skirt
fell off and, uh--

To him obviously l'm revolting.

Harry, how many times do l have
to tell you not to be ashamed
of what's underneath ?

Oh, God, let's just get
to Hawaii as soon as we can.

-<i>[ Objects Clattering ]</i>
<i>Y</i>es. <i>Y</i>es, you know, Grace,
l think you're right.

l know l'm right.
<i>Y</i>ou're so wise, Grace.

<i>Y</i>ou know, l'll get us
two tickets to Hawaii.

l'll fix the drawing.
l'll get us two tickets to Hawaii.

Oh, that's the best idea
you've had since you quit therapy.

<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Oh, boy, oh, boy! Look at that!</i>

<i>What</i>'<i>s that all about, those co-ed</i>
<i>sex orgies they have in college ?</i>

lt's a science fiction novel
written several years ago.

The premise is that life's an experiment
by the creator of the universe.

<i>He wants to test a new creature</i>
<i>he</i>'<i>s thinking of introducing</i>
<i>into the scheme of things.</i>

The creature has the ability
to make up his own mind.

All the other creatures
are fully automated robots.

Robots ! That does not describe me,
Andy wojeckowzski, no, sir !

l'm my own boss !
Right down the highway, baby ! Come on.

The book takes the form
of a long letter...

from the creator of the universe
to the experimental creature.

<i>That sounds nice. So where do</i>
<i>the naked sorority girls come in ?</i>

They don't.
<i>They don</i>'<i>t ?</i>

That's just... stupid.
l mean, that's dumb.

/ <i>mean, who</i>'<i>d want to publish</i>
<i>something like that ?</i>

<i>Who</i>'<i>d want to write something</i>
<i>like that ? That</i>'<i>s just my opinion.</i>

<i>[ Laughs ]</i>
<i>You know what</i> /'<i>m saying ? Man!</i>

Stupid.

<i>[ Harry ] You know those glasses</i>
<i>that Dwayne wears ?</i>

He doesn't need 'em.
He just wears 'em because
he thinks it makes him look smart.

<i>He</i>'<i>s bald too.</i>

<i>That</i>'<i>s why he combs his hair</i>
<i>over to the side like that</i>
<i>to cover up the bald spot.</i>

<i>When the wind blows,</i>
<i>it stands straight up.</i>

<i>He looks like Baby Huey.</i>

<i>He</i>'<i>s got a small penis too.</i>

l suppose we all want to have
large penises though, don't we ?

Anyway, here, fill out this entry form,
and l'll take care of everything else.

l'm not goin' anywhere, man !

well, that's the point. <i>Y</i>ou don't
have to.Just fill this out for me.

l'll take care of the rest.
Drawing's this afternoon.

Hey, Mr. Hoover !
Oh,Jesus Christ !

<i>Tell him you saw me.</i>

[ Horn Honking ]

<i>Y</i>ou haven't seen me !

[ Sniffing ]

<i>[ Fanfare ]</i>

Ohh. And the winner is...

<i>[ Applause ]</i>

...will give you

including Maui !

-<i>[ Cheering ]</i>
How about that wayne Hoobler,

<i>Yes!</i>

<i>And now, this, this voyage</i>--

where what is the, uh--

Oh, my God, Harry.
Shut your mouth.

wonderful, beautiful
sanctuaries of peace.

The peace of it all and...

the terrible, horrible,
horrible war years where--

<i>where all the private clubs...</i>
He was never in the army.

-<i>and down and down</i>
<i>into the sordid underbelly!</i>
what's gotten into Harry ?

Down into the bottom
where it's members only !

Geez, this is live.
-<i>And the cruel name-calling.</i>

The naming, naming !
The terrible hurt !

But the hunger,
the wonderful hunger...

for some sort of full play,

full swing, plenty of rope,
a little elbow room.

No more mountains !
No more mountains !

Oh, l'm sorry. Sorry.

l've got the tickets right here.
No, the tickets are--

well, l had the tickets.
l have tickets. They're right here.

Oh ! Oh !

<i>[ Groans ]</i>
<i>The arts festival awaits me.</i>

[ Grunts ]

[ Grunting ]

Treat me like a cockroach,

Feast your eyes...

She's goin'.

<i>[ Dwayne ]</i>
/ <i>just have too many cars. That</i>'<i>s all!</i>

How are you this evening ?
what a pleasure.

ls there anything--
[ Groans ]

[ Mumbling ]

Please, someone

Sorry, Mr. Hoover. l did not realize

-<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

[ Hiccups ]

Mr. Trout.

<i>[ Woman Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Welcome to Midland City Arts Festival.</i>

<i>The AmeriTel</i> /<i>nn invites</i>
<i>you to join us tonight</i>
<i>in our cocktail lounge at 6.00 p.m....</i>

<i>to celebrate the first annual</i>
<i>Midland City Arts Festival.</i>

l look perfect
for my mission.

<i>[ Birds Twittering ]</i>

Not now. Not now.

The Abominable Snowman
has arrived.

Kidnapped from the slopes
of Mount Everest.

Taken as slave to a bordello
in Rio deJaneiro.

l've come to the arts festival
in Midland City...

to have myself acknowledged
before l die...

as a great artist
l believe myself to be.

<i>Mr. Trout,</i>
/ <i>would know you anywhere.</i>

Marlo, his bags, please.

<i>Y</i>es, ma'am.
Take these to his suite.

Can l take your hat ?
How do you know who l am ?

lt had to be you.
Nobody's ever known who l was before.

<i>[ Rosewater ]</i>
<i>Kilgore Trout!</i>

l am Eliot Rosewater,
your greatest admirer.

<i>Y</i>ou're Rosewater ?

<i>Y</i>ou don't look like a person
who reads those magazines.

/ <i>have gathered to this date</i>
<i>only 4 1 of your novels...</i>

and 63 of your short stories.

And, of course,
l've read them all.

<i>Y</i>ou've read that much of my stuff?
<i>Of course.</i>

Please, have a seat.

we are proud...

to be the first community
to acknowledge...

the greatness of Kilgore Trout.

Midland City is ready
for a renaissance.

And you, sir,
shall be our Leonardo.

[ Panting ]

l regret that l must leave immediately
on Rosewater Foundation business.

But the honor, sir,

has been entirely mine.

Let's go.
l need my shot.

That kid has books of mine ?

<i>Y</i>es, and he let me
read them all.

l loved them.

[ Groaning ]

More flowers than
at a gangster's funeral.

Midland City seems to be gettin'
behind the arts in a great big way.

well, like
Mr. Rosewater said--

teach us
to dance and sing...

and laugh and cry.

Do l look like a dancer
or, or a singer or a man of joy ?

would a man nourished by beauty
look like this ? Open your eyes.

My eyes are opened.

And l see someone
who has dared to walk...

through the fires of truth
to the other side...

and come back
to tell us about it.

[ lnhales Deeply ]

lf there is anything you need--
l mean, <i>anything</i>--

don't be afraid to call me.

Ting-a-ling.

Hmm.

<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

Kilgore Trout.

Kilgore Trout.

<i>[ Man ] And just flap it</i>
<i>right up to a blank white canvas.</i>

<i>Then</i> / <i>would put Day-Glo bars</i>
<i>around it, and call it caged shit.</i>

That's what l would do.
Oh, man.

[ Chattering lndistinctly ]

Breakfast of champions.

<i>Y</i>ou said that the last time
you brought me my martini.

l say it every time
l serve a martini, Mr. Hoover.

That's probably why God invented
these little small towns,

so people could keep saying the same
stupid jokes over and over again.

l just like to
cheer people up.

That's all.

Okay.

No.

Mr. Hoover, would you
just do me a favor, please ?

l just-- l just would--
l would love the honor...

of you signing my wrist.

l want to show it
to my father.

He's sick in the hospital,
and the bills are just pilin' up.

lt would really impress him.
lt would.

Thanks a lot.
Nothin' special.

Just your autograph
would be great.

<i>Y</i>eah, they opened him up
and it just keeps gettin' worse.

Don't know what
we're gonna do.

There it is.
There's that smile.

Just love it.
we just-- we just love you. we do.

And when you said ''bird ca-ca''
on TV the other day--

Ca-ca.
''ca-ca--''

my dad laughed for
the first time in two years.

Thanks. we just-- we just trust
you so much. we do. Thanks.

ls this it ? ls this for me ?

/<i>t</i>'<i>s mine. What are</i>
<i>you doing with it ?</i> /<i>t</i>'<i>s mine.</i>

what are you doing ?
''<i>Dear, sir.</i>

<i>Poor sir, brave sir.</i>

<i>Y</i>ou are an experiment
of the Creator of the Universe.

<i>Y</i>ou are the only creature in the
entire universe who has free will.''

That's godlike
with a little ''g''.

<i>[ Lounge ]</i>

<i>Take my hand</i>

l'm a stranger in paradise

''<i>Y</i>ou are the only one who has
to figure out what to do next.

And why.''

That's exactly right. How did
you know-- How did you know this ?

'' Everybody else is a robot,
a machine.

Some persons like you,
while others seem to hate you.

<i>And you must wonder why.</i>

They are simply liking
and hating machines.

All of this has made
you pooped and demoralized.''

<i>Y</i>ou see, this is me.
l am pooped and demoralized.

<i>[ Continues ]</i>

lf this isn't nice,
what is ?

<i>Out of the common place</i>

lnto the rare

Somewhere in space

''<i>Y</i>ou are surrounded by machines whose
only purpose is to stir you up...

in every conceivable way...

so that the Creator of the Universe
can watch your reactions.''

wait, there's more. There's more.
This is it.

''The Creator of the Universe
would now like to apologize,

not only for the capricious
jostling companionship
he provided during the test,

but also for the trashy stinking
condition of the place itself.''

The robots have been programmed
for millions of years to abuse it...

so it would be a poisonous, festering
cheese by the time you got here.

He also programmed the robots
to crave sexual intercourse
more than anything else...

so it would be crowded
when you got here.
<i>Y</i>ou bet you.

He had the robots kill each
other by the millions for this
purpose only that you be amazed.

They have committed every possible
atrocity and every possible kindness...

just to get a reaction
from you.

That's right.
That's right.

lt's workin', kid.

Thank you.
No, thank you.

Thank you so much, my friend.
<i>Y</i>ou helped me so much.
<i>Y</i>ou're entirely welcome.

Thank you.
Good, good.

They're unfeeling machines !

[ Screaming Fades ]

<i>Will you explain exactly</i>

<i>Y</i>ou said it yourself--
''l'm the only creature

Don't you remember ?
My God, that's not the answer.

[ Groaning ]

They don't feel
anything anyway.

who wants some
of the car dealer, huh ?

<i>Y</i>ou're not supposed to know the answer,

Mr. Hoover, you are

Sure !Just wind her up and
she'll say she loves you.

And she'll keep goin' until she gets
her own fried chicken franchise.

<i>Y</i>es, l said l loved you, but that

of hope, truth and success.

But you've become
a betrayer, Mr. Hoover. A fake.
