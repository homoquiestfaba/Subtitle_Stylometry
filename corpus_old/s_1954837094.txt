Specimen sacks in here.

If they're plastic
They might not
Been no good.

<I>Coroner:
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

<I> Yeah,

<I> It looks like

I don't think
it's pig.

Pacific units,

Utica road?

<I>Officer on radio:
This is county unit 20.
That's a roger.

<I> We passed utica
about a half mile back.

<I>Detective:

<I> We need you, honey.

<I>Female dispatch:
Do we know make or model
of said vehicle?  Over.

<I>Cop #2:
Still waiting on that
Information, two henry two.

<I> Stand by.

Where's the car,
Darling?

It's still on
the interstate.

I just passed
something big.

I, um--
Tanker truck

<I> Pulling
on the ramp.

Now, darling,
we need to know
it's destination.

<I> We've got to know
where he's taking her.

It's not like that.

I can't pick...

What I see
or feel.

( Sighs )

<I>Woman's voice:
He's driving.

<I> He has on
a button-front shirt.

He needs a shave.

<I> ( Girl whimpers )

<I>Woman's voice:
There's one girl tied
to the arm rest thing.

Tell us about
the car, darling.

The car...

The car is, um...

It's an automatic.

<I> The radio's broken.

It's one of those,
Uh...

Big-big cars that
they don't make
anymore.

( Groans )
Um...

( Sighs )

He's...

<I> He's low on gas.

He's gonna have
to pull over soon.

<I> He was gonna want
to pull over soon anyway

<I> 'Cause he's feeling
the urge.

( Groans )
That's what
he calls it.

The urge.

<I> The girl is certain
She's gonna die.

<I> She's praying.

In her mind
She's praying.

( Girl sobs )

<I> ( Siren wails )

They just passed
a sheriff's car
one lane over.

Pursuit units,
suspect just passed
a county car.

<I> ( Girl whimpers )
Don't.  Don't.

<I>Woman:
Oh, sweet jesus!

<I> What he wants
to do to her.

( Humming hymnal song )

( Humming )

Come on, darling,
what have you got
for us?

<I>Woman:
He's on a long dirt road,

Lined with lots
of trees.

( Groans )

He's stopped.

Woman:
He's untying her.

( Girl cries )

<I> He's taking her inside
some place big.

<I> it's a barn
or a shed

At the end
of the dirt road.

Oh, sweet god!

Get him.
Get him!

<I> ( Girl crying )

<I>Woman:
Stop him!  Stop him!

Stop him!

I think
They made it.

Officer:
Hold it!
Don't move!

( Sighs )

Freeze,
right there!

( Screams )
Oh, god!

What's happening,
Cayce?

( Sighs )

He's--
He's dead.

He's dead.
They got him.

And that girl...

Is--
She's all right.

<I>Male officer over radio:
We got him!

<I> We got the sucker!
He's deader than shit!

How's the girl?

<I> Shook up,
But otherwise okay.

<I> This is
D-david-three
requesting ambulance.

<I>- ( Siren wails )
( Sighs )

Man #1:
Yeah, hold on
for a second!

<I>Man #2:
Put some overheads there.
That'll fix that.

<I>Man #1:
I want to have that.
I've got shadows on there.

<I>Makeup woman:
Justin, sweetheart,

<I> Do something
about her hair, will you?

<I>- Okay, let's check.
Tv broadcast:
Or your money back.

Man #1:
Close in that
barn door a bit.

<I> ...incredibly close,
the second one even closer.

<I> and this recharger
will never need support

<I> Because the charger stand
keeps its conveniently charged.

<I> I've learned in 30 years
that helped me get ahead.

Now, I'm really
going for it.
Oh, thanks.

The inside story for anyone
who wants to get ahead.

Ten seconds,
everyone!

...That gives
you the advantage in
business and in life.

<I>- Producer: and cue logo.
( Theme music playing )

<I>Producer:
and ready,
camera one.

<I>- Camera one: ready.
Producer: cue one.

It's 22 minutes
past the hour.
and welcome back.

<I> She initially visited us
four years ago

<I> To talk about
her first book,
"Window onto madness."

Her account of while
still a student at
Leland college

In South Carolina
She reached into
the mind

of mass murderer
Leonard Scott Levy

<I> and led police to him
in an isolated barn,

<I> Just moments before
he could claim
his 11th victim.

Her second book,
"Murder driven"

Told of her
year long involvement

On the Dolf Millhauser
murder case.

and she's here
with us today
to talk about

her new book
"Split reflections."

<I> it's an account
of her harrowing
experience

<I> Last year on
The Dewelyn twins
kidnapping case.

Author, psychic,
Cayce Bridges.

<I>- Welcome.
It's a pleasure, colin.

First off,
Why don't you
refresh our memories

About your-your gift.

Well, the gift i have--
Uh, that I've been given

Is called psychometry.

When I come in
contact with an object

I begin to pick up
sensations from it

And impressions start
to form in my mind's eye.

The impressions usually
involve the person who last
touched or used the object.

Are you being bombarded
by these impressions
all the time?

Well, during the course
of an average day
I'll usually

Pick up several impressions
at random without trying to,

but i'm very much in control.

Do you know
what i'm thinking
right now?

No.

When you do decide
to zero in on someone

Do you instantly
know everything
about them?

Their name?
Their address?

Oh, i don't know,
I wish it were
that easy.

Unfortunately,
these impressions are
frustratingly random.

Much of what i get is

What one of the detectives
I worked with called
"Useless trivia."

<I>- How do you do it?
Producer: camera one...

I mean,
A gentle, young woman
like yourself,

How do you handle
dealing with kidnappers
and murderers?

Well, I don't
deal with them,
really,

Face to face.

I mean, I'm not there
packing a .38

When it comes
time to pick them up.

<I>Colin:
But in a lot of ways
you get a closer

<I> To these people
than the police ever do.

You actually never met
any of the people you
helped capture?

( Whistling )

Yes?

I wasn't adopted
actually until
I was eight.

You can imagine
how off-putting it was

To perspective
adoptive parents

To have this four
pr five year-old

Suddenly blurt out
some off the wall
piece of information

About a distant relative
of theirs.

I was finally adopted
by a wonderful couple

Who couldn't careless
about what i could do.

They were two people
with simply nothing to hide.

And they've since
passed away.

( Whistling )

The book is
"Split reflections,"
The author Cayce Bridges.

Thank you.
It's 27 minutes
past the hour.

We'll be right back.

How's it going,
kiddo?

Okay.
( Smooches )

I'm tired.
Me, too.

How do you think
it went?

I'm your manager.
I'm prejudiced.

But i just
got off the phone

With Raymond Tarr
Himself in New York.

He thinks that you
came off intelligent,
attractive, charming.

Well, at least i don't
really have to be
those things.

I can just come off
like i am.

and he's that
much hotter for
the three book deal.

He's coming into town
and wants to take us
to dinner

tomorrow night
to talk about it.

Did he mention
"Lamp light"?

Yeah, mentioned it.
Tarr loves it.

I told you that.

His fiction department
think they have the next
Ann Tyler on their hands.

But they still know
where their money is
with you.

But you made it
clear to them,
right?

I can't spend
the rest of my life
focusing in on killers.

Hey, i know how tough
these books are on you.

That's the beauty
of this deal.

All you have to do
is deliver one

psychic detection
Non-fiction to them
in the next ten months.

<I> After that,
the other two books in
the deal can be fiction.

They can be
whatever you want.

There's only
a handful of people
in the whole world

That can do
what you do.

None of them can
write about it like
you can.

You have this
miraculous power

to help people
in trouble.

You can't blame them
for wanting you
to use it.

All i want is
a normal life.

Is that so wrong?
One more.

That's all
they're asking for.

After that,
they'll publish
your fiction.

With the deal
I'm going to sow
Tarr into,

They'll publish
your laundry list
if you want.

<I> ( Alarm sounds )

I saw Mr. Cute talk show
host hitting on you on
the commercial breaks.

Anything there?

He's seeing someone.

Her name starts with a "C"
or maybe it's a "K."

She's pregnant.
She's gonna tell him
this afternoon.

It's a boy.

I picked up on it
when he handed me
that water glass.

Right.
Well, he's out.

What about the guy
in the green room
with the red hair?

I told you.
I'm not gonna get
interested in anyone

Till i can find
someone I can touch--
I know!

Without reading
their thoughts.

Have you ever met
anyone like that?
No.

But he's out there.
Oh, yeah?

Hey!
Sorry!

Not a problem.
It was my fault.

Where's Mar Vista?

South of here
near the airport.
Why?

You know,
Tarr's only going
to be in town a few days.

He's going to want
to take an answer
back with him.

I know.

It might be a once
in a lifetime offer.

Okay, okay, okay,
No more pressure.

You go home,
enjoy the new house

and give me a call
if you want to talk
about it later.

I'll be at my place
around 7:00.

Thanks for
everything.

You were great,
baby.

<I> ( car alarm chirps )

You all right?

Yeah.

I gotta
go back inside
for a second.

Did you forget
something?

Coming through,
people.

<I>Man:
All right,
stand by, everybody!

<I> ( alarm sounds )

You better come on in
If you're coming,
darling.

<I>- Man: here we go.
( Theme music playing )

<I>Tv host:
It's 12:00 noon
In Los Angeles.

<I> and this is
The KJAN TV action line
news midday report.

<I> Here are anchor persons
Martin Presco and Rebecca Karr.

Good afternoon,
Los Angeles.

Leading the top stories
at this hour is murder

in the community
of Mar Vista.

Our own Inez Villanueva
is at that location now.
Inez?

Inez:
Yes, Steve.
I'm standing on

the 800 block of
Loma drive in Mar Vista.

The body was discovered
at 11:45 last night
by neighbors.

<I> The victim Roger Kimmelman,
51 years-old,

Was a retired
postal worker.

Now, what has police
concerned at this time

Is some kind of
calling card

left by the suspect here
in the victim's apartment.

<I> According to sources
close to the investigation,

A similar calling card
was found at the scene
of another murder

<I> in the Silverlake area
just two days ago.

<I> ( phone ringing )

Will somebody out there
please pick up
five-five?

Roger Kimmelman's
blood type's
A positive.

You got it.

Yeah?

Detective Webber?

What can I do
for you?

Are you in charge of
the murder last night
in Mar Vista?

Uh-huh.
I think I can help you.

How?

My name is
Cayce Bridges.

I've worked with
the police before.

You're psychic?

That she is,
partner.

Captain Donner
just lassoed me in
the hall out there,

Filled me in
on Miss Bridge's
remarkable career,

Helping various
police agencies

With their toughest
serial killer cases.

Seems our captain is
something of a fan.

Asshole.

and we are to
gratefully avail
ourselves of her services

On this case,
commencing immediately.

Look, we don't have
time for this crap.

You sit over there,
take all the notes
you want to take,

Just stay out of our way,
do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

Whatever it is you're
trying to hustle I don't
want to hear it.

<I> the T.D.N. report
came in

<I> On those marks on
the living room carpet.
nothing conclusive.

Probably made by the victim
moving furniture around
the day before.

Holyfield--
He's coming up here with
the preliminary reports

Today at 4:30.

Your middle name
is Tiryn.

T-i-r-y-n.

It was your aunt
Irene's idea.

Your wife's
maiden name
is Taylor.

You met each other
in a record store
in college.

She worked there.

( Chuckles )

You have
a small spot

on your left
shirt sleeve.

Mustard.

You made a mental note
this morning not to take
off your jacket today.

There's absolutely
no doubt in your mind

That this murder
last night in Mar Vista

Is connected to that murder
a few days ago in
Silverlake.

<I> Someone called in the station
this morning and confessed.

Fitzgerald?

He's a crank
and you know it.

and a detective
named Manny

<I> has owed you $20
for three weeks

<I> and you're really
ticked off about it.

( Gasps )

That calling card--
The killer's calling card,

The one that you won't
even tell the news about,

It's something written.

An "F" and an "R."
"F.R."

"Fear."

"Fear" and another
short word.

I'm not getting it.

He's written it on
the wall by both of
the bodies that you found.

Blood...

He's written it
in blood.

<I> Who's blood?

It's not the victim's.

It's...

The other victim.

<I> He-- god,
he drained some of
the victim's blood

and saved it
until he kills again,

<I> and then he used it
to write fear something

On the wall
by the body.

He did it
to throw off
the police.

Uh, let's have
the lab check on it?

You had a cold
spaghetti sandwich

<I> and cherry coke
for breakfast
this morning.

And you don't
know it yet,

But the killer's
already done it
again.

Well?

It's definitely
this street.

An older woman.

They say there's only
one lady that lives on
this street by herself.

Her name is Mrs. Reardon.

She lives on
the next block.

He's been here.

<I> ( light chime music
playing on truck )

Wait!

He didn't use
this door.

He-he went in
another way.

Another door maybe,

Or a window.

He may not have,
but how about we
give it a try?

( Knocking )

Nobody's gonna answer.

( Knocking )

( Shouts )
Mrs. Reardon?

Liver frying.

Web.

No.

He didn't go beyond
this room.

Webber:
Jesus!

( Gasps )

( Gasps )

<I>Cayce:
Yeah, Jess, I left there
about an hour ago.

Uh-huh, the impressions
were unusually strong
this time.

Beats me.

Oh, they'll probably
going to want to know
my whereabouts

At the time of each
of the murders

So you should expect
a phone call, okay?

During the first one
I was out of town,

and during the second one
I was on television

So we should be out of
that one pretty quick.

Well, they want me to
go down to the house
again tomorrow.

Yeah.
I don't know.

Things were pretty
crazy there when I left.

This guy's
really bad news.

I hope they catch
him quick.

( Chuckles )

Yeah, i guess
I'm fully committed.

And, yes,
we can spring the news

On Mr. Tarr
tomorrow night.

Okay.

I will.

Good night.

( Beeps )

<I> ( classical piano playing )

Hi.
( Sighs )

( Whispers )
That goes there.

( Chuckles )

The body discovered
earlier tonight by police

<I> has been identified
as Agnes Reardon, age 73.

<I> Mrs. Reardon,
a widow, lived alone
in her Venice home.

<I> Because of the killer's
apparent ease at striking

<I> at often not so private
locations

or gaining entrance
to victim's homes

Without calling attention
to himself,

Department sources
say the police have
given him a nickname.

<I> They are calling him
"The shadow man."

<I> In a minute,
we'll be joining

<I> the action line
sports team live
from Hawaii

<I> where the winchell cup
victory celebration is
just getting underway.

<I> We'll be right back.

( Woman humming )

I see her.

<I>Cayce's voice:
Mrs. Reardon.

<I> She's very small,
fragile.

<I> She has an ache
in her right leg.

<I> It's arthritis,
I think.

Did anyone notify
her son yet?

He's a lieutenant
in the navy

<I> on a destroyer stationed
off the Aleutian Islands.

<I>Cayce:
There's someone there.

( Sighs )

Is it the killer?

Yes.

( Pants )

He has a very large
hunting knife

with a red plastic
handle.

He came this way
very fast.

He stopped here.

This is where
he grabbed her.

( Whimpers )

It's weird.

What?

( Whimpers )

<I>Cayce:
He put on
a stocking mask...

<I> after he had already
grabbed her,

after she had
already seen
his face.

Next, he pulled her
to the floor.

I can't-i can't go
in there.

Fear-- i'm picking up
terrific fear from
this woman.

She was absolutely
terrified.

Gloves-- he put on
surgical gloves

<I> and a stocking mask

Because he knew
this was the image

that would terrify
her the most.

It's her fear.

<I> Her fear, it's
very important to him.

<I> He's feeding it.
He's sustaining it.

It's almost
as if he knows
exactly what to do

To make her
that much more
afraid of him.

( Gasps )
Dear, god!

Concentrate
on him, Cayce.

Connect with him.
with him.

( Sobbing )

( Sighs )

What's the matter?

<I>Cayce:
I'm some place else.

Lady?

<I>Wu:
Hey, Miss Bridges!

Come on,
snap out of it!

Are you all right?

I think so.

What happened?

I don't know.

( Sighs ) Well,
I think i've given them
a couple of good leads

If they decide
to follow them.

They'll follow them.
They'll play dumb
at first

but they'll follow them.
they always do.

Are you okay?

Yeah, something kind
of weird happened
this morning

at that woman's house.

<I>- ( Bell rings )
Yeah, like what?

Whoa, uh,
we'll take
the next elevator.

I have this
childhood thing
about suffocation.

Bye.

Okay,
so what weird thing
happened to you?

I saw something.

It was a vision
only it wasn't like
any i've ever had before.

It was much brighter
and clearer than usual.

<I>- ( Bell rings )
And i saw someone.

It was a man.

It was like
he knew I was there.

He knew i was
watching him.

( Ringing )

Hello?

<I> ( Man speaking
In spanish )

I think you have
the wrong number.

No, in fact,
I know you do.

You have
the wrong number.

<I> ( Dial tone )

You're welcome.

( Ringing )

Hello.

<I> ( Man speaking
In spanish )

<I>You have
the wrong numero.

<I>- Comprende?
( Man speaking
In spanish )

<I>Man's voice:
Is that you?

<I>- Hello, who is this?
I'm trying to reach you.

<I> Are you listening?

What?

<I> Can you hear me?

Yes, i think your friend
has dialed the wrong
phone number.

<I> Cay-ce...

<I>Man's voice:
Cay-ce...

<I> It's okay to be scared,
Cayce.

<I> You should be.

<I> ( Piano playing
light classical music )

Waiter:
How is everything,
Mr. Tarr?

Oh, just fine,
Tommy.

My husband never brings
home galleys, my dear.

But yours he did.

He said,
"Listen, you've got
to read this."

Well, I went
in the den,

Sat down
and started to read

and I never moved
and inch

until I finished
the last page.

It was 4:00
in the morning!

After that
she threatened me with
grievous bodily injury

If I didn't bring home
the galleys to your next
two books.

The truth be told,
Los Angeles is not
my favorite town,

But when Ray said he was
coming out to see you,
Well...

And now I understand
you're working on
a new book.

Oh, Jessica filled
me in

On the details
this afternoon.

It, uh, sounds
very promising.

I suppose
I shouldn't
ask the subject.

No, you shouldn't,
my dear.

Well, at least i get
to read the galleys.
( Laughs )

Earlier you were
telling us how you
happened to meet Cayce.

Well, I was flying home
From an A.B.A. Convention
In Dallas,

<I> one where i signed
Allen Brenner.

<I> and the only flight
I could get back to...

( Silence )

( Gasps )

Excuse me.

Well, nothing
to worry about, Cayce.

Everything okay?
Yeah.

Are you sure? Okay.
Uh-huh.

I'll get you
another glass
right away.

So, during
the layover

I, uh, picked up
This Atlanta newspaper.

And there was a story
about a college girl
from South Carolina

<I> who had helped catch
this really horrendous
serial murderer

<I> that they had been
trying to find
for months.

( Silence )

( Gasps )

I'm sorry.

Cayce?

The other night
we went to the opening

Of the new
Jasper Jones' exhibit.

Have you seen it yet?
It's truly remarkable.

No, but I hear
It's quite a departure.

<I>Man's voice:
Cay-ce...

<I> Cay-ce...

<I> How are you tonight?

<I>- Hmm?
( Brakes squeak )

<I> I know who you are,
Cayce.

<I> and i really like
your books.

( Whimpers )

Cayce,
What's wrong?

<I> It was
a big surprise

<I> having you visit
my bedroom this morning.

( Door slams shut )

<I> Your energy is very...

<I> potent.

What is happening?

( Gasping )
It's him.

It's the killer!
It's the shadow man!
He's talking to me!

<I>Shadow man's voice:
This place is very
special to me.

<I> I come here often.

( Lights buzzing )

<I> I'm so happy
I finally have someone
to share it with.

He's, uh...
He's at a mall.

I think he's getting
ready to kill
somebody.

( Chuckles )
She's not serious,
Is she?

Which mall?
Where?

Listen, i swear.
I'm serious.

I bet.
All right, dude.

( Laughs )
You guys always
give me a bad time.

<I>Girl:
I know.

Do you recognize
any of the stores?

It's a service hallway
for employees.

<I>- Okay.
I don't see any...

<I>Shadow man's voice:
What do you think, Cayce?

<I>- Girl:  who's that?
Does she look good
to you?

Oh, god.
( Gasps )

<I> ( Shadow man pants )

<I> She's very nervous
walking here all alone.

<I> Are you picking
that up from her, too?

( Whimpers )
Yes.

Oh, god,
He's going
after her!

<I> ( Shadow man
breathing heavily )

( Exhales deeply )
( Shudders )

Oh, god!

<I>- ( Girl screams )
( Shadow man whistles )

<I> ( Girl whimpers )
No!

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Do you feel it?

Yes.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Feel it, Cayce.

<I> it's the fear.

<I> There's no other rush
like it in the world.

Towne hills!
It's the Towne hills
mall!

Okay, Cayce,
We know where
he is.

<I> You can break
away now.
Cayce!

<I>- Break away!
I can't!

( Screams )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Just where I want her.

<I> Where we want her,
Huh, Cayce?

<I>- ( Laughs )
Oh, no.

Oh, god, please!
No!

( Girl crying )

( Screams )

No!

( Screams )

No!

<I> The knife.
she's afraid
of the knife.

( Screams )
No!  No!

<I> It's like it's in some
scary movie she saw
last night.

God, no!

No!  Save me!

Help!
Let me out!

<I> ( Shadow man panting )

Don't!
Don't!

( Screams )

<I> Stay awake.
Stay awake.

<I> Fear me.
Don't faint!
Don't faint!

<I> Not yet!

( Gasping )

Cayce, let go!

<I> Don't worry about
the girl.

<I> She's only fainted.
Only fainted.

Do you want a drink?
sit down, baby.

That's a girl.

<I> Of course,
that don't mean

<I> I don't wanna.

<I> Cayce!

No!

Cayce, stop it!

Cayce!

( Panting )
It's okay.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Mmm, she was wonderful, Cayce.

<I> and so were you.

( Gasps )

( Telephone rings )

Cayce:
Look, if i'm right,

Then he probably knows
we're talking about him
right now.

He knows exactly
where to strike

And exactly when
to strike so that
no one can find him.

The others I was
tracking never knew.

This man knows.

I think he's psychic,
too.

And he's better at it
then I am.

<I> ( Rock music playing
in passing car )

( Pants )

Hey!

Hey!

Oh, hi.

Hi.
I need you.

Please, there's a killer
out there in one
of the cars.

Please, come on!
Please, hurry!

He's wearing
a baseball cap
and a black jacket.

He's out there
somewhere

In a car alone.

For god's sake,
Hurry.  Please!

( Sighs )

What the--
Sweetie!

Up that way!
Try up there!

Hey, back off!

Driver:
What are you
staring at, buddy?

( Shouts in russian )
Hi.

I'm really sorry.

Sorry.

Aren't you going
to radio it in?

He could still be
In the area.
Radio it in?

Yeah, you know,
you are a policeman.

No, i'm not.
I'm a fireman.

<I>Cayce:
Thanks for following
me home,

<I> and waiting till
I got all the lights on

And staying
A few minutes
while i change.

<I> Ignore the mess!

<I> I-- two days
after I signed
escrow

<I> I got yanked away on
a 26-day promotion tour.

Thanks,
I can use it.

I always wanted
to see the inside
of this house.

It's about ten times
bigger than mine.

So, uh, feel like
telling me what's
been going on?

What's wrong?

Well, on a...

Weirdness scale
of one to ten

It would probably
register an 18, so...

I'm really good
at solving other
people's problems.

My problems?
Forget about it.

Other people's
problems.

I'm a psychic.

I'm clairvoyant.

And yesterday
I started to work
with the police

on the shadow man case.

Do you know about that?

And i found out
that the reason
he's so good

At evading the police
is that he's psychic too.

And earlier tonight,

He took me along--
mentally took me
along,

While he...

You're gonna
read about it in
the paper tomorrow.

You don't
believe me, huh?

It's not that.

Look, i was
brought up on
a farm in Nebraska.

77 acres,
All of it
perfectly flat.

<I> Weren't many surprises
out there.

You tend to see
everything that's
coming at you

about ten minutes
before it arrives.

You keep both your feet
squarely planted on
the ground.

I just--
I don't know,
I have a hard time

with psychic stuff

and ufos,
you know?

A lot of people
have seen me do it.

Oh, sure.
I mean, really.

Anyway, um,
I'm right next door

If you need
anything.

Thanks...

For at least
trying tonight.

Listen, let me give
you my phone number
just in case.

Jack, i'm really not in
the mood to try and read
your mind tonight.

No, that's not it,
I just changed
my phone number

and I forgot it
for a second.

I got it.

It's your pen.

Yeah.

Well, bye.

Bye.

<I> ( phone ringing )

Hello?

<I>- ( static crackling )
Hello?

Who is this?

<I>Jess:
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

<I> Sam, get out of here!

<I> Sorry about that.

<I> The dog just went on
the bedroom carpet-- again.

<I> I just wanted
to make sure you were
all tucked in okay.

<I>- I'm fine.
Good.

<I> that was quite a scene
in the restaurant tonight.

<I> It's gonna make
a fantastic chapter
in the book.

<I> I don't think
The Tarrs expected

<I> to get quite so close
to the action.

<I> You know,
what about that?

<I> I wonder if you're
going to be able

<I> to use them as
characters in the book.

<I> Cayce?

I'm still here,
Jess.

<I> Are you sure
you're gonna be
all right there?

<I> By yourself?

<I> I don't like you
being there alone.

Yeah, I think so.

I have a friend.

He's my neighbor
next door

and he can help me
out if I need it.

He's a firemen.

<I> Oh, really?
and how long have
you known him?

Um, well, we just met
tonight.

<I> Now is he the older,
distinguished
captain-type?

( Chuckles )
No.

<I> Mmm, so he's
the young hero
calendar type.

<I> ( static crackling )

( Screams )
Oh, god!

Jack!

Jesus, help me,
please!

<I> ( rock music playing )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Hello, playmate.

<I> I wasn't sleepy
when I got home.

<I> I guess you weren't
either, huh?

Cayce!

Cayce!

<I> ( rock music playing )

<I> It's nice having
someone I can be with

<I> Who understands

<I> what i can do.

<I> I know what you'd like
more than anything.

<I>- ( knocking at door )
You'd like to see my face

<I> So you can describe it
to the police.

( Crying )
Oh, my god.

Hold me.
Help me.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Well, okay, here you go.

( Laughing )

( Screams )
No!

Cayce, it's me!
It's Jack!

It's okay.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Sweet dreams.
( Laughs )

Thanks for
the lift.

I'm going in
on the 72-hour shift,

But i don't have to.
There's nothing you
can do.

There's nothing
anybody can do.

I just have to stick
with the police until
they catch him.

Kill him.

Thanks.
Happy hunting.

These flags show the location
where the four murders
have taken place.

This area here is
central to all four.

And that's
a damn big area,

But we're thinking
that he could be
a hub killer.

Uh, someone who kills
around a certain fixed
place,

Like his home
or where he works.

We'd like to drive
you around this area.

Maybe you can
pick up something

From the surrounding
environment.

<I> ( Police dispatch
chattering )

Cayce?

Thanks.

Lake Tahoe's
really beautiful.

You're gonna be
happy there.

Lake Tahoe?
What are you
talking about?

Sergeant Wu's just
thinking about where
he's moving.

Wu, when did this happen?
what do you mean,
you're moving?

I turned in my notice
this morning.

I-I was gonna tell you
at dinner tonight with
the wives.

Sorry.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
How embarrassing, Cayce.

<I> I used to have trouble
letting things slip like that,

<I> but not anymore.

<I> In case,
somebody hasn't
told you, man.

I risked
my life with you.
We hang out.

Wait a minute.
I got him!
I got him!

<I>- ( Children yelling )
Yeah, you've got me,
all right.

<I>Cayce's voice:
He's on a residential
street on foot!

That's great, Cayce.
Any land marks
or street signs?

Just houses.

Um, not very big.

Nice and neat.

Nice and neat
residential homes,
That's not around here.

<I> Nice kids, huh?

<I> Well, time to go to work.

<I>Cayce:
He's at a back wall in the back
of one of the houses.

<I> He's just jumped over.

He's in
the backyard

<I> and he's moving
towards the house.

<I> ( Children yelling )

He's at
the side door.

He found the key.

It was in one of
those little fake rock
hide-a-key things.

He's going inside.

<I> He's in the kitchen.

There are kids' drawings
on the refrigerator.

<I> in the refrigerator
there's leftover pizza

<I> and a cup--
some kind of kid's cup.

He's going into
the living room.

<I> There's toys scattered
all over the floor, kids' toys.

<I> There's a baseball in
one of those plastic
display things

<I> on the coffee table.

I don't know
If there's anybody
home or not.

Can you see a tv?

Yeah.
Is there a trophy on it?
a football trophy?

Yeah.
He's in my house.

That son of a bitch is
In my house!

<I> The kids will be home
any minute.

( Humming tune )

( Tires screech )

<I> ( Police dispatch
chatter )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Whatever you do, Cayce,

<I> Don't look
to your right.

<I> I watched the two kids
go inside a couple of
minutes ago.

<I> they're very cute.

<I> You see now,
don't you?

<I> I can get to anyone.

<I> I want you to stay
away from the police

<I> or i'm gonna come back
for the perfect children,

<I> and the pretty wife
and the detective, too.

<I> Come on, Cayce,

<I> We don't need
anyone else.

<I> It's just you
and me

<I> and the fear.

This doesn't make
any sense.

Besides that,
the police are still
desperate to work with you.

I can't.
He'll kill Webber
and Webber's family.

I know he will.
Besides, there's
nothing the police can do.

He's always going
to be one step ahead
of them.

You can move in
with me.

We'll get bodyguards--
That's not it, don't
you understand?

He's not after me.
He likes me.

I give great fear.

I've already made
last call, miss.

I can't stay here.

I'm a part of what
he's doing now.

Maybe if i leave,
he'll slow down

Or slip up somehow,
I don't know.

All right,
I'll come with you.
No, i have to be alone!

Call me
and tell me
when you get there!

I'll be waiting!

( Sighs )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Where the hell do you
think you're going, Cayce?

<I> You can't leave me.

<I> ( Shadow man panting )

<I> Get off that plane,
Cayce, now!

<I> You're going
to New York, aren't you?

<I> Why, Cayce?

<I> Why are you
leaving me?

<I> Don't test me.

<I> I’m warning you.

<I> I’ll do anything
to stop you from going.

<I> Anything!

<I> (Shadow man
panting )

Excuse me, miss?

When do you
shut the door?

As soon as
everyone's on
board, ma'am.

And how soon
is that?

What?
Ten seconds?
20?  An hour?

Maybe a minute.

( Whispers )
Close the door.
Close the goddamn door.

<I>Passenger:
John.

Oh, hi.

( Sighs )

Oh, god.

Oh... Oh, no.

Take care
Of yourself,
Kiddo.

Stay safe.

Ma'am, please,
you must stay
In your seat.

You've got
to stop the plane!

Ma'am, please!
No, you've got to stop
the goddamn plane!

Somebody's about
to be killed!

( Shadow man whistling )

What do you mean?
Back there in
the terminal.

You've got to stop
the plane now.

Please, ma'am,
just calm down and tell
me what the problem is.

You have to let me
off this plane now!

The only way he won't
do it is if i get off
the plane now.

Who won't do what?

Let me off
this plane now

Or i will scream like
this all the way
to New York!

No!

No, I came back!

I came back!
You don't have
to do anything!

( Screams )
No!

( Muffled
cries )

No, no!
Please, don't!

( Screams )
Help!

Help!

Help!

Oh, please, no!

Help!

Not suffocation!
Jessica!

( Muffled cries )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
But that's greatest her fear.

<I> I know it is, Cayce.

<I> I read it
in your thoughts.

Why?  You didn't
have to do it!

I came back!

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Don't you ever try
and leave me again.

<I> If you you do I will
kill one person an hour,

<I> Every hour until
you come back to me.

<I> You know I can do it,
Cayce.

<I> and you know I will.

( Breathes deeply )

<I> That's my very
good girl.

<I>- ( Doorbell rings )
Cayce!

It's me,
Jack Hays!

<I> I just came off duty!

I didn't know
what you'd be
serving for breakfast,

So I brought
red and white.

Cayce:
The perfume came first.

There was a knock
at the door, I opened it

and that was
on the mat.

It's my scent.

Next, came the shoes.

They're identical
to a pair i ruined

Two weeks ago
in Houston.

And then this.

It was out there
this morning.

The police?

I can't.

You shouldn't be here either.
It's very dangerous for you.

He killed my friend
Jessica.

So if I leave
what are you going
to do?

Look, Cayce,
I've been a firemen
almost 11 years now.

<I> My first year
on the job
there was

This four-alarm
structure call
downtown,

<I> One of those creaky
old office buildings.

I was sent up
on the roof.

An entire section of it
collapsed underneath me

<I> and I fell 30 feet
to the interior floor.

I spent the next seven weeks
on my belly in UCLA medical.

But the minute
I got out of there,

I went downtown
and i found an older
office building

<I> and i went up on top
of that roof.

<I> I covered every inch
of it over and over again.

I knew that I had
to take charge of
the situation

<I> or i'd never be able
to do the job
right again.

Don't sit around here
waiting for this guy
to take charge of you.

Let's go after him.

Is this the one?

You recognize it?

He's been
all through here.

We may be here,

But i don't know
what i'm gonna be
able to do.

Do what you did
with all the others.

Track him.

( Sighs )
But he'll block me.

Look,
It's emotions
that get you

Into your "alpha beta
whatever" state,
right,

So that you can do
whatever it is you do.

Use them.

Wait a minute.

I never told you
emotions were how i--

You read my books.

One of them.
Which one?

Three of them.
There's only three.

Well, they were laying
around the station house.

One of the other guys had them,
So i flipped through them.
big deal.

( Shudders )
Oh, god.

He did it
in there.

( Breathes deeply )

Do you need
to go in there?
No.

Good.

Um, are you ready?

Calm down,
Cayce.

I need
a strong emotion.

I need an emotion
that's stronger
than the fear.

I don't know.
Fear is pretty strong,
Though.

Okay, let's not
talk about it.

Just talk to me.
Tell me about yourself.

Tell me about you
as a kid.

What?  Just your average
psychic kid's childhood.

Yeah.

Uh...

I remember once...

It was
a few days before
my fifth birthday.

I was still living with
my foster parents
at the time.

And suddenly,
I knew where
my real mother lived.

My biological mother.

So, the next day
I got on the bus.

I was five years old
and I got on the bus

And I rode to where
my real mother lived.

And I remember I walked
up the front steps

And I looked in
the screen door,

And there, inside,
was this...

beautiful woman,

With her hair
tied up in a scarf,
vacuuming.

I had seen

God knows
how many women,

Hoping that one
of them would take me
as their daughter.

And suddenly,
here she was...

my real mother.

And I knocked
on the door.

And when she came
and looked down at me

I thought she was
going to sweep me up
in her arms.

But she didn't know
who I was.

I knew,
But she didn't.

And I sensed
That she didn't
really want to know.

And so I just
looked at her

for the longest time.

And then
I walked away.

That was when
I learned

That not
everybody can do

what I can do.

( Sighs )

Cayce?

I'm getting
something.

What is it?
What?

It's...

Um, water.

Liquid moving very fast.
Is he there?

I don't know.

He's there.

Where?

I don't know.

God, i'm losing it!

No, you're not.
No, you're not
losing it.

Concentrate.
Now look at me.

We're gonna do this
and we're gonna do
It together.

<I> ( Washing machine
whirring )

I don't believe
this.

What is it?

<I>Cayce's voice:
He's at the laundry.

<I> The son of a bitch
Is doing his wash.

Does he know you're there?
Does he know you're
watching him?

I don't think so.
Good.  You're doing it.

You're blocking him out.
Keep concentrating.

We need the name
of the laundromat.
can you give me a name?

Cooperman's--
Cooperman's coin op laundry.

Yeah!

I'm gonna call
the cops!
No!

If he gets away
he's going to go after
Webber's family again.

What do you want to do?
We have to get a...

A license plate number,
Something that we can
give the police

Even if he gets away
from the laundry.

( Brakes screeching )

I got it!

Cooperman's coin op.
1411 Washington
Boulevard!

How're you doing?
( Sighs ) yeah.

What's he doing?

He's opening his mail
waiting for his clothes
to dry.

Ow!

Oh, god!
What?  What?

He knows.

Shadow man:
Cayce!

Goddamn it, Cayce!

What the hell do
you think you're doing?

What's happening?
He's tearing up
the place!

Just keep concentrating!
Don't lose him!

<I>Cayce:
He doesn't want
to leave his stuff.

He senses that the police
will be able to trace him.

( Chuckles )

And he's scared.

Shadow man:
You can't do this
to me, Cayce!

I'm in control,
Not you!

Get out of my head!

He's gonna
get away!

( Shadow man pants )

There it is!
Cooperman's!

He's in the back!
In the alley!

( Screams )
No!

Which way?
I don't know.

I lost him.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
You caught me off guard once,

<I> but you're not
going to be able
to do it again.

<I> I won't let you.

<I> You are only really safe
person in this whole city.

<I> Do you realize that, huh?

<I> I wouldn't have hurt you
for anything.

<I> Now, i'm going to
hurt you worst of all.

I'd say let's
call it a night,

But somehow
the idea of
going home

And waiting for him
to come and kill me
doesn't sound like fun.

Nobody drives
across town to do
their laundry, right?

So this guy lives
around here someplace.

You got something?

<I>Cayce:
Something.

<I> ( Television broadcast
echoing )

Oh, god!
It's him!

<I>Cayce:
He's in a house.

<I> it's his house,
I think.

Is it near here?
Do you know?

Who the hell are
you afraid of?

He's-he's outside now.

He just got
into his car.

What?  What?
What's he doing?

Nothing!
He's nothing!

He's cruising
and eating a candy bar!

( Shadow man breathing
heavily )

Jack.

He's right behind us.

No, he has a gun in
the glove compartment!

I saw it.

I was blocking him.
I know i was.

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Peek-a-boo.

<I> I see you.

Oh god,
he's coming!

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Mmm, what your boyfriend
wants to do to me.

He's reading
your thoughts.

What?

<I>- ( Carnival music playing )
Over there!

<I> ( Children screaming )

<I>Cayce:
He can't do anything to us
If there's people around.

Barker:
Get your drinks here, folks!

Dude, hey, you can't
leave it here!

Man:
Hey!

Are you the head of security?
I need to speak to the head
of security.

Slow down, friend.
Take it easy.

Cayce, where the hell
are you going?

I'm the only one
who can do it!

I'm the only one
who can stop him!

I--

<I> ( Distorted laughter )

( Shadow man whistling )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
I'm with you now, Cayce.

<I> Should I touch you
on the shoulder

<I> and introduce myself, hmm?

<I> Are you ready for that?

<I> ( Shadow man pants )

<I> You thought i wouldn't
like it here?

<I> Too many people.

<I> On the contrary,

<I> I love it here.

<I> ( Peoples screams echoing )

<I> ( Shadow man chuckles )

<I>Salesman:
Ice cream!

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Cayce.

<I> Where-where are you?

Come on,
You son of a bitch!

You go this way.
I'm going to cover here

And we'll meet
in the middle.

<I> ( Shadow man whistling )

( Whistling intensifies )

( Groans )

<I> ( Gears clicking )

<I> ( Distorted screams )

<I> ( Shadow man
Breathing heavily )

Hello, Cayce.

This is too perfect,
Cayce.

<I> Finally meeting you

Face to face to face...
( Chuckles )

Here in the chamber
of fear.

( Breathes deeply )

<I> ( Distorted screams )

You know, you're prettier
than in your pictures.

<I> Very, very pretty.

( Gasps )

You'll never pick out
The right one, Cayce!

( Laughs
maniacally )

<I> ( Laughs )

<I> Ow, that hurt!

( Coughs )

( Clears throat )

<I> Cayce?

Cayce,
what are you doing?

You knew we were
following you
tonight...

Not because you could
read my thoughts

But because you could
read Jack's.

Well, Jack ain't here
anymore.

( Groans )

( Bellows )

( Groans )

Cayce!

( Screams )

( Groans )

You stay away
from me!

I'm still
In control!

<I> ( Waltz music blares )

( Groans )

( Panting )

<I>Shadow man's voice:
Ah, too bad, Cayce.

<I> But don't worry,
You'll be seeing
me again sometime...

<I> Real soon.

Stop!  I want
to get off!

Operator:
I'll catch you
next time!

Oh, shit!

( Brake thuds )

( Cayce moans )

Jack:
Excuse me.

<I> ( Gears rattling )

( Ferris wheel
creaks )

( Screams )

<I> ( People scream )

( Whimpers )

( Shudders )
Cayce.

I'm gonna die
now.

( Screams )

<I> ( Police radio chatter )

<I>Female reporter:
Details are a little
sketchy at this time,

<I> but police sources
here at the scene say

<I> his name is
Jay Anthony Lapedes,

<I> a video store clerk who
lived in a rented house
in Culver City.

<I> No, Penny,
the police have not yet
released any information

<I> On why he was here
athe carnival

<I> or how they came
to know he was here.

<I> But i'm sure that
will all come to light
In the next few days.

<I> Back to you.

<I>Webber:
Just as long as you remember
to spell the name right.

<I>- Cayce: that's "T"
For Tiryn, right?
Webber: right.

Webber:
come on, partner.

( Laughs )

What?
You're funny.

I always said
I could never get
serious about a man

Till i could find
one that I could touch

Without reading
his thoughts.

Yeah, chinese food
sounds great to me, too.
