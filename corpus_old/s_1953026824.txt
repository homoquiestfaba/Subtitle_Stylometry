It is the dawn of the 17th Century.

After the assassination of his father
the young King Louis XIII

ascends to the French throne.

His once peaceful nation is surrounded
by enemies on all sides.

Within the borders of France itself
Cardinal Richelieu,

the King's adviser,

plots in secret to seize power for
himself.

The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

find themselves without a single friend.

Europe is a powder keg waiting to
explode

in a war that
will engulf the entire continent.

And only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse...

THE THREE MUSKETEERS

VENICE - ITALY

Halt!

Don't! Getting careless?

The feeling is mutual.

For future reference

I love you,
would have been a more suitable reply.

You could have just said hello.
What would be the fun in that?

How was the Bishop?

Not as good as you.
You are incorrigible.

I bet you say that to all the girls.

Lord!
Remember, I'm a lady.

Let me touch your breasts.
Lord, Keep your hands to yourself!

"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth."

"as it is in heaven."

"Give us this day, our daily bread"

"and forgive us our tresspass"

"as we forgive those who tresspass against us. Amen."

No more wine,
I'm telling you.

What?
Key.

You mean this key?

Who are you?

I'm not a priest.
I'm not really a lady.

I have ten minutes.

"There was once a partner and I."

"We have incredible torts to pay."

"She hadn't know, she have it, involving a chicken"

"a frog"

"and a rabbit..."

I expected more from a man
of your reputation.

Ah huh, oh!

I don't suppose you have any idea
where I could find Athos and Aramis.

Never heard of them.

You, French spies,
you're very very arrogant. And foolish.

And you're so...
Sexy.

It's a wonder it took me so long to
catch you.

Ahh, You didn't.
I Beg your Pardon?

You didn't... catch me.

And what exactly are you doing
here?

Catching you.


Key.

Vive la France.

The CRYPT OF DA VINCI.

The Vinci's vault

Leonardo designed it to protect the plan of
his greatest inventions.

Shall we?

Now.

Your part's done! Won't you stay back in to the rally point.

We came together, we leave together.

I'll go.
Wait, wait.

Too easy.

Pressure plates
under the floor.

I can scare the walls.
Run a cable along the roof.

It could be booby trap too.

Well?
We don't have all night.

Are you absolutely certain there are no hidden
passages? And no secret tunnels?

Positive, sir. It's a vault.

One way in. One way out.

Excellent! I want these
Musketeers dead. I want them dead!

The guards change
in 2 minutes. Maybe less.

Less!

What now,
"C'est la vie."?

No.

Contingency plan.

Got it.

Athos, you do know what's
up there?

Yes, hold your breath!

Hey, hey! Get back down there!
Now!

Do exhale!
I love you.

I hate to ruin the mood

but perhaps we can go elsewhere.

I think the first time
Father is right.

All for one.
One for all.

So what's next?

Back to Paris, I guess.
And then what?

Wherever they send us. Whatever
France needs.

It's who we are. It's what we do.

I do love you.

I know.

Then please try to understand. This
isn't personal.

It's ... strictly
business.

He made me a better offer

Ah Athos!

Buckingham.

A toxin.

In case you are wondering,
it wasn't in your drink.

It was on
your cup.

Inactive until it came in
contact with the liquid.

Don't worry.
It isn't fatal.

Although
I suspect part of you wishes it was.

You take all the risk and I get the
reward.

Hardly seems fair.

Just so you don't leave empty handed,
a word of advice.

Trust no one.
Especially women.

You'll live longer.

Telling him you loved him right
before you betrayed him.

I must say, that was cruel,
even by my standards.

I only took away his prize.

You... took a lot more than that.

At last, the war machine.

ONE YEAR LATER

Look down.

It's a trick that an old
friend taught me.

Your opponent will not always be
as noble as you.

Remember that, and I have nothing left to teach you.

I doubt that, Father.

Ah, keep it.

It's passed down from generation to generation,
from father to son.

It's yours now.

The weapon of a musketeer.

The real weapon of a musketeer,
is here.

All for one.

And one for all.

You remind me of somebody.

Let me guess.
You...

No, no. The man I wish I was
when I was your age.

Well, you should really be on your way.

Take this purse.
There's 15 crowns in it.

It's enough to get
you to Paris.

And you'll need a mount.

Your mother is insisting that
you take Buttercup.

I know it's not much, and...
It's plenty.

Take care of yourself, my son. Try
not to get into any fights.

If I'm to be a Musketeer, I think I
might have to do a little bit of fighting.

Well, stay at the back if you can.
Yes, mother.

Just one more piece of advice.

I know, I know.
Don't get in any trouble.

Wrong!
Get into trouble.

Make mistakes.

Fight, love, live.

And remember, always. You're a
Gascon. And our son.

Now, go!
Go!

AFTER 3 DAYS

In the name of God, what kind of
beast is that?

And the beast that he is riding
doesn't have much a deal.

Ostler!

See that my horse is
watered and fed!

Oh it's a horse, is it?

My friends here thought
it was a cow.

Excuse me.

See, I know you men are just kidding
around.

Buttercup... well, she gets a little sensitive.

I'm afraid I
must ask you to apologize.

Well I'm afraid, I'm not in the habit of apologizing
to Gascon yokels.

Not to me.
To my horse.

You've hurt her feelings.

And if I don't?

I shall have to kill you.

You shot me!

Most observant of you, young man.

But the real question is:
Why are you not dead?

Flesh wound.
The sight must be odd.

Who takes care of my business?

Ah Captain Rochefort, I...

Don't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

So, boy.
Consider it as a lesson.

His last...

No.

He's too pretty for that.

As you wish... Milady.

Rochefort, come.
We are expecting Paris.

Thank you.

Make way!

Ohh you had enough.

Where's my mug?

Excuse me!

You think you're better than me?
No.

All for one.
Excuse me.

Sorry, I'm sorry!
Are you blind?

Look, I'm chasing after a man who insulted
my horse and

tried to kill me!
So let me go.

That's not good enough. Spoke my
drink, ruined my shirt.

I am in a hurry.

Ah here, 10 suite.

Who do you think you're talking to?

The town drunk,
by smell of you.

And that my boy is a fighting to.

What are you saying exactly?
Blind and deaf.

Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

Great! When can you fit me in?

2 o'clock, Cooper's Yard,
St. Germain.

I'll be there.

Excuse me.

I just can't decide.

Well, if I might point out, this
does make you look very dignified.

Whereas the blue one brings out
your dashing side.

Equally important.

Dignified. Dashing.

In the words
of King Solomon: I'll take both!

A most excellent choice, sir!

Darling, you spoil me.
I don't know how will I ever repay you?

Watch yourself!

My apologies! Matter of life and
death! Won't happen again!

I believe you dropped this.
This isn't mine

I saw the lady hands it to you,
I'm not blind.

Are you implying that I take
money from this woman?

Are you saying that I cannot
afford to pay for my own wardrobe?

Do you know who I am?

Do you know who I am?
No.

Then we're even.

You're in luck, boy.

Ordinarily, I
would slaughter you on the spot

but this is a brand new jacket.

Cooper's Yard,
St. Germain, 1 o'clock.

I suggest you dress for a funeral.

What?!

What the hell?!

Five francs?!

Hey! Hey! What is this?!
It's a citation.

It's a ticket.

Failure to remove animal
bowel movements from public area.

French?

Your horse to the dumped on the street.

You're joking!

It's what they all say.

You know what?

Cooper's Yard,
St. Germain, 2 o'clock.

Strange boy.

Milady de Winter!

A close game, your Eminence.

Hmm!
Who's the opponent?

Myself.

No one else proved to
be a sufficient challenge.

Hmm, what news of England?

He's coming.

Buckingham?

hmm, and?...

and?

He built it.

The war machine.

And he doesn't question
your loyalty?

He thinks he's so cunning.

so evil.

Evil is just a point of view.

Ah, Richelieu.

This lady is the messenger
England?

Your Majesty is
exceptionally alert.

So, ah Madame.

War at Buckingham?

Majesty?

What's he wearing these days?

Green, Your Majesty.

Green?

Very interesting.

And you have the goal to recommend blue?

Of course it should be green.

Why am
I surrounded by incompetent idiots?

Green, green, green! Do I have to do it everyday myself...

Ah there you are.
Shall we get to it?

So are you eager to meet your maker?

I have other appointments.
You'll miss them, I'm afraid.

Ah, I'll try my best to be on time.

My seconds.

You.

You'll fighting this rascal?

My appointments. One o'clock. Two o'clock.

How long have you been in Paris?

Arrived this morning.
You have been busy.

Patience is not one of my virtues

Well neither of good manners.

Wait for your turn, old man.

What would you like me to put in your headstone?
Little shit?

D'Artagnan.

I'm Athos. This is Porthos and Aramis.

The Three Musketeers.

I've heard of you.

From my father, a Musketeer himself.

In fact,
I came to Paris to be one of you.

I'm afraid you're a little late.
What happened?

Ohh Bad mission. Budget cuts.

The Cardinal. Progress. Take your pick.

Well, welcome to Paris.

Pity we'll have to kill you.

Well, if I can't become a Musketeer,
I might as well fight one.

Or three!

Kill him already. It's lunchtime
and I'm starving.

Halt!

Ahh Jussac!

Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.

Duelling in defiance of the edicts?

You got tired of rolling
peddlers for spare change?

Now, surrender your
weapons and come along with us.

Surround it!

Unless, of course, you'd rather resist.

New plan.

Kill the boy, kick their
asses, and then go get some lunch.

I can do them as an exercise.

You were saying?

On the other hand, discretion is
the better part of valor.

You are the musketeers.
Wrong.

We were the musketeers,
now we're just... us.

Rochefort.

Shall we?

Finish them off.

Let's even the odds.

Enjoying the show?

You!
Watch out!

You didn't answer my question.

Are you always this cocky?
Only on Tuesdays.

And whenever
beautiful women are involved.

Damn you!

Can't you see we're trying to have a
conversation?

What is your name?

Constance.

Constance... sounds very steadfast.

A quality you seem to know little
about.

Oh I beg to differ.

Deep down behind me, a hopeless romantic.

Beg for more?

I forgot what
it feels like.

We all have.

The name is D'Artagnan.

You must come from
a very small town.

How did you know?

Lines like yours might actually work
there. This is Paris.

I suggest you stick to swordplay.

In the battle of
wits you, Sir, are unarmed.

She's right lad.

The ladies of Paris
are infinitely more complicated.

They have a thousand ways of saying no,

and only some of them mean yes.

I hate to ruin the mood,
but they will be back.

And unless you wish to
fight the entire army.

Elsewhere.

So now, what?

Do we pick up
where we left off?

I think there's been enough
fighting for one day.

Besides, any man who is an enemy of Rochefort

is a friend of mine!
Who's Rochefort?

Captain of the Cardinal's Guards.

The right hand of the most powerful man
in France.

Rochefort, is the most feared swordsman in Europe.

You certainly know how to
pick your fights.

Like I said, he insulted my horse.

You're reckless,
arrogant, impetuous

and probably be dead by sundown.
But I like you lad.

Where are you staying?
No idea.

Ah, do you have any money?

Well, good sir,
you and your fine stead

are welcome
in our humble home.

For the time being.

Fine... He's in there.

Come on.

What should we drink to?

How about the King?
He's a child.

The Cardinal rules, all but in name.
We might as well drink to him.

To France.

We served it. Fought for it. Bled
for it. Look where it got us.

Friendship, Love.

Word of advice, boy. Trust no one.

There must be something you still
believe in.

This...

This...

And this.

Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a
fool or trying to sell you something.

I know Athos may seem cold and
unfriendly, but don't let it fool you.

Deep down...
He really is cold and unfriendly.

What happened to him?

What happens to any man? A woman.

You know, I do not want to offend anyway,

but I thought you were
a little bit more...

Heroic.

What my esteemed colleague was trying
to say in his own way

is that we are... obsolete.

We are warriors,
but there's no war for us to fight.

So we
drink and brawl

and quarrel with
Cardinal's Guards and then we drink some more.

What we need is a great cause,

but there are no great causes left.

Which is why I keep telling you it's not too late

to do that priest thing again.

Beats working for the city.

Free booze at wakes and weddings.
And then, there's the nuns...

You were a priest?
Until I realized

being a man of God
and being a man of the cloth

aren't always the same thing.

And yet, he still says prayers for those
he kills.

Old habit.

On the contrary. The men I kill deserve
to die.

But they also deserve peace.

After all, they must have believed in
something.

We all do. Even the worst of us.

I'll drink to that.

Planchet!
More wine!

Planchet!

Sorry Sirs,
I'm afraid there's none left.

You've drunk a lot.

What sort of answer's that?

Go get some more, man!

Very good sir.
It's just... I can't sir...

We've...
we've ran out of money.

Planchet, what are you?

Completes a lot of waste of space sir.
And?

As much as use as a fart in a bottle, sir.
Right.

In short sir, a total tits sir.
But I can't work bleedy miracles.

Planchet.

Ohh..ohh..

Thank you very much, sir.
That's, that's incredibly generous

for such a handsome, young man.
Thank you very very much.

Will you, will you be staying here tonight?

He'll be taking your bed Planchet.

Ugh, right, so I'll be sleeping...
You may take the balcony.

Outside? On the balcony outside,
in the cold?

With birds shitting
on my head all night?

Great! Uhm
Can I just say...

Wine, wine, wine, wine
Yes, of course.

Wine as he says.
Wine, wine, wine, wine

Check.

This is a ridiculous game.

Surely the King should be the most
powerful piece?

The King is the most important piece,
but he's vulnerable.

He needs protection.

May I suggest you castle him?

Checkmate.

There! What do you think about?

Your Majesty is a force of nature.

Took you by surprise, eh?
Yes, Indeed, you did.

May we
speak a little about foreign policy?

It's not about Buckingham, is it?

I'm afraid it is. He's arriving in Paris
tomorrow.

His master, King James, has
agreed to hear our

peace proposal.
Good, good.

It's better
than to mess with me then!

There's also another matter.

A dangerous rivalry has sprung between your Majesty's
Musketeers and my personal Guards.

Who was involved?
Athos, Porthos and Aramis.

The usual suspects.

And a young man called D'Artagnan.

I have summoned them to the palace
so that your majesty can punish them severely.

His Majesty, the King

Well, well, well.

Brawling with the
Cardinal's Guards.

That's very bad,

What
have you got to say for yourselves?

We..
Humbly beg your pardon, your Majesty.

Yes, yes, I should hope so too.

So tell me, how
many were involved in the altercation?

There were 4 of us against 40 of them, your Majesty

4 is to 40?

And you beat
them like a drum?!

And yes, you shall have to be reprimanded, of
course. Most harshly,

I'm afraid. You understand that, don't you?
We do, your Majesty.

Your Majesty: the Queen.

Anne.

What a pleasant surprise.

My ladies and I wanted to see the
valiant Musketeers

who stood against
Cardinal's Guards.

Four against
forty. Or was it four hundred?

Just forty, your Majesty.
It was an off day.

That's my Musketeers for you!

By the time they write songs about
them, it'll be four thousand!

I hope you won't be too harsh with
them.

After all, boys will be boys.

You must be D'Artagnan.

My lady in waiting has told me about how
brave and dashing you are, yesterday.

But you must try not to be
so reckless.

Can't help myself, your Majesty.

Your Majesty, the culprits...
Ah, yes, yes.

Ahm..

Stand up, then.

Athos.

Porthos.

Aramis.

Forgive me for saying this D'Artagnan, but uhm, it looked you're
little undressed.

My father is a poor man, your
Majesty.

A former Musketeer as well.

These are the only clothes I have.

My Lord.
We must not rectify that.

Can't have my Musketeers or a son of one,
looking like tramps.

New suits all
round! I think..

Yes, you'll see to that, Cardinal?

And a yes, I think a purse of gold for each as
a reward for your courage.

You'll see
to that as well, Cardinal?

Oh, yes before I forget, no more
fighting with his Eminence's Guards, hm?

or there will be none of them left!

Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

but I doubt the King requires your advice in
this matter.

After all, they are his
Musketeers.

Good day, gentlemen.

Well now, off with you, rascals.

But be there for the parade tomorrow.
With new suits on.

I'm tired of this world, children.

It's time to make our move.

We shall use Buckingham as a rival to our advantage.

During his visit, we we'll reveal

that he arranged a secret rendezvouz with the queen.

May I inquire how your
Eminence has uncovered the scandalous affair?

By reading Buckingham's letters to
the Queen. Found in her possession.

Written in Buckingham's hand

and authenticated by his seal?

A woman of your talents should have
no trouble procuring either.

Your Eminence is too kind.

However, I doubt that the King will accept
such letters

as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

Then we shall provide him with
something a bit more... substantial.

A piece of the queen's jewelry given to
Buckingham as a token of affection.

Buckingham will be humiliated.

The King will be outraged.
The Queen will be executed.

France will have no
choice but to go to war.

And in times like these

prince will naturally turn
to a stronger leader.

Someone better equipped to rule the nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

Hhm!

Someone like your Eminence.

Turn around!

Where is he, then?
He's just a pole in manners.

Damn his impudence!

What is that
thing called anyway, Richelieu?

An airship, your Majesty.

Why don't I have one of those?
An oversight on our part.

Right, right. Well, build me one.

(Tie the strings)

Buckingham.

Blue.

Your Majesty.

Love the outfit.

Very... retro. We were all wearing
those in London.

When was it?
Last year? or the year before.

Lord Buckingham. I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

Not at all.
No, on the contrary.

Handles like a dream and
keeps me one step closer to heaven.

Cardinal.

Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

The King James is most

eager to hear your peace proposal.

Lord Buckingham.
Anne.

Your Majesty.

I must say your beauty is

far more radiant than I remember.

You've met before?
A long time ago.

An evening I shall cherish, forever.

Right.
Well, Shall we?

Now, this is a pleasant surprise.
Hm, another acquaintance of yours, I see.

We've met, yes.

As I recall, last I saw you, you
were on your knees as well.

Most unfortunate habit.

That habit I shall have to break during our
next encounter.

I look forward to it.

In the meantime,
Shall we talk peace?

You must pass me the name of your
interior decorator.

Wine?
I don't drink.

What about the nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left hand drawer.

You must pass me the name of your
spy in the palace.

And yours in mine.

England cannot afford
a war on two fronts.

Both our
nations have stretch to breaking point.

A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

Whose advantage
Yours.
Ours.

I have a feeling my new war machines
may address the balance.

Very impressive.

Stay where you are!
This is the Queen's wing.

You can't be up here.
Oh, thank goodness.

I got so lost. I took the wrong turn
and the door slammed behind me.

Oh, I've been trapped up here,
in the sun's heat.

It's going to be alright.
I'm gonna faint.

You're in safe hands.
Oh, thank you.

You can't shoot. They'll hear you.

Ssshh..

Constance! Constance!
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

Pardon, Your Majesty.
This only will take a moment.

What are you doing here?

His Majesty wants to have a word with me.
Imagine that.

Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

I- I was...

I was thinking, after I'm finished with His Majesty
maybe, we could talk?

I can't. I have plans.

How about tomorrow?

I have another plans.

Well, I...
Look, D'Artagnan.

You may have a new sets of clothes
and the King's favor

but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

Now, excuse me.

Two summons in two days?
Your Majesty's all of me.

No, cut that!
Please think about it.

You're a good fellow,
D'Artagnan.

So, ah how are the ladies
treating these days?

I can't complain.
Yes, indeed.

Well, same here, of course.
The thing is...

I got this... friend.

Just a regular child,
like you and me.

He got married very young.

Political alliance,
arranged marriage.

You know, the sort of thing.

Hardly knew the girl.
But he likes her?

Oh, ah yes, hhm hhm. Very much!

Well, does she like him?

Well, it's funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

He's uhm. He's not sure.

He just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

He's always saying the wrong thing.
Palm sweating.

The heart's pumping so loud.
He's afraid, she might hear it.

It's torture just to look at.

Have you ever felt this way?
Not until recently.

So- so...
What do we do?

I mean, my friend.
What is he do?

He should speak his heart.

Being someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

Being himself.

Oh that's what I told him.

Then he's definitely lucky.

After all, he does have
You Majesty as a friend.

Yes, yes.

It's good to have friends.

Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

(I don't believe it.)

How are you?

Very well.

I'm wearing blue.

And you're very handsome on those.

Thank you. Yes,
and you're looking very lovely.

In fact, I was talking
to D'Artagnan...

How beautiful you are.

Thank you, my Lord.

How did it go?
Clock work.

Good!

You'll go back to London with
Buckingham. And the diamonds.

And what should I do with them?

Put them in his personal vault.

The most
secure location in all of England.

The Tower of London.
Yep.

When the scandal breaks, he'll deny
everything.

But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

and what about the future of France?

I am France.

One last thing.

I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting

for a double agent to play both sides.

Have I given your Eminense any reason to doubt
my loyalty?

Spare me the rhetoric.

I know who you are.
I know what you are.

You have a gift for
corruption and a penchant for betrayal.

I admire such skills.

But I'll destroy you
the moment I suspect

you might be using them against me.

Do we understand one another?

There... is another side to that coin.

It's quiet easy for an employer to severe
all ties with his operative

in the event they are compromised,

leaving them to rot in jail or on the gallows.

Your point being?

I require a guarantee that I shall
not suffer a similar fate.

An insurance policy, if you will.

My word should suffice.

I'm afraid I need something a bit
more...

substantial.

It is by my order and for the good of
the State that

the bearer of this has
done what has been done.

Satisfied?

Immensely.

Your Majesty.

Purple.

Fashion favors the bold.

Here.
Try this for size.

However, do my regards
to the Queen.

I will convey your diplomatic proposal to
King James immediately.

Cardinal Richelieu,
a pleasure.

All mine.

Your Eminence.

Richelieu, Richelieu.

There has been a most
distressing development!

Certain letters, love letters,

were discovered
in a Queen's possession.

Letters from him. Buckingham,
of course. Who else?

Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

No, of course, I haven't.

They will just deny the whole thing.

I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

Is there any mention of a
specific encounter?

A detail?

A token of affection, perhaps?

Yes!
Yes there is.

A necklace.

The one I gave her for
our anniversary! Here!

"I shall always cherish the 12 studded
diamonds you gave me."

"The proof of our consummated love."

Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

Yes, I'm afraid it does.

Oh, my God!

All your
Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

What?
How would that help?

It would give you, Majesty, a pretext to

suggest to the Queen that she wear your gift.

Oh, Richelieu. That's very clever.

So if she has the diamonds?

Then your Majesty can rest easy.

And if she doesn't?

He wants to have a celebration
ball, five days from now.

Send my diamonds to the jewelers to be
polished.

I want the King's...
undivided attention that evening.

I hope I am not interrupting.

Hardly, your Majesty. To what do I-?

I know.

Perhaps your Majesty would care to be a bit more specific?

I know.

Yeah, I assume this is the part where I'm
supposed to laugh maniacally

and regale your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

However, I
regret to inform your Majesty

that I have no idea
what you're talking about.

I thought you would say that.

Then, why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

To look into your eyes when you
said it.

Your Majesty.

All may not be lost yet.

Coming, coming! Hold your horses!

It's not like it's a matter of life
and death, you know!

Actually, it is.

You want me
to go to England. Retrieve the diamonds

which the Queen suspects
might be in Buckingham's possession.

Which will naturally involve breaking into some
heavily fortified and highly impregnable facility.

The Tower Of London.

Since the Cardinal's spies are
trying to implicate the Duke,

it is the most logical choice.

Then return
to Paris, with every soldier, assassin,

mercenary and bounty hunter on both
sides of the Channel out to stop me from doing so.

Did I miss anything?

All in five days

a minor detail.
Anything else?

No.

Well, I really have only one question for you.

Why in the world would I do that?

England it is.

Diamonds, Buckingham
Tower of London, 5 days,

the Queen's reputation and the fate
of France as we know it.

Who's with me?

I should imagine the Queen
would be quite generous.

Count Porthos.

Hm? What is it? That has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?

Besides, I hear the English women are lot like
a frozen ball of champagne.

Ice on the outside.
But once you warm them up...

This isn't a great cause. But, it'll
have to do.

Buckingham's there, so is she.

Who?

Countess de Winter. Charlotte Backson.
Anne de Breuil.

Lady Clarick.

Milady.

Milady.

I know her.
I saw her with Rochefort.

She switched sides again.

Working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

What are you gonna do if you catch her?

(Musketeers, Open up!
And surrender by order of the Cardinal!)

You were followed.
It's Rochefort.

Athos, Porthos, Aramis
and D'Artagnan.

Surrender your weapons and no harm will come to you.

The moment they step out,
kill them!

Light the torches!

I'll count to 5 and then we will burn you out.

1!

2!

3!

Oh, sorry, didn't see you there.
Damn you!
Haha!

Let me guess. You've come to tell
me that the Musketeers are dead?

our
plan is proceeding on schedule,

and I have absolutely positively
nothing to worry about.

We were taken by surprise
Your Eminence.

Somehow I was laboring under the
assumption that

the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

Was it not?

Your Eminence...
Yes, you are quite fond of that word, aren't you?

Sadly repeating it does not
get you into my good graces.

Alert Milady.
Watch the ports.

No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

Post a bounty on their
heads.

The bigger, the better.

Yes, Your Eminence.

Rochefort...

Do not fail me again.

PORT OF CALAIS.

Jussac, and a lot of help,
has no way to get past them.

How the hell that they get
there so fast?

Now, what?
We need a distraction.

I'll go.
I'll go.

I could go.

Probably not.

Wrong.
Wrong on all counts.

You'll need every sword
where you're going.

I can't help you there
but I can help.

Right here. Right now.

If they catch you.
They won't!

If they catch you!
I'm the Queen's lady in waiting.

You, on the other hand, are
wanted fugitive,

and about to steal from
the most powerful man in England.

Which one of us should be worried?

Go! Go so that you can come back.

Now give me that hat!

D'Artagnan!

Behind him!

Wait!

The diamonds will be in Buckingham's
personal vault.

It's located on the lowest, most secure
level of the Tower, next to the Crown Jewels.

The lock is state of the art.

Requires a key that Buckingham carries
on his person at all times.

The corridor leading up to its booby traps

That's straightforward.
Does anyone want some bread and cheese? If you...

You haven't finished the brief, aren't you?

I'm so sorry.
Please don't tell me.

When it gets worse. A
lot worse.

We have to cross 3 stoned walls
to the moat.

Then it's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

with a predilection for not being robbed

although since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we are coming,

thanks to Milady,
that number is likely to be greater

And why can't we just tell Buckingham
Milady is plotting against him?

Because he won't believe us.

Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

Besides, Milady would have made sure.

Athos is coming.

Tell me what do you suppose
his after?

What does it matter?

Whatever it is,
it's merely an excuse.

He wants revenge for
Venice.

He wants me. And he wants you.

We shall have to be ready for him.

Want me?

We can't outshoot them. But we can
outsmart them.

He'll naturally favor misdirection and
deception.

He knows we're expecting
him. But that just ups the ante.

She knows us,
know how we look like.

How we move and how we think.

He'll divide his forces. Independent
teams,

each with their own point of
entry to maximize their chances.

There are four of us, so we use...
There are 5 of us, actually. If you...

He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route to the trader's gate.

Aramis will undoubtedly rely on
agility and stealth.

Check every tower,
every rooftop.

Porthos, on the other hand, will
employ brute strength.

One of his preferred method is getting
captured by the opposition.

All the more
reason to take none of them alive.

One more thing.

He may try and
drive a wedge between us.

Claim to have secret information

about some
plot to get us to turn against one another.

Like, say, that I'm a double
agent working for the Cardinal.

Or that you are looking to get rid of me.

I assure you, nothing could be
further from the truth.

Although

I suppose I should

search you for concealed weapons.

That's how it's done.

And that's exactly what she'll expect.

So we do the unexpected.

We go in Broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

With all the extra security, there'll be a
lot of new faces. That's their weakness.

And you D'Artagnan. You're the wild card.

We are the decoys.

Now, we'll try and create a distraction,

keep them occupied, keep them away
from you as much as possible.

But ultimately,
it's up to you.

You wanted to be a Musketeer.

You wanted to serve France. This is
your chance.

I saw your signal.

I saw you waving like an idiot.

Well, that was not the bloody signal.

I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

but unfortunately, I can't
get my head that far up my ass.

Are you serious?
Yes!

All right, that's enough of that!

Sergeant, I want you to arrest this man!
Arrest me?

Sir, the first
of the Musketeers has been arrested.

The game is afoot.

Bring him to me
and double the guards.

Double the troops.
Double everything.

Sir!

They'll come to us.

Well then, I think your Lordship
has everything under control.

You won't mind if I don't stay to
see how it all turns out?

Do you think I might lose?
On the contrary!

I have no issues
with you killing Athos but

if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

Tell me.

What's your favorite color?

Red.

Why?

I wanted to see if you're capable
of telling the truth.

As far from here as possible.

Well, well, well...

Look what the cat
dragged in.

So. How's the old Athos, eh?

Still his surly, insufferable self, I'm sure.

Sending a boy to do a man's job.

I should feel insulted.

What were you after anyway?

Secrets. Spies.
It's all a game really.

Although the price of loss, as you'll come to
discover, is a bit higher.

What?

No last words? No need?

Insults? please
for mercy or...

What time is it?

About 2 o'clock.

I have to say, why? Are you in a hurry?

Look out of the window.

They weren't the decoys. I was.

Permission to come aboard.
Granted.

Athos!

The wonderful thing about fighting an
imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

Your Eminence.

The pride of
victory without the risk of loss.

I trust you didn't come here to
impress me with your swordsmanship.

No, Your Eminence.

I have some good news.

Such as...?

So, what about the diamonds?

Doesn't Buckingham still have them?
No.

Milady likes hedging her bets.

She'd never take the chance that we would
succeed in breaking into the vault.

So where are they now?

With the only person
she trusts.

Which means we've lost.
And all this has been for nothing.

Ohh, I wouldn't say that.

You were the decoy. We were the
extraction. But the real linchpin of the plan.

Well..

That was
someone else entirely.

Someone even
Milady would never suspect.

Driver, what the hell
is going on?

Just following your instructions,
Ma'am.

As far away from here as
possible.

Planchet, I never thought
I would say this, but

Welldone!

Thank you, sir.

That really means a lot, especially coming from you.
Shut up, Planchet.

Yes, sir.

Don't!

We took the precaution of removing
the gun powder.

What now?
You give me the diamonds.

Or I take
them off your corpse.

Dealer's choice.

Anything else you like me to take off?

Outside.

Boys. Been a while.

This must
be the young Gascon.

We've met before.

Ah, yes. Small world.

I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

You do remember that, don't you?

Did you kill Buckingham?

No.

But you will kill me.
Yes

You'd spare him, but kill me.

Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

Here. You might find a use for this.

Move.

Athos.

At least she
died the way she lived.

On her own terms.

No. She did it for me.

I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I
pulled the trigger.

C'mon. Let's go home.

Your Majesty!

My dear.
You look troubled.

Hardly.

Your Majesty just startled me.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I just...
wanted to drop by

and tell you how much I am looking forward
to tonight.

It should be quite spectacular, you
know.

Costumes, fireworks, and such.

But you...

you shall be the most
spectacular sight of all.

And especially since you'll wear the
diamonds.

You will wear them, won't you?

Well, it's very important
for me that you do.

Then I shall wear them, your Majesty.

Until tonight then.

She promised she'll wear them.

You do think she'll wear them? Don't
you, Richelieu?

I'm sure she will, your Majesty.

I'm sure she will.

I- I'm in trouble.

Damn!

Now that we got their attention...

Now let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

More or less.

Gascon!

So you've traded up when it comes
to transport

once again,
you're outmatched.

You can thank
Milady for that.

She passed on Buckingham's
plans a long time ago.

As you can see,
we've made some improvements.

Isn't she a beauty?

What do you want?

The diamonds?

Come and take them.

Gladly.

You see, I can blast you out
of the sky with total impunity.

If you fire on me, on the other hand,

you'd be killing Ms. Oh So Young and Pretty.

You have 60 seconds.

He'll shoot us down the moment he
has the diamonds.

We can't outrun them.

We can fight, damn it! We can...

Uh, D'Artagnan...
What?

Do you think you have
the monopoly on loss?!

What if she dies?

The life of one
woman or the future of France!

What would you do if you were in
my position?!

I've made a lot of sacrifices. Made a
lot of hard choices.

For honor, for King, for country. Do you
know what I 've learned, boy?

Hard choices and sacrifices do not keep
you warm at night.

And life is too damn short and
too damn long

to go through without
someone at your side.

Don't end up
like me.

Choose the woman.

Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

France will take care
of itself.

Time's up!

An exchange.

I go aboard your
ship with the diamonds.

The girl goes aboard ours.

Once I know she's
safe,

I give them to you.

Fine.

But I want to see the
diamonds first.

Planchet.

Cut her loose.

Aboard the gangway!
Aboard the gangway!

Satisfied?

You never learn, do you?

Fire!

Hard right!

Fire!

Good!

I really want you to see this.

Finish them off!

We can't outrun
them. We can't outgun them.

We can try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it'll work.

We hide. In there.

Fire!

Follow them!

He's persistent, I'll give him that.

But sir?

We can't go
into the storm!

Anyone? Anyone else
who wants to question orders?

Good.

Sir!

Now, might be a good time to talk about the possibility

of a raise?
Shut up, Planchet!

Yes, sir.

Where are they?

You'll never gonna find them in there.

Oh, I beg to differ.

Keep after them!

I'll take the Gascon!

You know what your problem is, boy?

You've read too many books.

And then
you believed them.

Courage. Honor.

All for one.

But history isn't written by
heroes.

It's written by victors.

Keep your eyes open.

Round two.

Ohh ss...

Set sail!
We're too heavy!

Are you scared to take me in a fair fight?

Hardly.

I just don't fight fair.

Captain Rochefort!

Captain Rochefort!

Well, well.

Drop the barrells!

Drop everything!

And fire up the burners!

Faster!
Move!

Shall we?

Hold on!

Get out of the way!

I still have the diamonds.

What do
you propose to do about that?

Kill you.

If you insist.

Close.

You should have stayed in Gascon, boy.

You should have apologized to my horse.

Surround the palace! Shoot the
Musketeers on sight!

Use every man at
your disposal! Any means necessary!

Your Eminence...
Don't interrupt!

These men must not...

Arrest these men!

What is the meaning of this?

Your Majesty...
These men...

Are delivering a gift for your
Majesty.

Compliments of the Cardinal.

Cardinal! You shouldn't have!

Well, your Majesty did ask me to
get you one of those.

So I did!

But what happened to it?

Buckingham's spy, Captain Rochefort,
attempted to sabotage the craft.

He's been dealt with.
Rochefort?

His the Captain of your Guards, isn't he?

Actually His Eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor.

"It is by my order and for the good of
the State

that the bearer of this has
done what has been done."

That's your
signature, isn't it, Richelieu?

It would appear so, your Majesty.

Well, let me get this right. You brought me an airship

and exposed a snake in our midst!

How could I ever repay you?

I could think of a few ways.

Anne.

I was just returning from the jewelers.

When I realized it's
a little early.

but the orchestra is here,
and so are we.

Would your Majesty care to dance?

I would love to.

Well, mind out you fellas...

D'Artagnan...

Well, well, well.

Looks like you aren't
the only one who gets the girl.

Your Majesty is a natural.

Guess I am.

As a matter of fact,

I think you'll start noticing a few
more changes around here.

Thank you.

For everything.

Any time.

Well, strike out, then.
Your Majesty!

Positions please
gentlemen!

Well played.

I could use men like you.

I already have a job.
I'm a drunk.

I'm... independently wealthy.

Thanks, but no.

The day will come when you wish you had said "yes".

Maybe, but not today.

Maybe, not today.

Enjoying the show?

Are you always this cocky?

Only on Tuesdays. And when
beautiful women

are involved.

So...
You think I'm beautiful?

Actually, it's Tuesday.

So...
what now?

We drink.

Then what?

Wherever they send us. Whatever
France needs.

I thought you don't believe in that
stuff anymore.

I believe in us.

And until the day I stop believing that,
there are still

things in this
world worth fighting and dying for.

www.upwned.com

All for one,
and one for all!

You know, sirs. I know you can be a
mean, tough,

foul tempered bastard.
But sometimes,

I get the
feeling that deep down you're all...

Shut up,
Planchet!

Yeah, yeah, of course...

In case you are wondering,

this isn't the afterlife.

I'm not dead.
And neither you.

How... did you?

Followed Athos. We fished you out
of the Channel.

Where... are we going?
To France, of course!

To get back what's mine.
And pay back with interest.
