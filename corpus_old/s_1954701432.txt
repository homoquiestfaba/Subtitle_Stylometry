[ groans ]

JIMMY: Now, here's a promise.

If you do not lose the match,
you're gonna be found

at the bottom of the swimming
pool wearing lead boots.

Is there any part of that you
don't understand?

[ groans ]

And one more thing.

Not a word of this to anybody,

because I will know.

I will know.

[ music ]

[ alarm beeping ]

[ beeping continues ]

Okay.

[ alarm stops ]

Oh, great.

[ snoring ]

AUGIE: All right,
boys and girls.

Let's do it.

We got to hurry up.

The mayor himself's gonna want
to come out here and play.

Well, what's it for?

Five bucks.

Five bucks? Why don't we
make it 110 bucks?

As if he had it.

Okay, 10? NATALIE: 10's good.

All right, cool. Here, give
me back the money.

Give me that money.

Here you go, Princess. Cheers.

All right, classic
cross-country golf rules.

You can tee it up
anywhere you want to,

but you can't run with it or
throw it, Natalie.

AUGIE: Yeah, you gotta hit it
over a building,

under a bridge, through
the tunnel.

You ready, sports fans?

First one to hole out
at the Muni.

May the best woman win.

Ready, set...

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a second!

Shouldn't we give Natalie
a head start?

Yeah, shouldn't Natalie
have a head start?

You know what, baby? What?

I'm gonna give you a
30-second head start.

[ sighs ] What?

You ready? Mm-hmm.

All right, three, two, one!

Oh, that's my girl!

I can't believe you let her
have a head start!

She's smarter, faster, and a be
better putter than you are.

You know what? A real gentleman
wouldn't even ask

that question.

Well, excuse me.

On three, two...

See ya!

Dirty, rotten, cheatin'
bastard!

[ rhythmic music ]

Hey, Lionel?

I'm gonna leave you some money,
okay?

This is for food, not
for drinks.

God loves you, baby.

What are you doing?

I'm playin' golf.

I love golf.

Augustus Maximus Baccus, this a
ain't no golf course.

Well, look at this.

My old Little League coach,

now a uniformed motorcycle cop.

Well, praise the Lord, man.

I feel much safer now.

Well, you winnin'?

Not really.

Well, hell, get on.

You serious?

Come on before somebody pulls
out a cell phone.

Yee-haw!

Sir, just a second!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Sorry, guys!

I'm trying to beat Augie and Na
Natalie to the 18th!

Thank you, Buster!

Hey, I'll share my winnings wit
h you, all right?

NATALIE: Oh!

Oh, no! No!

You can't use motorized
assistance, you schmuck!

We are filing an official
grievance with the committee!

Oh, quit your whinin', babies!

Give me my cash.

I don't have it.

What? You don't have it?

Nope. Gave it to Lionel.

What?!

Gave it to Lionel?

Baby, he had no skin in
this match!

Maybe not, but he needs it
more than we do.

[ country music
playing on radio ]

Pardon me. [ volume decreases ]

Can I ask you a question?

Ask and you shall receive.

If Jesus never wrote
anything down,

which he didn't,

and people didn't start quotin'
him

till hundreds of years
after he died,

then how can you be sure he
d what he was supposed

to have said?

Well, if I understand
your question,

and I think I do, the
answer is I can't.

My question to you, since you
are obviously a

religious scholar,

is how can you be sure he didn't
t?

[ chuckles ] You got me there.

Here's another weighty one.

Honey orange tangerine

or plum apple purple?

To eat, or to put on your toes?

I'd be happy to provide the
answer you want

in exchange for changing the
radio station.

No, I think I'll paint my
left big toe purple,

and alternate my other toes
orange, purple, orange, purple.

Say what now?

And vice-versa on the
other foot.

[ laughs ]

Come on.

Change away.

Thank you.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Here on
the final hole

of the City Championship,

tournament leader Augie Baccus

is attempting to play a
ricochet shot

off a tree behind the green.

Whoo!

[ cheering and applause ]

[ whistling ]

ANNOUNCER: And now, this
putt for the win.

Oh!

[ applause ]

Baby, what's got you all
fired up today?

I think you came in first,
second, and third!

Augie. Augie, hi. Can I have
a word with you?

Sure. Yes, ma'am.

Okay. Hi,

this is Suzi Simmons
reporting live

from the Sure Thing Brake and L
Lube City Championship,

where today Augie Baccus shot a
65 in the morning

to tie the course record,

and in the afternoon, came back

and shot a 63 to break the
course record by two shots.

SUZI: That's not a typo, folks.

A one-day event,

and this guy shoots
14 under par

and wins by 15 shots.

So, darlin', tell me how
you did that.

Well, uh, three
things actually.

One, hard work,

belief in the Almighty,

and, uh, jaw-droppin' talent

all blended together in
perfect harmony.

[ chuckles ]

Nah, ma'am, I'm just messin'
with you.

Sometimes the good Lord
just blesses you.

SUZI: Well, he sure
blessed you today.

Thanks for talking with us,
Augie.

AUGIE: Thank you.

SUZI: Congratulations.

AUGIE: Thank you, ma'am.

[ crowd cheering ]

[ tires screech ]

AUGIE: Three, two...

NATALIE: One! Go!

[ coins clinking ]

Oh, that is me!

That is me again!

[ overlapping voices ]

Hello!

AUGIE: Keep givin' me quarters!

Keep givin' me quarters!

Anybody here?!

MAN: Why do you always
have to cheat?

AUGIE: Well, hey, are you
out of quarters?

Hi! Hello!

Can we get some service here?

You miss out on it.

Shoot!

Okay, here we go. Ready?

Three, two, one. Get
inside the re!

[ coins clanking ]

Thank you very much, boys! Oh!

Thank you very much!

MAN: Yeah, why don't you just
go cheat again?

Good afternoon.

Hi. Sir, and...

Good afternoon.

Good afternoon to your hat.

[ chuckles ] You work here?

No, I was just, you know,
stand in' around

and heard you yellin'.

Ah ha!

Okay. So, good.

So where do we go from here?

Well, judgin' from the
looks of things,

you two are not lookin'
for a tee time.

Well, you know, things aren't a
always what they appear to be.

Thank you, ma'am.

I wouldn't have known that if y
you didn't tell me.

Okay, here's the deal.

We were drivin' cross-country.

Heard about that fella

who won the golf
tournament today.

And so?

RIVERBOAT: And so, can
I meet him?

Well, you can pretty much do

whatever you want around here,
mister.

Why do you need to meet him?

Well, I need an answer to a
simple question.

Is he really that good?

In golf, it comes down
to a number.

Can't put any spin on numbers.

They don't lie.

JESSIE: Well, lookee here.

We wouldn't have known that if
you hadn't of told us.

[ chuckles ]

See how beautifully we're
all gettin' along?

Well, look, if he's
that damn good,

his life could change for the
better in a big hurry.

You don't say?

Oh, I do say.

Oh, he says.

All right.

See you on the first tee.

Is that the guy?

Why don't you go find out
for yourself?

Looks like the caddy.

[ blues song playing ]

Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

Wow.

Yeah, it's not the caddy.

[ song continuing ]

[ ball rattles in cup ]

Impressive!

Thank you.

Now, why'd you putt it
with one hand?

Well, uh, sometimes
we want to have

a left-to-right breaking putt.

I like to putt with
my left hand.

Helps me keep my putter
square in line.

I drain it most of the time
doing it that way.

And you knew you were
gonna play

that iron for your second shot?

Yes, sir. Pitching wedge, hard,
medium, soft.

It just depends on how I
catch my tee shot.

Ha! Well, son, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

People call me Riverboat.

This here's Jessie.

Most people call her The Bank.

Oh. Well, why they
call you that?

Use your imagination.

Let me cut to the chase here.

Now, I make it my business to
understand odds.

You know, the likelihood
happenin' or not.

Go on.

Well, no offense,

but most people lookin' at you
are not likely to think

you're as good as you
may well be.

I also happen to know
a few fellas

with lots of cash

who wouldn't mind losing it,

provided they had the
right opportunity.

And that might be me?

Might be.

So you're a
professional gambler.

Call it what you like.

And you want me to
play for you?

I got a suspicion you and me

could do some pretty
good damage.

Well, sorry, sir, but I
don't gamble.

Well, all you gotta do is
play golf and win.

RIVERBOAT: Just
collect a share,

that's all.

No, you know, I really
like your name,

uh, Mr. Riverboat.

I really do, but I'm
not your man.

Well, that's too bad.

You see, I got big dreams.

Big dreams,

I just don't see y'all in 'em.

Well, see, I'm the kind of guy

who's in the business of makin'
dreams come true.

That may be the case,
but not mine.

It was really nice to
meet you folks.

Take care.

Okay.

Shoot.

[ reading French phrases ]

What's that?

"I'm hungry."

You're hungry?

Baby, you just had a big lunch.

[ chuckles ]

No, silly, I'm practicing
like you practice.

[ speaking French ]

[ repeats sentence ] I give up.

[ laughing ]

"I'd like to go to Paris."

You want to take me to Paris?

Paris? Mm-hmm.

I can take you to Paris, baby.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah. I want to be your
passport out of here,

show you the world.

[ laughs ]

How you gonna do that?

Well, big dreams,
follow and win,

and a little bit of luck.

[ laughs ]

[ whispering ] Let's start with
Paris, Texas, first.

[ laughs ]

[ praying together ] Help us to
do the things we should,

to be to others kind and good.

In all we do, work or play,

to grow more loving every day.
Amen.

Ah! Let's eat. You hungry?

So how many tried out today?

18 girls and one boy.

Oh, well, we got this
in the bag.

How many make the squad?

ROSIE: Eight.

AUGIE: Eight? That's perfect.

All you gotta do is have faith,
baby.

It's yours.

How much is a
cheerleader uniform?

They didn't say.

Mom, I think we can afford

a cheerleading uniform
for Rosie, okay?

No, I know.

She deserves it.

I have faith in you, baby girl.

Jellyfish, pound it!

Pow-wow-wow.

Atta girl.

[ laughing ]

[door closes] Want to go to
the range with me tonight?

ROSIE: Sure.

Hit some balls?

Work on your putting stroke?

[ footsteps ]

How was your day, Ray?

RAYMOND: So-so.

Trying out for our school
cheer leading squad.

Oh, just what the world needs,

another cheerleader.

What's this supposed to be?

Chicken Enchiladas.
You like it?

And you, son? What'd
you do today?

Worked in the shop, practiced.

Why are you wearing
your hat in side?

It's disrespectful.

Sorry, Mama.

[ spits ]

You call this Chicken
Enchilada?

Tastes like chicken shit to me.

Well, you don't have to eat it
if you don't like it!

Says who?

Says me.

BETH: Hey, Augie.

[ screams ]

Look who's growing some balls.

Mama's little boy.

Come on, show me what you got.

No. No, no! Augie, Augie,
don't, don't!

Get out.

Fine. Hey.

[ door opens ]

[ closes ]

Hey, Rosie.

Hey, it's okay.

I'm sorry.

I love you, okay? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

So what you want to do

is you want to dip in the
paint, okay?

Obviously.

Take it and pat it
back like this.

Tap it on that side and the
other side so it doesn't drip.

You see that? Mm-hmm.

What you do is you just
take it up here,

back and forth just like that.

Yep, long strokes,
longer strokes.

Okay. Yeah, there you go.

They pay 7.50 a hour for this?

Yes, ma'am.

Cool. So any tips for
good work?

Sure, I'll give you some tips.

Brush your teeth.

Shower once a day.

Eat your veggies, you
little weakling.

NATALIE: Okay, well, I have
a tip for you.

Smart asses don't make it to
the promised land.

AUGIE: Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

You don't think I have a
say in the matter?

You got a say.

I already know what
you're gonna say.

[ chuckles ]

I would say that you are cocky,
arrogant,

and don't appreciate
what you got.

Cocky?

Mm-hmm. I say that
you ought to be

put on rations for a while.

Rations? Mm-hmm.

So, what? Now I gotta beg
for it, huh?

Let's get you off this thing.

Good mornin'!

I heard there was a budding Pi-
Picasso around here,

paintin' his masterpiece.

How'd you find us?

Let's just say I got
my sources.

Well, that's great.

Source that brush over there

and make yourself useful.

[ chuckles ]

I don't do manual
labor anymore.

Neither should you.

Nothin' wrong with
manual labor.

RIVERBOAT: Story of my youth,
little darlin'.

Augie, you interested in
hearing a proposition

that'll pay you more than
paint in' 100 houses?

No, sir.

Be a hell of a lot more fun,
too.

I found this fat cat

who thinks his home
pro can play,

and lucky for us, he's got more
money than brains.

Well, Augie's not interested.

He's gonna make money the
old-fashioned way.

By winning the U.S. Open, hmm?

Damn straight, pretty girl.

Yep.

Well, I hate to differ
with you, kids,

but people been wagerin'
on golf matches

long before there was ever a U.
S. Open.

Well, just out of curiosity,

how much is more than
painting 100 houses?

Ooh...

let's see.

How's that for starters?

It's a thousand dollars.

All I gotta do is play golf?

All you gotta do is play golf.

Today, Beau Rivage,

high noon.

What?

What, babe?

I didn't say yes.

TUFFY: So your boy's so good

that, uh, he don't even have
to warm up, huh?

Apparently not.

What's your game?

$5,000 Nassau.

So we're talking 5,000
on the front,

5,000 on the back, 5,000 on 18.

Press when you're pissed off.

I have that right?

As if you have to ask.

[ Riverboat laughs ]

Ah. What is that?

It's my horse.

You gotta be kiddin' me.

Let's see.

Okay.

RIVERBOAT: Augie's here, honey.

What? Okay.

Shot.

[ clapping ]

Afternoon, Augie.

TUFFY: Oops. [ chuckling ]

Come on.

Okay.

Oh, my Lord.

[ snorts ]

Shit.

[ club swings ]

Good-bye.

[ bushes rustle ]

2 down after two!

So how's it goin' for you
there, Boat?

We concede. What the
hell you doin'?

I'm playin' golf. What's
it look like?

Hogwash. Get out of your head,
boy.

Temper's instant death in golf.

It's like boxin', right?

Boxer gets mad, gets
too aggressive,

drops his guard, wham!

He's a goner.

God. I hate that fat guy.

Listen to me.

Can you handle this,
or can't you?

Yeah, I can handle it.

Shot.

[ clapping ]

Ha! Whoo!

[ laughs ] That's the shot!

Augie! Yeah!

That's it right there.

[ whistling ]

Okay, son.

We're 1 up on the last hole.

You just nestle that
little sucker

right up there next to the jar

and we waltz home smilin'.

Yes, sir.

Go.

RIVERBOAT: Ha ha!

PRO: Get legs.

RIVERBOAT: Oh, yes!

And so the pro goes to a
watery grave!

Augie, listen to me.

Augie, hey, listen.

Listen here.

All you gotta do...

All you gotta do is hit
it over that H20

right up on the green

and snatch victory from the
jaw s of the defeat.

All right, now don't screw
it up, all right?

All right, all right.
You can d o it.

[ Jessie speaks ] Shh, shh,
shh!

Bring it home!

Shh! Shh!

RIVERBOAT: Augie! Come on!

Yes! Whoo!

Whoo!

That's my boy!

So, you concede?

Match ends all square.

Worst possible outcome.

Gentlemen, play one more hole?

Winner takes all?

One hole for 15 Gs?

I don't know. You game?

I don't know. Am I?

Oh! [ crowd groans ]

Baby.

AUGIE: That's good.

Shall we try it?

Might as well.

Hey, can I bum that cigarette?

Shouldn't be smokin'.

It's bad for your health.

JESSIE: What are they doin'?

Never seen it before,

but it's hard to read the break
of a putt in the dark,

so she's probably placing
that cigarette

at the point where he's gotta h
hit it to make it.

JESSIE: And that's fair?

RIVERBOAT: Since when you
worried about fair?

Yes! Whoo!

Augie! Ha!

I don't think that that
exactly complies

with the rules of the United St
States Golf Association.

Well, who said anything
about rules?

This is real golf played
by real people.

I don't ever want to see your s
sorry-ass face around

here again.

You understand me?

Not a problem.

Oh, yeah, real quick.

Your name is Tuffy? Is
that right?

Yeah.

Now, why is that?

I'll show you why, you
son of a bitch.

[ laughs ] Now, that was fun,
right?

Had more fun in a
dentist's chair.

Well, maybe this will take
some of the sting

out of it, darlin'.

Augie, this is your share of
to day's winnings.

Plus, a little down payment
on your future.

Now, this is cold, hard, U.S.
o f A. currency.

You can stick it right straight
into your britches,

and Uncle Sam will never know
t he difference.

NATALIE: How do you
sleep at night?

Like a baby after sucking on
hi s mama's tit.

Ha ha!

We'll see you around.

Good job, baby.

Thank you, ma'am.

Just like that,

he signs a deal with the devil.

Nice goin', Augie.

Mmm.

Robbed a bank today, ladies.

Ten freshly minted $100 bills.

Pay for gas, food, rent,
whatever you want,

and, Mama, please, please buy
you something, okay?

Buy something nice.

Augie, where did you get this?

Playin' golf.

I won it fair and square.

Oh... [ bag rustles ]

Rosie, got somethin' for you.

Mama! Mama! Look!

My cheerleading uniform!

You like it? Yeah?

Look what's in there!

There's more! Yeah?

Ohh!

Do you like it, baby girl? Huh?

Do you like it?

Well, go try it on.

Go try it on.

Augie? Hmm?

Mama, it's yours.

LITTLE JOHN: Now,
first thing is,

this ain't no U.S. Open,

which means you can
move your b all

even if it's in the rough,

'cause most players
do it anyway,

and since I'm doin' the
talking here,

I'll go ahead and call
the first game.

It'll be Lakewood,

better known as
Screaming Jesus,

which for those who are unwashed
d and uninitiated,

that means that you can do
absolutely anything

on God's green earth to
your opponent,

'cept for touchin'. MAN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

Enough of the bullshit,
Little John.

Let's play golf. Let's go.

$1,000 a hole, three ways?

MAN: Low ball wins.

You boys bring plenty of cash?

Does an armadillo have balls?

I actually don't know. Does he?

Can we get this thing started,
please?

Step back. Give the boy a
lil peace and quiet, please.

So you can scream?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

JOHN TOM: Ball.

LITTLE JOHN: Nice hit,
my friend.

JOHN TOM: Good ball. Good ball.

AUGIE: I didn't see it.
Did you see it?

Oh, it's way down there!

It's way down there.

I'm gonna take your... I'm gonna
take your tees, John Tom.

JOHN TOM: You can do
whatever you like, son.

All right, here we go.

RIVERBOAT: Come on, Augie.

Y'all just keep your
mouth shut.

[ all shouting ]

[ Riverboat laughs ]

Excuse us, gentlemen.

Yeah, I'll take that.

MAN: We'll eat that up.

Show 'em what you got, baby.

Show 'em what you got.

Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
who a!

Where y'all goin'?

JOHN TOM: We ain't stoppin'
any body!

We ain't gonna interfere
with anybody!

Hit them. Hit them.

Don't even worry about
the fair way.

Yeah! Get outta here!

Oh! Ho!

LITTLE JOHN: That's a tough one
, double breaker.

MAN: Hey, tie your shoe, Augie.

JOHN TOM: Look at my putter. Lo
ok at my putter, Augie!

Look at my putter! Now
look at my hand!

Which one are you
supposed to look at?

Oh, no! What are you...

[ ball rattles in cup ] Oh!

Whoo! Yes!

Smooth, baby.

LITTLE JOHN: All right,
John Tom.

Just concentrate there, man.

Putter getting hot?

Don't look at this.

Don't look at this. Look
at your ball.

Look at your ball. [ gunshot ]

Whoo! [laughing ]

Blanks!

[ Riverboat laughs ]

Jessie, baby, do the honors.

JOHN TOM: Man, that's crazy!
He has a gun?

Really, Riverboat?

Petit Jean, thank you, doll.

Get me some of them
red-bottom shoes.

AUGIE: So, Riverboat, you're
a man of action.

Let's have a little action,
huh?

Let's bet I can put
this on the green

with this here putter.

RIVERBOAT: Say what?

What part of that didn't
you understand?

With your putter?

With my putter.

I can tell you right now,
I'll take that bet.

How sure are we?

Pretty damn sure.

Okay, thrill-seekers. Side bet.

2 grand says that Augie
cannot put that ball

on that green with that putter.

Honey, we down with this?

No guts, no glory.

Good luck.

[ strikes ball ]

RIVERBOAT: That's
gonna make it!

Oh-ho!

JESSIE: Oh, baby! Ho!

Bam!

$2,000, please!

Congratulations.

Whoo!

John Tom, we still got 2
grand on this hole

from the original bet.

I want you to pretend

like you're Tiger Woods
at the Masters

and ram that sucker in the jar.

Guarantee Augie will miss.

There it is. Come on, baby.

Come on for papa! Come on!

Come on! No, John Tom!

I'd rather stick my arm

in the south end of an angry
bull headin' north

than for you to leave
that putt short!

I'll tell you what, Little
John, calm down.

I'll let you buy this putt right
here for $1,000.

And sacrifice my manhood
in the process?

No, thank you.

Augie, do what you gotta do.

Ah ha. All right, Augie.

Yeah! OlÃ©!

Come on!

JESSIE: Love that, baby.

LITTLE JOHN: No, no, no, no!

I hate golf!

[ laughing ]

That's unfortunate.

Oh, no.

Oh! Oh!

Pleasure doing business
with you, baby.

I wish I could say the same.

Okay, come here.

I got you.

[ laughing ]

[ kiss ]

I love this game.

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco,
seis,

7, 8, 9, 10 Benjamins.

Don't spend it all in one
place, baby.

Oh, don't you worry about that.

Siete, darlin'.

I know. It's just it
doesn't rhyme.

That's why I always forget it.

So where's your girlfriend?

She's missin' out on
all the fun.

Oh, she, uh...

She's taking French classes.

She really wants to
go to Paris.

Something about a past life
attraction or something.

Too bad she's not a
little more obsessed

with makin' money in this life.

So, Riverboat, what got
you caught up

in all this racket anyway?

Well, now...

Well, when I was a kid,

I was pretty good at pitchin'
horseshoes.

One day after I got
whipped pretty good

for the few dollars I had,

I discovered the son of a bitch

had moved the pitch back one
foot, 41 feet.

I tracked his sorry ass down

and asked for my money back.

You should have kicked his ass.

Yeah, well, I did get
my money back.

And then he taught me
some things

much more valuable than money.

What's that?

Well...

Uh, see that watermelon
over there?

AUGIE: Yeah.

Now, what are the odds
that you could

pitch one of these cards
across the room

and have it stick in
that melon?

I would say the odds are pretty
good it can't be done.

Okay. Stick one of
them $100 bills

you just won on that table.

Ahem.

[ tapping ]

By The Bank, baby.

RIVERBOAT: You ready?

Ready?

Ha!

Oh!

AUGIE: Wow!

See, if you try to pitch it nor
mal like a baseball,

won't stick,

but if you pull it back
by your wrist

and then fling it out
backwards,

it generates more velocity.

Card flies sure and
straight and...

[ applause ] AUGIE: Holy shit!

Wow!

RIVERBOAT: Sticks in there.

[ applause ]

Thats... That's magic!

Yeah, well, the art of gamblin'

is to make the other guy think
it is what it appears to be

when you've made damn good
and sure it's not.

So it never is what it seems.

Never. Or near enough never.

Boy, you sure like to live the
hustle, Mr. Riverboat.

JESSIE: Oh, he'd rather be
buried alive six feet under

in a cement casket with a bet h
e couldn't get out

than live a day without
some action.

RIVERBOAT: All right!

JESSIE: All right, show's over,
folks.

[ applause ] Best
dinner I ever had.

BETH: Raymond!

ROSIE: Augie! Augie, come
quick! It's Mama!

[ glass breaks ] Raymond, get!

ROSIE: He's hurting Mama!

Come quick, Augie!

[ overlapping shouting ]

[ phone dialing ]

ROSIE: Mommy!

Morgan! Morgan, he's back!

[ shouting continues ]

Hey! Get off of her!

Get off of her!

Mama, get her out of here and l
lock the door! Hurry!

BETH: We stay together!

Go!

You ungrateful woman!

I got my rights!

You have no rights in this
house! Now get out!

Who's gonna pay the bills, you?

Who in their right mind's gonna
want to take care of...

We don't need your damn money!

Now get outta here!

All right.

All right, you want
me to leave?

Yeah.

[ siren ] I'll leave! Huh?

Get out of here!

Augie!

Not so fast, Raymond.

Now, we got a call

about a domestic disturbance
at this address.

I don't suppose you know
anything about that, do you?

You leave this house
before I s ay,

you'll regret you did.

Now, who you suppose
did all this?

I'm sorry this happened to you,
Bethie.

Very sorry.

You know what, Raymond?
You're under arrest.

Consider this your Miranda.

[ handcuffs click ]

Come on.

[ door closes ]

[ rock music playing ]

Â¶ To hear it told Â¶

Â¶ I am the man of the hour Â¶

Â¶ But my hold is
starting to slip Â¶

Whoo! Ha!

Yeah!

Come on! [ volume decreases ]

Where'd you learn to hit
it like that?

Jack Nicklaus.

I always try to do what he did

just the way he did it.

Hoo!

And I assume you can hit
all the shots...

cuts and draws in bunches.

My Lord.

Whoo-hoo!

[ volume increases ]

AUGIE: See you later.

See you later.

[ Riverboat whistling ]

Â¶ But I suspect that my
enemies are plotting Â¶

[ rhythmic knock on door ]

Hey.

[ chuckles ]

Is there no place to
hide from you?

Sorry to disturb, little
darlin '. My bad.

But I thought you wouldn't
mind for this.

Listen, partner,

we done worn out our
welcome around here.

It's time to move on to
greener pastures.

Las Vegas, baby.

Where the big fish swim.

Along with every shark
known to man.

To kill a shark, all you need t
to do is think like a shark.

Darlin', this ain't no time

to walk away from a winnin'
hand.

How much could I make?

Why don't we put it this way?

You come to Vegas, you
play half decent,

can stand the heat in
the kitchen?

You'll make $100,000
guaranteed.

$100,000?

RIVERBOAT: Cash money.

NATALIE: And about how much
will you make?

Enough to make it
worth my while.

Baby, I never been to Vegas.

Well, you never been to hell,
either.

About time you came.

Great city.

Entertainment capital
of the world.

Will you excuse me?

Have a pleasant evening.

My daddy always said you fly
with the crows,

you get shot with the crows.

Babe, where you going?

Hey, Natalie?

Natalie.

[ horn honks ]

You goin' my way, gorgeous?

Get lost.

Come on, Natalie. Look,
you had your fun.

I don't even recognize you
anymore, Augie.

Natalie, look at me.

There are things that you
don't know, okay?

Okay, here's what I do know.

I know that if you don't care a
bout your own damn dreams,

how can you care about
your girlfriend's

or anything else in your whole
damn life you pretend to love?

Natalie.

[ engine stops ]

Natalie?

Hey.

Natalie? Natalie.

Knock it off.

I need you to be my
friend right now.

Okay. You want me to be
your friend?

Follow your heart, baby,
not your wallet.

Hey, did you know that
Lee Trevino

and Raymond Floyd played in big
Time money matches?

Lee Trevino.

Okay, Augie.

You walk this path...

and you walk it without me.

No, listen.

I need to tell you something.

Look at me.

I need for you to listen, okay?

Afterwards, you can do whatever
the hell you gotta do.

Just listen.

Well, this better be good.

I haven't told this to anybody.

One night, when I was
coming ho me

from basketball practice in
high school...

I heard a baby crying
in a dumpster.

I opened it up and there was
this little girl.

And I picked her up,
and I held her.

I didn't know what to do.

And I took her home,

and I handed her to my mom,

and she held her like her own.

And we called the
police stations.

We called the TV stations and
t he newspapers,

and no one claimed her.

She wasn't missing. She
was abandoned.

Rosie?

Yeah, Rosie.

I wanted to give her a
decent life,

and that's what we're doin'.

We'll tell her someday
when she 's older.

But I gotta get my
family and you,

I gotta get us out of this
sorry-ass life.

Babe, look, you're doin' it
for the right cause,

but it's not the
right solution.

But there ain't nobody else.

I'm just sayin' Riverboat is no
the answer, okay?

He's a one-way ticket to hell.

Is your soul judged for that?

All right, you know what?

I know I can't talk
you out of this,

so you go do whatever it is the
hell you gotta do.

But when you think about this 2
0 years from now,

just remember you did this to
yourself, okay?

[ song begins ]

Â¶ Drivin' down a lonely road Â¶

Â¶ Seein' my head explode Â¶

Â¶ Tryin' to snuff
out the fear Â¶

Â¶ Runnin' from the man inside Â¶

Â¶ Runnin' from my
father's pride Â¶

Â¶ Runnin' with my girl
by my side Â¶

RIVERBOAT: Flippity-flop,
gents.

Check.

Check.

Cost you $5,000 to play, boys.

PLAYER: I fold.

PLAYER 2: My
sentiments exactly.

Well, I can't let you have
all the fun. Call.

RIVERBOAT: Turn.

Sure.

Bet is 20 Gs.

Ooh, bold, decisive,
aggressive.

I like that in a man.

Call.

River card, ladies.

Bam! King of diamonds.

Poker time.

Possible straight,
possible flu sh.

I don't think you got the
goods, my friend.

$50,000 finds out.

On the other hand, you might ha
have kings tucked under there.

JIMMY: Mm-hmm. Well, how curious
are you to find out?

Curious enough.

I will see your 50,

and bump it to 100.

Didn't your mama ever teach you

that it's impolite to wear
a ha t indoors?

[ laughing ]

Didn't your mama teach
you it's impolite

to ask a stranger an
impolite question?

Well, she obviously

never taught you that's
it impolite

to answer a question
with a question.

And I raise you another 100.

[ player whistles ]

Call.

PLAYER 2: Uno king.

Tres hombres, kings. Ai!

PLAYER 2: Ooh, diamonds are a g
girl's best friend.

Oh, Ty-D-Bol, flush time.

[ laughing ]

So the flush beats three kings.

I know what it beats.

What are the odds on that?

About five to one.

You wouldn't be cheatin' me,
would you, friend?

I take it you're not serious
out that question.

Like a heart attack.

Tell you what.

Since you're so stressed out

about someone cheatin' you, how
about we cut cards?

No possible cheatin' in that.

You just can't get enough of
my money, can you?

Only if you're in the mood.

I'm always in the mood.

You call the stakes.

How much you figure you
got over there?

450,000, give or take.

Well, I guess 450,000 it is.

JESSIE: [ whispers ] All right.

That look all right to you?

Looks real good.

RIVERBOAT: Be my guest.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

PLAYER 2: Jumpin' Jack from
the house of spades.

Nice draw.

Ooh!

Want to buy off the hand?

Nah, you would not
respect a ma n

who turned tail and ran, now,
would you?

PLAYER 2: Lord, Lord.

Oh! [ laughing ]

Look at that.

Queen just beats that Jack.

Must be my lucky day.

[ knock on door ]

JESSIE: Comin' right up.

Oh, hey there.

I'm sorry. Must be the
wrong suite.

Right suite, right time.

Step right this way,
sweetheart.

You can put these over here,
baby, right here.

Okay. Uh, hey, fellas. I got me
meatball and, uh, some veggies

for those of you who want to
lo se some weight.

How about we try a
little Omaha?

Oh, now, now, come on now,
brother.

We been playing cards for 10
hours straight.

Man's gotta stretch his bones,

eat sometime.

Don't ever call me
brother again.

All right.

I want to be a
gentleman about this.

Now, give you a sportin' chance
to get your money back.

Yeah? What do you got in mind?

Well, how about we
change venue s?

Settle this at a pool table

or a racetrack or a
golf course?

This is Las Vegas, my friend.

Pool takes too long.

We don't deal with animals.

They don't listen to reason.

Suit yourself.

You know somebody around here

who's pretty good at
playing golf?

You bring your fast gun,
I bring mine.

Hmm. Who you got?

Hey, you!

Me?

Yeah, you. You play golf?

Yeah.

You any good?

I'm okay.

You ever play in competitions?

Back in high school.

JESSIE: You win?

Well, uh,

you know, I'm a little modest
t o say who won,

but, uh, I will tell you that
t he others lost.

Ha! That's good enough for me.

See, I have to give my new
friend here a cinch bet.

You free for some fun
in the sun?

Yeah. What I gotta do?

Just play 18 holes of golf

and try as hard as you can.

Sounds good. I just, uh...

I gotta be done by 6:00.

That's when my shift starts.

Okay. We know where
to find you.

Cool. Enjoy the pizza.

JESSIE: Thank you, baby!

Gentlemen?

JESSIE: You want a piece?

JIMMY: You gotta be kiddin'.

I don't eat delivered pizza.

Of course, you don't,

big spender.

PLAYER 2: You knew what was goo
d for your health,

you'd surrender that cash

and get your ass out of town
as fast as you can.

That sounds like you're a
scrawny, little schoolboy

runnin' from the class bully.

Trust me.

You do not want to lock horns w
with Jimmy Diamonds.

And why is that?

All I'm sayin'

is Jimmy Diamonds just as
soon kill you as lose.

Uh!

[ laughing ]

Hey! You lookin' at me?

Ahh!

The Indonesian Infiniblade.

What can't it cut through?

[ channel changes ]

[ porn music playing ]

Ooh!

MAN: Did you order a large?

WOMAN: I hope there's
sausage on that.

[ channel changes ]

ANNOUNCER: Today at the
Merion Cricket Club

outside Philadelphia,

the young phenom, Aaron Bolt,

captured his second consecutive
American Amateur Championship,

leaving no question about his e
merging dominance.

Many experts are
beginning to predict

he will be the next great
American golfer.

[ TV switches off ]

LANA: Â¶ Everything is tellin'
m e Â¶

[ woman laughing ]

Â¶ To finally give up Â¶

Â¶ On you Â¶

Â¶ Ain't it true? Â¶

Â¶ But I love you Â¶

Â¶ I love you Â¶

Â¶ My la-la-la la-la-la-love Â¶

Â¶ I love you Â¶

Â¶ I love you Â¶

Â¶ Oh, why do I feel... Â¶

What'll it be?

Hey, buddy, there's a two-drink
minimum for the show.

Excuse me?

If you're gonna stay,

you're gonna have to
order a drink.

Oh, uh, right. Um, yeah, sorry.

What do you like?

What do you got?

What?

What do you recommend?

Me, I like, uh, vodka,

splash of cranberry
with a twist.

Perfect. Sounds healthy.
Count me in.

Â¶ But I love you Â¶

Â¶ I love you Â¶

Â¶ My la-la-la la-la-la-love Â¶

Â¶ I love you Â¶

Â¶ I love you Â¶

Â¶ Oh, why do I feel so
bad for you Â¶

Â¶ My love Â¶

[ applause ]

Hey, Lana!

I have had it with
you coming o n

to every swingin' dick that
walks through that door!

I'm a performer. It's a show.

Grow up, asshole!

You... stop! AUGIE: Hey!

Get your hands off her!

Get lost, jerk!

That's funny. I could tell the
same thing to you.

What the hell do you think you'
re doin'?

I'm was gonna take a leak.

But now I'm gonna kick your ass
if you touch her again.

Do you know this asshole?

Yeah. He's a black
belt in karate.

I'm tempted to find out.

Suit yourself.

Thanks.

You, uh...

You sing really good.

I have my moments.

The bathroom is down the
hall on the right.

Make sure to wash your hands.

I'll wash my hands
before and after.

AARON: It sounds interesting.

What's the catch?

There's no catch. There's
no downside.

And you get to keep 10%
out of the take.

So all I gotta do is beat one g
guy I've never heard of?

[ knock on door ] One guy.

That sounds simple enough.

Yeah?

[ whispering ]
Riverboat's here.

Bring him in.

JIMMY: You ever wondered

what the devil himself
looks like?

Behold.

Aaron, say hi to Riverboat.

Riverboat, Aaron Bolt,

the number-one-ranked
amateur in the world.

Ah-ah, don't shake his hand.

He's probably got a tack
taped to his palm.

You really as good as
everybody says?

You don't have to answer that.

He's just messin'
with your head.

No, I'm better.

Wow.

On that promisin' note,

maybe we should talk
about the match.

Okay, talk.

Have you given any thoughts

about what the bet should be?

Have I given any thought to what
t the bet should be?

Yes, I have, as a
matter of fact.

One game, 18 holes,

$500,000 cash money, as
you like to say.

No side bets, and none of
the other bullshit

that you like to conjure up.

$500,000, and my boy's gotta
play Aaron Bolt,

the hottest young player in
the game today.

You bring your gunslinger,

I bring mine.

Aw, no.

Rocky Balboa versus
Apollo Creed.

[ chuckling ]

Well...

Mmm, damn it.

Ooh, okay.

Okay.

Except I think we should stop p
pussy-footin' around

and play for an even million.

[ chuckles ]

You want to... You want to
bet a million,

and you haven't seen
my man play?

Ubatz.

Probably a little
ill-advised o f me,

but there it is.

Where?

Wynn, Las Vegas.

Ha. Wynn, Las Vegas.

Now, they don't allow
two-bit hoodlums

like you on that course.

If that isn't the pot callin'
the kettle black.

But they do allow current U.S.
American champions,

thus, the tee time.

Verification of cash
at a location

to be determined in
the morning.

Two players at Wynn, Las Vegas.

18 holes, million dollars
to the winner.

Life-changing.

What's your player's name?

No, he doesn't have a name.

Well, has he played in any
national tournaments?

No. No, he doesn't.

Game on?

JIMMY: Yeah, game on. Now
get outta here.

Fuckin' clown.

[ dance music playing ]

Hey, God bless you, man.
Anything?

It's tough.

Yeah.

Thanks, man.

Hey! Hey!

Hey! Oh!

MAN: Really?! Watch where
you're goin'!

[ music ]

[ sighs ]

[ line rings ]

[ ringing and vibrating ]

Â¶ And I don't want to hurt
the one I love Â¶

Â¶ It's all around me Â¶

Â¶ Trouble Â¶

Â¶ I know you never hurt the
one you love Â¶

Â¶ And I don't want to hurt
the one I love Â¶

Â¶ Please don't make me hurt
the one I love Â¶

Â¶ Yeah Â¶

[ applause ]

Thank you.

Man, drinking alone in Vegas,

the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

Baby, I can make all your
troubles go away.

I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

Doctor, one more of
whatever he 's having

and a Scotch neat for the lady.

[ song begins ]

Â¶ Sea lion woman, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ She drank coffee, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ She drank tea, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ Way down yonder, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ I'm gonna maul, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And a rooster crow,
sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he got no lie, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ Sea lion woman, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ She drank coffee, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ She drank tea, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion Â¶

[ grunts ]

Let me take care of this, baby.

Â¶ Sea lion woman, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ She drank coffee, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ She drank tea, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ Way down yonder, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ I'm gonna maul, sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And the rooster crow,
sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And the rooster crow,
sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And the rooster crow,
sea lion Â¶

Â¶ And he got no lie, sea lion Â¶

Well, well.

Caught with your pants down.

Not so much fun, is it?

Your man and I have
arranged for a game.

You're gonna play
this young kid,

who I believe is destined to be

one of the all-time greats.

Frankly, I think that he
can be at you,

but I need for you to be
sure t hat he does.

You understand?

I asked you a question.

Do you understand?

He's deaf.

[ groans ]

JIMMY: Now, here is a promise.

If you do not lose the match,

you're gonna be found
at the bottom

of the nearest swimming pool we
wearing lead boots.

Is there any part of that you
don't understand?

And one more thing.

Not a word of this to anybody,

because I will know.

I will know.

[ gasping ]

[ pounding ]

Goin' somewhere?

Apparently not!

You're obviously not payin'
attention, boy.

Get in.

I didn't bargain for any of
this, Riverboat.

Oh, yes, you did.

Are you stupid?

You blind, or both?

You realize if you vanish
what happens to me?

No.

Why, in this town once
a bet's made,

if the player doesn't show up,

the bet is forfeited.

Gone.

Las Vegas rules.

So this great escape of
yours would cost me

million dollars cash money.

Riverboat, Jimmy Diamonds came
to my hotel room last night.

He told me if I didn't
lose this match,

he's gonna kill me.

[ chuckles ]

Now...

Now you know what your
life's worth

on the open market.

So Jimmy Diamonds
threatened to kill you

if you don't lose.

Let me give you one more
piece of information.

If you don't win, I'm
gonna kill you.

You win, you're dead.

You lose, you're dead.

How's it feel to be
caught in a squeeze?

Here's a reminder.

Now, Aaron Bolt's
gonna show up.

He's gonna play 18
holes of golf.

If you don't show up and win...

your whole world come tumblin'
down.

[ doors closing ]

[ cell phone beeping
and vibrating ]

Augie? AUGIE: Hey.

What the hell is going on?

I've been calling and calling
and texting you!

Baby, I need for you to
listen to me, okay?

I gotta tell you something
really quick.

I need for you to listen to
me carefully, okay?

No, no, no! It's not okay!

Why haven't you called me
or your mother?

Natalie, please just
listen to me.

I gotta tell you

you're probably the most perfect
person that I ever met.

I'm sorry that I didn't make you
u feel like it sometimes.

Augie, no one is perfect.

You just...

I mean, you sound like a
different person.

Here's the second thing.

And this is hard. No, kiddin',
okay?

So no flinchin'.

I need you take care of my
mama and Rosie.

If somethin' happens to me,

promise me that you will take c
are of them no matter what.

Augie? What the hell
is going o n?

Okay, you're gonna tell me what
's going on right now,

or I'm gonna hang up.

We good.

RIVERBOAT: We good.

We're good.

Jessie holds the money
in my limo,

and Lorenzo and O.D.
handle security.

How about Lorenzo and O.D. hold
the money in my car

and Jessie can kiss my ass?

Ass-kissing comin' right up.

[ dramatic music ]

Good luck.

You, too.

What's your name?

I'm Augie.

Aaron.

I know. Aaron Bolt.

[ chuckles ]

Good day, gentlemen.

I see you've already met.

Yeah, we met.

JIMMY: And we're clear what
the stakes are.

Yeah.

Okay, then.

Since we're the visiting team,

I think we should have
the honors.

Augie? Play away, please.

Shot.

Get up!

Get up!

AUGIE: Get up, get up.

Numero uno.

Cha cha cha.

JIMMY: Too bad.

AUGIE: Damn it!

JIMMY: Two down.

Got any 4s?

JESSIE: Go fish.

You got any jacks?

Man.

Ha ha!

Hand 'em over, sucker.

Four jacks for me.

Do I get to ax again?

Keep goin'.

[ suspenseful music ]

NATALIE: Hey! Hold
off a minute!

Excuse me.

[ sighs ]

One minute!

Whoo!

Sorry.

JIMMY: Who's the broad?

RIVERBOAT: Never seen
her before.

JIMMY: Why do I think
you're lyin'?

Maybe 'cause you always
think I 'm lyin'.

Hey, handsome.

Who are you?

The enemy.

That's too bad.

Oh, wow, what a beautiful hole.

And the water, it's just...

Yeah.

Okay.

Good luck.

[ blues song playing ]

Shit.

AUGIE: Sit, ball!

Sit!

RIVERBOAT: Let's go, Augie.

AUGIE: Get in!

Get in there! Yes!

Oh, yeah.

Do you remember our
conversation?

Yeah. How could I forget?

Make sure you don't.

JIMMY: You got this.

It's good.

JIMMY: That's good.

RIVERBOAT: Augie.

Nice putt.

Yeah. Yeah.

Match even goin' in
the last ho le.

Your appointment with
destiny h as arrived.

What about Jimmy Diamonds?

Why don't you win this one?

Win this for your family.

JIMMY: Final hole,

last out in baseball,

final play in football,

last minute in a
basketball game.

Moment of truth.

This is what we play for

Mm-hmm.

[ sighs ]

Where the hell is he?

Preparing to put the
final dagger

into your wicked heart.

[ sirens ]

I don't know what you're up to,

but a million dollars says

you're not gonna get
away with it.

[ police radio chatter ]

What the hell is this?

Gentlemen, sorry to
interrupt y our game,

but I'm with the Internal
Revenue Service, the IRS.

I trust you've heard of it.

What is the problem, officer?

You Reese Baudry, aka
Riverboat?

That must make you
James Diamondes,

also known as Jimmy Diamonds.

This is a private game being
played on private property.

But becomes a federal offense

when people are
gambling illegally.

See, the IRS and the FBI

have been monitoring your
gambling activities in

various state s.

Seems the two of you live pretty
y high off the hog

with no apparent income.

But you get a chance to explain
that to a federal judge.

We're placing you under arrest

for suspicion of income
tax evasion.

You have the right to
remain silent...

No, no, no. Save it!

This isn't gonna hold
up in court!

Check your history.

This is exactly how we
busted Al Capone.

You're gonna pay for this.

We'll see who pays.

Take 'em away, boys.

The rest of you are free to go.

But in future,

I'd pay more attention to the
company you keep.

Hey, haven't I seen you before?

Only in your dreams. Have a
nice life, lady.

Don't get jinky with me!

Your dreams will turn
into nightmares

when we sort this all out!

RIVERBOAT: What is this?

JIMMY: Oh, come on. FBI,
my ass.

We're being kidnapped by
the Taliban.

Ahh.

Oh, really? Really?

You two really think you're
gonna get away with this, huh?

On your knees now.

No.

[ gunshot ]

Ho! Ho! Whoa!

JIMMY: Who taught you
how to shoot?

My daddy since I was 11.

You in on this?

Yeah, I was gonna ask
you the same.

So, Riverboat, you
remember that deal

we made before we came
to Las Vegas?

You said I could win
$100,000 guaranteed.

Now, you boys put up $1
million each.

So now I am taking $100,000 of
it exactly as you said.

Not a penny more and not
a penny less,

because I believe I earned it.

You really think

you're gonna get to keep
all of that money?

You're gonna have to kill us,
both of us!

Now, in this suitcase
to my left,

we got $1.9 million,

and in this suitcase
to my right,

we got a loaded gun.

Here's the deal, gentlemen.

One of you guys are gonna get

your initial million dollars,

plus 900,000 for your troubles.

And the other one?

Well, not gonna make it home

for supper tonight
unfortunately.

Come on now, boy.

You're in way over your head.

Now, one of us is gonna
survive this charade,

and guess what?

You'll be the first point
of business.

JIMMY: That's right.

Really? Well, we've already

figured that one, didn't we,
baby?

Mm-hmm.

You see, that IRS agent that
arrested you boys,

he's actually the chief of
police in my hometown,

and he's a family friend.

So if anything happens to me,

he's gonna know who did it.

He's gonna track you down to the
e ends of the earth

and make sure that
justice is served.

[ spits ]

AUGIE: Got it? Yeah.

You got 'em, baby?

Yep.

Ow. All right.

RIVERBOAT: Shit.

Hey, you little...

Hey! [ gunshot ]

Gentlemen.

Nice doin' business with you.

NATALIE: May the
worst man lose!

Â¶ Seein' my head explode Â¶

Â¶ Tryin' to snuff out
the fears Â¶

Â¶ Runnin' from the man inside Â¶

Â¶ Runnin' from my
father's pride Â¶

Â¶ Runnin' from the girl
by my s ide Â¶

Â¶ And all of our lives Â¶

Â¶ Are lived inside once
it arrives Â¶

Â¶ And all of our dreams Â¶

Â¶ They fall apart
at the seams Â¶

Â¶ Seein' me walk away Â¶

Â¶ Nothin' more she can say Â¶

Â¶ Money has affected my heart Â¶

Â¶ It's taken its toll on me Â¶

Â¶ And all the family Â¶

Â¶ Watch me let it ride Â¶

Â¶ And all of our lives Â¶

Â¶ Are lived inside once
it arrives Â¶

Â¶ And all of our dreams Â¶

Â¶ They fall apart
at the seams Â¶
