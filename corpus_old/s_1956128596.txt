(crickets chirping)

(distant clattering)

Why are there cameras everywhere?

I don't know, mom, it's just weird.

Is daddy gonna get rid of them?

What?

There are not raccoons in the attic.

No, and I better not hear anything.

I just got here about an hour ago.

How about last night or this morning?

Okay, you guys have a good time.

I'll see you next week.

I love you.


(breathing heavily)

That's some weird ass toys.

I wonder what's in here.


Oooh, what the hell is that smell?

This better not be someone's ashes.

What the hell?

What is up with these
people and these toys.

Nope, mm-mm.

Go right back, take it
outside to your new home.

Oooh, it stinks.

You are going outside.

It's cold.

if he knew you were in
here while he wasn't.

Hello?

Well, whoever it is wanna
come and clean this up

because I'm not cleaning this up.

Who's doing this?

Hello?

(distant screaming)

(breathing heavily)

Whoever made this mess, I swear,

All this damn fake blood.

(water splashing)


This is freaking annoying.

(distant screaming)

This is disgusting.

Look at this.

If this stains my,

(Renee screaming)

Fuck.

Who's doing this?

Fuck, fuck.

Who's doing this?

I'm tired of fucking cleaning.

Look at this shit.

What is this?

Oh, this better not be blood.

Look at it all on the counter.



Hello?

Just come right up here.

(crickets chirping)

(crickets chirping)

Who's down there?

You better get the hell out of here.

How do I know someone's not watching me?

Where's the light?

(water running)

(door creaking)

(crickets chirping)

I know it's not Reggie.

I checked his Instagram
and he's in North Carolina.

I know it's not raccoons.

I sent you the video of hello
written all over the floor

and raccoons wouldn't--

Mom, why is daddy yelling?

Please tell daddy it's
not one of my friends.

I don't know who it is, but I'm scared

and I'm not imagining things.

What do you mean I might be doing it?

Sleepwalking?

I haven't done that since
I was 10 years old, mom.

I guess it's possible,
but how would I know?

Okay, momma, I will.


Love you too.

(distant laughing)


(phone beeping)

Hey, it's me, guys.

And I am back.

Um, I'm in our new house
on Steelmanville Road

and one of your fools think it's funny

to sneak in here and scare
me on my first night.

If my dad finds out you're in here,

he's gonna kill you.

(phone beeping)

(phone beeping)

Momma, you need to get some of this shit

cleaned out of here.

All right, this my aunt Bebe's room.

I just put a tape on it, so I can tell

if someone's going in or out,

but it's locked, so, yeah.

If you're hiding in
here, I'm gonna find you.

(phone beeping)

Hello?

You better not be hiding back here.

I'm gonna find you if you're in here.

(phone beeping)

Hello?

(phone beeping)

And my parents' bedroom is locked.

I don't think my parents trust me.

(phone beeping)

Hello?

This door was opened and now it's locked.

I think it's so creepy that
someone might be in here

because what if it's
somebody I don't know?

Who's in there?

Hello?

(knocking on door)

Hello?

I need a weapon.

(phone beeping)



Who are you?

(clown laughing)

Hello?

If anyone's watching

I'm on Steelmanville Road
and I'm chained up right now.

Please help.

Someone help me!

Help me!

(crickets chirping)

Please help me!

(breathing heavily)

(footsteps approaching)

Fuck.

[Tom] Fuck.

[Renee] Who the fuck are you?

I'm Tom Riley.

Who the fuck are you?

[Renee] This is my house.

Ow, shit.

Well, it used to be my house.

So, are you the old man watching me

on these damn cameras everywhere?

Look, get over yourself.

I'm binge-watching 13
Reasons Why on the iPad

I took from this house

and in the middle of it, I keep getting

these push notifications,
'cause the cameras

are still on the iPad connected here.

So, I don't give a shit what
you're doing in this house.

(crickets chirping)


And here I see you running around--

All right, well did
you see the damn clown?

Clown?

[Renee] Yes, the clown
that chained me up down here.

I bet you didn't see him.

I hate clowns.

Let...

Can we get you out of that?

[Renee] Yes.

Can I have this here, Wonder Woman?

[Renee] This hurts.

Can you...

I think these should do it.


Goddammit.

[Renee] Here, let me do it.

If I can't do it, you can't.

Here.

(crickets chirping)

(footsteps approaching)

Slow down, girl.

Damn.

I came in here, these lights were off.

The front door was open.

This door was open.

The door was unlocked?

Yeah, it was wide open.

[Renee] I locked it.

Here, let's go.

Well, where you going?

I'm getting out of here.

We don't know where he's at, so come,

let's just figure this out, come on.

Figure it out.

There was a book here, used to be here.

Where the hell is it?

Oh wait, here it is, come on.

Yeah, this is it.

This is the book I was talking about.

I was checking that out earlier.

Does clown begin with a K or a C?

Are you for real?

Come on.

A C.

All right, here it is.

Is that him?

Yep, that's him.

All right, that is
the Crescent Moon Clown,

which can only rise
during a crescent moon.

However, according to
this, the previous owner

had put it into a box,
covered it with ashes,

and sat a cross on top,

and then locked the box and put it away.

Did you find a box like this?

[Renee] Yeah, I found it downstairs

and it had this ugly doll in it

and it was stinkin',
so I threw it outside.

[Tom] So you opened it.

[Renee] Yep.

And you took the cross out.

[Renee] Yep.

Well, that's how he got free.

But, even though it's a crescent moon,

and he's out of the box, he needs a witch

to be able to convert
him into a large form,

like you say he is now.

Have you seen anything that
looks like a witch around?

[Renee] That nasty lookin'
thing with the robe on?

Yeah, that sounds like,

that sounds like it.

Well, we'll deal with her later.

We gotta deal with him first.

But you want the good
news or the bad news?

[Renee] I don't know.

There is no good news.

Here's the bad news.

According to this, the way
the Crescent Moon Clown

pays back his person that freed him

is by digging a grave, killing them,

throwing them in it, and burying them.

So, right now, this clown
is somewhere out back there,

digging a hole for you.

[Renee] Nope.

But I have an idea.

I have an idea how we're
gonna deal with this.

Come on, follow me.

All right, so here's what we're gonna do.

He still thinks you're chained
and locked in the basement.

So, that means he's
coming back to get you.

So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hide

in this room right here

and when he comes in that door,

he's gonna come here to turn
and go down the basement

and I'm gonna run forward

and just shove him down the steps,

shove him as hard as I can.

Hopefully he snaps his neck.

But I'll slam the door shut.

I'll push that chair over

and you and I will get out of here

and get as far away from
this place as possible.

[Renee] For real?

This is what we're gonna do.

So, while you go hide
out there, keep an eye.

All right.

I'm gonna hide here

and we'll wait for him to come back.

All right?

[Renee] All right.

(Tom screaming)

(Tom thudding down steps)

[Tom] Fuck.

(Renee screaming)

(Renee screaming)

What the fuck?

(heavy slapping)

Give me my damn wig.

You don't fuck with a black girl's hair.

[Tom] Did we get him?

Oh fuck, oh shit.

(low whooshing)

[Renee] You want some
of this too, bitch?

Come on.

(low whooshing)

[Tom] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

(loud banging)

(clown laughing)

[Renee] Stop it.

(clown laughing)

[Tom] Ow.

(loud banging)

(clown laughing)

(Renee screaming)

(footsteps approaching)


Renee, our plan worked.


Wait, where are you going?

Hang on.

Wait up.

Can you give me a ride to my friend's?

I would love to, but I don't own a car.

[Renee] Of course you don't.

[Tom] Hang on.

So, you gonna stay here?

[Renee] No, I'm getting out of here.

I'm moving out of the south, fool.

(distant screaming)

What the hell was that?

[Tom] Ah, it's a long story.

(low whooshing)

(childlike chiming music)

(clown laughing)
