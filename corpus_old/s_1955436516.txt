Wait!

Breakfast?

Got everything?

I got the discharge papers,
d.D. 214, the works.

Don't worry about anything.

Uncle Sam's gonna take
care of me just fine.

I know he will, honey.

I'd better get kicking.

Bye-bye.

Good morning.

My name is
Dr. Peter Morgan.

It's my first day here.

Lot 4. You got 30 minutes
for a verification.

After that, I'll have you towed.

Thanks a lot.

Hey, buddy.
You got a butt?

Hell, take the pack.

I quit.

Thanks.
Yeah.

<i>Look, I keep telling you,</i>

<i>we can't approve your eligibility</i>

<i>until we have complete proof
of disability.</i>

Next!
Wait wait wait, lady,

now, y'all lost my records eight
months ago when I transferred here.

Now, eight months, and you
still ain't found 'em.

Eight months and you been sending me
from one fucking desk to another,

telling me the same old bullshit!

In the meantime, I ain't
got no damn benefits.

How am I supposed to live?

Complete this
emergency-benefits form.

Lady, I done filled out
this damn form three times.

I ain't filling out no damn more and I
ain't moving till I get my benefits.

Sir, without certification,

we have no actual proof
that you're disabled.

You want proof?

You want proof?
All right, now, look.

I'll give you some damn proof.
You want some proof?

You need some proof? You
need some fucking proof?

Here's your goddamned proof!
Here's the motherfucking proof.

Get off your ass.

The goddamn proof right here.
There's some goddamn proof.

Outside, okay?
Now get your ass going and get me some...

Outside, okay?
Outside.

Come on, man! Take it easy.
Come on, man! Relax!

Yo yo yo, my man!

I'm sorry.
Watch out. Watch yourself.

I'm very sorry.
Watch yourself.

First-timer?
Yes.

Luther Jerome, first air cav,

and your best hope of survival
in this man's jungle.

Travis. Pat Travis.
Come on.

<i>What the hell is going on here, Luther?</i>

This is the v.A.,
soldier.

Now, the enemy is behind those desks.

They got the high ground and you're
crawling on your belly and out of ammo.

Now, you only got one chance,

the gospel according to Luther.

Whatever you need, you ain't gonna get.

And whatever you get, ain't worth shit.

I need a triple bypass.
Shit, forget it,

unless you got a congressman
in your pocket.

Otherwise, the only thing bypassed
around here is gonna be you.

Hey, baby, what's happening?

I need to know what you're talking about.

Where you been, bro, down on the farm?

Yeah.
The government's come up with a whole new disease

called the creeping cutback.
Hold up.

I'm listening.
Just a minute.

Just tell me, do I need a lawyer?

Hey, man!

Hold on. Look,

vets can't sue for government benefits.

That's been on the books
since the civil war.

Bet you never seen that in no
training film, did you, bro?

Carton of camels and a pizza.

Pepperoni, mushrooms, anything?

OK, man, you got it.
See you in half an hour.

Is there any way around this garbage?

There's always article 99.

What's that?

Jesus Christ.

Hi. My name is
Dr. Peter Morgan.

I was told to report here for processing.

Sara.

OK, Dr. Peter Morgan.

As of now, you work
for the federal government.

Filling out these forms properly

will probably be the most
significant thing

that you will accomplish during
your tenure at this hospital.

Do not, I repeat,

do not fuck them up, OK?

Your beeper number
is 2227-2227.

Dr. bobrick.
This new 'tern

is being assigned to your section.

OK.
What do you say?

Rudy bobrick.
Dr. Peter Morgan.

Welcome aboard.
Thank you.

You must be kidding
about all this paperwork.

Yeah, dump them anywhere.
Sturgess is operating.

Who's sturgess?

He's probably the best surgeon
in the whole goddamn system.

Come on.

Some system you got here.

Morning. Morning.
Everybody have breakfast?

<i>- Good morning, doctor.</i>
Man â™ª2:<i> Yes, doctor.</i>

Good. Then let's open
the chest.

Morning, Rudy.
Robin, hello.

Thank you, l.B.

Thanks.
Yeah. Question?

Yes,

Dr. sturgess,

why are we opening the patient's chest?

Because this patient has a four
centimeter aneurysm of his ventricle.

How else would you expect
me to get in there?

Not so many options,
what do you think, doctor?

Yes, but you see,

he was only scheduled
for prostate surgery.

<i>What's your name?</i>

My... my name is,
Dr. Felix stone, sir.

Look, Felix, I could tell you this
is a revolutionary technique,

going through his chest
to get to his prostate,

but you'd know I'd be full
of shit, wouldn't you?

Yes, sir.
<i>Wouldn't you?</i>

Here's the problem.

This patient needs
open-heart surgery.

The administration of this
hospital will only authorize

a prostate procedure.

Now, what good is fixing his prostate

if he has a heart attack
every time he tries to use it?

Right? Tell him, sid. Tell him the rule.

First the ventricles, then the testicles.

But for those of you who
have your heart set on it,

there'll be a prostate procedure

immediately following this one.
Everybody happy?

It's just that I thought
open-heart surgery was no longer,

you know, authorized, that's all.

Look, Felix,
we're here. He's here.

Why don't we make the most of this?
Right?

We can apologize to him once he
comes out of the anesthetic.

All right?

Since you're asking
all these hard questions,

I'm gonna let you make the first cut
this morning. Why don't you go scrub up?

No, thank you.

Anybody?

Rudy, they never want
to make the first cut.

No guts, no glory, sturg.

You the man.

All right, here we go.

Just you and I, sid.

Look, your case will be reviewed.

How long will that take?

Other people are waiting.

Eric!
Next.

Hi, my name is
Dr. Peter Morgan.

I was told to report here.

Have a seat. I'll let
him know you're here.

Thank you.

Stop panicking, Leo.
There's no provocation.

We're simply following
departmental guidelines.

Our directives are clear and unequivocal.

"Unless an illness
or injury is directly related

to the patient's military service, it
cannot be treated in a v.A. Facility."

Once we weed out all the ineligibles,

staff caseloads will be cut in two.

So just weed them out,
Leo, weed them out.

This excludes half our patients.

Send in Dr. Morgan,
please.

<i>Come in, Dr. Morgan.
Good to see you.</i>

Thank you.

I don't think you know Dr.
Krutz, our chief of medicine.

Welcome aboard.
Nice to meet you, sir.

Have a seat, Peter.

We're glad you were assigned to us.

I believe you want to
specialize in heart surgery.

Well, I'm planning on a private practice.

Good. Very good.

I admire a strong sense of ambition.

Thank you.

Some fine doctors
began their careers here.

Unfortunately, you are joining
us at a difficult time.

As you probably know,

we're facing a serious funding situation,

as well as shortages in other areas.

We're all gonna have to make some
hard choices in the coming months.

You're gonna find
your most essential skill

will be flexibility.

I'd call it ingenuity.

<i>Unfortunately, there are still
some people around here</i>

<i>who are fighting the new changes.</i>

But you won't have that problem

if you start out
with the right perspective.

Did I forget anything, Leo?

No.

Just, follow the rules.
You'll be all right.

It looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

Remember, Peter, my door's always open.

Thank you.
Good luck.

Thank you.

Good day.

Good boy.

<i>Dr. sinclair to admissions.</i>

<i>Dr. sinclair to admissions.</i>

You OK, pop?

I'm great, pal.

I just got to get in my truck and...

Head home to mama.

I can get that.
I got it.

Thanks.

Let's do it, pop.

Travis. Pat Travis.

Polaski's the name.
People call me shooter.

You a dodger fan?
No.

Not the Dodgers,

just Mickey hatcher.

The son of a bitch looks like a farmer,

and he never quits.

Yeah, kind of like Nolan Ryan.

Exactly like Nolan Ryan.

What are the pills for, pop?

I got a little trouble with the pump,

that's all.
What's your problem?

They call it post-traumatic
stress or some bullshit.

But they're taking care of it, right?

Yeah.

I just got myself an article 99.

Well, that's great.
Yeah.

"The veterans administration
is pleased to inform you"

<i>that you have been adjudged eligible</i>

<i>"for full and complete
medical benefits."</i>

<i>That's fabulous!</i>
Yeah.

"However, as the diagnosed condition"

cannot be specifically related

to your military service,

<i>treatment is not available at this time.</i>

<i>"Article 99."</i>

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Hello, "action news"?
Give me Ross Carter.

Ross, get down here right away, baby.

I got your lead-in
for tonight. Yeah!

Excuse me, girls, you done in here?
We've got a code red.

Got another loony on the loose.

I'll meet you guys
down in i.C.U.

Robin, show time, girl.

Sid, Robin, Rudy,
let's go. Come on.

Watch out!

Peter, grab this.
I'm getting hernia.

What the hell is going on?
No big deal, just guy with a rifle.

Drop drill!

OK, let's rock 'n' roll!

Yes, Denise,
I'm admitting a Mr. tenabe

as a voluntary psychiatric patient.

Yes, all right,
good. Thanks.

So, Mr. tenabe,
the nurse will meet you

right down here
and show you to your room.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

What's going on here? This is psychiatric.
What are you doing?

It's probably just another
patient going berserk.

Let me check... watch Mr. tenabe.
I'll be right back.

<i>Do you remember khe sanh?</i>

Do you remember hue city?

Do you remember the a shau valley?

Con thien?

Cu chi?

Cumberland?

Triple nickel?

Do you remember?

Do you remember?

<i>Kill for peace?</i>

What do you think you're doing?

Put that gun down right away!
You hear me?

Look at me when I'm talking...

Stay put or I'll staple
your ass to the ground.

Hey, look, look, if you
want to shoot someone,

shoot one of those bigwigs
upstairs, all right?

<i>They're the ones that...</i>

They're the ones that deserve it.

Is your head all right?

Yeah.

<i>What's your name?</i>

Sh... shooter.

<i>OK, shooter.</i>

You got a match?

Those things will kill you.

Look, here's the deal.

You get those bigwigs
to come downstairs here,

and then you got yourself
some important hostages,

and you let these civilians out of here.

All right, leave it to me.
I'm going to take care of it.

Why the fuck should I trust you?

This whole place is full of shit.

'Cause I'm still in this place
after seven fucking years.

That makes me even crazier
than you, believe me.

Are you actually instructing
this man how to take hostages?

What are you doing?
I told you to stay put!

Hostages are a temporary solution.

They are not gonna solve your problem.
Do you know that?

Fine. Would you like
some shock treatments?

I don't think he's interested.

Do you want me to have him
lie down here now

so you can discuss his
relationship with his mother?

He's a deranged individual.

You don't know what
you're dealing with, doctor.

Look, let's pretend
she does not exist, OK?

The media doesn't give diddly
squat about these little people.

What you gotta do now
is you gotta give them names.

Now, your best bet's gonna
be the executive director

and the chief of medicine.

You understand?

That's gonna get you
three major networks and c.N.N.,

maybe even "Oprah."

You are jeopardizing the lives
of innocent people here.

Shut the fuck up, lady!
Shut up the fuck up.

If you like your life... if you like
your life, you'll shut the fuck up!

Now shut the fuck up!
You hear me? Shut up!

It's all right. I'm just
gonna make the call.

Yeah.

Give me dreyfoos. Now.

<i>You've got the executive
director on the phone.</i>

It's your move.

Listen, these guys are tricky.

So remember,

no deals over the phone,

they come down here, and then you talk.

No deals.

You're not dicking with me, are you?

No. Here.

Come on.

Now.
Now now, Rudy!

OK, next batter. Anyone?

Let's get some oxygen over here!

All right, he's breathing.

He's breathing. Who's got the hypo?
Who's got the hypo?

Come on, stick him.
Stick him.

You got the oxygen?

Is that all right?
It's good. It's strong, real strong.

Code blue in the lobby outside!

Morgan, don't you just love this shit?

Take that.
Take it!

Boy can't get enough.
Check... check for any other casualties, OK?

Can do, sturg.
He's all yours, doctor.

What are you doing with that, Luther?

Don't worry, no gun, no weapons charge.

Go ahead. I'll take care of it.
Be cool, Luther.

Shit.

Come on.

Out of the way!

Get a gurney.
Get a gurney! Now!

Get out of the way!

Get it on him, sid.
Get it on him, sid.

<i>Get it on him, sid.</i>

Here we go.

<i>All right, come on.</i>

Come on. On his feet.
On his feet.

Come here! You you!
On his feet, let's go!

Come on! Come on!
Come on!

Ladies and gentlemen, please, now...

We'll issue a statement

as soon as we've had a chance
to assess the situation.

I'm sorry, I can't tell you
anything at this point.

You know as much as I do,

but as soon as I find something
out, you'll be the first to know.

Doctor, can you tell us what caused
that man to go on a rampage?

Keep depriving these patients of essential
medical services and what do you expect?

<i>The administration of this hospital</i>

is only concerned
with one thing... saving a buck.

Any more cutbacks, we're gonna
be operating out on the street.

Patients claim it's difficult
getting admitted, is that true?

Tell 'em to drive right in,
like everyone else.

Thank you, doctor. We got it.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

Get it off, Bob.
Let's get the blood gas.

Right, sid, intubate him.

OK, sturg.
There you go. There you go.

Get that blood gas.

All right, get him on the monitor.

Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there.

There you go.
Get it on. Get it on.

Now see what's going on.

All you, sturg.

All right,
he's in v-tach.

Robin, 75 milligrams of Lidocaine.
Let's start a drip.

<i>Right.</i>
Let me see the blood gas.

<i>I have it flowing here.</i>
Give him an amp of bicarb too.

Great. Thank you.
We're set. We're set.

You all right there, sid?

Yeah. We got it.

All right, everything under control?

<i>Good good good.</i>

OK, sid, it's all yours.
I'm gonna go take a leak.

Listen to me, next time you
treat a cardiac arrest,

make sure the first heart
you check is your own.

If it's still beating then you
go to work on the patient.

If not, you gotta get out of the way.

Okay?
Okay. Yeah.

Look, he... he's gonna
be okay, right?

How did the press
find out about this so fast?

I have no idea.

Who was that maniac with the gun?

Well, technically, he isn't even
a patient in this hospital.

He got upset because he
was issued an article 99.

Where is he now?

Upstairs in psychiatric,
he's in a locked ward.

Nobody makes any comments to the press

unless they clear it
through my office first.

We've gotta keep this from
being blown out of proportion.

Talk to them.

Emphasize that he wasn't even
a patient at this hospital.

He's a veteran, Henry.
What's the difference?

We're not responsible
for every lunatic out there

just because he once wore our uniform.

All right, can I have
your attention, please?

<i>Dr. bobrick, 4721.</i>

Are you nurse white?

Morgan.
Yeah.

Where the hell you been, 'tern?

We've been expecting you since noon.

Dr. sturgess asked me to
help with an emergency.

Now that you're here, replace the central
line on the patient in three. Now.

Three, shit.

Good morning.

<i>Hi.</i>
How are you doing?

I'm just gonna change
the central line here.

You might feel just a little jab, okay?

Shit! Help!

Help! Come on!

<i>Thump his chest!</i>

No! No!
Thump him!

<i>Hurry!
We're losing him!</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

Behind you, Robin.
The defib's ready.

Here.

No no. All quiet on the western front here.
Let's zap him.

OK, charge. Clear.

Come on, partner,
give me a little something.

What do you say? OK,
we got a heartbeat.

Baboom!

We're inside the 40, down to the 20.

Pay dirt!
Touchdown!

Let's give him a milligram
of atropine i.V.

And get ready to insert a pacemaker.

The idea's is to treat them
before they stop breathing.

I'm sorry.

Cardiac arrest, a ruptured artery...

This kid just may have talent.

It can't get worse than this.

Give it some time.
It's early.

Shit.

Hey, sid.
Hey, Rudy.

What do you say?

Dr. Morgan,
new admit, room two.

Before Christmas?
Jesus.

You've got to respect
something like that.

50 million years of evolution
to produce an ass like that.

Excuse me, Peter, listen, pal,

I hope you're not expecting this
kind of treatment all the time.

Everybody is just being nice
to you 'cause you're new.

I'm touched.

Is she flirting with me, or what?

I think she genuinely cares about you.

Shit.

Jesus Christ, Peter,
you almost killed someone.

Get your shit together.

OK, 'tern, let's go!

For the next 36 hours,
your buns belong to me.

Excuse me,
Mrs. Travis?

Yes.

Hi, I'm Dr. sturgess.

How bad is it, doctor?
Please, I need the truth.

Well, his condition is stable right now,

but he's gonna need bypass
surgery as soon as possible.

Mrs. Travis?

Everything's gonna be OK.

We'll take good care of him.

Thank you, doctor.

<i>- Can I see him?
No, not yet.</i>

<i>He needs some rest.</i>
Thank you.

How long you gonna
bullshit the lady, doc?

It'll be three weeks
just to get him admitted.

The man will be dead by then.

Luther, we'll figure something out.
Don't worry.

Who are you kidding?

He might as well start
donating his organs.

Hey.

About earlier today,
look, I'm really sorry.

I panicked and I freaked out.

Really, no need to explain.

You know, I'm trying to apologize to you.

As long as we're gonna
be working together,

I think, maybe you could start thinking
about getting a better attitude.

You won't be here long enough.

No?
Where am I going?

Does that mean you're not planning

to accelerate your internship?

Cut your research year
and take early boards?

So now you read palms?

Am I wrong?

Okay,

so what do I do after my boards?

<i>Surgical residency
in a prestige hospital,</i>

then partnership in
a little money-making setup

somewhere in Connecticut
or Beverly hills.

<i>Did I leave anything out?</i>

No, that sounds good to me.

You got me all figured out.

Yeah.

The sky's the limit, doctor.

Please!

<i>- They broke in again,
Rudy.</i>

Beg your pardon?
They broke in again.

What were they looking for?

<i>Anything to hang us with.</i>

Today, I committed the unpardonable sin.

I went public with the
administration's dirty laundry.

This is some place.

I've got to get
Travis into the O.R.

What are you so worried about Travis for?

I mean, we've got a floor
full of patients,

and we can't get clearances
to operate on any of them.

Rudy,

what have you got?

<i>Here we go, sturg.</i>
What x-rays do you have? What could we use?

I can get you a gall bladder, pancreas,

maybe a loose herniated
disk, you know, a lung...

Even if we got the clearances,
which we do not,

we don't have anything to operate with.

All right, then you know what?
What?

It's time to institute emergency
procedures here then. That's what.

Would you be talking about
<i>the</i> midnight procedure?

Forget it, Rudy.
Yes, its time to do a midnight.

I'm trying to be serious here.

Fucking-a.
Let's go. Come on.

I'll meet you down there.

Come on, we're going do
a midnight requisition.

Peter.

You guys have been here too long.
You need a vacation.

Look, you're welcome to come
along with us if you want.

No, my record's nice and clean.

I think I'll try and keep it that way.

All right.
Suit yourself.

I usually do.

Hey, sturgess!

I was wondering, did you ever
want anything else besides this?

There's something else besides this?

I hope so.

I sure hope so.

Code blue.
We're on our way.

Yeah, we've got intruders
in the basement.

There can't be a code blue.

There ain't no patients down there.

Just check it out, all right?

Great!

Holy Christ.

<i>Sturg?</i>
What?

How come we gotta operate
with spare parts,

and these chimpan-fucking-zees
get all the new ones?

I don't know.
I guess they vote republican.

We hit the lottery...
<i>- What did you get?</i>

Pacemakers.

Look at that.
That's beautiful.

Tying off there and contaminate it.

Strip.
No, why me?

Why is it always me?
Why do I have to strip?

You see someone else built
like a corpse? Strip.

Strip, bobrick.

If you'd call me by my first name,

you'd get a lot further
in these kind of affairs.

We back there again?

Listen!

Let's go.

Stick your head down!

Contaminated.

Get back. Get back.
Get back.

<i>Contaminated stuff.</i>

Very dangerous.
Very dangerous.

That was good. That was good. Way to go.

Good. Good.

Nothing like male bonding.

Come on, wait wait.
OK OK OK,

so we had a little
professional misunderstanding.

A professional misunderstanding!

You made me look like a complete idiot.

You totally disregarded
my expertise, doctor.

I got it.
I got the door. I got the door.

I got it.

Come on, I'm not gonna bite you.

What are you doing here in psych, anyway?

What's your name?

Denise, take this, take this, quick.
It's killing me.

They didn't have potato salad. I'm sorry.

Diana.
Dr. walton.

Look, Dr. walton,

I don't know what kind
of expertise you have...

I ran a
substance-abuse center.

Isn't that good enough for you, doctor?

Substance abuse?
Yes, would you get the door, please?

Sure. Of course.
Well, that's great.

But how... how much
moonlighting have you done?

What?

How many emergency rooms have you been in

at 3:30 in the morning with
some zonked out guy on p.C.P.,

coming at you with a broken bottle?

What difference does that make?

You almost killed that guy today.

Stop it.
"Killed him."

I stunned him for a couple seconds.

You must be quite a surgeon.

What do you use as an
anesthetic, the electric chair?

Don't you think that we should
at least work this out?

As a matter of professional courtesy?

Professional courtesy, like, "don't
move, or I'll nail you to the floor"?

I said, "staple your ass
to the ground."

Don't get dramatic.

Let me pass, doctor.

Thank you.

This is nice.

Maybe we should go somewhere
and work this out,

deal with this attraction.

They broke into my lab again last night,

stole all my pacemakers.

We know all about it, doctor.

I have a snow monkey

that's been waiting three
months for a valve transplant.

My chimps are becoming flaming neurotics.

They were seen.

The thieves were wearing
surgical masks and gowns.

We know who it was.
Sturgess.

Really?

Was there
a positive i.D.?

No.

We've tried everything. We've
tried threats, suspension.

They're not gonna testify against him.

Until somebody does, we don't
have a case, do we, Leo?

Without a positive identification,

I can't take him in front of a
medical review board, can I?

His luck won't last forever.

OK 'tern, let's hustle.

You got Abrams in two and a
staff meeting in half an hour.

Let's get it up and get it moving!

What a bitch.

Mr. Abrams?

<i>Yeah?</i>

Good morning.

My name is Dr. Morgan.
I'm here to examine you.

It's a waste of time, kid.

I've been examined more times

than you got wrinkles on your nuts.

Well, I can't seem to find your files,

so why don't you put that down there.

Let's just open up your shirt.

Jesus.

Why don't you tell me if this hurts.

Yeah, it hurts.
It hurts.

No, I'm kidding.
Let's sit you up here.

Why don't you go find me a real doctor?
He'll know what to do.

You're still wet behind the ears.

Mr. Abrams,
I am a real doctor.

Yeah?

How come you don't know shit?

Peter? Peter!

Come here.
Peter, that's a gomer.

We don't treat gomers.
Didn't anybody tell you that?

What's a gomer?

That's short for "get that mummy
out of my examination room."

Didn't they teach you nothin'
in medical school, 'tern?

Don't forget that c.B.C.
On richetti, okay?

<i>Do I ever?</i>
Come on, let's go.

Wait a second. What do you
want me to do with him?

We gotta wrap him up and turf him out.
Let's go. Let's go.

Hey, wait a second, wait a second.

What do you mean?
We're not treating him?

Listen,

the treatment they
authorize, he doesn't need.

They won't authorize
the treatment that he does,

so the idea is to keep him
here until they finally do.

You understand?
OK, fine.

Where do I turf him?

Podiatry. Neurology.
What's the difference?

Just as long as you get him out of there.
We need that bed.

Look, we don't do this
because we like it.

If we keep him moving,
he won't be discharged,

then he won't die in some
rooming house somewhere.

You can't turf him forever.

Eventually, he's just
gonna come right back to us.

That's why it's gonna take all
your skill as a physician

to make sure he doesn't get
back before the weekend.

This guy doesn't even have any records.

<i>If he had records, then
we'd have to treat him.</i>

<i>They don't want us to do that.</i>

Listen, as far as this hospital is
concerned, gomers do not exist.

If they did, the whole
system would break down.

<i>All right, don't try to figure it out.</i>

<i>When you have any doubts,
just turf the patient.</i>

All right, and don't worry about it.

We all had to go
through this at one time.

We all did it.
It's okay. Just do it.

<i>- Learn anything,
kid?</i>

I think.

Don't think.

That's dangerous.
It's very dangerous.

Only gets you into deeper trouble.

Gastro is our best bet, believe me.

Order a g.I. Series.

Dr. sturgess
said you wanted me.

Yes.

I need to order a complete
workup for Mr. Abrams.

I need to order
a g.I. Series. Now.

See you later, Vicky.

<i>See you, handsome.</i>

<i>Morning.</i>

<i>As most of you know, one of our
most important research facilities</i>

<i>was broken into this morning.</i>

What some people refer to
as a "midnight requisition"

is, in fact, a serious
violation of federal law.

<i>Also,</i>

<i>as I went through
the corridors this morning,</i>

<i>I counted numerous violations
of this hospital's dress code.</i>

Your appearance says everything
about this hospital.

Chinese.

<i>If we may continue?</i>

Excuse me.

<i>Sacrifices are being made in
every government department,</i>

<i>including crucial areas
of defense spending.</i>

This is a critical period
in our nation's history

and we're asking all of you
for your cooperation.

They wouldn't deliver.

I'd like to share something with you.

Would you come out here, please?

Stand here.

I had these items sifted out of disposal.

From this moment on, every
department without exception

will account for each item

of its supply issue.

What?
He wants us to count sheets of toilet paper.

Well, you gotta remember, Washington
has a right to know these things.

At the end of each month, a
special inventory will be taken.

This is a blowup of the form and
samples have been passed out.

Any excess above the allotted amount

will be deducted from your
department's operating budget.

I have a question for you.

I'm sure you do.

So, while we're

measuring adhesive tape

and counting q-tips,

who's gonna take care of the patients?

Or do they just get eliminated
from the operating budget

along with the other waste?

I think we can adjourn.
Thank you.

OK.
Peter, how's Travis holding up?

There have been
no more episodes of v-tach

and his sinus rhythm has
been normal for 24 hours.

<i>- Dr. rothman, 4721.
Dr. rothman, 4721.</i>

Excuse me,

what are you doing with his records?

Arranging for his discharge, doctor,

first thing tomorrow morning.

This patient cannot be moved.

The decision has already been made.

If you have a complaint, why not
take it up with the director?

What if we just order a
full medical review?

Come on, Rudy, that takes six months.

We can't gomer this guy.
He's been discharged already.

He's not leaving this hospital.

We'll hide him or something,
but he's not leaving.

Hide him? Hide him where?
I have a great idea,

a linen closet, supply closet.

Laundry room, nobody will ever
look in the laundry room.

Great idea.
Wait wait. Who's this?

Taking Mr. ponzini
down to pathology.

<i>Ponzini?</i>

<i>- It's one of O'Brian's.
Casualties.</i>

This guy's going up for
"butcher of the year." O'Brian.

He screwed up again?
Dangerously close

<i>to "most kills by a doctor
in a major hospital."</i>

Boy.
Bye.

Wait.

Ponzini.

Hello, Mr. forest.

The patient was admitted with pain
in the lower thoracic cavity,

projectile vomiting,
and viscous steatorrhea.

Dr. Nelson?
Pulmonary edema.

No.

Dr. fields?

I'd say a pulmonary embolus.
No.

<i>The patient is suffering from a
superior mesenteric insufficiency,</i>

resulting in a loss of blood
to the lower colon,

necrosis,

and a steatorrheic stool.

That happens to be correct.

Yes, I know.

Did you have a nice weekend?

Good.

You sent a gomer up to gastro.
He never arrived.

Better get your ass in gear and find him.

Just one goddamn minute, nurse.
I am a doctor...

You ain't gonna be here long enough

to "just-one-goddamn-minute"
me, 'tern.

When you and all them
other trainees is long gone,

I will still be standing right here,

on this floor, in these shoes.

And don't you forget it!

No calls.

That was quite a performance
this morning.

You never get tired of trying to ridicule

the administration
of this hospital, do you?

Which is difficult to understand,

considering someone with your record.

My record?

What record are you talking about?

You've managed to amass quite
a list of accomplishments

in the five years I've been here.

Forgery of unauthorized requisitions.

I thought it'd be good
to start using anesthesia

during operations, don't you?

Ineligible patients treated
with unauthorized procedures

against express orders to the contrary.

Defying administrative
directives and staff bulletins.

"Defying staff bulletins."
Now we're getting serious?

You don't know how serious.

<i>Any one of these charges
could finish you in medicine.</i>

If you could prove them.

Why do you refuse to accept reality?

<i>I have directives to follow.</i>

You not only follow them, you
go them one better, don't you?

I operate this hospital in the
best interest of our patients,

not some hotshot doctor
with an ego problem.

This hospital operates your own.

Personally, I think you're a disgrace

to the profession of medicine,

and a detriment to the running
of this hospital.

If the regulations hadn't been made

to protect fools and incompetents like
you, I'd have fired you long ago.

You know, I want you to know
what an inspiration you are.

You'll never know how many
times I said to myself,

"quit. Go into
private practice.

"I don't need this shit." But
you always change my mind.

See, you're not just another bureaucrat

using these poor bastards to wriggle
your little ass up the ladder.

You're a whole new species.

<i>See, you actually think you're
doing a service for this country</i>

<i>every time you refuse one
of these guys an operation.</i>

You think the priorities are cutting
the budget and trimming costs,

instead of easing
the suffering and the anxiety

of the people that
this place was built for.

<i>You know what the most amazing thing is?</i>

You don't even know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

Washington.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

I'm looking for one of my patients.

I can't seem to find him.

I think he might have been
transferred here by mistake.

His name is Abrams.
He's a gomer.

Check inside, they're all in there.

Thank you.

Mr. Abrams?
Mr...

My god.

There must be some kind of mistake here.

What's in the bag,
Mr. Thomas?

Hey, Randy, where are you going?

<i>Doctor. Doctor.</i>
What? What?

They're all being discharged.

Mr. tenabe's
on the list.

Yes, Dr. walton
in psychiatric.

I need to speak to the chief immediately.

My patients are being discharged
without authorization and...

she hung up on me.

<i>Diana? Diana?</i>

Welcome to general hospital
where each day we demonstrate

how much easier it is to run
a hospital without patients.

I don't need any of your
fucking jokes right now.

<i>What are you doing here, doctor?</i>

I've come to give you a few lessons

in Dr. sturgess's course
on basic survival.

Do you always talk like a complete idiot?

Look at this.

My patients can't survive on the outside.

You've got to turf them out.

I can't turf them.
It's against regulations.

<i>Dr. walton,</i>

<i>do you want your patients in here,</i>

<i>or do you want them out on the street?</i>

Well, what do you think?

<i>Either you screw the regulations,</i>

<i>or these regulations are gonna screw you.</i>

You don't have much time.

Here.
Turf 'em.

<i>Nurse daoust, 614.</i>

<i>Nurse daoust.</i>

Who's in there?
Mr. ponzini.

Ponzini?
Yes, ma'am.

Mr. ponzini died
two days ago, you idiot!

What is he doing in there?
Why wasn't he removed?

I'm gonna check into that
right away, ma'am.

Incompetence!

My god!

Mayday!

<i>Mayday! Ponzini! Mayday!</i>
Let's go.

Nurse white!

Where are you, nurse white?

Get out of my way.
Get out of my way!

Hand me those patient charts.

I want Mr. ponzini's
records.

Mr. ponzini.

Well, where is he?
Where is it then?

Where is his chart?
That is not Mr. ponzini!

Where is he?
What room?

<i>Room 543.
Why is there...</i>

<i>- The patient in 543 has been.
Transferred to pathology.</i>

<i>He is alive!</i>

Come with me!
Come with me!

When I find out who's
responsible for this,

it will be their last day
in this hospital!

Will you please get out of the way?

I'm telling you, I saw
him transferred myself.

He is alive!
Now...

You tell me this man is dead.

Well,

he ain't gonna be needing his lunch.

There we go.

Good.

Okay, there we go.

Okay, Mr. paithe. On your
back for four hours, please.

It was good.

Nice needlework, nice and clean.

You'll be taking over for me pretty soon?

Yeah.

Hey, wait a second.
I gotta talk to you.

What is it?

Do you have a problem with me?

Is it my work or something?

No. I think you'll make
a very good doctor.

I was wondering maybe... maybe
we could have a cup of coffee

or something sometime.
I don't think so.

Why is it every time you look at me,

you like as though I've got
something you're afraid to catch?

I could never catch what you've got.

Well, maybe it's just what you need.

Look,

I've seen hotshots like you come and go,

with your frat-house grins and your
option on a suite of fancy offices.

All you have to do is stop by
here for a couple of years,

and practice up on some
poor beaten-down bastards

who can't go to a malpractice
attorney every time you screw up.

Have you ever bothered to take a
real look at the men in these rooms,

or stop to figure out
what's really going on here?

Or am I stupid to think it could
possibly matter to someone like you?

Look, I don't know who
you've got me confused with,

but you sure as hell
aren't talking about me.

I'd appreciate if you
stopped giving me this shit.

Thanks. I'll remember
not to do it again.

<i>Bad day, kid?</i>

Mr. Abrams?

What are you doing here? I've
been looking all over for you.

Idiots made a mistake.
They sent me to urology.

I've been peeing my brains out.

This place is so screwed up.

It's like a war going on in there.

War...

Tell me about it, kid.

You know where
I was on d-day?

Where?

<i>Omaha beach.</i>

That was the biggest
screw-up in history.

<i>Let me tell you a secret, kid.</i>

I was so scared,

I took a dump in my pants.

That plus two bullets through my helmet,

I lost half my platoon.

By the time we made it off that beach,

<i>I had a medal stuck on my chest and
my face was in "stars and stripes."</i>

Now somehow I made it through,
and you will too.

I don't think so.

Doctors, I've seen them come and go.

You've got the stuff.
You'll make it, kid.

Hey, I've been looking for you.
What are your orders, doctor?

Why don't you give us a second?

I'll be at the desk.

What the hell am I gonna do?

Your best bet is screw up a lumbar
puncture and shoot me down to ortho.

That should be good for two weeks.

No, I can't do that.

Don't get excited, kid.

Use the Alzheimer's scam.
It's foolproof.

<i>I'm gonna send him up to neurology.</i>

Cat scan.
Suspected a-l-z.

You got it.

Who are you? I don't know who you are.
What floor is this?

<i>Take care of him, okay?</i>

<i>Dr. Carter, O.R. three.</i>

<i>Dr. Carter, O.R. three.</i>

Forget it.
No way.

Look, I'm not moving until you admit him.

I'm telling you we're full up.
Turf him somewhere else.

There is nowhere else.
That's not my problem.

Have you looked at his chart?
Have you even checked his chart?

Do you think you're the first doctor
to ever turf somebody around here?

Who told you we had a free bed?

I did.

<i>Nurse,</i>

<i>put the patient in 214.</i>

<i>Dr. walton...</i>
You owe me, buddy.

Thank you.

All right, you know this is
just temporary, Mr. tenabe.

And I'm going to come by and see you
every couple of hours, whenever I can.

I'm gonna come back around
2:00 and check on...

You don't have to... to hold him.
He can just walk.

<i>Dr. walton,
report to radiology.</i>

Give him a milligram
of morphine and an E.K.G.

Sturg, we got trouble in turf city.

Get me out of here!

No no no!
No needles!

Get away.
Get away from him.

They want to hurt me!

No no no. We're not
gonna hurt you.

It's the only way to keep
you in the hospital, frank.

If they don't perform the X-ray,
I'll have to discharge you

and they'll send you back.
Do you want that?

No.
Okay okay. Now, frank,

what you're gonna do you're gonna
put your hands by your side.

Kathleen, Kathleen, get in here!
Kathleen's gonna take care of you.

Guys, do it quick. Do it quick.

I'm right here, frank.

<i>Your arms at your side.</i>

<i>Take a deep breath</i>

<i>and hold it.</i>

You look like you could use a drink.

I can't leave the hospital.

Who said you have to leave the hospital?

Sorry, there's no ice.

No problem.

Cheers.
Cheers.

I liked the way that
you handled that patient.

Look, ma, no defibrillators.

So you left substance abuse for this?
Yeah.

How come?

I just got tired

of those
six-figure executives

bitching about what a bummer life is.

I thought I would come down here and
see what the real world was like.

You found out.

Big time.

At least you're over the hard part, though.
<i>You think?</i>

Yeah.
I hope so.

That's good.

I think what you need is another drink.

I think what I need is to get laid.

Excuse me?

You don't have a hearing problem, do you?

No.

I'm sorry.

Did I get the wrong impression?

No no no.

It just isn't exactly the way I...

What I expected
is... is all.

You expected...

What?

More romance?

Shall I go out and get
a candle or something?

No.
May i...?

I got a candle.

I was hoping for something
a little larger.

Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!

Go ahead and walk that
walk, girl, but listen,

I hear they got teddies on
sale down at j.C. Penney.

Red lace. Eat your
heart out, Luther.

<i>Listen, don't you hurt nobody!</i>

Good morning,
Mrs. mcguinnes.

My name is Maggie.
Nurse Jones is off today,

so I'm gonna be giving you your
bath before surgery. Okay, Loretta?

You don't mind if I call
you Loretta, do you?

Shit!

That's why you like me, baby.

The shit is steaming.

Yes yes. Mrs. mcguinnes in 345.
What about her?

What?
I'll be right there.

Rudy!
What?

Mayday! Mayday!

Quick!

Sid!

Mayday!
This is it!

Mayday.
Let's go. Come on.

You got it.

There he is.

Travis.
How you doing?

Now, wait a minute, baby.
Get out of my way, Luther.

Hold on. I got a complaint.
And I've got an emergency!

You're not going anywhere until
you listen to what I have to say.

I am ordering you to get out of my way!

Damn, I love that
come-get-me look

you get in your eye when you get mad.

Cut out the crap, Luther!
No!

Put me down!
Luther!

I live to rocket down these halls.

Let's go!

Stop or I'll call an orderly!

Bring that patient back here immediately!

Put me down, Luther!

I don't know, I just...

Hello,
Dr. walton.

I'll talk to you later.

Okay.

How are you?
Fine. How are you?

Good. How did you sleep last night?

Good.
Speaking of great.

Fine.

Was last night, like, just good therapy,

or was it something else?

Because if it was something
else, I really think

that we should maybe
consider adjoining offices...

I gotta go.
Thanks for these.

Diana, wait a second.
Wait a second.

You didn't answer me.
Don't just walk away.

Look,

we were both pretty
stressed out last night.

We needed some...

Human contact. But I think, from now on,

I'd prefer to keep our relationship
on a professional footing.

Excuse me,<i> Dr.</i> walton?

Hi.

Excuse me. Do you mind, we're in
the middle of a consultation.

What're you doing?
What are you doing?

This is ridiculous. What
do you think you're doing?

Listen, I hate to tell the lady
that she's bullshitting herself,

but you're bullshitting yourself.
Really?

If all you needed was human contact, then
you could have gone to an a.A. Meeting.

We had a lot more than just contact.
Come here.

<i>- You know, when I first.
Went in the army,</i>

<i>none of the uniforms fit.</i>

So I... I went to a tailor.
A good tailor.

He cut it so I had
a pinched-in waist.

All the girls went
crazy over me, I'll tell ya.

Anyway, this is my album,

and the first picture
in the album is a horse.

I don't ride, but it's
just that I love horses.

This is

when we first landed in north Africa.

It was dirty, hot, Sandy.

I had a desk job then.

I even started smoking a pipe

because I thought it'd make
me look more distinguished.

Schmuck.

Heh.

We traveled a lot and...

Now this one.

This is when we first liberated
a little town in France.

They billeted me with a Baker.

Guess what you smelled in this house.

Bread.
Bread.

Bread all over the damn place.

I tell ya, I woke up in the morning
with the smell of bread...

He had this gorgeous daughter.

She baked the most fantastic croissants.

What a piece of ass.

What happened?

I married her.
That's what happened.

<i>Where is she now?</i>

She died about 10 years ago.

I'm... I'm sorry.

Let's see what else we got.

I like this.

<i>That's my old army hat.</i>

Where did you come up
with all this stuff?

<i>Patient's effects.</i>

It's a silver star, isn't it?

I was kinda worried about you, kid.

But you're OK.

<i>Dr. Morgan, report
to the director's office.</i>

<i>Dr. Morgan.</i>

<i>- That's right.
A whole new shipment.</i>

A complete cardiac unit.

<i>Enough for at least
10 surgical procedures.</i>

<i>Wait, just a moment.</i>

Who's out there?

<i>Dr. Morgan, sir.</i>

Close the door, please.

Tell Morgan I'll be right with him.

What? No no.
Of course not.

I've had it stored in pathology.

Good.

Send Dr. Morgan in,
please.

You wanted to see me?

<i>Have a seat, doctor.</i>

<i>I see you're settling
into our routine very nicely.</i>

Thank you.

What I wanna say is off the record.

There are gonna be

some radical changes
around here very soon.

I'm putting together a whole new team.

It can be a very big opportunity.

But before that happens, I'll
be forced to get rid of certain

dysfunctioning elements.

<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

Not exactly.
No.

I need someone willing
to supply me with evidence

of all the violations
being committed around here.

In strictest confidence, of course.

You expect me to spy for you?

<i>I don't expect anything, doctor.</i>

Whatever action you take must be because

you feel it's in the best
interests of this hospital.

<i>I expect you to do what is correct.</i>

Think it over.

<i>Yes?</i>

How are you feeling?

Afraid I'm gonna live, doc.

You feel all right?
I'm good, yeah.

I heard you were racing
around on wheelchairs before.

Yeah, I want to get in a league.

The wheelchair league?

<i>Hey, I'm sorry that we had to
put you down here in this room.</i>

<i>Hell.
Lots of sheets.</i>

<i>Lots of sheets.
A lot of room.</i>

Don't you worry about a thing.

I'm not going till you go.
Okay.

His lungs are full of fluid.
He's had persistent angina.

I started a nitro drip.

Without surgery, I don't think
he's going to last another month.

Hey, sturg, Robin.
Hi. Hi, guys.

You hear that wolin's got a new shipment
for his "bedtime for bonzo" experiments?

You believe it?
Pathology...

They put the stuff meant to
save lives in with the corpses.

Of course, we're never gonna
check inside the stiffs, are we?

Where did you get this information?

Totally unreliable source.

I believe it.

Sturg, do we go?

Do we have a choice?

Tonight.
Let's do it.

<i>Hey, sturg.</i>

<i>Do you know one thing
I hate about pathology?</i>

What?
Nobody ever says thank you.

Yeah, but when was the
last time anyone down here

brought an action for malpractice?

It's an interesting point.
Well, yeah. Very interesting. The only thing is

a lot of people are down here
as a result of malpractice.

Come on.

What's with you two today?

Nothing.
He's just trying...

Hey hey.
Stop.

Gentlemen, check over there...

Did you check?
I checked.

Nothing in number two.
Number two.

It's ponzini.

This is it.
Pay dirt!

Sturg, we hit the jackpot.

Sturg, bring the bag!

<i>Bring the bag.</i>

You wanted to see me?

Yeah. Whose x-rays
are these?

They're Abrams'.

It's not an option.
Forget it.

Wait a second, if we can help Travis,

why can't we help Abrams?

Because I can give Travis 20 more years.

The only thing I can give
Abrams is this hospital.

So, what, you get to decide
who gets to live and die?

Anytime you want the job.

That's bullshit.

You're right.

<i>Doctor?</i>

The director wants
to see you immediately.

<i>- You ignored.
All my warnings</i>

<i>and now you've taken your
friends down with you.</i>

<i>Which is too bad,</i>

<i>considering what promising
careers they might have had.</i>

<i>They looked up to you.</i>

<i>You were their hero.</i>

<i>Let's just cut the bullshit, OK?</i>

<i>What do you want?</i>

I want you to place yourself
under voluntary suspension.

How can I do that?

I have patients I'm taking care of.

Those are my terms.

<i>First, I want that tape.</i>

All right? Then I want
a written agreement

exempting handleman and bobrick

from any and all repercussions.

<i>Good.</i>

<i>One more thing, doctor.</i>

When you go before
the medical review board,

you'll plead guilty to each of
the charges I bring against you.

<i>Then you may have your tape
and my letter of agreement.</i>

Now why don't you get out?

I got some real doctors to talk to.

What are you doing?
Dr. sturgess placed himself on voluntary suspension

as of 12:00 noon today.

Sturg? Sturg?

<i>What's going on?</i>

<i>Where are you going?</i>

What, something happened upstairs?
Get something on you or what?

I just gotta get out of here and
forget this place ever existed.

Yeah, but what are we gonna tell
the staff and all those interns

you're turning into doctors
instead of stockbrokers?

Just tell them to lay low.

Follow the directives,

you know? Let the guy think he's won.

Come on, sturg.
That's bullshit.

<i>- Sturg, can I.
Ask you a question?</i>

<i>It's always a little foggy to me.</i>

Let's just play guess your best.

Tell me if I'm...
Yes, no, maybe-so here.

So in other words you're gonna
take yourself a little break,

just walk away from the hospital.

And they're gonna take a look around,

see if the coast is clear, no more sturg,

then they drop their Dukes.

<i>And then, bingo, you waltz right back in,</i>

<i>and we're back in business?</i>

They finally got you, doc?

Look, is there anything we can do?

No no, it's best to stay out of this one.

You sure?

I appreciate it,
though. Thanks.

You hold down the fort, okay?

Okay.
All right, I'll see you around.

Hey, take care?
Yep.

Nurse white?
Excuse me.

I just completed
Mr. Simpson's exam.

He needs these tests run.

I told you once:

We don't treat agent orange cases.

I know, but... - you would know
this if you read your regs.

And your gomer's back.

So what's wrong?

It's the end of the line, doc.

They got no place else to send me.

Come on, we can always
run the old a-l-z scam.

No no. Don't forget,
we pulled that one twice.

It's time to pull the plug.

Come on, Sam. Don't talk like that.
It's not funny.

Come here.

Why don't we shut off all this crap?

Only one little air bubble,

right there
beside the i.V...

Come on, Sam, you know I can't do that.

But nobody's gonna know.
Nobody, doc.

I will.
What the hell's the answer, doc?

<i>You can't do nothing for me.</i>

<i>I can't go round and round
this hospital forever, can I?</i>

I'm sick of living
on the i.V.

<i>Mr. Abrams, you're not
going to have to.</i>

We're gonna run some tests...

<i>I don't want your tests.</i>

I hate those goddamn tests.

<i>Believe me, this is
better for both of us.</i>

Here, take this. I got
nobody else to give it to.

Take it.

Sam, you keep this.

Look, everything's gonna be all right.

Okay, doc. I'll be all right.
I'll be okay.

Yeah. Okay.

Look,

I'll be back in a minute.
We'll have a chat.

Right. Right.

Hey.
Why did you leave just like that?

Without saying anything?
Why didn't you call me?

I was gonna call you.

You got the staff worked up
enough to go out and riot,

<i>and you're sitting here playing dropout?</i>

I'm not playing dropout.
I'm burnt out, is what I am.

That's not good enough. What about all those
people who went out on a limb for you?

<i>What about your patients?</i>

And what about Dr. sturgess'
course on basic survival?

Are you walking out on that too?

Diana, I really don't need this now.

Yeah, well, what do you need right now?

You come into my life,
you come tearing into my life,

you make me give a damn
about what happens to you,

and then you slam the door in my face.

I'm not slamming any door.
I'm telling you the truth.

I don't believe you.
I don't believe

you ever got close enough to
anybody to tell them the truth.

I don't need to be analyzed now.
I really don't.

Is that what you think this is?

If that's what you think
this is... god damn it.

Wait a minute, Diana.
Wait a minute.

Look, you can't trust me
enough to tell me the truth.

Jesus Christ. Let's just
call it quits right now.

We'll just cut our losses and say adios.

Goodbye, Dr. sturgess, it
could have been really good.

Do you know that?
No no no, wait a minute.

All right, I need you, OK?

I need you.

I really need to talk.

Nurse?
What is it?

I need a favor. I need to turf a
patient down from the 4th floor.

Is that your patient in bed 7?

Yeah, I'll be right there.
I think he's dead.

What?

I think he's dead.

Sam?

Sam?

One, two, three.

Sam!

Come on.

Aw, Sam.

Sam!

I couldn't even do that for you.

Please forgive me.

God damn it!

Come to collect your gomer, doctor.

This man won a silver star, you know?

That makes him a hero.

<i>It doesn't make him a gomer.
You understand?</i>

You better treat him as well
as you treat your father,

so help me god, or I'll break your neck.

Rodney,

I'll take care of this.

Nurse white,

I want you to run these tests.
I want you to run them now.

I don't give a shit about your
policies or your regulations.

If I hear one word from you,
I swear to you,

I will bring you up on charges.

What are you waiting for?

Sam.

<i>- Before we begin.
Our regular meeting,</i>

<i>would each department present
its inventory forms, please?</i>

<i>Just pass them all up.</i>

Is there a problem, doctor?

Problem?

No problems.

Good.

Thank you. Thank you all
for your cooperation.

Now...

You're gonna make it.

I know you're gonna make it.

I think maybe I should have
taken those hostages,

doc?

Excuse me, Mr. polaski.

Son of a bitch.

Can I help you, doctor?

I found the camera you hid

to set up sturgess.

You used me.

You had the choice
of using what you heard.

You just made the wrong decision.

I believe some sort of
disciplinary action is necessary,

since you've broken into my office.

What are you doing?

I don't know,

but I bet you there would
be a lot of people

interested in seeing this tape.

Why doctors have got to steal medical
supplies from their own goddamn hospitals

so that they can
keep their patients alive.

You know, I... I think
the TV networks

really should take a look at this.
What do you think?

Go ahead.
Show it.

We can always add your name to the list
of people being brought up on charges.

Yeah.

<i>Go through that door
and you can say goodbye</i>

<i>to ever doing anything
significant in medicine.</i>

There's always your job, sir.

You want me to get that?

Yeah.
All right.

Hey.
Is sturgess in?

Yeah.

Thanks.

Sorry for calling on you so late.

I just thought you'd like to see this.

It's called "three men
in a pathology lab."

The dialogue sucks, but
the action's pretty good.

Peter, where did you get this?

Dreyfoos's office.

Has anybody else seen this?

The lines are around the block.

I thought you were leaving us
for Beverly hills, Peter.

Well, my plans got changed.
I was suspended this morning.

You got suspended?
<i>Yeah.</i>

You're starting to make progress, doctor.
Have a seat.

Look, I don't have a lot of time.

I just came by to tell you that
everybody wants you to come back.

Do they realize the risk they're
running to their careers?

I mean this is very serious.

Well, we know that we want to
run the hospital with you,

or there's, not gonna be much
of a hospital left to run.

We've got enough food for a week,

have gasoline for the backup generators.

My man in the media is on the case.

And we've got enough brothers
to hold off a division.

Sturg, it's good to have you back.

I got Ellis and McCarthy
prepped and ready for us now.

All right, great great.

We're going to get Travis now.

No, let's hold off on Travis.

I don't wanna really move him yet.

So we'll schedule him
for a little later on.

Now listen, are you sure
you guys wanna do this?

Sturg, come on, we're back in business
here, pal. Let's rock 'n' roll.

Okay, let's go, let's go.

<i>Hey!</i>

Where is he?
In the first bed.

Excuse me!
Grant.

First bed.
How you doing, Mr. Grant?

Can you please tell me
what's going on here?

Yeah, it's an earthquake drill.

Earthquake drill?

See ya up on 3.
We ain't got no earthquakes here!

Just a minute, where do
you think you're going?

This patient is
reserved for the O.R.

Not if we get there first.

Stop! Stop!

I'll put you on report
for this, do you hear me?

What the hell is going on?

Dr. sturgess,

<i>just what do you think you're you doing?</i>

Practicing medicine.
What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Semiannual clearance, doctor.
Everything's half price.

No no.
Come on. Come on.

<i>Let go.</i>

I want you off the floor.
You're suspended.

You're not allowed to touch a patient.
Back off!

Okay, that's it.

I want everyone out of here.

I want everyone off of this floor.

All good?
Yeah.

All right, let's staple him up and
get ready for the next one then, OK?

<i>Attention, all security.</i>

<i>Report to the nearest exit immediately</i>

<i>and take up positions outside.</i>

Red lion to all checkpoints.

Stand by.

What are you doing?
Hey!

Hey! Hey!

Open the door.

Damn!

Copo like a mofo.

Listen to me.

I want every security guard
out in front when I arrive.

I'm instituting emergency procedures.

All of you come with me.

That's far enough.

Disarm that man.

For $4.25 an hour?

Bullshit!

What...

All right, Luther. Before
this goes any further,

I'm willing to listen to your demands.

Only two.

Resign.
And the other one?

Unconditional surrender.

You're gonna regret this.

<i>- Â¶ Hey there, dreyfoos,
what you say? Â¶</i>

Â¶ hey there, dreyfoos,
what you say? Â¶

Â¶ how many vets
did you kill today? Â¶

<i>Â¶ how many vets
did you kill today? Â¶</i>

<i>- Â¶ hey there, dreyfoos,
what you say Â¶</i>

clear a path through for us, will you?

Just cut a path right in there.

That's federal jurisdiction.

You handle this.

What do you mean,
it's federal jurisdiction?

<i>- You're gonna have.
To handle this.</i>

<i>- What do you mean,
I'm gonna have to handle this?</i>

I have no jurisdiction here!

Wait a minute, how am I supposed
to handle this by myself?

It's your job.

If they chained themselves to that bus
stop out there across the street,

I'll handle it.
But this is your store.

I don't give a damn about that bus stop!

Get these people out of here.

I can't do anything about it.
I'll remember you too!

<i>- Â¶ V.A. Hospital.
Have no cash Â¶</i>

<i>- Â¶ therefore, dreyfoos,
kiss my ass Â¶</i>

<i>- Â¶ therefore, dreyfoos,
kiss my ass Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ sound off! Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ three, four Â¶</i>
Luther:<i> Â¶ sound off! Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ one, two, three, four... Â¶</i>

my god!
It's the press.

It's Travis.

Shit.

One, two, three, four, five. Breathe.

One, two, three...
Got a pulse.

Four, five, breathe.

Get him up.
Come on.

<i>Go!</i>
Up!

<i>We're already 24 hours</i>

<i>into what appears to be a long siege.</i>

<i>The veterans,
along with doctors and nurses</i>

<i>and other medical volunteers
who support them,</i>

<i>seem to be in no mood for compromise,</i>

<i>as federal marshals finally arrive.</i>

<i>From here, I can see
the hospital director,</i>

<i>who is welcoming officials
from the justice department</i>

and the inspector general,
who flew in tonight

<i>on an emergency flight from Washington.</i>

Good to see you, sir.
Good to see you.

What's the latest word from Washington?

Well, same old story, no money.

Â¶ Hey there, dreyfoos,
what you say? Â¶

Â¶ hey there, dreyfoos,
what you say? Â¶

Â¶ how many vets
did you kill today? Â¶

<i>Â¶ how many vets
did you kill today? Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ sound off! Â¶</i>
all:<i> Â¶ one, two Â¶</i>

<i>sound off!</i>
Good evening, gentlemen.

<i>Â¶ Sound off! Â¶</i>
I'm the inspector general.

<i>I've come to do some talking
with... with your representative,</i>

Mr. Luther Jerome.

Mr. Jerome,

the inspector general's here.

Let me say, sir,

the pleasure is dynamic.

The main thing we don't wanna do, Luther,

we don't want to act out
a "Rambo" out here now.

We've heard it all before, general!

You've never heard it from me.
I give you my word.

And if I tell you it's gonna rain,
you can get yourself an umbrella.

You want an answer?

Well, here it is!

Let it go.

Why don't we just take these men
and go right through there?

It's not that simple,
Henry, for Christ's sake.

Sturg, they're giving us two hours
to evacuate. Then they're coming in.

Get the O.R. prepped.

All right, he doesn't have two hours.
Let's get a gurney.

Ready your positions.
There's no green light.

Take positions.
No green light.

<i>Repeat, no green light.</i>

<i>- Nobody shoots.
Move out.</i>

Get ready to lock and load.

Â¶ ...get it through
your stupid brains Â¶

<i>Â¶ you ain't gonna break our chains Â¶</i>

Â¶ you ain't gonna break our chains Â¶

Â¶ get it through your stupid brains Â¶

<i>Â¶ get it through
your stupid brains... Â¶</i>

what's the matter? Didn't you ever
want anything better than this?

You mean there's
something better than this?

Hey, sturg.
Ready for you.

Red lion to all units, stand by.
They're coming in.

<i>Â¶ ...you ain't gonna
break our chain Â¶</i>

<i>- 2 kilos, I'm gonna give him.
24,000 units of ep.</i>

You see how enlarged it is?

All right, let's go to work.

Cut the lights out now.

<i>Loss of power.</i>

Get light in here.
<i>Pressure's gone.</i>

<i>- Where the hell's.
The backup?</i>

Come on, stay with me, Travis.

Get ready to pull the pin.

What?

<i>Sturgess, they're coming in!</i>

Peter.

Have you ever pitched relief?

No. <i>- Well, you're up now. Go on.</i>

Everybody ready?
Sutures, please.

You got it.

Thanks, sid.

Okay, let's start the bypass.

Okay.

What the hell?

Luther, Luther, give me the gun.
Stop this.

Luther, Luther, the war's over.
Stop this.

This war's just starting.
Give me this.

They want this hospital, they're going
to take it away from us, right, boys?

We got all the patients that we need.

This is over. It's gone far enough.
It's over.

Over? What are
you talking about?

What about all those men out there?

Luther, I'm here because of these men.

I promised them this day
would mean something.

This is gonna mean something, Luther,

but we've gotta stop now.

Don't do it.

What, are you gonna shoot me, Luther?

Pressure's gone.
We're losing him.

Epinephrine in now.
Robin, come on.

<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

<i>Epinephrine in!</i>

Hey, Luther.

He's right, Luther.

God damn, whose side are these people on?

I'm gonna get a resolve
on this thing right now.

We're gonna get some answers
and I mean fucking quick.

<i>- We got a little.
Company here.</i>

<i>- Stay with me, Travis.
Come on.</i>

He's fading on us.

<i>All unauthorized personnel,</i>

<i>this is the FBI.</i>

<i>You are in violation of federal law.</i>

<i>Evacuate this building immediately.</i>

<i>- God damn it, I'm losing him.
Come on, defib.</i>

I got the pressors wide open here.

Good.

Clear.

Hello, pressure.
We're back up.

There we go. We got a
normal sinus rhythm.

<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

In a surprise move,

resistance inside
the hospital has collapsed.

Marshals went in minutes ago,

<i>followed by federal officials.</i>

<i>The siege may be over.</i>

<i>I'm Chris albee,
channel 10, k.J.M. News.</i>

Thank god!
Hallelujah!

I'll take care of this.

If you go in there now,
the patient will die.

This is one of them. The other
ringleaders are inside.

I want them all arrested.

Arrested?

This operation is unauthorized.

All of these doctors are under suspension

and I want them taken into custody, now.

Go ahead. What's another
patient more or less?

You never gave a shit before,
why should you start now?

You see what this hospital
has had to contend with?

Yes.

Yes, I think I do see.

Wait a minute, didn't you hear me?

I said I want them taken into custody.

As director of this hospital,

I demand that you arrest them all!

Take your hand off of me.

I've been in government
service damn near 40 years

and I've seen your kind
from Europe to Saigon.

It's a sad truth,

but shit does float to the top.

You'd better get you a good lawyer.

Congressional hearings tend
to be hazardous on careers.

God knows how this one's gonna turn out.

Go back to work, son.

Yes, sir.

Let's go, Claude.

<i>Let's go, men.</i>

Looks like you finally made it
to Washington after all, sir.

Congratulations.

<i>Luth! Luth! Luth!</i>

<i>Luth! Luth! Luth!</i>

God.

You know, I was thinking about

that accelerated internship
program you were talking about.

I'm in no real hurry.

There are a lot of interesting
possibilities to research right here.

<i>I'm serious.</i>

Hey, Robin.

<i>Maybe we'd, go for that
cup of coffee sometime.</i>

It's OK.

Thank you.

God, thank you.

<i>Just one minute.</i>

Yes, nurse.

Thought you'd be needing this...

Doctor.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

That's good.

<i>- Good afternoon.
As the new director,</i>

<i>I'm implementing the following regulations
to go into effect immediately.</i>

<i>First,</i>

<i>there has been a noticeable laxness
in appearance in this hospital.</i>

<i>Therefore,</i>

<i>I am reinstituting the dress code,</i>

<i>with no exceptions.</i>

<i>In addition,</i>

<i>there will be no, I repeat,</i>

<i>no unauthorized</i>

<i>medical procedures performed.</i>

<i>And to help us with our
new program of waste control,</i>

<i>I have prepared a special inventory form.</i>

<i>If you will examine this form,</i>

<i>you will find...</i>
