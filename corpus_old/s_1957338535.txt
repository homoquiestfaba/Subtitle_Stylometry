Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Maher.

Thank you very much.

How are you doing?

Thank you, everybody.

Thank you.

Wow.

Thank you so much.

Thank you very much.
Oh, boy.

Please, folks...

Thank you very much.

Thank you.
That is a wonderful
reception.

I appreciate that.
It is great to be back
in New York.

Great to be back on Broadway.

The show you're about to see tonight

is one I did for a little while
here on Broadway in the spring,

and the idea behind that show
was embodied

in that first poster that you see...

"Victory begins at home."

The idea that when you're in a war,

the home front,
us, the citizens,
can make a difference.

We can count.

The government used to believe that.

They used to tell you that.

They used to make posters like that.

But they don't do it anymore.

So I thought I'd make a few.

Now, of course,
my posters might be
a little different

than what the government
would tell you.

But then the government
tells you things like

drugs fund terrorism.

'Cause what better way
to get the heat off
the oil companies?

You can always... yeah, you know...

You can always blame anything on drugs.

There's an anti-marijuana
commercial running.

Have you seen this ad?
Where two 12-year-old boys
are left home alone

and they start smoking pot

and then one of them finds Dad's gun

and shoots the other accidentally

because they're high.

Only in America
is the villain in this scene

not the guns
or the shitty parenting,
but the pot.

It's... it's always the pot.

Drugs fund terrorism.
Come on.

Terrorists get their money
from the same place everybody
gets their money...

From their relatives.

And their relatives sell oil.

And therein is the problem.

They have the oil,

we have the Ford fuck-you-mobiles.

Which I'm not here to speak ag...

Look, I am not the car police.

I don't want to be the car police.

I understand Americans love their cars.

I don't get it, but I know
Americans love cars

and would hump them if they could.

But does anybody really need a Hummer

in city traffic?

You know? I mean...

I mean, what... what is next?

"Honey, let's take a tank
to the PTA meeting tonight."

You know, Arabs
are in the oil business.

Same as Texans, you know?

That's... no, that... that is not...

No, no, no, that is...

That is not to equate our government.

It's just to say that a political party

that gets a lot
of its campaign contributions
from oil companies

is not going to make this connection.

And neither are the Democrats

who like the money they get
from automobile unions.

So the two parties
are gonna do the only thing
they ever really do well

on a bipartisan level...

They're going to change the subject.

Ladies and gentlemen,
on September 11th, 2001,

America was attacked
by a squad of Saudi Arabians

working out of Germany,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

And by that I mean
we were attacked by Iraq.

What the...

What?

Yes, the true axis of evil in America

is the genius of our marketing

combined with the stupidity
of our people.

The... the way they were able
to morph bin Laden into Hussein

was just too easy, wasn't it?

I mean, I'm glad Hussein is gone,

but the Joker is not the Riddler,

and...

on this particular crime,

there was no blood in his Bronco.

The...

Do you know that the...

You know that
the governor of this state

suggested that we melt down
the toppled statues

of Saddam Hussein from Baghdad

and use them
in a new World Trade Center

so that we could send
a message to the world

that we are a people
who cannot tell Arabs apart.

Which all seems especially hypocritical

when you think about... the first thing

the administration told us
after the attacks

was no lumping
the terrorists in
with the whole Muslim world.

These are terrorists
who happened to be Muslim,

but don't enflame them all by lumping.

But then when they
can't find bin Laden,

"Lump!

Who said no lumping?
We love lumping!

We're lumping people!"

It must've been
so frustrating for them,
you know?

After all that tough talk about,

"We're gonna get 'em
dead or alive."

Which at some point became,
"Well, he's either dead
or alive.

You know, that's what we meant.

It's"...

"It's not about one man."

But it is,
and people wanna know,
where's Waldo?

And now we can't find Hussein,

the guy we went after
because we couldn't
find bin Laden.

And now...
and now they're both
making tapes.

It's like...

I guess what we're trying
to do is get them into some
sort of rappers' war

where they're
dissing each other
on each other's records,

and hopefully they'll pop
a cap in each other's ass

or s... I don't...

But, look, if you were against this war

or you don't
like the president,
you have to root for the plan

because this may have been Bush's war,

but it's America's peace now.

And you have to root
for the plan to succeed.

The plan, as I understand it,

being the total humiliation
and liquidation of Iraq,

followed by her rebuilding
from scratch in our image.

Otherwise known as Scientology.

It is amazing to me
what lies people care
most about.

It blows my mind that the one lie

that they still can't get over
is Monica Lewinsky.

That... that one
is the standard of mendacity

that ever came out of the White House.

When I think about the lies...

The huge, steaming-turd whoppers

that I've heard that have
affected all of our lives

just in my lifetime...
"JFK shot by a lone gunman."

"We're winning the war
in Vietnam."

"We didn't trade arms
for hostages."

"Global warming
needs more study."

"Clarence Thomas
is the most qualified person
we can find."

But the one they can't get over is...

"I did not get my dick sucked
by that woman."

I'm so...

"My hand was not on the titty
when she was on the knob

and that technically was not... "

This is what people obsess about?

It just backs up my case that
this is a feminized country

because obviously
the worst thing anyone
can ever do in America

is get a blowjob.

But lying about a war?
Eh, so what?

And, you know, look.
There is no doubt

that this is a war
that started under
false premises

because this is a war
that originally was sold to us

as one we had to fight
for our own self-preservation,
right?

Because there was
this meteor named Iraq

heading right for us,

and that if we did not
get rid of Saddam Hussein,

the moon would crash into the Earth

and eagles would eat your cock.

But when nobody bought that bullshit,

Bush started to end every speech with,

"And did I mention the torture?

The torture!
He gassed his own people!"

Uh, yeah, when your dad was president.

And he was so upset about it,
he almost interrupted
his golf game.

I mean, talk...

Talk about a delayed reaction.

Even the Kurds are like,
"Come on, it was the '80s."

"People were experimenting.
It was a crazy time."

I mean, this is why
we never really had
a coalition, you know.

We had England because Tony Blair

is George Bush's prison bitch.

And... and we had 200 Australians

and a Polish Jeep driver named Lars.

That...

And by the way,
on that subject, if I could
say one thing.

If I could give the president
just one bit of advice,

it's not a critique,
but, Mr. President,

when you have those joint
press conferences,

let Tony Blair
do the talking, you know?

Come on,
Mr. President.

You're too big for that.
You're the star of this thing.

You're Clint Eastwood.

Let the gay English character actor...

lay the pipe.

No, war is a lot easier than peace.

There's a lot of bright guys
in that administration,

but they forgot about that.

But it is too late
for the Democrats
to be crying foul

about this weapons
of mass destruction stuff.

They knew that was hyped bullshit

when they voted for it in October.

Now, should the President
of the United States

be a little bit more careful
about the intelligence he gets

and perhaps not trust Austin Powers?

Yes.

Does the average American

have more dangerous chemicals
in his garage?

Yes, apparently.

But, you know,
they still might find
weapons of mass destruction.

And if they don't,
I have it on good authority

that the Los Angeles
Police Department
will plant them.

But...

But, you know...

At the end of the day
to this administration
it doesn't matter,

because half the geniuses
in this country

think that we already
found weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq

and the other half
think that George Bush
is a fighter pilot.

That is an administration
that does understand pictures

because, you know,
once they got that picture
of him in the flight suit,

that was all they...
that was what the whole war
was about.

"Hello, look at me,
I'm in a flight suit.

My cock looks huge.

I'm on an aircraft carrier.

There's... big cock, flight suit, me,

military guys, flag.

Hello.
Why even have an election?"

No, he understands
a picture is worth everything.

I mean, this is a president
with no environmental policy,

but he knows enough
to, every six months,

do a photo op in front of a giant tree.

Every six months,
he just stands in front
of a big sequoia

with that smirk on his face like,

"Am I hurtin' that tree?

Am I pissin'
on that tree?
No.

I love that tree.
Tree, me, people.
Do the math."

And that is the environmental policy.

"There's a black kid sittin' on my lap.

I'm readin' to a black kid.
He's sittin' right on me.

Am I freakin' out?
No."

"Am I like,
'Get that tar baby
off of me?' No!"

And that's the race policy.

I mean, it's just astounding
how they work.

I mean, the 2000 convention
that the Republicans had?

Oh, my God.
The last time the Republicans

had that many black people on a stage,

they were selling them.

I mean...

Hey, folks, come on.

The entertainment
the first night of
the convention

was Chaka Khan.

This is the party running on integrity

'cause, you know,
when you get a bunch
of 60-ish red state

white people in a room
voting on entertainment...

Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan,
Chaka, Chaka, Chaka, Chaka...
it's all Chaka Khan.

It's, you know,
a couple of votes
for the Gatlin Brothers,

you know.

A few for the Dixie Chicks

before they joined Al-Qaeda, this is.

That's before.

Oh, it's such a shame
when our country singers

become Islamic fundamentalists.

Isn't that a...
I don't know why
that keeps happening.

The best photo op ever...

George Bush
about a year ago
at Mount Rushmore.

They set up the podium
at the base of the mountain

so that his head was exactly in line

and in proportion to the heads
on the mountain,

which I thought
was a pretty sleazy trick.

And I don't think
I'm the only one
who thought that

'cause I swear to God,
for about half a second,

I thought I saw Lincoln go...

And usually when they have a photo op,

they usually have a three-word slogan.

Because that is
our attention span,
three words, you know?

"Restoring
America's Future."

"Testing
America's Gullibility."

'Cause they know
you control the debate
by controlling the word.

You just gotta control the word.

You just gotta make
the politician say the word

that the hamsters in the focus group

make hit the pedal.

Say the word that makes
the hamsters hit the pedal.

"Values."

You don't have to mean it,
just say "values."

"Values, yes, values.
We... we like values.

Values are...
he said values.
We like that.

He has values."

They're, uh...

We used to have a tax
in this country called
the estate tax,

which was very popular
because it's a tax

on very, very, very rich fucks who die.

And people thought,
"That's a good person to tax,"

and that is a good person to tax

because rich fucks who die
should give away their money

or else they give it
to their ne'er-do-well kid
who becomes Uday Hussein.

But the Republicans changed the name

from the estate tax to the death tax.

And people went, "Death?
That could happen to me.

I'm not hittin' the pedal
on that one."

The Republicans
are so much better
at that word game.

Like, they're always
from the heartland.

Heartland?
Come on.

Dick Cheney
from the heartland,
ironically.

Uh...

I remember when they made
the announcement

that Dick Cheney was going to be
the vice president candidate.

They purposefully went back
to the heartland home of his,

back to Casper, Wyoming,

the only town whiter
than the ghost itself.

And they went back
to Dick Cheney's high school,

where he'd been the captain
of the football team,

and, folks, this
was when I knew I would
never be mainstream.

Because obviously
this shit works on people,

but, I mean, I would never
go back to my high school.

I hated my high school.

I hated the captain
of the football team.

I wish we had school shootings
when I was in high school.

These lucky kids today.

I would've loved
to have picked up a gun

and shot a bunch of kids
in my high school,

these spoiled bastards.

Anyway, there's Dick Cheney
back at his high school,

captain of the football team,

and then the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance,

they bring out his wife,

who of course had been
his high school sweetheart.

And, again, this so doesn't work on me.

That you married
the first chick to give you
a hand job.

You know, that's... thank you.

Oh, I kid Dick Cheney,
but he has a plan

to save the government money.

It involves
moving the White House
to the Cayman Islands.

How's that for wartime loyalty, huh?

These Fortune 500 companies
who move offshore.

Of course, they don't
really move offshore.

That's the scam.

Enron isn't
really headquartered
in the Bahamas.

It's a phone and a monkey.

And a mailbox to collect
their dirty, bloody money.

Plus, how stupid
are these companies,
you know?

The money gets to live
in the Caribbean.

They stay in Newark.
What?

It's so easy to say anything.

The one that's easy to say now
is, "I support the troops."

It doesn't cost you anything.
"I support the troops."

But I got a question for you.

Can you really support the troops

if you also support
these massive tax cuts
for the very rich?

'Cause, you know,
the people we say
are our heroes

are paid by tax dollars.

And we hear about teachers...
have to buy their own
school supplies.

Soldiers in this country
are on food stamps.

Firemen... well, firemen
get laid so easily, though.
Fuck them.

But anyway...

But, I mean, couldn't
somebody in Congress
stand up and say,

"Why don't we take
half of that big tax cut

and give it
to our heroes?"

Or is that why they're our heroes?

'Cause they work cheap?

It's okay.

Applause costs you nothing.

But think about that
next time you see George Bush

hugging a bunch of military guys.

And, look, I'm not gonna
rag on Bush all night.

Look, I will tell you this.
I will give George Bush
credit for this.

He is working a lot harder
than he thought he'd have to.

You know, there...

I tell ya,
no more homeschooling
for that boy.

He is going to class.

But spare me this nonsense
I have heard so often

about how, "Oh, we dodged a bullet

when Bush pulled off
the election and then
9/11 happened

because, you know,
if Al Gore had been
president..."

What, we'd be reading
the Quran now, is that it?

Like George Bush is the only one

who could've pointed
to Afghanistan on a map
and said, "Destroy that"?

I'm sorry, George Bush
pointing out a country
on a map?

Oh, I didn't know what I was thinking.

No, no.
Rumsfeld does the pointing.

See, I love him, Rumsfeld,

'cause he's so politically incorrect.

How could I not love him?

And what I love about him also

is that he makes no effort
to ever be reassuring.

You notice that?
He says things like,

"I don't think they could get
a nuclear bomb in there,

but, yeah, maybe."

What the hell is that?

Oh, and people say
he's Neanderthal and crude
and macho... you know what?

If we're gonna let
just one guy in America
not have to be a pussy,

I say it's the Secretary of Defense.

How about that?

However,
the Rumsfelds of the world,
they do need to be watched.

So do the Ashcrofts
and the Bushes and a lot
of other people,

and I think where
the citizens of this country...

Where we let ourselves down...

Is that after the attacks,

just when we should've
been paying more attention,

I think we paid less attention.

Because thinking
about icky things like war
and terrorism...

would cause stress.

And then they'd win.

And the president fed right into that.

He did not lead on this.

He had about...
a window of opportunity
of about two months

where he could've
asked us to do anything,
and what did he say?

"Keep shopping.
Spend money.

Take your wife to dinner.
Go see 'Cats' again.

Shop till they drop,
girlfriend."

Which is not to say
that we wouldn't
have done more,

'cause I think we would.

We are an industrious people.

But, you know, we're also a people...

If we can get out of work, we do.

This was brought home to me
about a year ago

when there was breaking news
from rural Georgia.

Do you remember this story?
They found all these bodies

behind this crematorium in Georgia.

And when I first heard of it,
I thought, "Ooh, this is some
sort of nefarious cult."

No, just lazy.

Just...

Just letting work pile up,
as many of us do.

It was like the "I Love Lucy" episode

with the chocolates coming
down the conveyor belt,
you know?

The guy just couldn't
keep up with the volume.

Plus, you're talking
about rural Georgia,

so it was confusing
'cause a guy would come in
asking for his wife

and his sister,
"Is that one body or two?"

You know, that...

Okay.

Many... a lot of people
from rural Georgia here
on Broadway?

That happens on Broadway.

Sorry.

Sorry to offend you.

I was just trying to make the point

that families are allowed
to be different.

Well, we were told that after 9/11.

That's what the government said,

you know, that this was not
a clash of civilizations.

Osama bin Laden, for example...
Do you know this?

Is the 17th of 55 children.

It's always the middle 20
that give you the problems.

Is that right?

But... this is not
a clash of civilizations?

Yeah, we have
two, three kids,
you have 55.

We like to have our women
in the workplace,

you keep yours in beekeeper suits.

What is up with the beekeeper suits?

I mean, can you imagine
if some white country

kept its black people
in beekeeper suits?

There'd be a riot at the UN.

Jesse Jackson's head would explode.

Al Sharpton would call
a press conference.

How do you get away...
How does a country get away

with keeping
half its population
in beekeeper suits?

I'll tell you how.
They say the magic word...
"religion."

It's their religion.
You say "religion,"

you can get away with anything.

The Catholics
got away with fucking kids,

for crying out loud!

Oh, you're right.
I made that up.

I'm sorry, you're right.

I pulled that right outta my ass.

That has not been in the paper a lot.

Excuse me, they had
to have a conference

to decide if they should
continue to fuck kids.

They did.
A guy made a speech.

He said, "Look, we've had
a good long run...

but, uh, it's become
something of a meat market
around here.

Put a little more lotion
on Father Tom, Billy."

I mean, come on.

But, look, all you need to know

about the fact that this is
a clash of civilizations

is the beekeeper suit, that burka.

The fact... the way we treat
our women so differently.

I mean, in our society,

we try to get women to undress
as much as possible.

We like to be teased.

Whereas their view is,
"If I can't have the pussy,
I don't want to see it.

Okay, just... that is too painful.

Just throw a tarp on that because I...

I'll be thinking
about that all day."

You know, whereas in this country,

women wear these jeans that are cut...

That had to be
the last straw
for bin Laden.

When those jeans...
that was like, "You pushed
my buttons on... "

Because, you know,
it's like a woman
walks into a place

and just like,
"Hi, you don't even
know my name,

you're one inch from pussy.

What do you think about that?

Haven't even met me,
you are one inch from pussy.

We haven't said hello."

You're on the one-yard line,
the game has not begun.

It's amazing.

But I tell... you know
who I feel sorry for
in America

is whores.

Because what can a whore
wear anymore that...

You know...

What can a whore wear

to signal the prospective customer,

"No, I'm a real whore.
I'm selling this ass.

I'm not on my way
to an award show,
I'm a whore.

A real whore."

But, you know, we're all whores.

You do know that, right?

That's what Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson said
after 9/11.

They said, "God let it happen
because we're wicked,

because we're abortionists
and homosexuals and adulterers,

so God let it happen."

Which I don't agree with,
but it cleared something
up for me

because I've always wondered, right?

"What's the nature of God?"

And now I know.
He's a prick.

Oh, he let it happen.
A prick, wow.

Interesting.

I had heard good things,
but apparently not.

Are there any Christian
fundamentalists here tonight?

No? Because, you know,
I have been defending

the Christian fundamentalists
because it really bothers me

when people compare
their fundamentalists
with ours.

I hear it all the time.
"You know, we have
extremists, too."

Uh, yeah, but this is
a great country because ours
are just funny.

The worst ours can do is,
like, you know, identify
the gay Teletubby.

That's like... it's purple!
It's purple!

You're... purple, gay, hello!

Your kids are seeing a gay...

You know, whereas in Saudi Arabia...

You know, our ally.

In Saudi Arabia, on Friday nights,

they have beheadings for
such crimes as homosexuality

or adultery or being
an infidel or not rewinding
or whatever.

So, yes, Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson

are morons who think
homosexuals are going
to burn in hell,

but they're not suggesting
that we go over

to Richard Simmons' house
and cut off his head.

I'm suggesting it.

In fact,
I'm insisting on it.
No.

No, I think
Western civilization
is more enlightened

precisely because we have learned

how to ignore our religious leaders.

You know?
Every religious leader
says things.

You know, when one of their
ayatollahs issues a falafel,

they do it.

We don't follow it.

I mean, the pope says a lot of things.

"No premarital sex."

"Thank you very much.

Charming.
You are a charmer,
thank you.

Hey, kids, get in here.
Look, it's the pope.

Oh, it's like seeing
an albino tiger in the wild.

How much longer
are you gonna be able
to see that, the pope?"

"No masturbation."

"He's doing
all his greatest hits,
look at that."

You know?

"Thank you.
You're a fabulous
Catholic celebrity.

Now go back
to the castle."

Sometimes people say to me,

"Bill, you're prejudiced
against the Muslims."

No, I promise you I am not.

"Prejudiced" comes from prejudge.

I am not prejudging.
I am judging.

Yes, I am judging that
if your TGIF is beheadings...

and getting
stoned in your country
is a bad thing,

then, yes,
you're bringing up the rear,
civilization-wise.

You need an enlightenment,
you need a reformation,
you need something.

I don't feel bad for those 300 killers

we got down in Guantanamo Bay

always crabbing
about how we don't respect
their religious practices.

You know what? You lost.
Eat what we eat.

Here's
a cheese-filled Snausage.
Enjoy.

You don't like that, just eat the bun.

You don't like that?
Don't eat anything.
You won't be missed.

I would also say to them

that if we ever find the body
of a suicide attacker,

we will bury it wrong.
Wrong.

With a hooker and a bottle
of Jack Daniels...

facing Barney's.

That... that's the worst.

But you have to understand,
you have to embrace

the values of Western civilization

are not just different,
they are better, okay?

I know a whole generation
has been raised

on the notion of multiculturalism,

that all civilizations
are just different.

No, not always.
Sometimes things are better.

Rule of law is better
than autocracy and theocracy.

Equality of the sexes... better.

Protection of minorities... better.

Free speech... better.
Free elections... better.

Free appliances
with large purchases...
better.

Don't get so tolerant
that you tolerate intolerance.

Remember what happened
to Salman Rushdie?

He wrote a book, it got mixed reviews.

Some people liked it,

some people wanted his head on a stick.

No one should have to die
for writing a book

with the exception of
"The Bridges of Madison County."

I will... I will make...

But, look,
I will always defend
the West, our way of life,

but I sure understand
why people hate us around
the world,

and that's not just Arabs
and not just Muslims.

Lots of people hate us,
and they're not all wrong.

I'll give you an example
just from our own hemisphere.

Do you know what Plan Colombia is?

Well, you get the first 12 CDs
for a penny.

No, that's...

No, Plan Colombia is a massive
defoliation program

that we have going
that our military is conducting

in the country of Colombia

that is ruining their countryside.

Why are we doing it?

Because there are some plants
down there that are evil.

How do we know they're evil?

Well, they don't have
Bristol-Myers Squibb,

Eli Lilly, or Pfizer written on them.

So...

And, by the way,
if cocaine gave you
an erection

instead of took one away,

not only would it be legal,
but Bob Dole would
do ads for it.

We do give the world the impression

that we think American lives
are more valuable

than anybody else's lives, which is odd

because we're supposed to be
a religious people,

and I thought God made humans
and not Americans.

But I didn't even know he was a prick.

I think people hate us around the world

because they perceive
that we waste when
we could share,

and they're not
totally wrong about that.

We are gluttonous.
We shop with forklifts.

We eat giant food off of giant plates.

We have a holiday
where we stuff food
into other food.

I mean...

Thanksgiving is really typical

of how we think
about third world
indigenous people.

We celebrate
the one nice moment
we ever had with the Indians.

It'd be like a date rapist saying,

"Let's concentrate
on the nice dinner we had
early in the evening..."

Yeah, I'm not...

You know, if you're an American

and you're born at this time
of the history, especially,

you're lucky.
We all are.

We won the world history
Powerball lottery.

But a little modesty about it
might keep the heat off of us,
you know?

I can't take people
who say things like,
"We built this country."

You built nothing.

I think the railroads were
pretty much up by 1980.

These are the same people
who always get all uppity
about immigration.

"They're taking
American jobs."

Yeah, right.

Like you'd stand on the freeway
and sell oranges out of a bag.

These poor people
swim through a river of sludge

to get here to park our cars,

pick our fruit, blow our leaves.

They do all the jobs
nobody else wants to do,

like landscaping
and impregnating Madonna.

And what do people say?
"Keep 'em out.

Build a wall."
Which is a dumb idea.

Walls never work.

The one they're building
in Israel isn't gonna work,

the Berlin Wall didn't work,

the Great Wall of China didn't work,

that invisible space diaphragm
that we're putting up there...

although that one, I must say...

When I read recently
that the North Korean guy,

Lil' Kim...

You know the guy?

When I read that he had
missiles that could reach
Los Angeles,

I was like,
"What is the delay with
the space shield, please?

Could we get
the magic umbrella
up and working?"

'Cause, you see,
danger focuses the mind.

I don't know why
that hasn't worked better
here already.

Like, especially at the airport.

You think that would be the one place

where it would've worked better.

And people say,
"Oh, things have gotten
better at the airport."

Really?
No, they've gotten whiter.

It looks to me
like they just fired
all the black people

and hired white people.

I don't know why,
but it used to be Shaniqua

with the eight-inch fingernails
going through my bag...

and now it's a white guy named Roy.

But... but white, black,
they're still using

the same method... random.

Random.

Al Gore famously
was pulled out of line.

Al Gore.

Now, come on,
he's two electoral votes
from being president,

but he's the terrorist?

At least that's how
they reported it on Fox News.

But, uh...

But, come on.

Do we really need to search Al Gore?

And they gave him the full search,

including the anal cavity search,

and they found his head.

Oh.

You know what?
You gotta get over that.

Al Gore lost that election
all by himself

by maintaining his pledge
to end charisma as we know it.

You gotta get over Florida,
Democrats, seriously.

The Republicans
did not steal that election.

It did fall off a truck...

but they didn't
exactly steal it.

But, no, I mean, come on,
at the airports,

it was over a year after 9/11

when people at the airport,
the authorities,

were still using the honor system.

Remember, we still
had to answer those
two brilliant questions...

"Did you pack
your own bags?"

"No, Allah packed my bags today.

What, bad answer?"

You know,
we still have to show
our ID three times.

That's the key,
three times before
you get on the plane,

'cause who could ever have a fake ID?

Bush's daughters had a fake ID.

Come on.

Yeah.

ID... like it's gonna say
"Carlos the Jackal"
right on it.

"Mr. The Jackal,
please step out of line."

The first thing they did
at LAX after the attack

to calm everybody's nerves
was they put out a decree:

no more curbside drop-offs

except by licensed people.

Only licensed taxis and limousines.

All of which, of course,
are driven by people

from Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Fuckyoustan,

We-hate-you-stan,
Shove-it-up-your-ass-stan.

You know, if that Republican
slogan machine

could just come up with
a better name than "profiling."

If they would just call it
"proactive intelligence
screening,"

people would go,
"It's about time we had
a little of that around here."

'Cause, you know,
it's good to be color-blind

and it's good to be ethnic-blind

and it's good to be religious-blind,

but at the end of the day,
blind does mean you can't see.

And if you can't see,
how are you gonna tell
what color it is

on the Terrorist Threat Advisory Chart?

'Cause, you know, I go by that thing.

Don't you?
'Cause, you know,
like, when it's yellow,

I'm pretty normal, you know.

I'm just... maybe...
maybe I look around
every four or five...

But when it's orange, I...

What, take a sweater?

I mean, what... what is the plan here?

Now, you know that we are not serious

about winning the terror war
for one simple reason.

Because we still have a drug war.

I think it's very telling
that the last airport incident
I heard about before 9/11

was when Aaron Sorkin,
the brilliant writer/producer
of "The West Wing,"

got caught trying to take
mushrooms to Las Vegas.

Ooh, when I heard that, I said,

"What a great idea."

No wonder why this guy
wins the Emmy every year.

That's a brilliant way
to make that town bearable.

But...

But thank God they got him, huh?

Because, you know,
if we start letting
creative people

take funny mushrooms
to resort cities...

what?
What would happen?
Please, tell me.

Take me down that slippery slope,

from Aaron Sorkin with his mushrooms

to your kid turning tricks
behind a dumpster
to make a fix.

Take me on that journey
and I will get behind
the drug war.

The police report said
that Mr. Sorkin's judgment

was impaired getting on the plane.

I hope so.

Isn't that what we're trying for?

I mean, is he driving the plane?

'Cause if not,
why do we need judgment
on the plane?

"Peanuts, trail mix, I... I don't know.

I can't decide.

Four bucks for
the Sandra Bullock movie?

I-I...
My mind is cloudy."

Judgment impaired going to Las Vegas,

a town built on impairing
people's judgment.

Have you ever been to a casino?

There's no clocks, there's no oxygen,

they're plying you with liquor.

You need a police dog
just to find your way out.

But don't get fucked up on the way.

Let the professionals fuck you up.

That's...

Which...

Which is, by the way,

the official drug policy
of the United States
government.

I'm not kidding.
That is our drug policy.

Let the professionals fuck you up.

It's not like
we don't have drugs
in this country.

We got a million drugs.

Let the professionals do it, though.

Why is marijuana,
the one drug that never
killed anybody,

somehow on the illegal side
of the divide?

Why does every administration,
Democrat, Republican,

take the same stupid dodge about,

"We need to do more study"?

Yeah, they all study it.
You know what they found?

It makes you eat cookie dough.

I think the drugs
that are a lot scarier

are the ones they advertise
on the 6:30 evening news.

Those...

I mean, they advertise
these prescription drugs
that...

Damned if I know what the problem is,

what the cure is.

It's just vaguely happy people.

Just... it's a woman in a wheat field.

She's just very happy about wheat.

I don't... you know...

There's one with a guy
dancing on a melting clock.

I'm not kidding.

He's dancing on a melting clock.

"You may not need"...
I don't care about need,
I want that one, okay?

That's... this is past need.

"Tell your doctor..."

Tell your doctor?

Shouldn't your doctor
tell you what drugs you need?

When you tell your doctor,

isn't he just a dealer at that point?

It's funny, in America,
half the people in this country

think that drugs
is what you have to regulate
to make us safer

and half the people think guns...

That's what you gotta regulate
to make us safer.

But I always think,
if you're gonna regulate
one thing

that has the most potential
to cause death and destruction...

Religion,
you gotta start
with religion.

I'm not...

I don't say this out of bitterness.

Look, I was raised Catholic.

But, you know, I was never molested.

And I'm a little insulted,
quite frankly.

I guess they didn't find me attractive.

But, uh, I was attractive
and it's their loss.

I... I really understand
how this nightmare

of clerical pedophilia
could've happened,

because if you're a priest
and you spend your whole life

spewing this nonsense
about the snake and the whale

and the apple and the rib,

it's like,
"Oh, fuck it.
Just blow me, kid."

What the fuck?
Just...

Also, what is so hard

about just saying
the words, "I don't know"?

I don't know.

Of course there are questions
that plague all of us.

How did we get here?
What happens when we die?

Is there a heaven?
Am I on the list?

Who let the dogs out?
Yes.

But why would you believe
what some other human being

whose brain, I promise you,
is no bigger or better
than yours...

When he tells you
he knows what happens
when you die?

"Don't masturbate now.

You won't get to hang out
with Jesus in heaven.

How do I know?
I... I've got a pointy hat.

I've got a hat and a robe

and I have smoke
and a wand."

It's so gay, the whole church.

It's just... could they just
come out of the closet?

Really?
I mean, it's just so...

You know, every Sunday,
it's such a pageant

with the costumes
and the wands and the goblets

and the smoke and the kneeling down

in front of another man
with your mouth open.

Nothing gay about that, no.

Nothing gay there.

So...

are our religions corrupt?
Yes, of course they are.

But once again, I have to say,
their religions, even worse.

Even worse.
I mean, that thing
about the 72 virgins?

That's the lowest.

Promising pussy in the afterlife

is the lowest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

I mean, I am no Christian,

but I do think Jesus
is a fantastic role model,

and the reason he is
is because he never said
anything like,

"Blessed are the meek
for they shall get laid."

Also, by the way, 72 virgins

is very suspicious to me.
It's a clue.

It tells you
we're dealing with people
from a bartering culture.

Because nobody starts with that number.

Somebody said,
"100 virgins." "50."

"85." "69." "79."

"71." "73." "72."
"Done."

That's how you got 72.

Yes.

We are dealing with people
from the Middle East.

Arabs and Jews
who have a lot more in common
than they would like to admit,

and one of the things
they have in common

is that they're from the Middle East,

which was called that
because it's in the middle.

Because everything that went
from Europe to Asia

always through...
the commerce always had
to go through the middle.

That's why Columbus
was looking for another way.

And people said to him, "Chris,

if you take this journey,
you're gonna die."

And he said,
"I would rather sail off
the edge of the fucking world

than deal with those people
one more day!"

Have you been to the mall?

But people
from the Middle East,
they are good with money.

That is in their history.
It is in their heritage.

Terrorists are very good
with money for that reason.

They're brilliant at laundering money.

It's the one thing they do launder.

Ooh, ooh, oh, Bill.

Don't make fun of the people
who attacked us.

No, it's true.
They know how to move things
through untraceable items,

including... and I know
women hate to hear this...
diamonds.

A good way to fight terrorism...
Don't buy diamonds

'cause they move stuff
through diamonds.

And, well, I know women,
they hate to hear that

because women think about diamonds

the way men think about sex

the way leeches think about blood.

But diamonds have
a lot of blood on them

even without the terrorist connection.

Take that away, they have
a lot of blood on them

because diamonds are mined
in Africa by rebel armies.

And the rebel armies
control the territory

and make the villagers
mine the diamonds,

and they control them through terror,

through such lovely things
as cutting off the arms
of the little children,

something you never see
in the De Beers commercials.

Now, I told this to a woman recently

who is only
about the nicest person
I've ever met.

But she is a woman,
and I told her about Africa

and the armies and the rebels
and the terror

and the cutting off the arms
of the little children,

and she looked up at me
with a little sad face

and said,
"Both arms?"

I swear to God, that's a true story.

Now, I know it's the national
law here in America

that women are more evolved than men,

but if that's true, how come
they're still so impressed
by shiny objects?

I'm just asking.
I'm just asking.

Please, it is not anti-woman
just to talk about women, okay?

And we're going to do it now...

because when I say this is
a feminized country,

first of all, understand that I get it

that there are millions
and millions of women

who are steely-eyed realists

and millions
and millions of men
who are anything but.

However, for lack of a better term,

I would say
that the feminine values
are now the values of America.

Sensitivity is more important
than truth.

Feelings are more important than facts.

Commitment is more important
than individuality.

Children are more important
than people.

Safety is more important than fun.

I always hear women say, you know,

"Married men live longer."

Uh, yes, and an indoor cat...

also...

lives longer.

It's a fur ball with a broken spirit

that can only look out
on a world it will never enjoy,

but it does technically live longer.

See, this is very personal to me

because I'm, like,
the last of my guy friends

to have never gotten married,

and their wives,
they don't want them
playing with me.

You know, I...
I'm like the escaped slave.

I bring news of freedom, you know?

It's... it's not a good thing
to have me around, you know?

Keep the husbands in the dark.

They're happier that way.

So I know women
don't have it easy
in America,

but it is sort of politically incorrect

just to be male in this country now.

I mean, look at television.
Look at any sitcom.

The wife is always
brilliant and ethereal

and right about everything.

And the husband is always a dumb fuck

lucky to have found her.

The only smart men
on television are Frasier
and his brother,

both of whom are gayer
than Little Richard's
underpants.

So, I understand that women suffer,

but I don't think
it's as much publicized

that a lot of men in America

are living lives of quiet desperation,

lobotomized of their libido,

anesthetizing themselves
with sports and pornography

and living in an Orwellian world

where we have to pretend to concur

with the woman's point of view.

On any TV show in America,

if somebody got up there and said,

"You know, women are smarter than men,"

automatic round of applause.

If somebody said,
"Men are smarter than women,"

you'd be booed off the stage.

I mean,
what does that tell you
about our culture

that we have to pretend
that one sex is smarter
than the other?

Women are smarter than men.

If women ran the world,
there'd be no wars.

Being pregnant is sexy.

You know, just a whole roster of things

that we don't really believe,
but we pretend to believe

because it's easier to make women nod

than to live in the doghouse.

I heard one
on daytime TV
the other day.

Only a woman could've said this,

and of course everyone
pretended it was true.

She said,
"A couple should explore
their mutual fantasies."

There are no such things
as mutual fantasies.

Yours bore us, ours offend you.

Trust me.

Ladies, trust me,
there is no fantasy
where a handsome prince

runs to you across a meadow
and takes you in his arms

and pledges his undying love

and then comes on your face, okay?

That would be a mutual fantasy

if you've ever seen a porn movie.

But I think...
I think men are just tired

of apologizing for being men,

and I think women
would be a lot happier

if you'd stop making us
apologize for it.

You'd save yourselves
a lot of wear and tear.

For one thing, give you one example,

no woman in America
would ever get breast implants.

Because if you really
got inside the man's mind,

you'd understand
that it's never about
big or little

or short or tall or blonde or brunette.

It's only about old and new.

Hugh Grant had
Elizabeth Hurley at home.

He wanted Marvin Hagler in a wig.

You cannot reform biology.

And, by the way,
the male impetus
to spread our seed

is why we are a successful species.

That is why
we're sitting here
right now.

But do we get thanks for it?
No, we get impeached.

Hey, you know what?

That whole election
was a feminized issue

because that 2000 election
was all about the Republican
marketing machine.

They were able to morph
monogamy into integrity

the same way they morphed
bin Laden into Hussein.

I mean, Bush's whole campaign was all,

"We're gonna
be restoring integrity."

Well, excuse me, but the Bush family,

especially when they're running
for the White House,

has no more integrity
than anybody else.

They do what they have to
to win like everybody else.

Maybe they don't have less,
but they don't have more.

The difference is
they fuck their wives.

And that's what he ran on.
"I fuck my wife!

I'm a wife fucker!
I have integrity!

I fuck my wife!

Unlike a certain president
I could name.

And his vice president
who 'was there.'"

"Was there."
They make it sound
like Al Gore

was holding Monica's hair, you know?

"Come on, babe.

Come on, honey, finish up.

I got Arafat waiting
in the Rose Garden here, babe."

I mean, come on.

"The Starr Report"
was a marketing document.

It had nothing to do with the law

and had everything to do
with making sure

everybody knew
all the lurid little details,

like that one of their trysts
took place on Easter.

That's right,
the president had his dick

in a Jew's mouth on Easter!

Run against that, motherfucker!

And Al Gore took the bait.

That's why Al Gore tried to prove

that he loved his wife even more.

Remember he kissed her
at the convention?

That disgusting kiss?

Have you ever seen
anything so disgusting?

Can you imagine any other politician?

Can you imagine Richard Nixon?

"Come here,
Pat, you bitch."

I'm gonna chew
on your ass, you little"...

But that was Al Gore's way of saying,

"I fuck my wife, too."

And a week later,
George Bush let himself
get caught on camera

grabbing his wife's ass

'cause that's his way of saying,

"Oh, you're not gonna steal
the integrity issue from us.

We're the wife fuckers
in this election!

I fuck my wife,
my brother fucks his wife,

my dad even fucks his wife.

And that's
a lot of integrity."

Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

You're a great crowd.

Thank you.

I appreciate you coming out!

Thank you!

Thank you, folks.

Thank you very much.
