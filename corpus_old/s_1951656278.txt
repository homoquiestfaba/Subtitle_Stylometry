Hello?
Hello?

Christ.

Help!

Over here!

Help!

I couldn't find
any of you.

How far did we drift?

It was about
a kilometer maybe.

That's some
freaky pull.

You couldn't see anything,
just a load of bubbles.

I reckon he probably
got drunk

and fell asleep on his lilo.
We're too far out.

Jesus!

Christ.

We've come too far down.
We must have.

That's the hotel.

John, John!

Martha, where are you?

Hurry up, there may
be another wave.

No no no!

Wait! Ian!

John!

Dad, Dad!

Ian!

Dad!
John!

Martha!

Ian!

Oh my God.
Martha... Ian!

Daddy-- Daddy.

Hey, you.

You forgot to post the paychecks.
Oh no, I did it today.

Don't worry.
Look at that.

What do you think, sweetheart?
Look at that.

What do you think, baby?

Listen, take her.
I'm just going to check in.

Right.

What's first?
What are we doing first?

Swimming.
Swimming.

You have the passports,
darling?

Stop it.

Adam, help your brother.

Sa-wat dee kha.

Excuse me,
I was about to--

Uh...

That's fine.
Go ahead.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Merry Christmas.

Carters.
Yes, thank you.

Don't embarrass me.
Chill, Mom.

Come on,
bring the bags.

Hi!

Sorry, I'm late.

Hey, hey...
what are you doing?

You've lost a button.

Than! Get those plates
to table two.

Yes, ma'am.

Cheers,
my darling.

One two three--

Wobbly custard.

Oh, that's great.

That'll make
Granddad jealous.

I told you this would be
more fun than skiing.

I'm telling you again,

we came here to dive.

Shit.

Thank you.

Okay okay.
I'll go diving.

Are you sure they have
a mask that fits you?

Not too early.

You shouldn't tease
him like that.

It's his holiday too.

Two weeks
in a luxury resort--

that boy's got nothing
to complain about.

Oh, no no no.
Not that one.

I think that's us.

I don't think Daddy likes that music.
Yeah, let's go.

You won't get up in time.

What? Are you scared
of the water?

No, I'm not scared
of the water-- I told you.

You're just like Dad.
What?

Seriously, no--
Come with me.

No...

What do you reckon?

Ooh.

No rush hour and you
get to see dolphins.

Go on, you go.
I left my snorkel at home anyways.

Yeah?

Just...

don't get
eaten by sharks.

There aren't any sharks.
Oh yeah.

Whale sharks.
Native to Thailand.

Also known
as blah chalalam nah.

Hey hey hey.
No no no.

If you watched
a little bit more TV, see--

you'd know.
Blah belplsey?

No no no--
blah chalalam nah.

Blah blah blah.

Hello, friend.
Hi, hi.

Not in bed yet?
No-- just listening to the radio.

I'm on my way home.
Good night then.

Grandma...

You stink of fried fish.
Give me your shirt to wash.

I have something for you.
Thank you.

You're up early!

Hurry up-- you have
to go to school.

Thank you, Grandma.
Have a good day.

Goodbye.

Hurry-- eat up and then
you can go to school.

That's kind of doing it
for me actually.

Oh, no ice cream
before lunch.

What are you
on about?

Beach equals ice cream.

That's like toast
without butter.

No, I'm not
talking about Martha.

No no. You've got
to be kidding.

Oh, who are they?

That's us
swimming in the sea.

Oh yeah?
Where are the sharks?

Shh.
Come on. Teeth.

Right, I'm off.
All right.

In front.

In back.

Hello.

Am I late?
Don't worry, it's okay.

What are you
looking at?

Come on--
clear the tables.

Excuse me.

Could we wait
for my husband please?

Sorry, we really
have to get going.

Great.

Hi, hello.
Hi.

Hello.
Hello.

Bye, Mommy.

Bye, Mommy.

So we're going
to say hello to Mommy.

Mommy!
Hello hello.

Hello, Mommy.
Bye bye.

Come on, hurry up!

You gonna say hello
to Granddad?

Hello, Granddad.
Hello, Granddad.

The fish are all funny.

Yeah.

Daft buggers.
Buggers?

Hey, don't let your mother
hear you say that, okay?

Come on, oh, seriously.
Seriously, all right?

Let's go get
your water wings.

John!

Why the hell
didn't Mom wake us?

She did but we ignored her.
What?

What's happened
to the sea?

It's cool.

What fish
is Nemo?

Well, he's blue so--
Orange.

Well, he's blue so--
Orange!

Hi.
Good morning.

I'd have Nemo with chips.
No, Daddy.

A little bit
of ketchup. Oh...

What's happening, Daddy?

Daddy Daddy?

Come on!

Get in, get in! Come on!

Daddy, Daddy.

Don't let go!

Don't let--

Martha!
Hold on!

Martha, hold on!

Daddy!

Daddy!
Martha, hold on!

Hold the tree!
Daddy, save me!

Hold it, Martha!
Hold the--

Daddy!
Hold the tree! Grab the tree!

Grab the tree!

Hold on, Martha!

That's it, baby!
Hold on!

Hold on!
Hold on!

Hold on!

Hold on!
Hold on, baby!

Hold on!
Hold tight!

Mommy!
Hold on, Marth--

Guys, guys.
A bit of hush in the back.

Thank you.

So I've asked myself,
how is it

that I've ended up lumbered
with you lot over Christmas?

I mean, what a ragbag collection
of waifs and strays we are.

You know, we're going to be
found out one of these days.

I mean, just look at it.

As many of you know,
my ex-wife used to say,

"You might as well
be married to the job."

All I can say is
it's been a very happy affair.

And it's time for some
thank yous:

To the lovely Sue,
for keeping my diary in shape;

And to all of you who are
committed to working so hard

with the people
of Thailand.

I certainly couldn't do
my job without you.

So to those of us

who haven't skived off on holiday...
Hi.

...I'd like to raise
my glass of festive fizz

and wish you all
a very happy Christmas.

Happy Christmas!

Alec, this is Tom Philips,
who's recently joined us.

Hello, Tom.
Nice to meet you.

Lovely children, they're from the
coastal villages. Aren't they fantastic?

Absolutely charming.

I think the...

little one's meant to be
the evil twin.

Will you excuse me?

Reports are sketchy,

but it seems to have hit
Indonesia and Sri Lanka first.

Bev?
Drafting in everyone she can.

The phones have
gone ballistic.

And here, Patong
and possibly Krabi.

Ah, I've already had calls from CNN,
BBC World, and uh--

Put London straight through.
Sir.

Robert, Christine, both Peters
are out of the country.

Daniel and his girlfriend
are on holiday.

Well, call him in. We're gonna
need his input on this.

No one's answering.
They were staying near Phuket.

We're gonna need
more phone lines.

Get one of Hanuman's boys
to set that up as soon as possible.

The emails coming in
have crashed the system.

London...

line one.

Mark?

What have you got
for me?

Yes, I'm just looking.

Christ.

Yeah?

Nick, Nick,
turn on the TV.

Some kind of wave's
hit the south.

Chaku Chak Park,
10 minutes, okay?

Suk?

Simone wants us
to cover it.

Simone fired me,
right?

You got
your job back.

It's Christmas.
I swung it.

Don't be late,
they're closing the airport.

Where are we going?

Phuket. Look, I'm serious,
don't be late, okay?

Ah.

Help--

Help me!

Martha!

Somebody help me!

Martha!

Higher ground.

We have to go
higher ground.

Martha!
Maybe second wave coming.

There more wave.

Martha!

Everything gone.

Run, run!

We must get
to safe place.

She was holding
the tree.

Martha!

They have gone
to higher ground.

Please?

If it come again--
Martha!

Martha!

Martha!

Martha!

We take Jim's car.
Bev, Sue and the others will follow.

You sure there's
no way we can fly?

The runway at Phuket's
been hit pretty bad.

They've cleared a section.
There's a couple of flights

leaving Bangkok as we speak
but you won't make it.

I think the plan is
to shut it down completely

until they're sure
it's safe to land.

Oh, Kathy,
Kathy Graham, Rama Kids.

Ah, you head up
the Education Outreach.

Yeah.

Which brought you
your entertainment today.

Yeah, we're working with villages
all along the Phuket coastline.

We don't know how many
of them have been hit yet.

Joe, I'll drive.

I can't get through to any
of my colleagues down there.

12 hours is
the best I can do.

Well, 11 if you
know the back roads.

You will need to do press
along the way, sir.

BBC want a live link.

Rama Kids,
that a Christian organization?

Mm-hmm.
But I promise no smells,

bells or songs for the duration
of the journey.

Come on?

All right.
Okay, let's get going.

Yes, sir!

You can't mess
this one up, Nick.

Simone's still sore
from Burma.

She really made me sweat
to get you this gig.

All right.
It was one lost weekend.

It was a month.
I bailed you.

What, are you still sore at me?
Yeah.

Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

She...

Where is it?

Have to get away.

If the wave
come again--

I can't just
leave her!

Martha!

Martha? Martha!

Please...

please... my son.

Jesus Christ.

John.

John.

He need to go
to hospital.

John.

Please?

My wife...

was in the water.

I have to find them.

No, I have
to find them.

They look for you
on higher ground.

Everyone moving
to higher ground.

John.

One, two...

One, two, three!

Where are they?

One, two...

Susie!

Susie!

Were you with my wife?

Khao Lak?
On the boat?

Khao Lak!
Were you on the boat?

Was there any kind of warning sign?
You could hear it.

Like lots and lots
of crashing glass. We just ran.

And you said
that the wave...?

The wave was high. Three--
three floors, something like that.

Mm-hmm.
Hang on one sec.

Simone?
Welcome back. No fuckups this time.

Yeah.

Hang on a sec.

Yeah, Phuket Airport,
scenes of exodus

synonymous with
a war-torn country;

Evacuation flights

so far being laid on
only by the Thais.

Nothing in or out
until the end of the day.

There's talk of another wave,
currently unfounded,

though it looks like this one ricocheted
down the coast.

Uh, we're talking...
10 feet.

15 feet.

Maybe more, actually.

Z.N.P. are reporting figures of 10,
maybe 20 were students?

Z.N.P. are talking
out of their ass.

We're the first
foreign press down here.

There's a couple of local news crews.
They got some interviews.

Okay, I want
casualty figures,

numbers of dead.

Nick?

Simone?

Nick!
My cell's fucked.

What's that?

Best I could do.
Come on, get in.

Phuket's
the nearest hospital.

Get some shots
over there.

Stop leaning so far back,
you're pulling us over.

Shut up and drive.

You--

you served us
at the hotel, yeah?

I was with my daughter.
She's--

she's about
this high.

Cocoa Pop, banana...

play under table.

Yeah.

I told her to hold on.

She was holding on.

My wife...
was diving.

If she was in the water
between 9:00 and 10:00 then...

What was it?

I don't even know
what it was.

He need to drink.

There you go.

My son...

John.

How is John?

My wife.
She was with Adam.

We need to get back
to the main road.

He has to get
to a hospital.

You must have relatives.
I have to find my family.

Nice deep breath.
Come on.

You need someone
to look at that cut.

My village back there.

My grandmother won't
leave without me.

You get to hospital,
look for wife and daughter.

See ya.

Than.
Thank you.

Has anybody
seen my wife?

She's dark-skinned.

She's got curly hair,
about 5'9"?

My daughter, uh...

Martha, Martha Carter.

She-- uh,
she's six years old.

I left her holding
a tree in Khao Lak.

She was wearing
a pink swimming costume.

Picked up baby
on the truck ahead.

About six years old?

Yeah, about six.

That's her.

We're-- we're on our way
down right now.

There's a Liverpudlian man,
he can't locate his wife or his son.

Well, perhaps you can
find a contact point?

I'm being told
Phuket town hall.

Now how far are you
from the--?

Well, perhaps if you
can find a hotel?

Yes, I see.

Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-- I am truly sorry,

I don't know what
you do tonight.

Until our systems are in place,
it's impossible for us to--

I can't afford to deal
with everyone individually.

We'd get nowhere.
Hang on. Here he is.

Who is it?

Ah, Miles, hi.

I'll go this way.

Simone?
The main cellphone networks are down.

Where are you?
Phuket-- Phuket Hospital.

Okay, what you got?

A number of Westerners dead.
I counted...

20 already.
I got thr-- three kids--

one, two, three,
four, five--

nine women, and...

well, the rest are men.

Age range between 20 and a couple
of really old guys.

Hey.

Yeah, thanks.

Red Cross.

Just drafting
in backup.

Nick, Nick!

Whoa.

Sorry.

I couldn't
hold on to him.

I couldn't.

It came up to
the third floor.

Where were you, love?
Khao Lak.

In Khao Lak?

Oasis Hotel,
Khao Lak.

Chai?

It's Khao Lak!

The relief's getting in,
why can't we?

What are you
hiding from us, mate?

Here.

Anybody here
lose family?

Anybody here lose family?

Are you
from an embassy?

My-- my daughter,
Martha Carter.

She's been seen in a truck up ahead,
and my wife Susan Carter.

I haven't found her yet.

Are you
from an embassy?

Did anybody actually
see the wave hit?

Are you press?
Yeah.

Go away.

Go away!
Chai?

Chai?

Hey!

Hey hey!

Jesus Christ.

Have you seen
my grandmother...?

My sister's children?
I found it.

I found it...

Ya?

Help... we need help.

Please help us
It's okay...

I'll get someone.

I'll get you some help.

Hey!

Easy, we're press.
We're press.

Let's go, let's go!
Nick!

Let's go.
Nick, come on!

Nick!

Nick, come here.
You okay?

Ah!

Let's go.
Nick, come on!

Ahhhh!

Jesus.

Where are they
taking them?

I don't know.
Come on, come on.

We've been
at the hospital.

They told us to come here.
Check your list again.

I'm looking for my father,
James Robert Peabody.

11th of the 11th, '60.

And my brother John David Peabody.
10th of the 9th, '88.

It's useless.

Look at this place.
Adam.

We just need
to keep searching.

Adam, don't--
excuse me.

Be careful.

I'll just be a minute.

I'll just be a minute.
I'm gonna check something.

There, Nick,
over there.

Chai.

Jesus.

It stinks.

You count Westerners,
I'll count Thai.

Okay okay.

Come on, man,
have some respect.

Your phone-- what
network are you on?

How much?
To buy your SIM-card?

No.

No no no!

No, you can't do this.
You can't burn these people.

You can't burn
these people.

Do their--
do their family know?

Do their family know?

You okay?
Take a photo!

Take a photo,
they're burning people!

They're burning...

Jesus.

Chai, take a picture.

Chai, take
the fucking picture.

Have you identified
these people?

Have you told
their families?

They're trying to stop infection.
There's too many of them.

Just take
the fucking picture, Chai.

There's plenty of shots
around the front.

Take the fucking picture.

Take the fucking--
Give it back, Nick!

Give it back.
Fuck you.

Give it back.
Fuck!

For fuck's sake.

This is what
they do, Nick.

They're monks.

What difference
does that make?

Nothing's moving.

The driver thinks there is
a small clinic in the hills.

In the other way.
They may have a doctor there.

No no, he needs a proper hospital.
He needs proper medical--

We should leave him here,
at the temple.

No.
They're burning bodies.

He won't be safe here.
His family...

they'll wanna bury him.

I have to find
my family.

Make sure he's okay.

His name's James.

He was staying
at the Khao Lak Oasis.

Don't leave him here.

Oliver! Go!

Run! Run!
The police are here!

It's just milk!

It's not for me.

I'm heading back
to my village.

There are people
trapped...

I can't find anyone
to help.

You've been stealing
from the tourists?

No-- they're
my grandmother's...

They took
her body away.

I'm looking
for my wife.

Oh...

I-I-- I saw... a bed,
it was empty.

Where do I go?

Ah...

Hang on a sec.

They're burning
unidentified bodies, Simone.

I saw... a woman,

a child.
I saw two men.

Westerners?
Yeah, Thais, too.

There's 50 or 60 bodies
lined up, ready to go.

Okay, Chai got shots?
Yeah, we'll send them to you now.

Shots from the beach,
give her those.

Back off, Nick.

They're burning
Westerners, Chai.

They're dead.
I got the shot.

It's my camera.
Those people have families, Chai.

You felt the heat today.
The monks have to protect the living,

and those bodies will
spread infection.

Yeah well, we like
our bodies in a box.

It's more than just
a souvenir to take home.

Families like
to gather together, say goodbye...

...maybe even say
the odd prayer.

It's what we
call a funeral.

Don't patronize me.
We syndicate that shot--

It's a good shot.
It says we don't care.

You don't get it because you don't
live your life like we do.

To us, the body is just a vessel,
what carries us through this life.

And when it dies, the spirit's
released into the next.

I'm sorry, Chai.

You saw the monks
helping people.

You saw them praying. But who cares
about that as long as you get the shot?

It'll stop it.
People will look at that shot,

and even though it's fine for you
to come here for holidays

and drop your tabs on the beach
and love the food, yeah?

That shot--
It'll make governments listen.

It slams us right back
into the Third World,

and that's fine for you.
You're not Thai.

I need a photo
of my wife and daughter.

I'm sorry?

I need to use
a phone.

Oh.

Here you go.

I sent one
to my dad yesterday.

Want me to do that
for you?

It's U.K.?
Yeah.

It's London.
0-2-0-7--

Mm-hmm.

Now it's ringing.

Hi, Dad.

Right.

BBC, CNN, Asian News,
they're all here.

Grab your powder puffs,
ladies.

Right, we need to get
our office set up.

Tony?

I'll set up a press briefing,
A.S.A.P.

No, I'd like to hit the hotel first.
Maybe a quick debrief.

Make sense of how
we're gonna coordinate things.

You're kidding,
right?

Tony, you're not going to be seeing
a hotel room for quite awhile.

They have it
upstairs.

Okay?

Well, the Aussies look
pretty settled.

Where do we sit?

I think people have got a grip
on what's actually happened here.

Excuse me,
excuse me.

Joe, clear all that stuff,
will you?

Are you
from the British consul?

Look, we're gonna need
some sort of flag--

Helen!
Maybe some notepaper.

And coffee--
I'm gonna need coffee.

Where the fuck
have you been?

I lost my son
and my daughters.

All right, all right, one at a time,
please. Just one at a time.

Joe, Joe, Joe!

What's your name, sir?

We're-- we're gonna need
some more volunteers.

All right, all right,
please--

Thanks.

We were just standing
on the beach.

We went back 'cause--

my wife...

she always wants her
to wear her water wings.

She was holding on
to a tree.

She's only six,
but she's--

she's got a real
strong grip.

What do you think?

She was holding on
to a tree.

I'd say your kid's
still alive.

"I'd say your kid's
still alive"?

...arriving here
in the disaster zone.

Britain's representative,
Tony Whittaker,

arrived early this morning,
and is here with me now.

Do you as yet
have any figure

as to how high the death toll
could climb?

It's really too early
to say, but what is clear

is that this is
a catastrophe for Thailand,

and indeed the whole
of the Andaman Coast.

Right now, we're trying to assess
which areas have been worst hit.

Khao Lak looks very bad.
Are you aware that bodies

are being burned in the temple
just outside of there?

There are a number of rumors--
No, I've seen the bodies.

Westerners and Thais being
cremated without identification.

I-- I'm following it up.
But, it's my understanding

that no Western bodies
are being cremated.

Their focus is very much

on the identification,
preservation and return

of those bodies to loved ones.
The Thai government--

That's really all we have time for.
There's a lot to do.

Get London
on the phone.

Excuse me?
Excuse me, I'm--

we're-- I'm trying to find
my husband and my son,

but nobody-- nobody seems
to know where we should be.

Have you tried talking
to your tour operator?

I don't have a tour operator.
We organized this holiday ourselves.

We're hoping to arrange
some evacuation flights,

but at the present
it's impractical.

Is that Mark?

Uh--
Mark?

Nice one, Mom.

If you can
head back to Krabi,

I'll head up as far North
as I can.

Let's cover five villages
each today.

That's fifteen between us.

Hi, Kathy speaking.

Mm-hmm?

I'm looking for my father
and my brother.

Here, take this.

I don't want
a bar of soap.

Adam, look,
calm down.

They could be dead.

Hey hey.

I don't need
a bar of soap.

No, but you do
need some sleep.

Across the street and to the left,
they've opened up

the college gym.
You can get a bed and a hot shower.

You should take
all you can right now.

You don't know how long
it's gonna last.

Thank you,
thanks.

It's James...

sorry.

It's okay.

James Robert Peabody.

11th of the 11th, 1960;

and John David Peabody,
10th of the 9th, '88.

Yes, they're
on the list.

Okay.

Thank you.

Next, please.

We're moving.
Joe's found us a proper office

around the corner
with air conditioning.

You got room
for another one?

It's really just
for U.K. use.

I've got 600 children
missing, Tony.

So far I know 12 of them
are still alive.

It's a bit
rough and ready.

"Chaos is a friend
of mine."

It's Bob Dylan.

So what are you saying?

No one's
picking up the story.

You're kidding me?

There are no Westerners
on the photo.

There was a woman,
she had light brown hair...

she's probably
European.

Yeah, she looks black,
bloody and dead.

Look, your word isn't enough
for anyone to print it. It's too risky.

They're burning Thais.
Adds up to the same thing.

They're incinerating people
without identification.

It's been stopped.
Someone yelled at the Thais.

Reuters just
tipped me off.

The story's done.
Move on.

People need evidence.

I gave you evidence.

Next Christmas
I'm going to Malibu.

This is
a 20-minute walk.

15 if you're brisk.

You're not worried that people
won't be able to find you?

Phone sockets,
internet points.

We've got more volunteers arriving
tomorrow. They'll need every line.

We can field calls, relatives
can make "missing" posters.

You'll need a contact point
in every hospital.

Yeah, I think if we
make this our base...

Khao Lak is over
an hour away.

It's a long way to walk
if you've lost your family

and all your money
and don't speak Thai.

Just an observation.

Good good.
If you want to get some tea going?

Call's just come through.
Attaché's arriving at 4:00.

Hello?

Yeah.

I'm lost.

Come.
Come sit down.

I need to get back
to my village!

There are people
trapped...

Please...
Please let me out.

Is this it?

Came through
from your dad.

Shall I?

They're some
of my kids.

I work with
an education program,

mainly in
the fishing villages.

Those are the ones
we've found so far.

That's good.
It's a start.

Maybe you should try
and get some sleep?

Ian!

Oh my God!

Susan!

Susan, I thought
you were dead.

I thought-- I thought you--
I thought you were dead.

The boat came back,
everything was gone.

Everything--
the chalet, the hotel,

it was all gone.
Where's Martha?

Where's Martha?
She was with you.

We were-- we were coming back
to the hotel. She got hold of a tree,

I don't know where she is.

No no, she's alive.
Susan, Martha's-- Martha's alive.

This guy, he said he
saw her, just outside--

What guy saw her?
This guy.

She wasn't letting go.

Nothing was gonna
make her let go, see?

She's alive.
We're gonna find her.

Baby...

never leave me again.
No.

You never leave me.

Oh no.

We're gonna
find her, baby.

We're gonna find her.

Hi, Ralph.
Hey, Nick.

Ron.

Wanker.

Here.

Thanks.

How come is all the
palm trees still standing

and the buildings
are gone?

There you are.
Do we have a rebuilt timeline?

Too early to tell.

You've got figures?
700 missing.

At Khao Lak Oasis,
the occupancy was around 300.

Jesus.

I need to get
more information.

Right.

Let's go.

Let's go.
I'm not done.

You okay?

Here.

Put some of this
around your nose.

It helps
with the smell.

Thanks.

Ellen. Ellen Webb.

I work for S.Q.A. Hotels,
managing their properties down here.

Nick Fraser,
East Asia Press.

I was just here
a couple of weeks ago.

We've got hotels
all over the world, but this place--

Mm.

this was really special.

People come here to forget the shit
in their lives and then this happens.

700 missing guests,

that's a lot of unpaid
room service, isn't it?

That's not
what I meant.

Will you be offering some kind
of compensation package?

I just manage
the properties.

I just gotta--
I've just gotta see someone.

Hi.
Hi.

We were staying
at the same hotel.

Yeah.

Everyone is calling this
a natural disaster.

I don't know what's natural
about something

that flips
the world on its head.

People monitor earthquakes,
don't they?

It doesn't make sense.

Your husband's dead.

He, um, he died en route
to the hospital.

Yesterday.

About...

it was late.

I don't know
where his body is.

I had to leave him

just north of Khao Lak.

I'm sorry.

Mom!

There's a John Peabody
at Takua Pa Clinic.

He's injured, but--

Please...

don't tell my son yet.

Please.

We're going that way.

Someone said they're
burning the bodies.

What do you mean?

The monks.
They're trying to clear space.

There's too many dead--
Adam. Stop it.

Dad's not here.
We need to take care of John now.

Dad was half cut
when we left him.

It probably hit him
when he was still in bed--

I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry.

Dad'll be okay.
I have to go.

Take it, take it.

Susan, Susan!

Susan!

We need to deal
with John now.

And Daddy...

he'd want me
to look after John.

Susan! Don't go
in there, babe.

What if she's dead, Ian?
What if they've burned her body?

Well, you'd just
left the beach.

You'd already--
you'd already been swimming.

She was wearing
her water wings.

No, we were going back
to the room. I'd left them in the room.

She wasn't wearing them?

I had her
in my arms.

You let go?

She got hold
of a tree.

If we go back...

You didn't feel it,
Suze.

You couldn't.

If we go back
to the tree...

Come on, baby.

We'll find her,
we'll find her, baby.

Come on, come on.

Come on.

Careful.

Excuse me?

Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I'm looking for my son?

Do you speak English?

Mom.

Tony. There's a boy
at a clinic in Takua Pa.

John Peabody, 16 years old,
he's badly injured.

His mother called while you were out
and she needs a flight evacuation.

There are spaces on the commercial
charters if need be.

Do people know that?

The second team
arrive tomorrow.

I'll post someone out there
as soon as it's feasible.

His mother's pretty
distressed.

We have limited resources, Kathy.
I have to coordinate the volunteers

as best as I can.
Yeah, I know but--

Why don't you just let me
get on with my job

and you get back to yours?
Kathy?

They've arrested some
of the villagers

for looting food
and water.

I can get an official
down here.

One phone call.

Have they been given
food and water?

Does anyone need a lift
to their village?

I need to get
to Kaw Tai village...

They took
Grandmother's bracelets...

No, Mr. Whittaker's
not here at the moment.

What time
will he be back?

He's on an inspection tour,
but there is an open meeting

tonight at the town hall
if you want to ask any questions.

Does anybody-- does anybody in the U.K.
even know what's happening here?

People can't get home.
We don't have any money.

We-- we can't find
our daughter.

You understand?
This is madness.

Ian, Ian!

She's at Takua Pa Clinic.

Oh my God.

It's her?

It's her.

It is her.

Come on.

Hey hey, Takua Pa?
Takua Pa.

Takua Pa.

I think he's just
dehydrated,

but he has a cut
on his side.

I'm going around
in circles.

Been calling
the help line.

They just say,
"Go to your embassy."

I'll see what
I can do but--

When Dad gets here--

Your dad's not
getting here, is he?

Who says?

Who says?

Adam...

Dad's--
Dad's dead, darling.

Okay.

Call them again.

What'll they do?

Give us another wash bag
and a mat in the gym?

I want someone here now.
Someone with authority.

Someone who can
get my son home.

These-- these two boys
are all I've got

and I will not lose
another member of my family.

Phuket town hall.
Tonight there's a meeting

for British survivors.

You're his mother.

There's no one better to convince them
if you want John on a flight.

You stay here with your brother.
Don't move.

All right?

Martha, Martha Carter?

Martha Carter--
she's down as, um, 573

at your website.
Over there.

Martha baby?

It's, uh, we're looking
at the wrong girl.

It's the wrong--

It's not her.

It looked like her.

Photo all scratched up...
Yeah.

She looked like her.

We could take her.

She's got no parents.

Maybe she's lost her parents,
we could take her.

Susie, baby.

We can't take her, no.

I should never have
left Martha.

I should never have
left her with you.

That's a very pretty dress
that dolly has on.

You have a duck here.

That the duck
to kiss the dolly?

You might want to change
to a Thai network, love.

Sorry?

I said you might want
to change to a Thai network.

For some reason,
their masts were barely hit.

Or you could use
the public phone.

But my friend might
be some time.

You've got a friend.

Yes, I have.

Technology's never
been my thing.

Anything technical,
I always defer to him.

First rule in life.

Always trust the geeks.

Thanks for the tip.

You are most welcome.

You know who he is?

Should I?

Maybe.

Hello, Dr. Meeko.

Boonma.

Look at you,
all smartened up.

Have a seat.

You've been waiting
for this moment a long time.

How can I help you?

On behalf
of the Thai government...

I've a proposition to make,
Dr. Meeko.

Than?
Be back in a sec.

Hey hey.

I have to get back
to my village.

There are people
still alive.

I have to do something.

The villagers have all
run to the hills.

Okay. Okay.

Let's get you cleaned up.

I'll drive you down there.

It'll be okay.

Holy shit.

Tony, the meeting's starting.
We've got to go.

Just coming.

I've been here since last night.
And what have you done? Nothing.

Please, I know you all have questions,
but in a natural disaster of this sort--

No. No.

No.

No, I last saw my daughter
36 hours ago.

She was screaming
for help.

She was alone.

And she was afraid.

There is nothing natural
about any of this.

I appreciate--
I want my daughter back.

I want her here,
and I want her now.

You have to tell me
how to do this.

Because I'm not leaving
until you do.

Until all of us...

get our kids back.

Believe me, I am going
to do everything I can to help you--

My wife is dead.
I want her body back.

My-- my son is lying
in Takua Pa Clinic.

He will die if he
isn't evacuated tonight.

Can you guarantee we're
gonna get our bodies back?

As far we know, there are
up to 10,000 British nationals

in Thailand at this time.
You can appreciate

they're trying to coordinate
with the Thai government

and the other foreign embassies
to locate and identify

as many bodies as we can
as quickly as possible,

and to repatriate people,
either to medevac...

...commercial flights
to get home as soon as possible.
