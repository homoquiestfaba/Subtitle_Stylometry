Thank you for the help.
[Maddy] Thank you so much.

I'll see you soon, thank you.

[indistinct Chatter]

I mean how about this?

What are the chances, huh?

Yeah, that wasn't forced at all.

No, not at all.

No, it wasn't.

It was like fate, too thick.

Come on, well,
you look a little flattered.

You always flatter me, Rex.

Against my will, no less.

Okay.

Okay, I'll take that.

Well, hey, picture this,
though.

Maybe the whole evenin' of it.

That flattery, I mean, not...

Unless it goes that way, which...

What can I do for you?


[lizard bank robber] Everybody,

Everyone move where I can
fuckin' see you.

Go, go, go!

He said,
"On the fucking ground now!"

Fuckin get down on the ground!

[demon bank robber]
Everyone, shut the fuck up!

[demon bank robber] We gotta
make this short and sweet.

So listen up your names.

Olivia Beatty.

Robert Bell.

[demon bank robber]
Madeline Augustine.

And Angela Reynolds.

All of you up
with your tills open.

Ken King, I'm c... c-
coming for you

and your c... c... c...
combination.

Chop, chop motherfuckers.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

While he's doin' that,
all of you hold up your wallets,

fucking billfolds, money clips,
take 'em out,

and hold 'em above your head.

[werewolf bank robber]
I promise you'll be able

to go about your business
very soon.

And thank you
for your cooperation.

Get the fuck out
from under there.

[werewolf bank robber] Hands
where I can fuckin' see 'em.

Now!



[werewolf bank robber]
Wallets up!

Any resistance will be met
with a broken fuckin' face!

[cowering bank customer] Please,
please, I don't have any money,

that's why I'm here.

He says he ain't got anything!

What did I just fuckin' say?


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

moment, Mr. Coen decided

that it was his place

to put the lives of everyone
in that bank

in further danger.

And without hesitation,

without any care or concern

that's exactly what he did.

Those poor souls.

denyin' the heroic nature

of Mr. Coen's intentions
and actions.

No.

No, no, no.

No!

Alright, everybody get up!

Get out, I got this.

He may have meant well...

Stop, stop! Stop, stop...

But this wasn't self-defense.

Stop!

Hold it right there.

This was madness.

[Juror narrating] The fact that he
caused an unnecessary death proves

he's a danger to society.

[Rex's attorney] Rex,
this isn't gonna go your way,

so the DA's offered a plea.

[Rex's attorney]
I think you should consider it.

What?

No?

[Rex's attorney] Rex,
if the jury wants to make a statement,

you can get 20 years
just for count 1.

I was called a "hero"
three times,

were you not listening?

Put that up
against the innocent death

they believe you caused.

Okay, so what then?

[Rex's attorney]
The DA's offered eight years.

[Rex's attorney] No parole, no
probation, you serve the term in full.

Do your time,
you're free and clear.

[police officer]
Keep walkin'!

I am not gonna tell you again.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm on a magazine?

Here you go.

Have a nice day.

[indistinct announcement]

[indistinct Chatter]

Did you find everything okay?

Yeah.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

And uh, this, too.

Fuck.

Expired.

Holy shit!

What?


[indistinct speech]

[paparazi 1] Oh, heavens,
great, it's Rex Coen.

[paparazi 2] Hey, Rex. Rex!
[paparazi 3] Hey, Rex.

[paparazi 1] Hey, how does your
first day of freedom feel, man?

[paparazi 1] You can say somethin'
about how you miss Boise?

Looks like you gettin' some love
and some hate.

[indistinct Chatter]

[Rex's conscience]
â™ª Nobody knows â™ª

â™ª The trouble I've seen â™ª

â™ª Nobody knows â™ª

[Rex's conscience]
â™ª My sorrow â™ª

[paparazi 3] Have you spoken
with her since you've been back?

â™ª Nobody knows â™ª

[paparazi 3] Can you
tell us how you two uh

Did she come to visit you?

â™ª The trouble I've seen â™ª

Fuck off!

Fuck out of here!

[Rex's conscience]
They're such pricks.

What are they doing?

[paparazi 4]
Rex, do you have PTSD?

How much do you think they get
for these, by the way,

anyway, you know, like what?

[Rex's conscience]
100 a pop?

[overlapping speech]

[Rex's conscience]
200?

You gotta be at least worth 200,
right?

[paparazi 1] We never got
the full story of the bank.

You think you can give us
some a little insight?

[paparazi 3] Have you
spoken with the girl, Maddy?

Have you spoken with her
since you've been back?

Don't do it.

[overlapping conversation]

Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, hey.

[overlapping conversation]

Don't do it.

[paparazi 1]
You still talk to her?

Don't, don't do it.


[overlapping conversation]

I saw that.

[overlapping conversation]

Holy Mother of God.

Whoa!

and back from the d...

What's with your hair up here?

You're gonna be on the news.

Sorry.

[indistinct Chatter]

â™ª I never felt the feeling â™ª

Dude, that is fuckin' nuts!

I still wouldn't believe it.

I mean fucking Jason Bourne
over here!

Holy shit!

Hey, listen to me.

You gotta write a book, man.

Did you tell anybody else?

Haven't been to see
anybody else.

Oh, uh...

Wait a minute.

So nobody from the bank
has told that story?

Well, no.

I mean nobody had
your point of view.

Mm, what about the girl?


She came once.

Once, wow!

Huh, that's a bitch.

I visited you more than that.

Yeah, twice.

Mmhmm.

And no, you know what?

She just... she found her life.

That's all.

Oh, you wanna go play a round?

I ain't doin' nothin'.

No, no, no, no.

No, I'm not gonna play golf,
Pete.

How was Shawshank anyway?

Hmm?

Did you uh...

[clears throat]

Get, you know?

Uh...

Hey dude, listen to me,
I don't judge...

Hmm.
[Pete] Alright?

You gotta do
what you gotta do...

Pete.

And it's a jungle in there.
[Rex] Pete, Pete.

If you ever wanna talk
to somebody...

Pete!

Where's my shit?

people are really acting

like you're a celebrity

ever since your release
re-sparked the old debate.

Debate about what?

About what you did, man.

You know, some people think
you're a hero

and others, well...

Think I'm a psycho twat?

Fuckin' psycho twat.

shit I've ever been called.

I mean you're only getting that,

because they don't know
what went on inside the bank.

I just told you.

buried that shit, man.

All we saw was the trial
and that censored YouTube clip,

which was badass, by the way.

Well, maybe I should write
that fuckin' book.

Yeah, I mean some versions
of the story,

you're like the...
the Dark Knight,

in others, you're the Joker.

What do you think?

Oh, I know.

Yeah.

Boom.

So where to next?

Finland.

What?

I kinda meant where to in Boise.

Why Finland?

Well, a very scientific,
very calculated reason.

What's that?

I shot a spitball at a map.

Wait, that is
the stupidest fucking thing

I've ever heard.

Just ask Joe
for your job back here you know,

for a start.

You're not thinkin'
about going back

to the military, though, right?

You know, an all-new adventure
in a foreign land.

No baggage, nobody knowing
who the fuck I am.

It sounds like paradise.

[afraid man]
Help me!

Help me, please!

Help!

Someone!

Help me, please!

[twin 1 shushing]


No!

[fan boy]
Hey, it's you.

It's you!

It's you!

It's me.

Uh, that was a very great thing
you did, sir.

Very great.

[fan boy]
Very brave.

Uh, you would have
done the same.

[fan boy]
No, no, I wouldn't have.

[speaking in Finnish]

[speaking in Finnish]

Takin' a vacation, Mr. Hero?

Why you leaving, Mr. Wick?

Mr. John Wick.

[fan boy chuckling]

[Finnish passenger] You know,
they were speaking about you.

Mr. Wick, hey, hero.

That couple,
they were speaking about you.

Oh, I'm sure they were.

They said they want
to get you.

[fan boy] Hero, hey, hero.
[Rex] What?

Wait, wait a minute,
they wanna get me.

What does that mean?

I don't know.

They said they were planning
on getting you.

Hey, hey, hey.

Said you looked perfect
for their son.

[Finnish passenger]
Whatever that means.

[fan boy] When you were in that
bank, how did you know exactly

what you were gonna do?

That's funny.

It's funny, it's a joke.

[Finnish passenger]
Probably.

Yeah.

"Black humor", I think,
you Americans would call it.

Right.

You know, lots have gone missing
in Helsinki over the years.

[fan boy]
So what's in Finland?

Lots.

You got some bad guys
to fight over there, too?

You be careful.

[fan boy] Hey,
if you ever come to my home country,

you and I... wait, hey.

Freaked out?

Okay.

Yeah, well, hey,
good luck to 'em, right?

You, too.
[fan boy] That's right.

No one messes
with Captain America!

[indistinct announcement]

[fan boy]
[speaks in foreign language]

[Rex's conscience]
You could take 'em.

You won't have to,
but you could.

They're just another couple
of crazy fans.

They don't wanna "get" you.

What does that even mean?

It was a pretty creepy smile,
though.


Oh my God!

He definitely wants to get you!


Chuck your dick away, quick.


[airport announcer 1] This is
the pre-boarding announcement.

Flight LS107 to Helsinki.

We are now inviting
those passengers

with small children

and any passenger requiring
special assistance

to board at this time.

"Boi to hel."

Uh, fuck me, right?

â™ª Oh, Finland â™ª

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey, excuse me, what is that?

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

what the fuck are you doing?

Hey!


Hey!


Hey, what the fuck!

What the fuck are you doing?


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

"Fee, Fye, Fo, Fum.

I smell the blood
of an American.

Be he alive or be he dead.

I'll grind his bones
to make my bread."

"'Nonsense, dear',
said his wife.

'You're dreaming
or perhaps you smell the scraps

of that little boy
you liked so much

for yesterday's banquet.'"

Banquet?

[speaks Finnish]

Banquet.

Good.

"So off the ogre went,

and Jack was just
going to jump out of the oven,

and run away
when the woman pulled him."

[Pati growling in distance]




[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Don't let them hear you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[taking deep breaths]

[taking deep breaths]

How?

I don't know.

It's impossible.

[Rex's conscience]
Obviously not.

No.

No, no, it's not possible.

Obviously.

Obviously not

and don't let them
fuckin' hear you!

Them?

Them?

Who's them?

No.

Not not them.

No.

The airport?

The creepy couple?

Is that what this is?

Or the most fucked up
coincidence in history.

And keep your voice down.

How?

How?

[lyrics in Finnish]

They got you.

[Rex sobbing]

How?

How?

How?

How come?

I have no fucking idea!

I have no idea!

[Rex's conscience]
Let me ask you something.

Why'd you pick Finland, huh?

Of all the fuckin' places
on the planet why Finland?

Why did you choose
fucking Finland?

Fuck!

[Rex's conscience]
Fuck!

How?


[Rex's conscience]
Okay, you know what?

If you're gonna insist
on asking that question,

I suggest you apply it
to figuring out how

to undo those knots
and get the fuck out of here,

because guess what, pal?

Hey, you're here
and it doesn't matter how.

It doesn't matter why.

You are here!

[Rex's conscience]
Welcome to paradise.


Okay, okay.

What do we know
and what do we need to know?

My leg's missing.

It's quiet and it's dark.

It's gotta be about the middle
of the night, I guess.

[Rex's conscience]
I don't know.

We need to know
how much time we have.

If you can't undo those knots
by dawn,

it's gonna be big trouble
in little Finland.


[Rex's conscience]
Now, we know

this ain't even close
to their first rodeo.

[Rex's conscience]
What we need to know

is there anything useful
in those bags?

Now, that looks like
polyester staple rope

tied up in triple knots.

If you can't tie knots,
tie lots.

Yeah, we know they have
confidence in that rope,

because your mouth ain't gagged
and your leg's swinging free.

Either that or they know
it'll take more time

than you have.

Or I'm not supposed to be awake.

Five years ago, Dr. Orso,
I woke up durin' the root canal.

Let's play it safe

and say it's about 4:00
in the morning.

I hope it's 1:00.

Well, heck, I hope it's fuckin'
ABC fuckin' Prime Time

up in this bitch,

but let's play it safe
and say it's 4:00.

so you bein' awake gives us
a considerable advantage.

I'm a cripple.

Yeah, let's talk about that.

Why aren't you dead?

You should be.

[Rex's conscience] They
prevented you from bleeding out.

Why?

And why your leg, huh?

They can't possibly be
medical professionals,

judging by the look
of this pathetic hack job,

but I don't know.

Black market human limb trade,
is that a thing?

I'm pretty sure in Serbia...

Can we go back
to me not dying, please?

Right.

Right, right, right,
yeah, okay.

So a dead Rex
would be a useless Rex.

Apparently.

So they're keeping you alive
to keep your parts from rotting!

I don't know.

I mean I guess that makes sense
for the uh, organ trade deal,

but you've still got
your kidneys, your lungs,

your heart.

What good is just one leg?

[lyrics in Finnish]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's a fuckin' family.

[lyrics in Finnish]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Let's get out of here.
Yeah.

[Rex's conscience] You think
you can gnaw that shit off?

[mimics gnawing]

Come on, teeth.


Hey, I'm lighter


Okay.

You see?

[Rex's conscience]
Hey, hey!

Not the time.

Alright.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[speaks Finnish]
Good night.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


It's fiber.


Come on, come on!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

What is it?

What?

Answers.

Here it comes.

That's 2:00 a.m.

[Rex's conscience]
Hoo-hoo!

Let's go hard,
can you show me what you got?

Let's go.




Fuck!

Fuck is that?

Oh, fuck!

[taking deep breaths]

Okay, maybe...

We need a backup plan.

How did that dude get away
from the crazy bitch

in that movie Misery?

Uh, he uh...

He used the story
he was writing

as his insurance policy.

Wow.

As long as he had it,
she couldn't kill him.

She needed it.

He used it as leverage,
and then he destroyed it,

and bashed her head in
with a typewriter.

Yeah, we need
an insurance policy.

And a typewriter.

Man.

Asleep!

Asleep!

You're asleep!

[Rex's conscience]
Is this it?

Oh, shit!

Is this it?

[Rex's conscience]
I have nothing!

Fuck!

Fuck it!

Fuck it all!

I have nothing!

Oh, this is no good at all!

[Rex's conscience]
I have nothing!

Is it them?

They're just looking.

It's okay,
I think they're only looking.

It's okay, it's okay.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Rex's conscience]
It's a boy.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

That's just a little boy.

As if this shit
couldn't get me creepier!

Well, here's the good news.

Here's our insurance policy.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Rex's conscience] Hey, you know,
what would be funny is if you tore

this little asshole's leg off,

and then stuck it to yourself,

and then walked upstairs
as if nothing was wrong.

[Rex's conscience chuckling]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Banquet.

[taking deep breaths]

What the fuck?

[Rex's conscience]
Stop him!

Wait, wait, wait,
wait, um...

[speaks Spanish]
Stop!

Spanish, really?

I don't know.

Whatever.

Reel him in.

Slowly.

Hey, hey.

Kid.

Come here.

[taking deep breaths]

Yeah, yeah,
come here, come here.

God, I wish I knew some Finnish.

Come, you come.

You.


You think he speaks English?

Do you speak English?

You do?

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Oh, but he is so gonna hurt you.

[Rex's conscience chuckling]

Huh, look at that, you got him.


It's okay, don't be scared.

I just wanna know your name.

And to use you
as delicious bait.

Olavi.

What's your name?

Ola...


[Rex taking deep breaths]

[Rex's conscience]
Holy shit!

Holy shit!

Holy fucking shit, man!


Whoo!

Olavi?

Now, what do we do?

[taking deep breaths]

Hold tight.

[taking deep breaths]

[speaking in Finnish]

Olavi.

His name's Olavi?


I thought he was saying "hola".

He reacted when I spoke to him
in Spanish.


Quiet.

Please.

I know that feeling, trust me.

[taking deep breaths]

Do you speak English?

I'm not gonna hurt you or him.

Again.

[taking deep breaths]

Do you speak English?


Do you speak English?

You do, you do.

Great, okay.

He's not dead.

I can feel his pulse.

I might have broken his nose,
though.

I'm sorry about that.

I felt like I had to.

My name is Rex.

Pleasure is all mine.

I'd offer you my hand, but well,
you'd probably keep it.

I'm kidding, that's a joke.

Um, well, not really.

Kinda.

What's your name?

Uh, no.

No, no, no.

Hey, hey, here we go.

Back up here.

Hey,
before you do anything rash,

know that all I have to do
is squeeze.

So you and I are gonna make
a little deal

with each other, okay?

If you let me go,
I'll let him go.

Alright?

In fact, I'm gonna make it
even easier for you.

All you gotta do is
give me that knife right there

and I'll release him.

That's all.

It's all you have to do.

What do you say?

[Rex's conscience]
Damn!

What a sexy little psychopath,
huh?

What's she doin'?

She gonna help you or kill you?

Help you or kill you?

Hey, is she gonna help you
or kill you?

I don't know!

You don't know what?

Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck!


So do we have a deal?

Knife, knife.

Get the knife!


Hey, no, come on.

You don't wanna do this.

You don't wanna to do this.

Look at me, look at me!

You're not like them.

Are you?

[taking deep breaths]

Are you?

[taking deep breaths]

Well done, fuckhead!

We have to get out of
here now!

[taking deep breaths]

Ollie.


Ollie!

[taking deep breaths]

[taking deep breaths]

[speaking in Finnish]

[taking deep breaths]

Did they all just leave?


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



[speaking in Finnish]

Oh.

[speaking in Finnish]


[Rex's conscience]
That Finnish chick, though.


What?

[Rex's conscience]
What?

She was sexy.

You saw her.

She's a murderer.

[Rex's conscience]
Yeah, I'm not convinced, though.

She was covering her eyes.

Why would she be
covering her eyes?

[Rex grunting]

Now is not the time to play...

[Rex grunting]

Psychotherapist
to the fuckin' Manson Family.

[Rex's conscience]
I'm not saying we do that.

I'm just saying
I'm not convinced

that she was a murderer.

[Rex's conscience]
That's all.

Well, you've been wrong
before, so

What?

When?

Oh, I don't know.

Uh, "They're just fans.

They don't wanna get you.

What does that even mean?"

Huh?

[Rex's conscience]
That's you!

Oh, give me a break.

You...

Yes, I did!

Okay.


Yes, I did.

Well, yeah, okay of course,
if the opportunity arises,

we will do that.

That's not what I'm arguin'
and fuck this!

[taking deep breaths]

How'd they take it?

Not too well, I'm guessing.

Where'd they take him?

The hospital, yeah?


Did they all leave?

What'd you tell 'em?

Hey, why am I still alive?

wait, wait, what is that?

What is that?

A butcher Barbie play set?

Another joke.

What?

What are you gonna do?

Just remember to breathe.



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



Breathe.

I can breathe.

Breathe.

Definitely breathing.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's for the circulation.

It's working.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm Alia.

I like you.

I have no idea what to do
with that.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What would you do with this?

With that?

Um, off the top of my head,
I would uh...

I would free myself
and kill your family you know,

pretty standard stuff.

What?

You can't.

Well, I could, but uh,

I'm guessing you
wouldn't like that very much.

My family, they're insane.

No!

Well, I wouldn't say that.

No.

But you can't kill them.

Hey, listen, no offense,

but fuck that, they're dead.

[Rex chuckles]

No, I mean really you can't.

Like you won't be able.

Then we'll leave.

They will find us.

You don't know that.

How do you know that?

'Cause they always do.

And when they do,
we will pay.

This is all because of him,
because of Pati.

Who the fuck is Pati?

Oh, he's my brother.

The oldest and hungriest.

He's the reason you're here

and very soon there will be
nothing left of you.

Is she sayin'

Are you saying

that you're...

that I'm

Lunch?

And dinner.


He was born a monster

with a taste for only one thing.

[uncle grunting]

[baby crying]

They tried alternatives

and for a while
it seemed to work.


But when he had a craving,

there was never
any other option.

The hunger was insatiable.

So finally, they gave in

to the one solution
they'd been avoiding.

[American backpacker]
Mmm, this is awesome.

Thank you so much.

You're very welcome.

I was literally starving.

You're a real lifesaver.


[Pati growling]


[Pati growling]


[Pati growling]

[Pati growling]

[Pati growling]


[Pati growling]


[Pati growling]

never grew out of it.

Night after night,
I saw more and more death.

More and more blood.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

For years, I tried,
but they always found me.

So when Ollie was born,
I had no choice but to try

and save him from these horrors.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


But it was pointless.

Phew!

And they found a way,
as they always did,

to make sure that I would
never ever leave again.

And for years, I haven't.




All I've ever wanted was
for someone

to come save me
from this horrible place.

Hello?

Lady, I am right here!

Your crazy-ass family...
please, don't walk away.

gone, okay?

I've got a head start on him.

Hmm, alright?

So just toss me the knife

and we can get the fuck out
of here.

You and me both of us,
we'll blow this joint.

Come on, you and me.

Come on, come on.

This won't change anything,
as much as I wish it would.

[taking deep breaths]

I know I'm just
committing suicide, but

[taking deep breaths]

good, by the way.

Insatiable?

It's... well, it's insatiable,
but it's good.

It's really good.

Thanks.

Yeah.

[taking deep breaths]

I wasn't meant for this life.

They knew it.


But never did they care.


I've seen so many die.

Well, I kinda figured that,
so


No, no, I never wanted to.

They forced me to feed him.

But I never in my heart felt
like they do.


I have dreams to heal,
not destroy.


I want to be a doctor.


Yeah, well, I'm sure
you get a lot of practice

in this fuckin' place.


I wish Pati was never born.

I never wanted to be part of it.

That's why they hate me so much.

I've fed people to my

Well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, I talk to myself
you know,

so we all have issues,
you know?

Why?

Um, why what?

Why do you talk to yourself?

It was something I picked up
while I was in prison.

Bitch, I've been with you
for longer than that.

You were in prison?

I was, yeah.

Hello?

Afghanistan?

OEFA?

Why?

It's a long story.

Tell me.

I'd love to, I really would.

I'd love nothing more,
but now really isn't the time.

Oh, and I'm sure you forget
about the bank already

then, huh?


Hey, but I'll tell you what.

If we get out of here,

I'll tell you the whole story
over dinner.

What do you say, huh?

I'll even pay, huh?


You're not vegan though,
are you?

'Cause that'd be a turn off.

What's a vegan?

Uh, a vegan is like a person,
but a...

I'm assuming
you shouldn't be here.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


What?

[Rex's conscience]
Son of a mother...

Hang in there whatever happens.

You.

I can't wait
to end your miserable life,

you fucking psycho twat!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I have to go now.

How will you get by 'em?

I'll find a way.


Bloody hell.



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Kill them all.


What the fuck?

He fuckin' shoot himself?

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Oh no â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª I know you comin' â™ª

â™ª I know you comin' â™ª

â™ª I know you comin' â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Oh yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª Come on now â™ª

â™ª Down, down, down, down,
down, down, down, down â™ª

[demon bank robber]
Right there.

He's right there,
you fuckin' idiot!

â™ª Oh â™ª

[man 2]
Dude, have you seen this shit?

[man 3]
What is it?

It's a bank getting robbed.

A fuckin' robbery.

[indistinct Chatter]

[man 4] Some dude goes
apeshit on the robbers.

This is fuckin' sick.

He took his fuckin' gun.

Wow!

[man 5] Oh shit, dude,
watch, watch, watch, watch.

Hands are up, alright?

Holy shit.

[woman 1] Oh, he's gonna to shoot
him, he's gonna shoot him.

[man 7] Let's not watch that...
[man 2] Would you stop?

Well, you should watch,
it's comin', it's comin'.

[man 3] Oh, what the fuck!
Oh!

Oh, come on!

They always censor
the good shit.

[demon bank robber] He's right
there, you fuckin' idiot!


â™ª Ooh â™ª

[werewolf bank robber]
Hands are up, alright?

Okay?

[werewolf bank robber]
Just take it easy.

[Rex's conscience]
Hit, hit, hit.

[werewolf bank robber]
Wait.

Wait, wait, wait!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This guy is badass.

â™ª Come on now â™ª

â™ª Come on, come on â™ª

[demon bank robber]
What the fuck are you doing?

â™ª You gotta like this â™ª

No, no.

No!



Fuck.

get up and get out, I got this.

[Maddy grunting]

Oh, hang tight back there.

I'll only be a moment.

[indistinct Chatter]

Come on, let's go!

I personally wouldn't recommend.

And that's turning his back
on the remaining threat.

You'll see in a second
why he does,

but with the backroom still full
of employees

and an active shooter,

he's takin' a big risk
by leaving them behind.

What he does instead
is approach

one of the downed gunmen.

What he says, we can't hear.


Was it worth it?

Hmm?


You move again,

I'll run my foot
down your fuckin' throat, okay?

[taking deep breaths]

Suck my balls.

No, that's disgusting.

Yippee ki...

No, it's been done.

I still... fuck.

Time to die, hell boy.

Boom!

Shotgun number 3.

denyin' the heroic nature

of Mr. Coen's intentions
and actions.

But his reckless approach
and chaotic manner,

which he felt was
absolutely necessary

to meet his personal fantasies,

cost an innocent mother
her life.

well, but his rash decisions

left Angela Reynolds dead.

[Maddy grunting]

[demon bank robber]
Hold it right there, Charlie.

I'll blow her head off.

Gun down or she dies.

Okay.

Then you die, you know that,
right?


You want this girl to die?

Honestly, I don't give a fuck,

I do wanna shoot you, though,
real bad.

Shoot him in the dick.

I'm gonna count to 3,
and only 3...

And then you die

You know, I get it.

I get it.

Shoot him in the dick.

This wasn't self-defense.

This was madness.

1, 2, 3...

[demon bank robber]
Fuck, man, stop.

What are you doing?

[demon bank robber] Fucking just...
I don't wanna die today.

You don't wanna die today.

She doesn't wanna die today.

So drop our weapons,

and I'll book her
to the back door,

and be out of your hair.

No fuss, no muss.

[demon bank robber]
All cool?

[Rex's attorney] Would you agree,
Mr. Coen, that it was your actions

that led to the death
of Ms. Reynolds?

No,

because they murdered the guard
upon entry.

They weren't hesitant
to start the shooting

and they wanted us all
to see blood at their hands.

incidences of violence from them.

Unprovoked.

They were the ones having fun
with the violence,

I just acted

before it became
something bigger.

[demon bank robber]
All cool?

Maddy.

See, in my mind

I want you to very carefully,
very slowly

and with my military training

stand up.

we were all witness
to a murder

Huh, she's not goin' anywhere.

I thought you didn't
wanna die today.


And personally I don't feel

that they were
gonna let any of us go.

So no.

Get up, come over here.

Get behind me.

I'd say it was their actions
that led

to Ms. Reynolds' death.

Don't you fuckin' move, fuck.

Not mine.

[demon bank robber] Don't you fuckin'
move, don't fuckin'...

It's okay.

Don't listen to him.

Mr. Coen had won.

It was over.

No one else had to be harmed.

But that wasn't good enough,
was it, Mr. Coen?

We're cool, yeah?

Alright.

Shoot him in the dick!



Fuck.

Why?

Why wasn't it good enough?

Why the need
to immobilize the perpetrator

in such a barbaric,
inhumane way?

Well, I wanted him down

and I didn't want him
to reproduce.

It's a win, win.

I felt like you meant it.

I didn't.

But I felt like you did.

Well, I didn't.

Maddy, Maddy, hey, hey.

I did exactly
what I knew I had to do

and it worked.

Hmm?

[Rex chuckling]

Rex, thank you for what you did.

I know it doesn't seem like it,
but I'm truly, truly grateful.

My family is, too.

You did save my life.

I just...

Uh, I don't know how
to say this, 'cause it's awful.

Just say it.

Deal with the emotion later.

I don't wanna see you.

I mean, I...

I don't want a life
that includes coming to prison

to visit the man
who saved my life

out of guilt
for half a decade.

I know how bad that sounds,

but that would be
the only reason.

I'm sorry.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


What is that?

Finland?

[cell mate] Can't run away
from your problems, my friend.

They always find a way
to catch up with you.

Especially heart break.

Can't outrun heart break.


[cell mate]
Rookie mistake.

what would you know about it?

[cell mate] More than you
think, but you do you, amigo.

You do you.

Just tryin'
to extend a helpin' hand.

How is that possible?


[cell mate] Yeah, I suppose you
uh, don't believe in fate, do you?

That remains to be seen.



Come here.



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Okay, okay, okay.

[taking deep breaths]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[taking deep breaths]

Rex, now or never.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Rex's conscience]
Let's do it.

Kill 'em all,
get her out of here.

She's not my concern.

[Rex's conscience]
What are you talkin' about?

She practically begged you
to murder her family

and take her away from here.

Again, she is not my concern.

My concern is getting back
to the life I had.

Getting the fuck out
of this place

and getting back to my friends
in the good old US of A

where we
don't fucking eat people.

Capisce?

So what are we doing then,
hmm?


We're leaving.

[taking deep breaths]

waiting for us up there.

You're not leaving without her.


my way to save some girl.

No girl.

Not this time.

[taking deep breaths]

[taking deep breaths]

How much time do we have?

Not enough.

yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.

[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Rex's conscience]
She's scared.

She isn't like them.

[Rex's conscience] She isn't
Maddy, it's not the same.

Maddy never wanted you.

Maddy never needed you.

This girl though, she...

She does need you, Rex.

She's been needing you
her whole life.

[taking deep breaths]

[Rex's conscience]
Don't turn your back on her.

[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Rex's conscience]
And if I didn't know any better

I'd say you need her
as much as she needs you.

Yeah, you forget, buddy.

I live in your head.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

New man out.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



Oh!


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[yelling in Finnish]



[lyrics in Finnish]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey.



[yelling in Finnish]


[yelling in Finnish]



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


I guess you don't watch the news
that much, huh?


[taking deep breaths]

[yelling in Finnish]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



[taking deep breaths]

We just killed
your entire family.

How do you feel about that?

[taking deep breaths]

I have mixed emotions.

It's fair.

It's emotions, by the way.


[taking deep breaths]

What was that?

Pati.

Pati.

[taking deep breaths]

[Pati growling]

That's your brother.

Mm-mm.


I thought you said
he never grew up.

I meant mentally.

Would have been nice to know,
Alia.

Sorry.


[Pati growling]

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

[speaking in Finnish]

Pati, Pati.

Pati, Pati.


Pati, Pati.




Pati.

Pati.


She started it.

[speaking in Finnish]



Don't, don't.



Pati, Pati.



[speaking in Finnish]


Pati.

Pati.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Pati!

[speaking in Finnish]


Pati!

[speaking in Finnish]



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Do you want it?

Do you want it?

Eat it, Pati!



You sick, twisted fuck.

[taking deep breaths]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Any more giant siblings
I should know about, Alia?

No, no.

We're safe now.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Rex's conscience]
That was a good last line.

"Eat it, Pati!"

That's from Misery, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, it was good, it was good.

You know, what would have been
better, though?

It's if you said something
along the lines of uh,

"You're finished", you know?

Or something like,
"Finish your vegetables.

Uh."

You know what I mean?

Because they're...

You know, anything
with finish in it really,

because they are Finnish.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So when we get there,

what do you wanna do
with you little brother?

Kill him?

[Alia chuckling]

No!

We're taking him with us.

Oh, okay.

Okay.


So how did you two meet?

Uh, well,

I was on vacation in Finland.

And uh,
and her parents hated me.


Uh, like biblically hated me.


Alright, anyway, it turns out,
she had four brothers.

You know,
each was a little quirky

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So I killed her entire family

and we've been a couple
ever since.

[indistinct Chatter]

What?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]
