[WATER DRIPPING]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

You can't save anybody,

until you save yourself.

[PHONE RINGING]

Narcotics.

You okay, baby?

You have a bad dream,
brother?

DANTE: You spoke to Stella?

FRANCIS: Mama J.
She's in London.

But I'm saying,
when is she coming back?

I don't know.
She's in London,

keeping it real
with her kid.

She's over there
with her kid
and her man

smoking blunts.

She got her kid
smoking blunts?

No. But he gets
that second-hand
thrill, you know.

So he's a happy kid. Yeah.

How old's he now?One.

Okay, fellas,
I think I'll be off now.

All right, Lucas,
that's for you.

All right then.

You guys take it easy.

Take it easy, Lucas. FRANCIS: All right, Luc.

Oh, listen.

I heard you're expecting
a large something
coming in sometime soon.

Is that true?

No. That's not true.

Huh.

Okay. See you later.

You don't trust him?

I known him too long
to trust him.

You know what I mean?

[KEYPAD BEEPING]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Hey, Dante.

What's up, baby?How you doin', hon?

Good.
How you doin'?Good.

Yeah?

You good?

What're you doin'? Um...

What's going on
at the spot?

What do you mean,
"What's going on?"

Where's Francis?

He's in the bathroom.
What's the problem?

I was just down
at the spot.

And?

I was looking around and
where's... Where's Pep?

What, he wasn't there?

No. Nobody was.

What do you mean,
"Nobody?"

It's 1:00 a.m.
in the morning.
The place is packed.

Where's our people?
Where's our crew?

[DOOR OPENING]

Hey, Micky.
How you doin'? Hi, Francis.

What do you hear?
What do you say?

I was... I was
just at the club

and, um, I think that
we're having a little bit
of a problem with Pep.

What kind of
problem, sweetie?

Pep should be there, right?

Yeah. He wasn't there?

None of his people
were there? Nope.

What do you wanna
do about this, D?

I don't know.
This kid needs like
a personal babysitter.

It's...Yeah, you're
looking at him.

I chased this kid
all over town.

Believe me.

You know what,
he's got to go.
He's got to go.

All right, fuck him.
I'll watch the spot myself.

It's not a big deal.

I mean, I keep hearing
he's ripping us off
and it's enough.

He's not ripping us off.
I mean, he's...

He's fucking up,

but he's not
ripping us off.
That's impossible.

Mmm-mmm. It's not
impossible, Cisco.

This kid's
doing something
behind our back.

FRANCIS: You think so? Yeah.

You think he's
stealing from us, too?

DANTE: He's doing something.

If he is, that's...deep.

You know, they think
you're not paying attention,
I guess. You know.

FRANCIS: Yeah, I know. And one thing leads
to another and then...

Bang. Yeah, you're right. DANTE: Right.

DANTE: Okay?

Yeah. I'll...
I know what to do.

PEP:  I was looking
all over the place
for you guys.

I ran out of dope
at 2:00. I was dry.

Yo, 30 decks ain't
gonna last me all night.

Thirty decks ain't gonna
last me till midnight.

If you guys
want me to work,

you're gonna have to
front me more than 30.

I got six kids
working the spot
right now.

That's how busy it is.

These two right here,
they go through a deck
in about half an hour.

I'm handing out
fucking packets
like it's candy.

It's a fucking
mob scene out there.

So if we're gonna work,
you guys are gonna have to
front me more than that.

You guys are gonna
have to front me
at least twice that.

Hell, three times that.

That's how fucking
busy it is.

We'll hook you up with
something a little later.

Pep, don't worry about it.

All right.

And don't be late.

FRANCIS: Huh.All right?

It's a big weekend.
We got a lot of
students coming.

DANTE: We're gonna
take care of everything.

FRANCIS: You're doing good.

I'm trying.

How you doin',
Young Flaco?

I'm all right. Uh-huh.

So, Pep's got you
working, huh?

Going through
clips like they
were candies, huh?

Yeah, pretty much, man.

Let me see what you got.

That's what
he gives you?

Yeah, that's what
he gives me. This is bullshit.

Who's stepping on it?

Nobody's stepping on it.

Look, I know you think
he's ripping you off,
but he ain't.

"He ain't?"

Use proper English.
He is.

He is ripping us off.

Taste it. Taste it.


What does it taste like?

It tastes like smack.

It tastes like
death, Flaco.

Like death.

PEP:  Heroin's heroin, Flaco.

Ain't nothing
right about it.

Everything's wrong.

These kids right here,
they're too young to know.

But all they're doing
is buying the hype.

Whatever.

Whatever happens to you,
I got your back.

I know you do, Flaco.

Just be careful, man.

I know you do.

WILL: Pep's fucking up.

Yeah. That's
what Cisco said.

Then he's a damn fool.

You know, sooner or later,
these kids are gonna
elsewhere for this shit.

You know,
if you want my opinion,

shit, I don't blame him.

Uh, see, but I don't
want your opinion.

Dante's got enough money.

Oh, right.
So, it makes it okay
to rip the man off?

Damn, boy,
you fucked up.

[DOG BARKING]

Hey, mommy.

Hey, baby.

Your hair's shorter.

You're skinnier.

You like it?

I don't know, yet.

What happened
to your eye? Unhappy customer.

You're kidding?Well, you know,
it's the weekend crowd.

What happened?

Well, she wanted Stoli
and I gave her Beefeater's.

So, she hit you? Wouldn't you?

She hit you
over a drink?

Nah. Her girlfriend did.

Oh, you're getting friendly
with the customers?

Hey, the only thing
I mix is drinks.

Right. You got every girl
in town fighting over you.

Yeah, but I'm worth it.

Great. Thanks.

Let me ask you
something, Micky.

Did you have any
trouble out at
one of your spots?

Yeah, yeah.

We had a problem
with one of the kids.

Yeah. It got
out of hand.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

Did you see him?

No, I was
around the corner.

When I got there,
there he was.

He was dead?

Yeah.

I don't understand
how it's even
gotten to this point.

Gotten to what point?

The point that
a kid's dead.

Baby, you know
what this is?

Yeah.

A kid's dead.
That gonna sleep
okay with you?

It's gonna have to, right?

So, you're gonna
sleep okay?

I'm gonna sleep okay.

You recognize this face?

Do you recognize
this face?


[LIGHTING MATCH]

We haven't talked
about your letters.

What do you wanna say?

Handwriting was
a little rough sometimes.

Somebody had to get
through to you.

You were just
killing yourself.

I know.

You were blind.

I was.

Now, you can see.

I can.

I have a bit
of news for you.

You should find it
quite interesting.

And old friend of yours
is back in town.

This face familiar?

COP: Do you
recognize this face?

Hey! Do you
recognize this face?What?

Is this a face
you recognize? No.

You have a choice...

You know?

I don't have a choice. You have a choice.

That's bullshit!

This could be the guy
that lets you walk.

Then I don't walk.

GEORGE:  You think he still
bears a grudge against you?

DANTE: Anybody would, right?

Maybe, he's learned to
accept what happened.

You can do your time
and you can move on.

I'm not gonna be here
for very long.

Mmm.

And I have
to use the time...

To carry my message.

I've been dead
for too long.

Mmm. You died
and came back.

Somebody's gotta
show them...

What's going on.

Mmm.

You can.

I had to die a little...

To figure that shit out.

Mmm. A little death
is where life starts.

Where you been?

Away.

What happened?

I died.

Went to heaven. [SCOFFS]

How was it?

They kicked me out.

This still Dante's spot?

You need to talk
to him about that.

Oh, really?

Let me ask you
a question.

Shoot.

You happy?

You owe me.

You got a good game.
You got a good spot.

You owe me.

What do I owe you?

Everything, papa.

That was
a long time ago.

Not that long ago.

Nothing changes.

Everything changes.

Not between us.

We got a bond.

OFFICER: Hey, look
what we got here, guys.

It's a fucking
candy store!

I think we can get
over each other.
Don't you?

There's something
you wanna say?Yeah.

You, um...

Go ahead, man.

You remember
that kid, Pep?

Yeah.
How's he doin'?

Wanna go see him?

[FLIES BUZZING]

GABRIEL: Ew!

Yeah.

He did this?

Yeah.

All right.
Look, don't worry.
All right, man?

It's gonna
be all right.
Seriously.

Come on.

Come on. Let's go.

Shit. That's
fucked up, man.

He was a good kid.

What're you doing? Just thinking.

What are you
thinking about?

Mmm.

You know how much
I love you, don't you?

Yeah, I do.

Yeah? Yeah.

Do I show it enough?

Of course you do, baby.

Do I show it enough?

Yeah.

We're okay, right?

We're better than okay.

DANTE:  We've been trying 
to have a kid, you know.

Yeah, Micky
was telling me.

It's not going
as good as it should.

Taking us a long time
for her to get pregnant.

How long have
you been trying?

Eight months.

Eight months!

That's a lot of
fucking, brother.

Yeah, it is.

Does it get boring?

It's strange.

I had a dream
about Pep last night.

I didn't like it, man.

I've been thinking
about that, too.

[FLIES BUZZING]

Are you all right?

Yeah, I think
I'm all right.

Who're you talking to? Nobody.

What are you doing? Nothing.

What're you doing?

What're you doing? I'm thinking.

What are you
thinking about?

Stuff.

What stuff?

How do you know...

That when
we have kids,

they're not gonna
wind up like Pep,
and Will Money

and the rest of them?

How do we know
that no matter
what we do,

our baby's not gonna
wind up hurting
somebody else's baby?

Or getting hurt?



Wake up!

Hey, kid!

Hey!

Kid, what are
you doing?

Come on.
Out of the car.

You hear me
talking to you?

I said,
"Get out of the car."

Hey!
Hey, calm down.

I'm not gonna
hurt you.

Just get out
of the car.

Now, come on.
Let's go.

Hey!

Now, calm down or
you're gonna get hurt.

Put up a fight, though.
Scrappy little booger.

He's deaf, apparently,
or just real good
at being stubborn.

We got anyone
who can sign?

You stole a car and drove it
all the way from Boston.

Why?

How long did it
take for you
to drive down?

Eighteen hours?

How can we
contact your family?

Well, what's the
problem at the home?

Anybody else besides
his mother and him?

No, just him and my mom.

And this produces
some friction?

Yeah.
There's some problems.

Between who?
Him or her?

Her.

Your mom?

Yeah, she has a
substance abuse problem.

Well, we've contacted the
youth services in Boston

and they consider
him a fugitive

because he left
the group home.

What does that mean?

That he has to
go back to Boston.

Now, there's no warrant
out at this stage

but if we turn him
over to you,

it's gonna be
your responsibility
if he doesn't return.

So, I just want to
make you aware of this

before we turn him
over to you.

Mmm.

I'll get him back. Okay.

So, what are
we gonna do?

[INDISTINCT CHATTER
OVER PHONE]

Mom, do you understand
that he escaped?

Do you understand
that he escaped, Mom?

Oh, so it's just
up to him, huh?

That's it?

What're you talking about,
that he won't talk to you?

No, that's because
you treat him
like an idiot.

You treat him
like an idiot.

Oh, you do not.

You did not.
You never learned
how to sign.

Quit the fucking shit!
You never did!

No, it's not.
No, it's not.

It's because you can't
deal with the fact that
you have a deaf kid.

That's your
fucking problem!

You got a fucking fugitive!
You understand that?

Do you understand
that he jumped a fence?

He escaped?

Oh, oh, oh, is it?
Oh, that's right! Okay.

Right. Okay. Well,
I'll just tell him
it's up to him then.

And, uh, you...
You're... Terrific!
You're great!

You're great, Mom. MOM:  Now, don't you
hang up on me!

[HANGS UP PHONE]

She's just
doesn't fucking...

She's just doesn't
fucking care.

That's her fucking...[PHONE RINGING]

God damn, man.
She's so fucked up!
She's so fucked up!

Can you read my lips?

You can?

Did you get
enough to eat?

Is your mom
doing drugs anymore?

A lot?

She's doing crack?

Your sister gets
mad at your mom.

Do you think she should
get mad at your mom?

Is your mom sick?

Is she gonna die?

GEORGE:  Conscience
bothering you again?

You're never gonna find
what you're looking for,

if what you're looking for
is an easy way out.

Oh, look who it is.

The mystery stranger,
we've all heard
so much about.

Gunther, look who's here.

Hello, Gabriel.

I was beginning to
worry about you.

Thought maybe you'd
forgotten about me.

Forgot about you?

Never.

You're the man.

Am I?

That's sweet.

You're asking for
a lot, Gabriel.

I'm not asking
for anything.

I'm offering to help you.

I can help you.

Help me. How?

Help you by
saving Dante.

Save yourself.

I am saved.

He's not doing
the right thing.

He's making mistakes.

That costs you.

Collaborating with weak,
misguided people,
that costs me.

Dante runs his affairs
like a gentleman.

And as a result,
his trade is thriving.

As long as the money flows,
everyone's happy.

No.

You're wrong.

He's losing his trade.

He's losing control.

I see it.

His crews are
in rebellion.

Money is easy.

Philosophy is hard.

What's your
philosophy here?

That everybody gets
what they deserve.

FRANCIS:  What's the
story with this guy?

Who is he?

He used to run
with us, back home.

What happened? He fucked up.

How? By fucking up.

DANTE:  The Kid
fucked up big time.

This is like when we 
were going through three, 
four hundred vials a day.

Things had to be 
tight, you know.

MICKY:  Yeah, everybody
had something going on.

Everybody had
money, a crew.

We were tight,
we were family.

But, he used too much
of the product.

How old are you? Eighteen.

Eighteen, my ass.

MICKY:  Partied too much, 
fucked up too much.

You'd better be 18,
or you'll get me some
Okeechobee jail and shit.

I'm saying?

Got robbed all the time.

What the fuck is this?

What the fuck
is this bullshit?

MICKY:  Got set up
by the girls he was
chasing around with.

Oh, man.

Give me your phone,
give me your phone.

And get me a cigarette,
all right?

This is a minor
fucking setback,
it's a minor setback.

It was after that
that he got arrested.

How did that happen?

By fucking up
one too many times.

OFFICER: How are you
guys doing in there?

Good. How you
doing tonight?

Good. You know your
red taillight is out?

No. I didn't know that. Yeah.

Youse looks like youse
are feeling pretty good.

I'm feeling good.
How are you feeling?

Good. And where
are youse going?

We're going to
that nightclub down...

You're going to
the nightclub? Yeah?Uh-huh.

You're welcome to
join us, if you want.

I need you to turn off
your car for me.

For what? 'Cause I told you to.

Damn, shit.

I also need you to
step out of the car.

Step out of the car.

I'm not going to
tell you again,
step out of the car.

'Cause of my light... Let's go.

Get out of the car. All right.

Boy, you really
are feeling good,
aren't you?

Get on the car. Damn.

Don't fucking move. All right.

Don't move. My dance card
is full, Officer.

Hey, look what
we got here guys.

It's a fucking candy store.

Hey, we got
Jesse James now.

You're in
big trouble, pal.

I don't know
shit about that.

Shut the fuck up.
Nobody knows nothin'.

Could I get a light,
please?

Shut up, I told you.Yo, what...

You got a question?

No.

Sounds like
homeboy fucked up.

[SALSA MUSIC PLAYING]

What's up, man?

So, what do you think?

I can do that, man.

Just remember,
it's not about me.

This is about Pep.

This is for love.

Go fuck yourself man.

All right.

If you changed your mind,
you changed your mind.

MICKY: Dante. Dante.

Someone spiked our bags.

The kids were out
selling bad dope all night.

Six people OD'd.

They died, baby.

And the spot's
been shut down.

You want to
get out of what?

We need to work
something out.

Work what out, exactly?

I don't want
the spot anymore.

That's it.

That's pretty convenient
timing on your part.
Don't you think?

There's nothing
convenient about it.

Considering what happened.
We've been shut down.

You think, maybe
I did this myself.

I set the
whole thing up.

It occurred to me.

I'm the one being
pressured, D'Avalon.

No one's pressuring
you, Dante.

You're stepping aside. I'm being pressured.

I started this
when I was a kid,
I'm not a kid anymore.

You're a man now.

I'm trying.

You can't get off the
hook that easy, Dante.

You just can't.

It wasn't me.

It was Flaco.

FRANCIS: Yo, Flaco.

Cisco, man.
What's up? What's up?

Nothing, man. What are you
doing, man?

Nothing.

What are you doing?

I'm doing nothing, man.You're fucking up, man.

What are you talking about?I said, you're
fucking up man.

We got to go
for a ride, okay.

I'll drive.Where are you
taking me, man?

Where you driving, man? Get in.

[CAR APPROACHING]

What's up, D?
What's going on? Hey, yo.

What's going on, man?Yo, man.

You're selling this?Yeah, man.

How much you
asking for it?

I don't know.
Like five or six.

Let me see the keys.

What are you
going to do, man?

I want to take it
for a test drive.

How much you
asking for it?

Uh, five sounds cool, man.

What about nothing?
That sound cool?

When you get
tired of walking,

you come to
see me, stupid.

Hey man,
he coming back, man?

My heart goes
out to you, brother.

I don't fucking know
what to tell you.

[ENGINE STARTING] That's my
fuckin' car, man.

He took my car.

Come on, man...

Jesus, fuck.

FLACO:  What was
I supposed to do?

How was I supposed
to know that guy

was gonna hang 
bad dope on me?

'Cause you figure,
you know,

he's coming back with
something on his mind.

He's out to get his.

So, he hooks up with Lucas.

Goes through Lucas,
to get back to me.

I felt like I needed to
get back at you for Pep.

I had much love for Pep.

After a while,
it wasn't about Pep.

It was about something
else altogether.

It was about you.

This guy could be the guy
that lets you walk.

Then I don't walk.

We're talking about,
some time here.

You willing to do that?

I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

[PINS CLATTERING]

Yo, how long are we
supposed to wait in here?

I don't know, man.

[DOOR OPENING]

You know what
that means, right? Hell yeah.

I ain't stupid,
motherfucker.

It's your fault
we in this
in the first place,

opening your big mouth.

"I got to get it
off my chest."

What kind of
punk ass shit is that?

I did what
I had to do, man.

You see 'em?

Lilly this is Lucas.

You know Lilly, right? Hi, Lilly.

They look cute
back there, don't they?

They told him
I was involved.

They might have. That wasn't
part of the deal.

How did they find out?

There are no
secrets, Luc.

What's the matter?

You got what you wanted.

You got what you wanted.

You think you
can push him
out of the nest?

You have to
do it with me.

I did it already.


Is that your gun?

Yeah.

Let me see.

Is it loaded?

Whoa! [LAUGHS]

So, it's loaded?

[GUN CLICKS]


Guy's a bad
influence on you.

It's good.

Hey.

How you doing?
Got your message.

We need to talk.

Yeah. I know.

GABRIEL:  So, I guess 
you told him everything.

Yeah. Sure.

I have nothing to hide
from him or from you.

What else do
you wanna know?

I've heard enough.

I've never had any doubts
about anything I've done,
you know.

No guilt.

No remorse.

No guilty conscience.

And this makes you proud?

It makes me honest.

Honesty...

I suppose you still
want your take.

Yeah, I want
what's mine.

Oh, you'll get
what's coming to you.

Everybody does.


What is this,
some kind of joke?

It's serious.
We bring you home.

Have to.

Have to.

What's up, man?

What's up?

I'm late, man.

It's okay, buddy.

So, he gave you
back your car?

He said I could
go back to him,
if I wanted to.

Is that what you want?

I don't know
what I want, man.

If you don't know, then...

You're lost.


D'AVALON:  Why 
all the violence?

They're just children.
They're not easy to control.

You can't take matters
into your own hands,
Gabriel.

You just can't.

It's not that easy.

You don't wanna end up
like Lucas, do you?

He dug himself
a deep hole

he had no choice
but to climb into.

You're about halfway there.

I'm not digging a hole.

I'm building a house,

that we can all live in.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

It's my brother.

Is he here?

How's it going,
little man? It's all right.

You get that kid? Nah.

What's the matter?

I don't know.
Kid's hiding. I guess.

Where'd you look
for him, at school?

Yeah.

Went by his house? Mmm-hmm.

It's all right,
Li'l Half Dead.

Come here.

I was gonna
eat this, but...

You want it? Thanks.

[BOTTLE CLATTERING]

Will Money.

What's up, partner?

What's up?

Who told you
I was down here.

You fucked up, Will.

Gabriel, man.

He's got a nasty crew
working for him.

These evil motherfucker's.

You decided to
play with fire.

Nobody told me
it was going to
turn out like this.

I didn't know.

I just want to go home.

I want to see my mom,
I want to see my dog.

I don't want to
do this anymore.


All right, Will.

You stay out.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

THUG 1: Rise and shine, baby. THUG 2: Come on, wakey-poo.

Wakey-poo.
Come on, wake up baby. THUG 1: Rise and shine baby.

Hey, what's up, man?

Rise and shine, man.

Hey, sleepy head, get up.

What's up?

It's your birthday,
man. Get up. Happy birthday.

It ain't my birthday.

Sure it is, man.
Look at this party,
we got here for you.

It's your party man, come on. All these people are here
for you, man. Come on.

THUG 3: It's a damn
party out here.

I got a present
for you, man.

Today's the first day
of the rest of your life.


[ALL CHEERING]

You really want
to find him?

I really want to find him.

So you can do what?

Shoot him.

D'AVALON: Listen to me, Dante.

You're not alone, here.

Everyone makes mistakes.

Everyone does things
that they're not proud of.

But that's the part of you
you have to recognize
and embrace.

That's how you 
transcend your weakness.

That's where
you find strength.

Oh!

Fuck! Fuck!

[TIRES SCREECHING]



Ugh!

Ow!




Nice.

Oh, look, a gun.

Don't.

Here.

It's the key to your car.

Yeah.


You remember now, right?

[INDISTINCT CHATTER
OVER RADIO]

You're in big trouble.
Look at this shit.

You're killing babies
on the street
with this dope.

Good, 'cause it
ain't my shit.

Good stuff, pal,
you got here?

OFFICER: Big trouble, pal.

You're going away for
a long time. Goodbye.

I'm going to the
Waffle House
in five minutes.

Shut up.

What happened? I don't know.

It's not my shit.Oh, none of its yours?

Jesus Christ.

We've got a bevy
of goods here.

Oh, kid,
you fucked up.

Did he fuck up? He fucked up.

Bang, bang.
A real cowboy.


He fucked...


Dante. What?

I'm pregnant.

Ow! Shit.

Are you okay? Ow! Fuck.

Are you all right? Mmm-hmm.

Shit. Jesus.

Shit. Are you okay, baby?


How are you? I'm good.

Come here, baby. I'm here.

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

It's says here
that over 50% of
women experience

nausea to some degree.

"Sometimes intense." Mmm-hmm.

You can combat it
by eating yogurt.

I don't know how much
you like yogurt. I like yogurt.

"Bouts of exhaustion
and fatigue

"as your metabolic
rate slows.

"Headaches due to
poor circulation..."

Headaches!
"Varicose veins,

"ankle... Ankle..."

Your ankles swell up.
"Leg cramps." [CHUCKLES]

You get a whole
list of things.


This is what you got
to look forward to.
Terrible stuff.

I mean, it's beautiful, too,
at the same time.

Yo.

You think you can
do that thing
we talked about?

Yeah. I can do that.

So you're really doing this?

I'm doing it.

Those wedding bells
are breaking up
that old gang of mine.

No, man.

Nothing's breaking up, man.
You know that, right?

Yeah, I know.

You know what this is.

You were married, right?

I was.

You never talk about it.

It's one of things,
you know? I...

I met her,
we got together...

You know, it's like...

It's, like, "Wow.

"How the fuck
did that happen?"

You know, when you meet
somebody like that,
it's like you're just so...

That's when life is good.

You're so in love,
it hurts, you know?

Some people never
experience that. I'm lucky.

That's true.

Fucking 19 years old,
we flew to Vegas.

You guys got
married there?

Yeah. 'Cause I had
a lot of money
in those days.

It's back in the day. Right.

Just, you know,
fly to Las Vegas.
Why not, you know?

So we went.
It was great.
Just crazy.

Casinos,
and people and shit.

Eating and sleeping
and tripping.

You know? We did it.I hear you.

Just did it.

I never had
so much fun in my life

'cause it was like
so beautiful.

That's cool.
What happened?

We came back, you know,

there's a lot of clubs
we hit, and stuff.

[CLEARS THROAT]
But she met this guy,

they were, you know.

They were out one night...

And, uh, this
fucking guy had money.

He had a lot of...
He had his own plane.

And, uh,
he took her up in it.

Took her for a ride
in his plane to
impress her, you know.

She died.
You know, they crashed.

'Cause he was drunk.

So I dug up his grave.

I went and found out
where he's buried.

I dug up his grave,

I took him to a lot,
empty lot on 186th Street,

put him out there,
let the dog's feast
on him, you know?

Had to be done, you know?

I gotta piss.

NURSE: Excuse me, sir. ORDERLY: Hey, you
can't come in here.

Cisco! Excuse me.

Excuse me! Cisco!

I'm looking for my friend.Excuse me, sir.

He was here
a little while ago. You can't come back here.

You can't come in here.

You cannot be in here.

I'm sorry.
You can't be in here.

You can't be in here. Let me go.

Cisco!It'll be all right.

It'll be all right.

You can't be in here.

Come on. With us. Come on, come on.

Cis!

Can I have
Porterhouse steak

with um...


The shrimp,

the, the shrimp
side-order, please.

And um...

And I'd just like a...

If I could just
have it like...
I'm just...

The chicken salad.

The chicken um...

The chicken
Caesar salad, please.

I had a dream
that I sliced the ball

into the woods,
past the seventh hole,

where the thickets
are like barbed wire.

And I grabbed my Gary Player
and I went in after it

and I... Immediately
I became... Lost.

It was dark,
and then it got cold.

And it was like the woods
came to life around me.

At one point,
I came to this river

and for some reason,
I tried to swim across.

The water was
choppy and black.

I got pulled under until
my lungs were empty of air.

And that was it.

Most people don't like
to make their own mulch.

I find it relaxing.

Cocktail?

Just water, all right?

And no ice, okay.

So, are you all right?

Sure.

Ever had the chance
to sail the Caribbean?

Excuse me?

Really, have you?

No, I haven't
had that chance.

You should.

You really should
once in your life.

It's a little like dying
and going to heaven.

So...

Do you think we're going
to be able to reach

some kind of a compromise?


I have a feeling you've
been shooting smack.

Is this true?

You need to
stay away from drugs.

You do drugs like smack,

you're throwing away
your life.

You begin to live
for the drug.

You lose your own
sense of self-respect

and your life
begins to fall apart

and you make
errors in judgment.

This affects
people around you.

You don't only
hurt yourself,

but you wind up
hurting others.

If you don't stop,
you will die.



[LOVE SONG PLAYING]

DANTE:  You have 
to take him home.

He's not gonna want to go.

I understand.
But you have to
take him home, baby.

He's your brother.

He's gotta go. He's gotta go.

Tomorrow.

Okay.

Oh, he saw
the whole thing.

He understood?

Did he understand me? Of course he did.

[ENGINE STARTING]

What! Come...

WILL:  Got that love.

All clean works.

What's up?
How you want to feel?

How you want to feel?

What's up, partner?

How you want to feel?

[DOOR OPENING]

He's coming here
looking for you.


What's up?

Nothing.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

You can't save anybody

until you save yourself.

COP:  Do you
recognize this face?

Hey.

Do you recognize
this face? What?

Is this a face
you recognize?

No.

This guy could be the guy
that lets you walk.

You guys ready, huh?

You know what
you want to do?

Yeah, I know.

We're not gonna go to jail.
He's not going to jail.

You want a name,
I'll give you a name.

I want a name.
Is it him?

Mmm-hmm. That's him.

Okay. Here's how we do it.

We know how to do it.

Let's just go. Let's just
cut this fucking crap.

You know how to
set him up?

Yes.

I'll see you. Okay?All right.

What's up? What's going on?

Nothing.
You seriously going to
let me get this, right?

Yeah. Don't come back
too late, though.

Here go
the keys. Cool.

No. Not late at all, man. 
But, I gotta cut loose.

Why did you
do that to me?

We did it for us.

You find what
you're looking for?

Oh, fuck.
