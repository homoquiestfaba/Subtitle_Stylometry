<i>Episode 5: The Eye</i>

Anna!

Anna!

Somebody help me!

Let me-
Help me!

Anna!

Please help me!

Ruber, what the hell
did you do to me?

How you feeling, kiddo?

We're getting close, son.

Car's ready, sir.

Hey.

Did you sleep?

No.

I just can't
come up with anything.

Are you sure these pictures
don't mean anything to you?

No.

I mean, except that the Collectors keep
showing up agaln and agaln.

The pictures, the film,

but I can't make a connection.

I can't either.

I just hope they can help us find out
who the man in this room was.

We're in uncharted
territory here, Joe.

I mean, no one's ever
seen this guy before.

We don't know that he
actually existed.

Jennifer, he was standing right there.
We both saw him.

And if the prime object
is a person,

it makes sense that he'd be
able to bring my daughter back.

I've gotta find him.
That's all I care about right now.

Right.

What are you gonna do?

I'm gonna take another
look at the film.

The Collectors
disturbed reallty somehow.

I'm gonna try
and figure it out.

What?

Kreutzfeld sent you after those Polaroids,
didn't he?

He didn't send me.

We're working together.

What makes you think you
can trust him so much?

Good morning, sir.

Right this way.

Please.

Welcome to the Sood.

Mr. Kreutzfeld,
my good friend.

At last, we meet in person.

You're early.

Never early for
business, is it, Sood?

No, no.
Never, never.

You go everywhere together?

Oh, yeah.
Afrald so.

Not by choice.
I prefer my own life.

I was once normal.

It's overrated.

Sit, please.

First edition,
rough around the edges.

I'd call it "falr" condition.

A little less falr now.

Just checking
it's not an object.

No, no, no.
Never objects in my shop, only signs.

Pictures of objects.

Videos, artifacts,

no objects for sale.

That's dangerous business.

Tell me more.

It belonged to John Clark,
one of the Collectors,

born 1938, died-

1971.

In the First Cabal war.

How do you know it's Clarks?

I just bought it
off his nephew.

Had a bunch of stuff
in a trunk,

no idea what it was.

I called you first, of course.

I know you have a taste for
Collector's artifacts.

Thank you for coming
to me with this.

I'll, of course, pay
whatever it is you're asking,

whatever price
you think is falr,

and I shall accept your word
that it's genuine.

But if at some point I should
find out that it's fake,

that you tried
to con me in any way,

or that I hear you've made copies
and someone else has one,

then I'll have to come back here
and hurt you.

Mr. Kreutzfeld, my friend,

I am the Sood.

I deal in signs, no fakes.

No forgeries, no duplicates.

I stake my life on it.

No, no, no, I don't have anything
to do with that.

Mick, what's going on
out there?

Is that a way out?
Yes.

This way.

You need to tread
very carefully now.

You need to tell me
what's going on.

I've told you
everything I know.

I've been stralght
with you from the beginning.

Then what's this?

That's the combination
to the Collector's vault,

wherever it is.

It's what we've both
been looking for.

In the vault, I believe,
is the glass eye

which has the power to
destroy or repalr all flesh.

Could be used as a weapon,
most definitely,

but it could also cure
my son's leukemia.

Can I be any more clear,
detective?

What about the man?

What man?

The man in the motel room.
Who was he?

You're speaking of
the Occupant theory.

People far more obsessed than you
have gone down that road.

Who did the objects
belong to?

There has to be
an Occupant, right?

I say no.
There's no Occupant.

I've seen him.

I took the Polaroid
to the original motel.

I went inside the motel room and I saw it
just like it was back in 1961,

and there was
a man in the room.

My God.

You really
didn't know, did you?

That certalnly explalns something
I've never really understood.

Most of the time
in the evidence I found...

the Collectors refer to
their hiding place as a vault,

but in two instances,
they call it a tomb.

You think he's dead?

Nobody has seen him.
Nobody knows who he is.

Trust me,
I've done the research.

But if there is a body,
and the Collectors hid it somewhere,

it might be in the vault.

I got this from
Conroy's husband.

He is the last
living Collector.

I had it digitized.

Unbelievable.

The Collectors were trying
to do an experiment in Room 9.

Look, they nalled objects
to the door.

This is huge.

It gets weirder.

Wh... what's happening now?

I think this is
where the world almost ends.

The original film was stolen.

Someone is a step
ahead of us on this.

I'll kick this up the ladder,
get the Legion moving on it.

Your Lieutenant back in Pittsburgh
has been calling.

Wants to know how the hell
we let Joe Miller escape.

I don't know.

There is no hallucinogens
in your system.

You're clean.

No, Martin Ruber
did something to me.

I think you
should go back home,

as soon as the doctors
release you, detective.

Not until I find Martin Ruber.

I'm probably going
to die of dehydration.

I just thought I'd mention.

No!

No! No!

No, no...

No, no!

No! No!

I've been promoted,
by the pontifex himself,

so your cell will report directly to me
from now on.

Congratulations, Parchman.

Thanks.

Should have been you,

but you let Ruber steal two objects
right out from under you.

You know what the punishment
is for that?

I'll get the objects back.

And I'll take care of Ruber.

Good.

It would be a shame
to lose you.

Key, clock, scissors.

We want into the vault,
we need all three.

Between us, of course,
we have the key and the clock.

It's the scissors.

I think I know someone
who could help us find them.

The word is you vanished,
Mr. Kreutzfeld.

The Sood has security video
and everything.

Yeah, I had a little
lapse in security.

He's trying
to sell the DVD now.

So what are you guys
looking for?

Scissors.

Your pitching slow balls.

$10,000.
Cash.

$5,000.

Okay, 10.
12.

I think you've tried my
patience enough for one day.

Zoralda Figueroa,
Washington, D.C.

She deals crystal meth or
pop tarts or something.

Is she dangerous?

Scissors are rarely
sought after,

but she's had them
for three years,

so she must be doing
something right.

And what do
the scissors do exactly?

They rotate things.

So what do you do,
spin plates with it?

Dude, if you want to theorize,
I'm gonna charge you another grand.

So Zoralda's apartment
is up on the fourth floor,

and if she still
has the scissors,

we should just be able,
to buy them off her.

This is a terrific neighborhood.

Is there a reason we couldn't just
come here through the motel room?

It's just- It's not that easy.
I never been here before.

Besides, I like to see
what I'm getting into first.

Maybe we should surprise her.

Oh, yeah. Wouldn't want her
to rotate us till we're dizzy.

This her apartment?

Stay behind me.

If you insist.

Zoralda, I'm-

You want something
from me, huh?

You want some, too?

Oh, rotates.

Calm down.
Adios.

You picked the wrong girI
to mess with.

Having a hard time breathing?

I'll take these.

Please...

Don't take my scissors.

I'm sorry.

It's all I have left.

Get up.
Get up.

Get-

Who the hell is that?

And that, I believe, is the combination
to the vault.

If only we knew
where the vault was.

What is this?

I don't know.
The sun?

No, I've seen this before.

I'll be right back.

Barbara Stritzke had these.

The location of
the Collectors vault

is hidden somehow
inside those pictures.

I'm sure of it.

They certalnly makes
no sense to me.

Well, it didn't make
sense to me at first, either,

but together
they make up a map.

A map.

Well, a map or instructions.

It makes sense
if you've used the key.

When you leave the room,

you have to picture
a door in your mind,

If you don't, it'll just
pick a door for you at random.

If you want a specific door,
you have to have been there.

You have to be able to fix
an image of it in your mind.

I think that's what these
pictures are for:

to take you to the vault
without ever having been there before.

And where is there exactly?

Okay.

What do these
look like to you?

They look like lines.

Maybe out of focus.

These are bars.

That's a guard tower,
you see that?

I can't believe
I didn't see this before.

This is a prison.

We find the prison,
we find the vault.

Hey.
Hi.

What's wrong?

Why do you want this?

Why do you need the Legions files
on the Collectors?

I'm trying to find a way
into the vault with Kreutzfeld.

Oh, God.

I'm sorry you don't like this,
but this is the best chance I've got.

You forget, Joe,
I used to know Kreutzfeld.

I liked him, too,

but something
happened to him.

He changed.

I trust him.

He's gonna kill you as soon
as he is done with you.

You're putting the rest
of us in danger.

I am just trying
to find my little girI.

I can't worry about the whole damn world.
I'm not you.

You don't think
I wake up every morning,

wanting my old life back?

You don't get to choose, Joe.

No, I don't.

I'm not ready to come back
to Pittsburgh yet.

I need some time off.

I'm searching for something.

Ow.

What?
What's the matter?

Wally, you can't send
teenage girls to hell.

Are you kidding me?
Teenage girls deserve it the most.

Look.

I could have bowled a 260 if those girls
weren't teasing me.

I can't bowI with people watching.
It makes me tense.

Seriously, I could go pro
if no one was watching.

That's great, Wally.
Listen to me.

I think I found a way
into the Collector's vault.

What, you don't think
I can go pro?

Wally-
You should see my release.

Wally!

What do you think you're going to find
in the vault, Joe?

The Occupant and the eye.

Okay, there's no such
thing as the Occupant,

and even if there was,
he's long dead by now.

I've seen him.

And I'm going to find him.

Are you nuts?
Do not go in the vault, Joe.

Do you hear me?

The Collectors buried the objects there
for a reason.

Wally, I have to find him.

If the Occupant's body is in the vault,
I'm taking my chances.

What if he aln't dead, hmm?

What if he just sitting there
walting for you?

Hmm?

Why are you really here, Joe?

I need a favor.

It's ridiculous.

I mean, how do you hide 12 objects
for 40 years inside of a prison?

If we're lucky,
it's abandoned.

How about if it's torn down?

How about if it's
a golf course now?

This is definitely the door
they want us to use.

There is probably
no other way, in or out.

Karl...
Yeah?

What was the name of the Collector
who owned that book?

The book you got
from the Sood.

John Clark.
He was one the original Collectors.

John Clark...

Is there something there
in the Legion files?

Here he is.
John Clark.

John Clark was a guard at the State Prison
in Kellogg county from 1955 to 1963.

I think we've found our prison.

Oh, Karl,
you shouldn't have.

It's what I do.

I thought I'd make it
easier for us.

Your gonna have
to leave the flask.

Excuse me?

We're taking the clock,
the scissors, and the key,

and no other objects.

Okay.

You should leave the gun then.
Falr is falr.

Well, technically,
the gun is not an object.

Joe.

All right.

And in the interest
in complete disclosure,

I shall leave behind
the cufflink as well.

What the hell does that do?

Lowers blood pressure.

Might be a placebo,
but something is working.

All right.

You ready?
Yes.

Do you have it yet?

Just give me one more second.

I think I got it.

What are you walting for?

Wait!

Karl, hang on!

Hang on!

You got me?
I got you.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought you wanted
the inside of the prison.

All right, ready?
Come on up.

I guess I owe you one.

Forget it.
We're even.

Well, at least
it's abandoned.

Yeah, but it's still the wrong door.
I don't get it.

If I was a vault,
were would I be?

Well, it's doubtfuI
it's in here.

I just can't get
a lock on this door.

These pictures
just don't add up.

Come on.

Wait a minute.

It's in a fallout shelter.
It's underneath the prison.

Come on.

So is this it?

Looks like it.

It's not a real door.
What?

It's just palnted on.

Karl, no!

What does this
look like to you?

It's Conroy, isn't it?

No.

There is someone else
in that room.

It's him.

It's the Occupant.

The man I saw
in the Polaroid.

Damn it!
Open!

Why not use the key?

No lock.

Concrete.

Collectors.

What does
the clock do, exactly?

It doesn't happen to drill
through walls, does it?

It sublimates brass.

Sublimates?

Turns solids into
gas without liquefying.

Or vice versa.

Sort of like when
dry ice becomes steam.

And the scissors-

Rotate.

Yeah, I got that one.

There's a seam here.

Hand me the scissors.
Right.

Be careful with these, will ya?

Thank you.
Yeah. Nice work.

Do you hear that?
Yeah.

What the hell?

Good thing you had me
leave my gun behind.

Starting to have
second thoughts about that.

What do we got here?

Our fallout shelter.

Welded shut.

Let me guess:
with brass.

We should step back a little.

Why is that?

I don't want to breathe
metallic gas, do you?

I found what you wanted.

Here is the Legion's report of all the
objects and their known whereabouts.

I don't know how accurate that is,
but that's the closest thing we've got.

Great, thanks.

Oh, my God.
Look at this!

I don't get it.

These are
the Conroy objects.

The same objects
from the film.

Karl Kreutzfeld
has them all.

He trying to recreate
the Conroy experiment.

That doesn't
make any sense.

It's suicide.
He'll kill us all.

Not if we kill him first.

I hope the prime object's
in there.

So we both get
what we want out of this.

After I get my daughter back,
you can have the key.

I don't want it.

I couldn't have done
this without you.

Oh, my God.

We found it.

Joe, nobody's seen these
objects in over 40 years.

Oh, no.

No.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry, Joe.

Joe, my search is over.

Well, that's great for you, Karl,
but mine's not.

Oh, but it is.

I can bring your
daughter back now.

How?

How can you bring
Anna back?

The same way
I bring Isaac back.

Do you know what
the quarter does, Joe?

It brings life to memories
for a short time.

Two days, sometimes three.

Oh, my God.

My son Isaac.

He died nine years ago.

This is all I have left.

It was enough for a while.

Karl, what are you...

What are you saying?

You're still not seeing the objects
for what they really are.

They're tools...

tools to reshape reallty.

The properties
that we perceive,

they're side effects,
tip of the iceberg.

The objects allow us
to change reallty

on levels that our bralns
can't even understand.

Don't you see? Conroy opened up a door
through reallty itself

where anything is possible.

Listen to me.

I saw what Conroy did,

and she almost
ripped reallty apart.

But I can do it right this time.

I can bring my boy back.
I can bring him back to life.

We can both bring our children back.
Both of them!

No, Karl, this isn't
just about us.

What if you're wrong?
It will work!

And what if it doesn't?

Well, everyone will be dead,
and it won't really matter.

Well, I can't do that.

Yes...

You sald you were willing
to do whatever it took.

I am, but not this.

Then I'm going
to need the key, Joe.

No.

The quarter brings
living memories as well.

The key.

Sorry, Joe.

Kreutzfeld,
you son of a bitch.

Hey.

You're getting good at that.

Are you okay?

No.

Thanks for the loan, Wally.

My pleasure.

Uh, your lady friend is here.

You were right about Kreutzfeld.

I lost the key.
I lost everything.

I know what Kreutzfeld's
trying to do.

He's trying to recreate
the Conroy experiment.

His son is dead.

He wants to resurrect him,

and now he has
the glass eye.

I'm responsible for that.

Listen, Joe, I restored the film
and I saw exactly what happened.

Conroy didn't stop
the experiment.

The Occupant did.

The Occupant?

I am sorry, I don't know
how to do this,

but we have to stop
Kreutzfeld somehow.

Now.

Let me do that
with the Legion.

But if we fall,
the Occupant's our last hope.

You have to find him.

I don't know where to start.
I don't have the key.

I don't have anything.

Joe, you've come farther
than anyone else.

You'll find him.

We're ready, son.

All right, think. What do we know
about the Occupant?

Nothing.

The objects all belong to him,
so they're his personal possessions,

so there's got to be at least one
thing that identifies him or

tells us where he's from. - I didn't even
know there was an Occupant until yesterday.

How would I have any idea-
What are you- Don't touch it.

Wait a minute. Before it was an object,
this was just a bus ticket, right?

I need you to not do that.
Come on!

Hey, do you know how hard it is for me
to get that duct tape on there

without zapping myself here?

Whoa.
Look at that.

Bus route's right on there.

Whoa.
Willowbrook, Arizona.

That's where he came from.

That's a start, my friend.

Pull over here.
Right here.

What, right here?
Yep, right here.

Welcome to Willowbrook, home of
the Occupant, whoever he is.

Well, if I'm right,
he disappeared from here in 1961,

so I'm gonna check the missing
persons reports.

Where's the police station?

Wally, I'm wanted
for murder and kidnapping.

We can't walk into
a police station.

We're at the hall of records.

Sheriff, it's
Detective Bridgewater.

You're still in town?

Yeah, I have a question.

Detective Miller and Dr. Ruber escaped
in a prisoner transport van.

Did it ever turn up?

Yeah, abandoned
not too far from here.

Where?

Motel Sunshine just off old Route 66.
You know the place?

Yeah.

Novocaln.

Sir?

I need Novocaln
and a syringe.

I'll see to it, sir.

What, a man can't sing
to his bus ticket?

Well, there were no
missing persons in 1961,

but there was an extra person.

What's an extra person?

"Police arrested an unidentified man
yesterday-"

blah blah blah blah blah.

"The man accosted MabeI Smith, 24,
of Willowbrook,

"clalming to be her husband.

Miss Smith is unmarried."

Who's MabeI Smith?

She's the town librarian.

Help you boys?

Mabel Smith?
Mm-hmm.

I'm Joe Miller.

Can we sit down
and talk for a second?

Sure.

I found an old article
that mentions your name.

Why are you showing me this?

I'm looking for him.

I'm sorry, I can't help you.

Mabel, you filed a police
report agalnst this man.

You must remember something.

It's been so long.

He said he was my husband.

I never saw him before, but...

he knew all sorts of
things about me,

things no one knows.

What struck me at the time
was that he seemed so sure,

so insistent that
I believe him.

And you... did you
believe him?

Oh, no. No, no.

But he still haunts me.

You see, I never married...

and, uh...
he was as close as I came.

What was his name?

I don't, uh...

I don't remember.

Is there anything else
that you can remember?

Anything at all? I can't tell you
how important this is to me.

He gave this to me.

I've never shown anyone.

Now that's him
and that's me.

But that picture
was never taken.

I never saw him before
he showed up on my doorstep.

And this...

This is the part
that I can't sit with.

Yes, that's my handwriting.

I still wonder if I should
have said yes.

Yes, I remember.

Mabel, may I take this picture?

Yes, take it.

Thank you.

40 years old, good as new.

It's an object.

Well, Wally, I think I know why no one's
ever found the occupant.

Whatever the event was
that created the objects

ripped him out of
the world somehow,

just like the motel room.

His history's been erased.
No one remembers him.

This picture might be the only evidence
he ever even existed.

Yeah, right. A pencil gets plucked
out of existence,

nobody cares.

But a whole guy...

How do you find a man
who doesn't exist?

<i>Episode 6: The Prime Object</i>

Oh, my God.

It's real.

Bridgewater.

Lee, it's Sheriff Starnes.

Good news.
We just picked up your man, Dr. Ruber.

You wanted to know what he did to you.

Why don't you ask him?

He's at the hospital.

Sood's books.

Welcome to Loserville.

Every disgusting wannabe, coulda-been,

has-been object loser hangs out here.

It makes me sick
to see you here.

I need to find something
that I.D.s the Occupant.

Driver's license,
some personal item with his name on it.

The Sood's the guy to ask,
but he won't help you now.

You've pissed him off.

Well, I'll apologize to him,
smooth things over.

Yeah, that will work.

Come on.

I'm not coming with you anymore.

Those people, my bus ticket,
they're like piranhas.

This whole thing, you're getting in
so deep it's dangerous for me.

I'm sorry.
I just can't.

You know what, Wally?

You're right.

Thanks for everything.

I owe you.

Hey, Joe.

Get her back.

I'm here to see The Sood.

Appointment only.

Look, could you just tell The Sood
that I'd like to apologize?

Appointment only.

Can I make an appointment?

No!

Well, well.

Took me a while, Detective.

You're a difficult man to track down.

But every riddle has an answer.

I don't have it.

You'll excuse me
if I don't believe you.

Montague, ask yourself,

would I be walking to my next destination
if I had the key?

So what?

You're just another object loser?
Welcome to the club.

Is that really a gun in your pocket?

Yes.

Intimidating.

Do you know The Sood?

Do I know The Sood?

Of course I know The Sood.

He's a friend.
He's a colleague.

We have dinner.
Good.

Introduce me to him.

Sir.

Enter.

Weasel, how many times
have I got to tell you,

keep your stinking carcass
out of my shop.

You, too?

Pumeet.

Wait, wait.

Sood, listen, I just wanted to introduce
you to my friend-

you're already-

I know you guys got off
on the wrong foot, so...

Kill them.

Please, Sood.
Hear me out.

I want to apologize for the disturbance
I caused here a few days ago.

My argument was with Mr. Kreutzfeld,

and I had no right
bringing that argument here.

all I want is to find this man.

The Occupant.

There's a guy object?

I mean, there's an object that's a guy?

That changes everything.

You can't find any objects
with this man's name on them?

No.

No driver's license,
no business card,

no such object has ever surfaced.

Here is where all the known objects
are right now.

Can you find me the pen?

Where's the pen?

The pen.

How accurate is this?

It's pretty accurate.

I've collected as much
history of the objects as I can.

The key, for instance...

Just in the last few weeks
you've been spotted in Pittsburgh,

New Mexico, Kansas, Cleveland-

I haven't been to Cleveland.

How far back does this go?

Years.
Back to the beginning for some objects.

What if you mapped
all their movements all at once?

What would that prove?

Well, I'm not sure,
but there might be some sort of a pattern.

Could you just try it, please?

What's that?

What's there?

No object has ever
been through there.

Nothing.
It's the desert.

That's where he is.

The Occupant in the room,

and somehow he is keeping
all the objects away.

I need to borrow your car.

Great. I'll drive.

Give me the keys.

This is all I have.

Give me the keys.

The center of the map
is a town called Green Valley.

It doesn't look like
much of a town.

From the outskirts
there is a sanitarium.

Good luck.

We have to hit Kreutzfeld hard and fast.

It's not going to be easy getting in.

Leave that to me.

I have someone
on the inside.

Look, none of us have ever
done anything like this before.

We have no idea
what we're getting into.

But if we don't at least try,

we're going to end up
dead anyway, so...

let's go.

What are you doing?

Hey. How are you?

It's a little project.

It's going to take awhile, though.

But I remember Anthony said something
about making ice cream, though.

That wouldn't interest you, would it?

Okay.

And close the door, will you, buddy?

We're in position.

Very good.
Wait for my signal.

Yeah?

They're about to attack.

Wise man.
You made the right choice.

No one's here.

Something's wrong.
I think it's a trap.

Get out.
Get out now.

Let's go.

Don't.

It won't heal.

Objects don't work in the room.

Hi.

Visiting hours are over.

Police business.

I'm here to see a patient.

Police?
Well, okay, sure.

Who's the patient?

John Doe.

You do have a John Doe here?

Yeah.
He's always been here.

You should empty your pockets.
He doesn't like things.

What do you mean?

Things-stuff, pens, wallets, keys.

It freaks him out.

The firearm?

It stays with me.

My name is Joe Miller.

I just want to ask you-

No!

Easy! Easy!

Easy! It's okay!

Look, it's okay.

I'm not going to hurt you.

Okay?

I'm not going to hurt you.

Okay?

I just want to talk to you,
that's all, all right?

I'm just going to sit down right here, okay?

No!

No! Stop!

Damn.

Oh, my God.

Who the hell are you?

I just want to know who you are
and what happened in that motel room

and if you created the obj-

Stop talking!

I met your wife Mabel.

She gave me your picture.

She misses you...

even if she doesn't remember you.

I felt the photograph coming.

I thought maybe you
might have been my wife.

I let you through.

I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry.

Please, it's very important.

I just need to know,
did you create these objects?

I didn't.

Then where did they come from?

I don't know.

I didn't do anything.

It just happened.

I need your help.

My little girl went into that motel room
and she never came out.

Can you tell me where she is?

She's still there.

Where?
In the room.

No, she's not.
I've been there. She's gone.

There's more than one.

What do you mean there's more than one?

There's more than one.
Come on!

Can you bring her back?

Please tell me you can bring her back.

I can't.

But you can.

How?

How can I bring her back?

Take me to the motel room.

You almost had me there,
Jennifer.

Yeah, too bad.

Didn't think you had it in you.

I want you to witness
what I'm about to do.

I know you're scared of it,

but if I'm right-

if I'm right...

You're not.

I won't harm you unless you interfere.

I saw him.

He...

I saw...

I've come a long way, Martin.

Margaret?

Margaret, I saw him.

I saw the man in the room.

What man?

I saw him through
this Polaroid...

at the motel.

I saw the Occupant...

the living object.

This isn't true.

None of it.

He gave me a vision in the desert.

He told me that
The Order was wrong.

He said that if I could put

all the objects
back together agaln,

that I wouldn't
just talk to God.

He said I would be God.

That's why you won't kill me.

I'm the Prophet.

Lee.

I knew you'd come.

Ruber!

Don't smile at me like that.
I want some answers.

Who killed Lou Destefano?

I did.

What happened to Anna Miller?

The motel room took her.

You know the motel, Lee.
You dreamed about it.

How did you know that?

The motel room is where
the objects come from.

And they protect me.

I'm the Prophet of the Objects now.

Good-bye, Lee.

You're under arrest!

Stop, Ruber, or I will
put a hole in you!

When you're ready to know
the objects, Lee, come find me.

It's ready.

I'm nervous, Anthony.

Karl, please don't do this.

I want to see my son.

No!

Daddy?

Isaac.

Daddy?

Yeah.

Isaac, no.

No, Isaac, please. No.

Please!

Come back!

Karl, don't!

I want to see my son.

No!

Don't, Joe!

Stop!

I feel like myself agaln in here.

Outside...

in the real world,
there's so much...

noise in my head.

It's quiet in here.

Who are you?

I used to be a man
named Eddie McCIeister.

Used to be?

And now you're...
what, the prime object?

No, no.
There's no prime object.

I'm just an object like the rest.

I have a will.

That's the only thing
that makes me different.

Except you're allive.

Yeah, unfortunately.

Unfortunately?

Outside this room...

the objects all sense each other...

always, like paln,
electricity, noise.

For a conscious mind, it's torture.

You said I could bring my daughter back.

How do I do that?

You have to kill me.

No.

I can't.

You can.

Even if I wanted to,
you shot yourself in the mouth.

You spat the bullet out.
I can't.

You can kill me in this room.

Take the burden.

What burden?

Become an object.
Take my place.

No. I don't understand.
How is that possible?

One object is destroyed,
another is created:

conservation of objects.

Eddie, I can't.

I don't want that.

I want to die.

You want to see your daughter agaln,
you have to kill me now, here,

in this motel room.

No.

No, I won't be a murderer.

Take out your gun...
please.

End this.

No.

Look, there's a price
for everything, Joe.

This is the price to get your daughter back.

Kill me please.

I'll get my daughter back?

Will my past be erased...

like yours was?

I don't know.

Will my daughter remember me?

I don't know, but she'll be allve.

I'm sorry.

God forgive me.

Are you all right?

What happened?

Where is he?

Sorry.

Joe?
He's gone.

Joe, what did you do?

You have to reset me.

I'm gonna go in the room.

I want you to reset it with the key.

I can't.

You're gonna disappear just like Anna did.

I won't.

I promise.

Better come back.

I will.

Please bring my daughter back.

Please bring my daughter back.

Please.

Daddy!
Anna!

You're okay?

You okay?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Sure you're okay?

You all right?

Is that bad man gone?

Yeah.
Yeah, the bad man's gone.

Okay?

But, Anna, you're safe with me now, okay?

You're safe with me.

Yeah.

All right, banana?

Okay, let's get out of here.

Oh, my God.

How is she?

Oh, she's all right.

You're okay, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.
She's okay.

Anna, this is Jennifer.

Hi.
Hi.

Jennifer, this is my daughter Anna.

What is it?
Where are we?

I will tell you the whole story later, okay?

Okay.

Right now I just have
one last thing to do,

and then we got to go.

Okay.
Stay right here.

What are you doing?

Trying to put an end to this.

Let's go.

Where are we going?

Some place far away from here.

You okay?
Yeah.
