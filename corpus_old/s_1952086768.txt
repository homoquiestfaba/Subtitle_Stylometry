REGIONAL PSYCHIATRIC
CENTER

Dear Karla. You now have eight years of
your sentence of twelve-year sentence ...

and is eligible
for sentence.

To this end you will be transferred to
this device for an investigation.

After this
it is my responsibility ...

to you whether or not to contribute
for early release.

Karla, it's important
that we assess ...

in all openness and honesty
perform in all respects.

Just as I should
for everything to appeal.

Hi, Karla.
Day, Dr. Arnold.

You look good.
-Thank you

I feel good.

Last month, I graduated.

Congratulations.

Graduating in prison.
That is not small.

Can I smoke? That relaxes me.
-Make yourself at home.

I have my pajamas with me.

And where do you want to discuss?

If you go to these pictures look ...

what you feel it now?

I do not know.

This is fun.

God, what was he handsome.

But he was more than that.
He was a musician, composer.

He dreamed of making movies.

He had a good job.
He was intelligent.

He led the life
I dreamed of.

That was when he just knew.

Yes. I was eighteen.

I was with my friend and colleague Peggy
at a conference in Toronto. In a hotel.

We sat in the restaurant,
looking for guys.

Peggy, turn you 's all about.

God, what is he handsome.

Then I Paul 's first saw ...

it sounds naive, but I knew
that I would marry him.

Are they?

He was really perfect.

Can we come?
-Yeah, sit down.

I'm Karla,
this is my friend Peggy.

I'm Paul Bernardo.
This is my custom Nick.

Where you stay?
-Here in the hotel.

For the veterinarian conference.

So why do you make the beast in me.
O, my god ...

Nice.

Jesus ...

If you do not want, please do not.

Oh my god ...

You are so beautiful. I love you.

Was that not what daring?
Free with a nice guy?

With friends there?

Do you even do giant exciting.

Please appreciate that he was older.

I wanted to show him that I notice.

You've started
certain sex games.

I know what you mean
allowing nothing.

Tell me about.

Okay.

That was when he 's first
home with me.

And when I had a surprise for him.

What is that?
-Keep your mouth. Do them.

Put?

I want you to fuck me.
-Should I fuck you?

If I was a rapist?
-Great. Come in me.

He said: Suppose that a rapist
, and you said, it's crazy.

Never heard of horny talk?

More was not it?
-For me.

Talking sex. Everyone does that.

He says that he
by your relationship is started.

With rape.

This is bullshit. He raped
all girls before I knew him.

And you knew that?

Paul lived two hours drive
away from me.

I did not know what he
outside it was weekend.

He talked only about his work,
his music and his ideas for films.

You did not know that he was suspected
of rapes in Scarborough?

There was once someone in the newspaper
which he appeared.

But after years I discovered more.

You did not know that he was interrogated?
-Only much later.

Gus, did you read The Sun?
Paul is on the front page.

I have not seen.
-You must watch, it's really Paul.

That's the rapist ...

But other than Nick
saw the similarity.

Worse than a job.

We had all these tips
now examine.

Snap it. Everyone makes fun little
that portrait.

What should I say?
I love women.

I have a beautiful fiance
in St. Katherine. I would never do.

Would you like a blood away?
Then we can exclude.

Of course, what you want.
-Good. There has been nothing wrong.

We have not previously discussed.
It is difficult.

But as I report
to draw up ...

I would like
about your sister Tammy have.

You think you handle it?
-Sure. Why not?

Paul says that you were jealous of Tammy.

That was not me.

He fell on her because she was a virgin.

He did much that I not a virgin
was. He wanted something Puurs.

And Tammy was pure?
For him, maybe.

They were a good band.

That was not you mind?

I must warn you.

I can only report positive
if you are honest.

That I do not understand.
-This time when she came home so late?

We know a lot about your jealousy.
The summer of 1990.

Go inside. Inwards.

You were eight hours away.
-So?

Have you fucked her?
-Jesus, I have not fucked her.

She is a virgin, yes?
-It is a slut.

I know you want it.
Enter it again.

Well. So what?

So what? I want her.

I love you, there is the question.
-We are engaged, Paul.

Your faith with me?

Of course.

I love you too.

I love you so much, it's too much.

It is never too much.

You had him, if necessary, Karla.

Were you really afraid of him
Tammy to get rid of?

You give me the feeling
I need a painkiller.

Want one?

We are ready.

See you tomorrow, Karla.

If you are equipped,
we talk about Tammy.

You love chocolate, I remember.

You love me, Karla?
-You are my king.

And if your king now
something of value to have?

If the king wants a virgin?

The king is the king.

But if Virgin do not want?

They do not even know.
-You 're talking about Tammy, Paul.

I do not know.
-Come on, Karla.

It would create a bond between us.
Forever.

Where you work in the veterinary clinic.
Since they have resources.

I do not know.
-I know you.

Anesthetics for dogs and cats.
Halothane.

This is for animals.
-It can not hurt.

Come on, that is the king now.

Do you do for me?

Kar, I am your king.

It would be a nice Christmas.
Come on.

Not soon after our engagement party.
-You had promised.

Everything is still ready?

So I know you again. My girl.

And we have sister Tammy ...

its version number daiquiri?
Second, third?

Are you with two?
O boy, sister is a bit fed up?

What do you think?
Thus to see it.

And tell 's Tammy,
are you in Christmas mood?

That is sweet. Do that again.

Lovely.
Jesus, what makes me horny.

Here, drink this.

Beautiful as that.

They had an hour sleep.
-Not too much.

They will get nothing.

I love you.
-I love you too.

More than you realize.
-Really?

Here, baby. Drink only once.

Finally. Check whether they really gone.

Get it.

Remove that piece and that stuff.
Get it.

Honey, what great
you give me this. I love you.

Well, do it.

Come on, do it.

I love you, Paul.
-I know, honey.

Put it on her face.

That is sweet, huh? Is not that sweet?

I asked you what.
-Yes, very nice.

Strip.
-What?

Strip.
-We would ...

Just do it.

And now suck.

Come on, suck on her breast.

You do not.
Do it now but just.

Paul, just to shoot.
-Do it. Mouth open, insert your tongue out.

I can not.
-You could.

Dirty slut, you've ruined my film.
Do this no more, you hear me?

She breathes not.
-Dick not.

Paul, it breathes no more.
-Dick not Karla.

What do you do, damn it?

Hello? Dundonald Street 61.
Send someone, my sister breathes no more.

Yes, 61. You should send someone.

The ambulance is coming.
You remain calm.

Over the mess left on,
I do more.

Wake up, damn it.

It is all good.

It is not good.

I feel no heartbeat, you what?

Prefer to wait outside.

We sat with his three
a video to watch.

We must have fallen asleep
Tammy and then made a sound.

What noise?
-They hijgde, as if she choked.

Yes, they choked.

Detective Porter.

Right. Thank you.

My participation.

I hold up, but we must
now to the agency.

Where is the video?
-In a safe place.

In my letter: Dear Tammy,
I carry you forever in my heart.

I give you all my love.
Your big sister Karla.

PS: I hope you are happy
in God's hands.

And you thought that?

Absolutely.

But you made a few weeks
after her death a film with Paul.

The Tammy movie.

Nothing is taboo, Karla.

You can tell me what you did.
Tell me why.

We have a lot of films.

He was ...

He was obsessed with Tammy.

I wanted him to lose.

He gave me the guilt of her death.
I had to do something.

But this time the movie was your idea.

This time, yes.

I had another drink.

I must relax.

My life task
is to ensure that you feel good.

I saw how my sister fucked.

How her virginity.

Tomorrow we at Tammy's grave.

It has your intimate places
touched.

I gave you her virginity instead
of mine. So much I love you.

I did because I love you.
Because you are my king.

And that suggested Paul satisfied?

For a while maybe.
He had many problems.

He lost his job. His mother continued
him out, he lived with my family.

And he always turned the Christmas video.
That went on.

I had to look forward
and our friends too.

You have done what you could.
-Here it is done.

Not give up,
we drag you through.

You know what, you should
back on scratching.

I wish you a proposal.

You need money, right?

I have a partner.

What do you mean?
-Cigarette smuggling.

Provides about three, four grand
per month.

Go on, that sounds interesting.

Did you mind that it was illegal?
-That money was fine.

For the first time we could make plans.
But the link was.

Toronto.

Drive through.

Successful.
-Damn, we have pulled.

A few times per month
Nick and he went across the border.

From the money he hired
a beautiful house in Port Lucy.

A dream became reality.

What a treasure.

After Tammy was he ... I do not know.

He had changed. Sometimes it was good,
sometimes it was common.

More than that.
-I will do.

No, I said: Do it. Now.

What did I just say?

I had to clean up.
-Yes, and you do what I say.

I give you a nice house and you let
the dog under the piss? Come on.

Not your fault.

Sometimes he said that he hated me.
Could it not care.

That was the fixed pattern
Port Lucy?

Sometimes. But there were also
good periods.

We were Friday We were independent.

Do you like that?
-Great.

Come here, play.

But there was something else.
-Go on.

You asked when I heard that he
girls raped. That was then.

He hid no longer.
It was like ...

Like what?

He had that video of Tammy. He knew
I could not identify him.

How many girls?

Four, five in that time. I know
not exactly. At least four.

Hi, honey.
-Where were you?

I just raped a girl.

I got this off her arrested.

I'm going to burn.

What is there now?

I wish that we will be happy,
as before.

But you hate me too much.

I hate you, princess.

Sometimes you say that.
-Yes, but that is when I'm angry.

I love you, Paul.

We are still married?

Come here, baby.

Of course we married.

Listen, I go with the boys
a week to Florida.

This is my bachelor outing.

And when I get back,
is it all good.

Are you really back?
-Of course.

So Paul left your home
and went to Florida?

Ten days.
-And what did you think?

Nothing.

Just think.

Thinking what?

Tammy, the girl he had raped
before he went to Florida ...

with whom he was ...

and how I could make
that he was holding me.

How I could make him happy.

That would you still?
-I wanted him. I need him.

Thank God.

I loved him.

I missed you.
I-you too, honey.

Come on.

And, you had fun in Florida?

Honey, I'm very tired.

Hou nou op.

I am a girl fucked
Tracy that hot.

If they call, say you
you are my sister, yes?

You're so bad.

And you're really not evil?

I just want
you happy ...

and me coming back.

You are incredible.

He slept all day. Around ten that
evening he and dressed him.

I go out with friends.
That I take them to the case.

He was not left since Florida.
I wanted him to stop.

I wanted to scream
that he should remain with me.

But I could not.
I did not know what I had to say.

Key forget. I can not.
-It is a quarter to twelve.

You save it?
-Sure. Until tomorrow on the case.

What are you doing?

I live here.

And you?

I just wanted to hack your neighbors.

Got a cigarette?

Yes, in the car.

What is your name?
-Tina McCarthy. And you?

Does not matter.

What is it?
-I have someone down.

No, just stay here.

Come, laugh even a little. Laugh.
Say you name it.

Tina McCarthy.
-Good. Where is that smile?

So, yes.

That is very nice.

Keep laughing, huh?

Very good, Tina, very nice.

Now I want you bloesje pull.

Yes, but again.

Go ahead.
Do it slowly.

Keep laughing.

This is fun?

Do you not me?

Keep laughing.

That is good. That is really good.

Hi, honey.

Are you sure
that no one has seen?

When?
-When you kidnapped her.

No, nobody saw me.
I bring her to our bedroom.

I would not be alone.

You do not.

Come on.

Tina, time for games.

My little brother called Patrick.
I am very fond of him.

I want so bad to him.

I want you back uitkleedt for me.

Yes, if I like.

What about sex
with two people?

Say that it is a girl.

It is also a girl, Tina.

Well, now you get
a nice big kiss.

A nice, fat kiss.

Close your eyes, honey.

You are doing well.
You're my little chippy, Tina.

I just want to go home,
to my brother.

Can I come home?

You like me. You are doing well.

Eyes closed. What you do now will determine
what we do with you.

Damn. Eyes closed, I said.

Karla, come here.

Wil see that they recognize us?

Do you want me for 25 years
the tank in turn?

I have to murder her, damn.

I have no choice.
I need her murder.

Stupid bitch.

Give her at least a sleeping pill,
so they feel nothing.

It's good, sweetheart.

Here, drink it.

I had said
you should keep your eyes closed.

My god ...
-Shut up.

Shut up.

Shut up.

What are we doing?

We are tired, yes?

We should not decide
we do something stupid.

Good, but you can its
not miss.

Where have you left her?

In the basement.

Go shower, baby.

I had a good idea. Cement.
-Cement?

As we cast her.
We saw it in eight pieces.

I can not.
-You do what I say.

I do not. Fuck you, Paul.

That head was so light.
The drop is so. It's in there.

I got it painted black,
because its still stuck there.

If it is dark,
you help me load.

And it was still not on
to him way to go?

I've thought about it.

But the wedding was two weeks ...

and I thought he would change.

And you, Karla?

Were you changed
what happened?

I just wanted to marry.

Dear Paul, I love you so much.

Once we were unbeatable,
together against the world.

I want that love back. Despite
our problems as I love you.

They see us as an ideal couple.
That we are, but what error.

It must be a fairytale marriage.
I love you. Karla.

You went on honeymoon
to Hawaii.

Paul has beaten me rotten.

Why?

He wanted a girl to. Not me.

On our honeymoon, actually.

But the videos that Paul
Then, you be very happy.

Of course.

I would never ruin his films.
I had learned that lesson.

After your return you had a conversation with
Dan and Molly Czehowicz. Who was that?

The clinic where I worked, had them
been. Mol and I were still friends.

They were not Paul,
but were fond of me and Buddy.

Steve and Becca called, they come later.
-O, fun.

And that girl in the lake
identified.

What girl in the lake?
In pieces cut in cement blocks.

Paul, you have nothing?

No, no, I slipped.

He's just tired.

Okay, I do this and then we left.

You guys are just too exhausted
by the long flight.

Because you did so fucking stupid.

Me? You were right?
-To you cover. That face of yours.

Good thing Molly
just as stupid as you are.

Paul, what are we doing?
-Nothing.

They are really not.

How calm he was,
I think he was scared.

He was a quiet time.

One, two, three.

That winter it was heavy. He did not
what he wanted and had to improvise.

Drink, drink ...

I'm no good, I go to bed.

What a dick.
His wife is fucking up.

Jessie, I'm not so good.

I got her off licks. From jealousy she
Karla's toothbrush poison.

Your wife is over, man.
What are you doing?

If you treat her so,
go away from her.

What do you think of my marriage?
Karla does not.

Why is she not?

Stupid bitch, you got your school does not agree
completed. You are a stupid bitch.

Well, it is enough, dirty bastard.

Nick, stop.

You know there is no bag.

My house.
-Go away, Nick.

You're crazy. I got you
that all concerned. For you.

These cigarettes. Ungrateful dog.

Get out and take
that stupid whore of you.

Fuck you.
-Where was that now about?

Not in the winter to gobble him.

He got all his friends lost
and did nothing about. But I do.

I wish he came to rest.

Dear Paul, tomorrow is Good Friday
and Easter, you know?

Three blissful days for Karla
with its king.

That is a good one.

What do you want me to do?

What we have agreed.

Sorry, can you tell me the way?

We find the Penn Center.
Straight-and right at the traffic lights.

Sorry, you don 't
on the map show?

Thank you.

So we are here ...
-No, one street away.

You drive by and at the traffic light ...

Are good.

Grab it. Get her.

Let me go, let me go.

Let me go.

Shut up. I am able
this, so shut up.

Relax. Stay here, shut the phone off,
I have her alone.

Doin 'a scratch.

Whatever happened in the car.

You okay, honey?

Remember: Smile for the camera.

Excuse me, I wish you do not hurt.

What is that?

From my friend Chris.

Fuck you with him?

No, I am a decent girl.
-No, you're not.

You're a slut. Say it.

I am a slut.
-Yes, my sex slaves of St. Mary.

You are my master.

This suits me.

She lost a shoe.

What is your shoe?

Weather that nightmare.
-I know you.

The parents.

Mr. and Mrs. Ross?

You are my chippy of St. Mary.

Say it. Say it, damn it.

Like you just said.

Communication problem. I want
you talk to me, that you can.

Say that you love me. "I love
you, Paul. " Say that you love me.

Say: 'I love you, Paul.
I love you, Paul ... "

I love you.

Stupid bitch, what is wrong with you?

Some things are worth
to die.

Oh yeah? Who am I?

A bastard.

What? What did you say?

Stupid bitch.

Excuse me. You are my master.

Excuse me, I had not
say. I have earned punishment.

Yes, I think
you have earned punishment.

My sletje of St. Mary
has earned punishment.

Then I feel even better.

Who wants me?
All-girls St. Mary ...

want to fuck with you, because you are
most powerful, most sexy man in the world.

Fucking slut.

Give me a tissue.

What is that? What should I so?

Stupid slut stupid slut.
A meeting of stupid sluts.

I go get something to eat.

Try nothing.

If they try something, just do this.

Does he always against you?

Always.

Why stay you?

You can not understand.

I know all this
was not your idea.

You understand it.

Our daughter is a sweet child.
She has never done something bad.

Hey, get up. Go get her.

Give us her back.

Give her a chance to live.
We will help you to leave it behind.

In your heart you will find a good man.

Please bring her back.
Please.

Honey, if you see this,
make you worry.

Hey, come on.

Believe me, you must have patience.
Be brave.

Hey, you even hear.

I have written. Not bad, huh?

I go shower.

Death is nothing to be afraid of.

I am not afraid.

My parents love me
and Chris likes me.

You can find me doing nothing. You can ...

What you felt when you saw her die?

Nothing.

Nothing?

I thought how easy it was
in order to kill her.

Not like the first time.

It was easy.

I knew that it would continue.
Paul says that you have slain Kaitlyn.

With that hammer.
-That is not true, you know

Many people think so. The
recherche you think the perpetrator was.

The FBl-psychiatrist
and the Canadian national police as well.

Let them fall dead.

Got something to add?

I have killed nobody.

And then Tammy, Karla?

Fuck you.

The newly formed special team believes
that the murderer of Kaitlyn Ross ...

not only worked. He would
half man have worked.

The police are looking for
a cream-colored Camaro.

Those fuckers do not see any difference between "n
Nissan and a Camaro and Karla is a man.

That is still 's smart.

Damn.

Are you Paul Bernardo?

Can I help you? Would you come?

We investigate the death of Kaitlyn
Ross. We came to your name.

Well, that surprised me.

That I had in Toronto also,
after that, Scarborough rapes.

Are you still married?

Is your wife home?
-No, that works.

Where does it operate?
-Dierenkliniek St. Katherine.

And what do you do?
-I am accountant.

Where?
-I actually just looking for a job.

The afternoon of April 16,
the Thursday before Easter ...

you still know where you was when?

O yes. I was here.
Currently with my music.

I got behind a studiootje.

That was about it.

I hear it
if I can help you somewhere.

Good luck.

Damn. The videotapes.

They had no idea.
I was absolutely freezing.

Freezing.
-Are you sure?

Of course. You should have experience.

I am the super knakker, the damespakker,
and there is no agent who knows me ...

as the Scarborough rapist -
there is a lot more behind.

You laugh at all.

Yes.

Not true. I cheerfully lot which
and you are there as a pillar of salt.

Excuse me.

Yes, excuse you.

He was really scared
that they would tackle him.

And for me it became increasingly worse.

There was an explosion when we
in July across the border went.

You will often cross the border.
What do you do in the U.S.?

I ask her.

We have friends
who get married.

Would you both off?

Trunk open.

Okay, thanks.

Thanks to you we were almost in jail.
Damn, stupid bitch.

Never more from something stupid.

What are you doing, bitch?

Very sweet, Kar.

Is that you, Karla? Is everything okay?

No.
-Has he beaten you again?

Can you come?
-We come now.

Fuck you, Kar.

You're fat, you're ugly, you're stupid.

I hate you, damn, dirty bitched.

Fuck you, Karla. Piss off.

Have you nothing?
-Look, they come to save that bitch.

Go away, damn it.
Get out of my house. I hate you.

I bring it to the car.
-Get my house is Karla.

Come on.

Princess, wait.

Princess, my dear.
Come here please.

Do not do it, Karla.
-I am perfectly calm, you see it?

I need you just like to speak.

Please, go not away.

Come on.

Karla ...
-It is good, Mol.

What are you doing?
You can not leave.

I go away.
-You are insane.

I can destroy your life. For Good.

I'll let your parents see the film
Tammy kill you.

Would you still welcome them to be?

You think?
Think it well over, Kar.

Come on, Karla.

Why should it go so well?

Why can we not
start over?

It does not have to go, and you can.

How sweet.

Come to bed, honey.

"Come to bed, honey. '

Please, Paul.

'Please, Paul. "

Do you really think you
something can get away with impunity?

Do that over.

What is that?
-Put.

On your knees, slut.

Ass up.

If so, damn.

If yes.

Shut up, damn it.

I do not want a thrill to hear.

Yes, that's it.

Keep your head up. Keep your head up.

Wish you were dead, bitch? Wish you were dead?

I'm far too nice to you,
you know that?

I'm too nice to you.

You stay here tonight.

Together with Tina McCarthy.

What were you doing?

Hello Molly Czehowicz?

You're still a friend of Karla?

Who is this?
-A friend. She needs you.

All good.
-Not True. They called me ...

A car accident, I said.

After my work I
things pick up.

Come now.
-Take me tonight.

Paul, the cross and is only
late. I make sure I'm ready.

But that was not me.

I thought about what he would do if I got it
again worked. I was terrified.

It kills me when they leave.
-No, Karla.

We find a safe place
for you, really.

He likes me.

You go to the hospital
and then ...

I have a cousin who has flats,
in Brampton.

Paul knows him.

Grievous bodily harm, says the doctor.
We deal with him.

Is he in jail?
-For one night only.

If necessary we can
impose a restraining order.

Hello, darling. I am.

They loved him but a solid night.

So that solved nothing?
-For me.

But they focused on Paul.

They viewed the ancient DNA samples
Paul again.

Detective Kirby.

Three rape cases
I have a DNA profile.

The guy in St. Katherine.
The Scarborough-rapist.

But it could legally
have not create.

There was more evidence is needed.
She followed him.

Day and night follow
and tap his phone off.

Whether I was in a cage is.
I can not even call.

Pull you're 's. Go to the barber.
Clean, search work.

Say that you regret abuse.
-Hell anyway.

Hear 's, I am your friend, but if you
treat me so, I step in, understand?

Sorry, I just ...
-What?

What do you think of the death of Tammy?

I do not know. Rare case, I think so.

T you? A girl of sixteen
that just die?

Girls of sixteen are not
just dead. Think.

Karla has her. I
on video. They did.

And there you have a picture of?
-A live recording, yes.

In color. And if I abuse
should be, I sleep with everyone.

Calm down it.
-If you knew s, Doug ...

Someone who does everything
its back. Also destruction.

If they come back,
I really love her.

You understand that everything you say ...

That is the legal duty.

I can not do what you harm.
Only help you.

What are we exactly?

The murders of Tina McCarthy
and Kaitlyn Ross.

Since you information about?
-More than information.

I did not do it,
but I was there.

If you me 's all said,
from the beginning.

How did you feel,
after 't visit to the lawyer?

For the first time beyond the control of Paul.

And that was a wonderful feeling.

That is a whole other world existed
I had forgotten.

It was there again.
A fantastic feeling.

Hello, beauty. Dancing?

This does not sound good,
because of poor recording ...

I sit and cry and stuff.

But I say this to you, girl.

I still love you.

And ...

I know how kloterig
I have treated you.

Excuse me so much.

Had I but when you gevreeën
while I'll aankeek.

I would like ...

I wish we had a child.

I love you, honey.

I miss you so.

Why, Karla?

Why not?

It was so delicious
to forget.

What happiness address
and not to let go.

I felt if I was eighteen again,
before I knew Paul.

An opportunity to begin again.

But you could not start again, huh?

But I've tried.

Paul Bernardo, 57 Bayview Lane?

With whom?
-I can give you an offer ...

With whom? What do you want? No interest.

After eight years has finally
an arrest in the Scarborough case.

This is Paul Bernardo, 28. He is
this afternoon in his house arrest.

He rented with his wife,
Karla Homolka ...

still wanted by the police.

Who has information about her,
is asked to call the police.

Hopefully this
an end to this case ...

so many for so long
have lived in fear.

I was going out to eat,
and when I came back ...

Karla Saturday in the living room to cry.

I ran up,
and Kaitlyn was dead.

She lay there with a rope around her neck
and there was blood.

Kaitlyn was not upset
when you had her?

She saw her father on TV and wanted
escape. You hit her with a hammer.

In the struggle they pulled the rope
around her neck and wurgde themselves.

That is a lie.
I've never beaten someone.

And when Paul came home,
they lay dead on the ground.

That is a lie.

Paul twisting everything out of there
to come. But he is the perpetrator.

I know that I am terrible things
have done ...

and a lot of people pain
and sorrow have worried.

I have much regret.

And I know I have earned punishment.

But I did not kill those girls.

Paul had two murders lifelong
without penalty.

I was 12 years. There were protests
of victim groups.

They found the sentence too light.

When I hear the outcome?
-The committee shall decide within ten days.

You think I Kaitlyn Ross
kill you, right?

I report on what you
in the future can do.

Not about what you
in the past have done.

I am not a psychopath, you know?

In the cell I am safer. There seem
people who want me dead.

Maybe it's just better.

Goodbye, Karla.

Some think
Kaitlyn and I have killed Tina.

I have not done.

But Dr. Arnold was right.
I have someone killed.

I killed my sister.

How can I ever be forgiven?

I think every day what I did.

Really.

From the report: Karla is manipulative,
egocentric and narcissistic ...

and acted not only
under pressure from Paul Bernardo.

Despite its good presentation ...

they show lack of moral awareness
and empathy with its victims ...

suggesting
to psychotic tendencies.

They received no sentence.

In the years after she had a relationship
with a detainee ...

who had murdered his girlfriend.

On July 4, 2005 came after 12 years Friday

Because they showed no regret, consider the 
Court her a danger to society. 

Her freedom was restricted. 

The families of the victims 
reported in October 2005 ... 

that Karla Homolka to that moment 
had expressed no regret.
