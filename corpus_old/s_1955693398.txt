<font color=#FFFF00><i>There is a meadow..
in my perfect world.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Where wind..
dances the branches of the tree...</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... casting leopardâ€™s spots of light
across the face of pond.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>The tree stands tall...
and.. grand and alone,</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... shading the world beneath it.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>There will come a day when I rest
against its spine...</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... and look out over a valley where
the sun warms, but never burns.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>I will watch leaves turn..</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Green, then amber,
then crimson.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Then no
leaves at all...</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>But the tree will not die.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>For in this place,
winter never comes...</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>It is here,
in the cradle of all I hold dear,</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... I guard every memory of

<font color=#FFFF00><i>And when I find myself frozen in

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... far from

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... I will return to
this place, close mine,...</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>... and take solace in the simple
perfection of knowing you.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Subtitled by Clarity.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see Wyman's sheep dogs near
the flock?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Nope.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Told me he had six dogs watching
over it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No. I am not to tell you..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I got a call from Tribal Police,
chief was asking for you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There was a mountain lion working through
the flocks east of Boulder Flats.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You'd think folks would realize this
isn't sheep country.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, tore up a horse and some weanlings
too.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That sounds like wolves.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Chief says it's a cat, and they
ain't had no luck getting it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give him a call.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. Drop those off at Fish and Game.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You got blood on your shirt..
Just getting for work..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Who was the victim today?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Looks like it's gonna be me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Want some coffee?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Sure...
Great.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So, I gotta go to the Rez tomorrow,.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>thought I'd take Casey by

<font color=#FFFF00>Something killed a yearling in the pasture
behind their house.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah... That's why I'm going.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Don't let Casey out of your sight
on the Rez, okay?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said, I'm gonna leave him
with your folks while I scout.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You know what I mean.
Yeah, I do. I won't.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Case.
Dad?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Come on, bun... time to go.
Okay, I am coming.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay.
Don't run.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll be back Monday afternoon.
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need him to be missing school
to go chasing coyotes with you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.. alright.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Is this it?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- No, no. Let him, let him.
Yeah. I know.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He's still learning to
do things for himself.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I agreed, but I've stood here..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>as long as I need to stand here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for the coffee.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Good luck on that interview in Jackson.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Take Togwotee Pass.
And don't go through Pinedale.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>This storm's coming
from the south so...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, you can drag me through
Pinedale with a rope.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Well, good luck.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You hear that?
Cause it's hungry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Chats on boys.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You okay?
Fine.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Gotta push his nose back
when he rubs it on you like that.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay?
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Close the gate for me, would you?
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey zed.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You want zed to be your horse, don't you?
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You are gonna have to prove it. Not to me,
you gotta prove it to him.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Come over here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You gotta earn his respect from him.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>When you do that,
he would be standing on your ground.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Who's got the height advantage now?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Who's got the height advantage?
Just back him up.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Gentle.. so you chose you not to be.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Take him around.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's it. Press her up by his foots.
Keep on going.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There you go.
You show him who's boss.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You are side passing over this way?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There you go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Keep coming.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Back him up.</font>

Good job come over here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let him smell you and breath you.
Let him know you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He will love you forever.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey.. so what do you think of that, son?
That was pretty cowboy, huh..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No, son.
That was Arapahoe.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Entering Wind River,
Indian Reservation</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, grandson.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma's making you fried bread.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Had breakfast?
Just eggs.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead. Get you some.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Horses sense a storm.. huh?
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So.. Police chief called you
to hunt the lion, eh?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He called me to hunt something.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Heard you
lost a steer?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, I'll show you where.
It's a lion.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Is the right?
Come on.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- How Wilma?
She got a job interview.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Jackson, some hotel I think.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Jackson Hole?
Ya.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Gonna live with the millionaires, eh?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Haven't heard about that, I think..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>..the billionaires chased out
the millionaires years ago.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, save your money.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>When the wolves start eating
their Golden Retrievers...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>...that land's gonna go
for pennies on the dollar.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yes sir.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me what that is.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's a lion alright?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There's two.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Three.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She's got both of last
year's kits with her..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They chased your steer around for a while,
it seems.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's what the tracks say..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Momma's teaching her kits how to hunt.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>she's teaching 'em on livestock.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Mother just got her
whole family killed.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Got gas in your slate?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I need emergency assistance.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Repeat. Emergency assistance
requested... Come back?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Fremont County Sheriff's office.
What's your location?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The Wind River Indian Reservation,
east of Boulder Flats.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>FBI's taking a while, eh?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Eh..and the road out of Riverton's bad.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to move her
until they have a look.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm not gonna try to pull
her out after dark.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We gotta get
this show on the road.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We're losing the tracks.. Ben.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Now, it is coming down pretty good.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Should let me follow 'em while I
still can.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Can't let you do that.
Until it's all cleaned by the FBI.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Called her folks yet?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No, I want to take the body to Lander.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I know, it looks like Natalie, but...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>It's Natalie.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There's your Feds.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What are these fools doing?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Can't see the road..
We don't have time for this.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get 'em.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Your destination is on the left.
Where?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Turn left.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you want me to turn left?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>FBI?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Tribal Police?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No, I am here to take you to him.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Look very close. Just follow me, ok?
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Jane Banner.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You're by yourself?
Yeah, it's just me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Ben Shoyo,
I'm the Indian Tribal police chief.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He's Cory Lambert,
with Fish and Wildlife.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He's the one who found the body.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And this is his father-in-law,
Dan.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He don't do nothing.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We got the same job eh?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to meet under these circumstances.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So. Do You wanna
show me the body?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mean to be rude, but I'm
freezing my ass up here, so...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The quicker the better.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that's gonna get a lot worse
if you go out there dressed like that.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a big girl, thank you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Body's 5 miles on a snowmobile.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You'd be dead by the time we
got there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I got the call when
I was in the court in Riverton.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So this is.. this is what I've got.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You should have a winter-gear bag
in that truck.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not a government vehicle,
it's a rental, actually I'm from Vegas.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So I'm just the closest agent
to the scene...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You don't think I
can make it..?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You're from Vegas?
No, I'm not from Vegas,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm stationed there.
I'm from Fort Lauderdale.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, if we're gonna keep
having this conversation...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get you fixed up inside.
It's gonna be great - Thanks.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry excuse me. Thanks.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>See what they send us?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thermals can make underwear wedge
up your bottom,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>but I guess yours
are already there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Here, these should fit.
You're skinny.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You got gloves?
No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What were they thinking
sending you here?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You bring them back the minute you're done.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They ain't a gift.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You hear me?
Yes, of course.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm... bundled.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.
Hey, buddy.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna need a couple more hours,
for work.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>A couple.
This is our day.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I promise.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay?
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Hang with Grandpa.
Sweeten up. Let's go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>God, there was blizzard
here 20 minutes ago.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Comes in waves. Could be sunny for an hour.
Then you're right back in hell again.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Storm will come back.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- That's something to look forward to.
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Over here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You Got a positive ID?
Not positive, no.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Natalie Hanson.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We'll call that positive for now.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Does she lives close by?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, Fort Wakashie.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- North a ways.
What's a ways'?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>About a 30 minutes drive.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ok, well, she didn't run from home then.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She's frozen solid.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No one reported her missing?
Her parents?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that's why we called you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How experienced is your medical examiner?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Just to say... He stays busy.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Order a rape kit,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>When he's done with his prelim,
I want her body sent to Lovelind.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure her belongings
go with her... they need to get tested too.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm listing this as a homicide.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How well do you know this land?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Like it's my job. Which it is.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Well is there anywhere she could be
running from? Is there anything close by?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Nearest houses..
3.5 miles from here southeast.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Sam Little featherâ€™s place is over there..
Yep.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Those boys could use some
serious looking into.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There's no structures closer?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There are drill rigs five miles from here..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They got trailers for the workers., but...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's closed for the winter.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So why would a teenage girl be out here?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Well kids come out here on their
snow machines.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And have a big party in the snow.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Not barefoot.. they don't.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think?
I know what the tracks say.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay, That's all we got.
Come here, I'll show you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Come right here. See this one..
See how the toes turned out?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>..the front is much deeper than the back.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That says she was running.
Come here, let me show you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She ran until she dropped.. here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>See the pool of blood
where her face hit the snow.?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Now it gets twenty below here
at night.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So if you fill your lungs up
with that cold air.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>when you're running..
it could freeze em up.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Your lungs fill up with blood,
you start coughing it up</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So.. wherever she came from,
she ran all the way here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Her lungs burst here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She curled up in that tree line
drowned up in her own blood.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How far do you think someone
can run barefoot out here?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Oh.. I don't know.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How to gauge someone's will to live...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... especially in these conditions?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But I knew that girl.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She was a fighter.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So no matter how far you think she ran...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... I can guarantee you she ran farther.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I got to get back to my son.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, um.. Would you be willing to help me?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I can't.. I couldn't find the way
back to my car if I drive.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I really don't know how
to investigate this in...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.. Can I borrow him for a few days?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What? He doesn't work for me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You got a lion to kill, don't forget.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There's three o 'em. And I didn't.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.. what is it..
what is it that you to again?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Hunter.
You are a lion hunter?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I hunt predators.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Good. Why don't you
come hunt one for me then?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Dad?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, bud.
You happen to can't sleep?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I had a nightmare.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Is that right?
What is it about?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Who was she?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Come over here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Want some milk?
No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She's a girl
who's lost her way in the snow.. that's all.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's work buddy.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Did she die like Emily?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She died in the cold.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So she died like Emily?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, so...
I'm afraid she did.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- I see you found town okay.
Yeah.. barely.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Do the family identified the body?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Did they give you a reason for
not reporting her missing?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Well she stayed with a boyfriend some...
didn't think anything of it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She was eighteen.
Free to do what she wanted.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Have you done this before?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Observed an autopsy?
Yeah?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ah.. no.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Anyone who tells you it gets easy
is a goddamn liar.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get
it over with.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay Randy, you're on the clock.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I've got about five minutes of this with me,
so let's go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be quick</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning, Randy Whitehurst,
the medical examiner.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm Agent Banner.
She's FBI.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, yes. I'm FBI.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- This your first autopsy?
Yes.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, gotta have a first.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's my first on an investigation,
but... I am trained for this, so..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- if we can just get to this. Please.
Yes, ma'am.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>As you see here, she suffered a deep
laceration along her brow line.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Two separated ribs.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Frost bite in
both feet up through her ankles.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Circumstances is your field, not mine.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me show you.
No I don't need it explained</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I need to find whoever...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... chased her to death in this
snow and put him in prison.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>and not calling it...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>This is very prosecutable
as a murder..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Clearly she wouldn't have been
running through the snow</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>if she hadn't been attacked,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't list the cause
of death as a homicide.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... unless it's listed as a homicide.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not here to solve this..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to obtain a
cause of death...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... and send a team here that can.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look, present the rape, present the
assault and I'm sure...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Those aren't under
the jurisdiction of the FBI.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Those fall to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You keep saying sorry,
but you keep doing it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Don't look at me.
Hey, I'm used to no help.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You have six officers on your
entire force...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... to cover an area
the size of Rhode Island.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yes I know that.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No offense, but this will have to curl
up in your lap in order for you to solve it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- I know that too.
We all know it's a murder.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You can have a US attorney to sign off on it
I'm happy to corroborate that,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But I just can't put it
on the death certificate.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I appreciate your passion.
It's not the Fed's usual response.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But Randy is on our side</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>My supervisor sees this report,
he's gonna want me back in Vegas.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Not that I'm much help or anything..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... but I'm all you've got.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.. What's that
hunter's phone number?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ya?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So you never met him.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- And she never talked about him?
Not to me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you let your daughter stay with a
guy that you've never met?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>whose name you don't even know.?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Cause I look around, I see your photos...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- She was an adult..
Barely.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Wyuksa psi wasichu.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- What does that mean?
It ain't good.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Um.. look.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't mean to offend you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to understand the dynamic here,
Mr. Hanson</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to help.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it whenever you people try
to help, it starts with insults.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why she didn't tell me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But she was eighteen.
And I chose to trust her..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I chose wrong.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ok. Well.. um how about your wife,
did your daughter talk to her?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you talk to your mother?
Her name is Annie? Is she here?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- She's in the bedroom..
I'd like to speak to her.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Be my guest.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.
Bedroom's just this way?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Jane.
yeah?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You don't mind, right?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you don't need my permission.
You're an adult.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Barely..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to tell you it gets
easier...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... doesn't.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>If there's
any comfort...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>...it's getting used to the pain I suppose.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I went to a grief seminar in Casper.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You know that?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Don't know why...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted the bad to go away.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Wanted answers
to questions that couldn't be answered.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The counselor came up to me
after the seminar.. sat down next to me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He said something that stuck with me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know of it's what he said.
Or it's how he said...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He says, "I got some good news
and I got some bad news."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The bad news is
you're never gonna be the same.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"You'll never be whole. Not ever again."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You lost your daughter.
Nothing's ever going to replace that.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"The good news is
as soon as you accept that...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... and you let yourself suffer. "</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"You'll allow yourself
to visit her in your mind."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"You remember all the love that she gave."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"All the joy she knew."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The point is, Martin
you can't steer from the pain.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>If you do
you'll rob yourself.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You'll rob yourself of every memory of her.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Every last one.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>From the first step...
to her last smile.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You kill 'em all.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Just take the pain, Martin.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Do you hear me? You take it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>It's the only way to keep her with you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just tired, Cory.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just.. so tired
of fighting this life.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What you do now you is for your boy.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Drugs is his family now.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He's gone too.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Lives right down the damn
road, but it's...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He's gone.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I expect they'll find he's involved
in this somehow.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He is staying with the Little feather
boys, that it?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You're driving this Fed around
so she don't get lost, is that it?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They asked me to do,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Not what I'm doing.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a hunter.. Martin.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think I'm doing?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>If you find out who did this...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care who it is.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You understand me?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Right where they stand.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Then get off my porch
and go do it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Natalie's brother lives here with
Sam and Bart Little feather.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And a real piece of work named Frank Walker.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hanson's kid is bad... but
the others are stone evil.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So.. watch yourself.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't we just..
maybe wait for some backup?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Well, this ain't the land of back-up, Jane.
This is the land of you're on your own.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to this shit.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ya?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We are looking for Chip Hanson. He around?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Not here, brah..
Who are you?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Who the fuck are you?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the FBI, dickhead.
Are you Sam?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You high right now Sam?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How many times have I arrested you?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Chief, wazzup Brah?
Where's your brother?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- He's in prison. Where you put him..
What no parole?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look at that,
the justice system at work.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Reminds me, my PO told me to give you some..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Wait, I got it, I got it right here.
Wait.. Let me see your hands!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Cory watch the back!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Fuck!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Fuck!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>Heros have always killed cowboys.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The other two's outside with Cory.
Let's go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He's still alive.
We need to call EMS.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>EMS is an hour away.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Just leave him.
He's not dead, Ben.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You okay?
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Skinny one's Natalie's brother..
Who's the other one?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That is Frank Walker.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Won't your daddy be proud?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- My dad's in prison, asshole..
I know, I put him there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me what happened to your sister, Chip.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't play dumb.
About what? What happened to her?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What that cracker do?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What crackers?
Was she seeing a white guy?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know him?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you know who he is?
Do you know his name, Chip?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You said was.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you say
was?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Why would she say was?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She just said was.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Because I found her raped and
killed right over there, son.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's why.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You go. I'm going to get
Chip over to Lander.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>See if he give me the
name of this boyfriend.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I tell you..this is how we find him?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No. We go to where he works or
where he lives.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.. where does he work
where does he live.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You think this asshole's
gonna tell you anything? I don't.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look, I know you're looking for clues,
but you're missing all the signs.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Come here, let me show you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>See this here?
This is snow track.. right?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay.
Is he out here on the ridge?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Here... use these.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You see at the end of the ridge here?
Where?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Follow my hand. Can you see my hand?
Hand's all I can see.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>When I take it away.. now look.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You see that? You see the shadow there?
I think so.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Snow's starting to cover.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look up at the base of the mountain.
There you see. Go up the ridge there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You'll see it a lot of easy there.
You see the tracks go up..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>that mountain there?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, I see it.
Alright.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Now his body was found just past there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But someone unloaded the sledge right here,
to go all the way out there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There is no tracks coming back. Why's that?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you.
The answer is out there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey look... um..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how to do this. Okay?
I'm not a tracker.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's okay, it's all I do.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You asked to help you, right?
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We should go while I still can.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Why are we stopping?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>About the storm now...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The trees are too thick to drive.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Gotta walk from here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Put this on.
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Clap them up real tight ok?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Now what?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We walk.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Follow these sledge tracks heading south.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- you ready?
Yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my god.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We went on foot the last half mile of it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>but we blazed a pretty good trail
on the snow.. so,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I could take the boys back up
there if you want.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Iâ€™II talk to the BIA Supervisor,
he just might want you to do that.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The security team over at the rig
got the cameras around their perimeter.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Iâ€™m gonna head up there in
the morning,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>we might get lucky to find
something on the tape.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The two we have in custody
say anything?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They ain't the talking kind,
Jane.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>These kids... they expect to
go to prison.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hell, I think they look
forward to it. You know?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Three hoots, and a cot,
and free cable?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Anything better being here...
the way they see it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Letâ€™s r their DNA against the
semen, see what that tells us.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I talk to him?
No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Cory, anything they might tell you
would be inadmissible in court,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>and anything you tell us would render</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>everything that resulted
inadmissible as well.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What if don't tell you.
If I just knew it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, agent Banner.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ben.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Iâ€™ve known this kid since he could walk.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I gotta canvas the house.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The back doors are only locked
from the inside...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you.
I didnâ€™t do shit.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>All you been doing is shit for
the last few years.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... Itâ€™s this place. Look what it
takes from us.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What it took from you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Iâ€™m not going to stand here
and tell you that life's fair,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Cause it ain't.
To either of us.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But you know, what do we go?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>This land is all we got left.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What is this we shit...?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Only thing native about you is your ex-wife
and a daughter you couldnâ€™t protect</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe if
youâ€™d played detective back then...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's not something you get to talk about.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You hear me?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Over there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You gonna lecture me about
protecting people?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>While you deal the shit thatâ€™s killing â€˜em?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Unlike most people...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... You had every chance to
get the hell out if thatâ€™s what you wanted.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You got the Army. You got College.
Whatever is your choice.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look what you choose.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look what you chose.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>God damn you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I met him.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ya?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, the motherfucker was
almost as old as you.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to fight
his ass.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Natalie wouldnâ€™t let me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Guess love really is blind huh?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He works security on one of them drill site.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>This boyfriend have a name?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Matt... Matt something...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Who does?
Sam knew. Why donâ€™t you ask him?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I think you'll be talking to Sam
long before I do.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You think this is who I wanted to be?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I get so mad..
I want to fight the whole world.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You got any idea what's that feel like.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I decided to fight the
feeling instead. Know why?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Because I fear that the world would win.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you...
Did he say anything?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No. Fuck it..
I don't. I don't wanna know.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Youâ€™re heading for the rigs
tomorrow ain't you? yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Natalieâ€™s boyfriend worked there.
What?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- No, you are not to tell me.
The thing's solve when it will solve.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Cory.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I want you at the rig with us tomorrow.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We don't catch wolves
looking at where they might be.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Head for where they've been.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They've been right here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You okay?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Been better.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Brings all back, doesnâ€™t it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You and Ben and this little FBI girl formed
your own posse to go solve it all, I hear.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Just trying to help.
You won't get the answers..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>..you're looking for.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what you find.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>This is not about Emily.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Good bye, Cory.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Matt Rayburn.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know him?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- That's the guy we found in the snow?
Yes, fingerprints from the database.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He was a security contractor
for one of the drill stations.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Alright.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Is that it?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Am I fired now?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Why don't you come inside? Warm up.
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You.. want something to drink?
Sure.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You got the..
milk and coffee and well water.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Water is good.
Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Right, um.. make yourself at home.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Here you go.
Thanks.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's my daughter Emily.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She passed three years ago.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You want to know how.. do you?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I do, but...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do this.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I was working as an outfitter in Pinedale.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And there was a big snow,
so I found myself with a rare night off.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So I got a motel called the wife,
she can come up stay for the night.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I mean you got 2 kids and when you're
at the mountain for half of the years.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You don't get much time together.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So we had Emily look after Casey
who was 5 at that time.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She was 16.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I guess that word got out that
we are out of town.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So some school friends came over
and some more friends.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And then some people came
that weren't friends.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So a little gathering
turned into a quite the party I guess.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You know there is a lot I don't know.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We got that phone call the next morning.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>From Natalie.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Said that Emily was missing.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She was worried, naturally,
they were best friends.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.. We tried to be
very careful with Emily.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Tried to plan for everything.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She was such a good girl.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But we let our guard down.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. Let me tell you.
Maybe you'll have kids one day.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You cannot blink.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Not once, not ever.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Then there was a guy moving sheep
over by the wind river.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He is the one who found her.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Some 20 miles from our house.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how she got there
or what happened.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Autopsy couldn't tell us much
cause the Coyotes got at her pretty good.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm sorry...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry.
Could you point me...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>towards your bathroom?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Straight up there.
Thanks.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>A Meadow in My perfect world.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Emily wrote that.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>It's what got her accepted into the
summer writing program in Colorado state.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Did she write it to you?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't matter who it's to.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Just matters who it's from.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Look I'm sorry about..
earlier tonight.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just trying to do the right thing here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really know
what the Hanson boy told you but...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't wanna stumble onto something
like today if I can help it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So you know, if he said something
that I should know...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... I would appreciate if you share it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He only said.. he said,
Natalie's boyfriend was named Matt.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And you've already figured out
who that is, so...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You get a call for that information, huh?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to know why you're helping me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Now I do. So..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Tomorrow...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think we could not ride
the snowmobile 80 miles an hour?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, if you wanna end up in a ditch,
we could have jumped over..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Great.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a good night.
All right.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Shaking more than she is.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's cold enough to freeze
a gold digger's ass out here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, below zero, I bet.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, six below,
it's lot colder up here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, bud.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, how are you doing?
What are you doing here?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>These track lead from the
little feather' house to your body.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna follow them.
See where they go?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, well, Jane's the only one with
jurisdiction out there.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Just wanted a few extra badges along.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You wanna walk 'em through this?
Oh sure yeah.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>The drill station has
cameras along its perimeter.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We're hoping one of the cameras
caught something.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And we'll also canvas
Matt Rayburn's trailer.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>See if there is anything
that links him to the assault.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- You have a warrant?
I'm going to ask real nice.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Can't get that from
little feather house?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Now that's a real tough slade
right through two canyons.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And I ain't looking to dig you out so...
I won't recommend it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We'll take the refinery road around.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>See you gotta drive 50 miles to go 5.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome to Wyoming.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Then you people can get to my mothers.
It's spring.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>If you find anything,

I got one..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I got one...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I remember I was stationed up at this place
called Point Mugu right..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... It's about an hour north of LA.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>It's Christmas, I woke up, I'm all alone,
You know. I don't have anybody..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But the navy does a Christmas time,</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>see there's dumb little kids
at the mess hall</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>you know for the guys without family.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't gonna stick around
for that bull shit.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>So I just.. I got my truck
and a high ** out of there..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... and I wound up in a
little mountain town called Ojai.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I get there and it's like.. fruit farms.
Vineyards...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And there is this mountain surrounding it
you know like protecting the town.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And the people there...
like everybody smiles at each other.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They say hello... it's like</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I remember thinking they were all like..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.
They had these looks in their eyes</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Like they ran on some sort of secret
like they had all figured it out.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>There is this mission, the Spanish mission
right there in the middle of the town.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They are having Christmas mass.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They're celebrating Christmas.
70 degrees where you know..</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I just land there pick me
an orange of the tree...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... and sat down on a bench, to listen that
choir singing, eating my orange.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You know that was the best Christmas
I've ever had.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You wanna live there?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Where is the highway?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You know how far that drill camp was
from where I found Natalie's body?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>6 miles, bare foot.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's a warrior.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's a warrior.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You.. you may make 600 feet.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>But you better get going.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want me to do?!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>- Crocodile.
Please don't make me laugh.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>It's an alligator.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I hope it protects you
better than bullet-proof vests right?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I should not joke about that,
it saved your life.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You saved my life.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Jane, you're a tough woman.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You saved your own life.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>We both should be honest.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I got lucky.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Ah. well, luck don't live out here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Luck lives in the city.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Don't live out here.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>It lives where you get hit by a bus or not.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Where your bank is robbed or not.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>At someone's damn cell phone
when he come up to a crosswalk.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's luck, that's winning or losing.
Out here you survive or you surrender.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>That's determined by your strength
and bare spirit.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Wolves don't kill the unlucky deer.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>They kill the weak ones.
You fought for your life Jane.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>And now you get to walk away with it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You'll get to go home.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I know what you're doing.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Will read to you from a magazine.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"10 Signs that He's Into You."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"He looks you in the eye when he speaks."</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Is it supposed to be?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>She ran 6 miles in the snow.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, she did.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No one's missing.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How did he go out?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>With a whimper.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You better go easy on Chip.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I should go get him.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I just need to sit here...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>... You gonna sit for a minute?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You got time to sit with me?</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I ain't going nowhere.</font>
