I would like to tell you
of something that happened.

Out of the desert
some people came.

They were afraid.

They never stopped being afraid.

The journey had been a long one.

Hi.

Listen,

I really need to pee.

It's alright?

No problem.

Can't sleep?

Ray, are you asleep?

No.

I think we should have waited
until they got the plane fixed.

Look sweetie, it's still
in Sukana.. .believe me. ..

Did you get
the pictures developed?

No. I'll do it
when we get home.

Do you think we're ever going
to get there? What time is it?

Honey, why don't you just.. .

He's gotta be going the wrong way.

No, he's not going
the wrong way.

Then why aren't we there yet?

Would you go and talk
to him? Please?

Ray.. .

Hey, how s it going?

Travel this road a lot?

No, I'm following that.

Ray.

Ray.

What are you doing?

I can't find the water.

Here you are.

Hey, hey, there s no reason
to worry, love.

Everything's going as planned,
you'll see.

We're just a bit delayed,
that s all.

I m not really suited to
this kind of thing, Paul.

'Course you are.

It would have been
a much better idea.. .

if you and your f ather
had come on your own.

Rubbish. ..I wouldn't go out travelling
without you now would l, love?

I'm only in the way. You'II
never get to know him like this.

He's got to get
to know you too, alright?

I can take care
of the pair of you, okay?

Hey, where's the road?

That's the road.

180 degrees due South.

This can't be the road to
Emerald Bay, it s a gravel path.

It is the road.

C mon, sit down.
I'll deal with this.

Now will you please
go back to your seats.

C'mon, I'll deal with it! Dad!

Shut up a moment Paul,
will you please?

Try turning again!

Why?

Just try turning again, will you?

That compass doesn't work.

Look, we're almost out of petrol.

I think you should
stop the bus.

It'll be okay.
It II be okay. Look.

What the hell is that?

Can you come with me and help me
fill up the tank, please?

Shit!

Those bloody idiots!

What the fuck do we do now?

I don't know.

You don't know? What do
you mean you don't know?

You've gotta have some kind of
instructions on what to do if.. .

something like this happens!

You've gotta have some kind of
emergency plan for Christ s sake.

I'm sorry.

Let s go over to one of those
houses and see if anyone's there.

What in the hell s he doing?

He's wetting himself
I would imagine.

The jerricans are empty !

This blasted developing country!
What?

And that idiot thinks
he can find somebody !

He's met someone!

C'mon, c mon, let s help him!

Ray.

Hey, should I wake
this guy or...?

Yes.

Hi.

What's happened?

Well, we.. .um...we went off
course a bit, but now they...

found a guy and gas and they're
just filling up the tank so.

Gas?

Yeah.

Careful of your back.

Okay, one...two. ..three!

You can't drive on that stuff.

Why not?

It s kerosene!

Most buses can manage fine on it.

Alright, everybody
back on the bus!

Avoid panicking, never panic!
That's the thing. That's the trick.

Keep a clear head.
Know what I mean?

C mon!

Oh my God!

C mon!

You can't just drag me
and my family out into...

the middle of the fucking desert,

and leave me with a bunch of
strangers, do you understand?

Driver, driver, try it again,
will you?

Where are you going?

Don't you run away
you fucking idiot!

Leave him alone.

Don't you fucking touch me.

Okay, okay, okay.
Let's just calm down. ..

we're going to find a phone
and we'll call for help.

There's no telephone here.

Well, yea, but I m sure
somebody's got a cell phone!

No, but you can't get a signal
out here, you moron!

Who are you calling a moron,
you fat fuck!

Oh, shut your face.

Excuse me, this is
a no smoking bus...Ray!

Why are you calling me a moron
because I have a fucking idea?

Paul, Paul. ..sit down,
would you?

May I have your attention please?

We might as well face it.

We're going to be here
some time.

Well, I can't.
I have to get home.

Yes, well that won't be
right away.

But. ..someone must come along!
What about him?

His name is Kanana.
Don't count on him.

He's lived out here ever since
the Germans closed the mine.

We can't count on anyone just
coming along either.

There hasn't been any traffic
through here for years.

I don't want to be here.

I have to get home.
I have appointments...

Someone must be looking for us.

Look,

I think we've driven at least
500 miles in the wrong direction...

We've got to get going right
away! Let s leave right now!

Let's go!

Well, be my guest! It s about
150 miles to the nearest village.

Well, we've gotta do something!
We have to walk!

If I m not home within 25 hours,

you have no idea
what s going to happen.. .

Shut up!

And sit down!

Sir, we can't just sit here
and do nothing.

You know. Can't somebody
go and get some help?

Well, there is a small village
about 35 degrees east of here.

It's in that direction.

I'd like to go! I'll go!

No fucking chance!

You couldn't find your way
out of a public toilet!

It should take me
about 4 or 5 days.

Sir, you can't go, you can't.
We need you here, uh, Mr. ...

My name is Jack.

We need you here.

Look I'm the only one
who stands a chance out there.

Well, what about us?

Excuse me madam,
do you understand this?

Excuse me?

This is a serious situation!

Am I right?
This is a serious situation.

Oh, it's deadly serious.

There are five rules
for surviving in the desert.

We get water,

gather food reserves,

build a shelter,

remain visible,

and keep our spirits up!

At night, dew f alls and
that s going to save us.

The dew will form on the roofs.

We're going to have to rig up
some sort of containers.. .

and catch every last drop of it.

That ought to ensure enough
drinking water for everyone.

With regard to food,

there are some old boxes
behind Kanana's house.

They're filled with these.

Carrots.

But it s important
that you don't eat the dented ones.

They could be poisonous.

Now, shelter.

I can tell you that it gets
extremely cold out here at night,

so I recommend
that you each pick a house.

There are plenty to choose from.

It may be that a plane
may fly overhead.

So I suggest that we pull off
one of the wing mirrors off the bus,

and use it to signal to them
using the sun.

At night, we remain visible by
having a fire burning constantly.

We're going to have to work out
some sort of rota. ..

so that we have
at least two people...

watching the fire and making
sure that it never goes out.

But above all,

we must stay positive
and keep our spirits up!

You got it?

And in the meantime,

I suggest you find a suitable
spot and dig yourselves a hole.

What for?

Feces!

This is the holiday
I've always dreamed about.

Go out into the middle of
the desert and dig a hole. ..

as long as there's shit,
there's hope.

You know, there's something
I like about that driver.

He knows he's full of shit.

Look at the size of the hole
he's digging!

Hey, these holes are
too close together.

Move them further apart.

Why?

Spread of infection.

Look,

if I'm not back in 5 days,

take the tires off the bus and burn
them up on that ridge somewhere.

Black smoke can be seen
a long way off.

Why don't we do it now then?

You never let all your ammo off
in one go.

Five days.

Five days.

Hey! Charlie boy !

Coming in?
There's plenty of booze left.

Shouldn't you
be looking after the fire?

Henry's happy to watch it
on his own for a while.

Paul needs to relax a bit.

In your own time then.

That's not the way
to dance to this stuff !

How are we supposed to dance
to it then?

You remember the film?

John Travolta
and Olivia Newton John?

Olivia Newton John
wasn't in it.

I'll be John Travolta.

That was Grease!

It s a great film!

That's not Grease.
That's Saturday Night Fever!

Oh yeah, that was
a good film as well!

Caught you!

I caught you.
I saw you looking!

You're just like all the
other guys.. . aren't you Ray,

it s tits and ass isn't it?
Huh?

Ass and tits!

You're just better
at hiding it aren't you?

What is it that really
turns you on? Huh?

C'mon, is it tits
or is it ass?

Tits!

Believe me honey I know
the magnetic power of tits.

Gravity.

Is there anybody?

Pull me up.

Hello my friend!

Hey sexy guy!

Mon amie.

C'mon! Get down
to the funky groove...

Shhh...

Let him work!

Remember, he is a serious man.

Now you come inside and party.

Don't stay out here
all by yourself.

I've never been
much of a dancer.

C'mon...give him a drink.

No thanks.

C'mon.. .

You do as you're told. Okay?

Drink!

A real drink!

Okay, okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay...

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. ..

Out here there is silence.

For days they waited for the man
who walked into the desert.

I don't think they talked about him.

They didn't understand
the desert.

Assholes.

Fucking assholes.

Repairing a roof out here
in dead-mans-land.

It won't be long
before we'll be...

fighting each other
for a drop of water.

Killing for a carrot.

Some fantastic striptease
act of human needs.

Is man no more than this?

It's good old Lear again.

Perfect!

.. .death,

dearth.

menaces.. .

and maledictions against a king.. .

and nobles.

Am I disturbing you?

No, no.

Have you got a book
I can borrow?

I can't sleep.

Yes, but they're in English.

No choice.

Do you know
why it's called a role?

Pardon?

In the theatre. Do you know
why it's called a role?

It must be French.

No. It doesn't have anything
to do with France.

A long time ago, when things
were written by hand.. .

Ex cuse me,
have you got a light?

In order to avoid
having to write a whole play

out several times, each player
was given his own role.

"Space Killers"?

Oh, no, you're reading
the wrong side.

Did you write this Henry?

No.. .I'm paid to read
that stuff. Turn it over.

"I cannot heave my heart
into my mouth."

"I love your Majesty..."

That's Cordelia.

It s Othello?

No. It's Lear.

Are you writing King Lear
by hand?

Well, as much as
I can remember of it.

Or what I think I can remember.

Why not.

Just imagine...

if we could put on King Lear
out here.

In this godforsaken place
with all these lost souls.

They couldn't learn
these things.

Maybe not.

They d probably rather sit
and stare into thin air.

That's okay.

We're on holiday, aren't we?

Oh really?

Actually, I was thinking
that you could play Cordelia?

I II take one of your books,
okay?

What s it like living
with somebody like Paul?

Drive you mad does it?

You should keep yourself
in shape.

I do.

I play a bit of football
now and again.

Where the fuck is Jack?

They re talking about
doing a play out here.

Have you heard that?

Those carrots must be
getting to us, huh?

I mean, what idiot would
want to take part in that?

It s bloody ridiculous.

I will.

Paul, your capacity for
self-degradation is really. ..

quite formidable.

And what about you, Amanda?
Are you going to join in?

I. ..

I'm sorry. What did you say?

I don't think
there are any more parts.

Well, lucky old you.

Don't worry.

I'II make sure there's a
part in the play for you love.

Well, if there aren't
any more parts,

then there's nothing
you can do about it.

Well, if you're not in it,
then neither am I...

Well, I don't want you
to embarrass me...

I'll tell him straight!

Tell who?

Henry!

Good,

that's good.

Now surely some tribal
chieftain will see that.. .

God willing.

You know. I hate party games. ..

and I'm not going to. ..

participate in some
kind of silly group therapy.. .

and I don't care if
everybody's doing it. ..

and I don't care
if only the bugs are watching...

they're going to eat us anyway.. .

Practicing your lines?

No.

That's what I want to
talk to you about.

What?

I mean, the play.

Yeah?

I mean, what s it all about?

Well, it s about a King,
who has two daughters.. .

or maybe it's three,
I'm not really sure.

But anyway,
he has a couple of kids.

And he's old
and he wants to retire...

and he wants to divide
his kingdom between his kids,

so whoever says
they love him the most. ..

gets the biggest share.
That's it.

And you get the chance
to be the evil daughter, right?

Sure.

I get to play the real bitch.

You don't have to worry
you know,

nobody has to f all in love and
everybody gets to die in the end.

Are you too tired?

No. I'm not tired.

How about if it was in French?

You could talk to me in French.

What do you want me to say?

Say...I m French.

And I like to boogie
on down baby !

"I'm French, "

"and I am fed up with you
sticking to my ass. '

That's so excellent.

More!

What?

Tell me a story.

"Once upon a time, '

"an old man was lost
in the desert.'

'After several days, "

' he got so bored he was
ripping his balls off."

' So he got this crazy idea. .. '

"of staging King Lear in the
middle of a shit-hole of a desert. '

' At first, '

"he asked the French chick to be in
because the old retard..."

' got a hard on at the thought
of her tight little ass. '

' Sadly, she turned him down. .. '

'Seeing he'd blown his chances
of screwing the intellectual, "

'he decided to try his luck
with the Yankee bitch."

'The cow's immense joy was
as great as her stupidity."

"Wow! Great! A real play ! "

"And maybe the old dickhead's
idea wasn't so bad, "

'because thanks to
her pretty little ass.. ."

' he'd got to attract
the other guys."

"And there you go! "

What was it about?

It was a fairy tale.

It's beautiful!

I can say they were afraid but
they didn't hold each other.

They began to say words.

Words made them forget.

For a while they went round
and said words...

without talking to each other.

Henry listened.

In two our kingdom, and it's. ..
tis our firm intent.

To share all cares
and business from our Age.

Passing then on to younger
strengths, While we Unburthen'd. ..

crawl toward death.
And now, My daughters,

doth love us most? Goneril,

our eldest-born, speak first.

I love you more than
words can wield the matter.

Beyond what is regarded
rich and rare.

No less than life,
with grace, and. ..

honey, would you quit with
the paper. Please, thank you.

I am opposed to any other joy. ..

which the most precious square
of sense Possesses.

And find. I am alone facilitate
in your love...

Felicitate.

Yeah, sorry.

As much I am alone prefer.. .

as much as child e'er loved,
or father found.

A love that turns all speech
to idle breath.

Beyond all manner of all this
I love You.

Henry, can I sit down?
I m feeling rather poorly.

Yes, of course.
You should have a throne.

Of all these bounds, even
from this line to this,

we are now Lady.

What says our youngest daughter,
our most dear Cordelia?

Nothing, my lord.

Nothing?

Nothing.

Nothing will come of nothing.
Speak again.

Unhappy that I am, I cannot. ..

leave?

have?

It's heave.

heave. ..

Sorry !

Okay. Unhappy that I am,
I cannot heave...

my heart into my mouth.

I love Your majesty
according to my bond.

No more, no less.

I II get him
something to drink.

He must have eaten
one of the bad cans.

Get him out of the sun!

Here!

I need a drink. Now!
Please!

Paul? Have you got
any more brandy?

Get him out of the sun!

Don't just stand there giving
out orders. Come and help!

We've got to get him
to a doctor.

We've got to get him
to a doctor.

We have to do something
you know what I mean?

We can't just sit here and
eat these fucking carrots!

I mean, look at me! Look at me!
I need a wash, you know!

I stink like a pig!
I really need a bath!

What do you want?

Get a grip!

We're all going to fucking die!
Are you insane?

Where the fuck is Jack?

We can't just sit here
and do nothing!

He should not have been away
this long!

He should've been back sooner!

We've got to do something!
We can't just sit around here...

waiting for us all
to end up like that!

What?

I don't fucking know!

What do you want to do?

Walking?

You want to walk?

Yeah, why not?
Jack walked that way,

maybe we should try the other
way. Maybe we're lucky!

I guess it's going to take a while
before we learn this stuff.

I know I'm not.. .
I'm not very good at it.

Oh, I don't know.

I'm not sure
if it's going to work out.

Why?

Poor old Lear has got the DT's,
we haven't got a Gloucester.

What about Charles?

I don't think
Gloucester s much of a golfer.

He probably doesn't want
to do it anyway !

Not sure if any of them do.

I think you're wrong about
people not wanting to do it.

I know, I just. ..

I can't go back to just sitting
around and thinking all day.

All the thoughts that come
into my brain.

What kind of thoughts?

You know the kind.

Is anyone back home
thinking about me?

How's my sister?

Is she really
taking care of Flower Boy?

Flower Boy's my dog.

I mean they probably think
we're dead right?

Do you think we're
going to die out here?

No, no.

How do you know?

I just know.

I would really really
like to do the play.

Do you think
you can learn the lines?

Yes, I promise I can. I can.

Were you really an actor?

A long time ago
when I lived in London.

Where do you live now?

Los Angeles.

Wow! Are you in the movies?

Well, no, not really.
I used to work in the theatre.

Hmmm. I used to work
in the theatre too.

Where?

Oh.

No, no, no, no.

You're going to have to use
your imagination on that one.

Careful now.

No, you're not like that.

Cornflakes...

or is it yogurt with muesli
you eat now?

Do you remember that time we had
to buy a present for your mother,

you got lost in the crowd,
I couldn't find you?

These past days I've been
thinking of you more and more.

I should have done that
a long time ago.

Thoughts out here
the mistakes.

I'm trying to
imagine your life.

What are you doing here?

Your plan failed.

You haven't got a King.

Oh, we'll work something out.

Might even do it myself.

What about Cordelia?

You would be
a wonderful Cordelia!

You'd enjoy that, would you?

You'd be better
than the one you've got now.

Oh, I don't agree.

I think she II be very good.

Hello?

Are you bored?

Yeah.

I always am.

Even at home.

It's not any easier out here.

No.

Quite.

How do you do it?

How do you pass the time?

By keeping a very firm grip
on myself that's how I do it.

You don't want to take part
in the play, huh?

That's well observed.

I just don't understand this urge...
that people have to parade themselves.

Pretending like those Japs who think
they're Sinatra or Elvis Presley.

Women who can't wait
to get on TV. ..

to tell the world they're shagging
their husband's best friend.

It's what makes you happy right?

Happy?

Yeah, happy.

Look, the only reason you're
running about out there is. ..

because you can't think of
anything better to do!

Where's the dignity in that?

Don't you think you can
suck me into this farce!

No, nobody thinks they can.

Do you think I'm blind?

Or do you think I'm stupid?

No.

I've seen you
with those chaps out there.

Don't think you can flash
your pretty little eyes at me.. .

and make me go all gooey.

Still, never say never.

Let's negotiate.
Let's do a deal.

Okay.

But it's payment on delivery.

Yeah? What?

If I m going to do join in
there's got to be one condition.

I get to fuck you.

Fuck you til this madness ends.

Isn't that what you're
supposed to do? I mean,

sacrifice yourself for your art?

I must love you, I
would fain know you better.

Sir, I shall study deserving.

The King is coming.

Alright, very good.

Let's skip my lines
and go straight to Goneril.

Liz.

I love you more than
words can wield the matter.

Beyond what is regarded
rich and rare.

No less than life, with grace,
and health, and honor.

I am opposed to any other joy. ..

that the most precious square
of sense possesses and find.

I am alone.. .felicitate
in your love.

Isn't it your turn, Henry?

Well, yes. ..right. Let's. ..

Let s try something else.

Henry, I think I'm just
a little bit confused...

like, I need to know like who
she is and where she comes from.

Let it be so.

Thy truth then be thy dower.

For, by the sacred radiance
of the sun.

By the mysteries of Hecate
and the night.

By all the operation
of the orbs.

By whom we do exist.
And cease to be.

Here I disclaim
all my paternal care.

Proximity and property of blood...

and as a stranger to my heart
and me. Hold thee from this. ..

forever.

The barbarous cronos...

who makes his generation
dishes to gorge his appetite. ..

shall to my bosom
be a friend, neighbor,

and relative as thou.

My sometime. ..

daughter.

And Kent, come not
between the dragon and his wrath.

I loved her most.. .

and thought to set my rest
on her kind nursery.

Hence and avoid my sight.

So shall my grave be my peace.

It s here.

I take her father s heart
from her.

Yes, well I think
that went very well.

Is that it?

Maybe he's a king and
maybe she's a princess. ..but...

whoever heard of
a daughter that. ..

loved her father and wouldn't
tell him that she loved him.

I mean that doesn't make
any sense.

Least he had a daughter.

What s the point of having a child
if you don't have a life?

God, those eyes.

Oh Gina,

Gina, Gina.

It's like a volcano
going off in my head.

I mean. ..l'm sure you ve
heard this a million times but.. .

I've never felt.. .

I ve never seen such passion.

I just have to touch you
and...whoosh!

But I'm in pretty good shape,
don't you think?

You felt it didn't you
Gina?

Was it good for you?

Yes, yes it was good.

I'm flattered.

I m proud.

Have you been with many women?

Oh, Yes.

Well, you know,

women and women.

But I've never felt like this.

I always knew there was someone...

I always knew
the moment would come.

See, that's why
I kept myself fit.

You know, exercising every
morning before I went to work. ..

and when I came home
I was exercising, then...

it's golf for the weekend
and that sort of thing.

But I always had a target.

I always had a reason
to keep myself fit.

So I was ready!

I don't just mean for fucking.

Love.

I'm in love!

I've always
been ready for love!

Had you not been there father,
these white hairs...

Had you not been there father,
these white hairs...

Is this a face. ..

Is this a face?

Is this a face?

This is a face.

Is this a face?

This is a f ace to.. .

'Tis known to us.

Our preparation stands
in expectation of them.

O dear father, ...

'Tis thy own welf are
that I care about.

For this, great France.

My sad and mourning tears
hath pitied.

Ask thy daughter s blessing.

This is a night.. .

pities neither wise men
nor fools.

I can't hear you.

O nuncle,

court holy-water in a dry house.

He makes me want to puke.

What s the matter now?

Messing about with a tart
like that at his age.

What about this one?
Is this one too dented?

Oh, chuck it away,
don't take a chance.

They re all dented.

No, no,

no, no.

Amanda, you should have checked
these boxes earlier!

What the fuck are we going
to live on?

There's a plane!

There's a plane
for God's sake!

You're not pointing it right.
Give me the mirror.

Give me the mirror !

Paul, let him do it, Paul!

You're not doing it right way!

Give me the mirror !

You're not doing it right!
Give me the mirror !

They ate a bit less every day...

then they said words
the rest of the time.

I don't know if the desert crept
into their heads at night...

but in the day it wasn't there.

Together they said words.

They still didn't say them
to each other.

This is nothing fool!

We're not quite there yet Ray.

The trouble is you're doing it
from the throat,

try taking a deep breath
and then say the line.

This is nothing fool!

Not quite, do it again.

Henry, I really don't think I'm
cut out for this stuff, you know?

No, you'll be fine,
you II be fine,

now just concentrate
on the words.

And forget about the rest of us.

And just take your time.
We've got plenty of time.

All right?

Amanda.

Would you do something for me?
Take this.

Now would you go into
that house over there.

What I need is to hear you
not the fool.. . you.

Just think about
what the fool has to say...

and find your own meaning in it.
All right?

Okay.

Oh my God, what is this place?

It's an ice house.

Well, that's just typical,
isn't it?

Lots of big beefy guys
all working really hard.

Just to keep their women cold.

You know why I brought you here?

Yes.

No, you don't.

I brought you here
to piss my husband off.

I wanted to kick him
in the balls.

None of the old guys would work. ..

and Ray would never
believe that

I'd do the stupid guy
but you're just perfect.

White men don't like
their wives fucking black men!

Think I'm a bitch?

I guess I am a real bitch.

Come on.

You might as well take your reward
cause I ve got mine already.

And nobody s going to believe
a fucking word you say anyway!

C mon.

Turn around.

Turn around.

Get down on your knees.

Get down on your knees.

So this is the way you want it?

On demand?

You fucking bastard!

You don't understand, do you?

Come on.

Where's Ray?

I don't know, where's Amanda?

She II be here in a minute.

Goodnight.

Night.

I think I'll also turn in.

No, sit down.

No, I d rather. ..
No, no.

You can sit down
and talk to me for a minute.

You like women?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Where would we be
without women, hey?

Our lives would be miserable.

I think I'd just fall apart.

I d be down at the pub
all night,

day in, day out,

looking for the one and only.

Have you got a wife?

Yes.

Why are you fucking Liz?

I'm not...

Shut up!

You're sticking your stinking prick
into other people's relationships.

I'm not...

I said, shut up!

Asshole!

Sit...

down!

What has Ray ever done to you?

If you want to fuck our women,

then you've got to fucking fight!

C mon, get up! Fight!

Paul! Let him go!

C mon.

C mon, hit me you poof.

Let him go. Let him go!
Paul!

Paul, get off him!

Paul, get off him!

No! Are you out of
your stupid head?

Are you okay?

Amanda.

Leave us alone!

Amanda!

Amanda!

Shame on you.

You can't just leap about
bashing people senseless.

He was asking for it.

No, he wasn't.

He was.

No. He wasn't.

He was. Amanda,
he was asking for it!

I don't know you anymore.

We don't know each other.

I've always done everything
for you.

No.

You know that! Everything!

Everything you've done
you've done for yourself.

You've never considered me
not for a second.

You don't always get
what you dream of having.

I always knew
that you were nothing special.

But that was okay because
I just wanted a peaceful life.

But the worst thing is,
you yourself.

The ridiculous,

pathetic way your head works.

I never...

I never knew you were a pig!

Stop what you're saying now...

because you don't mean
what you're saying.

Yes, I do.

I do mean what I'm saying.

For once in my life
I m absolutely clear headed...

about what I'm saying.

No, Amanda, don't go,
Amanda, stay.

You can't do this.

Yes, I can.

I II change. I'll change.

I'll change!
I promise I'll change.

I'll change. I'll change!

Don't go!

O nuncle,

court holy- water...

in a dry house is better than
this rain water out of doors.

Good nuncle, in?
Ask thy daughter's blessing.

Here's a night...

pities neither wise men
nor fools.

Are you alright?

Time had passed.

The time it takes.

For a while
I didn't see the big man.

I didn't understand
a word they said.

Nor did they.

I think that Henry understood
what they said.

Okay.

I must change arms at home,
and give the distaff.

Into my husband's hands.

Soon you will hear.

If you dare venture on your own
behalf a mistress' bidding.

Decline your head.

This kiss, if it durst speak.. .

I can do it better,
I can do it better.

Can I do it again?

Yeah, sure. ..

I must give this.

I must change arms at home,

and give the distaff.
Into my husband's hands.

Soon you will hear.

If you dare venture on your own behalf
to do a mistress' bidding.

Wear this.

Decline your head,

this kiss, if it durst speak.. .

Can I try this one more time?

Please?

Well, actually, it's fine
but if you like.. .

Please. Please.

I must change arms at home,

and give the distaff.
Into my husband's hands.

Soon you will hear.

If you dare venture
on your own behalf.

A mistress's bidding.

Wear this.

Spare speech.

This kiss,

conceive and fare thee well.

Ray!

He'll be back.

Ray.

Ray.

Jesus.

What s the matter?
What s the matter?

I can't breathe.

She's got a fever.

She's got a fever.
Help me, help me get her inside.

C'mon, please.

How are you darling?

Would you prefer to be
by yourself?

Yes.

Okay, okay.

I don't want anything from you,
don't you get it?

You're an old letch.

When you touched me
you made me wanna puke.

Your grinning and
sweating all over me.

Please.

Oh.

I thought I was going to
crawl out of my skin.

But you really fell
for it huh?

Yeah, you fell for it.

You're a mean fucking
sonofabitch.

You're smug,

you're not funny,

you're not nice to people.

You look like fucking shit.

Why would I want to go with you?

Do you wanna know why?

You know that smile you have
that's so fucking condescending?

The way you look at people.

The way you judge everybody.

I just...I wanna...

I just wanted to open you up.

Get the fuck out of here.

Get the fuck out of here.

GO!

. ..good Lord, sit here
and rest a while.

I have a journey, sir
shortly to go.

My master calls me,
I must not say no.

.. .hard by, there is a hovel.

Repose...

but there while I
to this hard house.

My master calls me,
I must not say no.

Return and force
this wanting courtesy.

Where's Gina?

Can we talk?

Charles, we have to talk.

I can't.

You'd better get something
on your head.

You can't stay out here.
You ve got to go inside.

C mon.

Shouldn't you be rehearsing?

No.

Not without Cordelia.

Catherine.

Gina?

Look.

Cans.

Look.

He's dead.

He's lying out there.

This little piggy
went to market.

This little piggy
wouldn't talk to me.

And this little piggy went
wee, wee, wee.

All the way home.

This little piggy thought
she was an actress.

And this little piggy was...

was a pig.

OINK OINK!

Shut up, Shut up!

I want to know
what s left of him.

Probably only the skeleton,
wrapped in his clothes.

We have to go out there
and bury him.

This cold night will turn us all
to fools and madmen.

By the laws of war.. .

thou needst not answer
An unknown adversary.

Thou art not vanquished.

But cozen'd and beguiled.

As you have charged me,
I am guilty.

And have done much more.

Let's exchange charity.

It is true.

The wheel has come full circle

Howl,

howl,

howl.

O you are men of stones.

Had I your tongues and eyes,

I d use them so that heaven's
vault should crack?

She's gone forever.

I know when one is dead
and when one lives.

She's dead as earth.

Is this the promis'd end?

From the desert came peace.

They didn't see everything.

I saw it all.

A plague upon you,

murderers, traitors, all!

I might have saved her?

Now she's gone.

Forever.

Cordelia?

Cordelia?

Stay a little.

They are not here.

Now they are gone.
