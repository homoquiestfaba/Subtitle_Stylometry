GIRL:
Ooga-booga. Ooga-booga.
Ooga-booga.

Help, help, help!
I'll get you, ha, ha, ha!

Help!

Samurai, are you okay?

Help.

Protect me.

No, no!

Rahrr!

Are you okay?

Help! Protect me!

Rahrr! Ha, ha, ha!
I will get you!

Ooga-booga. Ooga-booga.
Ooga-booga. Ooga-booga.

Someone help me.
Ahh!

Ooga-booga. Ooga-booga.

Ooga-booga. Ooga-booga.
Ooga-booga. Ooga-boo...

[***]

Oh, no.

Daddy will be so angry.

[***]

What are you doing in here,
Sophia?

Daddy...
What have I told you

about being in this room?

That you're expressly forbidden
to play in here unsupervised,

stupid, slow-witted child.

When will you ever learn?

Please, daddy,
I won't do it again.

Ahh.

How many times have you said
that very same thing to me?

Time after time
you promise not to,

yet you do it anyway.

[BELT CRACKS]
Please, not again!

Hmm.

Perhaps you're right.

You're too stupid to even
understand a good beating.

Well, then we'll make you
realize, hmm?

What would be more...

effective
than a beating?

[***]

FATHER:
What is this supposed to be?

Hmm? A Chinaman?

Or perhaps a samurai?

You don't even know
what a samurai is, do you?

Do you?

Well,

he's not the type of yours to
have for a friend,

that's for certain.
Why, they're nothing but...

thugs, ruffians,

the scourge
of the Japanese people.

Why, if they weren't fortunate
enough to be employed by royalty

they'd be nothing more than...

tramps. Hmm?

Hobos with swords.


Please, daddy,
they're my friends.

My special friends.

Dolls for friends?

Why can't you make any real
friends, huh?

Like a normal child.

[***]

Ahh.

Gather your dolls, my dear.

I have a grand idea
in store for them.

[***]

Deeper, Sophia,
much deeper.

But it's hard.

Hmm. Hard work is the backbone
of true character, my dear.

Now,

get on with it.

But...

Ahh.

Did you think
that I wasn't serious?

That I'd look into your big,
sad eyes and decide that

merely digging the hole
was punishment enough?

That the labor of the task
would teach you

not to disobey me, huh?

Huh?

But they protect me...

But rubbish!
They're nothing but dolls,

worthless dolls.
Proceed.


[***]

Please forgive me.

Oh, for goodness sakes!


Oh, for goodness sakes,
get on with it, girl!

Good for nothing
pieces of junk!


Please, daddy!

Get out!



Sophia!

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Hey, Dad. Check it out.

I won it on eBay.

It's a 1978 antique
Hydroman, mint condition.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
'78 hardly makes it an antique.

You're aging me, Guy.

Are you kidding?

If this thing were
any more ancient,

you'd need carbon dating
to test its authenticity.

Hah. I hope you're not spending
all your money in these things.

It's an investment.

Besides, it's my money.
I earned it at the store.

You said I could spend it.

Yeah.

I guess I did.

Aaah!

Hey, watch it!

Pardon me, your royal
ass-holiness.


He's such a dork.

FATHER:
He'll grow out of you.

What good does that
do me now?

Ugh.

You know how hard it is
for a hottie senior

to have a geek freshman
for a brother?

I have to pretend
I don't know him.

Give him a break.

Is that MAD Magazine in there?

I don't see it.

[***]

Hey, Dad?
Huh?

I was wondering

if you'd be okay if I went out
with the girls later.

You know I've got
that date tonight.

Oh, yeah.

Hot single dad
out on the town.

Who's the lucky lady?

None of your business.

You were supposed
to stay here with Guy.

Oh, come on, Dad.

He may be a geek, but he's old
enough to take care of himself.

He doesn't need
a baby-sitter.

I feel better knowing
where both of you are.

Besides, I need this place
cleaned up tonight.

Cleaned up?
Oh, come on!

Hey, hey, hey.

Your brother is doing the yard.
You do the house.

Oh. Great.

Lincoln freed the slaves,
you know?

I'm glad you've learned
something in school.

[***]

[***]

[***]

Cool.

[***]

Way cool.

[***]

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

What's the password?

It's me, dork.

What do you want?

What's that?

I found it buried
out in the backyard.

Isn't it cool?

Yeah,
if you like garbage.

I bet it's worth
a lot of money.

About as much
as these stupid dolls.

They're called action figures.

Not too gay.

What do you want, anyway?

Look, if Dad's gonna
torture me

by leaving us together
in the house tonight,

you're gonna
help me clean up.

Sorry, Princess Beatch,

but the genie
won't grant that wish.

I already did the yard.

Well, you're gonna help me,
all right.

And if you don't,

I'll reveal your little secret
to Dad.

What secret?

Yuck! Help with the cleanup,
or that goes straight to Dad.

You won't tell him.

Oh, yeah?
What's stopping me?

'Cause if you do,
I might just have to tell him

about your little baggie of...

herbs, hidden
in your closet.

Or... Maybe the diary
you keep of your lover boy Tom,

and the list of things
you wanna do with him.

Some of which I think are
illegal in over 40 states.

You perv! How dare you
go through my stuff!

Let's just call it
a little insurance.

Ohh!

Enjoy your chores, princess.



[***]

DEEDEE:
Hey, Dad.

Are you okay?

Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.

Uh, at least I think I'm okay.

Where did you get this?

I, uh, found it
in the back,

near the old house.

It's cool.

Kitschy.


Sorry.

Uh, no honey.
It's not that.

I, uh... I guess I'm just not
feeling myself lately.

Well, then maybe you shouldn't
go out on your date.


No. I'll go.

Gotta get back out there.
Hmm?

Come on, Dad.
It hasn't been that long.

[***]

There.

All ready to sweep her
off her feet.

What's her name again?

None of your business.

I know, I know.

Well, you look hot, Dad.

I'm sure you'll knock her out,
whoever she is.

There's some dinner
in the fridge.

I got it covered.
And don't let Guy

order any pay per view movies.

I'll keep that little
perv in line.

And if you need to get...
Go!

In touch with me...

[***]


Hey, girl.
It's me.

We're on!

Oh, don't worry about him.

He'll probably be in his room
all night, doing his geek shit.

All right, see you soon.
Goodbye.


[***]

Ultra-cool.

[MURMURING INDISTINCTLY]

[DOORBELL RINGING]

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO]


Hey.

Olivia.

Hola, girl.
I brought the champagne.

[ALL CHUCKLE]

Hey, Terri.
Hi, Deedee

Thanks for inviting me.

It's all good.
Come on in.

This'll be cool
Just a girl's night out.

Well, I might have said
something to one of the guys.

You didn't.

What can I say, hon.

I am a sensual animal.

Didn't Dad say you couldn't
have guests over?

It's no biggie, Guy.

How about we make a deal?
Leave us alone down here tonight

and I won't say anything

next time you wanna have
your friends over.

Yeah, geek. Why don't you go
upstairs and play?

Oh. It's nice to see you too,
Olivia.

You know, I finally
figured out

the difference between you
and the Eiffel Tower.

Oh, yeah? What's that?

Some guys haven't been
up the Eiffel Tower.

You're very funny,
dork shit.

I'd punch you up, but I don't
wanna ruin my nails.

This is a $200 manicure.

Ooh. I'm so impressed.

Come on, guys. Let's go.

How are you doing, Guy?

Okay.

Getting any new
action figures lately?

I scored a Hydroman on eBay.

Cool.

Isn't he the one
that can turn into water?

Wow.

I'm surprised you know that.

A girl's gotta keep up
with her superheroes.

[***]

You won't tell your dad about
our little party, will you?

No.

It's cool.

Thanks.


[***]

Good champagne.

Who needs more?

God, you drink fast.

Oh!

[ALL LAUGH]

Watch the bag.
Be careful.

No, I've got...
I'm fine.

Here, just,
just a bit.

Okay.

[ALL CHUCKLE]

Thanks, Liv.

"This is a $200 manicure."

God, could she be
any more of a bitch?


Unbelievable.

[***]

Terri, though,

she's hot.

I can't believe she knows
who Hydroman is.

And she calls them
action figures.

That is one cool chick.

GHOSTLY WHISPERS:
Guy. Guy, over here.

[***]

Hello.

Look here.
It's the geek.

[MUFFLED SPEECH]

Let me talk.

Is your sister home?

You guys can't just
bust in here!

Shut up, geek!

We're not busting in, we're just
crashing a little party.

We'll see what the cops
have to say about that.

Ah, you're looking
for trouble.


Great.

Might as well just add
kidnapping to the charges.

You're such a fucking fag.

Guy,

nothing to be
concerned about.

Just here to see the girls.

It's no big thing.

Well.

Maybe one big thing.

See, we're on a search
for some prime-time poontang.

Primo gash.
You probably wouldn't know

what that is.

You're still whacking off
with your gay boy magazines.

Give him a break, Rich.
Shit, you know how many times

I've stuffed this freshman
in a locker at school?

I'm going for a record.

Next week,

maybe I'll stuff your head
in a toilet.

How about that?

Toilet, huh?

That explains the mouthwash.


Did you hear that?

He's being a smartass.

I hate smartasses!

Lighten up.

Wait till I get you
back at school, geek.

You think you're safe here
'cause you're in your home turf,

surrounded by dolls.

Like they're gonna
protect you, or something.

[***]

Here's what I think

of smartass faggot geeks.

No!

I'll tie you up,
little asshole.

We're having some fun
downstairs.

You'll have to see it.

Look, I'm gonna come back
for you, Guy, okay?

I'll untie you
before we leave.

Hey, you hear that?
He'll untie you.

Geek.

[***]

[MURMURING INDISTINCTLY]

You jerks.

Should've kicked your asses.

GHOSTLY WHISPERS:
Hello, Guy. Are you listening?

I'm coming to be with you.

What's happening to me?

[***]

[***]

[MURMURING INDISTINCTLY]

[MURMURING INDISTINCTLY]

[GRUNTING, GROANING]

[GIRLS LAUGHING]

Cheers, guys.

[ALL LAUGH]

Mmm. Ugh.
Oh.

I should have bought
two bottles.

Oh.

We'll be okay.


I knew I could
count on you, girl.

No, thanks.

Are you sure?


You hardly drink any bubbly
either. Let your hair down.

It's supposed to be a party.

Guys, I'm cool.

Can I get you anything else?

No, thanks. I'm having
a really great time, Deedee.

Cool.

More for me.


Looks nasty out.


DEEDEE:
Are you okay?

We should have some tunes
to keep the bogeyman away.

You got it.

[GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY,
LAUGHING]


Rich!
God, you buzz.

[ALL LAUGHING]


I thought you liked my body.

Go get a beer,
you horndog.

[DEEDEE CHUCKLES]

TOM: Come on.
DEEDEE: What?

[BOTH LAUGH]

TOM:
I'll be right back.

Ooh.

[BOTH LAUGH]


Hey, Terri. What's up?

What are you doing here, anyway?

I thought this was
a girls-only party.

I've got no problem
with girls-only.

As long as I get to watch.



Hey, Rich.

Hey, Liv.

Why are you wasting your time
with that little girl?

You came here to party,
didn't you?

You know, I'm on the
football team, Liv.

Because you like
football?

Well, yeah, there's that.

But the game is only fun
if there's a challenge.

Competition.

You step on that field

and wonder if you've got what
it takes to beat the other guy.

To beat the challenge.

To get what you want.
You know, the "W".

But what fun would it be
to step on that field

already knowing
you got the game won?

You see, I've been
on your field, honey.

I've plodded from one end zone
to the other.

Where's the challenge in that?

Fucking asshole.
Stick around.

Maybe I'll call you
to the benchlater.

You bitch.

We're coming to be with you.

Come on, Guy.

Guy.

[R & B MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO]

* So many nights
You lay awake *

RICH:
Hey. Get a room.

* You don't know how *



* Wake up in an empty bed *

* Never tells you... *

Hey, Terri.

How about we have
a little fun?

What do you mean?

Oh, I say we take Rich
into the backroom

and really give it to him.

You mean like a threesome?

* I would *

* I would *

Yuck.

I don't mean we really
do it with him,

just let him
think we are.

Give him a big tease,

then leave him high and dry.

Fuck with his head a little.

I don't think so.

Ugh. You're no fun.

You should really have
a more open mind, Terri.

I do have an open mind, Liv.

You should try
closing your legs.


* You need a man
Who will wave the prey *

Hey, where are you going?

Didn't you say
"get a room"?


* I would *

* I would *

[***]

GHOSTLY WHISPERS:
Guy. Get up, Guy.

Don't be afraid.

You're not alone, Guy.

Get up. Get up, Guy.

Boo!


Jerk!

Relax.
I'm just having some fun.

Scaring me out to death?

It's a real blast, isn't it?

Okay. So maybe it wasn't
so funny. I'm sorry.

Aren't you going
to accept my apology?

Apology accepted, all right.
Now, if you don't mind,

I'm trying to clean
this up for Deedee,

so her dad doesn't
freak later.

Let me help up.

Hey, hey, look. I know
I came on too strong earlier.

It was just because
Tom was watching.

I've got a kind
of a reputation

to uphold, you know.

But when you get me
by myself,

I'm actually
a very sensitive guy.

Sensitive? Right.

No, really.

Just give me a chance.
Okay?

Yeah, I'm okay, really.

It's just...
You know...

Some part we haven't...
You know.


We gotta hurry.
Okay.

You've gotta be out of here
before my dad gets home.

I was reading
this article on Cosmo.

And it was talking about ways to
really get a physical relation

off boundaries.
Mm-hm?

Let's see.

You read that in Cosmo?

I'm gonna have
to subscribe.

You're so dirty.

The article said you'd
probably say that.

[HANDCUFFS CLICK]



Just one sec.

All right.
Don't take too long.

Close your eyes.

Okay.

We make a pretty good team.

Yeah, I guess we do.

See, I'm not such a bad guy
after all.

Come on, Rich.
Knock it off.

Let me show you what
a sensitive guy I really am.

You just don't get it,
do you?

Jerk.

Bitch.

Just looking
for one more thing.

How much longer?

Just a sec.

Oh, here it is.

Get ready for a surprise.

Ah!

Tom! No!



What...?

What are you?

Ouch.

Hold on.


Tom. Come, hang in there.
Oh, God.

You, guys!
I need help here!

How are you doing
in here all by yourself?

Getting ripped,
what does it look like?

It's not fun
when you drink alone.

Take it, girl.

Thanks, big boy.

Everybody else seems to be all
having fun, except for us.

So it'll be better
we change that.

Mmm.

So what happened
to the challenge?

Uh?

Your challenge, Terri.
Where did she go?

Oh, she's just
a little bitch, fuck her.

Apparently you didn't
fuck her,

that's why you're playing
grab ass with me.

What...?

I wasn't good enough
for you before,

but now that Terri has left
you high and dry,

suddenly you want me.

What happened to that speech
you gave me earlier?

Forget that,
I was just messing around.

You don't think that
I meant that, did you?

Mmm, you were just joking?

Of course, I have
the hots for you, babe.

Mmm.

I'm nobodies leftovers,
asshole.

Oh, come on, baby.
You can't leave me like this.

Here!

Cut a hole in that.
At least you want some melon.

Come on.

Let's get out of here.

I don't know.
But, Tom.

What the hell
is happening?

What does it look like?
It's a fucking doll.

Where's your cell?
In the library.

Where are the others?

I... I think your brother

Rich is in the kitchen.

Oh, my God.

Uh?

Oh, Rich, wake up!
Why?

Guy, Guy.

Yes, I know.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Listen to Sophia.

Guy, are you in here?

Yeah, I'm here.

Oh, God. Guy.

What happened?
Ugh.

Those jerks,
Tom and Rich...

Ah, say no more.

Didn't you hear me
at the door?

I was calling your name.

No. Must had blacked out
or something.

I'm feeling kind of weird.

Are you okay?
I mean,

this guys didn't hurt you
or anything, did they?

No, really,
I'm okay.

Thanks.

What are you doing
up here anyway?

I just came up
to say "hi", I guess.

Okay. Hi.

What about the party?

Oh, it's some party.

Your sister and Tom
having fun in her room

and Olivia just wants
to get drunk and get laid

and she's not exactly
the discriminating type.

And Rich...
Jerk.

I might already say that.

Yeah, you did.
But it's worth repeating.

[SKY RUMBLES]

Anyway, I thought I'll have
more fun up here with you.

Really?

Yeah. I always thought
you were kind of cool.

Cool?

Olivia is not the only one
who's drunk around here.

Okay, I'm not wasted.

Look, I know you might not be
every girls cup of tea,

but I don't care.

Whenever I run in to you
in the hall at school you...

are so smart and funny.

I don't know. Plus I'm into
some of the same things you are.

Sci-fi, superheroes.

Really?

Oh, Guy, what happened
to your Hydroman?

I give you one guess.

But my samurai is gone.

Samurai?

I found this cool
antique samurai doll

buried out in the backyard,
now it's gone.

Rich probably took it.

No, it happened
after he left.

[THUNDER RUMBLES]

GIRL [WHISPERING]:
It's okay, Guy.

Protect you.

[INDISTINCT WHISPERS]

Guy?

We'll protect you.

Guy, what the heck
is going on?

I think I blacked out again.

You're really starting
to creep me out.

[***]

It's not here.

We must have
drop it somewhere.

Oh, shit.

Alright.
Right, look for it.

It has to be
here somewhere.


[TELEPHONE RINGING]

What the hell?

Okay.
Don't move from here.


Gaga.

Uh!
Uh! It can talk.

Help.


Okay, it's alright.

Okay.
Okay.

Ah.

Gaga.




Ugh!

[NERVOUS LAUGH]

Oh, my God.

Are you okay?
No.

[BREATHS HEAVILY]

Dad, you got to get back
here, please, right now.

[GHOSTLY MOAN]

Guy, did you hear that?

Sound like it was coming
from downstairs.

[***]

Guy?

GIRL [WHISPERING]:
We're here to help you, Guy.

Guy, what's wrong.

Brook.
Don't tell her.

Guy!

Don't hurt me.

Guy, it's me, Terri.

Terri?

Come on, Guy,
snap out of it.

[***]

It happened again.

I know, I can feel
it happening this time.

You didn't know
who I was.

You were talking in
some different voice.

[***]

No!

Ah, no.

TERRI:
Guy, it was moving.

It can't move, it's
just wood and springs.

I've read things like this,

if that spirit is
trying to unhappy you,

it might be
controlling the doll.

I know it sounds weird,
but...

Not no me, it doesn't.

I... I totally believe
in that kind of stuff.

You said you found that
in the backyard.

Ah.

[***]


It sucks.

Some more.

[BAG CREAKING]

Oh, fuck.

[***]


Oh, fuck.


Are you buffed?

You are gourd?


You popped the iron?
Mmm?


You're not Guy's,
are you?

You better not be bugged,
keep you clean,

Stay out of the juice.
What?

Of course, this kind
of juice is okay.

Oh.
I highly recommend it

for a strict, complete
technical reasons.


[SKIN REAPING]

[SCREAMS IN PAIN]

[BLADE CUT]



Help.

Oh. Oh.

Come on, Olivia,
you'll be okay.

That thing was alive.

Did you see
where it went?


Maybe it's by the chair.


[***]


Shit!

[***]






[***]

See? I told you
I heard something.

Come on.

[***]

Guy!

GIRL [WHISPERING]:
It's okay, Guy.

He'll talk to you.
Guy!

He'll protect you.
I'm not Guy.

Then who are you?

Sophia.


It's okay, Sophia,
nobody's gonna hurt you.

He hurt me.

And he hurt my friends.
Here to help you, Guy.

Friends.

[UNSHEATHE SWORD]

Oh.
Ah!

No!

[WIND BLOWS]

No!

Guy, I'll be okay.

I'm sorry.
Couldn't help it.

I know.

[***]

Why the dolls do stop
when I tell them to?

It might not again.

Specially if
the spirit takes over.

So what do we do about it?

Oh.

We're gonna have to put that
doll back where you found it.

We're gonna have
to bury it.

Oh.
Okay.

Oh, Deedee, I'm
gonna die. I'll die.

You're not gonna die.

What if that thing
has rabies?

It can't have rabies,
it's not alive.

But it's moving,
the little fucker baby.

You're not gonna
die, okay?

I am, I just know.
I am, it hurts so much.

You... You'll
be okay, Liv.

Here. Call 911, okay?

Get an ambulance over here.

I'll go get
the first aid kit.

I think that there's
infected in there, okay?

You'll be okay.
Alright.


Hello? Yeah, we need help at...

Oh, God, what was the address?

We... we have people hurt,

a summer debt, we're being
attacked by this killer dolls.

No, this isn't a joke.
You have to hurry.

Hello? Hello?

Shit!

[***]


Ah! Deedee!

Dee.

[BOTH GIRLS SCREAM]

[DEEDEE AND OLIVIA SCREAM]

God!

God.
It's you, guys.

You scared the hell
out of me.

You guys are
a little jumpy.

[BOTH BREATH HEAVILY]

Oh, God!
Liv, your hand.

You guys have no idea what's
been going on down here.

Oh, my God.
It's the dolls.

Rich is dead.

Oh, God.

So is Tom.

Jeez, Dee.

I'm sorry.

[***]

Yeah.

Guys, this is really a sweet
moment of warm sibling support,

but we don't really
have the time.

Olivia, you can really
be a bitch sometimes.

Maybe, but I'm also right.
We got to get out of here.

Aye, she's right.

Let's go.

[***]

Here. Okay.

Wait a minute,
I forgot my purse.

Go get it, Olivia.

[***]

Okay.

[BREATHS HEAVILY]

[***]





Oh, God.

DEEDEE:
Livia.


Oh, my God. What happened?
The doll.

Oh, where is it?
I don't know.

Where is it?
[BREATHS HEAVILY]


You'll be okay.

Did you see where it went?
No.

[***]

Gaga.


You are warned,
ugly baby.

Uh!

Get down.
Ow.

What are you doing?
Down.

Guy!

My name is Sophia.
Ah.

What the hell are you talking
about, are you nuts?

Dee, he's not nuts.

She is.
What?

This whole thing
is fucking crazy.

[***]


Guy. Guy, call them off!

You hurt my friends.

No, we didn't.

You did, with this.

But Guy...

[GLASS BREAKING]

My name is Sophia.

The boys tricked me.

Tried to hurt me.

No. No, Sophia,

the boys were making fun
of Guy, not you.

There is no Guy.

What are you doing?

I'm really not sure.

Listen, Guy.
You can fight her.

No!

GUY:
You can't trick me.

My friends are with me
and no one else.


They protect me.

[***]





[***]

[DOLLS MUMBLING]

Guy, are you okay?

Guy's not here anymore.

Sophia.

[***]

How many times have
I tell you, Sophia,

this room is
off-limits to you?

I'm sorry, Dad.

Stupid, slow child.

When will you ever learn?


Don't, please, Dad.
Not again.

How many times have you said
that very same thing to me?

Don't hurt my friends.

Friends? They're nothing
but worthless dolls.

I'll teach you
to disobey your father.

[***]

Ah!

Oh. Ah!

Get him!


[SCREAMS IN PAIN]


[LESTER SCREAMS]

Dad.

TERRI:
Guy, call them off.

Get him!


Guy!

My name is Sophia.

[***]

I know you're
in there, Guy.

You got to stop this,
they're killing your dad.

He hurt me!
He deserves what he gets!


Guy.

Dad?

Dad... No!
No! Stop!


GUY:
No more!


We got to bury this dolls,

to get them back to where
they came from.

Deedee, go in the living room.
Get some blankets.

Okay.

The backyard.

[***]

You think
this would do it?

Probably put
those spirits to rest?

I hope so.

You were really great
in there.
