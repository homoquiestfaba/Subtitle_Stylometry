Good for you, Pete. Good for you.

<i>Access Hollywood spotlight</i>

<i>Hi, everybody, welcome

<i>Each week, millions of viewers love to watch</i>

<i>Ms Marshall's brainy sexpot character,
Maddy Stark,</i>

<i>alongside Billy Baldwin's
dark and brooding,</i>

<i>hard-to-love lead detective, Hunter Rush. </i>

<i>- And this isn't your jurisdiction.
I just made it my jurisdiction. </i>

<i>Can you say "catfight"?</i>

<i>Off-screen, Sarah cosies up</i>

<i>to her successful composer boyfriend,
Peter Bretter. </i>

<i>He's no household name,</i>

<i>yet Bretter's dark and ominous score has
set the tone for this gruesome juggernaut. </i>

<i>Take a look. </i>

<i>What do you think?</i>

<i>I think it's gonna be hard
for her to re-enter the pageant</i>

<i>without a face. </i>

<i>Looks like the sky's the limit
for this adorable couple. </i>

<i>Anything could happen. </i>

<i> We got to do something
We got to do something</i>

<i>Before Mother Earth gets any more hurt</i>

<i>We got to do something</i>

<i>We leave you tonight with the newest
smash single from Infant Sorrow. </i>

<i>Lead singer and notorious lothario,
Aldous Snow, begs us to change</i>

<i>in his environmental anthem,
We've Got to Do Something. </i>

<i>I hope, for once, we all hear the message.
Good night. </i>

<i>Mr Prime Minister and Mr President
You better see that it's not only me</i>

<i>No, a mob is rising in size
And they've been dying to scream</i>

Hey, baby.

Just working.

Salad.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.

I didn't realise that
you were gonna be back so early.

Great. I'll see you in a bit.

Okay, bye.

<i>It's time to do something</i>

<i>Someone should do something
We got to do something</i>

<i>And that someone is you and you
And you and you</i>

<i>I pray it ain't all lost and gone</i>

<i>I pray we might learn right from wrong</i>

<i>And I pray this broken day
will not last too long</i>

Hey, you got here fast.
I got a surprise for you.

Peter, as you know,

I love you very much.

Are you breaking up with me?

Pete, are you...
I just need a minute.

Okay.

Please don't go.

Why don't you just put on some clothes,
and we can sit down and discuss this.

No. I can't do anything right now.

I'm so sorry, Pete.

I'm in love with you.

Why don't you just
put some clothes on, okay?

I'm not going to go put clothes on.

I know what that means,
if I put clothes on, it's over. Okay?

Excuse me.

Let's talk. Let's talk about him.

I feel...

I've been feeling

for a long time
that we've been growing apart.

We're leading different lives.

Who's the dude?

Who's the dude?
What?

No, that's not what this is about.
There's no one else.

I know what's happening here. I really do.

You've been working so much lately, that we
haven't got to spend much time together,

and you're forgetting
what it's like to be with me.

But maybe, if we just held each other
or something,

you would remember
what it's like to be with me.

No.
Just hold me.

Please. Here we go.

There's someone else.

I'm sorry.

We don't hang out in places like this,
Liz and I.

Why did you take me here?
This place smells like stripper's perfume.

I'm gonna get herpes
just from sitting on this couch.

Sure you okay, bro? Yeah?
Yeah.

Yeah. You don't have to keep asking me.
I'm good.

<i>- You're out!
Thank you so much for this opportunity. </i>

Auf Wiedersehen!
Auf Wiedersehen!

<i>MAN ON T. V..:
Thank you. Thank you all. </i>

<i>
Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

I feel really good. I feel happy.

<i>Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical. </i>

Look, you've been working on it for a while.
It'll help your mind. Be creative.

Think about you.
I think I need to fuck somebody.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You're not my stepbrother any more.
You're a step-stranger.

Why you talking like that?
Brian!

You don't need to put
your P in a V right now.

No, I don't.
I need to B my L on somebody's T's.

That's disgusting.
You don't need to be doing that.

And if anything,
you should leave your P in the V

and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y

and be a normal person.

I'm leaving, man. I'm out of here.

She's fucking somebody.
Okay, Bri? It's all I can think about,

is that she's out there,

and until I do the same thing,
I'm gonna feel like I wanna die.

So just talk to girls with me tonight,
all right?

All right. All right, I'll help you out.
I'll talk to girls with you.

So, Peter, what do you do?

Musician.

<i>He's being modest.
He works on a show called Crime Scene. </i>

Oh, my God!

It is what it is, you know?
No, I love that show.

<i>Wait, Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime
or Crime Scene: Phoenix?</i>

<i>- Scene of the Crime.
Oh, my God! I love that show. </i>

I find you both very sexually attractive.

Let's pump the brakes. Okay?

I think that having sex with either of you

would be a great treat for me.

You are so funny.

I just got out of
a five-and-a-half-year relationship,

so I'm not looking for anything serious.

Just sexual activity.
Let's wrap it up, buddy.

You wanna come home?

I'm sorry, you're cracking me up.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Do you wanna come home?

Stop it, seriously.

That was fun.
Yeah, yeah.

Overall, I think that went really well. Yeah.

I want to have sex with you!

Are you crying?
What? No.

I'm sorry that I'm being so weird now.

No, that's okay.

You've been weird

pretty much the whole time,
so it's not unusual. Okay.

Last night, like some sort of idiot, I had sex
with this woman who I barely even know.

I used a condom, but

I'm really scared that I have an STD, Doc.

Peter, I'm a paediatrician. Have you noticed
you're sitting on a fire truck?

Right.
Little kids running?

Yeah, this is new. I like it.
I'm kind of backed up...

Could you take a look at my penis?

Go ahead. Let me see it.

Sorry.
That's all right. Take it out.

Good.

You barely looked at it.
It's a good-looking dick, Peter.

Beautiful dick.
Do you think maybe while I'm here,

I could get some blood work?
Peter!

Your girlfriend dumped you, right?
Are you hurting? Are you hurt?

Stop it. Stop crying. Use your dick.
Keep fucking. Fuck everything that moves.

Just wear a condom.

Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids. I gotta go, okay?

You want something?
You want a balloon? You want a lolly?

I just came!

Hi.

Hi.

Hi.
Hi.

Hi.

Hi.
Hi.

Okay, do you mind not saying that
over and over again?

You can gag me.

You brought a gag?
And handcuffs.

Do you wanna gag me?

Kind of, now.

What've we got today?

Just a walk and talk at the lab.

<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you. </i>

<i>What've we got here?</i>

<i>The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit. </i>

<i>Ouch!</i>

<i>Can you say "dicksicle"?</i>

<i>Let's do this. </i>

Okay, I'm ready.

<i>The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit. </i>

Just go with the usual stuff, maybe.
Something dark and ominous.

Like losing your penis is a bad thing.

Oh, you want dark and ominous.

Come on, I got Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you. </i>

<i>What've we got here?</i>

Peter! Peter, Jesus Christ!

You're fucking Billy Baldwin, aren't you?

Aren't you?
Pete, Pete, Pete.

Stop staring at me.
Pete!

You know you're not getting paid
for today's session, right?

I'm aware of that.
Fucking asshole.

Peter, it's Brian.

Go away.

Listen, your landlord called me.

Said there's smoke
coming out of your place.

Who, Mr Lopez? 'Cause he's a liar!

He doesn't...

We worry about you, Petey.

Yeah, come on, Peter. Open up the door.

The fire marshal's gonna come in
and bust it down.

You haven't been
out of the house in two weeks.

Why are you so damn strong?

I feel so strong!

Hey, don't walk away from me.
You come close.

Your place is disgusting, Peter.

Hey, don't walk away from me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

What are you burning, man? Come on.

It's everything.

It's everything that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!

Okay, I thought I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not. I'm not fine at all.

Okay, let's just put the picture down.

Put that down. Let's discuss this.

I love her, man.
I know.

Look, Liz and I, we think the world of Sarah.

We think she's great.

Okay, but everything...

I'm just being honest here.

Every time she would come over
to our house,

she always acted,

you know, like a little bitch!

Okay, okay, pump the brakes.

Dating Sarah is not like dating Liz. Okay?

Sarah is better than Liz.

You really wanna have this conversation?

Do you really
wanna have this conversation?

Yes.

She is the mother of my unborn child.
Sorry.

You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

I have no qualms with sticking you.
I will equalize you.

Sorry.
You dick!

I'm just worked up.

You gotta get your shit together, man.

I'm trying to. It's so hard here.

Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

Like, she got me this,

okay, because I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

and the cereal would get stale,

and so one day I came home,
and she had this waiting for me,

because it keeps my cereal fresh.
And now I have the freshest cereal.

Why don't you,
you know what, go on a vacation?

Go to the Alps.

Alps?
Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

I could go to Hawaii.

Sarah was always talking about this place
in Hawaii that was supposed to be nice.

No, don't. I wouldn't go there.

What, I can't go to Hawaii now, because
Sarah Marshall has heard of Hawaii?

Then go to Hawaii. Go to Hawaii.

Do it.

No, no, no, don't destroy the computer.

I'm just deleting these pictures.

Okay, I need them off my computer.

You know what? You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

Well...

If we end up getting back together,
I wanna have a few of them left.

You're crazy.

No, no, please don't delete them.
They have to go. Done, done.

<i>That was hilarious. Aloha!</i>

<i>I'm Sarah Marshall from Crime Scene:
Scene of the crime. </i>

<i>And when I'm not scrubbing for evidence,
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines... </i>

Excuse me! Hi.

<i>... to my favourite destinations. Mahalo. </i>

Hi, can I have another bloody mary, please?

You're still working on that one.

It's just an anticipatory order.

Okay, I'll be right back!

<i>What do you think caused
such excessive bleeding?</i>

<i>He was either stabbed in the aorta
or it was his time of the month. </i>

<i>Aloha!</i>

Check in this way.

Just married?
Yes, how did you guess?

Oh, you've got that magic newlywed dust
all over you.

Oh, my wife.
Oh, my husband.

Oh, my wife.
My husband.

My old ball and chain.

You quit squirming and come here.

What is into you?

Not me, yet.

Here is your room key.
So you're all set. Room 222.

Room key's inside,
and the elevators are to the right.

<i>Mahalo. </i>

Congratulations.

Here you go, sir. Have some POG juice.

Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter, Peter Bretter,

but actually, I don't have a reservation.

I just thought I'd take my chances.

Bold!

We are all booked up,
but we do have the Kapua suite available.

Okay. How much is that?
$6,000 a night.

Wow.
Beautiful views.

I can imagine.
That's a little bit out of my price range.

Sorry.

That's a shame. This is a beautiful

hotel.

<i>Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene. </i>

People are excited that she's here.

She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

I'm sorry, sir.
Right. This is fine, right?

Sir?
It's totally fine. Okay, there she is.

Did she see me? Is she coming over here?
Uh-huh. Yup.

I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt.

Fair enough.
Why don't you try to unbutton it?

Button it back up.

Peter!
Hey.

Hi.
What are you doing here?

Came here to murder you.

Really, what are you doing here?

I have been having a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

But then I came here, and here you are.

I just think that's too crazy to be...

Hello there, you little sex object.

I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen it anywhere?

It's like this one, but, you know,
obviously it's the opposite one.

Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe.
Like this one. It's like this one's fellow.

Sort of the exact opposite, in fact, of that.
Uh-huh.

Not an evil version, but just, you know,

a shoe like this, but for the other foot.
Otherwise, I'd have two right...

Aldous, this is Peter.

Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you, mate. Aldous.

Good to meet you, man.
My ex-boyfriend.

Right. Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very, very famous.

Yeah, I am. I am for my sins.

So are you staying here, as well?

I'm not, as a matter of fact...
I'm sorry.

Excuse me, Mr Bretter, Ms Marshall,

but we were able to book the
Kapua suite for you, sir, for four nights.

You were?
Yes, sir.

Marvellous.
Perfect. Perfect amount of time.

Listen, if you wanna have dinner with us
one of those nights...

Aldous.
... feel very...

No.

That's very gentlemanly of you,
but you two enjoy your trip.

I'll be just fine on my own.

All right, Peter.
The Kapua suite...

Have a good trip, Pete.
I like your shirt. It's colourful.

Bye.
Bye now.

Ta-ta. I was wearing two shoes
this morning, right?

Thank you. Thank you for bailing me out.
I still can't afford that room.

Nobody can.
It's for, like, Oprah or, like, Céline Dion.

Really, it's not a big deal.

So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're not technically a guest,

you have to clean up after yourself.

Otherwise, here is your room key

and enjoy your stay.

Why are you doing this for me?

She's here with some guy already?
Kind of messed up.

Right?
Yeah.

Thank you.
Really, it's not a big deal.

Go enjoy yourself.

Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times, thank you,

you know what I mean...
Go enjoy yourself.

<i>- This is a disaster!
Calm down, man. </i>

<i>Are there other hotels on the island?</i>

Of course there are other hotels,

but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like I'm running away.

Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not following them, are you?

I had a girlfriend, right?

And Liam and Noel Gallagher
both had it off with her right in front of me,

so that's similar.

And that was a bit awkward, actually.

So if you do wanna change hotels,
I quite understand.

No, no, I'm not changing hotels.

Stop following
and just go back to your room, Peter.

<i>- They're gone!
Why are you looking for them?</i>

<i>- I don't know.
You're acting like an idiot. </i>

<i>Run! Get out of there! Go to your room!</i>

<i>- What do you think they're doing?
Peter, go. </i>

Oh, God! Okay, there they are.

<i>- There they are, I see them.
Go back to your room, Peter. </i>

Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

I'm going in.

<i>Go back to your room, Peter.
Are you listening to me?</i>

<i>Peter, go back to your room.
Peter, Peter, Peter... </i>

<i>Hey!</i>

Hey, nice room.

<i>Go!</i>

I am in the Kapua suite.

<i>What are you doing? Sucker!</i>

Have fun.

<i>Listen, you piece of shit!</i>

<i>You're an idiot. Back to your room, Peter.
Peter, back to your room. </i>

Did you enjoy that?

<i>- Did you like what you saw?
That hurt a lot. </i>

But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure I just ruined her day.

<i>You know
how we thought the killer masturbated</i>

<i>before he committed each homicide?</i>

<i>That's the theory. </i>

<i>Take a look at the microscope. </i>

<i>Oh, yeah, looks like where he's going,</i>

<i>he'll need to know how to masturbate. </i>

Oh, God!

<i>- Hello.
Hey, Peter?</i>

<i>- Sarah?
No. </i>

It's Rachel Jansen, from the front desk.

<i>- Hey!
Hey, what's going on up there?</i>

I'm getting complaints
about a woman crying hysterically.

Yeah, you know what, I hear her, too,

and it sounds like
she's having such a hard time.

I think it's coming from the floor above me.

You're on the top floor.

I'll try to keep it down.

<i>- Are you okay?
Yeah, you have a nice night. </i>

<i>Okay. </i>

I would love to sell you some weed, Jeremy,
but I'm at my fucking job right now.

Obviously, because you called me at work,
you know that I'm at my place of work.

So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

I can sell you some weed when I'm done.

<i>Hold on, I gotta call you back.
Mahalo, all right. </i>

Hey, how's it going?
Hey.

I'd just like to grab some dinner, please.

Okay, great. Is your wife gonna meet you?
No.

Your girlfriend?

No, I don't have a girlfriend.

You're just by yourself?
Yeah.

Sucks.

Okay, so just one. Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.

Do you want, like, a magazine
or something?

It's gonna be boring
if you're just sitting by yourself.

I'll be all right. Thank you.

I just would be so depressed.

Yeah.
Here you go.

Thank you.

The best thing is,
you have the greatest table in the house.

Oh, yeah?
That's Aldous Snow right there.

I know. I know, dude. I know.

I'm gonna ask him. I'll ask him politely.
No, please don't, please.

Mate!

Why don't you come over and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.

No, thank you. I need a drink.

Would you guys like a drink?

Well, no, actually, because...

Seven years clean.
That's what this tattoo denotes.

Seven years free from drugs and alcohol.

If I have just one sip of wine,

by the end of the evening,
I'll be, like, rimming waiters for their tips

just to get me hands on a rock.

You know what I mean? Nasty.

I heard that.
Hey, what's up, man?

How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

It's mundane.

It is mundane. It's great, I know.

Will you marry me?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes!

She said yes!
Beautiful.

Congratulations!

I'm so excited! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Peter!

What's up?

Are you doing okay?
Yeah.

Yeah, I'm good.

Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant tell you I was coming?

No.
Did you talk to her?

No, I didn't talk to your assistant.
It's not all about you, you know.

Hawaii is a beautiful place.
People come here, usually not to follow you.

So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

Yeah, I think so. I really like it here.
I feel at home here.

I just love it.

Yeah, you should stay.

I appreciate your consideration.

Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

so thank you for dating him after me.

I appreciate that.
Hmm.

Hope you have a really good time here.
Have a great dinner.

Thank you.

Groupie whore.

Psycho stalker.

You know what? It's vacation.
I think I'll just take a piña colada, please.

Look at this guy.

Look at this guy.

Not us, buddy. Right? Not us.

<i>I'm on Sex and the City.
What's up, Miranda?</i>

I'm Samantha. I have sex with everyone.

Maybe it's a good thing that they're here.

You know what I mean?
Maybe this is a challenge from God

for me to forget her. You know?

Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

I love her show.

When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

What the hell is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

I hear you say that, but it's not that easy.

It's that easy. Promise you it is.

I lived in South Central.

South Central. And I hated it.

That's why I moved to Oahu.

Now I can name you
over 200 different kinds of fish.

No, you can't.
Oh, yes, I can.

Do it.
Yeah, you cannot.

G. Ghost pipefish, grill fish, goaler fish
grouper fish, greenback...

What's the state fish of Hawaii?

Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

Yeah, bitch.
Hey.

You ready?
Yeah, just gonna close up.

Hello, Mr Bretter, Mr Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

She is in bed.

How are things going with the lady?

<i>Not awesome.
She's complicated, like The Da Vinci Code,</i>

you know, but harder to crack.

But life is full of lessons.
You learn something new every day.

Wonder what I'm going to learn tomorrow.

Well.

Good night, sir.
Good night.

Good night, sir.

Off to find the mythical clitoris.

So, Peter, were you able to get
that crying lady out of your room?

'Cause I could send someone up,
if you want.

Oh, you could?
Yeah.

That's very funny. It is.

Well, listen, Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?

I do the music for that programme.

Did I mention that the music rocks?

That's very sweet of you.
That's very sweet of you to say.

You don't have to say that, though.
It's not music.

There's no melody, it's just tones.

Just dark, ominous tones.

"The masturbating dog killer
is on the loose again.

"He'll kill the owner,
but at least the dogs are happy. "

I'm no Aldous Snow, I guess, you know.

<i>
Time to start the music</i>

<i>All gonna light the light</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah, gonna get things started
on The Muppet Show tonight</i>

Whipped cream or berry?
Whipped cream.

Here we are, sir. Have a wonderful breakfast.

What a lovely table, so close to the buffet.

<i>I'm glad you like it. Mahalo. </i>

Good morning, sir.
Can I start you with anything?

Orange juice, coffee?

What about, like, some pineapple juice
with a little bit of rum on the side.

Of course. I like your style. Cocktail guy.

Thank you.
You are welcome.

We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

Honey, I know that,
but you know that I wanted to see...

Hey. Hello there, friend.
Hey.

How are you guys? How was your evening?

Great.
Awesome.

I can't feel anything.
All right.

Does that feel good?
I still can't feel anything.

Okay, 'cause it hurts me.

Would you do that for me?
Yeah.

Yeah.
No, no, no. No.

God put our mouths on our head
for a reason. No!

I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay.

Is everything okay with...
Waffles.

Here you go, sir. Breakfast of champions.
Oh, thank you.

And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

Thank you.

Take it easy.
You, too.

Hi.
Hi.

This is the yoga place, yeah?

Yes. But there's no alcohol allowed
in the studio.

Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

Well, there's no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.

Can I set it down?
Sure.

Cool, thank you.
I like your hat.

Thank you.
Please remove it before class.

Hey, everyone,
why don't you all grab your mats?

<i>Sorry, I recognise you from the cover
of Namaste Magazine. I'm a huge fan. </i>

Thank you. That's so sweet of you to say.

I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do yoga for recognition.

Right, of course you wouldn't.
Then stop being so good at it.

That's very flexible. That's nice.

And, you, I recognise you from your show.
Thank you.

You seem much taller on your show.

I'm not.
No, I know.

Okay, if you just wanna start
by bringing your palms into your chest.

Today we're gonna start with
the Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutation.

Let's take a deep inale in.

Exhale and release the hands.

Inale, arms up to the sky. Continue.

Good, exhale and folding forward.

Strong, strong backs. Good, excellent.

Remember this is not a competition,

although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

Excellent. Perfect form, you two, perfect.

Coming up into downward-facing dog.

Good. It's really important in this pose,

that you arch your back
and keep it flat at the same time.

I feel like those are opposing ideas.

No, they're not, 'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.

Okay.

Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins from this morning.

Come on, lady.
My name is Prana,

and I know that wasn't just juice.

You don't really need any adjusting,
so I'm just gonna do this for myself.

Just to learn from your body,

memorize your body.

Good. Strong legs.
Come on.

Perfect skin and form.

Okay, class, I'd like to now
move into a tripod headstand.

This is more of an advanced pose,

so if you don't feel comfortable
or strong enough,

please feel free to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.

I got it.

All right, so let's all come down to our mats.

Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

If you don't feel comfortable,

there's no shame
in just laying on your mat in child's pose.

Lady, I got it.

Good, so let's prep to come up. Good.

Sir, if you just want to lay down
in child's pose.

Now, you all heard me say,

"If you want to be in child's pose,
that's okay. "

Just in case he gets hurt.
Bring it, bring it.

I don't want you to break your neck.

What's up?
Just relax.

My legs, that's what.

We're doing quiet headstands today.

I'm doing a handstand, motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.

Okay, you know, why don't we just release.

Thank God.

Good, everybody. Good.

Hey.

Are you Chuck?

Oh, man, you know,
they won't change that flyer.

That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian name is Koonu.

Cool, sorry.

No, it's all good.

Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

It means Chuck.

I plugged it into a database.

There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet, you just type in your name,

and it just says it.

What's your name?

I'm Peter.
Peter.

Yeah.
I'm gonna give you a Hawaiian name.

Oh, great.

Pepiopi.

Great.
Pepiopi, looks like you've got a little pain

behind those eyes.

Yeah, maybe a little.

There's really only one cure for that.

What's that?

Weed. You got any?

No.
Well, then let's go surfing.

Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to ignore your instincts.

I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

Don't do anything.

Don't try to surf, don't do it.

The less you do, the more you do.

Let's see you pop up. Pop it up!

That's not it at all.

Do less. Get down. Try less. Do it again.

Pop up.

No, too slow. Do less.

Pop up.

Pop up.

You're doing too much. Do less. Pop down.

Pop up now.

Stop! Get down. Get down there.

Remember, don't do anything.

Nothing. Pop up.

Well, you... No, you gotta do more than that,

'cause you're just laying right out.

It looks like you're boogie-boarding.

Just do it. Feel it. Pop up.

Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna figure it out, out there.

Let's go surfing, come on.

Everybody's learning how, come on and...

<i> The weather outside is weather</i>

How long you lived out here?

Man, I don't know. I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.

Wow, that's so cool.
Yeah.

No, like my cell phone has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.

Right, so it's basically the same thing.

How old are you?
I don't really believe in age or numbers,

you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had to put a number on it,

I guess I'd be 44.

Fuck!

Thanks for taking me out here.

This is the first time I've felt good
in three weeks or so.

You need to get back on that board
is what you need to do.

Yeah?
Hey, here's the deal.

When life gives you lemons,

just say, "Fuck the lemons," and bail.

Yeah. No. You said it, totally.

You gotta just pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,

get back on that board...

Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked by a shark,

are you gonna give up surfing?

Probably, yeah.

Let's go in, all right. Tacos are on me.

Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying to you, Brian?

I'm confused and I don't know what to do.

<i>What's up with that hat?</i>

<i>What are you
in the Buena Vista Social Club?</i>

This is a nice hat.

<i>What member of the Brat Pack are you?</i>

<i>You look like one of those guys
suspected of killing JFK.</i>

That's very funny. That's great.

<i>Tell him to make friends. </i>

<i>You need to get out there
and make some friends, man. </i>

Is Liz there right now?

<i>No, no, she's not in here, buddy. </i>

I just heard her.

<i>She's gone. </i>

Who are you looking at?

<i>What?</i>

Is she still... Hi, Liz.

<i>No. I swear on my mother's grave, it...
Okay, it was Liz. </i>

<i>She wasn't here the entire time. </i>

<i>Go out and meet people.
We meet people all the time... </i>

<i>- All the time on vacation.
Constantly. </i>

I've tried, all right,
there's a couple of dudes here,

but they're kind of weird.

<i>Just be friendly. </i>

<i>Iron your shirt. </i>

<i>Iron your shirt, look sharp. </i>

<i>Even your T-shirts. </i>

There is this girl at the front desk
who's pretty cute.

<i>Oh, yeah. You know what?
Go have another dirty one night stand. </i>

<i>That worked out so well before. </i>

What do you want from me?
You just told me I need to meet people.

<i>Ask her out.
Maybe that's what he needs, is a rebound. </i>

<i>He's had plenty of chances
for rebounds. This isn't... </i>

<i>Can we get on the same team here?</i>

<i>Okay, I'm sorry.
We're on the same team. Sorry. </i>

<i>You should go on a date with this girl. </i>

Well, maybe I'll ask her out then.

<i>- Yes.
My wife says so. </i>

<i>- Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!
Oh, that's neat. </i>

<i>Aloha, bitches!</i>

That's very cool.

They're not Native Americans, Brian.

<i>- Bri...
What are you doing?</i>

<i>- The luha. Is that right?
Oh, yeah. </i>

<i>It's called the hula. </i>

<i>- Luau?
No, hula. </i>

<i>You're doing a luau?</i>

Hey.
Hey.

Peter.
Wow.

You look beautiful.
I mean, that's a beautiful dress.

Thank you.
Yeah.

This'll be fun.

<i>Lei?</i>

May I help you with something else, Peter?

No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

Happy 4th of July!
Thank you.

<i>Aloha!</i>

You done here?
No, actually, I just sat down,

I'm just getting started.
It's delicious, though, thank you.

I'll just go fuck myself.

<i>- Sorry, what?
Mahalo. </i>

Hi, Peter.

Hey. Hey, bro.

Hi.
Hey, all right.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Everybody, can I have your attention
for one second, please.

We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

He is the lead singer
of the band, Infant Sorrow,

one of my favourite musicians of all time.
He's so awesome.

Please, please, let's take...

Let's see if we can get him up here,
Mr Aldous Snow. Please, come on.

Share your gift.

Duty calls and all that.

I'm trying to be incognito, it's weird.
It's like work to me, this is no fun.

Hey! Thank you!

Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

What an eccentric and confident young man.

I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very beautiful woman that's here today.

It's Miss Sarah Marshall, there she is.

Look at her, blimey!

<i> Old as ancient skies</i>

<i>I've had these wandering eyes</i>

<i>but you took me by surprise</i>

<i>when you let me inside you</i>

<i>Inside you</i>

<i>Inside you</i>

This went from 6:00 to midnight.

<i>Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving inside of you</i>

<i>Inside of you</i>

<i>- Inside you
Inside you</i>

<i>I long to be, is it wrong to be</i>

<i>inside of you</i>

<i>Inside of you the restless find their dreams</i>

<i>Inside of you this king has found his queen</i>

Hey.

You're from the breakfast buffet, right?

Yeah.
Whipped cream or berries?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm Peter.

Kemo.
Kemo.

Good to meet you, man.
Good to meet, you, man.

Have a beer.
Thanks. Thank you.

Sarah Marshall.

Yes.

How do you know
I was dating Sarah Marshall?

Dwayne told me. Chuck told me.

Even Rachel told me.

I heard about it from everybody.
You gotta stop talking about it.

<i>It's like The Sopranos. </i>

It's over.

Find a new show.

You need a hug.

Come here.

Oh, thank you.

You're awfully nice.

<i>I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig for tomorrow's luau. </i>

You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind off of things.

Yeah? You don't mind?
No.

I mean, I must say I'm a pretty good cook.

All right!

I can't! Please don't make me do this!

Do it!

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

You can stop crying now.

He's dead already.

I'm not crying.

You should stop crying.

I don't cry. I'm not a baby.

Really?
'Cause you look like a gigantic baby.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean that at all.

Hey.

Listen, would you like to hang out tonight,
like, not in an official hotel function?

Yeah. Totally.

A bunch of us are going to go to this,
like, little beach thing afterwards.

You're totally welcome to come.

Maybe we could go together?

Yeah, whatever.

I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,

I just thought that maybe...

No, listen,
you don't have to make this weird.

You either want to go or you don't.

I would love to.
Okay.

Awesome. Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,

and I'll meet you out front in, like, five?

This is so cool.
You like it?

So what brought you to Hawaii?

A dude.
Of course.

A surfer dude. You know, WCT, top 44.

Totally.

We were together for two years.

Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

Three weeks later,
I caught him cheating on me,

so I moved out, and that's that.

What an asshole.

No, he's just a boy.

You ever think about going back home,
finishing school, or...

No.

No. I work at the hotel,

doesn't really have to be a future in there.

Okay, my turn.

Okay.

So, how do you like
writing music for a TV show?

It's great, you know. People are great.

It's great to have a steady paycheque.
It's... I'm very lucky.

Oh, my God, you hate it.

I fucking hate it so much.

So then, do something about it.

Excuse me.

I'm just saying, if you hate something,
change it.

Don't dwell.
Well, I'm trying.

I'm actually working on a rock opera.

Yeah?
Yeah.

What's your rock opera about?

Dracula.

Yeah, and eternal love, you know.
That's the theme.

But I think the two sort of go hand in hand,
you know?

And I...

I have this vision of doing it with puppets.

I mean, humans also, you know.

Why Dracula?

Because he's a man like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.

And every time he gets close
to a human woman,

he ends up smothering and killing her,

which is a feeling I am familiar with.

What? That's just a joke.

Oh, shit.
What?

My ex. If I run, you run.

Do you understand?
No, I don't understand at all.

Fucking motherfucker! Dipshit!

Rachel, what are you doing?

I thought I told you
to stay back on your island.

Take it easy, just take it easy.

Yeah, you know what?
The deal was over April 9.

Well, the deal's back on, motherfucker.

You ain't the chief in this village.
I'm the chief.

Of the idiots?

Rachel, let me handle this. I know his friend.
Let me handle this, okay?

Go ahead.

Hey, man, you remember me from breakfast?

Oh, yeah, the cocktail guy, that's right.
Yeah.

This ain't the breakfast buffet.
What, you with my girl?

Keeping her warm for me at night, huh?

Hey, what are you doing here?

That's right. Just hit him!

Rachel, we gotta get out of here. Rachel?

You get what you deserve.

Just a boy?
No, that dude was a fucking man.

No, no, no. He's an asshole.
I can't believe I ever dated him.

You went nuts.
Yeah.

You guys are dysfunctional.

<i>You were like one of those girls
from Flavour of Love. </i>

From what?
You were.

"I'll kill you. I'll kill you. "

Okay, I'm gonna go get us another round.

I'll grab it. It's no big deal.

You don't have to dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

You look so hot.

<i>Give me Crime Scene.
Give me dirty Crime Scene girl. </i>

André the Giant, out of the shot, please.

Mutombo, out of the shot, come on.

Did you know that there's a picture
of you flashing,

hanging in the men's room?

Yeah. I hate it so much.

My jackass boyfriend made me do it.

Keoki took it, right there.

And I asked him to take it down,

but he said that it would ruin
the balance of the collage.

Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?

No. No, no, no, he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.

But I have a surprise for you.

Really, what?

We're gonna take a quick break.

Tonight we have a special guest
from the mainland,

singing a song from his Dracula musical,

please welcome to the stage,
Mr Peter Bretter.

Peter!

Yeah! Go get them, tiger!

Please don't.

Peter!

Rachel...
Dracula! Peter!

Get them!

What's up?

Thank you.

You know, I could play something else.

I just think out of context this might be...

Dracula musical!

Thank you.

<i> It's getting kind of hard to believe

Awesome!

Thank you.

Thank you.

So, I had a really, really great time tonight.

Yeah?
Yeah. I mean, it got a little wild.

"A little"? You can say that.
Yeah.

But it was really fun,
and you're so cool, and it was...

Thank you for taking me out.

No, I had a great time. Thank you.

You did?
Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I just... I don't...
I just don't wanna complicate things.

No, of course!
Yeah?

No, no, no. Totally. I totally get that.

I had a great time.
A handshake?

Well, I don't know. Okay.
All right, all right.

All right. Get home safe.
You, too.

Thanks again.
Bye.

<i>
I'm on a hammock with me lady</i>

<i>Watching the sea roll by</i>

<i>Things have been great now</i>

<i>'Cause we're in Hawaii</i>

Hey, guys.

Hey, man. I'm Koonu.

Yeah. No, I remember. I'm Peter.
We took a surf lesson together.

Yeah, you're that guy
that works with Kaiser Permanente.

No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk out on the water.

That's cool.

Okay, can I just say something?

I went on a date tonight with Rachel, right?
That wasn't a date.

She's in customer service, dude.

She took you out for charity.

It was a date, okay? Trust me.
I know a date, and that was a date.

I bet you think strippers like you, too.

That's really not necessary.
It's true.

Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me, it is a nowhere road. I know.

Did you see her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

Who, Greg? I love Greg, man.

I saw him beat up a guy with a starfish.

Okay, that's just ridiculous.
That guy was me.

Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

Come on.

The wife wants me to do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

Let me just say
that if God was a city planner,

he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

We're trying to fuck,
but we're not having fun fucking.

We're just, like...
I'm stabbing her private parts,

and it's not fun, and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...

And then when you're not fucking...

Hey, someone's gotta stop him.
You're the butt of a joke.

Fucking this ring is...

Fuck!

It's gonna be all right.

Hi.

Hi, do you wanna come back to bed?

Sure.

Have fun.

I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes.

Julian, what's up?

Oh.

God.

The show's been cancelled.

That's good, 'cause that's what you wanted.

Yeah. Yeah, it is.

It's just... I guess
I thought we had another year left.

It seems like we did, and... This'll be good,

'cause it's been a long-awaited transition
into film for me.

Don't get me wrong, but it's just...
It's a surprise.

Come on tour with me.

I'll serenade you every night
in front of thousands of women.

I didn't know you were going on tour.

Yeah, I'm going in two weeks.

It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

and it's gonna be a massive tour.

Yeah. I can't come 'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.

Not any more.

You're an unemployed actress, perfect.

You could be the queen of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

The Sorrow Suckers.

Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know why they call them that.

Mr and Mrs Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

The hotel wanted to offer you
some complimentary coconut cake.

It's from the hotel.
It's definitely not from me personally, so...

Yeah, thanks.
Okay, great.

When were you planning on telling me this?

I just told you, then.
Yeah. No, I know.

But telling me now
isn't really the same as telling me.

Well, look, you know,
I've not told you I've got genital herpes,

because it's not inflamed at the moment.

Do you guys want some champagne
with your cake,

or do you want it without your cake?

I don't drink.

All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

I worship you,
and I just wanted to give you my demo.
