My whole
life I've been

running from something,

I just never really knew

what it was,

until now, it just hit me.

I've been running from myself.

Fuck it, I'm tired of running.

Hey Donald!

Donald!

Oh, shit!

Oh shit, you scared the fuck out

Let's go.

Hurry up.
Whose car is this?

It's one of my brothers.

Close the door, let's go.

My granny
always said,

you gotta know where you've been

to know where you're going.

And some things have changed

after the 92 riots,

when South Central separated

from the city of L.A.

to form its own city.

And other things

haven't changed, unfortunately.

Hey!

Hey, bro!

Oh! Hey!

Yeah!

Nigga.

Bro!

My nigga Satin, bro,

what the deal?

My nigga, Snoksie, man,

welcome home, bro.

Oh my God, bro!

I appreciate you coming

to bail me out, my nigga,

that's real solid.

I thought I was finna be
in that motherfucker

for a hot minute, my nigga.

I seen some shit in there, bro.

I seen a nigga

put some peanut butter

on a broom stick

and stick it in
a nigga booty, bro.

I was like, "Oh my God!"

Man, what the fuck

is you talking about?

Nigga, peanut butter
and broom sticks

and booty holes, man.

You was in there
for a day and a half.

I'm pretty sure
you ain't make it past

processing, nigga.

That shit ain't cracking
like that, man.

Hey man,

that was real solid of you

bailing me out and shit, bro,

but your breath stank, my nigga.

I can't believe
you talking to me

with your breath
smelling like that.

The last time I had them

I couldn't kiss
my bitch for weeks.

You sucking all on
your phalanges and shit.

Hey look bro,

first of all,

you sounding ungrateful

as a motherfucker.

And second,

I don't kiss these hoes

in the mouth, bro.

That give them the impression

that I got feelings for them

or some shit like that, man,

and I'm not trying to mislead

none of these bitches, my nigga.

They got enough problems as is.

And third,

you don't owe me
nothing, my nigga.

Yeah, bro?
For now.

But we'll figure all

that shit out later,
my nigga. But...

in the meantime, my nigga,

you think you could, uh...

pull a $20 or something
out your pocket

for a deluxe car wash?

'Cause you got my shit smelling

peanut butter, assholes,

and all the other county jail

flavors, my nigga.

You can't talk with your breathe

smelling like that.

But anyway, start
this motherfucker up.

Get me away from this

systemic oppressionary
peckerwood

persecution bullshit.

Persecution?

Nigga, you the one
who got caught driving

under the influence.

Nigga, I had two beers, bro,

and some Flintstone vitamins
I took with my daughter

to build my amino acids up

to be strong in these
streets, my nigga.

The shit must have, like,

triggered a chemical
imbalance or something.

Anyway,

I'ma get a DA reject.

They looking for real criminals

like your ass, nigga.

You need to take my case

and build your
little rap career up.

A'ight, look,

going to jail ain't
gangster at all, my nigga.

And it definitely ain't
finna to build shit,

you know what I'm saying? But...

nonetheless,

I got your back, my nigga,

on gangsters.

I appreciate that, my nigga.

Now start this
bitch up, my nigga.

I need some
vaginal hugs, my nigga.

Vaginal hugs.

Nigga.

Them broom sticks
and that peanut butter

got you lit, huh?

Yeah whatever, fuck.

That's weak.

All right, now slide
down that alley, we good.

We been good. To the candy house

We been to the ah-ha.

Yeah,

Satin say he got my back,

but who got my front?

A nigga gotta figure out

what's ahead of him

real quick-like.

Oh, morning, mama.

30 years old and
you still sitting in my kitchen

eating Cap 'N Crunch cereal

with your little
wee-wee hanging out.

Boy, some shit don't change.

Mama, that's nasty.

Why you talking about my stuff

like you've seen my thang before

I saw it pre-puberty

and let's just say
that's one thing

your daddy didn't gift you with.

Maybe that's why you messing

with them old Mexican girls now.

Your taquito ain't
built for a sister.

Here you go.

Mama, I love my sisters,

but I'm just on drama

overload right now.

Because between you
and my baby mama,

y'all bring enough grief
to the table for like

two weekends worth of funerals.

Like, Goddamn,
can I breathe?

Listen Donald,

I've been trying to tell you
this for a long time now.

You need to stand
on your own two feet.

Because your mama ain't
gonna be around much longer

to clean up your shit.

Mama, ain't nothing
finna to happen to you.

Quit playing.

I'm serious, boy.

Now, I'm finna to go to work.

Okay?

You need to straighten up,

get yourself a stable job

and follow suit.

You can't seem to keep a job

or a woman.

Mama, I got a job.

I'm just on suspension right now

Plus I'ma ask Ernie T.

if I could process serve for him

on my beach cruiser.

If not, I'ma just get

into the entrepreneur thing.

You know, I - I got...

I got big things popping, mama.

I got apps developing.

You know, niggas love tech shit.

So, why don't you develop

a help a nigga grow
the fuck up app?

Whatever, ma.

They probably already got a app

for that anyway.

Then use it!

Then use that Trade Tech degree

you got hanging up
in the wall in there.

You got way too much

untapped potential, son.

I didn't raise no poop butts.

And your granny,
she didn't come all the way

from Mobile, Alabama

for you to just take up space

in South Central.

We got enough of that

with our young
Black men out here.

Mama, I'ma - I'ma
get the door, mama.

'Scuse me.

What's up with it
big homie, Bosco!

What it is, young pimp?

Bosco,

yeah that's my OG.

He a ex-military vet.

He 'bout a decade older than me,

but he was that nigga
that young niggas like me

looked up to in the hood.

He was like the Michael Jordan
of my generation.

Crazy as fuck.

Led the hood in assaults,

batteries, robberies,

and just about every other

criminal stat known
to make a con.

Word is, he used to carry

a briefcase to high school,

with a clawed
hammer inside of it,

ready to use it on
any nigga that gave him

or any homie he loved problems.

It's ironic that he
eventually became

a carpenter slash handyman.

He is as compassionate
as they come.

But he still has some demons

that he's still dealing with,

and it's said that it stems
from a fucked up incident

during his childhood

or his time in the
Persian Gulf War.

Either way, I got
big love for him.

Some money?

Get that $50 to your mama

and tell her I said thank you.

Oh man, you know
it ain't no thang, bro.

We gotta stick together.

Around here, it ain't
too many of us

left in this neighborhood, man.

The Mexicans done
ran us up outta here.

Nah, we ran ourselves

up outta here, young blood.

Ever since after the riots,

we started giving our shit away.

Always remember,

the strong survive.

But that was real shit, bro.

Real shit though.

But, uh, what's up
with you, though, bro?

Shit, nut.
Nigga had to fuck around

and get his wisdom tooth

pulled with the quickness

and then the county
dropped me from my Medicare.

And check this shit out.
Said 'cause I didn't show up

to my recertification
appointment.

Bullshit.

Hey, 'cause the night before,

I fucked around and got twisted

with Sheila Moe.

Oh! Ooh!

The fuck is you wrappin' now,

Sheila Moe?

Shit, I'ma wrap my
motherfucking lips around this.

Yeah.

Hey, it's better than

that ibuprofen shit they give me

Man, I ain't taking no pills no

You care to partake?
You got a lighter?

Hell yeah.

So far. Let me see.

You know it work.

The OG smoke OG.

Let's get it on, nigga.

Hey, you hear that?

Is it trash day today?

Hell nah.

Oh shit! Hey!

That's the repo man.

Goddamn!

Hey!
Man, fuck! Hey!

Shit!

Fuck! I just got
that motherfucker

out the impound.

Damn!

Fuck that car note, though, man.

I'm tired of that shit.

Damn, bro!

They got yo ass.

Oh my God!

This bitch, bro.

Really gonna need this
motherfucker after this.

Here, nigga.

Since you can't seem to
pay me no child support,

the least you could do is
spend some more time

with your daughter.

Tasha, what, you can't be just

popping up at my mama house

on this ghetto shit.
It's not cool.

And you can't just be ducking

your responsibility.

There ain't nobody
ducking nothing.

I stay with my
daughter all the time.

Well, all the time ain't enough.

And you better not have her

around that Mexican hoe,
I promise you.

Oh my God!

Daddy, what's a hoe?

Ask your mama, baby.

I'm sure she can show you

a good example of one.

And I ain't feeling
that gangsta ass

nigga Mike-Mike around

my daughter either.

Baby, go in the house
and watch some cartoons,

daddy will be in
there in a minute.

Tasha, look we don't gotta fuck

with each other.
I don't gotta like you,

you don't gotta like me,
but we gotta respect each other.

All this poppin' up at my
mama house unannounced shit,

this some ratchet ghetto shit.

I can't fuck with this shit,

for real.
Ratchet?

Nigga, fuck you, okay.

Fuck you and
that little ass-dick.

Fuck yo mama.

How 'bout you fuck your mama
with that little ass-dick,

Broke-ass nigga.
You see...

... this bitch is just ratchet.
What you say you,

you heifer? What you say?
Mama!

Bye, mama.
Mama.

Yo, Oh, God.
Put me down. Put me down!

This is shit all...

Mama, your granddaughter looking

You can't just be out here

chippin' with her.

This is what I'll
be talking about.

Damn!

Put some clothes on, knucklehead

Oh my God!

So, how's that golf stroke
doing, Mayor Taylor?

'Bout as good as that pen stroke

of yours is doing.

I guess you forgot how much

I used to whoop you up and down

that golf course, my friend.

I think your memory
fails you, buddy.

Now ,how are you
supposed to run a city

with so much potential

like South Central

when you can't even remember

the last beating you took.

The last beating I took

was from my mother
in the fifth grade

when I came home
after the street lights came on.

Best believe that's
the last hell

I ever took.

Yeah, well, let's hope
that mythological winning streak

of yours is unwavering

for your upcoming
reelection campaign.

Hey, you just make sure you
have that doggone check ready.

Hey, what's wrong with you?

Why you keep, uh, rubbing

at your chest like that?

Oh, I, uh,
I fucked up and left

my
body wash at home.

Had to use
that damn cheap-ass hotel soap.

And normally I wouldn't
wash my dog

with that brick shit,

but I couldn't show
up to a meeting

with a big time mayor

such as yourself smelling like
Oh, whatever.

the uh lost and found
box at the Y, right?

Damn.

What the fuck do you think

they're over there talking about

I don't know.

You know, politicians are just

professional fertilizer spreader

Some people spread more shit

on their lawn than others.

The fuck do we care?

True, true.

The man wants us
to observe and report,

so I'm gonna sit
here and observe

and report for
a few extra duckets.

Shit, God knows I need 'em.

You know, our priority

is to chase dope and guns,

not some entitled
elitist asshole

who likes waving his dick around

like a 10 inch dick
on a porn set.

But like porn,

this pays very well,

it just doesn't include
any high level of dignity

once the job is done.

But we go on
and get that money shot, dawg.

You know, you have
a very dirty way

of expressing yourself.

And a very dirty habit.

Those things are gonna kill me,
if they don't kill you first.

Oh, well, hopefully
they will before

some South Central
gang member does.

I guess you got a point there.

There's more honor in dying
from tobacco fire than gun fire.

You've enlightened me.

Let's get the fuck out of here.

Bust some heads.

You're sure the council
will approve this?

You got the money.
I got the land.

Three out of five of
the city council seats

are my people

and majority vote rules,

which means your
property development

is in good hands.

Well, when we break ground,
we break bread, brother.

Let's just be ready
to cut that check, colonizer.

I travel with cash, my friend.

Okay.

Oh, hey,

what's the status
on that dispensary?

Yo, word from PD is

they've had trouble maintaining
the added paperwork

to stay in business,
so doesn't look like

they're gonna be
around much longer.

There's also rumors of
possible illegal activity

running through that place.
So, if I were you,

I'd be prepared
to take possession

of that property as well.

All right.

Hello, pussy.

What do you call a man
who kills and steals

from his own people?

Normally, I'd call
him an ambulance,

but in your case,
I call him a traitor.

Ooh!

Your Black ass ain't worth
the ride to the hospital.

Yo punk-ass has committed

the most egregious
and heinous act

a motherfucker could
possibly pull off.

Mm-hmm.

You hear me, motherfucker?

You like molesting
our Black baby girls,

don't you, Dirty Donnie?

Yeah.

You have robbed
the future curator of Black life

of her innocence.

So, from this day forward,
I'm going to impose

a no registered
sex offender policy

for the city of South Central,
starting with you.

Mm-hmm.

You better take that old
fruity tooty bullshit

back out there to
Riverside or some shit.

Oh, yeah,
but that ain't all, pussy.

Oh, yeah, and since
the police don't know

about your latest victim,

we're gonna assure that you

never so much as get aroused
at reminiscing on the thought

of your past indiscretions.

Oh, yeah, we're
going to eliminate

that possibility. Uh-huh.

Unless, of course,
you wanna go back to prison.

You want that? Oh, yeah,

I'm sure we can
arrange that shit.

Mm-hmm.

We can arrange that for you.

Oh, but you know what,
that's a parole violation

and you are a repeat offender.

You know what?

I bet you wouldn't
live past booking

once your jacket hit the wire.

Oh, yeah. Even the
guards at Wasco

would turn a blind eye
to a medieval molly-whopping

on a serial child molester.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, yo, Pipe!

You ready to operate?

Operate?

I wouldn't call a quick,

across the neck an operation.

No. You 'bout to cut
this niggas nuts off.

I'm not touching
a niggas dick, man.

Under no circumstances

or circumcisions.

Well, look, well go get
some tongs or something.

I won't look at you any
differently, my brother.

I promise.

Look at...

You ain't said
nothing about this.

This some primal

cock-a-zulu shit.

Hey man look,
killing this diseased sicko

is too easy.

Come on, bruh.

Do it for the culture.

Slicing nuts

for the culture, huh?

It...

Fuck it.

Boy,

you gonna wish you
was dead after this.

Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

Hey, hey, yo Pipe!

Hey, bring some towels
and uh, a pickle jar

for this nigga's gonads.

Oh yeah.

Ain't no mo' bumping
and grinding

on our babies for you, shithead.

But you know what,

I'ma give you a chance

to apologize to the community

that you betrayed
with your sadistic

and predatory actions.

Go ahead, let me hear it.
Go.

I'm sorry!

Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry!

I'm s...
I'm sorry like a motherfucker.

I am so sorry.

Look, let me go.
I'll be on the first thing

smoking back to the IE.

You will never see me.

I swear to God, you don't
treat people like this!

It ain't gotta be this way.

It ain't gotta be this way.

It don't.

It don't gotta be like this.

Yes, it does.

Oh, yeah.

You made our
babies suffer in silence.

I'm gonna hear
you suffer out loud.

May I suggest some Witch Hazel

and some Cocoa Butter
for your wound.

Sundown!

No, no!

Sundown look,

I used to ride bikes up
and down the street

with your nephew Terry, yeah?

You gonna have to
pull his drawers down.

Shit, ain't nothing but a thing.

No!

Hold him down
so he pushed forward.

No!

No!

No!

I thought I smelt churizo.

Yeah, you know,
maybe I do smell like

your mother's pussy,
being that I'm only 30 minutes

out of it, without so
much as a hoe bath.

You got a towel for Big Jim
and the twins, by the way?

Come on, it's penance time,
puto.

She wants her reparations.

And me, I want...

I want a little quid pro quo
for keeping the G-men

off your ass, Spanky.

You know, the Feds,

they're not as
diplomatic as we are.

You know, if I could only

get my girlfriend to fuck me
as much as you two do.

Nigga, weren't you listening?

He just told you,
she's fatigued

from taking all that

big fat white schlong
in her mouth.

Ain't that right, Artful Dodger?

Yeah.
Fuck you, salt

And Pepper.
No bitch, fuck you.

And you can eat my fat-ass
clit while you at it,

instead of all them damn
carno asado tacos

you be shoving in
your fat-ass mouth.

Miss me with this blah, blah.

Run and get my care package now.

Andale, bitch.

They only run fast when
they're crossing the border.

Make like you're on the
Tijuana track team, Spanky.

Come on,
get my care package.

Arriba!

Fucking sick.

Hoe ass nigga.

Babies delivered.

Shit!

How many babies? Quadruplets?

Fucking twins.

You're short. What's up?

They just cleaned me out.
Y'all were late.

Should have been
out here on CP time.

You're delinquent
on this, Spanky.

When are we getting more?

I'll know in about
a month or so.

Fuck a month or so.

We need more now, so you
get your fat ass on the phone,

you call El Chapo

and you get him to
give me my shit now,

Nigga.
Yeah, well,

it don't work like
that, right, homes.

Why the fuck it work.

You know, maybe it
would work that way

if La Migra came in here

and shut this motherfucker down

and hooked up all
the swim team rejects

you got working here.

Then it would work, wouldn't it?

Well, it wouldn't make
a fucking difference.

So, you two piglets
can throw the spot.

'Cause you ain't getting
nothing else today.

A'ight?

Fuck yo fat ass.

Come on, Chris, go.

Come on.

We got bigger fish to fry.

Damn!

And bring me back
the rest now but then

when you come back
next time, home girl.

Fuck your fat ass.

Yeah, fuck you too.

The last thing you need
is some fucking food.

What, bitch?

Not today.

Check yo little bitch!

Customers of yours?

Something like that.

Anyway, you got that
package ready for me

so I can make that run for you?

Ain't gonna be no run.

Why?

'Cause I ain't got a
fucking package, a'ight?

Hey, you don't gotta be
an asshole, asshole.

Yeah.

Jackie! Spanky!
Come get your eggs.

Hey, where's your brother?

I don't know.
I ain't my brother's keeper.

I got my own things
to worry about.

Mhm. Well,

why don't you worry about eating
since you are eating for two.

Come on, baby.

Sit down. Eat your eggs.

There.

Okay.

Yaya, I don't know why
you worry about us so much.

You should be
worried about yourself.

I mean, you gotta focus on you

now with papa not
being here no more.

You gotta be more
selfish for once.

Well you know,
I guess it's in our blood.

Latina women take
care of their own

and you're gonna
have to do that too.

Even until the grave.

And even take care of
that boyfriend of yours,

even if he is a Black one.

Yaya!

Look, love it or hate it,
you're gonna have to accept it,

because he ain't going nowhere.

Baby, please.

You're a baby mama in training.
Okay?

They always leave
their women and kids.

Whatever.

Okay, not always, but a lot.

You know, don't come at me,
because of my situation,

when you are by
yourself right now.

Look at...
You just need a distraction.

Mijo, come, sit down.
Eat your eggs.

You know I ain't got no
time for no eggs.

What's wrong with you?

You always used to eat my
eggs when you were a kid.

And ask for seconds and
even thirds sometimes.

Mm-hmm.

I got business to handle.

Well, what kind of business?

Come here, let me talk to you.

Hey, so you got some blow?

No, I ain't got nothing for you.

Bullshit!

Come on now,
I know you have something

for your mother.

I see all that stuff
you're pushing.

I'm not stupid.

Hey, hey, hey,
chill out, all right.

I told you I ain't got nothing.

That's my word, all right.

If you don't give it to me,

you know I'm gonna go
find it from somewhere else.

Huh, maybe I'll have Jackie's

mayate boyfriend
hook me up, hmm?

All right. Fuck it then.

Yeah. I thought so.

Respect your mom.

You eating eggs, baby?

Yeah, ma.

I guess paying all the bills

around here ain't
good enough, huh?

Don't blow it all in one day.

I'm out. Later, Jackie.

Hi.

Fuck this nigga at?

You ever meet a punctual
dope dealer before?

No. Just that got me fucked up.

Got us sitting here
looking all hot

with two kilos
of coke in the trunk.

Calm down, cowgirl.

What do we gotta be afraid of?

Huh?

We're motherfucking Johnny Law,

SID, Special
Investigations Division.

Yeah, you right.

I'm the motherfuckin man, now.

I just didn't never done
no shit like this before.

And you know it's for my
mama's kidney transplant, stat.

You know how much it costs
to move a black market

kidney in from the Philippines?

How much?

Quarter of a mil.

$250,000?

Well,

we better start working
a whole lot of overtime quick.

Yeah, well, where the fuck
are we gonna find more product?

Big Paul said he ran out.

I can find it.

I'm itching for
that early retirement.

I've been doing this
for 28 fucking years

and I'm ready to
check into a loony bin.

I should be checking
in at a Bunny Ranch

with a year supply of dick pills

Yeah, well, I just hope
my mama don't check out.

I'll be sitting here
waiting to collect bread

from the unsavory underworld
of South Central.

Oh, shit!
There go that nigga right there.

I can smell the money already
and it's making my dick hard.

This was always a scheme

we fight to drown,
you know what I mean?

How much do you trust him?

Usually, I don't trust no niggas
as far as I can throw 'em.

Especially no street nigga.

Or white niggas
who listen to hip hop.

But this particular nigga,
he's delivered in the past.

So, let's just say,
he on nigga trans-probation.

In that case, I'll have
one hand on my dick

and the other on my gun.

Yeah, you do it.

What's up, cuz?

I mean, Fuzz.

Cut the fucking
theatrics, Mike-Mike.

You old IG gangsta.

Oh, what the fuck?

You thought I wouldn't
see that shit?

Nigga, stop posting

your personal business
on social media.

The fuck wrong with you?

Yo, this nigga all posed up
with his artillery and shit,

with white powdery substance
all over the motherfuckers.

See, I was in the process
of frying some chicken

when I thought about flexing

this brand new
handcrafted pistola

I just purchased.

The white folks be
on YouTube videos

with their artillery
all the time.

I wanna stun on a nigga too.

And the bitches love that shit.
You know how many followers...

Just shut the fuck up.

The fuck wrong with you?

You ain't white.

And the Feds love that shit too.

And you'll be the first
motherfucker to snitch.

Fall fucking back, fuck boy.
Ow!

Stop touching me!
I'll scrub the shit.

Where you get a fucking name
like that, Mike-Mike?

Your mother must've known you
were gonna be a double fuck up.

Look man, did you
motherfuckers come here

to insult me all night

or is you trying to
do some business?

All right, so shut the fuck up.

Where the dough at?

Where the work at?

You fucking peanut-headed

motherfucker, it's cocaine,
not lemonheads.

Get the shit now.

It's in the trunk.

Mine too.
Yeah, well do that shit.

Both of y'all pop
these motherfucking trunks

and bring my motherfucking dough

Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

Hold on up real quick.
Are you sure, partner,

that there's no cameras
nowhere around here?

Not for a mile and a half,
Fig and Adams.

And how do y'all
know all that shit?

We know everything.

Well look man,
I need to get with y'all,

'cause I got this lead
cracking right now.

It's still in the
planning stages.

It's all...
Just shut the fuck up

and break this fucking bread.

Yeah, mother-fuck y'all. Man,

you ain't gotta be
so rude and shit.

You supposed to be a lady, man.

A little kindness
will be appreciated.

For example,

would y'all good folks
please pass me

those fine kilograms of powder
that you got for me.

See how I did that?

Please, please.
I use please.

White folks know that language.

Where y'all get this
shit from anyway?

The fairy coke father.

You sure this is 20 grand?

You can count that

I'm doing you niggas a favor.

Mason, why don't you put
your cock-a-zoid on a leash?

Man, you reek
of Black and Milds

and disappointment.

Easy, yo,

Wait a minute, what the fuck?

To stall this motherfucker out.

Did I just hear...

pure white cane sugar,

and they dropping off
some fucking 20 racks?

What the fuck wrong with you?
Not on my watch.

Nigga, you know
that smoker prices.

Look man, you lucky

Ain't no demand for coke

in the South Central
streets no mo'.

Now, if you get your hands
on some of that meth,

then you holler at me.

'Cause I got a
couple of crackers

in Bakersfield and Fresno

that can't wait to buy
some of that speed in bulk.

Talking about pounds, baby.

They say they drier
than a nun's pussy

out in that motherfucker.

And the tweakers is going nuts.

They need that shit, 9-1-1.

Now, can you apple fritter
motherfuckers handle that?

Handle this.

Hey, yo bitch ass nigga!

You almost burned me, man.

Shut the fuck up.
You can't get any blacker

than you already are,
you cast iron bastard.

Hey, fuck you, white boy.

I'm Greg Mac, the Mac Attack

coming your way.

Keep it right here

on 1580 KDAY,
the sound of South Central.

Satin, where we going, bro?

I gotta get my baby something to

Hey. Heh,

and lunch is on Uncle Bosco.

Anything for Kayla.

And you too, Snooks.

And you, Satin,
nigga you on your own.

How 'bout we go to Tams?

They accept EBT.

And we right over here.

Hell yeah, man.
Tams is fire, man. Ah psht.

That shit ain't
never let me down.

Hey, man, what we

I just gotta handle
some business real quick.

Grab some shit.
We good.

Be right back.

What you
need that for, bro?

Oh, I'll trip right now.

I know
this nigga ain't even

gonna work out.

It ain't even no 24-Hour

Fitnesses in the hood.

I told you not to
trust this nigga, man.

Daddy?

Yes, baby.

I know what I wanted to ask you.

What is an abortion?

Baby, that's grown
folk's conversation.

Where did you even hear
something like that from, baby?

I heard mama and Mike-Mike
talking about it.

She said you and hers talking
about it before I was born.

You see?

Scam, this.

Fucking Tasha, bro.

Shit, I be talking about.

Listen sweetie,

the only thing you need
to be worrying about

is getting good grades
and watching your cartoon,

Care Bears.

Okay?

Is that still on?

This bitch is dumb as fuck.

The fuck does that?

Don't worry about it, man

Here this nigga come, bro.

I don't trust
this nigga, man.

Where's your dumbbell at,

dumbbell?

I used it to
get my shit, nigga.

What shit? Like, you mean from
like, your girl house?

Nah. I'm claiming this property
for the first time.

You want a watch, bro?

You always late anyway, nigga.

Nigga, I'll take
that fucking watch.

Nigga, the fuck
you will, nigga.

I'm about to sell this
motherfucker, nigga.

Nigga, I know you didn't just

flock that house
with my fucking baby

in the car, my nigga.

Stupid ass nigga.

Bro, did you
just flock that house

With my baby...
Yes, my nigga.

Now relax, bro.

I've been sitting back

watching this house
for two weeks, bro.

Ain't nobody in the house.

Everybody at work.

The only motherfuckers
that be on the block

is two old motherfuckers
that probably got cataracts

or some shit like that, bro.

Bro, what about
cameras, my nigga?

They got cameras on
every house nowadays.

Bro, not exactly, bro.

Ain't no cameras on the
houses next door on both ends.

It's just a couple
down the block, bro,

but it's way out
of view, my nigga.

You know what I'm saying?
We good, bro.

Now relax your nerves
and lunch is on me, bro.

Benihanhan.

Fuck Tams.

My nigga, enjoy the fruits
of the labor, bro.

Finna rap about
this shit, my nigga.

We making stories, bro.

Kick back, relax, my nigga.

You know what I'm saying?

Fuck this nigga Bosco, though.

I give Satin the

benefit of the
doubt in our friendship,

'cause we've been knowing
each other since childhood

and he's always looked out

for homies like a homie
is supposed to in the hood.

But as I get older,

sometimes I question
if our principles

and life philosophies

are on the same page.

That gangster shit getting old.

So, what you got
me here for, OG?

And what you taking
my thumper for?

No, it's
a nice thumper too.

But you don't need
no gun up in here.

This the safest
place in the city.

That's why I see
all this ketchup

on the ground right here?

Well, we eat
a lot of french fries

up in here, little homie.

K.P, the reason you're here

is for training

and reprogramming.

Oh yeah? And what?
Yeah.

Well,

conflict resolution for one,

but then let's say
cultural enrichment.

And what I'm getting
out of all of this?

A free pair of Jays?

Nah little nigga.

You get to live

and be a productive
member of society.

Watch your kids grow.

Let them follow suit.

You confusing the
fuck out of me, OG.

But shit, whatever.

Well, if you open up your mind,

your heart will follow.

Hold tight, I got
something for you.

Oh, Pie,
what it do, man?

What it do, man?

Shit, hanging in there, dude.

Hey man, what was
your cousin's name?

The fat-ass who
used to be frying fish

all the time.

Shit, that's vile.
Shamika?

I don't know if
that was her name.

Oh shit. Elizabeth?

Yeah, whatever the...
Hey, hey!

What the fuck this
nigga doing here, man?

Nigga, fuck you, nigga.

Business man's on mines.
Hold on.

It's losses, nigga.

G-Wayne, if you
don't drop that gun

and check that nigga-ish
tribalism shit at the door.

Tuck it, nigga.

I ain't tucking nothing!

Some gangster
shit going down.

Now, I'm sure you know

what my family
business is, right?

Adam's Funeral Home on Central.

Yeah, so the fuck what.

The - So the fuck what?

I'm sure you
are quite familiar

that we were very
successful last year

in how many bodies
we moved through there.

Including a couple
of your cousins.

Now, if you don't
drop that damn gun,

I'mma forget why
I invited both of y'all.

Thank you.

You know, I oughta to beat
the cowboy shit out of you.

If I don't
whoop his ass first.

Nah, nah nah.
Ain't nobody gonna bust

a grape up in here.

That's why I brought you two
dysfunctional negroes here.

I wish you niggas
had half that energy

when y'all was out there
dealing with them white folks.

Or when the ese's is
pushing the line on niggas.

Our brown brothers
ain't the real problem.

And y'all gotta quit this whole
in-house fighting shit.

My generation
fucked up somewhere.

We should've nipped
this shit in the bud

a long time ago.

But we gonna get it straight.

Right here, right now.

So, y'all sit y'all
narrow asses down

and take a seat at the throne,

'cause you're kings.

L.A. Kings.

Class is in session.

All right, Snooks, bro,
don't be taking all day, man.

I gotta go see one of my broads.
I ain't had no...

no cereal in a long time.

You could have
some of our cereal.

Daddy did not eat it all.

Yeah, baby,
you know daddy love his cereal.

Matter of fact, I'm about to
go eat some right quick.

Hey, before you go,

let me know if you
want me to roll,

so I can take care
of that ese brother of hers.

Bosco, I'm just
about to go holler

at my girl right quick, bro.

It ain't that deep.

She said she gotta holler at me

about something she can't
tell me over the phone.

It probably ain't nothing.

Plus her brother ain't even here

He probably out chasing
some trim his self.

Daddy, what's trim?

Oh baby, that just mean
you getting a haircut.

Oh

Oh, serious though.

And to this beautiful,

little beautiful
African princess,

I'll kill for you, baby girl.

Hey, nigga, relax bro.

She don't need to be hearing
that type of language.

Yeah, Bosco.

You know it's all
love and respect, OG,

but I can't be having my baby

exposed to that kind
of lifestyle, you know.

I gotta protect her from that.

And I'mma see to it.

we gotta be able to die
and protect our Black women.

If anybody,

I mean, anybody,

'specially them little
poop butt bastards

at your school mess with you,

I'm coming tipping
over fish tanks,

taking heads off of them cats.

Hey bro, calm
the fuck down, man.

What's wrong with you?
Yeah Bosco,

you gotta kick back, man.

Stall out with all that, man.

Ain't nobody gotta get hurt.

I need to just go in here

and see what my
girl talking about.

Please, just kick back.

Yeah, bro.
Go handle your business.

Man, I got this nigga Bosco, man

You ain't got nobody, nigga.

If there's anybody who
got somebody, it's me!

And Kayla.

Now, you go on you
little vanilla wafer

looking like ass nigga.

And handle your business.

Now, if something crack off,
you hit me on my cell.

Hey, man, y'all watch
my daughter, man.

Y'all chill out.

Bro, you need to relax, man.
You back there tripping.

Man, let me tell you something.

Never fuck with a
broad that got dogs,

especially female dogs.

Man, what is you
talking about, bro?

And why the fuck not?

'Cause when you
break up with 'em,

you going to end up missing
one bitch more than the another.

Trust me on that, my nigga.

Hola, Donald.

What's up, Yaya?
Can I come in?

Yes, yes, you may come
inside.

Uh...

if you choose.

But you know Donald,
life is about choices.

We all have choices to make.

Be wise with your choice.

She ain't slick.

Mom's either trying
to give me some pussy

or set a nigga up.

Either way,
I ain't taking the bait.

She still fine as fuck though.

Damn!

Hey, Snooksie.

What's up, babe?

Come here.

You know you the only one
get away with calling me that.

My mama don't call me that shit.

Speaking of mama's,
take a seat.

Mm, I gotta hear this shit.

Let's go to my room instead.

Coming with me.

Yeah.

That's where it all started.

Come on, babe,
what's up though?

'Cause I can't be in
here long tonight,

my daughter's in the
car with Satin and Bosco.

Well...

you got another baby
cooking in the oven.

Well, you bullshitting.

No, I'm not.

You're gonna be a father again.

When did this happen?

Okay, what do you mean,
when did this happen?

I mean, you have no problem

with going raw and
leaving in from time to time.

And if you need a time exactly,
it's about ten weeks.

Which is two and
a half months, babe.

Babe, I - I didn't
mean it like that.

I'm just saying,
I gotta get my shit together.

Maybe I gotta like,
move out of South Central

and get a fresh start.

We can't forget Kayla though.

No, we won't.

Babe.

Bro, you got the strap out

while my baby in
the car with us, bro?

Bro, I gotta stay burning, bro.
You know where we at.

We ain't even 'posed
to be over here, man.

Enemies come
over here try to trip,

one of them hatin' ass niggas
gonna get chipped, bro.

Man, I'm like Linus.
Nigga, this my blanket.

Man, there he go with
that imaginary thug shit.

Nigga, you ain't even
a real gangster.

You a imaginary thug at best.

You the type of nigga

that go up and shoot some
shit up every three years

and then go run out to Victorver
and lay up, while the real G's

and the real niggas
clean your shit up.

Rap about that, studio gangster.

Man, shut your old
sherm head-ass up, nigga.

Yeah, nigga.
Sherm head ass nigga.

You don't think I know
your secrets, boy?

Hey man, will both of
y'all shut the fuck up

before y'all wake my baby up.
Goddamn!

Nah, fuck this nigga, man

Speaking of babies, man.
I got one on the way, man.

Fuck!

Are you serious?

You got a little enchilada

on the way, boy?

Man, hell yeah.

And I don't know
what the fuck I'mma do.

What you mean?

I mean, shit, man,
I ain't got no bread,

I don't got no car,
I don't got no job right now.

Man, it's all good, bro.
You'll figure this shit out.

No, we gonna
figure this shit out.

I got your back, bro.

Look, man, whatever we do,

we gotta figure
this shit out quick.

For front door.

Hey.

Hey, beautiful.

Why you sitting there like that?

What else should I be doing?
Out fucking around like you?

Whoa.

Ca - Can we not
do that just tonight.

Please, we...

Baby, we - we've been to
counseling and everything.

We've been to
counseling, Randall,

but somehow I think you're
dick didn't make it there.

Look,

there's a lot going on
at city hall right now.

Okay?

You know what it's like
being the mayor of a city

like South Central.

Almost as hard as it is
being the wife of a mayor

of a city like South Central.

Lobbyists wanna
line your pockets.

Every city employee
wants to kiss your ass.

And every sack chasing female

is fighting over who's gonna
suck your dick next.

Whoa, wait.

What's gotten into you tonight?

Not you.

That's been a recurring
theme lately, hasn't it?

Uh-uh.

Remember who you are,
not who people want you to be.

Yeah?

Now that I've gotten
that off my chest,

I feel like I can
sleep better at night.

The question is, can you?

Brandy, you knew
what you signed up for.

Funny,

women w- you - you want

a brother
in the - in the limelight.

When shit gets too bright,

you wanna step in there
and you wanna block his shine.

Yes, I have
to divide my time

between my constituents,
my job, and you.

So, what do you want?

Y - You want 50% of a good man

or you want a 100%
of a bad one?

Let me know.

You add those numbers up and

if you don't like the
math you see, then well,

I wish you well in your search.

I'm just saying.

What the fuck?
What?

What are you just saying?

I'm sorry.

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

Baby,

I love every fiber
of you.

I love everything about you.

You just,
you gotta let me be me, baby.

Hmm.

And I love you too.

I was here before all this shit.

You remember that
if shit ever goes south.

who's gonna be there then, huh?

You got some, uh,

fan mail
on the table.

Shit!

What you up to in here?

Oh, hey, mama.

I'm just updating
your motherboard

and your wireless adapter

and most importantly,
your operating system.

This computer old as hell.

I'm about to take this computer
from the Flintstones

to the Jetsons.

It got, like, sleep apnea.

You know the late
night infomercials?

They ain't got no cure

for this old-ass piece of shi...

I mean, um, I got the
cure right here, mama.

Mm-hmm.

Uh, when you gonna turn
them skills into a paying gig?

Mama, I'm trying.

But Silicon Beach
ain't hiring no niggas.

It's like, the white man,

he just gonna hire another
pink motherfucker,

so they don't jeopardize
the white power structure.

Ain't no niggas got no
tech companies around here.

I'm reading all these brochures

talking about technology
is the present and the future.

They don't got
no niggas in the plan.

It's also a time and era

for an entrepreneur
to thrive in this society.

Let that sink in.

Either way, I hope something

pop off for you real soon.

Me too mama, 'cause

Jackie pregnant.

Goddammit, Donald!

Don't you know how
to use a condom?

They come in like 13 different
brands and different flavors

and colors and shit.

And don't you know
them Mexican girls get pregnant

if you look at them for
more than five minutes.

Mama, you think you
gotta tell me that, mama?

I know.

Every time I try to make

a positive move in
the right direction,

it seem like something
just jump in my way.

Yeah. Well this time,
your peter jumped in the way.

Again.

Is she keeping it?

Hell, what you think, ma?

When's the last time
you seen a Mexican

in a Planned Parenthood ad?

That's why there's
so many of 'em.

Well, I guess I probably
should tell you

that I'm selling this house.

And I'm moving out to Phoenix.

I got a good job
opportunity out there

and I need a change of scenery.

This place

is not good for
Black folks no more,

as I'm sure you already know.

Mama, what am I supposed
to do now, mama?

You're supposed to man up.

Look, Mr. Samir,
I can't afford to pay you

three times the amount
of the rent that I'm already

currently paying you.

Look, I'm sorry.

The decision has been made.

You have three months
to find a new place

to sell you sweet potato pies,
which by the way, are the bomb,

no pun intended.

And by the way, I'll take
a slice with some coffee.

I've been in this
same location since '94.

I fixed your air conditioner,

I fixed all the leaks in
the roof, I replaced the floor.

How could you do this to me?

And how the hell
am I supposed to

find a new location
to move my business

and bring all my
customers with me?

What customers?

Do I look like Stevie Wonder?

Because I don't see
no ribbon in the sky.

This ain't right and
you know it's not right.

These customers.

Hey, uh, Black Panthers,

she'll be with you
in just a minute, huh?

Yeah, well, he'll be
with you right now.

Yeah.

Take a seat, Sami.

That is what Virginia Slim
calls you, right?

Hey, who is this
Virginia Slim you speak of?

I quit smoking in the '70s.

Sit your Figueroa prostitute
patronizing ass down.

And what is this
guy talking about?

I don't love these hoes.

Sit yo' ass down
before I slap the taste

of slurpee juice out your mouth.

Check this out, homie.

We know why you're
raising Brenda's rent.

You're trying to
sell this property

to that group of
Caucasian developers

who's sole intent

is to gentrify this
highly coveted area.

We're here to stop the bleeding
from you blood suckers.

This place is for sale
and I can't stop it.

You will stop it.

We got receipts on you.

Slim keeps great records.

Oh, yeah, remember
it's the tech age. Click.

I'm sure that pretty little wife
of yours that's half your age

won't take too kind to find out
about your patronizing

to them Figueroa slut bags
from Virginia Slim.

Who is this Virginia Slim?

I thought I was donating

to the Sally
Struthers Children's

of African Nations.

Knock it off.

Here's what we're gonna do.

You're gonna renew
Brenda's lease

for two years
and at the end of the lease,

she's gonna have the option

to purchase this
place from you

at fair market value.

Now, taking Brenda's
check to the bank

is a lot cheaper than
that white bitch

taking your dumb
ass to the cleaners.

You dig what I'm saying?

I dig.

Good.

So, what's this for?

That's a reminder.

What happens if you happen
to renege on this deal.

Thank you.

Hey, no problem.

Hey, do you have any of those

slamming sweet
potato pies to go?

Of course I do.

Can I have a slice?

All in the day's work,
right Sun-dizzy?

Yeah, but our work
ain't done yet, bruh.

Oh, yeah. Wha...

Wait, what else we got to do?

Hey, man, we got to tend
to these sweet potato pies.

Right.

Nigga, I was like,
I don't see no more

ghetto superhero work
on my cards for today.

Oh. True, true,

but righting 400 plus
years of wrong

is a tireless job, my brother.

Yeah, I feel you.

Yeah, you know what,
shoot, I'mma need a nap

after grabbing on these joints.

Hey, even us black superheroes

need to rest,

Especially us nigga ones.

The fuck!

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Not here, not here.

Not now.

Weren't you hit, big homie?

No, I'm good.

But, who the fuck was that?

Seemed like some
old random shit.

Nah. Ain't nothing
random around here.

It wasn't no niggas, though.

Shit, how you know that?

No, I seen a little
piece of his skin.

Could be the Mexicans starting
up on them niggas again.

Yeah. Could be.

Could be not.

Mm-hmm.

But one way or another, we
gonna find out who did this shit

Let's get the fuck out of here.

Dropped my god damn pie, man.

Hey, Dee, shit

Oh yeah, my nigga.
Where you gonna eat at?

with me, Bosco.

Meth, nigga?

Man, that shit'll take you down
a dark ass road, my nigga.

That shit'll fuck you up.

That's white people shit, bro.

That shit ain't
for us, my nigga.

I know you love me.

But OG Bosco,

he bought a ticket
a long time ago.

Let me enjoy my trip, man.

That's all I got left.

And - and come on, man.

Lighten the mood up, man.
You fucking with my high.

Listen, I'm OG Bosco.

I'mma be all right.

I got work to do.

I'm functioning, man.
I got this shit.

I'mma be all right.

OG Bosco, nigga.

Player partner.

It's
painful to sit back

and watch Bosco go
through these struggles.

I know there gotta
be something I can do.

Little nigga, you
gonna make me tear up.

Even as
the little homie,

it gotta be something.
Or maybe he just too far gone.

I don't know.

Just add this to
all the other stuff

weighing on me right now.

There gotta be a quick solution
to fix all this shit.

Ernie T.

Gots to
be more careful.

Snooks, or should I say,

inmate 777-93-11.

You know what,

I done told Esther

about leaving that
damn front door open.

You know what?
She gonna mess around

and let one of these janky ass
street negroes come up here

and jack Ernie T.
for his duckets.

When she knows they saw me

go to that versatell
machine this afternoon.

Ernie T, I'll tell you what, you
always about your money, man.

You damn right, boy.

'Cause let me
tell you something,

a man is only as valuable
as his currency.

If you only got
$2 in your pocket,

you just a $2 nigga.

But I digress.

Why you here, boy?
Did you get that check

I sent you in the
mail young blood?

I did get the check,

and you shorted me
on some overtime too.

That wasn't cool, Ernie.

Oh,
man Donald.

Now you know Ernie T.
don't pay no overtime

less you call the labor
board on a nigga.

It's cool, Ernie.

So, we gonna make
a lot more money.

I'm here to get my job back.

Uh, yeah, but I can't
hire no convicts.

You know, my
insurance won't let me

hire legal process servers

with a criminal record.

Ernie, I'm innocent.

I got a DA reject.

You mean the

court system's backed up
and they ain't got time

to deal with yo monkey ass.

I mean, you got over.

Go play the lotto, negro.

You're blessed.

Nah, Ernie, I'm serious.

I just left the DMV.
I'm good over there too.

I'm ready to get my job back.

Look...

the truth is, young blood,
I had to hire somebody

to take over your workload.

I got two new clients,
there was so much business

I had to turn down money,
and you know

how Ernie T.
don't like to miss no dollars.

Ernie, you gave my job away?

To a Mexican fella.

He came in here and he
works for 50% less money

and a 100% less attitude.

Come on Ernie, man,
you know I need this job, man.

Okay, okay.

Okay look,

I'll hire you back, all right.

But you gonna have to take

the same pay Javier
takes, all right,

which is 50% of
your previous rate.

That's the best I can do.

My overhead done went up

since the last
time I was here, man.

Look man, let me know.

Until then, I got to get on

out of here.
I gotta go meet Chuck

over off of Dinka, man.

I gotta get some of
that Viagra, you know?

My old lady, she got a promotion

and later tonight,

she gonna get a little taste
of this party favor.

You know what I mean?

Ernie, I don't gotta
think about it, man.

I really need this job, man.

Okay. Well, cool.

Square bills then, bro.

You know what?

I got something for you.

This just came in tonight.

You gotta serve
that reefer store

over there on Century.

The city is really
after 'em, all right?

It's a high priority,

no pun intended.

Listen, go down there
and play the role.

You know what I mean?
Be a superstar.

Act like you gonna buy
something when you go in there.

And when you buy something,
really buy something.

And bring me a nickel
bag of ooh wee, all right?

Ernie, with the
salary you paying me,

I ain't gonna be able
to afford nothing

besides the nickel
bag of stress weed.

Now see,
that's the attitude

that got your ass
written up the last time.

You know what I'm saying?

Ah, ah... I'm just fucking
with you, Ernie T.

Mm-hmm.

Dry ass sense of humor, man.
Don't let that distract you

from the fact that I'm actually
grateful for the opportunity.

All right, great,
'cause I'm distracted right now,

because you making
me miss my trim.

You're cock blocking.
You hear me? Gotta go.

Make sure you lock up, okay?

I'll lock up.

God damn shit, boy.

I'm trying to get some ass
and here you come

with your bullshit
"I need a job."

Nigga, that shit became
the neediest motherfucker.

How you
gonna hire the Mexicans?

Oh, shit.

The Mexicans are taking over.

They work
and they bring oranges.

That's it.
Right.

And this - all right,
that's - that's 15

and

All right 5, 10.
9.

You want one?

No, I'm good.
I'm good.

It's 15.
Okay.

23. I'm out.
17, 18, 19...

Fuck!

You suck at this.

You - if we were in
Vegas playing against you,

I'd be a rich bitch.
At least a nigga

rich bitch, yeah.

You're gonna be
cracker rich very soon.

Such rude and vulgar language

to be using especially
in the presence

of the house of the Lord, man.

Why we gotta meet here anyway?

Safest place on Earth.

Oh. I guess your cousins

ain't told you about
them church bombings

they doing down south, huh?

Big Brother can't
see us here, boo.

But the Lord can.

I'm an atheist.

You know what?

That don't surprise me at all.

Why you gotta work
with a white boy?

That's my white boy.
Don't worry about it.

Look man, despite
your heathenness

and blasphemous ass ways

and my deep disdain
and hatred for the police,

I'm still gonna
give y'all this blessing.

Nah nigga. What this is,

is your janky ass
need to fuck with our

all powerful asses
to get something you want

for your own personal gain.

And since we incidentally happen

to benefit from it,
go the fuck on.

What the fuck ever,
you rogue fucks.

Now, I know y'all familiar

with that new
dispensary over there

on Century, right?

What about it, shit head?

Hey, man, fuck your mama.

I'm tired of this
dude right here, man.

I swear, man.

Just listen.

Now, I got this
fat bitch, right.

I be using her mouth
from time to time.

She real cool. She a
budtender down at that spot.

She be kushing me down,
necking me down,

like all command, you feel me.

'Til she got fired
for stealing shit, right.

But anyway, last night,
she was just handling my shit.

She was blowing
my shit to oblivion.

She was giving me like
the Olympic rim.

She was just handling
a nigga's shit like real,

She got the little
Nigga, just skip

the dick sucking dramatizations

and get to the real.

You know what, you a hater.

He wanted to hear that shit.

Anyway,

all right, all right, so look.

She told me that
every Tuesday night

at 7:00 PM,
this is cash drop night.

They got one security guard
that worked that day.

Just one.

The other leaves at six o'clock.

Ooh!

Hey!

Ooh!

He oversees
the cash drop

and the dope drop.

That's right, nigga.

Crystal meth.

Ice, ice, nigga.

By the pounds, I'm told.

Now, if you two cowboys

really wanna make
some serious bread,

you go shake down
them equally crooked fucks

and bring me back an ass load
of that premium dope.

All that shit.

Yeah,
you know I need that

for these chalkies up north.
You feel me?

And you sure they moving

that kind of weight
out of that dispensary?

Yeah.
Yeah. I - I'm pretty sure.

Oh, fuck!
Don't be fucking with us,

thug.

Hey, man, ain't nobody got time
to be fucking around, pork chop.

Go home and play
with your sister

if you think I'm playing, fool.

Yeah. I feel like
something funny

was coming up
out of that spot.

Niggas was gonna be illegal
one way or another.

Probably working as distro

for somebody
south of the border.

I don't give a fuck
who they're working for.

It's tax season.

Tax season's in the
summertime too?

You is a stupid motherfucker.

I didn't
even know that,

'cause I ain't never
had taxes, right.

'Cause I get most of my money
under the table, you feel me?

I know how to butter
my bread on the low.

You know what I'm talking about?

I'll be out here...
You ignorant ass nigga.

Tax season is year round
in South Central,

so go get me my cheddar,
you stupid ass hood rat bitch.

Well, I rather be Mighty Mouse
than Porky Pig,

you rampart reject
motherfuckers.

Love these motherfuckers, man.

Hell yeah. That shit's hot.

Nah man. You know,
when I was a kid

and you knock 'em
down in one bite.

Man, look at this shit.

Howdy.

You good folks look
like you're a part

of the neighborhood
watch program.

Yeah.

Something like that.

Okay, um...

we're here for the open house.

House closed.

What do you mean?

We drove all the way from...
Well,

Sounds like

you need to drive
all the way back.

This house is off the market.

Oh. Okay, uh...

guess we're a little too late.

Let's go, honey.

Nope.

Not too late,
just too white.

Courtesy of your neighborhood
negro protection agency.

Motherfuckers.

I'm tired of these things, man.

See, that's more like it.

How are you, my
Nubian brother and sister?

Uh, good, and yourself?

Even better if we
could come on in

and see this house.

Oh, well, absolutely.

Absolutely.
And just so you know,

the owner,
very eager to sell.

Wow, that's pretty encouraging.

To somebody like you.

Man, God damn!
Is you ready, nigga?

Yeah, nigga, I'm ready.

I can't believe we finna hear
this genius at work.

Hey, this my nigga.

Man, at least I got
aspirations, motherfucker.

The fuck you aspire to do?

Nigga, I aspire to fuck
with you, you dummy.

Now, that's a dangerous
job, motherfucker.

Say man,
time is money, man.

And judging from the looks
of y'all impoverished faces,

ain't none of y'all
niggas got enough,

so let's get to it, man.

Look, just make sure you got me
sounding right, homeboy.

Nah, you make sure you
sound all right, homeboy.

Yeah, all right. Let's go

All right,

From the top.

Ooh! Man,

And look at him.

RadioShack equipment, man.

Man, y'all unappreciative

Man, that don't

Hey, man, hell yeah, man.
You ain't the only one, nigga.

I got another fucking baby
on the way, nigga.

My job ain't about shit, nigga.
And my dream job,

around the bitch.

Man, we gotta hit a lick, bro.

Not no petty Eddie
smalltime shit, neither.

Nigga, I'm down to hit a bank.

A bank?

Man, you sound just like

one of them old ass
niggas from the '90s.

Man, ain't nobody
hitting banks no more.

It's a one way trip
to the Feds, bro.

You still hitting that pipe?

'Cause your idea's sounding

just like you,
bullshit.

Bro Bosco, chill, bro.

The nigga might be
half right this time, bro.

Yeah, I'm right. The OG Bosco,
nigga. What you talk about

Little homie?
Yeah, all right.

Nah, real nigga shit, bro.

I know that dispensary

That motherfucker got

I slid through there last week
and peeped the whole thing.

They got meth, crack, powder,

Big racks in the back.

I seen everything, bro.

Oh shit, man.
I shouldn't be hearing

Unless y'all finna

without me having
to get my hands dirty,

I am not fuck with y'all, bro.

Man, shut your
delicate ass up, man.

Hey, I think I know those folks

You know them folks, man
Fuck them and fuck you too, bro.

and that's on gangsters, nigga.

Bosco, nigga.

Hey, hey, hey.

Disclaimer though,

Bosco, I'm with the nigga Tone
on the lookout position, bro.

You two motherfuckers

and I can't do it my, nigga.

My pop's doing two dimes

and I'll be damned

them same footsteps, my nigga.

Man, I knew you

And don't you still

Three stacks.

From that non-refundable
bond fee.

Yeah, remember that, right?

But look my nigga,

With all the shit that they

But if you not

and let the real
niggas go guerilla

in that motherfucker,
while you direct traffic.

But go on and spy
on the situation,

my nigga.

Anyway bro,

I slid down there last week.

I was supposed to serve them
they business papers.

Obviously the city
is on them negroes, bro.

They popping.

But I couldn't serve
'em the papers,

'cause they had some big ass

goodfellow meeting in the back.

That's when I seen
it all go down, bro.

Hundreds of thousands
of dollars, my nigga.

Real shit.

Big dope.

Damn!

Who would've known
them ugly ass niggas

was getting it like that.

We 'bout it?

Hey, hey, for real, bro.

I ain't never been on
no hardcore gangster shit

like you niggas, bro.

But right now,
I'm thirsty, my nigga.

Desperate time's call for
desperate measures, my nigga.

And I need this, my nigga.

Are you niggas with this shit?

Hell yeah.

Fo' sure.
Man, you make sure

for this, homeboy.

Nigga, I'm good.

Tone,

Hell no, I ain't with it, man.

I ain't on no Tupac shit

I'll pray for y'all though.

Yeah, I knew you was
a scary fat ass nigga.

Hey man, fuck all
y'all niggas, man.

If y'all get caught,
I don't know nothing,

but if y'all get away with it,
just remember who was there

with y'all niggas in spirit.
You feel me?

Oh fuck! Oh!

Ooh, God damn.

Ah, shit!

Oh!

Damn, Alesia.

Every time I...

try to wean myself off
that good, good,

you just come back in here

and throw that shit
on my weak ass.

Fuck!

I knew I should have hired
your ugly ass cousin Tameka.

You knew what you were doing,

'cause I was always the best

candidate for the job.

Can nobody take dick-

-tation like me.

But remember,

too much of anything
can be dangerous.

Speaking of that, we need to
change the dress code

around here, okay.

This shit is hazardous
for my marriage,

my whole sanity.

Look, don't you have
any like turtlenecks,

a - any rompers in
your wardrobe anywhere?

Come on, try to help me out.

Mm, but it's July
in South Central.

Okay, but I - I need
you to dress

like it's December in Chicago.

Can you maybe do that for me?

Please, try.

I'll do my best.

Thank you.

But is there anything

else that you need me to do?

Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope.

Hey, Alesia, I'm good.

Now I - I appreciate you.

I appreciate.

Okay.
Okay, I think

I appreciate everything
you do around here.

All right? Um...

How 'bout you...um...

Won't you go and take,

like, a long lunch. Okay?

You know, take your time.

And um,

yeah, I'm just gonna
focus on some work here.

There you go.

Um, I'll focus on the work here

Just alone.
Okay.

That'd be good for me.

Ah!

Fuck!

Ah, shit!

I said
alone,

Alesia.

What's
the matter, Randall?

You too busy serving your secret

that you can't serve the people?

Man, it ain't even lunch time

and your secretary

is two buttons
down on her shirt.

One way or the other,

she's sucking at her job, huh?

Do you even have
an appointment?

You can't just be barging

into the mayor's office.

Come on, Randall,
you ain't no real leader.

You just another elected
opportunist, like the rest of

those power
hungry cracker fucks.

Thank you, Frederick Douglass.

How about you sit down and
just state your business, Jack.

No, that's okay.
I'll stand.

I don't wanna
stoop to your level.

Well, do your thing, negro.

Cutting to the chase.

So I'm gonna assume

that you are in receipt

of those photography elements

sent to your residence.

That's you?

You sent a fucking bullet

to my house?

You got a little nasty ass habit

of sticking your big ass nose

where it don't belong, Ron.

Well, if it goes down

in the city of South Central,

this big ass nose,

is gonna find it,

just like it found
your greasy ass palms

dipping into that
cock-a-zoid cookie jar.

Yeah, I thought that take some
of the bass out your voice.

You was bubbling up on me

like a fried bologna sandwich

a second ago.

All right, so...

so get on with it, Sundown.

Or is it Shakedown today?

You know what?
That's funny, motherfucker,

coming from a nigga
who on a take.

You ain't finna to sell out

the city on my watch, bruh.

It ain't even like that.
You got the whole damn thing

turned around, man.

Man, you must think I got off

a Greyhound from
Little Rock yesterday.

Check this out, partner.

That white boy you've
been meetin' with

is not a lobbyist.

He's a Fed.

And he's a threat to you

and the city.

And we must
eliminate that threat.

Barnett, the guy I golf with

is a Fed?

That's right.

An official sitting by
the federal government.

Shi...
Yes.

Come on, man.

Listen, South Central

is the main artery
of Los Angeles.

It runs through the
middle of everything.

Minutes from Hollywood

to beaches downtown.

This is a geographical
prime location.

And them honkeys want it.

Now, they done stole
the whole country.

Now you think they got
reservations about snatching up

this little piece of land

for a few dollars?

All right, man.

Tell me what the
fuck you gonna do.

You gonna kill a federal agent?

No,

I'm not...

but you are.

Wait, what?

The fuck you talking about, man?

Hmm.
I can't kill him.

I'm the fucking mayor.

If you don't,

you'll be an inmate.

Now, I have copies
of those pictures.

You either kill the Fed

or do time in the feds.

You ain't even kidding.

How...

How the he...

How the hell would I even
do something like that?

Hold up, man. Check it out.

Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it.

I got you, okay.

Cut and manufactured

in South Central.

Look, check it out.

No numbers on it,

clean as they come.

You can't
be fucking serious.

Ron...

Ron, you're out of your fucking

You're fucking bugging out.

Look hey,
come on, Randall,

quit with the tough guy act.

Now we both
know you just as soft

as wet toilet paper, okay?

Listen,

but you can do this.

Okay?

If you janky enough
to turn your back

on the city you grew up in,
then you certainly got it in you

to smoke this piece of shit.

Now it has to be done

before the next
city council meeting.

And I'm fully aware
of what's at stake.

Yeah, that's the big voting day.

Wait, you...

You're fucking coming
at me sideways

with your f - fucking
Nat Turner shit.

Fuck, man!

Hey, hey, hey.

It's for the greater good

of South Central.

Oh,

and remember your oath,

partner.

South Central,

it's gonna be another
hot one today.

Make sure y'all staying cool

and y'all staying safe.

Speaking of hot,

here's a banger for your ears.

Make sure you keep tuning in

to K-D-A-Y 1580

on your AM dial.

Ooh, this is my song.

Uh!

Shake that little shit,
but don't break it, girl.

You know you slim.

I need that ass intact

for when I come
back from this run.

We about to turn up tonight.

Hey!
Ah!

This kind of bread,

you might finally go ahead

and let me invite

your bisexual homegirl Kim in

for the tweeze-i-e-zes.

I can't wait to make a
pretzel out of you bitches.

Nigga, hell no.

I don't share my meat.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Why you gotta get
all serious and shit.

We over here

You know how I get

when I get off that sip.

I just recently stopped
calling my mama

on that drunk
repressed feeling shit

nobody care about.

Yeah, whatever.

But what's happening though?

You gonna take this ride up
north with me or what?

I ain't got no babysitter.

Take the little
crumb jacker with us.

Yeah, maybe.

But we gonna need
some more of these

before the night is up.

My nerves just be fucked up

off long trips.

It just remind me of when
I used to visit my dad

in prison in San Luis Obispo.

Long-ass trips for

You expecting company?

Hell no.

Oh. It's probably him.

Where the mustard at?

I ain't playing with you.

Shut up.

Tasha?

Shit! It's Donald.
Fuck!

Man, sit yo' ass down.

Ain't nobody tell

Man, fuck

Let him come get his liability
and get the fuck off.

Okay, but what

Now all of a sudden you wanna

I don't give a fuck
about that nigga.

Shit, man, that motherfucker
ain't got shit on the cable bill

let alone the God damn rent,

so he ain't got no opinion

in this motherfucker.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

So just let the

'cause we got

All you motherfuckers

It's already unlocked.

But what about my bag?

We don't need your bag, baby.

We gonna get you some new stuff.

Okay, daddy.
Come on, baby.

Why you don't quit

Bitch, ain't nobody playing.

This shit real

Say, little nigga,

I suggest you go ahead

and put that gun

'Cause you and and I both know

your little yellow ass

killer, nigga.

You just a
papier-mache ass nigga.

You ain't cut for this.

Besides, it's a real nigga

Putting down premium street meat

So, take your dollar
store thug ass on

while the real daddy's

'Cause that's my bitch.

Oh, yeah, I ain't no killer?

Nah, you

I'm a hole puncher though.

Bitch, shut the fuck up.

Oh, shit!
Bitch, and I'm taking

My daughter too.
No!

You get the fuck off me, bitch.

Y'all deserve shit.

Oh!
Get the fuck off of me.

Get me - give.
Let's get him, bitch.

Homeboy came

Or fucked up!

On a Tuesday.

Hey, what's going on

Y'all gonna make a concerto

Man, Take Two Video

It sound like two fleas fucking

If you ask me,
I think Blakk back there

aimlessly pushing buttons high.

Hey, is he counting

Probably not.

'Cause this time we came up

major weight, home boy.

Nigga,

Man, get

What is that?
Yo, man, what the fuck!

Oh, man, it's
just the police, man.

Just the police?

What the fuck
you mean, the police?

They just come
through this motherfucker

once a month to
check our paperwork

to see if we in compliance,
when they know we are.

Where the fuck
is the paperwork?

It's in the front with Dee.

He gon' show it to 'em

and they gon get
the fuck outta here.

For real.

Man,
what the fuck nigga.

The police in the fucking front.

Fuck. I'mma
go clear this shit out.

Man, hell no, nigga.

Hold the fuck back.

Man, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

Nigga, kill them
motherfuckers, nigga.

Man, hell no, nigga.

It's the fucking police.

You wanna
go to jail, nigga?

Oh, shit!

What the fuck!

Man, what the fuck?

This nigga just pissed
on himself, man.

What the fuck!

Oh, shit!

Nigga, oh, come on.
Scary ass nigga.

Nigga, shut up, nigga.

Pissy ass nigga.

Now the word is,

that you guys have been selling

more than the legal
maximum amount

of grams to any individual

who offers up the
right amount of cash.

Man, you know
that's some bullshit.

No, nigga. That's some
motherfucking real shit.

Y'all still don't believe

that fat meat is greasy?

Well y'all know we've been
on the straight and narrow.

We know the city
didn't want us here

from the beginning.

Well, we gotta see
how straight you guys are.

Come on.

Let's go see all that paperwork.

Y'all on some bullshit.

I see what this is.

Shall we take this to the back?

Y'all wanna unlock
that door for us now?

I really don't.

Please do.

Shazam!

I think we found
their paperwork, partner.

Mm, mm, mm.

Now,

we just gonna, you know,

act like we don't see

these white packages

filled with non-FDA
approved substances.

If y'all make sure

we see green this
time around, dig?

Now, pay attention.

I'll quarterback this for you,

'cause you look a
little like you deficient.

Now, just what we see open

in plain sight,

you're looking
at a long vacation

in a federal penitentiary resort

Mm-hmm.

Oh, yeah.
This is definitely

some Scarface type of shit

going on up in here.

Now listen,

we're talking
municipal violations

of patient purchase
limit violations,

failure to report inventory,

state and federal
crimes of possession

with intent to sell,

what looks like
crystal meth to me

and I haven't
even gotten started

on the RICO acts your
organization has committed.

Now,

just imagine how
they're gonna feel

when this operation shut down

and you just might start

singing like the Temptations.

Nigga, listen.

What the nigga is saying to you

is y'all motherfuckers

need to liquify these palms.

And I ain't talking about

with Jergens, jerk-off.

What's going on here?

What the fuck
is going on here?

Y'all got some damn cats?

It smell like peepee in here.

Oh! Shit!

Oh, fuck! Oh!

Nigga, what the fuck!

Y'all niggas just
shot the police!

Nigga, I'm starting
to like this shit.

What about
these two niggas?

Fuck 'em.

Yo, why the
fuck did you do that?

Nigga, we got three dead

law enforcement
right here, nigga.

Fuck you think
they was gonna say?

They just fell out the sky?

Nigga, the less witnesses
the better, bro.

Nah, he right, baby bro.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know I'm right, nigga.

The fuck
you doing, bro?

Stop playin', Satin.

Nigga, I ain't playin'.

What the
fuck you doing, Dale?

Why the fuck you shoot Bosco?

That nigga would've
died for us, bro!

Nigga, he
just did, nigga.

Now nigga, you next,
Hell no.

Nigga, if you
don't make the

Right decision, nigga.
The fuck?

You in or you out?

You're go-

Whatever the fuck
we gonna do, nigga,

we gotta do that shit.

All right, nigga,
let's get this shit

and get up outta here, nigga.

But before we go,

I gotta let you
know something, bro.

Nigga, that shit could
wait, nigga. What the fuck?

Yeah, it could wait,

but I'mma let you
know right now.

You know that baby

that's in your girl's stomach?

Yeah, that's mine, nigga.

What the fuck
is you talking about?

Do the math, nigga.

You was on hiatus from the pussy

for two weeks, nigga,

before you went to jail.

How you think I know about that?

Huh?

She told me y'all was on break.

She thought you
was still fucking Tasha.

And that night
after you got knocked,

she called me
after you called her.

Now you know why I took so long

for your bond to go through.

I was cashing in on
that coochie first.

She fucked me for your
bail money, home boy.

A pretty admirable thing to do,

but kind of whorish at the same

I told you, you can't
trust these hoes

as far as you could throw 'em.

Let's just get this shit
and get up outta here.

We got a baby
to raise, my nigga.

I woulda merked you, my nigga,

but, uh, somebody gotta
change them shitty ass diapers.

Nigga, fuck you, nigga.

Nigga, fuck me, nigga?

That's how you
talk to the father

of your child, nigga?

Man, nigga, you
couldn't bust your gun

on these motherfuckers,

just like your daddy couldn't

in that massage
parlor robbery in '92.

Did you think I
don't know the foul?

You can't even bust a nut
in your bitch right.

I'm 'posed to think
you finna kill me?

Nigga, stop playing.

Put the gun down, nigga.

You ain't no killer, nigga.
Let's go.

That was a foul little nigga.

Go on, little fool.

Mayor Taylor.

What an ingenious idea

to meet outside the city limits
of South Central.

Big Brother can't
see this far, right?

Yeah.
We don't need anybody

seeing us together after hours.

I attract attention when I move,

especially when I'm with...

special interests.

Yeah, well, my
melanin filled friend,

I don't think anyone's gonna be
able to see you tonight.

Me on the other hand...

How about
we cut to the fucking chase

finalize this shit.

Listening to your
colonizer humor

isn't part of the deal.

Well, I hope selling
out your people

still is.

You have the city council vote,

three to two, in your favor.

That's assured.

It better be.

Do I need to remind you
of the repercussions

should you not fulfill
your end of things?

Excuse me?

Fuck it.

You know what? Let me
go ahead and do something.

I have key people

in high places.

They will jump into
action on command,

and you won't know who

or where they'd be coming from.

Cash,

moves people to do

very dastardly things.

You know this.

Hmm?

You fucking threatening me?

No.

I'm just essentially

reading you the unwritten

penalty clause of our agreement.

If you should
breach this agreement,

a new agreement

will be

executed.

All right, Barnett.

We do it your way.

Fuck you.

And fuck that money.

This South Central all mine.

I'm it's mayor.

Hey, Donald!
Oh shit!

Hurry up!

Oh shit!

Get in the car!

You scared the fuck out of me!

Hurry up!
Whose car is this?

It's one of my brother's. Go!

Oh fuck!

Did you pack the truck?

Of course I did.
Could you not talk shit.

Oh shit!

What happened?
Fuck!

What the fuck is going on?

Oh shit!

Man, just fucking drive.

I'mma tell you
on the fucking road.

Just go.

Don't stop for shit.

We got a long fucking time

to talk about this shit.

Oh, look who showed up

and showed out.

See, I knew you still had

a little nigga left
in you, Randall.

Real men do what they have to.

I never lost sight of who I am.

Let me up in this bitch

before somebody
sees me out here.

Hey, well, come on in,

Mayor.

Clearly, you know it's done.

Of course I do.

Piper is dismantling
and disposing

the body as we speak.

How do I know none of this

is gonna get out?

Look, when
you gonna come down

out of that cloud you in

and realize I have
just as much

to lose as you do,

Mayor?

You know what, you look like

you need some
coffee or something.

You know, I got some of that

freshly imported
shit from Columbia.

You know, let me
be a hospitable boy

and go get you a cup.

You know, how about
a Cuban, huh, to boot?

Ease them nerves? Huh?

Fuentes, my brother?

Fuck you.

Last thing I need is
a fucking cup of coffee

right now, Ron.

You know what?
You're shaky enough without it.

Which is understandable

since this is your
first body and all.

My last one.

Where the master files at?

They're safely stored
away somewhere.

I thought we were square.

Come on, that's leverage, nigga.

You know how you politicians

be flipping and
flopping and shit.

But don't worry.

You know, they're good
as long as you're good.

And I'm not gonna set you up

for the fall like them Feds did.

Very kind to you.

What do you mean by good?

Good and
honorable to my people.

Your priority is to
honor and protect

this city at all costs.

Now as long as we
understand that and

You on the right path.

Look man, those fouls will
never see the light of day.

A'ight.

They better not.

Here you go.

The money Barnett gave me

in exchange for that vote.

That ain't happening now.

You know what, I'm
glad you brought that up.

So now it's three to two
against, now, right?

That's right.

Hmm.

My vote being the swing vote.

Show you right.
Show you right.

Well, you can take that money.

Don't nobody know
where it came from.

I know where it came from.

Hey, man,
look man,

you can put that money

to some good use, you know.

Possibly your
reelection campaign.

That money got blood on it.

Man, what money don't?

Look, you better
take that money, nigga,

before I change my mind.

And then after that,

go home and get you some rest.

We don't want you going
to that city council meeting

looking like a man
who was up all night

doing dirt.

You know,

like committing murder.

Hey look and
don't forget to tell

your colleagues downtown
that they don't have to worry

about that dispensary
over there on Century.

Somebody took
care of that for y'all.

I bet they did.

Boy, life just seem

to get tougher by the day,

especially in a
city like South Central.

I never thought things
would evolve like this.

I could blame the city.

I could blame my father.

I could certainly blame
the powers to be as well.

But I will forever share
some of the blame.

While I figure all that shit out
about how I got here,

I still gotta figure out

where I'm going
from here as well.

If Satin was telling
the truth about my baby

and how I gotta put this
dirty money to good use

and just about
the future overall.

One thing's for sure,

I need to get the fuck
out of South Central.

I might never return.

It's hard to say.

Then again, my
pops is coming home

in a few months.

Ain't no telling what
he gonna be on or need.

I mean, he is South Central.

And I'm a product of him

and our city
forever.
