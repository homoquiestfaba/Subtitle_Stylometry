Damn it Mary!

Jim, you need
to call the plumber.

I can fix it!

Just because you have me
in a monkey suit all day

doesn't mean that I don't
know how to use my hands.

They are getting worse.

It will get better.

Suzy Jacobs
parents fought a lot.

Then her dad left.

Danny,
mom and dad will make up.

They always do.

And, besides if they don't

we move to Canada.
Canada?

What would we do
in Canada?

What everybody
does in Canada.

Go to Niagara Falls
every day and

eat gravy
with our French fries.

Gravy? Canadian's eat gravy

with their French fries?

Why?

Because they're part French,

makes them a little weird.

Suspense
and suspicion have been

developing throughout
Florida this week.

MacDill Air Force Base
in Tampa and

Patrick Air Force Base
in Cape Canaveral

have been put
on alert.

Yesterday the Jacksonville
Naval station

began staging
readiness drills.

Many suspect that these
new developments

may have something
to do with Cuba.

Washington still has
denied this claim.

However, many believe
new hope will be

the topic of tonight's
Presidential address.

We bring you
to the White House

for a special message
from President Kennedy.

Good evening my fellow citizens.

This Government
as promised

has maintained
the closest surveillance

of the Soviet Military build up

on the island of Cuba.

Within the past week,

unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

that a series of offensive
missile sites

is now in preparation

on that imprisoned island.

The purpose of these bases

can be none other

than to provide
a nuclear strike capability.

You wanna let him finish?

I think that is enough,

for tonight.

We'll read it
in the paper tomorrow.

The Commies
have missiles pointed at us?

Yes.
But, where are they?

They're in Cuba.

That's right next
to our house.

It's next to Florida.

Our house is in Davie.

Are they mushroom missiles?

Mushroom missiles?

You know,

the kind
we dropped on Japan.

They look like
a big mushroom.

I don't think
they make those anymore.

Are these missiles new?

Are they better?

I don't want them
to hit us.

They're not going to hit us.

They won't?

No.

Because we're going
to stop them.

Don't worry about
how yet,

I got a plan.

Just get some sleep,

we got a lot of work
to do tomorrow.

As you can see

we're here and
the missiles are there.

What we need to do
is go from point A,

to point B.
But,

how?

We'll build our own rockets,

and we'll fly them over
to Cuba.

Our rockets
will hit their missiles

causing them
to blow up.

But,

if the missiles
blow up

wouldn't that hurt
the people in Cuba?

No,

because these will only
make a blast big enough

to make the Cuban missiles
stop working.

Hello?

Oh,
hi mom.

I think mom is scared

good thing we've sorted out
this missiles business.

No, they're great.

They don't even
seem scared.

No, it's Jim.
I'm worried.

I know.

I know.

Boys, would you like
to talk to grandma?

Hi grandma!

Do you think these will
really make it over to Cuba?

I,

yeah,
of course.

I mean,

if we add side fins any smaller
it probably wouldn't.

But, I added an extra inch
to each side so

we should be fine.

And,
if that fails,

then,
we have this.

I special ordered it
from NASA.

It super propels the rocket
no matter where you want it to go.

I found a way
to solve this missile situation.

We're going to build
a bomb shelter.

A bomb shelter?
Yeah.

How are we going
to put up a bomb shelter?

I had Larry
draw up the plans.

Marian.

We are going to put up
a concrete home

right out
in the back yard.

I've got
more bread in the oven.

Okay, that's it boys.

14 feet. Now pull the string tight.
Push it in right there.

Let me figure out the
hypotenuse

see if this squares up

Are we really
going to live here?

Well if anything hits us
this will be our new home.

Should we tell him
about our plan?

No,

he's preoccupied.

I just think
we should wait

and see
what Kennedy does

before we start
carving up the back yard.

Kenned...
Kennedy is a moron.

It's not like he can just
make the missiles go away.

Alright, alright, alright
fine.

We'll wait
a couple of days

but if he doesn't manage
something soon

I'm going to start digging.

Thanks, Jim.

We'll leave
right after the lunch.

It's okay.
Sometimes that happens.

That's why
we got two.

This is
really going to work.

Mom, dad,

can we turn on
the news?

Go ahead.

A final chapter
in the Cuban crisis

is brought
to a close

as President Kennedy
holds a news conference

to announce that Soviet
bombers on Cuban soil

would be withdrawn
by Russia.

This are the plans
that Castro claimed

he would not
relinquish.

But Mr. Kennedy says
that he has a pledge

right from
the Kremlin.

I have today been

informed
by Chairman Khrushchev

that all of the IL-28 bombers
now in Cuba

will be withdrawn
in 30 days.

He also agreed
that these planes

can be observed and
counted as they leave.

Say it.

Say it, Mary. Say whatever
it is you want to say.

Jim, please listen.

I'm taking the boys
to my parents next week.

For how long?

I don't know.

Trust!

It's true, please.

Miles,

we really did it.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, everything is fine.

Can we go to the beach
again tomorrow?

The beach?

We don't have any more
rockets to launch.

I know.

We did it!

But I had fun.

We don't have to save America
every day to go to the beach.

Okay,

let's go.

The End
