MEL: That's crazy!

MEL: I'm barely...

MONICA: Yeah. I barely have
my hands on here at all.

TESS: What?

MEL: Wow.
MONICA: That is
really moving now.

MEL: Hey!
NICK: Monica?

MEL: What are you doing?

(MONICA LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

What are you doing?

TESS:  <i>Dear Mr. Evans...</i>

<i>My name is Tess Carpenter.</i>

<i>I desperately</i>
<i>need your help.</i>

<i>Something has happened to me.</i>

<i>I innocently</i>

<i>played the Ouija boad</i>

<i>Everything was going fin.</i>

<i>Until, we came acrs</i>

<i>That called himself...</i>

<i>ZoZo.</i>

(CELLO PLAYING)

MR. EVANS: I'm sorry
for your losses.

Is that it over there?

When you feel ready...

I would like to hear
your whole story.

I cannot...get rid of him.

He's with me...all the time.

Constantly.

He wants me to play
his games.

He owns me.

I was normal.

I was once...normal.

(WATER FLOWING)


(TELEPHONE RINGING)

-Hello?
-AIDEN:  <i>Tess?</i>

Hey, Aiden.

Can you hold on a sec?

<i>Hey, so what should I bring?</i>

<i>And who all's joining us?</i>

AIDEN:  <i>Well, as you know,</i>
<i>today is Halloween. So...</i>

<i>Bring a little of that fr</i>
<i>to the island.</i>

<i>Um, grab a costume,</i>
<i>whatever you have.</i>

<i>Along with us two,</i>
<i>magician Nick will be the</i>

<i>and Dean</i>
<i>and his fairly new</i>
<i>girlfriend Mel, the Wiccan.</i>

TESS:  <i>A Wiccan?</i>

<i>Very fitting.</i> (GUSHES)

<i>I'm looking forward to it all.</i>

<i>And your dad is really</i>
<i>cool with us using</i>
<i>his island get away?</i>

AIDEN:  <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>shocking isn't it?</i>

TESS:  <i>It's great.</i>

<i>It's been too long.</i>

AIDEN:  <i>See you soon, Tess.</i>
<i>TESS: </i> <i>See you soon.</i>

DEAN: Wow,
is that really Tess?

Hey guys.

Hey, Tess, come here.
-Hi.

-Oh, it's been too long.
Aw!

-Man, I missed that smile.
-Oh wow, uh...

<i>-Bonjour</i>Aiden.
-What gave it away?

-(GUSHES) The hat.
-Yeah, I know. (GIGGLES)

Hey leave a little
for the rest of us.

-Mmm. Hi.
-It's good to see you again.

Ah, likewise, Nick.

-Hey, Dean.
-Hi, Tess.

-How are you?
Come here.
-Aww!

-(CHUCKLES)
-So good to see ya.

You look great. Oh,

Tess, this is
my girlfriend, Mel.

-Hi, it's very nice
to meet you.
-Nice to meet you as well.

-And I want a hug, too.
-Okay...

Okay I give up, Tess.
What are you supposed to be?

Oh...
Um...

I am an...overworked
college student.

Let's get you into something
a little bit more interesting.

TESS: Okay.

Well, you guys,
it looks like we're all here.

So, uh...

Who's exactly going to take us
over to paradise island?

(MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING)

(MEL GUSHING)

-MEL: Wow...
-TESS: I know.

-AIDEN: Good morning, Skip.
-Aiden, how are you doing?

-Doing good.
-Good.

-Um, everybody ready to go?
-ALL: Yeah.

-Yeah we're all good.
-All right.

-MEL: Let's go, Tess.
-(TESS GIGGLING)

-NICK: Nice bike.
-SKIP: Thank you.

-TESS: Oh, my gosh...
MEL: I love it.

TESS: Do you guys need
any help? Are you good?
-No.

Ladies first.
Come on, Tess.

-How many do we got here?
-Okay.

-SKIP: All right.
-(MEL GIGGLING)

(INDISTINCT SPEECH)

MEL: Oh wow,
look at the water.

-It's so...
-AIDEN: Don't go over.

DEAN: You guys know
I can't swim, right?

-You can't swim?
-DEAN: Yeah.

You going to jump in after me
if I fall in?

-NICK: Definitely.
-I'm a lifeguard,
so I could.

-Seriously, though...
-DEAN: You're a lifeguard?

-No, really I am.
-That's legit.



Everyone, welcome
to my humble home.

-DEAN: You got it, Nick?
-Yep.

So...

Oh, you want to help me
carry these to the kitchen?

-Yeah.
-MEL: Okay.

AIDEN: Hey, you can put that
in the kitchen over there.
DEAN: All right, cool.

-(DEAN HEAVING)
-DEAN: That a boy, Nick.

AIDEN: Guys,
make yourselves at home.

(BOTTLES CLINKING)

DEAN: Oh, look at this view.

Hey, yo, Nicky boy,
heads up.

Oh, good catch.

Wow.

-Hey, yo, Nick, there's
a pool table up here.
-Oh, sweet. (SLURPING)

-AIDEN: Better watch out,
Dean, I'm a shark.
-(DEAN LAUGHING)

AIDEN: Maybe, not so much.

How do you like
the view, Nick?

That's beautiful.

AIDEN: All right everyone,
quick announcement.

Just so you all know

we have two bathrooms
in this house,

but only one shower.

Also, there's no locks on
the doors so...

If you see a door closed
knock don't just walk in.

Um, Nick, Dean,

we're going
to need to go get
some fire wood

it's going to be
a cold weekend.

No problem, man.

Hey your dad's place is
amazing, man.

-Spend a lot of time
here growing up?
-Not really.

Why not, man?
I know I would have.

Camping but,
that's about it.

So not too many times
then, huh?

Nah. I guess I was
kind of a bitter kid.

-You're still are
a bitter kid.
-AIDEN: Get out of my house.

Oh, you really went
all out for Halloween.

We Wiccans prefer to call
this time of year, Samhain.

-Samhain?
-Yeah, it's like
our New Year.

Don't worry
I'm not going to cast
any spells on you.

Thank you.

This is my favorite
time of year.

I brought so many fun goodies,
but first we have to
prepare them.

-Do you want to help
with the pumpkin?
-Sure.

What are you most afraid of?

-TESS: Huh?
-What's one of
your greatest fears?

Um...

I hope this isn't like
creeping you out right now.

MEL: I just really like to get
to know people
through their fears.

Okay. Uh, well,
to be honest...

I am deathly afraid
of closed spaces.

Ah, so you're claustrophobic.

Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

I...

I am terrified of elevators.

-How embarrassing.
-No, no, don't be embarrassed.

I'm terrified of the dark.

So, if we were trapped
in an elevator

and suddenly
the lights went out,
we would be done for.

Exactly!

Okay.

Doctor, Mr. Pumpkin-head's
brains are ready
for extraction.

Just reach in and grab
handfuls of brains.

Put them in the bowl
and go like this.

Squeeze all the seeds
away from the guts, okay?


I've never actually
had toasted pumpkin seeds
before. So...

-MEL: Really?
-TESS: Yeah.

MEL: They are so yummy.

But first it is
important to know that

we can't do any physical labor
without a bit of this.

-TESS: It's a bit early.
-Who's going to know?

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

So tell me
a little more about...

-Samhain?
-Samhain. (WHEEZING)

Well, it's like a...

-Are you okay?
-(GASPING)

(USING INHALER)

Mel?



Samhain is a, uh,
Wiccan ritual

-dating back to way
before Christianization.
-Mmm-hmm.

I know what you might
be thinking
when I say "Wiccan".

You're thinking witch
and witches are evil.

Oh, no, trust me,
I have a very open mind.

If you split up
the year into two

and label one half as light
and the other half as dark

Samhain is the end of
the light half of the year

and the beginning
of the dark half.

It's uh...

Also a time to honor the ones
who have passed.

Crossed over
to the other side.

TESS: Let me put those
beers away for you.

MEL: Oh, thank you.

Oh, gross.

Okay, that is nasty.

Ew, Tess, don't put
your arm in there.

I don't think
that it's even on.

Ugh.

Um, Aiden, come over here
and check this out.

That's weird.

Hey, has anyone tried
turning on the lights yet?

TESS: No, not yet.

Shit.

TESS: Power outage?

Yeah, either that
or a fuse blew.

We're still supposed to have
power this time of year.
Just a second.

Hey, Nick, um, hey,
could you try flicking
that light on for me?

Sure.

<i>Nada.</i>

The oven seems to
be working just fine.

That's 'cause it's gas.

Hmm... Trapped on an island
on Halloween weekend
and now no lights?

What could possibly
happen next?

Well, next we prepare for
a weekend in the dark.

Hey, Tess, could you help me
get some flashlights?

And Nick, Dean,
we're going to need
more firewood.

Watch your step.

And here's your room,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

Just leave this here
for ya and...
-Thanks.

-I'll just be around
getting some flashlights.
-Okay.

NICK: Hey, Tess,
you want to see
a magic trick?

Yeah.

NICK: Aiden, could you get me
a piece of paper
and a pencil?

AIDEN: Yeah,
I'll be right back.

Okay.

-(EXHALES)
Pick a card, any card.
-Okay.

-I'll take this one.
-Okay.

Now take a look at it.
Memorize it.

Great now put it back
in the deck.
Anywhere you like.

-Okay.
-Okay...

Now...

-AIDEN: Here you go.
-Ah, perfect. Thank you.

All right. Now...

DEAN: I think,
I've seen this one.

No, you haven't.
I need to write it down.

-Write down your card
on that piece of paper.
-Okay.

And then just crumple it up.

-Crumple it?
-Crumple it.
There you go.

Thank you. All right.


-AIDEN: Hey, don't burn
my house down.
-(NICK CHUCKLES)

And now, ladies and gents,
let the river of magic flow.

Nick!

All right, now I need you
to check through your deck

because your card is missing.

Where'd it go?

The trick isn't over yet.

All right,
now I need you
to take my hand.

-Okay.
-The other hand.

-The hand that
you wrote with.
-Okay.

All right, now I need
you to imagine the card

going from your mind
to your arm
and into my arm.

-Can you do that?
-Okay.

-Got it?
-Yeah.

All right, we'll see. Now...

-Was that your card?
-DEAN: Dude, you're one
seriously freaky...

That was my card.

Thank you. Thank you.
Please, please,
no standing ovations.

-Nick, how did you...
-Very, very spooky.

Well, it's about to get
even spookier.

This, my friends, will be
the icing on the cake
for such an evening.

I have been dying to know,
what is in here.

MEL: Well, wonder no more.

This is an original
oracle board,

or talking board,
or Ouija or whatever
you want to call it.

My mom always told me
that these things
were dangerous.

No, the boards themselves
are not dangerous.

But some people
may misuse them,

like the way they communicate
through them.

NICK: Tess, you have nothing
to worry about.

-They don't even work.
-(MEL SCOFFS)

How do you know?
Nick, have you played?

Well, scratch that,
they do work,

but its mysteries
don't lie in the realm
of the paranormal.

It's more of
a psychological
phenomenon.

MEL: Well, different strokes
for different folks.

Come on, Tess, it'll be fun.

Wait, what do you mean
"psychological phenomenon"?

Well, as the obvious
would suggest,

you can see
I'm a budding magician.

I'm very interested
in mastering the psychological
aspect of magic.

It's a pivotal tool to have
in order to pull off
a great trick.

Nick, you're sucking the
magic out of Halloween.

No, I still think
that this is fun,

but just in a different way.

I'm still curious about
the psychological
component, though.

Well, not to drag this on
all night,

but big brains such as
Faraday, Chevreul, James,

and my favorite,
and most modern, Ray Hyman.

Have conducted studies of
a phenomenon known as
ideomotor action.

In regard to the movement
of the little triangle thing

around the board
or whatever one would
use to play the game,

scientific studies have been
conducted and concluded
that ordinary,

smart people like ourselves

can participate
in muscular activity
that is...

That is consistent
with their expectations.

So basically your ghost
is nothing more than
unconscious muscle movement

guided by your expectations.

Wow, how boring.

Dude, seriously,
it's more fun to think

that there's actually
a ghost in there
guiding my hands around.

But I heard so many horror
stories about these things.

Ah, but do not underestimate
the power of the mind.

For some that idea
is even scarier.

Here let's focus.
Tess, you in?

Sure, but I'm going to be
more of a passive observer.

Great, but you can't
be too passive.

I need you to record
every letter that the
planchette moves onto.

Aiden, can we have pen
and paper, please?

Thank you.

Okay, first we have
to protect ourselves
from any negative energy.

All right, let's begin.

Please protect us
from anything

that has either negative
energy towards us
or this house.

May we stay safe
within the white light
for we only want to attract

pure energies
with good intentions.

-AIDEN: Amen.
-A toast.

Happy Halloween and
to the end of the harvest.

ALL: Cheers.

Are there any sprits here
with us tonight?

Is there anyone who would
like to talk with us tonight?

-Boo!
-(YELPS) Dammit, Dean!

Get off me.

DEAN: (CHUCKLES)
I'm sorry. Sorry.

Okay.

Are you done?


(NICK LAUGHING)

Are there any spirits
who would like
to talk with us tonight?

-Dean, you have to clear
your mind.
-(LAUGHING)

Everybody, please
clear your mind
and focus on the question.

My mind is being cleared.

Okay.

Is there anyone here
who would like
to talk with us tonight?

Um, I'm not sure
if that's a yes or not.

Looks like a yes to me.

What is your name?

"D-E-D..."

"D."
It spelled out D-E-D-I-D.

Dedid? Dedid it is.

Dedid? What is your last name?

"W

"A

"H

"F

"U

"V."

Um...

"Wahfuv?"

MEL: Is that an English
last name?

TESS: No.

What kind of last name
is Wahfuv?

"C

"H

"E

"C

"L

"K."

"Checlk?"

Are you from
the Czech Republic?


How did you come up
with Czech Republic
out of "Checlk?"

It sounds more like
a piece of gum.

-Yes, he is.
-Ooh.

Are you from Prague?

TESS: It looks like no, but it
never quite got there.

NICK: Maybe candy land.

MEL: Are you from
somewhere else in
the Czech Republic?

Did you move to America?

-"Goodbye."
-Ah! You scared the poor
little Czech guy away.

Well, it wasn't
a terrible start.

Seriously, Dean.
You moving it?

No, I wasn't.

Or, just a thought,
maybe you were unconsciously
pushing it around board.

MEL: Let's try again.

NICK: Yeah, and this time
can we get a spirit
that could actually spell?

(ALL LAUGHING)

MEL: I'll try my best.
Blind-folds on, come on.

Hey.

-Are you freaking
kidding me?
-I didn't do it.

Okay, come on let's just play
with our eyes closed.

Is there anyone here
who would like
to talk with us tonight.

TESS: Yes.

MEL: This one feels
better already.

What is your name?

TESS: Wow, it's legible.
Um, his name is Adam.

Really? My cousin's name
was Adam.

Adam, how old are you?

"24."

Adam, when did you die?

TESS: It just said "one."

Did you die one year ago?

It went to yes.

AIDEN: Mel,
is that your cousin?

I don't know, um...

My cousin Adam died last year
when he was 24.

Adam, are you my cousin Adam?

Adam, are you my cousin?

-Adam, are you there?
-Mel.

-Adam?
-Hey, Mel, I think
it's a coincidence.

Adam, are you still with us?

Hey, Mel, I think he's gone.

-TESS: Are you okay, Mel?
-Yeah, it's just...
I know it was him.

Okay, um, sorry guys.

Okay, let's just, um,
talk to someone else.

Adam is gone for now.
So let's just move on.

Is there anyone here
who would like
to talk with us tonight?

TESS: "Yes."

What is your name?

TESS: His name is Oliver.

Oliver, how old are you?

Aww, he's only eight.

Oh, we got a little boy.

-Hi, Oliver.
-No, no.

-No, no, don't get any ghosts
stuck in my dad's house.
-You're fine.

NICK: Now that would be
pretty funny.

-Yeah, maybe for you.
-MEL: Oliver, how did you die?

TESS: "Choke."

MEL: How did you choke?

-TESS: "Game."
-MEL: Hmm.

What kind of game?

Just went to "choke" again.

What the hell's
the choke game?

The Choking Game.

I think he means
self-asphyxiation.

You know where you
breathe in and out
10 or so times

and then you choke
yourself into euphoria. Mmm.

-DEAN: I'm familiar
with this game.
-You would.

-What?
-Ugh.

MEL: Oliver,
what year did you die?

Oliver, when did you die?

Maybe he was murdered.

MEL: Oliver, what are you
doing right now?

TESS: He's hiding.

MEL: Are you playing
a different game?

Then what are you doing?

TESS: "Danger coming."

-Is that what it said?
-TESS: Yeah.

Oliver, what do you mean
"danger coming"?

-Hmm.
-MEL: What?

"Go safe." With an F.

DEAN: Go to safety?

NICK: Or he meant "save."

As in save yourselves.

-(LOUD THUD)
-Holy shit.

-(TESS GASPING)
-Is there somebody
at the door?

-Aiden, somebody's
knocking at your door.
-(AIDEN SHUSHING)

All right there's
no one knocking
at the door.

Aiden, your dad have a gun
in this house?

Are you kidding me?
My dad's a liberal.

-Is the door locked?
-Yes, just... Shh...

There's no one knocking
at the door.

It was just more of
an isolated bang.

TESS: What?

Aiden, you are
the man of the house.

Go check out this isolated
bang theory of yours.

I'll be behind you.

Yeah.

TESS: Don't open the door.

-Shh...
-DEAN: Yes.

(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

I guess that was a...
There's nothing out there.
It's just a...

DEAN: Cool, Aiden,
shut the damn door.

-(AIDEN GROANS)
-DEAN: That game almost
gave me a heart attack, man.

-(INDISTINCT SPEECH)
-(DEAN LAUGHING)

DEAN: What were you going
to do with that thing, Nick?

I was going to beat it
to death.

We don't know what that was.
It could still be out there.

AIDEN: It was probably
just a tree.

A tree? A tree makes
an isolated bang on the door?

What the hell is an
isolated bang?

Let's play some beer pong?

-Beer pong, yes.
Sounds good.
-Beer pong.

No.

I need to know
what they meant about
danger coming.

(ALL LAUGHING)

-(TESS GASPS)
-Aw, my fault.

-Party foul on Dean, dude.
-MEL: Come on, guys.

TESS: Really?

Dude.

-No. Oh, no, Tess. No.
-Quarters?

-Quarters?
-No.

Dean, come on.

TESS: It will be fun.
Just a little bit longer.

All right.

Oliver, are you still there?

Are you still with us?

You see. I told you.

It's the guy who killed Oliver
and now his coming for us.

Dean it is not the guy
who killed Oliver.

And he is certainly
not going to waste
his precious spirit time

to come out of the board
and kill you.

And for the last time,
put your hands
back on the planchette

and shut you face hole.

Damn, look at
the possessed girl.

My face hole is going to get
a cold beer.

Fine.

-Shut your face hole?
-(ALL SNICKERING)

-DEAN: Shut up, Nick.
-Shut your face hole?

-I've never heard that before.
-MEL: Nick.

Seriously, just calm down.

Relax, okay.

MEL: Okay.

Tess, will you please
fill Dean's spot?

TESS: Sure.

Nick, Aiden, will one of you
please transcribe?

Something interesting
is going on here.

AIDEN: Trade me spots.

MEL: If you're not Oliver,
then who are you?

AIDEN: Wow. (GRUNTS)

What?

It just said...

Well, not perfectly...
But it just said,
"Fuck you, bitch."

DEAN: I've got to see this.

MEL: Did the board
just call me a bitch?

Yup, it sure did.
My kind of spirit.

-Really, Dean?
-(NICK LAUGHING)

Did you just call me a bitch?

AIDEN:
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)
Well, now you're a slut.

Did you just call me a slut?

AIDEN: "Yes."

-Thanks, Aiden,
I can see that.
-AIDEN: Okay.

Hostile little prick.

I'm not afraid
of this asshole.

I'm not afraid of you.

Who are you?

-MEL: You getting all this?
-Yeah, every letter.

"I will come to you
in the dark when
you are most scared."

Mel's afraid of the dark.

-MEL: Shut up, Dean.
-Seriously.

You know what guys,
let's just put
this thing away.

-MEL: No.
-Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

No. Um, let's keep
having fun.

Besides, I've never seen
this thing work so well.

Would you mind asking it
a few questions?

TESS: What... What do I ask?

MEL:
Whatever your heart desires.

Um...

Hello?

Are you...
Are you still with us?

AIDEN: "Yes."

Did you kill Oliver?

Tess.

"No." (CHUCKLES)
Well, that's a relief.

TESS: Did you hurt him?

Tess, Oliver's...
Oliver's dead.

MEL: Dean.

Um, who... Who are you?

"I

"am

"your

"guardian."

TESS: My guardian?

What do you mean,
"my guardian"?

"I

"will

"take

"you

"to

"paradise."

TESS: Why... Why do you want
to take me to paradise?

"You

"are

"mine."

What is your name?

AIDEN: "Messy Tessy."

Messy Tessy?

That's what...

That's what my mom
use to call me
when I was a little girl.

AIDEN: How in the hell
would it know that?

DEAN: Damn.

What is your name?

What...
What is your real name?

-TESS: What is it?
-MEL: I don't know.
I've never seen this before.

AIDEN: It's just counting
down from ten.

TESS: Who are you?

AIDEN: "I

"am

"Z-O-Z-O-Z-O-Z-O."

TESS: Is your name Zo?

"No."

TESS: Is your name ZoZo?

AIDEN: "Yes."

Sounds Greek.

AIDEN: "I

"am

"ZoZo.

"I am ZoZo.

"I am ZoZo."

MEL: What do you want?

"ZoZo

"wants

"to

"kill you."

Over my dead body, asshole.

AIDEN: "Yes."

Oh, yeah,
when you going to kill us?

Dean, don't ask
those kind of questions.

AIDEN: "12."

Well, if he means 12 midnight,
he's late.

It's after 12.

NICK: Or he could mean
tomorrow at midnight
or noon tomorrow...

Nick, we get it.

-Mel, why is it moving?
-I don't know.

AIDEN: "ZoZo

"wants

"to"

"sleep

"with

-"Messy Tessy."
-MEL: Ugh.

Is just me
or is this third person shit
getting anyone else?

Hey, you guys,
I really don't want
to play anymore.

NICK: I have one question.

TESS: Nick.

Nick, I really don't want
to play this thing anymore.

NICK: Tess, I just
have one more question

and I promise
it will be a good one.

Remember this is just
your subconscious mind.

Okay, ZoZo,

if you say
that you are real,

then prove it.

Do something
to show us
that you are real.

"Pick...a...card."

NICK: For real?

You asked for it, bro.

Pick a card any card.
Don't show any of us

and then put it back
in your deck.

Okay. Now what?

-AIDEN: Tess.
-ZoZo...

What's next?

"Magic."

Are you going to do
a magic trick?

"Yes."

When will you do
the magic trick?

ZoZo?

What's next?

Well, see if the card's
in the deck.

All right fine,
but I think this is
bordering on ridiculous.

Hold on.

-It's not here.
-DEAN: Bullshit.

You're not playing
another trick on us?

Yeah.

My card was
the Ace of Spades
you find it genius.

That's the same card
that I choose.

Ask... Ask where
Nick's card went.

ZoZo, where is Nick's card?

"ZoZo...has...it"

ZoZo, where are you?

AIDEN: "The bathroom."

You're in the bathroom
in this house?

"Yes."

NICK: Aiden, you go
check it out.

I'm behind you.

AIDEN: Yeah.

(INHALING DEEPLY)

There's nothing
in there, guys.

NICK: Then what happened
to my card?

AIDEN: Seriously, Nick,
enough with
your stupid tricks.

Enough of what tricks?

The card really vanished.

What about the other bathroom?

AIDEN: Here we are.
NICK: Same drill?

AIDEN: Yeah.

(SHUDDERING SOFTLY)

-Holy Shit!
-NICK: Hey, what did you see?

Somebody there,
there's somebody there!

DEAN: What did you see?
What did you see?

AIDEN: It's dark!

DEAN: What was it, man?

AIDEN: It was...
I don't know.

DEAN: He's totally freaked.

NICK: This is crazy.
Let me get in here.

-TESS: Nick.
-MEL: No, don't.

AIDEN: Please don't, dude.

I'm going to get
to the bottom of this, okay?
I'm sick of this.

I'm going to figure out
what's going on here.

AIDEN: Take this.

It's going to be okay.

All right?
It's going to be okay.

(NICK EXHALES DEEPLY)

Here is your ZoZo.

MEL: Bravo. But, Nick,
where's your card?

TESS: Let's get back up stairs
and say good-bye to the board.

It's not good
to leave it open.

There that should do it.

This will be
a memorable session.

Nick, your card is gone
and it's not coming back.

It's got to be around
here somewhere.

I'll find it.

Well, here's to
one freaky night.

What?

Nothing let's go
to bed, come on.

Well, boys and girls,
I'm being called to arms.

Come on.

DEAN: Cheers.
-(MEL SIGHING)

Nice. (GROANS)

Bed does sound good
right about now.

-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

AIDEN: Goodnight, Nick.


AIDEN: Well, now,
that was an interesting
night, huh?

It was.

It was also
very unsettling.

Oh, I think our imagination
just got the best of us.

-Nick was right
about that part.
-Yeah.

It's just that it...

Well it's hard to explain,
but...

It left me with
this strange feeling.

This feeling carries
a lot of weight.

Don't worry, Tess.

By tomorrow morning,
you'll be a 100 percent.

-Will I?
-Absolutely.

May I?

Yes, you may.

Night.

Night.

(DOOR OPENING)




(WATER FLOWING)

MEL: Tess, are you sure
it just wasn't like
a bad dream or something?

I mean... I've had some
crazy realistic dreams.

They can feel
so freaking real sometimes.

TESS:  <i>This seemed so real.</i>

<i>It was real.</i>

<i>It reminded of something</i>
<i>that happened to my mom,</i>

<i>at the time she was pregt</i>
<i>with my sister.</i>

This really freaked me out
when she told me this.

Um, but one night
she was lying in bed

and all of a sudden
something grabbed her ankles,

and dragged her
off of the foot of the bed.

She struggled to stay on

and she even called
for my dad who was lying
right next to her.

-He never woke up.
-Really?

He would just think that
she had bad dreams, but...

But he could never explain,

why in the morning
he found her on the floor
at the foot of the bed.

Still with the sheets
wrapped tightly in her hands.

Wow.

The very next night,

minutes after getting
into bed, um...

She was overcome
by a strong force.

That left her
completely paralyzed.

-Wow.
-Um...

Kind of like
what happened to me
last night.

She felt like something
was holding her down.

And minutes later,

she was floating
above her body.

She started to, um,
to crawl along the ceiling,

to the door,

into the hallway
and eventually
into the living room.

She said that that's
where she witnessed

the most horrible sight
in the world.

There was a fire,
everywhere.

But she said the most
disturbing part...

...was that there was
a baby crying.

A baby?

She woke up
in the worst state of terror.

And she was clutching
her stomach

to see if the baby
was still there.

That's creepy shit.

You know it's kind of weird.
I mean...

Tess, I haven't really known
you that long, but...

I pictured you as
an only child.

Um, I am.

My sister died
from complications

just three days
after being born.

I have a secret to tell you.

Last night when
you were having
your nightmare/dream thing,

I stayed up
and played the Ouija board.

What?

Why?

I don't know, um...

I had this overwhelming
urge to play it.

I got in contact
with my cousin again.

What do you mean?

Adam. My cousin Adam?

He contacted me
through the board.

It was him.
It was him. I knew it.

It was so nice
to talk with him.

Oh, Mel.

-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

Now, that I think about it,
the really weird thing was...

He was asking me
a lot about you.

Me?

Mel, he doesn't even know me.

Why would he
be asking about me?

I don't know. He said...

He was saying stuff like
he thought you were
really pretty.

And he was sad
that he wasn't still alive,
because...

Because if I think
he were still alive

he would wanted to go
on a date with you.

Mel, he doesn't even know
what I look like.

Why would he
be asking about me?

You were sitting right
across from me

when he contacted us
the first time, Tess.

Look at you.
You're beautiful.

In the likeness of
a true Goddess.

Lucky me.

Let's go bury apple seeds
and celebrate this day.

-Come on.
-Bury apple seeds?

Yeah, let's go.
Come on, Tess.

-Come on. Come on.
Come on!
-TESS: Okay!

-Where do you want
to bury them?
-Because it's fun!

Celebrate.

Let's go.

TESS: Oh, my God, be careful.
Don't slide.

MEL: Tess, let's go!
Let's celebrate!

(BOTH GIGGLING)

DEAN: How's your bitch, Nick?

NICK: One beautiful bitch.

(ALL LAUGHING)

TESS: Oh, my gosh.

-(MEL SCREAMING)
-DEAN: She's going
in the oven.

-(MEL SHRIEKING) You jerk.
-Put her in.

MEL: Oh, my God.
Oh, why, thank you.

-Let's see that baby.
-NICK: Oh, yeah, dude.

AIDEN: Oh, whoa,
Nick, no, no, no...

-Okay. Hold it.
-That is so gross, Nick.

NICK: This is,
this is fantastic.

AIDEN: That's yummy.

-TESS: Oh, kiss it.
-MEL: What?

-NICK: Oh, yeah, kiss it.
-Kiss it, Mel!


DEAN: Oh, yummy!

(DEAN COUGHING)

-Your turn, Tess.
-No!

No, I'm okay.

-Why'd you do that?
-Who's hungry?

-You guys are adorable.
-I'm hungry!

-Go ahead.
-Oh, my gosh.

-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

-All right.
-Are you going
to bake it?

No. No, no...

Over an open fire?

-Ooh!
-Yeah.

-So cool.
-Yeah.

-Nice.
-Hunters, build me a fire.

-NICK: All right!
-So primal.

Are you... No.

MEL: Ugh, it's crunching!


TESS: Oh, my God!

MEL: Ugh.

Come on, Tess, let's go.

Oh, yeah, Aiden,
we're going to go
build the fire.

Tess! Tess! Hey, Tess.
I, uh, need your help.

You don't look too happy.

You want to get
me some brown sugar?
And, yeah. Okay. Sorry.

TESS: I can handle that.
Where is our brown sugar
in this house?

It should be over there
somewhere.

TESS: Okay.

AIDEN: Ah, its heart.

TESS: Ah, brown sugar.


-AIDEN: Let's take
the head off.
-(TESS GASPS)

TESS: How are you
doing this, Aiden?

AIDEN: Ah, been a fisher
for a long time.



Wow, hats off to Aiden
because this is delicious.

Aiden, if I was a vegetarian,

I could literally live on this
yumness, man.

It's unbelievable.

NICK: I have to agree
with that, you know, Aiden,

-I need to know the recipe.
-Mmm-mmm.

Sorry, Nick. Family secret.

NICK: Come on!
Help me out here,
I'm a single guy.

-This could impress the best.
-(TESS GIGGLES)

AIDEN: It does.

How'd you learn
how to cook so well?

It's kind of rare these days.

Uh, two years
of culinary school.

But how, I thought
you guys were all
the same age.

Not me.
I'm a couple years older
than the rest of the guys.

Mmm. But, then how did
you guys all meet?

DEAN: I actually
met Aiden first.

Yeah, he at the time was, uh,
volunteer ambulance guy...

And there was a time
when I wasn't sleeping
too good.

Well to make
a long story short,

sleeping pills and liquor
are not the best mix.

Aiden here,
basically saved my life.

He did save my life.

I never knew that.

To say the least,
it was a long time ago, and...

It's kind of embarrassing.

Oh, what about Tess and Nick?

Mmm. Freshman year.
Music appreciation.

-MEL: Aw, cute.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

And here I am.

AIDEN: And here we are.

-Cheers to that.
ALL: Cheers.

All right, well, guys,
really quick.

I would like to introduce
you to another one
of my family secrets.

This, my friends,
was maliciously stolen

just one hour ago
from my father's secret stash.

My great-grandfather's
pure grain alcohol,

a.k.a. The Fourth Horseman.

(DRUM ROLL)

All right.

The Fourth Horseman.
Very fitting.

Oh, just wait.

-Oh, wow.
-(CHUCKLING)

Don't be cheap on me now.

You don't need a lot of this.

Thanks, brother.

So this Fourth Horseman.
Is it like moonshine?

Kool-Aid compared to this.

-That's what
I'm talking about.
-Yeah.

-Oh, I think I'm going
to pass on this one, guys.
-Oh no.

-Oh, come on, Tess!
-This is an experience.

-(SIGHS)
-Okay.

It looks as innocent
as water.

Innocent on the outside,
wicked on the inside.

Flight attendants,
please be seated for take-off.

Oh, and a toast,

to our dreams,
our happiness,

and, most importantly,

our friendships.

Oh, and after this weekend,
we'll all be seeing
more of each other.

Cheers to that, man.

ALL: Cheers!

Here goes.




Your grandfather wasn't
messing around, man!

-No!
-This is ridiculous.

No he wasn't.

Hey, it's your turn.

No, don't take it!

MEL: Come on, Nick. Do it!

-Don't.
-Hit that!

-Go!
-No. Nick, you don't.
Don't, Nick.

Now do it, Nick.
Do it!

AIDEN: Oh!

DEAN: Good boy, Nicky!

Wow!

Wow!

Wow!

Wow!

(ALL LAUGHING)


(DOOR CLOSING)

TESS: Mel.

Mel.

Mel.

Hey, Tess.

What happened?

You drank yourself
to dream land.

I only had a little bit.

But that was all you needed.

Apparently.

Where is everyone?

Alcoholic Dean is passed out
under the pool table.

And Nick and Aiden
went with the bottle
to find the answers to life.

Wow, I must have
been really out.

What are you doing?

Come sit with me.

No.

Haven't you had
enough of this thing yet?

I've been talking
with Adam all night.

Come sit with me.

Adam? No.

No, Mel,
I'm not in the mood to play.

Tess, we've been
chatting up a storm.

Watch.

TESS: Mel, please.

Adam, Tess is here with us.

Tell her what
you were telling me.

Tell her our secret.

Adam, we can trust her.
Tell her our the secret.

TESS: What are Aiden
and Nick doing
out so late?

Tell her our secret.

I need to get some water.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Hey, Tess.

TESS: Yeah.

Could you do me a favor?

TESS: Sure.

Could you get me my inhaler
from the bathroom, please?

Okay, Mel.

MEL: There's a bunch
in my purse.
You can't miss it.

TESS: Mel?

Mel?

(TESS GASPING)

Mel.

Mel.

Mel.

Mel.

Mel.

Mel, I have your inhaler.

Mel.

Mel.

-(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
-Mel!

Mel!

Mel, Mel, Mel, stop it!

Mel! Mel! Mel!
Come on!

-Oh, my God, Mel!
-(GASPING)

-Mel!
-(WHEEZING)

Now look, I have your inhaler.
Just use it. Take it.

Mel! No! Hold on, Mel!

Mel, just breathe! Hold on!

-Mel, just hold on!
-(WHEEZING)

-(MEL SCREAMING)
-(DOOR SLAMMING)

Oh, no.

No. No!

No! Aiden!

Dean! Nick!

Somebody help!

No!

Someone! Dean!

Aiden! Someone!

Mel.

(MEL WHEEZING)

I'm sorry, Mel.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

(MEL WHEEZING)

(MEL GASPING)

(TESS GASPS)

No!

No!


That was the beginning
of my hell.

And the end...of my existence.

Mr. Evans?

Am I crazy?

No, you're not crazy.

TESS: Who is he?

Who is ZoZo?

What is ZoZo?

ZoZo is a force

<i>that has chosen</i>
<i>to reside inside you.</i>

<i>He selects certain people</i>

<i>through the use</i>
<i>of Ouija boards.</i>

<i>Like a bird of prey,</i>

<i>it comes to those</i>
<i>who play the game.</i>

<i>You have to let it go.</i>

TESS:  <i>But what about</i>
<i>the board?</i>

<i>-No one can find it...</i>
<i>-MR. EVANS: </i> <i>I'm here.</i>

<i>I'm going to take</i>
<i>the board with me.</i>

TESS:  <i>Are you going to</i>
<i>get rid of it?</i>

MR. EVANS:  <i>Yes.</i>
<i>TESS: </i> <i>Promise?</i>

MR. EVANS:  <i>I promise.</i>

<i>I know it's not easy, Tess.</i>

<i>I know what</i>
<i>you're feeling inside.</i>

<i>Let it go.</i>

<i>Release it.</i>

<i>Let it go.</i>

<i>Let it go.</i>

TESS: Torment.
