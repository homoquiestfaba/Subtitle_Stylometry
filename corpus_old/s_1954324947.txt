Mr. Altmann.

I don't know when!
When I get there!

The doctor will be in to see you
as soon as she can.

He. Dr. Fielding is a he.

Yeah, well, Dr. Fielding has been
called away, unfortunately.

So Dr. Gill will be covering
his patients today.

When?
As soon as she can. She's very busy.

Now, please, put that gown on!

I don't need a gown!

I'm just meeting him- Her.

Oh.

What the hell'?
I'm asking, what the hell?

I've been waiting here for over two hours.

I'm very sorry, Mr. Altmann.
It's just been a bit crazy.

Who are you?
I'm Dr. Gill.

I want Dr. Fielding.

I understand,
but he was sent away on an emergency.

Emergency. Bullshit!
He just wanted to get a jump on the weekend.

Sir, I was able to look over your scan-

Are you even old enough
to practice medicine?

Has Dr. Fielding gone over
the results with you?

No.

No, as in he hasn't called?

He thinks it's migraines.
I have headaches, bad ones.

When did he say that?
When I was here last.

That was before the scan?

Yeah.

What?

Can you please sit down?
Why?

Because I would like for you to sit.
Why does it matter?

Because I need you to sit down.
I need to stand.

Fine, stand.

The results showed a brain aneurysm.

Wow.

Mr. Altmann...

do you know what a brain aneurysm is?

My uncle died of one.

One minute he was brushing his teeth,
the next, he was dead.

Didn't even have time to rinse.

It's a ballooning-out
of an artery wall in the brain.

And when it pops?
That would be a hemorrhagic stroke.

And I'm dead.

The seriousness depends on the size
and location of the aneurysm.

How big is it?

I'm an internist.
It's best if you speak to a specialist.

You have the scan right there! How big'?
I understand.

But there's a specialist, a neurologist at Brooklyn-
You know, right?

Dr. Bernstein. I already called.
I made arrangements-

What are you scared of'?
It's not your brain!

Just look at the scan and tell me!

It's big.

And the location?

Please, sir, I think ifs best
that we talk to a neurologist.

The location?

By the brain stem.

Untreatable?

It's not for me to say.

You already have.

How long has it been there?
A long time, I'm betting.

Why didn't they find it till now?

Are you incompetent
or you just don't care?

That's it, you don't care, do you?
No. No, no, no.

No what?
No, I do care!

Bullshit! You're thinking,
how inconvenient, how annoying...

how difficult, how disagreeable.

Poor little princess. Poor, poor you.
Well, excuse me for dying!

Sir, I need you to stay calm.
It's bad for your blood pressure.

Please sit back down.
How long do I have?

I don't know.
Yeah, you do.

No, I don't.
It's all over your face like a pinched lemon!

The Lemon Princess.
You think you can hurt my feelings?

You don't care, remember?
This is just a job! You don't feel this!

Probably takes a diamond commercial
or a sick cat...

to get some feelings out of you!

Oh. Sick cats,
is that what makes you tick?

That's what makes

What true?

saying you told some patient...

that he has 90 hours to live.

No!

I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy.

That's-

What?

Nothing.

You did!
No, I didn't!

I knew it!
I didn't.

Everybody's saying you did!
Jordan, be quiet!

Told a guy he had 90-
Would you get in the room?

I know! I know! He just kept yelling...

â€œGive me a number!
Give me a number! A number.â€

And I couldn't breathe,
and I panicked and I totally lost it.

Apparently.

God, I- Ooh, I hated him.

Well, that one I can't fault you on.
We all hate our patients.

What's wrong with the guy anyway'?

Cerebral aneurysm.

And you let him walk out of here?

That wasn't the plan!
Christ!

I was trying to send him to Bernstein, okay?

Seriously, Christ, Sharon.

I know, I know.
I'm horrible. I'm a horrible person.

I have been trying to get a hold of him.

I've called his cell, his home, his work,
and he just won't pick up.

Why are you looking at me so funny'?

What's up with your eyes right now?
Are you high?

Not now. I'm serious.

For real'?
Yeah, for real!

Sharon, this is bad.
There's gonna be consequences.

You could get suspended.
You could lose your license.

He wasn't even my patient!

He was Fielding's!
I was just covering for him!

â€œOh, I wanna spend the weekend
with my family.

I have kids. I have a life."

Stupid, back-stabbing motherfucker!

I warned you.
No, you didn't.

Yes, I did.

He said he was gonna get a divorce, okay'?

He said that he loved me. He-

Human emotion, I find it very off-putting.

Let's focus on the logic.
Like the patient. What's the guy's name?

Altmann. Henry Altmann.

Okay, Henry Altmann.
That's a great name.

That sounds like a very wholesome,
nice family man's name.

I'm sure this is not the type of guy
who's gonna freak out...

file complaints, just go totally nuts on you,
trying to ruin your career.

Ohh.

Okay, I'm getting the impression
maybe he is that type of guy.

This is bad.
This is miscommunication, is what this is.

I need to get him admitted
to a hospital today, for his own good...

and then he's somebody else's problem.

Then he's Bernstein's problem. Right?

Can't hurt.

I have to find Henry Altmann.

A Dr. Gill has been calling for you.

Where's Aaron?
She said it was extremely important.

Where's Aaron?

In the meeting.

148 and 65 Charles Street.

There is a six-month advance on the one
and a six-month delinquency on the other.

My long-lost brother.

What if you pick up
the pending violations on 148?

Garbage.
And boiler.

I have a question.
About the boiler'?

No, I need some advice.

A client, he just found out
he has 90 minutes to live.

What should I tell him to do'?
Henry, we really need to get back to this now.

I know what I would do.
What'?

Cry.

For the first 20 minutes.

Then I'd go to that Thai massage place
on York and get a blowjob.

I'd go to Temple Israel, pray a little,
make a nice big donation.

Can we get back to this now?

Me, I think I'd kill someone.
Why?

For the social good.
Some deeply evil schmuck.

Like who?
We live in Brooklyn. How hard could ii be?

I got a joke. Hang on a second.

Man goes to see a doctor,
and he's told that he only has 10 hours to live.

It's a terrible shock.
What's he gonna do?

So he picks up the phone
and he calls his wife, and he says...

â€œHoney, I'm gonna take you to the Four Seasons,
the best restaurant in town...

and we're gonna eat everything
on the menu.

And then, we're gonna go
to the Rainbow Room...

where we're gonna dance all hours,
like we were young again.

And then, finally, home,
where we will make mad, passionate love...

till all hours of the night,
until, at last, at dawn...

I will die in your loving arms.

What do you think of that?"

And the wife says, â€œEasy for you.

You don't have to get up in the morning."

Henry.
What?

Tell your client to go home,
make love to his wife one last time and be happy.

In the end...

all we have is family.

Family?

You're right.

Family. Thanks.

You're not gonna be billing us
for this crap, are you?

Hey, hey, Henry, wait up!

Where you going?
Home.

You know, if you want out
of the meeting just say so...

or don't show up like you always do...

but this bullshit is really annoying.

Is this gonna take a long time?

You know, you're getting worse.

You know that, right,
that you're getting worse?

I got a lotto do.
In 90 minutes?

Less.

Family?

Yeah, family.

So, what, brothers don't count?
Because we got a lot of work to do.

I'm thinking, you know, immediate family.
Like Bette, Tommy.

What?

Well, uh, come on, Henry.
Bette and Tommy?

You and Bette have done nothing
but fight for two years. And Tommy?

What do you know about family, Aaron?

The only family you've got is a goldfish.

I know your family, your immediate family.

<i>I Henry Narrating 1
Henry was fully committed...</i>

<i>to make tender love
to his wife one last time.</i>

<i>Bu! there were concerns.</i>

<i>For one, he couldn't 't remember
the last time they'd done it.</i>

<i>A year ago? Maybe more.</i>

<i>Henry also wondered what was
the appropriate position for a last shtup?</i>

<i>He assumed spooning must be in valved.</i>

<i>Then again, he had read
that condemned prisoners...</i>

<i>often asked for peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches as their last meal.</i>

<i>Certainly, the missionary position
was the PB&J of sex.</i>

<i>And, of course, there
was Henry's biggest concern.</i>

<i>Would he be able to raise the ï¬‚ag at all?</i>

<i>As Henry ran, he prayed,
not for a medical miracle.â€œ.</i>

<i>but for the sample ability to get 1? up.</i>

I know I shouldn't be telling you this...

and ifs going against every protocol...

but, um...

your brother was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm
and is refusing treatment.

Oh, God.

Well, uh...

are you his doctor'?
Yes.

Well, no. I mean, I'm filling in
for his doctor, Dr. Fielding.

And this diagnosis is definite?

I'm afraid so.

He- He was just here...

and I was awful.

You didn't know.

I knew something was strange.

But with Henry,
there's always something sort of strange.

He had a son, Peter. Great kid.

Died two years ago
in a hunting accident, of all things.

Henry's never been the same since.

We used to have lunch together every day.

He would bring
a brown paper bag in and we-

Two sandwiches.
One for him, one for me.

We talked about everything.

And now we don't talk
about anything anymore.

Wait. Ninety minutes.

How can you be sure it's only 90 minutes?

That's a misunderstanding.

How do you misunderstand that?

The important thing is we find your brother...

and get him admitted
to a hospital immediately.

He went home.

Bette, it's Aaron.
I'm on my way to your apartment.

Call me back on my cell.
It's an emergency. Any instructions?

Oh, um. Make sure that he remains calm.

Nothing that raises his blood pressure.

Like?
Anger.

And you've met my brother?

Henry, I thought you were working late.

Frank, hi. Get out.

What's going on?
He needs to leave!

He's our neighbor!

No, no. I need you alone.

Why?

Because we have to have sex immediately
and then cuddle.

What, are you nuts?

No, no. I just wanna have a moment,
a husband and wife moment.

<i>It'll</i> be a good thing, a family thing.
I don't have a lot of time.

I really think I should go.
You stay.

Go!
You're staying!

Stop that! I don't care how crazy you are,
we are not having sex.

Oh, but, Bette, listen...

I know the last two years
have been tough...

and I didn't deal well with, you know...

and I've been erratic
and often pissed off at things.

You think?
But it doesn't mean I've stopped loving you in my own way.

And in the end, what is there?
Family. Our family.

And this is our default position,
me and you.

And making love to you is my way
of telling you I know what's important.

We can do it in the kitchen, if you like.

What the hell is the matter with you?

Can't I make love to my wife'?
No.

Why the hell not?
Because sex isn't some magic switch you pull...

just because you're feeling
a momentary twinge of guilt.

Guilt? What guilt?
About being horrible?

Who said I was horrible?
Oh, I thought that part was obvious.

What's he still doing here?
I-l really-

You know what? Stay!
You always were a little bit of a jerk...

but you were an amusing jerk.

But since Peter, you're just a jerk!

I lost a son, for Christ's sake!

And I didn't?

You just can't honor the son we lost...

and you drove away the one
we do still have!

Tommy doesn't deserve that!

This has nothing to do with Tommy!

You never accepted his life choices!

Ballroom dancing is not a life choice...

it's a Tuesday night on a Fiesta cruise!

Fuck you!
Yeah.

Oh. You still want that husband and wife moment?
Maybe.

Do you even remember
the last time we had sex'?

Yeah! Um-
Well, I don't!

Because I have sex all the time,
just not with you!

Frank?

No way!
Why not Frank?

Forty-three.

I'm dying.
Right. Long as you don't need any money.

Because I am broke-o.

No, no, just dying.

Right. Who isn't?

Oh.

For real.

'Cause I thought you were talking

'Cause I feel like
I've been dying for years now.

Brain aneurysm.
I have a brain aneurysm and-

Oh, Henry.

Oh, Henry, I'm sorry.

Oh, buddy, that sucks.

Yeah.

How much time they give you?
Hour and a half.

That's it?

Apparently.

And you wanted to spend it with me?

I'm touched. No, I'm touched.

Because old bonds are the strongest, right?

Yeah.
And I know what you're going through...

because last year I had kidney stones...

and before I passed them,
I felt like I was gonna die.

You know,
they say it's worse than childbirth.

You got two kids, right?
Had.

Yeah, I got your Christmas card
like 12 years ago.

Oh, you looked so happy.

Me'? I never had kids.

But I think it was for the best
because I got to explore my passions.

I'm a gamer.
I'm kind of a minor celebrity if I say so myself.

Dagon they call me.
Ever hear that name, Dagon?

No. Dagon, no.
Yeah, that's what they call me.

You remember that girlfriend
that you stole from me in high school?

What?

Gloria.
Remember you stole Gloria from me?

Who?

Gloria Cameron.
Remember? Redhead.

No.

Oh, come on!
You really don't remember her?

What the hell are you talking about?
Love.

Love! How you squashed it!

I tell you I'm dying
and all you can talk about is you?

You and some high school crush
from 40 years ago?

I wanted to get it off my chest!
And you had to wait till now?

Not my fault ifs now or never!
You really don't remember her?

This is insane! I'm sorry you turned
into some lonely, pathetic fuck, Dagon!

But I have to go. Fuck you!

No, fuck you.

Tell him the truth.

Oh, this ought to be interesting.

Officer, a little over an hour ago,
this cab hit my car.

Then I went to the hospital
and Dr. Gill told me that I had a brain aneurysm...

and I had 90 minutes to live.
From the car accident.

No. Then I went to my office
and this guy was telling a joke...

about a man having sex with his wife
one last time, and I thought...

â€œHey, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll go home and try it with mine.â€

I get there and there's my wife
sitting with my neighbor.

Turns out they've been shtupping
the whole time and I had no idea.

So I get out of there and I go to Juniors...

and I invited all these people to say good-bye
to them and only one guy shows up...

and he's pissed off at me
for stealing his high school sweetheart...

who I don't even remember!
Calm. Calm.

So I go across the street
to buy a video camera from this nice guy.

A little bit- D-D-D-D- But still a good guy.
Not the fastest salesman.

And I give the video camera to a homeless guy
to videotape me talking to my son.

And I get a little upset
because after law school...

he decides to be a dance instructor
rather than a lawyer.

The homeless guy?
No, my son.

I had all these business cards printed up.
But what can you do?

I got upset and then I passed out.

And when I came 10,
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge.

That's when she shows up.
She jumps in the East River.

She fishes me out.
That's why we're wet.

Then we got picked up
by the same cabbie who hit me earlier.

She maces him
and that's how we got this cab.

Weird, huh?
Yeah.

You weren't kidding
about him needing brain surgery.

No, no, no, not at all!

Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And I left.

And everything changed.
