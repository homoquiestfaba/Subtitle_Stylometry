[phone ringing]

<i>You've reached the home</i>
<i>of Leonard Nimoy.</i>

<i>Anybody but Bill Shatner</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>


Uh, this is
William Shatner.

<i>Leonard, will you</i>
<i>pick up?</i>

<i>I want to invite you</i>
<i>to the roast.</i>

<i>It's gonna be fantastic.</i>

<i>Pick up the phone,</i>
<i>Leonard.</i>

Hello?
<i>Leonard!</i>

<i>Billy.</i>
Great.

Bill, are you in trouble?
<i>What are you--</i>

I saw something on TV
about your toast.

<i>Roast, you idiot.</i>

Turn up the sound
on your hearing aid.

Oh, Bill,
those roasts are terrible.

You shouldn't be--that's not
for a dignified person like you.

A roast is for a pig.

I'm not dignified.

<i>It's a celebration,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

<i>And I want you</i>
<i>to be part of it.</i>

Why are you doing this?
Is it for the food?

What is it?

<i>Leonard, it's a roast.</i>

They got a bunch of comedians
nobody's ever heard of.

A few B-level celebrities
I've never met...

Bill.

Some train wreck in a dress
who used to be hot.

Bill, I'm not
gonna do this.

And everybody
makes fun of me.

It's gonna be
so much...fun.

<i>I think.</i>

Billy, let me
tell you something.

You know how much
I love you.

<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

You're like
a brother to me.

<i>I know.</i>

And I consider you
a very important person.

Well, I'm really moved.
I really am.

I really admire what
you've done

<i>with your career.</i>

<i>Are you reading this?</i>

No, I'm talking to you
as a human being, schmuck!

Now, listen to me.

<i>I'm gonna do you</i>
<i>a big favor.</i>

Yeah, what's the favor?

I will not roast you.

Oh, Leonard, come on.
<i>The answer is no.</i>

I care about you
too much, Bill.

Oh, Leonard, I'm--

Bill?
<i>Yeah?</i>

Live long, prosper.

Oh, live long and prosper.

<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I love your family.</i>

<i>Give them all my best.</i>

<i>Oh, I'll do that.</i>
<i>Thank you, Leonard.</i>

<i>You're welcome.</i>
<i>Take care.</i>

Pointy-eared pussy.
Eat my balls.

<i>What?</i>

<i>I'm still on the phone!</i>

Does that mean
you've reconsidered?

Get out of my life!

<i>Douche bag.</i>

I am...T.J. Hooker.
James T. Kirk.

Will you calm down?

Energize.

There's a man out there.

4 Adam 30,
pursuit terminated.

Mr. Tambourine man!

Kahn!

(male announcer)
It's the <i>Comedy Central</i>
<i>Roast of William Shatner.</i>

With your roast master...

And roasters...

And special appearances by...

Fire photon torpedoes.

And now please welcome
tonight's roast master

Jason Alexander!

Thank you.

Tonight,
Comedy Central honors

an Emmy award-winning actor,
a director, an author,

a sportsman, a chef,
an equestrian, a humanitarian,

and if I may say,
a very, very good eater.

I speak of course
of the great William Shatner.

[cheers and applause]

I love William Shatner.

I will repeat that.
I love William Shatner.

I have studied
this man's work

since I was
a little boy.

He is the reason
I became an actor.

I am serious about that.

He's also the reason
I needed so many

frigging years
of acting lessons

to break me out of this style
of only...

talking two...or three words
at a time.

Who the hell...
talks like this?

Unless they're...
constipated?

And trying to take a big...
stinking...crap?

Khan!

I'm sorry, once you start...

William Shatner's career
has lasted over 50 years

in which he's had
an incredible two,

maybe three-year run.

Which, as I do the math,
means there's 47 years of...

Well...let's take a look.

Allow me to
introduce myself,

William J. Baxter,
Louisville, Kentucky.

I'm Joe Conrad.

I am Brandywine Gage.

I'm Denny Crane.

T.J. Hooker is the name.

I'm Captain James. T. Kirk.

[Christina Aguilera's
<i>Ain't No Other Man]</i>

-I'm a legend.
-Right.

â™ª Ain't no other man
can stand â™ª

Scotty, beam us up fast.

Fire.

Lock and load.

â™ª You're the kind of guy
a girl finds â™ª

â™ª In a blue moon

â™ª You got soul
you got class â™ª

â™ª You got style
you're badass â™ª

â™ª Ain't no other man
it's true â™ª

Oh, yes!

â™ª Ain't no other man
but you â™ª

The pale eyes
will die!

[war cry]

[Beastie Boy's
<i>Ch-Check it Out]</i>

â™ª All you Trekkies
and TV addicts â™ª

â™ª Don't mean to dis
don't mean to bring static â™ª

â™ª All you Klingons
in your Grandma's house â™ª

If you could fight
any celebrity,

who would you fight?

I'd fight William Shatner.

Come on!

Caesar of the stars.

Bring me to Octavius.

It's for you, Hooker.

Hooker.
Hooker.

Sorry, Hooker.
I love you, Hooker.

It's the only way, Hooker.

Kahn!

â™ª Everything I do
I do with William Shatner â™ª

Hey, when you've been around
as long as I have,

you get plugged in.

Were you able to jump
on the hood?

Oh, yeah!

You okay there, T.J.?

Dammit!

Aaaah!

I can't believe I kissed you.

Must have been
your lifelong ambition.

Aaah!

So how was
your trip, sir?

I saw something
on the wing of the plane!

â™ª I don't want
to go to work â™ª

â™ª Just wanna hang
with Captain Kirk â™ª

Get a life,
will you people?

â™ª Don't you wish
that you could do it too â™ª

Oh, man, I love it.


Ladies and gentlemen,
I direct your attention

to a very special chair.

A chair that millions
of <i>Star Trek</i> fans

have grown up watching
and dreaming about.

A chair that has
been on display

at the Science Fiction Museum
Hall of Fame in Seattle.

For that is the actual
command chair

<i>of the proudest vessel</i>
<i>ever to sail</i>

<i>in the Starfleet Command,</i>
<i>the</i> USS Enterprise.

And there is only one ass
big enough to fill it!

Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. William Shatner!

â™ª Ride Captain ride
upon your mystery ship â™ª

â™ª Be amazed
at the friends â™ª

â™ª You have there
on your trip â™ª

â™ª Ride captain ride
upon your mystery ship â™ª

â™ª On your way to a world

â™ª That others
might have missed â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª Ride captain ride

Thank you.

â™ª Upon your mystery ship

Now, that's an entrance.

<i>I'm here.</i>

I'm sitting.

Bill, if may say,
that chair fits you

like your girdle
from seasons 2 and 3.

It was just beautiful.

<i>Beautiful.</i>

William Shatner was born
in Montreal, Canada in 1931.

The son of Jewish immigrants.

That's right, folks,
Captain Kirk is a Jew!

Whoo!

L'Chaim, baby!

You got it.

Tell Mel Gibson to shove
that photon torpedo

right up his ass.

[cheers and applause]

But look who else is here
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

The wonderful--where is
he, Mr. Sulu!

Mr. George Takei!

<i>Right there on our dais.</i>

This is the only man
who came out

and had <i>Out</i> magazine say,
"Who asked you?"

Go back.
In, go.

<i>And Lieutenant Uhura,</i>

the lovely Nichelle Nichols
is with us this evening.

Out in the crowd tonight,
we do have

one of your co-stars
from <i>T.J. Hooker.</i>

The wonderful
Adrian Zmed is here.

There he is.

<i>Adrian, wanted to be</i>
<i>on the dais,</i>

but we needed celebrities.

Your other <i>Hooker</i> co-star
Heather Locklear,

the beautiful
Heather Locklear.

She wanted to come tonight.

But she's dating
David Spade now,

and she may never
come again, so...


<i>As for the people</i>
<i>who did</i>

make it here tonight,
we have a veritable...

who's that of comedy.


They all share
one thing in common,

not one of them
has ever met you, Bill.

And I think
that's why they're here.

Because Bill Shatner,
my friends,

is a man who has
millions of fans

all around the world.

All of them who continue
to live with their parents.

<i>And he is loved.</i>

Bill, as we all know,
is an accomplished director.

His masterpiece,
of course,

<i>Star Trek 5:</i>
<i>The Death of a Franchise.</i>

Five.

He's also
a great humanitarian,

ladies and gentlemen.

For charity, this man
sold his own kidney stone

for $75,000.

Most of us
can't be bothered

to sign a picture.

This man
gave a kidney stone.

Next month,
he auctioning off

an anal cyst
for Jerry's Kids,

a benign mole
for Katrina relief,

and two feet
of irritable bowel

for the United Jewish Appeal.
He's a giver!

He is a giver,
ladies and gentlemen.

[cheers and applause]

Bill, you are a powerful,
and unique, and passionate man

in everything you do.

And one of the great joys
in my life

has been in meeting you
and working with you.

No one deserves to be
in that chair

more than you
because no one else

could have made it
such a place of honor.

So do live long
and prosper, my friend.

<i>And enjoy this evening.</i>

Congratulations.

Now let's bring up
the first of many roasters

to rip you
a new asshole.

Which you will no doubt
donate to needy children.

Our first roaster
is here tonight

only because he's Colombian

and Andy Dick
needed the cocaine.

Mr. Greg Giraldo!

Thank you,
Pillsbury Jewboy!

Jason, that was
a refreshing change.

These days,
the only time you're funny

is on a rerun.

<i>You've done--</i>

You've really tried
to hang in there after <i>Seinfeld.</i>

You had shows like
<i>Bob Patterson</i> and <i>Listen Up.</i>

Those shows disappeared faster
than a bowl of Percocet

at Farrah Fawcett's house.

You've been in more turds
than Andy Dick's penis.

Look at his dais.

Fat guys, old ladies,
and an Asian.

I feel like I'm on a bus
to Atlantic City.

Look at this,
Nichelle Nichols,

Farrah Fawcett,
and Betty White.

Uh, I'll take women I would
masturbate to 30 years ago

for $1,000, Alex?

<i>What a--</i>

What a--

What a cruel joke.

Three women you'd want
to fuck 30 years ago

and one I wouldn't fuck
30 beers from now.

Artie Lang, you...

You fat, drunk slob.

Artie, your liver
has more holes in it

than Mel Gibson's apology.

Your liver's so black,
Lisa Lampanelli

tried to get it to
fuck her up the ass

and never call again.

Artie, your pal
George Takei is here.

Sorry to pick on you,
George.

I know it couldn't be easy
being a gay Japanese man

in the '50s.

I mean, it had to be
almost impossible

to pronounce "glory hole"
with a Japanese accent.

<i>George, you'll be</i>
<i>happy to know</i>

<i>that Jeff Ross is here.</i>

Jeff is such
a huge asshole,

you won't have to
spit on your dick first.

To our guest of honor now,

the great William Shatner,
everybody.

<i>Hi William.</i>

Bill, it's uh--

That was quite an entrance.

When I heard someone
was gonna come on a horse,

I thought, "Wow, the network's
really gonna let Andy Dick

and Lisa Lampanelli
get away with murder."

You're the horse!

Bill, you're not
just brilliant

and old and fat.

You're--you're
an inspiration.

You proved that
having no talent

can be seen as hip
and ironic.

You overact more than
Betty White's bladder.

<i>Wow.</i>
<i>Then, uh--</i>

Then, of course,
there was <i>T.J. Hooker.</i>

The only thing I remember
about that show

was your hair and that
hot chick what's-her-face,

Adrian Zmed.

What, uh--

<i>What happened to her?</i>

You're a humanitarian.

You work with a foundation
to bring peace

to the Middle East.

And whatever it is
you're doing, keep it up.

<i>'Cause it's really working.</i>

It's really working.

[cheers and applause]

You know, Bill, one of the most
surreal parts of this business

is that I get to stand here

and make fun
of a legend like you.

You were an enormous part
of my youth

and you made Captain Kirk
larger than life.

And really, honestly
no actor who's ever lived

could have done more
with that role.

And the fact that you
continue to crank out

the best work
you've done today,

when statistically,
you should be dead,

is really really inspiring.
Thank you very much.

[cheers and applause]

This--this is a fight
to the death.

Coming up, on the
<i>Roast of William Shatner...</i>

People insult you.

Betty White...
They wanna make fun of me.

Jeff Ross.
They're beasts.

Farrah Fawcett.

Just gonna be awful.

And Lisa Lampanelli.

I expect no quarter,
and I'm giving none.

Our next guest
is the only person

on this stage
who has fucked

all four of
the Marx Brothers.

Ms. Betty White,
ladies and gentlemen!

â™ª Oh, no, not I

â™ª I will survive

â™ª Oh, as long as
I know how to love â™ª

â™ª I know I'm still alive

â™ª I've got
all my life to live â™ª

Oh, thank you.

Oh!

And thank you
so very much and good night.

Oh, Jason Alexander,
you are such a treat.

You know, I was expecting you
to be just dreadful.

Well, in all fairness,

I was basing that on everything
you've ever done, but--

But isn't this
just wonderful?

I mean,
all you youngsters

getting together
to tell naughty jokes.

Oh.

It's like the great roasts
I went to

in the good old days.

Of course,
you wouldn't have been

allowed in, Nichelle.

<i>Sorry.</i>

Oh, we had our fun.

You know, I've been
a huge Trekkie

ever since
the show first aired.

And that's why
I'm so thrilled to see Nichelle

and George Takei here tonight.

'Cause, let's face it--

we all know Shatner's nuts.

But George has actually
tasted them.

Whoo!

Oh, it always
makes me laugh

when I see Artie Lang
onstage,

knowing I'm gonna
outlive him.

<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

No.

Oh, but you know
who I love.

Look at that Patton Oswalt.

<i>So adorable.</i>

He's like
a plump little troll.

Backstage I caught him
going up on Farrah Fawcett.

Oh, Farrah, you know
I don't mean any of this.

<i>I feel such a special</i>
<i>connection to you, Farrah.</i>

I'm in my 80s,

and that's the last decade
you mattered.

And who else
is here tonight?

Uh, where's Spock?

And James Spader?

And Bones and Scotty
and...

Oh, Bill,
all your friends

are either dead
or they hate you.

To be fair, I'm a little
of column A

and a little
of column B.

But you look great.

You know, they make
1% milk now.

Darling,
you were supposed to

explore the galaxy.

Not fill it.

All joking aside,

Bill can be
quite a charmer.

I'm not ashamed to say

that I once
had sex with Bill Shatner.


Oh, you should have seen him
sweating and grunting

and so red in the face
and wheezing.

Finally, I said, "Bill,
you better hurry up and finish.

In two minutes, they're
gonna start the roast."

Of course,
I'm still joking.

Bill is
a happily married man.

I caught the bouquet
at Bill's wedding.

And I hope I'm still around
to catch the cock ring

at Sulu's.

Bill, the truth is,
I dearly love you.

I've always admired you
as an actor.

I think you're funny
and smart and kind.

And I was so excited
when I found out

I'd be working with you
on <i>Boston Legal.</i>

Till I worked with you
on <i>Boston Legal.</i>

Good night!

Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

the roastmaster general,
Mr. Jeffrey Ross!

All right.

Thank you, Artie.

Artie's here just to
finish people's drinks.


<i>That's good, you're like</i>
<i>the Chris Farley</i>

<i>of satellite radio.</i>


Jason Alexander.

<i>Sir.</i>

You clearly come from
the planet Trying-too-hard.


You sing, you dance,
you act.

You do everything
but make people laugh.

But I did love you in
<i>March of the Penguins.</i>

Yeah!

<i>As many of you know,</i>

last year Comedy Central
threw a very successful roast

of Pamela Anderson.

And this year, in keeping
with that tradition,

we're roasting another
bad actor with big tits.

Look at you!

Look at you, Shatner.

You have let yourself
boldly go.

When did you go
from Captain Kirk

to Captain Crunch?

You left <i>T.J. Hooker</i>
and went to P.F. Chang's!

You work at <i>Boston Legal</i>
or Boston Market?

If Scotty tried to
beam you up now,

you'd break
the fucking transporter.

But I must admit I am
the world's biggest

<i>Star Trek</i> fan.

I've seen every episode
a million times.

And I always wished
just once...

Just once
that spaceship of yours

would land on a planet
with an acting school.

You sound like
you forgot...

your fucking...
lines.

And now you play a guy
with Alzheimer's?

That's a fucking
lucky break, huh?

<i>Hey, if ain't broke,</i>

don't fix it,
you know what I'm saying?

But seriously, this is
such a huge honor for me

to be roasting the spokesman
for priceline.com.

Who we roasting next year,
the Travelocity gnome?

What happened, we couldn't
get the lizard from GEICO

up in this motherfucker?

Anyway, speaking of Shatner,

Betty White
just shat in her pants.

All right, Farrah Fawcett,
let's face it.

Farrah, the truth is
my whole life

I had that poster of you.

And as a kid
I would always

masturbate to it,
hoping that I wouldn't go blind.

And now that
I see you in person...

What the fuck?
It's a roast!

<i>Betty White, can you</i>
<i>explain the jokes</i>

to Farrah, please?

After last year's roast,

Andy Dick
kissed my girlfriend's hand.

40 minutes later,
she was dead.

Andy Dick's
sole mission in life

is to give AIDS
back to the monkeys.

No, the truth is,
Mr. Shatner,

growing up I always
had a strong distrust

for both Klingons
and Puerto Ricans.

But watching <i>Star Trek</i>
taught me

it doesn't matter
whether you're black or white

or blue or green

or an old washed-up bag
like Betty White.

We all want
the same things in life

and that's to live long
and prosper.

I love you, man.

Nanu Nanu.

Coming up, Artie Lang,

Fred Willard,

and Sandra Bullock.

Hi, I'm Sandra Bullock.

And I worked with
William Shatner

on the <i>Miss Congeniality</i>
movies.

You know,
I think it is so great

that everyone got together
to salute Bill

and have some laughs
at his expense.

But, you know,
please, please don't be too mean

to him tonight.

'Cause the truth is,
Bill is a nice, sweet...

kindhearted old man.

And it's really not cool
to make fun of the elderly

and the feeble.

And the incontinent.

And everything else
that Bill is.

Just, you know,
just try to be sensitive

to how it must feel
to be so close to death

and addlebrained.

I mean, half the time
on the set of

<i>Miss Congeniality...</i>

Wow.
This is hard..

Bill thought he was
on the deck

of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

And...for some reason,
he'd walk up behind me

and he'd cup my buttocks
with his hands

and call me Sulu.

And each day at 2:30,

he had to go back
to his trailer

with his nurse, who was
this really nice guy

named Darnell,
for a medical procedure

known as
milking the prostate.

And I can't begin to imagine
how uncomfortable

that was for Bill.

Because Darnell had
what could only be described

as these, like,
penis-sized fingers.

You know, and Bill,
he's just...

He faces each of
these challenges

with dignity
and good humor.

So...again,

just go easy
on the old coot.

Thank you.

Our next guest,
ladies and gentlemen,

is multi-talented.

He can black out
and shit his pants

all at the same time,
Mr. Artie Lange!

What's up?

Anybody else drinking
or wha--?

Jason Alexander, my man.

How you doing?

Jason is a committed actor.

Jason went from doing a show
about nothing

to actually doing nothing.

What do you say to someone
who played an icon?

Someone who played a character
in science fiction history

that was one of the best ever,

and then gains a lot of weight
and becomes embarrassing?

You say, "What happened,
Carrie Fisher?"

George Takei is here,
my friend

from <i>The Howard Stern Show.</i>

The great George Takei.

I'm friends with George
and we've hung out before.

It's hard hanging out
with a gay guy all day,

because you always feel like
you have to adjust

the conversation so they
can relate to it, you know?

Like with George,
I go,

"So, George, I was
watching the Super Bowl--

I mean sucking cock."

Andy, good to see
you're doing well.

<i>A few years ago,</i>
<i>Andy was loaded</i>

while he was driving his car
and he rammed into a pole.

This is a big turnaround
for Andy,

'cause usually
when he's loaded

a pole is getting rammed
into him.

Lisa Lampanelli, my friend.

Lisa, you're an overweight,
annoying female comic.

You're seven horrible
movies away from

being Janeane Garofalo.

A lot of people might say,
"Art, why hit Janeane?

She's not here
to defend herself."

And the answer is simple.

I've met Jeanine Garofalo,
and she's a fucking cunt.

Kevin Pollak's here.

Kevin's here 'cause he just does
every hacky impression

in the world.

You're not gonna
see him again

unless Comedy Central
roasts Peter Falk.


But William Shatner's here.

Let's get to
the great William Shatner.

Bill, I hate to say it,
but I was never

a <i>Star Trek</i> fan.

When I was a kid,
I had weird interests

like football, baseball,
chasing pussy.

Bill and I
have a lot in common.

Bill was on <i>T.J. Hooker,</i>

and I once banged a hooker
named T.J.

Shatner's a hero to a legion
of <i>Star Trek</i> fans.

What do they
call themselves again?

Oh, yeah, queers.

And Trekkies are not
the best with women.

Shatner's responsible
for more people

not getting laid
than impotence.

But, Bill, listen,
I love ya.

This is the part where we're
supposed to say thank you.

You're on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i>
quite a bit,

and we love having you there.

And I say this
from the bottom of my heart,

go fuck yourself.

<i>Salut.</i>

Bill Shatner, uh, you are
one of our greatest actors.

And I think I'm quoting you
correctly there, am I?

You--you are a legend.

And again, I hate to be
a nitpicker,

but you misspelled
legend here.

<i>It's L-E-G--</i>

Good evening, Bill.

Of course, in the famous
1968 episode of <i>Star Trek,</i>

Billy boy and I shared

an on-screen kiss
that made history.

<i>And I'll never forget</i>

what Bill said to me
after that kiss.

Eh, Sulu...uses...
more...tongue.


Now, Bill, what do you say?

Let's make a little more
TV history.


And kiss my black ass.


Coming up...

William Shatner
is not his real name.

Andy Dick.

You'll know more later.

Farrah Fawcett and Ben Stiller.

Hey, Bill.
Ben Stiller here.

I got a call about
your big roast tonight.

And they asked me if could
make some time to stop by.

And you know what?
No, I can't.

Too busy.
Know why?

Because in 1975,
you didn't make the time

to send me the autographed
Captain Kirk picture

that I wrote
and politely asked for.

Instead, you sent me
this letter.

Which I saved.

And really actually
had a very...

Very big impact on me.

"Dear Ben Shit-for-brains,

nice fucking letter,
dick lick."

I was ten.

<i>"I assume you wrote me</i>
<i>for an autograph,</i>

"but I'm not sure
because I can't read

"one word of
your chicken scratch.

"Did you stick that crayon
in your ass

and squat over the page?"

How drunk were you
when you wrote this letter?

Huh?
In that hotel room?

Surrounded by whores
and pills.

And all the bad thoughts
that just couldn't be

washed away by any
mind-altering substance.

"Why don't you go grab
dad's crowbar

"and pop your head
out of your ass

and check out my new show
<i>Barbary Coast."</i>

Oh, that was a gem.

"It's about action
and adventure

"in Old West San Francisco,
which is the perfect town

"for a mincy little tea bag
like you.

"Or better yet, save a stamp
and call up George Takei.

"It would make his day
knowing

"that a 10-year-old boy
wants some photos from him.

"And I'm sure he'd want
some of you right back.

"Warmest regards,
Bill Shatner.

CC: Gene Roddenberry."

You know what, Bill?

I did contact Mr. Takei.
Yeah.

And he invited me over
to his place.

And then he told me his lap
was a transporter

and it would beam me
to heaven.

So that worked out great
for me.

Um...

Shame on you, Sulu.

Yeah, I know you're there.

Shame on you.

Don't look around,
'cause it's right here.

And it's never
going away.

Um, seriously, Bill,
have a great night.

You've always been
a hero of mine.

I'm a huge fan.

And in words of
one <i>Enterprise</i> crew member

who doesn't wear a girdle,

live long and prosper.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Farrah Fawcett
is here tonight.

And she's here for
a very special reason.

She lives under the stage.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Farrah Fawcett!

Wow.


I don't think
I can do this.

Jason, can you
come back up here please?

I'm--sorry,
I changed my mind.

I--I can't do this.

What, you...

I just--I can't be mean
to people.

Oh, Farrah, it's easy.
Roasting someone is easy.

You just look 'em
in the eye

and you say something mean
about them.

Like you're bald?

Yeah, not me.
Not me.

And beady-eyed.

No, Farrah, not me.
Not me.

Now, listen, no, you're supposed
to go after Bill.

Go after Bill.

But I...

I was always told
that if you can't

say anything nice...

don't say anything at all.
Really?

Well...

Well, okay, there was
one strange moment.

All right.

I was going into
the ladies' room,

Bill was coming out,
and I said,

"Bill, what were you
doing in there?

And why are you looking
so bloated tonight?"

And he said,
"My name's not Bill,

it's Lisa Lamanetti.
Lam...

Oh, Lampanelli!
Yes!

Yes.

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>(Farrah)</i>
<i>I'm so s...I can't...</i>

<i>(Jason)</i>
<i>No, you know what?</i>

She was probably
so crocked at the time,

she said "Lamanelli"
and, uh, yes.

No, no, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sure
that's what she said.

Lampanelli.
Wow.

Sorry.

I'm good, aren't I?

Yes, yes!
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

You're having fun, right?

Yeah, I probably won't
remember any of it.

That's right.
Tomorrow.

No, I'm glad that you
got me to stay.

It is my pleasure.
I'm glad you're here.

Yeah.
I did it for you.

Of course.
Yeah.

And all jokes aside,
I really think that

you're wonderful.
I do.

And you and I
have a lot in common.

We were both known
for our hair.

And our boobs.

And we both
fucked Lee Majors.

But, Bill, what I really...
and I do, appreciate,

is your singing.

I loved your last CD,
<i>Has Been,</i>

which was
originally titled

<i>Has Been See...</i>

<i>Has Been...</i>
Okay.

<i>Has Been--</i>
Okay.

<i>Do it again!</i>
Okay!

I really loved your CD.

It was originally titled...

Okay, I'm not on anything.
I mean it.

Now, stop it right now.

I can do this on the natch.
On the natch.

Okay, I loved
your last CD.

Which was originally titled
<i>Has Been Drinking Since Noon.</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>There you go.</i>

Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

With your permission,

I think we should
show some clips

of your so-called
singing career performances.

Okay?

I do love you.

She packed my bags...

last night, pre-flight.

Zero hour.
9:00 AM.

And I'm gonna be...
high...

as a kite by then.

â™ª Keep it gay, keep it light
Keep it fresh, keep it fair â™ª

â™ª Let it bloom every night
Give it room â™ª

Never stand still,
keep it moving.

â™ª Keep your love
a lovely dream â™ª

â™ª And never wake it

Come on, Mike.
â™ª Keep it gay, keep it gay

â™ª Keep it gay

â™ª Keep it gay, keep it gay,
Keep it gay â™ª

Rocket man.

Burning out his fuse
out here...alone.

I think it's gonna be
a long, long time

till touchdown
bring me round again and find

I'm not the man
they think I am at home.

Oh, no, no, no.

I'm a rocket man.

â™ª I go flying so high
when I'm stoned â™ª

â™ª When I'm stoned

â™ª And I think it's gonna be
a long long time â™ª

â™ª Till touchdown brings me
round again to find â™ª

â™ª I'm not the man
they think I am at home â™ª

â™ª Oh, no, no, no

I'm a rock it man.

Rocket man.

Burnin' out his fuse
out here alone.

Mr. Tambourine man.

In a jingle...
jangle mornin'...

I'll come following you.

Hey.

Hey, Mr. Tambourine man.

Mr. Tambourine man.

Mr. Tambourine man.

Mr. Tambourine man!

I took off
the Andy Dick costume,

and I got more comfortable.

My real true name
is Andy Kock.

That's Kock with a K.

It's actually a combination
of two names,

Kirk and Spock.

<i>Confused?</i>

I brought
a little something

that just might
shed some light.

The actual Captain's Log.

"I was just exiting
the shower tonight

"when Spock
entered my quarters.

"He stared at me hungrily.

"Like Lieutenant Uhura
eyeing a plate of ribs."

"I said, 'Spock!

'Why aren't you...
manning... your post?'"

That's the best
I can do.

"'Captain, when was
the last time

you had your
bunghole vulcanized?'"

"He mounted me.

"Boldly going where only...

a few guys back in college
had gone before."

"For a being
with no emotions,

"his meat hammer
sure seemed to be

angry with my butt."

<i>"Spock did give me</i>
<i>the reach around.</i>

Or as he called it,
the Vulcan taint pinch."

"Then he fired off
his photon torpedoes

deep inside my worm hole."

Ladies and gentlemen,

our...

guest of honor...

was impregnated.

I am the illegitimate
butt baby

of Kirk and Spock.

Kock!

And, Mom?

Even though
you abandoned me,

I...I love you.

And congratulations
on your big night.

Coming up, Patton Oswalt.

All right, sit down,
Courtney!

Seriously, please--
oh, God!

You know, I just wanna
stop the show

for a second
to say something.

Lisa, I am glad
you're here.

<i>Last year Lisa Lampanelli</i>
<i>had a polyp</i>

removed from her colon.

And now I'd like to
introduce that polyp,

Patton Oswalt,
ladies and gentlemen!

I'm here
to talk about...

William Shatner.

Listen to that name.
Shatner!

Shatner sounds like

the barbaric yawp
of a Viking's cock

as it splits a mighty elm
into kindling

that you build
a roaring bonfire

and then cook meat over
that you fill your belly with

after you ass rape
an ice giant.

That's what your name
sounds like.

By the way, Andy, I saw that
new Jessica Simpson video.

The one where
you lick the roller skate?

I never thought I'd feel bad
for a roller skate.

<i>What the...</i>

All right,
sit down, Courtney.

Seriously, please.
Oh, God.

Oh, Jesus Christ!

Wow!

See you in ten years,
erections.

Cable Ace nominee
Kevin Pollak,

ladies and gentlemen,
right over there.

<i>Used to, uh...</i>

Former host of
<i>Celebrity Poker Showdown.</i>

How the fuck do you
get fired from a job

where all you gotta do
is say, "Nice fold, Coolio"?

How does that happen?

Good God.

Carrie Fisher.

Carrie Fisher,
ladies and gentlemen.

As a nerd,

<i>you really are...</i>

In that gold bikini
in <i>Return of the Jedi.</i>

Jesus God in heaven.

Wow!

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Oh, jeez.</i>

You just got a kiss
from Jabba the fag.

You are so... so good
in that gold bikini.

And then what happened?

When they yelled "cut"
did you have

a Vicodin-eating contest
with Chewbacca?

Take it from a nerd,
let the wookie win, okay?

I feel very good
about that joke

because the message board
I tried it out on

gave me an LMFAOW...

uh, IHAP, uh, FEF...
um...

AAMM, uh, IMD,

um, YAMIRDMR, uh...FBNA,

which as Brian Posehn'll
tell you means

Laughing
My Figurative Ass Off

While I Have
a Boba Fett Action Figure

In My Real Ass
and My Mom Yells at Me

to Turn Down my Rush
<i>Fly By Night</i> Album.

George Takei
came out of the closet.

By the way, when you
came out of the closet,

did the door go...
<i>[Enterprise</i> door sound]

<i>when that happened?</i>

Farrah Fawcett,
you look so hot tonight.

I'm serious, you are
so smoking hot.

You really are.

Although, keep in mind,

batshit crazy
gives me a boner, so...

Although--what the...

Why do I feel like
Courtney Love

killed Andy Dick
and put his skin on?

Lisa Lampanelli.

The queen of mean.

Or as the kids call you,
the insult comic dog.

Lisa Lampanelli has fucked
more black men

than the Tuskegee experiments.

Don't groan at that,
she does very well.

Do you know how much bling
gets left in Lisa's snatch?

<i>It's like a pawn show</i>
<i>down there.</i>

Yesterday Carlos Mencia
tried to rob it.

Luckily, he passed out
from the smell.

William, look--

I didn't really pick
on you that much.

As a nerd, it really
is a big deal

for me to be up here.

It's hard for me to write
anything mean about you.

This means a lot to me.

I'm gonna go now.

But before I leave,

just settle a bet
for me and my friends.

Could you, uh...

Could you act your way out
of this for me really quick?

<i>No?</i>

Folks, thank you very much.

And thank you,
William Shatner.

Coming up, George Takei

and Lisa Lampanelli.

I thought you dated Lance.

They say behind every
great man is a great woman.

Unless you're our next guest.

Behind him is another
creepy old gay dude.

George Takei,
ladies and gentlemen!

Georgie!

I've got a few things to say
about this bloated,

washed up, pathetic,
no talent, bald hack.

Jason, great job tonight.

And a great job
last night too.

[clears throat]

Look at all the talent
we have in this room tonight.

Farrah Fawcett, Betty White,

Lisa Lampanelli.

It smells like pussy
in here.

I think.

Andy Dick is here tonight.

As a fellow gay man,

<i>even I have to say</i>

Andy, tone it down a little.

And I have to say
a special hello

to my cuddly muffin,
Artie Lange.

Speaking of fat alcoholics...

Good evening, Bill.

My name is George Takei.

Not <i>Tak"eye",</i> as you've insisted
on pronouncing it

for the last 40 years.

Remember--Takei,
like in toupee.

<i>All night long,</i>

I've had to stare at that
tangled, sticky, messy

clump of fur.

Farrah, please
close your legs!


Oh, no.

Oh, no.

At least Betty White
had the decency to shave.

Bill, there are
so many things about you

that I can make fun of.

Like your...acting.

Your acting is the only thing
that makes me want to gag.

<i>If I could only get my partner</i>

to suck that hard,
I'd never leave my chateau.

Of course,
I'm only kidding, Bill.

Bill is a generous actor.

He gave Nichelle Nichols
herpes.

[George laughs]

Ladies and gentlemen,

the first--
Give me a kiss.

But if Artie's
my cuddly muffin, Bill,

you are a rich, gooey
Devil's food cake

that I want to drop my face
into and go...

[makes raspberry sounds]

So...

despite our tensions,

I am honored that
you invited me

to be here with you tonight.

I can finally say what I've
waited 40 years to say.

Fuck you,
and the horse you rode in on!

Good night.

Coming up, Lisa Lampanelli
and William Shatner.

Be kind.

If you can't be kind,
be lousy.

Our final roaster gave up
a promising football career

to become a horrible comedian.

<i>So many black guys</i>

have been inside this woman,
she calls her pussy

"Roscoe's House of
Chicken and Waffles."

Lisa Lampanelli!

â™ª She's a brick house

Oh, thank you!

Come on, clap it up
for Jason Alexander.

Come on, Mr. Potato Head.

I like you, Jason Alexander.

I find you sexy.
I'd make out with you.

Kiss me, you fat fag.

I've always wanted to see

what Jerry Seinfield's
cock tastes like.

We are here tonight to honor

show business legend
William Shatner.

[cheers and applause]
<i>As you all know,</i>

William Shatner
is an author too.

I've read your writing.

It sucks out loud.

Put it this way.

Your next project should be
a suicide note.

I'm kidding,
William Shatner.

Don't kill yourself.

Then Uhura over there

won't have anyone's house
to clean.

I kid.
I love you, Nichelle.

Or as they called you
on the <i>Enterprise--</i>

Mammy.

William Shatner is
not only a TV star

and a "writer."

As a singer,
he is beyond compare.

It's true.

When Elton John heard
William Shatner sing <i>Rocket Man,</i>

he spit George Takei's dick
out of his mouth.

<i>Being Japanese and gay isn't</i>
<i>all bad, right, George?</i>

It has it's benefits.

You can bow down to say hello

and take it in the ass
at the same time.

But enough about the Chinaman.

Jeff Ross is so unlikable
that on myspace

even Tom
won't be his friend.

Sorry for all the salty
language tonight, Betty White.

Betty White is a class act.

A real lady.

It's true!

Betty White is so old

that on her first game show
ever,

the grand prize was fire.

[cheers and applause]

Don't you laugh
at no elderly jokes, Shatner.

<i>You're 75.</i>

William Shatner's ball bag
hangs so low,

he has to hold it
when he takes a shit.

How does anyone that mediocre
get to be in that many movies?

Seriously, Kevin Pollak,
how does that happen?

Speaking of things that blow,

hi, Andy Dick.

<i>Andy Dick is so gay,</i>

his Chapstick
is cock flavored.

Andy Dick is so gay,
he thinks Margaret Cho is funny.


But enough
about this poo pusher.

Tonight William Shatner
is our guest of honor.

Mr. Shatner has starred in some
amazing television shows.

<i>T.J. Hooker</i> was not
one of them.

What a piece of crap.

I tried to TiVo <i>T.J Hooker,</i>

but my TiVo suggested
I punch myself in the cunt.

In closing, I would like
to thank you, William Shatner,

for letting me
make fun of you tonight.

You are an icon
who is loved the world over.

And you're an inspiration
to performers everywhere.

William Shatner
is living proof

that if you are talented
and nice,

you can work forever
in this business.

Luckily for me,
if you're neither--

pffft, fuck it.

You can still be
on Comedy Central.

Thank you, William Shatner.
I love you very much.

[cheers and applause]

Up next, are you ready
for some Shatner?

Nobody's ever ready.

Go to comedycentral.com
for uncensored clips

and exclusive
red carpet footage.

And now, ladies and gentlemen,

the only person on this stage
who's actually employed.

A man who is
a national treasure.

In Canada.

A man...with balls
the size of...

well, giant old man balls.

<i>Captain, my captain.</i>

It's time to address your crew!

The man of the hour,
Mr. William Shatner!

[Elton John's <i>Rocket Man]</i>

â™ª

<i>Oh, my.</i>

â™ª And I think it's gonna be
a long, long time â™ª

Oh, wow.

Oh, my God.

No, it was bad.

It was bad as I thought
it was gonna be.

Painful. Painful.

How's the hair?

The hair is good?
The hair is good, okay.

Oh--thank you so much.
I appreciate that.

The only thing that really, uh,
hurts my feelings about tonight

is that you people
just weren't funny.


And I gave you so much
to work with.

You could've said
something like,

"Shatner's such a cheap Jew,
he only beamed himself up

after 7:00 when the rates
are lower."

See, that's funny.

That's why I have a level
of success.

Success that, based on
what I've seen tonight,

none of you will
ever achieve, all right?

Well, unless Lisa Lampanelli
wins the Kentucky Derby,

then you have success.

<i>George, Nichelle,</i>

<i>it's really great to see you.</i>

Because of our work together

on the bridge
of the fabled <i>Enterprise,</i>

it broke a lot of stereotypes.

Not only did we take a chance

and allow an Asian gentleman
to drive...


<i>We--</i>

We had a black woman sitting
in front of a large screen

who didn't yell things at it.

<i>George, I had no idea</i>

it would be so rough
on you tonight.

They really ripped you
a new one.

I'm sure you'll find use
for it though.

The guy's been trying
to suck my cock for 40 years.

George, for the last time,

I will not let you
suck my cock!

And Nichelle,
thank you very much.

And Greg Giraldo,
you don't matter.

You're inconsequential.

<i>You're nothing</i>
<i>but a faceless drone.</i>

If this were an episode
of <i>Star Trek,</i>

you'd be wearing a red shirt
and would've been killed by now.

[cheers and applause]

Kevin Pollak.

I'm glad my vast talents

have been able
to make you rich.

You've got more out of doing me

than any woman
I've ever slept with.

And that includes your wife!

So good for you.

Fred Willard, I've been watching
your career for many years

<i>and I can honestly say,</i>

I don't get it.

You're just so dry.

If you were any drier, you'd be
in Betty White's underwear.

[audience groaning]

And of course,
Farrah Fawcett is here.

<i>And I think it's time</i>
<i>someone told her.</i>

Farrah's a wonderful actress.

She did that great movie
<i>The Burning Bed.</i>

Not to be confused
with Andy Dick's project,

<i>The Burning Butt.</i>

Which has been showcased
in clinics

throughout
Los Angeles and Tijuana.

And speaking of donkeys--

Get 'em, Shatner.

Lisa...

you are one
supremely funny lady.

[cheers and applause]

But you'd be a--
a much better performer

if every time you got on a roll,
you didn't stop to eat it.

Which brings me...

to our host, Jason Alexander.
Thank you so much.

Your work here is done,
my friend.

Jason said
he was inspired by me.

Why is everyone
who's inspired by me

such a fat fucking loser,
I don't know.

You know, I look back
on this amazing evening,

I can't help
but think to myself,

"Who the hell are you people?

Where do you get the nerve
to make fun of me?

What have you ever done?"

Do you know who I am?

I'm William Tiberius Shatner.

[cheers and applause]

Damn right.

I've saved the universe
hundreds of times!

I've created characters that
will stand the test of time.

I've been to space!

<i>[Star Trek</i> theme music]
The final frontier.

These are the voyages
on the starship <i>Enterprise.</i>

The five-year mission:

to seek out new life
and new civilizations.

To boldly go where no man
has gone before!

Home to whack off
to Lisa Lampanelli.

Good night!

It might work.

There's three black guys

Like this shit
ain't stolen.

Yeah, I'm sorry, Bill.
They made me do it.

Thank you.

I took it like a man.

If anybody needs

he should apologize

Piece of crap.
I never liked them.

Thank you!
I'll see you outside.
