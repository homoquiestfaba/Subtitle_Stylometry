Paging Doctor

Paging Doctor line two.

Morning Ms. Dallman.

I'm Brad Steiner.

I've been assigned as your attorney.

I'm a straight forward man, Ms. Dallman,

so let's just get right to it.

Tell me what happened.

Ms. Dallman.

Ms. Dallman.

Hettie, is it?

Hettie, what you tell me
is in total confidence.

Reports state that you entered the room

at approximately 5:30 in the morning.

You shot your father in
the left side of his head,

and then you shot your mother in the face

with the bullet entering
through her right eye.

The arresting officer
found you covered in blood,

on their bedroom floor, holding
the alleged murder weapon.

Hey, you gotta to talk to me.

Let's see.

You are 36 years old, no job, no husband,

and no means to support yourself.

Hettie, let me tell
you how the prosecution

is gonna be spinning this.

You're the sole beneficiary

on your parent's insurance policy,

and you're in a ton of debt.

Classic clichÃ©.

But if it walks like a
duck, quacks like a duck.

You see where I'm going with this?

You gotta give me something
to work with, Hettie.

Hey Brad.

What hole did you crawl out of

that I haven't seen you in forever?

Get me off
the damn speaker phone.

So cranky so early.

It's the only way I know how to be.

Anyway, you know how I hate those things.

Yeah, so?

So I wanna get your
thoughts on something.

All right.

I got a doozy of a case handed to me.

A woman killed both her parents.

Your defense on this?

Sorry, allegedly
killed both her parents.

And?

Well, I had a meeting with her,

and I gotta tell you she's hard as steel.

She wouldn't say a word to me.

What do you think, is malingering?

That she's trying
to get an insanity plea?

I don't know.

There's no doubt the DA
think she's faking though.

Brad, you're a gem.

This is perfect timing.

It's exactly what I needed.

Abby, I haven't even asked you yet.

So ask me.

I need you on this.

Will you please take on this client,

and do a full psych eval?

I would be honored.

Good morning, Ms. Dallman.
I'm Dr. Abigail Williams,

and I'll be meeting with you
for the next couple of weeks.

Before we get started,

I just need you to fill
out one of these forms.

This gives the courts
access to our sessions,

and then we can begin.

Hettie?

Do you mind if I call you Hettie?

These forms are just for formality.

This will let the court determine

if you're competent enough to stand trial.

Hettie, do you understand why you're here?

Hettie, you're gonna have to
talk to me so I can help you.

Thank you.

I will be recording our sessions.

So Hettie, do you
understand why you're here?

Do you understand the charges against you?

You've been charged with
the murder of your parents,

A Mrs. Ellie Dallman,
and Mr. Samuel Dallman.

Hey, Abs, you home?

So this is what it has come to?

What are you doing, I
am on a deadline here.

Are you even willing to work on us?

Do you know what'll happen
if I miss another deadline?

I'm not doing this right now.

I'm tired of this.

Now, you won't even talk to me.

I'm tired of the same
conversation, Martin.

It's the same thing
over and over with you.

It's not even a conversation.

You won't open it up to discussion.
I don't get a vote, a say?

A baby is not gonna fix this.

Me having a child is not gonna
fix what's wrong with us.

Then what will, Abby?

What will?

More work?

Shut up?

She's a bit of a challenge.

You knew that.

That's why I called in the best, right?

I just need to find a
different approach, that's all.

Be careful what you wish for.

What?

Perfect closing case for the book?

What is her background again?

She's a bit of a loner,
single, can't hold down a job.

really.

There must've been a trigger.

There had to have been.

You said her parents were asleep, right?

Yeah.

Okay, was there an
argument earlier that day?

And you think that's what made her snap?

Something did.

Apparently.

No, I mean, there was
something either said

or done to trigger her actions.

I mean, she had plenty of
opportunities to kill them.

Why now?

You know, it might've been the obvious.

I don't buy it.

I don't think she did
it just for the money.

You'd be surprised what people would do

just for the money.

Anyway, I know you'll figure it out, Abs.

Hello?

Yeah, yeah, I sent the
paperwork in yesterday.

Yeah, well did you check spam folder?

Paging Dr. Moore, line two.

Paging Dr. Moore, line two.

What are these papers telling me?

Well, you're here for a reason,

so you gotta fight this.

Get me outta here.

I can only do so much.

Oh my gosh.

Hey, it's me,

your cousin, Felicia.

They treating you okay in here?

God, I haven't seen you in so long.

Didn't imagine it would be like this.

These chairs are so hard.

They could at least have
better chairs in here.

Why didn't you talk to me, Hettie?

I wanna to show you something.

I found these at the thrift store.

Reminded me of us when we were kids.

I remembered how you always had these.

No. No.

Hettie.

No. No.

Calm down. Don't hurt her.

Calm down, Hettie.

Hettie.

Don't hurt her.

Hettie, calm down.

Hettie.

Hettie.

Hettie.

Good morning, Hettie.

I'd like to continue
our conversation today.

Hettie, do you understand
that you have been charged

with the alleged murder
of both your parents?

Not alleged.

Okay, you're stating that you-

I killed them.

Okay, tell me why you think that.

Did you fire the gun?

Hettie, now is the time to tell your side.

Was this an accident?

Was this on purpose?

This wasn't an accident, was it?

You thought they deserve to die.

Why?

They were asleep in their bed.

Shut up.

This wasn't self-defense.

They were defenseless.

Stop talking.

No, we're okay.

I know this is hard, but
you have to face this.

Please, sit down.

You think you know me, don't you?

You got what you wanted.

So just do what you gotta do.

Hettie, you know where this
leads if you're found guilty.

Tell your side of it.

Leave your family with some closure.

We don't talk about
those things in my family.

What things, Hettie?

Hettie.

Hey pop, where's everybody going?

We're all going south.

Ground hog's day, a
terrible blizzard is coming.

Go on, that
guy don't know his shadow

from a hole in the ground

You'll freeze to
death if you stay here

And you won't
have a any food either.

Don't worry about me,
I got plenty of food

and right now I'm going swimming

Mrs. Dallman.

I'm Mrs. Dallman.

I'm Ms. Horne, Hettie's teacher.

Sorry to bother you.

May I come in?

Yes. Well, I guess.

Thank you.

What's going on with Hettie?

Hi, Hettie.

Beautiful home here Mrs. Dallman.

Thank you, and call me Ellie.

Can I get you something?

Some water, tea?

No, thank you. I'm fine.

You'll excuse me, Ms. Horne.

I'm a bit busy.

What is it?

Well, during recess today,
Hettie stuck her classmate,

Rita with a stick.

I'm sorry, Ms. Horne.

You came all the way over here for this?

Kids hit and poke each other all the time.

Can't you handle it?

Yes, Mrs. Dallman, I understand, but-

Ellie.

Ellie.

Hettie, go up to your room.

Ms. Horne, I am not the
least bit amused here.

I've got to get dinner
on the table tonight

before my husband go to work.

Now, what is going on?

Hettie's father is in the home?

What are you talking about?

Of course, he is.

You another one of them

that don't think our men stay in home.

No, Ellie. I didn't-

Mrs. Dallman.

Ms. Dallman, I didn't...

Look, I didn't mean it that way.

It's just the nature of Hettie's behavior

and where she poked the
girl, it suggests that...

Well, it's suggest that
there may be abuse.

What are you trying to do?

You can leave now.

Mrs. Dallman, I know this is difficult.

I know it's a hard situation.

This is-

Thank you very much, Ms.
Horne for wasting my time.

I will have a talk with Hettie,

and I guarantee she won't
be poking nobody else.

Mrs. Dallman, this is serious.

Hettie, I am so sorry.

I didn't mean to upset you last time.

I just thought that if I-

Why are you here?

What?

Hettie, we're family.

I care about you.

Really?

Don't be like that, Hettie.

Eva started basketball.

She's pretty good too.

You're just like all of them.

You act like everything is
everything all the time.

Do not say that.

I'm nothing like them, and you know it.

What is wrong with you?

If you run these stockings girl.

I'm gonna be late, woman.

You already are, ain't you?

It started at 5:30, right?

Don't y'all forget to be back here

before I have to go to work.

What are you worried about it for?

Your part-time job ain't going nowhere.

I gotta go to work tonight too.

What's wrong with you little girl?

Me and your mom will be back.

I'm going to warm up the car.

Look, it's not like me and your father

go out all the time.

Now, you listen to your aunt Janine,

and you do what she tell you to do,

and don't be acting up.

Now, go on over there and
watch TV or something.

I look okay?

Fine.

Hey, why don't you go play
in your room or something?

My show getting ready to come on.

arrived in
Beverly Hills safe and sound.

No.

Hey, what happened?

Hey, hey, it's me, it's me.

Breathe, breathe,

hey, relax.

Just breathe, hold that.

It was just a dream.

It's just a bad dream, all right.

You act like you trying to help me,

but you just doing your job.

Part of my job is to help you, Hettie.

Now, tell me about your mother.

You intimated that she
never listened to you.

No.

Why?

She was just always too
busy with work or whatever.

Your mother worked then.

Yes.

Your father, did he work as well?

Nights?

It was just you and your parents.

And aunt Janine.

You said your aunt lived with you?

Anyone else?

Felicia would stay sometimes.

Why we gotta do this?

Why don't they just kill me already?

Why are they dragging it out?

Okay, let's stay focused, Hettie.

I don't wanna talk about this no more.

I know. I know it's hard,
but this is the beginning.

It's always hard in the beginning, Hettie.

Now, tell me about Felicia.

We were like sisters.

You were close.

It sounds to me like your
mother had her hands full.

Do you think she was just overwhelmed

with all she had to do?

She was always busy.

Well, you could imagine
taking care of you

and your family is a big responsibility.

She didn't take care of anything.

She took care of you and your
father, clothed and fed you.

Clothing and feeding ain't
taking care of your child.

This is all her fault.

What can't you say, Hettie?

Can I get some water, please?

Okay, calm down.

Take a deep breath.

Slowly.

Take a sip.

Better?

What happened, Hettie?

Look how high I'm going.

Me too, watch Felicia.

Now, I'm gonna jump over the moon.

That's not funny.

Yeah, it is.

You okay, I'll go get aunt Ellie.

I'm okay.

That's cause you got a hard head.

Stop it.

Okay, let's play a game.

I don't wanna play with
you, you make fun of me.

I'm sorry, okay, your
head is not that hard.

Let's play doll though.

Okay, I don't wanna
be the baldheaded one.

They're both baldheaded.

Hettie, your momma calling you.

Come Felicia.

No, she just wants you.

Felicia can stay here.

Look at this ugly ass doll.

Did you do this to this doll?

I heard y'all up here
jumping on that bed again,

weren't you?

We was just playing.

Y'all gonna break
them springs on that bed

and cut your feet.

Then you won't be jumping
no more, will you?

What time your mama and
them coming to pick you up?

I know I said I'd have
it to you last Wednesday,

but I'm really close.

I'm on my last case,

and then I should have the
final manuscript ready for you.

You won't be disappointed.

Just bear with me a little longer.

Hey, are you okay?

Where's your mom?

What did he do to you?

No.

Hey, good morning.

I got you something to eat.

You haven't been eating enough.

You didn't have to do this, really.

I know, but I want to.

I really have to get back to work.

I was thinking maybe
we could get out today

watch a ball game,

have a couple of hotdogs,
maybe some beers.

Abby, you need to take care of yourself.

It's just this case.

This case.

Abby, let it go.

Just for today.

Come on.

Okay.

No joke, it seriously took
John an hour to find his pants.

What?

I'm not kidding.

Oh my gosh.

I told you that you'd feel better.

Have a good day.

Yeah.

I told you, I told you.

I'm right sometimes.

You always know, don't you?

I mean, when you let me.

â™ª It feels like I can't
break the surface â™ª

â™ª I feel so confused
but you're worthless â™ª

â™ª I'm fighting for the
love that is â™ª

â™ª But is seems like you're
closing the curtains â™ª

â™ª I'm not being silent I'm perfect â™ª

â™ª The past made me think
it's not worth it â™ª

â™ª I swear it's not you I'm just broken â™ª

â™ª To be honest I'm scared to go all in â™ª

â™ª Fall â™ª

â™ª Are we ready to fall â™ª

â™ª Afraid of the fall â™ª

â™ª Is this where we fall â™ª

â™ª Fall â™ª

â™ª Are we ready to fall â™ª

â™ª Afraid of a fall â™ª

â™ª Tell me where we fall â™ª

â™ª I know we didn't want to rush but â™ª

â™ª I didn't expect to love you so much â™ª

â™ª And my love â™ª

â™ª So many memories between us â™ª

â™ª It would be stupid to give this all up â™ª

â™ª Still this is tough â™ª

â™ª Tell â™ª

â™ª my head is spinning â™ª

You're looking well.

Thanks, I've been working out a bit.

You're a big ham, you know that?

How are you really doing, Abby?

I'm fine, I'm fine.

I'm pulling you off this case.

Why? Brad, I'm making progress.

Counter transference anyone?

I am not emotionally
connected to my client.

What was that little
episode the other day?

Not getting enough rest.

Working too hard.

Look, me and Martin are doing better.

I got some rest.

Brad, I am really close.

Okay, fine.

We need to get the initial
competency hearing scheduled.

Are you close to a report?

Yes, she's unlike any
client I've ever met,

and still demonstrates classic
traits of familial abuse.

Was she competent enough
for the initial hearing?

I need another meeting with her.

I don't think that's
such a good idea, Abby.

Are you gonna be okay?

Mm-hmm..

Abby, this is me right now.

Not defense attorney
Steiner, your friend, Brad.

Seriously Abby.

Yes, plus there's no time

to get another psychologist on the case.

I'm fine.

Yeah Rich, what do you want?

You need to get together?
I'm on my way.

So the initial hearing is not a trial.

It is to determine whether
or not you're competent

and able to stand trial.

Do you understand?

Do you understand that the actual trial

could result in a capital
punishment sentence?

You could be sentenced to death.

Why is it taking so long?

Well, first is the report,

and then the initial hearing
where the judge will-

No, the sentence.

They already got their minds made up.

Why don't they just finish it already?

Hettie, this isn't something
you should take lightly.

Is that what you think?

I would love to know what you think.

No, you don't.

I mean, that all sounds
good for your J-O-B,

but don't nobody really wanna know.

Hettie, I do wanna know.

You know why?

Because death doesn't
offer second chances.

Well done.

You get the nuthouse
doctor of the year award.

That life is worth it
and everything speech?

You get the award for best avoidance.

What do you want me to say?

What does it matter?

Justice.

It ain't no such thing.

So that's it.

You die.
End of story.

My story's already over.

Then tell me the final chapter.

You believe you killed your parents.

I did kill them.

That's what you want me to say, right?

I killed them.

I killed them.

I killed them.

Fine, why?

There you go again.

Running away.

You believe you're gonna die,

so you might as well have your final say.

Why?

Why are they dead?

Perfect.

Excuse me.

Sunday dinners, maybe a cute
little puppy to play with,

all while daddy is bringing
his little princess presents,

and your only worry is what dress to wear

to some fancy rich girl party.

Why are your parents dead, Hettie?

What did they do?

Did they drink too much?

Did they ignore on you?

What did they do to make you suffer?

You can't begin to know my suffering.

So much suffering that they
paid for with their lives.

Don't-

Tell me what happened
in that house, Hettie.

This wasn't recent, was it?

How old were you, Hettie?

You were young, weren't you?

You were young and you weren't
able to protect yourself,

and it was...

All you could do to get through a day.

You've seen the devil too?

You've seen the devil too.

You've seen the devil too.

Guard, hello.

I know I'm not a gourmet chef,

but I don't think it's that bad.

Sorry.

What's going on with you today?

Nothing just I'm trying to-

It's that case.

It's nothing.

You've seen the devil too.

You've seen the devil too.

You've seen the devil too.

You've seen the devil too.

You've seen the devil too.

It's that case.

A baby is not gonna fix this

It's that case.

It's that case.

A baby is not gonna fix this.

It's that case.

You've seen the devil too.

We don't talk about
those things in my family.

â™ª You know I hate to
see your river run dry â™ª

â™ª And I'm not looking for a reason â™ª

â™ª To keep my heart uptight â™ª

â™ª You've got a way about you â™ª

â™ª I don't wanna live without your love â™ª

â™ª Your love â™ª

â™ª Go on and pick an apple off my tree â™ª

â™ª You know I love to watch you leave â™ª

â™ª With just a little piece of me â™ª

â™ª It's just something about you â™ª

â™ª I won't walk away without your love â™ª

Hi, mom.

Hi.

I do believe it's getting colder.

Have you done your sweaters out yet?

No.

The weather said it would
be warm for a while.

What do they know?

Let me have this.

Look, BB.

Look at the colors in this.

You could redo your
kitchen in these colors.

Look, you could place these
around near the windowsill.

I don't know ma'.

I wasn't planning on redoing my kitchen.

Well, it could use some color,

you know, a woman's touch.

What am I?

Yeah. Well, you were
always such a tomboy,

roughhousing with those boys all the time.

Look at this BB.

You could make these curtains

and bring the color straight
out to the living room.

I hate that color, ma'.

Well you have to
actually see it hanging up.

You'll love it.

Ma', do you remember Allan?

I wouldn't forget my own nephew.

I could get some yarn and
make some matching potholders.

I think that they have a sale
going on right now at Katie's.

Do you remember how he used
to come over all the time

and then just, and stopped?

Yes, he did.

BB look here.

Why are you here again?

I'm gonna keep coming
here to see you, Hettie.

Why?

I had them put some money
on your spending account

so you can get some snacks
and buy some magazines.

I ain't ask you for no money.

The vending machine
snacks are probably better

than the food that's in here.

Look, you ain't gotta do nothing for me.

I'll get you one of
those wraparound blankets

that you can put your arms through.

None of that is gonna matter, soon-

I'll get you some slippers too.

Stop. Just stop.

Hettie.

Ain't none of that gonna matter soon.

You are scaring me.

You matter to me.

You're the only one who
can possibly understand

what we've been-

What?

What?

Never mind.

They said I can bring
the blanket next time.

I don't want it.

I'm bringing it anyway.

Julie, your mom was here again.

How could you guess?

Well, she is always trying
to redecorate our house.

She hates my style or lack thereof.

Well that's because sexy is your style.

I'm gonna take a shower.

Do you wanna join me?

No, you stink.

What, what?

You stink.

No, I don't.
Seriously, you go take a-

What?

You stink.

I do stink, okay.

You wanna order takeout tonight?

555-41-22.

All of these messages are from 555-41-22.

What are you doing with my phone?

Picture?

Picture.

And your replies.

That's hot.

Damn, you're sexy.

How about I show you a
little something, something.

Abby, wait.

Calm down.

That's back when we were having issues.

These messages came through night.

Why are you going through my phone?

I wasn't.

It's not what it looked like.

It looked like you were
going through my phone.

Is that where your ring is?

What.

At your girlfriends house.

I lost it at the gym.

I told you that.

I'm not stupid, Martin.

I'm not doing this, Abby.

I'm not playing this game.

I can't.

I'm done.

Just when we were doing so well,

you just can't allow yourself
to be happy, can you?

Get out.

Don't-

Leave.

That was a final report
on the Dallman client.

Could you make sure Steiner gets that?

Okay, thanks.

Excuse me.

Are you Hettie's lawyer?

I'm her doctor.

I'm sorry, you are?
I'm her cousin, Felicia.

I overheard you saying
something about Hettie.

Could I please speak with you a moment?

I can't tell you what your
cousin and I speak about.

That would be a HIPAA violation and-

You don't have to tell me anything.

Just listen, please.

They're gonna kill her, aren't they?

I can't say what the courts
will or will not decide.

I'm sorry, I have another meeting.

Please, I'm not asking you.

I'm stating a fact.

They're gonna kill her.

It's not her fault.

All of this.

She can't help what happened to her.

You and Hettie were close?

Like sisters.

She tell you that?

I can't say.

You tell me.

Doctor-

Williams.

Dr. Williams, there are
things we just don't talk about

in my family.

Things we look away from.

Hettie doesn't deserve this.

What happened Felicia?

You know what's funny,

if a stranger committed a
crime against your child,

you would want him locked under the jail,

but we all look the other
way when it's family.

Do you think your family
deserve what they got?

Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

Listen to your elders.

No talking back.

You really are at the mercy
of adults as children.

Adults are supposed to be
the protectors of children.

Maybe, but we grew up, we survived it.

Did you really?

Maybe they're right.

Nothing we can do can change anything now.

Hettie made her choices.

She did this.

She chose this.

I'm sorry I wasted your time.

No more running.

Isn't that the problem though?

You're always running, but
you have nowhere to run to.

What do you want me to say?

You came to me.

Why?

To save Hettie.

You wanna save Hettie?

Then you need to talk to me.

What happened in that house?

You are stepping way over the line.

What happened in that house?

What do you think happened?

It happened to you too, didn't it?

We don't talk about
those things in my family.

Hettie is not the only
one guilty here, is she?

Please just save Hettie.

You understand now, right?

You're a doctor.

Please, can't you just help her?

Please.

You're stating that in
your professional opinion,

Dr. Williams, that Hettie
Dallman is a disturbed woman

who needs psychiatric care.

Yes.

Thank you.

That is exactly what Ms. Dallman

would like you to believe.

When's the next Academy
Awards Dr. Williams?

I mean, she does deserve the Oscar

for best actress in the
portrayal of a psycho.

Objection.

We have the doctor to
testify against malingering.

Ms Barnes.

Dr. Williams, you requested
to examine Ms. Dallman

after she brutally murdered
both of her parents.

Can you tell us of her demeanor.

She was unresponsive and distant.

Unresponsive?

Did she appear to be in shock?

No, but patients like
Ms. Dallman tends to-

Did she seem to understand
what had happened?

What was your conversation with her?

She didn't say a word.

Nothing.

Well, did she at least seem upset?

I mean, an ounce of remorse

over blowing her parents to kingdom come?

Judge, your honor, sir.

Ms. Barnes, I'm not amused.

Ask the question.

Did Ms. Dallman show any signs

that she understood what she had done?

I cannot ascertain that
on our first meeting,

but Ms. Dallman was not
in a stable, mental state.

She suffers from depression, PTSD.

Yet Dr. Williams,

you stated the defendant to be competent

at the time of the murders.

What does this mean?

It means that she
was in her full faculty

when she committed the act, but-

You said she knew.

She knew what she was doing
when she took the gun,

pointed it at her mother
as she shot her first,

and then blew her father's
brains out moments after.

Am I to understand Dr. Williams

that even with PTSD and depression,

your report stated the defendant

was competent to stand trial.

On further review on
my report findings, I-

I am asking you again, Dr. Williams,

is that the defendant Ms.
Dallman competent to stand trial

for the murders of Samuel
and Eleanor Dallman?

Yes or no?

No.

I'm sorry, can you repeat that please?

No.

Am I to understand
that you are now changing
your diagnosis doctor?

On further examination of the patient,

I believe Ms. Dallman was
neither competent then or now.

Your honor, in lieu
of this new information,

I recommend my client be remanded

at the facility for mental health.

Your honor, this is ridiculous.

It is clear my client
may not be in a state

to continue to trial.

and needs to be examined to determine

if she can be restored to competency.

I don't believe this.

Where'd you find this quack?

That's not necessary Ms. Barnes.

Escort, Ms. Dallman out and
both of you in my chambers now.

You look tired.

So they're keeping you here longer, right?

That's better.

It's still on locked four walls.

I guess you gonna keep coming to see me.

Do you really want me to stop coming?

I understand why you did it.

I think just why didn't you talk to me?

It didn't have to be this.

You were like my sister.

I still am.

Out of all of them, you was the one.

Hettie.

You was the one I was supposed to-

Hettie. What could I have done?

I couldn't save me.

How could I save you?

Why you leave?

It was too much.

My sister.

I couldn't stay.

You know I couldn't stay.

Out of all of the, you
was my family you knew.

I didn't know how to face it.

Every day, every day,

I had to pretend like it didn't happen.

Heavy on my back like a ton of weights.

I just had to pretend, and
it's right there in my face.

It chocked my soul, and
every everybody know,

but don't nobody care.

What was I supposed to do?

You weren't supposed
to leave me, Felicia.

I'm sorry, Hettie.

I'm sorry.

You're not the only one it happened to.

I'm gonna tell.

I mean it.

I'm gonna tell.

What that gonna do?

You think they don't know?

Why you think they let
me watch you the time?

All I do for you and you ain't nothing

but an ungrateful spoiled little brat.

You best not say nothing.

No guard, I don't wanna see her.

Hettie, please give me-
You think I'm crazy.

I wanna help you.

I didn't ask for your help.

Hettie, there is a way through this.

Please, sit.

Why are you doing this?

Why do you even care?

Tell me more about Felicia.

Why?

Because I think the same
thing that happened to her

happened to you.

You leave her out of it.

Fine.

This is about you.

You have to fight this.

Look, I handled what I needed to.

Why can't you just let this end.

Hettie, it is not your fault
that this happened to you.

You deserve better.

Maybe I don't.

Hettie, it doesn't have to end this way.

We can work through this.

Please, let me help you.

Stop touching me.

I don't want your help.

Why can't you just leave me alone?

No more running.

Tell me something, Hettie,

when are you gonna take
control of your own life?

Stupid bitch.

You think you got all of my answers.

Did you think the devil too?

I should fucking kill you.

You damn, ass stupid ass
arrogant bitch.

Get your hands off of me.

If I catch you in this,
I'm gonna kill you.

You okay?

What the hell are you doing here?

Have you completely lost your mind?

I lost control.

Loss control is an understatement.

You're just as crazy as she is.

Come on, let's go.

Wait. I wanna try again
when she calms down.

You're kidding me.

What is it with you in this case?

Why are you doing this?

Because I am her.

I am her.

It's coming back in bits and
pieces, but I don't know.

I think I blocked it.

We were just sitting there and watching TV

and then I don't know what happened.

We should go, Abby.

You should see someone.

I was 15 years old, and I was held down.

I couldn't move.

I couldn't breathe.

time stopped, I couldn't move.

Come on.

But I see it now, the
part where I told my mother.

I see the pain that was in her eyes,

and you know what she did, nothing.

Absolutely nothing.

She was my mother Steiner,
she was supposed to help me,

but absolutely nothing.

I'm sorry, Abby.

Why don't you go.

You son of a bitch.

Dear. God,

Mom, what are you doing here?

Almost having a heart attack.

I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

I was coming to bring you
clay cats for the windowsill.

Ma', the clay cats look like
a five-year-old made them.

Don't put them on the window.

You've been drinking too much.

No, ma', I'm still conscious.

Where's Martin?

Gone.

Gone, gone where?

He's a cheating asshole, so he's gone.

Abigail, now you
watch your tone with me.

Well, you're not getting a divorce.

You two will work this out.

He may wander a bit, but
he'll come back home.

I'm gonna make you some coffee.

You need to straighten up.

You said he'll come back.

Well, what if I don't want him back?

That's the bottle talking.

The two of you will work this out.

I just wanted to help her.

I couldn't even do that.

Who?

Hettie, that's who.

Well, who's Hettie?

The one like me, like me.

Calm down.

And I couldn't even help her.

I can't even help me.

You can't help someone that
doesn't wanna be helped, BB.

Do you remember when
I told you about, Allan?

Why are you bringing that up?

You remember when I
told you he did to me?

Do you remember that?

I don't wanna talk about it.

I just assumed you forget that name.

Forget.

I forgot, and I buried it deep, deep.

BB, leave the past in the past.

But I can't ma'.

Don't you see the past is the present?

Those statues would have looked so nice

on this windowsill.

Stop it.

You don't get to pretend anymore.

I'm not pretending.

There's no use going on about things

that happened over 15 years ago.

Get over it.

Let it go.

It's in the past.

Here, you need to drink this.

Tell me how you did it ma'.

Tell me how you lived with
yourself all these years

and knew that your 15-year-old daughter

was raped by your nephew.

Stop it.

That he held her down
and took her innocence.

Stop it.

Stop talking.

That you didn't do
a damn thing about it.

I couldn't.

What?

I didn't wanna believe
he was my sister's child.

I couldn't change what happened.

I thought it's best that
you forget and move on.

What did you want me to do?

What was I supposed to do?

You were supposed to admit it.

Admit that it happened.

, and turn in my own nephew?

Send our family to jail?

I was your family too.

Don't you think that it broke my heart

knowing what he did to you?

I couldn't admit it.

I won't.

My little girl.

My baby girl.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

All rise.

You can be seated.

Good afternoon.

We are reconvening to determine
the defendant's competency

for trial after the
specified period of time

in the mental health facility.

Yes, your honor.

I have reviewed several reports
from the facility doctors,

and they believe Ms. Dallman
is restored to competency

for this trial.

Your honor, the defense believes

that Ms. Dallman may still
be a danger to herself,

and to others.

This trial may heighten that state.

The hospital staff psychiatrist

has declared her able
to continue to trial.

Are we now refuting?

This is still the case your honor.

Unless you have evidence,

to the contrary, Mr. Steiner,

the hospital findings will stay.

Your honor.

If I may, my client would
like to address the court

on her behalf.

You do understand Ms. Dallman

this is not an official testimony,
and we are not in trial.

I see you, Ms. Prosecutor.

You think I'm a monster?

You're a grown woman, Hettie.

You made your choices.

You don't know nothing about my choices.

I know everything
about you, Ms. Dallman.

Moving from job to job and from man to...

I'm sorry, woman to woman as well.

Your honor, I think we can end this now

and let the trial court take it from here.

Ms. Barnes.
You dropped out of high
school, continued to leech...

I'm sorry, live off of your parents,

and the only way that you
could see to thank them

was to blow their brains out.

Charlene, that's enough.

Wait, you get everything.

Don't you, Hettie?

You get the money, you get the house,

and you get the little dog too, right?

You don't know shit.

Order.

Order.

Adjourn.

Brad, I'm sorry.

You really don't have
to apologize, Abby.

I put you in an awkward situation,

and my credibility is all but shot.

You'll come back from this.

I wonder.

What of Hettie?

It's up to the jury now.

Do you think any justice
will come out of it?

I don't know, Abby.

All I can do is present what I can prove

and leave the rest up to the system.

It still doesn't change anything.

Tell me, do you think a family
that looks the other way

when a child is abused is just as guilty

as the perpetrator of the crime?

How many lives are ruined and for what?

Family honor?

It's family shame.

I don't know.
Maybe people really do
need to let go of stuff

that happened over 20 years ago.

Just get on with their lives.

What does it matter now anyway?

Ask Hettie.

Beauty is spelled A-B-B-Y.

I don't think that line will
work on me anymore, Martin.

I've been looking all over for you.

Well, you found me.

Now what?

Abby, I never cheated on you.

It all started with a flirtation

and then she started
sending these pictures

and things got out of hand.

I am so sorry.

I can't deal with this right now.

I've been going through a lot,

and I just don't think
I have the strength.

Hey, let me be here for you.

Let me be your strength.

Let me be your rock.

You can't fix this with a joke Martin.

You have no idea what I've been through.

Well, tell me, clue me in.

There are things in my past.

I've just had a lot of
things come to the surface,

and my emotions are all over the place.

I just can't deal with this.

I can't deal with us in
the midst of all this.

Hey, you don't get to walk away.

You don't get to throw us away.

Now, I know I may not exactly understand

what you're going through,

but that doesn't mean
I wanna throw us away

in the midst of this.

I don't think I can-

Okay. I get it.

The husband and wife thing

isn't really working out right now.

You don't have to focus on that.

Here, just...

How about we try the best friends thing.

You always were my best friend.

Just let me be your friend through this.

Try and love me as that for now.

Let's go home.

Yes, fine. Thanks.

Yes, the manuscript is ready for you.

You should have it by Monday morning.

No, I'm gonna be taking some time off.

Well, thank you.

Okay, bye.

This case has been a unique one.

In fact, our client is clearly
showing signs of aggression

and possible PTSD.

However, the defendant's
mental state of mind

at the time of the alleged
murder is currently the question.

The prosecution has presented
evidence that may suggest

the client is malingering
to escape the problem.

I do not believe that to be the case.

However, I do think the
defendant was well aware

of her actions at the time of the murders.

No.

I find the defendant
competent to stand trial.

Hettie.

Wait, wait.

Did you ever tell your parents?

Did anyone ever know, Hettie?

We don't talk about things
like that in my family.
