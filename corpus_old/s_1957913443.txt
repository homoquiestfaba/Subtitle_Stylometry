I
had a dream about you.

Melanie, my babysitter
and my best friend.

In the dream I was your baby.

And it was just you and me.

Together forever.

Johnny?

Come in!

Honey, I just
talked to Melanie.

Is she here?

Not yet, she just called
to say she has to leave early

today.
Why?

Well one of her
clients is having a baby

so she needs to go help them.

But I can come home from
work and then you and me

can have a day together, okay?

Okay.

Listen, you're gonna
come outta this thing

a whole new person.

Yes, rebirth!

Yes.

Yeah, I know it's
loud, his mom wanted me

to take him to the park.

Hold on, you're not
filming me again, are you?

No.

Yeah, we've been
doing this whole thing

where we record a
video and then like

mouth along to the words.

Yeah, yeah, like a lip sync.

Anyway, um, cool.

Well, um, I'm gonna
be with him until six.

That's usually when
his mom comes home.

So, uh, I can be in
the city around eight

and we can get some dinner
and then get trashed.

Hi, Melanie.
Hi.

Um, so-
It's just hard to say

how long it will be before
they need me, I'm sorry.

No, no, no.

It's the first
time it's happened.

They just keep texting you?

Yeah,
every half hour.

It's her first baby, so-
Right.

She's nervous.

Oh, um, hold on,
I just need to get this.

Sure.

Hi, this is Claire.

Melanie, I feel
good when I'm with you.

Outside there are
things that feel bad.

Like kids who laugh at you

or say you look like a girl.

Like that's a bad thing.

But when we're home
it's just me and you.

He's
really gonna miss you.

I know,
it's a bummer.

I mean, I'm
gonna miss you too,

but this is a big
moment for you.

Yeah, totally.

So, uh, will
you just be working

with the same midwife now or...?

Well, I
actually just joined

this natural birth collective.

Oh, cool.
So I'll give you a call

if they need me, but...

All right.
I mean, who knows.

Bye, Johnny.
Bye, Mom!

And remember our
deal, some time outside today.

I know!

Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye.

And...smile.

Okay, you ready?

Pump it up.

What is it?

It's a video.
Let me see.

Uh, looks freaky.

I'm freaky.

Free-spirit
meditation, an introduction.

Part one, what is free
spirit meditation?

We are not individuals because
we are each of us, divisible.

We are body and spirit.

Free-spirit meditation
allows the spirit

to break free from the
limitations of physical form

and to seek experiences that
the body cannot provide.

Freedom, adventure, escape.

Part two, how can I do
free-spirit meditation?

Find a comfortable
position, close your eyes,

slow your breath.

Visualize a light
and simply let go.

Let your spirit leave your
body and go to the light.

Hi, Sharon.

Hey, Melanie.
Hi.

Hi, Priya,
how are you feeling?

I'm okay, I'm okay.

I really didn't sleep
at all last night.

Yeah?

How far apart are
the contractions?

Maybe um-
15, 16 minutes.

Okay, good.

All right, I'm gonna
call Johnny's mom,

and when she gets
home I can leave

and I'll go home and shower and

then I'll come over-
Can I come?

In a little while.
Yeah, that sounds good.

Can I come too?
Johnny, we're talking, okay?

But I can help.

Oh, and my legs
have been cramping up.

Um, yeah.
It kinda hurts.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just saying

to Priya I wish I
could go into her body

and do the hard part for her.

Uh, yeah.
Right?

Well, until I get there,
lie down and rest,

maybe go outside for
a walk if you can.

Maybe, uh...

Sorry this
is such bad timing,

I know you probably
just got to work.

All right, I'm just
looking at one thing here.

You know what, I actually think
I can get back to the house

in an hour and a half.

Is that gonna work?

Yeah,
that should be fine.

Oh, have you
guys gone outside at all?

He promised me
that he would spend

just a little time in the park.

I know.
Good boy.

Close your eyes.

Slow your breath.

Visualize a light.

Let go.

Whoa.

This is so weird.

Wait.

Whoa.

Johnny?

Hello?

Are you up there?

Oh, hey, there you are.

Want a smoothie?

Mm-hm.

Free-spirit
meditation allows you to send

your spirit into other beings.

Animals, plants,
inanimate objects.

You can even send your
spirit into another person,

leaving your body
alive but catatonic.

When you enter another
human, your spirit takes over

their conscious mind
and the host's spirit

sinks down into
the subconscious.

Now you can see through
someone else's eyes,

speak with their voice.

You can make a
home of a new body.

It's an experience
unlike any other.

Are you ready?

Melanie?

Yeah?

Why do you like being a doula?

Um, why do you ask?

I don't know.

Well, I like being
so close to birth

and I like-
Well maybe you could

be my babysitter and be a doula.

Like do both.

I wish I could.

But, you know, sometimes
you gotta let go

of who you were to
become who you wanna be.

Does that make sense?

I wish
I could be your smoothie,

because then you'd
digest me and I'd become

a part of your body.

And we'd always be together.

Johnny?

Hello?

Is this hide and seek?

Melanie,
I'm right behind you.

Johnny?

Let's go!

Okay.

Oh.

I wonder where Johnny could be.

Oh wow.

I'm Melanie.

That's my voice.

Let go.

Hello?

Anybody home?

Hey.

Hi.

Where's Johnny?

Johnny, he's sleeping.

Oh, really?

He never takes a nap.

Um, uh huh.

Are you okay?

Yes.

All right, I'm gonna
go check on him upstairs.

No!

I have to show you something.

What?

It's a surprise.

Oh, okay.

Uh, I'm gonna go to
the bathroom first.

He has a little crush on
you, did you know that?

I actually found a letter.

I found it hidden in his drawer.

Did he ever give it to you?

Oh, I wish I could
remember what it said.

Oh, it was so cute.

Um-
That was his private letter.

I guess it was.

He never used to hide
anything from me.

It's silly, but I worry
that he feels closer

to you than he does to me.

Anyway, uh, you had something
that you wanted to show me?

Yes.

Here, Johnny drew this.

Oh!

Yeah.
That's nice.

Yeah, it's nice.

Yeah, he did the, he did
the house, that's the head.

And the house is the head
and the windows are the eyes.

Oh, there's a
little boy inside.

Yeah.

Well, you probably
have to run.

Huh?

Your client.

Oh.
Oh, no, no, no.

It's all good.

I took the afternoon
off, you go ahead.

Johnny and I will
spend the day together.

No, I don't have to go.

Oh, I thought you
said she was already in labor.

Not anymore.

Huh.
Yeah.

So, um, you can, you can leave.

Oh.

Well, uh...

Yeah, I do have some
errands that I can run.

Oh, I would really
love to go to the gym.

Uh huh.

Um, yeah, all right, great.

Great.
Yeah, thank you.

You're welcome.

Hey, so you're
sure it's all right

for me to head out?

Yeah, I don't mind.

All right.

Well, I really appreciate it.

Oh, so uh, did Johnny
get any park time today?

Uh, no.
Okay, because he and I

made a deal just a
little time outside.

He really has to-
I know!

Um, he told me.

Oh, he did?

Good, okay.

OK, here's my...

Well I will see
you later tonight.

Yeah, okay, bye.

Love y...

I love you too, Melanie.

Bye.

Hi, um,
why is there a piece

of white cloth in my vagina?

Okay,
here's what I found.

Tampon, noun, a plug
of absorbent material

used to soak up menstrual
blood during a woman's period.

What
is woman's period?

The
problem with me being in you

is that we can't talk.

But I can pretend.

Hi, Johnny.

Melanie, wow.

You just look so amazing.

I know.

Maybe
you should go outside.

I just wanna
stay home with you.

Come
on, go show everybody

how beautiful you are.

What are you afraid of?

Nobody's gonna laugh
at you, I promise.

Come on, you're Melanie.

You're the smartest and coolest

and the prettiest
girl in the world.

Melanie.

Where are you?

Somewhere far away?

I wish we were
together right now.

Um, hello?
Yeah, okay, good, good.

Hey, Melanie.
Yes, this is me, Melanie.

Who is this?
It's Sharon.

So, Priya's water broke.
Let me talk to her.

What?
Let me talk to her.

Here, I'm
gonna pass her the phone.

Melanie, are
you still babysitting?

Um, no, I left from there.

Great, so you're on
your way over here now, right?

Sharon just finished
filling the birth pool,

but I don't know if I
should get in now or...

What do you think?

What do I think?

Hey, it's me again.

Priya's having a contraction.

We'll see you soon, yeah?

Yeah, uh...

You're
the best, Melanie.

Thanks, bye.

Bye.

Come on!

Were they...?

Were they laughing at me?

Melanie?

It's Sunita.

From high school.

Oh my god, come here.

What's going on?

What do you mean?

Like, what
are you up to these days?

Oh.

I'm a babysitter.
Yeah?

For Johnny.

He's probably my best friend.

That's cool.

Uh huh, it's cool.

I've been really busy with-
I got woman's period today.

But it's okay because
I had a period tampon.

Do you have period today?

No.

Wow, well, you
look really great.

No, I don't.

I have to go home and
clean my face and stuff.

Oh, uh,
where do you live?

Where do I live?

Like, your apartment?

My apartment?

Melanie?

I have to go now, goodbye.

Melanie?

Hello?

You can make
a home of a new body.

...takes over and
the host sinks down

into the subconscious.

Part four, exiting a host body.

Once your spirit is in another
body, exiting is simple.

All you have to do is let go.

Imagine your spirit
is holding a mirror.

In the reflection you
see someone else's face.

Let them go.

Let the mirror f...

Part five, what do I do if I'm
stuck in an inanimate object?

Part six, where
should I keep my body

while my spirit is...

Part seven, how can
I communicate with
a human host spirit?

While your spirit
is in a host body,

you can make contact
with the host spirit

by opening the subconscious.

Take a deep breath,
clear your mind.

Think 'open subconscious'
or 'close subconscious'.

However, once you
begin letting go,

the ability to
communicate shuts down

as the free spirit detaches-
Open subconscious.

Can anyone hear me?
Open subconscious.

Hello?
Melanie?

Oh, Johnny.

What is going on?

I can hear your voice but I
can't really see anything.

Oh,
I think the video said

you're in the subconscious.
Wait, wait, what video?

The free-spirit one.

I did what it said and my
spirit floated into your body.

What?

I know, right?

It's crazy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I can hear my voice.

Are you speaking in my voice?

Oh, sorry.

Oh, no, no, that's okay.

So you meditated into...

That's, wow.

Are you some kind of...

Wait, is that my phone?

It says Sharon.
Oh my god.

Um, yeah, answer it I guess.

Hi.
Hey.

Priya keeps asking when
you're getting here.

I thought you were on your way?

Oh, my God.
Um.

Uh, just
say you'll come right over.

You'll come right over.
What?

I'll come right over.
I'll come right over.

Okay,
hurry if you can.

Oh my god, whoa.

Um.

Is someone knocking on the door?

Oh, I can go look.

Hey, cutie pie, you home?

I hear Tom's voice.

Wait, why is he at your house?

I'm not at my house.

Um, I'm at your apartment.

How did y...

Why are you at my apartment?

Well,
it's kind of like that

you're at your apartment
'cause I'm you, remember?

No, no, no.

You're not me

you're just-

Bless you.
Okay, you know what?

Just tell him to leave.

But I
thought he was your boyfriend.

Shugs, you gonna let me it?
No, he's not my boyfriend.

We just, um, sometimes-
Melanie.

Yeah, I'm not gonna

explain this to you.

Wait, are you opening the door?

Don't open the door.

Hi.

Hello.

I like that dress.

Johnny,
tell him to go away right now.

Go away.

You want me to go?

Okay.

Is he gone?

Not yet.

Not yet.
You know what?

Try not to answer me out loud.

Right, sorry.

No.

You have to go away.

Okay, I will.

I just gotta go to the
bathroom first if that's okay.

Um.
Wait, what's going on?

I gotta go bad.

Whoa.

Whoa, did you let him in?

He's
just going to the bathroom.

Oh, this is not good.

How did this even...?

Okay, I gotta figure out how...

What, are you
listening to him pee?

What? No.

Okay, okay.

When he comes out of
there, do not engage.

Just get him to leave.

Fine by me.

Don't
even look at him, okay?

Sure, easy.

There's no music on.

That's really unlike you.

What is he doing?

I think he's dancing?

You like the way
I move my body?

Oh no.

Okay, yeah, this has to stop.

Dance with me.

No.

No you will not.

Go turn off the music.

Come on!

There you go.

There you go.

Hey,
turn off the music right now.

I
was just walking over

there to do that.

Aren't you supposed to be
looking after little Jimmy?

Johnny.

Johnny, right.
Don't talk to him!

He called me Jimmy.

What was that?

I
didn't say anything.

Okay, I
need you to stay in your head.

Okay.

I'm gonna go get some water now.

What? Wait.

Why is he even here?

Like how did that happen?

Why don't you like him?

Johnny.
I think he's nice.

Okay, listen to me.

I need you to trust me
that this can go very badly

very quickly, so I need you to
get him out of my apartment.

Okay, fine.
Um, Tom?

I'm in here!

In the bedroom.

Oh. What?

Um, Melanie?

What is happening?

He's on
the bed and his pants are off.

Oh no.

Can we cuddle
just for a minute?

Oh, my god!
Um, no because

you have to go now.

What's
going on with you?

You're not acting like yourself.

Okay, well, I am myself.

Are you breaking up with me?

Breaking up with you?

Were we even dating?

You don't gotta say anything.

I
think I hurt his feelings.

Just let him go.

Johnny?

What was that?

Oh no.

Wanna
tell me what's going on?

He's, uh...

He's hurt.

What do you mean hurt?

I think I killed him.

What?

I am so sorry.

Call 911.

Johnny? Go, go, go.

I am!

Oh, Tom.

911,
what's your emergency?

I killed somebody.
Alright.

Don't say that!
I mean-

Just say someone is hurt

and needs medical attention.

Someone...medical tension.

Okay.
Did you check to see

if he's breathing?
What's your location, ma'am?

165 Wisteria 4G.

4D.
Okay, stay on the

phone with me.
Did you check to see

if he's breathing?
Um, no.

Yes, don't hang up.

I won't, I won't.
You have to.

Go see if he's breathing.
Ma'am, I need you

to stay on the line.
Just go check on him.

Okay, uh...

Oh.

Hey.
Oh, thank god.

Messed up your towel.

Oh.

Is that 911?

Hi, I'm the guy
she's talking about.

No, I just, I um, I fell down-

Okay, that was really f...

Messed up, wow.

Okay, all right, I gotta focus.

You have to get out of my body.

I have to get to the birth and-

Close subconscious.

What'd you say?

Close subconscious.

Johnny...

No, no, don't send an
ambulance, I'm good, I'm good.

Okay, I will.

I'm gonna hang up now.

I should probably go.

Open subconscious.

Johnny, what just happened?

I
just thought I could-

No, you know what?

I don't have time for this.

You have to get out
of my body right now.

Well,
the video said to get out

I have to let go.

Okay, then, let go.

What does that mean?

How
am I supposed to know?

You are the one who did this.

Well,
I just, I don't know.

Okay, all right.

You get that this
is my life, right?

That this is my job?
I know.

So why did you do this?

I don't know.
No, I don't believe that.

Why did you do this?

I said I don't know.

Oh, okay, all right.

So you just magically floated
into my body for no reason?

Well,
yeah, well you are the one

who's leaving me just
like everybody else.

I'm not-
You're never even gonna

see me again, so
why do you care?

Okay.
I'm sorry.

It's
okay, just take a deep breath.

I
just, I just wanted to feel

what it would be like to be you.

Okay, okay.

But you can't be somebody
else, you have to be you.

What
if I don't wanna be me?

Well, you don't really know

who you are yet.

You get to choose
who you wanna be.

Oh, God.

Do you really think there
is nothing you can do

to fix this right now?

I don't...

I don't know.
Okay.

I think we have to
do this together.

You mean...

Wait, what do you mean?

Melanie?
Yeah?

I'm nervous.

It's
totally normal to be nervous,

but I'm right here.

I
don't think I can do this.

Look, you just have to do

what I tell you, okay?

Okay?
Yeah.

Was that you knocking?
Yes.

Yeah, okay,

they're not gonna hear that.

You have to knock
way louder than that.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Way too loud.

You
said I should knock louder.

Melanie, finally.

It took you forever.

She's hugging me.

Okay, well, hug her back.

Priya's upstairs.

Oh, could you close the door?

Oh.
Her contractions have

been getting really intense.

I got your voicemail the last-
Is that Melanie?

Yeah.

Okay, come on.

She's in here.

Hey.

Hey, Melanie.

Say "Hi, Priya."

Hi, Priya.

You need anything?

Mm-mm.
Are you standing

next to her?

Yes.

Say
"How are you feeling?"

How are you feeling?

We've been at
this a long time,

but she's doing so good, really.

Thanks, sweetie.

I'm happy you're finally here.

Yes, I'm here to be
your doula for you.

Nope, don't improvise.

It's really
uncomfortable around here.

I took a really long shower
and that helped but...

Oh.
Oh, breathe, baby.

Should I rub her back?

I
think we need to apologize

for being so late.

I need to move,
I need to walk.

Okay, are you sure?

Let's go.
Okay.

Say
"I'm sorry I'm so late".

I'm-
Melanie, can you see

who that is please?

Ruby?
Ruby is the midwife.

Oh, good!
So...

Yeah, answer it.

Hello?
Hi, Sharon, is that you?

Can you
get me some juice?

Yeah, no, um, this is Melanie.

Oh, hey, Melanie.
It's in the fridge!

Yes.

Listen, I planned
to be there by now.

I probably should
have left earlier.

How is everything going?

How's Priya doing?

Just
say "Everything is fine".

Everything's fine.

That's good.

Look, I'm so sorry
I'm running late.

I don't know how long it's
gonna take me to get there,

traffic is terrible.

Shit.
Shit.

I know.
No, don't repeat everything!

No, don't rep...

Oh.
What?

Nothing.
Look, call me if

you need anything.

I'll be there as
soon as I can, okay?

Okay.
Oh, and one more thing...

Look,
Johnny, this is getting

really serious now.

What was that?

Nothing.

You know what?

This is not gonna work.

You've gotta try to
figure out how to let go.

I am, I'm trying.

You good?

Your phone.
Oh.

Juice.
Thanks.

Is Ruby close?

Yes.
Yes.

When's she getting here?

She'll be here very soon.

That's not true.

Does this juice
have like a funny after taste?

She
will be here very soon,

Johnny.
No, she said she's stuck

in traffic.
Say it.

She'll be here very soon.

Okay.
No, it tastes fine.

Really?
Yes.

You've said everything
tastes weird all day.

Melanie, you try.

It tastes kinda weird, right?

Funky.

There's nothing
wrong with the juice!

Sweetie, can you
just get me my water?

Yeah, sure.

I'm gonna give
you my weight, okay?

Melanie.
Oh God.

I
can't taste the juice.

What do you mean?

I don't know.

It doesn't taste like anything.

Here,
honey. Your water.

I need to sit down.

Okay, come here.
Yeah.

Isn't that kinda weird?

Johnny-
Here we go.

Don't
worry about the juice, okay?

You have to focus.
Melanie.

Feels like he's kicking.

Tell her fetal movement

is a good thing.

It's a good thing.

It's uncomfortable.

Water?

Go rub her hips.

What are you doing?

Um-
Say what you're doing.

I'm rubbing her hips.

Your hips.
Now tell her to take

a slow breath.
What?

Tell her to...

Something
is going on with your voice.

I gotta pee again.

Okay, let's go.

It's like I need
to go but I can't.

What?

I'm
saying that.

I can't
understand what you're saying.

I can't go anymore.

I'm right here.

Could you light
some of that incense?

Yeah.

I
couldn't hear anything

you were saying back there.

Johnny, I can't really hear

you anymore...

I
can't smell this stuff.

I don't,
I don't know what's going on.

Johnny,

What?

Melanie?

Melanie, can
you come help, please?

Uh huh.

Good, okay.

Open subconscious.
Okay.

All right?
Yeah.

Melanie? Hello?

All right.
Okay, got ya.

Okay, that's good.

Come help.

Alright, okay.

You wanna just grab my leg?

Can you help?

Like this?

There you go.

Okay.

Okay.
Okay.

Uh, could you grab
one of those towels?

Melanie?

Please answer me.

Honey, can
you get me a mirror?

Yeah.

Here.
Thanks.

My arms, they keep shaking.

See?

Uh huh.

Is that...?

What do you think?

Um...

It's totally normal.

You sure?
Yes.

Oh my god, thank you.

Here you go.
Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Hey, maybe you could
put on some relaxing music?

Melanie?

Yes.

Yeah, um, music.

How about
that one playlist?

Playlist, yes.

Playlist.

How do I-
The one that you

showed us on your phone.

Phone. Oh, yeah.

Um...

Oh, sorry.

Oh, that's a podcast.

This is a good song.

You know, don't
worry about it.

Okay.

Something's wrong.
What do you mean?

The pain
is like really sharp.

Shouldn't Ruby be here?

You said she
was on her way, right?

Um-
Is that the smoke alarm?

Should I get that?
Uh-huh

Okay.

Hey, Melanie, I'm
so sorry I'm late.

Is she pushing yet?

Ruby, is that you?

I think so.
Yeah?

Hey, I'll be right there!

And how are you doing?

Good.

Good.

Hi, guys.

I'm so sorry I'm late.

How are we doing?

Hello?

Hey, Melanie.

Mom!

Hi.

How's it going?

Uh huh, good, good.

What was that?

Um, the TV.

Oh okay.

So, I'm just calling
to let you know

that I'm on my way home.

What?

Yeah, I'm
driving now so I can't talk.

But I'll see you
and Johnny soon.

Okay.

Melanie?

I'll be right there,
you're doing great.

There you go.

Hi, hi.

Do you think this is
gonna take a long time?

Why? Do you have somewhere
else you need to be?

No, no, I, I...

I just wanna know if
it's gonna take awhile.

Well, you know how this goes.

He's gonna come when he's ready.

Okay.
I'm gonna check, okay?

Okay.

Here's my touch.

There's my hand nice and slow.

You're doing great.

Melanie?

Nine and a half,

you're almost there.
Is that...

I need you.

Okay, you're getting close.

Melanie?

Can you hear me?

Johnny!
Melanie.

Melanie.

Yeah?

Can you
grab the mirror?

Yeah,
it's over there.

I want you
to see this, Priya.

The head is starting to crown.

Oh, my god!

I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's all good.

There's a dust pan

in the closet.
Everyone's wearing shoes?

I can't do this!
Yes, you can, Priya.

Yes, you can.
You're gonna push again.

No, I can't, I really can't.

You can do this.
Yes, you can.

I'm scared.

I'm right here with you.

Melanie, you're
going to hold this knee, okay?

Okay.
On the next one you are going

to lean forward.

We've got the head.

Almost there.

Good, good.

Melanie?

Johnny?

Hi, this
is Johnny's phone.

At the tone,
please record your message.

Um, hi, Johnny.

It's Melanie.

I guess I don't really
know what to say.

Um, I woke up, or whatever
here at Priya's house

and she's okay and the baby
is healthy and I'm, I'm fine.

Yeah, I, I guess I just
wanted to make sure

that you're okay.

So, let me know.

Hello?

Johnny?

Are you guys here?

What do I need?

Hey, there you are.

You look all worn out.

How are you feeling?

Fine.

Yeah?

Where's Melanie?

Oh, she left.

Did she leave you alone?

No, she uh, left when
she saw you drive in.

Oh.

That's too bad.

I wanted to say goodbye.

Did you and Melanie
go outside today?

Johnny?

You're not hungry?

Who is that?

Hi, Melanie!
Hi.

Oh, I'm so glad.

I thought I wasn't gonna
get to say goodbye to you.

Yeah, I thought
so too, but I'm glad

we get to say goodbye now.

Would you
like to stay for dinner?

Oh no,
that's okay, I can't.

I um, I have some stuff
that I forgot here and I...

Hi.

Do you know where
Melanie's stuff is?

Yeah.

I guess these are my things.
Mm-hm.

What's that?

Found this stuff in my room.

I think it's your mom's.

Oh.

So, we can
talk about it if you want.

I think this is yours.

Oh yeah, I was
looking for that.

You can keep it.

Really?

Yeah, sure.

Bye.

Being in you made me feel

like I could do anything.

Outside there are
things that feel bad,

but there are also
things that feel good.

And if you just stay home you
don't get to feel any of it.

All right, mister.

Come in.

We better hit the road.

I'm ready.

Did Melanie give you that?

Yes.

It looks nice on you.

I know.
