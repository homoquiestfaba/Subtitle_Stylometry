Opening day of a
brand-new water park, Squeaks.

Water slides, wave pools,
perfect weather...

Hello, ladies. After you.

Me first.
Sheesh...

Come on, Squeaks. Let's go
find a place to sit, huh?

These two chairs are perfect.

Me first.

Squeaks, I know I promised you

a fun day at Splash World.

But we need to address
the elephant seal

in the room first.

Hey, who do you think you are,

pushin' us into the water,

then stealin'
our chairs like that?

I'm Slugsworthy the First.

Like my father before me
and his father before him,

Slugsworthys are always first.

These are my chairs
'cause I saw them first.

Uh, just 'cause you
saw them first,

doesn't mean they're yours.

Oh, gee, I hadn't realized.

Let me make it up to you.

You can go first, Squeaks.

Sorry, gents, but it's my turn.

What are you talkin'... -I'm a
leader, not a follower, rabbit.

Me first. Whee!

Whee!

I'm chafing! Now I'm burning!

Now, I'm chafing and burning!

I got first-degree burns.

Wait till I get my... Whoa.

Babes. Hello, ladies.

Who wants the honors
of rubbing sunscreen

all over this beautiful body?

Ew.
Hey.

Well, their loss. I would've
done it first, anyway.

Hmm, where's that sunscreen?

Right here.

Hmm.

Is that a coffee-glazed ham?

Man, I was really bacon.

That Slugsworthy is
somethin' else, eh, Squeaks?

This is your favorite part
of the park?

Move it.
Look out!

Oh, my God!

Oh, man. I love water cannons.

A-ha!

Oh, no, I'm so scared
of your teeny-tiny squirt gun.

Tell you what,

this time, and this time only,

I'll let you go first.

Take your best shot.

Oh, that's convenient.

I'm sure his lips
are sealed. Get it?

Nobody makes a fool
of Slugsworthy the First

without getting
my permission first.

Squeaks.

Huh?

Huh?

Huh? Huh? Huh?

Ready, Squeaks?

Yoo-hoo.

Ha-ha. Now, I got you... Whoa!

This is a bad first.

Let's get 'em, boys!

Oh, no.

Look at that, Squeaks.

I can honestly say
that's a first.

Welcome, <i>madame.</i>

Ahem, the specials, please.

Just the specials.

Of course. May I recommend
the steak, <i>madame?</i>

It has been gently massaged
by seven shiatsu masters.

No, I'd eaten that before.

How about a thousand-year-old
quail's egg?

With baby field greens grown
in zero gravity

on the international space station?
Eaten it.

Have you had
the Harvard-educated unicorn

in 30-karat-gold sauce,

stuffed with crisp
thousand dollar bills?

Eaten it! Eaten it! Eaten it!

Query, what haven't I eaten?

<i>- Rabbit.</i>
That's what I want.

But, madam, rabbit is the
only thing we do not have.

Query, find me the wildest,
freshest rabbit in town.

<i>Get out of your chair.</i>

<i>Walk 30 feet to door.</i>

<i>Turn right on Sixth Avenue.</i>

<i>In 14,577 feet turn left
at Albuquerque.</i>

I'm hungry, too, Squeaks.

But without our manners,

we're no better than animals.

There. Now, we can eat.

<i>You have arrived.</i>

And you are?

I'm here for the rabbit.

Sorry, lady, but we're just about to...

Hey!

What do you think you are doing?

Done. Now clear this away
and bring me a menu.

If you're looking
for a restaurant,

you've come to the wrong place.

<i>This is the right place.</i>

Now, look, the only thing
left in the world

that I haven't eaten is rabbit.

I'm not leaving...

...until I've had
all the rabbit I can stand.

Why didn't she say so?

If rabbit is what you want,

rabbit you'll get.

But first, a person
of your eating expertise

will no doubt require
a battery of appetizers

to prepare the palette.

Huh?
<i>- Voila!</i>

Ugh! What is all this?

We have a side of aged
cherry yogurt reduction

with a dusting of coffee
grounds and sofa crumbs...

Ugh! - ...Besides some
decomposed cantaloupe rinds

in a ketchup glaze, served

over a bit of crisp gas station receipts.

Finally, room temperature
fat trimmings... -Ugh.

Wrapped in a vinegar-soaked
paper towel,

all covered
in previously live ants.

<i>Bon appetit!</i>

These appetizers
aren't fresh at all.

Now, let's have that rabbit,

and I want to see it
before it's prepared.

I want it fresh.

You won't
be disappointed, ma'am.

I personally vouch
for the rabbit.

Pleased to meet you, doc.

Oh. Hello.

What you're getting here
is premium Grade A rabbit.

I see a therapist twice a week

and drink nothing
but mineral water.

I teach Pilates,
and my credit score is 836.

Well, that all
sounds exceptional.

Don't worry about me.

I volunteered for this.

It's an honor to serve.

But I've only got
one favor to ask.

It's my mom, you see.
I'm all she's got.

Would you mind checkin'
on her now and then?

Of course,
it's the least I can do.

You're a real piece of work.

I think I'm ready now.

I'm getting warmer.

I'm getting warmer. Oh...

That's hot!

I'm almost done now.

Here I go!

Going, going, gone.
No!

Rabbit, please for...

Oh! This is the worst
restaurant I've ever been to.

Where's the manager?

I'm not telling.

Query, where is the...

Uh, Query? Did you see my phone?

Is this it?

Query. Find me the manager
of this restaurant.

<i>Proceed 10 steps.</i>

Open the refrigerator.

Nicely done,
Squeaks.

The old switcheroo.

<i>Eat a jar of mayonnaise.</i>

Um, this will take me to
the manager's office? <i>-Yes.</i>

<i>Proceed to exit.</i>

<i>In 20 feet, eat a fried pickle.</i>

<i>- Continue 30
feet to food trucks.</i>

<i>Proceed to drink the grease
traps of each truck.</i>

<i>Take a spin
on the carnival ride.</i>

<i>- Proceed 30
feet to destination.</i>

<i>Arriving at destination.</i>

How can I help you, <i>madame?</i>

Ah, yes, the rabbit.

We'd like to make this right

by offering you
the full rabbit dinner

free of charge.

No, I just... Check, please.

Thank you.

And here's your phone.

Whenever you're ready, sir.

Keep the change.
<i>- Merci, Monsieur.</i>

Don't mention it, my good man.

After all, without our manners,

we're just animals.
