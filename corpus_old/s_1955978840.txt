Okay, My turn.

Ready?

One two three.

What are you dicks laughing at?
Nothing.

You making fun of me?
No, Alan.

We were just lighting farts.

Yeah?
Let me see.

Whoa, that's great.

Let me try.
It's not my lighter.

Like I care. Get out of here.

You better not break my lighter, Alan.

Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?

Piss on me like you do to your bed every night?

Shut up.

No, you shut up!

And if you say one more word tonight, I'm gonna punch you.

Now watch this.

How was that, huh? Was it big?

I'm not sleeping in that bed anymore.

What's so funny?

Talk about your hershey squirts.

Yeah?

How funny is this?

Put it out!
Put it out!

Put it out!
Put it out!

Now that's a flame.

Put it out!
Put it out!

Are you out of your fucking mind?

Let go!

Really, Alan, are you that stupid?

Not as stupid as you, you big penis.

Is that so, fat boy?

Hey, Randy.

You ass stinks.

Alan, get back here now.

I'm gonna teach that little prick a lesson, he won't forget.

Yeah right. He always gets away with everything.

No, he'll get his, boys.

He'll get his.

Chew your food.

I chew my food. Why you got to treat me like a baby?

I'm not treating you like a baby. Chew the food.

Randy, tell Alan to stop it.

Knock it off, idiot.
He started it.

Did not.

You know, Alan...

...if you weren't such a wanker...

...then maybe your brother wouldn't be moving in on your girlfriend.

What are you talking about?

Check it out.

That was funny.

He's just talking.

Oh yeah, he's talking to her alright.

Be quiet already.

He's touchy, isn't he, boys?

Alright, everybody, listen up.

Quiet down. Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Let me handle this, Frank.

Hey, shut it!

Thank you, doll.

Today we are very fortunate to have with us..

..one of our local policemen to talk to us firsthand

About the dangers of smoking.

Douchebag.

Asswipe.

Now that's enough.

Try not to act like animals for a minute.

You think you guys can do that?

Eat me.

Mr. Spassky?

How'd you like to clean those tables all by yourself today?

No, sir.
Then shut up!

You're such a fucking spaz.

You kids have no respect for anything.

It's alright, Frank.

I'll take it from here. Don't worry, kids.

I'll be brief so you can get back to this delicious food.

Hey, why are you talking like that?

I'm glad you asked.

After 35 years of smoking I lost my larynx to cancer.

Hey, dude.

Can you play "intergalactic" on that thing?

Maybe later.

The force, luke. You must use the force.

Spinelli, give me that thing right now.

Hot potato.
Trace.

What thing?
It's no big deal.

You know what? Forget it.

These kids appreciate nothing.

This stuff sucks. I want something else to eat.

Too bad.

I can't eat this junk. I'll throw up.

Then you'll throw up.

Now eat the chicken before i shove it down your throat.

No, you eat it.

Eat the fucking chicken, Alan.

Leave me alone.
Eat it!

No!

Alright, that's it.

Clean it up.
No, you.

I said clean it up.
Let go of me.

Clean it up now.
Let me go.

I see you two are at it again.

He's throwing food at the other kids

And then he threw his plate on the floor.

He's hitting me for no reason.

Stop lying, Alan.
You're the liar.

Alright, calm down.

Alan, why don't you just come with me, alright?

You're such a pussy, Alan.

Hey, Randy.

Your ass stinks.

Alan, I thought we agreed

You were gonna work extra hard to behave yourself.

I'm trying, Ronnie.

But everybody keeps picking on me 'cause I'm different.

No one thinks you're different, Alan.

Why don't you just start trying to be a little more cooperative, okay?

Okay.

Hey, do you think i could go to the kitchen and get something else to eat?

Sure you can. But just remember what we talked about, okay?

Okay, I promise.
I'll talk to you later.

Quit it, Alan. You retard.

Good shot, Bella.

Did you see that?
Leave it alone, Petey.

What'd you do that for?

'Cause your face look like my ass. Problem?

I hate you, Bella.

Oh, you're breaking my heart.

Eat this, you fat shit.

You puss bag!
Down, girl.  Down, girl.

Easy easy. Ronnie is right there.

Just chill.

Move it,
Fatty fat fat.

Sorry.

Dick.

Well, look who's here.

The camp problem child.

Hey, Charlie. Can I get something else to eat?

I'm on my way out, little man.

Mickey will take care of you.

Great.

Hey, Mickey, didn't I tell you to put the goddamn trash bags

In the dumpster? I'm infested with rats in here.

Alright, don't blow an artery, okay?

Just make sure you do it this time.

I said I'd fucking do it, alright?

Jesus christ!

Should've fired your ass a long time ago.

Yeah, you keep mumbling, old man.

What do you want, fatty?

I guess I'll have some ice cream.

Hey!
Ice cream, my ass.

I'll decide what you're gonna have. You ready?

Egg salad or Tuna salad.

That stuff sucks. I want ice cream.

Well, that's tough shit, ain't it?

Now hurry up, I'm busy.

And stay the fuck out of my freezer

Or I'll cut your tiny little balls off.

Can we get more juice please, Petey?

Sure.

You little asshole. What did I just tell you?

Leave me alone.
"leave me alone."

You know, you're such a little girl, Alan. Get the fuck out.

You suck, Mickey.

I suck?

Ow! You fucking bastard!

I said get out.

Oh yeah?

What's this?

That was nice aim, asshole.

Ow!
Mickey.

You fuckhead!

Holy shit!

My god!

Are you insane?

He was throwing eggs at me and he was hurting me.

So for that you try to kill him?
Let me go, you big pussy.

You don't tell me what to do.
Let me go!

You all suck. I hope you die.

What a douche.
Shut up, Mickey.

I'm sure you started all this.

Yeah, whatever.

Michael, go get your brother right now

And bring him to Ronnie's shack on the double.

Hey, he's only my stepbrother.

I don't give a damn what he is.

Just do it.
Yes, sir.

You see what I have to put up with here?

You'd think these kids would appreciate

How hard we work to give them a nice summer.

Goddamn kids.

Hey, dickhead, slow down.

Alan. Alan.

Leave me alone.

Pain in the ass.

Come on, Alan, I've got to take you back.

No.

You know, I'm really getting tired of taking care of your ass.

I'm not going back, Michael, Ever.

Everyone's always picking on me.

Stop crying, you big baby.

"Everyone's always picking on me. Nobody likes me."

Be quiet.

Still dicking around with the frogs.

They're my friends.

Yeah, right.

Whoa, look at this mother.

What are you doing?
What?

You hurt him.

If he's hurt bad, i'll fucking kill you.

Alan, they're fucking frogs.

They're my friends.

They don't care, if I was sick once.

They like me anyway.
Here we go again.

How long you gonna milk this rheumatic-fever bullshit?

The doctor said there'd always be effects.

Yeah, you'll always be an asshole.

Now let's go. Frank wants us back at camp now.

I'm not going.
Oh, yes, you are.

I said I'm not going!

And I said you are. Now let's go.

No!

You little asshole.

I'm gonna kick your ass.

Get out of here.

Cut the shit, Alan.

I'm not going back.

Come on, Alan. Give me the knife.

Come on, Alan. Give me the knife.

Give me the fucking knife.

You're fucking nuts, Alan. And you know what?

I don't give a shit what you do anymore.

Have a little din-din.

Mickey's turn to eat.

Yeah.

"hey, Mickey,

What's with the fryer?

There more oils on it than in it."

Why don't you just suck my dick, you old bastard?

Oh fuck! Charlie?

Huh?  Is that you? Put me the fuck down, alright?

This isn't funny. Come on, put me down.

Charlie, put me the fuck down. Ha ha ha.

Hey! Hey, I'm not kidding with you now.

Who the fuck is that? Louis?  Huh?

Tracey, you better tell him to put me the fuck down.

This is hot oil here, alright? I'm not joking around now.

I'll kick your fucking ass, you little bitch.

Put me down. Come on, who the fuck is that, huh?

Hey, what the fuck are you-- What the fuck are you doing?

Stop! Hey, what the fuck, man?

Stop. This ain't funny, man.

Whoa! What the fuck?

What, are you crazy? Tell him to put me the fuck down, Louis.

Hey, what the fuck, man? Stop, this ain't funny, man.

It's oil. Put me the fuck down.

Please put me down.

Put me fucking down. Stop!

I'm getting tired, man.

Please put me the fuck down.

Put me the fuck down! Put me down!

Ow!

I wouldn't build up my hopes if I were you, charlie.

Like my mama said: you don't ask, you don't get.

What's that thing?

Frank's building an aviary for Matilda.

Looks like a shrine.

You know how much he loves that bird.

Come in.

Charlie needs to speak to you, Frank.

First say hello to Matilda. She's very excited to see you, Ronnie.

Hi,  Matilda.
Say hi, Matilda.

Hi, Matilda.
Isn't she so smart?

I love you so much.

I love you so much.

I love you so much. Aah.

I think she's starting to look a little like you, Frank.

Is that a bad thing?

Charlie's having problems in the kitchen again, Frank.

It's that damn fool Mickey.

Boy is useless, as tits on a bull.

Just this night I told him to get the garbage out

Before it attracts the rats into the kitchen.

Garbage is still there and he's long gone.

So fire the guy. He's probably on drugs anyway.

Then we'll have to offer more money otherwise all. We'll get is another Mickey.

Look, fellas.

I'm not paying any more money

For perfect attendance.

That's clear, huh?

Now are we done here? 'Cause i got things to do.

We still didn't do anything about the rats by the compactor.

Again with the rats?

They're a health risk, Frank. And I say we do something about them.

Don't forget, I own a piece of the place too.

Yeah? And don't you forget it's a very small piece.

That's not fair, Frank.

I'm just playing with you, Bubbie.

Come on. Charlie, replace that guy in the kitchen.

We'll talk about the rats later, I promise.

Fine.

Oh, look at my baby.

Say goodbye, Matilda.

Goodbye, Matilda.

Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,

I have to use the John.

Too many beans in that casserole, Charlie.

Yeah, right.

Tightass motherfucker.

Hey, I didn't know you and Frank were partners.

Only a junior partner. And believe me,

There's nothing more junior than being a junior partner of Frank's.

Dude, you're taking, like, forever.

I'm trying, man.

You know this dried cow manure is hard to roll.

Who are we gonna get to smoke it this year?

I don't know, man.

We already got spaz last year.

That was awesome.

I laughed my ass off for a week.

I'm sure we'll find another trusting soul around here somewhere.

Hey, you're licking, like, cow shit, man.

Whew. Good save, man.

Yeah.

Shut up, doofus.

Hey!
Thanks, pee pee.

Why don't you go bother Karen? Everyone knows you like her.

Why, is she here?

She's over there.

Oh no.
What?

Oh look. It's Karen's, Little crush.

Does he ever take those freakin' pants off?

Yeah, it could be, like, 500 degrees out and he'd still have them on.

Good one, spaz.

Just ignore him, okay? I don't want him coming over here.

Oh, don't worry. Yo, Alan, come here, buddy.

Really?

Yeah, come on.

Awesome!

See you later, losers.

Thanks, T.C.

Yeah, no problem.

Now you guys have to promise to stay.

I don't want to be left alone with him.

Are you kidding? I love Alan.

Hey, guys. What's going on?

Hey, dickwad. What's that on your shirt?

What?
What a tool.

Come on, guys, let's get something to eat

Before Bella wipes out the canteen.

Oh, that's really cute, guys.
Thanks.

Thanks a lot.

Hey, Karen, how are you?

Great, Alan. I'm great.

Want something? Some soda, licorice?

I'm fine, Alan. I'm just fine.

Okay.

What's that smell?

What smell?

Oh my god,
It's you.

Me?

Oh, Mickey threw eggs at me before.

And you didn't change your clothes?

God, i don't know who's more disgusting, you or Mickey.

You mean you don't like Mickey either?

Are you kidding? He cornered me in the kitchen

One night while i was doing cleanup.

Good thing Ronnie walked in.

He's lucky I wasn't there.

I would have killed him if he'd done anything to you.

Wow, Alan. You must have some pair of balls.

Let go!

Do you really think that I forgot what you did to me at dinner tonight?

Do you?
Ow, it hurts!

That's the point, assface.

He ain't got much of a package there anyway.

That was funny, Bella.

But what i'm in the mood for is a purple nurple.

Stop! Let go!

You want more? You want more?

Stop!

Hey, T.C., have a nice trip?

Fuck you, Bella.

You're fucking dead, Alan.

What, do I got a rumble going on here?

T.C. was picking on Alan again.

That's bull. You saw him push me.

He's always picking on me.

You don't belong here anyway. Get back to your cabin.

Don't touch me.
You don't talk back to me, young man.

I'm not one of these little boys, you can push around.

Now you get going before I kick your behind all the way down the hill.

I'm going.

A little faster.

Your ass stinks.

What did you say?
Nothing.

Night, Alan.

Zip it up, T.C.

And stop acting like a putz.

Hey, weed.

What are you guys doing?
Get out of here, man.

Yo, dude.
What?

Oh yeah.

Hey, Alan.

You, um-- You party?

Yeah, I party.

You want to try some really good shit?

Yeah, sure.

It just so happens i got a nice fatty right here.

Be quiet.
It's a joint, schmeckle.

Oh, I thought you said something else.

Light him up, stanny.
Covered.

Just be careful, man. This shit is really strong.

What it is, gold?

No, man. It's just some really good brown.

Come on, man. You got to take big tokes

And hold it in, otherwise you're wasting it.

Sorry.

It's good, huh?

Yeah.
Here.

Whoa, hold on, man.

You got to take a really big hit, you know?

You got to catch up with the rest of us.

Okay.

You got a buzz yet, Al?

Yeah, this stuff's awesome.

Well, isn't this cute?

Alan's giving stan some head.

Is it good, stan?

Sweet, dude.

I got an idea.

I think from now on we should call Alan "blowjob."

Hey, I like it.

What do you think, blowjob?

Don't call me that.

Hey, blowjob, you don't look so good.

What do you expect, man?

Blowjob just smoked an entire joint full of cowshit.

No way.

You're full of shit, weed.

No, blowjob, you're full of shit.

Don't call me that.

Oh, we're sorry... Blowjob.

Shut up!
Knock it off.

Tell them to stop calling me that, Petey. Tell them to stop.

Come on, Alan. Let's get out of here.

Excuse me.

His name's blowjob.

Shut up, weed, or I'll tell Ronnie what you guys were just doing.

We're cool.
Oh, busted.

Shut up.
Stan, damn, it smelled really gross.

What's going on?

What do you think's going on?

These hooligans were making fun of Alan again.

Oh, we were just kidding around.

Right, blowjob?

Tell them to shut up.

Alright, you four get back to your bunks

And don't move a muscle till I get there.

Come on, Alan. You need to go to bed now.

Hey, boys.

Dude, how many joints..

..you think we can smoke in one night?

Really. Stan's wiped.

And look at Evey.

Hey, I told you guys, okay?

I really want to get whacked tonight.

You're just pissed

Ronnie gave us so much shit about Alan.

Yeah, like I care.

Hey, there's gas in those cans.

What are you trying to do, blow us up?

Really, dude.

Get off the rag, man.

Eat me, Stanny.

I think we're gonna go, guys. Evey.

What are you talking about? It's only, like, 2 O'Clock.

Hey, we just want to go, okay?

You know, Sue,

Just do whatever you want.

Gee, thanks, weed.

Come on, Evey. Time to go.
What?

Come on.
No.

Weed, come on, dude. Let's roll, man.

You're falling out.

Plus, If Ronnie catches us down here we'll really be screwed.

Fuck him, alright?

I'm staying.

Whatever, man. I'm out of here.

Sue, wait up.

Bye. Bye, go away.

Leave.
Hey, wait up.

Bye. Go away.

Fuck them.

Hey, man, what are you doing?

Fuck off, Stan. Let me sleep.

Weed!  No way!

No!

No fucking way, man.

No!  Weed!

Weed!

I told you to get those campers back to bed now.

Now get moving.

It'll be alright.
No way!

I got a bad feeling about this, Frank.

Yeah, and I feel good. We're gonna lose over half the camp.

That's thousands of dollars.

We found this near the body.

See, what did I tell you? Drugs.

Goddamn drugs.

I think there's more to it, Frank.

Here we go again.
What does that mean?

Every time something happens around here

He thinks he's back at camp Arawak.

Arawak? Isn't that where that kid went on a killing spree?

Yeah, that's the place. Ruined the camp business for years.

Ronnie was the head counselor over there.

What happened to that kid?

What happened to the kid?

Her name was Angela. Last I heard she was locked up

In a sanitarium outside rochester.

He was locked up.

What was that?

The girl Angela-- Turned out she was a 'He'.

And the kid pretended he was the sister who died years before.

You believe that?
Sounds pretty bizarre.

You sure he's still locked up?

As far as I know.

You could talk to her cousin Ricky.

He's up in Anslin.

Maybe I'll do that.

We're about wrapped here, sheriff.

Thanks, Al.
You got it.

Sheriff, thanks for everything.

But we've got things to do.

So you let me know if anything comes up, Okay?

Will do.
Okay, thanks.

Are you out of your goddamn mind?

Sorry, Frank. I just didn't think--

Don't think. Now you listen to me.

I don't want to hear another word about this Angela crap.

Understand?
Yeah.

Now clean up this mess.

Look at these campers out here.

We're lucky if we're not closed down by tomorrow.

Alright. I'll take care of it.

Goddamn idiot.

You're so stupid, Alan.

Alan!

Come on, Bella. It's your turn.

You know I hate this stupid-ass game.

What the fuck?

Man, this thing's heavy. Ow!

Alan, get your fat ass out of here now.

Let go, you big lezbo.

Go play with your own bunk.

I just wanted to ask Karen if she would go to my secret hideout with me.

Whoo, secret hideout.

Don't encourage him, Dina.

Please, Karen? Just this one time.
Please?

Alan, just go away, okay?

I'm not leaving until you say yes.

Alan!

Karen, would you just say yes so we can get rid of him?

Are you kidding me?

Come on, Karen. Or he's never gonna leave.

If he don't leave soon, I'm gonna shove this mallet up his ass

And it ain't gonna be pretty, girls.

He's ruining the game, Karen.

This is unbelievable.

Oh, come on, Karen. Give the kid a thrill.

I can't believe you guys are doing this to me.

Come on, it'll be fun.

Yeah, really.

Okay, Alan, you win.

Awesome!

But only if I can bring someone with me.

Okay, who?

Marie.

What?

Marie? I like Marie too.

I'll see you at the lake?

I can't wait.

Now could you go or do I have to smack you?

I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

See you girls later.

You too, Bella.

You little ass eater.

Hey, Bella. Your ass stinks.

Wait a minute. What just happened here?

You got hosed.

Let's go, boys. We got paintball.

Hey, guys, wait up.

Cut it out.

Stop it, dick.

Guys, wait up.

Guys!

Alan, over here.

Blowjob, this way.

Hey, shut up.

Uh-oh.

Hey, guys, I found them. Let's go.

Come on, you pussies. Let's go.

What are you guys doing?

Guys?

Guys, what-- What are you doing?

I hate you!

I hate you so bad.

Hey, I'm working here.

You must be Ricky.

What's with the voice?

The big C. Too many of those.

Ain't life a bitch?

So are you Ricky?
You know I am, so cut the shit.

The head counselor over at camp manabe

Said this accident that happened over there

May be related to your cousin Angela.

Oh yeah? That's a good one

Considering she's been locked in a rubber room for the last 20 years.

You sure about that?

Yeah, I'm sure. I go to see her every few weeks.

I'm the only one who goes to see her.

You mean him.
What?

Him.

Angela is really a man now, isn't she?

You know what? Fuck you.

I got to get back to work.

If anything else happens I may be back.

That a threat?
No, I just might need your help.

Knock yourself out, deputy dawg.

One day I'll show them.

They'll all wish they were my friends.

Well, we're here.

I can't believe it.

What are you doing here?

That seems to be the question of the day.

Well, come on, come on, sit down.

Hey, you guys want some soda?

Um, yeah, sure. Why not?

Ew.  What's with all the frogs?

Oh, they won't hurt you.

They're my friends.

Besides Michael, you and Marie

Are the only two people that have been here.

Gee, what an honor.

So what do you do around here, Alan?

It seems kind of lonely.

What is it?

Oh my god!

What?

Where are you going?
You are so sick.

No!

Oh no!

Oh no!

No no no!

No no no!

No.

What's happening?

Who did this to you?

That was fucking awesome, dude.

Well, you know the old saying, Vinny.

There's nothing like a finely sharpened knife when you're skinning frogs.

True that.

You did this?
Shit, yeah.

But why?

Why? 'Cause it was freakin' cool, man.

Sure scared the shit out of Karen and Marie, didn't we, buddy?

Brought it home, brother.

How could you?

How could you, you fuck?

Kiss my ass, sick boy.

Don't say that.

We're out of here, Vinny.

Our work here is done.

I hate you. I hate you so bad.

Karen!

I got to tell Karen.

Karen!

Oh hey, where are you going, honey?

Karen!

Karen, you don't understand.

Get away from me, you freak.

Karen, you don't understand.

It wasn't me, Karen. I didn't do it.

Hey, blowjob's here.

Stop calling me that. 
Karen!

What?
Linda, get him away from us.

Alan, you need to get out of here and leave my girls alone.

You shut up. I have to talk to Karen.

You crying again, fat boy?
Get out of here, Randy.

Oh, you got me really scared.

Listen, Karen, I didn't do it.

Look, I didn't do it. I love my frogs.

Just stay away from me, Alan.

I need you off my dock without a bathing suit.

I was just trying to talk to Karen.

I don't care if you came here to talk to your aunt Tilly.

I need you off my dock without a bathing suit on.

Alan, beat off.

Screw you, you ugly whore.

Hey, Alan, that's no way to talk to ladies.

Boys, wedgie.

Whoo!

Alan!

Easy, Alan.

Calm down. Everything's alright.

Oh look, now there goes a handsome couple.

You're a fucking bitch, Linda. You know that?

Oh, that really hurts coming from a skank like you.

I hate them. I hate all of them.

I wish I could kill them.
Take it easy, Alan.

You're gonna make yourself sick.

It's a little late for that.

Fuck you!

What's going on here? What happened to him?

What do you think happened?

When are you gonna do something about this?

Come on, Karen. Don't be such a wuss.

Yeah, you know we can't do this without you.

I don't know. Hasn't he been through enough already?

Come on, just a little joke.

And besides, he likes it when we make fun of him.

That's right. He thinks we like him

Because we take the time to beat the shit out of him.

Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense, T.C.

Come on, Karen, it'll be a riot.

Hey, shush up. Here he comes.

Evening, b-b-b--

Blowjob.
You better shut up, T.C.

I didn't say anything.
Lay off, T.C., okay?

Come on, doll. Better hurry up.

We're gonna miss our reservation.

Oh, sweetheart,

You really should have thought about that 15 minutes ago.

Hmm?

Come on, we're gonna be late.

Come on.
We're gonna be late.

Why not?

How's my little baby, huh?

You be a good baby while daddy's out, okay?

Okay, my sweet Matilda?

Your ass stinks.

What did you say?

Your ass stinks.

That son of a bitch.

Frank!

Frank, where are you going?

Yo, big bird.

Lemon boy, Mr. Meringue.

Out the door.

Can I get ahead of you, Toby? I'm kind of in a hurry.

No, Alan. Wait your turn just like everyone else.

Cut it out, Alan.

Alan, behave yourself or I'll have to ask you to leave the line.

Yes, ma'am.

You're so gross, Alan. I'm telling.

Ow!

What was that for?
Shooting spitballs at me?

No.
You better not be.

Who did that?

I knew it was you.

Oh, way to go, penis lips.

Yeah?

Fuck that shit. You don't want to be messing like that, Alan.

Yeah, I do.
No, you don't.

Yeah, I do.
No, you don't.

Yeah, I do!

Now that's gonna cost you some shit.

I told you to stop picking on me, you fat pig.

You little punk, what did you do to Matilda?

What are you talking about?

You corrupted my bird Matilda.

I didn't do nothing to your fucking bird.

Don't lie, Alan. You just told us all about it.

Fat fucking liar.
You watch that mouth of yours.

Let go of me.
I'll let go of you.

I'm gonna kick your ass out of this camp so fast

You won't know what hit you.

Let go, you fucking dick.

You get back here.
Your ass stinks.

Frank's a real jerk, Isn't he?

Yeah, he really is.

Listen, Alan,

Some of the girls and I were playing spin the bottle behind the stage.

And, um, we wanted to know if you want to join us.

Really? You mean it?

Yeah, sure.

Wow, I don't believe it.

Yeah, come on.

Awesome.

Here we are.

How come all the lights are out?

Um, you always play spin the bottle with the lights off.

Oh.

Come in.

Shut the door, Alan.

Hey, where's everybody else?

Don't worry. They'll be here.

Karen?

Karen, you there?

Right here, Alan.

Just getting a flashlight.

Oh, okay.

Hey! Hey, stop!

Let go! Let me go!

What's going on?

What are you doing?

What's happening?

Get away from him, god damn you.

You're all monsters.

Get those lights on.

Turn the lights on now.

I want to know who did this.

I want to know right now.

What do you want from me? It's my night off.

Not anymore it's not. Now find out.

Okay okay. Jesus.

I think he's finally asleep.

You okay, Ronnie?

You know, it's funny, Petey.

Every time Alan gets in any trouble, you're always there.

What's that supposed to mean?

Who are you?
Ronnie.

Who are you really? Where do you come from, huh?

Ronnie, you're scaring me.
Every single time Alan gets in trouble,

There you are, johnny on the spot.

Why is that, Petey? Huh? Why?

What are you talking about?

Oh, you know what I'm talking about...

Peter.

No, wait. It's not Peter, is it?

No, it's Angela!

Ronnie, stop it.
I'll stop it.

I'm gonna put a stop to it right now.

Ronnie.
We have to do something before it's too late

Before she kills someone else.

Take it easy now, Ron.

It's her, sheriff, I know it is.

I can feel it. She's here.

Who's here? And what the hell is this?

Angela, Frank. Angela, she's here.

I told you, enough of that crap. There is no Angela.

Yes, there is. It's her.

Oh yeah? Why don't you just go back to your cabin now?

Honestly, Frank, I don't know what he's talking about.

Go!

There's something going on out there.

Now what?

Blowjob, blowjob, blowjob...

You kids better stop that noise and return to your bunks.

Blowjob, blowjob, blowjob...

I'm telling you for the last time.

Stop that noise immediately.

Guys.

Stop it. Shut up.

Shh, quiet, Alan. Go back to sleep.

Okay, that's it.

You're all confined to your bunks for the rest of the week.

Stop calling me that.
Stop calling me that!

Take it easy, Alan.

Tell them to stop.
Tell them to stop.

Calm down, Alan.
Tell them to shut up.

Tell them to shut the fuck up!

I told you to watch your mouth.

Get away from me!

Little bastard.

Shut up!
Shut up!

Alan!
Alan!

What are you worried about? Where's he gonna go?

The boy is sick, Frank.
Yeah, he's sick alright.

And now I'm starting to wonder about you.

Alan!

You boys are all in trouble.

So did you find the little monster?

No. No sign of him anywhere.

I'm worried, Frank. You saw his condition before he ran off.

Listen, I've been in this business a long time,

And believe me, I've seen much worse tantrums than that.

Trust me, he's around.

I just hope we find him soon.

I'm gonna make a sandwich. You want something?

No, I'm gonna keep on looking for Alan.

Well, you just keep me posted.

Yeah.

Matilda.

That damn light's killing me.

Get me out of this thing.

What is this, a joke?

Untie me.

Get this--

What are you doing?

What the hell is going on here?

Ah, my neck.

Get me out of this!

What the hell's going on?

Keep it away.
No.

This is bad. This is so bad.

I don't understand why you're freaking out, Karen.

Did you see the look on his face? He's crazy, Marie.

You remember what he did with those frogs.

Come on, Marie.

Don't you see what you're doing?
Shit.

Stop bouncing around so much.

Chill out, Bella.

I was the one that lured him here.

Oh stop it. It was just a joke.

That wasn't a joke. That was cruel.

Yeah, whatever.

Hey, you guys want to go back down to the rec hall?

All this excitement has got me jonesing for some ice cream.

Like she needed an excuse.

You dissing me, four eyes?

Come on, Karen, my treat.

No, i don't think so.

Well, I'm not going, if you're not going.

Me neither.

What about you, Bella?

Fuck that shit. Take a look at that ass, girls,

'Cause that's the last thing you're gonna be looking at

As i walk through that door.

Oh, alright.

Please, Miss Karen.

Don't you want to go back down to the canteen with us?

Pretty please.

Sure.
Okay.

Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.

T.C., what are you doing?

Scoping tits and choking the weasel.

Well, get your ass up, boy.

Yeah, man, we're going on a panty raid at the younger girls' bunk.

Forget it, guys. Ronnie grounded me for the rest of the summer.

Yeah, like he'll even know.

He said he's gonna check on me every 15 minutes.

And how many times has he checked on you so far tonight?

None.

And how big a pussy are you

For even thinking about what he said to you?

Alright.

You convinced me.

Attaboy.

T.C., get your butt back in that cabin now!

Oh, busted big time.

Give the boys my regards.

Sorry, man. Later.

Jesus christ, Linda.

I think you gave me whiplash.

That was fun. Was that four-wheel drive?

No, you got to push the second stick down there.

How about the third stick?

That's kind of weird.

What the hell is that?
It's the Pumps.

They Pump the water from the lake to the camp.

So that's why they call it the Pump house.

Oh no. This is why they call it the Pump house.

Oh, real cute, Randy.

Do you hear something?
I told you, it's the Pumps.

No it's not, moron. Listen.

It's in the woods.

How can you hear anything over those freakin' Pumps?

Come on, let's go.

The Pump house is waiting.
Stop doing that.

Oh, randy, you take me to the nicest places.

Only the best for you, darling.

Yeah.

Slow down, lover.

Did you hear that?
What now?

That noise. Listen, it--

It sounds like someone's messing around by the Pump house.

Oh my god, run. It's the cropsey maniac!

You're such an asshole.

Yeah, but you want me anyway, don't you?

So why don't you come over here and give me some of that lovin'?

I'm coming.

Did you bring the sleeping bag?

Yeah, it's in the jeep.
Yeah?

Yeah, what?

Yeah, go get it.

Could you go get it, Lin? I gotta take a little winkie.

That's real romantic, Randy.

Come on, babe, It's only up the hill.

You're a real gentleman.
Thanks, Lin.

Hey, Lin, grab the beers, would you?

Hurry up. I don't want you to see me.

I think the mood's already ruined.

Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

Wait.

Hey, I'm trying to pee here.

Hey, you want to loosen it up a little?

I gotta breathe, you know.

Oh, fuck, that hurt.

Take it easy, would you?

Well well well, what do we have here?

What, are we hanging some mice tonight?

Hello? Earth to Lin, are you receiving me?

Feeling a little kinky tonight, aren't we, Linda?

Easy there. Them's the family jewels.

Hey, loosen it up, will you? It's too tight.

Linda, Linda, I'm not kidding.

It's too tight. It fucking hurts.

Hey, look, now I'm starting to lose the mood.

Linda?

Linda, you're choking Mr. Happy.

Alright, alright, this joke's played out.

Get this stuff off me, will you, Eh?

So we can all have some fun.

Linda? Linda, god damn it,

I can't fucking breathe.

And you're hurting my fucking pecker.

Linda.

Aw, Linda.

Linda, where are you?

Randy.

Linda.  Linda.

Linda.

Randy, are you calling me?

Linda.

Linda, where are you?

Linda.

Linda.

Shit.

Who the fuck is doing this to me?

Randy?

Is everything alright?

Linda? Linda.

If that's you then who the fuck--?

Alan?

Alan, is that you?

Alan, listen, buddy,

I was only kidding with you, mate.

I was just having a bit of fun, you know?

Come on, Alan, cut me loose, Eh?

Alan, God damn it, get me down!

Hey!

Hey, where are you going?

Alan, look, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to be so mean to you.

Look, I know it sounds stupid,

But if you don't cut me loose,

I will fucking kill you!

Alan, get back here now!

Oh, shit, he's coming after me.

Alan, where are you?

Linda, get down here!

Oh, shit. Oh, please please start.

Come on, motherfucker.

I can't believe this.

Piece of shit, move!

Fuck!

Motherfucker.

Damn it!

Fucking go! Oh my god.

Yes.  Yes. Thank you, god.

Alan, you little fucking bast--

Oh no.

Oh, shit.

Whoa whoa whoa.

Argh!
Fuck!

Oh, fuck.

Come on, motherfucker.

Stupid piece of shit, fucking move!

Fuck!

Oh, thank you, god.

Fuck. Fuck.

Come on.

Four-wheel drive.

You're not gonna get me, you little fucker!

What the hell is that?

Holy fuck!

Whoa!

What the fuck?

You missed it, man. What a freakin' pisser.

I must have got 20 panties.

You know, Spaz, a fucking broomstick just came through the floor

And almost hit me in the fucking head.

Look what it did to Donny's porn.

You sure it wasn't just you popping some major wood?

Don't be a dick, Spaz.

Look, there it is.

Come here and check it out.
Alright.

Yeah, I see it. So what?

Are you kidding? Look at it.

It's as sharp as a fucking spike.

Maybe.

I can't tell. It's too dark down there.

What are you talking about?

I can see it perfect.

It's not like Frank not to answer his phone. He always picks up.

Oh my god.

Matilda?
Shouldn't she be in a cage or something?

Yeah, Frank would never allow her out like this.

Your ass stinks.

Isn't that what Alan always says?

Your ass stinks.

Frank!

Frank, Frank, Are you okay?

Oh my god.

It's started again.

Who's been messing with my shit?

They're always messing with my shit.

I swear they need to get their own stuff.

They get on my nerves.

Dang.

I hate that shit.

Getting on my nerves. Dang.

Always bothering me.

I swear I hate this place.

Motherfucker.

What the fuck?

Ronnie, Ronnie, where are you going?

I'm gonna put an end to this before it goes any further.

What are you talking about?
She's back, Jenny.

That evil little witch is back.

Who?
Angela.

So why don't we wander down to the waterfront,

Watch the submarine races?

The submarine races? Are you kidding me?

Did you hear?
Hear what?

Somebody just killed T.C.
Get the fuck out of here.

No, really, they stuck a spear right through his head.

Man, It's unbelievable.

What, you believe this crap?

I have to go.

Karen, It's bullshit.

He's just dicking with us.

Karen.

Why are they making us go back so early?

They're probably doing something lame like breaking color war.

Oh, yeah, i bet that's it.

Somebody killed T.C.

Yeah, okay, Karen, that's so not funny.

Seriously. Alright, Maria, I gotta go.

Good night, Trace. That's not very funny, Karen.

I thought you said you were gonna chill.

Oh my god.

Oh, god.

Oh, god.

It's Alan. Alan did this.

I warned you about him, but you didn't believe me!

And he's gonna kill me next.

Karen, stop. Stop talking like that.

I'm next! He's coming after me next!

Karen!

Karen!

Nobody's leaving here till I find out where she is.

You're talking crazy, Ronnie.

I know Petey. You're way off base.

Oh, yeah? Maybe you're in on this too.

Ronnie, He-- He killed Bella.

What?
Bella-- She's dead.

What's happening here?
I keep telling you,

Angela's here. She's killing again.

There's no Angela, Ronnie. It was her brother Peter

And he's in custody upstate.

The killer isn't this Angela that you keep talking about. It's Alan.

Karen said Alan killed Bella and he's gonna get her next.

And he's already killed Frank and T.C.

Hey, what's all the fuss?
Alan killed Frank, T.C. And Bella.

What?
Stop saying that.

Karen thinks she's next and she ran away.

We have to go find her.
Nobody's going anywhere.

Bullshit.  I'm gonna stop this psycho right now.

You see what you guys are doing?

Now everybody get to your cabins, please.

Come on, Marie.

Well, here I am.

Is that Ricky?

Ronnie, what the hell are you doing here?

I was gonna ask you the same thing.

Barney Fife told me to come here.

I haven't spoken to you since we met last week.

What are you talking about? You just called me an hour ago.

Looks like somebody wants you here.

The only one who'd want him here is Angela.

Just stop that.

Then why is he here?
We're wasting time.

There's a killer out there with Karen and Michael.

Whoa, what the fuck is she talking about?

It's happened again, Ricky. Angela's back

And she's killed three people already.

What?
We have to find those kids.

She's right. I'll take the upper camp, you guys take the lower.

Ronnie.
Alright, let me get some flashlights.

You'd better keep an eye on Ricky.

Don't worry, I will.

Is anybody there?

Hello?

Linda, Linda, is that you?

Linda, help me.

Oh, god.

No!

Michael.
Did you find Karen yet?

Michael, it's too dangerous for you to be out here.
Did you find her?

No, not yet.
What about Alan?

Nothing.
Fuck.

Michael.
Who's the nut?

It's Alan's brother.
Is he a suspect too or am I the only one?

Hey, nobody's saying--
Bullshit.

I'm just sticking around to prove all you assholes wrong.

Come on.

Who's there?

Where am I?

What's going on?

Who's there?

Wh-- What?

What's going on?

Alan?

What--?

Alan.
Alan.

Alan, what are you doing?

Stop!

Alan, stop.

Alan, Alan, please.

What are you doing?

Alan.

Alan, please stop.

Alan! Somebody help me!

Alan, I'm sorry.

Alan, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Alan.

Karen?
Alan, stop!

Karen.
Stop!

Alan.
It's alright. He's gone.

What's going on in here?

Lower the net!

Get it off. Get it off.

Get it off. Get it off.

Get it off.

Get it off. Get it off.

Get it off. Get it off.

Get it off. Get it off.

Alan. It was Alan.

That's it.

I'm gonna take care of him right now.

It was Alan.

It was Alan.

Shh. Shh.

They're all so mean.

Why can't they leave me alone?

Why why why?

Michael, please, Michael,

Don't you start picking on me, please.

You're very bad, Alan.

You've always been very bad.

No, Michael.

I will not let you hurt Karen.

What about Karen?

I know what you did to T.C. and Bella.

What are you talking about?

You're a mean, sick-- You're a monster, Alan.

I'm not sick.
Oh, yes, you are.

Stop it, Michael.

I'm stopping you, Alan.

I'm stopping you right now!

Stop, please.

No more lying.

No more lies!

No more lying!

Michael, can you hear me?

Karen, Michael, are you out here?
Where are you?

Shut up.

You hear something?

I don't know.

It's Alan.

Alan. Come on, Alan.

I need for you to wake up.

Who did this to you?

What?

What is it?

Michael.
Michael?

They never learn, do they?

They have to be so mean all the time.

They think they can do whatever they want to you and get away with it.

But they didn't know I was here, did they?

I've been waiting a long time for this,

A long time.

In the end

They all get what they deserve.

I knew it was you.

Michael thought skinning frogs was cool.

Ask him how cool it is now.

Angela!

Oh, god.

No!

Ugh.  Oh, god.

You need a hand, miss?
Yes, please.

I have this leak and this is my boyfriend's car.

A leak? You got a flat? Okay, calm down.

Give me a second here.

He's gonna kill me.
I'm looking at it.

You have no idea. This is his car.

You got a brake leak. You can't drive this car.

I have to drive this car.
You can't drive the car.

You don't understand how fucked I'll be if I don't.

No, you have to go to a garage-- A garage.

Please, you have to do something. I have to get it home.

If I don't, he's gonna fucking kill--

Who's gonna kill you?
Okay, my boyfriend.

Forget about your boyfriend.
Fuck it!

Call him and take a cab.
Fuck.
