I don't think any of us had any
clue it was gonna go this long.

I saw the pilot and I
thought, "Oh, right, great.

Oh, my God."

Nobody really knew.
Nobody had a clue, you know.

We did the first episode
and it was fun, but...

I remember when I saw
the pilot for the first time,

and I thought, "Well,
that's kind of okay.

I don't know if it's
gonna get picked up.

I should probably go
and find another job."

It was a pretty
unanimous consensus

that I'd be looking for
another job real soon.

Well, it's okay, because
I can be a waitress.

I was supposed
to do eight shows.

It was funny because
when the show started,

I was about to turn 17

and I was gonna
go off to college.

And I remember when
the show got picked up,

I deferred a year, thinking:

"Oh, you know what?
It's never gonna go.

Who makes teen dramas?"

You know, "That's not gonna
last. No one wants to see that."

And then it turned into
weeks and months and months

and years and years and
years, and here we are.

I'm obviously not going back to
college, but who would have thunk it?

ANNOUNCER: <i>Tonight:</i>

(ANNOUNCER READS ON-SCREEN TEXT)

It's kind of scary,

first time I've been
on a big sound stage.

Here I was embarking on a show

that would inevitably
be globally successful.

Kind of scary.


You don't know whether it's actually
gonna get picked up, let alone,

do you think it's gonna be a
series that's gonna run for ten years.

I just remember hoping
that everyone liked me

and that we all got along.

You know her?
Yeah, I know her.

DAVID: She's hot.

She is the biggest bitch
at West Beverly High.

I had no idea what
to expect though.

I had never done anything like this
with a group of my peers this large,

so I was very nervous, actually.

I remember seeing Luke, because I
knew him in New York, and saying:

"Oh, man, hi. How you doing?"

And he said, "Oh, Gabrielle."
He said, "Man, I'm so nervous."

And he said, "You know,
I hope this goes on."

I was really nervous because
I felt kind of apart from them.

That I was kind of
just thrust into this,

and they were kind of looking
at me weird because of my dad.

Girls... It's the nature
of them to do this.

They sort of form
little cliques and clubs

and they get mad at each other
about little things back and forth.

Oh, yeah, there
was vicious cliques.

Yeah.

There are only so many red
dresses you can have in one shot.

I mean, come on.

We were all pretty
much the same age

or at least lying that we
were the same age. Ha-ha-ha.

And we spent a
lot of time together.

We were all very
friendly, right off the bat.

Tori is like my little sister
and that just sort of happened.

Brian and I bonded instantly
because we were the same age.

Well, you know, occas...

There were occasional groupings
here and there, that's for sure.

It was the girls
against the boys.

We had a torrid love affair, me
and Jennie, for quite some time.

It just ended, actually,
because her boyfriend found out.

Anyways... No, I'm kidding.

We were all thrown
in this together,

no one knowing
anybody really too well.

And we all started to form
relationships, you know,

that grew into family, really.

It was very hard
for me and Brian

because we were in a
relationship when I started the show.

You owe me.

What did you have in mind?


I'll think of something.

No, not like that, David. David.

My first impression
of Gabby was...

I remember meeting her,
just going, "Yeah, yeah.


You're Andrea, perfect.
Absolutely perfect."

And I remember Jason
walking in, he was so late.

And I was like, "What
are you doing being late?

This is, like, Aaron Spelling.
And this is his house, and this is..."

I was like, "Oh, my God."

There was this guy
named Priestley. Ha-ha-ha.

I love him.

He's Brandon. To me he's
just Brandon, you know?

I try to really always
see him as Brandon.

Jason does not exist.

Early on in the show,

you know, no one was
really discussing their age.

Jay... Jay was the most elusive.
No one knew how old he was.

He was probably 16 years old.
When I started the show, I was 21.

But he acted like
he was 30 years old.

Finally, one day, Shannen
comes running on set:

"I know how old
you are. You're..."

Twenty-one.
And Jay turned red.

"How do you...? How did
you know how old I am?

How do you know that?"

She's like, "I went
in your dressing room

and I looked in your wallet
and I saw your license."

And Jay just about
threw her through the wall.

That was quite an exciting day.

Jason was always very
gracious and friendly to everyone.

And the crew loves him.

Everyone loves Jason, you know.

He's... He's a good guy.

I hung out with Jason the most
when we first started doing the show.

Just...

I don't know if there
was any reason for it.

We just kind of seemed to have
a lot in common and had fun.

GARTH: And I'll
love him forever. He...

You know, I have a very special
place in my heart for Jason.


Thanks.

When I watched the pilot,

the one big thing that just
kept resounding in my head was:

"I really need to cut my hair."

I just had a bad mullet,
man. Really bad salad going.

But, you know, it was the time,
right? You know, it was the '80s.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

That's great.
Do some more.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

I'd probably would have had a more
consistent hairstyle over the years.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

You know, that classic, like,
you know, hockey-player haircut.

And I would have
cut out the blond.

It's not plastic
surgery, it's a hair color.

If you don't like it,
you'll change it back.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

There are, you know, a lot of
horrifying images that come up

but I just block
those out and say:

"I love it. I love it all."

The kinds of comments I
get from my mother are like:

"Lindsay, don't
flare your nostrils

because on our TV, they're
the size of tennis balls."

It was almost like
a weird dream,

like I was watching
myself on something that I...

I can't explain
it, just strange.

My butt was really big.

And I thought, "Man,
I gotta work on that."

My wife says I have no ass.

Really?

You know, it was loose, you know,
pretty long, but then long in the back.

I had that kind of hair
curtain going in the back.

Scary.

Oh, how embarrassing.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

Yeah, you hate your voice,
you hate your hair, everything.

You just... You know,
you can't believe

that's really what you
look and sound like, I think.

He just gets to me.
He always gets to me.

We all did bad things
in the '80s, didn't we?

ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming
up, Luke Perry reveals</i>

<i>one of the most important
requirements of being on</i> 90210.

We probably have one of the bigger
mouthwash budgets in Hollywood.

ANNOUNCER: <i>The cast bids
farewell to their favorite hangout.</i>

Thank you and good
night to the Peach Pit,

ladies and gentlemen.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And exclusive
home movies show us another side</i>

<i>of Ian Ziering.</i>

Ten years of <i>90210.</i>

And don't I look
good? Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

ANNOUNCER: <i>All when</i> Beverly
Hills, 90210: The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

STEVE: Yeah, you said
something about work.

I didn't know it
involved manual labor.


It's a... A passage.

SPELLING: Oh, I had a such a
crush on Brian when we first started.

I thought he was so cute, and I
felt so proud to get to work with him.

And to have that
bond over the years

has really helped endear, I
think, our characters to each other.

He was the most in love with
the David and Donna storyline.

You like your surprise?

GREEN: Because that was
like two people really growing.

How did I get so lucky?

You waited.

Ultimately, I just...

Just want her to be with
David and see where their...

I wish I could see where their
lives go when the show ends.

It's funny, you know, in the
nature of our program, there's...

Because we swap spit a lot.

And we jump around
on each other a good bit.

Hygiene is a real issue.

Can I make one
teeny-weeny suggestion?

What?
Brush your teeth.


You really know how to kill a
romantic moment, don't you?

A lot of deodorant gets used
on our set, a lot of mouthwash.

We probably have one of the bigger
mouthwash budgets in Hollywood,

I would guess.

I'm reading the script for the first
time and then there's, like, a kiss.

Like, "Oh, my God. I
have to kiss Jennie."

I've been through so many
boyfriends on the show.

And I really don't know her all that
well. I think it was, like, episode ten.

And I was nervous, you know?

So I said, "Jennie..." Ha-ha.

I said, "Come here."

I've never kissed more boys in
my life than I have on this show.

That is a scary concept.

"What do you say we
break the ice a little bit

just so we're comfortable
with this scene?"

And she's like, "What do you
mean? You wanna run the lines?"

I said, "Yeah,
something like that."

I've gotten more
action on this show...


And so I pulled her
into the garage, I said...

Give me some sugar, baby.

And I kissed her
a couple of times.

And it was purely
research, or so I thought.

I walked away feeling much more
than research had been done. Ha-ha-ha.

ZIERING: It's got my name
on it. WOMAN: Is that you?

I got the clothes
when they got there.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Oh. Oh. There's a reason
you wear bike shorts for these.

WOMAN: Oh, God,
is he gonna crash?

ZIERING: Whoo! GARTH:
This is our sanctuary.

When we come here,
everything's okay, you know.

And it feels better
to come to work

because you're
surrounded by your friends,

and people that love
you and support you.

It's just a really
amazing environment.


MAN: Grow...

GARTH: Our initial
audience was very broad.

Parents were watching it with
their children, their young children.

Teenagers were watching
it with their friends.

College students were
watching it with their friends.

And over the ten years,
they've just kept watching it.

Then those people
who have grown up

now have children of
their own that watch it.

Now, we have a whole
new generation of people...

Young kids, like the
13-year-olds that missed us before

are watching FX
now and catching up.

I swear that's half the
reason we're still on,

is that parents
started watching too.

It's... You know, I
know so many parents

that are addicted to the
show just like their kids are.

You know, it's just
this weird food chain

that just kept going.

I mean, how many people
now who are, you know, 25?

They started watching the
show when they were 15.

It was a big family show,
I mean, I... Everywhere...

Every time I went and did
an appearance somewhere

or talked to somebody else

and, you know, these people
would stand in line for hours

to get an autograph
or something.

You get this daughter and her
mother who is just as excited

to be up at the front of the
line as her daughter was.

And they would...

I heard that 90
percent of the time,

that the whole family
would sit down and watch it.

I think the biggest
thing that the show did

was bring families back
together on certain levels

because, ahem, <i>90210</i> was definitely,
I think, one of the first young shows

that dealt with
really serious issues.

Everybody has the same problems.
Everyone has the same experiences.

You know, the life
experiences of growing up

are the life experiences
of growing up.

Eating disorders, drug
abuse, you know, relationships,

you know, family
problems, whatever.

And we kind of just go with the
times and the issues that are current.

I got a few letters after the
first drug-addiction storyline

that my character went through

of, you know,
somebody that said,

you know, that
I... That watching...

Basically, watching me
do it made them realize

how ridiculous it was
what they were doing

and they stopped.

I was proud when we dealt
with issues that were really...

You know, that affect all of us.

You know, you do a show
just hoping to entertain people.

And when your show can make
a difference in one person's life

it's pretty huge.

Kids could relate, be able
to open up with their parents,

be able to talk about these
issues that they're seeing on TV.

GREEN: I think the show
opened doors for parents

to communicate with their kids that
they didn't have before, you know?

If you say that kids
don't need condoms

because they shouldn't be
having sex in the first place,

well, you're overlooking
two very important things.

One is that a lot of
kids are having sex.

And the other is
that they are kids.

It's so easy to look
at your own problems

and think that you're the only
one that's going through something,

and all the pain that you're feeling
in life or something going on is...

You're alone.

And, I think, to watch a show

and see other people,
you know, your age

going through the same things
kind of takes the pain out of it.

I'd like the show to be remembered
as an issue-oriented program.

One that touched a lot of
people in a positive way,

not just here in this country
but all over the world.

And then I'd like it to be
remembered as <i>The Ian Ziering Show.</i>

Yes, ladies and
gentlemen. Ha-ha-ha.

ZIERING: Ten years of <i>90210.</i>

And don't I look
good? Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

If Ian's on the set, you're
always gonna laugh.

When he comes up with
that number-two grin...


Ian on caffeine is
something out of this world.

Shaah!
Ian's off the wall.

I've seen him actually go from standing
position on the ground, in this office,

and leap onto the desk
in, like, one single jump.

I was amazed by his hair,

because I had never seen a big
white Afro like that ever in my life.

Ian, you're so bad.

(GROWLS THEN LAUGHS)

Ian would do anything
to make everybody laugh.

I have done things,


some things that I
am not too proud of.


Ahem. Check, please.

Ian Ziering has a lot of
Steve qualities in him.

He's a pretty funny guy.

Oh. What would I change?

I'd change Ian's socks.

Here's my buddy.
He'll drive me home.

Hey, buddy.
I can't...

This is my car.
Oh, my God.

GREEN: Ian's my brother.

Ian is my older brother and
he will be for the rest of my life.

And if I had to go home
the day after we wrap here

and know in my mind that I
wasn't real and honest with him

and he didn't get
100 percent of myself,

that would be possibly one
of the biggest letdowns for me.

Thanks a lot, buddy.

I'm gonna remember you for this.


ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up,
Luke Perry's tips on lovemaking.</i>

I remember him teaching me

that it's a much better,
like, sexier, sensual kiss

if you drink really, really hot
water before, like, your love scenes

and, like, when you're
making out with somebody.

I was always like,
"Let it happen to me.

Let something really bad
actually happen to the character."

So they did. They shot her,
they burned her, raped her.

They really took me seriously.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Jason talks about
what he doesn't miss at</i> 90210.

We ate the worst food
every day, without fail.

I do not miss lunch.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And the cast
takes home some souvenirs.</i>

You think I'm kidding,
don't you? MAN: Take it...

ANNOUNCER: <i>All when</i> Beverly
Hills, 90210: The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

Make sure nobody
notices. What's up?

See any souvenirs
you'd like here, Luke?

Any souvenir?

I like that Panavision camera.
I'd like to take that home.

No, no, no, that's gotta stay.

There's a reason for that.

Next roll, please.

PERRY: Everybody on this
crew can read me like a book.

I don't hide anything from
these people. I don't have to.

You wanna keep stuff from
them and you can't, a lot of times.

And that's just something
that each and every one of them

has earned that trust with me.

And, hopefully, I
have with them.

You're a superhero to me, pal.

I should wear a
medallion that says:

"Ode to Dylan,"
because you're the man.

I always thought
so. MAN: Cut. Good.

Thank you and good
night to the Peach Pit,

ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you.
That's a wrap on this set.

PERRY: It's only here towards the
end of it when we start doing these things

and there's a lot of
news crews around,

that you really have to stop and
think about the things that you say.

Here you go.
You think I'm kidding, don't you?

MAN: Take it... WOMAN:
That's the first time...

Who is that?

PERRY: The rest of the time,
it's pretty much a big free-for-all.

They'll never come...
They'll never know.

Because it's very safe.

ZIERING: Luke
hasn't changed one bit.

He is the same country
bumpkin that he has always been.

My first year with Luke was...

I remember my very first
love scene was with him.

And I remember him
taking his shirt off, going:

"Okay, that's not possible.
He's thinner than I am.

He's got a tinier waist
than me. That's not right."

Luke's really a hillbilly.

I mean, he'll never admit
it but I know the true Luke.

Luke and I would...

Whenever we had scenes
together we would strip naked

while we were doing the
scene with the other person.

The person who was off
camera would strip naked,

of course, trying to get
the other person to laugh,

like you are now.

And... Yeah, we used to do
that to each other quite often.

Oh, he's got lots
of farm animals.

I remember him teaching
me that it's a much better,

like, sexier, sensual kiss

if you drink really, really hot
water before, like, your love scenes

and, like, when you're
making out with somebody.

He is happiest
driving a tractor,

playing, you know,
with his son and wife,

and having a good time.

I was really happy that
he was coming back.

Actually, I was excited.
It felt right, you know?

It felt like, "Where did you
go? Why did you leave?

Here you are and..."

We were very happy
to have him back.

And I'm...

You know, like, he's
one of us, you know.

He's just like family.

MAN: And action.

Boy, you look great.

(BOTH LAUGH)

I am.

WOMAN: Why don't we just
start with a "Hi, is this a bad time?"

Just step right back.

My character, I think, more
than any of the other characters

just has been through the most.

Our show had always
been kind of, you know,

bad things that almost
happen to beautiful people.

That was like... That the
joke was over in the offices.

But I was always like,
"Let it happen to me.

Let something really bad
actually happen to the character."

So they did.

They shot her, they
burned her, raped her.

They really took me seriously.

Untie me, please. Tara, I
don't wanna die like this.

Well, that was scary.

The lesbian tried to pick
up on me in the bathroom,

we were locked in a house
that was burning down.

I got shot by a
drive-by shooter.


Kel, I got you. I got you.

So many. There's just
so many great memories.

Jennie's really...

She's complex and yet
simple at the same time.

I mean, if you get a chance to
know her and get to dig a little deeper,

you'll realize that she's
got a lot depth of character.

But, you know, on the day
to day, she's very easygoing.

Very carefree.

Just a very loving person.

To be completely honest,

we didn't get along when
I first started on the show.

Did she tell you that? Oh, no?


Yeah, no, no, I think
it was very strange.

"Oh, gosh, new girl. What's
this about?" kind of thing.

And that lasted for
the first few weeks.

And then it just completely...

That whole barrier
was broken down.

And I just... I got to
see the real Jennie.

I think Jennie really
got to see the real me.

And we became really,
really, really close really fast.

And, you know, she's been
a great friend ever since.

I have to stay in
touch with Jen.

Because I can't imagine Luca
Bella, her baby, growing up

and me not seeing her grow up.

We've been through a lot
together. I mean, her having a child.

And me going through lots of
boyfriends and... No, I'm kidding.

That... I'm kidding,
I'm really kidding.


That might be a little true.

I was going through
a terrible divorce.

And one day out of nowhere
she just walked up to me

and gave me a hug,
didn't say a word.

And I remember thinking,
"That's all I needed, just a hug."

So to me that was...

To me, that's what
Jennie will always be.

Here it is, baby. Today's work.

This would be me right here.

(ZIERING LAUGHS)

What would I have changed?

Uh... Well, tummy
tuck, eye lift.

Pull the ears back a little bit.

Chin job, nose job.

Caps, you know. Doing it all.

It's been great working, you know, in
the warehouse here and everything.

But not in Van Nuys.

I'm sure we would have all liked to
have been originally at the Fox studio,

but it didn't work out that way.

Yeah, there was nothing
else around us, absolutely.

There was no other shows,
no other, you know, people.

Nobody else except
for our cast and crew.

Summers are really hot.

Winters aren't too pleasant.

It's not in the best
neighborhood, but...

We wanted to be
on a lot somewhere

and have a commissary
and, you know...

We had the worst
lunches in history.

We ate the worst food
every day, without fail.

I do not miss lunch.

Try ten years of Ian's egg whites
in the makeup trailer in the morning.

You'd wanna have a
commissary too. Trust me.

Come on, stop the complaining.

Hair, makeup, where
the hell are you?

What would happen is, everybody
said, "You're the luckiest in the world."

And God knows we were really
the luckiest people on the world.

But on the other hand it was
so hard to say, "I'm scared."

Like, "I don't know
how to handle this."

ZIERING: There were a
lot of times where we just,

you know, sit back over a beer
and talk about what's happening to us

and, you know, how we were all
gonna make sure we stayed grounded.

"This is like a lot going
on, it's overwhelming.

I mean, there's no book on
this, and how do I handle it?"

One of us was gonna throw
the other person a lifeline

if we saw something wrong.

I just retreated to my house

and you know, tried to calm
my life down as much as I could.

Because things got a little
frantic and frenetic for a while.

It wasn't anything that made
me particularly comfortable.

And everybody took it differently, some
people got very quiet and introverted.

Some people
were really out there

and, you know, exploring
the limits and going for it.

And then we'd come back

in the one place that things would
balance out, would be on-stage.

Because that was the one
place that we were all together.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up:</i>

<i>We'll show you some exclusive
behind-the-scenes home videos</i>

<i>of the</i> 90210 <i>cast.</i>

I got some sideburns, okay?

ANNOUNCER: <i>Luke Perry reveals
how difficult it is to leave</i> 90210.

For me, you know,
because I've done this before,

and so I've prepared
myself for a lot of it.

Second time around hopefully
will be a little easier for me.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And which
of the</i> 90210 <i>cast members</i>

<i>has changed the
most in ten years?</i>

<i>All when</i> Beverly Hills, 90210:
The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

MAN: Action.

All right, shoot.

SPELLING: I think it's hard
to show people being friends

if they're not friends.

And we're all such
good friends and family.

And we look out for
each other so much

that what you see on TV,
us being a group, it's real.

I've come to know Tori
as an incredible woman.

Super talented.

Anything from comedy to drama,
she's got her bases covered.

I was thinking of Tori and
how much I'm going to miss her.

All the amazing things that
make up who she is, you know?

The great things,
the funny things.

The weird things, the
sad things, the bad things.

Everything. I'm gonna
miss every single thing.

She was quite shy.

But very warm.

Still, you know, some people
when they're shy like they still...

They exude a great
warmth to them.

And she's always
had that, great warmth.

She's grown up to be a terrific
young lady. She's really funny.

I wanna do a few impressions.

Whose shot is this
on? Waterman. Honey.

She's a lot of fun, and she's
really got some good style going.

And I'm finally glad she
got a haircut that she likes.


Sometimes success is not only
being in the right place at the right time,

but leaving at the right time.

I know this last show
for everybody else

is kind of how I felt about a
year and a half ago when I left.

Never ever look back.

Bye.
Bye.

For me, you know,
because I've done this before,

and so I've prepared
myself for a lot of it.

Second time around hopefully
will be a little easier for me.

Take a really long vacation.

That's the best thing.

It's gonna take a lot of
courage for everybody.

Not because they
don't want to move on,

but because you just
don't know what's out there.

You just... It's an unknown.

They're all adults and they're
all very intelligent people.

And they'll make
their own decisions

and they'll be the
right decisions for them.

I have no regrets.
Neither do I.

It was the greatest thing to
do and the hardest thing to do.

And I think that for me
now, I look at the cast,

and me as being emotional
as I am, I cry for them too.

Because I know
that they're afraid.

And I know that they're
excited and anticipating so much,

and not knowing what's it's
gonna be like to leave this cocoon,

a security, you know, something
that's so familiar to them.

Sometimes you almost wish
it hadn't gone on this long,

because, you know, it's a deeper
hole you gotta dig yourself out of.

Coming back?

Maybe someday. Maybe not.

You're in a relationship that's
a lot deeper than you thought

and you gotta say
goodbye to people.

And you didn't realize the space
that someone occupied in your life

until you really stop and think, "Okay,
they're not gonna be there tomorrow.

They're not gonna
be there next week."

And when you can really start
to get your mind around that,

it's pretty sad.

CARTERIS: Once
you've been together,

you're together
forever, you know?

Their movement, it's just an
extension of a great, great life.

Just a great life.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up:</i>

<i>The special relationship between
Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green.</i>

He had a neck, I swear to God,
I could almost palm his neck.

That was his show
of size and power,

was to carry me
around by my neck.

ANNOUNCER: <i>And the final</i>
90210 <i>cast-and-crew photo.</i>

<i>When</i> Beverly Hills, 90210:
The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

Brian's the most different. I
think we'd all agree on that.

He was shorter than me. Heh-heh.

Oh, Brian was so
little when we started.

He was like a little boy.

And now he's like this
big handsome actor boy.

He was small.

He's not anymore, but
he was small back then.

And I remember, I...

I remember him being small.

His voice was so high,
it was higher than mine.

Oh, what's in a name?

He had a neck, I swear to God, I could
almost palm his neck when we started.

Oh, little Brian. We used
to call him "Young Bri."

Yeah, I was like 5'4" when
we started doing the show.

So he would pick
me up by my neck.

That was his show
of size and power,

was to carry me
around by my neck.


It's... There's not much
story to it, he did it every day.

It was kind of a
daily thing, you know.

See him in the makeup trailer, "Hey."
Brian.

"Z, good morning." Pick me
up and, "Hey, how you doing?"

With friends like Z,
who needs enemies?

Look, I got one.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Yay.

Thanks, guys.

I need a new one. It's
broken, the light doesn't work.

I loved this crew. I've
never loved a crew more.

I mean, it's amazing.

(ALL CHATTERING)

TATA: We got the best
crew and cast in town.

I mean, everybody says that
I guess, but I really mean it.

GREEN: Aaron is real good
at finding honest people.

If you look at the people on his
shows and the people that work for him,

and you meet our crew and
you meet everybody here...

And it's an amazing
group of people.

And it mirrors what
the man in charge is.

CARTERIS: <i>When I
first met Aaron, I thought:</i>

<i>"Oh, my God, he's the
one who did</i> Love Boat.

<i>Oh, my God</i>, Fantasy Island.
<i>And he did</i> Charlie's Angels."

First of all, I... From what I understand,
he's relatively new to the business.

<i>I would say, "Hey,
keep your chin up.</i>

<i>You have a bright
future in this business."</i>

It's funny, he's amazing, he...

I mean, through every change of
time, he's done shows that just adapt.

<i>And it's the funniest thing,</i>

<i>people would think he wouldn't know
anything about doing a teen drama.</i>

And yet, he's so
hip to everything.

You know, he tells
me about fashion.

He's so in tune with all that,
and he's such a... He's so great.

When I first came in and
auditioned for <i>90210...</i>

And I remember of course
being very nervous and excited.

<i>And really thrilled
to even be there.</i>

And I remember hearing my
name being called, "Tiffani, Tiffani."

Screaming, screaming, screaming.

And I turn around and I look up in
this window with all the Fox executives.

And Aaron, like, sitting
in the middle like God.

You know, like he is, the boss,

saying with open arms, just:

"Welcome to the show. We're
so excited. You've got the job."

<i>Aaron's been sort of like, you
know, a father figure in a way.</i>

Like a
father-that-I-never-see figure.

Like he's just kind of
there like God somehow.

I've talked about
Aaron a million times,

and tried to speak in
a million different ways,

and always comes
around to the same thing:

He's one of the most
loyal men I've ever met.

He has picked up the phone
after the show had been on TV,

you know, at 10:00 at night.

"Ian, great job tonight.

Really, really sold it for
me. Working hard, guy."

<i>You know, that just puts a big smile
on my face, makes me feel warm.</i>

It changed my life, and
thank you a million times.

<i>I've always tried
to say that to him.</i>

<i>So I hope... Aaron, I
hope you get to see this.</i>

You know, I'll say I
worked with the big guy.

When this is over and done,

people are gonna be remembering,
you know, the people of television,

and he'll probably
be at the top of the list.

And I'll say, "Yeah, and that
was the guy I started out with."

Aaron was the greatest
teacher I ever had.

He taught me about television
and he taught me about producing,

and he taught me about life,
and he taught me about friendship,

and he taught me about honor.

And I love Aaron with all my heart
and I will love him until the day I die.

And he is just one of...

Is absolutely one of the
greatest men I've ever known.

Oh, you dirty people.

Okay, thank you.

I've had it.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up:</i>

<i>A special thank you
to the fans of</i> 90210.

Without them we
wouldn't have had a show.

And, I mean, I'm just
so grateful to all of them.

<i>And the cast shares their private
thoughts on the final episode.</i>

ANNOUNCER: To think what
life is gonna be like without them...

I can't imagine it.

ANNOUNCER: <i>When</i> Beverly Hill,
90210: The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

WOMAN 1: Just wait here in
the next shot. Everybody, just wait.

Here we go, ready and...

Roll, please.
WOMAN 2: Rolling.

MAN: Okay, smile. Okay.

Nice.

We have great fans on our show.

It's really very flattering

when people approach you
and they tell you, you know:

"I was late to the prom
because I didn't wanna leave.

Because your show was on.
You know, it was the last thing."

"My wife wouldn't go to the
hospital, she was having a baby.

She didn't wanna leave
till the show was over.

We had to drive in the
car watching a small TV.

When we got there, she
named the baby after you."

You know, we hear
stories like that, crazy stuff.

I have people come up and
telling me all the time, you know:

"You're such a great
addition to the cast."

And that feels so good because
they've been doing this way before I was.

And it's their show,
I really believe that.

People would send me
gifts when I had my baby.

They sent my baby
gifts. How nice is that?

Like knitting her things, you know?
They don't even know me. It's so nice.

Without them, we
wouldn't have had a show.

And, I mean, I'm just
so grateful to all of them.

Send a big kiss:

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS)

(MUSIC ENDS)

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'm gonna miss every single
thing, the good and the bad and...

I hope that people will
remember me that way.

Remember all the facets of me

and all the things that
make me who I am.

Because they certainly know a
lot of different things about me.

And that they still like me.

And they still love me is
a good thing, you know.

A lot of the funny little
antics that, you know, we did.

In the makeup trailer and,
you know, stuff like that.

Those are memories
that you'll never forget.

And I'm hoping that will be
the same for them with me.

I have my memories of them,

they'll have memories
of me, and that's perfect.

You know, generally I
wanna be remembered as...

A real person.

That's what I want
people to know me for.

That, regardless, I put myself
out and I was honest to people.

And that carries
over into everything.

The thing that I would
like people to remember

is that I came in with
a smile every day.

I'd like to think that
I'd still know them.

You know, I'd like to think
that we would still be in touch.

I don't know how realistic that
is, but I think it's pretty realistic.

I will remember all these people as
being a very significant part of my life.

I hope that that's how
I'm remembered to them.

I'm so in the present right now.

I'm so full and so nourished with
my relationships with these people

that I can't imagine thinking

of them in a way
away from this show.

To think what life's gonna
be like without them...

I can't imagine it.

I don't want them to
have to remember me,

because I want to still be
very much still in their lives.

I don't want them to have to look
back and be like, "She was a great gal."

I hope we're all still friends.

Hopefully I'm the same guy
going out as I was coming in.

We've gone through a lot of stuff,
and it's gonna make you different.

But I think if you can basically
hold on to the core of who you are,

you're really doing okay.
