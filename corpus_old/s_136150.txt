Hey, Pete.
Yeah?

It still runs.
It's amazing.

Hey, Pete.

Hey, Pete.
Hey, Pete.

Stenger.

Bring the Beamer?

You got the stew?
Still Charlie Hustle, huh?

Whoa.
How's the air up there, Stretch?

Pete, I'm sorry. Meet a good friend of mine,
Paulie Janszen.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Rose.

Pete.

Come on, Pete. Stew's in here.
Let's go, you guys.

Come on.
He likes you.

75K.

Hey, why did the blind man
stop skydiving?

It was scaring the hell out of his dog.

Now you own a piece of history.
That's the car I drove to the ballpark...

the night I knocked Cobb
out of the record books.

Don't need it no more.
I got the Corvette.

Hey. Saturday.
My place.

Game three.
I'll be there.

You too, Stretch.

Paulie, you're in.

Go. Go.

No. No.

Go.

Go. Go.

No, I said, 'What's the damn over-under? '
Hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey, you guys, could you keep it down?
I can't hear myself think, for Chrissake.

Gio can't think.

Gio can't hear.
Go powder your nose if it's too noisy.

Thanks a lot.

What?
Somebody get him a pacifier.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Could you hold on a second?

I'll just be a sec.

Yeah, so it's a dime on UCLA,

and we'll give the 14-
Arizona will never cover that.

Right.

And a dime each
on Army and Penn State.

Yep.

Go, go, go, go, go.

Yes. Yes.

Half-time. Come on, Paulie.
Let me give you the five-cent tour.

This is the trophy room,

where I keep that kind of stuff
and some of my favorite moments.

Hey, that's the 1970 All-Star game.
Winning run. Twelfth inning.

That catcher.
What was his name?

Ray Fosse.
He was never the same again, huh?

I couldn't look my dad in the eye
if I didn't barrel through him that day.

My 44-game hitting streak.
And here's my dad.

Wow.
That's your father. Yeah.

They called him 'Old Swivelhips. '

Back in 1952, when I was 11,
the old man was 40 years old,

he kicked off, he ran downfield
and he got nailed with a great block.

Fractured his hip, but Harry Rose...

crawled after the ball carrier,
made a tackle.

That was the kinda guy he was.

Kinda guy he made me into.

So what do you do, Paul,
when you're not working out? Huh?

I used to work down
at the Queen City Barrel Company.

You know, if I hadn't made it as a ball
player, I'd have ended up digging ditches.

Don't be ashamed
to earn an honest living.

Paulie's got a couple of nice not-so-honest
sidelines, too. Don't you, Paulie?

Looks like he's smart enough
not to use his own product, unlike you.

We can't all be perfect.

I would have loved
to have bet on Harry Rose.

He was a sure thing.

And you're as close
as I ever came to both, Pete.

To a sure thing and a dad.

Gio, come on.
Pull yourself together.

Pete and me met 'cause I played catch
with Petey Jr. At spring training.

Nobody wanted to toss the ball
back and forth with the kid, right, Pete?

That's right.

My pal here's got a big heart, Paul.

Come on.

Get back to the games.

Yo, Pete. How you doing?
Hey, Mikey.

Good to see you.

Paulie Janszen, Cincinnati,
Mike Bertolini from, uh...

Brooklyn.

How you doing, Paulie?
Call me Mikey, everybody does.

Nice to meet you, sir.
I got everything all lined up.

The best signing spot in the joint.
We're gonna make a killing.

My stew, Mikey. It's up-front.
Forget about it.

Hey, Pete, you hungry?
I got you a sandwich.

It's OK, I'll wait.

Good morning, Mr. Rose. It's a real honor.
Make it Pete.

Hey, Pete, for later,
I know this great Italian restaurant.

They serve spaghetti?
Maybe.

Thank you.
There you go.

It was very nice to meet you, Pete.
I hope to see you later.

Hope to see you, too. Thanks.
Bye.

I was at Shea
the day you flattened Bud Harrelson.

Huh?
Holy smokes, what a mess.

You were one of them bozos up
in the bleachers throwing beer cans at me?

Nah, nah. I was a Reds fan,
even back then.

Screw the Mets. You could
have killed Harrelson for all I cared.

That's game-worn, right?
Smell it.

So who do you like
in the Jets game, Pete?

Who do you think?
I'm surrounded by New Yorkers.

The Jets, plus three,
they can't lose.

Could you put, 'To your number-one pal
Frank? ' And sign that 'Charlie Hustle? '...

Sure.
No, no, no, no. Hey, forget about it.

It's $445 for the jersey and the autograph.
No extras.

What a pleasure this is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

It means a lot to me and...
Next.

They all love you.

Everybody loves a winner, Paulie.
Check out the Annie.

Hi, Pete.
I'm one of your biggest fans.

I can see that.

Oh.
Take care of him, will ya?

Here.
Thanks.

Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me.

Pretty good, huh?
I thought I heard you come in.

Hey.
So, how did it go?

Had 'em lined up
for blocks outside.

We've been hanging around too much.
Missed you.

This is my buddy Paul Janszen,
my lovely wife Carol.

Hi. It's nice to meet you.
Same here. You guys must be starved.

Oh, we had some burgers...
Is that perfume I smell?

...on the way to the airport. I told you
to stop wearing that smelly stuff, didn't I?

Here, honey. Buy yourself
something beautiful tomorrow.

Lucky me.
I'll be up in a minute.

First time I saw Carol,
she was at a restaurant.

She was serving cocktails in,
you know, one of those miniskirts.

She had the nicest bottom I ever saw.

She seems really sweet.
Thanks.

Behind every successful man,
there's a great woman, right?

Uh... Well,

I'd better be going.
I got a good woman waiting for me, too.

Thanks, Pete.

For everything.
Today was one of the best days of my life.

Really?
Yeah.

Here.
Oh, no...

You earned it.
My bodyguard.

We're gonna make a great team.
You and me.

Good night.

Look at those muscles.
Those eyes.

Paulie, my father always said, 'Those
are the greatest athletes in the world. '

They don't even
have to give interviews.

Listen to Paulie.
'No interviews. '

What the hell would people do
if they didn't gamble, huh?

Keep some of their money.

What?
What did I say?

Gambling's not about winning or losing.

Huh?
Right, Paulie?

It's about having the balls
to take a chance.

That's my degenerate gambler.

How much are we ponying up for
the Pik Six, huh? I'm in for 1500, baby.

I feel this one. I feel it.
I got 250.

I'm gonna go five.
You will?

All right, buddy boy.
That's a lot of money.

How 'bout it, Gio?
Come on.

Roll the dice for a change.
Take a chance.

We hit six ponies in a row, it's huge.

Step it up, come on.
Step it up.

Why don't you get Paul to do it,
you're in such a hurry?

I'd be happy to...
Sit, Paulie. You're my guest.

Hey, Pete. I'm having a little trouble with
the Beamer. It seems the engine's blown.

Really? Wow.
Someone must have driven it too hard.

Yeah.
That's what my mechanic told me.

Hm. You've got to watch it
with mechanics, though.

A lot of them are thieves.

The last race.
Our four horse is looking good.

Like money in the bank.
So we want the four horse to win, right?

Exactly.
She's cute.

See the four horse wins, Katarina, that
means we won all six - that's the Pik Six.

We win all the dough.
All right.

One minute to post time.

All right.
Here we go.

And they're off.
Breaking quickly from the gate...

I don't see it.
I don't see it.

Pink. In the back.
In the back. The four horse.

What color? What color?
What color? What color? What color?

We're gonna lose it.
No, we're not gonna lose it.

He's gonna make it.
He's gonna make a kick.

I see the kicks here.
He's got a good stride going on.

It hasn't happened yet.

The one in the last place.
He's not even in the race.

You're being negative.
Don't be negative.

Here he comes.
Come on.

Watch this.
He's gonna kick. He's gonna kick.

Come on. Step it up.
Come on. Come on.

Here it comes.
Here it comes. Let's go.

Here he goes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

Come on.
Come on.

Go. Go.

...final surge. Oh, Really
on the outside, the four horse will take it.

Yes.

Yes.
You did it, baby.

Here's the winner.
Number 4, Oh, Really.

They Come In Fives by Chill Factor,
owned by the Jenkell stable...

Hang on.

247,647 bucks.
What a score.

Hey.

No long face now, huh, Gio?

Hey, what do you say, buddy?
Go cash the ticket.

You need to show some honest income,
and the IRS ain't getting no more of mine.

I don't want no tax problems.
This will make me legit for the year.

See the favors
I do for you, Gio? Huh?

Thanks, man.
Yeah.

No hard feelings.

Hey, look at Pete.
He turns water into wine.

That's what friends are for.

Woo.

That's it.
Easy.

You never been to spring training before?
No. It's great.

It's great.

Huh.
Check out Pete.

Quicker feet.
Quicker feet.

There.

Oh. Yeah.

Eric Davis can play baseball, huh?
That's for sure.

Way to go, Eric.

Hey.

Hey, hey.

Hiya, Pete.
Paulie. Mike.

Francona's looking good.
Everybody looks good in batting practice.

How come you never pitched before, Pete?

I was too busy getting base hits.

Way to swing the bat, David.

Davis stays healthy,
you guys are gonna look pretty tough.

What do you think the odds are
for the pennant?

Better than even money if we get past
Houston. Not getting any ideas, are you?

A little one.

Hey, you got jelly on your face.
Hey, Pete. Can I have a second?

OK.
Yeah, Tony.

Buddy Bell's daughter's got a problem.
Something with her heart.

She's gonna need surgery.
He's pretty shook up by the whole thing.

Buddy.
Come here.

It's like a sauna today, huh?
Yep.

So, Tony told me about your problem.
Let me tell you something.

You take care of your little girl. Third base
will be waiting for you when you get back.

It's a scary thing, Pete.
My heart's in my throat.

Got a good doctor?
Supposed to be the best in the country.

OK.
Then everything's gonna be all right.

These guys today can perform miracles.
There's nothing they can't do, OK, Buddy?

Yeah.
Everything's gonna be all right. All right?

Yeah.
All right, kid? Get outta here.

Bring it out here
and let me have a look at it.

Pete.

Yeah.
That guy's here again.

Says he's not leaving till he sees you.

Thanks.
Way to go, Mario.

I don't understand, Pete.
Why's everything changed around here?

Nothing's changed, believe me.
It's just a lot of bullshit with the league.

They don't want any nonbaseball people
on the field, in the clubhouse.

All this time, it's never been a problem.
Well, it is now.

What about Paulie?
Why is it OK for him all of a sudden?

Look, I'm working on this.
Just give it a little time.

Gio, come on. Have I ever let you down,
Gio? Have I ever let you down?

Have I ever let you down?

I miss you, man.
Just hanging out, the two of us.

Come on.
No, come on.

Sorry.

Hey.
Come on.

Hey, who's better than us, right?

Nobody.

I gotta...

I'll see you soon, man.
Yeah. Go on.

There's nothing more beautiful.

A ballpark a couple of hours
before game time is close,

but you don't get
that earthy smell like this.

I think I'd come to the track
even if I couldn't bet the ponies.

You know, I never even
placed a bet before we met.

Really?
Yeah.

How'd you manage that?
It just never occurred to me.

I don't think it's never
not occurred to me.

It's like when you feel that solid crack,
and you know you got a stand-up double.

You're rounding first base
and you watch that outfielder.

Now it's all a matter of odds.

What are the chances he's gonna make
a perfect throw if you head for third base?

Is he even thinking third?
That's the gamble.

Can you stretch a stand-up double
into a triple?

Can you beat the odds?

It takes a special kind of person
to have that kind of confidence.

No. You just have to be willing
to be thrown out.

You could play it safe.
Stop at second base.

Most guys do.

You know, I don't think a lot of people
really know you, Pete.

What?

I don't think a lot of people...
I heard you.

Hey. Here comes Ronnie.
Play it cool with this guy.

Hey, Ronnie.
Who's this?

The guy I told you about. My buddy Paulie
from Cincinnati. He's good people.

Says who?
Says me. Pete Rose.

I don't really like meeting new people.

But out of respect for Pete here
I'm gonna make an exception in your case.

Take a walk with me,
Paulie from Cincinnati.

You been a friend of Pete's long?
Not really that long,

but we pretty much grew up in the same
area, so it's kinda like we go back...

What's that mean? 'Kinda like? '
Uh...

Why you so nervous, Paul?
What? Am I terrifying?

I'm just not really sure
what we're talking about.

I'm a cautious man. I believe in looking
both ways before I cross the street.

You a gambling man, Paul?
Now and then.

Pete's a gambling man.
Has a real passion for it.

Which, for a guy in his position,
is not necessarily a good thing.

That's where you would come in.
I'm a little lost.

You're gonna phone Pete's picks into me.
I'm gonna relay that action to New York.

You see how it works now?
Everyone's clean, once removed.

L- I think I should talk to Pete about...

Pete already talked to me about it.
Now I'm talking to you.

You can't handle the weight,
we'll find someone who can.

I can handle it.

Monday after weekend's game
is settle-up time.

Pete gets a little forgetful.
lets things slide.

It is now part of your job
to make sure that don't happen.

Nice meeting you, Paul.

All right. I'll see you next week.
Thanks for coming.

Hey, it's Tommy Helms.
Good game. Good game.

You happy, Tommy?
Yeah, I'm happy. That's the way to do it.

Sorry about that.
Bad break. It'll be all right.

My cut's 75 percent, right?
Forget about it. This is like stealing.

Just ask Pete.
OK, Mikey. Cool.

When we talk baseball Cincinnati,
there's only one team to talk about.

NBA.

Hey, Pete.
Hey.

Can I have a second?
Got a kid needs some help on the infield.

Give us a minute, will you, Tommy?

Tommy.
You deal with it.

That's why I hired you.
You're the best. Only the best.

OK.
All right.

Hey, Doug.
Tommy.

We need to talk, Pete.

In private.

Hey.

We got a problem.
Not from where I'm standing.

I'm talking about the nonbaseball
personnel in the clubhouse.

You know it's against regulations.

You came down here to mess with me
over that rinky-dink rule?

The commissioner
doesn't see it that way.

Well then, have him call me
and we'll talk about it.

My friends ain't hurting nobody.

I don't make the rules,
but it's my job to enforce them,

and from here on out, you're gonna
stick to them like everyone else.

Get out of my office.
What?

Get out... You heard me loud and clear.
We're done here.

This is going straight to Marge.
Hey.

You think the owner of this damned team's
gonna side with you?

I put the asses on all those seats
every night. Not you.

Not some bozo in a monkey suit.
Take a good look in the mirror, Rose.

You're just another 45-year-old has-been
managing a baseball team.

Nothing more or less.
Hey, Doug. Let's leave. Come on.

The commissioner's a stickler
for the nonbaseball personnel rule.

You know that.
I didn't appreciate being lectured.

Doug has a job to do,
and I'm the one who pays him to do it.

I'll stick by the rules, Marge.

I don't pay him to look the other way.
No problem. OK.

We have a good team this year.
Flattery, Marge, will get you everywhere.

But outside distractions, we don't need.

Now, I chose you to manage this team
because you're a winner.

I can say in all honesty...

that no single man has ever
meant as much to the city of Cincinnati.

And here I thought
I was gonna get chewed out.

I'm making a point here, Pete.

Can I count on you
to do the right thing?

Ms. Schott. That call...
Yes. Yep.

I'll be right back.
Margie, put it out of your mind.

Pete Rose won't let you
or the Reds down.

I'm as happy as hell to hear that.

Paulie.

Here.
You know.

Cleveland, plus nine.

Utah, minus five.

Boston, minus two.

LA, minus fifteen.

All right.
Yep.

Sacramento, minus five.

Uh-huh.

Let's go.
Come on on the inside, baby, let's go.

Come on, come on.

No. No. No.

Paul, no.
I gotta stop losing.

Hello.
This is Paul.

...needs at least a point.

...is not the man you want to shoot.

Gets the ball out off the hand. No.

They foul him with two seconds to go.

Hello.

If I don't get my money by week's
end, you're gonna have big problems.

Ron?

You're responsible,
not the other guy.

I break your friggin' legs,
no one will give a shit.

That's crazy.
That's reality, jerk off.

Get my money.

Who was that?

Nobody.

Baby, who was that?
You're white as a sheet.

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Sure you know what you're doing?
Yeah.

Go back to sleep.

Come on, let me give you
the five-cent tour. That's what Pete calls it.

Yeah, more like
the 50 million-dollar tour.

Not quite.
We're working on it.

Ron's not messing around, Pete.
He threatened me.

These guys are all the same. Bums.
A bunch of crybabies. Tell him to wait.

You tell him.

The whole idea of you being the
middleman is that I stay outside of the loop.

I thought you understood that.
I do.

But you've put me
in a situation here, Pete.

I mean, I can't have people
calling my house in the middle of the night...

saying they're gonna hurt me
unless you make good.

It's betting, Pete. If you win, they pay.
If you lose, you pay.

You're explaining how it works to me?
No. I...

You know what? To hell with it.
I'll find someone else.

I figured I could rely on you,
you were my friend, but I was wrong.

No, you're not wrong.
I was wrong.

I'm your guy.

Just let me have a little something
to hold Ron off.

Guy's got a lot of balls
calling my pal up in the middle of the night.

Maybe I'll call him up.
Threaten to have his ass thrown in jail.

No. No.
He didn't mean anything by it.

I mean,
this'll put his mind right at ease.

These guys don't give a damn about me.
The cops, they all love Pete Rose.

It's scumbags like Ron Delaplane
they wanna throw in jail.

Now, he ought to keep that in mind
next time he wants to pick up a phone.

You know what? Forget I said it.
It's water under the bridge.

OK. So, um...

What's the line on the Celtics tonight?

Huh?

I'll find out.
Good.

OK. Be quick about it. The game starts
at 7:30, and I want to get ten dimes on it.

Ten?
Ten. What? I got a stutter?

Hey. How do you get a blonde
to laugh on a Wednesday?

Tell her a joke on Monday.

Hey. Get down on the Lakers,
too. That one's a lock.

They're all a lock until the game's over.
Oh, Paul, come on.

You know I can't watch a game
unless I got something riding on it.

I ain't got no hobbies.
It's sports.

When I was a boy,
before I went to bed,

my old man made me take 100 swings
from the left, 100 from the right.

You know why? He knew if I didn't make it
in baseball, I wasn't going nowhere.

That's the way it's always been.
It's all or nothing.

We'll get 'em tonight, Pete.
OK.

Thanks.

Right there, a fountain. With flowers.
Oh, I want a fountain.

Katarina, honey, we have to go.

Oh. Is everything all right?
Yeah.

Hi. Sorry, Carol. Nice to see you.
Hi, Paulie. It's OK. Good to see you, too.

Uh... Thank you.
All right.

Let's have lunch next week. Call me.
OK. Bye.

Bye.

There you go.

Your boss should only bet
on things he knows.

Huh?

I say something, you say 'huh? '
What are you? Deaf?

You want Pete to bet on baseball?

He don't manage
a hockey team, Einstein.

So what can I get ya?
Coffee, black.

OK.

We'll have the rest next week.

Pete won't cross that line. It's something
he'd never do. Bet on his own sport.

You're so dumb,
you shouldn't be allowed to breathe.

You find that amusing?
No, of course not.

Then why are you laughing, goof?

I guess it made me nervous,
you saying that.

Come here.
Come here.

Let me explain something to you, Paul.

You place bets with me for Pete.
I take that action, I lay it off in New York.

When Pete doesn't pay me, I gotta come
up with his losses outta my own pocket.

If I don't pay them, I'm outta business,
and that's the least of my problems.

See how it works now?
How you factor into the equation?

Yeah. I've got it.
Good.

Well then, you tell number 14
to get into lockstep with reality.

'Cause no one's gonna touch him
while he's wearing the uniform,

but once that day is done,
it's open season.

As for you, big guy,
it's always open.

There.

Now you can see.

You should see yourself.
Huh?

What?

Have you ever even
thought about cooling it?

I'm on a...
Honey, I'm on a roll, you know?

I'll slow down a little. Don't worry.
Pete, take it down a lot.

And if I smell another Annie on you,
we'll meet up in divorce court.

OK, honey. I promise I will. Both. Here.
Go buy yourself something nice, OK?

Right, shopping.
Yeah, that solves everything.

We're going in circles, Pete.

Carol. Who am I hurting?
Tell me who.

Me.

Yourself.
Are you completely blind?

I like the action, Carol.
You knew that from the jump.

But this is different.
Are we hurting for money?

No, but it's not about that.
We have two beautiful homes,

a tennis court, horses.
So what? I don't care.

I drive a Rolls-Royce. I earn this money
selling my stuff to my fans.

I wanna have a little fun with it,
what's wrong with it? What's the big deal?

Baby, what's the big deal?

You're gonna do
whatever you want anyway.

Hey, Carol.
Take it. Take it.

Come on, Carol.
For me.

I'm happy
when you spend money on yourself.

Better me than the bookies, huh?

Hey, look.

I ever dip into our savings
or sell something we need,

you come down hard on me.
OK?

Until then it's just, you know, play money.
Like Monopoly.

Yeah, that's right.
You know I love you, baby.

No one else means shit to me.

I guess I must love you.
You guess?

You don't make it easy.
What's easy that's worth anything?

We've got Kal Daniels leading off,
playing left.

Larkin, Parker,
Davis and Bell...

Sure you wanna do this?
Just place the bets.

...and Diaz, Francona,
Oester and Browning.

I hope you know what you're doing.

Paul.

Come here.

I'm just betting on my own guys,
not against them. Where's the harm?

It's so against the rules, it's not funny.
Oh, to hell with the rules.

I'm creating a sure-thing situation here.

I'm just gonna want them to win
even more. I'll manage even better.

Think about it. Come on, think about it.
Guess I didn't look at it that way.

Yeah, this just proves
how much I believe in my team.

I'd be an idiot to bet against myself. Huh?
I just don't want you to get hurt, that's all.

No one's gonna get hurt, Paulie. See?
No one's gonna know the wiser, right?

Come on.
I'm number 14, baby.

Who's better than us?
Huh?

Yeah.

Oh, you watch how we play tonight.

Watch how we play.
Like nine Pete Roses out there.

Nine Pete Roses.

Ball.

Come on, Tom.
Get over the damn plate.

Ball four.

Scott.
Get Murphy up.

You sure you wanna use him, Pete?
He threw awfully hard last night.

We're up by three. It would be a shame
to waste a guy if we really don't have to.

I'm not letting Browning blow this game.
Well, what about Hume? He's rested.

I said Murphy.
Don't second-guess me, Scott. Come on.

It's my job to win games,
not to blow 'em.

The wreck
has also become home to...

...forever etched in the minds
of baseball fans as all-time greats.

Joining them in immortality
is the great Peter Edward Rose.

No one will ever forget Rose
running right through catcher Ray Fosse...

in 1970's midsummer classic.

It was only an All-Star exhibition,
but there was a winning run to be scored,

and Charlie Hustle didn't care
who or what was in his way.

Pete Rose only knew one way
to play the game - all-out, all the time.

Full measure for every one
of the 4,256 hits...

that assured his place
among baseball's best ever...

in the hallowed hallways of Coop...

Busy Friday here.
Couple of day games to tell you about.

Scoreboard's out, skip.
What do you mean, 'out? '

It's broke.
They're working on it.

Something electrical, I guess.
I mean, after all, it's just a big TV.

It's no hassle to us.
It's more of a fan thing.

Well, I hope they don't take long
in getting it fixed.

Yeah.

Something else?
Yeah.

How long we known each other, Pete?
Twenty, twenty-five years?

Give or take.
Yeah. All that time.

We've seen a lot of players come and go,
huh? Some good, some not so good.

But what always broke my heart...

was when one of the real greats
did something - you know -...

got involved in something
that tarnished their reputation.

Are you fishing for something, Tom?
Nah.

Tom. No.

I got nothing but respect for you, Pete.

Just wanted you to know that.

Tom.
Yeah?

What do you say we go see
those big repairmen, get that TV fixed?

All right. Come on. Let's go.

Stee.

Let's go, Dave.

OK. OK.
Thank you.

Stee.

You're out.

No one's down here.
This guy's way left.

That's a foul.
Foul. Going the other way.

Oh. Nice shot, nice shot.
Now you gotta get up.

Oh, damn.
Son of a...

How much this time?

I'm going to bed.

Hey, where you been, baby?
Out.

Get 'em next time.

Why not?

We're gonna go shopping.
You like shopping, right?

Come on, help me open the door.
There you go. We're gonna go shopping.

Yeah, Dada.
Dada.

Hello.

Hey, what kind of a way is that to start off
a conversation? 'I want my money. '

It's Ronnie. Huh? Oh look.
No, no, no, no. You've got it all wrong here.

It's Paulie.

Yeah, Janszen.

He's been placing all kinds of crazy bets
all over town and laying them off on me.

I think he's got
a screw loose or something.

Oh, no. I wouldn't mess with him.
He's like 110 percent crazy, believe me.

I seen him almost kill a guy once.
Yeah... He hung up.

Do you know what you just did?
The position you just put me in?

He's scared shitless.
What are you worried about?

Jeez, Pete.
That guy's connected.

He's like in the Mafia or something.
Mafia?

That's movie crap.
These bums are a bunch of pansies.

No. I've seen the look in Ronnie's eye,
you know? He means business.

What? Are you a pussy?
Are you a big pussy, Paulie?

All show and no go?

Hm?

Pete,
why are you talking to me like that?

I've been dealing with scum
like Ron Delaplane my whole life, all right?

It's his job to threaten me.
You know, say he'll cut me off.

But the thing is, what are these jerks
gonna do without guys like me?

I'm their bread and butter.
I'm the reason he's in business, see?

He's gonna get his money.
I just wanna make him sweat...

and make him
remember who's the boss.

See?

Come on, Paulie.
Who's better than us, huh?

Tell me who.

Yo, buddy.
I'm waiting here.

All right.

Safe.

He makes millions every year.
Just for a few weeks. His money's tied up.

Carol's on him like a hawk.
Oh, like she doesn't have reason to.

Why do you think
he blew off Gio, huh?

I told you I don't want you talking to him.
Pete owes him a fortune.

Gio's a full-of-shit druggie.

Maybe he got sick of being stepped on.
He's my best friend in the world.

Maybe he'd had enough of Pete's lies.
How could you even think he'd stiff me?

I don't have your faith in human nature.

Let's not talk about this ever again.

I hope we don't have a reason to.

The memorabilia biz
not so hot these days?

Just running a little short.
You know how it is.

Look,
you don't gotta play cute with me.

That jerk burned me for 75 Gs
on that piece-of-shit Beamer of his.

Frigging engine was scrap metal.

You really think Pete knew that?

I think number 14
looks out for number one, is what I think.

Well, don't we all?

What have you got here? 50?
Yeah.

Number 14's into everybody.
You know that, right?

Me, Gio, Mike.

The thing is, when you're Pete Rose,
you don't gotta pay schmucks like us back.

'Cause we're just mortals. And he's
the guy who broke Ty Cobb's record.

That's the difference right there,
Steng, see?

I don't consider myself a schmuck.
And Pete doesn't treat me like one.

Yeah, when I was a kid
I believed in fairy tales, too.

Did you ever settle up
with you know who?

No.
He still owes me about 12 grand.

So, how much did he pay you?
Nothing.

He signed a bunch of autographs for me,
you know, to sell.

Yeah. I'm getting the same thing.
But just until he gets the money.

Take it while you can.
It's better than catz.

What?

Catz. Nothing, nada, zip.

Uh, w-w...

What about the guys where you are? The
bookies. How much does he owe them?

Whoa, whoa. Don't talk like that
on the phone. I hate that.

All right, all right.
How much does he owe you? Owe them?

Between the two of us? Me and them,
about two, two-and-a-quarter.

What?
I ain't repeating it, Paulie.

Jeez, Mikey.

We're forgetting them.
He's just gonna take care of me now.

What do you mean,
'you're forgetting them? '

We're forgetting them.
They don't get nothing.

No, Mikey, you can't do that.
You're gonna have people after him.

This is what he's gonna do.
I got no control, all right?

How does he not give a shit?
What are they gonna do, Paulie?

Are they gonna whack number 14?
They've made enough off him already.

What am I gonna do, Mikey? I'm going
broke. I can't pay my rent with autographs.

Cut him off.
You got no choice.

I just... I feel responsible for him.
I can't understand it.

That's the thing about our guy. He makes
you think the opposite of what you should.

It's a powerful thing,
being around someone so famous.

It's like sunlight.
You wanna stay in it.

Hey.

Where the hell you been?
You're like the Phantom all of a sudden.

We have to talk, Pete.
Hey, grab that hose for me, will ya?

Man, did I take a bath last night.
Those damn Pistons,

they should be lined up and shot.

We'll get it back.
We'll get it next time.

I don't think there's gonna be
a next time for me, Pete.

Turn the water on.
Not too hard.

You know, I've been giving something
a lot of thought.

If I had enough riding on a game,

I mean a really fat bet,
I'd think about throwing it.

I mean,
there's easy ways to do it, you know?

I could pinch hit a guy at the wrong time
or hit and run at the wrong time.

Do you hear what you're saying?

I'm saying it's easy. That's exactly
what I'm saying. Nothing else.

Is this like another one
of Ron's great ideas?

It ain't an idea.
It's just a thought, Paulie, a thought.

Pete, this is all getting
to be too much for me.

I can't handle it.
The pressure of...

Look, nothing bothers you.

You know, I'm not like that.
Oh, yeah?

So we're not buddies anymore?
Is that it?

No.
No, of course not.

Pete, you know I'd do anything for you.
I'd go to the wall.

I just...
I need to get away from...

I need to get away
from the other stuff, you know?

The betting.

It's got me like I can't think straight.

I got you something.
You probably don't want it now.

Look at the back.

Paulie, my number 1 fan and friend.
Pete Rose.

Take it back if you want.
Get something else.

The jeweler I got it from,
he's a friend of mine.

I wouldn't.

I wouldn't trade it for my life.

Thanks.

Hey, you know what we need? We need
a night on the town, just you and me.

And some fresh tail. What do you say
you come with me to LA this weekend?

I'm... I...

It sounds great, but Katarina and all...

Oh, yeah.

OK, here.
Put it on. See if it fits.

You can see the moon
and all of its quarters.

This is the kind the astronauts wear,
this model.

Come on, buddy.
Katarina's gotta get used to it.

You're on the road with me - Pete Rose.

You don't hear Carol complaining,
now, do you?

Hey, baby. I got the Roller all shined
and polished for you. Where you going?

Egypt.

Bring me back a mummy.

You don't think she heard?
Nah, it's just her goofy sense of humor.

Come on.
Get the stick out of your ass.

All work and no play,
you know, whatever that is.

Who's better than us?
Tell me who.

Nobody.
That's right, pal. Nobody.

Nobody.

Thank you.

No.
Yes. You better come here.

Gotcha.

Open the door.
It's my wife.

I said open the door, Pete.

Let me in right now.

Right now.
Coming.

Open the door.
I hear you in there. Let me in right now.

OK.
Open this damn door.

Who is it? I'm coming.
Open the damn door. Let me in.

Carol.
What are you doing in LA, huh?

Who is it, huh?
Carol?

W- What are you looking for?

Who's next door?
Paul. You know that.

Yeah, Paul?

Katarina would love to see this.

Carol, please.

I don't wanna see him.
I don't wanna hear his voice on our phone...

or see him within a mile of a ballpark or
anywhere else you might be for that matter.

That guy, he is bad news.
He's been nothing but since you met him.

This stuff, and this gambling,
it has taken us to a new level.

It is out of control, Pete.

I accepted it.
But not anymore. It is finished.

Finished.
As of right now.

I am your wife.
I know.

You remember that.

Scott.
Yeah.

If Power tanks again,
I'm sending him down.

You want me to tell him that?
If you think he'll pitch better, yes.

I wouldn't put money on this guy.

Hey, take that for me, will ya?

Pete Rose's office.

Yeah, let me see if I can find him.

Paul Janszen.

He must have stepped out.
I'll let him know that you called.

Yeah. OK.

He says it's urgent
that you get back to him right away.

Pete.

Are you OK?

Be careful with the friends you pick, Scott.
They can cause you a lot of problems. OK?

Go play baseball.

Go play baseball, come on.

The number you have reached
is no longer in service...

and there is no new number
at this time.

This is a recording.

The number you have reached
is no longer in service...

FBI, Mr. Janszen.
Please open up.

Mr. Janszen,
we're not gonna ask nicely again.

Uh, just a second.

Mr. Paul Janszen?
You're Mr. Janszen, right?

What's this about?

You're under arrest
for the trafficking of illegal substances.

Step back
and put your hands behind your head.

You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say
can be used against you in a court of law.

You have the right to an attorney.

If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

Do you understand your rights
as I have read them to you?

The most important thing
for you to keep in mind is this, Paul -...

be honest, be forthright.

Lying to us is only going to get you
deeper into what is already a bad situation.

Perjury, added to narcotics trafficking,
you don't need.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

I mean, I've used steroids a few times
before, but, you know, who hasn't?

I haven't.
I doubt my partner has.

How 'bout your buddy Pete?

Who?
You know, Pete Rose.

You two are, like, joined at the hip.

I don't know anything about that.
About what?

Whatever it is
you're trying to get me to say.

About anything.
I'm a little confused.

Are you trying to tell us Pete Rose
isn't involved in trafficking drugs with you?

What?
And Don Stenger and Tommy Gioiosa?

Listen carefully, Paul.
You're with us or against us.

No in-between.

There's no more money.
I used what was left for bail.

You're broke, Paul.

How you gonna defend yourself, huh?

How you gonna hire a lawyer?

Pete will come through.
He's the reason you're in this mess.

When are you gonna admit that?

He's not your friend, Paul,
he never was.

He doesn't have friends.
You know, he has people that he uses.

It was more than that.

Then where is he now?

I mean,
why doesn't he return your phone calls?

Why doesn't he pay you back
your money?

I told you a thousand times -...

it's his wife.
It's Carol.

If you want to keep fooling yourself,
then that's your business.

I don't want any part of it.

Katarina.

There you go.
Yeah.

Perfect as always, Cathy.

So, why don't you call me when
you get tired of that husband of yours?

Oh, I've been tired of him for ten years.

That doesn't mean
I need another bastard in my life.

Hi, Pete.

Hey, Paulie.
Where you been hiding yourself?

Can we talk?
Sure. Of course.

But not right now.
I'm kinda in a rush. Got a game tonight.

I'm in a lot of trouble, Pete.
Yeah? What kind of trouble?

I'm talking big trouble,
you know? Federal.

It just happened.
I need a lawyer.

I need money, Pete.
I need the money you owe me.

Let's take this off the street.

Why'd you freeze me out like that?
Was it just the money?

You know me -
I don't give a shit about money.

Maybe a little.

Women, Paulie, they're like elephants.
They never forget.

Carol's had a bug up her ass about you
ever since I almost got caught...

testing the wrong oil.

She knows I fool around - hell, I've been on
the road half my life, what do you expect? -...

but every once in a while,
you know, she's got to put on a big show.

Shove it down my throat. She's Mrs.
Pete Rose, not some floozy I'm banging.

You just got caught in the middle,
that's all.

I wish you would have
just been upfront with me all this time.

I have been.
Carol's my wife.

She's my wife. It's like they say -
a rock and a hard place.

OK, but I just really need the money,
though. Can I have the money?

How much you need?
The full 30K. What you owe.

Whoa.
That's a big number, Paulie.

You figure it different?

I'm just saying it's a whole lot of cash
to come up with, like, out of the blue.

I'm not going to jail, Pete. And I don't want
anybody else to go to jail, either.

OK.

Come on, stop dancing.
Say it.

OK. If I don't have a good lawyer,
I'm screwed.

Now, I don't want to cooperate,
but if I have to, I will.

Don't worry.

Hey, go see Roger, my lawyer,
tomorrow afternoon. I'll set it up.

I'll make sure
he takes care of everything.

I knew I could count on you, Pete.
Come on. Whose better than us, right?

Thanks, buddy.

Pete contacted me about your problem.

He's always been a loyal friend and,
to be quite honest, against my advice...

he's decided to help you out.

Pete has a big heart, on and off the field.
Always has.

I appreciate Pete's friendship,
but, uh,

in all honesty,
this is money he borrowed from me.

Excuse me for being so impertinent,
but why on earth...

would my client need to borrow money
from you or anyone else, for that matter?

I don't think we should get into that.
Please, you've piqued my curiosity.

Your client
has a major gambling problem.

Is that so? And how do you come by
such intimate knowledge?

I'm the guy who placed his bets.

What's this?
Pure generosity.

My client has assured me
he doesn't owe you a penny,

but he's agreed to loan you
ten thousand dollars.

He's gonna loan me
ten thousand dollars?

That sick bastard owes me 30 grand.

30 thousand dollars.
Do you understand me, you little prick?

Your client is a gambling degenerate.

He bets on his own sport,
that's how sick he is.

Please, Mr. Janszen, sit down.

OK.

What happened?
What's wrong? Paul?

That son of a bitch
just made the biggest mistake of his life.

Pete.

Carol.

Pete.

You can't just waltz into people's houses
and take things.

There's a law against that.
It's called 'breaking and entering. '

Like I said before, I used my key.
Pete gave it to me a long time ago.

So what's this?
His betting sheets.

We don't give a damn about gambling.
We told you that. This is about narcotics.

The R stands for 'Reds. '
He bet on his own team?

For years, and big.
'2' is for two grand.

Well, that's a major league
baseball problem, not yours.

Your problems, Paul, are why we're here,
and what you should be worrying about.

So?

So I wanted you to know...

that all that shit about me placing bets
in Pete's name was a lie.

I mean, every bet was his.

My mother didn't raise any morons.

Did he ever make good?
The bat. I got the bat.

The one he broke Cobb's record with.

I hate to tell you,
but there's a lot of them around.

The jerk I sold it to don't know that.
What's the point of this little get-together?

I wanted to know if you'd be interested
in some other business.

Something very profitable.
Get to the point.

I got a source
get me all the steroids I want.

If the price is right,
I could be interested.

I was hoping you'd say that.

You like living, don't you, Paul?

Look into my eyes.

That's right.
There's nobody home.

Yeah, yeah.
OK. Bye.

Yeah, hello.
Mikey. You there?

I ain't on the moon.

I just wanted to warn you.
Get ready to duck.

What the hell are you talking about?

I always liked you, and that's
the only reason that I'm making this call.

Just... Just trust me here.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

Hey, Paulie, I don't like this kinda talk.

Consider yourself lucky we're having it.

Paulie.
Paulie, listen to me...

Wanna get that?

Nope.

Please leave
a message after the beep. Thanks.

What the hell's going on, Paulie?

I just talked to Mike. What's all this'Get
ready to duck'crap you're talking about?

I really hope you're not doing
something you're gonna regret.

Call me back right away.

He sounds panicked.

You OK?

Yeah.

It feels good -...

not fooling myself anymore.

Is your name Paul Janszen?
Yes.

Were you once employed
at the Queen City Barrel Company?

Yes.

Are you still employed there?

No.

Have you ever sold
or knowingly associated...

with people who sold illegal drugs?

Yes.

Did you ever sell drugs to Pete Rose?

No.

Did Pete Rose ever knowingly associate
with people who sold illegal drugs?

Yes.

Was Pete Rose aware
that you yourself had dealt illegal drugs?

Yes.

Did Pete Rose ever bet
on the Cincinnati Reds baseball team?

Yes.

Did you yourself place bets for Pete Rose
on major league baseball games?

Yes.

Major League Baseball.
Mr. Ueberroth's office.

No, I'm sorry.
Mr. Ueberroth is in a meeting right now.

OK. I will.

Thank you. Bye.

How long we supposed to wait, huh?
What's this? An audience with the Pope?

He's the damned baseball commissioner,
not the president.

Pete, listen to me.

The commissioner didn't call you up here
to waste your time. This is serious.

Yeah.
I'm serious, too.

Peter.
Hello, Pete. How are you?

Nice bunch of pictures on the wall outside.
Why aren't I up there?

This is Ed Durso, our chief operating
officer and long time counsel.

You know Fay, of course.
Hi.

And Bart Giamatti,
our commissioner elect.

How are you?
Congratulations. Better you than me.

I got my hands full
just running the team.

Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

Well, I hate to leave my guys, but...

Well, we appreciate it, Pete.
All of us.

This shouldn't take long.
I got a short attention span, I hope not.

All right, Pete. What we need,
the reason we asked you in today...

concerns the allegations
about your gambling.

I'll lay five to one it's all bull.

Well, we heard that Sports Illustrated
is about to run a rather unflattering story.

Which contains nothing
but utter false accusations.

I don't doubt it.
And one of the sources, Paul Janszen,

is rather disreputable,
to put it mildly.

He's a flat-out liar.
I don't doubt that's true.

Well, Pete, how would you describe
your relationship with Mr. Janszen?

Relationship? There was none. He was a...
How would you say? A gofer.

He ran errands.
You know how it is with these guys -...

you're nice to 'em, then they start to
imagine they're your best friend and then...

You know: Don't get too close to the help.
Exactly.

It was my big heart
landed me in the shitter.

So we can take it that the allegations
you bet on baseball are entirely false?

Commissioner, never.

Not once in my life.

I'd have to be insane.

I'd have to be the dumbest son of a bitch
in the whole world to do that.

Well, nothing could be more damaging
to the fabric of our national pastime...

than illicit gambling.

I agree with you 110 per cent, Bart, which
is why I don't bet on baseball, gentlemen,

and I never will.

But you do go to the track quite often,
that's fair to say, isn't it?

When I was about this big, Fay,

my dad used to take me to the track
for the sport of it.

He couldn't afford to bet.

Now I take my son,
and one day my son will take his son.

And that doesn't mean it's bad.

Guys, if it was bad,
I just wouldn't do it.

Well, Pete,
we just thought it best to clear the air.

We'll call you
if we have any other questions.

OK. We all got enough to do without
worrying about what some moron says.

Right, Peter?
Right.

OK. Thank you.
Bart. Fay, Ed.

Oh, don't forget about my picture, OK?
Bye, gentlemen.

So long, Pete.
So, what do you think?

Like he said, he'd have to be insane.
I believe him.

I do, too, actually.
I don't disagree.

But as long as you have these accusations
with such gravity...

Yeah.
That article.

It's gonna create a certain climate.
Right.

Maybe it's time to bring in John Dowd.
Do you think he's the right guy?

Well, he prosecuted the Mob for the
Justice Department. I think it's a good idea.

Mr. Dowd. A pleasure to meet you, sir.
And you.

My associate.

Materials I've gathered
from Janszen on Rose.

Checks signed by Rose.

Hello, Ron.
Thanks for coming in.

Pete, did anyone in association with you
bet on baseball...

or talk about betting on baseball
between 1985 and 1987?

I don't know what you mean,
'talk about betting on baseball, '...

but no one bet baseball around me.

Pete, you previously testified
that you did no gambling business...

with anyone
other than Janszen at the track.

That's correct.
All right.

Pete, the Reds played Atlanta
on April 28, 1987. A 7:35 game.

Phone records show Paul Janszen
called Ron Delaplane that same day...

at 5:59, 6:16 and 6:43,

then called the Reds clubhouse
at 6:45 and again at 6:55.

He called five times?
Hm.

Do you know what that telephone traffic
is all about?

No. No idea.

You're aware that Paul Janszen
has testified that he bet on baseball?

Bet on the Cincinnati Reds for you?

I'm sure he probably did,
from reading the trouble he's in.

You know,
people have a tendency to say things...

when their ass is on the chopping block.

Perhaps we should take a break.

My client's been answering questions
for hours.

I'm OK.
I'm fine.

I just want to get it over with.

Pete, what if I were to tell you that we have
physical evidence that directly links you...

to numerous wagers
placed over a period of months...

on football, basketball,
hockey and baseball games?

I...

I might have...

I might have bet
the occasional football game,

but never in my life
did I bet on baseball.

Never bet on baseball?
Never. Ever.

Not once.

Pete, we have phone records
of Paul Janszen, Mike Bertolini,

calls placed from your home phone,
from the Reds' clubhouse,

betting slips with your handwriting on 'em,
numerous canceled checks.

I'm gonna say this one more time.

I never bet on baseball...

in my whole life.

Not from the clubhouse,
from New York,

from New England,
from New Mexico.

From nowhere.

If I'm guilty of anything
in this whole mess,

it's from being
a horseshit selector of friends.

It's all there.

Is there any doubt in your mind
that Rose bet on baseball?

None whatsoever.

How'd it go?
What are those?

Flowers.
Well, I know that much.

Azaleas.
Beautiful, huh?

Strong and tenacious.

Roger's still in the dark.
You'd think after all these months,

Giamatti'd be just as anxious as me
to bury this whole mess.

I mean, what are they waiting for, Carol,
huh? For me to become an old man?

You are an old man.
Watch out. I'll prove you wrong.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

There's a reason
they call me Charlie Hustle, you know.

I heard a rumor about that once.

When this whole mess is over,

we should take a trip, honey.

Europe, maybe.

How about Japan?
They like baseball in Japan.

Give them a chance
to meet a real baseball hero.

OK, Bart.
I got it. I understand.

We're in sync.
I'll talk to Pete and we'll get back later.

Come on, already.
Come on.

OK. Listen carefully
because this is the best we can do.

According to the agreement,
you will be banned from baseball,

reviewable after one year.
Please, both of you, hear me out.

Yeah, OK. What about
the betting on baseball stuff? I mean...

There'll be no finding.
W-What's that mean?

Giamatti said MLB
won't rule one way or another.

It's a dead issue.
They won't bring it up.

The ban is for gambling on other sports,
not on baseball.

Over and out.
Banned?

Again, it's reviewable after one year.
Then Pete gets another shot.

And the league can never say
you bet on baseball. Never.

Pete, this has been
a complete public-relations nightmare.

You're not happy.
Believe me, Giamatti's not happy, either.

He wanted to make his case.

We've done everything.
Blocked 'em in court, subpoenaed them.

Now this is their final offer.
We've run out of options.

The banishment for life
of Pete Rose from baseball...

is the sad end of a sorry episode.

One of the game's greatest players
has engaged in a variety of acts,

which have stained the game,

and he now must live
with the consequences of those acts.

He's gonna have to
face some consequences, too.

No player or manager,

no matter how exalted,
is above the game.

The integrity of baseball itself
is at stake.

The matter of Mr. Rose is now closed.

Commissioner.

Did Pete Rose
bet on baseball?

In my opinion - yes.

Pete Rose did bet on baseball.

What?
That bastard.

He went against the agreement.

Theirs was no finding. No finding
as to whether he ever bet on baseball.

They screwed us.
You know what, Rog? Screw 'em.

I'll have the last word if it kills me.

I'll have the last word.

Trust me on this.
I'll be out of baseball a very short time.

Pete.
Over here.

Pete, were you surprised
by Commissioner Giamatti's statement?

I was a little surprised by some of
those remarks. Some, I didn't understand.

What are you gonna do
with yourself, Pete?

Nothing.

L'll have to do without baseball for
the first time since I was seven years old.

Pete.

Hey, you know what they can't
take away from me?

From the fans?

The bits and pieces of myself
I left behind in all those ballparks...

for 27 years.
Pete.

They can't... They can't have that.
Pete. Pete, over here.

If the Commissioner... Pete?
Pete. Pete.

Did you ever bet on baseball, Pete?

Well, regardless of what
the Commissioner said today,

I never bet on baseball.
Um...

That's all I can say.
Pete.

Pete, hi.
Just one more question.

Over here.
Over here.

It's OK, Pete.

There's a high drive, way back...

Pete Rose.
He's circling the bases.

Holy cow.

What a thrill to watch him.

The crowd giving him
a standing ovation.

You have always denied,
publicly, that you bet on baseball.

Did you bet on baseball?

Yes, I did. And that was my mistake.

Did you bet on your own team?

Yes.
