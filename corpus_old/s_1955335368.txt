Mm, mm, mm.

[SIGHS]
Ah.

Looks like I got you
all ready for me.

No, no, no, no.

You don't
get to see these

until I get
to see him.

And you know I don't like to
see him if he isn't happy.

You know that.

He'll get happy,
just give him a second.

Why don't you

take him
into the bedroom,

go make him happy,

then I'll join you
in a minute.

Okay.

I'm ready when you are.
I'm ready.

Come on,
I really need to get ready.

Yup, all the bad sex.

what do you think you're doing?
Grandma.

I thought
that we both decided

that you were gonna stop leaving
presents for your mother.

You know, when you
were a little kid

it was cute,

but now,
it's kind of creepy.

I've missed you
so much.

I'm sorry
I have to rush off.

I'm Christmas shopping
with Gia and Sarah tonight.

Don't worry about me,
honey.

I've got a huge
bridge tournament tonight,

and I'm gonna
kick some hairy ass.

This is from
Mrs. Garrett.

There's actually a police officer
outside her house right now.

She wants to know

if I will help decorate
her home for Christmas.

Who does shit
like that?

She's offering to pay.
Fuck her.

Watch the mouth.
It's Christmas.

And you don't even feel
a little sorry for her?

I mean,
especially after

what happened
to her daughter?

It's none
of our effin' business.

You're right.

We are gonna have
stress-free holiday.

[CRICKETS CHIRPING]

[WOMAN STRAINING]


Whoa, oh, oh, oh...
I got it.

Uh. Oh...
I got it.

I thought Santa and me
were goners for a second.

Oh, here, let's just
lay him down here.


Rachel Kimmel.

I am so glad
you dropped by.

I simply couldn't have decorated
this house by myself.

Oh, the letter.

Um, actually, I--

do you remember Jaime
when you were a little girl?

I remember
she couldn't come outside.

I think she had some
kind of skin disease.

Bowen's disease.

You know,
my life was not the same

when Jaime
was taken from me.

A pity.

She could've been
like you.

I try not to let
my mind wonder like that.

You know,
I didn't know

your mother very well.

But what
I do remember,

she was beautiful.

You think
I look like my mother?

Would you like to come in
and get something to drink?

Um, I actually
have to go shopping,

but, uh,

it should only take
a couple of hours.

Would you like me
to come back?

You'd really come back?

Thank you.

I'll see you later.

[DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE]

Sugarballs, get back here.



[GROWLING CONTINUES]

[PUNCHING]
[WHIMPERING]

Sugarballs.

Sugarballs.

Sugarballs.



[MAN'S VOICE] You're just
a worthless little girl.

Get over here!

Hi.

[STRAINING,
STRUGGLING]

[VOICE #1] I've got a present for you.
[VOICE #2] It's playtime.

[WOMAN'S VOICE] Stop
telling me what to do.

I'm not
some punching bag

that you can take your aggression
out on whenever you want.


Men.
You're all alike.

And don't think
I'd forgotten what you...

[VOICES WHISPERING]

What you did to me.

I was just a child.

And you...

Passed me around

to all those...

[VOICES WHISPERING]

Men.

Like I wasn't even...

Human.


Yahh!


Don't you worry,
darling.

Oh!


This boring town
is awful without you.

I can't believe
I actually miss it.

Well then,
let's not waste any time.

Oh, oh...
Photo op!

[SHOPPERS CHATTERING]

Hey.

Hi.
[SQUEALS]

Muah.
Muah.

Have I got a
surprise for you.

You're scaring me.

Come on,
let's go.

You'll love it.
I promise you.

Keep your eyes closed.

Now open.

Surprise.

Don't blame Sarah,
okay?

I put her up to this

because you wouldn't
take my phone calls.

What?

Merry Christmas.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING,
SCREAMING, GIGGLING]


Close your eyes
and open your mouth.

I got a big package
ready for delivery.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

Are you feeling
adventurous?

I thought having sex
while your parents were gone

was adventurous.

[BELLS JINGLING]

What's that?

Adventure.


No.

What are you doing?

Oh, you aren't scared,
are you?

What if
there's an emergency?

Then we create
a safe word.

And then if things
get too wild for you

just say the safe word
and I'll stop.

All right,
what about...

"Jingle balls"?
[LAUGHING]

Uh.

You are so
helplessly cute.

I'll be right back
with a big surprise.


Hurry up.

Fucking bitch.

Ah, fuck.

What the fuck, man.


[MUSIC BOX PLAYING]

What the...?

Why don't I wear
the costume?

You know, you're always
on top, right?

[FLOORBOARD CREAKING]

What's behind your back?

Is it gonna
make me scream?

[LABORED BREATHING]

Jingle balls.
Jingle balls!

Jingle balls!
Jingle balls!

Jingle balls!
Jingle balls!

[SNIPS]
[SCREAMING]




[GIRLS LAUGHING]

Yeah,
check 'em out.


What the hell happened?

You just left me.

Just stop
blaming your mom

for everything
that's wrong in your life.

I'm not gonna leave you
like she did.

I wish
I wasn't so scared.

[MRS. GARRETT] Come to
the table, darling.

Dinner is ready.

You are such a lovely,

lovely girl.

And your mother
loves you

so very, very much.

She loves you

because you are perfect.

Absolutely...

Perfect.

You really
should eat, dear.



What did you say to me?

Just once I would like
to have a nice dinner

without you
picking a fight with me.

You always
find some way

to ruin my appetite.

Maybe next time
you can make the dinner

and I'll berate
your cooking skills.

Would you like that?

And you haven't even

said anything
about how I look tonight.

Men.

You're all alike.

You are going
to pay for that.

I thought
I was doing you a favor.

Oh, you wanna
do me a favor.


Fine.

I got a job
for you tonight.

A job?
You mean like work?

I don't work.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

[ENGINE STARTS]

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hi, Mrs. Garrett.

Gia Wilson,

and Sarah Hayes.

I remember you both.

Please.

Wow.

Are you
going somewhere?

Oh.

You ran off so fast,
I forgot to tell you.

I have a date tonight.

It's not a big deal.

I should only be gone
a couple hours.

[LAUGHS] -That's
pretty fast for a woman

who hasn't left a house
in over 15 years.

I didn't say
it was a romantic date.

Heavens, no.

I gave up dating
those monsters years ago.

No, I am celibate
and content

on remaining so.


[NERVOUS LAUGHTER]

I mostly need
some extra boxes

brought down
from the attic.

And I have more lights
I would like up outside,

and I haven't done
any decorating

in the bathrooms.

There's plenty of food
in the fridge.

And I would be insulted

if you did not have

a glass
of my holiday eggnog

before you left.

No one makes it
quite like me.

Oh, and before I leave,

I need to show you
the door to the attic

where I keep
the extra decorations.

Here are the stairs
to the attic.

Is that Jaime's room?

May I?

Didn't I give this to Jamie
for Christmas one year?

She loved this doll.

Um, I always
wanted to know

why you never let Jaime
play with us outside.

She always
looked so sad

watching us
from her window.

Jaime was very fragile.

[MRS. GARRETT] I just
wanted to protect her.

She needed protecting.

They don't want to play
with you, baby.

They are selfish
and spoiled rotten.

They don't have
a good mama like you.

Now, come away
from the window, baby.

Stop torturing yourself.

Those children,
they won't understand you.

They will
make fun of you.

They will laugh at you
because you are different.

Do you hear me?

Did you hear me?

What are you looking at?

You see, baby?

They don't want
to play with you.

They ain't nothin' but a bunch
of naughty little children.

I always
tried to have

a very positive attitude
around Jaime.

I believe positive reinforcement
is very important

for a child's
mental health.

Thank you for opening
up to me about Jaime.

It's nice to finally
understand why you and Jaime

were so isolated
from everyone.

I hope you don't
mind my asking...

But what happened
to Jaime?

There are so many
awful rumors.

How did she go missing?

[INHALES DEEPLY]

That is a conversation
for another day, sweetie.

I don't think
either of us

needs to be dredging up
our painful pasts.

Now, don't you girls
do anything too dangerous.

Safety first.


I just can't
believe this.

I remember seeing the three
of you playing in the street.

And now look at you.

Thank you
for your help.

What-- come here.
Come look at this.

Why would she screw
the windows shut?

Well, I'm sure

it's just for
added security.

I mean,
she lives alone.

That's debatable.

I have to admit

these mannequins
are kinda creeping me out.

I say
we blow this joint.

Oh, come on,
I cannot bail on her now.

It's not just
the mannequins,

they're strange,
Rachel. Come here.

I wanna show you
something else.

All of these presents
are addressed to Jaime.

Can you believe it?

No one in their right mind
would do something like this.

I don't know.

Maybe it makes her
feel better.

Or maybe she's just
cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

[LAUGHING] -Is it wrong for
her to hold onto the hope

that Jaime might
come back some day?

Come back?

I thought
she was killed.

Well, there have been
all kinds of crazy rumors.

Who knows
what really happened.

I know what happened.

I was in kindergarten
and Jonathan Curtis

who used to live down
this very street,

said she was snatched
right out of her bed

in the middle
of the night.

And that's not all.

He said he knows
where she was taken.

That she was taken
by some

hideously deformed
creature named Krampus.

What the hell is that?

Don't listen to her.

Krampus is just
an urban legend.

That's what you think.

Krampus is basically
like Santa Claus,

but just
the exact opposite.

He kidnaps and tortures
little children

who misbehave
during Christmas season.

As if Santa
wasn't creepy enough.

Hey, I was only five fucking years
old when he told me that story.

He scared
the shit out of me.

I had nightmares
for days ever since.

Jonathan and Curtis
destroyed my childhood.

Strange how you lost your
virginity to him in high school.

I know, right?

[SHOWER RUNNING]

Honey?

Thanks for leaving
the window open, sweetie.

It's not cold
or anything.

Babe.

Are you gonna be feeling
frisky when you get out?

Because once I start
reading...

Fine by me.



Ahh!

Ugh!


Oh, no, god!

No, no!

No, please!

[WHIMPERS, SHOUTS]



a strange collection before?

Collections are just a waste
of time and money.

Only boring people
who have nothing better to do

collect things.
Really?

What about your collection
of beanie babies and STDS?


If I'm gonna
survive this night,

I'm gonna need
something better to sip on

than old lady
watered-down eggnog.

You could run down
to the shop 'n' stop.

You have about ten minutes
until 12 o'clock.

Okay.

I have to try
this dress on.

It's beautiful.

I don't think
that's a good idea.

I think
it's a great idea.

This is going on
Facebook.

I thought
you were in a hurry.

It'll take one second,
I swear.

Make it fast.

I'm gonna go get
the other boxes from the attic.


Gia.
Ah!

Look at this.

So what?
Mrs. Garrett was a nurse.

Big deal.

How do I look?

Uh, could you
forget that for one second?

I'm serious.
Look at it.

Read the name
of the person

standing next
to Mrs. Garrett.

Laura Kimmel.

My mother.

Are you
fucking with me?

Mrs. Garrett
lied to me.

She told me that she
hardly knew my mother.

Why do you think
she would say that?

I don't know.

What would
she be hiding?

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

[ABBY] Hello?
[RACHEL] Grandma?

I need to ask you
something,

and please
be honest with me.

Well, of course,
honey.

Did you know
that my mother

and Mrs. Garrett
worked together?

Were they friends?

Why are you
asking me that?

Just tell me.

Rachel,

conversation later.

Where are you?

Please--
[PHONE BEEPS]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Rah!
Ah!

Come here.

Whoa.

When you said Mrs. Garrett was
lonely, you weren't kidding.

Oh, what's her deal?

Well, she's certainly
not a people person.

make her feel safe.

Is that her?

Oh, god,
it is.

Cover him back up.

This is getting
more twisted by the second.

I...

Look at that.

What the fuck's

Oh!

Forget about that.

The question is,
what's in there?

We need to find

Please pick up.

I'm sorry
I hung up on you.

I really need

I am at

strange is going on.

[CAT MEOWS]

[SCREECHING, CRUNCHING]

I'm gonna

Let me change.
No.

[STABBING]
[SOBBING]

[TELEPHONE RINGING]


Hello?

Hey, Rachel,
I'm glad you answered.

Cody, I don't have time
to talk right now.

I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

I see.
It's nothing like that.

Are you okay?

Nothing is okay.

I can't trust anyone.

You can trust me.

I found
these letters--

romantic letters that
were written to my mother

a long time ago.

Apparently, my mom
was having an affair

with a married man.

So, you think
she ran off with him.

I didn't get that
from the letters.

Who was you mom
having an affair with?

My mom
was having an affair

with Mrs. Garrett's
husband.

[DOG BARKING]

Sarah?

[CLOCK TICKING]

Thanks for all the cheap
chilled wine, Sarah.

Fine.
I'll drink it by myself.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Why are the lights out?

Gia?

Sarah?

Come on,
you guys.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

I don't know
what's going on here.

I can't find
Gia and Sarah anywhere.

Hold on.
Slow down.

Okay, I need
to tell you something.

I just found
Gia's cell phone upstairs.

She never goes
anywhere without it.

And not only that,

but the key is here.

I'm sure it's the key
that we were looking for.

Listen to me.

I looked up Mitchell
Garrett on the Internet.

What?

You know,
Mr. Garrett?

The man your mother
was boning?

What-- what did you
find out?

There isn't a lot of
information except that...

He didn't
just leave Mrs. Garrett.

It says
in the early '90s,

he was sent
to ironwoods state prison.

That's not
very far from us.

Is he still there?

There's not much about him,
but from the looks of it,

he's been there
for about 15 years.

15 years?

time that Jamie went missing.

There was a police car
outside Mrs. Garrett's house

earlier this evening.

Rachel, you gotta
get out of that house.

[CODY'S VOICE BREAKING UP]

You're breaking up.
Do you hear me?

Rachel,
are you there?

Cody!

[DOOR CREAKING]


Ahh!

I'm not going
to hurt you.

[BREAKERS CLICKING]

Who, who turned on
the lights?

Jaime has finally
come home

for the holidays.

That's impossible.

Who's upstairs?


I told you.
Jaime.

Are you okay, dear?
You look sick.

No!

You don't even know
what happened to Jaime.

Jaime was five years old

when my husband
found out

the truth about her.

He was so disgusted

what he found out
what Jaime was

that he tried
to kill her.

But I called the police

just in time.

You see,
Jaime was born...

[INHALES, EXHALES]

A boy.

I was expecting
a lovely little girl.

So, you can imagine
my surprise

when I gave birth
to a beautiful...

Manipulating,
perverted...

Womanizing man!

When I came home
from the hospital,

I brought
Jaime down here.

And...

Fixed the little problem.

It was easy
as removing a nasty wart.

When my husband
was arrested,

I was able
to convince everyone

that he was responsible
for the mutilation.

But poor Jamie
was still taken from me

and put in
a mental hospital.

And that's where
she's been

her whole life...

Until now.

She's come home.

And she wants me
to fix her.


Oh, my god.

Ah.

[INHALES, EXHALES]

You had
some of my special

holiday eggnog.

I told you
no one makes it

â™ª quite like me. â™ª

Oh...


Ha.

Oh, mommy...


I missed you so much.

Mom.

I right here, baby.

[INHALES, EXHALES]

No, no, no, no, no!

Ooh!
You're not my mom!

Leave me alone!


Oh, my god!


Mm.
Wha-- wha...

What did you do
to my mother?

Where is my mother?

You poor, poor dear.

Your mother
was a filthy whore.

She tried to take
my husband...

And so I buried the bitch
out back in my garden.



[LABORED BREATHING]


[CRIES OUT]

[MUFFLED SCREAMS]

[MUFFLED SCREAMS]


Rachel.

Come on. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

Don't worry. I knocked

Cody, hurry.
He's coming.

Cody, hurry!

No, no, no.

[BONES SNAP]
Ah! Ahh! Ah!

Cody?

Cody, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

Now.
I can't run.

I can't run.
It's my leg.

Look,
let me help you.


Ah.
[LABORED BREATHING]

Cody, I'm gonna
hide you in here.

You do not
make a sound.

[GROANING]
Shh! Shh!

Don't worry.

I won't leave you this time.
I promise.

Okay.


[DOOR CLOSES]






Ugh!



[MUFFLED SCREAMS]

[ MUFFLED SCREAMING]
Yah!

Ooh!


Yahhh!


Now, you've gone

and pissed me off.

This...

This is for my mother!


Don't!
Take that bitch

to the timeout room!

No! No!

No, no, not the--

take her up there.

No, get off me!

No!

No! No!
No, no, no!

No, no, please!

No! Please, please! No!

Ugh!

Don't, don't!

Rachel!
Oh, my god, Cody!

What are you
gonna do to him?

Let him go!


No!


Jaime, may I see
what you've brought me?

What the fuck
are you gonna do to me?

Oh, my. You've been
busy, haven't you?

I see you have a variety
of shapes and sizes.

It's always good
to have options.

Oh, have, uh...

Have you decided
which one

you would like to use?


Ugh!

[MANIACAL CHUCKLE]

What are you people
gonna do with me?

Let him go!

Jaime, will you go get
my surgical bag?

It's still in
my closet.


Um.

Don't worry.

I know Jamie's
crazy as a hoot.

And I know
there is no possible way

I could fix
Jamie's problem.


Or is there?

I'm going to do
what my husband

tried to do years ago.

I'm going
to put Jamie...

Out of her misery.

How are you
gonna get away with this?

My crazy child

escapes from a
mental institution

and comes home
to kill me...

Only I kill her first.


I'll be a hero.


And you and I will live
happily ever after.

You...

You were supposed
to be mine.

That bastard husband
of mine

got your mother pregnant

at the same time
he knocked me up.

And wouldn't
you know it...

He gave that bitch
a baby girl.

That's right.

You and Jaime...

Are family.

Come here.

Come here.

Now, Jaime...

I need to talk to you
in private

in the living room.

Come on. Come on, now. Let's go.

Oh, oh, my.
I almost forgot.

Ahhh!
[SCREAMING]

No!



I'm sorry, baby.

You no longer
belong in this world.

I only did what I did

to protect you.

I thought
I could save you...

Make you better.

Oh, Jaime.

Why didn't you
come back to me

like the little girl
I knew?

I finally see you.

And you ain't nothin'
but a dickless man.

And there ain't nothin'
worse than that.

Ugh!
[MOANING]

I love you baby.
I love you, baby, so much.

Ugh!

Ahh!


Stop it!



[VOICES WHISPERING]

[WOMAN'S VOICE]
Just before you die.

Let's go bury this
bitch out back.
