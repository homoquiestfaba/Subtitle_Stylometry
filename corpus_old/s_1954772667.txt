<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>Excuse me! Excuse me!</i>

<i>Excuse me! I gotta get downstairs!</i>
<i>I gotta be changing!</i>

<i>Come on back here and put

<i>I gotta change first.</i>

<i>Tape. Let's roll tape...</i>

Man

Oh, yeah.

Ah, yeah.

Yeah.
You like that?

Ooh.
Yeah.

Oh, that's nice.

Just let me

No, I think it's just fine where it is.

Oh, come on, baby.
Just a little bit.

No, pap--

Man

Don't mean I don't wanna
mess around a little bit.

I just didn't wanna do all of that.

Come on, now.

It's just getting
good to me.

What the hell

Clarence?
I told you be here 9, 9:30.

What time is it?
11:00, hell!

Come on,

Wait, wait, wait.

Just...

Â¶ Woke up this morning Â¶

Â¶ When chickens was crowing
for days... Â¶

<i>Get her off the stage!</i>

<i>Good Lord!</i>
<i>Just let her sing anyway.</i>

Â¶ Looked on the right side of my pillow... Â¶
<i>Get off the stage!</i>

Â¶ My man had gone away... Â¶

<i>I don't wanna hear this, man.</i>
<i>Go back inside.</i>

<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>Just let the girl sing!</i>

Â¶ By his pillow Â¶

Â¶ He left a note Â¶

Â¶ Reading,
"I'm sorry, Jane Â¶

Â¶ You got my goat Â¶

Â¶ No time to marry Â¶

Â¶ No time to settle down"... Â¶

Get what everybody else gets.
Well, we ain't everybody else.

No, no, no.
You said $5, sir.

A little something extra
for me and my sister.

A dollar's good enough and a dollar's what you'll take.

$2, sir,
for the both of us?

For a week's work?
That's the deal.

<i>Can you see her this time?</i>

Hmm?

You had a good week,
at least.

I know washwomen
who make more.

Don't be that way.

Well, I'm tellin' ya,
Mama ain't satisfied.

I'm gonna quit the 81.

You not.

Not if it means
quitting you.

Woman

I told you about having
all those men in the room.

Ain't no mens here,
Miss Taylor!

Just us ladies, ma'am.

<i>Go on and take her her board.</i>
<i>She'll cool down.</i>

Miss Taylor?

Y'all are gonna have to take
that foolishness somewhere--

Okay.
<i>This is not</i>

<i>the only boardinghouse</i>
<i>in Atlanta.</i>

<i>Bessie!</i>

Hey, look here, I'm coming
to work with you today.

I gotta get me
a new act.

I like it.
I like you.

I like you, too.

<i>Bessie!</i>

<i>Good, Georgette.</i>

<i>Mary Watson, if I have</i>
<i>to tell you to smile</i>

one more time,
we having words.

Francine, baby,
you're clomping around up there like a horse.

A H-O-R-S-E.

<i>Bessie, get down now.</i>
<i>Stop teasing.</i>

<i>It's not your rehearsal.</i>
Hey, Mr. Scandrick.

I've been working on
a little something.

<i>Are you saying you wanna</i>
<i>be in my chorus line?</i>

Yeah, come on, girls.
Let's show him.

And a...

Â¶ Oh, I've got
what it takes Â¶

Â¶ But it breaks my heart
to give it away Â¶

Â¶ It's in demand Â¶

Â¶ They want it every day Â¶

Â¶ I've been saving it up-- Â¶

You just keep
right on saving it.

You don't like it?

It's all right, but it ain't
hitting on all the sixes.

Now, if you done
messing up my rehearsal--

What about the bag test,
James, hmm?

Yeah, give her
the test.

You must be
lighter than.

<i>Whoo!</i>

The top prize for tonight's raffle-- a gold tooth.

That's right.

Hold up them tickets.
Hold 'em up.

<i>I know you got 'em.</i>
<i>I know you got 'em.</i>

But first,
the Queen of Melody,

the Empress of Rhythm.

We're talking about
the real Mother of the Blues,

Ma Rainey.

<i>This the real blues here.</i>

<i>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</i>

Â¶ Ooh. Â¶

Â¶ Ooh. Â¶

Â¶ Lord, you see me
weepin' Â¶

Â¶ And you hear me cry Â¶

<i>Sing it, girl.</i>

Â¶ Lord, you see me
weepin' Â¶

<i>Â¶ And you hear me cry Â¶</i>

Â¶ I ain't weepin'
'bout no money Â¶

Â¶ Just that man of mine Â¶

<i>Â¶ Lord, you see me</i>
<i>weepin' Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ And you hear me cry... Â¶</i>

We got rehearsals
in the morning.

I could be sleeping or at least partying.
Well, go on, then.

I just wanna meet her.
You can meet her tomorrow.

<i>Mobile, Alabama,</i>
<i>we're on the road for a week,</i>

<i>then Gainesville, Florida.</i>

Oh, slow, slow, slow, baby. Have mercy.

Contract's only four nights,
then we can go on to--

Why we backtracking to Mississippi
instead of going to 'Bama?

Seem like we should
just go on from here,

maybe do a longer run in Mobile,
even add Huntsville.

Well, we'll be making it just in time for cotton season

and catch everybody
with their pay, you know?

Oh, sh--

Hey, get back here.

<i>Besides,
the harvest don't start in Florida</i>

<i>for another two weeks.</i>
Mm-hmm.

You've been using that goober oil like I told you?

Yes, ma'am.

Nice and soft.

<i>Well, what about Tennessee?</i>

You got Memphis,
you got Chattanoog-- oh!

How'd you get in here?

Can I join your show?
You can see yourself out.

Where you from?

Blue Goose Hollow.
A who what?

That a street name?

<i>Where I'm from,
they don't have no street names.</i>

That where your people from, too?

They died a long time ago.

Well, the loneliest thing
in the world

is a motherless child.

Well, I got two brothers
and my sister Viola--

Well let me shave you dry.

They don't amount
to much, do they?

You on your own.

Well, Miss Blue Goose...
<i>Bessie!</i>

I thank you for calling.
Bessie! Bessie, get down from there.

Do I audition or--
<i>I heard you in the show. I know you can sing.</i>

So stay or jump, bitch.

Well, the train is--
I don't give a damn about the train,

a thunderstorm,
a shotgun or what.

You just got to decide
for yourself.

Hell, you got
the St. Louis blues,

the Chicago blues,
the Gin House blues,

the "my man
done left me" blues.

They all the same song,
ain't they?

With the same three chords.

And you done heard 'em about a dozen
hundred times from a dozen hundred people.

So what make folks
wanna hear from you?

<i>So you got to put</i>
<i>something else in it.</i>

The blues is not about
people knowing you.

It's about
you knowing people.

Who done that
to you, huh?

Big old girl like you
letting folks beat on you.

This look like
it might stay forever.

What you doing fanning yourself around here for?

Shut the door good
on your way out.

Where you going without my sugar, though?

Mm.
Mm-hmm.

What you grinning about,
Blue Goose?

What you know about it?

Same thing you know.

What's your name,
pretty lady?

Bessie Smith.

Miss Bessie Smith.

So, like we said--
How many seats in the house?

200.
I counted 250.

Ah, I meant 200 plus,
give or take.

And you sure
eager to take.

She need to be here?
She needs to understand

why TOBA stands
for "Tough On Black Asses."

Actually, it stands for Theater
Owners Booking Association, T-O-B--

What's the cover?
<i>A nickel.</i>

Hmm, newspaper ad
say a dime.

Well, we don't always--
$12.50.

Pardon me?
That's 10 cents times 250 seats.

Our contract
is 50-50 per head.

$12.50 in advance
every night.

We have no way of knowing

how many people
are actually gonna show up.

We'll refund
your no-shows.

Bessie will be counting
the empty seats.

$12.50.

Boy, aren't you getting
a hell of a deal?

Now let's talk about
the bar.

What you standing
way back here for?

Keep on going.

I ain't said stop.

A little bit more.

Ma.
<i>That's about right.</i>

Now how that feel?

Like I'm about to fall.

That's how it should feel every night.

If you're not
risking nothing,

neither will they.

Now where's that heifer
that stole your man?

Ain't nobody here.
Pick somebody.

Right there.
How about her?

Three rows back
on the left.

Mm-mmm.
Yeah.

Yeah, that look
like her.

And what you gotta
say to that bitch?

<i>And right there.</i>

Oh, there's that pinched-back
man that stole all your money.

Yeah, that's him.

Tell them about theyselves.
Go on, baby.

Bess? We're rehitching.
Okay.

That mighty caboose
right there.

<i>That was Bertha-- I mean, Miss Bessie Smith.</i>

<i>Aw, come on now, be nice, be nice.</i>

<i>We got your headliner</i>
<i>coming up.</i>

Gin.

I got that, Clive.

Gin'll make you crazy.

Why don't you let me buy you a whiskey instead?

That "stand and shout" shit
might work back home,

but you got to bring some hoop-de-doo
to get these silly folk attention.

Don't nobody care
what you think.

You don't know nothin'
from nothin'.

Oh, I ain't trying to fuss with you, gorgeous.

Just 'cause you got
a little sport in your strut

don't make you
no authority.

I was just giving you
my opinion, that's all.

I'm gonna see you
later tonight.

Not hardly.
Yeah, you will.

Hey.

Say, you seen Ma?

You were just talking to her.

Â¶ I went out last night Â¶

Â¶ With a crowd
of my friends Â¶

Â¶ Must have been women,
'cause I don't like no men Â¶

Â¶ Wear my clothes
just like a fan Â¶

Â¶ Talk to the gals
just like any old man Â¶

Â¶ They say I do it Â¶

Â¶ Ain't nobody caught me Â¶

Â¶ Sure got to
prove it on me... Â¶

Oh, wait a minute now,
wait a minute now.

I see some of your eyes rolling,
trying to find my Johnson.

That ain't ladylike.

Trust me, mama,
I got everything you need.

Ha!

Â¶ 'Cause they say I do it Â¶

Â¶ Ain't nobody caught me Â¶

Â¶ Sure got to
prove it on me Â¶

Â¶ Sure got
to prove it on me. Â¶

I almost got her
to go to bed with me.

<i>You ain't almost nothing.</i>

What?

Oh, ain't no "almost"
right here, baby.

Ooh-hoo!

Ma get more tail
than me.

What you looking
'round for?

Who gonna see ya?

<i>And so what if they do?</i>

They got to prove it
on you, baby.

They got to prove it
on you, baby.

Shit, like they doing something bad.

What they doing, baby?

Go on with that.

Let the cards
do the talking.

Let the cards do
the motherfucking talking.

What the fuck
was she talking about?

Take that bullshit on back
where you got it from.

I told you,
you ain't ready for the big leagues.

Oh!

<i>Â¶ Lord, you see me</i>
<i>weepin' Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ And you hear me cry Â¶</i>

Â¶ Lord, you see me
weepin' Â¶

Â¶ And you hear me cry Â¶

Â¶ I ain't weepin'
'bout no money Â¶

Â¶ Just that man
of mine Â¶

Â¶ Lord, this mean
old engineer Â¶

Â¶ Cruel as he could be Â¶

Â¶ This mean old engineer Â¶

Â¶ Cruel as he could be Â¶

Â¶ Took my man away Â¶

Â¶ And blowed the smoke
back at me Â¶

Â¶ Back at me Â¶

Â¶ I'm going down South Â¶

Â¶ Won't be back till fall Â¶

Â¶ Back till fall Â¶

Â¶ I'm going down South... Â¶

Yeah!

Â¶ Won't be back
till fall Â¶

Â¶ If I don't find
my easy rider Â¶

Â¶ Ain't comin' back
at all Â¶

<i>Bessie!</i>

Â¶ Yeah, if I don't find
my easy rider... Â¶

Come on, Bessie!
Â¶ Ain't comin' back at all Â¶

Â¶ Back at all. Â¶

Yeah, Bessie!

<i>Yeah!</i>

You can't control that.

Her goddamn ego--
Whoo-hoo hoo!

I ain't never
seen 'em like that!

We sung that song.

Yeah, I earned
this tonight.

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>Come on, Ma,</i>
<i>you ain't gonna drink no co--</i>

I know you ain't drinking
no corn with me.

Remember what I told you
about the blues?

About you knowing the people
and not the other way around?

Yeah.

I knowed everybody in there
and they knowed me.

You sure love yourself.

<i>I see that gin done finally made you blow your top, huh?</i>

I did good.

It's not a matter
of you doing good.

You're just busted 'cause they was yelling for me

more than they was
yelling for you.

You better turn
your damper down.

I ain't scared of you.
I ain't never asked you to be.

All I asked you for
was respect.

Respect for yourself,
respect for these songs.

I ain't see you respect all this
extra money I'm bringing in here.

Oh, let me get you told,
little gal,

'cause I can see you ain't
learnt your lesson yet.

It's my name
on this train,

it's my name
on those flyers,

and it is in my name
that everybody in this company

takes to that stage.

Now, until you can
get yourself together,

you're going back to deucing,
'cause you ain't ready to headline.

Deucing?
<i>Deucing.</i>

No.

I ain't playing second
to nobody anymore.

Best we shake hands
and go.

<i>Well, Miss Blue Goose...</i>

take off
my goddamn shoes.

What's wrong?
What happened?

We're starting our own show.
Our own show?

We're just getting started.
I'm finished with starting.

Wait, Bessie,
I'm gonna go talk to Ma.

Hey, don't leave.
I'm coming!

The 3:00 with service...
They're coming, all right?

All right,
don't give me that face now.

Just relax.
They're coming.

Ha ha!
Hey, man!

How you feeling?
You all right?

Bobby, you know
I'd catch you.

Good to see you.

So good to see you.

<i>It's corn bread time.</i>

The money gonna come in soon.
Thank y'all for heaven.

<i>Sure.
This ain't nothing like it used to be.</i>

You want some more
of these greens?

<i>You know,</i>
<i>I ain't nervous yet.</i>

You have to take
the show on the road.

Hip, too.
Get a piano on the ground floor.

We're gonna take
good care of you.

'Cause what we're doing
here, man, is

we're bringing a little South to the North.

A little taste of home for all these homesick Yankees.

You know what I'm saying?
They ain't ready for it.

They ain't ready for it,
but I'm telling you,

Bessie's doing
big things, man, and...

<i>you on bass,</i>
<i>you on horn.</i>

Next, we have Doreen Dupree
from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

Is that a real name
or a made-up one?

Hattiesburg is a real--
Not Hattiesburg.

I know where in the hell Hattiesburg is.

I'm talking about
"Doreen Dupree."

That sound like some made-up,
store-bought shit to me.

Don't that sound like some old vaudeville mess to you?

Who mama and daddy gonna name
'em something go together like that?

You pick that out of a magazine or something?

It's on
my birth certificate.

They have birth certificates
in Hattiesburg, Mississippi?

And take that damn gum
out your mouth.

Don't nobody wanna see you
up there chewing like a cow.

Where do I put it?
Hold it in your damn hand, Hattiesburg.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

What is that?

Um, I'm dancing, ma'am.

<i>I wanna--</i>
You better sing something first.

<i>I don't know how to sing.</i>

You don't know
how to sing?

You wanna be in my show,
you have to be able to sing,

dance, and tell
a damn joke or two.

Â¶ Well, I woke up
this morning-- Â¶

That's enough.
Clarence, give her the bag test.

What you grinning for?

You failed.

You must be darker than the bag to be in my show.

Now get going with
your high-heeled ass.

Next!
<i>Etta Johnson, Bell Buckle, Tennessee.</i>

Bell Buckle?
Lord!

No yellow bitches.

Next!

Next!
What if I didn't pass your bag test?

I never give you no test.
Oh, you test me... daily.

No, you--
you tell me.

Come on, Lucy.

No.

I wanna know.

Would you still
love me?

You'd still be you.

And how would you
know that?

You know how I feel.

Then I need you
to say it.

You know.
No, I don't know.

You know.

Then say it.

It wouldn't matter.

It wouldn't matter,
what?

It wouldn't matter
about your color.

And?

And?

You know what?

I cares for you.

You cares for me?

You cares for me.
Is that all?

No, that ain't all.

What-- why you
acting up today?

I need you
to tell me something.

I'm gonna show you something instead.

<i>You can make this bigger.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

<i>It's got to say,</i>
<i>"This is Bessie Smith,"</i>

<i>so make this bigger and this a little bit smaller like that.</i>

Now, that's what-- that's what I'm talkin' about,
right there.

Come on. All right.

<i>Open your eyes!</i>

Hey now!
<i>That's right.</i>

<i>Bessie Smith</i>
<i>and Her Down Home Trio.</i>

Ho-ho, now!
That's right.

Â¶ I was with you, baby... Â¶

Â¶ When you didn't
have a dime Â¶

Â¶ I was with you,
baby Â¶

Â¶ When you didn't
have a dime Â¶

<i>Â¶ Now, since you got</i>
<i>plenty of money Â¶</i>

Â¶ You have throwed
your good gal down... Â¶

<i>This is A.R.</i>
<i>Knight from the "Chicago Defender,"</i>

<i>and I'm here to tell you</i>
<i>that Bessie Smith</i>

<i>is the locomotive</i>
<i>that shot out of Tennessee.</i>

<i>This is W. Alexander</i>
<i>from the "Boston Guardian."</i>

<i>Talk about</i>
<i>"Chattanooga Choo-Choo,"</i>

<i>Bessie Smith is the biggest thing since Ma Rainey.</i>

<i>This is J. Anderson reporting for</i>
<i>the "New York Amsterdam News."</i>

<i>If you haven't got your tickets, folks,</i>
<i>you're not gonna get 'em,</i>

<i>'cause it's already</i>
<i>sold out.</i>

Who is it?

<i>I'm here to audition for Miss Bessie Smith.</i>

I didn't ask you what you want,
I asked you who you are.

<i>Open the door and see me,
big man.</i>

My name is Jack Gee, ma'am,
and I'm 32 years old

from Titustown, Virginia,
and I schooled till the 10th grade.

I'm nobody's husband
and I'm nobody's daddy.

I make $13.75 a week working as a
security guard at the five and dime.

Another $2.80 on the weekend at the Top Hat.

<i>I got my own</i>
<i>two-bedroom apartment</i>

<i>and I drive a brand-new</i>
<i>1921 Davis Touring.</i>

Now, I don't believe in church,
but I do believe in God,

and I know it to be
the God's honest truth

that you're
the most beautiful woman

ever sing the blues,
or any woman, period.

And I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance this fine afternoon.

Can you sing?
Oh, yes.

Can you dance?
Oh, yes.

Auditions for the show
are over.

I ain't auditioning
for no show.

I'm auditioning
to be your man.

You look a little small.

Baby, I'm built for speed.
Really, now?

Well, maybe you only
auditions women.

I auditions
whosoever I please.

I can give it
as hard as I can take it,

and I don't mind
going to jail.

<i>Mm-mm-mm.</i>
<i>Â¶ Whoa, gone away, baby Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Won't be back</i>
<i>till fall Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Lord, Lord, Lord Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Gone away, baby,</i>
<i>won't be back... Â¶</i>

Bottle of gin for the lady
and a glass for me.

<i>Â¶ If I find me</i>
<i>a good man Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I won't be</i>
<i>back at all... Â¶</i>

Oh, she fine. Man.

<i>Watch this.</i>

The lady don't smoke.
The hell she don't.

So that's your man
or what?

No, he's still auditioning.

Can I have
this dance, baby?

Touch her hand, Charlie,
and draw back a nub.

And what if I touch his?

Ah!

<i>Hey! Yeah, come here!</i>

Come on, girl.

Let's go get 'em, okay?
Get that motherfucker!

Chump!
<i>You were so brave, papa!</i>

See how crazy I am
about you, girl!

Your audition ain't over yet.

Keep your eyes
on the road.

<i>Â¶ A good man</i>
<i>is hard to find Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ You always get</i>
<i>the other kind Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Just when you think</i>
<i>that he's your pal... Â¶</i>

Say, we still
$15 short.

10 is what everybody gets.
But we had a contract, sir.

Contract?
You must be one of them old country niggers.

Contra--

I'll cut you
every way but loose.

<i>Â¶ Hug him in the morning,</i>
<i>kiss him every night Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Give him plenty of lovin',</i>
<i>you know what I mean Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ And treat him right,</i>
<i>'cause a good man nowadays... Â¶</i>

And remember when we
did that show at Don's place?

Ah, you don't remember that.
Oh, lookit.

Lookit, J.G.
That's our corner.

That's our corner.
A penny a song.

I love you, Bessie!
You see that gin joint right there?

That's where I made
my first whole dollar.

Spent it, too.
<i>Â¶ Hug him in the morning, kiss him every night Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Give him plenty of lovin',</i>
<i>treat him right Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ 'Cause a good man nowadays</i>
<i>is hard to find Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Ah, yes,</i>
<i>hard to find... Â¶</i>

How y'all doing?
Oh, my God.

Â¶ A good man
is hard to find Â¶

Â¶ You always get
another kind Â¶

<i>Â¶ So if your man</i>
<i>is nice Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Take my advice...</i>
Come over here right now.

You know all them words?
<i>Yeah.</i>

You know
what you're singing?

Hold out your hand
right now.

Keep singing.

Make sure all
you're doing is singing.

<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

Mommy. Where's my mama?

Welcome home.
Come on inside.

Man

Hey y'all. How you doing?
How you doing?

Well, I guess you think
you're something.

How are you?

You care?

I think I'm gonna go show
Jack and Lucille around.

That's your man?

You got something
to eat?

Drink?
Oh, city gal, huh?

Can't stand to be in regular
folks' houses no more.

You still keeps
the food locked up.

That's right.

Y'all was like
little rats.

How else was I supposed to
keep the food in the house

and feed six people?
Come here.

Go get a case of Coca-Cola
and a lot of ice.

As many potato chips
and peanuts as you can get.

Oh, golly. Mm.

A whole case
of Coca-Cola.

After 10 years,
ain't you a saint?

Don't drink it all up.

You're one to talk.

Well, you're the one still
keeps the food locked up.

Don't look like you're
missing no meals.

Well, I sure didn't
get 'em here, did I?

I got some tickets
for the show tonight.

You want to bring
the family...

I got someplace
else to be.

You been by
Mama's grave yet?

No street signs,
no lights, no nothing.

Told ya, Mama,
this is Blue Goose Hollow.

I know this town better than J.G.'s ding-a-ling.

Yeah, this is my town!

<i>Hey, Bessie! Hey.</i>

Oh, you remember.
I know you remember...

Easy, papa.
Leave room for the Holy Ghost, now.

Good times with you two.

Woman

Hey.
Leave them gals be.

Yeah.
Get off of me.

What do you think this is?
I said leave 'em be!

Shut up, fat bitch.

What'd that fucker say to me?
I said--

Don't nobody try her.

She's in her gin, y'all.

...your little dancer

decided to come along
for the ride.

Y'all know how to ball!

And we're gonna
ball again tomorrow.

Hey, get back here!

<i>Clarence, help us.</i>

Where's a doctor?
<i>Get somebody!</i>

Get somebody! Hurry up.
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

<i>Oh, shit.</i>

<i>Help!</i>

Help!

Baby...

Bessie!
Hurry up!

Bessie!

<i>Bessie! Bessie!</i>
Mommy!

<i>Bessie!</i>
Mommy!

Bessie!
No!

Where's my mommy?

Where's Mama?

<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay, baby.</i>

Baby, it's okay.
Get off of me! Get off of me!

Get off of me!
She's okay. She's okay.

Why did you--
I'm right here, baby.

You let her get me.
I ain't going nowhere, I love you.

Jack <i>You gotta let that heal.</i>
<i>You gotta let that heal.</i>

Bess, you gotta let that heal.
We got a show to do.

No, no,
ain't no show. Ain't no show.

Bess!

<i>Bess!</i>

Bess!

<i>Nurse!</i>
Bess, what are you doing?

How much y'all pay
to get in here?

25 cents.
25 cent?

Hmm, I wouldn't pay 25 cent
to go nowhere.

Well, I guess I better
sing something, huh?

'Cause y'all spent
all that money.

<i>"Dear Miss Smith,</i>

<i>my name is</i>
<i>Harry Herbert Pace,</i>

<i>president of the newly formed</i>
<i>Black Swan Records</i>

<i>based in Harlem,</i>
<i>New York City.</i>

<i>I'm a great admirer</i>
<i>of your work,</i>

<i>having seen you perform</i>

<i>at the Royal Theater</i>
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

<i>News of your great talent</i>
<i>continues to precede you</i>

<i>and we would like to invite you</i>
<i>to an audition</i>

<i>at our offices in Times Square,</i>
<i>New York City,</i>

to be our first recording artist
signed to the Black Swan label!

Hoo!
Well, this is it.

I always wanted to live in New York City,
you know.

You're gonna be the biggest
thing since Mamie Smith.

You know how many records
she sold last year?

A million.
A colored outfit?

Ain't nobody heard of
no Black Swan.

<i>What you need is a national label.</i>
<i>Big-time.</i>

W.E.B. Du Bois' company
wants to record you, sis.

This is the big time!

So? I read his book.
I doubt you read his book.

I read the damn book.

What's that got to do with music?
This is the big ticket.

Bessie, this is what they're
calling Pan-Africanism.

Well, what about
Pan-Americanism?

Can she sell more tickets?
That's what I wanna know.

"The only genuine
colored records.

The others are only
passing for colored."

That's their motto.
I like that.

I like it, too.

"Yours in negritude,
Harry Herbert Pace."

The fuck is negritude?

That means they're real,
real black.

My kind of people.

Talk about passing.

Y'all is fried, dyed,
and laid to the side.

Well, and we are very
excited to be here.

<i>Very excited.</i>
We were surprised you could schedule the audition

so quickly given your
busy tour schedule.

We canceled the rest of
our tour to be here.

Well, that's, uh--
Well, y'all wanna hear me sing, right?

Yes. Yes, yes,
of course.

Is there anything else
that you need?

I need a little something
for this tea.

Honey, sugar, milk?

Splash of Old Tom
will be just fine.

"Old Tom"?
Gin?

I'm sorry, I-- I--

I don't know that we have any
or where we could find any.

You see, it's, ah...

I mean, it's illegal.
Never mind. It's okay.

No, it ain't okay.

You want her at her best,
then give her what she needs.

Oh, it's okay, papa.

Â¶ Oh... Â¶

Hold up.

Something ain't right.

<i>Â¶ Oh-- Â¶</i>

Ahem--

Â¶ I got a man I love Â¶

<i>Â¶ Why he had</i>
<i>to leave me? Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I got a man I love Â¶</i>

Â¶ Smart as he can be... Â¶

Dear Miss Smith,

while we appreciate your
downhome sound,

we do not feel
that it is a fit

for Black Swan Records.

We have chosen
to record instead

<i>a young lady who</i>
<i>we unanimously agree</i>

<i>has a more</i>
<i>compatible sound</i>

<i>and is a bright,</i>
<i>shining example</i>

<i>of the Harlem Renaissance</i>
<i>and an uplift to the race.</i>

<i>We hope you can appreciate</i>

<i>the difficulty</i>
<i>of our decision</i>

<i>and the choices</i>
<i>that must be made</i>

<i>in the name of progress.</i>

<i>We remain admirers</i>
<i>of your work</i>

<i>and hope that you will</i>
<i>keep us in mind</i>

<i>for your</i>
<i>future recordings.</i>

<i>You let her go in there and make a damn fool</i>

<i>out of herself.</i>
Pour me another glass of this corn.

Ain't nobody crying.
It was a good meeting, man.

<i>Hey, baby, look here.</i>
<i>Never again.</i>

Damn fools don't know nothing
about no talent.

I'm gonna get you
a real record deal!

I said I don't wanna
hear no more about it.

<i>What the hell you know</i>
<i>about anything?</i>

We've been in
this business

before you were wiping your own ass.
Look it here.

It's about damn time she started
taking advice from a nigger

that don't wear no
stage makeup!

Listen--

Give me some more
of this!

Give me some more
of all this stuff!

It'll pass.

...a couple of them
myself, too.

Are you sure?

<i>Hey, Bessie.</i>

This here Mr. Walker--
want to meet you.

The hell you bring
him here for?

<i>You remember him.</i>

Brought him by a couple
of your shows.

He wants to talk
to you about a record deal.

A real recording contract.
Miss Smith,

<i>I'd like to record</i>
<i>you for Columbia Records</i>

<i>for our new</i>
<i>Race Records division.</i>

What is a Race Record?
The one where they put a coon on the front?

What? Um, no, ma'am.

We at Columbia are taking
a different approach.

I'm not interested
in your Race Records.

And I'm not interested in wasting my
time singing no store-bought blues.

<i>But we want your sound.</i>

We want
the Bessie Smith sound.

And it would be
your face on the ad,

nothing like those other records.
I already sell out

every show from
Philly to Chicago.

Ain't nobody doing it
like I'm doing it.

You'd attract
a broader audience.

I've been doing
just fine without 'em.

I can offer you
50 dollars a side.

No royalties, of course.

Don't play with me now.

J.G.

Now, you want
what's in my jacket

or in my pocket?

I already know what's in your pocket.

Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

Now, what do you want?

This or this?

I want another velvet box.

Marry me.

You ou can't be
putting me upon no shelf.

I ain't no
henpecked man, either.

Take the chance on me.

Come here, girl.

Now, what's in
that other pocket?

Oh.

Uh, just
a recording contract

from Columbia Records.

<i>125 a side.</i>

That's double
what that man said.

That's 'cause I'm fighting
for you now, baby.

Well, maybe we should
tell Clarence.

Uh-uh. This here is
me and you now.

<i>All set. Let 'em know.</i>

Man

Man

<i>Take a listen.</i>
<i>This always takes...</i>

Everything all right,
Bessie?

Yeah, as soon as y'all
move this thing

out the way,
I'm ready to go.

Well, no, that's
the recording apparatus.

I know it's bigger than what--
It's crowding me.

Well, we need it to--

I don't need it.
Look, Bess, you got to--

Hey, hey.
I'll help her.

What's wrong?

It's gonna be just like
the last time.

No, it's not.
It ain't gonna go, J.G.

It ain't gonna go, J.G.
I know it.

I know how they do it.

They act like they're your pal,
and then it all comes loose.

You can't make no silk purse out of no sow's ear

just like Viola always said--
Damn Viola.

You hear me? Damn her.

Damn Black Swan.

Damn these crackers
in here.

Let's just go home.

Okay, we're going.
We're going now. Right now.

But sing one song,
honey.

The way you like it.

Don't sing it for me,
them, nobody.

You sing it
for yourself.

Now what you say?

<i>Okay, here we go, Bessie.</i>

<i>Mr. Gee, if you could just</i>
<i>step away from the cone--</i>

He's staying right here.

Um, okay.

Â¶ Gee, but it's hard
to love someone Â¶

Â¶ When that someone
don't love you Â¶

Â¶ I'm so disgusted,
heartbroken, too Â¶

Â¶ I've got those
downhearted blues Â¶

Â¶ Once I was crazy
'bout a man Â¶

Â¶ Who mistreated me
all the time Â¶

Â¶ The next man I get Â¶

Â¶ Has got to promise me
to be mine Â¶

Â¶ All mine Â¶

<i>Â¶ Trouble, trouble Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I've had it all my days Â¶</i>

Â¶ Trouble, trouble Â¶

Â¶ I've had it all my days Â¶

<i>Â¶ It seems that trouble's Â¶</i>

I love you. You're mine.

<i>Â¶ Going to follow me</i>
<i>to my grave Â¶</i>

Â¶ I ain't never loved but Â¶

Â¶ Three mens in my life Â¶

Â¶ I ain't never loved but Â¶

Â¶ Three mens in my life Â¶

<i>Â¶ My father, my brother Â¶</i>

Â¶ The man that
wrecked my life Â¶

<i>Â¶ I got the world in a jug Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ The stopper's in my hand Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I got the world in a jug Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ The stopper's</i>
<i>in my hand... Â¶</i>

Put that
on top of that box.

Hey.

Seems I done traced the lightning back to her source.

<i>Hey, boss. One more.</i>

What's your name?

Ain't too smart to give out names in my business.

Just call me your bootlegger.
And what do I call you?

You don't know who I am?

Oh, I know
who you are.

But what do you want me
to call you?

Oh, yes. Yeah!

What the fuck
is your name?

Richard.
Tell me your name.

Richard, baby!
My name is Richard.

<i>Come on, baby.</i>

Mm-hmm.

Right here.

Look good, huh?

Yeah!

Well, why is your
name on it?

Why is my name on it?

<i>'Cause somebody somewhere</i>
<i>right now putting</i>

a record on
listening to you.

You're making money
while you sleep.

<i>Ain't had to sing</i>
<i>a word this morning.</i>

It is fine.

A whole train.
<i>It was my idea.</i>

Told you six months ago
we should get a train.

Look here,
we're saving money now.

Ain't never have to go through
another third-rate backdoor again.

That's what I told you!

Yeah, well, some are talkers
and some are doers.

And, baby, I'm a doer.

And I done done it.

"Jack Gee presents."

Jack Gee presents
the most demonstrating,

syncopating, electrifying
woman in the world.

<i>My girl.</i>

How y'all feeling tonight?

Yeah!

Come on, now. Yeah!

Give a little bit.

Oh, this reminds me
of church.

What?
I think we might have to preach them blues tonight.

Yeah!

<i>Here, nigger,</i>
<i>nigger, nigger, nigger!</i>

Hurry!

Man

Give it here,
give it here.

<i>Come on, go around the side.</i>
<i>Go around the side.</i>

<i>Come on, let's move it.</i>

Bring it down!
We gotta get out of here.

<i>The Klan is here.</i>

<i>The Ku Klux Klan is here!</i>

It's gonna be all right.
<i>Come on, niggers!</i>

Man

Man

Man

<i>I bet you are!</i>

Don't go out there, Bessie!
They're gonna kill you.

Bessie, no!

Get on out of here!

What the hell
are you doing?

Get back.
Hey!

You better pick up
your sheets and run!

Get out of here.
I'm gonna get you!

<i>Get out of here!</i>

<i>We'll be back!</i>

<i>We'll be back!</i>

Â¶ Down in Atlanta, GA Â¶

Â¶ Under the viaduct
every day Â¶

Â¶ Drinking liquor
and hollerin' hooray Â¶

Â¶ Pianos playing
till the break of day Â¶

Â¶ But as I turned my head Â¶

Â¶ I loudly said Â¶

Â¶ Preach them blues Â¶

Â¶ Sing them blues Â¶

Â¶ They certainly sound
good to me Â¶

Â¶ I've been in love
for the last six months Â¶

Â¶ Ain't done worrying yet Â¶

Â¶ Moan them blues,
holler them blues Â¶

Â¶ Let me convert your soul Â¶

Â¶ 'Cause just
a little spirit Â¶

Â¶ Of the blues tonight Â¶

Â¶ Let me tell you, girls Â¶

Â¶ That your man ain't
treating you right Â¶

Â¶ Going on down the line
a little further now Â¶

Â¶ There's many
a poor woman down Â¶

Â¶ Read on down
to chapter nine Â¶

Â¶ Woman must learn
how to take their time Â¶

Â¶ Read on down
to chapter ten Â¶

Â¶ Taking other women's men,
you are doing a sin Â¶

Â¶ Sing 'em, sing 'em,
sing them blues Â¶

Â¶ Let me convert
your soul... Â¶

Here we go! Here we go!

Hey, Bessie!
We're praying for you!

Thank you, Bessie!

<i>Thank you!</i>

<i>Never thought it'd be like this.</i>

<i>You woke us up.</i>

Hit it again.

<i>New York is celebrated</i>
<i>for its transitory fads.</i>

<i>During the current season,</i>
<i>the Negro is in ascendency.</i>

Miss Smith, so wonderful
you could join us.

You're one of our
last guests to arrive.

Edgar! Mr.
Van Vechten, 4th floor.

Soon, doubtless, the homely
Negro songs of lovesickness

<i>known as "the blues"</i>
<i>will be better known</i>

<i>and appreciated by</i>
<i>white audiences.</i>

It's a little tight,
don't you think?

<i>Ooh, yeah!</i>

<i>Bessie Smith is here!</i>

Oh, you look fabulous!
I heard that you were wild.

Get the fuck off me.

Now, where's the good music,

the good food,
and the good liquor?

Langston Hughes is the greatest Negro poet of our time.

Oh. Who's the best
regular poet?

Langston,
how about a little poem?

I'm not feeling up to it.

Well, I'll sing
a note or two.

Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet, please.

Go, girl.

Miss Smith. Miss Smith,
I should warn you.

This crowd isn't...

<i>I have a treat.</i>
<i>I have a special treat.</i>

<i>The incomparable Bessie Smith</i>

is going to
sing us a song.

Â¶ Everybody's cryin' Â¶

<i>Â¶ The workhouse blues,</i>
<i>all day Â¶</i>

Â¶ Oh, Lord Â¶

Â¶ Oh, Lord Â¶

Â¶ The work is so hard Â¶

Â¶ Thirty days is so long Â¶

Â¶ Oh, Lord Â¶

Â¶ I can't plough Â¶

Â¶ I can't cook Â¶

<i>Â¶ If I'd run away,</i>
<i>wouldn't that be good? Â¶</i>

Â¶ Well, I'm goin'
to the nation Â¶

Â¶ Goin' to the territor' Â¶

<i>Â¶ The workhouse sits</i>
<i>way out a Â¶</i>

Â¶ Long old lonesome road Â¶

Â¶ I'm a hard-luck gal Â¶

Â¶ Get the devil
everywhere I go... Â¶

Mmm.

Where the drinks at
around here?

Let me get
a little something.

You are a treasure.

That was so beautiful
and so soulful,

and, frankly,
exactly the kind of dusky pathos

that I'm looking to capture

for my new book
"Nigger Heaven"--

Say what?
"Nigger Heaven," it--

You know
the only difference

between white folks
in the North

and white folks
in the South?

White folks in the South
don't care how close you get

as long as you don't
get too big.

And white folks in the North
don't care how big you get

as long as you don't
get too close.

<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>If Bessie Smith is crude and primitive,</i>

<i>she reflects the true</i>
<i>folk spirit of her race.</i>

<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

<i>Morning, Gee!</i>

I got something for you.

Got somebody I want
you to meet.

This here is Gertrude.

She's a singer.
Writes songs, too.

You know Claudine
dropped out in Cincinnati.

Got pregnant.

So I hired Gertrude
here to replace her.

What the fuck you showing her
to me for?

I don't know.

Thought maybe you might
have something to say.

Sort of like "welcome."

What kind of fucked-up name
is Gertrude?

You a half-breed?
Excuse us, please.

Go on and get yourself
something to eat, baby.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

I know you got your
side pieces,

but why you gotta
rub 'em in my face?

I'm just trying
to build a--

You want me to
sniff her for you, too?

I'm just trying to build
a show here, Bessie.

You got her
wearing my things.

I know you think
<i>I'm big and ugly.</i>

You think I'm blind
and dumb, too?

It ain't-- it ain't like you
ain't been tipping out, too.

I know it.
Tell me different.

Look.

Baby, I promise.
Cross my heart.

I don't love
nobody else but you.

And you don't love
nobody else but me,

<i>so the rest really don't</i>
<i>matter now, do they?</i>

<i>You know I don't think</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

You're my fine woman.

Look.

Let's start over, huh?

Let's me and you both
clean house.

Come on.

Let's try.

They said you had
your own train.

I didn't believe 'em.

But goddamn, sis.

You a high post
now, huh?

You ain't tell me
about all this.

You get that money I sent you?
Oh, yeah.

I get them little wires
you've been sending.

They're nice,
feeding four kids and all.

Okay, look.

I know you and I bump heads
most of the time,

but I'm just here
to show my support.

Mmm, real nice.

This is from Europe and...

what have you.

I got you something.

Probably not fancy enough
for you now, but...

I thought you'd like it.

I'm proud of you.

I'm so proud of you.

You gonna stay around
for a while?

Think Clarence could
get me tickets?

He's in the box office.

Thank you.

Come on.
Come on and see.

Come on in here.

Come on.

Come on, y'all.
Get inside.

The paint already fading.

<i>Take a look around.</i>

<i>Lord have mercy.</i>

<i>Look around,</i>
<i>breathe it in.</i>

<i>This is</i>
<i>something, Bessie.</i>

Smell different, don't it?

Listen here, Bessie.

We ain't talk about
getting no house.

I ain't see your name
on my bank book.

I mean,
I did it for us, papa.

I knew you'd like it.
<i>How the upstairs look?</i>

But if you did it for us,
why all of them got to move in here for?

And especially
why is she here?

Baby, she's gonna be all the way back in the house.

You ain't hardly
gonna see her.

I don't know why certain people's got they lip turned up.

Must be smelling something.

Damn right,
I'm smelling something.

Must be a dead rat
in the wall.

Must be.

Baby, stop.

Why you ain't
ask me first?

See if I was ready?
Well, I'm ready.

I want a real family,
not no road family.

I want the whole thing,
you know?

A big house
and everybody in it.

Well, everybody ain't gonna be in it if you
don't start showing me some respect!

I'm gonna put a big piano
right here,

<i>a big dining room table</i>
<i>is gonna go here.</i>

I'm gonna get me a nice rug
for that parlor.

And I'm gonna get me
a baby, too,

and I'm gonna put him
right in there.

A what?
Come see the-- a baby.

Come on, see the kitchen.

Always a pleasure.

Bess?

You're gonna have to start delivering.
I'm a married woman now.

I can't keep doing
these pick-ups.

No problem, ma'am.

What do you want?

I'll follow you home just like this.

You trot yourself out there swinging and dangling.
See what happens.

Yeah, suits me fine.

I don't want you for
no customer anymore, nohow.

Why not?

Every man in your life
is a business relationship.

Your brother's your partner,
your man's your manager,

and your woman
is your dancer.

And you're my
bootlegger.

Not no more.

Matter of fact,
I'm giving you a full 100 % refund.

Richard.
Look...

I don't wanna be
in business with you.

I want to be
in love with you.

I'll take the shine.

Fine, take it.
I'm giving it to you.

Not selling it.

I oughta get home to J.G.

Bess.

You don't have to pay
for something

that I'm already
offering for free.

I'm gonna spend it on you anyhow.

Shit.

Everybody!

I want you to meet
Jack, Jr.

Junior, this is my family.

Your new family.

That's your Uncle Clarence.
There's your Aunt Viola.

And this is your
new daddy, Jack.

<i>J.G., come meet your son, Jack, Jr.</i>

How old are you, boy?

Seven years old, sir.

Where are you from?

Shelby County
Children's Home, sir.

An orphanage?
Mm, mm, mm!

Jack, Jr:
<i>I don't know about that, sir,</i>

<i>but that's what</i>
<i>she told me to say.</i>

Well, what's your
real name?

My name is
Jack Gee, Jr., sir.

Oh!

Come on over here
and give your daddy a hug.

<i>Whoo!</i>

<i>Smells good in here.</i>

<i>Eat as much</i>
<i>as you want, Jack Jr.</i>

<i>Mmm!</i>
Happy Thanksgiving.

What you
looking at, Viola?

Come on, sit down here.

With that fork there.

Know how to use a knife?
Yes, sir.

<i>That piece of chicken right there.</i>

<i>You want some of this dressing here?</i>

<i>Wait till I'm finished.</i>

Come here!

<i>Bessie, where you at, baby?</i>

<i>Put 'em up.</i>

Yeah, guard yourself. Bam!

I'll knock you out.

Guard that face.
Bam, bam!

Come one, you ain't gonna
whup nobody like that.

Now, you gotta get in there,
baby. Come on. Pop!

Oh.
There you go. Pop!

There you go.
Get in there on him.

You can't get him if you're afraid to take one.

Block him.
Block now. Block!

What you trying
to do, huh?

What you trying
to do?

Get him, Mama!
Yeah, get him!

You gonna beat
your old man, huh?

Louis and I
are getting married.

You and who?

I can't no more.

I want a family.

Like you.

Showbiz life
can't last forever.

I just want
a normal life.

Thank you.

Stealing my baby!
You're trying to kill me.

Stop it, stop it!
Mama!

You ain't fit

Can't just leave him?
Just leave him, okay?

You're high, you're drunk.
You ain't fit!

You're just trying

You ain't gonna never

You're a liar!
I'll kill you!

<i>I'll kill myself.</i>

Go! Let's go!
<i>No! Stop!</i>

Hey, there's food here, now.

<i>You need to eat</i>

Come on.

You have anybody
under that name?

No.

Yeah, yeah,
I'll take it.

Mm-hmm.

<i>Â¶ Old, empty bed Â¶</i>
It's gonna be all right.

<i>Â¶ Springs hard as lead Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Feel like old Ned Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Wish I was dead Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ All my life through Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I've been so</i>
<i>black and blue Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I'm white inside Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ But that don't help</i>

<i>Â¶ 'Cause I can't hide Â¶</i>

We're going on a trip.

<i>Â¶ Ain't got a friend Â¶</i>
You ready?

Yeah.

<i>"I think Ethel Waters</i>

In fact, to my mind,
Miss Waters is superior

"Superior."

See how they love to instigate?
Set us up against each other?

Them's graveyard words.

Don't worry, honey.

No decent colored folk even read that silly magazine.

It ain't for us anyhow.

J.G. took Junior.

And he's trying to...

And he's...
Shh.

You just take care
of you right now.

Get your head right.

Things never
turn out straight.

Well, you can't hit a straight lick with a crooked stick,

and you're about
as crooked as they come.

Oh!

Now, this right here,
this used to be my favorite.

<i>See how it'd been</i>

You grew three sizes.

<i>Just like you</i>

It was like you had

Nothing or nobody else

Now...

You done heard the rest.

And I'm gonna

Ma gonna show ya

Â¶ Don't you see the dance Â¶

Â¶ They call your big
black bottom Â¶

Â¶ It'll put you

Â¶ Ha Â¶

Â¶ All the boys

Â¶ They say my black bottom
is really good Â¶

Â¶ Come on, let me show you,

Â¶ I want to learn that dance Â¶

Come on, Bess.
Come on. Get up.

Â¶ Early in the morning,
'bout the break of day Â¶

Â¶ Grandpa told my grandma,
I heard him say Â¶

Â¶ Come on and let me see
your big black bottom Â¶

Â¶ I want to learn
that dance, oh Â¶

All right now, Ma!
Come on now, honey.

Ah, too strong,

Oh, baby, too strong.

Oh, I love you, baby.

<i>I love you, too, Ma.</i>

Bring what you can.

<i>Â¶ Why I'm a ladies man Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ About the sweetest</i>

Here you go.
Hey, that's right, Gilbert. Don't be stingy now.

Hey, y'all, help yourself
to the kitchen, now.

Cooked up some good food.

Still got 'em

Hey, can I use this kitchen for a second, child,
if you don't mind?

Come on right back
and do as you please.

And how are you gonna have a
rent shake without a bootlegger?

You ain't my bootlegger,
remember?

<i>Â¶ ...pretty papa Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Falling on my knees Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I ask,</i>
<i>if you ain't got nobody Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Kind daddy,</i>
<i>take me please Â¶</i>

You wanna know how to really
make some money nowadays?

<i>Now--</i>
<i>Now, I'm serious, now.</i>

<i>This is only</i>
<i>for grown folks, now.</i>

If you plan on going to church
this morning, stop me now.

Play the damn record.

<i>Â¶ I got a man I love Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I got a man I like Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Every time I fuck</i>
<i>them mens Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I give em'</i>
<i>the doggone claps... Â¶</i>

Oh. Oh, my Lord.
She's so nasty!

Mm-hmm.

<i>Â¶ But that's the kind</i>
<i>of pussy that-- Â¶</i>

Oh, unh-uh,
that is too much.

Unh-uh, she is
just too rough.

These party records
going much further nowadays.

Mm-mm,
I can't go that far.

Well, you could always
dust something off,

do one of your
old numbers, you know?

Â¶ Rough cock, suck my cock Â¶

Â¶ You can tuck my cock-- Â¶

I ain't gonna suck, tuck,
or nothing else to nobody.

We can get close
to it, though.

<i>See, that's what I'm--</i>
<i>that's the spirit.</i>

Â¶ His frankfurters are,
oh, so sweet Â¶

Â¶ How I like his
sausage meat Â¶

Â¶ I can't do without
my kitchen man Â¶

<i>Â¶ Oh, how that boy</i>
<i>can open clam Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ No one else</i>
<i>can touch my ham Â¶</i>

Â¶ I can't do without
my kitchen man Â¶

Gin with no ice, right?

You know,
when I saw your name on the sign out front,

I thought it had to be some
sort of mistake or an imposter.

I-- I can't believe
it's you.

It is such an honor
to meet you, Miss Smith.

Alhambra Ballroom,
7th Avenue, 126th Street,

Harlem, New York, 1927?

I stand by it.
You changed my life.

That was six years ago,
sugar.

Change doesn't last
that long.

Oh, but it does.

I'm sorry. I'm John Hammond,
by the way.

Bessie, I wanna produce
your comeback tour.

And this is only the beginning.
You see, I'm putting together

a concert, right,
from spirituals to swing.

Nothing but
the best musicians.

We've got Benny Goodman,
Fletcher Henderson,

a young girl named
Billie Holiday.

She loves you so much--
Hey, slow down, now.

Sorry, I get excited.

Gonna build a new venue specially
for it called the Cafe Society.

The first integrated
nightclub.

No color lines,
no balconies.

Everyone under one roof
just swingin'.

You're dreaming, John.

Will you dream it
with me?

Sing some of
that old stuff?

I'm going in a different
direction now.

You know, trying on
some new shoes.

Okay, well,
whatever you're thinking,

I just wanna be
a part of it.

We'll see.

Give me a call?
Throw me a line?

Just wanna be
a part of it, Bessie.

Â¶ Laugh, frown, laugh Â¶

<i>Okay, this one is good,</i>
<i>with the dancer girl.</i>

<i>Now, see, I like</i>
<i>this one here.</i>

Look at this little smile.

Calvin,
how are you? Nice to see you.

This is Bessie Smith,
who I was telling you about.

We got everything
you might need.

Not those old weights
and pulleys.

Get tea.

Nothing but the best.
I see you got all the parts.

You got Buck Washington,
Chu Berry,

and this is
Benny Goodman.

Such an honor.

Well, well.

I didn't know
where you wanted to start,

so I put together every song
you ever wrote and then some.

<i>Â¶ It's a long, old road Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ But I'm gonna find</i>
<i>the end Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ It's a long, old road Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ But I'm gonna find</i>
<i>the end Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ And when I get there Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ I'm gonna shake hands</i>
<i>with a friend Â¶</i>

Â¶ Weeping and crying Â¶

Â¶ Tears falling
on the ground Â¶

Â¶ Weeping and crying Â¶

Â¶ Tears falling
on the ground Â¶

Â¶ When I got to the end Â¶

Â¶ I was so worried down Â¶

<i>Â¶ It's a long, old road Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ But I'm gonna find</i>
<i>the end... Â¶</i>

I do wanna know.

Know what?

What's over that next hill,
round the next corner.

Well, you can't
go back.

But you can stop.

No, I can't stop.

Well, let's go.

Well, let's go.

<i>25 cents? Ha!</i>

<i>No, no.</i>
<i>I wouldn't pay 25 cents</i>

<i>to go in nowhere!</i>

'Cause listen here...

<i>Â¶ Up in Harlem</i>
<i>every Saturday night Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ When the highbrows</i>
<i>get together Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ It's just too tight Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ They all congregate</i>
<i>at an all-night strut Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ And what they do is</i>
<i>tut, tut, tut Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Oh, Hannah Brown</i>
<i>from cross town Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Gets full of corn</i>
<i>and starts breaking 'em down Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Just at the break of day Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ You can hear</i>
<i>old Hannah say Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Give me a pigfoot</i>

<i>Â¶ He's got rhythm, yeah Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ When he stomps his feet Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ He sends me</i>
