Yo.

Hello?

Come out when you're done, bro.


<i>[crowd cheering on TV]</i>

Bam.
Ay.

That's the exact one you wanted, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

<i>It's the bottom of the eighth inning,</i>

<i>and so far,
it's been a very tight game.</i>

[smacking lips]

So Wonder Woman, huh?

What?

<i>Hitting .342
with 92 RBIs and...</i>

Look, Sammy, man, I'm not stupid...

and, um...

Look, you're becoming a man, all right?

You're gonna start having
feelings down there,

and you're gonna do shit and...

I mean, look, you're gonna like girls.

Girls are gonna like you,

and you're gonna wanna
do stuff with them.

But just do me a favor, all right?

I can't... I can't fucking pay
for another mouth

to feed in here.

So don't bring home
any fucking babies, okay?

Okay.
Okay.


[smacking lips]

<i>Unbelievable.</i>

<i>He'll be coming up here.</i>

<i>I can see that... I can see
that batter coming up...</i>

Why do some boys dress like girls?


Wha... what?
Why you asking me that?

<i>It's a hard hit!</i>

<i>Round to third, over to second...</i>

Today, I saw a guy dressed like a girl.

Yeah?
[sniffles]

Why does he do that?

Uh, I don't know why...
[sniffles]

I don't know why he does that.

I don't know.
He's, uh...

he's probably sick in the head.

<i>There's a runner on his too.</i>

Um, can a doctor help them?


I don't... I... I mean,

I don't know, but I don't think so.

I think people like that are
just kinda, like, born th...

You know, they're just, like,
born that way,

so that... that... that... that... no,
doctors can't help 'em.

Medicine?
[laughs, grunts]

Um, no.

I don't think medicine
can help them either, Sammy.

It's not like chicken pox.
You can't just cure it.

They're freaks, all right?

And that's just the way that they are.

[inhales sharply] So...

so nothing can help them?

No, man, people like that
aren't normal.

Didn't you hear me?
Yeah.


But... but why?
Jesus fucking Christ, Sammy.

I'm trying to watch the game,

and I'm trying to eat
my fucking food here.

What's wrong with you?
[sobs]

Nothing.

Sammy, what the...?

<i>[crowd cheering on TV]</i>

<i>Right here.</i>

<i>Home run, no men left on base...</i>

Oh, man.

<i>More baseball after these...</i>


Yo, what's up with you, man?

Huh?

Yo.

Listen, Sammy, I don't know
what's up with you, man,

but you've been acting weird
ever since I got home.

What's going on?
Huh?

Why you all sad and shit?

You mad 'cause I walked in
playing on your pee-pee?

Hmm?

You were playing with your pee-pee?

Come on, bro.
Yo.

Hey.
Come on.
