You're working rat patrol, mop top.

Jay, you're on parking-lot detail.
Keep it local.

And you, Peralta, the boneyard.

-This is private.
-You're not the law.

Go back to the Valley, you kooks!

my store, then, asshole?

Hey.

Go browse in the Valley, kook.

Okay, so, what?
You got cash, or...? What?

Man, l got something
better than cash.

These are urethane
skateboard wheels.

They're ure-what?

Urethane, man. lt comes from oil.

-From oil?
-Yep.

With these, you can do the same
hard turns you do on your surfboard.

-Yeah?
-Yep.

You can even climb walls, man,
because they grip.

-They grip?
-They grip?

-They grip.
-Shit.

-Sid. Sid, you should've seen us.
-Check these out.

They're urethane.
They come from oil.

And they grip.

That's right. Listen to the master.

Grab your pad
and take notes, Peralta.

Yeah, Tony.

Yeah, nice, T.A. Nice.

-Yeah, nice, Jay.
-Yeah, Jay boy.

Hey, Billy, man, if we built a decent

Sid. Out of here, man. Come on.

Thank you. You little maggot. Scat.

So, what do you think, man?

Well, there's more concrete in

Yeah, l hear that, man.
There's money in this.

There's only beer.

surfers wear watches, man?

-lncoming!
-Yeah, and where's he going?

Yeah, well...

Hopefully all of us.

-Come on.
-Shut up.

Hey, listen, when you're riding for one
of these shops around town-- Yeah?

You mean a little faggot shop?

And we're gonna have training

Don't worry about that.

Dude, l want you to have this.

Jay!

You learned that trick from me.
Watch this. l've been practicing.

-Hey.
-What's up, Jay?

Hey.

lt's not looking so good, man.

No, dude. There's an occasional set.
lt's really not that bad.

We were up at the Zephyr shop
yesterday with Skip and everybody...

...when you were at work.

And....

So Tony got on the team, right?

And Sid and Peggy and Biniak
and Red Dog and Shogo.

What about you?

Yeah, l got on.

Sorry, man.

lt's all right.

Hey, what's that?

With no end to the drought in sight,
authorities have announced...

...emergency measures
for water rationing...

-...that may force homeowners...
-Hey, Dad.

-...to keep lawns and pools dry.
-Hey, boy.

The Action 8 News Team
will explain--

Hey, they told us to conserve water.

We'll take you to the
drought conference--

-So how were the waves?
-Don't even ask.

Yeah.

Son of a bitch!

We're here.

Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on. Hey.

Wait, now. Wait.

Hey, one at a time.
One at a time, all right?

Oh, nice socks, man.
Nice socks. Nice socks.

Yeah, this is Skip Engblom
and the Zephyr Skateboard Team.

Here's our entry fees.
Now, where's our trophies?

Excuse me.
Go to the end of the line.

Yeah, l thought this was
the end of the line, man. ls it not?

-Go to the end of the line.
-Hey, man, listen. l'm--

-Yeah.
-Yeah? l'm sure we could...

-You're next now. Step up.

Son of a bitch.

Where's the course?

There's a nice L-Sit
by Russ Howell.

He's gonna press up now
into a handstand...

-...and back down on his board.
-ldiot.

What are we supposed to do
with this tabletop?

Dude, l don't know.

Looks like he's gonna end
with some 360s here.

Looks like three or four
of them at least.

Great run for Russ Howell.
Let's hear it for Russ.

What do l--?

Next up, Ty Page,
riding for Unity Skateboards.

Ty Page, starting off
with some 1 80 end-overs.

And now l think he's gonna--
He's gonna press up into a handstand.

There's a nice handstand across the
platform, back down onto his board.

Looks like he's setting up
for, yes, a daffy...

...and into a one-footed heelie.

And ends up with a 360
in front of the judges.

Nice run for Ty Page.

Looks like a 9.5, a 9 and 1 0 for
Ty Page. Those are real good marks.

Should put him right at the top
of the competition today.

Next up, Jay Adams,
riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

And there we go.

Okay, here we go with Jay Adams.

Nice.

Doing these low--
These low, driving turns.

Yeah, Jay boy.

-Low 1 80 with Royal Christie.
-All right, Jay.

Oh, but he's all right.

He's hopping up in the air
three or four inches.

l don't even know what to call that.
l've never seen it.

He's, like, off the ramp.

That's it for Jay Adams. Let's see what
the judges are gonna score him.

Yeah, dude. Oh, my God.

He didn't do a single wheelie.
He didn't do a single compulsory trick.

Well, you gotta give him a score.

Looks like two 7 s
and an 8 for Jay Adams...

-Oh, come on.
-...riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

You don't know how to judge.

Hey, you blew me away.

What? You want to blow me?

Maybe.

Next up will be Tony Alva,
riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

-Yeah.
-T.A.

Yeah.

He started out with some
quick S-turns up onto the bank.

-Frontside 1 80 power slide.
-That's it, T.A.

Very nice walking spinner.

lnto a 360, maybe a 540.

Another low-driving turn,
touching his hands to the ground.

Yeah.

Here he comes toward the judges.
Ends up with a low-driving 360.

That was a great run for Alva.

Looks like we have
two 1 0s and a 9...

-...the highest score of the day.
-Yeah.

Up next from Mar Vista, California,
an independent skater, Stacy Peralta.

The dude showed.

-Go, Stacy.
-Yeah, Stace.

Come on, Stacy.

-Yeah.
-Where'd that come from, Stace?

Up, up, using the whole ramp,
hands on the ground.

Yeah.

And there's another one of those
low maneuvers...

...out of the pages
of Surfer Magazine.

Looks like he's winding up
for some 360s.

One, two, three, four, five.

Five 360s. Amazing.
We haven't seen that many all day.

Hey, Stacy!

Back across the flat
and there's his finish.

Two 1 0s and a 9 bring him
into a first-place tie with Tony Alva.

Oh, my God.

-You're disqualified.
-What are you talking about?

-You touched the course.
-Everyone touched--

Read the rules. You're disqualified.

Hey, man. Hey, man. Look. Look.
The dude tied me.

Can your dirty ass even read?

-T.A.
-Yeah, Mad Dog.

-My dirty ass, right?
-Hey, ease up. Ease up, man.

-You saw that--
-Yeah, ease up.

-Hey. Off the fairgrounds.
-Cut these kids some slack, man.

-Slack?
-Yeah.

Who do you think you are, coming
to our contest and pulling this shit?

Pulling what shit, man? My boys
are kicking your girls' asses.

Every judge on the panel
is on your payroll.

What kind of shit is that, huh?

Watch it.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Step up to the plate, man.
One at a time.

You want it?
Come on, will it be all of you?

Come on. Yeah?

Come on.

Hey, look. All right.
lt's gone, all right?

Look, man.
These kids are at a tender age.

-They tense easily, okay?
-Yeah.

Your boy who punched
my official is out.

-Oh, come on.
-No concession.

-That's bullshit.
-Tony Alva's been disqualified.

-Next up, junior women's freestyle.
-Tony, wait.

Tony.

l just wanted Dad to see
the stupid trophy.

-Who gives a shit about Dad?
-Yeah, hey, hey, T.A., man.

Listen, you stood up for your friend,
man. We're proud of you.

This contest don't mean shit

Hey, come here. Look at me. Look,

of having a job.

Yeah, well, you got me there, man.

-We're going home.
-Okay.

Skip called me bro.

-Skip called you bro?
-Yeah, he said, ''bro.''

-No, he didn't.
-Yes, he did.

He said, ''You look hungry, bro.''

He said, ''You look hungry, bro''?

Yes, totally.

Skip Engblom
doesn't call anybody bro.

Let's see your trophies, Wentzle.

Take a seat, man.

Sit here, Kathy.

-Yeah!
-Yeah!

-Hey, guys.
-Yeah, Stacy.

-A toast!

To the boy kings!

You're all a bunch

This is a family restaurant!

Hey, get off him!

Hey! Hey!

Jay boy.

You kicked ass, man.

See you, Skip.

Hey!

Stop, stop, stop.

Right here. Right here.

Hey, isn't that the girl from Del Mar?

-Dude, what are we doing here?

You know how much this is
gonna cost me? You're an idiot!

Jesus.

-Down, guys.
-Get down. Get down.

Sid, get off me.

Grab your skates, boys. Let's roll.

Dude, are we gonna rob this place?

This wave breaks 2 4 hours a day,
every day.

And you know what, bros?
We're gonna be the first to ride it!

Dude! That's so genius.

Dude, there's no way.
This is way too gnarly.

Not if you got the balls.

Dude.

-Oh, Jay.
-Dude, you did a backflip.

Let's lose this stupid diving board.

Piece of shit.

Dude, hit it low, man.

Yeah, Tony!

Yeah! You guys see that?

Over the light.

Oh, my God!

-Dude, you were so far over it.
-That was crazy.

-Yes!
-Yeah!

Are you all right, man?

But then again,
l can never feel my feet.

-Right there! Through there.
-Where?

There's a pool right next door!
lt's an amoeba!

George! George!

Wait, wait. Right here.
