I still got feelings
you are my passion

You are the one
for me

I still got feelings
you are my passion

You are the one
for me

Can you,
can you hear me say?

When I'm moving closer
you keep going away

'Cause you're
my guilty pleasure

And you caught me
so tight

I wanna love you always
let's smile into the night

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me

Can you,
can you see the flame?

That burns inside my body
everytime you are here

'Cause you're the one I dream of
everyday and night

Don't give away my feelings
and come into my life

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me

Don't let go,
don't run away love

I still got feelings
you are my passion

Don't let go,
don't run away love

You are the one
for me
