<i>ONE SUMMER I HAD THIS FRIEND</i>

<i>WHO TOLD ME THAT ALL KIDS WERE</i>
<i>OPPRESSED.</i>

<i>I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANT,</i>

<i>BUT I WAS A KID, AND I WAS SURE</i>
<i>HE WAS RIGHT.</i>

<i>IT ALL SEEMED TO MAKE SO MUCH</i>
<i>SENSE.</i>

<i>I COULDN'T DRIVE,</i>
<i>I COULDN'T VOTE,</i>

<i>AND BACK THEN, IF YOU SAID WHAT</i>
<i>YOU THOUGHT,</i>

<i>YOU'D EITHER GET PUNISHED OR</i>
<i>SMACKED,</i>

<i>AND IF THAT'S NOT OPPRESSION,</i>
<i>WELL...</i>

<i>AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW THINGS</i>
<i>WORKED.</i>

<i>BACK THEN THERE WASN'T A LOT OF</i>
<i>ROOM.</i>

<i>YOU GOT UP AND WENT TO WORK,</i>
<i>AND WHEN YOU CAME HOME,</i>

<i>DINNER WAS ALWAYS ON THE TABLE,</i>
<i>EVEN IF YOU WERE A KID.</i>

<i>BUT NONE OF IT EVER MATTERED --</i>
<i>NOT THE WORK, NOT THE HEAT,</i>

<i>HELL, NOT EVEN THE OPPRESSION,</i>

<i>'CAUSE EVERY KID HAD THAT ONE</i>
<i>SUMMER --</i>

<i>A SUMMER THAT WAS THEIRS,</i>

<i>A SUMMER THAT WAS DIFFERENT.</i>

[ GRINDING ]

IS THIS THING GONNA MAKE IT?

WHO'S THAT?

THAT'S A PHOTO
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

AS A MATTER OF FACT, THAT'S A
VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

BUT YOU SCRATCH
A LITTLE DEEPER, YOU SNIFF.

THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND?

YOU'RE GONNA SEE SOMETHING THAT
EVERY MAN WANTS

BUT NO ONE'S EVER GONNA GET.

[ LAUGHS ]

NOT THE HERO, NOT THE KING,
NOT THE POET.

AS A MATTER OF FACT,

THAT'S A PHOTO
OF HEAT AND FIRE.

WELL, YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO YOUNG
TO UNDERSTAND.

I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A PICTURE.

HMM. WHAT WAS I SAYING?

OH, YEAH.

NOW, I'M A DOCTOR,

SO I CONSIDER MYSELF
EDUCATED --

HELL, EVEN ENLIGHTENED.

SO I HAPPEN TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

SO MUCH...

[ BRAKES SQUEAK ]

ANYWAY, MR., UH...

HOAGLUNG.

YEAH. J.M., RIGHT?

AH, NEVER MIND.

WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
AT THE CREST,

SO I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU GOT
HER FIXED UP, YOU KNOW?

QUICK AS YOU CAN.

COME ON, BOY.

BAD ENOUGH
WE'RE LATE AS IT IS.

BYE.

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER,
GRINDING ]

Henry!

Henry, get over here!

HENRY, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
CIN-- MISS WILDER.

YOU CAN CALL ME CINDY.

Hello.

SAY WHAT?
SPEAK UP, SON.

OH, I DON'T KNOW, CINDY.
KIDS TODAY --

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

SO...

DID YOUR FATHER TELL YOU ALL
ABOUT THIS JOB?

UNH-UNH.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

I MEAN, NO, MA'AM.

HE TOLD ME
THAT I HAD TO HAVE A JOB

SO I CAN BECOME, YOU KNOW,
ENLIGHTENED.

OH, ENLIGHTENED.

MM-HMM.
I MEAN, YES, MA'AM.

THAT'S CINDY.

YES, MA'AM -- CINDY.

[ CHUCKLES ]

THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S BETTER.

HANK, WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE THE
TWO OF US ALONE HERE TOGETHER?

I'M SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF
ENLIGHTENMENT TO SPREAD AROUND.

HENRY'S GONNA GET OFF WORK
ABOUT 7:00,

SO YOU CAN COME BY
AND PICK HIM UP THEN.

NOW, LISTEN HERE, BOY.

YOU LISTEN TO EVERYTHING
SHE HAS TO SAY.

STAY OUT OF TROUBLE, AND I'LL
PICK YOU UP AROUND 7:00.

CINDY...

I, UH, CAN'T REALLY THINK OF A
WAY TO...THANK YOU.

OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL THINK OF
SOMETHING.

YEAH, NO DOUBT I WILL.

I'LL BE OVER AT MY OFFICE IN
CASE THE BOY SCREWS UP.

SIT DOWN.

OKAY, HENRY.

I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE DOING HERE --

BUT FIRST, SOME RULES.

YES, MA'AM.

CINDY.

ONE -- NO DRINKING,
NO GAMBLING.

I DON'T WANT YOUR, UH,
ENLIGHTENMENT

TO COME AT THE COST OF MY
LIVELIHOOD.

TWO -- I DON'T LET ANY OF MY
EMPLOYEES TAKE CRAP

FROM ANYBODY BUT ME.

IF A CUSTOMER GIVES YOU
A HARD TIME,

YOU GIVE IT BACK TO HIM,
AND FAST.

AND NEVER LET THEM YELL AT YOU.

THEY DO IT ONCE --
IT BECOMES SPORT.

SO IF YOU'RE GONNA BREAK A RULE,
BREAK THE FIRST ONE,

'CAUSE I CAN PROBABLY HANDLE
YOUR DEBTS,

BUT YOUR DIGNITY'S
GOTTA BE WON.

NOW, I -- HENRY, LET'S GO.

ALL RIGHT. ONCE A WEEK I WANT
YOU TO BRUSH OFF THE TABLE.

YOU'RE ONLY GONNA BRUSH ALONG
THE EDGES

AND NOT WHERE IT'S WORN,

AND DON'T BRUSH TOO HARD, OR
YOU'LL WEAR THE FELT DOWN.

OH, THIS IS IMPORTANT.
PAY ATTENTION.

WHEN YOU'RE CLEANING OFF
THE TABLE,

MAKE SURE
THE CUSTOMERS SEE YOU.

THEY THINK IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT.

ME -- I DON'T THINK IT MAKES
A DIFFERENCE.

HENRY.

HUH?

I AM ONLY GONNA TELL YOU
THINGS ONCE.

IF I WANTED TO BE IGNORED, I
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED.

YES, MA'AM.

CINDY.

OKAY, I'M GONNA GO THROUGH IT
ONE MORE TIME.

PAY ATTENTION.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
WHAT?

YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME AGAIN.
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

YOU SAID THAT ONCE A WEEK I HAD
TO BRUSH THE TABLE,

NOT TOO HARD
AND ONLY AROUND THE EDGES.

THEN -- THEN -- OH, YEAH.

MAKE SURE PEOPLE SEE ME DO IT,
BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM HAPPY.

AND YOU -- YOU DON'T CARE.

[ LAUGHS ]

DID YOU SHOOT
ALL THESE ANIMALS?

NO, I STRANGLED THEM.

LET'S SIT DOWN OVER THERE.

HEY, WILLY.

HOW MUCH AM I GETTING PAID?

HUH. I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

I DON'T KNOW.

I GET PAID 50 CENTS A WEEK
ALLOWANCE.

HMM. 50 CENTS, HUH?

YEAH. DAD SAYS IT'S A LOT, BUT I
THINK HE'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW --

CHEAP?

YEAH, CHEAP.

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, HENRY.

I HAVE BEEN THINKING...

...ABOUT GIVING YOU
50 CENTS AN HOUR.

50 CENTS...AN HOUR?

WHAT, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH?

NO. THAT'S -- THAT'S --

A DEAL?

YEAH. A DEAL.

MMM.

GOOD.
NOW, LET'S GET TO WORK.

WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE?

CECIL!

CECIL, DAMN IT, GET OUT HERE!

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

OKAY. NEW RULE --
RULE NUMBER THREE.

WHATEVER YOU HEAR IN HERE STAYS
HERE, ESPECIALLY VOCABULARY.

THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND
OF...ENLIGHTENMENT

I DON'T THINK YOUR FATHER
WOULD APPRECIATE.

OKAY?
YES, MA'AM.

CINDY.

CECIL, GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE
RIGHT NOW!

[ GLASS BREAKS ]

OKAY, YOUR WHITENESS.
WHAT'S SO DAMNED IMPORTANT?

YOU KNOW, IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CHANCE THAT THIS WOULD TAKE,

I WOULD TRY TO TEACH YOU SOME
RESPECT.

NO, NOT A CHANCE.
IT WOULDN'T TAKE.

WHO'S THE KID?

THIS IS HENRY STURBUCK.
I'VE HIRED HIM FOR THE SUMMER.

YOU'RE KIDDING.
THE DOCTOR'S KID?

THE ONE THAT --
CECIL!

OH, YEAH.

YEAH.

CECIL -- RUNNING BEAR.

HOW DO YOU DO?

LOOK AT THAT -- ALMOST LIKE
MANNERS.

LOOK HERE, PRINCESS.

INDIANS AND KIDS --
WE GOT SOME THINGS IN COMMON.

WE'RE BOTH OPPRESSED.

OHH!

COME HERE, KID.
I'LL SHOW YOU THE ROPES.

I'M GOING OVER TO CARSON CITY.

LYNETTE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
AT 5:00,

WHICH MEANS YOU'LL SEE HER
AT 6:00.

AND, HENRY,

ONLY BELIEVE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT
MR. SLEEPING BEAR SAYS.

WHICH HALF?

THAT'S <i>RUNNING</i> BEAR.

[ <i>COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING</i> ]

WE NEED TWO MORE CASES OF BEER
OUT HERE!

HENRY!

BY THE TIME YOU'RE DONE I'M
GONNA NEED FIVE CASES.

SORRY.

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

NOTHING.
IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE --

THEY'RE TOO --

[ GROANS ]

HEY, J.M...

...HOW'D YOU LIKE A FREE DRINK?

LOOK HERE.

YOU HELP ME OUT, AND NOT ONLY
WILL I GIVE YOU A FREE ROUND,

BUT NEXT TIME THERE'S A FIGHT,

I'LL LET YOU BOUNCE
THE WHITE GUYS.

I DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE NO ONE,
CECIL.

HOW MUCH IS THIS <i>FREE</i> DRINK
GONNA COST?

NOTHING.

[ CHUCKLES ]

HONEST!

LOOK, ALL I NEED IS A LITTLE BIT
OF CHARITY

AND TWO MINUTES OF YOUR TIME.

WE GOT A NEW KID JUST STARTED
WORKING HERE TODAY.

HE'S KIND OF SMALL,

SO HE'S HAVING A PROBLEM
HAULING CASES OF BEER.

I'D HELP HIM, BUT THEN I'D HAVE
TO LEAVE THE BAR UNATTENDED.

WHERE'S LYNETTE?

WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHERE LYNETTE
IS?

I GUESS SHE IS WHERE SHE ALWAYS
IS WHEN SHE SHOULD BE WORKING.

SO, HOW 'BOUT IT?

CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?

MAKE IT TWO ROUNDS.

YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE
TO CLEAN THEM UP LATER.

DON'T CARE.

GUESS NOT.

I THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY.

IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T GIVE
UP JUST YET.

I MEAN, WHAT
WOULD YOUR FATHER THINK?

SCREW HIM.

THAT'S WHAT CECIL SAID.

IF ANYONE BOTHERS YOU OR DOESN'T
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

SCREW 'EM.

CECIL TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

YEAH.

HE SAYS NEVER TAKE ANY CRAP
FROM ANYONE.

OTHERWISE THEY'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
ALL THE TIME.

THEN THEY'LL START TO TREAT
YOU LIKE AN INDIAN --

OR WORSE, A NIGGER.

DID CECIL TELL YOU ALL THAT?

UH-HUH.

WELL...

...I DON'T THINK I'D LISTEN
TO EVERYTHING

THAT CECIL, OR, FOR THAT MATTER,
ANYONE TOLD ME.

AND I KNOW I'D SURE THINK ABOUT
WHAT THEY TOLD ME

BEFORE I WENT AROUND
REPEATING IT.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

WELL, IF SOMEONE TOLD ME
SOMETHING

THAT WAS JUST PLAIN STUPID

AND I WENT OUT AND REPEATED IT
BEFORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

THEN WHOEVER I WAS TALKING TO

MIGHT THINK
ABOUT WHAT I TOLD THEM

AND WALK AWAY THINKING <i>I</i> WAS
STUPID.

KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

GUESS SO.

HEY,
WAS THAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

WHO?

YOU KNOW -- THE WOMAN FROM THE
PICTURE IN YOUR TRUCK?

MARILYN MONROE?

YEAH.
IS THAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

YEAH. SURE IS.

Cecil: J.M.!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE CASES?!

WHITE NATIVES
WANT TO TAKE A DRINK!

PUT THE BEER IN THE COOLER,
KID.

I THINK
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S PRETTY --

EXCEPT FOR HER HAIR.
IT DON'T LOOK REAL.

I MEAN, I NEVER SAW A WOMAN
WITH HAIR LIKE THAT --

YOU KNOW, THE COLOR?

I DON'T THINK I EVER SAW A MAN
WITH HAIR LIKE THAT EITHER.

SORRY I'M LATE.

WHO'S THAT?

THE CAVALRY.

SHE'S A MOVIE STAR.

THAT WOMAN -- THE ONE
WHO JUST CAME IN HERE --

IS A MOVIE STAR?

NO, NOT LYNETTE,
THOUGH SHE THINKS SHE IS.

I MEANT MARILYN MONROE,
THE WOMAN IN THE PICTURE.

YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
A MOVIE STAR?

[ Laughing ] NO, KID.
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

BUT YOU SAID THAT SHE WAS.

SORRY, KID.
I WAS JUST PLAYING WITH YOU.

I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU SAW HER
IN THE MOVIES.

I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A MOVIE.

OH.

SO, IF THAT'S NOT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND,

THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE HER
PICTURE?

I DON'T KNOW.

I GUESS SHE JUST SEEMED KIND OF
SPECIAL TO ME,

LIKE EVERYTHING IN THE MOVIES --
IT'S SPECIAL.

AND IT'S NOT LIKE A BOOK OR
RADIO.

MOVIES ARE BIG.

I GUESS GOING TO A MOVIE

IS KIND OF LIKE GOING TO,
YOU KNOW, CHURCH --

SORT OF RELIGIOUS.

YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IF
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN,

BUT, I MEAN,

THE PEOPLE SEEM SO BIG
AND SO REAL.

AND THEN WHEN YOU LEAVE,
WHEN THE SHOW'S OVER,

IT'S LIKE...YOU THINK THEY'RE
GONNA BE WAITING FOR YOU

RIGHT OUTSIDE.

ARE THEY?

NO. THEY NEVER ARE.

BUT IT DON'T MATTER.

I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
TO THEM IF THEY WERE.

BUT THEN...

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

SOMEONE LIKE MARILYN COMES
ALONG,

AND YOU KNOW, SOONER OR LATER,

SHE'LL BE THERE
WAITING FOR YOU...

RIGHT OUTSIDE.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

I'D MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY...

MAKE IT BETTER.

YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHTA GO SEE A
MOVIE SOMETIME.

THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.

WHY NOT?

WELL...IT'S MY MOM.

SHE'S KINDA --

SHE'S NOT REALLY --

SHE SICK?

NO.

SHE'S CATHOLIC.

I UNDERSTAND.

TOO BAD, THOUGH.

THERE'S A GOOD MOVIE PLAYING
AT THE DRIVE-IN

OVER IN CARSON CITY --

"SOME LIKE IT HOT."

IT'S ONE OF MARILYN'S.

[ CHUCKLES ]

I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
IT'S GONNA BE THERE.

THAT'S A SHAME.
YOU REALLY SHOULD SEE IT.

Man: HEY, TONTO!

I SAID, "HEY, TONTO!"

BRING ME ANOTHER BEER.

THAT'LL BE 50 CENTS.

PAY YOU WHEN I'M READY.

PAY ME NOW.

HEY, CECIL.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

I NEED 50 CENTS.
HE OWES YOU 50 CENTS.

WELL, LOOKS AS IF YOU DON'T EVEN
NEED ME AT ALL.

AND WHO IS THIS
NEW LITTLE MISTER?

DON'T BE AFRAID, SON.

LYNETTIE WON'T BITE.

Cecil:
NOT IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

I HEARD THAT, CECIL.

HENRY, MA'AM --

HENRY STURBUCK.

THE DOCTOR'S SON!

I HEARD YOU WERE GONNA BE
WORKING HERE.

NICE TO MEET YOU.

NOW, DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT A THING,

FOR I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
UNDER MY WING

AND MAKE SURE NOTHING BUT GOOD
HAPPENS TO YOU.

COME ON.

THINK WE'LL SEE HIM AGAIN?

I DON'T KNOW.

I'M TOLD WOMEN LIKE THAT EAT
THEIR YOUNG.

I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

[ THUD ]

DAMN RABBITS.

SO, TELL ME ABOUT WORK.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY?

MEET ANYBODY...INTERESTING?

MM-HMM.

GOOD, GOOD.

WELL, I'M GLAD IT'S GOING SO
WELL FOR YOU.

LISTEN, WHEN WE GET HOME, I'M
NOT GONNA HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

I GOTTA GET TO A KIWANIS
MEETING.

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I BE THERE --

TOWN BUSINESS.

AND THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING

ABOUT A MOVIE COMPANY
COMING TO TOWN.

SO...I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
THE CHANCE

TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER

AND TELL HER ALL THE THINGS THAT
HAPPENED TODAY AT WORK WITH YOU,

FILL HER IN ON ALL THE DETAILS
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW YOUR MOTHER
FEELS ABOUT YOU WORKING.

YOU KNOW HOW YOUR MOTHER FEELS
ABOUT <i>WHERE</i> YOU'RE WORKING.

YOU KNOW HOW YOUR MOTHER FEELS
ABOUT YOUR...ENLIGHTENMENT.

SO SINCE I'M NOT GONNA BE
AROUND,

I'M GONNA LEAVE IT UP TO YOU

TO TELL HER ABOUT YOUR GREAT
FIRST DAY AT WORK.

SO, HOW'S THAT SOUND?

I SAID, "HOW'S THAT SOUND?"

YES, SIR.

"YES, SIR."
THAT'S MY BOY.

WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.

I'M MAKING DINNER!

HI, MOM.

HEY.

HOW WAS YOUR DAY, SWEETIE?

FINE.

HENRY...
YOU'LL SPOIL YOUR DINNER.

HENRY, TRY TO BE SLIGHTLY
CIVILIZED.

PUT THE BROWNIE ON A PLATE.

HERE, GIVE ME THAT.

HELLO, DEAR.
HAVE A NICE DAY?

IT WAS OKAY.

MM-HMM. GOOD.

HENRY, CAN YOU GET ME A BOTTLE
OF TONIC WATER?

UH...WHERE'S THE MAIL?

SO, WHAT DID YOU DO?

OH, THE USUAL.

DOTTIE AND I DROVE UP TO RENO.
WE PASSED BY FAIRCHILD'S.

I GOT YOU SOME NEW BOXERS.
THEY'RE IN THE BUREAU.

I, UH, WON'T BE ABLE TO EAT
DINNER WITH YOU.

UM, I GOT A KIWANIS MEETING.

HENRY, GO WASH UP.

YOU KNOW, I HAD A REALLY, REALLY
GOOD TALK WITH THE BOY

ON THE WAY HOME.

I THINK THIS JOB'S GONNA BE VERY
GOOD FOR HIM.

I'M STILL NOT SO SURE A BAR IS
THE RIGHT PLACE

FOR A 12-YEAR-OLD TO SPEND A
SUMMER.

Nonsense.

IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

MOM?

YES, DEAR?

CAN I GO TO THE MOVIES TOMORROW
NIGHT WITH J.M.?

HE INVITED ME.

J.M.?

YEAH, I MET HIM AT WORK.

HE'S MY FRIEND.
YOU'D REALLY LIKE HIM.

ASK YOUR FATHER, HON.

DAD, CAN I GO TO THE MOVIES
TOMORROW?

NOT NOW, HENRY.
I'M LATE ENOUGH AS IT IS.

YOU SHOULD COME TO THE CREST AND
VISIT.

YOU'D REALLY LIKE IT.

I DON'T THINK SHE'D LIKE IT.

WHERE'S MY GOOD WHITE SHIRT?

WHICH ONE?

THE ONE THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
MY GOOD BLUE SHIRT.

DIRTY.

BUT I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU I
NEEDED IT FOR TONIGHT.

NO, YOU DIDN'T.

AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU HAD A MEETING.

AND NEXT TIME YOU'RE GONNA BE
MISSING DINNER,

I'D APPRECIATE
A LITTLE NOTICE.

WELL, I'M...SORRY.

UM...

LOOK,
I'M LATE ENOUGH AS IT IS.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS...LATER.

DON'T WAIT UP.

MMM.

GONNA BE A LATE ONE.

BUT WAIT.
DAD, CAN I GO TO THE --

ASK YOUR MOM.

MOM, CAN I GO TO THE MOVIES
TOMORROW NIGHT?

MOM?

AND CECIL -- HE'S THE INDIAN.

I TOLD YOU HE WAS THE INDIAN,
RIGHT, MOM?

YES, HONEY.

WELL, HE THINKS
I'M OPPRESSED.

OPPRESSED?

YEAH. KIDS AND INDIANS -- CECIL
SAYS THEY'RE BOTH OPPRESSED.

AH. WHAT ELSE DOES
MR. RUNNING BEAR HAVE TO DAY?

HE SAYS NEVER TAKE --

I MEAN, TO ALWAYS THINK ABOUT
WHAT SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU

BEFORE YOU REPEAT IT.

THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

WELL...HE DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE
THAT

OR REALLY, YOU KNOW, SAY IT.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HENRY?

NOTHING.
CAN I GO TO THE MOVIES?

OH, HONEY, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

WHY NOT?

HENRY, YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THE MOVIES,

AND THE CHURCH SAYS
THERE'S TOO MUCH --

TOO MUCH -- TOO MANY THINGS

THAT COULD INFLUENCE
A YOUNG PERSON THE WRONG WAY.

IT'S JUST THAT THIS FRIEND
ASKED ME.

AND WHO IS THIS FRIEND?

J.M. I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM,
REMEMBER?

I SAID YOU'LL LIKE HIM.

OH?

YEAH.

HE --

HE'S REAL RELIGIOUS.

YOU'RE KIDDING.

NOPE. SHE SAID YOU CAN TAKE ME
TO THE MOVIES.

I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MUCH
TOUGHER,

BUT THEN I TOLD HER HOW
RELIGIOUS YOU WERE.

RELIGIOUS?

YEAH. THEN SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
FOR A FEW MINUTES

AND SAID, "OKAY."

BUT, OF COURSE,
I HAD MY FINGERS CROSSED.

'CAUSE YOU LIED.

'CAUSE I WANT HER
TO LET ME GO.

WELL, THAT'S REAL GOOD,
KID, BUT --

MY NAME'S HENRY, AND YOU DID --
YOU INVITED ME.

I'M NOT TAKING NO KID TO THE
DRIVE-IN.

[ <i>TELEPHONE RINGS</i> ]

<i>HELLO?</i>

<i>MA'AM, THIS IS REX STETSON.</i>

<i>OH, HELLO...</i>

IT'S NOT GREAT.

<i>OH, I'D LOVE TO HAVE DINNER</i>

<i>YES, I AM ON THE LINE.</i>
<i>WOULD YOU PLEASE GET OFF IT?</i>

<i>ALL RIGHT,</i>
<i>BUT YOU'RE ON MY HALF-HOUR.</i>

<i>REX, REX, ARE YOU THERE?</i>

SHOW UP ONE NIGHT TOO LATE,
AND WHAT DO YOU GET?

A DATE WITH A KID.

DORIS DAY INSTEAD OF
MARILYN MONROE.

COULD YOU PLEASE BE QUIET?
I CAN'T HEAR.

PERFECT. JUST PERFECT.

<i>I GET A NICE, WARM FEELING</i>
<i>BEING NEAR YOU, MA'AM.</i>

â™ª <i>PILLOW TALK</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>ANOTHER NIGHT OF GETTIN' MY</i>
<i>FILL OF PILLOW TALK</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>MY PILLOW AND I</i>
<i>BOTH AGREE...</i> â™ª

THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING.

YEAH, REALLY SOMETHING.

CAN WE STAY FOR THE NEXT ONE?

LOOK, KID --

HENRY.

UH-HUH.

IT'S BAD ENOUGH I HAD TO SIT
THROUGH "PILLOW TALK,"

BUT "SOUTH PACIFIC" IS A
MUSICAL, AND SINGING IS OUT.

[ ENGINE SPUTTERS ]

COME ON, NOW.

[ ENGINE SPUTTERS ]

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

ALL RIGHT.

...SEE A MOVIE...

MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE ALMOST IN IT.

A MOVIE LIKE THAT --
"PILLOW TALK."

SO NEXT TIME, IF WE CAN'T SEE
MARILYN, THEN WE DON'T GO --

UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THERE'S A WESTERN

OR, BETTER YET,
A WAR MOVIE.

DEAL.

WERE YOU IN THE ARMY?

SURE, I WAS IN THE ARMY.

IN THE KOREAN WAR?

NO. WORLD WAR II.

DID YOU LIKE IT?

[ CHUCKLES ]
NO ONE LIKES THE ARMY, KID.

THEN WHY'D YOU GO?

WELL, MY PEOPLE --

PEOPLE?

YEAH, PEOPLE --
YOU KNOW, MY FAMILY.

ANYWAY, THEY, UH -- WE ALL LIVED
IN MISSISSIPPI.

AND AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW,

LIVING IN MISSISSIPPI
AND BEING POOR --

I GUESS I JUST FELT LIKE
FIGHTING A DIFFERENT BATTLE.

THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR?

HENRY...

COME ON. TELL ME.

HENRY! YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE.

YOU KNOW? FIGURE OUT IF THEY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THINGS.

WELL? YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT THE WAR?

NOT REALLY.

I WAS IN THE ARMY --

THE 92nd...INFANTRY.

WE WERE 25 GUYS, ALL OF THEM
JUST LIKE ME.

NONE OF US HAD NEVER SEEN
NOTHING BUT OUR OWN BACKYARDS,

AND HERE WE WERE...

FIGHTING THE BEST HITLER HAD.

WHAT HAPPENED?

WELL, WHEN WE WEREN'T MARCHING,
WE WERE FIGHTING,

AND WHEN WE WEREN'T FIGHTING, WE
WERE SLEEPING IN THE MUD.

I PRETTY MUCH KEPT TO MYSELF
AS BEST I COULD,

BUT THE FUNNY THING IS...

...YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME
WITH PEOPLE,

WATCHING THEM FIGHT

AND WATCHING THEM DIE,

IT DON'T MATTER WHO THEY ARE
OR WHERE THEY'RE FROM.

THEY BECOME LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

YOU KNOW...I ALMOST HAD
A BROTHER ONCE.

ALMOST?

YEAH.

WE ALMOST HAD ANOTHER BABY.

WHAT HAPPENED?

WHAT'S THIS DO?

WHAT?

THIS.

[ CLICKS ]

IT'S BROKE.

OH.

NOW DO ME A FAVOR.

YEAH?

NEXT TIME...BEFORE
YOU TOUCH SOMETHING...

YEAH?

...ASK.

SORRY.

IT'S NO PROBLEM.

NOW,
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THAT ONE?

IT'S MY FAVORITE.

WHOA!

HEY, J.M...

HMM?

YOU EVER WANT
TO GET MARRIED?

I SUPPOSE.

THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

I GUESS I'M JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT GIRL.

LIKE MARILYN?

YEAH, KID.

LIKE MARILYN.

SEE YA.

[ BELLS JINGLE ]

[ BELL DINGS ]

[ GRUNTS ]

DO ME A FAVOR, KID.

HENRY.

YEAH.
TELL THEM I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

WHO?

THE PEOPLE AT THE PUMPS.

[ BELL DINGS ]

THEY LEFT.

WHATCHA DOIN'?

WORKING.

NEED ANY HELP?

NO.

DON'T YOU HAVE TO WORK?

YEAH.

DAD DROPPED ME OFF EARLY.

CECIL SAID
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON --

THAT I SHOULD COME BACK
IN AN HOUR.

HE SAID HE'LL COVER FOR ME.

THAT'S FUNNY.

WHAT?

I SAW CECIL TAKE OFF
ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO.

OH.

YEAH.

CAN YOU HAND ME
THE VISE-GRIPS?

IT'S OVER THERE.

THE RIGHT.

THE RIGHT!

THAT'S IT. YEAH.

NEXT TO THE OILCAN.
LET ME SEE.

YEP. THAT'S IT.

WHERE'D YOU LEARN THIS STUFF?

WHAT?

WORKING ON CARS.

I DON'T KNOW.

I GUESS MY FATHER.

OH.

YEP.
I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE.

12?

NO. PROBABLY
A LITTLE YOUNGER.

ANYWAY, MY DAD WOULD SPEND
SATURDAYS WORKING ON CARS.

AFTER ABOUT A YEAR
OF WATCHING,

HE PUT A TOOL IN MY HAND AND
SHOWED ME HOW TO USE IT.

I WISH MY DAD WOULD DO THAT.

WHAT?

TEACH ME SOMETHING.

LOOK, KID,
YOUR DAD'S A DOCTOR.

WHAT'S HE GONNA TEACH YOU,
HOW TO YANK AN APPENDIX?

IT'S NOT THAT.

WHAT IS IT THEN?

IT'S JUST THAT, WELL,
HE'S NEVER AROUND.

HE'S ALWAYS GOING OUT
TO MEETINGS

OR TO CHECK ON HIS PATIENTS
AND STUFF.

HE NEVER USED TO DO THAT.

NO?

NO. HE ONLY STARTED
WHEN MY MOM LOST THE BABY --

MY BROTHER.

OH, YEAH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

ONE DAY DAD TOLD ME HE WAS
TAKING MOM TO THE HOSPITAL

AND THAT WHEN THEY'D GET BACK,
I'D HAVE A NEW BROTHER.

AND WHILE SHE WAS STILL
AT THE HOSPITAL,

ALL THESE FLOWERS STARTED
COMING INTO THE HOUSE.

THEN A COUPLE DAYS LATER WHEN
SHE CAME HOME,

SHE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND
STARTED TO CRY.

SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE WAS REAL SORRY

AND THAT MY BROTHER
WAS WITH JESUS.

AND...WHILE SHE WAS UPSTAIRS,

DAD CAME OVER AND PUT HIS HAND
ON MY SHOULDER

AND TOLD ME
I BEST MAKE HIM HAPPY

'CAUSE I WAS THE ONLY SON
HE'D EVER HAVE.

SHE'S BETTER NOW, THOUGH --
MY MOM.

OH, YEAH.

AT FIRST SHE WASN'T.

I'D COME HOME FROM SCHOOL,

AND SHE'D BE LYING
ON HER BED, CRYING.

BUT SHE'S OKAY NOW.

I THINK SHE'D LIKE IT
IF MY DAD WAS AROUND MORE.

[ BELL DINGS ]

I'LL GET IT.

[ VEHICLE APPROACHES ]

[ BRAKES SQUEAK ]

[ CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

HI, MOM.

HEY. WHAT HAPPENED?

DID DADDY'S CAR BREAK DOWN
AGAIN?

NO, HE GOT A CALL.
SOMEONE'S SICK.

DID HE SAY
WHEN HE'D BE HOME?

EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

I WAS OVER AT THE CREST

WHEN YOUR HUSBAND ASKED IF I
COULD GIVE HENRY A RIDE,

AND HE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU NOT
TO WORRY AND START YOUR DINNER.

OH, THANK YOU, MR...

HOAGLUNG -- J.M. HOAGLUNG.

THIS IS MY FRIEND, MOM.
REMEMBER? I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM.

HE'S THE ONE WHO TOOK ME
TO THE MOVIE.

OH.

I HOPE I DIDN'T GET HIM HOME
TOO LATE.

NO, NO. I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
HENRY'S FRIEND WAS A --

IT'S OKAY, MA'AM.

NO, MR. HOAGLUNG, NO.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

I HOPE THAT THIS WASN'T AN
INCONVENIENCE.

MY HUSBAND LOSES SIGHT OF THINGS
WHEN THERE'S AN EMERGENCY.

HE'S A DOCTOR, YOU KNOW.

I KNOW, MA'AM.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

I INVITED J.M. FOR DINNER.

THANK YOU, HENRY,
BUT I BEST BE GOING.

YOU GOTTA EAT SOMEWHERE.

PLUS MOM'S
A REALLY GOOD COOK.

OH, HENRY, I'M SURE
MR. HOAGLUNG --

IT'S J.M., MA'AM, AND IT'S OKAY.
I'VE REALLY GOTTA RUN.

COME ON, MOM.

MR. HOAGLUNG,
I DID COOK FOR THREE,

AND WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE
YOU AS OUR GUEST.

THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD, AND IT'S
SO RARE HENRY HAS A FRIEND OVER.

COME ON IN.

PLEASE.

HENRY, GO AND SHOW J.M.
WHERE TO WASH UP.

COME ON, J.M.

THANK YOU, MA'AM.

COME ON.

GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

NO, N-O.

YOU ARE NOT GONNA DO IT.

YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE YET --
NOT EVEN ONE.

LET'S JUST DO THIS ONE.

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

YOU READY? OKAY.

BOOK.

BOOK. MM-HMM.

YOU SURE YOU NEVER PLAYED
THIS GAME BEFORE? MAYBE ONCE, MA'AM.

CALL HER MAUREEN.

YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!

AND HE'S RIGHT --
PLEASE CALL ME MAUREEN.

FIRST WORD --

THERE IS NO TALKING
IN CHARADES.

BOOK. HOW MANY WORDS?

OKAY.

COME ON.

TWO WORDS.            TWO WORDS.

FIRST WORD.          FIRST WORD.

ME. HE. HE?

MAN.

UH, GUY. SHIRT. COWBOY.

FRIEND.

COME ON!

NO TALKING!          NO TALKING!

TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

FIRST WORD.          FIRST WORD.

FIRST WORD SOUNDS LIKE --

SOUNDS LIKE WHAT?

SOUNDS LIKE "COLD."

SOUNDS LIKE "COLD."
OLD?

"OLD YELLER."

<i>"OLD</i> YELLER"?

GOOD JOB.

OLD? OLD?
YOU'RE SAYING I'M OLD.

IS HE SAYING I'M OLD?

YOU'RE SAYING I'M OLD.

IT'S TIME FOR BED.

OH, IS HE LUCKY.
I'M NOT OLD!

I'M NOT OLD!

OH, LORD, HELP ME.

[ LAUGHS ]

[ DISHES CLINKING,
WATER SPLASHING ]

OLD.

OLD.

KIDS.

DO YOU THINK I'M OLD?

WELL, J.M., TO HIM,
WE'RE ALL OLD.

I GUESS WE ARE.

THANK YOU.

NO PROBLEM.

MY MOTHER ALWAYS TAUGHT ME TO
CLEAN UP AFTER MYSELF.

NOT FOR THAT.

WELL, YES, FOR THAT.

IT SEEMS TO ME YOU MAKE A MESS,
YOU CLEAN IT UP.

MOST MEN DON'T.

THE MESS PART COMES EASY.

IT'S <i>TOO</i> EASY.

HENRY'S VERY FOND OF YOU.

YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY MESS THERE

THAT YOU CAN'T CLEAN UP,
ARE YOU?

I WRAPPED UP THE LEFTOVERS AND
PUT THEM IN THE FRIDGE.

THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR SANDWICHES.

MY HUSBAND WILL ENJOY THEM
LATER.

YOU GOT A GOOD BOY, MA'AM.

I know.

THANK YOU.

HE'S GOT A GOOD HEART.

I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE GETS THAT.

OH, I THINK YOU DO.

NO, I DON'T, MR. HOAGLUNG.

WITH CHILDREN YOU'RE ALWAYS
LOOKING TO SEE

WHERE THEY GOT WHAT THEY GOT.

WHEN SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR BABY,

THEY'RE SAYING SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR SOUL.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR SOUL.

HENRY'S PROOF OF THAT.

DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU HOW
LUCKY YOU ARE, MR. HOAGLUNG?

NOT OFTEN, MA'AM.

WELL, WHEN THEY DID, DID YOU
BELIEVE THEM?

NOT REALLY.

YOU'RE A SMART MAN.

ALL MY LIFE PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS
TELLING ME HOW LUCKY I WAS,

AND I ALWAYS BELIEVED IT.

THAT'S A PROBLEM.

HOW IS THAT?

YOU KNOW THAT THING ABOUT THE
GLASS

BEING HALF FULL,
HALF EMPTY?

YEAH.

WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE

AS LONG AS YOU DON'T STOP AND
LOOK AT THE GLASS.

YOU CAN BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU
WANT ABOUT ANYTHING

AS LONG AS YOU DON'T LOOK
TOO CLOSE,

'CAUSE WHEN YOU DO,

YOU REALIZE JUST HOW EMPTY
YOUR GLASS REALLY IS.

THAT MAY BE SO, BUT --

NO, THAT IS SO, MR. HOAGLUNG.

MAYBE, BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYONE

WHO HASN'T HAD THEIR GLASS
EMPTIED A LITTLE,

BIT BY BIT.

EVERY HEARTBREAK OR HURT,
EVERY DISAPPOINTMENT,

TAKES A SIP, SOMETIMES EVEN A
GULP, FROM THAT GLASS.

WHAT YOU GOTTA HOPE IS

THAT SOMETHING, OR BETTER YET,
SOMEONE, COMES ALONG

AND FILLS THAT GLASS BACK UP.

WE ALL GOT OUR HURTS, MA'AM.

THERE YOU GO.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

GOT YOU ANOTHER PLASTIC MONKEY,
HENRY.

LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS HIM.

I GET THE UMBRELLAS, THOUGH,
OKAY?

IT'S SO PRETTY.

THANK YOU.

I NEED THREE MORE BEERS.

AND CAN YOU TURN ON SOME MUSIC?

IT HELPS ME TO REMEMBER
MY DRINK ORDERS.

YOU SCARE ME, LYNETTE.

I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

MUSIC?

YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN
THAT ROAD.

HENRY?

YES, MA'AM?

DON'T FORGET TO SWEEP
<i>BEHIND</i> THE BAR AS WELL.

OKAY.

MISS WILDER?

CINDY.

YEAH.

I REALLY LIKE IT HERE.

EW!

WHAT?

WHAT ARE THEY?

PIGS' FEET.

I JUST MADE THEM THIS MORNING.
YOU WANT ONE?

NO. THANK YOU.

I NEED A VODKA MARTINI,
A GIN AND TONIC, A PINK LADY,

A VODKA GIMLET,
AND A MANHATTAN.

And can you please turn on
some music?

I almost forgot my drink order.

MANHATTAN? MIXED DRINKS?

MUSIC TO MY EARS.

They want to talk to you --

the people that ordered
the fancy drinks.

WHO THE HELL ARE THEY?

WHAT THE HELL'S
A MANHATTAN?

HEY, KID, HOW DO YOU SPELL
"GIMLET"?

THEY WERE SO NICE --

THOSE PEOPLE
CINDY'S TALKING TO.

THEY CALLED ME "MISS" AND SAID
"PLEASE" AND "THANK YOU."

THEY MUST NOT BE FROM AROUND
HERE.

[ SIGHS ]

ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW?

THEY'RE ALL MARRIED AND PROBABLY
THEY'VE ALL GOT THE CLAP.

FROM THE OFFER THEY JUST MADE,
I WOULDN'T EXPECT A BIG TIP.

WHAT OFFER?

OH, THEY SAY THEY'RE FROM
SOME MOVIE COMPANY

AND THEY WANT TO USE THIS PLACE
FOR THEIR PICTURE.

THEY WANT TO USE IT.
THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT.

A MOVIE? WHEN?

MID-AUGUST.
HEY, KEEP SWEEPING.

YES, MA'AM.

I SAW A MOVIE ONCE.

IT HAD ROCK HUDSON
AND DORIS DAY.

"PILLOW TALK"?

YEAH. I LIKED IT.

IT WAS KINDA, YOU KNOW,
RELIGIOUS.

[ LAUGHS ]

WHITE PEOPLE.

EXCUSE ME, SIR.

HIM OR ME?

YOU, SIR.

DEFINITELY NOT FROM AROUND HERE.

UH, PIGS' FEET?

NO, THANKS.

YEAH, LOOK, TELL YOU WHAT --

YOU TURN THAT 6 AROUND TO A 9,
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO USE
THE ODEON.

GUESS YOU WILL.

ODEON'S BETTER FOR
THE ART DEPARTMENT ANYWAY.

I DIDN'T WANT THEM HERE
ANYWAY.

DON'T YOU LIKE THE MOVIES?

YEAH, IN THE THEATER,
NOT IN MY BAR.

I SHUT DOWN FOR A DAY --

ALL THESE PEOPLE
GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.

NO, THEY WOULDN'T.

HENRY, PEOPLE DON'T COME HERE
'CAUSE THEY'RE LOYAL.

PEOPLE COME HERE 'CAUSE THEY
WANT TO DRINK --

ALL EXCEPT A DESPERATE FEW.

WELL, HOW COME <i>THEY</i> COME HERE?

'CAUSE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT
LYNETTE'S FANNY.

NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE FINISH
SWEEPING?

IT'S BAD ENOUGH THEY TAKE OUR
LAND.

NOW THEY WANT TO TAKE OUR
DIGNITY.

WHAT DID HE WANT?

WANTED ME TO BE IN HIS DAMN
MOVIE.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I SAID, "HOW...MUCH?"

HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
AND SAID TOO LITTLE.

I SAID, "JUST BECAUSE MY FACE IS
ON A NICKEL

DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO KISS THE
BUFFALO'S ASS."

WHO DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA BE IN IT?

CLARK GABLE,
MONTGOMERY CLIFT.

HELEN TWELVETREES.

WHO?

AN ACTRESS FROM THE '20s --
A REAL CREDIT TO HER RACE.

YEAH, WELL,
THEY COULDN'T GET HER,

SO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SETTLE
FOR MARILYN MONROE.

MARILYN MONROE?

I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, KID.
SHE'S NO HELEN TWELVETREES.

[ BELL DINGING ]

DAMN IT!

[ SIGHS ]

I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, HENRY.

I THINK IT'S A FINE IDEA,
MAUREEN.

I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
MOM.

SEE? EVEN THE BOY THINKS
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

HENRY.

LOOK, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA

WHAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION COSTS
NOWADAYS?

HENRY,
THE BOY IS 12 YEARS OLD.

WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT MONEY.

WHAT HE NEEDS
AND WHAT I NEED

IS TO HAVE YOU
AROUND THE HOUSE.

WELL, I CANNOT SEE HOW BEING
ON CALL TO A MOVIE COMPANY

TAKES UP ANY MORE OF MY TIME

THAN BEING ON CALL TO A
HOSPITAL.

AND, BESIDES, WHEN ALL OF THIS
IS DONE, WE'LL TAKE A VACATION,

AND WE'LL SPEND TIME...

TOGETHER.

NOW, PASS THE POTATOES, PLEASE.

THANK YOU, SON.

SO, CINDY SAYS,
"IF YOU'RE SO SMART,

WHY AIN'T YOU WORKING FOR ME?"

AND?

I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND SHE WAS RIGHT.

I AM SMART,
SO I TOOK THE JOB.

OH?

I WANTED TO BE A COOK.

I GUESS I AM, IN A WAY.

I BOIL EGGS...

KEEP THE PICKLE JAR FULL.

YOU ALWAYS GOT
YOUR PIG'S FEET!

YEAH. I'VE ALWAYS GOT
MY PIG'S FEET, HUH?

HEY! HEY!

[ Panting ] I GOT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

WHAT?

SHE'S COMING.
MARILYN'S COMING.

I KNOW.

YOU KNOW?

I KNOW.

HOW?

HOW DO YOU THINK I KNOW?
SHE CALLED ME.

SHE DID?

LOOK, KID --
HENRY.

YEAH.
HOW LARGE IS THIS TOWN?

DAMN!

ANYWAY, CECIL TOLD ME...
ABOUT THE MOVIE.

MARILYN DIDN'T CALL.

OH.
SHE PROBABLY JUST FORGOT.

YEAH. THAT'S IT, KID.
SHE JUST FORGOT.

DO ME A FAVOR, KID.

HOP UP IN THE CAB
AND HIT THE CLUTCH.

WHERE IS IT?

WHAT?

THE CRUTCH.

NO, THAT'S <i>CLUTCH.</i>

IT'S THE PEDAL
ON THE LEFT.

DIDN'T ANYONE EVER SHOW YOU
HOW TO DRIVE?

JUST EASE IT OUT.
EASE IT OUT.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY AND GET
YOURSELF INTO A BETTER GEAR?

[ GEARS GRINDING ]

ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, LOOK, OKAY?

KEEP IT AS STRAIGHT
AS YOU CAN.

LOOK, LOOK, YOU GOTTA KEEP
YOUR EYE ON THE ROAD.

THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT.
UH, HENRY? HENRY?

HENRY? HENRY...

ALL RIGHT, TRY THIS.

OKAY, LEAN BACK.

OH, YEAH, MUCH BETTER.

GOOD.

OKAY, JUST EASE IT OUT.
EASE IT OUT.

NO, EASE IT OUT.
NO, NO, NO.

THIS IS HARD.

I KNOW IT'S HARD, HENRY,

BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO
WHAT I'M SAYING...

IT'S JUST LIKE A DANCE,
YOU SEE?

THE CLUTCH COMES OUT,
ACCELERATOR GOES IN.

JUST LIKE A DANCE, YOU SEE?
GENTLY.

GOOD. GOOD. GOOD.

KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE ROAD.
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

NOW YOU REMEMBER --

AS YOU LET IT OUT,
JUST EASE IT UP.

LET IT OUT,
JUST EASE IT UP.

TRY IT.
DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

I'M SORRY.

NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

SEE, THAT ONE YOU CAUGHT
A LITTLE QUICKER THAT TIME.

YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

YOU GOT IT BACK,
SO YOU'RE GOING TO LET IT GO.

GET IT BACK.

OH. I'M SORRY.

NO, YOU'RE DOING WELL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU'RE GONNA BE DRIVING
IN A MINUTE.

YOU'RE GONNA BE DRIVING
IN A MINUTE.

THIS IS GOOD.

THIS IS GOOD.
EYES ON THE ROAD.

10 AND 2. YOU'RE RELAXED.

DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT AGAIN?
OKAY, TRY IT AGAIN.

[ NO AUDIO ]

YOU ALL RIGHT?

I'LL LET YOU...
TAKE A TURN AT IT.

LET ME GET INTO THE BACK.

THEN YOU COME AROUND,
AND YOU CAN START IT UP, OKAY?

ALL RIGHT. HOLD UP.

HENRY! WHOA!

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

[ BOTH CHUCKLE ]

I THINK YOU GOT HIM.

[ CHUCKLES ]

Henry: I WAS GONNA HIT YOU,
BUT J.M. TOLD ME NOT TO.

I DID NOT.

YOU DID, TOO.

NO, WHAT I SAID WAS,

"YOU SHOULD HIT
HIS WORTHLESS BEHIND."

YOU SAID I COULD NOT HIT HIM

'CAUSE YOUR INSURANCE
WOULDN'T COVER IT.

I KNEW YOU LOVED ME.

YECH.

YEAH, YECH.

[ Chuckling ]
I WOULDN'T HAVE HIT YOU.

NEVER HAPPEN.

WE FAST. MOVE LIKE ELK.

PLENTY CAUTIOUS.

OLD TRUCK, BAD BRAKES --
YOU NEVER KNOW.

[ CHUCKLES ]

[ POOL BALLS CLACKING ]

DUST -- TOO MUCH DUST.

EVERYWHERE AROUND HERE --
DUST.

YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE?
I HATE THE HEAT.

YEAH,
I HATE THE HEAT, TOO.

YEAH, THAT HEAT --
YOU GOTTA HATE IT.

YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
I HATE?

HOMEWORK.

HOMEWORK?

YEAH, I HATE IT.
YOU HATE HOMEWORK?

IF <i>YOU</i> HATE HOMEWORK, KID,
<i>I</i> HATE HOMEWORK.

YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HOMEWORK IS.

ARE YOU SAYING
I'M IGNORANT?

NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS
SET AN EXAMPLE FOR THE KID.

[ BLOWS ]

NICE DUST.

DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I HATE THE DUST?

WHAT DO YOU HATE,
J.M.?

NOTHING.
NOTHING?

AW, HE'S JUST TRYING
TO BE AN EXAMPLE, KID.

I AM NOT. I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING I HATE.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

YEAH, ME NEITHER.

SUIT YOURSELVES.

WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT MOVIE
COMPANY IS COMING HERE?

LYNETTE SAYS
IT'S BECAUSE OF HER.

I JUST THOUGHT OF
SOMETHING I HATE.

STUPID CONVERSATIONS.

[ CHUCKLES ]

HERE, WRITE DOWN THE NUMBERS
FOR ME, OKAY?

THAT MOVIE COMPANY'S GONNA
BE HERE TOMORROW.

THEY'RE GONNA BE RIGHT DOWN
THE STREET FROM THE ODEON.

IS THAT SO?
"HIGH-TEST -- 3,042."

GUESS WHAT MY DAD SAID.

HE'S WORKING ON IT, YOU KNOW.
HE'S THEIR DOCTOR.

3,032?

I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME,
AND THAT'S <i>42.</i>

42.

I'M SORRY.

IT'S OKAY.

ANYWAYS, DAD SAID
CLARK GABLE'S REAL NICE.

HE MEET HIM?

NO.
THAT'S WHAT HE HEARD.

[ CHUCKLES ]

WHAT?

NOTHING.

"REGULAR -- 4,395."

YOU THINK YOU'LL SEE HER?

LOOK, HENRY...

MARILYN MONROE AIN'T
SOMETHING REAL TO ME.

SHE'S JUST --
SHE'S JUST A DREAM.

I DON'T KNOW HER,

AND SHE AIN'T NEVER GONNA
KNOW ME.

BUT SHE'S GONNA BE RIGHT DOWN
THE STREET!

LOOK, I GOTTA GET BACK
TO WORK!

<i>YOU</i> SHOULD GET BACK
TO THE CREST!

THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING
FOR YOU.

EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
EXCUSE ME.

WATCH IT.

JEEZ.

EXCUSE ME.

DON'T PUSH ME.

THEY WOULDN'T LET ME
PARK THERE.

I GOTTA GET THAT STUFF
FROM MY STORE.

HEY, LYNETTE! LYNETTE!

LYNETTE!

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

TO WORK.
WORK?

IN THE MOVIE,
SILLY MISTER.

YOU? IN THE MOVIE?

I GUESS THEY JUST RECOGNIZE
REAL TALENT WHEN THEY SEE IT.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE?

AN EXTRA.

AN EXTRA?
WHAT'S THAT?

WELL, THAT'S SOMEONE WHO...

WHAT DID THEY SAY?

OH, YEAH.

IT'S SOMEONE WHO PROVIDES
ATMOSPHERE.

SOUNDS PRETTY IMPORTANT.

IT IS.

BUT...

WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?

THEY'RE EXTRAS, TOO.

BUT THEY'RE NOT EXTRASPECIAL
LIKE ME.

NOW, I GOTTA RUN,
LITTLE MISTER.

I CAN'T BE LATE FOR WORK.

BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS LATE
FOR WORK.

OUT OF THE WAY, KID!

Man: ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, I NEED
YOUR FULL ATTENTION ON THIS ONE.

I NEED YOU TO PAY ATTENTION
TO ME.

THE MORE YOU COOPERATE
WITH ME,

THE EASIER IT'S GONNA BE
ON ALL OF US, OKAY?

PAY ATTENTION TO ME.
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO.

I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
TO DO, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

EXCUSE ME, SIR,
HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAD?

YEAH, LOOK, I GOT 400 EXTRAS
HERE,

MOST OF THEM IDIOTS,

ALL OF THEM LOOKING
INBRED.

HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW WHICH ONE'S YOUR FATHER?

HE'S A DOCTOR --
DR. STURBUCK.

YOU'RE THE DOCTOR'S KID?

NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
COULD MAKE THAT UP.

HE'S OVER THERE.

ALL RIGHT, NOW LISTEN UP,
DAMN IT.

ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE

WITH THE LAST NAMES BEGINNING
WITH "A" THROUGH "F,"

MOVE OVER THERE.

THE REST OF YOU SIT TIGHT
AND WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

[ WOMEN GIGGLE ]

...YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOME ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE.

NOW, NOT MANY, GRANT YOU,

BUT SOME ENLIGHTENED JUST
THE SAME.

HEY, DAD!

UH...HI, SON.

LADIES,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

WHO ARE THEY?

WHO'S THAT?

THOSE LADIES -- THE ONES
YOU WERE JUST TALKING TO.

OH, <i>THEM.</i>

UH...WELL, THEY WORK
ON THE MOVIE.

THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT
PEOPLE.

WHAT DO THEY DO?

THEY'RE --
THEY'RE EXTRAS.

[ CHUCKLES ]
I THOUGHT THEY WERE PRETTY.

REALLY?
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU
AROUND A LITTLE BIT?

THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE FILMING
THE MOVIE -- OVER HERE.

HOW ARE YOU DOING,
OFFICER?

WHY DO THEY NEED
THE LIGHTS ON?

SAY WHAT?

WELL, IT'S SUNNY OUT.

OH, WELL, I'M SURE THAT IT'S
BECAUSE IT'S --

IT'S FOR EFFECT.

WHO'S THAT?

THAT RIGHT THERE?

UH, THAT'S, UH...

UH, MISS PAULA STRASSBERG.

WHO?

SHE'S MARILYN MONROE'S
FRIEND.

WHY WOULD MARILYN HAVE A FRIEND
THAT LOOKS LIKE <i>THAT?</i>

YOU SEE THAT MAN
RIGHT OVER THERE...

STANDING THERE WITH
THE COWBOY HAT ON?

THEY ALL HAVE COWBOY HATS
ON.

SON, THE ONE THAT LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE CLARK GABLE?

OH, UH-HUH.

IT'S NOT HIM.

IT'S HIS STAND-IN.

[ Chuckling ] WHOA.

HAVE YOU MET HER?

WHO?

MARILYN.

WHO?

MARILYN MONROE.

OH.

YES, I HAVE MET
MISS MARILYN MONROE.

WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

I-I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SPEAK WITH HER

BECAUSE SHE WASN'T FEELING
VERY WELL, BUT...

I-I DID LOOK HER OVER,

AND I PRESCRIBED SOME MEDICINE
FOR HER SO SHE COULD --

SHE COULD SLEEP.

I'M SURE I'LL HAVE TO COME BACK
AND SEE HER AGAIN,

AND WHEN I DO,

I'LL GET AN AUTOGRAPH
JUST FOR YOU.

WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?

WELL, LOOK FOR YOURSELF.
SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

DAD...

CAN I BRING A FRIEND
DOWN?

SHH.

PICTURE'S UP!

CAN I, DAD?

HENRY, SHH. WHATEVER.
SURE. GO.

AND WE ARE ROLLING.

HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN J.M.?

WHAT?

MY TRUCK BROKE DOWN.
I'M LOOKING FOR HIM.

NO, BUT I CAN CHECK
THE GARAGE AND SEE --

HE'S NOT.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

IF YOU SEE HIM, TELL HIM
I'M LOOKING FOR HIM.

J.M.?

HEY, J.M., YOU HERE?

J.M.

HEY, I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

IT'S REAL IMPORTANT.

YOU IN HERE?

J.M., HEY, J.M.

I'LL TRY THE CREST.

WANT A BITE?

YECH.

JUST KIDDING!

YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARE.

THERE'S PLENTY OF FEET
OUT BACK.

MMM!

TASTES JUST LIKE CHICKEN.

[ SIGHS ]
HAVE YOU SEEN J.M.?

HUH?

I'M LOOKING FOR J.M.

I AIN'T SEEN HIM.
I SAW LYNETTE, THOUGH.

YEAH, I SAW HER.

YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS, WOULD YOU?

WHAT'S LYNETTE DOING,
ANYWAY?

SHE'S AN EXTRA.
LOOK, IT'S REAL IMPORTANT --

AN EXTRA?!

FINALLY SOMEBODY'S PAYING HER
TO KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT!

LOOK, CECIL, IT'S REAL,
REAL, REAL IMPORTANT

THAT I FIND HIM.

WHO?

J.M.!

IF YOU SEE HIM,
TELL HIM I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

WHERE ARE YOU GONNA BE?

AT THE MOVIE SET WHERE ALL
THE BIG TRUCKS ARE.

WATCH IT, KID.

HEY, GERONIMO.

YOU GET ME A BEER.

AND...COME TOM! COME ON!

COME ON.

COME ON, PUPPY.

COME ON!

OH, DAMN IT. [ SIGHS ]

COME.

COME ON.

IF I DON'T SIT DOWN
RIGHT NOW,

MY FEET ARE GONNA FALL
RIGHT OFF.

[ SIGHS DEEPLY ]

I DO NOT KNOW
HOW THEY DO IT.

A BODY WOULD GO CRAZY DOING IT
DAY AFTER DAY.

WHAT?

STANDING AROUND AND DO NOTHING
BUT WAIT.

I USED TO THINK IT'D BE
SOMETHING TO BE A MOVIE STAR,

BUT AFTER TODAY,
NO, THANK YOU.

I'D JUST AS SOON
KEEP WORKING FOR A LIVING.

[ SIGHS ] BOY, THIS MAKES
MY FANNY FEEL GOOD.

YOU BEEN HERE LONG?

OH, A FEW HOURS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

LOOKING FOR J.M.

WELL, I KNOW WHAT I
AM LOOKING FOR,

AND IT AIN'T NO J.M.

IT'S A HUSBAND.

[ CHUCKLES ]

THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE,
TOM.

COME ON, PUPPY.

[ SIGHS ]

AT LEAST A HUSBAND'S
TRAINABLE...

IF YOU GIVE HIM
THE RIGHT REWARD.

IS THAT ALL
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

NO.

IT'S NOT.

[ Sighing ] I'M LOOKING TO GET
AS FAR AWAY FROM DAYTON

AS I CAN.

I THINK I'LL DO JUST
ABOUT ANYTHING

TO GET OUT OF THIS DUMP.

I DON'T KNOW.
I KIND OF LIKE IT HERE.

THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE A KID
AND YOU HAVEN'T LIVED.

WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR J.M.?

YOU AN EXTRA?

WELL, GET YOUR TUSH
OVER TO THE SET.

WHAT'S A TUSH?

NOW!

WHERE WERE YOU?

WORKING.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

WELL, COME ON.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE!

DO ME A FAVOR, KID.
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

IF YOU COME RIGHT NOW,
YOU CAN STILL MEET HER.

MEET MARILYN,
MAKE IT ALL BETTER --

JUST LIKE YOU SAID,
J.M.

SHE WAS RIGHT THERE.

EXCUSE ME?

SHE WAS THERE,

AND I FIGURED A WAY
TO SNEAK UP TO HER TRAILER.

MAYBE YOU CAN MEET HER,
TALK TO HER!

MAYBE SHE'D EVEN COME
TO THE CREST!

DON'T YOU WANT TO MEET HER?

YOU SAID YOU DID.

[ CLANGS ]

WHAT?

I ONLY GOT THREE THINGS
IN LIFE --

A BUSTED-DOWN GARAGE,
A TOW TRUCK, AND MY DREAMS.

THAT WOMAN IN THE TRAILER --

SHE'D TAKE ONE LOOK
AT ME,

AND YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE'D SEE?

I GOT MY DREAMS, HENRY!
THAT'S ALL I GOT!

NOT ALL DREAMS
ARE MEANT TO COME TRUE.

AND WHATEVER THEY TELL YOU,
KID...

LIFE AIN'T NO FAIRY TALE.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

[ COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ]

COMING THROUGH, COWBOY!

I'M GONNA FIRE HER
THIS TIME!

THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
THE LAST TIME.

HENRY, YOU'RE MOVING AT THE
SPEED OF A WHITE MAN.

WHERE'S LYNETTE?

PROBABLY OUT STUDYING
HER LINES.

I'M GONNA NEED
MORE GLASSES.

EXCUSE ME.

EXCUSE ME.

EXCUSE ME.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

GO TELL SITTING BULL WE'RE
GONNA NEED SOME MORE BEERS.

THOSE GUYS OVER THERE
WITH JESSE

NEED A COUPLE MORE
BEERS.

WHOA!

I THINK
THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH.

THEY NEED TO GO ON HOME.

YOU BOYS HAVING FUN?

Man: OH, YEAH!

OH, COME ON!

SHE'LL BE FINE.

CINDY --
SHE CAN HANDLE DRUNKS

BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE CAN
HANDLE GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE AWFUL DR--

YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
THEY ARE AWFUL.

I MEANT DRUNK.
I KNOW.

BUT DESPITE HOW THEY LOOK,
THEY ARE HARMLESS --

AT LEAST UNTIL THEY DRIVE.

THAT'S WHEN THEY GET
REAL DANGEROUS.

YOU EVER DREAM?

EVERY NIGHT.

I MEANT, DO YOU HAVE DREAMS?

ALL PEOPLE HAVE DREAMS,
SON.

EVEN THOSE DRUNKS
OVER THERE.

I DOUBT IT.

MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

[ CHUCKLES ]

HENRY...

WITH DREAMS COME HOPE.

AND IT'S HOPE THAT MAKES LIFE A
LITTLE EASIER TO FACE.

IN A WAY, WHEN YOU STOP
DREAMING,

YOU STOP HOPING.

AND WHEN YOU STOP HOPING,
YOU START DYING.

[ SIGHS ]
WHAT DO YOU DREAM ABOUT?

I DREAM...THAT YOU,
MY FRIEND,

WILL BE AS HAPPY
AS I HAVE BEEN.

WHAT'S THIS FOR?

THAT'S FOR YOU.

AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT,

YOUR DREAMS WILL ALWAYS
COME TRUE.

[ SIGHS ] THANKS.

Cindy: THE EVENING'S OVER.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO!

NOW, I'D BETTER GO HELP
THE LITTLE PRINCESS.

I WANT YOU AND YOUR BOYS
TO PACK UP AND GO.

YOU'RE MY LITTLE DARLING,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

YOU'RE THE LOUDEST PEOPLE
IN THE BAR.

WE'RE GONNA DANCE.

NO, WE'RE NOT.
I WANT YOU OUT.

I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A DANCE WITH YOU.

NOW, YOU KNOW --

COME ON, LET'S GO!
PACK IT UP.

NO! NO!

CECIL,
JUST LET ME HANDLE IT,

WILL YOU, PLEASE?

CECIL.

HEY! DON'T TOUCH ME!

DON'T EVER TOUCH ME!

[ GASPS ]

CECIL!

CECIL.

HENRY...
GET YOUR FATHER.

MOVE, DAMN IT! NOW!

SOMEBODY GIVE ME A BAR TOWEL.
COME ON!

DAD! DAD!

[ Crying ] SOMEONE STABBED CECIL
OVER AT THE CREST!

DAD! CECIL NEEDS YOU!
DAD! CECIL'S DYING!

[ PANTING ]

MY FRIEND...CECIL RUNNING BEAR'S
BEEN STABBED.

[ SNIFFS ]
HE NEEDS A DOCTOR.

[ SNIFFS ]

HENRY...

I...

YOUR FRIEND
GIVE YOU THAT?

IT'D HELP IF YOU HELD IT
FURTHER AWAY.

HUH?

THE BRACELET.

IF YOU WANT TO CATCH
A REFLECTION,

YOU HOLD IT FAR AWAY

AND THEN YOU BRING IT IN
CLOSER TO YOUR FACE.

HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

MISS WILDER CALLED.

CINDY.

CINDY CALLED.

AND SHE TOLD ME...
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND

MR. RUNNING BEAR.

I'M SORRY, HENRY.

[ SIGHS ]

SHE ALSO TOLD ME ABOUT
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.

NOTHING I DIDN'T KNOW
ALREADY.

SON...

NOT EVERYONE
IS GONNA SAY AND DO

EVERYTHING
YOU WANT THEM TO.

BUT PEOPLE --
MOST OF THEM --

THEY DO THEIR BEST
FOR WHO THEY ARE.

NOW, THEIR BEST
MAY NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH,

BUT IT'S THEIR BEST.

NO ONE SETS OUT
TO HURT ANOTHER PERSON.

[ SIGHS DEEPLY ]

BUT IT HAPPENS.

HE -- HE --
HE COULD HAVE SAVED HIM, MOM.

SON...

SOONER OR LATER...

YOU'RE GONNA HURT SOMEONE.

WE ALL DO.

AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT EVER
GONNA MEAN TO,

BUT YOU WILL.

[ Voice breaking ]
AND WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE,

AND YOU HURT SOMEONE
YOU LOVE,

ALL YOU'RE GONNA WANT
IS THEM TO FORGIVE YOU.

[ SNIFFLING ]

SO IF YOU'RE GONNA CRY,

YOU MAKE SURE
THAT YOU CRY FOR YOUR FRIEND,

'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE
NEEDS YOUR TEARS, HENRY.

THAT MISS WILDER --

[ SNIFFS ] SHE TOLD ME
HOW HARD YOU WORKED.

SHE SAID OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO EVER WORKED THERE,

MY SON WAS ONE OF THE BEST.

AND SHE THOUGHT
AND I THOUGHT

IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
FOR YOU TO GO BACK TO WORK.

SHE NEEDS YOU.

I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

THERE YOU GO, WILLIE.

I'M GONNA FINISH
MY INTERVIEWING.

HOW ARE THEY GOING?

ACTUALLY, KIND OF EASY.

NO WAY AM I EVER GONNA FIND
ANYBODY AS LAZY AS LYNETTE

OR AS GOOD AS CECIL.

BUT, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T HELP THINKING

NO MATTER WHO I HIRE,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE THE BEST,

BUT THEY ARE GONNA BE A LONG
WAY FROM BEING THE WORST.

ACTUALLY, I THINK WE
COULD USE

A LITTLE MIDDLE AROUND HERE.

I'LL BE OVER AT
THE BOOTH.

ALL RIGHT.

SORRY ABOUT CECIL.

I'M GONNA MISS HIM.

YEAH, ME TOO.

YOU, UH, EVER GET
THAT MUFFLER OFF?

NAH. I HAD TO CUT IT.

OH.

YOU SHOULD COME BY THE GARAGE.

I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO USE THE TORCH.

GREAT.

YEAH.

I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT.

IT'S A LITTLE SCARY AT FIRST
WHEN IT POPS AND ALL,

BUT, UH...

AFTER A LITTLE PRACTICE
YOU GET USED TO IT.

I START SCHOOL SOON.

OH, YEAH?

YEAH.

I'M GONNA BE GOING
TO SEVENTH GRADE.

GREAT.

Man: MA'AM.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

[ SIGHS ]

UH...THEY'RE HERE TO GET...
CECIL AND LYNETTE'S JOB.

CINDY'S INTERVIEWING.

HERE YOU ARE.

THANK YOU.

YEAH.

[ Sighing ] WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO JESSE?

[ SIGHS ]

WELL...

HE'LL GO TO PRISON.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

MY GUESS IS 25 TO LIFE...

WITH PAROLE AFTER 15.

YOU KNOW, IN A WAY,
HE'S KIND OF LUCKY.

IF CECIL WAS A WHITE MAN,
JESSE WOULD BE DEAD.

[ CHUCKLES ]

IT'S NOT FUNNY.

NO, KID --

HENRY --

IT'S NOT.

BUT I THINK CECIL WOULD HAVE
APPRECIATED THE IRONY OF IT.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

SEE...

JESSE'S A MAN WHO SPENT
HIS WHOLE LIFE HATING.

HE NEVER REALLY KNEW WHY.

HE WAS AFRAID...

BECAUSE HE WAS SURE THAT
ONE OF THE PEOPLE HE HATED

WAS GONNA TAKE HIS LIFE
AWAY.

I GUESS IN A WAY,
HE WAS RIGHT.

[ SIGHS ]

ME AND MY MOM
MIGHT BE MOVING.

OH?

YEAH.

MOM NEVER WAS REALLY HAPPY
HERE.

YOUR DAD AROUND?

YEAH, HE STILL LIVES
AT THE HOUSE,

IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

IT'S KIND OF SAD IN ONE WAY...
BUT OKAY IN ANOTHER.

OH.

HOW SO?

WELL, YOU SEE,

IT USED TO BE THAT MY MOM WOULD
NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR HERSELF,

NO MATTER WHAT.

IT SEEMED TO HER LIKE
IT WAS ONLY DAD THAT COUNTED.

[ TELEPHONE RINGING ]

BUT SINCE, UM...

YEAH.

WELL, NOW IT'S LIKE
MY MOM IS STRONG.

THE FUNNY THING IS,

SINCE THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE
BEEN TOGETHER,

YOU FINALLY KNOW WHO NEEDS WHO
AND WHO DOESN'T.

[ SCOFFS ]

HENRY.

THAT WAS YOUR FATHER
ON THE PHONE.

HE SAYS HIS CAR BROKE DOWN.

HE WANTED TO KNOW IF SOMEBODY
COULD GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME.

I SAID IT WOULD BE
NO PROBLEM.

PROBABLY GONNA CLOSE DOWN
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES ANYWAY.

YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

WHY NOT?
IT'S MY PLACE.

WELL, CINDY, PEOPLE DON'T COME
HERE 'CAUSE THEY'RE LOYAL.

THEY COME HERE TO DRINK.

YOU SHUT DOWN EARLY,
THEY'RE GONNA GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

I'LL TAKE HIM HOME.

THANKS.

THERE.

COME ON. LET'S GO.

[ SNIFFS ]

DO YOU THINK
THERE'S A HEAVEN?

YOU MEAN WITH CLOUDS
AND ANGELS?

YEAH.

NOPE.

I THINK THAT ONCE YOU DIE,
YOU DIE.

IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE ON,

IT'S ONLY GONNA BE
IN SOMEBODY'S HEART.

AS FAR AS DEATH GOES...

IT'S ONLY TOUGH
ON THE LIVING.

I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.

THAT'S OKAY.

YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT
NO ONE, DID YOU?

NO.

THANKS FOR TRYING,
THOUGH.

HEY, WATCH IT!

DAMN RABBITS!

[ SIGHS ]

YOU OKAY?

YEAH.

HEY, I SEE SOMETHING
UP THERE.

LOOKS TOO BIG
TO BE A RABBIT.

WHO IS IT?

THAT AIN'T NO RABBIT.

SURE AIN'T.

WELL, WHAT IS SHE DOING?

[ SIGHS ]

G-GETTING READY
TO BE SICK.

WE SHOULD GET HER HOME.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY STAY?

YEAH, OVER AT MAPES HOTEL
IN MINDEN.

I'LL GET HER IN THE TRUCK.

I CAN HANDLE IT.

[ MOANING ]

YOU TAKE IT EASY
THERE.

MY NAME'S J.M.
THIS IS MY TRUCK.

YOU NEED TO GET HOME.
IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET COLD.

WATCH OUT, NOW,
'CAUSE THIS IS A BIG STEP.

GET YOU IN HERE
SO YOU WON'T CATCH COLD.

ALL RIGHT.
HAVE YOU HOME IN A MINUTE.

[ CHUCKLING ]

YOU GONNA BE OKAY
THERE?

IF YOU GET TOO COLD
OR RUN INTO A PROBLEM...

GO AHEAD AND KNOCK
ON THE WINDOW.

I'LL PULL OVER.

OKAY.

<i>MY FRIEND CECIL ONCE SAID</i>
<i>THAT "EVERYONE DREAMS,</i>

<i>"AND WITH DREAMS COME HOPE,</i>

<i>AND IT'S HOPE THAT MAKES LIFE</i>
<i>A LITTLE EASIER."</i>

<i>AS I WATCHED THE MAN</i>
<i>AND THE WOMAN IN THE TRUCK,</i>

<i>I STARTED TO UNDERSTAND</i>
<i>WHAT CECIL MEANT.</i>

<i>FOR INSIDE THAT CAB,</i>

<i>IN THE MIDDLE</i>
<i>OF THE NEVADA DESERT,</i>

<i>APPEARED AN OASIS OF HOPE --</i>

<i>A PLACE WHERE A WOUNDED SOUL</i>

<i>COULD REST ON A COWBOY'S</i>
<i>SHOULDER</i>

<i>AND UNBURDEN HER WEARY HEART.</i>

<i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS SAID</i>
<i>THAT NIGHT.</i>

<i>J.M. NEVER TOLD ME.</i>

<i>BUT IF I HAD TO PUT MONEY</i>
<i>ON IT,</i>

<i>I'D BET THAT A TENDER HEART</i>

<i>HAD FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE</i>
<i>WHO'D LISTEN,</i>

<i>SOMEONE WHO'D MAKE IT ALL</i>
<i>BETTER,</i>

<i>SOMEONE WHO'D MAKE IT ALL</i>
<i>GO AWAY.</i>

<i>J.M. SAID THAT LIFE ISN'T LIKE</i>
<i>A FAIRY TALE</i>

<i>AND NOT ALL DREAMS</i>
<i>ARE MEANT TO COME TRUE.</i>

<i>I NEVER DID QUITE AGREE</i>
<i>WITH THAT.</i>

WE'RE HERE.

[ VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES ]

ALL RIGHT, HENRY.
