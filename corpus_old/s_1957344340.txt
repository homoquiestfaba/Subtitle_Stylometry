I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.

Air Force interest
in this problem

has been due to our feeling
of an obligation

to identify and analyze
to the best of our ability

<i>anything in the air</i>

<i>that may have the possibility
of threat</i>

<i>or menace to the United States.</i>

In pursuit of this obligation
since 1947,

<i>we have received and analyzed
between 1,000 and 2,000 reports</i>

that have come to us
from all kinds of sources.

We can say that
the recent sightings

<i>are in no way connected</i>

<i>with any secret development</i>

<i>by any department
of the United States.</i>

<i>Major Keyhoe,
as author of the book</i>

Flying Saucers Are Real,

<i>what is your opinion of these new
sightings of unidentified objects?</i>

With all due respect
to the Air Force,

I believe that some of them
will prove to be

of interplanetary origin.

During a three-year
investigation,

I found that many pilots

have described objects
of substance and high speed.

<i>One case, pilots reported
their plane was buffeted</i>

<i>by an object which passed
them at 500 miles an hour.</i>

Obviously, this was a solid object
and I believe it was from outer space.

[DISHES CLATTERING]
Dinner's ready.

I know your boyfriend.

Saw you with your boyfriend.

Wait, what night is it?

It's the boring chickpea
Tuesday night.

You girls be grateful now.

Did you know there's 168 million
child laborers in the world?

Some carry books on their head
all day

in 100 degree heat
for a can of chickpeas.

And they're considered
the lucky ones.

Is that true?

Momma says so.

God is great.

God is good.

Let us thank Him for our food.

By His hands we all are fed.

Give us Lord our daily bread.

<i>Look, Phoenix is a good team.</i>

<i>But the last three minutes
of the game,</i>

<i>they did it again.</i>

<i>This could have been
the game of the century.</i>

<i>I mean, they had it all.</i>

<i>I have a lot of respect
for David Quaid though.</i>

<i>I think he's made
a remarkable comeback.</i>

WOMAN: <i>Okay, I see what you're
saying, but I'll leave you with this.</i>

<i>They generate twice
as much revenue in sponsorship</i>

<i>than any other
NFL team out there.</i>

<i>All right, see you tomorrow.</i>

<i>Back to you, Marcus.</i>

<i>Now to a dire warning
about climate change.</i>

<i>According to a new report,</i>

<i>experts say that we have until
2030 to avoid catastrophe.</i>

<i>Report also says that if</i>

<i>unprecedented changes
aren't made soon,</i>

<i>there'll be dire consequences
for the planet.</i>

<i>The report focuses
on what could happen</i>

<i>if global temperatures rise by
2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

<i>CNN meteorologist Geoff Smith</i>

<i>is at the international
weather center.</i>

<i>Geoff, what can you tell us
about this serious warning?</i>

GEOFF: <i>Well, 2030, uh,
getting pretty close.</i>

<i>And, of course, we're seeing
that climate change</i>

<i>is already taking its toll
on the planet.</i>

<i>I mean, let's talk about
2016, '17, '18,</i>

<i>the three hottest years
on record.</i>

<i>During this time,
the polar ice caps</i>

<i>really started to melt...</i>

<i>Uh, I'm going to have to
interrupt you there, Geoff.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>We're getting breaking news
at this hour.</i>

<i>Breaking news
of a massive explosion</i>

<i>in the town of Badger,</i>

<i>which is a small community
of 1,300 people</i>

<i>in northern Pennsylvania.</i>

<i>There have been casualties,
many,</i>

<i>but the exact numbers
are not known at this stage</i>

<i>and the Pentagon
is yet to clarify</i>

<i>whether this has been
an act of terrorism</i>

<i>or a natural disaster.</i>

<i>Our reporter,
Samantha Bransgrove,</i>

<i>is on-site, live.</i>

<i>Samantha, what can you tell us
about this explosion?</i>

<i>Marcus, the entire town
has just dropped dead.</i>

<i>I repeat, nothing and no one</i>

<i>has survived
this mysterious explosion.</i>

<i>The town
is currently sealed off</i>

<i>and we're at least 50 miles
from ground zero.</i>

<i>The air around the town</i>

<i>is considered to be
highly toxic.</i>

<i>Now, as you can see behind me,</i>

<i>the entrance to the town
is heavily guarded</i>

<i>and no one is allowed in
without a hazmat suit.</i>

<i>Do we have any leads
at this stage</i>

<i>as to who or what could have
caused this explosion?</i>

<i>Marcus, unfortunately
at this point,</i>

<i>we have no solid leads.</i>

<i>There is, however,
a lot of speculation.</i>

<i>Some say that
it was a deadly explosion</i>

<i>from a chemical plant</i>

<i>that has contaminated
the entire town.</i>

<i>Others say
it was a chemical bomb.</i>

<i>The question is, Marcus,
if this was a chemical bomb,</i>

<i>why a small farming community?</i>

<i>If this really
was a terrorist attack,</i>

<i>why not a major city?</i>

<i>L.A., New York, Chicago.</i>

<i>We have no more information
at this stage, Marcus,</i>

<i>however, clearly,
something very devastating.</i>

MAN: Dr. Lauren Stone?

Yeah?

I'm Sergeant Clayton.

This is Sergeant Jones,
U S. Army.

You're coming with us, ma'am.

JONES: You've heard about
the explosion in Badger?

Yeah.

It's a matter
of national security.

You are urgently needed.

You must be mistaken.

JONES:
It's not a mistake, ma'am.

We're also authorized to use
excessive force if needed.

[SIREN BLARING]

[HELICOPTER HOVERING]

[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]

Colonel Roger Emmerich.

Lauren Stone.

I know who you are.

I've heard a lot about you.

Why am I here?

Follow me.

This is
Professor David Santiago,

astrobiologist.

Exobiologist Dr. Lauren Stone.

She works for NASA.

Geologists have confirmed
it's a meteorite,

estimated to be the size
of a basketball when it hit.

No one saw it coming.

A meteorite?

I know what you're thinking.

Meteorites don't release
toxic gas and kill people.

Well, this one did.

And it unleashed hell
within a 20-mile radius.

We managed to gather up

a few little pieces
here and there.

But it appears to have just hit

and dissolved into the soil.

No leads?

No.

No, all we know
is a space object

is responsible
for 373 innocent lives,

and no one can figure it out.

But whatever it is,
it's highly toxic,

it's airborne,

and you just
don't want to breathe it.

So, uh, why are we here?

We're dealing with something

we haven't dealt with before.

I just need you to get in,
do your thing,

and get out. And remember,

any information will be vital.

No more questions?

Yeah...
Good.

I need you to suit up.
Bus leaves in ten.

Lauren.

[INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING]

Do you know why I chose you?

Because I needed a believer.

I read your file.

They say
if it's out of this world,

you will find it.

Now something is buried
in there somewhere.

Oh, and...

...a sobriety test
will be conducted on you.

It's mandatory,
nothing personal.

[CAPTIVATING INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING]

I did read your book.

Found it pretty insightful,
actually.

I know you caught
some flak for it, but...

"Microbial Ecosystems
of the Antarctic."

Yeah, that bit about
morphological signatures

of extraterrestrial life...

...it's kind of like
when you read something

and it makes you
want to keep going.

Anyways...

These are my boys.

Sam and Michael.

Sam says to me, he says, uh...
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

he says, "Dad, when I grow up,

"I wanna follow
in your footsteps."

I say, "No."

You have to follow your own
passions, you know?

I say, "You're not gonna
follow my footsteps,

"you're gonna play ball."

Pretty good at baseball.

Then Michael... [CHUCKLES]

Michael says to me, says, "Dad,
why do you do what you do?"

I say,
"Don't you wanna find out

"if there's life
outside this planet?

"Aliens?

"Other species?"

He's like,
"No, I can live with that."

He pauses for a moment... Get this.
He pauses for a moment,

and I can see he's thinking something.
He looks at me,

right in my eyes,

deep into my soul,

and he says... he says, "Dad, why don't
you get a real job like Jason's dad?

"He's a plumber." [LAUGHS]

Anyways,

makes you wanna find
something even more, you know?

Just don't want to feel like
you're wasting your life.

What do you think?

[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
What do I think?

I think Michael was right.

Plumbing job doesn't sound
so bad right about now.

What the hell are we looking at?

There's nothing here.

Think I wish I had
a more form-fitting suit.

Really bunching up
in the nether bits, you know?

Think I just stepped in shit.

<i>"What are they trying to hide?"</i>

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

<i>Um, after that explosion,</i>

<i>some kind of chemical
was spread</i>

<i>and a lot of people died.</i>

INTERVIEWER: <i>Chemicals? Ask her where
is she getting her information from.</i>

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

<i>Kohler, the neighbor's son,</i>

<i>he's in army, so that's where
they get this information from.</i>

<i>The neighbor's son?
I see.</i>

<i>So why are they hiding it
from the rest of the world?</i>

<i>Can you ask her, most
importantly, what are they hiding?</i>

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

<i>Something else happen
after that explosion.</i>

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

<i>It was some kind of seed,</i>

following a massive chemical explosion...
Back off now!

However at 9:00 AM
Eastern Standard Time today,

these people rose
from the dead

and are now once again alive. They came...
They came back to life, Tom.

[REPORTERS CLAMORING]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

<i>Scientists and religious groups are
absolutely baffled by this event.</i>

<i>I heard various
commentary suggesting</i>

<i>that this could be an act
of evil or perhaps a miracle,</i>

<i>while some are trying to find
a scientific explanation</i>

<i>behind this
unprecedented event.</i>

<i>And this is unprecedented, Tom,
nobody knows why this happened</i>

<i>or why these people
have returned.</i>

<i>But the feeling is that they
must be here for a reason.</i>

Rough day, huh?

Look, can I get you something?

Look, I don't know what
happened out there today, but...

I'm on your side.

Just... let me know how I could help
you, all right?

I...

I just need a minute.

Yeah.
We're partners, right?

Look, you sure you don't
need something to drink?


Home.

An entire town

of 1,300 people drops dead.

49 of those victims
rise up from the dead.

Can someone
explain to me...

why them?

What happened to
the rest of the town?

We, uh...

We do have a theory, ma'am.

Enlighten me.

The 49 Badger victims
who were resurrected

resided in close proximity
of the initial explosion.

Now these victims didn't
just inhale the toxic air,

but they also swallowed a substance
which was spread from the explosion.

What kind of substance?

It's the...
the fragments of the meteorite

which resulted in transforming
their internal organs.

I guess you can say it's a
formation of a new life form

within the human body,
Governor.

The rest of the town died just
by breathing the toxic air.

In other words,

anyone who's exposed
to the air

in Badger today...
will die.

And nothing
can bring 'em back.


[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

By the way,
they seem to be doing that a lot.

Facing one
particular direction.

How you doing, kid?

You okay?

This is a repeated event.

Pardon me?

The meteorite or whatever
they're calling it.

How so?

February 15th, 2013.

There was a similar
explosion in Russia.

Chelyabinsk.
Yeah, Chelyabinsk, Russia.

I'm aware of it.

People died from similar symptoms,
but it didn't just end there.

Colonel...
I'm listening.


The Russians are hiding something.
You think it's the Russians?

No...

The Russians
were the victims.

Hm.

This wasn't an accident.

We were targeted.

That's a very
interesting theory.

Tell me, how did you
come up with this?

I found a report online.
Online?

The dark web.
Dark web?

Okay.

Colonel, I know
how it sounds.

Good.

They have no heartbeat,
no respiration,

no detectable signs
of any brain functionality.

They don't eat,
they don't sleep.

In other words,
they're as dead as Elvis.

No respiration,
no brain functionality, um...

Excuse me, Miss McKnight,
um...

what exactly
is moving them?

Well, Mr. President,
they most certainly appear to be dead.

I... I'm listening.

Blood and tissue
analysis have revealed

a number of compounds we're
still struggling to identify.

At a deeper level,
we've seen a wholesale breakdown

and a resequencing of DNA in
what used to be red blood cells.

Resequencing?

Yes, sir. A purposeful
resequencing.

This isn't some
random change.

The same new sequence is
repeated in each victim.

They're changing.

What the hell
does that actually mean?

We believe the DNA is being
deliberately modified

into an unknown DNA sequence.

An extraterrestrial sequence.

Aliens, General.

I say we put them down.

Problem solved.

Incinerate them.

I'm with the general.

I see.

Ms. Stone.

You clearly have
an opinion on all this.

Would you mind sharing
that with everyone?

Chelyabinsk, by a small village in the
Ural Mountains near the Kazakhstan border,

an almost identical meteorite strike
and reports of almost identical deaths

in a large area
surrounding the impact zone.

The world is aware
of the meteorite strike,

but the Russians kept
the remaining a secret.

They incinerated
an entire village.

My point exactly.

The Russians
made a smart move.

All I'm saying is this has happened
before, it may happen again.

We need to be
able to stop it.

We need answers.

First Chelyabinsk,
then Badger.

What's next?

Manhattan?
Population 1.6 million.

Do you have any other
evidence to support this?

Other than some video

on YouTube or a few images could
easily have been Photoshopped?

No, Mr. President.

Oh, boy.

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

WOMAN: <i>Is there even a point
in keeping these resurrected?</i>

<i>Any sign of any life or communication?</i>
Hey.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

Do you mind?
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

<i>...as to whether they should be
incinerated and put to rest or not.</i>

<i>The president has made an executive
decision to keep them a little longer,</i>

<i>and I believe that decision was made...</i>
Keep the change.

<i>...based on theory
by my colleague</i>

I didn't even cry.

<i>That's not normal.</i>

You're a good listener.

[PHONE VIBRATING]


[BREATHING HEAVILY]

Could just be the color red.

It's often used as
an expression of love,

or the opposite to symbolize
war, destruction.

It's the plant.

Someone in there needs
to be taken to this plant.

Why wasn't this plant reported?

It was just
a two-inch seedling.

Yeah.

Two-inch seedling.

Happens to grow in the middle
of a toxic impact crater

and wiped out an entire town.

Listen, this is a matter
of national security.

We're not sure what
we're dealing with here.

Call them zombies, aliens.

We don't know what
they're capable of.

We can't just take them there.

You know, Muslims,
when they pray,

they're commanded to face
a specific direction.

No matter where they are in the
world, they always face Mecca.

The holiest city to them.

DAVID: They're
all facing north.

So, what are you saying?

They're all Muslims?

I'm saying...

that we're here.

Now go north.

DAVID: Badger.

There's something there.


What?

What is it?

We found your seedling.

Colonel!

It's breaking news.

It's gone viral.

Follow me.

<i>Now, Tom, we're not sure
exactly what it is.</i>

<i>Whatever it is,
it's an unearthly beast</i>

<i>a mysterious giant
extraterrestrial phenomenon.</i>

<i>And it's still growing.</i>

<i>Susan, I'm just
a bit baffled in here.</i>

<i>I mean, how did a monstrous
object that size go unnoticed?</i>

<i>Were they trying to hide it?</i>

<i>Surely someone would
have noticed it at some point.</i>

<i>Now, Tom, as you're aware,
the town has been highly guarded.</i>

<i>It's been a no-go zone.</i>

<i>No one's been in or out
since the incident.</i>

<i>The scientists got what
they needed.</i>

<i>I believe the last two
who were on site</i>

<i>were astrobiologist Dr. David Santiago
and exobiologist Dr. Lauren Stone.</i>

<i>Nothing was seen or
reported by them.</i>

<i>So clearly, this thing did not
exist two days ago.</i>

<i>It's grown to this enormous
size in a short period of time,</i>

<i>and it's highly toxic.</i>

<i>You wouldn't be able to go
near it without a Hazmat suit,</i>

<i>and it's creating
its own atmosphere.</i>

<i>What was once speculated
to be a meteorite</i>

<i>is now confirmed to be a seed</i>

<i>that's resulted in
growing this phenomenon.</i>

<i>Now we're not sure
its purpose just yet.</i>

<i>But it's here for a reason.</i>

[HELICOPTER HOVERING]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

So that's your seedling, huh?

Don't get too attached to it.

Be shut down
before you know it.

COLONEL: As toxic as hell.

DAVID: You know...

part of me wants him to move.

Part of me doesn't.

Bet you 20 bucks
he ain't moving.

Make that 40.

You're on.
Count me in.

He ain't moving.

Shouldn't we be getting him
a blanket or something?

How about you get me a blanket?
Can't feel my goddamn toes.

What toes?

Exactly.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on. Damn it.


DAVID: He's moving.

Welcome to Earth.

I cannot go back with you.

I will not
survive your environment.

It has a reverse effect.

We cannot survive
the environment around it.

But just as our plants
here on Earth

provide oxygen for us,

it's life-giving for them.

Our closest neighboring star
is 4.2 light years away.

<i>How did they reach us out here?</i>

<i>There are reports of portals a few
tens of thousands of miles from Earth.</i>

<i>They're also
known as wormholes.</i>

<i>A wormhole is a tunnel
that creates a shortcut</i>

<i>for long journeys
across the universe.</i>

REPORTER 1: <i>Are you saying
that if these victims,</i>

<i>the resurrected, were taken
to this tree object,</i>

<i>they'd also communicate
or show signs of life?</i>

REPORTER 2: <i>Miss Stone, is it true that
you're on probation for DUI charges?</i>

REPORTER 3: <i>Did NASA know or
predict anything about this?</i>

<i>Surely someone would
have known something.</i>

and I asked you what you wanted
for your birthday.

You asked for a science lab.

Not a pony.

Not a bike or a Barbie doll.

But a lab.

We let you use the old shed.

Your passion,
your, your obsession

with science and space,

building projects...

Things got out of hand.

I...

guess your mom
got a bit worried.

How's things back home?

Things.

I guess lonely would be
about the right word.

I lost your mother.

And then I... lost you.

It's been hard, you know?

I've missed you.

Well...

it was good to see you.

It's refusing to talk to anyone
but you.

Uh, just give us a second.
Thank you.

It wants to talk to Lauren.

Homeland security,
all its bag of tricks,

all their techniques
couldn't make it budge.

It just wants to talk to you.

Seems it's found a friend
in you.

I see the feeling is mutual.

It won't be needing these.

This thing...

it's not like us.

It is not human.

You remember that.

I've prepared a list
of questions.

It's important you look at them.

I need you to find out
what it is,

where did it come from,

and most importantly,

<i>what does it want?</i>

Our home was no longer habitable
for our species.

We searched for a new home.

We found one.

Why Earth?

It doesn't grow anywhere else.

We were given the coordinates
to find this planet.

Coordinates?

By who?

One of your kind.

He calls himself

Supernova 94.

Supernova 94.

He searched for us.

He made contact with us.

We know your strengths.

We know your weaknesses.

Ask them to leave.

I can't do that.

They won't let it go on
much longer.

It's harming our environment.

Our home.

We will change your environment.

You cannot stop us.

We come from a hostile world.

We will not descend in peace.

We have abilities.

George?

George?

Do you hear me?

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

[OVERLAPPING CONVERSATION]

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
[GRUNTING]

Stop it!

Stop!

Son of a bitch!


Major Dean!
Goddamn it, Serge!

What are we doing?

It's all bullshit!
It's killing him.

God damn it, Serge, make the call.
Serge, come on!

Serge, make the fucking call!

This is bullshit!

Serge, what are you waiting for?

Shoot him.

[HIGH-PITCHED TONE]

[SOLDIERS SCREAMING]

WOMAN: What's happening to me?

Fuck!
Get him out of my head!

Stop it!

Stop it!

Get the fuck out of here!

No!
[GUNSHOT]

Approaching target.

WOMAN: Laser on.

Target is locked.

Light him up.

Copy that.
Three, two, one, rifle.

WOMAN: Captain, the missile
did not reach the target.

Something is blocking it.

Captain, we're losing him.

MAN ON RADIO: Copy...

MAN ON RADIO:
<i>The target still remains.</i>

<i>It has created a shield
around it.</i>

<i>I repeat,
the target still stands.</i>

<i>Permission to abort.</i>

<i>Return to base.</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

MAN ON TV: <i>We have unconfirmed
reports of shootings.</i>

<i>And we do not know if there's
any causalities at this stage.</i>

<i>And just when we thought things
couldn't get any worse,</i>

<i>we now have some reports that this thing
has apparently created a shield around it.</i>

<i>And no missiles
can get through it.</i>

WOMAN: <i>This is getting weird, and I
mean, it's getting really weird.</i>

<i>Tom, look, I really want to
talk about this Supernova guy.</i>

MAN: <i>Supernova 94.</i>

<i>Yeah, I mean, it sounds like
a user name, don't you think?</i>

MAN: <i>Yeah, an unusual
user name for a terrorist.</i>

WOMAN: <i>A terrorist?</i>
MAN: <i>A terrorist, a</i> desperado.

<i>Or call him a</i> jihadi.

<i>He's officially now
on the FBI's most wanted list.</i>

WOMAN: <i>So let me
get this straight.</i>

<i>We've been trying to intentionally
send signals into space</i>

<i>in search
of extraterrestrial life,</i>

<i>all the SETI missions and the
fancy telescopes, the golden disk,</i>

<i>but when an average Joe
makes contact with ET,</i>

<i>all of a sudden it's an act of terrorism.
This doesn't make sense.</i>

<i>I mean, shouldn't they be
giving this guy</i>

<i>a Nobel Prize
or something?</i>

MAN: <i>Now what
in the world is going on?</i>

<i>There have been a number
of cases of strange events</i>

<i>being reported
all around the world.</i>

<i>Let's start
with these weird sounds.</i>

<i>I invite you
to listen carefully</i>

<i>to the sounds
you're about to hear...</i>

<i>Not sure what it is.</i>

[OMINOUS WAILING]

I think,
I think the sky...

MAN: <i>So what exactly
is everyone hearing?</i>

<i>There have been
many theories, of course.</i>

Something...

[BREATHING HEAVILY]
Something really strange

is, is happening
here on my dad's,

my dad's property.

There's...
[OMINOUS INDISTINCT SPEECH]

these...</i>

<i>these noises</i>

<i>coming out of the woods.</i>

<i>Last night, we could,
we could feel the ground shake.</i>

FEMALE REPORTER: <i>We've just received
some reports of a mysterious fog</i>

<i>or some call it
a thick smoke</i>

<i>that's just appearing out of nowhere and killing people.</i>
[CLAMORING]

REPORTER:
<i>Reports of many explosions</i>

<i>in the city
of Bangalore, India.</i>

<i>Officials are saying</i>

<i>there's been
mass casualties</i>

<i>with bodies everywhere.</i>

The Governor ordered shutting
down all non-essential businesses

and telling people
to remain in their homes.

MALE REPORTER: <i>Millions of people
have gathered around the world</i>

<i>and held mass prayer.</i>

<i>Martial Law has been declared</i>

<i>as the military
take control</i>

<i>of all civilian governments.</i>

I think, I think
they're already here.

That Supernova guy
works for NASA.

[MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

<i>The ground has been shaking.</i>

<i>All the crops are dying,</i>

<i>This all happened overnight.</i>

<i>There's something wrong
with the soil.</i>

<i>Let me show you
something.</i>

<i>See? It's all rotten.</i>

I can actually feel
the ground vibrating.

Do you feel that?
Yeah.

We're on the edge

of a mass...
[MEN CLAMORING]

extinction.

[TRAIN HORN BLARING]

LAUREN: <i>Who am I?</i>

<i>What am I?</i>

<i>Do you ever feel like
you're suffocating</i>

<i>and want to crawl
out of your skin?</i>

<i>But you're trapped
in your own body</i>

<i>like you're abandoned</i>

<i>and you don't belong
anywhere.</i>

<i>The world is coming
to an end</i>

<i>but why is it that I'm feeling
a sense of relief?</i>

<i>Like I'm...</i>

<i>I'm finally being
put out of my misery,</i>

<i>like I can finally breathe.</i>

<i>All the suffering.</i>

<i>I used to think
my answers</i>

<i>lay somewhere
in distant space</i>

<i>among the stars.</i>

<i>But for the first time</i>

<i>I feel that the truth</i>

<i>is finally within
my reach.</i>

<i>Right here.</i>

It looks different.

She is...

going through a process.


[MUFFLED BREATHING]

What's happening?

It's time.

[INDISTINCT DISTINCT CHATTER]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

It's life...

growing.

Beautiful, isn't it?

[MUFFLED INDISTINCT CHATTER]

How is this even possible?

You made it possible.

She was our only hope.

Our only proof of existence.

She was our last chance.

You fought for her.

You were involved
in an incident.

You don't remember anything?

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

Daddy,
where are we going?

We're going someplace secret.

Now I need you
to be a good girl

and don't tell anyone,

I mean nobody,

about our secret place.

Not even Mommy, okay?
Okay.

I love you, honey.

Tell me more about it.

MAN: It was captured and killed

early this morning

at 0400 hours
in Northern Alaska, sir.

An unidentified flying object

was reported
by the locals.

I see.

WOMAN: Welcome
to Area 51, Senator.

Now, you need to wait
out here, sweetheart.

Okay?

I'll be back in a minute.

I love you.

[MEN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY]

[CHATTER CONTINUES]

[CHATTER CONTINUES]

MAN: My God,
it's a beast.

You sure it's...
WOMAN: Dead as a doornail, sir.

MAN 2: It seemed that it was
trying to plant something.

It was incredibly strong,
hostile but highly intelligent

with a high-tech spaceship
and advanced weapons.

WOMAN: Thanks
to the Earth's atmosphere,

it appears they haven't
adapted to our environment,

which slowed it down, sir.

MAN: Oh, and they have
an ability to fly, sir.


MAN: <i>Our home was no longer
habitable for our species.</i>

WOMAN: Hey! Get up!

God damn it, kid, you're not
supposed to be in here.

MAN: Where was she?

WOMAN:
She was in the bathroom, sir.

[CAPTIVATING INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING]

My God, what is that?

Is that...
It's a blueprint.

Looks like a rocket.

She's eight years old
for God's sake.

What kind of school...

I don't think
it's a school project.

She seems to be
showing an interest in science

and the extraterrestrial life.

<i>She's also becoming
more isolated.</i>

<i>She has this ability
to manipulate</i>

not just the students
but also some of the teachers.

<i>She also says that
she's an alien</i>

<i>and she wants to go home.</i>

Hello?

[ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING]

Is anyone there? This is...

This is Supernova 94.

Do you copy?

[ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING]

You said
she was building a rocket.

Who have you been talking to?

There are some bad people
out there. You hear me, Lauren?

I need you to put a lock
on this thing.

That's it.

You are not allowed
in the shed anymore, missy.


<i>God damn it!
What is wrong with you?</i>

<i>What have I told you about
painting on the walls?</i>

You will die

<i>a most horrible death.</i>

<i>We have abilities.</i>

MAN: <i>Senator,</i>

<i>we found a mysterious
new form of DNA</i>

<i>in Lauren's blood cells.</i>

<i>We can't really figure it out.</i>

<i>She's changing
into something else.</i>

<i>It's like she's half-human
and becoming...</i>

SENATOR: <i>Shh, you might want to
keep your voice down, Doc.</i>

<i>I know she's in the other room,</i>

<i>but she can hear
through the walls.</i>


Welcome home.


[ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING]

...a space composed
that's 78.09% nitrogen,

20.95% oxygen,

0.93% argon,

and 0.04% carbon dioxide,

and a small amount
of other gases.

MAN: <i>Who is this?</i>

Kid, can you hear me?

<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

JACK: <i>Ask her her name.</i>

This is the goddamn CIA.

She called herself Supernova 94.

What the hell is Super...
I don't know, Jack.

JACK: <i>We're trying to decode</i>

<i>sensitive
military operations here.</i>

WOMAN: <i>Strange objects
are appearing around the world.</i>

<i>What began in Indiana
and Alberta, Canada,</i>

<i>has now occurred in several
places across the globe,</i>

<i>including Australia
and Greenland.</i>

<i>They're appearing everywhere,
in forests,</i>

<i>the Sahara Desert, farms,
lakes, major cities.</i>

<i>They are everywhere.</i>

MAN: <i>Well, I've seen on TV
and a lot of video</i>

<i>that has been shown to me,
it's the shape of an egg.</i>

REPORTER: <i>The strange noises
once reported are now confirmed</i>

<i>to be coming out of these
mysterious egg-shaped objects.</i>

<i>There many wild theories.</i>

<i>Some say they arose
from the ground,</i>

<i>while others say they were
placed there overnight</i>

<i>by a giant alien spacecraft.
It's crazy.</i>

MAN 1: <i>This could be an act
of alien invasion on...</i>

MAN 2: <i>We don't understand
what it is.</i>

MAN 3: <i>I mean, this is it.
They're here.</i>

<i>They're inside those pods</i>

<i>and they're ready to come out
any second now.</i>

<i>They've risen.</i>

MAN:
<i>I guess the big question is</i>

<i>how will they survive
Earth's environment.</i>


[ALARM BLARING]

MAN 2: <i>It's like doomsday as they
call it in the Bible or Koran...</i>

WOMAN: <i>I haven't
really seen it,</i>

<i>but those who've seen it
from a distance</i>

<i>describe it as a wave
of this energy or smoke</i>

<i>that's just bursting through
the towns and killing people.</i>

<i>It's actually
very heart wrenching</i>

<i>because you know
a lot of these people</i>

<i>didn't get a chance to evacuate
when this happened.</i>

They're creating a habitable
environment for themselves

<i>before they pop out.</i>

Where do they come from?


<i>are connected to these roots.</i>

They contaminated the soil.

They were growing
right beneath us.

But the main question
still remains.

<i>Where did these roots
come from?</i>

LAUREN: <i>Earth no longer supports
life for the human species.</i>

<i>The planet has transformed</i>

<i>and an evolution has begun.</i>

<i>There was nowhere to run</i>

<i>and nowhere to hide.</i>

<i>All earthly species
and plants became extinct.</i>

<i>Nothing survived.</i>
It's been six months

since the invasion.
I'm on my last oxygen tank.

I don't want to die.

[ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING]


<i>It's a different world
out here now.</i>

<i>As for me,</i>

<i>my journey
finally came to an end.</i>

<i>I'm finally home.</i>
