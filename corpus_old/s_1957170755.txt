YOU JUST WANT THE HEAD ?YEAH, YOU KNOW,
JUST THE HEAD ON THE STAND.

YOU CAN DO THEIR HAIR

JUST THE BUST.

THEY HAVE THE WHITE ONE,
WHICH I ALREADY HAVE,
BUT NO BLACK ONE.

MAYBE THEY'LL ORDER ONE.I WANT THE STORE TO HAVE IT.
THEY SHOULD HAVE IT.

THEY PROBABLY DON'T THINK
ANYONE WOULD WANT ONE.

THERE'S NOT THAT MANY
BLACK PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

THERE ARE BLACK PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE AROUND HERE.

THEY'RE JUST TOO FUCKING STUPID
AND RACIST TO ORDER THEM.

YEAH, THEY ARE RACIST.

THEY ALSO PROBABLY THINK
THAT IF THEY DID HAVE
BLACK BOBBIE HEADS,

THEY'D REALLY STAND OUT
AND LOOK REALLY RACIST...

BECAUSE THEY'D BE
THE ONLY BLACK THINGS
IN THE STORE.

WHATEVER. COME WITH ME.
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

I LIKE YOUR CAR.
IT LOOKS LIKE AN UNDERCOVER
POLICE CAR, I THINK.

WELL, YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IT USED TO BE A REGULAR
POLICE CAR,

BUT I GUESS IT IS LIKE
AN UNDERCOVER ONE NOW.

IT'S LIKE THE ONES
YOU SEE WAITING AT THE LIGHT.

THEY GET IMPATIENT,
FLIP THE SIREN,
THEN DRIVE RIGHT THROUGH,

WHICH TOTALLY BLOWS

IT'S NOT LIKE THEIR COVER
ISN'T BLOWN AWAY.

I'M FINE, I'M FINE,
I'M FINE.

WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT, BITCH ?

I'M FINE.GET IN.

[ Marcy ] AT THIS TIME, NOBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS YET.

I COULDN'T EVEN GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT CAUSING A TOTAL RIOT.

I'D SPEND MOST OF THE DAY
INCREDIBLY-- NOISILY--

MAKING SURE MY CHAIR WAS
EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROOM...

FROM EVERY ANGLE
AND PERSPECTIVE POSSIBLE.

WHAT ?IT IS OKAY THAT I USED
YOUR TOOTHBRUSH, ISN'T IT ?

MM-HMM.THANKS.

WHEN I GOT THE CHAIR THERE,
IT WOULDN'T COUNT...

UNLESS I TAPPED THIS AMAZING
DRUMROLL ON THE BACK OF
THE GIRL-IN-FRONT-OF-ME'S HEAD.

WHICH, OF COURSE,
WOULD MAKE HER CONSTANTLY
FREAK OUT AND COMPLAIN.

HM, HM, HM, HM,
HM, HM, HM, HM.

ALL THE KIDS I WENT
TO GRAMMAR SCHOOL WITH HAD THESE
FUCKED-UP NICKNAMES FOR ME.

CALLED ME "MENTAL MARCY"
AND "SPAZZY" AND "TWITCHY."

SO, FINALLY, MY DAD TOOK ME
TO THIS DOCTOR IN SYRACUSE...

WHO SAID I WAS
A BIOPSYCHOSOCIOPATH...

AND THAT I HAD
TOURETTE'S SYNDROME.

SOUNDS AWFUL.
SOUNDS LIKE A REAL DRAG. [ Bottles Clinking ]

IT'S NOT, REALLY.
I MEAN--

NOW IT'S JUST
KIND OF PART OF WHO I AM.
I'M USED TO IT.

ALL THE TOUCHING AND SHOUTING
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

IT SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF PEOPLE
'CAUSE EVERYBODY WHO HAS
TOURETTE DOES DIFFERENT THINGS.

I HAVE, UH, LIKE, THE--
I HAVE THESE MUSCLE TICS.

LIKE TENSING UP
AND MY HEAD GOES BACK.

I ALSO HAVE THIS THING
CALLED ECHOLALIA,

WHICH IS WHEN YOU HAVE
TO REPEAT THE SAME WORD
OVER AND OVER...

UNTIL YOU FEEL LIKE,
IN YOUR THROAT, THAT--

ACTUALLY, IT'S LIKE I HAVE THIS ITCH INSIDE OF ME, AND IF I DON'T TIC...

OR SAY THE WORD EXACTLY
THE WAY I NEED TO SAY IT,

I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA FUCKING EXPLODE. REALLY ?

YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANNA DO THIS STUFF.
I-- I HAVE TO.

SO, MOST OF THE TIME,
I JUST DRINK A LOT BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT HELPS THE MOST.

WELL, DOESN'T
ANYTHING ELSE HELP ?

SEX HELPS.

FOR SOME REASON,
SEX HELPS.

UM, SO THAT WAS--

THAT WAS, LIKE,
AN ATTACK,

WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE
WITH THOSE GUYS
IN THE PARKING LOT ?

WE WERE HANGING OUT TOGETHER
ALL DAY LONG,

AND I WAS TRYING TO HOLD IN
MY TICS 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ME DO IT.

I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SCARE YOU
OR ANYTHING.

AND SO, I-- I HELD THEM IN
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

AND WHEN THOSE GUYS
STARTED FUCKING WITH YOU,
I JUST KIND OF FLIPPED OUT.

I'M SORRY.

THAT STUFF'S CALLED
AGGRESSIVE EXPLOSIVE BEHAVIOR.

I DO THAT SHIT ALL THE TIME.

NOT ALL THE TIME,
BUT SOMETIMES I DO IT.

RARELY, I DO IT.

ARE-- ARE YOU OKAY
AND EVERYTHING ?

DO YOU WANT ME TO GO GET YOU
A SOUP OR SOMETHING ?

I CAN'T HELP IT.
THAT'S ALL.

I HAVEN'T NOTICED
ANYTHING AT ALL.

THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE
I'M REALLY GOOD AT MAKING IT
LOOK NORMAL.

LIKE, I INCORPORATE MY TICS
INTO SOMETHING NATURAL.

LIKE, I'LL--
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I DO.

OR I'LL GO LIKE THAT
AND I'LL FIX MY HAIR.
I DID THAT TO YOU, RIGHT ?

YEAH.

ALSO, HALDOL.
THAT'S THE MEDICATION
THAT I TAKE FOR IT. THAT HELPS.

IT DIDN'T MAKE MY TICS
GO AWAY.

IT MADE ME HAVE THEM LESS
THAN I USUALLY WOULD.

SO, DOES IT FREAK YOU OUT ?

NO, NOT AT ALL.GOOD.

[ Grunts ]

SO, UH, WHAT WAS THAT
THAT YOU TOOK BACK
AT THE LIQUOR STORE ?

I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.OH, YOU DIDN'T ?

[ Chuckling ]
YES, YOU DID.

I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY SAW THAT. WELL.

[ Chuckling ]WHAT IS IT ?

I'M NOT AS SMOOTH

IF WE HAVE A BABY,
WE HAVE TO NAME HIM
SETH, JUNIOR.

OKAY, BUT IF WE HAVE

I AM DOUG.

WELL, LISTEN, DOUG,

THEY KNOCKED OUT
A LOT OF HIS TEETH.
