ï»¿1
Of Sarah and Nick who, sadly,
will be leaving us

for Missouri tomorrow.

: Boo!

Yeah.

: Boo.

Don't go.

But, fortunately for them,
Missouri loves company.

Oh, come on, you don't like
that one?

I worked on it all last night.

Anyway...

Are there even any
health food stores out there?

No, but I am gonna
be able to start that garden

I always wanted and our food
source will be

completely sustainable.

Bravo, Sarah.

Oh, my God, guys, I'm like,
so proud of you, seriously.

You're on the forefront.

You're like in the battle
against our energy crisis,

and we need people like you,
out there figuring stuff out,

you know.

Building wind farms, or ethanol
crops, whatever it is

you have to do.

You know, you have to solve
the problems.

It's important for the future
and it takes a lot of courage

and I'm all for it.

What about the kids there,
are you gonna... are

you gonna keep trying for that?

Oh, definitely, but the
doctor said that maybe a change

of scenery would help.

So...

You know, I think maybe he
just meant like try doing it on

the living room floor or
something.

I don't think he meant, like,
you have to go to Missouri.

Yeah, he probably he did, but
oh well.

So, this should really help.

Everything okay with you?

You all right?

Yeah.

I mean, is there anything
that you want... that

you want to talk about maybe?

No.

No? Not...

No.

Some of you may know this,
but our Nick here is gonna

be working in one of the largest
windmill parks

in all of America.

So, in honor of your journey I
wanted to present you guys

with these little parting gifts.

Oh nice.
Look at those.

Oh, my God, look is this?

Spin 'em! Spin 'em!

Here's to going
where the wind blows you.

Bill?

Nick.

Nice to meet you.

Hi, I'm Sarah.

Nice to meet you.

So, are we still in Nebraska,
Bill?

Yep.

We'll be in Rock Port in about
an hour.

Then we'll head on down to the
cabin in Hoot Owl Bend.

So, you're from Rock Port
originally, Bill?

Yep, born and raised.

I went to school in Manhattan
though.

Hmm.

Wow, that must've been a
culture shock.

Not really.

Manhattan's in Kansas.

It's about an hour across the
Missouri border.

Oh.

I thought you were talking
about the other Manhattan.

That's funny.

Yeah.

Manhattan, Kansas is,
however, the home to longest

continually operating Pizza Hut
store in the United States.

Well, here she is.

Oh, by the way, I got you my
cousin's truck to drive until

you get a different one.

Thanks.

That there is the Missouri
River.

Well, you wanted something
cheap, cheap it is.

I ain't done much with it since
the old man passed.

You know, we used to come down
here spring and summers for the

fishin'.

Well, you got your bed over
here.

You got your kitchen area over
here, stove and whatnot.

So, what do you think?

It's nice.

Yeah, it's... it's great.

Where's the bathroom?

Well now, as far as the
garden you wanted to plant

around here,
it's probably not a good idea to

put it back here.

Yeah, this place is pretty well
saturated.

Nice little spot around front
though.

They say there's a bald eagle's
nest over here someplace.

They say seein' one's good luck.

I never seen one myself.

All right, this covers you
for the first month's rent and

the pickup.

I'll see you tomorrow at the
office.

Hey.

Hey.

You all right?

There's no bathroom.

Ah, it's only temporary, baby.

You know, just think of it as a
wonderful camping trip, just you

and me.

You know, you don't go
camping for more than two or

three days at a time, okay?

People who camp for extended
periods are called "hobos."

No, we're not hobos.

We are a very, very lucky
people.

I mean, look, it's beautiful.

I know.

All right, Nick.

I got your test results here,
and I'd like to explain a little

bit about what they mean.

You can see these sperm cells
are irregular, or abnormal.

Basically, these cells are
incapable of fertilizing an egg.

Is there anything I can
do to fix it?

To be quite honest with you,
Nick, no.

Rock Port is the
first town in the.

United States to derive
100% of its energy

from wind power.

We have five competing wind
energy companies in the area,

but we are the biggest.

We currently share this office
space with Trade Wind Energy.

Now, if you'll look at the map
you'll see that we have about

100,000 acres on our property.

We do have two farms that are
closer to completion

than the rest.

One of them is near the Missouri
River and then the other one is

in Fairfax, Missouri.

We have a lot of landowners who
have expressed an interest, but

we haven't quite brought
them on board.

We're hoping that with all the
activity, and the benefits, and

the community involvement that
they'll be on board soon.

So, do you have any questions,
Nick?

Uh, no.

Okay, then.

Welcome to the Anamway Energy
Family.

Thank you.

Wow, these things
look so much bigger down

on the ground.

Yeah, and that's just
one blade.

Any drawbacks to these things?

None that I've seen.

Some people don't like the looks
of 'em.

My old man worked in a coal
refinery all his life.

These things are a hell of a lot
prettier than that.

You know, being out
here makes me feel like a little

kid again.

The fresh air, and rolling
around in the grass, grass

stains.

Ugh, grass stains.

I used to get in so much trouble
when I was a little kid.

You know, I would come home with
them all over my pants.

My mom would want to kill me.

Oh, and burdocks.

Burdocks?

What are burdocks?

You don't know about burdocks?

No.

Um, they're these awful
little dried up plants, like

thistles, and my sister and I
would get them all in our hair

and we'd have to spend the rest
of the day picking them out.

It was a nightmare.

Oh, baby, this would be a
wonderful place to raise kids.

I got two people in the
office, but it doesn't matter to

me because I don't have to
report to an office ever again.

Basically, what I do is I go
from farm to farm and I meet

with different farmers and I
make sure that they're happy.

Uh... is everything okay?

Yeah, it's just that there's
this guy over at the bar who

keeps staring at me.

Don't... stop, don't turn around.

He's creeping me out.

Everybody's looking at us,
baby.

Here you go.

Today's the big day.

Are we going in?

Nah.

I got a call from Darius
Clemens, the farmer that owns

this land.

This unit went up about a week
ago and the workers left some

pop cans and stuff layin' around
here.

So, what we're gonna do...
is clean it up.

So, how'd you get into this
line of work?

Just the right place, the
right time, I guess.

â™ª Just one
thing, I don't know what I'm

fightin' â™ªâ™ª - Hey, try these.

Turn around.

Mm, it's too baggy in the butt.

You know, nobody's
looking at my butt when I'm

pickin' up garbage.

Bingo!

That's one good bingo!

Damn, I was in.

Darius owns half the county.

He's even got his own Mexicans.

Bill, what's the good word?

Nothin' much.

Thanks for cleaning up my
ground over by turbine 27.

Oh, not a problem, Darius.

I just wanted to swing by and
introduce you to Nick.

He's going to be taking over for
me when Lana goes to Kansas.

City.

Darius Clemens, good to meet
you.

Good meeting you.

Say, did I see you out to The
Black Iron the other night

with a lovely young lady?

Yes, that was my wife.

I thought so.

We don't see a lot of new faces
around here.

So, when you do see one
it really pops out

and you remember it.

So, where's Bill got you
stayin', Nick?

Hoot Owl Bend.

You got him stayin' out to
your dad's old cabin?

Yep.

You know, my mom she used to
call that place,

"The Sugar Shanty."

She never went out there because
she said that she wasn't givin'

out any sugar.

How 'bout you two comin' up here
tomorrow night for dinner, bring

your better halves.

I'd love to, Darius, but I
got bingo tomorrow night.

Well, good luck with that.

Thanks.

How about you, Nick?

You want to bring your better
half up here and have dinner

about six o'clock tomorrow
night?

Absolutely. I'd love to.

Good.

I'll see you then.

That's some place he's got.

Yeah, you should see his wife.

So, how do I look?

Great, babe.

You're not even looking.

What else do you got?

Jesus, Nick, you bought me
this dress.

A gift certificate, baby.

You picked it out.

After last week's evening out
I don't know what to expect.

There it is.

What?

The best look I've seen on
you all evening.

So, you're saying you only
think I look pretty when my tits

are hanging out.

Darius Clemens thinks you're
very hot.

Really?

I think you're really hot.

Welcome! Glad you could make
it up to my neck of the woods.

Oh, thanks for inviting us.

Darius Clemens.

Good to meet you.

I'm Sarah.

Nick, you've got yourself one
beautiful lady here.

Come on, let me show you two
around.

When I bought this ground it was
nothin' but bluff ten years ago.

Now look at it.

It's amazing.

My own little kingdom up here.

Right here, as you can see, are
some of my turbines.

Anamway pays me $15,000 per year
per turbine.

That increases yearly with
profit sharing.

Pretty good money to just sit on
my ground and spin.

Maybe Bill should tear down that
cabin at Hoot Owl Bend and put

him up a turbine.

Darius!

Right here's the
best thing on the place, my

lovely wife, Madeline.

Most of the corn we grow is not
really for human consumption.

It's for ethanol gasoline, seed
corn, livestock feed, a little

bit of popcorn here and there.

Oh, that's amazing.

I got that out in Wyoming
about five years ago.

It's a big deer.

Elk.

Near perfect except for a slight
irregularity on the right

antler.

It's still a beautiful animal
though.

Oh, you must be quite the
hunter.

Not a hunter, more of a
collector.

He picked that up at an antiques
show a couple years back.

So, have you been to Rock
Port yet?

No, um, I've sort of been
stranded out at Hoot Owl Bend.

Well, you must be goin' stir
crazy.

Well, tomorrow's Saturday,
are you doing anything?

Why don't I take you to town?

Oh, I'm not sure.

It's just that tomorrow is
Nick's day off and I don't want

to leave him all by himself.

I'm taking him up north to
show him some ground I have up

there.

Good, it's decided.

Two things Missouri's
famous for: Sellin' fireworks

and meth.

My cousin owns that farm right
up there.

My mom grew up on that farm
right down there behind those

trees.

There was a old lady we bought
eggs from who lived here.

Eggs were 20 cents a dozen, and
when you'd buy the eggs they had

shit and feathers on the egg.

You just washed them eggs and... I
mean, the shit still stayed

on 'em.

A lot of these places went broke
during the farming crisis of the

'80s.

So, now we have these rusted out
shitholes everywhere.

It's sad.

I remember it a different way
from when I was a little boy.

Fortunately, wind turbines mean
money, you know, for a lot of

these farmers.

Rain or shine, crop or no crop,
they always have an income.

How long have you and Nick
been married?

Um, it'll be four years this
June.

So, you two thinkin' of
startin' a family soon?

Rock Port's the place to do it.

Yeah, well, actually, um,
we've been workin' on that for a

while now, and it just hasn't
been as easy as we expected.

Maybe the fresh country air
will help.

Yeah, well, that's what we're
hoping.

When I was a kid I
couldn't wait to get out of this

town.

But as I've gotten older, maybe
wiser, I've come to realize it's

not such a bad place to live.

And as far as being dead you
can't get any better.

I love this place.

Yeah.

I wouldn't mind being buried
here myself.

I'm sorry, my friend, it is
all booked up.

I've had my reservation since
before I was born.

Meet my dad, Darius Clemens, Sr.

Were you close to him?

No.

He was an old prick.

Hmph.

He was a good businessman,
though.

They never stop staring.

Why do they do that?

Because we're outsiders.

And by outsiders I mean we
weren't born in Rock Port.

Oh, everyone I've met so far
has been really nice.

Oh, they're nice to your
face, but the minute you turn

around they're nasty gossips.

I've heard rumors spread
about myself and others.

They're not worth repeating.

You're up.

Nah, here.

Come on, you gotta... you
gotta line your sights up there.

Okay?

Yeah.

Yeah.

My dad put that grain Quonset
in one year as a father's day

present.

It's big.

Yep.

It's all about braggin' rights.

The bigger it is the more there
is to brag about, the more they

respect you.

It's the same thing in New
York City.

It's all about the square
footage of your apartment, the

size of your bank account.

Yeah, but you don't strike me
as the kind of person who's

concerned with that sort of
thing.

Nah, not really.

I don't need much to survive.

So, you came out here to good
old Rock Port to lead the simple

life.

I guess you could say that.

That's a good dream, but your
wife's gonna beat it out of you

eventually.

Thank you.

My life is based on what I
own, my ground.

Without owning land out here the
best you can hope for is to farm

someone else's or drive an hour
to work in a factory somewhere.

That'd kill me.

Let's get out of here!

Do you think Madeline's pretty?

She's okay.

Just okay?

She's attractive enough, I
guess.

Do you think I'm attractive
enough?

Of course, babe.

Why?

Nick, this is a really good
time for me.

Getting you pregnant is just
not first on my priority list

right now.

It should be our first
priority!

I'm sorry, babe.

I didn't mean that.

I just thought that coming
here might help, you know?

A change of scenery, we'd be
more relaxed, but I'm scared,

Nick.

What if I can't?

Of course you can.

Do you promise, promise we
can try?

I promise.

So, Bill told me you
were up here.

I thought you might be able to
use a beer.

Thanks, Darius.

So, how's Anamway?

No complaints.

How's the pay?

That could be better.

Nick, if you don't mind me
asking, just what are you tryin'

to do there?

Well, I'd like to move up in
the company.

Eventually get into planning.

You talk to Bill about that?

Nah.

Not yet.

Bill's a man of few words.

You might wanna pin him down,
get some answers.

Thanks, hon.

So, Bill, I've been doing a
little bit of thinking, and I

think I'm ready to move on.

Ready to quit already?

No, move on to the next phase
of my job with Anamway.

Well, you're doing the job I
trained you for right now.

I haven't even been inside of
a turbine yet.

And you may not.

The only people we let up there
are engineers.

Okay, when I took this job
they said that I could move up

the company.

Well, if you want to relocate
to Kansas City...

Kansas City?

If you want to relocate to
Kansas City, you can take some

training classes, and get on the
maintenance side, which would

be oiling the turbines and
getting the grease out of the

main shaft, but either way you
look at it, Nick, you're

cleaning up the inside or you're
cleaning up the outside.

What is this?

It's cereal.

I know what it is.

We don't have any milk?

No, Nick, we don't have milk.

In case you forgot, I don't have
a car, and you haven't gotten

groceries in three days, except
for beer, of course.

That's disgusting.

It's not that bad.

First, you start pissing out
our window, and now this?

I'm not going out to that
shit house at 2 a.m. to take a

piss.

You're destroying my garden.

Don't walk away from me, Nick!

So, how you like the
local cuisine?

It's great.

Well, it's not gourmet, but
it does the trick.

So, I thought this place was
only supposed to be temporary.

It is.

I'm working with Anamway to get
something better soon.

Is everything all right, Nick?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Listen, I don't want to
overstep my boundaries, but I've

been thinkin' about what we
talked about.

There's something I want to tell
you.

I think you're wasting
your time at Anamway.

Well, I...
Look, just hear me out.

I know you came out here on a
mission and I commend you, but

sometimes things don't work out
the way you planned, trust me.

I've got a lot of experience
with that.

The bottom line is you've got
your wife stranded out here for

a month?

Now, you don't want her to go on
like that, do you?

No.

I want you to come and work
for me.

I have a few side jobs I can
give you.

Darius, I'm not lookin' for
charity.

Listen, I don't do charity.

I'm just as shrewd as my dad,
maybe twice as mean.

Just think about it.

If you want me you know where
to find me.

Darius is over in
Brownville evicting someone.

Yikes.

You know Darius, he's all
business.

Yeah, that's actually what
I'm here to talk to him about.

He should be back in a minute.

This is really good.

It's actually the best breakfast
I've had in a while.

Sarah's not much of a cook?

Um, she's not much of a
morning person.

That's a shame.

I think morning's the best time
for men and women.

Juice?

Um, no, I'm fine.

Well, look who's here.

Now, Nick, as you know I
own a lot of ground in this

county.

Most of what I do on a daily
basis is keep an eye on that

ground, make sure everything is
in good repair, rents are paid

on time.

Now, I can pay pretty good,
Nick, but what I need from you

is a guarantee that what happens
between us stays between us.

I don't like just anyone knowing
my business.

Of course.

Good.

Now, our first order of business
today is to go out and get a

beer.

Hi there.

Hi.

Did I wake you up?

Oh, no, I was up.

I brought you some flowers
for your garden.

I've been curious to see the
famous "Sugar Shanty."

Right, I feel like we're the
standing joke.

Well, I'd, I'd offer you some
coffee, but we're all out.

That's fine, I had some
earlier this morning.

With Nick, in fact.

Oh, really?

He came over to see Darius.

Those two are really hittin' it
off.

Well, I think it's cute.

I love what you've done with it.

Thanks.

It's dark, though, which has
to be rough.

I know if I didn't have light in
my home I'd probably sleep all

day.

So, where's the garden?

It's not doing very well.

Maybe the soil's no good.

I'll send Juan and Enrico
down, he'll bring you some fresh

soil.

No, that's fine.

I'll make it work.

Sarah, I know this has been a
rough transition for you.

I mean, I can see it.

Oh, thanks, Madeline, but I'm
fine.

You don't look fine.

Honestly, I'm fine.

Well, if you need anything
just give me a ring.

Did you come inside me?

Hello?

It doesn't matter.

You checkin' out the local
talent?

Yeah.

They call 'em "Lot Lizards."

Most of 'em are meth heads.

They'll fuck anything
that moves.

Jump in the cab of these
truckers who are parked here for

the night, get in the back, ride
'em, suck 'em, you name it.

And then jump out, go on down to
the next truck.

That one right there, she's got
a husband waitin' on her

up in lowa.

Hey, Darius.

You can't be feelin' too good.

Uhuh.

Well, you better hit the
showers, we got work to do.

Have we had sex in
every room of this place?

Yeah.

We can try the pantry next.

I'll take care of it.

Okay.

Talk to you soon.

Thanks, buddy.

It's Rick Watkins over at Fox
Farms, said you never made it

out to see him today.

I had an emergency.

Is everything okay?

You had an emergency, you didn't
have time to call me?

I'll tell you now what, Nick.

This isn't the first time this
has happened.

I can't just drop everything
here because you have

an emergency.

You didn't call, you didn't
let me know.

What's going on, Nick?

It's a very, very easy job.

I just... I
need to know that you're gonna

be there for me.

I need you to make a commitment
to me that you're gonna do

better.

I'm tired, babe.

Please, Nick.

I miss you so much.

I don't feel like it, okay?

You never feel like it.

Maybe we can see someone.

What?

There's a fertility clinic
in Kansas City.

No.

What do you mean, "No?"

I thought you said we weren't
gonna try so hard.

We haven't been trying at all.

Two months out here, and you
don't even talk to me, let alone

touch me.

All you do is hang around
with Darius and Madeline.

I work for them.

I'm lonely, Nick.

Can't you understand that?

Loneliness isn't a good
reason to have kids.

You're a fucking loser, Nick!

You're a fucking loser!

We're gonna make babies.

: Get the f...
You want to make babies?

You want to make babies?

Nick, stop!

Stop, Nick! Oww!

Nick, put that down and get
in the truck!

I'll be right back.

Go on back to the truck!

What's going on?

Go on back.

Go on, drive.

Go on, drive.

Drive.

Drive.

All right, let's drive.

Woo!

Damn, I got a little blood on
me.

That was we call a "forced
eviction."

Hey, where are you goin'?

Look, I don't want my property
burnt to the ground by some

lowlife, scud bud, meth head.

You're fucking insane.

I don't care what people do
in the privacy of their own

homes, but when they start
takin' that shit to the

streets... and the streets
of my hometown, that

is where I draw the line!

So, you take me on a
vigilante drug bust?

You're fucking nuts, Darius!

You wouldn't know a vigilante
drug bust if it stuck you in the

goddamned ass!

You get back to that truck!

You are... You're on my time!

Oh, yeah, run on back!

Run on back to New York City!

You never owned shit and
you wouldn't know how to take

care of it if you did!

I want to invite you and your
wife to dinner tonight.

You want to come?

Sure.

So, Madeline and I have
been thinking, and we've got

something that we want to run by
you guys.

I own a little farmhouse just
outside of Brownville, and I've

been rentin' it to some people.

It's a nice little place, fully
renovated indoor toilet.

They're moving out the end of
the month and, uh, well, we'd

like to move you guys in.

That being said, Nick, you've
been doin' a great job here and

I'd like to hire you on
full-time.

I would be honored to accept.

I'll be right back.

What are you doing?

"I'd be honored"?

They're going to give us a
freaking house!

So what?

Look...
Maybe, I don't want to live

in this fucking town for the
rest of my life!

Do not start that car!

You're not gonna leave me here
without wheels.

Yeah.

Do you understand me?

Try not having wheels for two
months!

You're not gonna... no, no, no.

Get the fuck out of my way!

You're a fucking loser!

Is everything all right?

Yeah, yeah.

Everything's fine.

Where's Sarah?

She left, but, uh, she'll get
over it.

Nick, you shouldn't have let
her go.

She's been drinking.

I'll go get her.

Darius, that's really
unnecessary.

Madeline's right.

She couldn't have gotten far.

Hey, can I buy you another
drink?

No, thanks.

Okay.

Hey, this is from your
friend down there.

Hit me again.

You wanna smoke?

Let's do it.

I drove up about a mile, but
I didn't see any other cars

along the highway.

She must've been drivin' pretty
fast.

Or maybe she stopped along the
way.

Fuck me.

What?

I want you to fuck me.

Harder! Harder!

Yeah!

You see the way he satisfies me!

Oh, yes!

Fucking good!

He's the best.

He's the shit.

You know that Eskimos
share their wives, right, Nick?

Yeah, I think I've heard that
before.

Well, a common misconception
is they share 'em with just

anyone.

What Darius is trying to say
is that he likes to watch other

men fuck me.

I've watched over half the
men in this county sweat over

her.

I loved every minute of it.

But this was special.

Nick!

Hey, you know things ain't
always what they seem.

Come on back here.

Come on back here and let me
tell you something.

You ain't got your pickup truck
anyway, huh.

Come on back here.

Come on, come on, come on.

You just need somebody.

Sometimes good people are
bad, the bad people are good.

Maybe you think I'm bad,
I don't know.

We all got a little bad in us.

I want you stay on, work for us.

It's a pretty good job.

You and Madeline want to play
sometime, that's fine.

I don't have to watch.

You need to learn
how to be a man.

You may look beautiful when you,
uh, when you fuck my wife, but

that don't mean you're a man!

Go ahead and beat
the shit outta me.

You think I wouldn't like it?

You think I wouldn't like it?

Look, Nick... I just...

I just want...

I just want to love you.

I don't want to go anywhere
with you!

You all right?

You okay?

Thanks.

I want to go home.

They're beautiful.

Windmills are beautiful.

It's like ballet, you know?

They just, like, they go around
and around.

It's very hypnotic, you know?

I was in Oman, driving down the
dunes, they have, like, sea... a

sea of windmills, and it...
Really, it's like,

it's the future.

You're looking at the future.

Being off the grid.

Being non-energy
dependent on oil.

Self-sufficient.

I mean, seriously, yeah.

[rock music playing faintly]

You are glowing.

Aww, thank you.

And we're still on for
brunch tomorrow?

Definitely.

I'll see you guys tomorrow.
