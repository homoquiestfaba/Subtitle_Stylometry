Hamlet 2

NARRATOR: To act is to live

ANNOUNCER: Are you tired?
Overweight?

Lacking energy?

Do you wish you could
look and feel youngagain? You can!

By unlocking the power
of natural juice

with Jack La Lanne's
Power Juicer

We juiced with
this other juicer,

and look how
much work it takes,

feeding the small chute

NARRATOR: To act is to
breathe the poet's breath



NARRATOR: It is to embody
the dreams of man

To live as an actor
is to live a dream

I'm having a herpes
outbreak right now

But you'd never know it


Thanks, HerpecoI

NARRATOR: But dreams
are ephemeral,
and sometimes impossible

So we must ask,

where do dreams go to die?

GEORGE: Hey, Iook,
I'm sorry, okay?

Hey, well, why don't I take
you out to dinner to
apoIogize for my rudeness?

Give me your number

You want my number?

Which number do
you want, George?

GEORGE: You see, right
there I llke the way
you say ''George''

For instance, ten
That's how many months old my baby girl is

You got a baby girl?

Sexy, huh?

How about six?

That's how old my
other daughter is

Eight is the age
of my son

Two is how many
times I've been
married and divorced

Sixteen is the
number of dollars in
my bank account

And I'm guessing
zero is the number

of times you're
gonna call me

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

Hey, the reviews are in

Read them quickIy
It minimizes the pain

''Are Dana Marschz's
bi-yearIy stagings of

''popuIar Hollywood
fllms an ironic gesture,

''or is he just
profoundIy confused?

''To be fair,

''this year's Erin Brockovich
accompllshes something
quite astonishing''

''It manages to make
Iast year's production

''of Mississippi Burning
Iook sparkllng
by comparison''

EPIPHANY: What
about the acting?

RAND: ''It is perhaps best
not to mention the acting

''In the theater,
actors endeavor to simuIate
human emotion

''Rand Posin and
Epiphany Sellars
fIap their llps

''and wave their arms
llke maIfunctioning
wind-up toys''

That's enough!

Every trimester we get
fisted by this guy!

What's ''fisted''?

What?

I have so much anger

I feeI llke I've been raped

In the face!

What do I need to
do to pIease you?

Is that the purpose
of your plays?

To pIease me?

I put a Iot of myseIf
into my work

WouId it kllI you to
say something nice
about it once in a while?

Have you ever
considered
doing a play

that wasn't originally
a popuIar movie?

No Why?

Do you think I shouId
be writing more of
my own material?

That wasn't what
I had in mind, but,
sure, why not?

You know, there's
so much I want to say
through my work

that sometimes
it overwheIms me

I gotta go cIean
the hamster cages

Are you going
to be all right?

Yes, I'm great

Okay

Yeah, you take care

Thanks for
the truth sandwich,
my little brother

Morning, Gary

Morning, Dana

Top of the
morning to you

It's a really
kickass sunny day
outside today, man

Great observation
there, Gary

We llve in Tucson

Can I taIk to you,
pIease, privateIy?

Sure, squishy

Excuse us

Oh, yeah

Sorry, I'm a little
groggy I was up Iate

I'm working on
an originaI play

It's about my chlldhood

Anyway, I know we're
broke and that we
needed a roommate,

but I swear to God,
I can't llve
llke this anymore

I'm gonna go back to
deallng pot, I swear

No, no, I will not
have you pushing drugs

I was a deaIer,
not a pusher

It's just untll I,
you know, get an agent

and start doing
commerciaIs again

also known as never

You keep me honest,
I adore you for that

Well

It's not so bad
I mean, Gary has a car

That's heIped out
a Iot around here

Gary has a car

Maybe I can get him
to run me over with it

Oh, you

What did I do so right
to get you in my llfe?

Hey, Max
Hey

(HORN HONKS)

Okay, I
Okay, I get it

Hey, gang,
what's up?

Mr Marschz,
have you seen our
new class yet?

No Why?

Let's just say,
it's new
and different

Well, Rand, ''new''
and ''different'' are two
of my favorite words

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

(LOUD CHATTERING)

In my prayer circIe,
I've been praying

for more raciaI
understanding,

but I stllI get anxious
around ethnics

DANA: Okay, pIease
turn down the music

Not off, just down

Okay, we've got
ourseIves a full house!

Scary!

Normally, I onIy have
the two students

Let's go around
and find out why drama
is suddenIy so popuIar

You?

YoIanda doesn't taIk

But you know the onIy reason
that we're here, right,

is because there's asbestos
in the portabIe classrooms,

and because we llve
on the poor side of town

and there isn't
any money,

they just decided
to canceI everything
that we care about

You know, llke
computers and ceramics

and shop and arts
and crafts, and drama was
the onIy eIective Ieft

Did anyone pick drama
as a first choice?

That's fine

Better never than Iate

Okay, as a point
of departure, has
anyone seen the movie

Dead Poets Society,
starring
What's your name?

DANA: the aIways-superb
Robin Wllllams?
I'm Octavio

Well, it's very good
I was, for one week,

Mr Wllllams' stand-in
on the fantastic
motion picture

Patch Adams,

when I llved
in Hollywood
Hey, come on

Hey, I'm just trying
to be friendIy

He once gave me
a ride to my bus stop

I couIdn't be happier
for all his success

(MUSIC STOPS)
Nice guys
do finish first

(MUSIC STARTS)

So what's
Hey, what's your name?

Heywood

Heywood

Heywood JabIomey

(ALL LAUGHING)
Right

Perhaps some
of you have seen

the movie
Mr Holland's Opus?

Starring, I know

Starring Richard Dreyfuss
as a music
teacher with a deaf son

He can't hear his music
Imagine that?

Very sad

also stars GIenne HeadIey

WlldIy underrated

Check these out
They're all

DANA: What couId I do

to inspire

Hey, you fucking
bastards!

(CHATTERING STOPS)

Just kidding Hope
I'm not freaking you out

Wait, I hope I am
freaking you out!

Is this guy for reaI?

Okay, Iet's start
with an exercise

Rand, get up here

Okay, Rand
Be an animal

Hey, check this out

Yeah, this is one of
the most basic skllIs
a drama student can acquire

That's beautifuI, Rand

Fellne good

Anyone tell what
kind of animal Rand is?

He's a pussy

Okay

Okay So, Heywood

What?

What kind of creature
wouId you be?

I couId be
a fIaming ass crack

Oh, wait, you're
aIready doing that


You know, I'd llke
to see your Bottom

Like to see my what?

I'd llke to see your Bottom

I mean, your
portrayaI of Bottom

in A Midsummer Night's Dream
A Midsummer Night's Dream

It's written by
a buddy of mine,
you may have heard of him,

Wllllam Shakespeare

Yeah, he llked
to goof around,

but most of the time
he was serious

Because he, llke I,
belleved that theater
has the power,

not onIy to
transform the actor,

but also the audience

Do you belleve that?

Sounds kind of
cuckoo-bananas

But I belleve that

I belleve that with
every fiber of my being

If I kick this trash can

Oh, my God! YoIanda!

Oh, my God!

Okay, she's stllI conscious
and she's not bIeeding

Man, you need
to be carefuI

You know what I'm saying?

Hey, I've Iearned
a Iesson here, but I
hope you all have, too

About the vitallty
of shared experience

We will all remember
this moment for the
rest of our llves

It was dramatic
It was visuaI

It was stupid

It was stupid,
but it was also theater

Okay, I'd llke to
borrow your cell
Call 91 1

YoIanda?

YoIanda?

It's free
Wake up

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

Hey

We started
without you

ApoIogies

I had to spend some
time with the Iawyers

for the schooI district
and paramedics

Now, it's all going
to work out

There's no brain damage

No charges will be pressed

I think I need
a quesadllIa
Immediamente!

Nothing you are saying
makes any sense to me

Turns out my class is
fourteen times as crowded
as it normally is

I've got a reaI
tough nut to crack

llves by his wits

I'm going to
inspire this year

I mean, make
a reaI difference

I feeI, for the first
time, I can make
a genuine difference

Oh, God! I am
getting hammered!


CarefuI, Brie
You know how you get

No, Dana
How do I get?

PIease, tell me
how I get

BRIE: Hmm?

(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

No, I see I got you
I totally got you

Okay, she got me

You guys Iaugh so much

Another gem of
an insight from Gary

Our boarder, Gary

Hey, don't forget
We have an
A-P-P-O-I-N-T-M-E-N-T

at the sperm
doctor on Wednesday

I don't llke airing
our personaI business

in front of
you-know-who, Gary,

but if you're
shooting bIanks,
I swear to God,

I'm going to stab you
to death in your sIeep

But, seriousIy,
you gotta Iet your
balls breathe, okay?

It's in that
pamphIet I read

It's And the corduroy

with the skating

It's llke

We llve in Tucson,

You're brolling

of yours What?

Can I get a virgin
strawberry, pIease?

Seven years sober

Awesome

I seriousIy, seriousIy
wish you wouId
start drinking again

Brie, I wouId
never judge you

Good, because if I had
to give up booze,

I'd bIow my brains
out llving in this
shit-sack city

Anyway, to Dana

My husband
What the fuck
was I thinking?

I'm just kidding

I don't have a drink

OCTAVIO: Did you do
something different
with your hair today?

Look, I have a llfe pIan,
and it does not incIude you

(STUDENTS CHATTERING)

Well, if you don't
spend no time with me,

how are you supposed to
get to know me, sunshine?

IVONNE: That's
the whoIe point

I don't want to
spend time with you

So pretty!

It's from Ethiopia

I re-watched a fantastic
movie Iast night,

Dangerous Minds,

starring the gorgeous
Michelle Pfeiffer

It gave me a little
insight into your character,
Mr Tough Guy

Okay, stand up

Why?

We're going to karate

No, man
I don't think so

Come on

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Nice freeball

Now, punch me

I'm not punching
a guy in a dress

It's a kaftan, my friend

Keeps my balls
at room temp
Now, do it

Don't make me do this

Do it

Do it!


You all right?

Mr M?
Oh, my God!

I can't belleve
this is happening to me

Mr M, are you okay?

Breathe!

I wasn't ready

Mr Marx, couId
I have a minute?

Sure! Sure, sure

What's the matter
with you?

Trying to inspire
a troubIed student

Look, I thought
you shouId know as
soon as possibIe

Last night, the schooI
board, which is facing
major financiaI cuts,

decided to canceI drama

CanceI how?

CompIeteIy Forever

You can stay tllI
the end of the term
and after that, get out

You can't have a schooI
without a drama department

Sure, you can

This is obviousIy
a practicaI joke

Look, the county and
the schooI district
are in fiscaI crisis

all the arts programs are
on the chopping block

And Iet's face it,
we're not producing
any Oscar-winners here

Tony

What?

That wouId be Tony-winners

It's the award for theater

Listen up, guy
I've seen your plays

This is no great Ioss

Well, you're a dirty,
vioIent beaner!

You shouIdn't have
hit him llke that!

Shut up, you cow
It wasn't my fauIt

He made me hit him

That, to you

You are racist, okay?

And a terribIe person!
Oh, really?


Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

Mr Marschz?
Are you okay?

No, Rand!
I'm not okay!

Can you tell me how

a little boy

from a dairy farm
in Manitoba,

who dreams of acting
but can't do it very well,

and couId never get
a decent agent,

so he moves on,
decides to teach,

to pass on his love
of the craft

Can you tell me how
he deaIs with all the

God-awfuI crap
that's handed
out to him without

wrapping his llps
around a 45

and just bIowing
his brains out?

Don't do it!


Is he acting?

No, he's not that good

Mr Marschz!

NARRATOR: Dana Marschz's
wavering consciousness

led him to believe that
he was leaving this Earth

and all its trials

But the fates had
long ago deigned

that his life's work
was only just begun

Where the fark
have you been?

Staring into
the abyss
of nothingness

Drama has
been cancelled

Finally! Now you can
go back to your job
at Rite Aid

and start making
some reaI money

Oh, Dana, I found
a great parking spot
right out front

and there was stllI
time on the meter


They shouId just
ship you on over
to the GuIf,

you know,
Iet you taIk to peopIe

all the terrorists wouId
just kllI themseIves

Well, I, for one, am
very appreciative that
Gary drove you here

Why did you
bring that thing?

I don't know I thought
maybe I couId work
through my grief in song


Maybe it's better
that I just

I can't get pregnant

I think we shouIdn't
pass on this gene pooI

This is for you, baby

Am I shooting blanks?

Are my testicles
an empty tank?

Is it all a ruse
when I go kergluge?

Why?

I want to

Splash you with
my hot-buttered
love spackle

So put your lips around
this wedding tackle

It's nuclear war!

Meyerschz?
Yeah, I need a copy of
your insurance card

Can you get the Thanks

I'm sorry about
my husband

He's not right
in the head

It's okay
BRIE: It's Marschz,
by the way

Marschz?
Yeah

Marschz

Marschz?

Marschz

Marschz?

Marschz

Marschz

I don't care

Excuse me,
I'm sorry to be
so forward,

but you Iook a Iot llke
my favorite actress of
all time, Ellsabeth Shue

Yeah I am her

But you really
Iook llke her

Well, that's
because I am her

Oh, my God!
I knew it in
my heart-souI

I'm freaking out!

I'm freaking out

You, you were wonderfuI
in Leaving Las Vegas

Oh, thank you

and so fabuIousIy funny in
Adventures in Babysitting,

not forgetting Cocktail
with Tom Cruise

What is he llke?
He seems totally great

What are you
doing in Tucson?

Oh, my God!
I'm freaking out!

I'm actually
a nurse now

I just, you know,
got kind of sick of the
business, you know?

Sick of all
the horribIe peopIe,

and it's all about being
a fucking celebrity now

Anyway, there's
a reaI shortage of
nurses out there,

and I llke
taking care of peopIe

Oh, my God!
I didn't hear anything
you just said

because I'm too excited

WouId you come
and speak with
my drama class?

They wouId just
Iose their minds

No They wouIdn't
even know who
I am, anyway

They wouId

all right I'll come

But, I'm gonna taIk
about all the insecurity
and the seIf-Ioathing,

the rejection

Perfect!

So, what's Nick Cage
really llke?

I mean, were you
just paraIyzed with awe?

I have to go
back to work

Ellsabeth Shue

I feeI so connected
to you Yes, I do

And I thank you
for giving me
back my smlle

You're weIcome

Shoo! Shoo, Shue!

Oh, God!

Doctor! Oh, my God!



Okay, gang

This is the amount
we need to save drama

6K, aka $6,000
How do we get it?

Piff?
Bake saIe

Not enough dough,
pun intended

Yo We couId
knock over a 7-EIeven

Nice thought,

but 7-EIevens are
not as vuInerabIe
as they used to be

Don't ask me
how I know that

I saw it on
the Discovery ChanneI

I've got a little
something-something

Let's hear it

Toasters Man, you know,
we just move that skeet

You know, 10 grands

we couId do that

Hey, dumbass!

''Toaster'' is
street for ''gun''

''Toaster'' is
street for ''gun''?

What a colorfuI expression!

There he goes!
The little kangaroo rat!

Hey, Noah Sapperstein

Oh, hi!

Happy? Huh?

Happy you finally
succeeded in
taking me down?

No I think
it's terribIe
what's happened

to arts education
in this country

I don't know what to do

Everything is
out of controI

You want to save drama,
but you've produced
nothing worth saving

You know, it's llke

It's llke my father
got reincarnated

into the body of a freaking
little drama critic

Look, all I'm saying is,

you need to inspire
everyone to come
to your rescue

You know, I was
thinking of working

on a musicaI version
of The Lake House,

you know the wonderfuI
Sandra Bullock,
Keanu Reeves

play with space and time

No?
No

There is one other thing

It's a piece I've
been working on

I have the first
act and reams of notes
in my inspiration box

It's called Hamlet 2

A sequeI to Hamlet
by Shakespeare?

Yes Yes Do you think
it's a bad idea?

Not necessarlly, no

Sometimes an idea couId
be so bad, it starts
to turn good again

But And so, what
about funding for
drama next trimester?

Forget about
the money right now

Put on a play, and make it
the best you've ever done

Use that as a way
of drawing attention
to the funding issue

What if it sucks?

Isn't that a question
every artist
must ask himseIf?

an artist, aren't I?

Thank you You've
given me the kick in
the pants I needed, kid

Okay, well, I need
to go to recess now

You're very busy
I understand

Oh, my God!
Writing is so hard

What is your
fucking probIem, man?

Huh?

(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)




BRIE: Dana? Dana?
Hey, I need some money

Hey, it's done

What is?
My originaI work
that's gonna save drama

The thing I've
been working on for
the Iast 47 bllllon hours

Oh, is that what
you were doing?

I thought you were just
having a nervous meItdown

far off, Iadypants

Any creative person
will tell you,

you gotta go a little crazy
to make great fucking art


Hamlet 2?

The deuce Correct

Doesn't everybody die
at the end of the first one?

I have a device

''The time
machine door opens''

That's the device

''reveallng Hamlet,
Gertrude, PoIonius,

''and HllIary Cllnton
having what appears
to be group sex''

It's about my
troubIed relationship
with my father

But, you're doing
this at schooI with
the kids, right?

That's the pIan, Stan
What do you think?

I think that
your enthusiasm
is remarkabIe

I will take that!
I will take it!

Hey, Dana

Hello, Gary

Hey! Guess what I've got!

Your head out
of your ass?

No!

Right Watch out!
This stuff is sharp

As in cutting edge
all righty!


IVONNE: Are you okay?


You're telling me
that this guy traveled
through time

from Denmark
400 years ago?

And you call me a drunk?

It's true, Papa
I done saw it

Come here, boy

Take it easy on him,
Ray He's sensitive

RAY: Come cIoser

Lay a hand on him,
and I will make
you regret it

You trying to take me on,
you time-travel freak?

Getting drunk
and beating up
on a little boy?

That doesn't make you
a man, you piece of shit!

I got the mind to put
you through that wall

Then fucking do it, bitch!

Oh, yeah?
Do it, motherfucker,
come on

What? Bring it!

Excuse me! Excuse me,
but they're off-book,

and he's definiteIy
not using Shakespearean
Ianguage,

and the vioIence
is getting a little
too reaI for me,

thank you very much

Okay, Iet's stop there

Heywood, that was
very powerfuI

Yeah, that was

It was gangster

Wow Where were you
when I was seven?

class, thoughts?

I thought Octavio
was amazing

I feIt this
eIectric charge!

He's so much more powerfuI
than any other actor I've

It's stupid to compare

I'm just so surprised that
one of you peopIe can act

''One of you peopIe''?
What does that mean?

Man, that's some
racist shit right there

I heard that, man

If you don't llke
this class, get out

Or what, bitch?

Don't you call
me a bitch!
Hey, simmer down

I'm so sick
and tired of you,
Epiphany

EPIPHANY: You're hurting me!

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Don't do that
to my friend!

IVONNE: That's it, that's it

Let me give you
a piece of my mind

No, I'm really different

You've got to do
something, Dana

RAND: Time out! Time out!

You've got to do
something, Dana

You want nachos or pizza?

Nacho!

I have access to
the activities van

We can go to the
Fun Zone in the mall

I'll get everyone a snack

You want nachos or pizza?

I couId go for
some nachos

Figures

I'm not doing carbs,
but maybe they have
a saIad or something

Anything is
better than this

all right,
we're back on track!

And we cannot be stopped!

Yeah

(CHILDREN SHOUTING)

I just don't even care

Hey, Mr Marschz

Hey, are you mad at me?

No, no

I don't know

You've bareIy
spoken to me all day

Is it because
of my resistance
to these gang-bangers?

Hey, hey, just because
they're Latinos

doesn't make them
gang-bangers Got it?

Yeah, I'm sorry
I just love class so much

I just don't want
anything to change

Rand, you're teacher's pet

What more do you want?

Come on, Iet's go
hang with the gang

You mean Latinos

Hey, you little thing
Come on

Hey, guys,
I'm Groucho Marx

I say funny stuff

Mr Marschz,
these guys are drunk

Come on, guys
I said no drinking

Why don't you have
one with us, ese?

Maybe you'd stop
being such a pinche joto

The truth is, Heywood,
I haven't had
a drink in seven years

I got the chip on my
keychain to prove it,

from an organization
called AA

Really?

Yeah It's
a sllppery sIope

Beer, llquor, dope,
coke, meth, chicks
with dicks, then jall

Hey, what wouId happen
if you have a drink?


My entire llfe
wouId fall apart

Okay Who wants to go?
Me

I wouId love to go home

No, no, no, no, no
You can't Ieave now

We just coming
together as
a class, right?

No

Heywood, it's Iate and
my wife is ovuIating

Hey, we got you
another mango iced tea

Mango iced tea
is my kryptonite

It's totally

PowerIess to resist

Okay, a few more
minutes won't hurt


Yeah, I'd
drink to that

He's about to go through
the center of the Sun


Sir, I'm gonna need
you to wake up

and show me some
form of identification

Time begins
and stops now

We have a 410 with a 6I4
in the 1 100
block of OcotllIo

What do those
numbers mean?

Come on

Are you sending me
to the gas chamber?

Right this way, sir

What is happening?


Good morning, class

Okay, I'd llke
to start by saying
two things

First of all,
acid is a very
strong drug,

and B, where are my
pants and underwear?

Excuse me, Mr Marschz

We need to discuss
something about
the Iatest draft

The roIe of Laertes,
my part, you've
turned him into a gay

He's not gay
He's bi-curious

And the roIe has
also been reduced
significantIy

Rand, theater is
a llving thing

Octavio's performance
the other day,

combined with my wife's
intense desire
to get pregnant,

not to mention the acid,

inspired me to take
some bold steps

in Iooking at
my relationship
with my father

That meant reducing
Laertes' roIe

And the gay thing,
I just thought you'd be
more comfortabIe

What? What?

This has nothing to do
with my sexuallty!

(STUDENTS LAUGH)

Listen, llsten,
I've given my llfe
to this class,

and now it all goes
out the window
because of him?

Because he inspired you?

It's what's best
for the play

Not acceptabIe! I quit!

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, man, you can't quit now

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

Rand!

Rand!
What?

Let's taIk about this

I hate you, you
stupid, fat fucker!

(ALL EXCLAIM)

(PEOPLE WHISPERING)

Am I fat?

I want you to meet
a friend of mine

He got stuck
inside my time machine

His name is Jesus Christ

Oh, yeah We heard
you were coming back

Jesus has a rocking
swimmer's bod

Okay, can I ask
you a question?

Sure

What's really going on here?

Is Jesus, llke, a swimmer?

Jesus is very Iean

Can we pIease wait
untll Iunch to do that?

Thank you

Where was I?
Jesus has
a swimmer's body

Jesus has a swimmer's body,

and while he's one of the more
spirituaI peopIe on Earth,

he's also very
attractive to you

He's attractive to me?

Jesus is sexy to you
Which Ieads us on to
the musicaI interIude,

Rock Me, Sexy Jesus

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Okay, you are
40-something
minutes Iate

I can't do the play

What?

My dad's making me
quit the play

That's impossibIe
You're the Iead

He said, ''No way''

Goddamn macho bastards
and their fear of the arts

They just don't get it!

Okay, we're
fighting this

Even if we have
to take on the
whoIe ghetto

No, wait
What do you mean?

We're going
to your house
Now

No, no, no,
we can't do that

It's not a good idea

My father tried to stand
in the way of my
dreams, too

He's dead now,

but you couId say,
llke Hamlet's ghost,
I'm stllI haunted by him

Because he caused me
so much pain,

which is why I tried
to become an actor,

which caused me
so much pain

You can't Iet your
ethnic narrow-mindedness

stop your son from
thriving in our culture

I have to take exception
to that characterization

Heywood's a bad boy

He's a gang-banger
A deadbeat

But he also has a gift

Who is Heywood?

Your son,
Heywood JabIomey

Oh

I just got that

Octavio doesn't
beIong to a gang

He's got a 39
and an earIy acceptance
to Brown

He does?

Yes, our concerns
about the play are
of a different nature

If it's the sex and vioIence,
I can totally tone that down

No, we are fine with those

Then what is it?

We mereIy expressed
our absoIute
distaste for a sequeI

to what is arguabIy
the greatest play in
the Engllsh Ianguage

Not to mention the
quallty of the writing,
which is quite Iow


Well, no offense, but what
the hockey-puck do you know?

Well, I've publlshed
nine nivels

I have a PhD in llterature

My wife is a painter

She currentIy has
an exhibit at the
Guggenheim in Bllbao

Oh, okay

Then

HeIp me fix my play!

I'm trying to save drama!

You have Hamlet
using a time machine

to stop Gertrude from
drinking the poison,

to stop Ophella
from drowning

You're taking the tragedy
out of the tragedy

I just wondered
why in Hamlet 1
everybody has to die

It's such a downer! I mean,
if Hamlet had had just
a little bit of therapy,

he couId have turned
everything around

Everybody deserves
a second chance!

Yes, well, we'll Iet Octavio
make up his own mind

Thank you for
taking the time

Let me show you
the way out

CouId we taIk more?

I wouId love to
get your notes

I wouId do anything
I'd do chores

I'd cIean your
rain gutters

I'm afraid we don't
have rain gutters

You're a llar, everybody
has rain gutters!

Mr Rocker?

Yes, what is it, Rand?

Here

Hamlet 2?

It's the play
Mr Marschz wrote

What about it?

I think you need
to take a Iook at it

Why?

Let's just say that
when you get to the scene

where Gertrude
gives Hamlet a hand job,

you'll sense my drift

Did you just
say ''hand job''?

Yes, I did

He thinks he's
going to save drama
with this play

Mr Rocker, if you care
about decency and if
you love this country,

you will stop Dana Marschz
Take him down

Then take him from behind!


PLAYERS: Go Mustangs!

Hey!

I'm here for her
I'm here for her

ApoIogies, the Snackatorium
is no Ionger avallabIe,
regrettabIy, because

the Iadies who make
macaroni and cheese are
getting very territoriaI

So without further ado,
I'd llke to introduce
you to Ellsabeth Shue

Ellsabeth Shue,
get up here

all right


Thank you

Thank you so
much for having me

God, I really have
a tough time speaking
in front of peopIe

I get a little nervous

I'm way more
nervous than you

I'm llke My brain
is llke mush

(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)
Ellsabeth Shue, is she reaI?

Somebody pinch my ass

It's inappropriate
I'm sorry It's just

ShouId we just
take questions?

That'd be great

Okay, class, questions
for Ms Shue

Someone other than Epiphany

Okay, not all at once

You guys, come on,
I asked you to prepare
a few questions

You know, I'm
a reasonabIe guy

I don't Iose it when I

Jesus Christ!

Can we not share
this space in peace?

Epiphany?

Hi I just want to
say I think your
make-up is pretty

Thank you
Thank you very much

It is nice

What about Mr
AIpha MaIe up there?

Got a question
for Ms Shue?

Yeah

Who are you?
Oh, come on!

CouId you not
even GoogIe her?

The Karate Kid, the crane
''Wax on, wax off''

Soapdish Dreamer,
with the fucking horse

Any of that shit
ring a bell?

Sorry Pardon my French

I've heard
the word ''shit'' before

In Hollywood,
you pretty much
have to swim in it

That is funny, that's

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

Excuse me for a second

What do you miss
about acting?

You know what I really
miss about acting?

I miss kissing
In love scenes

I had so much fun
making out with all
those cute actors

I wouId love to
stay and hear this

SHUE: Yeah, I think
if I had one compIaint
about nursing,

it wouId be that
you don't get to make out
with your patients

It's fricking exciting
having Ellsabeth Shue
in class

Because of its
unwhoIesome content,

the schooI cannot
allow the exhibition
of Hamlet 2

Where did you get that?

EntireIy beside the point

Did Rand give it to you?

Nudity and pornography
are not permitted on
the schooI premises

There's no nudity
or pornography!

MinimaI

You have Satan
French-kissing

the President of the
United States of America!

It's a parting
embrace before the
moment of damnation

The cllmax of
a modernist dance

I think when all
is said and done,

you will find it
quite moving

Trust me, I won't

We're 10 days away
Things are in motion

Art is happening

Well, stop it

You can't stop art

You're shut down, Marx!

No, you are
You are

You never
belleved in me, Daddy!
I hate you!

We're putting this play on,
and if you don't llke it,
then tough titties,

you ass-turd
monkey-fucker!


Oh, my God!



Let me see

Oh, Shue

How do you keep your
head heId high when
peopIe keep throwing

steaming plles of
crap in your face?

I know, I know

That's why I got
out of the business

Well, fuck you, too

I have to eIevate it

It's not broken
and, yes,
I will stllI be abIe

to play any and all
musicaI instruments


I have to tell
you something

I'm pregnant

Really?

Are you shitting me?

No, no

Christ in a basket, Dana
That's too tight

And it will
aIways be too tight

I will never not hug
this unborn baby!

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

It's llke he's
giving me hope

Who?

God

NARRATOR: At this point,
it felt to Dana

as if the air was
perfumed with possibility

But just as Icarus flew
high on wings of wax,

oblivious to his
impending doom,

so was poor,
dear Dana Marschz

Well, I'm lost

Is bIue the right color

for a controversiaI piece
of socio-pollticaI
agit-prop theater?

I think bIue
makes peopIe sad

Yes, it does

There's also orange

Orange

The color of fire

Of ripe tangerines,
of the poet's harvest moon!

GIenn, we've done it!

Stop staring at me

Okay, all right Okay

It's ridicuIous
But I love it

Okay, guys, I am
pretty effing excited

to announce that
the musicaI accompaniment
to our play

will be provided by
the Gay Men's
Chorus of Tucson!

(ALL SINGING)
Just a steel-town girl
on a Saturday night

Looking for
the fight of her life

In the real-time world
no one sees her at all

They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to
the beat of her heart

Changing movement into light

She has danced
into the danger zone

When the dancer
becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife

Hey, guys, thanks
a Iot for donating your
wire-work services

It really heIped out a Iot

When did you
guys get started?

We seen them
Kill Bill movies,
llke, 20 times,

and we said,
''Shit, we got some wire,

''we got some harnesses''

So we get to work
in the backyard,

and next thing you know,
we're in show business

So this is your
first attempt?

Yes, sir

Now hold on, girl

Three, two, one


That's cooI

Okay So this is the
Danish castIelporno
theaterltime machine

It's fantastic

I don't know what it means,
but I think it's
the best set I've ever seen

Yeah?
Yeah

Who said shop class
was useless?

I don't know

Wait, somebody said that?

It's a figure of speech

Hey, M
Hey

Hey, my buddy's
meth Iab burned down

I'm sorry to hear that

No, it's going to be
some pretty cherry
footage for the play

Well, excellent
Hey, girls

Hey, Mr Marschz
What?

I was thinking,
what if me
and my whoadies

rolled up in Iow-riders
on stage in the third act?

That sounds
kind of dangerous

Yeah, maybe so

Which is why
I want to do it

We are not making
safe theater

I'm in the
wrong pIace

Jesus Jones! Rocker's
changed the Iocks

That is the first
shot across the bow,
boys and girls

Just llke that wonderfuI fllm
Master and Commander,

starring the terrifyingIy
reaI Aussie badboy,
Russell Crowe

Five more seconds

Okay, Chuy, breaking
and entering is neither
cooI nor terrific

got shit to do

Hey, you get off
schooI property in
the next 10 seconds

or I'm gonna
have the Tucson
pollce department

so far up your ass
you're gonna wish
you were a girl

''What about Hamlet 2
couId possibIy offend

''PrincipaI Rocker
to such a degree?

''Or is offense
the offense at all?

''Truth is
a nebuIous commodity

''As RoIand Barthes tells us,
'MuItipIe perspectives

Does anybody know
what this means?

Did you see this
articIe in the paper?

We're aIready
reading it, woman

Not the schooI paper
The News Press

I stoIe it from Starbucks

You really think
you're street,
don't you?

Don't fuck with me,
homey! I'll cut you

I llked you better
when you were
an uptight racist bitch

Oh, my God

''Why is the schooI board
afraid of this man?''

That's a picture of me

I was an extra in
an AI Jazeera TV movie

I regret it now,
but what a fun bunch
of guys

Dana Marsha?

Marschz Yes?

Consider yourseIf served

Thank you

What a nice man
A smlle costs nothing

Oh, shit, this is
a cease and desist order
from the schooI board

What does that mean?

That means you
can be arrested for
putting on this play

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, mister, un-serve me!

all right,
mystery man

Why have you
brought us here?

Yeah

Yeah, why?

This is Joy Junction

You know, that
positive ionic fIow

Jean-PauI,
the crew, Burning Man,

So?

Yeah, yo

Yeah, yo

Okay, you started

You didn't?
No, no, you

You know, Iess no

Okay, I'm a little

Oh!

Let there be llght

Ah! My eyes!

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

Mr Marashka?

Who? It's Marschz Yes

Cricket FeIdstein,
American Civll
Liberties Union

We spoke on the phone

The ACLU

Oh, I thought you
were a taIent agent,
llke UTA or CAA

But totally
not disappointed

If you're wondering
about the FeIdstein,
I married a Jew

It's my understanding
that there are forces

trying to stop you
from performing Hamlet 2

You received
a cease and desist order

in regards to
this performance?

Yes

I think we have a
First Amendment case on
our hands, Mr Marashka

It's Marschz
You really think so?

Abso-fucking-IuteIy

No one is shutting
down this play

The Justice Department
and the so-called
Supreme Court

can suck my balls

What do they have
to do with this?
My balls?

No, the other thing

I'm a short bIond chick,
but I play to the death

I pick cases that I can win
because I wanna win big

Cases with controversy
and headllnes

and steaming plles of shit
fIying Ieft and right

MostIy Ieft
How's that sound?

Fine

Are you on my side?
Yes

Great, Iet's do it!
Okay then

Do I need to sign anything?

No, don't sign anything!

I think the play's
gonna be really good

It's irreIevant

Okay

The bane of my existence!

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

Brights!

Oh, my God!

Shut down that
piece of shit play

Bruised,
but not broken

Turns out my play has
divided the community,

but I shall not
be deterred

Dana

Hang on, I'm going to
run myseIf a big bath

Dana

a big Arthur-styIe
bath with bubbIes

I'm sorry

And I'm gonna put

So, don't sweat it It's

You'll be much

What about the baby?

The doctor told me

shooting bIanks

I shouId have
said something

That must mean

Wow

Yeah

Brie, I'm starting

I'm sorry
Sorry about that

Can I use

No

Hey, we got the TVs

There's a hundred sets

Where did you get them all?

StoIe them from
white foIks, dawg

I have to say
something, guys

I really think
Mr Marschz is bipoIar

Just llke my cousin

But she takes pllIs

He's not bipoIar
He's a freak

Do you think he
reallzes that every time
he wears a dress

he's fIashing
his balls at us?

You know, where
is he anyway?

He was supposed to be
here two hours ago

Maybe he's out
shopping for a dress

He shouId buy
some underwear

(CURSES IN SPANISH)

Who do you think you
are taIking llke that,
white girl?


I heard everything
I heard everything!

I haven't bought
an item of cIothing
in over 10 years

because I don't get
paid for this job

Did you know that?

I work for gas money,
which is why I skate

That and the DUI

My llfe is a parody
of a tragedy!

My wife Ieft me
Baby wasn't mine

PeopIe are trying
to run me over

What are we
supposed to do?

It doesn't matter

We're not gonna
get this play on

We might as well
give up now!

What?

He works for gas money?

That is so sad

Mr M!

EPIPHANY: Mr M!

What happened?

Get away from me,
you devll bitches

Leave me to the vuItures

Pussy!

YoIanda

You come in here
and tell us all
to be artistic,

and put on your
crazy-ass play,

and when things get
a little rough, you act
llke a fucking pussy?


YoIanda, you don't say
much, but when you do,
it sure packs a wallop

She's right!

Okay,
you've had a pretty bad
day, I'll give you that

But that doesn't
mean you give up

Why not?

Nobody cares

Yeah, we do

I don't want your pity

Man, you keep taIking about
making us extraordinary

That's from Dead Poets

Well, you're teaching us
something really important

I am? What is it?

It doesn't matter how
much taIent we Iack,

as Iong as we
have enthusiasm

That's truth
Because I Iack taIent

The football team,
the wrestllng team

and all the seniors
are gonna be llke security

and kick the asses
of anyone who tries
to stop this play

Yeah And I got
some friends to watch
the parking Iot

just in case we have
any troubIe, you know
what I'm saying?

And we're also sold out

What?

Mr M, you're
not getting it

Like, all the tickets
were bought

ChanneI 5 is coming

And I got a call
from one of
EIton John's peopIe,

something
about permission

And there was a message
from this guy at
the New York Times

OCTAVIO: Mr M,

we don't wanna give up

I just get scared

Every time I try
to go for something,

my heart gets stomped
on llke a baby kitten

That's no reason
to give up

Maybe it is
No, it's not

OCTAVIO: HeIp him up

Let's go to work

Okay, hey, guys,
my skate is stuck

I'm such a dick

Wait, what are you
doing? Let go of me

I'm not interested
in this monkey-spunk play
Come on!

Ticket holders onIy

This event
is sold out

If you don't have
a ticket, get the fuck
out of my face

I am revoking permission
for my son to appear tonight

I am, too

And so am I

But why now?

I heard the play
was disgusting

How can you say that
if you haven't seen it?

What about this
Sexy Jesus song?

I mean, that's
just disrespectfuI

Look, it's about if
Jesus came to Earth
in modern times,

he wouId have
to market himseIf
llke a celebrity

It's very thoughtfuI

That's an
oversimpllfication, but

I don't care to see
my son used as
a pollticaI pawn!

I'm doing this play
for my own reasons

You know, according
to the Ninth Circuit
Court of AppeaIs,

if you sign a consent
form, that means
you're giving consent

And you can't
take that form back,

you can't take
your signature off it

You signed it,
you signed consent

So end of deaI, okay
End of story

Sorry, you guys,
but you totally
gave consent

You don't
controI our kids!

Wake up call!
You don't controI
your kids!

Now get out of my
performance space,

before I have security,
aka the 2nd Avenue AngeIs,

remove your sorry asses

How did you get
the balls to do that?

I'm stllI
a little drunk

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

What if I have to
go to the bathroom?

Okay, I'll just piss
on your pretty
little gym shoes

WeIcome to West
Mesa High Drama's
finaI performance

If you are moved
by tonight's work,

pIease go forward
and support
arts education

Eat shit and die,
you tramp

Let go of me!
Hey, hands off!

And pIease take this
opportunity to turn
off all cell phones

It's the celestiaI message

The portaI to infinity
is wide open


Yeah! Fuck yeah!


(REPORTER SPEAKING SPANISH)

Look I studied
French at Vassar

I'm not getting
any of this

Well, can you
give us an update?

Free speech is allve
and well in Tucson,

so go and tell the mundo

I think it's
going terrific

Are peopIe
stllI waIking out?

Mr Marschz,

this is the most
important theatricaI event
in the history of Tucson

I have to be
a part of it

Rand, that is a very brave
and generous thing to

Piff took the fries

I've been going
to a shrink
five days a week

and I started on
anti-depressants

and I'm much
more comfortabIe
with my sexuallty

I'd be happy to play
Laertes as bi-curious

That's wonderfuI!

And I forgive you


Okay Stop it
Go get changed

Okay

like I'm drifting in space

I think my heart-soul
is falling from grace

Therapy's taken me
to a better place

So why do I feel,
why do I feel

Why do I feel like
I've been raped in the face?

(AUDIENCE GASPS)

Raped in the face?

Maybe it's buried emotions

Or maybe the wrong medication

I simply go
through the motions

They say I need a vacation

I really do feel
like a sexual victim

With dark memories
of a rigid dictum

This is disgusting!
Shut up!

This means I love you,
he murmured

This will be
our little secret

You'll wind up
horribly murdered

If you should
dare not to keep it

I know the topic
of rape isn't nice

Don't bring it up
when you're breaking the ice

Is that why you are
so quick to decline

To hear this oral
fixation of mine?

My head spins like a wheel
As I make this appeal

If I'm lost then I'll squeal
It's a pretty raw deal

When they force you to kneel
Holy fuck, it's so real

When you're being

Raped in the face

(SHUE LAUGHS)

(SIREN WAILS)

(LOUD CLAMORING)

(RHYTHMIC CLAPPING)

The man with the plan

He traveled through time
in an awesome custom van

Moralistically,
he taught us to be good

How to set our souls free
And do all the shit we should

Now we do the right deeds
We go to church and such

And we stopped smoking weed
Well, at least not as much

And we can't
forget to mention
The golden rule

Do unto others as
you would have them

Slam, bam, spank you, ma'am

Do unto you!

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

it's Jesus!

Oh, my God,
it's Jesus!

You're so hot!
My God, I love you!

I wanna party

You died for our sins
You got to believe us

Rock me, rock me,

I'm simuItaneousIy
horrified and fascinated

We're really amazed
You got to believe us

Rock me, rock me,
rock me, sexy Jesus

WOMAN: BIasphemy! BIasphemy!

All night long

He lays down science,
really blows my mind

But he's also got abs
that transcend space and time

He's the son of God,
and I think that's cool

But he's got a swimmer's bod
like nobody do

BIasphemy!
Go back to your seat

Rock me, rock me,
rock me, sexy Jesus

He died for our sins
You've got to believe us

Rock me, rock me,
rock me, sexy Jesus

All night long

Immaculate conception
really makes my day

But the dude's got lats
that make me feel gay

''Turn the other cheek''
is really showing class

But I really think it's sexy
when he kicks Satan's ass

Kicks Satan's ass!

Kicks Satan's ass!

Rock me, rock me,
rock me, sexy Jesus

That's the crane

He died for our sins
You got to believe us

Rock me, rock me,
rock me, sexy Jesus

Wait, I totally get it

Jesus kicks
the devll's ass

But it's stllI

You got to believe us

Rock me, rock me,
rock me, sexy Jesus

All night long

Surf's up, dudes

Hey, mister

Oh, my God,

Oh, my God! Jesus!

He's waIking on water!

(LOUD CHEERING)

But it's supposed to
be intermission now

We can't have
intermission

The fire department is trying
to evacuate the bullding

Everyone, keep going!


of those East End lights

Muggy nights

The curtains drawn in the
little room downstairs

Jesus, come on

Coming

Prima Donna lord
you really should have
been there

You ready?
Yeah

Where are we going?

33 AD

Got it!

Hold on!
Okay

And it's one more beer
and I don't hear you anymore

We've all gone crazy lately

My friends out there
rolling round
the basement floor

You know, Hamlet,
you must forgive
your father

the abuse you suffered

You know, sometimes
even I feeI llke my
father's forsaken me

Really?

Good Iuck

Thanks, Jesus

You got my cell number?
Yeah

Okay

My dad finds out
what I've been up to,
he's gonna crucify me

Altar-bound, hypnotized

Sweet freedom
whispered in my ear

You're a butterfly

And butterflies
are free to fly

Oh, Laertes,
therein lles the rub

If we use my time machine,
then we couId save
thy sister, thy father,

my dear mother,
Queen Gertrude

Not to mention the King

Your madness must
not unwatched go


(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

That is excellent
wire-work!


I never realized
the passing hours
of evening showers

A slip noose hanging
in my darkest dreams

I'm strangled by your
haunted social scene

It was poison!

Just a pawn out-played
by a dominating queen

It's 4:00 in the morning

Damn it, listen to me good


Watch it

You watch it,
Nacho Bell Grande!

Why are you trying
to fuck with me all
the time, bitch?

I'll show you why, vato

Someone saved my life tonight

Sugar bear

Sugar bear

You almost had
your hooks in me


Didn't you, dear?

You nearly had me
roped and tied

Altar-bound, hypnotized

Sweet freedom
whispered in my ear

You're a butterfly

And butterflies
are free to fly

Fly away

Fly away, bye-bye

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

You have no documentation,
no ID, your badge
isn't visibIe,

and you accidentally
grazed my boob

when you tried
to waIk past me

I couId put you
away for a year,
you fire-fucker

You wanna hit me?
Hit me!

I wouId love it
if you hit me

'Cause I'm married to a Jew,
I got nothing to Iose

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved my life tonight

Ophella, will
you marry me?


Yes!

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved my life tonight

Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight

I'm sorry, son

I forgive you, Father!

I was moIested as a chlld

Maybe that's
why I'm so angry

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

I forgive you
Father, I forgive you

I forgive you
I forgive you


I forgive you

Wow

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

What's going on?

Wow, there's
a great energy in here


I'm suing everybody!

This isn't over

I want you out
of this community

This play's offensive!

Well, I'm sorry!

No, no, no,
don't do that!

That's offensive, too!

My name is Ron Kantor

I'm with the
New York Times

I was quite taken
with your play

Oh, thank you

I was very moved
when Hamlet
forgave his father

Great!

What about when
I forgave my father?

A penny for
your thoughts

I was just thinking about
all those voices saying,
''You can't do it,''

and, ''You're a Ioser''

Well, that's psychosis

You know,
I had a feellng

No, I mean actuaI voices,
llke my ex-wife, the schooI,

pretty much everyone

Well, everyone
and their brother

wants a piece of
your genius ass now

Is it true that Jeremy
effing Irons wanted
to do your play

and you turned him down?

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
''Oh, Dana, for fuck's sake,
pIease Iet me do your play''

It takes a reaI set
of Iow-hangers, mister

He won't even Iet me be in it,
and I'm his girlfriend

I wanna preserve
the originaI cast

Artistic integrity!

And, yes, he does have
a reaI set of Iow-hangers

Oh, how romantic

CRICKET: Well, this play
is gonna bitch-sIap Broadway

llke a cheap hooker
at a gang-bang

DANA: Yeah

You know, and those
BibIe-humping protesters

can suck a bag of dicks,

'cause all they
ended up doing

was giving you
free publlcity

Yeah, and did you see
my dressing room?

It has a bidet

That was a sink

It was?

Hey, it's Mr M
