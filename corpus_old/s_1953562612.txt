I wish I could say
I'm getting used to being

a prophet of God,

but I'm still not quite sure
I have a handle on it.

I just want you all to know
that you are loved.

And you, sir, you are only
going to be unemployed

for a few months.

I'm losing my job?

But then later,
like, six weeks after,

you're gonna get your dream job
at the art museum!

But I'm losing my job?
Who have you been talking to?

No, no, no. No, no, no,
you're missing the point.

You are loved.

The thing is,

this gift of mine didn't come
with an instruction book.

I really needed
that instruction book.

And then it hit me,

there's totally
an instruction book!

Oh, come on.
We have to have a Bible.

Come on, Tom,
tell me we own a Bible.

We're not heathens.
We're not heathens.

Beth, I think it's great that
you're reinventing yourself,

but can I just point out

that we've been
down this road before?

There was the juicing thing,
then there was a magnet thing,

and then there was
the drinking thing.

That was
my least favorite thing.

Tom, this is not a thing.
God talks to me.

Also, I may have put
your ex mistress in a coma,

so I think
it's only appropriate

that I would seek
some guidance, no?

How is Carly, by the way?

Well, you know, some
encouraging signs yesterday.

Someone turned on the TV
in her room

and she appeared to grimace
at Katherine Heigl.

That is a good sign.

Now, didn't your mother give us
a Bible when we got married?

That was the good sex Bible.

A Bible!
We have one.

Oh, we are good, decent,
you-fearing people.

Whoa.

You had that in our house
with our daughter?

Holy moly,
I really am a bad mom.

Oh, I'm gonna go flush this...

Amazing-smelling bud.

And get a new Bible.

Oh, nuts.

Wow, reading the Bible.

I'm really impressed.
Oh, yup, devouring it.

I mean,
I am just loving these guys,

uh, Cain and Abel.
Classic bromance.

Cain hates Abel. He kills him.
All right.

Truth be told, I don't
understand a word of this thing.

You know, the king James Bible

is the double-black diamond run
of bibles.

There are other versions
that might be more accessible.

There are?

Oh, my God! There are even
pictures. Thank you.

It's open!

Hi.
Hello.

Oh, hey, guys.
Hi.

We just stopped by to tell you
some interesting news

about our neighbor Ruby.
Aka "rotten Ruby."

Aka "Ruby the ruiness."
Aka "the stench."

They don't all have to be clever.
She's an awful person.

Anyway, she is finally
leaving the neighborhood.

Ruby's leaving?
Did she die?

Ruby the rat is leaving?

Rubella Deville is leaving?

Not quite yet,
but we're in the end game.

This petition is all we need

to get Ruby's house declared
a public nuisance.

We just need
two more signatures.

And you saved us for last.
We're honored.

Well, we all
had our problems with Ruby,

but Beth had a truly special
relationship with her.

Yes, I did indeed.

Get off my lawn!

It's the sidewalk, you old bat!

You just think it's your lawn
'cause you don't cut your grass!

I'll shoot you.
I swear to God, I will.

You don't know
how to work that thing.

Try me, bitch.

"Try me, bitch."

Whoo!

You're making me
have to pee more, bitch!

Get outta here!

Anyway...

Good riddance, Ruby.
That's all she wrote.

We're going to go take
a victory lap around the block.

Maybe toss some garbage
into her yard

for old times' sake.

Oh, Tom.

Remember when we used to
fantasize about a gay couple

moving into that house
and fixing it up? Tad and...

Tad and Benicio.
That's right.

Tad was an attorney
for the music industry.

And Benicio was a buyer
for restoration hardware.

Our property values were
going to go through the roof.

Architectural digest
was going to come

and shoot every other week.

And they were gonna
spend hours doing my hair.

Oh, 117! 117.
[Ethereal music]

What?
What?

Oh, in the book.

117, page 117.

Um... okay,
"the good samaritan."

Um, "even though
he was his sworn enemy,

he still helped him, for he
could not let him suffer."

Oh, no.

Oh, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

What?
God is telling me

that I gotta help
Ruby the rat face!

What do you mean "help"?

I mean I can't let Ruby
get kicked out of her house.

I have to be the one
to help her fix it!

Oh, no, Beth.
You can't.

What can I tell you?
God is telling me

to be a good samaritan.
I don't like it either.

Mom, the gays.
Oh, honey, I know.

Okay, God,
this is what you really want.


You never learn, do you?

According to my
children's Bible

it's the samaritan's job
to prove how good they are.

I had to believe that once Ruby
saw that I was a friend,

it would soften her up.

Ow! Hey!
Ruby, whoa! All right, hey!

Stop, stop!
Ruby, would you cut it out?

I'm here to help you.

You're just here
to pee on something!

Look, everybody
in the neighborhood

has signed a petition to get you
kicked out of your house,

so if you don't
let me help you,

you're gonna get
forced out of here.

I don't want your help!

Drop it and move on!

All right, forget it.
I tried. I really did.

I came over here
with kindness in my heart,

and all I did was get pelted
with insults and food!

Who are you talking to,
nut case?

You know what,
if you were a nice old lady

with a horrible house,
I would help you out.

If you were a horrible old lady

in a nice, little house,
I would help you out.

I would make an effort,

I would come on over,
try to have a cup of tea,

maybe find something
to like about you,

something
we would have in common,

but you know what?

You can't get blood
from a turnip!

"Blood from a turnip?"
Why'd you say that?

I don't know! I don't know.
It just popped into my head.

I've never said it before
in my life.

My husband used to say that.

And how long
were you married for, Ruby?

38 years.

Oh.
Leon used to spend

all his time
puttering in the yard,

fixing things
all around the house.

He'd come in
every little bit and say,

"I just came in for a hug,
love bug."

Give me a hug and go on back
to the garden or whatever.

What are you doing?

Tom, what the heck
is happening out there?

Please explain to me
what my eyes just saw.

Beth got it in her head
that she's supposed to be

a good samaritan.
She wants to help Ruby

fix up her house.

What? No!
Tom, we're this close

to getting rid of her and
getting somebody good in there.

Maggie and I have always
had this fantasy

of getting a gay couple
on the block.

No way.

Me and Jenna
had the exact same fantasy.

Yeah, us too.
Ours are Tad and Benicio.

Ours are Steven and Raif.

Steven owns several
high-end restaurants,

Raif designs women's shoes.

Mine are Kelly and Kelly.

Kelly's a lipstick lesbian
with a killer ass,

and Kelly's
another lipstick lesbian

with another killer ass.

Mmm.
Mmm. Well,

none of us have any chance
of getting our dream gays

unless you make your wife stop.

What is this, the 1800s?

You can't make a wife
do something.

That's true.
That's good.

She thinks it's God's will.

Does she know
that God split a baby in half?

God split a baby in half, Tom.
Tell her that one.

Look, my wife is
making herself a better person.

What kind of person am I
if I discourage it?

For the sake of me
and Kelly and Kelly

and their gay twin sisters

who I haven't even
told you about yet,

you discourage her, Tom.
You discourage her.

Ah, ah!

Oh, shoot.

I don't suppose
you want to put that

back on up here for me, do you?

Nope.

Okay, well, you know who could
use a good samaritan?

Me.

I could use a good samaritan.

I'm looking for a few
good samaritans

to help me with
the home improvement project.

The reward is your soul.
Beth,

it's adorable you're attempting
to help that awful woman,

but no way is anyone else
on this block lending a hand.

She happens to not be
a horrible woman.

She just drinks
and smells like feet.

Those are actually her
best qualities in my opinion.

Beth, come on. You've already
proved you're a good person.

You've gone above and beyond.
Now, as your husband,

I got to step in and tell you
enough is enough.

Oh, really? You're stepping in
as my husband?

What is this, the 1800s?

I tried to tell them that.
Look, it's not the 1800s.

You guys,
in my heart of hearts,

I know this
is the right thing to do,

and there is
a little bit of a trick.

If you put some cedar
under your nose,

she smells like Christmas.

I could really use
a few strong men

to help me with that man stuff.

Well...
Pete, Pete,

Pete. Don't fall for it.
I guess I-

it's a girl trick.
Fine.

Forget you two.
Honey?

Oh, really? You're gonna
let me hang like this?

Even if we fix her stuff up now,
she can't take care of it.

She'd be much better off
going to some condo

where she can swear at people
who get paid to fix her stuff.

But that's not what she wants.

She wants to be in her house
and swear at us.

I can't believe you're not gonna
help me help her have that.

You know what?
God knows when you're naughty.

That's Santa.

Don't ruin my exit.

God split a baby in half.

Unbelievable.
No one wants to help.

So!

It wasn't my pot in there
after all... it was yours.

It's medicinal.

I have anxiety because
I have a mom who talks to God.

You know,
I took so much fish oil

when I was pregnant with you
to protect your brain cells.

I would really hate it
if you killed them all off.

It's no big deal.
Oh.

Everyone does it.
Honey, it is a big deal.

Do you not remember
what it was like in this house

when I was partying?
How pathetic I was?

Yeah, well,
I'm not going to be pathetic.

No one sets out to be pathetic,
they just end up there,

and then they want
to get back to normal,

and they can't find the map,

and then they ask someone
for directions,

and it turns out
to be Amanda Bynes!

Would you just punish me
already?

No, I don't want to punish you.

Instead of you getting high

to escape your mom, I want you
to get high with your mom.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

It's a metaphor, isn't it?
It is.

You are going to
experience the high

of helping a neighbor in need.

Well, that's not fair.
Dad doesn't even have to help!

Well, dad wasn't just
caught with pot.

No! Dad got caught
having an affair,

which is arguably worse.
Are we doing this?

Wow, you're in?
Well, it's not the 1800s,

but I can't let my wife
do man's work.

Come on.

Can I ask you a question?
Sure!

How do you know is God?

Oh, wow.

Um, I don't know, I just do.
I just... I just know.

Oh, the faith argument?

You God people always
pull that one out like it's...

It's some justification
for no evidence whatsoever.

So you don't believe in God?
Absolutely not.

Emily!

I'm on the fence too.
We should talk.

So you think I'm crazy?

Well, if you're not crazy,
then he is.

So God allows wars, but he cares

so deeply about humanity
that he's gonna reach down here

and tell some drunk, white,
suburban mom

to fix up
some smelly bitch's house?

I'm right here.

Oh! Sorry, Ruby.

I don't have all the answers.

I wish I did, but if you don't
want to believe, don't believe.

I'm not going to force
my beliefs on you.

Oh!
Are you okay?

Is she going to make it, doc?

Thankfully, yes,
and may I say,

you are rocking
the thick neck look.

Oh, you know, a good model
can sell anything with attitude.

Seriously,
you're one lucky lady.

Lucky?
Absolutely,

to fall from that height
and walk away with a sprain,

someone's looking out for you.

That was not literal.
I didn't mean that literally.

He didn't mean it literally.
It's just an expression.

Right, you said it.
You can't take it back now.

All right. As your doctor,
I order you to rest.

No climbing, no lifting,

and as someone
who really wants gay neighbors,

no helping horrible people
who smell like feet.

She is not a horrible person.

Still, isn't it possible
that you falling off the roof

is a sign,
a sign saying to stop?

A stop sign, if you will.

Thank you.
Well,

maybe I stuck my fat neck

into the wrong person's
business.

I just can't believe
I was so wrong.

I can't believe that he/she
would lead me so far astray.

It doesn't make any sense.

You know what makes sense?
Huh?

Pizza.

It never disappoints.
It's always there for you.

The gang's all here.
Hi, guys.

All: Hey.
What's going on?

We are partying like it is
nineteen-ninety-no-more-Ruby.

Yeah, we're finally gonna send
that disgusting old troll

back under the bridge
where she belongs.

Mm!
And our lives will be perfect.

Seriously?
Your lives already are perfect.

Beth.
Oh, come on. I mean...

You have so many blessings.
You're gonna focus

on chasing this poor woman
out of her house?

What are you do...
Jenna, you're a Bible person.

I know it's wrong, but I like
that everyone's happy.

And let me tell you something,

that woman might not be
the neighbor of the year,

she might not have
the most beautiful house,

and she might have
something seriously stinky

going on with those feet,

but let me tell you,
you know what?

You know who used to hang out
with people with bad feet?

Jesus.
Jenna, am I close?

Lepers, yeah.

And if I'm not mistaken,
Jesus was a carpenter.

Jenna?

Yeah.
Mm-hmm, two-for-two,

so you don't cast any stones,
because as Jesus once said,

"when you're looking
at the dark side,

careful you must be."

That's Yoda.

Oh.

"We are the music makers,
the dreamers of dreams."

No, that's...
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Willy Wonka!
Yeah.

Damn it.

The point is, you guys,

you're looking at that house
and you're seeing an eyesore,

and you should be
looking at the woman

and seeing that
she is missing her husband.

Come on.

We're not meant
to go through this life alone.

Maggie, you got elliott
to take out your garbage,

and Jenna and Pete have
their clean-up day every month,

and Ruby, all she's got

is a whole neighborhood
that's turning against her.

I think we should really
look at that.

I mean, come on,
who are we, guys?

What is Honeysuckle Lane?
Is it a street

that just looks good
from the outside,

or is it a street that
feels good... from the inside?

Excuse me.

Did I overhear you say
you live on Honeysuckle Lane?

You did.

We love that street so much.

Do you know of any homes
for sale there?

No, nope, no.
Oh.

Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

I'm a realtor.
Let me give you my card.

Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, no!
The schools are fantastic.

Are you planning to adopt?
Oh, we love that.

They're spectacular.

Well, you gave it
your best shot.

Yeah, I guess.

Hey, did I tell you
that I figured out

why Ruby smells like feet?

Why?
It's her feet.

That was Pete's theory.

We all thought
it was too simple.

Uh, no, she got
something funky going on

with that toenail.
I don't know. It's either, like,

really ingrown
or looking to escape.

I never thought about it before,
but when you get married,

you agree to a certain level
of personal hygiene.

Well, you gave it
some thought, since you got me

that nose trimmer
on our anniversary.

Well, you gave it thought,

because you give me perfume
every Valentine's day,

reminding me that I am not
supposed to smell like nature.

And thank you for wearing it

those last two weeks
in February.

Message received.

I just...
I don't know what I'd do

if I didn't have you to tell me
that I had food in my teeth

or when I accidentally leave
that tiny piece of toilet paper

in my lady parts.

We promised
never to speak of that,

and yet, you spoke of it.
I'm just grateful, Tom.

I'm grateful
that you helped me out today,

and I'm grateful
for all the days

that you're close enough
to smell me.

Okay, weirdo, get some rest.

After failing
to rally the troops

with my kick-ass sermon
to in the booth,

I woke up feeling
pretty alone.

I don't know
if I would describe

what came next as a miracle,

but it was miraculous.

Oh, I cannot believe it.
You're all here.

Honey, did you do this?

No, this was all you.
Your speech was hot.

I like seeing you
get passionate about old ladies.

Your speech did something.

When we got home last night,
Pete cleaned up the living room,

and I gave him
three special kisses.

Oh, Jenna.

I was swayed
mostly by the Yoda part.

You just ignited
my sense of competition.

I want to be
a better samaritan than you.

Yeah, welcome
to the race.

You people gonna
jibber-jabber all day

or finish the damned house?

Yeah!
Stop your jibber-jabber!

Finish the damned house!

Oh. We did good.

Yeah, you did.

You gonna get out of here,
or am I gonna get the hose?

You want to come over
for a cup of coffee?

I'd like that.

Cool.

Uh, you know what?
I could...

I could help you
with that too.

I learned
that being a good samaritan

sometimes meant doing things
that didn't feel good,

but you knew were right.

Helping a neighbor in need,

setting an example
for others to learn from,

even if they weren't ready
to learn.

Working on your marriage
through good times and bad,

knowing that anything
that has grown ugly from neglect

can be made beautiful again.

You call me
anytime you need me, okay?

You're not alone.

You are a sweet girl.

And to think my daughter
was trying to get me

to move in with her in Florida.

To be honest,
the past few years,

I've only held on to the house
to keep the gays from moving in.
