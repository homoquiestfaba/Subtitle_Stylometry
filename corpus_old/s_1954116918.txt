Come, bring all food.

So, all you find available.

Mole, what level of food now?

I think i thin this year.

Sure we could rephrase.

We are at a dramatically!

We will all die!

No, no, no!
Be optimistic, brothers.

Everything is under control.

Look ... food!

I'm afraid that
it's not edible!

Brilliant!

What is it?

A cart with peanuts?

A cart of peanuts ...

This could be our salvation
for the winter!

Andie!
I left, you will not regret it.

Grayson ... will go with you.

With all due respect, sir,
I can do this myself.

Grayson!

Ole!

Girls like tail!

Help Andie,
to gather as many nuts!

To the park!
To the park!

What she said.

But above all,
Watch the ... I know who.

No! Not him!

Yes ... himself.

Yeah, come to daddy.

Hey, buddy,
I do not know where the bank?

Thank you!

Hey ... moron!

I head crime,
released early </ i>

Hey, sir ...

I want some peanuts!

Off, we closed!

The sign says ... it's open!

Get out!

Heard?
I want peanuts!

You nuts?

You get our hands on those nuts
before we know the whole park.

Let's plan!
That's us, that's the cart.

We rob the wagon and eat
all winter until squished!

What are you watching?

Great!
Company.

Well, we must act.

Get in the bucket!

Officer,
man that attacked me nuts!

Do not listen to him Officer ...

I want to see,
Authorization for sale!

There he is!

It's food that you feed the
Park all winter.

But the dog,
We will do the job more complicated!

Grayson ...

Grayson!?

Quiet!
What are you doing?

Tracks after the scoundrel sniff that.

Though sniff
strange odors!

Gene? Smell of man?

Dog hair!

I knew it!
You stay here!

Honestly, woman! I'm still
hero of this park!

Which makes me wonder,
Why do not you ask me on a date?

I smell a rat!

What are you doing here, Grayson?

Great!

So, would you and I
cart with peanuts?

Of course, the park needs them.

Well, you're late, sis!
Better go!

Me and Buddy, got here first
and they will not share.

Yes, we are in the middle of autumn
and reserves are extremely low that!

Cart that,
We can feed everyone!

Let's work together,
We can make a deal!

Would you give me that?

I do not understand, you can help
entire park, but you did it.

This is your chance to prove,
Raccoon I was wrong about you.

I do not care what you think, Raccoon!

Then do it for the park.
Do not think only of you.

There are independent.
That means I'm number one.

I suggest you do the same,
if you want to survive.

Do you understand?

I'm sorry for you, Surly.

Aha! I found, Andie,
in a tree.

Very clever, Surly.

You should be arrested z?d?rnicirea
assault the wagon with peanuts!

It's okay, Grayson, I understand.
He understood better help her.

Hey, Supergirl ... calm down!

We pull out the tail.

How about you hang out?

Listen, I'd like to stay and chat,
but I have a date with destiny.

Fate? I know her?

Good luck, suckers!

It was fantastic!

That was painful.

This will end badly.

Excuse me, officer.
I saw everything.

Little girl, a little exaggeration.

Not true!

I Understand, officer, she attacked me.
I am innocent ... </ i>

That's not good.

Enjoy your meal!

Hey!
Cart, go!

My cart!
Let's go!

Peanuts!

What a woman!

It will cost you ten percent!

I saved the day?

Grayson, trying to take
how many nuts you!

Hey! What's that smell?

It's my perfume.

Made from tree sap
hawk and tears.

Get back!
Watch the tail, is inflamabil?!

These nuts are ours!

These nuts are mine!

Surly, to negotiate,
must we share the park.

Yes, fair enough.
One hundred thousand and zero to you!

Absolutely not have
clearance for this.

You have to stop the wagon!

Help me!

Surly, help me, my friend!

Damn you, Surly!

Surly, you coward!

Thank you.

Grayson, oak!

We have the result.
Stocat? food in our oak tree ...

There will be enough,
to get out of the winter.

We will die!

Raccoon!

Raccoon holding a speech!

Although the situation seems sumbr? ...
Excuse me!

Andie and Grayson are ...
You listen to me!

This park will go away!
You have courage and hope!

Raccoon!

Andie and Grayson are ...
Quiet ... shut up!

Grayson,
do not let us down yet.

I think it's on the way,
even at this point, bringing ...

A cart with nuts on fire!

What?

Our food will be destroyed!

Why did not you say anything!

Tree, our tree.

My face will be disfigured perfect!

Grayson!

Grayson!

Where are you?

What happened here!

Who's responsible for this?

Let go of me, clowns,
making a big mistake!

I have an alibi, I have witnesses!

I found it hidden like a snake,
in one of our galleries!

Recover buried nuts,
That's what I was doing!

Smells like burnt peanuts?
Or is it me?

What's going on?

Look at this!

You gave this up in winter!

Look at this the camp fire!
I've never seen anything like this, right?

Do not be afraid,
This great body is unharmed!

Raccoon, let me organize
process, just give me the order!

Another process?
Do not shoot ?nv???minte.

It takes a bit more!

He's a real danger.

No!

No, we respect the law,
justice will take care of him.

They will be right, right?
Right, it's what they get.

Raise your hands,
all those who are for banning.

Banished!
Chasing?

Feet?
Yes, please.

Why hesitate,
refused to join us.

He ridiculed our hard work!

He stole, cheated us,
lied to us and now

destroyed our only source
of food for the winter!

To decide!

And ... give up paws.
Why is rising ground in front of me!

We do not condemn without trial,
do not like.

We ran out of options
to squirrel it, Andie.

Do what you want,
Do what is right!

Wait, Buddy did not vote.

Must be unanimous,
that's right!

I will not disappoint?
Right, Buddy?

Buddy?

You were saying?

I assume authority granted Raccoon By </ i>

I and a community park ... </ i>

I is not up ... </ i>

I squirrel Surly,
will be banished to town </ i>

I is not never coming back
in our beloved Liberty Park. </ i>

Now, please, can I get off?

You had to have part of the process, Surly.

Sorry.

That's my punishment, Buddy.

I apple pie mother </ i>

Not so bad!

Dirty rat!

I Look, a rat </ i>

No shoes!

Buddy, Buddy, talk to me!
Come on!

Talk to me, buddy, come on!

How good I feel that I am ...

What are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

Go back to the park!

This is dangerous!

Besides, you're in my way.
I need one.

Look for that squirrel?
And I!

Come on boys, come on, come on,
I love rats!

My best friend
it's a rat!

Forget it!

Come on, come on, come on, you fly!

Come on, Buddy, you got it!

Let's call the boss!

I can not do this!

No food, no home ...
gangs of rats!

I'm dying here, Buddy.

I do not know, maybe I get back.

I work in community service.

I will read marmots blind!

I'll even listen to the Raccoon.

I'll do anything, anything I need a ..

I SHOP FOR PEANUTS </ i>

All right. We go and do not fill bellies.

But ... do it my way!

I do not stuck, cars will be lifted. </ i>

You can forget, Buddy, will not work!

I'll handle this!

Hey, look who's here!
Our boss!

Fresh out of jail!
How did you get out?

How long were you in prison?
8 years, 7 years!

It does not matter! Give me coat!

I No, no, no. I'll take it. </ I>

Hey, Precious, come here!
Say hello to your boss!

Yes! Hey ...

I want you to meet
with our new partner.

Knuckles!

It will be guns and safes expert!

Knuckles,
Say hello to Fingers and Lucky.

Hi, I'm Lucky
welcome aboard!

Nice, dude.

All right.
What genius to find this place!

Me!

Yes ... I was sure.
I found him.

And look what we have here, boss.
We even a cart!

I think ...

It is enough.

I bought it very cheap.
And the place is perfect cover.

And the view too!
Let's get to ...

Plans.

Like I said.
A lot of money.

That's the bank.
The safe is here.

Steel reinforced, solid as a rock.

That's why I brought these little girls.

I go with a "bum"
and go with a prey. </ i>

Turn out the light, come on!

Probably rats!

You said rats?

What's his problem?

Something happened, Fingers?
I got this.

Hear my dog whistle?

You can hear this ...
If talking on tone so tall?

Are you serious?
I have not asked you!

I asked ...

Stop it!

I have enough on my plate and no will.

Boss. Let me show you the basement.

Just if we eat
for the next three days.

Not to mention for the winter.

That's all I can give.

Come on, Grayson!

Five more!
Yes, another five, baby!

It's time for the fun!

All right. That!

Well ...

Let's try last scheme.

Yes, Grayson!

Really think Grayson,
should come with me.

I do not think recovered
after that shot to the head.

Raccoon thinks it would boost morale
in these difficult times.

After all,
Grayson is the hero of the park.

What a champion!

Good luck, honey.

Find food for us.

To the park!

Our hope is in you.

We know you'll find food!

Take me with you!

We have a great time.

Hundred Eighty sun
zero chance of winter!

Take me with you!

Watch!

The city is full of germs
and bright lights!

The sun is coming out.

I have to take refuge
the safety of darkness.

Out of my way!

Goodbye!

Look at us!
We're in a heroic mission!

I think it's the best way
to celebrate our anniversary.

We are not together!

That's an important mission
as to find food!

Right?
You're right.

Let the shit!

Our mission is love.

What scenet? romantic!

I'll take it.

Hello, rodents urban?.
That's scabies or bubonic plague?

Anyway, my lady and me
We thought we could ...

Hey, leave your backpack!
Go back backpack!

The backpack ... Give it back!

Hey!

Grayson!

Leave me!

Retrieve backpack!

Buddy, I ate too much cheese.

I think I will
a baby cheese.

I'm down.

God!

Lana!

God, Lana ...
You look great.

Lana, what a surprise.

You could and you'd call first?

There was no need.

I told your mom
where to find you, King!

Look! E, Lana!

Who are you, monstrule??

It's a fierce bitch, watch.
He does not do very good job.

There is only one.

What does that mean?

Nothing!

What do you mean nothing?
I said ... nothing.

I can not believe it!
But, you've really changed.

Let's talk about second chances
weird.

Yes, but do not tell anyone.

It was given still in folosin??

and we want to make a surprise
the grand opening!

Right, guys?
Not again, you dog!

Hey, my whistle!

You're screwed.

A rat! A rat!

It's in my pants!

We'll be back there on the first occasion
to get our hands on those nuts.

But I can not go back to the park.

Better forget that.

Thing to look glamorous!

Come on!

No, there's nothing here.

Dog stuff
mine!

Surly! What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

Looking to eat!
Looking to eat!

No!
No!

I'm looking for food!
I'm looking for food!

Hey, you find food?

No! Nothing.
You give me that, please?

Why?
What's this?

It's my musical instrument ...

To sing the blues.

I did have friends, I eat, </ i>

I thing has nothing
to do with food. </ i>

I This is a blues for the hungry. </ i>

For God!

You got to eat, right?

And this,
has something to do with it.

It's silly.

Tell me the truth!

I think you've gone crazy.
Pardon my expression!

Surly, I had a bad day.

All food park went.

Grayson crazy
and I've just lost.

I'm hungry and alone
and very cranky.

Start talking or winter
will launch a new coat of squirrel.

Do you understand?

The door!

What? What door?

Nothing, it's just my door,
you're always open.

Must go.
Come back!

Do not lose that thing, right?

Yes!

Buddy, I found it!

The city lost Aluntlantis!

Thanks, buddy.

Sorry for that outburst.
I did not say anything stupid today.

Hey, how much is twenty percent.

I Really </ i>

I Twenty to hundred ... </ i>

Gathering nuts for the winter ...

Very well, listen.

Dig a tunnel
from here to the alley.

And we all take reserves
to get better in winter. Do you understand?

I Twenty out of a hundred,
is twenty percent. You went to school? </ I>

What about it?

Maybe crying
The conditions of this work.

Okay, smarty.
Let's go.

Well, Surly, you'd tell me
What's going on here.

Yes, yes, give me that!

Park's food there, right?

And you have to share it, right?

Never!
OK!

Okay, share.

Whatever.
Fifty-fifty!

Fifty-fifty? I've never shared
fifty-fifty in my life.

Fifty-fifty ...

Fifty-fifty!

We have a deal!

I have four words for you.

Okay!

Thing for dogs.
How about that?

Okay, you win, you win!

Get that thing out of my face!
So can you talk?

Okay, no more talk,
but do not blow the whistle!

I'm not gonna feel sorry for you.
Sure, yeah, I understand.

Wait! Well ...
You can step down.

I'll tell you what happens,
because I seem like a reasonable guy.

If you do not elongate
I will send back to the paddock.

Okay?

And I can not go back there!

Yeah, sure, I believe.

I'm just a victim
the circumstances.

That's not my problem dog.

You're all right?
Do not worry about it.

It's incredible!

It's so much food here, you can
feed park for years!

Hey, wait, wait, what?

We could be friends.
Great.

Come on ...

I can do all sorts of things.

You know ...

I can stay like this ...

Look at this, it's crazy.

It has its own life.

Can I make the dead look.

Now I resurrected, it's incredible!

I dynamite </ i>

Dead and then alive. No?

Duc something to eat in the park!

What?
We have a deal!

I can attack if you want.
I told you to shut up.

The deal's .. I'll take part,
's my take ...

And we split.

I can not take all this
safe in the park.

We need an effective plan!

Good luck with that!

Me and Buddy,
we dig a tunnel!

It's crazy.

No, it's brilliant!

Raccoon and other animals
will go crazy when they hear this.

I'll be back.
First thing tomorrow we start the tunnel.

But that was our deal!

So now appeals.
What? No, wait.

I said I'd work
for the park.

Well, I invite
get back to me if you want.

Who knows?
could you become a hero.

I will return with a team.

Well done, Surly.

No escape from the eye.

You know what I mean!

Hey, boss,
can I lick your face?

Come on, do not be weird.

I propose to make a team
and bring peanuts in the park </ i>

Listen to what I say. </ i>

I sun comes up </ i>

Again the street I us ... </ i>

Wait.
We have to work with Surly.

That's right, we're working with ...

Are you crazy!

We have negotiated a deal with him.
We split everything fifty-fifty.

Have you negotiated?
The Surly?

Are you kidding? He's the reason
for which we do not have peanuts.

No, no, listen up!

We always worked together
and we kept the promises!

We are not wild animals.

These two are animals!

Winter is coming.

If you do not work with Surly
we will not survive.

He saw and Grayson,
Book this nutty?

No, we separated.

Is there any way that Grayson to ...

I do not know if Grayson
will be back again.

Wait, then who will be ...

I made a decision.

Beavers, Mole and Andie
will dig a tunnel to get peanuts.

Mole will be in charge.

Who ... Me?

Though I do not trust Surly,
we will work with him.

Yet.
When peanuts are safe,

we take what's ours.

Do not do business with Surly.

To the park!

Why not do it at night?

Well ...
Let's do it!

Back!

Guys ... Store nuts
was never there.

Allow me.

What do you think the green!

Read my thoughts.

Wait!
I do not know that.

Andie, I'm in charge.
Go ahead, dear.

Wake up!

Move!

I was ready for
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

It's good!

Grayson?

A few days
I'm watching this place.

I have in mind every window
or vent hole.

You want to come in,
to survive the winter ...

Talk ... with me!

We cut the alarm wire tunnel.
When you two get to safe,

You have three minutes to it dinamita?i
and take your money.

Dig here in the alley in the basement.

Why not use the door?

It can not,
a close inside.

Listen carefully.

We fill the vault with bags of peanuts.
I shut down and cross the border.

It will take a few days
until they find out they have peanuts in storage.

Agree?

Agree.
But I do not dig.

Because you're blind as a bat.

What? Who said that, where are you?

What bust talk, boss?

Talk of almonds, peanuts,
pistachios, chestnuts ...

Enough to buy you
a race track.

I mention peanut candy?

Candy ... or peanuts?

Both.

Listen, this is my last shot.

I'm not going to jail that
full of rats.

Did you hear?

That's all we know to do.

I Fire </ i>

I'll kill you!

What happens there?

I's always the same </ i>

I always find the stuff that gray. </ i>

Speak of bricks?

We can speculate
if you are or bricks.

But we can say that this material
has similar properties bricks.

Well, this is it!

I think we have a choice.

I - Wait a minute.
Here is a missing brick </ i>

I do not look like a brick, look good </ i>

I Jimmy!
Jimmy </ i>

I Here is a brick off </ i>

I help me with this, come on </ i>

I together. </ i>

Hey!

It was open all the time?

I do not know, I just got.

Come on, I lick your face?
Lick yourself.

What are those guys?

Digging for bones.
Move!

I That move. </ i>

Okay. I think moving.
Come on. </ I>

Right. You're doing great.
Let him fight next.

J1, I think you are.

Where is Surly?

Hey guys, I found this!
Not that great?

Come on. No! Go!

Let go of the stick that.
It's impossible.

Let go of the stick this!
I do not know how ...

Okay, all right.

Hey, Surly!

What did you eat for breakfast?

You brought peanuts!

I Good job, Surly ... </ i>

I'm dead!

I will send
back to the paddock, I know.

I want to know what to do.

What to do? I do everything you say.
Please ...

What happened here.

What happened?
I want answers!

Guys, look!

Squirrel that tried
to blow up the store.

And Precious stop her!
Can you believe it!

Good girl, good girl!
What about you?

Fix the wall quickly!
I shut the door all the time!

Did you hear?

Repay bitch!

And fix the wall.

That bitch is smart!

Smarter than you.
Smarter than you.

He's smarter than me?

He's smarter than me?

No one is smarter than you!

That's it!

Okay!

We again disagree.

Surly?

What's going on!

This trash basket
has a hole.

We'll use cover
to dig a new tunnel.

Till tunnel people.

No bricks.

That mole was thinking there!

How long will that take?

A day or two. Depends if you do not give
over pipes or stones.

There will be three days!
There will be two days!

Three!
It's ridiculous!

It will not work.
We need his approval Raccoon.

Are you kidding? I think it's Raccoon
going to like the idea.

Yes, Raccoon.
No not here and ruin my life.

I'll tell you one thing.

E contempt on his face.

Raccoon will approve it,
not serious?

Raccoon, guy
is a thief older than me.

But they can not see,
are blind as a marmot.

I'm the brains of this team.

I'm the guy with ... Brain.

I already said that?

Raccoon Mountain is just a skin.

What?

Hey, Surly.
You.

What are you doing here?
Did not have to work on that tunnel?

Are orders of Raccoon.

It's something you should know.

I was totally honest.
Yeah, right.

Raccoon intends
you cheat.

We were all in agreement.

Sorry, but ...

Raccoon always carried my grudge.

And besides ...
Who says you help?

But you help us, right?

I'll help ... myself.

That's right I was wrong.

Remember, Surly,
These nuts park needs.

Do what you have.

I never authorized any ?mp?r?eal?.
Not you?

Do you know Andie,
it was her idea.

Looking for this?

I know Andie.

Not subject
not follow orders.

But I follow the Surly.

You know ... A tamed
even guard dog.

Could even
and to solve our problem.

All day she Surly
will save the park ...

There will be great celebration.

But an accident can happen.

Have you considered sabotage?

What? What are you talking about?
Talk about Surly.

A petty thief garbage.

It's not theft ...

That's about food,
that reaches these animals.

Forgot our motto ...

Animals are controlled
the amount of food they have.

It is our duty
to keep them hungry.

All right.
Where was I?

Yes, to sabotage.

Yes ... sabotage.

What's this? French?

What are you up to, Mole?

Grayson?

Surly?

Surly!

Surly ...
Get your hands.

What's wrong with you?

Everything. I was there
with people and cars.

And cats ... And ... Rat.
A rat!

Keep me.
No, you keep it.

Watch! What are you doing?
I ... drowning.

Buddy, take care of him.

And keep it away
pointy things.

Okay, okay how about this?

Mole! What are you doing?

Wait, wait, it's water?

Let's get out of here!

I take a small zoo.
What you gonna them?

A new partner.
That's it!

Forget it.
Do you hear something?

No.

Dog, dog, open ...

This bird
kill me.

Hello, Lana, no honey,
I can not right now.

What?

You want to pee?
Now ...

No, no, honey, listen ...

What was that?
Mom, are you?

Go up the driveway and stop water.
Turn the water off, I understand.

Hey, you're not my boss!

It seems you are.

I love you ...

Surly, you do?

Shoot that rat.

Kill him!

Quick, where water stops?

It seems it was a rat, boss.

Rats did this?

Find him.

I'm confused. What kind of rat
talk, boss?

There, there it is, the rat!

Good?

You'll both be fine.

Do not tell the others
I and dogs are friends, right?

Does not look good.

That guy needs glasses.

Girl!
You get ...

Surly, you left!
Wait, do not leave me!

Up there, it's a rat crazy.

Grayson?
You are?

I can not believe!
What are you doing here?

He has the face!
Not that his face.

You're the mole?
The liar in the park.

There are baby chicken.

I saw sabotaging tunnel.
Raccoon put you?

Speak!

Let me torture her.
You sit six.

Okay, boss.

Give me what you want.
Come on!

I am a sealed vault.
Resist interrogation.

I'm a hard nut to crack.
A concrete spine.

A jar ...

My eyes!

Raccoon tried
to stop the robbery.

Do not bite it.

Food a little less
means more control.

If you succeed robbery, Raccoon
will lose control of the park.

So what ...
You do not care about the park.

No?
I do not care.

But when I say this team
I get double.

Do you think they believe
a criminal like you.

After all I've done for them?

Of course I will listen.

Yeah, do not lie to yourself.

Dude I was water everywhere. </ i>

Jimmy I suffocate I'm suffocating ... </ i>

And all I saw afterwards,
was Grayson!

He saved my butt.
No, mine!

It was my ass.
Yes?

Stop talking about ass
talk to me.

Grayson ...
Glad you're back.

It was a disaster.

I had to do with Surly.

Surly?

Yes, Surly ...

They think we saved your asses.

Surly!

Watch. Vin.

What happened?
You were not here.

You really wanna know what happened?

It was ... Mole.

I saw him trying
to drown twins.

He confessed everything.

Mole?

Raccoon was his idea.

So I blame the Raccoon,
because you drove out of the park.

No, not true.

Raccoon
we had never done anything wrong.

But he did.

Listen, I want my
and I'm out of here. Okay?

Grayson?
Yes.

Were you there?
Yes.

Where?

You think I was not?
No!

Nobody said that.

Explain yourself.

Buddy, did you see anything?

Wait.
I ask him?

He can not help.
You're wasting your time.

It's useless.
He can not talk.

He knows only
to obey orders.

Just like you, Andie.

So you treat him the only
animal defends you?

No, no, leave him alone.
The tunnel is open.

We take what our morning
and let him take his him.

We can not trust him!

We let him go.
We honor the deal.

Pa, Surly,
come back soon.

I mean, do not come back.
I do not like at all.

Surly, gather the team?
Another robbery.

Not the time now.

Yes, I understand.
Not now.

How about ... now?

I told him no.

The job is done,
ready and the team.

You want to look?

Go back to your people,
I'm on my own.

We play again, right?

No, no, go, run away!
Look what you've done.

I Watch </ i>

What shall we do with him, boss?

Shut.

Go and bring me that lamp.

Lana ...

Glad to see you.

Go check tunnel.

So now you know.

When were you gonna tell me, King?

I already said ...
You can not change what you are.

I Chief, come here. </ i>

Go robbing the bank.

This will be my last shot.

I Chief, come on </ i>

It's a gold mine here,
above our heads.

Let's give this thing in the air.

But Lana?

But ...
No more whistle.

I know.

What have we here?

A hero or a thief?

You think you can starve Park
to keep him under control?

He told me everything, Mole.

What? What are you talking about?

I said nothing.
It jumped.

It's again one of your illusions?

Another revenge
pl?nuit? against me?

It's something else, is not it?

Trying to impress.

Grayson can ...

Andie?

I see ...

It does not matter.

My accomplices will take care of them
very soon.

They do not follow me, hate me.

Maybe, but I can not let
no evidence, Surly.

Any good thief knows that.

It seems a bit absurd, do not you think?

You might want to follow you ...

Where's that shiny thing
that supposedly has it?

Okay, that's it ..

Ten ... new ...

You get the rest when finished
Andie and the others.

Mr. "Hero"
I'll handle it myself.

Park will banish,
will elect new leaders.

How many leaders ... think ...
I can park?

Three ... two ...

One '!

He will warn the others.

What are you waiting for?
After him!

Bingo, guys.

Look at all this money!

Put the money in the truck.
Let's get out of here.

You two ...

Put peanuts in the vault.
See you later.

What do you get your money?

A pet?

I take three pets.
And I d?ruiesc to you two of them.

And a pony.
Do not forget the pony ...

Dearly them.
They're beautiful and gentle.

Another one.

What's going on?

I told them to put peanuts in the vault.

Yes? Then you put
car of the tunnel?

What are you playing?

What game do you?

Relax.
They pushed the car out.

Or maybe they were ...

Rats!

God!

Take care!
I'll take care of these rats.

Squirrel!

Get out.

And you,
what you gonna do?

I told you to leave.

Everything was perfect.

Grayson, you're an idiot.

Surly, I must disguise.

Into something spectacular.

Cut the crap.

Go team in the tunnel
And Run by sp?rtur?.

I distract him guy.

I need skates,
a mustache and maybe a crank.

You do not need cloak.

I can not help yourself park.
I'm not a hero.

But you are.

Last summer,
in that the heat wave ...

Who discovered sprinklers
and everyone had water?

I?
Yes, it is!

They believe in heroes.

So, act like a hero.

Time for heroes.

Time for heroes!

Why do you fear me?

The rats!

Rats!
Run, save your life!

Grayson?

He comes to save us!

This is our chance.
Let's go!

Mole, what are you doing here?

Andie.
Thank God you're here.

Raccoon?

Surly planning
betray us all.

He confessed to everything.
What?

He said you and Mole
You tried to drowned the beavers.

But
He works for Surly.

What do I do?

Will you stop doing that?

Jimmy, Johnny ...

Go to the park
and bring more help.

Yes, sir.

Get out of the way!
Me first.

Get the rest of the truck nuts.

To the park!

To the park!
Come on, guys.

I do not want to tell me
how to spend my money. </ i>

Look at it, Buddy!

Celebrate later.
The truck can go anytime.

Let's fight!

Raccoon, sorry
that I doubted you.

Raccoon I open the door </ i>

Better go.

That will not change the plan.

Fantastic!

What? It's weird!

We go to the left.

We need to get everybody,
out of the truck.

Look for a way to enter.
Follow me.

I put it!

I did it!
Yes.

It was strangely easy.
I'm going to take a look.

What?

I'm just nuts?

We were tricked!
What?

There is no money.
Rat bastards!

A squirrel.

It's a squirrel ...

And a bird?

It looks like they realized.

It's time to end it
this little charades.

Turn.

I can not see.

At left, now!

Annual contest cat I </ i>

Can I do it. </ i>

Try again.

We need Grayson!

Grayson, you there?

Do not worry,

Thank you, thank you!

Mole. Do not play
and help us to open this door.

Grayson, pushing me.

Grayson came to save us!

Let me explain ...

Wait a second ...

Leave him. The door is open.
We push the peanuts out.

Raccoon?

Go ahead, asshole.

Help me throw him,
otherwise we will kill them all.

To kill us?

That squirrel ... is a hero.

Almost hero, actually.

Raccoon,
is a fucking traitor.

He's a traitor.

Hang on, Mole!

What do I do?

Why have you locked up here?

Waste time.

That's the only time
get rid park guy.

To the park!

Still have not answered my question.

That's treason.
No, Andie?

Answer the question, Raccoon.

Surly, told us the truth?

Answer it!

Vote, agreed.

Raise your hands,
those guys for evacuation.

Yes, shiny thing.

Stay calm until we cross the border.
And then we'll be free.

You're the thief, not Surly.
He was right about you.

No, no, no.
We dynamite there.

Well boys, you're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

Get out, now!

I knew this would happen.

No, did not know.

Mole, where are the others?

Still there.

But Andie
is in the other car with Raccoon.

You can not stop yourself.

Surly, I'm talking!

I just wanted a pet.

You will not get away with this.

I want my pony.

They took hostages.
Wait.

God ...

I bet it was that squirrel.

No more squirrels!

Andie? Andie?

Surly?

Andie? Andie?

Can I still save money. </ i>

What are you gonna do?
Are ? lot of money.

What are you trying to prove, Surly?

Raccoon's unstable.

What is this.
Tell me.

Buddy!
Great friend.

Surly. Give it to me.

Not so fast, thief.

Look!

Surly and Raccoon.

They fall into the waterfall.
Come all.

Come on!

Gotcha!
Do not let go.

Raccoon, jump.

But you can save them both.
Hurry!

I never make a deal
worms traitors.

Surly falls to me.
Buddy ...

What great adventure!
Almost there.

Surly, you do not dare
I let him go.

Sorry, Andie.

What?
No!

Surly not!

What's this?

Look!

E, Grayson!

Thank you, thank you.

Do not worry, I'm fine.

We arrive at the park
and I give autographs.

Jump out!

Do not be afraid!
Grayson?

And you're here?

Hello!

Come on, guys!

Rats ...

A lot of rats!

Officers, save me!

Get me out of here, officer.

Get me out of here.

Save me from these rats.

Percy King, you are a fool.

You and I are done.

Precious ...

Precious?

What are you staring?

Wait, Buddy.
I can not ... speak.

Well, well, well.
Enough.

Precious!

Well, Surly ...

Wait, what? There?

Yes.
Lana's new owner.

And no more whistles.
Only lins?turi.

Hi, Andie!

Surly!

When you fell in the waterfall,
I thought I'll never see.

You go, come on!

Relax.
Where are we going?

You risked your life
as to save this park.

You know all.

Do not ...
The team saved the park.

I do not touch the tail,
Stop. </ i>

What will you do now?

I will continue to look for food
