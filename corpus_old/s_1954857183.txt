Gentlemen, eyes to the front!

Pick your targets.

Private, my new tunic.

Gentlemen, prepare for war.

Stand at ready!

And...

Charge!

Charge!

Oh, yeah. Give it to her. Yeah.

Oh, I love it.

Timeout. Reload!

All right, girls. Take 10.

Hmm.

Heh!

I did everything

back in the seventies.

And then I did it again
in the eighties,

just to make sure I still could.

I mean, after all
that coke, right?

What do you mean? Like, orgies?

You kidding me?

Back in the day,

I lived with five,
six models at a time.

And the sex.

What can I say?

What can I say?

I was born in the era
of free love.

Let freedom ring.

You know what Tony Curtis
once said to me?

He said, "I dove into the swimming
pool at the ambassador hotel.

When I got out,
it was 30 years later."

Live for today, my friend,

'cause tomorrow,
you're gonna get fucked.

â™ª You have been all your life â™ª

â™ª Wishing well for everyone â™ª

â™ª Don't look back, step aside â™ª

â™ª You deserve a second chance â™ª

â™ª Time is right â™ª

â™ª Fix your hair

â™ª change your face â™ª

â™ª Change your face â™ª

â™ª Prepare for torture â™ª
â™ª in your mind â™ª

Mr. ward.

What were you thinking?

Hello.

Hey. Is this
wade ward photography?

Yeah, that's me.

I want to hire you for a job.

Okay. Tomorrow.

Great.

Hello.

Hello.

Hello?

Photographer.

All right, I want--
Come on. Turn around.

Turn around again.

This time, you're running away.

Running away. It's cheesy.

Running away. It's cheesy.

All right, that's it. That's it.

Now come on. I need you in the light.
Move over here.

Attagirl. Hold it.

All right. Now slip
down ever so slowly.

Attagirl. Attagirl.

There you go. All right.

Give me some-- give me
some baby pink now.

Ah, beautiful.

All right, now.

Both fingers, darling.

That's it. Hold it right there.

Hold it.

All right, reload.

Socko, what the hell
are you looking at?

Reload my camera.

All right.

All right, girls, take 10.

Courtney, no smoking.

I don't want
to be cleaning the red

out of your eyes
for the next hour.

Are you the photographer?

Uh, yeah.

Wade ward.

What was that?

Wade ward.

Wade ward. I like that.

Kind of sounds like a superhero.

Wade ward.

Wade ward.

Stewart fox.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

What?

Oh.

You weren't expecting to see all
the tits and ass, were you?

Hmm? Hmm?

No.

All right, get out of here,

You harlots!

I want to speak to this
young man in private.

Great.

You like what you see, wade?

Make yourself at home, wade.

Would you care for a mai
tai or a glass of wine

would you care for a mai
tai or a glass of wine

or--or perhaps a snort of coke?

Let me over!

Asshole!

So what's your story, kid?

I'm a photographer from L.A.,

grew up in old Hollywood.

L.A., huh? Yeah.

Cool.

Me, I was born in a
shithole in Brooklyn,

got the fuck out and hitched
out here when I was 17,

you know? Sunset strip.

You know? Sunset strip.

Surf's up, baby.

Yeah.

You surf?

No. What?

An L.A. kid who doesn't surf?

Heh. What's the matter, kid?

You never got enraptured
by the beach boys?

'Cause I know
I sure as fuck did.

Hey.

Well, wade,

what I'm looking for
is a photographer

who can shoot some
behind-the-scene photographs

for me for my book,

"the world's greatest
erotic photographer ever."

"The world's greatest
erotic photographer ever."

Nice. Okay.

What?

Did you think you were gonna
be shooting a family portrait?

No. No. I just--yeah.

I don't know. I'm sorry, man.

My head's just
all over the place.

Um, I can do that.

You're a good
photographer, right?

Mm-hmm.

Well, if you're a photographer,

then I'm sure you're familiar
with both my name and my work.

Heh. Man, I'm sorry.
I gotta be honest.

Before I came in here,
I had no idea who you were.

Honest. I like that.

Honest. I like that.

Let me show you something, kid.

Here you go.
Take a look at these.

Go on.

There's a lot of money
to be made

in erotic photography. Nice.

And I am the world's

most published
erotic photographer.

That's why Donna came up
with the idea for the book.

How old are you, wade?

Uh, 21.

21. Great age.

Echo, Courtney, this is wade.

Echo, Courtney, this is wade.

He's gonna be working
with us for a few shoots.

Nice. He's cute. Hi.

Yeah, well, don't suck the life

out of him yet, darling.

We need him.

Well, if everybody's all right,

let's just get started.

All right.

Here you are, wade.

What's this?

It's some lube.

It makes it all
so much more inviting.

Well, why don't they do it? Eww.

Because they get
their hands sticky.

I thought that I was just
shooting pictures for your book.

I thought that I was just
shooting pictures for your book.

You are shooting
pictures for my book,

but first you oil the harlot.

I'm a photographer.
I take pictures, okay?

I don't--that's it.

Come on, wade. It's easy.

You take a q-tip,
you dip it in the lube,

and you apply it to the cooze.

And we never
double-dip the cooze.

Heh. We never
double-dip the cooze.

I don't like "cooze." Why?

Call it a yammy.

Call it a yammy.

Yammy, yammy, yammy.

Ooh, yammy, yammy, yammy.

I tell you what.
Henceforth and forever,

I shall call it a yammy.

I shall call it a yammy.

Wade, would you be so kind
as to apply the lube

to echo's yummy yammy?

Come on, lube monkey.
I need lube.

The lube monkey! Come on, wade.

I can't work like this.

I hereby dub you knight,
herr wade.

Just get in there,
and slap it on, buddy.

Well, why don't you have
your assistant do it?

Oh, you don't think he
would jump at the chance?

I'd rather be shooting pictures.

Do I have to do
everything myself?

Give me that.

All right. That's it, baby.

Mmm.

There. That ought to do it.

There. That ought to do it.

I'm the king. All right?

Now, whatever
the king says goes.

That's the price you pay
for the gig, you know?

Yeah.

So, how long do I
have to cooze yammies

before I can take some pictures?

Hmm.

You really are a trip, wade.

Listen, you don't
cooze yammies, okay?

Yammy is a cooze. Wh--

I want you to forget
all that shit, all right?

You're gonna get
your chance to shoot,

you're gonna get
your chance to shoot,

but you're gonna
have to be patient.

I like that picture over there.

You know, I'm actually working
on a series of--of photos myself

with the precept of--of
godlessness versus illumination

and them coming together.

That's a great picture.

Who took that picture?

I did.

Wait a second.
You took that picture?

Wait a second.
You took that picture?

Screw you, kid,

and all your
artsy-fartsy bullshit.

Let me tell you something.

I earned my bones the hard way,

and so will you,
if you ever get 'em.

I worked for five years
for "wanker" magazine,

for that prick Saul goldspan.

All right? I did everything,

and I'm talking about
I drove his car,

I was a gofer, a bodyguard,

a drug absconder, you name it,

before I got to shoot
one fucking picture,

so I don't want to hear any of
your fucking complaints, kid.

What's this? Hmm?

This was in our bedroom.

This filthy, wet,
germ-ridden towel

this filthy, wet,
germ-ridden towel

was strewn across my
500-thread-count pillowcase.

Welcome to my world, wade.

Wade, this is Donna.

Donna, this is wade,
the photographer.

He thinks he's
Andy fucking warhol.

Well, that's great.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

What do you think
of all of this?

Uh, it's, uh--
It's interesting.

I've been
showing wade the ropes.

Yeah. Yeah, I bet you have.

Has he got you
cleaning toilets yet?

Not yet, but close.
You stand up to him.

He's a softy at heart
when he's not drinking.

Anyway, I'm gonna give
you my email address.

Anyway, I'm gonna give
you my email address.

Send me everything
that you shoot.

I want you to shoot him
with all the models.

And, stew, you shoot in the
master bedroom again, babe,

and I'm gonna
cut off your balls.

Whiner, party of one,
your table is ready.

Welcome to showbiz, kid.

Ah, wade,
you don't lube yammies.

How do you feel
about answering doors?

Hmm?

Oh. Well, then, I'll go
answer the door, then.

Oh. Well, then, I'll go
answer the door, then.

At last a member of the kingdom.

Hi.

Um, I'm Heather.

I mean, uh, queenie.

Yeah, the seal must have broke.

I can see that.

Oh!

Um--
I'm sorry!

I'm wade.

Hi. Um, I'm here
for Stewart fox.

Yeah?

Yeah?

Um, um,

I'm shooting with him tomorrow.

I'm here for some test shots.

Follow me. Um...

I like your name, queenie.

Thanks, um, wade.

I love you, Courtney.

Heh. Thank you.

And, echo,

I couldn't even begin
to focus my camera

without those
blue eyes, darling.

Hi.

Ah, you must be queenie.

Look at you.
You're such an angel.

Queenie, this is
Courtney and echo,

queenie, this is
Courtney and echo,

major adult-film stars.

Hi. Hi. Hi.

Major. I see you've met wade.

What's this?

Somebody return their champagne?

It says, "no, thanks."

Ah, it must be that crazy
woman from across the street.

You know, she digs holes
all through the night.

Probably burying a body
or something.

Oh, and the seal was broke.
I didn't open it.

Well, waste not,
want not, I say.

Yeah, pass it.

Courtney, germs.

Socko!

Get us some champagne glasses!

I believe I'll test it first.

I believe I'll test it first.

Mmm. That's good. That's good.

This is the way to start a day.

Probably burying
a body or something.

"The world's greatest
erotic photographer..."

"Ever."

"Ever."

That stuff is disgusting.

All right, mount up,
you dirty bitches.

We're not done here yet.

We're gonna do a bunch
of blow-job shots

with Courtney and a strap-on.

Blow jobs, really? Again?

What's your problem, Courtney?

Nothing, but are we
taking photos,

or are we putting on
a fucking show?

What the hell's the difference?

What is this, "mutiny
on the fucking Booty?"

Get on the set. Hey, Stewart.

Why don't I take some test shots

of queenie in the other room?

Ah, that's a good idea, wade.

Ah, that's a good idea, wade.

Why don't you take some test shots
of queenie in the other room?

Use the polaroid,
and shoot in the kitchen.

It's all right.
I got my digital.

Well, if everyone's done
bitching and moaning,

can we get started?

Echo, would you be so kind
as to get on your knees

and mystify the planet?

Oh.

I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

Who cares, right?

Go over to that window.

Yeah.

Are you nervous?

No, I'm ready.

All right.

Mm-hmm. There we go. Perfect.

No, I wasn't even
smiling for that one.

No, that was the best one.
Trust me.

And relax.

There you go.

Turn your face into the
light a little bit.

Just a little bit.

Yeah, right there.

Yeah, right there.

Okay.

Nice.

Now get on that bed right there.

And don't smile for this one.

Why? Am I messing it up?

No, you look gorgeous.

Wade!

I gotta go.

I gotta go.

Okay. Wade!

Um, you know what? It's
my first and last day,

so I don't know if I'm
gonna see you again.

Okay.

Uh, bye.

Um, it was nice
to meet you, though.

Good luck.

Thanks.

â™ª Boy behind closed doors â™ª

â™ª No truth... â™ª

â™ª No truth... â™ª

Wade, you want a beer?

Yeah.

So what's the deal
with the champagne?

Well, Donna and I throw a
party every now and then.

You know, it smoothes out
with the neighbors.

Oh, yeah? Cool party?

Cut the small talk, kid.

Wow. She looks good there.

Yeah, she's beautiful.

Yeah, we'll see
how she does tomorrow.

Hey, wade. Hmm?

You remember when Donna said not
to film in the master bedroom?

You remember when Donna said not
to film in the master bedroom?

You know? So when I say

film in the kitchen,
you do that, okay?

All right. Yeah?

Your work looks promising.

Thanks. Hey, socko!

Get the vacuum,

and clean out the master bedroom
before Donna gets home!

I trust no other cleanup
will be necessary.

No, no, no, no, no.
No. It's all good.

Really? Yeah? Yeah.

How you like being
in the porn business?

I'm not in the porn business.

I'm just taking pictures of
a guy in the porn business.

Yeah? I used to be you.

Yeah? I used to be you.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah. Heh.

You need some money?

Nah, I'm good.

Heh.

I'm gonna enjoy
corrupting you, wade.

We'll see.

Well...

Have a good night, maestro.

Maestro?

I like that.

That's a sign of respect.

All right, then.

Hey. It was nice to meet you.

Yeah. Hey...

You want to smoke some weed?

Sure.

Cool.

Yeah, I've only had

maybe three real boyfriends
in my whole life.

I've only had a couple
serious girlfriends.

I've only had a couple
serious girlfriends.

But I've never even
really been out,

like, on a traditional,
like, date. Heh.

Dates are overrated.

Mm-hmm.

Traditional ones, anyway.

My ex-boyfriend and I...

We never even made out,
like, for real,

unless it was on film.

Heh.

Fuck.

I wonder how long
that guy's been there.

I wonder how long
that guy's been there.

Is he always around here?
I don't know.

Do something with that.
Yeah, he's around here a lot.

Relax. You relax.

Put that in there.

Just relax. I'll walk
you to your car.

How you doing?

Good. Hi. Good.

Is there a problem?

We're just heading home.

No. No, no problem.

Nice night, though, right?

Yeah. Just got off work.
Just going home.

Yeah. Just got off work.
Just going home.

Oh, really? What do
you do for a living?

Model, like, actress.

Model-actress.

Yeah. I'm actually
kind of famous.

You're famous? Wow.

Really? Heh.

I'm wade, by the way.

Wade. Yeah.

Right. I'm Christian.

I mean, th's my name, not the...

Christian, the cop.

Ah. Pays to advertise, right?

I'm Courtney.

Courtney. Is that with a "c"?

C-o-u-r-t.

I like it. Thanks.

I like it. Thanks.

Mm. A model. Yeah.

Wow. Don't meet many models.

Yeah. What's up with that, eh?

I don't see very many cops.

Well, that's a good thing.

Yeah. Good girl.

Well, I'm gonna head home.

You guys have a--
Have good night.

It was nice to meet you.
Okay, wade.

Good to meet you. Bye, wade.

Take care.

Thank you, my dear.

Thank you, my dear.

Sublime, as always.

â™ª We make beginnings â™ª

â™ª Till we take their end â™ª

â™ª Now we do it again, ah â™ª

Look, you're asking
for a freebie, Wally,

and I don't do freebies.

Look, why don't you get

one of your digital
wonders to do it?

Bye.

Hey, wait a second.

I want to talk to you.

Because I'm not gonna work for
that kind of money, shylock!

Because I'm not gonna work for
that kind of money, shylock!

Why? Because that's the
money I made in 1978, dude.

Stew, I gotta go.

Where you going?

Just running some errands.

Oh, errands. Great.

Look, I've wasted enough time
on this phone call today.

You call me back when you have

the right-sized envelope.

Good morning, my liege.

So glad you could make it.

Hey, wade. I loved the
photos you emailed me.

You've got an amazing
eye for composition.

Oh, thank you.

You know what?

You could learn something
from this kid, big boy.

You could learn something
from this kid, big boy.

Ah, thank you, nut
grinder extraordinaire.

Hey, he's the maestro,

not me. Ah.

Brownnosing will
get you everywhere, wade.

So, um, listen, the other
day, you offered me

some cash up front for the
job I'm doing for you.

And I recall you turned me down.

Guilty.

But listen, um,
I kinda changed my mind,

so if that's cool with you...

That's good. Why don't you come
see me at the end of the day?

You ready to shoot today?

Absolutely.
All right. Get ready.

All right. I'll see you on set.

All right.

All right.

Socko, get the fucking door!

Hi!

Hi. Heh.

Hello, my petite wonder.

I think I'm gonna go run
those errands later on.

Mm-hmm. Ria. Yes, sir?

Run queenie through the works.

I expect to be shooting
in 20 minutes.

What now?

Let's go, your majesty. Hello.

Heh. You gotta be kidding me.

I would never go to cabo
with you, asshole.

I would never go to cabo
with you, asshole.

Hey, socko!

Lovey?

Lovey? Here, kitty, kitty...

Kitty. Oh.

You're not lovey.

No.

It's your nephew, Chris.

I know that, silly.

I love it when you
come to see me.

I love it when you
come to see me.

Just stopped by to, uh--

To bring some groceries,
uh, aunt Gloria.

Thank you, sweetheart.

So you, uh, got your good
cologne on again today,

<i>eau de</i> vermouth.

Shucks.

You know, you gotta
be careful, Gloria.

You get in your car,

get in an accident or,
worse, kill somebody,

it's--it's just bad.

Well, that's just silly.

Well, that's just silly.

Yeah. I suppose it is,

since you never
leave this house.

Hey, let me make you
some tea and cookies.

That's okay. Gloria, I--
No, no.

I--I made some sugar cookies

just for you. See--

Aw, shit.

Oh.

They're not sugar cookies.

They're brownies.

Hmm.

You like brownies, huh?

You like brownies, huh?

Yeah, I like brownies.

Okay. Let me just...

Let me help.

Pick these up and--
No, I'll do it.

It's all right. I--I really
do have to go, aunt Gloria.

No, don't go. Let me fix you

a cup of nice, hot tea
and brownies and--

Okay? Don't--don't go.

Okay. I'll--
I'll stay for one cup.

Shut that fucking dog up, socko!

Shut that fucking dog up, socko!

Oh, eat my crusty shorts,
faggot.

I am famous for my skin tones.

Nervous?

Why? 'Cause I'm smoking?

Hey, man, six months ago,

you asked for pissing!
It's urination, Ronnie!

Nah, 'cause you're
biting your lip.

Goddamn, scum-sucking,
fucking neanderthal!

Fun? Yeah.

Donna, I haven't had fun
since I snuck in

to Woodstock when I was 14.
Oh, god.

To Woodstock when I was 14.
Oh, god.

Somebody's gotta pay

for the house that porn built!

If I don't give 'em what
they want, I don't get paid.

How 'bout this one, wade, huh?

The fox family locked
in connubial bliss.

Stewart, you asshole!

I am the king of assholes!

You used to love what you did,
and so did everybody else.

Yeah, and what the hell
do you want from me?

This is my life
or what's left of it.

What? Oh. You want detachment.

Well, how's this for detachment,

you pretentious cocksucker?

Yes. All right.

Now give me just
a little bit more.

Now give me just
a little bit more.

That's it, honey. That's it.

Yes. All right.

Now give me a little more.

You want more of this?

That's why I'm here, baby.

Gotta take care of you.
It's your virgin shoot.

Oh, I'm a virgin?

You know who you
remind me of, queenie?

Who?

You remind me
of my future ex-wife.

Ria. Yeah?

Could you get in there

and straighten out
her makeup, honey?

Okay. Done. Done.

All right, sweetheart.

I want you to concentrate, okay?

I'm trying.

Try harder, okay?

Roll over.

"Roll over."

Am I a model or a terrier?

Are you leaving?

Yeah. Yeah.

I think I've, uh, seen enough.

You sure you don't
want to stick around?

Maybe we could have dinner
together for a change.

No. No, no, no.
I've got things to do,

and if I go,
you can concentrate.

And if I go,
you can concentrate.

All right.

I know.

I smell the blood...

Of a wirgin.

Heh heh.

There you go.

Am I doing good? Uh-huh.

That didn't sound
very convincing.

All right.

Just spread your legs

just a little bit. Huh.

Just a little bit. Huh.

Okay.

Wider.

Wider.

So, uh, where you staying?

In a hotel.

So, you ever do any films?

No. Heh.

What hotel?

What hotel?

Look, I would never do a porno.

I'm not a whore. I--I know.

I'm just saying,
you know every photographer

is gonna try to get you
to do something different,

you know, something you
haven't done before.

Oh, really? Yeah.

You know, first it's fingers.

Then it's toys.

Then it's girls and boys.

Then, you know,
next thing you know,

you got a saddle on
and a harness,

and you're fucking a dog.

Whoa, bro. I didn't
sign a release for that.

That's it. That's it.

That's it. That's it.

Am I doing this thing right?

Absolutely, but I need
a little penetration.

Two fingers, all right?

I don't do two fingers.

Oh, come on. Just a little, hmm?

Come on.

All right. How much?

This much. Hmm?

I'm just kidding.

You know what I don't need?

I don't need your fat butt

telling me to stick
my fingers in my coochie!

I'm going to the bathroom.

Come on, come on, come on.

Where the hell are you going?

You're so photographable
like this. Heh.

You're so photographable
like this. Heh.

Oh, this is insane.

Socko, I need you to give
this girl a ride home.

I don't think things
are gonna work out.

Sure. Okay.

I can do it.

You sure? Yeah.

Sorry.

Sorry.

Uh...

Ah.

Thanks.

So do you want
to get some dinner?

Or maybe a drink?

I don't know.

Yeah. Um, cool.

Yeah. Um, cool.

Okay.

â™ª 256 megabytes of love â™ª

â™ª I downloaded your heart â™ª

Oh, my god.

I'm so tired.

Did you like the first day?

Uh...

Uh...

Yeah. It was...

Fun, I guess.

Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.

You know that guy who was
helping with everything?

Socko? Yeah.

Um, did you know that he
followed me to the bathroom?

What?

Mm-hmm. He, um--

He licked my arm.

Eww! Gross! Ahh!

That dirty bastard.

Think he'll sell those photos?

Oh, for sure.

Yeah, part of me hopes
that they won't sell.

Is that weird?

You know that you're
a model, right?

Yeah.

And you're incredibly beautiful.

I just didn't plan

on being this kind of a model.

Still,

I didn't want to be
showing everything.

I didn't want to be
showing everything.

Then why'd you do it?

I need the money.

Yeah, don't we all?

Don't we all?

â™ª Well... â™ª

Ah...

Home, sweet home.

I like it.

â™ª I see my girl... â™ª

Yeah. It has
a certain charm to it.

You drink this?

Not, like, regular.

It's really, really awful.

It burns my throat.

Bottoms up.

I also have this, if...

You want to--
I don't know.

â™ª I see my girl â™ª

â™ª I see my girl â™ª

â™ª Watch me over there... â™ª

I only need one hit.

You look like a dragon.

One-hit wonder.

You're faded.

Look at you.

Oh.

Put it on.

Look up.

See?

Uh-huh. Wait.

Come here.

I'll do you. No.

Yes. Mm-mm.

Mm-hmm. I don't think so.

Come on.

I don't think so.

You have beautiful eyes.

I love it when men wear makeup.

I don't know about this.

It looks really sexy.
You'll see.

Mm. Shh.

My mom used to do this for
me when I was little.

My mom used to do this for
me when I was little.

Get to play dress-up.

She used to take me
shopping all the time.

Hmm.

We'd just...

Look in the windows.

Your mom, was she--

That is perfect.

You're gorgeous, really.

Let's see.

Look.

You ready?

Are you ready?

Smile for the camera.

Not like that.

Smile again.

You're a natural. Hmm.

Mm-hmm.

All right. My turn.

That's enough. What?

I want your fucking nipple hard.

Okay?

Do something. Tweak them.

Courtney, bite it.

You asked for it.

Socko! Ice!

Socko! Ice!

That's it, honey. Like that.

â™ª I see my girl â™ª

â™ª Look so beautiful tonight... â™ª

Give me just a little bit more.

â™ª I see my girl... â™ª

The finger.

Spread 'em. Wider.

Wider!

That's it. Go for the pink.

You know, in--
In stew's studio...

Uh-huh. Yesterday...

Uh-huh. Yesterday...

All right, my little Petunia,

how do you like that?

Huh?

Eh, you like that, don't you?

All right.

Yeah?

I thought you were...

Well...

You were, weren't you?

Mm-hmm. Yes.

Mm-hmm. Yes.

Hold that.

And...

You're such a slut.

When?

What?

I disgust you, don't I?

No, you don't.

Well, I do, in this.

It's not the--
I'll just take it off!

Fine. Here!

Is that better? Here!

â™ª Whaah â™ª

Hey, queenie, what--

Is this about the clothes?

What is this about?

Sorry. I can't.

I don't understand.

I want to know
what this is about.

I'm sorry. I just--
I can't...

What?

I can't.

Hey, are you okay?

Just stop.

Hey, where is everyone?

Ah, stew's on the phone,

and, uh, Ria took
a higher-paying gig.

Really?

Yeah. Stew's really pissed.

Huh.

Fucking choke you out.

Where's the model?
Are you the model?

Yeah.

No, she's in the bathroom
putting on her makeup.

I'm going out.

I made some--
Of course I did, asshole!

That's what you asked me to do!

Is that about queenie?

No. Yeah.

I mean, they love her.

I mean, they love her.

It's just that they want more.

You're a fucking moron.

And of course they're
really pissed off with stew,

because he keeps using
the same wardrobe and props.

What the fuck
is socko doing here?

I thought he fired him.

Well, he did, but he
couldn't find a replacement,

so I guess he figured fuck it.

Queenie's not here.

Listen to me, you little prick!

I was the center of the
universe in my field

while you were squawking

and sucking on your
mother's fat tits!

<i>Y con</i> yo' <i>madre, y</i> yo' <i>puta.</i>

Fuck!

Fuck!

I switched to digital
for these cocksuckers!

What are you laughing at?

It--it's funny, stew.

It's funny?
Now you're standing there

with a stupid fucking
grin on your face?

I mean, what the fuck
is that about?

What the fuck goes on in that sicko,
socko fucking brain of yours?

Stew!

What the fuck?

I know what you're doing,
you little fuck.

You've been jerking off while
everybody else is out here

trying to make something decent
out of this fucking shit.

Trying to make something decent
out of this fucking shit.

Stew! Stop with this crazy--

Get the fuck out
of here right now,

you little fucking shit!

Why are you doing this?

You are acting like a crazy man!

Look, I run my ship
the way I want to, Donna.

Nobody touches one of my
girls inappropriately.

That is not the point.

You are scaring everybody
with these crazy tirades!

Who the fuck am
I scaring, Donna? Huh?

Wade, you scared? Huh?

Right. Like--
All right, that--

That's it! Shoot's canceled!

Right. Well, I am out of here!

Right. Well, I am out of here!

Fine. <i>Sayonara,</i> bitch.
What else is new?

Shoot's canceled,

but if you'd like, um,
you could stay for a swim.

Hey, it's wade.

Um, I wish that I could take
you away from all this stuff.

He's a bit of a scumbag,

and, uh--and I'm definitely
not leaving this message,

and, uh--and I'm definitely
not leaving this message,

because that's
fucking god-awful.

Hey, it's wade. Give me a call.

â™ª 1, 2, 3, 4 â™ª

â™ª 1, 2, 3, 4 â™ª

â™ª 1, 2, 3 â™ª

Hi.

Hi.

Um...

Oh, thanks.

Yeah, that's what
I was looking for.

Sorry. I was sleeping.

Yeah, I can tell.
Go back to bed.

No, um, you can come in. Yeah?

I was just gonna get up
and smoke a bowl anyway.

Okay. Come on.

You sure? Mm-hmm.

All right.

I can't believe that
you travel with a bong.

I can't believe that
you travel with a bong.

That's hilarious.

Now you gotta hit it. No.

It's going already.
You gotta go.

What? You can't let it stop.

Do it.

Go! Take it.

Go! Go! Go! Come on.

You're out of your mind.

You can do it.

Be strong.

Oh!

So, what are you up to today?

I'm supposed to be
working with Stewart.

I'm supposed to be
working with Stewart.

What, did you quit or something?

No. Oh, he got into, like, a
full-on brawl with socko.

Really? Well, it wasn't
like a full-on brawl.

But he definitely smacked him,

so I'm gonna have
to cancel the shoot.

I think that guy, like, left
me a message on my phone.

He's the weird one
who licked me, right?

Yeah. Oh, he smacked him.

Like double bitch-slapped him.

Shut up. He smacked
him one for real?

One? He smacked him,
like, four times.

No. Yeah.

He was, like, bam!

"I know what you're doing.
You're jerking off."

"I know what you're doing.
You're jerking off."

Bam!

Who broke it up? Donna?

Yeah.

Oh, my god. What did you do?

I was taking pictures.

Of course. Right.

You're funny.

You're funny.

No, you're funny. You're funny.

Your face is funnier than--

Stop!

Sorry.

I want to live in Hollywood.

You shouldn't smoke those.

You shouldn't smoke those.

So, hey, how do you, um--

How do you become an actor?

Mm, I don't know.

You, uh--
You get head shots

and send them
to agents, I guess.

But how do I get those?

I could take 'em.

Really? Mm-hmm.

Seriously? Yeah.

Really? No, I'm lying to you.

Oh, my god!

I would totally
kiss you right now,

but my tongue feels
like it has fur on it.

Mmm.

Where are you going?

I'm going to get my camera.

So Cleopatra's rolling over
in her grave right now.

Drop your chin.

Okay.

Put your hair behind your ear,

like that.

Ahem. Okay.

Shit.

Shit.

That's pathetic.

Stupid.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey, you.

Hey. Hi.

Courtney, the famous model.

Chris, the cop.

You remembered. Yeah.

Yeah. Hi.

Hi. I was, uh--

I was hoping that I
would see you again.

So what brings you
around here today? You--

I kind of work here. Duh.

Oh, you--
You work--

I work. Duh. You--yeah.

I work. Duh. You--yeah.

Heh. That was really shitty.

I shouldn't have said that.

I'm sorry. Um... That's okay.

Do you want to--
I don't know--

Do something sometime or not?

You mean like lunch? Yeah.

Well, yeah. Yeah. Cool.

Well, let me ask you.
Do you, uh--

Do you like to bowl?

Oh, my god.
I'm a really good bowler.

Really? Yeah.

I used to be
on a league and stuff.

I would like to see you bowl.

I bet you'd look great bowling.

Maybe we should do that.
Bowling's really--

Excuse me.

Yeah.

Detective Wagner.

Detective Wagner.

Bill?

Yeah. Hold on one--

Just--just one--
Sure.

Yeah, did you see that?

Fuck me running.

I know. Right?

Dude, more than words.

More than words.

I'm--I'm that--

Hold on a second.

I'm sorry, Courtney. I--I, um--

Yeah, yeah.
It's important. Sure.

Listen, why don't
I call you, and...

Okay. We can-- we can do that.

I don't have a pen.
Do you have a--

You know what? I have--

You know what? I have--

I have a card. There you go.

I'm right there on that,

and you call me... Cool.

And we will bowl.

Bowl.

Right. Yeah.

Okay. Cool.

Yeah. All right.

Bye, Chris. Bye.

So, uh, bill--

Yeah.

So those guys
were just freaked out.

Um, so I have this friend.

Yeah?

And, um, her brother--

My friend's brother did, um--

He was really awful to her

he was really awful to her

and cruel

and, like, hit her

and was controlling
and stuff and--

Where is this coming from?

I don't know.

I think stuff about stew
hitting that guy.

I don't--I don't know.

Uh-huh.

Well...

Does she--

I mean your friend.

Does she have a boyfriend

that she'd be more
comfortable talking to?

Well, she always thinks--

Well, she always thinks--

I mean, I think that she--

If he knows that she
has problems,

then he maybe wouldn't
like her anymore.

Well, I mean, I think

that--that her boyfriend
would probably think

that, uh, every good
relationship has problems

and that's just part of it.

That's just what I think.

Will you lie down, please?

I'll let her know what you said.

Mm-hmm.

Well, if she's as
pretty as you are,

would you mind introducing me?

You idiot.

Close your eyes.

Open them.

You're totally into me.

Cool your jets.

I knew it. I could totally tell.

I knew it. I could totally tell.

Look at you talking
like you knew.

It was so obvious.

â™ª Sit tight, firefight â™ª

â™ª Wondering if I should stay â™ª

â™ª Here â™ª

â™ª When you wake up â™ª

â™ª I'll have found
2,124 ways to say â™ª

â™ª I miss you â™ª

â™ª And I care â™ª

â™ª Oh, what'll you say â™ª

â™ª When I get my way? â™ª

â™ª When I get my way? â™ª

â™ª We sit tight, felt fine â™ª

â™ª And grateful â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I really missed you â™ª

â™ª And I should have kissed you â™ª

â™ª Guess I don't have
the courage â™ª

â™ª To wish I had the time â™ª

<i>Oui, mon petite joli Clair.</i>

You know, I got married
in Paris once.

You know, I got married
in Paris once.

In fact, queenie,
I learned to speak

11 languages through the
eye of this camera.

You look so beautiful.

Do you shoot men, too?

Of course,

but exclusively with women.

Eww.

What? Boy-girl shoots
are bestsellers.

Yeah, but that's gross.

What, do you powder their dicks?

No. That's wade's job.
You're late.

Sorry. Right.

You know, I was just
talking about you.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah.

How's the rash?

We're gonna be shooting in here.

All right.

Yeah, this looks good.

You like wine, queenie?

I would love some wine.

Stewie, can I have
these, please?

No, you most certainly may not.

Here. Drink up.

Care for a glass, wade?

Care for a glass, wade?

No, thanks.

I love that.

Bedroom eyes. Bedroom eyes.

That's it.
Come on, give it to me.

Give me a big smile.

Hold that.

Now don't giggle. Don't--
You're doing good.

Turn it to the right.

Turn--there you go.
Now put your head up.

Now look back at me real quick.

All right.

Come on, stop looking at wade.

There you go.

There you go.

Uh, honey,

please stop giggling
like an inbred.

Okay?

Okay?

All right?

All right.

Listen, you want
another shot of Tequila?

I'm sorry you think
I'm such an idiot.

I'm just--I'm not used
to all this attention.

Nonsense. You're not
an idiot at all, okay?

You are gonna be
a worldwide celebrity.

Oh, please.

Nah, this whole thing
is a dance.

It's your personal dance,

your sensual experience.

Ahh. Yeah.

I'm sure you tell that
to all the girls.

Bullshit.

Bullshit.

You're fantastic, all right?

I know greatness when I see it.

What the fuck do you know?

What the fuck do I know?

I'm the world's most-published
erotic photographer.

I think I might know something.

Please. Just relax, baby.

Okay, okay.
You got it, all right?

Come on, get on there.
Get on there,

and do what god
made you to do, baby.

Go on. Go on. Go on your knees.

Give me the Jaguar, mama.

Give me the Jaguar.
Come on, give it to me.

Give it to me. Give it to me.

Come on. Use it. Use it.

You're gonna act like a little
pissed-off pissy ant, then come get it.

You're gonna act like a little
pissed-off pissy ant, then come get it.

Come on. Come, and get you some.

All right? That's it.

Now crawl.

Crawl. Crawl. Crawl!

Crawl. Crawl. Crawl.

All right, let's try it again.

Roll over, please.

Roll over.

Roll over. That's it.

Roll over. That's it.

Now put your butt up there,
just like that.

That's it. Turn your butt
to me a little bit more.

Come on. Just tilt it up.

A little bit more.

Right here. A little more.

I feel like such a whore.

All right, just go
with the feeling, okay?

Just go with the feeling.

And tilt your butt more,
right at me.

Yeah, straight-up
asshole shots, huh?

That's it. More. More.

Is my face even in any of these?

Look, it's what
the magazine wants, okay?

All right, this isn't
for my personal collection.

All right, this isn't
for my personal collection.

Now give me some butt.
There you go.

I just--I don't want to be doing
this shit for no good reason.

I mean, I have a real life.

Look, queenie, okay,

if you would just be
quiet and concentrate,

we'll finish with this.

Is this gonna be a centerfold

or something cool like that?

I don't want to be just--

Look, would you please shut up?

Would it be a cover shot,
at least? Something--

Would you please shut the
fuck up and let me work?

Oh, look, wade, buddy,

you obviously have
some influence over her.

What do you recommend I do?

I don't know.
You want my opinion?

We should just cancel the shoot.

Cancel the shoot?

Oh, that is so fucking typical

of your bullshit generation.

Fuck this!

Now, look, are we
gonna shoot or not?

Hey.

You don't have to do the shoot
if you don't want to, okay?

You're in control
of the situation.

Look, I push you
for your own good.

Look, I push you
for your own good.

Do you want to be a pro or not?

Fine.

Please, just--

All right, get in the position.

Tell me the pose.
We'll finish this.

All right, here--
Here's the pose.

Get on your ass,
and spread your legs. Okay?

Just remember you're in
control of the situation.

What the fuck are you
saying to her, wade?

Huh? What are you, her coach?

What are you, stanislavski?
Get the fuck off my set.

You know what, old man? I've had
enough of your fucking shit.

Ooh, them's fighting
words, ain't they, boy?

Ooh, them's fighting
words, ain't they, boy?

Hey, you know what? Go
fuck yourself, asshole.

Come on. We're going.

Yeah, go fuck yourself, asshole.

W-we're not going anywhere.
We're not done yet.

Oh, we're done, prick.

And give me my fucking money.

Money?

You're not getting
any fucking money.

You were hired to do two sets.

We've barely begun one.
What money?

Who the fuck
do you think you are?

Give her her fucking money.

She needs that money.
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo.

She needs the money, get down there
on the floor and earn it, okay?

Pay the girl, Stewart.

Hey, you, shut up. Powder asses.

Hey, you, shut up. Powder asses.

Come on. Let's go. We're going.

Fuck this has-been.

Oh, well, it's better than being

a never-will-be,
spoiled, dilettante pussy.

Give me my fucking
money, or else.

Or else what?

Or else what?
Or else I call the cops

and tell them you got an
18-year-old drunk, asshole.

All right.

All right.

Let me see if I have
the exact change here.

Yeah. Here's your money.

Hmm?

Pick it up, and get out.

What are you waiting for?

You have another job,
don't you? Get out.

Fine.

Heh heh. You left a few.

Does that make you feel better?

Hi, honey.

You give it to me!

Drinking's not gonna
bring them back.

You give it back to me!

I need it.

That's just it.

There's a whole
goddamn life out there

just waiting for you.

You're the only life I got.

I can't take this anymore.

I can't.

No, don't leave.

Don't leave.

Everybody leaves me.

So fuck it.

So thanks for the ride.

My car is gonna be ready <i>maÃ±ana.</i>

Yeah, you don't
have to thank me.

Fuck. That guy is
a fucking insane bastard.

Yeah. He's an insane douche.

Holy shit. Fucking douche bag.

Fucking douche baggery.

Fucking douche baggery.

I never want to end up
pushing it that hard.

Oh, my god, me neither.
I totally agree.

I just want a little respect
for what I do.

Show up to work,
do the day and that's it.

No, I-I totally know
what you mean.

I mean, I want
to be a real model,

a real actress, you know?

You could do it.

You could do it. You can.

We could do it together.

My prince.

Nice sarcasm.

Sarcasm?

No.

No.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

I know when
something's the matter.

No, you don't know me.

Wow.

You know, you're kind of
full of yourself.

Did anyone ever tell you that?

All right.

I mean, you think
that it's that easy?

That you can just say that you're
gonna do it, and that's it?

I never said that it was easy.
No.

I never said that it was easy.
No.

When did I say that?

I mean, what makes you
so certain?

Nothing.

Right.

Yeah. Whatever.

Okay, don't be mad.

I'm not mad.

You are mad.

You don't even know me.

No, you don't know me.

I don't like being called cocky.

I didn't say that. I'm--

I'm just saying

that it's not that easy.

You can't just say that you're
gonna do it, and that's it. Okay?

You can't just say that you're
gonna do it, and that's it. Okay?

It takes a lot of work,
and you have to go out,

and you have to have
life experiences.

Okay, you know what?

Thanks for the ride.

Yeah, you're welcome. See ya.

If you don't like what you see,

just know it'll only
look worse tomorrow.

Jesus Christ, Stewart.

You scared
the living shit out of me.

That's funny.

I always felt the same
way about you, Donna.

Oh, god.

Don't start with your
fucking bullshit tonight.

You just don't give a shit

about anyone
but yourself, do you?

Who do you give
a shit about, Donna?

Who do you give
a shit about, Donna?

Is that that frigging gun?

Jesus Christ, Stewart.
Stop being an idiot.

Put the gun away, and go to bed.

So who you been blowing
tonight, talented Donna?

Oh, you fucking hypocrite.

Good night.

Was it your drummer friend?

Kiss my ass, Stewart,

you loser.

Well, if I'm a loser,

then what does that make you?

God, I'm so tired of this.

God, I'm so tired of this.

You know what?

If it makes you feel
any better, I, um--

I didn't fuck anybody...

Tonight.

Oh!

And the award for abstinence

in the face of endless
Hollywood cock and pussy

goes to Donna fox.

Good night, asshole.

Stop it.

Get your hands off me.

What's the matter?
All fucked out?

You got no jam left for papa?

You got no jam left for papa?

Oh, stop it!

Get your hands off me.

Oh, yeah?

Ahh!

What are you,

Fuck off.
Just get off me, Stewart.

I'll fucking kill you.

You're gonna kill me?

Yeah, I'll fucking
kill you. I will.

You're gonna kill me?

I'll fucking kill you. Fuck you.

Fuck off!

You live here?
That's so ridiculous.

Yeah. No, no. I just--I own it.

I don't live here.
I just check in and--

Well, who lives here?

Uh...

Is that a person over there?

Oh, it's--
It's all right.

Oh, it's--
It's all right.

It's, uh--
I'll call somebody.

It's all right. It's my aunt.

She just gets a little confused.

Come on, Gloria.

Gloria. Let's go.

Hi, honey.

Come on, sweetie.

She's just a little confused.

Yeah. Do you need--

Do you want help? I don't--

Hey, where are we going?

We're going inside.

I'll see you around.

See you around.

See ya.

Come on.

One step at a time. That's it.

One step at a time. That's it.

I'm fine.

I know. I know.

â™ª Turn the same corner â™ª

â™ª Again and again â™ª

Oh! Who's there?

Look, queenie, I just--

Stewart? Oh, my god.

What are you doing here?

Oh, nothing.

I was just--

Wanted to apologize to you

for being such a bastard to you.

For being such a bastard to you.

And I wanted
to give you your money

that you left.

And also,

I wanted to give you these,

because you deserve them,

and--and I wanted to wish you
all the luck in the world.

Thank you.

That's really sweet.

Are you okay?

Heh heh. I'm all right. Heh.

Heh heh. I'm all right. Heh.

Are you all right?

I want you to know something.

You're an angel.

All right?

Whoa.

Gotta go.

Cool.

Ooh. A-are you--
Are you okay?

Oh, yeah. I'm good.

Okay.

I-I'm sorry.

Aah! Ow!

Look, I'm your neighbor.

I--I live across the street.

Liar.

Did you come to kill me?

No! I would never hurt you.

Look, lady, please,

put the kettle down, all right?

I-I'm sorry
I bothered you, miss.

Gloria.

My name's Gloria.

Nice to meet you, Gloria.

Oh! Sweet Jesus.

Oh! Sweet Jesus.

What?

Could I, uh,

offer you a cup
of nice, hot tea, mister?

Fox.

My name's Stewart fox.

And if you promise
not to scald me again,

I would love a cup of tea.

Come in.

We were sisters together.

Really? Your sister?

We were immaculate sisters.

We took our vows
at the same time.

We took our vows
at the same time.

You were a sister... Hmm.

In an order?

Wow.

A nun.

I want you to know
I went to catholic school,

so I know what you ladies
are capable of.

Don't you forget it, mister.

I'm impressed.

I can't believe a nun,

and all this time,
you've been living

right across the street from me.

Across the street?

Yeah. I mean,
it's kind of catty-corner.

The house with the fountain.

The house with the fountain.

You've got an awful lot

of pretty girlfriends
living there.

Well, they're not
exactly girlfriends.

I mean, they're models, mostly.

I take their pictures.
I'm a photographer.

Oh.

My nephew's always watching.

I think that's the only
reason he drops by.

Oh, you must mean the cop.

Yeah, he's had me
in a panic a few times.

Yeah, he's had me
in a panic a few times.

He drives
an unmarked car now, right?

You want a topper?

Um...

No, thank you, ma'am.

He's a good boy, though.

He's always bringing
groceries to his old,

he's always bringing
groceries to his old,

Awkward aunt.

Oh, come on.

You're neither old nor awkward.

Please allow me.

All right.

Thank you.

Oh, you're welcome.

So a photographer living
across the street.

That's a creative profession.

That's a creative profession.

Mm, it can be,

when they let me.

It's a gift from god,
don't you think?

Absolutely.

I don't know
as if I ever had a gift.

I thought I did once.

Well, I'm sure you still do.

I just got up one
morning, and it was gone.

Well, I know what you mean.

You know, back in the
seventies and eighties,

I was pretty famous.

Not so much anymore.

You know, I feel like--

Sometimes I think the whole
world caught up to me

and just passed me by, you know?

I don't know where it went,

but I never got it back again.

But I never got it back again.

Well, I suppose that

we have to love and take
care of our gifts, Gloria,

or they leave us.

Goodness.

Goodness me, Stewart.

Yes, ma'am?

A friend.

A friend.

I am so grateful
you came to see me.

Here's looking at you, sister.

Here's looking at you, sister.

Bye.

Hey. Do you mind if I crash?

Uh, yeah.

Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

Oh, wait. There's one more.
Hang on.

Oh, wait. There's one more.
Hang on.

Hey, wait. Wait.
Where you going?

Ow. Ow!

Help, help, help, help, help.

Ow.

Hey, my jacket.

Oh, there's some rum in there.

You want a shot?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Thank you.

Mm.

Mm.

It's warm.

Yeah.

Ah. Strong.

Hi.

Hi.

Now crawl. Crawl. Crawl.

Crawl! Crawl! Crawl!

Why are you doing this?

You are acting like a crazy man.

I'm out of here!

Stew.

I love you, Donna.

I love you very much.

Oh.

You wear it...

Like this,

pointing to your heart

pointing to your heart

so that the one that you love
is always with you.

I'll always be with you.

Heh.

â™ª "Don't go easy on me now,"
she said â™ª

â™ª "Just think it over instead" â™ª

â™ª Our time's now
and now and now â™ª

â™ª Our time's now
and now and now â™ª

â™ª "So go crazy on me now,"
she said â™ª

â™ª "Just think it over instead" â™ª

â™ª That's all she said â™ª

â™ª "Don't go easy on me now,"
she said â™ª

â™ª "Just think it over instead" â™ª

â™ª Our time's now
and now and now â™ª

â™ª "So go crazy on me now,"
she said â™ª

â™ª "On this new feeling" â™ª

â™ª "On this new feeling" â™ª

â™ª That's all she said â™ª

Stew.

Hey, forget about stew,
okay, all his bullshit.

You two love each other
in your own way.

But you do.

You love each other.

Oh, and speak of the devil.

Wow. That's just how I got it.

Wow. That's just how I got it.

Uh, okay.

"In waves," did you love it?

You don't have to apologize.

I'm just glad you're back.

Oh, I'm back...

For good.

Would Mrs. fox like to make love

to her husband tonight?

Oh, Mr. fox.

You look absolutely beautiful.

You do, Courtney. Look.

I do, huh?

Yeah, and where'd you get
that twinkle in your eye,

yeah, and where'd you get
that twinkle in your eye,

you little slut? Shut up.

Ah, good morning, ladies.

Everybody, folks,
gather round, please.

All right, people,

gather round, please.

Here we go, everybody.

All right,
today is the beginning

of a new and exciting adventure,

an adventure into our special
world of Eros and fantasy.

Now I do realize, in the past,

I've been curt and
slightly overbearing.

Just slightly. Yeah.

Well, perhaps that is an
understatement, Courtney.

TouchÃ©, darling.

TouchÃ©, darling.

Love and kisses.

All I'm trying to say
is, from now on,

there'll be no more
screaming, temper tantrums,

the use of derogatory
language and slurs.

Okay.

Let's have ourselves
a wonderful shoot today

and every day to follow.

Oh! Places!

Maybe I can stay for, um...

Just a few more days?

Oh, my god.

Wade!

Oh, my god!

Look at them!

It's amazing.

Do you like 'em?

They're incredible.

There's, like, 200 of 'em.

One for you. One for me.

I'm gonna put this
in the bathroom.

Eww. Gross.

Hello!

Oh, hello, Stewart. Oh, my god.

How are you? Hi.

I made you some crispy treats.

Ah, you're such a dear.

Everybody, this is Gloria,

the very inspiration
of our shoot today.

Oh, Stewart.

And, Gloria,
this is my wife Donna,

the love of my life. Hi.

Oh. Hi.

So sweet of you.

Oh, my.

It's great, huh?

Oh. I used to look like that.

Yeah?

Yeah?

I mean, not like--

Stewart, I should be going.

I don't want to be in the way.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Today you sit upon the
throne of honor, my dear.

And that one?

Mm-hmm.

Oh, that's great.

Now this one.

Oh, that is good.

That's so me.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Ooh. A comedy
about rock 'n' roll.

That's so perfect.

Why?

I think it's gonna be good.

You're no rock 'n' roller.

I'm a total rock 'n' roller.

Don't tell me I'm
not a rock 'n' roller.

Remember you're
amongst friends, dear.

All right, everybody, places!

Hi, baby.

Oh?

Off you go. Go.

Go.

Go.

All right, Courtney, baby.

Shower me with Grace, honey.

That's it. That's it. That's it.

That's it. Feel the love, honey.
Feel the love.

Spread 'em. Wider.

Wider.

Oh!

Hi.

Hi.

Yeah?

Why not? Right on.

You big, dirty cop.

â™ª You have been all your life â™ª

â™ª Wishing well for everyone â™ª

â™ª Don't look back, step aside â™ª

â™ª You deserve a second chance â™ª

â™ª Time is right â™ª

â™ª Time is right â™ª

â™ª Fix your hair â™ª

â™ª Change your face â™ª

â™ª Prepare for torture â™ª
â™ª in your mind â™ª

So?

So?

So...

Do you want me to move out?

I'll--I'll go, but I--

Shh. If you want, you know...

Shh.

Shh.

I can hear your heart.

I want you to stay.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

Yeah? Mm-hmm.

I love you.

I love you, too.

â™ª Prepare for torture â™ª

â™ª Prepare for torture â™ª

â™ª Prepare for torture â™ª

â™ª All those senses natural â™ª

â™ª So robotic, but alive â™ª

â™ª You've done well
while you're young â™ª

â™ª You'll do better every time â™ª

â™ª Time is right â™ª

â™ª Little girl â™ª

â™ª So far out â™ª

â™ª So far out â™ª

â™ª Golden calf â™ª

â™ª Now we take, it's gonna
leave you fast â™ª

â™ª And growing like a pearl â™ª

â™ª Sits there between â™ª

â™ª Stop the car,
but leave it running â™ª

â™ª Bad mistakes are waiting
in the trunk â™ª

â™ª Bad mistakes are waiting
in the trunk â™ª

â™ª And I'm sure that I â™ª

â™ª Could take the money and run â™ª

â™ª And leave you like
you left me all along â™ª

â™ª But it's not my style â™ª

â™ª I, I, I, I â™ª

â™ª I could be â™ª

â™ª Ri-I-I-ight â™ª

to feel this way â™ª

â™ª God, it's so sweet of you â™ª

â™ª God, it's so sweet of you â™ª

â™ª Stop the car
and wait a minute â™ª

â™ª Till the police
stop chasing us around â™ª

â™ª I'm so tired now â™ª

â™ª And you're tied
in the back seat â™ª

â™ª But I'm sure we will
get out of this somehow â™ª

â™ª So let's split this town â™ª

â™ª I, I, I, I â™ª

â™ª Just take the money, and run â™ª
