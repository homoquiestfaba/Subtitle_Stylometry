{\an8}Welcome, my young entrepreneurs.

They say there are no shortcuts in life.

They say nothing is free.

But I'm telling you right now,
the deal I'm going to give you

is the closest thing to free
you'll ever get.

You all heard the rumors.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

Now's your chance to see it up close.

I give you the product for free.

You sell it.

Sounds too good to be true.

That's because it is.

We'll only be in New Orleans
for a little while,

so get out there and sell.

What's it called?

You ask a lot of questions.

Yeah, I'm Newt.

Newt.

This...

is Power.

<i>Orleans Parish, 9-1-1.</i>

<i>My friend is having some</i>
<i>strange reaction right now.</i>

<i>She just took a pill.</i>

<i>This is what I'm telling you, man,</i>
<i>he lifted the freaking car over his head.</i>

<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

<i>I don't know how to describe this,</i>
<i>but I just seen some weird shit.</i>

<i>Look, I don't see no blood at all.</i>
<i>No blood.</i>

<i>9-1-1, where is your emergency?</i>

<i>Nine-one-one.</i>

Bird!

Come on, man. There's no bird.

We shouldn't even be here right now.

Bird!

Come on, bird!
You're not even listening.

All right, all right.

Say, bro, let me see your hands.

Hands, now!

You don't got no gun.

You wanna find out?

Whoa. How much?

Five hundred.
Five hundred?

Are you serious?

Supply and demand. You want it or not?

I wanna climb the walls.

That's not how it works.

You take it,
for five minutes, you get what you get.

Instead of selling it to us,
why don't you just give it to us?

Don't touch me! Get off!
Take that stupid mask off!

No!

Leave me alone! Get off!

Get off me! Give me my bag!

Give me my bag!

Stop! How many has she got?
Just three.

But I bet this chick has more.

Gentlemen, on your knees,
hands behind your head.

NOPD.

I see we have a lady here, as well.
You too, ma'am.

Hands, very good. Thank you.

Now, how's everybody doing tonight?

You sure you want to do that, young man?

You ever taken one of those before?

You haven't, have you? I can tell.

Now, I bet you've heard
it can make you fast, make you strong.

Make this a fair fight, even though
I got a gun pointed at your face.

Just twist it, Tommy.

But that's only
if you happen to have a good Power.

Not everybody does.

Some people take it and just blow up.

I don't wanna do this anymore, man.
Shut up.

So the question is, what's your power?

Might be good, might be bad, nobody knows.

Take the pill, Tommy.

Take it.

Go ahead.

I wanna see what happens.

You boys are lucky
I only have one pair of cuffs.

I'd bring you all in.

You can go now.

Go!

Man, you crazy.

You okay?

I had it.

That is not what I saw.

So what, you practice that in the mirror?

Yeah, you did.

I bet you had your gun out too.

Pointed at yourself, talking all hard
like you Clint Eastwood.

You don't know me.

Yeah, I do.

What do you know about Clint Eastwood?

I know enough.

What you seen him in?

<i>The Bridges of Madison County.</i>
That's actually a pretty good one.

By the way,
it's 500 for that pill in your pocket.

The same stuff as last time?

Yeah, what else it gonna be?
I don't know.

Did you get it from the same guy
as last time?

Come on, you either gonna be a cop
or a customer.

It's not that simple.

Bad guys using this stuff

to take out whole precincts of cops
single-handed.

I'm just trying
to level the playing field.

Be careful with that.

Yeah, thanks.

What do you think of the bike?
It's an all right bike.

Well, you want it or not?

I mean, I brought it here for you.
You lying.

No, you said it was your birthday
the other day, right?

That was a month ago.
Okay then, you know what? Never mind.

No, I mean, I want the bike.
Yeah, you sure?

Yeah.

Why the seat made out of duct tape?
It was nicest one at the impound lot.

It's mine?
Get on!

Damn!

<i>Good morning, New Orleans!</i>

<i>I have a caller on the line.
Tell me exactly what you saw.</i>

<i>Man, I saw a kid running</i>
<i>down Poydras last night,</i>

<i>35 miles per hour.</i>

<i>Did you have a speed gun</i>
<i>on this guy?</i>

<i>Man, if the speed limit is 25,</i>
<i>he passed it down cold.</i>

<i>I'm telling you, he was on something.</i>

<i>Bruh, it sounds like</i>
<i>you might have been on something.</i>

<i>Wayne, you can make fun all you want,</i>

<i>but I'm telling you, something going on.</i>

<i>There's videos. I saw one the other day,</i>

<i>a kid jumped straight off the roof
of the casino and just walked away.</i>

<i>Maybe there's a little conspiracy going...</i>

Who is it?

Looking for Newt.

I ain't ask who you're looking for,
I said, "Who is it?"

I understand that, sir.
I'm a friend of Simon's.

I'm from Tampa.

He sent me here to talk to you.
Maybe you wanna do some business.

Come where I can see you.

Merry Christmas.

You alone?

Aren't we all?

Let me see your hands.

I got a box in my hands.

You wanna see my hands,
or put the box down?

What you want?
Yeah...

No.
Which one? Box down, hands up?

Put the box down and get your hands up.

Okay, I'm with you. Box down.
Yeah, just...

Now, slow, real slow now.

Yeah, slow, everything's slow.

If you want, you can call Simon.
He'll verify who I am.

Tell him that the Major's here to see you.

The Major.

Say, bruh.

I'ma go make that call.
You stay right there.

I wouldn't do that.

Newt.

I don't wanna hurt you.

I don't wanna hurt nobody.

Just need some information, that's all.

Tell me where you're getting this stuff,
and I'll get out of here.

You don't wanna talk?

All you gotta do
is tell me who your supplier is.

So what you think about that, Newt, huh?
We got a deal?

Once I get that information,

you can slither back to whatever hole
that you came out of, understand?

Listen to my voice.

Am I lying?

What? I know you not...

Get the hell out of my kitchen!

Oh, Lord!

Newt, you gonna get somebody
killed in here!

Where you getting this shit from?
Who's making it? Tell me the source!

I ain't telling you shit!

Tell me right now! Who's the supplier?

Give me one name!

You gonna tell me!

Tell me who it is!

Okay. Big Man.

His name's Biggie.
Speak up, son!

That's all I know, man!

Where's he at?
I...

Huh? Where's Biggie?

How many did you take?

No! Daddy! Daddy!

Hey, mister.

Is he dead?

He's alive, man.

Robin.

Are you up?

Robin.
Yeah.

You late.

I'm up.

Mmhmm.

Ma, you okay?

Yeah, baby. Be right out.

I'll make you some soup.

Man, we all out.

Just get to school.

I'ma go pick some up later.

And your prescription too.

<i>The initial investigation
is indicating a home meth lab,</i>

<i>but we're gonna wait
until we see the full report</i>

<i>- before we make an assessment.</i>
Yeah.

<i>It was deemed unsafe years ago.</i>

Isn't that where Newt hangs out?

Uh, I'm not sure, could be.

Text your cousin for me, baby.

That's a pretty big fire.

I'm sure he's fine, Ma.

Mmm.

On a scale of one to ten,
how bad is it today?

Seven, seven and a half.

I'm sorry, Ma.
Mm-hmm.

You gotta go.

Well, I'll come through

with your prescription
and your soup tonight.

My hero.

Want some company?

All right, then.

Hmm.

This is a major problem during pregnancy

known as FAS.

Birth defects caused by drinking alcohol
and using drugs while pregnant.

How do we prevent these birth defects?

Put that up.
Ladies.

I'm guessing that you're discussing
what the condition is called

when a child is exposed to alcohol
in the womb, right?

F... feeble alcohol syndrome.

Fetal.

But yes, correct.

Now, let's talk about prevention.

How do we prevent these birth defects?

No drugs, no alcohol.

Simple.
It is the only form known as FAS...

I know that you don't think
this stuff is serious,

you don't think it's important, but it is.

Right now,
you're getting a D in this class, Robin.

It's an easy class.

Quiet.

So since you don't seem to be worried
about your grades or graduating...

you must have a plan, right?

So what is that plan, Miss Reilly?

Rap.

She'll rap.

I see.

Well, then,
why don't you get up and rap for us?

Make me believe that you've got a shot,

and I'll give you a C for the year.

Oh!

<i>Yeah! That's my girl.</i>

Sit down! Stop!

Robin!
Sit down.

Robin!
Sit down!

Put her down!
Robin!

Well, then.

You can give me that phone

or you can go to the office.

Let's get back to prevention, please.

There is no magic pill to fix it.

<i>Reports of armed robbery</i>
<i>downtown near the Savings bank.</i>

<i>All available officers please respond.</i>

Sir, what'd you see in there?

I don't know, I didn't see him.

He came out of nowhere.

It's like I was hit by a ghost.

By a ghost?

This is not right, man, you gotta...

Yo, captain!

You can't just get...
Not now, Landry. Not now.

You can't just come and take my shit over.

What's going on?

Armed robber, multiple hostages,
the negotiator can't make contact.

Why aren't we going in?

Pretty sure our scene just became theirs.

You weren't down here ten minutes ago.
What is this? What do we do?

This is wrong. I'm gonna remember that.
I'm gonna remember that.

What's all that?

We've been asked to stand down.

We're here in support now only.

Frank, this is some bullshit, man.

Like, if it was up to me...

Hey, buddy.

Take a break.

Where are they?

Behind you!

The bags! The bags! Follow the bags!

Get those bags!

Bank units go.

<i>All units set up a perimeter.</i>

<i>Subject is male, possibly Caucasian.</i>

<i>Shit, I can't tell.</i>

Watch out!

You all right?

Hey! Hey! Out of the way! Out of the way!

Get out of the way! Go! Go!

Are you okay?
Yeah.

Hey! NOPD! You hear me?

Stop the car!

Hey! Stop the streetcar!

Has anybody seen an invis...

Stop the streetcar!

You're under arrest!

Stop!

Freeze! I can see you!

NOPD, you're under arrest!

I said freeze!

Freeze! Don't move.

Frank! Watch out!

Frank, stop! Stop!

And a small fries.

Scale of one to ten,
ten being the worst,

what's your pain right now?

It doesn't hurt.
Any soreness in here?

No, ma'am.
Lose consciousness?

For a second, I did there.

Look at my finger. Follow it.

Can you excuse us for a minute?

Sure.

Did you take a pill today?

Yes.

Put your gun and the badge on the table.

Captain.

Gun and badge on the table, now.

If I hadn't taken that,Â I'd be dead.

That what you want?
I want my police force to obey the law!

There are no laws on this drug!

They don't exist officially,
'cause every time we try to deal with it,

some guys in suits show up
and tell us to stop.

Look, I don't know who those two were
that came in today

and cut you off at the knees.

I don't know
if they're feds or military or what,

but clearly,
they have you under their thumb.

And I don't think you like it.

'Cause they don't care
about the people of this city.

Not like you do, not like I do,

and we know what happenedÂ last time
we were counting on guys in suits

to look out for New Orleans.

Now, you need to make me the bad guy,
that's fine.

But I'd be willing to bet
you know more than you're allowed to say.

Maybe we can work together on this,
unofficially.

And maybe we can do some good.

And isn't that our job?

<i>Captain, suspect is</i>
<i>currently being removed from the premises.</i>

Anybody finds you with that,
you didn't get it from me.

I'm told he's the source of Power.

We shut him down, we get our city back.

Who is he?

He's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

You okay, honey?

You need anything else?
No, I'm fine.

Hmm. Yes, you are.

So, can I get you anything?

You got any hot water?

I'll take some of that.
Yeah. Okay, I'll get that for you.

Jessica!

Can I get some hot water?

Newt, you in there?

Newt.

Seriously?

Say, you saw who did this?

No, I just came out the door.

Please! Please! Wait! Get off me!

Help me!

<i>It's Robin. You know what to do.</i>

Hey, it's me.

I need to re-up,
so meet me in the usual spot.

Let me out! Please, let me out!

You keep kicking around in there.

This how we gonna do this.

All that kicking ain't making no sense.

Somebody help!

You in a strange man's car
in an even stranger place.

Help!

Help, please!

But I need to have a conversation
with you.

I need to be able to look...

I need to be able to look you in your eye.

You don't wanna calm down,

maybe I need to make a trip over
to 32 Park, right?

You know where 32 Park is?

Well, if I let you out
and you start crying,

I'ma pay a little visit to Irene.

Make sure she all right, huh?

I take it you love Irene
'cause you ain't knocking no more.

So when I open this up,

I want my conversation.

Why don't we start
from the beginning, make it simple?

What's your name?

Huh?
I'm Robin!

Oh, I can't hear you.

What is it?
Robin.

Robin.

You push that Power, don't you?

I don't know nothing about that...

You don't know?
No! I don't!

Maybe you'll figure it out, huh?
You stay in there until you figure it out.

I don't know!

What's the source?

I don't know.
You don't know?

Maybe you know something about Newt.
I don't... I don't know...

Oh, you don't know who Newt is?
No.

That's funny
because Newt be all in your phone.

I get weird texts from people all the time
because that's what the job is.

Well, let me tell you
what's even more weird.

Newt ain't here no more.
What?

So since Newt ain't here,
that leads us to... where to, huh?

Where to, Robin?
I need to know where the source is.

I don't... Believe me!

I said get out!

Why?

So you can advance your position in life.

Who is that?

Hmm? Look closer, is that Biggie?
I don't know.

You don't know?
No, I don't know.

Oh, you on these streets,
you don't know shit.

I know you're scared.

I know you're feeling
like fight or flight,

but I'ma tell you right now,
you just breathe and get through it

because listen, you don't know who I am
and what I'm about,

but I got to find that source.

I need to get
to the top of the food chain.

But you keep messing around withÂ me
and acting like you don't know shit,

I'm gonna knock your ass out,
and then I'm gonna go kill your mother.

I'ma kill Irene.

Look me in my eyes.

Am I lying?

So tell me your decision.

There's our buyer.

You trust her?

She's connected to every cartel
in South America.

She's the real deal.

And the money?

You'll get it.

Then our backers will see
what the rest of us have already seen.

What's that?

That we're working for the woman
who's gonna change the world.

Ready to go.

<i>Bienvenidos.</i>

Welcome. I see you packed light.

I was expecting...

duffel bags.

The money is here...

if the product lives up to its reputation.

Product?

It is not just a product.

These pills will topple governments.

You're about to become
the most powerful woman in South America.

In that case,
I look forward to your demonstration.

Hey, I see what you doin'.

Give me this.

You do what I told you.

No messing around.

<i>Operator.</i>

Hi.

I was told to call this number
if I ever had a problem.

<i>Go to Hong Kong Market off of Patterson.</i>

<i>Go to the back and ask for alligator wine.</i>

<i>Come alone.</i>

Okay.

You're gonna go meet whoever's in there,

you're gonna tell them
what we talked about.

You're gonna tell them that you saw me
and that I left.

No...
And if they ask...

No, you said point you in a direction,
that's a direction.

You ever hear of a mine rat?

It sound like a rat that get blown up.
Well, that's what you are.

You're my mine rat.

Look, I was just trying to make ends meet.
I'm just a kid, I'm...

I know what you trying to do!

You out here in these streets dealing,
you ain't no damn kid.

You gave that up.

You can't keep playing
that whole "I'm just a child" card, okay?

Let's make it happen.

Yes, sir.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Alligator wine?

That's not a thing.

Can you just ask somebody?

He said wait here.

Excuse me,
could you help me out with this?

What?

Is it spicy, is it mild?
I don't know what the fuck it is.

I don't work here.

Watch your step.

Okay, why don't you have a seat?

How'd you get the number?

Newt gave it to me.

You're a dealer.

Yeah, he gave it to me
in case something went wrong.

Newt's dead.

I know.

How'd that happen?

There's this guy.

He calls himself "The Major."

He killed him.

Then he threw me in his trunk.

He's right outside.

Can I go?

You should stay right here.

This is the safest place for you
right now.

You Biggie?

I'm not Biggie.

Biggie works in sales.
This is distribution.

Talk to me.
Listen, I can...

I don't want to talk to any middle men.
Already did that.

You don't tell me where Biggie is,
I'll cut your fucking head off.

Start the truck!

Let me out!

Hey!

Hey, Robin!

You still in there?

You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.

Don't worry, okay? I'm gonna come...

Everything's okay.

Tracy.

Baby.

It's so good to see you.

What? What?

Cover your ears.

What's that?

They're logging Powers.
There's chips in every capsule.

The government won't let them test it,
so they test it on us.

The people that you're selling to,

they're the lab rats.

What's all that?

It's a demonstration for potential buyers.

It means they're done with New Orleans.
It means I'm running out of time.

I gotta go there.

You gotta take me there.

Tracy, take...

Help!

Help!

Help!

Robin, I need...

Please.

You killed my cousin.

He ODed. I didn't kill him.

I got money.

Please.

I'm just trying...
I'm just trying to find my daughter.

Yo, chill.

Yo, you need to calm down.

You fell out, I brought you to the vet.
My mom work here.

You did this?

Yeah.

But now I need to finish the exit wound.

You gonna let me do it or not?

I guess that's a yes.

Wait, wait, wait.

What?

Y'all work on humans?

Nope.

Ah.

I didn't even do nothing yet.

There a lot of girls
that look just like her!

Mrs. Reilly, do you want
your daughter to end up dead?

I already told you,
I don't know where she is.

She was supposed to be home hours ago.
What...

With all due respect, officer,
there's a lot of girls...

This could get very ugly
for your daughter

and for you.
Are you sure it was her?

Are you sure you're not mistaken?

Are you sure
you haven't seen this man before?

No, I told you I don't know
what you talking about.

That's funny.

We have surveillance footage
of your daughter with this man tonight

committing crimes
about five miles from here.

Are you sure?

This could get a whole lot uglier for you.

Honey, bear. Are we all out
of that one hippie shampoo that...

Whoa! What the shit's going on here?
Who the hell are you guys?

What you doing in my bathroom?

We're the police. Who are you?
Man, I live here.

Babe, I'm sorry I was in your shower.
The pressure's so much better in yours.

Can you come over here?

I'm really sorry
it had to happen that way.

Robin sent me.

Let me just handle these guys, okay?

Officers.

What precinct
did you guys say you're from?

They didn't say.

Sir, Mrs. Reilly and her daughter

seem to be the only residents
registered to this address.

I see.

So now because I'm not
in your little database, I can't...

Bless you.

Is there a cat in here?

I thought you said you lived here.

Yes, I do, sir.

Is that so hard to believe? Why?

Is it because I'm white?

Are you assuming
that me and this beautiful Black woman

wouldn't be able to share a happy home?

You wanna say that on camera?

Babe, where's your phone?
Got it.

All right.
Well, let's just see about this.

And we are live streaming.

Now, let's just get this on record.

Honey, did either of these men
show you a warrant

when they came into our house?

No, they did not.

Uh-huh. And did either of them
show you a badge?

No! Can I see your badges?

Gentlemen.

Thank you for your time, Mrs. Reilly.

I'm sorry, do I know you?

You got any duct tape?

Duct tape? What?

Stop! Who are you?

My name is Detective Frank Shaver, NOPD.

Can I see your badge?

Well, I don't have it on me.

Where do you have it?

Mrs. Reilly, your daughter and I
have had a professional friendship

for a little over half a year now.

She's a very smart
and good-hearted young person,

but she is mixed up in some things
she shouldn't be,

and I am trying to help her.

Thank you. I'm gonna need this too.

Where's yours?

So what's your power?

I don't even know.

Come on. You ain't tried it?

Honestly...

I saw a girl OD.

You know, on the streets,

they're talking about
how it'll give you superpowers,

but not about
how one hit could kill you.

Yeah.

Well, if you're so spooked,

why you still in the game?

What happened to getting good grades
and staying in school?

Yo, I wish I could get good grades.

Go to school, get to college,
get some fancy-ass job.

But I need money now.

Everybody need money now.

Well, my mother has diabetes now.

And we don't got no health insurance.

And she needs surgery, the expensive kind,
so what else am I supposed to do?

Oh, that's easy.

What?
Go to the Army.

What, it don't trip you up killing fools?
Yeah, it tripped me up.

But that was my skill set.

And what did the system do?
It took advantage of me.

But I know now I got to work the system
harder than it's working me.

That's what you gotta do.

You're young, you're Black,
you're a woman.

The system is designed
to swallow you whole.

You gotta find out what you do
better than anybody else and rock that.

So what you gonna do? Hmm?

How you gonna leave your mark?

I rap.

Oh.

I'm sorry.
Well, what's your rap name then, huh?

What you gonna be, the next Cardi B?

Huh? Cardi C?

Well, go ahead and spit then.

You say you rap, let me hear one line.

Huh? You can't spit one line?

I don't like doing it in front of people.

How you gonna to be a rapper
if you got stage fright?

You know what I think? Most time,
people don't wanna do something

is 'cause they're probably just wack
at it.

If you wack, just say you wack.

Fine, give me a word.

Give you a word? What you talking about?

I'm gonna go off the top, give me a word.

Oh, you that good, huh?

Feline.

Feline.

Give me another word.

Seismograph.

Antibiotic.

Antibiotic.

Ooh...

You smoked that.

All right.

You're good, damn good.

That's your power.

You take that, you leverage that,

you use your power
to take the system down.

All right.

And what's this?

You gotta take four of them.

This says for dogs.

Yeah, well, you a big dog.

Well, where you going now?

Remember that guy in the picture?
Yeah.

Gotta find him.

He took something from me.
I gotta get it back.

Something or someone?

We ain't done here.
Give me...

Listen, don't press your luck.

I could navigate for you. You're going
to where the dots on the screen is.

I can take you there.

For ten grand.

Why the hell would I pay you $10,000
for anything?

Medical expenses,
keeping your ass alive, kidnapping fee.

Give me those keys.

I'd say I done you a lot of solids here.

All right.

Two.
Five.

So, this is your daughter, Tracy.

Yeah.

She look like you.

And you think that guy with the beard
took her?

You ever hear of Teleios?

No.

What's that?

Defense contractor.

They were the ones who cracked the codes
back in the day.

Grabbed a bunch of Rangers,

put 'em all in the room,
filled them up with radiation.

Messed with their genes.

Tried to turn us into superheroes.

Why'd they wanna make superheroes?

They didn't. Not really.

'Cause in the real world,
the power goes to where it always goes,

to the people that already have it.

Okay. So, what's your power?

I know you took it.

I tried it once.

Damn near killed me, hurt a lot of people.

So I said
I'm not trying that shit no more.

A few years later, Tracy came along.

I knew she was different though.

When she was young,
she never got sick or anything like that.

As she got older, she got stronger.

She exhibited symptoms of...

powers.

But she never had to take a pill.

Fetal alcohol syndrome.

If you got, like, beaucoup shit
in your system,

maybe it got passed down to her.

Oh, okay.
Yeah, you hood, but you smart, huh?

Anyway, when Teleios caught wind of Tracy,

they wanted to experiment on her
like they did on me.

And that's when we just took off.

I'm sorry.

Are you okay?

Put your seat belt on.

I got my seat belt on.
No, you don't. Put your seat belt on!

Somebody's following us.

Nobody's following us.
Hold on.

Keep your head down.
Okay, okay, okay!

This voice,
do what I tell you to do, okay?

Daddy, watch out!

Daddy!

Trace! No!

Tracy!

Daddy!

Daddy! Daddy!

Tracy!

Hey!

Art?

You okay?

I mean, this is the spot.

It's the spot.

So, there's that guy.

What's the plan now?

Babe, come on.

I'm coming.
Come on, come on.

You know what? Sometimes,
the plan just walk right up on you.

Know what I'm saying?
That's what I'm trying...

Hey, man, I'm sorry,
you got a light on you, man?

Watch it.
No, be nice.

You gonna act like that, huh?

Your girl got you feeling good?
She look good, man.

Kidnapping fee.

So what you see?

I see some fancy clothes.

Stuck-up guy.

Stuck-up guy with a gun.
With a gun.

Man, they definitely
ain't gonna cash no checks, you heard?

No, not at all.

All right, that's all I need.

Yo, yo.

What?
What you doing?

I thought we was like Batman and Robin.

We ain't Batman and Robin,
that's a movie, this is real life.

Man, I got your blood on me.

We doing this.
Listen.

You just hang here
and wait till I get back, all right?

Thanks.

Hey.

Man, glad to be in here.

I'm on the list.

Oh, man! What's up, man?
Can I help you?

Nico!

Man, look.
It's me. Ain't you Nico?

I ain't no Nico, this a private party.

No. You got the wrong spot, man.

No, I know I got the right spot.

You're not on this list, man.
It's a private party. You got to roll out.

Yeah, that's my name right there.

Welcome to Project Power.

Over the last months,
we've been going from city to city

in a kind of a...
let's call them clinical trials.

Our footprint is small,

and we move on quickly
to avoid unwanted oversight.

Our goal is simple.

The next evolution of the human species.

That's where you come in.

<i>With your financing, Teleios could become
the most powerful company in the world.</i>

What's in it for you?

It's in the headline.

Power.

Power to level the playing field.

Or, if you like, destroy it entirely.

Power to create chaos.

Power to renegotiate your reality.

One day, you won't even need a pill.

Pretty words.

Be more specific.

Sure. Let me tell you
about my friend the little lizard.

A healer who can stitch himself up
and even regrow what he lost.

Hands, feet, eyes,
unfathomably complex structures.

The octopus camouflages herself
against the sea floor.

The wolverine frog breaks its own bones
to use as weapons.

They see in the dark,
they dislocate their bones.

They turn water into plasma.

They punch, they strangle,
they thermoregulate.

Evolution has given animals
countless abilities we can only dream of.

So much power, <i>por favor.</i>

All the genetic potential
hidden in our DNA

just waiting to be released.

With your investment,

one day, a pill that lasts forever.

Stop wishing.

Start doing.

Find your power.

Yes, well...

Results may vary.

But as we work to a compound
that we fully control,

we have the tank.

Hey, Frank.

What you doing here?

Looking for you. Your mom is worried sick.

Is she okay?
Yes, she's okay.

Where's he?

I don't know.

Listen, don't bullshit me right now.

I'm not.
Are you protecting him?

No.
Why are you protecting...

This is a bad guy.

Why is he a bad guy?
Because he's done some bad things?

What about you? You do bad things too!

That is almost a good point,
but the bad things that I have done...

He's just looking for his daughter.

Everything he's doing,
he's doing it for her.

That sound like a bad guy to you?
That's what he told you?

That's what I know.

Look, I'm sorry that you miss your dad,

but he's telling you a story...
Don't do me like that...

He's not here looking for his daughter.
He's setting up shop.

You think he's the source of Power?
Yes!

Well, he's not. He's trying to stop it.

Uh-huh. Okay. If that's true,
and by the way, I don't think it is,

but if it is,
then he should be helping me.

If it's not true, then he's lying to you
and he's dangerous

and I need to bring him in. Either way,
you should tell me where he is.

Ladies, gentlemen,
the moment you've traveled so far to see.

What's gonna happen to me?
Don't worry.

This tank is completely safe.

They have one at the CIA.

Twist to activate.

Yes.

How exciting, my friends.

You're about to witness a very rare power.

Thermoregulation.

This one can get a bit intense.

Let me talk to you a sec.

Let's make sure she stays comfortable.

VoilÃ .

Are you new?

No, I've been here...

There's people on this list
I don't think should be here.

Like who?

<i>- Â¿QuÃ© te parece?</i>
Hmm.

<i>EspectÃ¡culo.</i>

Yeah.

Just like <i>Frozen.</i>

<i>Esto es nada. Hay mucho mÃ¡s.</i>

<i>Mucho mÃ¡s.</i>

She's having a great time.

Dirty martini.

You're him.
This is what's gonna happen.

You're gonna take two steps to the left.
Look at me.

You're gonna walk out of that elevator,
I'ma be right behind you.

Please. I'm about to sell 100,000 pills.

Let me finish this sale.
No, we ain't got time for that.

Shit.

Get down!
Don't come closer.

Just do what he says.

Tell him put it down. Talk to him.

Just do what he says.

Put your guns down.

You don't,
I'll make a mess of him right now.

You can have him.
We're just gonna take the pills.

Fine, take the pills.
We can work it out.

Hey! Put the case down now!

Don't! Don't come any closer.

Nobody wants to die.

Put your guns down.

Let's talk.

All right?

Let's talk.

Yeah. That's good.

No!

Oh!

Get me out! Get me out! Get me out!

Get me out!

Get me out of here!

Help me! Please!

Where is she? Where's my daughter?

Now let's talk.
Yes.

Whatever you want. Pills, money, anything.

I don't want no frickin' pills.

Who is this, and where do I find them?

I don't know.
You don't know?

Just... please, no need for this...
Huh? No?

I bet you know now, huh?

Genesis. Genesis.

What the hell is Genesis?

The whole operation's
on a boat called the Genesis.

Is that where my daughter is?

Is she on the boat?
Tell me where my daughter is!

NOPD, drop your weapon!
Oh. God!

Help me!
Shut up.

Put the gun down, now!
I can't do that, chief.

I am not asking!

All right, gun down, hands up.
Boss, you running everything.

Just know I got a little hitch here.
I don't care!

I understand you don't care,
but I gotta care.

I'm just letting you know I'm complying,
okay?

You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...

Ah!

Wait.
What now?

Robin!

Robin told me to tell you something.

She said every moment
comes with invisible decisions.

She told me to tell you about mine rats
and seismographs...

Man it was long.
It was about decisions,

but in the end she said, "Am I lying?"

What the hell are you doing here?
I got worried.

Shit, is that Biggie?

Go, go, go! Get her out of here!

You okay?
Hell, no.

Jesus.

You're under arrest.

Frank, we gotta help him.
You already did help him.

You brought him here.
Are you not paying attention?

He's using you.

What, and you don't?

At least he's being honest about it.

Come on. Art, tell him what you told me.

Go home.

No, come on, please, you can't give up.
I said...

go home.
You cannot give up!

Do I look like your daddy or something?

It's okay, all right?

Frank!

Down in the basement!
You gotta help him.

He'll never find his daughter
if you arrest him.

Well, you're both a bunch of cowards!

Frank!

<i>You've reached the voicemail</i>
<i>of Captain Craine</i>

<i>of the New Orleans Police Department.
Please leave a mess...</i>

Captain, I got the guy.

I'm bringing him in. Call me back.

You're making a big mistake.

Uh-huh. Let me guess,Â you're one
of the good drug dealers, right?

You're trying to save the world.

They have my daughter.

That is my world.

Listen, it ain't too late
for you to walk away.

I don't know, man.

You're the one in handcuffs,
and I'm literally in the driver's seat,

so what am I missing?

What you're missing is

in the next 30 seconds,
your captain is gonna call you

and tell you to take me
to a different place, not the precinct.

But we're never gonna make it
to that place.

Oh yeah? Why is that?

Think about what you've seen.

Testing in New Orleans.

Why?

Local authorities on payroll.

Why?

And then your captain
sends out a single cop

to apprehend the most dangerous man
in the city. Why?

Because he's taking orders
from someone else.

And I can also tell you
that that van over there...

ain't delivering newspapers.

This what's gonna happen.

They gonna kill you,
and then they gonna take me.

Now, I'm okay
with that second part of this

if it gets me to my daughter sooner.

What are they doing here?
Doing field testing.

If they can stabilize it,
then they'll mass produce it.

So whatever's happening here
is gonna start happening everywhere.

And what?
Your kid has something to do with it?

Where do you think
they got the formula from?

What do you need?

This ain't your fight.

It's my city.

They think they can just test their shit
on the people of New Orleans

and no one's gonna care,
no one's gonna fight them on it?

Well, let 'em see what happens.
What do you need?

You still got them pills on you?

<i>What happened to the cop?</i>

<i>Get the Major to A deck.</i>

<i>I want all personnel and cargo loaded
ASAP.</i>

<i>The Genesis leaves tonight.</i>

What the hell are you doing here?
I told you...

You scared me half to death,
almost gave me a heart attack!

Those men have guns...
Don't be barking orders at me...

You not my daddy...
We're not having this conversation.

Come here.

They got Art.
Yeah, I know.

So you let 'em take him?

No, it was his plan. It's the only way
he can get to his daughter.

Now I gotta bust in after him.
So what are we gonna do about it?

All right, you wanna help?

You stay here.

Put this in your ear and you tell me
about what's coming and what's going.

Take it.

You're the lookout.

It's an important role.

Testing, testing, testing.

I hear you.

You got a few guards with guns
right in front of you.

Yeah, thanks.

I think you should do
the Clint Eastwood thing.

I'm not doing the Clint Eastwood thing.

How's it going?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I got a meeting upstairs.
Stay right there.

Okay.

You know who I am, right?
NOLA dock authority.

You know I don't care, right?

You heard of a harbor master?
That's my boss.

Now, if your bossÂ doesn't give my boss
ten thousand dollars,

<i>this vessel's not going anywhere.</i>

<i>- I guess that vessel's not going anywhere.</i>
He's not down, Frank.

<i>I think maybe you gotta go
with the Clint Eastwood thing.</i>

Do it.

<i>Come on, like you practiced in the mirror.</i>

Well, I guess you just gotta ask yourself
one question.

<i>Am I gonna be the guy
that makes a bad decision</i>

to send the bag man home empty-handed,

make the boss get out of bed,

start raining hellfire
on whoever's responsible?

Or am I gonna be the guy
who makes a good decision

and get the hell out of the goddamn way,

so we can all get home
in time to watch the Saints highlights?

<i>Yeah, Frank!</i>

So what's it gonna be...

punk?

I'm the punk?

Oh, did I stutter?

Wait here.

<i>I told you.</i>

Pretty good, right?

Where's Tracy?

I'm just here for Tracy.

She's safe.

Come with me.

Hey, I got an answer for you.

Thank you very much.

<i>Let's get him outta here.</i>

I know you think
what we're doing here is wrong,

but do you know the name Henrietta Lacks?

Henrietta Lacks checks into a hospital
in 1951

to have a tumor removed from her cervix,

but the doctor
doesn't just take the tumor,

he also takes healthy cells
in the process.

<i>Frank. Wait, can you hear me?</i>

<i>Frank?</i>

Hello there.

Those cells, stolen without her consent,

are the backbone
of nearly every medical advancement

in the last century.

All because someone took one look
at that woman

and saw her true potential.

Tracy's lab results are fascinating.

We're talking about permanent power,
the next step in human evolution.

All of our greatest advancements
began in darkness, Major.

It's up to the pioneers to light the way.

Well, you see,
that's the thing, Doc.

You not a pioneer.

You a drug dealer.

How about you take your science project

and you shove it up your mother...

Grab him. Get him out.

Take him below.

Salvage whatever genetic material you can
and flush the rest.

Frank.

No, you're supposed to be the lookout.

Well, you got shot.

Yeah, I know.

So what, you bulletproof?

It's cool, right?

<i>Alpha 5 to ops.</i>

<i>Open hatch 26.</i>

Shit.

Doors.
<i>- Ops, hatch 26.</i>

The doors.

Hatch 26...

Nicely done.

They're taking him below deck.

Sub level two.

Okay, so see here?

All the checkpoints
got their own security doors.

And if I press those two buttons,
the whole thing go on lockdown mode.

Yeah, that's like County.

So you're saying
you can open and close doors for me.

I mean, I think so.

Why?
Stay here.

Where you going?
I'm going after Art.

You get in any trouble, you run.
You meet me at the front of the ship.

If I can get there, I will.
If I can't, then you keep running.

But there's like a thousand guards
out there.

But you know I'm awesome, right?

Well, go be awesome then.

It's about to get real noisy.

Hey. Wrong way.

I know!

Get me Wallace.

Is the Major secure?

Got eyes on him right now.

<i>Get to ops,</i>
<i>find out why this alarm is going off.</i>

On it.

Can you hear me, Robin?

Hearing and... seeing.

Hatch 18.

<i>Merci "buckets."</i>

I got you.

All right, where am I going now?

There's another door at the other end,
to the left, down the stairs.

Alpha 1 to ops.

Pop hatch 15.

<i>Alpha 1 to ops.</i>

<i>Hatch 15, open it up.</i>

Frank, we got a problem.

Let's go.

That big dude's coming this way.
<i>- Which way?</i>

My way.

How quickly can you get us out of here?
About 15 minutes until we can release

from the dock, ma'am.
You got ten.

Let's go!

You're almost there.
<i>- Down here?</i>

Down the stairs, last door to the right.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

<i>Heading down to sub level two.</i>

Frank, I think I found her.

Can't hear you, Robin.

<i>Frank, I know where she is.</i>

You're breaking up.
What'd you say you found?

Something what?
<i>- Tracy.</i>

What you say?
<i>- You hearing me?</i>

Robin, I'm losing you.

<i>I can't hear you, Robin.</i>

Security deck, engine deck...

Lab deck.

What did you say? You found what?
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

<i>Frank, look out,
there's someone behind you!</i>

Ah!

Ah!

What the...

Frank, the door!

<i>Just get him to the door, Frank.</i>

Y'all hear that?

That's the sound

of the most advanced tactical team
in the world

taking over your ship.

<i>Frank, punch him in the nuts or something.</i>

<i>Come on, Frank. It's time to be awesome.</i>

Get ready with the door!

Close it!

Fuck!

<i>Wallace,</i>
<i>what the hell is going on down there?</i>

<i>Give me an update.</i>

Room's empty.

She took the escape hatch.

<i>She could be anywhere.</i>

<i>You get back to the Major.</i>

<i>We are ending this.</i>

<i>Somebody find that kid.</i>

We gotta move.

You got this?

You. With me.

<i>The ship is ready.</i>

Well, then get us out to sea.

Let me ask you something, big man.

What's the most powerful animal
on the planet?

Shut up.

Some people think it's the lion
'cause, you know, they big,

but it's actually the...

the pistol shrimp.

Little bitty guy, look harmless,

but hit you so fast,
it vaporizes the water around it.

Eight thousand degrees hotter
than the surface of the sun.

The shock waves,

rips the flesh right off the bone.

And when it's all over,

it's just Mr. Shrimp
sitting there, eating...

anything that's left.

Yeah, so?

So...

We get all these powers from animals,
right?

Guess what animal I got?

You made the right choice.

Smart man.

Hey! What the hell are you doing?

Get the fuck out of here!

Gotta be honest,

I was a little disappointed
we took you without a fight.

Got a lot of dead friends because of you.

Let's go.

Something funny?

Don't move!

Took you long enough.

Yeah, you're welcome.

That's disgusting, by the way. Come on.

Tracy?

I'm Robin.

I gotta get you out of here.

I'm with your dad.

I gotta bring you to him.

He's here.

Really?

He came?

I knew he'd come.

All right, I'm gonna check the other room.

No!

I want you on the deck now.
It's the only way

she can get off this damn ship.
Yes, ma'am.

<i>All security personnel</i>
<i>should be on full alert.</i>

<i>The asset is missing. Multiple intruders.
I want a full sweep of the ship.</i>

We gotta keep moving.

Was that Robin I heard?
Yeah, she's in the control room.

I think she knows where Tracy is.

Hatch 16.

Robin, hatch 16.

All right, we gotta get to the bow.

Tracy?
Robin?

Where is she? Tracy?

What's going on?

I told her anything goes wrong,
meet at the front of the boat.

Tracy.

I missed you so much.

Art.

We gotta go.

You okay?

Let's get you out of here. Come on.

How much time we got left?

Less than five, more than zero.

Still got your pill?
Yeah, I'm saving that one.

Saving it for what?

Last resort.

I got this, go!

Ah!

Get her to the lifeboat!

Come on!

Where's Robin?

I don't know.

All right, we're gonna run. Ready?

Stay with me. Go, go, go!

Come on! Your dad's right behind us.

Don't shoot the girl!

It's stuck!

Now!
Now!

Yes!

Meet me at the lifeboat.

Where's Robin?
Thought she was with you.

Major!

Stop, Major!

You see who I have here?

Get off of me!

I want Tracy out here now!

Give me the pill.
It's not gonna work on you.

It's got to be me.
No, Daddy.

You know what'll happen if you do that.
I will kill her, Arthur, right now,

right in front of you.

I love you more
than anything in the world, you hear me?

I love you, but there's no way
we're leaving her behind.

All of you out of the boat, now!

Look, if anything goes wrong,

you drop this boat down
and get out of here, okay?

All right.

I'm gonna end this.

Hold your fire.

I want Tracy out here now!

Wait.

Robin, you all right?
Don't talk to her!

Let me tell you something, Robin.

You did a great job.

You saved my daughter's life.

Now you listen up, Doc!

You got one chance.

You let her go, I let you live.

This isn't a negotiation.

No.

It's something else.

I told you what was gonna happen,
didn't I?

Now you tell me...

am I lying?

Hey.

Hey, come on Daddy.

Daddy, come on!

Daddy!

Daddy, come on!

Ah! Ah!

Daddy?

Yes! Yes!

Thank you.

Stand up.

Y'all ready?

Tracy, do you think you could heal
a gunshot wound?

<i>Good morning, New Orleans!</i>

<i>Who dat say they gon' beat dem Saints?</i>

<i>Man, it went down in the Dome last night.</i>

<i>It was even louder on the streets.</i>

<i>Did y'all hear about the two explosions
last night after the game?</i>

<i>The Coast Guard's saying
they can't find any sign of the ship,</i>

<i>and then,Â NOPD has absolutely nothing
to say about it.</i>

So what's next for you?

Well, first I think I'll have
a long talk with my captain

then maybe find a journalist
looking for their next big story.

You blow that whistle,
ain't no going back.

Yeah.

Well, let's see these assholes try to hide
when everyone knows what they're doing.

Let me ask you something.

You think this is really over?

For me, it is.

It's time to jet.

Hey, you.

Go to my truck.

Make sure you check the trunk.

You remember what I said?

There's something great inside you, Robin.

Use it.

Here.

What's this?
What's it look like?

Frank.

Why you got my mama's phone, man?

It's a long story.

Seriously.

Frank!

I love you, Ma.

I love you too.

<i>Man, I am about to beat</i>
<i>on your eardrums with this one.</i>

<i>It's the first single</i>

<i>from brand new MC Robin Reilly,
featuring Chika.</i>

<i>Let's go!</i>
