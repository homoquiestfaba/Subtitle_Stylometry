Hill, goddammit, do you copy?

Yeah, I copy. Go ahead.

Hey, there's a silver car
out here. Been here a few days.

I gave it a ticket, I don't
know, two or three days ago.

No?

Hey, you know, give
me a read on 869663h.

Yeah, I'm not finding anything.

All right, you know what?

I'm gonna go look
for the driver.

10-4, sandman.

Roger that.

Hello?!

Hello?

Hello?

Ma'am?

You know you're not
supposed to be here.

Ma'am?

Ma'am.

Are you okay?

And welcome back to
kwlf. I'm David Walker.

Following up on
our breaking news,

senator Morrison's
suicide comes on

the heels of a scathing report

by New York times
journalist Nora Thompson.

The report details
Morrison's involvement

with a drug trafficking ring

and the funneling of profits

through the Morrison family
charity, hearts of children.

Now all of the Morrison family
assets have been frozen.

And, so far, there
has been no comment

from senator Morrison's
immediate family.

Please join us tomorrow
night at 8:00 P.M.

For an hour long report

on the rise and fall
of senator Morrison.

We have uncovered more details

on senator Morrison's
illegal activity

and a special
report and interview

with Nora Thompson herself,

the New York times journalist
who exposed senator Morrison.

Coming up next, what is a
social media influencer?

Do they matter? And
how can you become one?

We'll be right back after these
messages from our sponsor.

You're watching kwlf.
I'm David Walker.

It's about time. Been trying
to get a hold of you all day.

I didn't
know. I'm sorry.

I had a family emergency. And
I did call earlier, though.

Did you? I didn't notice.

Is your family, okay?

Yeah, everything's fine.

Good because I
wouldn't want to take up

too much of your time
if you're a preoccupied.

I need someone who
makes me their priority.

Hey, you
are my priority. 100%.

How are you?

Fine. Just getting
ready for tomorrow.

Nothing I won't
be able to handle.

Between me and you,
Clay auburn is an idiot.

I don't know who would
give him an anchor seat.

We used to go to
school together.

It's good that
you know him, though.

It'll lead to friendly
banter. Audiences love that.

Oh, that reminds me. Don't
bring up the senator's suicide.

Well, duh, obviously.
I'm not an idiot.

If Clay does,
just send your condolences.

Move on as quickly as possible.

I'm not gonna
give my condolences.

If you ask me, suicide was
too easy for that bastard.

And his family knew what he
was doing the entire time.

They don't deserve well
wishes or condolences.

Nora.
I'm a professional.

If it comes up, I'll play it up.

Hell, I'll even get teary-eyed
if the mood calls for it.

Stunning.

Everything we deserve, finally.

Mm.

Ew.

Hashtag rest day.

Hashtag journalist.

Hashtag New York times.

Perfect.

This is the life.

Hello, world!

Oh, my god.

We reached 1 million followers.

Nora Thompson, you
are finally verified.

My god, it's hard
to get verified

than it is to bribe
a congressman.

Yes.

You earned your a
fancy wine, girl.

Woo!

Any news on the pulitzer board?

You're definitely
one of the front runners.

I don't want to be a
front runner. I want to win.

So make it happen.

Yes. Yeah,
I will, don't worry.

Good. I also liked
your book idea.

I think we should
move forward with it.

Oh. Oh, perfect.

Perfect, I can get started

on that tomorrow.

I don't need to
know the details.

Now, look, I have to go.

I want to finish
prepping for tomorrow

and I want to look
fresh for the cameras.

It sounds really good.

Hey, you know, I had some...

Why, yes, Clay,
it is unfortunate.

Of course...

Of course my thoughts and
prayers go out to his family.

Remember, viewers,
suicide is not the answer,

and there is help available
to those who are struggling.

That's it.

That's the one.

Cheers to you, bitch.

Happy to be here, Clay.
Thanks for having me.

Happy to be here, Clay.

Much better.

It is the only Clay
after all. Chump.

Perfect.

You deserve everything
coming to you.

Just the stupid
neighbor's cat again.

It's freezing.

Get back!

Get out!

Get out! Get back!

Get out of my house!

Hey!

Let me outta here!

Let me out, you psycho!
People will be looking for me!

No!

Did you really think
that was gonna work?

Let me out!

You.

You know who I am?

Carolyn Morrison.

Senator Morrison's
oldest daughter,

and least favorite
from what I hear.

Good. Saves me a lot of time.

Favorite or not, that
kingdom was going to be mine

till you opened your
big fucking mouth.

Fuck! Ow!

Do it again.

I have pliers.

Now, stay quiet, or I'm
really gonna give you

something to scream about.

No.
Now open your mouth.

Open your mouth.

Shit.

Shit.

Stay quiet, or I'll
really give you

something to scream about them.

I'll kill him and throw his
body back here with you.

How you doing, ma'am?
Everything all right?

Yeah. I just needed to
take a break from driving.

Nature calls.

I see.

You do know I am
supposed to cite people

for stuff like that, right?

Have a heart, officer.

You got a light?

I don't smoke.

Hey, you know, you look like
that senator's daughter,

the one who offed himself.

Wait a minute, it is you.

Caroline, Carolina,
Carolyn, Carol-

Carolyn.

Carolyn. That's right.

You're all over the TV.

That's me-
oh, yeah.

In the flesh.

Aw, gee, I'm
sorry for your loss.

I've read the story.

All that money gone and,

well, guess that's
why you're not driving

one of those fancy
gas guzzlers, right?

I guess so.

Well, miss Morrison, don't
stay out here too long,

and you have a good day.

My sincerest condolences
to your family.

Thank you, officer.

Yeah.
You too.

Hey, you got
something back there?

No, I grabbed these
from the back earlier

and something must've fallen.

You want to check, officer?

Nah, it's fine.

Once again, miss Morrison,
don't stay out here too long.

Have a good one.

Shut up.

Do you want him to die?

Enough!

What the fuck?

Get up.

All right, I'm going
to remove the rag.

If you scream, I will
cut your tongue out.

What do you want?
You want money?

I'll get you money. I'll
get you whatever you want.

What did I say?

I'm not screaming.

We're gonna take
a walk that way.

What?

I can't walk through
the woods like this.

What, you afraid you're
gonna ruin your pedicure

now you're insta famous?

Get up.

Look, I'll do whatever you
want. Just don't hurt me.

Get up. Let's go.

Where are we going?

Down the trail.

Why?

Ow, shit.
Faster.

I'm going as fast as I can.

Maybe I should retie your
legs and make you crawl.

Bitch.

What was that?
Stop stalling.

Did you hear that?

What, you've never
been in the woods before?

Aw, fuck!

You can't hide.

Fuck!

No!

Get up.

So what, you're
just gonna shoot me

and leave me for the animals?

Of course not.

Look, I'm sorry about your dad.

I didn't think-
oh, god!

I don't give a
shit about my dad.

Outside of this fur
coat that he gave me,

he can rot in the
deepest depths of hell.

Well, then the money, i-

oh, shut the fuck up!

Jesus! Let's go!

Move.

Moving as fast as I can.

All right, stop. This is good.

Look, you seem like a smart
woman. We can make a deal.

You know, my father used to
take us hunting in the woods.

Thought you didn't
care about your father.

By my house.

At least that's what
we told my mother.

He used to make us
play these games.

You know, live up to the
Morrison family name.

This one time, he sent my
brothers out on a footrace.

He handed me a rifle and he
told me to pick one and shoot.

I picked my youngest brother.

He was an annoying little shit.

So I aimed.

My father slapped it down.

He said, "you don't
put down an annoyance.

You put down the biggest threat

and you make damn sure
they know it was you."

Not only have you
embarrassed me,

not only have you taken the
inheritance that I earned,

but you are the biggest threat
to any future that I have.

And so I'm going
to eliminate you

and I'm gonna have fun doing it.

Thought you didn't
care about your father?

Old habits die hard.

You really are
crazy, you know that?

Turn around.

You won't get away with this.

People will be looking for me.

Now, we're gonna play
our own little game.

You have a one minute head start.

You can go in any
direction you like.

And I'll count down from five.

Five.

I'm not gonna get very far

in a minute.
Four.

It's not my concern.

Three.
Hold it right there!

Put the gun down, nice
and slow, miss Morrison.

You need to mind
your business, officer.

I'm eliminating a threat.

Shoot her! What
are you waiting for?!

Calm down, ma'am. I
have this under control.

We'll get you outta here.

You shoot me, I shoot her.

I got a hostage.

Now I'll give you
to the count of three

to lower your weapon.

Don't make me shoot you.

Told you to mind
your business, officer.

Come on now! Think
of your family!

You come from a good
all-American family!

Are you kidding me?!

Ma'am, please!

I'm warning you, miss
Morrison, put the gun down!

That's it.

No one needs to get hurt!

Shoot her!

Told you to leave, officer!

No! Fuck!

C'est la vie!

Wait! Don't leave me!

Also...

Hold on.

We've just received
word that Nora Thompson,

the New York times investigative
reporter, is missing.

She's missed several interviews

and no one seems to
be able to reach her

or know her whereabouts.

They're interviewing all
that are close to her

and also senator
Morrison's family.

We will have more on this
as the story develops.

Next, how safe is your hybrid?

The consumer reports
with Becca Dane.

We'll be right back.
You're watching kwlf.

I'm David Walker.

Hello?!

Hello?! Is anybody in there?!

Oh, my god, thank you.

Yes.

Yes. Yes.

Yes!

Fuck!

No. No sleep.

What the hell is that?

Ew, it's disgusting.

Fuck.

At least it's something.

Dammit.

Yes.

Okay.

Come on.

Oh, yes.

Everything's gonna be okay.

Just breathe.

Oh, fuck.

Jesus. Fuck!

Let me in.

Let me in.
And why would I do that,

you evil bitch?

I think it's on my tail.
Please, open the door.

I don't care. You
led it here, it can have you.

I'm injured.

You tried to kill me.

I'll give you dirt.

The scoop of your career.

I'll get you dirt on
every politician I know.

I grew up with the bastards.
I know all their secrets.

Please, just open the door.

And how do I know you
want to try and jump me?

It's empty.

I have nothing left.

I have nothing left.

Let me in.

Fuck. Screw it.

Come on.

Quickly, quickly

easy. Easy.

Did you get it? I
mean, did you kill it?

I think I wounded it earlier.

This is empty.

It's useless.

You don't have any more bullets?

I have more guns in the
car, but I lost the keys.

You have them?

Whoa, what's that?

Look-
what are you doing?

The way I see it, I'm
the one in charge now.

I got the keys and the knife

and I'm not afraid to
use it, you got it?

I got it.

I hold the backpack
and the weapon.

Okay.
You're in charge.

That's right.
I'm in charge now.

All right, let's
move you over there.

Come on.

Easy does it.

Oh.

Oh, this is worse
than I thought.

We need to get
you to a hospital.

Ow.

Ow! That hurts.

Hold still!

All right, relax, relax, relax.

That looks better.

All right, I'm not a doctor.

What kinda animal could do this?

Um, shouldn't you use that
to clean your wounds, maybe?

Shut up and take a drink.

Okay.

Ew, no.

That is disgustingly strong.

No thank you. Disgusting.

You know, we wouldn't be
here if it weren't for you?

You know, we wouldn't be here

if you didn't go blackmailing
hookers for intel?

I mean, it was pretty smart,

but it was painfully obvious
to those of us on the inside.

Oh, why didn't you stop me

if you knew I was onto your dad?

We're all sinners, honey.

Oh, god, what I wouldn't do
for a cigarette right now.

Smoking kills. My
body as a temple.

Oh, spare me.

I knew what girls like
you did in college.

Girls like me?
And what is that?

Oh, you know, kind with
a stick so far up their ass

when they finally
blow off steam.

It's epic.

Yeah, that might've
been me. Whatever.

Let's go.

Are you coming?

Just one...

Shit, what is that thing?

I don't know.

Never seen anything like it.
I didn't get a close look.

What about the deputy?

I think he's dead.

I don't think he survived.

Have you seen anything like
that in these woods before?

I told you, I used to hunt
by the woods near my house.

These were a suggestion
from a friend.

A friend.

Some friend.

Are you okay?

Mm? I'm fine.

Carolyn. Carolyn.

What? What?

Think you might
have hypothermia.

I'm fine.

I'm...

No, you lost a lot of blood.

Here, hold on one second.

Here.

It smells like shit,
but it'll keep you warm.

Lean up.

Is that okay?

It's fine.

You don't smell that?

Smell what?

Forget it.

I think you might be in shock.

Oh, no.

I'm in survival mode.

We need to get out of here.

How? That thing is out
there waiting for us.

We stay here,
we're sitting ducks.

It's gonna come find us.

I think we should
wait it out here.

And wait for it to get us?

How do I know that
you won't jump me

once we get out there?

Leave me for dead?

You have the keys.

And I, I don't have
the strength to fight you.

Is there food?

No. The cabinets were empty.

Wait.

What are you doing?

Nothing. Nothing.

You were just...

Forget it.

Here.

We should at least try and
dress some of those wounds.

They look disgusting.

At least it'll help you

stop bleeding.
Jerky?

What are you doing?

Mm. I haven't eaten
since this morning.

What was that?

What?

Oh, it must be back.

Hello?
Is anyone in there?

I need help. Please!

Oh, my god, it's the deputy.

He must've gotten away.
We have to help him.

No, I'm not going out there.

I thought you don't leave
any people or hunters behind.

That's the marines.

If you want to help
him, you go right ahead.

Fuck.

Okay, I'm gonna go out there
and help him. You wait here.

Hello?

Deputy?

Help!

Is anyone there?!

Hello?

Hello?

Please, help me.

Deputy?

Come here, please!

Help!

Deputy?

Please, help me!

Is anyone there?!

Deputy?!

Over here!

Where are you?!

Please, help me!

I'm coming!

Please!

Help!

Deputy!

Deputy?!

Deputy!

Deputy?!

Deputy!

Deputy!

Help!

Deputy!
Please!

Please!

Where are you?!

Over here!

Deputy!

Please!

Help me!

Where are you?!

Carolyn, open the door!

It is coming! Let me in!

Please, let me in! He's coming!

Carolyn, what are you
doing?! Let me in!

What are you doing?!

Come on!

Carolyn, open the door!

Let me in!

What are you doing?!

It's coming!

Carolyn, open the door!

What are you doing?!

Where the hell did
that come from?

I found it in
the closet earlier.

You said you had my gun.

Shit.

How does it feel to be hunted?

Excuse me?

That article you wrote,
that's how my family and I felt.

Look, I'm sorry.

Oh, god.

Come on. Come with me.

Take a look at that.

Okay, so what's the plan?

Why are you asking me?

I figured you had more
experience with stuff like this?

We run for the road and
drive off as fast as we can.

Swell. And you sure
you're up to the challenge?

I'm fine. It's
just a flesh wound.

Fuck. It's back.

So how do you wanna do this?

We've gotta move.

Here, take it. You're
gonna need this.

I found it in the
closet with the shotgun.

Okay.

It's a gun.
That's the trigger.

Put your finger on
it and you pull.

Great. Thanks.

We sprint for the car. If
you see the creature, shoot.

What are you doing?

I look like shit.

It's a good thing
it's not a beauty contest.

Oh, my gosh, I know.

Okay.

I don't see it.

There's no eyes.

Let's do this. Stay close.

Don't run off without me.

Are you sure you're okay?

I'm fine.

How much...

Shh, shh! You'll
lead it right to us.

Don't ever touch me again.

Oh, fuck.

You'll give our position away.

I fell onto a dead mangled
body, what do you expect?

Calm down.

You calm down.

Oh, shut up.

It can mimic people.

Yeah, looks like it.

What are you doing?

Trying to find something useful.

You gonna stand there and
watch or are you gonna help?

I'm not touching him.

Snowflake.

Sorry we didn't all
grow up with a psycho dad.

There's no gun. Fuck.

He probably lost
it in the attack.

Look for his keys. He
probably has more in the car.

Good idea.

Ah. Bingo.

Nice.

Are you sure you're okay?

Yeah.

Just asking.

What?
Run!

Wait!

Fuck! That bitch!

Which way?

Carolyn!

Carolyn!

Shh.

I think it's gone.

Yeah, I think you're right.

Think the coast is clear.

What? What's wrong?

Is it your cut?

No.

I'm starving.

All right, well, we'll get you

a steak when we get outta here.

Let's just get outta here, okay?

Give me the knife.

Why?
Just give me the damn knife.

Look, if you try something,

I will scream as loud as I can

and bring that monster
right to us, okay?

Okay. Just give it.

If I die, you die.

Okay, okay.
Got it?

Give me the knife.

You see something, run.

Just hurry up.

Carolyn, what are you doing?

Stop it! Carolyn!

Stop it! What are you doing?!

Please, stop.

It's not enough.

You're sick! Stop it!

Carolyn.
It's not enough.

What?

Stay back.

It's not enough!
Stop!

Get off of me!

Die, you fucking bitch!

Die!

Die!

Die!

Fuck!

Rot in hell, you fucking bitch.

Stop fighting, Nora.

Stop fighting, Nora.

Become one of us.

Hey, home base,

doesn't look like
anybody's back here.

Hello?

Hello?

Whoa, man. Oh, hey!

Oh, my god, oh, my god.
Help me.

God.
Please, please, help me.

All right. All right.

Yeah. No, no, no.

Please-
what happened to you?

We have to go! We
have to go now, okay?!

Do you hear me?!
Can you stand up for me?

Come here, come here.

Okay, okay.

No. Come on.

Come here.

I'm gonna put you
right here, okay?

Okay?
We have to leave.

All right.
Yes, we're leaving.

We're leaving.
We have to leave.

We're gonna get you back
to the station, all right?

Know what? We're gonna
get you to a medic.

We're going. We're going.

Listen, we're gonna
get you to the station.

We're gonna get
you to the station.

We're gonna see a medic, okay?
It's coming!

Please, let's go.
What's coming, ma'am?

It's coming!
Okay, yes, yes, we're going.

We're going. We're going.

Go in. Go in.

All right.

Stay here.

Ma'am, I just checked it out.

It's just to deer or
something, all right?

Everything's gonna be okay.

What's wrong, ma'am?
What's out there, ma'am?

Ma'am?

Ma'am?

I'm hungry.

Welcome back. Breaking news.

As we reported a few days ago,

Nora Thompson, the
journalist who uncovered

senator Morrison's charity
scandal, has gone missing.

There's still no sign of
the New York times reporter.

She disappeared over a week ago

when she was expected
to make an appearance

on several news outlets,
including our very own.

Police believe foul
play is involved.

Once again, the Morrison
family has denied

any involvement with
her disappearance.

Coming up, weather
with windy breeze.
