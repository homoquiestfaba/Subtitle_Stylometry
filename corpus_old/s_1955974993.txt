Come. Come through please.

Move! Over there!

Everybody,
this is a hijack situation!

Nobody move!

Nobody move!
If you all stay in your seats

and do not move,
no one will be harmed.

But if anybody tries anything,
I will throw this grenade.

Nobody move!
Everyone stay in your seat!

Don't move! I have a bomb!

Sit down!

Sit! Sit!

We've got the cabin
under control.

It's four of us.

We've got weapons and bombs.

If you try anything,
you will die.

Comrade 39,
is the cabin secured?

Cabin secured.
Stay in your seats,

and nobody try anything.

Everyone in here, get into
the back cabin now. Move!

Take nothing with you.
Move, move!

Who's the captain?

I am.
You two, out.

I'm the flight engineer.
I'm-I'm needed here.

You, up.

Move! Hurry, hurry!

Come on. Come on!
Leave your bags. Go!

Faster!
Come on, go!

And you, too.

Okay, okay, okay.

Faster! Come on!

<i>If we don't have good schools,</i>

<i>a good health system...
if we don't invest</i>

in our own culture,
what are we fighting for?

We cannot allocate
all the taxpayers' money

to your ministry, Shimon.

The defense budget
is already 31% of the GDP.

A raise of ten percent
in four years.

In my personal assessment,

a ten-percent increase
in military spending

is the minimum that we need.

Anything less would be
a dereliction of our duty.

Now, this is not about
a choice, gentlemen.

This is compulsory.

This is about the survival
of Israel.

As the Yom Kippur War proved,
our intelligence capabilities

are also lacking.

We don't have the assets
on the ground.

We need more agents.

We need to buy more influence.

The Russians
have massively increased

military aid to Egypt.

Syria is also re-arming.

There are
Russian military personnel

back in the Golan Heights.

It is not just tanks
and airplanes.

Also, capabilities are lacking.

If we are caught
off guard again,

the consequences
will be catastrophic.

In my assessment, Russia...

This is compulsory.

This is about the ten percent
that we need.

We cannot allocate money
to health and education

when we are being driven
into the sea by our enemies.

You're required to hand over

all documents that give
evidence of your identity.

Anyone who is caught
holding back any papers

will be punished without mercy.

<i>Come on, everyone, give me</i>

<i>your passport
and I.D. card, too.</i>

Passport. Passport.

Passport. I.D.

Come on, give me
your I.D. card, too.

Okay.

Passport.

There are 239 passengers
on board.

83 are Israeli.

Legally, it's a French problem.

It's their airliner
and mostly their citizens.

If it's a hijack,
we'll make sure

the press understands that.

I can call the editors.

It's a hijack.

They'll fly back here
to challenge us.

They always do.

Amos, Prime Minister...

this is our problem.

You mean it's my problem,
Shimon?

Uh...
Sit down.

No, excuse me, but...
Sit down.

My daughter really needs
to go to the bathroom.

You?

Yeah.

You need to go?

Hurry up.

I need to go, too.
You can stay sitting down.

Miss...

Your blouse is open.

Don't try and break
the undercarriage.

If you do, we'll die together.

Don't worry.
I'll do a kiss landing.

Reverse.

Check.

Good, Captain.

Why is this taking so long?

Unless you tell me
where we're going,

I'm going to need
five or six of these.

Okay.

Get back inside the plane.

If you want to fly on
and if you want to be safe,

I-I need to do
my pre-flight checks.

I need to check the wheels,
the brakes and the engine.

You should be taking care
of those people inside.

They've been on this plane
five hours now.

They need food and drinks.

You will run.

You have my word, I won't.

And you don't want
to be holding that

next to a fuel truck.

Are you a member
of Baader-Meinhof?

Fill up the plane, engineer.

Do your job.

Jaber.

Brigitte, Juan Pablo.
Hello.

Hijacking a plane?

That is a serious step.

What's in it for us?

Let's just see
what Jaber has to say.

Sit.

Your movement
is under pressure.

Your support is fading.

Many of your colleagues
are in jail.

An action like this can inspire
a new generation to follow you.

The PFLP will call
for the release

of 50 Palestinian prisoners.

We could also demand the
release of some of our friends.

If we do this,
we can demand anything we want.

We can demand that
Ulrike Meinhof is on the list?

They will never release Ulrike.

Like I said,

if we do this right,

they have to do
whatever we want.

Aim!

Fire!

Bose!

We need to talk.

Ulrike Meinhof is dead.

She killed herself.

Your movement is dying.

She cut her hair.

No, she quit.

And that poses a problem.

Which problem?

His father and his mother.

His sister and his wife,
and their children.

They were all in a camp
in Lebanon.

The Israelis raided it.

Killed people,
dynamited the houses.

They tried to escape.

They were in a car.
An Israeli tank drove over it.

All of them died.

That's how I know
that he's committed.

How do I know
that you're committed

now your comrades are dead?

She would never hang herself.

She was murdered by the state.

And if we return to Germany,
we will be murdered, too.

It's all the more important
that we continue.

For Ulrike.
And for your family.

At the airport,
Jaber will be in command.

I will stay in Kampala
and liaise with President Amin.

Ugandans will control
the perimeter

of the airfield
and the building.

You will all stay inside.

You must be careful
in these situations.

You must keep your distance
from the passengers.

Emotional attachment
can be really dangerous.

Particularly for women.

I am a revolutionary.

Would you like some water?

Would you like some water?
Would you like some water?

Would you like some water
for the kids?

Would you like some water?

I don't feel well.

What do you need?

I-I'm pregnant.

I think I'm having
a miscarriage.

Okay, I'm going to try to find you a doctor, okay?
Yeah.

Miss? She doesn't feel well.

She really needs
to see a doctor.

What is the problem?

She thinks
she's losing her baby.

Uh, miss, I'm a nurse.

Maybe I can help.
You can wait.

Which month?

Two... two months.

Where you from?

England.

We will call an ambulance.

We don't want to hurt anyone.

We're humanitarians.

Come with me.

She's fooling you.

It's better to show mercy,
comrade.

I'm losing my baby.

Good luck.

No radio.
We have to speak

to air traffic control
for clearance.

The runway's empty.
They know we're leaving.

Just take off.
We need to know we're...

Take off!

Set thrust.

Set.

The Libyans refueled them
and let them take off again.

Gaddafi doesn't want this
to be his problem, either.

How much fuel?

At least five hours.

Tel Aviv is in range.

They'll land at Ben Gurion.

They want the world to watch.

There is one other thing.

They released a passenger.

<i>Uh, there were two Arabs.</i>

Palestinians, I think.

And two Germans.

A man and a woman.

Why did they let you
off the plane?

I lied.

I told them I was pregnant.

Did they say
where they are going?

<i>This whole
operation is nonsense.</i>

We never talked
about going to Uganda.

Idi Amin... he's crazy.

He eats people.

He feeds them
to the crocodiles.

We're putting our lives
in the hands of a lunatic.

Once we get to Uganda,
we are safe.

The Israelis have no choice.

They have to negotiate.

It's checkmate.

And what happens
if they don't negotiate?

They...

They...

They have to.

Or we kill the hostages.

Yes.

You will have to kill people.

Germans killing Jews...
have you thought about that?

Ulrike Meinhof is dead
because of me.

That is not true.
It's true.

I trusted someone
I shouldn't have,

and she was arrested,
and now she is dead.

If you're having doubts...

you should leave.

Do you want me to leave?

<i>Welcome to Entebbe, Uganda.</i>

<i>I haven't had the time
up until now</i>

<i>to explain the reasons</i>

<i>for hijacking
an Air France plane.</i>

Despite the belief of many

that France
has a pro-Arab policy,

it is one
of the first countries

in the rank
of Palestinian enemies.

France has cooperated
with Mossad.

France has sold planes
to Israel.

France has given Israel help
in building atom bombs.

Palestine has no atom bombs,
no army and no weapons.

The Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine

must utilize other means

<i>to focus the attention
of the world</i>

<i>on the Palestinian people's
struggle.</i>

We call upon revolutionary
movements everywhere

to unite against Israel,

a fascist, Zionist
and racist state.

Israel has exploited

the humanistic sentiments
of its people

to inhuman ends.

She's the heir of Nazism.

I would ask
that you remain calm.

We will not do you any harm.

And we will not kill you.

<i>We are not assassins.</i>

<i>And we do not want to
commit a pointless massacre.</i>

You will spend tonight
on the plane.

Tomorrow,
we move to the terminal.

We know you have
a choice of airlines.

Thank you for flying
Air France.

We hope to see you again
very soon.

Now you know how the mind

of a crazy
German revolutionary works.

Captain.

Open the door.

Get back.
Mind the step.

This is the biggest plane
this airport has ever seen.

Boni, you should see the faces

of the passengers
after your speech.

What?

They are terrified.

What did he say?
You don't want to know.

Hey.
Hey.

Welcome to Uganda.

I am His Excellency al-Hajji

Field Marshal Doctor
Idi Amin Dada,

holder of
the British Victoria Cross,

DSO, CMV, MC,

appointed by God Almighty
as your savior!

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

I am the hero of Africa.

And I am your hero.

We will take care
of your every need.

And we hope very much
that you will enjoy

your stay
in our beautiful country.

And everything
will be taken care of.

You are in good hands.

Please, please, step inside.

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

Come on.

Yeah.

We did it.

Well done. Well done.

When do we start to negotiate?

Relax, comrade.

You've done a good job.

It's up to us now.

And we know the Israelis
very well.

We know how they think,

how they operate,
how they work.

We will handle
the negotiations.

If you have any problems,
just talk to Jaber. Jaber.

Your job is to watch
the passengers.

Both of you.

4,000 kilometers.

No hijacker has ever
taken a plane this far away

from the operational sphere
of our armed forces.

It must be Haddad.

Prime Minister,
you can't give in,

or every Israeli they target

will be taken
to another country.

Defense Minister,
your job is to come up

with military options
for going to Africa.

Once you have a viable one,
I'll decide what to do.

Any questions?

Amos will coordinate
an emergency committee.

As soon as we get the demands,
we will meet again.

<i>You know,
this is not Peres' problem.</i>

It's your face on the front
of every newspaper.

If it's Haddad,
he's going to demand

the release of every terrorist
in our jails.

Well, you can't release them.

That's political suicide.

I know that.

How is this going to work?

How is this going to work?

This place is filthy.
We got children here.

I'll have it cleaned.

And they'll bring mattresses.

It's all going to be fine.

Don't worry.

Why should I believe
a crazy German revolutionary?

Everything will become clear.

Everything.

Turn it back on.

Do you still sleep
with your lights on?

Go to bed.

<i>Ja.</i>

<i>Israel is a fascist state,</i>

and true anti-fascism means
clear and simple solidarity

with the Palestinians.

Stop quoting these slogans.

Germans hijacking
a planeload of Israelis.

Jews. How do you think
the world's going to react?

You know, the only thing that
we have to face is the fact

that German people
cannot analyze

the conflict in the Near East

because we are all
paralyzed by guilt.

West Germany is
a fascist society, Juan Pablo.

Perhaps it doesn't
appear so to you,

but those who are in charge
are the same ones

who were in charge
under Nazism.

And their guilt
has provided the funds

which have allowed Israel
to develop

into an imperialist
military base.

We can't just read these books.

We need to become them.

Annihilation
is for adolescents.

There's a right of revolution

against political oppression
and social injustice.

You are not oppressed.
You have a business.

There's a right of revolution
against capitalism.

You are a capitalist.

A bourgeois. We all are.

If that is what you think,
then we have to act,

and we have to act now.

I do not know what you
are scared of, Juan Pablo.

I'm not scared of anything.

But maybe you should be.

I only fear a life
without meaning.

Can I help you, madam?

I'm sorry,
I don't speak German.

Just try... try to breathe.

Now, listen.

No, no.

No, please...
please don't do that.

No, wh-what are you doing?

No.

Okay. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

Please. I-I don't understand
what you're saying, but...

Listen. Please calm down.

Just calm down. Calm down.

I don't understand
what she's saying.

Two Germans.

Yes.

You said.

They'll be revolutionaries.

Seven hours now, no news.

This time, it's different.

They are doing
what they are doing, Yitzhak.

There is nothing
you can do about it.

Get some sleep.

<i>Any rescue force</i>

<i>would have to approach
the old terminal unnoticed.</i>

Look, we can put the men
on a Hercules

and land at the airport
at night.

Without runway lights?
Yeah.

That's great.

I don't think Rabin
will go for that.

What if we drop a small
parachute force instead?

Uh, parachute force

would be dispersed
over too large an area.

So we could use Lake Victoria.

Either parachute in
with inflatable boats at night,

or cross from Kenya.

Ehud, there are crocodiles
in Lake Victoria.

Plus, it's impossible to come
all the way across the lake

from Kenya
in rubber boats unnoticed.

This is not a drill, okay?

It's the real world.

Motta, why don't we send in
the commandos,

take the airport, and then wait
to hear from Amin?

Well...

if you want to take control
of the airport,

you're gonna have to use
a much bigger force.

Could you run some numbers
for me?

I want to present
a plan tomorrow.

Also, call special forces
unit to base.

Of course, Defense Minister.

Thank you.

No problem.

I think I know why Rabin
wanted Motta here.

He wants to stop us
from coming up

with a viable military option.

That way, he doesn't have
to make a decision.

He wants to blame you
for this crisis.

That's politics.

You know,
I wish I could do that.

There was a phone call.

They want you back
at base tomorrow.

When is the premiere?

It's not about that.

You know I have
no choice here, right?

Sarah, I have to go.
It's my job.

There's always a choice.

That's not true.

What choice
do those hostages have?

If you think
you have no choice,

you're a hostage, too.

Sarah.

Dancing, it's like life.

You get hurt, you retract.
That's okay.

But if you become so afraid
that you're always guarded

and never take a leap of faith,

you won't be able to dance.

Again.

From the beginning.

<i>Ja.</i>

Listen.

All of you over here, stand up.

Everyone, close your books,
put your cards down.

It's time to move now.
And come over here.

Come on, hurry up.
You have to... we need you

to take all your belongings,
move over there.

Move the chairs, everything.
It's all good.

It's all good.
Move, move, move.

Thank you.
Move off in an orderly way. And the jacket?

Whose jacket is that?
Please move everything.

Leave nothing behind.
Listen, we're doing this

to create more space.
It's all good.

It's too crowded in here.

Okay?

When you hear your name,
you stand up,

come collect your passport
and go to the other room.

Almog, Ezra.

Cohen, Pasco.

Come on, come on.

Fast, fast, fast. Come here.

Steinberg, Mark.

Abrams, Isaac.

Rubens, Michael.

Your Front for the Liberation
of Palestine passport.

June, Ladis.
Go through the hole.

Open your bag. Open your bag.

Bergman, Aaron.

Hurry up. Hurry up.

What is this?

Everybody.

Come on, come on, come on.

Bloch, Dora.

Cohen, Hanna.

No. Uh, excuse me.
No, no, I-I have children.

I can't leave my children.

Hurry up. Hurry up!
I must protest at this.

No, you can't be doing this.
This is wrong.

She can't leave her children.
It's impossible. - Hey, hey!

Shut up! Sit!

Move! Down!

Down! Down! Shut up!

We didn't agree to this.

Watch the passengers.
I'm not a Nazi.

Watch the passengers!
Hey! Sit down! Hey!

I want to talk to Haddad.

Later.
We talk about this now.

We talk about this now!
Watch the passengers.

We'll talk about this later.

Now, shut the fuck up,
all of you!

Anyone who tries to resist me
will be shot.

Do you understand?

All of you. Now.

Hartuv, Ilan.

Next.

Mayet, Sala.

Mayet, Abraham.

Elbaz, Maurice.

Ullman, Rebecca.

Israeli?

Why do you have French passport
and Israeli I.D. card?

Well, I-I'm a French citizen.

I was working in Israel,

and, uh, I've got
that I.D. card,

which I handed in
with my passport.

You are soldier.

No, I'm French. I, uh...

You are spy.

Wait.
No, I-I'm a French citizen.

All right.

Move. Move!
Okay.

He's French.

He is your friend?

Yes.
Then you go through there, too.

For this plan to succeed,

we need to use
a big enough force

to seize control
of the airport.

First, we use the commandos,
kill the terrorists,

secure the hostages.

Then we fly in reinforcements.

Heavy weaponry,
at least 1,000 men.

You want to invade Uganda,
Shimon?

Oh, we give it back to them
when we leave.

We cannot invade a country
that is a member

of the UN
and the African League.

And it's impossible to move
a force of that size

4,000 kilometers undetected.

We have to act.

There can be no negotiations
with terrorists.

I'm talking to
the chief of staff, Shimon.

The soldier,
not the politician.

I have to agree
with the prime minister.

We need to find out
if Amin is helping them.

You were in Uganda, right?
You dealt with him?

I trained his army, yes.

I'd like to assume he's not
gonna declare war on France.

Having said that,
the man is absolutely crazy.

He might have a dream,
some kind of a vision,

and anything can happen.

I can try... call him.

If Amin is on
the terrorists' side,

we may have to negotiate.

Prime Minister, they
are asking for 52 terrorists.

Israel cannot capitulate.
It cannot.

They're going to start
killing the hostages

the day after tomorrow.

Call Amin.

I want to know
where he stands.

They have moved
the Jews together

at the old terminal at Entebbe.

They have surrounded them
with high explosives.

They have TNT on the plane
and all around the building,

even on their bodies.

They said that they will commit
suicide with the hostages.

Tell your government
there is nothing I can do.

But, Your Excellency,
this is your country.

You have an opportunity

to go down in history
as a great man.

The man who saved these people.

This is a-a great
opportunity, sir,

given to you by God.

All the terrorists want
is for you

to send your prisoners here.

Don't listen to those from
the PFLP sitting beside you.

You are offending me,
old friend.

All I'm trying to do

is make sure
the hostages are safe.

I'm sorry, Your Excellency,

but please consider
what I'm saying.

Don't miss this opportunity

to show the people
who say bad things about you

what a great man you are.

Actually, I-I think this will

get you the Nobel Prize
for peace.

Uh, Y-Your Highness?

Y-Your Highness?

Why would the PFLP want us

to fly their prisoners
to Uganda?

I think that's Amin,
not the Palestinians.

He wants to be there when
the prisoners are released.

He wants to show the Soviets
and the Arabs

that he is with them now.

He wants their approval,
their support, their arms.

The $5 million.

If the Ugandans
are with the terrorists,

this operation
will have to be even bigger.

I spoke to Kissinger.

He said it's better
if everybody dies

than we negotiate.

Yeah, well,
if it's not a French problem,

then it's even less
of an American problem, Shimon.

Let's do
the only thing we can do.

No, wait. Please.

Yitzhak.

Shimon, let me explain
the situation as it stands.

We have no intelligence.

We only know the hostages
are in the terminal.

Nothing else.

What if they moved
them around last night?

What if now
we have people sitting

in the middle of them
with guns and grenades?

As soon as they know
we're coming,

they start to kill the men,
the women, the children.

So they are selecting Jews,
and you want to negotiate.

Shimon...

if we don't negotiate,
if we never negotiate,

if we're always at war,

then we will make
our country a prison,

and every one of our citizens
will be a prisoner.

Our enemies are our neighbors.

We can't get away from them.

One day, we have to talk
and to make peace.

Thank you, gentlemen.

How did they know
you were here?

He guessed.

The spirits warned my mother

I should never offend
the Israelis.

We should listen to my mother.

To your mother?

Release some of the hostages.

It will appease the French

and make things easier
at the airport.

<i>Scheisse.</i>

Here.

This is Idi Amin's car.

Now, all the officials
in Uganda

use a black Mercedes limousine.

Right.

If we approached
the terminal in one,

the terrorists
would think Amin

is coming to talk
to the hostages.

That gives us
the element of surprise.

Get me a limo there,
we'll get the job done.

Benny?

What do you think?

We can put the Mercedes
in a Hercules

with Sayeret Matkal,

land the plane
at the new terminal.

Good.
They drive the Mercedes

to the old terminal,
kill the terrorists,

put the hostages on a plane,
fly back.

Perfect.
Now, to do that,

we need to control
the whole area.

Both terminals.

And what do you need?

Three companies of soldiers...

Dan, please.

Two companies of soldiers,

armor and heavy weapons.

That will be four planes.
Right. Move fast.

Keep all units on alert.

Rabin is already talking
to the French.

Okay, we have new orders.
Come down.

Let's go.

<i>Yes, yes.</i>

Please.

We wish you a pleasant journey.

Come and enter the bus.
Enter the bus.

And when you arrive
at your destination,

please tell them

that the president of Uganda
guaranteed your safety.

Ah. Mother, I'm your friend.

Please say a prayer for us.
I don't want to leave.

I would like to offer my place
to one of the Israeli people

who are being held.

That will not be possible.

I am not going to go.

Please get inside the bus.

No, I'm not going to go.

She's confused.

Please help her
get inside the bus.

No. I'm going to stay.
Help her.

Help her.
Get in, madam.

No, I-I want to stay.
Get in. Get in.

Please. I-I want to stay.

Please.
Get in.

Shalom.

I am afraid I'm not
the bearer of glad tidings.

I promised I would do
everything in my power

to have you released.

But they haven't heard
from your government yet.

The deadline is 24 hours away.

I'm very worried about you.

These men bear no grudge
against you.

Only against your fascist
Israeli government.

But if your government
do not negotiate,

they will kill two children

every 24 hours.

Starting with these two.

How can you do this?

Standing here
with your machine gun.

These are little children.

We have soldiers.

If you have to fight,
you fight our soldiers.

I don't want a coffee.

Zeev, you have a phone call.

Just wish I could be there.

You can't make it?

I got the part I wanted.

Hey, that's great.

I'm happy for you.

Will you be safe?

Don't want to talk about that.

Have you been thinking of me?

No, I mean, you know, it...

Sarah, people you love,
sometimes...

thinking of them, it, um...

it doesn't help.

Yeah.

I know what you mean.

Have you been practicing
on your shooting range?

Yes.

Every day.

Good.

Who was that?

It was my girlfriend.

Is she in the military?

No, she's not.

If you want to be with her,

you need to get her
to join the army.

Otherwise, it's better
you leave her alone.

What do you mean?

I mean exactly what I said.

Trust me, I know.

<i>The Palestinian hijackers</i>

released 48 of their hostage
airline passengers.

But they stood nervously
holding machine guns

on the remaining 209
and threatened to kill them all

and to blow up
the French airliner

unless their demands are met.

<i>The 48 passengers they let go
left for Paris,</i>

<i>where they arrived
a short time ago.</i>

<i>John Palmer was there
at the airport.</i>

<i>The VIP lounge
here at Orly Airport</i>

<i>has been cordoned off
by police,</i>

<i>and the waiting room inside</i>

<i>crowded with many relatives
and friends</i>

<i>waiting to greet
the newly released hostages.</i>

<i>Many of them, of course,
all of them on this flight,</i>

<i>consider themselves
very lucky indeed to be alive.</i>

Excuse me.

You must know how this looks
to the rest of the world.

Yeah.

I know how this looks.

But it's not the reality.

I'm not responsible for
the actions of my compatriots.

You are repeating
their actions.

No, I'm not.
I'm not the oppressor.

I believe in the rights
of the Palestinian people.

They have no homeland.

Have you ever seen
a Palestinian refugee camp?

Have you seen
how these people live?

Have you seen their children?

So, for them, you are willing

to exterminate
those people down there?

We have to help them.

What do you do?
What's your job?

You're not a soldier.

I'm a publisher.

I publish revolutionary texts.

Have you ever published
any books about plumbing?

Not yet.

Dignity...

is all people want.

Dignity comes when you're free.

Running water makes you free.

Toilet...

makes you free.

One plumber
is worth ten revolutionaries.

Do you ever think
you're wasting your life?

No.

Do you?

I'm an engineer.

I can make things.

One engineer
is worth 50 revolutionaries.

Jaber. What is this?

A holiday camp now?

They are children, Halima.

<i>The pressure on</i>

<i>the Israeli government
was tremendous,</i>

<i>especially from
within the country.</i>

<i>Relatives of
the Israeli hostages</i>

<i>held an emotional meeting</i>

<i>with government
representatives this morning.</i>

<i>They didn't care that Israel
has a basic policy</i>

<i>of not dealing
with terrorists.</i>

<i>Late in the morning,</i>

<i>they stormed
the government compound,</i>

<i>overwhelming military police,</i>

<i>in an effort to get
at Prime Minister Rabin</i>

<i>and tell him what they thought.</i>

We want answers!
We cannot leave them there!

The families
want the hostages released.

But as an Israeli politician,

you can't afford
to negotiate with terrorists.

That's right.

That's what I've become.

Prime Minister!

Prime Minister Rabin!

We want to speak with
the prime minister.

Stop!
We want to speak with the prime minister.

He owes us an explanation.

We want to see
the prime minister.

Wait here.

Everybody, calm down.

We need an explanation!

Mr. Ambassador,
this is the prime minister.

I would like you
to tell the French

that we're going to make
an offer to the terrorists.

To everyone's surprise,
the Israelis today

reversed their normal policy

and agreed to negotiate
with the hijackers.

The hijackers put off their
deadline to 8:00 a.m. Sunday

after Israel broke
its long-standing policy

and agreed to negotiate.

The difference of opinion
in Israel

is not over whether the
hostages should be released,

but over whether releasing
terrorists from jail here

is too high a price
to pay for it.

<i>Tonight, a special series
of prayers began</i>

<i>at the Western Wall
and at most synagogues.</i>

<i>Prayers which expressed
the hope that the government</i>

<i>made the right decision
on the negotiations</i>

<i>and that the Israeli
and Jewish hostages</i>

<i>will indeed come out
of Uganda safely.</i>

What the hell are you doing?
What?

You left your gun
lying on the wall.

One of the Jews
could have picked it up.

Relax, man.
The Israelis have surrendered.

They have not surrendered.

What if this is a trick?

What if they are buying
more time?

We have to be ready.
Okay, okay.

Why are you here?

I want to throw bombs

into the consciousness
of the masses.

And what if you have to throw
a real bomb, my friend?

Have you killed?

You think you can do it?

You choose to pick up arms
and fight.

You choose to come here.

You could have
a nice life in Europe.

I wish I had your life.

I would not pick up a gun.

Only people with nothing
understand.

The Jews understand.

When your people
massacred them,

the ones who survived
had nothing.

They brought their dead
to Palestine.

They brought
their shame and humiliation.

They did what was done to them
to us.

But I didn't do it to them.

You did it to them.

You are here because
you hate your country.

I'm here because I love mine.

Are you ready to kill?

Are you ready to die?

If this negotiation
is a trick,

we start killing immediately.

Immediately.

We can fly down
over the Red Sea

at low level
to avoid enemy radar.

When the last plane
leaves at 23:45,

the runway lights stay on
for 15 minutes.

That's our window.
Mm.

The Ugandan soldiers
have nothing at stake.

Once they see us
when we get there,

they will start running.
Just a second there.

You said you didn't have
enough fuel, right?

This is crucial.

Yeah, we're gonna have
to refuel on our way back home.

Sir, Kenya will be
the best place to do it.

Motta.

This operation
is not gonna succeed.

This is a charade, okay?
This... it's fantasy.

The Germans separated the Jews.

Selection, Motta.

We can't just sit here,
do nothing.

These are my men.

If they die,
it's my responsibility.

No, Motta.
They are Israeli soldiers.

It's the prime minister's
responsibility.

Are you going to back me up
on this, Motta?

Good morning.
Good morning.

They're negotiating.

You think they're gonna
call you back?

I don't think the operation's
gonna be approved, but...

we have to practice.

Why does it have to be you?

How many times
are we gonna talk about this?

We can't just be at war
all the time.

You're not at war all the time.
You're a dancer.

I fight so you can dance.

What if I stop dancing?

Yeah.

Calm down.

Quiet, quiet.

Listen.

The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

The deadline has been extended
until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.

As a gesture of goodwill,

we have released
all French nationals.

And then,
once our comrades are freed,

you will all be free.

You can go back
to the big room now.

Come on.

Come on.

Israel never negotiates.

Come on, everyone.
No.

Where do you think
you are going?

This is a letter for my wife.

Hurry up.

<i>- Oui, monsieur.
Merci.</i>

Here.

I'll take care of it.

Yeah.

What is this?

Huh? It's supposed to be black.

Hey, it's the only color they had.
Yeah.

You gotta be kidding me, right?

<i>I want the best shooters
of the unit</i>

<i>inside the Mercedes with me.</i>

<i>We're gonna raid the terminal
in five teams.</i>

Joshua will lead
the first team.

Muki, second team.

Zeev, third team.

Amos and Erez,
fourth and fifth.

We're gonna land here
in the new terminal runway,

all the way to here.

We're gonna go out in one
Mercedes and two Land Rovers.

We're gonna drive all the way
to the old terminal.

We're gonna park
under the tower,

hidden from sniper fire.

Surprise and speed is the key.

<i>And if the prime minister
approves this mission,</i>

<i>we will go.</i>

<i>The terrorists only need</i>

<i>a few minutes to kill everyone.</i>

What if the first plane
is identified and attacked

before the rest of the force
has time to land and deploy?

They won't stand a chance.

And if it fails,

the blow to the IDF,
to Israel, will be...

catastrophic.

Anyway, I am bound
by the Cabinet's decision.

Yitzhak, you are the Cabinet.

Rehearse it.

They already are.

Everybody back
to first position!

I didn't see the signal.

Give me the megaphone.

You're staying first.

You go second.

You're hesitating... again.

You go last.

Motta.

I'm going to recommend
the operation

to Rabin and the Cabinet
if he says it's okay.

Can you do it, Yoni?

Is there anything

blocking their path
to the hostages?

No, sir.

There are no obstacles
around the terminal.

Nothing to stop our men
reaching the hostages.

I want the photograph to reach
the men before they leave.

Thank you.

There's nothing to stop
the operation from proceeding.

So now you have
to make a decision.

If I was still a general,

I would never approve
this mission.

It's a huge risk.

There will be casualties.
You all know that.

What we cannot doubt
is the mission.

We must complete our objective.

We need to get to the terminal
in three minutes,

kill all the terrorists
and rescue the hostages.

And we don't stop for nothing

until all the hostages
are safe.

<i>We will take off
and get into striking range</i>

<i>while we wait
for the Cabinet's decision.</i>

Let's go.

Everybody on board.

Boni.

Prime Minister.
Motta.

Prime Minister.

My position is well known
to those in this room.

I am sure that the Cabinet
will support your decision

and take collective
responsib...

Shimon, the plane's
already left.

We'll call them back
if the Cabinet decides

not to proceed
with the operation.

Motta.

Do you recommend this operation
to the Cabinet?

Yes, Prime Minister.

Gentlemen, Amos will now
read a statement,

and then we will vote.

"The government resolves
to approve

"implementation
of a rescue operation

"by the Israeli Defense Forces

"to free the hostages
at Entebbe, according to

"the plan submitted
by the defense minister

and the chief of staff."

All those in favor?

So be it.

Operation Thunderbolt
will proceed as planned.

Tel Aviv Command Center,

Thunderbolt is a go.

I repeat, Thunderbolt is a go.

ETA, Entebbe...

23:45.

Minus four hours, 32.

That's our door.

It's the fourth
from the control tower.

Juan Pablo...

I wish I was at home with you.

I wish I was at home.

I don't know where my home is.

Think we need to find a home
when this is over.

Somewhere.

Somewhere peaceful.

Jaber thinks the Israelis
will come

and they'll kill us.

And then if that happens,
we have to make a statement.

And that's why we are here.

I'm worried about Bose.

He's scared.

He is weak.
You know that.

They're all scared.

Even Jaber.

I'm not scared.

I see it.

I see everything now.

I think maybe you were right.

But if I never came here,

what would that mean?

No, there's nothing you can do.

There's nothing anyone can do.

There's no escape.

No escape.

I think maybe
I shouldn't have come.

I think maybe I shouldn't have come...
Miss.

Those phones are not working.

There are other telephones
over there.

Good-bye, Juan Pablo.

If the mission fails,
submit it.

And what's your definition
of failure, Prime Minister?

25 hostages died at Ma'alot,
and it was a disaster.

This time around,
25 or less will be a success.

<i>What's the status?</i>

<i>Last civilian flight
just took off.</i>

Should be landing
in ten minutes.

How about the radio
communication?

There's lots of static,
but they're getting through.

So... so far, so good.

Okay, gentlemen.

This is it.

Okay.

As soon as we hit the terminal,

you start shooting
the control tower.

Okay. Yeah.
Yes?

Surprise and speed is the key.

Here we go.

They are reporting gunfire.

It's too early for gunfire.

Stop.

Is that Amin?

Whatever happens...

...we did the right thing.

It's the Israelis.
Cover the door.

Cover the doors!

Go, go, go!

Get down.

Everybody, get down!

Muki, go.

Go.

David, take the door!

IDF! Everybody down!
Move forward!

Move forward! Move forward!

Everybody down!

Move forward! Move forward!
Stop! Don't shoot!

Stop!
Hostage! Hostage!

Grenade!

We are in the air.

We have 102 hostages safe
on board.

I repeat, we have 102 hostages
safe on board.

Congratulations on
your success, Prime Minister.

We saved a hundred lives.

And we should be proud of that.

But if we cannot negotiate,
Shimon,

this war will never end.
