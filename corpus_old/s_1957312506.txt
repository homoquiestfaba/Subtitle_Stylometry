(gentle music)

[Narrator] Once upon
a long, long time ago

in a country by the sea,
far, far away from here.

In a country where
our summer is winter

and our winter is summer.

In a country where
the water swirls

in the opposite direction,

and where trees grow that
nobody has ever seen before.

And where sometimes you
wonder if the sun sets

in the east or in the west.

And where everything
is different.

And where you have
to stand on your head

to see the man in the moon,

for even the man in
the moon is different.

'Cause the moon
itself is upside down.

Now, in this country
which is near the sea

and where the sun
regulates the ocean tides

instead of the moon like
it is everywhere else,

in this country
there lived a man.

The man was not
rich, he was poor.

Not really very poor, just poor.

You see, when you're
very poor it means

that you don't
have enough to eat.

But when you are
poor and just poor,

it means that you
have enough to eat,

but you eat cheaply.

When you are poor and just poor,

it means you have to work hard.

And when you work hard,
you get very hungry.

And when you are really hungry,

even the simplest food
will taste very good.

And you will eat very well
because you need the food

to give you the strength
to work again the next day.

But all of that,
you will understand

when you grow up a bit more.

(gentle music)

Let's go back to
the country where

the man in the moon
is upside down.

In this country by the sea
there was a big mountain

and the mountain was
not too far from where

the poor man lived
with his family.

And the mountain was very
big and made of stone.

There were soft
stone and hard stone,

and lots of stones
that was even harder.

The stones were many colors,

and some blue like the
ocean, some were green,

dark green, and light,
and there was red also,

and some were very dark blue.

Some of the stones, the ones
that were very, very hard,

looked like they had
fire burning inside them.

The really hard stones, of
course, were the diamonds,

but they were very small.

The red ones were called rubies.

The blue were turquoises.

There are amethysts and
garnets and there were stones

of many, many different colors.

And there was one stone
that looked like a teardrop

or a piece of melted ice.

But it had a difficult name,

and the poor man could never
remember the difficult name.

There were many others,

but there was a lot of
ordinary stone also.

And the man who
ate rather cheaply,

went to the mountain every
day of the week, but Sunday.

(bells ringing)
Because on Sunday,

he went to church with
this little family.

(singing in foreign language)

(light music)

And he cut through lots
and lots of ordinary stone

to get to the beautiful
hard, colored stones.

And that was a lot of hard work,

but the beautiful colors
of the stones made it all

worthwhile because that was
the way the man who was poor,

but not very poor, earned
money to buy the food,

so that he and his family
could eat well and cheaply.

And at night, when the
cool night wind blew

from the top of the mountain,

all the way down to
the little thatched hut

of the stonecutter
and his family,

they slept well and warm, and
they all loved each other.

And that is the way it was.

(ethereal music)

The next day, the stonecutter
did not find many stones.

The work was hard
and the sun was hot,

and now it was getting
to the middle of the day

and he had only
found four garnets.

The garnets were light red.

He liked rubies better.

It was always a good day
when he found rubies.

Rubies were deep, dark
red and full of mystery.

And he could also sell
them for much more,

but they were much
more difficult to find,

and he did not find them often.

He was hot and tired from
working the mountain,

so he went to the
nearby waterfall

to wash the dust
off his shoulders.

He liked to sound with the
clear cascading waters.

The falling waters brushed
the dust off his back

and he felt nice and clean.

The waters of the fall
cooled him off also,

and he felt a lot less tired.

It was good to
have the waterfall

so close to his work
on the mountain,

because sometimes when he
wanted to work on some stones,

he would carry the stones
to the mountain pool

and do his work in the
shade near to fall,

because then he could
listen to the birds also.

The birds were always there,
(birds chirping)

from early in the morning
and all throughout the day.

And the birds drank from
the pool near the fall,

and the falling water
sang with the birds,

and the birds sang
with the falling water.

And all of it, the
falling of the cool water

and the singing of the birds
in the trees near the pool,

made it a good place to
come and rest for a while.

At times, he wondered if
at night the bird slept

in the trees near the waterfall

or into trees lower
down the mountain

where they could not hear
the singing of the water.

Or perhaps the water sang
very, very softly at night,

so it would not disturb the
birds sleeping in the trees.

After a while, he
climbed a big rock.

Close to where he had done
the work for the morning.

There was a soft
wind blowing now.

So he spread out his arms
and let the sun and the wind

then dry him off.

It felt good to stand
there on the big rock,

high above the village and
the valley and the sea.

The sun had dried him off now,

so he said down to eat his food.

(gentle music)

And then, he thought
about going fishing

with old Thomas near
the pass of the reef.

In hearing the sound of
the waves on the reef

in the seascape of his mind,

made him close his
eyes for a moment.

And as he did so, he
entered the world of dreams.

(light playful music)

And he flew with the birds over
the waves of the big ocean,

and flying with the
birds he saw dolphins,

playfully jumping near
the path for the lagoon

in the seascape of his mind.

(gentle music)

And he reminded
himself in his dream

to tell old Thomas about
flying with the birds.

It could be a sign perhaps.

And surely, old
Thomas would know.

Because he had been
living on the beach

as long as anyone
could remember.

And old Thomas knew all about
the winds and the tides.

The stonecutter knew
all about the stones

in the mountain and
where to find them.

But old Thomas new
everything about the sea.

(conc shell whistling)

The sound of the conc
shell woke him up.

The sun was a little higher
in the sky now and he had

remembered that he had
promised his wife and children

that he would meet them in the
village to watch the dancers.

So, he started walking down
the mountain and he heard

the singing of the dancers
from down below in the village.

And all of a sudden, he did
not feel tired at all anymore.

(singing in foreign language)

He thought it would be
nice to buy some flowers

for his wife at
Ella's fruit stand.

And he bought the flowers
from her granddaughter.

And he paid for the flowers
with one of the garnets.

(singing in foreign language)

And now, he had only three left,

but that was all
right because he knew

that his wife would be
happy with the flowers.

And he walked a little faster.

He did not look back to wave
at Ella and her granddaughter,

so he never saw
the beautiful child

with the white dress
in the distance.

She was wearing a
crown of flowers,

and she was lovely to look at.

She did not wear any shoes.

And her eyes were
very, very beautiful.

If the stonecutter
would have seen her,

he would have noticed her eyes;

lovingly, dreamily beautiful
like a secret found

in a garden of a dream
in the early summer.

But the stonecutter did
not see any of that.

After he had taken
his flowers home,

he arrived in the village.

The dancers had already started.

His wife and children were there

and so was Ella and
her granddaughter.

(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)

(gentle music)

The smell of roasting coffee
woke him up the next morning.

Old Thomas had given him
some fish the night before,

so he walked out onto the beach

and started feeding the birds.

(gentle music continues)

Thomas had told him that
the sign of flying with

the birds in his dream on
the mountain was a good sign.

The stonecutter
walked along the cool,

shady road in the forest.

He had passed Hiro's
house and he had asked him

if he could make a
tattoo on his arm.

And Hiro had told him
that he would come

to the stonecutter's house
a bit later in the day.

The stonecutter gathered greens
for the rabbits of his son.

And now, he sat
near the stone slab

in the quietness of the glade.

And from far away, he heard
the singing of children.

And he thought how
early they had started.

With the smell of
the roasting coffee

and the birds and
the sun also rising.

And he knew that his day on the
mountain would be good also.

The day had started well with
the feeding of the birds,

and the waves rolling
in gently over the reef.

And when a day starts well,

he knew that it would
keep on going well.

One good thing after another.

But it also would be nice
if there could be a sign.

Like flying with the
birds in his dream

on the mountain the day before.

And from away in the distance
(school bell chiming)

he heard the school bell chime.

But he did not know
if that was his sign.

And he hit the stone
slab with his chisel.

(chisel clinking)

And the school
bell chimed again.

(school bell chiming)

And as he hit the
stone slab again,

the school bell chimed
in perfect harmony

with the sounds of the stone.

And he knew that was his sign.

And he also knew
that all was well.

(soft relaxing music)

When the stonecutter came
home later that afternoon,

the children were weaving
baskets and hats with Ella.

And his wife had been roasting
breadfruit on an open fire.

But his day on the mountain
had been very good.

Better than usual.

And all in all, with the
birds early in the morning

and the gentle waves and
the sound in the stone,

it had been a very good
day on the mountain.

He was sitting at a
table when Hiro arrived.

(soft relaxing music)

The stonecutter wanted
a round tattoo and Hiro

told him that when completed,

the tattoo would illustrate
the path of his life.

No matter where you started,

it would always be
at the beginning.

Then he would move on,
the beginning would become

the end of the beginning.

And also, the
beginning of the end.

Once you begin your
journey somewhere,

you will in the course
of your progress,

forget where you began.

And if you did that,
you would not know where

the circle of your
life would end.

And he thought about all of that

as his wife massaged his back.

And at times, he would
look out into the faraway

distance where the sun
painted brilliant colors

on the waters of the lagoon.

And one night, he stood
on the beach and looked

at the three quarter full moon,

and the silver reflections
on the calm lagoon.

(soft relaxing music)

And standing on the beach,
thinking about the fish,

and thinking about his family
asleep in his little house,

all this made him wonder
about the purpose of his life.

And he looked up at the
moon hanging in the dark sky

of the night, and he wondered
what it would be like

to fly beyond the moon
and out to the stars.

And time started to slow down.

(gentle music)

The winds had been blowing
steadily from the northeast for

the last four days now, and
the lagoon was nice and calm.

(gentle music)

Every morning, he
had walked over

to ask old Thomas
about the fishing.

And every morning, the
reply had been the same.

"Not today, perhaps tomorrow."

For three days, the stonecutter
had watched the waves on

the reef while feeding his
manta rays in the early morning.

And for three days, there
hardly had been any clouds

in the sky at all.

Finally, the day arrived.

The stonecutter had not
been flying with birds

in any of his dreams,

but if old Thomas said
that today was the day,

then that was all right
because he had been fishing

the lagoon for longer than
anyone could remember.

Thomas and the stonecutter
prepared their fishing lines.

They took a small board
for cutting the bait

that the old man had
caught the night before.

And the children took the palm
leaf covers off the canoe.

And they rowed the canoe
with slow, steady strokes

to where they would do their
fishing for the afternoon

and part of the night.

(gentle music)

The steady rolling of the
waves on the coral reef

was good to listen to.

And they saw a solitary
white bird flying home

to the dark green hills
in the faraway distance.

There was always solitude
that went with the fishing.

And sometimes the stonecutter
thought that he liked

the solitude of fishing better
than the fishing itself.

There was solitude in the
mountain too, of course,

but he never did have to do
any waiting on the mountain.

There was always
something to do.

(gentle music)

There was more time for
thinking when fishing.

Most of the things you thought
about would not make much

sense anymore in the early
morning when the smell of

roasting coffee would start
to drift out over the lagoon,

because then we'd only
think about coming home

to your wife and children.

Letting your thoughts
drift along slowly

was all part of fishing,
like the waves on the reef

and the solitary
bird flying away,

and the gold around the
white clouds when the sun

would get lower and lower
in the sky of the west.

They never talked much, old
Thomas and the stonecutter.

And when they did talk,
it was about fishing.

Sometimes he wondered if
old Thomas would think about

different things than
fishing, but he never asked.

The old man did not ask either.

So there was the waiting.

Waiting for the fish and the
first little tugs on the line,

and then the fish taking
the bait, pulling strongly.

And then the fish trying
to get off the hook,

and swimming and
darting any which way

to try and shake off the hook.

And then everything
would start to speed up,

and time would go very
fast until the fish

was safely in the canoe.

And then you could let
time slow down again.

(gentle music)

And with the slowing
down of time,

the waiting would start again.

And with the waiting, the
thinking would start again also;

thinking about having
breakfast in the early morning

of the next day made him
smile ever so softly.

And he looked at
the old man to see

if he had noticed him smiling.

But old Thomas was
fishing and seemed

to be thinking
thoughts of his own.

There were no more
birds at sea now,

and the lagoon kept
changing colors

with the reflections of the sun.

And they knew that the fishing
would be good at night also.

(light calming music)

One early morning when he
went to work on the mountain,

he saw a child.

And she was all dressed in white

with a crown of
flowers on her head.

She was very beautiful
and she had long hair,

and she did not wear any shoes.

He waved at the child and
she waved back at him,

and that made him
feel very good.

During the day as
he did his work,

he often thought of the child.

When the sun rose high in
the sky and became too hot

on his back, he sat down
under a tree to eat the food

that his wife had
prepared for him.

And he thought of
the child again.

He thought that it would be
nice if he would see her again

on the way back home.

Perhaps she would wave at
him again from a distance.

At the end of the day when
the sun went down in the sky,

he finished his work
and he was tired.

He walked down the
mountain road back

to his house in the woods.

But he did not see the child.

He did not tell his wife
or his children about

the child with the white dress
and no shoes on her feet.

And that night they all
slept well and warm,

and they were happy
and contented.

The child was not there
the next morning either,

nor the next.

And the sun was hot
and the work was hard,

and at the end of
the day he was tired,

but the stonecutter did
not mind because his wife

had told him that there
would soon be another

little baby in the family.

And that made the
stonecutter very happy,

even though he would have to
work harder to earn more money

to buy the food for
the new baby child.

And then, when he had almost
forgotten about the child

in the white dress with
the flowers on her head

and no shoes on her feet,

he saw her again
early one morning.

And she waved at him as
if she recognized him,

and he waved back at her and
he felt happy all day long.

Perhaps because of the
child with no shoes

or perhaps because of the new
baby that was going to come

or perhaps because of both.

He was not quite sure.

He did not really expect to
see her after he had stopped

work the next day when
the sun was down low

in the sky again, but she was
there on the side of the road,

a little closer this time.

The last rays of the
sun lit up her dress

with soft yellow gold.

And she was very beautiful.

And she waved again.

She was close enough so
that the poor stonecutter

could see that
she smiled at him.

And he waved to
her and walked back

to his little thatched
house under the trees.

And that night, he did
not feel tired at all.

Not even one little bit.

(soft calming music)

His encounters with the child
became closer and closer,

and she was there again the
next morning, and the next.

And her flowers never faded
and she waved and she smiled

as before, and it all made the
stonecutter feel very good.

And each time, she
got a little closer.

And each time, she smiled.

And then, one afternoon just
as the sun poured bright

yellow gold all over her
dress again, she spoke to him.

And the stonecutter
noticed her eyes,

and her eyes were light green.

Light gray green like
the waters of the lagoon

just before you get
to the coral reef.

Light green like the
lightest of the green stones

in the mountain.

And the light green windows
of her soul smiled at him.

(birds chirping)

She told the stonecutter that
she would give him something

to make him feel good and to
make his work a lot easier,

and she smiled as
she spoke to him.

And she gave him seven
beautiful music sounds.

(gentle humming)

She told him that if he would
whistle them or sing them

or even hum them, then the
sun would not be so hot

and he would be less tired

and he would feel
good all day long.

And then, she disappeared
all of a sudden.

But the perfume of her
flower crown lingered on.

The stonecutter tried the
sounds and the sounds went from

low to high like climbing
up the steps of a ladder.

He whistled them
also and sometimes he
sort of hummed them.

But he liked singing
or whistling the best.

While climbing up the
mountain to get stone,

he would start a game with
the sounds on the mountain.

He would wait until
he was halfway up,

and then he would tell himself,

"Now I will start
the music sounds.

And when I will have
whistled all seven of them,

I will stop at the last sound."

And it worked.

He always found more
beautiful stones

at the place where
the last sound ended.

More than he had ever found
in any place on the mountain.

The music sounds are the
special magic all of their own.

(gentle humming)

Then, one day, he lost
one of the sounds.

(eerie chiming)

It just disappeared and no
matter how hard he tried

to remember it, it did not
come back into his head.

He tried everything;
humming, whistling, singing.

And every time he counted
them, but he had only six left.

He had lost it and
he was a little sad.

(light music)

And he wished that the
child with the white dress

would be on the side
of the road again.

And perhaps she would help
him find the missing sound,

but the child was not
there that afternoon.

And he never did find
the missing sound.

Now he had only six
music sounds left

and it bothered him not
to have all seven anymore.

And he cut stone as before,
and the work was hard,

and he was disappointed
about the sound he had lost.

And then, he lost another
one of the magic sounds.

He tried to remember what
it sounded like so that

he could bring it back into
his head, but it had gone,

disappeared just
like the first one.

And he thought, pretty
soon I will lose them all,

and then I won't have
any music sounds left.

And the more he thought about
it, the more he worried.

And the more worried, the
more frightened he became.

Afraid that he would lose
the next magic sound.

And because he worried
about losing the next sound,

he counted how many he had left,

just in case he might
have lost another one

of his magic sounds.

(light music)

And then, he lost it.

(eerie chiming)

Early in the morning on the
way to the big mountain,

it disappeared and
he knew it was gone.

And he knew it
would not come back.

And when he climbed up the
mountain, he worried a lot.

And he did not use his remaining
sounds at all that day.

And when his work was finished,
he walked down the mountain,

and he did not even notice
the beautiful sunset,

and the child with
the flower crown

and the white dress
was not there either.

He looks in the grass to
see if she had been there,

but no grass had been
touched by any bare feet,

and there was nothing
to tell him that perhaps

she had been waiting for him.

And there was no smell of
flowers in the air either.

So, he went home to his
little house in the woods,

and he was not happy at all.

Before he went to
bed that night,

he hummed the four
remaining sounds

to see if he had
still four left.

And he forgot all about
saying his bedtime prayer

for his wife and
his little children.

And he did not sleep very
well at all that night.

And in the middle night, he
had a bad dream about losing

yet another one of
the beautiful sounds.

And he woke up and went outside

his little house and
repeated the sounds.

(soft music)
(bugs chirping)

And sure enough, he
had lost another one.

(eerie chiming)

Now, he had only three left.

(singing in foreign language)

And the next day, he did not
play the music sound game

when he went cutting
stone on the mountain.

He did not find
many stones either,

and at the end of the
day he was tired and sad.

Even thinking about a new baby

did not help very much either.

The thoughts about the
arrival of the new baby

did not make him happy
and strong like before.

Because the sounds were missing
and he was afraid to use

the remaining three sounds
for fear he might lose them.

And as he walked down the
mountain at the end of the day,

he did not notice the
bird singing in trees.

(birds chirping)

Nor did he notice
the beautiful sunset.

He felt sad and tired and
he looked down at his feet

as he walked down
the mountain road,

back to his little
house under the trees.

(singing in foreign language)

And then, he saw her.

(gentle music)

The child with the white
dress and the flowers,

the child with no
shoes tending to grass

on the side of the
road, just like that.

And her feet were bare and when
he looked at her feet again,

he saw that she was not
standing on the grass at all.

Her feet with no shoes
were just above the ground.

As a matter of fact, they did
not even touch the ground.

And then he understood
why he had not been able

to see her if she had
been there before.

And he also understood why
her feet never left marks

in the grass on the
side of the road.

And he told her about losing
the sounds one by one,

and how it made him sad.

And he told her how afraid
he was about losing them all,

because what is the use
if you receive something

that makes you happy, only
to feel sad when you lose it.

It is better not to
receive anything at all

because it will make you
very happy for a while,

and then when you don't have
it anymore, sadness comes.

And perhaps, it is best no
to be very happy or very sad.

It is a lot better perhaps,

if you were like everybody else.

Not too happy and not too sad.

And the child with the flower
crown looked at the poor

stonecutter with her
gray-green soul window eyes

and then she smiled.

And as she smiled,
the sun did it again.

The sun poured
liquid gold all over

her dress again, like before.

And some of the gold got
all over her face too.

She laid her hands
on the shoulders of
the tired stonecutter

and her hands were as
light as butterfly wings.

She looked deep into
his eyes with her green

soul window eyes and she said,
"I was supposed to give you

three magic sounds
only and no more.

But I game you seven so
that you could lose a few,

and still have three left.

And you have lost exactly the
sounds that you don't need.

And the three remaining
sounds will be yours

from now on, forevermore.

And now, I must teach you
how to use them correctly

and in the right order.

And when you use 'em
exactly as I will teach you,

then you will never be said
anymore as long as you live.

And all the time as she spoke,
her gray-green soul window

eyes looked way
deep inside of him.

And the girl with
the white dress,

she told him the secret
of how to use the sounds.

And they stood there for a long
time in the golden light of

the sun and little stars started
to dance all around them.

(gentle music)

And the child with
no shoes on her feet,

told the stonecutter
how to use the sounds.

And she warned him to use
'em in the correct order only

or the magic of the
sound would not work.

The way to see if the
magic of the three sounds

was still there would be
to look up into the sky,

but only if the sky was blue.

And then he had to pick
two clouds and look between

the two clouds into
the blue of the sky

where the secret was.

The secret or the
magic of the sounds.

And he asked about the
golden dancing star also,

but she just smiled and
told him she would tell him

perhaps later, but not now.

And the stonecutter
understand everything.

And he thought he
was lucky to have met

the beautiful child
with no shoes.

And her looking inside
his soul through his eyes

made him happy and
he loved the child

with the green eyes very much.

Not at all in the same
way that he loved his wife

and his children and the
little house under the trees,

but differently.

He could not quite
explain why or how,

but it all made him feel
happy and contented.

And then, just as the sun went
to sleep behind a horizon,

the child with the white dress
disappeared, just like that.

He did not even see her go.

And the perfume of her
flower crown lingered on.

And he looked in the
grass and he remembered

that her feet never
touched the grass.

And he hummed his
three magic sounds

and they were all there.

And he walked down
the road to his

little thatched
house in the woods.

(gentle music)

The stonecutter
went to the mountain

very early the next day.

He had hummed his
three magic sounds

a few times and
they were all there.

He would be working in a
different place on the mountain,

so he took the forest road.

And now, he wanted to rest a bit

before climbing the mountain.

He was happy with the three
sounds the child had given him.

But he was also a little
afraid that he might lose them,

like he had lost four of
the seven sounds before.

And from far away, he
heard the school bell

ringing three times.
(school bell ringing)

And then he heard the singing
of the children join in.

And they sang the three
sounds that the child

had told him would
be his forever more.

And he hit the stone
slab three times.

The sounds were the same.

They had been inside the stone
for a million years perhaps.

And if they had been
there for that long,

they would always be there.

And he knew that now he
would never lose them.

Never, ever as long as he lived.

(waterfall splashing)

(gentle music)

And day-in, day-out, the
stonecutter went to the mountain

to cut stone and he
never saw the child

with the white dress again.

And he played the magic
sound game at the mountain

and the stones, and sometimes
he would find very small

stones that looked like
the eyes of the child.

And then he thought of
her and her flower crown

and her feet with no shoes.

And the new baby came.

And he wished he could show
the new baby to the child,

and he was happy
with the new baby

and he worked a little harder.

And he grew a little older,

but he did not mind the
hard work and the small pay.

And as he grew older still,

he realized that he now had
less time left in his life.

But he did not mind
that too much either.

But it seemed that the mountain

did not ever grow any smaller,

no matter how much and how
long he would cut stone.

Sometimes he would make a
mistake with the music sounds

and the sun would be
hot on his back again.

And at the end of the day he
would be tired like before.

And then, one day, he
whistled the magic sounds,

but they did not come out right.

They were not in
the correct order

that the child had told him.

And he could not get them
to go right all day long.

And he became tired again
and the sun was very hot too.

The next day, the sun was even
hotter, especially at noon.

The stonecutter was tired
and unhappy and he looked up

at the sun and he wished
that he could become the sun,

'cause then he could
shine on everything

and nobody would be
stronger than him.

He would shine on the
fields and the trees,

and he would shine
on the people,

and he would shine
on the mountain,

and he would shine all day long.

And he would be so hot in
the middle of the day when

he would be high in the sky,
that people would have to go

and sit under a
shady tree just to be

sheltered from his rays.

And he became the sun.

(gentle music)

(upbeat music)
(birds chirping)

And he was happy again.

And everyday, he had to
go to work like before,

but now he, himself,
was the sun.

And the stonecutter
who had become the sun,

had to do all sorts of
things that were different

from what he was used to.

He had to rise
early in the morning

and he had to color the
entire surface of the sea.

And then, he had to color the
tops of the highest trees,

and work his way down with
the colors all the way

to the little drops
of dew in the grass

that grew at the foot
of the big mountain.

Then he had to wake
up the roosters.

(rooster crowing)
And the roosters

would wake up the chickens.

And then he had to
wake up the birds

that slept in the trees.

And then he had to turn
the flowers with his rays,

and that was a lot of work
too because he had to keep

on doing that all day
long with some of them,

right till he went to
sleep behind the horizon.

And to keep the flowers happy
and contented so that they

would make nice
perfumes all day long

was a great responsibility.

But the stonecutter
who had become the sun,

did all his new work happily
and with great pleasure.

But what he loved most was
shining his rays on the mountain

at the end of the day 'cause
then he could light up all

the color of the
beautiful stones

on the face of the mountain.

And as he did so, he hummed
his three magic sounds

very, very softly.

And the sounds were in
the right order again.

And with the music magic,
the colors became even more

beautiful when he touched
them with his rays.

There were the beautiful
reds of the rubies,

the sky blue colors
of the turquoises,

and the diamonds were of a
beautiful sparkling white

like the dress of the child.

Then there was the deep dark
blue which was the same color

of the ocean when it gets angry.

And the pink of
the golden clouds

when the setting
sun shines on them.

There was also the green of
the emeralds which were like

the eyes of the child that have
given him the magic sounds.

And at night, he would go
to sleep just below the line

that is between the
sea and the sky.

And he slept well and
content and happily dreaming

about doing his work
even better the next day.

And he thought he was
very lucky to be the sun,

and to have all the sounds
back in the right order,

just like the
child had told him.

He was happy to be the sun and
not the stonecutter anymore.

(singing in foreign language)
The stonecutter had not

come home for three days now.

And for three days,
old Thomas had come

to feed the birds
early in the morning.

Sometimes he brought some fruit

for the stonecutter's family.

And once or twice he'd
give 'em some fish

he'd caught the night before.

They had not seen
the stonecutter.

Every morning, the
children went to school,

but they had not
seen their father.

And at meal time, his place
had stayed and stayed empty.

So, in the afternoon
of the fourth day,

they went looking for him.

They walked down the road
until they got to the glade,

but the stonecutter
was not there.

And there was nothing to
show them that perhaps

he had been there on
any of the days before.

And near the place where
he usually did his work,

they found his tools.

His bag was still there,

but none of the food
had been touched.

(singing in foreign language)

And near the waterfall,

his son found some drinking
nuts and his knife.

But the stonecutter
was not there either.

(singing in foreign language)

And the sky turned gold
with the setting of the sun,

but they did not notice
the beautiful sunset

because they were
sad and disappointed.

(waves crashing)
(singing in foreign language)

And then, one day, there
appeared a little cloud

on the horizon.

The cloud started to grow and
it became bigger and bigger.

And the bigger it grew,
the darker the sky became.

The sun tried to
melt the cloud away,

but it just became
bigger and bigger.

The cloud started to make rain.

First of all, a little bit
of rain so that the sun

could make a nice
rainbow with it,

but then the cloud started
to make real big rains

and the entire sky became dark.

And now, the cloud
covered the entire sky.

And then, the cloud started
to make really big rains,

bigger than anybody
had ever seen before.

When the rains became
bigger and bigger,

the rivers became big
with the rain also.

Soon the rivers turned
angry with all the rain,

and the winds got angry too.

It started to rain even harder,

and the sun could
not do anything about
it because the cloud

had become so big that the sun
could not get through at all.

And after it had rained
many days and many nights,

the sun said, "I'm
tired of all this rain.

The cloud with all the
rain is stronger than I am.

I wish I was the cloud."

And he became the cloud.
(rain pattering)

(singing in foreign language)

And he slowly drifted
along in the sky,

and the sky became blue again.

And when the sky was blue,

the cloud let the sun
shine in the blue sky.

The cloud knew he was very
strong and he happily chanted

the three magic music sounds.

The cloud knew it was
stronger than the sun

because it just knew
that it could turn black

and angry anytime he wanted to.

Everything went back to normal.

(singing in foreign language)

(light music)

And then, one fine
day, the cloud thought,

"Why don't I see if I'm
really stronger than the sun

and the mountain
and everybody else.

I will just start to rain a
bit more and see how black

and important I can become."

He liked the idea very much and
he became very big and black

and then he drifted
in front of the sun.

And the sun got scared and
tried into that part of the sky

that was still clear.

That made the cloud so mad,
and he told the angry winds

to blow and the
angry winds blew over

the waves of the great ocean,

and it became a personal
battle between the cloud

and the sun to see who
was the most powerful.

And that made the cloud
even more mad and he said,

"Now, I will really get dark
and nasty and I will make

big rains bigger than anybody
has ever seen before."

And that is exactly what he did.

(water rushing)

And he rained so much that
all the flowers drowned

with the rain and the rivers
got angry with the rains.

And the sun ran away
because he got scared,

and the cloud rained
on everything.

And the cloud rained very
hard on the mountain, too.

But the mountain did not move.

And that made the
cloud even madder

and the cloud started to
rain on the mountain so hard

that the mountain
started to cry.

But the mountain did not move.

It just stood there and cried.

And when the mountain cried,
it made beautiful waterfalls

and the waterfalls washed all
the stones nice and clean.

The colored stones did
not shine as beautiful

as when the sun would shine
on them at sunset time,

but the waterfalls were so
beautiful that many people came

and looked at them and
they tried to count them,

but there was so many that
people lost count all the time.

And everybody said
that the mountain

had made waterfalls
of great beauty.

And that made the
cloud very jealous.

And he said, "The mountain
is stronger than I am.

I want to become the mountain."

And he became the mountain.

(birds chirping)
(rain pattering)

(singing in foreign language)

(light flute music)

And then, early one morning,
after the sun had started to

paint the tops of the trees and
before the roosters woke up,

a man walked from his little
thatched hut in the woods.

He had kissed his wife
and his children who were

still asleep in the little
house under the trees.

Asleep warm, happy,
and contented.

And he took the basket
with the food that his wife

had prepared for him
the night before.

And the man went to the mountain
and started to get stones.

(chisel clanking)

(light music)

The mountain woke up, of course,
and he saw the stonecutter.

But the mountain did
not care one bit.

He thought, "I will let
him cut stone from me

for a little while.

I am so big that nobody will
know the difference anyway.

But I don't mind."

The mountain thought that
the stonecutter would soon

get tired and would
have to stop at midday

would the sun would become
too hot and burn his back.

Then the middle of the day
came and the stonecutter went

and sat under the shade
of a tree and ate the food

that his wife had
prepared for him.

(gentle music)

Then, the stonecutter rested a
while and when he was rested,

he went back to work
and cut more stone

until well after sunset.

And the stonecutter
came back the next day

and the next and the next,

and he kept on cutting
stone day-in and day-out.

And the mountain did not
think that was very funny.

The stonecutter kept on
coming back day after day,

and that started to make
the mountain a little mad.

And when the mountain got mad,

he tried to make the magic
sounds, but they came out wrong

because they always come
out wrong when you're mad.

And the mountain told the
sun to shine a little harder,

so that the stonecutter
would get hot and tired

and would stop cutting stone.

But the stonecutter kept on
cutting stone just like before.

He did not mind the sun and
the sun could not stop him.

And that made the
mountain even more mad.

And the mountain tried to make
the magic music sounds again,

but he got them all
backwards this time.

They just did not
come out right at all.

The mountain was very strong,

but nobody really
loved the mountain.

Sure, everybody admired
the mountain very much,

but nobody really loved the
mountain like the family

of the stonecutter
loved the stonecutter.

And finally, the big
mountain had to admit,

the stonecutter is
stronger than I am.

And the mountain wished
he was a stonecutter.

And he became the stonecutter.

(gentle music)

(soft relaxing music)

The stonecutter had asked
Hiro to come to the mountain

and finish the
tattoo on his arm.

And when Hiro found
him near the waterfall,

he was sound asleep.

So, he laid out his tools
and he waited a while.

Then, he started to
work on the tattoo.

The gentle tapping
woke up the stonecutter

and he told Hiro
about his dream.

In his dream, he had
been the mountain.

He was very strong and
very, very powerful.

But he had found out that
when you have that much power,

nobody loves you anymore.

Sure, everybody or almost
everybody admires you very much

because of all the
power you have,

but nobody really loves you.

And when nobody loves
you, you get very lonely.

Sure, you are too strong to
admit that you are very lonely

and you pretend
it doesn't matter.

But being lonely
is no fun at all.

Now the tattoo was finished.

And as they walked back home,

Hiro told him that the circle
of his life was now completed.

And the stonecutter remembered
how lonely he had been

when he was the
mountain in his dream.

And then he thought of
his wife and children,

and those birds on the beach,

and the fishing with old Thomas.

And he thought, it
is better to have

love than power anytime.

And as they walked
down the mountain,

the sound of the singing
got closer and closer.

The stonecutter
was happy not to be

the big lonely mountain anymore.

And all of a sudden, he
noticed that the grass

seemed greener, much,
much greener than before.

(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)

And he thought, this
moment, this very moment,

right now and here,
is going to be

the beginning of my new life.

(singing in foreign language)

And then he thought
about his wife

and children and the new baby.

He said to himself, "I will
bring them all to the glade

and I will show them
where the sounds are.

And when they will
hear the sounds,

I can tell them about the
girl with the white dress

and the flowers on her head."

And you could tell from
the joy in his heart,

that his new life had begun.

(singing in foreign language)

(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

(pickax clinking)

Then the stonecutter cut
stone on the big mountain.

And the work was hard
and the pay was low,

and sometimes he would be
very tired as he grew older.

And the sun was hot
and burned his back,

but he came back to cut stone
day after day after day.

And after a long, long
day of cutting stone,

he would go back to the little
thatched hut in the woods

where he lived with his family.

And they ate well and
cheaply, and they slept well

and contented in their
little house in the woods.

And they all loved each other.

(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

Well, hear your story.

The story of the stonecutter
who thought he was poor,

but who was not really
very poor at all.

And had to learn not
to be discontented.

And if sometimes you
feel sad or unhappy,

then you can listen to the story

because you know that
the lesson is true.

And perhaps one day, you'll
meet a child with no shoes

and the flower crown
and the white dress

with the gold
poured all over it.

And perhaps she
will smile at you

with her green soul window eyes.

And perhaps she will
tell you the secret of

the three magic sounds and the
little golden dancing star.

But I cannot promise you that.

And in this world,
neither can anyone else.
