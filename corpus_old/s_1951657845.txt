Hello Nicholas.
Hello Sergeant.


How's the hand?
Still a bit stiff.

It can get awfully scary out there.
I am surprised that you hadn't stepped up sooner 

for a nice desk job, that's what i do.
I prefer that my office is out in the street.

Indeed you do. Your  arrest record is 
400% higher than any other officer.
 

Which is why it's high time that such
skills were put to better use.

We are making you Sergeant.
I see.

In Sandford, Gloucesterchire.
In where,sorry?

In Sandford, Gloucesterchire.
That is in the country.

Yes,perfect.

Isn't there a sergeant's 
position, here in London?


No.
Can I remain here as a PC?

No.
Do I have any choice in this?

No.

Sergeant, I kind of like it here.
Well you've always wanted to transfer to the country.

In 20 years or so ,yes..
Well I knew.

I don't remember telling you that.
Yes you did, you said:

I'd like to settle down in
the country sometime Janine.

I'd like to talk to the Inspector.
You can speak to the inspector, but

I can promise you he will tell you
exactly the same thing as I have.

Hello Nicholas. How's the hand?
It's still a bit stiff.

And how are things at home?
I am sorry sir?

How's Janine?

We are no longer together Sir

Well,then where are you living?
He is  staying in the section house Sir.

With the recruits?
Yes, he is living out of cardboardboxes.

Well then you are packed already.

Nicholas we are offering a smashing 
position, with a delightful cottage and a...

lovely little place that I think has
won village of the year I don't know how many times.

It'll be good for you.

I don't really know what to say.
Yes?

Yes,thank you.

No, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to..
You wanna take this higher?

Yes, yes I do.

You want me to bother the 
Chief Inspector for this?

Yes.

You want me to get the Chief Inspector 
to come all the way down here?

Yes I do.
-Well ok.

Keneth.
Hello Nicholas. How's the hand?

Still a bit stiff.
Cief Inspector 

Please sit.

Now, I know what you're going to say,
but the fact is you've been making us  

all look bad.
I am sorry Sir?

Of course we all appreciate  your
efforts,but you've been wrong letting sides down.

It's all about being a team player,Nicholas.
You can't be the Sheriff of London.

If we let you carry on running around in
town,you'll continue to be exceptional.

And we can't have that.You'll
put us all out of our job.

With respect Sir,you can't just
make people disappear.

Yes I can. I am the Chief Inspector.

well, how ever you spin this,there's 
one thing you haven't taken into account.

And that what the team is 
gonna make of this.

Hello!
Jenine, It's me.

I know. I am at work.
-I know. I am outside.

What's the situation?
You know the situation.We've been over this.

No, I mean here.
Two people involved, the scene

might have been a struggle, a complete mess.
Do you want to talk to me out here?

Nicholas,what do you want?
Well, I have something important to tell you,

and I didn't want to do it over the phone.

Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

I am not Jenine.

Janine,I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

I know, Bob told me.

Well, I wanted to tell you in person.

There is no reason we can't    each other.
It's not that long ago we were 
talking about getting married.

yes, but you were already
married with the Force,weren't you?

we are actually supposed 
to call it the service now,



official vocab guideline stated
that force is too agressive.


See? I's only ever about the job,
it's all you care about.

That's not true.

No, you're right.Do 
have that  plant.

It is Japanese Peace Lilly.
You just can't switch off Nicholas.

And until you find a person you
care abut more than your job, 
you never will.

besides, you were the one that
suggested we take a break. 

Yes, well

guilty people are 
for make the first move.
  

Actually,there is something I need to tell you.
You are seeing someone else.

Yeah. How did you...?
Is it Bob?

No. Does Bob look like
the kind of person I go out with? 


It's Dave.Hello there! 

I see.
 
Oh Nicholas.

You do realize that window
is broken from the inside.

Hello there Nicholas. Frank Butterman
here. Your new Inspector.

I just call with details
of your accommodation.

You've got your lovely little 
cottage on Spencerhill.Look 
forward to meeting you along.Cheerio.

Nicholas, Frank again.
One other thing about your cottage,

it's not ready.

It would appear the heavens have opened.

I was hoping to check in.

Check in? But you've
always been here.

Excuse me?

Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were my
husband.You must be Sergeant Angel.

Yes, I am.

I am Joyce Cooper. I trust you
had a pleasant trip. Fascist.

I beg your pardon?
System of Government characterized by

extreme dictatorship. 7 across.
Oh, I see. I's fascism.

Fascism, wonderful.

We'll put you in the Castle
suite. Bernie will escort you up there.

Actually, I could probably make my own way up.

Hag.
i beg your pardon? 

Evil old woman considered
frigthfull or ugly.it's 12 down.

Oh bless you.

"Castle Suite "

A lager please, Mary.

Yes Sir,what can I get you?

-Police Officer.Yes.I am Nicholas Angel.

I am Roy Potter, this is my wife,Mary.
-Welcome to Sanford.

You are 37?
Yeah.

When's your birthday?

Out.

Is there a problem officer? 
Yes there is  Mr. Potter.

It would appear a number of your 
patrons are underage.

Well, they could be a month or two younger,
but if they're in here, it stops them

from getting into trouble out there . 
It is this way we see it.
It's all for the greater good.

The greater good.
well,if that'S as may be 

but the law is the law
and they will have to go.

Another cranberry juice?
I'm fine, thank you.

"Fountain restoration completed

I hope you're not planning 
on driving that. 

No.

Right, I'm taking you
to the station.

Where is it?

Khm.
what?

Nicholas Angel.

When did you start?
Tomorrow.

Oh,I see you've already arrested the whole village.
Not exactly.

You're in for the night?

Go Ahead, 4th street???.
I need to speak to him.

ayy,he will be here for you 
to see in the morning.

Do you really want to process 
all this lot?

My pen's running low.
Not a problem.

Good morning Sergeant.
Good morning.

Good morning Sergeant.
Good morning.

Good morning Sergeant.

I am a slasher.I must be stopped.
You're a what?

A slasher of persons.

Just kidding.

local supermarket. Do drop in
and see me  sometime.

My discounts are criminal.

Morning Sergeant.

Morning Sergeant.

Could you tell the inspector
i've arrived,please?

No.

Why?

He's not in here.

Well,how's our guest?
Guest?

In cell 4.
-I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.

Can i get a cellphone please?
Not any.

He's gone.

Oh my god. Who's gone?

Why are you dressed like a 
police officer?

Because I am one.

Ah,Sergeant Angel.At last. Frank Butterman.

I see you already met my boy.
yes.

Do forgive me I am something 
of a wild-west nut.


Speaking of which,there were 
a few outlaws you rounded up last night 

Thank you Sir.

I admire your enthusiasm, far be it from
me to stamp on  your flare,
but this isn't London. Oh yes please.

With respect sir,geographical location
shouldn't factor in the application of the law.

No thank's.

statistically Sandford is the
safest village in the country.

But that doesn't mean that it requires anything
less than a careful and considerate approach.

There is a reason we accomodate a
few of the younglings in the pub.

The greater good.
The greater good,precisely.

Your predecessor assumed that rural
policing was easy.

ended up having a nervous break-down.And 
Sergeant Popwell was an exceptional officer.
truly exepctional.

And he had one thing yopou haven't got.
What's that Sir?

A great big bushy beard.Come on.
Let's have a nosey around.

locker room.

Riot room.

Evidenc room.

Now how 'bout a trip to the Andies?

Detective Sergeant Wainright
and Detective Constable Cockram.

Don't get up.

I you're wondering why
we call them Andies.

Both called Andrew?
They said that you were good.

Also because (i have no idea)
them up and struggles in it,Dad. 

Thank you,Donnie.

swearbox. All proceeds to the
church roof.

And this is ,where it all happens.

That is the Sergeant Tony
Fisher, PC Walt Walker,

And that is a Saxon.

And this is one Doris Fletcher.
She's our only policewoman.

She is not a policewoman.
Yes she is, I've seen her bra.

she is a police officer,
being a  woman has nothing to do with it.
A hardy comes in handy every so often

I could have given you the tour. I've
been around the station a few times.

And what's upstairs?

well,well,well I see we have visitors.

Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

Civilian liaison for the neighborhood watch.
 You'll find that we run

a very tight shift here.

From this command center, I can
see what the whole village is up to.

I must say I was rather admiring your hardy work last night,
it's a pity  

you couldn't do the same to those bloody hoodies,
Hanging around loitering, 

Actually I noticed some 
minor graffiti on the fountain.

Graffiti? They gotta be dealt
with Frank.

They're nippers Tom, they will come around.

Which reminds me, our old friend
the living statue was here Saturday.

11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock.

If we don't come down hard on these clowns, 
we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.

we'll get right on to it Tom.

We like to let them think they run the place.
Well, tha's that. Unless there's anything 
you're unclear about.

Yes Sir. Why is everybody 
eating chocolate cake?

The black porisgatto??? is on Donnie,
his punishment for his little indiscretion.

Sir, I don't think driving under the influence,
can be called  a little indiscretion.

No.The gatto is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

Last nights incident will require
something rather more serious.
Good.

Do you like ice cream?
I'm sorry sir, I don't follow.

Let's just say we won't be short
of junky-munky for the next month.


God.

Now, since it's your first day and it's
11:30, I would say that's lunch.

So, what made you choose
Sandford then ,Sergeant Angel?

It wasn't actually my choice.

Oh, right ,right, not your choice 
to come down here and tell me how
to do my job, our jobs.


Look i can assure you that it wasn't
my intention to upset the applicant.

Yeah. 'Cause we all sell apples
round here, don't we?

But Dad sells apples, Andie.
And raspberrys.

you can't wait to jump 
in Sergeant Popwell's grave. 

I'm not jumping into anyones grave.

You got a mustache.

I know.

Why do you keep wearing stab
vest for ? 

It's a requirement.

In the city maybe. But nobody
is gonna stab you here Sergeant.

Not member of the public anyway. 

Have you been stabbed 
Sergeant Fisher?

No.
Well I have.

And I can assure you it is 
not the least bit amusing.

you've seen a lot of action Sergeant Angel?
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

Cook any falls?
Excuse me?

Did you shoot anybody?
-He shot a crackhead with a kalashnitkov.

Where did you get that?
The offender had the kalashnitkov.
 
Where did he get that?

You do know that there are 
more guns in the country than in the city?


Everybody and their Mum's is packing round here.
Like who?

Farmers.
Who else?

Farmer's mums.

What is it like being stabbed?
It was the single most painful experience of my life.

What was the second most painful?

Did you ever fire two guns
whilst jumping off a vehicle?

No.

Did you ever fire one gun
whilst jumping off a vehicle?

No.

you ever been in a high speed
pursue?

Yes I have.

have you ever fired a gun 
whilst in high speed pursue?

No. "No more than one
schoolchild at any time "

That's Sergeant Angel coming into
your shop.????

What about Lethal Weapon?
No.

You seen Die Hard 2?
No.

Bad Boys 2?
No.

You ain't  seen Bad Boys 2?

Hell of a day,huh? 
Yep.

We get some more tomorrow?
Yep.

Amanda Haborn.Head mistress
of Sandford Primary. 

How do you do Sergeant?

Simon Skinner I believe you've met.
Oh yeah, We are already firm friends.

Please,please come with me.

This is Leslie Tiller.

Who's horticulture experteese has
helped put to Sandford on the map.

She is ever  good.
Oh go on.

This is James Reaper,
who owns Banigan farm.

I hear you are quite a match. Perhaps
you might like to join us for shooting one day.

Well I haven't held a  firearm for
about over  2 years Mr.Reaper,
and I would kinda like to keep it that way it.

You will be popular among
the local birds.

Hello,Reverend Shooter.

I want to ask you,would you read a
homily at the Sunday service?

That might be  a little hypocritical
of me  Reverend.

Oh, you are an atheistic.

No, I am open to the concept of
religion, i am just not entirelly 
convinced by it.

You are an  Agnostic.
I think I have a cream for that.

Robin Patcher, our resident in Sohommes?.
Hopefully we wont see too much 
 of each other the coming months.

All that is  to welcome you to
the weekly meeting of the neighborhood watch alliance.

Now quick announcement before beginning.
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

So congratulations to her.Tom.
Thanks Joyce.

Now...

I am sure that all you've noticed
the return of the blood to our streets.

It is all the more disturbing, as the 
village of the year contest noons.

I refer of course to the
extremely irritating living statue.

Police work is as much about preventing
crime, as it is about fighting crime.

Most importantly, it's about 
procedural correcness ,

in the execution of the
unquestionable moral  authority.

Any question?

Yes?

Is it true that there is a place in
a mans head, that if you shoot it, it'll blow up?

Hello. Tim Messenger.
Can I get a quick shot for the Sandford Citizen?

How 'bout you put the teacher in handcuffs?

I don't think it give off the right signals.
Too cheesypie.Ok, I get you.

Give the little blong kid your hat.
I'd rather not.

Oh,wave your stick about.
No.

??? long slender neck 
orange and black beak.

Anything else?

I's a swan.

It's gonna scare him.

No luck
catching them swans then?

I's just one swan actually.

You wan't anything from the shop?
You've just been to the shop.

I'm thinking of a different shop.

Officer Butterman this is not
the time of personal errands.

well,there's nothing going on is there?
-There is always something going on.

You have to look closer. Alright?

What about this guy?

Mr. Treacher?
Yeah, why has he got a big coat on?

he can't be cold. Why the extra
???? Maybe he's trying to hide something.

Mr. Treacher?

Ok.what about this guy? 

Ask yourself , why has he got his
hat fall down like that?

he is fuck ugly.
Or he doesn't want us to see his face.

Because he is fuck ugly.

OK. What's his story?

Oh, that's lurch.
Go on?

He is a trolleyboy at
 the local supermarket.

Real name  Michael Amstrong.

dad says he's got a child's mind.
ok. 

He lives up Summer street
with his mother and sister.

And are they as big as
he is? Who?

The mum and the sister?
Same person.

What show were you thinking of?

Fury Silente. Martial Arts master
versus it superhuman killingmachine.

Sergeant Angel to the Manager's Office.

Manager Office Sergeant Angel.

Ah, Sergeant Angel. Or is Angle?

Mr. Skinner is a baby's
sick in isle 6.

Please excuse. Michael.
Yes?

Child vomit in isle 6, mop it up.

Mr.Skinner is there a problem?
No, no.

i simply wanted to say how lovely 
to see you supporting yourlocal store.

Well that's quite allright.

All too many are defected by
the big megamarkt in Beauford Abbey.


their heads struck from their shoulders???.

Yes, well i am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

Of course. I simply spied you loitering on
organic produce and assumed you had time on your hands.

Well, maybe i am not the one
you should be keeping an eye on.

That's the fridge magnet,he's name is 
George Merchant, he has made
a fortune on kitchen goods.

Owns that monstrosity
in Norris avenue. 

Actually i wasn1t talking about him.
Pardon?

I was talking about him.

Ah.
Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Super cop. Meet the cop
that can't be stopped.

Trouble in High street. 
Sergeant Angel pursues to...

Received.

Good morning Sergeant.

You mothers

Come on.

For the gardens?
-What's the matter Dannie?

Have you never taken a shortcut before?

Hey. Gimme that.

You don't have to say anything,
English:)

Any thing you do say can
be given to evidence.

Hello Danni.
-Oh, Pierre.

Do you know this man?
He is Jackie's sister's brother's boy.

And it didn't occur to you  to mention this
before? I couldn't see his face,could I?
?? the eyes.

Impressive card.

Shame Mr.Skinner doesn't 
want to press charges.

What do you mean doesn't want to press charges?

I'm simply suggesting Peter
be given a second chance.

Before hee becomes
just another crime statistic.

I am sure he is going to learn
a valuable lesson.

Stealing biscuits is wrong?
Correct.

Oh thanks.

And yet we respond by not
taking a single punitive measure.

That's what make the cookie crumbles.
Right the biscuits, ain't it?

Mr. Skinner...
is everything all right?

Well sir,

Mr. Skinner feels it would be better not to 
prosecute an individual, that has comitted a 
blatant offence. 

Leave this with me. 
I'll make sure everyone gets their justice . 

27.
Have you ever seen Point Break?

No.

Amazing  group of surfers.
Don't tell me. 29.

Patrick Swayze just robs this bank. Keanu
Reeves's chasing him through people's gardens.

And he wants to shoot Swayze, but he can't
'cause he loves him so much.

And he's fireing gun up in the air and goes like Ahhhhh.
30.

have you ever fired your gun
up in the air and gone Aaahhhh?

No. I have not ever fired my 
gun up in the air and gone Aaahhhh.

30. Sorry. I just  feel like i am
missing out sometimes.

I want to do what you do.
You do do what I do.

What on earth do you think
you're missing out?

Gun fights,car chases, 
proper action and shit.

Police work is not about 
proper action or shits.

29.
If you would've payed attention to me in 

school, you'd understand that it's not all about
gunfights   

and carchases.

fire the roof 

That was brilliant.

Were i going a tad fast, officer?
Yes, you were Mr. Blower.

Well, you see we are staging a hommage
to William Shakespeare's drama
Romeo and Juliet


I am a little late for dress
rehersal.I am playing the eponymous hero.

Romeo, not Juliet.

What are you writing?
Everything you are saying. I might...

need to reffer to it later.
Now Officer , I am a respected solicitor

so there is no need to...
would you stop writing.

Look, I am merely trying to explain 
why I might have exceeded the speed limit. 

You are playing the mail lead in  hommage
to William Shakespeare's Romeo and juliet.

and you are late for the dress rehersal.
You think this is sufficien reason

to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?
Well..

The flat speed limits 
specifically were emplaced to save lives.

This is preposterous.
Preposterous.

look, stop writing.
Stop writing.

Look,

you are right, I apologize.

See what I did there?
You hypnotized him.

No. Use this. This is the most important
piece of equipment you'll ever own.


This notebook has sabed my skin  
more times than I care to mention.

You should think about
using yours more.

I do use mine.
Show me.

That's just extraordinary.
You should see the one on the other side.

What are you up to tonight?
I have to water my Peace Lilly.

I thought you might wanna do something.
What exactly were you thinking? 

I dunno. Pub?
I don't think that's a good idea.

See you.

Oi, you two.

A Mr. Blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.

Said it was  an apology.
Yeah?

Well,we can't accept gifts from 
somebody we officially reviwed, so..

Nicholas glad I caught you.

Wouldn't you mind representing us 
at the ??? tonight. 


Yes sir, of course.
And there is a spare one for Danni.

Hey, come on, it might be fun.

A trinket for the death.

Here's to my love.

Poison.

I'll kiss thy lips.

I'll take some poison for my.

Sergeant Angel, hello.

A quick word for
the Sandford Citizen.

It was very enjoyable.
A cop enjoys watching young lovers.

I don't think so.
Local ??? some teen suicide?

That's just grossly inappropriate.

You will spell his name correctly
this time,won't you Timothy?

Absolute tosh,wasn't it?

Annoyingly the owners are actually
professional actors.

Greg over there was an actor
in Strong Dogs and Sherry
portrayed a cadaver in a crime
suspect.

Sergeant Angel, you came. So thrilled
you accepted my invitation.

Well, Inspector requested
we attend.

we can't accept gifts from someone
we officially reviwed, so

jog on.

Congratulations to you and to Mrs. Blower.
This is not my wife. This is 

Miss Draper, my leading lady.

Eve works in the local Council
Sergeant. And quite a  lady indeed.

I am not.

Nonesense. I am sure if we bashed 
your head open, all sorst of secrets
woukld come dumpling out. 

Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bear for Romeo.

A pleasure.

Eve is nice, ain't she?
She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

Since I met her in school
always had a thong for her.

She clearly has a thing for older men.

Not with Martin Blower? No way.

We just have sit through 3
hours of so called acting, constable 

Their kiss was the only convincing moment in it.
Now that you come to mention, 

I too have a reason to believe
that she favors the older gents.

Really? How so?
My uncle Carl's big brother said that he had fingered 
her up, the dung hole.

Oh, Officer. 

Again let me extend my 
sincere apologies for earlier. 

All right Mr. Blower.
Drive safe.

Drive safe. Oh my god. You 
knew that was the bloke
we had for speeding earlier.

Yeah. Hopefully that's the last we'll
see of him.

Who is it?

We haven't got long.

To us.

Who is it?

Yeah?

Decapitated?

Libby found them.
That always paper round ??? .

They'll be having nightmares
for a while.Must have been
going at some speed.

Pulled the whole top off.
I would have my top off with this playboy?.

Lost the control,
Left the road there, and then ended up here.

So, what do we reckon?

Sergeant Angel.
We should put a cordon,to off screen

remains from public view, close down the
road until the ambulance car arrives, 

whereupon we should open a single line
of traffic and aid congestion.

Very good.

What he said.

What happened Danni?
Car accident.

Nasty way to go.

Constable,Official Vocab Guideline statement,
we no longer refer to these incidents 

as accidenst ,but collisions.
All right.

There was never was a story of 
more woe than this of Juliet
and eternal Romeo.

Excuse me?
Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

Mr. Skinner do you mind telling me 
how you know about the identity of 
the persons involved?


You know how it is,
news travels fast. 

What happened Danni?
Traffic collision.

Why can't we say accident, again?

Because  accident implies
there's nobody to blame.

Put a stocking in a town mouse.
Yeah.You want to be a big cop 
in a small town?

Fuck off in a rural village ????
I am just saying thing aren't 


always as simple,as they look.
Most times they are.


Let's just wait till dr.Pretchett
comes back with something.

Before you go jump ing the kalashtnikov.

Allright, in the meantime
why don't you, check out
a few of Martin Blowers clients? 

Martin Blower represent damly most the village.
You want us to call the whole phonebook?

We will call into R... and A...,shall we?
Please, don't be childish.

At least consider interviewing the
widow, Martin Blower was clearly 

having an affaire with Eve Draper.
And how did you establish that?

Because we sat throug 3 hours of so called acting 
last night, and the kiss was the only 

convincing moment in it.
All right. Defend him.

Yeah what else You've got crocky and tubby?
Skid marks.

Now, who's being childish?
There were no skid marks in the street.

Doesn't it seem a little strange 
that Martin Blower would loose control
of his car and not think to apply the 
brakes? 

If there were no skidmarks that follows for
300 yards,both driver and passenger 

did nothing to prevent their fate. You
don't have to be a detective to work that out.

Are they causing trouble?
Yes, they are.

Well spot a bother up at Elroy Farm. 
Old Arthur Webbley has been clipping
hedge rose, that don't belong to him.


Yes sir?
that's it.

Yes sir.

Why do we need the dog.
It's not the dog we need.

Right.

What did he say?

What did he say?

He said a hedge is a hedge. He only chopped
it down, 'cause it's blocked his view.

Whats the problem about?

I appreciate your position Mr. Webley, but
you can't go...

round chopping other people's
hedges without permission.

Yes, I suppose.
Thank you.

Allright.

Mr. Webley, I trust that
you have licence for that firearm.

He does for this one.

What do you mean by this one?

For the power of Christ.

Where on earth did you get these?

He found them.
And what is this?

It is a sea mine.

Well,Mr. Webley this it is an 
extremely dangerous collection.

It is wonder that nobody's
been hurt before.

Na, it's a load of junk.

Move, move.

Are you hurt?
No,apparently it's been deactivated, over.

It's not live. Deactivated.
It's not live.

It is not live.
All right.

That was quite an impressive haul today,
constable,wasn1t it?
Yeah. Maybe we should do something to celebrate.

Besides watering your Peace lilly.
What do you have in mind?

I don't know.

Pub?

Yes sirs, what can i get you?

Pint o' lager,please Roy... and what 
can i get you that isn't cranberry juice?

I don't really wanna get drunk.
-You'll get a  little drunk.

I'll have one.
Yeah, that's what i'm talking about.

Mr. Porter what's your wine selection?
We got red or...

white.

I'll have a pint of lager please.

Any news from earlier?
Yeah. CSI found nothing.

Dr. Patcher  report
no misadventure,

and Mrs. Blower has 4 alibis.
-Come on Sergeant.

It's not your job
to investigate ??,is it?

Is it?
No. It isn't.

You don't switch off, do you?
You sound like my ex.

But you are always thinking away.
That's what I do.

Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
Really?

What made you wanna be a policeman?
Officer.

What made you wanna be a 
policeman, Officer?

I don't remember a time, when
I didn't wanna be a police officer.

Up till the summer of 1979 when
I wanted to become a .

It all started with my uncle Derrick.
he was a Sergeant of the Met.

He bought me a police
pedal car, when I was five. 

I rode round in every
second i was awake.

Arresting kids twice my
size for littering and spitting.

I got beaten up a lot when  was young,but
didn't stop me.I wanted to be like uncle Derrick.

Sounds like a good bloke.
Actually he was arrested...

for selling drugs to students.
What a cunt.

He probably bought the pedal
car with the proceeds.

Needlless to say, I never
went near it again.

I just let it rust. But I never forgot the clear
sense of right and the wrong that I felt ...

at the wheel of that pedal car. I had to
prove to myself that the law...

could be proper, and righteous and for the 
good of human kind.

It was from that moment i
was destened to be a police officer.

Shame.
-How so?

Because you would've made a great muppet. 

What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

I don't know. Dad does it.

I think after my mum died, that's what he wanted,
you know, keep me close by. 

Do you mind if I ask how she died?
-Traffic collision.

I am sorry.

Never mind. Hey whatch this. 

Jesus Christ.
Oh my eye.

Do you want another?

Hello 777.
Mr. Skinner.

You know George Merchant,don't you?

Yes, we were just discussing the accident.
I knew Martin and Eve well.

It's such a loss.
Let's  say we drink to their demise.

Should not we drink to their memories?
-Of course. Cheers.

I must go to the little boys room?

I'm allright. 
Little be inoperative word.

He'll be in bed tomorrow.

I think somebody needs to go home.
I am not that drunk Sir

Not you.

Him. What?

Hey, we did get a little drunk.
You get it, because he is little,
and he is drunk.

This is my mansion. He/she doesn't have anything that
to do with the rustic hairdresser of the town.???

How much do I owe you?
20 quid.

There you go.

And there is your change.
God bless you, bye-bye.

I am allright.

I would not wanna be him in the morning.

Oh, this is me.
Well. I am sure I'll see you in the morning.

Unless you want
to come in for a cup of coffee.

I don't drink coffee.

Tea?
No caffeine after midday.

How about another beer?

When did you move in?
About 5 years ago.

You should get some house plants.
oh, yeah.

I've been turning? my peace lilly for 3 years now.

It oxygenates the room, helps you think, relieves
stress, it's needs are simple.

Janine used to say,that I loved
my lilly more than i loved her.

Is that why you split up?
What?

Because you've done it with a plant?

No, no, no. It's more 
about me being obsessed 
with the job.

That's good though, right?

Is it though, I miss a few dinners
parties, a birthday or two.

Listen mate...
-Her dad's funeral.

I just wanna be good at what i do.
You are good at what you do.

You just can't learn to
switch off, that big old melon of yours.

That's the whole problem Danni.

I don't think i know how.
I could show you how.

By the power of Christ.

Point Break or Bad Boys 2?
Which one do you think I'd prefer?

No, I mean which one do you to whatch first.
You are pulling my leg.

What did you think of that?

Well, I won't argue it was a
travel without barriers full with adrenaline,

but there is not form of arming that whole chaos
without considering the whole paper work that takes.

That is nothing man. This
is about to go off.

Shit just got real.

Nasty way to go.

Look like Mr. Merchant tried to have
a little fry-up and left the gas on.

Spends his whole life devoted to the
refrigerator, and gets killed by an owen.

I told him several times. 
You shouldn't eat late at night.

I kindda like a little midnight gobble.

So, what do we reckon? Angel?
Huh?

Help me.

OK. We get a proper cordon up,
we let the firecrew finish their stuff,

and then we get the forensic surgeons
to do a ???.
Right.

What he said.
Sergeant Angel a quick word.

Mr. Messenger a statement will
be issued shortly.

Actually I would just like to as:
What's your perfect Sunday?

I will deal with the press Sergeant.
A Perfect Sunday is a lovely long...

What do you think?Foul play?
Maybe.

We're just hoping to talk to the 
last people, who saw Mr. Merchant alive.

Maybe a Sergeant Nicholas Asswipe
and Constable Funny ???.

Beautiful.
-Why is this such a big joke to you?

3 people have died in one week.
Oh come on Dr. Sherlock. they were accidents.

Accidents happen every day.
The victims knew each other.

Everyone knows everyone around here.
-Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,

then who did?

It's bit of a blind spot I am afraid. We
just catch the very edge of the explosion.
 
Well, you had a go.
I've got something took my eye.

Really. what's that?

Sanfords most wanted.

There you go,it is the swan you want.
This is not funny detective.

You do your job and we'll
do ours.

Yeah,I mean you got a church thing to look out??.
NO,I'VE NOT.

Actually..

"Save the church roof"

Seen any murderings ?

Come on boys ,leave the Sergeant
Angel alone.He is working.

Sorry Chief. Won't waste
any more police time.

actually you just might as well take a break.
hey,great. Got something to show you.

This isn't rifle match.
-You'll be really good at it.

Feeling lucky Sergeant?

3 cans wins you the squeky bunny,5 cans
gets you the fluffy lion,take all our little 
people,

you'll get ... cuddly monkey.

I thought I made it clear 
to you, how I feel about firearms.

It is a toy rifle.
Sergeant.

Good Lord.

That was amazing.

Thank You Danny.
I cannot believe I shot someone.

He is a Doctor. He can deal with it.
It never shot anyone before.

Believe me it's not something you'll
ever get used to.

Maybe we should go to the bouncing
castle and take our minds off there.

Mr. Messenger.

I need to talk to you about 
George Merchant.Alone.

Churchyard,3 o'clock.

What do you think he want's?

Sergeant Angel come
take the stage please.

Here to announce the winners, is the 
newest adittion to the Sandford Police Force.

Service.
-Sergeant Nicholas Angel.

Prick.
Wanker.

The first name is...

Simon Skinner.

He is in the loo.
Too much of Joyce's lemonade perhaps.

And the next name is...

Tim Messenger.

Tim.?

Excuse me, excuse me.

Stand Back, stand Back. There's
been a terrible accident.

Nicholas.What is it?
Sir, I think all these deaths...

are linked. I think 
Tim Messenger was murdered.

Who could do something like this?
-Maybe it was the  swan?

Apperantly it could break a man's arm
or blow up a man's  house.

Listen you pair of ...

Whoe, whoe Nicholas.

Let me get this straight.

Are you saying that this
is a crime scene?

Yes Sir I am.

Very well.

Detectives.

Secure the area.
What?

PC Fletcher?
-Yes luv.

Get the  CSI down here.
PC Walker?

Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

Nicholas, Danni.
You know what to do.

Do you really think this is murder?

I just  don't think we should rule it 
out, that's all.

Yeah, I think you are right.

He thinks you are talking a load of 
shit. At least that understood?.

Did you find anything?
Yeah. I was extremely shocked

when I looked at my watch and discovered, i should be in the pub.
Did you go to his house, did you read his articles?

If you want to read through a sack of  
Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.

It's your job, isn't it,to detect.
This is not a sickie Mr. Angel.

Not everyone is a murdering psychopath.

It's high time you realized that.
You and your monkey.

Did he mean me, or that?

Maybe we should go.
What do you mean?

Nothing going on, is there?

Have you listened to anything that I've said?
What do you mean?

Is there anything that I told you in the last two weeks

that got into that thick skull of yours?
-Yeah.

Has it ? What?

You said i could be an amazing
policeman officer.

There is always something going on Danni. 
And you won't be an amazing police
officer

until you understand that.
-Well, I remember something else
you said ,and all..

Oh did you now?
-Yeah. You don't know how to switch off.

Allright.

Thanks for the monkey.

For that?
-I won it for you.

Danni I think I am on to something.
Are you?

Yes. And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

We?
-Come on partner.

Let's go to work.

Oh, Sergeant Angel, someone
from London called for you.

Tell them I call them back.

Tim Messenger, editor and journalist of  
Sandford Citizen.
-Aha
Promise of proms?.
-Go on.

Terrible speller. Never the less
accomodates important information 
of that

George Merchant.
Self made millionaire.

Fancys himself as a property developer.
He said he had big plans for Sandford.

Pissed on the floor in the crowd.

But more importantly he was a
good friend and client of...

Martin Blower.
Respected solicitor.


-Leading lad of the local Drama Society 

Bad actor.
Undoubtedly.

Bad driver.
Not necessarily.

cheat on his Mrs.
Most certainly. And we both know
who with...

Eve Draper. Blower's leading
lady. Distinctive laugh.

True.
-Favored older men.

Finger.
-worked at?

Council.
More specifically?

Department of Planning and Development.
Where George Merchant secured permission,

to build his jubious mansion
on Norris avenue.

So?

Maybe they were all  accidents.

People have
accidents every day.

What are yu two up to?
Nothing.

Well,look sharp,
'cause been reports of fire 
in the station.
-what?

Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday to you.

Danni why didn't you say something?
We were working,weren't we?

Hey, where are you going?
I have something to do???

Hello Ms. Tiller. I was wondering
do you have any Japanese Peace Lillys?

Of course. It was just about to
pop off actually.

I never find my scissors.
It's for someone special?

Yes, yes it is.

Are you going somewhere  Ms. Tiller?
Yes, I am moving away.

Why the move? If you
don't mind me asking.

Well, just between you and I.
Yes?

You know the fellow, that blew up?
George Merchant?

Well George Merchant god rest him 
wanted to buy this land.

So he sent round his legal fellow Martin
Blower god rest him.

I thought I might take them upon it 
I really haven't got that much family 
round here

save for cousin Sissi. So I thought I might
take them up to Aunt Roman move to Buford Abbey.

Would you like a card with this?
No. 

Sorry, you were talking about the offer.
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower...

god rest him, knew avenue bypass road is
coming 'cause he was knocking up Eve Draper
from the Council, god rest her   

And then that reporter, god rest him,
finds out about the road and tells me 
this land  

is very valuable,  10 times than George
Merchant and Martin Blower, god rest them, offered me.

So with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it all myself to
some folks from the city 

that Martin, George and Eve, god rest them
have been talking to .Apparently

they want to build a big shopping
center or something. Of course
cousin Sissi won't be too happy about that.

But as far as i am concerned cousin 
Sissi can go fu.. 
Would you just excuse me for just one second?

Stop.

In the name of the law.

hang on there, hang on there. You
are saying this wasn't an accident?

Leslie Tiller was
fucking murdered.

Just like Tim Messenger?
Yes.

George Merchant?
Yes.

And Eve Draper?
Yes.

Martin Blower?
No, actually.

Really?
'Course he fucking was.

Thank You Danni.

Murder, murder. Change the fucking
record. Thank You Andie.

Come on Sergeant,you've just gotta 
accept it was just another nasty accident.

What are you suggesting? That Leslie Tiller 
tripped and fell on her own shears?


Ben Fletcher fell on his pitchfork
the other week.

Yes, accidents happen all the  time,
what makes you think it was murder?

Because I was there.
Here is a point,
why were you there?

I was buying Constable Butterman
a japanese Peace lilly for his birthday.

What absolute shit.
I chases a suspect from the scene.

Innocent people don't run.
Maybe it was our old friend the cactus thief.

Oh yeah, he was a prickly customer, wasn't he?

Am I going completely mad?

Maybe, you are.

Maybe you did it.

Yeah. Since you are such a 
big fan of murders.

What the fu...!
Sergeant Angel?

Yes!

Sir

Nicholas Nicholas. What am I going to 
do with you?
Sir, you have to understand...

No. Your you have to understand.

The boys here aren't used to the 
concepts you are bending? about.

The M word Nicholas. There hasn't been
a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.

But Sir I am
certain. And what's more,

I know who did it.

Can I see the manager please?

Mr. Skinner to the manager's office.
The manager's office Mr. Skinner.

Sergeant Angel? And to what do I owe this pleasure?
Simon Skinner I am arresting you on suspicion ...

of the murder of Leslie Tiller.
Leslie Tiller is dead?

How?
-She tripped and fell on her own shears.

I'm also arresting you on suspicion for the 
murder of Tim Messenger on May 1,

of George Merchant 29 April and Eve
Draper and Martin Blower April 28.

Why on earth would I do that Sergeant?
I am glad you asked.

My suspicions were first
aroused, when you came to the scene of the...

Blower and Draper death on the outskirts
of Sandford, despite the fact,

you live and work in the centre of the village.

I couldn't help, but recall your comments
in the theater, the previous evening.

Not only indicate the awareness of the 
couples affaire, but also infered that

these connections of the Council  
might make her preview to 
important information.

You even spoke of bashing her head,
perhaps hoping you might discover 
the route of 


the proposed Sandford bypass. You
were already suspicious that George Merchant...

was buying up a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford, after an

article Tim Messenger wrote
in the Sandford Citizen .

You see the land Merchant was buying
had little value in itself, but...

if it became an accessable byroad ,
It'll be a prime location, for say,

a retail park. Consumed and
concerned for your business and potential...

disloyalty of fickled customers
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

You killed the competetition in cold blood.
Framing the murders as accidents.

I used a vehicle removal truck to 
stage the Blower-Draper death. And incinerated

an old man,in his own house
???? try to cover up with the application of bacon and beans.

However, there was a loose end.

Tim Messenger. Splattered,before he
could share with me ,what he told


Leslie Tiller that very afternoon. The
true value of her land.

Upon descovering she was about to 
sell up to the developers,

you brutally murderer 
her with her own shears.

And may could you escape
utilizing your impressive skills

as a fun runner.

Very entertaining, but I rather
think you've been watching too many films.

He hasn't.

Why would I kill Leslie? You clearly
aren't aware, that we are related.

Oh, but I am.

Cousin Sissi.

I'm afraid my nickname of Sissi
is only a revelation to yourself.

My teenage years of studying
ballet are well-known.

Yeah. Sissi Skinner.
Or gay lord.

Thank You Andrews.

Now, despite my comments about
beheading customers, I personally...

relish the competition of another store.
Anything to energize

my work force.

And anyway,what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the  

churchal roof.Or for that
matter the rage??? of God.

It's a well-known fact that the church
roof is in dieing need of repair.


And isn't it true, that 2 of your
own employees operate the vehicle removing service
for the castle?

Sergeant. This is the century 21. Many 
people hold down several jobs.I myself 

 am teacher of a drawing class.???
Tina here is a table dancer at Flatley.

Nevertheless you could've utilized
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

These accusations are quite meaningless
Sergeant, unless you can back them

up with hard evidence.

Well, you1ve got me there.

I need something conclusive.

Something that'd place you at
the scene of the crime.

Perhaps a wound from a piece
of broken glass  this very evening.

This very evening.

This is beggining to get emberrasing.
How could I possibly be several...

places at once?

I am sure the store security
footage will absolve me.

Do feel free, to spool through.

I can handle this Danny. You might as
well go back and enjoy the rest of your
birthday.

Did you really get me that plant?
Yes, I did. But...

it's been impounded as evidence.

If you find something you let me know,heh?
Yeah.

Sergeant I wanted you to know that if I
do indeed now own the land belonging to..

belonging to Leslie, i intend
to turn in into a memorial garden, in her
honour.

Mr. Skinner what you do with your land
is of no concern of mine, so...

jog on.

Michael will you escort the 
Sergaent off the premises, 
when he is quite finished? 

I just can't believe Leslie's
dead. How did it happen?

she tripped and fell on her own
shears.

"Twat."

hey,that weren't me.

Hey, look, look Mr. Treacher's
got his big coat on again.

you want anything from the shop?
A Corneto.

No luck cathcing them killers then?
It's just one killer actually.

No luck cathcing them killers then?
It's just one killer actually.

what's the matter? You've got brain freeze?
No i got brain wave.

get us back to the station. Now.

It's more than one person.
-What?

It's more than one killer.
It was Skinner a minute ago.

Yeah,well,maybe still is,you know, maybe
he is not alone.Maybe there are others.

Nicholas. You are an exceptional officer.
But I've seen this before. 

Sir?
Sergeant Pumpwell.

It was exactly the same thing. You've come from the
city where there's danger round every corner.

And it's driven you round the bend .
-Yes sir.

Do yourself a favor.

sleep on it.

And if you still feel the same in 
the morning,I give you my word, 
I'll get right on it.

hey,hey.

What's happening, what's going on?
-Nothing,nothing. I am just gonna go
back to the hotel.

Do you want a lift?
No, no. I could do with a walk.

Hey biggo.

Playtime's over.

Michael?Michael?

Are you there?

Michael. is everything ok?

Yearp.

Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?
Yearp.

he is not gonna get back up again?

Narp?

Good. proceed to the castle.

Frank, this shit just got real. Skinner just
sent someone to kill me. And 
now,now,he1s gone somewhere.

Um, up to the castle I think.I'm gonna 
go after him,ok? It is Nicholas by the way.

Oh my god.

What happened to your Peace Lilly?
Danni,Danny, just stay here,Ok?

And watch him and call your
Dad. Tell him that I was right.

what you're gonna do?
I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.

Nicholas wait.

You might need this.
Thanks partner.

How could I possibly be 
in several places at once?


I just can't beleive that Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

You will find that we run a very tight
shift here.

Who could do something like this?

It seems that Mr. Merchant tried
to have a little fry up and left
the gas on.

what a nasty way to go.

What happened Danni?
No luck catching them killers?

"Fountain restoration completed
in 1993, with thanks to"

A quick announcement before we begin.

Janet Barker has decided to call her boys
Roger and Martin. And the christening will be...

a week, on Saturday, and
we are all  invited. Tom?

Thank You Joyce.

Now,

you'll all be delighted to hear
that the tenacious sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.  

Joyce will discover the Sergeant
laying on the wet floor on his 
bathroom,  

having slipped and 
tragically broken his neck.

So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant 
we would now be able to concentrate on
the eradication...

of our hoodie infestations.

Until which, nothing
will stand in our way.


Oh, I beg to differ Mr.Weaver.
Well,well,well. I see we have visitors.

Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police service.

My, he is tenacious,isn't he?
I'm arresting you under suspicion of ...

conspiracy to commit murder.

Oh, come,come sergeant.
-You should be ashamed.

Calling yourself a community that cares.
But we do care Nicholas.

It's all about the greater good.
The greater good.

How can this be for the greater good?
The greater good.

You see, as much as enjoy your theory sergeant,
the truth is far less complex.

Blowers fate was simply the result of 
his being an appaling actor.

appaling.
You murdered him for that?

well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
What?

The dramatic society is an 
important feather in our  cap.

Couldn't let Blower jeopardized
that knowing we had 2 semiprofessionals 
waiting in the wings.

Let's not forget that Greg was
excellent in Strong Dogs,

and Shelly portrayed a cadaver in.. .
-Yes, I know.

Martin was less concerned with the 
reputation of the village,
then he was with his sordid
affaire with Eve Draper.  

And so Eve deserved to die too?
She did have a very annoying laugh.

Annoying.
And George Merchant?

he had an awfull house.

Awfull.
We begged him in vain to make

his residence more in keeping
with the village's rustic static.

And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

Tim Messenger 10 years editor of 
Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.

Our once great paper,
have become riddled with tabloid
journalism.

Not to mention persistent errors.

He listed our ages 55,
when actually i am 53.

What about Leslie Tiller one of your own,
her horticultural  expertise

 helped put Sandford on the map.
Oh she was ever so good.

Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

But it seems she was set on moving
away.

We could not have her sharing our 
green fingers with anybody else. 

Not least those  ?? in Buford Abbey.
If we can't have her, noone can. 

How can this be for the greater good?
The greater good.

Shut it.

These people died for no reason,
no reason whatsoever.

Oh,I wouldn't say that.

Hello Nicholas.

I was like you once.

I believed in the immutable
word of the law.

That is until the night Mrs. Butterman
was taken from me.

You see noone loved Sandford
more than her.

She was head of the womens institute
chair of the floral comitee. 

when they started the village of the 
year contest, she worked around the
clock.  

I never seen such dedication.

On the eve of the judicators arrival
some travellers moved into Callahan Park. 

Before you could say gypsy scum, 
we were knee deep in dog mog
peeving kids and crusty jugglers


Crusty jugglers.

We lost the  title, and
Irene lost her mind.

She drove her Daihatsu Cherry into Sandford
Gorge.

That moment on, I swore that I would 
do her proud, and whatever the cost, 

we would make Sandford great again.
Sir. this doesn't make any sense.

The judicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

You're saying this is all about
winning the best village award?

This is the best village, Nicholas.

You've seen the people,
they are happy. Contented.

They're living in a dreamworld. 
Sergeant Popwell thought much the same as you.

I am disappointed you can't see
the bigger picture.

Well, i am happy to disappoint you sir, and I am afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

You're all gonna have to come with me.
No Nicholas.

I'm afraid it is you, who is going to
have to come with us .

Danni no.

Back off,back off.

Or I swear to God, you will be 
 ????a Danny ???coffin his head


Come on Nicholas you haven't got any in you.
I mean it.

Gypsy scum, travelers,
lowbred boys.

There has not been a recorded 
murder in Sandford in 20 years.

Spot a bother up in Elroy farm.

A great big bushy beard.

Danni.

What are you doing?
Saving your skin.

This is murder.
It's not, It's ketchup.

I 'm not talking about that, I am
talking about the others.
What others?

The others, the NWA have murdered.
That's not true.

It it is.
Dad just said it was this special clubby.
I thought it was about rubbing people in the 
knuckles and ??? them on their way.

There are skeletons back there.
I don't know nothing about no skeletons.

What did you think was happening?
Not this.

It's Frank he is appointing himself
judge, jury and executioner.

He is not judge, jury and executioner.
He is.You gotta help me take him down.

I can't.

He is my Dad.Take my car.

Go back to London.

There is nothing you can do.
I can come back.

I can come back and I can bring the blue furious
Metropolitan Police Service with me.

And make it disappear? Who are they gonna believe?
My Dad or a looney London police officer?

Then help me, we can
do it together. Your and me. Partners.

Forget it Nicholas. It Is Sandford.

"London. "

Is that everything?

Sir?

Sir?

Is there anything i can do for you?

No.

This is something that I have
that to do myself.

"Welcome to Sandford. "

Another beautiful day in God's country.

Danni?

It's...

Mum.

What are you gonna do?

Just walk in and arrest the 
whole village?

Not exactly.

Sergeant Angel, someone from
London called for you.

I'll tell them you'll ring her back.

Well, that's funny?
-What's that?

I didn't know we had 
a mounted division .

Nobody tells me nothing.

Wanna do something useful?

Sergeant Angel's
back, check out his horse.

Roger back???.

It's...

Angel.

Morning.

That's what I am talking about.

still feel that you're missing out?

Fascist.

Hag.

Stop.

Stop this,please.

You have to stop this
mindless violence.

Nicholas my son,

you may not be a man of God.
but surely you are a man of peace.

I may not be a man of God,
reverend,but I know right and I know wrong.

And I have the good grace
to know which is which.

Oh, fuck off grasshopper.

Jesus Christ. Nicholas?

I thought you was a gonner.

Drop your weapons.
Dr. Patcher no.

Shut up Danni.

I brought you into this world, think
it's rather fitting, i should be the 
one to take you out of it.

You and your interfeering little friend.

Drop 'em.

Your you are a Doctor. Deal with it.
Yeah motherfucker.

Danni let's roll.
-What are you thinking?

Pub?

Somebody call the police!
Freeze.

Officers. Arrest that man.

Danni step away from the Sergeant.
No Dad.

Danni, you'll do as you're told.

I'm not taking orders from you any more.

Officers, arrest these men.
Wait, wait.

You can arrest us if you like, you can
throw us in prison and then go

back to being blind submissive slaves,or you can be real 
Police Officers could help us 

bring an end to this absurd history.
what the fuck is he on about?

Fuck are you on about?
Have you ever wondered why

the crime rate in Sandford is so low?
And yet the accident rate is so high?

No. Yes. What?
You've been brainwashed Tony.

Brainwashed into deniality??? by an old man
with a murderous obsession.


This is ridiculous.
No, it's not Dad.

It's very unridiculous. It's only now that i 
started to realize, how unridiculous it all is.

Silence Danni.

Think of your mother.
Mum is dead, Dad.

For the first time in my
life, you know i am glad

if she could see what you've become
,then she would probably kill herself 
all over again.

I am completely lost.
Sandford is a lie Doris.

For the last 20 years, the 
village has been controlled by Frank
and the NWA.


They had  everyone to believe this is 
a perfect village, and kill anyone...

who's threatened to change that.

He says he reckons, you've got something there.
I know.

You're not seriously gonna believe
this man, are you?

Are you?

he is not even from around here!

Maybe,it's time to give it up
Sir.

You incompetent flat folks.

Officer Walker, stay
here with Saxon and hold everything down.

Officers, let's go.

what about Dad?
He'll come round again.

want anything from the shop?

What are you thinking of bro?
We strike now, while we

got the element of surprise,
we're gonna wait more time they got them mobilized. 
i say we go in through the front entrance

take the place isle by isle.
They won't be expecting that.

Very good. What he said.

My,my, here come the fuzz.

Who enters first?
Wait here.

Don't go in on your own.
Don't worry, he knows what he is doing.

They are in.

You deal with the store,
I deal with the trolleyboy.

Wait,wait,wait. Listen to me
,listen,listen.

Is this what you really-really want?

Yearp.

Suit yourself.

Go.Go,Go.

.Andie!

It'all right Andie, it's just ..naise.

How's lurch?
He is in the freezer.

Did you say you "Cool off"?
No, I didn't say anything actually.

Shame.
it was a bit earlier one that you missed

when i distracted him with the cuddly monked
and then I said "playtime is over"


Then i hit him with the peace lilly.
-You're fucking changed?.

What's the situation?
Two butchs and a fuck load of cutlery.

What do you reckon?

Idea.

Yeah.
Good work everyone.

Nice work Doris.
Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.

Fruit attack.

Can you handle this Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go up to the big boss.

Allright Sergeant.

Dani let's rock.
Angel.

Don't go being a twat.
I won't give you the satisfaction.

We should get down there.
-How?

skip.

Had some fun?
-fuck yeah.

I'll drive.
jump in.

launch that shit.

"Good luck Sandford. "

Swan!

swan!

stay back.

Or the gingernut gets it.

You little fucker

It's not your village any more.

You did good, kid.

Whats your name?
-aaron aronson

Sorry?

it's over  Danni.

it's over.

It really hurts.

I'm gonna need some ice cream.

Don't worry, there is plenty of
ice cream in the station.

isn't that right Danny?
-Stay back.

Finish it Frank you silly bastard.
Not.We don't want any more blood shed.

Frank, this whole thing started,
because you lost somebody you loved.

Don't expect me to beleive,
you'll let it end the same way.

I'll tell you how this is gonna end.

I feel like I should say something
smart.

You don't have to say anything at all.

Now my perfect Summer,would begin with...

What do you say Nicholas?
We have been trying to reach you 

for days.
Yeah,well, I've been kind of busy.

We need you back. The figures
have gone a little squiffy

in your absence.
-come back to London. Sandford is 

hardly a fitting place for 
such an exceptional officier.
Yeah, well, the thing is..

I kinda like it here. Besides 
we have to do a considerable 
amount of paper work.

This is gonna take ages.
Yeah, it'll take all night.

But we've got the menpower, hey Andie?
-Well,Official Vocab Guideline,

states we say staff and not
manpower, 'cause manpower's a
bit sexist.

You don't mind a little menpower,
do you Doris?

Oh,Dirty bastard.

You cheeky fucker.

Your you know what you are?

A bloody busy mummy .

.No!

Oh God No.

Danni.

Danni.

Oh God. Hold on Danny, just hold on.

Hold on, it's gonna be fine.

everything's gonna be fine.

"one year later. "

Hope these are okay.

Yeah,they are lovely.

"loving memory of
Irene Butterman "

Any officers near the church?
-Go ahead Doris.

Chief had a report about some
hippy messing with the recycling
bins at the supermarket. 

Leave it with us.
Received.

Sergeant Butterman,

Littlehand says it's time to Rock n Roll.
Brings the noise.
