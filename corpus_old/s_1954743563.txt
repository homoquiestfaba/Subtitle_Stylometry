                   OUCH.

      WHAT?

                    JUST JOKING.

                   YOU'RE DOING
                   A GREAT JOB.

      YOU RAT.

YOU SCARED ME.

                   PEACH?

          I CAN'T DIE
          ON CHRISTMAS.

            YOU'LL GO

      ARE YOU GETTING READY
         FOR YOUR TRIP?

OH! YES.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

[CHUCKLES HAPPILY]

       HOW ARE YOU, GINA?

       WE WANT TO HAVE YOU
        AND THE BOYS OVER

FOR DINNER, OKAY?

           THANK YOU.

         COME ON, GUYS.

          GOOD MORNING,
          KELL FAMILY.

       I JUST WISH PEOPLE
     WOULD STOP DOING THAT.

      THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.

      THEY JUST DON'T KNOW
        WHAT ELSE TO DO.

       I KNOW, AND IT'S--
 I'M SO GRATEFUL. I JUST... I--

    HAVE YOU-- HAVE YOU FOUND
  A REPLACEMENT FOR PATTIE YET?

          NO, NOT YET.

   WELL, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
      APPLYING FOR THE JOB.

    IT'D BE GREAT TO BE BUSY,

       AND I COULD BE HERE
  JUST IN CASE MY BOYS NEED ME.

        YOU'D BE PERFECT.

     FRANKLY, WE'D BE LUCKY
          TO HAVE YOU.

          [BELL RINGS]

      OKAY, BOYS, LET'S GO.

           BYE, GUYS.

OKAY! HURRY UP.
GO STRAIGHT TO YOUR ROOM.

   HOW CAN I POSSIBLY BE LATE?

           I ONLY HIT
     THE SNOOZE BUTTON TWICE

   AND I MADE INSTANT COFFEE,

WHICH, BY THE WAY, TASTES
LIKE A BROWN CRAYON.

SORRY.

WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

PLEASE JUST GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO DO

SO THAT I DO NOT
FEEL SO USELESS.

       OH, YOU'VE ALREADY
          DONE SO MUCH.

       OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

       THERE IS SOMETHING
           YOU CAN DO.

         I WANT TO STOP
   THE MEAL DELIVERY SERVICE.

I CANNOT LOOK AT THAT RED COOLER
    ON MY PORCH ANOTHER DAY.

     I CAN WHIP OUT A TEXT,

      BLAST A FACEBOOK POST
          AND A TWEET,

  BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN STOP ME.

             THANKS.

             I JUST,
  I WANT TO COOK FOR THE BOYS,

       I WANT THINGS TO BE
     AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE.

        OF COURSE YOU DO.

     THEY'VE BEEN SO BRAVE.

        PLEASE DON'T CRY.

I AM NOT CRYING.
I CAN'T CRY.

       I AM TOO DEHYDRATED
    FROM A LACK OF CAFFEINE.

    LET'S GO GET SOME COFFEE.

     YEAH. THAT'D BE GREAT.

                 SEE YOU LATER,
                 PATTIE!

BYE, YOU GUYS!

      YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

         [DAD WHISPERS]

      THAT'S MICHAEL SPEHN.

CATHY'S STILL
IN THE HOSPITAL.

                         SHE IS?

             SHE WAS
             AT MATT'S FUNERAL.

            THEY WERE
            OLD SCHOOL FRIENDS.

              SHE WAS FINE THEN.

WELL, SHE WENT INTO
THE HOSPITAL LAST WEEK

WITH A HEADACHE.

                     A HEADACHE?

YES! I'M SURE
SHE'LL BE OUT SOON.

I MEAN, SHE'S
YOUNG AND HEALTHY.

  WHAT CAN HAPPEN?

    I'M SO SORRY.
    THAT WAS--

                   IT'S ALRIGHT.

       YOU'RE RIGHT.
       I'M SURE SHE'LL BE FINE.

YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WOULD MAKE
   THIS DINNER WAY MORE YUMMY?

    SOME GIANT MARSHMALLOWS.

       WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
            STAY HERE

      AND I'M GONNA GO DOWN
         TO THE BASEMENT

     AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANY.

     I'LL TAKE THE ELEVATOR.

           DING-DONG!

         MM-MM-MM-MM...

     NOPE, WE'RE ALL OUT OF
          MARSHMALLOWS,

       BUT FOR LITTLE BOYS
      WHO EAT THEIR DINNER,

    THERE WILL BE ICE CREAM.

          GOOD MORNING, MICHAEL.

         HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

YEAH. I'M FINE.

               WE'RE ALL
               PRAYING FOR YOU.

  HOW DOES THAT WORK, EXACTLY?

              WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I PRAYED REALLY HARD
FOR CATHY TO GET BETTER.

SO WHAT HAPPENED?

I MEAN, I DIDN'T
PRAY HARD ENOUGH?

IS THAT IT?

MAYBE IF I DID
A BETTER JOB,

I COULD'VE
CHANGED GOD'S MIND

AND CATHY
WOULDN'T HAVE DIED

FROM AN INOPERABLE
BRAIN TUMOR?

IS THAT IT?

  MICHAEL, I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,
     AND I DON'T BLAME YOU,

BUT YOU CAN'T ASSIGN HUMAN LOGIC
       TO DIVINE MATTERS.

  "DIVINE MATTERS"?

           DO YOU KNOW

             AT MATT'S FUNERAL.

                AND SHE INVITED
                US OVER.

  WE COULD'VE
  BEEN FRIENDS.

                  YES?

       ARE YOU GINA KELL?

  YES.

      YOU'RE MICHAEL SPEHN.

          I'M SO SORRY

FOR YOUR LOSS.

      THANK YOU FOR COMING.

          CAN WE SPEAK
       AFTER THE SERVICE?

              FOR JUST A MOMENT?

           OF COURSE.

                      THANK YOU.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         SO, YOU'RE FARTHER
         ALONG IN THIS PROCESS.

                CAN I ASK ABOUT
                YOUR KIDS?

             HOW THEY'RE DOING?

              YOU CAN LIE TO ME.

THEY'RE GRIEVING.

THEY JUST MISS
THEIR DAD, BUT...

THEY REALLY ARE OKAY.

               CATHY HAD TALKED
               ABOUT MATT.

            I HAVE TO
            TELL YOU SOMETHING.

                         UM...

  THE DAY BEFORE CATHY PASSED,
             SHE...

            SHE SAID,
   "MICHAEL, CALL GINA KELL."

              WHAT?

             SHE WAS VERY WEAK,

       BUT SHE WAS ADAMANT
            ABOUT IT.

SHE WANTED ME TO TEACH YOUR BOYS
     HOW TO PLAY BASKETBALL.

            I-I COACH
      AT STONEY CREEK HIGH.

      [QUIET LAUGH]

  THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

    THAT'S THE KIND OF WOMAN
          THAT SHE WAS.

      IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL
    PICTURE OF HER IN THERE.

        DID YOU TAKE IT?

              YEAH. YEAH, I DID.

     IT'S, UH, MULLET LAKE.

       UM, CATHY'S PARENTS
    HAVE A COTTAGE UP THERE.

            IT'S FROM
      A COUPLE SUMMERS AGO.

   IT WAS HER FAVORITE PLACE.

        I KNOW IT DOESN'T
 FEEL LIKE IT RIGHT NOW, BUT...

       IT DOES GET EASIER.

   YOU KNOW, I-I SAT WITH HER,
        AFTER SHE PASSED,

           AND, UH...

          I DON'T KNOW,

 I-I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO HER
      AND-AND SAY GOODBYE.

      I DID THE SAME THING.

       BUT SHE-- SHE, UH,
        SHE WASN'T THERE.

            YOU KNOW?

      YOU'RE REALLY BLESSED
    TO HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS.

          SOME OF THEM,

               IT'S NO PROBLEM.

               MICHAEL, I THINK
               IT'S TIME

                TO TALK ABOUT--

WHAT? THIS IS AGAIN?

                   YOU HAVE TO--

         [OVERLAPPING]:
         ...MAKE PLANS.

   YES, YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

         JUST LISTEN TO HIM
         FOR A MINUTE, MICHAEL.

   [MICHAEL SIGHS RELUCTANTLY]

IT'S BEEN A COUPLE
OF MONTHS NOW,

AND AS THE PEOPLE

          WHO LOVE YOU
       MOST IN THIS WORLD,

      WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
          WHAT'S NEXT.

        DESSERT IS NEXT.

PUTTING THE KIDS TO BED IS NEXT.

      AND YOU WANT TO KNOW

        WHAT I'M GONNA DO
    FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS?

           I'M SORRY,
        BUT I DON'T KNOW.

        HAVE YOU THOUGHT
      ABOUT OUR SUGGESTION?

               MOVING TO CHICAGO

       AND BUYING A HOUSE
         WITH MY SISTER

       TO RAISE OUR KIDS?

                IT MAKES
                A LOT OF SENSE!

               NO.

              I LOVE MY SISTER,
              BUT NO.

          I DON'T KNOW
     WHAT I'M GONNA DO NEXT,

         BUT I KNOW WHAT
     I AM NOT GOING TO DO--

      I AM NOT GONNA CHANGE
  ANYTHING ELSE FOR THOSE KIDS.

       I'M NOT TAKING THEM
       OUT OF THEIR HOME!

                    [GENTLY]:
                    OKAY. OKAY.

            WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

          I'LL COME BY
         IN THE MORNING

          AND GET THEM
         OFF TO SCHOOL,

     AND PICK THEM UP AFTER,

               AND IF YOU LIKE,

                  LARRY AND I
                  COULD MOVE IN

               FOR A LITTLE BIT
               WITH YOU.

WE SURE COULD!

               NO.

           THANK YOU.

       THANK YOU, BUT NO.

      WE'RE JUST TRYING TO
     FIT INTO OUR NEW ROLES.

             [SIGHS]
    WE DON'T HAVE NEW ROLES.

  WE ALL HAVE THE SAME ROLES...

   JUST ONE OF US IS MISSING.

           EXCUSE ME.

              HEY!

                 CAN I GIVE YOU
                 A HAND?

          I CAN'T LOOK
     AT THIS COOLER ANYMORE.

 THIS THING'S LIKE A DEATH FLAG.

               WELL, CAN I, UH,
               CALL SOMEONE

             TO COME PICK
             ALL THIS STUFF UP?

             THANKS.

             LOOK, I APPRECIATE
             ALL THE HELP,

            BUT THINGS ARE
            UNDER CONTROL HERE.

ARE YOU SURE?
I'VE SEEN YOU COOK.

           I'LL LEARN.

               [CHILDREN
               TALKING QUIETLY]

              YEAH.

              OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

                          DADDY?

WHAT'S GOING ON?

     WELL! I MEAN, THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING IN THE CONSEQUENCES.

        [SNAPS CONTRACT]

       WHAT MADE YOU GUYS
      DECIDE TO WRITE THIS?

               JACLYN'S PARENTS
               GOT A DIVORCE

           AND HER DAD
           MARRIED MRS. BINKOW.

            THE LADY
     WHO LIVES WITH 75 CATS?

             IT'S ACTUALLY FOUR.

OH, REALLY?

    I WILL SIGN THIS, BUT...

    I'M GONNA HAVE MY LAWYER
    TAKE A LOOK AT IT FIRST.

      [DRAWER RUMBLES OPEN
        AND THUMPS SHUT]

           GOOD? GOOD.
  ALRIGHT, COME ON. LET'S EAT.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

OH. I FORGOT
MY BACKPACK.

         YEAH. I GOT IT.
            I GOT IT.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          [BELL RINGS]

             I WAS THINKING
             THAT WE COULD JUST

           GET RID OF
           ALL OF THIS CLUTTER,

       AND LINE THIS WALL
       HERE WITH BENCHES,

          SO PEOPLE CAN
          SIT AND TALK.

I THINK WE SHOULD
GET STARBUCKS

TO COME IN
AND OPEN UP A BRANCH.

PEOPLE COULD HAVE COFFEE,

BROWSE THROUGH MAGAZINES.

            STARBUCKS IN CHURCH?

YOU GOT
A BETTER PLAN?

              WELL, ANYTHING
              IS A BETTER PLAN.

              I MEAN, ARSON
              IS A BETTER PLAN.

           LOOK AT THIS CARPET!
           THIS IS DISGUSTING.

   I THINK WE START RIGHT HERE
      AND GET RID OF THIS.

             -EW...
              -HEY!

                WHAT'S GOING ON?

       WH-- OH! HELLO. HI.

WE'RE JUST, UH, ACTUALLY
REDOING THE ATRIUM.

WE FINALLY HAVE
A BUDGET NOW

AND A COMMITTEE,

SO WE JUST
NEED A PLAN.

        I WANT TO MAKE IT
        A COFFEE LOUNGE.

            GINA HERE
    WANTS TO SET IT ON FIRE.

       [MICHAEL SNICKERS]

                  LADIES.
                  HEY, MICHAEL.

                PASTOR.

I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN
TAKING A COURSE

OVER AT THE COLLEGE,
IN, UH, DESIGN?

               UH, YEAH, I MEAN,

            IT'S JUST SOMETHING
            I CAN TAKE ONLINE.

             ALWAYS KIND OF HAD
             AN INTEREST, SO...

         [PASTOR KARL]:
          THAT'S GREAT.

                   I SHOULD
                   PROBABLY GO.

I MEAN, YOU'RE FROM
CHICAGO, THOUGH, RIGHT?

                YEAH. WEST SIDE.

        I'M A SOUTHSIDER.
   CUBBIES FAN MY WHOLE LIFE.

                       I'M FINE.

                      THANK YOU.

                   POOR MICHAEL.

                     YOU SHOULD
                     CALL HIM.

    AND SAY WHAT?

I DON'T KNOW.
TAKE HIM FOR A COFFEE?

IT'S GOOD TO
TALK TO SOMEONE

       WHO'S GOING THROUGH
       THE SAME THINGS YOU ARE.

            THAT'S WHY I JOINED
            WEIGHT WATCHERS.

         FUNNY.

IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

   [RADIO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND]

        OW! OW-OW-OW-OW!

YOU CAN'T
TOAST THE BREAD.

IT'LL BE GROSS BY LUNCH.

BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE
ONE BROWN SOCK

AND ONE BLACK SOCK ON.

              YEAH.

       I KNOW. NEW STYLE.

        MOM BUYS THE SOFT BREAD
        AND SHE CUTS OFF

          THE OUTSIDE.

          NO, IT WON'T!

          YES, IT WILL!

          NO, IT WON'T!

        OKAY, NO YELLING!

       OH, JACK, COME ON.
     YOU GOTTA GET DRESSED.

         WE GOTTA LEAVE
        IN A FEW MINUTES.

  I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

       OKAY, LOOK. I DON'T
 HAVE TIME FOR THAT TODAY, GUYS.

  I'VE GOT A MEETING IN AN HOUR
      AND I CAN'T BE LATE.

I HAVE TO BRING

COOKIES TO SCHOOL
TODAY FOR OUR PARTY.

           WHAT? AGH!

     YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME!

       I DID! THREE TIMES!

       LOOK AT THE FRIDGE.

       [GROANING QUIETLY]

        OKAY, OKAY. UM...

       HERE. THERE WE GO.

                        PERFECT.

         ALRIGHT, THERE YOU GO.
         YOU'RE ALL SET.

    THESE ARE CRACKERS!

MOMMY ALWAYS
BAKED COOKIES

WHEN IT WAS MY TURN
TO BRING THEM.

I'M NOT GOING!

         YOU RUINED IT!

           [MICHAEL]:
   HE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE!

    YES, HE DID! IT'S RUINED!
      HE DID IT ON PURPOSE!

           I DID NOT!

      JACK! GO GET DRESSED!

           EVERYBODY,
 WE'RE LEAVING IN FIVE MINUTES.

           I WANT MOMMY!

DON'T BE STUPID!

SHE'S DEAD
AND SHE'S NOT COMING BACK!

               CHARLOTTE, DON'T!

          I WANT MOMMY!

I WANT MOMMY!

          -IT'S OKAY--
       -DAD! DO SOMETHING!

          -OKAY, JUST--
         -I WANT MOMMY!

       -NO! I WANT MOMMY!

                 I KNOW, I KNOW.

         WHAT DO YOU NEED? HEY.

         -WHAT DO YOU--
            -I WANT--

       -SHH. SHH. I KNOW.
           -...MOMMY!

       -I KNOW. SHH, SHH.
      -[SOBS] I WANT MOMMY.

I WANT MOMMY.
I WANT MOMMY.

          IT'S OKAY.
          IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

I WANT MOMMY.

                     IT'S OKAY,
                     IT'S OKAY.

          HEY, MICHAEL!

          DANNY DOESN'T
          HAVE A LUNCH.

AH, NO WORRIES!

WE ALWAYS HAVE EXTRA
FOR KIDS WHO FORGET.

          DIDN'T FORGET.
          I JUST MADE IT WRONG.

      I'M LATE. I'M SORRY.

       [ENGINE SHUTS OFF]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

            I FAILED.

             HOW SO?

  CATHY, SHE GOT SICK SO FAST.

    THE CANCER JUST STOLE HER
   AWAY FROM ME, AND I JUST...

       I COULDN'T STOP IT.

             THEY WOULD JUST BE
             SO MUCH BETTER OFF

               IF SHE WERE HERE
               AND I--

        HEY. SHE WOULD BE
  SAYING EXACTLY THE SAME THING

     IF SHE WAS SITTING HERE
       AND YOU WERE GONE.

       I SAW A VIDEO ONCE

   OF THE WAVES COMING ASHORE

       DURING THE TSUNAMI
      IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.

     PEOPLE WERE JUST DOING
   REGULAR, ORDINARY THING..

  AND THIS GIANT WALL OF WATER
        CAME CRASHING IN,

         JUST DESTROYING
     EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

  AND THERE WAS NO STOPPING IT.

            THAT'S...
     [TAKES A SHAKY BREATH]

     THAT'S JUST HOW I FEEL.

MICHAEL, THERE WAS
NOTHING YOU COULD DO.

YOU COULDN'T STOP WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY,

BUT YOU CAN CONTROL
WHAT YOU DO NEXT.

    YOU CAN GATHER YOUR KIDS
           AROUND YOU

      AND YOU CAN LOVE 'EM,

     AND YOU CAN GUIDE THEM
      OUT OF THE DARKNESS.

      BUT HOW DO I DO THAT?

YOU STAY CONNECTED.

IT'S REAL COMMON
FOR MEN

TO HUNKER DOWN
AND GO IT ALONE,

  ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HIGH TIDE
    OF GRIEF STARTS TO RISE.

    BUT IF YOU STAY CONNECTED
         TO YOUR FAMILY

AND THIS COMMUNITY,

YOU'RE GONNA
FIND YOUR WAY.

         I'VE GOT TO GO.

ALRIGHT.

        [MICHAEL SNIFFLES
       AND STARTS ENGINE]

ET CHATTER
           AND BUSTLE]

    MICHAEL? HEY!

      [MUFFLED]: GINA! HEY!

   HEY. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

YEAH! YOU TOO.

          OH, I CAN SEE
 THAT YOU GOT YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW

   TO STOP DOING YOUR LAUNDRY.

     YES! THEY FINALLY LEFT.

   WAIT. HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

WELL...

           JUDGING BY
  THE PINK TINT TO YOUR SHIRT,

YOU'RE EITHER DOING
A WALK FOR THE CURE LATER,

  OR YOU'VE BEEN MIXING WHITES
           WITH REDS.

                 HUH.

   WELL, TRUTH IS, I'D RATHER
      DO THESE THINGS WRONG

   THAN HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
        HOVERING OVER ME.

          MM. I GET IT.

             I GOT THIS NEIGHBOR

 AND SHE WANTED TO BRING DINNER
          OVER FOR US.

           I SAID NO,
          SHE INSISTED.

         SO I RACED HOME
    FROM BASKETBALL PRACTICE,

    YOU KNOW, WITH THE KIDS,

       AND THERE'S A PIZZA
     SITTING ON MY DOORSTEP.

    I CAN ORDER MY OWN PIZZA.

     THAT'S TRUE.

         I KNOW, BUT WHY
     WOULD SOMEONE DO THAT?

         IT'S INSULTING.

   YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S LIKE...

  IT'S LIKE SHE THINKS I CAN'T
EVEN TAKE CARE OF MY OWN FAMILY.

  I DON'T THINK SHE MEANT THAT.

                   I DON'T KNOW.

       IT'S LIKE LIFE JUST
 KEEPS THROWING ME CURVE BALLS.

 I DON'T NEED TO HIT A HOME RUN,

       JUST A DECENT PITCH
      WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

       THEN TAKE THE WALK.

        I'M SORRY, WHAT?

STOP SWINGING AT
ALL THIS JUNK.

             IGNORE
   SOME OF THESE CURVE BALLS,

     AND JUST TAKE THE WALK.

      MAKE IT TO FIRST BASE

AND JUST SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.

    NOBODY TAKES MY METAPHOR
 AND JUST THROWS IT BACK ON ME.

    [GINA LAUGHS]

OH... HERE WE GO.

DID YOUR KIDS
PUT THIS ON THE LIST?

THEY SAID IT WAS
THE "HEALTHY" KIND?

               MAYBE.

IT'S ALRIGHT.
IT WAS A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

                    I THINK SO.

[INHALES ABRUPTLY]
UM...

OH! THERE'S
THIS OTHER WOMAN,

WHO LEAVES US A CAKE
EVERY WEEK,

     AND SHE'S IN THE CHOIR,

          BUT SHE'S GOT
 THIS REALLY WEIRD, AWFUL VOICE,

 AND THEY KEEP GIVING HER SOLOS,
        AND SHE'S JUST...

         I KNOW EXACTLY
    WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

         -IT'S AWKWARD.
             -VERY.

               WHAT SHOULD I DO?

              UH...

               WHY DON'T
               I CUT THE BREAD?

            DO YOU HAVE A KNIFE?

YEAH. NO, NO.
I'LL-- I'LL-- UM...

         -GRAB A KNIFE?
          -THAT DRAWER.

             -I'LL--
             -OKAY.

               ...GET INTO THIS.


ALRIGHT, CHAR,
YOU SIT HERE.

BOYS, GRAB A SEAT
WHEREVER YOU WOULD LIKE.

THANKS, PAL.

     [AWKWARD SILENCE FALLS]

   [QUIETLY REALIZING]: OH...

      [MICHAEL]: IT'S OKAY.

    SO, DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY
 OUR FAMILIES ARE HAVING DINNER

        TOGETHER TONIGHT?

       WELL, IT'S BECAUSE

         WE'RE ALL GOING
     THROUGH THE SAME THING,

             AND...

   WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE
      GOOD TO GET TOGETHER

 AND TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER, TALK
  AND JUST SHARE OUR FEELINGS.

        [CHARLOTTE BURPS]

         [ALL CHUCKLING]

     [CHARLOTTE]: EXCUSE ME.

           [LAUGHTER]

        WOULD ANYONE ELSE
  LIKE TO SHARE THEIR FEELINGS?

           [LAUGHING]

AND ON
THAT NOTE, OKAY!

             DIG IN!

  [KIDS LAUGHING AND CHATTING]

YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

WE DON'T MAKE GUESTS
CLEAN UP DISHES AT THE HOUSE.

          AFTER THE DINNER
          WE JUST WENT THROUGH,

           WE ARE HARDLY GUESTS
           AT THIS POINT.

              -DAD!
             -YEAH?

CAN WE PLAY
"BALL OF PERIL"?

           OH. UH, IT'S
           A SPEHN FAMILY GAME.

            UH... NOT NOW, GUYS.

      WE HAVE GUESTS, OKAY?

MAYBE IN A BIT.

NO! NO, DON'T
LET US STOP YOU.

           UH... WELL,
       BUT THE THING IS--

                     OH, HO, HO!

                           WHOA!

      IF YOU FEEL THE BALL,
        YOU MUST FREEZE!

          RUN FROM ME!

            -[ROARS]
        -[KIDS LAUGHING]

   [ALL LAUGHING AND SHOUTING]

              -AH!
           -OOH, OOH!

DON'T EVEN TRY
TO UNDERSTAND.

              BOYS.

   YEAH!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

                   DON'T TACKLE!

               OH!

   [MICHAEL ROARING VICIOUSLY]

              AHH!

     [ROARING AND LAUGHTER]

IT JUST GOT
OUT OF CONTROL

BEFORE I KNEW
WHAT HAPPENED.

IT'S ACTUALLY TAKEN ON
A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

               YOU NEED TO JUST
               THINK POSITIVELY

         AND DECIDE THAT
         YOU CAN OVERCOME THIS.

             YOU'LL BE STRONGER
             IN THE END

              FOR HAVING TRIED.

             [INHALES SHARPLY]:
             OH...

MM-HMM.

WELL, THIS IS--
UH,<i> WAS...</i>

CHARLOTTE'S
FAVORITE DRESS.

I'LL TELL YA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING WRONG.

I MEAN, IT'S NOT
MY FIRST RODEO.

I DID MY OWN LAUNDRY
IN COLLEGE.

                WELL, YEAH,
                BUT IN COLLEGE,

             YOU PROBABLY HAD
             JEANS AND T-SHIRTS

               AND SWEATSHIRTS.

                 NOW YOU HAVE
                 A LITTLE GIRL,

              WHO HAS
              A WOOL-KNIT DRESS

      THAT SHOULD BE
      HAND-WASHED IN COLD WATER

               AND HUNG TO DRY.

        MM-HMM.

       MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
      LET MY MOTHER-IN-LAW

       KEEP DOING MY WASH.

             WHAT? WHERE IS
             YOUR DIGNITY, MAN?

               YOU CAN DO THIS!
               COME ON!

               I'M GOING TO
               GET YOU STARTED.

NO, LOOK, I CAN'T
ASK YOU TO HELP.

            NO, NO.
            THIS ISN'T CHARITY.

          THIS IS<i> QUID PRO QUO.</i>

OH, REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

          [HOARSE, DEEP VOICE]:
          SOME DAY...

              AND THAT DAY
              MAY NEVER COME...

            I MAY ASK YOU TO DO
            A SERVICE FOR ME.

[AS MARLON BRANDO]:
UNTIL THAT DAY,

ACCEPT THIS JUSTICE

AS A GIFT ON
MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING DAY.

   <i> THE GODFATHER!</i>

           -GODFATHER!
             -NICE!

                  [LAUGHING]
                  VERY GOOD.

                    BYE! THANKS!

              -BYE!
            -SEE YOU.

              -BYE!
    -THANKS FOR COMING, GUYS.

             [GINA]:
      THANKS FOR HAVING US.

        OH!

I WANTED TO GIVE
YOU GUYS THESE.

IT'S A BOOK WHERE YOU CAN
PUT PICTURES AND... MEMORIES.

REALLY,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

MY BOYS MADE ONE
FOR THEIR DAD.

              COOL!

      DID YOU KNOW MY MOM?

           I MET HER.

       SHE WAS SO PRETTY.

     YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HER.

       [CHARLOTTE LAUGHS]

ALRIGHT, WELL,
GOOD NIGHT.

           GOOD NIGHT.

                         THANKS.

THANKS
FOR THE BOOKS!

         YOU'RE WELCOME.

                    HERE YOU GO.

             THANKS.

     THANK YOU FOR TONIGHT.

           THANK YOU.

      IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE MY KIDS LAUGHED LIKE THIS.

       MM. YEAH. MINE TOO.

    DRIVE SAFELY. BYE, GUYS!

           -TAKE CARE.
              -BYE!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          [CAR STARTS]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

                   BYE! SEE YOU
                   AT SCHOOL!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          WELL, HEY, CHARLOTTE,
          HOW ARE YOU?

  I'M GOOD.

           WHAT'S UP?

UM, I WAS WONDERING

IF YOU COULD HELP ME
WITH SOMETHING.

                   WELL, I SURE
                   HOPE SO!

I THINK I NEED A BRA,

BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHAT SIZE.

    I CAN ABSOLUTELY HELP YOU
     WITH THAT, SWEETHEART.

           COME HERE.

              YEAH.

  WE CAN GO SHOPPING TOGETHER,
       IF YOU WANT, OKAY?

                WHAT ARE YOU
                DOING UP THERE?

       HEY! I'M MEASURING
       FOR THE NEW PLANS.

             SO YOU AND COLLEEN
             HAVE A NEW PLAN?

         WELL, MM, YEAH,

 THE PASTOR DIDN'T EXACTLY LOVE
   OUR FIRST FEW SUGGESTIONS.

                 I'M KIND OF
                 NOT SURPRISED.

              YEAH.

   THE CHALLENGE IS COMING UP
       WITH, UH, A THEME.

                     WELL, UH...

   WHAT ABOUT MAKING THE SPACE
     SOMEWHERE TO CELEBRATE

   ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP IT
       RELEVANT AND ALIVE?

AH! NOW, THAT'S A PLAN.
I LOVE IT.

             ME TOO.

       HEY, MAYBE MICHAEL
    COULD HELP US DESIGN IT.

        OH... UM, MAYBE.

  SURE. YEAH. I'M SURE I COULD
   PULL A FEW IDEAS TOGETHER.

    PERFECT.

          HEY, LISTEN,
        THANK YOU SO MUCH

      FOR HELPING CHARLOTTE
    WITH HER, UH, SITUATION.

APPARENTLY,
THERE ARE SOME THINGS

THAT A MAN CAN'T DO.

   YEAH. THAT WAS MY PLEASURE.

         DO YOU REMEMBER
 THE<i> QUID PRO QUO</i> WE DISCUSSED?

      I DO.

     [AS BRANDO]: "THE THING
        THAT YOU MAY ASK

        MAY NEVER COME."

         [BOTH LAUGHING]

      BUT YOU DON'T WANT ME
    TO WHACK SOMEONE, DO YOU?

        [INHALES SHARPLY]

    NOT GONNA BE THAT SIMPLE.

       I MEAN, IT DID SAY
    "SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED."

                WOW! UH... YEAH.

                   SOME ASSEMBLY

        AND A DEGREE IN
        MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.

MATT WAS REALLY GOOD
AT THIS KIND OF THING.

               YEAH. WELL, LOOK.

                  I'M WILLING
                  TO TACKLE IT,

             BUT I'M GONNA NEED
             SOME ASSISTANCE.

                 DO YOU KNOW
                 ANY STRONG MEN

                WILLING TO WORK
                LONG HOURS

             FOR LITERALLY
             NO PAY WHATSOEVER?

           HMM... OH!

            NEVER GONNA MAKE IT
            IN THE UNION!

LET'S DO THIS.

       ALRIGHT, HAVE FUN!

                    OKAY, GREAT.

       [WHISPERS]: WHAT IS THIS?

    -[BOYS]: IT'S A BUNKBED!
             -WHAT?

                   ALRIGHT,
                   HELP ME OUT.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       ALRIGHT, NOW,<i> THIS</i>
    IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

        THIS INFORMATION
  MAY SOMEDAY SAVE YOUR LIVES.

 "RIGHTY-TIGHTY, LEFTY-LOOSEY."

            COME ON.
         SAY IT WITH ME.

   [TOGETHER]: RIGHTY-TIGHTY,
          LEFTY-LOOSEY!

     [MICHAEL]: YES, MY MEN!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

    OKAY, YOU GUYS, TONIGHT,

     WE'RE GONNA START BUBBA
        IN THE ONE SPOT,

         "D" IN THE TWO,
  CHOPPER, YOU'RE IN THE THREE.

     BOOTS, YOU IN THE FOUR,
AND CHARLIE, YOU'RE IN THE FIVE.

          OFFENSIVELY,
        WE ARE IN THE 41,

     I WANT TO SEE A LOT OF
    POST-TOUCHES AND X-CUTS.

          DEFENSIVELY,
   WE'RE GONNA COUGAR ALL DAY.

            -GOT IT?
        -[KIDS]: YES! GO!

       ALRIGHT, ON THREE!

   [ALL]: ONE... TWO... THREE!

             -WHOO!

    [ALL CHATTERING HAPPILY]

         [GINA LAUGHING]

HE IS JUST SO GREAT
WITH THE KIDS.

              I KNOW, RIGHT?

DID YOU KNOW THAT MATT
PLAYED BASKETBALL

FOR CATHY'S DAD?

                REALLY?

OVER HERE!

              HO!

          IT'S SO GOOD

          FOR YOUR KIDS TO HAVE
          A MALE FIGURE AROUND.

WE ARE JUST FRIENDS.

OUR FAMILIES JUST NEED
EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW.

THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

          I DIDN'T
          SAY ANYTHING.

GOOD! BECAUSE
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING
THE SUMMER IN COLORADO

AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

NOT EVEN GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER

FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
AFTER THAT, WHO KNOWS?

SHOOT! SHOOT! SHOOT!

          OH! SO CLOSE!

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       [GINA]:<i> IT WAS GOOD</i>
          <i> FOR THE BOYS</i>

     <i> TO GET AWAY FROM HOME</i>
 <i> AND SEE LIFE FROM A DISTANCE.</i>

          <i> THE OUTDOORS</i>
       <i> AND THE QUIET TIME</i>

      <i> GAVE ME TIME TO FIND</i>
       <i> A SENSE OF PEACE.</i>

         COME ON, GUYS.

               I REALLY WANT TO
               GO PLAY HOCKEY.

        [EXHAUSTED SIGH]
      OH, HOME, SWEET HOME.

         [SIGHS WEARILY]

       I AM SO EXHAUSTED.

     ARE WE GOING SHOPPING?

NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

       WE'LL GO TOMORROW.

    WE STILL HAVE A FEW DAYS
      BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS.

          [PHONE RINGS
       AND GINA WHIMPERS]

            [RINGING]

             [BEEP]

             HELLO?

        OH, HI, MICHAEL.

     YEAH, NO, WE LITERALLY
  JUST WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR.

              -YES!
          -YES. PLEASE?

THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

NO, NO,
WE'RE NOT TIRED.

          [BOYS]: YES!

         [KIDS CHATTING]

DID YOU ORDER YOUR KIDS
NEW SCHOOL UNIFORMS YET?

   WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?
              OHH!

     CHARLOTTE PROBABLY GREW
    THREE INCHES THIS SUMMER

      AND DANNY'S AT LEAST
         ONE SIZE BIGGER

 AND JACK'S SHOES ARE TOO SMALL.

          HOW COULD YOU
       POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

      AH, IT'S A MOM THING.

           CATHY KNEW.

          YES, SHE DID.

      [CHURCH BELL TOLLING]

          GOOD MORNING.

       HEY! GOOD MORNING!

          GOOD MORNING.

  AH, GENTLEMEN, GOOD MORNING.

             -HELLO.
         -GOOD MORNING.

                   GOOD MORNING.

       GOOD MORNING, GINA.

         AH, THE SPEHNS!

         -GOOD MORNING.
      -SAM! DREW! WAIT UP!

   -HI, PASTOR. HOW'S THINGS?
     -REALLY WELL. YOURSELF?

      -I'M GOOD. THANK YOU.
           -EXCELLENT.

       THIS IS A SURPRISE.

          IT FEELS GOOD TO BE
          BACK IN CHURCH TODAY.

              I GUESS WE'RE
              SITTING TOGETHER?

I GUESS SO!

       GO ON. GO, GO, GO.

     -LET'S PLAY VOLLEYBALL!
             -OKAY.

   HERE YOU GO.

                         THANKS.

           THAT'S MATT
   AND HIS THREE BEST FRIENDS.

     THEY GREW UP TOGETHER.

  THEY PUT ON A GOLF TOURNAMENT

   TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY
    IN MATT'S NAME LAST YEAR.

THEY'RE GONNA DO IT
AGAIN THIS YEAR.

          THAT'S GREAT.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

      THIS IS A VIDEO DIARY
    THAT MATT MADE OF HIMSELF

          FOR THE BOYS,

      LESSONS THAT A FATHER
  WOULD WANT TO TEACH HIS SONS.

              WOW.

     HAVE YOU WATCHED THEM?

        I STARTED, BUT...

       I JUST CAN'T REALLY
         FINISH IT YET.

     [HEATED VOICES OUTSIDE]

        I-I BETTER GO SEE
        WHAT'S GOING ON.

                           WAIT.

                 JUST GIVE THEM
                 A MINUTE.

   I JUST WANT THEM
   TO PLAY FAIR.

                       TRUST ME.

THEY PLAY
IN THE BACKYARD,

BUT IT'S ALSO
WHERE THEY LEARN

TO NEGOTIATE
AND COMPROMISE.

           YOU GUYS--

   [SHOUTING OVER EACH OTHER]

DON'T DENY THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY

TO WORK IT OUT
THEMSELVES.

         JUST TRUST ME.

THE BACKYARD CAN BE
A MAGICAL PLACE.

WHO CARES?

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           HOW DID YOU
           KNOW THAT?

IT'S A DAD THING.

I'M SURE
MATT KNEW IT, TOO.

                YOU'RE RIGHT.

                HE DID.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

     [KIDS]: TRICK-OR-TREAT!

CATHY LOVED HALLOWEEN.

    [GINA]: MATT WAS TOO SICK

     TO GO TRICK-OR-TREATING
         LAST HALLOWEEN,

        SO WE STAYED HOME
    AND JUST GAVE OUT CANDY.

         I CAN'T BELIEVE
     THAT WAS 10 MONTHS AGO.

       SOMETIMES, IT SEEMS
         LIKE YESTERDAY,

         AND, SOMETIMES,
     IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER.

       YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

         AND I MUST SAY,
   I REALLY LIKE YOUR COSTUME.

                  OH! THANK YOU.

                    THE BOYS
                    DRESSED ME.

            -MM-HMM!
       -I'M A LINEBACKER.

YEAH, VERY CONVINCING.

AND BY CONVINCING,

I MEAN YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING LIKE A LINEBACKER.

     WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
     I LOOK GOOD!

                I WORE THIS
                TO TARGET TODAY

           AND I GOT ASKED OUT
           BY A TOTAL STRANGER.

           WHO WAS IT?

    [HISSES]: I'LL KILL HIM!

               [LAUGHS]
               ARE YOU JEALOUS?

     YES!

  I GO TO TARGET ALL THE TIME,
       NOBODY ASKS ME OUT.

                      [LAUGHING]

     IF I SAW YOU AT TARGET,
 I'D PROBABLY ASK YOU OUT, TOO.

             ARE YOU FLIRTING
             WITH A LINEBACKER?

        YES.

AND IF YOU SAID YES,

I WOULD PROBABLY TAKE YOU
TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

                     OH, REALLY?

LISTEN, JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE ITALIAN

DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

THAT KNOWS
GOOD ITALIAN FOOD.

                CHUCK E. CHEESE?

HO-HO-HO!

LUIGI'S.

WE SHOULD GO THERE
FOR DINNER.

YOU CAN JUDGE
FOR YOURSELF.

         ALRIGHT, I'LL TAKE YOU
         UP ON THAT OFFER.

             GREAT!
    I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 7:30.

     ALRIGHT, COME ON, GUYS!
           LAST HOUSE!

   -WAIT FOR ME, WAIT FOR ME.
      -WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

               [GINA]:
               IT'S NOT A DATE.


               IT'S JUST DINNER.

             MORE OF A BET
             OR A DARE, REALLY.

I TOTALLY AGREE.

             I MEAN, IT'S NOT
             ABOUT DRESSING UP.

       IT'S JUST I DON'T
       HAVE ANYTHING THAT FITS.

        I HAVE NOT BOUGHT
    NEW CLOTHES IN TWO YEARS.

             [GASPS] YOU SHOULD
             BUY SOMETHING NEW!

            I SHOULD!

  BUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A DATE,
      BECAUSE IT'S SO NOT.

                    I COULDN'T
                    AGREE MORE.

                   OR LESS.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         I MEAN, IT'S IMPORTANT
         TO DO SOMETHING NICE

               FOR YOURSELF
               ONCE IN A WHILE.

THIS IS JUST
GOOD GROOMING.

IT'S A MATTER OF HYGIENE.
NOTHING SPECIAL.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          OH! NO.
          NOT MY COLOR.

 I AGREE.

             OR IS IT?

UM... HMM.
I AGREE.

            NO. DEFINITELY NOT.

            TRYING TOO HARD?

I DON'T THINK SO.
I LIKE IT!

           NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.
           TRYING WAY TOO HARD.

             TOO YOUNG?
             TOO OLD?

  OH, NO. I--

           YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.

   THAT'S IT.

            I AGREE.

         YOU KNOW WHAT?
 IT'S A NICE LOOK FOR GOING OUT

       FOR DINNER AT NIGHT

          WITH A FRIEND
   THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT.

                           YEAH!

         [ANXIOUS SIGH]

    THIS IS A DATE, ISN'T IT?

       YES.

     I AM A 36-YEAR-OLD MOM
  GOING OUT ON HER FIRST DATE.

       THE FIRST DATE THAT
   I HAVE BEEN ON IN 15 YEARS.

          THE LAST TIME
      I WENT OUT ON A DATE,

         MEN WERE BOYS.

     THEY STILL ARE!

       JUST BREATHE, GINA.

      SUCK IN THE OXYGEN...

     [BOTH INHALING DEEPLY]

JUST LET IT OUT.
JUST BREATHE.

       OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

           THIS IS...

          YEAH, I THINK
       I'M GOING TO FAINT.

                    REALLY GOOD.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

FEELS WEIRD TO BE OUT
WITHOUT THE CHILDREN.

      OH, WE COULD SEE IF
      THEY HAVE ANY IN THE BACK

             THEY COULD LOAN US.

           THANK YOU.

       [QUIET MUSIC PLAYS

HELLO. MY NAME
IS SARAH

AND I'LL BE
YOUR SERVER TONIGHT.

           HEY, SARAH.
          HOW ARE YOU?

             I'M GREAT, THANKS.
             HOW ARE YOU?

    WE ARE WEAK FROM HUNGER.

  I MEAN, I CAN BARELY MAKE OUT
     THE WORDS ON THE MENU.

HOW ABOUT
SOME WARM BREAD, THEN?

      THAT WOULD BE GREAT,
             THANKS.

              WHAT?

       OH, YOU WERE SWEET
        TO THE WAITRESS.

             AND...?

          I LIKE THAT.

OH.

         OKAY.

             I MEAN, THINGS LIKE

    BEING NICE TO A WAITRESS
        GIVES YOU POINTS.

   IT'S LIKE THE RIGHT SHOES.

 YOU KNOW, YOU WEAR RIGHT SHOES,
         YOU GET POINTS.

    YOU WEAR THE WRONG SHOES

                COULD BE
                A DEAL-BREAKER.

            OR-OR-OR DIRT UNDER
            YOUR FINGERNAILS.

                       OR HAIR.

             -HAIR?
           -OH, YEAH!

      TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING
          IS JUST BAD.

  YOU KNOW, TOO MUCH HAIR GEL,
      TOO MUCH BLOW-DRYING,

               TOO MUCH
               OF A COMB-OVER--

         HOW AM I DOIN'?

      UH, SO FAR, SO GOOD.

            OH, WHEW!

            YEAH. I MEAN,
            WE WILL HAVE TO SEE

              HOW YOU DO WITH
              THE DESSERT TRAY.

       WAIT. I HAVE TO DO
          DESSERT, TOO?

          -OH, TOTALLY!
              -OH!

        ORDERING DESSERT,
   EVEN IF THE WOMAN SAYS NO,

             IS KEY.

          NOW, LISTEN,
    I'M ONLY TELLING YOU THIS

   BECAUSE I TRUST YOU'RE NOT
  GONNA ABUSE THE INFORMATION.

            [LAUGHS]

      GREAT.

   WE'RE READY
   TO ORDER.

WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING
ON THE DESSERT TRAY.

           -[LAUGHING]
        -AND THEN, ALSO--

      DO YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE
 THAT I CAN GET MY SHOES SHINED?

    BECAUSE, UM, APPARENTLY,
  IF THEY HAVE SCUFFS ON THEM,

    THIS RELATIONSHIP'S OVER.

        [AWKWARD CHUCKLE]

      WE'LL JUST HEAR ABOUT
      THE SPECIALS, PLEASE.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

              THANK YOU.
              THAT MEANS A LOT,

       COMING FROM AN AUTHENTIC
       ITALIAN PERSON.


       WELL... GOOD NIGHT.

           GOOD NIGHT.

         YOU SHOULD GO.

                    I'M LEAVING.

           YOU SHOULD.

              I AM.

IS IT GONNA BE FINISHED
IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS?

        WELL, I HOPE SO.

    I MEAN, ALL THE ARTWORK'S
     STILL AT THE PRINTERS.

YEAH, BUT WE HAVE
LESS THAN TWO MONTHS.

           I DON'T THINK
           WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

        THINK POSITIVELY!

                   I POSITIVELY
                   DON'T THINK

           WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

             [SIGHS]

         CAN SAM AND ME
           STAY OVER?

                      PLEASE?
                      CAN THEY?

        WELL, IT'S "SAM AND I."

                  I DON'T KNOW.

              I MEAN, WERE
              YOU GUYS INVITED?

                 DAD? CAN THEY?

                        PLEASE?

YEAH! OF COURSE.

RIGHT?

                   I DON'T MIND.

         -YES! AWESOME!
      -LET'S GO TO MY ROOM.

HAVING A SLEEPOVER. HMM.

          YES, IT DOES.

                        MOM?

    ARE YOU GONNA STAY, TOO?

               OH, NO, SWEETIE.

              ADULTS DON'T HAVE
              SLEEPOVERS.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             ALL ALONE
             ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

         [INHALES DEEPLY] WHAT
         WILL I DO WITH MYSELF?

    OH, YEAH, BIG SACRIFICE.

  I MIGHT NEED SOME ICE CREAM,
  A MOVIE, A NICE LONG BATH...

    IT'S GONNA BE A HARDSHIP,
       BUT I WILL SURVIVE.

            UH, WELL,
    I'D INVITE YOU TO STAY...

       NO. I WILL BE BACK
  IN THE MORNING. YOU HAVE FUN.

    WELL, I'LL MAKE PANCAKES.

             OKAY. THAT'S GREAT.

IS THIS REALLY
AS EASY AS IT SEEMS?

OR...

               [SIGHING]
               IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

  UM...

    CARE TO TEST THE WATERS?

        WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

VETERAN'S DAY
IS COMING UP.

             WE HAVE
      A THREE-DAY WEEKEND.

  WE COULD ALL GO ON VACATION.

  THE WHOLE CRAZY BUNCH OF US.

  YOU WANT TO TRAVEL SOMEWHERE
       WITH FIVE CHILDREN?

         YEAH! WHY NOT?

     IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE
         TO HAVE A SIGN.

      SOMETHING TO TELL US

          WE'RE HEADED
     IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

               MM.

     OKAY, I TELL YOU WHAT.

     YOU WRITE A LIST OF ALL
  THE REASONS THIS CAN'T WORK,

        I'LL DO THE SAME,

          AND TOMORROW,
      WE'LL EXCHANGE LISTS.

    [WOMAN]: I MEAN, I DON'T
    WANT TO BE JUDGMENTAL...

             SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

HOW WAS THE RANCH?

          OH! IT WAS JUST GREAT.

            REALLY, THE KIDS
            GOT ALONG SO GREAT.

         IT WAS JUST EFFORTLESS.

WONDERFUL, GINA.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

          THANK YOU.
          SO WHAT'S THE MATTER?

UM, PEOPLE ARE TALKING.

THEY THINK THAT THINGS
ARE MOVING TOO FAST,

THAT MAYBE
IT'S TOO SOON

FOR YOU AND MICHAEL
TO BE QUITE SO CONNECTED.

EVEN SOME OF THE KIDS
ARE MAKING COMMENTS.

                           UH...

     AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?

I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,

       BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN
          A YEAR, GINA.

    I-I JUST... TAKE IT EASY

   WITH THIS WHOLE "BLUE BIRDS
     OF HAPPINESS" ROUTINE.

YOUR KIDS NEED
ALL THE SUPPORT

THIS PLACE CAN
GIVE THEM RIGHT NOW.

     I'M-- I'M JUST SAYING.

       I REALLY APPRECIATE
          THE HEADS-UP.

 YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND, COLLEEN.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       AHH! HEY, YOU GUYS!

         [ALL CHATTING]

       COME ON, UPSTAIRS.
 YOU GOTTA GET READY FOR SCHOOL!

            COME ON!
         GO, GO, GO, GO!

THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DOING THIS.

I'VE JUST BEEN
SPREAD A LITTLE THIN,

AND I REALLY NEEDED THIS.

      COULD I TALK TO YOU
      ABOUT SOMETHING, MICHAEL?

UH, YEAH,
OF COURSE, ANYTHING.

     -SEE YOU SOON, GRANDPA!
     -THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

      THE KIDS TALKED TO US

         ABOUT GINA KELL
        AND HER CHILDREN,

    ABOUT BECOMING A FAMILY.

              WHAT ABOUT IT?

DO YOU THINK

           IT'S WISE,
   SO SOON AFTER LOSING CATHY?

        I MEAN, THE KIDS
      MIGHT NEED MORE TIME.

                 DID THE KIDS
                 SAY SOMETHING?

                 ARE THEY UPSET?

      NO, IT'S JUST THAT...

       THEY'VE HAD TO DEAL
       WITH SO MUCH CHANGE

      IN THEIR YOUNG LIVES.

DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE READY

    TO ACCEPT SOMEONE TAKING
      THEIR MOTHER'S PLACE?

          NO! GINA IS NOT
          TAKING CATHY'S PLACE.

             SHE-- NO ONE COULD
             EVER DO THAT.

LOOK, MICHAEL.

      I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
          IT IS FOR YOU

     TO RAISE THREE CHILDREN
          ON YOUR OWN,

   AND HOW LONELY YOU MUST BE,
              BUT--

   GINA'S VULNERABLE AS WELL.

I MEAN, SHE MIGHT NEED MORE TIME
  TO GET HER OWN LIFE TOGETHER.

    [JILL]: WE JUST WANT YOU
    TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT

      THAT THIS COULD HAVE
       ON ALL THE CHILDREN

  IF-- IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

      AND WHAT IF THE KIDS
      GET ATTACHED TO GINA,

  AND THEN THEY LOSE HER, TOO?

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       [DOOR BELL JINGLES]

I AM SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

               NO PROBLEM.
               GOOD TO SEE YOU.

          OH, YOU TOO.
  BETWEEN WORKING AT THE SCHOOL

  AND WE'RE REDOING THE ATRIUM,
       AND IT'S JUST BUSY.

         -IT'S ALL GOOD.
          -CRAZY BUSY!

SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

                    HAVE A SEAT.

THANKS.

OH, HEY!
TELL DREW AND SAM

I SCORED
SOME LIONS' TICKETS

SO WE HAVE A DATE
COMING UP.

     THEY WILL BE THRILLED.

GENTLEMEN, LADY,

WELCOME TO
THE FIRST MEETING

TO DISCUSS THE MATT KELL
MEMORIAL GOLF TOURNAMENT.

I'M HAPPY TO SAY WE HAVE
OUR CORPORATE SPONSORS

AND WE HOPE TO DOUBLE
WHAT WE RAISED LAST YEAR.

             -NICE!
             -GREAT.

         THAT'S AMAZING. MATT
         WOULD JUST BE SO PROUD

            OF ALL THE WORK
            YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

            AND SINCE THIS WILL
            BE AN ANNUAL EVENT,

     WE FORMALLY NEED TO CREATE
     A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION.

         AND THE MONEY WE RAISE
         WILL GO TO FAMILIES,

           LIKE YOURS,
  WHO WERE AFFECTED BY CANCER.

   THE FOUR OF US WILL MAKE UP
     THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

         NOW, WE NEED TO
      COME UP WITH A NAME.

WELL...

       I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
   THINKING ABOUT THAT A LOT,

         AND I'D REALLY
         LIKE TO CALL IT

     THE "NEW DAY FOUNDATION
          FOR FAMILIES

      IN HONOR OF MATT KELL
        AND CATHY SPEHN."

                 I DON'T GET IT.

GINA, THIS IS
MATT'S FOUNDATION.

    YEAH, AND THE GOLF OUTING

          IS SOMETHING
  THAT CAN REMAIN IN HIS NAME,

       BUT I'D REALLY LIKE
         THIS FOUNDATION

  TO BE IN BOTH OF THEIR NAMES.

RIGHT. I, UH... AHEM.

YEAH, IT JUST DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT TO ME.

        C-CATHY'S FAMILY

          WENT THROUGH
   THE SAME THING THAT WE DID.

RIGHT, BUT WE'RE NOT
CATHY'S BEST FRIENDS.

I MEAN, MATT WAS LIKE--
HE WAS LIKE OUR BROTHER.

          WE'RE DOING THIS
          FOR HIM AND HIS BOYS.

              I KNOW YOU
              AND MICHAEL SPEHN

             HAVE BEEN BECOMING
             FRIENDS, BUT...

       WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
     MORE THAN THAT, MARTY.

             [SCOFFS] NO MATTER.

                   I DON'T WANT
                   A FOUNDATION

             NAMED AFTER ANYONE
             BUT MATT.

IS EVERYBODY DONE
WITH THEIR HOMEWORK?

               YEAH.

 -THE BOYS ARE OUTSIDE, PLAYING.
           -OH, GOOD.

     ALRIGHT. LET'S JUST GET
  THIS CHICKEN OUT OF THE OVEN,

         'CAUSE YOUR DAD
  IS GONNA BE HOME IN A SECOND.

            ALRIGHT.

  YOU PUT NUTS INTO THE SAUCE.

      NO ONE IN OUR FAMILY
           LIKES THAT.

   OH, BUT I DID IT LAST TIME,

          AND EVERYONE
      THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

            IT'S JUST
  THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE DO IT.

        MY MOM KNEW THAT.

    BECAUSE SHE WAS YOUR MOM,

     AND SHE KNEW EVERYTHING
       THERE POSSIBLY WAS

     TO KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,

BECAUSE SHE LOVED YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

        IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
        I DON'T WANT ANY.

HEY!

     SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.

YEAH.
DINNER'S READY.

             I THINK
      I'M JUST GONNA, UM...

   UH, GET MY BOYS AND GO HOME
       FOR AN EARLY NIGHT.

         HEY, YOU GUYS!
            LET'S GO!

       IS SOMETHING WRONG?

NO. NO, NO.

       EVERYTHING'S FINE.

      I JUST, UM, YOU KNOW,
   I WANT TO GIVE THEM A BATH

      AND GET TO BED EARLY.

          ALRIGHT. HOW WAS
          THE FOUNDATION LUNCH?

          IT WAS OKAY.

      THE GUYS ONLY WANT TO
     PUT IT IN MATT'S NAME.

                             AH.

              TSK.

         AH, I'M NOT...

      IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

YEAH. I'M JUST
REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

          [DOOR OPENS]

ALRIGHT, YOU GUYS.
LET'S GO.

CHANGE OF PLANS.

        [MATT]: GOODBYE.
            GOODBYE.

              -BYE.
              -BYE.

       [CHARLOTTE]: I KNOW
    HOW TO COOK THREE THINGS.

      REALLY? THAT'S GREAT!

      BUT, UH, WHY ARE YOU
        TELLING ME THIS?

     WE DON'T NEED MRS. KELL
     TO COOK DINNER FOR US.

          I CAN DO IT.

              [DEFEATED SIGH]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       [STUDENTS CHATTING]

         WE SHOULD WAIT
    FOR MICHAEL AND THE KIDS.

              THEY ALREADY LEFT.

            THEY DID?

       HEY, ARE YOU SURE?

   'CAUSE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

   GO BUY THEIR CHRISTMAS TREE
           WITH THEM.

            YEAH. THEIR GRANDMA
            TOOK THEM HOME.

               OH.

           OKAY, WELL,
    LET'S GET YOU GUYS HOME,

     'CAUSE WE'VE GOT TO HEM
   YOUR ANGEL COSTUMES, RIGHT?

             HOP IN.

[MICHAEL ON PHONE]:
<i>HEY. SORRY ABOUT TODAY.</i>

<i>I GOT SO BUSY</i>

<i>AND THEN CATHY'S</i>
<i>PARENTS CAME BY.</i>

          I UNDERSTAND.

     WE WENT TO A TREE FARM
   AND CUT DOWN OUR OWN TREE.

<i>IT'S KIND OF</i>
<i>A FAMILY TRADITION.</i>

   WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

<i>ACTUALLY, UH...</i>

         CATHY'S PARENTS

       WANT US TO COME UP
  TO MULLET LAKE FOR CHRISTMAS.

      REALLY? BUT I THOUGHT
         THAT WE WERE...

       <i> THEY WERE THINKING</i>

       IT'D BE A NICE TIME
    TO GET EVERYONE TOGETHER.

      THEY WANT TO SCATTER
   CATHY'S ASHES AT THE LAKE.

 I THINK CATHY WOULD LIKE THAT.

        [CLICKS LIGHT ON]

           OF COURSE.

       YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

       YOU DO UNDERSTAND?

              <i> IT'S JUST THAT...</i>

        I THOUGHT THAT--

        YOU'RE GONNA MISS
    THE OPENING OF THE ATRIUM

      A-AND THE PAGEANT.

<i>I KNOW,</i>

    BUT IT'S CATHY'S PARENTS,
            YOU KNOW.

     THEY REALLY WANT TO BE
 AROUND THE KIDS THIS CHRISTMAS.

       UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

       I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
         THINKING, UM...

         [SIGHS HEAVILY]

 MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE SOME TIME
  AND JUST THINK ABOUT THINGS.

<i>FOR THE KIDS' SAKE.</i>

            I AGREE.

<i>YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT?</i>

YEAH. I MEAN, I'M GONNA HAVE
    MY PARENTS AND SISTER

         AND MATT'S MOM
       AND SISTER AROUND,

        SO I'M GONNA HAVE
   A FULL HOUSE AND... [SIGHS]

    I MEAN, IT'S NOT GONNA BE
         AN EASY HOLIDAY

                 <i> FOR ANY OF US.</i>

                   <i> IT'S ONLY</i>
                   <i> BEEN A YEAR.</i>

      I'M GLAD YOU'LL HAVE
     YOUR FAMILY AROUND YOU.

   YEAH, AND AFTER CHRISTMAS,

     WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA GO
      UP TO MY FOLKS' PLACE

  UNTIL AFTER NEW YEAR'S, SO...

          SO THAT'S IT?

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           I GUESS SO.

<i>GOODBYE, GINA.</i>

        GOODBYE, MICHAEL.

          [PHONE BEEPS]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

       [OUTBOARD PUTTERS]

           LIKE ALMOST
  EVERYTHING GOOD IN OUR LIVES,

      THIS PLACE CAME TO US
         BECAUSE OF YOU.

YOU WANTED US TO COME BACK HERE,
         AND SO WE HAVE.

          AND TODAY...

      WE COMMIT YOUR ASHES
      TO THIS LAKE FOREVER.

    WE WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS.

     GOD BLESS YOU, MY LOVE.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

            WHERE ARE MR. SPEHN
            AND THE KIDS?

        THEY WENT TO SEE
    THEIR GRANDMA AND GRANDPA

         FOR CHRISTMAS.

            WELL, WHAT ABOUT US?

 WELL, WE HAVE A LOT TO DO, TOO.

   I MEAN, IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

      YOU GOT YOUR GRANDMAS
          COMING OVER,

       AND TONIGHT WE HAVE
     THE CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.

                   I'M AN ANGEL!

          YES, YOU ARE.

I WANT CHARLOTTE

AND JACK AND DANNY
TO BE ANGELS, TOO.

       I DO, TOO, SWEETIE,

        BUT I DON'T THINK
  IT'S GONNA HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

                  FINISH UP.

I LOVE TURKEY.

YOUR MOM MADE THE BEST TURKEY IN
        THE WHOLE FAMILY.

            [GRUNTS]

  OH, SHE WAS A WONDERFUL COOK.

OH...

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

   MM! I SAVED ALL HER RECIPES
            FOR YOU.

      [MUSIC PLAYS QUIETLY
         ON THE STEREO]

     DAD, I WANT TO GO HOME.

WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE ANGELS

       AND I GOT A COSTUME
         AND EVERYTHING.

                  YEAH, I KNOW,
                  PAL, I KNOW.

              YOU'LL BE A ANGEL
              NEXT YEAR, OKAY?

WHAT'S HE TALKING
ABOUT, MICHAEL?

     UH, CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.

   [DREW]: HOW IS SANTA GONNA
        KNOW WE'RE HERE?

DREW AND I WERE GONNA
STAY UP ALL NIGHT.

             I KNOW.

          WHEN YOUR MOM
       WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

       SHE USED TO STAY UP
         ALL NIGHT LONG

          TO SEE SANTA,

       UNTIL SHE REALIZED
      HE SIMPLY WON'T COME

     UNTIL YOU FALL ASLEEP.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

            I'M GLAD WE'RE HERE.

          THIS IS
          MOM'S FAVORITE PLACE,

            SO IT SHOULD BE
            OUR FAVORITE PLACE.

THAT'S TRUE, SWEETHEART.

MM. SHE LOVED IT HERE.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

WE JUST HAVE BE AT THE CHURCH BY
   6:00 FOR A SHORT REHEARSAL.

          ARE YOU STILL
          SEEING MICHAEL SPEHN?

   OH. NO, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

        IT JUST FELT LIKE
         IT WAS TOO SOON

         TO BE INVOLVED
           WITH A MAN.

             GINA...

     I WATCHED YOU TAKE CARE
   OF MY SON FOR THREE YEARS.

             YOU WERE HIS HOPE,
             HIS SUPPORT,

            HIS LOVE.

        HE WOULD WANT YOU
    AND THE BOYS TO BE HAPPY.

                DOES MICHAEL
                MAKE YOU HAPPY?

            HE DOES.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

         WOULD YOU MIND
     IF I JUST TOOK A BREAK?

     OF COURSE, SWEETHEART.

                WE'LL TAKE CARE
                OF THE BOYS.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

           THANK YOU.

   I'LL NEVER STOP MISSING HER

  AND I WILL NEVER LOVE ANYONE

          I KNOW, BABY.

I WAS ONLY BEING
NICE TO MRS. KELL

      BECAUSE SHE WAS NICE
    TO ME AND JACK AND DANNY,

        BUT IF YOU WANT,
 I'LL NEVER SPEAK TO HER AGAIN.

  HONEY, WHY WOULD I WANT THAT?

I HEARD YOU
TELL DADDY

   THAT IF WE LIKED MRS. KELL,

       IT MIGHT HURT MOM,

       AND THAT MRS. KELL

       I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
              I...

                      YOUR MOMMY

     YEAH? WHAT'S GOING ON?

               UH, GET THE BOYS.

               WE NEED
               TO GET YOU HOME.

        WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
       WHAT ABOUT SUPPER?

             NO, NO, NO.
             FORGET ABOUT THAT.

      YOUR KIDS AND GINA'S
  ARE GONNA BE ANGELS IN CHURCH

  AND WE HAVE TO GET THEM THERE
            ON TIME.

                   WE'LL EAT
                   ON THE ROAD!

        WHAT? IT'S 4:00!
 IT'S A TWO-AND-HALF-HOUR DRIVE.

      WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT.

I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY,

      BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY.

              COME ON! LET'S GO.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ARE WE THERE YET?

                    NO! NOT YET.

WE HAVE TO
BE THERE BY 7:00.

           IT'S OKAY.
      WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

       OKAY.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

THAT WAS THE EXIT
FOR THE CHURCH.

WE MISSED IT.

             [BOYS]:
       WHERE ARE WE GOING?

 JUST NEED TO STOP BY THE HOUSE
          FOR A SECOND.

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

 [PASTOR KARL]: MARY AND JOSEPH
       HAD NOWHERE TO STAY

     AND IT WAS ALMOST TIME
   FOR THEIR BABY TO BE BORN.

      THE INNKEEPER IN TOWN

      SAID THAT THEY COULD
    TAKE SHELTER IN THE BARN

        WITH THE ANIMALS.

       OUT IN THE FIELDS,

     AN ANGEL OF THE LORD--

 -...APPEARED TO THE SHEPHERDS--
           -GO AHEAD!

      ...WHO WERE GUARDING
     THEIR FLOCKS BY NIGHT.

       THE ANGEL ANNOUNCED

  THAT THE SAVIOR HAD BEEN BORN
    IN THE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM.

      THE SHEPHERDS DECIDED
     TO TRAVEL TO BETHLEHEM

    TO SEE THE CHRIST-CHILD.

            SUDDENLY,
     A GREAT HOST OF ANGELS

       APPEARED AND BEGAN
     SINGING PRAISES TO GOD.

           THE ANGELS
    BEGAN TO SPREAD THE WORD

 THAT THE CHRIST-CHILD WAS BORN.

      â™ª OH, NIGHT DIVINE â™ª

      â™ª OH, NIGHT DIVINE â™ª

   -HEY! THE SPEHNS ARE HERE!
      -THE SPEHNS ARE HERE!

     [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

     [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
            CONTINUE]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

              OH...

      [MURMURING IN CHURCH]

   MERRY CHRISTMAS.

                MERRY CHRISTMAS.

   DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE SAW
       THE DOUBLE RAINBOW?

WELL, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

   AND THE RAIN, IT JUST FELL
     SO HARD ON OUR LIVES...

BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

 THAT THE LIGHT HAS CUT THROUGH

   AND IT HAS GIVEN US COLORS

       THAT WE COULD NEVER
   HAVE EVEN IMAGINED BEFORE.

THIS LIFE,

       YOU KNOW, IT CAN BE
EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN BEFORE.

AND THAT DOESN'T
BETRAY MATT

            OR CATHY.

        I-IT HONORS THEM.

             I KNOW.

         AND I LOVE YOU.

        I LOVE YOU, TOO.

AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

             [SIGHS]

       [GINA GASPS SOFTLY]

            [LAUGHS]

       WILL YOU MARRY ME?

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

            SHE SAID YES!

      [CONGREGATION CHEERS]

  [LOUD APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

             -WHOO!
              -OH!

     [CELEBRATING CONTINUES]

              [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

        â™ª THERE IS HOPE â™ª

    â™ª AND THERE IS LAUGHTER â™ª

    â™ª THERE ARE BLUE SKIES â™ª

         â™ª AFTER RAIN â™ª

         â™ª YOU HAVE COME
         INTO MY LIFE â™ª

           â™ª I KNOW â™ª

    â™ª THAT I CAN LOVE AGAIN â™ª

      â™ª THERE IS SOMETHING
         IN YOUR SMILE â™ª

 â™ª REACHING DEEP INSIDE OF ME â™ª

  â™ª THIS WAS MEANT TO HAPPEN â™ª

    â™ª THIS WAS MEANT TO BE â™ª

        â™ª ALL THE COLORS
        OF THE RAINBOW â™ª

   â™ª ARE DANCING IN THE SUN â™ª

           â™ª THE BEST
        IS YET TO COME â™ª

        â™ª ALL THE COLORS
        OF THE RAINBOW â™ª

        â™ª ARE TELLING ME
      THAT YOU'RE THE ONE â™ª

       â™ª A WHOLE NEW LIFE
        HAS JUST BEGUN â™ª
