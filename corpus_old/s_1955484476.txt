Can I help you?

It's your brother
and his family, they're uh...

What?

Are you done yet?

No, sweetie.

Are you done now?

Soon, I promise.

You said this would be fun.

I know. I know.

You load the fridge downstairs?

Mmmhmm.

Did you?

I said yes.

Three, two, one.

Alright, go!

I'm so glad you two are
working things out.

He's so good with her.

Not too bad on the eyes,
either.

Yeah, he's a rock star when
he's not screwing his clients.

Joke.

Uh oh, almost!

Yay!

Candy!

It's all mine!

Can you take her, honey?

I'm running late.

Come on, we talked about this.

About what?

Rough sakes.

What?

Jane, I got a jobs
at ten and two.

I've got an interview
with the "times".

Fine. I'll take her to school
but you need to pick her up.

Fine.

No doughnuts.

Are you guys getting
a divorce?

No.

Of course not.

Marnie's parents are
getting divorced.

Yeah, sweetie,
you're not marnie.

You guys fight.

Hey, kiddo.

You're passive-aggressive.

Did mom tell you that?

No.

Sweetie, your mother and i
love each other very much.

We always will.

But... sometimes people
make mistakes.

I'm not the easiest
to deal with, alright?

Your work has been centered

on these old houses
for quite some time.

What's the fascination?

My parents died in an accident
when I was quite young.

Uh...

No, that's fine.

I uh, I don't actually remember
a thing about them.

But it feels like forgetting
something you know is important.

You just have no idea
what it was.

I've become fascinated
by these empty vessels

that once housed such life.

I want to go to work
with daddy.

Carpentry is dangerous.

But this is so boring.

<i> The houses are like epitaphs.</i>

<i> They're glimpses</i>
<i> into lives once lived.</i>

<i> Echoes of the people</i>
<i> who once lived there.</i>

Is that it? Nope.

Is that it?

Of course not, stupid.

Who were they?

Where did they go?

Are they still alive?

What did they leave behind?

So what have you left behind?

Uh...

I'll tell you what.

How about we stop at bj's
on the way home?

Wow, turning down ice cream?

This must be serious.

<i> Mom?</i>

<i> Mom, what is it?</i>

<i> Mom, you're scaring me!</i>

Hello?

It's ok, you know.

It is.

Is this yours?

<i> What's your name?</i>

That's my mommy.

No.

No.

I said no!

Alice!

Alice!

Ali!

I was calling for you.

I know. That's why I came.

I still expect to go
for ice cream.

Come on.

<i> Hi, county archives please?</i>

<i> Yeah, I'd uh...</i>

<i> Like to order the property</i>
<i> record for 1268...</i>

Ok.

Five...

Four...

Three...

Two...

Olly
olly oxen free

honey.

You startled me.

What are you doing?

I wet the bed.

Hey, it's ok.

It happens to the best of us.

No it doesn't.

Even daddy does
when he drinks too much.

Come on.

Let's go.

<i> Are you alright?</i>

Oh my gosh.

<i> Jane.</i>

I'm so sorry.

<i> Come on, that's the second</i>
<i> time this week.</i>

I know, I know, I know.

I can be there in
twenty minutes, ok?

<i> You know what? Never mind.</i>

<i> I'll get her.</i>

No. I'll leave right away,
i swear.

<i> Fine.</i>

<i> I'll call the school.</i>

I'm sorry.

Hello?

I'm sorry, who?

Alice, I can't hear you.

I can't hear a word, honey.

She wants you to come back.

Five... four... three... two...

Olly olly oxen free.

<i> You need to come back.</i>

<i> Jane?</i>

Jane?

Jane.

Thank god.

Jane?

Mommy?

There's been a mistake.

You had an accident.

I don't know you.

It's not funny.

Doctor!

I don't know either of you.

Can we get a doctor in here?

What's wrong with her?

Where am I?

Hey, why are you here?

My mom went crazy.

She's not crazy,
she just has a secret.

Although the injuries she
sustained in the accident

were quite minor

they appear to have aggravated a
very severe, but older, injury.

Ok.

Jane?

Yeah.

Doctor Michaels asked me
if I would speak with you.

Ok.

I'm Liam.

I'm the on-call psychiatrist.

I don't need a shrink.

Well, Jane, I can help.

I can help stimulate the
recovery of your memory...

If you let me.

You see these sine lines?

They're remnants
from an old trauma,

twenty years or more.

Your wife's skull was fractured
in seven places.

Scar tissue can impede
long-term memory,

kind of like a splinter
in the brain,

waiting for the body
to push it out.

You're mistaken.

And...?

Her memory could
snap right back.

But I have to warn you,
it could take months.

I once had a patient who had to
re-learn the English language.

It might even explain
your fascination

with photographing old houses,
Mrs. reyer.

I'm tired.

Sure. Yeah.

Another time then.

Maybe spend some time
with your family, Mrs. reyer.

I think it'll do them
as much good as you.

Retten.

I'm sorry.

Reyer was my maiden name.

Yes it was.

Your memory is
improving already.

Look, once she gets back
into familiar surroundings

her condition will
likely improve.

Hey.

Are you alright?

Yeah.

That's good.

Do you remember me now?

Of course.

Some things are still fuzzy
but it's getting better.

As long as you remember
what matters most.

Look, I'm gonna get her home
and uh, fed,

but we'll be back tomorrow,
alright?

Ok.

Love you.

And no doughnuts!

I'm not sure why I said that.

The brain is a remarkable thing.

It can... it can re-wire itself,
repair itself.

Even create false memories
to protect us.

That's why we must treat the
cause, not just the symptom.

Very good.

Is there a heaven?

Uh, I don't know.

I'd like to think so.

Then there's a hell.

Sweetie, I think we live on
in the memories of the people

that loved us.

If we were good
in their life

then their memories of us
will be too.

What if they don't remember you?

What happens then?

Hey, mommy's not gonna
forget you.

I met a girl who said
she would.

Clearly she's a horrible little
person from a broken home.

Doofas.

Come in.

Come in!

I said, come in.

You gonna open it?

Jeez.

I didn't mean to startle you,

you've just been staring
at that box for two minutes.

Oh my god.

<i> Jane?</i>

Ok.

Hello?

Hello?

Oh, shit.

Hey.

Where did you get these?

The county archives
delivered them.

That's not possible.

My foster parents would have
told me.

Jane.

These files just didn't appear
out of the blue.

You ordered them.

When?

You tell me.

I can't remember.

You own that house.

No!

I forget little things,

like appointments,
birthdays, pick-ups.

Not...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't even be here.

I should have picked her up.

The trust fund's been paying
the property tax.

It's managed by a...
Patrick ryer.

I think you have an uncle.

That explains why you keep
trying to photograph the place.

Jane, hey.

Hey.

We'll figure this out.

It's gonna be really positive.

It's an opportunity.

I barely remember
my own family.

Visiting your childhood home

could really stimulate some
repressed memories.

Why don't you at least
call your uncle?

Spend some time
at the house.

It certainly can't hurt.

<i> Hello?</i>

Patrick ryer?

<i> Speaking.</i>

<i> Hello?</i>

<i> Are you still there?</i>

Uh... yeah.

I um...

Are you the brother of-

who's calling, please?

<i> My name's Jane.</i>

Jane?

<i> Yeah.</i>

Wow.

Uh...

Um... are we...

Are you my uncle?

I haven't seen you in a...
Uh... but yeah.

<i> Yeah, I sure am.</i>

Um...

Would it be ok if- if
i came by sometime?

Um...

<i> You're welcome any time.</i>

<i> Of course.</i>

Ok.

Kinda familiar.

Maybe it's just like every
other place I've photographed.

I don't know.

Patrick?

You're the spitting image of
your mother.

We tore down the old barn,

turned your father's fields
there into corn and soy bean,

if you believe.

Your foster parents sold me
the fields

on the condition that you
keepin' the house.

Can't say I much wanted it

on account of the memories
good and bad, you know?

Um, I've gotta get something
off of my chest.

It's been weighing on me.

Um... about you
and foster care.

I just didn't know the first
thing about bringing up a kid.

I thought it'd be best for you.

Still, somehow it...

I don't know.

Didn't sit right with me.

I'm sorry.

Let me know if you need
anything.

What happened to them?

I assumed somebody told you,
janey.

I...

Your parents and your sister
passed on in that house.

I'm sorry.

I'm just the idiot
with my foot in my mouth.

If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

So anything familiar?

I have never seen him before.

You guys coming or what?

It doesn't look too bad.

It's hot and it smells.

Tell us what you really feel,
kiddo.

I just did.

It does kinda smell,
doesn't it?

Like old socks.

Like stinky old socks.

What's wrong, mom?

Jane?

You guys check out
the house.

I'll take a look out back.

Come on. I wanna explore.

Alright, monkey.

Be careful.

Watch out for the big coyote!

No!

Looks like your mother's
old room when she was your age.

This one's locked.

See?

We're in luck.

Alice?

Babe, be careful with that.

I will.

Hey, that's not a toy,
honey.

Sweetie, it's vintage.

But it's in a little
girl's room.

Yeah, but when that little girl
played with it,

it wasn't vintage.

I'm gonna stay in your mother's
old room.

Let's go.

Come on, let's find-

it's alright.

<i> Uh oh.</i>

<i> I hope mommy has another key</i>
<i> or else we are in trouble.</i>

<i> You lost it.</i>

You remember me?

Of course.

What about our marriage?

It's fuzzy.

How fuzzy?

What do you want me to say?

We were having some problems,
but who doesn't, right?

You remember that I have a
monster dong though, right?

Do you?

Do you see their eyes?

Look in their eyes.

They're rectangular.

Hey, janey.

Someone needs their sugar fix.

Meet you at the car.

Candy apples!

Yes!

Come on.

I'm gonna eat all
the candy apples.

Mine, mine, mine!

Help you find anything?

I'm ok. Just browsing.

Take your time.

Excuse me.

Can I see that?

It's a shame to hang on to such
a tragedy, I know,

but I never put much stock
in what they print anyway.

Hello?

<i> Jane.</i>

Liam.

<i> We had an appointment.</i>

Did we?

I'm sorry, I uh... I just uh...

I took- I took your advice
and we're uh...

We're at the family farm.

<i> Oh, good.</i>

I'm sorry about the appointment,

I must have just-

I must have just forgot.

<i> That's ok, I'm proud of you</i>
<i> for giving it a chance.</i>

<i> I'm glad you're alright.</i>

Where are you?

<i> At this moment?</i>

I'm in my office, why?

<i> Uh, Jane, I gotta go.</i>

<i> I have a patient, but um...</i>

<i> We'll talk soon, ok?</i>

<i> I'll be seeing you.</i>

Liam!

Liam!

Liam.

Give me a friggin' break.

If you did bad things
but don't remember,

are they still part of
who you are?

What?

Never mind.

Turn it off.

Alan.

Hey.

Hey.

Shh.

They'll hear you.

<i> When you have a bad dream,</i>

<i> write it down on a piece of</i>
<i> paper and put it in a box.</i>

And the butterfly fairies
will change those things

so they're not scary anymore.

<i> The fairies are in the box?</i>

<i> Mmmhmm.</i>

And they're nice?

They are nice but they're
also tricksters.

They tell us riddles.

To understand them you have
to listen carefully

because your eyes
can be easily tricked.

Alice.

Let's go.

Alice isn't here right now.

Alan, get up!

Get up!

You come find us.

What are you doing, mommy?

It's time to get up.

It's 4:30!

Go back to bed.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Five, four, three, two, one.

Five... four... three... two...
One.

My brother was a lot of things.

Drunk.

An asshole at times, sure.

But he... he really loved
your mom.

He loved you kids,

even if he- even if he
didn't show it.

I know it's hard digging up
all this stuff.

I'm not sure if
I'm seeing things.

Remembering things.

Or someone's messing
with my head.

Did I kill them?

The only person who knows
what happened in that house

is you.

How could I forget something
like that?

It was an act of mercy.

I can't remember anything
about any of them.

Well, your pa was
a hell of a dancer.

Hard worker.

He was funny.

He was kind when he wanted
to be.

I mean, he had a temper, sure,
same as anyone.

I don't know what else
to tell you.

Thanks.

Morning, mommy.

You look really tired.

Thanks.

Can we go to the lake
and skip stones?

I don't know, monkey.

Please? Pretty please?

Maybe later, ok?

<i> Fine.</i>

<i> I'm sorry if Suzie kept you</i>
<i> awake last night.</i>

What'd you just say?

<i> Morning.</i>

My two favourite ladies.

How're we feeling?

Great.

Can you take her
to the lake?

You ok?

I wanna head back today.

I'm not feeling so good.

Tell me what's up.

I think this place is making
me worse.

We'll go home after lunch.

Who wants to skip
some stones?

I do!

Are there any bears
in these woods?

No.

They live further north.

What about wolves?

Well, you never know.

Hello?

Suzie?

What about fairies?

Would any fairies live
down here?

I don't know.

Well, you never can tell.

Fairies are tricksters.

Tinkerbell wasn't a trickster.

Yeah, that's different.

She wasn't real.

I see.

So real fairies are tricksters.

Yeah, they're good.

They tell us riddles.

You have to listen carefully

because your eyes
are easily tricked.

<i> Stupid.</i>

Suzie?

<i> You shouldn't be here.</i>

I know it's you.

Please don't hide.

We have to.

The monster's coming.

Hide!

Hide!

Shh!

You have to run!

I can't!

Run!

How do you know so much
about fairies?

I had a dream about it.

This nice lady taught me
a song.

She did?

Yeah.

She also said mommy's
gonna hurt me.

Honey, why would you say that?

Did mommy do something?

Mommy's not the real one
to be afraid of.

Then who is?

The monster in the bedroom.

I'm going to start loading
the car.

<i> Alice!</i>

<i> Alice!</i>

<i> Alice.</i>

Alice.

Alice.

We can't let you leave, janey.

We can't.

What are you doing?

Looking for you.

But I'm right here.

Were you singing?

The fairy song.

Where'd you hear it?

I don't know.

This is important.

Where'd you hear that song?

I don't know.

Of course you do!

Now you tell me
where you heard it!

I don't know-

Alice!

Hey!

Hey, what are you doing?

What the fuck?

It's nothing.

You were hurting her.

It was an accident.

Don't bullshit me, Jane!

She was driving me nuts.

I just want to go!

Listen!

Come on.

No, no, no.

Jane.

You didn't.

Didn't what, Alan?

Tell me you didn't.

Of course I didn't.

I swear.

<i> Daddy!</i>

<i> Daddy!</i>

Alice!

Alice?

Alice!

What happened?

The man was chasing me.

What man?

We had to hide.

She must have imagined it.

What man?

The monster under the bed.

Alright, sweetie.

Just-

oh god, Ali.

Ali, look.

Let me look.

Ok, relax.

Relax.

Just relax, relax, relax.

She's having an asthma attack.

What do you mean?

Just like my sister.

We gotta go.

Come on.

Hang on, sweetie. Hang on.

Goddammit.

It won't open.

Jane.

They won't let me leave.

Go.

Jane!

Get her out of here!

Ok.

Let's play.

Olly olly oxen free.

I know you.

Psst. Quickly.
You've gotta hide.

He's coming!

You've gotta hide!

Hide, janey!

Shhh. It's him.

Shhh.

Pretty girl.

You shouldn't be here.

Of course I should.

I even brought a present
for you.

Stay away from me.

Janey?

I'm not the monster.

He is.

Shhh.

Pretty girl.

You shouldn't be here.

Of course I should.

Just listen to the fairy song
and everything will be alright.

I'm fine.

Liam, let's go up.

Liam.

Liam.

Come on, let's go up.

Mommy?

No, no.

<i> Mommy!!</i>

Sweetheart, no.

No. Shh.

I need you to be quiet.
I need you to be quiet.

It'll be fine, just shhh.

Quiet.

Stop it!

Stop it!

You get away from her.

Jenny, wait.

Liam! Liam!

Wait, Jenny!
No, no, no!

Don't call him!

Don't call him.

Wait, wait, wait.

Kiddo.

Christ!

The brain is a remarkable thing.

It can re-wire itself,
repair itself.

Even create false memories
to protect us.

Very good.

I barely remember
my own family.

I never put much stock
in what they print, anyway.

Where are you?

Daddy?

You should have
just told me.

Babe, we're trapped here.

I can only guide you
to the truth

and you can set us free.

I'm sorry.

Don't be.

Don't be. We love you.

Hey. Are you alright?

Hey.

Alice.

Alice is fine.

She calmed down
once we hit the road.

Alan, I... it's going
to be better now.

I promise.

Let's just change that tire
and get out of here.

Where's Alice?

I dropped her off at Patrick's.

What?

Jane!

Hey, what's going on?!

Yeah, put your hands
on some cookies.

What's that you got there?

I didn't know kids still played
with Jacks anymore.

You sure were excited when we
played with those cows.

You wanna do that again?

Moo cow!

We can do that again.

I might need a favour first,
though.

Like what?

Well, it'd have to be
our secret.

Can you keep a secret?

It's nothing much,
just a game.

They told me not to play
with you.

Who did?

No one.

Who would say something
mean like that?

I don't know.

Yes, you do.

I just want to know what
they've been saying to you.

Looks like they've said too
much already.

Let's go. Come on.

Let's go.

Hey!

They're so silly.

Indeed.

Come on now.

You really need that?

A lot of foxes, Suzie.

Foxes everywhere.

Alice, not Suzie.

Yeah.

Patrick.

Hey!

Patrick!

Keep your distance.

Patrick, don't shoot!

Please, don't shoot!

Don't shoot.

I wanna go home!

Patrick!

Patrick.

I wanna go home!

It's ok, sweetie. It's ok.

Everything's gonna be alright.

Please, Patrick.

Don't hurt her.

Please.

Tell me what you want,
Patrick.

A second chance.

Daddy!

<i> Hey. Hey.</i>

<i> Hey.</i>

<i> Hey.</i>

You can't leave me here.

<i> No, stop!</i>

<i> You can't!</i>

Jane!

I- I never meant...

I loved your sister,
i just- we're family.

It was a mistake.

Tell that to them.

No!

No!

<i> Jane!</i>

<i> I'm sorry!</i>

Jane!

Are there dead people
in there?

Yes, honey.

Eww.

Come on, let's go play
by the woods.

See if there's any bears
in there.

You said they lived
further north!

<i> Olly olly oxen free.</i>
