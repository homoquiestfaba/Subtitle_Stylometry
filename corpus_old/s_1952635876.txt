Dear viewer

... I shot this film 
in the San Francisco bay area ...

... when I was seventeen years old
and still in high school.

Working with a budget of $4000,
I struggled to go to school,

work part-time to finance the film,
and film on nights and weekends ...

... with the help 
of a volunteer cast and crew.

I am proud to say 
that this is my first film whatsoever.

And I knew nothing...

Filming took a year.
Editing took several months.

I emptied out my meager life savings,
worked on a script with friends,

bought and learned how to use 
an extraordinary digital camera (canon xl-2),

and learned how to edit.

Music was composed by friends 
or used by permission.

This film was the most difficult 
and yet most rewarding experience ...

... of the first seventeen years of my life.

I hope and pray everyday 
that I'll get a chance to do it again.

Lastly, I am quite proud to have shot in digital.

And I am hoping a similar approach to distribution 
will work itself out in the end...

...as I constantly dream about 
another chance at "this filmmaking thing."

Please share this film.
And feel free to drop me a line!

Thank you for all of your support,

I don't need this right now.

I don't care where you go.

Just, just leave.

Come on, look at yourself.  

This is not just a game.  

This is real.

This is me.

You are so concerned 
with all the other people around you ...

... that you're ignoring the fact 
that you yourself are the problem

why are you here?

why did you have to come back?

fine fine fine

Hey look boy, you wanna live here, ...

by our rules, alright?

That means you gotta do 
some fucking chores.

Your mom might have let you 
roll around in your little problems, ...

... but she's not here
