Assuming the Ottoman Empire
finally becomes defunct,

Russia would get the Dardanelles,
the portion closest to them,

and the Italians,
the islands of mainland.

The French had no problem with that?
The French have problems with everything.

That's their nature.

And the big pieces?

Once I conceded the control over Syria
and Lebanon to them it got easier.

Let us read your mind.

Mr Churchill, do you really want
Lebanon for the British Empire?

It's a mess grown in a 1,000 years
that no one will ever disentangle.

Syria might pose a bigger problem.

Sunni, Shiite, Alawis, Druze,
Christian, all at each other's throats.

And up North, the Kurds.
Let the French deal with the Kurds.

Or let the French
try to deal with the Kurds.

And let them fail.

I know where all our intelligence
comes from.

Are you trying to say...
from the woman?

From that woman?

Petty rivalries only after cocktails.

Now, to us.

Zone B: our area of influence.

I wrestle from the French
Baghdad, Basra, Kuwait.

This will now be
under our direct control.

And how do we delineate the borders?

That will fall in place later.
Now.

This is the moment.
It has to be now.

Well. Our issues start down here,
in the South.

Now it's just a vague dotted line.

We have a problem with Ibn Saud.
The scoundrel.

In fact we have two problems.

Firstly, he wants the whole of Arabia
as a separate country for himself.

The bastard.

And secondly,
he wants a flexible border.

One of his tribes is moving North
for the summer pastures.

There are no bloody pastures.
There's only sand.

And he wants a border...

according to the movement
of people, not territory.

East is not fly.

Who knows best about tribes?

Lineages, affiliations, rivalries.

Who knows best
about Bedouin tribes?

And who is going
to rule over all of this?

We are talking
to potential future kings.

Who knows the candidates?
Who knows them best?

The woman. Gertrude.

Gertrude who?

Gertrude Bell.
A silly bitch.

It's a chattering windbag
of conceited, gushing,

heavy chested man-woman,

a globe trotting,
rump-wagging, blethering ass.

Gertrude.

Gertrude, look at me.
Mother, don't.

What?
Don't tell me how to behave.

I'm afraid I'm going to, anyway.

You will smile.
Yes, mother.

You will not scare
the young men with your intelligence.

How do I do that?
I cannot play dumb.

Just... listen to what
they have to say and smile.

That will be hard.

Gertrude...
I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

And then?
You mean after the lion?

Yes.
Well then I shot an elephant.

And all of this was
in the South of Sudan?

No, my hunting party
had moved to Kenya by then. - Oh.

God, was that a safari!

I would guess
you didn't shoot just one elephant.

First a rhino, then a lion,
and then two elephant bulls.

Are there any elephants left in Africa?

You meaning what, young lady?

Gertrude...

I would love to elope with you.

Where to? Paris, India?

The pyramids?

Out there, there is a barn.

You mean hay?

Nobody would notice
if we left for a few minutes.

You mean for fornication.
Quick and straight forward.

Absolutely.

Like the cattle in the field?
Absolutely.

Arnold Runcie, I barely know you.

But you seem to like cows.
Absolutely.

How many do you have?

Near Newcastle
I have 800 Herefordshire.

Up North, in Scotland, 2,000.

Angus?
Angus. Yes.

Black Angus.

Miss Bell, thank you for the honour.

Over here, Mr. Havenhurst.

Over here to your left.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Dear God!

Send me an earthquake, please.

I can't take it. I can't take it any longer.

I feel so domesticated.

It's stifling to me.
Gertrude, what am I supposed to say?

I can say it. We should never
have allowed you to go to Oxford.

But dear,
she's one of only four women

to study history and to graduate
with the highest honours.

A young unmarried woman
from a good family should not...

Should not be allowed out on the streets
without a chaperon.

Gertrude, would you please sit down?
No, I don't want to sit down.

Darling, I have always supported you.

I watched you
climb sharp, high rocks.

Let us not forget the string of nannies
who quit because of your wilfulness.

Well, so what.

Do you remember that time when
you climbed that tall beech tree in the park?

And you had a very large lamp shade
on your back.

Yes, I remember that.

You were only 5,
you were already reading voraciously.

Somebody stupidly showed you
Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook.

I remember the one with the parachute.
Who ever would need a parachute?

Everyone.
Everyone needs a parachute.

It probably hurt me more than you
when you broke your ankle.

I don't like to think about it,
it hurts me even today.

Get me out of here, please.

Please, please, get me out of here!

India, Arabia, anywhere.
Please?

You know...

However how much it hurts me
when you're not around,

we are going to have
to get you out of here.

Where?

What about Tehran?

The embassy.

I'm going to introduce Gertrude now.

It's introduction time.
Give me your glass for a moment? Thank you.

Excellencies.

Here you go. Ladies and gentlemen,
come forward.

Come forward. Thank you.

I would like to introduce
Gertrude Lowthian Bell to you.

She is a brilliant young scholar.

And I am blessed
to call her my niece.

She is actually the daughter
of my wife Mary's sister.

And we love her.

And I'm sure you all will make
her stay with us a wonderful experience.

As to the return of my dear wife,

boys, the wildlife is over.

No more riding on horseback
into our dining room.

No more drunken orgies
on our well-groomed British lawn.

No more rescues
of damsels in distress.

And no more public display

of the wildest irreverence
towards our beloved Queen Victoria.

Who, I think, needs to spend time here

to lean her from her grand design
of a prudish empire.

To the British Empire!

And to Persia.

The country of 5,000 years of poetry.

Why is my glass empty?

Where is the champagne?

The scents... I can't believe it.

And the birds.
Nightingale.

When I cry at night into my pillow,
she always makes me feel happy.

She? I think
it's only the males who sing.

Don't spoil it.
I'm sorry, Flo...

Hello.

I'm Henry Cadogan.

I am...
Henry is the secretary of the Embassy.

Actually,
I'm only the third secretary.

Ms. Bell, I welcome you to the embassy
of Her Majesty the Queen.

Her Prudish Majesty.

I've been officially assigned
to be your guardian

and to entertain you, so...

If there's anything you need at all,
please let me know.

I will do that.

Henry.

Oh Henry, please show us
your trick shots.

Florence, the table isn't even free.

Please. Please. Please. Please?

No, I'm not a circus performer.

He has two unbelievable trick shots.

Show us your "Orbit of the Moon".

Florence, it's embarrassing.

What's your second trick shot?
The "Frog Leap".

Henry, show us your card trick.

He has the greatest of card tricks.

Really?
Please?

Florence, it's a silly trick. No!

Come, come.

Ms. Bell,
may I suggest at the residency,

you put your bed out
on the roof under the sky.

I do love the stars at night.

Although I'll have to put out
the mosquito netting for you.

The mosquitoes are awful.

Mrs. Lascelles,
are we not boring you?

No.

Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

Florence. Florence,
will you please come over?

Now?

The new Italian ambassador
has a present for you.

Henry, I should come right back.
Hurray.

It's like "The Beast's Garden".

It's a perfect nightmare
of flowers and scents.

Mr. Cadogan, do you by any chance
know what this inscription says?

Yes.

It's in Farsi.

But a medieval form of it.

Can you read it? -Hmm

"With them,
the seed of wisdom did I sow

"and with my own hand
labour'd it to grow."

"And this was all the harvest
that I reap'd

"I came like water
and like wind I go."

Miss Bell, you know poetry?

You know Omar Khayyam.
Yes, I do.

I want to learn his language.

<i>Mother dearest,</i>

<i>I'm using the opportunity
to send you this</i>

<i>With today's diplomatic pouch.</i>

<i>My first week has been most precious
and I have started to learn Farsi</i>

<i>in order to read the poets
in their original.</i>

<i>Mr. Cadogan, who works at the embassy,
is very helpful in this.</i>

<i>He is agreeable,
intelligent, well-read,</i>

<i>looking after us, Florence and me,
as his special property.</i>

<i>I like him.</i>

<i>He's invited us
to ride with him today."</i>

But Henry, you can't ride.
Yes, I can.

What if you fall?

It happens to the best.
You will get hurt.

I don't like you to ride.

Why don't you join us?
I'm afraid of horses.

Bye.

Miss Bell, this is my favourite place
in all of the countryside.

After the winter,
when the water level is very high,

and the shepherds swim their flocks
down here for the summer pasture.

Sometimes, a thousand of sheep.

And the shepherds swim among them
on these inflated goat skins.

Yes, I've seen that.
Have you?

In Babylonian reliefs.

They were doing it 4,000 years ago.

They still do.
It's extraordinary.

Sometimes I go up there.

I'm a fairly good mountain climber,

but how for God's sake
do you get up there?

I must confess it's pretty easy.

You walk around the back
and go up.

Why?

Why do you go there?

I go when I'm lonely.

I get very lonely.

Gertrude.

Yes?
A letter.

A letter for me?
No, for Henry.

You mean Mr. Cadogan?
Yes, Henry.

Could you please
hand him this letter?

Why don't you give it to him yourself?

I cannot.

Why can't you?

Gertrude, from woman to woman,
you won't say anything?

No, I won't.
To no one?

Not a soul. I promise.

Ever since last year. I mean
since one year, two months and 11 days...

What?

I have had...

a passion for Henry.

What did he say to you today?
Did he mention me today?

No, we just talked about shepherds.

Why can't you give Mr. Cadogan
your letter?

I just can't.

And I sending him letters by mail
might cause gossip upon its arrival.

Letters?

I wrote him 202.

It's terrible.

I can't send them.

Sweet Florence, my darling.

You know I'd do anything for you.

But I cannot
fight the battles of your heart.

<i>Father dearest,</i>

<i>I do not know where to begin.</i>

<i>The Orient is like a prolonged dream.</i>

<i>I am being taken care of wonderfully
by Auntie, and for all the rest</i>

<i>Mr. Cadogan is a fine guide
and guardian.</i>

<i>He takes care of Florence and me.</i>

<i>He shows us lovely things
from the bazaars.</i>

<i>He's always there
when we want him.</i>

<i>And never when we don't.</i>

Hurry.

Yes. Thank you for bringing us.

You see,
they really eat the heads here.

Do they?

This is a delicacy?
Yes.

Such lovely colours!

Yes.
They are so pretty.

This is paprika. You can try it.

Can I?

How to say "Thank you".

Do you love it, Florence?

Miss Bell.

I stayed up,
hoping I would see you.

I didn't come to play billiards.

Why did you come?

I came for your card trick.

I see.

Card trick it is.

You have to come over here.

As you can see,
the deck is already shuffled.

The red cards and the black cards
are placed at random.

This trick is fiendish.

From this point on,
I will not touch the cards.

You'll do everything.

Me?

I'm going to cast a spell over you.

And under this spell,
without looking,

you'll be able to determine
if the card is red or if it is black.

Without looking at the cards?

That's impossible.

According to the laws of probability.

Under my spell...

the laws do not exist.

You may begin.

Do not turn it over.

I'm not.

What colour is it?

Black.

Black.

Red.

Black.

Red.

Black. Black.

Red. Red. Red.

Voilà.

Mr. Cadogan,
you did touch the cards again.

When you turned them over.

Gertrude, you're very smart.

You're the only one
who's ever noticed that.

Did you just call me "Gertrude", Henry?

Yes, I did.

And did you just call me Henry?

The walls have ears.

How does the trick really work?

I'm not going to tell you.

But you're very close.

Am I?

I love the birds here.

I come here for the birds.

This is the Tower of Silence.

Gertrude, you're sure
you wish to climb all the way up?

Yes, I'm sure.

Yes.

There may be bones.

Maybe skulls.

Maybe vultures.

What if we anger the vultures?

They've probably heard us
and flown away.

As I told you,

this is what the Zoroastrians
leave their dead to the vultures.

They considered them sacred.

You're scared?

I'm not afraid.

Gertrude Lowthian Bell.

I wish to kiss you.

Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

Run. Come on.

Florence,
stop that moody brooding.

Father...
Frank.

Don't Frank me.
She's a girl.

My dinner table is a no cry zone.

I'm sorry I gave birth to a daughter.
You wanted a boy, obviously.

Absolutely not!

You could've born me a dromedary,
and I would have minded.

Now look, darling.

There is a good side about tears.

If you cry them out,
you need to pee much less.

Let's smoke a cigar together.

Bread.
Yeah.

A piece of bread.

A loaf of bread.

Sharab wine.
A flask of wine.

And so...

You're doing so well.

I am?
Yes.

"A loaf of bread beneath the bough.
A flask of wine, a book of verse.

"And Thou beside me
singing in the wilderness.

"And wilderness is paradise enow."

More.

Look at this verse.

"The bird of time has but a little way.

"To fly."

Alexander the Great.
Yeah.

That's 2,200 years looking at you.

It is for me?
No.

Only half.

I had a silversmith tie it in two.

So half is for you
and half is for me.

Wherever you are in the world,

and wherever I might be,

this is proof
that we belong to each other.

And if one of us dies,
then the other keeps the whole coin.

Henry.

Gertrude Lowthian Bell,

will you marry me?

Did I hear you correctly?

Yes, marry me.
Will you marry me ?

Shouldn't you get down
on your knees?

Oh, no.

I did it wrong.

Yes.
Yes?

Alright, will you marry me?

I will.

Henry?

What are you doing?

How did you pass
the security guards with a ladder?

I know how to do
all the most important things in life.

But you could've fallen
into your daddy.

It was very important
that I solve a particular mystery.

What mystery?

Well, you see...

I love your smile.

But many men
in love with a woman's smile

have made the mistake
of marrying the whole girl.

Here's the whole girl.

I wonder
why my father hasn't answered me.

Don't worry,
there's always a delay

because the mail needs to be sorted
in the foreign office in London.

Two days ago I sent a telegram.

You sent a telegram?

From the embassy?

So... everyone knows about us?
No.

No, I only said:
"Have you sent an answer?"

And I've heard nothing.

Nothing from him.

I'm worried.

Can I help you?

From dispatch.
I don't have a telegram.

But I noticed that the mail woman
had this letter for you.

I knew you were waiting.

I'm always here for you.

I would...

I would...
Would what?

I would give my life
for a woman like you.

I shall return home,
I shall speak to my father.

Love is lawless. Don't go.

His credentials are not impressive.

I don't care.

Do you have any idea
how little the junior diplomat earns?

I could live in a tent - a tent! -
with the man I love.

What I have found out about him
and what you probably do not know...

I know everything.

What you probably do not know
is the man's a gambler.

He has accumulated significant debts.

And you had an enormous debt.

When you started your steel mill.
You did.

My answer remains no.
Why ?

I will not give my consent to this...

This childish plan.

<i>The nightingale with the drops
Of his heart's blood</i>

<i>Had nourished the red rose.</i>

<i>Then came the wind.</i>

<i>And catching at the boughs
in envious mood,</i>

<i>a hundred thorns
about his heart entwined.</i>

This just arrived by diplomatic pouch
from Tehran.

It says that the coin
and the clothes of Mr. Henry Cadogan

were found neatly arranged
on a rock by the river.

Cadogan's body was found
the following day

at the bottom of a cliff.

On the opposite side of the river.

The embassy regret to inform you
about this tragic accident.

It was no accident.

There's also
a short note from Cadogan,

which I hesitate to give to you.

Gertrude, I'll leave you now.

<i>Eternal love doth keep
In his complacent arms</i>

<i>The earth, the air, the deep.</i>

<i>Light of mine eyes
and harvest of my heart</i>

<i>And mine at last
in changeless memory</i>

<i>Ah! When he found it easy to depart</i>

<i>He left the harder pilgrimage to me</i>

<i>Oh Camel-driver
Though the cordage start</i>

<i>For God's sake
Help me lift the fallen load</i>

<i>And pity be my comrade of the road</i>

<i>My face is seamed with dust
Mine eyes are wet</i>

<i>Of dust and tears
The turquoise firmament</i>

<i>Kneadeth the bricks for joy's abode.
And yet,</i>

<i>I had not castled
And the time is gone.</i>

<i>What shall I play?</i>

<i>Upon the chequered floor
Of night and day</i>

<i>Death won the game.</i>

<i>For the first time in my life
I know who I am.</i>

<i>My heart belongs to no one now,
but the desert.</i>

For years.
Years ?

But why venturing out in the desert,
in times of war?

Have you ever experienced the desert?

What does that got to do with it?

What I would like to know is this:
what brings you here?

Why did you leave England for good,
as you say?

To be honest,
I did not fully understood myself.

But I did have my moment of epiphany.

Miss Bell, allow me to be candid.

This sounds pathetic.

And what are your intentions?

My intentions
are to move out there

and do some archaeological research.

Study the Bedouins.
The Bedouins?

This is not going to happen.

May I remind you
they're under Turkish administration.

Are you going
to ask for their permit?

No, and I'm not going
to ask for your permit either.

Do not forget one thing.

Do not forget that soon,
we intend to inherit their empire

I do not want trouble
for our ongoing efforts.

You will not
stir up confrontation with Turkey

because of the Bedouins.
They are feuding among themselves.

Now this little venture of yours
is counterproductive and dangerous.

You have no power to stop me.

You will not leave.

Yes, I will.

I have already been out there
and I'm going back.

Good day, gentlemen.

Ms. Bell, even if it costs me

to let the Turkish authorities know
about your plans,

they will intercept you.

This silly business of yours
is not going to happen!

Fattuh.
Yes, Ms. Bell.

Do you know and the rest of the men
know that we may all be arrested?

I'm prepared.

Even for that?

Fattuh is always prepared.

You are under arrest!

All of you are under arrest!

Lieutenant, is there something
I can help you with?

Who allowed you to leave
in the middle of the night,

without a permit
by the authorities?

There must be some misunderstanding...
We do have a permit.

You, who are you?
I'm Fattuh. The servant of Ms. Bell.

Ms. Gertrude Bell, I know who you are.
Do you have any weapons?

No. We do not.

This document comes directly...
It comes directly from Istanbul.

Directly from the ministry.

Ms. Bell, I'm so sorry.

I heard from our headquarters
in Amman...

A man probably just was not
notified by your government.

The ways of bureaucracy are labyrinthal.
It's always the same, even in London.

In our Foreign Office, so...

Is that so?
Yes. Yes.

Thank you, Lieutenant.

Your horses look like
they need some water.

Would you like to share
a moment with us?

Where did you get the permit?

I know this scribe
in the main mosque in Amman.

He can forge anything
for a good baksheesh.

Fattuh.

Lieutenant.

Did you come from the garrison
at the railway?

Yes, lady.

And how many cavalries
are stationed there?

About 60.

But their numbers are dwindling.

We were 100 in April.

Artillery?
All gone.

I should not tell you that.

I'm just a traveller
and a scientist.

Everyone knows
that the forces of the Ottoman Empire

are somewhat overstretched.

Besides, it's all officially
in the papers.

But my outpost is not in the papers.

Lieutenant.

I would like
to offer you a photograph.

You are very kind, lady Bell.

You and your men. Do you accept?
Yes, I'd like to.

Because I do not wish
to carry a military secret,

I'm going to give you
the exposed negative.

You can have it developed in Amman.
Thank you.

I would say right in the middle.

Yes.

The light is beautiful.

Over here.

Superb.

<i>Dear diary,</i>

<i>we have reached an oasis
that is something from a Bedouin fable.</i>

<i>The solitude of the desert
gives me consolation in my own solitude.</i>

<i>Fattuh asked me
why I always request two glasses of tea.</i>

<i>Should I tell him</i>

<i>this is for the man
who lives in my heart?</i>

<i>Day in, day out.
We keep moving ahead.</i>

<i>And setting up camp
is the same familiar routine.</i>

<i>But the deeper we immerse
ourselves into the desert</i>

<i>The more everything seems like a dream.</i>

<i>Some days we move across terrain
that is almost impassable.</i>

<i>Like the hard crust of salt,
like shards of broken porcelain.</i>

<i>Often I don't follow any map,
but merely go where my curiosity leads me.</i>

<i>East of the Dead Sea
I explored the hidden gorge of Wadi Mujib.</i>

<i>I never expected
to find water so fresh in the desert.</i>

<i>The deeper I penetrate
this mysterious labyrinth</i>

<i>The more I become known to myself</i>

<i>Near the end of the gorge,
Fattuh found something curious.</i>

<i>It turned out to be a Neolithic spear.</i>

<i>At least 10,000 years old.</i>

<i>I speculated
that in prehistoric times,</i>

<i>there must have been war here.</i>

<i>And that this must have been
a very defensible place.</i>

<i>But Fattuh said:
"This cannot be."</i>

<i>At such an early time,
the world was paradise.</i>

<i>And paradise is meant to come upon us
again if we leave a righteous life.</i>

<i>As foretold by the Prophet.</i>

<i>Paradise has no time,
no age, no dwelling place.</i>

<i>It awaits us.</i>

<i>This made me eager
to go deeper into archaeology.</i>

<i>Not far from the gorge
is the British excavation site of Petra.</i>

<i>It was a hard day's travel
because of the arrival of early rain.</i>

Greetings.

Welcome, Ms. Bell!

Welcome to our home!

I'm Campbell Thompson.
This is my colleague, T.E. Lawrence.

And what does "T.E." stand for?

T.E. stands for Edward Thomas.

I despise both names.
They're an abomination.

Please just call me Lawrence.
Will do, Lawrence.

We knew you were coming.

Really? We didn't send messengers.

A meeting of the stars
saw you at night,

and during the day,
the sand down your footsteps.

Sorry, he's always like this.

What's a school boy like you
doing here, Lawrence?

This particular school boy
has a Ph.D. in archaeology.

Thompson...

I have a Ph.D.
in medieval pottery shards.

It follows me around like
the wafting of an old spinster's fart.

How I long to be rid of it!

Shall we?

This place is a dump.

Everything has been moved
by grave robbers.

Over and over again.

We're simply stuck here.

Lawrence dreams of great treasures,
hoards of gold.

At least...

God Almighty, give us
a library of Babylonian clay tablets

the likes that the Germans
have excavated in Mesopotamia.

Our excavation methods
are no match for theirs.

This is true, Gertrude, darling.

"Darling".

You know, I made a big mistake
wearing this belt here.

That kind of belt
is only worn by bachelors.

And...?

And... the local excavation workers

have been trying to find me a wife.

Imagine. A wife for me.
How horrible!

But they heard of your arrival

and instant rumour spread
that you're my bride,

sent from England.

I'm not sure the right man for you
had been born yet.

To me, the Ottoman Empire
can't last much longer

and it looks like the Roman Empire
shall disappear before its collapse.

What do you think's gonna happen?

Chaos.

Chaos and war.

Maybe the British Empire
will take over

and  fill the void of power?
No, I beg to differ.

I believe it with the Arabs who's a spirited nation
it will emerge.

They are the future.

Perhaps, but...

Any meaningful change
may take centuries to launch.

It will happen in our lifetime...
Enough politics.

Or in a few decades.

We are archaeologists.

So far, I am only a traveller.

Well then, to the travellers.

And to those who dig up mysteries
from under the surface.

I'm sorry, we have no glasses.

You know what, Gertrude?

Regardless of what anyone says,

under the benign,
soft glove of camp fire

with good scotch in your fist,

you'd make an terrific bride.

Gertie!

You had breakfast yet?

Got a hangover.

I have a Roman Empire size headache.

What a shame
we do not have Rome set on fire

and Nero singing to us live.
I've been moaning the conflagration.

He himself started the fire
under the right mood.

Those were the good days.
Lawrence, keep it down.

Gertie.

You can't leave.

The local women might try
to find me a wife.

Do you want me to kiss you
in front of everyone?

Absolutely.

My kiss...

My kiss shall liberate you.

Wonderful!

Gertie...

would you, please, not marry me?

Absolutely.

Please, do come in.

Ms. Bell, the consul.

Ms. Bell... welcome!

Welcome back!

Before we talk business,
allow me to congratulate you

on your feat of alluding
the Turkish authorities.

Well, I had a permit,
if you know what I mean.

How did you forge it?

It wasn't me, it was a scribe
from the Great Mosque.

One of the finest.

Yes, it was my servant
who contacted him.

I'm sure if you ever needed
a document, we could arrange.

The British Empire has no need
for such petty tricks.

No.

Except for printing millions
of counterfeit Deutsch marks

and Turkish piasters,
in order to undermine their economies.

Please, take a seat.

Well...

I'm here to inform you of my plans
to travel to Jabal Al-Druze.

You can't be serious.

Yes, I most certainly am.

No one has travelled
to the Druze in decades.

So it's about time.

No British soldier will accompany you,
Ms. Bell.

It'd mean a provocation
for the Druze people.

I myself as a soldier...
Major...

Major of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

Ms. Bell, we seem to know quite a lot
about each other already.

Major...

I'm here to ask you for what you're already
so graciously volunteering.

Even if you do not hear from me
for several months

pay no attention and send no one.

The Druze will take you for a spy.
Yeah, or maybe I am.

Maybe I am a spy,
but I am a spy for no one.

No one but myself.

I am the consul's wife.

Yes.
Don't be so formal, dear.

Ms. Bell, this is Judith. Welcome.

I brought you a present.

One for each of you.

This is very kind.

It's just something I found in a souk.

What do I do with it?
That's beautiful.

My love, use them in the kitchen
for your onions.

Come.

But the Druze are fiercely independent.

And more than anything, anti-Turkish.

In fact, they're the only people ever
to have defeated the Turks.

Ans this is what makes them
so interesting.

Besides, their faith incorporates
Christian, Gnostic, Neoplatonic,

which overlay their Islamic beliefs.

Please, let's not talk about Plato.

Would you like
some more of the couscous?

We're not talking about Plato,
my love.

We're talking about a very grave danger:
Ms. Bell's faith.

It will be worthwhile.

Be careful.

The Druze do not play the game
as it should be played.

They go out to slay,
and they spare no one.

While they have enough
dry powder in their flasks,

and strength to pull the trigger,

they kill every man,
woman and child they encounter.

How awful!

What?
I want you to have them.

No...

No, it's too much.

Dear...

Have you no said on several occasions
you would never give these pistols away?

Well...

Now they are, given away.

Ms. Bell, for you.

For me?

<i>We are travelling across
the vast expanse of Bedouin lands.</i>

<i>And my eyes are opening
to the complexity</i>

<i>of tribal relations here.</i>

<i>Fattuh has been my gracious teacher
in all of this.</i>

<i>He says the most volatile conflict
is between the Druze and the Beni Sakhr.</i>

My worry is Omar, Ms. Bell.

Yes, I only found out this morning
that he was Beni Sakhr.

Should we leave him behind?

There's no mercy
between Druze and Beni Sakhr.

If two of them meet, only one survives.

Ms. Bell!

Yes.

I realized that the Druze
would recognize Omar as a Beni Sakhr

by his accent.

I did not think about that.

What do we do?

Ask Omar.

Omar, should I send you back
before it's too late?

Omar suddenly became a deaf-mute.

When?

An hour ago.

You are my prisoners, you'll die!

All of you!
If I die...

it should be
at the hands of your sheik.

Where's your sheik?
Take me to him.

Ms. Bell, you're wounded!
Nothing.

Nothing.
Give me your sheik now!

Now!

A woman passes through the entrance
at the women's side.

This woman is joining the men.

Sit down.

Sit down, woman.

Please.

Who are you to dare come here?

I'm Gertrude Bell.

And I am a subject
of the British Empire.

Thank the Almighty
that you're not German.

Have a seat, please.

I thank him every day that I am not.

Are you a spy?
No.

I'm a writer.

I write about the beauty of the land
and its people.

So, you're a poet.

In a way, but in fact,
I do not describe...

what I see...

I just name its beauty.

Much in the vein of the...

Roman poet Virgil.

He's an Aeneid.

Yes.

I'm so sorry, but how does the sheik
of the Druze know about Virgil?

I have travelled... incognito.

I've been to Damascus.

To Beirut.

To Paris.

Les Champs-Elysées,
la plus belle avenue Du monde.

Baudelaire...

Et ses "Fleurs Du mal". Rimbaud.

You're right,
this poet never describes anything.

He just names
the glory of the trees,

the beehives...

and the life in the country.

He's like our poets.

This is true.

May I ask in
one of my trusted men?

Please do.

Fattuh...

would you fetch me my wooden case?

Ms. Bell...

I hope my men didn't hurt you.

They did, but it is a small wound.
It is what we call grace.

Forgive them.

They know no better.

I'm sorry.

I want like to give you a gift.

It is something very precious to me
and it was given to me. And now,

now, it is yours.

Exquisite!

Stay as my guest.

You are under the protection
of our hospitality.

Good to have you back.

A noble bow wound... but alive.

Please, it's nothing. Nothing.

But I have to admit something.

I gave away your pistols
They were not mine, but yours.

But you gave them to me.

Finally, it became useful.
It was the purpose.

I'm sorry.
Ms. Bell,

will you please keep quiet?
Finally, something happened.

Bullets.

Now I have a new plan,
I want to go to Hayri.

But it is the middle of the Arabian desert.
It's the forbidden zone.

We have only a few reports
from some travellers in the 1950's.

Why for God's sake Hayri?

Because it is the secret epicentre
of the Arab world

and I want to meet the emir Ibn Rashid.

He is important
He is the leader of Arabia.

Who would be with you?
Fattuh.

And my men.

What? I trust them.

You arrived too early.

Want me to come back later?
No.

No, no, no.

What's going on?

This stallion is for you.
For me ?

You'll need the best horse in Arabia.

But you're painting it!
I've never seen anything like it.

Well...

Well, what?
I have to make a confession.

I stole him for you!

You stole this horse for me?

See what he can do.

Bravo!

Bravo, Salhadin.

Bravo.

I didn't exactly steal him,
it was more an act of expropriation.

 Where? From who?
From the Turkish authorities.

From the enemy, so to speak.

How?

Well, there were  two things I did.

I paid off an editor
of a local newspaper

to write about a disease
spreading among the horses.

Then I took on
a false credentials as a vet,

I went straight to the Turkish garrison,
I inspected the horses

and this here stallion here
had to be removed immediately.

And I put him straight
into quarantine.

So, His Excellency,
the British consul

Richard Doughty-Wylie...
I've stolen a horse for you.

Ms. Bell.

I have summoned you and I...
No one summons me.

I have... invited you.

That sounds vaguely better.

Yes. Let's get straight to the point,
shall we?

You ventured out,
and I felt not inclined to support this.

To put it mildly.

With the size and momentum
of the Great War that is gaining,

it'd be of considerable value
for our country

if you could make your curiosity
more... systematic.

Meaning what?

You would be our only spy

in a vast area
we have little intelligence about.

In short... no.

A blunt no.
Correct. A blunt no.

I operate for no one.

What is it then that attracts you
to the Bedouin out there?

It is something that you and your world
would never understand.

It's their freedom.

It's their dignity.

It's their poetry of life.

Have a good day.

Mr. Wylie!

Richard. Please say Richard.

Richard...

I'm not ready.

I would never be with...

You would never what?

I would never be with a man again.

Because...

I lost a man.

Lost?
Yes.

I'm a widow.

A widow?

Yes! No, no...

Sort of.

What a clumsy fool I've been.
No, it's...

Will you forgive me?

Of course.

Well...

What else do we need?

Quinine, and antidote against scorpions.

Scorpions, no. We'll be watchful.

No Bedouin has ever been stung,
am I right?

Yes, ma'am. As you wish.

This market has everything we need.

Mosquito net, a folding bed,
a bathtub.

We need this.

The lady has a good eye.

I assure you they are the best.

I have confession to make.
A confession?

Yes.

As wonderful as the horse was,

it'd never have made it
in the dunes of the desert.

What did you do?

I traded it.
Fattuh traded it in the market place.

For four of the very best dromedaries.
There they are.

I'm sorry.

Gertrude, don't leave. Not now.

Richard, I have no choice.

My heart is not ready.

I can feel that.

Stay for just a few more weeks.
No, it's late December.

Very soon,
the dessert won't be possible.

I'm longing for you.
Please do not say that.

Do not say these things.

It'll all be lonely without you.
You have a wife.

It is the most unbearable loneliness
to be married unhappily.

This comes at me
from nowhere, Richard.

Besides, I could never fully be yours.
You're a married man.

I'll settle everything.

Will you write to me?

I'll write you
from every post office in the desert.

I'll keep a diary for you.

The wind...

What?

The wind is coming with sand.

Can the lady show me how to do it?

To cook an egg?

The desert knows no eggs.
The desert knows no hens.

You boil it for 5 minutes.

The desert knows no minutes.

The length of a prayer.

You have a present.

<i>Richard...</i>

<i>I'm trying
to keep you out of my thoughts,</i>

<i>but it's strange.</i>

<i>You are on my mind
in every step of the desert.</i>

<i>My cook does not have
a notion of time.</i>

<i>He's never boiled an egg.</i>

<i>Already I've dropped back in the desert
as if it were my own place.</i>

<i>Silence and solitude fowling around me
like an impenetrable veil.</i>

<i>Sleep more profound
than civilization can thrive.</i>

<i>And then the roadless desert.</i>

<i>Again.</i>

Before the tribal wars,
this place was alive.

Now there are only ghosts here.

What is this?

How is this possible?

Is it from the consul?

The consul's messenger
must have been riding day and night.

We shall stay here tonight.

<i>My beloved,</i>

<i>the desert has you
and my heart is with you.</i>

<i>If I was free
and a very perfect night,</i>

<i>it's be more fitting
to take you and kiss you.</i>

<i>God seems to have joined us
for some divine moment.</i>

<i>Ah, the ecstasy!</i>

<i>We might reach it again,</i>

<i>on an outpost of time.</i>

<i>I can't sleep... I can't sleep.</i>

<i>It is one in the morning.</i>

<i>You and you and you
are between me and any rest.</i>

<i>You once called me life.</i>

<i>And fire. I flame and I'm consumed.</i>

<i>There is a voice in me
I try to chase away. It says...</i>

<i>"Before all other world,
claim me and take me."</i>

<i>And yet...</i>

<i>Richard...</i>

<i>I doubt there is anyone in the world
so happy as I am now.</i>

<i>You were baptised in the desert</i>

<i>and there is
no another salvation for you.</i>

<i>When we are on the move, I feel</i>

<i>everything is behind us.</i>

<i>Only our shadows follow.</i>

<i>As if to remind us</i>

<i>of our past lives.</i>

The lady is bold,
as bold as any Bedouin man.

Is your destination Hayri?
It is.

I want to meet bin Rashid.

We have to talk a lot
about bin Rashid.

It has powerful enemies.

Ibn Saud?

Yes, and many others.

You will not find him in Hayri.
Where is he ?

He's at war in the South.

I thought he was at peace.

Not any longer. Beware of Hayri.
There is a lot of murdering going on.

For me?
Yes.

You've shown me
such gratuitous hospitality.

And you have entertained me
with wonderful desert stories.

Every Bedouin is a storyteller.

But you have also given insight
into the tribes and the tribes of Hayri.

And for that...
I want to thank you.

I would like to give you these.

These are my binoculars.

I can see clearly now,
so I do not need him.

These are a gift.

I've become a desert traveller
who is very rich.

Thank you.

And my guide, Ahmed,
will be your escort.

No harm will be done to you
on your way.

But once in Hayri, no one gets out.

Inshallah.
We want to see you again... alive.

Inshallah.

You can see very far.

Slaves, I don't know exactly
what this means.

But it's an insult, I'm sure.

Only the woman.

Men will stay behind.

Only the woman is invited here.

My name is Ibrahim.

I am Fatima, the aunt of the emir.

This is Turkia,
who will entertain you.

Welcome to Hayri.

You must be the Lady of the desert.

Rumour has been faster
than your camels.

I'm Gertrude Bell.

Who has sent you?

No one.

No, I'm here on my own.

On your own?

I know the world.

I come from Istanbul.

The Sultan has sent me as a gift
to Emir Rashid.

What are your plans?

I would like to meet Emir Rashid.

Emir Rashid has been driven off Hayri.

His women followed him.

And all tribe's men.

But he left me behind.

He was a guest of the Emir?
Yes.

The Emir Harrud, six years ago.

What happened?

This palace is full of conspiracies.

Full of murder.

What happened to the Emir?

He was assassinated.

And his successor was murdered.
And his successor as well.

All of them, a few years.

The Eunuchs were killed with them

and the entire harem was passed
from man to man to man.

Who is the ruling Emir now?

There was hardly anyone left
in his family.

So, he's young.

He's raiding in the North.

Fatima, his aunt,

is the true ruler.
She is the real Emir.

It's beautiful.

I have been a prisoner here
for three weeks now.

You are not a prisoner.

Your men are taken care well.

You are only required to stay
until the Emir decides.

Decides what?

If it would be good
to have you here.

For what?

My wish is to keep you here,
in the harem of the Emir.

He would be delighted.

Fatima...

That is not my wish.

When does he get back?

Do you know?

I am delighted to greet my guest.

He means:
"I am delighted to greet his wife

"into my harem."

Yes, my wife.

Emir...

It is an honour to meet you.

However, I am already married.

I am a member of the British Consul.

And this will cause a problem
both for a man and his country.

I was told otherwise.

"No man ever touches a married woman",

the Prophet, peace be upon him,
has taught us.

<i>Dear Richard,
it's clear from what I've seen</i>

<i>that the house of Rashid
is moving towards its demise.</i>

<i>It now appears that
Ibn Fold'star is in the ascendant.</i>

<i>And the future of Central Arabia
lies with him,</i>

<i>not the people of Hayri.</i>

<i>I should communicate this
to the British Arab Bureau.</i>

<i>The explorations that I have undertaken
these past years,</i>

<i>the terrains and its people
of tribal life and governments,</i>

<i>have culminated in a unique picture,
one that only I can paint.</i>

<i>As for myself, I sense that
long years of preparation,</i>

<i>preparation for what I do not know,
have ended.</i>

<i>And a new destiny</i>

<i>is unfolding before me.</i>

<i>I have only now to return to you.</i>

Let's find somewhere quiet.

I've read your diary.

It was meant for you.

The world is changing.

While I was in the desert,
the war turned into a World Wide War

and I didn't even notice.

All of Europe now.

Russia, Japan...

And America now.
They will have it too.

Gertrude, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

I have re-enlisted for active service.

I expected it.

The moment I'm back from war,

I shall put everything in order
with Judith.

Thus should be free.

I'd rather put a bullet in my head...

than live without you.

Why do you say that?

Gertrude...

There is something you should know.

Judith has been making
ominous remarks about...

about committing suicide
if I should try to divorce her.

I see.

I do not believe it, but...

Love is a tyrant.

Gertie... Oriental secretary.
Congratulations.

It's as if they invented
the post foil.

All this is your staff?
It is.

You have become senior advisor,
Lawrence.

You've morphed into a political animal.

Technically, I'm onto you, but...
What?

There are no men like me
and no women like you, of course.

You've become some kind of queen.

No, just a woman
who misses her man.

You mean your officer
who joined the glorious war.

Yes, I do.

Miss Bell... could you get closer, please?
We'd like to get

the Giza Pyramids in the frame.
Mr Churchill!

Still, please.

Mr. Churchill, what are you expecting
from the conference?

Boys, let's face it...

a new order in the Arab World.

Mr. Churchill, with this new emphasis
on the Middle East,

where does that leave off policy
towards British India?

Churchill has tried to sell this
as a new achievement of the British Empire.

What else is it?
Come on, Lawrence.

We are not leading them
towards autonomy.

It's the Arab nations who are awakening.
This is their achievement.

Of course.

The Lions of the British Empire.

Mr Lawrence, over this way please.

The pyramids in the background,
for the photographers. Gentlemen...

You're having a shot.
A little to the left, sir.

Hold tight, Mr. Lawrence.

Gentlemen, are we getting this camp?
The shot is marvellous.

Mister Lawrence!

Marvellous. Boys,
are you getting this?

One more like that,
please, Mr. Churchill.

My cigar... my cigar went out.

That is the end of the world.

One more, Mr. Churchill.
You're all looking splendid.

4,000 years of history upon you.

Lawrence, shut up.

Napoleon said that before you.

Yes, all together now. Excellent!

Our losses at Gallipoli are staggering.

and the Australian expedition force
has lost 30,000 men in one single day.

General, this is classified.

I don't care. By tomorrow,
the whole world will shout of its window.

Doughty-Wylie ,
who led the assault,

has already been awarded
the Victoria Cross.

Did you said Richard?

Richard Doughty-Wylie ?

Royal Welch Fusiliers.

The Victoria Cross is only
for fallen heroes.

Correct.

We were told
he was seeking death in combat.

I think he has problems
with his wife.

Yes.

Excuse me. Thank you.

Fattuh,
what I'd do without you?

I shall follow the lady
to the end of the world.

<i>Dear diary...</i>

<i>in the afflictions of my heart,
I am turning to you.</i>

<i>It is as if my life is ended,</i>

<i>as if love was not meant for me.</i>

<i>And only the great task
I have shoulded keeps me going.</i>

<i>Cairo has became
one of the centres of the world again.</i>

<i>And I'm starting a new life.</i>

<i>The life of a politician.</i>

Gertrude...

Prince Faisal has requested
a meeting with you.

He seems to be everywhere.

How does the third son of Sharif Hussein
deal with his brothers?

His brothers are only interested
in horse racing.

Gertrude,
we have to play the game.

Faisal is shrewd,
he's cunning, he's ruthless.

But he seems to be the right one
for this time in history.

Let's be sincere...
It's dangerous to be sincere.

Unless you're also stupid.

England needs to get out its colonies
sooner rather than later.

I tremble for my country
when I reflect that God is just.

My brother Faisal and I have read
your memorandum on the Arab war.

Congratulations.

You do express our feelings.

No one in the Western world knows
the heart of a Bedouin better than you.

The Bedouins call you...

"the noble lady".

I am honoured.

And we agree with those who call you
"the mother of the faitful".

A title given to the wife of the Prophet,
peace upon him.

In the face of two direct descendants
of the Prophet

and in the face
of the people of the desert,

I am not worthy of that honour.

Your falcon's...
Your falcon's worthy of a king.

You will soon be king.

Over whom?

Over the people I love.

What makes an English woman
love us so much?

I have a trusted man, from Homs.

He is...

Well, he saved my life.

Many, many times in the desert.

He has an old mother
and when she speaks to him,

she has five sons - she says...

Fattuh...

Fattuh, whom I entrust to bury me.

And then she speaks of the weather,

she speaks of the God and...

and for that alone... for him...

you will always have my heart.

And now, with your permission,
I will leave.

Go in peace.

How could she know
that we will be kings?

She is the maker of kings.

She is the crowned queen of the desert.
