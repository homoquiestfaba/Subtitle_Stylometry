â™ª She said it's hard times

â™ª You should pull
yourself together â™ª

â™ª And she walked out

â™ª The door

â™ª And my life

â™ª It's like a dog
without a master â™ª

â™ª And I'm free

OK.

â™ª Trying harder just to
stay above the water â™ª

â™ª When it's smarter
just to let it go â™ª

â™ª But you're keeping me afloat â™ª

â™ª I said you're
keeping me afloat â™ª

â™ª It gets better if we
pull ourselves together â™ª

â™ª Never seem to let it go

â™ª Cause you're
keeping me afloat â™ª

Hello?

Oh, hi, hi! I'll be right there.

Oh, please work.

Thank you.

â™ª Well, it's blue skies

â™ª And it leads you
in behind me â™ª

â™ª As I go on my way

Just leave me alone.

Come on, Dina, I'm
just trying to help.

Since when?

You're no better than
the rest of them.

Look, can we just talk?

I know this has
been rough on you.

Do you?

You don't care how
I feel, you...

made that crystal clear.

â™ª And we never seem
to let it go â™ª

â™ª Cause you're
keeping me afloat â™ª

â™ª Keeping me afloat
Keeping me afloat â™ª

â™ª Keeping me afloat
Keeping me afloat â™ª

So we'll start with the most
important room in the whole house.

This is the kitchen,

and it was completely remodeled
about five years ago.

And as you can see they put
in beautiful cherry cabinets,

that I love, and these cute
tile accents in the backsplash,

and the, um...

open floor plan
for entertaining.

Uh... what else?

The neighborhood is wonderful,

and the schools are fantastic.

My daughter Dina plays for the
varsity field hockey team,

and she just got
recruited by Price.

I'm a proud mom, so I brag.

She got a scholarship
and everything.

Do you guys have kids?

Mom?

OK. Oh!

Damn it!

Damn it!

That's it.

I wish I could just...

fast forward my life.

See how this all turns out.

If I actually make it through.

Stop dripping.

Anyway...

I can't... I can't
do this right now.

Dina?

Hey, sweetie. I'm home.

Sorry, I know.

I know, I'm late again.

Thought I was gonna get
a speeding ticket.

I tried.

Oh.

You didn't want Chinese?

Well, if you're lucky,
I'll cook pasta.

If you're lucky, we can order
in from somewhere else.

Sweetie?

Oh, come on.

Dina!

I'm starving.

Come on, girls.

That's it, stay together.
Work together.

All right, Dina.

Great shot!

That's what I'm talking about!
Nice!

Good job, girls. Nice teamwork.

All right, let's line it up.

Let's hustle!

Sub!

Claire, you're up.

You OK, Dina?

Oh, fine. Just my ankle. I
just gotta re-tape it again.

All right, good job.
Thanks.

Let's line it up! Hustle!

Owww!

Hi.

Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

I rushed. All right.

How we doing?
It's a close game.

It's 2-1, they're
playing really good,

but this other
team is very good.

Oh, God, Skylar's playing great.

She is, she's kinda
keeping us in the game.

She's killin' it.

Where's Dina?

Oh, uh... she's on the bench.

Ankle?
Yep.

Don't worry, they're taping it.

Come on, Skylar!

Concentrate!

She's doing all right.

I spent all that money
on that summer clinic,

and she cannot keep
her stick down.

Hey. Congratulations
about Price.

I'm really thrilled for her.

It's a good thing.
I am too.

It's good. It's so good.

How about Sky, how she's doing?

Oh. Make up your mind!
Oh, she will.

She will, but she's
taking her time

and it's making me a little...

She's got time. Ah,
she's a good girl.

Yeah, she does.
Hey, Mrs. Reid.

Oh, my God, Mrs. V. Did
you see Dina's goal?

I did.

Mom, can we give
Claire a ride home?

No. Yes, get in.

We always give her a ride home.

Bye, Sky.
- Good game, Sky.

Thanks, you too. I'll
see you tomorrow.

Hey. I'm proud of you.

Thanks, Mom.

Needless to say, this has
been a difficult year.

But for our team, a
very successful one.

Twelve and three.
And the league MVP,

Skylar Reid.

Congratulations.

Well done.
Thanks.

And congrats on your early
acceptance to Price as well,

that is very good news.

Now I would like to award the
individual varsity letters.

If there's anything you need.
I mean...

Anything at all.

First, I would like to award

a posthumous varsity letter.

To Dina Van Cleve.

Her mother, Rachel, is here
to receive Dina's letter.

Rachel. Hang on for a sec.

I'm sorry, this was too soon.

The team wanted
you to have this.

Skylar had all the girls
sign their names.

Oh, sweetie.

I am so sorry.

If there's anything
that I can do...

Thank you. Thank you.

â™ª I can see this takes a toll â™ª

â™ª On you, girl

â™ª You're givin' your
heart and soul â™ª

â™ª To fix your world

â™ª I know that I'm
pulling you down â™ª

â™ª I float above

â™ª You say you're
looking for a sign â™ª

â™ª That I'm OK Well, love â™ª

â™ª Just know

â™ª I can hear you

â™ª But now it's time
to start anew â™ª

â™ª I'm in a new place
and from up high â™ª

â™ª See the world so clear

â™ª But I didn't get
to say goodbye â™ª

â™ª Oh, how I long
to hold you near â™ª

â™ª I want you to know
I'm all right â™ª

â™ª I tried to dry the tears

â™ª But to help you
now it's time â™ª

â™ª I disappear

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah

â™ª I disappear

â™ª Whoa, whoa, whoa â™ª

Where do I start?

My friend, Claire...

she always flips to the last page
of the book before she reads it.

She says she doesn't want to
waste her time on a story

if it ends badly.

I guess she'd tell
me to start there.

She would...

if we were still speaking.

I've spent the past
few weeks being...

absolutely tortured

by the people that I
used to call my friends.

They...

I can't... I can't
do this right now.

North Carolina?

Jealous, Van Cleve?

It's better in high res.

Who is this?

Hello?

Do you think it's funny
sending filth like this

to my daughter's phone?
What? No, I...

Who is this? What is your name?

Valerie.
Valerie who?

I played field hockey
with Dina last year.

Look, Mrs. Van Cleve,

Dina didn't know I was gonna
send her that, I swear.

So, please don't be mad at her.

Anyway, I'm really sorry.

Could you just let her know
that I'm back in town.

We should talk.

Oh, my God.

I had no idea.

I think... Dina was
being harassed

at school before she died.

So when I saw the
picture you sent,

I automatically assumed it was you.
I'm sorry.

Of course.

God, I feel like such an idiot.

Did she ever say
anything to you?

About feeling like she was
being bullied at school?

We haven't talked in awhile.

I just got back from a
semester in South Africa.

I've been unplugged for months.

Are you close with
any of her friends?

Not really.

I mean, I know some of
them from the team.

I want to understand

what she went through.

But honestly, I...

I don't even know
where to start.

Have you tried looking online?

I mean, if she had a falling
out with her friends

it's probably
catalogued somewhere.

These days, most dirty laundry

is offered up for
public consumption.

Would I still be able to
find it after all this time?

The Internet never forgets.

When was the first time you
thought something might be wrong?

Homecoming.

OK, everybody get together.
- Everybody smile.

Skylar, honey, stand up straight.
- Bigger teeth.

All right. Oh, God, they're beautiful.
They're stunning.

One, two, three.
- Wait, you guys get in a little closer.

Homecoming!

Smile!
Big smiles.

Perfect.

Good?
Done yet?

Very pretty.

Get outta here!
Have a great time.

Wait, wait.

You look beautiful.

Thank you very much.

Now, can you fit everything you
need in that little bitty purse?

Like money and ID?

Well, I am not driving
and I can't buy alcohol.

Or drink yet.

So, listen, I went
to high school once.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

And I know that there's
a lot of pressure

on a night like tonight.

And people have... wait.

People have expectations,

and I'm just trying to tell
you that you don't ever,

ever have to do anything you're not
100 percent comfortable doing.

Like the Electric Slide?

Come on, Mama, you can save the PSA.
Mm-hmm.

It's just gonna be some
friends hanging out.

Making a lifetime of memories.

Good, clean fun.
Love you.

Love you too.
Bye.

Bye.
Have fun.

OK, one more, one more.
Take a picture.

Pretty.

All right, let's take
one of you and I.

â™ª I'll still follow you

â™ª I will follow you

â™ª And you say look
up, look up... â™ª

Wait, wait, hold on...

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Can we just slow down for a sec?

How slow are we talking?

Really, really, really slow.

I'm sorry.

You said Homecoming
would be the night.

I know, I...
I got you flowers.

I got us this room at
the Beechwood, which...

wasn't cheap.

I know, I just...

I thought I would be
ready, but I'm...

I'm just not. I'm sorry.

So, now what?

Maybe you should
just take me home.

You know, it's not
that big of a deal.

Yeah, well...

Maybe it should be, Mark.

â™ª You fearless beauty
breaks your fall â™ª

â™ª Something in me knows

â™ª There's something
more than this â™ª

â™ª So close I wanna run

You spent all that time
lobbying for an extra 2 hours

and you're home before midnight.

Yeah, the dance ended at ten.

Rest of the night was
kinda uneventful.

Sweetie?
Yeah?

Did you win Homecoming Queen?

Yeah.

That's fantastic!
Congratulations.

It's not that big
of a deal, Mom.

It is a big deal.

Oh, my God. When I was your age,

it was like the
biggest deal ever.

Seriously, they had
posters and pins

and cupcake bribes.

I swear, it was like a
presidential election.

Except possibly for the cupcake
part cause that would be odd.

So, something happened
with Mark, didn't it?

Why would you say that?

I can tell.

Did you...

You know.

Mom, no!

You can talk to me
about stuff like that.

Well, I don't want to talk to
you about my sex life, so...

Are you telling me that
you have a sex life?

No, that's not what I'm saying,

I just...

Will you please just get out?

OK, I'm going.

But...

I'm around if you need me.

I'm always around
if you need me.

You know that, right?

Yes, I know.

All right. I love you.
Have a good night.

I will. You too.

I'm so proud of you.

Thank you so much.

See you in the morning.

â™ª No, I don't care that
you can't read my mind â™ª

There you guys are.

Mark, where the
hell have you been?

Hey.
Here's a beer, dude.

Come on.
Oh, yeah.

No pictures, douchebag.

â™ª I gotta have it when you
roll just like this â™ª

â™ª When she walked
into the room â™ª

â™ª I got addicted to
my point of view â™ª

â™ª And now I can't stop

â™ª Hey - â™ª And I won't stop

Hey!

Who's that?

No one.

OK, good.

Come with me, I'll
show you something.

Excuse me. Come on.

All right, what did
you want to show me?

This.

Hot mama!

Come on, take it off, girl.

Claire, what the
hell's going on?

Everyone in the school
has seen your picture.

Oh, my God. Where are you
getting those from?!

I don't know. I got it from
like ten different people.

What? Oh, my... Just come here!

What am I gonna do?!

What am I...

OK, OK, just breathe.
Dina, Dina, breathe.

OK, we can figure
this out together.

We can figure it out.

Oh, God.

I need a pen.
What?

I need a pen!

How could you do that to me?

I thought we meant
something to each other.

Shouldn't that be my line?
Excuse me?

First you blow me off at
Homecoming and now this?

I don't get you.

No, no. I sent that picture
to you and you alone,

and now it is all
over the school.

I just saw it this morning when a
bunch of people showed it to me.

Stop lying. Seriously, why
did you send it out...

Dina. I got a new
wallpaper today.

You know, it's really hot.

I'm thinking I should send
it in to Sexysexters.com.

What do you think?

Oh, God...

I'd like the opportunity to speak
with each of these students.

I have some questions
for them about Dina.

And you think they'll be
able to give you answers?

Yeah, well as founding members of the
"Dina Van Cleve is a Slut" Facebook page,

I'm thinking they
might have a few.

Katie Bishop.

Michael Hatcher.

Peter Lambert.

I can't help you.

You can't help me, or
you won't help me?

Can't. They don't
go to school here.

Of course they go to school
here, how can they not?

Dummy accounts.

It's common with cyber bullying.
It's a way to remain anonymous.

OK... Well, you monitor computer
activity in the school, right?

Can't I tell who had
access to the page?

Mrs. Van Cleve,

what is it that you're
hoping to do with this?

These kids hurt my daughter.

I want to know why they did it,
I want to know who it was.

Dina's death was a tragedy.

And we all want closure.

But I can't have you turning
my school upside down.

If you need something,
you get it through me.

Fine. Good. I need the ISP
records from the computer labs.

You won't find anything there.

Mrs. Van Cleve, please. Think
about what you are doing.

This is a can of worms
you do not want to open.

Um, I'm here if
you want to talk.

Oh, are you?

Mark, hi.

Can I talk to you
for just a second?

Yeah, um, but I only have a few
minutes until my next class.

It's OK. It's all right.

What do you know about this?

Did Dina send it to you?

Yeah, she did.

Who did you send it to?

No one.

You're trying to tell me
that nobody saw this?

Who did you send it to?

Look, I didn't do it. And I
don't know anything about it.

Mark, please, I know
you care about her.

Please tell me how this got out.

Look, I'm sorry about Dina.

I really am.

I don't know what to tell you.

I'm late for my class.

Claire.

Hi, Mrs. V.

Hi. Hi.

I wanted to talk to
you for a second.

If I can, about something.
Is that all right?

Sure... What?

I want you to help me understand
why Dina did what she did.

Oh, Mrs. V.

I really miss her. But...

I found a video that Dina
was making on the computer.

And in it, she talks pretty
intimately about what was

going on at school
before she died.

This video seemed like it was the
last in a series she was making.

Like it was some kind
of diary or something.

Do you know anything about this?

Sure, I knew that she
made a few of those.

Sometimes she'd even post
them online and stuff,

depending on what
she had to say.

Where can I find them?

She took down her page a
few days before she...

Before.

Claire?

Please help me with this.

Dina...

Well, she wouldn't talk to me.

About what she was
going through.

I really feel like she
wanted to protect me.

But, if she confided
in those videos...

I need to see them.

I need to understand this.

I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I'm sorry.

Why weren't the two of
you speaking, Claire?

I don't know what...

She talked about
it in the video.

Some dumb fight, I guess.

I don't remember.

What else does she say?

If you think of anywhere I
might be able to find them,

will you call me?
Will you do that?

I'm gonna keep
looking on my end.

Claire, seriously?

Can you get, like a poker
face or something?

I don't even know
what that means.

Oh, my God. OK. It means
this is really important

so I'm going to need you
to pull it together.

OK.

Claire. I'm trusting you.

I got it covered, OK?

Hi.

Hi, Mrs. V.

I thought I'd come see if we can
find any more of Dina's vlogs.

Thank you.

My friend, Claire...

she always flips to the last page
of the book before she reads it.

She says she doesn't want to
waste her time on a story

if it ends badly.

I guess she'd tell
me to start there.

She would...

if we were still speaking.

I've spent the past
few weeks being...

absolutely tortured

by the people that I
used to call my friends.

They...

I can't... I can't
do this right now.

It's not easy to watch, is it?

I've seen it so many
times, I think I'm numb.

Who's she talking about, Claire?

I don't know.

I've seen the text.

I'll dig around on there
and see what I can find.

OK. I'll be right back.

Thank you.

Hi, may I please speak
to Bob Montgomery?

Bob, hi, my name is
Rachel Van Cleve.

And I wrote an article about
bullying in our high school

and how I think the
administration is covering it up.

And I think it would make a
really good op-ed piece.

Great, OK. I'll proof it and
then I'll send it over.

OK.

Thanks. Bye.

Did you find anything?

No, nothing.

I searched the
entire hard drive.

I did too.

Why would she do this?

Why would she just
leave one file?

So, you have seen this?

Yeah, I have. I'm sorry I
didn't say anything before.

It's just... I wanted to
protect Dina, I guess.

Who sent it to you?

I got it from my friend Sarah
who goes to Greenleaf.

I guess she and Dina
were at an all-star camp

this Fall or something.

Hey! I know you.

You go to Westfield, right?

No, sorry.

What are you, undercover?

It says it right on
your water bottle.

I'm totally great with faces.

Anyway, I was at the
Covington game.

You got a great shot.

Oh. Thanks.

Sorry, I'm Sarah. Midfielder.

Dina.
And this is Karen.

She's a forward for Evanston.

Heading to check in?
Yeah.

It's right there. See ya.
Thank you.

Hey! Uh, Dina Van Cleve?

All right! Nice job, Dina!

Sarah wasn't kidding
about your shot.

Oh, thanks.
I'm going to go grab a drink, want one?

Yeah, sure.

She's right over there.
Oh, my God.

Is that Dina?
Oh, my God!

No way...

What happened?

Delete it.
Oh, come on.

God, I was blind.

She seemed genuinely excited
to go to that camp,

and then she came back
a different person.

I didn't even notice.

If all the kids at camp saw it.

How far did it spread?

It definitely went viral.

It's probably everywhere.

The mood is tense here this
morning at Westfield High,

and nobody knows exactly
what will go on here today.

The administration
is on high alert

and parents are being
brought in on the

investigation into the
death of Dina Van Cleve

will be underway and the police will
have a presence at this school,

as the details of her tragic
death are looked into.

Rachel Van Cleve,
who's daughter Dina

tragically took her own life,
has written a scathing article

that was published today
in the Daily Exchange...

Hey... Um, so, do you know what's going
on with all the reporters outside?

They're here for
student reactions.

To what?
Dina's mom wrote an article.

Some news affiliates
picked it up.

What are you talking about?

"Bullying in our schools."

OK.

Wait, she actually wants
a police investigation?

She wants someone to blame.

OK. But, you don't think the police
would really get involved, right?

I mean, Dina did kill herself.

"Where's the community's
allegiance?

Is it behind the teenage
girl who was bullied

and tormented to the point
of taking her own life?

Or, behind the
spit-shined reputations

of the rest of the scholarship-greedy,
college bound, student body?

This is criminal behavior and
it should not be tolerated..."

And it goes on.

I know, I know, she's
so angry, but...

I think that a lot of people are
going to be really angry about this.

Hi.
Hi.

How was your day?
Weird.

There were cops and
reporters everywhere

when I got to school
this morning.

Why?

They're making a federal case out
of that whole bullying thing.

That's ridiculous.

I don't know. Everyone seems,
like, super freaked out.

Are you?
No.

I mean...

I kind of said some stuff to
her after that text came out.

Yeah, but you were
just kidding, right?

Yeah...
I mean, it's high school

it's what people do.

Everybody needs to relax.
I guess.

OK? Don't even think about it.

OK.

OK.

Did you know Dina Van Cleve?
Uh, I... I can't really talk about it.

Did something happen at
school the day she died?

Did somebody say
anything to her?

Or harass her in anyway?

Please, Byron...

Seriously, any tiny
bit of information...

I'm sorry, but you're
wasting your time.

OK.

Hey, I don't mean with me.

I mean here. At the school.

You're not going to
find anyone here

who's going to give you
what you're looking for.

And we're under a
lot of pressure

from the administration
to keep an even keel.

I'm sorry, I don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

I'm saying parents can be very
protective of their kids.

Especially when it seems like
someone is intent on hurting them.

And you didn't help
things with that article

that you wrote in the paper.

Where were these parents when
my daughter was being bullied?

Kids can be cruel.
And adults should know better.

Rachel?

May I speak with
you in my office?

The school made a lot of
mistakes when it came to Dina.

But, maybe we can do
something to prevent another

tragedy from happening
in the future.

I'm starting a
school-wide campaign,

and a discussion group
called, "Kindness Matters."

It'll be a safe zone where kids can talk
about the pressures they are feeling

and get some support
from their peers.

These kids tortured my
daughter for weeks.

They don't need a club.
They need to be punished.

We can't change what's
happened to Dina.

But, maybe we can use it to make a
real difference for someone else.

The administration put you
up to this, didn't they?

They want to distract me.

They want to shut me up,
is what they want to do.

I'm doing this for you, Rachel.

I want to help you. I
want you to trust me.

I did trust you.

I trusted you with my daughter.

Mrs. Van Cleve.

I can not have you continually
harassing my students and faculty.

You have got to be kidding me.
I'm not harassing anybody.

Please stop this witch hunt.

How often do you go into
the girls restroom?

Well, I don't...

You are either completely
incompetent at your job

or you are covering
for these kids.

And honestly, I
can't decide which.

But, either way, I'm not going
to stop asking questions

until I find the answers
I'm looking for.

Well, I can't help you.
Yes, I know.

You've made that
abundantly clear.

I'll go over your
head if I have to.

Fine.

Somebody is going to be held
accountable for my daughter's death.

Hi. Hi.

I am so sorry I'm late.

Look, I'll save you the apology.

We decided to go in a
different direction.

A different direction?

We signed with Foster-Healey
this morning.

They're going to represent us.

No, please. I mean, I know
that I've been unavailable...

Frankly, Rachel, no one
will touch the house

if you're selling it.

Who told you that?

Bill's employer wants him
in Atlanta in a month.

We just can't afford to have
this idle on the market.

I'm sorry.

Oh, my God.

You didn't see anything?

No, nothing.

Somebody must have dropped these
off, they don't have postmarks.

Oh... I'm sorry, I
didn't anything.

I've been in and out all day...

There was nothing unusual?

No strange cars...

Define strange cars?
I don't know...

Oh...

Excuse me.

Hello?

What?

No. No, no, no. I'll
be right there.

I have to go.

Oh, no...

No... no...

Who did this?

I don't know.

I don't believe you. Who
are you protecting?

No one. I just came here
to pay my respects.

You don't respect her.

If you did, none of
this would've happened.

Look, you weren't the
only one who lost her...

Who loved her.

If you love her, then you
will tell me the truth.

Did you send the text?

Did you want to seem like a
big man to all your friends?

No, it wasn't like that.
Then by all means, Mark.

You tell me what it was
like, because I sure

as hell can't get anybody
else to talk to me.

She sent the text to you.

Who else possibly could
have forwarded it?

I swear, I didn't
forward it to anyone.

You're just a coward.

You're just like
the rest of them.

Hello, Rachel.

I just stopped by to
let you know that

Mark Carey was arrested
at school this morning

for suspected distribution
of child pornography.

Is that really what you wanted?

They've released Mark on
his own recognizance.

Apparently, he swears
he received the text,

but he didn't do
anything with it.

He was too embarrassed for Dina.

He said it was a personal thing.

The text came from his phone.

Even if he didn't do it, don't
you think he knows who did?

I don't know.

The police are still working
on getting the phone records.

Good.

Principal Brannigan and I have
been inundated with calls

from irate parents saying
this has gone way too far.

Is that what this
is actually about?

I don't care.

I don't care about the parents.

All I care about is finding
out what happened,

but these kids are
hiding something.

I know it, and you know it too.

OK. I understand.

But you do understand that even
if somebody deliberately sent

Dina's text viral, you can't
blame them for what Dina did.

She had a choice.

I want the cell phone records.

Claire.

Claire.

I, I can't be seen with you.

What?

Nothing. It's just that I'm
under a lot of pressure.

Claire, please... Please just...

Give me two minutes.

Tell me what happened Homecoming
night after the dance.

What do you mean?

You know that's the night
Dina sent Mark the text.

Yeah, of course.

Well, there had to be a
reason for her to do it.

What?

Oh, Claire. This
is so important.

Was Mark with Skylar at the
after party that night?

I don't know.

What do you mean with...

Did they do anything?

Did they hook up?

â™ª When she walked
into the room â™ª

â™ª I got addicted to
my point of view â™ª

â™ª Now I can't stop - â™ª Hey!

â™ª And I won't stop - â™ª Hey!

â™ª Come back and
show me some more â™ª

Claire.

Did Skylar send you that text?

Did she find it on Mark's phone?

Mark, you've got to help me.

They listen to you,
they respect you.

Just, please tell
them this whole thing

is between you and me.
And to just back off.

It's not that simple, Dina.

Yes, it is.

Stop! Come on!

She's really got
you whipped, huh?

Why is Skylar pushing
this so hard?

You know I didn't send
that text, right?

No, Mark. I don't.

I would really like
to believe you,

but by the way that
you're acting,

and hanging out with her,

bragging to your friends...

Oh, if it isn't Dina Van Slut.

You know this is going to
follow you forever, right?

Uh. OK, what?

You know she totally
deserves it.

No, she doesn't.

She sent that picture to
me, not the whole school.

OK, but only one of us was willing
to show you the real thing.

What'd you do? Steal my phone

and send it to the
entire football team?

Mm. Yeah, Mark. That
is exactly what I did.

No, of course not. You
know I wouldn't do that.

Then why do you
hate her so much?

Mark, I sent that
picture to one person.

And so that makes
me the bad guy?

I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

So, it was Skylar. OK.

What difference does it make?

Makes a lot of difference.

Thank you.

Hi.
I need to talk to you.

I need to talk to you too.

I know it wasn't you.

I understand why you
thought it was me.

I'm so sorry.

She had everything
going for her.

Everything.

But, I was just too
stupid to see it.

If I hadn't been
such a jerk to her,

she never would've
sent that picture.

And I...

I feel so guilty.

It all just, spiraled
out of control, but...

It started with me.

You have no idea how
vicious it was.

How can kids...

How can we be so
brutal to each other?

I want you to know that I didn't
send that picture to anyone.

I know.
I didn't.

I know.

But, I saw what it
was doing to her.

And I didn't do a
thing to stop it.

It's OK.

It's OK.
I'm sorry.

I know.
I'm sorry.

It's still tough
seeing him, huh?

What?

Oh, yeah...

I'm sorry.

Well, I'll tell you this...

it's his loss, and I mean that.

Hey.

You're on to bigger
and better things.

Try and focus on that, OK?

Sure.

I love you.

Love you, too.

Bye, Mom.
Bye, sweetie.

Slut.

She was cutting class.

Her grades were slipping.

She was even missing practice.

I couldn't believe she was
skipping field hockey practice.

She loved that game
more than anything.

Where's Dina?
Does it really matter?

It's not like she's been
a real part of this team

since she sent that whole
porno around the school.

Don't you think you're being
a little hard on her?

It's been, like, three weeks.

Maybe we should just lay
off her for awhile.

What? No!

She totally deserves it.

She broke the first
rule of sexting.

Don't show your face.

It's always neck down, knees
up, no birth marks. Duh.

I guess.

I don't know, I just thought
maybe she's been through enough.

Yeah, but did you also know
that if we go to playoffs

with Dina Van Cleve
on our roster,

and that picture gets her
punted from the team

our whole season's at jeopardy.

They can disqualify us.

They can do that?

God, yes Claire.
They can do that.

It's like she doesn't even care.

So someone should
really tell Coach.

I can't show her that picture.
I'll get in trouble.

But, you still
have that picture?

I mean, I figured some Freshman
boys had it to perv on,

but really? I deleted
that like after a day.

Yeah, I deleted it too.
Whatever.

It's not like you even
have to show her.

Just tip her off. It's
not that hard to find.

Well, why don't you do it?

Because, Claire, Dina beat
me out for All Stars.

If I did it, it'd look
like sour grapes.

But, if you did, it's
just civic duty.

I don't know.

Life lesson, Claire:

We are the company we keep.

And if you want to walk this world
with the likes of Dina Van Cleve?

That's fine.

But remember, it'll be
your social suicide.

I wish I could take everything
that happened back.

I never meant to hurt her.

I want you to listen to me.

You are not responsible for
what happened to Dina.

And, I want to thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

Being honest with me.

You're the only
one who has been.

Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

What? In mourning the
death of your child?

Of course.

No, I mean in a larger sense.

Do you think I'm...

Do you think I'm
pushing too hard?

Well... maybe.

I don't know. I...

You know, everybody has to deal
with these things in their own way.

Sometimes I really feel
like I'm going to be OK.

And then...

I will see something,

and it will remind
me so much of her.

That this...

wave just comes over me.

And... And I seize up.

Oh, God sometimes I
feel like the only way

that I can keep moving,
is if I, um...

if I have a purpose.

It's why I had to find
out who did this?

I'm going to make
us some more tea.

Yeah?

I know it was Skylar.

Excuse me?

I know it was Skylar
who sent the text.

That's ridiculous. Why
would Skylar do that?

Because she was jealous of her.

Patty, she's been jealous of her
since the day she was born.

No, she's not.
Yes.

She's not. Who told you this?

One of the kids told
me in confidence.

And you believed them?
Yes, I believed them, Patty.

They had no reason to lie to me.

OK...

Skylar?

Honey, would you come
down here for a second?

Yeah, Mom?

Did you send that text
of Dina to anyone?

No, of course not.

But, you did receive it?

Well, yeah.

But, everyone did eventually.

Mrs. Van Cleve?

I swear, I would've never
done that to Dina.

Thank you, sweetie.

Sure.

I'd like to see her
phone, please.

Oh...

Rachel, you're crossing
the line here.

We have 17 years of friendship.

I deserve your trust, I
think I've earned it.

I don't know who told
you that Skylar did it,

but I promise you,
they're mistaken.

Oh, sweetie...

I'm sorry.
Oh...

I just miss her so much.

Oh, God.

You need something much
stronger than tea.

OK?

Let me go get us something.

Yes, yes.
OK.

I'll be right back.

Oh, God. I'll have a double.

I'm gonna...

I'm gonna go use your bathroom.

OK.
OK.

She thinks it was me.

If Mark got arrested
then I'm gonna be next.

Sweetheart, calm down. She
doesn't have anything,

it's just some baseless
finger pointing.

But, pointing leads to looking.

Yeah, but what's she gonna find?

You didn't send that
text out to anyone.

No.

Except for one person. I...

Sky!
It's just Claire!

I... I just didn't want her thinking Dina
was the saint everyone thought she was.

Does that mean I'm
gonna get in trouble?

It breaks our heart,
what happened to Dina.

But, you didn't put that scarf
around her neck. Did you?

Mom... Of course not.

Of course not. Of course not.

Then there's nothing
to worry about. OK?

Go grab those cookies.
Meet me in the kitchen.

Come on.

I'd like to drop the charges
against Mark Carey.

I think that's a wise decision.

After all, he's a bright young man
with a very promising future.

Because, I now firmly believe it was
Skylar Reid who instigated the bullying.

Rachel, why can't
you let this go?

I found a stack of magazines
in the Reid's bathroom

with cut out letters that
look exactly like the ones

on the threats I received.
That's hardly proof.

Well, maybe not. But once we
get the cell phone records,

I guarantee we're going to see it's
Skylar who sent around that text.

Rachel, we did. She only
sent it to one person.

Who?
Claire Stevens.

And then on Sunday afternoon

Claire broadcast the text to
about 40 different numbers.

We don't know who all the
recipients were yet,

but we do know it was Claire
who made the sext go viral.

I've heard people say that...

when you hit rock bottom

there's no where
else to go but up.

I've heard people say that...

when you hit rock bottom...
How could you do it?

There's no where
else to go but up.

I should call the
police right now.

And like everyday, I
wake up and I just...

sink lower

and lower then I ever

thought possible.

Jesus...

Today...

I don't really know
what to say...

Today, I got kicked off
the field hockey team.

And my scholarship offer
to Price is gone.

Dina?
Yeah?

Do you have a minute?
Yeah.

I saw the picture.

And I have no choice but to
ask you to leave the team.

And it breaks my heart because
I am required by NCAA rules,

to report this to Price as well.

I'm so sorry.

I know this was just some
harmless little thing

between you and your boyfriend.

But, unfortunately it has
enormous consequences.

I'm so sorry.

If you want to talk about it,

my door is always open, Dina.

I didn't know you still
went to this school.

Oh, um... Dina, I
forgot to ask you,

how was All Star camp? You
know, my friend Sarah said

that you made quite
the impression.

What a waste, right?

Man, those scouts must've
been really impressed.

You know, with your tits.

You are such a bitch.

Yeah, it's better then a slut.

Oh, my God!

Dina!
What? If you hated me that much,

I'm surprised it took you
that long to run to Coach.

What are you talking about?

I'm off the team.

Don't pretend you didn't know.

I didn't know, OK?

I also didn't know she
had it in her, wow.

What?

I didn't narc you out.
Claire did.

Shut up.
Yeah.

Because you guys are so close.

What's going on?
Is it true?

What?

How could you do that to me?

What are you talking about?

You know what I'm talking about!
You stabbed me in the back!

For what, huh?

In some sad, misguided hope
that people would talk to you,

and not about you?

That they would like you?

When, newsflash. They won't.

You are so spineless.

She ratted you out, so
she's not so spineless.

Yeah, I'm not so spineless.

And I just feel like,
everything that I loved and...

And my escape and my
future is just gone.

And for what? You know?

Because I, I sent some stupid
picture to my boyfriend?

No, it's not... It's
because my best friend

decided to throw
me under the bus.

Claire,

I wish I could see your face

when you flip to the
end of this story.

I'm done.

Just... so done.

I hate myself for what I did.

I just, I wanted
Skylar to like me.

I didn't want the team
to be disqualified.

I never got to apologize.

I can't believe I didn't
help her, I just...

I was so scared.

The last time I saw her,

the way I treated her,

God, I really am spineless.

I am so sorry.

I'm so sorry that you lost
your daughter because I...

don't know how to
stand up to people.

How could you send that
to so many people?

I didn't Mrs. V, I
wouldn't do that.

After the dance, I forgot
my phone in the limo

and then the company dropped
it off at Skylar's house

and I went to pick
it up the next day.

That's why I thought that
it was Skylar all along.

You went to the Reid's house?

Mrs. Reid?
Yeah?

I found this phone in
the back of my limo

when I was cleaning
up this morning.

It was wedged between
one of the seats.

Those kids left quite a mess.

Oh, I'm sorry about that.
No problem.

I'm used to it.
OK.

Have a nice day.
Thanks.

Bye.

Patricia...

Oh, God...

Is that you, honey?

Hurry up, we gotta go
meet your dad for dinner.

Tonight? Ugh... I'm
so not up for that.

I know, but at least he's
not bringing the wife.

So, come on. Put
on something nice.

Mom? Your phone's ringing.

Must be Dad, saying
he's late as usual.

Just let it go to voice mail.

I'll call him back.

I'll just text him.

Claire?

I saw it.

I saw Dina's picture
on your phone.

Oh, my God, what did you do?

What are you talking about?

You sent it out?
No.

Claire sent it out. They
have the phone records.

But, you had Claire's phone.

So, what did you do? Send
yourself one for a souvenir?

I did it for you.

No...
Dina made you so unhappy.

And she took so much from you.

You wouldn't have gotten
that scholarship otherwise.

Mom! That was her scholarship.

She was the great athlete,
she was the honor student.

She deserved it.

You trashed her grave.

And the brick? It was all you!

You'll understand when you
have children of your own.

Skylar... I love you so much,

I would do anything for you.

Anything.

I may have teased her,
but I would've never

wanted her to kill herself.

OK. Listen to me.

It was just a harmless prank.

I had no idea Dina
was that unhinged.

But, but she killed herself. Not us.
Our hands are clean.

Mom, no they're not. And
they never will be.

Skylar! Honey, Skylar?

Where are you going?
Away from you!

Sky... Skylar!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Delete.

Patricia Reid?

Officer, my daughter just took off
in my car. And she's very upset.

You are under arrest for the suspected
dissemination of child pornography.

I need you to come with
me down to the station.

Is she going to be all right?

Did you come here to gloat?

No.

I came to say that I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry that you're
now going through the pain

that I'm going through.

If anybody on the earth
knows what it feels like,

it's me.

And I wouldn't wish that kind
of pain on my worst enemy.

And, I wanted to say that...

I'm sorry...

that you found my
daughter so threatening.

I don't know what
it could've been

about my sweet Dina that
threatened you so much.

But, I'm so sorry that
you felt that way.

And, lastly...

I'm sorry that our
friendship wasn't real.

I hope that Skylar's OK, Patty.

And I'll pray for that
sweet girl every night.

But, I will see you in court.

Someone once told me
that common sufferings

are far stronger bond
than common joys.

If that's the case then

Patricia and I are
closer than ever.

Dina's still gone.

And Skylar may never walk again.

I guess, ultimately, I thought I
might find some peace in all this.

Or, at least, I hoped I would.

I just wanted to understand
what my daughter went through.

And I wanted other people
to understand it, too.

But, now that it's over...

honestly, I just wish I knew I
made any difference at all.

Mrs. V?
Hey, come in.

Hi.

How are you?

I'm OK.

How are you?
I'm OK, too.

Um... I actually kind of
have a surprise for you.

Would you come with me?
To the school?

Do you need me to
go to the school?

Can you just trust me on this?

I trust you.

What is this?

You'll see.

Please have a seat.

I'm really glad you came.

Thank you all for
being here today.

As we all know, this
has been a fall

full of tragedy
here at Westfield.

We have lost a...

We have lost a member
of our Senior class.

It's easy to say that Dina was
responsible for her own death.

But, I think we all
know the truth.

Bullying is poisonous.

It pervades our schools and our
society in horrifying ways.

And today, with the anonymous
communication we have via technology,

it makes bullying
that much easier.

I'm going to say it right now,

and no one in this
room can deny it.

Dina Van Cleve was
bullied to death.

She was not responsible.

Everyone in this
room is responsible.

Everyone who saw the
text and passed it on.

Everyone who called her names,

everyone who giggled when
she passed in the halls.

Everyone who didn't do
everything in their power

to stop the cruelty that
Dina had to endure.

And I'm as guilty
as the rest of you.

Maybe even more so, because
I was Dina's best friend.

What I am proposing here
today maybe a small gesture,

but I think the statement
it makes will be huge.

I want each and every one of us

to take responsibility
for this tragedy.

And pledge to give
up our cell phones

for the rest of the semester.

Thank you.

All right, so this
is my response

to the "what is happiness" tag.

I know I should take more time to think
about the good things in my life.

So, this seemed like
the perfect excuse.

All right.

So, things that make me happy...

Uh... Christmas movies in August.
Yes!

Ahh, Gerbera Daisies.

Pink ones.
Pink ones.

My Dazzleglass lip gloss.

You mean the one you borrowed
from me and never gave back?

Uh-huh...

Claire's Dazzleglass lip gloss.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Uh...

Nnn... You made me lose
my train of thought.

OK, um...

Things that make me happy are...

Her boyfriend.
Very happy.

Ooh, care to elaborate?

On the Internet?

Um, my friends make me happy.

Why do I rate below
Gerbera Daisies?

Girl, it's in no
particular order.

All right.

My friends make me happy.

Usually.
Hey!

Dina, we're leaving in five.

OK!

Uh... And, my mom.

She makes me happy.

So, that's my list.

If you're watching this,
consider yourself tagged.
