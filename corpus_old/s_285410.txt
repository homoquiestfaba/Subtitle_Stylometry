He figured that
it would come in handy someday.

Thank you lord.

What do you want?

What is your problem?

You know dad is having
a rough time right now.

IRS is trying to take everything away.

At least Pearl's trying to help.

Look, she's not the only one
trying to help.

What do you do?
You don't even go to work any more.

Just don't worry about it, ok.

I mean you don't even talk
to me any more.

Look, I'm sorry about that, ok.

But it will all be over soon.

I got it all figured out now.

Got what figured out?
What can you do?

You just don't need to know

Is this about Goldie?

You know, he's not a good person.

Do you want to end up like Uncle Chan?

Look, you know I'm not like Uncle Chan.

Come here.
No, get off me.

Look Ploy, I don't need you
worry right now, ok?

I just don't need it.

So I'll need you to sign the bottom
of these papers, please.

Dad, this is an agreement
that you have to pay for IRS annually.

Dad, sign it.

Henry thank you for all of the work
that you did,

But...

But what?

But I think I will take care of it by myself.

He did everything for you.
How can you do this?

He's been doing this all week.

I pay for your time.

That's not the point,
Dad.

That is the point.

Somebody have to pay.

Don't look at me like that -
I'll wait in the car.

Dan?

My grandma invites you for dinner.

I just went to your room
but you weren't there.

I figured you would be here.

Please tell her I said thanks and
I'll see you then.

She made the soup herself.

So, how long have you been here?

I was in San Francisco for
the last 2 years before I move here.

He's probably just a dish washer.

You got a social?

Have you got a work permit?

No, sir.

So, where do you work now?

We're about to need help.

Shit man.

Can you drive?

Yes.

Fuck this, I'm out of here.

Say Pat.

So Dan would you come to work with me?

Yes.

Henry, I'm really sorry about my dad...

he can get really stubborn sometimes.

Really, that must be where you got it from.

I knew he was going to pull
something today.

Look, I know he'll come around.

He just needs some time that's all.

What, your kidding right?

Henry, he knows he has to deal with this.

Then he has to deal with this on his
own. I'm done it's over.

You have to help him, he's my father,

If you don't help him the IRS
they'll take everything, the restaurant.

No way.

that you never done it before.

Why did you work here?

It seems your dad need here.

I don't get it.
I've been trying to help him.

But he's never seen my thought.

Maybe your dad need other kind of help.

Pearl, isn't it?

I thought... l'd like to move back
to our house for a little while.

Just saw a smile from your dad today.

Why do you always stick
you nose on somebody else business.

Seem like your dad must love you a lot.

Yeah, he loved me.

But it's hard to stay under.

Because he always say being Thai,
you have to be a certain way.

Specially the lady.

Being Thai lady couldn't do this,
couldn't do that anything!

But why doesn't he took the fact if us
being in America.

American are so much lay back.

That's the Thai Traditional.

Anyone who understands
would be proud of being Thai.

So why are you here?

If I have a choice, I wouldn't be here.

How about your family,
don't you miss them?

They're so far away form you.

I'm not that far away from them.

I'm done for a day. I gotta go.

The killer was never found.

To investigated...

And discovered the killer
Chan the drug lord.

The investigation took 4 years.

Dan is that officer.

The fuck'en place is empty, dog.

Yo, I thought you said me was going

Shit, but not as fucking ruthless.

So you sure it's only going to be Tommy's
ass there that day?

Ya, as far as I know.

What the fuck you mean
as far as I know,

is he going to be the only
Motherfucker there or not?

Yes, yes -
It's collection day that day -

all the other guys
are out collecting payments.

It's the same thing every month.

Hey, you know I love you,
you crazy bitch, right?

I love you too.

I love this time of the day.

The sunset makes me calm
and be myself again.

Then it was Pat and Ploy.

You know about my past.

I just found out a few days ago.

I know every thing ever
since I met your dad.

My dad is a good man.

He's not like uncle Chan.

We never got to meet uncle Chan.

The only one who's like uncle Chan is Pat.

Pat, why did you do that for?

What?

I saw you Pat, I saw you driving away.

I ain't got time for this.

Were you going to kill Dan
is that why you were up there?

Pat you don't even know uncle Chan.

What about uncle Chan?

Dan was the one who killed him -
he was an old police in Thailand.

What, how do you know this?

Isn't that, Isn't that
why you where up there?

Look Dan fucked up some of my friends...

and he had it coming
that's why we broke into his apartment.

How, how do you know
he killed uncle Chan?

Ploy tells me.

I think Pat's like that...

Because the people
that he hang out with.

I try to warn him about Gol-d.

Yeah, that guy just
like your uncle Chan.

By the time I found out it was too late.

I made a wrong decision.
By going out with him.

I was a fool for believing him.

And one day I saw the real him.

I try to fight him.

I never told anymore before.

I want each man
at the corner of the house.

Two out front is that fucking, you clear that?

Yo, what's up dog,

No, man. He did even
know what hit him.

Pat, you're a bad Motherfucker.

You're a bad some, bitch.

Fuck, fuck, why can't shit go the way
I fucking plan it.

You know what
I hate more than anything?

No, dog. What's that man?

I hate when motherfuckers
take me for granted...

like that motherfucker right there.

Hey, Jules thought shit wasn't never
going to change.

Thought, I'd be busting my ass
on the street making you money.

No, it's all coming to and end.

You had a good run G...

Throw time is up.

It's my world now.

I wanted to wait for you dog,

but I couldn't resist
KC new her just wanted to get them -

You know, I can't afford her.

Not unless you had some fucking
extra money coming in.

I trusted you Motherfucker,

Come on, Goldie. I told you I did.

So why the fuck is Charlie and Jack...

Grab that bitch...

love of your life.

You asshole.

Get that Motherfucker go.

I want that Motherfucker dead.

Keep your hand up young lady.

Get them up.

Get them up.

Any visual on the gun?

No. No visual on the gun?
I shot him, I shot him.

Drop the gun.
I shot him, I shot him!

No, I shot him.

I shot him.

I shot him.

Of course, I feel bad for what I did.

I killed the person
and there's no excuse for that.

But I did what I had to do
to protect my family.

They understand that.

My brother wasn't a bad person.
He just made bad decisions.

He wanted to help my father
with his tax problem...

and he did it the only way
he thought he could.

Everybody said they didn't see anything.

No one would step up
and testify against me.

And everybody's fingerprints on the gun,

the police couldn't find
a case against me.

We have to look out for each other
in these crazy streets.

We're family.

Even Dan

Dan says: You stole my vest

Dan saved my brother...

even though my uncle
caused him harm.

We are so grateful to him

Although the doctor's say
that Pat will never be able to walk again

At least he's still alive.

My father's problem with the IRS
turned out to be a mistake...

and the case eventually dismissed.

It was such a relief.

All of us Thai people living
in Los Angeles

We're all out here trying to survive.

Trying to make a living.

Trying to hang on to our roots.

Those are the thing
we have to hold on too

Because that's all we have.

I've already been in here for
the past three months and now.

I'm finally going home.
