Okay guys, I got a visual on the van. Looks
clean. Just one bloke driving, stand by, over.

Heads up, they're entering the lane. I'm
going to see this gas and get ready to fire.

Gas truck's loaded.

They're coming your way.

Roger, we want no one hurt.

Get out.

Open the back doors, now.

We're taking your cargo. Move, move, move.

Surprise asshole.

You, get off the bike.

Get off the bike!

Come on, get over here. Piece of shit.


(Muffled yelling)

Will passenger Degrazzi on
flight 227 to Singapore,

please check in with airport
security, thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please.

We are sorry to announce that flight 1021 to Newark has been cancelled due to severe weather over New Jersey.

 You may- you may, excuse me- please.

You may either take special charter flight 1443 to Los Angeles,

and then reroute to Newark, landing in 37 hours.

Or- excuse me, excuse me.

00:05:1,920 --> 00:05:5,159
 Scott, Jennifer, Phillip.

00:05:5,160 --> 00:05:7,343
Everything is safe and sound.

00:05:7,760 --> 00:05:10,627
Or, you can return tomorrow for flight 1222

departing at this same time.

Thank you.

So we get to stay in a hotel
room.

We can't afford a hotel for an
extra night

Why not?

I'll catch up with you.

Team, we are taking that
charter flight.

Oh, A hotel room sure would have been nice.

Gun!

It's a lighter.

00:06:1,760 --> 00:06:2,760
Dr. Millhouse.

00:06:4,480 --> 00:06:6,480
There was a hijack attempt made on
the van.

00:06:7,760 --> 00:06:8,760
What?

00:06:9,400 --> 00:06:10,542
All the specimens are safe.

The project is still secure.

Why didn't you tell me something before?

Well, I'd rather not bother Dr Stewart and Dr Ryan.

Besides, we have to sit in
a flying tin can with them

for the next twenty hours.

I'll tell him when we land.

Absolutely. I think this is ah, it's better that we keep this between ourselves.

Yeah, I think you're right.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now boarding special charter flight

1443 to Los Angeles, all rows please
board at this time. Thank you.

Welcome aboard.

Oh, hi.

Welcome aboard, step this way.

How did it go, the tournament?

Oh, don't ask.

Oh, come on this way.

What's this about?

Special cargo, science team.

Oh, you're the new date girl.

I have master's degrees in
bioengineering and physics

and a doctorate in gene therapy.

00:08:0,120 --> 00:08:2,120
Okay, welcome aboard.

00:08:3,120 --> 00:08:4,999
Patti. I think you've got it
under control up here.

00:08:5,000 --> 00:08:6,279
I'm just going to head up to the cockpit

00:08:6,280 --> 00:08:8,519
and see if me and the
other hillbillies can

00:08:8,520 --> 00:08:11,120
get this plane off the ground.

Hey, hey, hey,

Oh, you just made it by the hair of my chin.

 Yeah, save it. Ah, just point me to my seat, okay?

Oh, I say he's in a mood, all right, 14C in coach.

Thanks.

Thank you, welcome aboard.

I have to put these away.

Where are you going to take those?

To stowage.

Yeah, well ah, don't lose them okay, I got an early tee time.

Not to worry.

Hello George.

Jack.

Jack.

Jack.

First my name, next thing you know you want my job.

Is our crate safe in the
cargo hold?

00:09:1,840 --> 00:09:4,239
You know, baggage handlers just throw everything around.

00:09:4,240 --> 00:09:5,959
Fred, is the cargo safe?

00:09:5,960 --> 00:09:7,679
Safe as houses.

00:09:7,680 --> 00:09:12,279
See Phillip, safe as houses
Fred's never let you down.

And I'm not about to start, Dr. Stuart.

And Lord, Jesus, if it shall be your will that I die
on this plane tonight.

Please let my Deliverance into
youre strong....

Pardon me, you're making me nervous.

This your first time flying,
girl?

Second.

And it'll be my last if I have anything to say about it.

Relax, baby.

You know, they say more people are killed
each year by donkeys

Than plane crashes.

Yeah, right.

Ladies and gentlemen were about
to take off.

Please fasten your seatbelts
and make sure that your tray

tables are in their upright and
locked position.

Please observe that Captain Jack
has turned on the no smoking sign,

smoking is prohibited
throughout the aircraft.

Thank you and have a
very pleasant flight.

00:10:7,440 --> 00:10:8,440
Jesus Jack.

00:10:8,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You're not going to smoke all
the way through this flight again, are you?

You really should quit.

No reason to.

Scott, listen.

I'm sorry.

I've been dumped before
I know how it works, but I'm

I know how it works,

but I'm just not done being mad at you yet.

Oh really?-

Yes, really Jen.

Let's see, you broke up with me a week
ago after three years together.

I think it's a little much for
you to expect me to be what,

00:12:2,720 --> 00:12:4,160
'fine' with this so quickly.

00:12:6,280 --> 00:12:8,280
Well I'm sorry.

Recirculated air, it makes me
irritable.

Apparently.

 I'm gonna go
splash some water on my face,

You know, Jennifer, there's an
old chemists expression,

"Don't leave your lunch bag near
a lit Bunsen burner"

What?

Don't date people you work with, Jennifer.

I never have.

Yeah, but you
never leave the lab Philip.

You never meet anybody you don't work with.

That's the
reason you never married.


Hey. Where do you think you're
going?

I just thought I'd see what
Courtney was doing.

No, Kourtney doesn't need your
shenanigans.

In fact, your shenanigans
bought you this seat -

And you're staying put.

Yeah but it's not my fault,
Shannon totally...

Oh, Shannon, Shannon, Shannon-

It's always Shannon, isn't it?

You know, what?

00:13:0,721 --> 00:13:2,520
Why don't you take
responsibility for yourself?

00:13:4,360 --> 00:13:5,200
I'm putting on my music

00:13:5,201 --> 00:13:7,160
and I don't want to be disturbed for anything.

00:13:9,000 --> 00:13:11,540


Yes, this is Millhouse. What went wrong?

You didn't say anything about the bloke in the back of the van

with the bloody gun.

The specimens are in the cargo hold right now.

I paid you people.

Just go and switch them.

Now I have to do this?

Jesus Chri... I have to do this?

That's right. You're on your own mate.

Fellas look like you need
something.

Coffee? Pillow?

No, thank you. We are fine.

Yes, fine.

Okay

Jaffe, I have a bad feeling.

You always have a bad feeling.

I can't even remember the
planes we've been on.

Rome, Bombay, Singapore, Australia

Shut up.

Own father died
attempting this same mission.

I have waited for 11 years.

I have worked for 11 years to
accomplish what he could not.

It is my destiny.

It is yours to, to succeed.

I hope so, brother. I hope so.

Allah, Allah,

00:15:1,320 --> 00:15:2,320
America.

(Cargo door closes)

00:17:1,520 --> 00:17:2,320
I think I'll stretch my legs.

00:17:3,920 --> 00:17:4,999
You okay Dr. Stewart?

00:17:5,000 --> 00:17:6,118
I'm fine, friend.

00:17:6,119 --> 00:17:6,760
Thank you.

00:17:6,760 --> 00:17:7,760
I'll be right back.

Young man, excuse me.

Yes ma'am?

I smell cigarette smoke.

Really? that's terrible.

I'm telling you I smell smoke!

I will see what we can do to
get that nasty smell out of your nose.

You just do that.

So, how are things in first?

Just taking care of the privileged passengers.

Life's rough for you, huh?

Mmh, enjoying the pit?

Ah- was that moving I
hear? No, it's that snotty Rich.

Cow you have to wait on

Bye, bye.

Dr. Millhouse.

What are you doing doctor?

Everything's okay.

00:18:3,400 --> 00:18:4,320
It's nothing,

00:18:4,321 --> 00:18:6,320
You should concern yourself with.

00:18:8,320 --> 00:18:9,599
That's odd.

00:18:9,600 --> 00:18:12,399
Here I thought I was head of
security for this outfit

Which would make whatever you're
doing to that cargo

Very much my concern.

Okay, listen fred, I'm going to level with you.

Phillip and Jennifer, they have, limited vision.

They just, they just don't know
how much money this technology is worth.

But you do.

Yeah, that's right.

I do,

And I can make sure that
there's a nice slice in it for you, Fred.

My good pal Fred, huh?

I make a living. I work for my pay.

Yeah, but why should you buddy?

Look this time next week

I'm in Hong Kong at a restaurant
eating sushi off a naked

woman's body and you can be
there with me.

Toasting to our Good
Fortune.

I don't like sushi

00:19:1,200 --> 00:19:3,200
The place I know makes a great burger.

00:19:3,560 --> 00:19:5,199
Come on, come on.

00:19:5,200 --> 00:19:6,599
Dr. Stewart, He trusts you-

00:19:6,600 --> 00:19:7,600
He trusts you even more.

00:19:8,960 --> 00:19:11,420
That's why this is going to work.

No, no, this isn't going to work.

This is over.

Jesus Christ Fred,

You really shouldn't fire a gun
on a plane, Fred.

I don't want to shoot his gun
at all.

Now we're going to go upstairs.

We're going to sit down together,

and we're going to fly to Los Angeles.

Dr. Stewart can deal with you when you land.

but for right now,

I'm going to keep all of this
between us.

Yeah, absolutely.

I mean this will fuck up here, it's my bad, right?

I just absolutely I think
that's 100% accurate,

it's a mistake. I am so sorry that I-

Come on you son of a bitch, get up, get up. Son of a bitch.

Oh Fuck, Jesus no, Fred...

Phillip, I'm having a few reservations
about our involvement with new investors.

I mean, the research
isn't Advanced enough to put

control of the work into the
hands of CEOs and marketing suits.

We haven't done anywhere
near enough testing-

Jennifer. I didn't want to mention this,
but to be bluntly honest.

00:21:3,920 --> 00:21:4,920
We're tapped.

00:21:6,520 --> 00:21:7,520
What?

00:21:7,720 --> 00:21:10,060
I've spent everything I have on the project.

Sold all my family's
lands and holdings.

We need money Jennifer.

We need money, facilities,
distribution.

Without new funding, It's all academic.

The work stops.

I have concerns brother.

Again? Why do you have concerns now?

I fear we might fail.

We cannot fail.

We boarded the plane
without any trouble

We are in the air.

And soon we will be in the international
airspace.

But I'm worried now if you-

Worrying will not help. Faith will.

Faith in Allah.

Faith in your brother.

Faith in yourself.

00:22:2,040 --> 00:22:4,400
We have a lot to do. Why don't you go to sleep.

00:22:5,270 --> 00:22:6,638
Get some rest.

00:22:7,310 --> 00:22:9,229
Thank you, brother.

All right, Jack.

Dreams do come true.

You drive for a while.

Let me go grab a cup of coffee.

You got it, Jack.

Oh man.

Hey, why don't you two take that to
the bathroom?

Why, that's a fine idea.

Come on, Brad.

Yeah, mile high club.

I had to say something.

And it was a good something, girl. (laugh)

Come on, brad.

00:23:7,400 --> 00:23:8,400
Can I get that for you darling?

00:23:9,360 --> 00:23:10,360
It's doctor.

Whoa, you're doing a lot of damage to that fine airplane coffee.

I don't think there's anything
I could do to make this coffee worse.

Besides, my boyfriend
likes it this way.

Well, I don't see your
boyfriend anywhere.

I'm a big girl, I can take care
of myself.

They've been in there forever.

They're probably making the
sweet, sweet love.

Oh, oh.

00:24:9,880 --> 00:24:11,320
I'm sorry, you had to get your
coffee yourself.

Oh, that's okay.

I got to meet the captain.

You mean Captain broken heart?

What do you mean?

Oh honey.

He's a one woman man, and she
died eight years ago.

He was flying a little Cessna
into San Francisco.

Hit a low patch of fog.

He lived. His wife and her
sister didn't.

Oh my God, that's terrible.

That's what they all
say, sweetie.

You know, I tried to play in
that Briar Patch a few years ago

and got stung. Mark my words: run.

I'll take that under
advisement.

Okay. You're a winner, you're a winner, you're a winner, you're a winner. Okay.

00:25:4,000 --> 00:25:6,200
You're a winner, you're a winner.

No, you are not here to taunt
me again.

Just wanted you to see
my face again.

So it'll be burned in your
memory when I'm gone.

And on that Bahamas route.

talk to the Elbow because the hand

wants to smack you.

Help! A little help here?

Hey, stewardess! Come on.

Think it's one of yours.

Yes, sir.

What can I do for you?

00:26:8,360 --> 00:26:9,160
Getting a warning light from
Avionics.

That's probably just a short.

Hey, George make me feel good
and go down to avionics and

check it out, will ya?

Karate girl, huh?

Yeah.

So you got a man in the States.

Look, I'm sure you're a really
nice guy and everything, but

I'm so not in the mood.

Just asking a question.

You know, you got some pretty
titties for a karate girl.

You're gross.

You're weird.

00:27:1,640 --> 00:27:2,160
Thanks.

My name's Courtney.

Ah, Gunther.

So what are you supposed to be, Gunther?

Some sort of vampire?

Sometimes. So what are you doing
in Australia?

I'm leaving Australia. I was in this huge
karate tournament.

We're qualifying for the World
Championships, broke my arm

I can see that.

So, what are you doing in
Australia?

I'm studying aborigine Burial techniques.

Not really.

Oh, entirely.

I found this most fantastic coffin.

A coffin?

Yeah, it's in the hold.

My doberman is guarding it.

Is that right?

Yeah.

Wait, it's really quite
interesting.

George sure has been gone a while
hasn't he?

 Who wants to try reaching him on the intercom?

00:29:4,889 --> 00:29:5,680
He's not picking up.

00:29:5,681 --> 00:29:8,040
Maybe I'll wander down there and
see if he needs a hand.

00:29:9,720 --> 00:29:10,919
Are you kidding me?

I thought you were going to have to die before I ever

Got to sit in the big chair.

I'll be right back.

Don't even think about it.

If I wanted a bunch of teenagers
jumping all around me.

I would have stayed at home.

Listen, I have more work here
than God, and if I don't finish it

before we land, I'm dead.

Okay? so I-

Nice to meet you, too.

George? George.

Come on, quit messing around.

What the hell has happened here?

Oh, oh, God!

Some one next door doing the same thing.

00:30:0,520 --> 00:30:1,680
Let's give them a run for their
money.


Is everything okay in here?

Where the hell have you been?

We have a situation.

What?

Get ground control on the
horn and tell them we have

an emergency situation up here.
I'll be right back.


Oh, Jeez.

What they don't know won't hurt them.

Ow!

What is that?

00:31:5,320 --> 00:31:6,600
This is recyclable. Dammit.

00:31:8,480 --> 00:31:11,040
Pattie, why are you putting recyclables in the trash?

Oh, that stings.

Something wrong?

You see those two guys over
there?

Yeah?

 Do you remember them
boarding?

No, now that you've mentioned it.

Me neither.

And I don't see anything listed
on the Manifest for those seats.

Pattie, could you keep
everyone out of here for a few minutes?

Certainly Captain.

Thanks.

00:32:7,120 --> 00:32:10,440
Gentlemen, may I have a word
with you, please?

Please, this way.

Know what the hell you're doing
on my plane.

We are flying to America!

Cut the shit and tell me what the

hell you're doing on this
flight.

Sir, sir, we are very sorry, but,

we do not have proper papers.

I don't think you realize how
difficult it is to get work

visa for America and other
countries.

No, no, it's okay, it's okay Jaffe.

My brother and I we, we will
make a great electricians in your country.

We can fix anything.

Anything! it is true, anything.

Oh man. You guys are just illegals.

Sir, please.

Quiet, quiet.

Listen to me.

00:33:1,600 --> 00:33:3,200
I'm going to deal with you once I
get back to Los Angeles.

00:33:3,280 --> 00:33:5,720
Now I want you to go back and sit
in your seats and remain there

00:33:6,120 --> 00:33:7,520
for the rest of the flight, right?

INS can deal with you

Once we get back to Los Angeles,
now go sit.

Jaffe.

Faith. Faith, my brother, faith.

We've got trouble.

I've been hailing Ground
Control and every frequency.

Nobody's responding.

Shit.

Are you sure?

Checked, double-checked triple-checked.

All right.

This is what we're going to do
Jack.

I'm gonna go check the seat
phone and see if I can reach Ground

Control that way.

Hi.

You sure you're the
captain?

You never seem to be flying the
plane.

Hey, I can fly This Plane
blind.

00:34:0,680 --> 00:34:2,399
Listen.

00:34:2,400 --> 00:34:3,809
I know this is going to sound a
little weird.

00:34:3,833 --> 00:34:4,680
Probably.

00:34:5,282 --> 00:34:7,681
Can I use your credit card?

00:34:8,782 --> 00:34:9,594
That is weird.

What, are you gonna order takeout?

No, I just need to make a quick
call.

It's personal and the airline's
doesn't like it when I make

personal calls from the cockpit

A personal call? A girlfriend?

Uh, no,

I haven't had one of those in
quite a while.

Ah.

What about a cell phone?

I have one but they really
don't work in planes and

certainly not this far over the
ocean.

You don't have a credit card?

Declined. It's not going to be a
long call.

What do you say?

Sure, no problem.

One call no shopping.

Thanks.

I'll bring it right back.

I need to be connected to control
tower.

My name is Captain Jack Russell
clearance code Alpha 154 triple

seven. Thank you.

Yes.

Hello.

My name is Captain Jack
Russell.

I'm on flight 1443 heavy
Melbourne to Los Angeles.

Who am I talking to? Over.

Roger, 1443.

This is Bob Campbell.

Hey, you're not calling on a
state of calm line.

Captain where are you calling from? Over.

I'm on a seat phone in the main cabin.

We have an emergency situation up here, over.

What's the nature of your
emergency captain?

Unidentified.

There's some kind of-

Say again?

We have a man down.

1443. We lost you there.

Hello?

Hello?

Come in, 1443.

Mike!

00:36:2,040 --> 00:36:3,040
Oh, come on.

00:36:5,560 --> 00:36:7,693
Everybody, please remain seated!

Sorry folks, the situation is under control, if you all could just remain seated.

00:37:1,560 --> 00:37:3,959
Hey, Doc, you're one of the
science people, right?

00:37:3,960 --> 00:37:4,480
Yeah.

00:37:4,481 --> 00:37:6,760
Well, I think there's something
you ought to know about.

That's all we got? Unidentified?
'Some kind of' .. Some kind of what?

that's all we got before we cut
off.

It's FAA time people.

Everybody, back to coach!

Come on, Dr. Stewart.

Come on ma'am, let's go.

00:38:0,960 --> 00:38:2,839
We're going to be safer back there, come on, let's go.

00:38:2,840 --> 00:38:5,573
I'd rather be dead than go back to coach.

00:38:8,440 --> 00:38:9,440
Jan! Jan! Jan!


Here!

Phillip, what the hell is happening here?

Well, I knew the cloning
process would very

likely quadruple their
size but not this fast!

Scott! Scott, did you
know this was going to happen?

I had no idea this was gonna
happen Philip, no, this is

totally, totally unprecedented.

Don't, do not touch them.

Oh, thanks.

Yeah, because you know, I was
thinking about going and petting him.

That thing almost got him.

Yeah, but it didn't.

It almost took my head off.

You're lucky.

It's still

...working.

You're lucky that thing didn't eat you.

You know, I never did get your
name.

It's Jennifer.

Jack.

Enough Jibber-jabber, where are they
where those things go?

They obviously retreated.

What the hell is crawling all over

my plane killing people.

00:40:0,881 --> 00:40:3,239
Yo, what the hell are
those things?

00:40:3,240 --> 00:40:4,440
They're scorpions.

00:40:4,600 --> 00:40:5,759
You're kidding.

00:40:5,760 --> 00:40:6,440
Scorpions.

00:40:6,441 --> 00:40:7,959
I seen Scorpions on one of them

00:40:7,960 --> 00:40:10,519
animal shows, they're about that
big.

that ain't no scorpion.

Yeah, and there's nothing
listed on your cargo manifest

about giant scorpions with your
equipment.

They weren't giant scorpions
when we put them on the plane.

They were simply dormant
specimens and we listed them as such.

There's no way they could
have gotten out.

They were in a secure containment crate.

See, the canisters must have

been jostled when your
plane lost control.

Well, that'd be a good theory
except for the fact that we

lost control because one of
those big ass son of a bitches

was in the cockpit!

What?

Yeah, and I take it kind of
personally.

But just how big is

this big ass, son of a bitch in
the cockpit?

Big.

Mighty bigger?

Yeah.

There's a queen.

You the FAA Specialist?

Yes sir, I'm Curtis Burnham.

This is Mr. Highball,

Mr. Brick

Mike Rowe.

Hi, Mike.

Bob's been keeping an eye on
things here.

Bob?

Wow, that was fast.

This is Mr. Burnham.

Curtis, please.

Hi, Bob.

So how long since the phone
call from that plane?

63 minutes 22 seconds?

Okay.

Have you had any contact at all
with anyone on the plane since?

Any Ransom calls, any possible
hijackers, or terrorists?

No, nothing like that.

Just that short phone call then
a sharp dive an altitude about

10 minutes ago, but it looks
like they leveled off.

Yeah.

I see you've got them on radar.

Yeah, we got them on radar, but
that's all we got.

Well good work, Bob.

Good work.

Hey, you mind if my guys sit
there?

No, not at all.

00:42:7,160 --> 00:42:8,239
Okay highball.

00:42:8,240 --> 00:42:10,039
I need schematics to the plane.

I need cargo manifest, crew
complement, passenger manifest

brick establish a link to
Strategic Air Command and the

National Weather Center.

I want to know if there's any
military in that airspace and

what the storm is going to do.

Yes sir.

What the hell is going on up there?

Jennifer now, you know, I'd
help if I didn't have to stand back.

Watch the arm.

Is everybody here?

Everybody who is here, is here.

I think we can safely say that
everybody who is not here,

is dead.

Where's Fred?

One of the
specimens must have got him.

00:43:1,560 --> 00:43:2,560
Oh, poor Fred.

00:43:2,600 --> 00:43:3,080
And listen people.

00:43:3,081 --> 00:43:4,479
I've got to get off of this
plane.

00:43:4,480 --> 00:43:4,980
I have a very very important
meeting-

00:43:5,040 --> 00:43:6,173
What's your name?

00:43:6,960 --> 00:43:7,960
McCellan.

00:43:8,120 --> 00:43:9,120
McCellan?

00:43:9,920 --> 00:43:11,680
We all know that you have an important
meeting.

Okay?

Hey, didn't you guys say that you
could build anything to fix anything?

Oh, yes, of course.

Definitely Sir, but we need to

know more about what we are up against.

Yes, in order for us to properly defend ourselves.

They're giant scorpions.

Okay?

No problem.

We have other problems.

Yeah, what's that?

Well, to start with,
my crew is dead.

And I'm the only one left who
can land This Plane.

Well do us all a big favor and
don't die.

Well, that was a big part of my plan.

Good.

What else?

Communications are down.

We need to talk to the ground
in order to plan this thing.

Plus we need to get into avionics
and activate the Apu.

Apu? What is the freakin Apu?

Auxiliary power unit, sir?

Exactly.

00:44:0,160 --> 00:44:1,959
What's your name again?

00:44:1,960 --> 00:44:3,599
Jaffe, Jaffe sir.

00:44:3,600 --> 00:44:5,599
Jaffe. Good.

00:44:5,600 --> 00:44:6,160
All right.

00:44:6,161 --> 00:44:9,879
We also need weapons. Between
those pincers and the Venom

00:44:9,880 --> 00:44:11,679
that they're packing in their
tails were going to need some

heavy-duty artillery.

Alright. Well,

let's find out what we got.

Okey-dokey. Strategic Air

Command says they've got nobody
in that airspace.

Thank God for small favors.

They want to know if there's
anything they can do to help

Tell them thanks, and we'll let them
know.

What does the National Weather
Center say about that storm?

Well, the good news is that
it's not going to get any worse.

And the bad news?

It's not gonna get any better.

Yeah, of course.

What have you got?

We can do it! Good! We can do it!

00:45:0,040 --> 00:45:1,159
Should we be ready then to make our way
down.

00:45:1,160 --> 00:45:2,120
The cargo hold?

00:45:2,120 --> 00:45:2,840
Yes!

00:45:2,841 --> 00:45:4,039
Sounds like it.

00:45:4,040 --> 00:45:4,760
But those things are down there though.

00:45:4,761 --> 00:45:5,799
Those things are
everywhere.

00:45:5,800 --> 00:45:6,480
What do you want?

00:45:6,481 --> 00:45:8,160
You know, you're getting bossy.

00:45:8,220 --> 00:45:9,160
Sorry!

00:45:9,161 --> 00:45:10,560
Tool Box. Tool boxes.

Yeah, the tool boxes are

in the cargo hold.

They would be most helpful.

We can definitely use those. Listen, how many of those things are there, do you think?

Worst case scenario, 20.

Minus the dead one, 19.

19!

You're saying, with the giant
one locked in the cockpit,

there's eighteen of those
things roaming the plane?

Listen, I'm going to take those odds, and I'm going to go down to the APU

I'm going to turn that
thing on.

Okay?

Okay, I'll go with Captain Jack.

Highball.

What have you got on that
plane?

Just a second,

Boom. full schematics, passenger
manifest, crew complement, cargo manifest.

Okay, highball find me a
way to talk to that plane.

You got it.

Is everybody ready?

Okay, I will now open the hatch.

00:46:1,160 --> 00:46:3,620
Do it slow. Let me have the flashlight.

Be careful.

You guys have got to be kidding
me.

This stuff is never going to
work.

You know, what if he's got a
better idea.

Sure we'd all be real glad to hear it.

Yeah, I got a great idea.

Why don't we just land just
bug-infested heap and get another plane?

Great, right because
we're over the ocean stupid.

00:47:6,800 --> 00:47:7,800
Alright, avionics is this way.

00:47:8,320 --> 00:47:9,760
Yeah but our tools are that way.

00:47:9,800 --> 00:47:11,880
Okay, Let's get the tools first and
we'll deal with avionics.

No, You and I are going to
avionics.

I need your expertise.

Oh Really? what for?

I need someone to hold a flashlight,
you think you can handle that?

Let's go.

I will find the tools Dracula.

Did you find any weapon?

My name is not Dracula.

It's Gunther.

Actually it's not Gunther, it's Joe.

I'm from New Jersey.

I've just been using the accent
to impress women. My life is a sham.

Dracula,

um, Gunther,

Joe.

This is a great story.

00:48:0,960 --> 00:48:3,599
But this is not the right time
for a personal identity crisis.

00:48:3,600 --> 00:48:4,400
Yeah?

00:48:4,400 --> 00:48:4,960
Yeah.

00:48:4,960 --> 00:48:5,800
Yeah.

00:48:5,800 --> 00:48:6,160
Yeah.

00:48:6,160 --> 00:48:6,800
Yeah.

00:48:6,801 --> 00:48:9,159
Hey, this is no storytelling
time.

00:48:9,160 --> 00:48:9,600
Huh?

00:48:9,600 --> 00:48:10,080
There are scorpions.

Come on.

Come on, brother.

Come, hey, hey, Dracu- Gunther

come.

So where you from

Small talk, eh?

Moved around a lot, army brat.

Army brat? sounds about
right.

You?

Well, darlin' I wake up

up every morning.

and I thank God that I'm a Texan.

That explains a lot.

What do you mean by that?

Nothing.


Oh Geez, oh Geez.

come on.

So, uh, you people are scientists?

That's right.

So fill a brother in, right?
Why you making giant scorpions?

00:49:0,880 --> 00:49:4,679
Um, complicated.

00:49:4,680 --> 00:49:5,296
Try us.

00:49:5,320 --> 00:49:10,479
We were trying to synthesize a
biogenetic pathogen that would

aggressively combat disease.

Diseases like AIDS, cancer,

components of this pathogen are
found in great abundance in

scorpion hormonal secretions.

So you were raising giant
fucking scorpions.

Um, not exactly, no.

Then what the hell do you mean?

Those animals never existed before,

they are an entirely new
species.

You guys are saying that these

things are like say the Killer
Bees where you genetically

crossed an African Honey Bee
with the American Honey Bee and

Bam the killer bee was born?

Precisely.

Damn, baby, you sexy and smart.

Oh, I saw it on the news.

Yeah Well and just what did you
cross these giant fucking

scorpions with?

Oh,lots of things
but the primary

induction was the DNA from the
fossilized remains of a

00:50:0,480 --> 00:50:2,879
Paleolithic scorpion millions
of years old.

00:50:2,880 --> 00:50:6,320
So you made Jurassic Park
scorpions?

Look over there

What is this?

Looks like a dead
skin of a Scorpion?

It's not mine.

Oh Shit!

00:51:3,920 --> 00:51:6,987
There will be more scorpions, everybody hurry!

Ow!

This is bad.

How bad?

Real bad.

Hurry! Come on!

Hurry up.

The whole circuit board is
melted.

We're gonna have to turn on the
auxiliary power unit at the

source.

Okay?

But we've got bigger problems.

We do?

See those cables?

The shredded ones?

Yeah.

Those control the landing gear.

(Gunther screaming)

Where is it?

APU, APU...

Jack?

Jen, find the switch!

This it?

Yes! Prime it. Get out of here.

How goes it Curtis?

Well not as quickly as I'd like.

Anything I can do to help?

Actually, Yes Mike there is
they passed over Hawaii hours

ago? And so I'm operating under
the assumption that the plane

will be landing directly here
and she's going to be coming in

pretty fast and hard.

When that happens, I don't want
to be scrambling for Runway.

I hear that.

00:53:9,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Quick! in here.

I'm cross-referencing the passenger manifest with the customer listing of

every cell phone company Nationwide.

What, you can do that?

Of course not

that would be in violation

of these citizens rights to privacy.

Yeah, either that or Industrial Espionage.

Yeah, I forget which.

I need two more minutes.

Hey, I heard about your wife

you want to talk about this
now?

I'm sorry.

Let's talk about the APU some more.

All right, it's just

I feel like

00:54:3,800 --> 00:54:5,333
I still miss her and...

00:54:8,800 --> 00:54:11,320
There's a lot to enjoy in this
world Jack.

I think she'd want you to be
doing that.

Enjoying the world instead of clinging to loss
for the rest of your life.

That's real understanding of you.

Hey, I see a sad guy who could be happy if he let himself.

You've got a hell of a bedside manner, doc.

if you only knew.

I think we better get out of here.

Let's get out of here.

I think it's clear.

00:55:1,600 --> 00:55:2,320
Jack.

00:55:2,920 --> 00:55:3,920
Oh, shit.

Rest in peace, you big-ass son of a bitch!

Quick, Jack!

Behind you!

Look out!

Get up!

(Jack grunts)

(Scorpion squeals)

Well, that was impressive.

So, what were you guys doing?

Oh, you know, we were just practicing while you were gone.

Good work.

Hey.

Listen, I need to get into the
cockpit.

So we got to figure out how to
get that big ass sumbitch out of there.

Mr. Jack!

Mr. Jack.

We have fashioned a weapon for
that exact Purpose!

Maybe we should be building
something to contain her.

Contain my ass.

Let's see what bad business my
Eastern Brothers here have built.

Here.

Bring it up.

I ain't got nothing to say.

No, I'm with the man

That's got the meeting. That
shit ain't gonna kill shit.

00:57:1,760 --> 00:57:5,479
Mr. Omar, you are not
seeing the whole picture.

00:57:5,480 --> 00:57:8,799
This is, this is just the body armor.

00:57:8,800 --> 00:57:10,000
It goes with this!

Here.

That's impressive.

This power pack goes on the
back and we have lined this

jumpsuit with new print for
insulation, but the user is

going to feel a little tingles

Uh, where did you get that neoprene?

Oh, we found a wetsuit Down
Below in one of the suitcases.

Oh man. That's mine, man.

We are sorry.

Mr. Omar, but you will be pleased
to know that we had no interest

whatsoever in many many pairs
of bright Underpants.

All right.

Hey, look, I'm not even trying
to hear this yall.

I'm gonna go kill these
motherfuckers myself.

No no.

No, Omar, wait!

Mr. Omar!

Okay, highball.

I have a rather urgent phone call to make.
Do you have a number for me?

Sorry boss. It looks like no one up there is
packing a cell phone.

00:58:0,160 --> 00:58:1,400
Well, how can that be?

00:58:1,720 --> 00:58:2,720
Cavemen.

00:58:3,400 --> 00:58:4,959
Did you check the crew?

00:58:4,960 --> 00:58:6,199
The crew?

00:58:6,200 --> 00:58:7,599
Oh shit!

00:58:7,600 --> 00:58:8,080
Curtis, I'm sorry.

00:58:8,081 --> 00:58:9,880
What did I tell you about that mouth, highball?

Sorry man.

Wait a minute.

Got it, Jack Russell the
captain just the man.

I need to speak to. Uh, Brick,

I need Randall Anderson at the
CIA.

Um, Try his home number.

You got it.

(Omar screams)

Why has this thing suddenly become so big?

Could you come, please.

Sit, sit, sit.

I want to talk to you

What about?

About the fact that
we're sitting here conspiring to

destroy everything that we made.

I mean, did you spend the last

00:59:0,600 --> 00:59:2,479
three years building something
up just so you could tear it down?

00:59:2,480 --> 00:59:4,960
Scott, what we've built kills people.

00:59:7,040 --> 00:59:9,039
Yeah, very effectively too.

00:59:9,040 --> 00:59:10,040
What?

Listen to me.

These insects are the only ones
of their kind.

We have an obligation to do whatever we
can to make sure that they do

not become extinct.

You'd rather
we become extinct?

What, so you and Cowboy Jack

are just going to shoot up
the saloon together?

Is that what this is?

God, I can't believe you're
going to make this about us.

Really?

This is not about us.

This is about the survival of
the people on this plane.

They don't -

This is about living.

Come on, don't you think I've seen

the way you two have been
mooning over each other ever

since you came on board.

and now, you're going to
merrily destroy everything.

I've worked my entire
fucking career to achieve.

I will not allow it!
Get up up up up.

Jack you got a got buddy.

01:00:0,080 --> 01:00:2,799
We could have been using at the
killer stays dead by now

01:00:2,800 --> 01:00:3,480
He doesn't want them dead.

Phillip!

Oh yeah, see what happens?

God, why? Why this?

You never gave me equity,
profit share, any control,

you know,

So I cut a deal for myself old
man.

Scott, this is crazy.

Sick bastard.


I never wanted this. I'm going to go.

Phillip!

Phillip, no!

01:01:4,360 --> 01:01:5,360
Hold on!

01:01:8,280 --> 01:01:10,080
Hold on, everybody hold on!

Jennifer, grab my hand!

Help me!

Jennifer, grab my hand. Grab my hand!

I'm slipping!

I can't hold on Jack!


Look at me, just hold on.

Come on!

01:02:4,680 --> 01:02:8,813
Pressure should start stabilizing soon. Come on, just hold on!

Wouldn't have been part of my plan, but it seems to have worked.

Phillip,

Oh God, Philip.

I can't believe that guy saved
my life.

So

are all The Nasty
creatures gone?

Is everybody alright?

I'm okay.

Shit, Scott.

Yeah, shit, Scott. Everybody up!

Get up, we've sitll got a plane to land.

Move it.

Get up! Jesus Christ!

Move, people!

Is this Randall Anderson?

01:03:3,080 --> 01:03:4,080
Randall this is Curtis Burch.

01:03:4,081 --> 01:03:5,600
I need a favor.

Guess I'm going to have to do this
the hard way.

What's the story, morning glory?

Well these are desperate
by Desperate Measures.

What do you want us to do?

The mother of all Hacks.

What's the target?

The CIA spy satellite control system.

control system.

All right, everyone remain

calm. We're not out of this
shit. right Captain Jack?

Right, but we'd all be able to think a
little more clearly if you just

put the gun down.

Yeah, no chance.

Okay, you're the boss.

01:04:2,880 --> 01:04:3,480
Can you land the plane?

01:04:5,800 --> 01:04:9,380
I still need to fix the landing
gear wiring in the avionics room.

How long until we reach Los Angeles?

An hour, maybe less

Okay.

Good. Good.

Good you go drive.

Did you not hear me?

I - what part did you miss?

I said that I still need to fix
the landing gear wiring in the avionics room.

Okay.

Cool.

You two go fix the landing
gear.

Jesus.

You crazy asshole.

There's a stack of three ring
binders as high as an

elephant's ass detailing the
wiring schematics.

It's good.

It sounds really complicated.

We can do it we can do it.

Hell, it'd take a damn near rocket
scientist to do it that quick.

I'm no rocket scientist.

We can do it!

01:05:1,800 --> 01:05:6,679
Mr. Jack, I and my brother came
for our Quest To America so

01:05:6,680 --> 01:05:12,239
far. We will fix that landing
gear or we will die trying.

See?

All right.

Looks like you're our only shot.

Let's see what you guys can do.

The wiring you're looking for.

The wire you're looking for, big
gray cables on the aft wall in the avionics room.

Good luck.

Jaffe.

Sedam.

Looks like we're going to need
a hell of a lot of it.

Yeah, I'm sure that one of them
can Scamper up here and ask you

some questions if they got a
fucking problem.

All right, Saddam Arafat get
your tools.

I will escort you to avionics.

Excuse me, sir.

Mr. Jack is

right. You are a crazy asshole!

01:06:1,800 --> 01:06:2,080
my tools.

01:06:4,080 --> 01:06:6,400
You have no idea.

Captain Jack, I'd like for you to remain seated for the remainder of the flight.

You- Shit!

Now, you move, move, move, God damn it, move.

We are doing it, We are doing it.

Get the fuck down there.

I think this has been sitting there a while, but
I had a lot of cream sugar.

Ooh, Wow, well, that's bad.

I think you missed your
calling.

Maybe you really should be a flight
attendant.

This is very complicated.

If we connect the wrong wire to
the circuit board, we may

fairly well melt the whole
thing.

We will do it brother.

We will do it.

01:07:3,320 --> 01:07:6,319
Yes, it would be a great help
to get captain Jake to guide us

01:07:6,320 --> 01:07:8,879
through this. We want Captain
Jake.

01:07:8,880 --> 01:07:9,856
Well you can't have him.

01:07:9,880 --> 01:07:11,959
All right, you said 'you can do
it.'

So do it.

Okay.

I have an idea, I have an idea.

You prepare and splice the
wires.

I will be right back.

Okay,

good luck

Uh, where are you going?

I'm going this way.

Good, I'm going to go with you, how is that?

Good, you will be useful. follow me. Come.

Hey.

I found this back there.

I figured you were probably
dying for a smoke.

01:08:4,960 --> 01:08:5,800
It actually survived all this.

01:08:8,880 --> 01:08:12,400
If we do, well, maybe I'll
think about quitting smoking.

Hello, Hello, testing.

Testing, 1 2 3

Mr. Scott you take this to mr.

Jack for communication.

I will help my brother Sedam.

Yeah, very very good.

Yeah, you do that you go

Help Sedam,

All right? and no funny
business.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes no funny business.

I know you are a very evil and
scary man now go please go.

Please please fast, we want
communication.

I'm sorry about what I said
back there.

I think it's incredible that
you still hold your wife in

01:09:2,880 --> 01:09:4,158
your heart.

01:09:4,160 --> 01:09:5,080
There's no reason to get rid of
that.

01:09:9,319 --> 01:09:9,880
Thanks for saying that.

She would have really liked you.

Thanks.

So, Here I am again with other
people's lives in my hands.

And it goes with the job,
doesn't it?

Right.

Thanks.

I'll get us down

You better.

No, no no. Sorry to interrupt this Magic Moment,
but I want you focused on landing

the darn plane.
You yeah, get up! come on.

01:10:0,000 --> 01:10:0,856
It's for you.

01:10:1,680 --> 01:10:2,680
(radio static)

01:10:2,920 --> 01:10:3,920
Captain Jack!

01:10:4,480 --> 01:10:4,960
Sedam?

01:10:5,360 --> 01:10:6,360
Captain Jack.

01:10:7,400 --> 01:10:8,320
Well damnation.

Scott what is wrong with you?

What the hell are you doing?

Are you proud of yourself?

Well, this certainly is a
magnificent fucking catastrophe

but very definitely not what I
had in mind.

What you had in mind? Jesus
Christ you were going to sell

us all out.

What can I say?

What can I say? You and Phillip never
truly appreciated the market

value of the technology.

You bastard. People died because
of your greed.

01:11:0,320 --> 01:11:7,599
Ooh, ain't that just too damn
bad. And all for nothing too, seeing

01:11:7,600 --> 01:11:8,600
as all the specimens are gone.

01:11:8,601 --> 01:11:11,439
Thanks to Grandpa.

Phillip you asshole!

Ah ah ah ah ah, sit bitch.

Look at me. Good girl.

Alright, girlfriend.

You keep your eyes open.

If there is one fucking specimen left on

his plane.

I am going to have more money
than God

God don't need money.

Good, more for me.

(hatch opens)

Oh my...

Jack!


01:12:5,960 --> 01:12:6,960
Oh, darling.

01:12:9,680 --> 01:12:11,080
Yes sir, that's mine.

Yeah, The exo skeleton is slightly mutilated, and the left

pelipad is lopsided little bit.

But over all i'd say she's damned sexy.

Jack, are you alright?

Oh my god.

I've been better. Jenna, I can't
see.

Courtney.

Stay here and help Jack see what
he needs to see, and wrap something

around his eyes.

But where are you going?

Somebody has to kill that thing.

01:13:2,719 --> 01:13:4,587
It's the green motherfucker.

01:13:6,120 --> 01:13:7,920
Captain Jack! Captain Jack!

Jaffe!

Jaffe!

Come on Jaffe. Come on.

Holy shit.

Holy shit.

We're in.

Holy shit, we're in!, We're in!

Holy shit!

Curtis!

Okay, what have we got?

Well, apparently we have a CIA
spy satellite.

Holy shit!

The mouth on this guy.

Good, good work.

I'm okay brother

I'm okay.

You must finish the job,

01:14:1,719 --> 01:14:2,719
But Jaffe, I-

01:14:3,120 --> 01:14:4,120
But nothing.

01:14:4,559 --> 01:14:7,280
The life of many people on this plane is in our hands.

01:14:9,760 --> 01:14:11,159
Youu have to save them.

I will try, brother.

Try hard, try hard.

Come on, do it!

(electricity arcing)

It's beautiful.

It's beautiful?

Where did she go?

That way.

Are you alright?

I will live if we land.

But first we have to kill the
bitch.

Count on it.

The fibrillator only

carries enough power for a
short jolt. Brother in order for

us to kill the beast,

We need something, a larger
battery, something-

A larger battery?

I've got an idea.

No, not the old APU sister.

That much will kill you sister.

Fix the plane.

I'll be back.

01:15:0,840 --> 01:15:2,840
Say what you want. That girl got
moxie.

Captain Jack, Captain Jack, can
you hear me?

01:16:2,639 --> 01:16:3,639
Loud and clear.

01:16:3,960 --> 01:16:7,679
Captain Jack, the primary and
secondary couplings are sliced and bound.

01:16:7,680 --> 01:16:11,680
We are definitely ready to start reconnecting.

Okay running up
the right side of the Box

you're gonna see a series of connectors, do you see them?

Yes, I do.

Good.

Captain Jack, there are many connectors, which one?

I need you to have them wire tested until you find an open line.

I cannot do this.

We will do it, brother.

Thank you Jaffe.

Satellite is in position
matching speed and trajectory.

Thank you, brick.

Operator.

Yes, sir.

I'd like to place a
person-to-person call, please.

Yes, sir.

What the hell?

Courtney, grab that.

It's in my bag.

Hello?

Curtis Burnham.

This is
Courtney.

Hey, um, we're in a lot of trouble
up here.

01:17:2,559 --> 01:17:3,559
Yeah, yeah, he is.

01:17:3,600 --> 01:17:5,398
Uh, hold on.

01:17:5,400 --> 01:17:6,800
It's for you.

Hello?

Who is this angel of mercy?

Well, what's left of him.

Who's this?

Well, I never thought that I'd be
happy getting a call from the FAA.

Okay, Captain.

I need you to accelerate your
descent.

You're at about 6,000 feet now.

Courtney, what's our altimeter reading now?

Ah, 3,000.

Wait Curtis you're saying
we're at 6,000 feet?

Damn, it Curtis my altimeter's

malfunctioning. It says 3,000
feet, so

you're gonna have to call the
ball from here.

Alright, okay.

Courtney,

relay my, my altitude.

Okay.

01:18:1,080 --> 01:18:2,879
All right, Captain just follow
my lead.

01:18:2,880 --> 01:18:5,478
You're going to need to power
die for short bursts.

01:18:5,480 --> 01:18:7,359
I'll count it off for you.

01:18:7,360 --> 01:18:7,800
Are you ready?

01:18:7,800 --> 01:18:9,799
Everybody grab something and
squeeze it now.

01:18:9,800 --> 01:18:10,800
Now!

Oh shit!


5,000.

Five-thousand.

Forty-five hundred.

Forty-five hundred.

Four-thousand.

Four thousand

Get ready to level off... now!

Oh god.

(Scorpion squeals)

Look at her.

01:20:1,520 --> 01:20:2,200
Isn't she beautiful?

01:20:4,040 --> 01:20:5,040
Hey, babe.

01:20:5,320 --> 01:20:8,080
Guess that's why I'm Not Dead yet.

01:20:8,160 --> 01:20:9,199
Oh, god.

01:20:9,200 --> 01:20:10,200
So apparently,

through the years of all the minor stings from the scorpions we were using in the lab.

I've developed an immunity to the venom.

you know, Not completely, you know, obviously

I feel a little bit, you know.

it's like, whew.

a rush, it's a rush.

That gun's empty Scott.

(gun cocks)

You were saying?

Dammit.

Jaffe, Sedam, I need to land
now.

Guys!

I don't know which connector

Pick one.

we have no time.

But Jaffe, I can't, I-

01:21:0,680 --> 01:21:1,200
You can do it.

01:21:2,160 --> 01:21:4,427
I'm not going to let you hurt her.

01:21:4,960 --> 01:21:6,893
I'm not going to let you undo

01:21:8,200 --> 01:21:9,267
what' I've done.

She's perfection.

She's my little girl.

She's mine.

You can have her.

(Scott screaming)

Jaffe, Sedam, I need to land now!

Come on, guys.

Yeah, Allah.

Do it.

01:22:4,440 --> 01:22:5,919
Courtney, how close are we?

01:22:5,920 --> 01:22:9,719
I see the runway,
and I can see some cars, they look like

toys, it's not like I have
something to compare them to.

Tell me when we get closer. Are we straight, are we lined up on the runway?

We're just about straight, we're straight. We're straight.

Are you sure?

Yes!

Three, two, one,

Now.

We've done it. Yes.

Thank you for flying with us.

We stopped.

Yeah, means the plane is on the
ground.

Congratulations.

Not bad Cowboy.

Hello, Jennifer

Is it dead?

Better than dead.

Nice work.

You too.

Thanks,

but Courtney did it all.

Come on, Let's

get me out of this damn crate.

Yaffe.

We are in America.

Yes. Yes.

01:24:3,440 --> 01:24:4,907
Oh, what's that noise?

01:24:6,200 --> 01:24:6,880
Leonard

01:24:8,719 --> 01:24:9,719
Oh, oh shit.

01:24:9,960 --> 01:24:10,960
Ah!

Omar?

You know what, that ain't right,
locking a brother up in that thing for hours.

We thought you were dead.

No,

I went and I was hunting those
things down.

I had my screwdriver and
I killed like five or six of

them out there it was crazy!

How the hell did you get up there?

I don't know.

Better get you to a hospital.

Ah, I'll be fine.

Let's say me and you, ditch this
plane, and we go get a place.

You know, I know Tantra.

I know Karate.

01:25:2,960 --> 01:25:6,693
Well, in that case, I bet you're dying for one of these.

I just quit.

Really?

Yeah, I finally got a reason to.

Come on, let's go cowboy.
