This is "the comedy central

Roast of roseanne barr" brought

To you by...

and now welcome your roast

Master, jane lynch!

[cheers & applause]

Hello.

Hello.

Thank you!


Thank you!

Thank you.

Good evening, everyone.

I'm jane lynch.

Welcome to the comedy central

Roast of roseanne!

Goodness

What a night.

Roseanne, ellen barkin, casey

Segal, carrie fisher.

It's like a menopausal palooza:

This show is serving up more old

Spoiled hens than a chick-fil-a.

Oh, that reminds me.


And roseanne is referred t as

Just one name, bitch!

Ellen barkin is here.

Huh?


Ellen, your sxcene is "sea of

Love" is the reason I'm a

Lesbian.

Nothing like seeing al pacino's

Bare as on the screen to make a

Girl want to eat [bleep] like

She's about to be executed.

Carrie fisher is here!

[cheers & applause]

Now, carrie's here to put

Roseanne's weight and drug

Problems into perspective.

Carrie was one of the hottest

Actresses in hollywood.

Tt was long ago in a galaxy

Far, far away.

One of the good ones.

Wayne brady is here.

[cheers & applause]

Now, wayne, you're going to hear

A lot of jokes about how you're

Not a real black man.

I want you to know, I still hid

My purse.

Good, good.


But enough about these vile

Degenerate failures.

Before we bring roseanne out

Tonight, let's take a look back

At her many career highlights so

Her viewers under the age of 20

Can stop asking who the [bleep]

She is

roseanne barr.

A husband thinks a wife knows

where every thing is.

Like a uterus is a tracking

device.


I like that joan jett.

I can't even remember the

last time we had sex.

I can.

That's why we ain't doing it.

When I was 12 years old, I

Signe a deal because I wanted

To get famous no matter what.

You ever sorry we got

Married?

Every second of my life.

Why are you so mean?

Because I hate kids.

She starred in the

Ground-breaking show,

"roseanne," she never shied away

From contentious issues.

It featured the first lesbian

Kiss on tv.

And then I had this tragic

Singing accident.

Oh, yeah.

ï½¶ and the home of the brave ï½¶

disgusting.

So anti-american.

Scratching herself and

Spitting.

The nationa anthem?

I don't think so.

You think I'm pretty?

Don't say that on television.


So those macadamia nuts...

those are my nuts.

I need to run for president.

I'm not kidding.

This is america, land of the

Free.

I have to call my

Psychiatri.

That's what makes me me.

I can't begin to tell you

What a privilege it is for you

To have me here tonight.

Let's start this show!

[cheers & applause]

She is a personal inspiration

To me an an absolute comedic

Genius.

Please welcome america's

Domestic goddess, roseanne!

[cheers & applause]

Hi, gilbert.

Hi, carrie.

Awesome entrce.

Awesome.

Hi, honey.

Hello darling.

Oh,

hi!

[cheers & applause]

Roseanne, it's greato

Finally meet you.

You know, I waved to you outside

But realized it was one of

Those inflating parking lot

Gorillas.

What a huge mark you've made on

The entertainment industry.

There your ground-breaking

Show "roseanne" and then

There'... yes!


And then of urse there's

Reruns of "roseanne."

And having a hit show finally

Allowed you to do what you truly

Love to do, fire people.


Let's not forget your movie

Career like the rest of america.

You co-starred in "she devil"

With meryl stree

That movie got 2 1/2 stars jt

Like this stage.

Of course, you've experienced

Controversy.

Everybody remembers your version

Of the star spangd banner.

What could have predicted your

Beautiful speaking voice

Wouldn't translate to singing.

In your defense, you said there

Was something wrong with the

Sound system that y.

There was.

It had been turned on.

Then you moved on to spiritual

Pursuits.

Roseanne, you're a jew that

Converted to more man, that

Converteto kablah and in

1990 you converted to white

Trash when you mried tom

Arnold.

Now, roseanne, it's not your

Fault you're attracted to tom.

You saw with all that white

Powder on his upper lip, there

Must be a doughnut somewhere.


Roseanne said she had plastic

Surgery to get away from tom

Arnold much like a nonazy

Peon would use a car.


By the way, tom arnold wted to

Be here tonight but at the last

Minute nobody asked him.


I really don't know a lot about

Roseanne's current boyfriend.

I do know one thing.

He's into fat chicks.


Roseanne, you've admitted to

Having multiple personalities.

It's amazing you couldn't find

One that was likeable.

And it's true that roseanne goes

Off the grid from time to time.

This allows the grid to maiain

Its structural integrity.


But this year she's announced

Her campaign for presidency.

[cheers & applause]

Mitt romney sent roseanne

Flowers for making him the

Second most hated morman in the

Race.

Like joan of arc, you'r a

Strong wman that has a lot to

Say.

Fears nothing and whose ass is

About to go up in flames.

Let's bring out your first

Roaste

[cheers applause]

Our first roaster is amy

Schumer.

[cheers & applause]

Now, amy didn't have to blow

Someone to be on the stage

Tonight, but she insisted on it.


Ladies and gentlemen, let's get

Her out of the way, amy schumer.


Oh, eat a dick, jane.


Try it.


Look at this stage.

Roseanne, ellen, jane, kate.

You are like the women's

Gymnastic teams.

Tired, sweeting.

You don't getour period

Anymore.

I haven't seen this much skin

Since jane lynch's circumcision.


I don't want to mess wh you,

Jane.

I know your fans would eat my



I'm sorry.

I cannot stop looking at ellen

Barkin.

You're so sexy.

Jane, isn't it weird to see what

You would look like as a woman?


Weird.

I think it's weird.

Wayne brady is here.


Wayne, you're crazy talented.

You're so brilliant.

Why doesn't anyone care?

No one up here can do what you

Do

When someone mentioned whos

Line is it anyway?

Carrie fisher yells out "mine"!


Because you're a drug addict.

Right.


Now, carrie, you've had more

Lines than a crippled kid at

Disneyland.


Ellen barkin is here.

Ellen caught a lot of flak for

Dating a man half her age.

So what?

You're dating a 43-year-old!


I don't see the problem.

Ellen has married some of the

Richest men in the world.

I'm not saying she's a gold

Digger, but she ain't messing

With no broke wayne bradys.

You know what I'm saying?

Ellen has been quote as saying

She slept her way to the middle.

You've inspired women to put

Their best clit forward.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Seth, a clit is this small...

You won't need to worry about

It.

Take it down.

Seth is here representing the

Lollipop guild.

Thank you!


For over 30 years, seth green

Has been one of hollywood's top

Child actors.


Speaking of children, gilbert,

God, you look like a tony asian

Kid.

Hang around long enough and jane

And her wife will try to adopt

You!


Jeff ross, still gross.

Jeff ross.


Jeff, you look lik krusty the

Clown dressed as joe paterno.


Thk it will help for all your

Work at children's parties.

Is that a rape whistle?


Jeff, you look worse than when I

Started this sentence.

How did you do that?


Which brings me to michael

Moore... mean, roseanne barr.


I'm such a fan.

Roseanne bought a nut farm, a

Nut farm, which is also the name

For ellen barkin's mouth in an

Audition.


Amy, what did I do to you?

You just swallowed a ton of

Ejaculate.

That's all I'm saying.

Roseanne, you have the voice of

A parakeet and the face of a

Much fatter parakeet.

You know you're unattractive

When sara gilbert is eye candy

On the set.

You loo gorgeous.

I was surprised you were running

For president.

I thin a lot of people couldn't

Picture you like running.


Truthfully, you've been making

People laugh and feel better for

As long as I can remember.

You're a personal hero.

I'mhonored to be here.

Thanks so much.

[cheers & applause]

Thank you.

That's funny.

The comedy central roast of

Roseanne is brought to you by...

coming up, seth green, katey

Segal, wayne brady, carrie


Our next roaster is seth

Green.

Seth is the man he is today

Because his mom smokes during

Pregnancies.

Please welcome the only peron

Here tonight, the only person

That wants another austin powers

Movie, seth green!

Wow, jane lynch.

Seriously, you're one of my

Favorite comic actors.

Jane lynch is the funniest man

In america.

I'm real rady for you to come

Up here and do your stupid jokes

About my height.

I have a job.

It's on cartoon network.

But I don't have to sleep a yea

And wait or the the next roast.

Carrie fisher is here.


Carrie and I go way back to the

First austin powers movie where

She played a therapist.

There's no irony there.


Carrie used to be paid a lot to

Take work as a screen writer.

Now the only scripts she takes

Are from a friend's medicine

Cabinet.


I'm reall glad you're here.

It's a nerd's dream to be on the

Same show as carrie fisher and

Amy schumer.

Princess leah and princess blow

Ya.

Amy, you have a part in the new

Steve carell movie.

Congratulations.

A great change for your usual,

Seeking a dick for the end of

The night.


I can't believe ellen barkin is

Here tonight.


I got so excited when s looked

At me back stage with that sexy

Crooked smile.

Actually wasn'ture if she was

Saying I'm io or hell, I'm

Having a stroke!


Ff ross is an old friend.

He's got a new show on roasting

The news.

It would be perfect for people

Who find jon stewart handsome

And funny.


People have said wayne brady

Isn't black enough.

He got a job as a game show

Host.

That's going to show them.

Gilbert gottfried, I don't know

Why you squint a lot.

We're the ones that have to look

At you.


Katey segal, I've known you

Since you did married with

Children when I was doing "the

Fact of life."

Now you're a star on the sons of

Anarchy.

I'm here for roseanne, our guest

Of honor.


Roseanne, you need another show.

You're spending too much time on

Twitter.

It's annoying.

I tweet a lot but you tweet more

Than big bird when he's getting

Ass raped.


Okay.

Last time I saw roseanne, she

Was in a snickers commercial.

Because that's what america is

Thinking.

I want to eat what she's eating!


Most of all, I love princess

Leia strangle you with a chain

At the end of return of the

Jedi.

Most of all.

I love you.

Oh, thank you.

Our next roaster is katey

Sega.


You may remember her for her

Sitcom "married with children."

She's currently starring in sons

Of anarchy as vicious

Criminal.

She's finally here to kill her

Career.

Please welcome katey segal.


Thank you, jane.

I have been a fan of your work

Since you were cutting down the

Redwood with your big blue ox.

I'm not sure if u know this,

But jane came out to her parents

In a letter.

There hasn't been a letter that

Unnecessary since the p in

Pneumonia.

Ellen barkin is here.

Ellen, you're a survivor.

When your second marriage fell

Apart, you didn't sit around

Feeling sorry for yourself.

You took your $40 million...

20.

Your $20 million

Settlement... whatever!

My kids think they're richer

Than we are.

You took all that money and

You paid someone else to sit

Around and feel sorry for you.

And amy schumer

You know, this business can

Really be tough on women.

Many of them develop eating

Disorders in an effort to be

Thin.

Just a suggestion.


Speaking of things that are

Thin, it's so good to see seth

Green.

Seth, you being here marks the

First time someo your size has

Beenn comedy central without

Jeff dunham's hand up their ass.


It's also reallyyoodo s

Wayne brady.

Wayne is kind of talented, kind

Of funny and kind of black meet.

And then there's jane lynch.

Jane, you were named one of

Power up's ten amazing gay women

In show biz.

Quite an honor even in there are

Only seven of you.


Jeff ross was also on the list

After they confused him for

Being a lesbian.

Ands will for being in show biz.


And I have to say it's great to

See roseanne back in the

Spotlight.

Thank you!

Thank you, katey.

I mean, you know, technically

It's two spotlights.

But you get the idea.

Roseanne was a trail-blazing

Comedy icon that created the

Character of an irrevent smart

Talking mom that nobody had ever

Seen sce I did it on "married

With children" the year before.

[cheers & applause]

Roseanne broke into the reality

World with "roseanne's nuts."

The show about her and johnny

Argent running a macadamia farm.

Roseanne, I feel honored that

You and I broke grou for tv

Moms that didn't cook, didn't

Clean and didn't make any money.

In the 90s, it makes you a bad

Mom.

Today it makes you mitt romney's

Wife.

[cheers & applause]

As an advocate for justi,

You're willi to speak for the

Voiceless many as well as the

Manyvoices.

All of whom are in your head.

Telling you to eat it, [bleep]

It, fire it or run for

President.

Roseanne, thank you so much for

Asking me to be a part of this.

Thank you!

Still to come, jeff ross.

You look so good in my joke

You night not work.

Carrie fisher and wayne

Brady.

I want you to tweet me.

I want to tweet you.

Let's do that.

I'm going to tweet you so h


Our nxt roaster is jeff

Ross.


Jeff jus finished a national

Score.

He's the only man that has

Jerked off in more theatershan

Fred willard.

Please, welcome the roastmaster

General, jeff ross!


Yeah!

Fantastic!

Give it up for your host

Tonight, denis leary.


I think chris is here from

Lee."

This is so cool.

I love "glee."

Jane, it's my favorite show.

It is.

Except for the one time they let

You sing.

I haven't heard sounds that

Disturbing since I hung out in

Sandusky's basement.

Too soon for the "glee" joke?


Folks, if you're offended by

What you see tonight, just do

What joe paterno did.

Look the other way.

Again, jane, thanks for hosting.

You're probably the most beloved

Person in comedy right now.

Before the show, I even heard

The crowd chanting "lynch,

Lynch."

And that was just during wayne

Brady's introduction.


Please, is that wayne brady or

Didl jolson forget to take off

His makeup?

How did you make a career out of

Corporate teen-building

Exercises?

If you're just tuning in, no,

This is not a lifetime original

Movie.


Thank you.

Ellen barkin, you always been

Ahead of your time.

Voted hottest woman over 30 at

Age 36.

Carrie fisher, make yourself

Comfortable.

Chain yourself to roseanne's

Chair.

What does that mean?

I don't get that.

It's a [bleep] star wars

Joke.

Oh, I don't get it.

You should know.

You're dressed like yoda's

Grandma.


I'm telling you, this roast

Stuff doesn't take commercial

Breaks.

It takes a menopause.


And anthony, I'm hearing you're

Very excited about your new

Pilot.

John travolta.


I see the world's uglyist


Here tonight.

You look like benjamin button

When he was 6.


Gilbert has kept a low profile

Since he was fired from aflec

For an insensitive tweet.

Gilbt, if you want an

Insensitive tweet, tweet about

Ellen barkin's makeup.

Too soon, too soon.

No, too good.

You look beautiful.

I have to hand it to you, you

Have been torchered and abused

All night and still hanging in

There.

Roseanne, I'm not talking to

You.

I'm talking about the chair

You're sitting on.


Oh, wait.

You know what?

Normally when I roast a pig, it

Has an apple in its mouth.


After our last roast, I said, we

Need someone bigger than charlie

Sheen.

This isn't what I meant.


Last year we roasted charlie.

This year we're roasting the

Chocolate factory.

What?

What is that joke?

You want me to explain the


I didn't hear it.

It means your fat.

Oh, okay.

I'm looking forward to your new

Show, "tons of anarchy."

Instead ofunning for

President, why don't you try

Walking on a treadmill?


I'd vote for you but I'm against

Big government.


Roseanne joined the green party

Because she was kicked out of

The tea party for eating all the

Crumpets.


Nice one!

How manyersonalities you

Have?

Eight, nine?

At are the odds they are all


Comedy comes from pain, people.

And nobody knows tt better

Than this woman.

The legendary roseanne barr.

[cheers & applause]

She was molested as a child.

Oh, that poor molester.


Roseanne neverot over it.

She felt violated.

She had trust issues.

She never got the candy he

Promised her.


Roseanne, I'll always love you

For saying whatever you want,

For never holding back.

In these alarming times when

Comedians are second guessing

Their imaginations and sometimes

Even apologizing for jokes, I

Conside you a hero and a martyr

And a friend.

Thank you.

Thanks very much.

I love you.

[cheers & applause]

W, I'm going to take seth

Green and hit thshowers!

Up next, carrie fisher,

Anthony jeselnik and wayne

Brady.

That's one of the black

Handshake


Our next roaster is wayne

Brady.

Wayne said he got his

Inspiration when he watched a

Summer camp production of "hello

Dolly" and thought that's what I

Want to do, be gay!


Please welcome wayne brady.


Thank you so much, jane.

Now, this is comedy central.

Don't make me choke a butch.

Just saying.

Just saying

Just want to let you know.

There's no giving away of

Prizes, none of that stuff.

No making up songs.

I'm about to tell the truth on

This mother [bleep] stage here

Tonight.

I have to preach a little bit.

I have to preach.

Carriefisher.

Carrie, you're the only

Celebrity whose action figure is

Worth more than you are.


Ellen barkin.

So good to see you.

You are hot.

So ellen, pture me, you, red

Wine, candlelight, a time

Machine.


No, I would [bleep] you.

And schumer, I wouldn't [bleep]

You.

I wouldn't [bleep] you if you

Used watermelon flavor flavorel

While watering a fried chicken g

String.

I wouldn't.

You couldn't get a black dude to


Set of a brand new tyler perry

Movie call "how to get black

Dude to [bleep] you."


That's okay.

That's all right.

Jeff ross.

Oh, by the way, those al jolson

Jokes go over big with kids.

Yeah.

You're current as [bleep].


Now, the thing is, jeff, these

Are all jokes and I really like

You.

Really, really like you but a

Lot of people hate you.

Especially sarah palin.

Because you remindmer of what

Trying is going to look like

When he's 40.


And... and now you boo me.


I don't want to hear this.

You don't boo me because of

Trig.

And now to the reason we're all

Here.

Roseanne barr.


You have overcome a lot to make

It in hollywood.

That's why I love you.

Bad marriages, mental illness,

Plus you look like roseanne.


You're oversized, beat up and

You wreak of marijuana.

That's seth ross.

You're kind of like willie

Nelson's tour bus, except people

Still want to ride that.

And now, all that being said, I

Really think that your a comedic

Gem and I thank you for letting

Me be here.

On behalf of intelligent

Brothers everywhere, you can

Suck my black [bleep].

Good night.

Thanks so much.

You're so funny.

Our next roaster is carrie

Fisher.


She became famous with

Travelling into space.

Now she can be seen from it.

May the force help her get out

Of that seat, pase welcome

Carrie fisher!

Okay.

Thank you.

Ere's nothing funier than a

Good menstruation joke.

Unfortunately there hasn't been

Any tonight.

But okay.

So I'm carrie.

I'm a alcoholic.

Okay.

Roseanne... I can't say oops,

Wrong room!

Roseanne, when they first asked

Me to do the show tonight, I

Said y?

And then ty explained that we

Were good friends and that we

Apparently have worked together.


Did younow I wrote and episode

Of your show?

I do.

I didn't know that but...


It must be true.

Read it online next to the

Posting about how much I look

Like elton john.


As you may have noticed about

Me yes, I do have big tits buts

Will I'm mentally ill.

Yay!

Thank you, thank you.

Makes this a lot easier, believe

Me.

But you know, I'm not the only

One.

Jeff ross.

God, you give so much of

Yourself entertaining our troops

Overseas.

Not by doing standup.

They just like watching fat guys

Get out of helicopters.

There you go.


Eaking of electro convulsive

Therapy.

I learned two things tonight

Bumping into seth green back

Stage.

He is a big star wars fan.

And I apparently was in star

Wars.


So amazing!

That must have been great.

You know... now, wayne brady,

How a you?

You're so white that I tried to

Snort you back stage, didn't I?

I'm sorry.


Wow!

Now, I have seen gilbert

Gottfried at 12-step meetings.

He was not actually there.

They held a picture up of him

And they said, if you [bleep]

This man, a, how humiliating for

You and b, you must be a

Alcoholic.


At least I hope so.

Jane...

love yo carrie.

Oh, dear, I love you, too.

I do love you on "glee."

I do.

It's a change to see a coach

That doesn't take showers with

Little boys.

Hey, wait a mite!

What?

What?

You're going to take exception

To that?

You did that joke.

No, no, no.

Not that?

N

I'moing to do another

Period joke and another white

Joke, short joke, old women

Joke.


Okay.

So...


Yeah.

[cheers & applause]

Hilarious!

Anthony jeselnik, I've heard

That you are a pretty gutsy guy.

You say what other rapists only

Think.

You don't get your period

Anymore, do you?

God, I could laugh about that

All night.

Now, I'm going to talk about

Someone I have a lot of history

With.

Someone who has always been

There for me... not really, but

Roseanne.

You know, roseanne and I, we're

Both feminists, am I right?

You're right.


That's it.

You know, we think women can do

Anything that men can do.

In fact, we were discussing this

Earlier at the urinal.

Remember that?


Okay.

Roseanne, you battled the voices

In your head to become one of

The greatest comedians and

Become one of the greatest

Sitcom stars of all time.

If I had to come up with a

Reason why I love you so much,

It would have to be because I

Have done so much dope that I

Have no idea who the [bleep] you

Are.

Or who I am or where I am.


Thank you!

[cheers & applause]

Coming up, ellen bain.

I'm a stand up comic.

And anthony jeselnik.

Ur next roaster is an tony

Jeselnik.


This fellow is famous for his

One-liners like "I never touched

Her."

"I have an alibi."

Or "talk to my lawyer

Clap your hands or pretend like

You recognize an tony jeselnik.


Thank you, thank you.

When comedy central asked me to

Be here tonight, I told them to

[Suck mybleep].

Now I'm here.


Jane lynch, I love yourshow,

"glee."

No matter how I think it's going

To turn out, there's never a

School shooting.

My good friend jeff ross is all

Dressed up tonight.

Yeah, man.

Jeff, you look like something

A mongoliod kid put together at

Build a bear.


Katey segal.

Katey, you're a incredible

Actor.

You worked on "married with

Children."

A show that changed comedy.

"Sons of anarchy."

The show that took drama to a

New level.

And "eight simple rules".

The show that killed john

Ritter.


Wow!

Boo, bitches, boo!

Seth green is here

Everybody has that one weird

Creepy uncle?

Well, seth green looks like he

Got raped by all of them.

Ellen barkin, baby doll.

You're upcoming tv show, "the

New normal" premiers on

September 11.

Yeah.

September 11th.

That sounds about right.


I never thought of that!

Every clip I've seen feels

Like I'm watching a third tower

Collapse.

Suck it!

And wayne brady.

Wayne, I don't understand why

People keep joking that you're

Not black.

Wayne brady, you are black!

After all, I only remember you

For all of t years you played

An uppity slave on "whose line

Is it anyway."


I was good.

I was good.

Now for the lady of honor,

Miss roseanne barr.

[cheers & applause]

Oh, boy, I can't wait!

Roseanne, your bid for

President was a failure.

You said that you'd like to

Become prime minister of israel

One day.

That could happen.

Those people are [bleep] idiots.


Roseanne, even though you're a

Feminist icon, so many men have

Gotten rich off of you.

Tom arnold, john goodman, the

Guy who owns the cheesecake

Factory.


And roseanne, you were knnotoris

For being a tyrant on your

Sitcom.

In fact, the entire cast and

Crew always had to wal on

Eggshells around you because you

Could not stop eating eggs.

Here's something positive.

You had gastric bypass surgery

In 1998 and then youeat it.

[cheers & applause]

But roseanne, despite everything

I just said, there's not a comic

Alive who doesn't owe a great

Debt to you.

You're a great sport for being

Here tonight.

Thank you for being here tonight

And letting me be here too.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Our next roaster is ellen

Barkin.

[cheers & applause]

Older vwers might noel len

From "diner" or "sea of love

Younger viewers might know her

From [bleep] her.


Ellen stars in the nbc sitcom

"the new normal" which critics

Are already describing as

Cancelled.


Ladies and gentlemen, please

Welcome ell barkin.

[cheers & applause]

Thank you, jane.

I had a cocktail before I came

On.

I admit it.

And then I had three more

Cocktails


And then I had a valium.

I was very scared and very

Intimidated by being surrounded

By real comedians here tonight.

Luckily the [bleep] jeff ross is

Here.

That was a relief.

I hear you have a n show.

Yeah.

Yeah?

Don't you think you should say

Thank you to roseanne for paving

The way for bus-size women for

Getting their own tv shows?

You're right.


Katey, my little peg bundy.

Hi, len.

How does it feel to go

Through lifenown as that horny

Red head that could never get

Laid?

Seth green, same question.


And gilbert gottfried.

I am so glad you could take a

Break from starring directly

Into the sun to be with us

Tonight.


But now it's time to turn our

Attention to the sexiest [bleep]

Bitch on this stage.

Miss roseanne barr!

[cheers & applause]

Now, roseanne, I'm only here

Because shon stone dropped out

And w all know how hilarious

That [bleep].


Hat's not true.

Roseanne, it was very

Important for me to be here for

You.

Do you remember that [bleep]

Bitch that tweeted at me and

Called me a [bleep] crazele

Robbing washed up s-been pig

Who should find a man my own age

Instead of parading around with

Some boy toy that I would never

Get if I didn't used to be

Famous in the 80s?

In the end, roseanne, in my

Defense, she took to twitter and

She told that [bleep] bitch,

Shut the [bleep] up!

[cheers & applause]

Now, graned, I was with that

Woman's son at the time.


It was late and he did have

Homework that night.

But there was no way I was

Letting that little hairless

Play thing out ofy sandbox.


My frie, roseanne, you are a

Pionr.

You became an icon for female

Comics, for working mothers, for

All women.

And then you married that

Jittery coke head and you



Oh we.

I love you.

I love you too.

Thank you!

The comedy central roast of

Roseanne is brought to you by...

still to come, roseanne gets

A surprise visit from her ex.

This is the best for mat to

Do


Wow!

Okay.

So I was just told we have a

Last-minute guest that stopped

By to say a few words.

Ladies and gentlemen, tom

Arnold.

[cheers & applause]

[cheers & applause]

Oh shit.

She's right beside me, isn't

She?

You know, hi.

We... we have not been in the

Same room for over 18 ars.

Yay!

Yeah.


I'm not here to tear roseanne a

New one.

Quite frankly, I've seen the old

One.

It is spectacular.

It could use little paint,

Maybe a couple plants in the

Corners, a wicker love seat.

Trust me, that baby is move-in

Ready!


Trt.

Why am I here?

Well, I'm here to honor roseanne

And I'm here because I [bleep]

Earned it the hard way.


Have any of you guys eve

Wrestled her?

Huh?

I have.

Has she sent any of you to pair

Mount to beat up anybody over

Fat jokes?

I did.

How many of you been arrested at

Lax for defending her singing?

This guy right here.


Have you ever had her pull a

Knife on you for spting on her

Diet cookies?

Yes.

Yes.

That's right.


Have you ever been sucker

Punched in the face by her purse

In front of bob hope and his

Frickin' 90th birthday party?

Yes.

Not.

Yes, you did.

Yes, it's true.

At oneime we we obviously

Very, very close.

When I was with roseanne... and

She's talk about this a lot...

She had 27 personalities.

Only two of them liked me.

One of those was a small german

Boy.


Rosy and I were once

Inseparable.

We lived together, we worked

Together, we even got tattoos

Together.

You remember.

I got rosy's face tattooed on my

Chest.

Believe me, it's hard to get a

Woman to have sex with you when


Her.

True.

It's harder to masturbate.


You know, rosie, it's true.

She had "property only tom

Arnold" tattooe on her hip

Which made me the fourth largest

Prerty owner in california


Now that I'm allegedly sober and

We're both in stable

Relationips...


I want you to know, rosie,

There's no reason to be jealous

Of my wife, ashley.

She's tall and thin and wasn't

Born when we were married.

And I learned fromour mistake.

I made her sign a prenup.

That was so good.

Right.


I just want to say something

About yourboyfriend, johnny.

Johnny, I want to say this to

You, man.

No matter what, you have to stay

With this woman.

She maynot be the perfect wife

But she's the worst ex-wife on

The planet.

Literally!


You don't want to be a guy lying

On his couch with a date and

Hear how small your dick is on

"Saturday night live."

And then "the view."

And cnn and al-jazeera.

She holds a grudge, people!

You kw what?

Recently roseanne got in trouble

For accidentally wishing cancer

On chick-fil-a customers.

But...


Accidentally.

But you guys can all rela

If she had the power to wish

Cancer on anyone, I would have

Been [bleep] dead in 94.

You know, I met roseanne 30

Years ago.

You know?

Remember that?

That's right?

Yeah.

30 years ago.

First time I saw you perform I

Knew you were one of the

Greatest.

When I got off stage, you said

To me, you sure are a funny son

Of a bitch.

I said thanks.

You want to do some blow.

We sold the car and disappeared

For three days.

Do you remember that?

And so began our white trash

Melot.

For one brief shining moment.

In 1985, roseanneent on johnny

Carson, which was every comic's

Dream.

She killed, he laughed his ass

Off, game her a thumb's up and

Invited her to sit on the couch.

She g validation from the king

That can never be taken away

From you.


And I just want to say that

Roseanne, youere my johnny

Carson.

And thank you for the thumbs up.

Thank you forllowing me to sit

On your couch for a little bit.

Good night.


Thank you.

I appreciate it.

Thank you.

And you know...

yeah.

Onward we go right?

I know.

Good look.

A[applause]

Our next roaster is gilbert

Gottfried.

Now, gilbert is famous not so

Much for his comedy but for

Pissing off more asian people

Than hiroshima.

Ease welcome that scary kid,

Gilbert gottfried.


Jane lynch!

Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you

Can hear the sound of my voice.

This microphone is covered by

The thick layer of pubic hairs

That shot from between jane's

Teeth.


During the commercial brea,

The produers wipe away the pelt

Of saliva-coated pubes that

Accumulate upon the mic.

And each time jane returns to

The stage, she once again sprays

A carpetf short, pearly hairs

All over the microphone and the

Front row of the nauseated

Dience members.

So forgive me if my voice is,

Shall we say, muffled.


Carrie fisher!

Thank you for visiting us from

The past.


Comedy central looked at

This dais they said we just

Don't have enough washed up,

Repuant, drug-addicted

Menopausal has-beens.

Get me carrie fisher!

[laughte

Because if there's anything

We're certain of it's that

Carrie fisher is available.


D2 has gotten more work from

Star wars than carrie fisher.

But tonight isn't about carrie

Fisher or jeffs or any of

The other diseased-ridden

Transients that were forced from

Their shanties and refrigerator

Box dwellings to be here.


Tonight we honor a monster in

The entertainment industries.

And like most monsters, she goes

By one name, and that name is

Rozilla.

[cheers & applause]

Rozilla!

She's been descrid aseing

Covered with a thick layer of

Scaly gray skin.

Emitting a strong disgusting

Odor of taco grease and ass

Cheese.


Her sharp yellow teeth can take

A man's arm off in one bite if

You are foolish enough to try

And feed the beast her mountain

Of pork crackling and one

Slimfast candy bar.

Rozilla!

Stomping through hollywood for

Decades, breathing fire from her

Hairy snout, burning bridge

After bridge, her glowing red

Eyes striking terror in the

Art of anyone unfortunate

Enough to look in her hideous

Face.


Gnarled cow-like hooves...


Crushing and destroying

Everything in her path.

Stopping only to feed every ten

Minutes and make one sitcom

Decades ago.

Her rolls of fat swaying and

Crashing like a japanese

Moonami.


Let me just stop for a second

And go on the record about

Moonami.


One should never spoke about

Moonami.

One should never joke about

Moonamis.

And most important of all, one

Should never tweet aut

Moonamis.


But if one were to tweet about a

Moonami, he's probably learned

His lesson by now and should get

His endorsement deal back.

[cheers & applause]

So he won't have to keep doing

These horrible [bleep] roasts.

Rozilla!

Or as she's known in tokyo,

Rozilla!


Tonight it's our chance to end

The reign of rozilla forever.

And don't forget about the tail.

Powerful enough to sweep an

Entire ox into her throbbing

Colon.

People always forget about the

Tail.

They say, let's get rozilla.

I say but what about the tail?

Ey never remember the tail.


Those people have paid the

Ultimate price.

And if all else fails, remember

Good people, blame it on the

Jews.


And now for dumb jokes.

A drunken farmer stumbles

Upstairs into his bedroom.

Waking his wife, roseanne.

She sees her husband holding a

Sheep under his arm.

The farmer yells, "this ishe

Big I've been [bleep]."

Roseanne says, you idiot.

These not a pig.

It's a sheep.

The farmer yells, shut the


I was talking to the sheep.


[cheers & applause]

Thank you.

Good night!

[cheers & applause]

He must have a small dick

Because he has to act like that.

Coming up, reanne goes off.

Roseanne, 2012!

The comedy central roast of

Roseanne is brought to you by

Klondike and taco bell.

And now, it's finally time to

Unleash our guest of honor.

[cheers & applause]

An icon, a superstar, a woman

Whose balls are as big as her

Mouth.

Roseanne chased the face of

Television and then changed her

Face.

She's told so many people to

Kiss her ass, it could take

Until the next decades to get it

Done.

And now tell everybody to go


Ladies and gentlemen, roseanne!

[cheers & applause]

Hey, thank you.

Thank you.

Thank a lot.

Greetings roseanne-archists.

[cheers & applause]

I just want to say to all of my

Peers, when comedy central calls

You and tells you they want to

Honor you, and they will, just

Hang the [bleep] up.

I got a dais half full of


I've seen people in front of

Home depot less desperate for

Work.


All I know is I better get my

God damn parking validated or

Some ass hole is getting fired!


Where the hell are the stars?

Christ, I must have pissed off

Everybody I've ever known.

I had a number 1 network show!

I was in a movie with meryl

Streep.

And I get amy [bleep] schumer?


Meryl streep won three oscars.

This bitch came in fourth on

"last comic standing."


Thank you for your votes.

But I guess you people are

The only ones that can take the

Roseanne retort.

Since I am the meanest, baddest

Bitch on earth.

[cheers & applause]

Thank you.


And that is the reason why I'm

Running for president of ese

God damn United States of

America!

[cheers & applause]

That's right.

Put that in your [bleep] pipe

And smoke it, you honky [bleep].

Obama will get my weed when he

Pries it out of my cold dead

Fingers.

[cheers & applause]

Thank got for jane lynch.

You are one ferocous bitch.

I love you so much.

The most revolutionary character

On television.

But I hate you because you are

Thin.

But I guess I'd be thin too if

All I ever ate was [bleep].


But I love this about you.

I really do.

Ellen barkin, wow!

I thought you were dead!


Sweet!

So glad to see you.

But I said I wanted that butchy

Blond named ellen, I meant

Degeneres.

Carrie fisher, the literary

Voice of a generation.

I'm your biggest fan.

What a career you've had.

Actress, writer, drug mule.


Seth green, I don't want to

Overlook you, which is easy for

Anyone over 5 feet tall.

Jan lynch has vibrators bigger

Than you, seth.

She can use it.

The only difference is, they

Can give a woman an orgasm.


Wayne brady, you have

Single-handedly redefined improv

By scripting it.


You can do anything with an

Audience suggestion.

Here's one for you.

Get the [bleep] off the stage.


Y schumer, thanks for

Reinforcing the stereotype that

Women ain't funny.

Actually, I just loved your

Set.

I think you're [bleep]great.

I loved it.

Amy schumer.


An tony jeselnik.

You know the different between

Anthony and a gay porn actor,

Judging but your looks and how

Much you sucked tonight, none.


Jeff ross.

Jeff ross is the third-rate

Comedians to what kim kardshian

Is to no-talent fame whores.

Hero!


Gilbert gottfried.

You know, the difrence between

Gilbert's voice and a sandpaper

Dildo?

Do you?


After 20 minutes, you might

Start enjoying the dildo.


And hence the difference.

And last but not least, tom

Arnold.

I'd really like to thank tom for

Showing uptonight.

It was very brave.

And he was very funny.

But jesus christ, ow much


For that guy?

This night has been one of the

Greatest nights of my life.

That's not saying shit for my

Life.


No but it was a blast, you

Guys.

Thanks to the audience, too.

Laughing.

There's nothing better than a

Good laugh.

Nothing on earth.

And here is the teachabl moment

Tonight.

If I can bury my royaling

Boiling creaseless hatred for

The likes of tomarnold, maybe

There's a chance that we can

Have world peace, ladies and

Gentlemen.

[cheers & applause]

But the truth is, I would gladly

Give up even that dream if I

Could just sing.

[cheers & applause]

ï½¶ o'er the land of the free ï½¶

[cheers & applause]

ï½¶ and the home of the brave ï½¶
