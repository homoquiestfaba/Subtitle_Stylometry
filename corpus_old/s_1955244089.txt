There was no one

Any trouble?
Nah, they didn't give a shit.

Can I have a beer?

They didn't give a shit.
Now you're gonna talk to el Capi.

Sounds good.

But I'm gonna need
a bigger truck.

To move bigger
shipments, no?

You only bring
what's yours.

Right. Thanks.

Any trouble you let us know.

Got it.
Yes.

Ready.

Great, thanks.
Take care.

Put it there.

Pop those panels.

Can you or can't you?

Fuck you. You take a shower.
You smell like feet.

Don't do that again, asshole.
I can fuck you up.

Watch out, asshole!

Don't be sloppy, man.
Put up those seats.

Are the hinges working?
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir...

There's still room.

Thank you.
How's your mom?

Good, good. Feeling better.
She sends her best.

Thanks.

Excuse me.

The State finals.

Fuck.

Hello?

What's up Bacacho?

Yes, I just wanted
to talk to my uncle.

To ask him a favor.

Yeah.

So I'll wait for your call.

Got it, great. Bye.

What's up, Cota?

I know... But I need
to talk before you leave...

Hey, can I ask you a favor?

You still have the workshop?

You think I can
crash there?

Just to wait there until
I go see my uncle...

In thirty minutes...

Cool... thanks.

Thanks, bro. Bye.

Shut the fuck up.

Keep him quiet. Manque
is upstairs with the baby.

Ok.

Here you go, dude.

Don't lose the keys.

Don't worry.

Help me

Don't be a fag.
If you dragged him here...

Do it yourself.

Come on, help me.

Give them to me...

Aim at him.

Let's see your hands.

Easy there.

There you go, Arni.

Thanks, man.

Manque made hotcakes.
If you're hungry.

Yeah, thanks man.

Let me see...

Hi uncle...
All good... All good...

Just wanted to say hi...

To tell you about
an opportunity...

Ok... We'll talk later.

What's up, Arnulfo?

Just passing by to say hello.

You still owe Capi some stuff, no?

Almost nothing.
It's all stored up.

So why'd you come here?

Just wanted to see my uncle.

To ask a favor.

And why don't you ask me?

Because it's...

It's a family thing.

I won't take long.

Someone's looking for you, Martin.

Hello, uncle.

What's up, Arnulfo?

I just wanted to talk for a moment.

You should be doing your thing, no?

Yeah, right?

What?

Something wrong?

So...?

I've got something
that'll interest you.

What?

Come over here.

Where were you
before coming here?

I came straight here.

Does your mother
know about this?

No.

You see anyone else?
No.

What the fuck
are you thinking?

Why the fuck did
you bring him here?

He's got information.
I thought it could help you.

You think we're all
fucking stupid?

We're stupid, right?
And what about you?

What about you and
your faggot shit?

He's with the ATF.

He knows all the names,
the routes, the shipments...

Let's see what
your gringo knows.

Bring him.

Here he is.

You know who I am?

No?

You sure?

Didn't you know a lot?

My nephew says
you know a lot.

But you don't know anything.

Are you a cop?

Arnulfo...

You're coming with
me to La Primavera.

No, uncle.

Come on, move.

Give me the
handcuff keys.

Let's do this fast.

He's got information
that can help you.

Fuck, come on!

Come on...

...you have to take him after.

Grab it, goddamit.

Go.

What the fuck you mean, no?

He can help. Gimme a
chance to take him.

There's no
chance of shit.

Go.

What?

You gonna cry?

You gonna cry, asshole?

Ok...

...ok then.

You're a faggot.

I can't find the goddamn phone.

Hi, mom.

What are you doing
here, Arnulfo?

We just had some trouble.

I just need to make a phone call.
They called me, Arnulfo.

They already called me.

Everything's fine.

My friend will help us.

What friend?

What the hell are
you thinking, Arnulfo?

I don't want to hear him.

Let me make a call,
they'll come for us.

You can't be here.

I can't have you
here when they come.

Mom...

I'm talking to you...

Mom!

So where should I go?

I didn't want to leave
Colima but I came, right?

I don't know,
but you fucked us.

Here. Take this.

Do what you have to do,
but you can't stay here.

Fuck you, bitch!

Hello, godfather...

Yeah, all's good.

Listen, can I come over?

My mom's in Pericos...

Yes, in about an hour.

Your godmother went
to Marisela's house.

She took dinner to the girls.

Sit.

Yes, thanks.
You ok?

Yes, all's fine.

You sure?

They wanted to screw
us near GÃ³mez FarÃ­as.

Some assholes,
so we came down here.

We're waiting for some
guys to go to Nogales.

Why were you
by GÃ³mez FarÃ­as?

We were detoured there,
but I came from PeÅ„itas.

But everything's all right.

Until it's not.

And then?

Let me get you
something to eat.

No need, it's fine.
Hold on.

Eat this.

Thanks.

So?

You're going where?

Nogales?

Yes, we've got a
job over there.

And then?

I'm taking
off for a while.

And this guy?

He's my partner.

He's working
with my uncle.

Hello?

Hello?

Let me call
your godmother.

See what time
she's back.

What's up, honey?

How are the girls?

They eat dinner?

You're kidding?

Listen... Arnulfo is here.

No, no, he's
almost leaving...

Hold on.

No, wait... wait.

Go get the other one.

You motherfucker.
What did you think?

You would just
leave like that?

Not here, Capi.

Go get Roca.
