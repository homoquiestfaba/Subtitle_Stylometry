We Have An 18-Year-Old Male

With Gunshot Wounds
To The Leg And Shoulder.

One, Two, Three.

Yep. He's On Something.

Jason.
I Need To Talk To Jason.

Soon. Just Not Now.

Get Her Into Pre-Op.

How Did You Get In?

I...I Heard The Gunshots,

And I Rushed To The Back Door.

What'd You Do To Jason?

Huh?

Can I See A Doctor?

Baby, The Police Are Outside.

And If You're Up To It,
They Want To Talk To You.

I'll Take Care Of Ashley,
Mr. Lane.

Thank You, Brother.

So...

How Did You End Up

At Your Brother's Girlfriend's
House Last Night?

We Were Working On...

Christmas Costumes
For My Play.

Where'd You Get The Money
We Found In Your Possession?

We Were Raising That Money

At The Garage Sale Yesterday.

See, This Past Fall,
Things Had Gotten Pretty Bad...

At School,

At Home.

Man: This Year's Production,

<I>Holiday Cheer,
Has Been Penned</I>

By Yours Truly.

All Right,
So When I Call Your Name,

Just Come Up To The Stage
And State The Part

You'll Be Reading.

Uh, Monica Tishauer.

I'll Be Reading For Betty,

The Garbage Girl.

Just Look At What
I Found In My Garbage Truck.

I'll Have The Best-Decorated

House In Town.

This Is Garbage.

Man: Ashley Lane?

Ashley Lane?

People,
Time Is Of The Essence.

Last Call For Ashley Lane.

Right.

Karen Snow?

Idiot.

How Will You Know

If You Will Ever Do Anything

If You Can
Never Do Anything?

How'd It Go?

It Went.

I Decided That
I Didn't Have Time. So...

Should At Least Try.

Yeah? You Didn't.

It's Gonna Be Stupid Anyway.

Oh, But Ms. Lane,

You'd Be Missing Out
On Such A Wonderful

High School Experience.

Nicki, Drop Dead.

Forgot To Pick Up Jason.
Ah.

He's Been Waiting
A Half An Hour.

Well, He's 17.
He'll Get Over It.

Would It Bother You So Much
If It Was Ashley I Forgot?

Forget About It.
I'm Going.

I'm Going.

Thank You, Bill.

How About Let's Just Have An
Early Dinner Tonight, Huh, Baby?

Uh, Tonight's No Good.

I Already Made Plans
With Phyllis And Claire.

Maybe Next Time.

Okey-Dokey.

I Know...

Drive You Home?

No, It's Okay, Mr. Lane.
I Gotta Meet Someone.

But, Uh, Catch Y'all Later.

Fasten Your Seatbelt.

It Wasn't Me.
It Was Nicki.
Mm-Hmm.

I Think Your Mother--

You Mean Your Wife?

You've Got To Stop
Hanging Out With Nicole.

When We Get Home,

I Want You
To Put Those Clothes
In The Laundry.

They Smell Like Smoke.

I Saw That.

Geez!

Who Reeks In Here?

This Must Be You,
Ashtray Lane, Right?

So Jason, How Was Practice?

Brutal.

Captain Hit The Hurdle
Full-On.

He's Probably
Out For The Season.

But Hopefully I Get My Shot
At Being Captain Now.

Really?

It Could Happen.
Right?

I Mean, Who Else
Would Coach Pick, Anyway?

Someone With Better Grades.

Where's Mom?

At Some Committee Thing.

Right.

Yo. Think Fast, Brainless.

Hey, Where You Going?

Uh...

Just Gonna Go Meet Up
And Study With Angel Tonight.

Look, Uh...

If I Don't Get Off Probation
This Semester,

Then I Can't Run Track.

And We Both Know
How Disappointed That
Would Make Mom, Right?

Yeah. Sorry.

Where're Your Books?

I'm Gonna
Go Get Some Chicken.

Anybody...

Wanna Come?

Nicki, Big Surprise...

Sharon Is Out.


And All I Have To Do
Is Homework And Laundry.

Dad's Picking Up Dinner.

So You're Alone?

Cain's Club Time.

Uh, I Don't--

He's Gonna Be Back.

So?

Just Leave Him A Note.

Okay, Meet Me In 15.

Hey, There.

Hey.

What's Your Name?

They All Go Off
And Leave You?

Willy, Huh?

Thank You Very Much.

We Just Met.

Wanna Come Out And Play?

Huh?

Come On.

Billy.

Come On.

You...

You Really Stink.

We Have To Work On That.

Nice.

I've Got To Go.

But I'll Be Back.

See You Later.

So This Beats
Doing Laundry, Huh?

I Mean, Just A Little?

I Can't Find My Cigarettes.

You And Your Dad
Not So Disney These Days.

Sharon And Me...

Like A Total Train Wreck.

You Got A Light?

Man:
Have We Met Before?

Trust Me...
If We Had, You'd Remember.

Dance?

Boy: Hey, Jason!

First-Timers.

Hey. Keep It Down.

I Got Money.

Um...

I Was Just Going
Down To Angel's.

You Could Drop Me Off There.

I Am...

Superman.

I Can Do Anything.

Man, You--
You Blew Me Away

At Practice Today.

You Think Maybe, Uh...

You Could Teach Me
To Do Distance?

I'm Not
A Miracle Worker, Baby.

Just Superman.

Go Ahead, Jazz.

I'll Advance You...

Again.

Hey, Hey, Hey.


That's--That's Mine.

Rich Boy's Good For It.

Nobody Gets Deep Into Me.

I Still Owe You?

You Jocks Aren't Very Good
With Numbers, Are You?

$120.

What?! I-I Just
Gave You A Hundred.

You Haven't Give Me Jack.

Your Parties Are Never
Gonna Be On Me.

I'll Get It To You, G.

Tomorrow, Jazz.

And Forget About Angel.

She Doesn't Own You.

Hello?

Wait A Minute.

This Isn't--

This Isn't The Washroom.

Hello?

You Know, This Isn't Exactly
The Best Neighborhood
To Be Passing Out In.

Where's Your Date?

I'm Not Allowed To Date.

I Am A Princess.


Shh.

Shh.

Oh...

All Right,
Let's Get You Home.

What...Great...Hair.

Whoo.

Yay.

Well, Princess,
Where Do You Live?

At Home.

Would You Like To Kiss Me?

Definitely Not.


Why Not?

Am I Ugly?


No.

Your Breath Stinks.

I Like You, Too.

Look, I've Got To Be At Work
Early Tomorrow,

And If You Want A Ride Home,
Just Tell Me Where You Live.

Otherwise, Out Of The Van.

5...3...3...

Parkwood Drive.

You Know...

You're Not Very Nice.

<I>I Am Not</I>

Going To Dance With You.

Hey, Baby.

Sharon: Hey.

How Was Dinner?

Didn't Go Too Well.

I Missed You.

Did You Have A Good Time?

We Were Trying To Motivate
The Denby Company

To Conform
To Green Standards.
Mm-Hmm.

I Have Been Working,

And I Am Tired.

I'm Green.

Did You Feed That Dog?

Ah...

I Told Jason To Do It.

The Dog Is Not Jason's
Little Brother.

And It's Not Gonna Make Up
For The Fact

That We Don't
Have A Child Together.

Wow.

What Are You Doing?

Bill: I Thought You Were
In Your Room Not Feeling Well.

I Am Not.

Sharon:
Where Have You Been?

And What Are You Wearing?!

That's Too Many Questions.

I Only Do One
At A Time, Okay?

It Is Not Okay.

Are You Drunk?

You Been Drinking?

Oh, Give It
A Rest, Sharon.

I Seem To Remember You
Getting Hammered

A Time Or Two
When You Were Younger.

Bill: Come Here, Baby.

Okay, Daddy.

Put Your Hand Around Daddy.

Oh...
Real Neat.

I Love You.
I Know.

Can I Have Some
Cookies And Milk?

You Know You're
Better Than This.

I Wish I Had A Real Mom.

You Remind Me So Much
Of Amanda.

My Little Princess.

Sharon Hates Me.

Oh, No She Doesn't.

She Does Not Hate You.

She Just Gets Disappointed

When You Do Things
Like Tonight.

I'm Disappointed, Too.

But I Still Love You.

Good Night, Princess.

Why Do You
Disappoint Sharon, Daddy?

Whoa.

Who Beat You Up Last Night?



You Look Like Trash.

No Response?

Okay. Cool.


Oh, Yeah. Here You Go.

Want Some Breakfast?

You Can Have As Much
As You Want.

I Made Enough For Everybody.


What?

Okay.

More For Me.

I Actually Feel Better.

I Bet You Do.

Just Wanna Die Now.

Well, Here's A Little
Trick I Learned.

Peppermint Schnapps.

Drink Some Of This.

You'll Feel Better.
Come On.

Ooh. Oh, That's Good.

I Owe You.

Ah, Actually,

Funny That You Say That.

I, Uh...

Could Use Some Money
Right Now.

Hmm.
Hmm.

You And Everybody Else.

Y--What?

What Am I Supposed
To Do With $5?

I Can't--
Sharon: Good Morning.

Jay,

Haven't Seen You
In A While.

<I>What's Been
Keeping You Busy?</I>

That Was Your Fault
Last Night, Mom.

What Are You Talking About?

While You Were At Your
Meeting Thing,

I Was Hittin' The Books.

All Right, Um,

I Happen To Be Free Tonight

If You Wanna Go Grab Dinner
Or Something,

Just The Two Of Us.
You're On.

I'll Pick You Up
After Practice.
All Right.

Bye, Baby.

Feel Better.

Sharon.

About Last Night...

I'm Sorry.

I Guess I Just...

Makin' A Play
For Your Father's Attention?

Again?

I'm Just Trying To--

Well I'm Trying
To Keep Peace

For Your Father's Sake.

Can't You At Least Do That?

Keep Peace?
Mm-Hmm.

Yeah.

Yeah, I Can--
I Can Do That.

Good.


"Good Morning, Dad."

Hello, Kids.

"I'll Make You
Coffee, Dad."

Thank You, Honey.

"I'll Do The Dishes, Dad."

Thank You, Jason.

Make It Strong, Bill.

Make It Strong.

What Is That?

Here You Go.
Thank You, Baby.

You're Welcome.

Sharon?
Yeah.

Could We Agree
To Cut Down On Some Things?

I'm Not Spending
Anything Extra.

No, But Your Lunches
And Your Dinners
With Your Friends

Really Add Up.

Maybe If You Did Something
With A Future.?

Lane Publishing
Was Daddy's Baby.

But Not Ours.

Your Lobbying Job
Pays Practically Nothing.

Well, At Least I'm
Contributing To Society.

I'd Like You To Contribute
More To Our Finances.

This House Is Worth
Less Than Half

Of What We Paid For It.

Were Are Serious
Underwater, Baby.

You're Not Thinking
Of Selling It, Are You?

We Can't.

We Don't Have Enough Equity
To Pay Off The Mortgage.

I'll Get It.

I Was On My Way Out,
Anyway.

Have A Nice Day.

Hi, There.
I Noticed You Might

Need Some Maintenance
Work Done.

Bill!

Hi.

Uh, What Can I Do For You?

I Hope I Can Help You.

I Just Finished Several Jobs
For You Neighbors.

Uh, The Alexanders,
Proudfoots,

And Mr. Wilson.

They Can All Tell You
About My Work.
Mmm.

Thanks, But I Really--

If I May. Uh...

Some Areas--

Need Serious Repair.

I Know. Believe Me.

Uh, Look, Thanks,
But I Can't--

I Can't Really "Afford"
Any...

Extra Help Right Now.

I'm A Good Worker
And I'm Open To Barter.

Uh...What Do You
Have In Trade?

Nicki,

How Did I Get Home
Last Night?

<I>Nicki:
I Don't Know, But...</I>

<I>I Got Home
In A '65 Mustang.</I>

<I>Are You Home Now?</I>

And Hung Over.

<I>( Chuckling )
You Lush.</I>

<I>Meet Me
At "Hooker On A Stump."
Okay.</I>

Whoa.

Nice Shoes.

School Let Out
Early Today?

And You Are?

Mac.

Dad Hired Me
To Work On The House.

Brilliant.

I'm Just On My Way

To Audition
For A Christmas Play.

When You See My Dad,
Will You Tell Him That?

And That I'll
Be A Little Late.

Okay?

Ashley: Hey.
Oh.

Hey.

Do You Wanna Go
To A House Party Tonight?

Sharon's Too Burned.

I Have To Be Back Home

Before She And Jason
Get Back From Dinner.

Just Come For A Little While.

But You're, Uh,

Gonna Have To Wear Something

<I>A Little Better Than That.</I>

No Money.

You Know--Come Here.

You Don't Have To Always
Pay For Everything.

Nicki,

You Shoplift?

Where Do You Think
I Get All My Stuff?

Hello, Angelina.

Hi, Mr. L.

Um, I Made This Shirt
For Jason.

I Hand-Embroidered It.

You Don't Think It's
Too Feminine, Do You?

No. It Reminds Me
Of What I Used To Wear.

Jason's Having Dinner
With His Mother.

Really?
Yeah.

You Don't Have To Lie
If He's With Another Girl.

Oh. Come In.

So,

What Makes You Think

He Wouldn't Be Having Dinner
With His Mother?

I Never See Him Anymore.

Saw Him Last Night.

Or Doesn't Studying
Count Anymore?

No, I Haven't Seen Jason
In Two Weeks.

New Friends
Are Such Scumbags.

What New Friends
You Talking About?

Did Jason Make This?

Yes, He Did.

That Was His Christmas Present
To Me Last Year.

He Made Me A Beautiful
Jewelry Box.

You Know We Plan To Have
Our Own Business Someday?

Me Doing The Whole
Clothes-Design Thing,

And Jason Doing His Woodwork.


Nice.

So Maybe He's Been
Spending More Time At The Shop.

Nice Try.

But They Haven't Seen Him
In Over A Month.

He Even Left A Rocker
He Was Working On Half-Finished.

I Don't Know What
To Tell You, Baby.

Well, Just Give Him This.

I'll Have A Talk With Him.

No. I'm The One That Needs
To Have A Talk With Im.

You're Really Okay, Mr. L.

Thank You.

Sometimes I Wonder.

Okay, Well,
I'm Gonna Go.

Have A Good Day, Baby.
Thanks.

So, What's Been
Keeping My Track Star

Away From Home So Much?

It's Not A Girl, Is It?

No, Uh-Uh.

As A Matter Of Fact,

I Stood Up Angel Last Night
So I Could Study.

You're Still Seeing Her?

Does Her Mother
Still Work At Wal-Mart?

Whoa! Mom, For Real?

Come On--Her Mom's Cool,
All Right?

I Mean, Besides, I Might Need
To Get A Job There, Myself.

You Get An Allowance.

Yeah, But Dad's Cutting Back
Till I Get My Grades Up.

<I>I Need Money Now.</I>

For What?

Something Wrong?

Nuh-Uh.

My Cross-Trainers
Just Gettin' Old.

I Forgot.

At Your Age, Things Get Old
Five Minutes Ago, Right? Mmm?

How Much You Need, Baby?

350.

For Cross-Trainers?

Well, I Mean,

The Whole Team's Gettin'
These Leather Jackets, Right?

I Guess I Could
Settle For A Nylon Jacket,

But I Know You Don't
Want Your Boy Rocking
No Nylon Jacket At School.

I Only Got 150, Jay.

No, That's Cool.
That's Cool.

That's Enough For The Shoes.

But We Can Go Shopping Together
For That Jacket, Right?

I Mean, You--
You Can Charge It, Right?

Right.

You're The Best, Mom.

I Love You, Too, Baby.

<I>So, Baby, I Know I Haven't
Been To The Track Meets Lately,</I>

And I'm Sorry, But You
Know I've Been Working Hard
With This Committee.

You Know? Go Green.
Yeah.

But I Really Wanna
Talk To You About That Angel.

What?
I Don't Like Her.

Huh?

I Just Don't.

I-I Just Feel Like She's...
In The Way Of Your Future.

She's Needy.
She Didn't Even
Do Anything To You.

She's Needy. Just Saying.

Okay, Okay.
You Need To Try Something New.

New Like What?
What's New?

Keep It Movin'.Com.

What Is That?
Did You Just Make That Up?

Well, Maybe.

Okay.
Might Be A Site With Some
New Booty On It.

Mom!

Ahh.

The Jacket
Looks Nice On You.
Right?

Thank You.
Thank You To My Mom.


Why Are You
Sitting In The Dark?

Where Were You Last Night?

Uh...I-I Was Studying

Like I Told You.

You Haven Seen Angelina
In Weeks.

I Just Figured That
Studying With Angel Would...

Um, Just Distract Me
A Little Bit.

He Already Told Me.

Just Where Have You
Been Going?

Bill...
I Asked You A Question.

The Library. What--A Guy
Tries To Do The Right Thing,

And I Get Jumped For It?

Are You Trying
To Do The Right Thing?

Yes--


Your Father's Finished
With His Questions.

Go On Upstairs
And Study, Baby.

Well,

You've Managed To Ruin
A Perfectly Lovely Evening.

<I>Bill: Just Trying
To Make Him Live Up
To His Responsibilities.</I>

<I>He Only Comes Home
Long Enough To Eat</I>

And To Ask For More Money.

Sharon: Like Your Daughter's
Home More?

My Son's An Athlete,

And One Day He's
Going To Be Important.

He's Important Now, Sharon.

Has It Ever Occurred To You
That Jason

Doesn't Even
Wanna Be An Athlete?

Then Why Is He Trying So Hard
To Make Captain?

He's Not.
If You'd Come To Any

Of His Track Meets,
You'd Know.

He--He'll Never Be Captain.

Your Daughter's The Loser.

And She Dresses
Like Trailer Trash.

<I>Bill: If Ashley's Mother
Was Home Once In A While--</I>

Oh, Please.
I'm Up In This Dump
More Than I Care To Be.

Charming.

If A--
Maybe,

<I>Maybe If We
Got This Place Together...</I>

Let's Get You Back.

No Life, Huh?

This Is Gross.

It May Not Look Like
Much Now, But, Uh,

Wait Till I
Get The Drapes Up.

This Place Is A Hole.

It Just...
Needs A Little Love.

Yeah.

Well, Don't We All?

Why Don't You Put This On?

It's...

Warmer.

And Why Don't You
Take Care Of Willy?

Bill: What, Did You Guys
Buy Out The Entire Store?

Sneaking In Again?

I Just Fed Willy.

Thank You, Baby.

What Was She Wearing?

( Chuckles )
Looked Like It
Was From A Thrift Store.

Jason,
I Need To Talk To You!

Are You Sure You Wouldn't
Rather Talk To My Father?

<I>I Came To See You.
You Weren't Home.</I>

Why'd You Tell Him We Haven't
Been Studying Together?

I Didn't Know You
Told Him We Were.
Look, I---

I Just Can't Have Any More
Hassles Right Now.

Don't Shut Me Out.

Mmm.

Let's Go Somewhere.

Is Your Mom Home?

She Leaves For Work
In About An Hour.

I Don't Think
I Can Wait That Long.

Promise Me You'll Come Over
This Time.

I Love You.

Promise.

Believe It.

That Is One Hot
Little Piece Of Ass.

You Shut Up About Her.
You Hear Me?

That's Not How You
Talk To Me.

Thanks.

You, Too, Willy.

You're Welcome.

You'll Make A Terrific
Virgin Mary.

Shut Up.

Who Said I Was A Virgin?

I Was Talking About The Play.

And Being A Virgin Is Bad
Because...Why?

'Cause Nobody Else Is.

There May Be One Or Two.

And What Play Are You
Talking About?

Hello? The Christmas Play.

Mary, Baby Jesus,

Wise Men.

You Auditioned For It.

Remember?

No One Does That Kind
Of Play Anymore.

It's Not Politically Correct.


Oh.

I Ran Across This
When I Was Cleaning.

Wait.

Sharon Was In The Band
With My Mom And Dad?

Evidently. She Was Pregnant
And Depressed.

Her Boyfriend Left Her.

She Didn't Want The Baby.

The Plan Was For Your Mother
To Watch After Both Kids

While Sharon Filled In
With The Band.

How Do You Know All This?

Your Father Asked Me
To Look Over Things

So I Wouldn't Throw Out
Anything Important.

This Seemed Important.

And...Kinda Personal.

So I Stopped Reading.

Thanks.

Would You Be Willing
To Do Me A Favor?

That Depends.

There's A Bunch Of Kids
Down At The Shelter

Who Don't Know It's
Not Politically Correct
To Have A Christmas Play.

They'd Really
Like To Have One,

And I Could Really
Use A Good Acting Coach.

I Can't Act.

Huh.

I--

What Makes You
Think That's Mine?

You See?

You Can Give
Quite A Performance.

So, I Have No Choice.

No.

But I Think You'll Like It.

It's Three Days A Week,
And A Half-Day Saturdays.

Come Back To Bed
And Hold Me.

You Could At Least
Help Me With The Bed.

You Helped Mess It Up.

Don't Be Mad, Angel.

Do You Still
Love Me, Jason?

You're The Only Girl I Dated
Since The 7th Grade.

You Never Say It.

Uh--

You've Been My Lady

Since I First Saw You
At The Halloween Party

Rolling Around On The Floor
In That Stupid Pumpkin Costume.

I'm Pregnant.

You're Kidding, Right?

No.

I Did The Test.

Three Times.

What Are You Going To Do?

We Could Get Married In Kentucky
On Account Of I'm Pregnant.

Kentucky?
Are You Out Of Your Gourd?

We Can't Keep It.

What Do You Mean?

Give Me A Break.

What Do You Want Me To Do?

What We Always Talked About.

You Should've
Been More Careful.

"Careful" Works Both Ways.

What--What
About All Your Talk

About Us Being Together
Forever?

I Didn't Mean
Like This Week!

And Besides,
We Have No Money.

You Can Make Good Money
As A Carpenter.

You're Great At It.

Angel, Baby...

This...Just Isn't A Good Time

To Get Married.

You Can See That,
Can't You?

All Right,

I'll Get The Money
For The Abortion.

Geez, All Anybody Ever
Wants Out Of Me Is Money.

That Is Not True!

I Love You, Jason.

This Is Our Child.
How Can You Even
Think Of Destroying It?

Well, You Better
Think Of It.

'Cause I'm Not
Gonna Be Trapped By You

Or Anyone Else.

Don't Say A Word About This
To Anyone.

Jason!

Now, Not Everybody
Will Have A Speaking Part.

But Everyone Will
Have A Very Important Role.

You All Have Special Talents.

Kevin Doesn't.
He's Lame.

Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

Kids, I'd Like You All
To Meet Ms. Lane.

Children: Hi, Ms. Lane.

Are You Lois Lane,
Superman's Wife?

No, Duck-Brain.
Superman's Wife Is Old.

All Right. Kids,
I'll Be Right Back.

Everyone Just
Behave Yourselves.

You're Not Scared Of A Few
Second-Graders?

No.

It's The Sixth-Graders
That I'm Worried About.

Look, If You're
Having Second Thoughts,

This Is The Time To Decide.

Uh--You're The One
Who Asked Me To Do This.

And I Think You'll
Be Great At It.

But That Doesn't Mean

You Can Quit If You Go Down
And Change Your Mind Later.

Give Me Your Word.

Yeah. You Have My Word.

Good.

The Second Chapter Of Luke

Is The Theme For The Script
We're Gonna Need.

Wait, You Want Me
To Help Write The Script?

No.

I Want You To Write It.

Oh, And By The Way,
We Need 17 Speaking Parts.

Seventeen?

Everyone That Wants
To Work On Scenery,

Come This Way.

Go, Jason!
Whoo!

Oh, No.

Oh, Buddy.

I Warned You About That
Superstar Stuff, Lane!

But Coach, If Hank
Had Just Been There For Me
When I Reached Back,

None Of This
Would've Happened.
Bullshit!

You Started Too Soon.

And When Hank Was Closing In
On You, You Sped Up,

Crossed Lanes,

Disqualified The Whole Team.

This Sport
Isn't All About You.

Get It

I Can Change, Coach.

I Can.

Show Me.

That Was Too Close For Me.

I Don't Know Why You
Made Such A Big Deal Out Of It.

Just Sunglasses.

We Were Stealing.

That's Not Okay.

There's Gotta Be A Better Way
To Enjoy Life.

Oh, There Is.

He's Comin' Right This Way.

Hi, I'm Ken.

And You Are?

Barbie.

I'm Barbie.

You Like To Dance?

Only If You Buy Me
A Pink House.

Some Friends
Are Having A Party Later.

Wanna Come?

Cheers, Darling.

Tell Nicole I Had To Leave.

Nicole? I Thought Her Name
Was Barbie.

Hey, Jay.

You Just Gonna Walk In
And Not Speak?

Hey.

How Was The Meet?

You Were Supposed To Come.

I Know Baby, But...

The Protest Got Started Late.

Somebody Forgot
To Bring Their Permit.

You Know--
Spare Me, Mom.

I'm Sorry.

I'm Gonna Go Hang Out
With Some Of The Guys.

I'm Already Running Late.
So...

Oh, By The Way.

I, Uh--I Need Some Money.

I Just Gave You Some.
What Happened To The Money
That I Gave You?

You Know I'm A Growing Boy.
I Gotta Eat, Right?

Uh, Well,

You Are Eatin' Me
Out Of House And Home.

Here's A 20.

Where's Your Jacket At?

It's Cold Outside.

Uh, I, Uh...

Left It In My Locker
Earlier.


Can I Get A Hug?

Mmm.

Be Careful, Jay.

Um, Sharon?

Yes?
Have You Seen Mac?

We're Supposed To Work
On A Project Together.

No, I Haven't.

But You're Home Early.

You Look Good.
I'm Impressed.

Thanks.

Your Father And I
Are Gonna Go To A Go Green
Benefit Tonight.

You'll Be Okay By Yourself?

Yeah. Have A Good Time.

I Like Those Shoes.

Hmm.

Wow.

Look At This Place.

How's The Play Coming?

Do You Own A Dress Coat?

Yes.

Why Do You Ask?

I Couldn't Find Luke.

There's A Table Of Contents
In The Front Of The Book.

Or You Could Just
Google It.

Don't You Look Handsome?

So Do You, Honey.

I Love That Dress.
Thank You.

Can You Believe That Ashley
And I Had A Conversation Today?

You Did?
Oh, Yeah.

About What?

Well, She's Working On, Uh,

Some New Project,
And I Encouraged Her.

Oh, Baby.
Mm-Hmm.

Thank You.
Ooh Ooh.

Uh--Watch Out, Now.

Actually I Should
Be Thanking You.

For What?

Well, For The Garden,

The Bushes, The New Flowers.

Mm-Hmm.

I Can Actually Park The Car
In The Garage Again.

Who Knew?

You're The Best.
Mwah.

Mm-Hmm.

Oh, Do You Have A 20?

Here You Go.

Bill, You Only Have A 20.

Nah, I've Got A 20
And A 50.

Mmm, No. Look.

Only A 20.
Don't Worry About It.

I-I'll Go To The Bank
Tomorrow, Okay?

Grab An Arm.
Fo' Sho'.

Here We Go.

I Just Need Some Stuff.

And?

I, Uh...

I Brought--
I Brought Money.

What's Wrong?

Huh?

Wait! Please, Please,
I'm Sick.

Please, Please,
Please, Guys.

Please.

I'll Do Whatever You Want!

I'm Begging You, Geo.

Please.

Please!

Then You're
Working With Roach.

Ashley, You Okay?

Where'd You
Go The Other Night?

I Gotta Write A Play.

Did You Just Say,
"Write A Play"?

I Gotta Go.

It's Just Not As Much Fun
Without You.

Then Go Home For A Change.

I'll Talk To You Tomorrow.

Okay.

I've Never
Read That Before.

That's Good.

You'll Write
With A Fresh Perspective.

I Still Don't Know

How I'm Gonna
Get 17 Parts Out Of It.

Put Yourself
In Their Positions.

What Would You Think?

Yeah, But 17 Parts?

When Was The Last Time
You Saw A Bunch Of People

<I>Get Together And Not
Have A Lot To Say?</I>

All The Time At My House.

Bring It Back.

Come Here.

Good Boy.

Good Boy.

Nick. What Happened?

Did Ken Do This?

I Just Went Home

Like You Said.

My Old Man
Was Drunk Again.

I Should've Known Better.

It's Not Your Fault.

You're Safe Now.

Let's Get You
To A Hospital.

No.

Don't Be Afraid.

Let Me Help You.

I'll...Get A First Aid Kit.

Let's Get You Inside.

Trust Me.

Okay, All Right.

All Right.

Why Does He Hate Me?

He Hates Himself.

Why Does He Do This To Me?

He Doesn't Know Love.

That Makes Him Dangerous.

No Shit.

He's A Monster.

How Do I Make Him Stop?

You Can't.

So I Just Let Him
Keep Beating Me?

I Definitely
Don't Recommend That.

Then What?

Do You Want Things
To Change?

That's An Insane Question.

Then You Need To Report This
To The Police.

What He Did Was Criminal.

He'll Kill Me.

Look, I Know You're Scared.

It's A Difficult Decision.

I Understand.

But It's One
You've Got To Make.

He Won't Stop.

Ever Consider Leaving Home?

Only Every Day.

I'm 17.

I Don't Got A Place To Go.

I Don't Want To End Up
Sleeping On The Streets.

You Can Stay With Me.

It's The First Place
He'd Look.

This Is The Number
For A Friend Of Mine.

Her Father Had A Lot
In Common With Yours.

She Can Give You
A Place To Stay

Right Now, If You Want It.

Yeah, Okay.

Okay.

Good.

And If You're Up
For Riding A Bike,
I'll Take You There Tonight.

Sorry.

It's Gonna Burn A Little.

Thank God You're Home.

Where Else Would I Be?

It's Me, Nick.

Where Are You?

I've Left Tons
Of Messages And Texts.

Call Me.

Why Won't You Just Tell Me
Where You Took Nicki?

I Promise I Won't
Tell Anybody.

I Gave Her My Word.

She's Okay.

She'll Be In Touch
When She's Ready.

Okay, Guys.
Um, There Are 17 Parts

And We Need Some Singers.

So, Who Can Sing?

Oh, Mr. Blackman?

I'm Working On A Play
Down At The Shelter,

And We Need To Find Costumes
And Props--

Young Lady, Our Department
Is Grossly Underfunded

And Understaffed.

We Need Those Things
Ourselves.

I Wasn't Asking For Things.

Just Advice.

Well, I'm Sorry
I Can't Help You.

Mr. Evans,

You've Been Told Before

We Cannot Have That
Horrible Smell In Here.

They're Sanding
Down In The Shop.

And If You Don't Want Your
Backdrop Covered In Sawdust,
I Can't Do It There.

Yeah, Well, You Can't
Do It Here, Either.

There's Nowhere Else.

Maybe You'd Rather I Quit.

Fine,

As Long As You
Return The Paint And Supplies

You Were Advanced
For Your Personal Use.

Good-Bye.

Do I Know You?

You Look Familiar.

You Don't.

Are You Always
This Friendly?

Only When I've
Just Been Fired.

Oh, Let Me Give You A Hand.

I'm Ashley.

Jonathan.

Oh.

Thanks.

Jonathan: I Know It's A Mess,
But Can I Give You A Lift?

Are You Kidding?

It's A Real Car!

Is It Yours?

Actually, It's A Van.

It's Not Completely
Paid For Yet,

But It's More Or Less Mine.

I'll Get That For You.
Oh.

Thank You.

You're, Um...

Different.

I'll...Take That
As A Compliment.

So, You Do, Like, What?

Stage Painting?

Um, Well, You Know,

Blackman Needed
Some Cheap Labor,

And I Needed Some Supplies
And A Space To Work.

Course, Now I
Don't Have Either.

I Have An Idea.

I'll Alert The Media.

Your Line.

Hey.
Hey.

Uh, Guys, Do You Mind
Helping Me Out A Little Bit?
Yeah, Yeah.

Thank You.

Uh, Mac,

This Is Jonathan.

Jonathan, This Is The Guy
That I Was Telling You About.
Hey.

Don't Tell Me.

Ashley Offered You
A Place To Work

If You Do A Simple
Backdrop For Our Play.

Yeah.

Uh, So Are You
In Charge Here?

Allegedly.

I'm Just A Volunteer.

Uh, What Do You Need?

An Area That's Off-Limits

<I>Would Be Really Helpful.</I>

Yeah. This Way.

Okay, Good Job, Everybody.

I'll Be Right Back.
Memorize Your Lines.

Ms. Lane, Kevin Took My Script
To The Bathroom

And Flushed It,
But It Wouldn't Go Down.

We'll See About That.

Jonathan?

Would You Mind Going
To The Little Boys' Room

And Retrieving Darlene's
Script Back, Please?

Hey, Um,

M-Maybe After We're
Finished Today,

I Could Give You
A Ride Home?

Unless You Have,
Like, Other Plans

Or Something.

No!

I Mean, Yes.

I Never Have Plans.

I-I Mean I Don't
Have Plans Today.

I--That Is...
Plans To Rehearse,

But Nothing After That.

I'd Love A Ride.

Okay.

Has Jason Left Already?

I Couldn't Wake Him.
He's Still Upstairs.

Don't Talk With Your
Mouth Full.

Have You Seen My
Diamond Earrings?

You Didn't Borrow Them
Or Anything, Did You?

No, I Haven't.

You've Been Looking Nice
Recently.

Well, I Have Been...

I've Been Talking
To This Guy, And--

Ahh.

Yeah, He's--
Oh, Just A Sec.

Hello?

Are You Serious?

What?!

I Needed Those Boards,
Like, Yesterday.

How Else Are We Gonna
Motivate These People
To Go Green?

Yes! Motivation, Okay?

What A Concept.

Where Have You Been, Girl?

You Haven't Answered
Any Of My Calls.

I've Been Worried.

I'm Not Living At Home
Anymore, So I Just...

Left My Phone There.

Where Are You Staying?

Are You All Right?

You Look Fabulous.

Thanks.

You Do, Too. Uh...

Do You Wanna
Do Something Tonight?

I Have To Figure Out How
To Costume 17 Kids

With No Money.

Wanna Help?

No, I Don't Think So.

Really Gotten Carried Away

With This Whole
Volunteering Thing, Huh?

Yeah, The Kids Love Doing It.

It'll Be Fun.

Besides, We Need To Talk.

Not Really.

Just--At Least Not Yet.

See You Around, Though.

Okay.

I've...Really Missed You.

Yeah, Me Too.

Hit The Showers, Men.

Hank.

Yeah, Coach?

What's Up With Lane?
Where Is He?

I--You'll Have To Ask Him,
Coach.

I'm Asking You.

Hi, Princess.

Hey.

What's Up?

So, You Know That Junk

That Mac Has Been
Cleaning Out Of The Garage?

Can I Have It?

Why Do You Want It?

To Sell.

You Know That Mack And I

Have Been Working On This
Christmas Play.

Mac Is Too Old For You.

Dad. Give Me Some Credit.

Ew.

Okay.

Ah, Whatever You Can
Make Off The Stuff
In The Garage

Is Yours To Keep.

Something Else?

Well, I...

Found This Poster Of Your Band
In The Garage.

You Guys Used To Rock.

You Were Hot.

Ashley.

How Would You
Like To Perform Again?
I Wouldn't.

Dad, Please?

Our Play Would Be So Huge
With Music.

<I>It's Just So...
Almost Now.</I>

This Production
Needs To Be Big.

Bill: You Want Me To Sing?

And Play Keyboard.

Hmm.

Well, Sharon And I
Used To Do Duets.

That's The Deal.

Me And Your Mom,

'Kay?

Wow.

Well, I--
I Guess That Could Work.

Okay, Well, I Gotta Go.

I Have A Date.

I'd Like To Meet Him.

This Date.

So I, Uh,

Used To Sneak
Into People's Back Yards

And Steal Charcoal
From The Barbeques

So I Could Draw My Murals
On Buildings And Sidewalks.

I Was Just A Kid.

Wow.

Your Neighbors
Must've Loved You.

We Were Never
Around Long Enough

For Anyone To Notice
One Way Or The Other.

But You Didn't Quit.

Jonathan: There Was One Person
Who Said I Had Potential.

It Was The Cop
That Caught Me.

Made Me Whitewash The Entire
Side Of The Building
I'd Just Finished.

That Sucks.

Turns Out The Owner Had Rented
It Out To A Billboard Company
For Big Bucks.

That Cop Got Me My First Job.

Priming Building Sides
For Advertising.

I've Had Way Worse
Jobs, Though.

A Way To Make Money.

What Made You Keep At It?

Would've Been Pretty Hard
To Stop Me.

Until Recently,

I Only Lived
And Breathed Painting.

Hey.

Jason's Not Here.

It's Nice To See You, Too.

Can I Come In?

Yeah, Sure.

I Need To Have 17 Costumes
Made For My Christmas Play.

How Much Are You Paying?

Well, Actually...Nothing.

But It's For A Good Cause.

Well, Please?

We're Practically Family.

I Barely Know You.

And Your Mother Won't Even
Stay In The Same Room With Me.

<I>Eh-- Step-Mother,
And Consider Yourself Lucky.</I>

Five Minutes With Her
And You're Late For The Door.

Whatever. I Still Need
To Earn Some Cash Now.

Um, We're Having A Garage
Sale Next Week.

Whatever We Make,
Over Our Expenses,

Is Yours.

Please Say You'll Help.

I'm Desperate.

Okay, I'll Tell You What.

If You'll Help Me
With These Alterations,

That'll Give Me Some Time
To Help You Make Costumes.

I Can't Sew.

I'll Teach You.

Otherwise, No Deal.

But I Don't Have Time
For Anything Else.

Welcome To My World.

Well, If You Really Think
Old "Brainless" Can Help.

Wow.

What Do You Think?

It's Great.

So You Wanna Try It?

Um, Sure.

I Don't...

Know What I'm Doing.

Just Try It.

Okay. Stick It In.

Mm-Hmm.

Does It Matter What This--

Mm-Mmm.
Is This--

We're Worried
About The Longer One.

Oop.

Yeah, Just--
I Don't Know.

Okay.
I Don't Know.

You Almost Had It. Look--

Got More Clothes.

Got Some Clothes For Ya.

Oh. Okay, Wait.

Wait. Before You
Put Them Down.

Right There.

Yeah. Just Dump 'Em.

It's A Little Big.

That Looks Good.

Ready?
Okay.

You're My Mannequin.

Okay. Fits Really Well--

Obviously
For A Smaller Person--

Have A Good Day.
You, Too.

Peace Out.

Okay.

You Know What?

Have A Good Day.
Thank You Very Much.

Let It Go For Seven Bucks.

What Do You Say?

Ashley: Nicki!

Hey.

You Changed Your Mind.

Uh, We Could Really
Use Your Help.

Yeah.

I'm Just Here To See What's
Been Keeping You So Busy.

Or Should I Say "Who"?

I'm So Over
Spending Time At Bars,

And I'm Glad You Are, Too.

This Is Much More Fun.

Yeah, Spare Me The Pep Talk.

I Know You.

Peace Offering.

That's Vodka.

Yeah, I Know.
It's Your Fave.
I Don't Do That Anymore.

Look, Neither You Or My Dad
Have Ever Gone Too Long
Without A Drink.

I Never Knew That You
Thought I Was Like Your Dad.

I'm Sorry.
I Don't.

Look, It's Been A Bad Week.

W-What's Going On?

You've Obviously
Been Too Busy To Care.

I Care.
You're My Best Friend!

But Nicki, I'm Finally
Doing Something That I Like.

Do It With Me.

I Don't Belong Here.

I Don't Belong Anywhere.

That's Not True.
I--I Want You To Meet Someone.

You Never Used To Argue
With Me Before.

Look, Go Back
To Your Friends.

Like Your Biker Buddy Said,

I Got A Lot Of Heavy Decisions
To Make Right Now.

I'll See You Later.

You've Met Ashley's
Friend Before?

Maybe.

Look, It Was Over
Three Years Ago.

Ashley Know About That?

It's Nobody Else's
Business But Mine.

Bill!

Can I Have A Word
With You?

All Right.

All Right.

You Okay. Come On.

It's Okay.

It's All Right.

It's All Right.

She'll Be All Right.

She Just
Shouldn't Lift Anything
With Her Condition.

Jason Will Never Speak To Me
If He Thinks I've Told Anyone.

This Isn't The Sort Of Thing
You Can Hide For Very Long.

What, You're--

You're Having Jason's Baby?

What's You Plans?

I'll Go To School
Until Christmas Break,

And Then...

I Don't Know.

It's Not The Most Complete
Set Of Plans I've Ever Heard.

It Needs Work.

What Does Jason
Propose To Do?

I Don't Know.
Okay, I Know Jason
Can Be A Real...

Weiner At Times,

But Deep Down,
He Really Does Care.

I Don't Think He
Wants Either Of Us.

He's Changed So Much.

Man: Hey, Could I
Get Some Help Over Here?

How Long Are Those People
Gonna Be In Our Yard?

Looks Like A Garage Sale.

Oh, Sharon.
Baby, It Is A Garage Sale.

Well It Makes Us Look Poor.

What Is This All About?

Seeing You Selling Off

All Of Amanda's Old Things.

It's Just--
I--

I Didn't Think You'd
Mind If We Sold Them.

Oh, Baby.

So Nice To See You
And Ashley Getting Along

Since She's
Been Doing The Play.

You Must Be Very Proud
That She's Doing Something
Creative, Huh?

I Am.

She's Certainly
Home A Lot More.

Mm-Hmm.

I Just Wish Jason Were.

And I Wish I Knew

Why Our Things
Keep Disappearing.

My Jewelry,
Money From Our Wallets.

And Now My Mother's Silver.

Yeah.

Oh, Baby.

Has It Ever Occurred To You
That It Might Be Jason?

He's Lost A Lot Of Weight.
He Does Not Look Good.

Bill, I'm Tired.

Could You Just Get Rid
Of Those People Soon?

You Betcha.
Thanks.

Hey, Mac.
Hey.

Let's Wrap This Up, Huh?

You Got It.
Been A Long Day, Huh?

Yes, Sir.

We Did Really Well--
So, We Have A Few More
Things To Sell.

Show Some Mercy!

I'm Beat.

We've Made 247

And 63 Cents.

That Means We Have Enough
To Buy The Rest Of The Supplies

And Pay Me Something.

Maybe A Little Left Over

For Some Paint And Canvas?

Ashley: You're Just In It
For The Paint.

Yeah--
And Just For That,

I Am Not Letting You
Take Me To Pizza Tonight.

Um, Actually,
Can I Take A Rain Check?

Something Sorta Came Up.

What?

Just Some Personal Stuff.

Okay.

Don't Let Me Interfere, Then.

Don't Be That Way.

Here, Just Take The Keys

And Get All The Rest
Of This--To Shelter,

And I'll Come By
And Pick It Up Later, Okay?

See You Later.

Bye.

You Know What?

Let's Just Do The Shelter Thing
Another Day.

You Take The Truck,
Get Some Rest,

Go Home, And...
I'll Call You Later.

Uh--Ashley! Tell Me You
Are Not Going To Follow Him.

Don't Worry.
I Know What I'm Doing.

I Heard Coach Let You Go.

Sorry, Buddy.

Yeah, Well You
Could've Covered For Me.

I've Been Sick.

I Tried To Cover.

He Didn't Buy It.

Everybody Knows You
Got A Problem.

Hey. You're My Friend!

But You're Whacked Out, Man.

You Need Help.

Hey.

Hi.

Nice Shirt.

Had These Made For Everyone
In The Play.

Long Time, No See.

I Didn't Think You'd
Even Remember Me.

I Mean, It's Been
Over Three Years.

And That Was A Pretty
Wild Night.

And Now You're
Dating My Best Friend.

Small World.

Yeah. Thing Is,

I Didn't Even Know You Two
Knew Each Other.

Is That A Problem For You?

Well, I Mean, Ashley's Just
Been So Busy With The Play,

And She's Just Beginning
To Have Confidence In Herself,

And...
And You?

And Me?

And, Well...

That Subject Just
Hasn't Come Up Yet.

You Know Me.
I'm Not Gonna Say Anything.

But...

She's Bound To Find Out
Sooner Or Later.

Later Would Be Better.

I'd Just Rather
Tell Her Myself.

So This A Real Thing?

Looks Like You've Been Taking
Pretty Good Care Of Yourself.

Had To.

Yeah.

You Had To Do It Alone.

I Just Couldn't Handle
Any Relationships At The Time.

But...I'm Here For You Now.

Don't Make Any Promises
You Can't Keep.

This Is Where I'm Staying.

Nobody Knows But Mac.

You're Pretty Great, Nicole.

What's The Matter, Nick?

Ken And The Bar Boys
Not Enough Action For You?

You Have
To Steal My Boyfriend?

This Is Too Funny.

I Know What This
Must Look Like,

But It's--

I'm Laughing.

Jonathan: Wha--

Have A Little Faith In Me.

I Do. Very Little.

Wanna Reconsider
That Promise?

What Are You
Doing In My Room?

"Sharon's Had It So Tough.

I'm Going To Take Care
Of Jason Until She's Ready."

Your Mother Never Really
Loved The Band Like I Did.

But She Loved Me And Bill.

We Thought We Were
Doing What She Wanted.

What Are You Talking About?

You're A Lot Like Her.

You're Both So Pretty.

Are You Okay?

I Watched You
Sell Amanda's Things.

Have You Been Stealing My Things
And Selling Them, Too?

Honestly, Sharon,
I Haven't.

No--Why Would I?

I Don't Know How
To Be A Good Mother.

You're Starting
To Freak Me Out.

Why Doesn't My Son Like Me?

I'm Gonna Go Get Daddy.

I've Pushed Bill Away.

Is He Gonna Leave Me, Too?

Why Don't You Just...

Give Me The Diary?

No!

No, No.

Sharon!

What Is Going On?

Hey, Sorry To Come By
So Late.

Your Mom's Not Home, Right?

No, Night Shift Again.
What's Wrong?

Everything.
Just Take This--

Most Of It's Yours, Anyway.

Okay, Well, Come In.

Well, Where's Jonathan?

With My Ex-Best Friend.

And Sharon's Freaking Out
About Something.

I Don't Know.

Will You Help Me
With This?

Yeah.

Men Are Pond Scum.

But...What Are You Gonna Do?

Honestly, I Have No Idea.

But I've Talked To God
About It,

And I Know That
He's Forgiven Me,

Which Is Definitely

More Than I Can
Say For My Mom At The Moment.

So You Talk To God Directly?

Of Course. Don't You?

Oh, Yeah, All The Time.

All I Know Is Jason
Needs To Get Off The Drugs.

Himself.

He Has To Decide.

Have You Decided

If You're Gonna
Keep The Baby, Or...

Go To School?

Both.

You Can't Be Anything
If You Haven't Finished School.

W-What Are You Gonna
Do When The Baby Comes?

Well My Mom
Won't Kick Me Out,

And Since She Works Nights,

She'll Be Able
To Watch The Baby
During The Day.

I'm Gonna Try To Work
For A Store Doing Alterations

So I Can Be With Her At Night.

I See You've
Decided It's A Girl.

Have You Named Her Yet?

Shut Up.


I'm Popular Tonight.

You Must Be The Angel.

I'm A Friend Of Jazz.

I Know Who You Are,
And You're Not Welcome Here.

Who Are You?!
Leave Her Alone!

Angelina's Mom
Has Already Called The Cops.

Your Brother's An Idiot.

Geo: I'm Not.

Whore's Mom Works Nights.

That's When He Gets
His Free Piece Of Ass.

Ain't That Right?

Jazz...

Is A Very Disappointing Boy.

But...You Already Knew That,
Didn't You?

Jason's Too Good For You.

Let Her Go, Geo.

Everybody's Here.

Nice.

I Said, "Let Her Go"!

The Money, Jazz!

I Don't Have It.

Search Him.

I Don't Have It!

Girl: What?!

Nothin'.

Then This Is Our
Lucky Night.

Bitch!

We're Gonna Try This Again.

This Time
I Want A Better Answer.

The Money Is Where?

It's Outside.

Under The Doormat.

I-I Brought It...

For The Baby.

Money.

You Give That Back!

Money.

Geo: Easy.

You're Okay.

Just Chill.

Ah!

The Lord Is My Shepherd.

I Shall Not Want.

He Maketh Me To Lie Down
In Green Pastures.

Oh...

He Leadeth Me
Beside Still Waters.

He Restores My Soul.

Shut Up With That
Religious Shit.
Yea, Though I Walk

Though The Valley
Of The Shadow Of Death...
Geo: Get The Money.

I Will Fear No Evil,
For You Are--
Where's The Money?

No.

Angelina:
Thy Rod And Thy Staff,

They Comfort Me.

O Lord, Please!

Angelina: Though The Valley
Of The Shadow Of Death.

Thy Rod And Thy Staff,
They Comfort Me.

You Prepareth A Table
In The Presence Of My Enemies.

Stop!!!

He Anointeth My Head
With Oil.

Get Geo.
Let's Get Out Of Here.

Surely Goodness And--

And Mercy Shall Follow Me
All The Days Of My Life.

Take It Easy.

You Don't
Wanna Hurt Anybody.

That Everything?

Pretty Much.

Okay.

Then, Um,

We're Done With You
For Now.

In The Morning, I'll Need You
To Come Down, And, Uh,

Identify The Accused.

Officer,

Do You Think We Could
Have Our Costume Money Back?

The Play Is Only
A Few Days Away.

Mmm, Right Now,
It's Still Evidence

Confiscated At The Scene
Of The Crime.

I Have To Have That Money.

Those Kids Are Counting On Me.

I-I Gave Them My Word.

I'm Sorry.
There's Nothing I Can Do.

So What Made You
Come Tonight?

I Needed To See You.

But When You Weren't Home,
I Figured You
Were At Angelina's.

After Your Date With Nicole?

It Wasn't A Date.

I Mean, I Wish You Would
Just Listen To Me So I Could--

Let Me Go!

Give Him The Sedative Now.
Let Me Go! Let Me Go!

<I>Jason: Let Me Go!</I>

Is Jason Gonna
Be All Right?

The Gunshot Wounds
Were Superficial.

He Had So Many Drugs
In His System

That He's Actually Doing Better
Now With The Transfusions

We've Given Him.

Can You Help Him?

I Mean, With The Addiction?

We Can Monitor And Assist
With Withdrawal Now.

But Ultimately,
Whether He Stays Clean,

It's Up To Him.
Right.

H-How Soon Can He Come Home?

He Could Go To Jail.

But I Am Recommending

That He Sign Himself
Into A Rehab Center.

Oh, Thank You So Much.

No, Jason--Jason--
Oh.

Is Not Going To Jail.

Hey, Hey,
Hey, Hey, Hey.

<I>That's Our Son
Lying Back There.</I>

<I>And That's Our Daughter
That Almost Got Shot.</I>

God!

Oh, My God.
Oh, Baby.

Oh, God.

Sharon.

I Haven't Always
Done What's Right In The Past.

I Know That. But--

Bill!

Our Whole World
Is Falling Apart.

Let Me Finish.

What I Want
To Tell You, Baby--

Nothing In Our Lives

Has Worked Out
The Way We Wanted.

But Believe It Or Not,
Baby, I Love You,

And I Want Our Family
To Work.

It's Up To Us
To Work Things Out.

Look At Me.

Oh, Oh, Come Here.

Come Here, Baby.

My Girl.

Who's My Girl?

I Am.

I Really Enjoyed Practicing
With You The Other Day.

Me Too.

More Than You Know.

I Love You.

I Love You, Too.

I'm Caught.

I'm Caught.
Stand Still.

Stand Still.
You're Making It Worse.

Stand Still.
Get It Loose, Bill!

Baby, You're Gonna Make It--
Get It Loose!

Why'd You Come
Get Me Anyway, Huh?

Friends Don't Let Friends
Drive Drunk.

Sharon: You Can Be A Real
Pain In The Butt Sometimes.

But I Love You, Girl

I Love You... 
Okay, Sharon--

Oh, Oh, It's Caught!

Wait, Sharon--

Sharon: Amanda, Look Out!

Calm Down.

I'm Here.

Oh, Baby.

What Is The Matter?

What Is The Matter?

I Was Just
Trying To Hug Her.

All My Fault.

It Was All My Fault.
No.

It Was An Accident.

I Forgive You.

You've Got
To Forgive Yourself.

Okay?

I Can't.

I Loved Her So Much.

Oh, Baby.

We Both Did.

But That Was Another Life.

You're Not Leaving? Now?

What About Me?

You're Off To A Good Start.

I Lost The Money
For The Play,

My Best Friend And My Boyfriend
Are Cheating On Me,

And Angelina And Jason
Are In The Hospital.

And Now You're Leaving.

See You At The Shelter.

Won't Be The Same.

Nothing Ever Is.

But You've Got 17 Kids
Counting On You.

I'm Gonna Go
See Angelina Right Now.

I'll Catch Up
With You Later.

Mac?

Will You Check On Jason
For Me?

Um, Make Sure
That He's Okay?

If He Needs Anything.

I'll Do Better Than That.

You Think Visiting Hours
Apply To Chairs?

Where'd You Get That?

From Your Friends
Down At The Shop.

It's A Piece Of Trash.

No. Like You,
It's A Real Piece Of Work.

And, Like You,
It's Just Not Finished Yet.

Although, It Looks Considerably
Better Than You At The Moment.

You Think They'll
Let Me Work On It?

At The Rehab Center?

Sure. They're...

Bound To Need Better Chairs
Down There.

So What's Next?

None Of Your Business.

Who Are You, Anyway?

A Friend Of Angelina's.

How Is She?

Nobody Tells Me Anything
Around Here.

They Treat Me
Like A Criminal.

What's So Funny?

<I>You Are A Criminal.</I>

I Did It For Angel.

So She Could Keep The Baby.

They Didn't Tell You?

She Lost The Baby.

She Said You Didn't Want It.

Look, Uh...

Thanks For The Rocker.

Just, Please--
Just Leave Me Alone.

This Is Between Angel And Me.

We'll Work It Out.

Maybe.

Maybe Not.

She Hasn't
Regained Consciousness Yet.

The Doctors Don't
Expect Her To Make It.

Please! Wait, Wait, Wait.

Wait.

Just Please...

Just Help Me.

Help You Do What?

Just Gotta See Angel.

And Please Just
Talk To Somebody.

If You're Really Her Friend,

You Know She'll Want Me
To Be There.

She's All Alone.
Just Please Let Me See Her.

She Doesn't
Need Your Guilt Right Now.

She Needs Your Love,

Your Faith,

And Your Prayers.

Look...

I Know That I Am Not
Worth Her Little Finger...

But She's The Only Person
That I Really Loved.

She Always Wanted Me
To Say That To Her,

But I Never Did.

I'll See What I Can Do.

You Know You Can
Make A Difference
If You're Willing To Change.

The Greatest Man In The Universe
Was A Simple Carpenter.

And His Life...

Changed This Planet.

Another Volunteer.

Hi, I'm Nicki.

Watch The Sticky Fingers.

I Got A Heavy Date Tonight.

<I>What Is This Sack
You Are Wearing?</I>

I'm Mary, The Virgin.

And This Is My Costume.

Well, No Wonder.

You're Never Gonna
Get A Guy Looking Like That.

Hey, Makeovers
Are What I Do.

Come On.

I'd Prefer You
Didn't Bring Her Here.

Has Anyone Ever Told You
How Extremely Irritating
You Can Be?

It Wasn't A Date!

In Two Weeks, Nicole
Is Going To Have To Testify

Against Her Own Father
In Court.

What Does That
Have To Do With You?

My Mom Left Us
When I Was A Kid.

My Dad Turned Into A Lush.

I Used To Go By The Bars
After School To Help
Work Off His Bill.

Nicole Used To Come By
And Pick Up Her Old Man.

He Was Usually Passed Out
In A Corner Somewhere.

It Was Kind Of
A Regular Routine.

We Never Really Talked Much.

Well,

One Day, My Old Man
Started A Fight.

I Tried Stopping Him
And Ended Up Getting Hammered

Between Him
And Nicole's Dad.

Bartender Called The Police,

And All Of Us
Were Hauled Off To Jail.

Nicole And I
Were Given A Choice.

Could Go Back Home,

Or We Could Press Charges

And Have To Live As A Ward
Of The State.

Nicole Was Younger,
So She Went Back Home.

I Left And...

I Never Looked Back

When I Was Old Enough,

I Left The State Home,

And I've Been
Supporting Myself Ever Since.

Her Dad Turned
Into A Mean Drunk.

She's Been Living
On His Unemployment,

Getting Meals From Guys,

Shoplifting, Whatever.

Well If It Was That Bad
For Nicole,

Then Why Did She
Take Me To Bars?

It's What She Knows.

It Was Way Better
Than Staying At Home
With Her Old Man.

Can You Help Her?

Be Easier If...

She Had A Few
Friends Around.

I Will Be.

Sorry.

Look, Am I Gonna Have To Fix
All These Costumes By Myself?

I Mean, Look At Them.

<I>Without Me, You Would
Have No Fashion Sense.</I>

Zip. Nada.

I Mean, Really?

Come On--
Oh--Okay.

I Get It.

Do You Think You Could Help

With Makeup, Too?

Duh.

And Can We Get, Like,
Little Halos Or Something?

I Mean, You Can't Really
Be An Angel Without Them.

Don't See Why Not.

Just Give Me Tin Foil

<I>And Lots Of Glitter.</I>

I'll Be Right Outside.

I'm So Sorry, Angel.

I Know--I Know
I Screwed Up Big-Time.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You Never Did Anything

In Your Entire Life
To Deserve This.

I-I Love You
So Much, Baby.

I'd Give Anything--

Anything To Have Things
Back The Way They Were.

I Would.

Angel's God...

I Need To Talk To You.

I Need To Talk To You.

She Would--

She Would Always
Talk To You

Like You Were Her Friend.

She Told Me That
She Prayed For Me.

It--

It Must've Worked
Because I'm Still Here, Right?

I Never Prayed For Her.

Never.

And I Know That's Wrong...

On Account That
She's In Real Trouble Now,

And It's All My Fault.

She Told Me That--

That Jesus...

Jesus Went To Hell For Me...

To Pay For What I Did.

To Pay For--

To Pay For What I Did.

He Must've Been
Tough As Shit, Because...

I Can't Handle
This Hell I'm In.

I Understand That, Uh...

That You Rose Yourself
From The Dead.

I Get It.

I Believe It. I Do.

I Believe It.

Believe It.

So It's Not Like--

It's Not Like It's A Big Deal
For You To Get Her Out Of This
Coma, Right?

Right?

I Know--

I Know That I Fucked Up.

She Told Me

That You Forgive Everybody.

Even Shits Like Me.

If You Can--
If You Can Do Anything,

Anything With My Life...

You Can Have It.

Just, Please,

Please,

Don't Let Angel Die.

Don't Let Her Die On Me.

She's My Best Friend.
I'm So Sorry.

I Love You, Baby.

I Love You.

Thank You. All Right.
That's For The Animals.

Slow Down.
You're Going Too Fast.

Can I Please Have All My Angels
On The Steps Over Here?

I Forgot What I'm
Supposed To Say.

Just Remember
Why You Need The Room,

And You'll
Say The Right Thing.

Hey, Nicole,

Where's That Glittery
Star You Made?

I Mean, I've Got A Rig

And A Slot,
But No Star.

Shepherds, Pay Attention.

When Watching
Over Your Flock At Night,

Do Not--Repeat, Do Not
Step On The Electrical Cords.

Okay, Here We Go.
And A Five, Six, Seven, Eight.

Girl: Hey, You Didn't
Say, "And A One, And A Two,
And A Three."

All Right, I'll Give You
A One And A Two.

Kevin, Stop
Picking Your Nose, Buddy.

Who's There?

What Do You Want?

Fear Not.
You're Extremely
Flavored Of The Lord.

What's That Mean?

<I>God Loves You,
And He Picked You</I>

To Be The Mother
Of His Kid.

You Know, The Son Of God.

Uh-Uh! I'm A Virgin.

Uh-Huh.
So What Do I Do?

Nothing. God Will
Take Care Of Everything,

Including Talking To Joseph
About It.

Okay. If You Say So.

Hey, Joe, Wake Up.

Mary's With Child.
Say What?

She's Pregnant.

<I>I Didn't Do Anything.</I>

We Know, We Know.

She Really Is A Virgin.

<I>What Do You
Want Meto Do?</I>

First, Marry Her.

But Don't Touch Her.

Then, Name The Baby Jesus.

Anything Else?

Yeah, Take Good Care
Of Them.

I'll Be Bringing
More Instructions Later.

<I>Kevin: Caesar Was Disgusted
And Sent Everyone Home
To Be Taxed.</I>

My Wife's Having A Baby.

<I>Let Me It.
Child: No!</I>

You're Supposed To Say,
"There's No Room At The Inn!"

<I>I Said "No," Didn't I?</I>

What Do We Do?

<I>You Can Sleep
In The Barn If You Want.
Thanks.</I>

The Star Stopped.

Look! There's The Castle
Over There.

Well, The Lights Are On.
So They Must Still Be Up.

Boy: Hi, We're Very Wise Men.

<I>And Wise Woman.
I'm Horrid.</I>

We've Been Following His Star
For A Very Long Time.

Then You Must Be Hungry.

Come Enjoy Some Twinkies

While I Check It Out
With My Wise Guys.

<I>My Boys Say If It's True,</I>

He's Supposed To Be Born
In Bethlehem.

Boy: Where's That?

Not Too Far From Here.

I'll Show You On My G.P.S.

Thanks.

Just A Minute.

You Owe Me Now.

So When You Find Out
Where He Is, You Let Me Know.

<I>Do You Want
To Worship Him, Too?</I>

Yeah. Me And The Boys

Are Gonna Pay Him
A Little Visit.

Hey, How Your Sheep Doing?

They're Okay.

But I'm Bored.

<I>Nothing Ever Happens
In Bethlehem.</I>

When I'm Old Enough,
I'm Going To Jerusalem,

Be A Tax Collector.

Hark! Herald Angels
Are Singing!

Fear Not.

Behold, I Bring You
Good Tidings

Of Great Joy
Which Shall Be

To All People.

Which Means?

Good News For Everybody.

Unto You Is Born,
This Day, In The City Of David,

A Savior,
Which Is Christ The Lord.

This Shall Be A Sign To You:

You Shall Find A Babe
Wrapped In Swaddling Clothes,

Lying In A Manger.

What Are Swaddling Clothes?

Kevin: Pampers, Dummy.

Let's Check It Out.

What About Our Sheep?

Bring 'Em With.

Glory To God In The Highest.

And On Earth, Peace.

Goodwill To All Men.

We, Uh, Took Up A Collection
At The Station,

And Thought Maybe You
Could Use This To Buy
Some Presents For The Kids.

I Love You, Ashley.

I Love You, Too, Jonathan.

So This Is Christmas.
