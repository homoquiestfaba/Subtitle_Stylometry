<b>All the names of these /</b>

<b>The four quite oddly</b>

<b>Sorry, bravery And pride</b>

<b>I feel didnt 30 minutes</b>

<b>[music playing]</b>

<b>I swear to God, if you</b>

<b>pick up one more ball,</b>

<b>any ball, for as long as you</b>

<b>live, you're a dead boy walking.</b>

<b>[groaning]</b>

<b>[moaning]</b>

<b>- Oh, my God. - Honey, are you OK?</b>

<b>- What happened? - What happened to Adam?</b>

<b>I was smacked into the baseball at me,</b>

<b>through a window, through the glass.</b>

<b>That's a lie, you little weasel.</b>

<b>Sam, that nose ring wouldn't really</b>

<b>fly up military school, do you think?</b>

<b>Mom, Adam's smirking.</b>

<b>Look at him.</b>

<b>Hey, get up.</b>

<b>Who taught you that girls were stupid?</b>

<b>Huh? I know it wasn't me.</b>

<b>So let me give you a</b>

<b>word of warning, pal.</b>

<b>You can only push us</b>

<b>so far before we snap.</b>

<b>You know, the hormone thing?</b>

<b>So you get up, you get that ball,</b>

<b>and you bring it to me right now.</b>

<b>[clicking]</b>

<b>Save the drama. We're all on to you.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>And you're paying for the window.</b>

<b>But I--</b>

<b>[sighing]</b>

<b>[clicking]</b>

<b>Thanks for waiting.</b>

<b>He didn't call. We were hungry.</b>

<b>I figured you'd be really late, as usual.</b>

<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

<b>He did miss all the excitement, though.</b>

<b>Adam broke another window.</b>

<b>What does that make this year, honey, 10?</b>

<b>It's a good thing your dad worked so hard</b>

<b>to pay for all that.</b>

<b>You said I had to pay for it.</b>

<b>May I?</b>

<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

<b>Since you're only 12 and</b>

<b>you don't really have a job,</b>

<b>your money isn't really yours at all.</b>

<b>Yes, it is. It's my allowance.</b>

<b>Where do you think that money comes from?</b>

<b>Dad, you idiot.</b>

<b>All right, everybody, calm down, please.</b>

<b>Excitement's over.</b>

<b>May I?</b>

<b>[sighing]</b>

<b>Jessica.</b>

<b>Jack, we need to talk.</b>

<b>About what?</b>

<b>About this relationship.</b>

<b>Oh, God.</b>

<b>Please, just not again.</b>

<b>All we do is fight.</b>

<b>I don't want to live that way anymore.</b>

<b>Everybody fights.</b>

<b>Some people say they're married their</b>

<b>whole lives with a lot</b>

<b>less love than we have.</b>

<b>I don't want to be one of those people.</b>

<b>I don't want to spend the rest of my life</b>

<b>regretting that we all had a chance to be</b>

<b>happy and didn't take it.</b>

<b>We're not good together anymore.</b>

<b>Come on, Katie.</b>

<b>We can try one more time.</b>

<b>Don't we have other</b>

<b>kids at least that much?</b>

<b>We can go see that therapist guy.</b>

<b>We tried that. It hasn't worked.</b>

<b>Don't you remember when</b>

<b>we were first married?</b>

<b>And you thought I was</b>

<b>funny and sexy and attractive?</b>

<b>You don't even laugh at my jokes anymore.</b>

<b>You haven't wanted to touch me in ages.</b>

<b>And in the past few</b>

<b>years, nothing I do is right.</b>

<b>I think it's destroying all of us.</b>

<b>I don't understand how this happened.</b>

<b>[sighs]</b>

<b>Okay, okay. I'll go find a place.</b>

<b>You stay here with the kids.</b>

<b>Kids need their moms a lot</b>

<b>more than they need their dads.</b>

<b>Well, that's not true.</b>

<b>Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.</b>

<b>You guys should stay here.</b>

<b>I don't think we</b>

<b>should tell them right away.</b>

<b>At least not until you find a place.</b>

<b>Right.</b>

<b>It wasn't all bad, was it?</b>

<b>No, Jack, it wasn't.</b>

<b>We have two great kids, don't we?</b>

<b>Yeah, we do.</b>

<b>[sighs]</b>

<b>What am I gonna do?</b>

<b>â™ª Living alone â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª I think about the friends I love â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª But when I die, how</b>

<b>do you tell a phone â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Nobody's home â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª All by myself â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Don't wanna be all by myself â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Even though it's hard to be sure â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Sometimes I feel so insecure â™ª</b>

<b>Funny, I'm whole.</b>

<b>â™ª And I love so distant and obscure â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª And I love so distant and obscure â™ª</b>

<b>â™ª Living alone â™ª</b>

<b>I get it. I get it.</b>

<b>[gunshot]</b>

<b>Take the nose ring out, dear.</b>

<b>We don't do that sort of thing here.</b>

<b>â™ª You're there â™ª</b>

<b>Thanks for dressing.</b>

<b>You want a little sherry, dear?</b>

<b>Yes, please.</b>

<b>I don't believe I was speaking to you.</b>

<b>Nothing for me, thanks, Mother.</b>

<b>Mary?</b>

<b>- Hi, guys. - Hi, Mary.</b>

<b>- Hi, Mary. - Mary, can</b>

<b>I have a small sherry?</b>

<b>Yes, you can, if you get it yourself.</b>

<b>And I can't cook your whole damn dinner</b>

<b>and serve cocktails, too.</b>

<b>Nor should you, Mary. I'll do it.</b>

<b>Dorothy, what can I get for you?</b>

<b>What I've had every</b>

<b>single night of my life</b>

<b>for the last 50 years, Jack?</b>

<b>- Sherry. - Right.</b>

<b>Kate.</b>

<b>- Kids? - Coke.</b>

<b>It'll rot your teeth.</b>

<b>What do you know?</b>

<b>Children, why don't</b>

<b>you go help your father?</b>

<b>Well, I suppose we can sit down.</b>

<b>Oh, can we?</b>

<b>Keep it up and I'll</b>

<b>leave everything to Mary.</b>

<b>So, what cause have</b>

<b>you taken up this week?</b>

<b>And do bleeding-heart</b>

<b>liberals ever bleed to death?</b>

<b>Could we please not do this, Mother?</b>

<b>Fine. I'll change the subject.</b>

<b>Did you and Jack have</b>

<b>another fight today?</b>

<b>No, we're not fighting anymore, Mother.</b>

<b>We're separating.</b>

<b>So you've had no experience in sales?</b>

<b>No, sure I have.</b>

<b>I sell things to my family all the time.</b>

<b>Like eating</b>

<b>vegetables, doing their homework,</b>

<b>you know, things they don't want to do.</b>

<b>That's the ultimate hard sell.</b>

<b>Well, that's not exactly</b>

<b>what we're selling here.</b>

<b>What I really need is someone with sales</b>

<b>and fashion</b>

<b>experience, and you're not it.</b>

<b>I wouldn't exactly call</b>

<b>what you sell here fashion.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>I don't know what I would do with you.</b>

<b>Nice drapes, Martha.</b>

<b>You look fabulous.</b>

<b>You won't be single for long, honey.</b>

<b>No, what, you're not hair stylish,</b>

<b>you're not a manicurist, right?</b>

<b>You're nothing to--</b>

<b>What are you?</b>

<b>Guess I'm someone who knew that streaks</b>

<b>are pretty much finished in the '90s.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Oh, hey, streaks are not--</b>

<b>[phone ringing]</b>

<b>I think we should show</b>

<b>it the week of the 10th,</b>

<b>and let's book the inspection.</b>

<b>When can we get, what, the 15th?</b>

<b>Yes, I'd like to have all that done.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Terrific.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>Can I help you?</b>

<b>Or do you just want</b>

<b>to stand there all day?</b>

<b>I was thinking about</b>

<b>standing here all day.</b>

<b>Sit yourself.</b>

<b>Want to know why?</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

<b>Not the hell.</b>

<b>It's a little slow.</b>

<b>I got time.</b>

<b>Because if you're a</b>

<b>woman rapidly approaching 40,</b>

<b>and you've made the</b>

<b>unbelievably stupid mistake</b>

<b>of thinking that trying to</b>

<b>raise a family was a good thing,</b>

<b>all you ever wanted to do</b>

<b>was be a wife and a mother,</b>

<b>and your children grow up, and they can't</b>

<b>wait to get away from you, and your</b>

<b>marriage is falling apart,</b>

<b>so you try to start over</b>

<b>with no skills whatsoever.</b>

<b>And all you hear is that</b>

<b>damn song all by myself,</b>

<b>then you would just stand here, too.</b>

<b>You're right.</b>

<b>That song's irritating.</b>

<b>You want to come in for a cup of coffee?</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Brad, Mack, this is--</b>

<b>what's your name?</b>

<b>I'm Kate, Kate Mayer.</b>

<b>Hey, Kate, I'm Maggie.</b>

<b>Hi, Maggie.</b>

<b>Which one's Brad and which one's Mack?</b>

<b>Hi, I'm Brad.</b>

<b>I'm just kidding.</b>

<b>I'm McNally, Mack for short.</b>

<b>And this is Brad, just Brad.</b>

<b>Kate's having a really bad day.</b>

<b>She doesn't know</b>

<b>whether to go left or right,</b>

<b>so I invited her in for a cup of Choke.</b>

<b>Great.</b>

<b>Let me get that.</b>

<b>Cream, sugar, black, please.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Hey, why don't you come take a load off?</b>

<b>Brad?</b>

<b>She won't buy.</b>

<b>Take a break.</b>

<b>Here you go.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>I'm sorry about all this.</b>

<b>I was just having a moment out there,</b>

<b>and Maggie here took pity on me.</b>

<b>No, it's fine, really.</b>

<b>No explanation needed.</b>

<b>Look at who I have working for me.</b>

<b>If I didn't hate you</b>

<b>already, I'd take offense to that.</b>

<b>See what I mean?</b>

<b>You don't really need a receptionist.</b>

<b>You're not just offering me this job</b>

<b>because you feel sorry for me.</b>

<b>Assume to be separated, mother of two.</b>

<b>No, I really need a receptionist.</b>

<b>Maggie and I are out all the time,</b>

<b>and Brad doesn't like</b>

<b>to answer the phone, so--</b>

<b>Does he ever talk?</b>

<b>You know, it's not</b>

<b>really a people person.</b>

<b>He's brilliant, just not a people person.</b>

<b>Kind of a bad job for him</b>

<b>to happen, don't you think?</b>

<b>Yeah, he's working on it.</b>

<b>OK, so when do you want me to start?</b>

<b>Well, when's good for you?</b>

<b>How's tomorrow? - Great.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>That's terrific.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Thank you very much.</b>

<b>You're welcome.</b>

<b>We'll see you tomorrow.</b>

<b>Yeah, terrific.</b>

<b>Bye.</b>

<b>Bye-bye.</b>

<b>So you hired him?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>She's cute.</b>

<b>Oh, shut up.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>How was your day?</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>I got a job.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>Repeat back to me what I just said.</b>

<b>You-- you said you had a</b>

<b>good day and you did the usual.</b>

<b>You don't do that in court, do you?</b>

<b>Do what?</b>

<b>Makeup stuff.</b>

<b>No, I don't make up stuff.</b>

<b>I just said I got a job.</b>

<b>How you got the usual out of that?</b>

<b>I'm not sure.</b>

<b>Wait a second.</b>

<b>You got a job?</b>

<b>What kind of job?</b>

<b>I'm going to be a</b>

<b>receptionist at a real estate office.</b>

<b>A receptionist?</b>

<b>That'll barely cover sitter costs.</b>

<b>What is the point of that?</b>

<b>I mean, come on, Kate.</b>

<b>Isn't that kind of</b>

<b>silly and counterproductive?</b>

<b>Maybe it is, but you got</b>

<b>to start somewhere, Jack.</b>

<b>Bye.</b>

<b>Good morning.</b>

<b>Va-Va-Voom.</b>

<b>Keep your hands off of her, Mac.</b>

<b>I'm gay.</b>

<b>Maggie thinks it's</b>

<b>hysterically funny to make</b>

<b>little homophobic jokes about it.</b>

<b>You're gay?</b>

<b>Yeah, but don't</b>

<b>worry, it's not contagious.</b>

<b>I bet she's never met a gay person</b>

<b>ever less than personal.</b>

<b>How is that possible in 2002?</b>

<b>No, no, no.</b>

<b>I've met a few.</b>

<b>It's just they don't</b>

<b>usually look like you, do they?</b>

<b>I've got a plaid shirt I could slip into.</b>

<b>I tried it once.</b>

<b>Wasn't my cup of tea.</b>

<b>I don't know who really asked you.</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>But if this bothers you--</b>

<b>No, no.</b>

<b>Actually, I think it</b>

<b>probably makes you more interesting</b>

<b>than I thought you were.</b>

<b>Really?</b>

<b>I didn't mean that.</b>

<b>What I meant to say was, I think people</b>

<b>should be able to be whoever they are.</b>

<b>This is your desk.</b>

<b>We set it up for you.</b>

<b>So there you go.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>You just answer the phones, haze realty,</b>

<b>you know, transfer calls, take messages.</b>

<b>That's it?</b>

<b>And that's it.</b>

<b>It's kind of like</b>

<b>stealing money, isn't it?</b>

<b>It is kind of.</b>

<b>You know, I think the point to this job</b>

<b>is to have some fun.</b>

<b>Because most of us here haven't had much.</b>

<b>We are the walking wounded.</b>

<b>I am not the walking wounded.</b>

<b>Yes, you are.</b>

<b>No, I'm not.</b>

<b>Yes, you are.</b>

<b>I don't know why I</b>

<b>put up with this abuse.</b>

<b>How'd you love us?</b>

<b>No, I don't.</b>

<b>Yes, you did.</b>

<b>No, I don't.</b>

<b>See, it's not really like stealing money.</b>

<b>Thanks, you guys.</b>

<b>You're making my reentry painless.</b>

<b>Our pleasure.</b>

<b>If you want to see your</b>

<b>kids, then we'll lock up.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Good night.</b>

<b>Night.</b>

<b>Have a good one.</b>

<b>You too.</b>

<b>You like her.</b>

<b>I can tell.</b>

<b>Will you stop trying to set</b>

<b>me up with every woman that</b>

<b>walks through that damn door?</b>

<b>You know what?</b>

<b>You're an idiot.</b>

<b>Because you believe if a person is gay,</b>

<b>that they like all</b>

<b>people of the same sex.</b>

<b>That we are</b>

<b>indiscriminate, shark-like creatures who</b>

<b>never sleep or are just</b>

<b>looking for our next victim.</b>

<b>Well, guess what?</b>

<b>Some of us actually do discriminate</b>

<b>and don't want to sleep with</b>

<b>every woman who ever lived.</b>

<b>Which, by the way, if that were true,</b>

<b>would include our mothers.</b>

<b>And yes, I like her.</b>

<b>News flash, I like you too.</b>

<b>Doesn't mean I want to</b>

<b>sleep with you either.</b>

<b>Got it?</b>

<b>Got it.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>Let's go, guys.</b>

<b>Should I forward calls to yourself?</b>

<b>No, you won't be able to.</b>

<b>Are you going to be out of rage?</b>

<b>No, you will be.</b>

<b>You're going to put us on the caravan.</b>

<b>It's a caravan.</b>

<b>Jeez, have you read any</b>

<b>magazines, a book, anything?</b>

<b>A caravan's where all the</b>

<b>brokers go on to see all the new</b>

<b>houses that are on the market.</b>

<b>Hey, isn't Brad coming?</b>

<b>You know, he doesn't like the caravans.</b>

<b>Well, why does he come on you?</b>

<b>For sure.</b>

<b>Ready?</b>

<b>I know it's one of my</b>

<b>business, but it seems like Brad's</b>

<b>not very good at his job.</b>

<b>That is correct.</b>

<b>Why does it Mac fire him?</b>

<b>You didn't hear this from me, but Brad</b>

<b>used to be a computer</b>

<b>geek at a dot com.</b>

<b>It went under, and Mac brought him here.</b>

<b>Besides, Mac could never fire anyone.</b>

<b>It's loyalty to the</b>

<b>point of absurdity, isn't it?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>This is the part you</b>

<b>really didn't hear from me.</b>

<b>He's her ex-lover's brother.</b>

<b>Well, why doesn't she help him?</b>

<b>That'd be hard.</b>

<b>She's dead.</b>

<b>Yuck.</b>

<b>Maggie.</b>

<b>Sorry.</b>

<b>I think it has potential.</b>

<b>You think everything has potential.</b>

<b>Sorry, she scraped off those crud.</b>

<b>She's too.</b>

<b>She got the new light.</b>

<b>She should get the premade ready to hang</b>

<b>cabinets, get a whole</b>

<b>new line of the cheap</b>

<b>old steel appliances.</b>

<b>He did white white, and</b>

<b>it's a gay man's dream.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Am I right?</b>

<b>[phone ringing]</b>

<b>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [phone ringing]</b>

<b>Hey, it's realty.</b>

<b>May I ask who's calling, please?</b>

<b>Just one moment.</b>

<b>It's a Mr. Brubaker.</b>

<b>Hello, Mr. Brubaker.</b>

<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

<b>Great.</b>

<b>When can I bring over the paperwork?</b>

<b>Uh-huh.</b>

<b>No, tomorrow morning's fine.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Bye-bye.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>You have a tradition here.</b>

<b>Any time a house is sold, we</b>

<b>go out and celebrate my treat.</b>

<b>Girl, I'll be light and drunk.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>You want to come?</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

<b>I'll ask Jack to stay with the kids.</b>

<b>You know, I have a suggestion.</b>

<b>Let's just tell him you</b>

<b>have a business meeting.</b>

<b>I think about the</b>

<b>drinking and drunk part.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Call him from the car.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>[music playing]</b>

<b>[phone ringing]</b>

<b>Hey, JJ.</b>

<b>Hey, hey, guys.</b>

<b>How you doing?</b>

<b>All right.</b>

<b>Now, was he a purchase</b>

<b>price, a selling price?</b>

<b>You bet.</b>

<b>All right.</b>

<b>My round.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>[laughter]</b>

<b>And so this guy says, does the carpet</b>

<b>come with the house?</b>

<b>And I say, it's wall to wall.</b>

<b>What do you think?</b>

<b>And then he says, I don't know.</b>

<b>And then I said, you're</b>

<b>going to make this more on it</b>

<b>than I've ever met.</b>

<b>And then I said--</b>

<b>It's like a damn</b>

<b>miniseries with no end to it.</b>

<b>Not unlike South Pacific, nice scenery,</b>

<b>no real point to it.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Now you speak.</b>

<b>By the way, it wasn't a miniseries.</b>

<b>It was a play, then a movie,</b>

<b>then a badly miscast TV movie.</b>

<b>By the way, I hate you.</b>

<b>[laughter]</b>

<b>I think it's time for another round.</b>

<b>Yeah, Brad, you're buying.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Mac always pays.</b>

<b>Yeah, well, her money is your money.</b>

<b>So what difference does it make?</b>

<b>Hey, what's it like being gay?</b>

<b>Well, you don't beat</b>

<b>around the bush, do you?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>What's it like having blue eyes?</b>

<b>You know, I think I</b>

<b>must be a little bit drunk,</b>

<b>because maybe that was an</b>

<b>incredibly stupid question</b>

<b>to ask you.</b>

<b>Oh, that's OK.</b>

<b>I think gay is kind of like</b>

<b>being part of a freak show.</b>

<b>You know, people like to</b>

<b>stop by the cage and stare.</b>

<b>I think what I meant</b>

<b>was, when did you first</b>

<b>know that you were attracted to women?</b>

<b>Like, when did you</b>

<b>decide, that's it, I'm gay?</b>

<b>It's not really a decision.</b>

<b>And I think I've always known.</b>

<b>Must be hard.</b>

<b>Is it hard?</b>

<b>Well, you get to</b>

<b>disappoint a lot of people,</b>

<b>starting with your parents.</b>

<b>Oh my god, my mother, who</b>

<b>is the most judgmental person</b>

<b>alive, would have a field day with that.</b>

<b>Mom, not only have I disappointed you</b>

<b>as a daughter, a wife, a</b>

<b>mother, and a homemaker,</b>

<b>but I've decided to sleep with women.</b>

<b>I ought to say it just to piss her off.</b>

<b>Yeah, that'd probably do it.</b>

<b>Honey, I'm home.</b>

<b>Hey, Bob.</b>

<b>Hey, you've got a good one.</b>

<b>Hey, you've got a good one.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

<b>Let's go. Come on.</b>

<b>Let's go.</b>

<b>So this is just to show you</b>

<b>what we deal with, you know?</b>

<b>But don't be daunted by this couple.</b>

<b>They've interviewed</b>

<b>every real little tale, OK?</b>

<b>Well, we haven't been happy</b>

<b>about what any of you people</b>

<b>have said in terms of your commissions.</b>

<b>We're too high.</b>

<b>It's as simple as that.</b>

<b>Well, the normal commission is 6%,</b>

<b>so what were the other agents asking for?</b>

<b>3%. Uh-huh. 3%.</b>

<b>Well, I'm new, but it seems</b>

<b>to me that at either of those</b>

<b>numbers, you're going to get an agent</b>

<b>who's not going to work</b>

<b>very hard at selling your house, and you</b>

<b>want to move to Florida</b>

<b>sooner rather than later, am I right?</b>

<b>Also, I noticed some</b>

<b>problems with your foundation,</b>

<b>not to mention the fact</b>

<b>that Mac here is the best agent</b>

<b>in town, which means you'll get a higher</b>

<b>price for your house,</b>

<b>making lower commission</b>

<b>a moot point, am I right?</b>

<b>[music playing]</b>

<b>Problems with your foundation.</b>

<b>Where'd you come up with that?</b>

<b>I'm Vila.</b>

<b>Oh, you are something.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>You'd make a great agent.</b>

<b>You should think about</b>

<b>getting your license.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Your real estate license.</b>

<b>We don't help you.</b>

<b>So I don't know what to say.</b>

<b>Say yes.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>All right.</b>

<b>Say you'll think about it.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Don't think about it.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>This is good.</b>

<b>This is really good.</b>

<b>[inaudible]</b>

<b>It's interesting.</b>

<b>Did you hear the question?</b>

<b>I think you're right.</b>

<b>[inaudible]</b>

<b>[inaudible]</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>A red light shows the couple</b>

<b>apartments only on the first</b>

<b>floor, so which of the following is true.</b>

<b>The rental agent is</b>

<b>protecting the other adults</b>

<b>from the disruption of the child's</b>

<b>running rate or her.</b>

<b>Now, when an inspection</b>

<b>goes wrong, what do you do?</b>

<b>Well, the contract all inspectors use</b>

<b>holds them harmless reliability.</b>

<b>Therefore, you don't have to do anything.</b>

<b>Excellent.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>[cheering]</b>

<b>[laughing]</b>

<b>[inaudible]</b>

<b>You haven't been looking for a place to</b>

<b>move to at all, have you?</b>

<b>I've been too busy.</b>

<b>Jack, I'm going to get</b>

<b>some listings tomorrow.</b>

<b>If you can't go see them, I will.</b>

<b>Fine.</b>

<b>Come on.</b>

<b>We're late.</b>

<b>You know how Bernie and Sandy hate that.</b>

<b>Please.</b>

<b>You look fantastic.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>What are you doing differently?</b>

<b>You had Botox or a peel?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>She's having an affair.</b>

<b>I'm not having an affair.</b>

<b>I'm having a life, plenty to ask.</b>

<b>That's not it.</b>

<b>There's something else going on.</b>

<b>What is it?</b>

<b>Jack and I are separating.</b>

<b>Oh my god.</b>

<b>You can't be serious.</b>

<b>We're not happy, and we</b>

<b>haven't been for a long time.</b>

<b>Well, nobody's happy.</b>

<b>What has that got to do with anything?</b>

<b>Kind of everything.</b>

<b>What about you and the cuttings?</b>

<b>There's hours away.</b>

<b>Guys, I got to tell you something.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Kate and I are splitting up.</b>

<b>You are the perfect couple.</b>

<b>Now looks are deceiving.</b>

<b>This is going to change our whole lives.</b>

<b>Sandy's not about you.</b>

<b>It's about us.</b>

<b>I love you guys.</b>

<b>I hope you don't take sides,</b>

<b>and we can all stay friends.</b>

<b>I don't get it.</b>

<b>What happened?</b>

<b>Just out of the blue of</b>

<b>the two, you just set it</b>

<b>at the same time to separate?</b>

<b>Poof.</b>

<b>I think Jack would</b>

<b>have been fine with things</b>

<b>staying the way they were.</b>

<b>I asked for the separation.</b>

<b>You OK?</b>

<b>Yeah, I'm fine.</b>

<b>If this one's not good, I'm</b>

<b>going to blow my own brains out.</b>

<b>Yeah, well, I'll put</b>

<b>my head next to yours,</b>

<b>make it two for one.</b>

<b>Are you sure you're the one that should</b>

<b>be finding Jack an apartment?</b>

<b>Well, if I don't, nobody will.</b>

<b>Kate?</b>

<b>Kate?</b>

<b>What's wrong?</b>

<b>Are the kids all right?</b>

<b>They're fine.</b>

<b>Well, then what am I doing</b>

<b>home in the middle of the day?</b>

<b>So I can take you to</b>

<b>see your new apartment.</b>

<b>And then we're going to tell the kids.</b>

<b>[music playing]</b>

<b>Andrew!</b>

<b>Yo!</b>

<b>Turn it down.</b>

<b>Yo, it's off.</b>

<b>Speak.</b>

<b>Time is precious.</b>

<b>Sometimes you're smarter than you know.</b>

<b>Sam, we need to have a talk.</b>

<b>I know all about the</b>

<b>birdies and the bees.</b>

<b>Remember, we have this</b>

<b>talk each and every year.</b>

<b>Oh my god, you're exhausting.</b>

<b>I know that too.</b>

<b>Mom, Dad, what?</b>

<b>Well, this is going to be</b>

<b>hard, so just get us a name, OK?</b>

<b>One minute, OK?</b>

<b>You know that your dad and I both love</b>

<b>you very much, right?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>And how in life sometimes things change.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Well, the problem is that we</b>

<b>don't love each other enough.</b>

<b>We're going to separate.</b>

<b>Did you hear what I just said?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>I've known for a long</b>

<b>time that things were bad.</b>

<b>I was just hoping for a miracle.</b>

<b>I know, sweetie, we were too.</b>

<b>I don't want to upset</b>

<b>your life or Adam's.</b>

<b>You both mean the world to us.</b>

<b>This is the last thing we wanted to do.</b>

<b>All I know is I want my</b>

<b>parents to stay together forever,</b>

<b>just like every other kid.</b>

<b>But Adam and I are also tired of hearing</b>

<b>you guys fight all the time.</b>

<b>I don't understand.</b>

<b>Why did you start fighting?</b>

<b>What happened?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>Why do people forget why they loved</b>

<b>each other in the first place?</b>

<b>Because even though we try to do the best</b>

<b>we can, we're human.</b>

<b>And sometimes we get stuck.</b>

<b>I just can't move.</b>

<b>I'm so sorry, sweetie.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Hey, sport.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Listen, your mom and I have something</b>

<b>pretty important to</b>

<b>talk to you about, so...</b>

<b>Can you put the Game Boy down?</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>You have all my numbers</b>

<b>that you need me, right?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Come here.</b>

<b>Come here a little bit.</b>

<b>I want you to listen to me.</b>

<b>Everything's going to be all right, OK?</b>

<b>I'm only five blocks away.</b>

<b>I see you all the time.</b>

<b>I'm sorry I'm late.</b>

<b>Why are you all standing there?</b>

<b>Why are you staring at me?</b>

<b>I'm fired, aren't I?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>I'm afraid I'm going to have</b>

<b>to fire you as our receptionist</b>

<b>because I'm hiring you</b>

<b>as a real estate agent.</b>

<b>You passed.</b>

<b>Maggie opened it.</b>

<b>I couldn't stand the system.</b>

<b>Oh, my god.</b>

<b>Well, congratulations, right?</b>

<b>That's just great.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>You.</b>

<b>Well, I'm a little excited</b>

<b>when I first opened the house.</b>

<b>Yeah, I don't get too excited.</b>

<b>I haven't seen it yet.</b>

<b>I'll find a pony in there somewhere.</b>

<b>I know you will.</b>

<b>I know you will.</b>

<b>Ta-da.</b>

<b>Oh, wow.</b>

<b>Nice, huh?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>OK, let's sell this house.</b>

<b>- OK. - Got your specs?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Cate.</b>

<b>They looked fine when you did them last</b>

<b>time, five minutes ago.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

<b>It's ridiculous.</b>

<b>I feel like I'm 15 years</b>

<b>old waiting for my first date.</b>

<b>Well, you'll get over that</b>

<b>as soon as the 100th loopy</b>

<b>locks through that door.</b>

<b>Go ahead.</b>

<b>You got to answer it. - Right.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Of course.</b>

<b>Hello. - Hey.</b>

<b>Hi, Bethan.</b>

<b>Come on in.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>Oh.</b>

<b>Oh, my.</b>

<b>This place hasn't been</b>

<b>touched in like 50 years.</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

<b>But I think that's a good thing.</b>

<b>No bad addition to contend with.</b>

<b>A clean pallet.</b>

<b>One owner.</b>

<b>Has anybody died here?</b>

<b>Well, yes.</b>

<b>But we all have to</b>

<b>die somewhere, don't we?</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Yeah, thanks.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Thanks for coming.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Bye.</b>

<b>Bye-bye.</b>

<b>Bye.</b>

<b>Do we have to tell them the bad things</b>

<b>when we show a house?</b>

<b>Yes, Kate.</b>

<b>Remember?</b>

<b>Disclosure?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Unless we're doing something wrong.</b>

<b>Little advice?</b>

<b>You want to hook them into the potential</b>

<b>before you tell them that</b>

<b>it's only had one owner.</b>

<b>That way, they're</b>

<b>slightly invested in the house</b>

<b>before they find out someone died there.</b>

<b>Great.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>Hang on.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>There you go.</b>

<b>That's fine.</b>

<b>What was your girlfriend's name?</b>

<b>Lauren?</b>

<b>When did she die?</b>

<b>Five years ago, May 30th.</b>

<b>Or didn't Big Mouth</b>

<b>Maggie tell you that part?</b>

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>It's none of my business.</b>

<b>No, it's OK.</b>

<b>But I'm sure it's still incredibly painful.</b>

<b>You know, you always think</b>

<b>that it will get less painful.</b>

<b>But the fact of the matter is it doesn't.</b>

<b>How long were you together?</b>

<b>Almost 10 years.</b>

<b>I mean, we'd known each other</b>

<b>for a long time before that.</b>

<b>But I wasn't ready to acknowledge it.</b>

<b>And she waited and waited.</b>

<b>I just wish she had been with me for a long time.</b>

<b>I just wish that I</b>

<b>hadn't wasted so much time</b>

<b>we didn't end up having.</b>

<b>But I think you were lucky to have the</b>

<b>time you did with her.</b>

<b>She was lucky to have it with you.</b>

<b>OK, shall we?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Hi, Sandy.</b>

<b>Rita.</b>

<b>How are you?</b>

<b>Fine.</b>

<b>Good.</b>

<b>How are you?</b>

<b>I'm OK.</b>

<b>This is McNally Hayes, Sandy, Rita.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

<b>We're late.</b>

<b>Have a nice lunch.</b>

<b>Oh, hi.</b>

<b>I didn't know whether or</b>

<b>not I should use my key.</b>

<b>No, you can use the key.</b>

<b>Oh, OK.</b>

<b>So, got the TV all hooked</b>

<b>up, plenty of junk food.</b>

<b>It'll be just like home.</b>

<b>Hey, give me a kiss.</b>

<b>You too.</b>

<b>[kiss]</b>

<b>See ya.</b>

<b>[crying]</b>

<b>[crying]</b>

<b>[crying]</b>

<b>Kate, what are you doing here?</b>

<b>Well, I was alone in my</b>

<b>house for the first time</b>

<b>in my entire life.</b>

<b>I had no kids.</b>

<b>I had no husband.</b>

<b>I have no friends.</b>

<b>So I came here.</b>

<b>Come on in.</b>

<b>This is Bob.</b>

<b>Hi, Bob.</b>

<b>What's the matter with you, huh?</b>

<b>You ever seen anybody fall apart before?</b>

<b>Bob, what are the rules, huh? Bob, think you know 'em. [crying] My kids left to spend the</b>

<b>night with Jack for the first time.</b>

<b>And I just came undone.</b>

<b>I've never not been with my kids.</b>

<b>You know, it's funny.</b>

<b>I gave up on my kids.</b>

<b>I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I gave up on myself so</b>

<b>long ago to be Jack's wife,</b>

<b>or be Sam's mother, Adam's</b>

<b>mother, to be a homemaker.</b>

<b>I was like a stepford wife.</b>

<b>But I wanted this.</b>

<b>I wanted things to change.</b>

<b>And now, I don't know.</b>

<b>I don't know anything.</b>

<b>Do you want them back?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I don't.</b>

<b>But this has torn my kids' lives apart.</b>

<b>And that's the hardest part of it.</b>

<b>It's overwhelming.</b>

<b>Yeah, of course it is.</b>

<b>I wanted more.</b>

<b>I wanted more from my life.</b>

<b>I wanted more from myself.</b>

<b>And I wanted more from Jack.</b>

<b>But she couldn't or</b>

<b>didn't want to give me.</b>

<b>Maybe he didn't know how to.</b>

<b>I think maybe it was me.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Something in me provoked him.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>I don't know anything anymore.</b>

<b>You know what?</b>

<b>This is not all your fault.</b>

<b>Really, it's not.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>You made the right decision.</b>

<b>And you're going to be fine.</b>

<b>OK?</b>

<b>You're going to be fine.</b>

<b>OK, don't--</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>Because you don't know what you're doing.</b>

<b>You don't know what this means.</b>

<b>Yes, I do.</b>

<b>It's what I feel.</b>

<b>It's a little more complicated than that.</b>

<b>You're straight, and this is wrong.</b>

<b>And you're just</b>

<b>responding to a little kindness,</b>

<b>to a little attention.</b>

<b>That's all.</b>

<b>You just don't have a clue.</b>

<b>It's not what I'm responding to.</b>

<b>I'm not some stupid teenager man.</b>

<b>Kate, I'm gay, and I know what it means.</b>

<b>This is my life, not some</b>

<b>abstract thought or feeling.</b>

<b>It isn't a switch I</b>

<b>get to turn on and off,</b>

<b>and it's not to be taken lightly.</b>

<b>I don't take this lightly.</b>

<b>In most of my life, I lived a lie,</b>

<b>trying to be my mother's daughter,</b>

<b>not acknowledging the fact that I was gay</b>

<b>because I was so scared</b>

<b>of the hate and the shame</b>

<b>until I met Lauren.</b>

<b>And she taught me how not to be afraid.</b>

<b>But this, it scares the hell out of me.</b>

<b>And I don't want to be scared anymore.</b>

<b>And I'm not the one to take another</b>

<b>person on that journey</b>

<b>because the first trip almost killed me.</b>

<b>I didn't mean to put</b>

<b>you in that position.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>It wasn't my intention.</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

<b>I don't know what this means.</b>

<b>I've never done this before.</b>

<b>But you should know I was</b>

<b>not looking for a quick fix</b>

<b>to my problems or the</b>

<b>touch of another human being,</b>

<b>whoever it was.</b>

<b>Believe it or not,</b>

<b>everything changed for me</b>

<b>the minute I met you.</b>

<b>It scares the hell out of me, too.</b>

<b>I should leave. [phone ringing]</b>

<b>[phone ringing]</b>

<b>Hey, Israel T.</b>

<b>This is Mrs. Wilson.</b>

<b>Let me try herself.</b>

<b>The person you are trying</b>

<b>to reach is out of range.</b>

<b>I'm sorry she's out of range.</b>

<b>Can I take a message?</b>

<b>If you ever hear me call back.</b>

<b>I'll tell you a call of Mrs. Wilson.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Bye-bye.</b>

<b>Where is she?</b>

<b>She hasn't been in</b>

<b>the office in two days.</b>

<b>I'm going out for a smoke.</b>

<b>Brad, you think you could answer the</b>

<b>phones just this once?</b>

<b>I don't think so.</b>

<b>It gets really scary.</b>

<b>You let it go to voicemail.</b>

<b>[phone ringing]</b>

<b>Maggie, what's going on?</b>

<b>Where's Mac?</b>

<b>Honey, I've known Mac.</b>

<b>It seems longer than I've known myself.</b>

<b>And where she is is in the dumper.</b>

<b>Screwed.</b>

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

<b>I've only seen her</b>

<b>come unglued three times.</b>

<b>When she met Lauren,</b>

<b>when she lost Lauren,</b>

<b>and when she met you.</b>

<b>[knocking]</b>

<b>Are you avoiding me?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>We haven't been in</b>

<b>the office in two days.</b>

<b>I've been working.</b>

<b>I get that, except you</b>

<b>haven't not come into the office</b>

<b>ever before, if I'm not mistaken, which I'm not.</b>

<b>I don't think there's</b>

<b>a real sense, is it?</b>

<b>Who cares?</b>

<b>Aren't you going to ask me in?</b>

<b>OK.</b>

<b>Do you want to come in?</b>

<b>Well, if this is what it's like being</b>

<b>attracted to someone</b>

<b>of the same sex, it</b>

<b>doesn't feel too good.</b>

<b>You're right about that.</b>

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

<b>Being shunned?</b>

<b>You're shunning me.</b>

<b>No, I'm not.</b>

<b>And you know, this isn't just about you.</b>

<b>That's about me, too.</b>

<b>Well, the least you could do is be an</b>

<b>adult and speak to me.</b>

<b>I'm sick of more dialogue from a woman.</b>

<b>What happened the other night shouldn't</b>

<b>impact our friendship.</b>

<b>We can still be friends, can't we?</b>

<b>I don't know how to be</b>

<b>your friend now, after that.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>Because I feel more for you</b>

<b>than a friend should feel.</b>

<b>So why don't we just</b>

<b>stop speaking to each other,</b>

<b>and I should quit working</b>

<b>for you and just disappear</b>

<b>because it's easier?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>Why is this so simple for me?</b>

<b>Why is this so simple for you?</b>

<b>It's not.</b>

<b>That's the part you're not getting.</b>

<b>Look, I have a big life</b>

<b>with lots of people in it,</b>

<b>and I was prepared to see what my</b>

<b>feelings were about,</b>

<b>knowing the risks involved,</b>

<b>not knowing if it was real.</b>

<b>I understand if you can't.</b>

<b>But I don't understand that you don't</b>

<b>want to talk to me or see me.</b>

<b>Don't you know that's all I want to do?</b>

<b>It's to see you, it's to talk to you.</b>

<b>Final translation</b>

<b>Never could I love like this before</b>

<b>'Cause it feels so much more</b>

<b>Than my heart ever knew</b>

<b>Never will I have to search again</b>

<b>For a shelter from the rain</b>

<b>You gave me a brand new start</b>

<b>And I found the missing part in you</b>

<b>Jack. Hi.</b>

<b>Come in. Kids aren't here, remember?</b>

<b>Yeah, I know. I want to</b>

<b>talk to you for a minute.</b>

<b>Sure. I'll have to leave</b>

<b>in a second, but come in.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>You look very nice. Thank you.</b>

<b>Where are you going?</b>

<b>Dinner with Matt and some clients. What</b>

<b>do you want to talk about?</b>

<b>Well, I got the divorce papers.</b>

<b>I'm absolutely positive about this.</b>

<b>Yeah, I am. I'm sorry, Jack.</b>

<b>Hi. Hi.</b>

<b>Hey, Jack. How are you?</b>

<b>Nice to see you again.</b>

<b>Yes, nice to see you.</b>

<b>Well, I hope you have a</b>

<b>successful dinner with your clients.</b>

<b>Goodbye.</b>

<b>Goodbye.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>That's a great</b>

<b>outfit. Where'd you get it?</b>

<b>You know, I never thought I'd say that to</b>

<b>someone I was dating.</b>

<b>Dinner with clients, huh?</b>

<b>What was I going to say that</b>

<b>I was going to date with you?</b>

<b>You know by the look on his face at the</b>

<b>wheel, it's starting</b>

<b>to turn already, right?</b>

<b>So if he hasn't</b>

<b>figured it out, he will soon.</b>

<b>I'm going to tell him.</b>

<b>Just not now.</b>

<b>When?</b>

<b>When your shirt isn't just a face?</b>

<b>It's not fair.</b>

<b>Sure it is. I mean, I don't know. Maybe</b>

<b>you're just trying it out like a car.</b>

<b>That's insulting and ridiculous.</b>

<b>Okay, I've seen it</b>

<b>happen a million times before.</b>

<b>Really? A million?</b>

<b>Don't be stupid. You know what I meant.</b>

<b>Actually, I don't know what you mean</b>

<b>because, you know, I'm new to the secret</b>

<b>club of yours with your</b>

<b>secret little handshakes.</b>

<b>We have to stop this. We</b>

<b>have to be careful now.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>Isn't that one of the</b>

<b>perks of being with a woman?</b>

<b>You talk and talk and talk about</b>

<b>everything until you go insane.</b>

<b>If you're trying to pick a fight with me</b>

<b>because you're scared about what's</b>

<b>happening, instead of just saying how</b>

<b>terrified you are,</b>

<b>consider yourself successful.</b>

<b>It's just everyone</b>

<b>expected coming from you.</b>

<b>Let's go out, Pat.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Get up.</b>

<b>Okay, I'm out back. Now what?</b>

<b>You're in there moping around like a sad</b>

<b>sack. What did you think would happen?</b>

<b>You plunge into your first post-Lauren</b>

<b>relationship with a straight, confused</b>

<b>mother of two. You</b>

<b>should give her some time.</b>

<b>What I should have done was to have stuck</b>

<b>to my life plan, which was to never, ever</b>

<b>get involved with anyone again.</b>

<b>There's a problem with that.</b>

<b>I think I'm in love with her.</b>

<b>I just want to say, I'm sorry. I</b>

<b>pressured you and I just forgot for a</b>

<b>moment what you were going through</b>

<b>because it hasn't been so</b>

<b>long since I've been through it.</b>

<b>And I did it without kids, so if you</b>

<b>can't do this, I understand.</b>

<b>I just want you to know that no matter</b>

<b>what happens, you'll always have a job.</b>

<b>You'll always have me as a friend.</b>

<b>Hi, we didn't have to</b>

<b>ring our own doorbell.</b>

<b>See you on Saturday.</b>

<b>How's it going?</b>

<b>Not great. They hate my place. They'd</b>

<b>rather be in their own</b>

<b>rooms. I can't blame them.</b>

<b>Why don't I come over some time and try</b>

<b>and help you make it more of a home?</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

<b>Bye-bye. I have to tell you something.</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

<b>Go ahead, sweetie.</b>

<b>As grown up as I</b>

<b>pretend to be, I'm really not.</b>

<b>One minute I understand it, and then the</b>

<b>next minute I don't.</b>

<b>I'm really not okay that</b>

<b>we're not a family anymore.</b>

<b>But we are still a family. Fractured,</b>

<b>yes, but a family nonetheless.</b>

<b>It's not the same.</b>

<b>And the thing is, I guess I thought life</b>

<b>would always be the same.</b>

<b>Things would never change, which is</b>

<b>stupid, because everything changes.</b>

<b>But I never thought the first person to</b>

<b>move out of the house would be Dad.</b>

<b>Sandy, this is a surprise.</b>

<b>Can I come in so I don't have to stand on</b>

<b>here groveling in front of the neighbors?</b>

<b>Sure. Come on in.</b>

<b>I just came over to apologize.</b>

<b>I guess I didn't want you to shake things</b>

<b>up, because then that just means I'd have</b>

<b>to take a look at my life</b>

<b>and see how crappy it is.</b>

<b>I get it. But I'm</b>

<b>really glad you came over.</b>

<b>Me too.</b>

<b>Do you love your job?</b>

<b>I do.</b>

<b>Are you going to start dating again soon?</b>

<b>Oh, God, what a terrible fog.</b>

<b>Well, you know, it's</b>

<b>funny you should mention that.</b>

<b>I'm going to tell you something, because</b>

<b>even though you're a snob, I think you're</b>

<b>an open-minded snob.</b>

<b>And I think I am attracted to someone.</b>

<b>Who?</b>

<b>The woman I work for.</b>

<b>You're joking.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I don't believe you.</b>

<b>Oh, why would you be so</b>

<b>shocked? Your sister's gay.</b>

<b>Because I don't approve of her lifestyle.</b>

<b>Since when did you become a bigot?</b>

<b>I'm not a bigot.</b>

<b>Must be tiring to sit in</b>

<b>judgment of everyone, Sandy.</b>

<b>Jack?</b>

<b>Dad?</b>

<b>Hey, hey, I'm in the kitchen.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

<b>Oh, my God.</b>

<b>I'm impressed.</b>

<b>Yeah, I made enough if you want to stay.</b>

<b>Sure, sure. That'd be nice.</b>

<b>Great.</b>

<b>You know, Dad, if it isn't any good, we</b>

<b>could always hire a</b>

<b>cook or a maid who cooks.</b>

<b>Yes, I realize that, but I am trying to</b>

<b>spend more quality time with</b>

<b>my children, if you don't mind.</b>

<b>If you don't mind, it's just you think</b>

<b>poisoning your kids is the</b>

<b>best way to bond with them?</b>

<b>Same.</b>

<b>So?</b>

<b>Not bad.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>I was very impressed, Jack.</b>

<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Can I go over to Betsy's?</b>

<b>Yes. After you do the dishes.</b>

<b>That's okay, honey. I'll do them.</b>

<b>You see how shallow</b>

<b>their love for me really is?</b>

<b>Can I go to Peter's?</b>

<b>What is wrong with you guys?</b>

<b>You have your mother and father in the</b>

<b>same place, together</b>

<b>again, and you want to leave.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>Go. Get out of here.</b>

<b>I, I, I, I, kiss, kiss.</b>

<b>My home. I'm good, Tom.</b>

<b>See ya.</b>

<b>See ya. Bye, Dad.</b>

<b>Bye-bye.</b>

<b>Well, it's good to know</b>

<b>something's never changed.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>You know, I, I could do some stuff in the</b>

<b>living room, if you like,</b>

<b>to help make things better.</b>

<b>Yeah, that'd, uh, be great.</b>

<b>See ya. It looks a little better, huh?</b>

<b>Maybe, maybe there's some curtains, you</b>

<b>know, and, uh, little</b>

<b>black and white photos.</b>

<b>Stuff.</b>

<b>Yeah. Definitely looks better.</b>

<b>Jack, we need to talk.</b>

<b>Yeah. The rule is you can only say that</b>

<b>once in a lifetime to the same person.</b>

<b>That's it.</b>

<b>I need to tell you something so you don't</b>

<b>find out another way.</b>

<b>Uh, what are you talking about?</b>

<b>I'm attracted to</b>

<b>someone and I'm pursuing it.</b>

<b>Who is he?</b>

<b>It's not a he, it's Mac.</b>

<b>Mac? Who's...</b>

<b>Maybe Mac, your boss?</b>

<b>What, if Mac's a woman, what is...</b>

<b>You can't be attracted to a woman.</b>

<b>She's a person, Jack.</b>

<b>What are you talking</b>

<b>about? She's a woman.</b>

<b>I don't understand this.</b>

<b>What are you telling me here?</b>

<b>That our whole life</b>

<b>together was this big lie?</b>

<b>No, that's not true.</b>

<b>Well, then explain something to me. How</b>

<b>can you suddenly be attracted to a woman?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>I wasn't even looking for any kind of</b>

<b>relationship and</b>

<b>certainly not one with a woman.</b>

<b>Wait a second, wait a second, wait a</b>

<b>second, wait a second.</b>

<b>Is this the problem? Is this the problem?</b>

<b>All along, deep down inside, you had</b>

<b>these feelings, you felt this way, and</b>

<b>that's why our marriage failed?</b>

<b>No, the failure of our</b>

<b>marriage is both our faults.</b>

<b>It's nothing to do with Mac or any other</b>

<b>woman. I've never had feelings for</b>

<b>another woman in my life,</b>

<b>Jack, and I met Mac after we split.</b>

<b>I can't believe this.</b>

<b>You don't have to. It's not about you.</b>

<b>No, really, really, it's</b>

<b>not about me. That's great.</b>

<b>Okay, let me put it another way.</b>

<b>It's my life and I can live it any way I</b>

<b>want. It doesn't concern you.</b>

<b>Okay. But it does concern my children,</b>

<b>and I will not have them around this.</b>

<b>What does that mean?</b>

<b>It means that you have put them through</b>

<b>enough, and you are not</b>

<b>going to do this to them too.</b>

<b>Monday morning, I am</b>

<b>filing papers for sole custody.</b>

<b>Hey, what's wrong?</b>

<b>I told Jack about us. Mainly because</b>

<b>Sammy came by to apologize, and like an</b>

<b>idiot, I thought I could share something</b>

<b>with my best friend who has a gay sister.</b>

<b>Instead, she's the moral</b>

<b>majority. I'm an idiot.</b>

<b>Yeah, bigotry is stunning, isn't it?</b>

<b>Afraid that's not the end of it. Jack</b>

<b>wants to take the kids away from me.</b>

<b>He's just scared. He</b>

<b>doesn't really mean it.</b>

<b>Tell that to the court he's</b>

<b>filing papers with Monday.</b>

<b>Oh, God. I don't know what to do. I don't</b>

<b>want to tell the kids. I feel like</b>

<b>they've been through enough already, but</b>

<b>I'm afraid if I don't, he will.</b>

<b>And I don't want him to</b>

<b>drag you into court either.</b>

<b>Don't worry about me.</b>

<b>I think I have to tell him</b>

<b>before he does. Are you sure?</b>

<b>I don't think I have a</b>

<b>choice. He's forced my hand.</b>

<b>Maybe you should wait.</b>

<b>Well, I have to tell Sam</b>

<b>at least before he does.</b>

<b>Listen, I'm sorry for the saying yes,</b>

<b>saying no, saying yes thing.</b>

<b>Please have faith in me.</b>

<b>I know I sound like a broken record, but</b>

<b>are you sure about this? About us?</b>

<b>I don't know if this is going to last</b>

<b>forever, but the night that we fought and</b>

<b>you left, it was as if</b>

<b>someone pulled my heart out.</b>

<b>And when you came back, you brought my</b>

<b>heart with you. So right</b>

<b>here, right now, yeah, I'm sure.</b>

<b>There are some real consequences, which</b>

<b>you've just encountered. Are</b>

<b>you prepared for more of that?</b>

<b>No. Kate, I don't want you to</b>

<b>lose your kids because of me.</b>

<b>I don't want to lose my kids either.</b>

<b>The truth is, maybe I'm not prepared for</b>

<b>any of this, but I made an adult</b>

<b>conscious choice to be with you. Not a</b>

<b>man, not a woman, but you.</b>

<b>I am prepared to stand by my</b>

<b>heart, which I've given to you.</b>

<b>As complex as it might</b>

<b>be. This much, I know.</b>

<b>Hey, Bob.</b>

<b>Hey, Joe.</b>

<b>Why'd you pull me out of a play date?</b>

<b>I was kidding. What's</b>

<b>happened? Is it Dad? Adam?</b>

<b>No, honey. Everyone's fine.</b>

<b>Then what?</b>

<b>I need to tell you something that's going</b>

<b>to be very difficult.</b>

<b>On a scale of one to ten, with ten being</b>

<b>a divorce, what would it be?</b>

<b>Two, Sam.</b>

<b>Six?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>Okay, just tell me.</b>

<b>It's hard to put into words.</b>

<b>I'm not going to guess.</b>

<b>Well, you know how your teacher, Mr.</b>

<b>Jackson, lives with a man, and I've</b>

<b>always told you you could</b>

<b>love or be with anybody.</b>

<b>Yeah?</b>

<b>Well, you know Mac,</b>

<b>the woman I work with.</b>

<b>Yeah, she's a lesbian. So?</b>

<b>How did you know that?</b>

<b>I'm not dumb.</b>

<b>But how could you know? She</b>

<b>doesn't even look like one.</b>

<b>No, she doesn't look like one. Look, Mom,</b>

<b>could you please tell me why you dragged</b>

<b>me out of Betsy's house?</b>

<b>I... I really... I</b>

<b>don't know how to start.</b>

<b>Mom, just start somewhere.</b>

<b>Well, Mac and I have become very good</b>

<b>friends, as you know.</b>

<b>And I know this is going to sound</b>

<b>strange, but I'm attracted to her.</b>

<b>Okay. I don't</b>

<b>understand. What do you mean?</b>

<b>I'm attracted to Mac like I used to be</b>

<b>attracted to your father.</b>

<b>You mean in a sexual way?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>That would make you</b>

<b>gay and you're not gay.</b>

<b>No, I'm not. I mean, I wasn't. But if I</b>

<b>want to be with Mac, I guess I am.</b>

<b>You've only known her for a few months. I</b>

<b>mean, I don't understand.</b>

<b>Did you like girls before?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Well, you said people were born that way.</b>

<b>Well, I don't look at Mac as a woman. I</b>

<b>look at her as a person.</b>

<b>I... I don't understand. And you weren't</b>

<b>born gay. But now you are. And...</b>

<b>You're with a woman? I don't get it.</b>

<b>I know. I... I don't know what happened.</b>

<b>I don't know what it means. Does this</b>

<b>mean I'm gay forever now?</b>

<b>I... I don't know, Sam. I know this is a</b>

<b>shock to you. It's a</b>

<b>shock to me too, but...</b>

<b>I told your father and he's really upset.</b>

<b>Gee, I wonder why.</b>

<b>Don't let the nose ring and</b>

<b>the purple streak fool you.</b>

<b>I'm upset too.</b>

<b>Honey, I care immensely for Mac. And the</b>

<b>only reason I'm telling you all this is</b>

<b>because your father was</b>

<b>to take you away from me.</b>

<b>Now, maybe he's just angry. Maybe not.</b>

<b>But I'm telling you because I love you.</b>

<b>And I don't want to lose you.</b>

<b>You know what? I don't really want to</b>

<b>talk about it anymore.</b>

<b>I raised you to have an open mind.</b>

<b>Please, honey, can't</b>

<b>we just talk about this?</b>

<b>No. No. We're done talking.</b>

<b>I know that's a very good idea.</b>

<b>Jack is angry enough to try to get</b>

<b>everyone on his side to get custody,</b>

<b>including my dear old mother, who, by the</b>

<b>way, is rich enough to buy the court.</b>

<b>Even Bob doesn't think it's a good idea.</b>

<b>I'm just hoping that blood is thicker</b>

<b>than I've been lit to believe.</b>

<b>Don't count on it.</b>

<b>Hey, Katie. Is your mother expecting you?</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>You know how she hates surprises.</b>

<b>Yeah, well, she's going to love tonight.</b>

<b>She's in the bath now, but</b>

<b>she'll be down soon. What is it?</b>

<b>I'm going to try this out on you first.</b>

<b>Ten seconds left. Brad,</b>

<b>sorry. I... Come on in.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>Okay. Stand there.</b>

<b>I just came by to tell you that I think</b>

<b>Lauren would've really liked Kate.</b>

<b>Okay, Katie, what's going on?</b>

<b>Well, I've met someone, romantically.</b>

<b>Well, if you're happy, I'm happy. You</b>

<b>know I'm not speaking for your mother.</b>

<b>But I don't know why you're</b>

<b>making such a big fuss over it.</b>

<b>Well, the thing is, the person that I met</b>

<b>and I'm involved with,</b>

<b>romantically, is a woman.</b>

<b>What? You don't have anything to say?</b>

<b>I'm thinking about it.</b>

<b>I haven't seen you this happy since you</b>

<b>got that swing out back when you were 12.</b>

<b>So it's okay with me.</b>

<b>May I make a suggestion?</b>

<b>Sure.</b>

<b>I'd get out of this house</b>

<b>before your mother comes down.</b>

<b>Who wouldn't take Walt Geddy's name when</b>

<b>you're talking to, Mary?</b>

<b>I know it's too late for your soap opera.</b>

<b>No, it's not.</b>

<b>Well, Bellwell, an unannounced visitor.</b>

<b>You know how I love that.</b>

<b>I know you do, Mother.</b>

<b>That's too much, Mary.</b>

<b>No. Trust me, it's not.</b>

<b>Well, what is it?</b>

<b>I hope you haven't come over here to ask</b>

<b>me to babysit for your children now that</b>

<b>you're a single mother with a job.</b>

<b>God, that was hard to say.</b>

<b>You know, Mother, I think they'd sooner</b>

<b>have their eyes gouged out.</b>

<b>You know what your problem</b>

<b>is, what it's always been?</b>

<b>No, but I'm sure you're going to tell me.</b>

<b>You're a smartass. Always have been.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Just spit it out.</b>

<b>Well, I've met someone, and</b>

<b>I'm seeing them romantically.</b>

<b>Well, that was a little</b>

<b>fast, don't you think?</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>

<b>And it's a woman.</b>

<b>Mary, you don't need to hear this.</b>

<b>I won't have it.</b>

<b>Do you hear me?</b>

<b>It's really not up to you, Mother.</b>

<b>It's against God.</b>

<b>You'll burn in hell for it.</b>

<b>Well, then I'll burn in hell for it.</b>

<b>It's not natural,</b>

<b>don't you understand that?</b>

<b>To care about another human being who is</b>

<b>spectacular is natural.</b>

<b>I've finally come back to life.</b>

<b>Mother, I've waited years for someone</b>

<b>like Mack to come along.</b>

<b>What kind of a name is that for a woman?</b>

<b>Is that a lesbian nickname of some sort?</b>

<b>No, it's not.</b>

<b>I did not raise my</b>

<b>daughter to be a lesbian.</b>

<b>This is not about you.</b>

<b>I won't have it. You'll</b>

<b>stop seeing her right now.</b>

<b>I'm an adult now, much</b>

<b>to your astonishment.</b>

<b>You can't boss me around anymore.</b>

<b>But you can stop seeing</b>

<b>me, which I hope you won't.</b>

<b>Because in spite of all of</b>

<b>our problems, you're my mother.</b>

<b>And I love you.</b>

<b>And I'm your only child.</b>

<b>So I hope once the shock wears off,</b>

<b>you'll try to open your</b>

<b>mind to this and accept it.</b>

<b>There's one thing you can count on.</b>

<b>That day will never come.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>Sorry. It didn't go well</b>

<b>with your mother, did it?</b>

<b>No, it did not.</b>

<b>What happened?</b>

<b>She pretty much did the</b>

<b>biblical thing and disowned me.</b>

<b>I didn't have to give her time. My mother</b>

<b>did the same thing and</b>

<b>now we couldn't be closer.</b>

<b>First of all, your mother</b>

<b>and my mother are not the same.</b>

<b>We've never been close. And she doesn't need time because she's</b>

<b>going to feel this way forever.</b>

<b>So in addition to not having a mother, I</b>

<b>have a daughter who's processing it.</b>

<b>A son who doesn't know.</b>

<b>An ex-best friend who's all of a sudden</b>

<b>is related to Jerry Falwell.</b>

<b>Husband who wants to take my kids away.</b>

<b>So all in all, I'd say this coming out</b>

<b>thing's been a big hit.</b>

<b>I did try to warn you that</b>

<b>it could get really messy.</b>

<b>I did not get this messy if I did.</b>

<b>What?</b>

<b>You wouldn't have done it or you wouldn't</b>

<b>have had feelings for me?</b>

<b>Or you wouldn't have</b>

<b>gone through with it?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>Then I should leave.</b>

<b>No, no, no.</b>

<b>Then what do you want me to do?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

<b>Because I can't sit here and let you lose</b>

<b>everything because of me.</b>

<b>One minute I think I can handle it and</b>

<b>the next I'm sure I can't.</b>

<b>Then I think of you and I know I'm</b>

<b>completely out of my mind.</b>

<b>[Music]</b>

<b>Jack.</b>

<b>Kate.</b>

<b>I'll go.</b>

<b>No, no, it's fine.</b>

<b>It concerns both of you.</b>

<b>Mary called me and she</b>

<b>told me how Dorothy reacted.</b>

<b>Which was pretty much how I reacted.</b>

<b>And I don't want to be like your mother.</b>

<b>You know, I don't want</b>

<b>to be small and petty.</b>

<b>But I do want to be small and petty, but</b>

<b>Sam says that's a really bad thing to be.</b>

<b>She's a kid and somehow, I</b>

<b>don't know how she knows that.</b>

<b>She also forced me to come down here,</b>

<b>which I really did not want to do.</b>

<b>My instinct was to hurt you.</b>

<b>The way you hurt me.</b>

<b>But see, I don't want to do that either.</b>

<b>I don't want to take</b>

<b>the kids away from you.</b>

<b>I don't understand what you're doing.</b>

<b>Maybe I never will.</b>

<b>Maybe I would have known how to compete</b>

<b>with another guy, but I have no idea how</b>

<b>to compete with a woman.</b>

<b>Very confused.</b>

<b>But what I loved about you when we met,</b>

<b>I still love about you.</b>

<b>I want you to be happy.</b>

<b>And I want to be happy too, so...</b>

<b>I'm going to try and do better.</b>

<b>That's all I wanted to say.</b>

<b>(Music)</b>

<b>Hey, beautiful.</b>

<b>Hi, Mary.</b>

<b>Would you consider us living together</b>

<b>someday in the faraway future?</b>

<b>Not the reaction I was hoping for.</b>

<b>Oh, you need to slow down.</b>

<b>I just jumped through some huge hoops.</b>

<b>I'm too tired right now to even think</b>

<b>about jumping through another one.</b>

<b>And as you're saying</b>

<b>goes, "Love me, love my dog."</b>

<b>Mine is, "Love me, love my two kids."</b>

<b>And they're not nearly</b>

<b>as well trained as Bob is.</b>

<b>Hey, are you prepared for that?</b>

<b>An instant family?</b>

<b>One of whom doesn't even know about us?</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>Well, I'm going to have to catch my</b>

<b>breath. That's a big leap.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Just a breath.</b>

<b>Since when do you care if</b>

<b>your grandma comes to anything?</b>

<b>I don't. I'm doing this for Mom.</b>

<b>Don't get up.</b>

<b>(Music)</b>

<b>If you've come here to lecture me, you</b>

<b>know where the door is.</b>

<b>We didn't come here to lecture you.</b>

<b>I came here to invite</b>

<b>you to my graduation.</b>

<b>Isn't that sweet?</b>

<b>And I'm sure your mother and</b>

<b>that woman will be there too.</b>

<b>I'm sorry, Samantha, but</b>

<b>I won't be where they are.</b>

<b>First of all, that woman</b>

<b>has a name. It's McNally.</b>

<b>And second of all, this</b>

<b>isn't about you. It's about me.</b>

<b>This is my graduation.</b>

<b>And if you don't come, you don't have a</b>

<b>daughter or a granddaughter.</b>

<b>It's so much easier, Dorothy, to remember</b>

<b>why you love someone</b>

<b>and to move past things,</b>

<b>even if you don't understand them.</b>

<b>You can just pretend to, like I'm doing.</b>

<b>Kate's a remarkable person.</b>

<b>She gave me that kid.</b>

<b>Even you have to admit.</b>

<b>That's some kid.</b>

<b>We present to you the</b>

<b>graduating class of 2002.</b>

<b>[Music]</b>

<b>I'm very proud of you, Sam, and I love</b>

<b>you very, very much.</b>

<b>Don't you dare make me cry. It took me</b>

<b>three hours to get my eyeliner on.</b>

<b>I'm really sorry it took</b>

<b>me so long to come around.</b>

<b>I know you didn't raise me that way.</b>

<b>Honey, what made you change your mind?</b>

<b>I realize that you're really happy now. I</b>

<b>mean, you haven't been for a long time.</b>

<b>That's it. Simple, huh?</b>

<b>You are a spectacular person.</b>

<b>You should stop pushing me. I'll get</b>

<b>there when I get there.</b>

<b>Yes, and we'll all be dead by then.</b>

<b>What do I call her? What do I call them?</b>

<b>They have names, Grandma. Start there.</b>

<b>See you about that. I'm glad you took</b>

<b>that thing out anyway.</b>

<b>You're a graduate. Why did you do this?</b>

<b>Isn't this a foreshadow?</b>

<b>-Is it? -No, it's permanent.</b>

<b>Now that the ceremony makes you a maid,</b>

<b>this is Mac. This is my mother Dorothy.</b>

<b>Hello, Dorothy. Nice to meet you.</b>

<b>-Hi. -Brad?</b>

<b>-How are you? -I'm good.</b>

<b>-First thing. -Yes.</b>

<b>-I'll work together. -Yes.</b>
