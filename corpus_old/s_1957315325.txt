Welcome, my little creeps,

to Grindhouse Ghoulia's Theatre of Terror.

Tonight, we're showing a spooky

little Halloween potboiler
called "Reunion Massacre".

It's about a young woman

who travels to her high school reunion,

only to be met by a masked madman

with an agenda on his mind.

Can she defeat the killer,

and earn the coveted status of final girl?

Watch and find out.

And join me after the shocking climax.

Stand in front of the
eye of Master Zaltar.

You must be very brave for what
lies ahead of you, my dear.

What will be onto you,

as you face a trauma from your past.

Be warned of a coward's deception.

Hello?

Hey mom, how's it going?

I'm fine,
how are you sweetheart?

Just hanging out.

Feeling kinda depressed.

Oh, I know
it's gonna take time.

I know.

And you did the right thing.

Thanks,

I know, you're right.

So, I got an invite in the mail.

An invitation, for what?

My high school reunion.

Gosh, it's
already been 10 years?

I guess so.

I'm not sure if I really wanna go, though.

Why not?

It could be just what you need

to brighten your spirits.

Yeah.

Showing up alone,

and telling everyone
that I've been a barmaid

and living paycheck to paycheck.

Sweetie, you
can leave all that out.

I just thought you might feel better

seeing some old friends is all.

I'll think about it.

I really think you should.

Okay, mom. Thanks for listening.

Talk to you later.

Love you.

Love you too dear, goodbye.

Be warned
of a coward's deception.

Hey.
Hey!

What are you doing here?

I just brought some
Halloween decorations.

I thought they'd cheer you up.

Well come on in.

So, you're gonna go?

I'm thinking about it.

Oh, you totally should.

I bet it would help get
your mind off things.

Gah, now you sound like my mother.

Well, it's a good idea.

You really should get out.

You're never going to meet a guy

cooped up in your own house.

I'm not sure if I'm ready
for another relationship yet.

Who said anything about a relationship?

Are we putting this stuff up or what?

Let's do it.

Looks awesome.

Thanks for stopping
by, I really needed this.

Yeah, you're my bestie.

Well, if you end up going to the reunion,

you should call me and
let me know how it was.

I totally will, thanks again.

Yeah. Hang in there though.

I probably should get
going to Michael's though.

I don't want to be late.

So, talk soon?

Bye.

Bye.

So much at stake,

all you can think of is your own feeling.

One woman has hurt you,

you'll take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

You're a coward and a weakling.

No, oh, Richard, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

If you don't help us,
we'll die in Casablanca.

What of it?

I'm gonna die in Casablanca,

it's a good spot for it.

Now if you--

All right, I tried to reason with you.

I tried everything. Now,
I want those letters.

Get them for me.

I don't have
to. I got them right here.

Put them on the table.

No.

For the last
time, put them on the table.

If Laszlo and the cause
mean so much to you,

you won't stop at anything.

All right, I'll make it easier for you.

Go ahead and shoot.

You'll be doing me a favor.

Richard.

I tried to stay away.

I thought I would never see you again.

That you were out of my life.

Hello?

Is anyone there?

Hello?

What the fuck is this?

I can't take it anymore.

You dumb bitch.

Oh shit.

Fuck!

This doesn't look right.

What?

It's you.

Who the fuck else did you think it was?

I guess I should have known it was you.

Why are you doing this to me?

Why won't you leave me alone?

Because you're mine.

You know the old saying.

If I can't have you, then nobody can.

You're fucking crazy.

Fucking crazy about you.

No, don't cry, I love you so much.

Don't cry.

I put up with a decade of your abuse.

Not anymore!

Hello?

Hey sweetie,
how are you doing today?

Um, slowly getting better.

A little on edge.

What did the doctor say?

She said I should try and
continue my normal routines

and time heals everything.

There's a lot of truth to that.

Just know that I'm here if you need me.

I know, thanks mom.

Did you decide if
you're doing anything tonight?

Halloween used to be your favorite.

Well, I don't know if I'm ready

to be around a bunch of people.

You know, they still
haven't found his body

or that other girl.

You know that
sheriff, blind as a bat.

He couldn't find himself in a mirror.

The bastard probably hauled
off to die somewhere.

And if the sheriff don't
find him, the coyotes will.

Mom!

God, I hope they find him.

I hope Kaia turns up too.

Kaia is a wild one.

Always was.

Don't worry too much.

Her and that boyfriend of hers

probably went on another one

of their last minute camping trips.

I'm sure you're right.

Regardless, it all still
makes me pretty nervous.

Maybe just
take it easy then tonight.

Find something fun to do around the house.

You could just hand out candy.

I suppose.

They're playing some
good movies on TV too,

So I'll probably just do that.

My car is still in the shop

so I'm pretty much stuck here anyway.

Okay. Well,
I'll stop pestering you.

Don't be afraid to call for anything.

Love you.

All right.

I love you too, Mom.

Goodbye.

Oh Johnny!

Help me, help!

I wonder what happened

to the one from last year.

Each year we spend good
money on these things.

Then come out here and the
one from last year is gone.

Well, the flowers die,

and the caretaker or
somebody takes them away.

Yeah a
little spit and polish

you can clean this up,
and sell it next year.

Wonder how many times
we bought the same one.

It was
from right over there.

I jumped out at you from behind the tree

and Grandpa got all excited

and he shook his fist at me,

and he said "boy, you'll be
damned to hell"

Remember that, right over there.

You use to really be scared here.

Johnny.

You're still afraid!

Stop it.

They're
coming to get you, Barbara.

They're coming for you, Barbara.

Stop it,
you're acting like a child.

They're coming for you.

Look,

there comes one of them now.

He'll hear you.

Here he comes now,

I'm getting out of here.

Johnny!

Night of total terror.

Kids.

Night

of the Living Dead.

Night of

total terror.

I mean, seriously, not funny.

You gotta be

fucking kidding me.

I told you nobody could have you.

Well, if that wasn't a downer,

then I don't know what is.

She got away the first time,

but that son of a bitch
just wouldn't stay down.

Brings a new meaning to
"'til death do us part".

If you ask me, she
could've done much better.

Never settle for less, kitties.

Anywho, that's all the
time they pay me for today.

Oops.

I mean uh,

that's all the time we have today.

Join me on the next installment

of "Grindhouse Goulia's Theatre of Terror"

from 42nd street films.

Pleasant screams.
