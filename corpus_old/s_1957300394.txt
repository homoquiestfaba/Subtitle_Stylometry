[wind swooshing]

[ominous music playing]

[car zooms]

[phone ringing]

[windshield wiper clacking]

I have to tell you something.

[phone ringing]

It's gonna come out
soon enough anyway.

[ringing continues]

I want you to hear it from me.

I made a mistake.


I wanted to do the right thing.

I don't know what to do.
I'm so... I'm sorry.

[somber music playing]

[keyboard clacking]

[cellphone ringing]

-Hello.
-Hey, when are you coming home?

You know, I'm not...
I'm not sure.

I... gotta get this stuff done
before tomorrow.

So, you're not out drinking
with your work friends?

I'm at work.


No.

Okay, please don't.

So, when are you coming home?

I don't know, um...
probably wouldn't wait up
for me though.

Sean, do you remember
that I'm ovulating?

Tonight?


Sean?

Well, I gotta get
this stuff done, so...

Okay.


Okay.

Okay, yes.

You know what, I'll...
I'll be home in 30 minutes.

Okay.

Love you.

Mm-hmm.

[Sean moans]


Okay.


What are you doing?

I'm trying to help
your boys out.


Karen said this is how
she and Steve got pregnant.

Right, right
and that's all this is.

Hey, where are you going?


I think I'm gonna head back in.

To work?

Yeah,
I got to get this stuff done.

So, you're just gonna screw me
and go?

[water running]

Seriously?


[birds chirping]

Which brings me
to social media, okay?
Watch what you post.

I don't want to see any red cups
or red eyes, alright?

If you're serious about landing
a position here
at the end of this internship,

you take this part serious.

The media would love to do
anything they can
to discredit us.

Excuse me.
Cole, sorry to interrupt,

but, uh, when you're done here,
will you see me in my office?


-Are these the new interns?
-[Cole] Yes, sir.

Ripe and ready
for the world of politics.

Wow! Welcome to the team.
It's great to have you aboard.

I want to thank you in advance
for all the hard work,

I'm sure Cole's gonna be
throwing your way
in the next few days.


We all know the deadline
is not going to help me at all

because I have to have this done within 30 days.

Right. Thank you.



So, that went south in a hurry.
How behind am I?

You're supposed to have
a phone call with
Councilman Campbell at 02:00.

-Excuse me, senator.
I just thought...
-This is Councilman Campbell.

...it'd be best if I came in
and met with you face-to-face.

-And you can call me Robert.
-Alright Robert, let's walk.

Uh, okay, well,
thank you for meeting me today.

I wanted to talk to you
about Isaac's open senate seat.

Like my strong record...

Robert,
you don't have a name yet.

You need a bill or a project
or something
to build your name up.

Well, I think that my experience
as councilman in...

How about this?

There's a renewable energy grant
I've been trying to land
for some time now,

but it seems dead in water.

It's a seed project
for wind energy
on the west side of the state.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember that.

that project through,

I'll make sure to bring
your name up to the rest
of the nominations committee.

But I'd like to sit down and
have a real discussion about...

Robert, I have to step
into this meeting.

The briefing on the project
will have all the information
you need to move forward.

Yeah, well.
Thank you, Bruce. Thank you.

[tranquil music playing]

[muffles indistinct chatter]

Hello, everyone.

Thank you all for inviting me
here today.

Thank you to the Ladies'
Auxiliary for the...

For the lovely decorations,
the fine food.

Uh...

-Hey.
-I need to share something
with you.

-Hi.
-I need to share something

that's difficult for me
to say...

I'm Ashlee.

Hey.

Usually people say
their name back,
maybe you should try it.

-That's cool.
-No, I'm sorry. I'm Javier.

Nice to meet you.

You too.

The future of this county is in
newer technology and innovation.

So, this... What are you doing
sulking back here in the corner?

Oh, uh, I work here, mostly with
the kids' program, but yeah.

And you don't approve
of this wind turbine project?

I mean, it's fine. I just...
I don't see how any of this has
to do with any of us, you know.

I mean, like,
why is this guy here?

To make himself look better?

Maybe he's here to help.

We don't need another
little project.

We need hands.

We need people to come here
and get their hands dirty.

And the construction
of these wind turbines will be
our ticket to that future.

Thank you again
for inviting me here tonight.

Now, let's have some
of that pie, huh?


[airplane swooshes]

[telephone ringing]

Sean.

Hey.

What's up?

Is everything alright?

No.


Oh, oh, it's gonna be alright.

Don't say that.



I called an adoption agency
on the way in.

A what?

I just wanted to try to figure
out what we can do next.

Uh, I mean, don't you think...

Don't you think maybe we should
talk about this a little?

Honey, we are talking about it.

I know,
but we haven't even considered
all the other options yet.


I don't know.


Damn it!

I so badly wanted this
to be your fault.


[somber music playing]

Hey.


â™ª You're flying too close
To the sun, son â™ª

â™ª Flying too close to the sun

â™ª Too high to know

â™ª You were safer below

â™ª Now your dreams are...

No way.

-Yes.
-[laughs]



[romantic music playing]

Hey, I know we said
no baby stuff tonight,

but, um,
I just wanted to apologize
about earlier, alright?

What you said,
it just caught me off guard

and I just didn't have time
to process it.

-[Nadia] It's okay.
-[Sean I know.

I know, um, I just want you
to be happy, alright?

And I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make this work.

-Okay?
-Yeah.



â™ª Protecting the wings
From the trouble it brings â™ª

â™ª For someday
We all have to die â™ª

â™ª Now we're flying so high
In the sky â™ª

[children talking inaudibly]

[birds chirping]

[car rumbling]

[overlapping chatter]

Hey.

Ashlee, right?

-[Javier]
We met at the banquet at...
-[Ashlee] Yeah.

-What are you doing here?
-I'm here to get my hands dirty.

Um, hey, I'm really sorry
for being late I...

-No, I ran into some traffic
and I didn't know who to call.
-No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.
I'm glad you got here safe.

Go ahead. Yeah.

I don't know, maybe I'll see you
sometime in September.


Okay, bye.

Damn it.

everyone is pregnant.

Hey, honey.
How much did you spend
on groceries this week?

I can't find the receipts
anywhere.


I think it was something
like 80 bucks.

Alright.

[somber music playing]

Honey.

-Honey.
-Yeah, what is it?

"We're excited to inform you
that your application
has been accepted

for an international adoption."

Sean!

What?

Let me see this. Unbelievable!

Look!

Hold... hold on, honey.
It says here that your first
down payment of $10,000

is due on or before August 31st
in order to proceed
with the process.

We don't have that kind
of cash on hand.

Honey, don't do this.

-Sean, we need this.
-Well, what do you want me
to do?

-How am I supposed...
-Figure it out.

-...to figure out $10,000.
-We made this decision together.


-Look, we agreed on this.
-I know. I want this too.

Really?

Because I honestly feel
like I'm the only one

that's really doing
anything about this.

-No...
-Sean, I'm 36 years old.

I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

-What? Oh, my God!
-Well,
I obviously try to help...

You're just walking away
from me?

Sean, this doesn't
make any sense.

[door closes]

[somber music playing]

[truck rumbling]

Um, so, I was thinking we could
use some of that same content

that you used
at GVSU last month.

-What, that connected?
-Absolutely.

Have you looked at Twitter?

Uh, look, I need you
to be on top of this, okay?

Yeah.

Wescott has to sign on
on this wind project.

Okay, well if you want,
I could run down
some of the other owners.

-If you want me to do that
I can...
-No, hold off on that.

Why?

Look, Wescott's already nervous
about coming in under budget
on this, so just leave it.

Okay. Well, if I need to reach
out to anybody just let me know.

It's fine. Look, I know...
I know the owner of the property
that's listed on the survey.

It's... it's... almost
done anyway.

We just...
We just need her signature,

so, I can go with them
to make sure we get that.

-Do you want me to organize
that? I can call the owner.
-No, Ashlee. Uh, look.

You're an intern, okay?
Just do what I tell you.

Really, you're doing a good job.

Thank you.

[eerie music playing]

Where's your son?

[foreign language]

Your son, El Nino or whatever.

I'm not leaving.

Is this it?

It's only 935 pounds.

It's supposed to be
a thousand pounds.
You're 65 pounds short.

No.

-1000.
-No, you're short again
and I just counted.

I'm supposed to pick up
a thousand, you're short again.

[foreign language]

[foreign language]

Listen to me.

You could just leave here
and I could just let it rot
and you would get nothing.

And I don't want that for you.

So, why don't we discuss
how to make up that 65 pounds?

[camera shutter clicks]



It's our only option.

Should we go introduce
ourselves?

No, no, no.
We have to draw the lease up.

We need a notary public.

And then have Sean come back.

We're just here
for these pictures.

Hey, when you send
those to Westcott,

make sure I'm CC'd
on the email, alright?

-Right.
-Come on, let's go.

[eerie music playing]

[somber music playing]

[birds squeaking]

[drawer thuds]

-Ashlee?
-Oh, hey.


I thought you would
have left by now.

No, yeah. I'm just, um,
catching up with some...

Uh, you know we can wait on that
until tomorrow.
I really need to lock up.

-So, we can just...
-Just one minute.

Um, is this... Is this the wind
committee advisory's report?

Ashlee, you really need to go.
I need to...

I need something to take home
to work on tonight
and this would be great.


Yeah, this is, uh,
this is the brief
from Senator Peterson's office.

-That's... That's the
recommended area right there.
-Okay.

So, any of these five farms
could have worked
for the wind turbines?

Yeah, yeah. Any of those five.

Great.
Um, hey, do you mind if I make
a copy of this really quickly?

Yeah, go ahead.

Thank you.

See you outside.

[car passing by]

I... I thought it was brilliant.

Now, Karen, Karen could hardly
keep her eyes open.


Oh, God! Oh, excuse me.

-Could we get
another round here?
-Sure thing.

Uh, uh, you know,
actually I'm...
Just the water for me please.

A what? Tonight's for you.

I mean, come on.
He'll have another one on me.

You know, I asked this guy
to put together a darn near
impossible quote.

Like I never do that.

-[laughter]
-Uh, right, yeah.

Anyway Sean, it looks like
we're gonna be in the black
this summer

and that's because of you.

To Sean.

[glass clinking]

Hey, Don, I wanted to ask you
about a potential raise.

-Sean.
-Look, I've been with the
company six months now and...

Sean, let me cut you off there.

You got some balls.

I like that.

Okay.

The turbine quote
came in at 20 million, right?

Yeah, that's right.

You shave another five percent
off of that,
I can't get you a raise,

but I can get you one hell
of a bonus.


Alright, thanks.

[tranquil music playing]

[car horn honking]

But you can see,
uh, the projections show that

we are right on budget
for all three turbines

and we're really excited about
moving forward with the project.

Sounds great.

Yeah, oh...
and I have the final draft
of the contract back from legal.

We're all set with the notary
for tomorrow?

Yep, she'll meet us
at the property.

[somber music playing]

Do you guys have any kids?

I know that is a weird question
to ask,

it's just that we're in that
process right now...

I have a son.

Any advice?

Be a good dad.


You only have one shot
at being a good dad.

It's easy to mess up.

It seems like you have
a good head on your shoulders,
so you'll be alright.

Thanks.

The rest of this is pretty
standard, looks good.

Everybody here at Wescott's
doing a great job,
I appreciate that.

Let's just make sure we get
that signature tomorrow.

And we can start building
right away.

Absolutely. I don't see
why that should be a problem.

-We'll do our best for you.
-Alright. I appreciate that.

[somber music playing]

[foreign language]

[ominous music playing]

Huh?

[ominous music playing]

Hello. We were just at the house
on the corner.
No one was there.

Uh, are you the owner
of this property?

[foreign language]

[foreign language]

Counselor Campbell?

No.


I'm sorry, ma'am.

The state sets the price
for the leasing of the
properties in this project.


-She wants us to leave.
-10,000 dollars.

Tell her we'll give her
10 grand today

and we'll pay her 3%
of the profits annually.

You know we don't have that
in the budget.

I will approve any overage
just tell her.

[foreign language]

[foreign language]

[somber music playing]

[tranquil music playing]

Line 44, page 3.

Chockfast grout is the minimum
requirement on this.

Well, you know, we got to find
a way to cut the cost of it
or it's not gonna happen at all.

You don't want to do it
like that.

Going with the low-grade grout
as your sealant

will definitely sacrifice
structural integrity
of the turbines.

We're sticking
with manufacturer recommendation
on this one.

We use cosmetic grout
on our buildings all the time
and they don't fall over.

This isn't an office building.
You're gonna sacrifice
the structural integrity.

Well, do we have
any legal restrictions
by going with the cosmetics?

That's not the direction
you want to go on this one.

Maybe you're still
inside a code,

but with a foreign manufacturer
it's really hard to tell.

I want the cheaper grout, okay?

I want to see a new quote
with the cosmetic.

[man 1] We're not going with lower than recommendations.

There's too much risk for us
and any respectable contractor
will tell you the same thing.

[tranquil music playing]

[indistinct chatter]

Don't point. It's embarrassing.

No, look at him.
He's wearing two polo shirts.

Wow, you're really drunk
already.


[clears throat]

You wish.


Javier, what are we doing here?

Uh, just hanging out.

I mean, what are we doing,
like you and me?

-Um...
-These last few weeks
have been really fun

and I mean, I'm probably
getting this job here

and you're going away
in the fall probably.

Well, that might not happen.

I don't want you to change
your plans for me.

It's... It's just I don't have
enough money to go yet.

Then I have some good news
about that.

I've found a scholarship for you
and I've submitted your name
and they're gonna call you.

Why would you do that?

You're mad about this?

I... I told you that I...


I want to earn this money
on my own.

I don't want to go to school
until I made enough money.

Yeah, this helps you
get to that point.

-That's what a scholarship does.
-I don't want a handout.
I work for what I have.

And you're saying I don't?


[eerie music playing]

[bee buzzing]

I thought it must have been
a mistake

because all the forms
said 30 bags,
so I signed for the receipt.

Mm-hmm.

I mean, there's no way
this project would take
more than three bags to finish.

I mean... I mean...
and you got... the forms said
30 bags, you know.

Oh, yeah,
you did the right thing.

-So, I signed for it.
-It's no big deal.

I... It's probably my mistake
if I just ordered too much.

There's enough here to do
about nine more bathrooms.



Something like that.

[somber music playing]

[car door closes]

[car rumbling]

[car door opens]

[car door closes]

People of Kent County,
not even two months ago,

we took our first steps
towards clean renewable energy

for finding a new way
to power ourselves
through the 21st century

when we broke ground
on what we had hoped

to be the first of many wind
turbine farms in this county.

So, working with the original
twenty million-dollar bid
when we began the project,

I factored in the savings
from materials and labor

and now that the project
is complete,

I can say that the actual cost
came to just over
18 million dollars.


is the accomplishment
of many dedicated people

working tirelessly and viciously
toward one unified goal,

the sustainability
of our future.

I don't understand.
You saved 10% off our bid?

I... Yeah, you know,
I just, uh, you know,

put the squeeze
in some of the vendors,

made sure they were giving us
the best price,

and made sure the subs
weren't ripping us off.

Do you have a specified
cost breakdown?

I'm confused as to where...

I'm just happy that you had
the stones to play hardball
with those guys, Sean.

You made the firm
a lot of money.

Thank you.

of our future.

And one of those hard-working
public servants has been
your own councilman,

Robert Campbell.

Robert.


[eerie music playing]

Hey, hey.

You're gonna do great today,
okay?

How about you bring me lunch
after your interview
and we can talk about it?

They're gonna love you.

From the description
on the application,

it sounds like they're looking
for somebody just like you.

-I don't even want this.
-Javi, this is what people do
to go to school.

-You... I don't know what to say
in a scholarship interview.
-Just talk about yourself.

-You need to do this.
-I don't need to do this.

Do you even want
to go to school?

That's not fair.

You're... You're all talk.

You can't just stand around
and wait for life to happen.

You have to do something.

-Okay?
-Alright, back off, Mom.

Grow up!

[footsteps thumping]

And how long has this project
been in development?

Well, this is the first stage
of the development.

We just started this project
only about four months ago.

-We had some federal funding...
-Excuse me.

Excuse me.

-Are you responsible for these?
-Yeah, this is my project.
Robert Campbell.

You should have taken
a community vote to find out
what the people wanted.

Well, listen. We did invite
the people to call in
if they had any problems.

-In a democracy, it's the
people's vote that count.
-I'm sorry.

Senator Peterson,
I'm just so grateful that you
were able to make it out today.

I'm grateful for the wonderful
weather too, huh?

Well, I gotta hand it to you,
Robert,
this is certainly impressive.

Well, it's a month early and...
And right under budget, huh?

Well, the people in the Capitol
are very pleased.

Listen, we've got
some federal money coming down
the pipe, maybe 50 turbines.

Well, that's exactly
what this county needs,

but I was hoping to step
into that open senate seat.

Well, certainly.
Let's set up a meeting
in the next couple weeks.

-We could talk about it.
-Well, I was thinking
that it would be best

if we took advantage
of all the press

that we're getting here
on this turbine project
and announce it right away.

Well, Robert, you've certainly
done some great things out here

and I can safely say,
your name is on the short list,

but the committee
will still need to vet you

and run some background
searches.

-Sure.
-You could probably look
for a call from them.

-Alright.
-Okay?

Yeah, sure.
That's, uh, that sounds great...

That sounds great.

Listen, I'm looking forward
to working with you, senator.

Alright.

[car beeping]

Drive safe, huh.

[eerie music playing]

Mm-hm.

-Is there a second page?
-I'm... Yeah, yeah, no.

As it's... That's it.

Okay. Well, your transcripts
aren't included
in your application.

Did you bring them
with you today?

I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
that I should have brought them.

Javier, we do want to help
the Latino community,

but I need you to make an effort
here in this interview.

I didn't know
that I was supposed to bring
my transcripts.

Why don't you tell me
why you think you're qualified
for this scholarship?

I work at the community center
in Hart with the Latino kids.

Uh, I want to go to school.

Okay.

-Well, thank you for your time.
-That's it?

-Javier, I'll be in touch.
-It's Javier.

Javier, I'll be in touch
regarding the results
of the scholarship.

So, how'd it go?

He was so impressed,

he pretty much offered me
the seat right on the spot.

You're the party's
official nominee?

Well, it's not official
till we announce it,

which is why I think
that we should strike
while the iron's hot

and set up a press conference
for this afternoon.

Wait, hold on, Bob.
I think you need
to slow down, okay?

This is the party's political
machine now.

They're gonna want to run
this through the Capitol,

-the press release is not
going to get anything...
-Listen, I don't think

that you are hearing me, Cole.

We are going to announce today.

They don't just offer
the state senate seat
to the nicest guy in the room.

We've got to attack this.

We're building a name here.

Hey, Sean, Sean.

I want you to set up
a press conference at 3 p.m.

Come here, come here.
Hey, listen,
you did a great job.



[somber music playing]

[truck rumbling]


-Oh, I can help you with that.
-I got it.

-[sighs]
-I got you lunch.

Thank you.

You okay?



[plastic rasps]

Here is your salad.

-So, did you go
to your interview?
-Yeah.

-How'd it go?
-Shitty.

What happened?

I didn't bring my transcripts.

That's it?

-[Javier] Yeah, I mean...
-[Ashlee] Did you try? Like...

Yeah, I went.

That's... That's not trying.

You forgot your transcripts.

Well, yeah.
I didn't know I was supposed
to bring them.

Javier, it's on the form.

Well, I didn't see that.

You didn't read it?

Why do you always do this?

-I can't do this. This...
-What?

I can't... I can't...
I can't be with someone who...


I have to go.

-Wait, wait, wait, Ashlee.
Oh, hey.
-You know what?

Actually, I have to get to work,
so I'm going to go.

No, are you seriously thinking
about breaking up with me
because of this?

-I'll talk to you later, bye.
-I can send the forms
if that's all this is.

[somber music playing]

[somber music playing]


[door bangs close]

Mama!

Mama!

[somber music playing]

Uh, so, I thought after
the candidacy announcement, um,

we could cover
your educational platform,

then let them bring up jobs
which takes you
into renewable energy.

You alright?

Uh, yeah.
I'm so... I'm sorry, um...

-Want me to get you some water?
-Just some personal stuff.
It's...

Mama!

Okay.

[thunder roars]

Okay, I won't pry.

How do you...

How do you tell somebody
to grow up
and take their life seriously?


I don't.

have to choose for themselves

and if they choose
to just sit around

and wait for life to start
then I walk away.

I can't be bothered
with people like that.

-But what if...
-[door opens]

Ma'am.
Ma'am, you can't just barge in.

-Sir, I'm very sorry.
-No, Mary it's fine. Thank you.

Ashlee,
we'll have to finish this later.

-Do you want me to stay
and translate?
-No, we'll finish this later.

Ashlee!

Sorry.

You know I can't understand you.
Please slow down.


I can't...
I can't legally pay you.

I let you and Javier live there.
I own the farm.

Let me live there?

No, you...

I let you and Javier stay there
because you need a home,
that's all.

I want to work something out
with you.

Stay away from us.

doesn't know about you.

He doesn't know about you.
I never gave him the letters.
This is why.

You stupid bitch!
You can't keep my son from me.

I gave you everything.

You wouldn't have a roof
over your head

if I hadn't bought that farm
for my son twenty years ago.

I can go to the news
about Javier.

I will call immigration
on that whole farm

if you are still there
in the morning.

Excuse me, sir,
I've held them off as long
as I could but it's 3:15.

-What?
-The press, sir.

Oh.

[somber music playing]

[door opens]

[clears throat]

Sir, please reconsider.

We could still make this about
the turbine project
if you just hold...

[microphone feedbacks]

Thank you, all,
for coming today.

As you all know,

we have officially opened

the first three turbines
on this side of the state.

We have officially opened
the first three turbines
on this side of the state

earlier today in Hart.

[clears throat]

Uh, I have...
I'd like to announce
my candidacy for state senate.

There's work to be done

and I've proven
that I'm the man to do it, so.

What's your plan
for increasing jobs statewide?

Well, thank you
for bringing that up.

Over the past few months,
I've worked hard to build...

Over the past few months,
I've worked hard...

I'm sorry.

Hey, what are you doing here?

I have something to tell you...

-Yeah.
-...in person.

What?

You alright?

Yeah.

I think we have to cancel
our spring vacation though.


you can fly when you're
eight months pregnant.

Wait, what?

I'm pregnant.


It's called a pregnancy test,
Sean.

We're adopting.

We haven't even been trying.

I...

I just don't want you to get
your hopes up again.

I know I'm pregnant.

I've been not pregnant
enough times
to know when it feels different.


-We're having a baby.
-Okay, stop. Alright?

Look, it is just way too soon
to even know that, right?

At least until next week
at the earliest.

Or we can go do a test right now

and then you can apologize
to me.

There's an urgent care in town.

[car door closes]

[thunder roars]

[somber music playing]


[door opens]

-Not now, Ashlee.
-I know what's going on.

-What are you talking about?
-You own the farm.

You used tax dollars
to lease your own land?

Is that why we made
such a generous offer?

-Listen, Ashlee.
-No, you listen.

I have an email right here
that explains everything
to the press.

Give me one reason
not to send it.


The farmer is getting the money.

That's not true.

-I talked to her son.
-Well, that's not the...

-The arrangement
that I made with them.
-I'm going to go warn Reyna

and then I'm gonna send
this email.

-Do not do that.
-This is wrong, Robert.

-This isn't right.
-This isn't about me, Ashlee.


Right.

Hey, Sean, can you find out
how much longer?

I'll find out.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[indistinct yelling]

No, no, no, no.

Ashlee, Ashlee, Ashlee.

Go. Go, go, go.

[siren wailing]

Come on, let's just go home.

Go ahead.

Stop being like this.

Go ahead.

Come on, let's just go.

Serious, just go ahead.

Go to your motel room,
go to your girlfriend's place...

-You know what...
-Wherever you go
whenever the hell...

...maybe we should talk
about stopping
this whole adoption thing

-until you start feeling better.
-What the hell does that mean?

It means that you're not being
yourself lately

and you're acting
like a crazy...

I knew it.

I knew you didn't really want
this baby.

That's not what I'm saying.

Do you have any idea what I've
done even to get us this far?

You're not telling me the truth
and I wish you would stop
sparing my feelings

and just tell me
what the hell you want.

[breaths heavily]

You know what, I don't want
to have a baby with you.

Excuse me?
I don't want to interrupt,

but I have the results
of your blood test.

It appears...

I need a minute.

What happened here?

There was a car crash
and a turbine fell on her.

-I'm sorry, please wait.
-No, no, no.
You have to let me go please.

Sir.


[dreamy music playing]



[foot thumping]

Javier.


[ominous music playing]

[indistinct radio chatter]

-Hello, sir.
Are you Sean Foster?
-Uh, yes.

You mind stepping out and
answering a couple of questions?

Yeah, yeah, sure.

[tranquil music playing]

[pig snorting]

[somber music playing]

I'm not leaving.

You can't make me go.

That's not why I'm here.

I've worked here 20 years.

You're not gonna take it away
from me.

Reyna, things got a little
out of hand yesterday.

I think we both said some
things that... That we regret.

I'm sorry.

I should have...

I should have given you
the farm. Look, I...

I brought the deed.
I want you to have it
for real this time.

You don't want me to go?

You made this place what it is,
you deserve it.

No.

I don't understand.

I am sorry.

[door bangs close]



[somber music playing]

Sean.

Come on, talk to me.

I'm done.

Honey, don't do this.

I killed that girl.

It's my responsibility.
It was my fault.

No, we're your responsibility.
Honey, just come home.

I can't do that right now.

Damn it, don't do this.

Just leave.

[door closes]

[dogs barking]

Javier.
