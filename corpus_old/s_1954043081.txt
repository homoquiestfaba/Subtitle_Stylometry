DARKNESS CANNOT DRIVE OUT DARKNESS.

ONLY LIGHT CAN DO THAT.
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.

<i>1926. Macon, Georgia

The only thing I ever
knew was cotton.

It was hard work.

...and you know the cotton is
ready when the bulb splits,

and the bulb is star shaped,
like a big old star

in the sky. Like your big ol'
head. Oh, that's some kind!

But I didn't mind because I got to
spend all day with my dad.

Hurry up and take this picture.
Take a picture of you?

Why don't everybody smile?

Hattie, come on. I need
your help in the shed.

Come on.

Pa, where is he taking ma?
Get back to work!

Cecil, get back to work!

Mamma! - Come here.

Look at me boy. Don't lose
your temper with that man.

This is his world. We just
living in it. You hear me?

Now get on back to work!

Pa, what you gonna do?

Hey!

Dad!

What are you looking at?! Huh?

Who wants to go next?
You get back to work!

Hey you, get some of the hands to
help dig a hole for his pa. Hurry up!

Stop crying.

I'm gonna have you
in the house now.

I'm gonna teach you how
to be a house nigger.

INSPIRED BY THE TRUE STORY

He's commin'. - Yes, sir.
And quiet when you're serving.

I don't even want to hear
you breathe. - Yes, ma'am.

It was much nicer working in the
house than in the field.

Crazy, make it from the left.

Give me more.

When I got older, I knew I had to
go before he killed me too.

Part of me was scared to leave,

it was the only world I ever knew.

Ma, I took pa's watch.

Ma?

Ma, I'm leavin'.

My mamma never spoke much after that.

I knew she'd miss me.
But I also knew

she wanted me to leave that place.

And even though
Miss Annabeth never said it,

I knew she'd miss me too.

I don't think God meant for people
to not have a family.

Outside the cotton fields was even
worse than I thought it'd be.

No one would give me a job, or
food, or a place to sleep.

Any white man could kill
any of us at any time...

and not be punished for it.

The law wasn't on our side.

The law was against us.

I was hungry all the time.

You know what could
happen to you, son?

Get up.

I said get up.

I'm going to have to lie to the
boss man about that window.

Good Lord says you
ain't supposed to lie.

Sorry sir.

Where's your ma and your pa?

My Ma crazy in the head
and my Pa got killed.

I'ma make you some ham sandwiches

and send you on your way.

The boss will be here any minute.
Sunday's our busiest morning.

You looking for some help?
I know how to serve.

You done broke our window.
You done stole our food.

And now you asking for a job?
Back in Macon, I'ma house nigger.

A good one.

Don't you ever use that word son.

That's the white man's word.
It's filled with hate.

Didn't your father
teach you any better?

Slow down! - Yes, sir.

You gotta look 'em in their eyes.

See what it is they want, got it?
Sure, Mr Maynard, I got it!

See what it is they need...

Right this way.

Anticipate.

I'm - I'm sorry ma'am.

When you smile with
the eyes, be principle.

Perfect!

Don't forget to save me chitlins.
Why do you like chitlins so much?

Cuz, it's good eating. The manager
of the Excelsior in DC,

he came by yesterday.
He offered me a job as a butler.

They must be paying you
top dollar, huh boss?

Yeah...I was thinking
about taking it.

But I dunno, I'm too old to
be leaving North Carolina.

I'm just fine right here.

I told them to hire you.

I'm just now finding my
way 'round this hotel.

I'm not ready for those
high falootin' white people

with all their fancy words.
Cecil, we got two faces.

Ours, and the ones that we
got to show the white folks.

Now to get up in the world,

you have to make them feel
nonthreatened.

Use that all fancy
words that I taught you.

White folks up north, they
like some uppity coloreds.

Yeah.

<i>1957. Washington, DC

When I took that job up in
Washington, DC,

it was the most beautiful
hotel I had ever seen.

I hope I wasn't too
presumptuous to have prepared

a few spirits after your
long journey in from Buffalo.

Best decision that court ever made
was to slow this whole mess down.

Nigger boys in school with white girls?!
Who ever heard of such a thing?

Next thing you know
they'd be fornicatin'.

Gentlemen, this is different.
We could start another Civil War.

Cecil, what do you think about niggers
going to school with white children?

To be honest with you, Mr. Jenkins,

I tend to not to be too concerned
with American or European politics.

Nor should you, Cecil,
they're all criminals.

Earl Warren should be
shot and hanged.

That dumb son of bitch judge
is trying to integrate our schools.

I think, judge Warren is going to
find that quite a challenge.

Damn right, Cecil! Damn right!

Never in my life did I dream that I would
work in a place as fancy as this.

I never dreamed
my life could be so good.

Gloria and I met
working at the Excelsior.

She was a maid at the
hotel. But now,

her only job was
raising our two boys.

I made sure that they never
laid eyes on a cotton field.

I gotta pee.

Not today. Don't try that.
Finish that homework.

Where's Louis at?
He's taking the trash out.

Working late again, huh?
How was your shift?

Beats working for a livin'.

I miss you at night, honey.

Didn't you say you gotta pee?
Go ahead then.

Wash your hands when you come
out of that bathroom, boy.

Good morning.
Good morning, sir.

Hey dad! - Hey Louis.
You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine.

That woman whose son got killed,

she's around doing speeches now.
What's her name, honey?

Mamie Till. - Mamie Till...

I remember that story
just like it was yesterday

even though it was three years ago.

It was dis-damn-graceful
what they did to that boy

just for looking at a white woman...

Beat him up,
threw his body in the river...

Killed him. He was just 14
at the time.

Crazy white folks down south.

Thanks, ma. - At least we have
it a little better here in DC, huh?

Still treating us bad too.
Get on down here Charlie!

Wash your hands. - Louis said we
should stop taking the white man's shit.

Watch your mouth.
Watch your mouth.

Hello, Gaines' residence.

Uh, yeah... Hold on Mr. Kidgan.
It's the boss man dad.

What's he calling for?

When the white man called,
I always assumed the worst.

Yes sir? - I would have
put money on it,

that I was getting laid off
or something that day.

Would you follow me, please?
Yes, sir.

I'm Cecil Gaines. It's a pleasure to
meet you. - You as well. Have a seat.

Are you political, Mr. Gaines?
No, sir.

Good, we have no tolerance for
politics at the White House.

How did you find me?
I didn't.

You served RD Warner at
the Excelsior Hotel.

He oversees operations
for the entire White House.

You made quite an impression.
I don't recall.

Mr. Warner and myself make note
of potential staff around town.

Butler positions rarely open as
most stay on for 30 years or more.

I know I was quite surprised
when I got the call.

It was a surprise for me as well.

As the White House Maitre D',
I normally hire the butlers.

Forgive me for saying this,
Mr. Fallows,

I certainly wouldn't
want to be hired

under circumstances that would
make you feel uncomfortable.

Oh, really? - You need butlers
that you've hand picked,

men to your liking that
will fulfill your vision

of a proper White House staff.

Is that...Louis Trace?

These decanters are
replicas of metal flasks

that were found on the
battlefield in Jarnac. Correct?

The Italians,
they know their wines,

and the Irish certainly know how to
make a great whiskey.

But I believe the French

have a distinct advantage
when it comes to cognac.

Is that right?

Oh yeah, you'll make
a good house nigga.

Would you care for a demitasse?

"I wish I knew some other way..."

Sometimes it be just me
and Faye up in here.

Me, Faye, and a little
scotch.

Say it, Faye!

What did you do to this potato salad?
I'll tell you what I did.

I put some dill in it, because
I read in Women's Day,

where pickles drown out the flavor
and dill bring up the flavor.

That's what you tasting right there.
Oh, okay. Yeah, I like it.

It makes a different, dont' they?
It really does.

You must be so proud of Cecil.
You know he got that job by himself.

The White House called him,
he didn't call the White House.

He's a good man.
You got a good man.

She fun man!

Not like this one right here.
Little sourpuss still mad at me.

I got reason.
No you don't.

I told you I went down to
the number spot.

Played my little numbers,
got me some barbecue,

and I went down. I didn't even
get nothing to drink!

I'm so - I'm so sick of these
number spot stories, Howard.

How you expect me to believe you
was down at the number spot...

Believe or not, it was true.
Come on, come on, stop this mess.

Come on y'all. Come on...

If you don't believe,
you don't have to believe but...

Stop this mess, right now.
We are here to celebrate.

So y'all could be nice just one time.
Baby, come on. Get over here.

Celebrate!

That's right. I'll make you happy.
Y'all need to get a room!

What? - Ain't that the truth!
Or something...

He just drive me crazy!
He just...

You, uh... you wanna
come to the room? - No.

Hey where are the boys at?
They upstairs playing.

Boys! Get down here!
I need to see your face now!

What y'all doing up there?
Cecil, congratulations.

Honey, when you gonna take me
to the White House?

You wanna go to the
White House, baby?

You know I wanna go to White
House. - When you want to go?

Don't play with me now,
you know I want to go.

The White House,
that's a big step up.

It is exciting. - Girl, you are
up in that house now!

I want to hear <i>all</i> of the stories.

I don't know how many
stories you gonna hear,

'cus they done swore
him to some kind of

secret code and he
can't tell me nothin'.

No, no, no. Girl,
you give it to him right.

He'll tell you everything!
That's the key right there.

You listening?
Did you hear her?

Whom do you giving to?
Crazy. - You got at home.

I can give it to you.

I don't know what are
you talking about. - Elroy!

Here they come.

Boys stop running through this
house, you know better than that.

Elroy, get over here.
Come here.

Give me some money.

Nah... Tell them...

Tell them what you gonna
be when you grow up.

I wanna work at the White House
just like Mr. Gaines.

That's my boy! - Mine too.
Alright.

Louis! What you gonna
be when you grow up?

You gonna work at a White
House just like your daddy?

I don't know.

I'll tell ya exactly what I wanna
be when I start a thing.

Yeah, a number runner!

I'm Cecil Gaines.
I'm the new butler.

Yes, sir.

There are 16 full time maid,
we are 6 butlers,

4 carpenters, 2 painters,
7 electricians,

3 dishwashers, 3 doorman,
a full kitchen staff including

pastry chef and 3 full
time calligraphers.

2 painters, 7 electricians,
9 engineers...

Here comes Warner.

Mr. Warner, I wanted to thank you for
this opportunity to work in the Whi...

Come on. Here we go.

Ma'am, I'm Cecil Gaines,
I'll be working with you here.

Mr. Gaines, please don't
do that. Come on. - Yes, sir.

When lifting a plate,
never scrape the bottom.

Never listen or react to
a conversation.

The room should feel...
Emptiness. When I'm in.

...so then she says...

Then she says, "Stick
two fingers". "Okay."

Then she starts yelling out,
"Stick your whole hand in!”

So I put my whole hand in.

Then she yells out,
"Put both hands in!".

Okay.

Then she screams, "Now
clap!". I say, "I can't."

She looks up, smiles and says,
"See, I told you my stuff was tight."

Hey, there he is! I heard you were
coming. What's your name, brother?

Cecil. Cecil Gaines.
I'm Carter Wilson, head butler.

Don't worry about Big
Mo behind you. That brother

will steal your wallet
before you even knew it.

This brother in the mirror over here,
his name's James Holloway,

he's my second in command.
James?

Jackie Robinson or Willie Mays?

Why don't you shake the man's hand first

'fore you start asking
difficult questions like that?

I just want to know
where the man's coming from.

Look like the jury is still out
on that one, alright?

Welcome. Fancy
Freddie give you the tour yet?

He did. Are the Dodgers losing?

I might be able to
answer that question

if Carter over here stop
running his nasty mouth?

Cut that shit, let's get to work.

Ready! - Lord, help us.

Don't be nervous man.
Just go on and get to it.

You hear nothing, you see nothing.
You only serve.

Send federal troops to Little Rock?
If it comes to it, yes.

<i>1957.
The Eisenhower Administration

I can't see any situation where I'd
send troops to the South. Ever.

It would cause another Civil War.
Sir, if the Federal government

doesn't enforce Brown,
then who will?

The South must comply
with the law.

It's just going to take some time
to adjust, that's all.

I understand, Mr. President,

but if Faubus continues to block the
negro children, then what do we do?

We must enforce the Constitution.

Give Faubus more time.

With a little persuading,
he'll back down.

We just want to move slowly.

How'd it go?
I almost shit myself.

I dated a girl once. Every time I
hit it, she shit herself.

Shut up.
You shut up.

I put a towel down.

<i>Marcella said the
very same thing last night

<i>just before I put her to sleep.

<i>You put her...
Just like I did Ed.

<i>I do it real quick.

Popcorn all over sofa!

Your dad's gonna kill you.
Hey dad. - Hey.

Hi, Mr. Gaines. - Hey Elroy.

Louis, I told you about letting
the kids watch that show.

It's too scary.
They're too young for it.

Turn it off.

Where's your mamma at?

Miss Gloria tried staying up,
but she went to sleep.

Elroy, nobody asked you nothin'.

Take your butt home before
your mamma come in here

and whoop the both of us.
Come on dad. - Go on.

Bye. - Turn it off.

Don't go stomping up the stairs
and wake your mom up.

MAMIE TILL
"SPEAKS OUT"

What is that? Is that
Mamie Till stuff?

I want to go to this.
Absolutely not.

How come?

Ain't no good
gonna come of that.

Dad, you hear what mom said?

That mess right
there happen down south.

This could have been me.
It happened down south.

I got out of there so we
could have us a better life.

Right now, I'm working for the white
man, make things better for us.

And not just any white man, either.
Put the lights off. Go to bed.

I have your chicken soup,
Mr. President.

Just set it on the table, Cecil.
Yes, sir.

Did you ever complete school, Cecil?

I didn't go to school, Mr. President.
I grew up on a cotton farm.

I grew up on a farm.
Do you have any children?

Yes, I have two sons. - Do they
go to an all colored school?

Yes, sir. They do.

What is it?

The State Guard just blocked
all the colored kids again.

Faubus promised me the guards
would escort the kids in.

The Governor of Arkansas
lied, Mr. President.

What is wrong with him?!
Why is he forcing me to do this?

Our next move needs to be
bold and swift.

<i>I have today issued an Executive
Order directing the use of troops

<i>under Federal authority
to aid in the execution

<i>of Federal law at Little Rock, Arkansas.

When the President sent those
troops down to Little Rock,

it was the first time I'd ever seen

a white man stick
his neck out for us.

I told Louis that the President was
going to make things better for us.

Your graduations are long.
She was so nosy!

I'm gonna make some potato salad.

Now he could see I knew
what I was talking about.

That was wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

Thanks, mamma.
That hat looks stupid.

Your face looks stupid.

I'm proud of you too.

Dad, did you see...
Don't start up in there!

Did you see one
white kid in my school?

Why couldn't Louis see that the
President made things better for us?

Good luck. - Thanks.

Thank you.

Boy, I told you're gonna be late!
You can't miss this bus!

Wait, wait, wait! We gotta say
goodbye. This can wait!

Tennessee is a long ways away Pops.

Fisk is a really good school, dad.

You can change your mind and
go to Howard. - I cannot believe

you are still talking
about Howard University.

He's going to Fisk! - I know.

I know, it's just - it's just
so far away. That's all.

That's the point.
What's the point?

Gimme a cigarette. And don't
tell me you don't smoke.

I don't have one. Come here.
You know you wanna cry punk.

Not for you.

Look under your mattress.
I left something.

I can't protect him in the south.

The south has changed Cecil.
I'm too young for Playboys.

The south ain't what it was
when you was there.

Mom, Louis is leaving me
his filthy magazines.

Stop lying on your brother.

I love you momma.
I love you, son.

I love you Louis.

I made you a ham sandwich.
Thanks, mom.

Come on, dad.

You're the first.

I know.

I'm really proud of you.

I gotta go dad.

I gotta go.

If you need anything,
you call me. - Alright.

Alright?

Bye, mamma.

Bye, Louis.

It's all right.

Remind me again, why we're doing
this please, somebody? Tell me?

That look like a mugging to me,
this that what that look like.

This is the art of french baking.

Nigro, please.
Art of french baking...

This is absolutelly
nothing. This is, I don't...

Always so simple. - You want me
to play with it? I'll play with it.

Playing with it like this.
It'd be good if it had a little...

...a little nipple on it.
Come on, man!

This is how you
playing, you shake it.

Good evening, Mr. Vice President.

That looks like a tasty treat.

Yes, sir.

I brought you all something.

Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

I don't want to say anything
negative about that Kennedy boy.

I'm sure he's a real nice fellow,

but do you really want that
spoiled rich son of a bitch fuck

to be your next president?

Think about it.

We're cheering for you,
Mr Vice president.

Thank you, Cecil.

Let me ask you something,
in all candor,

as members of the Negro community,
what are your biggest concerns?

Come on now boys.

Don't be shy.

Holloway, come on.

Well, since you
asked, sir... - I did.

...the colored help gets paid almost
40% less than the white help.

Is that right? - Yes, sir.

And it's very difficult for the
colored staff to be promoted.

I'll tell ya what,

when I'm President I'm gonna
look into getting you boys

the raises and
promotions you deserve.

That-that would be swell, sir.
You got my word on that.

Thank you, sir.

You tell your people
to vote for me

and that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

Give this to somebody.

<i>1960. Fisk University

Carol, please. - Like that one?

I'm talking about you.

Hey.

You lookin' for love, boy?

That's what we call the Lawson
workshop, the love school.

Is that what you're lookin' for?
That's why I came to Fisk.

Me too!

I'm Carol Hammie.
Louis Gaines.

Come on. Follow me.

You a country boy, ain't you?

He's a doctor.

...nor could you sustain it in
over a month. This requires time,

commitment, dedication,
discipline and focus.

And we are measuring our
accomplishments in waves. Right?

This is not a fly-by-night affair,
this doesn't happen over a week,

this requires a fierce discipline,
which is what we've been discussing.

How do we measure
these things? We go back

and look at someone
like Ghandi. Together,

we are going to study and
examine Ghandi's techniques.

What has been so effective in
South Africa, so effective in India,

for his own people and others,

and we're gonna employ it
right here, in Nashville.

So we're gonna form
an army, you and I.

This army has one weapon,
and that weapon is love.

Now I am of the...Yes?

If our only weapon is love
and their weapons are...

Weapons - isn't that dangerous?
Oh, you can be killed.

If anyone is uncomfortable with
that, you know where the door is.

I understand that sounds
provocative, but it's true.

Alright kids.
It's show time.

Ghandi has demonstrated
for us that a brown man,

in his native land, or anywhere
that he is being oppressed,

can pull himself out of segregation
with patience, with persistence,

with intelligence and
thought. With discipline...

...and a bit of a
sense of humor.

COLORED

You know y'all can't sit here.

We would like to
be served, please.

This is unprecedented
what we're talking about.

But it needs a patience that
none of us have ever seen.

You can order food
in the colored section,

but I'm not going to be
serving you here.

We are organized. We have
a leader with every group.

We have lookouts,
with pocket change,

and the local phone numbers
for ambulances ready.

And when one wave comes off that
lunch counter, what follows?

A whole another wave of negro
students sitting right there

at that lunch counter
blowing their minds.

We would like to be served, please.

Now, who wants to role play?

Jim, I need your
help over here.

Now, y'all know you're not
supposed to sit there.

Attack! - Get up, niger!
This is an experiment.

So you need to do whatever
it takes to break their spirit.

Come on, get up!
Use the language.

I need to hear nigger
coming out of your mouth.

I need to hear coon. - I don't feel
comfortable saying that.

You came here to get yourself
prepared, and get her prepared.

So let me hear it, now!

Nigger. - Louder.

Say the words
like you mean it!

Nigger! - Louder.
You are a nigger!

You need to be sitting
in the colored seating.

This is not for you! You
cannot be served here!

You need to do what was
told is sitting in your place.

You are a nigger!
Make her believe it!

You know is there
where colored people sit.

You see this people over here?
They're in their section over here.

Get up! Get up, you nigger!

If you want us to shop in this
establishment, make them go!

Come on, Robert.
Let's go.

Get up, monkey!
What is this?!

Get up! Come on, get up!

What are you doing here?

What are you reading?
Nigers can read, ha?

What, are you stupid? You're a nigger
lover now? - Get up! Get up!

You hear me?!

Disrespect, fuckin', ha?

Stop it! Stop it!

Get up! Get up, niggers!
Look at me!

Want some more pomfri?

To serving our country.
To serving our country.

You are all sentenced to
30 days in the county jail.

Get those niggers out of here.

Something special's
going on down here, dad.

What's so special about
another colored man in jail?

What are you doing with my
hard earned money, Pops?

Are you even in school?
I'm trying to change the way

negroes are perceived...
You're breaking the law!

That judge just sentenced you to
30 days in the County Work House.

You'll get killed. - If I can't
sit at any lunch counter

I want then I might
as well be dead.

But dad, we're fighting
for our rights. - Fight?!

Boy, what are you talking about?
We're going to change nation's

consciousness toward the American
negro. - And postcards you sent me?

You're a damn liar!
Hey!

Who do you think you're talking to?
I brought you into this world

and I'll take you out of it.

Y'all been able to talk to him?
Talk to who? - Louis.

Yeah, we talk to him.

He said he joined something
called the "Freedom Riders",

whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

You gonna see him?

I've been fixing to trying to
see him. Every time I do,

Cecil get all riled up so I don't
know when that's gonna happen.

Fixing to trying...
See that's the problem.

You gotta stop trying
and you just got to do it.

He take you
to the White House yet?

No. Cecil say we goin' soon.

Cecil say, Cecil say...

Four years. That's what makes
you a little bit gullible darling.

Yeah, I don't understand why he can't
get the President to do something.

You see, Ginam that's your problem.
You just say stupid stuff.

The President's got more to do than
be thinking about Louis' foolishness.

You know, why don't you just shut
up? It's just a mess! Be nice!

Who told you, you
could tell me to shut up?

Well, you... - Go get me a drink.
I want some scotch.

Well, I personally think Louis gonna
get every one of us killed.

They comin' to get us, they
comin' to get us...

He crazy like his mamma.

I meant it in a good way!

I'm sorry! Im sorry...

The President lives at the White House

until the moment
the next one is sworn in.

So the staff has exactly two hours
during the inauguration ceremony

to move the old President out
and move the new one in.

They say this new
white boy is smooth.

<i>1961. The Kennedy Administration

I just need to get
my butt home to Gloria.

These hours are killing us.

How's your boy doing, Cecil?
Gentlemen, the President's arriving.

Where should we start?
I'm not sure. This end?

Maybe over here? - Thank you.
Right this way Mr. President.

Hello, everyone.
Hello, Mr. President!

I'm thrilled to be working with all
of you over the next four years.

Eight years, Jack.

Well, you see who wears
the pants around here.

If I'm lucky remembering
your names, I'm gonna try.

Jessy - it's good thing you're
here, 'cus I never forget.

James. - Mr. President.

Carter. - Mr. President.

This is Cecil. - Pleasure to
meet you, Mr. President.

Miss Kennedy...

How are you?

She's all right. Pleasure to
meet you Miss Caroline.

Stop, okay? Stop.
What's that?

I can smell gin in your breath.
That says Addison's Disease.

Stop. Did you take Charlie
to the dentist today?

Does someone at the White House
got Addison's disease?

No, I did not take Charlie
to the dentist today.

And what you asking
me about it for? You never home.

Now, you gonna act like you gonna
take Charlie to the dentist?

You ain't never here, I don't know
how you gonna take him.

His teeth fall out
waiting on you to take him.

Just go to bed Gloria.
I'll take him tomorrow.

Hoe many pairs of shoes
does she have?

I said, how many pairs of shoes
does Miss Jackie Kennedy have?

How the hell do I know?!

You in that White House
all day and night...

I thought you knew
everything.

Coming in and telling
me what to do...

Worry about me drinking. You ought
to be worried about your house!

Our boy's in jail, Cecil!

Our boy's in jail,
and you can't come home!

You don't see I'm
here trying to talk to you?!

I bet you wish I spoke
French just like Jackie?

Jackie Kennedy...
Que sera, sera...

You like that?
You like the way she talk?

Cecil, you hear me talking to you?

You ain't asleep.

Bobby told the President

that they shouldn't be worried
about the Negro sit-ins.

Polls showed the US
does not support civil rights.

Told you that white boy was
smooth...

A little too smooth for
my money.

Cecil, how's your boy doing?
Out of jail.

He says he's back in
school. But I think,

he's doing that
freedom riding thing.

How's Gloria doing with
that drinking?

She's hangin'.

You see that Kat that's
playing? He's a big deal.

Pablo Casals. World famous.
Course, he's world famous!

You think Ms. Kennedy's
gonna have some

back woods country fiddle band
playing out there for her? - Man...

Why don't you start a band.
Maybe you could go out there too?

You know, in fact,
let's all start a band!

I'll play the bongos... What about
you? - I'll play a mean skin flute.

Casals is a righteous soul.
He refuses to play

in any country that
recognizes Franco's regime.

Who's Franco?

Forget it, man. - Huh?
Forget it. You're ignorant.

Carol, you tired?

You want me to put my
head on your shoulder?

What's wrong with that? - I'm not
putting my head on your shoulder.

You can...

You ever been on a Freedom Bus
before? - No, it's my first time.

No? How's your boyfriend
feel about that? - My boyfriend?!

Yeah. He must be upset at you,
being on this bus? Down here.

I don't have a boyfriend.
You don't have a boyfriend?

How do you not have a boyfriend?

Do you want some?
No, thanks.

It's too hot to eat.

It's a long bus drive.

Louis, what is that?

It's a Cross! It's a Cross!
Driver, turn! Turn the bus!

Shit! Shit!

Get out! Get out!

<i>Alabama hates niggers!

Oh, my God!
Everybody out!

In an old house in Paris
that was covered in vines,

lived 12 little girls
in two straight lines.

The smallest one was Madeline.
Like Caroline!

She was not afraid of mice.

Why do people ride
in the Freedom Bus?

Uncle Bobby told my daddy,
that the Freedom Bus exploded.

Today.

I didn't know if
my boy was dead or alive.

Hello? - <i>Hi, dad.</i>

I'm in Mississippi.

<i>I thought you was in Alabama.
We spent two weeks in jail there

<i>now we're in Mississippi.</i>
I want you to listen to me, Louis.

I want you to come home.

<i>I know we ain't seen eye to eye,

<i>but your mamma,
she wants you home.

They keeping me.

How long? - Where is he?
<i>I don't know...</i>

<i>They said 3 months. When I get
out, I'm gonna take another ride.

What are you talking about?!
What is he saying?

Let me talk to him.
Give me that phone!

<i>It is my right to ride that bus.
That is my legal right,

and I will exercise my rights
as an American citizen.

<i>American citizen?
What you talking about?

You know what they gonna do
to you? They gonna lynch ya.

Then they gonna throw
your little ass in the river.

They gon' kill you.

Ma, then they just
gonna have to kill me.

I don't know what country I'm
looking at.

Louis man...That little nigga
might be on to somethin'.

Stop calling him a nigga,
cause he ain't no nigga.

What's wrong, baby?

What's wrong with me is...this.
What are you talking about?

This is what's wrong with me.
You know what? This is wrong.

You used to like wrong. - This is
wrong. - We ain't been wrong yet.

I can't do this to Cecil.
We ain't doing this to Cecil.

I'm doing it to you.

I want you out of my house.

Why do you think God brought us
next to each other each day?

God ain't got nothing to do with this.
He put you right next door to me.

You always talk about how lonely you are
with Cecil being at the White House,

and you need a man that
can appreciate the love

and the woman you are like I do.

I want your number running ass
up out of my house,

off my sofa right now.

I'm through! I told you!

Let me make a
demonstration for you.

Don't come up with
this bullshit crazy stuff.

This is you, right?
You got your direction.

This is you.
And this is me.

We seem like we don't fit at all.
We just crash into each other.

But, when you align things properly,

like God putting you next door to me,

everything kinda works out.

And even if you
slow down, I got you.

You need to get your yellow
ass up out of my house.

We need each other. - What
I need is my husband.

And not to be laying up
here in the gutter with you.

On an average, how many pills do
you think I take a day, Cecil?

About 103, sir.

Help me up. - Mr President...

I know your son
is a Freedom Rider.

He's in prison right now in
Birmingham with Martin Luther King.

Do you...Do you know
how he is, sir?

I'm guessing he's beat up.
But based on his record,

he must be used to it.

Cecil, he's been arrested 16 times
over the past two years.

Yes, sir.

Anything else?
No, that's it.

You know, I never understood

what you all really went
through, until I saw that.

My brother says these kids
have changed his heart.

They've changed mine too.

<i>The fires of discord are burning
in every city north and south,

<i>where legal remedies
are not at hand.

<i>Regress is sought in the streets,

<i>with demonstrations,
parades, and protests.

<i>I am therefor asking the
Congress to enact legislation

giving all Americans the right
to be served in facilities

which are open to the public.
<i>Hotels, restaurants, theaters,</i>

<i>retail stores and similar
establishments.

<i>This seems to me to
be an elementary right.

<i>This denial is an arbitrary indignity

have to endure, but many do.

<i>A great change is at hand.

<i>And our task,

CBS NEWS BULLETIN

Hey...Hey Cecil.

Cecil, what's wrong?

Cecil.

Cecil?

They blew his...

...head off.

Who are you talking about?
Kennedy.

<i>President Kennedy was
shot as he brought

<i>from Dallas airport
to downtown Dallas...

<i>Governor Conelly, who
was in car, was also shot.

<i>There is report that
three of bullets ran out.

Mrs. Kennedy refused
to change her clothes

so that everybody could see
what they did to her husband.

The last time I saw
that much blood

was the day my daddy was killed.

Please, tell me how
I could help you.

Mom? What are you doin'?

Here. I want you to take this box
and put it down in the basement.

Make sure you label it "trophies".
This is Louis' stuff.

You know he's gonna be pissed. - I don't
care about Louis being pissed.

I'm the one who's pissed.
He ain't been here in three years.

Why you pissed mom? - And don't
put that next to my jarred okra.

Ain't no body trying to
smell that stankin' okra!

And when you come back, I want
you to get me some fish food.

Look what the President...
Mrs. Kennedy gave me.

It belonged to the President.

Gloria, the President was killed.

I'm really sorry about the
President. I really am.

But you and that White House
can kiss my ass.

I don't care what's
going on in that house.

I care what goes on in this house.

I knew that Gloria had been
unhappy for some time now.

I knew that's
probably why she drank.

She wanted me to
get along better with Louis.

I didn't know how, if I couldn't.

If I could, I'd cut back long
hours at the White House.

And I did just that.

How many pairs of shoes she's
got? - She got about...125.

125 pairs of shoes. - Yeah. I put
them in a line from the blacks,

all the way to the whites.

And I'll tell you what

The next time there is a light
on in an empty room,

I will fire every sorry
son of a bitch in this house!

<i>1964. The Johnson Administration</i>
I mean it, Cecil!

I'll go back to Texas and run the country
from a dirt shack if I have to!

Is that what you want?!
Who do you think pays

the God-damned bills
around here. I don't,

but you know what I mean.
Yes, sir.

Yeah, I almost forgot. Ladybird
and I want you to have this.

It matches your eyes.
Thank you, sir.

I see you baby! - You know
how daddy likes it! - Put it on!

Negro! Get out here! Back there
stinkin up my bathroom!

Oh Lord, what you doing?

Give me my wig!
What's wrong with you?!

This my good wig!
Oh shit. Oh, shit!

James told me that
Dr. King told the President

we would be going to the streets
down south for our right to vote.

Didn't you baby? - What?
Didn't you tell me

that Dr. King told the President
that we was going down south

for our right to vote?
I ain't make that up.

Is that what you heard?
That Dr. King ain't no joke

with his little militant ass.
Who she talking to?

Well, it look like
someone is talking...

Shut up!
Leave my bird alone.

You know three kids
got killed down there.

Trying to get colored folks
registered to vote.

That's why I didn't want
Louis to go down there.

That's what I was trying to tell you. - Well
you shouldn't have sent him down there.

I know. - Well he is
down there now,

and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

The only reason why
the President sent the FBI,

is cause two of them were white.
Now, who told her that?

Where did you hear that?
I didn't tell you that!

It was in one of them colored
newspapers from Baltimore!

That alright with you?

See, she getting smart now. Damn!

Honey, you think the President
ought to do something about

the voting rights bill?
President Johnson just passed

the greatest piece of civil rights
legislation since Lincoln freed the slaves.

it's going to be very difficult to
pass another bill anytime soon.

That's it. - You see,
how my wife quizzes me?!

I get it every day. - Only you
gotta know how much to say,

and when you cross the line. - You deal
with your woman, I'll deal with mine.

At least you tell your wife what's
going on over there. - Aces!

Damn! - You can't be king
in your one castle.

Hey, Glo. Did you all hear
about your neighbor Howard?

Guy down on 8th st. caught
him in bed with his wife.

Shot him dead.
Shot him in the back.

That's it.
That's all of it.

I don't know. Maybe he
got what he deserved.

You sorry sap asses gotta realize that
the nigger ain't gonna take it no more.

This entire country is a tinderbox.
A goddamn tinderbox

of nigger rage just
waitin' to explode!

I want all of you to get on the
phone, call the NAACP, Core

and who ever else will listen
to your sorry asses

and help me keep them
niggers off the street!

Buck, I smell your ass from here!
What the hell are you waiting for?!

Jesus Christ!

Cecil, get me some of that
god-damned prune juice.

I'm not sure what to
make of Malcolm X.

I know what to make of. He's got a
better plan in place than Dr. King.

If someone puts their hands on you,
put them in the cemetery.

<i>1965. Malcolm X Speaking Tour</i>
That's a better plan?

We gonna go. - Alright, good night.
Good night.

You just mad because he
talking about your daddy.

What? - He was saying all that
stuff about house negroes.

I saw you get mad. - My dad
is not a house negro.

He's a butler, ain't he?
Don't talk about my dad.

I don't talk about
your dad, alright?

That's because my daddy's
proud of what I'm doin'.

You alright?

Everybody went to church to raise
money for the kids down in Selma.

But I didn't go. I wasn't going to give
money to pay for my son to be killed.

Once again, them kids got beat.

This one was so bad that the press
called it "Bloody Sunday".

How are your boys, Cecil?

I don't know how my
oldest is, Mr. President.

I believe he might be in Selma.

Sometimes I feel like we're
living in two different worlds.

I just want to keep them safe.

<i>Every American citizen must
have an equal right to vote.

<i>Yet, the harsh fact is that in
many places in this country

<i>men and women are kept from voting,
simply because they are Negroes.

Negroes? Since when they
start calling us negroes?

That nigger uses the word
nigger more than I use it.

<i>Really, it's all of us,
who must overcome

<i>the crippling legacy of
bigotry and injustice.

<i>And we shall overcome.

<i>Hey, hey LBJ, how many

I DON'T GIVE A DAMN FOR UNCLE SAM!

At least, they shut up.

<i>First rifle shots ricochet around

<i>taking the first casualties on the squad.

<i>The snipers, maybe only
two or three on the wall.

<i>1968. Memphis, Tennessee<i>
There's also a machine gun down the street...

President Johnson is making a
tragic error in Vietnam.

Move on, Big Yellow. - Why
shouldn't we fight in Vietnam?

The Vietcong don't
call us niggers, for one.

Seriously, how many of your
parents support the war?

Well my Lord...Why do
your parents support it?

We haven't spoken about it
specifically, I just know they do.

What do your daddy do?

He's a butler.

The black domestic plays an
important role in our history.

I didn't tell you
that to make fun of me.

Young brother, the black
domestic defies racial stereotypes

by being hardworking and trustworthy.

He slowly tears down racial
hatred is the example

of his strong work ethic
and dignified character.

Now while we perceive the butler or
the maid as being subservient

in many ways they are subversive,
without even knowing it.

Come in, Cecil.

Good afternoon, Mr. Warner.

Thank you for seeing me.

Since the colored...

The black staff does just as
much work as the white staff,

I believe that our salaries
should reflect our service, sir.

"Black" staff?

I also feel that we should have...

...opportunities of advancement.

I know black housemen
has ever been promoted,

to be engaged in this office.

You're very well liked here, Cecil.

But if you're unhappy
with your salary or position

than I suggest you seek
employment elsewhere.

With all due respect, sir... - Don't let
that Martin Luther King shit

fill your britches out. Just
remember where I found you.

Yes sir.

Excuse me.

<i>Dr Martin Luther King, the apostle on
nonviolence and Civil Rights Movement,

<i>has been shot to death
in Memphis, Tennessee.

I didn't know if I was
gonna get home alive.

It was the first time I felt like I
didn't belong in my own neighborhood.

The whole world was changing
and I didn't know where I fit in.

Ma? My room's pink.

Make sure you get some
of my sweet potatoes, Carol.

I use orange juice when I make ‘em.
That what make ‘em so tart.

How long ya'all been dating?
5 Years. - We're just friends.

Is all the rest of the students
getting involved in politics too?

There's been a division,
kind of a split Ma.

A few of them like John Lewis
are... - I love John Lewis.

How do you know who John Lewis is?
Because I read JET Magazine.

I'm not just sitting up there,
sewing for you all day.

I'm getting sick and tired of
gettin' thrown in jail.

Yeah? Well that makes
two of us, don't it?

Dr. King's philosophy
ultimately got him murdered.

It worked when we started, but
now it's time to take the next step,

which is politics. - What, so y'all
going to the White House now?

Dad, Louis going to the
White House.

You know they ain't gonna let
you in with them nipples out.

Maybe one, but not both of
them out. - Shut up.

Nah, we're more grass roots,
one on one with the community.

Although we have started
our own political party.

What's your party?
You like to party?

I like to party. What's your
party called?

The Black Panther Party.
What kind of name is that?

What that stand for? - We provide
free breakfast for children,

free medical clinics, free clothing
and self defense classes.

And why y'all need self defense?
We ain't gettin' beat no more.

Me and your daddy saw a
wonderful movie the other night

reminded me so much of you.

Oh yeah? - What was the name
of that movie, honey?

"In the Heat of the Night".

"In the Heat of the Night"
with Sidney Poitier.

Lord, Sydney Poitier.
I love Sydney Poitier...

Sidney Poitier is the white man's
fantasy of what he wants us to be.

But his movies have him
fighting for equal rights.

Only in a way that is acceptable
to the white status quo.

And the brother can't act.

What are you talking about? He just
won the Academy Award...

He's breaking down barriers
for all of us. - By being white.

By acting white. Sidney Poitier is
nothing but a rich Uncle Tom.

Look at you. You all puffed up.

You got your hat on your
head. Coming in here.

Saying whatever you want.

Your girlfriend is belching at the
table. You don't even think

you need to go to school even
though I gave you the money.

You need to go.

Yeah, Louis, I need you
to get out of my house.

What?

Get a hell out of my house!- Cecil!
Cecil no! No, no, no! Cecil, no!

I can't take this no more! - Please!
We ain't seen this boy!

We ain't seen this boy in years!
Now everybody just sit down!

I'm sorry, Mr Buttler! I didn't
mean to make fun of your hero!

Everything you are
and everything you have,

is because of that butler.

Now you take that triflin',
low class bitch

and get out of this house!

I like Sydney Poitier, daddy.

Y'all gonna make me late for work.

Uncle Carter, I'm sorry. Who else
am I gonna call to bail him out?

What they got him in
for this time? Sit up!

He said the cop
stopped him "just because".

Just because? - He said he wasn't
gonna get beat no more, so...

He got out the car and
hit him back.

What about that little gal of his?

They put her in the hospital.

In the hospital? Charlie this
shit's gotta stop, man.

I'm late for work. You tell
Louis I'm not his momma.

I want my money back.

You alright?

Yeah, I'm alright.
Thanks, Uncle Carter.

You can take all this Black Panther
shit somewhere else.

I'm not them, I want my
money back. Hear me?

Yes, sir. - Every dime.

Hey Uncle, don't tell Daddy.

How you avoid anal sex in prison?

Do they teach you that
at The Panthers?

They teach you how to sit?

She been drinking again?
No. She sober.

She ain't doing nothing but sewing
and feeding them damn fishes.

Feed them more than
she feed me.

You excited about
going back to Howard?

I'm excited about not going back.

What? - Yeah.
I'm going to Vietnam.

Charlie, don't do this. Don't do this!
This country treats us like dogs!

Do what?! Don't do this?

You fight your country.
I wanna fight <i>for</i> my country.

I'm not going to
your funeral. - Good.

I wanna know every god-damn
domestic policy decision right now,

and I want it on the
table right now. - Okay.

Did you get the memos
we sent last week?

John and I strongly agree
that the time calls for...

<i>1969. The Nixon Administration</i>
There's a God damned fly in here.

Jesus Christ... - John and I agree
that the time calls for

a period of benign neglect.
Benign neglect? - Yes.

I like that. I like that.

<i>Black Panther Headquarters</i>
The pigs in the media,

describe us as terrorists. A
terrorist is one who terrorizes

and frightens others. We're the
ones getting terrorized!

How can we exist in peace

when we scared to walk down
the street to the store?!

Now there's this whole black power
movement going on, right?

What if we...

What if Nixon promotes black power
to mean black businesses

and we find ways to support
black entrepreneurs.

We pass the buck on
desegregation to the courts,

but push black enterprise to win
the 20% that could vote our way...

Excellent. - Excellent, sir.

You don't know if
your ceiling gon' cave in,

'cause your slumlord too busy
running around collecting rent checks,

but he won't fix your roof.
It's time that we take a stand

against these injustices that plagued
our community! They take one of ours?

We takin' two of theirs!
That's right! - Spin time!

We just need to make sure
that "Nixon's black power"

doesn't equate Nixon
with the Black Panthers.

Have you lost your mind? Did you
read Hoover's last memo on that?

That's my point. - It's God damned
terrifying. No, no, no...

I gave him the green light to
gut those sons of bitches...

Absolutely. - Round them all up and
throw them down an elevator shaft.

I don't proclaim to know
everything. But I promise you,

they'll always beware of
the nigger with a gun.

Will there be anything else,
Mr. President?

How many kids we got comming to
the breakfast tomorrow morning?

We got about 25 or 30.
25 or 30 kids...

What are we doing here?

I thought this meant to be
our community service.

This IS community service.
Someone kills one of us,

we kill two of theirs?
Community protection!

Are you ready to
kill somebody, Carol?

'Cause I ain't.

I am.

Did you ever love me, baby?

<i>Today, a day after the shoting with

<i>In police shooting were killed at least
4 Black Panthers in the past year,

Hi, baby! - Hi.

Happy birthday to you!

Well, this is the present I want,
right here.

Well, you want it right here?

Alright! - Right here?
Kids up? Kids down?

Ain't no kids in the house no more!

Hey, I made you a birthday cake. - I got
all the cake I want right here. - No!

You crazy. Hey, I got some
champagne, cooling in the ice box.

And some ice cream too!
Get some ice cream.

You gonna be drinking with me?

You know, I don't drink.
I don't drink.

I was just playing with you. I was
just seeing if it worked. Go ahead.

Oh, my God!

We get any mail from Charlie today?

No.

No? - I haven't heard from Charlie.
I know, I got an idea.

I think we should go to
Shantay's tonight. - Oh, no!

No, I'm too old for disco. - We not
old! Come on! We ain't old!

Our boys are gone! Just you
and me! You and me!

We are free...Oh! I forgot this.
I forgot this.

Now, look at us.

A little happy birthday present.

I want you to go put it on,
upstairs. - Put it on? - Yeah.

Go, put it on. Make it snappy!
Bring down my sewing kit

'cause I need to do
some alterations.

Make it snappy!

Hello?

Hi, where are you?

Where?!

You should call me back because
this is not a good time.

He's here... - They fit!

We gonna be going out tonight!
He's home and...- They're good.

You alright? - Who that?

Call me back...

Oh, it's Louis. He's asking
for some money?

Hey, Louis.

I didn't expect to hear
from you on my birthday.

You should feel ashamed of yourself.

You're a grown ass man and your calling
your mamma asking for money.

Well guess what,
it's the butler's money.

It's Uncle Tom's money. And he
ain't giving none out today.

Bye.

I'll get it.

You got the wrong house...

It's the wrong house.

Vietnam took my boy.

And I didn't understand why we
were there in the first place.

<i>1974. Nixon's Second Term

Your father still alive, Cecil?

No, sir. My father died
when I was a child.

Is there anything else that
you would like, Mr. President?

Come sit. Sit down.

There's been a lot of talk of me
resigning, things of that nature,

but I just want you to know
that it's never gonna happen.

I'm gonna come out of this
thing stronger than ever.

Is there anything else that
you would like, Mr. President?

Louis is here, looking for you.

I finished school. I got
my masters in political science.

Hey, that's what I'm talking about.
Get that education.

There he is! Hey, well
I'ma let you all to it.

Ain't no need for that, Carter.

Hey, dad.

Get out of here, Louis!

Dad? - I said, leave.

Keep doing what you doing.

Thank you, uncle Carter.

Why you do that? Huh?
That was wrong.

The boy's hurtin' too. You know he's
just trying to get his act together.

He should be hurt, Carter.

Boy didn't even go to his
own brother's funeral.

He's full of shit is what he is.
He ain't doing nothing right.

He just got his masters! What more
you want him to do?!

Every grey hair I have,
is colored of that boy.

The years started to drift by but,

the pain in my heart
never went away.

Through it all,
Louis and I never spoke.

<i>In our district alone,
we have 9% unemployment.

<i>The country at large, 14%,

<i>60% of those are Black or Hispanic.

Really?

Alright then. I appreciate it.

Nah, he didn't win.

I think you should call him.

Right after Charlie passed, Louis
came over and paid me a visit.

He found me on the kitchen floor.

I had passed out. Drunk.

I'd gone to the bathroom
all over myself.

He was the one who cleaned me up.

And then he told me
I was the best mother,

anybody could ever want.

I think he had...

he'd want to hear from his daddy.

I think you ought to call him.

Cecil!

<i>1986. The Regan Administration</i>
Cecil! - Yes, Mr. President.

You stay there, I'm coming to you.

I have a secret mission for you.

Yes, sir? - I like to send people
money when they write me

about their financial problems, but my
staff has been trying to get me to...

...stop. You think you could
help me to - keep this going?

Absolutely, Mr. President.

I appreciate your help with this.
And please, don't tell Nancy.

Of course, not.

Morning, Cecil.

Morning, Mr. Warner.

May I sit down?

I've been here for almost...
Twenty years now.

For all that time,

the black help has been paid a
smaller salary than the white help.

And I just don't think it's right,
Mr. Warner.

There are black housemen who
should be engineers by now.

They should've been promoted
years ago.

You think so?

I'm gonna have to be paid
the same as the white help,

or I'ma have to move on.

I guess you'll be moving on then.

I told the President,
that you'd say that.

He told me to tell you to
take this up with him, personally.

Excuse me.

I'm not comfortable with all the foreign
policy hawks surrounding Ronnie.

We need more moderates on
his staff.

And I want a summit
with the Russians.

Ronnie has to meet with them face to
face if we really want to thaw this ice.

Cecil. - Yes, Mrs. Reagan?
We will talk.

Yes ma'am? - You're very
popular around here.

Everyone says you're the man that
got them raises and promotions.

I had no idea! - I wish I could
take credit for that.

I'd like to invite you to
the State Dinner next week.

But I'm going to be there, Mrs.
Reagan. - No. Not as a butler, Cecil.

I'm inviting you as a guest.

But, the President prefers
for me to serve him personally.

Don't you worry about, Ronnie.
I'll take care of that.

So, we'll see you next week.
You and your wife.

My wife?

It's...It's Gloria, yes?

Yes, ma'am. - Yes.

This is the Entrance Hall.

Beautiful!

Can I get you a glass
of champagne, Mr. Gaines?

Shut up! - Alright!

Ladies and Gentleman, the President
and First Lady of the United States.

It was different sitting at the
table instead of serving it.

Real different.

I could see the two faces
the butlers wore to survive.

And I knew I lived my life
with those same two faces.

Gloria looked so happy,
but I didn't feel the same way.

I guess I wished we were
there for real, instead of show.

I think that's <i>bon appetite</i>,
everybody.

You a black motherfu...!

I want to make myself
clear on this issue.

If Congress passes sanctions
against South Africa,

I will be forced to veto
those sanctions.

Well, Mr. President, we feel
that would be a major mistake.

The brutal repression of
South African black citizens

makes no longer
a foreign policy issue,

but a United States racial issue.

We're Senators from your own party.
That's why we feel so comfortables

in letting you know that South
Africa is a human rights disaster.

Black people are being beaten, tortured,
gunned down in the middle of the street.

Americans see this on TV.
They're horrified by Apartheid.

I've made my decision.

Mr. President, your reputation
as a world leader is at stake.

The USA needs to be on the right
side of history on the race issue.

I'll say it again.

If Congress passes this bill,

I will veto it.

Period.

What, you reading now?

Get up and do the dishes ‘fore
I shoot you in the head.

Nothing seemed right to me
after that State Dinner.

I got all confused.

They started writing books

about everything Louis
and his friends had done.

Louis was never a criminal.

He was a hero!

Fighting to save the soul
of our country.

Would you like a cookie?

Cookie? - Thank you.
Thank you.

Cookie?

I had always loved serving.

But it just felt different now.

I didn't know that an old man
could feel so lost.

But that's how I felt...

That's how I felt.

Americans always turned a blind eye

to what we had done to our own.

We look out to the world and judge.

We hear about the
concentration camps.

But these camps went on
for 200 years...

Right here, in America.

I buried my daddy right over there.

My mamma would have
been right proud of me,

being with a man like yous.

Taking such good care of me
all of these years.

I love you, Cecil Gaines.

I love you more, Gloria.

Are you sure about this?

Yes, sir.

I just want to be the one who
tell you first, that's all.

You're the best butler here.
You are like family, Cecil.

It's been an honor serving you.

Not just for me, I'm sure I speak
for all the Presidents

when I say that you've served
your country well.

Thank you, Mr. President.

Cecil?

This whole civil rights issue...

I sometimes fear I'm...

...on the wrong side of it.
That I'm...just wrong.

Sometimes I think I'm just
scared of what it really means.

But I'm trying to not be
so scared anymore.

Who do we want to free?
Mandela!

When do we want him free?
Now!

Twenty years ago, we marched in
this country for our rights.

Today, we march to free
the people of South Africa.

Ronald Reagan has attacked or dismantled
every civil rights program

that has ever been put in to place!

Aiding the oppression of black South
Africans is absolutely consistent

with his policies on
race issues. Am I right?

Am I right?

Excuse me...Steven!
Where is Steven?

Free Mandela y'all!

Hi, dad.

Hi, Louis.

What are you doing here?

I'm here to protest with you.

You'll get arrested dad. You'll
lose your job.

I've lost you.

I'm sorry...

I'm sorry, son...

Don't worry dad, we'll be
out of here in a few hours.

Who said I was worried?

After going to jail, I thought
I had seen it all.

But I'd never imagined

I'd see a black man be
a real contender

for the President of the US.

Gloria and I would walk to our
polling place every night

to see where we would be
voting for Barack Obama.

We would just stare at it
and smile.

You done?
Pretty much.

Good. You done good.

You done pretty good
there. Thanks, honey.

How come Louis' wife
name that child...

Shaquanda? - Now don't
start that again.

I ain't starting it, I just don't
know what kind of name that is.

I mean, really, Shaquanda?!

I think she done that
just to spite me.

Honey, ain't nobody done
nothing to spite you.

Yes, indeed.

She an ugly little girl, too.
That little pug nose...

I hope she grow out of it.
You need to stop that.

You know that ain't right.

Don't you think she look a little
like Louis around the mouth?

I think she look just like you.
Like me?! - Yes.

So, you need to stop
talking about her.

Let me look at her again
then real good...

She do look a little bit like me.

She a pretty little thang.

I forgot where I put my Bible.

You know I need my Bible.

I think I left it in the bathroom.
Why is Louis late?

Boy gets elected into Congress

and he ain't been on time
getting us to church ever since.

I can't believe,
you still fussing...

He's going to be late
to his own funeral.

You still fussing about Louis. - He
said he gonna be here for us!

Go ahead and call.
I ain't calling Louis.

I'm gonna get my purse...

What did you say, Isiah...

You got that mark here.

I'm gonna fall over myself.
Baby...

Baby?

Honey?

You sleeping?

Baby?

Are you alright?

Louis!

Louis, come on down!
Come down!

<i>And CNN can now project that
Barack Obama, 47 years old,

place where all things are possible;

our founders is alive in our time;

Look them in the eye...

See what it is they want.

See what it is they need.

Anticipate.

Bring a smile to
the principal's eyes...

Mr. Gaines, I'm Admiral Rochon
the Chief Usher.

It's nice to meet you, Chief.
The pleasure's all mine, sir.

I just wanted to tell you what
an honor it is to meet you, sir.

The honor is mine.

The President so excited
to meet with you.

Well...

that's just fine.

Let me show you the way.
I know the way.

The heart of the question is,

whether all Americans are to be afforded
equal rights and equal opportunities.

It is the effort of American Negros,

to secure for themselves the full
blessings of American life.

We will respond with
that timeless creed

that sums up the
spirit of a people:

Yes, we can!
