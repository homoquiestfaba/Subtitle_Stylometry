When Your Legs Don't Work Like They Used To Before

And I Can't Sweep You Off Of Your Feet

Will Your Mouth Still Remember The Taste Of My Love?

Will Your Eyes Still Smile From Your Cheeks?

And Darling I Will Be Loving You 'Til We're 70

And Baby My Heart Could Still Fall As Hard At 23

And I'm Thinking 'Bout How People Fall In Love In Mysterious Ways

Maybe Just The Touch Of A Hand

Well, Meâ€”I Fall In Love With You Every Single Day

And I Just Wanna Tell You I Am

So Honey Now

Take Me Into Your Loving Arms

Kiss Me Under The Light Of A Thousand Stars

Place Your Head On My Beating Heart

I'm Thinking Out Loud

That Maybe We Found Love Right Where We Are

When My Hair's All But Gone And My Memory Fades

And The Crowds Don't Remember My Name

When My Hands Don't Play The Strings The Same Way

I Know You Will Still Love Me The Same

'Cause Honey Your Soul Could Never Grow Old It's Evergreen

And Baby Your Smile's Forever In My Mind And Memory

I'm Thinking 'Bout How People Fall In Love In Mysterious Ways

Maybe It's All Part Of A Plan

Well I'll Just Keep On Making The Same Mistakes

Hoping That You'll Understand

But Baby Now

Take Me Into Your Loving Arms

Kiss Me Under The Light Of A Thousand Stars

Place Your Head On My Beating Heart

Thinking Out Loud

That Maybe We Found Love Right Where We Are

So Baby Now

Take Me Into Your Loving Arms

Kiss Me Under The Light Of A Thousand Stars

Oh Darling Place Your Head On My Beating Heart

I'm Thinking Out Loud

That Maybe We Found Love Right Where We Are

Oh Baby We Found Love Right Where We Are

And We Found Love Right Where We Are
