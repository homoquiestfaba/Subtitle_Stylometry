<i>I wish I died that time</i>

<i>but</i>

<i>I'm still alive.</i>

Know a cafe named Venus?

<i>There's no reason to be in this town.</i>

<i>Likewise, there's</i>
<i>no reason to leave this town.</i>

<i>Day in day out,</i>
<i>every day is the same.</i>

Damn!

Drop dead, you drunkard!

<i>WIFE's shrieks</i>
<i>pierce my ears.</i>

<i>DOCTOR's stench</i>
<i>Is offensive to my nose.</i>

You good-for-nothing.

Ouch.

<i>SODA goes to work</i>
<i>at the florist.</i>

<i>A break in the</i>
<i>monotony, once...</i>

<i>BOY got</i>
<i>an old revolver</i>
<i>somewhere</i>

<i>and became</i>
<i>a self-acclaimed hit man.</i>

HIT MAN

<i>VENUS always sits</i>
<i>In the same place</i>

<i>and I'm always here</i>
<i>at the same time</i>

<i>to perform the same chores.</i>

You have tea?

What about cola?

COFFEE - VENUS BLEND

Coffee.

Venus Blend?

What else is there?

<i>I'm... stlll alive.</i>

<i>There's no meaning to it.</i>

<i>I'm not dead.</i>
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

Welcome.

There's only coffee

Two coffees.

Good morning, VENUS.

Good morning.

And...

Dirty ol' man.

And show me Venus's back.

Venus's back ...

Show it to me.

<i>I had almost forgotten</i>
<i>those words.</i>

<i>It is the time</i>
<i>when nameless people...</i>

Coffee.

<i>... live,</i>
<i>hiding names</i>
<i>they don't even have.</i>

And...

Please show me Venus's back

<i>It's the password</i>
<i>to the hideaway</i>
<i>Inside this old cafe.</i>

RULES FOR LONG-TERM GUESTS

Use it any way you want.

I'm CHONAN...

whatever you like.

No one uses his real name here.

It's GUY.

She's SAI.

How old are you?

Let her alone.

Meal's ready.

I'll have it later.

Mea 's downstairs.

Do you hear me?

I'm going out

SAI?

Is that the man?

How's his daughter?

Won't even answer.

Like her dear dad?

Better than the shrill here.

There's something
very manly about him...

You're womanly, too, WIFE.

How long must I earn money
with my womanly charms?

I think that's enough.

How can WIFE put up with you?

DOCTOR.

<i>Here,</i>
<i>we call each other</i>
<i>by names of no consequence.</i>

<i>If a name has</i>
<i>a meaning</i>
<i>or a hint of hope</i>

<i>that person will despair</i>
<i>because of that name.</i>

<i>Everyone here...is</i>
<i>well aware of that.</i>

<i>DOCTOR must have</i>
<i>a hard time</i>

<i>because</i>

<i>DOCTOR is no longer</i>
<i>a doctor.</i>

I kept your meal.

You went to find work?

Found an opening
at a construction site.

Daily laborer, huh?

That's hard work.

Do you have to do it everyday?

<i>It's not that</i>

<i>I'm trying to be</i>
<i>kind to SAI.</i>

<i>I just want her</i>
<i>to act normal.</i>

<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>it's too much of a hassle.</i>

Can't you stop that?

Damn you!

Another quarrel?

Wish it really was a quarrel.

He's clammed up.

Some quarrel, my ass.

I'm coming in.

Why don't you eat?

You're not among enemies

We I, not exactly friends, but...

Do you always wait for your dad?

I'm sure you can talk.

We're not your family and
you don't have to be friendly.

So...just eat.

It'll be a hassle

if you starve here.

The girl's eyes.

You used to have those eyes.

What do you mean?

Like "don't come close to me

but don't leave me a one."

Eyes saying that.

Her heart is not locked.

But she doesn't know how to open it.

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she means any trouble.</i>

Come with me.

There's lots more.

WIFE.

All well with DOCTOR?

Why ask?

Don't hear shouts recently.

We're not kids.
We don't quarrel everyday.

C'mon

We don't.

Then you two are happy together.

Must be the sex, huh?

Shut up.

WIFE and DOCTOR go beyond
such things.

I guess it's impossible here
with those paper-thin walls.

C'mon, eat more.

CHONAN.

Won't SAI eat with us?

Clothes in the basket.

Laundry service.

It's free of charge.

Hey.

The shower won't get
the booze out of my system, will it?

Why...

Why did you come here?

Why are you here?

Probably because I'm
an utterly good-for-nothing person.

I got you.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

I'll be ready soon

It's DOCTOR and WIFE.

I think WIFE's crying.

It's out of question.

He told me to get out

Never told you that.

I could leave.

What is this, anyway?

Why do you clam up?

Why are you dissatisfied?

I earn enough money...
and we have a decent life

Do you realize what I have to
go through to earn money?

I do it all for you.

Who pays for your drink s?

WIFE.

I am so disappointed.

What's going on?

This is what's going on.

I knew this was going to happen.

Does she

want to be with me?

That's why she's here

and gets angry.

Maybe she's unaware that
she doesn't want to be with me.

I don't think

she'll be happy here.

Say something.

She shouldn't be here.

That's for her to decide.

I think she's unable to decide.

I'm a hopeless loser...

But she's such a sweet creature.

He used to be a good doctor

About a decade ago

everyone in this neighborhood
relied on him.

He was such a good-natured man,
and never refused any patients.

Why did he quit?

Because of his error

during an operation
He crippled a patient for lif e.

He's absolutely convinced of that.

It really wasn't an error.

It wasn't all his fault.

The only one blaming him is himself.

And...he quit it all.

I don't know
what he's depressed about.

People are

so sensitive to their wounds

but not to wounds of others.

How's SAI?

She's eating now.

You're keeping her company?

No, I get her to help me
to lighten my work load.

<i>When someone's heart</i>
<i>opens up a bit</i>

<i>someone else's heart</i>
<i>begins to close.</i>

Tell me what's wrong

Thank you.

Can I have one?

A woman should think of her child.

You're an old-fashioned person.

Don't worry.

My body, fortunately,
is no longer good for that.

If we had kids, I'm sure
things would've been different.

How do you like this town?

Guess you don't.

City is where you cannot live in.

Home is where you cannot go back to.

Drifting north and further north...

tossed here and there...

This is the town you reached.

This place

is inhabited by drifters
with reasons of their own.

It's a strange place

Because of that,
we can be redeemed at times.

It smells of cigarettes.

What does SAI look like
when she smiles?

If someone's existence
is like a pair of shackles

it makes everyone unable to move.

Such a life is no good.

I'm in your way?

It's over?

It was long over.

You can't decide that.

You shouldn't be here.

Go somewhere.

Find someone stronger than me.

Go? Go where?

To someone like GUY.

SAI...

How long are you going to eat here?

Let's eat together. C'mon, just once.

SAI.

You, too, VENUS.

Let's eat.

<i>Seelng SAI</i>
<i>surrounded,</i>
<i>WIFE smiled...</i>

<i>And after that,</i>
<i>she went out</i>
<i>and did not return.</i>

<i>Romance is perhaps</i>
<i>what you</i>
<i>want to enjoy.</i>

<i>Love is perhaps</i>
<i>what you don't</i>
<i>want to lose.</i>

<i>But it's not</i>
<i>that simple.</i>

<i>It's hard to believe</i>
<i>there was never</i>
<i>any lo ve between DOCTOR and WIFE.</i>

SAI.

One more chore from today.

Be careful.

I've been itchng to ask you.

Ever killed anyone?

Not yet.

There's always the first time.

Asked DUSTER to pass me a contract.

Hey, I'm not a kid.

I'm all grown-up now.

But most aren't hit men.

Because they're all wimps

I'm the strongest man on earth.

Doesn't suit you.

No one will seriously hire you.

A hit man has

an air like him.

Your SAI...

I sometimes borrow her.

For laundry service.

She smiled a bit.

Don't meddle with us.

Do you enjoy it?

What's manly about him?

Why're you here?

To buy flowers.

Do you work here?

Yes, I do.

Was that your boyfriend?

Take care of this.

Give this to her.

Tomorrow's her birthday.

To SAI?

Give it to her yourself.

She smiles. Right?

She smiles in front of you,
doesn't she?

Please give it to her.

It's for you.

A gift from GUY.

Now I get it.

Get what?

Came to buy that yesterday.

GUY... I'm so sorry.

No need to apologize.

He's right, CHONAN
Why apologize to him?

You need that?

For my job

Your job?

That's dangerous.

Of course it is. It's a dangerous job.

I earn a decent living.

So?

I don't like that.

Don't meddle with
other people's affairs. Right?

No wonder she hates you.

BOY.

Don't take your frustration out on me.

I'll blow you away.

I'll blow you away.

BOY.

It was more than 10 years ago.

A woman came here with her little son.

She ordered coffee, and...

before we knew it,
she disappeared. Just like that.

She left her son, and took off.

She never returned.
It's so typical of this town

The boy kept waiting
for his mother's return.

If he stopped waiting he'd have to
admit he was abandoned.

But the fact is he was abandoned.

The boy blamed himself.

He thought it was because
he was weak.

He thought

his mother would return,
if he became strong.

He said he wanted to be strong.

He still doesn't know
what it is to be strong.

Such a foolish boy ...

Hurry up

Hurry what?

The contract.

I'm already for it.

You're not joking?

I never joke.

I'm ready to blow away any target.

Just get me a contract.

Welcome home.

Ah ...I'm home.

You didn't drink before.

I guess I drank too much... Good night.

CHONAN.

Been here many years?

Three years.

Would that be long?

Or would it be short?

<i>It's hard to tell.</i>

<i>My time stopped moving</i>
<i>long ago.</i>

CHONAN

Isn't SAI here?

Hey, lets chat.

That flower

in the pot you broke

is called anemone.

It means "wind"

because its petals quickly
fall when wind blows.

It's not really true.

Do you know why?

Anemone seeds fly far, far away,
riding the wind.

The seeds will try to
start a new life somewhere

and they will

try to bloom at whatever odds.
They don't give up easily.

Wish I could be like anemone

What about anemone?

Sorry. I overheard a bit.

I wasn't talking for SAI.

I was saying it to myself.

Why are you here?

Won't do much good anyway

I have a dream.

I'm here to realize that.

For a flower shop?

Oh don't make me blush.

Open my own shop someday

and fill it with my favorite flowers.

Have all kinds of flowers
in people's homes.

That'll be great

To realize that, I can bear anything.

Why a flower shop?

Where I grew up, no flowers bloomed.

The manager said
I could be supervisor someday.

Hope it comes true.

Me, too.

You know...

I'm just here.

No reason to be any where else

so I'm just here.

Don't mind being alive

but being dead may not be so bad.

I don't get it.

Guess you don't.

You're doing great.

Oh, c'mon.

TO MISS LAUNDRY SERVICE.
SORRY IT'S LATE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
