Well, can you see anyone you know?

Yeah.

That's you.

Will my picture go up there too?

It's up to you.

My part is now done.

You are on your own now.

The others are waiting for us.

<i>(Swears)</i>

Unwrap this, Oskari.

It should have a red cross on it.

Yeah.

That is our secret.

A place with guaranteed game.

Are there deer in there?
Absolutely.

Gorgeous horned ones.

Good. I know how to call them.

Rest well -

and wait until the morning.

Remember to move under the wind.

And when the sun rises -

it's the best moment.

It's when you need to be ready to shoot.

Dad?

I'll do my best.

Good. You should.

Fuel tap.

There you go. Show them.

<i>(Swears)</i>

Come on! -

all the way!

The boy will go home.

No he won't. The boy is ready.

You'll give the speech like you normally would
and you'll send the boy into the forest.

Well, fine then.
You're the one who will get embarrassed.

Good.

Men!

This little man has hunter's blood
running through his veins.

The boy is now standing in front of men -

like each one of you has once stood.

Ready to continue the tradition.

The boy has one day and one night -

to find out what he is made of.

In the morning he will bring us
what the forest sees fit.

The forest is a harsh judge.

It will give everyone adequately.

You need to know how to listen to it.

You need to fight tooth and nail for the prey.

You will get nothing for free.

The one who enters the forest is a boy -

but the one who returns will be.. -

a man.

Testing, testing

One, two, three

Is there anyone there?

<i>Happy Birthday
-DAD</i>

The forest is a harsh judge.

It will give everyone adequately.

You need to know how to listen to it.

You need to fight tooth and nail for the prey.

You will get nothing for free.

The boy is lost.

Goddamnit. Didn't I warn you?

<i>(Swears)</i>

What the hell?

It's my boy!

Dad. This is..

Bill.

Goddamnit, Oskari!

Damn, it's the same guy all right.

Say Cheese.
