THE PERFECT HOST
Subtitle by: green_towel

Hello?

Hi, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

I'm new to LA, and I..

..was on my way to see a buddy of mine 
whom I'll be staying with..

..and I was just mugged. They took my
phone, my wallet, and I was actually injured in the process.

I saw your sign of Jehova in your window 
and I was just wondering if I could possibly come in..

..and use your phone and just kind of collect myself.
I know what this must look like.

You follow Jehova then?

Yes yes, and you can imagine how pleased I was
when I saw an insignia in your window.

But you don't wear the cross?

No, unfortunately it was ripped from my neck
during the mugging.

Perhaps you'll receive another next Christmas.

I don't understand, I'm a Christian?

You may well be, 
but you certainly don't follow Jehovah.

We don't celebrate Christmas and we certainly 
don't acknowledge the cross. Wolf.

Dear Warwick, Here in sunny
Sidney, loving it..

Love, JuliaXX.

Yes?

Ah yes, is this Warwick?

Warwick, yes.
Who is this?

Hi Warwick, It's John,
I'm a friend of Julia.

She's not here right now.

Yeah, I know, I actually just left her in Sydney.

Oh, really?

Wha.. What I can do for you?

Well, I'm in a bit of a bide actually, erk..

I just arrived back in the country, 
and the airport lost my luggage

and on top of everything else I was mugged.

Oh my God.

Yeah yeah and I planned on staying with
my cousin and now nobody's home.

Yes...?

Well, look, I wouldn't normally do
something like this, but ...

... you know, but Julia just kept on and on 
about what a great person you are,

and I was gonna call you anyway, so
I just sort of thought that ...

Umm.. I just thought that maybe I could come in
and make some other arrangements.

You, you're sort of my last resort.

Look, I.. I like to help you out, but ...
I'm expecting people for dinner.

You, you'd really.. You'd going to do me
a big favor.

I'm sorry.

Okay, no hard feelings.
Maybe another time.

John?
Yes.

I'm sorry, Julia would never forgive me.
Of course you can come in.

You must be exhausted. Hi, I'm Warwick.
John.

Can I get you something to drink?
Mineral water? Wine?

Yeah, some wine would be great.

Red or white?
Red.

Thank you.

Here you go.

Thank you.

Great place.
Thank you.

Please have a seat.

Okay, thanks.

So how was Australia.
Oh, it's great, yeah.

It's really beautiful you know. Beaches were amazing,
I wish I could've stayed longer.

Travel. One of life real pleasures.

Yeah it is, isn't it, yeah.

So,what do you do when you're
not traveling?

00:12:17 ,190 --> 00:12:20,689
Ah, I double this and that, you know.

I don't feel like I really value much you calling it.

We all have so many choices
these days, don't we?

So? How's Julia?

She's good. Yeah. Really really good.

How's she feeling about going back to
to work?

Fine, fine.
That's surprising.

Last time we talk, she was thinking
about leaving.

You know, she isn't really talk about it
that much, so I don't know.

Well, who can blame her, I couldn't do
that kind of work. Could you?

No, no I couldn't.

Listen, I need to keep an eye on dinner.
Do you wanna ...?

Oh, yeah sure.

So, have you lived here long?
A while.

Do you live alone?

I do.

Guess you'll be needing the phone.

You said you had to make arrangements.

Thank you.

It's me.
I'll call you back.

No luck?
No.

Carrot?
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

I hate to ask this, is there any way i could hang out
another half hour or so..

..I think my cousin should be home by then.

I know I'm putting you out, I'm so sorry.
It's just been one of those days.

Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. Just sit down, relax,
We'll sort this out.

Tell you what, I'll call the airport.
We'll see if we can locate your luggage.

Oh, I wou..I wouldn't worry about that .

I left the airport all my cousin's information.
and they said they would call him, so..

Your cousin isn't home, is he?
She.

She's not home.

Listen, if you don't stand on top of these people,
you'll be the last one to receive anything.

What airline were you on?
Qantas.

Can you give me Qantas lost luggage at LAX, please.

Yes, hello. I'm checking on some luggage.
Hang on.

Do you have the baggage's receipt?
No, it was in my wallet - stolen.

No, he doesn't.
What's your last name?

Jones.

John Jones?

My parents..

It's Jones.
Not very creative.

Yes, from Sydney.

Sure.

I see.
They don't have anything out of Jones.

What's it look like?

What?
Your luggage, describe it for me.

Hang on a second.

A black bag, mid size, had a little red ribbon
tied on the handle.

Okay, if I describe the luggage, will that ...

And when will he be back?

This person obviously doesn't want to deal with me.
Don't worry about it, just hang up.

Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

He says his supervisor will be back in
an hour, you sure your cousin will be home?

I don't, I don't even know, she's not expecting me,
I was gonna surprise her.

This is becoming far too difficult.

What if you stay for dinner?

We can call the supervisor
in an hour or so. What do you think?

I think that's a great idea. Thank you.

Okay, look, I'll call you back.
Okay. Thank you. Yes.

Well, that's all settled.

Now, I need to get ready,
You make yourself at home.

There's more wine in the kitchen if you like.
And, I won't be a moment.

John?
Yeah.

Tell me, I have to know everything that you and
Julia did in Sydney.

Don't leave out any details.

Ah, we just sorta hung out.

How did you meet?

Through a mutual friend.

I met her at a birthday party.

But you've spent some time together.
Yeah, it was just.. It's more toward the end of the trip.

Look, I wished I could've hung out with her longer, you know.
She's such a sweet girl.

And, she suggested you visit me?

Yeah, she actually thought we'd get along.
That is so Julia.

But strange too.
What is?

I spoke to her few days ago, she didn't mention you.

Very strange, maybe she's just forgot.

Oh, that unlikely, she used to
tell me everything. It's just odd she didn't..

..mention you at all.

I hope she mention me
the next time you guys talk.

You know, you're right, let's give her a call.

I'll get the phone.

I'm sure Julia would love to know 
we're both here together.

I think it's about 9 o'clock in the morning, Sydney time.
She should be up.

You know what? I think she's been doing
yoga on Wednesdays.

I don't.. I don't even know if she'll be there.

But it's not Wednesday. It's Wednesday here, 
but it's Thursday morning over there, right?

You're right. Of course it is, they're 
a day ahead of us.

It's Thursday.

It's ringing.

Answering machine.

Hi Jule, It's me, I'm here with John.

Who waves hello. Yes. He had a nightmare journey.

I wish you had told me he was coming.
I could've prepare it. Anyway..

..I hope you're well, give me a call
when you can. Bye.

She must still be asleep.
Listen, I've gotta keep cooking.

Make yourself comfortable.
My guests should be here soon.

You okay?
I'm good.

Where's your restroom?
Oh, it's down here, come here.

It's right down the hall, second door
on the left.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

What's wrong? You're limping.

Ah, I sprained my ankle. And, it's still
look kinda healing.

Oh no, sprained ankle.
That's no good, John.

You weren't drunk, were you, John?

Come on, admit it.

I've been watching you (?) into the
red tonight.

I'm one of the white man myself.

Red a bit heavy for my constitution.
A bit too rustic.

Plus, it stained the teeth.

Have you ever been to Romania?

Romania drink a lot of red wine. They all
have red teeth. 

Or maybe they eat a lot of red meat,
I don't know, but got red teeth

That's the Romanians.

Magnificent.

So, who else coming tonight?

Some old friends.

What do they do?

Well, one is an artist, a journalist,
a lawyer.

A lawyer?

Yes. Roman.
Brilliant.

I keep telling him, he should change
sides, start his own practice..

..it'll make more money, but he won't do it.
He's got principles.

So what is he? A tax attorney?

God, no. He's a prosecutor. He works for
the District Attorney's Office.

Very talented.

You've planned a really nice dinner.

And, I.. I'm exhausted.
I think I'm gonna go.

I'm just, I'm so tired.

Yeah, and I think my cousin should be
home now.

No, no. Don't be ridiculous.
I can't send you out there homeless.

Oh, there's somebody at home. I just don't want to ruin your dinner.

I'm exhausted. I'm tired. Look, I'm no way near interesting
as the guests you're gonna be having.

I'm gonna go.

No, sit down, sit down. Listen.
This is an informal dinner.

Little wine, relax conversation,
you don't have to do a thing.

My guests are very amusing.

Trust me.
You'll be captivated.

Really.

So, what time.. what time everything getting started.

Well, it suppose to be at 8, but as
usual, they're probably be late.

<i> ...an arm robbery took place including a
$300,000..</i>

That's not really difficult to be punctual.

Set your watch towards it, make lists.

It's not that difficult.

Warwick, could you be quiet
for just one second, please?

It's planning. Plain and simple.

Time management.

-It's..
-Shut the fuck up!

I beg your pardon?

Look, you might be a friend of Julia,
but I won't be spoken to that way.

I think maybe you better leave.

There's your fucking Julia.

..still searching for a man probably responsible
for a daring bank robbery this afternoon..

One of the bank employee identified the man as
Los Angeles resident, John Taylor.

Taylor walked into a suburban branch
of the first National,

hold up the teller and walked away
with an estimated take of $300,000.

Taylor has prior convictions for both
assault and armed robbery.

He was last seen exiting
a convenient store in Silver Lake.

Police advices that Taylor is extremely
dangerous and should not be approached.

In other news, the Commissioner of police
corruption availed his plan..

Sit down.

Sit down!

I don't mind if you smoke.

Do you mind if I smoke?

You can't kill me, I'm having a dinner party.

I will cut your throat, put you
in the bathtub, I'll eat all your food..

and I'll sleep in your bed.

Do you understand that?

I want you to get on the phone. I want you to
call your homo friends and tell them to fuck off.

Okay.

Hello Rupert, it's me. Yes, i know you're late but..

00:25:21,3  46 --> 00:25:23,907
It doesn't matter now, I have to cancel.

I have a.. I have a terrible migraine.

Yeah, could you call the
others and apologize for me?

Thanks. No, no. That's okay.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

Good boy.

Oh my God.

You.. You're bleeding.

I can take care of it .. No, no please please.
Let me just.. And some water.

Ohh, good.

What the fuck are you doing?

Cleaning up your nasty mess.

I'm not fucking around, do you 
understand me?

Do you understand me?

Any up-to-date?
Oh, yeah.

You must be devastated.

Yeah, but I'll get over it.

Man, it was brutal.
We're 5 games in those season.

I hope you didn't have any money on it.

That would be illegal.

Right.

What is that?
Witness statements.

We have a lead witness, already?

Yeah, the bank teller. She's the one who ID'ed Taylor.

Says Taylor, come around those other occasions.

Really?

Taylor doesn't has an account, he just like the look
of her apparently.

He asked her out at least 3 times.

He took her number and never called.
John stop coming around.

Until today.

It's his home phone number.

My feeling is, either he's an idiot or.. 

the romantic angle was a cover to
case the bank.

Well, he's an idiot either way.

You don't give somebody your number
and then robbed them.

He did wear a wig and sunglasses.

That was cunning.

Why'd you do it?

Do what?

Steal.

Why not earn it honestly?

I doesn't matter to me. I.. I'm  just curios.

There's always a way to earn money.

Yeah?

What fuck do you know about everything?

I'm just saying, you know.

Stealing is not the answer.

Okay, here's how this gonna go.

I'm gonna kill you.

That's the decison I've already made.

But if you're smart,
you might be able to change my mind.

For starters, you can keep your
ignore-ass opinions to yourself.

Because you don't fucking know me.

And also, you can follow my instructions,
and stay out of my way until morning.

You won't get hurt.

You just be my accommodations for the evening.

Okay?

Got it?

I told them I was preparing duck.

They knew tonigh was special.

They should be here.

They're so unreliable.
I'm always on time for them.

I'm always on time.

I was start having extreme phone call.
Don't worry. We're running late.

I'm so sorry, Warwick,
we're feeling tired, we can't make it.

It's a cheeky little drop, isn't it?

Well, Rupert and I have seen it twice.
I can't wait for them to be on DVD.

Why don't you see them?
Really, you have to go.

That's very good Rupert. You're quite the mimic.

John.

Excuse me.

Monica, how are doing there?
Excuse me, Rupert.

Sorry about that.

Everybody. Everybody.

This is our new friend, John.
Everybody say hello to John.

Hello John.

You drifted off there for a moment.

Are you alright?
We were worried about you.

Yes, we were.

Were what?
Were worried about you.

Just fuck your hand off me, you freak!

Fuck you!

Manners.

You were hungry, Rupert.
Shovel it down you little piggy.

So, Roman.

Frying any good cases recently?

I'm sure John wil be interested in the judicial process.

You know I can't discuss that, Warwick.

It not ethical.

Oh, come on. It just us.
And these 4 walls.

Yes, now, that's very boring, Roman.

After all we have a
real criminal right here at our own table.

So, you're new to LA, are you John?

Yes, he just flying from Sydney, Australia.

Good day, mate.
Hey, Chelsea, Chelsea please.

Please control yourself.

Monica and I went to that Caravaggio 
exhibition, last week?

Oh, yes, how was it?

Amazing.

They only had a few pieces, but they fixed two
separate light sources to each painting.

One would fade, the other would come up.

Yes, it illuminated the paintings surreal - details, staggering.

I don't think I know Caravaggio.

You're kidding.

When did he painted?
Well, around 1600.

It's quite an interesting character, actually.

He was legitimate and a murderer.

Was he?
Well, yes, yes. But fascinating, besides that ...

He put most of today criminals a shame.

Sounds frightening.

I'm sure I have a book on him somewhere. Hang on.

I'll see if I can find it.

Here it is.

Oh, my god. Chelsea.

John. John!

Yes, I know, poor kitten. Here.

Are you going to apologize to Chelsea?

Excuse me?

You knocked her down and then you trampled her.

Well?

I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

So John, what's new and interesting?

What's new is that I'm sitting here 
with a fucking lunatic.

Nothing interesting about that.

I've had darker days than this, Warwick.

Look at this.
You'll like this.

This is midnight.

You know, Roman, I think I'm finally starting 
to capture your alikeness.

And the finale.

Don't be threat.
The place for you on every page.

Where's the history of this stuff?

What do you mean? Like..
For the month. Tapes from the whole month.

Whatever they had, we've got downstairs.

Okay. Call the property room. Tell them to come in down.

You are the most beautiful creature I've ever laid eyes on.
You're exquisite.

I'm sure you told all the girls that.

You're such a lady's man.

It's different with you. You're special.

How can I believe that?

That's true. There've been many women
traveled the road to Warwick,

Interesting road indeed.

I can't be blame.
For the love I've shared.

I know, but what about Julia?

She's in Australia.
But you're with her, she is..

She is..

She is the ship of the night
A child of the loving universe,

My heart (?) pointed at you.

This time it's bridle. Come to Warwick.

Warwick.

This is extremely boring, Warwick,
there are other people here you know.

Oh, I forgotten myself.

Is everyone not enjoying themeselves?

I can't speak for everyone here, but
I'm having a great time.

Warwick, don't we have the
last party on Super 8?

You're right, we do.
I'll show it to you. I'll show it to you.

Oh, Roman, come here. Give me a hand with John.

Right, ready?
1, 2, 3.

I wish you'd been here for this, you missed
the kicking party.

I did my own hair
and makeup.

It's so beautiful.
It's so beautiful.

Hey you.

Everybody's here. Everybody's here.

Rupert, keep these people occupied.
Or I'll keep you occupied.

Hello, Chelsea.

Isn't this great?

I was worried they was gonna get going
but this is fucking great.

You're having a good time?

Oh, lighten up, John, it's a party.

Well, he doesn't look very happy.

Oh, he just need to get into the festive spirit.

Hey, Chelsea, Rupert, come here. Come here.

Ready?
1, 2, 3. Champagne!

Hey, John.

Oh, yeah.
Almost time, isn't it?

Hope you feeling photogenic.

Warwick, can I join the conga line?

What?

Can I join the conga line?

I suppose we got a few more minutes.

But you have to drink a
cocktail if you want to be on time.

What's in it?
You want it, don't you?

Look, toughen you, I've gotta go
prepare for the photo in a second.

I'll drink it.

Hey Rupert, make a Midway for John.

Looks to me like you're pretty ripe, John. 
Conga!

John, look what you've done.
You've cause such a ruckus.

Hey you, I didn't even see you..
coming.

Yeah. I'm fantastic!
What? Yes, I love you.

Yes, I love you!
Say it again. Thank you.

You are been waiting for, huh?
Shake it.

Come on, shake it. Shake it.
Give it to me.

How much did you had a drink?
Get away from me! You're a whore.

Hey, how's it going?

Yeah. No, no.. it's more than I
expected, really. Yeah, It's a good turnout.

No, it's been great.
It's a great party.

Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Hold on.

Everyone, everyone.

So did you enjoy yourself?
Yes I did.

Sorry about Kelly and Adam, they sorta always
bring a possy with them whenever they come over.

Oh, it's fine.

So, am I staying here tonight?
Well, I always thought that you would.

Yeah?

So, you're not sick of me yet?

No. Not yet.
Good.

Oh, that reminds me..

It's okay, it's okay.

It's okay.

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

Yes.

Hello, Mr.Wilson, I'm sorry
I wasn't sure if you were here.

Your friend.. Are you alright?

He's fine. He's fine.
He's so little drunk.

He's been in character all evening.

What do you mean 'in character'?
We've just come from a costume party.

He just staying in character by
jumping into the pool.

You can see, it's.. becoming very tiresome.

I thought he may have be in pain from the sound he was making.

Well, I did tell him not to mix his liquors.

I'm so sorry we disturbed you.

But I think we're winding down now.
I promise you there won't be anymore noise.

Well, if you're sure everything's alright.
Yes, thank you, I'm so sorry.

You'll have to excuse me.
Okay. I'll let you go.

Okay. Take care.

It's okay, you just had too much to drink.
I'm sorry, is there something else?

Are you sure he's alright?

He seems to be trying to pull his mask off.

Thank God! I've been trying to get him to
do that all night.

He's really very drunk, I think maybe it's time
for him to go to bed, and me too.

So. if there nothing else..

I guess not.
Okay. Alright. Well then..

Good night.
Good night.

Good night.

Good night.

Off to bed with you, young man.

What if she goes and calls the police now, Warwick?
What you're going to do?

Warwick probably just breakdown.

He's not the most
masculin man in the world.

Shut up!

-We really got to thinking about this now..
-The next time someone come in..

Shut up!

You know what you really should be concern about Warwick - it's his foot.

I think it needs some attention.

Attention? Yes.

I'll stop your mangle and bleeding foot from
dripping on my floor..

once and for all.

It's not covered.

I told you that already.

There isn't an elective procedure?
Baby, it's gonna be okay.

It's not okay. It's a fucking joke.

Can you even go to work tomorrow?

Yeah, I'll be fine.

You can't keep taking those.

Those painkiller if you keep putting those in your body
your liver gonna shut down.

Okay, doctor.

This is fucking miserable.

We've gotta get some money.

No.

Alright, come here.
Please, baby, just come here.

You're not gonna steal any money.

It's just not gonna happen.

I've tried it before.

Yeah, you went to prison for it.

I'm not going back.

It's gonna be okay.

These are both are pretty good.

I can't decide.
Which do you prefer?

I've to decide later.

Why'd you do it to me?

Nice move, Roman.

Warwick. Warwick please listen to me.
I'm listening.

Please don't do this, Warwick.

Okay?

Please just let me go.

Warwick, I'll do anything.

Warwick.
I wouldn't do that, Roman.

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, John.

What?

That's physics.

It's nature's law.

Oh, sweetheart.
No tears.

What I can do
to make it better?

Please let me go.

Just please don't kill me.

You are my guest,
and I'm glad you're here.

But you've only got yourself to blame.

So, where is she now?

Who?

Julia.

She's in Bangkok.

She might be going to Hanoi, she
hasn't decided yet.

Who hasn't decided?

Julia.

Who's that?

That's the girl you met in Australia, silly.

I've never been to Australia, Warwick.

You mean you lied?

Yeah. Yeah, I lied.

Doesn't say much for your character.

And you're Julia, Warwick.

What?

You're Julia.

Roman, Rupert, and Monica..

It's all you, Warwick.

As fascinating as this is John, I do have others to attend to.

I can't be an ungracious host.

Anyone for a final cocktail?

Monica? Oh, right I forgot.
Which you prefer? Dessert wine? Coffee?

Suit yourself.
Rupert?

Save the bottle for Roman.

So what now?

Now it's quite time, John.
That means..

Time to reflect. That means being quite, alright?

It sound very entertaining.
I mean, I'm still your guest, aren't I?

Of course you are.

Well?

What do you have in mind?

Wait..

If you win, I'll grant you your freedom.

But what do I get when you lose?

You've got my life, isn't that enough?

Can't give you much more than that, Warwick.
Yes, that's true.

But I already have that.

Have you ever play chess before?

Yeah, once or twice.
Okay.

When you wanna move, you've need tell me which letter and..

corresponding number.

For example if you wanna move your bishop, you'll say..

Bishop to king 3.

Now if have to move my rook, I'll go to knight 7.

Okay, so what's the best
strategy?

Well, that's the thing. I mean, we don't control your
opponent's pieces, you only control your own.

But if you know your opponent, and you know
his weaknesses..

and you planned right, then you can influence
your opponent behavior.

I see. So, if I listen to you and
I pretend to be fascinated..

and you think that you're teaching me chess,
then you would you make love to me?

Yeah, nice try. You can get that anytime.

You don't have to pretend to be interested.

What can you do for me?

What can you do?

Surely the satisfaction of winning should
be enough for a man like you.

No.
"To the victor goes the spoils."

How would you spoil me, John?
I don't know, Warwick How would you like me to spoil you?

Let me think.

King.
Yes.

Although the entire game revolves around
the king..

It's the least powerful piece on the board.

See, it's movements are limited. It can only 
go to here.. Do this.. One at a time.

Sometimes, the pawn is more important.

It's the most ordinary piece on the board.

It's simplest in function,
but if you use it properly..

can be absolutely devastating.

It may look like you have the upper hand.

but if you're not paying attention,
then your opponent can blindside you ...

And one move..

That's the beauty of this game.

I know what you can do for me
when you lose.

Yes.
My move, isn't it?

Yes, but listen.
Queen to G6.

Okay, so. When I win..
Checkmate.

What?

Checkmate.

How did that happen?

How did you manage to do that?

Come on Warwick, untie me.
But I had the perfect prize.

You said you would untie me
if I won, Warwick. Let's go.

You've played this before.
You cheated.

You're a fucking liar, Warwick.

I may be many things, John.
But one thing I'm not is a liar.

You're free to go.

You really are a worthless little man, aren't you, John?

You show no conviction, or fight at all.

You let me do whatever I
wanted to you. That's exactly what I did.

In fact, I even think you enjoyed it.

You're nothing.

John, you're disposable, forgettable..
A supporting player.

And nothing.

It's like you don't even existed.

Where are you going? John,
What are you doing?

John, put that down, John.
John, stop, please.

You treated me like an animal.

You've involved me in your
fuck up world.

You take away my dignity.

And you have the gall to say that
I'm nothing?

But it's true.

Hey, John.

Check out this piece of ass, huh?

Love me!

Love me!

Warwick, you know you need to take
two of those.

No, he doesn't.

He knows what he's doing.
Does he?

I know you like it,
you never know when to leave, Monica

but he needs to function
at work.

Morton, what are you doing?

Lieutenant, did I wake you?
No, I'm up.

You're early.
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

You've gotta want to see this.

Alright, come on.

Yeah, go on. Sit down.
I'll be right there..

Yeah, I'm positive now.

John Taylor had help with this.

One of the bank teller was in it with him.

Really?

Can I use your TV?
I don't have one.

Ah, I forgot.

Alright.

This is 3 weeks before the robbery.

Taylor comes in, fills up the deposit slips.

And cases the bank.
That's it.

How do you know that's Taylor?

The.. the tattoo.

It's him.

According to the teller, Simone De Marchi..

This woman.

according to Simone, John comes in
and asks her out.

But as you can see, 
he doesn't going anywhere near her for counsel.

Here's the robbery itself.
That's John waiting in line.

The teller asks him to come over.
He doesn't go. He let the customer behind him through.

He waits. Now, why did he do that?
Because he want Simone to serve him.

Exactly.

Now, she doesn't trip the sound of the alarm.

She isn't put the dypack in. She's getting more bills.

Well, she's in the back room. She could've done
anyone of this thing..

or let someone know.

She had every opportunity.
She does nothing.

And there's this. A couple month back,
She put in for 2 weeks vacation.

Guess when it start?
Today.

She lied about John coming on to her..

because she needs reason
to ID'ed him to us.

They're in it together.
Or if they were.

She keeps the money.
He gets caught.

Nice girl.

Got any lead on Taylor?

Well, if we follow Simone, we find Taylor.

You think he's gonna go after her?
When he find out what she did to him, yeah.

She's under surveillance?

Yeah, Valdez is taking out her place.

One of the bank employee identified the man as
Los Angeles resident, John Taylor.

I'm here to check on a reservation.
I'm meeting my wife at 9.

Just want to make sure
everything's booked.

 AMERICAN CAR RENTAL

Name?
Simone Pryer.

Yeah, It's booked. Ford Sedan.
9 am.

Thank you, have a good day.

If I listen to you and you and I
pretend to be fascinated..

You don't have to pretend to be interested.

Ah, yes. I'm conforming a reservation,
for this morning.

Sure, Los Angeles.

First name, Simone.

Nothing?

Okay. Thank you.

Simone Pryer.

No?
Okay, thank you.

You do? What location is this?

It's a 9 am pickup, correct?

8 o'clock?

It's gonna be okay.

What's happening?
Nothing, sir.

A light went on about
20 minutes ago.

That's something.

It still amazes me.
What's that?

These people. They've gotta know, there's no chance
they gonna get away with this.

If there is a way, someone will always gonna
try it. It's human nature.

That's not it. Something's wrong with their wiring. 
It's fucking their head.

Why can't they just get it together?

You'd be out of job
if they did.

Law enforcement is more than
a job, detective.

Okay, here she comes.

Do you know the real problem?
There's no deterrence.

Look at southeast Asia,

You spit in public in Singapore,
that's ground for arrest.

You get caught with drugs, that's death.

I mean, that's pretty extreme, isn't it?

Is it?

You check Singapore crime statistics.

People need to understand that
government is fucking serious.

The US is a liberal playground,
am I right?

Hey, she's turning.

Come on!

Move your car!
Shut up!

Move it!

Now she could be anywhere.

Should we keep going on?

You go up. I'll search the lower levels.

Okay.

Keep your radios on.

Unexpected?

Baby? I was so worried about you.

Don't.
What happened to your face?

Hey listen, I don't even know how'd you found me.

I mean, you don't have a cell.
I've been crazy, going out of my mind.

I've been freaked out. The cops are 
all over you.

I don't know what to do, I swapped cars.
I was gonna come pick you up, baby.

I'm so happy to see..

Looks like you're feeling better.

No pain this morning?

No, I still.. I mean..
Just stop.

Okay, Simone?

Why'd you do this?

Because you.. do it.

I do what?

It's the bank job. I don't even
have to persuade you.

What did you think? You're a
career criminal.

What'd you think was gonna happen?

I wanted to trust you.

Well, maybe we can still do.. I mean.. 
You know the truth now. We're not so different.

But what they do is they give the team a half.. a half ago.

..actually gonna make money on that.

You need me. You can't get across
the border. You can't do this without me.

..If you want to get joint with me on this,
I can get.. I know I can get us some better points out of it..

..You can join now. But the thing is
if you put our money on one of the team there..

Hello?

That's not enough to exit.

Give me the keys.

Morton, what's happening?

Lieutenant, we've got Simone. We
checked the car, she doesn't has the money.

No sign of Taylor.

Right.
We gonna take it down to the station.

Have you seen Taylor?

Not yet. You check the roof and
stairwells, and then you go on back.

I'll meet you there, I got some stuffs to attend to locally.

But you don't have a right, sir.
Like I said, it's local.

I'll call you if I need you.

Okay.

You didn't really think you're gonna 
get away with it, did you?

I swear to god if I get arrested,
I'm taking you down with me.

I can describe every single details
of your house.

I'm a police officer. You really think
anybody gonna believe you?

Yeah, I do.

You've got penance. I'll give you that.
Or you don't know how to hold your liquor.

So what now, Warwick?

Well, assuming you have the money,
I think we can come to an understanding.

Or I can simply shoot you
while you're trying to escape.

The thing is, you never shot anybody, haven't you?

Haven't I?

It's up to you. My detectives
will be down any minute.

The custom will be tough.
This will come in handy at the border.

Thanks.

No need to thank me, John.
You make things very entertaining.

Bon voyage.

Watch out!

I've been thinking about
John Taylor.

Oh yeah?
What about him?

At the parking garage. You were down there.
I'm amazed he got passed you.

Yeah, well. I guess I'm getting old.

I wonder where he went.

It's been a couple of months, he probably
crossed the country by now.

Or.. Or out of the country.

Could be.

Don't feel bad about this.
There's worse guy out there than Taylor.

And Simone De Marchi's trial coming up, right?

You did great work there.

You never met him before, right?
Taylor?

No.

Never?

Of course not, why?

I just thought your past might've crossed.
He's had conviction..

Maybe you've met him at the station.

And you never met him socially, right?

He's not exactly my crowd, detective.

Then..

This might come a little bit of a shock.

My God.

It's quite disturbing, isn't it?

I think technology's getting out of control.

What?
If a guy like Taylor..

can make something as professional
as this..

Wait. Are you suggesting that
Taylor manufactured this?

Of course.

This is a Polaroid. A positive
exposure. This isn't sound Photoshop markup.

It has to be, what other explanation
is there?

Besides the obvious one?

Ben, you've know for what?
10 years.

Six.
Six years.

Do you really think I would've associate
with this man?

I can't ignore it.

I'm sorry, Warwick. I have to has
this analyze.

Good. I like to know how he did it too.

The other thing is..
Yeah.

A witness came forward who said that Taylor
tried to break into a house on another robbery.

She said she saw him again the next
morning. Outside her neighbor's house.

That is your house.

Is this the lady who lives behind me?

Yeah.

Morton, do you know how many times that
woman called to this station?

The lady is bad-shit

Yeah. I know about her.

That's why we didn't take this
seriously. Until now.

Looks like it's been taken at your place.

It's a white couch. A white couch.

Why you? If this a fake, why
put you in the photograph?

He's mocking us.

So, where did he get your picture?

The paper. Last year Christmas party.

You are the one who showed me his file
is resourceful, right?

Tomorrow we'll be probably be looking on
a Polaroid of you and him

sitting together in a
fucking hottub.

Yeah.

Except..

Except what, Ben.

I've been fall if I didn't investigate this thoroughly.

And so you should.
You're a fine detective.

Now you'll have to excuse me.

I need to take a look
around your home.

Okay.

Okay, good.

You know.

Ben, I can appreciate your diligence.
Coming here to talk to me must've been tough.

but are you really gonna bring a sea
of cops over to my house?

Ignoring this is not the solution.
I agree.

So?

What do you have in mind?

How about dinner?

When?

You can come tonight. I already have some friends
coming over. I'm cooking.

It'll be fun. You can scour the place.

I already have something more official in mind.

I'm being civil, Ben.
I don't have to be.

I'd like to maintain our friendship.

Alright.

Dinner sounds good.
Great.

8 o'clock?
Sure.

Oh, and Ben..

You drink red or white wine?

Oh, red.

Fantastic.
