Have you ever wondered
how Nature gets its glow?

Who gives it light and colour as the
seasons come and go?

Who helps all creatures great and small...

to walk, to swim, to fly?

Who crafts such tiny details?

You might see them if you try...

For it's all the work of fairies, but
they stay well out of sight...

The first time that a baby laughs, a fairy's
life takes flight...

When the moon comes up to shine her face...

and the birds are fast asleep...

And the mountains hang from every post,

The fairies leave their keep!

They join their hands and sing their songs,

The mariners all can hear!

In the springtime when the earth is new,

The fairies might draw near!

The fairies might draw near!

TINKER BELL

Hello!
Hello?

Queen Clarion!

Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,
Happiness has brought you here!

Welcome to Pixie Hollow!

I trust you found your way alright!
I... think so.

Now let's see about those wings!

They will help you find your talent, little one.

But how will I know which one is...
You'll know!

I've never seen one glow that much before!
Even for Vidia!

You know, I do believe you're right! The little
lazy tod might be a very rare talent indeed!

Come forward, Tinker fairies and welcome...

the newest member of your talent kin... Tinker Bell!

I'm glad we had a bath today!
Coming through!

Make way for Tinkers! Hy-dy high,
hy-dy how, Miss Bell!

I'm Clank!
Clank, say it, don't spray it!

Amphilious T. Cattletree esquire, at your service!

Pleased to make your acquaintance!
Oh, boo... He's Boble, I'm Clank!

Clank, Boble!

We're pleased as a pair of perfectly polished
pots you're here!

Aaa... me, too!

Come on, miss Bell, there's so much to show you!

You've arrived at a most wonderous and
glorious time!

Really? Why?
It's almost time for the changing of the seasons!

You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year!

There's one up ahead!

Winter Woods, it's always cold here!

Look there! Snowflake and Frost fairies
returning home...

for some well-deserved rest!

We've just finished bringing winter to the world.

It's the up season for Autumn fairies, too.

Always practicing their perfect shade of amber, hey.

And the fairies of Summer still have plenty
of time to get ready!

Not as much as the Autumn fairies, of course, because...

Yes, Clank, because right now fairies of every
talent are preparing for my favorite season,

Springtime.

Get low, get low, little sproutings and dig.

Hello, there!
Come on, miss Bell, you've got to see where we live.

Welcome to Tinker's Nuke!

Come on, there's so much to show you.

Oh, cute.

Just taking some supplies down to the workshop.

Let her go.

Watch out for falling maple seeds!

Wow.

And over here is where most of us live!
There's your house, Tinker Bell!

Ah, it's mine?
Sure is.

We were hoping that your arrival would be
of one of us, so we got the place all ready.

We rounded up some work clothes!
We did not know your size!

Our apologies.
They might be too big!

That's only because you're so tiny.
Please come on down to the workshop when you're ready.

Fairy Mary will want to meet you.
Good bye!

Stop!
What?

Clank, I told you to take a seven.

You said five!
I said a seven!

Pretty!
So...

Pretty.

Who's that then?
It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain!

Wow, everyone seems so busy!

Spring won't spring itself.

Indeed my bellowing buddy and we Tinkers are
a big part of it.

Allow us to elucidate, miss Bell!

We fiddle and fix.
We craft and create.

We carve acorn buckets.
To hold flower paints.

With saddles and saches.
For birdies, you see.

We make baskets and bushels.
To carry the seeds.

We're preparing for spring.
We do all these and more.

Yes!
Because being a Tinker is never a bore.

That was great.
So you see, miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

Unfortunately, all those fairies are out of luck this year!

Unless we can actually deliver these things to them!

The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?
Yes, Fairy Mary.

They're top shaped.
No wheel is missing whatsoever.

Then let's see it!

Define seeing actually!
With your eyes!

You have to meet Tinker Bell!
What?

Who?
She's new, Fairy Mary.

Nice to meet you!
Oh, rapture! A new charge on whom we can
lavish all our...

tinkering wisdom and expertise!

Let me see those hands! Oh, so dainty!

Don't worry, dear! We'll build up those
Tinker muscles in no time!

Ok!
Now, boys, the deliveries!

We're on it! As a matter of fact, we're
heading out right this second!

But we've only got one wheel.
What was that?

Nothing really, Clank was just asking...
If...

I can go as well.
Yes!

I wondered that.
That's exactly what he was saying!

Very well, get on with it, then!

Slow down, Cheese. I can't keep up!

The mouse's name is Cheese?
It must be! He always comes when we yell it!

Sprinting thistles!

Aaa!

Easy! Easy, boy!

It's alright, Fawn's got you!

Easy, easy girl, it's alright, Silvermist's got you!

Oh, you alright, sugar cake?
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

Elevate her legs!
No, wait, I mean her head.

Wait, wait, if she's red, raise the head,
if she's pale, raise the tail.

Does she look pale or red?
She looks squished!

Sorry.
Here, let me, rain drop! So...

what happened to you, anyway?

Well...
It was sprinting thistles!

Those weeds are an absolute mess! Always trapping
things, poking people in the petunia!

Gather around, ladies!

We've brought some selections from the new
spring line of Tinkers' specialities!

Alright!
Show us!

Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa!
Finally!

Silvermist, could you help me?

Wow, what are you going to do with that?
I'm gonna take it to the Mainland.

What's the Mainland?
It's where we are going to change winter to spring.

The seasons change all the time there.

I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

And I'll have breakfast ready for all the
little fuzzies coming out of hibernation.

We just follow the second star...

We ride the breeze, we follow the waves...

All the way across the sea.
Then, there it is.

Wow! The Mainland sounds flitterific!

Yes, the glamorous lives of the Nature talent fairies!

We'd love to stay and chat...
But we Tinkers have real work to do!

We know. Don't we like that!

Nice to meet you all.
You, too! Bye! Later!

Right, here we are... a pretty
large order of pollen pots for...

The last thing is...
Is it ok if I just catch up with you later?

I suppose.
Can you find your way back?

Yeah, yeah, sure I can.

Alright then.
Just be careful!

Hi, there... sorry...

Vidia, right?

We didn't officially meet. I'm Tinker Bell.

Oh, yes, the new girl.
That's right.

So, what's your talent?
What do you think it is?

You're a poleniser?

Polenator? Polen-picker? Polenflucker?

I am a fast flying fairy. A true rare talent.

And this is but a small part of what I do.

I make breezes in the summer. I blow down leaves
in the fall. My winds even brought you here, dear.

Fairies of every talent depend on me.

Hey, that's just like what I do.
Excuse me?

I mean Tinkers help fairies of every talent, too, so...

We're kind of the same, you know?

Sweetie, I make forces of Nature.

You make pots and kettles.

I work up in the sky and you work down in a ditch.

Hey!
Don't get me wrong, sunshine!

Being a tinker is really swell and all,
but I wouldn't go...

around bragging about your talent! It's
not like spring depends on you!

Of course it does! And when I go to the Mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are!

When who goes to the Mainland?
Me, of course!

For spring!
Oh, of course!

You'll prove it, huh?
Yes, I will..

Well, I for one, am looking forward to that.

Excuse me.

No, excuse me.

Mine is a rare talent!

A!

Don't tell me Tinkers don't matter.

I'll show her what rare talent really is when I'll...

Hey, Tink. What you got there?
Oh, hi.

I don't know, I just found them.
Lost things.

Uuu, lost things!

Hey, stuff gets lost and washes up on
Neverland from day to day.

You know, from the Mainland.
These come from the Mainland?

That place sounds more fascinating all the time.

Fairy potions, checked! Polen pots, checked!

Lost things, checked!

Lost things? Why are you fiddling with that junk?

They were just so... unusual!

You should not be wasting your time with that rubbish.

And I won't have it cluttering up my workshop.

And as for you two... No more
dilly-dallying around!

And don't forget about the queen's
review tonight. Goodness!

There's still so much to be done! Thank you!

Sorry about your trinkets, miss Bell.

Well, we best be getting ready for the review, anyway.

What is the queen's review?
You see, the queen...

is going to review all the preparations for spring.

It is a good time for us Tinkers to show what we can do, hey?
Indeed!

Really?
Like me, I can be a wheel!

Perfect.

That's my chance.

Ok, everybody, turn! Ready for the phase code over here!

A, splendid, splendid.

There's plenty of time before the queen arrives.

A! It's the queen!
What? She's here? Now?

Play, Music fairies.

Play.

Queen Clarion, your illustriousness,
as minister pf spring.

I welcome you to Springtime Square.

What? No fireworks, minister?
A, well, that could be arranged!

Light fairies, light fairies.
I'm teasing you.

You always make such a fuss and everything
turns out wonderfully.

Well, I think that you'll find that
we have things well in hand.

The ever-blossom blooms will be ready to
bring spring to the Mainland.

Music to my ears.

I know you all put in months of practice
and preparation.

But keep up the good work these last few days
because just as fairies...

Queen Clarion! Queen Clarion!

Did I miss anything?

No, no, no.
Good.

It's alright.

I came up with some fantastic things for
Tinkers to use when we go to the Mainland.

Let me show you.

First, baby chipmunks can't eat the whole
nut, right?

Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

So, you just crank back this lever and its...

Ups...

It's kind of a work in progress!

Yes, yes, yes, very clever.

Oh, and I made this, too. It's a flower-sprayer.

Tinker Bell, I...
Allow me to demonstrate!

Sorry!!!

But, but, wait till you see this last one!
Tinker Bell!

Sweetheart, has no one explained?

Explain what?

Tinker fairies don't go to the Mainland, dear.
What?

All of those things are done by the Nature talent fairies!

Your work is here, in Pixie Hollow!

But... but I thought that...
I'm sorry, Tinker Bell!

Ok, no, no, that's good!

I mean I couldn't make it, anyway, so...

Good, this actually works out good.

I mean well, so I...

I'm just gonna... yeah.

Back so soon?

You didn't go?
Goodness, no.

Far too much work to do down here!

Vidia was right.

Being a Tinker stinks!
Excuse me?

It's just that... why don't we get
to go to the Mainland?

Oh, the Mainland?

Who gives a pile of pebbles about the Mainland?

But Fairy Mary, the other fairies get to go.

Now, Tinker Bell, are you a garden fairy?

Well, no.
Are you a light fairy?

No.
Animal fairy?

Water fairy perhaps?
No and no.

No, you're not. You are a Tinker.
It's who you are.

Be proud of it.

The day you can magically make the flowers grow,

or capture the rays of the sun, then you can go.

Until then your work is here.

Good idea, Fairy Mary.

Here you go, Silvermist.
Thank you, Terrence.

Oh, I hope Tinker Bell is ok.
I know that, poor little sapling.

She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

I wouldn't blame her is she stayed in bed all day.
Good morning, girls!

Tinker Bell!
Guess what? I've decided I'm ...

...not gonna be a tinker fairy anymore!
What?

Well, I was thinking. Why do I have to be a tinker?
Because some silly hammer glowed?

I mean who's to say it wasn't some big mistake?

Maybe I can just switch my talent!
Switch your talent? I don't know, Tinker Bell!

If you could teach me your talents, any of you,
maybe I...

could show the queen I can work with nature, too.

And then she would let me go to the
Mainland for spring!

Tinker Bell, that's just not how it works.

Well, maybe she could.
She's right, she could!

Well, I've never heard of someone switching talents before.
She's right, me neither!

Look, you all do things that are beautiful and...

... magical and important...

... but me, well, there's got to be more to my
life than just pots and kettles...

All I'm asking is that you give me a chance!

I'll help you, Tinker Bell!

Thank you so...
Me, too!

Me, too. Could be fun!
Well, first time for everything, I guess!

What harm could come from trying?
Well...

I still think this is a bad idea.

So, for your first day of Water fairy
training, I could...

Show you how to make dripples in the pond.

Ok.
Or... teach you how to talk to the babbling brook!

That sounds fun, too.
Wait, wait, I got it! I got it!

Dew-drops on spider-webs!

Come on, I'll show you how to do it!
Good luck, Tink!

You can do it!
Aaa...

Go get them!

Just cup your hands like this, reach
into the water,

and ok, you heard of the dew-drop?

This is a dow-drop. That's water-fairy humour.

It's good.
Come on!

Ok, Tink, now this next part could be
a little tricky!

It takes a very steady, delicate hand to...

Aaa... Where is your dew-drop?
Oh!

Forgot my dew-drop.

Hey, I did ... it.

Shake that one off! Shake it off!

You can do this!

That's it!

That's it, Tink, you're doing it!
Good...

Uuu...
Now, Tink... try to... oh, no, sweetie...

You need to... maybe if you...
Well, you have to admire her persistence.

Tinker Bell!
You know, sometimes hammers glow...

... for a reason.

You know, you always struck me like
a light fairy kind of girl.

Have you seen Tink?
No, thank you, not thirsty.

No, no, not drink, Tink!

Pink? Well, I'm purple myself!
Tink! Have you seen Tink?

What? I do not stink! Maybe it's you, hey!

Hey, have you seen Tink?

Oh, Fairy Mary is gonna be crossed.

We'd better take some of these off
miss Bell's plate.

Right.
No, no, no, wait!

Was it a... Would you two stop mocking about?

Clunk here...
You see, Bobble...

I see Tinker Bell has got her work done mysteriously!

Where is she, anyway?
Oh, you see, she's...

She went with Cheese to...

No, no, Clunk means... she went to get cheese.

The food for Cheese the mouse!
yes, the food for Cheese!

Because the mouse... he was... whining!
Like a baby!

A wee-baby!

Ok, what can I teach you that's gonna
do the least amount of damage?

Oh, I know!

Follow me, Tinker Bell!

Wow, the last light of day!

It's the richest kind of all! Wait for it, wait...

... for it... Oh, ok and now!

Oh, wow!

Oh!

It's incredible!
Now, for the fun part!

Hum, do you think it's heavy?
No, it's light!

Ha-ha!

Ok, ok!

Stay!
Here, Tink, let me!

No, I almost got it!
I could just get it started!

This is impossible!

Look out!

Oh, no! Ooo!!!

Aaa!

I wonder how it's going!

Fly, Tink, fly!

We'll save you, Tink!
Cover your... tushy!

To hold flower paint!

Preparing for spring!
We do all these and more!

Yes!
Because being a Tinker is never a bore!

Tinker Bell, I'd like a word with you!
Fairy Mary!

You see, I was on my deliveries and...
it's actually kind of a...

Save it! I know what you've been up to, missy!

And I had such high hopes for you!

You would do well to listen to her!
Why? So I can do this for the rest of my life?!

I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

No, no! Not that you guys are...

I didn't mean that... guys, I wasn't...

I have to go.

Now flap them! Flap them, that's it!

Have fun!

Hey, Tink! You're ready?

A little nervous... actually!

Don't be silly, come on, you'll be fine!

We're teaching baby-birds how to fly.

First, you have to get their attention.
Smile and establish trust.

See? Ok. Open your wings, honey
and flap them.

Up and down, up and down, that's the way!

Faster! Faster, that's right! Yes, you're doing it!

Ok, now, come out this way a little bit.
You're ok, you're ok.

You got it! Keep flaping! Keep flaping!

Hey, why don't you help that last little guy?

Ok, ok, just smile and establish trust.

Hi there! Hey, little fella...

You wanna do some flap-flap today?

Oh, sure you do... all you do is you just...

You just flap your wings like this!

No, no, no, no, no! None of that, come on!

All we got to do is... Awwwww...

Look, I'm gonna level with you, ok?

I kind of bummed down on the whole
water and light fairy things.

I'm starting to run out of options here.

If you could see fit to flap your little wings
and take flight for a few measly seconds,

I might be able to go to the mainland and
bring happiness to the world!

What do you say? Wrong answer!

Oh, if I get stuck making acorn
kettles for the rest of my life,

I'm holding you personally responsible.
Hey, hey! Look at this!

Stop squirming! Just...

Hey!

Ok, ok, I'm letting go! I am letting go!

This is not working!

Hey, maybe that guy can help. He's
a really good flyer.

Hey, up there!

Hawk!

Quick, hide!

A hawk! Tinker Bell is in trouble!

Vidia!
Hey, this is my hiding spot!

But it's all yours now.

Aaa!

Aaa!

Get him!

Are you ok, Vidia?
Aaa...

Let me help you!
Don't touch me!

I'm fine!
I was only trying to help!

Stop trying!

Tinker Bell...
Ha! I can't hold water,

I can't hold light, birds hate me...

I'm just so... so useless.
Tink!

Great! I failed for the third time in a row.

At this rate, I should get to the Mainland right about...

... never!

Sil...

Beautiful!

You fixed it!
Wow!

Amazing!
What are you guys doing here?

It might be sparkliest thing I've ever seen!

And I've seen a lot of sparkly things!
It's a really pretty thingy!

What is it?
I don't know. I just found it!

Tinker Bell, don't you ever realize what
you're doing? You're tinkering!

Creating those gadgets, figuring things out,
fixing stuff, like this!

That's what tinkering is, sweetie.

Don't you like doing this? Isn't it what
you really love?

Yeah, who cares about going to the Mainland, anyway?
Well, I do, remember?

I wanna see where these things come from!

Why are you saying this, so you're
just giving up on me?

I mean aren't you going to teach me to be
a garden fairy anymore?

Oh, sweetie, I think this is your talent!

Tink, we just want you to be happy.

If you really want me to be happy, you'd help me
get to the Mainland, like you promissed!

Please, Tinker Bell, just... just think about it!

Will you teach me how to be a fast-flying fairy?

Please! I know I could do it!

With your help, I could be flying as
fast as you in no time!

Vidia, you're my last hope! All my friends
have given up on me!

Rosetta won't even try to teach me to
be a garden fairy now!

I bet I could at least paint some flowers or...

... plant some sproutings! There must
be something I could do!

Or if you really want to be a garden fairy...

Capture the sprinting thistles! Aaa! Well!

Ok, I can do this! Yeah!

Ok! Ready, Cheese?

Oh, come on! They're just wheeds!

Besides, they're only 7 or 8 at the
most, right?

We can do this! I know we can do this!

What do you say?

This ought to be good!

Hey!

Come on, you! Come on, just...

This way! Ah, it's working! It's working!

Ha!

Come on!

Aaa!

Wait, wait, wait! Come back!

Come back!

Ah, these things just won't listen!

Come on, Cheese, go, go, go!

Hey, definitely more than eight!

Please, file and get to the ground in an
orderly manner!

Wait!

Oh, no! Come on!

Sorry, sorry! Excuse me!

I'm so sorry!

This is the last patch!

Look out!

Sorry! Sorry!

Oh, no!
Tink, what happened?

Tinker Bell, what did you think you
were doing?
I was just...

I was just trying to... I thought that if I
could capture the thistles, then...

There isn't a garden fairy alive who can
control those wheeds!

What were you trying to prove?
I...

She's right, Tink, this is all gone too far!

By the second star!

All the preparations for spring! How did this...

Queen Clarion! It...

It was me! I did it!

It's all my fault!
Tinker Bell!

I'm sorry!

I don't think we can fix this in time!
We're going to have to cancel spring!

Or postpone it, to the very least!

What? And put my fairies back to work?
But we can't, we can't do that! If...

The snow isn't melted, the...

And then in autumn, there will be
nothing to harvest!

Spring must happen on time, or the
balance of nature will be undone!

There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!

It has, did you ever hear of the Ice Age?
Settle down! All of you!

Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

No!
Oh, no!

We were so close, now it's all gone!

Who's going to paint our leaves now?

Plants will never grow!
No more hills covered in daffodils?

You're ok, Tink?
Oh, yeah!

Yeah, I'm fine!

I just came hoping to get a quick refill!

I'm going away for a while.
Oh, how long are you going to be gone?

Well, actually, forever!
Forever? Well...

In that case...

A double scoop!

Forever is a pretty long time, so I hear!
Thanks, Terrence!

You know my name?
Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

I don't know. I'm just a dust keeper guy.

I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow!

Terrence, what are you talking about? You're
probably the most important one there is!

Without you, no one would have any magic.

Your talent makes who you are! You
should be proud of it!

I am!

I... I... I'd better get going!

Oh, oh, hey, Cheese!

Be proud of your talent! What talent?

I couldn't even get these silly things to work!

Aaa... Lost things!

That's it!

Attention, everyone!

I'm afraid I have distressing news!

There is no way spring can come on time!

Months of work was lost.

And it will take us months to restore it all.

So when the ever blossom opens tomorrow,
I'm afraid we will not be going to the...

Mainland for spring.

Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

Tinker Bell?

Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...
Just hear me out.

Please!... You!

How long does it take you to paint a ladybug?

I don't know. Ten, 15 minutes, I guess!

See? We can build more!

I can show you how! Making paints, gathering
seeds, we can do it all in no time!

We have to at least try!
Wait! Are we going to listen to her?

She's the reason we're in this mess in
the first place!

But I can fix...
Tinker Bell is going to save us,

with her dopey little do-hickies!

What is your problem, Vidia? Why do
you think you're so much better than me?

I am better than you, sweetie, I didn't
ruin spring!

At least now I'm trying to help! Have you
ever helped anyone besides yourself?

Well, I tried to help you! Maybe I should have
told you to...

... capture the hawk instead of the thistles!

Perhaps Tinker Bell was not the only one responsible!

It seems to me that your fast-flying talent is well
suited to chasing down...

... each and everyone of the thistles!

Me?
Yes. And I expect them all...

... to be returned to Neddlepoint Meadow as
soon as possible!

But... but that could take forever!

Then I suggest you get started!

Now, Tinker Bell, are you sure you can do this?

Yes!

Because I'm a Tinker! It's who I am!

And Tinkers fix things!

But I can't do it alone!

Command us, miss Bell!

I'll help!
Show us how, Tink!

I'll help you!
Me, too!

Ok. Gather all the twigs you can, all different sizes!
And tree-saps, we need lots of that!

But most importantly, we need to find lost things!

Ok, what have you got?
How about this?

Will this do?
Can you use this fuzzy thing, miss Bell?

Oh, yeah!
It's not fuzzy!

Yes, it is!
No, it isn't!

Twig! Hammer! Magnification, please!

Thank you.

And that's how you do it.

Now what do you suppose that...

Aaa!
Aaa!

Oh...
Clunk!

You smell funny!

Oh!
Uuu!

I saw it first!
I bumped into it!

Let's tie this off here... so you just
squeeze this.

Then let it go and...
Aaa!

See? Simple!

Now, just put the berries in and we'll
have plenty of paint in no time!

We did it!

Six, seven and eight.

Ohhh!

You did it, Tinker Bell! You saved spring!

We all did it.
Queen Clarion!

Can't Tink come with us to the Mainland?
Yeah!

She's done so much for everyone!
No, no, you guys, really!

I don't need to go.
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

It's ok! My work is here and I still have so
much to do.

Not here, you don't!
But I...

No but!
Surprise, miss Bell!

We found your tiny dancer!

Actually, I ran across this myself many
seasons ago!

I didn't have a clue what it was or how
to fix it.

You did, Tinker Bell! You are quite a rare
talent indeed!

And I imagine there's a little girl out
there who's missing this.

What do you mean? How...?

I think that perhaps a certain Tinker fairy
might have a job to do afterall.

On the Mainland!
You mean I...

I knew you can...
Oh, Tink!

Oh, we can help, miss Bell!
I'm strong!

Come on, we got to go right now!
Thank you, your highness!

But how will I find who it belongs to?
You'll know!

Now, go!

Thank you!

Tink! Hey! Something to help you on the Mainland!

Oh, Terrence, that's so sweet!

Good luck, Tink!
To the air, fairies!

To the air! The Mainland awaits.

Come away with me now, to the sky.

Up on the hills and the sea,

Far beyond, where memories lie,

To a place where I'm free to believe!

Oh, can you hear them all,

No matter what Polly may do?

Let the stars fill us all,

And the moon craddle the soul,
So to yourself be true!

The blanket of snow is so cold,

Each flower waits for the sun
And the blissful tears of the rain!

It's a promise for everyone!

Then come away with me, friends,

No matter where you come from!

With a light in our hearts,
We will never part,

No matter how far we go!
Fairies to the South! To the East and West!

Deep in the forrest we go!

Wake up, sleepy heads!
Creatures are all fast asleep!

With a kiss and a grim we will wake

And always in safety we'll keep.

And then we'll dance to the light,
To the sun sparkles at dawn.

And away we will go
Like the last winter snow,

Soon our work will be done!

Oh, come with me you all!

No matter wht Polly may do!

So to yourself be true!

Oh, come with me now you all,

No matter what Polly may do!

Let the stars fill us all
And the moon cradle the soul!

So to yourself be true!

So to yourself be true!

Aaa!

Aaa!

Mommy! Guess what?

Guess what?
Yes, Wendy, what is it, darling?

A fairy's work is much more than
at first it might appear!

Suppose your broken clock ticks,
though it hasn't in a year!

Perchance you found a toy you lost or
gingling bells you hear!

It all means that one very special fairy...

... might be near!
