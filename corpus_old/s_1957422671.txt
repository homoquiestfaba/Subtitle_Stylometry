You're a carrier,
you're Tom Riley.



this is gonna be tough

for you to understand.
Roger that.

multiple dimensions.

Wait, wait, wait, put
the gun away, wait, wait.

[crickets chirping]

[gun fires]

[woman laughs]

[Tom pants]

[Tom grunts]

[Tom breathes heavily]

[Tom knocks]

[Tom sighs]

[Tom grunts]

How the fuck am I gonna get?

[Tom groans]

Oh, fat ass, goddamn,
whoa, whoa, oh, oh!

No, no, [grunts]
oh, shit, oh, fuck.

[Tom sighs]

[Tom pants]

[phone rings]

[phone beeps]

Hello?

What, who?

No, there's nobody
here by that name.

[phone beeps]

[Tom sighs]

Whoa.

Where'd this come from?

Bonus.

Whose camera is this?

Hello there.

[door creaks]

[door slams]

[Tom sighs]

What the fuck, was I
imagining all of that?

[footsteps pattering]

Who the fuck was that?

[door creaks]

Hello?

[toy jingles]

What the fuck is this?

Do I have a cat?

Oh, okay, psst, psst, psst.

Hey, here girl, boy.

[toy rattles]

What the fuck?

Oh, hello.

Hello, here, I'll throw it back
up there for you, you ready?

[toy jingles]

Psst, psst, psst.

[toys clattering]

Who's up there?

Uh, this can't be.

[drawer rattles]

Who the fuck?

There's no way if all these
times... what the fuck is this?

This can't be happening again.

[drawers rattling]

What the fuck happened here?

[Tom sighs]

[door creaks]

I need to know what
I got going on here.

I need to know [sighs]
whether I've got somebody

in this house, or a
you-know-what problem.

The ghost meter,
this'll tell me.

Oh!
[meter rattles]

Jesus Christ, son of a bitch.

Oh, man.

Get this. [sighs]

All right.

[floor creaks]

What the fuck am I
gonna do with this?

I either got a ghost
problem or a people problem,

but I plan on solving them both.

I have a weapon.

Nothing.

Nothing.

I'm coming up there.

[door rattles]

You better come the
fuck out of there.

My heart's beating
out of my chest.

[door rattles]

[Tom sighs]

[door rattles]

I know you're in there.

[Tom shouts]

What are you doing in here?

[door rattles]

When did I get a fucking cat?

Sorry.

That means we got
a person in here.

There's no paranormal
activity at all.

Hello?

[Tom sighs]

I know this isn't a ghost.

Listen, if you just
get out of here,

there's gonna be no trouble.

Just get out of here.

No.

[floor creaks]

There's nothing
spiritual in here.

[chip bag crinkles]

Whoever's in here,
take this opportunity

and get the fuck out.

[Tom grunts]

What the fuck is that?

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Oh, no, no, no.

[machine beeps]

Oh, no.

[knife clatters]

Son of a bitch, that was a
fresh bag of chips. [sighs]

What the fuck is
with the dog beds?

I don't have a
dog, let alone two.

[Tom sighs]

Hello?

Who's out there?

Fucking throw a knife at me.

[phone rings]

[Tom gasps]

Fuck.

Scared the shit out of me.
[phone rings]

Hello?

No, there's nobody
here by that name.

I already told you this.

Fuck.

No, no, no, no, no.

Hello?

Hello?

Oh, fuck it.

[Tom sighs]

What the fuck is going on here?

[chair clatters]

I'm not scared of you.

[chair clatters]

Do it again, badass.

[demon roars]

[Tom groans]

Fuck my life. [sighs]

[chair clatters]

I've done this before,
I'll do it again.

I need to find some equipment.

[chip bag crinkles]

[demon roars]

[chip bag crinkles]

[creature screams]

Jesus Christ.

[ghost screams]

[Tom groans]

[Tom pants]

That was a big fucking boy.

[Tom sighs]

[Tom grunts]

I'm a big boy, too.

[static crackles]

Fuck, it's cold in here.

Where'd you go, big boy?

No wonder it's so cold in
here, the window's open.

Let me shut this thing.

No, don't shut it?

Who's in here?

Is this Matt and Rachel?

Is this a ghost?

[demon roars]

Do you know who I am?

You don't know who I am?

[demon roars]

You do, now you're
just fucking with me.

You know, I'm not scared of you.

[demon roars]

Yeah, no, I'm not scared of you.

Who... who the fuck
is that out there?

What, my fucking chips
are gone, son of a bitch.

[demon roars]

[static crackles]

Hello?

Who are you?

You can stay the fuck out
there, I'm not scared of you.

[demon roars]

Well, I'm feeling
mighty proud of myself.

What time does it
say on that clock?

I managed to get rid of this
one in less than 20 minutes?

I'm getting good at this shit.

I don't do this professionally.

Caffeine-free diet soda?

Why don't I just drink the
juice from that jar of pickles?

Oh, fucking pickles.

Gift from God.

Hmm.

What the fuck is with this shit?

Who is having shit sent
to my house? [sighs]

And this bullshit.

[chip bag crinkles]

Why couldn't I have a
demon on a diet, dammit.

Where is that book?

Oh, thank God something's
where I left it.

Now, what [sighs]
was I dealing with?

Or what ass did I
kick out of here?

No.

What's this about a... a
demon that turns into a cat?

That white cat, that little
sweet, white cat is not a demon.

Well, you know what?

Hmm.

Wait, this could be my guy.

"From the list of lesser
known demons, Malichi,

he is a demon known to torment
persons by causing disarray.

A frequent technique he uses is

to move objects in an attempt

to make the living believe
they are going insane."

Well, every room I walk
into shifts someplace else,

and look, talk about
disarray. [sighs]

You know, that also
explains the cat,

'cause I don't have a cat, but
there's a cat here. [sighs]

He placed it here to
make me think I'm nuts.

And the dog beds, I
don't have fucking dogs.

It also says, "his face is
gray and ashen," which it was,

"with elongated
arms that he uses

to walk with in
a staggered gait.

He is driven away
when his attempts

to frighten mortals
are unsuccessful."

Well, he didn't scare...
well, he kind of did scare me,

but he wasn't getting what
he wanted, so he left.

"He considers ghosts allies
and often congregates with him.

Following his departure,
paranormal events often increase

if ghosts are present

because they yearn for
Malichi's"... I don't know

if that, I'm even
pronouncing that right.

"But they yearn for
Malichi's presence

and consider anyone responsible

for his departure a
target for physical harm.

Beware of what comes after the
departure of the demon," ooh.

"Also, be cognizant

that Malichi's leaving
often signals the arrival

of demons more powerful
and malevolent.

The ghost will attack
those that will not leave,

and those attacks will
increase in intensity

and become more
and more dangerous.

If they eventually rejoin
with a demonic force,

it is likely their attacks
will be life threatening."

Well, I don't get the
feeling there's anything else

in this house, so.

He's gone.

Yeah, see, stuff in here was
moved every time I walked back

into this room, like
that wasn't there.

The phone was there 'cause
I ripped it off the wall,

but stuff's moved everywhere.

[phone rings]

Jesus Christ, it's the
fucking loudest phone.

Hello?

I told you, no one
lives here by that name!

[phone rings]

[background noise
drowns out speaker]

[phone rings]

How is that possible?

[phone rings]

[child laughs]

Hello?

[Tom sighs]

Well, was this before or
after I banished its ass?

[Tom sighs]

[chair clatters]

[door creaks]

[Tom sighs]

So much for a little reprieve.

Let's see what the fuck's
going on down here.

[light switch clicks]

What the fuck,

the lights don't... of
course the lights don't work.

[baby cries]

Is that a baby crying?

[light switch clicks]

Great, another freaking
light that doesn't work.

[baby cries]

That's definitely
coming from over here.

Oh, that's cute.

[baby screams]

What the fuck, I can't... ow.
[furniture clatters]

I can't see.
[banging echoes]

[baby laughs]

How do I get the
fuck out of here?

Here we go, here we go. [pants]

[Tom sighs]

I don't know what the fuck
that is in the basement,

but I need to get
my bearings together

before I start
dealing with that.

What, what the fuck
is that out there?

The fuck is that?

Let me get.

Oh, I'll use this.

I can't see with the lights on.

There's something
out there, somebody.

What the fuck else
could be going on?

Oh, this is fucking beautiful.

What the fuck is he doing?

Wait, where'd he go?

Where the fuck did he...

Oh, I can't see shit out there.

[demon roars]

[floor creaks]

Well, I don't know
where he went,

or it went, but it's
outside, so. [sighs]

That's where it needs to stay.

So the obvious question

whoever's watching
this will be asking is,

why does this guy
record everything

that goes on in his life?

Well, people that have seen
the previous recordings think

I'm nuts for staying
here, which I probably am.

But people that don't,
and I tell this to,

think I'm nuts, which
is why I record it,

specifically on a camera
that I don't even know

where it came from, but
it's here, so I'm using it.

I don't know where half the
stuff in this house came from,

the cat, the dogs
I haven't seen,

but there's dog beds
and toys everywhere

and dog biscuits on top
of the refrigerator.

I... [sighs] this
one's got me baffled.

I really don't know
what's going on,

but the thing that counts
is that it is out there.

[demon roars]

[Tom gasps]

What the fuck happened?

[door slams]

[door rattles]

[Tom sighs]

I gotta unlock
this fucking door.

[Tom cries out]

Get the fuck off of me! [pants]

[Tom groans]

[door creaks]

[Tom screams]

The fuck?

This fucking house of horrors.

How come that light's on?

[floor creaks]

I don't want to
fucking stab you.

But I'll fucking cut you.

[Tom grunts]

You know what I'm
feeling right now?

I'm feeling some
big dick energy.

There's nothing out there.

[static crackles]

[demon roars]

After all this time,
anything that's trying

to get to me ought to know

I can't be fooled.

[chair bangs]

You motherfucker, come out
from under there, come out!

Where the fuck is this thing?

[chair rustles]

Son of a bitch!

What the fuck?

Oh, Christ, I'm stuck. [pants]

What the fuck is this?

Where's this shit
keep coming from?

Like am I a depository
for ghost bullshit,

or just bullshit in... I need
to open some of these boxes.

There might be something
good in one of them,

a nice little bonus.

[static crackles]

I can't see a fucking thing.

[light switch snaps]

[demon roars]

Well, at least the
power is back on.

Why are the lights out
in the kitchen now?

What is that smell?

If Satan had an asshole,
this is what it smells like.

So that jester was outside,
I chased out Malichi,

but something was
in that bathroom.

But maybe like that book said,

where if they're not
frightening you, they take off.

Maybe it's gone.

It's fucking cold
in here, though.

The thing is about that jester,

is

I don't remember seeing that

in my book.

Man, this place is fucked up.

Let's see what I got here.

Thank God there's lots of
pictures, but you know what?

What am I looking for?

I've been through this
book front to back,

and I know that
jester isn't in here.

Let me see, I think
I had another book

that I picked up at a yard sale.

Where the fuck is that thing?

Oh, oh, oh.

"How to Rid Your House of
Evil," by Ted Holmberg.

Let's see what Ted has to say.

We'll start from
the beginning here.

"Any house can be
invaded by evil.

The number one way to keep
your house a happy home

and free of demonic
possessions is

to make your house
a happy house.

You have to put out
flowers, play cheery music,

be positive, and no demon
will want to be around."

Are you a fucking idiot?

Ted, you don't
know shit. [sighs]

Fucking how can
this be happening?

Every time I think
these things are gone,

things are quiet for a while,
and then they come back.

Do I have

something in this home?

What the fuck is that smell?

Let me make sure.

So I could sure know if fucking
demon turds are in there.

[Tom sighs]

Everything keeps getting moved.

This is just... well, this is
pretty much the way it's been.

If I have nothing in here,
nothing should be getting moved.

[Tom sighs]

I need to take it easy here.

Oh, fuck. [sighs]

Hello?

I dare you

to come out.

Show yourself!

Well, there ain't shit in here.

[Tom grunts]

What the fuck is
that smell, God.

It's fucking getting
cold in here.

[Tom snores]

[door clatters]

[Tom cries out]

Motherfucking.

[Tom mutters]

[door slams]

So much for these warm
fucking cheery thoughts.

I was having a nice fucking
dream about ice cream.

Where are you?

I can smell you.

What a fucking shit hole.

[Tom cries out]

Fuck, this is a nasty
motherfucker right here,

to throw a fake fucking
pumpkin at me. [sighs]

I need to find some... he
ain't scared of knives.

How the fuck can
something even be in here?

I need a cross, where's
that fucking cross?

Oh, fucking cross, I'm lucky
God don't strike me dead

where I'm standing.

Fucking hit me with
a fucking pumpkin?

I'm gonna hit you with my
foot right in your ghost ass.

What the fuck is that,
is that a brownie?

[Tom sniffs]

Hmm, goddamn.

I don't know where the fuck
that came from, but mm.

[floor creaks]

[Tom cries out]

Nothing here.

I've got this terrible
feeling of dread,

like everything bad's
gonna happen at once.

[demon roars]

[door creaks]

[door slams]

You motherfucker. [sighs]

What the fuck was that?

[Tom screams]

Goddammit, fuck.

[water trickles]

[door creaks]

Fucking stabbed
me, what the fuck?

I know... where the
fuck is the stab mark?

I fucking know I got stabbed.

What the fuck, I'm
losing my fucking mind.

I am so far in over my head.

For this one, I could
sure use a hand.

What the fuck is that?

[demon roars]

"You said you needed a hand."

It's a fucking hand,
it's a fucking hand.

Oh, what the fuck?

What the fuck, what the
fuck was in that brownie?

[demon roars]

[hand patters]

What the fuck is that?

Oh, what the fuck?

[light switch clicks]

[attic door creaks]

[attic door shuts]

[Tom stomps]

[Tom sighs]

[static crackles]

[light switch clicks]

Oh, that's been
running all this time?

[floor creaks]

What the fuck happened
to my brownie?

Mm, it's a pretzel.

I need to do a little
demon research.

[Tom sighs]

[Tom grunts]

[Tom pants]

What the fuck?

Hello?

All right.

[floor creaks]

Let's do a little googling.

What the fuck is going on?

I'm not typing, what
the fuck is going on?

What the fuck is this?

You seeing this?

Of course you're seeing
it, I'm seeing it.

"Not your home, not your home."

What the fuck, no
ashes to write in?

[Tom burps]

Oh, excuse me.

"He is coming,"
who the fuck is he?

Well, we've been over
this, this is my home.

What the fuck is that?

[printer whirs]

"Not your home, not your
home, not your home,

he is coming, he is
coming, he is coming."

What the fuck?

I just pulled the
plug on this thing.

[printer whirs]

Fuck me, fuck you!

[paper crumples]

Let's see if old [sighs]
Ted here can shine

any light on this.

Let me get this on
the other camera, too.

Here [indistinct].

Okay, Ted.

That dude looks like what
I'm looking for, page 212.

He says you should try
communicating with the spirits.

Where the fuck is that thing?

There.

Okay.

This is the best way I know of.

Communicating.

Ouija board, are there any
ghosts or spirits in the house?

[demon roars]

Yes, that's what I
was afraid of. [sighs]

So he's saying I should
communicate with these fuckers.

"Beware when communicating
with the paranormal.

Be very careful," no shit.

"There is an account given
of an evil occultist,

Travis McHenry, who
long ago opened a portal

to the spirit world and would
regularly summon evil spirits

to attack those he despised.

Unfortunately, Travis
summoned the demon known

as the bringer of disease,
famine, and drought.

He could not control this demon

and was drug into the portal,

never to be seen or
heard from again.

The demon he summoned, Pazuzu."

Don't say that name!

Who the fuck are you?

[rain patters]

I was a priest when I
walked among the living.

Where's your body?

That name you said-

Pazuzu?

Don't say that name!

I attempted to exorcize
him from a small child.

He said I angered him
because I looked like Jesus.

Like Jesus on heroin, maybe.

He tore my body apart

and spread the pieces
across the land.

He is unstoppable.

Well, the good news is,

I think I can help
you find your hand.

[thunder rumbles]

So what's he look like?

He will not show himself
[door creaks]

to any living soul, but
you will know he is here,

and he will bring
other demons with him,

some of which are already here,

and they will soon launch a
vicious attack against you.

[thunder rumbles]
[rain patters]

So I got this evil jester
running around the house,

I got this hunchback
out in the driveway.

I've got I think what's
your hand running around.

There's doors opening and
closing, stuff that's happening.

The laptop's saying
"He is coming,

he is coming, he is coming,"
the printer's printing out,

"He's coming, he's
coming, he's coming."

When is he coming, this Pazuzu?

I said don't say that name.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, druggo
Jesus, take it easy.

No, he is here!

Where is he?

[Tom grunts]

[doors slamming]

Jesus Christ, my fucking
life ain't getting no better.

[door creaks]
[Tom pants]

[door rattles]

You fucking cocksucker,
who the fuck are you?

What the fuck are you?

[shoes squeaking]

[Tom pants]

[attic door bangs]

[demon roars]

What?

No, no, no, no.

No, no! [pants]

[Tom grunts]

[Tom cries out]

Oh, you cocksucker.

Come, show yourself.

Show yourself!

[Tom cries out]

[Tom pants]

[Tom grunts]

Fucking pants are falling down.

[Tom cries out]

[Tom grunts]

[Tom pants]

What the fuck is that smell?

What the fuck?

[demon roars]

Oh my God.

[toilet flushes]

Fucking

flush the toilet
for Christ's sakes.

[door slams]

[Tom stomps]

Fuck this.

[door slams]

[Tom grunts]

[chair creaks]

You motherfucker.

[child laughs]

[Tom cries out]

Oh, that fucking
hurt, you bastard.

I need to get the fuck
out of this house.

Wait, I can't get
out the front door,

but I can get out that
window, that's how I got in,

and I'm gonna take this camera
with me... and a flashlight

and the cross, who
left these here?

This is perfect.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, fuck.

I need this, I need this.

How the fuck?

[Tom pants]

Fucking cunt.

[Tom grunts]

Simone Biles I'm not.

What the fuck?

Goddammit. [pants]

Who the fuck are you? [screams]

[Tom screams]

I think I shook it.

[demon roars]
[demon growls]

Stop it!

[demon cries out]

Listen, this may be the
last will and testament

of Tom Riley, but I don't
know whether I'm better off

in there or out here
in these haunted woods.

But I've come to
realize that this is not

about that house being haunted.

This is about this
land being haunted.

[gun fires]

What the fuck was that?

[Tom pants]

I think I'm gonna go
deeper into the woods here

and try and put some distance
between me and the house.

But the fact of it is, is
this is haunted property.

There's things going on here,

so long before this
house was even here,

there was something here
that has brought this on.

What the fuck was that?

What the fuck are
you doing out here?

What are you pointing at?

[glass shatters]

What is that up there?

How do you zoom this thing?

Ugh, druggo Jesus, I
can't leave him in there.

[glass shatters]

What the fuck is that?

Ugh.

Bitch, I know, I'm going
back there in a minute.

Where the fuck?

I gotta go in there and
save him from this bullshit.

Here I go again
with this bullshit.

[camera rattles]

I guess the thought
never... oh, God,

crossed my fucking mind about
eating a fucking carrot.

Size 44, my ass. [grunts]

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Oh. [pants]

Holmberg, you'd better be right.

Music. [mutters]

Okay, flowers.

[Tom pants]
[pencil scrawls]

Hey, Ben, Ben?

Listen, here's a list of
shit I need you to get,

and I need you to get it
quick, and be nice to the lady.

[ghost screeches]

Druggo Jesus, all
right, Father Murphy,

I know that's your real name.

I met you here in
this house a couple

of years ago at Christmas.

Father Murphy?

Hello?

Father Murphy?

Oh shit.

Do I want to go up here?

[attic door creaks]

In the name of Jesus
Christ, get out!

[demon roars]

Well, that worked.

[static crackles]

In the name of Jesus
Christ, get out!

Oh, that was convenient.

[door shuts]

Father Murphy?

[door rattles]

Father Murphy?

[floor creaks]

Father Murphy?

Father Murphy, what the fuck?

I don't want to play anymore.

I want to get the
fuck out of here.

Father Murphy, where's
your floating nugget?

Father Murphy!

[static crackles]

Pazuzu, you're not
supposed to show yourself.

In the name of Jesus
Christ, get out!

In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you, get out!

[Pazuzu growls]

I'm not scared of you, in the
name of Jesus Christ, get out!

[Pazuzu growls]

Oh my God. [sighs]

[Tom grunts]

What the fuck is this guy?

[Tom pants]

I can't do this alone.

Brother, you're not alone.

I'm here, too.

Oh, man, of all the Toms from
all the parallel universes,

I had to be you?
Why are you body shaming us?

You're fucking
disgusting, get out of here.

Ugh, deal with it yourself.

You're just
disgusting, go, go, go.

Sorry about that.

Thank God you're here.

How can I help?

Find druggo Jesus.

Who?

His real name's Father
Murphy, he's a priest.

Find his head, it's
somewhere in this house.

You killed a priest?

No, I didn't kill
a priest, come on.

I've been beaten, stabbed,
I even fell on something

that went up my ass and
I think it's still there.

I just need you to find his
head and get it out of here.

You're probably gonna
find it upstairs

where there were
these two demons.

I took care of them,
there's one left

and I can't figure him out.

But I read something,
and it's ridiculous,

but I'm gonna try it.

Why not just leave, then?

Because getting rid

of this demon will undo all
the horrible things he's done.

Now please, just find that
head and get it out of here.

All right, I'm on it.

Thank you, Tom.

Oh, and Tom, it's
a floating head.


The head, it floats.

Looking for a
floating Jesus head.

That's a first.

[Tom pants]

[door shuts]

[attic door creaks]

Hello, hello, hello?

What the fuck am I
even looking for?

This is fucking crazy.

[Tom sighs]

Here goes nothing, Ted Holmberg,
I sure hope you're right.

[upbeat music]

These fucking cat
toys, does he have a cat?

â™ª Wish I could deal
with my emotions â™ª

â™ª So you don't bear them all â™ª

Where the fuck
is this Jesus head?

[Father Murphy] I'm over here.

Say that again?

[Father Murphy] I'm over here.

I hear you, I hear
you, I hear you.

â™ª I've been chasing
studs and bait â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Players changing,
playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same, I was afraid â™ª

â™ª I couldn't see it through â™ª

â™ª I look away to
lose your gaze â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

Behold, druggo
Jesus, how you feeling?

I have a bit of a headache.

All right, I'm going
to get you out of here.

I've got an idea.

â™ª I've been chasing
studs and bait â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Made a change
and playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same, I was afraid â™ª

â™ª I couldn't see it through â™ª

I'm just gonna put you
in here so I can carry you

and keep you hidden.

Can you breathe okay?

[Father Murphy] I
don't need to breathe.

Oh, that's right, sorry.

[Father Murphy cries out]

Sorry.

[Tom stomps]

â™ª I was afraid â™ª

He's having a dance party now?

The fuck is wrong with him?

â™ª All I see is you â™ª

â™ª Made a change
and playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same â™ª

Oh, calm down.

â™ª I was afraid I
couldn't see it through â™ª

â™ª Made a change
and playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same, I was afraid â™ª

â™ª I couldn't see it through â™ª

Hey, big guy,
this is all for you!

â™ª Gaze and all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Baby, I can't run away â™ª

use that package about now!

[ghost shrieks]

Thanks.

Flowers, this is a happy house!

[demon growls]

Get out!

Yes, yes, Tom Riley, undefeated!

Pazuzu, out of here, out
of here, thanks, Ben!

[Tom sighs]

Fuck. [pants]

I'm fucking exhausted.

[Tom sighs]

Ugh.

[floor creaks]

What the hell is that?

You've gotta be kidding me.

Way to go, Father Murphy.

[door rattles]

Did that door just open?

Who the hell is here?

[door slams]
[keys jingling]

Hello?

Who the fuck are you?

Man, it's cold in here.

[phone rings]

Hello?


Yeah, it's Holly.

Obviously the phone's working
if you're talking to me.

Why didn't you just
call me on my cellphone?

Listen, I'll call you but
I've gotta let the dogs out,

they're going crazy, all right.

She can't see me.

[keys jingling]

Hey, puppies.

Hi, come on, come on,
let's go out there.

Come on, come over
here, come over here.

[dog barks]

[background noise
drowns out speaker]

[dog barks]

I didn't think to check
the fucking bedroom.

I'm dead.

Down, down.

I'm dead, she can't
see me 'cause I'm dead,

and that's why I
could see Pazuzu.

[dogs panting]

I guess I can go out
through the front door now.

Come here.

See you guys.

Don't shit in the house.

How'd this get out here?

You know what, fuck
it, I earned it, bonus.

[ghost shrieks]

I hear you.

Well, now what?

What's this, oh, shit, I didn't
know there was a video light

on this thing, that sure
makes it easier to see.

Well,

this is kind of morbid,
but I'm headed out

where I think I died,

to see if,

see if there's a body there.

Oh, no.

Well, that's my shoes,
my pants, my shirt.

That's definitely me.

My glasses.

And there's a bullet
hole, I'm sorry, buddy.

[phone rings]

Are you fucking kidding me?

[phone rings]

Hello?

Turn around?

[fire crackles]

[ghost laughs]

[woman screams]

[upbeat music]

â™ª Candy hearts and
spirits of all kinds â™ª

â™ª Are swimming in my eyes â™ª

â™ª And speaking loud and clear â™ª

â™ª Ration passion â™ª

â™ª I wish I could deal
with my emotions â™ª

â™ª So you don't bear them all â™ª

â™ª I've been chasing
studs and bait â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Made a change
in playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same, I was afraid â™ª

â™ª I couldn't see it through â™ª

â™ª I look away to
lose your gaze â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª Pray for clouds and
chase the rain away â™ª

â™ª Unveil the window panes â™ª

â™ª When I'm not next to you â™ª

â™ª Stone impression â™ª

â™ª The image that my
lover Gary calls â™ª

â™ª He calls, and you
made a [indistinct] â™ª

â™ª Catch me when I fall â™ª

â™ª I've been chasing
studs and bait â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Made a change
in playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same, I was afraid â™ª

â™ª I couldn't see it through â™ª

â™ª I look away to

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

â™ª I've been chasing
studs and bait â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Created a change
in playing games â™ª

â™ª But wasted in my youth â™ª

â™ª All the same, I was afraid â™ª

â™ª I couldn't see it through â™ª

â™ª I look away to
lose your gaze â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Baby, I can't run away â™ª

â™ª If all I see is you â™ª

â™ª I can't shake
this [indistinct] â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª I can't give
you [indistinct] â™ª

â™ª When all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Sunny days will save the day â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

â™ª Baby, I can't run away â™ª

â™ª And all I see is you â™ª

where's Sophie and Archer?
