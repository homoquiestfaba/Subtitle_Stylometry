Three of a kind. Let's do this.

That's it? Three guys?

Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share.

Five shares is plenty.

Six shares. Don't forget the
guy who planned the job.

He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice?

I know why they call him the Joker.

So why do they call him the Joker?

I heard he wears makeup.

Makeup?

Yeah! to scare people.
You know, warpaint?

Alright everybody, hands up
heads down!

I said, hands up,
heads down!

Let's go pal! I'm
making a withdrawal here.

Put your hands up!

Here comes the silent alarm.

There it goes.

Heads down!

Get down. I said stay
down there!

That's funny it didn't dial out to 911.
I was trying to reach a private number.

Is it a problem?

No, I'm done here...

Obviously we don't want you doing anything
with your hands other than holding on for dear life.

On the ground! Stay on the ground!

Nobody make a move! Nobody!

Stay down!

Come here!

Do you have any idea who
you're stealing from?

You and your friends are dead!

He's out, right?

Where did you learn to count?

They wired this thing up with like 5000 Volts.

What kind of bank does that?

A mob bank.

I guess the Joker is
as crazy as they say.

Where is the alarm guy?

The boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

One less share, right?

Funny... He told me something similar.

He what? No, no!

That's a lot of money. If this Joker guy was so
smart he'd had us bring a bigger car.

I'm betting the Joker told you to kill
me as soon as we loaded the cash.

No, no, no, no...
I kill the bus driver.

Bus driver?

What bus driver?

School's out. Time to go.

Cat's not getting up, is he?

That's a lot of money.

What happened to the rest of the guys?

You think you're smart, huh?

Well, the guy that hired you

will just do the same with you.

Ah, criminals in this town used
to believe in things.

Honor, respect! Look at you!
What do you believe in?

Huh, what do you believe in?

I believe whatever doesn't kill
you simply makes you...

stranger.

Mr. Mayor, you were elected in
the campaign to clean up the city.

When are you going to start?

Well, Mike, I believe I already have.

Like the so-called Batman? We're
hearing that he's doing some good.

That criminals are running scared.
But I say...

Nah, man... I don't like it tonight.

What are you? Superstitious?

You got more chance of winning
the powerball than running into him.

That simply is not true.
I'm told that

Our men in the major crimes unit
are close to...

Mayor says you're closing
in on the Batman.

The investigation is ongoing.

Ever intending to see your wife
again, lieutenant?

I thought you had to go
look after your mother, detective?

Checked her back into the hospital.

Sorry.

So he hasn't shown up?

I hope he doesn't.

I like reminding everybody
that he's out there.

Why wouldn't he come?

Hopefully because he is busy.

That's why we bring dogs.

Hey, my filhotinhos.

Look what your drugs
did to my customers.

Buyer beware. I told you
my compound would take you places.

I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

My business repeat customers.

If you don't like what I have to offer
you can buy from someone else.

Assuming Batman left
anyone to buy from...

My dogs are hungry!

Pity there is only one of you.

That's not him.

That's more like it.

Don't let me find you out here again.

We are trying to help you.

I don't need help!

Not my diagnosis.

What gives you the right?

What's the difference between you and me?

I'm not wearing hockey pads.

He can't resist showing us
his face.

What's he hiding
under that makeup?

Can we get a minute,
people, please?

Him again?
Who were the others?

Another bunch of smalltimers.

Some of the marked
bills I gave you.

My detectives have been making
drug buys with them for weeks.

This bank puts another draft of the mob.
That makes five.

We found a bulk of the dirty cash.

Time to move in.

We would have to hit all banks
simultaneously. Swat teams, backup.

What about this Joker guy?

One man or the entire mob?
He can wait.

When the new DA hears
about this, he'll want in.

Do you trust him?

It'd be hard to keep him out.
I hear he is as stubborn as you are.

It would be nice when Wayne
manor is rebuilt.

You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse
to not sleeping in a mansion.

Whenever you stich yourself up
you do make a bloody mess.

Yeah. It makes me
learn from my mistakes.

You ought to be pretty
knowledgable by now.

My armor. Carrying too
much weight. I need to be faster.

I'm sure Mr. Fox
can oblige.

Did you get mauled by a tiger?

It was a dog.

Ah?
It was a big dog.

More copycats last night,
Alfred. With guns.

Why don't you hire them
and take a weekend off?

That wasn't... exactly what I had in mind
when I said I wanted to inspire people.

I know.

But things have improved.
Look at the new district attorney.

I am. Closely.

I need to know if he can be trusted.

Are you interested in his character
or... his sexual circle?

Who Rachel spends her time
with is her business.

I trust you don't have
me followed on my day off.

If you ever took
one I might.

Know your limits, Master Wayne.

Batman has no limits.

Well you do, sir.

Well, I can't afford to know them.

What's going to happen on
the day that you find out?

We'll all know how much you
like to say: "I told you so"

On that day, Master Wayne, even
l won't want to. Probably.

Sorry I'm late, folks.

Where were you?

Worried you'd have to step up?

Harvey, I know these
briefs backwards.

Fair's fair.
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

Oh yeah? You want to flip a coin
to see who leads?

It's my father's lucky coin.

As I recall, it got me my
first date with you.

You wouldn't leave something
like that up to chance.

I don't.
I make my own luck.

All rise!
The Honorable Judge Surrillo presiding.

I thought the DA just plays
golf with the mayor or things like that.

Tee-off is 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Salli.

With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, someone must have
stepped up to run this so-called family.

Is that man in this courtroom today?
Could you identify him for us please?

You win, counsellor.

It was me!

I have a sworn statement
from you, that this man,

Salvatore Maroni, is the new
head of the Falcone crime family.

Maroni? He is a fallguy!
I'm the brains of the organization.

Order, order!

Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

Granted.

Hostile?
I'll show you hostile!

Carbon fiber,
.28 caliber, made in China.

If you want to kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni,
l recommend you buy American.

Get him out of here!

But, your honor, I'm not done!

We will never be able to link
the gun to Maroni,

so we won't be able to
charge him, but the fact

they are trying to kill you,
means we are getting to them.

Well I'm glad you're so pleased Rachel.
And I'm fine, by the way.

Come on Harvey, you are Gotham's DA!
If you are not getting shot at,...

you're not doing your job right.

But you know, he said if you were rattled
you could take the rest of the day off.

I can't. I dragged the Head of
the major crimes unit down here.

Jim Gordon? He's a friend actually,
try to be nice!

I hear you got a
hell of a right cross.

It's a shame Sal's gonna walk.

Yeah, well good thing about the mob is...

They keep giving you second chances.

Lightly radiated bills.
Fancy stuff for a city cop.

Have helped?

We have links with various agents...

Save it Gordon, I want to meet him.

Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.

Uhum... And what about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

If you've got problems
with malfunctioning equipment,

I suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor.

I put every known money launderer
in Gotham, behind bars,

but the Mob is still getting its money.

I think you and your friend,
have found the last game in town

and are trying to hit them where it hurts:
their wallets. That's bold.

You gonna count me in?

In this town the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

Gordon, I don't like that you've got your
own special unit and

I don't like that is full of cops
l investigated at internal affairs.

If I had to work with cops you investigated while you
were licking your name at IAIP working alone.

I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

I have to do the best I can
with what I have.

You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure

on five banks without telling
me what we're after?

Well, I can give you
the names of the banks.

Well, that's a start.

I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

You don't have to sell me, Dent. We all
know you're Gotham's white knight.

I heard they have a different name
for me down at MCU.

I wouldn't know about that.

In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

The joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

Well, Mr Lau. I speak
for the rest of the board...

And Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curious
about how his trust fund gets replenished

But frankly...
This is embarrasing!

You worry about the delegace,
Mr. Reese.

I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

It's done.
The numbers are solid.

Do them again. Wouldn't want the
trust fund to run out, now would we?

Another long night? This joint venture
was your idea and the consultants love it.

But I am not convinced. Lau's company
has grown by 8% anually like clockwork.

His revenue stream must be
off the books. It may be even illegal.

OK, cancel the deal.

You already knew?

I just needed a closer look at their books.

Anything else you can trouble me for?

I need a new suit.

Yeah... 3 buttons is a little
90's, Mr. Wayne.

I am not talking fashion
Mr Fox, so much as function.

Want to be able to turn your head?
Sure would make backing out of the driveway easier.

I'll see what I can do.

It took me 3 weeks to
get a reservation here.

And I had to tell them
l work for the government.

Really?

This city health inspector is
not afraid to pull strings.

Rachel!
Fancy that!

Yeah Bruce, fancy that.

Rachel, Natasha.
Natasha, Rachel.

Natasha, are you the...
The prima ballerina from the Moscow ballet.

Wow, Harvey's
taking me next week.

Really?
So you're into ballet?

Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

Well, I certainly hope not.

So, let's put a couple of tables together.

I'm not sure that they'll let us.
Oh they should. I own the place.

How could want to raise children
in a city like this?

Well, I was raised here.
I turned out OK.

Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

The Palisades.

You know as our new DA,

you might want to figure out
where your jurisdiction ends.

I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

Gotham needs heroes
like you, elected officials.

And not a man who
thinks he's above the law.

Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
We did.

All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

But this is a democracy, Harvey.

When their enemies were at the gates,

the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered a public service.

Harvey, the last man that they appointed
to protect the republic was named Caesar,

and he never gave up his power.

OK, fine.
You either die a hero...

or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.

Look. Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to do this for the rest of his life.

Batman is looking for someone
to take up his mantle.

Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

What if Harvey Dent is
the caped crusader?

If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would have noticed by now.

Well... I'm sold that I'm going
to throw you a fundraiser.

That's nice of you Bruce, but
I'm not up for reelection for 3 years.

No, you don't understand.
One fundraiser with my pals,

you'll never need another cent.

What the hell is this?

As you all are aware, one of
our deposits was stolen.

A relatively small amount.
68 million.

Who is stupid enough to steal from us?

2-bit wackjob, wears a cheap
purple suit and makeup.

He's not the problem.
He's a nobody.

The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well placed sources,

we know that police have
indeed identified our banks

using marked bills and are planning
to seize your funds today.

And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business,

I'm your only option.

So what do you propose?

Moving all deposits
to one secure location.

Not a bank.
Where then?

Nobody can know, but me.

If the police were to gain leverage over one
of you, everyone's money would be at stake.

What stop them getting to you?

I go to Hong Kong.
Far from Dent's jurisdiction

And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

How soon can we move the money?

I already have.

For obvious reasons, I couldn't
wait for your permission.

Rest assured your money is safe.

And I thought my
jokes were bad.

Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy here pull your head off.

How about a magic trick?

I'm going to make
this pencil disappear.

Tahdah! It's gone!

Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

You ought to know,
you bought it!

Easy.
I want to hear the opposition.

Let's wind the clock back a year.

These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare
cross any of you.

What happened?
Did your balls drop off?

You see a guy like me...
A freak!

A guy like me..
I know why you choose to have

group therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.

The Batman. Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

Dent, he's just the beginning.

And as for the television's
so-called plan...

The Batman has no jurisdiction.
He'll find him and make him squeal.

I know the squealers when I see them.

What do you propose?
It's simple. We kill the Batman.

If it is so simple why
haven't you done it already?

If you are good thing at something,
never do it for free.

And what you want?

Hm... Half.

Are you crazy!
No I'm not... No, I'm not.

If we don't deal with this now,
soon little Gamble here

won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma.

Enough from the clown!

Let's not blow this out of proportion.

Do you think you can
steal from us and just walk away?

I'm putting a word out: 500 grand
for this clown dead.

A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners first.

Alright, so listen.
Why don't you give me a call when

you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously? Here's my card.

You're a hard man to reach.

Lau is halfway to Hong Kong.

If he had asked,
l could have taken his passport.

I told you to keep me in the loop.

All that was left in the vaults were
marked bills. They knew we were coming.

As soon as your office got involved...

My office?

You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

Oh yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beef.

Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

We need Lau back.

But the Chinese won't extradite
a National under any circumstances.

If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

I'll get him to sing.

We're going after the mob's life savings.

Things will get ugly...

I knew the risk
when I took this job, lieutenant.

How will you get him back...

He does that.

Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.

Well I'm sure you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

What's wrong with a phone call?

I think Mr Lau
deserves a more... personal touch.

Now for high altitude jumps, you're
gonna need oxygen and stabilizers.

But what about getting back into the plane?

I'd recommend a good travel agent.

Without it landing.

Now that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

The ClA had a program back in the 60's for getting
their people out of hot spots called skyhook

You could look into that.
Okay, now.

Hardened Kevlar plates over
titanium-tipped

triweaved fibers for flexibility.

You'll be lighter,
faster, more agile.

Perhaps you should read the instructions first.

Now there is a tradeoff.

Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

We wouldn't want to make
things too easy now, would we?

How will it hold up against dogs?

We talking Rotweilers or Chiuauas?

It should do fine against cats.

I found one in Arizona.

An very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he'd take the cash.

What about a flight crew?

South Korean smugglers; they run flights
into Pyongyang below radar the whole way.

Did you think of an alibi?

Oh, yes.

Presentation cancelled

I believe this is your plane, sir!

You look tired, Alfred.
Will you be all right without me?

If you can tell me the Russian for:
Apply your own bloody suntan lotion.

Yo Gamble, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

And they brought the body.

Dead, that's 500...

How about alive?

You want to know how I
got these scars?

My father was a drinker and a fiend.

One night he goes off
crazier than usual

Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

He does not like that.
Not one bit.

So, me watching, he takes the
knife to her, laughing while he does it.

He turns to me and he says:
Why so serious, son?

He comes at me with the knife...

Why so serious, son? He sticks
the blade in my mouth:

Let's put a smile on that face!

Why so serious?

Now, our operation is small but there is a
lot of potential for aggressive expansion.

So, which of you fine gentleman
would like to join our team?

There's only one spot open right now.

So we're going to
have tryouts?

Make it fast.

Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

Mr Lau regrets he isn't able
to greet you in person today.

I understand.

For security purposes, I'm going to
have to ask you to check in your mobile.

Of course

I must apologize for leaving
Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.

This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force.

I couldn't let such a thing
threaten my company.

Of course.

A businessman of your stature
will understand

that with you here now,
we can continue.

Well I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style Mr Lau...

We do not allow cell phones in here.
Oh sorry, forgot I had it.

I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

We can't afford to be seen to do business
with... whatever it is you're accused of being.

I'm sure a businessman of
your stature will understand.

I think Mr Fox, a
simple phone call might have sufficed.

Mr. Wayne didn't want
you to think that

he was deliberately
wasting your time.

Just accidentally wasting it.

That's very good Mr Lau.
Accidentally, very good.

Hey, sir!

A better view from the train.

How's the view from LSl hallways?
Restricted. Lau has held up the networking tight.

What is this?
I had RND work it up.

It sends out a high frequency pulse
records in response time.

For mapping an environment.

Sonar, just like a...
a submarine, Mr. Wayne.

And the other device?
It's in place.

Mr Wayne, good luck.

Where are the police?

They are coming.

Then what the hell
am I paying them for?

Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.

Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

The money is the only reason
l am still alive.

Oh, you mean when they find out
that you've helped us they're going to kill you?

Are you threatening my client?

No, I'm just assuming your
client's cooperation with this investigation.

As well everyone.

No?
Okay.

Enjoy your time in county Mr Lau.

Wait.
I won't give you the money.

But I will give you my clients.
All of them.

You were a glorified accountant. What could you
possibly have on all of them that we could charge?

I'm good with calculation.
I handled all the investments.

One big pot.

Got it.
One minute.

If they pull their money we can
charge them all as one crew on conspiracy.

Charge them with what?

In a Reiko case, if you can charge one
of the conspirators with a felony, you can...

Charge all of them with it. That's great.

Mr Lau. What kind of details do you
have about this communal fund?

Edgers, notebooks...

Immunity, protection and a
chartered plane back to Hong Kong.

After you testify in open court.

And I'm just curious.
with all your clients locked up,

what's going to happen with all that money?

Like I said, I am
good with calculation.

He can't go to county,
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

What is this Gordon, your fortress?

Do you trust them over at county?
I don't trust them here.

Lau stays.

Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

He would, we should
have hired the clown.

He was right, we have to
fix real problem. Batman.

I'm not aware of any participation
by the Batman in the investigations.

Our boy looks good on the tube

You sure you want to embarrass me
in front of my friends lieutenant?

No, don't worry.
They're coming too.

Have a nice trip. See you in the next fall.

712 counts of extortion,
849 counts of racketeering,

246 counts of fraud,
87 counts of conspiracy, murder...

527 counts of obstruction of justice.
How do the defendants plead?

Order in court.

549 criminals at once. How did you
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

She shares my enthusiasm
for justice. After all she is a Judge.

Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convinctions out of Surrillo,

you're going to set a new record
in appeals for quickest tick in the ass.

It won't matter, the head guys make bail,
sure. But the midlevel guys, they can't.

They can't afford to be off
the streets long enough for trial and appeal,

they'll cut deals that include some jailtime.

Think of all you can do
with 18 months of clean streets.

Mr. Mayor, you can't...

Get out, both of you.

Sit down.

The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

But that means it's on you. They are all going
to come after you now and not just the mob.

Politicians, journalists, cops. Anyone
whose wallet is about to get lighter.

Are you up to it? You better be,
because if they get anything on you

and those criminals are back on the streets...
Followed swiftly by you and me.

I think your fundraiser will
be a great success sir.

And why do you think I want to
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

Well, I assumed it was your
usual reason for socializing

beyond myself and the scum
of Gotham's underbelly.

To try to impress Miss Dawes.

Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.

The police disclosed the footage
found at scene of the body.

Sensitive viewers please be aware:
the image is disturbing.

Tell them your name.
Brian.

Are you the real Batman?
No! No!

Then why do you dress up like him?

He's a symbol... that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you!
Yeah, you do, Brian. You really do!

So you think Batman has
made Gotham a better place?

You see this is how crazy
Batman has made Gotham.

If you want to order in Gotham the Batman
must take off his mask and turn himself in!

And every day he doesn't,
people will die!

Starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.

Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld,
scared stiff by the trust fund brigade.

I'll be back.
Rachel!

A little liquid courage,
Mr Dent?

Alfred, right?
That's right, sir.

Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her for her whole life?

Not yet, sir.

Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
l should be aware of?

Oh, you have no idea!

I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

Now, where is Harvey?
Where is Harvey Dent, the man of the hour!

And where's Rachel Dawes,
she is my oldest friend. Come here.

When Rachel first told me that she was
dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

"The guy that was cut off from those awful campaign
commercials, I believe in Harvey Dent? "

Yeah nice slogan, Harvey.
But you caught Rachel's attention.

Then I started to pay attention to Harvey
and all that he's been doing as our new DA.

And you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.

I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel a little safer.

A little more optimistic.

Look at this face.
This is the face of Gotham's bright future.

To Harvey Dent.
Let's hear it for him.

Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you are making fun of him.

But I do.

No, I meant every word.

You know that day that you once told me about
when Gotham would no longer need Batman?

It's coming.
Bruce...

You can't ask me to wait for that.
It's happening now.

Harvey is that hero.

He locked up half of the city's criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask.

Gotham needs a hero with a face.

You throw a party Wayne, I'll give you that.
Thanks again.

You mind if I borrow Rachel?

Lieutenant, that Joker card
pinned to the body?

Forensics found 3 sets of DNA.

Any matches?
All three.

The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent, and Commissioner Loeb.

The Joker is telling us
who he's targeting.

Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

City Hall.

Seal the building.
No one in or out until I get there.

Got it.

Gordon! What are you up to?
We're secure.

I want a floor by floor
search of the entire building.

Sorry sir, we believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.

These are dangerous people, Judge.

Yes, but you're not
giving me an awful lot of information.

Even we don't know where you're going.
Take the envelope.

Get in, open it. It'll tell
you where you're headed.

You can not leave me alone
with these people.

The whole mob is after you
and you're worried about these guys?

Compared to this,
the mob doesn't scare me.

Gordon, you're unlikely
to discover this for yourself, so..

Take my word, the Police Commissioner
there's a lot of threats.

I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

Yeah, I bet.

Yeah, it makes you think
about things you couldn't stand losing.

About who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

It's a pretty big commitment.

Well, not if the Mob has their way.

It'd be good to explain to my wife
why I'm late for dinner tonight.

Sir, the Joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

Don't do that.
Alright. Let's be serious then.

Okay.
What's your answer?

I don't have an answer.

How'd they get my DNA?

Somebody with access to your
office or your house

must have lifted a tissue
or a glass...

Wait!

I guess the answer is no.
Harvey...

It's someone else, isn't it?
Harvey!

Just tell me it's not Wayne,
the guy's a complete…

What are you doing?

Get a medic!

We made it!

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

We are tonight's entertainment!

I only have one question.

Where is Harvey Dent?

You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

Hands up, pretty boy!

Do you know where I can find Harvey?

I need to talk to him about something,
something little.

No...

What's going on out there?
Wayne!

Ah, thank God you've
got a panic room. Wait!

You got to be kidding me.

You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
We're not intimidated by thugs!

You know, you remind me of my father.

I hated my father!
Okay stop!

Well, hello beautiful!
You must be Harvey's squeeze!

And you are beautiful.

You look nervous.
Is it the scars?

You want to know how I got them?

Come here.
Hey!

Look at me.

So I had a wife, beautiful, like you,

who tells me I worry too much.
Who tells me I ought to smile more.

Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks

One day, they carve her face.
And we have no money for surgeries.

She can't take it.
I just want to see her smile again, hmm?

I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

So... I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this... to myself

And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves.

Now I see the funny side.
Now I'm always smiling!

A little fight in you.
I like that.

Then you're going to love me.

Drop the gun.
Oh, sure!

You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are.

Let her go.
Very poor choice of words!

Are you alright?

Let's not do that again...

Is Harvey okay?
He's safe.

Thank you

Jim, it's over!

As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

But the prosecution is over!

Nobody's standing up in front of a judge while judges
and police commissioners are getting blown away.

What about Dent?

If he's got any sense,
Dent's halfway to Mexico.

So where do you keep your trash?

You're due at court.

I need you alive long enough
to get you under record.

You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

If you refuse to cooperate you're
not coming back here, you go to county.

How long you calculate
you'll last in there?

Targeting me won't get
their money back.

I knew the mob wouldn't go down
without a fight, but this is different.

They've crossed the line.
You've crossed the line first, sir

You squeezed them, you hammered
them to the point of desperation.

In their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

Criminals aren't complicated Alfred.

We just need to figure out what he's after.

With respect, master Wayne, perhaps this
is a man you don't fully understand either.

A long time ago I was in Burma.

My friends and I were working
for the local government.

They were trying to buy the
loyalty of tribal leaders by

bribing them with precious stones.

But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Yangoon by a bandit.

So, we went looking for the stones.

But in 6 months we never met
anyone who traded with him.

One day, I saw a child playing with
a ruby the size of a tangerine.

The bandit had been throwing them away.
So why steal them?

Well, because he thought
it was good sport.

Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned, or negotiated with.

Some men just want
to watch the world burn.

Get the names.

Richard Dent
Patrick Harvey

Harvey Dent.

I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

Us contaminate it? It's because
of you these guys are dead...

Detective!

Just a minute guys.

It's brick underneath.

You going to take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

No.
Fingerprints.

Obituaries.
Mayor Anthony Garcia.

Whatever you're going to do,
do it fast.

Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

I'm not sure you
made it loud enough, sir.

What can I do for you Mr Reese?

You wanted me to do the
diligence on the LSl holdings deal again.

Well, I found some irregularities.
Our CEO is in police custody.

No, not with their numbers
With yours.

Applied sciences.

A whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared, overnight.

I went down to the archives and
l started pulling some old files.

Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby out there

pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

Now you got the entire RND
department burning through cash

claiming it's related
to cellphones for the army?

What are you building for
him now, a rocket ship?

I want 10 million dollars
a year for the rest of my life.

Let me get this straight.

You think that your client, one of the
wealthiest, most powerful men in the world

is secretly a vigilante, who spends his
nights beating criminals to a pulp...

... with his bare hands.
And your plan is to blackmail this person?

Good luck.

Keep that.

This is your original scan.

Here it is re-engineered.

And there's the thumbprint he left when
he pushed the round in the clip.

I'll get you a copy.

Mr. Wayne, did you reassign RND?

Yes, government
telecommunications project.

I wasn't aware we had any
government contracts.

Lucius, I'm playing
this one pretty close to the chest.

Fair enough.

With no word from the Batman.
Even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb.

These cops have to be wondering
if the Joker will make good on

his threat in the obituary column of
the Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

Cross reference the addresses. Look
for Park Side, overlooking the parade.

I got one! Melvin White,
1502 Randalf Apartments

Aggravated his soul,
moved to Arkham twice.

How many you got on the roof?

We're tight but frankly
there's a lot of windows up here!

Commissioner Loeb
dedicated his life to

law enforcement and to
the protection of his community.

I remember when I first took office,

I asked him if
he wanted to stay on as Commissioner and...

Clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been

A number of policies that
he enacted were unpopular.

Policies that flooded
my office with angry calls and letter...

Who is it?
What happened?

They took our guns and uniforms.

We must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

Standby, Honor, Guard, Atten-hut.

Ready

Aim

Fire!

Ready, aim...

Ready, aim...

Get him out!

I'll see you later!
Why are you coming back?

Get out!

Tell me what you
know about the Joker.

No!
I'm sorry Barbara.

Junior, go play with
your sister, go ahead.

If there is anything that
l can do, we're here for you.

Are you happy.. Are you
You brought this craziness on us... You did!

Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't want to talk to us.

May God help whoever
he does want to talk to.

Can we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

Why makes you think
l want to hear you talk?

What?

Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

I'm where you should be at MCU
I'm trying to deal with all this mess.

Can I get the fingerprint analysis?

Rachel, listen to me.
You're not safe there.

Oh, this is Gordon's unit.
Gordon's gone, Rachel.

He vouched for these men.
And he's gone.

The Joker has named you next.

Is there anyone in this
town we can trust?

Bruce.
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

No Rachel, I know
you're his friend but...

Harvey, Trust me.

Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

Then you go straight there. Don't tell
anybody where you're going. I'll find you there.

I love you.

I want the Joker.

From one professional to another, if you're
trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.

From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

I'm counting on it.

Where is he?

I don't know where he is.
He found us.

He must have friends.
Friends? Have you met this guy?

Someone knows where he is!
Nobody's going to tell you nothing.

He was right.
You got rules. The Joker...

He's got no rules.
Nobody's going to cross him for you.

If you want this guy, you got one way.
But you already know what that is.

Just take off that mask
let him come find you.

Or are you going to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up your mind.

You want to play games?

How's that feel?

Don't kill...
I wouldn't?

You don't think I will?
You don't think I will?

No, I wouldn't.

That's why I'm not going
to leave it up to me.

Heads, you get to keep your head.
Tails, not so lucky.

So, you want to tell me about the Joker?

Let's go again.
I don't know anything, I don't!

You're not playing the odds, friend.
Let's do it again.

You'd leave a man's life to chance?
Not exactly.

His name is Shif, Thomas.

He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

The kind of mind
that Joker attracts.

What do you expect to learn from him?

The Joker killed Gordon.
He's going to kill Rachel!

You are the symbol of hope
l could never be.

Your stand against organized
crime is the first

legitimate ray of light in
Gotham in decades.

If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

All the criminals you pulled off
the streets would be released

and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

You're going to hold a press
conference tomorrow morning.
Why?

No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands now.

You can't.
You can't give in.

You can't give in!

Harvey called.
He said Batman's going to turn himself in.

I have no choice.

Do you honestly think that's going to
keep the Joker from killing people?

Maybe not, but I have
enough blood on my hands.

I have seen now what I would have to
become to stop a man like him.

You once told me that if
the day came when I...

was finished, then we would be together.

Bruce, don't make me your
one hope for a normal life.

Did you mean it?

Yes.

If you turn yourself in, they're
not going to let us be together.

Logs as well?
Everything.

Anything that can
lead back to Lucius or Rachel.

People are dying Alfred.
What would you have me do?

Endure... master Wayne.
Take it.... They'll hate you for it.

But that's the point of Batman,
he can be the outcast.

He can make the choice that
no one else can make, the right choice.

Well today I found out what Batman can't do.
He can't endure this.

Today you get to say
"I told you so."

Today, I don't want to.

But I did bloody tell you.

I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
As your accomplice...

Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for coming.

I've called this
press conference for two reasons.

Firstly, to assure
the citizens of Gotham that

everything that can be done over
the Joker killings is being done.

Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

But first, let's consider the situation.

Should we give into
this terrorist's demands?

Do we really think that...
Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante

... than the lives of citizens?

The Batman is an outlaw.

But that's not why
we're demanding he turn himself in.

We're doing it because we're scared.

We've been happy to let the Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

Things are worse than ever!

Yes they are...

But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

And I promise you...
the dawn is coming.

One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken.

But to us, not to this madman!

No more dead cops!

He should turn himself in!

So be it.
Take the Batman into custody.

I am the Batman.

Alfred!

Why is he letting Harvey do this?

He went down to the press conference.
I know, and he just stoodby!

Perhaps both Bruce and
Mr. Dent believe the Batman

stands for something more important than
the whims of a terrorist, Ms. Dawes.

Even if everyone hates him for it.

That's a sacrifice he's making.

He's not being a hero.
He is being something more.

Yeah, you're absolutely right. Letting Harvey
take the fall for this is not heroic at all.

You know him better than anyone.
I do.

Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right.

How will I know?
It's not sealed.

Bye Alfred.

Goodbye Rachel.

Sorry, I didn't have time
to talk this through with you...

What are you doing?

They're transferring me
to Central holding.

This is the Joker's chance. And when
he attacks, the Batman will take him down.

Listen to me, this is too dangerous!

We get this guy to county,
he's their problem.

The streets will be cleared
along your route. Let's go!

Lieutenant, the convoy stops for no reason!

I hope you got some moves pal.

He's using you as bait. He doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker.

He's failed so far.
How do you know what he's looking for?

I just, I do!

Anyway Harvey,
this isn't just about you.

What about all the people who are depending on
you to clean the city up and to do it honorably?

Harvey, tell everyone the truth.

Heads, I go through with it.

This is your life! You can't leave
something like that to chance.

I'm not.

You make your own luck.

Hey! You wait like
everyone else, pal.

What the hell is that?
Obstruction ahead! Obstruction ahead!

Damn it! All units, divert down onto
lower 5th. I repeat, exit down.

Exit down!
Lower 5th? We'll be like
turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.

Come on. Get us out of here.
Let's go

Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

We got trouble, guys.

Lock and load!

What the hell was that?

These things were
built for that, right?

He's going to need something
a lot bigger to get through this.

What is that?

What is that? A bazooka!

I didn't sign up for this!

Look out.

Down!

Come on! Let's go!

Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent!
Excuse me, I want to drive.

Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

We got to get topside.
We need air support now.

I like this job! I like it!

Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

Goodbye.

We're on point! Ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

That's what I'm talking about.
Aircabs.

Okay! Rack 'em up, rack 'em up,
rack 'em up!

That's not good.

Okay, That's not good!
