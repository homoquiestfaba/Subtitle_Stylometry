("Black Lipstick Kiss" by Random Order)

â™ª Picture this

â™ª Black lipstick kiss

Will you let me?

â™ª Blood red wine

Um.

Think it'd be really sexy if you let me.

â™ª Black fingernails

Ah, maybe I could try you first.

[Jill] Okay.

Okay.

Ah, hold it up higher.

The air cools the wax on the way down.

Okay.

[Jill] Careful of the floor.

Maybe I shouldn't.

Please?

â™ª All over your soul

Oh yeah, that's good.

[Jamie] Yeah?

Yeah, do it again.

Mm.

Oh wow, is that a, that's a tarp?

You're prepared?

Do you want to lay down

and I'll try some on you?

Um, how about you go first?

Okay.

â™ª Love to love to hate to love

â™ª Love to love to hate to love

â™ª Love to love to hate to love

â™ª Don't want any ups

â™ª I don't want any downs

â™ª I want everything to be the same

So that was exotic.

You know, if you buy candles,

you should buy the white ones because the dye

makes them burn at a higher temperature

and it's hotter on the skin.

Oh.

Same with the scented, stay away from those.

You sound like an expert.

Well I picked up a few things in the BDSM scene.

Hey, you know what

we should get-- - Wait, what?

When I lived in San Francisco.

I told you.

I went to some clubs.

I thought they were lesbian clubs.

Well some were.

But the community is so small there

that there's a lot of crossover--

So what did you do there?

I mean, did you, did you BDSM with a lot of people?

Did you, did you like it?

Do you want to go back?

Do you miss it?

There's nowhere I'd rather be right now

than here with you.

Yeah but I mean, you didn't answer all my questions.

What's it like?

Um, it's um,

it has its moments,

but it's mostly just a lot of people in the kitchen

eating snacks.

There's snacks?

Mm hmm.

("Death to Vanilla Sex" by Count Boogie)

â™ª Everybody's got a kink

â™ª You might have two or three I think

â™ª Ah ooh

â™ª I enjoy it when you scream

â™ª There is no need to be discrete

â™ª Ah ooh

â™ª Well you can't play with the china doll

â™ª So what's the fun in that

â™ª Why stop with just one flavor

â™ª When there's more that you can get

â™ª And if you want to be a bore in bed

â™ª You cannot be my pet

â™ª Cause I say death to vanilla sex

[Woman] Ah, again.

(gentle jazzy music)

I mean, I don't want to be one of those gay guys

who complains that there are no decent gay guys to date,

but come on!

[Lola] You're looking for a guy to date?

What, you just come in without knocking?

Jamie and I know each other well enough

to skip formalities.

What if she's having sex?

Well then she would be remiss,

because today is our first bi-weekly friend date.

So what, I have to go now?

You didn't tell me she was coming over.

[Jamie] I forgot.

[David] Why don't we have a bi-weekly friend date?

I see you almost every day.

[David] Yeah but we never go anywhere.

Well if you're looking to be set up,

I know a guy you might like.

Oh yeah?

Sweet, hook me up.

[Lola] Yeah, I'll talk to him about it.

Well, I guess I'll leave you two

to your ex-girlfriend friend date.

[Jamie] You can stay if you want.

I should probably go anyway,

but I'll see you soon for our new special day!

So what's new?

[Jamie] Not much.

How's Jill?

[Jamie] Good.

Good, you're happy.

Very happy.

How's ah, what's his name?

Sebastian, he's good.

We're good.

We're opening up our relationship

so he can have a boyfriend.

Oh, wow.

That's, yikes.

No, it's good.

I'm up for it.

I want him to do what's in his heart.

Doesn't it make you feel like you're not enough for him?

[Lola] No, it's not like that.

That's how I would feel.

Well if you're insecure in your relationship,

that insecurity will be there with or without monogamy.

I'm not insecure.

[Lola] No, I'm speaking hypothetically.

Yeah, I know.

I mean, she decided to move in with you,

so I thought things were going well.

Yeah, things are going really well.

She's just subletting, but even so.

[Lola] Oh, she's subletting.

Yeah, I mean, it's not a big deal.

She makes a little bit of money.

[Lola] Does she?

Not really.

Has she tried redecorating?

No.

[Lola] Huh.

But that's okay.

I mean, there's no rush.

Less pressure on me, you know.

(gentle jazzy music)

Look what I got!

Yeah?

You like any of these?

I thought we could get some curtains.

Yeah, sure whatever you want, babe.

Yeah?

I thought maybe you'd want to give the room

a feminine touch.

Make the place feel more like home.

You know what would make it feel more like home?

Ooh, we can get one of those crystals

that projects rainbows!

And we'll open the curtains during the day,

and at night we will close them!

Sure, that's an option.

But I was thinking more like you could cuddle with me

while we watch TV.

Or you know what we could do?

We could cuddle, after we have sex on the floor

with whipped cream and candle wax and--

I'm on my period.

That doesn't have to stop us, right?

I mean, some people like that whole tribal quality,

you know, I mean, we could be those people, right?

Jill, do you love me?

Of course I do.

I think we should go to a BDSM club.

After you tell me what BDSM stands for.

Huh?

We don't need to go to a club.

We can have all the fun we want right here.

You're watching TV.

Well, if you be quiet and cuddle with me

while we watch The Real Lesbians of Northampton,

maybe you'll see how much fun we can have.

[Woman On TV] I know what you're capable of doing,

I know it.

Admit it, you're cheating on me, I know.

[Woman On TV] Well what do you want me to do?

Have boring vanilla sex with you

when there's women out there who would kill

to have a piece of this?

[Woman On TV] Oh yeah?

Well, what about a piece of this?

Or this?

(Jill laughing)

Am I not good enough for you any more,

is that what it is?

Isn't this fun?

[Woman On TV] Too little too late!

Too little too late!

So, can we go to a club?

I want to see what it's like.

Sure.

(gentle jazzy music)

Sebastian?

David!

Lola's told me so much about you.

Oh yeah?

All good, I hope?

Of course.

I hope you don't mind I picked a vegan place.

Not at all.

I love veganisms.

The crab cakes here are amazing.

Yeah but if you're a vegan,

why do you want to eat something that tastes like crab?

Well I'm not vegan because I don't like the taste of crab.

It's more of an ethical, social, political,

environmental, and spiritual decision.

Uh huh.

I guess there are some things I'll never understand.

I like that about you.

You like me?

[Sebastian] I like how real you are.

Oh, thanks.

I try, I mean, I don't try.

I just am.

I don't know how many people I've gone out with

that just pretend to agree with me,

even if they didn't.

But you see, I have this ability

to see right through people.

So, how do you know Lola?

I thought she told you.

Lola's my girlfriend.

Oh.

Oh.

Oh!

[Sebastina] I'm looking for a man to date.

In addition to--

Yes, in addition to Lola.

So you're looking for a third?

No, no, no, a separate relationship.

One that Lola is aware of and accepts

and understands and one that my boyfriend is aware of

and accepts and understands.

I know it's not for everyone.

Yeah, I could see that.

I'll be right back.

(phone ringing)

[Lola] Hello?

Are you fucking kidding me?

David, calm down.

[David] Why didn't you tell me?

I thought after you met him,

you'd be more open minded about it.

I guess not.

You guess not?

First of all, I don't want to date a man

who has sex with other people.

Second of all, I don't want to date a man

who has sex with women.

Third of all, I don't want to date a man who has sex

with my best friend's ex-girlfriend,

and fourth of all, I do not want to date a man

who has sex with you!

Listen, he's a really cool guy,

and I thought you were a really cool guy.

Having sex with him would be like having sex with you!

You're right, David.

Polyamory isn't for everyone.

It requires maturity and thoughtfulness.

(smooth jazzy music)

Bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadomasochism.

That's too many words.

[Jill] The D and the S double for two different words.

You can't have a four-letter acronym

that stands for six words.

You can stare, but not talk or touch.

I hate it when people stare at me.

[Jill] Nobody's going to be staring at you.

They're going to be staring at something interesting.

I'm interesting.

Unless you're tied to the ceiling in saran wrap,

you're not interesting.

You've done that?

[Jill] It's awesome.

And that's sexy?

Give it time, you'll see.

Some people use pseudonyms.

Sally.

[Jill] Huh?

I've already thought about it.

My pseudonym is Sally.

Oh, I was thinking something more like Spike or Wicked.

Like the musical?

No, see Sally is perfect because it makes me anonymous,

but at the same time,

people will think my name is really Sally,

because why the hell would I choose that?

Right because the name Sally is a boner killer.

And if people think my name is really Sally,

it shows that I'm not afraid of exposing my real identity,

and that makes me cool.

(playful instrumental music)

So, this is it?

[Jill] You ready?

I mean, this is it?

These places all look pretty low key from the outside.

Okay, so this is it.

Yeah I mean, there's nothing wrong

with abandoned warehouses.

Spacious, affordable.

Kind of sexy in the right fantasy.

Plus I heard the BDSM keeps serial killers away.

So, yeah, I'm ready.

We don't have to go.

[Jamie] But I want to.

They're not abandoned.

No, I'm sure there's some meth heads around.

[Jill] They're warehouses, they manufacture things.

Yeah, like meth.

I mean, I'm not judging.

We don't have to do this.

[Jamie] But you want to, right?

Well, since we're here.

Of course, since we're here.

It'll be fun.

Well, hi guys, are you members?

Oh no, it's our first time.

Oh well welcome, my name's Princess.

I have some paperwork for you guys.

She's not very scary.

She's not supposed to be.

So anti-climatic.

Alright, that's for you.

There you go.

Waiver of liability,

binding arbitration, assumption of risk?

It's just a formality.

Well then it's a formality that my lawyer

should look over, and I can't give this to my lawyer

because she probably would prosecute for this.

And bill me for it.

Is this illegal?

Well, technically BDSM is considered assault.

And unfortunately the law does not recognize

the consensual aspect of these particular activities.

So that's a yes?

Some people say that LGBT rights are the last wave

of civil rights to be legalized,

but we here beg to differ.

And sometimes we just like to beg.

Do cops raid this place?

Only the kinky kind.

We have a uniform night every month.

It is hot!

There's everyone, there's military, cops,

pilgrims, it's Indians,

it's absolutely completely not culturally cool,

but it's still hot.

I'm never going to be able to run for office.

[Princess] We have flight attendants, priests--

I'm never going to be able to be a priest!

All our files are strictly confidential.

Let's just go.

Why?

Isn't it obvious?

Well I mean, I don't really want to run for President.

And priesthood is overrated.

Yeah, that's right, Jamie.

Or else you might actually have a point.

Sally.

[Jill] You're not Sally yet.

Sounds like a challenge.

It's not a challenge and I'm not in the mood.

Well, what gets you in the mood?

BDSM?

'Cause you know, I know a club nearby,

within walking distance.

We might end up being investigated under the Patriot Act,

but you know just think,

the stories that we can tell our children someday.

I always thought we'd keep this a secret

from our children.

Yeah, I was just saying that.

Right, if we even have kids.

Exactly.

No pressure.

We've got time.

Initial there, initial there.

Turn it over and initial.

(upbeat electronic music)

Let's go get some snacks.

(whimsical instrumental music)

Stop staring.

You said I could stare.

Yeah, out there, not in the kitchen.

I don't see the difference.

You guys must be new here.

No.

[Jill] Yes.

I'm Mistress Chyenne.

[Jill] Nice to meet you, I'm Jill and this is--

Mistress Sally.

Uh, you can call me Sally.

Welcome, and if you need anything, just let me know.

This friendliness is creeping me out.

And if there's anyone you want to play with--

No, we just came to watch.

Or, not watch, um, we came for the snacks.

Well if you change your mind, I know everyone in here,

so just let me know and maybe I can fix you up.

[Bob] Ooh, cupcakes!

Yes!

How was your guys' scene?

It was awesome.

You know I'm perfecting my aim,

so right now what I do is I just make cracking noises

with the whip without touching him.

Oh, it drives him crazy.

Well you know what I said Bob,

if you need to practice on someone

you can have my slave.

She has a very high pain tolerance.

Nothing phases her.

I'm going to take you up on that.

Or you can have this one here.

She's kidding, right?

Yeah, she's kidding.

Maybe we should go.

After I finish these chips.

Let's sit.

Well you'd think for 20 bucks the snacks

would be a little better.

So, what do you think so far?

It's intriguing.

[Jill] Does that mean we don't have to stay

in here all night?

What's wrong with in here?

Because if you're satisfied with your $20 chips,

I'm going to go hang out in the main room

and I'll be back in an hour.

You're not leaving me!

Oh yeah?

What if I order you to stay?

You can't order me.

Order you to stay in here or drag you around

on a leash out there.

No one's wearing leashes here!

[Jill] All the more reason to make you.

If we bring a leash next time, I'm putting it on you.

We'll see about that.

(gentle instrumental music)

[Instructor] Take a deep breath in your nose,

and exhale through your mouth.

That woman will stop at nothing!

It's bad enough we have to compete for your affection,

we have to have the same boyfriend too?

Oh, I don't have much affection for Lola.

What is wrong with that woman?

Then to say that I don't have the maturity

to go through with it!

I'll show her, she can't intimidate me out of this!

[Class] Ohm.

[Instructor] Good, take this moment

to reflect on yourself.

See, isn't this nice?

Yeah, lovely.

Sebastian says yoga helps align himself with the universe.

I'm so glad he's inspired you to be a better man.

I bet Lola doesn't take you to yoga on your friend dates.

No.

But Jill takes me to BDSM clubs.

What?

You guys go to sex clubs?

No, there's no sex.

How can it be a sex club if there's no sex?

It's not a sex club!

Shh!

Creepy.

(gentle jazzy music)


Hey.

Hey!

It's from my garden.

Oh, it's ah, lovely.

Thank you.

[Sebastian] It's cilantro.

I know what it is.

[Sebastian] I'm glad you wanted to see me again.

Of course.

You're a cool guy, I'm a cool guy,

this is fun.

Most guys run screaming

when I tell them I have a girlfriend.

That's understandable.

Polygamy isn't ah, you know, for--

Polyamory.

Polyamory.

That's what I said, isn't it?

Sounds like you've been watching too many specials

on Mormons.

(both laughing)

Yeah, ah, this is different.

Right?

Anything is what we make of it.

We get to choose, Mr. David Cho, what we make of it.

Exactly my point.

As I was saying, polyamory isn't for everyone.

It requires maturity and thoughtfulness,

both of which I have massive amounts of.

It means love.

Huh?

Amory, it means love.

Poly means many.

Many loves.

That's beautiful.

Do you love Lola?

Love is the ultimate goal in every human interaction.

For me anyway.

You want some wine?

I'd love some, thank you.

So, do you two have any rules I should know about?

Honesty and respect are our only rules.

So, what would be your honest response

if I were to respectfully ask if you preferred penis

or vagina?

My honest response would be that I think the question

is inherently flawed.

[David] Just testing.

Because as you know, men and women cannot be reduced

to their mere genitalia.

And furthermore, human beings can't be reduced

to their gender.

You took the words right out of my mouth.

Of course, there are many differences between men

and women, and I love and cherish those differences,

which is why I like to have a nice balance

of yin and yang in my life.

Yes, yoga helps me get in touch

with my inner yin and yang.

[Sebastian] Oh, you do yoga?

I didn't tell you?

Yes, my friend Jamie and I do yoga together.

She's not that good, but we all need to start somewhere.

Like Lola.

She just started recently, she said I inspired her.

Oh really, hmm.

(whimsical instrumental music)

Those are paddles.

That's just a neck massager.

I have a few different floggers.

Did you want to see what they feel like?

Maybe later.

I could give you a neck massage first.

No.

It's different for everyone, but for me,

it's not just about the sensation.

It's about the dynamic,

the power exchange.

One person having all the power,

and the other person giving it up.

Like I say, maybe later.

And you say, no, you suck it up, bitch!

Kinda.

Except I want to be the one that says,

you suck it up, bitch!

Okay.

Take off your shirt so you can see what these feel like.

I don't need to take my shirt off to say,

suck it up, bitch.

You'll learn through experience.

Take off your shirt.

(Jamie sighing)

We're going to do a simple scene, okay?

So if you have anything to say,

speak now or forever hold your peace.

What's my safe word.

[Jill] You don't need a safe word,

I'm going to take it easy on you.

Well what happens if I go into subspace?

I know how to do internet research.

This is a light test run.

You're not going to have enough endorphins going

to go into subspace.

Now turn around.

Wait, I can still be the butch one if we do this, right?

Yeah.

Okay, cool.

Can you feel this?

Barely.

That's because you didn't take your shirt off!

I'm keeping it on!

That doesn't mean I can't give you shit about it,

now be quiet!

I can talk.

You can only scream unless I ask you a question.

This is a bunny flogger.

It's a sensual flogger, good for a warm-up.

Meh.

No talking unless I ask you a question.

This one is suede.

You always aim for the fleshy part at the top of the back,

avoiding the spine and the kidneys.

Now on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most pain,

how much pain are you in?

Two?

Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

This one is leather.

There are two kinds of pain, good pain and bad pain.

Good pain is like when you get a good massage.

Bad pain is like when you're hurt.

It's all about exploring and exploiting the good pain.

Now where are we on the scale?

Um, three?

Yeah? How about now?

Safe word!

Uh, sorry, that was fine.

Um, I think it was a four.

You can continue.

Rule number one, always leave them wanting more.

(smooth, jazzy music)


That must be Lola.

She's early.

Huh?

I invited her for dinner.

You shouldn't have.

Hi David.

Hi.

[Sebastian] Can I get you guys a drink?

Please.

[Lola] Yes, thank you.

What are you doing here?

Sebastian invited me for dinner.

And you knew I was going to be here?

Yeah, he said he had a new recipe to try.

Did you tell him I hate new recipes?

You're tense.

He's got a really nice place.

You haven't been here before.

My place is closer.

Closer to what.

Closer to me.

Have you been here?

No, because my place is closer to me!

Okay then.

Sounds like someone could use a drink.

Or a handjob.

Okay, that's really none of your business,

but just in case it might be,

I don't need the latter because my sex life with Sebastian

is very satisfying.

Do you know what that means?

That means one, two, three times an hour!

What about you?

Well, it's not a competition but--

[Davod] Or is it?

Our sex life is very satisfying.

[David] Are we talking one, two, three times

an hour satisfying?

It's quality, not quantity.

Well does it bother you that ours is quality and quantity?

David, it's not a competition.

Sex with a man and sex with a woman

are completely different things.

[David] Yeah, you would know.

Yes, I would know.

So it's not a competition because sex with a man is better

and that's why you're banging Sebastian and not some girl?

And that's why Sebastian is banging me, or rather,

I'm banging him more times than he's banging you.

No, it's not a competition

because they're both different experiences.

One isn't better than the other.

That's what it means to be bisexual,

or did Sebastian not properly explain that?

I know what it means to have sex with two different people

with one person being better, okay.

And Sebastian told me, he's not bisexual,

he's sexually fluid,

You don't even know what the difference is.

Nobody does!

Here you go.

I'd like to make a toast.

To two beautiful people in my life.

It means so much to me to have both of you here together

this evening.

Despite that our relationships are separate

from one another,

the fact that you guys are friends,

that inspired me to bring us here together,

and I couldn't be happier.

(glasses clinking)

This is interesting beer.

[Sebastian] It's homemade Kombucha.

I love it, lots of healthy probiotics.

Is there alcohol in this?

Just a slight trace.

If you drink it quick enough, you might be able to feel it.

You guys ready for dinner?

Everything is raw, this is my raw lasagna.

Here you go.

It's made out of thinly sliced zucchini for the noodles,

and then pureed cashews for the cheese.

[Lola] Oh, I've had this before, it's rich but delicious.

So, this is just vegetables with nuts?

Yeah, I call it raw-sagna.

Mmm, this is fantastic.

Thank you.

It's kind of labor intensive but it's worth it.

I bet if you just made a salad with nuts, it'd be quicker.

This is better, try it.

Mmm, this is good.

[Sebastian] I'm glad you like it.

More Kombucha?

No thanks.

[Lola] Please.

Actually, I'd love some more.

So, while Lola and I have dated a few weeks longer

than David and I,

we're all on the same page

in terms of sexual encounters.

And, since I haven't had sex with either one of you yet,

I thought, why don't we do something truly memorable?

Wouldn't it be incredible if we all had sex together?

I'm in.

Me too.

Wonderful.

To us!

No you're not.

Sure I am.

You've never even been with a woman before.

Can't be that hard.

We don't climax if we don't feel mentally

and emotionally connected.

What do I care.

To us.

To us!

[Jill] What are you doing?

Just cuddling.

Stop moving.

I gotta get up.

Are you gonna make breakfast for us?

No, I'm gonna mow the lawn.

Before breakfast?

Yeah, it's happened.

[Jill] What's wrong?

Nothing.

Cuddle with me.

You sure went to bed early last night.

Oh, yeah.

I was hoping we could continue the fun when we got home.

Yeah, next time we'll have to do that.

So there's going to be a next time?

Yeah, I mean, you want to go back?

[Jill] Yeah, I want to go back.

And then take you home

to fuck you like you've never been fucked before.

She was trying to cuddle me from behind this morning!

She's starting to become the butch one, David!

[David] Jill's always been the butch one.

How can she be the butch one?

I'm the one who straps it on!

[David] Not for long.

God, what am I going to do?

What's the big fuckin' deal anyway?

So Jill's the butch one.

Surprise, you're the last fuckin' one to know!

Don't take yourself so seriously.

Oh, that's really funny coming from you.

You should try meditating.

Meditating to make me more butch?

I don't think that would work,

but it will help ground you and put things into perspective.

Sebastian does it every morning, afternoon, and night.

He says it helps him get through long bouts of chastity.

But that's a whole other story.

So you guys haven't had sex yet?

The date is approaching.

Did you put it on your calendar?

Yes, I did.

She can not win.

She can not win.

She can not win.

[Jamie And David] She can not win.

She can not win.

She can not win!

She can not win!

(upbeat electronic music)

Okay, so, I'm gonna take this real easy on you,

because I don't think you can handle it.

Put this on!

Hurry it up!

These too!

Okay, nevermind, forget about it!

Now, uh, lick my boot!

Jamie--

[Jamie] Sally!

That's Master Sally!

Master Sally--

[Jamie] Thigh Master Sally!

Thigh Master Sally, I can't see your boot.

Then find it!

I didn't tell you that you could get up,

now get back down there!

Jamie--

That's Master Sally!

Master Sally, you know every relationship

is based on trust.

[Jamie] Thigh Master Sally!

And trust is based on communication.

Now get back down there and give me ten leg lifts,

because they don't call me the Thigh Master for nothing!

You're not a Dom, you can't fool me.

Jill, you're ruining the scene.

That's Mistress Jill to you,

now get down there and kiss my feet!

What do you say?

Um, I love your sanitary feet?

Thank you, Mistress.

Oh, thank you, Mistress.

[Jill] I can't hear you.

Thank you, Mistress!

Come here.

(Jamie sighing)

Hello?

[Jamie] Do you have any idea what time it is?

[Lola] We have our yoga date, remember?

Ugh, do we have to?

Rough night, huh?

I don't get the appeal.

You just do yoga to impress Sebastian,

as if he's going to fuck you extra hard because of it.

So, rough night.

I had a great night.

Sometimes rough is great.

[Jamie] You don't need to know any details.

I'm not asking details.

Good.

So why did you set David up with Sebastian

when you guys hate each other?

We don't hate each other.

Is that what he said?

No, I just know both of you.

We don't hate each other.

And if Sebastian's going to date a guy,

I want to have control over the situation.

And I can control David.

Wow, how very insecure of you.

It's smart.

Especially now with the threesome.

I don't,

I don't understand.

He didn't tell you.

You had sex with David?

No!

We have a pending date for a threesome

that he's going to back out of.

Why didn't he tell you?

Because I would yell at him!

No, it's because he's bluffing

and he didn't want you to tell me.

I don't think that he's bluffing, Lola.

He said he put some sex date on his calender

and then he started meditating.

That poser!

I started meditating!

What, you guys both can't meditate?

That's not the point!

He's only doing it because he found out I'm doing it,

and he doesn't want to lag behind.

Well it doesn't sound like you meditated this morning

and no offense, but you probably should have.

Here, let me get it.

I got it.

Here.

Just sit down and relax.

(slow jazzy music)

Here, let me get it.

Do you have to do everything all the time?

That's not what I meant.

It's my romantic dinner I cooked.

I want to treat you,

like a lady.

More wine?

Please, thank you.

Here is to our first month living together!

Yeah, it's been an adventure.

Uh, very interesting, but great, fantastic adventure.

These are for the food, right?

Suck it up, bitch!

I said suck it up, you little pansy ass!

You little cry baby!

This is just a wimpy bunny flogger!

A bunny died to make this!

Have some respect!!

[Jill] Cute pig.

Hey!

[Jill] Is that yours?

Uh, we weren't close.

You can practice on me, you know.

[Jamie] I just, I want to get better first.

Yeah?

Is he giving you good feedback?

Well, he lets me be the butch one

without giving me shit about it.

[Jill] Topping has nothing to do with being butch.

Yeah, says you.

Yeah, says me, your girlfriend.

Besides, maybe I like things the way they are.

Which way is that?

I think you know what I mean.

I can't believe I've never experienced something

so amazing and beautiful before.

What about me?

I'm amazing and beautiful.

You are.

Hey, um, can we take a rain check?

I just, I'm just really tired.

Yeah, okay.

What the fuck?

I don't know, just take it.

Cool, this will be perfect.

Hey Lola, ready for our threesome?

I never have sex without my micro claws.

[Jamie] I can't believe you didn't tell me.

Are you kidding?

I never thought it would get this far.

[Jamie] Yeah but you're not going to go through with it,

are you?

Yeah, with the micro claws.

That's why I'm bringing them.

[Jamie] You know what I mean, if it didn't scare her off.

Listen I may be competitive, but I'm not stupid.

So that's a no, right?

Yes.

Yes, that's a no!

What does it matter to you?

It's just weird.

So is this.

[Jamie] It's just a neck massager.

Oh no my friend.

No, this, this,

this is a ball crusher!

And I am going to crush Lola's tiny little man balls in it

so hard, she'll wish she was born a women!

[Jamie] Then what's Jill doing with it?

What's Jill doing with any of this stuff?

I mean, a corset 10 sizes too big.

Yeah, that's pretty weird.

Come on, you know you want to.

What?

Put it on.

Come on, I won't tell.

I'm not fucking putting that on.

Your titties will look friggin' huge.

Don't talk to me that way!

If you're not secure enough in your masculinity,

that's fine.

But I think you should.

I got nothin' to prove.

Fine.

Whatever, you're boring.

You're boring.

Well, this should be plenty.

Wish me luck, I'm gonna need it.

[Jamie] Good luck.

And hey, good luck to you too.

[Jamie] For what?

You know.

You've got some interesting nights ahead of you.

(whimsical music)

Oh my god,

my titties look friggin' huge.


Oh, hey!

You ready?

I'm just going to change and--

I think you should wear that.

This?

I'm just, I'm just fuckin' around.

[Jill] I bought it for you.

What?

No you didn't.

Why would you think I'd want to wear this?

Uh, you are, aren't you?

Yeah but I mean, just to prove to myself

I've got nothing to prove.

And to see how big my boobs would look.

You don't think this is sexy, do you?

I think it's a little taboo for you to wear it,

and that's sexy.

[Jamie] Yeah?

And your discomfort's sexy too.

Yeah?

Oh, you're right, I mean, this is really uncomfortable.

(upbeat electronic music)

Okay, so this is really uncomfortable.

Hey look, it's that hot girl we used to know.

She has a name Jamie, and it's Melina.

Let's go talk to her.

Hey Melina!

Hey Jamie!

Oh, I go by Sally here.

S&M Sally, I love it!

Ooh, and I love that corset.

Oh it's, thank you.

It's so daring and unexpected for you.

It's hot.

Here I go by Firecracker.

Firecracker, that's hot!

[Melina] Literally.

Literally.


Hi!

Jill?

What are you doing here?

Are you guys a couple?

Yeah, we're a couple.

A couple of kinky perverts that love meeting new women

to play with.

So are you a Dom or a sub?

I switch.

[Jamie] What's your drug of choice?

Sharp things.

Ohh, that sounds very dangerous.

Oh it is, if you do it with me.

And tonight I brought needles.

Oh yeah?

Is that an invitation?

[Melina] Is that an RSVP?

Jill and I, we're going to do a scene tonight, so.

No, go ahead.

We're branching out, so go for it.

Are you sure?

Yeah, I think Mistress Chyenne is getting out the vac bed,

and I want to try it.

Oh, what's that?

It's like shrink wrap.

Oh cool, I'll meet you there next!

Okay cool, let's do it!

(slow jazzy music)

[Melina] Take off your corset.

I never thought I'd say this, but I'd like to leave it on.

[Melina] Oh, so you're modest.

[Jamie] No, just out of shape.

[Melina] You're lucky you're not mine,

or I'd make you do it.

You'd make me?

[Melina] Yeah, you know,

it'd be good for you.

Transcend your ego.

Oh, my ego?

Why do you think it's so awesome to crawl around

on the floor like a dog?

I, I don't know.

Because for a moment,

you get to know what it feels like to no longer care.

Besides, have you seen the other women here?

And you?

You're a total five.

[Jamie] Thank you?

Like a kid in a candy store.

Yeah.

Oh don't worry, the shiny will wear off soon enough.

I know.

Mmm, needle play.

It's such a rush.

People pay thousands of dollars for drugs

when all they really need is the fuckin' needle!

It was intense!

It's not like going to a doctor's office.

It was like really fuckin' cool.

Yeah?

I'm glad you liked it.

Jill, what are you doing?

Jill, what are you doing to me?

Jill, I don't,

I don't know if I'm ready for this.

[Jill] And what is this?

[Jamie] I don't know, you're not telling me.

Well you must have some idea

since you told me you're not ready.

I bet you'd let Melina do this.

No, I wouldn't.

And that's a really fucked up thing to say.

You can't be jealous about something

you gave me permission to do.

I thought we were trying new things.

No, you're trying new things.

You are.

[Jamie] Is that so bad?

No, it's not bad.

I'm just correcting you on the we.

I've done the club scene.

I don't need to go out every night.

I want to settle down with you.

[Jamie] You're subletting your place.

So?

So you can go back anytime you want.

And you know just as well as I do,

that once you give up your apartment and we stop going out,

it's over for us.

We just stay home and become like every other lesbian couple

I know that never has sex.

We don't have sex now anyway.

[Jamie] We had sex a few weeks ago.

A few weeks ago.

We haven't had sex since we started going to the clubs.

It's just, it's a lot to take in, Jill.

It's like one thing at a time, okay?

Like, how does sex even work now?

Are you the top?

Do you strap it on for me?

I just--

You're overthinking it.

And yeah, I want to top you in bed.

Is that such a bad thing?

Look, I want that too.

I do.

I just, I'm not there yet.

(slow jazzy music)

[Lola] Hello?

Oh, hi.

I told Jamie to lock the door.

Oh, Jamie doesn't lock doors.

And you don't knock on them.

Is she coming back?

We're supposed to go to yoga.

She's at yoga with David.

[Lola] They're at yoga?

But today's my day to do yoga with Jamie.

Yeah, I don't know.

[Lola] Why do I feel like everything I do,

he has to try to do better?

Yeah, I don't know.

He's just like Jamie.

They're always trying to one-up the other person,

like, see?

Whatever you do, I can do better.

Jamie's not like that.

When I told Jamie I wanted to have a threesome--

Yeah, I don't need to hear about that.

[Lola] She was scared out of her mind.

But then she goes out and rounds up five hot straight girls

to have some kind of orgy that God knows

she'd never have the balls to go through with.

What happened?

Nothing.

That's the point.

It's all bravado.

And I find bravado to be the most unattractive quality

in someone.

Yeah well Jamie's not like that.

We were together four years.

That's not that long.

I think I know her pretty well.

If you ever do decide to move in,

you should get rid of these mini-blinds.

So you know today's my day with Jamie, right?

You were with Jamie last Sunday.

This week's my week.

No, you have the first and third Sunday of the month,

I have the second and fourth,

and we alter the fifth Sunday, if there is one.

Who knows what Sunday it is?

We should do every other week.

Sebastian and I spend the first and third Sunday together,

if we alter every other week,

the fifth Sunday throws the whole schedule off!

See, this is why I'm gay.

Too much drama with women.

Rotating every fifth Sunday?

Only a woman would come up with that!

[Jill] Why don't you spend the fifth Sunday with me?

You guys are gonna need to go.

So this guy shows up to go golfing with his buddies.

And they say, "Bob, what happened?

"I thought you were going to stay home with your wife?"

And he says, "Yeah, she asked me to tie her up

"and do what I wanted.

"So I came golfing."


Get it?

Okay, okay, keep that elbow up.

[Jill] Hey Firecracker.

Hey.

Where's Sally?

She's busy.

I heard you like sharp things.

If you come near me with that, I'll scream.

Sharp edges.

You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

Oh yeah?

What do you think of this?

I think we haven't negotiated

this weird cafeteria fantasy.

And besides, I only go for butch tops.

Oh really, is that so?

You don't think I'm butch enough?

I happen to be the biggest fuckin' dyke in here.

Just because you have a spork, doesn't make you butch.

[Jill] Oh yeah?

What about this?

Closer.

Or this?

What time is it?

Uh, 11:35.

Sorry, gotta jet.

I have to get up early.

Next time.

You're getting better at this.

What the fuck are you doing with this thing?

I think we should have a threesome with Melina.

[Jamie] What?

Be hot, wouldn't it?

Is this a test?

Am I supposed to say no?

No, I think we should go all the way.

Confront out fears and come out the other side.

What fears?

[Jill] My fear of her boobs in your face

and your fear of me fucking you.

She has to be there for that?

[Jill] Not necessarily.

Well, do you think she'd want to?

Like, you think she'd totally be into that?

Sure, why not?

[Jamie] But you think she'd totally be into that?

Like, what do you think?

Let me ask her.

(smooth jazzy music)

[Sebastian] Good to see you!

You too.

Moving in?

I brought a few things for our night together.

Should we get started?

Sit down, relax.

Let me get you guys some drinks.

Oh ah, I thought I'd bring some wine.

Ooh, thank you, how thoughtful.

Red or white?

[Lola] I'm easy.

Yeah she is.

I'll have what she's having.

Actually, I'll have the opposite of what she's having,

thanks.

For such a seemingly smart guy, he's ridiculously naive,

isn't he?

If you're trying to distract me from my goal of having sex

with the hottest man in Los Angeles,

it's not gonna work.

That's exactly what I think.

He is the hottest guy in Los Angeles.

So what, you trademarked that expression?

No, I'm just saying we have something in common.

I see what you're trying to do.

It's not going to work.

[Lola] What?

I don't know.

But I know.

I'm starting to doubt how smart he is though.

Yeah, I see what you're trying to do.

And what difference does it make?

You don't like it, door's that way.

Oh I'm not leaving.

Well me neither.

So we have something else in common, look at that.

Do you have to do that now?

You're just jealous because you don't look good

in lipstick.

Yes, I do.

I wouldn't want to get your herpes.

[Sebastian] Here you go.

It's uh, hot in here, huh?

You're right, it is hot.

I'm just glad you're both getting comfortable.

Why don't you two kiss?

Maybe because I don't like to eat red slime

sloppy seconds.

[Sebastian] Huh?

You have a little.

If you're not ready for this, I understand.

Oh I'm ready.

I'm as hard as a rock.

Great.

I'm as slippery as a sea slug.

Yum.

Let's do this.

Yeah, let's do this.

Can't wait.

The anticipation is killing me.

Let's go!

It's so cool for you to invite me over, Jill.

Yeah, I thought that we would all benefit

from getting to know each other better.

Yeah, know each other a little better.

Know each other biblically!


You're so cute when you're nervous.

Oh I'm not nervous.

I'm just, you know, need some more drink.

You want more drink?

No thanks, I'm fine.

Jill, will you help me open some wine with your strength?

We don't have to do this.

No, I want to.

I just, maybe could using some coaching or tips or,

just more to drink would probably be good.

If you drink too much, you'll be sloppy in bed.

When have I ever been sloppy in bed?

If I've offended you and you want to cancel, that's okay.

No, I'll just, I'll meditate.

We should do this out there.

Women think meditating is sexy.

Who told you that?

Just seems sexy, I don't know.

Mmm, meditating is so damn sexy!

Yeah.

It's like having control and surrendering

at the same time.

Mmm, yeah!

It's like bliss and discomfort at the same time.

Ooh yeah!

Mmm, ooh yeah, yes!

Mmm yes!

Yes!

Ooh yes!

I don't think you're supposed to talk.

So, I brought some toys for our little evening.

Let's see.

Whip, crop,

oh, taser.


Uh, oh, a vaginal clamp

that I'm really looking forward to using.

Ginger.

To uh, cleanse the palate between courses, if you will.

It's for figging.

[David] Huh?

You peel it and insert it.

It feels amazing.

Oh, wow.

Cleanses your hidden palates.

Must be tried to be believed.

[Lola] I'm up for trying it.

Fine, you win!

You win!

Huh?

I'm not going to have a threesome with you,

are you f-ing crazy?

Honey, you're just overwhelmed.

Let's put the toys away and we'll just start

with the basics.

I'm sorry but I'm just not as cool as you guys,

apparently.

I can't get an erection with that woman in the room!

You don't need an erection to bottom.

I'm not a bottom.

Okay if we're all going to have sex,

we need to be honest with each other.

Well apparently I'm not ready

for this whole honesty sex stuff.

I'm an immature liar who is afraid

of finding mushrooms growing inside of a vagina!

(Sebastian and Lola laughing)

Some things in life are not worth knowing about!

I'm not kidding!

Look, it's okay, not all of us

are going to be in the same place on their spiritual path.

Your path might not intersect with our path,

there's nothing wrong or bad about that.

So does that mean I leave and you have sex without me?

Well if you decide to go and Lola stays

and has sex with me, yes.

Well, same path or different path, we're all on a path.

Growing, changing, evolving,

like a caterpillar into a butterfly.

Like an acorn into an oak tree.

So you're going to take this step with us?

Well I was just kidding about that stuff.

I mean, everyone knows vaginas don't grow things.

And even if they did, it wouldn't be,

it wouldn't really matter.

But I think we need to set some ground rules.

Do we have to touch each other?

[Sebastian] Not if you don't want to.

I don't want to.

I mean, I don't want to make it awkward for Lola.

How thoughtful of you.

But I'm cool.

I'm cool with this.

Good.

I'm glad you're cool.

(smooth jazzy music)

You ready?

I'm ready.

Are you ready?

So, what do we do now?

Well you know what really gets me warmed up

to just dive right in?

Huh?

When women lick my feet.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Alright.

Are you sure this is okay?

Yeah.

Mmm, now let me hear you moan.

(Jamie moaning)

You like that?

Mmm, yes, Sally.

Oh, hey, you don't need to call me Sally.

You know, the name's kind of a boner killer.

Get back down there!

And if she wants to kill your boner, that's her prerogative.

Yes ma'am!

Mmm, yeah, that's it Jamie.

Sally, come here and lick my feet.

Baby, come here, come lick Mama's feet.

Come here, baby, this Mama's feet need lickin'.

Baby, come here.

[Jill] Baby's not going anyway.

[Melina] She will if I tell her.

She won't if I tell her!

Hey, you know, this is going really well,

I guess and all but,

you think you could loosen up a little bit?

I think this one needs to learn a little bit more

about sharing.

I think this one needs to learn a lot more about sharing!

Babe--

You are not allowed to call her that.

If this domineering bitch doesn't work out for you,

you know where to find me.

That was harsh.

And I'm tired of you fucking me over!

I'm gonna go lock the door.

You've been a very bad girl.

Get in there!

Are you going to let her ruin our night,

or are you going to do what I say?

Yes ma'am!

[Sebastian] I'll be right back.

Hey.

Hey.

Did you sleep well?

Not really.

Yeah me neither, this bed is too small.

You think?

How are you?

I'm good.

That wasn't so bad, right?

You were over there and I just saw penis so yeah,

wasn't that bad.

I'm glad you put away the speculum.

Hmm?

The vag clamp.

Oh yeah, good times.

Good times.

I thought it would scare you off.

It almost worked.

[David] Really?

No, I'm pretty fuckin' tough.

Tough's kind of hot.

We could try it next time.

I'm fucking with you.

I'm just fucking with you!

(both laughing)

Don't tell Jamie, okay?

It'll be our secret.

I was supposed to back out of the threesome, wasn't I?

No, I wasn't being fair.

I mean yeah, I wanted you to back out

but for the wrong reasons.

I should have let you do it.

So we'll have to invite her back then.

Or someone else.

Yeah, just kidding.

I mean, I only went along with it because I like to think

I'm up for trying most things at least once.

I like the sound of that.

Do you really want to invite somebody else?

No, do you?

No.

Last night was the best sex that I ever had, you know.

Yeah, damn right it was!

And to think it only took us over a year to get this far.

Well, I like to think it was worth the wait.

Yeah, it was.

Do you want to pick out curtains tomorrow?

Or I could mow the lawn while you cook me breakfast?

No, don't get carried away.

I am still learning how to whip your ass, literally.

We'll see about that.

What the fuck are you doing with that?

Wouldn't you like to know.

[Jamie] Yeah, I would.

[Jill] Suck it up, bitch!
