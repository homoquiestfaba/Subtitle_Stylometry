Do you want to hear
a romantic story?

It was World War II.

He was young, 22, 23,

paratrooper,
tough son of a bitch.

They were being dropped
somewhere over France.

His chute was damaged
by enemy fire,

and he lost control

and landed on the roof of a house
in the middle of the country.

I guess he got injured somehow,

I think from the hard landing
from the hole in his chute.

Anyway, the man
that lived in the house

had a beautiful young daughter
who nursed him back to health.

And after a few days,
he left to rejoin his unit,

but not before telling her
that he would be back for her.

Eight months later,
he returned...

and he's been with
my grandmother ever since.

Beautiful story, huh?

Romantic, right?

Yeah, romantic.

He said that he would be here.

L... I told him this morning.

Well, why don't you give him
a call again?

I'll handle another patient,

and I'm sure he'll be here
when I come back.

Oh, my God!
You're unfucking believable.

I'm gonna come so fucking hard.

Oh, God!

Fuck!

Oh, my God, yeah!

Don't... Don't... Don't...

Don't swallow it.

Hmm?
Don't swallow it.

No, don't...
don't spit it out.

Spit it in here, baby.

You turn me on.

I gotta go.

Early this morning, local volunteers
gathered to work with police

in combing a huge area
down by the shipyards

for any signs of
10-year-old Ohristie Dillon.

But later in the day,

police once again
found themselves

reaching out to the public
for help in this unsettling case.

We believe the perpetrator snuck
into the bedroom window

and took her while
the family was asleep.

Detective,
one more question, please.

You've been questioning a neighbor
by the name of Roger Beckworth.

Is he a suspect?

No.

I already told you Mr. Beckworth
is merely a person of interest.

Now, that's all I have for you today.

All I ask is that if anybody
sees Ohristie Dillon

or knows anything
about her whereabouts,

to please contact 911
so we can get her back here

where she belongs,
at home with her family.

Thank you.

Detective, I just need to know...
is there any other suspect?

Frankie...

so you still want to keep two black-and-whites
in front of the house?

Yeah, and, uh...

keep the reporters
off the damn lawn, okay?

Right. Right.

All right, Barbara Walters,
that's enough.

Let's go. Off the lawn.

I got here as soon as I could.

I'm so sorry.

I got caught up with a new client.

I called your cell phone.

I know. The battery's dead.

I forgot to charge it.

Why are you crying?

You're 40 minutes late, Ryan!

I know. L... I got stuck with a client. L...

I told you I'm sorry,

but I'm here now,
a-and we're here now.

You did it already?

In the car.
In the parking lot.

In the parking lot?

Yeah.

You know I get nervous
in doctors' offices.

I just wanted to make sure
that I had a good sample.

Ah, Ryan, you made it.

Yes.

And I see you have your sample already.
I do.

Well, let's get started.

We're praying for you.

Thank you.

You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

Good.

Well, that's good.

Still getting your weekly tests, right?

Good, 'cause your parents
aren't backing down.

They want him,

and they're gonna say that you're
not fit to care for him.

They want him in a home.

He doesn't want to go there.

Well, we've done
everything that we can

to establish that you're
a responsible caregiver,

so who... uh, who's
assigned to us for this?

Michael Ambrose.

He's fair.

He's gonna listen to us,

and that's really all that you
can ask for in a mediator.

I know it sounds really cold.
Are you okay?

Yeah.

Why don't I come over to your place
the night before?

We'll prepare.

Okay.

I hate...

being obligated to talk to people

just because it's polite.

I hate...

people who say
that money doesn't matter,

because it does.

I hate laugh tracks.

I hate people who don't think
that there are two Americas.

I hate when you bite into an onion ring
and the onion comes out,

but then you're left with
this fried bread tube thing.

I hate how I always think that I have
a booger hanging out of my nose,

and I'm constantly trying
not to touch my nose so that...

I just... I always feel like
there's a booger that's there,

that's dangling there
when I'm talking to people, and...

I hate it.

I hate people who don't use pictures
of themselves on Facebook.

MIX

DID YOU LOSE THIS DOG?

Uh, sorry. I, um...

I think I hit something over here!

...Found her bed empty

and the screen
on her window removed.

Right now, neither of her parents

are considered suspects
by the authorities,

but there is some interest
being paid to a neighbor.

Thanks, Leslie.

Prepare for the heat wave to contin...

Ready to go, buddy?

One of us has gotta lose some weight.

And Paris Hilton.
I fucking hate that bitch.

And... And hairy moles
on people's faces.

You know, I just want
to grab that catfish whisker

and just rip it
right off of their chin.

Jesus Ohrist.

And rotator cuffs.

I hate them.

I tore mine three years ago,
and it still hurts.

And I hate...

I hate black people.

I hate the way that they talk in movies.

I mean, it's got to bug the shit
out of you, too, right?

Hey, what time do you guys
want to practice tonight?

I thought you guys were
DJing at Jones tonight.

Nah, it's tomorrow.

I got plans.

That old married guy tonight?

He's not that old.

But he is that married.

Man, from here, he just seems
like somebody's dad.

I got a feeling he's a little bit
more than just that.

Mr. Beckworth.
Hi.

I'm Detective Frankie Graylin.

I know. I've seen you on TV.

Great. So let's, uh, talk
about why you're here.

Right.

As you know, with your permission,

we searched your truck,

and we found a strand of hair
that belonged to Ohristie Dillon.

Right.

I know you already
gave an explanation,

but I'd like to hear it again.

Okay.

About, um...

three weeks ago,

I went to the park at the end of my street
to eat my lunch,

and I saw Ohristie there
with one of her friends.

I think her name was Heather.

And, anyway, Ohristie was, uh,
sort of helping, uh,

support, carry Heather,
who's limping.

Ohristie looked, uh,
a little overwhelmed,

'cause they had a couple
of bikes with 'em.

And where were you?
On a bench?

No, no, no. I was...
I was eating my lunch in my truck,

you know,
facing the softball field.

Okay.

So, you know,
I got out of my truck,

and, uh, you know,
I asked Ohristie

if she, you know,
needed some help.

And you know her?
Knew her?

Oh, sure, yeah.
No, I've known Ohristie and her family

since Ohristie was little.

You know, I've been over their house,

you know, to a holiday party
a couple times.

We do a big block party
on the Fourth of July.

It's a great neighborhood.

I get it.
Good. Right. Okay.

So, uh, it turns out that Ohristie's friend,

uh, her ankle was banged up
pretty bad

from falling off her bike, so, uh,

I loaded their bikes
in the back of my truck,

and I took the girls back
to Ohristie's house.

And had Ohristie ever been
in your truck before?

Uh, no.

No, that was the first
and, uh, the only time.

Oh. Is there a...

Are you currently in a relationship or...

No, I'm not.

Uh, you know, my wife and I,

you know, we got divorced,
like, 15 years ago,

and, uh, you know, I've had a couple
of relationships on and off since then,

but nothing too serious
the last year or so, so...

How about you?

A-Are you seeing anybody, Frankie?

No, I'm currently not in a relationship.

Well, uh...

This is probably really inappropriate,
but,

you know, after all this,
you know, blows over,

I mean, when you guys find Ohristie,

maybe you and I, we could...

we could have dinner or,
you know, we could...

Wow, that was inappropriate.

Yes, it was very inappropriate.

I'm sorry. It's... I'm sorry.

It's you're very attractive.

That was dumb. It was dumb.

Look, it's...
No, it was dumb.

Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
It's okay.

Okay.

It's all right.

Oh, God.

You know, actually I-I'm very flattered,

but let's just leave it alone.
Okay.

All right. Uh, I think
we're done here for today.

Uh, can l... Am I done?

Yes. I will send somebody in
with your release papers.

Sorry.
It's all right.

Oh, God.

Ah, fuck.

You know how fast you were going?

No. I'm sorry, officer.

I thought I was going
the speed limit.

No. You were going 39
in a 25-mile-per-hour zone.

License and registration, please?

Right.

Okay.

You startled me.

That was so quick.

Well, l... I didn't
mean to scare you.

Look, this is...

this is the end
of a school zone here,

you know, which means
that there are a lot of kids around,

playing, you know.

Sometimes they don't pay
much attention to traffic.

You know, they mightjustjump
right out from behind a parked car

to chase down an overthrown football
or something,

and, the speed you're going,
you're not...

you're not gonna have
time to... to brake.

You know, so...

So just, you know, for everyone's sake,
slow down next time, okay?

You're not gonna give me a ticket?

Thank you.
Thank you so much, officer.

I will totally be more careful
from now on.

Okay.

You have a good day.

Thank you. You, too.

Hey, Mrs. Harrison.

Oh, Jerry, honey,
I got something for you.

Um, how've you been?

Oh, I'm good. I'm good.

Here.

That's homemade brisket
with mashed potatoes and green beans.

You look like you don't eat,
so I made you a plate.

Oh, you didn't have to. It's...

Of course I did.

It's not every day you graduate
from the police academy.

Oh, I'd have brought it
a couple of weeks ago,

but I haven't been feeling well,
and I didn't want to take...

No, no, don't worry about that.

It's... lt's very, very sweet of you.
Thank you very much.

Hi, Mrs. Harrison.
Oh. Oarter.

Hey.

You know, you may want
to add a little salt to that,

because I use lemon juice
instead of salt.

Police are still refusing to refer
to Mr. Beckworth as a suspect,

but public pressure may
force them to do that soon.

In Hawthorne today,
an elderly man...

Dude, where you been?

Raid starts in three minutes.

Sorry.
Parent-teacher meeting.

God, and...

he ate the whole thing.

After he said it was...
Yes.

Oh, no.

Oh, my God, thank you.

Thank you.

I have not laughed like that in months.

Oh, how's Ryan?

Great.

And everything else?

Well, we're gonna do
in vitro this week.

That's great.
Yep.

And, uh, Ryan's been very supportive,

uh, but it's a...

it's a process.

Um, it's just we're both
very committed to it,

which makes it easier...

normal.

Hey, look who's on TV.

You think he's guilty?

I know he is.

I mean, she's like Tina's age.

I mean, this fucking job,

it's like a looking glass
into the soul of this world.

I mean, it's scary raising kids here.

We have to lie to them
about everything.

There's so many
bad things, bad people,

and sometimes I wonder
why we try so hard

when we're so clearly outnumbered.

Oh, you know, I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't mean to...

No.
It's...

No, it's fine.

Drink.

Yes.
Oheers.

Here's to pain.

Hey.

Hey.
Still out with Frankie?

Yeah. I'm just about
finished, though.

Great. Tell her hello for me.
Okay.

See you at home in an hour?

Hello?
Ryan, are you there?

Yeah. Yeah, uh...

I lost you for a second.
What'd you say?

I said I will meet you at home
in an hour. Okay?

Might be a little bit later.
I got to swing by Mom's.

Oh, um, okay.
Um, I'll see you after.

I'll see you in a bit.

I love you.

Me, too.

Okay, 10 miles.

How do you feel?

I feel...

I feel pretty good, actually.

Ah, Ohrist,
I'm sweating like a rapist.

And you, you haven't
even broken a sweat yet.

Here we go. There.

Now at least you look like
you've been running.

A-Are you Drew Oallahan?

Taylor Reese.
I was friends with Erik.

We played football
together in high school.

I was the one that threw him
all those touchdowns.

Remember that?

I think I met you, um,

our senior year after that game
against Drake.

You have to remember that one.
It was a real barnburner.

Right, yeah.
State championship.

Taylor, right.

Sorry, uh, kind of pathetic,

a 35-year-old guy reliving
his high school glory.

No, it's, uh...

Well, listen, it was
really good seeing you.

Uh, if you see your brother Erik,
let him...

Here. Give me...

Uh, hope everything's
going good for you.

Say hi to Erik for me.

So have you heard
from your dad lately?

Yeah, I talked to him
about a week ago.

Oh, you should talk
to him more often.

I spoke to him yesterday.

I think he might be coming home
for Ohristmas this year.

Has he said anything
to you about that?

Uh, no, he didn't...
he didn't say anything.

Hmm. Well, it really
will be a merry Ohristmas

if he can just get all that stuff
from that estate finalized

and get home.

Maybe by then, you and Kate'll
have a special gift on the way,

and then, you know,
it'll be a perfect Ohristmas.

Why are you listening
to Ohristmas music?

Oh, because it's beautiful...

happy, makes me happy.

It's June.

So?

Ohristmas is six months away, Mom.

Well, why should I wait
six months to be happy?

You are relentless in the way

That you ask me

So many questions

Of my days

In the calm city

Of my days

In the city

You are relentless in the way

That you ask...

Ask me

So many questions

Of my days...

How's your mom?

Other than the fact
my dad told her

he might be coming home
for Ohristmas, terrific.

Your dad's coming home
for Ohristmas?

Of course not, Kate.

It's been nine years.
He's never coming back.

I don't know why my mother
can't get that through her skull!

I win. I win.

I've got the most fucked-up
parents on the planet.

My mother's an idiot.

He lies to her, Ryan.

He's the one you
should be angry with.

He tells her that he's dealing
with his parents' estate.

He tells her that the French government
is screwing everything up.

He tells her that his...

his heart problem
prohibits him from flying.

For nine years!

Who believes that?

I know. I get it.

It's not exactly...

Normal.

Practical.

She believes what
she wants to believe,

what she needs to believe
in order to survive.

The results came back from Dr. Klein.

Your sperm passed the test.

Great.

At least my cum's
got its shit together.

Yeah.

So, um,

we can have sex tonight.

Um, then no sex for 48 hours,

but, uh, we can tonight if you want.

You don't have to.

I'm okay.

I'm fine, good to go.

I'm gonna go upstairs.

I'll be upstairs.

Hi.

Hey, how are you
doing this morning?

Good.

Uh, chocolate sugar twist,

three doughnut holes
and a black coffee.

Yeah.

Earlier this evening,
family, friends and supporters

gathered for a vigil
for the missing girl.

Anybody watching this?

...as far as Fresno came,
bringing flowers...

Good.

Just want to check
the Dodger highlights.

Two on and two outs.
And Johnson's first hit,

and laces it into the gap
in left center field.

Parilla scores, Revie scores,
and Hudson hasn't...

All right, so we've left
Maggie in the park, right?

And she's got her one-year-old,
and they're in the stroller,

and as they're walking
to the playground,

she sees this really
hot black couple.

African-American.

We have an African-American
president, Archie Bunker.

Okay, all right.

Well, I didn't vote for him.

So, uh, anyway, this super-hot
African-American couple

has got a ridiculously cute
African-American baby

also in a stroller,
and as the two groups

approach each other,
you know,

they're oohing and ahhing
over the babies

and saying the other one's
cuter and all this stuff,

and, uh, Maggie asks
how old her son is,

and she gets down
in front of the stroller

and says,
"Hi, little monkey!"

No, okay, come on.

Bear with... This really
happened to my wife.

M-My wife really did this.

Um, and so right after
Maggie says this,

she gets that hilarious look
on her face, you know,

and she immediately
turns to her son

and goes, "And here's
my little monkey." You know?

And she's so embarrassed

that she just calls everything...
man, woman, child, animal...

everything's a monkey.
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.

She just keeps saying
everything's a monkey,

and the other couple, I mean,

they're just kind of
backing away from her,

you know, not sure.

What do you think?

I didn't know your wife
was such a racist.

Shut up, Allan.

Wh-What do you think?

Allie?

It's great.

I think it's kind of funny.

Is it... ls it too offensive?

I don't think so.

Were you even listening?

Yeah. I just... I don't get
why you're asking me.

Oome on, Allie.
Are you serious?

I mean,
you're the only black...

uh, the only African-American
writer in the room.

Way to point out
the obvious, Bill.

I just don't get why you would think
that I would know if that's bad or not.

It's a misunderstanding.

It's funny.

Anybody who thinks that's racist

is probably some
uptight black asshole

who wishes somebody
would call him a monkey

so he could complain about it.

Finding reasons to complain
is just another form of laziness,

and honestly I don't have
the time or the tolerance for it.

You do know those lids
come off, right?

Thank you, class.

You did good.

See you tomorrow.

Mr. Aston.

Yeah, Tina?

Um, you know how you
were talking about that...

talking about
Martin Luther King last week

and how he, you know,
put himself in harm's way

so that others
could have a better life?

Sure do.

Well, my mom and I went online
and read some more about him.

Really?

Yeah, and, um,

it made me sad
what happened to him.

I was wondering,
do you think the world

would have been a better place
if he hadn't been killed?

I don't know,

but it sure became a better place
because he was alive.

Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

Well, thanks for
telling us about him.

Sure.

Bye.
Bye.

Do you love her?

Love? I'm starting
to think that I, uh...

I'm not so certain
what that word means.

You know, intellectually I do, but...

intimate love...

I seem to have emotionally
forgotten what that means.

She's like my mom.

They just insulate
themselves from reality.

It's like they're looking at life
through a windshield,

so thick that they could watch
a nuclear explosion.

I don't even have
a glass in mine...

and the wind's whipping me
and making my eyes teary,

and I can barely even
keep them open.

Great choices.
Thanks.

I love this dress.

Did you see the adorable
little shoes that go with it?

No.
Oh, my gosh.

How cute are these?

Very. I'll get those, too.

Okay, great.

Are these gifts?

Um...

uh, this one is.

Okay. Your daughter's gonna
look so cute in this dress.

Uh, hey, sorry.

Excuse me.

You don't happen to know
whose dog this is, do you?

No. Sorry.

Well, It's just that
I found it in the street

running around the other day.

It didn't have a collar or anything.

She's cute.

You should keep her.

Wait. It's a girl?

Yes.

You might want to make sure
she's fixed.

Right, make sure she's neutered.

Spayed. Boys get neutered.

Spayed, not neutered.

No.
No.

I'll let you know if I hear anything.

Okay, thanks.

Everyone's here.
We're good to go.

Gonzo, you're the main tank.

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Remember this guy heals,
so get ready.

Today marks the fourth day since
little Ohristie Dillon's disappearance.

Her father Paul held
a news conference

out in front of his house
to defend himself against accusations

that he somehow
may have been involved.

Gonz, you want it?

Uh, yeah.

Jim, use your fire magic, dude!

All right, I got it! I got it!

...dragging their feet
in this investigation.

On Oapitol Hill today...

Watch your flank!
Watch your flank!

It's on your six!
Shit.

Uh, I, uh...
Unbelievable!

You're thinking about the princess!

She was taken from her home.

We can'tjust leave her there.

Dude, you just wiped the raid!
Jesus, Gonz!

We need to focus up!

I have to leave,
help the princess.

What? You can't!

If you do that, you're out for good!
Where are you going?

Oome on, dude. He's an asshole.
Get rid of him.

Here we go! Oome on!

W-Where is he going?

How are we gonna heal
without him?

Oome on! That's insane!

We're finally gonna get this guy!

I can't believe this.

We're gonna have to start
this level all over!

I lost my job at the magazine
three months ago.

I don't know. The, um...

The pressure of work
and taking care of him...

itjust got to me.

Everyone thinks he's brain-dead...

except me.

And I know he's not

because of the way
he looks at me sometimes.

I know he's in there,

and that's why l...
we gotta do this race.

He always wanted to run
that fucking thing.

He's run every other major city
marathon in the country.

This was from his last race,

the San Francisco Marathon.

He placed in the top
30th percentile.

Somehow I don't think
we're gonna do that good this time.

We're gonna finish it.

We're gonna finish it.

Yeah. No, I understand
what you're saying.

Oh, Ohrist.

I thought that we had
gotten past that, Greg.

You're clinging to this theory
like a frigging flat-Earther.

It doesn't hold water.

You can't expect me
to believe that her parents

think that she would
intentionally hurt Erik.

Well, that is absolutely crazy talk.

Fine.

Bring it to the arbitrator.

Let him decide.

Yeah. Yeah.

She's sober.

Her tests come back
negative every week.

That means she's clean.

Oh, fine.

No, I don't have anything else.

Thank you for being
so fucking reasonable, Greg!

I hope that you
can sleep well tonight.

Orap.

You still haven't found the owner?

Oh, yeah.

I mean, no, not...
not yet.

Hey.

She's a, um... a weim...

How do you say it?

Weimaraner.

Weimaraner. Yeah.

Right, I can never remember that.

Hey.

Are you planning a trip somewhere?

Oh, no, I'm just...

l... I don't know.

Maybe sometime,
but not... not now.

She's really cute.

Have you named her?

I'm just calling her
Oarol right now.

Wha...

Yikes. Oarol?

It's... I don't know.
It's my sister's name.

I guess I don't really...

I just don't really know
that many girls' names.

What's your name?

E-Evan.

Hi.

I'm Allegra.

Now you know two girls' names.

You know, it's really nice

to have a guy on the beat
in the neighborhood.

Makes everyone feel safer,
you know.

Thanks, Tony.
I appreciate that.

Wait right here.

You don't tell anyone.

This is for you.

Oh, l... I, uh...

It's policy.
I-I'm not allowed.

Policy?

Yeah.

It's ridiculous. It's cannoli.

Um, l... I could buy it.

They're on special,
two for a dollar.

I get 4 bucks apiece for those.

Yeah, that's a... that's
a pretty good special.

Here.

All right.

You know we're in a drought.

Hey, Detective.

Are you doing the work
on this house alone?

Yeah, uh...
Yeah.

Yeah, it's a labor of love, you know.

Six months, it's... it's a big job.

So did you come here
to admire my house,

or you, uh... you gonna
take me up on my offer,

you know, picnic, a drink, dinner?

No. No, actually, uh,

I need your help about something.

See, I was thinking about
the statement you gave

inside the station yesterday, and...

and something doesn't seem right.

What's that?

Why were you eating lunch
at the softball field

the day you picked up
Ohristie and Heather?

I beg your pardon?

Well, I mean, you said
you eat lunch there every day,

but when I asked the neighbors
around the field

if they'd ever
seen your truck before,

they said no, never seen it.

Well, they're just plain wrong.

I go there every day.
L... I eat my sandwich.

I watch a T-ball game
or a softball game.

Oan you prove that,
Mr. Beckworth?

I don't go there
at the same time every day.

I don't eat my lunch
at any set hour.

It's funny. The mothers
that live around that field,

they're kind of nosy,

and they have a really great
Neighborhood Watch program.

Detective, I'm not
gonna argue with you.

I've got no reason to lie about
eating my sandwich at Memorial Park,

whether I show up there
at 3:00 or 12:00

or park my truck a foot away
from where it was the day before.

Please,

believe me.

Right.

Forget about the drought.

A garden like that's gonna
attract a lot of attention.

You gonna give me a ticket?

No. It's not my department.

I was just, you know...

You giving me a warning?

Well, thank you for the warning.

Don't start with me.

I've had a hell of a day.

We're gonna run
14 miles tomorrow,

and then I think we need
to start pulling back by Sunday, okay?

Oh, shit.

Ohh. I forgot
she was coming by.

Ooming!

Don't move.

Sorry about that.

I totally forgot about the time,
but come on back.

Oh. Um, if you're busy, I can...

No, it's fine. Oome in.

He's not shy.

Okay.

Sorry about that.

It always happens around
attractive women.

This is my brother.

Hello, Erik. I'm Kate.

Oan you hand me the,
um, pitcher behind you?

Thank you.

Thanks.
Sure.

Actually,

do you think
you could give me a hand?

Of course. Of course.

What, uh... What can I do?

I'm gonna lift him,
and if you could just rinse

the, uh, soap out of his hair.

Yes.

Okay.

There we go.

Okay? Just like this?
Yeah.

That's great.

Thanks.

I was gonna get
his hair cut for Sunday,

but I think it looks
pretty good longer.

Don't you?

Yeah, I like it long.

What do you think
of the moustache?

Um, let's see.

I like the moustache.

I hate it.

Will you hold up his arm?

Um, yeah.

Thanks.

So you've been sober
about six months now.

How exactly did that happen?

Did you wake up one morning
and decide that you'd hit rock bottom?

Um, I think it was more
like I hit the bottom,

and then the rock fell on me.

You don't think we're gonna
win this case, do you?

Isn't this hard for you?

Yeah. Yeah, it's hard.

It's really fucking hard,

hardest thing I've ever done.

You have kids?

No.

Me neither.

But I imagine it's a lot
like having a baby.

A really big, heavy baby
that you have to shave

and you get to curse around.

You didn't answer my question.

He can't go in one of those places.

He needs me.

And I need him.

What I've got

Is a man that's right for me

This man is a lucky man

He's kicking my ass

And lootin' my drawers for free

A nickel for my pickle

What I got

Is a man that's right for me

Sounds really good.

Good birthday so far?

Best birthday
now that you're here.

A couple of friends took me
to Katsuya for dinner,

and I made them promise
to get me back by 10:00.

You didn't have to do that.

Oould have done this
on another night.

No, I've been waiting
for this all day.

All right, wait a second.
Wait a second. Hold on.

Don't you want to talk a little bit
before your birthday fuck?

No.

Wait here.

Okay.
