My mother said: "In many years, baby!"
and my father ...

It was the happiest moment of my life.

Bring Thi remember what Meyer says.

Do not ...
It could take several months

until a court decides.

I saw this woman. He was there.
He had to disappear and how, suddenly.

Meyer will find another investigator.
And the clothes in my bag agatha.

I heard that I skipped a button
to be blind not to find it.

We re-evaluate all the evidence.

It's great!
Because we are not yet faliþi.

We can cope.
Minds all the time.

But you are very beautiful.

We must make a decision ...

What happens if they find
Women who left the parking lot?

Appeal was dismissed.

We can not present other evidence.
It was a holdup!

And if I use a credit card
we can say that.

Sorry.

It's crazy!

All Rights Reserved.
So we have no choice.

All you can do is call
Supreme Court, and you?

John, over the past 30 years, the Supreme Court
has not even solved a murder case.

No decent lawyer
not one to call.

Thus, A and all I have to do
ask a lawyer "indecent."

It would be very difficult to find.

I'll handle this.

But I want to do something for me and you.
What?

I want to analyze samples,
but remember that your wife Lara.

We have seen evidence, Meyer.

Thi not to judge the criminals
or innocent, but to analyze the samples.

An officer saw her
when he left the scene,

victim had blood on his clothes
and fingerprints on murder weapon ...

I took it out for dinner in town!

How could you do
after killing someone?

Must be a psychopath!
And the fight ...

Lara is not psycho!
Fight in the office?

Everyone is and fight with their heads!
But that ended with a crime.

There and then, you say you do not think
I never that innocent?

How can you say something like that?
What do you mean?

I want to say that no matter what we believe
Lara was a child to escape from the cavity!

You do not know how I hate to say it.

You will find someone else
for appeal.

John. John!
Be serious! John!

John!
For the love of God!

Come.
See for Scouting.

Let's hug eZi Peng
Micuþul Peng,

Kiki and Opossumy.
With lots and lots of love, Mom.

You do not want to write about us?

I have 25 cents?
To give you 25 cents?

Yes, but you allowed them to spend it all.

Where is the remote that me and mom
We pick you up when you were a baby and you.

Can I take them all?
Sure.

My wife, Lara Brennan

"Life and Adventures of Don Quixote."

What's this?

About the fact that faith in the virtue
But it is more important than virtue?

Yes, it says in the book.

But what is it?

It could be about
Ithier soul-destroying rational thought.

Or the triumph iraþionalitãþii
and the power that lies within her.

We lose a lot of time
try to organize the world.

Manufacturing by clocks, calendars,
weather forecasting.

What part of our lives
is really under our control?

What happens if we choose to run
facing the reality that surrounds us?

Prisons GUIDE

It would be a total madness.

What would be probably better
a life full of hopelessness.

BEYOND THE WALLS
Damon Pennington

This is a course they need people
than to be free, regardless of cost.

For another teacher
i was put on the spot "Butterfly".

Listen, you've missed
seven times in prison.

And what do you want to know?

How have you managed to escape when
does anyone else managed this?

I took courage and a little luck.

All prisons in the world
"Weaknesses".

Everyone has a key.
You only have one finds you.

How did you do?

I looked closely. Especially when things
who were not part of daily routine.

The guards are common Nuith
and doing these things every day.

And they make mistakes, what happens.
When you see this, you must be prepared.

You need to have everything well prepared plan
even before you decide to escape.

Escape is a breeze,
the hardest part is to remain free.

You need to know where to go
and how.

Need to know when they plan
to take, how and where.

How on earth can you find these things?
You pay someone who knows.

And if the prison is very important
is in the province or city.

He is in town.

How are you?
From Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is a city difficult,

with many bridges and tunnels
which can be easily blocked.

Once they received a call

Police may close the downtown
and to isolate it completely in 15 minutes.

How can I be so for exacþi?

In the wake of 9 / 11
Homeland Security has decided that each city

to have a safety plan:

downtown Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston,
Minneapolis to close in 15 minutes.

They can become "dead zones"
within 10 minutes.

And 35 minutes each border point
between states will be guarded by police

and all secondary roads will be closed.

If you do not take a picture with you,
Your description will be detailed.

And if I do not fit in 30 minutes?
Then, you teach.

Because the site will draw on
you and those who are with you.

Stay away from stations
and bus stations.

Look for local airports.
Escape to another state.

The second thing: identity.
It is easy to obtain false documents,

but it is difficult to obtain documents
you can pass control of the airport.

Need a passport book
management and social insurance.

If you rent a car
Find a place where you can pay in cash.

Will check the books of credit and thus,
for acts uses a real name.

The third thing: the destination.

You must go to a place
not attract American tourists.

Remember to Yemen
and I know what I mean.

Second, money.
You need a truck of money.

All hotels are expensive,
travel information.

For how much money do I need?

Both come to tell you how
at least five or six years.

If you're short of money, short of friends.

But before you do something, you must
ask if you are able to do so.

You can get to say goodbye to parents
because I never see more.

Can you kill a guard, you can thi
abandon your child in a gas station

or if you are slammed on the ground a little old lady
Nice that stands in your way Thi?

Because if you want to do
things, he and the future.

And if you're not in this state
does not start, because someone will be killed.

What is your sin?

I willingly surrendered.

I never thought I supported him to find
and waits on the threshold of the door of the bedroom.

So how much money you have in your pocket?

Good luck!

3 months

All prisons in the world have "weaknesses".

Everyone has a key.
You only have one finds you.

How did you do?

I looked closely. Especially when things
who were not part of daily routine.

In the left Allegheny County Jail's.
The world's biggest prison.

There were three attempts to escape
but they paid for it with life.

E. Right ..

this pillar to provide housing,

a sort of niche, on a stage wide and about
further, so as to adapt ... "
