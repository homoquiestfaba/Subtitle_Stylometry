MOMMY.

I'M TIRED OF CAMPING.

[MOM SIGHS]

MOMMY, I'M TIRED OF CAMPING.
COME ON!

WES.
CAN WE GO HOME?

MOM: WHAT, BABY?

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

WES: I WANT TO GO HOME
AND I'M HOT,

AND I'M TIRED OF CAMPING.

MOM: YOU... YOU USED TO LIKE
CAMPING WITH DADDY.

WHAT'S WRONG?

WES: I KNOW,
BUT WE DIDN'T CAMP THIS LONG.

OH. YOU'RE REALLY SAD, HUH?

WES: I'M HOT,
AND I WANT TO GO HOME.

MOM: COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

WHERE'S MY SMILE, HUH?

IT'S TOO HOT
FOR HUGGING, MAMA.

YEAH, FAIR POINT.

I MISS DADDY.
I WISH HE WAS HERE.

OH, I KNOW, BABY,
BUT DADDY'S HERE.

DADDY'S ALWAYS WITH US.

HE'S ALL AROUND US
BECAUSE HE'S AN ANGEL.

YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, HUH?

OK. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT ANGEL WISHES?

WES: ANGELS GRANT WISHES?

MOM: MM-HMM. THEY SURE DO,

AND YOU KNOW WHO'S
THE BEST ANGEL WISHER GRANTER?

WHO?
YOUR DADDY.

YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE A ANGEL WISH?

MM-HMM.
YEAH? OK. WATCH.

SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
WE TAKE DADDY'S RING,

AND THEN WE GIVE IT A KISS.

AND THEN I SAY, "SAM,"

OR YOU WOULD SAY, "DADDY,"

SO THEN I SAY, "SAM, I WISH...

"THAT WES WOULD GIVE ME

THE BIGGEST SMILE EVER."

HA HA! SEE? I TOLD YOU IT WORKS.

WES: LET'S SEE IF HE CAN
GRANT MY WISH.

MOM: OK.

DADDY, I WISH FOR A FAN.

MOM: YOU ARE
THE SILLIEST LITTLE GIRL.

WES: WELL, I AIN'T KIDDING.

MOM: I KNOW YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

I KNOW, BABY.

MMM. YOU'RE SO MUCH
LIKE YOUR DADDY.

YOU KNOW THAT?

SO MUCH LIKE YOUR DAD.

WHAT TIME IS IT?

WHERE'S MY PHONE?

DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY PHONE IS?
MM-HMM.

I'LL GO GET IT.

MOM: OK. PLEASE.

THANK YOU.

IT'S DEAD.

WES, WHY IS MY PHONE DEAD?

I PLAYED GAMES ON IT LAST NIGHT.

MOM: WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS!

WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.
GO GET READY, OK?

WES: CAN I PICK OUT OUR OUTFIT?

AND REMEMBER,

THIS IS OUR LITTLE SECRET,

NYLA, HURRY UP.
I GOT TO GO!

YOU GOT IT?

WHAT'S THAT LOOK FOR, NYLA?

NYLA: DUDE.

MOM: NO, NO.
EVERY TIME YOU SAY, "DUDE,"

IT'S SOME BULLSHIT.

WHAT IS IT, NYLA?

OK. LOOK. CHECK.
SO... SO I WENT IN THE HOUSE.

I WAS LIKE, "OH, OK. LOOK,

HAVE PUT IT SOMEWHERE

BECAUSE SHE CLEANED UP,
SO I ASKED HER.

I'M LIKE, "YO. YOU KNOW,
WHERE'S THE MONEY?"

SHE SAID, THAT, YOU KNOW,
SHE MOVED IT

TO THE PHONE BILL COMPANY,

AND SHE PAID THE PHONE BILL
WITH MY MONEY, DUDE.

NYLA.

BARBER: WHAT, YOU AIN'T PUTTING

TSS. YEAH, RIGHT.

NAW, MAN. UH, SHE GOT ME
THIS NEW JOB,

BUT I GOT TO CUT MY HAIR.

BARBER: OH. HA HA HA!

SEE? THAT'S WHERE YOU MESSED UP.

NEVER LET A WOMAN
GET YOU A JOB.

SHE'LL HOLD IT OVER YOUR HEAD
THE ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP.

YEAH. I'M STARTING TO SEE THAT.

I MEAN, UNLESS YOU GOT
A JOB OPENING.

BARBER: AW, MAN. NAW, MAN.

WE PACKED LIKE SARDINES

LAMAR: YEAH. YEAH. I SEE THAT.

I GOT YOU. SORRY.
WHOO! WAIT, WAIT.

BARBER: BRO, WHAT ARE YOU

BARBER: ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU
SAT DOWN IN THE CHAIR FOR?

LAMAR: YEAH, BUT DAMN.
IT'S... OOH!

OK. HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
OK. WHOA. ALL RIGHT.

HOW ABOUT WE JUST
START OFF SLOW?

WE START WITH THE FACIAL HAIR,
AND THEN WE WORK OUR WAY UP.

BARBER: HOW YOU GONNA TELL ME
HOW TO CUT YOUR HAIR, MAN?

I'M JUST...
THESE PLAITS WENT OUT

WITH "MENACE II SOCIETY" IN '92.

DANNY: HI. UM, THE SIGN
OUTSIDE SAID THAT YOU BUY GOLD.

BARBER: ARE YOU THE POLICE?

POLICE DON'T LOOK
LIKE THAT, MAN.

BARBER: ALL RIGHT. HEY.
MAKE YOUR MIND UP, MAN.

I'M CHOPPING THAT OFF
WHEN I GET BACK.

WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH
I COULD GET FOR THIS CHAIN.

CAN YOU HELP ME?

WHAT ABOUT THIS GOLD RING?

OH, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT FOR SALE.

HOW MUCH FOR THE CHAIN?

I CAN'T GIVE YOU MUCH
OF ANYTHING FOR THIS.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S GOLD.

BARBER: I DON'T KNOW
WHO LIED TO YOU,

BUT THIS AIN'T GOLD.
I SEEN PEOPLE MAKE

BETTER THINGS IN PRISON.

OH, OK. NO. THAT IS REAL GOLD,

ABSOLUTELY 100% REAL GOLD.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF HUSTLE YOU HAVE HERE,

BUT YOU COULD GIVE ME
SOMETHING FOR IT.

BARBER: I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE.

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON.

THAT I CAN GIVE YOU
SOME MONEY FOR.

NO. THIS IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

I'M GIVING IT TO MY DAUGHTER,

AND SHE KNOWS I'M
GIVING IT TO HER,

SO THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT
HAPPENING.

BARBER: LIKE I JUST SAID,
WHAT ABOUT THE THAT GOLD RING?

THAT'LL EASILY GO FOR $300
RIGHT NOW, BIG FACES.

300?

OHH.

UM...

THIS... WAS MY HUSBAND'S RING.

UM...

NO. ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T
GIVE ME ANYTHING FOR THIS,

LIKE, ANYTHING?

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

I'LL GIVE YOU 5.00.

GIVE ME $10.

BARBER: I CAN'T. I'M SORRY.

TELL YOU WHAT. YOU CAME IN HERE
LOOKING ALL GOOD

ON THEM SEXY-ASS SKATES.

I'LL GIVE YOU 7.00
AS LONG AS YOU SKATE OUT SLOW

JUST THE WAY YOU CAME IN.

JUST GIVE ME THE $7.00, PLEASE.

AND THAT'S ONLY
BECAUSE YOU'RE CUTE.

DANNY: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

I'LL BE HERE UNTIL 8:30
IF YOU WANT TO

COME BACK BY WITH THAT RING.

DANNY: UH, 8:30?

BARBER: BEFORE 8:30.

DANNY: UM, I'M NOT SELLING
THE RING,

BUT I MIGHT COME BACK
WITH SOME OTHER STUFF, OK?

I'LL BE HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

THANK YOU.

MAKE SURE YOU BRING THEM SKATES.

ALL RIGHT, MAN.

[CLIPPERS BUZZING]

DANNY, YOU HEARD ME
CALLING YOU, GIRL?

DANNY: OH, BROOKLYNN.

BROOKLYNN: YOUR LITTLE CRAZY ASS
STILL SKATING.

DANNY: OH, MY GOD.

BROOKLYNN: YOU BETTER GET IT.

HA HA HA!
HEH HEH.

IT'S BEEN... GIRL, DON'T
FALL ROLLING OVER HERE TO ME.

WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW YOU DOING?

I'M GOOD, YOU KNOW.
UM, I'M COOL.

BROOKLYNN: ALL RIGHT.

YOU KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET SOME WORK

AND DOING PEOPLE'S HAIR
ON THEIR PORCHES,

BUT I CAN'T... I'M TRYING
TO FIND SOMEONE TODAY.

EEK.
HOW YOUR MAMA DOING?

I MEAN, SHE'S COOL.
SHE MOVED.

SHE'S OUT OF STATE NOW,
SO IT'S JUST ME AND WES.

AW. HOW'S SHE?

WES IS GOOD.

SHE'S...
SHE'S GETTING REALLY BIG,

AND SHE'S IN SCHOOL...

WELL, NOT...
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ONLINE,

BUT SHE'S OVER AT CYNTHIA'S.

DO YOU REMEMBER CYNTHIA?
YEAH, YEAH.

YEAH, SO CYNTHIA'S BEEN COOL
IN HELPING ME WITH HER,

AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE FINE.

SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

FOR NOT MAKING IT
TO SAM'S MEMORIAL.

I JUST CAN'T DO STUFF LIKE THAT.

YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S HARD...

IT'S HARD TO GO
TO THOSE THINGS.

I DON'T... I DON'T BLAME YOU.

NOBODY LIKES MEMORIALS.

I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
SEEN YOU AT A MEMORIAL.

I COULDN'T TELL YOU
THE LAST TIME

I'VE BEEN TO ONE,

BUT JUST KNOW IT WASN'T
ANYTHING PERSONAL.

I WAS THERE WITH YOU IN SPIRIT.

YEAH.
WHAT YOU ABOUT TO DO?

I GOT TO WAIT FOR MY CLOTHES.

GIRL, LOOK. YOU AIN'T
WAITING FOR NOTHING.

THEM DRYERS AIN'T WORKING.
ALL THIS STUFF WET,

AND MY ARMS ABOUT TO FALL OFF.

COME WITH ME REAL QUICK.

ALL RIGHT,
BUT I GOT TO GET BACK.

IT'S OK. COME ON.
DON'T KEEP ME, BROOKLYNN.

I KNOW HOW YOU ARE.

BROOKLYNN: IT'S ALL RIGHT,
BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE FUN.

DANNY: I HOPE
MY DRYER'S WORKING.

BROOKLYNN: I SEEN YOU OUT HERE
ON YOUR LITTLE SKATES

AND YOUR BIKER PANTS.

DANNY: YOU KNOW, WESLEY
PICKED THIS OUT.

BROOKLYNN: I'M SURE SHE DID.

SHE TRYING TO FIND HER
A NEW DADDY.

HA HA HA!
GIRL, TAKE ONE OF THESE ARMS.

THIS SHIT HEAVY AS HELL.

OK.

GOD, THIS IS HEAVY.
I TOLD YOU.

BECAUSE THEY ALL WET.

DAMN DRYERS.

DANNY: WES... SHE REALLY
LOVES SCIENCE NOW AND MATH.

THAT'S HER THING.

BROOKLYNN: OH, THAT'S
SO AWESOME.

WE NEED SOME MORE YOUNG
FEMALE SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD.

DANNY: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
SHE WANTS TO BE.

BROOKLYNN: I LOVE IT.
GIRLS ROCK.

HOW ARE YOUR KIDS?

OH, CHILD, STILL
DRIVING ME CRAZY,

BUT, YOU KNOW, WE STILL
GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM, RIGHT?

DANNY: YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

BROOKLYNN: OH, GOODNESS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO

TAKE THEM SKATES OFF?

NO, BROOKLYNN.
I TOLD YOU I GOT TO GO.

BROOKLYNN: YOUR LITTLE
SKATING ASS.

AHH. WELL, BEFORE YOU
LEAVE, THOUGH,

I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

YOU DO?
YES, GIRL!

WHAT IS IT?

WE ARE LEAVING
PACOIMA GARDENS, GIRL.

NO FREAKING WAY.
YOU BEEN HERE FOREVER.

I KNOW.
SO THEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

CALABASAS!
CALABASAS?!

SO EXCITED!
OH, WE BIG TIME NOW, HUH?

YES, YES, YES.
SO, WHAT? HOW YOU DOING THAT?

YOU GOT A NEW JOB
OR SOMETHING?

BROOKLYNN: HA HA! NOPE!
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER.

A NEW MAN!
HIS NAME IS CHAD. HA HA HA!

YOU'RE DATING SOMEONE
NAMED CHAD?

OK. HIS NAME'S NOT
ACTUALLY CHAD.

IT'S MICHAEL,
BUT I CALL HIM CHAD

BECAUSE HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT.

IT SOUNDS RIGHT, RIGHT?

YOU ARE SO STUPID.
HA HA HA!

I CANNOT...
OH, MY GOODNESS!

SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND CHAD... MICHAEL BEEN DATING?

BROOKLYNN: IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE WEEKS.

YEAH.
SO WAIT.

YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HIM
FOR TWO WEEKS,

AND NOW YOU'RE MOVING IN
WITH THE KIDS?

GIRL, IT'S BECAUSE
I GOT THE GOOD-GOOD.

HA HA HA!
YOU ARE...

YOU ARE TOO MUCH FOR ME.

BUT ALL SILLINESS ASIDE,
I KNOW IT HASN'T BEEN

THAT LONG
SINCE SAM HAS BEEN GONE,

BUT I HAVE TO ASK.

YOU THINK ONE DAY
YOU MIGHT EVER THINK

ABOUT GETTING OUT HERE,
DATING AGAIN MAYBE?

NO. I JUST... NO.
I'M FINE, YOU KNOW?

I ONLY ASK BECAUSE... HEH...
CHAD GOT HIM

SOME RICH FRIENDS, BABY.

NO. I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

BROOKLYNN: I MEAN,
BUT REALLY, ARE YOU, DANNY?

YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU GOT ALL OF THIS.

YOU OUT HERE DOING HAIR
ON PORCHES?

YOU NEED TO HAVE YOU
A RICH MAN TAKING CARE OF YOU

AND PAYING YOUR BILLS.

FIRST OF ALL,
I LIKE DOING HAIR.

YOU KNOW THAT,
SO I'LL ALWAYS DO HAIR,

MONEY OR NOT,
BUT SECONDLY, I GOT MONEY.

YOU KNOW, LIKE, SAM,
HE LEFT US

THIS INSURANCE POLICY,

AND IT WAS
A BIG INSURANCE POLICY,

AND SO, LIKE, ME AND WES,
WE GONNA BE... PFFT.

I WOULDN'T TELL NOBODY,
BUT WE GONNA BE REAL GOOD,

SO, LIKE, I'M HAPPY, YOU KNOW?

REALLY?
UH-HUH.

I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!
OOH, GIRL.

DON'T MOVE.
BROOKLYNN.

DON'T GO NOWHERE.

HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

I WISH WE WERE SET UP.

BROOKLYNN!

BROOKLYNN: I'M COMING.
DON'T LEAVE.

OK. OOH!
I'M SO EXCITED YOU HERE.

IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE WE KICKED IT.

OK. THIS IS ALL YOU, BOO.
OH, NO, NO.

NO, NO, NO, NO. I CAN'T.

BROOKLYNN: WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME WE BEEN ABLE TO KICK IT?

I CAN'T, B. I GOT TO GO BACK
TO THE LAUNDROMAT.

I GOT TO DO POSTPALS.

I'M ON ROLLER SKATES.
I CAN'T BE DOING THAT.

BROOKLYNN: DANNY, YOU BEEN
SKATING HIGH FOR YEARS.

I AIN'T TRYING TO HEAR
THAT MESS.

LOOK AT YOU.
THAT'S WHY YOU GRINNING.

WE BOTH RICH, BITCH.

ONE PUFF.

I GOT ONE FOR ME, TOO.

COME ON. YAY!

ONE PUFF.
THAT'S IT.

JUST MAKE IT BIG.

â™ª MMM, MMM, MMM â™ª

OK. LET ME LIGHT IT FOR YOU.

UNH! GOT YOU!

YOU GONNA MISS ME
WHEN YOU GONE.

YOU GONNA BE LIKE, "DAMN.

"B ALL THE WAY

WITH THE GOOD WEED."

THAT'S OK. WE'LL SEND A UBER
TO COME GET YOU.

[VOICE DISTORTED]
TAKE A BIGGER PUFF

THAN THAT, DANNY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

[NORMAL VOICE]
WHOO! TODAY WAS SO GOOD!

I HAD MY GIRL, WE GOT HIGH!

WE BOTH RICH!

MAN, I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED
FOR NOTHING BETTER.

I'M NOT OK, B.

I'M NOT FINE, DUDE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I'M NOT OK.

GIRL, YOU ALL RIGHT.

YOU JUST HAD ONE LITTLE PUFF.

YOU GONNA COME DOWN IN A SECOND.

IT'S ALL GOOD.

NO, MAN. I'M NOT OK.
I'M NOT FINE.

I DON'T HAVE... I'M NOT
RICH, DUDE.

I DON'T HAVE THAT INSURANCE.
THERE'S NO INSURANCE.

I LIED.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I THOUGHT SAM TOOK CARE
OF EVERYTHING FOR YOU GUYS.

YOU WERE SET FOR LIFE.

SAM DIDN'T TAKE CARE
OF ANYTHING, B, LIKE NOTHING.

NOTHING. HE DIDN'T
EXPECT TO DIE,

SO HE DIDN'T DO SHIT.

SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WE LIVE IN A TENT
ON THE SIDE OF A ROAD.

WAIT. YOU...

YOU AND WES ARE WHAT?!

WE'RE LIVING IN A TENT, MAN.

WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LIVING IN A TENT?

OHH, MAN. I DON'T HAVE SHIT, B.

I DON'T HAVE SHIT.
LIKE, I DON'T HAVE...

I DON'T HAVE A CAR,
I DON'T HAVE FOOD,

I DON'T HAVE A HOME.

I DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND.

HE'S GONE. HE'S GONE, B.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DANNY?

I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

I JUST, LIKE...
I TRY EVERYTHING.

I'VE BEEN POSTPALING.
I'VE BEEN POSTPALING.

IT DOESN'T WORK WELL,
AND THEN I'VE BEEN

BRAIDING HAIR,
BUT ALL I NEED IS $200.

GIRL, YOU BETTER SELL THEM RINGS
IF ALL YOU NEED IS $200.

THESE?
YES, THOSE.

I CAN'T SELL THESE RINGS.

MAN, NO. THIS IS A HEIRLOOM.
A HEIRLOOM?

THIS IS, LIKE, SUPPOSED
TO GO TO WES.

GIRL, THOSE ARE TOMATOES.

NO. WES WOULD NOT
WANT YOU IN A TENT

ON THE SIDE OF A ROAD
WITH HIS BABY.

WES IS MY DAUGHTER,
AND SAM WOULDN'T WANT...

OH, MY GOD, GIRL, I'M HIGH.

LISTEN. I CAN'T LET YOU COME
AND STAY HERE BECAUSE WE GOT...

DUDE, IT'S ROOMMATES
AND HELLA KIDS.

I DON'T MOVE IN WITH CHAD
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

OR ELSE I WOULD JUST TELL YOU
TO COME OUT THERE WITH ME,

AND I SPENT ALL MY DAMN SPARE
MONEY ON THE WEED.

OHH!

I DON'T FEEL GOOD, DUDE.

OH, DANNY. THE WEED.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

I COMPLETELY FORGOT
ABOUT THE WEED.

YOU WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT MINDSET
FOR WHAT I PUT IN THE WEED.

DANNY: I DON'T FEEL GOOD, B.

I DON'T FEEL GOOD, MAN.

BROOKLYNN: LET ME GET YOU

WE GONNA GET YOU SOME WATER,

DANNY: WHAT DID YOU PUT IN IT?

BROOKLYNN: GIRL, LOOK.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ALL THAT.

I TOLD YOU...

BROOKLYNN: OH, MY GOD.

DANNY: I GOT TO GO.
BROOKLYNN: OH, GIRL.

DANNY: I GOT TO GO.
BROOKLYNN: BUT WAIT.

WE'RE GONNA GET YOU WATER.

DANNY: I GOT TO GET UP.
BROOKLYNN: THESE MY TOWELS?

DANNY: WHY ARE WE HERE?
BROOKLYNN: DID I NOT

FOLD UP THE TOWELS?

DANNY: HOW DID WE GET HERE?
BROOKLYNN: WHO TOLD US

TO GET ON THE SLIDE?

DANNY: THAT WAS PROBABLY
YOUR IDEA, BROOKLYNN.

BROOKLYNN: I THINK IT WAS.

DANNY: ALL YOUR IDEAS
END UP LIKE THIS, BROOKLYNN.

BROOKLYNN: I HAD ANOTHER IDEA,
THOUGH.

WHAT WAS IT?

DANNY: NO MORE IDEAS.
I GOT TO GO.

BROOKLYNN: WATER.
I NEED TO GET YOU WATER, DANNY.

DANNY: I GOT TO GO.
BROOKLYNN: WATER. OOH.

I'M TELLING EVERYBODY.

MM-HMM. ALL RIGHT.
WHOSE TURN IS IT?

IT'S MY TURN.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

OK.
TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE.

ALL RIGHT.

SAM WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

I REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU AND WES,

AND I REALLY LIKE THIS BEER.

YOU LYING, DUDE.

YOU HATE BEER, JACOB.

I KNOW YOU WENT AND BOUGHT THIS

SO GO AHEAD AND DRINK.

IT'S DELICIOUS, HUH?

CHUG, CHUG, CHUG.

YOU'RE LIVING ON THE SIDE

DRINK.

DANNY, WHAT THE HELL?

WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

I MEAN... I HAVEN'T TOLD
ANYBODY ANYTHING.

I DON'T... THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN ME.

I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW.

I MEAN, EXCEPT FOR BROOKLYNN,
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE

SHE GOT ME HIGH, SO...

BROOKLYNN? WHY WOULD YOU
TELL BROOKLYNN'S CRAZY ASS?

I RAN INTO HER.

DANNY, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

WELL, I NEED $200.

LIKE, I'M GOOD FOR IT.

I HAVE CLIENTS LINED UP
ALL NEXT WEEK.

IT'S JUST THAT...

I GOT SHORTED TODAY,

AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE ME
GOING AROUND

DOING POSTPALS AND EVERYTHING

BECAUSE I JUST NEED TO
GET THIS APARTMENT.

I'M SO CLOSE.

WELL, I JUST PAID MY BILLS,
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU 75, 80,

AND... AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT
THE REST IN A FEW DAYS.

I APPRECIATE THAT.

I DO, BUT, UM... IT'S JUST NOT
GONNA WORK

BECAUSE I HAVE TO GIVE HIM
THE MONEY TODAY.

HE'S ONLY HOLDING IT...

FOR ONE MORE DAY.

HE'S BEEN HOLDING IT
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

SO I JUST... I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

WELL... WHAT IF YOU AND WES
JUST COME STAY WITH ME?

YOU CAN... BE OFF THE STREET,

AND YOU CAN SAVE
FOR AN APARTMENT,

AND YOU DON'T GOT TO RUSH
AND JUST TAKE ANYTHING.

YOU SERIOUS?

JUST STAY IN MY GRANDMA'S

YOU'RE NOT KIDDING?
NO.

I WANT YOU... I WANT TO LOOK OUT
FOR YOU AND WES,

SO YOU CAN STAY HERE.

DANNY: OH, MY GOD.
I MEAN... YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO TELL WES.

YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
TELLING HER WE'VE BEEN CAMPING,

SO SHE THINKS
WE'VE BEEN CAMPING,

AND SHE JUST KEEPS SAYING
HOW MUCH SHE WANTS TO GO HOME,

AND I, LIKE...
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

DANNY, COME ON.
I WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU TWO.

MAN.
I'M HERE FOR YOU,

BOTH OF YOUSE.

YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

THANK YOU.
ALL THESE YEARS, AND...

I KNOW... HEH... HELL,

OH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
THAT, THOUGH.

IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
DANNY.

DANNY, I WANT YOU.

JACOB, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

I TOLD YOU BEFORE
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

IT'S OK. STOP, OK?

YOU GOT IT? WHAT ARE THESE?

APPARENTLY MY NEW WASHERS.

THESE ARE YOUR NEW WASHERS?

GIRL, HELL, NO, THEY AIN'T NEW.

NO. GHETTO-ASS LANDLORD.

THIS WHY I'M LEAVING.

I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING RIGHT NOW.

YOU WENT AND GOT YOUR HAIR DONE?

HOW... YOU WENT AND GOT
IT BRAIDED?

YOU KNOW I COULD HAVE
BRAIDED IT.

I SAT THERE
AND TOLD YOU EVERYTHING,

AND YOU LEFT AND GOT IT BRAIDED,
AND YOU...

I HADN'T SEEN YOU IN AGES.

I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY,

AND IN MY DEFENSE,
I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY.

CHAD PAID FOR IT
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE DON'T WANT

HIS WOMAN OUT IN CALABASAS
LOOKING CRAZY.

THESE EDGES ARE TOO TIGHT.

YOU'RE GONNA BE LOSING
YOUR HAIR.

CHAD... HE GONNA PAY
FOR YOUR REGROW, TOO?

THE SHADE OF IT ALL.
HA HA HA!

WHERE'S THE RING.
WHERE IS IT?

BAM!
EEH!

OH, MY GOD!
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BROOKLYNN.

I TOTALLY THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA...

NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN.

YEAH, GIRL. IT WAS CRAZY.
IT WAS STUCK, LIKE,

IN THE...
IN BETWEEN THE WICKER

IN THE LAUNDRY BASKET.

DUDE, YEAH. GOD.

YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO ME, MAN.

I JUST THOUGHT... TODAY'S
JUST BEEN...

WE'LL HAVE TO TALK OVER DRINKS,

BUT I GOT TO GO GET WES,
AND I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

YOU ABOUT TO GO SELL THAT RING?

NO. LIKE, BROOKLYNN,
I TOLD YOU

HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME.

THIS IS SAM'S RING.

I GOT SOME OTHER THINGS
BACK WHERE I'M STAYING

THAT I COULD PAWN,
AND I'M CERTAIN

I CAN GET, LIKE, 200
OR SOMETHING OFF OF IT

IF I... LISTEN. I GOT THIS.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I DON'T NEED THAT FACE.

BROOKLYNN: WE FOUND THAT RING
IN THAT BASKET FOR A REASON.

THAT WAS A SIGN FROM SAM.

OK. LISTEN, PASTOR BROOKLYNN.

I GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS.
IT'S MONDAY,

SO I'M GONNA GET THIS DONE.

BROOKLYNN!

BROOKLYNN, BROOKLYNN.

OH, SHIT, GIRL.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

DO YOU HAVE A WASHCLOTH
OR SOMETHING?

YOU GOT INTO IT
WITH A ICE SKATER, DIDN'T YOU?

THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE.

BECAUSE I THOUGHT ICE SKATERS
AND ROLLER SKATERS

HAVE BEEF OR SOMETHING.

CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A WASHCLOTH?

YELLING AT ME BECAUSE YOU DONE
SKITCHED OUT ON YOUR SKATES?

I DIDN'T SKITCH OUT.

HERE. I GOT A WET ONE
OR A DRY ONE.

THANK YOU.
BUT SERIOUSLY,

WHAT HAPPENED?

DANNY: DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MAN.

UGH. MY FEET HURT SO BADLY.

BROOKLYNN: I GUESS SO.
YOU BEEN SKATING AROUND PACOIMA.

OK. SO SERIOUSLY, DID YOU WIN
THE ROLLER DERBY BATTLE?

I'LL TELL YOU SOME OTHER TIME,
BROOKLYNN.

COULD I LEAVE THIS STUFF HERE?

EVER SINCE YOU BEEN HERE,
YOU BEEN ASKING ME TO DO SHIT.

COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME?
I CAN COME GET IT LATER.

I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
MY NEXT MOVE.

IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
LATER, GIRL.

I GOT PLANS. CHAD'S ON HIS WAY
TO COME GET ME.

ALL RIGHT. WELL, IS THERE
ANYTHING IN MY HAIR?

YOU GOT GRASS IN YOUR HAIR
AND STUFF?

WHAT IS... WHAT?

IS THAT GRASS AND TWIGS?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

ALL RIGHT. IS IT OUT?

BROOKLYNN: WHO DO I NEED
TO CALL?

OK. IS IT OUT?
YES.

DO I LOOK OK?

I MEAN, I GUESS.

LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

YOU COMING BACK LOOKING
ALL BEAT UP AND TATTERED.

ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK
A LITTLE BIT LATER.

I LOOK ALL RIGHT, RIGHT?
YEAH.

ALL RIGHT. OK.
ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT. BYE. THANK YOU.
I'LL BE BACK.

BROOKLYNN: I'MMA PRAY FOR YOU.

DANNY: THANK YOU.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

MAN: HEY, BEAUTIFUL.
HOW YOU DOING? YOU ALL RIGHT?

YOU A PREACHER?
THIS YOUR CHURCH?

I AIN'T NEVER SEEN A REVEREND
IN SKATES.

AUTOMATED VOICE: INCOMING CALL
FROM SUGAR LIPS.

SO MY CAR'S GOING OFF
BECAUSE THAT'S... HOLD ON.

AUTOMATED VOICE: CALL DECLINED.

MAN: IT'S MESSED UP.
I APOLOGIZE.

IT KEPT BEEPING.

WHAT YOU DOING OUT HERE
IN SKATES?

THEM SKATES? THEM SKATES.

WHAT YOU DOING OUT HERE
SKATING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
WALKING AROUND HERE,

LET ALONE SKATING, HUH?

YOU MUST GOT SOMEBODY.

BECAUSE IF YOU WAS ON YOUR OWN,
YOU WOULD AT LEAST HAVE A CAR.

ASS LIKE THAT,
YOU'D HAVE A CAR, BOAT,

HELICOPTER, SOMETHING.

YOU DON'T NEED A CAR?

I MEAN, ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS TALK TO ME.

IT'S COMMUNICATION, YOU KNOW?

QUIET TYPE, HUH?

THAT MEANS SMART.
THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER SAYS.

SHE SAYS MOST WOMEN
THAT'S REAL QUIET,

IT MEAN THAT THEY REALLY SMART
BECAUSE THEY LISTEN.

THEY ABSORB STUFF LIKE
A SPONGE, YOU KNOW,

AND THAT'S GOOD, YOU KNOW,

BUT YOU OUT HERE SKATING.

THAT'S... SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.

YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.

I GOT A NICE LITTLE PLACE
IN CALABASAS ALL BY MYSELF

WITH GOLDFISH.

CHAD?
REAL QUIET.

THEY DON'T TALK A LOT NEITHER.

HEH HEH!

I GOT A CAT, TOO, WITH 3 LEGS.

IT'S A RESCUE.

THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME
I NEEDED TO DO.

I NEEDED TO HAVE A RESCUE PET

IN ORDER TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

IT'S COOL. HE AIN'T FUN
BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO

WHAT OTHER CATS DO,
BUT HE ALL RIGHT.

COME ON. MAKE YOUR NEXT MOVE
YOUR BEST MOVE.

COME WITH ME.

I'LL GET YOU A CAR.

WELL, LOOK HERE.
GET YOU SOME NEW SKATES.

NO? YEAH.
YOU NEED THAT, RIGHT?

HUH? HOW THAT SOUND? NO?

BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

WELL, GOD BLESS YOU.

[REVS ENGINE]

[REVERSE SIGNAL BEEPING]

SKATES DON'T COST THAT MUCH.

THE LORD PROBABLY
GOT YOU ANYWAY.

[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

MOMMY!

HA HA HA! OH, MY GOD!

HEY, LITTLE ONE. YOU OK?
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

I'M GETTING HER.

AND A DOLLHOUSE?
CAN WE ALSO GET A FAN?

WE CAN MAKE

ONE MORE ANGEL WISH.

OK.

OK.

WAS IT A GOOD ONE?

YEAH.

BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT

ANGELS REALLY GRANT WISHES?

YOU'LL KNOW THAT ANGEL WISHES
WORK THROUGH DADDY

BECAUSE DADDY WILL SHOW YOU.

THAT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR ME.

DADDY'S EMBRACE,

SO THAT'S HOW I KNOW
ANGEL WISHES WORK

BECAUSE I KNOW...

MY WISH CAME TRUE.

SINGER: â™ª INVITED ME TO FLY â™ª

â™ª BUT THINK I LOST MY MARBLES â™ª

OK. YOU BE GOOD. I GOT TO

OK.
