You're gonna die in half an hour
if I don't take you to the hospital.

[SIGHS DEEPLY] Hmm.

Oh, god.

How do you know I'll be
dead in half an hour?

'Cause I was a so... um, nurse.

Where is your family?


[BOY #2] Hold on. Everybody squeeze in closer.


<i>- [MAN] Is that your perfume, Jessica?
Yeah. You like it?</i>

It's a little strong. Did you hose
yourself down with a whole bottle?

Leave her alone,
Hartley. All right.

I think you smell
very nice, Jessica.

Yeah. Fuck you, dad.

squeeze in again, tighter. Here we go.

Come on, Sebastian.
Take the picture. All right, all right.

Scoot it,
you little whippersnapper. Let me see.

Smile! Right.

Good!
There we go. Good. You did it.


<i>[MOTHER] I'm starving.</i>

[TAPPING ON GLASS]

I would like to propose a toast
to my beautiful stepdaughter,

the valedictorian of the Vernon
regional high school, class of 1983.

In her, I see...

All the ideal qualities
of womanhood.

Here's to you,
and to the wonderful surprises...

That we know you have
in store for us.

Cheers, kiddo.
Up your bottom. Well done!


Well listen, don't worry, Stanford
will shrink that swollen head in a second.

I'm not worried.
Dad.

<i>Mom said that when
you were in graduate school at Oxford,</i>

<i>you took some acid
and thought you were a dog,</i>

<i>and she had to walk you
on a leash buck naked on all fours.</i>

Really? <i>Yeah, she said you...</i>

You crapped in the gutter like a dog,
and raised your leg, and...

<i>And it was
in all the papers. She told you that?</i>


[WHISPERING, LAUGHING]

Someday I'll tell you the truth.

Uh-huh, that's just
how I remember it.

That's the version I heard.

So, Troy. What are your plans?

What do you mean, sir?
Exactly.

<i>[LAUGHING]
That's quite amusing, sir.</i>

Don't call him "sir,"
you suck-up.

So, have you read
any good books lately?

He's reading books all the time, just
not the books he's supposed to read.

[SIGHS]
Dad? Can you excuse me for a second?

Sure.

Hey. Hey, Hank.

Everything okay?

No, I'm good.

I'm worried about you.

Why? Because your final report
card came in the mail today.

Nothin' to say about that, huh?

Well, you know
what this means, don't you?

No.
No television, no allowance, no dates.

You're grounded until you make up all the classes
and assignments that you missed.

Fine.
And you go to summer school.

<i>You flunk that, you're
gonna go to military school in September.</i>

Fine. <i>And you get a job.</i>

I don't care if you have to shovel
shit till your back snaps.

I want to see a paycheck every goddamn Friday.
A job?

<i>A job, yeah. Fine.</i>

Capisci <i>? I said all right.</i>

<i>Look, I'm trying
to help you, kid.</i>

I understand.
It's for your own good.

Your mother spoils you rotten,
and your father ain't around.

I understand, sir. <i>Good.</i>

<i>I'm finished. Good.</i>

<i>Someday you'll be
on your own, and...</i>

I don't know,
maybe you'll appreciate all my bullshit.

Thought you said
you were finished.

All right.

I love you, kid.
I love you, too.

Come back inside.
I'll be there in a minute.

All right. [SIGHS DEEPLY]

Hi. Who are you?

Sebastian.

Sorry. I thought you were someone else.

You taste like strawberry.

Lip gloss.

I gotta go.

[â™ª ROCK ON STEREO]

So who's gonna
wake you up for school?

You're never gonna get there
before lunch without me.

If you didn't
wake me up, I wake up myself.

I just don't,
'cause I know you will. Please.

You'll never get up!

I'd love to get out of here.

I could come live
with you in California. I don't think so.

I'll see you at Thanksgiving.

I won't bug you.
You're bugging me now.

Would you get your feet
off my bed, please?

When Troy gets here,
you get out.

Gonna have a big
farewell scene? No.

We're gonna have a very serious talk.
You're gonna cut him loose.

Would you just mind
your own business, please? [DOOR OPENS]

downstairs for a minute?

What?

Please sit down, darling.
[EMBARRASSED CHUCKLING]

What?

<i>Now, you tell them, Hank.</i>

Um...

Um, there's something that
I want to say to you kids.

Um...

It-it's kind of hard... To say.

<i>I love you both very much.</i>

<i>I love your mother very much.</i>

<i>You're the most
important thing in the whole world to me.</i>

Um...

But...

This is a thing that
I've been thinking about for a long time,

maybe... maybe my whole life.

And it's something that
I have to do now.

<i>Um, but I don't want it
to change anything for us as a family.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>I've decided to, um...</i>

Uh, to start a process to, um...

I've decided to become a woman.

Mom? Uh, yes, baby?

What the fuck
is this insane bullshit?


<i>You are so</i> pathetic!

Hmm. [HANK] Jessica.

<i>- Fuck you!

You freaky fuck,

Jesus, Hank.

Going to the arcade.

Mom's throwing plates

I'm takin' off.

<i>To California?

<i>You guys are gonna bust your asses!</i>

What about all your stuff?

Fuck it. Send it to me.

You're leaving right now?

Yeah. Come here.

[CRANKS, REVS ENGINE]

What is it?
Wake up. I want to show you something.

What? Here. Put your robe on.

It's a big surprise!

Get your shoes.
Hurry up now, come on! Okay.

[CONTINUES WHISPERING]
Come on! Be quiet. Come on.

[OWL HOOTING]

Where are
we goin', mom? You'll see.


I was just always crazy about this place.

I wanted you to see it
before we left. Where are we going?

Back to england.

How long for?

Hank too?

No!

I'm gonna hate it there.
Oh, no.

It's fantastic.

We're going to have lots of fun.

I doubt it.

Hungry?

Want some strawberry pancakes?

Sure. Sure.

So he's gonna
chop off his dick? Yeah.

First you take female hormones and grow
tits and an ass and lose body hair,

and then you chop it off.


Well, he still wants to be with my mom,
so I guess that makes him a dyke.

Yo, man... he's fucked up.

Fuck yeah, man. Now I know why
your mother's running for her life.

I'm... fuck. Fuck that shit, man.

<i>[HANK] Sebastian!

<i>Come on down. I want to say good-bye.

You come up.
He's fuckin' tweaked.

I'm outta here.

So, uh...
I have to wear a suit to school every day.

That's not
so bad, huh? Maybe for you.

So, you're gonna be
gone forever.

Never gonna come back
to this shithole? Yup.

All right, man.

Well, fellas... <i>[LADDER RATTLING]</i>

I guess
I'll see you. Oh, don't make me cry.

Jimmy. Have a nice life.

See ya later, pal.

Don't you let that guy
touch you, man.

Hey, kiddo. Hey, Hank.

Sit down.


Never been up here.

How are you doing?
Fine. How are you?

I'm really bummed out
you guys are going away.

<i>Somehow I gotta believe that your mother
and I are gonna end up together.</i>

Listen, if you want to talk,

you can call me up
collect anytime.

If you ever need
a place to stay, you've got one.

Okay?

Thanks.

I'm gonna go down now. Give me a hug.

I know you had a rough start.

But I have a feeling that everything

It's really going to change.
<i>You're gonna be all right.</i>

Mmm! I'm gonna be fine.

Your sister's 10,000 miles away.

[â™ª ROCK ON JUKEBOX]

Hi. Hi!

How are you doing tonight?
Fine, how are you doing tonight?

Thanks.

Okay.
So, listen. The conditions are simple.

<i>Conditions?

All right. Lay 'em on me.

You start school on Monday...
But I need a vacation!

You start school on Monday,
and you keep the place clean or else.

Or else what?
Or else you find another place to live.

You're bluffing.
Do I look like I'm bluffing?

So, how's the job?
It's the same.

Sickos, drunk drivers, hookers...

Sometimes I actually defend
somebody who really needs my help.

I'm a dope.

Thank you, sweetheart.
You're welcome.

[ICE CUBES SPILLING]
Ohh! Oh, I'm sorry.

No, that's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

No, that's okay.
Just a little coke. I got it.

I got it, thank you.
It's all right. It was his fault.

[LAUGHING]
That was really smooth.

I think she's into it.
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

Yeah, she's so into it, we'll probably

Oh, eight or nine months.

<i>Ah, well, well. You shouldn't have

I have a copy right here.

Great.


<i>[PAPERS RUSTLING] Yeah.</i>

Uh, will you be returning

<i>Have you filled out

I heard Hank's a drag queen.
[IMITATES FELLATIO] Uh-huh.

You got money for gas?

Got a dollar.
Well, give it to me.

Take it.

Yeah, well, your sister

Yeah, well she is. Yeah, well watch
it, you little homoerotic faggot.

You "cork-sooker."

Spoken to her lately?

She called a couple weeks ago.
She mention me?

Actually, not once. Yeah, well,

there's a lot more

All right, man. End of the line.

You said you'd take me to 33.

Man, I can't drive your ass

Well then,

[MAN ON TAPE] Viruses, parasites

Collectively known as v.D.


Is the causative agent on the mucous
membranes of the male genitalis,

or "penis."
[DINGING, SLIDE PROJECTOR CLICKING]

<i>- [GIRL] Ee-yew.
[DINGING, CLICKING]</i>

Here we see salpingitis of the testicle.

Ulcerative blisters
form on the genitalis.

<i>- [DINGING, CLICKING]
[GIRL] Eew.</i>

They are due to a large gamut
of microbial agents...

That blossom in the human regions
of the anus, mouth, urethra, and vagina.

A cross-section of the uteri.

You like it? Is it for me?

Yeah. So you can get your ass to school
whether you miss the bus or not.

It's badass.
Thanks. Happy birthday, kiddo.

Thanks. What's this?

I don't know. It's a blue letter
from your Spanish teacher.

It's a warning. Yeah, it's my first class.
I miss it the most.

I think you would like Spanish.
I haven't ever had any use for it.

Yeah, well someday you will,
and then you'll be glad.

You'll be lost in
the middle of nowhere, and dying of thirst,

and this beautiful senorita
will come up to you, and she'll say,

<i>"Â¿que quieres beber, hombre?"</i>

And you'll say...
<i>un roble es un arbol.</i>

<i>Una Rosa es una flore.</i>

<i>Un gorrion es un pajaro.</i>

<i>"Muerte"</i> is inevitable.

That's very poetic. Look, I just want
you to live up to your potential.

You know, I've heard
this tripe about potential a million times.

But what if I am
fully realizing my potential?

How'd that be?

Well, what do you want to be?
You want to be a writer, right?

Yeah.
Have you ever written anything?

No. Being a writer means long hours
of tedious, frustrating work.

And to be good at it,
you have to be incapable of not doing it.

I don't like that.
I don't want to be like that.

I want to express those things.
I don't want to show the marks.

The marks of what? Struggling.

Besides, first I have to live a little,
so I have something to write about.

So, for the time being,
you're just gonna live a little.

No, I'm gonna live a lot,
and have adventures.

Like Hemingway.


Now watch your step going up the plank,
folks. It gets a little slippery.

Oh, by the way, Mr. Cole. Your little girl
Fiona here? She's a real go-getter.

She's been
breaking her back all month for you.

Listen, are you going
to be an architect like your old man?

'Cause you know I got my son,

he's coming to work
for me this summer.

You take over your
family business, it's terrific.

<i>Happy birthday. Thanks!</i>

Today's your birthday?
A week ago.

Oh.
I'm gonna get you a subscription.

Thanks, dad.

I was thinking
I'd take up skiing.

You need to do something physical.
Hey, dad.

Could I wear your watch?

[WATCH RATTLING] Anyway, if you're
serious about this writing,

you've got to be selfish.

<i>Huh? Gonna be
an important writer,</i>

<i>you have to sacrifice
the people you love to your work.</i>

All you can give back
is the work itself. You hear me?

All you can give back
is the work itself.

<i>It's like me.</i>

Not a very good person, I'm sure
you'll agree. Made a lot of mistakes,

but maybe that's why
I'm a good architect.

If you're gonna be serious about your writing,
you've got to cut people off a bit.

<i>Got too many friends. Way too many friends.
I don't have too many friends.</i>

You've got way too many friends.
You care about too many people.

You're soft!

If you're serious about writing,
you've got to play hardball. You know?

Or not, you know?
You could have a nice life,

and family, friends, right?

<i>Have a good time.
It's a valid choice.</i>

Expect a lot from you.

The guy at the taco stand
said that this was the hottest pepper...

Known to humanity. <i>[LAUGHING]</i>

Right.
Break it in half. Go ahead.

[GIGGLING] Not a good idea.

Oh, I'm beat.
<i>[ARROW STRIKES TARGET]</i>

Hey.

You want to give it a try, Mary?
Mm, I don't think so.

<i>Hey, you got anything

Is it okay? Yeah, it's good.

I was lying on the grass.

And this girl came
out of the dark up to me, and kissed me.

And when I kissed her back,
she ran away.

Why'd she run away?

She thought I was
someone else, I guess.

She wore that same
strawberry lip stuff that you wear.

It's a pretty popular lip gloss.

It was you, wasn't it? No.

Yeah, it was, admit it.
It was an accident.

Yeah, right.

Okay. I just felt like doin' it.

This is a nice house.

Yeah.

It was really nice the way

You got it? <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

You got it?
I said all right. So what's for dinner?

I don't know, I was thinking
maybe bacon and eggs. What do you think?

Sounds good.
Oh, could you hand me a box of those maxis?

Ah, Jesus Christ.
Get over it. Come on.

Hi, Sebastian.

Oh, hi, Susan.

How'd you do
on the test? On what?

The science midterm?
Ah, it was pretty stupid.

I thought it was really hard.

[CLEARS THROAT] Oh.

This is my stepmother,

Hi. I'm Susan. Nice to meet you.

We have science

How nice. Thank you.
That's a really nice dress.

You should call
Mary sometime. She was really upset.

Oh, brother.
Just call her.

All right.
All right.

Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
See you later, Susan.

Nice to meet you, Susan.

Oh, you know, these are the wrong ones.
Could you hand me the unscented ones?

Get 'em yourself. What?

Get your own damn maxis.
What's wrong?

You know, a real woman
would never do that.

What?
A real woman would never be so indiscreet with the pads.

Susan. Come here.

What?
I want to show you something.

All right, don't shake it.

Hold it upright.

Take off the top.

Put your lips to the nozzle,

push, breathe in

Okay? What's gonna happen?

What's up, dick?

Yes, well, uh,
I'm sorry about the hour,

but I have to take Kate

I'd like to get going before morning, so
if you could get your things together.

<i>Sit down a minute, dick.</i>

Oh, no thanks, Mr. chi-town.
We got a little business to discuss here.

See, I know it's real fresh and shit that you're
trying to come in here and be the hero.

I hear ya. You understand?
I know it's down.

But you gotta understand this bitch
over here, she owes me five grand.

I need that shit.

Well, I have, uh,

<i>[PAPER MONEY RUSTLING]</i>

It's a... a real chic,

No, sir.

<i>'Cause I know how to beat a bitch

I'll slice your shit up too, throw you

Yeah. Give me a smoke.
Here.

Have some for later.

What kind of watch
is this, dick?

It's a really chic,
nice watch from out west.

That shit's fake? <i>No, sir.</i>

That shit's fake,
I'll come out to Jersey and kill you, dude.

Ready?

Why don't you break out of here, and take
your filthy fuckin' rats with you too.

Yo, money. Lend me that jacket.

This is kind of nice.
Take it easy, pal.

[DOOR OPENS]

Wanna go for some tacos

Ooh.

Yo, I gave that guy

Yeah, whatever.

Yo, um,

So what?


Well, you wanna go, like...
You wanna go kick his ass?

I'll take care of that guy

All right? His number's up.

Well, that's what happens

Shut up.

Shut up.


I kind of like it right here.
Why don't we just drink right here?

Yo, I... [COUGHS]

Yo, I can't finish
my drink, man.

Give me that.

Holy shit, man!
Yo, take it easy. [EXHALES]

Aah!


I'm not even drunk.

[BREATHING APPARATUS HUMMING]

Welcome back.

I'm Jenny.
You're fine. What happened?

You're gonna go home today.
How did I get here?

I don't know. You were here
when I arrived this morning.

This whole room
smells like liquor.

It's coming out of your body.


Did you give me a sponge bath?

No.

So, kiddo,
what was that all about?

Hmm?
Why'd you try to kill yourself?

I wasn't trying to kill myself.

Well, what were you
trying to do? Have some fun.

I wanted to see
what would happen if you drank too much.

Oh, I see. It was an adventure.

Yep. Adventure number two.

What was number one?

You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

Well, if Mary hadn't found you,
that would've been the last one.

Mary? Yeah.

She found you bleeding
and unconscious in the street.

Mary? Yeah.

So tell me about your adventure.

I can't remember anything.

It's gonna make
a hell of a novel... 300 blank pages.

Shut up.

I heard you
pissed your pants, papa.

When did it start snowing?
Last night.

Come on.
Get out of the chair now.


Yeah. Car's right over here.

Too bad. If you'd have died,
you wouldn't have to go to Chicago.

Thank you, eunice.

Sebastian?
How was your time in england?

It was a really tough school.

I know.
I went to school there as a girl.

Well, the standards are
entirely different there.

Yeah, they specialize
very early now.

You're only supposed to take
three courses in the "a" level,

but I took four because I couldn't
decide which ones I wanted to take.

And not even the best students
even take... four.

I took five "a" levels,
and I passed them all.

That's unbelievable.
I was prepared, you see.

I was a very hard worker.

Did you like Stanford, Jessica?

Very much, grandpa.
What are you doing about college, boy?

Well, I was thinking I could go
to school where you and dad went,

or where Jessica's going. Yale?

I liked it there. I think your father
did, didn't you, Hartley?

Well, it's a very good school,
but I think it'd be tough for Sebastian...

To get in there or Stanford.

But you're a bright boy.
Sebastian is clever, but he's too much like his mother.

He's smart, but, uh,
I think he was just born bad.

Isn't that true, dear?
I don't know.

<i>And Sebastian
is very, very lazy. Isn't that true, dear?</i>

Yeah.
<i>[GRANDPA] What'd he say?</i>

<i>- Speak up, boy.
I'm no good, grandpa.</i>

Oh.

you've had enough to drink.

And... [CLEARS THROAT]
You've had enough to eat too.

<i>Hartley, when are you going
to pay back that loan?</i>

Mother, have you, uh, noticed
Sebastian's haircut? <i>Of course I noticed it.</i>

<i>I decided to ignore it.</i>

I just don't understand
how such a vain boy...

<i>Can spend so much time
doing everything he can...</i>

To make himself look
so unattractive.

The girls like it.
Oh.

I can just imagine
the kind of girls who'd like that.

Hey, kiddo. Hi, Henrietta.

How was easter? Fine.

Everybody in Chicago good? Yeah.

How's Jessica? Did you give her my love?
Yeah, she's good, okay.

Good. <i>[STARTS ENGINE]</i>

[â™ª MAN SINGING, INDISTINCT]

[â™ªâ™ª]

Party's over, punk.

[â™ªâ™ª]

Well, ma'am, be that as it may,

young Sebastian's record
since his return has not been impressive.

Even if these incidents
had not occurred,

his intention to graduate early
seems ill-advised.

This has been
a very difficult year for Sebastian.

Maybe the transition
back from england...

Hasn't gone as smoothly
as we'd hoped.

Um, what did you get
on the sats?

1520. 1520?

Wow. That's impressive.

Are you prepared to retake the test
under my personal supervision?

You supervised it the first time.
Dan, please.

My son doesn't cheat. I understand
Sebastian's father lives in New York City.

It must be hard for a woman
alone to raise a teenage boy.

<i>Well, yes, Leslie, it is.</i>

Perhaps as a woman,
I've been too lenient with him.

But I see now
that has to change. I agree.

I agree. Now, as I, um,
look at Sebastian's file,

I see that he hasn't completed his physical
education requirements for graduation.

What do you mean?
You haven't taken enough gym classes.

So you won't be able
to graduate this year, I'm afraid.

You mean I have to stay here
a whole 'nother year because of gym?

See, our educational credo
considers physical fitness...

To be an important part
of a well-rounded student.

It's what makes us unique here.

Well, what about all those... those karate
classes that I take on my free time?

What?

All the karate classes
I take on my free time?

Oh, that's right, with Dr. wu.

Yeah, with Dr. wu.
I'm a brown belt in karate. Brown belt?

Wow. That's impressive.

<i>You'll have to demonstrate
this karate proficiency...</i>

In front of a three-man
p.E. Review board.

Dan... it's procedure.

You mean three gym teachers?

And I'll have to accept
their final recommendation.

Fine.
And if you need a man to help you deal with this boy,

I'm-I'm at your disposal.

Thank you. You're very sweet.

Did you really get 1520?

Yep.
Give me a break. <i>Don't smoke in the car.</i>

<i>I don't know why you're in
such a hurry to graduate.</i>

Because I want to get
the fuck out of this shithole.

You were pretty hot
on this place when you weren't here.

I wouldn't have minded staying through school
if things were the way they used to be.

I still don't understand what was so
urgent for you to do this sex thing.

You didn't give a shit
if it blew our family apart.

Your mother decided to leave.

Oh, that's a unique viewpoint.

I thought that if you loved someone,
it didn't matter what sex they are.

I thought we had
something deeper.

If it doesn't matter
what sex they are,

then why does it matter so much
what sex you are?

Don't ask me what I'm thinking
if you don't wanna know.

I didn't.

All this shit that happened,
you caused it.

It's all about you
and what you want...

And what you need
and what you feel...

And blah, blah, blah.

I'm sorry.
Save it.

<i>You know, I took you in, I fed you.
I gave you an allowance.</i>

I go to school with you
to straighten things out...

So that you can do
what you want, and this is what I get?

You know what? Fuck you too, buddy.
Whatever, Hank.

Soon I'll be gone, then you can go back to obsessing
about your dick without any distractions.

You apologize,
or you get out of this car.

Get out!

Yo, man, guess what.

Ummm...

She failed me. Who?

Snarkies, man.

No, I am not going
to summer school.

My old man, he'll...
He'll tear me a new asshole or something.

What are you gonna do?

I'm gonna torch her house.
Oh, good idea.

Yo, man, I'm serious.
She fucked up my life.

I know where she lives.

Why don't you
just calm down, Wayne?

I can't, man. I can't, because...

Because I'm dead, man.
I'm-I'm done for.

Man, fuck that shit.

Oh!
When was the last time you washed these?

I don't know, man.
Like, three weeks ago.

Don't worry about it.
They're clean.

Well, I guess it adds
to the whole effect.

You want me to show you
some moves? No, I saw <i>enter the dragon.</i>

Why do you wanna
get out early anyway?

What are you gonna do

Well, get a haircut.
Pay taxes. Die.

I can get you a job

No, thanks.

I didn't wash the puke off until Henrietta
told me you were going to be okay.

Puke?
Yeah, you puked on me that night.

I did? Yeah.

And you pissed your pants while you
were sitting on my lap in Troy's car.

Oh.

It's okay, though.
I thought you were gonna die.

I'm sorry. I...

I don't know what happened.

Troy was pissed. Yeah, I'll bet.

But I told him to fuck off.
We broke up.

What was I doing in Troy's car?

You were lying in
the middle of the road in a pool of blood.

Thanks for saving my life.

You're welcome.

Henrietta did too.

She was really upset.

You look nice.
You too.

It turned out to be
a warm night, huh?


You still going away

Mm-hmm.

You still wear

Come and see.

It smells different.

Watermelon?

Taste it.

Do you want to come along?

No.

Do you want to stick around?

I can't.

Well, you know where

Um...

It's complicated.

In college, I knew a boy who liked
