We will never understand
his earthly struggles,

but have faith his soul
is in good hands.

So we remember
a business partner,

a brother, and a husband.

We say goodbye
to Jeffrey Scott Fredericks

and ask that he finds mercy
in the heavens.

Amen.

Thank you so much for coming.

Nobody wants to be around him,
even in death.

We want to support you, Claire.

Well, he's not suffering now.

He's watching over me.

No, he's not.

At this very second,
I can see him burning

in the pits of Hell
for all eternity.

Rosalie.

Thank you both for coming in.

I'm sure you have
some questions for me.

How bad is it, Dr. Warren?

Well, is this
a normal occurrence

that you get called
to Rosalie's schools

to discuss her behavior?

She's had such a tough time
adjusting to the new school.

I tried to pull her record...

Ugh! Ugh.

Ugh!

Ahhhh!

Wahhhh!

There it is, there it is,
there it is.

I said I tried to pull her
records from Shanesville.

Problem is, I couldn't even find
a city with that name.

Oh, uh, it's, um,
outside of Des Moines.

Uh, unincorporated, though,
so it... it never shows up.

She was home-schooled
while we were there, so...

Rosalie exhibits characteristics

of some in my field could call
an emotional disorder.

There are signs of psychopathy,
as well as evidence

of interacting with identities
that are not present.

Are you saying she's like
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde?

It's a misconception that
multiple personality disorder

is the same as schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia is when
the patient sees and hears

things that are not there.

And I'm sorry to say,
but I do believe

that this characterizes Rosalie.

Well, uh, thank you
for your time, Doctor.

I-I-It can't be easy
to do your job.

But I haven't even begun.

There are treatments
for this disorder

that I feel would best benefit
Rosalie's...

We're... We're moving again.

What? So soon?
With my job, I-I don't choose.

I get sent.
We are going to get help

for her as soon
as we get settled.

Thank you, Doctor.

Rosalie? How ya doin', honey?

You excited to move
to a new town?

No, silly. I'm Rosalie.

Oh!
Oops!

You don't want that.

Trust me.

Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

Trust me,
I'm the one doing you the favor.

It's lovely.

It is nice.

Won't be long now, Rosalie.

Isn't it cute?

It <i>is</i> cute.

Hey, hey!

Betty Goss.

Brand-new, right?

Welcome!
Welcome!

Thank you.
And who might you be? Hmm?

Oh, this is our daughter,
Rosalie.

Oh!

The move and all...
Oh, of course.

Hey, heads up... we take care
of our own around here.

You know that saying,
"It takes a village"?

Well, we put other
neighborhood watches to shame.

If it happens around here,
it's in "The Mirror."

Wh... That's our newspaper.

I didn't catch your names.

I'm Theresa Snyder.
This is my husband, Daniel.

Hi. Oh, Catholic, huh?

Now, St. Peters is the only
Catholic Church in town,

but Father Paul is the <i>best.</i>
Oh.

Why are you...
wearing your rosary?

It makes me feel closer to Him.

Oh!
Well, I'm not one to judge,

but there are those who say
that is just not done.

Yeah, uh, we better get
all our stuff in the house.

Well, I'm just down the street
if you ever need anything.

We're <i>very</i> tight-knit
around here.

We keep watch after our own.

Buh-bye!

Spiritual healing.

Maybe they got something
that could actually help her.

Maybe.

This is the kind of town
I could really settle down in.

Don't get attached.
I'm here for work.

Soon, I promise.

We'll be on
the other side of this.

Guys, look at the frog!

Gross! Get it!
Let's go!

Get it. Get it.
Come on! Get him!

It's so cute.

Ew, gross!

Ugh!

Ew, gross!
Disgusting!

Honey, go inside.
Mommy's gonna dry you off.

Did you make some new friends?

Go on.

Hey! Just wanted to welcome
you guys to town.

John Driscoll.

Oh, come on in.
Thank you.

Daniel Snyder.
This is my wife, Theresa.

Nice to meet you, John.

Ah. What brings you folks here
from Des Moines?

How'd you know we came
from Des Moines?

License plate.
Ah.

I used to live in Iowa.

Uh, job.

I'm gonna be working at
Dynata Tech, insurance division.

Oh, nice.
Not too far from the plant.

I'm foreman there.

Well, listen, I didn't come here

to take over the world
or anything.

Just came to introduce myself
and welcome you to the 'hood.

Hey, join me for a beer anytime.

Will do.

You're the one
saying "Don't become attached

because there's a job to do."

The faster you work,

the sooner we'll be able
to help her.

This is a process.

We have to make sure
the job is done <i>right.</i>

You know how to do the job!

There has to be another way!

I'll start tomorrow.
I promise.

Come on. Come on, baby.

Oh, hey, hi.

Harlan Lester.

Daniel Snyder.
Yeah, yeah.

Hey, listen, uh, my mother...

She's making her famous, uh,
chicken and trifle tonight.

She insists that you
and your family

just come on over,
and John will be there, too.

Uh...
Mother insists.

Sounds good.

Very good.

Speak of the devil. Okay.

Betty, what happened?

Mrs. Henderson
had a heart attack.

I mean, who didn't see that
coming, huh?

Oh, that's terrible.

Yeah, pretty bad.

Thank you.

Wait right there.

Break room's straight ahead,
and, of course,

don't hesitate to reach out
if you need any support.

Thank you, Mr. Woronicz.
I appreciate that.

Please. Gary.

Love your briefcase. Classy.

It'll make a great impression on
clients when you do house calls.

People tend to get, uh, weary

of the dreaded
insurance salesman.

Are you okay?

Uh, yeah. Sorry.

Sales is not for everyone,

especially door-to-door.
I-It's good.

I've been doing it a long time.
I-I know how to close.

Well, then,
I'll leave you to it.

Welcome to the playground.

Well, aren't you three
a lovely family?

Adorable.

They're joining the parish!
Oh, wonderful!

Ooh, Catholic!

Oh, speaking of adorable,

Tammy Reid called
Kathy We is man...

she's Jewish...

started calling
her daughter adorable,

and Kathy just went all...
I understand you do

life insurance
for people my age?

Oh, her premium is
ri-donk-ulous,

as they say on the streets.

He would love to.

If you have 15 minutes
of free time,

he could do a profile on you.

Right, honey?

Uh, sure.

Since my son will be
abandoning me

for his sacred bowling
tomorrow night,

I get home from bingo at 7:00.

Oh, but then I have to
feed Zeus.

That's my kitty.
I'd like 7:30, to be safe.

No problem. 7:30 it is.

Cats make the best pets.

Yes, they do, sweetie.

They serve Him well.

Serve who, sweetie?

The Dark Lord.

Rosalie.

You are excused.

Now.

What in the Jiminy Crickets
was that?

Your, uh, daughter <i>always</i>
talk like that,

Mr. and Mrs. Snyder?

She's having such a rough time

adjusting
to the new environment.

I'm, uh, thinking about
taking her to the reservation.

No!
No!

Not the best idea.

Oh, don't be so dramatic.
It's just legend.

The reservation
does not respect this town.

You know, some people say
they're evil,

but I don't get involved
with the gossip.

They're just not good people.

Bad things happen to anyone
who associates.

Uh, look at Roger Stenson

and Charlie Furber.

The Leavenger family.

What... What happened to them?

Each visited the reservation
at some point in time.

Every time after each visited,

one bad thing after another.

Now, I don't want to use
the word "curse."

It's a strong word, but, well...

Young lady, you and your husband

best stay <i>away</i> from that place.

It's cursed.

That is a strong word, Mother.

It's cursed!

I suppose the kid jumped!

You can't just throw someone
out of a tree house

because you don't like them.

He could have been killed,
honey.

He wasn't.

Thank you so much
for inviting us.

Oh, no problem.

I'm so glad you finally accepted
my play-date invite.

Sorry it took so long.

We haven't had a lot of time
for play dates lately.

Must be so hard
being the new kid in town.

It's fine. An adjustment.

It's a process.

Can I ask you
a personal question?

I... suppose.

Do you ever feel like
the walking dead?

I mean, since I had Anna,
I just...

zone out, you know? Like I...

feel like I'm just
going through the motions

and waiting for my life
to finish its course.

Well, I-I think that feeling
wears off after time, Alice.

We have to do more of these.

Yeah.

She's getting worse.
Did you see her face?

What if she's doing
these things?

What if she did it?

It's not <i>her.</i>

She's my baby, too.

If you don't do your job,
we're going to lose her forever.

Rosalie, are you excited
to learn about

the first people
to ever live on this land?

No.

Rosalie!
No! No! No! No!

No! No!
Rosalie! Stop it!

Stop it now!

There is no hope for her here.

She must leave.

Please.

I will speak with <i>you,</i>
and you only.

But she has to go.

It's okay.
Um, we'll wait at the car.

No.

She cannot be on these grounds.

Come.

Sit.

How did you know
who my daughter was?

Oh, I didn't.

I felt her... her evil...

The second
she got out of that car.

And she can never step foot
on these grounds again.

That's not her.

You... are not evil.

I see you suffer.

But I can't see all of you.

Why did you invite me in here
if she can't be saved?

Ah. I didn't say that
she can't be saved.

And I-I don't know
that she <i>can</i> be saved.

I said she cannot
step foot on these grounds.

Your daughter is going to
destroy you and her mother.

If she can be saved... how?

You must reclaim her.
Reclaim?

I don't know what that means.

Are you a-a-a witch
or something?

I guess some would say so.

I'm a seer. I practice the arts.

Mm. The dark arts?

There is no dark
without the light.

It's all a part
of the same circle.

If you are in a dark room,

the darkest of dark rooms,

as dark as a black hole,

you could bring the tiniest
pinprick of light.

Tiniest match can lead you all
out of the darkness.

It's what you do with it
that determines what it is.

Magic?

Everything is magic.

And there's no such thing
as magic.

I... I'm called Floating Hawk.

People say your land is cursed.

One man's curse
is another man's blessing.

I'm not into riddles.
I want my daughter back.

You are not in any position
to be making demands,

are you, Daniel?

And until you are
100% transparent with me,

only then perhaps we can have
a heart-to-heart.

Go. Clear your head.

Then return.

Know this...

Only death can save her.

Only death can set her free.

Harlan?

What happened to bowling night?

The storm?

Harlan?

How can we know what she meant?

And why are you <i>so</i> willing
to trust this woman?

You know we made a deal.

We really don't have any
other choice but to honor it.

How's that been working out
for us so far?

Nothing we've ever done
has made any difference.

And what she is suggesting?

Rosalie must die
in order to be saved?

Are you insane?

She didn't say Rosalie must die.

She said, "Only death
will save her."

Something about reclaiming.

I want to go back,
find out more.

Just... Just be open.
That's all I'm asking!

I don't know.

I want our daughter back.

Look at her.

She's gone.

I want her back, too.

Do what you want.

But, in the meantime,

<i>please...</i>

let's just do
what we <i>have</i> to do.

Just sell her insurance.

Insurance.

Mrs. Lester?

Hello?

Mrs. Lester?

No, no, no, no, no!

It's impossible.

My mother would never
commit suicide.

She's Catholic.
She would never disobey God.

A-A-And did you see
how high that branch was?

80 year-old woman gonna
c-climb up that?

Give me a break.

Hi. Thank you
for inviting me in.

Lovely day, isn't it?

I think this is gonna save you
a lot of trouble,

and mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

What a lovely home.

I hope that you can keep it.

I think that you can,
if you sign this.

Well, at this point, I don't
really have a choice, do I?

No, you don't.

Yeah.

Sign.

No graveyard shift tonight?

Day off.

Man, I-I'm sorry.

Nah, I can't sleep.

Beer thirty?

Sure.

I know some people already
suspect you for what happened.

But could've been me who went
to her house tonight.

People are crazy.

Mm. That old bat Betty Goss says
shit like, uh,

"All the bad stuff
started happening"

when you guys got here.

Yeah, right, Betty.

Like nothing bad
ever happened here

before the Snyders got here.

Get a life,
you bag of smoked lard.

What's eatin' you, brother?

I'm sorry I said all that
about the bad stuff happening...

No, no, it's alright.

It's alright.

Want another one?

Sure.

Yeah, this town's
a cesspool of gossip.

Gotta run to the outside fridge.
Be back in a minute.

Yeah. No prob.

Exploring?

Yeah, yeah.

It looks like you got
some cool relics there.

Curious, you know,
where they came from

and, uh, what they mean.

All the relics
have different meanings,

but the coolest one

was the one you were looking at.

How do you know which one
I was looking at?

Because it moved.

Wow. You're good.

No, this particular one
is an ancient relic

discovered in Mesopotamia.

It's said to be a tool of
The Harbinger.

The Harbinger is like a sign
or omen of things to come.

In this particular myth,
the Harbinger

is a traveler doomed to Hell

unless he does
the devil's bidding.

And with him...

comes damnation.

For what purpose?

Try to get as many people
as possible

to kill themselves
so he can claim their souls.

How do they get people
to kill themselves?

The serpent relic.

It's pure evil, forged in Hell,

and influences people
to commit suicide.

The Harbinger's job
is to drop the relic

within the vicinity
of the victims.

Why... Why can't he just
kill the people?

He can, but just because
he kills them

doesn't mean he gets them.

Your only way to true damnation
is through suicide.

And, uh, he'll stop at nothing
to get you there.

He, uh, can't just drop
the relic himself?

Why does he need Harbingers?
To cover more ground.

He sends one Harbinger
to each town.

But there are too many towns,

so he's always looking
for more Harbingers.

He uses leverage to get people
to sign the contracts,

people who have done bad things

or made bad deals,
what have you.

If he can hold something
over your head,

he's got you.

So these Harbingers...
They go around

to all these different towns
to get as many people

to off themselves as possible.

And if they don't?

Hell if I know.

Wait a second. Wait a second.

You have the tool
of the Harbinger,

the serpent relic,
in your house.

Why haven't you killed yourself?

You... What...
You don't really believe

all that malarkey, do you?

I mean, I guess if a Catholic
commits suicide,

going against God and all that,

but then again,
to try to get me to believe

that there's some dude
working for the devil

who can make you kill yourself
using some little trinket?

Well, gotta be Linda Lovelace
to swallow that pill.

Makes for a cool story, though.

Ah, here.

You can have this one.

Doesn't do jack shit,
but, uh, well, it looks cool.

What are you guys doing?

Honey, have you seen
my briefcase?

Mr. Snyder.

Uh, Detective Tracy Hennings.

You mind if I have
a quick moment?

Uh, no, not at all.

Uh, I got your statements.

I just wanted to confirm
something.

Now, you said you saw Harlan
<i>after</i> you found Mrs. Lester.

Is that right?

Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

I, uh, called out
and no one answered.

Mm. Any chance he could have
been inside the house

and just not answered
when you called out?

I suppose he could have been.
I really don't know.

Did... Did you ask him?
Oh, we will.

We will.

You said you're from a town
in Iowa called Huntsville.

Is that right?
Yes. That's right.

Well, here's the thing.

I can't find a Huntsville
in Iowa anywhere.

Well, i-it's, uh, more of
an unincorporated area.

I-I just say Des Moines.

Ah! I gotcha.

Ah, just one more thing.

Now, where is it?

Des Moines, huh?
Everybody knows where that is.

Ah, here it is.

Uh, does this mean anything
to you?

Uh, no, sir.
Where'd you find that?

At the crime scene, obviously.

Crime scene?

I thought she committed suicide.

Well, here's another thing.

It's troubling.

How does an 80-year-old woman
get up in a tree like that?

Well, you think of anything
you want to tell me,

anything at all, you go ahead
and give me a call.

Thank you, Detective. Will do.

Okay.

What do you want from me?!

What is it?

I can't find the girls anywhere.

They were playing in the back
near the woods,

and I am this close
to calling the police.

Rosalie!
Anna!

Mommy!

Ah!

Anna!

What did I say
about these tunnels?

I couldn't stop her, Mommy.
She just kept going.

I told her about the ghosts,
and she wouldn't listen.

Ghosts?

Mobsters in the Prohibition Era
used to hide from the cops

in these old mining tunnel
systems.

People like to say
the town is haunted,

but we know that's just stories,
now, don't we, girls?

Yes, Mommy.

Right, Rosalie?

The Harbinger has come.

He is here.

What's a Harbinger?

It's something she read
and keeps repeating.

Have you cleared your head?

Floating Hawk, I have, uh,

never been one
to be 100% transparent.

In my life, I have had

so many people to protect.

But I failed.

Good, Daniel. Keep going.

Nothing personal.
I have trust issues.

I...

I don't know how to say this.

I don't know you.

Surely, you can understand

I am risking everything
by being here.

Little brother,
you've lost everything.

What else do you have to risk?

The devil has
my daughter's soul.

And he has forced me to do
something terrible

in order to get her back.

I will go to the ends
of the Earth

to find another way to save her.

Trust goes both ways, Daniel.

I still can't see all of you.

But I know what you say is true.

There is no prayer or chant
or spell or song

that can save your daughter.

Are you going to drown
in a puddle of tears,

or do you want to
try another way?

Hmm?

What I'm about to tell you
has never been verified,

not by me anyway.

Your people have a legend
of Ehud the Judge.

You know it?

An evil, fat king was killed
by a servant of God,

and the dagger expelled
the filth and dirt

from the king before he died.

As a girl, our elders told us
the story of that blessed dagger

being brought here by pilgrims.

It is now next to
the Auclair crypt

underneath the oval stone.

Our people respect the story
and never go near it.

Are you saying
a dagger to stab the devil?

No.

According to legend...

your daughter.

"Only death will save her."

My daughter has to die?!

What the story
doesn't tell you...

It's the evil that dies.

But if the evil is expelled
and good remains,

true life returns.

That's a story.

There's no dagger.

Trust.

But verify.

If I stab my daughter
with a dagger, she's dead.

Yes, but there are two things
you must consider.

One... you have no other option.

And two... she's already dead.

<i>That blessed dagger is now
by the Auclair crypt,</i>

<i>underneath the oval stone.</i>

Ah!

What brings you to the party?

You can't possibly know
anyone here, can you?

Oh! Shit.

How can I be such an idiot?

Mrs. Lester, right?

Uh, yeah.

I'm sorry you had to be
the one to find her, man.

Come on.
Mrs. Lester's buried this way.

That other half of the cemetery
is on Indian land.

Supposedly cursed,
like they said the other night.

I don't really believe
that crap, but, uh,

still, you, uh, don't ever
want to dip a toe on that side,

not because it's cursed,
but, uh,

because then you have to
deal with them.

Eh, and don't ever talk to them.

I don't really believe
they're evil,

but, uh, the ones not getting
the casino money

are just looking for a handout.

Trust me.

Well, I'm, uh... I'm really
sorry about Mrs. Lester.

If... If you don't mind,
I'm gonna stroll around.

I'm kind of a history buff.

You got it.

Don't beat yourself up, bud.

Thanks, John.

Oh, God, no.

In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Amen. Go in peace, my child.

Would you bless this, too,
Father?

You must leave these premises.

I assure you
she is a sweet child.

She's just a little lost.

Please bless us.

Leave this place!

<i>The death of Irene Lester</i>

<i>has sent shock waves
throughout the community.</i>

<i>Lester was found hanging
in her backyard.</i>

<i>Authorities
have not ruled out suicide</i>

<i>but ask to keep speculation
to a minimum</i>

<i>as the investigation
is still pending.</i>

<i>In other news, a new report</i>

<i>from the Office of
Homeland Greatness...</i>

<i>...news and weather at the top
and bottom of every hour.</i>

<i>Now back to St. Herald son's
greatest hits on WDDL.</i>

Hi, Grandpa!

No, no, no, we don't sell
that kind of insurance.

Let me show you
what we're talking about.

No need. I trust you.

No, no, no, no, no.

I insist.

Dry up and go chase yourself,
bub.

<i>Daniel...</i>

Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

Did you close the Mayer account?

Got interrupted.

Well, it's always something.

His granddaughter showed up.

I can't bring myself to do
any of these jobs.

You don't have a choice.

Just do the job
so that we can get her back.

I can't. I <i>won't.</i>

I <i>have</i> to find another way.

When are you gonna accept
there <i>is</i> no other way?

Never.
I will never accept that.

What you're toying with,
the risk...

It's... it's just too high.
How can you say that?!

You know, if you hadn't made

certain decisions
with your life,

we wouldn't be making this one
right now.

Hey! I loved her, too!

You think it doesn't torment me
every day?!

I go to sleep every night,
and I see her smiling face.

I wake up thinking I'm gonna
see it again, only to realize

I'm in the same Goddamn
repeating nightmare!

And you don't think I miss her?!

You don't think I'm heartbroken?
We are living in Hell on Earth.

<i>Daniel...</i>

Baby, what's wrong?

I know of whom you speak.

Mommy and Daddy
are not upset with you.

Where did you get that?

The end of the tunnel.

Daniel?

What happened?

It was awful, Theresa.

But I have to.

I have to.

What can you tell me
about these objects?

You need to be very careful,
Daniel.

In the wrong hands,

these objects are dangerous,

deadly,

otherworldly.

You know the Harbinger myth?

I'm told one of these is
the tool of The Harbinger.

This is the tool
of The Harbinger.

I got something else for you.

You <i>are</i> a do-er, Daniel.

And you acquired this how?

My daughter says she found it
in the tunnels.

What?

Is there a way to test it?

I don't know.

I can't see.

Part of the problem
is not the dagger.

It's you.

Let me see.

I washed my hands.

It doesn't matter.
It's inappropriate.

Yeah, Daddy.
Yeah.

Whoa. Easy.

Oh!
What are you doing?

Really?

I had it,
but you over corrected.

Mm. Really?
How about you try some?

Oh! Somebody's toast!

She's toast!

No, no, no!

Your love is strong.

Hey, this is actually
really good. Try some.

Aah!

Oh, we got two burnt pieces
of toast coming right up!

The bald man...

He scares you.

Come back when you are ready
to face him.

Keep this safe.

Can you think of any enemies
you may have made

since you arrived to town?

No.

Well, I will compile all this
in my report, ma'am,

and get it submitted ASAP.

I'll just leave my card here
on the table.

Thank you, Officer.

You just gonna spy on me
and my wife for eternity?

I have nothing to say to you.

I didn't kill your mother.

Hey, neighbies. What's cookin'?

Give him time, Daniel.

<i>Daniel...</i>

<i>Daniel...</i>

Hi, honey.

Do you remember your daughter?

Yes.

Very much so.

Do you?

Not really.

Please sleep,
my baby darling girl.

Aah!

Oh, my God.

Police are investigating...

What happened?

Like you don't know.

Stabbed in the eyes
with a letter opener.

Ma'am, let the investigation
disclose.

You are not welcome
in this town!

Take your murdering husband
and freak daughter

and get the hell outta here!
Ma'am, relax.

Yeah, put your tail between
your legs and run, bitch!

Mr. Snyder!

Detective.

Talk soon.

Oh.

You didn't get my text?

No.

Uh... just with all of
the insanity,

Betty thought...

<i>I</i> think that we should just wait

for this whole thing
to blow over

before the girls...
Betty thought?

W-What whole thing?

Theresa, please don't do this.

You have to admit that
Rosalie's...

I have to go.

Wh...

Alice!

It's a play date,
for God's sake!

Go to hell, Alice!
You go to hell!

Betty is a mean person.

She will receive a comeuppance.

She's just scared, Theresa.
The whole town's on edge.

Hello.

Oh, evening, Detective.

Oh.

I see.

I'll be... I'll be right there.

He says Betty drove her car
off a cliff.

Come on, Daniel,
just level with me.

Help me help you.

I have no explanation,
Detective.

That's not gonna be good enough.

Now, you're either committing
these acts, or you know who is,

unless you got someone who
really just doesn't like you.

I can't think of anyone.

All right.

What do you know about this?

Found that in Betty's car.

What is that?
What's that look on your face?

This doesn't make any sense.

Well, no shit, Shirley.

Don't you think
it's in your best interest

to just tell me what you know?

I'm sorry, Detective.
I-I have no clue. This...

Now, how do I know I'm gonna
find your DNA on this one, too?

You know, this is cause
for a warrant right here.

I was hoping you'd be
a little more cooperative.

I have no problem with you
obtaining a warrant, Detective.

I have nothing to hide.

I've been seeing things.

I always do.

What kind of things, sweetie?

You know, if you wanted
to talk to us about anything,

ever, we're here for you.

You know that, right?

There once was a cockroach
and a fly.

The fly said to the cockroach,

"If you come into the house
with me,

I'll share my take with you."

The cockroach said, "Sure,"
and went in with the fly.

As soon as they were
in the door,

a boot smashed the cockroach.

The fly flew to the kitchen,

grabbed a piece of rancid
meat out of the garbage,

and flew to the door.

But before he made it out
the door, it shut.

The fly landed on the door,

waiting for an opportunity
to escape.

Then, smack!

A fly swatter splatted the fly's
guts all over the door.

What's the point
of the story, honey?

It doesn't matter if you are
the cockroach or the fly.

We all end up the same way.

Good night.

My baby.

Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Ho!

Oh, hey, Danny.
Look what I got.

Ask and you shall receive.

Are you Snyder?
Yes, sir.

I'm Sam Watkins,
a code investigator.

Your fence is not up to code,

and your garage
is not up to code,

and I have a city permit

to inspect your house.

Oh, this is such petty bullshit!

When it rains it pours.
Go ahead, guys.

Search the premises.

Search the place.
You, too, for all I care.

But, let's just call this
what it is... a witch hunt!

Well, whatever you want.

What's the problem?

Repo. Pay your bills, man.

I'm current on my loan.
Not my problem.

I knew you'd be behind all this.

Oh, let's see what we got.

He's got one of those snake
sticks in his briefcase.

Daniel Snyder,
you're under arrest.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you do and say
can be used against you

in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.

What's the charge?
Murder.

The murders of Irene Lester,
Harlan Lester, and Betty Goss.

You got him?
Yep.

Get him in the car.

Ah!

<i>Theresa...</i>

<i>Theresa...</i>

<i>There's only one way
to mend this.</i>

We have your briefcase
and your little stick.

You wanna tell me...

why you have
insurance policies in it

that expired three years ago?

That's a crime?

All right, let's talk turkey.

You plead guilty...
No death penalty.

I have done nothing.
I swear it.

And I want my phone call.

Wow, neighbor.

World of shit, huh?

John, there's something
serious I have to tell you.

I don't know how to say it,
but I have to.

Jesus. What is it?

Theresa and I have a past.

I guess we all do.

What, did you kill someone?

My background is in finance.

I was approached by
a businessman with a proposal.

If we're smart about it,

the ROI for our investors
is above 1,000%.

We ran a Ponzi scheme
on Wall Street.

We and our investors...
We made millions.

I didn't know what a Ponzi was.

I just knew that it was
beautiful, until it wasn't.

And just like Bernie Madoff
said,

it didn't start off
with bad intentions.

But, as so often happens,
shit spiraled out of control.

We couldn't pay back investors.

We were screwed.
The investors were screwed.

My partner and I
were heading for prison.

Theresa and I knew it.

One day, a man showed up
at our door.

I don't want to go into detail
about how horrifying

this particular individual is,
but he offered me a deal.

And mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

He said I could avoid
going to jail.

He'd pay back all my investors
on one condition...

I had to do a job for him.

Do you remember telling me
the story of The Harbinger?

Y-Yeah.

How much do you believe it?

About as much as I believe
in Santa Claus. Why?

This man told me
if I did this job,

my family would never be
in financial danger again.

Now, the job is unspeakable.

I couldn't bring myself
to do it,

even if it meant
avoiding poverty and prison.

When he realized this,

he took my daughter's spirit
until the job is done.

Your daughter's spirit?

What if I were to tell you
Santa Claus is real?

You... Wh... You're telling me
there's a Harbinger?

I'll tell you everything if
you are willing to hear me out.

Answer first. You're saying
there <i>is</i> a Harbinger.

I need to know
you're gonna hear me out.

You first, or I'm walking
through that door.

You're saying
there's a Harbinger.

No, John, I'm telling you
<i>I'm</i> The Harbinger.

But I want out.

<i>My mother would never
commit suicide.</i>

<i>She's Catholic.
Can you think of any enemies</i>

<i>you may have made?
Found that in Betty's car.</i>

<i>Stabbed in the eyes
with a letter opener.</i>

I came here to do these things.

I couldn't bring myself
to do them,

which means
someone <i>else</i> is doing it.

I need your help.

Uh... why am I here
and not your wife?

What does she think
about all this?

She's part of it.
My family needs your help, John.

I figured <i>you</i> of all people
would believe me.

You know the story.
You have the relics!

But they're replicas.

They came with little...
Uh, little booklets.

I got 'em for a dollar each
at a yard sale.

I-If you told me this when
you weren't in trouble,

I still would have thought
you were bat shit crazy,

but, uh, now that you're sinking
without a lifeboat, mm.

John, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

He says if I take enough souls,
we get Rosalie back.

But he's a con!

I-I may have another way to save
her, but I need out of here!

John! There is no one else
I can go to!

I'm sorry, Daniel.

Ugh!

You sure you didn't make
more than one phone call?

You made bail.
Must have a guardian angel.

Hey!

Hey!

I need to talk to you!

How much time do I have
before she's gone?

Do I have any time?

The bald man.

I'm ready to face him.

I have been waiting
for this moment.

First I have a confession
to make.

I know who you are.
I know what you are.

If you know what I am,

you know
I'm not the only one here.

I need your help.

What are you not telling me?!

Come and have some tea, Daniel.

You're a tough one, Daniel.

You're still a bit...

hidden from me.

But your heart and your will
are here.

Here you go.

And here we go.

In 1647, the first white
fur traders arrived here.

The settlers were not
far behind.

They did not understand
our ways,

and we certainly
did not understand theirs.

Along with them came
their illnesses, mythology,

their deity, and, of course,

their anti-deity.

But Luc, or Lucifer
as he was called then,

was new to this world as well.

He didn't understand
that some land

was our sacred burial ground.

He had to learn the hard way.

Because he knew he had no power
on our domain...

...over time he made a promise

to leave our people alone,

and he guaranteed it
with an official treaty ceremony

taking place with him
on his land,

and our people on ours.

But naturally,
he broke his promise.

Whenever one of us
ventured off our land,

he took advantage.

Through the years, Luc learned
where he had power,

where he did not.

Our people cursed him,
along with his followers

and those who disturbed
our grounds.

From then on, Luc dared not
cross the boundary.

Although <i>he</i> learned
the lay of the land,

the settlers did not.

Time and time again,
and across generations,

they buried their dead
on sacred ground.

These souls could not be claimed
by Luc <i>or</i> God.

Your people are right.

They <i>are</i> cursed.

Luc had quite the silver tongue.

He promised that
if they collected enough souls,

he would lift the curse.

But no matter how many souls
The Harbingers collect,

it is never enough.

He tricked 'em.

And that does not bode well
for you,

my poor, poor, dear boy.

Give it to me.

This is the dagger
made by your God.

To resurrect her,
you must plunge the dagger

deep into her chest.

The evil will pour from her,
expelling the dagger.

Once her body and soul
are restored,

your contract with Luc
is null and void.

Rosalie will never go willingly.

Spike her drink with this.

It will put her in a trance long
enough for you to get her in.

I have something for you.

Where did you get this?

This has been missing
from our people for generations,

centuries.

Valuable enough to lift
the curse?

Daniel.
That is not for me to say,

It is beyond my realm
of knowledge.

Those curses come from
the spirits,

but dare I say it couldn't hurt.

I must give you something
in return of no less value.

But I have nothing.

Yes, you do.

The right half is
Native American land,

the left half non-Native.

Crypt is dead center.

They didn't realize when
they built that

that half of that
was on sacred ground, too.

Ironically, the one place
in the Christian world

he can't enter
is the house of the dead.

The crypt is where
the sacrifice has to...

Say no more.

Understand this.

The tunnels that lead
to that crypt

were used by gangsters
during Prohibition.

Their souls, among others,
still patrol.

It won't be easy.

But the tunnels lead
to the underground entrance.

If you look here, there's
an above-ground entrance.

We're not going
through the tunnels.

We're going in right here.

I would be shocked
if he allowed access

to the above-ground entrance.

But if you must, go in daylight.

He will move in quickly
if he suspects you have the key.

Otherwise, head for the tunnels.

This pipe-shaped one...
It's called a Helix,

and it will keep the spirits
at bay for a bit,

but you don't have long.

Get a hold of it. Oh!

You mean this?

Now, you weren't 100% correct
when you said

that he can't enter
the house of the dead.

If one of his cronies
gets a hold of...

the globe... this one...

He can be summoned.

I wish I could do more.

You have done plenty.

Uh, just out of curiosity,

what's the story
with the one I gave you?

The most revered object
of our people.

Man and nature
working in tandem.

In a peace offering, it is
the highest sign of respect

to a former enemy
a revered object.

You will notice,
in his trickery,

he gave us a key to a crypt

that he cannot even enter

and has no use to us.

We gave him The Eagle
and The Warrior.

What is its power?

Nothing.

And everything.

The time is now. You must go.

Go get your daughter back.

Daniel!
I know we can't afford it.

Who bailed you out?
You don't want to know.

We have to move fast.
Have Rosalie drink that.

What is this?

Did... Did that witch
give it to you?

Yes, the witch,
who is, in fact, our savior.

Trust me.
I need a little more

than blind faith right now.

Look me in the eye.
I know how to save her.

But we have to do it now.

I forgot my ID,
went back to the station.

That other detective shot
himself, committed suicide.

And I realized you were
right there, so okay.

I guess there is another one.

Wait. What?

I'm The Harbinger.

You gotta put yourself
in my position.

Imagine you're the only
Harbinger,

and some other schmo
tells you <i>he's</i> The Harbinger.

But I'm not dropping
these relics, either!

Oh! Oof.

The cops were scared, man.

But, uh, I'll tell you what.

I believe in Santa Claus now.

Why would he send
two Harbingers to one town?

Exactly. Something reeks.

I want out, too.

So give me the lowdown.
What's the plan?

Be sure Rosalie doesn't hear
any of this.

Have her drink it,
then bring her down.

The sacrifice.

The sacrifice?

That can only be done with
the dagger made by God Himself!

I have it.
You're shittin' me.

Okay. Okay.
So how do I help?

You need your Helix
for yourself.

I never go anywhere without it.

You expecting someone?

Shit!

It can't wait for daylight.

I have to go now.

Just let him in, Daniel.

Just do it his way.

Baby, I just need you to hold
on a little bit longer for me.

Okay?

If it all ends, so be it,
but we gotta try, okay?

You've always been stronger
than me.

Will you do it for Rosalie?

Come on, baby. Come on.

Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop.

Stop, stop, stop.

Nice and easy.

Don't call attention.

What do we do?

I thought he couldn't hurt us
on Indian land.

He doesn't need to.
His presence alone stops us.

We have to go
through the tunnels.

Under different
circumstances, I'd say,

that's... cool.

The tunnels are on
the Christian side,

so have your Helix in hand.

We're not safe until we get
inside and the door is closed.

Just remember, slow is smooth.

Smooth is fast.

Let's move.

So much for that. Faster.

This way.

Honey.

Come on, baby.

See you guys on the other side.

Let's go this, baby. Come on.

Oh, aah!
There's something in my shoe.

Keep moving, honey.
No. Just a second.

Aah! Ah!

Theresa.

Teresa, can you run?

Where is she?

Where is she?

Where is she?

<i>Ahhhh. Daniel...</i>

Go.

John, keep an eye on the tunnel.

Teresa, shine your light
on the wall.

We're in the den of the devil
or on cursed Indian land.

Either way, we're...

Look for a keyhole.

Why did she give me this key?!

Aah!

Get in. He can't enter.

Get in.

Close!

Come on, baby.

I can't go through with it.

Theresa's right.
It might not work.

<i>Now</i> you decide that?

It <i>won't</i> work.

<i>If his cronies get a hold
of the globe,</i>

<i>he can be summoned.</i>

Who are you?

He's been summoned.

Okay.

All right, you win.

Devil's coming.

There's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

You guys win.

Aaah!

A a a a a a a a a a ah!

Ah!

Daniel, look out!

A a a a ah!

Aah! A a a a a ah!

Aah!

A a a a a a a ah!

Aaah!

Before I kill you, John,
you should know I'm never

gonna stop till these souls
are free.

Your sweetheart boss can't touch
this town anymore.

He'll be here any moment.

Tell him yourself.

Where's the dagger?

Where's the dagger?!

What do I do now?

It's pointless to worry
about what you can't control.

It is not safe for him to enter.

We are forbidden to interfere
with any contract

someone has with him.

No talking to, no touching,
no helping Harbingers,

lest we ourselves
risk damnation.

I almost gave in to temptation

when you reached
to open your door to me,

but thankfully regained
my resolve.

Now...

it is too late.

What are you?

Emissary.

Harbinger Protector.

And Angel.

Is there a way I can help you?

No.

He hit me with the dagger.

The dagger hit me, too.

You can live.

If the dagger pierces
my kind, our earthly form

in this world is...

over.

We need your help.
Are there more of you?

I was all you had.

Only so many soldiers
to go around.

God... be... with...

Whatever happens, Daniel,

do not let go of this thing.

He left it for a reason.

Mm-hmm.

Theresa!

How's the family?

Oh, Daniel, you perplex me.

How is it you can be so lost

in a world of lost souls?

I would think
you'd fit right in.

Daniel, I want to show you
something.

What do you say we pop up
and get a breath of fresh air?

You can't possibly think
I'm that stupid.

Well, look at you.

What I want to show you
can't be seen down here.

It's a surprise.

It's educational.

And to be fair,
it's... it's safe.

Whatever you can show me
up there,

you can show me right here.

I was gonna give you
a chance to save your daughter,

but never mind, you blew it.

I could have caught you
in the cemetery.

I could have
killed you in your bed.

But then we'd be missing out
on all this fun!

Save it!

We both know killing me
won't get you what you want.

So you've been running off

to see your new girlfriend
on the Indian land.

Did that old hag make mention
of you being blocked?

Not being able
to fully read you?

Well, since she <i>failed,</i>

let me unblock you.

I can only erase the memories
of a past life so many times

before you start losing
the faith earlier in each one,

sooner and sooner,
to the point where

you're just a couple
of bad apples.

You just become worthless.

In your first lifetime,

you were dropping relics
like fliessssss

It made me want
to keep bringing it back.

You fell off a bit
in your next couple.

I kept having to bait you with,

"I'll reverse the Indian curse!"

You were actually an easy one.

I'd wager you'd do anything
to remove your curse.

But your last lifetime,
it was embarrassing.

And this one...
What kind of a Harbinger

only drops one relic?

And you could only bring
yourself to do it that one time

because he was the one who roped
you into the Ponzi scheme

in the first place.

And he used his wife
as a punching bag.

<i>You</i> are the worst Harbinger
I've ever had.

Sell her the insurance.

And even when I took
your daughter's soul,

you couldn't
bring yourself to do it.

You serve no purpose for me.

So let me show you
what I've done.

You see, I knew a long time ago

that you were
no longer effective.

But what you didn't count on

is that this isn't just a town
where Harbingers are sent.

You weren't brought here
to doom anyone.

This is a town of ex-Harbingers.

They're already doomed.

This is a town

where Harbingers are sent
to be, uh, retired.

Not getting it?

Need me to spell it out for you?

This is one big theater show

to get you to kill yourselves,

to harass you enough
to get you... retired.

And you can't save them either.
They're already dead.

Like your daughter.

St. Herald son is literally

Hell on Earth.

Now do you want
to see what's up there?

Well, too bad!

There's only one way
out of this crypt

for the Snyders now,
and that's down.

Down! You had your chance.

You had your chance!
<i>Buenos noches. Arrivederci.</i>

<i>Adieu! Buenos noches!</i>

Good night.
Good night!

Ah. Hmm.

I see you've had a visitor.

Aah!

Aah!

Ow!

A a a ah!

The wrong side of the crypt.

You can't defeat me.

A a a a a ah!

Ah!
No!

Don't hurt him!

Aah! Aah!

<i>Do you remember your daughter?</i>

No!

Now you've just pissed me off.

I gave you the chance
to save your daughter

if you did my bidding.

You failed me!

Then you reject
my generous offer tonight.

You insulted me!

I revoke my offer.

I condemn you
to an eternity of servitude,

and your daughter's soul
is lost forever.

<i>Sin-bay R'el-bay</i>

<i>Ei-ou-ah-bum E-Noh</i>

<i>Kay-shal Fee-loch-Nebeum!</i>

<i>That's</i> your only option now.

See you in Hell.

<i>Only death can save her.
Only death can set her free.</i>

Me for her.

Why should I bargain?

I have your soul already.

If you win my soul,
you have me forever.

Ooh.

Done.

Daniel!

I love you, baby.

Goodbye, my sweet baby girl.

Ah.

Mommy?

Ah.

Ah! Ah!

Hi, baby.

Oh, baby! Oh!

No, no, no. No, come on.

No, no.

I don't know how this happened.

What?

What is that?

If the Card of Death
is present during his curse,

the souls are restored.

Where did you get it?

Him.

Told me where to find
the dagger, too.

Good for you.

I love a challenge.

Yessssss!

A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a ah!

You and Rosalie have suffered
because of my choices.

I'm sorry, Theresa.

Thank you for sticking with me.

We have the knowledge
and the tools now.

This town, others out there...

We could help them, Theresa.

How many of those Harbinger
Protectors are out there?

Time to find out.

<i>In every lifetime,
he has tested me</i>

<i>and I've failed.</i>

<i>For whatever reason,</i>

<i>I've been given a second chance
in this lifetime.</i>

<i>How many other Rosalies
out there can I save?</i>

<i>How many others
are forced to be...</i>

<i>The Harbinger?</i>
