I'm gonna miss you, Will.

Mmm-hmm.

Little afternoon

I'm okay, Tommy.

No, I quit.

Why would you do that?

He wants to spend more

Spend all your time here.

Well, I do.

We're gonna miss you,

Thank you. Thank you.


So, you finally made it

Yes.

You have some brilliant ideas in your head.
Let them out.

You think?

You don't want to be chained to
your desk as an old editor, do you?

No.

Here. Best contractor

Can't do it

I shall miss you.

Good luck.

Thank you.

Hey.

Hey, Atenton!

Will. How you doing?
Heather. Heather Keeler.

I found your house.
Yes, sorry.

Yes. Yes. Bramble Branch.

How are you doing?
I'm well.

Do you need a lift?

No, no,
I'm getting a taxi.

A cab in this weather?
Come on. I'll give you a lift.

WILL: No, no, Heather.
Mine's the one on the left.

But you know that,
don't you?

HEATHER: Okay, here we are.
Enjoy your new home.

Thank you.
You have a good night.

Good night.

LIBBY: Sweetie, I just wanted to know,
did you get the 7:15?

'Cause I really don't know whether
to put the kids to bed or not.

So, give me a call or let me know... (THUDDING)

Oh, Jesus!

Oh, Will! (LAUGHS)

You gave me a fright.

Crazy.

the phone? What's going on?

What?


You didn't? You didn't?

You didn't think I would,
did you? I didn't think you would.

I'm so proud of you!

Oh, we're gonna be
so much happier.

The kids are gonna
be so much happier.

Where are they?

Oh, the kids are asleep.

Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

Mrs. Atenton.

Mr. Atenton.


WILL: What's this?

LIBBY: Oh, this is
the kids' painting.

Um...

Have the children
gone to bed?

Yeah, the children
are very...

They're very tired.
I put them in bed.

And they've been working all day?
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah?
Yeah.

(MUFFLED GIGGLING)

I'll just put my coat

What have you been doing?

Um, painting!

DEE DEE: Painting!
WILL: Oh, really?

Sweetie, you wanna show
Daddy the surprise?

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LIBBY: Yeah, yeah, yeah?

That surprise.

Okay, ready, Dee Dee?

One, two, three, go!


Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.

Really?
Yeah.

Honestly?
Yeah, you're hired.

You can't afford me.

I think
I might be able to.

(LIBBY LAUGHING)

What is that?
There's a very strange smell around here.

You! You!

I know what it is.
Mmm-hmm.

It's stinky kids.

Stinky kids.

Stinky kids need bath time!

Are you gonna tell me
what this novel's about?

If I tell you

Well, then it all disappears,

But I can see the characters, Libby.
I can.

Just... Just as
clearly as I can...

Thank you.
...as I can see you now.

Thanks for the flowers.

When? I didn't
give them to you.

I found them on the porch
this morning.

They're probably
from a secret admirer.

Of yours.

No.
Maybe.

Some gentleman caller leaving
you flowers on the doorstep.



I feel so safe
when you're here.

Well, I'm not gonna
go anywhere.

What are you

Ah, memories, maybe.

Hmm.

Do you remember this?

Forever.

I couldn't find him.

Where?

Show me.

He was right there.

What did he
look like, baby?

TRISH: She said
he had a big head.

And it was fuzzy.

LIBBY: (CHUCKLES) Fuzzy?

Sweetie, do you mean
a pretend person?

Is that what
you're talking about?

Wait a minute.
I know what you saw. Look.

You saw the twigs at the bottom of the garden.

Looks like...
That looks like a man, see?

No, he was right there.

Wait a minute.
Look at this.

Watch. Look at the window.
And...

See?

See? It was your own reflection.

When Trish turned on the light,
it wasn't a man, it was you, little one.

It was you.

Hey. What...
Who is it?

It's nothing, Libby.
It's just some kids.

They were just messing about.
Go back to bed. I'll be up in a minute.

Okay.

The department doesn't
close unsolved homicides,

so, officially,
the case is still open.

But I've only been on the job a couple of years,

so I don't know a lot
about the old cases.

You must be able to
tell me something.

I mean, who did it,
for Christ's sake?

Well, the focus came
down on the father.

Peter Ward.
He went a little nuts.

I thought you said the whole family were killed.

Well, the family was shot.
The father survived.

So he's still alive?

I don't really know.

Well, where is he?
CONKLIN: I don't know.

Look.
You can let me look at the case files and then...

I can't do that. It's police business.
No. I'll do it on my own.

Well, if you're not
gonna do it, I'll do it.

We can't hand it out
to the general public.

the general public, am l?

I mean, I bought the crime scene,

New Ashford is

So you got nothing
to worry about.

Have a nice day.

Take care now.

Libby?

Libby?

LIBBY: In here.

What's going on?

She heard the kid from across the street on her cell.

What did she say?

Everybody who lives in this house gets killed.

Oh, God Almighty.

Why would she say
something like that?

I told them we'd wait
till Daddy got home.

Okay. Let me...

Hi, there. Hi.

Look, were you talking on your

I just...
Mom!

Hi! I'm Will Atenton from across the street.
I wanted... Can l...

Can l...

Hi. Um, look, we...

We just found out what happened in our house.

to upset your daughter,

but I think she might
have been talking

with some friends on the phone,
near the house,

and my daughters overheard,
and they're five and seven and...

I know she didn't do it
on purpose. It's just...

I'll talk to her.

Thank you. Thank you.
That's all I'm asking.

You know,
it was the fifth anniversary a few days ago,

and my daughter's been
having nightmares again.

I'm sorry about that.
That's awful.

Did...

Did you leave some
flowers on our porch?

No.

What?

Right.
Okay, thank you.

The house has been
empty a long time.

Um...

Yes, except we've...

We've got an infestation of
teenagers in our basement.

And you...
You wouldn't know...

You wouldn't know...
Do they live around here?

I'd like to talk to their parents
just so I can keep them away.

Right.
I'm sorry to bother you.

Have a good day.

What's going on?

I'm just covering this up.
I couldn't sleep.

The ones I chased off?
They left this.

Who's Peter Ward?

Why didn't you

Because I didn't
want you to worry.

I just knew we shouldn't have moved out of the city.

Libby, don't say that.

I knew that this
wasn't gonna last.

What?
This!


There's something wrong
with this house.

No, Libby,
there isn't.


We'll do whatever it
takes, okay? We'll...

We'll hire a priest.

Where do you do that?

Well, it's... Or a witch doctor, whatever.
I don't know.

We'll feng shui the place.
It's our house. (CHUCKLING)

We found a little girl's clubhouse.

And you're having tea?

Yep.

You were?

We were looking

How long have you
been in here for?

When did you

About two hours.
What is this, baby?

Two hours.
Two hours ago?

You've been in here for two hours?
And how did you find it?

It's an amazing place.

I fell through the wall.

Oh, really?

You didn't hurt yourself?
No.

No. Look at
all these toys.

I fell in the box.

Look at that.

"This book belongs

And this belongs
to Beatrice, see?

that, sweetie.

Yeah, she wrote it

This is their

Okay, I need a cup of tea.

Yeah, I know.

(LIBBY SIGHS WEARILY)

That's our house, Will.

Yeah.

I mean,
how could the neighbors not have said anything to us?

I don't understand.
Nothing. Not a word.

Well, they're all freaked out about
having a murderer in their midst.

They just care about property prices,
that's all.

Jesus Christ.

He shot the little one

Hello.

I brought you some stew.

I thought you might like

With all the work you're doing in here,
you must be busy.

Thank you so much.
That's...

That's incredibly

Can you keep it down,

I should go.
Okay.

You'll come back?

Did you know the people

Why didn't you come

This is where

Okay.

I'm not.

Was Ward at Harkness House,
yes or no?

No, he wasn't,
but it's fine.

It's not fine.
You wanna know why it's not fine?

Because he was outside the window looking in.

I saw him!

Well, then we'll

He's not in Greenhaven.
Okay, the whole neighborhood...

He's back here!

You must have just passed him now on the road.

Did you see him?

Hooded parka.
Just calm down.

What are you taking notes for?
Get in the car and go after him!

Would you keep your
voice down, please?

You know what, I'm gonna get a gun,
I'll shoot him myself!

Go get some sleep, sir.

Oh, you guys,

Useless!

He's been in our house?

He had this.

Why are they not
helping us?

I really appreciate
you doing this.

I don't understand why the police won't help us.

Let's just make sure we're talking about the same man.

Please, sit down.

Peter Ward.

Well, I'm just...

I'm just trying to
protect my family.


WILL: What's that?

It's a gunshot wound.

I don't understand, why...
If he was a suspect, who...

Who shot him?

His wife.

Somehow she'd gotten
the gun away from him.

Fought back
before she died.

(TAPS KEYBOARD)

What's he screaming?

He wants to get out,
to find the man who killed his wife and children.

You filmed him
all the time?

We had to,
to protect ourselves.


He was not competent
to stand trial.

We held him as long as we could
without conclusive evidence.

Wait, can you...
Sorry.

Can you just rewind that a little,
just to there?

Stop.
(TAPS ON KEYBOARD)

Sir...


(TAPS ON KEYBOARD)

WILL: That's Ann Patterson.

She's... She lives
across the road from us.

I knew she knew him.

Let's go on.
You'll understand.

At a certain point,

he simply refused to believe that he was Peter Ward.

You see, in his mind,
if he wasn't Peter Ward,

he couldn't have killed his wife and family.

Well, what's
he doing now?

He refused to allow his name to
appear on any of the hospital IDs.

So he chewed them off

and invented a new name.

May l?
Sure.

That's...

All right.

Now I want to show you
something I showed you earlier.

From five years ago.

(TAPS ON KEYBOARD)

That's not Peter Ward.
That's...

That's me.

You lived in this institution for five years, Peter.

No.

That's...
That's ridiculous.

I'm not Peter Ward.
I'm Will Atenton.

That's the name
you gave yourself.

W1-1L becomes Will.

The numbers 8-10-10

become Atenton.

Will Atenton.

I don't believe
any of this.

You're a danger
to yourself.

And to others.

I'm sure the scar where your wife shot you is still there.

That would...

That would mean that...


No.

I left my wife and my family at home this morning.

You murdered your
wife and family

five years ago.


You're a fucking liar!

All right, move in.

McNulty, get in here.

Oh, nice.


Hello? Hi.

Hi. Where are you?

Nothing.
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

I love you, Libby.

I love you.

Will you just hold on
just a minute, please?

Oh, God, she's so cold, Will.
Will, please do something.

She's... She's not moving.
I need you to help, please.

Please, she's not...

What's going on? Dee Dee?

Come on, Dee Dee.
Dee Dee? Dee Dee?

God, Will, she's cold.
Trish? Trish?

Trish, come on. Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, come on. Dee Dee?

Why are you just
standing there?

Will, why are you
just standing there?

Wake up!

Why won't you
help your children?

Will!

Come on. Wake up!

Libby, they're dead.

You're dead.


Oh, please.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

MAN: Yes, sir. Good evening.

I wonder if you’d take a look at this for me, please?

Thank you.

(VEHICLE PULLS UP)

This is my home.

But it's not...

It's not fit for habitation,
Mr. Ward.

MAN 1: Okay, let's go.

MAN 2: Board it up now!

Libby! Libby!

Look out, buddy.

Libby!

(DRILL WHIRRING)

MAN: I'm sorry, sir.

(MEN SPEAKING ON RADIO)

Did you do this?

You don't remember me.

Yeah, I remember
you were...

You were here.

And you were
at Greenhaven...

You really see them.

They're there.

Look. Look!

They're buried at
New Ashford Cemetery.

(DOG BARKING)

What are you doing?

Trying to get
into my house.

Can't let you do that.

This house is condemned, buddy,
can't let anyone in here.

Have you been
watching me?

Goddamn right I have.
You're a killer.

Now get out of here.

Go on. Get out of here.

Where were you
that night?

I was alone,
here at the house.

I was supposed to
go out, but it was

snowing.

Chloe was with her
father, thank God.

Why did you visit
me in Greenhaven?

Because I was your neighbor from across the street.

Libby was my best friend.

Why didn't you
tell me who I was?

I wanted to,

but you told me you were Will Atenton.
What was I gonna say?

Did I do it?

No.

How do you know?

I just know.

CHLOE: Mom?

Hey, honey.
Hi.

Hi.

You...
You need a bath.


Yeah.

I guess
I'll run him a bath.


So,

Mom says you see them.

Yeah.

Are they older?

No, they're not.

Could you tell them
how much I miss them?

I will.

Did you leave the plant?

Yeah. It was
the anniversary.

Do you water it?

Yeah, I do.


ANN: Go get in the car,
honey.

Okay.

Bye.

Bye.
(DOOR OPENS)

The water is running.
I left some towels.

Don't go anywhere.

Thank you.

(CAR LOCK CHIRPS)

ANN: Are you okay?
Yeah.

Don't tell your father.



ANN: Will?

Yes.

I'll be down now.


Mom.

Oh, damn it.

What are you doing here?

I've heard Peter Ward's
been in our house.

No, he's not.

And it's not our house.
It's my house.

Come on, Chloe.
Get your stuff.

She's not yours
till Friday.

She's in danger.
He's a psychopath.

What are you talking
about, Jack? Just go.

JACK: Chloe...

No, it's fine, Mom.
I'll go.

Honey,
you don't have to go.

No, it's okay.
It's fine.

Good girl.

ANN: You're such an asshole.

Chloe! Where are you...

She's upset.

What do you expect?

Ann, I shouldn't even
be here. I'm sorry.

It's not your fault.
He's just... JACK: Chloe!

(ENGINE STARTING)

Look, I should
go after her.

But I found this
in the laundry.

Dr. Greeley.
She treated you at Greenhaven.

Thank you.

I think you should
call her.

Chloe!

Chloe!

Chloe!

WILL: Why did you release me?

I had no choice.
There was no evidence against you.

So I needed
to let you go.

How's the book?

I'm not writing a book.

I'm living in a fantasy and walking around my house,

talking to the walls.

Perhaps it's your mind
trying to protect itself.

From what?

Their deaths.
Or, the truth.

You think I did it?

I honestly don't know.

I don't care what my
mind's trying to do.

I just have to find out who killed my family,
even if it was me.

If you would admit
yourself here now

under my care,
I can treat you.

You're not well, Peter.

Mmm.

No, I'm not.


(GLASS CRACKING)

Oh, I hate it
when you leave!


Look.


I'm gonna beat you!
Come on!

The girls have been
waiting for you.

WILL: I love you.
Sleep tight.

Night, Daddy.

Tell me what you know
about that night.

I don't wanna do this.

You remembered
where you were shot.

I remember I heard someone
on the stairs and I came out.

I can't do this!

You heard somebody
on the stairs.

And I came out because I knew it was you.

And then I fell.

And...

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

The kids were

lying there and
they were so still.

And I knew they
were going away,

and I knew they needed me to take care of them,
so I went with them.

And then...


And then...

I found those flowers,
and I was painting the front hall

and it was snowing,
and I was worried

you wouldn't make it
home, but you did.

What else?
What else do you remember?

I don't remember anything.


I don't remember anything.

You shot me.
You shot me.

No.
You shot me!

No, I shot the man
who shot the girls.

You shot me.

No. (GASPS)

What is that?

It's a scar.

Why?

Forgive me.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

ANN: Peter?
Peter, are you there?

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

Peter?

You have to get
out of here. What?

You're gonna
tell me the truth.

ANN: I tried to tell
you in Greenhaven.

WILL: Tell me what?

Everything.

Libby, the children,
they're gone.

Libby is dead,

and you need
to let them go.

It was a mistake
coming back here.

You can't stay in
this house, Peter.

It'll drive you crazy.

How did she die, Ann?

Tell me how she died.

Libby loved you.

She'd want you
to let her go.

You have to let
her go now, Peter.

Hey. Where are you?

I heard you come in.
Is that you downstairs?

WILL: I'm outside the house.

LIBBY: Uh-huh.

DEE DEE: Daddy's home.

Who are you?

Shh!

Mommy? LIBBY: Come on,
I heard you downstairs.

What? You're a liar.
What?

WILL ON PHONE: Libby?

Okay, kids, don't move,
don't move.

Mommy?
LIBBY: It's gonna be okay.

Libby?

Put down the gun, please.

Libby?

LIBBY ON PHONE:
Put the gun down, please.

Libby!

Run!
Daddy!


(GUN FIRING)


(LIBBY GASPING)


WILL: I didn't do it.

I didn't.

(DOOR CREAKING)

Hello, Peter Ward.

Jack?

Why don't you...

Why don't you put
that thing down

and we can have
a conversation?



Peter!

ANN: Jack, you killed them.

JACK: It was supposed
to be you.

(FISTS POUNDING)

Stop!


Get the chloroform! Now!


JACK: It should've
been so simple.

BOYCE: I went to the wrong goddamn house.
It was a mistake.

JACK: We put them
in the basement.

(OPENS DOOR)

(BELLS TINKLING)

Where are you?

BOYCE ON PHONE:
I'm pulling up right now.

First right on Bramble Branch,
third house on the right.

I'm outside the house.
I'm looking at Jack's wife right now.

Where is she?

She's talking to
someone on her cell.

Who's she talking to?

I don't know.

Maybe that young boyfriend
you were talking about.

JACK ON PHONE:
You got the gun I gave you last night?

BOYCE ON PHONE: Yeah.

Well, use it.

And then just drift on out of New Ashford like I told you.

The insurance money
is real, right?

You'll get paid.

I know we don't know each other that well,
but after tonight

you got something on me,
I got something on you.

We gotta trust
each other.

You sure you want
me to do this?

What right has she got
to destroy my life?

What right has she
got to my daughter?

Your call. Last chance
to back out of this.

Kill her now.


(GUN FIRES)

I'm sick of
your shit.

You've tormented me
for five goddamn years.

Child killer.

(GUN FIRES)


Come on.

You'll never collect.

Chloe collects,
I collect.

(BELLS TINKLING)

(DOOR CREAKING)

You took everything.
My money, my house, my kid!

And now that Ward's back,

I get another shot.




Peter.


Peter?

Peter! Wake up, Peter!


Okay, Ward!


ANN: Peter. Peter.

You're all right.
You're all right. You're okay.

(GUN FIRING)




(ANN COUGHING)

Are you okay?

Yes.
Chloe!

CHLOE: Mom! Mom!

Oh, baby.

Peter, no!

Libby! Libby!


What are you doing?
Get out of here.

I don't wanna lose you.

I know,
but you have to go.

You be good.

We love you, Daddy.

I love you.

I love you.

I'll always be with you.

I know.

But you know that.


(SIREN WAILING)

Is there anybody
else inside?

No.

You okay?
Yeah.
