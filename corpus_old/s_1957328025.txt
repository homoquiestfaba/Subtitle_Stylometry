How are you?

People, I can't hear you.

That's too loud.

Thanks for coming out tonight.

My name is Tig Notaro, and--

No, no, no, no, no.

Let's-- let's relax.
Um...

Who wants to hear
a story about Kool-Aid?

It's about the Kool-Aid Man.

<i>And, um--</i>

I don't know if the commercials
still are on TV. I have no idea.

Has anyone seen
a Kool-Aid commercial?

Oh, yeah.
I am not--oh, yeah.

I just found part of my dinner
in my mouth and chewed it.

Yeah, I don't know if the Kool-Aid Man
is on commercials anymore.

I don't care about
if my material is relevant.

I do "Sanford and Son" jokes.

I do whatever feels right.

Does anyone-- is anyone not
familiar with the Kool-Aid Man?

Everyone.

Tig, are you kidding me?
Everyone.

I bet there is somebody
out there that's like,

"Who's the Kool-Aid Man?"

The Kool-Aid Man is a pitcher.

No real clear indication
that he's a man, but--

<i>has kind of a rounded bottom.</i>

<i>But somehow he's for sure a man.</i>

He, I guess, is aware
when people buy Kool-Aid.

<i>Kicks down walls.</i>

Right now,
the person that didn't know

who the Kool-Aid Man is like...

"What?"

Yeah, be careful.
He is out there.

Just to sidetrack here a little,
it reminds me of--

I had this job.
I worked with children.

<i>And there was this woman</i>
<i>that annoyed me to no end.</i>

<i>And when I was cleaning up,</i>
<i>sweeping, she was talking to me.</i>

<i>And I rarely paid attention</i>
<i>to what she said.</i>

<i>And this was so long ago.</i>

<i>And she was, like, going on and on</i>

<i>about dinosaurs and how they were,</i>
<i>you know, eating people.</i>

<i>And I was like, "Wait, what?</i>

<i>Why are we just</i>
<i>standing here?"</i>

<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, like, scientists,</i>

<i>you know, took an insect</i>
<i>and took the blood, and--"</i>

<i>And I was like, "And they're just</i>
<i>running around eating people?"</i>

<i>And she's like, "Yes, I can't believe</i>
<i>you haven't heard about this."</i>

<i>Had no idea it was</i>
<i>"Jurassic Park."</i>

What does that have to do
with the Kool-Aid Man?

I don't even-- I can't even
follow myself here.

<i>Guys, have you seen</i>
<i>the Kool-Aid Man?</i>

<i>He has a round bottom</i>

<i>and a front bottom--</i>
<i>a round, front bottom.</i>

<i>He knows if you've had Kool-Aid.</i>

Kicks walls down,
busts through walls, fences.

You can't just have Kool-Aid.

Oh, I know where
my train of thought was.

I just saw it right there.

This guy was like, "Ah!"

"Ah! Get on with it!"

No.

The Kool-Aid Man
with his round bottom.

You can't just be hanging out
having Kool-Aid.

This guy is coming at you.

Wh-- is he dangerous?
Is he violent?

What is happening?

<i>It's weird enough</i>
<i>for the person who's having</i>

<i>the Kool-Aid</i>
<i>to have the Kool-Aid Man...</i>

<i>End up in their backyard.</i>

<i>That's a weird,</i>
<i>very uncomfortable day.</i>

That sounded like somebody
trying out a new laugh tonight.

Just like,
"I think I'm gonna do it now."

And their friend is like...

"Well, that's a new laugh."

"What? I thought
I'd try it out tonight.

I thought I'd blend in."

"No, you did not."

"When I did it in the car

"on the way,

it felt more natural."

Feel free to try and wedge it in
any other point.

So that's a-- that's an odd day

to be in your backyard,
Kool-Aid Man showing up

with a little rounded bottom
and front bottom.

But think about,
more importantly,

if he's busting through a fence,

that means he was waiting...

<i>In their neighbor's yard...</i>

<i>For God only knows how long.</i>

And even before that was like,

<i>walking through the neighborhood,</i>

you know, just sensing
that somebody got Kool-Aid,

<i>and then coming in the side gate,</i>

<i>waiting on the other-- he was just--</i>

<i>the whole time, nobody really</i>
<i>considers he was waiting</i>

<i>in the neighbor's yard</i>
<i>all that time.</i>

<i>And...</i>

<i>the neighbor is like,</i>

<i>in their kitchen</i>
<i>having breakfast or lunch</i>

<i>and there's just, like,</i>
<i>a little pitcher with a couple of legs.</i>

And then who yells "Kool-Aid?"

Doesn't somebody yell
"Kool-Aid?"

What?

They go, "Hey, Kool-Aid."
And he goes, "Oh, yeah!"

Do you do voice-over?

Are they saying it like,
"Hey, Kool-Aid!"

Like they're happy
that they're having Kool-Aid?

No, like, "You're gonna pay
for that brick wall."

Like, "Pay me."

No, I think that happens before--

then he's like, "Oh, yeah,"

and then he busts down the wall.

Do you under-- do you understand?

We found the person not
familiar with the Kool-Aid Man.

Ah, we caught ya!

I dated somebody years ago,

and I realized

<i>that I was more into them</i>

<i>than they were into me.</i>

<i>And the way I knew this was--</i>

<i>I had to get</i>
<i>all four of my wisdom teeth</i>

<i>surgically removed.</i>

<i>And when you have it done,</i>

<i>they need you to have somebody</i>
<i>drive you there,</i>

<i>sign you in, and sign you out,</i>

<i>agreeing to drive you.</i>

<i>And I asked her</i>

<i>if she could drive me...</i>

<i>to the hospital.</i>

<i>She said that she could not.</i>

<i>The crazy part also being</i>

<i>that, um, she was self-employed.</i>

<i>And I was like, "Really?</i>

<i>"You-- you can't ask</i>
<i>the boss man for this one--</i>

<i>this one favor?"</i>

<i>And then I said,</i>
<i>"Oh, here's an idea.</i>

<i>How about you follow me</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

<i>and I'll park my car.</i>

<i>You sign me in,</i>
<i>and then you can just leave.</i>

<i>I'll get the procedure done,</i>
<i>and then I'll just drive myself home."</i>

<i>And she said, "I can do that."</i>

<i>In that moment, I was like, oh,</i>

<i>I like her more than she likes me.</i>

It's confirmed.

<i>So she signed me in</i>
<i>and went off to work.</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

<i>More than I love myself, apparently.</i>

<i>So I get my wisdom teeth</i>
<i>surgically removed.</i>

<i>And when they're moving me</i>
<i>to just kind of recuperate</i>

<i>in this room, I kind of</i>
<i>woke up and realized,</i>

<i>"Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>There's nobody here</i>
<i>to drive me home."</i>

<i>And as soon as the nurses</i>
<i>left the room,</i>

<i>I jumped up</i>
<i>and just started hauling ass</i>

<i>down the hall of the hospital,</i>

<i>all crooked, slamming into walls.</i>

<i>And, uh, I got out to my car,</i>

<i>started it up...</i>

<i>Drove off,</i>

<i>and I was awoken,</i>

<i>when I rear-ended</i>
<i>a car in front of me.</i>

<i>It wasn't really bad.</i>

<i>It was just-- I think I just</i>
<i>fell asleep at a light,</i>

<i>and my foot slid off the brake,</i>

<i>and I just rolled</i>
<i>into the car in front of me.</i>

<i>And the guy jumped out</i>
<i>of his car and was beating</i>

<i>on my window, like,</i>
<i>"What is your problem?"</i>

<i>And I was like, "I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Sorry about that."</i>

<i>There was no damage.</i>
<i>Everything was fine.</i>

<i>And so I continued on.</i>

<i>And when I finally got home,</i>

<i>I was in so much pain that I needed</i>

<i>to get back to the hospital.</i>

<i>I hadn't stopped at the pharmacy</i>
<i>to get pain medication,</i>

<i>so I just had four</i>
<i>gaping holes in my mouth,</i>

<i>and I realized there was no way</i>

<i>that I was gonna be able</i>
<i>to get back to the hospital.</i>

<i>So I went over to my neighbor</i>
<i>and friend Leslie's apartment,</i>

<i>and I knocked on her door.</i>

<i>"Leslie!</i>

<i>Leslie!"</i>

<i>No response.</i>

<i>And in my crazy, drugged-up head,</i>

<i>I had made up the story</i>
<i>that Leslie was in there</i>

<i>and she knew I was in pain</i>

<i>and she was just refusing</i>
<i>to help me.</i>

<i>So I got down.</i>

<i>"Leslie!</i>

<i>"Leslie!</i>

<i>Leslie."</i>

<i>I didn't see her.</i>

<i>So I got up, and then I went around</i>

<i>to the front of the apartment.</i>

<i>And one of the other tenants</i>

<i>was in a bikini, sun tanning.</i>

<i>And I come around the corner,</i>

<i>and she's like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God!"</i>

<i>And I said, " Hi.</i>

<i>"Have you...</i>

<i>seen... Leslie?"</i>

<i>"No."</i>

<i>"Okay.</i>

<i>"Well, if you</i>

<i>"do see Leslie,</i>

<i>"can you tell her that</i>

<i>Tig needs to go</i>
<i>to the hospital?"</i>

<i>"Yes."</i>

<i>"Thank you so much.</i>

<i>"Leslie!</i>

<i>Leslie!"</i>

<i>Just stood next to this woman</i>
<i>in a bikini</i>

<i>throwing pebbles to Leslie's</i>
<i>second floor window.</i>

<i>No response.</i>

<i>So I was like, "You know what?</i>

<i>I'm gonna go ahead</i>
<i>and go back around,</i>

<i>try the door again."</i>

<i>So I went back over up the stairs.</i>

<i>However, this time,</i>

<i>there was a trail of fresh blood</i>

<i>leading to Leslie's door,</i>

<i>with a little pool at her door.</i>

<i>And I was like, "Oh, no!</i>

<i>Leslie! Leslie!"</i>

<i>This time, she opened the door.</i>

<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Are you okay?"</i>

<i>That was my blood.</i>

<i>My face was so numb</i>

<i>that I did not realize</i>

<i>that...</i>

<i>I had blood</i>

<i>pouring out of my mouth,</i>

<i>down my shirt.</i>

<i>So if we can for a moment</i>

<i>go back to the woman sunbathing.</i>

<i>How did she not have</i>
<i>a single question for me?</i>

<i>'Cause, I mean,</i>
<i>I am essentially just</i>

<i>pouring blood out of my mouth like,</i>

<i>"Hey, if you see Leslie,</i>

<i>can you tell her that I need</i>
<i>to go to the hospital?"</i>

<i>And she's just like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, absolutely.</i>

<i>I'll let her know."</i>

<i>Not one question.</i>

<i>Like, how about,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God, what happened?"</i>

<i>Or, "Can I take you</i>
<i>to the hospital?"</i>

<i>What is her problem?</i>

<i>I mean, you know, to be fair,</i>

<i>maybe she also was self-employed</i>

<i>and, you know,</i>

<i>was unable to help me out.</i>

My friend that I grew up with--
her mother gave her a car.

And she had to drive it
to Los Angeles

and asked if I would go with her.

And so we hit the road

<i>and filled up on Funyuns</i>
<i>and what have you.</i>

<i>And then she said,</i>

<i>"I feel like I have an aunt</i>
<i>in West Texas somewhere,</i>

<i>and we'll go crash</i>
<i>at her place."</i>

<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Sure."</i>

<i>So we pull up to this woman.</i>

<i>I don't remember her name.</i>
<i>Great-Great Aunt Myrtle.</i>

<i>She's like the a-- Yoda--</i>

<i>grew up with Yoda.</i>

<i>I don't think anybody</i>
<i>has ever visited this person.</i>

<i>This elderly woman was just</i>
<i>pacing back and forth</i>

waiting for us once--

Oh, my God.

What do you mean, "Oh, my God"?

<i>There was an old woman</i>
<i>pacing at a window.</i>

<i>So excited somebody</i>
<i>was coming to her house.</i>

My apologies.

<i>We park.</i>
<i>We go in.</i>

<i>We are so tired.</i>

<i>We want to go to bed.</i>

<i>Mm-mm.</i>

<i>Guess who has cooked the equivalent</i>

<i>to a Thanksgiving feast.</i>

<i>Great-Great Aunt Myrtle.</i>

<i>And we're like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my gosh, thank you,"</i>

<i>and sat down</i>

<i>and had to eat apple pie</i>

<i>and mashed potatoes</i>

<i>and just so-- creamed corn.</i>

And, you know,
you're probably not gonna like

what I'm about to say.

<i>She was boring.</i>

<i>All of her stories.</i>

<i>Everybody was dead</i>
<i>that she was talking about.</i>

<i>Our eyes were cr-- we were</i>
<i>so, like, "Oh, my gosh,""</i>

<i>having to eat this food,</i>

<i>tortured by her stories.</i>

<i>"Oh, and you think that's bad?</i>

<i>"Well, you know,</i>
<i>and then she'd come down...</i>

<i>"Do go on.</i>
<i>Do go on."</i>

<i>Oh, my God, I'm so tired.</i>

<i>We get up,</i>
<i>we help her do the dishes,</i>

<i>and then she explains</i>
<i>where our rooms are.</i>

<i>"Thank you so much for dinner,</i>
<i>for letting us stay."</i>

<i>We go to the room, and then we hear,</i>

<i>"Ah, ahh!"</i>

"Ahh!"
This old bat had fallen.

<i>We now have to take her</i>
<i>to the emergency room.</i>

<i>We are up all night</i>

<i>at the hospital with this woman.</i>

<i>She was fine.</i>

<i>She just needed a little</i>
<i>tender love and care.</i>

<i>We bring her back home,</i>
<i>drop her off.</i>

<i>It is now tomorrow.</i>

<i>And we need to just</i>
<i>get back on the road.</i>

<i>We're saying our goodbyes.</i>

<i>She did-- they had gotten her</i>
<i>a walker to help her,</i>

<i>you know, with her hip.</i>

<i>And she was like, "Oh, no,</i>
<i>"you're not getting on the road,</i>

<i>not till</i>
<i>I make you breakfast."</i>

<i>We had to sit down</i>

<i>while she pushed</i>

<i>a walker around</i>

<i>and made us a feast of a breakfast.</i>

<i>Never got sleep, got on the road,</i>

<i>saved 40 bucks on a motel room.</i>

<i>We won.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

You guys--I mean, fir--like,

"Oh, not our Aunt Myrtle!"

And then you're like, "

Yeah, pocket that 40 bucks."

<i>There's no way</i>
<i>she's still alive, by the way.</i>

<i>And probably nobody has found her.</i>

"Oh!

Not our Aunt Myrtle!"

Um... I was in--
before Stephanie and I

<i>got married,</i>

before we were even engaged--

"Aww."
Mm-hmm.

It's a very sweet story
that I'm about to tell you.

<i>I was in Philadelphia,</i>
<i>and I had collapsed</i>

<i>after a show from internal bleeding.</i>

<i>And, um...</i>

Whoo!
Thank you.

<i>So, um, I-- luckily,</i>
<i>Stephanie was with me.</i>

<i>And we go-- we go to the hospital.</i>

<i>And when you're bleeding internally,</i>
<i>it is so painful.</i>

<i>It's-- your blood is supposed</i>
<i>to be inside of your veins.</i>

<i>And when it's just</i>
<i>going everywhere, it burns.</i>

<i>And so it was the most pain</i>
<i>I've ever felt in my life.</i>

<i>And I've felt some pain.</i>

And so I was like--
it was this kind of thing.

<i>Very attractive.</i>

<i>And we're not engaged yet.</i>

<i>And I'm--I'm just like--</i>

<i>And I'm-- I'm in the hospital,</i>

<i>and the nurses are lifting me up</i>

<i>to put me on a bedpan.</i>

<i>And, um, I said,</i>

<i>"Is it okay</i>

<i>if I just go everywhere?"</i>

<i>And the nurses were like, "Um...</i>

<i>"Please, no.</i>

<i>"No. We have a bedpan.</i>

<i>That's what--"</i>

<i>But in my drugged mind,</i>
<i>I was just like,</i>

<i>"There's no way you can contain</i>

<i>what I'm about to do."</i>

<i>So I was just like--</i>

<i>"Can I just go on everybody,</i>
<i>just everywhere?"</i>

<i>They were just like, "No."</i>

<i>And so Stephanie was next</i>
<i>to me, and she was just like,</i>

<i>"I love you, I love you,"</i>

<i>as they're putting me on the bedpan.</i>

<i>And I was like--</i>

<i>And then I just thought...</i>

<i>It crossed my mind to be like,</i>

<i>"Will you marry me?"</i>

<i>Even though I was in so much pain</i>

<i>and on so many drugs,</i>
<i>I just thought,</i>

<i>"This would be unbelievable,</i>

<i>"to give her this moment</i>

<i>and to give the nurses</i>
<i>this moment."</i>

<i>I just seemed like the</i>
<i>grossest person in the world.</i>

<i>"Can I use everyone as a toilet?</i>

<i>"And will you...</i>

<i>spend the rest</i>
<i>of your life with me?"</i>

I knew in my drugged-up mind

that it would be so amazing
if people were like,

<i>"Oh, my God, you're engaged.</i>

<i>How did it happen?"</i>

<i>"Well...</i>

<i>"very typical love story.</i>

<i>"Tig was in a diaper.</i>

<i>They took it off."</i>

<i>That weekend together--</i>

<i>we had so many times</i>
<i>where I was like,</i>

<i>"This is the person,"</i>

<i>but that particular time,</i>
<i>I was like,</i>

<i>"We are good, we're all set,"</i>

<i>because I did have</i>
<i>to wear a diaper after that</i>

<i>and I had to have stomach surgery.</i>

<i>And so I was walking about</i>
<i>this fast in a diaper,</i>

<i>just, crinkle, crinkle.</i>

<i>And I couldn't leave Philadelphia.</i>

<i>I had to get a hotel in</i>
<i>Philadelphia to recover there.</i>

<i>So-- but I'm in my little diaper,</i>
<i>crinkle, crinkle,</i>

<i>as I'm moving, and this is</i>
<i>how I knew Stephanie--</i>

<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, she's the one."</i>

<i>She was laughing so hard</i>

<i>and, like, taking pictures</i>
<i>and videos of right here.</i>

<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Okay, fine, fine."</i>

<i>And so I have an entire iPhone</i>

<i>full of just close-ups</i>
<i>of my diapers.</i>

<i>And I just like, "I'm in pain,</i>
<i>but this is funny."</i>

<i>"I'll laugh another time."</i>

Um...

I think I've been hospitalized
six or seven times

in the past six years, and--

Wow.
It's a lot.

Like, my-- my stomach is scarred,

and just tonight I was saying
to Stephanie-- I was like,

<i>"This is hilarious.</i>

<i>You have one here,</i>
<i>one here, one here."</i>

<i>You know, the tits got</i>
<i>yanked off a few years ago,</i>

<i>tossed in a dumpster somewhere,</i>

<i>an alley in Hollywood.</i>

<i>I like to picture</i>
<i>just rodents fighting over...</i>

<i>When people ask, "Where--</i>
<i>where did your boobs go?"</i>

<i>I truly assume</i>
<i>they're just in an alley,</i>

<i>just getting run over.</i>

<i>A doctor cut 'em off,</i>
<i>tossed 'em and out the window.</i>

What else?
Um...

Uh, do you guys know
the comedian Jenny Slate?

<i>I was just curious.</i>

<i>I've known Jenny for years.</i>

<i>She's not, like, my best friend.</i>

<i>But we had each other's numbers,</i>

<i>and she texted me and said,</i>

<i>"Hey, I'm moving to L.A.</i>

<i>Do you want to have tea?"</i>

<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"I'm not feeling very well.</i>

<i>"I've been in bed.</i>

<i>"I should probably be better</i>
<i>in a couple of days.</i>

<i>Let's get in touch then."</i>

<i>Jenny said, "Feel better."</i>
<i>She texted me in a couple of days.</i>

<i>"How you feeling, Tig?</i>
<i>Wanna have tea?"</i>

<i>"Jenny, turns out</i>
<i>I have pneumonia now.</i>

<i>"I can't have tea, but, uh,</i>

<i>when I'm feeling better,</i>
<i>absolutely, we'll grab tea."</i>

<i>Jenny texts me,</i>
<i>"How you feeling?"</i>

<i>"Oh, my gosh, Jenny.</i>
<i>I'm in the hospital.</i>

<i>"Uh, I have developed a disease.</i>

<i>"It's eating my digestive tract.</i>

<i>I can't have tea."</i>

<i>And she was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God."</i>

<i>And she said, "I'm going to Boston</i>
<i>"to get married this weekend.</i>

<i>I will check back in with you</i>
<i>when I'm back."</i>

<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, well, congrats."</i>

<i>I mean, I wasn't even invited</i>
<i>to her wedding, you know?</i>

<i>But, like, she's moving to L.A.</i>
<i>She wants to grab coffee. Sure.</i>

<i>She gets back to town,</i>

<i>and she's like, "Hey,</i>
<i>just seeing how you're doing."</i>

<i>"Jenny, I am now</i>
<i>out of the hospital,</i>

<i>"but my mother has had</i>
<i>a terrible accident,</i>

<i>and I have to go take her off</i>
<i>life support."</i>

<i>She's like, "Oh, my God."</i>

<i>"Yeah, I am so sorr--</i>
<i>I ju-- I'm sorry. Um...</i>

<i>Sorry for the inconvenience."</i>

<i>But, like, poor Jenny Slate.</i>

<i>I mean, okay,</i>
<i>I'm sure there were, like,</i>

<i>20 people that she was like,</i>

<i>"Hey, I'm moving to town.</i>
<i>Let's get tea."</i>

<i>She got caught up</i>
<i>in my swirling hell,</i>

<i>and had to keep checking in with me.</i>

<i>And now every ti-- I'm like,</i>

<i>"Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what am I gonna tell Jenny?"</i>

<i>"Jenny, I'm feeling a lot better.</i>

<i>"You know,</i>
<i>I'm gonna come through this.</i>

<i>"We will have our tea,</i>
<i>but I just gotta</i>

<i>to pull myself together a bit."</i>

<i>She checks in again.</i>

<i>And I was like, "Oh...</i>

<i>"my God.</i>

<i>"Jenny,</i>

<i>I have cancer."</i>

<i>And she was just like,</i>
<i>"What is going on?"</i>

<i>Like, every time</i>
<i>she contacted me, I was like--</i>

<i>it got worse and worse</i>
<i>and worse and worse.</i>

<i>Okay, I come through all of this,</i>

<i>and I was on my couch,</i>

<i>in recovery,</i>
<i>emotionally, physically.</i>

<i>Somebody had sent me</i>
<i>a huge bouquet of balloons.</i>

<i>You know, those just, like,</i>
<i>20 balloons kind of bouquet,</i>

<i>and it's like--you know?</i>

<i>Have you seen those?</i>
<i>They're gigantic.</i>

<i>And there was--</i>
<i>somebody had sent that.</i>

<i>It was taking up half of my loft.</i>
<i>It was like "Get well,"</i>

<i>"Feel better," "Hang in there,"</i>

<i>"Oh, my God,"</i>

<i>"Yikes,"</i>

<i>"Hoo, boy."</i>

<i>So Jenny comes over to my loft</i>

<i>to have tea, finally.</i>

<i>And we're sitting there on my couch.</i>

<i>And, um-- and I was just barely</i>
<i>able to move at this point.</i>

<i>And I told Jenny, I said, "You know,</i>

<i>I've been sitting here</i>
<i>looking at these balloons."</i>

<i>I was like, "I want to release</i>

<i>"these balloons out into the world</i>

<i>"with a note that says,</i>
<i>'Hello, my name is Tig Notaro.</i>

<i>'I-- I have cancer,</i>

<i>but I'm--</i>
<i>I'm gonna beat this.'"</i>

<i>And, uh, Jenny's like,</i>
<i>"That is such a great idea.</i>

<i>Let's shove these</i>
<i>out of the window."</i>

<i>And so we open the window.</i>

<i>I'm like--</i>

<i>Pushing, you know.</i>
<i>All these huge balloons.</i>

<i>We're, like,</i>
<i>getting it across the room.</i>

<i>And-- and we push all these balloons</i>

<i>with all these little messages</i>
<i>out of my window.</i>

<i>And it has this little note</i>
<i>attached to it.</i>

<i>And out they went,</i>
<i>and it was this really</i>

<i>kind of freeing moment</i>
<i>that the balloons went out.</i>

<i>And then they immediately</i>
<i>got stuck on the fire escape</i>

<i>of the apartment right above me.</i>

<i>So now the man that lives above me</i>

<i>has just gotten this</i>
<i>outrageous message</i>

<i>from this cancer-riddled person,</i>

<i>just like, "Hey, I have--</i>

<i>"This is what's been</i>
<i>going on down here,</i>

<i>"but I'm doing a lot better.</i>
<i>I'm coming through it."</i>

<i>That's essentially</i>
<i>what he had to deal with</i>

<i>and pull off of his fire escape</i>
<i>and drag into his window,</i>

<i>thinking I was sending him</i>
<i>that message.</i>

<i>And then the awkwardness...</i>

<i>In the lobby and elevator</i>
<i>after that,</i>

<i>just like, "How you doing?</i>

<i>"I'm still doing well.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>How are your balloons?"</i>

This is a very stupid thought
that I had,

and I just have
to share it with you.

Why are they called "pigs"?

Why weren't they just called "bigs"?

Guys, I'm sorry.

They're big.
That's dumb, I know,

but it still crossed my mind.

Oh, my gosh, there's a spider.

So you guys were watching the--

It's coming down.

"It's coming down."

I love that this spider
lives up there

and is just like,

<i>"Who is...</i>

<i>"Who is performing tonight?</i>

<i>Not a fan."</i>

This spider is like, "Oh, I thought that
was Demetri Martin, but--"

I mean, he's hauling ass right now.

So you guys were watching
a spider come down,

and you didn't tell me.

We didn't wanna interrupt.
Didn't want to interrupt?

There was a spider
coming down.

Let me put it this way.

If there's ever a spider

coming down on top of me

during my show

when I'm talking about all
the deadly diseases I had...

Interrupt my show.

I don't want
to be bitten by a spider

'cause God knows Jenny Slate
is gonna wanna have tea.

I was so into Van Halen as a kid.

<i>And, um, like,</i>
<i>I loved Eddie Van Halen.</i>

<i>I just--to this day,</i>
<i>I still just really enjoy him.</i>

<i>Any time he played guitar,</i>
<i>I was just like,</i>

<i>"Oh, my gosh."</i>
<i>And I played soccer.</i>

<i>And I would be outside</i>
<i>just juggling the soccer ball</i>

<i>for hours, just going at it.</i>

<i>And there was-- there</i>
<i>was woods right by my house.</i>

<i>I would make up that Eddie Van Halen</i>

<i>heard I was out</i>
<i>juggling the soccer ball</i>

<i>and, uh,</i>

<i>would just appear out of the woods,</i>

<i>not to where</i>
<i>I could totally see him,</i>

<i>but he'd lean against a tree.</i>

<i>And just in my head, he was like,</i>

<i>"You're doing</i>
<i>a great job, kid."</i>

So that means that Van Halen
was on their tour bus...

<i>Driving along,</i>
<i>and Eddie was just like,</i>

<i>"Guys, there's this little girl</i>

<i>"in Spring, Texas,</i>

<i>"juggling a soccer ball</i>

<i>"for hours on end.</i>

<i>"We need to pull off the route here</i>

<i>and swing by, and I just need</i>
<i>to check how she's doing."</i>

<i>And there he was, every time</i>
<i>I juggled a soccer ball.</i>

<i>I never looked 'cause I didn't</i>
<i>wanna scare him away.</i>

<i>I was just like, "I know</i>
<i>you're back there, Eddie.</i>

<i>I know you think I'm great."</i>

All right, that's not worth sharing.

You don't have
to share everything, Tig.

I was thinking about my life

<i>and how I identify with being cool.</i>

I am a cool person.

That is what gets me through,
is being cool.

<i>I smoked from the time</i>
<i>I was, like, four</i>

<i>until I was 25.</i>

<i>So, you know, that's kinda tough.</i>

<i>And I kind of had this total</i>
<i>Fonzarelli vibe about me.</i>

<i>But as a kid,</i>
<i>in many times in my life,</i>

<i>I have blown my cool,</i>

<i>where I'm just, like, out there</i>

<i>trying to be</i>
<i>an interesting little person,</i>

<i>and then, boom, blow my cool.</i>

<i>My friend lived on a farm,</i>

<i>and she asked me</i>
<i>if I wanted to come over</i>

<i>and ride motorcycles</i>
<i>out in the pasture with her.</i>

<i>"Uh, yeah.</i>

<i>"If I'm not doing it at your place,</i>
<i>I'm doing it at mine."</i>

<i>I have seen people ride motorcycles.</i>

<i>It's not that hard.</i>

<i>Yeah, I'll be over</i>
<i>to ride motorcycles</i>

<i>through your pasture.</i>

<i>I got over to her house,</i>

<i>and they were just, like,</i>
<i>little tiny motorcycles.</i>

<i>And in my head,</i>

<i>before I got over there,</i>
<i>it was like,</i>

<i>"Yeah, I know how to ride</i>
<i>a motorcycle."</i>

<i>And then as I was getting</i>
<i>closer to it, I was thinking,</i>

<i>"Oh, my God, I don't know</i>
<i>how to ride a motorcycle."</i>

<i>And it was just a minibike,</i>

<i>which wasn't as complicated,</i>
<i>I guess,</i>

<i>but I put it in gear</i>

<i>and gunned it.</i>

<i>And you know that reckless,</i>
<i>horrible feeling</i>

<i>where you're going over</i>
<i>a bump and into a hole</i>

<i>and over a bump and</i>
<i>there is no control over it?</i>

<i>And then I slammed into the fence.</i>

<i>And I was in so much pain.</i>

<i>But I was so cool</i>

<i>that I couldn't even reveal</i>

<i>that I wanted my mommy.</i>

<i>Fonzarelli wanted her mommy.</i>

<i>I was just like, "Ohh."</i>

<i>And I was still</i>
<i>regularly wetting my pants</i>

<i>at that point in my life.</i>

<i>Blowing my cool constantly.</i>

<i>Just a horseshoe of urine</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

<i>"I don't have time</i>
<i>to use a toilet."</i>

<i>I am riding motorcycles</i>

<i>through pastures--</i>

<i>horseshoe of urine.</i>

<i>Do you know what I would do</i>
<i>to cover that up?</i>

<i>I'd go sit in a puddle.</i>

<i>Really, I-- the world was my toilet.</i>

<i>Anything was fine.</i>

<i>A bed?</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

<i>A friend spent the night.</i>
<i>I woke up.</i>

<i>They were covered in my urine,</i>

<i>sleeping like a baby.</i>

<i>I woke up my friend.</i>
<i>I was like, "I am so sorry.</i>

<i>"My cat...</i>

<i>"She always does this.</i>

<i>This is gross.</i>
<i>This is gross."</i>

<i>There was another time</i>
<i>I blew my cool.</i>

<i>I play guitar.</i>

<i>And I was kinda known in my school</i>

<i>for being pretty amazing</i>

<i>even though nobody had seen me play.</i>

<i>And there was a talent show,</i>

<i>and this girl asked me if</i>
<i>I would play a song with her.</i>

<i>And, uh, I was like,</i>
<i>"Yeah.</i>

<i>You came to the right one."</i>

<i>So we rehearsed, I guess,</i>
<i>one time at her house,</i>

<i>and I can't really remember</i>
<i>what that was like.</i>

<i>I don't imagine it went that well</i>

<i>because show day,</i>
<i>we were introduced,</i>

<i>we come out onstage,</i>

<i>she's playing piano,</i>
<i>and she's singing,</i>

<i>and I'm up there,</i>
<i>you know, in my head.</i>

<i>I was just Eddie Van Halen.</i>

<i>About three strums in,</i>

<i>I forgot all of the chords.</i>

<i>There was even a guitar solo</i>
<i>I was supposed to go into,</i>

<i>and none of that happened.</i>

<i>So at the talent show,</i>

<i>it was just the girl playing piano</i>

<i>and me standing there</i>

<i>with my guitar on...</i>

<i>For four minutes.</i>

<i>It went absolutely nowhere,</i>

<i>and I remember her</i>
<i>looking back at me like,</i>

<i>"You know,</i>
<i>you can pick up anywhere."</i>

<i>"Mm-mm.</i>

<i>"No, I cannot.</i>

<i>I'll just stand here while</i>
<i>you finish out the song."</i>

<i>Just a guitar</i>

<i>right there around my neck.</i>

<i>I mean, I'm sure</i>
<i>it went around my back,</i>

<i>not, like, around my neck</i>
<i>like a complete nerd.</i>

The worst day of my life.

Let's end with a fun story,
shall we?

<i>No way.</i>

<i>I went-- I went on the road,</i>

<i>on tour, a few years ago</i>
<i>with some friends of mine.</i>

<i>And we brought--</i>

<i>you know, it was--</i>
<i>it was a few years ago.</i>

<i>We brought our favorite CDs, and--</i>

<i>does that ever happen anymore?</i>

Well, I brought
Dolly Parton's "Greatest Hits."

Yeah. That's right.

<i>She is beyond a national treasure.</i>
<i>She's an international treasure.</i>

<i>She's just a precious person.</i>

And, I mean, who-- it's like,
who doesn't like Dolly Parton?

Every now and then-- okay.
Who doesn't like Dolly Parton?

Clap if you don't like Dolly Parton.

Okay, psychopath right there.

That's the only answer.
To not like Dolly Parton,

it's just like there's
a psychopath in the room.

<i>So we're listening</i>
<i>to Dolly Parton's "Greatest Hits."</i>

<i>Then this song--</i>

<i>one of her songs is called,</i>
<i>"Three Doors Down."</i>

<i>It's so good.</i>

<i>It is so Dolly, okay?</i>

<i>It is the Dolly</i>
<i>we know and love, okay?</i>

Did I say "Three Doors Down"?
Yeah.

That's not a Dolly Parton song.

I think that's a band.

"Two Doors Down." Dolly Parton's song
is "Two Doors Down."

I promise I'm a fan of hers.

<i>It's really, really a great song.</i>
<i>And I asked my friends,</i>

<i>I said, "Hey, do you mind if we listen</i>
<i>to that song again?"</i>

<i>And they're like, "Okay."</i>
<i>They play it.</i>

<i>And then I was like,</i>
<i>"You know what?"</i>

<i>And they kind of</i>
<i>came around to it, like,</i>

<i>"Yeah, this is a really good song.</i>
<i>It's so fun."</i>

<i>And so I just said, "Why don't</i>
<i>we just put it on repeat?"</i>

<i>So we did, and we must've listened</i>
<i>to it, like, 30 times.</i>

All right, let me tell this
story from the beginning.

<i>I'm flying down the road with</i>
<i>my friends Martha and Steve.</i>

<i>We're listening to the song</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

<i>We were smiling.</i>
<i>We were glad.</i>

<i>We were having a blast.</i>

<i>You haven't seen a happier group.</i>

<i>And then...</i>

<i>There's this part of the song</i>

<i>where the-- the song slows down a bit</i>
<i>and hits a minor key.</i>

<i>And I started to imagine a reality</i>

<i>where things maybe</i>
<i>weren't so fun anymore.</i>

<i>I started to imagine we were</i>
<i>losing control of the car,</i>

<i>just sliding off the road.</i>

<i>The car starts</i>
<i>flipping sideways, longways.</i>

<i>The car's upside down.</i>

<i>Then, in this alternative reality,</i>
<i>we come to a crashing halt,</i>

<i>all three of us</i>
<i>gurgling on our own blood,</i>

<i>watching each other die</i>
<i>slow, painful, imaginary deaths.</i>

<i>But if you remember, it's on repeat.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>
