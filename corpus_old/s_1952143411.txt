Baby,
give me some chewing gum.

I don't have any.

You're gonna deny me some chewing gum?
Give me some.

You went through my purse.
What?

You went through my purse.
When?

I hate it when you go through my things.

If you have nothing to hide,
that shouldn't worry you.

I'm not hiding anything.

But I've told you a thousand times,
stop invading my privacy.

I didn't go through your things!
When I asked you for gum...

I did it thinking that perhaps
you had bought some at the store.

And why would I buy gum when
you know I don't like gum!

You don't, but I do.
You could've bought some for me.

Enough, all right?
Just let me read my newspaper in peace!

If you don't like gum...

then what's that pack of gum
doing in your purse?

Let that be the last time you
go through my things!

Fine, I went through your things,
but you lied about the gum.

You have no right to go through my things!
You hear me? No right!

I recognize that I made a mistake.
Now you recognize that you lied about the gum.

I don't have to recognize anything.
Don't go through my things!

If you have nothing to hide, it shouldn't
concern you if I go through your things.

I have a right to privacy!
I don't have to tell you everything!

Why didn't you tell me about the gum?

If I feel like having a thousand packs
of gum in my purse, that's my problem!

And I don't wanna talk about this anymore!
I'm done arguing!

I just want to read the newspaper!
Why do you always have to upset me so?

I don't mean to upset you.
You're free to do whatever you want.

You can have all the gum you want in your
purse. That's not the point.

The point is, you were hiding it from me!

The point is, I don't want to talk about
this anymore! You drive me insane!

Stop annoying me!

I just lost 50 cents in a
newspaper I never got to read!

It's all your fault!
50 cents.

You can read tomorrow's paper.
I'm tired of listening to you.

I'll buy you three.
You're so unfair!

You're the one that's unfair.
All I want to know...

You're pissing me off!
Why can't you come clean?

Please come back, baby.
Why are you always doing this to me?

Come here.

Get that. It could be an emergency.

The woman's already dead. What else could
happen to her?

Ismael, please.

No one there. How does this work?

See who called, Ismaelito.

Grandma's house.
I told you.

Stop busting my balls. We're on our way.

Want me to call them?
Yes, please.

Hello. Who's this?
Tati. Who's this?

Tati, it's me, Ismaelito.

Give me that. Give me that. Hello, Tati?

Lourdes?
Oh, Tati!

I can't believe grandma's gone!

And Mom? Oh, Lord. She must be a wreck.

And I'm not there with her.

Yes, baby, we're on our way there.

So hard. This hit us so hard.

Ismaelito hasn't stopped crying. You know
how he loved his grandma.

He's gotta come with us!
He's gotta come with us!

I'm pregnant!

We're on our way.

Well, hurry up. Your mom's been asking
about you.

Big kiss.

Mercedes! Why did you leave us, Mercedes!

Christ Almighty, please
accept her in your bosom.

Good morning.

Good morning, ma'am.

Good morning. The gentleman cannot stand
there.

I love you.
What?

I love you.

Thanks. But really, you can't stand there.
You have to sit down.

You want me to sit down?

Sit down? I tell you that I love
you and you tell me to sit down?

Passengers cannot cross that line.

And you're crossing it.

Why do you talk to me as if you
didn't know me?

Because I don't know you, sir.
Of course you do.

I don't have time for your little games.
So sit down or get down.

I love you.

So what?

So I'm not leaving until we agree.

Agree to what?

I want to marry you.

And I'm not leaving until you say yes.

Then I'm gonna have to call the cops.

You can't do that! I'm telling you that
I love you and you're gonna call the cops?

What's going on, man?
None of your business.

Thank you, sir. Please sit down.

This is between us.
What is?

What we talked about.
What did we talk about?

That you're gonna marry me.
This guy's nuts.

I don't know him.
He's nuts. Get off my bus!

I asked the Virgin.
The Virgin?

Who are you to come and ruin my day?
Get off my bus!

I love you.
And I don't care, sir!

Buy yourself a dog.
I don't even know you! Get out!

Aren't you listening?
She doesn't love you.

Shut up!

Now you've done it.
Why don't you try that with me?

Don't. You don't know me.
You don't know me, either.

If you're gonna fight, take it outside.

Can't you see he's reckless?
Just get off the bus!

Violence is not the answer.

Don't make me kick you all off the bus.

Tell him to get off!
Yeah, get off the damn bus.

What are you gonna do about it?
Sit down or I'll sit you down.

Calm down. I'll take care of this.
Calm down.

Leave.
No.

Get out. Get out. Get out!

Easy. Calm down.
Don't touch me!

What are you looking at?
Sit down right now!

I dare you to cross that line again.
I dare you.

Cirilo looks good.

You're really something else.
I didn't come here to argue.

I just love it when someone comes
here and tells me what to do.

Mi father's homeless.
And what do you want me to do about it?

Well, this house also belongs to him.

Sorry. Do you know where
my suppositories are?

Cirilo, remember that last night
you used the last one?

True.

This house stopped
being your father's over 30 years ago.

The same day he decided to leave us.

What will Cirilo say if I bring an
old man to live with us?

Mi father is not an old man. He's the
father of your children and he's sick.

Doesn't it make you sad that he's
sleeping in the street?

If it makes you so sad, then why
don't you take him to live with you?

That's insane. You know our
house is barely big enough for us.

Look, Mom, if I'm here it's because
there's no other way out.

Flora. Excuse me.

I can't find my high
blood pressure pills.

They're in the bedroom, Cirilo, in the
nightstand drawer.

Your father was always very selfish.

And what's happening to him is
what he deserves!

Mom, you're no one to judge him.

When Dad left, you went out
with several men.

So?
So that's not right.

Look, sweetie, this is my pussy...

and I'll do with it what I want.

Do you know where the enema is?

Why the hell do you want all that stuff?
What are you making, a rocket?

It's just that I don't feel well.

I don't know. Maybe it's hanging
in the bathroom.

Think about it. It's time to forget
about the past.

Mi dad's all alone.

And he's dying.

And you haven't stopped to think...

that we're all on the way out!

What are you doing?

Had I known you were coming here,
I would've told you to leave me at Grandma's!

I won't take long.
I have to go to the bathroom.

And you can't wait five minutes
to get to her house?

You know I don't like shitting in
someone else's bathroom.

For once in your life, can't you stop
thinking only of yourself?

I'm shitting my pants!
Then hold it!

Then start walking!

Please hurry.
I'll be right back.

What are you doing?
Getting out.

No.
Mom, please...

No.
To stretch my legs!

I said no, Ismaelito. I have enough
problems with your dad.

Be right back.
Hurry up, please.

Ismael!
Macho!

Hey! What's going on?

How are things?

What's going on? Someone die?

That brother of yours is so thoughtless.

You heard?

They just called me.

No, my sister-in-law, don't.
Don't get like that. Don't worry.

Those things happen.

No, no, no.

I'll be honest with you.
Because I might be ugly, but I'm honest.

You shouldn't be crying
over such nonsense.

What do you mean "nonsense"?

Because it's nonsense.

I tell you, I knew it
would end up like this.

Problem here is that...

...that brother of mine was sold
a pig in a poke.

What?

You shouldn't be suffering
because of that woman.

If you stop an think about it,
Tati is a real bitch.

I'm coming!

What?
Mom, can I...

Ismaelito, shut up.

What are you saying?

That you shouldn't be suffering.
Let it go.

I'm coming!

Mom...
Ismaelito!

Wait, Macho, what are you trying to say?

I told Ismael...

not to get involved with that woman
because sooner or later you'd find out.

Goddamnit.
Give me that.

You blow that fucking horn again
and I'll beat the crap out of you!

Are you telling me that my husband
is having an affair with my cousin?

No.

Since when have you known?
No, I didn't...

Since when have you known?

Since they started going out, about six
months ago.

Six months?
Or eight months, I don't know.

Eight months!
What does it matter?

What's important here is that you
don't let this affect you.

That woman is nothing but a cheap whore.

Tatti es nothing but a tramp!
That's what she is!

A piece of shit is what she is.

Get out!
I want to stay in the car!

Get out!

Get out!

Do what your mother says! Goddamnit.

She's shameless.

She's shameless.

What are you doing? Put that gun away.

If you don't marry me, I'll shoot
myself right now.

Are you fucking blind

Fuck! He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

Put that away before you hurt somebody.

Say yes or I shoot myself.
You don't know what you're saying.

Yeah, buddy. Think it over.
We can work it out.

You're very young. Put that away.
Life is too precious.

Without love, life is worthless.

Please, buddy, put that away.
Put it away.

You don't understand.
Of course we understand!

We understand. But certain
things can't be forced.

Marry me, girl. Marry me.

Calm down. Calm down.

We're gonna get these people off the bus.
They have nothing to do with this.

Then you and I will talk.
I'm gonna open the door.

Sounds good. You open the door, we get out,
you guys take care of your business.

Shut up!

No one gets out of here!

Put that down before you shoot someone!
The devil doesn't miss!

Shut up! Next one to open his
mouth gets shot!

Turn it off.

Could you please turn
your cell phones off?

That horn is so annoying.

Who do you think it is?

Mom!

Of course.

Mom!

Mom!

Dad looks good, doesn't he?

Sure does.

Well, I gotta go now, but...

you guys catch up, okay? Bless you.

And I thought I'd never see you again.

That's life for you.

Wait. Let me call Cirilo and...

No, that won't be necessary.

There.

What was that?
What?

Why the wheelchair?
Oh, that.

Your daughter wants me to look
older than I really am.

Unbelievable.

So how have you been, Florita?

Just great. I can't complain.

It's good to see you, Florita.

Tell you the truth,
this soup is delicious!

Thank you. It's Cirilo's recipe.

But it needs a little salt.

You don't like it?
No, I do.

You said it was bland.
I said it's delicious.

It just needs a pinch of salt.

You said it was bland.

Wait here.

I'll go get the salt.

How many years has it been?
Thirty? Forty?

Thirty-five, to be exact.
Unbelievable.

How time flies.

Say when.

No, but it's... That's good. No!

Sorry. I put a little too much.

Look what you've done!

Sorry.

That's all right. I wasn't hungry.

I don't want any more.

My goodness. Look how late it is.

Time to go to sleep.
Cirilo.

Pellín is staying with us tonight.

I hope that's not a problem.

Looks like he didn't like the idea.

Cirilo's like that.
He'll get over it in a second.

Maybe tomorrow.

Here. This makes your problems go away.

Drink it slowly.
Beers don't taste so good in the beginning...

but later... you love them.

Like girls?
No, girls are just the opposite.

In the beginning,
you love them to death...

but later... who can stand them!

Mom.

I'm so happy you're here, baby

This is horrible.
I can't believe she's dead.

And she was so happy!

And when I went to see her this morning,
she was really stiff.

Where's Tati?
Poor thing.

Last night she ate some corn flakes and
asked about you. She was fine!

But where's Tati?
That poor girl.

She really loved your grandma. She's been
running around all day.

The one that doesn't care is Cuchi.

She called saying she couldn't
afford the bus fare.

She's not coming to her
own mother's funeral.

Where's Tati?
How should I know?

Last night I dreamt that Sandra got married,
and then your grandma dies!

That was a premonition.
You want some cheese?

No, thank you, baby. Margarita,
have you seen Tati?

She's in Grandma's room.
I'll be right back.

Yeah, go see her.

...in earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.

Forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou among women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners...

now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Lourdes. Lourdes.

Lourdes!

She came to!

Where am I? What happened?

Baby, you scared us!
Are you all right?

I'm fine. What happened?

You fainted is what happened.
You're paler than a ghost.

This has been so rough on me.
On everyone. You need to rest.

Yes. Leave me alone for a
few minutes, please.

I'll go get you a glass of water.

Tati, baby, please close the door
and stay with me a moment, please.

Baby, wake up. It's seven o'clock.

I know you can hear me, son. Get up.

Last night you left the dog outside.

And I've told you that when the dog's in heat,
she has to sleep inside.

This morning, when I woke up,
I found her stuck to this mutt...

and I had to hit him away with a
stick until he finally let go of her!

I want to wash your sheets and towels.

Doña Tita is coming and I want to
wash them before she gets here.

That woman won't stop talking and when
she comes here, I can't do anything!

Attention, people inside the bus!
Attention! This is the police!

Now we're screwed.

Nobody move! We have you surrounded!

Crap.

I repeat, we have you surrounded!

All I want is to get married.

Back. Everybody back, come on.

We need to talk to you!

Please...

do not harm the passengers!

Look what you've done. It's a mess.
You're gonna have to surrender.

No. Either we get married or
I shoot myself right now.

You wanna shoot yourself?
Then do it and stop bugging me!

How could you say that?

You think I'm not capable of doing it?

I wouldn't marry you if I was dead.

We'll see about that.

We're gonna do this, one way or another.

Back off! Now!

Calm down. Don't do anything stupid.

We want to help you, but you
have to calm down.

Back off or I shoot!

Easy. Easy.

You don't know what I'm capable of!

Easy. No need to get violent.
Calm down. Calm down.

Why are you doing this? What's going on?

We want to get married.
I don't want to marry him!

And if I don't get what I want,
I don't mind dying!

No one's gonna die here.
What is it you want?

A priest. We need a priest to marry us!

A priest.
A priest?

Bring me a priest or everyone dies!

No, no, that's fine.
A priest. Don't worry...

Don't you leave me here with him!
Help me! This guy's crazy!

Why did you bite me?
You beast!

Relax, man. You're a little tense

Do you see this mess?
It's all your fault!

You make me look like the bad guy!
I'm not a bad guy!

I fell in love with you since the first time
I saw you! I don't understand why...

My bad. It was an accident.

Where did that woman go?

To the funeral.
And she couldn't wait a minute?

Dad, if I told you...
What have you done now?

Me? It was you.

For starters, what the hell are
you doing drinking beer?

Let him have a beer. He's an adult.

Your mother couldn't wait?

Your wife left all pissed off because
she found out about Tati.

Come here.

What did you tell her about Tati and me?

Nothing.

I'm going to ask you one more time.
What did you tell her about Tati and me?

Boy, you better patch things up.
You have a huge mess in your hands.

You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

Is that your honey?

You moron! You moron!

Who told you to stick
your nose in my things?

Why did you hit me? What the
fuck is going on here? Hold this.

I hit you because I can!
Now you're gonna get it!

Who told you to stick
your nose in my things!

Come on!

Let go!

What's going on in there? Open this door
right now!

Don't run, honey.

Come here. Come here. Come here.

Come here! Come here!

Enough!
Stop it! Stop it!

Here! Here!
Here! Here! Here!

Give me that! Open this door right now!

Look at me! How dare you do this to me?

You've fucked up my life!
You've fucked up my life!

How dare you do this to me!

You tramp! You fucked up my life!

You fight like a...! You fight like a...!

Double chickenshit. Double chickenshit!

Damn.

You broke my chain, asshole!

The asshole broke my chain!

I was going to pick that up.

Don't worry.
And Pellín?

Outside, taking a shower.

I can't believe it, Flora.
Can't you see we have guests?

You could've worn something
a little more... decent.

But, Cirilo, take a look. This robe is
down to my ankles.

When women are 70, walking around in
their robes is like... wearing panties.

Cirilo, please, don't exaggerate.

Good Lord!

That's my towel.

Florita gave it to me.
Her name is Flora.

I've been calling her Florita for years.

You haven't called her anything in years.

Wait!
What?

You're not planning on getting
dressed before going into the house?

Can't you see I'm dressed?

Look. This is my house!

And you're going to respect me, you hear?

I bought this house some 40 years ago.

Well, okay. But the furniture's all mine.

I bought that.
Maybe the furniture, but not the house.

Cirilo!
Coming!

I'll be watching you.

Watching me? What you should
do is repair that roof.

Every time it rains, you get more wet
with the rain than with the shower.

You hear?

Almost ready.

At least for tonight, you're
going to sleep like a king.

Florita, I mean, having
to sleep in this room.

Don't you have a bedroom to spare?

No. Both bedrooms are taken.

One's mine and the other one's Cirilo's.

Good Lord. You guys don't sleep together?

No. We're no longer married.

No?
No, we're divorced.

Then why does Cirilo...

live with you here, in this house?

Because he needs a little time to
find another house to live in.

A little time. When did you two divorce?

About... 12 years ago.

A little time...

Look, to be really comfortable here...

you have to tuck the sheets like this.

There we go. Just like this.

You're mistaken.
But, Flora, I thought...

What?

That, after all these years, I was
going to spread my legs for you?

And stop looking like an idiot,
or I'll really get mad.

I'm sorry, Florita.

Flori, haven't you stopped to think...

...that we're all on the way out?

Yes. Go to sleep.

Basically, the bus skidded and I stopped
because I thought the driver was nuts.

And when I respectfully went to
ask the driver what was going on...

I see this crazy-looking guy
with a gun this big.

I was the first one here.

You, come here. Yeah, you.

Turn around.

You. Come here.

Come here! Come here!

Yes?

Is that priest coming?

Yeah, he's on his way.
It's all been arranged.

My patience's running out.
You think this is some kind of game?

Look, I'm trying to help you out here,
but you have to take it easy. Calm down.

Let's do this.
You release the passengers...

You take me for a fool?

If I let them go, I'm fucked. Besides,
I need witnesses for the ceremony.

Captain, we have a clear shot. They're
requesting authorization to proceed.

Request denied.

Do something or something
tragic will happen!

We can get him.
I said, request denied.

What the fuck is wrong with you? Enough!

You think this is an action movie? Do
something or everyone ends up dead!

And now?

We wait.

What happened?

You're kidding me. But what did she say?

No, no, no. She's insane.
What's going on?

Baby! Baby, come here.

Come here. Look...

Everyone's spreading
lies about me and Tati.

You know that none of that is true,
right, baby?

You know that Tati and I haven't done
anything, right?

Who you gonna believe, her or me?

Ismaelito!

That woman's insane.

A big fight broke out between Tati
and your mom at Grandma's house.

This one hit that one, that
one hit this one. A real mess.

They want to see your dad.

Now.

Ismaelito, what's wrong?
Are you listening?

Ismaelito!

Good morning.
Good morning.

What is it? Are you all right?

Better than ever.

Why are you dressed like that?
Like what?

Wearing those pants.
You don't like them?

You look like a teenager.
Thank you.

And Pellín?
Outside, taking a shower.

What's the deal with the shower?

If he keeps on showering like this,
he's gonna wear out.

If he wears out, that's his problem.

Estéban!

What happened?
Nothing!

Pellín! What's going on?
What's happening, Pellín?

What's going on?

Careful. Careful. Wait.

Right there. Right there.

Does it hurt?
No, it stings!

I tell you, that rooster was very unfriendly.
Look what he's done to you.

That damned rooster.

I think that's his way
of showing me his love.

Because there are many ways of
showing one's love.

Even with scratches.

That's what you think?

You know what I think, Florita?

I wish we could turn back the clock...

to that time when you and I had an
almost perfect relationship.

Who says anything about
turning back the clock?

With all the life we have ahead of us!

That's true.

You touch me again and I'll
shove the iodine down your throat!

No, but I'm just...

That damn rooster has disappeared.

Did you check the neighbor's house?
He likes to jump the fence.

Not this time.
I even searched the hillside. Nothing.

Well...
Hey, you.

What did you do to my rooster?
He's disappeared.

He's the one who attacked me.
That's the truth.

He better show up. Otherwise,
it'll be your fault!

He'll show up, Cirilo.
No. No, he won't.

I'm sick and tired of all of this.

I don't like having this
guy here all the time!

Don't you realize he has nowhere to go?

Forgive me, Flora, but what
the fuck do I care?

Wait a second...

Kick him out!
He has no place in my house!

I'm not gonna take this. I'm leaving.
You heard him.

I don't want to be a bother.
But you're no bother!

Of course he's a bother! He bothers me!

Look, I'm leaving. So don't worry
about me anymore.

Don't worry about me, Florita. I'll find
somewhere to go.

See what you've done?

So what? Let him go.

He wasn't gonna last long here anyway.
Let him go.

Remember, Cirilo, this isn't your house.

But the furniture is!

Don't you understand
he has nowhere to go!

I can't believe you're doing this to me!

Pellín, please wait.

Look, Florita...

you and this house are the only two
things that I have left in this world.

If I lose that...
I know I'm going to die.

Is he gone?

Forgive me, Cirilo, but if you're not
willing to accept him in this house...

then you'll have to leave.

You prefer him over me.

You're not doing your part, Cirilo.
You're also an old man.

You know what it's like not having
a place to live!

You, better than anyone, should know
what he's going through.

Why should I solve his problems?

He's also my friend. Do it for me.

We were so happy before he showed up.

Don't be so selfish!

What is it you want me to do?

I want you to go outside right now...

apologize, and ask him to stay.

Pellín!

Pellín, wait!

Pellín!

What do you want?

Don't you think we're a
little too old for this?

You're pretty old for this.

Besides, the only one that's suffering
because of all of this is Florita.

If you know I don't like it when you
call her Florita, why do you do it?

Well... so you get used to it.

Shake hands with me.
They're watching you.

You're the one who's gonna get kicked out of
the house. Shake hands and be done with it!

I only do this because I love Flora.

But if it was up to me, you could
go fuck yourself.

Really? Wave. Wave.

Look over there and wave.

This silence would drive anyone crazy.

Hey, girl, marry him once and for all
so we can all go home.

Why don't you marry him?

I see a guy with a gun, I'll give
him my ass, if he asks for it.

Then give it to him.
It's not my ass he wants.

So do it.

Marry him, girl.

With what's available in this country,
one can't be too choosy.

What's the worst that can happen? If you
don't like it, you get a divorce.

But I don't want to get married!

All I want is to make you happy.
And you won't let me.

You're just being selfish.
Selfish, me?

I'm doing this because I love you.

You could've saved yourself the effort.

They say that there's seven women
to every man.

So?

Well, maybe one of the other
six wants to marry you.

Young man! I need to talk to you!

I have the priest here with me.
Have him come in.

No, no.
We've fulfilled our end of the bargain.

Now we need to see an act of
good faith from you...

and let the passengers go.

Yeah, sure. No.

Once the priest comes in,
I'll let someone go.

I can't do that.
I can't let the priest in there.

That would be one more person in there.

What a pain in the ass. Hang on.

You can go.
What?

Go ahead. You can go.

And miss the wedding?
Let someone else go.

You can go.
That would be against my principles.

I'm not going to abandon these people.
Pick someone else.

Who the hell wants to leave?

What's wrong with all of you?
Why won't you leave? Are you all stupid?

There's a guy threatening you with a
gun and no one wants to leave? Damn.

If that's the case, I'll go.

Go on. Get the hell outta here.

Go on.

Cool.

I'm leaving.

You're all fucking nuts!

Your blessing, Father.
God bless you, son.

We were waiting for you so
we could get married.

I'm Miguel, and this is the most
beautiful girl in the world, Marta.

What you pretend to do is not right.

Don't let evil thoughts cloud your mind.

Think of the gift our Lord has blessed us with,
and that's the gift of reason.

I called you here so you could marry us!

I'm trying to tell you that your actions
are driven by passion, not by reason.

You can't force love.

You come here to marry us or to give a
sermon? Go ahead and marry us.

I'm sorry, son, but marriage is sacred...

and in order to take place,
both must be willing parties.

Amen to that, Father.
What do you think?

That after all this I'm going to leave
empty-handed? I promised the Virgin!

Please understand. A marriage cannot take
place under these conditions.

Damn. You can't trust
anyone in this country.

I thought priests were different,
but you're all the same.

Please understand, son.
No, you understand.

Either you marry us or you're
going to meet Saint Peter right now.

Dearly beloved, we are here to celebrate
the union of these two children of God...

in sacred matrimony.

You're going to pay attention to this guy,
Father? This guy's nuts!

Trust me, my child. We have no choice.

Go on.
What's your name?

Her name's Marta.
Marta, do you take...

Miguel.
Do you take Miguel as your husband...

...to love and protect,
in sickness and in health...

for richer for poorer, for better
for worse, till death do you part?

Can you hear me, Miguel?
It's your mother!

Mom. That's my mom. Excuse me-

Unbelievable!

Can you hear me, Miguel?
It's your mother!

What are you doing here?

Get out of there and let those people go!
What are you doing?

I'm getting married!
The priest is going to marry us!

Stop before someone gets hurt! You're
making a mess of everything!

I can't, Mom. The priest and
the witnesses are waiting for me.

Think, Miguel! Think!

Mom, if you don't agree, then go.
Go and let me live my life!

She's the woman I've always dreamt about.
You don't even let me dream.

I'm not leaving without you.

I'm the only woman who's ever loved you.

I've cared for you, cooked for you,
washed your clothes.

I wiped your ass when you were covered in
shit! I'm the only woman you need!

Look, Mom, I want to be with her
for the rest of my life.

Don't you see what I've done for her?

Think, son! Just stop and think!

Take her away. Take her away.

Freeze. Lower your weapon. Do it now.

You fooled me.
It's over. Lower your weapon.

I'd rather die.
Lower it, goddamnit!

You lower it.

I don't want to shoot you!
Shoot, you son of a bitch.

Lower your weapon! Do it!

Shoot.
I do!

Are you crying?

Want some gum?

That boy of yours is something else.
Check out his new girlfriend.

That's my car!
Come back here, you asshole!

Your dad is a son of a bitch!

Come on, Lola!

Bless you.
Where's your father?

He left.

Ismaelito, this is very important.

We need to know if what Macho told your
mom about Tati is true.

Answer your grandmother.

Yes, it's true.

Hurray! One candle!

I have a surprise for you.
Another one?

What surprise could that be?
My goodness...

I'll be right back.

A bottle of homemade rum.

What is that, Flora?

Now that's really good.

I want us to celebrate with rum
because it's a very special night.

Not only because it's my birthday...

but also because I'm next to the two
men I love the most.

May you both live a long time.

Just out of curiosity, how many years
are we talking about?

You don't ask a lady her age!

Please, Cirilo. Seventy-two years young

Young and beautiful.
That deserves a drink.

I would like to make a toast.

To you, Flora.
You're a goddess. A true angel.

I'd like to make a toast...

because I'm living the most glorious
day of my life...

having returned to where I belong...

my home.

And next to you, Florita.

Don't get carried away.

That was tough. Another one. Another one.

Another one.

Another one. Another one. This is good!

That's good. Drink up.

If we're going to have another one,
we have to do another toast.

I toast to my rooster, Esteban.

I hope he's still alive and that one
day he'll return home.

And I toast to old people...

and the time we have left.

To life.
To life!

Damn!
Another one?

Another one.
Another one. Cheers.

To life.

One more. No? Well, I'd like one.

Distinguished lady.

I was watching you dancing all alone,
and I said to myself...

"I wonder if she would care to dance with
me?"

It would be an honor, sir.

Thank you.

Come and dance with us, Cirilo.

How do you expect me to dance
when I can't even walk?

Florita...

if it was up to me,
I could die right now.

Shut up and dance.

Look...
What? Careful.

Come on, let's go.

You need to know what this guy's like.

You're a... coward!

You need to lie down. You're drunk.

Fight like a man.

What's that all about? Such nonsense.

We just wanna have a good time.
So do I!

I wanna have a good time.
Time for bed.

I'm watching you.
Come on, come on.

Let's go to the room.
You need to go to sleep.

You're way too drunk. Come on, come on.

Time to go to sleep.
I don't want to sleep.

But look at yourself. Your night's over.

Why don't you love me?

I do love you.

Y love you very much.
And I also need you very much.

You feel anything?

Let's do it again, okay?
Okay.

...said to His disciples...

"Do not fear. Believe in God.

And also believe in me.

In my father's house are many mansions.

I am going there to
prepare a place for you."

You have a visitor.

How are you, son? It's so
good to see you. God bless you.

Guess what? The dog's pregnant.

I thought the neighbor's dog
was neutered, but I was wrong.

I don't know what I'm going to do.

Maybe give her away. I can't have all
those dogs running around the house.

The guards over here are real nice.

I brought them some avocados so that they
treat you well.

Son, are you... are you eating enough?

That was my favorite song.

I don't like that song.
But it's my favorite.

I bought you the CD.
But I wanted to listen to it.

Wait till we get home.
You're so unfair.

You're the one who's unfair.
I was so relaxed.

But I don't like that song!
Why do you have to annoy me?

I didn't do anything to you!
I'm done listening to you!

What about what I like?
No!
