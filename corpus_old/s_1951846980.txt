Welcome again.

It is a beautiful autumn morning
here in the County of Flagstaff.

I Am Marlene Love
and this is 104.7 KWVF...

...the sounds of the South.

As many of you they know...

...Halloween is to the turn
of the corner...

...and here in the County of Flagstaff,
Halloween is serious thing.

During the following hour
we will receive people's calls...

...that he/she wants to share
their fearful experiences...

...with some of the more ones
thrilling legends...

...of Halloween of West Virginia.

I know that when he/she was girl...

...I always got scared
the stable of my grandparents...

...specially at night.

For a lot of time I believed
that the same cuckoo...

...he/she lived in a pile of hay
behind my grandfather's tractor.

Some nights
he/she went there undercover...

...and he/she could swear that he/she heard it breathe...

...through the old splints
of the stable, waiting for me.

But now we have Henry
in the line two.

Henry says that he wants to share
a legend of West Virginia...

...that it is and I mention it
literally 100% truth.

Henry, you are in the air
with Marlene Love.

Count us your thrilling history.

What I will be, Marlene,
it is not a thrilling history.

No?

You are for sure you called
to the correct program?

What I will be is true.

It is this way, our operator told it to us.

Count us then which this is
real legend of West Virginia.

In the forest there is
a giant man...

...a man with the face
so destroyed...

...that he/she covers it completely
with a mold of plaster.

Go, Henry, goes more slowly.

Of what forest languages?

Not I can tell it to you.

Why not?

Because I don't want that nobody goes there.

Where?

To their territory.

Good, Henry, waits;
you say that there is a man...

...with a great mold of plaster
white in the head...

...that he/she lives in some part off the one
forest in West Virginia...

...but what there is
of thrilling in that?

What is there of thrilling in that?

That he/she is not a man.

He/she is a monster;
and for that reason I call you, Marlene...

...to notice to all
that they don't enter to the forest.

But you have not told us
in what forest.

That doesn't care, Marlene.

This man doesn't have limits...

...he/she doesn't have opposite.

Not it follows any moral code.

It can be everywhere that you are.

And what he/she has of monstrous
that man, that man of plaster?

If it is not indiscretion?

Their face doesn't have face.

Their eyes are blacker than
the darkest night of December.

Their hands are giant
and in form of two...

...as hooks to hang the meat,
of those that can destroy you.

Their heart, if it exists...

...it is more sterile than those
depths of the hell.

This man is the nightmare
of all boy.

Marlene, you remember
that at the beginning of the show...

...you spoke of the cuckoo that he/she lived
in the stable of your grandparents?

Yes, what is there with that?

This... this man is the cuckoo.

Shit.

Good, that told him/her.

I told him/her: "Look, if he/she wants
to reprove me, make it.

Not I will read a book
of 2,000 pages...

...to pass their final exam."

Kendricks played me
last spring.

Not it is as hard as he/she wants
to make believe that it is.

As you you say.
But I won't follow their class.

I will recapture it the next semester
with Moyer.

They have to stop to speak of classes
while we are on vacation.

Are they crazy or what does it pass them?

We go in route to Miami
and you speak of classes.

I am impatient
to nail him/her the fingernails...

...to some of those handsome ones
of South Beach.

What is there of your new boyfriend?

Rum.

Speaking of him,
he/she looks at what gave me.

Allow me to see it.

More than a ring...

...it seems the prize that he/she comes
in the cereal boxes.

Veto to the carajo.

I am only surprised it
that an university student...

...he/she can buy a stone like that.

He/she comes from a rich family
and privileged.

All your boyfriends...

...they come from rich families
and privileged, or not?

It seems then that you don't go
to have a good time in Miami.

Good, you already know what you/they say:

When the mouse is not,
the cat ago...

Good, like be.

Speaking of Miami,
who of you, losers...

...he/she knows exactly
where are we?

You dressed the whole traffic
that there were in 95 o'clock?

We were lucky of leaving us on time.

Also, all these
rural highways...

...they are parallel
to the main highway.

How do you know it?

You really want to look
a map?

Yes, of course.

While they make their foolishness,
can you park yourself?

I have to urinate.

Where are the maps?

In the guantera.

Which of all?

That of the states of the southeast
probably.

Here it is.

Good...

...now he/she finds West Virginia.

Here it is.

Maggie, you remember
how exit takes in 95 o'clock?

I believe that between the 34 and the 37.

I amused.

Thank you.

Yes, devils.

Miami, there we go.

What devils does it happen?

It is my mom's car.

They come to see this.

What is it?
Is yours?

I found it in that field.

There is money inside.

Man, what is all this?

Money free, friend;
money for Miami.

Money for the beach,
for the swig...

...for the girls.

It is the money of Janine
Alexander...

...it is not yours.

Whichever that is
that Janine Alexander...

...it is obvious that it is not desperate
to recover their handbag.

You look at it, it seems that ago
more than one month that is there.

Not you can stay it.
Not it is yours.

Yes, let us put it of turn
where it was...

...and vámonos.

We Go, Steve.

Steven, looks.

Here there are medicines.

That small poor person
he/she should be wondering...

...where their things are.

Not it is our matter.
Now yes.

I am sure
that he/she lives here.

There is surely
an address or something.

Here it is.

16 Sherman Hill Road,
Ellis, West Virginia.

Where are we?

Don't we know it, do you remember?

At least we can
to ask to somebody somewhere around.

Not we lose anything.

How you know
that it is their address?

It is in the first page
of their notebook, how more it could be?

Is somebody hungry?

I die from hunger.

He/she could eat something.

Good...

...we will stop in the next one
place that we see...

...we will ask to somebody there
and we follow our road.

Well?
Thank you.

How does he/she go them?

Very well, but
we are hungry...

...a lot of hunger.

Follow me.

I can sit down
to the window?

It happens.

What do they want to take?

For me, it dilutes.
Me the same thing.

Do they have lemonade?

Yes, clear.

Anything for me.

I not even understand
what puts here.

He/she knows what a God he/she will say.

Of what they speak
those articles?

It is...

...anything.

They are of ten years ago.

Of what are these pictures?

That there seems blood.

Not it is blood.

How much money there was
in the handbag?

$500.

It is a lot of money
to leave to walk.

Not I believe that it is necessary him/her.

What do you, David know?

If he/she needed it,
it would have continued him/her the track...

...or at least there was
returned to that place.

That money would rot us
to be useful in Miami.

You could pay me a masseur
with that money.

At least we should attempt
to make the correct thing.

And what is the correct thing?

Maggie?

The correct thing is that who
he/she is it it is him.

There is an address in the handbag;
we should attempt...

...to be returned it.

How you know that it is
the girl's address?

You don't know it.

Where is the address?

He/she takes.

When the waiter returns,
I will ask it to him.

Thank you.

But if he/she doesn't know it...

...we keep the money,
we throw the handbag...

...and we forget the matter,
of agreement?

That same I think.

Of agreement?

It is well.

Good.

We will order.
I am hungry.

What I can bring them...

...of eating?

Excuse.

We are lost.
Can he/she tell me where this place is?

Excuse,
do they look for this address?

Yes.

Not we are of here.

Yes, good, I sit down it.

I never heard speak of a town
called Ellis.

Where are we then?

In Rolling Glen, with a population
of 314 inhabitants.

As I told them, I never heard speak
of a called town Ellis.

Thank you.

What can I bring them of eating?

That was very useful.

Are you already satisfied?

Me yes.

We go in route to Miami
and we are $500 richer.

Steven?
What?

Can we stop once again?
Only for...

No, Maggie, not.
He/she listens.

I asked to the waiter,
that is everything.

Did you dress their face? Not he/she had
neither he/she devises of what we spoke.

He/she never heard speak of Ellis.

Ellis could be
to 300 miles of here.

We Go, Steven.

Maggie, listens.

Hundred of travelers happen
every day for this highway.

Not it is anything serious
and it is not my problem.

My problem is to return at 95 o'clock
and of there to Miami.

If that it was your handbag,
would not you want it of turn?

If it was my handbag...

...he/she would not have left it
to a side of the highway.

This well, we can stop
once again?

And I will give for closed the matter,
I promise it to you.

We go.

Good, it is well.
We have to put gasoline.

I will stop in first o'clock
station that he/she sees...

...but you will ask.

The sheriff's office
of Rolling Glen.

Sheriff Taggart?

Him same.
Who does speak?

Earl, is Peggy, of Pete's.

Hello, pretty.

You continue staying the eggs
fresher for my omelets, truth?

Earl, it has always been this way.

Wonderful.
What can I make for you?

Good, some outsiders end up
of being here...

...and they asked how to arrive
to Sherman Hill Road.

Were hunters?

No, young boys,
university students in fact.

Do you know what they will make somewhere around?

No, they didn't say it.

Are they still there?

No, they left he/she makes a while.

I will be in charge of of that, Peggy.

Earl. Earl.

Yes?

The matter is that
when asking the road...

...they asked for Ellis,
not for Rolling Glen.

Ellis?

I know it, I also stayed
astonished as...

Earl?

What devils it passes him/her
to that man?

What does it pass him/her?
Hello.

Already coarse.
He/she can that it is deaf.

To the devil with that type. We will look for
gasoline in another part. Impossible.

Give me one minute.
I already return.

It can fill the tank
with the regular one?

Not I have gasoline.

Pardon?

The bomb is
drier than a bone.

Where more I can
to get gasoline?

Not there is another place
in 50 miles to the round one...

...that I know.

But what does old Artie know?

It returns tomorrow afternoon.

Tomorrow afternoon
the gasoline will arrive.

It arrives every third Monday.

Good, thank you.

He/she can maybe help us.

It depends of what type
of help they look for.

Artie doesn't make miracles.

Artie neither is magpie...

...so don't request anything
related with that shit.

We only look for an address.

Here he/she has it.

Sherman Hill Road?

Yes, I know
Sherman Hill Road...

But it is not in Ellis.

Good, thank you anyway.

Ellis no longer exists, boy.

Undoubtedly it continues existing
the earth where was...

...but most of people
of here...

...he/she prefers to call it
Rolling Glen now.

Is so this Ellis?
Did they only change him/her the name?

That would be a summary.

But Ellis was different.

Some how many square miles
of farmers, journeymen and drunkards.

In that then, most
of people of the town...

...he/she lived up
of the mountains.

There it is where it is
Sherman Hill Road.

Although now there is no longer anything.

At the moment all live here
below in the town.

Why did they change him/her the name?

Why everybody lowered
of the hills?

Bad memories...

...and histories of ghosts.

And those they are things in those that
Artie doesn't want to participate.

Good, how I arrive
to that address...

...that I gave him/her?

You don't believe to Artie.

Not I know what to believe.

He/she takes this highway...

...some four miles.

At the end to the right...

...you will see a street without name.

I believe that the sheriff was
being about closing it completely...

...but I doubt that he/she has still made it.

It follows that highway for some miles...

...and to your right you will see...

Sherman Hill Road.

Well, thank you.

Come closer to Artie.

Pardon?

Allow me to see your hand.

What?

They always say that you can see
of what a man is made...

...just by looking at their hands.

Yes, in fact you are the man.

God.

You are sure
that it is here?

There is snow in the floor.

The man of the station
of gasoline...

...he/she said that the place was up
of the mountain.

Steve, that was or later
that it was about licking your fingers?

It is cold in the mountains.

When it is cold, it snows.

Not I know how more to tell them.

Also, it was not my idea.

But you are a better man
to make it.

Go, this place
it is enormous:

It is really big.

You know the parties
that we could make here?

Let us see if there is somebody
at home:

Not it seems that there was nobody.

Steve, seemed
that from decades...

...there is not nobody there.

Steven, we go.

He/she waits, I believe that I listened
to somebody to give a lash.

Walk you to the shit.

Did you call?

No, it is open.

Not there is mail.

Not you can enter this way.

Steve, lover...

...when we plan this trip
for the winter vacations...

...nobody mentioned that it would be
in the terrace of a farm...

..."where the devil lost the poncho",
West Virginia.

So personally,
he/she wanted to take advantage of the deviation...

...and you are being
a tremendous maricón.

Good, they already heard
to the lady.

Something is only altered.

Yes, something.

Hello.

He/she hears, we have your handbag.

We think that maybe
you were looking for it.

Not it seems that there was nobody
at home. Vámonos.

He/she waits,
we should stay.

The door was open.
It maybe passes something bad.

This is the field.

People leave the door
open the whole time.

Now you are being
a tremendous maricón.

Follow it.

Excellent, I have to continue
to the crazy prostitute.

You invited it.

He/she Waits, Audra.

I tell you a thing:
If somebody lives here...

...they forgot in what decade we are.

My grandmother has furniture
as these.

Your grandmother didn't know
in what century he/she lived.

What?

Anything.

Brilliant.

That was Audra.

Audra.

What disgust.
What did it happen?

He/she looks at that.

You should be joking.

No, he/she looks at this, Maggie.

It stinks.

That is disgusting.

Don't play it.

What loss of time.

What disgust.

What carajo
was that?

It seemed the door.

I won't open up.

We should see
who is.

Wait, not even
we live here.

We will open up. Everything is well.
You stay here.

Steve, we don't live here.

Everything is well.
Calm.

We should be in route to Miami...

...and they want to play to
the cottage and to open the door.

It is a house of crazy.

Hello.

It was point of taking
the freedom of entering.

Commissary Earl Taggart
of Rolling Glen.

Is there some problem?

I don't know it.
Tell it to me you.

He/she begins explaining to me
what devils faces in this house.

Good, this it is...

This is the house of my grandparents...

...and them... they left it to him
to my parents.

We came to see...

...that everything was in order.

And is everything in order?

Not I am sure.
We have just arrived.

How do you call yourself, son?

Steve.

Steve Dixon.

You should be the grandson
of Silas then, not?

Yes, Mister, it is this way.

What it punishes that that
did it pass him/her, not?

A pain.

He/she gives an enormous pain when
they pass him/her horrible things...

...to good people.

Yes.

Good, I cannot allow them
to be in this property.

The whole area
it is closed.

To anybody he/she is allowed to be here.

Why not?

As I said... Steve.

Yes, clear, Steve.

The highway
that it is here behind...

...to some four miles for this side
and seven for this other one...

...that whole area is closed.

Not it is safe
that they stay here.

And I cannot give myself the luxury
that it passes a tragedy...

...being me to the control.

It would not be well.

He/she knows, sheriff, seriously
we wanted to leave.

But we don't have gasoline
neither where to go.

So we will wait
until tomorrow...

...to that gasoline arrives
to the station of the town.

Artie Stewart?

Artie won't receive it
gasoline neither tomorrow...

...neither next week,
neither next month...

...neither next year.

That lunatic's station
it doesn't work...

...from the crisis of
the Cuban missiles.

What?

He/she hears, son, I cannot help you
with that of the gasoline...

...but I can escort you
of turn to the freeway...

...only we have to leave
right now.

Not you will want to be here
when it gets dark.

Here they pass incredible things
to the evening.

As what things?

In these fields there are jackals
and bears and wild animals.

Not you will want to be them
to the evening, son, believe me.

Jackals?

It is this way, jackals.

Here I have seen hunters...

...with weapons of first...

...and nobody has seen them
or heard again.

Finally we should say:
"It was already enough."..

...and we close the whole area.

It is safer this way.

Yes, but sheriff
we would not cause...

...we are not about causing
problems.

But these always
they seem to find...

...to who don't look for them,
certain is not?

Good, I like to know it,
sheriff.

What pass good night...

...and cuídes...

Let us see what he/she has here,
does lady abut?

He/she takes notes for their class
in the school?

He/she prepares a report on
the history of this area?

The history is good.

He/she becomes trained to not making
the same errors of the past.

Now, if the encounter here
when returning tonight...

...I will contain them to both.

So follow my advice
and vanish.

What was all that?

I believe that we end up...

...of knowing
the southern hospitality.

Not I know you, but I don't want
to pass my whole vacations...

...in a jail of rustic...

...so I suggest that we continue
their advice and we release ourselves.

He/she not even saw them to you.

How good, because people this way
in a place as this...

...they don't come with good eyes
to people as me.

Man, calm down.

We still have to find
to somebody that can give us gasoline.

There was a bar
in the highway.

Maybe somebody there can tell us
where to find a station.

No, I won't leave. I disgust.
I have to take a shower.

There are dead animals
in the drawers and things...

He/she looks, you hold back.
I want to release myself of here.

Somebody should stay
in case the owner returns.

I will stay.

Not you have just heard the sheriff?

Not there is owner.

He/she could have said it
to get scared.

Good that Audra stays.

Not it can be alone.

No, Maggie is right.

Good, the commissary didn't see them
to none of both.

If we cross with him
in the town and you see them...

...it will bother him/her that
we have lied him/her.

So it is better
that we don't provoke it.

Maggie and I maybe can
to find somebody in the bar...

...that he/she can tell us where
to find a station of gasoline.

It is hour of taking a shower. Do you come?

No, step.

You get lost it.

David?

David, are you?

David, is very cold.

You want to sleep in my bed
tonight?

David?

David, you arrive too much afternoon.

You got lost the shower.

Devils, how much will I have slept?

Audra!

Where are you?

I ring cheap.

Shit.

To the carajo with the ring.

Old, where it can be
that girl?

Good afternoon, Earl.

Hello, pretty.

Coffee?
Of course.

Do you know what, Peg?
Better than it is decaffeinated.

Then...

...do you want the customary thing?

That sounds well,
pretty.

Jerry, give me
a double omelet...

...without bacon and a portion of puree
of potatoes for the sheriff.

At once.

Is everything well, Earl?
You are very quiet.

Everything is well.

You found the boys
of those that I spoke to you?

Right now they are in the house
of old Dixon.

What devils are they making there?

One of them says to be...

...the grandson of Silas Dixon...

...but I don't believe him/her.

Not he/she knew that Silas...

...he/she had grandsons.

Me neither.

And the girl that was
with the boy...

...he/she had a notebook of notes
full with newspaper cuttings...

...on Ellis.

Do clip?

On the incident.

God, another time that of Williams.

There are boys in the house
of Dixon, sheriff?

Not it is your matter, Jerry.

My friends and I were accustomed to
to challenge us to see who went there.

For that reason it is that the half
of your high school friends...

...they are dead or in the jail.

Most of times...

...Frankie picked up us
in their Trans Am...

...after stealing him/her a recruit
of vodka to their old ones...

...and we left there up.

A couple of times was
in bicycle...

...round trip, six miles
in the total darkness.

Not we had been able to make it
unless there was full moon.

Not there is he/she swims there up.

Of course.

My friends and me
we always heard things...

...noises, noises
human real.

They were sometimes as wailings.

They were sometimes...

...almost as roars.

You and your friends were
hallucinating or they were drunk.

Not there is anything dangerous there,
except for the wild life.

It didn't scare us the life
wild, sheriff.

We were him/her afraid
to "face of plaster."

Not I want hear again
to never say that name.

Did you understand me?

The face of plaster is real,
sheriff, I know it!

I have seen it
with my own eyes.

You are only a terrible one
lying drunkard.

He/she sometimes hides
the dirt under the carpet...

...only for a while, sheriff.

It is left again of there.

Long of my view.

Audra!

Let us go, Audra!

We go, don't play with me.
You know that I suffer of the heart.

Prostitute rat.

Let us should maybe leave.

While quicker we find
somebody that helps us...

...quicker we will leave of here.

It seems that we have a couple
of faces new tonight.

Hello.
You smell well.

A beer, please.

He/she waits.

Not you know that it is bad education
to order before the lady?

What would you like, sweet lips?

It dilutes it is well.

And you, what you said that you wanted,
bad-mannered boy?

A beer.

Well, at once I bring them
two beers.

He/she knows where we would rot
to get gasoline?

Stations of gasoline?

All go to Monroe
to get gasoline.

Not there is he/she swims here.
Not the trucks arrive.

Why not?
He/she looks to your surroundings, girl.

Not he/she is a population
the sufficiently big thing.

What so far from here
is Monroe?

Monroe is some
50 miles to the south.

Is your girl very pretty, do you know?

Yes, thank you.

Hello, pretty.

My name is Henry.

Hello.

You am only
bothering.

Good...

...and from where do they come?

We are only of passing
on the way to Miami.

We stopped in...

...in Ellis...

...but the sheriff said
that we could not stay.

So only we look for somebody
that he/she helps us with the gasoline...

...and we release ourselves.

Ellis.

You mean Rolling Glen.

They told us that it was
the same place.

Yes, it is it.

It is it.

Although it is amusing to hear
that somebody calls it Ellis.

He/she makes much of that.

And why he/she told them
the sheriff Taggart...

...that they should leave?

He/she told us something on bears
and jackals...

...that they have had too many
incidents with hunters and that.

He/she said that the whole area
it is closed.

Idiocies.

And do you believe him/her?

Good, why would he/she lie us?

Son, you are not of here.

I will tell you the truth
on Taggart.

He/she is prostitute's son
more immodest...

...with the one that I was.

The prostitute mouth, Henry closes.

He/she doesn't fall well because
every week...

...it takes you to the jail.

Not you have neither he/she devises, Donnie.

What happens is that
I know the true history...

...why Taggart doesn't want
that nobody goes to Ellis.

In 1989...

...it should be ago more
of 15 years...

...Taggart was only a he-goat
with boy's face...

...beginning as
sheriff in Ellis.

You only had to rub him/her the ass
correctly...

...and he/she would help you to
that they retired the positions.

And your name cleaned.

All less you, Henry.

Be quiet the prostitute mouth, Donnie.

Anyway, one night...

...about this time of the year...

...a truck driver that managed
of Maine to Florida...

...he/she stops to drink something...

...a type black and big call...

...called Ray Williams.

You are counting him/her...

...Ray's history Williams
another time?

Of course, devils.

Here nobody the bill.

Anyway...

...a black truck driver
called Ray Williams...

...he/she stops one night
to drink something.

And in what bar, Henry?

For what I listened...

...it could have been this same one.

Certain that is?

In fact...

...I listened that he/she entered
and he/she sat down...

...in that seat of the corner.

You are bad of the head.

Ray Williams...

...it is very tired of managing...

...as, 1,000 miles
in the last 20 hours.

He/she enters, he/she sits down
in the corner of there.

He/she requests a beer.

It is at night one Friday...

...and all the boys
that they had worked...

...in the cornfields...

...they enter with the pay
in their hand:

Enough drunkards were already
when Williams arrived.

The rumors say that for
their color or what is...

...that Williams and some
of the boys...

...they began to
to exchange words.

The words warmed...

...and about ten boys...

...they began to hit
to the poor dog son.

You already see, speaking of the place
mistaken...

...in the mistaken moment.

They hit it here
during a time.

They took out it out.
They hit it even more.

Here it is where the history
it becomes interesting.

Seemingly they hit...

...to this Williams so much...

...that their face, no longer
you could recognize.

And when they finished
of hitting it...

...they were already passing the
drunkenness so took its body...

...to the old ranch Dixon
and they threw it.

In the house of Dixon?

Yes. Why?

Not it cares.
Not it cares.

Anyway,
some days later...

...one of them opens the mouth...

...and it reports the incident
to Taggart.

When the police arrived there,
they cannot find the cadaver.

Then Taggart says:
"Without cadaver, there are not tests."..

...and he/she testifies saying more
of the same garbage...

...in all their trials.

None of them
it is processed...

...and none spends
a contained day...

...and Taggart strolls as
if it was a puto super hero.

But after one year...

...two years later...

...they begin to happen accidents.

People, hunters...

...they leave to the corn...

...but they never return:

From time to time, the police
he/she finds a cadaver.

They usually disappear
without leaving rake.

So one day, about ten years ago...

...Taggart condemns everything
the region when they abandoned...

...and they never found the cadaver
of Ray Williams.

He/she looks, boy,
I know the truth.

The truth is that
Ray Williams is not dead.

For sure it is there out
eating animals to survive...

...and killing the one who
among in their territory.

Why he/she doesn't leave,
I don't know it.

Who knows in what state
their body will be...

...after the beating that he/she received...

...especially without treatment
doctor neither anything.

But it is alive
and it is there out.

For heaven's sake, sure
that it is angry.

Histories of ghosts;
it is what is.

The boys like to go
there to make pendejadas...

...to get scared each other.

For sure you would not go
there at night.

Not I have reasons
to go there.

I have wife and son.

Not I will make myself the fool
with any legend.

Face of plaster is not a legend.

Face of plaster?

It is this way like they call...

...to old Ray Williams.

Doesn't he/she make you laugh?

There are people that says to have seen...

...to a man to wander somewhere around...

...with a big plaster
on their head probably...

...because Ray's face Williams
it was so destroyed...

...that him same he/she tried to fix it.

Face of plaster?

Face of plaster is correct.

He/she looks, boy, to me not me
they would find there at night.

It is all that I say.

You know where we can
to buy gasoline?

Boy, this pendejo
neither he/she has a car.

Thank you anyway.
Good night.

He/she Hears, Jerry.

I will turn off the lights
in about five minutes...

...is it well?

Not there is problem.
Almost I finished here.

I am getting ready
a bite before leaving.

I sit down it, we already close.

Look, we already close the kitchen.

Can he/she return tomorrow, yes?

Is somebody there?

Hello?

He/she Hears, Jerry,
I already leave.

Can you close when I leave?

Jerry, do you hear me?

Devils, he/she is listening that
damned radio the whole time.

Jerry, I said...

Of what do you think?

Why I left me the freeway.

You accuse yourself to yourself
for all this?

I am who is managing.

Yes, but you tried to make
this more interesting trip.

Not you knew what will happen.

Also, I believe that the blame is mine.

I am who wanted
to return that stupid handbag.

Good, at least your idiot devises
it got us a place where to stay.

Yes, it is an old farm
that it puts fear...

...in the mean of he/she swims her
that it doesn't belong us...

...and in the one that you/they say that he/she inhabits
a murderer in series...

...but it is better than sleeping
in the car.

Steven, you didn't believe yourself...

...what those boys said
in the bar, certain?

No.

That is to say, it is only a history
local of ghosts.

Each town has one.

To me it didn't happen me.

In my town we didn't have
a history of ghosts.

No? Because you got lost it.

Seriously?

Good, when it was
in the primary one...

...our recess patio was
surrounded of forests...

...and all the bigger boys
they used to speak to the smallest...

...on a man of black...

...that he/she lived in the forests.

He/she had a black knife,
it dressed a black long coat...

...and he/she had a big and black dog...

...that he/she never barked
and it always continued him/her.

Yes, you laugh.

That God helped you if you had
that to pick up a ball in the forest.

We already return.

Did you really believe in him?

In who?

The man of black.

No, but I believe that
when you are younger...

...you are willing to believe you
many things...

...but when you make yourself something bigger...

...you look for something realler.

My God.

What devils?

Where devils were they?

Calm.
We were in the bar.

Audra is not!

What you mean
that it is not?

I say that their vixen ass
it is not in the house.

I don't find it in any side.

It was supposed that they should be together.

How much does he/she make that it disappeared?

He/she looks, I went to bed
to sleep a nap...

...fair when you left.

When I woke up several
hours later, it was no longer.

Devils, calm.

He/she waits.

It grabs this.

Steve, is not in the house!

Then where it is?

David?

Not he/she has car!

Why would he/she leave?

Does that think?

Because he/she looks...

...this is what I think.

I believe that he/she put on their shoes
of vixen...

...and he/she left to the highway
main...

Then you got into the first car...

...that it was enough stupid
to brake.

David, that doesn't make sense.

Sense?

He/she looks...

...don't speak to me of sense.

What doesn't make sense
it is to manage...

...to the mean of he/she swims her for
to return the handbag of a girl.

That that non sense
it is to be here stopped...

...in this old house
so unpleasant...

...when we should be
in the beach in Miami.

That is it that for me
he/she doesn't make sense.

I leave.

What does it happen?

Give me the keys!

Devils!

We go. We go.

Let us go! Devils!
Not there is gasoline.

God!

Audra is not
in the house.

Did you already look up?

Yes, he/she makes a while.

Good, he/she looks another time and...

Maggie and I will look
here below.

He/she waits, I have to go
up me alone?

Yes.

Is it because I am black?

No, it is because it scares me
the darkness.

He/she really gets scared
the darkness?

No.

Afraid of the darkness?

Why to me not me
does it scare the darkness?

Not I know where it will be.

He/she would not leave without
to say something to somebody.

The sheriff maybe took it to him.

But why
was not it taken to David?

David was sleeping.

She was maybe out...

...and David slept while
everything happened.

It is dark out.
She would not leave somewhere around.

Not he/she makes sense.

Did you listen that?

The what an one?

It should be the seeing.

What devils?

Teeth?

It is disgusting.

Why they continue lit
the lights?

Peggy?

Today you have a special one
at night?

My God.

Steven.

Steven.

Steven!

We should leave of here.

Vámonos, we have
that to leave of here.

Who is there?

David, vámonos!
Where is Steve?

We Go, David.
God!

David, listens, please.

Maggie, what does it happen?

Devils, you should calm down
and to tell me...

My God.

We go, he/she enters, he/she enters.

You should be quiet.

You have to tranquilize yourself.

Calm or he/she will discover us.

Is it well?

What will we make?

I don't know it, devils.

We should maybe escape.

Not I will be able to run
more than him.

Then
we are caught.

We should try to crawl
without he/she listens to us.

Not we can make that.

The floor is
too noisy.

I should attempt it.

No, Maggie.

Shit.

Run, run, run!

Run!

That nobody moves.

Sheriff, thanks to God that arrived.
They want to kill us.

Is that certain?

Yes, yes. Not it is joke.
We should leave.

Now it is below.

Where was it?
Really?

Yes, it is there.

Good, because it should
to be very quiet...

...because I don't listen anybody.

Who devils are you?

Mr., my name is David.
Where were you before?

Did you hide, boy?

Yes, did you hide, certain?

Children, I knew from the moment
that they arrived to my city...

...they would cause me problems.

Sheriff, this is
a malentendido.

What is a malentendido...

...it is that they killed Peggy and Jerry
in the restaurant...

...because that understands it
very well, devils.

Not we kill anybody.

The things were calmed
here during 15 years.

In 15 years...

...anything happened in
this city...

...except several
drunkards' fights.

Now you pendejos appears...

...and I have two cadavers
in my hands.

Please, he/she should listen...
Be quiet!

Not I came to socialize with
you, murderers.

Now, against the wall!

What they are, a couple
of reporters?

They write for their pathetic one
university newspaper.

They come here for
to discover the truth...

...on the history
of Ray Williams?

Of what is he/she speaking?

From time to time...

...they come a pendejos couple
inquisitive as you...

...to sniff, to look for tracks.

Not there is you step.

Ray Williams is dead.

Of what is he/she speaking?

I know of what he/she speaks.

Ray Williams:

Camionera of Maine, black.

He/she stopped in Ellis to drink something...

...and a group of local
they hit him/her brutally...

...and they left their body in a field.

And here the sheriff Taggart helped
to that absolved them.

None of them happened
neither one second in the jail.

Not he/she had why to be in Ellis.

It hid it.

I made my work.

My responsibility is
with people of this city.

Also, nobody will miss...

...to a black boy
anyway.

Idiot!

David.

What devils was that?

Who is up?

He/she already knows who is.

Care, heart.
He/she looks at what you say.

Ray Williams is up.

Ray Williams is dead!

Don't play it!

I will bury you, boy...

...and the Mr. he/she knows that I am
good burying things.

Better he/she prays that
your other friend...

...have a good place where
to hide...

...because when he/she finds it,
I will kill him.

That nobody moves a puto muscle
until he/she returns.

We won't move.

I know that they won't make it.

David!

David.

Not I can breathe.
David.

God, David. God.

We will be well.

Mags, hurts me a lot.

David, we will leave of here.

I promise it to you.

No, I don't believe.

No!

David.

I sit down it a lot.

Where are you, boy?

Are you there, son?

To hide you won't help.

They come here.

I want to show you that that
I made to your black friend.

I have them.

No! No!

No! No!

No!
