... chronic pain.

...to alleviate their
sufferings, and we

already mentioned
one breathing,

and people have to
reach a book to get

all the other very helpful
steps. What would you like...

anyone dealing with pain
to learn and take away...

... after they read your book.

That's a great question!

I think that the lesson
that I learned over,

you know, almost 15 years
of practice and working with

thousands and thousands
of people... is...

we are our own best healers.
And, the best tool, you know,

the strongest medicine,
or the best procedure,

the greatest technology
that we have is really

within ourselves.
And once we...

we realize how to utilize
what's inside of us...

and to heal, you know,
what's been damaged

or broken. Once we...
we embrace that

and we take charge of the
power of our lives...

as opposed to giving all
the control away to

the doctors, and the ma-

Take... can you get that end?
Yeah.

Okay.

You got it?
A little light.

We're making
really good time.

You're amazing at this.

Really fantastic.

I've never moved...
What have you...

I don't...

The pink... desk.
What desk?

Ew, this is stained.
Let's switch it.

How did that get there?

I don't know!
How did it get there?

Hey, Jen. Have you seen
my Little Dorrit anywhere?

Your what?

Little Dorrit... ha-

Have you seen
my copy of Little Dorrit?

Yes. No.
Which one?

Uh, it was on my desk.
It's not in my bag.

It's probably in
one of the boxes.

Yeah...

Yeah, I guess.

Do you know where we
packed the can opener?

Um... no...

I'm not sure.

Are we cooking?

Are you kidding?
India Palace!

Cool.

Leave Charlie
a message.

Hey, Charlie. Jen and I
are going...

to Palace. If you're around
and feel like coming,

um, you could meet us there
or you can... uh...

Disregard. Cancel that.
I'll talk to you later.

What?
Couple time.

We just moved in.
It's couple time.

You can have your play date
with Charlie tomorrow.

I am officially exhausted.

I feel like I'm pregnant
with a litter of Samosas.

You know they invented zero?

Hmm?
India. Indians.

They invented zero.

Roman numerals don't have
a separate sign for zero.

The Europeans got it from
the Indians.

It's essential to all
modern math. You can't even

do algebra without it.

But when the first...

crew from the
British East India company

heard about it, they thought
that it disproved the existence

of God. And they went
on this crazy rampage,

of rape and murder,
and so...

The Captain,

of that expedition...

No, I'm just trying
to remember.

Um, right...
He...

He was the one
who decided

that no one was
to ever know about it.

And so it was like, 80 years,

before it ever made it's way
back up to Europe.

80 years.

Why you laughing?

No, it's an incredible story.

I didn't know it before.
I just...

That's incredible.

You are so smart.

Yeah.

How much of that one
was actually true?

All of it.
Mm.

Essentially. Well...
More or less.

You are such a liar.

I can't believe I'm shacking up
with a dishonest man.

You know who
I'm really gonna miss?

Nancy.
Nancy! Sadly.

It's really
tearing me up inside.

Poor Paul.

Do you think that
in order to ease the transition

you could, blast Prokofiev
at 3 a.m. and...

leave your toenail clippings
all over the coffee table

for days and days?

Oh Paul, I'll even leave
my used tampons

floating in the toilet.

It'll be like
she's in the next room.

You'd do that?

I like you, Jen.

I like you too, Paul.

For the people
that this was written for,

there was no question,
like that.

Fate was, by definition,

that which
could not be avoided.

And if it is... a really
shitty fate, like Oedipus',

Well, that just...
That sucks for him.

So, what do you guys think?

I mean, is it... fair to...

punish someone
for something that

is pre-ordained
for them to do?

Ah, Sophia!

What's your policy
on "incompletes?"

Wow, that is just
really encouraging.

Um...

It's nice to hear everyone's
keeping their options open.

Okay, my policy
on incompletes is that

I'm kind of a dick about 'em.
I'll give you one, if you have

an airtight excuse, but...

your story has to be
pretty impressive.

Okay?

Alright.

That's it, we're out of time.

See you guys on Friday.

Paul...

I am sure I cannot
express to you how tired

I am of having
this conversation.

Did you or did you not
march in here four weeks ago

and announced that you had
turned a corner?

I did.

And?

And it's fine...
I'm just...

Um, it's slow going.

Evidently, you have not
taken the substance

of our conversations
to heart.

Let me see if you
know the words.

What do I say next?

Come on.

You come on.

What comes next?

First you disarm me by telling
me how much you admire the

work I did as
an under-graduate.

Correct.

Then?

And then...

You remind me sternly
that I...

I've been through
with my coursework

for nearly two years,
and that if I don't

turn in some chapters soon...
By Christmas.

By... by Christmas!

That... um. You will
have to seriously consider...

I will almost certainly.

That you... alright, that you
will almost certainly...

recommend that I, um,
be asked to withdraw

from the program.

Very good.

Apparently you were paying
closer attention than ya let on.

Paul?

What are you doing babe?

Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

What's the matter?

I can't sleep.

Come back to bed.

Come on.

What's the matter?

You have work tomorrow.

Tomorrow morning.

Don't worry about it.

Just tell me what's the matter.

Just...

Do you want me to tell
you about the Dark Crystal?

Or Ladyhawk?

Ladyhawk.

Okay.

Close your eyes...

In medieval France,

there once lived a young man
and a mouse.

The mouse was a thief.

He was about to be executed.

Nancy! Hi, it's Paul.

Listen, sorry to bother you,
but um, I'm calling cause

I think... I prob-

pretty sure I left a book
in the apartment

of my hardcover copy
of Little Dorrit.

Charles Dickens?
Um...

I probably left it
in the living room,

on the table, but it...
it might be...

...on the floor in my old room.

Anyway, um, I really need it,
so if you could let me know

when would be convenient
to come by and get it

that'd be great! Um...
Give me a call. Thanks a lot.

Nancy, hey, it's Paul again.

I'm sorry to bombard you
with messages, but I...

don't know if I mentioned
the uh, Little Dorrit

the book I left,
is pretty urgent.

I actually need it
for my dissertation.

So, it's not like
a regular book.

Let me know, uh, when would
be a good time to come by ...

It is incontestable,

that the fragments of a work
that have found their way

into the popular memory,

are not jewels
of realist description.

Realist description being,
of course,

what Elliot is most noted for.

But general humanist
observations such as

the much beloved remark
about what lies

on the other side of silence.

This much is no surprise,

jewels of realist description
can hardly be expected

to retain any sense outside
their supporting context.

Indeed...

The relentless particularity
of realism,

the constraint implied
by that very particularity,

is one of its most
defining characteristics.

Bannister's looking
very elegant tonight.

Very... delicate.
Mmm.

Makes you want

to sprinkle butterfly kisses
all over her stomach.

Until she falls asleep.

You know, what I'd really
like to do is dribble

some champagne
down her naked leg

and drink it from between
her toes while having

a jacuzzi with her.

I want to have a contest,

to see who can kiss
the softest.

So um, why aren't you
hovering over there

with the rest of
the ass-kissers?

Bannister
is displeased with me.

I'm way behind.

Tonight I am
to be seen, but not heard.

Hmm.
I understand that.

Hey did um...
Did Margaret

stop by after class today?

Yeah.

Nice. She talk about
her calves again?

She mentioned her calves.
That is so hot.

Why don't girls in my class
just want to sleep

with the other undergrads?

Charlie, I left Little Dorrit
at the old apartment.

W-wait, are we not talking

about Margaret's calves
anymore?

No, I left my Little Dorrit
at Nancy's.

So?

It's my study copy,
my hardcover,

I left it behind
during the move.

So buy another one.

This wine is piss.

I can't!

It had all my notes in it.

Important annotations...
What do you mean?

You wrote in the book?

Yeah.

All of your notes?
No!

Of course not all my notes,
but... uh...

It has a lot of...
I...

...crucial new material.
New, important material

in there, and I decided
to re-arrange things

in a certain way that is
going to affect the entire

...the whole!

So you wrote an outline?

So do it again.
No. It's not just an outline.

It's important.

Call Nancy.
I called her three times today.

Maybe she's really busy.
Busy?!

Doing what?
Huffing Scotchguard?

Taking naps? She's the least
busy person on the planet.

You don't have to
freak out about it.

How am I freaking out,
I'm not freaking out.

What I mean is...
Ah! Hold on, might be her.

No. Text from Jen.

She's going to Donovan's.

Feel like getting a real drink?

Are you fucking kidding me?

Get a room!

Who takes a bath
in the morning?

It's unnatural.

I feel like
utter dog shit.

I might barf in the tub.

At least you don't have to collate
epidemiological studies all day.

Why are you even up?

I need my book.

Paul, it's okay.
You'll get your book.

Why hasn't she called?

It's only been two days.

Try to relax.

But... I can't do anything
without the notes.

The new... argument.
The new material.

Why didn't you type them out?

I didn't need to.
I had everything down.

Besides, hand writing
has a certain...

...ineffable...

Fuck, I don't know.

Oh, I need you to call
CLP and uh,

switch the name
on the electric bill today, ok?

Will you do that?

Yeah.

Get it! Get it!

Mmm.
Ge...

Hello, Nancy?
Nancy?

Shit!

Cold, cold, cold.

It was her. It was her.

I need you to relax, ok Paul?
Voicemail!

Hey Paul, I got your message
and yeah, the book's here.

So, I don't know,
just call me I guess.

Whatever.
She has the book.

Very good. Problem solved.

Nancy, hello. It's Paul.
I got your message.

Uh, thank you so much.
That is so great. I can...

...come and get it,
anytime today or this evening.

Just give me a call.
Thank you. Bye.

Nancy?

We've got squirrels
living in the walls.

The walls are teeming

with rabid, bloodthirsty
squirrels.

You're a squirrel.

I'm not kidding.

They're nesting in the walls.

I heard them.
Squirrels, huh?

I called her four times today.

I left messages. I texted.
And?

And nothing.

So, finally... I got on the bus
and went over there.

You went to Nancy's?
I rang the doorbell,

I knocked, no answer.
But I'm sure I saw movement

in that house.
I know she was home.

Why didn't she
answer the door?

I have no idea.

To torture me,
I guess.

Aw. Nobody's torturing
anybody.

Nancy's kooky,
but she's not malicious.

She's worse than Hitler.

Fucking hillbilly.

Ah!

What?
Ah... ow.

What?
I grated my finger.

Oh god.

I got blood in the cheese.

Listen, how about this:

When does Nancy
work at the restaurant?

Tuesday through Friday.

And Sunday.

Sometimes Saturday.

She works every day?

Not Monday.

Jeez.

Well, why don't you just
text Nancy to bring the book

tomorrow, and I'll pick it up
on my break.

Really?
Sure.

But I mean, I don't...
need you to...

fight my battles for me.

I'm fighting them with you.

Good.

Problem solved.

Nancy?

Jen?

How's it going?

What are you doing here?

Bitch.

I don't understand, is she
 gonna give it back or what?

I have no idea. She was being
a super vague, defensive cunt.

God it's cold.

Uh, did you impress upon her
how important this is to me?

I really don't think she cares
how important it is to you.

Well, what am I supposed
to do? She's never going

call me again. Do I
go to the restaurant?

don't think that's a good idea.

She's already all pissed off
that I showed up.

She's just fucking with us
at this point.

Were you being really mean
to her or something?

What? Jesus Christ! No,
it's not my fault that she's

being so mean.
Don't put this on me!

Well I ...

I don't know what to do.

I mean, they're just notes,
right?

I mean, I'm sure
you'll be able to...

reconstruct them
if you tried.

That's not the point.

The point is, it's my book.

Mine!

I've been
eminently reasonable

but at this point
it amounts to stealing.

She is stealing from me!

Of course it's your book,
nobody's disputing that.

But it seems as if Nancy's
gonna be as big a bitch

about this as she possibly can.

And what's right, isn't
necessarily what's best.

Wouldn't you say?

Break her thumbs.

How long has it been?

Seven and a half days.

Seriously, break her thumbs.

I'm not breaking
Nancy's thumbs.

Fag.

I'm serious.
What do I do about this?

One would one reasonably do
in this situation?

Well for starters you could
stop being such a baby.

Intimidate her, man.

Just tell her you're going
to punch her in the vagina.

She's a freaking little
elf woman.

Just put the pressure on her.

Won't work. Nancy is
insanely stubborn.

This one time, we'd only been
living together a few months,

I told her that if she didn't
was her dishes I was gonna

throw them all out
into the street.

They'd been sitting there
for like a week, stinking,

I was mostly... joking.
You know?

She gets up...

...collects a bunch of plates,
out the sink that belong to her,

she walks outside, and
smashes them in the street.

One at a time. Slowly.
Then she comes back in,

and never says
another word about it.

That's insane.
Yes.

Nancy's insane.
She actually did that?

More or less.

I mean, to be fair,
wasn't that cut and dry, but...

Fuck that! No. Fuckin' bluffing
paper-tiger diva bullshit!

You still have the keys
to her place?

No.

Alright, we're gonna go
get this fuckin' thing.

What?

We're gonna go get
this fuckin' book right now.

This is stupid, come on.

No, what if she isn't home?

Then we have a relaxing drive
around sunny New Haven.

Come on!

It's a little late to go...

Better remorse, than regret,
my friend.

You're ok to drive, right?

Takes money to make money.

I'm gonna roll by.

She's home! She's home!

Wh- Pull over!

Turn off the lights?
What?

Why?
So she can't see us.

We want her to see us.
Just for a second!

Why are you whispering?

I'm not.

I see her, look!
Oh... I'm gonna call her.

She's never gonna answer.

Hello?
Hey!

Who is this?
It's Paul.

Oh.
Hey...

Listen, I'm sorry to bother you,

but I'm right in
the neighborhood,

could I stop by real quick
and get my book?

It's 11:22.
I know...

I'm uh...
P.M!

Yes, I understand
what time it is.

But like I said I'm just
right nearby so if I cou-

I'm not really at home
right now.

What do you mean that
you're not really at home?

It means I'm not available!

Really?

That's strange, because it
looks like your lights are on.

What?!
Listen,

Hey, no... Why don't you
just grab the book,

and I'm coming to the door
in about 30 seconds.

You're looking in my
windows?! Oh my God,

you fucking freak!
Uh, I'm not looking

in your windows. I'm parked
at the curb. This is-

This is the last time
you fucking spy on me, man.

a fucking restraining order,
your fucki-

Hey, Nancy.. n-
Go- Damnit!

What the fuck?

She's freaking out man!

Shit!

What the fuck?
Ahhh!

Agh!

Right, this isn't good.

Nah! She's not
going to answer.

She's not ans-

Nancy! Nanc- ...

Nancy, just give me my book.
Throw it out the window!

I just want...
Give him his fucking book!

Nancy!

Be reasonable!

Just give me my book!

Just go bang on the
fucking door, man.

Don't take this shit!

Why are you just standing there?!

I heard the squirrels last night.

Told you.

It's pretty annoying.

Will you call the landlord?

No... but you can.

And you can also call
CLP today and get the

electric bill switched, okay?

Jen?

Uh...

Last night...

um, Charlie and I...

dropped by Nancy's place.

When?

11:22 p.m.

And?
Uh, didn't really...

You know,
we drove over,

and saw that she was home
and I called and asked

if I could get the book, and...

Well...

In a nutshell she freaked out
and called me a psycho and...

hung up.

Huh.

Wow.

That was ... kinda stupid.

Well I guess that's it then.
I'm really sorry.

Right?

I have to blow my nose.

Right?!

Right what?

That's it, right?

I mean,
you shouldn't have done that.

In retrospect it was
a bad idea, but,

that has nothing to do
with anything,

it's still my book.

She's probably tearing it
into little pieces right now.

I'm sorry but you have to
let this go, it's done!

Dropping by on someone
unannounced is impolite,

I guess, but it's not on a par
with stealing.

Jesus Christ, if you
and Charlie showed up

on my doorstep drunk
in the middle of the night,

I'd be pissed off too!

That has nothing to do
with the fact that she

still has my property!
If she doesn't cooperate

then I'm gonna go
and talk to the cops.

Paul this has gone too far.

I can't support this anymore.

I withdraw my support.

Fine. Um...

You won't hear
another word about it.

Un, deux, trois...

What the fuck...?

Paul!

Hey!
How ya doing?

Jim Pehosky.

Paul Brawley.
Pleased to meet you.

Please have a seat.

So you go to school
with my nephew?

Yeah, Charlie and I,
we're in the same program

at Yale over there.
Right.

How's that treatin' ya?

Oh, fine. Um...
Charlie's a really bright guy.

He does great work.
So...

I hear you're having some
trouble with your roommate.

Former roommate, that's right.
Um...

What happened is, uh...

I moved out a couple
of weeks ago,

and I left something behind
in the old apartment.

What'd you forget?

Um, a book.
A rare book?

No. The book itself
is easily replaceable,

but I had some notes
written in it.

Personal stuff?
No, for my dissertation.

Um, called, uh...

"No Innocent Men:
Structures and Theories

of Penology and Government
in Charle's Dickens'

'Little Dorrit.'

And...you don't need
to know that, but...

I guess uh...
Notes, huh?

They're pretty critical.

Why won't your roommate
give it back?

Does, does he need it
for something?

She, no. She could not
possibly need it for anything.

She's... I think she's just
keeping it out of spite.

What's she got
to be spiteful about?

I've no idea... um...

She's just a...

...preacher of hate,
I think.

This is an ex-girlfriend
of yours?

Not at all.
Just a roommate.

Well, to be honest...

There's nothing much
I can do here.

You just have to try
to reason with her.

But she won't allow that.
She won't talk to me. I'm...

Isn't this stealing?
Isn't this illegal?

Did she say she wouldn't
give you the book back?

No she said I could have it.
Well, then...

But you have to understand.
Paul! The only question here

under the law is, "What can
you prove?" and at this point

all that you can prove is that
she's dickin' you around.

That's not illegal!
No, but...

But it's like she's
holding me hostage.

I need this book
to finish my thesis.

She is singlehandedly
destroying

my academic career!
That's wrong!

What she's doing is wrong!

Isn't it?

Sure.

It's wrong.

Does that make you
fell better?

...the result of choices...

...piece of shit!

You're stupid.

You will...
you will die alone.

What?

What?

What are you doing?
I'm eating.

Did you call CLP and get
the electric bill switched?

No.

So what did you do today?

Nothing.
Nothing?

Nothing.

So how long is this
nothing gonna go on for?

I don't know.

Paul we had a deal.
What?

I'm not working in the hospital
every day because I like it.

I'm just trying to
eat my dinner.

Your funding runs out
in seven months!

Seven and a half.

Paul, you can't just stop!

I know that.
You gonna work tomorrow?

Difficult to say.

Hey.

I said hey, Nancy.

What do you think
I'm going to do?

I just want the book.

Why don't you just go away?

Listen, I'm sorry
about the other night.

I didn't mean to scare you.

You didn't scare me.

I just need my book, okay?

I told you to go away.

'll wait on the steps, I'll wait
across the street if you want

me to, just go inside,
get the book,

throw it out the window,

and you'll never see me again!

Why are you
dragging this out like this?

Why don't you just end it?

Why are you
dragging it out like this?

Why don't you just end it?!

I... What ar... ?!

Look, come on. Um...
Here, I'm gonna stand...

right here while you go in,
and get the book.

How do you know
I haven't thrown it away?

Have you?

Nancy!

I want you to know
that I despise you.

I disliked you the first time
I met you, because

your hair is stringy,
and you smell weird.

But the more I got
to know you,

the more I came
to understand

that there is something
willfully hostile about the way

that you interact with people.

And that all the things that
make you unattractive,

and grating, are the result
of deliberate choices,

and that you make
those choices because you

are a worthless,
despicable shit!

You're stupid and obnoxious!

You're gonna die alone.

Somebody put a dead bird
in my mailbox yesterday.

What?

A dead sparrow.

Pink ribbon around its neck.

In my mailbox.

Why?
Fucked if I know.

Stupid asshole
neighborhood kids

hopped up on Meth.
Fuckers!

Everything's coming apart.

I'm all out of ideas.

Nancy isn't gon-
Shh. Stop.

You... ok.
Just listen to me.

You've been going about
this whole thing

totally the wrong way.

Nancy's a fuckin'
fruit cake!

You can't approach her
like she's a reasonable

human being.
You have to understand

You can reason
with somebody,

who is un...
...reasonable.

You can be as rational,
as reasonable,

as right as you wanna be,
none of that counts for shit

against crazy. You could be
a fuckin' supreme master

of logic and rhetoric,
but crazy bitches...

They don't give a fuck!

Yeah?

I mean, what are you...
What are you saying?

I'm saying it's time
to make a choice.

Choice one:

Accept the book is gone,
smooth things over with Jen,

move on with your life.

And choice two?

Stop dicking around.
Take your book back.

What do you think
I've been trying to do?

No, no. Take...
your book back.

You've been asking
for it... I'm saying:

you show up
on Nancy's doorstep,

with a fuckin' crowbar.

Are you kidding me?
Listen to me.

Do you want your book back?
Or do you want Nancy to win?

I want my book back.

Then it's time to graduate
to Nancy's level.

Degenerate
to Nancy's level.

Semantics.

I found the key.

What?

I found a key to Nancy's.

Why are you whispering?

Because I don't want
to wake up Jen. Listen,

I found a key to Nancy's.
I gave one to Jen

a million years ago
but she never used it

because Nancy would always freak out,
but she's still got it!

Fan-fucking-tastic,
man. Problem solved.

Let yourself in.

Should I? I- I-
I mean...

What are you
talking about?

Of course you should.

But it, it'd still kind of be
breaking and entering.

It's not breaking
and entering.

You're not breaking anything.

What about trespassing?

For fuck's sake,
you have a key!

You lived there
for three years!

Go there, get your shit,
and stop whining about it.

Yeah. I should?
Yes! Do it.

Alright. I'm gonna do it.

Just two minutes.
In and out.

I'm proud
of you buddy.

I'm meeting Charlie
for a drink later.

Sounds pretty incredible.

Can I take the car?

Sure.

Try to stay
out of trouble, alright?

Stop! No! No!

Hello?

Hello?
I need your help please.

There's an intruder
in my house.

There's an intruder

in my house!

I need the police.

I need the police now!

He's in my house
right fucking now!

I don't know!

I don't know!

Get a cop here now!

So how's Jen
handling it?

She's expressing
her support

via icy silence and
frequent door-slamming.

How's your class?

Sick leave last week.
"Sick..."

I start again tomorrow.

So wh- what have
you been doing?

Writing my thesis.

What have you
really been doing?

Daydreaming about
mutilating Nancy.

Like what?

There was one where
she was sitting in a chair

staring at a circular saw...

The saw is on a high speed,
and she's hypnotized

by the blade. Her face
is just inches from it.

And I walk up to her,
all casual...

And nudge the back
of her head,

almost like
an accident.

Her face bounces off
the blade and she falls

onto the floor with
a giant gash. Pukes up blood

all over the place.
Just rivers of it.

And she's not screaming,
cause she can't.

Because of course,
she's choking on the blood

but she would be, if she could.

Wake up.

Paul, wake up!

What?

I made some good.
You should eat something.

I'm not hungry.

You have to eat.

What time is it?

4:30 p.m.

I missed my class.

Did she know it was you?

What?

You said that she knew
it was you in her apartment.

How do you know?

I know.

Did she say your name?

Did you identify yourself?

She knows what I look like.

You said she called
the cops.

She did.
Then why aren't they here?

If she knew it was you,
they'd be here.

Eat some food.
It's just soup.

I'm in the tub.

Come in.

Woah, oh!

What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood.

Where's Jen?

I don't keep track of Jen.

Want a cigarette?

Sure.

What's in the bag?

I ran into a couple
of little girls playing

in the street
on my way over.

Collected their kidneys.

Kidneys?

I'm gonna eat them later.

Oh.

Are you ready?

Can I finish
my cigarette first?

I'm afraid not.

Okay.

So did anybody
read The Aeneid?

Anybody got anything
to say about Virgil?

Russ?

What happened
to your face?

That's okay Russ.

I don't have anything
to say about Virgil either.

Class dismissed.

Class dismissed!

That means "go home."

I'll see you Friday.

Hey I'm gonna go out
with Rachel for a little bit.

I'm gonna take the car,
unless you need it?

No.

Okay,
I'll be back later.

I got you, you bastard.

I'm back!

Shit!

What in God's name
are you doing now?

What? I'm in the bathroom.

I think I might have
eaten something...

Hey.

Hey.

Got you something.

What's this?

What's this?
Open it.

Kind of expected
there to be more notes.

How did you get this?

Doesn't matter.

How did you get this?

I went to Nancy's,
and I let myself in.

You went to Nancy's?
You went in to her house?

God, Jen...

That was so...

Stupid!

Paul.
What if she had been there?

She wasn't there.

And I got your book
and now you have it.

She could have been.
You didn't know.

She is capable
of anything.

I called the restaurant.
She was at work.

I don't know why
you didn't do the same thing.

I...

I...

Where are you going?
Running.

Paul...

Sit down.

I can...

understand why
you're angry.

But you can't
continue like this.

Yes Nancy hurt you.

But you did break
into her apartment.

I didn't break in.
But it's over now.

You have your book.

You have to let this go.

But what about Nancy?

What about Nancy?!
Forget about Nancy.

Nancy's done.
There is nothing

you or I could do
to even the score.

It's over! So now you can
stop being insane!

There was only one thing
to be done, and I did it.

Problem solved!

You think that
this is about the book?

We are so far
beyond that now.

I'm sorry, did you just
actually say that

we're so far beyond that?

You're missing the point!
What is the point?

I got you your fucking book,
what more do you want?!

I want you
to be on my side.

I am on your side.

No...

No you're not.

I wanna help you.

How can I do that?

I don't want your help.

I don't want you to fix me.
I want you to see my position.

I can see your position.

But...
No "buts."

Say "I understand."

I do understand.

But...
30 seconds!

30 seconds of unqualified
empathy is all I want.

If I give you 30 seconds, will
you stop all this nonsense?

I'll give you an hour.

Shit, I'll give you a day. Does
that make you feel better?

All I want is 30 seconds.

Can you do it?

Fine.

Okay.

Go.

Five, six, seven, ei...

Jesus Christ,
this is ridiculous.

I'm not gonna
do this anymore.

God... You look
just awful.

What's going on?

Mmm, I don't know.

I haven't been
sleeping well.

Well, do you
have anything for me?

It's not...

organized properly.

Paul, what is
happening to you?

I've been having...

...complications.

Well, I just need
a little bit more time.

It happens.

I mean it happens
to everyone.

If you do not have
your completed chapters,

go home and gather
what you do have.

Your notes, your drafts,
whatever you've got...

and then come back
this afternoon and we will...

figure out a way to dig you
out of this hole.

But what do you mean?

Go get your materials,
bring them back to me,

and we will figure
a way forward.

I am here to help you.
Um...

Like I said, I'm...

They're, I- I don't...

They're not
properly organized.

So... I don't...

Paul.

What have you been doing
these last two years?

Working.

Okay...

That's it. I have...
done my best.

I will take this up
with the committee.

I had high hopes
for you, Paul.

But you're a waste
of my time.

Are you working?

Uh, I was, but...
Um, you know.

I can take a break
for a minute.

Do you want, um,
want something to drink?

I've got, um...

water, and um...

and I've got... water.
Do you want water?

No, I'm just gonna
stay a minute.

Sure. Um...

Well the offer stands.

Do you uh...

Do you want to sit down?

Uhhhh, yeah. Alright.

So what's going on?

I think Jen
is gonna leave me.

What makes you think that?

Um...

Things have been pretty bad.
And uh...

I'm wondering if I haven't
made a mistake...

Did she say something,
or something?

Well not exactly,
but we've...

I dunno.

Bannister is dropping me.

Did I tell you that? I might
get kicked out of the program.

Wait... What?
Bannister's dropping you?

What do you mean
she's dropping you?

Well she said that I'm
a waste of her time.

That she's not
working with me anymore.

That's not good Paul.

That's really, really,
really not good.

I know that.
Jesus Christ.

But you know
what this means?

Nancy wins again.

Destroys my relationship,
my career, with total impunity.

Jesus Christ. Paul, I-
I can't...

I can't sit here and listen
to another monologue

about Nancy right now.
Okay? I've got...

I've got a deadline
in two days, and I've got

my own advisor
to worry about.

How could somebody
so stupid, be so brilliant?

I can't understand it.
For fuck's sake!

Paul, Nancy is not some kind
of evil super genius!

The only reason she's winning

is because you won't
take responsibility!

Sack up man! Take some
fucking responsibility!

I'm, I... I can't
listen to this anymore!

I've...

You've got a Nancy problem,
you've gotta deal with it.

I've got enough shit to do.
I've got work to do, bro.

Work! I can't listen to this
over and over again.

You're gonna have to
deal with this on your own.

What?

I'm sorry I had
to yell at you.

Just...

Relax for a while. Go,
tak- take some time.

Let things assimilate.

Relax.

Go home.

Talk later?
What? Yes.

Okay.
Goodnight.

Marco Polo.

Hi, is Nancy Hobby
working today?

Your server will be
with you in a moment.

Thank you.

Hey Nancy.
What do you want?

I was thinking
about a cheeseburger.

Oh, don't you usually take
the beverage order first?

What are you
doing here Paul?

I want to talk to you.

What about?

I want to talk to you.

So you keep saying.
Two minutes.

That's all I ask.

We don't have anything
to talk about, Paul.

Oh fuck you.
Alright.

I'm getting
the manager now.

No, wait, wait, wait.

What?
I ...

...wanted to give you...

One hundred dollars
for two minutes of your time.

Then you'll
never see me again.

Okay.

Give me the money.
No.

We have to talk first.

Half up front.
Fine.

Let's go outside.

Can I have my money
now, please?

Jen and I are splitting up
I think. Did you know that?

And I'm getting kicked out
of school.

That sucks.

Yes, it does.

Okay. Well, if that's it, can I
have my other 50 now please?

You've destroyed everything,
Nancy.

Everything.

Are you happy?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

My life is shit!

Is that what you wanted?

It's not my fault
that your girlfriend

broke up with you, and that
you lost your job.

Yes! Yes it is!

Why didn't you give me
my book back?

Your girlfriend
broke up with you

because you didn't have
a book?!

I can't, I...
What you did was wrong!

Fuck you!

You think your life got all
fucked up because

I didn't give you
some book?!

I'm busy, man!

I'm working 60 hours
a week, at this shithole

and you know full well
my mom's still in the hospital.

You think I like spending
all my money on fucking

medical bills for that bitch?!

I do not...

So look, I feel real terrible
that your copy of fucking

Little Dorrit wasn't my
number one priority.

You beat me
with a baseball bat!

Nancy, don't you think
that was a little excessive?

Okay...

Your two minutes are up.

Give me the other $50.

Admit it. Admit your guilt.
Tell me you were wrong.

I'll admit it for another $100.

Ow! Jesus!

Ah!

I'm not gonna take any shit
from you, or anybody!

You think I'm stupid?

Somebody attacks me,
I'm gonna defend myself.

Somebody breaks
into my house,

I'm gonna defend myself!

I'm sick of you Paul!

Give me the other $50.

This was way longer
than two minutes.

I deserve more.
Give me your jacket.

What?

Your jacket.
Give it to me.

Why?
Because I want it.

Nancy! Wait!

Nancy!

All I wanted
was my book back.

How can you not
be to blame?

It doesn't make sense.

Admit it.

You're the one
who's wrong.

Please.

Tell me you were wrong.

Okay Paul.

I was wrong.

I shouldn't have done
what I did.

Does that make
you feel better?
