The time is 1636
right after the Manchu war

China's Army was stationed
in Korea and started to interfere

In Korea's affairs, which made
the people's lives miserable

At this time of disorder, there were
fools living by their own rules

Blood would be all over
everywhere they went

Shame less fools doing anything
for money...

There is no way to find out the truth
about these people

But, people call them
the 'Romantic Warriors'

I took a pity on the poor little thing
<i>Kim Min-jong</i>

and made her my concubine
<i>Choi Sung-guk / Jin Jae-yeong</i>

That ungrateful whore ran away

with another man

I want them captured a live
at all costs

You'll get 5,000 more

<i>Associate Producer - Je Jeong-hun</i>

Oh, gods of the Mountains
the Moon

and the waters

Let us be rid of these demons
<i>Producers - Heo Tae-gu</i>
<i>Yun Je-gyun</i>

Let the evil spirit be exorcised
from this woman

God of heaven and earth!

Let us be rid of these demons

Not there...

<i>Produced by Lee Ji-seung</i>

Who the hell is out there?

Who are these punks?

Oh, no!!

Ah!
Oh, no! Oh my, my...

One stroke could mean ten thousand
Ten thousand strokes, one!

<i>Screenplay and Directed</i>
<i>by Yun Je-gyun</i>

Got any problem with it, punk?

<i>ROMANTIC WARRIORS</i>

I was a top warrior
and her bodyguard

We ran away as far as
Ji-ri San

But I had to face
the 17 best assassins of the nation

in one last stand-off

what her last words were

I 'll never draw
my sword in vain again
