(METAL MUSIC)


Get up, get up.

Fucking fight, huh?!
Damn!

Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

I guess I'll try number three!

Watch it, get him!



Let go! Let go!

Our winner!

(METAL MUSIC FADES OUT)

You got that?
Not of all if it, I...

Okay. I'm going to
collect our money.

I'll give you 10% tomorrow.

Don't even worry about that Champ.

You need the money and
you are good for it,

I trust you. Besides, I made
like, an extra 40 on the fight.

I told you to stop betting.

I know, look, just go
get your money, okay?

Yeah, sure. Say hi to
Maria for me, okay?

Shit! She's gonna kill me.

(ELECTRONIC SOUND IMITATING
A HEART BEATING)

Great fight, Champ!
Great fight tonight!

Thank you, Tony.
I want to talk.

I gotta few ideas,

some things coming up...
You got my money?

Oh yeah, yeah. Right here.

You know I was
thinking that kid, uh,

that Black Scorpion out of Compton.

He's a little vicious bastard but
I think you could take his ass.

Why don't we set that
up for next week?

You're short, Tony.
You're short 40 bucks.

Yeah I know. I had some, uh,
some unexpected expenses

this week. But I'll tell you what,

I'm going to make it
up to you, alright?

Tony, I was really coming about
money, man. I need those 40.

I'll tell you what, kid. I'm
gonna add an additional 20

onto next week, huh?
After the fight.

How's that sound?

Tony... Yeah, yeah okay.
Huh? Let's go have a drink.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

What are you drinking?

Ice. Get me ice, a lot of ice.
Ice?!

You gonna drink ice?
Get me a diet coke, whatever.

Why don't you have a real drink?

Thank you, Tony.

(TONY OPENS A CAN)

<i>Champ Cage the Destroyer Fury</i>

<i>knocked out his
opponent in 3 seconds,</i>

<i>which became the new fasted
time in MMA history.</i>

<i>The UXC is running out of
opponents for the Champ</i>

<i>and the president, John Stone,
is looking for challengers.</i>

Cage Fury, man. World MMA Champion.

It's my dream to fight with him.

Dream? Should be more
like your nightmare.

Let's drink to that.


Hey, pretty boy.

Nice fight tonight.
Thanks.

My boy here, Little Juan, says
you fight like his abuelita.

You know, he's probably right.
You guys have a great night, ok?


I like him. He reminds me
of my little pit-bull.

(INSTRUMENTAL GLUM MUSIC)

(ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATOR)

How are you guys doing?
We're okay.

How'd you do?

Not too good.



Oh thank God.

Thank God is right.

Okay, so we can pay
the electricity bill

tomorrow and the water next week.

You worry too much. I got
it all taken care of.

He's good, he's strong, Hector.

Go to bed, I'll met you there.
Okay.

How are you doing, buddy?

How was your day, baby?
It was okay.

(DEEP EXHALATION)

Look at your face.

Yeah, I'm getting
prettier by the minute.

How did you win?

I got this guy in a
triangle, you know.

When I got him where I need, I
squeezed with all my might.

It was a good fight.

Hector, I know that you love this

and I've never seen
you so happy, but...

But I need to get a real job.

Don't worry, I got a few
interviews tomorrow.

I'll get something.
I know you're trying, baby.


You know, when I'm fighting...

when I'm in there...

just for a moment, you know...

I feel like I'm a winner.

I feel like I'm somebody, you know.

I can take all my pain
and all my anger out.

And right after they raise my hand,

you and Martin immediately
come to my mind.

And I realize right there
how much I love you both.

Baby?

Goodnight, I love you too.

Goodnight, baby.

Maria!

What's happening, baby?

I can't figure out how
to load this thing.

I'm going crazy.

I told you, you have to
treat it like a baby.

Gently and with a lot of love.

IAN: Ahhh...

That special nurse's touch
only you seem to posses.

Alright, let's see
what we got here.

Holy shit!

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

This is the guy I was
telling you about,

he's a superstar in the web

and he's actually a
better than okay fighter.

The Mexican Chavez?

You know, you might be a genius.

He's exactly what
we are looking for.

The Latinos represent 50%
of our pay per view sales.

I told you I'd find somebody.

I can see it now; he's Mexico,

he's America, he's
today, he's tomorrow.

Not just somebody, but a dream.

We can do the fight
on Cinco de Mayo.

I never doubt you, but that's
three weeks away, I mean...

He might not even be in shape.
Listen.

The late choice will build
the drama even higher.

Come on guys, I don't have all day.

I didn't come here
to see this show.

Look, this is the perfect
fight for your boy.

You get a great commission,
three weeks away,

Mexican Independence Day.
Take a look.

Brent, would you put
some salve on my tattoo?

It eases the inflammation.

This guy's an amateur.

That's exactly why he's
the perfect challenger.

He's Hispanic so we
make a lot of money,

and your boy cruises
to another easy fight.

I don't know.
It's the finest fuel

to feed the flame of the myth

of Cage the Destroyer Fury.



Hey, fighter.

Whoa, what happened to your face?

Your wife hit me.
Oh, come on.

How's my little brother doing?

I'm not your little
brother anymore.

I'm 42, I have a wife and a kid.

You're still my little brother.

I want to know why you
haven't come to church?

Isn't it enough Jesus has got you.

Can't you just pray
for the two of us?

No. It doesn't work that way.

Well, too bad brother.

That's why you asked
me to come here?

What do you need?

Why am I here?

I need one of your blessings, ok?

I have a few job interviews and
I need all the help I can get.

Jobs?
Yeah.

You know you always
have my blessing.

But I want to see you on Sunday.

I'll try.
Try.

Well, I'll do my best.

That's good enough. How's
my nephew, Martin?

He's doing good, he's good.

Look, I got to get going.

Okay, okay, okay. Don't
stop because of me.

Hey, hey! What about the blessing?

Okay.

You're good to go. I want
to see you on Sunday.

Or else I'm going to hurt you!

What's that word there?

Start?
Start, that's good.

Keep going.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)
Hang on, baby.

Hello?

Yeah, this is she.

(INSTRUMENTAL SAD MUSIC)

Actually we're gonna be
making that payment today,

and thank you for not
disconnecting it sooner.

Yes, that's correct, and when
is our next payment due?

Yeah, but I'm paying you today.

Listen, my husband and I
have been out of work

the last ten months and we've
been going on every interview

that we could get. If
you could please, maybe

push the payment back by
two weeks or so, yeah?

Well, could I talk
to your supervisor?

Okay, thanks I will.

(INSTRUMENTAL SAD MUSIC FADES OUT)

Excuse me, Dr. Baker,
I am Chavez...

Hi Mr. Chavez.

Well sadly, I don't
have good news for you.

Martin will need another operation.

The surgery we performed
when he was 4 months old

to widen the narrowing
preliminary tracked

to enclose the ventricular
septal defect,

wasn't as successful
as we had hoped.

Plainly, his heart is weakening.

He's going to need another
surgery very soon.

Okay. Thank you.

Hey, baby.

I have to go to an interview.

I'll be right back, ok?
Okay.

I love you.
Miss you already.

Get better.

(DEEP SIGH)

Hi, I'm Gia Chavez.

Oh yes, Mr. White is
ready for you right now.

Thank you.

So in the very first round,
he kicked me right here

and cut this muscle off in half.

I was in so much pain. And I
went through it, you know.

In round first, second, third,
but in the fourth round

when I go to the corner,
your Uncle Jose was there.

I was ready to tell him, "Man,

I throw the towel,
it's too much pain,

I can't take it,
it's not worth it."

And right before I'm
going to say it,

he looks at me and says "You
got this man, I love you."

And I felt like the whole
world was behind me.

And the bell ran and
I turn around and

I see this guy running
at me like a train.

He keeps on coming and I'm waiting

and he's coming and when I get
right in front of him I punch him!

I'll never forget it, he's
flying in slow motion,

lands in the canvas
and I look around and

your Uncle Jose jumps

and hug me and says
"I told you you can do it."

And what I learned from that
is that you never give up.

And you'll never give up.

Cause I'm a champion
and you're a champion.

So you're going to be fine.
You're going to be fine, baby.

Very impressive, Mrs. Chavez.

You seem to be a little
over qualified for the job,

but I think I can
hire you right away.

Thank you, Mr. White.
That's great, thank you.

You seem to really
want to get this job.

Yes, my husband and I have
been out of work for months

and we're up to our neck
in bills and my son is...

Hey, come on.

I've been in difficult
situations too.

I completely understand.

I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.

This job just means the
world to us, thank you.

You have nothing to be
sorry or nervous about.

I want you to know,
if you help me out,

I'll help you out.

I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

Now that's what I want to hear.

How about showing me
your gratitude and

giving me some...
special attention, huh?

You son of a bitch!

My husband is a
fighter and so am I.

Bastard.

<i>The police has informed

(MELANCHOLIC MUSIC)

Hey, Buddy.

Yes sir, what can I do for you?

I have a beauty here for you.

Let me take a look at it.
Look at that.

Oh, yeah that's nice.

How much you asking?
I don't know, maybe 500?

Okay, the best I can
do is 200 dollars.

Look, I really need the money.

I have a sick kid right here.

I'm sorry. 200, that's it.


(CASH REGISTER)

Boss, I'm afraid I
have some bad news.

Spit it out.

Champs last opponent, Ronald Cash,

was found unconscious in his
room and is now in a coma.

Doctor thinks it might be due
to the beating from Cage.

The doctor thinks that maybe

Cash's injuries were caused
by the Champ's punishment.

Let me tell you something about doctors
they don't know each and every thing.

When my mother was pregnant
with me, they said I was a cyst.

They said they had to open her
up and removed me immediately.

Tell our PR department to wait
a respectable couple of hours

and then to announce that
Ultimate Extreme Combat

is going to have a
massive tribute benefit

to show our respect in the
only way that MMA knows how.

I don't know...
Listen,

warriors got to go to
war, the show must go on.

That's gonna cause a
media shit storm.

And we're gonna shy
from the controversy?

That's what puts
butts in the seats.

Shows got to have that narrative
to twirl the turn styles.

And besides, the
Champ's supposed to

never fight again if Cash
doesn't come out of his coma.

Where have you guys been?

We were just in the park having
a great time and missing you.

How was your interview?

Not very good, I don't think
they're gonna ask me back.

That's okay, don't worry.

I sold Dad's gun...

so I was thinking maybe
you and I can...

go out for a nice dinner,
what do you say?

Where were you thinking?
Well, something very fancy.

Maybe, we get a Big Mac
or something like that.

That sounds tempting,
maybe tomorrow.

Okay, tomorrow.

Hey Ian, I haven't seen you in
two days, tomorrow's the fight,

<i>you have to be there, okay?</i>

Hey, Champ.
Ian?

I'm not going to be able to
make the fight tomorrow.

Maria's gonna go be there instead,
everything's gonna be great.

Are you ok?
Yeah, everything is good.

I wish you the best. See you soon.

Like I was saying, you little fuck,

you have three days
to get to 15 grand.

Three fucking days, or you're dead.

Hey, I got to take
care of some business.

You guys wait here for me.
Come on, let's go.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

Where's Tony? We've
been here for an hour.

This guy looks like a crook to me.

He's not a crook,
he's a good friend.

I don't know, Hector.

I'm telling you, I trust this guy.

Hey!

I'm sorry I'm late, I had
some things to take care of.

Great fight though.
Thanks, Tony.

Who's the girl?
She's Ian's girlfriend,

don't worry about it.
Do you have my money?

What's with the attitude?

Come on, take your girl,
we'll g go have a drink.

I don't want a drink.

I want my money, we've
been here for an hour.

I don't have your money right now.

You don't have my money?
Are you fucking kidding me?

You're going to have to wait.

You motherfucker listen to me,
you get me the money now,

I need it now.

Who the hell do you think
you are talking to?

You son of a bitch. Are you
fucking playing with me?

I want my money now!
Roscoe! Jake!

You son of a bitch.

Get the hell out of here.

Let's go.

(SHOUTING IN THE DISTANCE)

I trusted you, motherfucker.


Hey, another great
fight pretty boy.

Although my guy Juan says he
could still kick your ass.

So what do you say
Champ, you ready to go?

Maybe another day, huh?
What happened? You afraid?

Look, I just had a fight.
Another day for sure, huh?

Hey! I'm going to hold
you accountable, okay?


(BOSSA NOVA-LIKE MUSIC)

(BOSSA NOVA-LIKE MUSIC FADES OUT)

Are you Hector Chavez?

Who are you?
Are you Hector Chavez?

Yes, who the fuck are you?
Never mind who I am.

Somebody very important
wants to talk to you.

Mr. Hector Chavez...

Really, very nice to meet you.

I'm a big fan.

My name is John...
John Stone.

Why are you in a
neighborhood like this?

I'm here to make you an offer

I think you'll find both
stimulating and profitable.

And what is that?
How would you like to fight

the champion of the world
in mixed martial arts

in our biggest event ever, the
100 Mixed Martial Arts Colossus

right here, in
beautiful Los Angeles?

Is this a joke?
No, of course not.

Look, you're a big star
in fighting on the web.

And that's how young
people connect these days.

So what would make greater sense

than to bring our biggest
champion against you,

the biggest star of the Internet?

I don't know.
We'd be willing to offer you

$100,000 to say yes.

Maybe that could help you
to get out of this place.

You fight in three weeks
on Cinco de Mayo.

Can talk this over with my wife?

Of course, the wife is very
important to any deal.

Look, I'll give you my card.
I'll expect your call tomorrow.

I really do hope you'll
join us, Mr. Chavez,

I'm sure you'll go far.
Thank you, thank you.

Goodnight, Mr. Chavez.

Wow!

<i>This is the first exclusive
look at Hector Chavez,</i>

<i>the new contender of the

<i>The fight is set to take

<i>in LA, California.</i>

<i>Joining us via satellite is

<i>- Thanks for joining us today.
My pleasure.</i>

<i>Alright, well you have had
a truly amazing career,</i>

<i>You're known as one of the

<i>in all of the MMA</i>

<i>and you've knocked out a total

<i>I mean you truly are the

<i>My predictions for this fight are</i>

<i>I'm gonna send the wetback,

<i>My prediction is war. Death.</i>

I'm sorry.
One second, honey.

Yes?
I'm Hector Chavez,

my son was rushed
here in an emergency.

His name is Martin and
my wife's is Gia Chavez.

Let me check, honey.

I'm sorry, what was your name?

Hector Chavez.
Oh!

Aren't you the guy fighting
in all those videos?

That's why you look so familiar.

Your name's been all over the news.

Did you say all over the news?

Yes, now are you really going
to fight this Cage Fury?

He's a beast, you
better be careful, boy.

Your family is in room 223.
Thanks.

How's he doing?

He has to be operated
on by next week.

It's okay, we're going to be fine.

I got some good news.

That you're going to
fight the Cage Fury?

How did you know?
How do I know?

It's been all over the news,

how could you accept it
without consulting me first?

They did offer me the fight,
but I didn't accept yet.

So everybody is lying, then.

I don't know, baby, maybe
they jumped the gun.

They did offer me the
fight but I told them

I have to talk to you first.

Hector, I've been thinking
about this, and this is crazy.

You've fought 8 times
in the last two months

for a lousy 200 dollars a fight.

Look at your face. He's
going to kill you.

I'm not going to sit here and
watch my son die and you die too.

You have to at least et me try.

I won't be part of
your death, Hector.

Look baby, it's our only way out.

I have a bad feeling
about this fight.

NURSE: Mr. Chavez, wait!

Do you mind signing
an autograph for me?

I'm a big fan of MMA, I love the
sport, I watch every fight.

Of course not.

And that's for Tairrie.
T, A, I, R, R, I, E.

And you can put something like,
"To the Beautiful Nurse."

Okay.
Thank you.

Thank you...
Thank you.

Now you better be careful and
protect that cute little butt.

(MERRY BELL TOLL)


I know I haven't been
here in a while.

A long while.

But I don't know who to turn to.

I need your help.

I need your help badly.

Please, God, tell me what to do.

Hector? I'm back here.

Man, you scared the heck out of me.

Took you long enough
to show up in church.

What is it, one year? Ha.

Is everything okay?
Why are you here?

Well, Martin is in the hospital,
he needs surgery right away.

Listen, they offered
me to fight Cage Fury,

the MMA World Champion,
$100,000 in three weeks.

Whoa.

Of course my wife doesn't want me
to do it, but I have to do it.

It's the only way out for me.

You have to do it. Gia
doesn't want you to?

No.

Well, you have to understand
that she loves you.

She doesn't want to see hurt.

Nobody does Hector.

But you have to do
what you have to do.

And she'll be there
waiting for you.

She'll back you 100%
and I will too, always.

Thank you.

What else did you come to ask me?

I was wondering if you could
help me train for the fight?

Yeah, I'll train you. But you
have to work really hard.

I don't want you to get hurt.

You have to do everything I say.

First you gotta pray.
Yes, sir.

I knew you'd say that.

To you. You know you're a
very attractive woman?

I'm glad you think so.
Do you know what this is?

What?
That's the Virginia state seal.

More presidents come from
Virginia than any other state.

I come from Virginia.
So do I.

That's something we
have in common then.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

Yeah, Mr. Hector Chavez.

Well, that's a very dynamic
decision, Mr. Hector Chavez.

We'll call you tomorrow about
the signing of the agreement.

Congratulations, Challenger.

Your fight is official,
Champ, here here!

Good. I want your guys to get as
much dirt as they can on him.

It must be the fight
of the century.

Consider it done.

I'm gonna take this Mexican
on a ride to hell.

You're so mean, papi.

You're so bad!

Oh God, I'm going to be late.

Uh, babe, hey listen.

I wanted ask you.

Could you just lend me
a little bit of money,

maybe like 300 bucks?

What is it for?
Just some business.

Something came up. You
know I'm good for it.

I'll pay you back.
Look,

you already owe me $1,000

you'd give me it back
three poker games ago.

I know. Babe, this
time it's different.

I can feel it, I can
feel it this time.

I'm going to win! I've
been playing this game

since I was 13 years
old, you gotta trust me,

this is my jackpot, okay?

I promise you I'm going to win.

I don't care about the money.
All I care about is you.

So promise me that this is
going to be the last time.

I promise, Maria. I love you.

Alright, I promise, last time.

Take it.
Thank you.

Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

I shall fear no evil

for Thou art with me always.

Thy rod and Thy staff,

they comfort me.

I believe in God the
Father Almighty,

creator of heaven and earth

and in Jesus Christ,
His only son our Lord.

Not bad, not bad, compadre.

(MANDO: LAUGHING)

Ha.

What do you want?

You finally hit the big times
and you ask me what I want?

What the hell do you want?
Shut up, midget!

I'm not talking to you. When
I say "shit" then you talk.

Yeah, homie,

finally got a big break.

Hope you're not going to
forget your old friends.

Hector!

(IAN STRUGGLES)

Now here is the deal,

I want you to wear our gang
colors on your shorts.

Secondly,

you come work for us now.

Look, Mando,

I never gave you or any of
you guys any trouble, okay?

I always earn my living honestly.

So I'm going to ask
you respectfully

to leave me alone please.

Respectfully?!

This isn't respectfully, bullshit.

Now you listen, and
you listen good!

IAN: Hector!

Drop the gun.
Let him go.

Drop it!
Let him go!

Drop the gun, drop it!

(DOOR OPENS)

What's going on here?

What's going on?

Nothing, Mando just
stopped to say hi.

They're leaving now.

Hello Mando, nice of you
to finally come to church.

Fuck you, priest!
Watch your mouth.

You're in the house of the Lord.

Fuck you, Father. And
fuck Jesus, too.

I told you to watch your mouth.

What's the matter with you guys?

This isn't over, pretty boy.

Stay away from this priest,
you'll get your ass killed.

(TENSE MUSIC)

(TENSE MUSIC TURNS INTO BEEPING)

How are you guys doing?
We're okay. How are you?

Okay. I start training today.

I see.

Mr. and Mrs. Chavez, I have
Martin's latest test results.

I'm afraid he's too weak
to perform the surgery.

We need to build up his immune
system, his red blood cells,

and strengthen his body.

So we want to keep him here
to help him get stronger

and monitor his progress.

Then I think we can perform
the surgery May 5th.

Any problem with that date?

That's the earliest the
surgical team is available.

No, that's ok.

We'll do anything to make sure
the operation is a success.

It's going to cost more money.

You'll have to take it up with
our financial department.

We'll take care of it. Thank
you so much for your time.

Listen, I assure you we
will do everything we can

to get Martin safe and sound.

But you two take
care of each other.

Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

Can we walk out?

Yes.

If we apply for unemployment
we can get $200 a month.

The hospital's financial aid department
can take care of the rest of the bills.

Why don't you let me figure this out first
before you go fighting this monster.

How many times have I told you?

I don't bother others
with my problems.

I want to take care
of my family myself.

I know how proud you are

and you've always taken such
good care of Martin and I,

but sometimes life steps all over
you and leaves you no way out.

And you have to accept
help from other people.

There's nothing wrong with that.

We have a way out
and it's the fight.

Look, I know you're
afraid, so am I, okay?

Then don't do it.
I have to do it.

I have to do it for you.

I have to do it for Martin.

But we're lucky, we have a way out

and it's the fight.

You're gonna have to do
this one on your own.

I'm gonna have to do this alone?

I'm gonna have to do this alone.

I'm never gonna be alone.

You and Martin will
always be within me.

Jose is helping me train.

And for the first time in my life,

there's people that
love my fighting.

You can die giving
people what they love.

There lies Ronald Cash in a
coma he got from the beating

from the guy you are
going to fight.

Hector, is this what
you're asking of us?

Martin an orphan and me a
widow, that's our future?

No, we have to do this.

Maybe this is a way out for us.

People can believe there's
a way out for them.

No Hector, they will wake up everyday
and do that same shit they always do.

Don't do this, please.

Mr. Stone is ready to see you guys.

Mr. Hector Chavez,
how nice to see you.

Nice seeing you, sir.

This is my right hand
man, Steve White.

Good to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

This is my right hand, Ian Raven.

Pleasure, sir. Sir,
good to meet you.

We have your contract ready

Congratulations, Challenger.
Thank you.

And your deposit,
Mr. Chavez. $30,000.

I have to say I'm a
big fan of yours.

Thank you.

There's one caviot, if any pundit

brings up the issue of
your late selection,

we'll just say it was to preserve
the privacy of your family.

Yes, sir.
Let's put on a good show.

How's it feel big guy? 30g's.

I'm going to have to run out
just a minute earlier, ok?

Are you kidding me?
Champ,

you know I wouldn't ask
unless it was important.

You're going to be fine and
kill this thing. We made it!

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome...

to the launch press conference

of the 100th MMA heavy weight
championship of the world event.

This event, we are
so excited about it

because we captured the
attention of LA community

and the hearts and minds of
people all over the world.

Right now, today we
have press from Japan,

Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
Russia, Malaysia, India.

Today we are one world

under the banner of ultimate
extreme combat today.

Give me one.

I'm going to start first with
the undisputed reigning,

physicist of pain,

the heavy weight mixed martial
arts champion of the world.

The indestructible force majeure,

Cage the Destroyer Fury!

And his challenger.

A man hailed by the
Latin-American community

as the people's champion.

Seized from the digital age, up
from the urban ethnic trenches.

Ladies and gentleman, I give you

Hector the Mexican Chavez!

I'm out.

IAN: All in.

Now, please, let the
press conference begin.

Fire up your questions.
Yes, the lady there.

You've had problems finding
an opponent for the Champ,

do you think Mr. Chavez

will pose any sort of a
challenge whatsoever?

Ma'am, we've studied
Mr. Chavez's fights

very, very carefully and

I made my decision based on
what he's already proven,

which is substantial.


Oh, got you.
How's it feel?

Yes, sir.
Mr. Chavez, all due respect,

do you think you have
a shot against him?

Look, I know I have
only a few MMA fights,

but I've been fighting all my life.

And I'd have never
taken this fight,

if I didn't know in my
heart, that I can win it.

What do you have to
say to that, Champ?

I don't care who they
put in front of me,

I'm here to prove I'm
king of this cage.

I'll fight anybody the
organization puts in front of me

and prove I'm the best
MMA fighter of all time.

Mr. Chavez, do you think
you'll even last one round?

I know I can go toe to toe with
the Champ all five rounds.

And I promise you guys a
fight you'll never forget.

Watch what you say, wetback.

I'm going to wipe that
smirk off your face.

When I leave you for dead.

Like your mom and dad left
you and your brother.

Just like you left your
wife and your sick kid.

Just like you left your family
when they needed you most.

No, no. Guys. Leave
it in the ring, boys.

Ladies and gentlemen, the thrills
and chills start right now.

This is ultimate extreme combat.

Coming up.

<i>That was the incredible scene
at the press conference</i>

<i>with the fight scheduled May 5th,</i>

<i>between Hector the Mexican Chavez</i>

<i>and world heavy weight
champion Cage Fury,</i>

<i>who revealed that
Chavez and his brother</i>

<i>had been abandoned as children</i>

<i>and then alleged that Chavez
had left his own family</i>

<i>a wife and sick child,</i>

<i>when they supposedly
needed him the most.</i>

Mom?
Yes, honey?

Did Dad leave us?

No, no baby. That's just
lies from a very bad man.

Your daddy loves us more then ever.

Is Dad going to fight the bad man?

I'm afraid so.

Don't worry Mom, my
Dad is a superhero.

He always wins.
Yes, he does.

(HIP-HOP MUSIC)

Hey, it's your man, Hector Chavez.

Fuck Hector, man.

That dude left his
wife and his sick kid.

Saw on the news last night.

Man, fuck you, Chavez.
I hope Cage whoops your ass...

(HIP-HOP MUSIC FADES OUT)


Come in.

Is the famous Martin Chavez here?

Daddy...

How are you doing, buddy?

Not much, stronger.

I can see that. Let
me see your muscles.

That's pretty good, look at you.

Are you going to fight the bad man?

I'm afraid so.
Can you promise me you'll win?

I promise you I can do my best.

Where's my present for not
telling me about this deal?

Your present?

It's right here with me.

It's my heart.

He's a killing machine.

What's the plan?

Prove his speed and power.

He wants to be as
explosive as he can be.

Like an atomic bomb!

How're you feeling, Champ?
Spectacular.

I want the Champ to knock out
the Mexican in the first round.

We can't look bad.

After all, we're the professionals.

Don't worry, I got it covered.

More hip, Champ, more hip!

I'll tell you, Hector,
it made me sick

listening to him talk all
that garbage about you.

And it's all lies too.

Somebody should stop him.
Yes, we should do that.

He probably hold a
press conference,

clear the air, let people
know what's really going on.

I don't care about what
people think, okay?

I've got nothing to prove.
I know who I am.

Yeah, but...

Champ, people might
start to hate you.

That's bad for business.
He's got a point.

You're the one who always
tells me the truth

always comes out again.
Yes, I said that.

Okay so, why don't we
focus on training?

And we'll do the
talking in the cage.

I like the sound of that.
Ok, so let's train. Come on.

So that Cage, you gotta remember,

he's all muscle. He's
a wrecking machine.

The only way you can
beat him is with speed,

agility and combinations.

That's what we got to focus on.

So I stay out of his reach.

Come and do the damage, and leave.

Cause if he hits you one time,

(DRUM SOUND)

game over.

Yeah, he's a monster.

I'm not fighting the monster,
I'm fighting the man.

I'm pretty sure he has
a weakness. We all do.

Well, find it. Hit it.
Hold it.

(HIP-HOP MUSIC)

(HIP-HOP MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY)

(HECTOR SHOUTS)
IAN: There we go.

Come on, last two rounds.

IAN: Nice. That a'boy.

Yeah, last round! Come on!

Come on, give me everything!

It's for the money.
Give me everything!

Put all there!

You got it!
What a boy!

Looking good.

Alright, good done.

You're right?
Yeah.

Alright guys, I've got to go
see the wife and the kid.

You deserve it.

We're going to stay and watch
the video of Cage, alright?

And study him. Alright?
Got it.

Give them my love.

You did good today, little
brother. You earned it.

It's looking good.
It's looking good.

Yeah, all good.

How long have you guys been
working together, 8 years?

Actually ten.

I was exactly 17

when your brother saved
my ass from a beat down.

Oh yeah? What was that about?

Well, I bet on this mixed
martial arts fight at a bar...

And I won, so I went
to collect my money.

And the guy didn't want to pay.
So I started pushing him.

And he didn't like that very much.

Next thing I know, I look behind me

and the whole bar's
ready to take me down.

If it wasn't for Hector,

I would have had my
ass handed to me.

I mean really.

After that we started talking,
went out and drinking

and teamed up and we've been
running together ever since.

And you stopped betting, right?

Actually, um...

I might have a bit of
a gambling problem.

But hey, you know,
that's ten years.

Ten years man, we made it!

We made it!
That's more than 10 years.

It's more like 30.
30?

Yes, our father started training
us when we were little boys.

He was a Mexican kickboxing champ.

And he worked with us. Hard.

And then, when we were teenagers he
tried to bring us to the US and...

something went down really bad.

We lost both our parents.

We got sent back,

we worked in the strawberry
fields picking strawberries.

We met an old man, an old priest.

He took us in, took care of us.

Eventually, he passed away and...

out of honor for him,

I decided to become a priest.

Man, that's a tough story, padre.

Yeah, but that's not
the worst of it.

IAN: It gets worse?

Yeah, it was really rough
for us when we were little.

Our father was a drunk.

And anytime he'd lose,

he'd take it out on us.

(PUNCHING SOUND)

He would beat the hell
out of all of us.

My mom,

Hector, and me.

For some reason Hector always
took the worst beatings.

He keeps fighting.

A man like that...

deserves success.

Hi, I'm Gia Chavez.

I'm here for the interview
regarding my son's operation.

Just wait a few minutes, our social

Just fill out these forms please.

Okay, thank you.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

Hello? Yes, okay. I'll

Chavez?

Okay baby, I have to go.

No...
I've got this horrible patient

who's driving me crazy.
What does he have?

He just had an operation but

he's so mean that everyone in
the hospital wants him to die.

Why don't you just unplug him?
(LAUGHING)

All my life I've been trying to save
people and now I'm going to kill them?

It was just an idea.
Right.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

Oh shit.

You're very hard to
find, my friend.

Look, I just need more time.

Sorry, time is up.

Man look, I can get you your money.

(SHOUTING AND COUGHING)

Oh shit. Man...

look I can get you your
money, I swear, my fighter!

Wait a second.

Is this your fighter?
Yeah.

You know Hector Chavez?

Yeah, he's my fighter, I've
been trying to tell you.

He's going to win.

From one Jew to another, you
are one lucky motherfucker.

There's a way to make this work
for the good of all of us.

You sure your guy's gonna win?

You wanna bet?

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

And, time!

Good work.

Looking good.

I couldn't find
anything on this Cage.

I think I got something.

You gotta let me do a
little more research.

Take two minutes, go.
Not too much water.

Okay bro.

There you go, Champ.
Nice sprawl. Nice, nice!

(BACKGROUND SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

(LATIN MUSIC COMING FROM THE CAR)

(CAR DOORS SLAMS)

What's happening, ese?
I told you to leave us alone.

The only way that's gonna happen

Little Juan.
Look...

I don't want any trouble, ok?
It's too late.

You're already in trouble.

Stay down!
No way, motherfucker!

IAN: Yeah, Champ, yes!

Shoot that midget!

Shoot him!

Shit, you...

Let's go. Juan, vete.

(ENGINE STARTING)
(LATIN MUSIC)

(CAR GETTING AWAY)

Hey.
Hey, hey, what happened?

Mando and the other guys shot Ian.

Is he going to be okay?

We don't know.

They're operating him
right now, we're waiting.

I have to go to Martin.
Okay, baby.

Go.

You keep me posted, I just
wanted to come and visit Martin.

And see you.

Hector, I think I found a weakness.

I've been watching the videos,

and during one of
his amateur fights

he got hit hard on the left
side of the jaw, fractured it,

that's his achilles heel.

Left side of the jaw?
Yes.

Got it, got it.

I have to ask you something.

I wanted to ask you
this for a long time.

We were little kids,

every time you got
hit you got back up.

Why?

I always got up hoping that the
next time instead of hitting me,

he would hug me, you know?

But he never did.

And I never stood up for you.

It wasn't your fault.

In all the commotion of our lives,

I keep forgetting to tell you

how much I admire you.

And I love you and I always will.

And I admire you.

And I love you too, brother.

We will get through this.

We'll get through this.

Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

I've got a lot of help.
I know.


Mrs. Chavez.

We got the results
we were looking for,

he's strong and ready for
surgery this Friday, May 5th.

I don't know how to
tell you this but,

I don't know how we are
going to pay for it.

It's all taken care of.

Your husband made
the $25,000 deposit

and took care of the payments.

Thank you.

You lose. Strip down, homie.

MANDO: When I was five years
old I was on the streets.

No mother, no father, by myself.

I could have either been
a little street bumbane,

or a king.

I started putting
all this together.

I became el rey.

I need a queen.
(GIRL GIGGLES)

I want you to be my queen.

I don't know if I can.

Yeah, I know you can.

You gotta show me.
I'll show you.


Over and over.

Yeah, and every day.

Get these fucking people
out of here, now!

Everybody, get out of here!

Let's go!


Who is it?

Who is it?
It's Jose, the priest.

It's the fucking priest.
Let him in.

Are you lost, priest?

Hello Mando.

I come here in peace.

I just have a special request.

You leave my brother alone.

He's an example in the
community and a good man.

He almost killed my guy.

I'm sure he was protecting himself.

He wouldn't harm
anybody for nothing.

Please, consider my request.

I'll consider under one condition.

Whatever.

You really beg.

Okay Mando, I'm begging you.

(SHOUTING AND COUGHING)

That's not how you
beg, priest. Now beg!

Mando...

(JOSE GRUNTS)

Please...

(JOSE COUGHS)

Mando, I came here in peace.


Juanito!

Got any forgiveness in you
heart for this priest?

Naw.
Please Mando.

(JOSE SHOUTS)

(BLOOD SPILLING)

(JOSE COUGHS)

I love you, little brother.

Get this priest off my carpet,
he's bleeding all over it.

I guess May 5th is a big
day for the Chavez's, huh?

I guess so.

Are you okay?

All my life...

I was hoping for a
chance to prove that...

I'm a winner and I'm worthy.

And now that time is here.

I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?

Afraid of losing.

Afraid of not being worth it.

Maybe I'm just a regular
nobody and that's that.

Hector, you're already a winner.

You're a great father,

a great husband.

You know, I'll never
forget what you said to me

when we first met, do you remember?

You said, "Everyday

when you wake up and go out
there, do your very best,

so at the end of the day
we'd have no regrets.

So that way when you go to bed
at night you'd have no regrets."

You don't need to win
that fight today,

you just need to do your best
and give it all you've got.

Martin and I will be
here waiting for you.

I've known all my life
that you're a winner.

Today, the whole
world's going to know.

You're pretty and strong too, huh?

I learned from the best.

Finally hit the big time, huh?
About freaking time, baby.

You can text me and let me
know how Martin's doing.

And you should check on Ian, too.

I have to get going.

Thank you for everything.
Thank you.

Go.

Are you Mr. Hector Chavez?
Yes.

Mr. Chavez, I have some bad news.

I'm sorry to say, but your
brother was found dead today.

Remember what King Author said,

"Rise up, defend the

You're a symbol to

Just as I am a river

So defend your people,

I don't see your

Here!

That's an odd choice for a

Onward and upward, sir.
Yes, sir.

Where's Ian?
Maybe he won't make it,

he suffered a cardiac arrest.

He's in intensive care and
his prognosis is very poor.

I'm sorry.
I spoke briefly with him,

he was very weak but he asked
me to tend your corner for him.

It's not a good idea.
Please!

At the sound of the bell, come
on out and handle your business.

You ready to fight?
Handle, let's go!

(PEOPLE SHOUTING AND CHEERING)

Beautiful, exquisite
moves by the Challenger.

His strategy seems to be

to evade, evacuate, shock,
awe, and keep distance.

Well, I do not blame him for that.

Take him out, Champ!

(BOXING RING BELL)

Ow, we are down to the crunch.

(PEOPLE BOOING AND WHISTLING)

HECTOR: I'm okay.

What the hell are you doing?

You're supposed to take

You may really go wrong

I can't.

We were supposed to
be winning this fight.

Our reputation is at stake.

Back off, Stone.

When I get done with you, you won't
be able to manage shoe shine boys.

You can get in here and
blind him with your suit.

I can't see out of my right eye,

the official is coming.
Put your hand on my back

and tell me how many
fingers he holds up.

What?
Just do it.

I'm okay, don't stop the fight.

Okay.

How many fingers am I holding up?

Three, three.

And how about now?
One.

Okay.
Thank you.

Chavez is really making
him work for this one.

Because you always give yourself

unconditionally to everybody else.

And because you're too damn pretty.

Look at your face.

It's getting prettier
by the minute.

Yes it is.

How is he?

The operation was a success.

He's going to be all better.
