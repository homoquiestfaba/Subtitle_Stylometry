True yoga is not about
the shape of your body

but the shape of your life.

This is such fucking bullshit.

These white walls create
such mystical notions.

They are undefinably absolute.

I will take this piece
right here please.

This is such fucking bullshit.

Put the money in the bag!
Put the money in the bag!

Do you wanna play?

Barry loves to play.

Cut.

That was beautiful, Ezra,
truly groundbreaking work.

This is such fucking bullshit.

Fuck you and your pussy board.

This is such fucking bullshit.

Pack your bags!

What's the word, Diamond?

Yeah, I'm just super busy
here at the art gallery.

Yeah, you're about
as busy over there

selling overpriced
sheets of white paper

as I am over here
practicing my Oscar speech.

Daddy has given us
his jet and villa,

we take off tomorrow for an
insta trip you won't forget.

What?
No shit.

That sounds amazing.

Which one of your daddy's
houses are we going to?

Phuket...

Thailand!

Are you sure it's safe there?

Decap Ezra,
of course it's safe.

Now go pack your shit.

Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

See y'all on a G tomorrow.
Diamond out.

Welcome, ladies.

Now where the fuck is Ryder?

Oh, of course.

Nice luggage, Ryder.

Fuck off, Daisy.

Oh you would
love to fuck Daisy.

How do you know I haven't?

Wow, welcome, ladies.

I'm Jasper McDaniel.
I'll be your pilot.

We have good weather,

so we should be arriving
in Phuket on time.

Sit back, relax,
enjoy the flight,

and if you guys need
anything, I'll be up front.

Oh my, I can think
of a few things

that our captain can do to me.

Diamond, just let
him focus on his job,

which is literally making
sure we don't crash and die.

Fuck off.

Oh this is fucking awesome!

Enough of the
chitchat, I want a shot.

God, Daisy, the
sun's barely up.

Well I'm sure the sun
is up in Thailand by now.

And I'm just pro-actively
curing future jet lag.

To sex.

To drugs.

To rock and roll.

I think we should all
go around in a circle

and collectively
set an intention

for our vacay together.

Oh my God, Ezra, stop being
so fucking introspective.

Like, just relax.

Here, take a pull.

I wanna get into some
of that full moon powder

and turn this beach
trip into a ski trip.

Ryder, what about you?

I wanna connect
with my friends,

and have the experience
of a lifetime.

That sounds
pretty fucking lame.

I want to eat great
food, sleep long nights

and fuck anyone I want.

Daddy issues.

My daddy has issues
with you on his plane.

There is the fucking door, Ezra.

Oh my God, chill out.

Well, I intend to fuck on blow

and have an experience
that we'll never forget.

To motherfucking
Thailand, yeah!

I gotta piss.

Oh enjoy.

I'm gonna go up front
to see if there's

anything I can do
for our captain.

Hey, please don't
fuck with him too much.

I wanna get there in one piece.

Ryder, what the fuck?

I thought we could
use some alone time.

Now is not the time.

If not now, then when?

Look, it's not easy, Ryder.

I mean, life is
complicated for some of us.

For some of us.

What's that supposed to mean?

Look, I am not you.

I'm not all confident wrapped
up in this badassness.

Daisy, you have more
badass in you than you know.

Just go.

This is a club I
thought I'd never join.

The Bang Your
Best Friend Club.

The Mile-High, you
asshole.

Get some air in here, Dang.

Knock, knock.

Hello, Diamond.
Everything okay?

Everything's great.

Just thought you could
use some company.

Uh, Dang, I'm
stretching my legs.

Controls are off to you.

Wow, you girls really
know how to trash a plane.

Uh, yeah, I've had plenty
of years of experience.

I believe it.

Mm-hm.
So you know my dad?

Not personally, but I
am a fan of his movies.

Oh, I'm sensing a little bit
of mystery to you, Captain.

Mystery? Me?

My life's pretty boring.

I wish I had something to hide.

Married? Kids?

Oh no, no, no, no, no.
I'm perpetually single.

Mm.

Well, we might have to do
something to change that.

What about you?

Me?

Oh well, that's gonna take
at least a second date.

Do me a favor.
Grab a seat, okay?

Are we there?

<i>Okay, ladies,</i>

<i>we hit some inclement weather.</i>

It's gonna get a
little bumpy, so

if you could please
buckle your seat belts.

We're gonna crash.
We're all gonna die!

Hey, hey, hey, guys,
we're not gonna die.

It's just a storm.

Yeah, a storm we're right
in the fucking middle of.

We're gonna die!

Ryder, I used your toothbrush,
and I never told you.

And, Daisy, I'm sorry I puked
in the back of your car.

Diamond, I'm so sorry,
but I slept with your dad.

You motherfucker!

Technically, she's
a fatherfucker.

What is the matter with it!

I just want you guys to
know how much I love you.

<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>quick little update.</i>

<i>We've hit some bad whether,</i>

<i>and the Phuket Airport</i>
<i>has been shut down,</i>

<i>so we're gonna land</i>
<i>on a private airstrip</i>
<i>outside of town.</i>

<i>There'll be a car waiting for</i>
<i>you, and your bags will follow</i>

<i>and be delivered later today.</i>

<i>Prepare for landing.</i>

No way.

Oh, my God.

So here is the pool, there
is the sea, here is the bar.

Oh my God.

Daddy bought it
like 10 years ago.

so, with a little renovation,
well guys, mi casa, su casa.

Except for Ezra, that is.

Ha ha, sucker.

I mean seriously?

Fuck you. You're sleeping
in the maid's quarters.

Well they always hide the
good booze there anyway.

Cool.
Oh my God.

Here, okay.

I'm not sleeping over there.
I'm sleeping there.

I'm skinny dipping tonight.

You're gonna see my
pale ass in this pool.

Your pale ass?

This is the best ever.

This is fucking amazing.

Yeah, right.

Anyone up for heading into
town to get this party started?

Yeah, thought you'd never ask.

Do they have Uber here?

No need. This place comes
with toys.

This place is so cool.
There's literally fire.

Guys, I'm gonna go get drinks.
Okay.

Forget drinks.
Let's find some blow.

Daisy, you need
to be careful, okay?

You get caught in
Thailand with drugs,

fast forward 15 years,
you're gonna be

like Clare Danes in
Brokedown Palace.

This is Thailand.

Drugs are just as
accessible as rice here.

Just be careful, okay?
Be careful.

That's all I'm saying.

You're the ultimate
buzzkill, okay.

Do you understand that?
I'm good, I'm fine.

Just be careful.

Oh.
Oh!

Shots!

Shots!

Ryder,
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder!

Ryder,
Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder!

Here, here, here, here!

Me, me, here, here, here!

Hey, guys.
Hey.

You enjoying your night here?

Oh you could say that.

Well, I was wondering
if you could help me

with a little something.

Anything you need on the
island, we're your girls.

I need some blow.

We never touch
that shit anymore.

Oh fuck off.

Okay, Ezra, that's
our cue to leave.

Hey, fatherfucker,
we're leaving!

You fucked your dad!

No, don't be silly.
I fucked her dad.

Oh my God.
Oh.

Do you know where Daisy is?

Yeah, she went
in this direction.

Daisy.
Daisy.

Daisy?
Daisy?

Daisy.
Daisy.

She's gone. She's not here.

Where the fuck is she?

Maybe she went
back to the villa.

She has no idea where the
villa is. She must be here.

She's searching from coke.

Ezra, shut up.

Guys, let's just find
her and get outta here.

I'm like done.

Daisy?

Hey, have you seen my friend?

Pink shirt, dreads.

We just saw her walk out with
two big Thai motherfuckers.

You ever heard of
having a girl's back?

So basically I'm
just looking for coke.

Yeah, not the cheap stuff.

Okay, I need the expensive
stuff for me and my friends.

We're not cheap bitches.

Daisy?
Daisy.

Hey, we've been looking for you.

I'm just making a
purchase from these

fine gentlemen right here.

That description seems to
be a slight embellishment.

You girls want some party?
Want some company, uh?

No, we don't wanna
fucking party,

and we don't want your company.

Okay, come on,
let's get a move on.

Let's get the fuck outta here.

But it's still
going on inside?

Daisy, okay, time to go.

Why you be so rude?
We just try to help you out.

Oh, fuck you, assholes.

You're coke dealers,
not missionaries.

Let's go.

Well. Well, we aren't
coke dealers neither.

Now you rich bitches
are gonna give us

all your fucking money.

Look, sirs, you can,
you can have our money.

Okay, but then just
please don't hurt us.

Please don't hurt us.

You guys wanna play?
Let's fucking play.

What's going on here?

Jasper?

Get the fuck out of here!
This ain't your problem.

Oh, I think it is.

Hey,.

We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

Okay.

Remember, you asked for this.

Pressing your nose
where it doesn't belong.

Please, don't shoot, okay.

How did you do that?

I guess I watched too many
of your father's movies.

Well, you know,
we had this covered.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

Look, girls, I know you can
take care of yourselves

but this island
can get dangerous,

especially if you girls
are looking for trouble.

You got something
I can write on?

Here.
Okay.

If you need anything,
that's where I'll be.

Pen and paper? This guy is
so old school fucking cool.

Let's go.
Okay, thank you.

Oh my God.

Who are you, Jasper?

I'm just a lonely pilot
trying to enjoy his layover.

Yeah, well you know,
I watched too many

of my dad's films as well,

and I tend to have a
pretty good read on people.

A simple thank you will do.

Jasper, I don't believe
you. But thank you.

The bags arrived.

Finally, I can get
out of these clothes.

Why, did you like
shit your pants

when your coke deal went south?

Diamond, lay off her.

I am so tired.
Anyone else wanna swim?

Good idea.

Bring the bags to the
room, put on our suits

and meet you back in five.

Uh uh, uh uh uh, I
wasn't fucking kidding.

You're over there.

Fuck
someone's dad once,

it's like you're
a fucking pariah.

Everybody
get out here!

What the fuck?

Don't even freak out
if you forgot a swimsuit.

I have like 20, okay?

No bikini, no
clothes, no nothing.

Holy shit.

Is that real?

I know one way to find out.
Hey.

This bag looks just like mine.

This is nuts, right?

We have to call Jasper.

No, uh-uh.

I'm not quite sure that's
our best move right now.

Our best move?
He just saved our lives.

There is something
off about him.

For all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

You're being
paranoid, Diamond.

Oh, really?

New pilot, first flight,

we know absolutely
nothing about him.

Shows up out of nowhere at the
club when we're in trouble.

I mean, he may have
been following us, guys.

I'm just saying.

You know what?
I say we do one.

We'll have a night.
Call the cops in the morning
to pick it up,

and we just sort
this shit out then.

Just one?
Yeah.

Just one.

No, guys, that
is not a good idea.

Just one.

Okay, just one.

Fuck it.

Okay, start it up.

I'm gonna put this
somewhere safe

so Miss Vacuum over there
doesn't get any ideas.

Let's turn this shit up.

Oh.

Morning, fuckers.

Morning.

I literally feel like
a truck rode over me.

Oh, that can be arranged.

Come on, Diamond, you ever
gonna cut her some slack?

You know it could've been worse.

Yeah? How so?

Well, your dad could have
fallen in love with her,

married her and made
her your evil stepmommy.

And then this
would be my house.

Oh my God, you wish.

Anyway, where's our little
bloodhound?

Did she ever get to bed?

I don't know.
I crashed first.

Mm.

Should we go wake her up?

What is the rush, okay?
Just let her sleep.

God.

We have a big day planned.
No.

Daisy, we're coming for ya!

Yes!

Come on.

Oh my, you bitch!

Holy fuck!

Oh my God. Oh my God,
what are we gonna do?

What are we gonna do?
What is happening?
What is happening?

I told you we shouldn't
have touched the bag.

Fuck! Fuck!

We have to do something.

Diamond, Diamond,
we have to call the cops.

We have to call
the cops, Diamond.

Jasper, we need
to call Jasper.
We need to call your father.

Your father would
know what to do.

Your dad would definitely
know what to do.
Shh.

If we call the cops,
she's dead.

If we call my father,
she's dead.

If we call anyone, she's dead.

We need to handle this.

Diamond.
We need to handle this.

Diamond.

How are we gonna handle this?

I can't even handle it.

Diamond, this isn't one of
your dad's fucking movies.

This is real life.

Get serious.
I am serious.

If what I say isn't
exactly what happens,

then go ahead, call the cops.

What are you talking about?

We're going to get
a call any minute.

Ezra, you're gonna
answer the phone.

Read exactly what I wrote.

And then just, just hang up.

This is not a fucking film.

Answer it.

Answer it.

We have what you want.

But, we also have a very
particular set of skills.

Skills that we've acquired
over the years of our careers.

Skills that make us a
nightmare for people like you.

If you let our friend go now,
that'll be the end of it.

We will not pursue you.

But if you don't,

we will look for you.

We will find you.

And we will kill you.

That was fucking
awesome!

You guys believe me now?

Diamond, what have we
gotten ourselves into?

I know, but fuck this.

We're gonna go save Daisy.

Okay.

Okay, let's just break
down what happened.

When the plane landed, somehow
Ryder's bag got mixed up

with some kind of drug shipment.

Whew.

Now, who could have done this?

There were only two other
people than us on the plane.

But Jasper saved us.

No, for all we know,
he was following us

to find the missing bag.

We can't trust him.
We can't trust anyone.

Okay, they come in last night
looking for their product.

They couldn't find it, so
they take collateral, Daisy.

This is seriously nuts.

We have what they want.

Well, they have what we want.

Who is they?

It's a golden triangle.

What is a golden triangle?

It's the area where
the borders of Laos,

Myanmar and Thailand meet.

One of the world's busiest
drug trafficking regions,

and, guys, we've just
fucked with the balance

of the Thai's drug cartel.

Oh shit! Oh fuck.

Oh my God.

So what's our next move?

They will contact us
and deliver instructions

for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

Likely somewhere in town
with lots of people around.

Diamond, this is all just
like a little bit too much,

but I don't think that growing
up on your dad's movie sets

makes you exactly qualified
or me exactly qualified

to, you know, do a
hostage rescue situation.

Yeah, I'm with her.

You have to believe me.

I know we all love Daisy
and we need her back safe,

but at this point,

the only ones that
are going to be able

to do this are the three of us.

I do have one
question, though.

Yeah, so do I.

Where's the blow?
Where's the cocaine?

Follow me.

What is this?

Panic room.

Okay, so you tell us now
that you have a panic room?

Because this is like
a totally normal thing

that one has in
the house, right?

What up?

This is fucking awesome.

That's a lot of guns.

What is that?

Oh, that's a Replicator.
It's a 3-D printer.

This is fucking badass!

Okay, why does Daddy...

What does your daddy
have one of these?

Uh, because he's rich and
famous and his life has value.

He builds these panic
rooms for us everywhere.

Like, gives him peace of mind.

And here it is.

No one knows about this room.

There is no way of
finding it, tracking it.

It's basically invisible.

Diamond, what are we gonna do?

We're going to town and act
as if nothing has happened.

We don't alert anyone.

They will find us and
deliver instructions

for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

Okay, and then what next?

Then the shit, all gets real.

Who fucking has one of these?

I bail.

There's so many people.

Are you sure this
was a good idea?

Three beers please.

Okay, I'm with Ezra. How are
we gonna do this on our own?

By staying calm.

I'm so stressed out.

Look, if it was just one of us,
we would be in deep shit.

If it was just two of us,
we would be totally fucked.

But the three of us together,

we make up one pretty
fucking lethal weapon.

How do you figure?

We have the brains,
the body and the bimbo.

Go on, yeah.

I have lived every
one of my dad's films.

I know these guys, what
they think, how they plan.

I know their moves
before they do.

I'm the brains.

Ryder, you are the body.

Your years of avoiding
anything in life that

is actually fun and
focusing all your energy

on those extreme sporty things

gives you a leg up
on these cocksuckers.

When we need some
physical action, it's you.

Oh, so that
makes me the bimbo.

And what exactly do
you mean by that?

It means, you're an actor.

You're our voice.

The words we say need to
come convincingly from you.

Yeah, I can do that but I'm
really fucking stressed out.

I'm literally panicking.

Chill.

What did he say?

Fuck do I know?

The boy is saying the
daisies are in full bloom.

No they're not.
They're like wilted.

Buy the flowers.
Buy them now, buy them.

Oh shit.

Uh.

Thank you.
Thank you.

What do we do?

Open it.

Carefully.

Me?

I don't want to.

Could be a bomb.

Shut up.
Just do it.

What is it?

Oh, shit.

Come over.

Turn it on.
No, no. No.

Turn it on carefully.

This here is a banana spider.

It is the most venomous
spider in the world.

There is no antivenom.

So I suggest that
you don't move.

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

<i>Come on, baby.</i>

<i>There we go.</i>

Okay. Listen to me carefully.

<i>Go to the Fountain</i>
<i>Circle at Old Geptown.</i>

<i>There you will see</i>
<i>a big banyan tree.</i>

<i>Be on the bench next</i>
<i>to it tomorrow at noon.</i>

Bring the product, and
I'll bring your friend.

Oh my God. Oh my God.

This is so fucked up.

If anything happens to Daisy,
if anything happens--

She will be fine.

Okay.

She is really strong.

Okay, we're just gonna
follow their instructions and...

by this time tomorrow
Daisy will be back with us

and we can get
the fuck out of here.

She's right.

Let's just get back to the
villa and plan for tomorrow.

Oh my God, Ezra.

I am sorry.
You need to be clear of mind.

Come on.

We need to get
ready for tomorrow.

Always be prepared
for the worst.

Yeah, and what's that?

These guys don't
give a shit about us.

As soon as they get
their stuff back,

we no longer have
any value to them.

We can't trust
anything they say.

They will try to cheat us.

And then what?

Plan B.

What's Plan B?

That is a very good
question I don't have

the answer to right now.

Anyway, tomorrow, Ryder,
you will do the drop.

Ezra and I will find vantage
points where we can see

everything that's going on.

We'll be your eyes and ears.

Eyes and ears.

So what next?

Target practice.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Okay, ladies, now,

the most important thing
when you're firing a gun

is your breath.

Control your breathing
to keep yourself steady.

Take aim through here and
slowly pull the trigger.

You need to be gentle.

Slow. It's the foreplay
before the fuck.

Why doesn't that surprise me?

Years of working on
that bullshit cop show,

and still nothing
to show for it.

Okay, let me make
this easy for you.

Hold the rifle steadily.

Put the butt firmly into
the pocket of your shoulder.

Relax your body.

Aim that little dot where
you want the bullet to go.

And fire.

Okay.

Are you positive that we should
be handling these things?

Like what, what makes
you such an expert

on this, Diamond, like
playing with your dad's toys?

Dad's toys?

Yeah, I suppose so.
Get some sleep, ladies.

Do you think it's
gonna be hot on the roof?

It's showtime.

Yeah, but can we please,
like, be careful?

Yeah, sure.
Whatever, Mom.

What's in the bag?

More toys.

You ready?

Let's go.

She's fucking crazy.

Come to Thailand,
it'll be sick.

It'll be a blast.

Oh Ryder, you're
doing just fine.

<i>Just take a seat on the bench.</i>

<i>You look great, by the way.</i>

Shit, there's a phone here.

What do I do?

Answer it.

<i>Don't speak, just listen.</i>

<i>There's a black van that's</i>

pulling into the
square right now.

<i>Look to your left.</i>

<i>Also, there's a trash</i>
<i>bin beyond the tree.</i>

<i>Drop the duffel</i>
<i>bag into the bin,</i>

and we'll let your friend go.

Something does not feel right.

Ryder, just put the
drugs in the trash bin

<i>and let's get Daisy home.</i>

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

It's not her!

Shit, run!

Okay, let's go.

Stop, stop, stop!

Ah! Fuckers!

We are in way over our heads,

and we need to
call the cops now!

No cops, Ezra.

Diamond's right.

These assholes fucked
with the wrong girls.

Payback's gonna be a bitch.

Okay, tough guy, one problem.
We have no leverage.

They have Daisy and now
they also have the cocaine.

Fuck, she's right.

We're fucking screwed.

Holy shit.

Holy shit.

Yeah, they were never going
to just hand Daisy back to us.

This was always the first
step in getting her back.

That's how I knew it
wasn't Daisy today.

Bold move D-dog,
you gonna tell us or?

I needed you guys
to be convincing.

Okay, I just, I need a break.

I am so stressed out right now.

Wait, if the coke
was here, then--

What was in the
bag I gave them?

Oh, it was just filled with
Ezra's panties, bras and all.

Okay, so are we even now?

Not even.
But we're getting there.

All right, what's next?
Plan B.

What are you thinking?

<i>Of the Thai drug cartel, an</i>
<i>avid supporter of Muay Thai</i>

<i>Koon has been rumored to be</i>
<i>training his prizefighter</i>

<i>known as Goliath in a</i>
<i>completely unconventional way.</i>

Pause it. Pause it,
pause it, pause it.

What are you thinking?

Tomorrow at the fight club,

we're gonna kidnap the head
of Thai's drug cartel.

and trade him for Daisy.

What the fuck?
What the fuck?

You've lost your mind.
You've lost your mind.

No, I'm down.

I'll do whatever it
takes to get Daisy back.

Good to know.
We've gotta start stretching.

Fine, what's the plan?

Ezra, are you still
shooting up that teen tox?

What?

Now and then.

Oh.

Go grab your syringes.

Then go to Daisy's room and
take all of her sleeping pills.

Ryder, you know how to
work that 3-D printer?

Fuck yeah.

Okay, it's time to kiss my
Balmain latex one-piece goodbye.

Why?

Trust me.

Okay, let's go.

Okay.

<i>In our path, he will</i>
<i>be the next undis--</i>

I really hope
you don't expect us

to go out with you tonight.

No. I don't want us to go out.

Great, great.

I'm going out.

What?

I'm seeing Jasper.

Oh.
You really think tonight

is the time for you

to dip your butt
back to the dating pool?

Well, you know, there's
something off about him.

Something he's not telling us.

And you're gonna use your
vagina to get it outta him?

No, babe.

But for all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

So, you know what they say,

keep your friends close but
keep your enemies closer.

Yeah, you know what they
also say? Don't fuck the enemy.

Focus on tomorrow.

Make sure you understand
exactly what needs to be done.

We mess up, we're all dead.

Don't wait up.

Wow.
You clean up nice.

And you barely
cleaned up at all.

Vodka martini,
shaken, not stirred.

So, are you surprised I called?

No.

I'm not.

I'm more surprised you called

and you're not in
some kind of trouble.

Funny.

How's the trip going so far?

Mm, could be better.
Could be worse.

Right.

What about Daisy?

Daisy seemed a little
shaken up the other night.

Daisy, you know, she's Daisy.

Always seems to
get in trouble, but

always finds her way out.

Cheers.

Right.

What's your deal, Diamond?

I feel like there's a lot
going on inside of you that

you don't allow people to see.

There's always more.

Okay, go on.

Look, everyone thinks
growing up in Hollywood,

jumping around the world,

they think this life
is a dream come true.

And in so many ways it is.

But, my mom left
when I was a kid.

One night she just
packed up and was gone.

No goodbyes, nothing.

My dad took it really hard.
He struggled for years.

He put all his
energy into his work,

and nothing else mattered.

Not even me.

I guess work became his drug and

then it was success,
and now it's the girls.

Trying to make him
feel young again.

And, in the midst of all this,

I had to grow up on my own.

Figure out who I really am
and what I really want and

I think I'm still trying.

I think you're doing
a pretty good job.

You wanna take a walk?

Mm-hm.

So, what's your deal, Jasper?

Me?

Yeah, the man
with many questions

and never a single answer.

Um.

There's not really much
glitz and glamor in my life.

I mean...

my parents split
up when I was young

and, careful, my dad
was a New York cop.

Mm?

My mom took
a cushy job in LA and

kinda, just like you,
was fending for my own.

Right?

We had enough to
make ends meet, but

pretty much raised
myself, you know.

Don't know if I did a good job,

but yeah, flying is

the only thing that
made me feel free.

Flying up there, high
above my troubles.

I guess we have more in common

with each other than we thought.

Yeah.

Shit, it's Ryder's bag.

Fucker.

Wow, well that
was a long drink.

Fuck you.

I see what you mean about
keeping the enemies close.

Did you find
anything out at least?

Yeah, I found out
we can't trust Jasper.

Oh, shit.

You have
all the supplies?

Yeah.
You got everything?

Mm-hm.
Everything.

You understand exactly
what we're doing?

Diamond, we're fine.

Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

Another victim
falls to our Goliath.

There is no obstacle
in our path.

He will be the next
undisputed champion.

He is unstoppable.

Another day, and he's
destroyed everyone in sight.

Got time for one more?

A woman?

Here's our buy-in.
Ryder, go get ready.

You just bought a ticket
for your friend's funeral.

Do you have a name?

Diamond.

Just Diamond?

Just Diamond.

And what brings you to
my country, Just Diamond?

I'm here on vacation.

And how has that been so far?

Pretty uneventful.

We'll certainly have
to change that, won't we?

I'm counting on that.

I'll be gracious and
keep all your money.

Tell your friend to go home.

She has nothing to prove.

Perhaps we can get to know
each other a little better.

How about I make
you that same offer?

I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

You found it.

The end is near for your friend.

Shall we double the wager?

Diamond, you shine
bright, but clearly flawed.

I've never lost in anything.

Let's fuck.

What kind of girl
do you think I am?

Ryder, grab your shit
and let's get out of here.

Did you really think you
would leave without me?

Get in.

I thought you'd never ask.

Let's go.

Holy fuck, we did it.

My heart's about to explode.

Guys, this is still
so far from over.

How many sleeping pills did
you shoot him up with?

Enough.

Who the fuck are you, girls?

Do you know who I am?

You just signed your death wish!

Come on, we just want to talk.

Shit.

Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

Don't waste your energy.
You're tied up pretty good.

Where am I?

Where you are doesn't matter.

Where our friend Daisy is does.

What is Daisy?

Daisy is our friend that
your cartel kidnapped.

And I know nothing of this.

You see, that I believe.

But all we wanted was
to come to Phuket,

have a little vacay,
maybe dance a bit,

drink a bit, fuck a bit.

But that just isn't
happening now.

She's right.

We get back to our
villa on our first night

and my shit-for-crap duffel bag

is full of bricks of cocaine.

Somehow your product got
mixed up with our luggage.

And we wake up the next morning

and our friend Daisy is gone.

Silly bitches,
did you not think

that they would
come looking for me?

Oh sweetheart,
of course we did.

We're over here!

Come up here!

Come and get us!

We've kidnapped the head
of the Thai drug cartel,

and he's being held
hostage by three...

Silly, silly bitches!

Oh, you're basically dab
smack in the middle of nowhere.

No one can hear you, and no
one is ever going to find you.

See, we needed
something more valuable

than coke to get her back.

We needed you.

Oh, your boyfriend's here.

You have a boyfriend?

Sorry, man.

I'm gonna go see what he wants.

Jasper?

What are you doing here?

Well you left rather
quickly in the morning,

so I thought I'd
just check up on you.

I'm fine. I'm a big girl.

I don't need anyone
checking in on me.

Diamond, there's something
you should know, okay?

Don't move an inch more.

I will light you up, Jasper,
or whoever the fuck you are.

Diamond, put the
gun down, okay?

Come on. I know you're
involved in all this.

I found Ryder's
bag in your room.

All right, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

I've been watching you girls,

but I know all about
the drugs, okay.

Raise your hands.

I'm with the fucking DEA.

The badge is in my back pocket.

Show me.

Slowly.

What the fuck?

They're using your
father's jet as a mule.

They've been chartering
cocaine in and out

of the golden
triangle for years.

We've got the pilot in custody.

He's been working
with the cartel.

Is my dad involved in this?

No, he's not. He doesn't
know anything about it.

What happened?

We hit some bad air.

Got there a little
bit ahead of schedule.

The plan was to make
another run to the US.

Look, I don't know.

Honestly, I don't know
how the bags got mixed up.

But you knew about Daisy
and her being kidnapped.

I do.

I assumed they would come back
to the villa for the bags.

I didn't think they were
gonna snatch up Daisy.

These are bad fucking dudes.

I'm in too deep with them.
I can't blow my cover.

I do have a contact at the DEA.

He's gonna call the embassy.

Hopefully set up a
rescue team for Daisy.

No, no fucking way.

What?

We've got this covered.

What do you got covered?

This is the Thai drug cartel.

Well now that you've
been honest with me,

I should probably
come clean with you.

What the fuck is this?

That's the head of Thai cartel.

Calm down.

Calm down.

D, this isn't a fucking movie.
You're not Wonder Woman.

Fuck you. Because I'm
a girl, I'm Wonder Woman?

No, I just don't
want you to get hurt.

You actually care, don't you?

Of course I care.

Let's do it like this.
Just give me 24 hours.

If we can't get Daisy
back on our own,

do what you need to do.

But, you know, best-case
scenario, we rescue Daisy,

you get to keep your
cover and we all go back

to our lives before
all this mess.

I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

You've got 24 hours, okay?

Oh wait.

There's one thing I'm
gonna need from you.

Yeah, what's that?

Meet me here tomorrow
morning. I'll explain then.

So cute.

Anyway.

Are you trying to scare me?

Are you kidding me?

Do you not think I've
been tortured before?

Oh, ye of little faith.

Muzzle this fucker.

Oh Ryder, what the fuck?

You're not the
only one with toys.

And it's pink.

Okay.

<i>You think there's a game?</i>

<i>You must not value</i>
<i>your friend's life.</i>

Well, I guess we don't.
So fucking kill her.

<i>Don't push me, little girls.</i>

<i>How do you know she's</i>
<i>not already dead?</i>

Oh, because I
have what you want,

and the only way you're
gonna get it back

is by giving me what I want.

<i>And you think you have</i>
<i>leverage? You don't.</i>

<i>I don't give a fuck</i>
<i>about the coke!</i>

But, Spyder, it's not the
coke that is our leverage.

It's the delivery boy.

<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

Meet me tomorrow at the
Big Buddha Temple, same time.

You wanna see him alive,
you do exactly as I say.

Unmuzzle him.

Do you think you're gonna
leave that place alive?

Oh, who's the fool now?

We have no intention
to ever meet there

or anywhere tomorrow.

Now, you're gonna
tell us where the fuck

your goons are
keeping our friend.

Or what?

You gonna cut off my finger?

Mm, something like that.

Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

and welcome to the stage,

Ezra, aka Dirty Mary!

Listen closely. I am the
big bad motherfucking wolf.

So you're gonna tell
me where Daisy is.

One chance, right now.

Or I'm gonna huff,
and I'm gonna huff

and I'm gonna cut
your fucking dick off.

Ah.

You better think carefully
about your next word.

There's a factory.

Your friend is being held

there.

What else?

We need location, security and
any surprises along the way.

Remember, if we
don't find Daisy,

no one is ever
going to find you.

Snip, snip.

Well, finally my bag's here.

At least I can get outta
these nip clips and minis.

No offense, guys.

Okay, I never, like,
literally never thought

I would ever utter
these words, but, Ryder,

you're gonna need to lend
Ezra and me something to wear.

No.

With pleasure.

All right, what about Koon,
what are we doing with him?

Well for now, he
stays locked away.

No one will find him until
we decide the time is right.

We could still
chop his dick off.

Okay, ladies, let's
get the fuck out of here

and go bring Daisy home.

Let me guess.

No, let me.

Toys.
Toys.

Okay, according to
Koon, we're not far.

The compound should be
just up over this ridge.

Okay,
let's keep it moving.

Diamond?

Diamond?

Jesus Christ.

Diamond, what have you done?

Multiple countries
have tried to bring you

and your family down for years.

Millions of dollars
in resources spent,

and it's gonna be
these three girls

who single-handedly
dismantle the Thai cartel mafia.

How do you feel about that?

Okay, you both
understand the plan?

I extract, you distract.

Daisy, we're coming for ya.

All right, let's move.

Okay, Ryder's in.
Take your position.

Make sure to be ready for us.

We're gonna have to fucking
hightail it out of there.

Diamond, I just want
you to know that I'm sorry.

Ezra, let's just cross this
first bridge for Daisy, okay?

Okay.

Okay, the charge is set.

Charge is set.

Charge set.

Finally, we meet.

Fuck you.

Spare the
impertinence, my darling.

Now, where's Tok Koon?

He's safe.

Safe?

You think you're so
beautiful, so smart.

You think you're a bunch
of American cowgirls,

you're gonna ride in
here and save the day?

I don't think so.

You know why?
Because you're nothing.

You're fucking nothing.

I would think
twice about that.

I got the cocksucker.

Daisy!
Ryder!

Ryder!

Ryder!

Ryder.

Are you okay?

I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

I'm fine.

And what did I tell you?

I am a fucking badass.

Yes, you are.

Daisy, Daisy, I love you.

I fucking love you, Ryder.

Now let's get outta here.
Come on.

We're taking our
friend, and once we do,

Koon will be let
out of our custody.

Why should I believe you?

You will have double-crossed
the head of the cartel,

and you're gonna have a lot
more to be worried about

than just three cowgirls.

You may walk outta here
today, thinking you've won.

You haven't.

'Cause it's not about the ones
who are chasing behind you.

It's about the ones who are
already there ahead of you.

We're gonna find you, catch you,

and we're gonna kill all of you.

Revenge is gonna be sweet juice

that I lick off
your dead bodies.

Drink this.

You asshole.

No!

Oh my God.
Thank God, you're okay.

I'm fine. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

Please tell me you've
done your last line.

Good to see you too, Diamond.

Diamond, no!

Go, go, go!

I was fucking shot.
Oh, fuck!

Hey, you're gonna be fine.

Just keep pressure
on your wound.

Diamond, I'm really
sorry, I'm so sorry.

Screw it.

After this, you can fuck
anyone you want in my family.

Hasta la vista, bitches.

Did they get Ryder?

No, they didn't get Ryder.

That was motherfucking Ryder!

Okay, we're almost there.

Almost where?

God, we've got company.

Daisy, it's time for
a little payback.

Just release the
clip, aim and fire.

You got this, D.

Fuck yeah!

Oh, fuck it hurts!

You're gonna be fine.
I promise you're gonna be fine.

Just take it easy, okay.

I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

It's jammed!

Hold tight, ladies.

Ah.

You almost fucking
got away with it.

You almost rode off
into the sunset.

And what makes you
think we haven't?

Look around you, Cowgirl.

Remember?
I warned you.

You sure did.

Yeehaw, motherfucker.

All right, everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

Get down!
Move! Get down!

Stay down,
motherfucker!

Ladies, welcome aboard.

I'll be your pilot,
Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm.

Was this like the best
girls trip ever or what?

Actually, yes.

By the way, when
did the two of you

start munching on each other?

Diamond, shut up.
They're cute.

I mean, they might be in love.

You're not wrong.

Seriously, for
better or worse,

this is the trip
I'll never forget.

I mean, Ezra just
took a fucking bullet,

repaired her broken
relationship with Diamond,

and Diamond for once in her
life has actually found someone

she likes more than herself.

And I, for once,
can be the real me.

Allow me,
just a little toast.

Yes.

There we go.

Ladies, to an inspiring
group of heroes.

Heroes? Fuck that,
we are Sheroes.

Sheroes!

I just
have one question.

Does anybody got some blow?
