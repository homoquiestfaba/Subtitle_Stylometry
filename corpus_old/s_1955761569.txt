(pleasant orchestral music)

[Patou] Once upon a time,

back before I knew how to tie
my shoes, the sun came up.

Now, I know an everyday sunrise

may not seem like such a
big deal to some folks.

But, imagine for a moment,

if instead of rising up like this,

one morning where you lived,

she took a look around and
decided to go back to sleep.

It happened once to us.

Let me tell you all about it.

â™« Cock-a-doo

â™« Hoo hoo hoo hoo

â™« Whoa

â™« Ohdeohdelayhee hee

â™« Cock-a-doo, what a day

â™« The sun is shining brightly

â™« Cock-a-doo, sunny day

â™« Down here on the farm

â™« Cock-a-doo, stay away

â™« You big ol' wet ol' rain cloud

â™« Or I'll cry out loud

â™« With this voice of mine

[Patou] This was our
rooster, Chanticleer.

And though it was true that
he like to horse around some,

fact was, that boy could sing.

â™« Sun do shine

â™« Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

â™« Well, my daddy taught me how to sing,

â™« And that's why this
voice means everything

â™« Sun do shine

[Patou] We all had our jobs on the farm,

and Chanticleer's was to wake up the sun.

And when he crowed, up she came.

â™« Let it shine, let it shine

â™« Let it shine

[Patou] Hey, look,
here's me tying my shoes.

Hi, Patou, what you doin'?

I'm trying to tie these doggone shoes.

(laughs) Again?

(chickens clucking)

Well, hi ladies.

Oh, he's so handsome.

[Hen In Polka Dots] Sings like a dream.

He's a dream.

And he's single, too.

[Patou] He maybe wasn't the
smartest bird that ever lived,

but when he crowed, there was
plenty of peace and harmony.

Hey!

[Patou] Well, plenty of harmony, anyway.

And lots of sunshine.

â™« Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

â™« And that's why this
voice means everything

â™« Sun do shine, you
better shine, better shine

â™« Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

â™« You better shine

â™« You better shine, sun, you better shine

â™« Digidigidigidowdow


[Patou] There was no doubt about it.

Old Chanticleer kept us
animals up and shining.

[All] Good day, Mr. Chanticleer.

[Patou] But all that
was about to change.

One morning, before
Chanticleer was even awake.

Hey, Chanticleer.

[Patou] A stranger snuck onto our farm

to stop Chanticleer from crowing.

Of course, Chanticleer wouldn't
give up without a fight.

But what he didn't know

was that this stranger had been sent

by the Grand Duke of Owls.

Nasty fella.


The good news here was that
Chanticleer had won the fight.

The bad news was, the Grand Duke's bully

had done his dirty deed,
for in all the commotion

Chanticleer had plum forgot to crow.

And the sun was comin' up without him.


When Chanticleer saw
this, it broke his heart.

He reckoned maybe his crow
never did raise the sun.

Look, it's comin' up without him.

You're a phony.

He's a fake!

Hey, everybody, cock-a-doodle-doo!


[Patou] The Grand Duke's
evil plan had worked.

He had turned us against
our very best friend.

And without a reason to
crow, poor Chanticleer

left the farm to look
for work in the city.

Then came the rain, and
our troubles with the Duke.

[Edmond] Who's that, Mom?

That's the Grand Duke.

He's the one who's
causing all the trouble.

He sent that mean old rooster

to Chanticleer's farm to pick a fight.

Hm, how come?

Because he didn't like
Chanticleer doing all that crowing

and bringing up the sun.

How come?

Well, like most owls, he
likes the darkness and the rain.

I'm not afraid of the dark.


Oh, it's you.

You scared me!

Dory, we got big problems.

Have you looked out there?

If that rain doesn't stop,

we're all gonna go
floatin' down the river.

[Patou] This is my
favorite part of the story.

His name is Edmond, of course

he didn't look quite like
this when I first met him.

Anyhow, we weren't the only
folks having our troubles.

Poor Edmond's family was
having their share too.

[Father] The river's widened too fast,

we gotta reinforce the sandbags.

[Mother] Oh, you think that'll work?

[Father] We'll make it work.

I'll get the boys.

Me too!

You stop right there.

Aw Mom, I'm one of the boys.

He meant the big boys.

I'm big enough.

Not yet you're not, darling.

[Radio] The U.S. Weather
Bureau is expecting

yet another--


Downpour in the areas worst
hit by this week's flooding.

[Older Boy] Dad, Mom, come on,

bring the stuff around to the front.

[Radio] Governor Dale declared

a state of national emergency--

Come on, guys, move it.

I need some help, we've
gotta get the animals inside.

[Patou] So while Scott and Mark

got to help protect the
house against the flood,

poor Edmond was left behind where

he'd be safe and out of trouble.

It's my house too, I wanna help.

Well then, pray for the rain
to stop, and that'll help.

[Father] Dory, I can't
find the flashlight!

Coming!

Now you stay here where
it's safe, pumpkin.

I'm gonna help your father
and I'll be right back.

[Older Boy] Come on, dad.

[Father] Great, let's go!

Hey Dad, they said on the radio

the National Guard might come.

I am too a big boy.

"And without a reason to crow,
Chanticleer left the farm.

"Then came the rain."


Mom, here!

How is she, Frank?

Just start the truck, she'll be okay.

Hey, hey!

I know what we need here.

We need Chanticleer.


(water rushing)


Mom!

Boys, the levee's breaking!

Chanticleer!

Chanticleer!


[Patou] Edmond had the right
idea to call for Chanticleer,

but he never coulda guessed
who was gonna answer.

(heavy footsteps)

Chanticleer?

No, it's not Chanticleer.

Who...

Who are you?

You put your finger in
the Duke's face, remember?

These are expensive, brat!

But that is not why the
Duke is going to eat you.

Eat me?

Oh dear, now I've gone
and spoiled the surprise.

Oh, always doing that.

But you see, we creatures of the night

have worked very hard
to make absolutely sure

that that bird does not return.

You, you, with no regard
for the feelings of others,

had the nerve to call
him back here by name!

And besides, I positively
loathe rock and roll.

(laughing maniacally)

You're not gonna eat me!

[Patou] And that's when
the Duke hit the ceiling.

If Edmond wanted to bring
Chanticleer back to raise the sun,

the Duke was gonna have
somethin' to say about it.

Kittens are more digestible.

[Patou] Young Edmond was about to have

the most amazing adventure
he'd ever dreamed of.


(evil laughter)

Mom, Dad, wake me up!

[Patou] This is where I come in.



You'll pay for this, Patou!

This does not concern you.

It does if it's about Chant--

The light, the owls hate the light!

(+screams)

Whew.

Hey, hey boy.

We were this close.

Oh, that flashlight biz was
quick thinking on your part.

What's your name, little fella?

Edmond.

Is he gone?

Yeah, he's gone, but he'll be back

and he won't be alone, the coward.

I woulda whopped him if
I'da had my shoes tied.

But you know something, tying shoes

is harder than dry dog food.

Whatcha wearing shoes for?

Bunions.

I got a load of bunions,
and them shoes help my feet.

Here, let me show you how to tie 'em.


Jeepers, I'm all furry!

Well, kittens are furry.

But, but, I'm a little boy.

(yowling scream)


Did that come outta me?

I'm, I'm a cat, he turned me into a cat!

Help me, do something!

I can't be a cat, I'm a boy!

Patou, what'll I do?

Alright, steady boy, keep your pants on.


Yuck!

What am I doing, I'm licking myself.


[Peepers] Patou!

I'm in here.

By my calculations, this
can't possibly be the city.

Let's see. 367 southeast...

Or is it 676?



It's okay Peepers, it's Edmond.

He's a nice kitty.

I'm a boy!

And I almost ate a mouse.

I must be crazy.

You bet your sweet whiskers.

Wow.

Ain't no city around here.

Oh, sadness.

Hey, aren't you gonna tie my shoes?

I can't, I can't help anybody.

I'm too little.

I'm a scrawny furball runt.

Mom and Dad won't even recognize me!

Mom, Dad, help!


Oh, Chanticleer.

What?

If he doesn't come back and crow soon,

it won't shine again and the
rain will keep coming down

and the water will get higher and higher

'til, 'til...

We all drown.

Wowie wow wow wow wow!

Are we close, are we near the city?

Us magpies are just made for the city.

Come on already, hurry up, Peepers!

We are not looking for the city.

We are looking for Chanticleer.

Well he's in the city, isn't he?

Then he is in the city.

Girls, they think they know everything.

Why don't you run home, be
a mousewife, make cheese.

Snipes, you think you're so superior.

"Thuperior."

Nice lisp.

My lisp isolates and elevates me,

and makes me a rare specimen.

Ah, this is flippin' garbage!


Pipe down, you two.

The story's true!

You all laughed at him and he went away.

You're right, son.

We done wrong, and that's why
we're searchin' for the city.

We gotta find Chanti and apologize.

Then he'll forgive us...

Come home...

[Chicks] And raise the sun!

Well, I know where the city is.

I've been there lots of times as a boy.

A boy?

Before that big owl
turned me into a cat!

Owl?


Edmond, would you take us to the city?

I can't.

Look at me, I'm a cat.

No, a little kitty.

What can I do?

I can do lots of things, and
I'm a lot smaller than you.

And furthermore, I could
forgive you for being a cat

if you would take us to the city.

Of course, if you're a fraidy-cat...

I'm not afraid!

Or like, a scaredy-cat...

Me, scared?
Hey, guys...

Lay off the boy.

Hey, hey guys...

Okay, okay!

I'm not afraid of anything.

I'll take you to the city
and find Chanticleer.

(animals laughing)

And bring him home, and save
Dad and Mom and the farm.

Alright, hope you can swim, guys.

[Edmond] Oh no!


We don't have to swim,

we'll go by boat.

Oh, this is serious.

Peepers, you'll need
this if those owls return.

Here!

Owls?

I'm sticking with you.

Well fellas, this is it.


[Snipes] The city!

The lights, the chicks, the food.

Bye, good luck with the owls!

Owls?



[Patou] Yep, owls.

While Edmond set our course
for the city in the USS Toybox,

the Duke and his owls
were back in their lair

stirrin' up some powerful nasty weather.

(low organ music)

So he turns on the Duke, and with what

do you suppose he turns on the Duke?

[All] What, Master?

A flashlight!

â™« What a horrible thing to do

â™« â™« What a horrible thing to do

â™« Thing to doooo

But then, when my back is turned,

what four-legged flea-bitten louse

comes sneaking through the window

and has the nerve to bite me on the leg?

â™« Who, who, who, who, who?

Who?
Patou.


Yes!

â™« Patou, Patou

Destroy the farm,
destroy the cat, the dog,

or do you want the chicken back?

â™« No, we hate the sun

â™« The answer's noooo

It'll make my leg feel so much better

if that rooster never crows!

(laughs maniacally)

â™« We hate the sun

â™« That much we know

Rain!

â™« We hate the rooster.
we'll never let it crow

Never let him crow!

â™« We hate the sun

â™« From head to toe

From head to toe!

â™« We hate the rooster,
we'll never let it crow.

â™« Never let it crow

Never let it crow.


Aaahhh!

Uncle Dukey, Uncle Dukey.


I wish you wouldn't do that.

Hunch, I told you never to call me that.

Yes, sir.

No sir, sir.

But guess what I just saw,

Patou the dog floating in
a toybox down the river,

and he has this cute little
white kitty with him--


Hunch, my little pygmy nephew.

Come to your uncle.

(jumbled organ notes)

Ah!

[Patou] Meanwhile, bound for the city,

Edmond steered us through the
perils of the flooded river.

[Peepers] Starboard ho!

[Snipes] Starboard who?

Left or right?

[Edmond] Uh-oh.

Giant tree, a hundred feet and closing!

Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

We need wind power!

40 feet!

Well guys, I-I think
I'm slowing you down.

Yeah, I'll see you later, guys.

30 feet!

Ahh!

Come on, Patou, pull on this.

It worked!
Turn now!


This is the right way, guys!

(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

Okay guys, you heard the Duke.

Total and complete, oh-ho, annihilation.

Bombs away!

Aah!

Hey!

Bombs away, bombs away!

Edmond, grab ahold!

Ooh ho ho, gotcha--

Oow!

Get my camera!

Huh?

What does he want with a camera?

Get that camera.

Ooh, I gotcha, kitty.

Put me down!


Say cheese!

Oooh!

Ha ha, we got 'em.

Uh-oh...

Oh no!
Get the lid.

Ahah, adequate pipe.

L-Let me outta here.

I can't breathe!

Help, I need air.

What's wrong with him?

He's claustrophobic.

Teeny-weeny tight spaces
make him very, very nervous.

Uh-oh.

Uh-oh!

Get him away from the lid.

Help, we're trapped,
we're trapped like rats.

We're trapped, we're
trapped, we're trapped.

Trapped like rats...

Come back here, you crazy bird.

Now settle down, you're rockin' the boat.

I can't breathe...

Don't make me lose my temper, Snipes.

I need air, I don't wanna swim.

Mommy, we're trapped Mommy!

Settle down.

Patou!
Oh, no.

Aah!


That was close.

Mercy.

Oh no!

[Peepers] Abandon ship, abandon ship!


(coughing and spluttering)

What's that smell?

Garbage.

Ah, this is pathetic.

I risk my life and what do I get?

Garbage!

Why, I've never been so--

Wow!

The city!

Wow!

It's so beautiful.

Now, all we got to
do is find Chanticleer

and that's gonna be like hunting
for a needle in a haystack.



Ow!

Uncle Dukey, Uncle Dukey!

I got 'em.

If I killed my nephew, would
that be murder or charity?

I got 'em, I really got 'em!

No more kitty, sir.

Mission, oohoh, accomplished.

And the dog?

Gone, wiped out, sir.

Total and complete, ohoh, annihilation.

Annihilation.

How did you do it?

Adequately.

Ahe--

Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

Well, Uncle, we sucked
them into an adequate pipe.

A what?

That's what it said.

"Danger, adequate pipe."

Oh, dear.

Come to Uncle.

Aaah.

You imbecile!

That's not an adequate
pipe, it's an aqueduct pipe!

It leads straight into the city!


The Duke gives you one last chance, Hunch.

Them or you.

Get to the city!

Oh, not the city, sir.

Oh no.

It's too bright, I'll go blind.

Oh, say it isn't so.

Chamer, Chanta, Chantilly, Chantz.

He's not in here.

Let's go.

[Patou] You ever get
that feeling when you're

;ookin' for something that
it's right under your sniffer?

I know it seems crazy,
but it was almost like

we could hear his voice calling to us.

You know, like he was just waiting

for us to come and ask him back.

But we looked everywhere,
and we talked with everyone,

but nobody had heard
of Chanticleer, nobody.

Funny thing was, he was right
under our nose the whole time.

Or should I say, we were under his.

No, Patou, that's not how it goes.

For the hundredth time, it's over, around,

under and through, that's
how Patou ties his shoe.

Now you say it.


Ooh, there you are!

Pilot to bombardier, enemy target below!

I'm going in for a closer look, cover me!

(makes vroom noises)


What was that?


Complete attrocitation.

Alright you guys, we've
left it long enough.

They're counting on us back at the farm.

Well, if you ask me--

We didn't.

Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

What?

It's him!

[Snipes] Who?

[Peepers] No wonder
we couldn't find him,

he's changed his name.

[Patou] Chanticleer is the King?

[Edmond] The King?

[Patou] Ooh, your Highness.

[Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen, the King!

[Patou] Old Chanticleer
may have stopped crowin'

but he hadn't stopped
using that voice of his.

â™« Let me be your rooster

â™« And let me roost with you


â™« Let me be your rooster

â™« Let me hear your sweet voice coo

â™« Girl, you've thrown me for a loop

â™« You're the number one
chick in this chicken coop

[Patou] Chanticleer had become a star.

â™« I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the day is through

â™« I want to rock,
rock-a-doodle-doo tonight

â™« I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the morning light

â™« Well it ain't right to rock alone

â™« It takes two, I do believe

â™« I'm gonna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

â™« To you

â™« Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

â™« I'm gonna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

â™« To you

â™« Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

â™« Rock-a-doodle-doodle

[Patou] But not
everybody liked the King.

Goldie here was jealous of him.

Less my manager's fee of 60%.

Look, Pinky, I just have to know when.

Oooh, Goldie, will you not
bother me with this right now?

You've gotta go on in two minutes.

But I'm too good for the chorus.

What's he got that I ain't got?

A voice.

â™« I wanna rock, rock-a-doodle
through the night

â™« I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the morning light

[Patou] Fortunately
for us, Goldie was a lot

smarter than she sounded,
and a lot nicer too.

She just didn't know it yet.

â™« Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

â™« Rock-a-doodle, rock-a-doodle,
rock-a-doodle-doo to me

Lookie, Goldie, when I
found him, he was a nobody.

Nobody wanted him, nobody cared about him,

but I picked him up out of the gutter

and now look at him.

â™« Well it ain't right to rock alone

Everybody starts in the chorus. Goldie.

Of course, you could
give up show business.

Pinky!

â™« I wanna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

â™« Just like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

Thank you, thank you very much.

I love you, I love you.

(audience cheering)

[Edmond] Now that we found him,

how do we get in to see him?

[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

the King is leaving the building.

Ow!

Out of the way!

Move it, move it, move it!

Don't touch the frogs.

â™« Try it, you won't get very far

â™« We'll bounce you once, bounce you twice

â™« If you get out of
line, we're not very nice

â™« We'll bounce, bounce
you all over the place

â™« Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce,
if we don't like your face

Get away from the star!

[Patou] Chanticleer was a star alright,

but it's hard to be happy without friends

even if you are famous.

I reckon he'd be awfully glad to see us,

if we could just figure
a way to get near him.

Aggravation.

You were fantastic tonight, really!

What can I get for ya, kid?

You name it, anything

You want a beach house in Maui?

Ooh, I'll buy you the whole island.

Cars, yachts, what?

Name it, it's yours.

Ah, thanks.

Say, what's eatin' you?

Well, I...

Well, I just don't know.

I guess I'm just a little
lonely, that's all.

Lonely?

Are you crazy?

There's 20,000 people out
there screaming your name

and you're lonely?

(glass breaking)

I love this guy.

Yeah, but back on the farm...

Hey, you told me yourself
what they did to ya on the farm.

They don't love you.

Murray, give us a roll.

See that?

They love you, eh?

You were incredible.

Mm-mm-mm, the King!

Murray, get us outta here.

Hello, Goldie?

How'd you like to get out of the chorus?

[Patou] Meanwhile, back on the farm...


She's fading fast.

How many more batteries have we got?

Just these two.

Oh, sadness.

(phone ringing)


Whoa, sorry ma'am.

Who is it, who is it?

What do you want?

We've got an emergency here.

Yeah, yeah, Edmond?

Anybody here named Edmond?

I'm Edmond!

The little boy who--

I mean, the kitty.

Who's this?

Stuey, Stuey the pig.

It's the kitty!

Stuey, the light's going out.

The lights are going out,
the lights are going out!

Kitty, look, we're
running out of time here.

We need Chanticleer, quick!

We'll be there as soon as we can!

Stuey!

Yeah, yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.

Sorry kitty, gotta go, gotta go.


Stuey, what about my family?

Are they alright?

Soeey, Soeey?

Stuey!


Hello, kitty?

It's the Duke.

I have some rather bad news, I'm afraid.

When the batteries expire,
so will your friends.

Toodle-oo, cheerio, bye.

[operator[ The Number You Have dialed

is no longer in service.

Oh no!

â™« Twiddley-dee

â™« They're running out

â™« They're running out of batteries

â™« Of batteries

â™« Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-ha

â™« No batteries

(tires screeching)

Yeah?

Oh howdy, boss, how are you?

Uh-huh, huh?

Did you say a cat, a
dog, a bird and a mouse?

What is this?


Some kinda joke, huh?

Well I don't think it's funny, Pinky.

they want to bring
Chanticleer back to the farm.

You don't want that, he
makes you lots of money.

I don't want that, he makes me miserable.

[Pinky] Right boss,
what should I do about it?

Your chicken thinks they
don't want him on the farm.

That's good.

All you have to do is make
sure he keeps thinking that.

It's not good that the
kitty and his friends

should talk to your chicken, capice?

Yeah, thanks a million.

This has been most enlightening.

Penguin suits, two for a dollar.

You wanna see the King, come
and get your penguin suits.

Remember, no dogs, cats, birds or meeses.

"Dear Chanticleer, we're sorry.

"Come home, your friends."

Here guys, come on, sign this.

Here.

Must you bother me whilst I dine?

Snipes, sign this.

Oh heavens.

Where have you been all my life?

Lasagna a la pasta.

Just sign it.

Ah, sure.

Excuse me, sir, would you please

see that the King gets this?

Yeah, it's really important.

Oh, and waiter?

We asked for light cola,
this stuff weighs a ton!

Hmm.

Get me the boss.

It sounds bad, Pinky.

It's only a little bad, not a big bad.

Look, he's lonely, he needs a friend.

And that bad little kitty
wants to steal him away.

You don't want that, do ya?

[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

Pinky's Palace proudly presents the King!

Thank you, thank you very much.


[Patou] Would you look at that.

Chanticleer?

â™« Well down in Tupelo

â™« I was so alone

â™« I never had no money to
have no honey for my own

â™« That's why I'm treasure hunting

â™« Whaa-Oo

â™« Treasure hunting for my love

â™« He's treasure hunting for his love

â™« Well I've been everywhere,
searching high and low

â™« But I ain't found no rainbow
yet that had a pot of gold

â™« Well, I'm treasure hunting

You know, I think he died of fear.

Hey, what are you doing little fella?

Something I learned in school.

Cats don't go to school.

But boys do.

Hey!

You boys is dead meat.

Chanticleer!

â™« Good King Neptune said
he'd help me find my treasure

â™« Far below the sea

â™« He introduced me to
every single purty mermaid

Patou!

â™« So I keep treasure hunting

Do you promise no one gets hurt?

No one gets hurt.

You just do the number, make him happy

and keep him away from
that bad little kitty!

â™« Treasure hunting for my love

â™« He's treasure hunting for his love

Hey, there's no lobsters in this number.

Get them outta here!

Wait a minute, don't spoil the show, huh?

â™« That treasure's all I'm thinking of

â™« Thinking of, thinking of, thinking of

â™« Well I got treasure hunting fever

â™« Yeah-Ya

â™« Well I got treasure hunting fever

â™« Yeah-Ya

â™« â™« Well I got treasure hunting fever

â™« Yeah-Ya

â™« Well I got treasure hunting fever

â™« For love

â™« Treasure hunting fever

â™« Yeah I got treasure hunting fever

â™« For love


Now.

â™« Deep deep, the trouble you're in

â™« I've thrown you to the
sharks and you can't swim

Oh no.

Well, you can take the
rooster out of the country

but you can't take the
country out of the rooster.

Old Chanticleer had found
himself a city perch

sorta tailored to remind him
of the farm he'd left behind.

Trouble was, with Goldie on the scene

he wasn't feelin' so
lonesome for us anymore,

which was exactly the way Pinky wanted it.

'Cause that was exactly the
way the Grand Duke wanted it.

There was just one problem
with their plan, of course.

Goldie was only supposed to pretend

to fall in love with Chanticleer,

but she was falling in love for real

and that can really change a pheasant.

â™« Love has said hello, you don't know

â™« What that means, really means to me

Ooooh, I think we've lost him.

What do you mean?

He's right there.

Oh, no, no he ain't.

He's a thousand miles away.

Huh?


Isn't it romantic?

When roosters fall in
love, they lose all reason.

Aaah, enough mush, let's go eat.

Eat?

How can you think of
food at a time like this?

Lasagna!

Mm-mm-mm-mm.

Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

Oh Goldie, when I left the farm,

I had such a big hole in my heart.

You coulda put a John Deere
tractor through there.

Oh, you poor thing.

My heart is so full I could,

I could just explode like a bloated lamb.

Oh King, you say the nicest things.

[Edmond] Chanticleer!

â™« This song is our treasure

â™« that we'll share our whole life through

Chanticleer!

I'm Sorry, Little Buddy,
but We're just no match

for that painted feather duster.

Oh yeah?

Uh, hey, where you goin'?

Well if I can't talk
to him, I'll talk to her.

â™« As I kiss and coo

â™« Kiss, kiss and coo with you

[Newsboy] Read all about it,
mysterious rains spreading!

Sun don't shine for farmers!

"Goldie Pheasant to co-star
in King's new picture."

You know, I think I'm too
little to get over those gates.

Well, I'm not.

[Patou] Hey, I think that's
her trailer over there.


(clears throat)

Excuse me, ma'am?


Oh, who are you?

Ma'am, I, I--


Oh my goodness.

(sneezing continues)

Oh, you poor thing!

There, now what are you
doing in my dressing room?

Please ma'am, you're the
only one who can help us.

We have to talk to Chanticleer.

I mean, the King.

There's a terrible flood, and

if he doesn't come home and crow...

Wait a minute, wait a minute!

You're the bad little
kitty Pinky told me about.

Bad, me?

I'm not bad.

You go away or I'll scream!


Please, if you'd just listen--


What happened?

Ah, she's a woman.

W-what?

That's the last straw, I've had it!

I wasn't talking to you--

Aah!

(Pinky laughing)

Well, well, well.

The dog, the cat, the bird and the mouse.

We meet at last, eh?


Let us go!

Max, take 'em to my
trailer, lock 'em up.

Make sure the King doesn't
get a whiff of this.

Oh no, what have I done?


No dogs, cats, boids or meeses.

Ahah!

[Patou] Now I gotta admit,
as bad guys go, the Duke's

nephew Hunch was more a
hoot than he was horrible.

(gurgling) Oh, boy.

[Patou] But still, he was a nuisance

and as we were tied up at the moment,

we weren't all that happy to see him.

Ahah!

â™« I will always think of you

â™« Ma, I miss your apple pie

â™« Ma, I miss your stew

â™« But most of all Ma, I miss you

Look at that, ooh, anticipation!

Ow!

Ah, oh!


â™« Let's get away, you and me together

â™« Two birds of a feather flying--

[Pinky] Cut, cut, cut!

Murray, what's with the snow here?

Take five, everybody.

And Miss Pheasant, how 'bout a smile, hmm?

Oh, it's supposed to be
summer, for cryin' out loud!

King, may I talk to you?

Ah honey, don't pay no mind.

You're gonna do just fine.

Yeah, but--

Now, now, no buts about it, honey.

King, I've done something awful.

What is it, baby?

Patou, Snipes, Peepers.

Goldie, where'd you get this?

From you, that night we first met.

They were here?

They're still here.

Why didn't you tell me?

'Cause she wasn't supposed to!


Goldie, I'm disappointed in ya.

I said to entertain
him, not to educate him.

Entertain me?

What's this all about?

Calm down, kid, your
friends are just fine.

No they're not, King.

He's got them tied up in his--

Shut up!

What?

Where are they?

What have you done with 'em?

Don't hurt him boys,
he's got a movie to make.

I ain't making nothin' with you.

Oh but King, I got a lotta
money tied up in this picture.

I don't wanna lose my money,

and you don't wanna lose your friends.

That's blackmail!

That's showbiz!

Make-up!

Here, kitty, kitty.

Ohhoho, acceleration!

Ow!

(TV playing)

Aah!

Stand by

Stand by!

Quiet on the set.

Quiet on the set!

Hey, shut up.

King, I'm sorry.

Don't talk to me, I'm thinkin'.

Roll sound.

Speed.

Where are they?

They're in Pinky's trailer outside.

Mark it.

42A, take two.


Oh yeah!

Hang on, honey.

(engine revving)

That's not in the script.

Stop those birds!

Get them back!

Look, there it is!

Hoohoho, annihilation, abominations.

Hold still, ow.


Watch out, King!

Whoa!

Oh no, no, I've killed him.

Chanticleer!

Hi, fellas.

He's dead, he's dead,
he's dead, he's dead!

Hey fellas, I'm sorry about this.

Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

He's not dead, untie me!

(engines roaring)

Oh no!

Let's get him out of here.

Who's there?

Oh no, not Pinky's Caddy.

Can you drive a car?

Piece of cake.

Edmond, you steer.

Steer?

I can't, I've n ever driven a car,

Edmond, do it.

We'll crash.

Don't be such a fraidy-cat!

Hey!

Whoa!

Edmond, open your eyes!

Uh-oh, look!

Abomination!

Oww!

Come on, Edmond, we
gotta lose that trailer.

How?

Edmond, cats are climbers.

I'm a boy!

Just climb down there--

What? I can't.

Don't be such a sissy!

I'll fall!

You're a cat, you won't fall!

I will!

Oh, I'll do it myself.

You're such a scaredy-cat.


Edmond!

Patou, help!

Hold on!


Help!

Peepers!

Don't be a fraidy-cat.

Fraidy-cat...

I'm not afraid of anything.

(voices overlapping)

No!

Stop!

Guys, we're gonna go back and get her!

(tires screech)

(horn honking)

Oh sure, they wanna play chicken, eh?

Don't worry, boss, I ain't turnin'.

Idiot, that's my car!

Whoa!

Snipes, the brake!

I think she landed up here.

Peepers!

Come on, we gotta find her!

Ooh, my baby!

My beautiful baby.

What are you lookin' at?

Get up there!

Peepers!

Oh King, wake up.

Oh, my shoes!


Bozo!

Snipes!

We're trapped, we're
trapped, we're trapped.

Don't look down!

(metal creaking)

This is it, fellas, we're goin' down.

Snipes, do something!

Don't let go!


What a catch!

Bring 'em in, Murray.

Murray?

Murray, who's Murray?

Peepers!

Edmond!

Let's have some help up
here, this is the Quirky X62

and these things are craaazy!

The King, he's gone and I'm ruined!

Oh no no no!

Oh, yes, yes, yes.

Gentlemen, go down and
invite our friends to dinner.

Hoo, hoo, hoo!

â™« We are the creatures of the night

â™« And we invite you all for dinner

â™« There's plenty of food to go around

â™« When the food is you

Who, me?

â™« Yes, you

â™« We thought a picnic would be nice

â™« And we're so pleased
that you could join us

â™« We're glad you're home, trick or treat

â™« Fa la la la la la

â™« How sweet

â™« Now's the time, say your prayers

â™« Time's up

â™« Fa la la la la la, how sweet

â™« Fa la la la la, let's eat

Please, pass the pork.


Excellent, gentlemen, excellent.


Alright you owls, this is Edmond.

It's over for you, we've got Chanticleer!


Where's my mom and dad?

I can't see them.

Don't worry, we'll find them.

(rotors whirring)


Ooh...

How is he, Goldie?


I think he's waking up.

Good, let's go in for a landing.

Hold on!

Ta-da, annihilation!

Oh!

(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

Aah!

[Peepers] She's going down!

Abandon ship, abandon ship!


Is it time for the show?

King, you're heavy.

Show me that stage, and gimme that mic.

Oooh, where am I?

Chanti, you're home.

Huh?

Ooh, I feel like I've been
hit by a 800-pound mule.

What's happening?

There's no time to explain.

Chanticleer, you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

The owls could be here any second.

Who are you?

He's a friend, now please, crow!

Oh, I can't, I don't know if I ever did.

Of course you did!

Chanti, we were wrong.

It's your job to bring up the sun.

It hasn't shined since you left.

Ah, but look.


Cock-a-doo...

Doo...

Uh-oh.

Aw, guys, it's no use.

All I do now is sing the blues.

Hmph, "the King."

We don't want the King,
we want Chanticleer!


The Duke!



I know it's frightfully
impolite to eavesdrop like this,

but are you by any chance
having trouble with your throat?

Nothing to say?

Cock-a-doodle-doo?

Stop it!

Chanti, crow!

Shut up, you!

Come on, you guys!

Show him we believe.

I told you to be quiet!

Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer,

Chanticleer, Chanticleer!


Duke, leave him alone,
it's me you want, not him.


Chanticleer...

Chanticleer.

Very stupid, Patou.

Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer.

Look here, quiet!

[All] Chanticleer,
Chanticleer, Chanticleer.

(all chanting)

Fools, all of you.

Silence!

I'll give you Chanticleer!

[All] Chanticleer,
Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

(maniacal laughter)

Look, it's comin' up without him

You're a phony.

Are you by any chance having

a little trouble with your throat?

You're a phony.

It's coming up without him.

It's your job to bring up the sun.

It hasn't shined since you left.


Chanticleer, you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

Cock-a-dooooo,

Cock-a-dooooo,

Cock-a-dooooo.



Hehehehe!

Hunch, it's me, Uncle Dukey.

Uncle Dukey?

Come here.

Hunch, no!


Animation, it's music to my ears.

Hold still, you little twerp!

Aggravation, abomination, alienation.


[Patou] Well, our journey
had finally come to an end.

Old Chanticleer was back
to stay, the sun was up,

the rain had stopped, and
the owls were gone for good.

Everything seemed to be
turning out just fine,

except for one thing, Edmond.

We just didn't know how to help him.


He was a little boy.

Oh, he was a handsome little boy.

Edmond, Edmond...

Edmond, Edmond.

Edmond...

Edmond, Edmond, come on honey, wake up.


Wake up, honey.

Mom, Mom!

Look, I'm not furry anymore!

I'm a boy!

Lie down, sweetheart.

Mom, is that the sun?

Mm-hmm.

Edmond, Edmond, get back into bed.

Wow.

Okay, take a look.

Look, Mom, Chanticleer raised the sun.

Hi Edmond, how you doing, son?

Fine, but what happened
to Chanti and the gang?

Mom, where are they?

Edmond, Chanticleer is just a storybook.

Those characters are only make-believe.

Now come on, let's get back to bed.

No mom, no they're not, I saw them.

I bet they're wondering
what happened to me.

I wanna tell them I'm okay.

I'm sure they know.

Ypu think so?

They'll be just fine.

[Patou] Edmond's mom
was right, of course,

but she didn't know why.

She also never knew just what
stopped the rain that night,

but that just goes to show you,

with a little help from your friends,

you can do just about anything.

Welcome home, Chanticleer.

Thanks for bringing back the sun.

â™« Cock-a-doooo-doodle-doodle-dooo-dooo

[Edmond] Chanticleer!

Hey, Edmond!

Whoowee!

â™« Cock-a-doo, what a day
