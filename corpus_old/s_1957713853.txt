(dramatic music)

(fingers cracking)

(dramatic music)

(people chattering)
(gentle music)

(traffic humming)
(gentle music)

(people chattering)
(gentle music)

Sorry.

(traffic humming)
(gentle music)

Excuse me.

Sorry to bother you.

Yes?
I'm lost.

It's my first time in New York,
actually.

I never rode a subway before.

I got a little too excited

when they announced Times
Square.

So, I jumped off,
but left my bag behind.

Had my phone, wallet,
everything in it.

Wasn't even my stop.

I don't have any money, sorry.

Oh, God, no, I don't need money.

Actually, my ATM card, it's at
the hotel, with my computer,

so I can do the whole "Find
my Phone" when I get back.

You know, the Cloud?

What do you need?

Right.

Can you help me?

First time in New York, huh?

Yeah.

More like, first time out of
the house.

You need the East Side.

Can I get there walking?

Or light jogging.

I don't know your rhythm.

mall walking, where I'm from.

my town.

Where you from, 1985?

(he chuckles)

You're funny.

You do that dry wit thing.

Very New York.

Go four blocks east
and you'll hit it, okay?

And which way is east?

Kidding.

I do dry wit, too. (chuckles)

I'm not a complete idiot.

I needed your help.

You gave that to me, and
for that I thank you,

but I never would've asked
if you weren't so beautiful.

I mean, is that okay to say?

I don't mean it, like,
offensively.

I'm not objectifying you, I'm
just saying

it was a pleasure to
receive your directions.

Thought you should know.

Heading east now.

(gentle music)

Hey, mall walker?

Uh.

Joshua.

You'll get lost.

I'll show you.

Really?

Oh, thanks.

What's your name?

(gentle music)

Haven't decided yet.

Dry wit. (chuckles)

(dramatic music)

I, I, I, I, I think that's east.

(people chattering)
(traffic humming)

I'm Veronica.

I live upstairs.

Wanna come up?


Don't make me regret it.

(soft dramatic music)
(people chattering)

(ominous music)

(dramatic music)

Want a drink?

Sure.

You have any pop?

Soda.

Where I'm from we call it pop.

Or is that illegal here?

Didn't New York pass a ban?

Or was that just Biggie size?

I have alcohol.

Would you like alcohol or
should I get you a juice box?

Alcohol is fine.

I drink.

(gentle music)

So you live in a hotel?

My family owned the unit
when it was residential.

They can never kick me out.

Perks of being a true New
Yorker.

It's a really cool place.

Like, vintage, huh?

(dramatic music)

I mean, it's not dirty or
anything, just looks old.

Lived in. (chuckles)

(dramatic music)

Your place has character.

Sit down.

You like whiskey?

I like everything,

except watermelon and cucumber.

But that's not what's happening
right now.

What's happening right now is
whiskey.

With you.

Veronica.

Cheers.

(glasses clink)

Cheers.

(she gulps)

(she sighs)

Get up.

We're gonna do it on the table?


I said,

"Get up."

Walk.

(dramatic music)

Move!

Up!

(dramatic music)

We can't have sex if you don't
want to.

I do, it's just so much right
now.


(dramatic music)

(she chuckles)

It helps if you really get in
there.

(dramatic music)

(she laughs)

Are you a virgin?

You're pathetic.

Ah, the shirt stays on.

Get on the bed.

(dramatic music)

(ominous music)

(he groans)

(ominous music)

(he gasps)

(eerie music)


Hello?

Hey.

Hello?

Junk mail?

I swear, I get about 20
pounds of this shit a year.

And I get a ticket if I don't
recycle, but this is okay.

I need to get going.

A flyer for an antique
mall in Rhinebeck. (chuckles)

Where the fuck is Rhinebeck?

Like I said, I need to get
going.

Remind me?
800.


No wallet?

train with my cell and my bag.

But your ATM card is at the
hotel

and your computer can "Find
Your Phone."

You remembered.

It's part of the job.

Well, that's nice.

Thanks.

Well, it was a pleasure to meet
you

and do that.

Okay.

You know, it only
happens, like, once a year,

for my birthday, which
is today. (chuckles)

It's good to treat yourself.

So, I guess that makes you my
present.

I'm not a present.

I'm a person.

Oh, yeah, of course, I
didn't mean it like that.

(dramatic music)

Now, I'm very sorry.

(dramatic music)

I thought it was you.

Oh, my God.

I don't feel so good.

(dramatic music)

(ghostly voice mumbles)

(he retches)

(ghostly voice mumbles)

(woman groans)

(woman screams)

(he coughs)

I'll call 911.

It'll pass.

You need a doctor.
I don't.

Go!

Your eyes are fucking bleeding!

All right.

(ghostly voice mumbles)

Finally.

(ghostly voice mumbles)


(ominous music)

(ominous music)

You stayed.

How are you feeling?

Like I'm levitating.

Are these tarps?

It's all I could find.

You an outdoorsy dude?

No, I had the walls done.

The painter left them behind.

Lucky me.

Oh, I hope you don't
mind, I made some tea.

I think this it's mint.

It's the only scent I
recognized.

Want a cup?

Not now.

I take some of that water,
though.

(ice cubes clinking)


(ominous music)

For my homies.

(ominous music)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't you just choke me out,

punch me...


Judge my boner...

Or lack thereof.

This the same girl?

(she chuckles)

You know, I appreciate it, I
really do.

You shouldn't have stayed.

It's not every day you see
blood gushing

from a man's eyes.

I wanna see how this ends.

You will.

(ominous music)

(he groans)

I have some aspirin in my purse.

Uh...

Another whiskey'd be better.

When you can get up on
your own, I'll pour you some.



Uh, it's mostly historical
books, biographies.

(he sighs)

And "Anne of Green Gables"?

What can I say?

I love a red-headed orphan.

(she chuckles)

There's an Annie poster
around here, somewhere.

Or not.

The mind's a little fuzzy right
now.

Eyes of blood and such.

(ominous music)

Yeah.

What was that about?
(ominous music)

An allergic reaction, to the
saffron.

Huh?

The stuff you put in my drink.

I didn't tell you what it was?

No.

Your message said find the
vial behind the whiskey

and pour it in your drink.

What did you think it was?

Not saffron.

It's an organic aphrodisiac.

Oh, well, if it's organic.

I won't take Viagra.

It's like admitting you're
officially old.

How old are you?

400.

(dramatic music)

What?

40.

Feels like 400. (chuckles)

Oh, that's right.

Erm, happy birthday.
Oh.

Please, don't, it's too
depressing.

Can I have that whiskey now?

Can you get up?

No. (chuckles)

Next question.

(gentle music)

Oh.

(she sighs)

I don't know.

Well, here's your chance
to ask a John anything.

Client.

"John" feels too anonymous.

We wanna be anonymous.

You can trust me.

I'm the keeper of many secrets.

(ominous music)

Wow, you sound like a sexy
wizard.

Comic book culture has opened
up an entirely new market

to me.

up all their IT bucks

to fuck a lady warrior?

Or damsel.

Depends on the guy.

Mainly, they wanna show
me their collections

and play with my tits.

They're sweet.

They ask if I'm okay.

Do we need a safe word?

Do I want a drink?

Oh, like this?

Did we have a safe word?

It's whiskey.

Please, geeks and dragons?

I have earned it.

Okay.

But I'm cutting it with water.

All right.

You're the boss.


(dramatic music)

(speaking foreign language)

(dramatic music)

(speaking foreign language)

(dramatic music)

(speaking foreign language)

(speaking foreign language)

(dramatic music)

(ominous music)

it like an asshole.

Cheers.
Never cheer twice

in the same day.

It disrespects the gods.

You're fucking with me.

Numerology?

Oh, God.

Numbers play a huge part in
our lives.

Who are you, a mere
mortal, to praise yourself?

You're not a creator.

You're a creation.

Know your place.

(she laughs)

I'm totally fucking with you,
man.

(glass clink)

Are you an "aliens are real" and

"we have twins in an alternate
universe" kind of gal?

Aliens are real.

I've seen the footage.


But, no, to twinsies.

I do think we have multiple
souls in our bodies, though.

Cool.

Thanks for the sip.

Bye.


Not me per se, it's just...

I don't know.

You believe in reincarnation?

Yes.

It's like that.

We're born with different parts
of souls

that make up our personalities.

That's where instinct, deja vÃ¹,

things like that come from.

So, if I have a mood swing,

it's a dormant soul wanting
his "me" time? (chuckles)

Or if I think I've met you
before, I actually have,

400 years ago, at a
primitive family reunion?

Never mind.

You don't get it.

(dramatic music)
Oh, I get it.

But I believe, no matter how
many souls we might have,

we are born with a singular
vision.

And when we find out what that
is,

nothing and no one can stop us.

Wanna hear mine?

Sure.

To finish this drink!

(he laughs)

You're fuckin' weird, dude.

Coming from the chick with
extra souls in her, great.

(dramatic music)

What's with the red tubs in
your fridge?

Blood.

Duh.

It's beet juice.

Well, beet juice and kale
and some other bullshit.

Vitamin crap.

You on a juice cleanse?

Nah.

I hate food.

Like, the actual selecting
and chewing and cooking of it.

If I could take a pill, I would,

but I can't, so I drink my
meals.

So, you're saying you don't eat?

Not if I can help it.

The only solid food I like is
popcorn.

Yeah, that was in there, too.

Yeah.

When it's cold it lasts longer.

Plus, I don't even have
the dishes to make a meal.

(he chuckles)

Maybe that's why your eyes bled.

You need to fucking eat.

I know what my body
needs, thank you very much.

Solid food is not one of them.

What?

I need to ask you something.

(she sighs)

We're having a good time, right?

Sure.

Let that be enough.

Okay.

Nah, I'm still asking.

And, here, I thought you were
different.

You don't know what I'm gonna
say.

Sure, I do.

The same thing they all
ask: "Why do you do this?

"Why are you a sex worker?

"Let me help you."

I hear this bullshit all the
time.

Dudes are concerned.
No, they're not.

They had the best sex in their
lives

and they don't wanna keep
paying for it.

Mm, good point.

So they think they're
thoughtful with their kind words

and somehow they're gonna
make me their girlfriend.

Or maybe not their girlfriend

but certainly a woman that
waits by the phone longing

for their compassionate cock.

(he chuckles)

Because that's what every woman
wants,

to be valued by a man.

I do it for the money.

I like nice things. (sighs)

Why you like getting choked?

(dramatic music)

I like to disconnect.

It feels better when I cum.

You think love is overrated?

Love?

No.

Sex?

Yes.

Really?
Sure.

It's an activity, nothing more.

Uh, like, mall walking?

No, (chuckles) like crocheting.

Huh?
Think about it.

You do all this work with
the knots and the hooks,

building up your stitches,
and the closer you get,

the more excited you become.

And you work harder and faster,

and when you finish,
you have this priceless,

one of a kind experience you
created.

And then you move on to your
next bag.

That's all sex is.

It's not love.

It's a hobby.

So, making love, you
don't like that, either?

Mm.

Ugh, I hate that phrase.

It creeps me out.

"Celestial" does it for me.

Ugh, what a wet word.

"Celestial."

Ugh, gross!

(she laughs)

You're an idiot.

Making love is a beautiful
thing.

It turns an orgasm into an
obligation.

Save the love for the important
stuff.

Hey, now, sex is important.

So is exercise.

And voting.

And eating solid foods.

But to truly love someone?

That's not sex.

(dramatic music)

The only person I ever
loved was my grandma.

And you?

It's obvious the true love
of your life is your mother.

Most men, it's the same thing.

I take away their power,
make them feel inadequate

and punish them for being bad
boys.

Because their first crush was
mommy

and they hate themselves for it.

We fall in love with
the people who raise us.

And we should.

But don't let that cloud your
desires

because you were taught sex
equals love.

It doesn't.

Maybe that's the case
with your dragon dudes,

but I don't wanna fuck my
mother.

(dramatic music)
I want to save her.

(knocking on door)

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
offend you.

Yeah, well, it's been an
unexpected day.

(knocking on door)

Wait!

(dramatic music)

I should go.

(dramatic music)


(dramatic music)

You're too early!

I wrote it down in the book.

Two o'clock.

(ominous music)
(ghostly voices mumbling)

(Veronica screams)

I told you I'd be right back!


(dramatic music)

(creature growling)

(woman screaming in the
distance)

(she snorts)

(he chuckles)

I'm that boring?

What's going on?

You tell me.

You fell asleep.

(dramatic music)

I mean, I get it.

Dudes talk about mom, chicks
check out.

But full on dream time?

Ouch!

(ghostly voice mumbling)

Someone else was here.

Yeah, my aunt.

She thought I was at work.

She let herself in.

She went on vacation and
borrowed my suitcase.

But I heard yelling.

I'm sure you did.

I used this suitcase once.

It's got fucking bag lady wear
and tear.

There was yelling, for sure.

(dramatic music)

No.

Someone else was here in this
room.

Just us.

I don't even have a roommate.

Was it the numerology gods?

Ooh.

(dramatic music)

(ghostly voice mumbles)

You hear that?

(woman screams)

(ghostly voice mumbles)

It's me.

Well, not me, my favorite show.

Favorite's pushing it,
but I love true crime.

I'm watching "Second Marriage
Murders."

What?

I didn't wanna wake you.

Guess I gave you nightmares
instead.

(ghostly voices mumbling)

Sorry.

I also like "Housewife
Horrors," "Killer Nurses,"

most reenactment shows.

Usually, the man is up to no
good

and the woman's out for revenge.

I'm stuck in a black
widow spiral right now.

I'm watching one where
this guy gets slaughtered

by three sisters over his
lottery ticket. (chuckles)

Yikes!

Wanna see?

No.

It's best I probably go.

One more drink?

For scaring you?

Please?

A quick one.

Only kind I like.

(ghostly voices mumbling)

These sisters are crazy.


(ominous music)

I'll take five bucks for it.

Oh, fuck!

You scared me.

that.

(glasses clink)

I'll stick with the tea.

Hmm, more for me.

Uh, you want the chair?

Oh, no.

I prefer this.

What's so hot about down there?

It's more authentic.

Makes me feel like I'm part of
the space.

Join me.

On the floor?

Yeah, may sound hippydippy,
but connecting with the base

of your home is a refreshing
perspective.

When we became land animals,

we used the ground for
everything we needed.

We didn't start out on chairs
and beds.

And then shoes were invented.

I blame shoes for the
downfall of humanity.

You know, if our feet can't
sense danger,

how do we know when it's coming?

You lost me at hippydippy.

Oh, there's that New
York wit. (chuckles)

(dramatic music)

Lots of exciting things
coming off this floor.

I know.

Thoughts,

vibrations,

popcorn.

Oh.

(she chuckles)

So, I understood about

none of what you just said.

It happens.

But the bare feet thing, I
get it.

Aaow!

(she chuckles)

When I was a kid, my
grandma had a birthday

at a roller rink.

We lived for an all-skate.

Your grandma skated with you?

Of course.

She was legendary.

Well, I was pretty good, too,
with the tricks and turns.

I mean, we were at the rink all
the time.

She taught me everything.

But I wanted to do something
special:

an original skate, just for her.

Aw.

But I didn't own any skates.

I rented from the rink, so
the practice I had to do

with them bare feet.

This is where I support your
theory.

Am I ready for this?

This motion will work easy on
a wheel.

Throw in some arms and a
shoulder.

(gentle music)

How about a sleeping prayer?

(she chuckles)

(gentle music)

I was looking tight.

And when the party came, skates
went on.

It looked more like this.

Mm, ah, ah, huh.
(he laughs)

The skates fucked up my show!

Grandma didn't care.

She said it was the best
rolling she'd ever seen.

(he laughs)

I miss her.


(gentle music)

Do you have the strength to
fake-skate?


How's your balance?

Oh, I can do tree pose.

Sort of.
(both chuckle)

I'll only teach you the chorus.

The verses are too experimental.

Ready?

Yes.

Ah, it was to Grandma's
favorite song, "It Had To Be You."

â™ª It had to be you â™ª

â™ª It had to be you â™ª

â™ª I wandered around â™ª

â™ª And finally found â™ª

â™ª The somebody who â™ª

â™ª Could make me be true â™ª

â™ª Could make me feel blue â™ª

(she chuckles)

â™ª And even be glad â™ª

â™ª Just to be sad â™ª

â™ª Thinkin' of you â™ª

â™ª Some others I've seen â™ª

â™ª Might never be mean â™ª

â™ª Might never be cross â™ª

â™ª Or try to be boss â™ª

â™ª But they wouldn't do â™ª

â™ª For nobody else gave me a
thrill â™ª

â™ª With all your faults â™ª

â™ª I love you still â™ª

â™ª It had to be you â™ª

â™ª It had to be you â™ª

(she chuckles)

(she coughs)

(she gasps)

That wasn't tea.

(she gasps)

(dramatic music)

(ghostly voice growls)

Stay calm.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

What's happening?

I don't wanna say.

Help me.

This isn't your house!

Who makes tea without asking?

I knew when you said mint,
you used my Carolina jasmine,

which is an herb, not
a tea, that causes...

Well, you know, this!

I can't let you go now.

You're a liar.

And a tattletale.

People can't know about me.


You ratted out the dorks who
pay you

to treat them like dragon
slayers.

You tell some John about me...

Sorry, client, eh, eh, eh...

Before you know it, I'm
all over social media.

Doesn't work like that.

Well, you'd know, you fucking
gossip!

(dramatic music)

When you can move on
your own, he'll start.

I won't let him hurt you like
this.

(dramatic music)

I'm giving you to my dad.

(dramatic music)

(ominous music)

(Joshua snores)

(dramatic music)


That was a great idea.

I get to help you now.

I hate owing people.

That's been my whole life.

(dramatic music)

(ominous music)

(Veronica pants)
(dramatic music)

Take a little.

For the nerves.

Helps mine.

Oh, oh.

Waste not want not.

For when you feel better.

(dramatic music)

You were gonna drug me again.

(dramatic music)

Saw where I kept my money and
rob me.

After this great conversations?

The things I shared with you?

I have feelings, too, you know.

So do I.

We're not talking about you!

We're talking about me!

I paid you for a wish.

You drug me.

You choke me.

You leave.

kill me.

You don't stay.

You leave.

Why did you stay?

Sorry.

This is your fault!

(he grunts)

Let me go.


Oh, I want to, but I can't.

Yes, you can.

It's him, Veronica.

It isn't me.

(ominous music)

I don't want to tell her.

I don't want her to know.

Don't make me say it!

(ominous music)

I'm an abomination.

My mother lived a long time ago.

To the people in her
village, she was a mystic,

a seer,

a healer.

(dramatic music)


No man would have her.

(dramatic music)

The kind of power she held,

it welcomed darkness into her
life.

(dramatic music)

What's more dangerous than
thinking you're a god?

Shoes.

Yes!

Fuck shoes!

Get right with the earth!

(dramatic music)

different circumstances.

We could've been great friends.

We still can.

Are you even listening?

Your lies don't work on me.

When I tell you I have seen it
all,

I have fucking seen it all.

(dramatic music)

I can't die.

(dramatic music)

May I continue, please?

All my mother wanted was a
child.

So she called him Madua
Muz, an evil water spirit.

But tomato, tomatoe.

(dramatic music)

Okay, okay!

No more jokes!

I'll finish the story.

He gave my mother me.

And, in exchange, she promised
to give him a sacrifice

for every year he allowed me to
live.

I was born from the water where
she led men to their deaths.

My blood is their fury,
my bones their fear.

I am their eternal damnation.

But to Mom I was just a baby,

(dramatic music)

Her baby,

to love (sniffles)

Forever.

(dramatic music)

Saffron cleanses the soul from
impurities.

All newborns were bathed
in it, like a christening.

But not what I am.

Saffron can't fix that. (sobs)

My skin turned yellow.

My eyes bled.

I was dying.

Until Daddy appeared. (sobs)

He touched my face and
I came back to life.

My existence was her weakness.

No one could know about me.

So she hid me away.

(dramatic music)

I had nothing!

(dramatic music)

No friends!

No skills!

No chance at a real life!

(dramatic music)

I was her secret for 40
years, and I hated her for it.

(dramatic music)

Daddy appeared to me again.

He gave me a choice,

the first choice of my life:

kill myself and break Mom's
heart,

or take her life

(dramatic music)
(banging on door)

And become immortal.

(banging on door)

I wanna go outside!

I wanna feel the sun!

I wanna live!

So I killed her!

I put my hands around her
throat and I choked her!

I did it!

You're insane.

I'm not, he is!

Every year, on my birthday,
he says he'll bring her back.

Well, not her, like, a
reincarnated doesn't know

she's my Mom version, her
soul in somebody else.

If I find her, I get to do the
deal again.

My life for hers.

If I'm wrong, he gets
his yearly sacrifice.

Mom should live, not me.

I can't hurt anyone anymore.

I thought you were her!

Why?

Your message.

It said you make miracles
out of worthless men.

That's the last thing she said
to me before I killed her.

(dramatic music)

When we do this again, you run.

The saffron will work.

Let me die.

You're her, I know it.

(she grunts)

(he screams)

(she groans)

(dramatic music)

(she pants)
(dramatic music)

(he screams)
(dramatic music)

(dramatic music)

Shit.

(dramatic music)

Help.

(dramatic music)

It's a lot to take in, I know.


(dramatic music)

(dramatic music)

Help.

Help.
Whoa!

What's going on?

Get the fuck away from me!

Where are my clothes?

In here, in the living room.

Cover with this.


I don't know what you think
happened,

but you tripped and hit your
head.

Then I carried you in here.

You've been out for a few hours.

You'll sure get the money,
that's not a problem.

You know what, take, take, take
a grand.

I don't want you leaving here
thinking I'm some sick fuck.

I was trying to help you.

I'm sorry I scared you.

I fell?

Tripped.

Over me.

I didn't expect you to
shove me up the stairs,

which was the type of abuse I
wanted,

but my core is total shit
and I landed on my face.

Then you landed on my
back and hit your head.

I used to be into
ambulance chaser fantasies,

you know, I'd hire a girl to
fake-choke,

give her CPR, she'd reward me
with sex.

So I thought maybe I
requested the wrong thing,

but you wouldn't wake up.

I didn't call 911
because I don't want them

to know why you're here.

I've never been arrested.

I don't know your history with
the cops.

I say no to jail time.

No!

(dramatic music)
(she pants)

I can't take your money.

Oh, no, that's yours.

You're taking it.

No.
Yes.

I insist.

(dramatic music)

All right then.

She's taking the money.

(both laugh)

On one condition.

Whatever you want.

(dramatic music)

Give me a do-over.

A do-over?

Like, sex for real?

Or is this dry wit?

Yes,

sex for real.

When?

I'm out of town the rest of the
week, but maybe next Monday?

How about now?

Well, sure, but...

Can we, like, start from the
beginning?

You know, like, I'll meet
you at the restaurant,

and I'm lost and stuff?

Sure.

(dramatic music)

Meet you in 15 minutes.

Okay?

(dramatic music)

Oh, wait.

Your key.

(dramatic music)

(ominous music)

(ominous music)

(dramatic music)

A drink?

What do you like?

Well, I'd take another latte.

That really hit the spot.


You want alcohol?

(dramatic music)

Oh, when in Rome.

(dramatic music)


Oh, yeah.

Sure.

You like whiskey?

I like everything, except
liars and tattletales.

(dramatic music)

Oh, but that's not what's
happening right now.

What's happening right now is
whiskey.

With you.

Veronica.

Cheers.

(glasses clink)

Cheers.

Get up.

Getting my do-over.



I'm up.


Walk.

Move!

(dramatic music)

Get up, you pussy.

(dramatic music)

What the fuck even is that?

Are you even a man?

I am.

(dramatic music)

The shirt stays on.


(dramatic music)

Get on the bed.

(dramatic music)

(dramatic music)

(gentle music)

Good God.

Wow.


Want another drink?

I have another
appointment in a few hours.

Sure, I understand.

Maybe a quick drink?

Only kind I like.

Allow me.

Moving in, I see.


Acts like she owns me.

Nice.

That's what you paid for.

(gentle music)

Should we cheers?

And disrespect the numerology
gods?

Are you crazy?

What?

That

shit you talked about earlier,

something about you can't
cheers twice in one day

'cause you'll look like an
asshole in front of the gods.

I thought I dreamed that.

(dramatic music)

Well, you did, you told me
about it,

the dream that you had when you
fell.

No.

(dramatic music)

You remember where I
keep the good whiskey

but you can't remember
your dream? (chuckles)

I remember my dream.

I don't remember telling you
about it.

Well, you did.

(dramatic music)

So, should we cheer?

Or give the gods their respect?

(dramatic music)

Cheers.

(glasses clink)

(dramatic music)

Thanks.

Hold on, Veronica.

I mean, you don't have to tell
me.

I, I, I, I respect your privacy,
and everything about you,

really, but is Veronica your
real name?

No.

(he chuckles)

Well, can you tell me what it
is?

You know, for (chuckles) my
memory bank.

(dramatic music)

Genevieve.

Wow!

That is way better than
Veronica.

Not when everybody
calls you Jenny or Gene.


You okay?

Genevieve.

Run!

(dramatic music)

(he retches)


(dramatic music)

You should've believed me.

(dramatic music)

(she whimpers)
(dramatic music)

(dramatic music)

A little bit longer?

This one was different.

(dramatic music)

(he sighs)

(dramatic music)

(he gasps)
(ominous music)

(bones cracking)

(she gasps)

(speaking foreign language)

(dramatic music)

(he groans)

Mummy.

(dramatic music)

(dramatic music)

(eerie music)

(upbeat music)
