I can't wait till we're older.

We can leave this place.

â™ªâ™ª

Where do you want to go?

â™ªâ™ª

Just somewhere different.

Somewhere where
the sun's always shining.

Like today.

â™ªâ™ª

California.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Let's go.

â™ªâ™ª

Really?

â™ªâ™ª

Promise you won't

Do you understand?
We'll be all right here.

We'll be all right here
if someone comes to rest,

but we'll have to
work together.

You'll have to help.

Now, I want you to go in

[Cup clatters]

What are you gonna

What are you gonna

Hmm?

I need you to listen to me.

It's me, Bobby.

Kevin, please answer me!

Can you hear me?

Kevin.


Kevin?

Kevin, are you okay?

Did he hurt you?

No, I'm fine.

Where is he?

H-He's gone.

What about the other one?

I-I don't know.

Can you come to the door?

No, he put something around
my ankle, and I can't move.

I'm scared, Bobby.

Me, too, okay?

But I'm not gonna leave you.

It's it's friends
till the end, remember?

Friends to the end.

Don't worry,
I'm gonna find keys.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Car horn honks]

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, I'm gonna drive
and get help.

What do you mean?
I can't find the keys.

I-I'll be right back.

Bobby!
Just trust me!

[Insects chirping]

[Engine turns over]

â™ªâ™ª

[Static crackling]

A-And that's the thing...

these aren't law-abiding
Americans.

These aren't good people.

These are rapists.
These are criminals.

Now, I'll tell you something...
they're coming for you.

They're coming for your jobs.

They're coming for your women.

Whoa. Whoa!

They take and take
till they...

No-no-no-no-no.

[Engine revving]

â™ªâ™ª

Come on!
They want to take your guns.

â™ªâ™ª

Kevin, I need you.

Bobby, do you find help?

I found a phone.

It's like the ones
you see in movies.

It's big, heavy.

It has a curly cord thing.

Oh, my grandma
has one of those.

I-I don't know how it works.

You need to plug it
into a wall.

It doesn't have a plug.

Well, t-t-there should be
some cord around,

and it ...it looks like
an Internet cable.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Watch beeping]

911, what's your emergency?

Yeah, w... M-Me and my friend
have been kidnapped.

What's your name, sir?

Bobby. Bobby Green.
Okay, Bobby.

Is the person that took you
still there?

Can they hear you?
N-No, they're gone.

but my friend's still stuck.

You have to hurry, please.

[Metal creaking]
[Straining]

â™ªâ™ª

We're tracking your location.

Can you tell me anything
about where you are?

It's a house.
Okay, a house.

Do you know where it is?

There's a lot
of grass and trees

and a big oil rig out front.


â™ªâ™ª


Oh!

Ooh!


Oh...

[Whimpering, wincing]

[Approaching tires rumbling]

Bobby, hide!

...see anything else...

â™ªâ™ª

No.

He... He's back.
He just came back.

[Car door slams]
You have to hurry, please.

We'll... We'll be there soon.
Just stay on the line.

We almost have your location.

Just stay with me
a little longer.

No, I have to go.

Is there a place you can hide?

N-No! No, he'll find me!

He'll see me!
He'll see the body, okay?

Bobby, talk to me.
I have to go.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Door closes]

[Footsteps approaching]

â™ªâ™ª

Do you really think...

I don't think anything.

I just know that
I'm going to my room.

And if anybody comes in,
I'll shoot him.

Or her.

[Whimpering, sniffling]

â™ªâ™ª

O-Ow!

[Chattering continues]

Certainly not.

And right as somebody else
in this house

who once has left his room.

Did you hear anything?

Organ music.

That and someone walking.

You look downstairs,
and I'll look out here.

Why not together?

There may be only minutes,
seconds left of someone's life!

Why waste time?

[Mysterious synth music plays]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

It's almost over, Nelly.

You really keep
the hours passing.

[Wood creaks]

What's happening?

We've done it.

A perfect crime.

Beautiful.

Please!

I just want to go home!

Please.

Up here at the window! Please!

Hello?! Please!

[Voice fading]
Please, I'm up here!

Help me, please!

â™ªâ™ª

[Voice fading in]
Help, please!

I'm up here! Help!

â™ªâ™ª

[Knocking on door]

There is a pattern
to all that lives!

An order, an arrangement!

She had a heart, and a brain,
and her spirit was in both!

Not in one or the other!

No.

[Knocking continues]

I'll give her a brain
and a heart.

Yes, and what of her soul?

You say you love her and...

You can remember
her love for you.

Then how can you make of her
an experiment of horror?

[Louder volume] All the skill and
science I possess was meant for this.

[Pounding on door]
Life has a pattern.

The whole pattern of my life
is shaping itself

to save her now.

Then, you intend to
go through with it?

Yes.

Good evening.

Are you the owner
of this residence?

[Suspenseful music blaring]
[Faintly] Yes, I am.

Can you cut that down?

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª

I'm sorry.

Are you the owner
of this residence?

Yes. Yes, I am.

Um...

m-may I ask what this is about?

We received a distress call
about a suspected kidnapping.

Dispatch traced it
to this general area.

Oh, my God. You're kidding.

In this area?

Have you seen anything
unusual tonight?

No, no.

It's just another
quiet night around here.

W... Except for the TV,
of course.

It's just nice to hear
something in the background.

Mm. Do you have
any kids, Miss...?

Burton. Uh, no.

No kids.

What about a Mr. Burton?

Are you making a pass
at me, Officer?

No, ma'am, I'm not.

It's just me.

â™ªâ™ª

Can I see some I.D.,
Miss Burton?

â™ªâ™ª

Of course.

It's, uh, just right inside.

I'll be back in a minute.

â™ªâ™ª

[Thrilling music
continues on TV]

â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Ms. Burton!

â™ªâ™ª

Miss Burton, can you
hurry this up, please?

â™ªâ™ª

Ms. Burton, I'm comin' in!

â™ªâ™ª

People fear what
they don't understand.

And what they can't see.

Ms. Burton!
No, what are you talking about?

You're nothing a freak of life.

And a freak of death!

[Door closes]
Why should I be afraid of a few locks on the door?

But last night, you ran.

â™ªâ™ª

[TV turns off]

[Insects chirping]

Hello?

Ms. Burton?

â™ªâ™ª

[Rapid approaching footsteps]

Help us!

Oh, my God.

Gah!

â™ªâ™ª

Open the door, kid.

â™ªâ™ª

Open... the goddamn... door.

â™ªâ™ª

Okay, listen to me.

I know you're scared,

but I'm coming in there
one way or another.

So, if you open the door,

I promise you,
I will not hurt you.

â™ªâ™ª

Do it!

Let me in.

Come on!

Open the door!

Open the goddamn door!

Open the door, bitch!

Fuck it!

You know, I never really planned
on taking you out of that trunk.

I figured you'd
suck all the air out

and that'd be the end of it.

But, here we are.

[Object clatters]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

My friends like
tough boys, though.

Not like your crybaby
buddy upstairs.

They actually pay good money
for the ones who put up a fight.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

They don't normally go for ones
who look like you,

but I think
they'll make an exception.

â™ªâ™ª

You know what?

Since you clearly like
your little fucking friend,

how about I swap you out
for your pal?

How does that sound?

Ugh! Augh!
[Gun clatters]


â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª


Ngh! [Grunts]

Get away from me!

Away from me!
Kevin! Kevin, it's me!

It's me... Bobby.

It's me.

Bobby.


You didn't leave me.

You didn't...

Did he...?
No.

Here, put this on.


She's still downstairs.

We need to get you
out of here, okay?

[Chains rattling]

You have to help me
pull, okay?

One, two, three.

[Both straining]

â™ªâ™ª


One more time.

[Both straining]

â™ªâ™ª

Be right back, okay?
I promise.

Okay.

â™ªâ™ª

[Thudding]
[Chain rattling]

â™ªâ™ª

What are you doing?

Just trust me, okay?

It'll be all right.

J-Just back up a little bit.

â™ªâ™ª

Three, two...


â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Both gasping, grunting]

Ow! [Groaning]

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, God!

[Electricity zapping]

[Gasping, coughing]

Kevin, what...
Kevin, what is it?!


Come on.


[Coughing, gagging]

[Both groaning, panting]

I have an idea.

[Groans]
N... No, no!

Don't leave me again!
Don't leave me!

Listen, listen!
Listen, okay?

Don't leave me again.

The worst thing that could have
happened to us already happened.

Just stay here.
I'll be right back.

â™ªâ™ª

Augh!
