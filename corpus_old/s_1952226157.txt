<i>Hi, this is Abby.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>

<i>so leave a message and I'll get</i>
<i>back to you as soon I can.</i>

<i>Thanks!</i>

<i>[beep]</i>

Hey, it's me.

I don't know if you're not
answering because, uh,

you're still at the funeral or because
you still don't wanna talk...

But, um, either way, I think you're, uh,

being pretty out of line

and totally unfair with all this.

You know, it's you that's making
this, this so uncomfortable -

not me... all right?

And, you know, I, I had,

I had just as much right
to be there as you.

And so what if she's your aunt?

You know, she's,
she's my aunt, too.

Just, uh... Just a, uh,

ex-aunt-in-law or whatever,
but so what?

You know, it was enough
to justify me being there.

And you didn't need to give me shit

because I brought carnations, O.K?

I didn't get them
because I was cheap.

I, I got them... I got them
because I actually thought

they were nice and,

and I didn't know
any better, all right?

Besides, if she had it her way,

she probably wouldn't want any
fucking flowers to begin with

considering how bad
her allergies are...

Or were, whatever.

And you know what?

You're one to talk, you know,
about tact.

The most tacky thing there was,

was you bringing your,
your cheesy-ass, uh, boy toy

on a hot date
to a fucking funeral, O.K?

That's pretty fucking tacky
if you ask me.

Which new guy is he?

Is he the... is he the one, uh,
with all the played-out tattoos?

The, um, the tribal arm band
and the, uh,

the Chinese symbol
for power and, uh,

Celtic and Egyptian shit that he...

Hello?

<i>[knocking]</i>

You guys wanted to see me?

Yeah, take a seat,
if you would.

Uh, we've got slight change
that we need to make.

Um, O.K.

We are going to need you
to let Alvin go.

Um...

Oh, you mean to, to fire him?

We're gonna need you
to let him go for us.

O.K., um...

What, uh, what, what for?

What happened?

Uh, just, just tell him that,
um, it wasn't working out,

that it wasn't, uh, it wasn't
a perfect match, um,

that the, uh, that,
the synergy was not... correct.

When do you want me to,
to tell him?

Right now would,
would be ideal.

And also, um,
you could then fill in, uh,

takin' over some
of his duties on the floor...

Would be great.

Well... that's not,
that's not what I do.

I, I mean, I'm...

I'm above that.

I mean, I, I don't...

I did that
a long time ago and, um...

Well, that's, that's just
not my scene.

Um, I mean, those guys...

Those guys, they're always

farting on each other and, and,

and lighting each others' farts

and endless, you know, and...

And calling each other
"bitch tits" and...

Sure, sure.

It means a lot to us,

your willingness to,
to help us out.

I mean, this is a tough thing,
you know.

Anytime a void is created, um,

it's tough on everyone...

Tough on us.

But is it, is it,
uh, temporary?

It's temporary for now.

It would be really terrific if you
could take care of that for us.

<i>[stall door squeaks]</i>

<i>[zipping sound]</i>

Hi, Alvin.
How's it goin'?

Um... Uh, Terry and Curtis,

uh, asked that I come,

uh, talk to you.

Um, I'm afraid that we
have to let you go.

You mean, like fired?

Yes.

No, like, uh...

Just, you know,
just letting you go.

Did they say why?

Um, mmm, just that it
wasn't working out.

Um... Look, I...

You know, I, I don't know why.

They didn't say why.

Um, I was pulling for you.

I'm just a puppet and, um,

you know, they told me

what to say and I'm just, you know,
regurgitating it to you.

And I'm, you know, I'm, I'm,

you know, right there with you on this.

I, I'm just...

You know,
just doin' what they say.

Uh-huh.

Um, do, do you think
they'd let me

finish takin' a shit first?

Yes, totally.

All right.

You know, I don't
want to rush you or anything.

You know, you can take...
as much time as you need.

Thanks.

Excuse me, uh...
Have you seen that cat?

Is this one yours?

Yeah, I'm afraid it is.

Why'd you call it Goliath?

Uh, it just seemed
like a cool name.

I don't know.

I got him
a long time ago.

Did he run away from you?

No, I doubt it, at least,
um, at least not intentionally.

He wouldn't do that.

I'm sure he's
just confused and, you know,

wandered away.

Uh, he's very happy.

He's really old.

If it's fancy, you think
maybe someone stole it?

Probably not.

He's you know,
he's a total sweetheart,

but he's, he's not
a show cat or a purebred

or anything like that, just...

I don't know.

This neighborhood
used to be good.

I've lived here about nine years.

Just last month I got my house
appraised and it went down 5%

because there's a sex offender
in the neighborhood now.

Man, I can't believe it.

Are you serious?

Yep.

Well... Where does he live?

A couple of blocks that way,
I think, in Sweetbriar.

I looked it up online
in the sex offender database.

It's weird.

I never thought, uh...

You know, anyone like that lived in,

lived in our area, you know?

It's terrible, is what it is.

It's just terrible.

Yeah, it's,
it's really strange.

Well, uh, thanks for
the information and, uh,

you know, I'm offering a reward,

so keep on the lookout,

you know, if you see anything.

Good luck.
Thank you.

<i>[gears whirring</i>

Get the balance!

Get him by the neck and pull...

I got him!

Put his head in your balls.

Suck a dick!

I just got a hand full of nut.

I got 25 bucks on Carlos.

Come on, Johnson.

Squeeze his head, squeeze his head.

Squeeze his head!

172 days without an accident.

Who's the master, now, fucker?

Say my name, bitch!
Say it!

Reach in there and grab it.

I was like, "Oh, fuck."

A friend of mine got
bit by a black widow on his dick.

Come on.

I've seen it.

I know what the fuck that is.
I love that movie.

Um, preparing...

I think he played football,
the last I heard of him.

Did she shave her beaver?

No, you just take it.

Yes, they do.

I'm just running a few minutes late.
I'm almost there.

I'll be there in a second, O.K?

<i>Uh-huh... O.K.</i>

O.K., all right.

Be there in a sec.
Bye.

<i>[wailing siren approaching]</i>

<i>[horn honks]</i>

It's a very popular place.

No, it's off of...

Wichita, I think.

No, I didn't hear,

but I'm glad that you told me

in case I run into them.

But only steak fingers.

<i>[door opens, shuts]</i>

Oh, the other guy...

He's here now.

All right.
I will talk to you later.

Yeah, tonight.
O.K., bye-bye.

How are you?

Sorry I'm late.

Do you know we're getting
charged by the hour, don't you?

We'll go halfsies
on it, don't worry.

Uh, let's see.

Where to begin?

O.K., you are gold...
and you'll be lime.

I need initials here and here

and signatures on these tabs.

O.K., exchange documents

and sign here, here,

and initial on these tabs.

Is that it?

<i>[car engine turns on,</i>
<i>horn honks]</i>

<i>[whistles]</i>

What?

Look, we're never
gonna come to a consensus

as to who did what first,
and that's fine, O.K?

But there's one thing
I wanna make clear.

For what it's worth, on my end,

lt... was just two fingers, O.K?

That's it, nothing.

And, um... so in my opinion,

a couple of fingers
don't count, all right?

Um... I just wanted to say that.

Disgusting.

I don't wanna hear it.
It's disgusting, gross.

And even, uh...

And even though it didn't work
out for you and that guy

in the long run, you know,

which is, uh, why I guess
you're now with that,

that tattooed gentleman...

You know, what you
did was, uh, out of love.

Your cheating -
it was out of love.

Mine was just out of dumb lust,

which barely counts, you know,
is nothing.

It may as well have been
with a piece of meat.

Seriously.

I mean, you know,
love is everything, O.K?

And so, so what I did

is like nothing
in comparison to you.

I mean, it was just
two fucking fingers.

Do you understand that?

Do you understand
how nothing that is?

Are you done?
Yeah, are you?!

I'm not trying
to change anything.

I'm just trying to say it, O.K?

Hey!

Hey, guess what...

I smoke inside
the house now!

The thing you do
is bet on a horse that pisses.

That's, like, the rule of thumb
because it's the lightest.

I'll tell you a terrible
pussy-eating story.

Have you heard of...

You know when people got
that bush-broom mustache?

Who's that guy
that played "Magnum P.I."?

Tom Selleck.

Tom Selleck.

They call that a nut duster.

A nut duster?

Yeah, that's what...

It's a good little
slang term for that type

of bush-broom mustache.

She said, "This is for Carlos,"
and took off her shirt.

And my friend, Brendon,
was filming her the whole time.

Later on, we went to
the eighth grade dance

and she showed up
and had someone

get me to come out there

and she was in, uh, an overcoat
with nothing underneath.

<i>[laughing, chattering]</i>

Look, when you drink tequila,
you get sick off tequila,

you know what I mean?

It takes seven years
for you to be able

to even smell the stuff again

because that's how long it takes
every cell of your body to...

You have one cell left in your body
that still didn't like tequila...

You go,
"Oh, I don't like it," whatever.

But all your fingernails,
your heart muscles,

every brain,
regenerates itself.

I have been here
for seven years.

That means, basically...

Where is he going?

Hey, where's he goin'?
Where's he fuckin' goin'?

Welcome to our world,
bitch tits!

Welcome to our world, bitch tits!

Come join the fun!

Everyone in the whole
neighborhood does.

You know, this used to be
a really nice place here.

Well, if you ask me,

this still is a really nice place...

if you have a positive attitude.

Is that all you came
over here for?

Y... Yes.

We've gotta go back inside
and finish doing my dishes...

if that's all right with you.

Whatever.

O.K., great... Idiot.

<i>Sabovich, private investigator.</i>

Hi, I've the...

the 2:30 appointment.

Um, uh... I'm looking
for the office...

But all I'm finding
at this address is a boutique.

<i>Yes, that's my wife's business.</i>

<i>Just go right through</i>
<i>the front and I'll be here.</i>

Oh... O.K.

Excuse me, um...

He's in the back.

O.K.

Hi, how are you?

Oliver Sabovich, P.I.

Nice to meet you.
Thank you for your time.

No problem.

I guess I should tell you up front

that... I have a, uh,

I have a coupon
from the phone book.

This is an ad,
not a coupon.

Really?

So how can I help you?

Well, um...

Basically I wanted to find out
about enlisting your services.

I have a cat that was

very dear to me, um, that...

was recently killed.

And I wanted to find out
what happened.

How was it killed?

By a car, you know,

by a person driving a car.

Near your house?

Uh, same general neighborhood, yeah.

I believe, uh, the car swerved,

uh, to intentionally...

hit the cat.

You know, presumably,
uh, murder.

Well, technically,
that's not murder.

Intentionally or unintentionally,
animals are killed.

Only humans can be murdered.

And, of course,

only very important humans
can be assassinated.

Look, I'm gonna be straight with you.

It's unfortunate, but this is not
the kind of thing that I cover.

I deal with more traditional things:

surveillance, insurance fraud, whatnot.

I don't mean to sound callous,

but this is just not
my cup of tea.

Road kill, that sort of thing
happens all the time.

It's just nature's way.

Well, I don't know if
this will make any, uh,

difference or not, but...

For what it's worth, I do have,

uh, a lead as to who I think

the culprit may be.

Then it seems like you
don't really need me after all.

<i>[copy machine rattling]</i>

Hey, how's it goin'?

Do you know about the tray
of non-dairy creamers

we keep by the wall
in the break room?

Uh, yeah?

Well, it seems that
someone went in

and decided to
squeeze them really hard,

exploding them
and makin' a big mess.

Do you know anything about that?

Uh, no.

Are you sure?

Yeah, um...
But I don't know.

You might wanna go ask
the, uh, the other guys.

Well, you see, we took a look

at the security camera footage

and we happened to see
you in the break room,

squeezing these creamers hard
and exploding them.

What do you have
to say about that?

Do you wanna talk about it?

No, no.

It's O.K.

Well, Juanita had to go
into the break room

and clean up that big mess.

It was a pain for her,
very unfortunate.

Well, you know,
I'm sure that was lousy.

Yeah, it is.

Uh...
Well, anyway,

if you need me,
I'll be in my office.

Feel free to call me,

send me an e-mail
or contact me in any other way.

Again, we're all disappointed in you.

So why don't you just stand here

and think about this for a while.

O.K.

O.K., so what happened to him?

Were you fucking with me

or did something
really go wrong?

He's fine, O.K?

Now, why don't you just stick
to your restraining order

Why did you kill him?

He was such a sweet fucking cat.

He never did anything wrong!

He never crapped
or peed in the house.

He never scratched
on the furniture.

He was really goddamn sweet.

Why did you fucking do that?

He was all I had left.
