[man 1 speaking in Arabic]
What happened?

[man 2] The lights went out.
[man 1] Why?

[man 3] This is normal.

[man 1] The lights are
out all over the world.

The lights are
out all over Egypt.

Everything is like this,
it's not just the electricity.

Electricity is the least
of our problems.

And all the little kids

in the streets say,
"Turn the lights back on, man."

Who is the "man"?

The man who's responsible

for switching the electricity
back on.

The regime.

[man 1] Are you recording?
[man 2] Yes.

Really recording?

Yes.

OK. Do as you like.

[Ahmed speaking in Arabic] - Let me
tell you how this whole story began.

Egypt was living
without dignity.

Injustice existed
everywhere.

Before the revolution,

I lived from one job
to the next.

I started working
when I was eight years old.

In fifth grade, I used
to pay my school tuition

by selling lemons
in the street.

There was no hope for a
better future in this country.

We were tied down by

an unjust regime and
its dictator.

Mubarak was the head
of the regime

that forced us to live for
30 years under emergency law.

I lived my entire life
under Mubarak's injustice.

The regime always
worked against the people.

They would torture,

electrocute, beat the
shit out of people.

No one dared to speak
about politics.

Politics was for
the regime only.

[groaning on video]

Oh, my God, people.

We want to go
to Tahrir Square.

If we have any dignity and

want to live as humans
in this country,

then we have to
go to the streets.

We will go down and demand
our fundamental human rights.

I am going down and I will say

"no" to corruption, "no" to
this regime.

[Ahmed] I went to the

streets.
[whistling]

I found everyone around me

felt just as I did.
[crowd chanting in Arabic]

want to end corruption!


[chaotic shouts]

divide us with all they had.

[shouting]
[gunfire]

[sirens wailing]

[chatter in Arabic]

[Ahmed] People got angry...
[indistinct shouts]

...and broke their fears.
[rocks banging]

We were all present.
We were one hand.


One hand!

One hand!

We will fill the world
with our poetry.

Our words will
stand in the Square.

And they will be
like bullets in this war.

Revolution until victory!
[crowd chanting]

Revolution on
every street in Egypt!

Leave, Mubarak!

[crowd chanting]


realised that people are
the true power.

Every five seconds,
thousands join the sit-in.

We won't leave the Square
until our demands are met.

We've never
had our rights.

Finally, we have this piece
of land to call our own

and to claim
our rights on.

And now, it's ours.

It's not too much
to ask for.

Tahrir Square is nothing

compared to the thousands
of acres they stole.

Tea, anyone?

Tea, anyone?

Magdy.

I told you we'd have
some tea together.

You, too, have some tea.

If I were to talk on behalf
of some of the Islamists...

Who's to say who's
an example of Islam?

The ideas we've
adopted since the start

of the revolution
are beautiful.

The idea that
we're one society.

To imagine that one day I would
be standing in Tahrir Square

in solidarity with all these
people, I could never have imagined it.

[woman speaking English]

At first, we were just
sleeping on newspapers.

And we didn't have any
blankets, only a few.

And only a few

people slept in.

Now, it's turning into some

community. It's more tents.

Relationships are
becoming very strong.

We're waiting for him
to resign tonight.

Waiting, waiting, waiting.

I don't know,
we're all very nervous.

[speaking in Arabic]

[in Arabic] I don't have any
cigarettes left.

Take this one.

[speaks English]
I'm just waiting for the speech.

You don't normally
get so much time

to try and work out where
you're going to be standing

when something
historic happens,

and the bastard
is making us wait.

[Anderson Cooper]
The protestors I talked to before I left

were very concerned
literally for their lives

if they left that Square.

The Secret Police, - the intelligence
apparatus is still in place,

still taking people and could

pick them off one by one

when they return

to their homes.

Khalid, you're

a famous actor.

Do you worry about talking

like you have been?

About being in

with the protestors?

Do you worry that

you could be targeted?

Well, I...

I don't care.


I mean, I know

why I'm here

and I know why

I want to be here.

I mean, I come from...

I come from three generations
who've been fighting

for social reform and political

freedoms in this country.

And here we have
the discourse of democracy,

of freedom, of social justice,
of political reform

being changed in the
Middle East for all of us.

And I'm extremely proud
to be here for those reasons.

[speaking in Arabic]
God be with you.

I am telling you,
good things are coming.

Good things.

Thank God.

[speaking English] - Usually, the
Muslim Brotherhood is our biggest fear.

But everyone inside
the Square now is different.

After the government turned

it into a life or death
situation,

enough, it didn't matter
who you are and what you are doing.

And everyone knows that you're

here, and if you're here,
you're willing to die.

[speaking in Arabic] We are
doing this for our children.

Even if I die,
it's for the future.

So now that Mubarak is gone,
we have to take control.

[speaking in English]
The main thing is taking the regime down.

Whoever is negotiating
with them...

The regime is already down.

If you take out people
and put people just like them

from the same circle,
from the same regime,

then you didn't take down the
regime, you took down people.

You're absolutely right.

[man speaking in Arabic]
No one is going to kill you.

I told you before.
[chatter in Arabic]

The Army will sacrifice
their last drop of blood

before they fire a single
bullet on the people.

Never.
[crowd applauding]

Now, please pack
your things and go home.

stepped down...

...the Armed Forces took
over the country's affairs.

They swore to God to meet
the people's demands.

So people went home.

And nothing happened.

We didn't put the killers on
trial or change the government.

There is no new constitution,

and the Secret Police are still
in power.

The regime is
not just Mubarak.

The regime is all
the country's institutions,

and they all have to change.

So we went back
to the Square.

We're entering Tahrir Square,
the place of pride and dignity,

where a tent and a blanket
can solve all your problems.

[man singing]
? We'll keep protesting! ?

[crowd singing]
? We'll keep protesting! ?

we're not going anywhere! ?

we're not going anywhere! ?

our revolution! ?

our revolution! ?

[speaking English] - The main way
of communicating is through slogans.

[singing in Arabic] - ? Our
revolution is a people's revolution! ?

is a people's revolution! ?

[man] ? Not a coalition's
revolution nor a party's revolution! ?

[Khalid speaking English]
The expectation at first was

that he would go and then we'd - all
move on or find a way of doing things.

Now, if he just goes and someone
comes in his place and we have

the whole same regime underneath

him, then we have a major
problem.

It just becomes, we did all of

this in order to just to remove
him

and put someone exactly
like him in his place.

If we still have a police state,
if we still have emergency law,

if we still have
the constitution

pretty much the
same as it is,

then if we had an election
in six months' time,

the situation would
pretty much be the same

because the tools
of the state remain the same.

[slow-tempo song]

in the state of Tahrir.

It has its housing department.

It has its borders,
it has its army.

the Islamist, and the old
regime led by the Army.

The Army has won
part of this revolution.

[speaking in Arabic] - They wanted to
stop Mubarak's son from inheriting power.

Once that happened, they wanted
people to go back home,

and the country to go back
to its corrupt ways.

[speaking in Arabic]

I'll tell you again,
I have a responsibility.

I feel it,
as an individual,

that I have to insist
on my point of view,

because there is still one
more centimetre I could gain.

Even if it's just one
centimetre, one inch.

[Hossam speaking in Arabic] - The Army
are the leaders of the counter-revolution.

[in English] You've already won
a lot, and it is threatened.

[crowd chattering in Arabic]
This is a warning.

Leave! Go home.

If you don't leave,
I will shoot you.

Egyptians do not
revolt easily.

For us to revolt, it means
we've had enough. Enough!

We'll free our country,
no matter what.

And we'll take
down the regime.

The people are determined
to continue their revolution.

Do whatever you want to us.

We're staying,
this is our Square.

The people are the source
of authority, not the Army.

it's a peaceful protest.

You think you can
do whatever you want

and we won't attack you.

But we will attack
if necessary.

That's how it is.
That's the end of it.

[man] You're imposing a

curfew?
Yes, God willing.

[man] You mean just in

the Square?
No, everywhere.


Mister,
I'm afraid this won't do.

[man] But they told us - yesterday, we
could continue the sit-in in the Square.

Off you go. Leave.
Yes, sir.

Why the Square in particular?
[crowd chattering]

barricades from the police,

so we'd be able
to stop any attack.

We do trust the Army. But there
are some leaders in the Army

who are corrupt because
they are part of Mubarak's era.

Everyone's awake.

There might be an
attack at any time.

[low chatter in Arabic]

[horns honking]

[choatic shouting]

[shouting in Arabic]


There are no tents,
they're clearing the Square.

What's going on?


[crowd shouting]

[gunfire]
[chaotic chatter]

[overlapping chatter
in Arabic]

They used to come
in the middle of the night.

They used to
take you away violently.

You were afraid to dream

the wrong dream for fear
of punishment.

They used to search
his computer,

looking for anything

religious or Islamic.

They used to come,
and no one could say a word.

[Khalid speaking English]
He was electrocuted and beaten.

The Army's in this position,
generally, at the moment

where no one
believes that they

could torture people
or could do anything bad

and are extremely happy with
them for taking responsibility

to return us all to stability
and all of that kind of thing.

This is not the right way
to block a facility

that represents
the authority of the nation.

Compare it to what
happened in England.

When David Cameron said,

I'm going to take licence
to use the ammunition

against anyone trying to make
a kind of demonstration

in front of Downing Street
or any facility.

What happened?
All of them withdraw.

Why? Because they know
the man is serious.

And this is according
to the law.

So why do you deny it
from the Egyptian authority?

the rocks and stones.

The battle is in the images.

The battle is in the stories.

[overlapping chatter in Arabic]

Shh!
[chatter continues]

[speaking in Arabic] We decided
to create a space which supports

those fighting
for the revolution

through video
and various types of media.

It's what's called
"popular media,"

using websites like YouTube.

If you know anyone who
has a digital camera

they're not using, tell us.

We should film
as much as we can.

The truth is that things
are moving quickly.

We don't know when this footage
can be used as evidence.

If people are being fooled about
what is really happening here,

we must film everything
and show them the truth.

As long as there's a camera,
the revolution will continue.

The problem now with the media

is that they oppose change

and turn people
against the revolution.

So, what will you do?

Well, I am going
to keep exposing them.

And they'll keep
exposing themselves.

Until the corrupt
media falls.

What are you going to do?
Start a television station?

Yes, hopefully I will.

Well, you'll have to put it

in Cyprus or else they will
destroy it.

[speaking in English] So you'll
need a massive amount of money.

[speaking in Arabic] Yours,
because your people are poor.

And who is this democracy
and freedom for?

The poor and underprivileged.

Give others a chance to speak.
Please go ahead.

No. Carry on, Ahmed.
[all chattering]

God give you strength.

[overlapping chatter]

[man singing prayer song
in Arabic]

I missed you.
I missed you a lot.

How are you?
Good.

There's a massive
turnout today.

[prayer continues in Arabic]

But it's a different

crowd today.
Meaning?

There's a big presence
of Muslim Brotherhood.

More than the last week?
For sure.

Yes, the Brotherhood
wasn't here last week.

were told to be here today.

It's been said that
the Muslim Brotherhood

made a deal
with the Army.

This is what's
being said.

Honestly, I'm upset about their
political tactics and games.

They should not
be here for

a political agenda
or gains.

Some Brotherhood leaders make
secret deals with the Army

and use their presence in the
Square as a negotiating tool.

You know I think
this is wrong.

[crowd chanting]

The Quran is
our constitution!

Islamic rule!


started yelling, "Islamic rule,
Islamic rule."

What do they mean by Islamic?
Aren't we Muslims too?

The Brotherhood began to use

the Square to negotiate
with the Army.

They're not calling
for the people's demands.

But for their
political demands.

The Brotherhood ruined
the sit-in.

amongst everyone in the Square.

They are exhausting
everyone with their lies.

Thank you.

What are you going to eat?
I have some.

When the Brotherhood
are active,

people say they are
hijacking the revolution.

But the Brotherhood existed
long before the revolution.

But you change your statements
based on where you are.

In Cairo, you say you
a want secular state.

In other areas, you say
you want a religious one.

You are the biggest supporters

of the Military Council,
standing against us.

You speak in the name

of religion to get what
you want.

You contradict your
statements all the time.

Hold on, look at this.

you were beaten in the past.

No, not beaten. We've spent
our lives in prison cells.

The Muslim Brotherhood
has damaged the image of Islam.

I am embarrassed of being
a Muslim because of you.

The Brotherhood has
hijacked the revolution,

OK, where's your film?

No, you did.

Yeah, yeah.

Your ID.

Open the camera.

Show me the camera.

[man yelling] I want to see
your ID. - [gunshot nearby]

Don't step outside.

[speaking English] I lived in

the '70s in England when IRA
people or any demonstration

were also beaten up,

and electrified

and they twisted their arms

and I don't know what.

A special machine
to put their fingers in.

So, what I'm supposed to

accept that?
No, no, you are not.

No, you are not supposed to - accept, but
you are supposed to weigh in on things.

I am weighing in things,
I'm weighing in things.

You seem to take
a few things for granted.

[indistinct chatter]

Well, this is why we want to get
rid of them as soon as possible.

And to say that the people
are not ready to vote

is just very condescending
and wrong.

[Khalid] I'm not against people
voting however the way they want.

[speaking in Arabic]
Yeah, I know you don't agree.

[in English] The difference - between me
and you and many of the young people...

[Khalid in Arabic] You want
parliamentary elections in two months?

Yes, I want people to vote.
In two months?

Yes, yes. [in English]
As soon as possible.

There are no decent parties.
OK, so what?

Because you've been living
in a vacuum for 30 years.

OK, you've been living
for the 30 years.

Yet people are complaining that
the Muslim Brotherhood will win.

[speaking in Arabic]
Fuck this.

[in English] And they have been
living in the same vacuum.

Yet they do have a following.

You could only start making
parties a week ago.

Humanity has not discovered
anything better

for representation
than elections.

If we don't have this
as soon as possible...

Elections that happen under
circumstances in which

you can have proper elections.
No.

It's about there being
a voice that is there...

Between the ex-regime
as a major power force

and the Brotherhood
as a major power force.

Where is anything in - the middle? Who
is...? What is there in the middle?

Who do they vote for? - Who do they
vote for? - [overlapping dialogue]

Tell me at least
who they can vote for.

I believe that the millions
who made this happen,

I believe that the majority
of them were not people

who wanted the old regime - and were
not people who wanted the Brotherhood.

I am so fucking scared
of the moment

a lieutenant or a brigadier
general or something

will say,
"Enough of this rubbish.

We are back to military
rule completely."

It is in their interest that it
disintegrates into chaos.

It is in their interest to say,

"OK, you people.
Enough law and order."

[casual whistling]

[horn honking]

[speaking in Arabic]

Enough of this. All the
politicians are failures.

The Muslim Brothers,
the Salafis, the Socialists,

the Liberals,
they're all failures.

I've decided to walk in
the middle of the street.

The cars can do
whatever they want.

What can they do?
Run me over?

They need to curb
to the side, not me.

I will stand my ground.

Go away.

Enough walking cautiously
on the side.

We managed to kick them

out and the prosecutors
left with them.

Now we're waiting for the
families to make a decision,

whether they do the autopsies
or bury the bodies immediately.

Without the autopsy evidence,
there'll be a big problem.

They'll be able to say,
"Oh, they died in a stampede."

They have to do autopsies.
They have to be filmed.

Because there are clear

marks that they were
run over by tanks.

They summarised all you wrote,

and said he died from
a bullet in the chest.

Stay here.
I'll get you the report.

[chatter in Arabic]

[overlapping shouts]
[shrill whistle]

we've been in this mess.

In this shit, in this

country, because of
every time we keep silent.

We can't stay silent.
We have to keep the pressure on.

We might not win this time,
but maybe next time.

People must know
they will be punished

and be afraid of that.

People can't take it anymore.

They're losing their nerves.

The Egyptian regime was

able to fool both Muslims
and Christians.

They want to suffocate us.

If it remains stuck
in our minds

that it's a sectarian problem,
that will be a crisis.

The Army wants this to happen.

The Army wants to divide us.

There is an old saying:

"Divide and conquer."
[man] Exactly.

They want to divide
Muslims and Christians.

you not to go to protests?

"I won't go.
I'll do as you say, Mom."

But you tricked me and went,
and took your life away from me.

"If I died a martyr, Mom,
would you be sad for me, Mom?"

I'm not sad for
the martyr in you.

But losing you hurts,
my love.

I'm not sad for the martyr
in you, my love.

I'm not sad for the martyr

in you, my love.

[speaking in Arabic]

Our parting hurts, Mina.

[no audible dialogue]

[no audible dialogue]

[no audible dialogue]

[chanting in Arabic]

Our Army is firing at us!

A new revolution all over
again!

Live free or die heroes!

[overlapping dialogue]
Our Army has protected you!

And protected the revolution!

The Army didn't protect
the revolution.

The Army protected
their interests,

but betrayed
the revolution!

Betrayed the revolution!
Protected!

Betrayed the revolution!
Betrayed the revolution!

Betrayed the revolution!
The Army betrayed the revolution!

So you are right
and all of us are wrong?

[overlapping shouts]
Betrayed the revolution!

the fall of the military regime!

live bullets at us.

[overlapping shouts]

every corner of the Square.

[indistinct shouts]


People were falling one by one.

Just because they were saying,
"Down with military rule."

[chaotic shouting]
[gunfire]

[sirens wailing]


The good and free people
are being called traitors...

...while the traitors
are called heroes.

[sirens wailing]

[all shouting]

It was too much.
Too many bullets.

[overlapping gunfire]

[crowd shouting]

Our Army is killing us.

They can't be Egyptians!

They forgot Egypt!

[overlapping chatter]



Death always knocks on my door.

Knocking on my head.

[low chatter in Arabic]

[speaking English]
I'm trying to do a daily report.

[woman] You going to

get it out online?
Yes.

[man] I think we can

cut into the...
[low chatter]

[crowd chanting in Arabic
in distance]

[man speaking English] - The Muslim
Brotherhood has not really participated

in these protests whatsoever.

They want the elections
to go forward as planned

because they stand
to gain the most from them,

and they are being

severely accused by
the revolutionary youth

Hey, kiddo, are you OK?

[loud bangs]


[overlapping chatter]


[chatter in Arabic]

Is it a bullet?

A bullet?

Is it a bullet?
Or a rock?

Can I have some bandages?


[woman] Why is there all

this blood?
[man] Why all this blood?

hospital and people are dying.

Even the doctors are dying.

I think it's nerve gas.
You collapse and convulse.

Did you film any of this?
I filmed but then I fell.

You couldn't take it?

I was shaking and suffocating.
Everyone was.

The patients have to be moved,
or they will die.

[overlapping chatter]

[woman 1]
These are being thrown at us.

This is what is making us
fall to the ground.

[woman 2] America?


[man speaking English] These

battles have been raging not
for hours, but for days.

been killed, hundreds injured.

A video uploaded yesterday on
YouTube has circulated widely,

provoked outrage at the extent
of police brutality.

[speaking in Arabic] General

Tantawi denied that any live
bullets have been fired.

Glorious people of Egypt.

What we are witnessing

now on the streets
and television

are just accusations

attempting to smear the image
of the military.

The Armed Forces
will move forward

with parliamentary
elections as planned.

Presidential elections

will take place before
the end of June 2012.

It's the first time
he dares speak to us!

[overlapping shouts from

crowd]
[sirens wailing in distance]

[speaking English]
Hello, can you hear me?

I have no fear about the
future of this country.

I have fear for a future of

this country which includes
the military,

and a military that wants
to be above the rule of law,

a military that wants
to be above the constitution,

a military that doesn't want
to tell us how much money

they're stealing from this

country, a military
that is receiving aid

in the millions - and billions
from the US and other governments.

[overlapping shouts]

[line ringing]

[woman speaks Arabic]
Hi, Ahmed.

How did you know it was me?

you're my sweetheart.

[Ahmed chuckles] So quickly
you said, "Hello, Ahmed."


A revolution that
removed a regime, OK?

Before the people
destroyed it.

the revolution?

We didn't protect

the revolution,
we made it happen.

You kids don't
know anything.

[chatter in Arabic on TV]

I was beaten
with boots and sticks.

I'm bruised from being
beaten all over my body.

I've lived in the military
world for 40 years.

I am honestly telling

you the Armed Forces
are not like this. At all.

You've been entrusted

with a nation's security.
It's your duty.

So all I'm asking is,

how can I entrust a nation
to those who can't even protect a woman?

Even if I am your

brother, at some point,
I must be tough on you.

I don't understand why.
Why?

When the Army first came

to the streets,
people climbed on tanks

and hugged the soldiers
and clapped for them.

What then? Why?
What's wrong with you?

I swear to you, Ghada, - one day you'll
say you met General Hamdy Bekheit,

and he told you
the following:

None of the guilty
will get away with it.

Whatever happens.
I promise you.

This is a picture of a friend
who took a bullet in his leg.

This is not
an Army bullet.

It doesn't look like one.

The most beautiful thing
about our Square

is that everyone who comes here
follows his conscience,

not some political force.

And that's what
makes us strong.

We're here presenting Cinema

Tahrir to remind us why
we are here,

and to show the people who
ask us why we're still here.

Because only we
can tell our stories.

who toppled the regime

have died, been injured,
or gone to prison.

And with no constitution,

they want to hold elections
stained by revolutionary blood,

supervised by those
who killed the revolutionaries.

And they made two ballot boxes.

One for the killer,
and one for the traitor.

Our voices will keep getting
higher and higher,

because the streets
are our ballot boxes.

[horns honking]

[man speaking English] - The next Egyptian
president will either be an Islamist

from the Muslim - Brotherhood
or Mubarak's last prime minister,

and that has left
many of the so-called revolutionaries

with a very tough choice
in a very close race.

[speaking in Arabic]
I don't want either.

We're stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

We'll have to accept
whatever happens.

[chatter on TV]

Everyone keep
your voices down.

[man on TV]
With 51.73 percent,

13 million,
230 thousand and 131...

Listen up!

we have the same problems.

It's crazy, we made a revolution
and no new constitution.

We got a president
without a constitution.

The most important thing
is the new constitution.

And now it's under
their control.

Religion is the biggest problem
we will face in this next phase,

because we have
a new political power

that also claims it's
a religious organisation,

a missionary force,
and this is a disaster.


But I hate
the Brotherhood.

They made shitty decisions,
and we're in a shitty situation.

You need to be patient.

For how long?

The President is a man who
I trust with my religion.

Can't I trust him
with my politics too?

This is the constitution
of the Brotherhood.

We are Egyptian citizens.

We are not
Brotherhood citizens.

You were against torture,
and now you're torturing.

Against corruption,
and now you're corrupt.

Who brought
Morsi into power?

[Ahmed] The people.
The people.

Because they felt

you guys were an
oppressed people.

This document will allow what
happened to you to happen to me.

Do you accept that?
Of course not.

OK, then take this constitution.
It doesn't serve me.

I hated what they did

to you. I went to the
streets because of it.

Why did we go to the street?

Wasn't it to protest
against police brutality?

The Secret Police
that tortured you?

You are allowing the

Secret Police to do
the same thing to me.

And you're saying
"yes" to this.

[crowd chanting in Arabic]

The people demand
the fall of the regime!

of our revolution.

We got rid of Mubarak,
then the military.

Now the focus is on
the Brotherhood.

[speaking English] It is a - bigger
challenge, because it will include more blood.

When you're fighting your

own people, it's different
from fighting the regime.

Because, after all,

even if the regime was
extremely violent and vicious,

and if they used all the

weapons they had, it's still
not as vicious

as when the people fight each
other. It's very different.

[speaking in Arabic]

In the name of God, I am
directing this to the people

who have resorted

to violence.

The time has come
for the law

to judge them
and punish them.

He's ordering his people

to attack us. That's the
message behind his speech.

Go to the streets and
attack the hell out of them.

[crowd shouting]

[horns honking]

[man shouting in Arabic]

[honking horn]

The Brotherhood has been
fucking with us for two years.

I didn't see you
today at all.

No one has given him a chance.

My butcher the other day yelled,
"Goddamn you, Morsi."

I asked why. He said,
"Because it is so hot." - [low chuckles]

Is this a joke? - If there were
alternatives, I wouldn't want Morsi.

Honestly, we don't care
about Mubarak or Morsi.

We just want a decent
man to rule with justice.

I don't care if he's a Jew.

We're afraid that
if Morsi falls,

we will be taken
back to prisons.

Why all the focus on the

Brotherhood and how
horrible the President is?

The revolutionaries were your
friends. You lived with them.

There is a fog in the country.
[woman] No, Magdy.

You abandoned one side
and chose the other.

I didn't abandon.

I chose the side that I

grew up with, that I felt
was supporting me.

Magdy has five children.
How does he provide for them?

The Muslim Brotherhood.

All the time Magdy
was playing revolutionary,

being filmed, shot at,
jailed, what did he gain?

Where did that get him?

I never thought
we'd all be divided

into the Brotherhood
and other groups.

I'm sad. Nothing has
changed for my dad.

from the revolution.

I still can't
get health care.

It's OK.
[all chuckling]

It's OK.

These are the gains
of the revolution.

She's filled
with tears.

It's OK.
Everything will be all right.

Protests continue in Egypt as

the country's top
opposition leaders

renew calls to topple
the Islamist regime.

will be an open-ended

strike across Egypt
on the 30th of June.

A grassroots campaign

has gathered over
18 million signatures.

They hope to install
a transitional government

and call early
presidential elections.

Muslim Brotherhood officials,
for their part,

have said that many of

those coming out on
June 30th are thugs.

[man speaking Arabic]
Our beloved President,

may God make June 30th
a day of pride for Islam

and a day of doom - for the hypocrite
opposition. - [crowd cheering]

May you destroy them all.

Defeat them and make us win.
[crowd shouting] Amen.

Protect us from their evils.
[crowd] Amen.

President Morsi
is a line you don't cross.

[man] Meaning?
Meaning, if you threaten him,

we'll spill your blood.
Meaning?

Meaning, he's the legitimate
elected President.

But they're going to the
streets to take him down.

They can go to hell.

Why? It's their right.
No, It's not their right.

[crowd chanting] Freedom!

Freedom!


Revolution is not simply
replacing a regime.

Revolution is a
culture of a people.

You give them
ownership of their freedom.

That's what we gained.

We were able to introduce
the culture of protesting.

your friends, Khalid and Ahmed?

but I'm assigned here now.

They told me I need to stay.

I don't want to stand with
one side against the other,

and it could result in death.
Understand?

[woman] Aren't you sad?
Of course.

That your friends
are on the opposite side?

Who am I attacking? Am I going
to attack Khalid Abdalla?

Or Pierre who used
to host me in his apartment?

The President's speech
was not satisfactory

to the people's demands.

Early presidential elections
will be held.

The head of the constitutional

court will be the
interim President

until a new President
is elected.

[crowd cheering]

Long live Egypt!
Long live Egypt!

Long live Egypt!

[inaudible dialogue]

Morsi has fallen.
So did the Army and Mubarak.

We're waiting
for the next one.

This is our life now,
we'll stay in the street.

I want to go home
and sleep.

[cheering]
[chattering in Arabic]

what are we going to do now?


to God, I'm at the Brotherhood
sit-in.

We may or may not be massacred.
It doesn't matter.

If you're meant to die,

it's going to happen
wherever you are.

The more they kill, the
more we believe in our cause.

deaths

[man 2]
A massacre by all means.

Magdy, as much as I've
been violent in words,

that was just
anger speaking.

You're challenging our belief

Honestly, I want

After all, this revolution was

And you and I agree.

We want the best

You shouldn't come here.

You shouldn't come here.

[Ahmed]
No, forget it, I'm coming.

What will they do? Kill me?
That's up to God's will.

And if I die I'll just
blame it on you, Magdy.

I'm not here to die or to kill.

You know my intentions.

I swear, I know that, Magdy.

[all singing in Arabic]

? Freedom is coming,
that's for sure ?

? "Liberty" was written
in our destiny ?

[singing continues]

? They said, riots are
in our blood ?

? And how dare we claim
our rights? ?

[all singing] ? Freedom ?


[crowd cheering]

[chatter in Arabic]

[slow song playing]


? Where were you long ago? ?

? With you we sung
and with you we suffered ?

? We've prayed and
we've been scared ?

? United day and night ?

? Nothing is
impossible with you ?

? The sound of freedom
is gathering us ?

? And our lives
finally have meaning ?

? No turning back ?

? Our voices are
finally heard ?

? And the dream
is no longer forbidden ?


? Where were you long ago? ?

? You've destroyed the walls
and let in the light ?

? You gathered the
broken people around you ?

? We've been reborn ?

? And our determined
dream was born ?

? We have our differences
but our intentions are pure ?

? Even when the picture
wasn't clear ?

? Honouring our country
and our grandchildren ?

? And the rights that have
been stolen from our youth ?

? Oh, the Square ?

? Where were you long ago? ?

something for the first time ?

? But since then
we grew apart ?

? We have to change ourselves
with our own hands ?

? You gave us so much
and now it's our turn ?

that you become a memory ?
