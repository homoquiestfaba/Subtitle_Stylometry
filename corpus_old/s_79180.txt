<i>Winning this case--</i>
<i>it's a real victory, Sabrina.</i>

<i>You ain't got</i>
<i>to tell me that, Mr. Riddles.</i>

I know.

Man.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

There's a lot of young people
going to prison these days.

Some of 'em need to be there.

Some of 'em don't.

It's-- it's the background story
that's the real winner.

That's what everybody's
gonna want to hear.

Prison ain't no joke, though.

Want to know how I know?
'Cause I been in and out of jail

since I was 15 years old.

But there ain't <i>nothing</i> like
the experience I had at Whitehead.

I know what you want,

but I'm gonna tell you
the story my way.

I lived this.

Being in this motherfucker
changed my life.

<i>Damn,</i>
<i>look at my nails.</i>

<i>You know I gets my shit done</i>
<i>every week.</i>

Don't play.

Damn. Shit, bitch,
you need to be looking at that hair.

Fuck you, fuck y'all.

First of all,
y'all motherfuckers is crazy,

'cause you ain't gonna be getting
that shit done no time soon.

Nails, hair, toes--
none of that shit.

You gonna be scraping them
up against the wall and shit.

What did y'all--
y'all niggas kill somebody?

<i>- Hell yeah.</i>
<i>- I went and shot him.</i>

Hell no, I ain't
killed me nobody.

They got the wrong motherfucker.
They got the wrong Sabrina Downs.

It could be like 13 of me
in the whole fucking world.

There's a bunch of motherfuckers
in America.

I know motherfuckers light-skinned
and wear braids and shit like me.

Everybody want to put
me in jail.

Bitch, I will jump over this
motherfucker and choke your ass.

What's up?
Bitch, oh my--

wait till we get to the prison.
You just wait.

You ain't gonna do shit.
She says she ain't killed nobody.

Y'all want to be innocent ass?
You ain't done shit either, bitch.

You picking some cotton
some-motherfucking-where

<i>and got in trouble.</i>
<i>You just here 'cause...</i>

<i>they want your ass here.</i>
<i>You ain't special.</i>

Hey, if you, like,
hold your arms back...

God, girl.

Thanks.

It's cool.

And that's how I met
Frances Shepard.

Officer:
From this moment on,

you're the property of the Whitehead
Correctional Institution.

My name is Captain Alan Dease.

Remember my name,
and I promise you

you will never forget
my face.

All right, ladies,
listen up.

You will not be able
to eat, sleep,

or go to the bathroom...

without permission.

And I'm gonna say this once

and only once--

carry your prison ID
with you at all times.

Failure to do so will result
in disciplinary action.

You shall not engage
in gambling,

substance abuse,
or illegal sexual acts.

<i>Tom Nelson</i>
<i>was the warden, right?</i>

But that asshole Dease?
He ran the prison.

You shall not
engage in business

or commerce of any type.

He's seen, like, four or five
wardens come and go.

He been there
for a long time.

That nigga felt like
everything was his,

from the fucking roof
to the rats.

You will not destroy
or misuse state property.

Dease? Asshole.

For sure.

Any acts...

of insurrection

or insubordination

will result
in disciplinary action.

Do you understand?

Yes, sir.
Do you understand?!

Yes, sir!

Good.

Good, ladies.

<i>We was, like, his girls</i>

<i>living in his</i>
<i>motherfucking house.</i>

It was real fucked up.

Turn off the damn music.

<i>Now Frances was different</i>
<i>than the rest of us.</i>

New inmate on the block.

<i>She had never</i>
<i>been in jail before.</i>

<i>Neither has Lil' Mama--</i>

<i>17, pregnant,</i>
<i>and our resident preacher.</i>

Nikki, this here is Frances Shepard.
Lock her in to the day-to-day.

I don't want her in here.
You don't have a choice.

All she gonna learn from me
is how to be an insubordinate.

Right.

<i>I hope you'll be comfortable.</i>
<i>You can put your stuff up there.</i>

Maybe I'll help you make your bed
later. Clear out some space.

Look, I know how you feel.
It just takes time.

Here, let me tell you
who everybody is.

<i>That right there,</i>
<i>that's Nikki.</i>

Don't nobody mess with her. She's
been in and out of here two times.

Everybody here's scared of her
except me.

We get along.
Now it's a little cold in here.

They don't give us no heat, so you
might want to dress up a little bit

so you don't get sick, okay?
Frances. How you doing? I'm Wet.

Come on out of that cell, girl.
You gonna spend enough time there.

Enough time to make you
go crazy.

Now this here's
kinda like the block.

You got to be careful
who you run with.

See them girls right there?
That's the Nikki Nikki crew.

Now if that's your thing,
it's cool with us.

Them girls right there--
that's the Hotep Girls.

<i>- Hotep!?</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

That's my click.
It's our job to wake everybody up.

<i>Shut the fuck up and leave</i>
<i>that new bitch alone!</i>

Shut the fuck up, bitch.

You see what I'm saying?
"Sleep-itude."

What you up in here for?

Murder.
Murder?

<i>Don't look like a murderer.</i>

Look like a high-yellow
"saditty" bitch to me.

Now look, Frances,
we get up every morning at 5:30.

Then we got shower time--
No, Lil' Mama. Fuck that.

What she need to know is how they
terrorize us in this motherfucker.

You gotta protect yourself.

I didn't do anything.

It don't matter.

I got this here petition
that I need you to sign.

I'm trying to get everybody
to sign it, actually.

Where my pen?

<i>- Lockdown, two minutes.</i>
Okay.

<i>- Two minutes to lockdown.</i>
All right, y'all.

Come on.
See you later, Wet.

All right, Frances.

They can't pay me enough to work
in this raggedy motherfucker.

Shit is crazy. You know Yvette
got bit by a rat the other night?

For real?
<i>- What?</i>

Keep down about it. You don't want
to give 'em no reason

<i>to throw us in lockdown.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

Lockdown?
That shit ain't never gonna happen.

Slow down their productivity.

That's right. We gotta keep
the cash flowing.

Frances, let me let you in
on what's going on.

Saturday, we're in the sweat shop
all day until 12:00 noon.

Then it's hour in the yard,
then it's chow,

then it's back to cleaning up,
unloading the truck,

<i>helping with dinner.</i>
<i>We only get an hour on the phone.</i>

We only get paid $1.50 a day.
I know it don't sound right,

but that's the way it is.
No, that can't be right.

That's illegal.
Hell no, that shit ain't legal.

Slave-driving motherfuckers.

All right, ladies,
time to earn your keep.

Welcome to the plantation,
Sister Frances.

So Frances,
what happened with you?

How'd you get in here?

I killed my husband,
but it was an accident.

Oh really?

Huh. I killed my stepfather,
but it wasn't no accident.

You got any kids?

Yeah, I have one.
Look.

Oh, you got a locket.
Her name is Maxine.

She has asthma.
I worry about her so much.

She's cute.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Everybody got kids in here.

Nikki got kids.
Twin boys ain't with their mama.

Wet got two kids too.

But they got
taken away from her.

Girl, just get ready,
'cause Mother's Day,

it's tough in here.

<i>Mm-mmm. See, I'm getting my appeal,</i>
<i>and I'll be outta here.</i>

Oh really?
I'm getting outta here too.

<i>Oh yeah? When?</i>

In about... five years.

<i>Five years?</i>
<i>Damn.</i>

Yeah, five years.

Don't bullshit me.

Excuse me, Captain Dease?
Yeah.

Hi, I'm Michael Meadows.

Let me call you back.

That supposed to mean
something to me, son?

I'm the new correction officer.

I'm supposed to be starting
on Wednesday.

What are you
doing here now?

The warden said I should,
you know, just come by,

say hello, introduce myself.

Yeah, you the new
college boy, huh?

Yeah.
Hi, good to meet you.

Good to meet you too.

Can't you think of something
better to do than corrections, son?

I mean, well,
to be honest with you,

I need the money for tuition.
You need the money?

Yeah.
Everybody needs money.

I can understand that.
I'm not mad at you.

Don't worry about it.
We got this. We got this.

We got this.
We got this.

She says, <i>"We got this.</i>
<i>We got this."</i>

Pull up a chair.
Let's talk.

Okay.

Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

You know, I'm postgrad.
I'm a law major.

Criminal law.
I guess help people.

$5 say you don't got this.

<i>Now that's Aisha.</i>

<i>That's Dease's latest</i>
<i>piece of pussy.</i>

<i>Whatever she see,</i>
<i>she run and tell his ass.</i>

Aisha, you ain't
ass betting, are you? Huh?

Let Lil' Mama
hold the money. Lil' Mama?

Wait, wait-- hold up.
Hold up.

Why Lil' Mama gotta be
holding the money?

Why not?
'Cause she a Godfearing woman.

God bless and keep you, Wet.

Fuck am I, a church?
Here. Whatever.

My father and uh--

<i>Your father and Nelson</i>
<i>go way back?</i>

Yeah, they went
to school together.

I'm an only child.

My parents are only children too,
so it's just pretty much us.

I'll-- I'll trim it down.

Stop your jackin' and serve!

What?
<i>- Come on, now.</i>

All right, I'm gonna serve.

Fuck is wrong with you?!

Go for Dease.

Guard:
<i>There's a fight in the yard, sir.</i>

Lock 'em down.
I'm on my way.

Let's go, son.
Your orientation starts now.

You ain't bad, bitch.
We could go some more.

<i>- We could go some more.</i>
Stop it, God damn it! Stop it!

Who started this?!
<i>- She did!</i>

<i>You're a lying bitch!</i>
<i>She started it!</i>

<i>- Shut it up!</i>
Aisha hit her with the ball.

Shut the fuck up, Wet.
I'm not talking to you.

Shepard, who started this?

You better answer me,
God damn it.

That one. She did.
<i>- What?!</i>

All right, take these women
back to their units.

Come on! Move it!

Escort Miss Nance
back to her unit.

<i>All right, man, all right. Damn.</i>

You heard her.
I didn't do nothing.

Shut your ass.
That's for me to decide.

<i>All right, you heard him.</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

These inmates
are worse than animals.

They need discipline
and they need structure.

Especially that
little bitch Barnes.

I'm the only one in here
that can discipline her.

Gets on my fucking nerves.

You know,
it's kinda funny.

She's got this stupid
little crush on me.

You saw the way she was
looking at me, didn't you?

Yeah.
Did you see?

Yeah, yeah.

She gets upset if I don't
giver her enough attention.

You know how young girls are.
Yeah.

You're gonna do a great job.
I want you to remember this--

the warden may have hired you--

you got a problem, I'm the first
and the last person you talk to.

I run this motherfucking prison,
not Nelson.

Don't you ever forget that.
You got me?

Yeah.
Speaking of the devil,

here comes the warden now.
Mr. Warden.

Hey.
<i>- Mr. Nelson, how are you?</i>

Good to see you.

Good to see you.
All right. Same here.

How you doing?
All right. You've grown up, man.

Yeah. I just wanted to say
thank you once again.

I appreciate it.
Nothing to it.

Listen, if it gets a little rough
out here, make sure you let me know.

You can always work
in the office with me.

Okay.
You pick up your uniform?

No, actually I'm about
to go do that right now.

All right, good.
Good, go ahead.

Dease, you take care of him.
'Cause his people and my people

go way back.

I'm sure he's gonna
work out just fine.

All right.
Mr. Nelson, good to see you.

Take care.
Mr. Dease.

I got great news.
What's going on?

Wall Corp. People are coming.
Get your people up to speed.

They were just here.

I thought everything
checked out okay?

We did, but the Edgehill
facility didn't.

Wall Corp. Is thinking about pulling
their business from them.

And if that happens, it'll keep
the state from closing us down.

I see.
I like that.

That's cool.

Also, Wall Corp. Is thinking
about remodeling--

<i>Now most people don't know</i>
<i>that prison is big business.</i>

<i>Everybody was trying</i>
<i>to make a buck--</i>

<i>legal or otherwise.</i>

Nothing will change
but the size of our paychecks, baby.

I like the sound of that.
Yeah.

Hey.
Hey, baby.

How's it going?
Fine.

I thought I told you
not to call me that. Hmm?

I just wanted
to thank you

for checking Nikki
at the volleyball game.

You know, letting her know
who's important around here.

Come here and let me
talk to you.

Okay.

You miss me?
Of course I do.

I miss you too.

You stupid fucking bitch.

You ain't important.
Don't you ever think that you are.

You understand me?
Mmm.

Yes, Captain.
I can't hear you.

Yes, Captain.

Good, baby.

Now...

you got some information
for me?

No, I haven't heard nothing.

No?

No, no, no, no, no.

Not until
you bring me something.

<i>I'll come back</i>
<i>when I have something.</i>

Aren't you forgetting something,
baby girl?

<i>I don't know. Am I?</i>

You forgot to thank me.

Hold on a second.

Now you see me...

Now you don't.

This is Dease.
<i>- Yo, big dog, what's up, man?</i>

What's going on, Fred?
<i>- Nothing...</i>

Fuck him.

Ohh!

No!

Keep your motherfucking
mouth shut, ho!

Keep fucking with me.
Keep fucking with me, bitch.

Watch your motherfucking mouth--

Fucking bitch.

Gimme that.

Game over.

Fuck.
You lose, bitch.

Help! Help!

Fuck! I'm gonna get you, Nikki,
I swear!

Oh!

I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm sorry.

It's a coed locker room,
you know.

Yeah.
Not much you can do about it.

I forgot about that.

How you doing?
I'm doing pretty good.

<i>I guess you're doing fine.</i>

<i>Now Cervantes,</i>

<i>she was a cold-blooded</i>
<i>rules-and-regulations-type bitch.</i>

And I came out okay.

To tell you the truth, I don't think
the whole law enforcement thing

is, you know, for me.

I hope that's not an insult,
only because my family

is rooted in law enforcement.
Oh, I'm sorry.

We would try to, like, talk to her
about our problems sometimes,

but she was too busy trying
to earn stripes with the warden

hollering at all the new
male guards. 'Sup with that?

I didn't take it as a dis...
Okay, cool. Cool.

Maybe we can got to lunch
or something. You can explain.

Yeah.
Oh, wow, yeah.

That would be--
that would be dope.

I really wish I could.
I got study hall after this.

It's cool. Maybe--
maybe sometime in the future

we'll have a chance to talk
and I can change your mind

about law enforcement.

O-okay. All right, then.

Good.
All right.

Okay.
You take care.

You too, Cervantes.
All right now.

Why's she taking
so long on the phone?

Leave her alone.
She talking to her hairdresser.

Bitch ain't got but one friend.

Hurry the fuck on!
I got things to do!

And you got 10 years to do it.

Can you say "appeal"?

Can I say, "In 10 years
your ass gonna be up in here"?

Now you gonna be
up in here.

I'm a convict. What you want?
Frances Shepard?

The warden needs to see you.

Oh, come on.
I got to use the phone.

He said that we need
to leave right away.

<i>You know, Shepard,</i>

<i>you'd get along much better if you'd</i>
<i>learn to speak up in here.</i>

Who knows, you might become
a trustee one day.

Captain.
How are you, sir?

Shepard?

What happened to your face?

Nothing.
Just a few questions.

Did you see who stabbed
Aisha Nance?

No, sir, I didn't.

But you were in the area
where the stabbing occurred.

Yes, sir, I admit
I saw Aisha.

But it was after I came out
of the bathroom.

Did you hear anything?
No, sir.

Do you have someplace to be?

I don't want to miss
my phone time.

All right, you can go.

That's all. Thank you.
Thank you.

Nobody's talking.
We're wasting time.

She knows
what happened, sir.

Like me to lock
the unit down, sir?

Damn it, Dease, no,
we can't lock the unit down.

We got to keep everybody working.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

I don't want to rush you. Try to
make this as quick as you can.

<i>How's Michael?</i>
<i>How's he doing?</i>

He's doing okay, sir.

I mean, I prefer a military
trained person.

They're more dependable.

College boys are a little
too soft for me.

I went to college, Dease.

Are you trying to say
I'm too soft?

No, sir.

No, sir.

Keep sharp, baby.

<i>How's mommy's big girl?</i>

<i>Mommy, I want to see you, Mommy.</i>

I want to see you, too.

Are you doing what Auntie Kim
tells you to?

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Why can't I see you?</i>

<i>Mommy, I want to see you.</i>

<i>This is the telephone observer.</i>
<i>Your call time has expired.</i>

<i>- Mommy--</i>
Baby, it was--

You all right, Ms. Shepard?

No.

Your daughter's all right?
Everything okay with your daughter?

No.

I hope I didn't get you
in trouble.

No, no.
Thanks.

It's okay.

We should probably just go.

<i>Okay, any spade that you</i>
<i>have can cut through a suit.</i>

<i>And the higher the spade,</i>
<i>the better the cut.</i>

You think Frances
said something to Nelson?

They ain't hauling me off
to solitary.

And we ain't on lockdown,
are we?

No, she ain't say nothing.
She better not.

Frances ain't even
that kind of person.

Lil' Mama, ain't you got some
scripture reading or something?

I like Rodney Dangerfield myself.

He's got all those fat jokes.

"How can you tell when your--

when your wife gets too fat?"

I don't know.

"When she sits on your face
and you can't hear the stereo."

Hey, Nikki!

Wake up, baby.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

I know you stabbed Aisha, Nikki.
But if you be sweet to me...

<i>- I'm gonna be sweet to you.</i>
<i>- No! Leave me alone!</i>

<i>All right, all right,</i>
<i>you little bitch!</i>

<i>Come here, you little bitch!</i>
<i>I'm gonna beat...</i>

Nikki's beating wasn't
about no Aisha.

It was about Dease and Nikki.

They say Dease
was crazy about her.

But she hated
that nigga's guts.

So he would do stuff like
single her and her group out

and act like he was making
examples out of them.

Yeah, right.
Everybody knew what was up.

Ain't no secrets in jail.

<i># There were no mirrors</i>
<i>in my nana's house #</i>

<i># No mirrors in my nana's house #</i>

<i># There were no mirrors</i>
<i>in my nana's house #</i>

<i># No mirrors in my nana's house #</i>

<i># And the beauty that I saw</i>
<i>in everything #</i>

<i># The beauty in everything, yeah #</i>

<i># Was in her eyes #</i>

<i># Ohh, was in her eyes #</i>

<i># I'm telling you, there were</i>
<i>no mirrors in my nana's house. #</i>

<i>You see me with a fat lady,</i>
<i>I'm holding her for the police.</i>

What's up, Captain?
What's going on, Banks?

I'll see y'all later.

My friend's wife was so fat,
you tell her to haul ass

she got to make two trips.

What you got, Banks?

Got something good for me?

Oh my goodness, homemade
macaroni and cheese.

Let me get a little shot
of that, buddy.

Mm-hmm.
Woo, Lordy.

Don't you ever get tired
of grubbing off me?

No, sir.
Quit your bitchin' about it, Banks.

You got seven mouths to feed.
One more ain't gonna hurt you none.

No, my wife's
pregnant again.

Get the fuck outta here.

Don't you white boys
believe in birth control?

College boy,
what's going on?

How you doing?
I brought some drinks and stuff.

Good, put 'em right over there.

Uh, just to give you
a heads up,

the toilets and stuff on block four,
they're still stopped up.

It's starting to smell
pretty bad up there.

That's good. Might offset the smell
of some of them stink-ass bitches.

Everything's broke. Won't be long
before the state closes us down.

I'm already looking
for a job.

Don't be no fool.
You know what I know,

you'll keep your ass
right here.

If it's about Wall Corp.,
I'm still looking for a job.

I'm gonna tell you
what the problem is.

It's these soft young boys
coming in here--

got personal contacts.
Taking everybody's jobs.

Ain't that right, Michael?
You ain't in the union?

<i>I just told you he was</i>
<i>a college boy.</i>

Him and Nelson
go way back.

Ain't that right, Michael?

Everybody in this shithole
will be untrained.

Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna look out for our crew.

You just try to make
that meeting next Friday.

I'll be there
'cause I got mouths to feed.

I <i>need</i> my job.
I feel ya. I need the job too.

That's why I'm here. I ain't got
no kids or nothing like that.

I'm in school, I got tuition to pay.
I got loans, you know?

I ain't trying
to take nobody's job.

I'm just trying to get a dollar
like everybody else.

To tell you the truth, I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

What did you expect, "Oz"?

No, no, I didn't
expect "Oz." No.

But you know,
it's rough sometimes, man.

It gets rough, the way the women
get treated sometimes.

"Way these women get treated"?
What the fuck are you talking about?

Nothing, I'm just--
What are you talking about?!

These women are thieves,
murders, drug addicts--

they don't have respect
for a goddamn thing!

The only remedy is locking them up
and throwing away the key.

If by chance they do
get out of here,

they gonna pray on their knees
never to get back in here again!

Jesus Christ. What fucking boat
did you jump off of?

I got to get back
to work.

I'll see you later, Banks.
Let me tell you something else--

you're working a double shift
next week.

You got me?

Might help you earn some
of that extra money you need...

college boy.

I didn't know I was
in the goddamn army.

17 years in this place.
Yeah?

If it's doing that to him, he needs
to think about a career change.

<i>Now Michael</i>
<i>may have been in college,</i>

<i>but his real education came when</i>
<i>he started working in the prison.</i>

<i>He thought it was all</i>
<i>about rehabilitation.</i>

<i>When Michael got going</i>
<i>with his research,</i>

<i>he uncovered a lot of shit.</i>

<i>Found out that we were high-priced</i>
<i>stock down on Wall Street.</i>

<i>Everybody was making money</i>
<i>off our asses.</i>

<i>We were sewing ski coats</i>
<i>for $1.50 a day</i>

<i>that some woman in France would be</i>
<i>paying like $1000 for next month.</i>

<i>Lil' Mama, what's wrong?</i>

Oh, Frances, the baby!
I'm right here.

<i>Oh shit.</i>

<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Don't try to get up.</i>

Lay like that.
It's okay.

<i>No.</i>

<i>Lil' Mama's sick!</i>
<i>Somebody get a doctor!</i>

What's going on?
Guard!

We have a right
to see a doctor!

Guard, emergency!

We need help!
Where's the guard?

My God!

Don't let nothing
happen to her.

Lil' Mama, just breathe.
Relax. It's going to be okay.

Thank God.
<i>- How's she doing?</i>

Lil' Mama,
you have to rest.

<i>Frances, is she bleeding?</i>

No blood...
thank God.

<i>Hey, "Saditty."</i>

Lil' Mama says
you killed your old man.

I didn't mean to.

I just wanted to get him
off me,

<i>stop all the hitting</i>
<i>and the beating.</i>

So you're innocent.

I think so.

That shit is crazy.
He's beating your ass

and you're supposed to just
lay there and take it

and not defend yourself?

Sounds like you should've
been my lawyer.

No, I should've been
your lawyer.

Matter of fact,
I'd've been a great lawyer.

What you in here for, Wet?
Something stupid.

Shot a track star
in the calf.

With a.38 no less,
and a dozen people watching.

Bet she won't be fucking with
nobody else's man, right, Wet?

No, she won't. She won't be running
any more races, either.

I feel bad about that.

Stupid shit, you know?

Yeah, I know.

<i>I'm tired.</i>

<i>Hourly quotas</i>
<i>standard 20 pieces on schedule.</i>

<i>Pick up four more pieces.</i>

How come you ain't tell
nobody you were a nurse?

'Cause didn't nobody
ask me.

Thanks for helping
with Lil' Mama last night.

That was nice of you.

You didn't have to do nothing,
and you did.

You're all right with me,
"Saditty."

Nikki.
What?

My name is Frances.

Call me that.

All right, <i>Frances.</i>

Might make you my little sister
or something up in here.

<i>All we had</i>
<i>was each other</i>

<i>and sometimes a little support</i>
<i>from the outside.</i>

<i>Like one visiting day,</i>
<i>when Nikki's mama</i>

<i>was bringing the babies</i>
<i>that she had in jail.</i>

<i>You know that motherfucker Dease</i>
<i>wouldn't even let Nikki hold 'em</i>

<i>before he gave her</i>
<i>to her mother?</i>

<i>Frances was excited</i>
<i>'cause she was expecting</i>

<i>good news from her lawyer</i>
<i>about the appeal.</i>

<i>Everybody was feeling good</i>
<i>that day.</i>

You look so pretty.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

Where you going?

Her mama is coming
to bring her babies!

Lil' Mama, you can't hold piss.
I'm sorry.

I didn't want nobody
to know until now.

You better take pictures.
You look beautiful.

I'm happy for you.

Hey, hey, I did a good job.
Yeah, you did.

Well, Ms. Barnes.

Well, well, well.
Ms. Barnes, Ms. Barnes.

Don't she look pretty?

Like going to the prom
or something.

<i>Very nice.</i>

Ms. Shepard,
you have a visitor.

See you later, Frances.
See you soon, guys.

<i>I will be back for you,</i>
<i>Ms. Barnes.</i>

Okay.

Okay, so in the meantime,
I got smokes.

<i>But like they say,</i>
<i>"Shit happens."</i>

<i>Nikki's mama never came,</i>
<i>and Frances' appeal was denied.</i>

Ms. Shepard, your transfer
was denied.

Guess you're gonna
be with us a little longer.

Come on, ladies.
Eat up! Eat up!

Come on, eat up!

<i>Man, they start working us</i>
<i>longer and longer.</i>

<i>Sometimes we went to bed</i>
<i>without dinner.</i>

<i>After all that</i>
<i>and Nikki's beating too,</i>

<i>man, Wet said</i>
<i>she had enough.</i>

<i>She said we had to do</i>
<i>something else</i>

<i>instead of going out to work</i>
<i>like some docile field niggas.</i>

<i>It was time for her to give</i>
<i>our petitions to the warden.</i>

Frances,
I got this petition

that I'm trying
to get people to sign.

<i>Man, things got even worse.</i>
<i>The warden laughed in Wet's face</i>

<i>and he threw the petitions</i>
<i>in the garbage.</i>

<i>Plus he wrote her up</i>
<i>and added time to her sentence.</i>

<i>And then that fucking</i>
<i>troublemaking bitch Aisha,</i>

<i>she came back from the hospital</i>
<i>and everybody was in a funk again.</i>

How was it up in the big
federal hospital?

Did they sew up
your hole too?

Yeah, but your mama stretched it
back out with her tongue.

On the yard, bitch. On the yard.
Inmates, you just lost chow time.

I ain't no inmate, bitch.

I'm a convict.

Wet took the warden's
rejection pretty bad.

So us girls decided to hook her up
with a little contraband.

We had a nice little party.

Let's go.

You know what I want to do
when I get out?

I want to get some sleep.

<i>Word up.</i>

I am so tired of "lights out,"

"chow down."

I'm tired
of being programmed.

Yeah.
I want me some keys.

Open up the doors
and come and go as I please.

<i>- I know what you mean.</i>
I feel you, girl.

Here's to them--
here's to our babies

and survival.

Survival.
I heard that.

He's coming.
Oh shit, it's Dease.

In the pantry. In the pantry.

Quiet. Quiet.
Go, go, go.

I'm going as fast as I can.
Busted by him.

<i>- Hurry, hurry.</i>
Okay!

What's Dease doing back here?

Something he ain't got
no business doing.

What is he doing behind the stove?

<i>Like I said, something he ain't</i>
<i>got no business doing.</i>

<i>- Long night, Meadows?</i>

Um, yeah.

I was...

<i>I was studying last night.</i>

College boy's
got a hard life.

I didn't know you cared, Banks.
I don't.

<i>- What was that?</i>

Center, this is Cervantes.
What the hell was that?

<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Something blew up in the kitchen.</i>

Okay, roger that. Come on.
<i>- Attention!</i>

Dease's friend got the contracts
to rebuild the kitchen.

But he blamed the inmates,
as usual.

He tried to say somebody
was negligent,

and that he wanted to find out
who it was to make them pay.

Like he wasn't the one
fucking up all the time.

And Nelson? Nelson shut
the whole prison down.

No visits, no phone calls,
no nothing after that.

Shut down.

Hey, my man.
Hey.

Good to see you.
All right.

Hey, listen, I'm playing golf with
the Wall Corp. People on Saturday.

I wanted to include you,
but we already got a foursome.

Maybe next time, okay?

Well, thanks for thinking
about me.

No problem.
I'm not that big on golf anyway.

Yeah, but you do play some games,
don't you, Dease?

Sir?

I'm talking about that little
explosion in the kitchen.

Any truth to that?

No, sir.

I mean, who said that?

It doesn't matter who said it.
The problem is it got back to me.

<i>Guess what? I'm hip to that scam</i>
<i>about your boys</i>

<i>rebuilding the damage</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

Now listen, your job is to take care
of everything on the plan.

But when people
come to my office

and tell me about a whole bunch
of stuff I don't give a damn about,

then that means you're
not doing your job.

I'm doing my job.
No, you're <i>not</i> doing your job.

Shante Wright came to me

circulating a petition
you didn't even know about.

<i>- Wet's petitions are bullshit.</i>
What's that, Dease?

Are the inmates in control now?
No, sir.

Let me get something straight.

I run this fucking prison,
not you!

Yes, sir.

I want all your sideline
operations to stop.

If I get wind that you're still
doing your dirty business,

I'm gonna put you right
back where I found you--

in the Florida swamps
walking a guard tower...

with the mosquitoes
buzzing all around your ass.

<i>- Comprende?</i>
Yes, sir.

"The beauty of life
is knowing you are loved.

As time passes, knowledge
and understanding of who you are

<i>cause seeds of doubt</i>
<i>to disappear..."</i>

Psst, psst, psst.

Shut up a minute.
Move out of the way.

Shakedown. Yo, shakedown.
Shakedown.

<i>What are you looking for?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

This is what I'm looking for.
Take your hands off my shit!

Guard:
Where are you going?

You're gonna pay
for that, bitch!

<i>- Get your hands off her!</i>
What did you do to her?!

Let's see how much writing
you do up in the hole.

Fuck you!

Take her to the hole now!
Now!

Is there a law against
reading and writing?

Hold it down, Wet.

God is gonna keep you, Wet.
Back up. Let's go.

Please keep her.
Get your asses back in your cells.

Please don't let them hit her.

God, please guard Wet.

Harvey, I don't give a goddamn
about that. Just get it done.

Jesus Christ.

Son of a bitch.

Well, well, well.

You must be my new girl.

Yes, sir.
I'm replacing Sabrina.

Ooh.

And what's your name,
young lady?

Rose.
Rose.

That's a very pretty name.

Thanks.

You know, my grandmama's
name was Rose.

I sure do like
the way you clean, Rose.

Now, you...

you missed a spot
right up there, Rose.

A piece of cobweb that's hanging
down right there. You see that?

I like everything in here
to be real spotless.

Why don't you take
that chair

and get that piece
of cobweb up there, Rose.

Mm-mmm. I sure do
like the way you clean, Rose.

Yeah, you and I
are gonna work out just fine--

Can I go now, sir?

I'm not stopping you.

<i>When Lil' Mama</i>
<i>told us what Dease tried to do,</i>

<i>and Wet came back from the hole</i>
<i>with that nasty scar on her face--</i>

<i>aw man, we didn't care</i>
<i>what was gonna happen to us.</i>

<i>We just knew</i>
<i>we had to fight back.</i>

<i>All we needed</i>
<i>was an opportunity.</i>

<i>Mike told us Wall Corp.</i>
<i>Was coming,</i>

<i>so we started getting</i>
<i>our shit tight.</i>

Something to motivate you.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

<i># Put your money #</i>

<i>- # Money where the funk is... #</i>
All right.

Inmate:
<i>Here, come on, y'all.</i>

<i># Put your money #</i>

<i># Money where the funk is... #</i>

<i>In a few days</i>
<i>they got the petition signed</i>

<i>and people organized it</i>
<i>right under Dease's nose, man.</i>

<i># They're talkin' 'bout</i>
<i>the things you do #</i>

<i># Seem to try to impress</i>
<i>the crowd #</i>

<i># But all you're doing</i>
<i>is talking loud... #</i>

So what'd they say?
Wall Corp. Changed the date on us.

To when?
Next Thursday.

<i>Everything was going fine</i>
<i>till Lil' Mama came work one day</i>

and found out that Wall Corp.
Had changed the date.

They flipped the scrip on us,
so we had to flip it back on them.

<i># Put your money,</i>
<i>money where the funk is #</i>

<i># Put your money #</i>

<i># Money where the funk is... #</i>

<i>Yo, we used Kyce</i>
<i>to pass the word,</i>

<i>but we couldn't make</i>
<i>no fuck ups,</i>

<i>'cause we would've blew it</i>
<i>before we even got started.</i>

<i># Your money #</i>

<i># Put your money #</i>

<i># Money where the funk is. #</i>

I been praying on this all night.
It's gonna be all right.

Did you talk to D?
I ain't got nothing to do with it.

Don't depend on me,
don't ask me shit.

Hey, look, you read
the demands,

I'll hand it to them.
Why? You the leader.

As soon as I stand,
they're going to suspect

that some shit's
about to go down.

Then I'll do it.
Okay.

I'll stand right behind you.
Okay?

Captain Dease? Miller.
Glad to meet you.

I've been waiting for you.
My associate Owen.

<i>- Miller! You made it.</i>
Nelson! My man, what's going on?

Everything's going fine.
That hole in one on the 17th?

It was doggone impressive
on Saturday.

Dease, you should've been there!
Sorry, I couldn't make it.

In all seriousness, our inmates
love the work they do.

They leave here
with valuable skills,

and you have a product
you can market around the world.

The labor pool here
is more cost effective.

I'll let you in
on a little secret--

the workers can't quit here.

It's just that Mr. Dease and I

are looking forward to working
with you more closely.

We really are. We really are.
Mr. Dease is quite the bulldog.

Every shop needs one.
-

You're gonna be very impressed
with what we've set up here.

We've managed to put double the--

<i>I'm very impressed.</i>

<i>The last two quarters</i>
<i>have been outstanding.</i>

<i>I wish we had this kind of spirit</i>
<i>at all our facilities.</i>

<i>And the next two quarters</i>
<i>are going to be even better.</i>

But let me show you around.

These women are making
the linings for your ski jackets.

They're very well trained
and we see to that.

We work with the team system.

<i>That group attaches the linings</i>
<i>to the shell of the jacket</i>

<i>and then the zippers</i>
<i>are sewn in.</i>

Definitely, and we also have--
what the...?

This is a peaceful
work stoppage.

We stand in solidarity...
<i>- Shut up, sit down!</i>

...with all reform movements,
demanding fair treatment...

<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.</i>
Dease, what's going on?

...better work conditions,
better heat...

<i>- Shepard, sit down!</i>
An end to the vicious beatings

and the sexual abuse
we face every day.

Work, God damn it!
Get back to work!

Take our petitions

and let everybody know what goes on
behind these walls.

<i>Dease, what's going on?</i>
<i>Huh? Little joke?</i>

All of these women
stand behind these demands.

Frankly, we've been having a little
problem with these two women.

As you can see,
nobody else is standing.

I stand behind her too.
<i>- Sabrina!</i>

<i>I hope you bitches know</i>
<i>what you're doing!</i>

I stand behind her.
<i>- Back to work!</i>

I stand behind her.
I stand behind her.

I stand behind her.

Yeah.
<i>- Your ass is gonna pay for this.</i>

<i>Your black asses</i>
<i>are gonna pay for this.</i>

<i>Get back to work, I say!</i>
<i>God damn it!</i>

<i>- I'm up here too.</i>
<i>- I'm behind you.</i>

Please... take this.

Go on, take it!
Look, go back to work.

Fuck that shit! Fuck you!

Why'd you do that?

Take her to the hole!
The fucking bitch!

Get back to work!

Get back
to work!

Get back to work!

How long have we been in?

Three... four days.

Yeah, well,
you better get used to it.

'Cause we're gonna
be in here for a while.

One...

<i>two...</i>

31...

Three...
Four...

Eight.

Nine.

<i>35. Come on.</i>
<i>Come on, Nikki, you can do this.</i>

<i>- Come on.</i>
-

We been in this motherfucker
for six days!

Ain't nobody been in here
for six days!

Fuck this shit, man.
Fuck this shit!

Come on, Nikki,
you can do this!

<i>Stay focused.</i>
<i>Come on, let's do it!</i>

What makes you so sure
we gonna make it?

'Cause I got a little girl and she's
waiting on me to come home.

What's her name?
Maxine.

Oh, Maxine.

No. Maxine!

Baby?
Where are you, baby?

Oh my God.
No, wait.

Frances?

Oh good.
Frances.

Her name is Maxine.

Her name
is Maxine.

<i>Her name is Maxine.</i>

<i>My baby's name</i>
<i>is Maxine.</i>

<i>So, what you in for?</i>

Armed robbery.

For the reason women are always
doing some old dumb shit--

for a nigga.

Mmm.

But what a nigga
he was.

<i>His name was Smalls.</i>

<i>He swore he was a baller,</i>

but he wasn't nothing
but a seven-gram nigga.

Then he gets this idea
to rob this old bullshit dealer.

Now I know he was too stupid
to pull it off without me.

We were gonna be
Bonnie and Clyde.

Get some of that ice, some of that
fly shit we see up in the videos.

Only Smalls wasn't
no Clyde.

Fool went
and got hisself killed.

<i>And I ended up</i>
<i>back in here...</i>

again.

<i>Had to make it on my own.</i>
<i>I never wanted to hurt nobody.</i>

I've always tried
to follow the rules.

I never followed no rules,

and we end up
in the same place.

Ain't that some shit?

<i>Then I met Greg.</i>

<i>I loved him so much.</i>

Wonder what they're
doing back home?

I ain't never been high.

How does it feel?

Hope that motherfucker Dease
gets what he has coming to him...

and I'm there
to see it.

Don't run from me, Nikki.

It's time to get high.

Got something for you.

You think about it, Nikki.

You gonna be in here
a long, long time.

<i>And this is gonna help</i>
<i>the time pass faster.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Take a little trip.</i>

<i>What's going on in there?</i>

I'm gonna leave this
right here for you.

<i>Come on, Nikki.</i>

<i>- Nikki?</i>
<i>- Take a little hit.</i>

<i>- Nikki?</i>
<i>- You'll give in.</i>

You know you're
not that strong.

No, Nikki, listen to me!

Listen to me. Stay focused.
Repeat after me.

<i>Five times two.</i>
<i>Five times two's 10.</i>

<i>It's 10.</i>
<i>Five times three is 15.</i>

<i>Repeat after me.</i>
<i>Stay focused.</i>

<i># Angel dust, angel dust... #</i>

Five times four...

is 20.

...times five is 25.

Five times six is-- is 30.

<i>I can't hear you!</i>

Five times seven...
<i>- Is what?</i>

<i>- is 35.</i>
Yeah.

Five times eight...
<i>- Yeah?</i>

is 40.
<i>- Very good.</i>

<i>You're stronger than that.</i>
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

All right, Barnes, it's time.

Don't just sit there.

Come on.

Let's go, Shepard.

Come on.

Go on, get up.

Stand your ass
over there.

Nikki and Frances didn't think
the strike meant anything.

But they were wrong.

It meant something to me.
Before that day,

I had never stood up
for nothing in my life.

But I stood up that day,
and I been standing up ever since.

The captain's got
a little surprise for you.

You're gonna be
peeling this wall.

By myself?
That's what I said.

<i>What does the blind man</i>
<i>say when he pass the fish store?</i>

Good morning, ladies.

Didn't you say it was this wall?

This one?

Banks just told me
he told you to peel this wall.

No, no, he said to peel--
I did not.

Are you telling me you don't
know the authorized areas?

<i>- No, I'm not saying that.</i>
What exactly are you saying?

He said peel this wall--
Banks said to peel this wall.

No, Banks said this wall.
Did you say peel this one?

You're lying.
He said to peel this wall.

Banks said to peel this wall!
Banks said peel this wall!

I fucking heard what Banks said!
Take her back to the hole.

No, no!
Take her back to the hole!

Please, please, no!
Take her black ass to the hole!

No, no, I'll do anything you say!
Don't, please!

Please, whatever you say,
Captain.

Just-- no, no.
Tell me you'll be a good bitch.

I'll be good.
I pro-- I promise.

Tell me you're gonna be
a good bitch.

Tell me you're
gonna be a good bitch.

Say it!

Say it! "I'm gonna be a good bitch,
Captain Dease."

Say it!

I'll be a good bitch,
Captain Dease.

Leave her ass.

I ain't through with you.

<i>That bitch.</i>

Thank you.
Shepard, you got 15.

Hey.

You don't look so good, Sis.

It's called a prison tan.

There ain't no beaches.
Where's the baby?

I tried to come see you, but--

but they said everybody
was on lockdown.

And I was in solitary.

Oh, come on.
Hey, hey.

Stop crying.
Don't cry.

Come on, it's been rough,
but I'm out now.

I'm here.

Is the baby
in the car?

Don't tell me they wouldn't
let you bring her in?

No.

I swear, I told Walter--

I told Walter to stay away
from those gangs.

Kim, where's the baby?
There was a fight.

You're talking in circles.
<i>- Walter didn't tell me nothing.</i>

The bullet--
What bullet?

It got Maxine!

She died two weeks ago!
No, no, no!

I tried to call you!

No! No!

Don't tell me!
You're lying!

<i>No! No!</i>

No!

<i>No!</i>

<i>You're lying 'bout Maxine!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i># Strange things happen</i>
<i>every day #</i>

<i># Oh, strange things</i>
<i>happen every day #</i>

<i># Throwin' it down</i>
<i>on a horse named Jimmy... #</i>

What'd you hear?

They got her
on suicide watch.

Motherfuckers.

You speak
to your old man?

Yeah, the lawyer said--

all we need to do
is get hard proof.

And we gonna find a way
to get it, too.

<i># Skinny be locked</i>
<i>in the jaybird jail, yeah #</i>

<i># He trained, laughing</i>

You know, Frances,
despite what you might think,

I am really sorry about
what happened to your daughter.

Come on.

<i># Cinderella dressed in yellow #</i>

<i># Went upstairs</i>
<i>to kiss a fella #</i>

<i># Made a mistake</i>
<i>and kissed a snake #</i>

<i># How many chocolates</i>

What this bitch want?

I don't know.

It's cool, Nik.

So how y'all gonna get him?

Who you talking about, Aisha?

Nikki, you know who
I'm talking about.

Dease. I know you're all
over here planning something.

<i>Huh?</i>

We thought Dease
was your "loverman."

Oh my God.
Damn. What happened?

Something that ain't
never gonna happen again.

I want that motherfucker so bad
I could taste that shit.

Even if we was thinking
about doing something,

which we wasn't,

what makes you think we would
trust your rathole ass?

That's a fair question.

I swear on the life
of my little shorty

that if I don't get revenge
on that black motherfucker

y'all could--

y'all could do me.

And we will do you, Aisha.

I know y'all are not through
with Dease.

I know y'all got a plan
or something.

But I want revenge
on that black motherfucker.

Never know. Maybe we could
do a little business.

Yeah, we'll call you on that.
We'll call you.

He fucked her up.

They finally came up
with a plan.

But they needed somebody's
help from the inside.

<i>So they asked Michael.</i>

Excuse me.
Could I talk to you for a minute?

<i>Dease's days were numbered because</i>
<i>they went to work on his ass.</i>

Ahem.

Captain?

Come here.

What are you doing here?

I thought you were
mad at me.

I missed you, lover.

Rose,

that's enough
cleaning for today.

You can go.

I'll be right back.

Don't you go anywhere.

You look good.
So you're not mad at me, huh?

Captain, sir, I forgot my Bible.
Well, just get it and go, Rose.

You look good today.

Hurry up, Rose!

Jesus.
Thank you, sir.

Come here.

Show me you miss me.
Stop, sir.

What are you talking about?
Stop, sir.

Don't play with me.
What did I do?!

I didn't do anything.
You changing up on me, girl?

Please, I didn't do anything.
Aah! No!

I didn't do anything. Please.
Shut up. Shut up.

Please. Please don't!
Why are you doing this?

Shit.

Oh God.

Oh God.

Oh, shit.

May I have a towel...

sir?

Of course, baby.

Oh shit.

<i>Oh shit.</i>

Bastard.

Oh shit.

Get the fuck up outta here.

The plan was Lil' Mama
was gonna get the tape to Michael.

Ahh! No!

Michael was gonna get
the tape to Wet's boyfriend.

Wet's boyfriend was gonna get
the tape to somebody

who had a hook up
with the governor.

So we was trying to be straight.
Shut up!

Lil' Mama came back to work
to get the tape

with her Bible case empty.

<i>But the damn door was locked,</i>
<i>and Dease took off early.</i>

<i>Now she gotta come back tomorrow</i>
<i>and try the shit again.</i>

Damn broom.
Dirty-ass prison.

<i>Ain't you done enough</i>
<i>cleaning for today, Rose?</i>

<i>You're a hardworking lady.</i>

You been cleaning
all morning.

You ought to be tired
by now.

I know how you like it, sir.

That's a real sweet thing
to say, Rose.

<i>Real sweet.</i>

<i>You know, I been noticing</i>
<i>how pretty you are, Rose.</i>

Who the fuck is Dease?

I love your hair.

Thank you.

Yeah, this is Dease.

<i>Captain Dease, we're waiting</i>
<i>for you to start the meeting.</i>

Cervantes, can't you
handle the meeting?

<i>But we can't vote</i>
<i>until you--</i>

I can't be there right now.
Rose!

This nigga wants to be
the last one up in here.

Where the fuck is he at?

You're not trying to leave me,
are you, Rose?

Stop it, sir. Please!

Come on, Rose. I know you like
the way it feels, don't you?

No, I don't.
It's a sin!

Like what you did
to your father, Rose?

He wasn't my father.

Stepfather.
Lover.

Father of your unborn child.

Don't make
no fucking difference.

You're no fucking virgin, Rose.
Are you?

Are you? Are you, Rose?!

Stop it!
You ain't a fucking virgin.

Stop it! Stop it!
I knew you wasn't a virgin.

You don't give this shit to me,
I'm gonna take it.

No!
I'm gonna take it, Rose!

No!
Shut the fuck up.

Lean your ass over here.

<i>Please don't do this.</i>
<i>Please don't do this!</i>

<i>"The Lord is</i>
<i>my light and my salvation;</i>

<i>whom shall I fear? The Lord</i>
<i>is the strength of my life;</i>

<i>whom shall I be afraid?"</i>

Damn, where are you,
Lil' Mama?

What happened?!

He never showed up.
Damn, I gotta go look for her.

Dease was supposed
to be at that meeting.

Something's up.

Oh.
Oh my God!

What happened to you?
Frances, the baby!

Oh shit! Help me get her up.
Help me get her up.

All right.
Oh my God, she's bleeding.

Oh my God!
Get her to the infirmary now!

You've gotta--
Ow!

No, keep walking.
Get her back, back.

Back it up.
Swing it around.

What's wrong with her?

She's having a miscarriage.
No!

The baby?
I can't do anything for the child.

I got to try to save her
if I can.

Hold on, Lil' Mama.
Hold on.

It's okay. It's okay.
<i>- No!</i>

What happened?
We're here for you.

I was raped
by the captain.

I was raped!
You were raped?

Oh my God.

Hold her down!

<i>- Keep her still.</i>

<i>- We need you to do this.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

<i>- I can't get a pulse.</i>
<i>- I'm a nurse.</i>

She's having a cardiac arrest.

<i>Get the defibrillator.</i>

Here.
Hold on, Lil' Mama.

Hold on.
Please, Lil' Mama, hold on!

Let her go. Let her go.
Let her go, Nikki!

Let her go!

<i>Clear!</i>

Again.
Oh no, no, no.

Please hold on.
Breathe!

Breathe, baby!
Breathe, baby!

She's not moving.

Turn the machine off.
What?

She's gone.
No!

No, Lil' Mama, hold on, girl!

Do it now!
I think you girls should go now.

Guard, get them out of here.
Oh God.

I'm so sorry. No! No, Mama, no!
<i>- She's dead!</i>

<i>- He's not helping us!</i>
<i>- Oh fuck!</i>

Guard,
get them out of here!

I'm gonna call Captain Dease.
What the fuck are you doing?

We need a guard in here!
Let me go!

<i>- Off the phone, God damn it!</i>
<i>- Stop it!</i>

Snatch the phone, Nikki!
Snatch the phone!

<i># Went on a date with her,</i>
<i>then he raped her #</i>

<i># What?</i>
<i>The nigga violated her? #</i>

<i>- # Where the hell he at? #</i>
<i>- # Look, I ain't even sure #</i>

<i># But I'm about to pick you up,</i>
<i>meet me at the corner store... #</i>

No!

Michael, I got to cuff you.
Come on.

<i># Breathing underground,</i>
<i>then I'll cut off his dick #</i>

<i># Put a hole in his tongue,</i>
<i>then I won't be done... #</i>

We ain't going no-fuckin'-where!
It's on!

We ain't going
no-fuckin'-where!

Cervantes, listen carefully.

<i>Isolate the infirmary</i>
<i>from the cellblock.</i>

Copy that. Come on, guys.
Frances, what are y'all doing?

Doing what we gotta do.

Your black ass is going
back to the hole.

If you knew what I knew,
you'd lay down and die right now.

You first, motherfucker.

<i># Now we can't talk,</i>
<i>mumbling #</i>

<i># When it's over, yo,</i>
<i>we gonna walk #</i>

<i># Stumbling,</i>
<i>I thought Kim was small #</i>

<i># And I keep it from the start,</i>
<i>and yo, he got heart #</i>

<i># So y'all can't wait</i>
<i>till it get dark... #</i>

<i>Down here.</i>

Burn in hell!
Mother-- fuck you!

<i>Hey, Doc,</i>
<i>are you okay?!</i>

Whoever you are, stop there.
<i>- Get his handcuffs.</i>

We got hostages.
<i>- Who's going to the hole now?</i>

You come around that corner,
we shoot the hostages.

<i>Emergency lockdown.</i>
<i>I repeat, emergency lockdown.</i>

Are they contained
in the infirmary?

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

They're armed.

I couldn't even get
my men up the main stairway.

Isn't there another way in?

Up the fire escape
and through the main courtyard.

<i>But they'll see us coming.</i>

<i>Look, sir...</i>

we can go in hard and fast,

but I really think we need
to let the governor know.

Nobody's going to call the governor.
We'll handle this ourselves.

Shit.

We can handle this in house,
deal with the fallout afterwards.

I don't think that's a good idea--
Shut up!

All right.

All right, they only have
in-house phones, right?

Yes, sir.
All right, we wait for their call.

I want your men ready,
locked and cocked, okay?

They got Dease tied up
real good.

Die, you motherfucker.

But they let Michael go, 'cause they
didn't have no beef with him.

Guess he was just a good guy
caught up in a bad situation.

<i>Who ever heard of women</i>
<i>taking over a prison?</i>

What we gonna do?

We gotta make our demands.

We got to do what real
revolutionaries do

to get attention.

Fuckin' bitches.

Do what I'd do-- you'd give
yourselves up... and let me go,

before you get
your fucking heads blown off.

You call us bitches again...
Nikki! Nikki!

...you the one who's gonna
get his fucking head blown off!

Nikki!
No! Fuck me!

I got the bitch for you,
motherfucker!

Stop! We gotta think.

You bitches can't think--
you're three grades too short.

Wet!
What's that, you fucking shit?!

Look, they gotta know that Dease
killed Lil' Mama and Doc.

They ain't gonna believe that shit.
You know what?

Don't tell Nelson nothing.

Go over his head
and talk to the governor.

Nikki...

you're onto some shit.

You know what? And I know exactly
what you should say, Sister Frances.

Warden Nelson.
This is Frances Shepard,

from the Women's
Reform Committee.

Cut the bullshit, Shepard.

Why don't you give
yourself up?

Do you think this is
some kind of political action?

Everything is political.

<i>You got one hour to get</i>
<i>the governor on the line.</i>

I have no power to do that.
Let me speak to Captain Dease.

One hour.

Damn it!

You look stressed, my nigga.

Yeah.
You got a light?

Damn. You gonna help?

I'm gonna help.
All right, then I got a light.

Is this the governor?

I gotta know if the hostages
are all right.

Put somebody on the phone.
Anybody.

You just got
to take my word for it.

You got to be out
of your damn mind.

Why should I believe you?
'Cause we got guns

and we got hostages.

And she who got the gun
makes the motherfucking rules.

Fucking around with Dease.

Waking up--
Fuck Dease.

Don't be so quick to say that--
Man, fuck Dease.

Let me speak
to Captain Dease.

<i>No deal unless I speak</i>
<i>to Captain Dease and that's final.</i>

<i>- So put him on the phone!</i>
Go get his ass.

<i>Bring that motherfucker here.</i>

Give a reason.
Show time, bitch.

Give me a reason.
Bring the motherfucker here!

<i>Who's the bitch now,</i>
<i>motherfucker?</i>

Oh shit.

Tell him.
<i>- You heard her.</i>

Tell him!

<i>- Tell him now!</i>

I killed--
I killed Lil' Mama.

And I killed the doctor.

Call your men off.
Call them off.

That's enough.
You got one hour.

<i>- Let her go!</i>
Fuck you!

<i>Fuck you, you fucking bitch!</i>

Fuck you! Fuck you!
Shoot the motherfucker!

Shoot him!

<i>Shoot him!</i>

That's for Lil' Mama...

that's for Frances...

that's for my babies...
and your babies, motherfucker!

<i>Come around the corner</i>
<i>with your hands up!</i>

Come around the corner
with your hands up!

Wait, Wet!
Where you going?

<i>- Wet, no!</i>

<i>Wet! Wet!</i>

<i>No! Wet!</i>

<i>Everybody,</i>
<i>hold your positions!</i>

Motherfucker.

<i>I got movement</i>
<i>over here at the door!</i>

Wet! No!

Pull back!
Pull back now!

<i>Pull back now.</i>
<i>Pull back. Pull back!</i>

I'm dead. I'm dead.

Oh God. Oh God.

You're okay, baby.

You're okay. Right here with you.
Am I gonna die, Sister Frances?

I'm gonna die, ain't I?
Oh God.

Oh God.
Don't let me die for nothing.

Oh God.

Hold on, Wet.
Hold on.

We right here. You all right.
No. No, Wet, please.

No!
No!

We got that motherfucker good.

We got him good.
Yeah.

Now he know what it feels like
to have something taken from him--

his motherfucking life.

No.

The way I see it...

we got two choices.

We could either wait--
wait here,

have 'em come in here
and get us...

or take our chances,

go out there, and see what
they got coming for us.

<i>In position</i>
<i>on the roof, clear shot at the door.</i>

No. We got one more option.

We could end it all ourselves.
Shit.

What's going on up there?

<i>Cervantes?</i>
<i>Cervantes!</i>

I ain't putting no fucking gun
to my head. Fuck that.

<i>Warden, this is Cervantes.</i>

<i>I'd like to try to talk</i>
<i>them out one last time.</i>

Nikki!

<i>Nikki!</i>

Isn't that Cervantes?
Mm-hmm.

Just like a man to get
a woman to do his dirty work.

Don't you get tired
of ass kissing, Cervantes?

You have your kids
to think about.

I can help you make a deal
with the warden.

Nikki, maybe she's right.

My kids don't even know me.

I been gone so long.

<i>Shut the fuck up, Cervantes!</i>

Stop trying to play us.
It's too fucking late for that!

It's gonna be bad.

Cervantes!

<i>Cervantes, end it now!</i>

"Saditty"?

You do the talking, right?

Yeah, 'cause if they hear your mouth
they're gonna know something's up.

Goddamn right they gonna know
something's up.

Let's do it.

Cervantes! End it now!

Do I have to spell it out
for you?

<i>End it now.</i>
<i>End it now!</i>

<i>Cervantes!</i>
<i>End it now!</i>

End it now!

Come on.
Come on, come on.

Got it.

<i># Yeah #</i>

<i># Yeah, man #</i>

<i># Serious business here #</i>

<i># Murder... #</i>

<i>Now surprisingly,</i>
<i>the one that got the tape out</i>

<i>was Aisha's ass.</i>

<i>And because of that shit,</i>
<i>we won the lawsuit.</i>

<i># Listen here #</i>

<i># It's revolution... #</i>

Ohh,

Nelson got what was
coming to his ass.

But our inmates love
the work they do,

they leave here
with valuable skills

and you have a product you can
market around the world.

<i>By the time the governor</i>
<i>went through Wall Corp.,</i>

they were totally bankrupt.

And I mean, they found
so much shit on Nelson

that they shut
the whole prison down.

And his ass
is under indictment.

Dease, you should've been there!
Sorry I missed it.

My girl Aisha?

She got killed in a fight
not long after the takeover.

<i>I guess she never shook</i>
<i>that prison mentality, you know?</i>

<i>Damn.</i>

That's why we dedicating
our victory

to the memory of my girls.

<i>Wet...</i>

Lil' Mama...

Frances...

and Nikki.

We did the crime
and we had to do the time.

But ain't nobody say nothing
about abuse and exploitation

being part of the sentence.

I'm going back to Chicago
to finish writing my book

and do everything I can
to stay out of jail.

Ain't nothing good
happening up in there.

And now that you know
what I know,

pass the world along.

Please, we got work to do,

and we can't do it
up in no jail.

Oh yeah, don't forget me.
I'm Sabrina,

and that's
my motherfucking life.

<i># You can't do #</i>
