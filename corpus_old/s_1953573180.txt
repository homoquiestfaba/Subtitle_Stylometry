[videotape deck ejecting,
being loaded, humming]


[speaking indistinctly]

[onlooker breathing heavily]

[laughs]

HEY!
[speaking Spanish]

SHH! SHH! NO, NO.
JUST BE QUIET.

SHIT.

SHIT. SHIT. SHIT.

HEY!
HEY!

GET THE FUCK BACK HERE!

HEY, GIVE ME
THAT FUCKING CAMERA!

[indistinct shouts]

YEAH, SO YOU'RE WATCHING
THAT FOOTAGE I SENT?

YEAH, I'M LOOKING, SON,
AND YOU--

SO AS YOU PROBABLY GUESSED,
YOUR WIFE HIRED ME TO GET THAT.

THE PROBLEM IS IF I SHOW IT
TO HER, SHE STOPS PAYING ME.

SO I WAS THINKING YOU MIGHT WANT
TO MAKE A COUNTER-OFFER THERE.

OH, AND WHATEVER NUMBER
YOU COME UP WITH,

YOU CAN PUT 300 BUCKS ON TOP
FOR THE DENT YOU PUT IN MY CAR.

WELL, YOU SCRATCHED THE PAINT
ANYWAY.

YOU KNOW WHAT, IF I DON'T HEAR
FROM YOU BY TOMORROW,

YOUR WIFE GETS THAT FILE.
GOOD-BYE.

[phone beeps off]
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL NOW?

AH, PROBABLY NOTHING.
JUST THIS WOMAN THINKS

HER SON IS MISSING.

HE HASN'T BEEN TO CLASS
IN A WEEK.

HE WON'T ANSWER HER CALLS.

HE'S PROBABLY PASSED OUT
IN A PILE OF BEER CANS.

IN WHICH CASE WE'RE GONNA
TAKE THE KID ON A ROAD TRIP

AND RACK UP SOME EXPENSES,
'CAUSE WE'RE GETTING

1,000 BUCKS A DAY
ON THIS ONE.

TURN LEFT UP HERE.

YOUR BUTTON CAM'S WORKING?

YEAH, IT'S WORKING.

THIS IS IT?

YEAH.

IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ANYONE'S HOME.

SHE COULDN'T GIVE YOU A KEY?

SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
SHE SAID THE LOCK

ON THE BACK WINDOW'S BUSTED,

SO MAYBE WE CAN GET IN
THAT WAY.

AND THE COPS HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE?

NO, THE COPS DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT SOME COLLEGE KID

WHO'S MISSING
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

[dog barking in distance]

HERE.

[sharp bang inside]
IS THERE SOMEONE IN THERE?

HERE.
COME ON, GIVE ME THE CAM.

THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

IT SURE AS FUCK SOUNDED
LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

IT'S AN OLD HOUSE.

BESIDES, IF THERE IS SOMEBODY
IN THERE,

I'M GONNA WANT TO TALK TO 'EM.

HERE.

YOU ALL RIGHT?

JUST GREAT. OW.

YOU OKAY?

[static white noise]

HUH.

UM...
WHAT?

YOU KNOW WHAT?
STAY IN HERE, OKAY?

I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE REST OF THIS APARTMENT

AND MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE IS
IN HERE, OKAY?

YOU GOT YOUR GUN?
YEAH.

ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
JUST--JUST, UM,

PULL ANYTHING RELEVANT
ONTO THAT DRIVE. OKAY?

AND RECORD EVERYTHING.

THAT WAS PART OF THE DEAL.
SHE LIKES ME TO DO THAT.

WELL, YOU TOOK MY CAMERA.

OH. THEN...

ALL RIGHT,
SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

JUST, UM--
JUST, I DON'T KNOW,

SEE WHAT'S ON THAT COMPUTER,
OKAY?

IF IT'S ENCRYPTED,
WE CAN TAKE IT HOME.

IF NOT,
JUST PULL WHAT YOU CAN.

GOT IT.

SHOW HER TITS!
[woman cries out]

[door creaks]

[sighs]
I FOUND A NEW ONE.

IT'S THIRD OR FOURTH GENERATION
FROM THE QUALITY.

I GOT IT FROM SOME GUY DOWN
IN LITTLE ARMENIA

WITH A PAWN SHOP.

HE IS DEFINITELY NOT THE TYPE
OF GUY YOU USUALLY SEE

ON HERE TRADING WITH US,
BUT I THINK HE'S SOMEBODY

WHO'S WORTH
CHECKING IN ON AGAIN.

OKAY.
THAT'S FUCKING WEIRD.

MOST OF HIS COLLECTION,
I WOULD SAY,

WAS SNUFF AND CP,
BUT HE HAD AT LEAST ONE

THAT WAS THE REAL THING.

I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

ANYWAY--
[video paused]

[floor creaks]

[floor creaks]

[static, electronic beeps]

[electronic noise,
distorted voices]

A LITTLE BIT OF REDNESS,
SOME IRRITATION,

BUT IT LOOKS OKAY.
HOW'S IT WORKING?

IT'S GOOD.
YEAH, I CAN SEE,

BUT WHAT ABOUT
MY OTHER EYE?

FOLLOW.
OKAY.

YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
OUT OF YOUR BIOLOGICAL EYE?

NO.

OKAY.
HOW ABOUT NOW?

YEAH.
I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE BETTER.

IT'S JUST KIND OF BLURRY
AND SHADOWY.

YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

WELL, BECAUSE YOUR PROSTHESIS
IS ATTACHED DIRECTLY

TO YOUR VISUAL CORTEX,

YOU REAL EYE'S ESSENTIALLY
BATTLING WITH YOUR CAMERA EYE

TO GIVE YOU INPUT RIGHT NOW.

SO WHEN YOUR BRAIN GETS USED
TO HAVING THAT CHIP IN THERE,

YOU SHOULD START TO SEE
MORE AND MORE

OUT OF YOUR UNINJURED EYE AGAIN.

UNTIL THEN, YOU MIGHT SEE
SOME GLITCHES.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GLITCHES?

WELL, THIS IS JUST BEING
TESTED NOW.

EYE INJURIES LIKE YOURS
ARE QUITE RARE.

SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE INSTALLED
A RECORDING CHIP

INTO THE EYE ITSELF SO WE CAN
TEST THE DATA IT'S RECEIVING.

RIGHT.
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

YES?
OH, MY GOD.

SO IF I WANT PRIVATE TIME,
WHAT DO I DO?

HOW DO I TURN THIS OFF?
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

BUT THAT'S JUST
FOR THIS TRIAL PERIOD.

YOU CAN'T EXPECT
THE KPG CORPORATION TO JUST

GIVE YOU THIS IMPLANT
AND NOT EXPECT TO TEST ITS DATA.

OF COURSE NOT.

SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA SIT AROUND
AND WATCH ME TAKE SHITS?

I'D SAY THAT'S A FAIR
COMPROMISE, MR. MIDDLETON.

YOU CAN READ A NEWSPAPER DURING,
OR SOMETHING.

MM-HMM.

SO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR NEXT WEEK.

WE'LL SEE HOW IT'S WORKING.

CALL ME IF YOU HAVE
ANY CONCERNS.

ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

[voice drones over p.a.]

WHAT THE HELL?

[pop music playing
on car radio]

¶

ALL RIGHT, MAN.
ALL RIGHT.

YOU SURE YOU GONNA
BE OKAY, BUD?

YEAH, DUDE, I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

GIVE ME A SHOUT
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

SEE YA.

HELLO?

HELLO?
OH, COME ON.

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?

OH, SHIT.

JESUS! FUCK!

OH, SHIT.

YEAH. YEAH, I CAN TELL
THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN A BURST OF LIGHT AND
A FUCKING BLOODY PERSON, OKAY?

I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

LOOK, I'M COMING IN THERE
TOMORROW, AND YOU'RE GONNA FIX

THIS FUCKING THING,
AND THAT'S THAT, OKAY?

FINE.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

[sighs heavily]

[scrape, brief clatter]

HELLO?

IS SOMEBODY DOWN THERE?

SERIOUSLY,
DON'T FUCK WITH ME.

OH, GOD DAMN IT.

HELLO?
[floor creaking]

SHIT!


OH, FUCK.
[heavy bang]

WHAT THE FUCK?

[heavy bang on door]


HELLO?
[heavy bang]

SHIT! UH, OKAY!

I'M GOOD.
THANK YOU, YOU CAN GO.

OH, SHIT!

OH, FUCK!
[panicked breathing]

OH, MY GOD.

GOD DAMN IT.

[relieved sighs]

[doorbell chimes distortedly]

OH, SHIT.


OH, SHIT.

HEY, ARE YOU IN THERE?

LOOK, I CAN SEE YOU
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE.

WEREN'T YOU AT THE DOCTOR'S
OFFICE YESTERDAY?

YEAH.

OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.
LOOK, JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

BUT IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
YOU KNOW?

LOOK, ARE YOU SEEING
WEIRD STUFF?

LIKE PEOPLE WHO LOOK DEAD?

YOU SHOULD REALLY
OPEN THE DOOR.

[sighs]

THANK YOU.
I'M CLARISSA.

YEAH, COME ON IN.

NICE PLACE, MAN.
THANKS.

DO YOU HAVE ANY BEER?

I DO. YES.

WHAT ABOUT PAINKILLERS?
DID THE DOCTOR GIVE YOU ANY?

NO, I'M NOT ACTUALLY
IN ANY PAIN.

I'LL JUST TAKE A BEER THEN.

LOOK, CLARISSA, I'M ACTUALLY
ON MY WAY OUT OF HERE.

DUDE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET ANYWHERE

IF YOU DON'T HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

JUST GIVE ME A BEER,
GET ONE FOR YOURSELF.

YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

RIGHT.

THANKS.
SURE.

I WAS BORN DEAF.

WHEN I WAS 16,
MY PARENTS PUT ME UP

FOR A NEW COCHLEAR IMPLANT.

IT WORKED, OBVIOUSLY.

BUT I BEGAN TO BE ABLE
TO PICK UP

CERTAIN FREQUENCIES
IN MY ENVIRONMENTS.

WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE ANYWAY?

I WAS IN A, UM--
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

SO WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL?

WHAT LITTLE GIRL?

THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL HERE.

I HEARD HER CRYING
WHEN I CAME IN.

BUT YOU KNOW...

I DON'T HEAR HER NOW.

SOME PEOPLE NEVER HEAR THEM
OR SEE THEM.

MAYBE ONCE
IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES,

IF THEY'RE OPEN TO IT.

SO WHEN YOU CAN SENSE THEM,
THEY KNOW.

THEY CAN TELL.

THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO FIND YOU.
TO WARN YOU.

WARN ME ABOUT WHAT?

YEAH.

THE MORE YOU INTERACT
WITH THEM,

THE MORE THEY CAN TOUCH YOU,

HURT YOU, STUFF.

WELL, TOMORROW I'M GONNA
GET THIS FUCKIN' THING

TAKEN OUT OF MY HEAD,
AND THAT'LL BE THAT, RIGHT?

DON'T BE SO SURE.

HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING BAD
TO ANYBODY?

LOOK, IF YOU GET THE IMPLANT
TAKEN OUT,

THEY'RE STILL GONNA
BE THERE.

YOU'RE JUST NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SEE THEM.

I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE THAT'S BETTER.

WELL, I GUESS.
OH, SHIT!

UM, I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU
RIGHT NOW,

BUT THERE'S A FUCKING CREEPY
DUDE STANDING RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

I KNOW.
I CAN HEAR HIM.

DO YOU KNOW HIM OR SOMETHING?
HE WAS MY UNCLE.

OH, OF COURSE, RIGHT.
I MEAN--

WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
CALL HIM CREEPY, BUT I MEAN--

HE WASN'T A NICE PERSON.

OKAY...
[techno dance music plays]

LISTEN, I KNOW HOW
TO MAKE HIM GO AWAY.

JUST FOCUS ON ME.
OKAY.

OH!

OH, SHIT.

NO, DON'T LOOK AT HIM,
LOOK AT ME.

¶

OH, SHIT.

ALL RIGHT,

I WANT A COPY OF THAT FOOTAGE.

LIKE, I WANT YOU TO PUT IT

OH, SHIT!

LARRY.

HEY, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
WHAT?

WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.

I JUST WATCHED SOMETHING
REALLY WEIRD.

IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN REAL,
SO--

OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING
ON THAT COMPUTER?

I'M CLONING
HIS HARD DRIVE NOW.

IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

TAPE IS THE FINAL LINK
FOR ME.

I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE POSTED
THAT IT ONLY AFFECTS YOU

IF YOU PLAY IT
IN A CORRECT SEQUENCE.

BUT I'VE BEEN
EXPERIMENTING ON--

[volume off]
IS THIS THE KID?

YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

I FOUND SOME NOTEBOOKS
IN HIS ROOM.

KIND OF LIKE JOURNALS.
MOSTLY JUST NONSENSE, THOUGH.

I'M GOING THROUGH THEM
RIGHT NOW.

WHY DON'T YOU, LIKE, KEEP
LOOKING AT THESE TAPES?

KID'S A COLLECTOR.
I DON'T KNOW. WHO KNOWS?

MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING RELEVANT
ON THEM.

OH. UM...
OKAY.

WE'RE ALL JUST
ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY,

THEN THESE ANALOG TAPES
CAPTURING IMAGES

OF THE SUPERNATURAL,

THEY CAN AFFECT
OUR CEREBRAL CORTEX.

MIKE SULLIVAN.

WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING BREAKFAST.

A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

I JUST WANT TO TAKE THE BIKE OUT
FOR A SPIN.

I WANTED YOU TO TAKE ME
FOR A SPIN.

YOU KNOW, YOU RIDE THAT BIKE
MORE THAN YOU RIDE ME.

YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW THE BIKE
IS JUST A PHYSICAL THING, BABE.

THERE'S NO TRAIL HERE.

THIS DOESN'T LOOK FAMILIAR

I MEAN IT'S PRETTY,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH.

HOLY SHIT.

I THINK SO.

IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN BIT

WHAT COULD HAVE DONE THIS?

I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

AN ANIMAL?
YES, HELLO.

WE FOUND SOMEONE.
HE'S, LIKE, COVERED IN BLOOD,

AND THERE'S NO PULSE.

WE'RE ON THE BIKE TRAILS AND--

I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN
BIT BY SOMETHING.

IT'S A BITE, RIGHT?
THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS.

WHAT STATE PARK IS THIS?
I DON'T REMEMBER.

THIS IS GOLD STONE STATE PARK.

YEAH, WE'RE AT GOLD STONE
