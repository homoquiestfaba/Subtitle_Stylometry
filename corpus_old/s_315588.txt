<i>He's got a girlfriend!</i>
<i>He's got a girlfriend!</i>

<i>He's got a girlfriend!</i>

<i>What?</i>
<i>Drunk in a rain like this?</i>

<i>By the way, let's have a drink.</i>

<i>- But...</i>
<i>- Hey, hey...</i>

I thought of a short story
to write tomorrow.

Got a happy ending?
0therwise, I won't publish it.

It'll be an epic, it starts
long ago, let's say, in 1980.

Be prepared for a shitty ending
with old fogey people!

What?
Well...

Have I said it's raining?
We're getting soaked wet!

Shut up, Antonio!

Let me tell you how it starts:

Recent news! Extra! Extra!

Recent news! Extra!

<i>That's how I first met her.</i>
<i>Where did you want me to start?</i>

<i>It is not an original start, but</i>
<i>it's classic and has substance.</i>

<i>Let geniuses play around with</i>
<i>story form, not me.</i>

<i>I'm just Jorge Pellegrini, granted</i>
<i>Best New Writer Award in 1974...</i>

<i>and America Award in 1975...</i>

<i>which I spent on a trip</i>
<i>to Europe in 1976.</i>

<i>3 months later, Europe was riding</i>
<i>high, Argentina was in deep water...</i>

<i>and I was in Argentina.</i>

<i>What was I to do? So many ideas,</i>
<i>so much talent, so little reward?</i>

Jorgito! If I weren't dying to take
a piss, I'd hug you!

<i>Keep on writing, wherever.</i>
<i>This magazine's called "Things".</i>

<i>Affectionately nicknamed</i>
<i>"Little Thingy".</i>

<i>I trust you won't show up</i>
<i>at closing day.</i>

Longer than 4 pages I can't publish.

<i>Well, don't ever show up.</i>

I'll get this call, Pepa.
Five pages, but they're superb.

Five superb won't do.
Three "average" will.

"Average" is just perfect for this
magazine. We like average.

We must squeeze to fit
one page less this week.

You probably cut out the dream
about the roller coaster...

...and her friends, dead and alive.
It didn't make sense, Jorge!

Beautiful, but didn't make sense.

It's the only sign of her desire.

With no such dream, what would she
want? Who would she look for?

Who would be interested?
Come here, Micky.

Do me a favor, will you?
Bring me two pounds of coffee.

I'm working late tonight.
Sure, Mr. Márquez.

Anything else?
Hey, Micky! Micky, come here!

You're in a tight spot, huh?

Who will you please first?

Your mentor, your colleague,
your role model, your friend...

or the director?

Hard choice, isn't it?

Go ahead and see what she wants,
don't be silly.

I'll bring your coffee on my
way back, Mr. Márquez.

<i>- Mr. Roberto?</i>
Yes, what is it?

<i>Mr. Mastronardi is here.</i>

Holly shit! Haven't I told you
I'm busy and can't see Mastronardi?

Mastronardi!
What's up, Jorgito, how are you?

How are you?
What's up, Márquez?

So, how are things?
Got a placement yet?

Roberto, can I have a word with you?

Sure.

Will you stay here?
Long time no see, how are you?

Should we go upstairs to talk?

We can be more at ease there.
All right.

Uncle grandpa Márquez looks sad.
Let's see what's up with him.

This crossword is so difficult.
I can't get it right.

River that runs in Northern Italy.
Two-letter word.

Do you know what it is?
You really don't know?

If I knew I wouldn't be asking...
River Po, you dummy!

Po! Holly cow! 0f course!

What do you want? Money?
No, I've still got some.

The point is I'm going mad.
I'm a journalist, you see?

Don't tell me there's no job for me.
I'll take the counseling column.

But I'm just a John Doe here,
Mastronardi.

No way, sir.

You're the secretary
of this magazine.

Just give me the lowliest job.

Give you the lowliest job?
Are you nuts?

I will never agree to this.

You see? You should've
stayed in Spain.

You were getting along just fine,
why did you come back?

If you can't understand the
journalist, let alone the homesick.

You're the one to blame,
pulling a tough guy attitude.

What were you thinking?
Writing against censorship?

In this magazine, censorship or not,
we're always talking nonsense.

Thank God you left in time.

Now's different. There's some ground
for action, that's why I came back.

Dear friend, you never change.
"Ground for action"?

The black lists keep
on going, man.

There's no way I can give you a job,
Mastronardi, no way.

Fuck, man, you're making
me feel like shit.

Sorry, I didn't mean to.
You have no idea how I like you.

After all, who brought
you to the magazine?

Who taught you everything you know?

Who gave you your first assignment?

The last thing I want is to make
you feel like shit, buddy.

Let's go, Sebi. Bye, everyone!
See you around, okay?

Mastronardi?
What?

Are you all right?

When can you come and dine with us?

Sonia's always asking about you.
0K, but this time it's on me.

Let's be fair. Ten thousand
dinners on you, one on me.

Are you sure everything is fine?

You know the director, don't you?
Yes.

If you, please,
could talk to her...

I know her,
but I'm not that close.

But I'll see what I can do.

Hi, Jorge.
Hi, Leti.

Leti, can you hold on?
I have to talk to her.

I'll call you so we can schedule
something, 0K? Great.

Give Sonia a kiss from me,
but not too hot.

Bye, Sebi.
Bye.

Leti...

Leti!

Leti, are you busy tonight?
Not at all.

So, how about going out
for movie and dinner?

0kay. What are we watching?

BASED 0N THE SH0RT ST0RY
<i>Although they're not among the best...</i>

"SCRAPS", BY J0RGE PELLEGRINI
<i>my stories have made to the screen.</i>

<i>To the Cineclub screen, to be exact.</i>

<i>This short film was based</i>
<i>on a short story I wrote.</i>

<i>To feel that through my work</i>
<i>a twin soul is a common cause...</i>

<i>a diapason and its resonance...</i>

<i>A jackass was in charge</i>
<i>of the lights...</i>

<i>and a drunkard son of a gun</i>
<i>of the cameras!</i>

N0VEMBER - TUESDAY

<i>Oh, come on!</i>

<i>It's over!</i>

<i>Very good, very good!</i>

Excuse me.

I'm getting out, sorry.
I'm getting out, sorry.

A FILM BY MANLl0 CALD0SINI

Well, thank you so much for coming.

Your presence is very important.

My work speaks for itself.
Let's hear what you have to say.

Let's get into what
I'd call a debate.

Sorry, man, but what did
you mean with this film?

Really, man...

your attitude is so gross...

you make me feel like a victim
of low pressure with such comment.

I have to come out and state the
obvious: Art can't be explained.

You can't explain art. If you can
understand, fine; if you can't, fine.

If you liked, fine;
if you didn't, fine.

If you can feel it, fine;
If you can't, fine.

End of debate!

Well, to wrap it up,
I want to thank the person who...

is the real brain
behind all this, 0K?

I'm talking about Jorge Pellegrini,
author of the original short story.

Let's hear it for Jorge.

Jorge, I think this was
a good mix between...

your flight and my...
my "nothing".

You took off and I just
tagged along.

Thank you. Well, my
short story is one thing...

and this...

This is yours, from head to toe.

From head to toe.

I swear it's yours even risking
to be stabbed to death in my back.

Excuse me.

Excuse me...

Why did you emphasize
the "repressive"?

"Repressive"?
I'm sorry, really sorry.

Did I hurt you?
No, I'm fine.

I'm so sorry, I didn't know.
That's okay.

Say, want a cigarette?
No, I've quit smoking.

I loved your performance.
0kay, just one.

Did you study or is just instinct?
Are you an expert?

Sorry, please, how should I know
you'd be there, spying on us?

Sorry.

Did you enjoy the movie?

I like how he deals with symbols.
I thought it was awful.

Me too, but the way
he uses symbols is nice.

It's exactly the way he uses
symbols that I found awful!

Yeah, me too.

But you can't laugh, you're the
short story's author.

What short story? He ruined it!
There was nothing left.

The only thing I really liked...

was the scene when you let
rain fall on your face.

Seriously, you liked that?
I loved it.

It was my idea. I fought
with everyone for it.

When I set my mind to something...
Unbelievable!

That's the kind of thing I do.

I love driving with
the window down...

to feel the rain on my face.

I like it so much
that I want to use in a story.

A pack of Parissiennes, please?

It's $ 1.800.

Thanks.

Do you believe in fate?
Either you do or you get done.

When Manlio showed me your
story I said "finally!"

I've been reading your work since
it came out in "Golden Scarab".

Really?
Yes.

I loved your short stories.

They were stronger...
more political...

Now they are more...
Humane?

That's it. Right.

Such good story made into something
that serves nothing but his ego!

"To serve or not to serve,
that's the question"?

It might be a "professional
malformation", since I serve...

in a restaurant. I'm a waitress.

Have one of my cards.

"Alfonsina del Mar"?

You don't say! Considering your age,
I thought of a name as "Graciela"...

Monica...
No, my name is Laura.

"Alfonsina del Mar" is where I work.

Jorge... Pellegrini.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

I loved your short story.
You have something of Cortázar.

Yes, a poster.

I'm serious, something like "paths
that never cross each other".

0n a second reading, you realize
that the character needs to do...

something remarkable...

that, when people
listen to it or read it...

it'll somehow make
a change in their lives.

It touched my heart.

"0n a second reading"?

Wanna go somewhere for a drink?

There you are! You ran away!
Marita.

Laurita,
I didn't understand a thing!

This is Jorge Pellegrini,
the short story writer.

Marita, my friend.
How do you do?

It was an interesting idea,
you looked beautiful, Laura...

...but I didn't understand a thing.
Let's have something to drink?

We gotta go to work.
All right.

Yes.
Let's go.

Bye.
Bye.

Bye.
Bye.

So let's have dinner?
You know what?

I can't find the meal tickets.
I think I've lost them.

That's 0K, let's go somewhere else.
You know what, Leti?

I gotta wake up early,
too many things to do.

I'll tell you what:

Let's have some coffee and
I'll take you home afterwards.

I don't know what's got into me,
I'm up to my neck in work!

<i>Who was the first</i>
<i>to touch the sky?</i>

<i>Who created the "set phrases"?</i>

<i>Who said the first sayings?</i>

Who pooped this shit?
Come on, it is not that bad.

It sounds too obvious.

"When he first met her, he felt
feelings he'd never felt before".

What's with you? Drank a whole
bottle of "wordanax"?

I know the magazine portrays simple
themes, but you were always good.

You're right, you're always right.
What's this, a new story?

I hope it's good,
the other one stinks.

Why? Who said so?
I said so.

But why? What's the problem?
What's the problem?

You bad-mouthed the church.
You say there's no heaven.

I won't publish that,
they could send you to hell.

And believe me, there is a hell.
Hold on.

I wrote this story for the magazine
and I want it published!

Roberto, Sonia Mastronardi
is on the phone.

When will you listen to me?

Haven't I told you
I'm not here for Mastronardi?

I'll get it.

Hello, Sonia, it's Jorge. Sorry
I haven't called, I totally forgot.

Let me talk to Alfredo,
he probably wants to kill me...

What? Yes...

Yes, I'm still here.

How was it?
How did it happen?

Yes.

Where?
Where will you?

Yes, yes.

No, we're heading
down there this minute.

Yes, darling. Bye...

We're going to there right away.

It was... a stroke, I guess.

Sonia found him...

over the typewriter. I don't
know what he was writing.

I should've met him last week.

I'm such an asshole!

I'm an asshole.

An asshole...

WHEN THE LAST MINUTE

0F HIS LIFE STARTED

MASTR0NARDI

WR0TE:

"ALF0NSINA DEL MAR"

I love working for the wealthy.
See this fat bill all torn?

Do you like
that guy at table 5?

So distinguished.
I'm fucking him tonight.

He looks like those
"Ford Fairlane" ads.

He also looks like he's married.

Deadly war, casualties don't count.

Who cares if he's married?

Want to learn how to do it?
Look.

So you came!
So I did.

We've just met and already
have nothing to talk about?

May I?

Thank you.
You could be more careful!

Shit! "Beer, come
this way, please"!

Let it go,
I'm getting my bonus tomorrow.

No way. Do you want
peanuts crumbs?

No, thanks. I'll ask the
waiter to wrap it up to go.

You didn't finish the
thing about Accountancy.

How do you know?

You were shoved when you were...

0h, I didn't finish telling you.

I didn't finish college either.
Really?

I dropped out
when I met my boyfriend.

Your boyfriend? I see...

Excuse me?
Sure.

Do you have a boyfriend?

You have peanuts on your...

0h, my.

No, I'm kidding.

So you have a boyfriend.

He made you quit college,
I don't get it.

No, I decided to quit.

There are more accountants than
companies in this country.

And no guts to do anything.

When I met Esteban and saw his
paintings, I felt like painting.

Truly.
Are you taking art lessons now?

I'm not sure that's what I want.
Really?

A tight spot.
The thing is...

I look at other painters' work such
as Van Gogh's, Renoir's, Esteban's...

Shit, what a threesome!
Resembles a military junta!

I'm serious!

Esteban's paintings are so striking.
You must see them.

When he gets back,
I'll introduce you two.

Back form where?
Montevideo.

He was invited to take part
in an exhibit of young artists.

Great! And why didn't
you go with him?

I saw no reason to.

What would I do there?
I'm going to prepare...

an exhibit for him here. He's very
talented, he'll do just fine.

And when I set
my mind to something...

Very well, gentlemen!
Good evening!

Just keep yourselves calm
and show me some ID!

Cardoso, take the other side.
Yes, sir.

Your ID, miss!
I haven't got it.

Quiet, come on!

Come on! Hurry up!
Come on, get inside!

You, put that cigarette out!

0ne by one.
Come on! Get inside, hurry.

Go on, I said. Come on, hurry.

Come on.

Excuse me, officer,
I was in there.

You asked for my ID,
I showed it to you.

The girl I was with
didn't bring her ID...

I know she has it, she just didn't
bring it. She paints walls...

I mean, she paints interiors,
not outdoor stuff...

She left her ID at home.

She didn't do anything.

She's with me,
I'm responsible for her.

And who the hell are you?
What?

Man, you got a cigarette?
No.

Are you worried?

Did they make you "play the piano"?

Sure. Why?
Don't worry.

It's bad if they don't take your
fingerprints, then you're a goner.

Laura.

Laura...

Laura...
I'm here, I'm right here.

Are you all right?
Yes.

Let me hold your hand.
What?

Your hand.

What is going to happen now?
Nothing.

Don't be scared.
No...

I'm fine.

How was dinner?
He's a good catch! Ask him...

...if he's got any friends.
He went to jail...

...just to stay with me.
Sucker, he should've...

followed you, called your parents
and gotten you out.

That would've been smart.

That's what Esteban would've done.
That's a smart guy.

He got lost in Montevideo,
but he's smart.

This guy is a screw-up.
What does he do? He screws up.

I'm not criticizing him. Any sucker
would've done the same.

And you loved it, huh?

I've just gotten to know him.
Good heavens!

But I know you,
and I know you like him.

And why? Because
you're a sucker too.

Enough!
Tell me if I'm lying.

You quit accountancy
to be an artist in Argentina...

which is the same as being
an innkeeper in the South Pole.

You gave up your life for an idiot
who never calls you...

He must be busy.
In Montevideo? You're sucker, see?

He should've returned a week ago.
Never called to say he's sorry.

I've changed my mind: He's not an
idiot, he's a sucker just like you.

Twin souls:
Pelopincho y Cachirula.

That's old!
Why should you stand...

a guy who never calls when you can
choose among so many suckers?

Jorge is a great writer.
He's not a sucker.

Who mentioned Jorge?
I was talking of Esteban.

You're a bit messed-up,
aren't you?

No, I've been dating Esteban
for a year and a half now.

That's very clear to me.

Excuse me.
Come in.

I can only stay 5 minutes.
Yeah, I know.

Sorry about the mess.

The maid comes every 0ctober, but she
didn't show up precisely in this one.

You know I haven't got much time?
I do.

I just want to give you a present.

I should've given it already,
but I just forgot.

Well...

I feel I know you a bit, and
I think you're gonna like it.

No!
Yes!

I love this book!

Don't you like this book?
I like you.

This guy's great.
What's his name?

Jorge.

Are you nervous?

Well...

If you don't mind
I have a boyfriend...

No...
Yes. Sure, yes...

If you want us
to get laid, all right.

Why would that matter?
Why do you say you got a boyfriend?

He hasn't called you in 2 months.
That's my problem, all right?

You're nervous.
I don't want to get laid with you!

I thought so.
Well, I do, but...

What else do you want?
Do you want me to tell you...

that I want you, I adore you, I love
you? 0kay! I want you, I love you.

But it sounds corny
if it's out of context. Look:

I want you, I adore you, I love you!
Is it corny or not?

Well, it didn't sound very nice.
You see?

I tell you what.

I'll call you.

So...

if I can finally come up with
a context, I'll call you.

I'm such an idiot.

Such an idiot!

<i>I, Jorge Pellegrini, overwhelmed by</i>
<i>the passion that got a hold of me...</i>

<i>have decided to write a journal...</i>

<i>like my illustrious predecessors:</i>
<i>Anne Frank, Mafalda and Little Lulu.</i>

<i>Let's start:</i>

<i>October 14,</i> 1980.

<i>She didn't call me today.</i>

<i>Neither today.</i>

<i>10 days and she hasn't called me.</i>

It's personal.
Go to hell.

<i>November, 2nd.</i>

<i>A month has passed since I began a
<i>journal to clear up my feelings.</i>

<i>Since Laura didn't have the nerve</i>
<i>to call me, I want her...</i>

<i>my feelings and this journal</i>
<i>to go to hell!</i>

<i>Look, mister! Mister!</i>
<i>Look, Mr. Kid.</i>

<i>I know you don't take alms.</i>
<i>This is an invitation.</i>

<i>We can split it, if you want.</i>

Alrighty, then.
Let's split.

<i>That was no split.</i>
<i>It was the cube root.</i>

<i>There are 3 prophecies</i>
<i>and 3 warrants.</i>

<i>- 3 prophecies and 3 warrants?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

<i>The first prophecy says</i>
<i>someone will come after you.</i>

Hello?

Laura? Laura who?

Laura, of course. I'm sorry.

No, I was a bit absent-minded.

Are you okay?
I was... working.

<i>- 1st one to get will have bad luck.</i>
When?

<i>The second prophecy says:</i>

<i>- A beautiful woman will come by.</i>
I don't know...

No, that's okay.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

Great.

Sorry I was late.

That's 0K. You said 30 minutes,
it's been only 20.

Not so bad. Want a coffee?
Yes... Jorge!

Sorry I didn't call you before.

When? Don't worry.
I was awfully busy.

Look...

I'm not able to date
two guys at the same time.

I see.
I'm not like that, you know?

Yes, I know.

So before starting
anything with you...

I wanted to make sure I didn't
want to wait for him anymore.

Don't worry. Thank you for being
sincere and telling me that.

What?
I will not wait for him anymore.

Can I ask you one thing?
Can I count on you?

Yes, you can ask whatever you want.
That's it.

If I can count on you.
Sure.

If you never let me down,
I'll never let you down.

You know that when I set
my mind to something...

Look at me.

Look into my eyes...

0h, my love!

My love. My love...

Enough!

Shut up, please.

"And started crying like before,
for Natalio's love had taught her...

that, to show what she wanted,
she should look into her heart."

Sounds corny.

Why?
Well... it sounds like...

It is not serious, is it?

Why isn't it serious?

I don't get it why you have
to speak of love in terms of...

pain and suffering.

There are other things
to portray a couple.

If you sound too... too...

yawpy...

"Yawpy"? What is "yawpy"?
Yawpy. Yawpy.

Fluffy. Yawpy.

Fluffy? This is fluffy?
Yes, it is fluffy.

No, not fluffy!
Yes, it is fluffy.

No good? Isn't it beautiful?
No, you're beautiful. This is blah.

No, you're a bad girl...
No...

You're a mean little witch.
No, I'm good.

A bad witch.
No, I'm good.

You're mean, not good.
I'm a good girl.

You're beautiful and I'm good.

Yes, no! No, no, no, no!

Aunt Pelusa's staying home...

some days to recover from surgery.

I don't mind, a woman doesn't get
her ovaries taken out every day.

The point is, I finally convinced
Gerardo to come upstairs.

He's kind of slow, and we were
in such a heat making out...

I was totally horny,
when out comes...

aunt Pelusa in a nightgown,
her ovaries in a jar.

I was... What's that? Don't
get into artistry, I'll show you.

There, there and there. She wanted
to change the jar water.

It was kind of dark.
It was like a horror movie!

Gerardo apologized,
got up and left...

I thought he was going to the
bathroom, but he left for never more.

What a darn sucker!

You're really crazy.

I'm leaving, Marita,
I'm quitting.

Quitting? 0ut of the blue?

Things can't be hurried like that.
Don't be a sucker.

Good evening, Mr. Pellegrini.
A romantic dinner?

No, they cut the power off...

I'm using the occasion to celebrate
three very important events.

So tell me.
The first one...

is that I'm so horny tonight...

I raise my glass...
Second...

...it's our anniversary.
What do you mean?

Well, I'm one month ahead of time, but
power can be restored and... bye-bye.

Even the spoon tastes good.
True.

So?

What's the third event?

I'm pregnant.

No need to be afraid, buddy!
0f course I'm not pregnant.

No.
Don't worry.

No, it's okay.
It was a joke.

It's a surprise a bit...
Sorry, listen:

I left my job.
Why? What happened?

Nothing, that's why.
I got sick of it and quit.

You dove headfirst, just like that?

I got another job. I quit at 11 a.m.
And by 6 p.m. I had another job.

Now I'm a producer for a radio
program about visual arts.

A friend from college. I called him,
told him I wanted to work and done!

I'll start tomorrow.

The guys have no clues,
I have to prepare the agenda.

I'll begin by calling some people.

Cool. What station is it?

I don't know, a radio station.

But production?

I mean, are you going
to stop painting?

No! No! Why should I?

No, okay. As long as they pay you
well. Are they paying you well?

Want some more coffee?
No, thanks.

What's the matter?
Don't tell me they won't pay you.

No, they won't pay me.

If the program takes off, they will.

I'm so happy.

Well... I was happy.
I'm so sorry. Sorry, you're right.

It caught me by surprise,
I'm very happy. Very happy.

No short stories this week. I have
to publish Vilas' work. Can't miss.

Vilas again?
Another of his novels?

What novels? Poetry.

You're kidding.

I didn't say "Decorative Art",
I said "Art Déco".

They're not the same! 0ne is
architecture, the other, decoration.

Another is you,
for I can't label you.

Wait a minute.
Are you okay, love?

Well, I have a little problem.

0ne second. Hello?
Are you going to stay there?

What's the matter?
Nothing. Well, they won't...

...publish my story this week.
Why not?

They want to cut part of it. I said
either publish everything or nothing.

Very good.
There's nothing in this house?

What do you want?
Coffee.

They'll publish some shit of theirs.
Let them go to hell!

It's easy for you to say that.
I don't have the option...

of working for free.
I'm going out for coffee.

<i>The imports fever came back.</i>

<i>This time, English fabrics...</i>

<i>gained the streets</i>
<i>in a first rate army.</i>

Are you making a toast?
<i>- Argentina nation rises up...</i>

Now it is good!
Colors! That's it!

<i>The government, drunk with pride</i>
<i>due to the country's success...</i>

<i>decided to extend its horizons</i>
<i>and our capacity to feel awe.</i>

<i>To the great Argentine people!</i>
<i>Cheers!</i>

I'm going to the Foreign Ministry.
Can't miss this glorious journey.

English arrogance kneeled
before native alcoholism...

Silvia, it's not my fault
if the check bounced.

"Whose fault is it"? Economics'!
Don't you read the papers?

The sum I spent on Marianna's
dance classes...

and Camilo's karate classes
could feed the entire continent!

Come at 5:00 p.m.
And get another check.

Not at 4:30! I'm working at this time.
Something you could do too.

I said at 5:00, Silvia!
Can't you understand? Fuck!

At five, I said!
Five, five!

I'm sure she'll get here
at 4:30, dammit!

Man, if it weren't for the kids,
I assure you...

Read this, my story can
amuse you a bit.

It's about a woman split
between two passions.

Sorry, but with
all this mess of war...

Why don't you set the story
around the English invasion?

Sorry, Roberto.
Is the coffee bad?

It's awful. Bring me some milk,
I feel a heart-burn.

Diego, what's happening
with the coffee?

I spoke to NY, got Zicarelli on line.
What should I tell him?

To never come back.
0K, you silly, the lines are bad!

Roberto, if I can rewrite it
by tomorrow, will you publish?

Do that, but with all this mess...

I can't promise you anything,
Jorgito.

Pellegrini, what's up,
are you sad?

No, not sad.
A bit worried.

I have a bad feeling
about all this.

How is Laura?
That's the least of my problems.

"The least"?
What's the matter?

We've been together
for a year and a half now.

A couple has its bad moments,
but everything is fine.

That means it's a shit.

No, no, she's
focused on her things now.

I think you just need
some fresh air.

It wouldn't do the
couple any harm.

It can be good.

Talk to someone who is not so
worried about her own career.

Someone who appreciates
you better, Jorge.

That sounds a little selfish.
Yes, it's a bit complicated.

Let's have some coffee later?

You might be right.

That can make me feel better.

Take care not to drop it again.
Yeah, I know.

<i>Carola was a rich</i>
<i>and complex human being...</i>

<i>with dreams, goals,</i>
<i>frustrations and sorrows...</i>

<i>but in respect of the whole,</i>
<i>that's beside the point.</i>

<i>To me, she meant a sort of escape,</i>
<i>fresh air, a pinch of salt...</i>

<i>to season the salad</i>
<i>I had in my mind.</i>

<i>As long as she saw me as an innocent</i>
<i>fantasy, what harm could I do?</i>

How are you?
Hi, my love.

I'm compiling your short stories
that were never published.

You can come out with a book or two.
A very good one, for sure!

Laura, I don't like the idea
of my desk being cleaned.

Not your desk, your life.
You have excellent ideas.

Just drop the corny ideas
they make you write about.

Nobody makes me write about anything!

By choosing someone else to publish
they get you to write something else.

This one here, for instance, about
the dead journalist, what's his name?

Mastronardi.
Give me that!

It has more substance than the love
stories you write to the magazine.

Don't mess around with my stuff!
That's nothing!

It can't be nothing, you tried
to start it 4 times already.

If you're stuck, I can help!
What do you know about this?

Nobody has interest in that!
I don't agree!

This magazine is making you
waste your time...

...you're stuck!
I'm not stuck.

I make my living from what I write.
That's far more than many people do.

I don't mind if you don't make
money, I want you to be a writer.

Since when are you a critic?
What do you know of that?

I don't know about that,
but I know of you.

And they don't publish
your best at there!

Give me a break, will you?
Who is going after the editors?

Who's willing to knock at all doors
and get negative answers?

I am. Why don't you go back to writing
the old themes? They were stronger!

No one can write about
that anymore, Laura.

Don't tell me you're afraid?

What are you talking about?
What do you know of fear?

Why don't you write them
yourself if you know so much?

Because I have no talent,
but you do.

You can be a great writer
just need a push.

I might be good at that, let me try.

I don't want to see you rotting
over the same old shit.

Now I know why that other guy
never called you.

What are you doing?
Be careful, fuck!

Don't make me nervous,
or I'll screw up!

You screwed up, scratched the car!
You make me nervous, that's why!

All the time complaining of Laura!
Get out there, can't come out here.

You say your girlfriend is a pain,
but want to introduce her friend to me!

Look where you parked the car!
How can't I be nervous?

Who's put this column here?
Wait a minute.

Say, do I have bad breath?
No...

What did you say the girl does?
I don't know, ask her.

She might be one of those
intellectuals I hate.

No, she's a common girl!

What if she's some corny girl?

"What if", "What if",
get a grip, speak up!

You animal! A corny girl?
No, don't get nervous!

What did you eat today, Roberto?

Hey, boys!

I think I want to back off.

They saw you, silly.
No way out.

Come on, hurry up.
Hi, girls, are you 0K?

Hi, waited too long?
Not at all.

52 minutes.
But we're at war.

Journalism stuff.
Roberto, this is Marita.

Roberto! Pretty name! I liked it!
Well...

Well, I liked it.

You guys work very hard.
I'll say...

When they say journalism is an
apostolate, they are right.

We lie more than Saint Peter.

Don't you agree, Jorge?
Yes, it's a tight spot.

It is a fascinating job.

Can one get into cinema,
theater and all that?

0f course.
That's sweet.

Think of it, Roberto,
my mom was all alone...

There should be someone to care for
her, would I send her to hospital?

My father had left us 10 years
before, never returned, useless.

So I was beside her
until she passed away.

Family comes first, of course.
I think so too.

Don't you, Jorge?
I never got along with my father.

But that's something else, huh?

That talking deserves
some especial occasion.

You said you found your artistic vein
through handicrafts?

That's beautiful.

Why did you get divorced?

Things get tiresome after a while.

Well, we didn't have fun anymore.

We just complained, see?

In the last six years, I'd say.

You never thought of getting back?
No.

Are you sure?
0f course I am.

Really?
Yes.

But you're still in love with her?

No.
Are you sure?

So you have to stick your hand
in it to shape it up, see?

Hands are very important,
even if they don't seem to be.

Do not underestimate yourself.
Did you read Dalí's memoirs?

"The Unspeakable Confessions".
No. No...

I started, but didn't finish.

You knew Dalí started like that?

In his book he says
he started with handicrafts.

Are you affectionate?
When I want, I want.

I'm very intense. I suffer intensely
and have intense pleasure.

Are you intense?
So much.

Well, I had a lot of fun, in fact.

That's a great place.

Expensive.
Beautiful.

Are you working tomorrow?
Why? Let's go somewhere else?

Yes! You guys really
don't want to go?

Let's go just the two of us.
All right, let's go.

See you, guys.
See you.

Where can we get some coffee?

I know of a great place where
they have an excellent chocolate.

It sounds delicious!

It worked all right.

Great Jorgito, my hero!
Thanks for coming, my dear.

What happened?
Where is everybody?

Last night was closing,
everyone gets in later today.

I don't know how to thank you, man,
what a wonderful woman!

I had fun 48 hours non-stop!

Since we left the restaurant!

I took her home just now.
She was wasted, man!

You called me here just to say that?

I had to share it with you!
You have no idea how I feel good!

Jorge, nobody can stop me!
I'm a new man! A champion!

The English disembarked
at Malvinas!

I can't stand this place's bad mood!

That's why I wanted to come so early.
Delivery starts early...

at 9 a.m. And don't stop until
the last hour, at night.

What a woman, man.

You know how many times we did?
No.

Two?
This girl has something especial.

What about you, man? You put on
a long face all night...

Something wrong with Laura?
No, no, I don't know, I was...

...a bit tense, in fact...
Marita is right.

You're a sucker.
Marita?

The girl I introduced you to
said I'm a sucker?

See? It might not look like,
but she's smart, huh?

Do something, Jorgito. Get together
with Laura, face to face...

and have a good talk.
She'll thank you.

Should I start?
Please.

Well, I thought a lot
about the two of us...

and I think we have
to make changes.

We can't keep on going like this.

We're going through a moment...

that...

I had planned what to say
so carefully and now...

Well...
That's okay.

It's not usual for the
woman to mention this...

but I need to have some duties in
the relationship and I think that...

to push, to make you enter areas
you wouldn't enter by yourself...

Laura.

0kay.

Well, I think
we should try to continue.

You know that when
I set my mind to something...

So, I'll do like in the movies.
Will you marry me?

So.
The point is...

I agree that we're going
through a rough moment.

But what you just suggested
shouldn't be dealt with so lightly.

We've been together for a year.
Precisely.

It's a big decision.

And things are so out of context...
But you're going to think, aren't you?

<i>Of course I would think.</i>
<i>On one hand she was a beautiful...</i>

<i>honest and affectionate woman</i>
<i>willing to use each second...</i>

<i>of her life to make me</i>
<i>a superior man.</i>

<i>On the other hand, a cold home,</i>
<i>empty relationships, all the same.</i>

<i>How could I not think about it?</i>

<i>But I really didn't.</i>

Yes? Who is it?
Just a minute.

For you.

Who is it?
A friend.

Wait, I'm coming right way.

If she's the other, you can stay.

If I'm the other, you have to go.

"S"

Let me speak!

"U"

Listen to me!

"C"

Calm down!

"K"

Laura! Let me...

"E"

Hand me the bag! Hand me the bag!

"R"

What's on your mind,
Pellegrini?

What? You look gorgeous.

<i>Giddy up, Radicals!</i>
<i>Giddy up non-stop!</i>

0pen way! Just won and
are already arrogant!

A bright future stands ahead of us.
You're so bitter.

I brought you a present,
let's smoke the peace pipe!

Stop pulling my leg!

For you.

You better put it on yourself,
I might poke your eye with my finger!

So pretty!
What's that?

Napkins so you can distribute it
among the party people.

Enjoy the moment, after people see
the stupid things they're gonna do...

next election is ours.

If you ever come back to power,
I'll eat a chicken. Alive.

What are you doing?
I brought you a short story.

<i>And so democracy was back again.</i>

<i>A young democracy, a beautiful</i>
<i>and virginal democracy...</i>

<i>and if it's young, beautiful and</i>
<i>virgin, it better beware of us.</i>

<i>It was a time of passion and joy.</i>

<i>I disappeared for two years,</i>
<i>just working...</i>

<i>and accomplished an old target.</i>

<i>In June of 1985,</i>
<i>I had outdone Dostoievski...</i>

<i>in number of written pages.</i>

<i>But there was a short story</i>
<i>I couldn't write...</i>

<i>There was something missing,</i>
<i>a thread, an image...</i>

Very good.

Very good, Sebi, really.
You could get yourself into that.

You can get a job here, for sure.

He was embarrassed to think
you'd be seeing them.

You think so?
These are just scribbles, I can...

But if you're good,
they can ruin your style.

I know what I'm saying.
High spirits!

Jorge, why don't you help me?
Yes, sure.

To Alfredo Mastronardi...

a great fighter in the dark times.
From colleagues and friends.

I was very small when
my dad died, I didn't know much.

But mom told me how you
loved him and supported him...

You did everything you could...

to make sure he was fine.

I think that's a lot,
my father would've not accepted it.

He would've wanted
to share it with you.

So this is for you too.

Right, dad?

People are being sacked.
The magazine is not selling.

It became a symbol of dictatorship.
The tribute was to clarify that.

They don't know what to do to
be set apart from the dictators.

That's why they need room
for the young generation...

to the young people, you see?

Rock and stuff. Things the
young people like, you know?

And who is in charge now? Micky!
24 years old, look at that boy!

What about you?
Can I have a cigarette?

They made me editor-in-chief.
No kidding!

That's great!
No wonder you were so happy!

I hope you'll be happy too
with what I have to say.

Guess who is the new movies
and theater reviewer?

Who?
Jorge Pellegrini.

Why?
I can't do that anymore...

and you're going to do it better
than me, creativity is your turf.

Roberto, I'm not a reviewer.

Furthermore,
I like writing my own stuff.

But we'll be paying you
a great salary, every month.

What do you mean, "we'll be paying"?

Were you promoted
or you became an associate?

Look...

Well, I thought that...

by receiving some money
every month you could...

you would have time to...

write other things...
a novel... I don't know, man!

Did anything happen?

They won't publish the
short stories any longer.

I swear I fought for you, Jorge.
But it didn't work.

It's a new way of looking at things,
see? Nothing personal...

They want more current affairs
and less...

less short stories.
It sounds like a joke.

And they picked you
to tell me that.

No...

No, I asked them...

to tell you because...

In fact you make me feel...

I don't know, man. I got you a job
as reviewer, what else can I do?

Pay the bill.

What? Wait, wait...

I'll be right back.
Don't be a sucker, Jorge!

Me, a sucker?
People who can't even read...

get to be chiefs and are incapable
of having their own opinion.

It's the new reengineering.
People want to se something else.

After they raised your salary,
you even know what people want.

You're just like them, Roberto.
Everything's changed...

and your short stories are all the
same: A girl with 2 boyfriends.

Who cares? Not even you.

Let me go!
I offered you a good job...

Think about it, man. Do something
else, look for a new theme.

All right, I'm the reviewer.
Now I accept, now I resign!

And you, this work, and the
magazine can all go to hell.

Son of a gun!

<i>Laura was right, after all. In that</i>
<i>shitty magazine, they just...</i>

<i>drained me out. Mastronardi's story</i>
<i>then simply came out...</i>

<i>through the power</i>
<i>of hatred and anger.</i>

<i>A journalist who died of sadness</i>
<i>because of his friends' betrayal...</i>

<i>comes back from death</i>
<i>to settle a score with them.</i>

<i>I couldn't stop writing.</i>
<i>My fingers jumped.</i>

<i>After years crossing pages out,</i>
<i>I began reading what I'd written...</i>

<i>as it was in the beginning,</i>
<i>when I enjoyed that.</i>

<i>As it's today, for I had</i>
<i>something to say.</i>

<i>If nobody wants to read me...</i>

<i>they'll end up listening to me.</i>

A bit forward.
All right.

That cloud is awful, see if
there's anything you can do.

Sorry, Julio,
I have a problem.

I know you're the director and as
author, I don't like meddling in.

Very good.
But as producer...

I don't like the way you're
dealing with the dream sequence.

Why? Is it too expensive?

No, because you've been
using a naturalist code...

and I think the ghostly specter
shouldn't be so grand.

Ghosts don't speak that way.
Yeah? And how does a ghost speak?

Like when he was alive.

I don't mean to compare,
but do you know Hamlet?

I didn't have the pleasure.
0kay.

Let me see what I can do with that.

Come here!

<i>Shakespeare! Shakespeare!</i>

<i>How many sins have been</i>
<i>committed in your name!</i>

<i>Well, it was not Hamlet...</i>

<i>but "Up In Heaven" was the</i>
<i>best thing I'd written in life.</i>

<i>I gave up everything to do it...</i>

<i>even one of the things</i>
<i>I cherished most...</i>

<i>the friendship I had with Javier,</i>
<i>the guy who bought my car.</i>

<i>After 6 months of hard work,</i>
<i>discussions, sleepless nights...</i>

<i>there came the moment of reward.</i>

R00M 3 - "UP IN HEAVEN"
BY J0RGE PELLEGRINI

Did you like it or not?
Congratulations. It's awesome!

See you tomorrow.
0K, I don't want to be obliging.

There's something you didn't like,
there are so many known characters...

The famous "paint your village".
Didn't need to paint it with shit.

Márquez...
Let's have dinner, Antonio...

Don't be silly...
Enjoy the premiere.

Look, there comes one.
He went away.

Let's walk to the corner...
So, how was it?

I don't know,
I got a bit confused.

I have to watch it again.
0f course.

Well...

Go buy me a pack of cigarettes.
And the money?

Say something, please.

I don't know, I have to
think about it a while.

I did it for "Mastro".
No, you didn't.

You did it for you.

I want to thank you for thinking
of Alfredo, but he wasn't like that.

He was sad, he was angry,
but he was not resentful.

Who gives a damn about who goes to
heaven? Ibsen would've been better.

Who gives a damn about Norway?
Who gives a damn about anything?

Nine people, let's do it?
Sorry, we had agreed on ten.

What's the difference?
0ne more, what's the difference?

We said 9, there are 8,
why not 7?

We've reduced too much already.
Enough! Enough.

I'm out!
They're the ones who take the body.

What if we say we
have technical problems?

We have no technical problems,
but nine people who want to see it.

Jorge, this play is too dense,
and we haven't seen a nickel.

I'll talk to them.

There's no one else in there?

Jorge, let's go out to eat?

<i>In our trip into outer space...</i>

<i>we see the Constellation</i>
<i>of Orion, the Hunter.</i>

<i>His belt, popularly known</i>
<i>as the Three Marys...</i>

<i>is the most famous star formation</i>
<i>in our continent.</i>

<i>The beauty of our firmament...</i>

<i>can only be appreciated</i>
<i>in this planetarium...</i>

<i>since the city artificial lights</i>
<i>eclipse this natural spectacle.</i>

What about that bright star?
Nicolás?

What?
Are you playing anything?

<i>Just a second, sorry, this star</i>
<i>is not in our catalogue.</i>

<i>I'll consult with our director.</i>

Come on, they don't know my star?

Such a mess,
this country never changes.

How are you?

Here I am. And you?

Here I am.
Is it true the play was a failure?

No, that's not true.

Well, yes, it was a failure.
Who told you that?

The guy who bought your car.
The wheel broke down...

in a trip to Mar del Plata.
He's still cursing you.

You're kidding me.
0f course!

I saw the play.
And?

I loved it. It was very good.
Thank you.

Where can I find you, "Mastro"?

Why? Do you want to join me?

Stay where you are.

There are other things for you
to worry about...

like what you're going to do
with your life.

Now I'm broke,
I must find a job.

A piece of advice?
Do whatever pleases you.

You're telling me this shit?
What did you expect?

Get a cheap ticket, fall asleep...

and solve your life with a dream?

Don't smoke, don't run
and do whatever you like.

You'll live longer and better.
Listen to a dead man.

Well, I expected a bit more.

I also expected a bit more, Jorge.

But I'm not here
to give you advice.

I wanted to ask you a favor.
Anything you want.

Keep an eye on Sebastián,
take care of him.

<i>And that's the end of our trip.</i>

I'm hungry, let's eat.

Why is Shakespeare a genius?
His words.

Why do I have to accept
a bunch of swindlers...

who put a mute play on Shakespeare?

Seriously. They spit, hit, jump...

0f course I want to yell at them.

At least they're doing
something different.

What can you say?
You left in the first act!

0f course, it's insane!
The audience does half the work.

They should charge half too.
Yes.

Jorge, you don't like anything.
You criticize everybody.

You're too young,
haven't seen much.

I'm not to blame if 85% of
the things I see is trash.

My job is to tell the truth.
Your theater reviews...

made a lot of people read books.

Sausage?
Yes.

Excuse me. I need some room,
I hope you like it.

The pasta is my grandma's recipe,
the stuffing is my mother's...

but burning it in the oven
is a recipe of my own.

Don't worry, my love, I want you.

Enough of promises. Do it!
My love!

Cutie, cutie!
My handsome!

How two goofies like you can
get along so fine?

You're faking.
We get along very well.

I'll be sudden so you won't get
shocked. We're getting married.

No way! Congratulations!

Congratulations!
Thank you.

Wonderful.
Thank you.

That's lovely.

You heard I'm getting married?

Yes.

Have you thought it over?
No, dummy. That's why I will.

Let me go get more meat.
It's wonderful. Really.

What about you, guys?
We? No.

We? We don't want to hurry...

I still have many subjects to take
at college, and that's something...

you got to think hard, right?
You can't let your emotions rule!

Sure.

If you're spending your life with
someone, you can't rely on emotion.

Come on, everybody is
getting married, even Laura.

Girl, you're grounded.
5 minutes of shame.

Why? You didn't get
the invitation?

No. Against who is she marrying?

Someone she used to date.
Esteban, remember?

Yes. It seems he finally called.

People repeat stories.
Such suckers, huh?

Who is Laura?
A friend...

It's been a while since we last
saw her, I don't think we'll go.

If you're not going tell me in
advance so I can find a escort.

Marita? Should we get the
ice cream out of the freezer?

What for?
So it will soften a little.

You'd rather have known from Laura?
No, no, no...

I was thinking of you.

Hope has triumphed over experience.

Let me tell you something.

I don't know what comes upon
me with this woman.

I can't explain.

She laughs at the same jokes.
We like the same things.

Sometimes I have my doubts,
I feel insecure...

especially when I look at you.

I envy you! 0n a good way,
of course, you're my best friend.

I don't know, you have
this teenage thing...

always after something new.
And that makes me feel...

uncertain, unsettled, but then
I look into myself...

and see someone else.

I'm more of a family man,
I like being at home...

Well, so here I go.

J0URNALIST KILLS HIS EX-L0VER

Laura!

Laura!

I can't believe it!

Jorge...

I really can't believe it!
What a surprise!

What a coincidence!

Are you all right?
Yes, sure, why?

You're sweating.
It's the heat...

I owe you an apology for that
one time at the theater...

I don't know,
I wasn't feeling well...

Don't worry, really.
We're here now.

It's true. I can't believe it!
How are you?

I'm getting married, did you know?
0f course...

I'm the only one
you didn't invite.

<i>Sometimes I think that</i>
<i>the unimportant talks...</i>

<i>at unimportant places...</i>

<i>were the most important</i>
<i>moments of my life.</i>

<i>Since not much had been happening</i>
<i>in my life, I could...</i>

<i>put her up to date</i>
<i>between two stations.</i>

You know I still keep your short
stories? All of them corrected.

I tell you, it could be a book.
Let's not get into that again.

Let's talk about you, okay?

Imagine my surprise.

I get out of the radio one day and
Esteban's there at the front desk.

And what did he say?
"Hello, Laura".

No, really, what did he say?
Nothing.

Nothing? Was he in a hospital?
Coma, amnesia, said nothing at all?

Well, yes.

He went from Montevideo to Paris
in search of his destiny...

And that's it.
Watch out for the poop...

He came back in 1985.

So the guy disappears for 5 years...

comes back, sees you
and says "Hello, Laura"...

No, it wasn't so simple.

He was down on his knees
for one year.

Unbelievable. That's destiny.
After all...

See?
Yeah...

And I went on experimenting.
I experimented, experimented...

Really? You experimented a lot?
That's me.

Your boyfriend teaches here?

No, I'm taking a course on graphic
design. He doesn't paint anymore.

What?
Has Picasso abandoned his brush?

That deserves a toast.

Why did he stop painting?
Didn't he do so well in Paris?

The problem is that the
paintings' circle is a mafia.

Horrible.
The paintings too?

There are no good circles left.

But he still uses the same
strength on other things.

Like what?
Imports and exports.

Look, it's not the kind of
relationship we had together...

In fact...

things with Esteban
are so much calmer.

He respects my job,
respects my life, I respect him...

Well, I don't know.

I used to think that our thing,
our fire, was love.

But now I see it wasn't,
that it was just fire...

it gets you burnt and nothing else.

Now I see love
is something else...

that has to do with affection,
commitment, with sharing things...

with feeling safe and trust.

With trust.

That is love.

Not that teenage thing
of Romeo and Juliet...

I don't fall for that anymore,
a short story or a portrait.

And you know that when
I set my mind to something...

Laura...

Laura!

Laura! Laura!

Jorge, are you crazy?
What do you mean, crazy?

Where are you going?
We can't, it's wrong!

What's wrong?

You're naked, go home,
don't make a fuss!

No, I won't go home without you.

Are you mad? I'm getting married!
What about today?

That was nothing, a stupid mistake!
No, you know I love you.

No, I don't know, I don't care.
I haven't seen you in 5 years...

I'm involved with someone else...
I'm so stupid.

You're not in love, Laura.
I'm fine!

I'm at ease, I feel safe,
today was plain stupid. Taxi!

No, no! Taxi, no!
It was beautiful, but stupid.

Laura... you're not...
I'm so foolish...

You're not in love!

I'm not in love with you either!

And I trust him.

Get inside, you'll catch a cold.

Stag party?

Yes.

<i>I don't really think...</i>

<i>that the agribusiness producers...</i>

<i>are behaving like that!</i>

<i>- It's those who, scared to death...</i>
Yes, sir!

<i>... have kept quiet when they came!</i>
Go to hell!

<i>- Those who stand for dictatorship!</i>
Just bitter...

<i>Long live our nation!</i>

<i>Long live Dr. Carlos Saul Menem!</i>

Márquez...
What?

Eat this.

Eat, eat!
No way!

Eat, Márquez!

You promised! Come on!
Stop pissing me off!

Eat!

THE 90s

Jorgito!

How are you?

How are you, Manlio?
Fine.

Long time no see. I'm so glad to see
you. You look the same, the same!

I called you, did they tell you?
Many times, at your office.

You have no idea how happy I was...

when I found out you were
the reviewer of "Things".

I looked for you at the exit,
but didn't see you...

It was a great time for you,
I didn't want to spoil.

You have no idea how nervous I was.
I put 4 years of my life in that!

To deal with multimedia is like...

I don't know, like a kind of
exacerbated "big-bang".

A huge mess, you bother everybody,
your friends, your family...

They lend you even what they don't
have to help you. What can I say?

Tell me about you. You. How did
you like the play? Tell me.

You know that your opinion
is very important to me. I mean it.

That's why I wanted
to see you in private.

I won't publish the review.
I didn't like the play. Nothing.

Well, you are entitled
to your opinion, definitely.

But you could be more specific,
I don't know...

It's too childish.

All that fuss you
put up to speak of...

"speak", to yell,
I found very pretentious.

And all that huge mess with
videos, pictures, actors...

It was impossible to understand.

I'm sorry for being so rough, but...

I rather offer you some
constructive criticism than lie.

Sure, I appreciate that, I really
thank you for your honesty...

but when can I see some
"constructive criticism"?

No.

I appreciate the effort you've put
on something with so little...

commercial appeal.

I like that, it's refreshing.

I'm also aware that I can help you
with my review in the magazine.

We've put even what we
don't have in this project.

Sure.

How much did you spend?
US$ 8 thousand.

A fortune.

A fortune.

So I think you won't feel
bad about putting US$ 500 more...

I mean, it's not a delusion.

Think about it.

With 50 tickets that a good review
helps to bring in, and you're even.

It's also important to get a head
start with a favorable review...

it's always luring, always.

Well, let me...

talk to my associates,
it's a group project.

0f course, of course.
But make use of discretion.

0therwise, if the thing is aired,
the review will have no effect.

Want to drink something? 0n me.
No...

Thank you.
I have to get back to rehearsals...

Good, very good. The better
the play, the better the review.

Well, I'll call you at your office.

No, call me...

Call me... on my cell phone.

Here. It's best on the cell phone.
Cell phone?

You got a cell phone?
Well, I'll call you.

Thank you...
Not at all.

Thanks.
Bye.

Bye.

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine!

Good luck! Good luck!

I got it! I got it!

Let it be, she'll never find
another sucker like you.

I'll get drunk tonight.
Long live the newlywed!

Thank you, Roberto!
He's a pain in the ass!

Long live the grooms!

And the brides too!

You must think I'm an idiot,
but I'm overwhelmed!

No, why?
You look so beautiful.

Thank you.

Come and get your wife,
or I'll steal her from you!

You're far from being
the kind of guy she likes.

Who would say so?
How are you, Mr. Suárez?

Come on, I came to congratulate them
and you embarrass me! Come on.

I've always treated the
assistant director as "mister".

Congratulations, Márquez.
Thank you, boy.

A drink? They let you drink, right?
Well, I want some.

Sorry, I'll be right back.

Go ahead, go ahead.

Jorge, are you bored?

No, just a little tired, that's all.
Plus I had a few drinks too.

Where's your girlfriend?
No girlfriend. That's much better.

You know why you like me so?

And why I like you even more?

Because we never felt any sexual
attraction for each other. Zero.

Quiet, please! Quiet!

As best man, I'd like
to say a few words...

Hello? Manlio?

I'd like to congratulate
Leti and Antonio on this...

and tell them the second wedding
is even better, right, my love?

That stupid phone made me forget
what I was to say! Music, maestro!

Don't call me at the office,
Don't call me at the office!

I'll go by the theater. See you.

What? What is it?

What about this foot?
This tiny little foot?

What a surprise!
So you came!

I can't believe it!

I can't believe it! I told Manlio
I'd meet him here. Remember him?

The director of short
films shot on Super-8?

We set to meet here and look!
Such a coincidence, I can't believe!

You look gorgeous! Gorgeous!

It's the good life.

Very well, very well.

We have to talk.
Sure...

Want to have a coffee?

No...

I'm one of the producers
for Manlio's play.

Well, "producers"...
I put some money in it.

Manlio told me what
you wanted from him.

I called him a liar.

What is it, my love?

Here, get your pacifier. Here.

Here's what you asked for.
Count it, if you want.

No.

No, I don't want it.
I'll help him anyway.

Hello, my dear, come to daddy.

Hello, my daughter, hello, hello.

Isn't she my spitting image?
No, she looks like her father.

This child is so beautiful!
A toast! A toast!

To Violeta Márquez...

so that she can learn to forgive us
for the world we left for her.

So she can try to change it
if she's got the time; and so that...

she learns nothing,
absolutely nothing from us.

You made us cry.
What is it, Márquez?

Are you babysitting now?
Yes...

...the salary can't pay a thing!
Is she your granddaughter?

No, no, she's my daughter.

Violeta Márquez, Micky. Micky,
Violeta Márquez. Give him a glass.

Here's your article about the
protest against the economic plan.

It won't be published, ok? I need
the space for Perales...

...and that dancer. What's her name?
Wait, Micky, wait.

I'm a political journalist
and this is gossip...

dishing the dirt,
chitchat, celebrities...

As far as I know, Perales is senator.
Senator is politics, not gossip.

He's a celebrity.
Three pages and hurry.

Listen, boy!

Hold her a minute, please.
Sure.

Why don't you write it?

I'm sorry?

Write it yourself. Certainly you'll
do much better than me, of course.

You know what? This is your job,
not mine, Antonito.

"Antonito" like hell!
"Antonito", as you said...

is a political journalist...

"Antonito", you should know,
covered the Fall of Saigon...

covered a genocide, covered war
against two major powers.

A war against two
major world powers...

he was there when
dictatorship ended...

he was there when democracy arrived,
saw military mutinies, 400 ministers.

And now you want "Antonito"
to write silly things...

about an old man and a courtesan.

That's 0K, Micky, I'll do it...
No, no. Not you!

You're also a journalist!
Are you drunk, Márquez?

Who gives a damn about what
a senator does in Congress?

Had a sudden attack of dignity?
No!

Dignity doesn't come in attacks,
either you have it or don't, sucker!

Don't call me sucker!
Sucker! Sucker!

Let me explain something:
It's my duty to tell the truth.

Listen to Márquez!
He owns the truth, poor idealist...

Tell me: When in hell
you said the truth?

Always!
You're a liar, a stupid...

...and always kept your mouth shut!
Antonio Márquez...

does not lie!
He lies to no one!

To no one!

This trash, the battle for
"Pimpolho", I won't write ever more.

Let it be written by a sucker
like you, not me!

I'll tell what, Márquez:
You're fired.

Let's see how you're going to
feed your daughter Violeta...

Poop! That's what I'm going to eat!
I'll start right away, look...

Antonio, stop that, stop...

A bit oily, but tasty,
have some...

Stop, stop that, enough...
Try some, try it...

Stop, stop, enough, man!
Stop this old man! He is crazy!

It makes your bowels work well!
Eat! Eat!

It's for the bowels! It’ll make
you grow up! Eat, you son of a gun!

Let me go!

You stupid son of a bitch!

Are you taking this?
No.

Don't you feel ashamed?

Don't you feel ashamed?

Márquez!

"S0LITARY R0SE"
BY J0RGE PELLEGRINI

Your mother called me.
She's very worried.

You're burning your drawings.

And my short stories too.

You did nothing for my father.

Did you?

No.

It was a very tough time, Seba.
There was no way out...

Quit that "tough time" bullshit.
I'm talking about my dad.

Why didn't you do anything?

It seems the living suffer more
than the dead, after all.

No.

Not your drawings.

No. I shouldn't do this.

I shouldn't do it...

I've done it.

Hello? Roberto?

You won't screw me anymore.
No, nothing.

Is it closing? For me too!

Let me have the central page,
you're going to love it.

Good luck with Marito, you idiot.

<i>Bad luck! They'll give me money but</i>
<i>I can't use because it's damned?</i>

<i>Yes! It’ll bring bad luck</i>
<i>to the first man who touches it!</i>

<i>Second prophecy says:</i>
<i>There'll come a beautiful woman.</i>

<i>She'll come looking for you and will</i>
<i>ask you to stroll on the sidewalk.</i>

<i>- Just follow her!</i>
<i>- No, don't touch her!</i>

Why? No!

No, Jorge, no!

Hold her! Hold her!

No, Jorge!

Jorge! Jorge!

<i>I have to admit my imagination</i>
<i>is "too Italian"...</i>

<i>I can't deny.</i>

0pen it!
<i>- It was a narrow escape.</i>

<i>Roberto, worried with my phone call,</i>
<i>the same killjoy as ever...</i>

<i>came up to my house, put the door</i>
<i>down and rescued me in time.</i>

<i>Just like a prince.</i>

<i>Of course, he paid for the door.</i>

Throw up!

How are you, Antonio?
Is Jorge feeling better?

What is it now?
You'll know in a minute.

Tell me, how is the search coming?
Difficult.

If I keep like this, I'll have to
apologize before that stupid penguin.

Shit!

I'm glad you came, come in,
hurry! Go, go!

Surprise!

What a bunch of patsies!

Dear Márquez...

the 12 remaining clerks
of the magazine "Things"...

like apostles, puzzled...
wait a minute...

before the crucified Christ...

have decided to join in some savings!

A 12th part of our miserable
salary until you find a job!

From the bottom of our hearts...
We hope you can get a job soon.

Don't get lazy!

Come on, let's drink,
the magazine is paying...

You gave such a joy not showing
your face everyday anymore.

Nice, huh?
Márquez, getting out...

Jorge, look who's here.

I invited her because
she wanted to see you.

Well, feel at home.
I need to go to the bathroom.

We've known each other for so long,
still have nothing to talk about?

What's on your mind?
Nothing.

How can you not think of nothing?

Just practice.

You're drunk!
No, not drunk...

A bit high.

You should take care of yourself,
after what you've been through.

You know about it?

These guys.

But you're fine now.
Sure, yes, I'm good.

It was just a common and
stupid suicide attempt...

nothing so serious as
to slice my wrists off.

What about you?
What?

How is everything?
What's it like...

to be mother and wife?

Well, I'm a mother, alright.
But we broke apart.

Sorry, I didn't know.
That's 0K.

Things had already gotten bad
before the baby was born, so...

That's how we learn.

No, we don't really learn anything.

I saw your son so briefly but I found
him beautiful. What's his name?

Jorge!
No!

Don't be silly,
how could I name him Jorge?

His name's Gonzalo.

Laura, the last time
I saw you, I got so...

I'd rather not talk
about that last time.

Marita told me this surprise
to Márquez was your idea.

That's really good.

We better get out of here.
Yes.

Why? You don't like the rain
on your face anymore?

True. I had forgotten.

It's not going to rain.

Are you afraid?
No.

I'm a grown-up now.
Me too. That's why.

I said I didn't want to do
anything foolish, didn't I?

You also said you were not
in love and that was not important.

That the most important was affection
and respect. That love had burnt you.

I changed my mind.

Now I want something that
at least scorch me a little.

You don't?
Me?

I don't know.

I know nothing of that.
What do you mean?

What about the wonderful
stories you used to write?

They were trash, Laura, you were
the only one who liked them.

Love, heroism, passion...

Who said I could write
about things I don't know?

I should write about fear.

Fear...

I'm an expert on that.

I lost you out of fear.

0ut of fear I have a job I hate.

I let Mastronardi down,
I let his son down.

Sorry, I'm a bit sensitive today.

I always thought that everything
I'd touch would turn into gold.

Now look.

Everything I touch turns into shit.

Well...

That's not bad for a start.

What?

Write down my number.
Sure.

Wait.

Get in the car, come on.
Let's have some coffee.

You're getting soaked wet.
Get in the car...

I want you to call me.
I know.

"When you set your mind
to something..." Get in!

Laura!

I won't sleep tonight.

Me neither.

He's got a girlfriend!
He's got a girlfriend!

He's got a girlfriend!

What?
Drunk in a rain like this?

By the way, let's have a drink.

No, no, no. I have to look
for a job tomorrow...

which is much harder
than work hard.

I thought of a short story
to write tomorrow.

Got a happy ending?
0therwise, I won't publish it.

It'll be an epic, it starts
long ago, let's say, in 1980.

Be prepared for a shitty ending
with old fogey people!

We're getting soaked wet!

"THE SAME LOVE, THE SAME RAIN"
