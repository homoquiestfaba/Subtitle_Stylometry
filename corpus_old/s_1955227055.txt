You don't have to worry
about the end of the world

Because the end of
the world has come.

This is it.

We're in the last days.

There's no salvation for you.

You're just going to die.

[Music playing]

Who you were
hanging around with?

Nasty, bitter old
thing last night.

And somehow, he got her
to dance at the chamber

For the amateur night contest.

See, the way you win
one of these contests...

Is they get everybody
in the bar to spend

Money to tip the dance.

The girl at the end of the
night with the most money wins.

Now, Craig, he going
around, buying everybody

Drinks before they pay money.

And this ugly ass girl
loaded with his money.

Now the bouncer, his girlfriend
was in the contest, right?

His girl... I guess she... she
got it going on or something.

So, he had Craig's
girl disqualified.

Craig, drunk as hell,
yelling, it's fixed!

It's fixed!

What'd the bouncer do?

So the bouncer grabs Craig,
throws him at the bartender.

But look, home boy, he drives
his tight ass [inaudible].

The night the cop

Pisses all over the stairwell,
the radio, the seats.

All that stuff. [Inaudible]
blood everywhere.

Blood everywhere.

Then, he brings up
his little thing,

And he starts pissing
all over Craig.

It feels like
I'm having a baby.

Oh, shit.

Ah!

A what?

Oh my god.

I'm having a baby.

Oh my god!

You've gotta help me.

Oh, shit!

You've gotta-
you've gotta help me!

What do you mean me help you?

I don't know nothing
about no baby!

Get me... get me a towel!

And a knife.

[Grunting in pain]

Hey.

Hey, wake up.

Wake up.

You all right?

[Distorted baby sounds]

I didn't know you was pregnant.

Oh... oh my god.

Get rid of it.


Get rid of it.

Craig will kill me if
he sees that thing.

Oh my god.

Why?

Because we haven't
fucked in two years!

Get it out of here!

Ah... ah...

Well thanks a fucking
lot, T. What am I supposed

To do with a goddamn baby?

Get him out of here, bitch!

Get it out!



Look, Linda, why do we have
to have the same discussion

Over and over?

Because it's the wrong
time, that's why.

Look, if I can't devote 100% to
the Mandalay account right now,

Then they'll pass me
over for my promotion.

Linda... Linda, will you...
Will you calm down, please?

Ye... Yes, you know I want kids.

It's just the wrong time
right now, that's all.

Look... yes, look,
just... I... I gotta go.

I... I'm late for a meeting.

Yeah, don't wait up.

I gotta go.

[Music playing]

What can I get you?

A shot of Jack, please.

You got it.

[Club music playing]

Hi.

Hi.

This weather really sucks.

What?

The weather.

Oh, yeah.

Real sauna out there.

This shit any good?

Oh, it's good.


those hoes again?

My god!

Will you look at this bitch?

Yo, bitch!

What the fuck you think
you're doing here?

Oh, and I know you're not
bringing that stupid ass

Crack baby to my shit.

Can... can... can you take him?

Can I what?

Is this bitch for real?

Look, I'll give him
to you for an eighth.

An eighth?

What kind of shit is that?

Listen, bitch.

What the fuck would I need with
a stupid ass crack baby for?

Take a look around, bitch.

I don't need that
shit in my life.

I tell you what... you
bring him back, honey.

Yeah.

Bring him back when he's
old enough to suck my dick.

Now get yo' stupid ass out of
here before I change my mind

And bust a cap up your ass.

Get outta here!

Playing that shit!

On the TV!

The end, bitch!

[Club music playing]

I thought I told you not
to bother the customers.

The gentleman was
about to buy me

A martini, seeing as we both
have a thing about [inaudible].

Sure.

[Club music playing]

Honey, you look like
you got more on your mind

Than the heat.

Is there anything that
I could do to help?

No, I'm... I'm a married man.

Yeah.

Ah.

Oh, god.

[Baby crying]

Wha... what the
fuck are you doing?

[Baby crying]

Son of a bitch.

What?

What is it?

The baby.

A what?

It's a baby.

A baby in a cardboard box.

Oh my god.

It's a mother fucking baby.

Oh my fucking god.

Is that all you can say
is oh my fucking god?

What the fuck do
you want me to say?

It's a mother fucking baby.

I can see it's a baby.

Don't you think I can see that?

Shit.

Shit!

Fucking shit... that's
all I fucking need

Is a... a fucking baby
in a box in an alley.

Oh, you?

It's all that you need.

Shut up, look,
just shut up, OK?

Hey, don't tell me
to shut up, no one

Ever tells me to shut up.

I'm just trying to...

Oh!

What are you...


It's a baby in a cardboard box.

All right, all right.

Um, um... all right.

I mean, we gotta do something.

Pick it up.

What?

Pick it up.

Pick it up?

I'm not gonna pick it
up, you pick it up.

But you're a woman.

What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

I don't know anything
about babies.

We have to do something,
we can't just leave

It here in a fucking alley.

I don't know where you're
getting all this we stuff from,

But this doesn't have
anything to do with me.

Anything.

What do you mean this doesn't
have anything to do with you?

Like I said, it doesn't
have anything to do with me,

You're the one who found it.

Shit!

Look, OK, we'll take
it to the police.

How exactly are you going
to explain the two of us

In this alley?

What the fuck are
we going to do, then?

There isn't any
we, deal with it.

No, you're not going
anywhere until we figure out...

Get your motherfucking hands
off my motherfucking bitch!

Jimmy, I told you that I'm
going to get you your money,

But I'm not your bitch!

Shut up, bitch!

Hey, don't you
tell me to shut up!

Maybe you didn't hear me.

I said get your hands off
my motherfucking bitch!

Oh man, that's not necessary.

Are you talking to me?

Don't you ever talk to me.

You understand me?

I understand.

Motherfucker, shut up!


No, it's not what you think!

Shut up, bitch!

[Repeated groans]


You can call me a
bitch, motherfucker.

But don't tell me to shut up.

Ah, you'll live.

Jimmy never did know
how to use a knife.

Taxi!

Hi, give me a hand?

Got a bit much.

1724 South 24th Street.

Keep the change.

Hey, hold on!

This is his, too.

Can you pop the trunk?

[Trunk slams]

Thanks!

[Car radio blaring]

Rough night, Tetu?

Man bleed in car!

Two people want to ride
in the back the taxi?

Shasta, why?

Why all this?

This world is... you
know what I try to say,

I have to laugh
to keep from cry!

Don't get deep
now, Tetu, I gotta

Clean this shit up in the back.

No one is deep in our story,
Shasta, That is problem!

No one is deep.
It's all about me.

Give me, take, take.

Old Georgie gonna have
to clean this shit up,

Cause I ain't gonna
get paid for nothing

But seven dollars an hour!

That's ignorant
and irresponsible,

But I'm right on this.

It's all about me in the end.

Whatever.

Tetu, you fucked up freak.

I hardly think that comparing
the narrative structure

Of [inaudible] with
Linklater's brilliant Slackers

Deserves a passing grade.

Did you even read my idea?

What about The
Phantom of Liberty?

Miss Taylor, you might
find it to your advantage

To stick with the
films that have

Been painstakingly selected
for this semester's curriculum.

Well, what about Adrenaline?

I'll see you
Monday, Miss Taylor.

Emo!

Emo, Stop, asshole!

Miss Howard, must
you constantly

Try and disrupt my life?

It's been...

Look, it's been six months,
and we really need to talk!

Get over it.

I was going through
a rough time.

And don't tell me
that I tried to tell

You that there was anything
more to our little escapade.

What the fuck would
I want you for?

Look, don't flatter yourself,
I just need to talk to you.

Just give me five
minutes, five minutes

Out of your time and you won't
ever have to see me again.

Either will your wife!

Five minutes, no more.

No way.

No way, that's...

Don't turn away, look at him!

I said look at him!

You gonna tell me
that he doesn't

Look exactly fucking like you?

That's... that's not mine.

There's no way.

Look, believe what you want.

It's not your problem, anyway.

My God.

Why didn't you tell me?

Why the fuck do you think
I've been calling you, asshole?

Does Rose know?

No.

I can't believe this.

You're so young.

Why did you have it?

You piece of shit!

Your child is sitting
in front of you.

Look at him!

He's beautiful, and
he's a part of you!

At least before
you became so cold.

Are you still living
with your parents?

No.

They tossed me when
they found out.

Me and E are living
in the car for now.

E?

I thought he should
have his father's name.

But you're so cold,
I can't say it.

So I just call him
E. Look, I know

This is a lot for you deal with,
but we have nowhere else to go.

Do you think we could...

No way.

I mean, just until we
get back on our feet.

I mean, we have no money, and
we're living in a fucking car!

I'm trying to patch
things up with Rose.

This... this would kill her.

It would kill your chances
to get back with her.

Sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Yeah.

That's what my mom said
when dad kicked us out.

Have you had any place to...

No!

It's just me and E.

I... I know this won't
mean very much, but uh...

I can give you some money.

You know, so that you could
find a place to stay, till...


You know?

I guess a father
isn't an option, huh?

I can't, I just can't.

See that, E?

Our lives are only worth $3,000.

Rose will never know.

It's not her problem.

And it looks like it's
not gonna be yours.

Take care of yourself, Shasta.

I have E.

The two of you will...
Will do just fine.

There goes your
daddy, E. Well E,

It was nice doing
business with you!

I mean, come on, you got a
stroller out of the deal!

But don't let the government
take it from you, big man!

OK, take care!

[Wind blows]

[Car radio plays music]

Hello?

Hello, is somebody there?

[Car door slams]

What... what are you
doing here, little fella?

Is your mom around?

Hello?

Hello?

Are you all alone?

I don't see your mommy or
daddy around here anywhere.

Walter!

Walter!

Where the hell are you?

That... that's my
boss, little baby.

He... he isn't very nice, and he
doesn't like people very much.

I... I'll just leave you
here for a few minutes,

Until I get off work, and
then I'll come back for you.

OK?

Walter!

Er, coming, Mr. Pritchard!

Where the hell have
you been, Walter?

I've been calling
you for five minutes.

How long does it take to
empty the goddamn trash?

I'm real sorry,
Mr. Pritchard, sir.

It won't ever happen
again, Mr. Pritchard, sir.

You stupid retard.

If I had my way about it, you'd
be out of here on your ass!

But the head of the
goddamn handicapped program

Won't let me!

Get this mess cleaned up!

You've got two minutes, or else!

You pathetic piece of shit!

[Woozy music playing]

Whoa, I'm sorry, little
baby, are you cold?

We have to find you a blanket.

I'm sorry, little baby!

That's the landlord!

I'll be right back.

Hi, Walter.

What you doing?

Hi Carl, I was sleeping!

Yeah?

Sounds to me like you're
having a nightmare!

No, I'm OK!

Sounds like you have
some company, Walter.

Sounded kind of like
a cry of some kind?

No, there's nobody here!

Don't lie to us, Walter!

We can hear it through the wall!

You got a pet or something?

Hey, you can't do that!

This is my room!

You know you ain't supposed
to have any pets here, Walter!

No, I don't have any...

Not so fast, Walter!


What do we have here?

I'll be a son of a bitch!

It's a baby!

Now, what would you
be doing with a baby

In your dresser drawer, Walter?

You leave him alone!

He's mine, I found him!

Oh you found him?

Where do you find
a baby, Walter?

Where do you find a baby?

You kidnapping babies, Walter?

You... you put him down!

He... he's mine!

Ow!

You fucking bit me,
you fucking retard!

Son of a bitch bit me.

Now I'm gonna be a retard, too.

Don't you know
kidnapping is a crime?

I didn't kidnap him!

I found him!

People who kidnap
babies go to jail

For a long, long time, Walter!

Didn't we tell you
we was with the FBI?

The FBI, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

You're not with the FBI!

You're bad men!

We been watching you, Walter.

We been watching you real close.

Real close.

Looks like you're in
some trouble, Walter.

You two, get a room.

Now you just sit there real
quiet, and you won't get hurt.

We're going to take
your little tot

Into the bureau for questions.

An agent will be along,
you know, uh, to pick

You up, and bring you downtown!

Ha!


Yeah.

Sure.

You're really out there, man.

Agent Carl, Agent Mitch,
how can I be of service?

Oh, we may have something
of interest to you.

Mitch and I stumbled upon a
little treasure from heaven.

Heaven indeed.

What'd you rip off
the retard this time?

No retard bullshit today, boy.

No my friend.

We got something much bigger.

We're closed, beat it.

I said beat it!

You dabbling?

What's in here?

Yeah.

OK.

Faggot?

So, what would you say to this?

Carbon-based life form.

Where the fuck did
you steal this?

Nobody.

Yeah.

It's like, independent.

I snuck the spirits in here.

So, what do you
guys want for it?

Well, we know what you're in.

Name your price.

No problem.

We're also gonna need
some other things.

After all, it's [inaudible].

Aw, man!

This is it.

Come on.

And we'll take this, too.

Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

Oh dear.

Hey, wait!

Nothing.

All right.

Guess we'll see you around.

It was, uh, business
doing pleasure with you.

Yeah, business.

[Heavy guitar music playing]

[Woozy music playing]

I don't know how you
knew, but it's here.

OK.

I'm telling you,
Jed Tucker is back,

And I say this time
we finish the job.

And I'm telling you, there
ain't no job to finish!

Look, you can't
ignore the signs!

Been two years since Jed Tucker
was run off, and nothing!

Then all of a sudden
it starts up again!

Two children missing
in as many weeks!

And ol' Parker, he's seen
activity out at the cabin.

Lights and such!

Only people out
at that cabin are

Drifters looking
for a place to stay

On their way to someplace else!

Drifters ain't got
no need for lights!

I'm telling you,
Jed Tucker is back!

So Luke Walker sees
something, and Lord knows,

The way he drinks, that
ain't a rare occurence...

And we're supposed to go
out there with a rope,

And start hanging people?

Look, it's our moral
obligation to our children.

To stem the fear.

Or increase the paranoia.

Ain't that more likely it, Jim?

Face it, Jim!

Without the fear, all you got
here is a broken down building.

You have alienated the
people of this town

With your apocalyptic
rhetoric to the point nobody's

Listening anymore, Jim!

Apocalyptic rhetoric?

Our children are
being victimized,

And that's the best you can do?

Well if the rest of this
town is so apathetic,

I supposed the
burden falls to me!

Thought you'd never get here.

How did you know...

You are only a secondary
character, Mr. Dean.

Anyway, he is here...

Underwritten, undeveloped...
Your excuse to move

Us one point to another.

Just give it to me.

We agreed on a price.

I sacrificed...

I know what sacrifice you made!

Mr. Dean hasn't sinned.

Lucas is [inaudible].

No importance.

Look, I've had enough
of your spooky...

Mr. Dean.

You'll wake outside your
own inner perception.

Not exist!



[Music playing]

I don't think this
is such a good idea.

Yeah right, like you've
never been out here before.

Ha ha, very funny.

I'm serious, this
place scares me.


God!

You scared the shit out of me!

I'm sorry, come on,
I was just kidding!

No, I'm serious,
this place is creepy!

I 'm just kidding!

Hey, wait.

Make yourself useful?

Nelly, you gonna join me?

All right, now look.

Y'all be careful, cause
these are loaded, all right?

Especially you, Wiley!

And get rid of the
booze, will ya?

Don't expect a man to
freeze to death, do you?

Give me that!

I'm putting it away!

I'm putting it away!

With you all drunk like that,
someone's likely to get hurt!

Probably shoot himself.

Come on, let's go.

Probably shoot himself.


See anything you like?

Oh, I see two things I like.


Shit.

Wiley, come on!

Wiley!

I said, come on!

And watch where you're
pointing that damn gun!

Come on!

Wiley, come on.

Wiley, don't smoke, Wiley, watch
where you're pointing the gun.

They treat me like a
damn three year old.

JIM: Wiley, shut up!

Wiley, shut up.

Wiley don't do this,
Wiley don't do that.

See, I told you!

Just like I said.

He's got one in there right now!

Now settle down, Jim.

Let's not go running
off half cocked.

We don't know what he's got!

The hell we don't know!

You heard those screams
just as plain as I did.

You didn't hear any screams.

Shut up, Wiley!

Goddamn it, Sam.

Why'd you have to
bring him anyway?

He's all I could
get last minute!

We'd be better off without him!

Now look, we can't
be too careful.

Last time they brought in
Jed, he had a stockpile

Of arms in his place.

That is one crazy son
of a bitch, all right?

So we can't take any chances.

Now look, you're going
to go around to the left,

You're going to go
around back, Wiley, OK?

Now, I'm going to go over...

No!

Wiley.

Now Jim...

No!

Wiley, what the hell
are you talking about?

No, I'm... I said, I'm not going
to do what you say no more,

I'm not going!

You... you just can't stand
here and talk about a man

Like he wasn't here!

You just can't treat
people like that, Jim!

You...

Wiley, shut the hell up!

Oh!

That's what mama always said!

Wiley, he didn't mean anything!


Look, Wiley, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

OK?

I mean, it... it's just I... I'm
nervous and all, being here.

That's all it is.

Are we all right, Wiley?

All right.

We're all right?

OK, we're all right.

All right, I'll tell you
what we're going to do.

You're going to go
around the left.

Wiley, you're just gonna stay
here and watch the front.

You OK with that?

Mmm.

All right, OK, let's go!

Jim?

What, Wiley?

Oh, nothing.

All right, let's go!

[Tense music playing]


Holy Christ, Jim!

What happened?

It's Jed Turner!

He attacked me,
but I-I shot him!


Son of a bitch got away!

Wiley, he ran right past you!

Why didn't you stop him?

He ran right past you!

It wasn't no man!

Wiley, you son of a bitch!

Sam, you saw!

You saw!


[Whispery night noises]

Creepy-looking place.

Oh, shit.

Fuck this place.

I say let's go to the river.

You got gas money?

No.

Man, this place
ain't Alice Lane.

I'm... I'm in for the river.

I say we go to the river.

Alice Lane?

Yeah.

There's this road down by
the sewage treatment plant

Called Alice Lane.

Yeah man, this chick Alice?

She lived on the road, right?

And one night this psycho...

One night this psycho
breaks into her house.

Was she hot?

Man, she was like,
80 or something.

No, no she was 12.

Her parents left her alone while
they went to a dinner party.

Well anyway, this psycho
breaks in dressed like a clown,

Rapes her, cuts her
up, and hangs her limbs

All along the trees,
along the road.

Bullshit.

No, I'm fucking serious.

How come I never
heard about it?

Some nights you can see an arm
and a leg hanging from a tree.

Yeah man, last fall after the
game, we were tripping, right?

And we drove down the road.

And damn if there wasn't a
leg hanging from the tree!

Bullshit!

I shit you not!

Fucking leg hanging from a tree.

Blood even dripped
on the windshield.

Hell yeah.

So what the fuck did you do?

Got the fuck outta there!

No shit, man!

In Statesboro, where
my cousin lives,

They got these ghost lights.

What the fuck is that?

Ghost light!

It's this old confederate
railroad track,

And these lights appear.

When you get close to 'em, they
start moving away from you.

How the fuck do they
have lights on a train

During the Civil War?

Don't be a fag.

Oil?

I don't know.

I don't believe it, anyway.

So what's the deal
with this creepy place?

My dad told me that
back in the 70s,

This place belonged to
this child rapist guy

Named Jed Turner or something.

He snatched like 15 kids,
brought 'em out here,

And in that house, he would
rip out their spinal cords...

Man, here, cannonball it, man!

Anyway, this Jed guy
kidnapped a little girl

That belonged to that priest
down... that Baptist church

On Center street.

You mean that crazy...
That crazy minister

Who's always getting
arrested for all sorts

Of crazy witch hunt shit?

Reverend whatever.

Anyway, that's the one.

So this minister
goes nuts wanting

To come after this guy Jed,
but the cops get here first.

They catch the child raper?

Yeah.

And the only thing they find
of the minister's little girl

Is her spinal cord
hanging in the shack.

And this minister goes nuts!

Wanting to come here and burn
this place up, saying it's

Haunted and shit.

Everybody thinks
he's nuts, and he

Loses most of his congregation.

Damn!

And?

My dad swears this place
is haunted by the ghost

Of the kids the guy killed.

Nah.

You're full of shit,
and so's your old man.

Maybe, maybe not.

Nobody comes out
here anymore, though.

Not a bunch of... not
a bunch of bullshit

Like fucking ghost lights!

Ghost lights!

Yeah shit!
Right!

Ha!

Fuck you, you fucking
son of a bitch.

What's going on?

Are you afraid of ghost dick?

Man, fuck you!

Shit.

Smells like a man has been here.

Maybe the child rapist is back!

Boo!

Ha ha!

I'm gonna take a piss.

Oh shit!

[Interposing voices]

Hey, nice decor.

Ha.

Think I should pee on it?

Gotta pee on something.

Look.

Nice interior design.

[Interposing voices]

What the fuck is that?

What?

Don't joke for a
second, will ya?

[Low noise]

That!

You hear it?

It's coming from right there.

Holy shit!

Oh my God!

Freaking baby... who the
fuck put a kid in there?

Son of a...

I'm tripping my
fucking balls off.

Hey, check his head, man.

Huh?

Check his head!

Why?

I bet there's a 666 on it.

Yeah!

Shh!

No, but there's a third eye.

Let's get out of here.

You really think we should
take that thing with us?

Yeah man, I wonder if he's
gonna come back looking for it?

Oh man, don't be such a pussy.

Let's just go to the river.

Hell yeah, 'bout damn time!

[Rock music playing]

So uh, Matt, uh, now
that you're a dad,

Can I borrow five bucks?

So what do you want with
a voodoo zombie baby?

MATT: Ain't my kid!

That sounds familiar!

Shut up!

I kinda feel sorry for it.

I mean, what does this kid
have to look forward to?

I mean, shit!

My old man's bad enough,
but this kid ain't got dick!

Your dad's all right.

You just say he sucks cause
all kids say that shit.

You know what sucks is this!

This fucking world, man!

Fucking people ditching babies!

Cops busting people!

Fucking nuclear bombs!

Fucking bullshit world!

Dumbass!

You're here, I mean... what does
he gotta go through you don't?

That's the point.

I gotta live it.

And I can't fucking take it.
It's so fucking stupid!

I mean, OK, yeah,
this place sucks!

But we ain't always gotta stay.

turn the kid over to child

Welfare or social
security or something,

So they can take care of it.

Fuck that.

Jesus fuck.

Yeah, fucker,
crooked little bastard

In the ghost fucking house.

Get him back and kill him.


It would be stuck here like us!

Well we gotta do something.

Well, the only thing I have
to do is get me another beer.

This right here could be a
turning point in our lives.

This is a sign, man.

A sign?

Yeah.

What?

A sign from Meisterbrau.

Lisa had an abortion.

Took her to Augusta
last Wednesday.

She said it was mine,
but I don't know.

We hadn't done it in a while.

I didn't know.

Weird thing was
that she said she

Didn't know if she wanted it or
not, she said it was up to me.

I love her, but she
wouldn't tell me what to do.

Man.

You know?

Sorry, dude.

Yeah.

That's some heavy shit!

She won't talk to me now.

Man.

Things are
different, I can tell.

Oh man.

I think it's gonna be all right.

I mean, uh, hell, it might
not even have been yours.

I mean, you don't know!

This baby, man, it
tells me something else.

[Train approaching]


Matt, don't worry, man!

Yeah, this time you don't
have to make a decision.

Like Moses, Matt.

Ready?

Hit it.

[Rock music playing]

Wake up, you pussies!

The fuck you doing sleeping?

That's easy for
you to say, man.

Who was the first one who
passed out last night?

What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

I don't remember a damn thing.

I do know I have
a wicked hangover.

And I know last night was
some fucked up shit, too!

The only thing that was
fucked up about last night

Was you doing all three
hits of acid, asshole!

What?

Man, I don't what
you're talking about,

But you put the fucking
baby in the cooler...

What?

Man, you are hallucinating, man!

I mean, we had to sleep
on the hard ass ground

While you tripped
your brains out,

Cause you put your fucking
car keys in the cooler

And then threw it in the river!

Otherwise we would've
left your hallucinating

Ass sitting out here all alone!

All right, whose idea was it
to stay here and babysit him?

Man, fuck you guys!

I'm outta here!

Man, you must've had, like,
a wild fucking trip, man!

Should have seen yourself!

Hey man, I'm sorry about
that thing with Lisa.

It must have you
really stressed.

What about my car?

Get the baby to
help you push it!

Man, shut up, asshole!

FEMALE OFFICER:
Can you hurry up?

They stop serving at 10:30.

Hey you kids!

Come here.

You boys doing
out here so early?

You live around here?

Uh, no sir.

We live in town.

We were just camping
out by the river.

You guys come by
here last night?

Uh, yes sir.

See anything unusual?

No sir.

Time did you come
past here last night?

Oh um, I don't know,
uh, 11:30 maybe?

You didn't see anything?

Well...

No!

We didn't see anything.

Well what?

Well, there was this car
parked right over there.

Nobody was in it, I don't think.

Dammit!

Well, I'm not gonna lie!

You kids go wait by the car.

Shit.

Matt, I told you I didn't
want to talk to you anymore!

Lisa, come down here, I
have something to show you.

No, now go away before
you wake up my dad!

Lisa!

It's important!

Well, for you, it's
all just a game.

For me, it's life.

Funny our paths would cross.

Don't worry dude, someone will
be along to feed you soon.


Why should I have to
pay for these bleeding

Heart social programs?

Why?

They give them no
reason to work!

You know, we pay for everything.

Enterprise... abolish...
Waste of money...

Private education... yeah,
right... private enterprise...

Lisa, are you back?

Yes, mom.

[Knock on door]

Lisa!

You need to get downstairs and
help your mother with dinner!

Jackie's big game is tonight!

[Slow music playing]


When shall we three meet
again under the thunder,

Lightning and rain?

Shut the fuck up!

Check this shit out.

Hey.

I know that chick.

How's it going, Lisa?

Haven't seen you
around in a while.

Isn't your brother some jock?

I have three brothers!

Do they, uh, gang rape you?

So what's with the baby, Lisa?

You have a vaginal blood fart?

It's mine!

That's not what I heard.

I heard something else.

Do tell!

I heard you didn't have
a baby at all, Lisa.

Well, I did.

So who's the father?

None of your business!

Oh come on now.

You can tell me.

Just leave me alone, please!

Bitch!

Oh, there's the answer!

God, what a sketch...

Matt's kid, Lisa?

Fuck you!

Choke on your own blood, bitch!

Father Tom's weird.

What's that all about?

How's the baby doing?

Lisa, I'm sorry!

I didn't know what you wanted!

Last night I was... well,
I see things differently.

We can get married, we can
raise this child, I don't know!

But I'm willing to try!

I love you.

Lisa!

Dammit!

You need a ride, baby?

There ain't much room,
but the van's real cozy!

You can let the little one
ride up here if you want!

Thanks, but I'd like
to keep him with me.

Suit yourself.

Climb in.

Thanks.

So, where are you headed?

Anywhere.

I like that.

We're on our way to Florida.

There is nothing like
Christmas in the sun.

Me and Ron love Florida.

Yeah, they got one
hell of a scene!

Oh, roses on Christmas Eve!

Mhmm.

[Rock music playing]



Ron?

Stop talking, Lydia!

I can't come when you're...

Yeah, sure, my voice alone
can give you an erection.

Ah shit, Lydia, ruin my fun!

Well, when we get to Florida
you can get in on my time.

She is nice!

Gonna make a great slave!

It's OK, sweetie!

I know it seems bad now,
but you will love it.

Kind of like the first
time you have sex.

It don't feel good, not yet.

[Loud slam]

My baby...

Oh, it's gone!

We can't have a slave trying
to take care of some kid!

It ain't yours, no way!

I could tell, Lydia!

She is so tight!

It has nothing to do
with childbearing, Ron!

And just what were you trying
to do, choke her to death?

We want her alive.

She is a nice girl.

Maybe we should've just
asked her to begin with.

That's not how Jerry started
me out, and I loved him for it.

Fuck Jerry!

When Jerry first
abducted me, I hated him.

Would have killed him.

But that hate turned
into such love,

That I would do
anything to please him.

But Jerry didn't try to
kill me the first time!

He started out the
abuse nice and slow.

I know what I'm talking about.

I'm sorry I got so mad.

Don't apologize, Ron!

I really, really am...


Oh, shit!

Don't worry, she won't get far.

We'll have to punish
her for this behavior.

[Rock music playing]

[Incoherent yelling]

Ah!

Here!

All righty.

Ah!


Guess who's coming to dinner?

Oh, Randy, this will not do!

This will not do!

Oh Randy!

Oh!


Seen any good movies lately?

[Maniacal laughter]

No!

Stay!

They quickly rationalize
their action.

Ask Wade!


OK!

No!

Nobody!

No!


Someone heard screaming
on the other side.

Yo, is everything
all right there?

No!

Ah!

Down!

Get down!

I'm standing outside the
Blackshire Police Station.

Earlier this morning,
officers responded

To a call involving a
baby abandoned at the Gas

And Go truck stop off I-75.

When the officers arrived
on the scene, not only

Did they find an infant, but an
unidentified man in the truck

Stop restroom had apparently
cannibalized 21-year-old fry

Cook Derek Pagel.

Severed head found...
At least one officer...

This is WCP, Channel 16.

Did anybody get that?

Look, I can appreciate
your frustration.

If he doesn't give us
anything today, then... Randy!

You feeling chatty today?

Randy, tell us what happened
in the truck stop restroom.

How's it going in here?

Oh, I had to escort him.

What's up with you, Fax?

I don't know but I wish
they'd come something soon.

The kid's still here?

Yep.

You like comics?

What kinda comics?

Oh, I don't know.

Any comic books, really.

Sometimes.

I love comics.

Maybe you don't
understand how this works.

You see, we ask you a question.

You give us an answer, huh?

Come on.

What happened at the
truck stop restaurant?

Human unhappiness
is [inaudible]

If people have the ability
to control their soul, then


OK, smart guy!

I've had about enough
of your bullshit.

Do you like it?

That's it, pal!

Oh no, Randy.

I know what you're thinking!

Oh no, Randy!

You are...


Who the fuck are you?

What do you want?

What do you want?


[Wind whistling]

She's a real winner.

If you have not seen this
life, you ain't seen shit.

Not yet.

I've seen it all.

I was fucking cold as
the rest of the world.

Can't feel no more!

Guess it don't matter.

Can't feel my dick!

One cold fucker messes
someone up, you pass it on.

I don't care anymore!

Fuck!

They won.

I don't know what
fuels anything.

Got it figured out!

They're all dead!

Or should be.

I... I'm just a pawn on some
bitter artist's canvas!
