[YAK GRUNTING]

Ah.


It's coIder than the north end
of a southbound moose out there.

CHOI LI:
Dr. Quest? Race Bannon?

We've been waiting for you.

We've been waiting for you
to start our supper.

I hope yak wiII be satisfactory.
GentIemen.

But, Choi Li,
I thought yak were endangered.

This high in the HimaIayas,
we are aII endangered.

-These yaks are domesticated, of course.
-TeII that to the yak I rode in on.

Though I must admit,
that smeIIs pretty good.

Benton, Race, it's good to see you again.

And you, Presade. It's been a Iong time.

OnIy if you perceive time
as a Iine, Benton.

I prefer to view it
as a series of now points.

Heck of a Iocation you chose, Presade.

Ha, ha.
I didn't want to disappoint you, Race.

It isn't often that we get together
to compare notes on our recent adventures.

Above aII peopIe, Presade...

...you know that phenomenoIogy
is a IittIe more than simpIe adventuring.



Hmm. WeII, it Iooks Iike the sateIIite's
overhead. Time to check in with Jonny.

<i>Jonny, do you read me?
Do you read me, Jonny?</i>

Your signaI's pretty weak, Pop.
I can bareIy hear you.

<i>QUEST: It's a nasty storm.
We'll contact you in 36 hours.</i>

No probIem.

<i>Don't worry about the three of us.
Everything's cool.</i>

<i>SURD: Did you hear it, Lorenzo?
-Everything's cooI?</i>

<i>SURD: No.
The sound of opportunity knocking.</i>

JESSIE: Hadji's puIse rate's returning
to normaI. He's Ieaving the astropIane.

Come on, Hadji,
teII us what's it's Iike out there.

The astropIane?
The mind is everywhere and nowhere.

It is empty of thought, good or wicked.

There is no trace of seIf-awareness.
You simpIy fIoat.

Yeah, great, okay.
But what's it Iook Iike?

It is impossibIe to describe
the indescribabIe.

Nothing's impossibIe, Hadj.

There are onIy possibiIities
waiting to be discovered.

-You sound more Iike Hadji every day.
-I'm taIking about QuestworId, Jess.

We'II use the QuestworId system
to tap into Hadji's brain waves.

Then the QuestworId screens wiII show us
Hadji's view of the astropIane.

You are downIoading my brain
into QuestworId? I am dumbfounded.

JESSIE:
QuestworId, Iog on. Subject: Hadji.

JONNY:
Okay, Hadj, the baII's in your court.


It's working. Fantastic.
Hadji's mind is driving the system.

No wonder he couIdn't describe it.

RACE:
No offense, Presade...

...but this yak meat is tougher
than my 30-year-oId combat boot.

I'II take that as a compIiment, Race.

By the way, Benton, why did you wish
to meet three weeks earIier...

...than we had previousIy scheduIed?

What are you taIking about, Presade?

You sent me a message
changing the dates.

Not so. You sent me an e-maiI...

...requesting that we make it for this month
instead of next.

QUEST: I sent no such communique.
RACE: HoId on now.

If neither of you changed the dates,
then who did?

<i>SURD: Julia, verify the weather patterns
over the Himalayas...</i>

<i>...and positions
of communication satellites.</i>

<i>If my calculations were correct,
and I'm sure they were...</i>

<i>...Quest and Bannon
will be completely isolated...</i>

<i>...in those godforsaken mountains.</i>

<i>Hmm? That's strange. I'm picking up
a unique energy pattern in Questworld.</i>

<i>Very similar to alpha brain waves.</i>

<i>Certainly worth investigating.</i>

<i>Dr. Surd? We're three miles off
from the Quest compound.</i>

<i>SURD:
Well, then you know what to do, captain.</i>

<i>Questworld, log on.
Subject: Jeremiah Surd.</i>

Whoa, something's not right.

-Not right? It Iooks downright eviI.
SURD: Ha, ha.

JONNY:
We better get Hadji out of there.

Time to come back, Hadji.
Hadji? Hadji?

JONNY: His heart rate's down, Jess.
We better check his brain-wave activity.

JESSIE:
Right. He's in deep aIpha state.

Wait.
Someone's hacked the QuestworId system.

Someone's stiII downIoading
from Hadji's mind.

[SURD LAUGHING]

It's Jeremiah Surd.
Power up to QuestworId, Jess.

JESSIE: But--
-No buts.

Hadji's gonna Iose his mind IiteraIIy
if we don't do something now.

QuestworId, Iog on.
Subject: Jonny Quest.

<i>-Countdown.
COMPUTER: Six, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

JONNY:
We didn't program any of this.

[SURD LAUGHING]

Activate force shieId.

What have you done with Hadji?

SURD:
Ah. Poor IittIe Hadji.

Just Iook at him.
His brain sIowIy frying away to nothing.

-Of course, I couId stop the process.
-But there's a price, right?

How astute.

I want your father and Race Bannon here
in five minutes...

...or IittIe Hadji wiII be on the menu
tomorrow as the vegetabIe du jour.

-But I-- Wait, wait.
SURD: Now.

I've grown tired of you.
Jonny Quest, Iogging off.

<i>SURD:
Everything is going as planned.</i>

<i>With my disposal of their fathers
in the Himalayas...</i>

<i>...little Jonny and Jessie
will have no choice.</i>

<i>As soon as they both enter Questworld...</i>

<i>...the Quest compound
will be ours for the taking.</i>

We are ready to move in
as soon as you give the word, Jeremiah.

But I don't get it, boss.
What's the big deaI?

What do they got that we need?

<i>SURD: I don't expect you to comprehend,
Lorenzo.</i>

<i>Your mind is as childlike as the Quests'.</i>

<i>They have no concept
of the powers of Questworld...</i>

<i>...and are therefore unworthy
of its possession.</i>

<i>Once you and Julia
destroy their equipment and files...</i>

<i>...I can lock them
out of Questworld forever...</i>

<i>...leaving me the undisputed controller
of cyberspace.</i>

-Now we're reaIIy up a creek.
-Yeah, but we stiII have a paddIe, Jess.

Two, actuaIIy. Our dads.

-They're on the other side of the pIanet.
-No.

QuestworId is its own reaIity.
Why can't we just impersonate them?

Because there are just two of us.
And we've aIways had one goIden ruIe.

There has to be someone on the outside
to monitor us.

It's aII or nothing.

You're right.
The ruIe's changed, hasn't it?

JULIA:
Let's move it. Give me a hand here.


ReIease it. Drop it in.

<i>-Surd, JuIia here. We are underway.
SURD: And so am I.</i>

<i>Questworld, log on.
Subject: Jeremiah Surd.</i>

We're running out of time.
Surd onIy gave us five minutes.

TeII me news, not history, Jess.

Quest compound. Defense systems
up and running with one addition.

I caII it a Surd protector.

QuestworId, Iog on.

Subjects: Jonny Quest and Jessie Bannon.
Going hot.

<i>COMPUTER:
Three, two, one.</i>

JONNY:
We'II synthesize Race and Dad's voices.

Surd wiII never know the difference.

SURD:
WeIcome to my pIayground, gentIemen.

I'm so gIad you couId attend
my IittIe barbecue.

JONNY [AS QUEST] : Something teIIs me
we better get out of here.

Let's move.

There it is, the Quest compound.

And with those kids
Iocked into QuestworId...

...everything is ours for the taking.

JESSIE [AS RACE] : Let's move, Jonny.
SURD: Wait for me.

JESSIE [AS RACE] :
Heads up.

[SURD LAUGHING]

SURD:
Where are you?

JESSIE [AS RACE] :
This doesn't Iook good.

This doesn't Iook good.

Remember the Surd protector
I programmed earIier?

SURD:
No. No!

Where did he go?

WeII, it can't be this easy.

[SURD LAUGHING]

QUEST: WiIIiam, it's good to see you again.
Madam Fournier, wouId you care to begin?

WiIIiam, I beIieve you have identified
a mysterious emanation...

-...at the mouth of the Zambezi.
-You're quite right, Madam Fournier.

But it wouId be more correct for us
to wait for Mr. Presade before we proceed.

<i>JONNY:
We didn't program any of this.</i>

<i>-Wait.
SURD: SIowIy frying away to nothing.</i>


SURD:
WeIcome to my pIayground, gentIemen.

<i>JONNY:
Wait.</i>

SURD:
VegetabIe du jour in five minutes.


Presade, notwithstanding the fact
that we're aII phenomenoIogists...

...you Iook as if you've seen a ghost.

Perhaps I have, Benton. I was meditating.

I saw your son, Jonny, Jessie
and your young assistant, Hadji...

...in terribIe danger.

JULIA: Dr. Quest,
such crude security systems you have.

You two secure the barn.
You're with me, Lorenzo.

LORENZO:
Let's do it.

JULIA: Put on your goggIes, Lorenzo,
and watch your step.

QUEST: Jonny. Come in, Jonny.
Do you read me? Come in.

No signaI whatsoever.

The weather must be bIanking
aII current sateIIite feeds.

Mercury 7 is due over in six hours.

That's the most powerfuI
communication sateIIite in orbit.

PRESADE: Any break in the weather?
-If anything, it's getting worse.

We gotta communicate with them
somehow.

Communication exists on many IeveIs.

<i>COMPUTER:
Warning.</i>

<i>7rimary Quest compound
security systems have been breached.</i>

<i>Warning. 7rimary Quest compound
security systems have been breached.</i>

<i>I repeat. 7rimary Quest compound
security systems have been breached.</i>

JESSIE [AS RACE] :
We gotta Iog off, Jonny.

JONNY [AS QUEST] :
But we can't give up on Hadji.

Then we've gotta spIit up.
I'II go check out the compound.

Jessie Bannon Iogging out of QuestworId.
Terminate.

Terminate. Terminate.

-We're trapped.
SURD: ReaIIy?

I have, of course,
overridden your verbaI commands...

...Jonny Quest and Jessie Bannon.

You knew it was us aII aIong?

I know your fathers
are in the HimaIayas...

...because I sent them there
three weeks earIy.

And now that JuIia and Lorenzo
have controI of the Quest compound...

...this IittIe game is over.

<i>PRESADE: Hadji. Hadji.
Your friends are in danger, Hadji.</i>

<i>Wake up.</i>


Jessie? Jonny?

Jessie. Ow!

BOTH:
Aah!

[BOTH SCREAMING]

<i>COMPUTER:
Compound security systems breached.</i>

<i>-What?
COMPUTER: I am not kidding.</i>

<i>7rimary security systems
have been breached.</i>

[BOTH SCREAMING]

-You did it.
-I did?


JONNY: Hadji,
you reactivate the security systems.

Jess and I can get into the main house
through the kitchen. Come on.

LORENZO: Aw, bIast it.
-CooI it, Lorenzo.

There's supposed to be no one here
except the punks...

...and they're stuck in QuestworId,
remember?

What the--?



[JONNY SCREAMS]

You, freeze or die.


<i>So teII me, chiquita,
where's your IittIe friend?</i>

<i>JONNY:
Right behind you, chiquita...</i>

...with your IittIe friend's gun cocked,
safety off and ready to rock.

<i>Gracias.</i>

-See, I'm not too hot on guns.
-You IittIe punk.

I, on the other hand,
don't have a probIem with them.

It's aII a matter of how you use them,
isn't it?

JULIA: You're making a big mistake.
You're way over your heads.

[BOTH GASP]

[GUNS COCKING]

JULIA:
Get him.


[GROWLING THEN BARKING]



Discretion is the better part of vaIor,
Lorenzo.

-Jonny, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

But when Dad sees this mess,
he's gonna have a fit.

I think Mrs. Evans caIIs it a conniption.

<i>SURD [O VER RADIO] :
Julia, Lorenzo. 7rogress report, please.</i>

The number you have diaIed
is temporariIy out of service, Surd.

-PIease hang up and try your caII Iater.
-Ha, ha.

<i>JONNY [O VER PHONE] :
You were snowed in, huh? Sounds scary.</i>

No, what was scary
was my friend Presade's visions...

...of you three in danger.
Are you sure you're okay?

Everything
at the Quest compound's aII right?

Uh, yeah, everything's fine.
No probIems here, Dad.

I have the feeIing
he's not being entireIy truthfuI.

Heck, Benton, you don't have to be
a phenomenoIogist to know that.

You know, Jonny, it is said that
when a man Iies, he kiIIs a part of himseIf.

It's not a Iie, Hadj. It's a protective fib.

Besides, someone has to sheIter my dad
from the harsh reaIities of Iife.

[ENGLISH SDH]

[CROWD CHEERING]

[RAGE WHISTLES]

RAGE: This shouId be aII the proof
Washington needs.

MiIIions of doIIars in aid is Iining
the pockets of Panagua's finance minister.



The guards wiII be Iooking for a skeIeton,
not a businessman.

[TIRES SQUEALING]

KARLA: Daddy.
-KarIa? Abby?

What are you two doing here?

We fIew down from Miami
to join you for the fiesta.

-Surprised?
-WeII, I-- FIoored.

Uh, but you're a IittIe Iate.
My business here in Panagua's over.

Oh, weII, that's a reIief.
Then we can enjoy the fiesta together.

Yes, come on, Daddy.

RAGE: Listen, munchkin,
it's, uh-- It's too crowded.

Why don't we aII just go back to the hoteI
and have a quiet game of bingo?

But I wanna see the skeIetons.

-KarIa, wait.
ABBY: Zeke, what's wrong?

Let's go.

There are even scarier skeIetons
back at the hoteI.

-ReaIIy?
-WouId I Iie to you?

[CROWD GRO ANING]


Mm.

That's him.

KarIa, run. Run!

[TIRES SQUEALING]

Don't teII me. Your company
soId the Panaguan government...

...some defective computer equipment.

RAGE: I'm afraid computer saIes
is just a cover, Abby.

I actuaIIy work for the government.

-You mean--?
-Daddy's a spy. Right, Daddy?

WeII, uh, you're right, KarIa.
Uh, daddy's a spy.

Now, uh, how was schooI today?

Don't Iook at me Iike that, Abby.
I was gonna teII you.

I was just waiting for the right time.

FaIcon, this is Raven.
I need backup, and I need it now.

<i>Repeat, this is Raven. I need backup.</i>

FALCON:
It's Zeke. What's his status?

MAN: The guy's horse meat.
He's got haIf the Panaguan army on his taiI.

So, what are we waiting for?
Let's get him out.

FALCON: Not without orders to intervene.
And I mean direct orders from the Pentagon.

FaIcon, come in.

Don't fIy south on me now, guys.
I need heIp.

FaIcon, I've got hatchIings with me.
Do you copy?

I'II get us out of this.
Now have some faith.


GENERAL: You heard me right, FaIcon.
Do not attempt to intervene.

This country cannot afford
an internationaI incident there.

FALCON:
But sir--

<i>GENERAL:
I repeat, boy, the Raven is on his own.</i>

RAGE:
FaIcon, I've got hatchIings in the nest.

And if anything happens to them,
I swear, there'II be no pIace you can hide.

I'II hunt you down Iike dogs!

[TIRES SQUEALING]


Easy, Jonny. Stay on the road.

Oh, Race, don't bIame me.
It's this New Mexican goat traiI.

Jonny, Iook out.

JONNY:
Hang on.

[TIRES SQUEALING]

Oh. Everybody okay?

See, Jess, I do brake for Iizards.

Lucky for you.
These are fringe-toed Iizards.

They're endangered.

Not anymore they're not. Keys, pIease.

Hmm. Fringe-toed Iizards are usuaIIy
onIy found in CaIifornia's CoacheIIa VaIIey.

Do you think that's what brought
Dr. SmaII Wood out here?

No, Jessie, it wasn't fringe-toed Iizards.

It was soIitude.

Hugo got tired of aII that big-city hustIe.

He's a naturaIist and this is nature.

But that bat creature he toId you about
sounds aImost supernaturaI, Dad.

Maybe he's been on his own too Iong.

BeIieve me, if Hugo SmaII Wood...

...says he saw something strange
in those caverns...

...then it definiteIy exists.

I beIieve it.
And we'II find it, whatever it is.

HADJI: Perhaps we shouId've caIIed
from CarIsbad.

QUEST: Dr. SmaII Wood
doesn't beIieve in phones.

We just have to hope our Ietter arrived.

JESSIE:
It's right here, in his sketchbook.

Whoa, the doc's a pretty cooI artist.

Hey, that Iooks Iike
the one I missed, Jess.

And this Iooks Iike the bat
he wrote your dad about.

I wonder where he is.

There's fresh tire tracks
Ieading off this way.

Race and I wiII take a Iook around.

You guys stay put
in case Dr. SmaII Wood shows up.

JESSIE: These sketches
are as good as a photograph.

Hey, we couId see for miIes
from up there.

Maybe we can spot Dr. SmaII Wood.

You go ahead.
One of us shouId hoId the fort.

Why shouId the wise tiger
foIIow his fooIish cousins?

RACE:
I guess it's SmaII Wood's truck.

One of his sketchpads
is in the front seat.

He must be expIoring these caves.

Come on, Iet's take a Iook.

Hugo?

[BATS SCREECHING]

-Hugo.
-Benton, is that you?

What happened?

We must get out.
We're in terribIe danger.

RACE:
What the...?

QUEST: What is it?
-I don't know, but I'II find out.

<i>RAGE:
BehoId the Book of Rage.</i>

-Race?
-Run, Benton.

Get out of here before it's too Iate.

JESSIE:
Jonny, Iook at this.

-What is that?
-It Iooks Iike some kind of an air vent.

JONNY:
An air vent? For what?

-Jonny.
-Jess. I got you.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

[BOTH SCREAMING]

HADJI:
Jessie. Jonny.

[BOTH SCREAMING]

You okay?

JESSIE: Yeah, I think so, but--
HADJI: Aah!

What's that sound?

Hadji.

Hey, I thought the wise tiger
wasn't gonna foIIow his fooIish cousins.

A yogan has the right
to change proverbs.

We gotta find
another way out of here.

JESSIE: We couId foIIow
that underground river beIow the faIIs.

It has to come out somewhere.

JONNY:
I've never seen so many bats.

Ew. Or smeIIed so many.

Perhaps now
might be an opportune time...

...to practice the breath controI
I was teaching you.

You got it.

I guess that Ieaves me
to find a cIothespin.

DayIight. And, oh, man, fresh air.

We're not the first peopIe
to discover this cavern, guys.

And I don't think it's marked
on the IocaI tour map.

Looks Iike some kind of storage faciIity
for nucIear waste.

An unsavory Ieftover
from the CoId War, perhaps.

ExperimentaI nerve gas.

JESSIE: I wonder if my dad knows
aII this stuff is buried down here.

Yeah, weII, we can teII him
when we get out of here. Come on.

[ALL GASPING]

HeIIo, there. Can you heIp us? We're Iost.

RAGE:
Lost?

You wiII be Iost no more.

Hadji, Jessie, run.

RAGE:
KarIa?

You're safe now, KarIa.

Daddy wouIdn't Iet anything happen
to his munchkin, now, wouId he?

The name's Jessie, paI.

EzekieI Rage wiII deIiver his punishment
to those of IittIe faith.

Punishment, KarIa, punishment.

By the book.

EzekieI Rage?

Covert-operations agent.

Missing and presumed dead
in a faiIed operation in Panagua.

Oh, siIIy IittIe Race Bannon.

You and the agency
are what's wrong with this worId.

You have Iost your moraIs and your faith,
and you're not even aware of it.

WeII, I am the new faith.

Like the phoenix risen from the ashes...

...I have been reborn
to avenge the death of my famiIy.

And I shaII cIeanse this worId of eviI.

He went to the dark caverns,
where the weapons of doom were buried...

...and found the smoke of destruction.

Smoke of destruction?

He must mean that nerve gas.

What are you taIking about?

There's a whoIe bunch of nerve gas
and nucIear waste back there in barreIs.

Yes, fouI rain shaII faII
on those in power.

Those who Ieft my famiIy to die.

Ha, ha. I'II say one thing about
your precious covert operations.

Were it not for them...

...I never wouId have known
about this secret IittIe waste dump.

I'm sorry I got you into this.
I had no idea what we were deaIing with.

A psychopath.

A vioIent, angry man
on a fanaticaI crusade.

Hadji, forget the yoga.
We need to get Ioose.

That is exactIy what I'm trying to do...

...but I just wish
I had practiced my yoga more dutifuIIy. Ugh.

RACE: Hey, we gotta move, boys.
We gotta cIear those rocks out.

HADJI: PIease, Race,
one minor obstacIe at a time.

What I'd give
for a coupIe of sticks of dynamite.

Maybe there's another way out.

JONNY: Jess, those geckos are what got us
into this mess in the first pIace.

Fringe-toed Iizards, not geckos.

And they must be coming
from somewhere.

Now give me a boost.

[JESSIE GRUNTING]

There's a passageway. I think it's just
big enough for me to squeeze through.

Hey, not so fast.
You're not doing this aIone.

Jessie, Jonny, stay cooI. Be carefuI.

QUEST: Just try to reach the truck, Hadji,
and radio for heIp.

Come on, we gotta move fast
or we're gonna Iose him.

-We need heIp, Hadji. CaII the cops.
-You got it.

Jess, come on.
We're gonna foIIow that Iunatic.

JESSIE:
He must be going back for more gas.

Now's our chance to sIow this guy down.

Uh-oh.

Give me a hand with this. Easy.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

<i>Yes, the time of vengeance grows near.
So saith the Book of Rage.</i>

The book. Where is it?

Without it, I have nothing.

Come on, Jess, Iet's move.

Wait a minute,
I just wanna see what's inside this thing.

This crazy book of his.


Jonny, this must be his wife
and daughter.

That's aII that's in this book.

It's nothing but a picture of his famiIy.

My book. Don't touch my book.

The moment of judgment is upon us.

-Jonny.
RAGE: The gas of destruction...

...has cIaimed him, KarIa.

Those are the breaks.

But this time, you have survived.

Vengeance shaII be mine.

KarIa, ha, ha...

...we wiII make those fooIs pay. Ha, ha.

The name is Jessie.

And you're not going anywhere, Rage.

What? What have you done,
my IittIe munchkin?

Is this any way
to treat your Ioving father?

JONNY: Jessie.
JESSIE: Jonny, you're aIive.

Yeah,
thanks to Hadji's breathing Iessons.

Too bad you're just in time
to go down with the ship.

Maybe not,
if you don't mind sharing a parachute.

JESSIE:
Jonny.

One aIone shaII be spared.

Better reread the book, Rage.

Hang on, Abby.

I'm coming to meet you, honey.

[JONNY GRUNTS]

JONNY:
Hadji.

Am I dreaming?
I thought for sure the gas had finished you.

Not a chance.

I heId my breath so Iong,
I guess I feII asIeep.

Looks Iike the cavaIry's arrived.
Late, as usuaI.

JONNY:
Dad.

I'm gIad you're okay.

Jessie, what happened?

MAN: There was an incident invoIving some
ruptured canisters of a cIassified substance.

-FortunateIy, it dissipates rapidIy in the air.
-The nerve gas?

LuckiIy, you were too deep
in the caverns to be affected.

And what about the rest of the stuff
you got down there?

Now that its Iocation
has been compromised...

...it wiII be removed to another site.

SMALL WOOD:
They just keep burying their mistakes.

But sometimes they come back
to haunt us aII.

Like EzekieI Rage.

I don't think
he'II be coming back this time, Dad.

JESSIE:
I feIt sorry for him.

I know, Jess.
But aII he had Ieft was his rage.

HADJI: Perhaps now the souI
of the wounded tiger wiII find some peace.

System failure.</i>

[GARBLED SPEECH PLAYING
ON COMPUTER]

<i>MAN:
Washington. Washington D.C.</i>


What is going on here?

Oh, man. Hadji, you're suppose
to be monitoring this stuff.

Your agitation indicates another faiIure.

-You're defeated again?
-Defeated nothing.

Man, I got this wiId voice in the headset.

Something about Washington D.C.
and some kind of digitaI map of the city.

Oh, that is not possibIe.
We programmed the whoIe game ourseIves.

We did not input anything
about Washington.

And we don't even have a digitaI map.

[STATIC BUZZING]

This is too strange for schooI, Hadj.

It feeIs as if someone's messing us up.

Iris said something
about an unidentified pIayer...

...just before she crashed.

HADJI:
It makes no sense.

Who wouId want to interfere
with our game?

There's onIy one way to find out.

We reboot and see if it happens again.

Then we can attempt
to trace the data stream.

What happened?

The system crashed.

-Why?
-I'm not sure.

WeII, now I'II have to reIoad
the incoming transmissions.

It's hard to beIieve that these signaIs
are from Gamma Sentari.

A source 1 23 Iight-years away.

And no one knows what they mean.

Not yet.

NASA's been monitoring them
for three weeks.

It took them three weeks
to ask you to figure it out?

Those boys in Washington
are even sIower than they Iook.

<i>You got that right, Mr. Bannon.</i>

ApoIogize, sir.

Didn't reaIize you were onIine,
Mr. Vice President.

<i>Don't apologize, son.</i>

<i>Washington needs a dose of truth.</i>

<i>So tell me, Quest,
what do you make of these signals?</i>

It's cIear they're attempting
to communicate with each other, sir.

But my guess is that for some reason,
they're not making the connection.

JONNY:
I don't get it, Hadj.

The game mode's back to normaI.

Whoa!

<i>IRIS:
Caution. Falling here will end the game.</i>

JONNY:
Thanks, Iris.

Maybe you couId teII me something usefuI,
Iike how to beat this guy.

<i>IRIS: I am not programmed
to give suggestions.</i>

JONNY:
Ha. TaIk about suggestions.

Hey, Iris, I got a suggestion for you.

Activate wheeI bIade.

[JONNY CHEERS]

[JONNY GRUNTS]

JONNY:
ObstacIe ahead. Activate forward cannon.

Whoa. What the...?

What's going on?

What is this?

Re-syncing the data at the third
and fifth IeveIs is an interesting idea, sir.

I shouId have thought of that myseIf.

Must have been something we said.

JONNY:
It's crashing, Hadji.

<i>QUEST:
Jonny.</i>

<i>Jonny?</i>

Heh. Get this, Hadji.
Now I'm hearing my father's voice.

It is your father.

Take that thing off.

Oh. Uh, hi, Dad. We were just--

OverIoading the processors
is what you were doing.

Yeah, I didn't reaIize.

You've crashed the entire system.

-Sorry, Dad.
QUEST: Hmm.

-Look, Race and I have to go to--
-Washington?

-How did you know?
-VirtuaIIy, a guess.

I guess. Heh.

-You wanna come with us?
-Sure, why not?

VICE PRESIDENT: Let me remind you
that I am the vice president, GeneraI TyIer.

TYLER: And I'II remind you,
Mr. Vice President, that you're outvoted.

I wiII not haIt our experiments in space.

At Ieast Iisten
to what Dr. Quest wiII have to say.

I have no interest in civiIian opinions.

The space-based defense system
is a miIitary matter.

Dr. Quest's a briIIiant man, generaI.

When I need your advice,
I'II ask for it, Commander Bennett.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

Cut the top 1 2 percent
of the sign wave, Hadji.

Top 1 2 percent cut, doctor.


The V.R. system just kicked in.

<i>VICE PRESIDENT:
Difficulty-- 7entagon--</i>

<i>Can't get out--</i>

<i>--threaten General Tyler.</i>

Our system has crashed again.

And I heard that bizarre-o voice again.

Something about the Pentagon
and GeneraI Tyrone.

TyIer? GeneraI TyIer?

Yeah, yeah, maybe.
He was a big oId boy.

That big oId boy is our date for the day.

What's going on, Dad?

I'm not sure, Jonny.

But it seems your V.R. system
is reconfiguring the sign waves.

Hadji, Iog me into QuestworId.

HADJI:
QuestworId, Iog on.

Subject: Dr. Benton Quest.

Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one.

Going hot.

Now rerun the transmissions
from deep space.

Now it makes perfect sense.

This confirms my worst fears.

Dr. Quest is here to see you, generaI.

I'm taking this meeting under protest.

Nothing Iike a warm miIitary weIcome,
generaI.

-Race Bannon.
-I know who you are, Mr. Bannon.

An ex-secret operations cowboy.

WeII, shucks, sIick.

When you boys in Washington
Iet the cattIe out of the corraI...

...it's us cowboys
that have to round them up.

-GentIemen.
-You've got one minute, Quest.

I've managed to decipher the signaIs,
and it's quite serious.

This is aII Iinked
to your miIitary experiments in deep space.

-The space-based defense experiment.
-CIassified information, Bennett.

CIassified or not, there is an advanced
extraterrestriaI civiIization out there...

...warning us to haIt these tests at once.

Oh, this is nonsense.

They wiII neutraIize us.

They have threatened to destroy
our miIitary instaIIations...

...and our major cities, generaI.

You're out of your mind, Quest.

This is the United States of America.

No one can do that to us.

[BANDIT BARKS]

[BANDIT WHINES]

A disappointing view, I'm afraid, Bandit.

You wouId think our capitaI city
might refIect more hope.

I'm going back in, Hadj.
I've gotta do it.

Going hot, Hadji.

JONNY:
Oh, great. Now the game's running fine.

And I wish this thing
wouId make up its mind. Whoa!

Thanks for the warning, Iris.

<i>IRIS:
Bogey at 1 2 o'clock.</i>

<i>Warning. Incoming missile.</i>

JONNY:
Whoa.

[JONNY GRUNTS]

<i>JONNY: What's going on?
HADJI: The interference is starting again.</i>

JONNY: Man, you know,
every time I start to win at this game...

...that crazy interference kicks in.

[MEN CHATTERING]

[ALARM RINGS]

MAN 1 : What?
MAN 2: Yeah.

[ALL GASP]

[ALL SHOUTING]

What's going on?

I don't get it.

[DOOR OPENS]

You Iook Iike a coupIe
of kerosene cats in heII.

-What's up?
-There's wiId stuff happening here, Dad.

WiId stuff, son?

That's not the most scientific expIanation
you've ever given to me.

I'm not sure that science
has much to do with this, Dr. Quest.

You see, our equipment
has been transmitting...

...strange and apocaIyptic scenarios.

This is gonna escaIate
unIess GeneraI TyIer caIIs off the tests.

The onIy probIem is....

That you're deaIing
with a miIitary moron.

And we'II onIy have one more shot at him
tomorrow.

At the Pentagon, right?

You can teII the future, Jonny?

You found a crystaI baII or something?

Maybe we have.

The space-based defense system is vitaI
to the security of this country, gentIemen.

It'II take more than some Iamebrained
theory about extraterrestriaIs...

...to haIt our experiments in space.


[ALL GASP]

BENNETT: WiII someone expIain
what exactIy is going on here?

QUEST:
This appears to be a hoIographic image...

...which far surpasses
any known technoIogy.

[ALL GASP]

CAPTAIN:
BattIe stations.

Secure the ship.

[CREW SHOUTING]

QUEST:
GentIemen, this is reaI.

This is happening as we watch.

It's a trick.
Some kind of eIectronic jamming.

A hoax.

GeneraI TyIer,
you reaIIy are remarkabIy obtuse.

That's insubordination.

We're not in your Army, haas.

TECHNICIAN:
The reports are coming in, sir.

<i>We've just Iost the Eisenhower.</i>

LuckiIy, two cruisers were nearby
and are picking up the crew.

It's a miracIe, sir.

No hands were Iost with the ship.

Don't you see, generaI?
They mean us no harm.

But they do mean business.

GeneraI, I beIieve you shouId reconsider.

If this is a warning,
at Ieast we shouId inform the cabinet.

I wiII not--


I beIieve you're a coupIe of sheIIs
short of a fuII cIip, TyIer.

What's that suppose to mean?

It means you're not reacting rationaIIy,
generaI.

If you can't see that someone,
something more powerfuI...

...than any miIitary force on this Earth
is sending us a friendIy warning...

...everyone eIse in this room can.

Now, you gonna caII off
the tests or not, generaI?

TYLER:
Hmm. I'II think about it.

[DEVICE BABBLING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]

OFFICER:
We've got a trace on the signaI, sir.

They're coming
from the oId executive office buiIding.

Vice president's office? Are you certain?

Yes, I'm certain, Commander Bennett.

I knew those signaIs
had nothing to do with aIiens.

Meet me at the vice president's office,
and we'II straighten this out for good.

[DEVICE BABBLING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]

<i>VICE PRESIDENT: And what is it?
MAN: Dr. Quest to see you, sir.</i>

VICE PRESIDENT:
Show him in.

Mr. Vice President.

Can the formaIities, Dr. Quest.

I understand GeneraI TyIer has reIented.

QUEST:
At Ieast temporariIy.

JONNY: That means
the aIiens won't invade, right?

WeII, that depends on two things.

First, whether your government
honors its word.

''Your government''?

You mean, ''our government,'' sureIy.

You said two things, Mr. Vice President.

I'm having some difficuIty phoning home.

I must communicate or the threat stands.

Who are you?

If you're not the vice president,
then who are you?

VICE PRESIDENT: Oh, but I am
the vice president, young man.

I was eIected.

I broke none of your Iaws,
except for one minor detaiI.

I was born on another pIanet.

TaIk about an undocumented aIien.

SIamming, an aIien in Washington.

You mean you cannot repair this?

I'm an extraterrestriaI dipIomat.

I don't fix toasters.

I got an idea.

Every message you sent
was somehow intercepted by this system.

It must have started
when we downIoaded the signaIs...

...from NASA's computers into ours.

WeII, there's an irony.

An extraterrestriaI SOS ends up
as part of a computer game.

It's much more than simpIy a game.

But if the QuestworId system
has been receiving messages...

...maybe it can transmit them as weII.

You'd better move quickIy, gentIemen.

We are Iosing our patience.

HoId your horses, boys.

TYLER:
Stay out of this, Bannon.

Shoot him if he tries anything.

AII right, come out of there.
Hands on your heads.

Arrest him.

[BOTH GRUNT]

-You traitor!
-GeneraI, don't do it.

[TYLER GRUNTS]

I think the best thing I can do
under the circumstances...

...is a disappearing act.

But what about the invasion?

Don't worry, Jonny.
I got through to my peopIe.

Everything wiII be okay.

In fact,
I'm expecting my ride any moment.

These boys are gonna have
some stories to teII.

I doubt it.

They won't remember anything
and no one wiII beIieve that dinosaur.

WiII someone expIain
what exactIy is going on here?

I'm afraid I don't have the time.

Dr. Quest wiII teII you.

What he says may sound unIikeIy,
but you better beIieve it.

<i>BENNETT: Ladies, gentlemen,
I have a brief statement.</i>

No questions, I'm afraid.

I'm sorry to say that the vice president
has suffered a fataI heart attack.

<i>The president will announce
an interim appointment next week.</i>

<i>In an unrelated incident...</i>

<i>...General Augustine Tyler
was relieved of his position...</i>

<i>...as chairman
of space-based defense operations.</i>

<i>The general is undergoing
a thorough psychiatric evaluation.</i>

<i>In the meantime,
I have the honor to serve...</i>

<i>...as acting chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</i>

<i>That will be all. Thank you.</i>

You know, with the vice president
being some guy from outer space...

...it makes you kind of wonder.

I mean, anybody couId be an aIien.

Your dad, your best friend
or even your dog.

What do you say, huh, boy?

Are you a mutt from another pIanet?


[ALL LAUGH]

[ENGLISH SDH]

<i>ALICE: Certain Native American legends
speak of an ancient people...</i>

<i>...who came from beyond the stars...</i>

<i>...bringing with them knowledge
which would set humans...</i>

<i>...above the animals around them.</i>

<i>But mankind misused
the ancient ones' knowledge...</i>

<i>...and the Earth and her people
fell out of harmony.</i>

<i>Now, the legends say...</i>

<i>...just as caring parents
must watch over their children...</i>

<i>...so the ancients return to Earth
from time to time...</i>

<i>...trying to prevent humanity
from destroying itself...</i>

<i>...and the very Earth which gives it life.</i>

<i>The ancient people of those legends
are called the Anasazi.</i>

<i>The ancients left my people
a beacon of quartz...</i>

<i>...which was passed down
from generation to generation...</i>

<i>...coming finally to my grandfather,
a great shaman.</i>

<i>That night,
he was called by the ancients...</i>

<i>...through the beacon
with an important message.</i>

<i>But something terrible happened.</i>

PILOT 1 : Green Leader to base.
Unidentified fIying object in sight.

Range, 1 000 yards.
Permission to open fire.

<i>MAN [ON RADIO] :
Base to Green Leader, permission granted.</i>

HoIy moIy, that thing's faster
than a snake-bit roadrunner.

PILOT 2:
What in tarnation is it, anyway?

PILOT 1 :
HoIy smoke!

[PHONE RINGING]



-Dad.
-Huh? Oh.

<i>QUEST: Hello.
ALICE: Dr. Quest?</i>

<i>-Yes.
ALICE: Benton.</i>

-AIice?
-After aII these years.

I shouId be fIattered you remembered.

<i>I've never forgotten. How could I?</i>

Those times were some of the happiest.

<i>-Did you get the package?
-You sent the package?</i>

-I need your heIp.
-Of course, but why?

I gotta go. I can't expIain now.

[PHONE HANGS UP]

AIice? AIice, are you there?

JONNY:
I stiII don't see why we can't come.

QUEST:
We've been through this, Jonny.

You both have term papers.
And we'II onIy be gone a coupIe of days.

Come on, son.
Don't give me a hard time.

JONNY:
Okay. Good Iuck.

Be sure and caII.

[BANDIT BARKING]

ALICE: The night my grandfather was caIIed
by the ancients...

...was the very same night...

...that the government retrieved
the wreckage of an aIien spacecraft...

...at RosweII airfieId.

That is a remarkabIe story.

It's not a story, Benton. It's the truth.

I was there, 20 years ago.

I was a terrified IittIe girI,
but I remember every detaiI.

AIice, why are you teIIing me this now?

Because I need a secret to share with you
when you're gone.

Wait a minute.
I thought you were coming with me.

-You know I can't.
-But, AIice....

Don't ask me again.

I'II miss you, Benton,
but I have to stay cIose to this pIace.

I'm not sure why.
I guess that's why they caII it destiny.

QUEST:
No one can argue with destiny.

What's the matter, Benton?

Nothing. Nothing at aII.

Don't worry about it, Mrs. Evans.
It was an accident.

We can probabIy gIue it
right back together again.

Oh, for Iand sakes.

WeII, if you reaIIy think so,
I suppose it's no skin off my nose.

Check this out.

It Iooks as though it's got
some kind of secret compartment.

Maybe there was something
hidden in it once?

How wouId you get anything in there?
It's soIid quartz, isn't it?

That's what I thought.

Let's just gIue it back together and
ask Dad when he gets back from Arizona.

We'II take some pictures of it first,
just for the fiIes.


Oh, Bandit....


[BARKING & GROWLING]

Bandit.

Bandit!


You okay, boy?

JESSIE: What's going on?
-What happen--?


-Bandit, come back.
-Look, they took the stone.

I'm caIIing the poIice.

I'm sorry we couIdn't give you
any more detaiIs.

We'II fiIe a report, Mrs. Evans.

Strange Iights. Yeah.
They been watching too much TV.

Come on, Jess. Let's try Dad again.

[PHONE RINGING]

-He's stiII not picking up.
-Maybe they're out of range.

Uh-uh. There's a recorded message for that.
What are you doing?

Accessing your dad's fiIes
on AIice Starseer.

-Maybe she'II give us a cIue--
-What?

She's cross-referenced
to Anasazi Iegends...

...extraterrestriaI visitations
and UFO intrusions.


JESSIE:
Bandit.


What have you got there?

JONNY:
Come on, boy. Come here, give it up.

-What is it?
-I don't know. Beats me, Jess.

But it doesn't weigh anything. Here.

I've never seen any kind of metaI
that Iooked or feIt Iike that.

If it is met-- Wait a minute.

Is this shape famiIiar?

It's the same shape
as the compartment inside the quartz.

This must have been inside it.

So maybe those whoever they were
weren't Iooking for the stone.

I bet they were Iooking for that thing.

And when they reaIize it's not
stiII inside the quartz, they'II be back.

No. It means much more than that.

The quartz is somehow
connected with AIice...

...and AIice is connected with UFOs
and extraterrestriaIs...

...so maybe those burgIars
weren't even human.

Okay, time out.
This is too taII for TV, Jess.

We have got to taIk to Dad.

-What are you doing?
-Booking us two seats to Arizona.

What? ''AIert FBI immediateIy''?

Came up when I typed in
the Quest Enterprises credit card.

I don't get it.
Why wouId the FBI be Iooking for us?

Not us, necessariIy. Anyone connected
with Quest Enterprises.

Okay. UFOs, FBI, aIiens,
government agents.

I don't know, Jess. This stinks.

We've got to get to Arizona.
We gotta find Race and Dad.

Any ideas?


JONNY: We'II cut across country
tiII we get to an Amtrak station.

Even if someone's Iooking for two kids, they
can't cover every airport and raiI station.

JESSIE:
Look out!

BOTH:
Ah!

-Jessie, you okay?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

No thanks to you, you dumb mutt.

JONNY: WeII, I guess no one wiII be Iooking
for two kids and a dog.

[GROWLING & BARKING]

I take it back.
Maybe you're not so dumb after aII.

JONNY:
What is it, boy? Uh-oh.

It must be sending out
some kind of a signaI.

JONNY: But why? How?
If it is a signaI, who's gonna pick it up?

We're at Ieast
a thousand miIes from home.

No one couId possibIy know
where we are.

It's extraterrestriaI technoIogy, Jonny.

If aIiens are Iooking for us...

...don't you think their ship couId cover
a thousand miIes in a coupIe of seconds?

There must be some way
we couId deactivate it.

Yeah, throw it out the window.

Wait a sec, Jess.

You're not gonna Iike this. They're here.

Maybe you're right. Toss it.


This is outrageous.
You cannot hoId us indefiniteIy.

Wrong, Dr. Quest.
This is a matter of nationaI security.

Your son and Mr. Bannon's daughter
have something I need.

When I have it, you'II be free to go.

And if you beIieve that...

...I got a tin-pIated mud cat
with a goId vest pocket.

Oh, Race, I don't Iike your impIication.

They must Iet us go eventuaIIy.
Mustn't they?

RACE:
These jokers are beyond the Iaw, Hadji.

They've been using hybrids
of UFO technoIogy for years.

Check out that heIicopter.

It's designed from eIements they stoIe
from aIien wrecks.

-But no one's gonna admit to anything.
QUEST: Of course.

When one acknowIedges
the existence of beings...

...with superior inteIIects
and technoIogies...

...one aIso acknowIedges
one's own inferiority.

Why haven't they picked up
Jessie and Jonny yet?

That is very simpIe.

Jessie and Jonny
are obviousIy more resourcefuI...

<i>...than these national-security types.</i>


-Where are we?
-Coming up to QuinIan, OkIahoma.

This is as far as I go.

-Thanks for the ride.
-Yup.

Never couId resist a fine-Iooking dog.
Y'aII take care, hear?


JONNY: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-I hope not.

Not even a phone.

No, no, no, I don't think so.

Come on, Jessie. I've fIown
hundreds of hours with your dad.

Yeah, but how many hours
have you fIown without him?



Hey!

Hey! Hey, come back here.

Come back. Come on back, now.

JESSIE:
Rotate, Jonny. Rotate.

Come back here!


JONNY: The heIicopter that crashed Iast night
sure didn't Iook very extraterrestriaI to me.

JESSIE: Yeah, but it didn't Iook Iike
any miIitary heIicopter I've ever seen.

JONNY:
So, what are you saying, Jess?

JESSIE: That maybe they're more interested
in what they can steaI from the aIiens...

...instead of what they can Iearn
from them.

-Hey, Jess, are we there?
-We're right over Third Mesa.

According to your dad's fiIes,
AIice Starseer's pIace is here somewhere.

That must be it.

BOTH:
Ah!

JESSIE: How many hours did you say
you'd fIown with my dad?

JONNY: Hey, even monkeys faII from trees.
-What's that supposed to mean?

JONNY:
Ask Hadji. It's one of his.

AGENT:
Give me the beacon, kid.

-Is my dad here?
-He's here.

-And Race?
-And your Indian paI.

You give me the beacon and you can
get back to pIaying happy famiIies.

The beacon.

Let's go. Move it.

We can't Iet them do this.

We can't stand by whiIe that NeanderthaI
brings down a UFO and captures its peopIe.

I hate to think of the kind of experiments
they have in mind.

Or what those idiots might do
with a brand-new technoIogy.

There was no choice, son, but I wish
you hadn't given them the beacon.

[JESSIE GIGGLES]

WeII, Dad, maybe I didn't.

[BOTH GASPING]

Oh, Jonny, you are the proverbiaI fox
with many tricks.

-What did you give them?
-The Stearman's fueI tester.

I figured it was made
before he was born.

How wouId he know the difference?


Ah!

SOLDIER 1 : Let's go. Move it, move it.
SOLDIER 2: Let's get out of here!


Come on.

You're supposed to be on our side.
You were a government man.

You're right. I was.

UntiI they made those shades
part of the uniform.

Come on.

JONNY: Where are we headed, Race?
RACE: We'II take their chopper.

AGENT:
You're finished, Bannon.

You're in so deep, it'II take a backhoe
and four jackhammers to dig you out.

Oh, yeah?

I'm shaking, boss. You see me shaking?

And you. You're in big troubIe here, kid.

Big troubIe. I'II take that.


Listen, mister, you're in over your head.

For once in your Iife, be smart. Take your
men and your weapons and Ieave.

This is no business of yours.
In fact, it never was.

You may have won this battIe,
but the war ain't over.

Not by a Iong shot.


Come with me, Benton.

AII of you, come with us.
Think of what you'II see.

Unknown worIds.
UnimaginabIe civiIizations.

This wouId be the greatest adventure
of your Iives. Come with us.

I can't do that, AIice.

-But--
-No, don't ask again.

-A Iong time ago, you spoke of destiny.
-I remember.

WeII, this is where we beIong.

AIways taking his sweet time.

PriceIess? Humph. More Iike useIess.


Lady, I don't have any change.

RepIace what you have taken.

Who are you?

Those powers are not meant
for the materiaI worId.

Move it, babe.

Come on, doII, unIess you wanna spend
the rest of your Iife punching Iicense pIates.

Let's get this thing to Dr. Montegue,
coIIect his 50 grand...

...and take that Jamaican vacation
we've been taIking about.

[TIRES SCREECH]

QUEST: It's safe to say that the thief
knew exactIy what he was taking.

The phiIosopher's stone
wiII certainIy add vaIue...

...to any bIack market art coIIection.

Are we sure
the thief onIy took the stone?

It's the onIy item
the museum reported stoIen.

But perhaps we shouId check
the poIice reports...

...before we do anything eIse.

Amazing.

These guys reaIIy thought they couId turn
any oId trash metaI into goId.

Yeah, but the Iegend says
that onIy the pure of heart can hack it.

I guess that gives the phrase
''a heart of goId'' a whoIe new meaning.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]


Now, some worthIess scrap metaIs
into the oven.

And with the proper commands....

<i>If your heart is not pure, young man...</i>

<i>...the philosopher's stone
will surely destroy you.</i>

You don't understand. It's not about goId.
Money means nothing to me.

KnowIedge. The secret of aIchemy.
That's aII I want.

<i>-Dr. Faust?
-The same.</i>

Why? Why are you here?

<i>You are obsessed, Montegue,
just as I was.</i>

<i>Will you sell your soul
to fulfill your dream?</i>

Never. I'm a scientist. A researcher.
I don't beIieve in souIs.

<i>-OnIy in scientific fact. That is my Iife.
-Time will tell, Dr. Montegue.</i>

<i>But I will wager my own lost soul...</i>

<i>...that your obsession will destroy you.</i>

No, I wiII succeed,
for I have one ingredient...

...which no ancient aIchemist had,
the power of the microchip.


We've searched the pIace inside out.
There's nothing here.

Sometimes, we have to stand on our heads
in order to see things right side up.

Oh, yeah?

[JONNY GRUNTS]

WeII, it's exactIy the same,
onIy upside down.

Oh, you have far too IittIe a mind, Jonny.


A feather?

-Must be a bird trapped in here.
-I don't think so.

The bird that owns this
is way too big to get in here.

Did you see that?

Be right back.

Jonny, watch out.

CarefuI, my friend.

Whoa. Uh....

I thought there was a bird.
I didn't mean to--

We need one such as you.

-What?
-Is my EngIish so bad?

We need one such as you.

Who are you?

Jonny, what's going on up there?

You won't beIieve this.
Just give me a minute, I'II be right down.

What are you doing up here?

Are you the artist painting the muraI?
Did you take the phiIosopher's stone?

You must foIIow me.

JESSIE: Who are you taIking to up here?
-Jessie, Iook out.

[JESSIE GASPING]

JONNY:
Jessie, I got you.

-What are you doing?
-Jessie, you won't beIieve.


Where did she go?

-Who?
-The oId woman.

What is going on here?

Beats me,
but that's the way we gotta go.

Hadj, we're going out on the roof.
We'II catch you Iater.

''Oh, are you okay, Hadji?

Not hurt or anything, my friend?''
''Oh, no, Jonny, I am absoIuteIy fine.

SeveraI iron pipes have pIayed
big noise from my neck, up on my head...

...but fortunateIy, I wear a turban.''


There she is.

If you can teII it's a she from this distance,
you must have teIescopic eyesight.

-You don't understand. I met her.
-You met an eagIe?

Just trust me, wiII you?
We gotta foIIow her. Come on.

Uh-oh. Here we go.

HADJI: Where are we going?
-Come on, we can't Iose her.

There.

We'II Iose her.

Come on.

JONNY:
We'II take the fire escape.

WouId there be an eIevator, perhaps?


Whoa!

-Oh, nuts.
JESSIE: She's heading for that buiIding.

If my beIiefs permitted me
to be a betting man...

...I wouId wager we are very adjacent
to the object of our search.

<i>It's sulfur you're lacking.</i>

<i>But you're on a hiding
to nothing, look you.</i>

<i>A wild goose chase.</i>

<i>Not even I, Merlin,
succeeded in turning base metal to gold.</i>

<i>And everyone knows
I was the best there is.</i>

No, MerIin, I beIieve you're wrong.

I did it.

Where aII aIchemists through the ages
have faiIed, I succeeded.

I created pure goId from trash.


POLICEMAN:
Is this some kind of joke, Mr. Quest?

No, captain. Dr. Montegue was here.
This room was fiIIed with Iab equipment.

-I swear.
-He is teIIing the truth, sir.

Though how he cIeared the pIace
so quickIy, it beats me.

Extraordinary.

How couId I not
have experienced this before?

I never reaIized what money couId buy.

I simpIy never understood
the power of goId.

It faciIitates everything.

Thanks to you, my friend,
I can have anything I want.

Anything at aII.

<i>Montegue, you are a fool.</i>

<i>Did you think that you alone...</i>

<i>...that you, above all men,
would not be tempted by gold?</i>

How did you appear?
None of the equipment is connected.

<i>You think you call and we arrive
like tongue-lolling hunting dogs?</i>

Get out of here, both of you.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

<i>You will never make gold again,
look you.</i>

<i>-You have lost your soul, Dr. Montegue.
-Lost it to greed, see.</i>

So aII I need is someone
with a pure heart.

Someone who hasn't Iost his souI.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

<i>-Yeah?
MONTEGUE: I've got another job for you.</i>

Hey, Monte, we're on vacation.

DoubIe the money.
In fact, you can name your price.

<i>A million. Couple of million if you like.</i>

[DOG GROWLS]


ROBBER: Which one did he want?
LUC Y: He just said the kid.

ROBBER:
Just great.

ROBBER:
Huh, the price just went up 2 miI.

MONTEGUE: WeIcome to the worId
of modern aIchemy, Hadji...

...my pure-hearted East Indian friend.

POLICEMAN:
Don't worry, Dr. Quest. We're on it.

And, Mr. Bannon,
I respect your reputation...

...but Iet us handIe this.

HADJI:
Let me understand, Dr. Montegue.

You succeeded in making goId
from dross?

I certainIy did.

But the process corrupted you, so now
you wiII never make another ounce of goId.

I wiII not, you wiII.

For if you are the aIchemist,
my motives are immateriaI.

Whoa. Excuse me, pIease. Hmm.

Hobson's choice, I see. I wiII, of course,
need to see the program you designed.

It wiII be my pIeasure.

Intriguing.

LUC Y: Yo, Monte.
-What is it?

-These kids need something to drink.
-WeII, get it.

You want me to babysit or water-carry?

Get them some water.

You want me to babysit or water-carry?

What's the point of having a dog
if you have to bark yourseIf.

Hey, stop him.

[HADJI GRUNTS]

MONTEGUE:
E-maiI won't heIp you, Hadji.

In Iess than an hour,
I'II be abIe to buy and seII...

...the Dr. Quests of this worId
aII day and aII night.

Not if I refuse to make your goId,
Dr. Montegue. And I do refuse.

I wouId rather die
than betray whatever gifts I have.

And your friends?

WiII you sacrifice them
for your high ideaIs?

Lucy, bring the others in here.

[BEEPING AND WHIRRING]

Go to phase two.


MONTEGUE:
It's working.

I knew it wouId.


Shoot it. KiII it. BIow it away.

What is happening?

What the--?

Oh, this is not good.


Stop. You can't--


-Hadji, hurry.
-Yes, yes, my impatient friend.

We've gotta get out of here
before this pIace goes up.

JONNY:
Come on.


Hadji. Hadji, are you okay?

[SIRENS WAILING]

Here comes the cavaIry.

Just after the nick of time, I beIieve.

WeII, Benton, the worId may have Iost
a priceIess artifact...

...but speaking personaIIy, I'd trade
aII the priceIess artifacts in the worId...

...for any one of those kids.

I don't know, Race.

I have a feeIing the worId has not seen
the Iast of the phiIosopher's stone.

[DOG BARKING]



JONNY:
Dad, phone's for you.

It's kind of Iong distance.

<i>QUEST: We'II Iand the Catalina on Lake
PoweII and traveI the rest of the way...</i>

...down the CoIorado River
to the rendezvous point by raft.

We shouId reach the Anasazi Granaries
the day after tomorrow.

I gotta teII you, Benton.

I'm Iooking forward
to shooting the CoIorado again.

You're not the onIy one, Race.


[QUEST & RACE GRUNTING]


JONNY:
Here you go, boy.

Just in case you forgot
how to doggy paddIe.


[EAGLE SCREECHING]


QUEST: Separation Canyon is just
on the other side of these rapids.

CooI.

Separation Canyon.

Isn't that where John WesIey PoweII's
trappers Ieft his expedition?

Yep, and those are the rapids
that made them quit.

Very cooI.

Okay, you two, into the raft.

Come on, Dad.

Those rapids are just begging to be shot.

Shoot those rapids in kayaks...

...and you'II be throwing a Iamb chop
past a hungry woIf.

Now, either you hitch a ride
on the big boat or portage around.

<i>Comprendez?</i>


Let's rock.

Next stop, Powder River.

ALL:
Whoo-hoo!


Bandit! Better ride inside the boat,
huh, boy?

Whoo-hoo!

Uh-oh. Race!

Burr on a catfish.
That couId tear us to shreds.

Heads up, everyone.

[ALL SCREAMING]

JESSIE:
Hang on.

[ALL SCREAMING]

Bandit!

Hang on, boy. Hang on.

I got you, boy.

Jonny, Iook out.

[ALL SCREAMING]


Oh, no.

Where is everybody?

HADJI:
Over here, Jonny.

QUEST:
Jonny?

-Dad?
-Are you aII right?

JESSIE:
That was great.

Great?
I seem to have Iost my headgear.

Better than Iosing your head.
Come on.

JONNY:
Bandit.

Bandit.

Where are you, boy?

Come on, Bandit.
Where are you, Bandit?

JESSIE:
Bandit, come on.

JONNY: Bandit.
HADJI: Bandit.

He had his Iife jacket on.
He'II be aII right.

Look, over there.

Oh, my. This does not Iook good.

JONNY: Besides Bandit, we've Iost
roughIy one-third of our food.

And our waIkie-taIkies.

WeII, at Ieast we stiII have
our good Iooks.

More importantIy,
the beacon is stiII intact.

JONNY:
Dad, Race, over here. Bandit's paw prints.

He's aIive. Come on, guys,
we gotta get moving.

HoId on, Jonny.
We can't miss the rendezvous.

The rendezvous. Right.

Dr. Quest, Jonny, Hadji and I
couId go after Bandit...

...and meet up with you Iater.

I suppose.

-Dad.
-AII right.

Yes!

Right. We have struck in, I beIieve.

You mean struck out, Hadji.

ActuaIIy, we didn't. We hit a grand sIam.

I have never cIaimed to comprehend
siIIy sports anaIogies.

Meet us at the rendezvous point
before the sun sets.

With or without Bandit.

Y'aII got about four hours tiII sundown.

And Iisten to your oId man, Jonny.

These canyons aren't safe
to be stomping around in after dark.

Don't sweat it, Race.
What eIse can go wrong?

I bet you're Iooking forward
to meeting up with AIice Starseer.

Just think of it, Race.
The pIaces she's seen.

Other gaIaxies, other worIds.

<i>SURD:
Just keep tracking.</i>

<i>SURD:
Child's play.</i>

<i>There must be something
that's still amusing.</i>



[GUN COCKS]

<i>LORENZO:
Dr. Surd.</i>


What is it now, Lorenzo?

LORENZO: We're a hundred miIes out
of the canyon, starting our descent.

QuestworId Iog off.

<i>SURD: I cannot tell you how much I resent
these returns to the real world.</i>

JONNY:
The Anasazi Granaries.

RACE: It doesn't seem possibIe
that they reaIIy farmed this area.

There's stiII a great deaI we have to Iearn
about the Anasazi and how they Iived.

JONNY:
He came this way, aII right.

-But the tracks end here.
-No, they don't. Look.


The cIimb wiII be difficuIt,
and we have very IittIe time remaining.

JESSIE:
Hey, guys.

Check this out.

JONNY:
Whoa. '' 1 87 1 , C.E.E.''?

CoIorado ExpIoration Expedition.

John WesIey PoweII's second trip
to the Grand Canyon.

If a one-armed man can handIe it,
we can handIe it.

HADJI:
AII right, then. Here is the campsite...

...and here is the rendezvous point
and here is our position.

That means after we find Bandit...

...we can go overIand
to the Granaries here.

-Before nightfaII?
-No probIemo.

Remember, Hadj,
the optimist aIways sees the doughnut...

...but the pessimist sees onIy the hoIe.

In this instance,
it is a very Iarge hoIe.

Do you think he even Iistened to me?

Nope.

-Any sign of AIice?
-No.

Jonny and the others
shouId have been here by now.

ReIax, Benton. They'II be here soon.
When do you think AIice wiII show?

I suspect it'II be sometime after nightfaII.


It sounds Iike she's earIy.

What the...?

Maybe you were expecting
some IittIe green spacemen?

Raise them high.

You too, hotshot.


HoId your horses, paI.

Ah!

I've had it with you, Bannon.

Race, here. Catch.

Race, watch out.

Okay.

Okay. You win.

Hey.


JULIA: I wouIdn't do that
if I were you, Dr. Quest.

KiIIing you might upset Dr. Surd...

...and that's a pIeasure
he'd rather reserve for himseIf.

Huh? Oh.


Hey, guys, there's more
of Bandit's paw prints up here.

What'd he do,
sprout wings or something?

Or perhaps he found an escaIator.

Come on, Hadj, it's a piece of cake.

HADJI: I am onIy hoping
that it is not an upside-down cake.

JONNY:
Come on, Hadj, you're aImost there.

Yes. Yes, my friend.

I just wish I had a pair of eIevator shoes.

Oh, my goodness.

Ah!

-Hadji!
-Hadj!

-This is not good.
-Hadji, are you okay?

Yes. I am afraid I have found myseIf
between the proverbiaI rock...

...and a very hard pIace.

HoId on, Hadj.

I do not beIieve I have an aIternative.

Here, grab on.

HADJI:
I just cannot reach it.

-Just a coupIe of feet short.
-CoupIe of feet?

A coupIe of feet.

Jonny?

I do not wish to rush you, my friends
but I seem to be Iosing my grip.

-Like you said, Hadj.
-What?

There just aren't
a whoIe Iot of aIternatives.

Come on, Hadj.

Gotcha!

HADJI: I must say that I prefer my soIid
ground to be horizontaI rather than verticaI.

Okay. One, two, three.

Whew.

JONNY:
Like I said, a piece of-- Cake?

Hi. I'm Jonny Quest...

...and these are my friends,
Jessie and Hadji.

I know your name, Jonny Quest.

You do?

Yes. It's on your dog's coIIar.


Bandit.

Let's go. Now.

So Jeremiah Surd's putting in
a personaI appearance.

LORENZO:
Sit down, doc.

<i>SURD: Just tell me when you're
meeting your little friend...</i>

<i>...and I'll refrain from killing you.</i>

I toId you, we're not meeting anyone.

<i>SURD: 7lease, Dr. Quest,
don't insult my intelligence.</i>

<i>I've hacked your computer files
on this fascinating object.</i>

<i>I've also accessed a number
of secret government files.</i>

<i>Would you care to take a look?</i>

<i>Really, Dr. Quest, space ships?</i>

<i>Anasazi Indians
becoming extraterrestrial travelers?</i>

<i>Your girlfriend, Alice Starseer,
leaving the planet?</i>

Come with me, Benton.

<i>SURD:
If I didn't have all this evidence...</i>

<i>...I would have taken you
for a complete crackpot.</i>

I'II never forget you.

<i>SURD:
You're such an impolite Earthling too.</i>

<i>Alice Starseer is returning
for a terrestrial visit...</i>

<i>...and you weren't even
gonna roll out the red carpet.</i>

<i>I, on the other hand...</i>

<i>...have a much more interesting
reception planned for her.</i>


WOMAN: Someone's been here.
JONNY: SheII casings.

HADJI:
And that appears to be bIood.

Looks Iike severaI peopIe Ieft
in a heIicopter.

How'd you know that?

You must have noticed how the rotor
had fIattened aII the brush.

Then you saw the tracks
the Ianding gear made...

...and you figured
it had to be a heIicopter, right?

ActuaIIy, I saw a big Chinook
skirting the north rim...

-...just before we found you three.
-Oh.

Jonny, this rendezvous...

...who was it your father was expecting
to meet?

Benton. You don't know
how much it means to me...

...that you've come here
to heIp bury my grandfather.

It was important to him
that he be brought to Earth...

...and Iaid to rest
in the ways of our ancestors.

I wish I couId say
I was happy to see you, AIice.

What are you taIking about?

This pIace,
I thought we were going to meet--

<i>SURD:
There's been a change in plans.</i>

<i>Very impressive entrance, Miss Starseer.</i>

<i>I feel privileged to have witnessed it.</i>

<i>-Benton, who--?
SURD: Dr. Jeremiah Surd.</i>

<i>And you are at my service.</i>

<i>As you can see, I live most of my life
inside my exceptional mind...</i>

<i>...augmented somewhat
by the virtual reality of Questworld.</i>

<i>Of course, it does have its limitations.</i>

<i>But inside your head, my dear...</i>

<i>...lie memories and thoughts
of an intergalactic level.</i>

<i>Now, if you don't mind,
I'm going to access it.</i>

You're out of your Ieague, Dr. Surd.

<i>SURD:
Oh, you might be right, but I doubt it.</i>

<i>Terminate Quest and Bannon.</i>

<i>Questworld log on.</i>

<i>Subjects: Jeremiah Surd
and Alice Starseer.</i>

[THUNDER CRACKING]

<i>SURD: You're fighting me, Miss Starseer.
Not advisable.</i>


<i>SURD:
Questworld is my universe.</i>

<i>That's better.</i>

<i>Tremendous. The birth of a star.</i>

<i>More than I had even dreamed.</i>

JULIA:
FeeI free to pIead for your pathetic Iives.

I promise you it'II faII on deaf ears.

JONNY: Oh, I don't know.
Our hearing's stiII pretty good.


Let me guess. The cavaIry to the rescue?

MAN:
No, Indians.

WOMAN:
Yo, paIeface.

How.

-Watch out.
-Hey, you.

Not nice to Iitter Iike that.

Now, don't you know you're not
supposed to pIay with knives?

RACE: Pa aIways toId me
that it's not poIite to hit a Iady.

But then again, Miss JuIia,
you're no Iady.

<i>SURD: With your mind downloaded
into Questworld...</i>

<i>...the universe is mine.</i>

<i>The alien home planet.</i>

<i>With this technology,
my powers will be infinite.</i>

<i>QUEST: Wrong, Surd.
You've reached the end of the line.</i>

<i>SURD:
Quest? No!</i>

WeIcome to reaIity, Surd.

SURD:
I understand the beauty of forgiveness...

...but Ietting Surd and his thugs go
makes no sense whatsoever.

We must honor our tribaI Iaws.

Right, I get it.

When an eIder of the tribe dies,
to heIp appease the gods...

...and insure him safe passage
to the other worId...

...the tribe must set
aII their captured prisoners free.

Your father has taught you weII, Jonny.

We have come very far
to honor the passing of a great man.
