Yo.

Jack, it's Eddie.

All right, tick
tock, wakey wakey.

Oh, Eddie, what the
hell are you doing, man?

What do you mean
what am I doing?

It's almost 1:00 PM,
you lazy ass. Get up.

All right, all right.

Give me a break, man. I
was working till 3:00 AM.

Oh really?

Because I heard you were out
with Diane Connell last night.

By the way, she left early

because you were your
usual charming self.

She said you spent most
of your time talking

about your usual
Armageddon world theories.

Real nice job there, Chief.

How do you even
know about that date?

Well, she's a
cousin of a friend,

of my girlfriend's
second cousin, stupid.

You don't think I know?

I know you know. You're
something else, man.

Hey, uh, where's your uniform?

I don't know. Why do you care?

What do you mean
what do I care?

I told you I would pick you up.

Bro, we're playing
Pub Meisters today.

Pub Meisters, is that today?

Do not, do not tell me
you forgot. That's funny.

I didn't forget.
I didn't forget.

Okay.

But I'm not going today,

so good luck getting that
done without me, Champ.

No.

No no no, not today, okay.

Jersey, shoes, pants.

Oh my God.

What?

It's your underwear.

Yeah.

Bro, I can smell
that from here.

I don't even wanna
look at it, Bro.

I don't even wanna
look at it, Bro.

Are you, are you kidding me?

It's stuck.

It's stuck, it's hanging
on a picture now.

No, it's stuck
all right. Help!

Somebody call the fire
department hazmat team,

because nobody
should touch that.

Bro, I gotta wash my hands.
I gotta amputate, Bro.

Oh my God, help. 911.

Oh, disgusting.

I do not care about
any other game,

but this one you cannot miss.

Besides, you're our complete
offense, and last I knew

you need at least one
goal to win a game.

So, you're there.

Also, you better have
another pair of underwater

or you're running to the field.

You're not riding in my car.

All right, all right, I'm
coming, okay. See you out there.

You're dead, no,
you're walking.

Let's go.

Yes!

Nice.

Come on, come on,
let's go. Let's go!

Come on, ref, that was a foul!

Yes, Jack!

Yeah!

Ref, are you crazy?

What, you kidding me?

Six to nothing,
slaughter rule, baby.

Still undefeated. Have a
good weekend, you guys.

See ya.

Okay, so, what are you
gonna do for Labor Day?

I don't know yet, man.

I'm serious, though.

If you don't have any
plans, come out to the lake

for the cookout.

We'd be happy to have you.

Yeah.

You could bring
a date with you.

I don't know if Diane
Connell will really

return your call
ever again, but ...

You're funny.

Give me a second, yeah?

Yeah.

Hey, Sofia.

How was the game?

Good, we won. How you been?

Good.

Yeah, like okay
good or real good or?

Yeah.

Eddie invited me to his
aunt's place at the lake

for Labor Day and, I don't know,

you loved his aunt, remember?

Think you wanna go with me?

I don't think so, Jack.

We agreed, remember?

Yeah.

Ready?

Yeah.

Good game out there.

Give me one second, okay?

So you're with that guy now?

He's just an old friend.

Jack.

I really do hope you
find your happiness.

Sure.

Let's get outta here.

What was that about?

Looks like we're moving on.

I need a drink.

Whoa whoa, I'm done. I'll
vomit if I have another.

Vomit then. We'll take two.

You're not listening. Please.

Please.
Oh thank you.

This is a double.

Estrovia.

What are you doing?

What does that mean?

It means we're moving on.

What?

Who gives a shit?

Estrovia means
who gives a shit?

I mean who gives a shit?

Okay.

That's a smoke show.

Hey, how are we?

Yeah, so my buddy and I, McLovin
down there, we got a bet.

Was that a weird look or
a smile that you gave me?

You mean like this?

Yeah, that's the one.

That's definitely
my weird look.

That's good because that
would a really weird smile,

if it was.

You actually have a
pretty great smile.

Thank you.

What's your name?

Sarah, from Chicago.

So how long you here for?

Oh, we're actually
leaving right now.

It was nice to meet you.

Oh, yeah. Nice to meet you.

Can I get your number?

Yeah, I don't meet guys at
bars, especially drunk guys.

You're drunk? I'm not drunk.

Yeah, right, okay. Well
then tell me one thing.

Hm?

What's my name?

Your name?

Mm-hm.

Can't remember?

No, I know it. I know.

All right, I'll tell you
what, if you can guess my name

then you can go
back to the hotel

with me and all
my friends' party.

Can you say hot tub?

Hot tub, huh?

Your name is Chicago Sharon.

Wendy, Janet, Susan?

Oh, let's go with
the hot tub, Sahara.

Yeah, that's it, Sahara.
Where'd you come up with that?

Oh, you know, like the desert.

We have to get moving.
Can I get your number?

All right, give me your phone.

Yeah?

You won't regret it.

Yeah, I better not.

Text me when the tub is hot.

Mm-hm.

Okay, see you later.

What's up, Wood?
What's up, Wood?

What's up, Joe? Like that?

Wow, wow. How'd it go, Romeo?

You saw the look.

She said she'd text me
when the hot but was warm.

Which look was
that specifically?

You gotta be kidding
me. When'd she get here?

When you went outside.

Cool.

Jack, don't.

Hey, Sofe, how are you?

Jack, please,
I'm with friends.

That's cool.

I, I know that you said
no earlier about going

to the lake with me,
but I think you want to

and I just wanted
to ask you what time

you wanted me to pick you up at.

Jack, just leave.

Or?

Everything okay here?

Yeah, everything's okay.
I'm just talking with Sofia.

But I did have a
question for you.

Is it true what they say about
guys who drive Maseratis?

What is that?

That they lack in other areas.

You can kiss my ass.

Well I would hate
to mess up your hair.

Hey, hey, hey!

Sofia, I just wanna
have a conversation.

I just wanna have a
conversation with you!

Sorry about that.
Joe, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Why did you hang
out with that guy?

Since star
Eric Douglas got injured,

Georgia just can't seem
to score any goals.

Come on, O'Brien,
you gotta shoot that yourself.

Any
easier for Georgia.

Their next match day is against
reigning champs Carolina,

led by the Davis clan,
legendary coach Harrison Davis,

and his son, his all-star
goalie, Sam Davis.

Hi, Jack,
this is Sally.

I was just checking
again if you got

my message about tonight.

It would really mean a lot
to everyone if you came.

Please call me.

Dammit.

I can't eat
another bite of this cake.

Oh, I
think you can try.

All right, I'll try.

If you put your mind
to it. Look at that.

Absolutely.
I know you can do it.

There you go.

Delicious.

I asked for
chocolate, but I--

My body says no,
but my mind says yes.

She does that.

Jack, you made it.

I'll open the gate,
meet you out front.

Great, yeah,
I'll see you there.

Get outta here.

Dad, we've got
another surprise.

Sally, please, no
more surprises, please.

She's gone.

Do you know what it is?

Hey.
Hey, Sally.

Sorry, am I late?

No no no, of course
not, you're perfect.

Look who I found.

There he is.

Wow.

What's going on, man?
Hey, Buddy.

How's it going, man?
Wow.

Took you long
enough, you good?

How are you, man?

Good, good. Been a
while, what's up, man?

How are you? I don't care.

Hello, Jack.

Father.

This is my fiancee, Joan.

Nice to meet you.

Joan. Yeah, you too.

You must be so
hungry after that long ride.

Do you want some cake?

I'm good.

You know, I'll actually do some
coffee if you guys have it.

So, Dad, Joan been
taking you to these

breath work classes
or something?

You blew those candles
out like a champ.

Thank you, yes.

I did do a good job, if
I must say so myself.

Oh yeah.

Care to let us know
what you wished for?

Well, you know
I can't do that,

but I bet you can all
guess what it was.

Would it have anything to do

with a record fifth
championship trophy?

Maybe.

That means another one
for you if it happens.

A chip off the
old block, right?

Oh that's right, Sam,
congratulations, MVP.

Thank you, thank you.

First unanimous ever,
which is pretty good,

if I may say so myself.

I got the good
genes, right, Sis?

You know, let's face it.
We should all be grateful.

It's been a really good year
for this family, for the team.

Sam.

I was on the phone with
the governor yesterday,

and he wants you, Sally, to fill

the vacancy of
Representative Hillest.

Oh my God, Dad.

Congratulations.

Thank you!

Congrats.

Oh my God.
I've gotta call Raymond.

Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right back.

Well, it's getting
a little late for me.

Everybody, I've
gotta get going.

Little Billy isn't feeling well.

Aw.

Sounds like Daddy just
fed him too much ice cream.

Happy birthday.

It
was quite a night.

I am so excited about
the governor's appointment.

Yes.
Thank you.

Of course, Babe.

Goodbye, Sweetie. It
was great seeing you.

I've got a work-related
case in Atlanta.

I'm gonna call you. We're
gonna get together, okay?

Sounds great. It
was nice seeing you.

And congrats again.

I think I'm gonna hit
the road too, follow you out.

Dad, happy birthday.

Thanks, Paul.

I'll see you at
the game in Atlanta, right?

Sure.

Hey, Joan,
thank you again.

You know what,
I'll walk you out.

It was really nice meeting
you. See you tomorrow?

Night.

Great.

Oh, Sam, can you help
me with something?

With what?

Come on inside. I
wanna show you something.

Take a seat.

It's good to see you, Jack.

Look, I know how difficult
things have been for you.

I want you to have this.
I found it in the safe.

I think Mom would
want you to have this.

Thanks.

Jack, I'd like to say that--

Did you see the Georgia
game the other day?

Yeah. Not much of a game, huh?

Yeah, Georgia looks
like they're gonna be

in big trouble after
they lost Eric Douglas.

I doubt they can
win without him.

Look, I'd like to talk
to you about something.

Not now, please.

Maybe we can just say that
I came over to see my family

and it happened to
be your birthday.

May I ask you one question?

Sure.

Are you happy?

Am I happy?

What do you care? Think
it's a little late for that?

That's not fair.

Sure it is. Why are we
always pretending, huh?

The truth hurts, doesn't it,

Mr. Always Tell It Like It Is?

All right, look,
just hear me out.

I told you that you and I
would be able to move on

once you worked on your
temper, your anger.

If you can honestly
tell me that you have,

then I think we should
move on to the next step.

Are you doing any better?

Probably not much.

Still taking your meds?

No.

Everything they've recommended

makes it worse, actually.

Sorry to hear that.

Mm.

You know, you could
pick up the phone,

maybe call, talk
once in a while.

You know the night that
Mom died, I made a promise

to her that I would talk to you

and I would tell you
how I really felt?

I made that promise
about three years ago.

What would you have said?

How come you never
believed in me?

What?

You knew that it was my dream
always just to play soccer.

You know, play for
you. Father and son.

But then you would tell me
to aim for smaller schools

because you knew that
I wasn't good enough

to play Division One,
definitely not in the pros.

But I ended up on your team,
and you cut me in front

of the whole world
without giving me a chance

to prove myself, and
then you tell a reporter

that you knew Sam had
the stuff of champions.

You know what that's like?

That's like going, Hey,
world, the great and powerful

Harrison Davis believes
that his youngest son

isn't worth a goddam thing.

I swore I'd never
tell you this.

No Division One
school wanted you.

I drafted you onto my team
because nobody else would.

I never meant to tell you,

but you asked, so there it is.

There it is, I'm a favor?

You never even gave me a chance.

I did give you a chance.

You knew that it was my dream.

Bullshit, two exhibition
games, with half the real team

playing, that meant
nothing, you know that.

You won't say it, will you?

Come on, Dad.

Come on. Tell it
like it is, right?

You never thought that I
was good enough, did you?

The team didn't think
you were a fit for them.

It was becoming a problem
I couldn't ignore.

A problem you couldn't ignore?

I didn't mean it like that.

The hell you didn't.

That's what
you think of me.

Your loser son Jack, rough
around the edges, dropout,

didn't inherit his father's
hall-of-fame talent.

That's not true.

I knew I shouldn't
have come here.

Jack, don't go, please.

You know, I can't wait to
get outta here. You know why?

Because as soon as I cross
into the great state of Georgia

I get to take a
nice, big breath.

What good'll it
to you to leave now?

We can talk about this.

I don't want things
to go on like this.

Well, you probably
shoulda thought about that

a long time ago, uh?

Jack. Dammit!

Yes, ladies and
gentlemen, this is it.

For the championship, Jack
Davis trying to do something

that he'll never be
able to do, score a goal

on his older brother and
future hall-of-fame goalie,

Sam Davis.

Come on, boys, dinnertime!

Right now, it's gonna get cold.

Just a second, Mom.
We'll be right there.

Don't give me that we'll
be right there, Mom, stuff.

But, Mom, this is for
the world championship.

Yeah.

Okay, since it's for
the world championship.

You'll never get one past me.

Remember, Jack, visualize.

Visualize.

This is it, soccer
fans, for all or nothing.

Here we go.

What a save! Let's go!

Not in my house,
not in my house!

Never in my house. Let's go!

Leave! I have a gun!

I have a gun, and I've
called the police!

When'd you get
a gun? It's me, Jack.

Oh my God. Jack, you
scared the shit outta me.

And I don't care drunk you
are, you have to leave now.

Were you actually
gonna shoot me?

No, idiot, I was
threatening to shoot a burglar

until I found out it was you.

Now leave.

No, I haven't been drinking.

Okay, I just came from
my family dinner and,

I did what you
always told me to do.

I told my dad how I felt.

You spoke with your father?

Big surprise,
it didn't go well.

You can't just show
up here like this.

I know, I know. I'm sorry.

I just, I had
nowhere else to go.

You know what?

You can stay on
the couch tonight.

Thanks, okay, I didn't
know who else to turn to.

Eddie's great, but not
with this sort of thing.

I understand.

You know, it actually felt
pretty good, telling him.

Does that sound strange?

No, not at all. What'd he say?

Mostly the same.

Except he admitted that
he had no faith in me,

and then he blamed
it on the team.

That's about when I left.

Good for you.
I'm proud of you.

It took guts to do what you did.

And I'm sure you'll sort
it out in the morning.

Yeah.

I'll get you some blankets.

Thanks.

You know, I'm probably good
with this one right here.

Oh.

And, sorry I surprised
you like this.

No need to apologize. We'll
talk in the morning, okay?

Yeah.

You know, I've always been
jealous of you and your family?

Three brothers, two
sisters, a mom and dad and,

I don't think I ever
saw anyone do anything

bad to each other or do anything
but love each other really.

How real was that?

It was very real.

I know it's unusual,
but even as kids,

we were all for one
and one for all.

Our parents really
instilled in us

that family was everything.

We had so little, but
we really had so much.

I was very lucky.

Wow.

Yeah, my family, we competed
for pretty much everything.

And not only the attention
of Dad but also with every

stranger who wanted a piece
of him and his fame too.

We just had to look
out for ourselves.

I guess that's way
different than you.

Seems like we had so much
but really so little.

I know.

Good night.

Night.

Jack, come on.
It's time to wake up.

What time is it?

It's time for you
to go to school.

What?

You heard me.

You always promised to
check out my school,

but you never did.

Well, I decided that
today is the day.

As much as I'd like
to, I think I have

a temperature today,
Miss Portales.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny.

Isn't today Labor Day?

There might not be classes,
but there's still rehearsals

for the performance at the
fall assembly this week.

Was your friend
around last night?

Just get dressed.

Yes, ma'am.

The Thai Bar, I haven't
been here in a minute.

You want coffee?

No, I'm good, thanks.

You know what,
actually I'll for a

caramel macchiatto?

Whipped cream and
an extra shot still?

Is there another way?

Guess not.
All right, I'll be back.

Thanks, Sofe.

Okay.

And here you go.

Thanks.
Mm-hm.

You got a call from someone.

I'll call him back later.

Ah, I love this song.

You know, I haven't given up.

Really? I haven't either.

You know, I was actually
just thinking about this

that I think we're both
in a much better place--

No, Silly, on my music.

I just completed
my very first demo.

That's great.

Can I hear it?

No.

What do you mean no?

You might not like it.

What are you talking about?

I've always liked
what you've done.

Come on, email the
file to me, Sofe.

No, they haven't even
finished mixing it.

They'll hopefully finish mixing,
they said, next week, so.

Oh yeah, they'll
mix it next week?

Don't lie to me.

I'm not lying to you.

You are lying to me.
You always do that.

You blink like that
when you're lying.

I do not blink.

You do blink.

With
the morning sports.

The word is, Coach Briana
Scurry of the Georgia Wild

soccer team could be fired
if the team doesn't win

one of the two remaining games--

It's a bummer because
she's a great coach.

You know, she used to be
an assistant for my dad.

Wait wait wait, you
know Coach Scurry?

A bit, yeah.

Well why don't you talk
to her, get a tryout?

I mean, you heard
what they said.

They desperately need a striker.

For the Wild?

You're a striker, right?

Yeah, but in a podunk
industrial league. It's nuts.

Come on, I bet you're
better than that old guy

who's way past his prime.

Sofe, look, nobody will
even give me a tryout

after what my dad did to me.

Okay, Coach Scurry will
just think I'm crazy.

You haven't changed, one bit.

No, I have changed.

I just, I don't wanna put the
coach in a awkward position.

Okay, especially after
knowing my father for so long.

Why don't you think you could
play great for Coach Scurry?

When will you stop
worrying about what

other people think about you

or the expectations
they have of you?

Especially your family.

It's the same argument we
have over and over again,

Jack, and I'm tired of it.

You too, Sofe, huh?

That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

Quit playing the
victim all the time.

It got super tiring
when we were together,

and it's still real old now.

Good morning, everyone.

Good
morning, Miss Portales!

Everyone, this
is my friend Jack.

Jack, whenever we have a new
guest, we like to introduce

ourselves in our own
very special way.

â™ª With Miss Portales
and our guest â™ª

â™ª And our friend, welcome
to our little den â™ª

Okay, Miss Portales!

Welcome, Jack, welcome.

You're really not
gonna let me hear the song?

No.

Come on, at least a CD.

Oh, a CD,
really? Is this the '90s?

I don't care, I'll
hear it eventually. Watch.

Listen, about
dinner? I can't today.

I already have plans.

With who, Biceps?

That's none of your business.

Hey.
Hello, hey.

No, I'm not running late.

I told you, it's not
fair to ask me that.

I'm here.

Okay, bye.

Hey, I just wanted to
say thanks, for everything.

Thanks for letting
me stay last night.

You're welcome. It'll
all work out, believe me.

I'm glad you finally said
something to your father.

Yeah.

I'll see you.

Hey, Sofe. Let me buy
you lunch sometime, huh?

Could you handle
us being just friends?

I'll make you a deal.

Yeah, what's that?

If you go see Coach
Scurry and ask for a tryout,

I'll buy you dinner
at O'Nesta's.

O'Nesta's, that's our
spot. Are you being serious?

Do I look like
I'm bullshitting?

All right, you
throw in your demo

and you got yourself a deal.

No no, no no no, I told
you. It's being worked on.

I'll think about it.

So, are
you mad at Sally?

Why
would I be mad at her?

For inviting Jack
without talking to you.

Oh, she was just
trying to help.

I love her for that.

Hm.

I talked to Paul
a little while ago.

He says Jack's doing fine.

He's gonna have dinner
with him in Atlanta

when the team's
playing next week.

I wish I could help more.

I wouldn't recommend that.

Jack was pretty
close to his mom,

probably closer than
all the other kids.

What about you?

Oh, we got along
great when he was a kid.

Then when his mom got
sick, he just got angry.

Mostly at me, I think.

What about the other kids?

Well they were all
affected in their own way,

but not like Jack.

Unlike Sam and Sally, Jack
just bottled it all up inside.

And Paul?

Well, Paul, he was some kid.

He just took it all in stride,
even tried to help Jack.

Sam and Sally, they're A types.

Sam was actually
pretty hard on Jack.

And then finally
Jack figured out

his mom was not gonna make it.

It got really bad.

Add to that the fact
that he couldn't get

past the practice
squad on my team.

I guess that just proved
to be too much for him.

Well, looking back,
do you think you could

have kept him on the team?

It was the toughest
decision I ever made.

But my father told me

that when you're making
decisions, especially about

the players, the
team comes first,

no matter what the emotions are.

Oh, honey, that musta
been really difficult.

So, are you gonna call Jack?

Oh, I guess I'll give it
a couple of days.

I'll call him after he
has dinner with Paul.

Good plan.

Reigning
champions Carolina cruising

four goals up late as Georgia,
looking to get on the board.

Nelson strikes, easy
save for Sam Davis.

Nice hands, nice hands.

Oh, typical Davis.

Look at him taunting
the Georgia crowd.

Some may call this
confidence; others arrogant.

Come on, boo!

Look at him, man. My brother's
such a freaking hotdog.

They're up by five goals
and you woulda thought

he just won the game.

It's funny because I kinda
hear like a little jealousy.

No.

Like a tiny baby.

You know for a hotdog,
he's kinda good.

Musta been pretty
hard trying to follow

in his footsteps, huh?

Yeah, you don't wanna know.

Did your dad ever talk to
you about playing for him?

Want another beer, Eddie?

You're good?

I'm good.

Yeah, me too.

It's crazy, you know.

Your brother is
Sam Fricking Davis,

and your dad is Harrison
Davis, you know,

and you been keeping
this on the DL?

Yeah.

Yeah, no, thanks for
not talking about it

around a big group of fans.

Did you guys
know that this ...

Yeah, I'm gonna head
out. I'm gonna head out.

I'm meeting up with
Paul for dinner tonight,

and I'm putting
in a shift later.

This game's a blowout.
I'll hit you later, yeah?

All right.

Thanks again for
the tickets, man.

Anytime.

Aw, come on!

Oh, I'm not on duty.

Hey, are you available?

No, I'm sorry, I'm off
duty. Sorry about that.

Yep, get the door.

Hey.
Jack.

How are you?

Good, good to see ya.

Good to see you.

You see Dad? He just left.

Why is he here?

The whole team's staying here.

Can we go somewhere else then?

No.

No, seriously, if
they're all here,

I don't wanna eat here.

Come on, sit. Don't
worry, it'll be fine.

Sit, sit, sit. You end
up going to the game?

Yeah.

So why didn't you
use the ticket I left?

Because I went
with my friend Eddie.

He's got season tickets.

Sir?

Hey, could I get a club
soda with lime, please?

Oh, come on, I'm
leaving in the morning.

I know.

Be right back.

So let's have a
good time tonight.

Well I gotta get up
early. I got bills to pay.

Okay, well,
don't give me that.

Do you know how much money is
in that trust fund of yours?

I don't care.

You know Dad told
me he's letting you

have access to some of it now?

It's cool, but I
don't want any of it.

Okay, what are
you talking about?

You know the guy.

If I take something,
then I owe him something.

I'm not gonna owe
that guy anything.

Okay, that's not the case.

You're not gonna
owe him anything.

What, you'd rather
drive a taxi? Come on.

No, I don't
wanna drive a taxi,

but I have to do it to pay rent.

You have always been one
of the most stubborn people

that I know, you know that?

Thanks.

Yeah, you're
welcome. Thank you.

You're welcome.

Oh God.

What?

The self-anointed
king has arrived.

Hey, here we go.
Hey, good to see ya.

Dude, this is exactly why I
didn't wanna sit down and eat.

Just take it easy.

There's nothing we can
do at this point, okay.

I don't get it, man.

What, one doesn't
satisfy him anymore?

No, he needs at least
three to satisfy that ego.

I'll be damned.

Ladies, it's my two
brothers, Humpty and Dumpty,

sitting all by themselves.

This is Tawny, Patty and ...

Bridget.

Bridget, is her name.

Yeah, that's real classy, Sam.

What are you doing here, Jack?

I live here, Sam.

Oh, that's right.

You know, I was kinda hoping
maybe you would take us all

on a ride in that Ferrari
you been driving around.

He has a Ferrari?

No, he doesn't.

He just likes driving real
fast, don't you, Buddy?

I will see you all later.
Hopefully much later!

Good one.

Woo.

How does he not bother you?

I never said he
doesn't bother me.

Okay, it's just nothing
compared to you.

Why?

Because you feed into
his always hungry ego

by letting him know
that he gets to you.

It's because I can't help it.

You kinda can.

Also, take into account that
I am the brain of the family,

with no athletic ability,

so I'm not the one
competing with him.

I just think if I look
back at it, there's probably

some stuff that I
woulda done differently.

Like what?

Stood up for myself.

Even knowing that he
probably woulda beat

the living shit
outta me, I just,

I think it would made a
big difference, you know?

Is it too late now?

I'll take a swing
if you'll back me up.

Thanks.
Yeah.

You moron, that's a club soda.

I was gonna say,
that's a club.

You know, with his
tolerance, he'll have a buzz.

Oh God.

You remember what Sam
would always tell me

when we were kids?

No, what?

That there was no way
that I could be a Davis,

because I didn't have one
iota of athletic ability,

like the two of you guys do.

I was probably the son
of that weird mailman

we used to have, remember him?

The guy with the big calves?

The big calves, that
guy Craig or something.

Yeah yeah yeah, Craig.

That's funny, though, I
actually agree with Sam

because you guys have the
exact same noses.

Oh, okay, now
he's a funny guy.

No, I'm just playing, but
they were pretty similar.

You know, sometimes I like to
imagine that Mom's somewhere

listening to us
and laughing along.

You got that right.

All right, don't
forget your basics.

Two touch, let's go back.

Two or one, Eddie?

Two. Hey, hey, the
cones, the cones.

I'll hand this
one to you, Eddie.

Okay, yeah, and on that note,
that's enough for today.

Yeah, that's enough.

All right, okay. Hey,
good work today, you guys.

We, we're headed to the bar?

Oh please.

Please.

Hey, I'll see you
guys at the bar.

Yeah.
We'll see you, man.

Drinks on this guy.

Look at
that, our spot's open.

Bada bing.

Wait, the Wild are switching
Wayne Fuller to a striker.

Fuller?

Bro, this is not good.

Wayne Fuller?

My grandmother can play
better offense. Is it bad?

Okay, I need a refund on my
season tickets. Help, help.

I don't blame you. Sounds
like they're desperate.

Oh man.

Refund.

Hey, what time is it?

It is time for
you to get a watch.

No, seriously.

It's 4:30.

Yeah, I gotta go somewhere.

Where you gotta go?

Yeah, I'll be back for happy
hour. I'll tell you later.

Who is she?

I gotta go.

Okay, I'm out,
I'm out. Good luck.

I'll see you in a bit, dude.

See ya, Buddy.

Come on.

Come on now. No, no.

Welcome back.

I hope you don't mind
if I do something

a bit different today,
introduce you to someone.

Remember this name,
Sofia Portales.

I've received many demos over
the years and rarely play one,

but I think this is
something very special.

Here's Sofia with her debut
song, "High Expectations."

â™ª I'm tired of those
high expectations â™ª

Oh my God.

â™ª The prodigal son â™ª

â™ª A chip off the block and now â™ª

â™ª Be thankful, you're
even better off, hm â™ª

â™ª Tell those expectations
where to go â™ª

â™ª With all those
who doubted you so â™ª

â™ª They never really
knew you like me â™ª

â™ª That's all I could see â™ª

â™ª That's all I could see â™ª

â™ª Hoo â™ª

â™ª Hoo hoo â™ª

â™ª Hoo â™ª

â™ª Has nothing to do
with fortune or fame â™ª

â™ª Associated with â™ª

â™ª Your silly last name â™ª

â™ª Please realize this â™ª

â™ª So we can dream â™ª

â™ª Again about you,
about you and me â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Tell those high
expectations where to go â™ª

â™ª With all those
who doubted you so â™ª

Hey, can you open
the door, please?

Please.

Thanks.

Can I help you?

Yeah, I need to
see Coach Scurry.

We close at five.

Is she in there?

Do you have an appointment?

No.

Well, I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to have an appointment.

Please, this is
really important.

What's your name?

Jack Davis. Coach
Scurry already knows me.

Louise, I have
a Jack David here.

Davis.

Jack Davis?
Sorry, Jack Davis.

Jack Davis.

Who is he?

Mr. Davis, you're gonna
have to make an appointment.

Yeah, okay, well,
when can I see her then?

It'll be have to be
sometime next week.

I don't have until next week.

Okay, just tell Coach Scurry

that I found her
missing striker.

What did you say?

Yeah, let her know I found
the striker that you need.

Okay, I'm serious,
it'll be worth it.

Okay. Be right back.

Good news, coach Scurry
will see you now.

Oh, thanks. Hey.

Hey, Jack, it's been so
long. It's good to see you.

Good to see you too, Coach.

So, how's the family?

I see your dad and Sam
when we play each other,

but we don't really
get a chance to talk.

Family's, uh, doing well.

Great, glad to hear it.

So what's this about
finding the striker

the whole world knows we need?

Yeah, I know you're really
busy, but just hear me out

before you toss me
outta here, okay?

Does your dad even know
you're here trying to help me?

They beat the crap
out of us last week.

Yeah, he doesn't need
to know about this.

Okay, I know that
this can sound crazy,

but I can be the striker
that you're looking for.

I know it.

You can be the striker? You?

Yes, Coach, me.

Jack, when's the
last time you played?

I play all the time. It's
just mostly industrial league.

Like I said,
when's the last time

you played pro-level soccer?

Three years ago,
when my dad cut me.

Come on, Jack, you
gotta give me a break.

Your family and
I, we go way back,

but this just doesn't work.

You haven't played
in three years

since your own father cut you.

Not to mention that
temper you have.

I've worked on my temper,

and my touch is as
good as it's ever been.

Look, do what you need to
do, but I'm definitely better

than any striker you've had
since Douglas got injured.

Your talent has
never been the issue.

You lack self-confidence.

You've never
believed in yourself.

I walked in here and
told you that I'm your man.

I'm pretty sure that confidence
isn't the issue right now.

Well I gotta give you credit
for that, but you gotta--

Mr.
White on Line One.

Thank you.

Jack, I'm sorry, I
got a lot on my plate.

I really have to take this call.

Just give me a workout.

You're really putting
me in a tight spot here.

I know. I won't embarrass you.

Okay, I promise, just all
I'm asking for is a shot.

I'll tell you what.

I'll give you a few minutes
at training tomorrow.

No special treatment.

You better prove me wrong,
or everyone's gonna think

I flipped, and maybe I have.

You won't regret it, Coach.

Maybe I already do.
Are you even in shape?

You'll see.

All right.

Thanks.

Jack Davis, right?

From the first family of
North American soccer.

That's a good one.
Nice to meet you.

What are you doing here?

Okay.

I'm training with
the team today.

You're just training,
really? That's a little weird.

Nothing to do with you joining
the team, though, right?

Nah, of course not.

Yeah good, because I'm not
a fan of the Davis family.

Known your brother a long
while. I can't stand him.

Or your pops, who cut
me for no good reason.

Check that out.
Makes two of us then.

Because he cut me too.

Yeah I know.

Who doesn't?

Listen, man, I'm gonna
do everything I can

to keep you off this team.

We may need a striker,
but the Davis family

and the stench
that goes with it,

it's the last thing
my team needs.

We'll see you on
the field, Keep.

Who's this guy?

This is Jack
Davis, Coach Davis' son.

Coach
Davis from Charlotte?

The Coach Davis, yes.

We're gonna give him
a try. He came in.

Figured let's have a go. We
have trouble scoring goals.

So we'll give him a chance.

He's that good, huh?

I hope so. I hope he is.

He's got a good hit.
He has decent speed.

All right, I'll
go check him out.

All right, thanks, Coach.

Jack Davis.
Coach.

Assistant Coach
Creekmore, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

You ready for this today?

Hope so.

All right, we're
gonna get you set up

on those balls over there.

Need to do some
measurements of your kicks,

see what kinda shape you're in,

get you in some of
these drills too, okay?

Cool.
I want you to try to
kick all these balls

in the goal without stopping.

Between each shot,
backpedal around the cone,

on to the next ball.

I'll tell you when to start.

Cool.

Go.

Around the cone.

All the way around
the cone, hustle up.

I need it harder.

Hustle up, hustle up.

One more, come on.

Hey, Jack, need you
to start running laps.

Not gonna tell you how
long you have to run,

but if you don't maintain
a six-minute mile,

then any chances you
might have are done.

Okay.

Just get ready
to go on my mark.

Set.

Go.

Hustle up.

Good.

Good, 11:55, 56.

Barely made it, Davis.

Hustle up, back to
the balls, let's go.

Shots?

Shots.

All right, Goalie.

You sure about that?
You need a little break?

You mean like that? Come
on, I'll give you a freebie.

Oh, that's cute.

So you wanna hit the other side,

or are you just gonna
keep going left?

Ooh, I'm sorry.

You gonna put some power
behind that kick or what?

I mean, come on.

Yo, I missed your name.
What is it, Douche Bag, right?

What's up?

What you say to me?

Back off, back off!

Back in goal,
Dennis, back in goal!

Listen up, listen up!

Hey, you wanna make this team?

I got you. I got you, Coach.

All right, back to the
cones. Drilling and agility.

Touch all cones, down
and back, down and back.

Faster.

Now sprint. Sprint!

Back, down and back.

All cones, let's go, sprint!

Jack, you're up, let's go.

Come on, you're in!

Hustle up, Davis.

Play on, let's go!

Jack, you're offsides!
What's going on?

Come on. All right, we
don't play stupid here!

All right, guys, corner
kicks. Let's go, corner kicks!

Nice play, Messi.

Guys, guys, come on, we
have to be able to score

on these set pieces, let's go!

Left side, left side now!

All right, that's more like it.

Sprints, over
here, wind sprints.

Jack, come on.

All right, you didn't
embarrass yourself or me.

The coaches and I are
gonna have a conversation

about you tonight, and
we'll let you know.

Thanks for the chance, Coach.

I can't guarantee
you anything.

Got it.

All right, off you go.

See ya.

Let's go, guys!

I don't know, I
just completely whiffed

on the first header.

But you made the one
right after, right?

I don't know. I don't
know what Scurry's thinking.

I mean, I don't know if
she's gonna call me or--

I think you're
worrying too much.

No matter what happens,
I'm really proud of you.

I mean, I owe so much
of it to you, right?

Can you believe it was your song

that was playing when
I was freaking out?

But you're the one who did
it. That's what's important.

Yeah. Your song?

Yes.

Did you write that
after we broke up?

Yeah.

Are you okay with that?

Yeah, yeah, of course.
I think it's so good.

I know you hate when I say it,

but I think you're
gonna be really big.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Means a lot to me.

So how are your students?

They're great. They did so
well at their school assembly.

And they've been
asking about you.

Oh, must be the rapping.

I'd be down to come
around and see them again.

I think that
could be arranged.

Yeah?

Cool.

Oh shoot. Um.

Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take this real quick.

I'll be right back, quick.

Good luck.

Hey.

Hey,
Jack, this is Coach.

I have a decision for you.

Oh, hi, Coach,
how are you doing?

After a long deliberation
with the other coaches,

we've seen that the long
layoff has affected you.

Hey, it's okay. You did it,
and I'm proud of you anyways.

No!

Yeah.

Yes?
Yeah.

She said yes! She said yes!

Yeah, woo! She said yes!

No, no no no, it's not that.

I'm sorry.

Yeah,
sorry about that.

Oh my God, cheers, cheers.

Late here in the
second half, as expected,

a low-scoring match between
Chicago and Georgia.

It's Chicago, the home side,

that leads by a goal to nothing.

And here in the Windy City

the Wild looking to
catch a second wind.

Come on, boys, here we
go! Keep the ball, keep it!

And another
misplaced pass by the Wild.

And you can
see the frustration

in their body language.

A strike
from distance now.

Oh, it's a good save. Really
good stuff by Dennis Brady.

Georgia relying on
their goalkeeper

as they build outta
the back, and what can

Briana Scurry's team offer?

Find him wide! Find him wide!

Nice.

Better buildup
play from the Wild.

The ball, to the feet of
Florin, onto his right boot.

Blazes it!

Ooh, looks like
his age and knee surgeries

are beginning to take a toll.

Come on, come on, be on
the end to end, let's go!

Coach? Hey, put me in.

Coach, I can get us the goal.

What the hell are you
doing? Get back on the bench.

I can get us the goal we need.

Coach will tell you when
to get up, you got it?

Yeah.

Chicago's defense
has prevented Georgia

from getting out
of their own half.

After a perfect
start to the season,

winning seven straight games,
the goals have dried up

since losing striker
Eric Douglas.

Now a fourth straight
loss for the Wild.

Next week, it'll be
Dallas visiting Georgia,

and the winner of
that match will go on

to play in the
championship game.

After the chance I took
with you, that, really?

Don't say another word to me.

I should cut you right
now, with a game left,

but you know what?

I'm not gonna do that,
because I don't wanna

embarrass your father,
or your family.

It has gotta be so frustrating

when you just can't
mount any offense.

Georgia's scoring
woes continue.

Another loss for the
Wild and now they cannot

afford another slipup.

Let's head back to studio
for post-match analysis.

Welcome.

Hey, everyone.

Hello.
Hey.

Jack, do you really
play for the Wild now?

I sure do. That's a nice
jersey, looks good on you.

All right, everyone,
that's it for today.

Hey, what's his name?

Jerry.
Jerry.

Hey, Jerry, would you wanna go

to the next Georgia Wild game?

For real?

For real.

Of course.

Awesome.

Guys, guess where I'm going!

Oh, I hope that's all right

that I invited him
to the next game.

Of
course, he'll love it.

Yeah, I figured it better
be this game, you know.

I could have a
whole playing career

where I never get off the bench.

Hey, I thought you agreed
to stop talking like that.

I know.

And I just, you know how
bad I want an opportunity

to get out there, you
know, prove myself.

I know.

Should we get outta here?

Yeah.

Good day?

Yes.

Yeah?

Yeah, it was good.

Not any rapping this time.

No rapping.

Oh, and William
Ford misses again.

Coach Creekmore?

Yeah, Coach.

I've seen enough of this.

Might as well see if
Davis can do anything.

Got it. Davis, off the bench.

Start warming up, right
now. Let's go, hustle.

Let's go, Wild,
let's go, intensity!

Jerry, look,
Jack's warming up.

I hope this means
he's going to go in.

Jack, come here.

You're going in for Florin
at striker. Look at me.

This is your time to
show what you can do.

We just need one goal.

Now get in there and
do it, all right?

Yes, Coach.

All right.

Here we go, Wild, here we go!

Enough is enough

for head coach Briana Scurry.

Substitution for
the Georgia Wild.

Jack Davis, a
late-season signing

set to enter for
the veteran Florin.

With the season on the
line, can Davis be the key?

As Davis comes
on for his Wild debut,

remember, this is also
his professional debut.

He needs
an instant impact

with Georgia trailing
by a goal to nothing.

It's Davis now
combining beautifully.

Georgia on the hunt
for that equalizer.

The ball now, to the
feet of Jack Davis.

In on goal, brought
down edge of the area.

Free kick, Georgia.
Come on!

Back off!
Stop it, no, no no no.

Newcomer
Davis is giving Georgia

the spark they need.

Nice, Jack, way
to keep your head.

Let's go, let's go, Wild!

Yellow card for
Dallas defender Blake.

Georgia need a goal, and this,
a prime-time opportunity.

Davis takes his place
inside the danger area.

Diego Sanchez over
the ball for Georgia

as Lynn sets his wall.

Sanchez delivers. Davis, goal!

Yeah!

Yes!

Georgia has
tied the game at one

on a goal by Jack Davis,
and look at the Wild fans!

They are going crazy!

Georgia on
the attack once more.

Beautiful ball, Jack Davis
delivers for Garcia, oh!

How the tide has turned.

Georgia playing brilliantly now.

Come on, Jack.

Come on.

Pass to the
onrushing Jack Davis.

The cross is a good one,
Garcia with the shot!

Yeah, woo!

Here we go, woo!

And there goes
the full-time whistle.

Late drama that
sees Georgia advance

to the championship game.

What an amazing ending
to a great game.

Davis brought a tremendous
amount of energy

with him into the game.

You're
absolutely right, Dave,

and this is exactly what
the Wild have been missing.

And talk about a
phenomenal way to advance

while also winning
the South Division.

Their attack was on
fire, far superior

to anything we've
seen all season,

hitting the target 21 times.

Now let's head north to
Boston, where the Big Blue

are hosting the Preying
Mantis of Carolina.

What a year, huh?
What a month, man.

Unbelievable.

Yeah, I owe a lot of
this success to you, man.

What?

I do. I do.

Come on, what did I do?

I don't know if I
could ever tell you.

Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

Stop.

No, never, man, thank
you, though. To you.

To Boston.

Boston, why Boston?

Well yeah, with our win
and if Boston doesn't lose

to Carolina by more than
two goals, you know,

you don't have play
your father's team.

Cool.

Hey, you don't
wanna play your father

and brother for the league
championship, do you?

I don't care who we play.

Just saying.

Mm, bring them on. What?

Look who it is.

Jesus.

Cool, man, just be cool.

I'm good.

Congratulations
on your success, Jack.

You really mean that?

Of course.

Oh, and I, and I also wanna
introduce you to someone.

Jack, meet my friend Mike.

What's up, Mike?

Big Wild fan.

Yeah.

You really do know Greg?

Yeah, yeah, Greg and
I are good friends.

Wow.

Can I get a pic?

Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah.

How about all three of us?

You want me to hop into
the middle? All right.

Okay, ready?

Everybody say Wild!

Wild.

Yeah.

Look at you, big shot.

He just pinched my ass.

Greg?

I'm serious, guys.

I must be crazy. I
think he pinched my ass.

I tried to tell you
we were just friends.

No, you didn't.

Yes, I did. Mike
is his boyfriend.

He probably did that
to get even with you

after everything
you've done to him.

Yeah, no, well he got me back.

Hey, hey, hey. Final.

Uh-oh.

Carolina six, Boston three.

It's gonna be an
interesting week.

What does that mean?

It means we got a date
with my dad and Sam.

Wow.
Yeah.

You gonna be okay with that?

Of course. No no, I
couldn't be happier.

Cheers to that, Buddy.

Aint nothing but a thing.

Couldn't be happier.

Jack,
this is your father.

Look, I need to talk
to you. Please call me.

Ah!

Dammit, Jack, that
is at least twice

you've missed that today,
what is your problem?

Sorry, Coach, I got it.

Hey, sorry's not
gonna cut it, all right.

If you don't focus right now,
you're gonna find yourself

on the end of that bench,
and you know I'll do it!

All right, let's go, let's go!

Good job today, Dado.

Tell Mateo hi for me, huh?

Any predictions
on the game, Sam?

Predictions?

Yeah, I like our odds, and
that's an understatement.

Does that mean you
guarantee a victory?

You got that right.

This must be a special
occasion, though,

playing against your brother.

I'd say it is.

Any special advice for him

since this is his first
championship game?

If he's smart, he won't
try to put one past me.

Have
you talked to him?

I did. I left him a message,
and this is what it said.

If we don't win, I will
walk down Peachtree Street

wearing my brother's
jersey in a pink tutu.

All right, hey thank y'all.
Excuse me, thank you.

Thank you so much.

Oh, hey, you know what?
And I'll shave my legs.

Quote that.

We're gonna hold you to it.

Jack Davis style.

What the hell are you doing?

Hm?

Use your brain. You are
embarrassing yourself.

And your family.

Cut the crap!

Hey, hey.

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey,
our favorite spot.

Yeah.

Always loved it here.

Ooh.

So, how was practice?

Good, it's good.

We're just two days away
from the big game now.

Jack, you've been
acting so nervous lately.

Is it the game?

Have I?

No. No, I'm good,
don't worry about me.

I love you more than anyone
else in the whole world,

but I do worry about you.

Wait, what's the matter?

Nothing.

I ...

Anyway, I think
you'll agree with me

that the people who
care about you the most

just want what's best for you.

Sofe, why are you
saying all this now?

No reason.

No, you're making me
feel a little weird.

Never mind.

It's, it's, it's nothing, okay.

Okay, before we eat, there's
something I wanna show you.

Okay.

Wait a second, wait a second.

Before you play
anything actually,

there's something that
I wanted to tell you.

You know that I love you

and I care about you more
than anything, right?

Of course.

Okay.

Oh my God.

I believe that
everyone gets one person,

right, who's meant
for them forever and,

I've known for so long that,

for me, you were that person.

Oh my God.
Jack, I'm in shock.

I know, I know.

Look, I promise to love
you more than anything.

Will you marry me?

Oh my God.

It fits perfectly.
It's so beautiful.

So, will you?

Yes.

Yeah? Yeah.

She said yes!

Yes, but, Jack, you've
made incredible progress

and I'm so proud of
you, but we both know

that there's still a lot
that we have to work on

before this marriage thing.

Yeah, no, I
know, and I promise

that I will do
whatever it takes.

This is the perfect time to
show you what I wanted to do.

Yeah.

So, our song.

I know how much you always
loved when I sing in Spanish.

What the hell?

Jack, okay, don't get
upset. It was my idea.

Look, Jack, I
have to talk to you.

Wait, you did this?

Don't blame
Sofia. I called her.

I said I had to talk to you.

No, after what you
said at the house,

there's nothing
more to talk about.

Jack, you can't
continue on like this.

I can't even my own engagement
without you screwing it up.

What's wrong with you?

Just take a walk
with me. Just a walk.

And how could you be
a part of this, huh?

Thought I could trust you.

That's not fair!

Thanks for trying, Sofia.

Sorry.

Hey, man, is this Wally?

Yeah, no, it's JD.

I didn't know if this was
still a good number, you know.

I know. It's been a while, huh?

You saw the game.
That's really cool, man.

You know, I was wondering
if I could get together

with you, you know, run
it back like old times.

Sure, uh, I can
head over right now.

Who is it?

Hey, do you know if this
is still Wally's spot?

Wally who?

I don't know.

You don't know my last name?

JD, man,
it's me, Wally, man.

Look, check it out!

Oh wow.

Yeah, it's the long
hair, do you like it?

Come on in, come on in.
You don't recognize me?

No, I did.

Oh man, it's the long
hair and the beard.

You hate it, don't you?

No, it's, it's different.

Man, you know who likes
it? The ladies.

This place is like
crawling with women.

Well, Tuesday nights mostly,

but that's when we have
free hallucinogens night.

I'm just kidding. I
don't touch the stuff.

What do you think
about the place, man?

It's, it's cool.

Yeah, I did some redecorating.

Check out my new art, man.
I've been taking classes.

Yeah yeah, I haven't
been here in a while.

It's been like
two, three years.

I thought you didn't
love me anymore.

You wamt the old stuff
or something new?

No, the old stuff.

Here's your old stuff.
Here's something new.

That makes you feel like
you can fly, to the moon.

What you, what you
bring a friend?

No.

Okay, I'm sure it's
nobody. Hold on to this.

I actually gotta get going.

Yep, yep, yep.

Oh no!

What's up? What's up?

It's the cops!
Shut the door, run!

Jack, it's
me. I hope you're okay.

I'm just really
confused right now.

I was just trying to make
things better. You know that.

You and me can't go on like
this. Good luck tomorrow.

â™ª When your day is long â™ª

â™ª And the night, the
night is yours alone â™ª

â™ª When you're sure
you've had enough â™ª

â™ª Of this life â™ª

â™ª Well hang on â™ª

â™ª Don't let yourself go â™ª

â™ª Because everybody cries â™ª

â™ª Everybody hurts â™ª

â™ª Sometimes â™ª

What's up, man?

Yeah, like, it's a long
story, Eddie, all right.

So breaking news
that's just come in.

Our sources telling us that
legendary coach Harrison Davis

is set to announce
that he'll retire

at the end of the season.

Hey, Eddie, give me a
second. I'll call you back.

I'll make this brief.

I am hereby announcing my
retirement as head coach.

Effective immediately
after tomorrow

night's championship game.

I'd like to thank
my friends, family,

and all the fans, on
both sides of the pond,

for their support
throughout the years.

It's been something.

I will not answer any
questions regarding this matter

until after the game tomorrow.

Well, the rumors were true.

Legendary coach Harrison
Davis has announced

this will be his last season.

What a career.

Winning the World Cup, a
hall-of-fame professional player

in England, and then in the US.

A coach in England,
and then in the US.

He became the majority
owner of the Carolina team.

What a life in soccer,
the last 17 seasons

with this Carolina franchise.

That's right,
Dave, it certainly will be

interesting to see how
it affects the team.

And remember, he's coaching
one son against his other son.

It's gonna be much more
than a regular game.

Hey, um, I could really
use a friend right now.

Yeah, I'm at that park
behind the stadium.

I'll see you.

Yo.

What's going on?

I can't go in there, man.

What do you mean
you can't go in there?

I don't know. I,
I don't think I can.

What's going on?

I don't know, man.

I keep having these
like episodes where I,

I can't do anything.

I feel like I'm
drowning, and then ...

It's just terrifying,
man, because I don't know

when they're gonna come or
how long they're gonna last.

It's just too much now, man.

Everything, it's too much.

What's everything, the game?

Everything.

Everything, Sofia, my father,
the game, my career, my dream.

Literally everything.

Okay.

Can you try something for me?

Where are we right now?

Park.

We're in a park.

Your father's not here.
The team's not here.

The game's not even here. We're
just sitting here talking.

Win or no win, you are
still my best friend.

Yeah, but it matters if I win.

To who?

Everyone.

We been doing the
same stuff for years.

And the only people
it matters to is us.

You could be selling T-shirts
in Tahiti, man. I don't care.

The only thing that you
have to do right now

is go in there and play
a game, if you want to.

The only reason
you've gotten this far

is because you wanted to.

I didn't do any of
this. This is all you.

If you don't go in there,

I'll have to go in there
and try and play for you.

And I don't think I'll
do as good of a job.

I'll see you in there.

If you don't,

you'll regret it for
the rest of your life.

You'll hear me
from the first row.

Kevin Egan
alongside Dave Cohen.

We're set to go for
the championship game

between Georgia and Carolina.

And, Dave, safe to
say we've never really

seen a storyline like this one.

Absolutely, Kevin, in
fact, they're dubbing

this one the Family Feud.

Carolina, with owner
coach Harrison Davis,

goalie Sam Davis, as
Carolina goes for a record

fifth championship.

And they'll have to beat
the other son, Jack Davis,

a star striker and a
late-season signing for Georgia,

who will hope to try
and take the Wild

to their first-ever
championship victory.

The wait is over, as we kick
off the championship game.

Now Davis with an early touch.

And he's not really
moving, Dave.

Yeah, he
looks listless.

He might be having some kind
of issue, and now he goes down.

Jack, what the hell's
going on? Let's go!

Good news for Georgia.

Jack Davis is back on his feet.

Yeah, and only in
his second game, he's become

a critical cog in the
Wild's revitalized offense.

Certainly
helping them combine here

as Georgia go on the attack.

Up against the reigning
champions in Carolina.

Can Briana Scurry's
team cause the upset?

Sam Davis watching on. The
ball pushed wide for Mendy.

Mendy delivers beautifully,

for Jack Davis with the header!

Into the grateful palms
of his brother Sam.

Just like old
times, Jack.

Just like old times.

Jack, Jack.

Hey, we made it.

How's he doing?

Okay.

Woo!

Closing stages
of this first half.

Georgia surprisingly brilliant

here in this championship game

against the champions, Carolina.

On the attack they go again,

with the instrumental
Jack Davis.

Go left, go left, cover!

Chance for Davis!

Once more his brother
standing in his way.

All right, Jack, all right,
next time, Jack, next time!

How are you so bad?
We have the same genes.

Watch the
gap in the middle.

The first goal yet
to be scored as Carolina ...

In middle, in the middle.
 - Go on the attack through Luis Rojas.

Come on.

He meanders
his way through.

A little shimmy and a
shake. Rojas with the goal!

Against the run of play,
Carolina have scored!

Oh, Kevin, this is
gonna be so demoralizing.

The Georgia Wild has played
so well, above expectations,

only to give up a goal
late in this first half.

This now a
huge test of character

for this Georgia Wild side.

Can they find a way back into it

against Harrison Davis and
the champions from Carolina?

Anybody feel like putting
a ball in the net tonight?

Hm?

How about we score a couple
goals, maybe one goal?

Jack, can you not let
that asshole brother

of yours get in your head?

Hey, leave him alone.
He's the entire offense.

We're all out there trying.

I see that we're trying,
but it's not good enough.

It's not cutting it.

We're down by a goal, and
we're fighting each other?

Rolling over and dying
is exactly what everyone

in that other locker
room expects you to do.

As far as I see it,
you have two choices.

You can either accept
losing and the labels

that other people put on you,

or you can take your
destiny in your own hands

and get to work.

You have 45 minutes to show
everyone what you're made of,

to leave it all out
there on the battlefield,

for yourselves and each other.

Now tell me, what's it gonna be?

Are you warriors?

Yeah.

Bring it in, come on!

Get in, get in.

Who are we?

Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild!

Wild, let's go!

Come on, boys,
let's go! Let's go!

Can we do this?

Yeah.

Aren't you in the
wrong locker room?

I'm not here as a coach.
I'm here as a father.

Have you got any
idea how hard it is

to watch what's going
on out on the field?

What are you talking about?

As long as we don't score,

you get that record
championship you always wanted.

A father whose
son is suffering.

Trust me, I'm suffering
as much as you are

just watching it.

Screw the fifth championship,
if it comes to that.

Screw the fifth
championship, really?

You're damn straight!

Are you really done?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm done.

I tried to call you before
it came out in the press.

I know. I saw the messages.

I figured it was a stunt, that
you'd never stop coaching.

Me too.

So then why are you quitting?

Dad, is,

is something wrong?

Yes there is.

That's the other thing I
wanted to tell you before.

I've been diagnosed with MS.

What?

Like multiple sclerosis?

It's a process that's
gonna take some time.

So no more coaching.

Dad, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

It's okay. It's all right.

I'll deal with
things as they come.

Listen up.

This is your time now, Son.

You really deserve it.

Jack,
Coach needs you.

Yeah, I'll be right there.

That makes two of us.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Deep into
the second half,

Georgia looking
for that equalizer.

It's Carolina leading by one.

Wave after wave of
Georgia attacks.

Here they go with Jack
Davis with the cross.

Watch Jack right
there, watch it!

Sam Davis just
marshaling that back line,

but the ball falls
now for Liam O'Brien!

The game is level!

Oh, we talked
about the curious letdown

right before halftime,
but now we're all even!

It is anybody's game.

Oh my God, they got one.

The
match level at one.

Georgia possessing brilliantly.

And, Dave, look at
Carolina, the champions,

sitting so deep defensively.

Kevin, Georgia's
pressure has been relentless.

Credit to Briana
Scurry and her team,

now looking to carve out
that big opportunity.

Davis high and
wide, nowhere close.

All right, Jack, all right,
next time, Jack, next time!

Final few
seconds of stoppage time.

Is there one more
attack from Georgia?

Go back, go back!

Jack Davis,
inside the penalty area,

thrown to the ground.

Knocked down by his brother Sam.

Ref.

And the referee
has a big decision to make.

Come on, Ref! That's a PK!

Georgia
wants a penalty.

And the referee
wants another look,

so he'll head to his monitor.

It'll be okay.
Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it.

What an
ending to this match.

Sam Davis is confident
he did nothing wrong.

Jack Davis wants a penalty.

What will the decision be?

Are you kidding me right now?

Are you blind?

Penalty!

Are you blind?

Whoa, a penalty
kick is coming up.

Now the question is ...

Are you kidding me?

Who takes it
for the Georgia Wild?

No, you know that please.

Okay, okay, that's fine.

Sam Davis in goal,

and it looks like his brother
Jack will get the opportunity.

We told you at the outset ...

Here we go.

We've dubbed
this the Family Feud.

Come on, Jack.

Yes, come on.

Now, 12
yards separating Sam
Davis and Jack Davis.

The penalty kick
could decide this.

How can coach Harrison
Davis bear to watch

his sons Sam and Jack
in this decisive moment?

And Coach Davis
removing the iconic cap

worn by his father,
also a legendary
coach, Harrison Senior.

He's worn it every match
since his father's passing,

and is this the final
walk for Coach Davis?

Coach.
Coach.

All right, guys,
here we go! Go!

So here we go.

What an ending to this
championship match.

Brother versus
brother from 12 yards,

and every other play
will jockey for position

in case this ball stays in play.

Jack Davis, this his first
professional penalty kick.

And you know, you just
know, these two brothers

have been in this
position before.

Look at me.

Come on,
boys, dinnertime.

Right now, it's gonna get cold.

Just a second, Mom,
we'll be right there.

Don't give me that we'll
be right there, Mom, stuff.

But, Mom, this is for
the world championship.

Okay, since it's for
the world championship.

You'll never get one past me.

Remember, Jack, visualize.

Goal!
Jack Davis scores!

With that, Georgia Wild have won

their first-ever championship.

I've seen
a lotta game winners

but never one like this!

The goalie saved it, it
deflected off the post,

ricocheted back to Jack
Davis for the game winner!

What a goal
and what a match!

An instant classic.

Did you see it, Dad?

Let's go, let's go! Yes!

Oh my God!

Yeah, well, I guess it was
just Jack's turn this time.

You hear it?

You picked a hell of a
night to get one past me.

Yeah, well, better late
than never. We good, man?

Yeah, I'm good.

How's it feel to be a champion?

I don't know, man.
It's still settling in.

Sure as hell beats being
a champion of frustration.

You know, I can't wait to
kick your ass next season.

Ha ha, I look forward to it.

Where did that come from, man?

What, you laid him
out without me?

I was waiting for backup.

You didn't need it, man.

Come here, dude.

Thank you, man. Thank you.

Yeah, go have fun, come on.

Holy shit, can you believe it?

The best, craziest
decision I've ever made.

Thanks, Coach.

My pleasure. You were awesome.

Yeah!

Incredible game!
Dude, that was awesome!

You did it.

We did it.

No, you did it.

Remember this.

Oh my God! Are you
kid, look at this!

Oh.

I'm so proud of you.

Thank you.
