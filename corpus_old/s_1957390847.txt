<i>in medio umbrae mortis,</i>

<i>non timebo mala,
quoniam tu mecum es.</i>

<i>Virga tua et baculus tuus
ipsa me consolata sunt.</i>

[Robert Brea] <i>She was furious with
me, because if I had my law degree,</i>

<i>I could have represented us.</i>

<i>The jury ruled against me.</i>

<i>I told my lawyer
I considered suicide.</i>

<i>I drove home from Nyack,
and guess what?</i>

<i>She had left me.</i>

<i>I recall almost
a sigh of relief...</i>

[Emily Maria Landgraf] <i>Somehow it
made a lasting impression on her life.</i>

<i>My first child
came easy enough.</i>

<i>But with Patricia,
they had to open me up under anesthesia.</i>

<i>I've often thought that
perhaps the reason...</i>

<i>when I got here,</i>

<i>"Okay, I explored
the criminal lifestyle."</i>

<i>But I was an altar boy,
for Christ's sake.</i>

<i>Moltisanti is a religious name.
And still I'm fucked.</i>

<i>I met death on Route 23,
not too far from here.</i>

<i>But that was much later.</i>

<i>Back in 1967,
the man wearing the hat was my father.</i>

<i>In those days,
he didn't have a son.</i>

Five dollars says
I spot him first.

I don't got five dollars.

Then you better win,
<i>gagootz.</i> Huh?

Uncle Dick, think fast.

Oh, you want to fight, huh?

kid is my uncle, Tony. Soprano.</i>


[ship horn blows]

<i>my uncle, by marriage.</i>

<i>He choked me to death.</i>

[ship horn blows]

[indistinct chatter]

There! Pay up.

We have a winner,
ladies and gents.

Huh?

<i>and his brother were with</i>

<i>the DiMeo crime family
in Newark.</i>

<i>My grandfather
was an associate,</i>

<i>- but he stacked more</i> scharol...
Pop!

<i>...than any of the made guys.</i>

Hey, there he is!

<i>a Cadillac dealership.</i>

<i>Cara mia, fammi presentare</i>
<i>mio figlio,</i> Richard Moltisanti.

Everybody calls me Dickie.

Welcome to America.

<i>Benvenuta.</i>

America! [laughs]

Most guys 65 go to Europe on vacation,
they come back with the gout.

You come back with the winner,
Miss Provolone, 1967.


Oh. Antonio Soprano.

<i>U picceri.</i>

<i>After he murdered me,</i>

<i>Tony gave my wife and baby
his pocket change.</i>

<i>But that was much</i> later.

<i>E squisita.</i>

I'm embarrassed.
You're all such great cooks over there.

Can you translate for me?

Forget it.
She understands enough.

[knocking on door]

[clears throat]

what does your family do over there?

<i>Mio padre...</i>

The fascists killed
her old man.

Her mother never recovered.

Fuckin' Mussolini.

I don't get it.
When I was a kid, you and Vito Genovese

always praised Mussolini.

Let's not talk politics
at the table.

But I'll tell you, Dick,

it's paradise over there.

On the one hand,
you can't believe the beauty.

On the other hand,
they don't even have toilets.

I told Giuseppina that "you're gonna
live the life of a proud American lady.

And I'm gonna have my second
set of children with you."

And they'll be deluged
with a life

that they could never even
imagine over there.

Like you were, Dick,
as a kid.

These'll be your
brothers and sisters.

[clears throat]

So... Giuseppina
is your stepmother, Dickie.



[grunting]
[thumping]

[Hollywood Dick
and Giuseppina moaning]

[Hollywood Dick grunting]


who ripped you off!


Come on!
[groaning]

[music playing on car stereo]

[music stops]

[boy] Shit!
Harold.

All right, already.

This punk ass snapper.

Japped one of our runners,
took 600 bucks.

I want a full bag tomorrow.

Who the fuck are you?

The guy who one time put out somebody's
eye for talkin' to him like that.

[heavy breathing]

You winded there, Jesse Owens?
[chuckles]

I gotta quit smoking.

I agree.

Can't I get you
to switch to Newports?


[indistinct conversation]

My son here say

he gonna be Hank Aaron
when he grown up.

318 like him.

Hmm. 318, your lucky
number, boy, play it.

Yeah. Numbers
is the only chance

Black folks got to get
out of this sinkhole city.

How does that work, anyway?

Well, you pick out
three numbers,

like for you, 3-1-8.

You bet a quarter,

and if your numbers
come on at the racetrack,

then you win
$125 for a quarter.

For a quarter?
Mmm.

Bet a dollar, you get $500.

You shitting me, Harold?
Uh!

What if my numbers
don't come out?

Well, if your numbers don't
hit, you don't get nothing.

Harold collects everybody's
bets and gives it to the Man.

How you think the Italians
drive those long, fancy cars

and wear those diamond
Swiss watches on their wrists?

[band playing lively music]

[indistinct chatter]

Thank you. Thank you,
everybody, welcome.

[music fades away]
Uh...

Well, mostly, I...
I just want to say how pr...


Knock it off, Anthony.

I want to say how proud I am
of my big girl, Janice...

who is today...

a woman.

[man] Cheers!
[light applause]

You know, Janice, she, uh...

She went to her catechism.

She practiced her Latin.

She even stopped watching those
two <i>stunods,</i> Sonny and Cher,

long enough to think
about God, huh?

Too much fucking
salt on this.

At least for a minute or two,
but... boy, did she cost me.

You know,
I made a bet that, uh,

Janice would not do
her religious duties.

But if Janice did,
you know, got confirmed...

I'd shave off my mustache.

[all exclaiming]

Ooh...

[Johnny] Enjoy.
His <i>comare</i> told him

it makes him
look like Robert Goulet.

[band playing lively music]

This stuff ain't so authentic.

Ow!

Just use your fork.

But, you know,
the gravy's good.

[Johnny] Oh. Come here.
Your daughter's confirmation.

Congrats, skip.

I'm here, too, Mr. Handsome.

a million dollars.

And not
Mexican dollars, either.

What are you talking about?
[kisses]

Same fucking gang. Colored kids
hit one of my colored runners.

Threw him a beating.

You believe this?
How these people prey on their own?

Hey, Boot DiMeo's gonna
rag on me when he sees this.

perception-wise.

Even the papers say the numbers is the
biggest percentage of our cash flow.

Junior's right, you gotta get
your arms around this.

You got big ears there,
<i>gagootz?</i>

Big brother, go and get yourself some Pez.
[clicks tongue]


Silvio, Puss, come here.

<i>- Marone!</i>
Oh!

Ah? The second
Mrs. Hollywood Dick.

I was just explaining
to His Holiness, here.

I think I went to school
with your father.

Calogero Dante.

"Butch."

He said you were a bully.

Whoa, what do we got here?
The Italian actress, Sophia Lotsa-Pizza.

Get out of here,
you fucking mutt!

Uh... Sorry.

Buddha. It's Joe D.
He's up at the Boot's Mansion.

Mr. DiMaggio. <i>Come stai?</i>

Your saints name you took
in church today, Apollonia?

She's the patron saint
of dentists.

Take it from me,
chains are more effective than snow tires.

Why didn't you bring
the missus, Dick?

I tried, but the poor kid's
self-conscious about her English.

She's making progress, though.

I didn't catch the name.

Pussy.

Don't worry, Father,
it's not what you think it is.


<i>This is my dog.</i>





[announcer on radio] <i>Buddy
Durham in the light trunks...</i>

This... is... his... ball.

Whose ball?

Spot.

My mother met
his mother once. Frank.

Frank? He grabbed me
to go to some party once.

It was on the Upper East Side,
it was a penthouse.

Some celebrity,
I don't know who.

So... he and Dean, they have this donkey
brought downstairs to the basement.

And the donkey's just stuffed
full of laxatives, right?

So they put it in
the private elevator.

They send the private elevator
up, the door opens,

and the donkey starts kicking and
shitting over everybody in the party!


Oh!

Ah, your sister's cunt!

Junior,

<i>â™ª And though
It's just a line to you â™ª</i>

Picked up from most of the

Who the fuck is Overall?

He's a crazy young motherfucker
that runs the Saints.

Leon Overall.

He's from East Orange.

My cousin's, uh, the placekicker
over at the high school over there.

Yeah, well me and Harold played
East Orange Thanksgiving game.

We used to beat 'em
every fucking year.

You should have
seen this man run.

Are you sure you don't
got no Black blood?

I'm Napoletano.

Oh! I'm Siciliano.

Come on. Come over here.

The big picture, you told me this
thing was over with the Black Saints.

I know, I...

thought I schooled the kid,
Overall, when I whupped him, but...


He's got a wild hair
across his ass.

I gotta know, Harold...

aren't you humiliated
by what you just said?

I know I would be.

You're a grown man.

Fucking punk street gang?

Come on in, son. Have a seat.

I think we lost him.

Hold up. Hold up. Turn around.

Would I for sure be going to Vietnam?
Like my dream?

You heard about the G.I. Bill?

Yeah, college. Sure.

Thinking about being a...

scientist.
Hmm.

Wait over there.

No, this... this war

Two officers picked up some colored taxi
driver, had to rough him up a little.

These morons think

It spread around
the Central Ward that way.

They broke windows
up and down Belmont Avenue.

They're throwing bricks
and bottles at us.

We got two officers

[glass shatters]
[Dickie] No shit.

Why don't you go after

Oh, you'll hold

[Johnny] Janice, go home!
[young Janice] Daddy!

Take the bus.


[gunshots]
Agh!

[gasps]
[young Janice] Anthony!

Anthony! What are
you doing here?

[police siren wailing]

[indistinct chatter

My God!

What did they do?

We raided a card game,
but we got lucky.

Picked up your husband
on an outstanding warrant.

Had to take 'em somewhere.

Warrant? For what?

Assault with a deadly weapon.

The Lobster Trap Restaurant?

That wasn't him.
He didn't do that.

Where is he?

Downtown.

He's downtown,
where he might get burned to death?

What are you people thinking?
[young Janice sobs]

Janice, shut up with that!

What were the two of you doing
at that card game?

Dad took Janice to ride the
rides while he played cards.

But he wouldn't take me because I
passed gas while he was eating lunch.

Get inside, both of you!

Anthony!

He's got a temper.

<i>Ãˆ arrabbiato,</i> my father.

Yeah, he wasn't like this

'Cause he used to...

When you threw her

'Cause you used to throw
my mother down the stairs.

I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

Well, some women like the rough stuff.
Don't ask me why.

Yeah, it's funny how they're all
attracted to Hollywood Dick Moltisanti.

You wanted to get
into her fucking pants

since the day
I brought her over.

I give you permission to picture
her while you're jerking off.

I promise you, you hurt her again,

Who the fuck do you think you're fucking talking to?
You got away with it

They called him Hollywood Dick.
Imagine what he looks like now.

Tell Ma what you told me,
about the bird.

There was a bird
in the garage.

So?

It means
somebody's gonna die.

A bird would never fly into

A house is another matter.

Poor Dickie.

I still can't believe it.

I gotta talk to Johnny Soprano,

The Sposato Brothers

He couldn't make bail.

You know, I'm sorry,
I know I never came to visit you before.

My father wouldn't allow it.

I came to tell you...

he passed.

They burned him up

I brought you

I don't eat dairy.

Oh.

Well, you being

my old man said
you deserved it,

but I want to do whatever I can

It wasn't right
how they treated you.

I was 25.

I murdered a made guy

I'm here for a good reason.
You don't need to help me.


What do you want, Richard?

I'll be honest with you.

I want to do a good deed.

[Dickie] Hey, Jun'.
I got some Lady Schick blow dryers.

Livia, take one for yourself.
One for Janice.

I got bigger problems
than blow dryers.

Anthony got kicked
out of school.

Let me go talk to him.

I promised Johnny I'd take care

The way you talk,
you just confuse him.

He only listens to Dickie.

<i>Ma vaffanculo.</i>

Jun', leave me

What are you reading?

Oh, can't you read
a regular comic?

You know,
Superman, Jughead.

It's about some
Jewish girl and a knight.

And Robin Hood's in it.

I didn't know they had Jews
back in the Middle Ages.

Well... the Bible.

Anyway, your mother
asked me to talk to you, so...

What, about getting
suspended from school?

Hey, put that down, huh?

Sorry.


You know I don't like to
lean on you about stuff.

But you can't start a
gambling operation at school.

I know that...

now.

Hey, don't bullshit me.
You always knew it.

And it's not just the gambling.
It's everything.

The cherry bombs at the YMCA, letting
the air out of Mrs. Russo's tires...

I apologized to her!
You talk big about

wanting to be on the
football team in high school

and you're smoking
already? Oh!

You gotta have
a better attitude.

With your father gone,
your mother's got a lot on her plate.

You gotta be good.

I don't want to go
through this again.

I try to be good.

I don't think so.
Try harder.

Pinky swear?

Jesus.

Hey, you don't talk
to me like that.

See, you're not listening.

Fine. Pinky swear.

All right.

One time I went to Playland...

I saw the cops shoot a friend
of my dad's right in the back.

Yeah, Chickie Sasso. He still
can't move his bowels like normal.

I don't want that
to happen to me.

And it won't, <i>gagootz.</i>
Not while I'm around.

We're gonna see
that it don't.

No, no, don't... Don't.

Oh, you didn't hear?
We're off the plantation.

We got wops digging ditches
since they come over.

Hey, come on.

It's Dickie's business.
Let it go, Paulie.

What the fuck's
the matter with you?

You got a murder warrant
over your head.

I'm heading down south.
North Carolina.

So where's your mule?
Get going.

Thing is, I need to
borrow some money.

How much?
A grand.

All right, I'll tell you what.

I'm gonna give you
five C's. Yeah?

It's my gift to you.
You don't gotta give it back.

No, I want to pay you back.

Ah, it's better this way. You don't
gotta be afraid to say hello to me,

I don't gotta chase you down.
Won't come between us.

So I guess this is goodbye.

Yeah, you said your goodbye,
so go.

[man singing indistinctly]

You don't stare at those people.
They don't like it.


record you wanted.

Plus, a couple others
I picked out.

What's this?

Al Hirt. Trumpet.
He's on Carson all the time.

It's not jazz. Take it back.

These, too.

So...

you did your good deed.

Well, don't put it like that.

I plan to do a lot more.

Your poor father, huh?

He goes down to board up that
Atta Boy business that he had...

and he dies
in that horrible way.

It's just weird, though.

What, weird?

My brother's hands were soft.
Like a baby's <i>pishadeel.</i>

Always with the manicures,
your father.

Yeah, what's your point?

He never touched a hammer
or a board in his life.

What's your problem?

Well, for one thing...

my wife, she can't
get pregnant.

You know, it takes a toll.
I want a son so bad.

What would you do?

It's the wanting.

Huh?

The Buddhist will tell you:
"All life is pain."

Pain comes from
always wanting things.

A son is not a thing.

It's the wanting.

You know, Tone, we could still run that
numbers game down at the fucking CYO.

I got fucking suspended,
I can't get in fucking trouble again.

No. Fucking school
will never know.

[young Tony] I want to
make it to the NFL someday.

For that, I gotta
go to college.

So I gotta watch
my fucking ass.

[young Artie] My old man told me I gotta
run his fucking restaurant when I grow up.

What does your old man say?

[young Tony] He says I gotta fucking
rob your old man's restaurant.


Do you know who I'd wanna be?
Your Uncle Dickie.

How he fucking dresses.

He said he'd give me $500 if I
graduate from fucking high school.

Fuck, man.

Ah, you...

Oh, what do you want

Yeah.

Good to see you.

[Paulie] Much better.


Hey, baby, how are you?
Come here.

Oh... [chuckles]
Did the surprise work?

You know, I'll tell you
what surprised me.

You got shiners on

Oh, look at you.
Not a pound.

He's just a regular

But you don't tell me they moved in.

He's a doctor.

He's not operating on me.

You know, just like always.

Ah, <i>va' a Napoli.</i>

What do you got on?

Go upstairs, right now,

Johnny, it's what

Go do what I said, Janice.

Don't cry. It's only me,

your Uncle Tony.
[Dickie] Oh!

What's wrong. Cootchie-coo!
[Dickie] Oh! Oh!

Okay. All right. All right.

You know, every time you're
near him he cries like this.

I didn't do anything.

[Joanne] What happened?
[young Christopher giggles]

It's okay.

Look at that.

I don't know what it is,

Oof! <i>Marone!</i>

I should move

Where'd you learn to do hair?

I learned from <i>mia mamma.</i>

Yeah. They weren't so funny when
they were hitting me with a ruler.


First thing you gotta do is look at

We already look at the lease.

I am worried about
the fucking boiler, though.

Looked like shit.

Okay, okay. But the thing
about remodeling is,

you start with the sinks
and then you go,

"We might as well do this
other thing while we're at it."

It spins out of control.

Ah.

We don't want to be pouring
good money after bad.

Can you stop eating

No <i>capisce,</i>

All I'm saying, I don't want us
walking into a stupid situation.

You think I'm stupid?

Oh, let me ask you,
what are you, on the rag?

Every time I say something you don't
like, you ask me if I'm...

First you tell me to find a store
I can turn into beauty parlor.

I do that.
You say it looks good.

Then you say, "No, let's buy a
place already a beauty parlor."

I find this place.
Now the boiler!

about fucking plumbing?

Right. You know Wednesdays
I gotta go home.

And what are you
getting so pissy about?

Why did I make the sausage?

To make me happy?

Because I love it?

But it's not as good as
Joanne's fucking pot roast.

Oh, you're digging
at Joanne again.

I hate her.

Of course you do.

What's he want to be
when he gets older?

Thinks he's gonna be
a football player.

He's good.
I don't think he's pro material.

What do you think, Dick?

Probably not. But who knows,
he puts on a few pounds,

four years of college ball...

He should go to work
for my cousin Frank

in the patio
furniture business.

Here we go with that tune.

So maybe he's not
a ball player, but Li,

Look, you give him
the best advice you can,

you lead by example,
he'll make the right decision.

This kid's got what it takes.
That's what I'm saying.

We all do things like that
when we're kids, right?

Beat up the Mister Softee man.

If my Christopher grew up to be like
Tony, I'd be goddamn proud of him.

You want to have
your own beauty parlor?

Knock yourself out.
I'd even back it.

You want your woman to work?

No, but I'd be
real proud of her.

Owning a business.

My mama used to
take in the washing.

I always respected her
for that.

Dickie says colored men don't

He said that?

No, his exact words were
you "snuggled up close."

Yeah. Yeah,
I remember that now.

You read to him
from that book.

apparently.

He remembered details.

He didn't know

How you doing?
[Silvio] How you been?

[indistinct chatter]

how's the boy?

Wonder what they
talk about in there.

[thunder rumbling]

Uncle Dick, can I talk
to you for a minute?

What's up, Joe Cocker?

wait in the car.

You help her? Help her.

Well, spit it out.

You ever heard of this?

Yeah, so, what about it?

Well, my mom's been
in a bad mood lately.

Lately? [chuckles]

The doctor said that this medicine
could help her, but she won't take it.

So what do you want from me?

So I was thinking maybe
you could talk to her.

What about your old man?

Nah, she's not speaking to him.
He did something.

I see the way
she looks at you.

Always sits
next to you at dinners.

She bought you that
fur hat for Christmas.

I never wear it.

I mean... she looks up to you.

And maybe you could
get her some.

You need a prescription.

I can't get it
in my own name.

I know you can get anything.

Don't be a wise-ass.

I'm not, I'm just saying
it could make her happy.

Even Janice says.

Janice.

There's somebody we all
want to take advice from.


The pros play in the rain.


[Johnny] Ah, what are you doing, Jun'?
Uncle Jun'!



Oh, <i>Madonna mia!</i>

Stay down. Don't move him!

Uncle Jun'!

don't move him!


Your sister's cunt!

Corrado!

God damn it.

Here you go. Here you go.

Take my hand.
Cocksucker!



[Dickie laughing]
[thunder rumbling]

<i>â™ª No one here can love
or understand me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, what hard luck stories
they all hand me â™ª</i>

These are Frank Sinatra, Jr.
tickets for your uncle.

I gotta fly down
to the dog track.

[man on TV] <i>They boast a string
of hits that seems to have no end,</i>

<i>out of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,</i>

<i>the mighty Delfonics.</i>

Hey, kid.
How's your rash?

Uncle Dickie around?

[toilet flushing]

Hey.

Mezzanine?

What the fuck.

What?

That medicine.

Oh...

You nervous Nellie,
I got stuff to do.

Hey, hey, come here.

I want to show you something.

Holy shit. JBLs.

A pair of them are yours
to take home.

Yeah, well, they're hot.

Eh, fell off a truck.

Far out, man.

Oh!


I want to go to college.

I can't get caught
with shit like this.

Okay, my friend Hesh...

says only goys
and children pay retail.

This isn't wholesale,
it's totally on the arm.

Look...

You want to be a civilian,
I appreciate that. I'm all for it.

But pay attention to me
for once, okay?

You take the speakers, right?

At the same time, you promise
yourself these speakers are it.

Now, you say to yourself,

"This is the last time I'm
ever gonna steal something."

And you stick to it.

It's that simple.

[grunting]
[bed creaking]

Maybe... Maybe
I should get on top.

[grunting and groaning]


Agh!

Fucking Dickie Moltisanti!


It's more than a month now!

For God's sake, Corrado.

He didn't push you down the
stairs, you slipped.

He got a good laugh
out of it, though.

Any excuse not to fuck.

[heavy breathing]

motherfucker out of the White House,

somebody gonna
assassinate his lying ass.

Azalea, you got it!

Say, hey!

There's my farm boy
from the Garden State.

[chuckles]
Where's my tomatoes?

Brought you collard greens.

Ah, now you talkin'.

Sit down.

Have a hot chocolate
and Baileys.

So, we square?


Small bills.

You're doing good.

Soon I'll be in
the stratosphere with you.

Call me Buzz Aldrin.

Well, Buzz,
gonna hype you again.

State lottery's coming.

Your woman's not gonna be wearing
French footwear very long.

Now, with smack,

you got white kids coming in
from Long Island, New Jersey,

Westchester
to the East Village,

paying 30 bucks to
stick their arm in a hole.

Invisible person on the
other side finds a vein,

shoots 'em up...

Should tell you something
about the future.

You make a good point.
We'll talk.

Thanks.

This week I gotta...

gotta do something about this
guinea motherfucker or he'll do me.

Ah, DiMeo?

Nah, Dickie Moltisanti.

Controls the numbers,
whole rest of Newark.

You maybe need
an assist on the play?

Why would you want
to do that for me?

I got my own issues
with the Five Families.

I appreciate it, Frank, but...

Terms of the community.

I'd better do this myself.


Merry Christmas, Buzz.

I'm so hungry.

I got news.

That beauty parlor?
I took it over.

For me?

We'll be partners.

It'll be in my name,
but you'll run it.

Exactly how you want it.
I'll be hands off.

Oh! [laughs]

Oh, Dickie! [squeals]

Hey, what did the bartender
say when the horse came in?

"Why the long face?"

You told me that
a million times.

Yeah, so?
Why the long face?

I'm all, uh...

<i>intronata.</i>

You're mixed up? Well,
what are you mixed up about?

So many things.

Ten minutes ago, you were laughing
like an idiot. What did I do?

The beauty parlor.

The beaut...

I thought that's
what you wanted.

More than anything.

But now we partners
in business.

It's like a marriage.

I'm alone so much.

I get lonely.

Maybe you didn't
love me anymore.

Hey, if I don't
love you anymore,

you won't mistake it
for a maybe.

Someone else came along.

[voice breaking] I said yes.

Who?

Don't make me say.

What, you said,
"Yes, come fuck me?"

Is that what you're trying to say?
What else, yes?

It didn't mean
anything, Dickie.

I love you!
How many times?

I don't know.

You don't know?

So many times you can't remember?
Who was he?

I doesn't matter, it's over!
Who was he?

I can't!
Tell me! Fucking tell me.

Promise you won't hurt him!

I don't promise anything,

but you don't tell me,
it's gonna be worse.

Harold.


You fucked that

But I don't
love him, Dickie!

I love you! Please! Don't!

No, please! No! No!

[Christmas carol
playing on speakers]

I still miss at Christmas...

The Seven Fishes.
My wife used to make it.

And tripe, too.

She could make those two
things, out of this world.

You celebrate Christmas with your
<i>goomar,</i> or you stick around home?

What makes you ask?

I just remember, with my girlfriend,
it was always a big argument.

She died.

So young.

What happened?

Pneumonia.

Pneumonia?

She had weak lungs,
from growing up on the other side.

Fucked up doctors...

So much tragedy
in your life.

Your father, your mistress...

I don't even have
a picture of her.

You know, I... I try so hard.

What kind of God, huh?

I go to church
when Joanne wants.

I try to set an example
for my nephew,

I come see you...

I do all kinds of good things.

You know the Christmas song,
"My Favorite Things"?

Yeah.

Maybe some of the things
you choose to do...

aren't God's favorite.

What are you trying to say?

What do I know?
I'm a murderer.

As far as your nephew goes...

may I make a brief suggestion for a nice
Christmas present you could give him?

I'm listening.

Stay out of his life.

[Christmas carol playing
on speakers]

It's damaged.

And you're out of line
with your prices.


[phone line ringing]


Hey, Uncle Dick, it's Tony.
How's it going?

There's a party tonight,
and I was wondering

if we could get a couple
cases of Rolling Rock?

Uncle Dick?

[line disconnects]

Uncle Dick?

Hello?

There's something wrong
with his phone.

Your ass. Same as last time.

It doesn't have to be
Rolling Rock.

Does he know that?

It's not about
the fucking name brand.

Carmela, you got a dime?


Hey, Aunt Jo. It's Tony.

Can I speak to Uncle Dick?

<i>I haven't seen him today.</i>

Yeah?

Well, how's Christopher?

You know, the colic?

<i>For my money, you kids shouldn't
be drinking at your age.</i>

<i>the goddamn phone.</i>

[line disconnects]

Fuck. Hey, Joe Jerk-off.


What'd you say?

I said, hey, Joe Jerk...

Your sister's twat!

What?


[both grunting]

Stop it!

What do you got for us?

It's what I told you,
furniture. Ethan Allen.

Dinette sets
and, uh, TV trays.

TV trays?

I didn't argue.

Mmm.
Fucking truck's not gonna unload itself.

[pounding on door]

I'll let him know.

[pounding on door]

Hey, Sil, I need to talk
to my Uncle Dickie.

He's not here.

His car's here.

Battery's dead.

You know where he is?

Who am I, Rand McNally?

Okay, well...

Merry Christmas, Sil.

You too, kid.

Carmine spotted Harold,
Rockhaven Motel, down on 46th.

Well,
we'll do it tomorrow.

I'll pick you up at 10:00
at the Pork Store.

[pounding on door]

I told him you're not here.

[knocking on door]

Turn the lights out.

But the guys,
they're still unloading.

[knocking continues]

[music playing indistinctly]

[pounding on door]


You know...


[loud music playing]

The fuck are you doing?


[music stops playing]

Oh! That was a gift!

You take 'em!

I don't want
any part of this!

None of it! I don't
want any part of this!

What "this"?

What "this"?


Dick...

The kid. I don't know
what happened with you two.

But he worships you.

He's got so much potential.

Anthony, with that
loony tune of a mother.

Johnny, who's in line
for a personality transplant...

What, I'm some kind of example?
What can I tell you?

You're his best shot.

Ah, I should never
have let this happen.

Get in close.

Dick, he misses you.

What?

Nothing.

Actually...

that's it.

Nothing.

I'm not sure I follow.

Yeah, well.

Okay.

I know I shouldn't
say this, but...

Anthony, he could
end up somewhere.

Be on this thing of ours, even.

Tell him Holsten's, tomorrow.

There you go.
Let me finish, for Christ's sake!

9:00 a.m. No later.

This is good.

Okay.

It's all right, but it...
Okay!

It's over, go home.

The fuck am I doing?

This one's yours.

[silenced gunshots]

[footsteps depart]

[car door opens and closes]

[car drives away]


My God!

Mrs. Moltisanti!

Yeah?
