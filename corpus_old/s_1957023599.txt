Hey. Shh.
[crying]

Hey.

You're all better now.

You're safe.




What do you think?
The black one?

Where in the fu...
heck is your daddy?

Should we go find him?

Daddy? Where are you?


Now? Hello?

[buzzing stops]

You chose now to do this?
Oh, hey.

<i>Gordita.</i> Come to Papa.
[cries]

Even though
you shouldn't be here.

It's too dusty for you.
[crying]

Daddy's the only one who gets to
hide away in this man cave of his.

I know.

You going somewhere?

No, we are going somewhere.

Yeah, no. I'm ready.


You know what?
I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry
I forgot our date night.

Forget it.


Could you please
just not sigh?


You don't honestly expect me to believe
that you forgot your own argument

about how date night was cheaper
than therapy, do you?

Right, like you forgot we agreed your
mom wasn't allowed in our house anymore.

We're broke. I don't see you
finding a free babysitter.

[man] I would have. What?
[scoffs]

Don't start this
right now, please.

Can we just try to have fun?

We're out, okay?
Let's just try.

It's kind of cool to be out
after dark, you know?

Childless people do this all the time.
Gets dark and they go out.

All the neon lights.
It's like a fucking video game.

It's like... like <i>Tron.</i>

[both chuckle]

Hey. We're so glad you could make it.
[woman] Thanks for having us.

[man] Wow.
[woman] This place is beautiful.

Matteo and Adrienne just bought
the house down the street.

But they...
[Matteo] Thank you. Yeah.

But they can't move in
until, what, next October?

Yeah, there's this co-op
living community renting it.

It's, like, eight kids in their 20s.
It's, like, ten kids, actually.

Mm. I'm sure someone's sleeping
in the laundry room.

Ew!
It's kind of fun. Come on.

Shared space, you know.
Cooking, cleaning.

Life on the porch with a ukulele.
[man] Excuse me.

for inspection with our baby.

She was, what, like,
seven days old.

Yeah. So little...
[Matteo chuckles] We scared them shitless.

Married people with babies.
Run!

We're not married. No.

[man 1] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to assume.

No, we just... We've got the
house and the baby, and so...

Also, like, a new marriage,
whatever, it's like...

[man 2] Totally.
We wouldn't have done it, honestly,

except my family
would've killed me.

No, you mean me. They would've
cut my dick off with a machete.

Oh. [chuckles] Ow!

And I thought
Adrienne's mom hated me.

I mean, she does,
but more in a

"I'm praying to God to curse
your eternal soul" kind of way.

When she comes to the
house, we play this game

where we pretend we can't
see or hear each other.

Very pleasant.

Okay, excuse me.

Liam?

Hey!
Hey!

How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

I haven't seen you here in so long.

I guess now I know
why you wanted to come so badly.

I had no idea that
he was going to be there, okay?

And God forbid I have friends.
You certainly have friends, right?

You know,
we both deserve to be happy.


I didn't say that.
Are you happy?

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Oh, that's convincing.

We agreed not to do anything
crazy in the first year.

We just have to get through
the first year.

I don't want to just get through it.
I want to enjoy it.

You want to control it.
What choice do I have?

I'm dragging you
through the motions of our life.

Your life. You wanted to have a
baby, we had a baby.

You wanted a house, we bought the house.
What now?

How about the truth?

[scoffs] Don't.
You can't do it.

No, you want me to make up
some pretend confession

to justify your paranoia,
and I won't do that.

Yeah, right.

be happy till you're miserable.

Honestly, I do not know what the point is.

Of life?

Of us. Why are we
even together anymore?

[Matteo scoffs]

We...

We have a newborn baby.
We just closed escrow. What?

Now what?
You want to split up?

I want to...

[fluid dripping]


[sirens wailing]

[Matteo, distorted]
<i>All these neon lights...</i>

<i>It's like a video game.</i>

[EMT] <i>Can you hear me? Can you hear me?</i>
[machine beeping]

[Adrienne, distorted] <i>You know,
we both deserve to be happy.</i>

[baby crying]



[breathing continues]

<i>Time of death: 12:34 a.m.</i>

[indistinct voices]

[homeless man]
Chica! Please don't!

Chica!


We'll give you a minute.

No!

Wait.




[TV host] <i>Is there something beyond
all this? Is there an afterlife?</i>

<i>Today on our show,
we'll seek answers to those questions.</i>

<i>Our first guest
was rushed to the hospital...</i>

[cheerful music playing on toy]

Ellie.

Ellie.

Look at Mommy, baby.

Ellie.

Ellie.

Ellie, look at Mama.
[woman on TV] <i>I remember one minute being in this world</i>

<i>and the next minute
being, like, I died.</i>

[Ellie coos]

[bell tolls]

I miss her so much.

Maggie?

I can't believe she's gone.
I know.

That's in my face.
Sorry. I'm quitting.

I just can't lose you.

Come here.

Thank you all for being here.

[speaking Spanish]

Okay.

"To everything
there is a season...

and a time to every purpose
under the heavens...

a time to be born...

and a time to die."

I'm sorry.

This feels so unreal.

Like a mistake, you know?

Like I could reach into the hourglass and
stir the sands and just change it all.


No, I'm sorry. I...

I can't do this. Sorry.

Sorry.

Poor thing.

I'm gonna go check on him.

[priest] "Love is patient, love is kind."
Shea!

"It does not envy, it does not boast."
Shea!

Let's let the body
cool off first, okay?

[Adrienne's mom]
It's better this way.

My sweet girl. See all the toys.
[Ellie babbles]

Yeah! So many pretty toys.

See, this is Ellie's room now,

and we're gonna do
just great. Mm.

Aw.

Ellie Bellie, you're gonna live
with Grandma and Grandpa now.

[sings lullaby]

Look at you.

Grandma?
Hmm?

Do you really think
she loved my dad?

Are those my journals? Oh, God, no. Fuck.
Don't... Please don't look at those.

[Adrienne's mom] I think
your dad was hard to love.


Stop now.

It's not your fault
your father left.

Now, tears won't solve anything.
They won't bring him back.

Bring him back
from where?

Where is your dad?
Where the shit is your dad?


Hey! Adrienne!

Come down.
What are you doing?

You can see me.

What?

I died.

I died, Matteo.
Okay.

It's so wrong that that was it.
It was just headlights and a half gasp...

Stop. Stop.

You're confused.
We had an accident.

Oh, my God,
you're dead too.

What? No!

No, I'm not.

And you're not.

How do you know?

Because I know.

Well, because we're here.

I mean, spending eternity
on the 10 Freeway...

What did we do
to deserve that?

You weren't there with Ellie.

Where do you go?

What happens to you? You just get scared
and then, what, you just... you disappear?

You concussed. That's it.

No. I'm dead.

I could step into traffic now. It wouldn't matter.
Hey!

[tires screech]

Hey.

It's okay.

What is this, like, purgatory?
What's happening to me?

Just hold on to me. Hmm?

[Ellie babbling]

[Ellie crying]

[Adrienne's mom] We just want
what's best for Ellie.

We can't leave her here, Steve.

just left instructions

for what she would've wanted
in a situation like this.

[Adrienne's mom] She would
want us to take care of Ellie.

What about Matteo?

God forgive me,
but this is all his fault.

He couldn't take care of her.
He wouldn't marry her.

He couldn't protect her,
and now she's...

should get ahead of ourselves.

[Adrienne's mom]
We should take the baby home.


[screams, panting]
Shit!

What? What happened?

There was somebody outside.
I thought I saw some...

Outside? It was me.
I was outside.

The door was locked.
I had to go around the house.

Hey.

I don't know how much time
I have left here, Matteo.

Well, none of us do, right?

It's part of the mystery.

I heard them talking.
They're gonna take Ellie.

Who said...
My mother.

I just heard them.
[scoffs]

I'm perfectly capable of taking
care of my family, Patty.

Thank you very much.

As if it was my fault.

Hey. We got
to get you better, okay?

But no one is taking our baby.
Okay?

Hey. Come.

Come, come.

It will take a pack of wolves more rabid than
your mother to take her away. All right?

Do we even have a baby?

What?
The baby was in the car,

but the car seat was emp...

Hey. You...
Maybe I just imagined that we have a baby.

You... You didn't want
to have a baby.

We have a baby.
Ellie is our baby.

She's six months old,
kinda cute.

Remember when she was born,
that she couldn't latch?

We were freaking out.

And then these researchers
from Denmark came.

Remember what he said?

"We're doing a study on the
benefits of..." Of what?

Of narrative therapy
for new mothers and newborns.

You've been through
a traumatic experience,

but you've been able to process
by talking through it.

The birth was traumatic for you,

but you've been able to talk
about it with your husband.

Boyfriend.

Sorry?
Nothing. Nothing.

Right. But the baby,
she has no idea what has happened.

She needs to process too.

You need to tell her
her story.

Um, okay.

Hey.

We had kind of
a crazy birth, huh?

It was hard,
and it was painful...

because the cord
was wrapped around you

and you couldn't breathe.


And then all these people rushed in,
and it was bright, and it was loud,

but those people
were helping you.

You weren't alone.

And we were there
the whole time.

We were just not breathing
with you for those 90 seconds...

and then you did.

You breathed.

And I know you're so tired
from all that craziness,

but you're all better now.

You're safe.

But, my baby, you've got to eat.




You see?

Remember, we have a baby.

I'm gonna help you make sense
of everything else.

I'm gonna...
I'm gonna tell you our story, okay?

That way you can know
that you're okay.

You can know you're safe.

What if you're wrong?

What if it's a sad story?

[knocking]
No.

It's not.
[Patty] Sorry to wake you.

One second, Patty.

You need anything?

Tell her you're fine, please.

I'm not even here.

So she's talking to a dead girl?

To you.

Okay.

Okay, so you won't talk
to anyone for a bit. Okay?

We'll stay here,
and we'll figure this out ourselves.

I did some laundry,

and I was thinking
I'd make soup tonight.

I have to go to the store,
so if you want anything...

Thank you. Take your time.

Okay, let's stay in bed.

One step at a time. Hey.

Shall we start
from the beginning?

Of time?

Of us.

Fine.

If it means you'll stay,
then fine.

I will stay.
Close your eyes.

[Adrienne] Where are we? What is it?
[Maggie] Okay, this way.

Okay, all right, stop. Stop. Stop.
I don't like it.

I don't want it.
Okay, one, two, three.


[man] Yeah!
[pop music playing]

[both laugh]

Oh, my God, you guys,
this is awesome.


Hey!

What is this?

I was so uncomfortable
in the spotlight.

Hi!
And I thought that was so cute.

All these people are here
because they love you so much.

Look, and there's
so many snacks.

[laughter, chattering]

[pop music continues]



I remember you blushed.

No, I didn't.

Okay.
What? I didn't.

I lured you in with my boyish charm.
That's what I did.


Oh, yeah, this one. Shia. Sean?

Come on. You remember her name.

Shea.

She was always just so much.

She never really talked to me
after we got together.

She talked to you.

I told you nothing happened
with Shea.

Yeah, you did tell me that.

[Ellie crying]

Shea got me a job
in a hotel in Palm Springs.

All the woodwork and doors.

With her?
Just two months.

[footsteps departing]
[door unlocking]

[door closes]


I haven't finished
with the night we met.

[laughter, chattering]

You remember what
we talked about?

[soft, slow music playing]

Hmm. Movies?
<i>Aliens.</i>

My love of show tunes.

Yes, and yet,
I kept talking to you.

You love Toni Morrison.

And I wanted to give you
a blow job right there.

What? No.

No way.
Way.

Fuck, I wish I knew.
[chuckles]

You were focused on me so intently
like we were the only ones there.

And you told me about your stepdad.
Not that night.

No, you did.
About the last time that you saw him.

Oh, yeah. I was ten.

He had his hands
around my mom's neck,

so I called the cops,
and of course he denied it.

Then my mom blamed me
when he left.

I'm sorry.

[scoffs, chuckles] No, I'm sorry.
What a downer.

[both chuckle]

My parents are a pain, but not painful
enough that I can get rid of them.

That's too bad.

I mean...
No, I mean, that's good.

It's good, I guess.

Anyway...
Cheers.

You can spend the night in my room
if you promise to, um, not molest me.

No, wait. That was weeks later.
I remember.

You asked to crash on my couch.

What time's your meeting in the morning?
It's at 9:00.

Thank you
for letting me stay.

It's just that traffic in the morning,
it's crazy heading this way, so...

I thought
it would be easier.

Yeah, no worries.
It's fine.

You know,
I lied about the meeting.

There was no meeting.

I know.

[soft music playing]

[both chuckle]

It was almost dawn.

I thought you were
never gonna kiss me.

Oh! [chuckles]
I tri... [chuckles] I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Come back.
Come back. Come back. Please.

[both chuckling]

Mm. I'm sorry.


Make love to me.

You got a condom?

Don't you?
No.


What? You light...
Are you serious?

I mean, you light a hundred
candles, and you have no condom?

I thought you'd have one.
I'm sorry.

No. What kind of feminist are you?
[both laugh]

Wait.

Bam. [chuckles]

Thank God we don't use
these fucking things anymore.

Yeah, because
we don't have sex anymore.

No, I'm sorry. Shh, shh.

Let's... Let's not think
about that. Focus.

Do you smell smoke?

[speaking Spanish]

Fire!


Matteo!

Matteo!

[coughs, panting]

You just left me there.

You just left me there to die.

That's not what happened.

I came back.
I came back and put it out.

I saved the day.
I was fucking Superman that night.

We laughed about this.
Yeah.

Hey. Hey.

I love you.

No, I was the one
that said it first.

Does it matter?
Yes.

No. I don't know.



[breathing heavily]

There you are.

Hey. You scared me.

I'm a good ghost.

You promised you'd stay
with me.

I've been doing
some research.

It's kind of crazy what happens
to people after trauma.

I mean, what they
experience, you know?

Makes sense
that you feel off.

Off?
Yeah.

What do you think happens
when you die?

Nothing.
What if it's bad?

Painful, some extension or manifestation
of your fears and your failings?

Hey.
Of your last moments, again and again and again and again?

No. No, no.
Uh, wait.

It can't just be an insular
emotional repetition.

I mean,
if it's not nothing,

it's gotta be something bigger
than that, right?

We're space dust. Right?

So we just go back to that,
to be part of everything.

The water, the trees.
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

get Catholic about it, yeah.

When you die, Adrienne...
but you're not dead yet.

I think I'm here to get you to
step up and take care of Ellie.

We talked about this.
I saw it, and you weren't there.

Hey, stop it.
I saw her, and you weren't there.

So maybe you were lying,
and that's why I'm stuck here.

I wouldn't lie about that. Wait.
And that's why I'm still here.

No.

I know you're always the fixer,
always in control, but...

you gotta trust me
on this one. Hmm?

When I go,
you'll be a good dad.

You're gonna learn to braid hair...
Hey, stop.

...and sing lullabies.
Okay.

She's gonna need you.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Let's talk about
what's real.

What really happened.

Okay?

Mexico. A happy memory.


It's okay.
Don't.

It's okay.

[boat captain speaking Spanish]

[waves lapping]

[Adrienne] I just met your family.
[Matteo] Uh-huh.

They loved you.

I'm so glad you made us
do this trip.

You were always glad afterwards.

Well, how could I ever imagine
it was going to be so...

Magical.
It was.

I could see our whole life,
just this...

beautiful adventure
carved out on the horizon.

You made me rethink everything I
thought I knew about what I wanted.

Will they come?

Yeah, they're coming.

Here!

[Adrienne screams]
Whoa! Wow!

Yay!

[Matteo chuckles]

[Adrienne] Right here! Right here! Right here!
[Matteo] Wow!

[Adrienne] There!
[Matteo laughs]


And then we died...

<i>Hostel: Mexico,</i> straight to DVD.
[chuckles]

I have told this story so many times,
it's almost like it's a fantasy.

This was real. This is real.

in this place forever.

I so wanted you to propose.

I was going to.

What?
Yeah.

I even looked at rings
and everything, but...

I thought you'd be mad.
I didn't have a ring.

No, I wouldn't have.
I wouldn't have been mad.

Yes, you would.

[scoffs]
Hey. Hey.

Okay, I didn't propose,
but you remember what I said?

I want to kiss you at the end of
every day for the rest of my life.

One for yesterday...

one for today...

one for tomorrow.


It's so sad that we fell
apart, isn't it?

Yeah.

[Matteo] What's wrong?
What's happening?

What's happening?
Hey.

Adrienne. What's wrong?
[gasps]

What's happening?

[groaning]
Adrienne, take a breath.

[groaning]
Adrienne, take a breath.

Adrienne!
[gasps]

Okay. Breathe. Breathe.
[groans, breathes heavily]

Breathe. Breathe.
[breathes heavily]

Breathe. Adrienne, breathe.

Okay. You're okay.

You're okay.

You keep saying that,
but clearly...

What's wrong?
[groaning]

The water... You didn't see the water.
What?


Just breathe, please.
Breathe. You're okay.

Look me in the eyes.

There you go.
That works.


Okay. Okay.

Let me get you a towel.
You'll be fine.

Okay? Don't move.

[breathes heavily]

[male voice]
<i>It's over now.</i>

<i>Where's the baby?</i>

No. No, you can't have her.

Ellie?

Ellie!

Please!
Somebody help me!

Help me!

Somebody help me!

Adrienne!

She's not breathing!
What is it? Stop it. Stop it.

[Ellie crying]
Let Mama have the baby.

You're gonna hurt her. Steve!
[Matteo] What happened?

Let go. Let the baby go.

Oh...
He can't have her! He can't have her!

[Steve] Is she okay?
[Matteo] She's fine.

She's okay. She's okay.
[Steve] It's okay.

what's going on?

He's coming...
He's coming for her.


He's coming for her.
What? What's coming?

What are you talking about?
Dea...

Death.


you've been experiencing

some confusion
since the accident.

Are you in any pain?

Does that hurt?
I don't know.

Adrienne, can you hear me?

Do you know what day it is?

Sorry, I'm not really here.

Which one is it?

She just needs her medicine.


Take two pills,
three times a day...


She's gonna be okay.
She's a strong girl.

I do appreciate it.

[Ellie crying]

Ellie wanted to say hi.
Why don't you give her a hug?

Okay, here,
I'll take her.

pills, I can't even keep them straight.

you, okay? Just so you know.

We don't even have to talk.

She has physical therapy,

and an appointment with a
psychiatrist on Tuesday.

if she needs anything. She'll be fine.

for a while, and Steve will stay with her.

[babbling]
[crashing sounds]

Children need stability, and this just
is not a good environment for her.

[insurance agent]
So, the good news is,

the other driver was at fault,
per the police report.

Is he okay?
He isn't claiming any injuries.

Will you be taking
Matteo's statement separately

to make sure we're telling the truth?
Because it was not his fault.

No matter what
my mother may have told you.

There was a witness who said he saw the
other driver gun through the yellow.

Do you remember that?

Adrienne?

[zombies grunting]
[woman screams]

Zombies?

You hate zombies.

They're my people now.

I feel really connected
to them, actually.

They're very misunderstood.

I... [exhales]

I know there's
something wrong with me.

Yeah.

But you're gonna get better.

If I was actually a zombie,

would you tie me up
and keep me in your garage?

[scoffs, chuckles]

Yeah, I guess so.

I've been always afraid
of losing you, so, yeah.

Because you knew you would?

Adrienne...

doesn't it make sense, right...

that you're alive?

That people can see you?
They talk to you.

You are here.

But I feel soulless.

Hollowed out.

Do you remember when we realized
we were having a baby?

Please don't.

You keep trying to prove that I'm
okay, but I can prove I'm not.

Can I tell you something?

Yeah.
I knew I was gonna die.

What do you mean?

She told me, when we went to the
house to look at the broken window.


I'm gonna check the window.

Hi.
[young woman] Hey, welcome.

Hey! How are you?
[young woman] Hey!

What are you guys doing?
A reading.

Oh, yeah?
I'm an assistant to Psychic Elaine.

She's, like, the best in LA,
like, the real, real deal.

Like, not a storefront, like,
otherworldly, and I'm studying under her.

Wow.

You want me
to do a reading on you?

Sure, why not?
I can get you later.

Just don't tell me I feel old
because I think that much is obvious.


Weird,
your lifeline's really short.

What?

I mean, it doesn't
necessarily mean death.

It could be like...
like you're not living,

like you're not living life
to the fullest.

Um... Or I could be
doing it wrong.

No. Yes, it's crazy.
I'm... It's true.

I'm dead.

I die in a car accident,
two weeks after this.

Whoa. That is crazy.

We'll never get to move into this house.
It sucks.

But if you knew,
why did you let yourself get into the car?

Did you want to die?

I don't know. I...

This is grasping
at straws, Adrienne.

It's coincidence.

That's what you said to her,
but then...

How old were you
when your mother died?

What...

Did-Did-Did you tell her?
No, I swear I didn't.

He was 17.

She's lingering for you.

There's something
unresolved.

She says she wishes
that you spoke at her funeral.

[scoffs]
That's it.


Okay. That's our cue
to go. Sorry.

You never told me. Was that true?
Ye... No.

Well, yes. Yes.
Yes, it was true.

I was young.
I didn't know what to say.

I was mad at her,
but that doesn't prove

that she's psychic
or that you're dead.

I kept asking myself again and
again, what is the point of life?

Of us. You kept asking yourself
what's the point of us.

But then when I left Gary and Kevin's
that night, I had a really bad feeling.


Hey!
I had this feeling

like everything
was falling apart.


You were pissed at me.
If we hadn't bought the house,

none of this would've happened.
What? It could've been a plane crash.

It's my fault.
Stop trying to find meaning

in something meaningless
and random.

You didn't cause
the accident.

If there's someone to blame,
it's me. Yeah.

I wanted to go out that night, so we did.
I didn't see the guy coming.

No, no, no. I didn't see the guy coming.
I wanted to stay late.

Hey, stop hijacking this.
Let me finish the story.

I don't want you to finish your story.
I want you to tell the truth.

You want the truth?
Yes!

Fine.
It wasn't all good.

Do you remember
that work event?

You had just gotten your job
doing grunt work at the museum.

Oh, my God. Grunt work?

I'm managing major design installations.
This is not grunt work.

I don't know
why you took it.

Well, aside from the fact
that it's my dream job,

some people actually have
to work for a living,

so that they can support their
family, so they can buy a house.

Okay, yeah?
Thank you.

Have piles of shit, right?
Thank you.

You don't want things?
You don't want tools and tech toys

and whatever other shit it is you
get shipped direct to your garage?

Okay, I'm just saying that
if we stay in the apartment,

we have a low rent, we keep some freedom,
and we're not tied to a mortgage.

If you're never tied to anything,
then you'll never be free.

What musical is that from?

It's from <i>Pippin.</i> It doesn't...
[laughs]

Doesn't mean that
it's not true.

What about this beautiful
adventure we're on?

You're going to be working
from 9:00 to 9:00 every day.

Gonna be laden with kids, the
house, with no time to go anywhere.

Not everyone can not finish
school and not get a real job...

I have a real job.
...and not care.

I have a real job.
This is what I want.

If you don't want it too,
you should just... get out of my way.

See?

Where do you go?

[Liam] Adrienne.
Hey! How are you?

I'm good. Champagne?

Mind reader. Thank you.

The look in your eyes. So alive.

He is a work colleague,
and he's on the board.

I am supposed to be nice to him.
Thank you.

For what?
For making this event worth attending.

I'm... Yeah. Frida Kahlo and Maya
Deren in one space? Be still, my heart.

focused on the art, but I just can't.

Why?
You're distracting me.

I just... I threw on...

like, frazzled, like,
whatever work thing.

Don't underestimate
yourself.

Okay, fine. Fine. You saw that.
So what? So what?

I'm sorry. Matteo is trying
to prove that I'm alive

by making me feel,
what, like, guilty? Thanks.

He invited me
to check out his woodworking.

The same night?
Yeah, I think so.

I bought a bench.

[Matteo laughs]
[Liam] Oh!

Here it comes.
Such terror.

You told me it was
referred by a friend.

that fast?

I didn't even know
you guys knew each other.

Hmm. So you lied.

Now you know the truth.
Feel better?

I'm just saying,
most guys would punch a guy

who was making moves
on their girlfriend.

You wanted me to punch him?

He's got six inches on me.
No way.

Why didn't you just tell me
you were jealous?

I didn't think
I could do anything about it.

I mean, probably delay it.
Did I?

I didn't cheat on you.

Did you want to?
It doesn't matter.

It matters.
It fucking matters.

[Ellie crying]

Bullshit! Bullshit!
That... That never happened.

Okay. Look me in the eye
and tell me I am making this up.

You live so in your head.
You exaggerate things.

You conflate things.
Stop lying to me.

Stop ignoring...
Stop disappearing on me.

On our baby.

Even me dying isn't enough
to get you to step up.

It's so unfair you expect me
to fail.

You can't pretend to know
what's going to happen,

how I would feel
if I lost you.

What fucking living hell
that would be for me.

Maybe I would never recover.

Maybe I would be no good
for Ellie.

Maybe I would break
if I lost you.

[doorbell rings]

Who is that?

I'm gonna check.

How you holding up?

Hello, Father Richard.

Proof that I'm dead.

Richard if the milk is past its due date.

Adrienne, I'm planning a
bingo night at the church.

What are you doing?

I'm trying...
I'm trying to work out

what to be buried in.
What?

This one actually
doesn't zip up at the back,

but if you leave it unzipped,
I don't think anybody's gonna notice.

Slow down.
Actually,

I think I would rather be
scattered somewhere beautiful.

Oh, okay.

You have a second chance, Matteo,
and you've just got to move on.

[scoffs]
And you gotta find somebody that you love.

Not Shea.
Please don't marry Shea.


Somebody... Somebody educated
and somebody funny.

Find somebody funny
and just love them.

And let them love you.
It's gonna be weird

to bring a girl with my dead
girlfriend still in my bed, right?

And I want my funeral to be fun.
Not in a church, please.

Okay.
No matter what my mother says.

We'll have a dance-pop
party funeral.

You're the one
who likes pop music.

I don't like pop music.
I want Missy Elliott.

Okay, we'll have a bunch of
geriatrics dancing to Missy Elliott.

Man, life.

Perfect.
What a tricky little minx.

Hey, stop. Stop!

Stop!

Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

What the fuck are you doing?

You don't get
to be dead yet, okay?

Fuck. So impatient.

Adrienne.

Hey.

Look at me.
So impatient.

Shh, shh.

Even having kids.
You remember it? Last year.

<i>DÃ­a de Muertos.</i>

Stay with me.

I know you remember.


[man 1] Yeah.
[man 2] Okay.

I'd be down.
[man 1] Can we get two of those, please?

Okay, I gotta say this quick.
Uh, A wants a baby.

What?
Here is a cute...

She's gonna break up with you if
you don't pull the goalie right now.

What the...
We just started talking about this.

He shouldn't
have told you that.

She said she was going to
poke a hole in her diaphragm.

I was kidding.

I was kidding,
obviously.

Okay, it didn't sound like
you were kidding.

Maggie.
I'm just being honest.

Okay, she was upset,
and I talked her down.

So impatient.

I'm just asking you to be
patient with me, with us.

May I finish the story?
Okay, sure.

I remember what else
happened that day.

Fucking Matteo!

Hi! You said
you were out of town.

Uh...
[chuckles]

No. No. Um...

The-The trip got canceled.
Oh...

It's so funny that Shea would know
about a trip of yours that got canceled,

'cause you guys don't talk.
This is not why I brought this memory up.

Hey!
Shea.

Hi! Wow, you look so great.
Hi. So do you, always.

How are you guys?
[Adrienne] Great.

Yeah? Are you married yet?
[Matteo] Uh-huh.

Oh, God, no.

No, I cannot bear the idea
of letting this oaf own me,

but it's so great that you guys still
talk, that you kept in touch.

Even though you swore to me that you
didn't talk to her anymore. Liar.

Of course. I'm sorry we haven't talked.
That's so...

That's stupid. It's so stupid.
No, totally. Right, right.

We should have lunch. Lie.

Totally.
Lie.

Hey, are you still,
um, woodworking?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh.

Amazing, because my dad
just bought this huge property.

So I actually, um...
I might have a job for you.

Oh, really?
Yeah.

That's so sweet.
Yeah.

This was the beginning
of the end, wasn't it?

What? No, no, no, no.
Cool, so, um...

[speaking Spanish]

It was so good
to see you, girl.

[chuckles]
[chuckles]

Hey. Bye.

I love you.



Why don't you just be
with Shea, Matteo?

Are you crazy?
If I wanted to be with her, I would be.

Is that a threat?
No, I'm just saying, I'm with you.

God, I was so much, wasn't I?

No. We made up, didn't we?

Did we?
Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. This...

This wasn't the beginning
of the end.

This was the moment when we...

when I told you...

Hey.

I wanna have babies
with you, okay?

I wanna have a kid.

Let's have a baby.

You only agreed because I threatened
to leave you if you didn't.

Okay, yeah,
but I still agreed. Right?

Because I wanted to.

You're right. Let's do it.

No, what's wrong?

I'm so glad you said yes.

And I'm so glad
we had Ellie.

Hey, what's wrong?
I said yes, right?

Hey.

Adrienne.
He's here.

Who's here?

Adrienne.

Hey.

Adrienne, talk to me.

Adrienne, wake up. Hey!

Hey, wake up.

Adrienne.

Adrienne, wake up.
Adrienne, wake up.

Wake up!

Fuck. Don't do that
to me, please.

I don't know
how to help you.

This is bigger than me.

You saw it.

No, I didn't see anything.

Let's get you out
of this thing.

I give up.

I can't do this anymore.

Wait.

Okay.

I guess
I'll go avoid your mom.

[footsteps departing]

[door opens, closes]

[sirens wailing]

[breathing heavily]

Hey.


I can't.

You can't help me.

What if you're wrong?

Adrienne.

You want this to be the truth Ellie
has to live with her whole life?

Don't talk to me about truth.

You were right about Shea.

What you saw.

[Ellie crying]

Look, it's a job,
a well-paid job.

We can't afford to both take time off.
[mumbles]

No, you look, Matteo.

You brought this baby
into the world, a bastard.

Mom.
Well, she is. You did that.

It's the truth.

And now you turn your back
on her?

Look, Patty,
go fuck yourself. Okay?

Matteo!
What?

You're gonna defend her crap?
Mom. Mom.

Please...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adrienne.

I can't be around this.

Thank fucking God!

Are you kidding me?

That was the only help I had,
the only person I had.

Please,
stop being dramatic, okay?

Me?

You're the one who left.
You're the one who couldn't handle it.

And I stood there forever
just hoping you would come back.

Slow down, or you're going
to get in an accident.

I didn't.
I just needed an escape.

I was afraid of being
like my stepfather.

Of family, of all of it.

All my life trying
to avoid becoming that man,

and here I am,
just turning into him.

You're not him.
You're nothing like him.

And when I got back to you,
I swear, nothing happened

because I was afraid
you would...

I was afraid
I would lose you if I told you.

Tell me now.



[both speaking Spanish]

[romantic pop music playing]

And then...

And then what?

And then, I stopped.

Because I felt like
you were there.

Like you were right there.

And I couldn't be anything
but yours.

It was never clearer to me.

I was just so ashamed of lying
and of failing.

I should have been honest
about feeling overwhelmed.

I should have stayed.

I should have stood up for you
with my mom. I just...

No wonder you left.

I just made it so hard for you to love me.
No.

I was always tearing it down
and pulling you apart.

No.

Liar.

We just had so little time.

[heart beating]
[tires screeching]


I should have loved you better.

We still have time.

We just got to hold on to it.

Even if it gets messy
and hard.

Take the good and the bad.

For better or worse.

Give me your hand.

Give me your hand.

Please.

Do you remember the day
we got married?

What?

Marry me.

It's too late.

No. No, no, no.

Just say yes.

Marry me.

Yes.

<i>Adrienne,
you are my best friend.</i>

<i>Matteo,
you are my calm and my truth.</i>

<i>My strength, my compass.</i>

the patience that love demands.</i>

<i>I promise to be always yours.</i>

<i>You know I don't believe
in soul mates, but...</i>

I married you
the minute I met you.

And loving you is the closest
thing to faith I've ever known.

I promise to love you
and let you love me.

I promise to always be the
person who earns your love.

I... that one.


I give you my hand.

I give you my hand.

And I give you my heart.

I give you my heart.

From this day forward...

From this day forward
for the rest of our lives.

For the rest of our lives.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.


And one for tomorrow.

[slow romantic music playing]

You see, I'm dancing.
I can't believe it.

Will wonders never cease?

Even the she-beast is happy.

Now I know it's a dream.

You know how I feel?
Hmm?

Alive.

Really?
Yeah.

[laughs]
[inhales]

Oh, say it again.
Say it again.

I feel alive.

You are alive, so alive.

It makes sense.
My ribs are killing me.

[laughs] I'm sorry.
Stop pressing on them.

I'm sorry.
[laughing]

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ow.

Thank God for seat belts.

I'm so happy you were right.

Can you say that again?
What?

The-The part where I'm right.
Oh. [laughs]

You were right! You're right!
[chuckles]

I'm so grateful.

I'm so lucky.

Me too.

Hello, baby.

You're so strong.

You're so strong.
[Patty] You gave us quite a scare, you know.

I'm feeling better now.
Well, you're a strong girl too.

You know,
Matteo really helped me.

I know he doesn't share your beliefs,
but he's a pretty extraordinary person.

I don't want to speak...
Can we not do this right now?

I'm just saying that there is no reason
why he couldn't take care of Ellie

on his own if he needed to.

You don't have to attack me.
I'm not attacking you.

Adrienne.
[Patty] Maggie.

Maggie.
Needs to get changed anyhow.

Come on, baby.
Hi.

Oh, my gosh.

Think you're still in shock?

You know,
I actually thought I was dead.

Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.
Dead.

I just feel really raw.

Yeah, that's totally normal.

You know what? I'm here for you, okay?
Whatever you need.

Right now, we have to get you dressed
because you have a doctor's appointment.

Okay, Mom.

<i>This is Matteo. Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

Hey, where'd you go?
We should be home by...

Sorry. Home by 2:00. Call me.

How are you feeling?

Like I don't want
to be in a car.

with Maggie, and I just...

I'm glad that you have her
to process with.

Yeah, she's amazing.

I'm not good at these things.

That's okay. That's okay.

I haven't known what to say.

I've been trying to find the
words, but I...

I cook and I clean,
and that's what I can do.

It's okay, Mom. I'm okay.

Got to take the good with the bad, right?
That's life.

For better or worse.

I am just... I'm just so sorry.

As a parent, all you want to do
is protect your children.

[breathing heavily]

[fluid dripping]

I feel this for you,

the same way
that you will feel Ellie's pain.

What?

Stop. Stop the car.

[Steve] Jesus! Adrienne, what are you doing?
Honey! Adrienne!


[horns honking]

[chattering]
[woman speaking Spanish]

[tires screeching]

[groans]
[rattling]



Hey. It's over now. Okay?
I'm going to get you out of here.

[Adrienne groans]

Is the baby in the car? Where's the baby?
Hey, where's the baby?

Come on.

[homeless man grunts]
[Adrienne groans]

[horns honking]

I know you.

You're the lady whose husband
died in that accident.

What?

What did you just say?

[homeless man] Hey.
[gasping]

Hey, are you okay?

I can't breathe.

I can't breathe.

[groaning]
[homeless man] Sit down. Hey.

I can't breathe.

[EMT 1] Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

Where's Matteo?
Where's Matteo?

[EMT 2] Breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe.
[groaning]

You're okay. Breathe. It's okay.
Just breathe. Just relax. Relax.


[breathing heavily, groaning]

Hey, sit down.

Sit down...

You took him!
What?

You... You took him!
What? No!

You took him!
[grunts]

I tried to save him, okay?
I'm sorry.

It was...
He was already gone.

No. [sobbing]

Hey! Hey!

No!

Adrienne, come here.
I'm sorry.

No, no. no.
Come here. Come on.

It's all right.

[Adrienne sobbing]
[Steve] Don't worry.

There you go.
Be careful.

There we go. There we go.
We'll go home. We'll go home.


How did it go?

Adrienne?

Adrienne?

Adrienne.
[sniffles]

Please don't...
don't touch me.

Slow down. Okay?
Honey.

It's okay.

What?

I had him.

He was right here.
I had him in my bed.

He was right here. He was in my...
[Patty] Oh, honey.

I was the one that got hurt.
He was fine. He was fine.

Should I call Father Richard?

Just get him to bring him back.
Can he bring him back, please? [crying]

I need him to come back.
Please, Mom.


Can I have a minute, Mom?

I'll be right here if you need me, okay?

You just...

You just rest.

[door closes]

Come back to me.

Come back to me.

Come back to me.

[Ellie crying]

<i>Nurse practitioner Ramon to the
Family Birth Center, Room 4, please.</i>

[Ellie crying]

She's still sleeping.

Are you ready to eat?

She hasn't had anything.

I mean, they gave her
some sugar water IV,

but she's mostly sleeping
on and off.

Come here.


Shh, shh. [sniffles]


[Ellie giggling]
Whoosh!

Come for a walk.
[clicking tongue]

Look.

It's Daddy's chair.
Should we have a rock?



What do you think?
The black one?

What are you doing,
you little monkey?

Blow a kiss.

Matteo was unassuming.

He was kind and good.

If he was here now,

he would tell you that there's
no reason for this, no purpose.

Except what we make of it.

Mommy, I'm up. I'm up.

I'm awake.
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.


I'm up.
I know.

Yoink.

Come here, munchkin. Come here.
[giggling, babbling]

T-bear.

[laughs]
[knocking]

I'll get it. I can do it.
I can do it. I can do it.

Okay. See who it is.
