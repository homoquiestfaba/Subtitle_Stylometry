It was like... it was like
the end of the world, you know?

It was like...

A whole other time.

A major disaster... manmade.

A catastrophe!

You know what I'm saying?

I mean, that was
devastation, you know?

The violence...

The destruction...

The terror.

I mean, that was something.

I mean...

I have never
seen a movie like that.

Crowd: No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

Smith: You know,
the question we're asking

is if anything has changed
because of the riots.

I think
it didn't get any better.

Smith: All right,
now what about the riots?

There was attention
paid to the riots.

Was there enough attention
paid to the riots?

You... you had to pay attention.

No matter where you lived.

Smith: Do you think we need
any more social change?

Man: Do we need change? Yeah.

Oh, of course!

We only got
little bitty changes.

All: Justice!

Man: The Rodney king incident

had nothing to do with race.

They burned my place out.

It's on!

Revolution is today, money.

Bump all the.

No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

Man: 13,000 square feet

of building, all gone.
Smith: Wow.

Man:
Uh, this country told the world

that it was the great
melting pot, and in my eyes

it's a boiling pot
waiting to erupt.

Smith: Oh, you
can repeat whatever I say.

I will tell you exactly.

Um, let's see, April the 29th...

Was that a Wednesday
or a Thursday?

Did you hear what happened to me.
Did you hear what happened to me

because of
the Beverly hills hotel?

I don't know if you know this,
but I do a lot of publicity.

I've been on television,
I do shows on real estate

I do shows on silicone.

I've been on "60 minutes,"
they called me to Washington...

I had 36 surgeries.

I had silicone injections
and 36 surgeries on my face.

And so, um... I'm diversing.

And I was married to gig young
and there was a big scandal

and so they wrote
a book about it

and they called me
to interview me for that.

So... when they call me
to interview me

I never know
what it's going to be for

whether it's going to be real
estate, which I love to do...

Silicone I do
to help other people.

I was such a victim.

I was paralyzed for a year.

My face was like this,
my eye was like that.

They went in

and removed a grapefruit-sized
silicone from my face

went in and drilled
a hole into my head

to put bone marrow in.

I had 15 surgeries on this eye.

This was an 18-hour surgery.

I almost died.

And so I said,

"well, what can I give back
to the world because of what?"

All I had
was silicone injections

to give me cheekbones,
nothing more.

You'll read the story.

And so I decided that I would do
interviews to keep women and men

from having silicone injected
into their bodies.

It belongs in cars.

And so I'd been on this crusade
in between my work

and so I do a lot of interviews

um, a lot of television...
Pretty good.

But when they called me
to interview me...

When the hotel closed,
it just didn't come out right.

Well, I mean, you know how
they take things out of context.

And so, um...

Maybe I should back...
Back and lead up

and explain why
I was so frightened

and why I said what I said.

On the day of the riot

we were sitting here safe
and sound in Beverly hills

because it started slowly
and building.

All of a sudden
we hear people screaming.

Look out the window,
we see smoke!

Smith: I grew up

with all this rich stuff
at home.

And then when I went to school

they started telling me
I was inferior...

Because I was Mexican.

So I knew from an early age

that I had an enemy,
and that enemy

was those nice, white teachers.

And I always wondered,
why did I have this...

This madness in me,
that I understood this.

And it's not an enemy
that I hated

you know,
it's not a hate thing.

But the insanity
that I carry with me,

it started when I took
that beating from the police.

In 1942, when I was in my teens

I was running around
as a zoot-suiter

and the cops
beat me up bad, you know?

So, uh, well, I don't know.

One of them said something
about my mama or something,

and so I threw a punch
at one of them.

And, uh...

That sealed my doom,
that sealed my doom.

Four cops took me into a room
and locked the door.

They started
kicking me in the head,

and the kicks in the head
were so bad

that they fractured my eardrums.

I was deaf on both ears
worse than I am now.

And from that day...

I had a hate in me.

And even now, it's... it's...
It's... it's... it's awful.

It's... it's...
It's... it's awful.

If I would read in the newspaper

"cop shot down in the street,"

killed, dead, a human being,
a fellow human being!

I say, you know,
you know, you know, "so what?!

"So what?" You know.

"He's probably one of those."

You know?

But hey, I'm not a racist,
I'm not a racist.

I have white friends, though.

But you know,
I don't see them as white.

I don't see them
as white, those...

I had a lot of anxiety
about my boys.

I told them, you know, I...
Just, you know, I...

I said, you know,
"a cop stops you," you know

"throw your hands up,"
you know, "let them...

Let them tell you
what they want," you know?

"Be... be sure and find out
who they are," you know?

"Be sure and tell me
their names."

But they never told me,
they never told me.

Aw...

Stephen was in Stanford.

Oh, came home one weekend
to sing with the band.

Cop pulled him over,
pulled a gun at his head!

How do you think a father feels?

Stuff that happened to me
50 years ago

happening to my boys, man.

You know,
and they just... they...

Aw, they didn't even tell me,
they didn't even tell me

because it would just
make me sick, just make me sick.

And even Rudy, my oldest...

Hey, Margaret! Margaret!

Margaret, tell them, tell them.
Didn't they?

Pull you over that time?

The alhambra cops insulted you
and Rudy that time?

Aw, man.

Crap.

My enemy.

Man: The Rodney king incident
had nothing to do with race.

But because he was black

and he was being beaten
and you saw.

This filmy tape...
Uh, and it brought back...

In the minds
of a lot of people, uh, the...

The, uh, terrible beatings
of the South,

the history of...
Of lynchings in the South

and suddenly it became a major,
major... uh, racial issue.

Gates must go!

Gates must go!

Woman:
We have watched young men

lying on sidewalks...
Handcuffed.

Oftentimes
we've seen the police

put their foot on their necks.

We've watched men humiliated.

We have felt helpless
to do anything about it.

Who would have ever thought
this was going to happen to us?

We wasn't raised like this.

We wasn't raised
with no black-and-white thing.

We had all kinds of friends.

Black, white, Mexican, Chinese.

Most of our friends
were Spanish.

I guess a first time
for everything, though.

You wouldn't have known him
to recognize him.

It was a hell of a look.

That's why he has
a lot to be thankful for.

I told him he had a lot
to be thankful for.

Hell of a lot.

He couldn't even talk,
just, "duh, duh, duh."

I said,.

It took three plastic surgeries

to get Rodney to look
like Rodney again.

But I knew one thing...

My brother's son, sitting up
there in that hospital bed

that I saw looking like hell,
that I saw...

I knew I was going
to do everything

to fight for our justice
and fairness.

Because I didn't care
if it was the president.

Well, you know how, like,

the president of
the United States

he's, like, the top thing.

Anything happened to
the president, everybody'd rave.

Well, that's the way
I felt towards Rodney.

I mean, here's a nobody, right?

But that's the way
I felt towards him.

You understand what I'm saying?

You do?

All right.

Is this America
or South Africa?

Man: I am announcing today that
we have obtained indictments

against four Los Angeles
police officers

for their role in the beating
of Mr. King.

LAPD officer Laurence Powell...

Timothy wind...

Theodore briseno...

And sergeant Stacey koon

have been indicted for assault
with a deadly weapon

and for excessive use of force under color of authority.
And for excessive use of force under color of authority.

Powell holds the Baton
like this.

That is not a good...

The proper way to hold the Baton
is like this.

Now, one of the things
that everybody is talking about

is why did it take
56 Baton blows?

And it all comes down to, Powell
had no strength and no power

in his Baton strikes

because he was
weak and inefficient

with the Baton training.

Oh, yeah, uh, I know
what I was going to do.

Prior to this...
We lost the choke hold...

The upper body control hold...
In 1982.

If we still had the choke hold

this whole videotape
would have never been on;

This whole incident would
have lasted about 15 seconds.

And the reason we lost
the upper body control hold...

Because in a period of about...

We had something
like 17 or 20 deaths

in a period of about
1975, '76, to 1982

and it was associated with...

It was being used on blacks,
and blacks were dying.

And a number of, uh... some...
The so-called community leaders

special-interest-group
community leaders

came forward and complained

and created the hysteria about
the upper body control hold,

that it was an inhumane
use-of-force treatment.

And Gilbert Lindsay,
who was a really neat man

saw a demonstration
on the Baton,

and he said, "you're not going
to beat my people

with that Baton."

He said, "I'd rather
you use a choke hold."

But a couple
of other people said

you could beat them
into submission

you could break their bones

but you're not choking
them anymore.

And so the political framework
was laid

for the elimination
of the upper body control hold.

Reporter: March 16, 1991,

a young black woman
is shot to death

by the Korean owner
of a grocery store

for allegedly stealing
a bottle of orange juice.

Reporter: Harlins' family was asked
if this will lead to violence.

I damn sure hope so

that there will be all the hell
in the black community

and will stand up and see this
insanity for exactly what it is.

Reporter:
Harlins' death occurred

days after
the Rodney king beating

and added to the racial tensions

in the black community.

Woman: I have a favorite saying

that probably is not going
to come off too well, either,

but I'm just going to be honest.

I feel like the Koreans
were like roaches.

They were burnt out
from long beach to Pasadena.

All their businesses
were targeted.

Latasha's name was written
on many of them.

Smith: Barbara, could you come in here.
Smith: Barbara, could you come in here

for a minute, please?

Latasha hits Mrs. Du
in the face

four times, very viciously.

She knocks her down twice.

I mean, this fight
was no contest.

I'll take the girl.

I'll take the girl,
this little girl.

Didn't you think the girl
was much smaller?

Misleading.

Miss five-six, 152 pounds,

and she beats the hell
out of this lady.

Oh, Barbara, let's take
this back from the beginning

because it goes so fast...

52 seconds and a 15-year-old
girl is dead.

And it's tragic,
it is so tragic.

The gun had a hair trigger.

They had been robbed before.

And there was racism involved.

I mean, the Koreans
are like I am.

I'm a racist.

How can I live in America
and not be a racist?

I pull for the black coach;

I pull for the team
with the black quarterback.

We all have those feelings.
Now watch this.

It's a nine-year-old boy...

A nine-year-old little boy
with his 12-year-old sister

had to watch this killing.

Isn't that sad?

9:00 Saturday morning,
there's the young lady coming up

almost like Hollywood
in a black sweater on the left.

Now watch this very carefully.

This is an enhanced tape.

It's been played
over and over again.

It's a surveillance tape,
it's very poor quality

but it would have
cost us $300,000

to get anything better than
this, so watch this, watch this.

Look at there,
watch very carefully.

Watch, look at there,
look at there.

Doesn't she have
a strong right hand?

Whoom, look at there!

Like a billiard ball
in the pocket!

Whoom, look at there
in the face!

Whoom, she knocks her down

and muhammad Ali
couldn't do better.

Whoom! She hits Mrs. Du
in the face.

The lady throws the chair.

Mrs. Du is reaching
under the counter.

She's trying to get the gun,

trying to get
the gun out of the holster,

and latasha comes back to the
counter with the orange juice.

She puts the orange juice back.

And the gun! She sees the gun.

She makes one step!

Boom! Blood, brains, right
under the cash register!

Now, when I first heard
about this case

they had the girl walking
out of the front door

shot in the back,
walking down the street.

But it didn't happen that way.

'Cause if you look at her head;

You look at the girl's head

in relationship to the cash
register right under there

36 feet from the front door.

That's enough, Barbara,
thank you very much.

Isn't that sad?
Isn't human life cheap?

Let's play it again.

We found it very unusual

that Charles Lloyd

the top black attorney in this
city, would take this case...

A millionaire.

But for Charles Lloyd
to defend a Korean woman

in the death of a black child...

Well, I guess he
just sold his card.

He's no longer a card-carrying
member of our community

or our... nation as a people
any longer.

He's a sellout.

I guess that's just
the best way we could put it.

Because we all know as we sit
here today as black people

if either of us had killed
a Korean child...

Shot them in the back
of the head...

And it was recorded
on videotape

and it was recorded
on videotape

we would not be sitting
here talking today.

Soon ja du took the gun

because, uh, so nervous.

Maybe I understand
that situation

because I have a...

A similar
situation in my store.

Five, six youngster come in,
come in at one time

usually a black... black guys,
maybe 15, 17 years old.

One guy's talking with me,
one guy's asking the price

one guy's asking
which one is where.

Then that makes me look
another place.

Then they gonna try
steal something.

They have a big backpack
full of soda, whatever.

After that I...
I really hate this country.

I really hate!

We are not like
customer and owner,

but just like enemy.

Justice denied latasha harlins

is justice denied
every American citizen.

And the sentencing of soon ja du
was a $500 fine...

Restitution
to the funeral expenses.

You can't bury a dog
in Los Angeles for $500.

Latasha's funeral cost $7,000.

So $500 fine...

We think it's more to the tune
of $1 billion

it cost this city
April twenty the ninth,

because no matter
what people say

the injustice done
to Rodney king...

It just coincides,
as there's a parallel

between Rodney and latasha.

Smith:
We lived in apartment a-6,

which is right next door to a-8

which is where
George holliday lived.

And the next thing we knew
there were ten or 12 officers

making a circle
around Rodney king...

And they started to hit him.

And they were kicking him

and they were hitting him
with sticks.

And we were just, like,
"oh, my goodness!"

I thought he was really
in danger out there

it was such
an oppressive atmosphere.

I knew it was wrong.

Whatever he had done,

I just knew in my heart,
this is wrong, you know.

I mean, they can't do that.

And even my husband
was petrified.

He said, "let's go inside."

He was trying to get me
to come away from the scene.

But I said no.

I said, "we have to watch this,
because this is wrong."

And my husband was petrified

because he comes from a country
where this is prevalent;

Police abuse is prevalent
in Mexico.

So we stayed
and we watched the whole thing.

And I was kind of upset
at the outcome

because I had a lot to say.

I was scheduled to testify
and I was just really upset.

I was scheduled to testify
and I was just really upset.

And I said to the prosecutor

I said, "well, when
do you want me to come?"

Because the date said
such-and-such a time

and that was, um...

And he said, "well, I'll
call you and give you a time

so you don't have
to wait around."

Now, the time came
and the time went

and so I started to call him

and I said, "well, are you
going to call me or not?"

And he said, "well, I can't
really talk to you.

I don't think we're
going to be using you

because what you say contradicts
what the highway patrol said."

And I remember I was so upset.

I wrote him a letter
and I faxed it

and I said, "these officers
are going to be acquitted."

I said, "if you do not
put one resident..."

Terry white did not put one
resident, not one resident

except for George holliday.

I said, "if you do not put one
resident to say what they saw,

those officers are going
to be acquitted."

I said, "let the jury
hear the facts.

Let them hear what
other people have to say."

But I think that the prosecution
was just dead set

that the video
was going to tell all.

But that video doesn't show

where those officers
went and assaulted Rodney king

in the beginning...
Do you see that?

And I remember I was so upset,
I said to my co-worker,

I said, "oh, my goodness,
I just had this terrible dream

that the officers
were acquitted."

And she said

"oh, you know, they're
not going to be acquitted.

You shouldn't think like that."

I said, "I wasn't thinking,
it was a dream."

Well, I just saw the men
in the courtroom

and I just felt in my heart
something's happening.

Because dreams are made
of this indelible substance.

And my co-worker said,

"you know, you shouldn't
think like that."

I said, "I wasn't thinking.

It was a dream, and that's all."

Guilty! Guilty!
We saw it, we know it!

Reporter: It took a year,
but the case that caused

a furor over police brutality

has finally come to trial.

Reporter: Because of pretrial
publicity and political fallout

the trial was moved
from Los Angeles

to nearby ventura county.

It took a month to find...

Reporter:
The jury is essentially

white and middle-aged.

There are seven men
and five women.

None of the jurors are black.

Smith:
I knew there would be people

unhappy with the verdict,

but I didn't expect anything
near what happened.

They were taking us
out of the courtroom

and there were a lot
of obnoxious reporters around

and the police were trying to...

Get us into the buses
and hide our faces,

get us into the buses
and hide our faces,

and one of the obnoxious
reporters...

Said, "why are you hiding
your heads in shame?

Do you know that people
are dying...

And buildings are burning
in South Los Angeles

because of you?"

And to see on television
all the political leaders...

Mayor Bradley and president bush
condemning our verdict...

And...

Some of the jurors, we kind of
tossed it around that...

Was this some sort of a setup?

We felt like we were pawns
of the system...

And that we were
being tossed aside.

And even the judge...

When he was
reading the verdict,

some of the jurors said
there was a look of disdain

on his face.

And...

He had the power and the right
to withhold our names

for a period of time,
but he didn't do that.

He just released them
right away.

And our names and our addresses
were published in newspapers...

All across the country.

The New York times published
the value of our homes.

We received
threatening letters and...

Phone calls.

But worse than the letters...

Worse than the threats...

All of the jurors
got letters from the kkk

saying, "we support you.

If you need our help...

If you would like to join
our organization,

we would be happy
to welcome you into...

Into the fold."

Into the fold."

Reporter: It was a clean sweep
for the defendants...

Not guilty of assault.

Reporter:
The videotape wasn't enough

to convince a mostly white jury
the officers were guilty.

Within hours there was madness
in the streets.

Man: I took a route home that...
That kept me off the freeways

I went the back roads
through the orange orchards.

Um, about halfway through that
trip I turned on the radio

and listened to the...
I was listening, you know...

The live coverage from
the helicopter reporter

at Florence and normandie

and I was, you know...
I'm just a Kansas boy.

I, you know, it's just like,
"oh, my God, what is going on?"

And then I went home

and I didn't sleep for probably

three, three and a half days.
I ruptured my bowels.

I had diarrhea so bad

I had to have emergency surgery
at 8:30 one night.

Watching this,
it was just the work

of sinister,
diabolical predators.

No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

No justice, no peace!

Man: Tip it over!

Smith: What took place here...

Southern California was rocked.

The whole infrastructure,

the foundation, was cracked.

The seams of that fine fabric

that Los Angeles image
that we have

that California, that sunshine,
we showed the insides

you know, the core,
that which is normally bypassed

or overlooked, was shown;
It came forward,

it let it be known.

Smith: I went downstairs

with a couple of, uh,
copy messengers, uh...

I grabbed a pair of scissors,
uh, uh...

A guy looked, uh,
like he was coming in.

Uh, I shouted at him
with the scissors

and a couple of, uh, copy, uh,
copy messengers with me.

Uh, my wife is
an emergency room doctor

and she said, because she feels

that she's considerably more
in tune with the kinds of guys

who go around with scissors,
uh, and other weapons

"why don't you just go back
upstairs and work with the copy

because, uh, you might not do very well with the crowd.
Because, uh, you might not do very well with the crowd

you seem to want
to be running with."

But I wasn't about to be stopped

because, uh...
There was a clear sense

that clearly, big and dreadful
things, uh, were happening.

Smith: I think this thing about

the Koreans and the blacks,
you know,

that wasn't altogether true,
you know?

And the thing
that happened in, to...

To the... to the Korean stores,
in the black neighborhood

that was just due to lack of,
uh, lack of, uh

lack of, uh, lack of, uh...

Smith:
My husband came to United States

28 years ago

and he was very high educated
and very nice to all the people.

And he started business,
seven, ten, 20 years ago

and he work so hard,
he work very hard.

And he also donate a lot
of money to the Compton area.

And the city council,
they knows him,

and the police, they knows him.

Then why he has to get shot,
you know?

I don't know why.

So really angry... you know?

And this thing, they talk about
the blacks and the Koreans.

Well, we wasn't lootin'
over there in Korea town...

Those wasn't blacks...

Those wasn't blacks lootin'
over there, lootin' over there.

Those was Mexicans lootin'
over there, those wasn't blacks.

Smith: Uh, as soon as I heard

about the, uh... the verdict,

uh, which wasn't
until about 5:30...

Uh, I immediately headed
downtown to Parker center.

Uh, I drove into the garage.

There's Daryl gates,

getting into his car.

I said, "where you Goin'?"

"I got something I gotta do."

That's the only answer I got.

Now, as you may have heard,

he was on his way
to a fundraiser

right up there in brentwood.

First of all,

I don't think it was
a fundraiser, uh...

I don't think it was
a fundraiser at all.

I think it was
a group of people,

real strong supporters of mine,

real strong supporters of mine,

uh, and they begged me
to be there.

And I didn't want to go.

I don't like those things.

I don't like them at all, but...

Why? Why he has to be shot?

He was very high educated!

Gates: And, uh,
so I made a commitment

and I'm the kind of person who
likes to keep a commitment.

Uh, and when I thought that
I had some, uh, serious problems

uh, my driver said, you know,

"we're almost there, chief,
we're almost there."

Uh, and my intent
was to drop in

say, "hey, I think we got a, uh,
riot blossoming, I can't stay."

Park: He also donate a lot of
money to the Compton area,

and the Compton police,
they knows him,

and the city council,
they knows him.

Gates: To drop in, say,

"hey, I think we got
a riot blossoming.

I can't stay."

And that's basically
what I did.

But it's awful hard
to get away.

I kept walking towards the door,
walking towards the door.

Uh, people want to, uh,
take your picture,

uh, shake your hand,

and, uh...

It took longer than I thought.

Sheinbaum: So, after I got done
with that...

Trying to figure out what in
the hell

was going on with him...
I mean, he's the chief!

And this whole thing
very well may be falling apart!

Man: You got these
young brothers out there

thinking that
they're getting something

that they're going
to make a living with

and getting something
they can buy a car.

Like the white people have cars,
why can't I have a car?

They're getting something so
they can... get a piece of gold.

White people have gold,
why can't I have gold?

They're getting something
to get a house.

The white people have a house,
why can't I have a house?

And they actually think

that is something that's
giving resources to them

but they're killing themselves

just like the wolf
who's licking the blade

and they're slowing dying
without knowing it.

That's what's happening to
the community, you with me?

Smith:
Many people were just there

because other people were there.

A lot of people
didn't really know why.

I'm pretty sure most
of the hispanic people

didn't even know why

because, basically,
the Rodney king

basically came out

on channel two, four, five,
seven, nine, 11 and 13.

Basically
no hispanic news people

really even came out with it,
not until after the incidents

not until
after the riots started.

So... basically most
of the hispanic people

didn't even know why.

That's.

You know, people were
just as pissed off

people were just as on-edge
in the Latino community

as they were in South central.

And of course South central
is half Latino...

But nobody talks
about that, right?

I mean, you know, there's
just as much police abuse

in the Latino community.

I mean, you see, Anna...

You see police stopping people

for jaywalking all the time,
I mean, all the time.

This does not happen
in Beverly hills.

This does not happen
in the valley.

Even though you are doing all the right things...
Even though you are doing all the right things...

I mean, it's... you're...

You're, you're... there's still
something wrong with you.

You know, maybe it's because
you speak Spanish,

maybe it's because
you have brown skin,

maybe it's because
you come from Mexico,

but, you know what?

You're just not walking right,
you're just not walking right.

Smith: We had an
insurrection in this city before

and if I remember correctly, it
was sparked by police brutality.

We had
the kerner commission report

and as I stand here today,
in 1992

I see that what that report
cited still exists today.

Mr. President,

we want our black men back on
America's agenda.

They've been dropped off of
everybody's statistics and data.

They're not in school,
they're not employed,

they don't live anywhere...

They go from grandmama
to mamma to girlfriend.

And, Mr. President,
not everybody in the street

is a thug or a hood!

Not everybody is a criminal.

And if they are, Mr. President,

then what about your
violations?

Oh, yes, I'm angry...
We are angry.

The fact of the matter is,
whether we like it or not,

riot was the voice
of the unheard.

Smith: My reaction?

Surely they're not
coming up here.

This Ridge is armed, secure.

I was raised
in a hunting culture.

So was my neighbor,
so was my son.

I got calls
from my liberal friends...

"Chuck, could you lend me a, uh,
a shotgun?"

And I said, "oh, yeah, you have
to wait two weeks to buy one."

But I did lend them
some protection.

But my friend John milius,
the screenwriter,

said, "nope,
they're all being used."

Smith: I just thinking about,

everybody pumped up,
talking about

the Koreans and the blacks,
the blacks and the Koreans

the blacks... the blacks
and the Koreans

the blacks and the Koreans...

I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

Now, pep boys,
now see, that right there

see, I didn't like the idea
of them hittin' pep boys...

No, I didn't, I didn't,
I didn't like that.

Not because I think...

Well, the only reason I can
think they hit pep boys

is just that pep boys
was just too damn hot.

You know, people say, "well,
you know, let me get in there

get me some of that... whatever the hell they got in there."
Get me some of that... whatever the hell they got in there."

But, uh, now I didn't
loot this time, no, no I didn't.

Now, girl, get it out.
Get it out!

No, I'm not ki... get that out!

I didn't loot,
no, I didn't! I didn't!

I did in 1965, but this time

it was just much more
than that for me.

But I was praising the ones
that did it, though.

I was, like, "yeah," you know

"you need to go ahead
and burn that sucker down."

Crowd: Guilty! Guilty!

We saw it, we know it.

Guilty! Guilty!

Smith: And he worked so hard...

He work very hard...

Then why he has to be shot?
You know?

I don't know why.

So, really angry, you know?

I cried...

Most of my life...

This is the time, I cried...

A lot.

We got a call
from our stringer in beirut

wondering if we were all right.

You know you've got
some trouble in your city

if your stringer from beirut
calls to say,

"are you all right?"

Smith: Well, there was the fuse

that was still burning

and the uneasiness
that was growing

but it was basically
business as usual...

You know,
"such-and-so on line one,"

"such-and-so on line two";

"Traffic: Wilshire,
Santa Monica," like that.

Bunch of us had to go to lunch
at the grill in Beverly hills.

You know, again, you know,
major showbusiness, you know,

kind of sort of dead-center
business restaurant...

Kind of loud but genteel.

And there was
an incipient panic.

The tension in the restaurant
was palpable, it was tangible.

You could cut it with a knife.

All everybody was talking of:
"Did you hear, did you hear?"

You know, little bits
of conversation

little bits of information.

And we were basically working
ourselves up into a frenzy,

which had to do with guilt,
you know, just generic guilt.

And...

Uh, we're driving back
from the restaurant to here.

You know, it's about
a ten-minute drive.

People talking about the need to
buy guns to protect themselves.

So I mean, you know,
we've gone from there to there.

And I don't mean to tell you

that anything happened
in the restaurant

you know, like somebody screamed
at somebody or something.

No, nothing, just,
you know, Caesar salad...

You know, the whole bit
went like that.

And, uh, so, uh,

we're coming from
the underground garage into here

and we see people
running around.

I mean, people walk fast
in this business

but now they're, like, running.

And so we looked at each other
and we said,

"we got to close the office!"

Shut down.

I mean, so we've gone from,
"I'm a little nervous"

to, "we got to close the office."
To, "we got to close the office."

This is a business.
We don't shut down.

Memo goes out,
"office closed for the day."

Oh, then I remember...

Somebody said,

"did you hear they're burning
down the Beverly center?"

Yeah, by the way, "they."

You know, I mean, you know,
there's no who.

No, no, no...

It's just, you know, uh, the,
uh, they, uh, you know...

"Did you hear?

They're burning down
the Beverly center."

What do you mean who?
There is no who.

It's irrelevant.
Just, you know... just "they."

You know, somebody,
it's not us.

So, uh, you know, when I really
started to worry about,

you know, the... the...
You know,

safety of my, you know,
my family,

I mean, you know, because
the panic was so high...

You know, "where is the nanny?
Where is the kids?"

I actually started
to think, you know,

"do I, uh, you know,
do I deserve this?"

And, I mean, you know,
not me personally, no...

Me generically.

Maybe so, even though,

I mean what's provoked it
was the spark, you know,

which was the verdict,
which was absurd.

But... but... but that was
just the spark.

I mean, this was something
that was set, uh, years before

and, uh, you know,
I mean maybe...

Not maybe, you know,
the system plays unequally

and the people
who were the "they"

who were burning
down the Beverly center

had been victims of the set...
Uh, victims of the system,

whether well-intentioned or not.

And so I basically began
to absorb a little guilt,

and say, uh, you know,
"I deserve it, I deserve it."

And, yeah, I don't mean to say

I deserve to have
my house burned down.

But the "us" did, you know,
not in, you know, I...

I mean, I like to think
not intentionally

but, uh, you know, maybe so.

It's just, uh...

It was just so awful out there

to see all of the...
The... the destruction;

So heartbreaking to see
all of those, you know...

The devastation

and the, uh, people burning
down their own neighborhoods.

I mean, you know, burning down
our neighborhoods I could see

but... but they burnt
down their own.

That... that was
more dramatic to me.

So the second day, I had a date

and my date lived in the valley

which is about 20 minutes away.

And they said,
"don't drive freeways."

And I was just
three weeks separated

and I didn't want to be alone.

So I called him up and I said,

"well, are you going
to see me tonight

because I don't
want to be alone?"

He says, "yeah."

So he came to pick me up

and I said, "oh, my God,
where are we going to go?

"We can't eat anywhere.

Everything is closed."

And then I said, "wait a minute.

And then I said, "wait a minute.

A hotel wouldn't be closed.

They're going
to be serving food."

I said, "let's go see if we can
go to the Beverly hills hotel."

And so we did.

Much to my shock,

the whole town,
picture-business people

everybody was there.

And so for the two or three days
of heavy rioting

we just all went
to the Beverly hills hotel.

So when they called me
to interview me

when the hotel closed,

I said, "I went there
36 years for lunch."

I said,
"I wrote my book there."

When my book starts out

I was driving into
the Beverly hills hotel.

And I talked

about how we were all at
the polo lounge at the hotel

when... during the riots...

Because it was foremost
on my mind.

Some man wrote me a letter.

"To Mrs. Young:

I saw your interview
on television.

As far as I'm concerned,

you are an.

You are a dumb bimbo.

How stupid can you be?

You are talking about having
fun at the Beverly hills hotel

during the riot...
You are an embarrassment."

And I'm sitting here
reading this letter

and I'm thinking, "oh, my God,
if only he'd left his number

so I could call him up
and explain to him

no way in the world

did I mean to be flippant on
television about the riots."

It's just that, there we were
at the Beverly hills hotel.

I mean, it was like,
how far down can you go?

At a certain point
you just have to say

"let me put this
out of my mind and go on."

That was the mood
at the Beverly hills hotel:

Safety in numbers.

Nobody can hurt us
at the Beverly hills hotel.

It's like a fortress.

And we were just like

"here we are,
and we're still alive,

and we hope that people will
be alive when we come out."

Smith: It was rage, black rage.

The blacks were upset,
they were extremely upset.

And since I've been back home

I see all the vacant lots.

No wonder they
were so upset, right?!

You've got to realize
that the verdicts...

The not-guilty verdicts...

Was heavy on everybody's mind.

And I was following the trial

because I wanted to see
if justice worked.

And on that particular day,
justice did not work.

Yes, I was upset,
I was highly upset.

That could have been me out
there getting my ass whooped.

And those four officers could have walked away.
And those four officers could have walked away

after whoopin' my ass like that?

I'm afraid not!

I'm afraid not!

Ha!

I'm afraid not!

Whoo!

Whoo!

Whoa! Whoo!

I'm afraid not!

George h.W. Bush: We must
respect the process of law

whether or not we agree
with the outcome.

Smith: Well, it was like

a carnival out there.

And I said to my cousin frances

I said, "frances, you see this?"

She say,
"girl, it's getting worse."

And so I said, "well, let...

You know, let me
get my butt upstairs

before something happen."

And it seemed like
as soon as I said that,

I heard, like,
a bottle being thrown.

And I felt, like,
a tingling sensation

and it was itching
and it was moist.

And I did it like this

and I looked down
and I saw blood.

And I said,
"frances, I'm bleeding!"

And so we went up to her house.

She say, "lift up your gown
and let me see."

She say,
"elvira, it's a bullet!"

I say, "what?"

I say,
"I didn't heard nothing."

She say, "well, yeah,
but it's a bullet."

And she say,
"you go lay down there.

Let me call
St. Francis hospital,

tell them send an ambulance,
you been shot."

And the neighbor
came over and said,

"you know, why... you know,
why they have to shot you?

You don't mess
with none of them people.

Why they have to shot you?"

You know, matter of fact,
after some people say to me

"elvira, what you doing in it?"

I said, "I wasn't in it."

I said, "I was coming
to my house...

Coming... to... my... house.

It happened right here.

It was kind of like a drive-by."

So, you know, frances say,
"well, the, uh...

The ambulance... they gon'
to take 15, 20 minutes."

I say, you know, I say,
"frances, I cannot wait that.

I'm going."

So I went upstairs
and I said to my oldest son

I say, "amant,
take care your brothers."

And he was standing
up there crying.

By then they was all
standing up there crying.

And what I did for them
not to see the blood

I covered it up with my gown

and then I didn't cry
so I wouldn't be nervous.

And so I went downstairs
and I was getting in the car.

And frances say,
"what you doing?"

I said, "I'm driving."

She say, "no, you not!"

And she got in and she took
all the back streets

because the... you know,
the streets was blocked.

And she was so supportive.

She say, "elvira,
you feel dizzy?"

She say, "you feel...?"

You know, she say...
She say, "you all right?

You feel cold?"

She say... she say,
"the baby move?"

She say, "you nervous?"

I said, "no, I'm not nervous

but I'm worried
about this baby."

I say, "I don't want
to lose this baby."

She say, "elvira, everything's going to be all right.
She say, "elvira, everything's going to be all right.

Just pray."

And we had to be
blowing the horn.

And we got to
St. Francis hospital.

And, uh, we went to the front
desk and... and she say

"she been shot!"

Everybody stopped
what they was doing.

And they say,
"well, what she doing walking?"

I said, "I'm all right."

And we went upstairs to the...

They put the monitor on
to see if the baby was all right

and they found
the baby heartbeat.

Soon as they found
the baby heartbeat...

Long as I knew, whatever
it was... boy or a girl...

It was all right,
then I calmed down.

And, uh, uh, matter of fact,
you know,

my doctor, Dr. Thomas,
he was there in emergency room.

What a coincidence, right?

Because everybody saying, "oh,
you the best patient, you know.

All day long everybody else
been screaming and yelling."

I said, "well, you know,
I was too nervous.

I couldn't do nothing."

And, uh, long as I saw
Dr. Thomas,

to see a familiar face,
I knew...

I was looking
for a familiar face.

As long as I saw him

I knew I would be... I thought,
you know, I'd be all right now.

So Dr. Thomas came over with
another doctor, and he say,

"elvira, you know, we don't
know how deep is the bullet

but we going to operate on you.

And when we operate on you

we going to take the baby out

so you don't have
to go through all that."

And they say, um, "do you
understand what we saying?"

I say, "yeah!"

And they say, "okay, sign here."

And that's the end
of what I remember.

I remember them preparing me

and taking me up
to the operating room, but...

Nella! Nella! No!

She like company.

No!

And then I remember I heard
Dr. Thomas in the background,

and I think I remember him
scrubbing his hands

but I was too drugged up.

And he say,

"elvira, you've got a six-pound,
12-ounces little girl."

And he told me
her weight and, uh, her length.

And then he say,
"when we... when she born..."

Yeah, "when she born,
she had a bullet in her elbow."

And he say,
"well, when we clean her up

"the bullet was
between two joints.

"But we operate on her
and we took the bullet out.

But now your daughter is fine
and you are fine."

[ Laughs

yeah, yeah, yeah...

Yeah.

Oh, and the doctor say,

"when the bullet went in,
it destroyed the plas...

"It went...
Destroyed the placenta

and it went through me.

She caught it in her arm.

If she didn't caught it
in her arm

her and me would be dead."

So, um...

It's, like, open your eyes.

Watch what's going on.

Smith: Well, it's all confusion,
Smith: Well, it's all confusion,

and the more we talk about this

the more facets
of this confusion

I can understand and see.

I was coming back after having
given a performance in Seattle.

So I was in Los Angeles
on the day of the riots.

And some friends of mine
who are very involved

in things having
to do with civil rights

said, "you know,
you really ought to stay."

And I said, "I can't."

I said, "I have to, you know...

"I'm in the middle
of a tour... I can't.

And who knows

whether or not the verdict's
going to come down today anyway.

I'm going to go, you know,
to... to New York."

And so, I was
on the plane thinking,

"well, gosh, I didn't have time
to stay in Los Angeles,

but what could
I have done anyway

besides go to somebody's church
and sing a few songs?

What... what could I have done
besides to talk or to sing

to somebody who would
listen to me?"

I don't think people
were in the mood

to... to... to... listen...
To sing at that time somehow.

But of... of course, of course,
of course, of course, exactly.

In the civil rights movement,
you'd sing first

and then you would organize
whatever protest was happening

that day or that week
or whatever.

And then we'd sing
at the end of it as well.

I mean, you'd sing
all through it.

We as African Americans have

a great tradition of singing
ourselves through troubles.

This is how the spiritual
came into being...

That in order to...
To... to... deal

with this unbelievable situation

of having been transported
from one's homeland

and been brought to some
strange place and made a slave,

we had to sing ourselves
through that.

We didn't sing ourselves
out of it.

We sang ourselves through it.

And I think that
if I were a person...

You know, sort of a...
A... a... a...

You know, a teenager or
a youngster...

20 or something...

And I felt that I were being
heard for the first time

it would not be singing
as we know it.

Oh, I think it would be a roar.

It would come
from the bottom of my feet.

I think it would be...
It would just be like a lion

just roaring.

It wouldn't be singing,
it wouldn't be words,

it would be...
Oh, I think it would be...

It would just be like
the earth's first utterance.

I really do feel so.

Reporter: Denny was pulled out of the truck, kicked and beaten,
Reporter: Denny was pulled out of the truck, kicked and beaten,

all of it on live television
eventually seen coast to coast.

Reporter: Police say the man
putting his foot on Denny's neck

and holding him down as others
continued to attack him

is 27-year-old Henry Watson.

Well, I mean, you know, huh,
that's mind blowing.

I mean, you know,
you're talking about history.

I mean, you know, that...

That's, you know,
that's a lot of pressure.

You know what I'm saying?
You understand what I'm saying?

I mean, you know, I mean,
you go through life, you know,

you want to make your mark,
you know,

you want to leave your mark,

and say, you know, hey,
you know, I was here,

you know, I did it, you know?

I passed through this, you know,
uh, through life, you know,

uh, but never
in my wildest dreams...

Did I think that something
like this would have happened

in order for me to make my mark,
you know, to leave my mark.

I mean, you know, I mean,
to have my name uttered

in the same breath
as these two gentlemen

or the same sentence
as these two gentlemen,

I mean
you understand what I'm saying?

I've been placed
next to Martin...

I'm talking about Martin Luther
king... and Malcolm X.

I mean, that's, you know,
that's... that's...

That's a lot of pressure,
you know what I'm saying?

That's... that's heavy,
you know?

You know what I mean?
You understand?

Reporter: Here's the situation
from South central.

The LAPD is nowhere to be found.

Smith:
And I guess when I realized

something was wrong

was when they bashed in
the right window of my truck.

And that's the end
of what I remember

till about five
or six days later

when I woke up
in Daniel Freeman hospital.

And they say
that I was in a coma.

And it was... they were
giving me morphine for pain

so it was a really
interesting time.

And I think when it dawned on me

that something big
might have happened was

when important people
wanted to come by and see me.

And one of the first people
I remember coming to see me,

the first person
I was really aware of

who was waiting to see me,
was reverend Jesse Jackson.

And I heard the name
and I'm going, "not that guy.

I mean, that's the dude I seen
on TV all the time."

And then arsenio hall
came by to see me,

and then, about then,
that's when I started to get it.

Reporter: Uh, someone's standing
there, taking a picture.

He's taking a videotape
of the man laying on the street

but nobody's helping him.

But nobody's helping him.

Unbelievable.

Here's a man with a shotgun.

Smith: They accused my brother
Lance of attempted murder

of shooting at Reginald Denny.

They said he attempted to go
and blow up some gas pumps

things of this nature.

Now, my dad got shot
in the streets 11 years ago

over a petty robbery, and
their attitude was, you know,

"we don't want
to bring your family

through the drama
and the trauma."

So, basically, if it's
a black-on-black crime,

you know, if it's a nigger
killing a nigger,

they don't have no problem
with that.

But, oh, you know,
let it be a white victim,

oh, they going to go...

You know, they going to go
to any extremes necessary

to basically convict
some black people.

Reporter: Reginald Denny did not
know who saved his life

until well after
he came out of his coma.

Bobby green is a truck driver.

He drove Denny's big rig
to the hospital.

Lei yuille is a dietitian

who got in the truck
to comfort Denny.

Titus Murphy was on the running
board, waving traffic away.

And Terry barnett
drove her own car

to block intersections
to the hospital.

All four testified

they saw the beating of Denny
on television

and said that they felt
they must go to the scene

to try to help the trucker.

Since my brother was in
the room, he looked over at me,

and he said to me,
"we are christians.

We need to go help him,"
and I said, "you're right."

Smith: And lei,
lei yuille, she's a woman,

and she said that she just
kind of cradled me

because there's no
passenger seat in the truck,

and so I was down on my knees,

and lei was just, like,
covered in blood.

And Titus was on the side,

because they bashed in
the windshield so bad

that Bobby couldn't see
to drive.

So Titus was
on the running board

telling Bobby where to drive.

And Terri...
That's Titus's girlfriend...

She was out in front

driving through traffic,
dodging towards cars,

trying to tell them
to get out of the way.

And the next stop...
Daniel Freeman hospital.

You know, one day
I'm going to have a house,

and it's going to have
one of those rooms,

and it's going to be
of all the riot stuff.

And it's not going to be
a blood-and-guts memorial.

It's not going to be a sad room;
It's going to be a happy room,

where you can just go in there

and have a good ole time
in there.

And it's going to be
of all the funny notes I got

and all the letters
from faraway places,

all the love and compassion.

You know, just framed,
placed, framed things.

And it's just going
to be people in that room

and it's going to be
a wild place.

It's going to be a blast.

One day it'll happen.

Lord willing, it'll happen.
Lord willing, it'll happen.

They caught it on video.

Some brothers beating
the out of a white man.

And then they going to do
everything in their power

to try to convict
those brothers.

No justice, no peace.

That's basically
what my motto is...

You know, you know,
and it's very simple.

If we don't have
no justice here,

they not going to have
no peace.

Peace of mind, peace of body,
peace of mind.

You may wake up with a dent,
a dent in your head.

From now on in life...
It may not be you;

It may be your daughter,
someone in your family...

There's just not going
to be no peace.

Huh.

Yeah.

One day I'm going
to have a house.

And when I finally have my house

I'm going to have
one of those rooms set aside

and it's going to be
my "no justice, no peace" room.

I'm going to have "no justice"
over here on the wall,

and over here, "no peace,"

and it's going to be
all my articles and clippings

so that my son, you know,
my children, you know,

could basically see, you know,

if I do happen to be alive,
God willing,

could basically see
what daddy did...

You know, what it takes to be
a strong black man, right?

If God calls you,

what you got to do,
you know, for your people.

Either you stand or you fall.

Either be black or you die.

Huh.

We didn't get to Beverly hills.

That don't mean we not going
to get there, keep it up.

And they say we burned down
our own neighborhoods.

We burned down these Koreans
in this neighborhood.

The Koreans was like the Jews
back in the day,

and we put them in check.

Man: That's not right!

It's not right
what you all doing!

Why'd ya destroy my business?!

I'm trying to make it!

Couldn't you understand that?

Can't you all see it?

I'm trying to make it!

Smith:
To use the language of decline,

decay and despair,

rather than doom, gloom,
and no possibility,

because I think any talk about
despair is not where you end,

but where you start,

and then the courage
and the sacrifice come in...

But at the level of hope,
not optimism.

Optimism and hope
are different.

Optimism tends to be based
on the notion

that there's enough evidence out there.
That there's enough evidence out there

that allows us to think that
things are going to be better.

Much more rational,
deeply secular.

Whereas hope looks
at the evidence and says,

it doesn't look good at all.

It doesn't look good at all.

We going to go
beyond the evidence

to attempt to create
new possibilities

based on visions
that become contagious,

to allow us to engage in heroic
actions always against the odds

no guarantee whatsoever...
That's hope.

I'm a prisoner of hope, though.

I'm going to die
a prisoner of hope.

Never believed that misery
and despair have the last word.

But I think...

I think...

If white folks were
to experience black sadness,

it would be too overwhelming
for them.

Very few whites could take
seriously black sadness

and still live the lives
that they living,

living in denial.

"Oh, it couldn't be that bad."

And they got their own form
of sadness.

It tends to be linked
to the American dream.

But it's a very, very different
kind of sadness.

Smith:
Do you remember where you were

when you learned that there was
going to be a second trial?

Well, I knew as
I left that courthouse

that there was
going to be more.

Hmm.

My experience from
back home told me

that the U.S. government
was going to take its turn now.

Reporter:
Given the level of violence

following the first trial,

defense attorneys say

their questioning
of prospective jurors

will be extremely focused.

Are you afraid?

That's the number-one question.

Are you afraid
to sit on this jury?

Smith: The thing
is, we lost our humane in there.

'Cause we saw that tape
over and over again.

Rodney king became like a doll,
like a little doll.

You know, even me,
I lost my humane in there.

You know, at first...

I told you the first time
I saw the tape how I was.

I was crying and everything.

By the end, I could just,
you know, watch it

with a... pfft! With a soda.

So, um, anyway I'm going to tell
you how we got to this verdict.

Okay.

So, uh, we get in here,
right, and...

All right.

So, at first, everything
was going pretty good

and it looked like
it was going to be a "guilty"

on officer Powell.

Then we come back in here
the next day

and things is going pretty good,
And things is going pretty good,

and this one woman
raises her hand

and she says uh, "oh," you know.

"I think I'm... I think
I'm getting a headache.

I think... I think...
I think I'm going brain dead.

Let's just quit."

I told them, I said,

"I don't believe you
when you say you tired."

I said, "I work
at the post office."

I said, "I work
a eight-hour day.

They come in and they tell me
I got two hours' overtime.

I work two hours overtime,

and I do a job good of it.

And I don't say I'm tired

because that is my job,
and I'm not tired,

and this is our job,
and we are not tired!"

I agree with Maria.

Don't be around here.

If you so tired,

get your out of here.

We got three alternates who
would love to take your places,

so get your out of here
if you so tired.

Here come the black guy.

"I have not slept in two weeks.

"In two weeks, I have not had
one bit of sleep.

And I have broken out in hives."

And he takes off his shirt,

and the man is red
all over his body.

He's got hives
all over his body.

He's crying
and crying and crying,

he goes running
out of the room...

I thought the man was going
to have a heart attack.

Now, we got
this high-class lady, right?

Real good job.

Excuse me.

She's over in the corner
going like this.

"I hate arguing.
I hate, I hate arguing.

I hate arguing,
I hate arguing, I..."

Now she busts out crying...

"Oh, please, if anybody
writes a movie,

if anybody writes a book,

oh, please, don't say nothing
about my family."

And she starts telling us
all this stuff about her family!

Which we didn't know,
so why is she telling us now?

After that day, right,
I broke, right?

Everybody broke, right?

All this stuff that...
That did not have nothing

to do with the case, right?

You know,
once everybody's personal guilt

came out onto the table
and was pushed aside,

then we could look at
the evidence, the testimony,

and, uh, you know, we came to
a verdict on Powell like that.

Guilty... nobody cried.

Nobody argued.

You know, nobody,
you know, brought up

what happened to their sister
six years ago.

We just went
through the evidence.

Such and such said this.

Such and such said that.

Just like in school:
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

It was simple.

It took us five days,
four and a half days

to get to that a.A. Meeting.

After that a.A. Meeting,
it took us two days

to come up with a verdict on all four of them.
To come up with a verdict on all four of them.

Reporter:
Outside the courthouse,

a crowd erupted in cheers

at the announcement
of the two guilty verdicts.

Reporter: The jury found
officer Laurence Powell,

who delivered most of the blows
in the king beating,

and sergeant Stacey koon,
who supervised, guilty.

Timothy wind
and Theodore briseno

were found not guilty.

Man: Did it help?

Oh, yes. Most definitely.

It all depends on what side
of the track you are looking at

as far as whether it helped.

From a black perspective,
looking at it

from a black neighborhood,
it did help.

First of all,
let me make something

perfectly clear...
It's not a riot, all right?

It's more...
It's a civil unrest...

Or, as a lot of us call it,
a revolution.

A riot is a situation

where you don't have
no political overtones.

Did you go out and riot?

Well, you know,
first of all, let me say,

I don't consider it
to be a riot.

Did you go out and engage in
a civil unrest?

You know what, I did not...

I... I... I in...

I was involved in a lot
of things that went down.

And right...
Now you're sounding like...

Now you're sounding
like the average, uh, European

that... that... that kidnapped
the black folks over there.

Do you steal when you're
in a revolution?

Smith: Let me suggest
one possibility here.

As much as we all are going
to talk,

is just to make sure
that we're listening.

Black and brown haven't gotten
together in this town.

They are living side by side,
house to house

throughout South Los Angeles,
you know,

and they're no more
together today...

There's no more
understanding today

than there was in 1992.

Woman: You know,
it's very interesting

that so many
Korean people's anger

came up against the police

because I think
that many people thought

they were cultivating the mayor

and cultivating the police,

and they have
an idea of America

being this land of everything

is that law and freedom
and fairness.

And then they watch
the police standing by

while their businesses
and livelihoods

were being destroyed.

They were shocked.

They thought, "why are they
protecting Beverly hills

and they're not going
to protect us?"

Smith: I used to believe.

America was the best.

I still do.

I don't deny that
because I am a victim.

But...

After the riots,

when we were in such turmoil,

and having
all the financial problems

and all the mental problems,

I began to really realize

that Koreans

are completely left out

are completely left out

of, uh, this society.

And we are nothing.

Nothing.

What is our right?

Why do we have to be left out?

Is it because we are Korean?

Is it because we have
no politicians?

Is it because we don't speak
good English?

Why?
Why do we have to be left out?

We didn't qualify
for medical treatment.

No food stamp.

No g.R.

No welfare.

Anything!

Many African-Americans
who never work

get minimum amount of money
to survive.

We didn't get any...

Because we have a car
and a house.

And, uh, we are high taxpayer.

Where do I find the justice?

Okay?

Many African-Americans probably
think they won by the trial.

I was sitting here watching them

the morning after the verdict,

and all the day,

and they were having a party!

They celebrated.

All of South central,
all the churches.

And they say, "well, finally

justice has been done
in this society."

Well, what
about victims' rights?

They got their rights

by destroying innocent
Korean merchants.

And I wonder if that
is really justice

for them...

To get their rights

in that way.

I was, uh...

Swallowing the bitterness,

swallowing the bitterness,

sitting here alone
and watching them.

Oh, they became all hilarious.

But I was, uh, I was, I was...

I was happy for them, I was...

I was glad for them.

At least that they got
something back.

Okay?

Let's just forget
about Korean victims

and... and... and other victims
who were destroyed by them.

They fought for their rights

for over two centuries.

And maybe because
of their sacrifice,

other minorities...
Hispanic, Asian...

We, we one that suffer more
in the mainstream.

That's why I understand.

I... I have a lot of sympathy
and understanding for them.

That's why I have, uh,
mixed feeling about the verdict.

But I, I...

I wish that I could be part

of their joyment.

I wish that I could live
together with black people.

But after the riots it is...
It's too much difference.

The fire is still there.

How do you say it?

Uh, ig... ig... ig...
Ig... uh...

Igna... ignite?

Igniting.

Igniting, igniting, igniting,

igniting fire, igniting fire.

It's still there.

It can, um,

burst out any time.

Sometimes when I take my ideas
to my homeboys,

they say, "well, twilight,

that's an idea
that's before its time."

Like in 1988,

when I was talking
about the gang truce,

that was an idea they said
was before its time.

But then in 1992

we made it realistic.

And so sometimes I feel
as though I'm stuck in limbo

and so sometimes I feel
as though I'm stuck in limbo

the way the sun is stuck
between night and day

in the twilight hours.

I'm in an area
not many people exist.

And nighttime to me
is like a lack of sun...

Although I don't affiliate
darkness with anything negative.

I affiliate darkness
with what came first

because it was first.

And then relative
to my complexion,

I am a dark individual.

And with me being stuck
in limbo,

I see the darkness as myself.

And I see the light

as the knowledge and the wisdom
of the world

and the understanding of others.

And I know, in order for me
to be a true human being,

I cannot forever dwell
in darkness.

I cannot forever dwell
in the idea

of identifying
with those like me

and understanding
only me and mine.

And so, twilight is that time

between day and night.

Limbo.

I call it limbo.
