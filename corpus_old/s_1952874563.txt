All my people, please select a family to die.

A mass executions bring back much-needed space.

I Apologize for the inconvenience, but it is a necessity.

Each family was murdered.

<i> Except for one family.

Your honor, we are unable to decide.

We loved each other so that we all die together.

No! They can not die! They guard the bakery!

<i> They make the best cinnamon bread in the kingdom!

And if we each own pieces?

With the discount will be combined as one person less to stay here.

Interesting.

<i> But her daughter refused.

Dad, I love my legs.

Do not be selfish! Like one of us dies?

You can save my arm!
After my right ear!

There is no problem about losing one of my fingers.

I walked with my nose!

I guarantee the foot, wrong!

LEG x 2.1 = LOVE Well, I have another.

Okay, I'll do it.

<i> Once in a sense they qualify ...

<i> This is the last birthday party.

<i> There are two things I love in this world more than any ...

<i> that is running and Mathematics.

<i> My father was a mathematician, so math is love love my dad.

What's this? What are you reading?

Pre-calculus?
Yes

We both feel safe in numbers.

In my family, 1 and 1 equal to 3.

I hope when I grow up ...
Life is beautiful.

My father was a track star in college ...

and I dreamed of the day I actually ...

will run faster than him.

But the last good day my dad has ...

no one wins.

What?

That's when I started knocking on wood.

hit each number, each number and give me security.

Without them I would be alone.

They knew the body repair ...

but to fix his head?

My father looked much ...

but I knew he was there, somewhere.

And I'm determined to bring him back ...

then make a deal with the universe.

I'll give it all you like ...

and the universe will come back to me my father.

I gave up dessert ...

I gave up going to the movies ...

I gave up my friends ...

I gave up flipping through the atlas ...

I give up runs.

The more I liked one thing, more is needed to destroy it.

The only thing I did not give figures.

If I can jump rope 43 times without a mistake ...

or if I can catch the ball 27 times in a row ...

The number of fallen leaves that I have to say ...

is equal to the number of letters in the name of my father ...

then maybe I'll be back.

Never stop counting ...

I never stopped hoping.

Rate

insurance ...

Trusted ...

Perfect.

Then, suddenly, my mother decided that three is too many.

Is my drive?

You have no friends, no job.

It's time to go.

But I like it here!

You lie, Mona.

And the worst part is that you do not realize it.

I should care.

You do not.

On the third night, my math book and I agree.

We can help you with the first month's rent.

I save a little, and his father have a disability pension.

He will never find an apartment with a private well as us.

FOR RENT

Suddenly I knew what it was like eternity.

Very long.

Mother!

Mona Gray?

"There we go! I finally got to the point.
Here is Miss. Gelband.

I am the head of his elementary school.

Yes.

I just found her mother in front of the bakery.

Our math teacher, Miss Swordstrum ...

fled to Paraguay to be revolutionary.

Then his mother told me ...

You live in the city ...

who are unemployed but have a college degree ...

Math. It's you! "Me?

Our new math teacher!

I remember playing when you were a child ...

while other children were playing dodgeball ...

You sit in the swing to make the division.

You work for the mayor, Mona Gray!

Why say I have a degree in Mathematics I left college?

Need to turn to pay the rent.

Why? It was you who threw me out.

You may want to teach.
I hate it.

The Committee welcomed to come to accept it!

I like to think of ourselves as being above average.

A teacher for every subject.

I think that makes you our Pass the Math!

We will want to brighten the decor.

Something optimistic and fun.

You make a mistake. I am not a teacher. I do not ...

There is an old saying: "There is no teacher to become a teacher."

I studied mathematics in space with Mr. Jones.

1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

7-8

13 ... 21 ...

Who can tell me what is the next number in this sequence?

Ms. Gray? 34%

Yeah right.

I've never seen him without wax number around his neck.

Number varies according to mood.

High when he was in a good mood ...

lower when he feels depressed.

I wondered whether he had a father figure that I needed.

To the world, only the number ...

but for us ...

signs are visible.

Mr. Jones quit teaching and opened a hardware store.

And I was the only one who understands why.

He tried to increase their numbers.

We did not talk more ...

And then I can count on you?

Hi!

First class?

I Miss Gray.

Really.

Can I call you "mom"?

Series Second, look at the numbers on the board.

Child

Take a look!

Figures are cool.

I liked the second.

I love the ninth.

I like 5.

You are the third series? yes

What's your name?
Elmer Gravlaki.

Okay. Thank you.

Please sit down

Let's go!

make jokes.

How to say ...

Your name and favorite number?

He hit me!

-What is your name?
Danny O'Mazzi.

Danny can not throw things in the minds of others.

Go to the corner and stood facing the wall.

"Cool." It's not fair!

Why he'll stay in the corner facing the wall?

Not a good thing. This is a punishment.

I Williams Rita ...

and I want you to know that Ellen always pee ...

when it becomes nervous.

He has a change of clothes in a room nurse.

So go get changed, Ellen.

Mlle. Gray?

I'm Lisa Venus, and my favorite number is 1 billion.

What?
What to say our name ...

And our favorite numbers.
Yeah, if the league!

And you are ...
Ann DiGanno.

Lisa, why not choose a number between ...

And 9?
Nine ... I mean, 2. No, seven!

Seven?

Seven, of course.

Okay. I have several other volunteers?

Also! Also!

Also! Call me!

My name is Levan Beeze, and my favorite number is 1.

Okay, Levan, Lisa and you come here for the next ...

What is the total Lisa Levan more?

Eight!
-That 's right.

Lice from her hair to give the answer.

I do not have lice in her hair!

Ann is in a bad mood because her parents would divorce.

My mother was a lawyer of his mother.
They will not be divorced!

Very nice. Who wants to be 8?

I?
Okay, Danny.

Who wants to be o. .. plus?

Also! Also!
"Call me.

This is the first equation of human!

What do we do now?

What about us ...

You think?

What if ...

Our numbers ...

with nature?

One of you will bring ...

number ...

every Friday!

As a show of numbers.

And let's call ...

"Figures and Materials."

Can I be first? Is that OK? "

Lisa ... Venus ...

bring very good.

I'm glad you became a new math teacher.

-Dad?

-Dad?

-Dad?

Father, today is my first ...

Mona ... Mona ... read the book ...

a physician and professor at Harvard.

It is called "Shape of Health."

Come here. I'll show you. Come here.

According to the book ...

injured Olympic athletes use them. They have done studies.

The problem is out of the opening round!

Mona is a book that can be relied upon.

Want to join?

Come on. Can you feel, right?

You sit here ... sitting here ...

"Take a deep breath."

and let it all go through the hole.

"Take a deep breath."

And let it all hang out. Leave out, let it out ...

Resume. Inspire ...

and exhale.

"What happened?

It is called "Shape of Health."

I'll call Dr. Wallace.

This solution also does not work.

And you're not helping!

I have a doctor at Harvard Medical School!

This is a funny name, huh? "Sorbet".

If you say several times is ... "Sorbet" ...

Sorbet ...

Sorbet?

Not so funny, but it is a weird name ... "Sorbet."

So is the new math teacher? Mlle. Gray?

I'm Ben.

Ben Smith. I teach science.

This idea is one of the greenhouse?

Greenhouse! Half the room talking softly with their glass houses ...

the other half, no ...

and we will compare ...

their growth rates. Why? What happened?

Rita's mother found him crying in the bathroom ferns ...

saying things like "You're a disgrace to his family" ...

and "What you see, you bastard ... you nuts?"

What is the reaction of plants?

Do not be cute!

Let's discuss this in my office, Mr. Smith?

We have to discuss it in your living room.

Even more, Ms.. Gray.

Mlle. Gray, 7 clouds fall.

Mlle. Gray!

Hey! Be careful, sucker! Sorry.

Does she wear?
Looks like garbage.

Lisa Venus ...
Yes.

No, no.

There are his initials.

Almost was.

You are retarded.
Ann!

I am ready Numbers and Materials.

Me too.

Materials and ...?
Remember!

Every Friday we bring the number of Nature.

Or things that look like numbers.

Mlle. Gray, never remember anything!

How could a teacher?

Danny, now for the angle!

Good for you,,
Lisa ...

Numbers and Materials!

Please.

-Dad?

Happy Birthday, Mona Gray!

Happy birthday.

Just live. "

Let's go for coffee for a change. As a family.

''We are a family.''

Like other families.

Hi Table for three, please. Thank you.

I can not sit here. This is ... air flow.

No, that's gross. Gross.

Come to the fund.

No, no ... not! Whether under the AC.

Here's good?
It's nice!

Thank you. It's great.

It's nice!

Now ...

let's have some fun.

This is Mona's birthday!

Go to the hardware store and buy 2.5 kg of fertilizer.

No, not now. We celebrate.

I have a surprise. Who came on his birthday.

Therapy with a magnet.

Magnet?
Keep your voice down.

I do not want to go back to the FDA.

Why?
Why? Because ...

Since they confiscate! "Thank you.

May reclassify Health Form to get rid of it.

Mona, do not disturb your father.

Mlle. Gray?

Hi.

Are you a parent? Hi I am ...

Ben Smith. His daughter and I worked together.

I am a science teacher. "Hi,

I am the mother of Mona. Very pleased.
Mr. Gray, I imagine.

Sit with us, please.

Agree?

Forgive me now.

The Moby Lane here is fantastic, and toast ...

You ... FDA?

ora.

"Well?"

You are here?
The short version:

I moved here when my fiance ...

got a job as a librarian at the hospital.

Then he ran off with a nurse. That's funny. They stole my car.

Sorry.

This is a tragedy. Sorry.

That's all right. I made a mistake.

All my calculations are wrong.

They must be tired of hearing this, but you ...

very similar.

Really? Everyone says that ...

Mouth ... No doubt.

How you ever been to Science?

I have always had an interest in ...

know why things are like them.

My father also influenced me, but ...

"I want to be a scientist!"

I think I'll buy what you ask.

Mona, do not!

"We do not ..."

Can I help you, Miss Gray. Just wait.

A 2.5 kg bag.
But this ...

Should I go with you?
Mona, please sit down.

It's your birthday! It was his birthday.

Congratulations!

Mr. Jones.

I came to show the new catalog Panida tool.

I have everything I need.

This is my card. Go find me.

I hope your day fun!

He says one thing about that number for the first time ...

when she was 9 years old.

Hi, Mr. Jones! Glad you better. Nine times better than yesterday.

Yesterday you 2.

It is remarkable that a child's record.

You're a great observer.

Notification?

I woke up and thought ...

"If Mr. Jones to use even numbers, my dad would laugh today."

"If he uses an odd number, the new drug will work."

"He must know the number that helps."

But if he knew, he said.

It was just a neighbor who was looking the other way.

So I decided to throw 60 eggs at his car on Halloween.

Hi, Mr. Jones.

Hi, Mona. "Well?"

why do you use this number in the neck?

I think you know.

Know.

Know what?

I also wear an invisible sign.

I say ... "Fuck you, hypocrite!"

I'll take the ax.

Is $ 28.

See what we can achieve when we unite?

See what we can ...

You are the 3? You are the 4?

You are the 5? You're 6?

You are the 7? You're an 8?

Are you a 9?

1, 2, 3 ... 6, 7, 8 ...

Why do it?

At home, the ax. At school he was 7.

A little wrapping paper and some stickers ...

and turned my nightmare into Numbers and Materials.

Levan, what happened?
It's scabies.

Scabies?

Who said that?

Ann? What about you?

My tongue was swollen!

My tongue!

My God! His tongue?

Danny, what's wrong with you?

Malaria!

Emergency calls 911.
I want to report the epidemic.

"Where are you?"
Something like chicken pox.

You know, you can ...
"Miss."

You can make a week of malaria ...

if you make a good tuberculosis today. How do you think?

What are the symptoms?
Tired, coughing. Coughing a little.

"Miss."
With strength.

I'll send an ambulance.

More power! Perfect.

And cramps.
"Miss."

Curve as if gas. Is that OK? "

So: "There we go, I finally got to the point.

Rocks!

Very nice, Elmer. It was as if he has too much gas.

"What happened?

We are representing life.

Lady?
Help children understand ...

symptoms of the disease.

You. .. is ...

fired!

I did not say two words ...

and then reject me?

Wake up, Lisa. You are not sick.

I suffer from cancer.

my mother's wig is made of human hair.

They have some that are not, but you can tell.

Come on.

Wait. Still more must be done a little cancer.

Mlle. Gray?

What is it?

It's a ... 7.

It's not a 7! This ax!
It's a 7.

Love Guru!
Enough, Ann!

Ann was angry because his father had a girlfriend ...

and my mother, a lawyer his mother ...

have pictures to prove it.

It does not exist! Yes!

Levan, just gossip. Do you have to sit in the corner!

Very good

does anyone know what this is?

Bird beak.

It's like the mouth ...
It's ass bird!

Danny!

As for the singing!

Let's pretend it was a mouthful.

And the mouth is always hungry.

And 179 ...

less than 255.

Mouth always wanted to eat the higher number.

Mouth larger because come 5556.

Right.

This is called "greater than" and "less than".

Who wants to come here and make your own?

I'm dying of diphtheria!

Get out of my room now!

Not again, Ellen!

"Faking sick is very difficult."

"The disease is less false than true disease."

Car accident?

Do not know if I can compare ...
Yes, I can.

I had a car accident once. I survived.

War

Old age?

Old age is nothing more than war.

Disease is the biggest of all!

Murder

Mine is the largest.

No,

They say psychopathic serial killer.

Sad, but true.

Cancer?

Fight! Fight!

Stop, you two! Stop!

Or I call your parents!

His mother would not know.

Silent ...
Ann!

Better you should control the classroom, Miss Gray.

Remember to create a "greater than" and "less than"!

Lisa ...

no one is bigger than anyone else!

This is not true.

You're the best teacher in the school.

You know, my father was sick.

Lisa, do not be late to class?

I went, Miss Gelband.

Mlle. Gray ...

Lisa seems happy in his class!

Must create a great atmosphere!

Although I do not understand why, at lunch yesterday ...

he took a cigarette, bologna ...

margarine and a packet of sweetener!

Have you heard that?

Looks like a theme lunch.

A lunch with the theme of "cancer."

Yeah right.

Thank God.

he has someone as well-balanced ...

like you in her life.

Thank God.

Well .. see you tonight!

Tonight?
Open School Night.

Ace 20h sharp!

Why not move?
Why do not you move away?

We're here. We must speak with all teachers in Ann.

We'll leave the math to the end. Ann says that she is a bit strange.

Hi!

You must be a math teacher.

I am the aunt Lisa.

Lisa is one of my students are smart.

I always hated math, but Lisa is a strange child.

Well, should not be easy for him ...

Now?

And for me?

I crossed the state to care for her e. ..

and did not get a "thank you" from anyone.

He had to get my license to work as a broker.

Maybe go back to school. Now I can not do anything about it.

Maybe when her mother is better ...
Increase?

What spacecraft are you falling?

Forgive me now.

I sing seductive lure you here?

No, I ...

If anyone asks, this is a scientific demonstration.

Environment.

I also avoid the elderly ...
Me too.

"Well?"

agree on something?

It is a smile?

No.
Yes

This is very pretty when she smiles.

I must go.

No, do not go.

We are making progress. The last time he saw me, you fired me.

You fired me.

Do not worry. If there are people who would be fired here, is you.

May saw that Ellen made with pork yesterday.

That's ... gave me nightmares!

You put ... Lisa to represent the cancer!

"Yes, I know.

She knew that her mother had cancer?

Sei. That's why she chose.

He will die! Of course.

That's why she chose.

Wait. Want to try?

Try it.

I do not bubble.
Who is not? Bubbles are ...

circle ... This math. 360 St. Think about this.

Everyone loves bubbles.

When I first saw you is ...

teaching, and children in front.

They are ...

representing numbers.

I like that.

That's why I ...

That's when I realized there was something special about you.

You know,

I need ...

must go.

You did it!
Good evening, Mr. Smith.

Good night, Miss Gray.

Once ... a woman from Texas ...

write all the numbers from 1 to 1 billion.

He spent several years ...

and lots of paper.

He uses recycled paper?

I do not know.

If you're using, is a good story. If not used, it is bad history.

Should I ask for your aunt to prepare lunch for you better.

Can not live up to basic chips and chocolate.

Yes, I can. That's what pirates eat.

Why do pirates prefer?

My father took me into a pirate ship when I was little.

Can I stay with you after my mother died?

I have a small apartment.
I'm not too good.

You can not.

because it would be unfair to other students.

I mean, I could help him with math lesson e. ..

would not be fair.

Makes sense.

They are very angry.
You are a brilliant teacher.

'Back Avoiding me, Miss Gray?

ora.

I thought I had dropped something. Window.

Like what? A quadratic equation?

Type a decimal point.

I see a decimal point. He flew in that direction.

Decimal point can not fly.
What are they doing?

They were leaning.

You are a strange woman I have ever encountered.

"So what?"
Then ...

Come on.

I help you find ...

decimal point is tilted.

Going to the movies.

I do not like the movie.

Okay. He did not invite you.

Okay, you can go to the cinema with me if you want.

I do not ... go to the movies.

What folly! It's like saying you do not hear the music.

I hate music.
What is this lie? The third?

I have to go to the hardware store to buy nails.

Lying 4.

I hate thrillers!

This is a 5!

This is 5.
The first is the music.

Is 5. You lie a lot.

Everything about you is funny. Come to the movies with me!

You can pay for popcorn.

Or you hate popcorn, but not really?

I need a nail.

I sat in the middle of the media.

Come on guys!

Hi.

Ms. Gray is not strange.

Yes! And so do you!

Now it's your turn again?
