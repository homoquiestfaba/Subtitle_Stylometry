Buff? Yeah, I'll see you
down there later.

I just gotta finish
some stuff I'm writing.

Okay. 'Bye.

Sooze? Yeah, so did you tell him that
we couldn't afford

twenty bucks a ticket and why didn't he
put us on the comp list?

No, no, there's always a comp list.

Alright. Well, so then,
just get your mother's

car and maybe we'll all
go do something.

Yeah. I gotta get off.
Okay. 'Bye.

Hey, Frankie Hey, what are you doing?

Sleeping? What, at six o'clock?
Sleep when you are dead.

Hey, man, I just got off work.
Why don't you meet me down at the corner.

So? Put on some clothes
and come down, man, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, I wanna
see you, man.

Alright. Yeah.

Hey, why don't you bring that pot
you just bought?

What?

Yeah, fuck you man

Later.

I'm going out later.

No car.

The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.

Fuck.

Don't swear it's impolite.

[SHOPPING CHANNEL HOST]
<i>...suggest that you call immediately.</i>

<i>We are truly thrilled to
bring you this next item</i>

<i>and it's a Host Value Special.</i>

<i>It's the spiral relaxation lamp.</i>

<i>I personally bought one of these for a
very good friend of mine</i>

<i>and ended up falling in love with it.</i>

<i>I found myself mesmerized
by watching the balls.</i>

<i>That's why I suggest that
if you're going to buy one,</i>

<i>that you buy maybe two
or three...</i>

[TV REPORTER]
<i>It started with a traffic argument,</i>

<i>escalated to the firing of a
legally carried handgun,</i>

<i>ending with the death of the man it was
aimed at.</i>

<i>Gordon Riedhale claimed,
he couldn't escape an attacker</i>

<i>who was punching him in the head.</i>

<i>Concealed carry instructors
say, "It's that fear..."</i>

Just depends on the filter capacity.
What size is that pool?

Fifty-five thousand.
Marlboros, chief. Hard pack.

In that case you need a heavy-duty filter.

Two-fifty.
Two-fifty? They go up?

Always two-fifty, my friend.

[TV REPORTER] <i>What that means is
that every armed licensee faced</i>

<i>with danger must make
a split second judgment call.</i>

Timmy-boy!

Peace!

Ah, time's running out, three, two, one!

Score! Yeah!

Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.

What?
Seven-twenty.

I gave it to you.
He paid you man.

You owe me twenty cents.
Come on, seven-twenty.

Seven-twenty.

Yo! You're spitting rice
all over us God.

Here's twenty-five cents.

Guy should cut down on his caffeine
intake.- Needs some pizza in his diet.

I don't think I like
that guy's attitude at all.

Hey, you know what?
Take off the blades. I mean it.

I'm gonna break your
fucking legs. Take 'em off.

You're fascist, man.
Take 'em off.

Neofascist.
Buff, sit.

You know what I mean though?
Somebody ought

to crack that guy
with a baseball bat.

Yeah, well, he's from a Third World
country. He doesn't have it easy.

What? What the fuck do you
know about the third world?

You been
there? No? No, well, I have.

Fuckers live like sardines in a can
over there, you know.

Everything stinks. It's true, there's no,
you know, law, no order. No nothing.

The assholes come over here,
they think it's gonna be the same.

Hey, he's a human being you
can give him that much.

Actually, the only thing
I gotta give that guy is

a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.

Yeah, well, that pizza could
feed a family of four

in Turkey or
India or wherever the fuck he comes from.

Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it
over there, man? Federal Express?

By the time it got there it'd
be way cold and coagulated.

Total waste. Cheese be
stuck to the cardboard.

Buff, that slice is the
difference between life and death

for some half-dead Bangladeshi.

Yo, youâ€™re gettin' me all upset here.

You should get upset.
Everyone should get upset.

When, when
Hitler was greasing the Jews,

people were saying, "Don't get me
upset. Youâ€™re bumming me out."

My duty as a human being is to be
pissed off.

Jesus Christ, not that it makes a
difference on the first fucking place.

Nothing ever changes, man.
Fifty years from
now we're all gonna be dead

and there'll be new people standing
here drinking beer, eating pizza,

bitching and moaning about the
price of Oreos,

and they won't even
know we were ever here.

And then fifty years after that those
suckers will be dust and bones

and there'll be all these generations
of suckers trying to figure out

what they're doing on this fucking
planet and they'll all be full of shit.

It's all so fucking futile.

If it's all so fucking futile,

what the fuck are you so fucking
upset about, fuckhead?

Because I'm alienated.

Hey Hey, you like orgasms? Oh, yeah

Oh, Hey, hey, I'm at work
yesterday, bitch comes in,

orders a
twelve-inch pie with extra cheese.

So I ask her if she wanted me, like,
to carry that out to her car for her.

Bitch is obviously in
heat. "Yes, right away."

So I carry the pie out to her car. We
smoke a J.

She blows me. We eat the pizza,
I chase her with the beer.

Smoke, babe, slice, brew. All
four bases, fuckin' home run man

Your ability to fantasize is only
exceeded by your ability to lie.

Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh,
two weeks ago

we attended a concert
where I had fucked two girls.

No, that's, that's the ultimate
liar of liars. - And your mom.

No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you-hoo?

No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck
with the guy. I want the tickets.

Stuck, who? What guy?

Huh?
Shut up! Aw...

Look, you can't be out here
all night tonight, okay?

Hey, we're just having a conversation.

This is private property, my friend.

Hey, don't tell us about private property.
This is America, my friend.

Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay?
The customers complain.

We're your customers. We're
not complaining. - Please!

You don't need to sit
next to me right now.

Who were you talking to?

Nobody. Sooze.

Stuck with what guy?
What?

You said you didn't want to get
stuck with some guy. What guy?

No, uh, nobody. It's, uh,
it's my birthday this week

and Sooze's brother might come by
to wish me a happy birthday.

It's your birthday?
Yeah.

Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!

Happy birthday! Happy fuckin' birthday!

Happy...
That's good.

Um, is Sooze around?

Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.

Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?

I don't know.

Want a beer? Is Pony coming?
No, thanks. I don't drink.

Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did
she talk to him?

Pony? What's a "pony"?

You mean that geek who played the folk
music at the senior prom?

What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?

Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"?
Been on the road

opening for "Midnight Hore".
Stadiums, man.

Wait, so Pony's coming by here?

Didn't you see their video on MTV?
No, I shot my TV.

But, so, Pony's comin'
by here to the corner?

He's around and, you know,
maybe he's coming by.

Sooze told him to come by and hang
out, whatever. It's no big deal.

Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Oh, no, you

wanted to get together
with your close friend,

Pony, the rockstar. I understand.
So you, do you, want us to, leave?

No. We were just gonna go someplace
or something to... - We are?

Alright. She told him
to meet us here. Fuck.

Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.

Jeff, Jeff, if you
want to be alone with

Pony, you know, that's,
that's fine with us.

Sooze wants to see him.

Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I
gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.

Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's
he coming? - Yeah, when's he coming?

I don't know. Later. I don't know.

Yes!
Oh, fuck...

God, I haven't seen you all day.
You could've come over.

I know, I know, I know.
Oh! Trim it!

I hate that.
Sorry.

Let's go back to the van right now.
No.

I'm not going to the
van, it's so gross.

Come on. I'm doing
my performance right now.
Okay, so maybe later.

Oh! Jesus!

Fuck Oliver Stone.

Fuck Bill Clinton.

Fuck Howard Stern.

Fuck Michael Bolton.

Fuck O.J. Simpson.

Fuck Pope John Paul.

Fuck my dad.

Fuck all the men.

Fuck all the men!

Bang your head, blow your nose.

Run down the street, suck a hose.

Chew my lips, eat some shit.

Eat a stick of dynamite and
blow yourself to bits.

Shut your mouth, go away.
Drink my piss, have a nice day!

I hope you cry and never doubt.
I hope you die with blood in your mouth.

I hope your lies will no more shout
What's in my eyes, what's in your snout.

Youâ€™re a pig! I know that's true!
I dance a jig! Fuck you!

Fuck you! Fuck you!

Fuck you!

That was really great.

Was it okay?
Yeah!

What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.

Behind me. I'm making
these slides out of

these old pictures and
paintings and stuff.

Was that supposed to be me?

No.

Yes.

It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One

The Dialectical Expression
of Testosterone."

Isn't that a great title?

Why is everything about you, Jeff?

No, not, not everything.
This. I am the man in your life.

Man?

Yeah, man, male, significant
other, whatever the fuck I am.

It's a piece.

Youâ€™re sure as hell right about that.

I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff.

It's just part of my application
to the School of Visual Arts

...in New York.

Ah, you know people there?

I'm just gonna go. I figure the
worst I can do is starve to death.

"The worst I can do is starve
to death." Listen to you.

I don't want to hear it anymore.
No, no, no. Y-you know what?

Y-youâ€™re packing your bags,
you're jumping into

the unknown because
some conceptual artist

who teaches at a community college
is having a mid-life crisis

and he wants to sleep with
some girl half his age,

so he tells you you have talent.

Mister Brooks has had
shows in New York, Jeff.

He's been reviewed
in Art Forum. I think he knows.

Oh, well, then you better listen to him.

Well, fuck!

Might as well not do anything! Let's just
stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.

Yes, that's right. You know what, honey?
You should go to New York.

You should go. Go show 'em. They
need your unique point of view.

At least I have a point of view, you know?

I stand for something. And I'm
trying to communicate something.

What are you trying to communicate?
Tell us.

So you can give me more shit?

No, no. It's an honest question.
What are you trying to communicate?

I'm trying to communicate
how I feel, Jeff.

You know raise consciousness.
Make people think for a change.

"Burger Manifesto, Part One"
is gonna make people think?

Yes, you asshole.
About what?

About things that are important to me.
Like what?

Sexual politics, racism, the
environment, the military industrial...

Wait. Racism? You don't
know anybody who's black!

Of course I do!
Name one.

God, Karen Johnson.
One!

Youâ€™re completely missing the point.
I'm talking about idealism.

Responsibility, progress.
Yes.

No, idealism is guilty,
middle class bullshit.

No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.

No, no, no. I'm not
being cynical, I'm being

honest. - But do you
stand for anything?

Yes, I stand for...
What? What do you stand for?

I stand for honesty! I stand
for some level of truth!

Oh, yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.

You know, all you know
is what's good for you.

Can I talk?
Typical male.

Typical male.
Typical male.

Tim, he listens to you. Do you
think it's a good idea? Seriously?

Seriously?

It's a great idea.

Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.

I did. I split, man.

I expanded my horizons, you know.
Served my country.

Saw the world, you know?

I've gained wisdom and now I'm
back, baby,

back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.

I can't wait till Pony
gets here, you know?

Have a conversation
with a human being?

Well, if you love him so much,
why didn't you go see him play?

Um, because you didn't want to go.

Like I'm going to pay twenty
bucks to see Neil Moynihan

in some
band that I helped start.

Okay. Well, you know, he's always
been a nice guy and I like him.

He's a geek.

Hey, I've been, uh, making
these tapes, videotapes.

I ripped off
a camcorder up at the mall.

I thought, you know, it could be something
that I do, be a video artist, you know.

Ladies and gentlemen, Buff,
the postmodern idiot savant.

He will outdo us all.

It's safe, come on.

That's it.

That's it! I'm calling the police.

Why we're just standing here.

Look, youâ€™re trespassing.
Hey, call the cops!

Call 'em, call 'em right now, man.
Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up.

He'll definitely take your word over mine.
You can tell him about the trespassing.

I'll tell him about
how you sell beer to minors.

I'm not joking around now, okay?
Come on, let's go, let's go!

We're just standing here!
Just go and stand someplace else, okay?

You stand someplace else, man. You stand
someplace else. This is our corner.

You don't fucking own it!

Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours.
You don't belong here.

No, you don't belong here.
We were here before you.

Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

Hey, Tim.

No, see, sweetheart, you don't
want to stand up for parasite

'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here.

You know what? Tow
words, man: roll on.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what are you, huh?
You fucking drunk bum.

Yeah, you good-for-nothing.

You just, uh, hang around. On my
property.

The Hare Krishna's calling me a drunk.

Hey, listen, pal, you want
us to go?

Yeah, please, go. Come on.

Make a move.

Greasecake.

Towel-head.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.

Fucking drunk, huh?
You have the largest penis.

Can we go please?
Don't let 'em fight.

The dude wants it.
This is ridiculous!

Pakeesa?

It's okay. Come on. It's okay.

Come on, they're just
joking around.

Yeah, we're just screwing around.
Like Mohammed said.

Can't take a joke, man?

Hey, I hope you got a
permit for that, mama!

We're sorry, okay? We're gonna go.

Hey, youâ€™re gonna regret this.

Come on, Jeff.

Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Jeff! Let's go!

Hey, I'm sorry about that. It
was just a misunderstanding.

He was upset about something and he
took it out on you and I'm sorry. 'Bye.

No, I seriously doubt that
Pony's gonna be in a limo.

That's the rock star thing.
No, no.

Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him
right out of a triple-x video.

Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to
me! Stud! Oh! - Buff, Buff, Buff...

Sorry.
Jesus Christ.

You wanna bet he's with a girl?
No, he's not with a girl.

Oh, right. Oh, oh my God!
Pony, it's so huge!

You know what? He probably
gets bored with all that shit.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um,
how do you figure that?

I'd get bored.
I wouldn't.

If I were in his shoes, every
morning I'd get up singing, man.

Do my work-out, take a shower,
followed by a hearty breakfast,

steak and eggs, washed down
with a pot of hot coffee,

six pack of Coors Lite.

Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my
babe,

who would appear decked out
in her all-black leather

Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit.

So I'd, like, have to chew
off all her clothes until

she was completely nude.

Except she'd have these amazing
dragon tattoos all over her body

and pierced nipples with little
gold peace signs hanging from 'em.

And then she'd take out this half-ounce
of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines,

vaporize a few million brain
cells, screw for about an hour,

then spend the rest of the
morning trashed watching...

...Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man.

Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in
the afternoon?

Same, more of the same. Yep,
just keep doing the same

thing all the time, around
and around the clock.

With an occasional burger
or slice of thrown in

for our vitamins and energy.

Then, instead
of watching Gilligan,

we'd watch Captain Kirk.

That sounds so depressing. - Oh, come
on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!

No, I'm not saying that
I wouldn't love it. - Ah!

I'm saying no, I'm saying
after a while it'd wear thin.

Yeah, a long while.

A long, long while.
Watch out for that tree.

A long, long, long, long, while.
Okay, okay.

A long, long, long...
Okay.

Hey, Tim! Hold up.

It was a racial incident.

It was just something that got
out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?

It got that close.

Okay, but nothing happened.

Believe me, if I thought
something really bad

was going to happen, I
would've done something.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Okay, what would you have done?

I would've stopped it.
How?

I don't know. I would've done something.
This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it?

This place is so stupid. I can't believe
we're sitting here

in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all
these people

eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Jeff.

...like fucking robots.
Jeff

Look at those kids there.

You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks
yesterday. He has this friend in New York

who wants to sublet his apartment for
six-fifty a month.

I could swing that. Six-fifty.

Sooze.
What?

Did it ever occur to
you that I might have

some feelings about you
moving to New York?

What feelings?

Us.

Of course.

And?

Come with me.

No.

No, see, that's not what I'm saying.
I could go to New York if I wanted to,

but what's the point? So I can
learn how to order a cappuccino?

So I can get mugged by some crackhead?

So I can see, see
homeless people up close

and personal? - So
what do you wanna do?

Nothing.

No one does nothing, Jeff.

Okay, well, then, I'm
gonna break new ground.

New ground?
Mm-hm.

Taking one community college course
on the history of Nicaragua,

while barely holding a job packing boxes?

Okay, look. My job is not who I am.
I don't need that.

Why?
What's your goal? Status? Money?

Getting your picture on the
cover of some glossy magazine?

My goal is to make art.

So, what, why can't you do that here?
What's wrong with here?

Why is somewhere else better?

Why should I stay here, Jeff?

So we can sit on the corner and
watch the lights change,

while you bitch about Burnfield?

So I can spend the rest
of my life guessing

what it would be like to be
a real artist? - Oh, no.

So you and I can fuck while your parents
are out having dinner at the Sizzler?

What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?

I don't know.

Hey, great game Friday.
Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?

Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?

Just one?
Yeah.

You seen the new guy we got? Beavers?

The guy can pass.

Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. Do you
remember that game against North Reading?

When you passed to Pierce and he dropped
the ball? What do you think happened?

Do you think, like, he wasn't there or
were you short?

I don't, I don't remember. What do
I owe you? - Uh, eleven twenty-five.

<i>"In my head I'm really tall."</i>

<i>"My arms are big, not small."</i>

<i>"My hair is dark, on my back."</i>

<i>"Down straight, don't look back."</i>

<i>"In my heart, I am a star."</i>

<i>"Bigger than a guitar."</i>

Hey.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?

No I quit.

Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.

What's it about?

It's really not about anything.

Oh. Well, what's it on?

A cloud.

A cloud?

Yeah.

There was this cloud and I video taped it.

I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud.
It looks excellent on tape.

The video is like my head and,
and everything, you know, is, like,

is like in there that I see.

You know?

Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night
and walk around inside the Circle A

with the camera and tape shit.
Oh, that's so amazing.

I wish I could see it.
You can see it.

Whenever you want.

Don't you, um, work at a
hospital or something?

Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
You're a nurse?

No, I, you know, I help 'em out.
I empty bedpans

and bring 'em lunch.
That kind of thing.

Any gunshot victims?

Oh, some of 'em. But it's
mostly just strokes and shit.

I mean, most of 'em just sleep all
the time and get kind of yellow.

Usually they die id they're,
you know, really yellow.

Sounds like a bummer.

Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're
not all totally in a coma.

I mean, they know when I'm helping them.

Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?

Yeah.

I don't know.

Waiting, I guess. You know?

Do you wanna go to the van?

Now?

Yeah, we could hang out and
smoke a dube, you know?

I don't smoke dubes and I
don't really hang out.

But I'll go back. Okay.

Okay, whatever you want.

Shit.

Hey, Pony.

Hey, man.

Jeff.

How're you doin?

Good, man.
Wow, man.

The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.

Well, shit, man, you've only been gone
for a year, man, Is that your limo?

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company,
they make me use it, you know.

I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...

Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol.
Wow, huh?

Yeah, hey I saw your album
at Musicland up at the mall.

Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good
placement and shit like that, you know.

We sold, uh, over ninety
thousand units and uh...

and Danny says that we're
gonna get a gold record.

Wow. A gold record, man, that's great.
So you're,

you're like living the
wild life now, huh?

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

Aw, come on. Rock star.
Fame. Fortune. Sex.

Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know.
It's hard work, you know?

The road's hell, you know? I
mean airport, hotel, show.

And airport, hotel, show.
Airport, hotel, show. I mean,

fuck, man, you know?
You still living at your mom's?

Yeah, I crash there.
Yeah, good.

Yeah, most nights I'm just
sleeping on the couch.

Yeah, that sounds cool. Great.

He says we got to be at the radio station
at seven a.m. Can you handle that?

Oh, sure.
Hi. I'm Erica.

Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.

Jeff, Erica. God, it's so
amazing to be back home.

Oh, wow.

I mean, we've been playing
big places everywhere,

but when we did that sound check at
The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me.

I'm playing
The Orpheum, you know?

I mean, the last time I played here was,
uh, the prom.

The prom. That's funny.

Hey, I though you guys were
coming to the show, man?

Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh,
Sooze, screwed up the tickets.

Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.

We were? - Oh, yeah, it was
a great show. You guys missed it.

Sorry.
So how's college?

I dropped out. I mean, uh,
you know, this semester I'm

taking a, a class, you know,
three nights a week.

But I'm just try-trying
to think and work on stuff, you know?

I've been doing some
writing, though. Short pieces, you know.

I love writing. A-Anne Rice?
I love Anne Rice.

Short pieces, huh? You
should try to write songs.

You know, I've thought
about that, actually.

No, man, I mean it.
You're a good writer.

I remember those things you'd write
during honors English. Funny shit.

He wrote this thing
about his dick once and

he read it in front
of the whole class.

I'd love to read that.
Funny shit, man.

So you think I should?
What?

Write. 'Cause I, I have
written some things.

Like songs?
Yeah, they could be songs.

Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?

Yeah, really.
Now?

Yeah.
Great.

Yeah, maybe later.

Hey! Hey!
Pony, oh my god! You showed up.

Holy shit! Look at this car, man!

Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?

It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.

Look at you!

Hey, you look good. Like you,
you know, head's in a good

place, you know? You, are
still doing your painting?

Sometimes, yeah. You know, I
started to do performances.

Oh, yeah?

So? What's L.A. like?

It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?

Yeah.
Like?

Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager
Danny took us to this restaurant

and there was Sandra Bernhard.
No, she was just sitting there?!

Oh, yeah, just sitting there
eatin' a salad, you know.

That kind of thing happens
all the time in L.A.

It's, you know... I met
Johnny Depp.

You did? I love him. Yeah, you know,
I'm thinking of moving to New York.

New York, huh? - Yeah. To go to school
and, you know, paint, performances, paint.

You have to go. You always did
such, uh, you know, great work.

I still have some of those drawings
that you'd do in study hall.

You do not!
I do.

Jeff, don't you think Sooze should
go to New York and, uh, you know.

Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah.
She should.

Hey, yes!

Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!

Oh, you were there?
No, but I heard it was great.

Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.

Hi.
How're you doing? Nice to meet you.

So tell us, man. Party time, trashin'
hotel rooms, babes around the clock?

Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

Oh, So what about her? - Oh, uh, Erica?
Erica is the publicist for the band.

Hi, I'm Erica.
Hey, I'm Sooze.

Yeah, right, publicist.
Nice to meet you Sooze.

Yeah, she, uh, works for the
record company and takes

care of interviews and,
you know, shit like that,

Uh, we were actually
just doin' an interview

and Erica said she's like to see
Burnfield, so...

So, do you guys want to do something,
go someplace or something like that?

So, we're all old friends of Pony's.
We go way back to our childhood.

Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield.
We all hear about Burnfield.

Mm. You know, does he tell you about how,
uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?

Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah.

Well, I helped start it, but, you
know, uh... - Well, not exactly.

For a while.

Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times.
You know, I mean, you play harmonica,

but that was before we were really a
band, you know, before Danny signed us.

Yeah, well, I, I came by
more than a couple times.

So you came by to see how
the other half lives,

huh? Well, here we are,
What do you think?

Pretty fucking pathetic huh?

Kind of like one of those
documentaries on educational TV?

It's nice here. It's different.

Yeah, totally.
So, uh, what do they interview you about?

Well, uh, there's this benefit
for Rwanda we're gonna do. And,

uh, you know, my songs,
uh, where I get the

ideas for them, uh, you
know, stuff like that.

Where do you get your ideas?
Leave him alone, Tim

Uh, excuse me, I'd like to
know where he gets his ideas.

Tim's jealous, you know? He
wants to have ideas too.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots
who are named after animals.

Jeff!

You're not his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.

Mm. And youâ€™re like, what else?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?

Well, that's one way of putting it.
Am I fucking him?

Shit. - Pony, what would
you say our relationship is?

Um, mother-daughter.

Pony and I are friends.
So, then, you're, like, available?

In what way?

Mm, in a horizontal

and wet way!
Ew! Oh, Buff!

Relax!

Why don't you fucking relax? He's
having verbal intercourse, Sooze.

No, he's not. He's objectifying her and
he's entertaining us at her expense.

Oh, it's okay. What's your name?

Buff.
Buff is funny. God.

Buff is funny, okay?
She likes Buff, so why

don't you whip shut
the feminist hole.

Hey, why don't you swallow
your cock and choke

on it? Oh, I forgot,
it's not big enough.

So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are
you staying at your mother's house?

No, no, they, uh, you know, that
can be kind of a hassle, so,

uh, you know, I just stay at
the Four Seasons. It's easier.

Yeah, yeah, I stay at the
Four Seas, it's ease.

Wow, that must be pretty nice there.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you
know, it's a bed and hot water.

It does look good.

Yeah, so what do you guys do next?
I mean, what's your band do now?

Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio
and we're, we're doin' a new album.

Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze,

you could do the cover.

You do not want me to do your cover.
I don't want you to do the cover,

I need you to do the cover.
You're not serious.

I'm always serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.

I get final approval. It's in
my contract. - Would I get paid?

Yeah, we'd have to fly you out
for meetings, you know. - Yeah?

Oh, God, that would be
something I really want to do.

Hey, can you cash this?
Yeah.

Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff

So where are you?
I'm here.

Yeah man, your band is really cool.
It's really great.

Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay?

Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good
'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man.

You know? I mean, I forgot
what it was like to just hang out.

And you know why it's so good?
See, because,

see, you guys are real.
No, man, I mean it.

You guys have a sense of humor.
You live

your lives, you know.
It's simple, you know.

The guys on the road, I mean, the band,
all they talk about is scoring chicks...

and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.

Yeah, we're all above that.

See, I wrote something about all this.

Uh, it, it's a song about...
Well, play it, man.

Yeah, come on, play it.
Oh, no, man. I can't.

Play it! Come on!
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.

Please.
I just started it.

I don't care. I'm gonna drop it.
I'm gonna drop it. I'm...

Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!

Yes! Free concert!

Alright, Pony!
Alright, alright.

Yes! Hey, unplugged Pony!

Thank you.

Hey, I'm glad you put truth in
your song, man. That's important.

Hey, thanks, man.

So who are you?

What do you mean?

Well, if we're, like, the man
invisible, what are you?

I don't know.

I'm an artist, I guess. You
know, there's life and then

there's the people watching
the life, commenting on it.

Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What?

Comment, say things, think. Whatever.
Why are you so special?

Well, I, I didn't say I was special,
but it's one thing, you know,

and it's another thing
to actually communicate

it to people. You
know what I mean?

If a tree falls in a forest and no
one hears it, does that make a sound?

Of course it does.
You know, that is my worst fear.

Making a sound and no one hears it.
Mine too.

W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
You know what I'm saying?

Sure. You make art
and you want people to

see it. - Wait, what
happened to the tree?

Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree
is not artistic if no one cuts it down.

Jeff likes to argue for
the sake of arguing.

No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

No, I don't.
You do.

No, I don't.

Hi.
Hi.

So you, like, come from
a town like this or...?

No, not really. I come from an "area".
Bel Air.

You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.

Oh, me too. Middle-class.

Maybe upper-middle-class.

He is?

Yes. He is.
He is.

And you love him a lot.
He bought you a BMW

you finally had to

move out and get your own place. I mean, I
know, it's time to leave the nest.

FUCK!

Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing,
we would've gone to your concert!

Jeff!
So you sold ninety thousand units.

So what? Does that mean you're
a genius? You're a great artist?

You're higher up the ladder? You got an
extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?

Wow, you're cute when you're angry.

Why don't you write a song about
Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?

Jesus, Jeff.

Hey, man, uh, look, if
you don't like my stuff,

uh, I won't sing it, okay?
I'm sorry, you know?

No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying I don't

need a limousine to
know who I am, alright?

Right on. You know what? He
doesn't need the limo, man.

I mean, you know, at least
I admit that I don't know.

I know that
things are fucked up beyond belief

and I know that I have nothing
original to say about any of it, alright?

I don't have an answer.
I don't have a fucking message.

Okay, great. Well, now he's crying.
Are you guys happy?

Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man

I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no.

Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry

if I said something wrong. I, I...
No, man. Hey. No, you know what?

Hey, it's you, man. It's, you
know what, you know what it is?

It's this tarpit of stupidity
that we're all stuck in.

It's this cell. It's this void, you know.

Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know,
it's me, okay? I come out here

and I'm, so used to
everyone, you know, kissing

my ass and I think I'm
a fucking star, man,

and I'm really sorry if
I'm full of attitude. I, I

really... - No, you know what?
It's not you, man.

It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Look, man, it...

Shit. Why don't we get
something to eat? I mean

food?
We'd have to hurry.

China Gate's open till midnight.

George can drive us. There's
plenty of room in the car.

Jeff?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead

and bring back something here. Yeah.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean,

I want to hear about those songs
you've been working on. You too, Buff.

Limo ride!

Tim?
Uh, I didn't write any songs.

You guys go ahead. I gotta stay
here and guard the parking lot.

Come on.
No. No, no, no.

Come on. I'm not gonna
go if you don't come.

No, I just don't feel like it.
That's all.

Why don't you just try? Please.
For me. Come on.

Hey, come on, man! Limo!

Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee?

Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did
you guys see where she went?

Erica, you coming?

Are you sure? Okay.

Okay.

You got everything right but the car.
My dad didn't get me a BMW.

What'd he get you?
A Porsche.

Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.

You just seem to know all
these things about me

and I don't know anything
about you, you know.

What kind of music do you like?

Military marching bands.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.

Now, how the hell would you know
what I think? Hm? You don't know me.

I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?

You know, it was the biggest
mistake of my life. - Really?

Well, I mean, you have to understand I
was just this dopey kid mopping floors

and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I
enlisted right out of high school. So,

I just wanted something different in
my life.

"It's not a job, it's an adventure."
Right? I hated it. I had to get out.

So I was working in
the kitchen, chopping

lettuce, you know, real
heroic stuff, and I,

I had this big fucking knife and I
chopped off the tip of my little finger

and three days later I was a free man.

You cut off your little finger?
Well, they,

uh they were nice enough
to sew it back on.

Honorable discharge.
Disabled while serving.

I get a check every month.

Um, four for smoking, please.
Closed, closed.

Oh, man, no closed, we just got here!
Midnight closed.

Oh, come on! We're hungry. Please?

Yo, do you know who
this guy is right here?

That's Pony Moynihan from MTV.

Yeah look at his limo out there.

TV?
MTV.

What? You're going to turn him away?
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.

He's probably the most famous guy
that'd ever come in this place.

You're lucky he's here.

Yeah.

Take-out only. Wait, I get picture.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks. See man?

You know? I remember coming
here with my parents.

You know, I should, um, make a video of
this place. You know, bring the camera in.

You make videos? - Oh, yeah, all
the time. That's what I do now.

You know what would be cool is,
like, to do a music video,

you know? But, like, you
know, have it set in here.

You know, like, like, like,
with her and shit. You

know, like, you know, like,
"Closed, closed, closed."

"Closed, closed, closed." But
with your music. - You could do it.

I could.

Yeah!
Yeah.

I mean, do you have something I could show
my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?

Yes!
Yeah!

A reel?

I mean, what is there to
be happy about really?

I mean, going to the gym,
climbing the StairMaster,

eating the yogurt,
checking the voice mail.

Smoking the low-tar cigarettes,

shaving the bikini line.

Sometimes I just want something
different, you know?

What was your name again?
Erica.

Erica. So do you think you
and I are alike, Erica?

Deep down. Way down.

It's a mistake to think that. - We could
still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.

It's nice to do a lot of things.
That's what I mean.

I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.

Yeah?
Mm-hm.

I'm a big girl.

I can take care of myself. If I didn't
want to be here,

I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch
of kids looking for Chinese food.

No, no, see, you, you don't know.
No?

So teach me a lesson.

Hey, when I get shitfaced I
can get this huge appetite.

God.

I don't know why. Most people
don't, but I do. Whoo!

You okay, man?

You okay?

I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.

Wait, do the windows, okay? Just do 'em.

Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
You done?

Yeah.

Oh, crap!

Oh, oh, hi. Oh, Missus Douglas, I
hope I'm not calling too late.

No, have you seen Bee-Bee?
Well, no, yeah, she was,

I was just wondering if you'd seen her.
She did? Okay.

Yeah. No, I'm sorry to bother you,
Missus Douglas. Okay, 'bye.

Shit. She always answers.

Hey! Hey, you guys!
No. No. Put back the leprechaun.

Oh, fuck.
Go!

What are you doing, you idiot?

Open the damn door!
Open, open, open, open!

Go, go, go, come on! Come on!

Go!
Go!

Oh, man, don't be gettin' soft on me.
I mean, sorry, it's ok.

It's okay, just don't think, okay?
Just don't think.

"Black and orange
Black and orange
Hear that hearty yell
Rah rah rah"

"G, O, F, O, R, I, T. Go for it!"

Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.

Oh, man. Wow. I was never
into football, you know?

I gotta take a piss. Do you mind
if we pull over really quickly?

Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.

George. Pull over.

Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.

Burnfield. No place like it.

Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and
Puke capital of the world.

I can't believe you're still here.
I'm moving.

If...
No, I'm going.

Yeep.
What's that supposed to mean?

I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.

That's because I am.

It's okay.

This kind of thing happens.

It's just never happened to me.

I'm sorry.

It's true though. Mm.

So, um, what's your
TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?

Taking Care of Business.

I'm sorry.

I hate it here.

It's so ugly, it's like being dead.

You got out
of here, you know? I'm ready to go.

Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out
why I left in the first place, you know?

I think about people and I
wonder what they're doing.

Yeah.
I think about you.

A lot.
Me?

Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

Yeah, you know, when you called I
thought, there's a name from the past.

Or the future.

Oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be
working on that album cover, right?

Yeah, I know what you're saying.
You do?

Yeah.

God, you showed up at such
a weird time in my life.

I just walked all the way
from Westside to here.

I haven't walked that
far since junior high.

I thought you didn't drink.
I don't anymore.

Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.

You know, one moment
things are so fucked up

than you look at it from a
totally different angle

and it makes sense.
Yeah.

Did you ever hear that saying,
"This too shall pass"?

Sure, all the time, in Group.

In Group?

Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go

once a week. It's kind of like AA.

Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate.

That must've been intense.

Intense.

How long were you in there?
Uh, ninety days.

And now I just have to go once a week.
See, I'm rehabilitated.

Well, you shouldn't drink.
Are you gonna drink? - No.

Oh, maybe. Fuck.

I mean, that would suck if
you had to go back to rehab.

Yeah, it would suck big time.
I'd kill myself first.

It was pretty bad, huh?

It was like hell with windows. You
know, there's shit on the walls.

Kids my age sucking their thumbs.

I mean, every day I would,
I'd wake up in my cell

and I'd think, my parents put me
here. Why? Why?

Because I stayed out all night one time.

Uh, because I broke the
VCR when I was drunk.

Because I was out of control.

I thought my parents loved me.

Hey, do you got any water? And some B-One?

Hey, where did everybody go?

Hey, hey. Okay?
Sor-sorry, Bruce.

We were all riding around and it
suddenly hit me what we were doing.

We were getting off on the fact that

we're in a car teen feet
longer than all the rest.

And I got out and I just
started walking. - Yeah.

Well, what it was... I, I
don't want to admit it, but,

you know, I was jealous of Pony.

Well, sure, he's rich
and he's famous. He's

got everything and
you've got nothing.

Yeah, but, when I was walking,

I realized that he's stuck in that
limo all the time.

He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck
with his autograph,

he has to do whatever his manager
tells him to do, you know?

He's not free. He's just
part of the machine,

and if you think about it, freedom's
all that there really is.

Yeah, I guess.

You know? And it used to
scare me so much that

I didn't know what was
coming in my life.

You know, like, like,
I would always think,

uh, you know, what if I
make the wrong move?

But maybe there isn't any right move.

I mean, look at us. You know, we all
dress the same, we all talk the same,

we all fuck the same, we
all watch the same TV.

Nobody's really different, even
if they think they're different.

"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"

And see, that's what makes me free.
Because I can do anything I want,

as long as I don't care about the result.

Anything is possible. It
is night on planet earth

and I'm alive.

And someday I'll be dead. Someday
I'll just be bones in a box,

but right now, I', not.
And anything is possible.

And that's why
I can go to New York with Sooze

because each moment can just be
what it is.

There's no failure, there's no mistake.
I just, I just go there

and live there and what happens, happens.

And so, right now I'm getting
naked and I'm not afraid.

I don't need money, man. I don't, I don't
even need, I don't even need a future.

I, I could knock out all of my teeth
with a hammer. So what?!

You know, I could poke my eyes out. I'd
still be alive, you know?

At least I'd know that
I was doing something

real for two or three
seconds, you know?

It's all about
feat and I'm not afraid anymore, man.

Fuck it! Fuck fear!

Bravo, you son-of-a-bitch!

Is that Jeff?
Oh my God...

Do you ever wake up in the morning and
think, "Well, here's another day"?

You know? It's just like the last
one.

I mean what difference
does it make, you know.

You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?

"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Really? What else does your mother say?

Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.

Hey, where did you go? We
were worried about you.

Uh, home, you know. - Yeah, I talked
to your mom. I think I woke her up.

I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
You didn't get me in trouble.

Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.

Gee, Jeff, I thought you
were gonna go take a

piss, not join some
alcoholic nudist colony.

No, no. I just got sick
and tired of listening

to that demo tape over and
over again, you know?

I mean, I felt like a
fucking groupie, you know.

Mm. I enjoyed the ride.
Sorry you didn't.

But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight.

I'm so sorry.
What?

No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got
out of the car I walked all the way here.

And I fig-and I figured something out.
Oh, yeah?

Hey! On behalf of Burnfield,

I present to you the keys to the city.

So, how was the ride, kids?
Great.

Really? - It was the nicest
thin I've done in a long time.

Oh that's nice for you.
Where's Erica?

You seen her? - Erica? She said she
was tired. She went back to the hotel.

Oh, How'd she get back?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab.

Is there any hot mustard?
I don't know.

They are old, we are young,
they are fast, we are fun.

Buff. What a fuck?

Sooze, I, I have to talk to you,
'cause... - God, you smell like whiskey.

No, no, I have to talk to you.
Is that a threat?

I ate a dog when I was in Thailand.

Tasted exactly like this
sparerib.

No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Forget about New

York, Jeff. I don't want to
talk about New York anymore.

There was this other
place where they served

live monkey brains. Sweat to God.
You walk in,

they bring the little monkey out,
shave his head,

crack it open, and you eat it's
brains while it's still alive.

I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't
have any money and my mom has a saying:

"Don't write any checks you can't cash".

Tim, what are you talking about?
Ask your girlfriend.

Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's
just no answer. - What are you? Her pimp?

She said she might
go get a drink first.

Well, I mean, she always
answers her beeper.

Pal, she's a big girl, you know?
I'm sure

she's alright. - Yeah?
Well, what'd she say?

About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?

She didn't say. Maybe
she's at the bar at the

hotel. - The bar at the hotel?
She told you that?

What did she say exactly?
Well, Dad...

she said she wanted to suck my cock.

Okay?
She might wanna such your cock, too.

Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
I think I gotta go.

What? Oh, come on. You're
not gonna suck my cock?

Fuck you, man.

I never did anything to you!

Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking
language, alright? Or I might have to.

Whatever.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding.

Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive,
huh? You know, there's a life on the road?

Don't do that, man, okay?
Could you give me a ride?

Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride,
the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.

Tim, go throw up somewhere.
You know, man,

it's none of your
business what I do, okay?

It's none of my business?
Yeah.

Oh, okay, it's none of my business.
Yeah, so,

you-you're trying to fuck
my best friend's girlfriend

and it's none of my business?!
What the fuck are you talking about?!

Nobody's fucking anybody!
No, see, Neil,

if you're fucking with
one of my friends,

then you're fucking with me.
Don't do that.

What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...

...my manager will slap
an assault charge on

your ass faster than
you can say AA, okay?

Your manager?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.

You know, have 'em call me.
Y-you know where to

find me, right? - Oh, yeah,
drunk on the corner, man.

Hey, why don't you buy another beer.
It's on me, okay? - Thanks, man!

I'll be in the car, okay?

Wait a minute, Sooze.
What are you doing?

I'm leaving. Is that
alright with you?

Do I have your permission?
Maybe you want to think about it.

Where are you going?
For a ride.

Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.

To his hotel?
Shit, Jeff!

You know what we should do? Go to the...
So you can do an album cover?

I've run out of words.
Wait. What, what are you saying?

I don't know. And I don't care that
I don't know. - Well, what about us?

What about us? I'm moving
away your staying here.

No, maybe not though. That,
that's what I'm trying to say.

Maybe not? You think that I'm with
somebody else and now it's maybe not?

Oh, no, no, no.
You're unbelievable.

Wait, no, I... Look,
Sooze, I figured

something out. - You did, huh?
Good for you.

Oh, fuck it, man!
Fuck it!

You know what? Go with him.
Just go with him.

In the limo!!!
Do your covers and all that shit.

'Bye, Jeff.

Go.
What?

Just go.

You really suck, you know that?

Just go.

To women.

They're all whores.

Let us not forget what Chenowsky said.

"The greatest men are the most alone."

And without suffering, Jeffery,
you will never gain wisdom.

I'm not suffering, you know.
I don't give a shit.

Good. That's good.

You know I've realized somethig, man.
It's not a big deal.

You know, I'm not jealous
of Pony, you know.

Yeah, no, you're right.
It's no big deal, you know.

Guy probably has his arm around
her right now, holding her close,

nudging her titty with his elbow, talking
about the deep significance of his music,

while she looks up at him with her big
brown eyes.

In a few minutes they'll be
back at the Four Seasons.

You ever, you ever stayed
in one of those places?

No.

Well, it ain't no pup tent in the
garage, you know what I mean?

Fuck. So they'll talk and talk.
They'll probably talk all night.

And, oh, they'll decide that they're
gonna spend the night together, right?

But, you know, they're
gonna keep their

underwear on and they're
not gonna do anything.

By six a.m.

he's parking the pink Cadillac.

Fuck.

There's really only one answer.

What?

Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em.
You know what I mean?

Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!

Fuck 'em!

Fuck 'em all, man!
Yeah.

Yes! Youâ€™re learning, kid. That's right!
You're learning.

Oh, it's the man.

What's up guys? - Uh, you know,
just admiring the scenery, you know?

This one.He causes all the trouble.
Been drinking again, Timmy-boy?

You were a shitty lineman
and now youâ€™re a shitty cop.

Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.

Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Who's

going to slow me down?
You, you fat pig.

Alright, get in the car before
I have to embarrass you in

front of your friend. - Hey,
Gary, how's the divorce comin'?

Asshole.

Cuff him and stuff him.

Get in, sir!
Okay. We'll go for a ride.

Can you tell me what happened?

Ele est+AOE-b+AOo-bado. Causando
problemas. Estava aqui antes.

He's drunk.
Aha.

You gotta help me out, man.
I'm in trouble.

Oh, no, no, no. This
is no big deal, you

know? I can come down
and, and get you out.

No, no. I'm not, I'm not
talking about this.

I did a bad thing, Jeff.
What? What'd you do?

That chick, Erica?

Well, w-what happened? - Well, I, you
know, I took her to the van, you know.

It was goin' all hot and heavy

and she started hanging on me, you know?
And she started crying,

"Tim, Tim, what's the matter?
I love you. Don't go!"

And I was just looking at her
stupid face and her stupid eyes,

stupid mouth

and I was filled with disgust, man.
And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...

What'd you do?

I hit her.
You hit her?

Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit
her? - Because I was fucked up, man.

I just kept hittin' her
till she didn't move anymore.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.
She's unconscious?

Go look, man.

Go look. Go see for yourself,
if you got the guts.

You know, this, what you're
doing with your life...

I don't know.

You know, it's not you. You know?
You seem like a smart guy.

Yeah, well, thank you
for the advice, but you

wouldn't understand what
is going on with me.

Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
That's right.

Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?

Erica?

Hey! Whoa, you look like
shit. You been home yet? - No.

Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what
we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hang on.

Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man.
A long, long, long...

night.

Hi, uh, yeah, I'd, like to report a...
What? No, yeah, no, I'd like to report a,

report a crime.

No, I can't hold, I don't... alright.

Hey. Hey. Are you trying to
get a hold of Sooze? - No.

It's gonna be a beautiful
fucking day, man.

Oh, God! Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two!

Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you.
It's okay. Enjoy yourself.

Are you talking to me?
It's okay.

Glad it's okay.
I'll tell you what.

When I get my engineering degree and I'm
swimming in my swimming pool,

it will be very fucking okay.

Um, if you're talking
to me, could you make

some sense? 'Cause I
don't speak Swahili.

In two more years I'll have an engineering
degree. We'll sell the store,

we'll move away from Burnfield and
the store and you standing here.

Good. See you later.
You're a drunk and an idiot.

You're wife sucks my cock every
night, swallows my cum and loves it.

That's okay. - Yeah it's okay. You
know, we have a saying back home:

"Either the salt is rotten or the meat."

Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart,
chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.

Ah, that's nice. They
have many convenience

stores there for you
to stand in front of.

Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.

She was at the Four Seasons last night,
man. But you shouldn't worry about that.

No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm
not worried. - No. Life is too short.

No, I'm not worried.
Good.

Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell
you something and, uh, you

got, you got, you gotta promise
not to tell anyone, alright?

No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.

Buff, look at me for a second.
No, this is serious.

Yeah.

Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man,

I know. You're my friend,
she's your old lady. - No, no.

I feel really bad about that, but
I was busy, you know, I mean...

No, look, this is not
about Sooze, alright.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed
at the Four Seasons last night with

Pony? - Yeah, we all stayed at the
Four Seasons, man. It was party time.

I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager.
Really nice guy.

We talked about the video. They want a
raw look. Something fresh. Danny said

if I can capture the reality of
Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.

Okay, Buff, listen
to me for a second

alright? - No, I know
what you're going to say.

I don't know anything about
making a video. But that's a plus.

Because since I'm just starting out,
I've got a fresh point of view,

and that's good for, you know,
marketing, demographics...

Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
But I'd,

I'd do it for free. You
know, just for my reel.

Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.

No, shut up!

Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.

You know? - Yeah, that's what I'm
trying to tell you. That chick Erica?

What, they're looking for her? - No man,
she showed up last night at the hotel.

We had a great time together. I stayed in
her room last night, man. What can I say?

Wait a minute. You
saw Erica last night?

Yeah, I saw all of
Erica last night, man.

Buff, you got to stop making shit up.
It didn't happen.

Y-s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.

Wait. Hey, man.

Erica is in the van back there.
What?

Look. She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?

Buff... She's dead.
She's dead?

Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.

Bullshit.
No, no, no.

That's bullshit. That's total utter
bullshit. - Oh, really? You wanna go look?

Yeah, man - Let's go look,
then. Let's go look, then!

Look! Look!

Cock-a-doole-doo! Good morning!

I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?

Playing with something really hot.
Yeah?

Oh, my God, you found it.
Thank you so much.

Did you get your tape?

Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got
to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel,

and if I get the gig, Erica is
gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.

Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if
you don't get the gig. - I can come visit?

You better! Yes!
I will.

It was really nice meeting you, Jeff.
If you're

ever in L.A., you should
come by the offices.

I talked to Pony earlier. He said he
had a really nice time

and he's really looking forward to reading
some of your songs.

Yeah, tell Pony to go fuck himself.

Okay, I'll do that.

Okay, hurry up.

Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!

Not dead! Definitely not dead!

Guess not.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.

No.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man.

That guy's sad, man.

Well, uh, I gotta go, but,
uh, listen, if I don't

come back, I'll send a
video of me surfing.

Alright, man? Get some rest. Go
with the flow. - Alright, Buff.

Hey, George.

Hey, man.
Hey.

They let you out?
Yeah, of course they let me out.

Chickenshits.

I gotta pay some class
C misdemeanor ticket.

So did I call it or did I call it?

She spent the night, didn't she? Hm?

Oh, that sucks for you, pal.

Oh, shit.

You lied to me.

You want to know what your problem is,
Jeff? You want to believe so bad,

you'll buy anything. It's true.
Look at you.

You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all.

No, I stayed up all night trying to
figure out how to protect my best friend.

Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to
come up with some lie so that

you wouldn't have to go to jail
for the rest of your life.

Wow. You did that for me?
Yes.

Well, you know, all I can say is,

you're a fucking fool.

Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?

Oh, Jeff, give me a break.
You didn't even

have the guts to go look
in the van, did you?

You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to
me. You lied to me because you're gutless.

You're a gutless, drunken looser.

I'm a loser.

And I'm drunk.

But I'm not gutless.

You know, and what are you
doing here in the first

place, man? He's just gonna
call the cops again.

Good, good. I, I hope he does.
The sun

hasn't even come up yet
and you're drinking.

Hey, you saw that brown bitch
point a gun at me last

night, man. Did you think
she was gonna use it?

Did you think she was gonna use it?

I don't know.

You don't know?
Come on.

You don't think that
after they called the

cops on me, her and
Mohammed had a nice laugh?

No.
No?

I disagree. I think they did. I think
they probably went home last night and,

you know, kicked off their
sandals and had a nice

laugh about the drunk on
the corner, you know?

Makes me sick.

What are, what are you doing?

Look, Tim, just go home. Alright.
Go home and sleep it off.

Well, what am I supposed to sleep off?
My life?

You know, I'm supposed
to go home and go to

sleep and when I wake
up, what'll I be, Jeff?

A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback
or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right?

I don't think so, man.
Just go home, alright?

This is my home.

Why, why did you start this in the
first place, man? They never hurt you.

They never hurt me? They hurt me
every day with their attitude.

You know, like they even have a right.
Who the fuck do they think they are?

Let me tell you something, I was
born here. Alright? I'm an American.

And I'm owed something.
Look, they took it from me.

They're just people. Alright?
They got feelings, you know?

What about my feelings? What
about my fucking feelings?

These assholes, they come over here,
they know all the answers, right?

Well, they don't know shit.

Will you just put the gun down?
No.

Just put it down.
What is this... now, huh?

Jeff, stay there.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.

Well, then, there now, why don't
you go inside and call the

cops and I'll come in there and
blow your fucking brains out.

Why should I call the police, huh?
They don't so any good.

Well, you gotta call your wife
then, you know, 'cause she kind of

handles these heavy
matters anyway, right?

No. No, you see, I don't
have to call my wife.

Well, what about this?
What about this, huh?

Go ahead, big man.

Camel jockey.
You know, why do you call me names?

You know, I never hurt you.
I'm only working

here. - Yeah, yeah. That's
the fucking problem.

No, wait, wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

What is your name?
Look, why do you care, huh?

Because maybe if we know each other's
names, things wouldn't get like this.

My name's Jeff.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?

Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!

Hey, w-why don't you see if he's
hiring, you know? Get an application?

That, that's Indian?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.

Alright, alright, enough
with the Boy Scout routine.

Please. Look...
Please?

Look, look, just get off my property.
What?

Look, get down off my property.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh?

You're gonna shoot me for standing
on your fucking trash can?

Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.

Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.

Go ahead! They love
you just about as much

as I do. - Tim, can we go?
This is ridiculous.

Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!

Get off my fucking roof, you
fucking drunk! You bum!

Oh, there you are, honey. We were
waiting for you. What happened?

Look, get down now, you fucking drunk!
You bum! - You know what? Go ahead

and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me!
Come on! Come on, man! Come on!

Get off my roof!

Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!

Look; okay, come on. Look,
what are you doing? Look,

that's enough. My wife called the police.
They're coming.

Jeff! Come up here!

Is that Bee-Bee?

Come on!

Look, look, you see? They were
drinking on the roof and,

what, is she drunk? J-just get her off!

What are you saying?

Ready?

What are you saying? Please...

You got her? Fuck.

I hope you're happy!
This has nothing to do with me.

This, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.

No, no, she went up by herself.
This was not my responsibility.

Hey it's your roof. It's
your fucking problem.

Hi, uh, there's an emergency down
at the Circle A on first Street.

Okay. You're fucked now, pal!
Um, send an ambulance

'cause I, I think it's an
overdose or something. Okay.

Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here.

I'm gonna go over to Scuff's
and see if he's got his truck.

Listen, if she dies, you're
gonna be so sorry that

you ever showed your
brown face in this town!

This has nothing to do with me!
She went up by herself.

Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof!
They can't go on the roof!

How is she?
I don't know.

I think she's breathing. - Okay.
Okay, look my wife called the police.

They're coming. It's not too late.
They'll come, they'll take care of her.

I'm going inside. Oh, God.

You people are so stupid!
What's wrong with you?!

Throw it all away, huh?!
You throw it all away!
