I think ... know ... what they do is fantastic

the two have been through this,

and know the shit that must withstand

when they see the same person every day.

For us it is absolutely the best arrangement,

because we're both very busy,

I work by day, by night she

I can see the Knicks without interruption ...

I get up at noon,

I take a coffee in peace without having to talk to anyone

or comment as I like the rings.

What we are saying is that actually

not have to do ever.

Exactly

Therefore we do not have to endure the attacks of other

-Hmm!

Absence makes everything more fun

And it makes sex hotter

Oh, beware the details! -Is true

I did not tell what we did?

Contále! - Is pretty good ...

Is your face ... like, baby?

Oh. is a little sore

So are "friends with benefits"

but with papers, right?

No, no! listen to me!

We are both in our second marriage

and we are trying to be a little more realistic

this time, about what we need ...

... Or we do not need

I am fully aware

since my last blowjob and I'm fine with it

Enough!

is supposed to have a nice lunch!

I have no idea what it means

traducirmelo could you?

No. .. I think about many things

and I think eventually

you will gain a great blowjob

When we met I really felt

we were perfectly compatible

but then began to haunt both

I think ... what ...

we started to distance ourselves, right?

this fucking ... this fucking!

of course we are very much in love!

Very! - Somehow it again more sensitive.

Oh ... I'm obsessed with the whole relationship,

what I mean is that my sister and I

were educated in a home very, very Catholic

and ... taught us that ...

that marriage is ... is ... sacred!

and to be respectful of it

and ... do not know ...

talk about oral sex at lunch ...

not being respectful.

I heard that if you wake up at least

once a week, look at your partner and you think:

"I made a serious error"

then something is really wrong

with your marriage

Marsha feels that way every morning

then? that is normal too?

Listen ... this conversation is very,

very annoying for me.

No. .. Yes it is.

Marriage is something very special

Oh, yes it is.

is a sacrament, it is!

should be married by that ...

want to spend their life together!

not because she sucks good ...

I think you missed the point

she does not "blow jobs" at all!

Enough!

The problem with your argument is that

We are not married by ...

by ... something special ... a sacrament .... or ...

because they are deeply in love

So I got married!

After 18 years together

going to reveal something else?

you said 18?-Wau, it sounds amazing!

I know. I just said ... OK

when you suggested it, we were in love, ok?-Yes!

well ... when I imagined my life

"Mapeandola" in front of my

I thought "maybe" ... only "maybe"

could have had a musical career

Ha, that music career!? Ha ha! dale!

I do not know "what musical career," that's my point

That's my point, you got a music career

If you had not become pregnant,

we had not married!

Look, I do not understand what you say

think you repent of having married me.

I do not regret anything! I am saying:

let's pretend instead of this wonderful thing

"So lovely" we have

we had other things to do

If we had not married, then, who knows?

could have had more time to meet,

maybe start a career ...

Yes, and then you never would have married me,

I see, yes, I understand what you say

Hey! been married 18 years!,

have an amazing son,

is in a great school ... I mean ...

no ... if everything ended today

probably would call a success, right?

Look, I did not want to ruin the lunch

but honestly ...

are unhappy.

Maybe it should have done is to be honest.

Could have made things worse

because I wanted to say:

"Hey, you two hate each other, divorciense!"

And so it should not go to those unhappy lunches
anymore.

Do not know why we do more often

was hilarious, once a week is little

Ah! I know!, you can believe what he said

about her marriage in front of us???

If you ever feel so

comes to beware that shit please

Seriously!. I liked your comment about the blowjob

Just in case you suck if you really want the

would not be happy, but would

Good to know, because as you know

my birthday is coming ...

Yeah ... mmm ... look what I've done ....

I forget ... you can tie

I thought of a nice pair of socks ...

Sox? 'If

You know, I jack off with those stockings ...

I think relationships should be easy

My first marriage was pure drama

was a nightmare.

And it was a relief to find someone so ...

So ... "free-of-drama"

Look, all these relationships

have so many unnecessary complications

as my first wife, who was ...

Mad-A Challenge

It's nice to find someone

with a balanced personality,

a rational human being, haha!

These relations are always

in which are one above the other

and we promised not let us

... Not drown in a glass of water ...

No ... it may be fanciful

But the thing is that maybe

this period of honeymoon ...

Last forever.

There you have.

Hey!, Dara?

Hi, I can help?

ehhhh ... if, wait

Love is for you, is Dara.

Do it go

I went

you want me to say?

you are? you went to work?

No, no. Tell him I'm sleeping. - Ok

Love, please do not give money

I will not give money, I promise

... Yes, give ...

I promise! I have no need to spend!

Dara I married at a time of ...

confusion.

I do not know, I looked dark and mysterious

Then I grew up and not

and then I realized that

was not dark or mysterious

only alcoholic.

Hey! Shakespeare!

Hey! this Katie?

I wanted to ask something ...

is, but this napping

Look, just in case

I have no money to give you, as you know

And Katie ...

I know you said he could not give a penny more

makes you think I look for silver

a knight can not go to say hello?

Look ... the unexpected visit of the ex-husband

a Sunday afternoon ... usually ...

is not the best idea

regardless I'm always glad to see you

then ... I can do for you?

Nothing, he was in the area

Actually, I have an audition for a play

Dara is a type not so bad ...

is just an actor.

Ok, I'm not being totally honest

there is a hearing

I'm in a financial downturn

so if you got a few dollars I'd appreciate it much

as live as "light"?

where are you going to stop these days?

A girl

this week

let me stay at home

You know what I can do for you?

I have a crap that was going to give

The you can sell on E-Bay

you can them out, 50 or 100 dollars

still works ...

Ok ... I'm taking

Chau Buzz

Always a pleasure

Buzz is that he tried to do the right thing

giving me the vacuum cleaner to sell

I do not know computers,

I do not have much luck

selling it on a website

but I will try to sell on the street

There the coast is clear

To be clear, do not you see him

that guy.

Oh, I was very young

his face was tortured artist.

How much did you give?

Why do you assume that you say something?

Because I know ...

The?

mmm .... you saw the old vacuum cleaner?

That? Why?

Can sell it on E-Bay!

You may be given some money for that

My God, you're so easy to convince!

It seemed hopeless!

Why are you so soft with my ex-husband?

Look, I feel bad for the guy, okay?

He had a chance with you and shit

I have it now

so I'm someone who feels empathy for the cause

When I married you inherited your family, yes?

Then I dealt with the Irish crazy

Your sassy sister, her husband lunatic

and I'm just trying to do

things right for them all, mmm?

Also, I think you would do the same in my situation, right?

In fact it is very good.

I do not look inviting your ex-wife psycho-

to tea

Think is true,
what they were talking at lunch

we are a successful couple

because we never see?

Yes, absolutely

I think it's important to keep

a safe distance, otherwise

you will fully satiate me

But, what if ...?

If we were to see each other again?

If you are pregnant, or something?

Are you pregnant?

No! No!

Are you sure?

Yes, I am

No, because I remember that night

a month ago, we drank too much ...

I'm not pregnant

was all hypothetical

If we need to spend more time together

desmoronaríamos us?

No, we desmoronaríamos ...

but I'm a little confused ...

We both agree on the children.

Yes!, I do not want children

It was purely hypothetical

All right.

It's all

I wanted to be sure we can take

Absolutely, yes. I say, yes

We can handle anything

that life throws us.

Do me a favor

As you spell Vasectomy?

Hello? 'Hi, I'm looking to Buzzy O'Rourke

Ok ... ahh ... is working, who is?

I'm his sister, Linda

Ah ... If your sister ... ok ....

mmm ... Hello

In fact his half-sister

we have the same piece of shit father

Listen, I can upload? very cold

and I'm not properly dressed.

Sure ... just went to work, but ...

Yes, I went.

Hi, My God! Hello, you must be Katie!

And you must be Linda!

My God, you're beautiful!

Thanks, thanks.

You're welcome.

Oh, sorry I wanted you to know that a lot

I missed the wedding

I really wish I could be

Come in, come

Oh, Wau!, Look here!

It's giant twine must be filled!

You have something to drink? a beer or something?

Yeah, sure, Thanks!

Recently I get off the plane

and travel is so stressful ... and all that ...

All that traffic in New York

It Heineken-Oh yeah, you have to be cool ...

That's one reason I wanted to go poque LA

Thank you.

You know, traffic is horrible

Yes, completely

Buzzy you warn him you were coming?

Because I do not say anything

Really?, I say, I called back about a month ago

and told him I thought to come

Ah.

What time back to work?

In a couple of hours, close to 19.

Ok!, I will take a shower, freshen up

There is a good place where I can accommodate?

if ... if ...

There is an extra room

Perfect, I leave you free

is that you have to go to work

and thank you very much for letting stay here

and I want you to know, do not worry ...

... Until I find my own place

Beautiful, totally gorgeous

He never spoke of having a sister,

or I who said they

I think the invite to the wedding but did not come

when he arrived and said he hoped to stay

I was a little surprised.

Hey! guess who I ring the bell this morning?

Your sister!

my brother ...?

Shit! Do not tell me really came

Yep! I left the department

my jewelry will be safe?

do not know if I can guarantee

Well, then better home andd

Look, I have another client

finished, go home and take care

You knew that was coming?

I called a couple of months and said

I was thinking about leaving Los Angeles

save for a plane ticket

but I never really going to show up

Well, it appeared!

and "the impression" that will stay with us

shit!

Heart, look, I will take care of this

I will accommodate in a hotel or ...

no, no, okay, it's your sister, I'm your woman

do the right thing

Cornered, thanks

See you at night

See

I know Linda is a pretty burned mine

our father died when he was 16

and ran away from home after that,

went to Los Angeles, then ...

16, a fugitive in Los Angeles ...

Not exactly a recipe for success.

Guess who?

ehhh .... I'm in town!

I wanted to call and say hello

and know how are you? ... how are you?

I need to see, I'm here in N.Y.

I thought we could be

I'm here! really!

Where were your honeymoon?

He was good?

Dale ... I just want to see

You still there?

Listen do not be an asshole

Let's meet for a drink, yes?

Yeah, ok ... hey!

Thank you.

You're kidding?

My God!

I can not believe it! 'Hello!

We are in N.Y. - Yes!

Here I am

Wau, I was rushing to get home

to greet you, where are you going?

Yes!, Right now I'll find me with a friend

we drink

but I'm glad that we are crossed!

I'm shocked

Look at you, you grew a lot

When was the last time you saw?

It was still a teenager

Actually it was Dad's funeral

Yeah, right.

Neither cried

You keep talking to your mother?, Or ...

No, I do not

and I have no plans to contact her

I can not blame you, either

That's the Katie bag?

Oh, yes, oh you know ...

I did not come prepared for this climate

on the other hand, is nuts-Si, if

I hope you do not mind, you think?

No, no, this also

You should know that

I forgot to mention that perhaps you were coming ...

Ah! ... So this morning was so rare

I mean, a little weird

Look, I have to go fast

I have to meet my friend

but I see you later, we find,

we can chat some more.

I'll be home all night

Excellent! 'See you then!

Welcome to N.Y. and see you tonight, ok?

Yes, totally, we later

Not to tell Buzzy if asked, but

I felt very close to him as a child

He was at home all the time,

and I'm glad I could come

and see for a while,

and re-meet him, I think ...

Linda ... I can say about it?

I can not say I really know her well

I was already in college

when she was a baby

and really I have no memories of her.

What surprised, really!

Because with my band ... we'll be
all weekend.

How many are in the band?

I and three kids

My wife owns the studio ...

and she goes out on weekends.

I can schedule you at this time

How old are you?

Well ... How old are you you? - 23

Really? 'If

Okay ... - If I was born in '87

'87? - JA-

And where were you in '87?

Actually .... it is a long history

I think I have the Oedipus complex

My God, you're giving me a heart attack

Excuse me ....

What? - What are you doing?

Do nothing

Why not ask her out

I mean, I'm sitting here, but again

why not ask her out?

Yes ... but .... no!

I can see you! through the glass, I can hear you!

P.T., you saw it?

Dress like trying to cogérsela or what?

Not out of this!

Marsha, we were checking the lines

and you're making a fuss about nothing

I do not understand ... 'I do not lie

I'm not lying!

We were just talking about it!

Ah! you're the composer and musician ...

and the owner of the studio!

Look, this should be my job, ok?

You're here for me

You do not know anything, you do not know anything!

You have this job because I gave it to you

No? ... Okay?

Because I have to sit down and look at you

trying to fuck a minita

while I'm here in the fourth

if you do, do it in private!

You're turning into a disgusting old

I am a musician, I have ideas, I have dreams

I can do something creative, but ...

not ...

By the way, thanks for making me wait 2 hours

I could not get a taxi

and I come from Queens

Ok! but I say ... 2 hours!

So you do in N.Y.?

I came for you

You came for me?

I think you came 10 months later

Yes, I see. Why not tell me you were gonna marry?

I told someone I had known

and that was serious, I told you

That is very different from saying "I do"

When you left L.A. I did not think

the next I saw you'd see that married

I would have to go

What is this? you hate me yet?

That's the point?

No, do not hate you

I do not want to have this conversation, Linda

He took the job after I told

I would not marry him

I guess I was not prepared

But ... now I think it was a mistake

It broke my heart once

Why do not you follow on with your life?

Because even I love you 'No, no

I do not want to hear that

Why, if it is true

Because I'm married reverendamente, ok?

That's not my fault!

could you not marry me

does not mean you could run away and marry another

No! no! is not it, that's not what happened!

that's not what happened

I want to ask something

What are you doing here?

I do not know

I do

Recontra still be crazy, right?

You say?

I can not

Really?

Yes

Yes, really

He is about to go home

and go to bed with his new wife

wanted me to see that maybe

I can go to bed with someone too,

if to

men respond to that.

I got to a guy jealous

and they will do almost anything you want, yes?

Cute!, Sooo cute.

You're kidding!

Hello dear!

Hello baby!

Hey!

It was a good night?

A very good night!

We covered 94

Wau Wau!

Let's stay here and take a glass of wine, shall we?

How was your night?

You met your sister?

Yes and no is to do with the subject

Yes, it's my sister

but I do not recognize ...

and best of all, this here
by a bed of shit

Glad to hear you say this

because I think it is a "little problem"

say, a little, a little bard

Just a little bit

Yes, I know

Is he here?

No, no, actually came

You have friends here?

I have no idea, but

appeared in N.Y. in the middle of winter

without a coat ...

let him take one of your closet ...

Okay ... good ...

If ... you know which grabbed?

No. .. I know ...

wrong?

No!

Enough then 'Welcome to N.Y.

Why come to N.Y. in the middle of winter

without a coat?

I do not understand.

totally, you're super generous

Thanks ...

No, no! of course.

You're the boss

I drink to that

And now I go for a swim

a bath?

Yes, and I'm taking this with me

Want some company ...?

No, this also

Ah, is there!

that sh ...!

what the hell goes here!

For!

Okay! is my friend!

Parala! Shut the fuck up!

Shut up!

Andate the whore of a mother

What the fuck is wrong with you! 're playing the father here?

What the heck is it, my God?

Get out of my house Andate to shit "friend"

Andáte to shit

Take this all

It's your problem!

Andate to shit!

Wait for me!

Do not know how Katie will react

obviously this upset

because Linda took shelter

and also lied to Katie

saying that I gave him shelter

Steal the warm, bring a chabón,

All within 12 hours of being here

this is not good ...

You should be grateful

not heard it again last night

Why? what happened?

I got up at 5 am

to find an unknown type

zarpados fully in the kitchen counter

That?

Yes, I know, is crazy

... Very funny.

Due to security

clean up the kitchen

Thank you.

But the point is not the kind of thing

you want to see by your sister

What did you do?

The kicks take the

and are taken

But she was re-in fart

and made shit

Not like no one woke up

I was screaming in the hall

Wau ... well, I can not make much fuss, I think

this is what kids do today

go to a bowling alley, know any kid

take them home and ...

Garchan ... the kitchen counter

So that's what they do today.

Absolutely, I read in a magazine

Are not really being of any help

That's my sister

and do not need that image in my mind-pad

No, I'm not angry

Why should she not feel at home?

Been here ... 12 hours ...

Never eat breakfast on the counter ...

then, all right

Now, seriously

maybe I become puritanical,

but I think bringing a strange,

the first night in a strange house

is a little ... promiscuous? I must say ...

Even as you could not sleep

in the midst of this madness last night

It was a bizarre appearance

you almost tear your head with a baseball bat

I guess you were protecting me!

I did not know who was!, Listen to noises

I figured that someone had entered the house

waiting

Speaking of Rome

Ah! There she is

Hello

Buzzy? ... Hey, so ...

these ... very angry about last night ....?

Yes!, If

I'm a little more than angry

Excuse me!, Look, I was half drunk

and we were closer to home than his

and I thought it would be more comfortable, or something ...

Then I can ...

I can go back? or ...?

Waiting

Want to know if its okay to stay with us

If-If welcome back!

Are you sure? - Aha

Hey! good news,

You're welcome back

I'm going to work in a while

but when I get home

We need to have a looong talk on

"Rules", if you stay with us

for a little while

Ok.

secure a long talk ...

When I go crazy, I only see red

I do not think I react

I inherited from my father, was very impulsive

and often exciting because things happen so

others, only shitty situations

Good day

No, I did not

was supposed to do with you

Why?

We can try to start again, shall we?

I know! but I made a mistake!

I was wrong

I did not think about your upcoming move to N.Y.

and you'd get married in 10 months

I thought maybe we would have another chance

I was wrong

Is that what you are playing?

I made a mistake and was wrong

Ok ... well

if you're 100 percent sure

that are ready to go

and say goodbye forever

then I'm leaving tomorrow

I go back to L.A.

and leave you in peace

but if so, call me, ok?

Hey! Buzzy are you?

No, no, it's me

Hey!

Yes, yes, shameful return, right?

It happens to all

Also, you have fun?

It was the best night, you know?

Oh, Buzzy told me you took one of my coats

Oh ... shit ... shit!

I should leave it somewhere

the "left somewhere"?

Do you remember where?
somewhere we can call?

No, not where it was

But maybe ... you can replace it?

was very expensive?

It was ... yes

Hey ... ok, fine

We are happy you are here

There are a couple of things you can do

that would be helpful

and the first would

not use as many towels when you shower

a lot because I hate washing

and the other thing is ...

if you can avoid bringing home strange guys

would be great

Buzzy told you?

Yes ... yes, yes, of course

Oh! ok

Well, first of all

so forgive me for towels

I thought they were there to be used

and then ...

You never had a night of pop?

Yes, yes ... of course it is.

I do not want strangers in my apartment

late at night, if that's okay

understood

I have to hit me a shower

and ... I'm not too dry

Sorry, there are some water here?

Perfect

They saw that, right?

was as hostile ...!

I opened the door in my face!

just trying to be nice

... And she did not like

Ok ...

It's official ... I do not like it

I know I was a guacha

I have this hangover from hell,

I get home

and the first thing I get is what the towels

Who the hell cares about towels?

They broke my heart last night!

To be clear,

I had uncontrolled nights before I got married

Hi, I need to talk

Hey! 'Hello

Hey, my love, by chance this Buzzy at home?

No, Max is training

Ok, I just wanted checkearlo

I do not believe a word these days Max

Heart, listen,

Buzzy I mention something about Max

cheating on ...

No! happening?

I would say if he knew?

Yeah, right! could not hide a secret

to me.

do not know, Katie is half naive

men know

they do not share that shit

Marsha! you are my sister!

I'm his wife!

Want a drink?

If water, please

When I graduated from college

I was married to Max, we met at school

and had a son shortly after

It is he who goes to school

For me, I am involved in the life of John

I mean, when a mother is

is very involved with the kids

Max and I think also

now I feel all the passion

to my son has to focus on other things

I am a little worried about you and Buzzy

Oh, Marsha not start, please!

how well you know her?

I say that this wedding rush

way too fast for my taste

I'm fine, thanks

Trust me, one never really knows

I mean, I'm with Max always

and still do not know

Why insist on doing this, Marsha?

It turns me off, but my husband

and I love it

Heart, I tell you something:

Why do not you said

that his sister would come and stay with pc?

Is not it strange?

No, is a hanging

called 3 months ago

saying that came

and did not call to confirm!

Do you remember what Dad said?

Better to ask forgiveness, ask for permission

I feel that these projecting

your relationship in mine

No! no! -Something happened to Max?

Today I am hypersensitive to dishonesty

I can smell the 1 km

Why be afraid to tell

her sister was coming to stay?

I do not know ... maybe, thought you were going to say no

or maybe he knew it was a pain in the ass

I do not know, the point is he knew and did not tell you

you have to start dwelling on these

little lies, that's what they do men lie

Yeah, I know, and maybe you're right

Maybe I said because it did not want you to know

the very slutty and it's busted

his sister

Last night, brought home a guy at 3 am

and it was trincando on my kitchen counter

and also I banque ... more or less

Until today when I try to talk

and became the canchera

As if asking something unreasonable

to ask strangers not to bring home

Look, the guests are always a problem

but, when a family member, as a

English whore old mother

or a sister trolita of Los Angeles

then it is a bad, bad idea

and that said Buzzy?

I did not tell even

not to say, not as telling

when your sister going to my fucking house?

I thought you said you could tell all

Yes, I can!, But this is different

is his sister, and was always sympathetic

with Dara and you ...

I?

Why is understanding me?

no ... you know ... the 'He' what '?

He thinks you do not like

Well ... not

At least it is smart to recognize

Why, did you?

I did nothing ... look at you to you yourself

're a desirable woman

're beautiful, successful

these wealthy

not, was in a hurry

to put a ring on your finger

A ring that paid you

I think Marsha believes that

I'm not good enough for her sister

We come from different worlds

No ... she never opened me

and it's funny, it grabs with Max

because it was he who introduced us.

she hates me!

I do not hate you!

although it may be that this no longer
"Madly in love"

I have to get away from this marriage

I told you not want to hear this bullshit

Ok? I do not want to go home

and having Katie wondering

about pc, and forced me to lie

Tell her the truth!

Seriously!, Finish with this

and it is for you!

Yo! I have to see me

When you said "18 years is a success"

It's true!

John is in school

does not need us closer together

Do me a favor, okay?

I upload this shit to me, yeah?

I was trying to soften

what was becoming

in a very uncomfortable conversation

Yes! but what you said was true!

Forget I said it!

I can not forget!

I ended

I'll ask Marsha divorce

No, you do not

No need to bother your wife

I do, somehow, responsible

for planting the seed in your head sick

that you are going to divorce!

This the girl in the study

I swear by God that is beautiful

I do not want to hear this boludez

I cogermela everywhere

Back to work, you're a fucking skeleton

The more I give to this

Hello

had hoped that you would know

Listen, sorry about last night

No, nothing happened with that guy

was trying to make you jealous

wanted to come running after me

and tell me I do not go

but you did not

No, I will not leave you alone

because I'm in love with you

and I want to be with you

No you can see me for one night

one night

I do not care ... where you want

We can go to a hotel, no matter

See you then

If, if, if ...

Hello

Hi, Dara

Who?

Dara Flynn, who are you?

I'm Linda's sister Buzzy

Who are you?

Sorry, I'm the ex-husband of Katie

I have this vacuum that had to restore

let me go?

Oh, apparently I have no permission

let men of the department

so, better bass and give it to me

Barbaro, thanks

Ok, give me 5 minutes

My nature is my nature

I see a beautiful woman

react, respond

I ask out ...

pass

it's almost like ... hello, good afternoon

Concerned?

felt in the stomach

it's almost like being hurt

lies with them

I need tenderness

she has the style Blanche Dubois

someone who relies on the kindness of strangers

figuratively speaking

I was excited and a little nervous

to meet Miles

and there was beer in the fridge

and thought it was okay to go for a couple of free drinks

Katie never understood the temperament of an artist

was never emotionally in tune

to really understand where it came from I

Yes, they are so organized

like to have everything in order and so

There is no room for spontaneity

Yes! Yes! I want to take me in your life

wild ride

The road of excess leads to the gates of wisdom

but do not drink ... and pass the gates of wisdom

For me as an artist, I feel ...

is true? is more honest?

I think it's important, you know?

what kind of artist are you?

I'm an actor, stage actor

Ever heard talk of Mizner?

No, it's a writer?

No, no ... Mizner was ...

as decribir at Mizner

It was a God, of the buildings

Give me a second, do a little exercise

Sacudite all, try to relax

Focus

Look into my eyes, ok?

Inspire

and allowed him to leave, exit

at any time

How to talk?

As talking, perfect

Wau, this is intense!

Wau, this is intense

He was flirting with her?

is hard to say

as an artist, what I felt was a kind of connection

was a spontaneous reaction

and her eyes seemed to be appropriate
for the moment

Oh, oh, there it is

Hey! I found Katie's ex-husband, Dara

Dara? where you found it?

Here. He came to leave the vacuum

But ... do not leave it up

Katie because I said I can not let

strangers in the department

Then you talk to Kate

And I was a little brash with me

Do me a favor, do not talk nonsense Katie

is being very generous leaving you be

Yes! there would be no problem between us

if you had not told you what happened last night

Of course he had to tell!

It is my wife, and this is your department!

Yes! but I came with all his judgments

and do not need your blame

Seriously, you can blame her?

with all your performance in the kitchen ...

Well! that's what I need not tell you!

Well good ...

which is supposed to mean?

Do not you remember how it all was when we were kids?

You brought a new girl every night

and dad harangued and complimented?

Yes, I was in college

and it was acceptable behavior,

you're an adult, staying in this department

Listen, I'm not angry!

and I'm not judging

She is going to break the balls

if this behavior continues

Look, I'm happy you're here

miss you, and it's great to see you

but please do me a favor

and just ... calm down a bit while you stay

Ok ... ok

I'll calm down a little

Oh ... I have to tell

I lost the shelter of Katie

Lost you grabbed your coat?

Yes, but I said it would pay

Trust me, you could not afford that coat

I got it ...

I appreciate that you said you find it

Told our story ...?

We met ... Max was training at the gym

listen to me ... my sister

this very good

said the other day who was horny

that you want this ...?

Why is your sister telling you walked

how hot was it?

No, he told Marsha, Marsha told me my

Where's the catch?

if she is so good, why is single?

Obviously I thought there was something wrong with you

you were mentally unstable or something

but luckily did not have anything bad

Bought on the first date!

We started dating

and soon it got serious,

I became infatuated, I proposed to her one night

they were returning from dinner

You say?

If

I said that if

and here we are

here we

She was pregnant

it was a big surprise

and I remember him at the show

we went in a tiny pub

and wrote that song

for me,

yes! did!

and proposed to me right there

opposite worldwide.

I remember being totally scared

with the "project" of parenting, and ... not ...

it all happened very fast

but still sweet

those were good times

If ...

She was upset ...

said, "we can go???"

Actually I said stronger

Forgive me, I can not by meeting and

If they insist on talking in this way at dinner

I mean, it's fine in the locker room,

there is acceptable

but it bothers me

Please Marsha! calm down!

You look like an old woman!

People talk about sex and whore at dinner

ok?, leave aside

No, I will not drop it

because I find it offensive,

on the other hand, you called me an "old"?

No, I said "looked like" an old

Please explain to me rather as "look" an old

So what say you ...

Is that everything and everyone bother you at all times

Everything?-Yes! I like walking on eggshells

terrified of what I can tell you you will fall ill

That's not true!

Katie, you feel like that with me?

No, not at all

See! Buzzy and clearly not

but speak in front of me like a gentleman

Knight? ... That'll never happen!

I think the only person you're terrified

You know Marsha? - What?

You lost the taste for life

The taste

The taste!, Yeah! The fun, joy, happiness

all gone!

Chota and complaining

So your personality became

I'm sick!

Nothing you say fun

Do not even remember the last time you laughed

When was the last time you laughed?

Seriously, when was it?

Want to know? - Yes!

Ok, when I saw you trying pathetically

get up to that girl in the study

I turned hilarious

You should have seen! being "charming"

I re-shit of laughter

Hey! why not leave it there, eh?

Buzzy! contales of those freaks you train at your gym

is very funny

Ok ... let me see ...

This this Chabon, Aaron, Wall Street

that embodies his maid ...

that's funny!

I want a divorce

Yes! ... No ... you know what? ...

Buzzy, you're right

were 18, and we consider it a success

I involucres ...

I say that? I do not remember having said

Is over, right here

Well, that sounds like music to my ears

If? well then!

but I stay with the department

Okay! I go to sleep to study

Great, "perfect"

Max, Max! e-e-e-wait! wait!

what happened?, go get it!

Ask anything!

I have ... to deal with my sister ... then ...

Great ...

Sorry ... I'm fine

pc is what awaits

Yes! I think 18 is a super-successful

My first marriage lasted 6 years

yours, how much? 4 years?

Get to 18???

I think they did a job from hell

Just out of curiosity

future as we see us?

I want more than 18,

I want forever

is that what you imagine, but ...-Yeah, me too!

When I said ... "I do"

Yes! I totally agree

but, 18, say, if we were to 18

'd both be very happy

Why am I back here?

mmm ... I think

to learn that he married

was ...

motivating factor, probably

It made me really want to see what

and go after it

And one for me ...

Ok

Health-Health

than another?

a more

Miss you

I want to put a song for you

I think you'll like

we

good!

you remember?

Dale, you want to dance

I know you want!

Come on!

Seguis love with my

So what?

it does not matter

Of course it matters

I brought you something

That?

You have to wait and see

not go anywhere, ok?

Ok I'm here-

Men are so predictable ...

if you use your sexuality in the right way

then you can get them to do

almost everything you want to do

Hey guys, did not think they would be still here

We're going to have a few drinks, if you want to come ...

What, now?

Yes!

Come with us!

If?

Yes! ... Uh ... 'Give,' Ok!

I can drink ... actually, you know?

I invite you!, who do you think?

My God! I can not believe what just happened!

Divorce! ... At dinner? ... How?

I will take another glass of wine, shall we?

Si-Si ... thought they were really happy

Really? 'If,' why you thought they were happy

Never saw them laughing

never say anything cornered

No, no! in the beginning,

years before knew

when they were still with Johnny

were like ... never saw a couple so in love

The way he looked

buy her flowers every day!

That when he was 18 years ago?

Why did you say your marriage was a success?

Look, I was trying to soften

"Other" uncomfortable dinner

God! known to have problems

but I thought they were any problems as

I had no idea

and you? you noticed?

No. .. no ...

not really

Not really ..??

Sometimes ...-What?

Sometimes in the gym, Max spoke she pests

I thought they were boludeces,

most bad-mouth their wives

You talk plagues me in the gym?

No, not pests of you

where this is going? I will not badmouth you

for at least 2 months ... or so

Cheers-health

You're a "prince" ...

she told me something ...

look ... I did not know

I was going to ask for a divorce at dinner!

We promised to tell all

and now, tell me to the worst

I know everything, have no fear

I agree ... in the future I'll tell you what you know

Because I was blind at the restaurant

was a holy shit ...

Understood ... understood loud and clear

Ok?

I think that relationships work

you have to be completely honest

count everything, even the smallest detail

I agree to some extent

there are certain "things"

that, frankly, is better

silent-If?

Like what?

Well, I do not want to hear about

my deepest, darkest thoughts

I can sometimes get to have

Yes, I want ... I'm telling you all

Bue ... say ... that was me!

sexual fantasy that you got a "temporary"

for example, 2 to 1, with two types of the pizzeria

I do not want to hear-I have no such fantasies

two types in the pizzeria, if you?

No! I have not the fantasy

the girl in the Starbucks not so bad ...

as I said! better beware those things!

Wow ... you look amazing

Why did not you say "yes" when I asked you

Ask me now

Ask me again, now

You know? were the only thing I really wanted

could we be so happy together

We can still be happy together

How could we? if I am already married

Divorciate!, Who gives a fuck?!

if you still love me

I can not

Why not?! if you were not even

married a couple of weeks?

people get divorced every day!

Fuck it, you do not understand

We're having a baby

why I married such a hurry

I'll have a baby ...

What? ...-In a few weeks

I will be father

I am angry with Linda

because he said he wanted to be with me now!

but it is too late.

I asked, I gave my heart

and she did not accept

I wanted to spend time with Linda

and I'm happy as things happened,

could not live with myself

know ... we're talking ...

Yes! three wet towels lying on the floor

Touch them 'Look, I used that towel

No! you always colgás towels

Do you mean? that she purposely shot the towels

on the bathroom floor, yes, yes, 'Why would I?

Because I asked him to cool him not to,

and clearly does not like being told what to do

I think you are putting a little paranoid

but, look, I'll wash the towels

My love is not for towels

but we could put a date to go?

And .. what is it supposed to say?

Ask about plans to stay!

and then to stay sugerile least

not so long

Thursday you fair?

Until Thursday I feel great, thanks

Now, I'm going to shower

I'm going to wash ...

My sister is swollen balls sometimes

Buzzy's sister is
completely on another level

It tests the patience of the saints

This kind of boludeces are those types

not bancan

Who cares if you lost a coat

or someone uses many towels

At chabones do not care "so much" stuff

except except encamarte

with an ex-girlfriend of another

that's probably the only thing that matters

Hello

Hello

Pass

as an actor, you know,

Live as if the extreme forces

come to a by themselves

Linda is a pure force

sheer force

You know what I need?

that accurate?

I need a drink

Sorry, but I have drinks at home

I have no alcohol at home

What is true

is that if you and I are here

and all the things you see

is all I need to have

I need no more

to "focus"

You know that is incredibly sexy

when you talk and

I wish we can do this but

we're like ... "family"

No, no! relatives are not

No! but you're the sister of my ex-wife

and this relationship ... Oh, oh -

I mainly hot ... your brother!

this, this is not a relationship

Now, take me to the bedroom,

or want to talk about it ... mmm?

We up-Ok!

No. .. no, no, do not go ..

is so sad!

which part?

Oh ... the whole fucking thing is sad!

You said 15???

I was ... with a silver in Hamburg but cost

If ... is your wife going to live up?

She will live up

I down here in the studio

You know ...?

15 is muchism time

I'll do something really nice for you

Come on!

Hagomoslo right here ...

Oh ... that good!

Are you okay?

If

you keep on crying

Not

want to talk about it?

Indeed, no

I can ask?

It was just a boy who knew ...

You have to tell me about it

Why?

To you that you care?

Yes, Linda cried the first time we had sex

but, and it is true, it usually happen the first time

whatever it is,

seems to have a strong impact on women

Baby, it seems she's not coming tonight

then why not ...

we do something?

If, 'I think it would be good for us

What is love, but I do not encourage this evening

Oh, I can put you in tune?

I can do it quickly!

Ha ha! sounds great

Maybe you can do when she leaves

after Thursday

Touche

I do not think that not having sex is a punishment

see it more as an incentive

to kick the crap out of my house to his sister

Guess what? Max was with the mine

last night in the study-what?

Yes - my God! These kidding

No, no, I hear 'Oh my God!

Yes! I can not be sure, but it was pretty obvious

My God! is very serious! - I know!

I can not stay in the department

if these droppings will be sent

I can stay with you?

Just for a little while

Yes, but Buzzy's sister is still with us

We have no free rooms, you can get you on the couch

The sofa?

You remember what I did for you

when you divorced?

When you came home and

contained you every night until you sleep?

You remember?, Yeah!

Makes this trolita on the couch

When would be good to start dating

I wait a few months

I know, but you were young and you could afford it

Would have to shave? Brazilian style?

I want to do is what I did in years

and want to do now ... tonight!

It might be good

I mean, in a way ...

There are possibilities waiting

that could be fun, exciting ...

and ... who knows,

I'm more mature now and I have more experience

That shit happens here!

Do not tell me two ... PC!

that this is happening!

Not what you think - not what you think?

who is this then?

Come with me, we need to talk

What the hell is it? -What?

What happens here? - We were walking

Walking??

There are 8 million people in this city

and you have to go with him??

Listen, I appreciate that you try
be my brother

I'm trying to do shit!

but these like crazy, we talked about yesterday!

I know, I know, but it happened, ok? things happen

I'm driving the ...

No, you're not driving a shit

What you do is lie

with my wife's ex

No, no, I'm sleeping with him

I slept "yesterday" with him, there is a difference

Obviously I can not talk to you, Hey asshole!

Entendelo, that ends today

Not going to see more

No, you do not understand you, I love it!

love her?! not even know her!

Fuck me that you talk

Your sister and I are cut from the same yardstick

from here, from the guts, Katie and you from here

head, think

streamlining all the time

I do not expect you to understand

You're aware that this asshole

in love with you?

That's what I just said 'No, not this!

No! not these! Listen

're a really sweet guy, but ...

Date around and andate to your house

You mind if I take my coat, please?

these fucking me?

Devolvele the damn coat

Chau! Come on, we need to talk

It is clear that you put me

in a wild storm of shit, yeah?

So this is what you have to do

you have to go and tell Katie

because I'm not going to

Why would anyone have to tell you something???

I must say, I do not want to tell

you put us in this situation

so you have to explain it to you

that's what we do

we tell all, honesty is called

Really? this idea sounds terrible!

You have to promise me when you return,

Now I have to go to the gym, you have to tell you!

if I tell you I will take!

You should have thought of before

Hey!, There you are

Linda, this is my sister Marsha

Marsha, this is Buzzy's sister, Linda

Nice to meet you

Nice to meet you at last

Listen to Katie, I would ...

I would like to talk to you

if that's okay

there is something I have to say

I have to tell you ... ...

eh ... sorry, we're in the middle

of a family crisis, right now

My husband left me 18 years ago

Oh no, sorry!

Yes, we need to talk about where they go to sleep

because I have to spend the couch

I can not stay in my house

the-course is still there!

Yes, because I want to say

is that today I'm going!

Are you going? -Yes! 'That's great!

Thanks Linda!

No, thank you, you were so generous

I do not want to take advantage of your hospitality

No, no, not really - I'm sure no ...

Well ... I'll pack my things

you can change the sheets?

I'm sure that must be changed

Si-Thanks

Thanks Linda!

Hi, I'm Max

yes, I do not have session, I wanted to talk

Thanks

That shit thought, pulling the pump

in the middle of dinner

was not the place for that pedorrada

I thought not, so I went

but the sync was amazing

when I returned to study,

Vanessa, that girl I told you about

was still working

The thing with Max is that it is a poor reflection

of my ability as a coach

not gain muscle mass, not weight lost

all it does is come to the gym

to pelotudear

All the time I say, do not need a trainer

need a psychiatrist

I do not want to hear these stories

okay? so here's the deal

I think I can not train more

This is putting me in an uncomfortable position

I went because I was excited

I thought I wanted to hear the news

This guy ... 18 years married, you know,

yesterday sucked me right

I wanted to tell, share the good news

and I get that I want to train more

No, I think he understood it all wrong

Hello! I am, I am glad you have not attended

Just wanted to call ...

I wish to say this last night

I just wanted to get out of there

but I wanted to tell you now

if he had known the situation ...

never have been,

never have come to N.Y.

I want you to know ... I'm very happy for you

I think you'll be a great dad

and I just wanted to call and say goodbye,

bye

I do not know, I think I have to go

I think I have to go back to L.A.

Marsha is a little time with us aquedar

What happened to the other plan?

that you were going to sleep upstairs and Max in the studio?

Esra well, but last night someone brought Max home

and I could hear them, and I can not ... you can believe it?

I dunno, I do not care ... uh ...

by the way, where is my sister?

Linda was gone!

We were in the kitchen, came and said he was going

that you mean by that is "going"?

He told where he was or where she was staying?

No! -Not

seemed happy

He said ... something else?

About what?

Today when I went to work

came out of coffee and I found it

and Dara ...

My ... were together?

I do not know, I think the quote that was last night

had to be with him

What!? This is another type of relationship?

and as you know this? My God!

He took the whoring to new level

But it is a cobarte, came and said he had to go

packed up and went to hell

because they wanted to tell me that caught my ex-husband

I'm sure ... he was afraid to tell you something

is a young lass, is vulnerable

vulnerable? ... vulnerable! ... then

vulnerable means you have to take

any of N.Y. life and shit!

I liked when I saw

her look was suspicious

You say that my sister is suspect

Fully suspicious!

He stole my coat, my bloody towels used

caught on the kitchen counter

and now what my ex-husband garchó

this is a holy shit, Buzzy, a shit

Look! I'm mad as like you!

I have no my sister is encame with Dara

what you feel is not questioned here, ok?

Now, your reaction is a bit disproportionate

where not going to stop tonight

And I was like the pelotuda knew nothing ...

... And if I had left the cafe and I found them?

You did this to me?, I hid all this?

From this you spoke, units are not known well

before marriage, so I was against it!

My God, Marsha, shut up!

Do not tell my sister to shut up!

My sister is a good person

Your sister is ... the devil!

You're being a little irrational ... ok?

why were not on speaking in the morning

and not have to deal with comments "extras"

I'm going to work, and tomorrow

you and I are going to have a conversation

because I think that maybe, want different things

in this connection

and I think those different things are important

Really? let's get to it?

I told the truth!

my fault what my sister?

Why the hell did you do that?

Why do not you tell about this?

My God ... seriously?

No chance that Max let him in to Hell

Christ!

Dress this girl?

First, he steals my coat

then used all the towels, 2 times

and then take my ex-husband

I say, my ex-husband!

I feel that if I had a bunny

I would be boiling in my kitchen!

Hello! how are you?

thanks for re shit against marriage

I'm super happy that you came to visit me!

do you want!?!-just wanted to talk to someone

Ah! and why did not you call your new friend Dara

and incidentally, spend the night

Sorry, I said I was not thinking straight

I would say you were not thinking at all

Why do not you tell Katie,
as you said you would?

I could not!

I was afraid, and was his dark sister

getting pick, and I thought it best to leave

Ok, now put me up the ass problems

so that, thanks muchísmas

I'm sorry! I'm a mess! I know!

I have no one else, you're my brother

I need your help

Yes! and I was trying to help

and all you did was shit more

Not to do! I have no money

and I just wanna go home!

I do not feel well ... want to go home

Where are you?

I'm in a hotel, I'm in

Cosmopolitan, close to home

Why do not we meet for breakfast?

There is a little bar in the corner, at 9 o'clock and ...

We see that, yes?

Ok, you'll be alright?

If

Well, see you in the morning

Ok, thanks

Hey Buzzy! you awake?

No, I'm asleep!

Hey! you know what I'll do tomorrow?

You know what? I could care less

because I'm sleeping ...

I'm taking one day at the beauty spa

I'll join hands, I will shave ...

I'm going to dye the roots, it will be great!

Guess what? I suck an egg!

and you know I'm going to do next?

You know Marsha? I think I said I was sleeping

I'm going to a bar and I'll take 200 daisies

and I will raise a type, an asshole

a nice asshole

I'll suck it suck it

and then I'm going to get in the kitchen

Yeah ... sounds wonderful, do me a favor?

make sure you use lining

Will not you have to marry again!

Ah! and guess what I do after that?

You know what? ... Hell I care what you do three!

I thought you might like!

're always counting

about your sexual exploits with my sister

I thought you were going to enjoy what I tell you, right?

Marsha ... Good night!

Good night!

it's 2 am and it is obvious

I will not be able to sleep

with Marsha trepanandome ears all night ...

I can not stay in bed thinking

how to fix things with Katie or

go to the restaurant to try to fix them

I can talk a minute?

I am very busy now, Buzzy

You can not give me a minute?

Look ... I understand I should have gone home

as soon as I saw them and tell you

I should not expect me to tell her,

I'm sorry, I fucked up, ok?

I'm scared, Buzzy, very scared

Of what?

I think maybe we rush into this relationship

You're crazy! we are a great couple

we have the perfect arrangement

and these ruined! 'You do not want a "fix"

I want a marriage

and joked all the time

about how things are so random

among us, no dramas,

we never

I think ... maybe we are being naive

that perhaps we are avoiding something

you see what we are avoiding?

We have a great, great

We are avoiding the real life!

I mean, true intimacy

I'm not talking only about sex

I think I was lying to myself

crao I need much more than this

What more do you need? I love you

I love you!, More need than that!?

So why can not you be honest with

I am honest with you! Ok?

sometimes little things do not tell

I forget to tell you things

those things add up

and I have fear that after 18 years

we are so full of hatred and resentment

Max and Marsha,

and now I look, and not who you are

It seems that your sister was talking,

you know me! Look at me, know me!

I do not know, I'm seeing strange attitudes this week

-If foreign attitudes

I was protecting my sister

can you understand that? she's my sister

If, if, instead of protecting me

your wife

and understand, I understand, you worry about your sister

Yes-but it was surprising to me

because you never hear mention

until this week, until he came to our door

and ... I feel I do not recognize you

and the person I married

I have to go back to work, this is crazy

You took everything out of proportion

I can not believe this happening so fast

Two days ago we were happy ...

and now ... she is cuetionando

if you know me or not

no ... I was speechless ...

Good day! -Good day

want some coffee? -Thanks - for nothing

as you sleep? -Not so good

I had a rare night

Buzzy came out, early morning

Yes, trains several clients, before going to the gym

I tell you something really funny?

Last night it was bothering

and said he would go to a bar

to get up a guy and there cogermelo

wanted to "give back" your stupid
"Sexual comments"

He hated it! ... It was so fun!

Marsha know what?, You stay will not work

What, where did all this?

You do not like Buzzy, and you do not like you the

and just get rid of his sister

and that problem, and not want any more dramas

in my house, I'm trying to do

my marriage work

That is, these from the side of it?

Yes, I am, because he is my husband

and we are trying to overcome things

and I have to give priority

Well, absolutely not!

You stayed with me when you needed a place

Now I need a place, then I am!

I stay

Ok!, I'm going to bed

Ok ... you know, I'm getting divorced!

I have also problems

I just get u $ s 2000 in cash to give

must return to L.A. and not even

what kind of life is there, then ...

better have money in your pocket when you return

Well, here there are 2000 dollars

do me a favor, do not tell Katie gave you the

I do not need both

Yes, you need to cover the plane ticket

and if you decide to return to N.Y

you go to buy a nice coat before he came, shall we?

I remember as a kid

came back home and your life was a mess

as you did to change, become a good guy

with a normal life

When I was in my 20,

also was a total disaster

I realized that if I kept acting like

would end only

And now I see, I see your behavior

and the same will happen to you

Because you hurt yourself;

and hurt people who care about you,

as I

We re last night shit things

a little bit, yeah!

but in a weird way

was a blessing

If? as?

forced me to reevaluate some things ...

I need to make some changes in my life

Yes, maybe I feel a little guilty

I am his older brother and I never had relationship with her

not saw in years

and I made no effort

to keep in touch

But now, I can do

is to try harder, and try

keep in touch periodically

and maybe go to L.A. to see

You still here ... where is Katie?

Go back to sleep

Obviously this very angry about something ...

Ah! entonses you go?

You know, I was your suitcase ready from day one

Coward!

Men are cowards ...

Max is a coward

Katie's first husband, Dara

was definitely a coward

and Buzzy ... could also be a coward

I think things can get more complicated

and it devastated quedría

What are you doing?

Oh, you're awake

I'm packing a suitcase

Why? what happens?

I think lingerie is

I stole my sister or everything?

Buzzy, para, you're doing?

I need to leave town

and I would love to come with me ...

the car is parked at the gate

I can not go anywhere, I have to work!

My first thought, after saying "I do"

I wish that my parents were alive

to see, were in my first marriage

did not,

Buzzy and I think they would have liked, much

My first thought, after we said:

"I do", well, she was pregnant

when we got married 4 months pregnant

I could not wait to get my dress

Neither do I

Yes, but not for the same reason

My heart broke! boom, boom, boom!

After saying "I do" was totally happy

I have an amazing girl, the beautiful

Linda is so different!

the opposite, completely

responsible ...

responsible and loving ...

My real first thought ...

was "just wanted a suck of dick more"

My life before meeting Katie

was always chaotic

My childhood, school, my twenties

until my first marriage

and ... after meeting Katie

a feeling of peace finally came into my life

I think the first thought I had

after saying "I do"

was probably ... a feeling of ...

tranquility or serenity?

Katie is a rock

and do you really need in my life

I think I finally feel

at peace

Then! ... Where are we going?

I have no idea, but I think

we need to go as far

of our relatives as we can

and then what?

and then talk

know and maybe work a little better

sounds good ... let's go
