the small stuff. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the star of the hit television series

The King of Queens, New York's own Kevin James.



>> Thank you, New York.

(audience cheering)

Oh, what's going on, people?

All right, great to be back here in New York, man.

Miss it, my hometown, love it here, love it.

The best thing about it is the pizza.

Gotta be the best in the world here in New York, yeah.

(audience cheering)

Yeah.

Hi, how's it tonight?

I had it tonight, you know what, suck though?

I had to share it with other people.

Way too much pressure when you're all

from the same pie, especially when the slices start getting lower and lower.

You gotta look around the room, do that pizza math or...


Alright, he already had two slices right there.

He should be out at this point right now.

What the hell is she doing? What is this?

Finish the cross, that doesn't count?

I hate when it comes down to two slices.

One slice is like, "YOUGE!"

And there's like little mutant sliver slice next to it.

Never really made it.

The guy went a little too quick with the wheel.

Hey!

And you beat her.

All right.

I never get the big slice either.

Someone's always like, "Hey, I'll take the big one."

"Okay, I'll get it for you."

I make it up in cheese, though.

Oh, the cheese fell off.

I don't know what happened.

Sorry about that. I was separating it from the other pieces and she slid off. I don't know how

Here and enjoy your skin flap that's for you

That piece that looks like my ass if it caught fire and someone put it out with an old t-shirt is yours

I don't like surprises and my pizza. I hate that they annoy me

I get my pizza home, I open the box.

There's a little plastic white ottoman in the middle.

[ Laughter ]

I'm gonna put my feet up while I eat.

[ Laughter ]

Slow down with the furniture. That's what I say.

Little things like that annoy me.

Like, I love the delis here in New York. Great delis here in the city, too.

Unbelievable delis. Yeah.

Yeah, you can watch where a deli -- [ Applause ]

Great. You know what's things? Every time I'm always online,

I'm always stuck behind the construction guy,

ordering for like the whole site.

Yeah, hey, don't.

Give me 48 coffees, 98 bagels, three bags of fone,

yons of box of ring dings, 96 slim gyms, ah!

(audience laughing)

Ah!

Let's go, let's go!

How big are muffins gonna get before we all join hands

across America?

They're huge.

If you walked in, yeah, I'll take a coffee and--

Oh my God!

Yeah, I'll have the bean bag chair with raisins.

Oh, you got it?

Oh, I got it.

I got it.

Woo, yeah!

All right, can't believe this is fat-free!

Woo!


All right, hey, you want to help me to the trunk of my car?

No, leave the saran wrap on it.

I'll cover my pool. This is good.

[ Laughter ]

See, that's a thing with muffins.

Muffins used to be like the size of a cupcake.

No more, right? Now it's either the very big muffin

or the mini muffin. What is with --

Yeah, they fill me right up, right?

It's like taking aspirin. All right.

I got a mini muffin. All right.

[ Laughter ]

Oh, look, good. He's a good.


Ah, no, no, I don't know how to go.

I don't know how to go.

He really got it. Yeah.

Hey, I think I got a blueberry in that one.

I got a blueberry.

Little things like that will annoy me.

They just tick me off, you know?

Like this bothered me, and it probably shouldn't have.

But I was out of Met Game.

I'm a Met fan.

I was watching-- [APPLAUSE]

Never, never.

Never. You-- I'm at the game.

It's not the boy I'm at the game.

And they sit me next to a guy and he's eating an apple.

(audience laughing)

First of all, does that not piss you off right there?

(audience laughing)

Guy eating an apple and it chased Eddie.

You shouldn't be allowed fruit in a ballpark, first of all.

It's like beer hot dogs, you know, peanuts,

and maybe the little ice cream in a helmet.

That's about it.

This guy's eating fruit, you know?

And you know what the problem was,

he was eating it way too long.

He was like way too into it.

(audience laughing)


He's like flipping it over, trying to find the good part.

Oh, look at that, I got a little--

It's like, dude, that $0.39 of bag, let it go.

Grab another one.

It's fruit, Frederick.

Jeez.

This is embarrassing.

I was in the hotel tonight, and there's coming down here.

And I got on the elevator, and there

were other people on the elevator.

But then the elevator stopped at my floor,

so I did that move to the front of the elevator.

But then the doors didn't open right away.


Come on, open up, open up.

This looks really bad.

I look really bad. You're like, "You just, "Oh God,

"ho, please, open up." You don't know what to do.

You're like, "I got to step back. I've made a commitment

"for already, step back now."

You look foolish.

I always get embarrassed on elevators.

First of all, I always expected to go right to my floor.

I don't know why. I'm always expecting the lobby

and I always get out too quick.

[ Laughter ]

Now I'm too embarrassed to go back.

You're like, "No, this is what I wanted.

I wanted to be here. This is where I wanted to be.

I wanted to be here.

I wanted to be here. No, I wanted to be here.

This is where I wanted to be.

Leave me alone, people.

And the people on, no, you screwed up.

Like, sure, you don't want to get back on.

No, I want the basement.

I need a towel bin.

I need a towel bin.

And I'm going to check the pipes.

Get away! Go! Go!

[ Cheers and applause ]

[ Cheers and applause ]

Comedy.

[ Laughter ]

This annoyed me.

You ever have someone start talking to you mid-sentence?

Someone you don't even know?

I'm online at the bank, the guy next to me.

Boy!

Thursday was cloudy!

[ Laughter ]

Who the hell are you?

I said, "Hey, Thammy, you know someone's gonna talk to you?

I don't like that.

You can tell when someone's gonna talk to you too."

They walk in the room, they don't say a word, you're like, "No.

That's definitely gonna talk to me.

I can tell he's gonna come to me any second.

He's a chatter.

I can tell these chatters.

You can tell the chatter people too.

They're very happy people.

They're excited to be wherever they are.

They usually know everybody's name.

Also, usually, Jinklin' change.

Oh, yeah, I'm a...

How the hell's it going there, if I can't get you?

Hey, don't have any, man. What's going on?

It's gonna say, uh, "That's something getting in the day."

Huh? The weather's...


Oh, crap. He's coming to me.

He is coming to me any second.


I tried to look busy, you know?

But I'm online at the bank.

I don't know how you look busy online at the bank, you know?

He's like, "Maybe if I look like I have to go to the bathroom,

he won't talk to me, you know?"



All right, it's working, but now I have to go to the bathroom.


I have a whole new set of problems now.


I don't enjoy the bank.

I hate going to the bank.

I'm always in a rush when I go to the bank.

I'm never prepared either.

I never have one of those checking deposit slips on me.

You have to fill it out there.

You start filling it out.

You see someone else walking the bank?

You have that little anxiety attack?

You know, you're like, "Oh, man."

(audience laughing)

No, no, no, no.

(audience laughing)

No, no, no.

No, drop the pen.

No, no, drop it.

No.

Drop the pen, lady!

(audience laughing)

No, I'm not gonna be laughing in line

'cause I'm having a problem spelling 13, okay?

(audience laughing)

I hate being the only one in the bank, too.

That sucks.

You still got to walk through the ropes.

(audience laughing)

How smart do you feel then, right?

Hey!

(audience laughing)

Yeah, hi.

Go around for, okay, all right.

I'm gonna make it deposit when I get to the front area.

That's what I'm talking about.

I'm talking to you in a minute.

I'll talk to you in a minute.

(audience laughing)

This is, all right, yeah.

They should have a guy handing out cups of water.

All right, thank you.

All right, good.

There better be a hunk of cheese at the end of this maze.

I'll tell you that later.


I didn't realize this either, but there's

a line on the floor at the end of the ropes

that you're not allowed to cross unless the bank teller nod

you over.

If you've ever walked right up to him, they freak out.

Right?

Hey, how you doing?

Let's start getting back.

Start getting back.

You can't come up here yet.

I am not ready.

So we're busy.

We will not you over when we are ready to go.

(audience laughing)

(audience laughing)

It's even worse at the airport.

We go to the airport, there's like a million ticket agents

lined up for like a quarter mile long.

I don't like being the next online there.

This way too much pressure there.

Everybody's pumped up, they're all going on vacation,

they're all looking at you.

Hey man, you're next.

Yeah, I know, next shut the hell up.

I know, you're all worried.

(audience laughing)

My luggage, you're all ready.

I know where it's going, right?

And the ticket agent people are very impatient, right?

Next, I'll take the next part, since are you?

Next, right over here.

So I'll take you right over here, sir.

No, no, no.

Sir, right over here.

OK, I don't freaking see you.

I don't know where you are.

I don't know where you are.

Everybody's pointing.

It's over there.

It's going there.

I don't even know.

Where do I go?

Where do I go?

Over there, it's on you.

That's all I had.

I didn't know.

I don't know.

I don't know where to go.

So I'm looking right at you.

OK?

That's not helping me.


(audience cheering)

Marco!

(audience laughing)

Then you're so pissed off by the time you get up there,

you don't wanna go on vacation anymore.

Sir, did you pack your own bags?

Nine in a rainy and guy named Phil

planned to bomb in my ass.

(audience laughing)

I love the questions at the airport because they make you feel real intelligent.

Sir, do you know what's in your luggage?



No.

I tied a sock around my eyes and I packed with my feet.

I'm thinking hot dogs and gunpowder, that's probably probably it.

I like when the ticket agent tells you their job too.

They give you like a play-by-play of what they're doing.

It's like you care, you don't need you, you don't know what they're talking about.

I was like late for a flight and I gave her my ticket.

I was like, "Here, can you take care of this, please?"

She's like, "Hah!"

Let me see what I can do.

Okay, your ticket is a code fair basis red.

[ Laughter ]

Now what I can try to do it, I can try to punch it in as a --

let me see if this works here.

Backspace, backspace, semi-colon, capital, [inaudible]

No, see it's not accepting it, okay?

Because your ticket is a T-151-6 as it stands right now.

[ Laughter ]

Now what we can try to make is a T615411, but we will receive whatever!

I gotta get to the big apple, Seth start moving along!

Susie with the wings and the hair and a bun and I'm a vest!

Punch it in and shut off!

I hate when you're online with like a lot of luggage.

That stinks and then the line only moves like four feet.

Right here.


Thanks, thanks.

No, I got it. I got it. I got it.

I think you're okay. We're good.

Okay.


Ooh, it's a lot of luggage for a little amount of space, isn't it?


Oh, we're moving again. We're going again.

We're going again. We're going again.


I'm sweating a little bit tonight.

When you're big, you don't need a reason to sweat.

You don't, right?

My friends cannot grab a hold of this concept.

Come up to me all the time.

Jase!

Tell you what you do.

You jump and rope in the attic?

All right.

Peeled an orange.

Got an hour ago.

Why, what's up?

What's up?

I love air conditioning. I had it growing up

I had an air conditioner growing up, but I had one of those dads who wouldn't use it all the time

Very selective about today dad, please

They break out that big oscillating fan for the whole family

Not a horrible invention that is like waiting for a bus, right?

Man, when does that cold air gonna get here?


But that was refreshing, right?

That felt good.


That wasn't right.

Listen, no, I mean, I was on the phone with somebody today

trying to get a phone number from that person

and write it down, but they didn't have phone number rhythm

and that pissed me off.

I'm talking about phone number rhythm, especially if there's like an area code involved like two one two

BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM

That is the rhythm I think we're all familiar with

This guy had no clue. I was like, okay, hand give me the number. He's like, "I had two one two nine

15, 8, 11, 6, 4, 2, 5, 7, 2.

Did you throw in your zip code?

'Cause I got a lot of extra numbers over here.

I have extra.

I can almost start a new number.

What do you got?

Start again from the top.

(audience cheering)

They really screw you up on the last four numbers.

That's where they get you.

5, 5, 5, 6,

Team 41.

Dude, I already wrote the sex.

I made the dash too close. I can't shimmy the one in my mouth.

Forget you.

You know what else it noise me?

People even slow ass boring messages on my machine.

Unbelievable. Yeah, you come home late at night.

You got to go to the bathroom. You're like, "Oh, look at this. I got a message."

Oh, this could be important. I better check it out now.



Kevin has it going, man.

It's Tim Duffy from "Work." What's going on, man?

And...


Anyways, give me a call back if you get a chance.

I will be, uh...

Well, you know what, if you call at 9/15,

I should be back.

Actually, anything I have to 9/18, I'll be home.

Give me a call.

I'm at...


...to buy.

(audience laughing)

This is great.

Now I gotta play the whole Tim Duffy message again.

(audience laughing)

From the top to try to get the number at 100 miles an hour.

That's fun when you're hunched over your machine

with like an index card and a little pet--

(audience laughing)


I got nothing on that pass.

I got absolutely nothing.

I got nothing.

(audience laughing)

Three thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts,

five thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts.

I got a six, four blanks of four and then I'm out.

I'm out again.

I don't know what to do.


I got a freaking G.

I got a J. Timmy gave me a J.

(audience laughing)

So many things like that annoy me.

This annoyed me too, 'cause little things

will make me happy as well.

You know, like I was going through,

I think it was like a taco bell, it was late at night.

And I'm going through the drive-throw

and the guy was like, okay, 7, 12, pull around.

And I got excited 'cause I had exact change.

So I'm like, that'll make me happy.

But then I went to hand it to him,

and I dropped a dime between the seats.

I was like, "Mother!"

Now I gotta do this move for 20 minutes.

Oh, my God, come on.

Oh, come on, man.

Oh, come on.

Oh, I can see the freaking ridges, I can see 'em.

So you're gonna have to pull up.

I'm gonna have to tell you to shut up, Anthony.

(audience laughing)

(upbeat music)

(audience cheering)

That's good.

This is all signs, it's all signs to me.

I gotta get in shape, I gotta do that.

I do, I either gotta get in shape

or hope ponchos come back in style.

(audience laughing)

I don't like weight loss advice

'cause you get weight loss advice from like everybody.

Everybody thinks they got the secret.

People come in up to me all the time.

You know what you got to do?

You got a chushu-girless gum.

That's your problem right there.

Yeah, 'cause my ass got fat from bazooka.

That's where I veered right there.

(audience laughing)

You ever get weight loss advice from someone bigger than you?

(audience laughing)

You know what you got to do?

Yeah, not listen to your fat or ass for starters.

(audience laughing)

And then it comes down to my fitness goals

are different than most people.

That's it.

That's what I've assessed.

Seriously, that's it.

Because most people want to lose enough weight

so that they look good in the bathing suit

or they want to lower their cholesterol.

I just want to lose enough so that my stomach doesn't jiggle

when I brush my teeth.

(audience laughing)

That's it.

Then it's just maintenance from there on out.

(audience laughing)

Look, you notice I have an emotional attachment to food.

I get excited when my food's like coming at a restaurant.

Do you get a little pumped up?

I could be talking to someone and then you see it coming out of the corner of your eye.

I have like a little party in my head.

I'm a...

Fresh, you're not sure.

You got to make sure you recognize an item that you ordered.

Oh, yeah, the onion fritters. Okay.

And you got to act like you're in the conversation.

Really, you lost your job. That's horrible.

Oh, oh.

Yes.

Then when it finally does arrive, you just act surprised.

Whoa, foods here. I didn't even know.

That's great. All right. Well, I guess we should eat now.

I just love fast food. I can't get enough of it. You know, I love McDonald's.

I can't eat it, but the problem is I'm in my 30s now. I can't eat it like I used to.

You know, I was in high school. I could eat like three big Macs, finish out the day like a hummingbird.

I had one big Mac the other day. I felt like a grizzly bear that got shot in the ass like a senator of darkness.








Sir, you can't wait out. It's a McDonald's.




(audience applauding)

Can't be in good shape when you wanna take a nap,

halfway through your big mag, right?

(audience laughing)

So they tell me to keep active, that's it.

Keep active, go out, keep active, do what you gotta do,

but keep moving.

So I'm trying different stuff.

Went down to Florida for a little bit, did some water skiing.

I'm gonna be try water skiing, I tried water skiing

for the first time in my life.

Anybody do it?

(audience applauding)

You like it?

Yeah, I didn't like it.

A lot of work's like, nah, that much fun actually.

(audience laughing)

I didn't know how much work was involved.

You gotta put the big vest on,

you gotta get in the water, put your skis on,

put your gloves on, grab that handle,

straighten out that rope, brace yourself.

You're like, okay, I'm ready, go!

Boom, I'm down.

(audience laughing)

They gotta pull the boat around,

they gotta locate my bathing suits, yeah.

(audience laughing)

I got it, I got it.

I got it.

She was on the inside, I got her.

I got her, stop looking, I got it.

I wasn't the brightest either,

because I was like the only guy going for the first time.

Everybody else they all knew what they were doing.

That's kind of discouraging when you can actually hear them on the boat.

[ Laughter ]

[ Sighs ]

[ Laughter ]

This sucks. He's down again.

[ Laughter ]

I didn't invite him. You invited him.

[ Laughter ]

And they turn around. They try to help you out.

[ Sighs ]

Try -- Look, try and stand up!

[ Laughter ]

Oh, is that the idea?

[ Laughter ]

I thought I was supposed to be dragged through the water

with my mouth open!

Stand up!


Stand up, up!




Thank you, sir.




That's the worst part about it,

because after you wipe out,

you're just floating there in that water,

waiting for your friends to circle around and pick you up.

You ever been way out there just?

I don't like this at all.

No.

(audience laughing)

This is embarrassing too.

I found out I scream exactly the same

if a great white is like gonna attack me.

Or if a piece of sea we touches my foot.

(audience laughing)

(audience laughing)

There's a moment I want back right there.

Get me in the boat!

(audience laughing)

It's a matter of Yucky Toes!

(audience laughing)

I'm touching it.

(audience laughing)

(upbeat music)

Just be honest with people.

If you don't know what you're doing like in a sport

or you're just starting, be honest.

You know, hey, I've never worn a skin before and I suck.

Should I go?

No, no, you shouldn't.

All right, thanks for the honesty.

Appreciate it.

Like, I went on vacation once.

I met up with a bunch of people and they were like, hey,

you want to go jet skiing tomorrow.

And I never been jet skiing in my life.

And I should have said that.

But I was like, yeah, I'll go.

I'm good.

They're like, all right, great.

Meet us here tomorrow.

So I meet in there the next day.

They all had their own jet skis.

They're like, where's your jet skate?

Oh, I forgot, I forgot it. I forgot mine.

Now I got a rent one, which is even worse,

'cause you get a piece of garbage when you rent.

And they're all bragging about theirs, right?

Yeah, it's a Kawasaki KZ-9000-Wave Humper.

Got the Humper, huh? Cool. Yeah, I got a...

I got a gray one. I'll be on the gray one.

It says rental with the big number eight on the back.

I'll be riding the bowling shoe out there. I'll be on the shoe.

They'll take off the like, "Eh, yeah! They're like gunning! I'm like, "All right!"





She's packed!


You know, I'm embarrassing it is to wipe out going zero?


No.


(audience laughs)

It's a trick, I'm doing a trick, this is cool.

(audience laughs)

Once my underwear got wet too,

that was it, the day was over for me.

They all had professional jet ski bathing suits on.

I didn't have that, I had an old pair of cutoff jeans

like cheap underwear I bought myself.

I have no idea what I'm doing.

I buy underwear.

Hey, look at this.

$38 pairs for a dollar.


Then I take two steps out of my house.

I feel like I have a tangled hammock between my legs.


Oh, wow.

Now I know why so many for so little.

It's pretty obvious now.

This is not good times.


This is rough.

I have an underwear situation here.

Hate that when you get an underwear thing.

Worst than having your own underwear situation is watching someone

else deal with their underwear situation.

You ever see a guy trying to pick the underwear out of his ass?

Without using his hands like he's fooling anybody?

Hey, how do you-- I think it's over here in Macy's.

I'm not sure we'll take a look though.

Yeah.


(audience cheering)

Dude, what the hell was that?

(audience laughing)

Would you turn into Elvis for a second?

What the heck?

What is this move?

You're not fooling anybody with your one cheek slide

or how to?

(audience laughing)

What's up, man?

Everybody walks like this.

Yeah, hey.

Hey Rob.

How's it going man? Good to see you. Good.

Alright, skipping her. Skipping up to the side.

So hard. Relationships are tough. It's tough to work it out with two.

Because we're two different animals. We really are. It's difficult.

You know, and I just feel like sometimes I can't do anything right.

You don't know how to move. You don't know how to work things.

So I just try to survive. That's all I try to do in a relationship.

Here's a little trick that I learned.

Recalling a little something that's very unimportant at the moment.

At a later date, we'll do wonders.

Remember one little thing, it'll freak her out. I swear.

Like I had dinner with her at her sister's house,

and I remembered one little thing, and I waited because it was going to come up sometime

and she brought it up. She was like, "You know the other day, remember last week

when we were having dinner at my sister's house?"

Oh yeah, yeah, when you had the little butterfly clip in your head with the sparkles on it.

You remember.

(audience laughing)

The hearts are a member.

(audience laughing)

I always remember lovely little nuggets about you.

(audience laughing)

You know, my girlfriend's a little off though.

I don't know.

Yeah, she's a little bit off and I'm thinking,

"Hey, look, hey, I'm, believe me,

"I am not the smartest guy in the world

"and I don't claim to be by far,

"but this was a little weird.

"I was on the phone with her and I traveled,

"you know, I'm here in New York now

"and she was in LA, you know, at the time,

And that's where she lives.

And I was on the phone with her and she was like, "God, I miss you."

And I was like, "Yeah, I know I miss you too."

She's like, "I wish I could be there with you."

And I was like, "Yeah, I believe I wish she could be there with me too."

Then it got like silent for like a beat.

And I got like worried.

I was like, "Oh, she's thinking about them here."



If I only had a magic carpet.




I'd be there in like two hours.

What?

Did you just say magic carpet?

We're agreeing that she's a magic carpet.

How do you get to, what are you going to lay over in Dallas?

What the...

How do you get two hours with a magic carpet?

Where's this?

Well, I don't want to go too fast.

I don't want to fall off.

Alrighty then.

Can't go to the movies with her.

Can't enjoy the movies anymore.

Because she sees every movie that comes out right away

with her friends first.

And if she likes that particular movie,

she wants to see it again with me.

Yeah, she wants to see it.

Yeah, this is great for every five seconds now.

Hey, hey, oh god, watch this part.

Watch this part.

What the hell was I doing?

Hey.


Hey, look at that.

I can make a dog.

I got a dog.

I got a dog going.

I'm sitting in a chair facing a tremendous screen.

Hey, watch this part.

Okay

She got mad at me she gave me an elbow she I mean really watch

I love the movie food

Popcorn is the food you should have in the movie that's the classic movie food popcorn

But I only like it in the movies. I don't like it anywhere else. I don't like when they stick it like sports bars

You know and they stick it in front of you and then like dance clubs do then you munch on an eff like 20 minutes

You see something you like hey? How you doing? Yeah, it's just a hanging out over here my buddies and stuff


pretty luck, right? When you own those shells,

spot welded way on the back of your tongue.

(audience laughing)

Then we finish up at the movie, I get back in my car,

I go to unlock her door and she lifts the handle

at the exact same time.

I try to unlock the door and they offset each other.

You've been stuck in that little tug of war

for about an hour.

(audience laughing)

Can't give me a second.

(audience laughing)

(singing in foreign language)

(audience cheering)

SIGUR-HASS on the curb, I will come around and leach in!

(audience laughing)

What the hell goes through her mind?

I have no idea. Can I get in there?

I don't know how about now, no, now,

â™ª I'm not in time â™ª

â™ª I can't get in harder â™ª

(audience laughs)

(upbeat music)

This is good, this is fun.

(audience laughs)

This is good, this is fun.

(audience laughs)

This is good, this is fun.

(audience laughs)

This is good. This is fun.

I got a card from my girlfriend.

For an anniversary.

We've been dating eight months though. It's a little weird.

She's starting to spring anniversaries on me.

You know, you're walking the door, you have no clue. Do you know what today is?

Oh.

I'm gonna say Sunday, but I'm wrong, right?

(audience laughing)

Two weeks ago today was the first time

you kissed me at a jiffy loop.

(audience laughing)

I forgot to check my sticker.

I apologize.

(audience laughing)

I don't love cards.

I don't think I speak for most, every man.

(audience laughing)

Right?

Did you know that it's really long romantic card, you like,

(audience laughing)

This is like homework.

This is...

(audience laughing)

It's tough, too, 'cause we won't finish him.

I'm gonna be honest, we don't finish the cards we get.

We don't read them.

We don't read them.

I'll be honest.

And it's hard 'cause when a woman hand you a card,

they stay right there.

They lock on you, right?

They get in like a horse stance.

Like, "Oh, I wanna see if it hits you emotionally,

"like it hit me."

(audience laughing)

Men don't give cards.

We don't give cards.

There you go.

Guy gives a card, it's like he's delivering mail.

All right, here I got your card.

Whatever, I don't care.

But we don't read 'em, we don't finish 'em, we don't.

We all do the same thing, we open 'em in front of ya.

Right, we put on the fake smile.

Hey.


And we give that little head bob to let you know we're finished.

All right, yeah.


You think we're reading it, we're actually going one Mississippi, two Mississippi.

Oh, no, no.

Yeah.

I'm never going to throw out a card either,

because if it was up to us, we'd throw it out pretty much

immediately, right?

All right, thank you.


What are you doing?

Is it going to hang it up?

I want to hang it up for you.

I'm going to take a check it out.

A little bit. I like checking it out.

Women love cards though.

They love it.

My girlfriend love it.

Yeah, god.

You haven't given your wife a girlfriend a card out of the blue,

They just freak out. They do. Hey honey, here I picked up some milk and oh yeah, I got you a card

Apparently not not I didn't

(audience laughing)

This means you were thinking of me.

(audience laughing)

How long go we are planning this like a month?

(audience laughing)

Yes.

(audience laughing)

Which is another lie, right guys?

Bike cars, there's five minutes before we give them to you.

We fill them out at a stop sign, right?

Yeah, I love you, I love you.

(audience laughing)

Couple exos on the bottom, underline a couple words, right?

Then we throw out the little brown bag

in the receipt 'cause that's evidence.

you don't want to get in court with that.

I've been in the car.

You get back in there with your girlfriend.

Five minutes later unexpectedly,

you didn't expect her to be there.

And she finds it.

You idiot, you bought this car 21 minutes ago.

And you got a butter finger.

First, you fat ass.


Look at this car about the car.

They don't represent real life.

That's the problem.

These cars get a ridiculous.

the big sunset with the two deer drinking out of the pond, creating the ripples of water.

That's not our life.

It should say, "I'm five-year-old fat."

See in the kitchen in ten minutes.


The cards are important to them, though, because more importantly than just getting a card

is getting the right card.

It's got to be like a mood thing and everything.

It's got to be the right card for the right moment.

They really put their time and effort into getting cards.

You ever been stuck behind a woman at Hallmark?

When they're shopping for a card, it's like a chess move to their right.
