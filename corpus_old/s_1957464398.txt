-Ladies and gentleman.
-[cheering]

You can feel excitement in the air.

Here we go, Houston, Texas!


Let's get this show on the road.

Dwayne Johnson here,
also known as The Rock,

also known as <i>La Roca</i> in Spanish,

also known
as the sexiest motherfucker alive.

It's not important right now,
but what is important

that you guys
have come together to see one man.

The man who hails
from a place that many of you know.

-The Alief area.
-[cheering]

Yes. [chuckles]

"The SWAT" as we call it.

Many amazing people
have come out of the Swat.

-Lizzo, BeyoncÃ©, Travis Scott.
-[cheering]

And one other person, who you guys
did not know has come out of the Swat,

is the one
and only people's champ, The Rock!


Well, just for tonight,
I've come out of the Swat.

But tomorrow I'll be from some place else.

Probably Hawaii. Listen,

what is important
right now, [chuckles] is that

I have the honor of introducing
the man who you have come to see.

Ladies and gentlemen of Houston,
a warm hometown Houston welcome

-for the man himself.
-[whistling]

The other people's champion.

My boy. Your boy. Mo Amer.

-[cheering]
-[deep base music drops]

[cool slow-beats music playing]

[cheering and whistling]

What's up, Houston?

All right, all right,
all right, all right.

Take a seat. Take a seat. Take a seat.

-We made it! We made it.
-[music fades out]

We made it, y'all.

For real, like, it's so amazing.

We're all here together.
I mean, after the last 19 months

that we've had.
I mean, we're here. We're together.

As a live performer

-I thought it was over, to be honest.
-[laughing]

And now we're here.
That was the second time

I ever thought my career
potentially might be over.

The first timeâ€¦


was right after 9/11.

[laughing and applause]

Someone named Mohammed. I was like,
"It's not looking good for me out here."

-[laughing]
-[Mo chuckles]

Matter of fact,
my own family turned on me.


My own brother looked me dead in my eyes
and goes, "Your career is over."


I was like, "How could you
say some shit like that to me?"

"You know I always
wanted to be a stand up comedian."

He goes, "Look how
they're talking about us on the news."

"Nobody wants to
see a Mohammed on stage telling jokes."

"Your career is over."

I said, "Omar, you're a pilot."

[laughing and applause]

Now I'm in a movie with The Rock.

In your face, bitch.
You know what I mean? [chuckles]

[cheering and applause]

Wow.

Is it over though? [sighs]

Is the pandemic over? [sighs]

Was it real? [sighs]

But what, is it over?

No for real, I'm asking.
Is it though? [soft grunt]

I'm always like laughing
and about to cry at any moment inside.

I'm like [chuckles and grunts].

Was is real? Is it?

You know what's real? Divorce is real.

-Divorceâ€¦
-[laughing]

Divorce is real as fuck.

Divorce is so real.

I got divorced in the pandemic.

It happened, you know.
What are you gonna do?

-[whistling]
-We both-- one guy's happy.

[soft cheering and applause]

It's not like those stories that you hear
where a comedian's like,

"Fuck that bitch." No.

It just didn't work out.
You know what I mean?

And it's fine.

And when you're married for so long
you're just use to certain things.

I was dead asleep one night.

-And then I farted so hard.
-[laughing]

I farted so hard I woke up ashamed.
Likeâ€¦ [gasps]

-Like this.
-[laughing]

And I looked over
to my left and I apologized.

-And there was nobody there! [laughs]
-[laughing]

I just turned over and cried. I was likeâ€¦

-[sobs]
-[laughing]

I wrote that shit down immediately.
I'm like, "This is hilarious." [sobs]

[sobs then laughs]


Is it real? Was it?

Is it real?

I don't know.

-Fuck.
-[laughing]

It's how I feelâ€¦ [grunts]

â€¦all the time.

Pandemi-- you know,

what the media did to us was,

honestly, it feels unforgivable.

It really did. It's like,

"Panic!" [screams]

"It's coming!" "What's coming?"
"I don't know. It's coming."

-[laughing]
-[shouts]

"Three people have it." "What? Huh?"

"It's coming!" "What's coming?"

"Something that has to do with a bat."

"I don't know." "Bats are coming?" "No!"

-"It came from a bat."
-[laughing]

"And it's this thing
you can't see with your naked eye,

but it's coming."

"You're all gonna die."


"Don't--" "What do you mean?"
"Huh?" "I'm scared."

"I'm worried." [chuckles]
"Don't worry, just get Chlorox."

-"You're gonna be fine."
-[laughing]

"Get as much Chlorox."

[soft applause]

-"But don't use the Chloroxâ€¦
-[laughing]

â€¦before you use Chlorox on the Chlorox."

-"Then you could use the Chlorox, okay."
-[laughing]

"When you get packages,

fucking bathe with the packages."


They had us all a bunch of assholes.
We're likeâ€¦

-[spraying noise]
-[laughing]

"Amazon came in."

-[spraying noise]
-[laughing]

"It's fine, fan it out. It's fine."

[soft cheers and applause]



"Put on a mask." "How many masks?"

It kept changing.


"Put on a mask. One mask.", Fauci said.

"One mask is like 33% protection."

"Two masks are like

-66% protection."
-[laughing]

"Three masks are like 97% protection."

-And then a plastic bag, just 100%.
-[laughing]

Just kill yourself.
Justâ€¦ [grunts] asphyxiate.

"Oh, no, we lost another one to COVID!"


"Nah, bro,

one more bag, bro. He killed himself."



"Stay home. We figured it out."

"Stay home." "How long?"

"I don't know." [laughs]

-"Monthses, I think."
-[laughing]

"How many monthses?"

-"Just monthses, bro, I don't know."
-[laughing]

"It's gonna be monthses."

-"How many monthses?" "We don't know."
-[laughing]

"You're supposed to know." "I know."

"But we don't know."

"It's monthses. Just stay home." "Well,

I have to go to work."

"Fuck your job," they said.


"Fuck your job."

"What do you mean, fuck my job?"

"I don't have to pay rent?"

-"Whoa, hold on, take it easy."
-[laughing]

"Capitalism. Take it easy."

"You still have to pay your rent."

"Oh, so, hold on,
but then I have to go to--

well, then, send me money.

You know what just send me money."

"No, whoa, what are you,
a crackhead, bro?"


"We can't send you money if-- if--"

"What are you talking about? We can't

send you--"
"Why you stuttering a lot, bro?"

"Just send me this money."
"We-- we don't have any money, okay."

[soft laughing]

"We don't have any--"
"What are you talking about?"

"We send you money,
but that's how this works, okay."

"We send you money and you allocate it

for different buckets.
Right. You got Social security,

you got Medicare, Medicaid,
there's a lot of buckets."

"And I'm sure you have a rainy day fund."

"Bro, you gotta have a rainy day fund."

"And it's pouring outside."

-"Fucking full blown hurricane season."
-[laughing]

"Seven hurricanes
hitting at the same time."

"Send me some fucking money."

-"I have a confession, we're broke. Okay."
-[laughing]

"What do you mean you're broke?
You're the federal government."


I know, we're in debt, okay." [chuckles]

-"We're in debt, all right, it's--"
-[laughing]

"It's a lot of-- it's debt, okay."

"How much debt?"
"We're just minus okay. We're justâ€¦"


"We're just--"
"I know what debt means, bro, just

how much minus?" "It's a lot of minuses."


"So much minus. A lot of minus."

"Just spit it out. How much is it?"

"Twenty trillion dollars."


"Twenty trillion dollars?"

"Who's balancing this cheque book?"


"MC Hammer? Who's managing
this whole situation?"

"How did you get
20 trillion dollars minus?"

-"Killing Brown people is so expensive."
-[audience cries out in surprise]

"Oh!"

"It's so expensive."

[loud sigh] "Just so much. So

as you can see, we can't send you money."

"If we're in minus.
Overdraft fees are piling up. We can'tâ€¦


send you out of minus." [laughs]

"What, Kyle?"

"The stock market is gonna fail?"

"Holy shit, Kyle. Heat up the printer."

-"Heat up the fucking printer."
-[laughing]

"Make three trillion dollars appear."

"And let's funnel it into the
Ponzi scheme that is the stock market."

[soft laughing]

Because the stock market
is a direct reflection

of American hearts everywhere.

If the arrow's going down that means

hearts and souls of Americans
everywhere is also going down.

"But look it's working, it's going up!"

"Americans are happy again."

-"It's going up."
-[laughing]

"It's sky rocketing!"

"Wait, wait, wait.
How the fuck is it sky rocketing?"

"We're all at home. I thoughtâ€¦"


-Iâ€¦
-[laughing and applause]

"How is itâ€¦"

[soft laughing and applause]

"Howâ€¦"

"How is this thing going up?"

"I thought it was all
based off of revenue streams

and quarterly earnings.

And nobody's working."

"I get Amazon. Shit." [laughs]

"Everybody is at home ordering,
this should be sky rocketing."

"Well, fuck you, Jeff Bezos,

and thank you,
Jeff Bezos, all at the same time.

"Like, but how
is this still going up, bro?"

"I thought this was all based off
of money coming in. Everybody's at home."

-"Look man, shut the fuck up, okay!"
-[laughing]

"Just look at the arrow.
God, can't you just shut shut your mouth

and just be happy
that the arrow's going up?"

"No, I can't, bro. We need money."

"Look here's $1,200. Hush money."

"Shut the fuck up."

[laughing and applause]

"Thank you. That'll last me a week.
I appreciate that." [laughs]

"Stop trying to distract me."

"How the fuck
is this arrow going up, though, for real?"

"Homelessness is at an all-time high."

"Look, aliens are real.
Chew on that for a little bit."

"What?"


"You talk to them?"
"Yeah, bro, all the time, it's crazy."

"Just look at the arrow, all right."
"No, still, like, so many unemployed."

"Fifty million people unemployed.
How the fuck

is the arrow going up, bro?" "Look,

Jada cheated on Will Smith.

-Chew on that for a little bit."
-[laughing]

"What?"

"Why, Jada, why?"


"What happened?"

"Something about entanglements,
I don't know, it's crazy."

"Just look at the arrow."

"Just look at the fucking arrow."

"No, for real, stop trying
to distract me, bro. How is this arrow

still going up, okay?
Please explain yourself."

"Look, I've got a hot tip for you, okay."

"Cryptocurrency."


"What the fuck is cryptocurrency?"

"It's these little people
inside of a computer."

"And they're just mining.
They're just mining

for these digital coins, okay."

"What you do is,
you move the real fake money

over to theâ€¦


over to the more real fake money."

-[laughing]
-"And what you do is, you just move, once

you have more real fake money,
you move your real fake money over here"

"and you just keep doing that."

"I'm so confused."

"Hey, man, I've got
another hot tip for you. NFT's."

-"What the fuck is a NFT?"
-[shouts and laughing]


"It's a blockchain of ownershipâ€¦"

"You know what, I'm just gonna put
a plastic bag over my head.

Fuck this shit."

[laughing and applause]


Is it real?

COVID's real.

I had it. Dave Chappelle
gave me COVID. That's right.


Well, that was the second time.


But the first time, he hits me up
right at the beginning of the pandemic.

He's like, "Say, Mo, what are you doing?"

I'm like, "I don't know
if you've been watching the news, bro."

"I'm at home, dog, that's what I'm doing."


"That's what you do. We're all at home.
I don't know if you were watching."

He was like,
"Yeah, you can't let them break us."

I'm like, "We're broken, bro."

"The whole country

is broken."

He was like,
"That's why I'm hitting you up."

"I'm gonna do these shows
out in this cornfield in Ohio."

I was like, "I don't know, man,
this doesn't sound very, I'm not sure,

you know." He was like, "No, no."

"We're gonna
test everybody every three days."

"It's gonna be very safe.
We're gonna do the best we can.

Nothing is guaranteed, of course."

"We're gonna do
the best that we can, every--"

I was like,
"You have testing machines, bro? This is

the beginning of the pandemic."


"Like, how did you get testing machines?"
He just went nuts,

He was like,
"Say, nigga, I'm Dave Chappelle.

Of course I got these--"

[cheering and applause]

I was like, "Good point."

Really good point.

So we go, I go to Ohio.

And it was a amazing run of shows, like,

almost four months of doing these shows.

And we almost made it, but

we had outbreaks and we had to stop it.

And he made it into a documentary film.

It's an incredible documentary film.

I saw it at Radio City Music Hall.

It was the first time
that I got to see it.

And then I watched it
and I was like, "Wait,

the end of the movie makes it look like

I ruined the whole fucking party."


I got COVID
and the whole thing had to shut down

because I was being a bitch.

I was like, "Wait, hold on a second."

I walked up to Dave. I'm like, "Dave,

the way you edited this, you made it look

that Mohammed
was the villain in the whole situation."


"That's not the truth, bro. I didn't do--"

He's like, "Ah, man,
nobody's gonna think this."

And right after he walks away

Bradley Cooper walks up.

He's like, "Man, this is
really fucked up how you just

-ruined theâ€¦
-[laughing]

ruined the party in Ohio."

I was like, "It wasn't me."

"An award-winning film maker is saying
that this is what it looks like."

"Oh, no!" And it wasn't my fault.

It was this tiny little lady.
She was really small.

-And she was handsy. Really handsy.
-[laughing]

And she was touching me all the time.
"Hi, Mo." [giggles]

-"Hi."
-[laughing]

Just doing this all the time.

I'm like, "Hey,
stop touching me right now."

"First of all, it's a pandemic.
Like, I don't you that well enough"

"and stop touching me, like--"

And then she fake-coughed in my face.

[fake coughs] Like this.

And I was like,
"I love dark humor, but that's--

-[laughing]
-That's not funny!"

"It's not funny, bitch. It's not funny."

And then she tested positive
three days later.

[audience sympathizes]

I was like,
"I knew she was Israeli. I knew it."

-[laughing and applause]
-I knew it.

I knew it.

They were having a meeting in Hollywood.

They were like, "This Palestinian's
getting too powerful."


"Just send him
this unassuming little gremlin

to try and kill him with COVID."

I survived, bitch! I survived!


That was the first time I got COVID.


The second time,

Dave Chappelle calls me again.


Saying, "Man, what you doing?"

I'm like, "I'm recovering from COVID."


He's like, "I'm gonna do these shows

in Austin. Joe Rogan is gonna be on it."

"It's gonna be dope."

"You should join." I'm like, "Dave,
I don't know if this really worked out

for me the first time."


And he was like, "Nah, man,
this is gonna be different."

"We gonna test every day."

"Last time we were only testing every
three days. We're gonna test every day."

"So we gonna catch that ho

and put her in a closet."


"You'd be straight."
I was like, "Fuck it, let's do it."

-[huffs]
-[laughing]

We're like ten days into doing shows

and Dave walks up to me
and he's like, "Hey, man,

I got this joint from Jay-Z."

I was like, "Word?"

He was like,
"Yeah, I got this joint from Jay-Z."

I was like, "Jay-Z's here?"

He was like, "Nah, man,
Jay-Z has a weed company

and he sent me these joints."


"You wanna go? Let's go roll around
your car and let's smoke this together."

I'm like, "Shit, Dave Chappelle
has a joint from Jay-Z

asking Mo Amer
if he wants to smoke this shit,

you're damn right, I'm gonna smoke
the shit out of this joint."

[cheering and applause]

Obvious.

So then we're cruising
and then he lights up the joint.

And I should've known better!

Because he took a hit
and then he goesâ€¦ [coughs] like this.


I was like, "You okay, Dave?"

He was like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."

"I'm fine. This Jay-Z weed
makes you do Jay-Z impressions likeâ€¦"


[cheering and applause]

I took the joint. I took a couple of hits.
I was like, [coughs]

-"â€¦ djeah-hova!" [chuckles]
-[laughing]

Smoke it.

We laughed. It was a great ride.

And then I dropped Dave off because
it was like 30 minutes until show time.

And then I started texting him,
I was like, "Say, bro,

you want me to swoop you up?"

"Is there special guests,
should I come later?"

And he went silent.
And I was like, "This is weird."

"Dave, we just dropped you off, bro.
This is really odd."

And then friends

started texting me. They haven't
heard from him in, like, weeks.

They were like, "Hey, man, is Dave okay?"

I'm like, "Yeah, Dave's okay."

"You don't know him, that's my boy."

-[laughing]
-"What are you talking about?"

"We just hanging out."

And then they sent me a link.

I was like, "What is this link?"

So I touched the link and it opens up.

And it's TMZ front page news,

"Dave Chappelle tests positive for COVID."

[sympathy from audience]

Then I was like, "This can't be true!"

And then I was like, "Shit,

It's TMZ, they're always right,
these motherfuckers."


I was like,
"How did they know before I knew?"

"I just dropped off Dave."

"He called them before he called me."

"Fuck. That's fucked up, bro."

And then he tried to deny it.

I walked up to him and I was like,

"Dave, it's fucked up you gave me
COVID a second time."

And he goes, "There's no way
to really prove that, Mo."



I was like,
"Bro, the first day you tested positive

I was smoking a joint with you."

"Minutes before you tested positive."

And he got silent and he just goes,

-"I'm sorry I gave you COVID, bro."
-[laughing]


And then he goes,
"Walk it off, at least it's not AIDS."

And he's just walking around like this.

[laughing and applause]

[Mo laughs]

Is it over? [chuckles]

Is it?

-[grunts and laughs]
-[laughing]


So I am done. I had that shit twice. Okay.

Fauci, "Only seven people in the world

have ever gotten it twi--"

Bullshit!

I'm special,
but I'm not that fucking special, Fauci.


So I'm done. I had it twice.

And I'm vaccinated. I'm over it.

I'm over it. I got the Pfizer vaccine.

-[cheering]
-That's what I want.

Everybody has their favorites,
but I went with Pfizer. I wantâ€¦


I want like a German scientist
making my shit,

-you know what I'm saying?
-[laughing]

I want the guy like,

[in fake German accent]
"Yavi, hows the Pfizer? Ya!"

"We knew he was coming out of Wuhan."

"The COVID.
And we are way ahead of schedule."

"Ya! We have the vaccine! The Pfizer!"

-That's the one I want. That's what I--
-[cheering and applause]

The what?

[cheering and applause]

"Yaza!" [chuckles]

"Hmm, ya, iz good, ya,
we have the Pfizer."

-[chuckles]
-[laughing]

-"You have the Pfizer? I have the Pfizer."
-[laughing]


I'm not doing Johnson & Johnson.
I'm not doing that.


I don't even use their regular products.


And they make too many
for my comfort, bro.


You want me to tell you like,
"What's in the Johnson & Johnson?"

"I don't know, man, like we just

started off with
a little snake venom in there."


"And then we just added some
Johnson & Johnson baby powder

-to thicken it up a bit."
-[laughing]

"Some Johnson & Johnson baby oil

to loosen her up a bit."

"Then we put a goddamn baby in there."

-[laughing]
-"Just a whole fucking baby."

"And we finished it off with
a little wild turkey to give it that pop!"

"Know what I mean?"

[laughing and applause]

"How many shots do I take?"

"No shots, we just pass it
mouth to mouth."

"You just come on nowâ€¦"

-[laughs]
-[laughing and applause]

It's so absurd. I-- [huffs]

It's so absurd, like-- [huffs]

Like, vaccines having accents
is so ab-- [chuckles]

What's Moder-- [huffs] What's Moderna?

[imitating Mexican accent]

-[laughing]
-"You got that derna, bro?"

"We give you one shot then you Crip Walk
out this bitch."

You know what I mean.
Like, bra, lets do it?"




-[grunts and exhales sharply]
-[laughing]

Fuck!


That's how I feel inside.

[soft laughing]

I do. That's how I feel inside.
All the time. Fuck.


All the time. I'm justâ€¦




And fuck is just not a potent enough word,
to be honest with you.

It's not strong.

Once you speak another language,

you realize,

you realize that the English language

is just like a newborn, you know.


It is. It's a new language.

Like, I speak Arabic.
Arabic is an ancient language.


English is like it's baby.
It wants to grow up

and be Arabic one day and it's justâ€¦


It is, it's justâ€¦

-[cheering and applause]
-No, it's fine.

It's just a baby.
It's just a baby. It's not a--

It lacks a lot of depth. It's just not,

it's just not very strong, like "fuck",

it's nothing.
It's an exclamation point, you know.

Even greetings in Arabic

-takes so long, you know.
-[soft laughing]

Greetings are like, "Peace be upon you."

"And may peace be upon you."

"And the mercy of the divine be upon you."

"And may the mercy
of the divine be upon you."

"And may divine light be with you."

"May it be unto you as well."

"May it protect you
and your entire linea--"

"Hey, man, can I get this pack
of cigarettes, bro, and get out of here?"

[laughing and applause]

It's a lot.

It's a lot.
In English, it's, "Hi." [laughs]

-That's it. It's over.
-[laughing]


It's over. [chuckles]

"What's up? The sky?" [mock giggles]

That's it, there's nothing else. [laughs]

It's nothing.


So when somebody curses you in English,

sincerely, you could probably walk away

99.9% of the time

if you didn't get emotionally charged.

Really. It's an oldie but a goodie.

"Hey, fuck you!"

"I don't wanna fuck you."

-[laughing]
-And you could, just walk away.

[soft laughing]

"Hey, go fuck yourself!"

"You know what, man?
I've been really tense lately."


"And maybe
what I need to do is go fuck myself."


"Hey, you're a motherfucker."

"Not my mom, butâ€¦"


"My ex-wife
did have child from a previous marriage,

so I guess I am a motherfucker."

[soft laughing]

"And by the way, your father, biggest
motherfucker of them all, technically."

[laughing and a whoop]

"Hey, you're an asshole!"

"You know what,
the eye cannot see itself."



"And I cannot see
when I'm being an asshole,

so thank you for
making me a better person."

And just walk away.

"Hey! You're a pussy!"
"Yeah, I'll take that."

I don't know why
"pussy" always insinuates weakness.

Pussy is metaphorically
and physically very strong.

-[loud cheering]
-So strong!

[cheering and applause]

It's true.

Absolutely true.

It's so strong. It can have a baby.

-Human life.
-[whoop]

Pounds of human flesh

can come out of
this little, tiny hole. Pop!

And it can have two at the same time.
Pop! Pop!


-It can have three. Pop, pop, pop.
-[laughing]

-And then it regeneratesâ€¦ like this.
-[laughing]

Almost. Exactly how it was. Almost.

-[laughing]
-Almost. Exactly how it was.

Maybe if you laugh or cough,
you piss on yourself, but otherwiseâ€¦


Otherwise, it's there.

Ready for you once again. [laughs]



My friend, Chris,

passed a kidney stone
out of his dick hole.


-He damn near died, okay.
-[laughing]

He was like,
"Oh, God, what's happening to me?"

He was like, "Somebody shoot me!"

And it was a grain of sand
that came out of his dick hole.

-Women, "Pop! Pop!" Come back.
-[laughing]

Little grain of sandâ€¦ [groans]


You be a dick.
I'll be a pussy any day of the week.

[loud cheering and applause]

[cheering and whistling]

Arabic curse words.

[soft laughing]

-They're really graphic.
-[laughing]

They're so graphic I don't even use them.
Honestly, I justâ€¦

We're gonna start here and build up.


Like <i>"Kes Emak"</i>,

-which meansâ€¦
-[murmurs]

â€¦"Fuck your mother's pussy!"


Very specific.

-[laughing]
-[Mo huffs]

We take that to another level.

<i>"Kes Emak Eli Nafadek"</i>

-which meansâ€¦
-[laughing]

Which me-- two people,
"Yeah, I know what that means."

-[laughing]
-[chuckles]

Everybody else is on their toes,

"What does it mean?"


It mea-- <i>"Kes Emak Eli Nafadek"</i>

which means,

"Fuck the pussy you slithered out of!"
Wow!

-[shocked laughing]
-[Mo laughs]

<i>Astaghfirullah</i> I know, it's crazy.



Everyone saw the baby fall out.

It's a visual curse word, that one.


This is one of my personal favorites,

<i>"Yela3n Tarekhek"</i>,

Which means,

which means, "Damn your entire history."


"My great-grandmother?" "No, bitch,

from the beginning of timeâ€¦"


"â€¦to present day and everything
in between and in the future,

fuck your DNA."


<i>Astaghfirullah</i>, I don't need this.
It's a lot.

Even Western hand gestures.

Not that big of a deal.

-"Uh, fuck you bro, uh."
-[laughing]

In England it's a reverse peace sign.
Very confusing.

[in fake English accent] "Oh,
fuck off, oh."


And they try to be like,
"No, it's from the war, yeah."

I'm like, "Shut the fuck up, okay.


"It's not that cool."

Arabs, we go to another level.

We go sideways,
we go <i>"BeTizik"</i>, like this.


<i>BeTizik</i>, like that.

<i>BeTizik</i>, like this.

-A little popâ€¦
-[laughing and applause]

-<i>BeTizik</i>, like that.
-[laughing]

Little wiggle.
<i>BeTizik</i>, like that.

<i>BeTizik</i>, likeâ€¦ [laughs]

This means "in your ass."
That's what this means.

-[laughing]
-That's whatâ€¦ [laughs]


And if there's any confusion,
you just put the other hand up like this

and you go <i>BeTizik</i>, like this.


And you wiggle it.

You wiggle it,
all up in the ass, that's right!

[laughing and applause]

I feel like a lot of people
are gonna be leaving here, like,

"Hey, Kyle." "Yeah."

<i>BeTizik</i> bro!


-[Mo laughs]
-[laughing]

Fuck!

[soft laughing]

-[grunting]
-[soft laughing]

-[laughs and soft grunts]
-[laughing]

[in Mexican accent] ...bro.

[soft laughing]

Mexicano's, bro. I love Mexicano's.

[cheering and applause]

Let me say, growing up in Alief,
you can'tâ€¦

[whoop and cheers]

we can't. You can'tâ€¦

You grew up around Mexicano's. You do.

And they always sound like
they're in pain.

[in fake Mexican accent] "Come on, bro,
let's hang out."


"You all right?"
"Yeah, I'm doing fine, bro."

"Are you sure?"

[soft laughing]

Love Mexicano's. They're resilient
people, hard working people.

And it's fucked up they even started
a conversation about putting a wall up.

Shit, this never worked it human history.

And you keep repeating the same bullshit.

First of all, it's Mexicans.

Most creative people I know.
Huh? It's likeâ€¦

[cheering and applause]

So creative, the Palestinians
were taking notes and shit.

When El Chapo snuck out of
that tunnel with a motorcycle,

we're like, [in Arabic accent]
"Hey, Abdallah, come watch, bro."


"Hey, he put
a motorcycle inside a tunnel, bro?"

"We need to do this back home."

<i>Ya Habibi Ya Allah.</i>


You're not gonna stop Mexicans, bro.
It's not gonna work.

Put up a wall and they'll just zipline
back into the country and shit.

They'll be like,

[in Spanish] "Ready, JosÃ©, I'm ready."

Push me, motherfucker.
Come on, go fuck your mother.

[cheering and applause]

[in English] They'd be like,
"Did he make it?"

"I don't know, bro."


"I think he missed the trampoline."


"Ziplining, this is so tricky."


"Timing is everything, bro."

-[laughs]
-[laughing]

If I was Mexican living in Mexico,

I'd flip the whole script.

I would.

I'd be like, "You know what, bro?"

"We're building a wall, okay."


"We're building a wall. You can't come
to CancÃ¹n no more, <i>puto</i>. How about that?"

[laughing and cheering]

How about that?

That's it.

You'd have the White girls--

You'd have
White girls crying all across America.


They're like,
[imitating a girl] "Oh, my God."

"I just wanted to
go to CancÃ¹n for Spring Break."

"Why are they so racist?
I don't understand."


"Now I have to go to Puerto Vallarta."


That's also in Mexico.
[girl voice] "Oh, my God!"


[soft laughing and applause]

Love Mexicano's. I love doing accents.
It's a lot of fun, you know.

When you can do them like,

[in fake Mexican accent]
"Come on, let's hang out, it's--"

It's fun. The German's fun.

[in fake German accent] "Ya, ooh,
it's lovely here."


I mean, I fuck with them all day.

Russians though,

-I don't fuck with Russians.
-[cheers and laughing]

I don't fuck with anybody
that talk like this,

[in fake Russian accent]
"What you say to me?"


"You fuck me, my family?
What you say to me?"

"I'm good, bra. I don't trust you."

-[nervous laugh]
-[laughing]

A Russian guy
in an Adidas tracksuit. I'm good.

[in fake Russian accent] "What
you say to me? You fuck around?"

[laughing and applause]

"What you say?"
"I'm good, bra."

"I'm gooâ€¦"

I don't fuck with
anybody with a Russian accent

and I don't fuck with anybody
with cauliflower ears.


I don't fuck with them.

And if you talk like this
and you have cauliflower MMA ears,

I don't fuck with you either, bro.


That's how I knew Khabib Nurmagomedov

was gonna be
the greatest MMA fighter of all time.

-[cheers and applause]
-All time.


[in fake Russian accent] "He
talk like this.

And he has the ears."
Fuck that, I'm not fucking with you, bro.

You're a real one.
And the way he talks is terrifying.

[Russian accent]
"Oh, you think you're real?

You think you're from streets?"

"I grow up in real mountain."

Like, "What does that mean, bro?"


"What does that mean?"

"What do you mean you grew up there?"

"What did you do there?" [laughs]

He'll say wild shit like,
"Oh, yeah, you want to fight?"

"I'm gonna change his face."


"What is he, Potato Head, bro?
You can't do this."


You can't fuck with him. The guy-- The man
wrestled bears as an eight-year-old.

This is, you can really look this up.
He wrestled bears

as an eight-year-old child.

The only people that would do this,
is Dagestani's.

Because there's levels to being Russian.
There's like regular Russian,

there's Chechnyan,
and there's Dagestani's!

It's a whole another level,
where they wrestle bears, apparently.

And from childhood.
What the fuck are you talking about?

His father, God rest his soul,
were the greatest

coaches of all time.

And how did that conversation even happen?

Like he walked up to his dad like,
[in fake Russian accent] "Daddy."


"Daddy, I really
want to be great champion."

"Daddy, please, please, train me, Daddy."

Like, "No, son, you're not ready."

"No, I'm ready. Please, please."

"Train me, Daddy." "Okay."

"I go get bear. Let's see."


Brought a bear into the house.
What did his mom say?

"Hey, honey, what you doing with bear?"

"I know, I know."

"Relax, bear, relax."


"I bring bear. Okay." [laughs]

"I bring bear.
Bear gonna wrestle Khabib."

"Khabib one day will be great champion."

-"Defeat racist leprechaun in the future."
-[laughing]

"Save Islam.

<i>Alhamdulillah.</i> Come on."

[cheering and whistling]


Germans, I'll fuck with them all day.

[in fake German accent] "Ooh, ya,
it's wonderful."


I did that accent at my first special

and a lot of people messaged me like,
"Hey, man,

you sound like
that fat caterpillar from <i>A Bug's Life</i>."


I was like, "No, I don't."
And then I watched it and I was like,

"Ah, shit, I do sound like that fat--"

It's like, [German accent] "Ya, look
at my wings. I'm a beautiful butterfly."

-[laughs]
-[laughing]




It's such a blessing to be together.
Listen, let me tell you something.

I sincerely,

I am mad at
what they did to us. I really am.

The fear that they created.

And the division they created.

It's fucking infuriating.

"Who you voting for? Red or blue?"

What am I, Bloods or Crips?
That's what I heard. That's all I heard.

All you are gangsters. Okay.

Okay, all of you are gangsters.
I'm with the people.

Always will be with the people.
That's what it is about for me.

When the hurricane came through,

my neighbor, Scott, redneck Scott,

this guy is the best. Okay.

He's always prepared.
So I'm never prepared,

because I know he's prepared.


He's always like, "Yeah. I got generators.
Hell yeah, I got generators."

"Fuck, yeah, Mohammed, I got you, baby."
You know.


When I came through he hooked me up, bro.

I plugged into the side of his house
and took that extension cord

all the way across that cul-de-sac
and plugged my shit in.

And that's what it's about, bro.

They're trying to separate us,
but the fact is

Mohammed's in Texas

get along with redneck Scotts all day.

[cheers and applause]

Fuck what you talking about.

Fuck what you talking about.

That's the honest truth.

People try to just push
this particular agenda

and it's not, I do believe in us.

I do. I believe in us and then

and then I travel
and then I go to an airport

and I realize
how fragmented we really are.

We suck as the human race.

We suck. [laughs]

We're all in our own bubbles.

Nobody's paying attention to anybody else.

Everybody just--
You'll see this in an airport.

You'd be walking and all of a sudden
the person in front of you just stops

and just looks up.

"What's up there?"
"I'll tell you what's behind you, bitch."

-"Thousands of people."
-[laughing]

"Trying to get where they want to go."

"That's what the fuck is going on."

"What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Get the fuck out of the way, all right."

[soft laughing]

If you're travelling

with a carry-on with no wheels on it,

-you're an asshole, okay.
-[laughing]

You just have them all over your shoulder.
You're a fucking mess. [panting]

It's sliding off. "Oh, sorry." [panting]

Wheels exist. What's the matter with you?

[soft laughing]

If you have
a carry-on with only two wheels,

this is what you look like,
"Hi." [giggles]

Look how much
square footage you're taking behind you.

Why the fuck are you doing this?
"Hi." [giggles]

-[fake laughs]
-[laughing]

What the fuck are you doing?
Four wheels exist, man.

This is what you look like in four wheels.

Like a smart, intelligent human being.

You can go forward.
You can go backwards on that <i>whore</i>.

You can juke a motherfucker
and just keep going.


You have a baby, you put him on top of it
and you keep it cruising.


Now if you have a four wheel carry-on
and you only use two wheels,

you're probably the biggest asshole
of them all.


We can't even read numbers.

We get to the boarding gate

and they're like, "Boardingâ€¦"

"Boarding group one."

[high pitched voice] "I'm in seven,
can I go?" [giggles]

"Well, what he--"
"I'm in eight since seven's going."

"Get the fuck out of the way.
What are you doing?"


Then you get on the plane

and here comes the people
with no wheels on their bags. [panting]

Just clotheslining every other person.

-[thumping noises]
-[laughing]

They have no clue, they justâ€¦ [panting]

And here comes the assholes
with two wheels on their bags.

-Just dragging it behind themâ€¦
-[laughing]

â€¦and they're getting stuck
every other seat.

"Sorry, sorry." [fake laughs]

"Sorry." [fake laughs]

Turn it around, whore,
and see where you're going.

[laughing and applause]

Use your eyes.

Maneuver.


Drives me insane. [laughs]

Flight attendants, all due respectâ€¦


Well, I would wait
to finish the bit, bro. [laughs]


It's not good.

You're not saving anyone, all right.

You take your job
way too seriously. [laughs]


Somebody has an issue, you just go,

"Is there a doctor here? Because

I don't know what I'm doing.
Please, somebody."


If you have a little bag
and it's a bulkhead,

and you have it on the floor, oh, shit.

[loud breathing] "We have to put this bag

over here." They'll short-circuit on you.
"We have to put this

bag up top, okay. Just for take off.
And they will give it to you

immediately after take-off, okay."

"Well, then, if you gonna give it to me
after take-off,

immediately after take-off,

then why the fuck
have I got to move it in the first place?"

"Just in case we have an

emergency exit situation."

"Wait, we're gonna exit the plane?"

"At like 150 miles an hour?"

"What the fuck are you talking about?"

"No, no, no, we have to move the bag."

"According to the FA-A-A-A-A."

-[imitates explosion]
-[laughing]

Shut down.

God damn shut down.

God, the safety announcements. Oh, my God.

"Put on your seatbelt, everybody."

"Because that's
what's gonna save your life. Okay."

"Yes, a seatbelt

from 35,000 feetâ€¦


â€¦to pummel into your imminent death.
Okay."

"On a floating rock in space."

"That's what's
gonna save you, is a seatbelt." No.

They just want your ass in the seat

after the plane crashes.

They don't want to have to hire
a third-party company

to look for your bitch ass.

-[laughing]
-That's all it is.

They don't.

They just want to
get there after the crash,

"Adams 3F. There he is, yup."

-[laughs]
-[laughing]

-"Well, most of him, right." [laughs]
-[laughing]

It's all they want.


Because if they really thought
the seatbelt was gonna save your life,

they would check every single person

as if it's a roller coaster ride, right.

They'd be like,
"You're good. You're good. You're good."

"You goo-- Oh, you almost died, Ralph!"

-[laughing]
-"You almost died."

They don't do that shit.

They just walk by.
"You're good. You're fine. Fine."


One flight attendant
started to argue with me,

"No, Mo, what if
we're having a crash landing

and we have real bad turbulence,

you could fly up
and you could break your neck!"

I'm like, "That's what I want.
I want to break my neck."

"I want to be the motherfucker
like this while everybody's

screaming for their lives.
That's what I want."

And while everybody's like,
"Oh, my God! Were gonna die!"

-I'm already dead. I'm good to go.
-[laughing]

Just smacking motherfuckers
with no wheels on their bags.

-[smacking noises]
-[laughing]

That's what I want.

[soft laughing]


Yes, I remember,

if we lose cabin pressure,

me first, fuck the baby.


The little oxygen thing comes down.
Me first, fuck the baby.

Not my rule. Your rule.


Flew in from New York to Houston. Okay.

I live here, but we flew in
from New York to Houston

and there's not
a single body of water in sight.

But we have to worry about
this flotation device, everybody.

You put the thing on over and you

buckle up the front.

And then you pull the stringâ€¦
[swoosh noise] like that.

And it will inflate.

But if it doesn't inflate, don't panic!

There's a straw right here.


That only, apparently,
requires one breath.

One magical breath.

They make this shit look so easy.
Justâ€¦ [blows]

"You're fine everybody, you're fine."

Bitch, have you ever tried to inflate

anything manually in your whole life?


I did my nephew's pool party.

I damn near died doing his floaties.


You're telling me in the middle
of a crash landing, we'll be likeâ€¦

-[screams and blows]
-[laughing]

Dead.


Don't worry, there's a second
and third layer of protection, okay.

There's a little flickering light, okay.

It's not even a light.
It's a reflective light

the size of a dime, I shit you not.

The size of a dime and a whistle. Okay.

In the vast, echo-y,
reflective oceans of the Earth,

this is how we're gonna find
your bitch assâ€¦ [mock whistle noise]

"I'm right here." [mock laughs]

[whistle noise] "I'm right here."
[mock laugh]

[whistle noise]
"You haven't found the Malaysia plane."

-[laughing]
-"An entire jumbo jet, bitch."

[cheers and applause]

You're gonna find
my bitch ass, just floating aroundâ€¦

[whistle noise] "I'm right here."

[whistle noise] "I'm right here."

You just told all
the ocean's predators your exact location.

You're dead. <i>BeTizik</i>
is what I'm saying.

-[grunts]
-[laughing and applause]

[grunting and laughs]

-[laughs]
-[laughing]

Fuck!


For the first time, for the first time
I ever felt this way in my life.

I'm a refugee that came to America,
I'm an American citizen, of course, now.

But, you know, for the first time

everybody that was making fun
of Texas in California,

right in the middle of the pandemic,

"Oh, we need to go to Texas." Yeah?

"You need to come here?"
For the first time I felt this way,

"Go back to where
you came from, son of a bitch."


-"You're fucking up our real estate."
-[cheers and applause]

"Go back home." That's how I feel.

That's howâ€¦

I was like, "I get why they do it.
It felt good, a little bit. It felt good."

[soft laughing]

I am an Arab-American. That's what I am.

Didn't do it. Yup.

[cheering and applause]

Palestinian-Arab-Amer-- This isâ€¦

-[cheering and whistling]
-Listen.

Thank you.

All right, let's start that party.
Let's do it.

Here's the thing.
I'm not doing that for applause.

I did that just to tell you
that's how you identify yourself.

I am an Arab-American.
That's how it works here in America.

If you're not White,

you have something before American.


Unless when I'm buying a gun.
That's the only time.

When you're buying a gun in Texas,
the first question is,

"Are you hispanic?"

Super racist. "No." [laughs]

Next, "Are you African-Americ--"
"No." [laughs]

And then there, has no Arab-American.

I was like, you know what, fuck it,
"I'm White as fuck today."

"Give me that
double barrel, 12 gauge shot gun, baby."


But all the other times,

all the other times, I'm Arab-American.

You're not White in America,
you have something before American.

That's how it works out.

That's just the way it is. [laughs] Okay.

Unless you're White. You're just White.

Everybody else,
something right before American.

Even Natives. Natives are natives.

-Native Americans. We got to identifyâ€¦
-[laughing]

â€¦the Native Americans.

African Americans. Most of my
Black friends have never been to Africa.

Nonetheless,
they're African Americans anyway.

Mexican-Americans, Asian-Americans,
and so forth and so on.

Unless you're White.

If you're White, you just sprouted
from the corn fields of Ohio.


And you just
spread across this great land.

Unless it's Saint Paddy's day,
then you're like,

"Oh, shit, my great-granddaddy
was a quarter Irish."

[laughing and applause]


That's what I am though,
an Arab-American. And I got to say,

as an Arab-American,

I find it really fascinating
to see our culture

spreading throughout the West.

Really fascinating. It is.

[cheering and applause]

It's pretty damn cool.

Like, if you don't know what a hookah is,

you're like culturally ignorant.

And if you don't know what a hookah isâ€¦

"You don't know what a hookah is, Denise?
Where have you been?" [giggles]

"It's like this bong,
but it's not. It's like

so ornate and it has

all these different tobaccos flavors.
And then

there's this pipe that comes out.
And you just prrr."

"Blow it out, it's so--
We can get two pipes

and we can brrr together, Denise.
Oh, my God." [laughs]

And then White people saw this,
which is amazing.

You got to give it up.
They distilled it into a battery and put

a cartridge on top of it

with some mysterious liquid
that nobody's questioning.


Everybody just walk around likeâ€¦ [snorts]

-[growly exhale]
-[laughing]

"It's perfectly healthy."

"Bro, I've never seen
that much smoke come out of a hookah."


"Much less this little device."

"You're changing weather climates
on a regular basis."

"What the fuck is going on?"

"No, it's healthy." [mock laughs]

[snorts and growly exhale]

"It can't be, bro.
It's a metal with some battery

hooked up to some metal.
I'm sure you're fucked."

"Please stop doing this."


That's the first
public service announcement.

[soft laughing]

The second public service announcement,

something that Redd Foxx
actually tried to spread in America

in the early 70's.

And I would say that most Muslims
living in the West

are all wondering whyâ€¦

nobody wash their ass.
I'm just gonna say it. [laughs]

-[laughing]
-[cheers and applause]

It's really weird.

Please wash your ass. [laughs]

It's really weird that bidets are
like not the norm, you know what I mean?

Why is toilet paper
the first and only option?

It's like, that's it.
It's like leaves, toilet paper,

baby wipes, and water.

Why? Why would you do this?

It's obvio-- Everybody's eating ass.

Nobody's washing their ass. It's crazy.

[loud laughing]

It's crazy.

If you got shit on you, you're like,

"Oh, my God, I got shit."
You would wash it off right away.

You're like, "Oh, I'm okay now."

"I got the shit off of me."

But when you go, you're like, "I'm fine."
And you just walkâ€¦



My cousin came to visit me from back home.

And he was like,
"Hey, I want to try five-star hotel."

I'm like, "Bro, of course.
Enjoy yourself."

And he does it. And I said,
"Hey, man, I'll pick you up

at noon at the mall. Next day."
He was like, "Okay."

And I picked him up the next day

and I see him,
he had this really upset look on his face.

I'm like, "What's going on, bro?"

He was like this.
I'm like, "What's going on, bro?"

He was like, <i>"Allah Yoqrifhem"</i>.

<i>"Allah Yoqrifhem"</i>.

I was like,
"Bro, you can't be yelling Allah

in the middle of
the Galleria Mall like this."

-[laughing]
-"What are you doing?"

"Relax."

"What's the problem?"
He goes, "They don't have a bidet."

"They don't have a bidet.
Five star hotel!"

"Not one star, two star,
three star, four star,

five star hotel! No bidet."

"Every time I go to the bathroom,
I have to take a shower."


"I've taken five showers today, Mo."


"I'm more worried about
your digestional tract, bro."


"Five shits before noon.
What are you doing?"


"Stop eating at IHOP, okay."


My friend Nick came over.

I upgraded all my toilets
after my first Netflix special.

Those Japanese toilets.

And my friend Nick
walks into the bathroom.

He walks right back out.
He's like, "Hey, Mo,

why does, uh, your toilet have a remote?"


I was like, "Oh, because it has
a built-in bidet and blow dryer."

He was like, "What's a bidet?"

I was like, "You don't know
what a bidet is?" He was like, "No."

I was like, "Oh, my God, I failed you."

-[laughing]
-I was likeâ€¦

I was like, "A bidet is

once you go boo-boo,

it sprays water up your-- around your ass
and washes your ass."

His response to me was, "Ew."

I was like, "Ew?"

I'm like, "Nick, you're the 'ew'
in this equation, bro."

Get in there and wash your ass.

[laughing and applause]

[cheering and applause]

He was in there for like 20 minutes, man.

He came out like he was baptized.
He was likeâ€¦

He was likeâ€¦ [sing-song] Ah-ah-ah!

[laughing and applause]

He had a stride in his step.
A new confidence I've never seen before.


Second public service announcement.

The third one

starts off with a question.

Imagine it's World War II era. Okay.

Very important. Imagine it's
World War II era in America.

And I'm walking around
the States like, "Hey,

would you like to try some of this sushi?"

They'd be like, "Oh, what's sushi?"
You'd be like,

"Sushi is a Japanese dish."

They'd be like, "Japanese!"

"Get this damn Jap-food out of my face!"

[soft laughing]

Probably what they would say.

[soft laughing]

Now imagine it's September 12th,

2001,

and I'm walking around
the States like, "Hey,

would you like to try
some of this hummus?"

They'd be like, "Oh, what's hummus?"

I'm like, "Oh,
hummus is a very Arab dish."

They'd be like, "Arab!" [bash noise]

"Get this damn
sand-nigga-al-Qaida-food out of my face!"


It's probably what they would say.

[soft laughing]

Here's a very important clarification,

the way you say it is "hummus".
It's an "h". It's a "ha". Okay.

Jews, it's not
[Jewish accent] hummus. Okay.

[Jewish accent] It's not hummus.
It's not hummus.

"Ghe" is a different letter
in our alphabet. Okay.

In our lang--
"Ghe" is a completely different letter.

You don't have the "ghe" in your language.
So obviously it's not yours.

Back the fuck up. It's our hummus.

[cheering and applause]

Back up.

It's what it is. All right.

And now hummus is everywhere.

"Oh, I want some hummus."

Hummus, some shitty hummus everywhere.

Fucking coffee shops have hummus.

Seven Elevens have hummus.

Every gas station, hummus, hummus, hummus.

I was on a flight
and the flight attendant comes up,

"Would you like
to have a little light snack?"

I looked at it. I was like,
"What the fuck is this?"

She's like, "This is hummus."

I was like, "No, it's not."
This is a little juice box situation.

You rip off a little corner and you get
a little potato chip like this.

And you squeeze it out.

Just metaphorically shitting
on my entire lineage.

-"Fuck your history." That's how it feels.
-[laughing and applause]

That's how it feels.

"Fuck your grandmother with every shit

of hummus
that comes out of this thing. Ugh."

It's not hummus.

[soft laughing]

I went to Trader Joe's
and they have those samples like,

"Hey, would you like to try
a some of this chocolate hummus?

I was like, "What the fuck?
It's chocolate hummus."


And then I just fainted
like building seven. I just fainted.

[soft laughing]

We got to talk about it at some point.


Went to this South African

fine dining South African restaurant when
we were filming the movie in Atlanta.

And the waiter comes over and he's like,

"Say, bra, we have some
red bean hummus here."

I was like,
"What the fuck did you just say?"

He goes, "We have some
red bean hummus here."

I was like,
"Bro, are there chickpeas in this?"

He goes, "Nah, bra, it's red bean hummus."

I was like,
"Bitch, hummus means chickpeas!"


This is refried beans, dog.

[laughing and applause]

<i>Frijoles refritos</i> homie.

"You're pawning off Mexican food now?"

"As hummus? Get this shit out of my face!"

Hummus is very simple.

It's four ingredients,
sometimes five. That's all it is.

You get your chickpeas, tahini paste,

lemon juice, salt, sometimes garlic. Okay.

You get your food processor out.

It's like a little science experiment.

Put it all in there, you're likeâ€¦
[blending noise]

"No, no, no. More tahini paste."
[blending noise]

"No, no, no. More lemon juice."
[blending noise]

You're like, "Fuck, it's all lemon juice."
More chickpeas. More tahini paste.

"Fuck, it's all tahini paste again."

"More lemon juice." [blending noise]

Like, "Fuck, it's all lemon juice.
Needs salt."

"Chickpeas and tahini paste."
[blending noise]

You're like, "Fuck, more tahini paste."

You're like, "Oh, that's perfect."

[cheering and applause]

Now you have 20 pounds
of hummus right here.




This is very important.

You scoop out the hummus
and you put it in a bowl.

Okay. You put the hummus in a bowl!

You don't put it on a flat plate.

Nobody know how to dip

on a flat plate, bro.

-You got like race track marks everywhere.
-[laughing]

You got hummus coming over the sides.

Complete chaos.

You need a bowl to help you
with the scoop situation. Okay.

Now we're not done yet.

You got that bowl of hummus and

you make a little crater right
in the middle.

Grab some fresh chickpeas, you put it
right in the middle for texture. Okay.

And then you grab some olive oil.
Not that clear yellow shit.

Some deep green olive oil.

"Oh, what do I do with that?"

"Do I just drizzle,
a little drizzle of garnish?"

-"No, whore. You turn it overâ€¦
-[laughing]

â€¦and you hold it. Okay."

"One Mississippi, two, three, four."

"If you think it's too much,
it's not enough. Keep it going."


Okay.

I like to finish it off
with a little lemon juice.

And some diced up jalapenos.

And I put them on each corner like that.

Now if I serve you

this extremely authentic
Palestinian hummus

and you grab a carrot,

I'm gonna fuck you up, okay.


"I just want to try it
and I'm watching my carbs."

"It's not for you, ho. Back the fuck up!"


You need some fresh hot,

fresh hot steamy pita bread.

You rip off a little corner like this.

And you put it together.
And it just binds because it's so steamy.

You make a perfect cone

and when you dip, you dip like thisâ€¦

You dip towards yourself.

You don't dip out!

You're like, "Oh, I wanna taste like
what it's like on that side."

"Bitch, it's the same hummus
on each side. Okay."

[laughing and applause]

"Nobody wants your stinky ass fingers
in their hummus, all right."

"Oh, but I wanna taste
what's on that side."

"You know what, I'm gonna put a wall
right in the middle of the hummus."

[cheering and applause]

"Put a wall right here."

All right. That side is hummus.

This side is hummus.

I was looking for a one-bowl solution,

but you won't share, so

<i>BeTizik</i> is what I'm saying.

[cheering and applause]

Thank you so much, Houston. I love you.

Thank you so much.

[cheering and applause]

Take a seat, take a seat.

What a beautiful thing.
What a beautiful gathering.

I take all of this very, very seriously.

I'm gonna tell you why

it's all so important to me.

It took me 20 years to get my citizenship.

It's talked about in my first special.

I am Palestinian

and it was the first time I was able to
actually go back to Palestine.

-[whoops and cheers]
-Because you're not allowed,

you're not allowed to go back, even though

my mother's born there,
my great-grandmother's born there,

my grandmother, my great-grandmotherâ€¦

We have a thousand years of history there.

Still cannot go there

until you get your US passport.
And it's still an obstacle

when you get there, you know.

When you first get there, like,

"Where you from?"

"Bitch, where are you from?"


And she said, "Uzbekistan."

It's tough.

It's a difficult thing.

You always think about going home.

Your mom talks about it. You see

my family back home.
And you want to go see it.

Don't get me wrong,

I'm saying "back home",
this is my home too.

This is my house.

-My father is buried here.
-[cheers and applause]

You understand?


[Mo sighs] So we went,

for the first time I went to Burin,

a little village short of Nablus,

where my family is from.

It was beautiful. I got to see my aunts.

Amazing, cooking up feasts.

This didn't get here
by no accident. [laughs]

Some home cooking. You know.

Sitting there with my aunts
and I'm looking out over the landscape,

thinking about my ancestors,
thinking about my father,

thinking about my history.

I'm like, "Wow, I need to go
to my grandparent's house,

who are no longer with us."

I was like, "I have to go
to my grandparent's house."

"I have to see where my mother was born."

"I have to see this,
please take me over there."

So they take me over there.
And I just sit and of course

I had tears of joy and happiness.

So much going on

and we go to the rooftop.
I'm like looking around.

I'm like breathing in the air
soaking it all up. I'm like, "Ah."

And I see these walls.

These walls everywhere
and it's sad, but, you know.

It is very sad and hopefully we can get
past this at some fucking point.

But I'm looking out into the village.
I'm focused on the village.

And I see this mosque
in the middle of the village.

And I look at my cousin,

I was like, "How long has
that mosque been there?" He's like,

"Hundreds of years.

Like it's been there for
a hot minute, bro."

I was like, "I have to go pray there."

"I have to go pray there. I'm sure

my father prayed there, my grandfather,

my great-grandfather.
I have to go pray there."

He was like, "Let's go."

So we go. And I prayed there.
I was meditating.

I was like, "Wow, what a beautiful thing,
experiencing this.

This is amazing."

And then these,
like, five other guys were like,

looked up at the clock
and they were like, "Hey, man,

it's time for our <i>Maghrib</i> prayers."
I'm like, "What?"

He was like, "Yeah,
go do the call for prayer right now."

I'm like, "Bro, I'm not gonna do
the call for prayer.

I just got here, bro."


They were like, "But you have the beard."
I'm like, "Not you too, bro."

"I'm just fat.

I don't want everybody to see
the chin. You know what I'm saying?"

Then he's like,
"No, you have to do the call for prayer."

"The time is now
and you have to do the call for prayer."

I'm like, "Bra, I'm not gonna do
the call for prayer."

And they're like,
"You have to do the call for prayer."

And they're like,
"You don't know the call for prayer?"

I was like, "Yeah, of course
I know the call for prayer."

"But I had to go and
speak into that microphone,

a little tiny little microphone."

"For the whole village, bro?"

"I performed in front
of thousands of people,

but this is a lot of stress, bro.
Scared to make mistakes."

"There are religious implications
to this situation."

And they're like, "No, you have to do it."
I was like, "Okay, I'll do it!"

And I walk up

and I was like, "Cousin, be
next to me because I'm nervous.

Make sure I don't mess up."


Throughout the whole entire village.

And I'm overcome. I was like,
"Oh, my God, this is amazing."

"What is this thing
that's been written for me?"

"I can't believe this happened."

Right as I'm thinking this a man just

crashes right into the mosque.
[crash noise]

"Who did the call for prayer?" Like this.

And everybody sells me out.

"This guy. This guy
did the call for prayer."


"This guy did the call for prayer."

I was like, "Forget you all, man.

You forced me to do the call for prayer!"

He's like, "Why did you do it?"
I was like,

"I just told you
they forced me to do the call for prayer."

He goes, "Well, you just
did it ten minutes early, bro."

"You did it ten minutes early."

I was like, "That clock is flashing, man.
It's saying it's time."

He goes, "That clock
is ten minutes ahead."

I was like, "I didn't know that.
That's a digital clock.

Push the little buttons

-and it will fix the whole thing. Okay."
-[laughing]

"You want me to do it?"

And he goes, "Wait, wait, wait, wait."

"I've been in the village my entire life."

"I know everyone in the village."

"Who are you? I've never seen you before."

"Who was your father?"

I tell him who my father is.

He goes, "Oh, my God."

He goes, "Oh, my God."

"Your father is Mustafa?"

I was like, "Yes, my father is Mustafa."

He goes, "You know who installed
the sound system in this mosque?"

"Your father did."


It was truly one of
the most beautiful things

I have ever experienced in my life.

And I had to tell you this story.

Because just because I'm Palestinian

and I'm forced to live where I am,

it's not what it is.

Houston is the city that raised me.

And now Netflix is the label that pays me.

-[loud cheering]
-I love y'all.

Thank you so much, Houston,
I love you guys.

[cheering and applause]
