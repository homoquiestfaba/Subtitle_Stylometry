Just give me some time.

A little time.

Yeah.

Cut, print.
Beautiful.

Jack, you good?

Yeah, she's good.

All right, check the gate.
Moving on.

Okay, Jean Marie.

Did you hear about
the strike coming up?

No.
No?

There's not gonna be
too much work around.

No.

Be a good time
to have a friend like Jack.

I got it.
Excuse me.

Yeah, l--

No, I got it.

You going to the bar tonight?
How about a drink?

Hey, that looked so good.
Thanks.

You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

You all right?
All right.

Good job, Sam.
My turn?

Yeah, so we'll just place you
right in here and--

With all that glass?

Well, we'll sweep it out
a little bit,

but that's your deal.

And then you just exit frame,
and that's the shot.

Is this a close-up?

[sultry rock music]

¶ ¶

Whoo!

¶ He left and flew overseas ¶

Can I get a beer
and two shots of vodka?

Sure.

Excuse me.

Hi.

Hi.
Hi.

What can we get you?

Uh...

Coke and--

Ice?

Ice?

Ice.

I've already
done my laundry.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can we get a drink?

You're kind of cute.

Yeah, we'll give it to you
on the house.

Whiskey?
Neat.

Neat.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.

¶ I'm proud of who I am ¶

¶ This is where I'm going ¶

Two shots.

Two vodkas.

You're not drinking
with her, are you?

Here's your beer.

¶ Settled down
in the Midwest ¶

[people chattering]

Yeah. Here's--

Whoo!

I'll bring yours back.

That's not--

No, l--

Whoa!

Did you see that?

What are you doing
to our girl, man?

Miss B.

Come on.

Let's behave, girls.

Yeah.

Good night, baby.

I'm gonna grab some air.
Cover for me?

Yeah, I got you.

You mind if I join you?

I don't care.

You handled yourself
pretty good in there.

Probably right out of a job.

I handle female fighters,
and I'd like to talk to you.

[laughs]

I think you got something.

I can see it in your eyes.

That's a lame pickup line.

What color are my eyes?

Blue...

with a little touch
of hazel.

You seem
like a really nice guy.

I'm just not interested.

Okay.

There's a lot of money
to be made,

if you're interested.

Hey, you want to come in
for a drink?

I used to manage
Sonya Sorenson, Tucker Ramirez.

I've been in this business
for years.

It used to be
just entertainment.

Now with this phenomenon
of female fighting,

it's gotten really compet--

Can you
just cut to the chase?

You see, there are
these special fights

in private
high-class locations.

How much?

$500 to $1,000
for the prefights.

How many?

One, two, sometimes three.

Not much time in between.

There are only three rounds.

What's the catch?

None.

See, there are whole circuits
all around the country--

different cities,
different places,

really affluent people.

Major money.

Look, you think about it.

If you’re interested,
meet me at 9969 Meadows Lane,

off the 7.

Wear workout clothes.

Let's say at 2:00 p.m.?

How many fighters
do you manage now?

I'm rebuilding.

Hey.

[intercom beeps]

Slide over.

Trust me.

Whoa, whoa!

Hey, Sonny, it's been a while.
Hey.

Hey,
what can I do for you?

I'm hear to see Refugio.

And I don't remember seeing
your name on the list.

Um, why don't you just tell
Lilly that I'm here, okay?

Look at the girl I brought.

You're okay.

Thank you.

[laughing]

Come here, sweetheart.

If I win, does that mean
I get to be on top?

[both laugh]

Otra vez, otra vez, Refugio.

Take a breather, hon.
Take a breather.

Aw, Sonny.

How you doing, big boy?
How are you?

How did you get in here?

I crawled in between
a couple of rocks.

Listen, I got someone
I'd like you to look at.

Card's full, man.
I got no more room.

Maybe at the end of the day.
You know what?

No, no, this one, okay?

Just do me a favor.
Have a look at her.

Come on.

Hey, don't forget
how you got this job.

Aw, man, you always use
that one. Come on.

I'm not hearing.
I'm not listening.

Just have a look,
all right?

All right.
Okay, good.

Come on, Maxine.

Let's go.

Come into me.

Okay, get ready.
Warm up.

Duck.

Come on, concentrate, honey.

Duck.

Come on.
Here, go again.

Back up.

All right, good.
Keep breathing.

Next girl.

Cindy Martinez.

Okay.

Cindy Martinez!

Cindy Martinez.

Cindy Mart--

Right here, right here.

Cindy, come on.
Follow my lead, okay?

Are you kidding me?

Yeah.
It's either now or never.

Come on. Come on.

Hold on a minute.
Name?

Cindy Martinez.

[laughs]

All right.

Okay, Cindy.

Let's see what you can do,
Miss Cindy Martinez.

Okay, listen.

You come on.

You got
a couple different punches.

You got your jab.
You got your cross.

Hook, hook.

Uppercut, uppercut.

Start off with just a jab.

Jab, cross.

Jab, cross.

Jab, cross, hook, hook.

Jab, cross, hook, hook.

Nice.

Give me a combo,
whatever you can.

Hey.

Okay, uh--

What do you think?

Where did you find her?

She was working at a bar.

Okay.

Does she know
what she's getting into?

Did you tell her?

Kind of.

[laughs]

You always say that too.

Who really cares as long
as she gets me to The Show?

Okay.

Where's your sister?

Leave that one out of here,
and I'll help her out.

Let's see.

Sonny?
All right, Miss Martinez.

Sonny, where are you?

Where have you been?

How do I look?

Oh, Lilly, Lilly.

You look exquisite.

I need a favor.

You see the blonde lady
in there?

I need you to okay her.

Watch your wrist.
There you go, again.

All right.

Good.

Refugio.

Nice.

Hold it.
Hang on.

Hey, come here.

You've just been cleared
for your first fight.

Congratulations.

You sure I'm ready?

You're ready enough
for the girl you'll be fighting.

This is a test of will,
not talent.

Good luck.

Refugio.

Samantha.

Good luck.
Have a good one.

Okay, next girl.

Nasha, we got Nasha.

Hello.
Hi.

Delighted.

What about me?

Back to your place.

[yelling in Russian]

Niña necia.
Cállate ya!

[yelling in Russian]

Okay. Póngase rápido. Vamos.
We can do it.

I don't think any of these
girls are in your league.

You got nothing
to worry about, baby.

I'm not worried.

I'm gonna take care
of some business.

I'll talk to you later.

Okay.

Bye.
I'll see you.

Look, if you don't buy it,
just call it in.

All right, this is good.

It's just a prefight,
nothing to worry about much.

If you win, the odds will go up.
That's all.

Sonny.

Wow.

You still hanging out
around here?

I thought they had
the place exterminated.

Hello, darling.

It's my pleasure.

Why don't you take a hike,
Nedish?

Why don't you show
some manners

and introduce me
to this lovely lady, please?

Sam, this is Nedish.

Nedish, this is Sam.

Just another fight promoter.

Not just another
fight promoter

but the best, actually.

At your service.

I'm Samantha.

Sam, we have to go.

Nice to see you.

You too, Sonny.

Die.

I'll see you soon, Sam.

How do you know that guy?

He's a very dangerous man,
Nedish.

Long story.

[engine rumbling]

Where have you been?

You're late.

Do you have a car?

It's another long story.
Come on.

Come on, baby.

Stay in the fight.

[grunting]

She's out.

Who's your daddy now?

Whoo!

You're next.

All right, no biting,
no poking in the eyes.

Back to your corners.

[screaming]

Come on, ref, separate them.

Come on, baby, take them back.

Take--take them back.

Roll her over.

Roll her over.

Choke her.

Put your hooks in.
Put your hooks in.

That's pretty good, girlie.

Looks like you got a star.

9, 10, 11, 12.

Let's pack it up, babe.

Hey.

How do you feel?

Felt okay.

Are all these fights
so wild and unpredictable?

Well, this was
a little sloppy, disorganized.

Ref was useless.

But just look at it
like a test.

They get a lot harder

when the fighters
are more experienced.

It's not a bad day.

I just made 1,200 bucks?

Yeah.

Now, go home
and get some rest.

Do a little run
in the morning.

Here's the address
for tomorrow.

If we win, we go on.

If we lose...

You still up for it?

Yeah.

Good.

See you.

Sam, is that you?

Hi, honey.

Hey, Ma.

I made a lot of money tonight.

Oh, really?
Great.

That bar must be jumping, huh?

Yeah.

I'm gonna grab some sleep.
I'm really tired.

Good night.

Hey, how's that new girl
working out?

Oh, she's...

A lot of fun.
She's great.

Good.
Good night.

Night, honey.
Sweet dreams.

[grunts]

She's out.

[no audible dialogue]

Not a bad day
at the office.

I can't believe that call.

Good job, baby.

Nedish wants to see you.

Sure, I'll see you then.

You know what's gonna happen
if you're late, right?

Thank you.

Thanks. Bye-bye.

Mm.

Hey, baby.

Hello, Sam.
How are you?

It's nice to see you.
Hi.

Please take a seat.

Do you mind giving us
a few minutes, baby,

waiting in the car?

Excuse me?

Do you mind giving us
a couple minutes, please, Mona?

Wait in the car, please,

and I'll talk to you
in a minute or two, okay?

Please.


It's okay.

I'll see you in a minute.

It's okay.

I'll see you
in a minute, Mona.

Please, Sam.

Nice fight.

You were really, really good.

Thanks.

My pleasure.

Well, this may be
a little premature,

but I think you need
a new manager.

You think so?

Come on, Sam.

He's an old-time manager.
He's over the hill.

He will never, ever
get you into The Show,

where the real money is,

so yes, I think so.

I know you need the money.
Okay? I know that.

There isn't a girl
who gets in that ring

that doesn't need the money.

So just do me a favor
and think about it.

It's life-changing.

Okay?

Besides, I'm the one who
runs things around here, okay?

These opportunities will come,
and they will go.

Hey! Hey!

Hey, Nedish.

Look, I'll decide
if she's ready or not.

I think the lady can make
that decision for herself.

And right about now,
I believe I'm her best bet.

No, thanks.

Come on, Sam.

Wait a second.

The Show?

That's right.

We're not interested.

I can speak for myself.

Well, here you go, Sam.

Give me a call.

I'd like to hear from you.

Listen to me, cowboy.

I think it's time you went
and got yourself a new suit.

Okay?

I'll see you.

Here.

$500? That's it?

Tell me about The Show.

The Show?

You want to know
about The Show?

Do you understand what you're
getting yourself into?

This is a classic move.

This is what he does.

Okay? He uses people.

He takes
inexperienced fighters

to assure his fighters
a place in The Show.

She still would have
to beat me, though,

for a lot more money,

more money
than what you could get me.

He got to you.
I knew it.

I could smell it.

Look, Sam,

I am trying to build you
into a fighter, okay?

The fightings up till now
have been easy.

But come on.

I know you have some talent,
but Nedish?

Have you ever even been
to The Show?

You know what Nedish does?

Nedish creates wedges.

He fixes fights.

He does that for a living.

Hey, Sonny.

I'm sorry, man.

I'm sorry.

Is everything all right?

Yeah.

I've seen he and his brother
do it, okay?

And I don't trust him.

So just be patient.

I need the money.

We all need the money.

Hey, baby, what's your name?

Samantha Rogers.

Yeah, you're here.

Are you sure you're ready
for this?

Okay, why don't you pull
that car up

right over here for a minute?

Hey, guarrita.

I heard you been using my name.

Yo soy Cynthia Martinez.

[buzzer buzzes]

That's right, that's right.

We got a fight,
ladies and gentlemen.

In our tropical section is,
all the way from Cabrini-Green,

that's right, the C to the G
and the B to the B,

the one and only Boom Boom,

and all the way from Singapore,
the one and only Red Dragon.

[bell dings]

[people cheering]

[grunting]

Boom Boom!

Oh, and down goes
the Red Dragon!

Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
oh, my God.

She's out.

You know who she is.

She ain't getting up.
She ain't getting up.

Boom Boom.

Ladies and gentlemen.

Boom Boom.

Ladies and gentlemen,
she's undefeated,

the one and only B to the B,
Boom Boom.

Now, I want to thank everybody
for coming out tonight.

You ain't got to go home,

but y'all got to get
the time out of here.

We'll see y'all next week.

Thank you for coming, dog.

Hope you all enjoyed
everything tonight.

Thanks for clearing
the jungle, G.

[woman grunting]

You ready?

Hey, baby, how you feeling?
You good?

Mm-hmm.

Okay, go warm up.

Hey, Tony, how you doing?

Hey, Eddie.
Good to see you.

You look wonderful.
Take a seat.

Please take a seat.

Okay, it's all been
taken care of.

I just want you to know
that we can't lose, okay?

Mr. Loften's got
a lot riding on this.

Yeah, I'm sure he does.

He's eager to fill
that final spot.

Aren't we all, Tony?

Please remember
that I only deal

with cream-of-the-crop
girls here.

And you will be paid.

You'll be paid in full.

You want to know why?

Because I built this up, okay?

I built all of this up.

Besides, Sonny's girl has yet
to face any real competition.

I put my life on it.

We're gonna hold you
to that, Eddie.

Okay.

Enjoy that tequila, okay?

It costs a little more
than the suit you're wearing.

Please, relax.

I'll see you later, Tony.

Nice.

There you go, baby.

Nice.

Nice.

[bell dings]

[metallic rattling]

Hey.

Hey. Hey!

What are you, crazy?

Stay down.

[both grunting]

Please, let's do it, baby.
Come on.

Get out of that ring.

It's not your night.

This is no fight, TC.

If she hits you, stay down.

She's gonna kill you!

All right, all right!

All right!

All right, all right,
it's enough!

[chuckling]

One step at a time.

[coughs]

It's Sam, isn't it?

Yeah, doc.

Hi, Sam,
my name is Dr. Faber.

I'm gonna take a look at you,
if that's okay.

Can you stand up for me?

How's the ribs?

Yeah, let me check those ribs.

All right, sit back down, Sam.

That's it. Slow.

I need you to follow my finger.

Okay?

Don't move your head.

And back.

Sorry, it's bright.
I know.

I can't believe you let her
go in there like that.

What are you thinking?

I wasn't thinking clearly.

Obviously.

Get some rest.

I'm going home, Sonny.

[engine rumbling]

Oh, hi, honey.

I got some leftovers for you.

I'll go heat them up.

That'd be great.

Mila and I went
to the supermarket today.

She was signing,
and this lady came over to me.

She said to me,

"Oh, that girl
is so beautiful,"

and Mila just lit up.

You should have seen her.
She just lit up.

Here it is.

Samantha?

[phone ringing]

Hello.

Who is this?

Sonny Cool?

She's not here.

Samantha.

What is going on?

[sighs]

What's going on, Sam?

Ma, I've been
in these tournaments.

I've been making
really good money.

What do you mean,
tournaments?

Fighting tournaments.

You've been lying to us.

I had a chance,
and I took it.

How are you gonna help Mila
if Mila loses you?

I'm the only chance she has.
I'm all alone.

How dare you say that to me?

You're all alone?

I have been here helping you
every bit of the way.

Both of you.

Don't you dare give me that bit
about you're alone.

I love you
and I love her

more than anything
in the whole world.

You know what, Ma?
Don't worry about it.

It's all over.

Do whatever you have
to do, Samantha.

But don't you ever say to me
again that you're alone.

[water trickling]

Are you hungry?

No, thanks.

I'll grab something at work.

Here's your coffee.

Have a nice night.

Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, Ma.

You need to go
wash your hands, Mila.

Your dinner's getting cold.

Go ahead.

And then I read in the paper

there's gonna be
a big motion picture strike.

I don't understand it.

Well, what did
Mr. Santana say?

What they all say,

"We can't accommodate
your child's special needs."

It's just an excuse
not to spend the time and money.

You know,
I've been thinking, honey,

that maybe it wouldn't
be such a bad idea if we--

Ma.

I'm gonna put her to bed.

It was his favorite jacket,
you know.

I don't think he let
another girl wear it but you.


You know, I always meant
to give it to you.

Don't know why
it took so much time.

Here.

Thanks.

She's a lot like him, Sam.

I just wish that he was here
to see her.


He loved you so much.

You know that, don't you?

I know.

We got lucky with you.

Don't go anyplace.

Stay.


Hey, hey, hey!

Hey!

Sonny.

How did you find me?

Carrie at the bar.

Is this your daughter?

This is Mila,

and this is Ruth,
Mila's teacher.

She's beautiful.

Hello, Mila.

I'm Sonny.

Hello.

Mm.

How long has she been--

It's a rare case.

Mila was born
with a neurological abnormality.

She's deaf as well.

Her balance is affected.

It's complicated.

What's on your mind?

Well,
I just came here to talk.

I just don't think
it's a convenient time.

I'll call you.

Bye.

We're talking.

Okay.

Look, I don't have much time,
so here's the deal.

One of the fighters
who qualified

suffered from a concussion,
a sparring accident.

I did a little
wheeling and dealing

with Lilly and Refugio,

and I got you in
as the wild card,

her replacement.

We've got just under
two weeks to prepare

for the biggest
winner-take-all event:

The Show.

I don't know, Sonny.

I've got responsibilities.

This was a bad idea.

I shouldn't have come here.

I'll see you around.

What am I supposed to do?

I'm not getting any breaks.

You know I can't win.

Why did you even come?

She never knocked you down.

[crying]

Why don't you go?

I got beat up.

I got--

She never knocked you down.

Come on.

You can win.

Come on.

Say it.

I can win.

Sure, you can.

So what's the game plan?

How much have you heard?

Enough.

All right, get ready.

You want to box?

Come here, come here.
Here you go.

Oh, no.

Oh, no, not everybody.

Oh, no, oh, no,
they're on top of me.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

Here, come here.
Oh, no.

Okay, all right.

All right,
now, get out of here.

Leave.

I got to do some work.
You guys are great.

Leave these behind.
Leave these behind.

Hey, come here.

Hey, hey, hey.

Come here.

All right, you guys,
can come back.

But first,
give me that space, okay?

No, we're done.
I got to do some work. Okay?

Oh.
Yeah, go over there.

Go inside.

Okay?

Take care.

Superman, give me five.

Okay.


Be patient.

Nice day.

Was.

Al, I'd like you
to meet Samantha.

Sorry, Sonny.

I am not interested.

Come on, Al.

Can I have a word
with you alone?

Just for a second?

No.

You want me to come inside?

Yeah, come on in.
Come on in.

It's not a good idea.

Look,
this is different, okay?

This is not--
I said no!

And no means no.

Look, I loved her
as much as you did, okay?

Danielle was our ticket.

Xavier investigated
every angle on that accident.

There was nothing we could do.
It wasn't our fault.

But this girl can take us back
to The Show.

Give her two minutes.

The Show?

The Show.

Isn't this the girl
that got beat up by Mona?

She never knocked her down.

She didn't knock you out?

All right.

Let's see what you got.

Thanks.

Come on up.

Show me what you got.

Pick up the pinkie gloves.

That's for the girls.

Yeah.

No, oh, I'm sorry.

Yeah, go ahead,
put them on.

Put them on.
Put them on.

This will be good.

Whoa.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

I'm being a jerk.

Go ahead, go ahead.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

Really, no, no.

Go ahead,
pick them up.

Go ahead, put the gloves on,
all right?

Oh, prepare
to defend yourself.

I guess we started.

Oh.

All right, oh, all right.

Whoa, hey, hey.

Come on.

Whoa, keep your hands up.

Keep your--whoa!

Teach him, baby.
Teach him.

All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

Hey, come on.

Okay.

Good hands.

How much time do we have?

Just under two weeks.

Oh.

Well, at least you got
the entry fee, right?

That was something
I need to talk to you about.

Oh, it figures.

We're gonna need an angel.

both: Flame.

¶ Something ¶

What do you want, Al?

I need you to train
this fighter for The Show.

We got two weeks.

This is Samantha.
Come here, Samantha.

She needs some ring tricks.

You got them.

You're an idiot.

What did you do,
promise her

that you could make her
become a champion?

Hey, hey, hey.

I need some advice
from a champion

to make a champion,
all right?

Are you in?

That was a long time ago,

and I don't want to go down
that path again,

see some pretty young thing
like this

get her brains bashed in
like Danielle.

Hey, all right, fine, great!
Good-bye.

Thank you very much for coming.

Fine, thank you.
Have a nice life.

Sonny.

I should have known.

When you two get together,

you have these
harebrained scheme ideas.

Let her go, Sonny.

It's a good idea.

It's a good idea?

She can take us back
to The Show.

Come on.

For old times' sake.

We need you.

Yeah, come on.

Come on.

Yeah.

Oh.
Come here, baby.

Okay?
Yeah.

That's my girl.

Don't tire out on me.
Come on, baby.

There should be
a little more fury.

Roundhouse.

Nice.


Again, again.

Push me back.
Push me back.


Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

Come on, up, up, up,
up, up, up, up, up.

[both grunting]

[coughs]

I'm not interested
in champions of the ring.

I'm interested
in champions of the heart.

Sucker punching me
does not make you a champion.

No, but that's
the game in here,

and right now,
you'd be done.

There's no rules
in this ring.

You should listen to her.

There are a lot
of fighters out there

that really, really
want this,

and on the night of the fight,

when you're getting
your ass kicked

and you're seeing stars
and maybe angels,

I'm gonna ask you
one more time:

just how bad
do you want this?

Go, baby. Go.

Move back.
Roundhouse kick.

Back. Roundhouse.
Back. Roundhouse.

[no audible dialogue]

Come on,
that's all it takes.

[engine grinding]

How do you feel?

Okay.

Yeah?
Yeah.

How do I look?

You look real good.

[engine grinding]

[engine turns over]

Yeah!
Yeah!

Let's go.

Excellent.

Jab right.
Jab right.

High kick.

Okay, that's good.
That's good.

That's good for today.

How's your hand?

It hurts, right?

Get some ice on that thing,
okay?

You're doing good.

Good work. Thanks.

Thanks, Al.

Hey, Sonny,
meet you in the car.

I got to go get cleaned up.

Ten minutes.
Thanks.

Sammy, I'm so proud of you.

You know what?
You're doing a great job.

Just, you know,
stay focused,

and, uh,
go get some ice on that.

Okay?
Okay.

Good night, sweetie.

We're all here?

Good.

So we begin.

This is the richest pot
so far.

$250,000,

winner take all.

The winner also gets

15% of the total bet
on the final fight.

Gentlemen.

Oh, my God.

I can't believe my eyes.

Look who filed
for unemployment.

Nice to see you, Al.

May I continue, Nedish?

Sorry, Mr. Loften.
Absolutely.

Anyone who tries to fix
or manipulate any of the fights

will have to answer to me.

His fighter
will be disqualified,

escorted off the ground.

You will not be so lucky.

Any question?

Well, I suggest
the final contest

be an all-out
full-contact fight.

Anything goes.

Well, that's up to you,
everyone here.

We're in if the winner's share
is increased.

Sounds good to me.

More money, full-contact.

El puño limpio.

Apostamos.

Four years ago.

Have you forgotten?

Is it so long ago?

I believe
that was a fluke, Al.

A fluke?

She's a vegetable.

Come on, she's a vegetable?

People become
more than vegetables

in regular sanctioned fights.

Hey, don't talk to me
about boxing.

You've never been
in a ring in your life.

You double-crossed us.

Nobody stepped in to stop it.

She was almost beaten to death.

You know about this?

No.

What kind of people
are you?

It was obvious
she never should have been

in the ring
in the first place.

You know what?
You shouldn't be in this room.

Who'd you con
to get to this party, buddy?

The past is the past.

Now, what if I personally add
$250,000 to the pot,

bringing the total
to $1/2 million?

Anyone object now?

I do.

Then why don't you
pull your fighter, Al?

Why don't you shut up
and sit down?

I'm out of here.

You coming?

Come on.

Come on, let's go.

We're out. Good-bye.

Look, uh--
What?

Why don't you be reasonable?

Reasonable?

I'm out of here.

Al. Al!

You know what, Sonny?

Bottom line is,

she didn't deserve
to be here anyway.

She should be at home
taking care of her crippled kid,

as far as I'm concerned.

Come on, come on!

Come on!

[all shouting]

Pissant!

Let me show you
what bare knuckles is all about.

Enough!

Settle your personal dispute
elsewhere.

You.

Not in my house.

I'm okay.

Unless, of course,

you're wearing
a short pink skirt, lipstick,

have the superb
nichons, eh?

Alors, gentlemen,
it is settled.

$1/2 million, 15%.

I must leave you
to my beautiful wife.

All right, gentlemen.

Have a good evening.

We look forward
to seeing you at The Show.

And remember,
it is a black-tie event.

I got $200 against her.

You gonna take it or not?

Look out for my fighter.

Oh, hey.

Hey, Sonny.

You ever touch me again,
you ever come at me again,

and I'm gonna
make your life--

Hey! Hey!

Hey!

Excuse me, gentlemen.

Excuse me.
We have a problem here?

No, no problem.
I think this guy hurt himself.

Come on.

Get up.

Get off of me.

Okay, let's go.

Come on.

You okay?

No, I'm not okay.

Well, you look great.

Come on.


Hey.

Hey.

Al told me what happened.

It's unbelievable.

It was innocent.
It was fun.

It was feminine.

Now it's dirty
and competitive.

You know, I can get back
most of the entry fee.

And do what?

Well, now
that it's bare knuckles,

it's full-contact.

Anything goes.

I can see that.

Are you sure you want to--

More than ever.

[chuckles]

Enough of this, okay?

We got work to do.
Come on.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Okay, back to biz.

It's time to discuss
each one of the fighters,

since they're probably
discussing you right now.

How many fighters?

16 in all, counting you.

Means you'll have to win
four fights to win it all.

First, from South America,
there's Cindy Martinez--

the real Cindy Martinez.

She's a jabber.

She's also a local favorite.

It's rumored that her managers
made deals with the others.

Deals?

Yeah, some of the fighters
will agree to take a dive

if the money's good enough.

Raises the odds,
but don't count on the dive.

Then there's Kim Sue.

Kim Sue's real fast.

She's little, she's small,
but bam,

she can sweep your legs out
right from under you

and land a blowout punch.

Yeah, and she's
a really tricky one.

That's why you got
to stay on your toes

when you're fighting her.

And then there's
Trixie the Trickster.

Nah.

Yeah, you're right.

Then we have
our Romanian favorite, Nasha.

Strong, tall,

but she's not something
you can't handle.

I disagree.
She's a lot to handle.

She's a world-class swordsman.

Very unique style.

And there's Boom Boom.

Six feet tall, 140.

She can take a hit,
but she can deliver one.

She goes for the knockout
with each swing.

If she connects,
it's over.

They say she's related
to John Henry.

Then there's Mona.

Mona's a well-rounded,
tough fighter.

I don't think we have
to talk about her.

And the others?

Each fighter
has their own unique style.

You do what you do best:

adapt to each one
of those styles.

That'll make you a winner.

Look, each one of these girls
got their own tricks

and their own rhythm.

You bring your rhythm in,
your energy.

Change it up some.

Then you go in
for the kill.

We've all got
something for you.

It's from all of us.

It's beautiful.

Oh, Sam.
Hi, Mrs. Macintyre.

Hi, dear.
Come over.

Nice to see you.

Nice to see you.

Sam, do you know

that I was a young wife,
a young mother,

and a young war bride?

Oh, my.

My world turned over.

You know, we were the--
what did they call us?

The girls that could.

So no matter what happens,

you got to carry on.

Thanks, Mrs. Macintyre.

[both arguing in Russian]

Girls this way,
guys that way.

[both continue arguing
in Russian]

Hi.

Girls this way,
guys that way.

Good luck, babe.

Thanks.

Guys this way.

Oh, okay.
Yeah.

Uh, excuse me.

What did I just say?
Guys that way.


Merci. Thank you.

I am about
to introduce to you

16 of the meanest,
toughest,

and, I just might add,
sexiest

bare-knuckle fighters
from all over the world.

Let us welcome
our Pussycats.


FF1.

FF2.

FF3.

FF4.

FF5.

FF6.

FF7.

FF8.

FF9.

FF10.

FF11.

FF12.

FF13.

FF14.

FF15.

And finally, FF16.


Fighting will commence
at high noon.

And may the best fighter
win it all.

That's you.

[whispering indistinctly]

Whoo!

Hold on.
This is women only.

I need you to step out.

I'm a manager.

I guess this
is where I leave you.

Good luck.

You got to go.

Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

You should come over here

and pick out something
on the rack.

Oh, I brought my own.

That's not how
we do things here, sweetie.

Thinking too much.

Somebody's got to.
Ah, shh.

Are you kidding me?

You know those are mine.

Quit touching me,
you bitch!

What are you gonna do
about it?

Hey!

[all yelling]

[all cheering]

Behave yourselves.

[all cheering]

That's mine.

[triumphant music]

¶ ¶

Oh, yeah.

She's out.

She is out.

She's out.

Come on, come on, come on.

That's what I'm talking about.

She's out!

Finish her!
Finish her!

Get up.

She's out!

Congratulations
to you all thus far.

And the pairing is as follows.

FF4 will face FF3.

FF10 will face FF2.

FF7 will face FF13.

And FF5 will face FF1.

Thank you, and good luck.

Donald.

Why is it that my fighter

ends up with Nasha
this early in the pool?

Sonny, this is good
for you.

People here know

what all the fighters can do
except yours.

Look at the odds.
She's 15 to 1 already.

If she wins,
imagine the payout.

All right, I'll buy that.

Why is Nedish talking
with all the other managers?

Since when
is talking a crime?

When he's the one
doing the talking.

Sonny, you just make sure
your fighter is ready.

Have a little drink.
Make a little party.

I'll take care of everything.

Okay?

[bell dings]

Come on.

Pick it up.
Pick it up.

Don't let her back you up.

She's out!

Whoo!

Kicked your fighter's booty!

[bell dings]

Come on, Cindy.

She's out!

[both speaking Russian]

Let's get it on!

[bell dings]

[grunting]

Stay patient.

Stay patient.

She is out!

Hey, Sam.

Sonny, wait a minute.

Sonny, come on.

We had worse fights
when we was kids.

Listen.

If your girl keeps winning,

maybe we should talk
a little business.

What do you say?

I think
he's getting nervous.

No, I'm not nervous.

I'm just looking
to make a killing.

Aren't we all?

Come on, Sonny.
Getting nervous.

He's nervous.

All right, Sonny.
I'll be here.

Move it.

Good luck to you, Scuba.

Come on, get in there, babe.

Show them what you got.

[bell dings]

[screaming]

Let's get a win,
Boom Boom.

I got dinner reservations.

Let's go.
Let's see what you got.

Give it to her!

Yeah, all right!

Come on, girlie.

Come on, Boom Boom!

Work it!

Come on, Boom Boom!

Stay down.
Stay down.

She is out!

Boom, boom.

Looks like you'll make
those reservations, Scuba.

Well done, baby.
That's how we roll.

Thank you.

Okay, come on.

[speaking French]

Speak English.

Yes, sir, I promise you,

I promise I'll pay you
as soon as I can.

Is that right?

Yes.


My finger!

My finger!

Once again, you've turned this
into a fantastic event.

I know.

Nedish,
do you have a problem?

You're not happy
with the arrangement?

What? Not happy?

Well, no. Why?

A few of my guests
think you're fixing the fight

in your favor.

Well, no,
I spoke to a few managers

and simply told them

that if their girls
were to lose, not to worry.

I would carry their action.

Why would you do that?

Why?

Because I want their money.


I want their money, Donald.

You see, my offer
keeps them in the game,

and it fattens the pot.

Sonny thought some
of the fights were pushovers.

Sonny, Sonny, Sonny.

Let me tell you about Sonny.

He's nothing
but a two-bit hustler,

and at the end of the day,
Mona is the best.

Come tomorrow's fight night,

you're not gonna have
to worry about anybody else.

You seem pretty excited, huh?

I love to watch Mona work.

She has not yet won.

Well, when that time comes,

maybe we could have
a little wager.

We'll see.

We'll see.

Okay, I'll see you.

So what are your thoughts
on the purchase?

I don't think anyone
knows a thing.

It's the right time.

Don't make me angry.

No eye gouging,
no biting.

Now, back to your corners.

Jeff, good fight.

Good luck.

[bell dings]

Fight!

You want a piece of this, huh?

Get in there.

Let's go.

Come on.

[people cheering]

Oh, my--

Get out of there!

Get out of the corner!

Come on, you got her!

Yeah!

Keep your hands up.

Don't back off, now.

Get out of there!

Get out of that corner,
out!

Yeah!

Get up.

That's it.

She's out!

[bell dings]

Fight.

Come on, Mona.

I'm sorry,
was that your kidneys?

Let's dance.

Get her, Mona.

Watch it, Trixie.

Come on.

Whoo!

[light applause]

Get her. Get her.

Roadkill.

Nice.

She's out!

Come on out.
Get some rest.

Tex, listen to me.

Tomorrow's the final fight.

I want you to make
an announcement

that I will personally
take all action on Mona.

You got it?
Right, boss.

Take all action on Mona.

You got it.

Come here, baby.

It's beautiful.
Thank you.

Where's a towel?

Come on, Sam.

Sammy,
I need to talk to you.

Okay.

When Sonny first asked me
to take you on,

I wasn't sure
about your skills.

But now that I've
seen you fight,

I think you're our chance
to make a big score.

Sammy, we have
great confidence in you.

You're a wonderful fighter.

Tomorrow night,

you're gonna fight
the fight of your life.

Nedish is betting
everything he has against you.

I'm lost.

We've waited a long time
to get back at Nedish.

And we think we can
through you.

All right,
to make a long story short,

we'll cover tonight
with Xavier.

Very nice.

Now, when Nedish loses,

he's not gonna be able
to cover his debts,

so Loften's gonna have
to pick up all his markers,

and I assure you that that'll be
the last we see of Mr. Nedish.

And if I lose?

I'm dead.

Explain that.

Sammy,
you're not gonna lose.

Hey, baby.

You know, Loften thinks he's
gonna run this event forever.

But the truth is, these people
come to see you, baby,

not him but you.

Don't you worry.

If all goes well,

I'll be running The Show
real soon, baby.

Yeah, babe.
I just want you to be careful.

Loften's a powerful guy.

And you're right.

They do come to see me,

not him

and definitely
not you, Nedish.

Me.

Come here.

Don't you ever, ever
talk to me

like that again,
you understand me?

Don't you ever talk to me
like that.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

Yeah.

Okay, baby.
You're good.

Come here. Come here.

What's up, Nedish?

Hey, Scuba, how you doing?

Boom Boom.

Come on, let's go.

Boom Boom.

Good luck to you.

[engine rumbling]

And you're fast.

I'm the one who runs things
around here, okay?

These opportunities will come,
and they will go.

There are no rules in here.

[whispers indistinctly]

Today.

Time to wake up.

Yesterday.

Today.

Ma'am.

[no audible dialogue]

Ladies and gentlemen,

tonight is what we've all
been waiting for:

the final $500,000
winner-take-all,

no-limit,
full-contact fight

between two
of the toughest, sexiest

bare-knuckle fighters
in the world.

It is a beautiful evening
for violence.

The moon is shining.

Champagne flows freely.

Never forget the sacrifice

that these fighters
have made for all of us.

Make sure you bet freely.

Make sure you bet well.

And so let us begin.


Nedish, what's the odds?

I've told you not
to long shot your money, okay?

The odds.

If I was you, I'd get her
out of this racket, okay,

because she really
has a beautiful face.

I hope you can remember,
the last time they met,

it wasn't so pretty.

Rumor has it that your girl
still may have a few weaknesses.

4 to 1.

Okay, I got $250,000.

At 4 to 1,
that's 1 million bucks.

Can you cover the bet?

[laughs]

You?
You're kidding me, right?

Come on.

Oh, no, I can back it,
but your fighter can't.

Done.

Take the bet, Tex.

Yes, boss.

Thanks.

Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to The Show!


Please let me introduce,

from the wrong side
of the tracks,

Mayhem Mona.

[cheers and applause]

And her challenger
for this evening

is Samantha Rogers!


This will be
a three-round fight.

Hold your hats,
place your bets,

and let's get ready
to roll!

[cheers and applause]

Sam, you're here

because you're supposed
to be here.

You have the power,
and you got the grace,

which is a gift.

All right?


No eye gouging
and no biting.

Back to your corners.

Let's fight!

[bell dings]

There it is.
There it is.

That's it.

That's it!

Bring her into you.

Bring her into you.

[bell dings]

Time!


Good.

That was good.

Sam, it doesn't matter
how fast she is.

You're smarter.

Stay focused and in control,
okay?

Do me a favor.
Yeah?

Just put a little more
pressure on her.

I already did.

Put more.

More, more, baby.
She's dead.

She can't hurt me.
I don't feel her power.

Good to know, baby.
Good to know.

All right, don't let her
get to the third round.

Try and finish her
in the next round.

I don't plan on it.
I've got it.

Okay, baby, good.
I like it.

Okay.

[bell dings]

Fight!

Come on, Sam.

Yeah!
Come on!

Don't wait, Mona.

Don't wait!

One.

Suck it up.

Come on, Sam.
All that training.

Two.
How bad do you want it?

Three.

I'm gonna throw it in
if you don't stand up.

Stand up.

You can do this.
Suck it up.

You want it, Sammy.
Five.

I'm gonna call it.

Six.

[people chattering]

You got it.

[bell dings]

Time!

Time!

Get off!

Look, this is your time now,
all right?

Suck it up.
Think about it.

You get that pain
out of your head.

Nothing hurts.

You're a warrior.

This is round three,
your final round.

It's your time, okay, Mona?

How bad do you want this?
Look at me.

It's your time, baby.

We talked about this.

Everything
you learned before.

It's everything.

Come on.

[bell dings]


Fight!

Come on, Sam.

Come on.

Get out of the corner!

[people shouting]

Jab out.
Just get out there.

Jab out, baby.
Jab out!

Come on, baby.

Go! Go!

Jump down on her!

Come on, baby, come on!

Go! Go! Go!

Finish her!

Finish her!
Finish her!

Get off the ropes!

Get off the ropes!

Finish her!
Finish her!

One, two, three...

Come on, baby!

Four, five...

Come on, baby.

Six, seven,

eight, nine!

Out!

[cheers and applause]

And the winner of this year's
bare-knuckle championship,

Samantha.

[cheers and applause]

Ah, that's it!

Champ, the champ!

You just keep on trucking,
don't you?

Did something change?

Well, I was thinking--

I mean, I thought--

Today is time to wake up.

[vocalizing]

Yesterday.
