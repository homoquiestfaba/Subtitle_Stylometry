MALE NARRATOR: <i>It was
in all the papers at the time.</i>

<i>Men searching in the Arctic
had found a yellow metal.</i>

<i>A mad fever spread
as far as word can travel</i>

the North to try their luck.</i>

<i>These men needed dogs.</i>
(dogs barking)

<i>Big dogs with strong muscles
to pull their sleds.</i>


Good morning there, Buck!

MAN: Easy, boy.

All you have to do

is sit.


(Buck yelps)


This ain't
the Southland anymore.

Go on.

(growling softly)

See it.

See it, boy.

It's the law of the land now.

The law of club

Good.

Good.

You a fast learner.

MALE NARRATOR:
<i>Skagway, Alaska.</i>

<i>Gateway to the Yukon.</i>

<i>The edge of nowhere.</i>

<i>Most anyone looking for gold
went through here first.</i>

DOG SELLER: All right,
let's go, let's go.

There you go.

(indistinct chatter)

Get your caribou stew!
Right there.

MALE NARRATOR: <i>Buck was
a long way from home.</i>

(indistinct shouting)

Do you betray our Lord
for your lust of gold?

DOG SELLER: Don't mind them.
Come on.

No. This way. This way.

(Buck grunts)

Come on! Move.

There you go. Come on.
Come on.


Come on now, buddy.

It's just snow, Buck.
Come on.


(barks)
(dog seller grunts)

Hey! Buck, come on!

Get over here!

Buck!

All right.

That's it.

The house is hers?

and everything in it.

That's good.

She deserves it.

CAPTAIN: All aboard!

Not much luck up there
this last year.

Seems more folks coming back

pockets empty
than full of gold.

I'm not looking for gold.

(both grunt)
Hey! Jeez...


Watch yourself.

CAPTAIN: Last boat
to Dawson leaving now!

Miss it,
it's only sleds till spring.

Hey! Thanks.

MAN: Good morning.

DOG SELLER: Perrault!
Been a long time.

PERRAULT: Good to see you.

DOG SELLER:
How've you been?

Good, good.

DOG SELLER: So, telegraph
hasn't put the mail service

out of business yet?

PERRAULT: Not yet.

I need two dogs
for my team.


(all grunting)

(dog barks)

PERRAULT: You wanna go?

Don't wait for me!

(Perrault grunts)



PERRAULT: <i>Bonjour,</i> Francoise!

FRANCOISE:
What have you done now?

PERRAULT: This is Buck.

Two. We needed two.

What? He's big.

Too big.

He'll never make it.
PERRAULT: He'll make it.

What do you know? Aah.

Okay, let's you
meet the team.

Buck, meet Spitz.

Your new boss.
(sniffs)

Stay out of his way.


That's Dolly.

Pike.

Jo.
(barks)

Billie.

Dub.

(sneezes)
Dave.

And Sol-leks.

You are here.

Welcome to the team.

We have a new route,
so everyone pay attention.

(Dave barks)

You, too, Dave.
We are here.

We deliver mail 500 miles
all the way to here.

Dawson.

They don't understand you.

Buck, just do
what Spitz does. Okay?

He leads, you follow.


Team, ready?

Remember, we don't
just carry the mail,

we carry lives!

And, mush!
(dogs barking)

(both grunt)

Come on, mush!

(dogs yelp)
(Spitz barks)

<i>Allez!</i>

<i>Allez!</i>


(dogs yapping)

Spitz! Gee!


(Buck whimpers)

(Perrault yells)
FRANCOISE: Whoa! Whoa!

(dogs yapping)




See, Buck?

Now all our fates are one.

FRANCOISE: They're dogs!
They don't understand.

Oh, yes, he does.

Oh, yes.

Buck, we're all
tied up together now.

We fall all together,

but so do we get up as one.

Come. We try again.

Easy.

That's it, Spitz.


FRANCOISE: I think
your dog is broken.

PERRAULT: He's not broken.

He's just got
Californian feet.


(owl hooting)

MALE NARRATOR: <i>Out here,
under an open sky...</i>

<i>Buck felt a cold
he'd never known.</i>




FRANCOISE: Out!

Dogs sleep outside!

(wind whistling)
(whimpers)


MALE NARRATOR: <i>Growing up
in the world of man...</i>

<i>Buck had learned
to listen to their voices.</i>

<i>Tonight,</i>

<i>he would begin
to hear his own.</i>

(barks nervously)



PERRAULT: Come on, Buck!

We have to get on the day.
(yawns)

<i>Allez!</i>

(dogs barking)

PERRAULT: On by!

Mail!

Thanks, Perrault.

PERRAULT: Mail!
(grunts) Thank you!

(dog barks)

(Dolly whimpers)



PERRAULT: That's better!

(Perrault grunts)

You are a heavy one.

(Jo whining)

(Spitz barks)
(Jo whimpers)


(snarls, barks)

Spitz! Gee!

Yeah! That's a turn!

You see?
He learns quick.

MALE NARRATOR: <i>Doing
the work of a sled dog</i>

<i>brought Buck confidence
and joy.</i>

<i>Now, he belonged to a pack.</i>

PERRAULT: Gee!

Yeah, that's it!

<i>Fantastique!</i>

You're a real sled dog
now, Buck!


Hold up.

Buck, stay.



No, no, no! Francoise!


Francoise!


Francoise!

(Francoise coughing)
Francoise!

(Francoise gasping)
(Buck panting)

You okay?

(Buck yelps)
Buck!

Buck!

Save him! (gasping)

Buck!

Buck!

Buck!
(thud)

Buck!

Buck! (grunts)

(metal clatters)

(grunts with frustration)

Buck! (grunts)

Buck!


Buck.


(Buck panting)


Buck.

(praising in French)


Oh, Buck.

Oh, Buck.

FRANCOISE:
Crying for a dog.

PERRAULT: (scoffs) No.

No, no.
I wasn't crying.

You were crying.


No.

I wasn't.

(speaks French)

In all his years
hauling the mail...

Perrault has never
been on time.

Not once.

But he drives every day
like it might happen.

He believes.

But I never saw him
believe in anything

as much as
he believes in you.

Now I do, too.



(dogs barking)

(rabbit squeaks)



(all whimper)



(dogs whimper)

MALE NARRATOR: <i>A pack

(Spitz yelping)


(Spitz moans)

(all panting)

PERRAULT: Spitz!


Spitz!
(sneezes)

Spitz! Spitz!

(shouts in French)

It's not like him.

PERRAULT:
I looked all morning.

I can't find him anywhere.

(whimpers)
It's like he's vanished.

Spitz!

We have to go.
Without him.

Can't lose the day.

Sol-leks! Oh.
(Francoise gasps)

Buck? Back in place.

<i>Allez!</i>

Sol-leks has got
more than five years on you.

Get in line.

Ooh.

Buck.
(barks)

Just because you pull good
don't make you ready to lead.

Okay? <i>Allez.</i>


I don't think
he's gonna move.

Oh, he'll move.

Buck...

Move.

(Perrault and Francoise
grunting)

PERRAULT: Sol-leks, come.

Come.

<i>Allez!</i> (grunts)

Here.

(speaks French)

(yelps)
Hey. Come here.

Hey. (grunting)

What got into this dog
this morning?

No. Hey.

I think they know something
you don't know.

There's nothing I don't know.
(Sol-leks whining)

Hey. Where did he go? Hey!

We can't make up
this much time.

They'll close the office.

PERRAULT: No!

No!

No, no, no, no, no!

We were going
to be on time.

Just once!

(lashing out in French)

(yelling in French)

Fine.

Take it.


(Francoise pats Perrault)

FRANCOISE:
It's not that bad.

PERRAULT: I lost my lead dog.
(barks)

We'll be two days behind
if we're lucky.

And we've never been lucky.


FRANCOISE: You might wanna...

...hang on.
Yeah, yeah.

Okay, Buck.

And, mush!

Whoa!

(Perrault laughing)

Hey!
(continues laughing)

(barking)
Yeehaw!

(dogs panting)

Go, Buck!

Go!

Yeah!

(dog barks in distance)

(dogs barking)

Yes, Buck!

Go!

Yeehaw!

(gasps)
Haw!

Buck, haw!

Turn left!

Left!

Turn left!
(barks)

Go! Turn left!

No! No!

No, no, no!

Are you crazy?


PERRAULT: No, no, no! No!

(icicles clinking)


(Perrault yelling)

Go, go, go, go!

(Perrault yells)

Faster, Buck! Don't stop!


(Buck barking)

FEMALE POSTMASTER:
Perrault?

(Perrault yelling)

Yeah! (laughs)

This is it! This is it!

Don't let up now, Buck!

Yeah, that's it! Yeehaw!

(people gasping)
(gun fires)

Clear the way!

Move!

Go!


PERRAULT: Whoa!

BOTH: Whoa!

(dogs barking)

Did you see that?

(Perrault laughs)

We made it!
(bell tolling)

(shouts in French)

We did it!

(overlapping chatter)

WORKER 2: Laverne!

Doyle? Kennedy?

POSTMASTER: I've got

WORKER 2: Lynch.

See, Buck?

We don't carry mail.

We carry lives.

We carry hope.

We carry love.

We leave in the morning.
Let's get some rest.

POSTMASTER: O'Neil? Walsh?

(man laughs)
POSTMASTER: Gallagher?

Look.

MALE NARRATOR: <i>Dearest Sarah.</i>

<i>The soul seems to have
gone out of me now.</i>

<i>Each day</i>

<i>starts with the memory
of our dearest son.</i>

<i>Tim's approaching birthday</i>

<i>reminds me
of all that's been lost.</i>

<i>The warmth of our home...</i>


<i>...the adventures
our son dreamed of.</i>

<i>I wish I'd found the words
to express how I felt</i>

<i>before the silence became</i>

<i>unbearable.</i>

<i>And I left.</i>

<i>I search for a place...</i>

<i>I might feel some</i>

<i>peace.</i>

<i>Though I fear
I will never find it.</i>

(wind howling)

<i>Because I know
that as I am,</i>

<i>there may be no home
for me in this world.</i>


(all howling)

(dogs continue howling)


(people cheering in distance)
(bell tolling)

(cheering continues)

(dogs barking)

Don't leave. Don't leave!
PERRAULT: Mush!


(all cheering)


PERRAULT: No, no, no!

Whoa! (grunts)

(crowd exclaims)

Buck! What?

You got time for one
more before you leave?

You're late.

It's just that
it's my son's birthday.

And I need to send
this remembrance to my wife.

You should have come
when we were taking.

Took time
to find the words.

Oh.

You learn to read,
we won't need Perrault anymore.

You are lucky.

Buck is the boss.

(crowd laughs)
Anyone else?

Hey, Buck.
I remember you.

Thank you.

Thank you for stopping.
PERRAULT: Now we go!

Ready, Buck?

(barks)
And, mush!

(crowd cheering)
(dogs barking)

PERRAULT: Line up!

Yep!

Nice, Buck!

Yeah, that's it!

Straight ahead!

Yep!
(crowd cheering)

2,400 miles in 80 days?


Buck is gonna
sleep till fall.

Perrault! One for you.
Looks official.

What's the news
from down south?

Good work.

Perrault?

(dogs barking)

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.

You did nothing wrong.

You all done good.
(barking continues)

Okay?

I'm sorry, Buck.

They don't need me
and my sled anymore.

By summer,
the telegraph will reach here.

A new way
to send the mail.

It's your team now.

You still have
a mighty journey ahead.

(bids goodbye to dogs
in French)

(bids goodbye to Buck
in French)


MALE NARRATOR: <i>The ground
had shifted under him again.</i>

<i>Buck had lost another master.</i>

<i>Now he would have to be
the leader himself.</i>

<i>Until a new master
came along.</i>

(dogs barking)

(growls, barking)


HAL: I promised you, didn't I?
And here we are.

MERCEDES:
You promised me gold.

Where is it?
In the dogs?


HAL: Get the sled loaded.

It's time to
stake our claim.

Let's go.

And...

Mush!

(dogs barking)

HAL: Mush!

(crowd laughing)

Are they broken?

HAL: No. They're just lazy.

Buck?

HAL: Mush!

Charles,
persuade the beast.

MERCEDES: Not the club.

Charles!

Put that down or I'll...

I won't go a step!

Charles!
(Buck whimpers)

Remember me? (chuckles)

Yeah, I know.

Your runners are frozen.

You'll help your dogs
a mighty lot

if you take the gee pole
and break 'em out.

HAL: Gee pole?

MERCEDES: What is he doing?

Sir! Watch the Victrola.
(Mercedes gasps)

(crowd laughs)

Where are you
headed, mister?

It's none of your concern.

You didn't buy that map
in Skagway, did you?

No.
That old fairy tale.

Lost cabin.

(sled rattles)
(Mercedes gasps)

River of gold?

You're setting off
too far into the spring.

Half that trail
is on the river.

Well, that leaves
half the trail fit for travel.

Oh, it means the ice
is gonna break up

with your companions
and the dogs on it.

Why don't you lay over
till the spring thaw?

Save your dogs

and your companions
the suffering.

And let some old prospector
beat us to the gold?

I'm not a prospector.

No, thank you.

I paid a fortune
for this team.

They'll pull my sled.

They're good dogs, sir.
They'll pull your sled.

They'll pull your sled
till they die.

(slams on sled)

Thank you.

Let's go.

CHARLES: (taps on sled)
All right, let's go.

And...

Mush!

(dogs barking)

(crowd muttering)

CHARLES: You lazy mutts!

MERCEDES: I'm not so sure
about those dogs.

Maybe you should've bought
a different team.

CHARLES: Maybe
we should feed them.

We should've stayed
on the trail.

Mush!


(all gasping)

MERCEDES: Make it stop!

(Hal grunting)
(Mercedes screaming)


(Hal yelling frustratedly)


CHARLES: Maybe they need
a little encouragement.

(whip striking)

(dogs whimpering)
HAL: Mush!

(whip striking)
Mush!

MALE NARRATOR:
<i>For the first time,</i>

<i>Buck knew
more than his masters.</i>


HAL: Mush!
(whip cracks)

MALE NARRATOR: <i>But the whip</i>

<i>offered him no choice.</i>

(branches rustling)

(icicles smashing)


Son of a...

(dogs whimpering)

HAL: Well, now,

we're going across.

Move!

(Hal grunting)

(Buck whining)
(both barking)

I say you go.

Hal, he can't.

Move.

(Hal grunts)

(dogs barking)

Don't you dare.

Hey!
(Mercedes gasps)

(dog barks)

That river ice is gonna
break up any minute!

You fool!

That dog is trying
to help you keep your life!

MERCEDES: Hal!

(Mercedes gasps)

Why are you so keen
to stop us?

You know where
the gold is, don't you?


You keep your filthy hands
off of my dogs.

Hal.


(dogs barking)

Hal, he said
we shouldn't cross.

CHARLES: Hal, are you sure?
Maybe we just leave the dogs?

HAL: I know
what I'm doing.

Mush!


Mush!

(dogs panting heavily)

(Dub whimpers)

Don't do this.

Not to them.

HAL: Mush!

(birds chirping)


What am I gonna
do with you?




They're not here.

They're gone.

You've been sleeping
for two days

in my bed.

I'll be back.

(bottle clinks)


Stay. Go.

Do what you want.



(music playing)
(laughter and chatter)

Whiskey.

(muffled music playing)

(music continues)
(crowd chattering)

I want the bottle.

(door opens)

(grunting)
(people exclaiming)

They're all gone!

My dogs ran off.

My fortune lost.

You called it a fairy tale.


You didn't want me
finding the gold.

(Buck growls)

(Hal grunting)
(barking)

Easy, Buck, easy.

Buck.

Easy.
HAL: Well, you all saw.

This man and I
had business

and the dog went
for my throat.

Probably rabid.
(growls, barks)

(crowd gasps)

You leave
that dog alone!

Buck, settle!
(barking)

You see?

I say it gets put down
here and now.

MAN: No. Come on, mister.
You don't touch him!

MAN 2: No one puts
any creature down.

Until we hear
all the facts.

The man sucker punched me.

(people exclaiming)

(barking)
(Hal whimpers)

Buck, easy.

What might you have
on that belt, friend?


(people gasping
and exclaiming)

(Hal grunting)

MAN 3: No guns
on the premises!


(indistinct chatter)

You okay,
John Thornton?

Yeah.

I'm fine.


JOHN: What?

What are you
looking at, huh?

You got something to say?

(sets glass down)


Buck!

That's not very nice.

What did you do that for?

Hey, Buck!

Buck, what...?

Buck?

Bring that back.

Now what are you
gonna do, huh?

Buck? What are you doing?

Bring that back.

Buck, don't do this.

That's mine.

I need that.

Don't do this to me.

What'd you do?
Where is it?

Just, would you...


Get off.

Buck.

Darn, you're big.


This was his birthday.

My son.

After he died,
his mom and I...

...we just grew apart.

She didn't wanna
be around me...

I didn't wanna
be around anybody.

So, I came up here.

Then I met you.

(owl hooting)

Hell.

It's around here somewhere.
(object thuds)

Good, you're awake.

I put it...
(yawning)

Here it is.

Something I want
to show ya.

Come here.

This is a map
of the Yukon.

My son was always reading
adventure stories,

and he was crazy
about the news

coming out of the Yukon.

It wasn't the gold.
He didn't care about that.

It was the mountains.

He spent all day
looking at maps

and at pictures
of the mountains.

Dreaming about
what was on the other side.

Places no one had been.

Wild places.

"Let's go," I said.

He said, "Yeah, Pop."

We'd start there,

but then
he grabbed a pencil

and he drew a line
off the map

and he said,
"But let's go there.

"Off the map.
Where no one's been."

It's... It's a trip
he would've loved.

A real adventure.

We could go.

You and me.

See what's out there.

What do you think?

It's a canoe, Buck.
We're gonna ride in it.


Settle. Sit. Sit.
Sit, Buck.

Good. Good boy.

Ha. What are you doing?

Begging?

You're not my pet.

(thunder rumbling)

Are you comin'?

(Buck whimpers)

Get in here.

(birds squawking)


JOHN: <i>â™ª Row your boat â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gently down the stream â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Life is but a dream â™ª</i>

Come on, Buck.
Give us a song.


Maybe not.

(playing harmonica)

(plays random note)

(resumes playing)

(moose grunting)

(water rumbling)


(Buck grunts)

JOHN: Whoa!

(Buck barking)

Whoa! (grunts)


I'm glad you're enjoying this.


(John screams)

Oh, you like that, huh?

I guess
we walk from here.

(bird screeching)

(breathing heavily)

(objects clattering)

JOHN: Your ancestors
used to roam here.

And mine.

Back when we were wild.

(bird squawking in distance)

We come and go,
don't we?

This is always here.


What?

I don't know. Which way?
You tell me.

Go on. You lead.

(barking)
(John chuckling)


(Buck barking)
Buck?

(Buck barks)

Ah. Look what you found.

(Buck barking)

(John chuckles)

(door bangs)

Boy...

Look at this, Buck.
(barks)

I don't think
we're off all maps.


A prospector, I guess.

Trash.

Trash.
(grunting)

Trash.

(John exclaims)

Treasure.

(Buck grunts)

This is mine. All right?

Just leave it alone.
It's mine.


(John grunting)


(crickets chirping)

Good day.

(howling in distance)

It's your ancestors.

Wolves.

(wolves continue howling)

(water splashing)






That's good, Buck,

but more like this, huh?

Damn fairy tale's true.

That's more like it, Buck.

Attaboy!



What?
What you looking at?

Go take a look.

Go on.

Go on. (chuckles)

Just be back before dark!

(bear grunts)

(bear growling)



(Buck whimpers)

(wolf howling)

(harmonica playing)

(resumes playing harmonica)

Buck!






(wolves barking)



(Buck barks)



(wolf whimpers)

(log creaking)





(panting tiredly)

JOHN: <i>Here,
so far from home...</i>

<i>I can see a change
in Buck.</i>

<i>Something's pulling him
into the forest.</i>

<i>Into the hunt.</i>

(birds chirping)

That's beautiful, Buck.

Beautiful.

<i>He's still the same dog
with me,</i>

<i>but I find it hard
to imagine him</i>

<i>back in civilization.</i>

<i>Is there any house
big enough to hold him?</i>



<i>This journey seems to be
leading Buck to his destiny.</i>

<i>Where is it leading me?</i>

(bear growls)



Not this time.

Long after dark.

You've been staying out
later and later every day.

Yeah, I know,
there's a lot to explore

but world's
a dangerous place.

You never know
what's coming.


Fever took Timmy
in two days.

(grunts softly)

(chuckles softly)

Hell.

Okay, Buck.

(chuckles softly)

(John sighing)

(Buck grunts)

It's been
a beautiful summer.

You know what, Buck?

I've been thinking.

I might buy myself
a railroad.

Is that my hat?

That's my hat.
Come on.

Give me my hat.

Give me my hat.

Give me my hat.

Buck!

Buck!

Come on.

There you go.

Ooh.

Timber wolf.

Beautiful.

This is their domain.

They own these hills.

You wanna go?

Go.

Just...

...be careful.

(distant barking)

<i>He had been
both spoiled</i>

<i>and he'd suffered</i>

<i>at the hand of man.</i>

<i>Now, Buck found himself</i>

<i>with his own kind.</i>

<i>How far he has traveled
to find his home.</i>

<i>How far I have traveled
from mine.</i>

(John chuckling)

Here, look, Buck.

Groceries.

For life.

No man needs
more than that.

It's time for me
to go, Buck.

Go home.

Whatever's left of it.

Pick up the pieces,

or at least try.



No.

I'm not asking you
to come with me, Buck.

You got something here.

Something important.

Hang onto it.

I'm leaving
in the morning.

Come say bye.

You're a good dog, Buck.

You're a good dog.

(birds squawking)

(crickets chirping)

(soft rustling)


(gunshot echoes in distance)

(objects clattering)


(both grunting)

(gunshot)
(grunts)


You came
all the way out here.

You knew something,
didn't you?

Easy.

You wanted it
all for yourself.

Where is it?

Where's the gold?

It's everywhere.

Take it.

Take it all.

It won't change anything.

It won't
bring back the dead.


(growling)
(grunting)



HAL: Ah.

You know this, do you?

Good.
(whimpers)

You see it, boy?

You see it?

(whines)
Good.

(Buck growling)

(Hal grunting)

(John breathing laboriously)

(Buck whines)

Buck.

Yeah.

You came back.

(John sighs)

(breathing laboriously)

(Buck whining)

Wow, Buck.

(sucks teeth)

What an adventure, huh?


It's okay, boy.

(John breathing deeply)

You're home.

(birds chirping)

JOHN: <i>There is a place
in these mountains</i>

<i>where a new breed
of timber wolf roams...</i>

<i>wiser than man or wolf...</i>

(puppies barking)

<i>...because of the dog</i>

<i>that runs at the head
of the pack.</i>

<i>Now they live
without fear,</i>

<i>raise their young,
and flourish.</i>





(puppies barking)

<i>Some say
it's just a legend.</i>

<i>Not so.</i>

<i>You see,
I knew him once</i>

<i>when he was just a dog
at a man's side.</i>

<i>And even though
this land is his,</i>

<i>every summer</i>

<i>when he comes down
to the valley,</i>

<i>he remembers kind hands</i>

<i>and old masters.</i>

<i>Before he went
to his own,</i>

<i>became his own master.</i>

<i>Before he heard</i>

<i>the call.</i>
