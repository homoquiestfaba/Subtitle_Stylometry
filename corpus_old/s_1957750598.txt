[distant footsteps]

[birds twittering]

Lainey!

[door opens]

Lainey!


Where have you been?

I told you I need to
see you at all times.

Do you understand me?

Yes.

Mama, I got you an apple.

It's a good one.

Come on, get inside.

[heavy footsteps]

[birds chirping]

[door closes]

I told you not to unlock this.

Didn't you hear me?

I have to pack up, and I don't
want you running around

out there all by yourself.

And stop getting apples.

We don't need 'em.

He can join
his friends in there.

[Mason crying]

Mommy, it was for you.

Eat it.

[Jessica sighs]

Fine.


This one?
No.

Are you kidding me?

Okay.

[Mason cries]

[Jessica sighs]
[Lainey] I'll get the baby.

No, Lainey. I got him.

You know the rules.

[Mason crying continues]

[garbage can opens]

[door closes]

Please move your bike.

I can't get to the refrigerator.

can I make the bottle?

I'll... I'll make his bottle.

[Mason hiccupping]

Yeah, I'll be right there.

[heavy footsteps]

[into phone] Yes, ma'am.

Mm-hm.

Yes, ma'am.

[heavy footsteps]

Well, I'm gonna take off tonight

so the kids can sleep
most of the way.

[Mason cooing]

Well, I'm mostly done.

I just need to finish

cleaning out the pantry
and pack up the rest of the car.

[baby wipes rustling]

Everything else is clean.
[Mason cooing]

[JessicYes, ma'am.
I... I did. Yes, ma'am.

Well, I already started
looking for job postings

so it won't be long before
I could start paying rent.

We really, really
appreciate the help.

[Mason coughing]

Mommy?

[Mason crying]

no chance of that happening.


Well, I'm clean since rehab,
I told you.

Hush, baby!

I'm on the phone
to Auntie Claire.

Do you want me to take a test?

[phone beeps]

Okay,
I just used my last minute,

so I will take a test
if that's what you need.

[sighing deeply]

Okay, mmm.

[cellphone cover closes]


[window clattering]

Mommy, please.

[window creaking]

[heavy footsteps]

[Jessica grunting]
[Lainey] Mommy?

What?! What do you need?
What do you need?


Okay. Come on. Come on.
Go to the bathroom.

Let's go.
Come on.

[water running]

[Jessica exhales]

â™ª A-B-C-D-E-F-G â™ª

â™ª H-I-J-K-L-L-N-O-P â™ª

It's L-M-N-O-P, Lainey. Okay?

Are you almost done?

No.

Well, can you hurry up, please?

As much fun as it is
to wipe your butt,

I've got other things to do.

Keep practicing those ABCs.

You almost got 'em perfect.

[water dripping]

[Jessica sighs]

It's still leakin'.

Fuck!

That's a bad word.

[Jessica sighing deeply]

You're right.

I'm sorry.

Nana says
that's the baddest word.

Well, Nana's dead.

I'm done.

[heavy metal music blaring]


It'll be enough to get us here.

[clears throat]



Daddy's dead like Nana.

[heavy metal continues blaring]

[Jessica sighing]

No, baby.

Daddy is not dead.

Nana said he's bad.


[toys clattering]
[sighing deeply]

Daddy's not bad. Okay?

He's not bad.
He's just, he's just sick.

Just like Mama was sick.

Mommy's not bad.

[Mason cooing]

But I got better
'cause I love my little monkeys

too much to stay sick.

I'm not a monkey!
I'm a girl!

No, you are
a laughing little monkey

[imitates monkey]

From the Planet Monkopolis!

[imitates monkey]
[Lainey giggles]

[Mason crying]

[Jessica sighing deeply]

[tricycle clanking]

[Lainey humming]

What's that?


We'll eat it during the trip.

I got animal crackers in here.

I don't want to leave
Nana's house.

Well, there's
no jobs around here,

and I don't have any money
for taxes or anything else.

sell apples for money!

The apples are rotten, Laine.

[birds chirping]

[pantry door slams shut]
Oh, shit.

[pounding on door]

Lainey!

[continues pounding]

Lainey! Come here!

[tricycle squeaking]

Where are my apples, Mommy?

Lainey, listen.

I need you to open the door.

Okay. You just turn
that little latch real hard.

And it's rusted a little bit,
so you need to use your muscles.

where are my apples?

They're bad, Laine.
Please just open the door.

Did you throw them outside?

we can pick more apples. Okay?

But Mommy needs your help.
Can you help me?

[door jiggles]

It's hard to turn.

Make sure
it's going the right way.

[door jiggles]



They're bad, Laine.
They're not worth savin'.


Okay. Stand back.

[pounding loudly]

[brick thuds]

[continues pounding]



[exhaling helplessly]

Lainey?

Lainey, are you there?


Unlock the front door and
go to the red box on the porch.

Open it up,

and bring me a long metal tool.

One that has kind of
a little X on the end.


Yes.
Just bring me what you can.

The red box on the porch.

Bring me anything
from inside of it.

Okay, baby?
[Lainey] Okay.

[receding footsteps]

[hinges squeak]

[Jessica sighs]

[running footsteps]


[screwdriver thuds]


Now try to get one
just like this with an X, okay?


[receding footsteps]

[screwdriver
pushing and scraping]

[tricycle squeaks]

Lainey?
Did you find the tool?


Who's here?

He took the red box.

Is the front door locked
like I told you?


[cellphone cover shuts]

Lainey, go outside and get him.

Run!

[door squeaks open]

Got yourself
locked in here again, Jess.

Why am I not surprised?


This is yours.

Hm. Thanks.

[door slams]
[yells]

I'm just kidding.

I'm just kidding.

Come on.
Calm down, Jess.

Hey.
[door closes]

[Rob clears throat]

You're hanging out with Sammy?

I needed a place to stay.

You could have stayed here
if you passed a drug test.

You know that.

Hey, small fry.
You're so pretty.

How old are you?

Lainey.
[Lainey] I'm not a fry.

I'm a girl.
[Jessica] Lainey, come here.

Come here, baby.

Come on.
Let's go to the kitchen.

Just go finish your sandwich.
Okay, baby?


Oh, you tracked dirt

all over the floor, damn it.


[Sammy clears throat]

Where's the...
Where's the little guy?

He's upstairs
takin' a nap before the trip.

I don't wanna wake him.

So, Texas, huh?

Can't afford to stay here.

Can't afford it.

Too expensive.

Your grandma
didn't leave anythin'?


Like... like money?

No, no.
Just the house.

Look, you're both high.

So you should go.

No, I think this is good for us.

I'm glad you asked me in.


This is a chance to talk.

Talk about what?

I figured out our problem, Jess.

You think
you're too good for me.

No, no, I don't. I don't.

I just got help.

You can too.
You know, we have kids.

You brought Sammy here.

You know what he did
to that little girl.

You're always paranoid
about that stuff.

It's called projection.

What did I do, Jessica?

Nothing.
I was talking to Rob.

What did I do? Say it.

I was talking to Rob, okay.
I don't know.


Tell me what I did.

Go ahead.
Tell me what I did.

What'd I do?

What'd I do?
I wasn't talking to you.

I was talking to Rob.

Look, I've a lot to do, okay?

So thank you for getting me out,

and I'll call you
when we get there, okay?

Oh, she's so busy, Rob.

She's so busy.

I think you've just been
dismissed, buddy.

Yeah, I-I'm tired of getting

dismissed by you.
You know that?

I mean... I mean,
these are my kids too.


[punch thrown]
[Jessica gasps]

[Jessica cries]

[Sammy snickers]

You haven't changed.
[stick thuds]

You're still weak and needy.

What would have happened to you
if I hadn't gotten you

out of that pantry, huh?

Out here in the boondocks,
miles from the nearest neighbor?

You're right. I'm sorry.



You're a liar.

She's not sorry.
She's a liar.

She's lying.

Yeah, you just pretend
I wasn't here, Jess.

I'll tell you what,
you don't have to pretend.

I'll put things back the way
they were before I got here.

Rob! Stop!


Rob! Stop! Stop!
[Sammy laughs]

[Rob] Come here.
Rob, let me go.

[Rob grunting]

[Jessica] Rob! [indistinct]
[Rob] Come here.

Rob. Rob!

This is you without me.

Rob!
[thud as Jessica falls]

saving your silly ass!

[Jessica] No!
[door slams loudly]

[Rob talking indistinct]
Rob!

Let me out.

[pounds the door]

Rob, what are you doing?

[SammYou are learning.

Mommy, are you in there?

Lainey,
go upstairs to my bedroom

and lock the door.

It's the little button
on the door, you turn it.

Do you understand?


Just go. Now!

Go now!

[receding footsteps]

[Mason crying in distance]

Good girl.

Rob.

Please let me out.

Please.

[loud clattering]


What are you doing?

[loud thud]
[Jessica crying]

[hammering on door]
[Jessica screaming in pain]

Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

You put a nail through my hand,

you asshole!

[hammering]
[grunting in pain]

[RoHere's the deal, Jess.


time in there to think.

[hammering continues]

You've gotten
a little too full of yourself.

[hammering continues]

Rob, you're high.

You're not thinking straight.

[Sammy] Rob. Rob.
Don't do this.

[hammering continues]

Should I grab the kids? Huh?

We can bring them to my place.

Let's move.
[Jessica sobbing]

Don't you touch my kids,
you asshole!

Rob, he's a child molester!

Lainey! Lock the door!

Turn the button!

[tense music]

Rob, please don't let him
touch our kids.

Please leave them. Please.


It's pharmaceutical grade.

I'll come back when you're back
to your old self.

Rob!
Don't... don't take the kids.

Please leave them.

Rob?
[door slams shut]

Lainey?

Lainey, are you there?

Mommy loves you.


Rob.

[car door closes]

[car engine revving]

Rob!


[thunder rumbles]

[emotional music]


[approaching footsteps]

[door latch clicks]

[approaching footsteps]

Lainey?

[approaching footsteps]

Lainey?

Lainey, is that you?

Are you here?

[running footsteps]

why are you in there?

I got stuck again.

Lainey, where's Mason?
Is he okay?


I pushed the button on the door
and sang the ABCs to him

until he falled asleep.

You did a good job, Laine.

[breaths deeply]

Okay, Lainey.
Listen very carefully.

I need you
to go lock the front door.

You already know
how to unlock it.

You just turn that little
metal thing the other way.


[receding footsteps]

[door latch clicks]

[running footsteps]

[approaching footsteps]

I turned the lock.

You're a smart girl, Laine.

Okay.

Now, what did Daddy
do to the door?

Can you tell me what you see?

It's broken.

I know, baby.
But what...

What did he nail over it?


The two-by-fours. Crap.

Um, [clicks tongue]

Okay, Lainey, listen.

My purse... no, not my purse.

My cell...
My cell phone is on the floor

in the livin' room.

I need you to go get it
and bring it here.

Mommy, please come out.

I need to call 9-1-1.
Just go get my phone.


Just get the phone, please.

[receding footsteps]


[wind rattling and whooshing]

Are you sure
you looked everywhere?

It was on the floor.

Mommy, I can't find it.

And my purse is gone too?
Are you sure?



Dammit.

I have to pee.

You need to come with me.

[breathing deeply]

[Mason crying in the distance]

[wind whooshing]

Lainey, listen.

It's time for Mason's bottle.

There's one in the fridge.

And he needs his
diaper changed too,

and Mommy can't help him.


Then go pee!
I can't go with you.

I'm stuck in the pantry!


I want Nana.

I'm sorry, baby.

I'm sorry.

Mommy wasn't nice.

I miss Nana too.

But we have to take care
of each other now.

Okay?

[urine dripping]

Please don't get mad.

[emotional music]


[sighing deeply]

[approaching footsteps]

Mommy, Mason pooped.


He waited till now?

[sighing deeply]

Okay, Lainey, you remember
how Mommy does it?

You take the wipes
from the diaper bag.

Use those to clean him.

And then throw those away
with the diaper

and wash your hands after.

You got it?


[receding footsteps]

He's heavy, okay?
He's not a doll.


[emotional music continues]

[jar lid thuds]

[thunder rumbles]

[â™ª]

Mommy, I'm hungry.

[paper plate slides in]
[Lainey] I finished it.

to feed Mason now, okay?

There's a plastic spoon
in the diaper bag.

Use that to feed the baby.

And make sure you sit him up.

Okay?

hungry and I'm thirsty.

You can drink water
from the sink.

Just use the cup there.

I want juice.

Well, I packed up all our food

and juice box is in the car.

We need the keys
and they're in my purse.

And you shouldn't be drinking
juice all the time anyway.

It's bad for you.


Drink water!

[footsteps going up the stairs]

Don't let him choke.

Sit him up.
Do you hear me?

[exhales softly]

Mommy, mommy, wake up.

It's time for bed, Laine.

No, no.
Please come out. I'm scared.

I can't get out, baby.

You know that.

Or else I'd come tuck you in.


You just need to try harder.

I'm tryin' my best.

A monster's gonna grab me.

There's no monsters, Laine.

It's in the dark.

Mason needs you.

He's all alone.

I wanna stay here with you.

It's cold down here.

The heat's on upstairs.

Just shove a towel under
the window where it won't shut.

And put on socks.
I'm not cold.

It's just for one night.

I'll be out tomorrow.

Daddy will come back.


Just go to bed, baby.

Okay?

Go on.

[clattering and clanking]

[tricycle rattling]


Good girl.

Okay, time to feed Mason.

[jar thuds]

Be careful, okay?

Here you go.

[tricycle thumping away]
[incidental music]

Dammit.

[grunting softly]


Lainey?


When the baby falls asleep,
I need your help!


Here you go.
[small branch slides]

That won't work, Laine.

I need somethin' metal.

A tool, so I can chip away
at the wood.



[tricycle squeaking]

[pebble thuds]

[toy car thuds]

[plastic fork thuds]
and crayon thuds]

Mommy can't break through a wall

with a green crayon, Laine.

You know that.

I need somethin' hard.

I need somethin' metal.

I told you that already!

[Lainey cries loudly]

[Jessica sighing deeply]

[Lainey cries loudly]

[Lainey continues crying]

I'm sorry, Lainey.

I'm sorry for yellin' at you.

You're doing the best job.
You really are.

[breaths deeply]


I'm a bad mom, okay?

I just didn't know how to do it.
I never learned.

[sighing deeply]
And you don't know this,

but I was just too young
when you came around

and I wasn't ready for all this.

alone for so long

when I was sick.

I messed up real bad.

But I'm tryin'.


Just promise me
that you're not gonna grow up

and hate me like I hated my mom.




[door latch clicks]
[hinges squeak]

Lainey?

[wind whooshing]

Lainey, are you here?

Laine?


Who's here, Laine?

Answer me.

[approaching footsteps]

[screwdriver thudding]

I found it under the leaves.

It's Daddy's tool.

He lost it.

Good job, baby.
You did it.

This is exactly what I needed.


You are a good girl, Laine.

I love you.

take care of Mason.

[receding footsteps]


I'm gonna get out of here.

Just sit tight!

[hitting on tiles]

[incidental music]

[brick thuds]


Lainey, you there?

I'm almost done.

Maybe a few more hours
I can crawl out under the house.

[distant footsteps]

What's going on up there?


[loud thump]
[Mason crying]

Lainey, what happened?

[approaching footsteps]


Oh, god. Oh, god.
[Mason crying]

crawl down the stairs.

It's okay, it's okay.
[Lainey] Mommy, I'm sorry.

It's okay. It's okay.

You need to pick him up and
hold him until he stops cryin'.

He's alone
and he's scared right now.

but it's all gone.

You need to make him a bottle.

You remember how Mommy does it.

It's three scoops of formula,
the powder in the can.

You fill it up with water,
put the nipple on tight,

and shake it.


You can do it.

[Mason crying continues]


[Jessica grunting hard]

[thudding and clattering]

Lainey,

almost there.

I can do this.

It's gonna be fine.

Laine?

[tricycle squeaking]


Who's here?

Is it Daddy?

he called me a fry.

Okay.

Lainey, please tell me
you locked the front door.



Hello?

Anybody home?

Lainey,
run upstairs to the bedroom

and lock the door.

He's bad, Laine. Run!

[tricycle squeaks away]

[receding footsteps]

[door closes]

[wind whooshing]

[door closes]


Anybody home?

Little girl?

[measured footsteps]

[nervous breaths]

[approaching footsteps]

[hinges squeak]

[SammJessica?

Where's Rob?

[Sammy scoffs]

Is he with you?


So I thought I'd come
and babysit for you.

We don't need a babysitter.

I'm fine.


Please leave my house.

like to dismiss people,

don't you, Jessica?

You know.

Your daughter.


Very pretty.

Where is she?

She upstairs?

Rob's gonna be pretty pissed at
you if you mess with his kids.

Is that where she is?
Stay away from them.


And I'm here to collect payment,
Jessica.

[Jessica gasping]

No, no, stop!

Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

[Sammy] Little girl?
[Jessica sighing in distress]

[Jessica sobbing]


Where are you?

[climbing footsteps]

Where are you, little girl?

I have Rob's meth!

[footsteps halt]

It's yours.
I haven't used it.

I got probably
three grams down here.

Come on.
Don't let it go to waste.

Rob's just gonna take it back.

[approaching footsteps]


and he owes me money?

Yeah. And it's
all yours if you want it.

It's all yours.


Send it under the door.

Go ahead.
[Jessica] Let me out.

And it's all yours.



No can do, Jessica. No.

I don't get involved
in domestic disputes.

Well, call the police.

Or let me
use your phone, please.

Not calling the police.

Not getting you out.

Send it under the door, Jessica.

If I give you the meth,
will you leave us alone?

You have to leave the house,
and you can't come back.


I'll go. I'll leave.

You have my word.

Put it under the door.

[Jessica whimpers]

[â™ª]

[SammJessica?

Push it under the door, Jessica.

Jessica?
Sorry. Sorry.

I just... I'm injured.

I'm... I'm too weak
to get close enough.

Reach under the door
and I'll drop it in your hand.

You sound fine to me, Jessica.

Just push it under the door.

I can't reach that far.

Jessica.

over here on the other end.

I can't move much.

Have you tried it yet?

Rob said it's good stuff.

If you can't decide,

I'm gonna dump it out.


[Jessica breathes heavily]

[Sammy grunts]

Okay.

Where is it?

Can you reach my hand?

Almost.

Just... just can you stretch out
a little bit more?

[Sammy groans]

Okay.

That's as far as I can go.

Can you reach my hand?

I can just reach you.

Okay, drop it in my hand.

Here it comes.

[Sammy screams in pain]

Take it out!
Take it out!

[Jessica screams]

What did you do?

[Jessica pounding loudly]


Take it out!

Take it out, you bitch!

What did you do to me?

Get it out of my hand.

I swear. I'm getting out...

when I get out.

Keep your other hand out of here
or I will cut it off!

I'm gonna gut your kids
in front of you. you whore.

Get it out of my hand.

Get it out of my hand,
you bitch!

Get it out!

What did you do?

Get it out.
Get it out!

Get it out now!


Please, okay.

Get it out now!

Get it out! Get it out!

What are you doing in there?

It smells like liquor.

Wow.

[inhales deeply]

All liquored up.

You little bitch.

Take it out!



Jessica, please.

It's cold.

I'm freezing.

There's a storm coming in.

I saw it on the news.
It's gonna be freezing.

Please.

I get cold... I get cold easy.

I don't like the cold.

Please.
You left my front door open.

I hope you freeze to death.


What did you say?

You hope I freeze to death?

Oh, you hope I freeze to death.

you freeze to death.

I hope you freeze to death.


Hope? You hope I freeze to
death? You're an idiot.

People who use hope
are desperate, Jessica.

They're desperate people,
weak people.

Shut up.

I heard you went through rehab,
Jessica.

Oh yeah, Rob told me,
he told me all about it.

Oh yeah, Jessica,
she went through rehab.

Did they teach you
hope in rehab?

That's what they taught you?
They taught you to hope?

Right after they took
all of your money.

Oh yeah. I know that routine,
Jessica.

I went through rehab.
Oh, yeah.

I was clean and sober
for a long time, Jessica.

I got a job.
I took college courses.

I even filed a tax return.

And then after my mother died.

I realized that no one
in the whole world

gave a shit about me anymore.

That's what they didn't
teach me in rehab.

They didn't tell me
when I got sober

that I would go back
to the same miserable life

I used drugs to get away from.

Jessica?

You still got the three grams
in there with you?

Yes.

You ain't
gonna last long, Jessica.

Stop talking to me.

[Sammy] You know it. I know it.
Stop talking to me.

[Sammy laughs]

You know something?

I can smell weakness from here.
I can smell it.

The stink of weakness.

[Jessica cries]


We understand.

I don't molest little girls.

I hate you,
and I hate everyone like you.

How many people do you know
like me, Jessica?

Did somebody touch you,

when you were a little girl?

Put their hands on you, Jessica,
when you were a little girl.

[continues indistinctly]
[Jessica] Stop talking to me.

Stop talking to me.
Stop talking to me.

I said stop talking!

[Sammy screams in pain]

[Sammy groans]

[Jessica sobbing]

[thunder rumbles]


Please.

I'm freezing here.

I'm cold. I'm cold.

[Jessica shivering]


[thunder rumbles]
[light flickers]


Jessica?

I'm getting out.

You're gonna scratch your way
out like a little mouse?

You know, what? I wasn't gonna
hurt you or your kids.

Yeah, right.


I'm not a bad guy.

You're a monster.

[thunder rumbles]

Oh.

Dammit.

you dumb bitch.

[small footsteps]

[Jessica] Lainey?
[Lainey] Mommy?


Lainey, stay upstairs.

Do not come down here.

Lainey, run!
Run away!

[Lainey screams]

[Sammy] I got her. I got her.
[Lainey screams]


Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!

Hold on. I can't see.

[Lainey crying loudly]

[liquid splashing]

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

[thunder rumbling]
[strikes a match]

[Lainey crying loudly]


I've got your daughter.
Pull it out, now.

Pull it out, now.

Pull it out!

[screaming in pain]
[Lainey screaming]

Run, Lainey! Run!

Get away from him!

What did you do?

Lainey, run!

Lainey!
Put it out. Put it out! Now!

Put it out! Ah!

Put it out!
Put it out!

Put it out, please.

Please. Please. Please. Please.

[grunting in pain] Jessica.

Put it out!
Put it out!

[wind whooshing]
[faint rustling]


[wind continues howling]

[rain drizzling]

Lainey?

Let me know you're okay.

Put a blanket on the baby.

[rain drizzling]

[â™ª]

[paper tears]

[thunder rumbling]


[emotional music]

What the.

[pages rustling]

[sobbing softly]

Watch out for false prophets.

They come to you
in sheep's clothing,

but inwardly
they are ferocious wolves.

By their fruit,
you will recognize them.

Do people pick grapes from
thorn bushes

or figs from thistles?

Likewise, every good tree
bears good fruit,

but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

A good tree cannot bear
bad fruit,

and a bad tree
cannot bear good fruit.

Every tree
that does not bear good fruit

is cut down
and thrown into the fire.

Thus by their fruit
you will recognize them.


[crying continues]


Nana.





What good is this to me now?

Lainey?

Mason, I'm coming.

[door lock rattles]


Lainey, I'm out of
the pantry now.

Come let me in!


[door opens]

[rain falling]

[intense music]

Mommy, Mommy.


Oh, Mama's here.

I'm gonna look at you.

Let me look at you.

Mama's here, Mason.

Come here, Mason. Mommy's here.

Hello, Mason.
[Mason coos]

You did a good job.

You did such a good job, baby.

Thank you. Thank you.

You did so good.

Mama, I'm hungry.

Can I have animal crackers now?

They're in the car, remember?

[pouring raining]
[door hinges squeaking]

[suspenseful music]

[rain pattering]

You gotta hold Mason, okay?

Good girl, good girl.

Thank you. Keep him warm.


[suspenseful music]

[rain falling wildly]

[helmet thuds]

Mommy, I'm hungry.

[rain falling wildly]

[thunder rumbles]

Momma, I want to go back inside.

Come on. Come here.

[door rattling]


Hold your brother.

Hold him tight, baby.
Hold your brother, hold him.

[car window glass shatters]

Come on. Come on. Let's go.

[thunder rumbles]


Leave it. Leave it. Leave it.

Come on, Lainey. Let's go.

The storm's getting dangerous.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

[thunder rumbles
in the distance]

[Jessica sighs]

animal crackers now?

[Jessica sighs deeply]

[raining heavily]

Okay.
Let me go get them.

Okay, here.

You take Mason, okay?

You got him?

Hold him tight.

Keep him warm, baby.

Okay.

[Mason cooing]

[Jessica gasps]

[thunder rumbles ominously]

[dramatic music]


[intense music]

Lainey?

[banging on door]

Lainey, let me in!

[glass shattering]

[door opens then closes]

Lainey?

Lainey!

[Mason crying]

Lainey!

Lainey!

[Mason crying]

Lainey!


Sit down!

No, no, no, no!

Let them go.


Stop crying.

Mommy's here!

Let them go, please.

Please, please, please, please.

Please let them go!

I said please twelve times,
Jessica!

Remember? Please, please!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[Jessica] Let them go!
You want... you want Mommy?

You want Mommy?

Mommy, I wanna go.

Ssshh. Just sit tight.
Look what you did to my hand!

[Mason crying]


Stand there! Don't move!
Don't move!

The meth is still in
the pantry downstairs.

You can have it, okay?

You can have it.
Just go take it.

Yeah?

There's money in there too.

There's money,
there's like thousands,

there's a lot of money
from my grandmother.

You can have it, okay?
Yeah? There's money in there?

Just. just give me the baby.

I'm gonna cut your babies.

Stop! Stop!

Let them go.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

Please just... please stop!

Please let them go.


[Jessica] Let them go!
Move again, and I'll cut him.

I'll cut him. I...
Drop the knife, Sammy.

[Mason crying]
[Rob] Drop the knife!

What the hell are you
doing here with my kids?


Put a screwdriver
through my hand.

I don't want to hear it now.
Look at it.

Look what she did to me!
[Rob] Drop the knife!

through my hand.

Drop the knife, man.

Drop it.
[Sammy] You owe me money, Rob.

You owe me money.

[gunshot]
[Jessica screams]

Drop the knife! On the floor!

Drop the knife.
[Sammy] All right.

It's down. It's down.
[Rob] Drop the knife!

It's down. It's down.
It's down.

[Mason crying loudly]

That's good. That's good.

Don't worry, baby.

Just go with mom.
Go with mom.

[Mason crying loudly]

You didn't answer my question.

Look what she did to my hand.

with my kids?

What are you,
some kind of pedophile?



What is that?

A tree branch fell, baby.

where ya running off to?

Thank you for coming back.

I just want to
get the kids out of here.

Hey, here.
Um, I just need my car keys.

The kids are safe.

Sammy won't hurt them now.

I... I took care of it.

Come on.
[Rob] So.

What's this
about your Nana's money?

[wood falls down]
Who oh!

I think that was easier
to put up than take down.


I need to
get the kids to the doctor.

Why?
They look fine to me.

All right?

Don't be
such a helicopter parent.

They're hungry.
We need to eat.

It's freezing
and my hand is infected

Yeah, all right.

[door opens]

[Jessica sighs deeply]

Looks like you had
a little fun in here.


I'm still clean.

Holy shit.
You weren't lying.

Holy shit balls!


Do you know what this'll buy us?


Just have all of it.
Just go and leave us alone.

[Mason coos]

You never shot it?

Wanna try?

Come on. We'll do it together.

Okay.

Okay?

Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.

There's food out in the car.

I want to feed the kids first.

We should eat something too.

It's important to eat, or you'll
get sick. You know that.

Yeah, yeah.
All... all right.

Yeah, let's eat first.


I'll get the food.
You stay here.

[â™ª]

Can I have some?

No, baby, this is for Daddy.

He's bringing our food
in from the car.

Daddy's bad.


He is.

[clanking and thudding]


I got some better stuff here.

I just picked it up
on my way over.

Better than what you gave me?

You said it was pharma grade.

[Rob chuckles]

Yeah. I was wrong.

That shit's cut heavy.

I took one hit
and lost it pretty bad.

That's what I got here so late.

Wasn't my fault.

I'm glad you didn't take it.

I'm stickin' to
crystals from now on.

I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about it.

[Mason coos]

You need to eat first.

You saw the way Sammy was.
Just wasted away.

You have to make yourself eat,

even when
you don't feel like it.

Yeah.

[Mason coos]


Thanks.
You're welcome.

Mm.

That's good.

What is this crap?

Looks like
literal crap, you know?

[Jessica soft chuckles]

It's my nana's apple butter.

Mm.


[Mason cooing]

Eat up.

[water flowing]

[liquid sizzling]

[water flowing]

[Jessica grunts in pain]
[plates clanking]

[liquid sizzling continues]

in the living room, please?

I don't want the kids to see.




Your turn.

Here.

I'm not ready yet.

I'll do it later.

No way. [chuckles]

Come on.
We're doing this together.

Hurry up.

I got one more
hit in this needle.

Well, I want a clean needle.

Tie yourself off.

[â™ª]

This is for your own good.

Hey, hey.

I don't want to hurt you, Jess.

I never did.

[â™ª]

Come on.

My hand is hurt.

[â™ª]

You bitch!
[Jessica groans in pain]

Get up and tie yourself off,
or I'll shoot you in the fish.

That's right.

[breathes heavily]

Come on.

Go ahead and kill me.

Tie yourself off.


Hey, hey.
Where you going, Jess?

Jess?
Where are you going, Jess?

Where are you going, Jess?

[door closes and locks]

[dramatic music]

Get back here.

[dramatic music]

Jess!

[door opens]

Why are you running
away from me? Hm?

I'm gonna stick this
needle in your arm.

I'm doing it, all right?

Don't be so hard on yourself.

You go to rehab one time,

you think you're better
than everyone

and you cut me out
like I'm nothing.

[gun cocking]

Like I said,
the only problem between us

is you think that
you're better than me.

But you're not.

All right? We're the same.

[breathes heavily]

We're the same.


Goddammit.

[punch thrown]

[breathing heavily and choking]

You're OD'ing.

What'd you give me, Jess?

I gave you three grams
of your shitty cut meth.

The stuff that you
locked me up with

while my babies were cold
and alone and in danger,

and I was rotting away
in a fucking pantry!

You're nothing.

I'm not nothing.

I'll break you, Jess.

[window shatters]

[loud thud]

[uplifting music]

[apple butter boiling]


[door opens]

[Mason cooing]

[door closes]

[chortling]
[Jessica] Ooh.

Oh really? Oh, really?

Easy boy.

Mommy, I got you a apple.

It was hiding.
[gasps] You did?

Well, let's take a look at it.

Come here.

Okay.

I got some good news.

The cafe in town ordered 20 jars
of Nana's Apple Butter.

They're gonna put it
on their pecan waffles.

Isn't that cool?

Is it good? Is it good?

Huh?

Is the apple good?

Well, it's just one
little brown spot here.

We'll cut it out.

Use the good parts, remember?


[Mason coos]

[Jessica chuckles]

Okay, baby,
let's practice your ABCs, okay?

Ready?

â™ª A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-I-
M-N-O-P- â™ª
