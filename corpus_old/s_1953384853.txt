This is it.
You sure?

It's the same bar that was in my dream.
Let's hurry.

What the hell is this?

I forgot.
There's an ice hockey game tonight.

How are we going to find a man
we haven't even met yet in this crowd?

He's about the same age as Dad.
Dark hair with a mole on his face.

Hurry up and find him.

A mole, eh?

Hi there.

Are you an ice hockey fan too?

I gather you're from out of town?

Yeah, never been to Saginaw before.

Well, then, let's toast, shall we?

Sounds good to me.

Dean, I found him! This way!

Who's he?
My little brother.

He's good-looking.

But you are my type.

Dean, what the hell
are you doing? Hurry!

See you again, baby.

See you again.

Are you Mr. Jim Miller?

Yeah, what do you want?

He's the guy in my dream.
Seriously?

Mr. Miller, could we have a word with you?
It's very important.

I have nothing to talk about.

Wait. This is important. Please, sir!

No, you shouldn't go into the bathroom.
Mr. Miller, open the door!

Huh?

Damn.
Sam, move over.

Here we go.

What the hell is going on?

How could this be?

What's the use of having premonitions
if you can't save people?

Are you sure he was killed?

The police said it's an accident.

No! I saw a dark shadow in my dream.

He was pulled into that toilet
by some evil force.

Okay, okay.
Let's go talk to his family then.

We're from St. Augustine's.

We're sorry to hear about your father.

Any other family members?

My mom.

Leave the woman to me.

Max, tell me what your father was like.

Nothing special. He was a normal guy.

He was a big fan
of the local ice hockey team.

He loved to drink.

He would sometimes drink too much,
till he lost his memory.

I think that's how
something like that happened.

I see.

I know it's hard on you,
but you have to...

...look after your mom from now on.

Yeah.

How is this house?

What do you mean?

Well, an old house like this
tends to have its problems, right?

Leaking pipes, wiring problems.

Not really.

We moved to this place five years ago
from Freeland.

I see.

In times like these, children of the Lord
must take hand in hand. Amen.

Jeez, Dean.

You guys are brothers?
You don't look alike.

I agree with you.

We lost our mother
when we were little...

...and it's been just our father
and us two since then.

I fought with my father a lot.

I left home to go to college
and haven't seen him since.

You've never thought of leaving home?

I know, it's kind of embarrassing,
still living with my folks at 22.

No. It means
you get along well as a family.

Oh, sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

I'm Sam. Sam Winchester.
Good to meet you.

Thanks.

No electromagnetic disturbances, eh?

How's it going?

No EMF reaction.

There are no evil spirits or demons
in this house.

Wipe that off.
Huh?

Ketchup.
Oh.

They've got good sausage.

Unbelievable.

Hey, Dean.
Huh?

This is blood.

It's not ketchup?

Just kidding.

I had that blood analyzed.

It's dog's blood.
Dog?

There was no dog in that house.

It might have been killed by
that black thing you saw in your dreams.

I've been doing some research.

But I found no killings that could have
been done by spirits or demons.

Yeah, things look
pretty slow around this town.

No casinos, no strip joints.
It just makes me yawn.

The bar where Jim died had
no signs of demons or spirits either.

Then why did I dream it?

Man, I don't know.
You can't trust dreams.

Your dreams can't predict reality
all the time.

If dreams could come true, I'd have
gotten laid by Kate Hudson by now.

It could be a curse.

Someone might have had
a grudge against Jim.

But his wife said Jim was a good husband
and never had any trouble with anyone.

Then something might have
happened in Freeland.

Max said they were there
until five years ago.

Whoa, you're not thinking
of going to Freeland, are you?

Of course I am.

Man, you're stubborn.

Jim Miller?
Yes.

I believe they had lived around here
until five years ago.

I remember them well.

They used to live across the street.

And what would you like to know?

Is Max unharmed?

Unharmed, you say?

I feel so sorry for that boy.

His father, Jim, had no problem
outside their home.

<i>But he'd come home drunk</i>
<i>and kick and hit Max.</i>

<i>What in the world?</i>

<i>I heard Jim yell
at him every single day.</i>

<i>Max always had bruises.</i>

<i>There were times I just had to</i>
<i>call the police.</i>

<i>But each time his stepmother told</i>
<i>the police that everything was fine.</i>

<i>- Stepmother?</i> 
<i>- Yes.</i>

<i>Max's real mother died</i>
<i>when he was just a baby.</i>

Their house caught fire.

That stepmother
pretended she didn't see anything...

...no matter how much
Max screamed and cried.

Hey, Sam.

What's wrong? Sam.
Get ahold of yourself!

I didn't do anything, did I?

Yeah, you're right.

You didn't do anything for me, Mom.

You just stood there and watched.

You never tried to help me. Ever.

What are you doing?

Impossible. How did you?

Max. Please stop.

How many times do you think
I begged for your help?

You never did anything.
You just stood there watching.

I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

Max!

It's too late!

You okay, Sam?

Max did it.
What?

Max killed Jim.
Now he's going to kill his stepmother.

But how? Did he use
black magic or something?

No. I think he used
some kind of telekinesis.

Telekinesis? Does that mean
he's a spoon-bender?

He doesn't need to touch things
to move them.

The dark shadow
I saw in my vision was Max.

My premonition must've been
linked to Max.

Why would you and Max be connected?

I don't know.
Maybe it's because we're alike.

How?

Well, we both lost our mothers
when we were little.

No, you're totally wrong.
He's a murderer.

But when you look at his childhood...

And that justifies
him killing his entire family?

He's a monster.

He's no different than
anything else we've hunted.

Are you going to kill him?

We have to. Should we report
telekinesis to the police instead?

They won't even arrest him,
much less lock him up.

Or let him kill his stepmother?

I know, but he is human.

Let's talk to him. He'll understand.

Dean, please. Let me handle it this time.

All right. But I'm taking this with me.

I don't have much of a chance
against telekinesis without a gun.

What are you doing?

Max, please. Help!

How many times
have I begged for your help?

I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

It's too late!

Father Winchester.

Max, I'd like to talk to you.

Can we talk upstairs?
Just you and me?

I heard about what you
went through in Freeland.

You've been beaten up
by your father, haven't you?

You had a dog?

<i>When my dad beat me</i>
<i>and threw me out in the rain...</i>

<i>...I found the puppy,</i>
<i>all skinny and ragged.</i>

<i>It was as if I was
looking at myself.</i>

So I snuck him back into the house
and kept him.

Hope was my only true family.

But then Dad came home drunk
last week.

Dad?

Max, what the hell
is this thing doing here?

Dad, stop! Don't hurt Hope!

Hope? What hope do you think
this world has anyway?

What kind of hope
do you have in your life?

You little demon!

Please stop!

Mom, help! Please help, Mom!

A demon like you
doesn't deserve to have a dog!

You understand? Now take it out
and get rid of it.

Hope...

Dad hated me for the longest time.

He called me a demon all the time.

Demon?
Yeah.

Dad believed
that I had killed my real mother.

Why is that?

When I was sleeping in my crib...

...my mom was pinned to
the ceiling above me.

He told me that she burst
into flames and died.

Max...

...my mother and my girlfriend
died the same way.

The same thing must've killed them.

We must be connected somehow. That
explains why I had premonition about you.

Premonition?
Yeah.

I saw you killing your father in
the bathroom at that bar in my dream.

I also saw you stabbing your mom's eye
with a knife.

That's why I rushed here.

That's impossible.

I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but it's true.

You started having these powers
about six months ago, didn't you?

Yeah.
Me too.

This has to mean something.

We've been chosen for a reason.

Reason?

What the hell is the reason for this?

What's the reason for me
being beaten all these years...

...and for Hope being killed?

I would've persevered
if it was just me.

But he hurt Hope!

This is a God-given gift, you see?
God gave it to me...

...who was alone and had nothing.

But you're not alone anymore.

I'm here for you.
I'm here because you called me.

In my dream you looked like
you were calling out for help.

So, Max, please stop killing people
with your telekinetic power.

I promise I'll help you.

Thank you, Sam.

But no one can help me.

Max, please.

Forgive me.

Sam!

Max?

Where's Sam?

What was all that noise?

You're not priests, are you?
Why do you have this?

Max!

Don't do it.

Max!

Dean!

Max. Don't tell me...

Don't do it.

Don't do it!

Sam!

Max?

Don't tell me... This is...

You're not priests, are you?
Why do you have this?

Max!

Don't do it.

Max.

Don't shoot!

Don't do it, Max.

Sam.

I promise I'll help you.
You don't need to deal with this alone.

I know you know deep down...

...that doing this won't help a thing.

Max.

Please!

Please don't shoot.

You're right. This is meaningless.

I shouldn't have said such a thing.

You did what you could.
Don't blame yourself.

Listen, Dean.
What is it?

I wonder why the demon killed
Mom, Jessica and Max's mom.

Beats me.

Maybe it was Max and me
that he was after.

We both have these powers
that ordinary people don't.

Maybe Mom and Jessica were killed
because of me.

What was that for?

To stop you from talking bullshit!

Bullshit?
Yeah. You're always moaning...

...about what might've been your fault.

The thing that killed them
is to be blamed. Not you.

<i>May I have your order?</i>

Well, two cheeseburgers and two Cokes.

<i>Very well, sir.</i>

There's one more thing I have to say.

Oh, jeez, what now?
When I was locked up in Max's room...

...I had a vision of you getting killed,
and then moved that heavy bed.

Like Max, with telekinesis.

Bend this.

Aren't you worried?
What if I turn out like Max?

Nope. I'm not worried even a bit.

Because you've got something
Max didn't have.

Huh? What?

Me.

I'm always with you
and will protect you all the way.

Sounds creepy, you idiot.

<i>- Here is the weather in Michigan.</i> 
You baby.

<i>We have sunny days ahead of us.</i> 
<i>No signs of rain for a while.</i>

<i>Tomorrow will be a beautiful day</i>
<i>with clear skies.</i>

Thank you for waiting.

Ah, you're...!

My goodness. We did meet again.

But, unfortunately, we're leaving town.

Where are you headed?

Don't know. Up to God's will.

See you again, if I'm lucky.

Be careful, boys.
A storm is coming.

Sam. Dean. See you again someday.

Sam. Dean. See you again someday.
