<i>[tense music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[crows cawing]

[chains rattling]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Ah.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Yeah, I tell everybody
that attempts the 50,

there ain't shit out here,

but you gotta be prepared
for anything.

A bunch of fun-loving kids
stole the zigzag

out of the back of the
sheriff's pickup a month ago.

Guess you found it for 'em.

You know what some folks
consider funny?

Just ruin
a man's whole damn day.

God's honest truth.

Now, where'd you say
you're from?

Oh, you're one of those guys

that don't wanna look back,
huh?

You're one where the past lives
in the past, huh?

Yeah, I understand.
No, I can't blame you.

I mean, we all got
so much baggage.

I just say, move forward.

You're a rolling stone.
Yup.

We had a car chase around here
a while back.

Some boy got up
to 150 miles an hour,

just launched it right off
Tension's Peak, man.

It's like a superhero.
It went fwoom!

Carnage was terrible.
It was just... wow.

<i>[intense music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[siren wails]

Oh, fuck me.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[engine revving]

Will you just stop it?
Open the door!

I'll open the damn door.

What the hell
is wrong with you?

No!
God damn it.

Hey Jed, what's up?

This old boy had
the misfortune

of finding your zigzags
out there.

I figured
I'd bring 'em back to you.

He all right?
Yeah, he'll be all right.

Tire's not, but he'll be fine.

He had this pretty Camaro
right here.

Yes, yes, it was
that ocean blue...

<i>[soft music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Jed, I'll come by
and get 'em later.

All turning around,
spinning out, everything.

He just slid right in there
and then pop, pop...

I don't have time
for this today, okay?

Yes, ma'am.

[engine turns over]

Take this off me.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

There's not a chance in hell

I'm letting you out
of this trailer tonight.

I hate you.

Oh, talk sweet to me
all you want.

Get down.
You know the drill. Get down.

Get out of my way.
Come here.

What the hell are you doing?

Wait.
I'll be back in the morning.

What... how the hell
am I supposed to eat?

How am I supposed
to take a piss?

There are chips
is on the coffee table

and a bucket on the floor.

Try not to make a mess.

You're a bitch.

Oh, I love you too.


<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>[tense musical stings]</i>

Hey, it's gonna be
about $250 for the tow,

and we'll need
all four tires replaced.

And there was something wrong
with that chip, I think.

But I can fix it
for about $1,000.

Yep.

No, cash only. Uh-uh, no.
And in advance.

Yeah, I don't take
no plastic credit cards.

Oh, that over there.

Yeah, we ain't got
no internet in Hayesville.

Yeah, so all the ATMs,
they just don't work.

Yeah, we were gonna get it,
but they just didn't.


You ain't got the cash, huh?

Now ain't that a dilly
of a pickle?

Hmm.

You willing to work it off?

Okay, then.

I think I've got somebody
who can accommodate.

[keypad beeping]
<i>[line rings]</i>

Hey, kid.

I got a guy for you.

[train whistle blows]

You want god to laugh,

you tell him your plans.


Howdy there, partner.

My name is Tex,
same as the state.

Got the handle Macadoo.

Welcome to Willy's Wonderland.

Yeah, he don't talk much.
And I respect that.

I enjoy a man of few words.

Well, business is not
what it used to be,

but I am fixing to reopen

and make Willy's
better than ever.

Anyway, enough horseshit.
Here's my offer.

You spend the night
cleaning Willy's Wonderland

and I will pay
to have your car fixed.

I go on in tomorrow,
you come out of there,

and your ride will be
ready for you right there.

Deal?

<i>[tense music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

If not, I got places to be.


All right. All right.

Let's go inside.

Good luck, mister.

[door squeaks]

Watch your step.

Check this out.

<i>Hey kids,
it's Willy the Weasel.</i>

<i>Welcome to my wonderland.</i>

<i>Come on down
and meet the gang.</i>

<i>We've got Arty the Alligator,
Siren Sara,</i>

<i>Cammy the Chameleon,
Gus Gorilla,</i>

<i>Knighty Knight,
Ozzie the Ostrich,</i>

<i>and Tito the Turtle.</i>

â™ª It's your birthday,
so let's party, everyone â™ª

<i>â™ª It's your birthday
and we want you to have fun â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's your birthday,
so let's party, everyone â™ª</i>

We had some great times.

Kids laughing, smiling,

eating hot dogs,
opening presents.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

You know the story, right?

Well, some of these
little bastards start crawling

over the characters,
they get hurt.

A couple of lawsuits later
from Mommy Safety Organizations

and wham, bam, thank you ma'am,

we're out of business.

Shut us right down.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Damn thing always gets jammed.


Yeah.

This stuff oughta do the trick.

Broom, mop, bucket,
drain snake,

Windex, rags,
whatever you need, we got it.

Oh, lookee here.

Congratulations.

You are officially on staff.


Well, pal,
it's gonna be dark soon.

I'll be back in the morning
with that car of yours

dapper and ready to drive
or my name is not Tex Macadoo.


Help yourself to whatever
you can find in the kitchen.

It's on the house.

And be sure to take breaks.

Always good to pace yourself.

That's it.
Good luck.

Damn.

I thought you quit.

My last one.

Piece of shit.

All right,
let's get the hell outta here.

I can't stand to hear
a grown man scream.

Liv, you in there?
Oh, shit.

Yeah, I'm in here.
Can you help me out?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, calm down, dude.

No need to be a superhero.

Oh!
Oh, my God.

Oh, damn it! Oh!

Nice one, genius.
The door was unlocked.

How am I supposed
to know that?

Oh, shit.

Let me see if we can find
something

to get you out of that.

She gave you a bucket?

Bitch is wicked.

Liv, you okay?
Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just...

I found a screwdriver.

What the hell are we gonna do
with a screwdriver?

Have y'all never worn
handcuffs before?

Oh, shut up.

Why not just look
for the key?

What the hell am I looking
in the fridge for?

God, these eggs are
definitely bad.

We need, like, a saw
or a pliers or something.

Pliers?
Can't find no key in here.

Shut up and find something.
You shut up!

You ain't had no handcuffs on.

[clears throat]

Gee, thanks for the help, guys.

Cool. We good.
Yo.

Come on. We're late.
I saw the bait already.

Where?

Well, he was with Jed
in his truck.

Probably locked inside Willy's
by now.

Well, let's roll out.
I wanna see that bitch burn.

Yeah, burn, baby, burn.

Wait, guys, this isn't
for your entertainment, okay?

It's for doing what's right.

It's gotta be
a little entertaining.

Look, I wanna see
them freak bastards die

for what I see 'em do.

Shut up, dude.
What have you seen them do?

Remember that one time
I was...

Okay, shut up.
Guys.

If we're doing this,

we're gonna do this
as a mission,

not a field trip.

Are you with me or not?

Yeah, we're with you, Liv.

Whatever you say.

Yeah.

All right. Let's do this.

Hey, Chris.
What?

Can you pour gas
literally anywhere else?

I'm sorry you pour
like crap, Aaron.

You're pouring gas
on top of my gas.

All right,
let me go over here

and I'll just paint the bush.
Perfect. Thank you.

Hey, you blowing bubbles?
Bring your ass.

You forgot the lighter,
didn't you?

No, I didn't.

Then let me see it.
Oh, my God.

There you go.
Yeah, all right.

Wait, wait, wait.
Uh-uh. Not yet.

[scoffs]
That guy's still in there.

We gotta get him out first.

[knocking at window]

Hey, sir! Sir!

You're not safe in there.
We gotta get you out.

Hey!
Well, that was rude.

Hey, look,
if he don't wanna be safe,

it's his ass, not ours.

Tough shit.

I'm getting him out
whether he likes it or not.

You wanna go in there
with those things?

Are you high?

Look, if he wanna
be cremated,

that's his business.
Yeah.

I'm sorry,
but I'm just not okay

with letting somebody
burn alive in there

if we can do something
about it.

She's right.
Of course she is, Chris.

Oh, shut up!

Hurry this shit up
so we can go home.

I'll figure out
how to get inside,

but I'm not putting
you guys in danger.

You just figure out
how to get us out once I do.

Okay.

<i>[eerie music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Uh-uh.

Not today, girlfriend.


Ow.

Come play with me.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

â™ª Ring around the rosie â™ª

â™ª A pocketful of posies â™ª

â™ª Ashes, ashes â™ª

â™ª We all fall â™ª


<i>Holy shit.
Guys, that was Liv.</i>

We gotta go after her.

I'm out this bitch.
Y'all playing.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Both: Bobby!

What?

Are y'all serious right now?

We supposed to go in there
and get killed too?

You wanna stay here?
We gotta do something.

No, I actually wanna leave,

and I thought y'all might
want to also, but I don't care.

Fine. I'll go.
No, no, I'll go.

No, wait... hey, stop, stop.

This is Liv
we're talking about.

Move out of the way.
What? No!

Damn!

Hey, hey. Whoa, hey.
Y'all look away.

Baby, God damn.
Hey, y'all back up, man.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[branches snap]

[both grunt]

Thank God you're still alive.
We gotta get you outta here.

I stopped that bitch,

but that won't keep her away
for long, so...

hey!

Did you not hear
what I just said?

Hey!

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

We go in, fast, we split up,
and as soon as we find Liv

and this janitor dude,
we're out.

Hmm.
What, Aaron?

We just don't need any more
Batman bullshit, all right?

Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, I know.

It's only going to make it
less safe for everyone else.

You mean
kinda like Liv just did?

Excuse me?

Say what you gotta say.
Speak up.

Now's the time, Dan.

You ain't gonna say it?

Do you guys have
something in mind?

Hell yeah, we do.

Everything you telling us
not to do,

that's exactly what your dream
girl got us up here doing.

And now we probably all getting
fucked up because of it.

Bobby.
What?

Am I lying?

No, I'm not. It's the truth.

Fine. I'll just go myself.
Oh, whatever, Chris.

When are you getting it through
your thick-ass skull, huh?

Kissing that ass

ain't gonna get you
that ass, playboy.

It'll more than likely
get you killed,

and ain't nobody,
except for you, baby,

worth none of this bullshit
you got us up here doing.

So you know what?
I'm out this bitch.

Baby, let's go.

No, Chris! Chris!

Oh, shit!
[screams]

Bobby!

[all scream]


God damn!
Everybody okay?

Yeah.
Nice of you guys to join us.

Wait, what are you guys
doing here?

Oh, my God.
Liv, you're alive.

I thought we all agreed you
were supposed to stay outside

and help us find a way out.

Yeah, uh...

Now how the hell are we
supposed to get out of here?

I tried to keep 'em
on the roof,

but they wouldn't listen.

It's your fault
we were on the roof.

It's my fault?
It was your fault.

Guys, guys, it's happening.
It's happening now.

Oh, that's the nasty bitch
that tried to kill me.

Liv.

â™ª We're all friends â™ª

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

Hey, what the hell, man?
What are you... dude!

Put her down, okay?

I'm trying to help you,
you dumbass!

Seriously?

I'm trying
to help him understand

that he's gonna die in here,
but he won't listen to me.

â™ª Sing, sing, sing â™ª

Wait a second.

Wasn't there eight of them?

<i>[chipper music]</i>

â™ª We're all friends â™ª

â™ª We like to run â™ª
Oh, that's badass.

â™ª Run, run, run
to the beat of the drum â™ª

Oh, this is good.

We're connecting.
We're sharing our feelings.

â™ª We're all friends â™ª

â™ª We like to dance â™ª

â™ª Dance, dance, dance â™ª

â™ª Like there's ants
in our pants â™ª

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Whoa.

Have you been
to my Super Happy Fun Room yet?

This is cool.

Well, what are you
waiting for?

â™ª The Super Happy Fun Room
is super happy fun â™ª

Yo. Look.
â™ª Join us in the Fun Room â™ª

â™ª Where you'll be number one â™ª

â™ª Popcorn, cake, and hot dogs â™ª
Let's go.

â™ª Soda and candy too â™ª

â™ª The Super Happy Fun Room â™ª

I know the bullshit story
they told you.

That if you clean up
the place tonight,

they'll pay to have your tires
fixed by morning, right?

It's a lie.

They've said the same story

to countless other
over the last 20 years.

They baited you.

You're here
to be a human sacrifice.

You're here to be eaten
and killed.

Do you understand that?

This town has a dark history.

And it all starts
with this horrible place.

<i>You know, Willy's may seem</i>

<i>like a happy-go-lucky
child's play place,</i>

<i>but it's much, much more
than that.</i>

<i>Willy's was built in 1996,</i>

<i>the brainchild
of Jerry Robert Willis.</i>

<i>If that name sounds familiar
to you, it should.</i>

<i>Jerry was
one of the last century's</i>

<i>most sick and sadistic
serial killers.</i>

<i>Jerry spent most of the time
cultivating similar sickos.</i>

<i>I mean, these were
the most depraved people</i>

<i>you could ever imagine.</i>

<i>Often, Jerry
and his crew would</i>

<i>whisk away
unsuspecting families</i>

<i>to the Super Happy Fun Room.</i>

<i>Once inside,</i>

<i>the families would be treated
to a birthday cake</i>

<i>and a private show
by Willy Weasel.</i>

<i>The shows would always end
the same way.</i>

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>After numerous
missing persons reports</i>

and suspicious smells coming
from the inside of Willy's,

the law felt it was time
to investigate.

[sirens wailing]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>Jerry and his gang refused</i>

<i>to be taken alive.</i>

<i>After the police
finally entered</i>

<i>the Super Happy Fun Room,</i>

<i>they discovered
that Jerry and his crew</i>

<i>had performed
a satanic suicide ritual.</i>

<i>Instead of surrendering,</i>

<i>the killers decided
to take their own lives.</i>

<i>Those familiar
with satanic rituals speculate</i>

<i>that the suicide ritual
was some sort of a Katra</i>

<i>transfer of energy</i>

<i>where the memory</i>

<i>and consciousness
of the living</i>

<i>relocate into
non-living entities.</i>

In this case,
the animatronic robots.

<i>Ten years later,
Willy's reopens</i>

<i>with a new owner, Tex Macadoo.</i>

<i>He tries to keep
the current public</i>

<i>unaware of its horrific past.</i>

<i>Things are wrong
from the start.</i>

<i>There's reports
that the creatures would</i>

<i>move on their own.</i>

<i>Some would say things</i>

<i>they weren't programmed
to say.</i>

Wanna fuck, fatty?

<i>And others would kill</i>

<i>and feast on customers.</i>

<i>After several
ghastly incidents,</i>

<i>Willy's closes
its doors again.</i>

But Tex still doesn't
bulldoze it to the ground.

Why, you may ask?

Because Willy got to him.

Convinced him to make a deal
with the devil.

Along with all those
other backwoods inbreds

in this sorry town.

Speaking of
backwoods inbreds,

where'd Bob and Kathy go?

[door creaks]

<i>[eerie music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Whoa.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

This is where
it actually happened.

This is where those
kid killers offed themselves.

Oh.

Cool.

The fuck?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Okay, yeah, this is...

this is weird as fuck.

Yo, who the hell bringing
their kids up in here?

Shit, not my kids.

Not our kids.

Is it weird that I'm getting
really turned on right now?

Oh, you a <i>freak</i> freak.

It's never seemed
to bother you before.

Who says it bothers me now?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hmm.

Happy birthday, baby.

It's not my birthday.

I still wanna see you
in your birthday suit.

Have you been listening
to a word I've been saying?

Look at all these
naughty birthday boys

and birthday girls.
Oh, shit.

I think it's time for them
to go nightie night.

â™ª It's your birthday
and we want you to have fun â™ª

â™ª It's your birthday,
so let's kill everyone â™ª

[both screaming]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>


I really need you to help me
find my friends.

Please.
[screams]

Oh, my God. Kathy!

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Oh, my God.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[breathing heavily]

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I'm so sorry.

<i>[cheerful 8-bit tune]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Hello, little boy.

You don't have to be
afraid of me.

I'm not the same as the others.

They're so mean to me.

They call me ugly

and they make fun
of my colorful skin.

I'm trapped in this body.

I just want to be free.

I guess I don't expect you
to believe me.

I hoped
that you were different.

<i>[eerie music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

I'm Chris.

Trust me, Chris.
You know you can.

You can feel my goodness.

If what you're saying
is true,

and you're not like
the others...

I could help you
get to the next life?

It's true.

Evil has kept me here.

You must have questions.

I can tell you so much
about the other side.

I can answer
all your questions.

If you can help me.

[siren wailing]

You ever use your sidearm?

Oh. In training.

But these are just
punk kids, right?

What, vandalizing
and loitering?

I doubt we'll need to drop 'em.

It's not the kids.

It's Willy.

The dancing rat?


Okay.

I get it. I get it.

The boys told you
to pull a fast one on me.

Bravo. Nice try.

It ain't no prank.

This is real as it gets.
I guaran-damn-tee you that.

<i>See, in town, we knew
what was happening at Willy's.</i>

<i>We knew there was something
supernatural going on.</i>

<i>We bellowed
to the high heavens</i>

<i>that the machines were evil.</i>

<i>No one believed us.</i>

<i>They thought we were yokels.</i>

<i>Tex eventually hired
a demolition crew</i>

<i>to destroy Willy's,</i>

<i>except the day before
bulldozers were set to roll,</i>

<i>Eric Miller, the contractor,
was found in bed</i>

<i>as chewed up
as a McDonald's hamburger.</i>

His whole family too.

After that,
there wasn't a man alive

that would take the job.

The town decided
that maybe it was better

to let sleeping dogs lie.

We told everybody
just to stay away from there.

We figured
we'd just let it rot.

<i>But rabid dogs don't sleep
when they're hungry.</i>

<i>The machines got out.</i>

<i>We found bodies
at the ice cream shop,</i>

<i>the hardware store,
and even the school.</i>

We had a real Hobson's choice
on our hands.

You know what that is?

No.

No choice at all.

We could either go to war
with the machines,

come off like crazy people,

probably lose
a lot of good folk

along the way, or...

Or what?

We cut a deal.

Leave our people be.

Leave our children be.

Leave our town be, and...

and we will feed you.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>Well, the good news is,
I can fix it.</i>

<i>The bad news is,</i>

it's gonna have to sit
till I get the part.

Now, Hayesville's
one hotel's booked.

But I do have a place
you can stay tonight.

Now, it ain't the Ritz,
but it's a roof

and it's free

if you're willing to do
a little light cleaning.

Best place for a birthday
party you've ever seen.

Heck, it once was,
but we're gonna fix it.

Bring her back to life.

Congratulations.

You are officially on staff.

We lived up to our end
of the bargain

and they kept theirs.

<i>We tried to find people
who wouldn't be missed.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>People with
low moral character.</i>

<i>And some people who were just at
the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[both scream]

Things didn't always go
exactly as planned.

<i>I usually pride myself</i>

<i>on being able to expect
the unexpected.</i>


<i>But sometimes,
life throws you a zinger.</i>

<i>[soft music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>Well, this was the zinger
of all zingers.</i>

Good night, darling.

Sweet dreams.

I never saw it coming.

So that's why we're going?

Liv.

Much as she pisses me off,

I couldn't live
with losing that girl.

I can show you
what's on the other side.

If you could help me get there.

Oh, Chris.
Liv, Liv, it's gonna be okay.

Kay, we're gonna make a deal
and...

[grunting]

<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Wanna play, bitch?

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

girlfriend.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

[gun cocks]

Drop the lizard.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Get that stuff off of her.

Willy, I'm so sorry
about this prick.

Eloise, please, stop.
He's a good guy.

Shut your yap
and get outside.

They killed some of 'em.

Oh.
Stupid idiots.

It'll just incite him more.

Willy, this guy does not
act for us.

His actions should
in no way reflect

on the town of Hayesville.

You know that, right, Willy?

Well, cuff him.

For God's sakes, cuff him.

No way.
I'm not leaving him here.

I'll give you two reasons
why you are:

your wife and your kid.

If we don't do
what needs to be done,

nobody in this county is safe.

Why couldn't you just die?

Where are the others?

They're dead.

Stupid kids.

Do you see?

Okay, time to go.

Go.
No. Uh-uh.

I'm not leaving without him.

I'm not giving you a choice.
Go.

I'm not leaving without him.
Get out of here.

You don't understand.

You've locked the wrong guy up
in here.

He's not trapped
in here with them.

They're trapped in here
with him.

Not for much longer.

I'm sorry son.

[door creaks]

Is that what you did
to my parents?

You're a monster.

What do we do now?

Well, I'm gonna wait here

until this problem
solves itself.

You drop her off in a cell,
come back, and get me.

Should be done by then.

[animatronic creaking]

Hey, cowboy.

Ready for a little
mÃ©nage Ã  trois?

You can't arrest me
Can and will.

Breaking and entering,
destruction of property,

and I'm pretty sure that was
a dead body on the floor.

What's worse,
the dead body you saw,

or the guy
that you left to die?

Are you ready to be a murderer?

Because that's
exactly what you're gonna be.

You're gonna be
a cold-blooded...

[tires squeal]

Shut up! I ain't no murderer.

Then what are you?

You're complicit.

You're just another cult member
recruited by the sheriff

to do all of her dirty work.

I ain't no cult member
and I ain't no murderer.

And how 'bout you, huh?

Living with the sheriff
all these years,

all this going on,
what have you done?

You don't know what it's like
living with her.

My entire life,
it's like I've been a ghost.

And no matter what I do,
it doesn't change who she is.

So I thought maybe
I could do something right

and burn
this fucking place down.

So I am doing something.

What about you?
Hmm?

You just gonna sit there
and watch all of this happen

and not do anything about it?

I'm gonna set things right.

That's what I'm
goddamn gonna do.

You'll see.

We had a good thing,

and fucked it all up.

Look at me.

Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

All you had to do was die.

Was that so hard?

No, you just had to go ahead
and stay alive,

and now we got five dead kids

because of you!

You might have taken apart
a few electronics,

but I got a feeling
that you can't stop a round.

Willy!

Willy needs to eat,
