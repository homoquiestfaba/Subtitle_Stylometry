<i>"Information"...</i>

<i>the very nature of the word</i>
<i>is beginning to change.</i>

<i>The world is shrinking.</i>

Borders are collapsing...

cultures are growing closer and closer
day by day.

Information is the new unexplored frontier.

And in the forefront of this new age is,
of course...

the Internet.

Are you sure this is a big story?

"Scoop," Joaquim. The proper term
is scoop. And, yeah, I'm sure.

Cute secretaries don't lie. Well...

Hank, you're my hero.

-Hey, where are you going?
-Press.

Do you have an appointment?

There's a coup going on in that boardroom.
That's news.

You need an appointment to get in.

7tv, Hank Robinson, right there.

Okay, rock and roll.

-Public broadcasting?
-Is that a problem?

Take it easy, Hank.

No, take it easy?
I'm not going to take it easy.

I don't need this guy
keeping me out of here...

because he doesn't like
the company I'm working for.

How come he waltzes through?

<i>Señor</i> Aribau has the exclusive rights
to all Nova communications.

The number of people who get their news
from the Internet...

as opposed to, you know,
TV or newspapers...

grows by 1 million worldwide each year.

One million.

Just follow my lead, and it'll be fine, okay?

Good morning, Christina,
you look beautiful. Can I see the boss?

Just a minute, please.

The conclusion is obvious.

He who controls the Internet...

controls information.

In the last three years,
Nova communications...

have carved a widening niche
in the telecommunications market.

Well, I believe it's time we expanded.

Did you call the press, <i>Señor</i> Pla?

No, I did not.

If you think something newsworthy
is going to happen today...

you are very much mistaken.

You may be our main stockholder,
but I'm still president of this company.

I direct policy. Nothing will change that.

Hank Robinson reporting from Barcelona.

I am standing in front
of the headquarters of Nova...

the fastest growing
telecommunications company in Spain.

Today, majority shareholder Manuel Pla
is challenging Nova president Sert...

inside the boardroom,
while I stand out here in the parking lot.

Come on, let's go again.

Take two.

What's this?

This is my offer, <i>Señor</i> Sert.

Quite generous, I think.

You're trying to buy me out?

We get a two-shot
and we go to lunch, okay?

Everybody down! On the floor. Now!

-Don't move!
-Oh, no!

What the hell is that?

What the hell is going on here?

-What's the meaning of this?
-Oh, my God!

Jesus Christ!

Let's go.

-Go? Go where?
-In there, where the story is.

You know what else is in there?
Someone with a gun.

-Give me the camera.
-No!

Fine.

Nothing is worth dying for, man.

-Call the police, I'm going in.
-Hank.

-Who are you people?
-We are Anarchy Now.

Your company spreads lies
to confuse innocent people.

Gunfire at the Nova offices.

Always make sure there's film in the camera.

You support the capitalist pigs.
This is your reward.

All of you, get out of here! Come on, run!

Run!

Tell everyone the truth.

Boss!

Listen, call Veronica.
Tell her I've got footage of Sert's murder.

<i>Acts of terror have become so commonplace</i>
<i>in our age...</i>

<i>that we run the risk</i>
<i>of becoming used to their images...</i>

<i>to becoming desensitised to them.</i>

<i>The day that these shocking, horrific images</i>
<i>fail to appal us...</i>

<i>is the day that we begin to lose</i>
<i>some of our humanity.</i>

<i>Let's let these images speak for themselves.</i>
<i>I, for one, will not soon forget them.</i>

-My favourite part's coming up.
<i>-This is Hank Robinson reporting...</i>

<i>with a 7tv news exclusive.</i>

And we're out.

Pure genius.

It helps to have
the hottest producer in town.

All the major wires called.
They want to licence your video.

-Bleed them dry.
-And our ratings are climbing.

We got 20 share tonight.
Thousands of people tuned in.

-How does it feel being a star?
-Twenty share?

Speaking as your producer, I'm thrilled.

Speaking as your girlfriend...

don't ever risk your life like that again.

With great risks come great rewards.

What you did was the most inspiring thing
I've ever seen.

Veronica.

That tape...

The thing is...

-I just--
-Proved to the world...

what I've always known.
You're the real deal, Hank.

I love you.

And I don't want to lose you.

I love you, too.

I have to rinse.

Yes, I understand all that,
but just get him for me.

At 3:00, you're interviewing
Cardinal Rosselli.

-I thought he never meets the press.
-He agreed to talk to you.

This is a real scoop.

Ronnie. I'm getting audio interference
on Camera 2.

-Interference?
-Either God's talking to us...

<i>or it's someone's cell phone.</i>

His polls are rather low.

Excuse me, sir. Can't you see the sign?

I'm most terribly sorry.
Very thoughtless of me.

Nicola, I'll have to call you back.

I'm Archibald McGovern.

And you are Veronica Nadal.

Top of your class of
the Barcelona School of Journalism. 1999?

'98, actually.

I'm here to see Mr. Robinson.

So, this is 7tv. Well, it's quaint.

Is your studio fully soundproof?

Of course. Some of the equipment
has been here since the '60s.

That's all, it needs to be replaced.

A journalist of Mr. Robinson's stature
deserves better.

We are only a local station,
we take what we can get.

-Jordi, what the hell are you doing?
-Sorry, Miss Nadal.

You can start by replacing him.

Excuse me.

Hank Robinson? Archie McGovern, owner--

And CEO of Vision Television News.
Pleasure, sir. Pleasure to meet you.

I'm sorry, this will have to wait.
Hank goes on in 10 minutes.

Have you met Veronica, my producer?

Oh, yes, indeed. And I will only take five.

You have to forgive her.
She's a little protective.

And rightly so. You're her gold mine.

So that's McGovern. Seems like a nice guy.

Yeah, that's just what they said about Hitler.

-Okay. Let's get Hank's sound levels up.
<i>-WeII, we did start 7tv together.</i>

-Shall we?
<i>-It's kind of our baby.</i>

<i>Scrimping and scavenging for every cent...</i>

<i>hunting down stories,</i>
<i>hoping and praying for the exclusive...</i>

<i>that would put you on the map.</i>

Yes, I know that life. I know it very well.

So tell me, Hank,
how many viewers does 7tv get a week?

70,000? 100,000?

55,000, sir.

Vision TV...

is watched by 10 million people
every night, and growing.

<i>I know, sir. What can I do for you?</i>

Mr. Robinson, I'm here
on a rather serious matter.

The late Carlos Aribau.
Did you know that he worked for me?

Yes, he was a wonderful reporter.
He'll be missed.

On the morning of the Nova attack,
I sent Carlos to interview <i>Señor</i> Sert...

and then, your story came to my attention.

Mr. Robinson, you represent...

Well, Hank, you represent everything...

that Vision TV has come to stand for.

And I would like you to join our family.

I beg your pardon?

That's right, Hank,
your gravy train has come in.

I'm going to have to talk to someone
about that.

I understand. I'm sure she will realise
what a grand opportunity this is for you.

-Bring her along if you like.
-Thank you, sir.

Of course he wants to hire you.

Guys like McGovern
are afraid of guys like you.

You report the story.
McGovern, he reports the official story.

-He gets us into 10 million households.
-Yeah, but at what price?

My father worked for 10 years
before the networks called...

and when they did, he jumped at it.

Hank, we are so close
to achieving everything we wanted.

-Don't throw away our independence.
-It's a good thing.

-This is a good thing.
-You made a decision like that without me?

-I'm your partner, I'm your girlfriend.
-They promised to hire you.

I already have everything I've ever wanted.
At least, I thought I did.

Veronica, please sit down.

Women.

-Let me buy you a drink.
-No, I got to go.

I think you're doing the right thing.

Vision TV, man.

That's a big time.

-Yeah.
-Need a cameraman?

You know what? I'll bet they probably do.
I'll ask them, all right?

You do that.

-Hank.
-Yeah?

My camcorder...

the one you filmed your Nova story with.

It wasn't loaded.

Sure it was.

No, it wasn't. I number all my tapes.

It was empty.

What's your point?

None of my business how you got the story.
Just share the wealth, you know?

I'm a talented guy, and I'm shooting porn
to make ends meet.

It's a fucking crime.

Are you blackmailing me?

No, I would never do that.
We're friends, right?

-Yeah.
-Friends do friends favours.

-Sure they do.
-So, good karma.

-We understand each other.
-Oh, yeah.

-We understand each other.
-Terrific.

I'll be seeing you, Hank.

Hey, <i>hombre,</i> that's my beer.

Hey, Hank!

Here's to us. Partners forever!

Okay.

I can't get this all done.

No, you're not listening to me.

<i>Birth of a Nation: The Founding of Iran</i>
by Howard Robinson.

Your father's book
was required reading in class.

Barcelona School of Journalism.

I'm Marisa Perez. I'm your assistant.

This is my first job.

Hello, Marisa. It's okay.
It's my first time having an assistant.

Miss Markham is waiting for you
in the newsroom.

-Of course, Nicola Markham.
-Yeah, she's our news director.

All right, the Chinese plan to have a man
on the moon by the end of the year.

Right, if their entire population
stands on each other's shoulders.

-You're late.
-Sorry, I didn't realise there was a meeting.

News happens every day, Robinson,
and every day we report it.

That's why we are called a news service.

Eduardo, the Chinese astronaut is yours,
a present from me.

And next, in Africa,
AIDS epidemic is at an all-time high.

Katrina, you run with that.

And in local news, Barcelona is once again
in the Champion's League.

Make it the lead story.

Okay, what are you waiting for? Impress me.

-Not so fast, Robinson.
-Call me Hank.

Robinson, how the hell
did you end up in Spain?

I thought there were
more career opportunities in Europe.

Meaning you couldn't cut it stateside.

If you want to last here,
you will follow instructions, <i>claro?</i>

<i>-Claro.</i>
-Good.

After assuming control of Nova...

Manuel Pla set his sights
on his main rival, Intertel.

If Pla succeeds in purchasing Intertel...

he will have a virtual monopoly
on the telecommunications market.

-First Spain, then Europe.
-Precisely.

I want you to interview Eloy Agustin,
the head of Intertel.

Find out why he won't sell,
and what he intends to do about it.

-Questions?
-No, ma'am.

Good.

I was in Tehran with your father
during the revolution.

You look a lot like him.

I hope I'm half the reporter he was.

Careful what you wish for.

<i>Señor</i> Agustin, you're dealing
with a hostile takeover bid from Nova.

How are you planning to deal
with the threat?

I have faith in the loyalty
of my stockholders.

They realise Nova is trying
to force everyone out of business.

That may be,
but we deal in a free market society.

Can you really fault them their success?

Think of a world in which one company
provided every service.

Without competition, there is no need
to maintain quality, or accountability.

Information should belong to everyone.
The Internet should be free.

Unregulated.

Thank you, sir.

This is Hank Robinson reporting
from Intertel.

We have the edit suite booked for noon...

so with any luck,
we should be done tomorrow afternoon.

-Are you enjoying your new job?
-I am, yes.

Your predecessor, Carlos Aribau,
was a friend of mine.

-Was he?
-Did you know him?

Our paths crossed briefly.
Listen, I'd love to chat, but I must run.

-Thank you.
-Of course. Good luck.

I hope this business doesn't victimise you
the way it did Carlos.

What do you mean?

You know what it's like...

trying to weed out the liars
from the honest men.

In the end, Carlos trusted no one.
Not even his best friends.

-Hello.
<i>-Did I wake you?</i>

Who's this?

<i>You've got 45 minutes.</i>
<i>Time for a piss and a shower. Hurry up.</i>

I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me your name.

<i>Nova, Hank.</i>
<i>The Anarchist attack, remember?</i>

<i>You didn't sit on your ass.</i>
<i>You went out there and got the story.</i>

What do you want?

<i>The Gothic Knights bar, Robinson.</i>
<i>45 minutes.</i>

<i>And, hey, make sure there's film</i>
<i>in the camera this time, okay?</i>

Nothing personal.

You've seen too much.

<i>Señor</i> Agustin...

wants you dead.

-Did you confront Agustin?
-Of course. He got uptight...

claimed his private life
was nobody's business.

Sounds like he doesn't know
this girl is a killer.

He knows. He's hiding it.

-Conjecture.
-It all fits.

Who's Agustin's biggest rival? Nova.
Who did the terrorists attack? Nova.

Who benefits? Agustin.

-Talk about aggressive business practices.
-It's still all conjecture. We operate on facts.

I saw her at Nova's office. I saw her face.

You're a reporter. Your word isn't proof.

You need corroboration.

Nicola may be a bit overzealous at times,
but she has a point.

-Yes.
-Looking forward to seeing it.

-You'll have to excuse me.
-Thank you for your time.

Mr. Robinson? Manuel Pla.
I recognise you from TV.

-And the lovely...
-Marisa Perez. Marisa is my assistant.

-Pleasure.
-Congratulations.

Your company's fortunes
have really turned around.

Well, in part thanks to Mr. Robinson.
He made us famous.

And if we succeed on acquiring Intertel...

-Enjoy yourselves.
-Thank you.

Would you like a drink?

Sure. Scotch is great, thanks.

Hi.

How are things?

Fine. I mean, sure,
we're in a ratings slump right now...

but we'll turn it around.

I've met a few young reporters
with a lot of potential.

You look beautiful.

So, that's your date?

-Marisa? Yes, she's my intern.
-Is that what they call it now?

I miss you.

A lot.

Can we get together? Talk?

I've left some of my things at your place.

Well, come on by. Anytime.

I've got a story to cover.

Hey, I know you. TV.

It must have been scary.

-What's that?
-Alone, filming the Anarchists.

They weren't just angry young kids
with cap guns.

Top-of-the-line Uzis,
classic commando assault.

I'd say they had training, financing, backing.

Someone developed Anarchists Now.

And that someone is running the show.

I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

I'm a cop. Brechner, Interpol.

-On duty?
-Always, keeping an eye on things.

Don't want a repeat
of the Nova incident, do we?

Agent Brechner,
you mind if I ask you a few questions?

-You on duty?
-Always.

Why not?

You identified any of the anarchists?

We have our suspicions.
One of them is a woman.

-You know her name?
-Do you?

All right, I'll level with you: I have a story.

My bosses won't let me run it
until I get corroboration.

-If I show you a picture, can you confirm it?
-You can't name me.

Anonymous source.

What do you need?

Her name is Leila Krtolica.

Anarchy Now's aim is to create chaos...

to destabilise governments,
eventually create a new world order.

Businesses represent capitalism to them,
their most hated enemy.

Already this year they've claimed 28 victims.

Leila made Interpol's most-wanted in June.

-Now she's in Spain.
-But what's her connection to Agustin?

Terrorists need funding.

It's hard to blow up bombs
on an empty stomach.

You tell me Eloy Agustin is a sponsor
of terrorism?

According to my Interpol source.
They've been watching him for years.

Looks like you've got
your corroboration, Nicola.

Okay, Robinson. Impress me.

<i>What is the connection between</i>
<i>Anarchy Now operative Leila Krtolica...</i>

<i>and EIoy Agustin of Intertel?</i>

<i>Recently, Krtolica assassinated</i>
<i>the President of Nova...</i>

<i>Agustin's greatest rival.</i>

<i>Coincidence?</i>

Señor <i>Agustin has denied any connection</i>
<i>with any terrorist group...</i>

<i>and maintains he is the victim of a frame-up.</i>

Cut.

-Thoughts?
-Not bad.

Careful. You don't want
to hurt yourself praising.

You did your job.
What do you want, a cookie?

We'll lead with it tonight. Happy?

Jesus, Veronica,
I thought you were looking for...

-So what are you doing here?
-I told you, I left some things behind.

You weren't home. I still have my key.

Which reminds me.

So long, Hank.

I'm sorry. I'm just...

Sorry, I'm a little high-strung lately.

I saw your report tonight.

-You watch Vision TV?
-Only when you're on.

-And?
-You did good. I'm happy for you.

Thanks.

Careful, Hank.

<i>I am humbled by the trust I've been given</i>
<i>in being appointed Nova's new CEO.</i>

<i>I vow to lead Nova</i>
<i>and its new acquisitions...</i>

<i>with integrity and vision,</i>
<i>into a prosperous future.</i>

<i>In the furore following the allegations</i>
<i>surrounding Eloy Agustin last week...</i>

<i>Intertel stockholders voted unanimously</i>
<i>to sell their company to Manuel Pla.</i>

Señor <i>Agustin, meanwhile...</i>

<i>is under investigation</i>
<i>by the Chief Magistrate's office.</i>

<i>This is Hank Robinson with Vision TV</i>
<i>signing off.</i>

Didn't your father ever teach you
to keep your powder dry?

Your story on Agustin caused quite a stir.

I've had the Chief Magistrate
on the line all morning.

Just the result of good journalism,
I guess, sir.

Yes. Free publicity is priceless.

Actually, I was thinking more
about the social value.

We exposed killers.

Ever wonder what a limey like me
was doing in Spain?

I love it.

Still virgin territory, pure.
It's waiting to be developed.

The rest of Europe is so cynical.
It's too knowing.

And together we going to make this city
the centre for world news.

And I have faith in you.

We're onto something wonderful.

You can't learn to be a journalist
from a book.

Didn't they teach you anything at school?

Yes. We had a saying.

"Believe nothing of what you hear,
and half of what you see."

That's a good motto.

Hello?

Yes, he is. Hold, please.

You've got a call on Line 1.

Thank you.

Hello.

<i>Good morning, partner.</i>

<i>Caught your piece last night. Good job.</i>

You going to give me your name this time?

<i>Call me Crusader.</i>

Okay, Crusader...

how did you know that Agustin
was sponsoring terrorism?

<i>A magician never explains his tricks.</i>

Listen...

why me?

<i>You're a rising star, Hank. You could go far.</i>

<i>I look forward to working with you</i>
<i>for a very long time.</i>

Listen, how do I get a hold of you
if I need you?

You were handed the story
on a silver platter.

-What are you complaining about?
-I don't trust him, or like him.

You're beginning to sound
like Carlos Aribau.

He thought his sources
were cooking up stories.

What?

Okay, I know what this is about:
fear of success.

You're on the verge
of surpassing your father...

-and the thought of it scares you.
-Bullshit.

Just do your job!

Here, another early story by Carlos Aribau.

Anything interesting?

The usual. Local news,
some crimes, some human interests.

You're a walking encyclopaedia, Marisa.
Listen...

-how did Aribau make it big?
-I heard, out of nowhere, he got a lead.

Something really big.

Out of nowhere?

Aribau had a secret source.
He never revealed who it was.

Probably never knew.

After that big story that make him famous...

he was offered a job at Vision TV,
and the rest is history.

Yeah, what was it? That first big job?

Industrial espionage.

Some telecommunications companies has
been accused of violating antitrust laws.

Aribau would champion their cause
and prove their innocence.

I was in high school,
but I remember it was a big deal at the time.

Manuel Pla.

Manuel Pla would have been ruined,
but Aribau saved him.

The attack on Nova, Agustin's downfall.
Over and over...

Pla benefited.

<i>Señor</i> Agustin?

<i>Señor</i> Agustin, we need to talk.

This is my home.

For 20 years!
I founded this company, and you...

-You took it away!
-We were set up.

The both of us.
Now, how did you meet the girl?

She came up to me, at the conference.

She was interested!

You are a man.

A woman that beautiful is interested in you,
do you chase her away?

She said you wanted me dead.

And you believed it. You, the great reporter!

I made a mistake.

I've been in business for a very long time.
This isn't over yet.

Tell me what you know.

I asked my own questions,
hired my own investigators.

Leila is no anarchist. She's no terrorist.

She's a cold, methodical killer.

-She'll kill for you if the price is right.
-Are you telling me she's a mercenary?

The Americans have a term
for people like her.

They call them "security contractors."

-Who hired her? Manuel Pla?
-Pla?

-Only a fool. Others behind him.
-Tell me who, <i>Señor</i> Agustin. Tell me.

God, it's them. You brought them here!

<i>Señor</i> Agustin.

No!

You did all you could, Mr. Robinson.
You are a hero.

A hero would have saved him.

Two assailants, one male, one female.

Anything you can remember about them?

They had on, what do you call it?
The motorcycle mask.

I'm sorry. One moment, please.

-Robinson.
<i>-Don't say another word.</i>

Are you all right?

<i>-Everything is fine.</i>
-Yeah, everything is fine.

<i>-It's an important call.</i>
-It's an important call.

Take your time.

Listen, you son of a bitch, I am onto you.
You set up Agustin.

<i>Don't be so melodramatic.</i>
<i>Take a deep breath, calm down.</i>

I am coming after you. Do you understand?

<i>I don't exist, Hank. I'm a whisper,</i>
<i>a breath on the other end of the line.</i>

You set up Agustin and you set me up.
You want me dead next?

<i>I do hope it doesn't come to that.</i>
<i>I'm enjoying our relationship.</i>

<i>I have many, many more stories to tell you.</i>

You can't manipulate me.
I'm not Carlos Aribau.

<i>No, you're worse.</i>

<i>Carlos never stepped on corpses</i>
<i>to get a story.</i>

-McGovern.
-Hank!

-Have you been in an accident?
-Listen to me. Agustin has been murdered.

He was strangled,
and left hanging like a piece of meat.

-Murdered?
-Yes.

-Are you sure?
-Yes.

-The police are calling it suicide.
-What?

They found a note in his home,
and there is an eyewitness.

What are you talking about?
That's insane. I saw it, I was there.

All right, Hank, I believe you...

but this is a news service.

You'll never get this past Nicola
without proof.

Markham.

What time did it happen?

Take it easy.

I got some bad news. It's about Agustin--

Feeling the unyielding hand of the law
closing in on him...

and filled with remorse
over his terrorist activity...

he lynched himself.

McGovern scooped you.

But...

how did he know?

Veronica?

<i>Okay, come on, everybody, run!</i>

<i>Give me the fucking gun!</i>

Veronica, hi, it's me.

Listen, can you meet me at the station?

So, Hank, how are they treating you
at Vision TV? Good?

-Can't complain.
-Do you get overtime? 'Cause we don't.

-Pedro.
-Did they give you an assistant?

-Yeah.
-Is she a babe?

Pedro, the tape.

Well, the tracking's screwed up.

-Was the camera damaged in any way?
-Well...

We could dump both picture and sound
on a computer...

and run a component program.

I've got just the thing for that.

The computer
would digitally adjust the tracking.

It could clean up over 90%
of your sound and image.

-How long is that going to take?
-A day.

Do it.

Now, about your assistant?

Okay, Pedro. Thank you very much.

She's a slave master.
You're lucky you escaped when you did.

Let me see if I understand.
The Anarchy Now attack...

it was all a ploy to disguise Sert's murder.

They killed the president of Nova
so that Manuel Pla could take over...

and they framed Agustin
so Pla could control Intertel, right?

You were a witness. You saw everything.

-Why didn't you expose them?
-I didn't know what I had.

The first time I looked at the tape,
it looked like a bunch of static.

What do you mean, "the first time"?

You shot this, didn't you?

Whose tape is this?

Carlos Aribau's.

Veronica, come on!

You robbed a dead man.
Have you no shame?

The cops. They examined the tape.

-Why didn't they catch this?
-Because I gave them a dub.

-Okay? I kept the original. I hid it.
-They are going to crucify you.

-Why? Why did you do it?
-Because...

all my life...

I was living in my father's shadow.
All my life, I wanted to...

I just...

I just wanted to be the best,
I just wanted to please. It was there.

I saw it. It was in my hand, I just took it.

I just did it.

Okay? I just took it.

I'm not this guy.

I'm not.

Marisa.

Good luck.

Mr. McGovern?

I bet you think you're quite the hotshot.

Is there a problem, sir?

You, Robinson, and your story.

Your story on Agustin put us
at the top of the ratings.

Congratulations.

I know someone who's going to be very
happy with his Christmas bonus this year.

-Wow. Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

You know, maybe as a follow-up,
you should do a story on Nova.

You know, how Manuel Pla saved
the company after the terrorist attack...

and turned its fortunes around.

Fair and balanced, of course.

-Of course.
-Good.

An Agent Brechner from Interpol
called three times this morning.

"The Great Game."

It's a term the British used
during World War I for espionage.

They used people as game pieces
and the world as a board.

A board game. Kind of like Monopoly.

Except in Monopoly,
the game pieces don't die.

-Listen, Agustin was murdered.
-I know.

There's a new player in the game.

Leila's partner, Paul Wolf.

Six feet tall, German, very professional.

Listen, I've been getting calls,
anonymous tips.

I'm thinking this Wolf
may be using me somehow.

What?

As a patsy, to cover up his crimes.
I don't know.

Goddamn terrorists.

Now they've joined the media.

Why didn't you tell me sooner?

I'm a reporter. I was hoping for a scoop.

Don't be an idiot, Robinson.
These people will eat you for breakfast.

If they contact you again...

please, let me know. Day or night.

-Consider me...
-A friend?

I was going to say "ally."

Mr. Robinson?

I'm sorry. Miss Markham told me
to give this to you.

She wanted me to hand it to you directly.
She sounded very mysterious.

What is it?

The police report on Agustin's death.

Who's winning?

Would you get me another drink, please?

This is for VlPs only.
How did you get in here?

The security guard was female.
She was susceptible to my charm.

-Big fan, huh?
-He's going to foul.

Yeah.

This fax. One could draw
some startling conclusions.

-The forward centre is a star.
-The police reports Agustin's suicide...

-at five minutes to 1 1 :00 in the morning...
-You're ruining my game.

...after McGovern and I spoke.
McGovern knew about this.

Our boss is involved in this.

Agustin never stood a chance.

-I'm glad you're in this with me.
-No, you can count me out.

-These guys, they don't blush at much.
-You scared?

If you were going to sit it out,
why did you bait me?

You were hungry, out to get a name.
Here's a story, now go fetch it.

So, I get my head blown off,
and you sit behind your desk?

Hank, when you've seen what I've seen,
and you've lived what I've lived...

then you can judge me.

If I can help without exposing myself, I will.

But I don't intend on destroying myself
over this. It's not big enough.

See you at the water cooler, Nicola.

Hello, Mr. Robinson.

lmagine running into you here.

Relax. Perhaps we--

Yeah, but the only problem was
he didn't understand a word I was saying.

-Quite--
-So, what's the joke?

-Hank, good to see you.
-Nice to see you.

Tell us what our star reporter
has been up to.

What have I been up to?
Well, I was shot, chased, nearly killed.

All in a day's work, you know.
How about you?

Murder any competitors lately?

Hank, why don't I get you a drink?

Enjoy yourselves.

You've been reading
too many spy novels, Hank.

How did you know what was in Agustin's
police report before it was issued?

I have an amazingly good contact
in the Barcelona police force.

-Who?
-Hank!

A good reporter never reveals his sources.

-You're lying.
-Am I?

Truth is in the eye of the beholder.

There is only one absolute truth:

Truth is power.

The anarchist attack on Nova.

Orchestrated to remove an obstacle...

that stubborn old fool, Sert...

and put Manuel Pla in charge.

-Framing Agustin?
-Another obstacle removed.

Now, Pla has his finger in the Internet
and telecommunications pie.

Why are you doing this?

The Internet is dangerous.

It allows people to get information
they cannot be trusted with.

It must be controlled...

step by step.

Until, eventually, people like you
are running the whole show.

I'm wondering what the Chief Magistrate
is going to think about this.

Why don't we ask him?

He's one of my guests.
He's right down there, see?

I believe you've already made
his acquaintance.

Of course, we will have to tell him the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...

including your pilfering of the Aribau story.

Oh, yes, I knew all along.

That's why I hired you.

Well, we're the same, you and I.

Unbound by petty moral concepts
of good and evil...

we see what has to be done, and we do it.

-Men like us rule the world.
-No.

Yes.

We are governed only by our desires.

Me, it's power.

For you, I'd say respect.

Look, the crime is not
stealing the story, son.

The crime is getting caught.

So, why don't we join the party?

There are some people
I'd really like you to meet.

They, too, have done what it takes.

Manuel Pla: Triumph over Adversity.

I'm a whore.

<i>-Mr. Robinson, you have a call on Line 1.</i>
-Thank you.

-Robinson.
<i>-It's me. We cleaned up the tracking.</i>

-God, Hank. It's horrible.
-All right. Play it.

<i>Stop it! It's enough!</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Did you have to make such a scene?</i>

<i>Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?</i>
<i>Nobody will suspect me.</i>

<i>He saw what we wanted him to see.</i>

<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

These people are savages.
We have to broadcast this, Hank.

Oh, God. All right, don't do anything yet.
Just give me a little time, all right?

Okay.

Important call?

Don't you knock?

So what's the plan?

The plan?

Well, I thought I'd finish my puff piece
on Manuel Pla...

go down to the local watering hole,
get shit-faced, and try and get laid.

Yesterday, you were going
to change the world.

-Well, I thought better that.
-So you're going to do nothing?

You're the one that wanted to leave it alone.

So it's people like you and me
that help McGovern get away with murder.

Listen to Hank, Jr.! You and your daddy
are cut from the same cloth.

-Let's leave my father out of it.
-No, I don't think so.

It must have been tough growing up
in the great man's shadow.

But let me cut him down to size for you.

You know his great book: Howard Robinson
covers the Islamic revolution...

that topples the Shah of Iran.

He backs it up with eyewitness accounts
of atrocities and mass murders.

Truth is, he spent most of his days
in the Tehran Hilton, shagging me.

Bullshit.

His stories were ripped off
from local Persian journalists...

most of whom, I might add,
did not survive the Ayatollah's purges.

No witness, no one to expose him.

What, nothing to say?

Hank, look on the bright side.
He would've been so proud of you.

No, with all due respect,
I think you're wrong.

No, you should lead with this,
then pick this up later.

-It is much stronger, believe me.
-Yes, okay.

Our report on <i>Señor</i> Pla.

-Fair and balanced, I hope.
-Just like you asked for.

Good lad.

You know, Nicola, I think our Hank
is beginning to tire of Barcelona.

Perhaps we should find
a more interesting spot for him.

Baghdad, say, or Kabul?

-I'm so sorry, Archie.
-No, it's my fault. Really.

-I'm such a klutz!
-It's all right.

-No problem.
-Sorry.

-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

You two need a coffee break.

Now.

Just wanted to let you know
that we're going to do a story on you.

One I think you'll be rather pleased with.

Well, let me see.

"Computer genius...

<i>"and Internet pioneer."</i>

Wait.

<i>"Legendary entrepreneur."</i>

When we are finished, the whole world
will want to get into bed with you.

The sky is the limit.

Robinson is a good dog.
He'll fetch and do as he's told.

Besides, it would be rather unfortunate
to have to...

put down another journalist.

Nicola! My turn to run into you.

Any special plans tonight?

Those are top secret.

-Is it Chanel you're wearing?
-Archie!

-Who's the lucky man?
-I'll never tell.

Do I know him?

You'll never get away with this, you know.

Dating fellow employees
is against company regulations.

Okay, I'll quit.

-Look, let me give you a ride.
-No, thanks, Archie.

-You're not going my way. Bye.
-Goodbye.

<i>I'm so sorry, Archie.</i>

Nicola, you sneaky little devil.

Nicola!

-I had the story in my hands.
-All right.

I loved your father.

I'll nail them to a wall. I swear to you.

What are you waiting for?

Impress me.

Brechner. Listen, they killed her, okay?

Nicola. They killed Nicola.

Meet me at 7tv, all right? We end this now.

Robinson!

-Hank, what happened?
-Don't ask.

-Listen, is the tape set?
-Yes, we can broadcast...

-from the studio right now.
-Okay.

Brechner.

Go round back.
Make sure the rats don't escape.

I'm calling the cops.

-Hello.
-Hey, how are you doing?

-Brechner.
-No, no, no.

Call me Crusader. Yeah, that's it.

-He's on his cell phone.
-Keep him talking.

If I can find his frequency,
we can broadcast it from the studio.

-Listen, maybe we can cut a deal. All right?
<i>-I'm afraid not, pal.</i>

<i>You're not working out as we had hoped.</i>
<i>Your resignation is required.</i>

<i>-I even convinced McGovern to recruit you.</i>
-I've got his frequency.

I followed you for a week
after the Nova incident.

You never showed
any sign of remorse, not once.

I said, "This is our guy!"

<i>I even cleaned up after you.</i>
<i>Remember Joaquim?</i>

A few drops of hydrochloric acid
in a glass of beer...

problem solved, if you know what I mean.

-Nicola?
-An injection. Straight to the aorta.

Melts away the protective cardiac tissue.

Looks just like a heart attack,
don't you think?

<i>Very clean.</i>

Hey, that's my set.

<i>Hank, I had help. You helped me.</i>

They are all dead because of you.

<i>You endangered their lives</i>
<i>just so you could get one step closer.</i>

<i>To what, Hank? The top?</i>

<i>Greed. So ugly, isn't it, Hank?</i>

<i>I may have done the deed,</i>
<i>but you sure made it easy.</i>

-Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
-Now, now, now, Hank!

You should be thanking me.

You're not dead. The only reason
you're still alive is because...

I've allowed you to.

-Why don't you go to hell?
<i>-Maybe I will.</i>

But after you, my friend.
And Hank, when you get there...

say hi to Carlos Aribau.

Hello.

I don't think so.

You know, this is the second time
I've had to hold a gun to your head.

You remember.

I think I've let you live long enough.

God damn it!

This is so sweet.

Interpol. Everything is all right.

What?

Good thing your friend Pedro
called the police...

when he saw your impromptu broadcast.

We've been tracking these two for months.

So he was using your identity as a cover,
and you've been...

-following me to get to him.
-Well, I'm sorry.

-Excuse me. I got to go.
-Yeah.

-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I've been better.

I'm sorry.

The tape will destroy Pla. It's finally over.

Not quite.

<i>Did you have to make such a scene?</i>

<i>Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?</i>
<i>Nobody will suspect me.</i>

<i>He saw what we wanted him to see.</i>

<i>The evidence of the released videotape</i>
<i>led to the immediate arrest of Manuel Pla.</i>

The damning video was shot by...

journalist Carlos Aribau and his cameraman.

I stole it.

I apologise to them...

and to you.

As journalists, we have all taken
a sacred oath...

to report nothing but the truth.

But sometimes...

in the mad race for glory and ratings...

we forget our promise.

It's then your duty to remind us...

to keep us vigilant, to keep us honest...

to keep us fair.

Because in the end...

you get the press you deserve.

This is Hank Robinson for Vision TV...

signing off.

What are you all staring at?
Get back to work!

What the hell do you think you've done?

By ruining me, you've only achieved
your own destruction, son.

I'm not your son,
I have a father, you piece of shit.

-Don't--
-Temper, McGovern.

You don't want us to add assault
to the other charges.

Not that it would make much difference.

-Take care, Mr. Robinson.
-Thank you.

Hey, Marisa.

That motto from your class. What was it?

"Believe nothing of what you hear
and only half of what you see."

Words to the wise.

That's for you.

Thank you.

-Mr. Robinson.
-Yeah?

Can I get my old job back?

I'll think about it.
