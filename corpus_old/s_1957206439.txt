Man: TODD, HOW DOES IT
FEEL TO HAVE

ALL OF THE EXPERTS
PICKING YOU

TO GO FIRST
IN THE DRAFT?

BROKE, FROM BRIBING
ALL THOSE EXPERTS.

NO, NO,
I'M JUST PLAYING.

NO, SERIOUSLY,
I'M HONORED

THAT PEOPLE LOVE
MY GAME THAT MUCH.

BUT THERE WILL BE
A LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS

IN THE DRAFT TOMORROW,

AND THE FIRST PICK
COULD BE ANYBODY.

NOW, TODD,
YOU WERE RAISED

IN THE GHETTO,
THE HOOD,

DRAGGED UP
IN THE STREETS

AFTER YOUR FATHER
ABANDONED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.

MY DAD NEVER LEFT.
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

THIS IS MY DAD.

NO GOVERNMENT
CHEESE?

NO WELFARE?

NO.

MY PARENTS
WORKED VERY HARD

TO PAY THE BILLS
AND KEEP CLOTHES ON MY BACK.

SO, MR. AND MRS.
ANDERSEN,

ONCE TODD IS SELECTED
IN THE DRAFT,

HE STANDS
TO MAKE MILLIONS.

DO YOU THINK THINGS WILL
CHANGE FOR YOUR FAMILY?

WE'RE A DOWN-HOME
KIND OF PEOPLE.

WE RAISED TODD
TO KNOW

THAT FAMILY VALUES

ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MONEY.

WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOLISM,

DRUG ABUSE,
THE SMOKE, THE DRINK?

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE?

NO?

ANYTHING?

TOMORROW
WILL PROBABLY BE

A HISTORICAL DAY
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON CELEBRATING?

WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE IT
THE WAY THE ANDERSENS

HAVE ALWAYS CELEBRATED
FOR GENERATIONS.

WE'RE HAVING
A FAMILY...

COOKOUT!
COOKOUT!
COOKOUT!

WELL, THAT'S ALL
OUR TIME FOR NOW.

TODD, MR. AND MRS.
ANDERSEN, THANK YOU.

AND GOOD LUCK
TOMORROW IN THE DRAFT.

FOR SPORTS TIME,
I'M A.C. CHARLES.

AND I'M
PEARCE GABRIEL.

GOOD NIGHT.

WHAT WAS THAT?
WHO THE...

YOU CAN STOP
ALL THAT SMILING.

THE CAMERA'S OFF.

THE CAMERA
LOVES ME, WOMAN.

I OUGHT TO HAVE
MY OWN TV SHOW.

HOW WAS I?

I DIDN'T COME OFF
TOO STIFF, DID I?

SANFORD AND JOJO.

JOJO AND THE SEX.

NO, BABY,
YOU WERE FINE.

YOU GO ON UP
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

YOU GOT A BIG DAY
TOMORROW.

EVERYBODY
LOVES JOJO.

I GOT IT! AH!

WHO WANTS
TO MARRY JOJO?

I GOT A PERFECT SHOW
FOR YOU, JOJO.

HUH?

JACKASS.

I DO NOT CARE
WHAT IT TAKES.

THERE IS NO WAY
HE'S GOING TO NEW JERSEY.

YO, DUDE, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
THE NUMBER-ONE PICK,

AND THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

I WANT HIM TAKING US
TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

AND HE CAN'T DO THAT
ANYWHERE ELSE. IS THAT CLEAR?

TODD ANDERSEN IS COMING
TO DALLAS. ARE WE STRAIGHT?

GET HIS ASS HERE.

Marv Albert: WE ARE
IN NEW YORK CITY,

THE MECCA
OF PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL,

WHERE LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN MADE.

LIVE FROM MADISON
SQUARE GARDEN,

IT'S THE 38th ANNUAL
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL DRAFT,

WHERE THE NEXT CROP
OF YOUNG SUPERSTARS,

LED BY 3-TIME ALL-AMERICAN
TODD ANDERSEN OUT OF RUTGERS,

WILL TAKE THAT NEXT STEP
INTO THE PROFESSIONAL RANKS.

HI, EVERYBODY. I'M MARV ALBERT
HERE ON THE FLOOR

WITH A COUPLE
OF THE GAME'S BEST--

ELTON BRAND
AND BARON DAVIS.

NOW, ELTON,
IS THIS KID TODD ANDERSEN

AS GOOD AS THE HYPE,

AND CAN HE TURN AROUND
A FRANCHISE?

WELL, MARV,
IF NEW JERSEY SELECTS

TODD ANDERSEN WITH
THE NUMBER-ONE PICK,

THEY'LL BE GETTING A KID
WITH TONS OF POTENTIAL.

GUYS THAT ARE IN THE PROS
LIKE MYSELF, BARON DAVIS,

WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT THIS KID HAS

AND REALLY WANT
TO TAKE IT TO HIM.

A CANDID STATEMENT
FROM ONE OF THE GAME'S BEST.

NOW, BARON, DOES NEW JERSEY
KEEP THAT NUMBER-ONE PICK

AND TAKE TODD ANDERSEN?

THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF RUMORS CIRCULATING

THAT MARK CUBAN
WANTS TO MOVE UP

AND TAKE TODD ANDERSEN
WITH THE NUMBER-ONE PICK.

AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN
MARK CUBAN WANTS SOMETHING,

HE USUALLY GETS IT.

SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

YES, IT IS
ALWAYS INTERESTING

TO SEE IF CUBAN'S
WHATEVER-IT-TAKES ATTITUDE

PAYS OFF.

WE'RE JUST MOMENTS AWAY

FOR THE DOORS TO SWING OPEN
FOR THE LEAGUE'S FUTURE STARS.

NEW JERSEY
IS ON THE CLOCK.

WE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT
FIRST PICK AFTER THESE WORDS.

I GOT TO USE
THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST RELAX? NOW COME ON.

YOU'RE GONNA BE
FINE, ALL RIGHT?

TODD, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS HERE TODAY,

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE NUMBER ONE

IN ME AND YOUR DADDY'S EYES.
YOU HEAR ME?

THAT'S RIGHT.

WHOO!

SORRY I'M LATE.

I HAD TO PUT ON MY FACE

IN CASE THERE'S ANY CAMERAS
OR ANYTHING.

BABY, DO YOU LIKE MY SHOES?
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEM?

I THINK THAT I NEEDED
A REALLY NICE PAIR OF HEELS,

AND THESE GOT THE LITTLE
STILETTO THING GOING ON. CUTE?

VERY ODD, HONEY,

BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

OH. WELL...

SO MUCH TIME

FOR US TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

YOU SHOULD BE
SO PROUD OF YOUR SON.

HE IS AMAZING.

HE IS GOING TO BE
A BIG, RICH BASKETBALL PLAYER.

MWAH!

SPENDING YOUR MONEY.

MAMA, I'M GONNA BE FINE.

I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH WES.

HE SAID I'LL BE WORTH
MORE THAN $50 MILLION

WHEN MY CONTRACT GOES THROUGH

"WHEN."
DON'T YOU MEAN "IF"?

WHAT IF YOU

YOU THINK IT'S GONNA
BE ALL GOOD THEN?

AND WHAT'S THIS GIRL

TALKING ABOUT
"BOUGHT USA HOUSE"?

THAT GIRL

COME ON NOW.

THE BOY JUST
MOVED IN HERE.

COME ON NOW.

IT'S COOL, MA.
THIS HOUSE IS FOR ALL OF US.

HAVING THE COOKOUT HERE
WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA.

MATTER OF FACT,
LET'S HAVE IT THIS SATURDAY.

EXCU--EXCUSE ME.

IS THAT
A PURPLE DIAMOND?

OH. WHY, YES, IT IS.
YOU GUYS LIKE?

IT'S SOMETHING THAT ME
AND TODD PICKED UP.

OH, YOU GUYS, LOOK.

I HAVE MATCHING
EARRINGS, TOO.

OH, YEAH. YEAH,
THEY'RE REALLY NICE.

TODD, COME ON.
WE GOT TO TALK.

OK. MA, LOOK, YOU'RE
IN CHARGE, RIGHT?

DO YOUR THING.

THE TIP FROM THE CROWLEYS
WAS CORRECT.

I HAVE A VISUAL
ON THE SUSPECTS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT AM I DOING?

THIS HOUSE, THE CARS,
THE JEWELRY, THE BRITTANY.

YOU CAN'T AFFORD
ANY OF THIS STUFF.

WES, WES, WES, WES.

I JUST GOT
$30 MILLION, MAN.

I'M RICH!

IT'S $30 MILLION,

BUT IT'S $30 MILLION
SPREAD OVER 6 YEARS.

YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
A PAYCHECK YET.

THE SEASON DOESN'T START
FOR ANOTHER 3 MONTHS.

HEY, I AM NOT FRONTING YOU
THE CASH FOR THIS STUFF, OK?

HA HA. WES, WHY ARE
YOU BUGGING, MAN?

LET ME ENJOY
THE MOMENT.

ENJOY THE MOMENT,
BUT RETURN THIS CRAP.

YEAH. AT LEAST UNTIL

I CAN OFFICIALLY LOCK IN
SOME ENDORSEMENTS FOR YOU.

PEOPLE JUST SAW ME
ON NATIONAL TV

GETTING DRAFTED
THE OTHER DAY.

NOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO SEE ME RETURNING

THOUSAND OF DOLLARS'
WORTH OF STUFF

LIKE I SMOKED UP
ALL MY MONEY?

I'M NOT
A CRACKHEAD, WES.

YOU NEED TO GET ME SOME
ENDORSEMENTS OR SOMETHING.

ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET THEM,

BUT JUST HOLD OFF
FOR A WHILE, OK?

I MEAN, JUST THINK
ABOUT IT, PLEASE.

YO! WHO THAT?

EXCUSE ME.
CAN I HELP YOU?

OK, OK, OK, BUDDY.

JUST REMAIN CALM.
JUST CALM DOWN.

SUBJECT IS BEING
BELLIGERENT.

MAY HAVE TO SUBDUE
WITH CHOKE HOLD. REQUEST BACKUP.

YO, WHAT THE HELL?

ARE YOU OK, SIR?

JUST BLINK ONCE
IF YES.

I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

IS HE FORCING YOU
TO SAY THAT?

NO.

I LIVE HERE.
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

YEAH, RIGHT, YOU LIVE HERE.
NEGRO, PLEASE.

LOOK, I GOT KEYS--

HOLD IT!

DON'T! DON'T!

I'LL SPRAY YOUR ASS.

PLEASE DON'T
SPRAY HIS ASS.

LADY, LADY, THIS
IS HIS HOUSE.

THIS IS
TODD ANDERSEN,

NEW JERSEY'S
NUMBER-ONE PICK.

I'LL LIGHT HIS ASS UP.
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

OH, THAT IS YOU, HUH?

YEAH.

YOU LOOK YOUNGER
IN PERSON.

HOW YOU DOING?

GOOD. I'M GOOD,
ACTUALLY.

WELL, LOOK HERE.
WE DON'T PLAY

THAT GHETTO NONSENSE
AROUND HERE.

NO CHICKEN HEADS,
NO HOOD RATS,

NO 40-OUNCERS,

NO RIMS-ON SPINNERS,

AND NO LOUD MUSIC.

THIS AIN'T NO LUDACRIS
VIDEO SET.

AND KEEP THEM HO'S AWAY.

YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY CHICKEN HEADS

OR HO'S, DO YOU?

NOW YOU WANT TO MOVE
TO YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE?

IT'S LOOKING A LOT
BETTER, ISN'T IT?

THIS IS WHAT YOU GOT TO
DEAL WITH OUT IN THE...

OH, SHE GOT THE BIBLE.

WHAT IS THIS?

GARDEN RIDGE ESTATES
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

ALL 4 VOLUMES.

I SUGGEST
YOU LEARN THEM.

YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?
I'M SORRY TO STARTLE YOU.

YOU HAVE
A LOVELY DAY.

YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.

THANKS
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

I GOT MY EYE ON YOU.

OOH...

I STILL SEE YOU.

YOU FEEL SAFE NOW?

YEAH. I'M GREAT.

COME ON NOW.
COME ON.

BE CAREFUL WITH
THEM BOXES NOW, BABY.

YO, MA, THIS IS DOPE!
YOU DID YOUR THING IN HERE!

YOU LIKE IT, BABY?

YEAH, I LIKE IT!
THIS IS CRAZY!

I'M GLAD
YOU LIKE IT.

COME GIVE
YOUR MAMA A KISS.

WHOO!

MWAH!

THANK YOU,
MOMMY.

LOOK HERE.

YOU SEE HOW YOUR MAMA
PUT ALL YOUR PICTURES

UNDER THE GLASS?

THIS WAY, YOU CAN LOOK
AT ALL YOUR PICTURES

AT ONE TIME.

CHECK THIS OUT, MAN.

OK, LOOK. THIS IS MY COUSIN
LEROY RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?

HE FAILED THE BAR
9 TIMES.

STILL GIVES
LEGAL ADVICE.

RIGHT.

OH, LOOK. AND THERE GOES
JASPER AND JEROME.

THEY ARE REAL COUNTRY.

WHO'S THIS LITTLE
GIRL RIGHT HERE

WITH THE FUNNY-
LOOKING TEETH?

OH, THAT'S
MY BEST FRIEND--BECKY.

YEAH.
OH, THAT'S BECKY.

AND LOOK HERE.
NOW THAT'S THEM

IN THE TUB.

WHOA. CHILL.
WE WAS JUST COOL.

IT WASN'T EVEN
LIKE THAT.

YO, BUT I WONDER IF THOSE
BRACES EVER FIXED HER TEETH.

YOU SEEN HER?

WHY? SO BOTH OF YOU

CAN TAKE A SPLISH-SPLASH
IN YOUR BRAND-NEW TUB?

OH, COME ON, BABY.
IT WASN'T EVEN LIKE THAT.

STOP. STOP. COME ON.

COME ON NOW. THAT'S
ENOUGH OF ALL OF THAT.

COME ON. WE'RE GOING
TO SEE THE BEDROOM.

YOU, COME ON.

MY OLD
BEDROOM SET!

OH!

YOUR MOTHER THOUGHT
IT MIGHT HELP EASE

YOUR TRANSITION FROM MOVING
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

THANK YOU, MOM.

MWAH!

OH, LOOK.

LITTLE KIDDIE,
SPORTY...

BED SHEETS. YAY!

AIN'T THEY THE BOMB?

MAYBE WE CAN
JUST WEAR

THE MATCHING LITTLE
KIDDIE PAJAMAS

WITH IT, TOO.

WHOO.

I'D RATHER BE DEAD
THAN SLEEP IN THIS.

VROOM!

[TELEPHONE RINGING]

HELLO.

Wes: HEY, HONEY.
IS TODD THERE?

TODD.

TODD.


TODD, GET UP!

WHAT? WHAT?

THE PHONE
IS FOR YOU.

WHAT'S...HELLO.

HEY, TODD.
IT'S ME--WES.

YOU AWAKE, BUDDY?
I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

COME ON. GET YOUR BUTT
OUT OF BED.

WHAT'S UP, MAN?

CYNTHIA PETERS, THE HEAD
OF STONE MOUNTAIN WIRELESS,

IS INTERESTED IN MEETING YOU
FOR AN ENDORSEMENT.

FOR REAL?

YES! SHE WANTS
TO MEET YOU A.S.A.P.

WHAT? ARE YOU
TOO BUSY?

NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M AVAILABLE.

I CAN DO IT.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

YES, I'M SERIOUS!

I'M GONNA HAVE HER COME
BY YOUR HOUSE SATURDAY MORNING.

YO, LISTEN, MAN.
WHENEVER SHE CAN DO IT,

I'M HERE.
JUST DO IT.

WE'LL DO THE MEETING

FIRST THING SATURDAY MORNING
WITH MS. PETERS.

THEN YOU HAVE THE REST
OF THE AFTERNOON

FOR THE COOKOUT
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

I'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY.
YOU'RE RICH! YOU'RE RICH!

OK, BYE. BYE.
BABY, THAT WAS WES.

STONE MOUNTAIN
WIRELESS

IS CONSIDERING ME
AS A SPOKESPERSON

FOR THEIR FAMILY
TIME CAMPAIGN.


OH, MAN!

WHOO! ONE OF THE REPS
IS COMING OVER THIS SATURDAY

TO MEET ME, BABY.

OH.

YO, WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH ALL MY MOM'S STUFF?

OH, BABY, LOOK.

EVERYTHING THAT
YOUR MOM TRIED TO DO

WAS REALLY GREAT
AND EVERYTHING,

BUT I JUST THINK
THAT IT WAS

A LITTLE BIT
TOO DOWN-HOME,

AND BABY, WHAT YOU NEED
IS A HIP, PROGRESSIVE IMAGE.

FOCUS. FOCUS.

HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE HOUSE, OK?

MS. PETERS IS GONNA
BE HERE ANY SECOND.

YOU NEED TO SELL HER
ON YOU.

ON YOU, BABE.

OK, LOOK.
WHATEVER IT TAKES

TO GET THIS DEAL.

BUT AS SOON AS SHE LEAVES,
I WANT ALL THIS STUFF

BACK THE WAY IT WAS
BEFORE MY MOM GETS HERE.

AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RETURN THIS.

NO! THAT COCK COST ME
A LOT OF MONEY TO GET.

YOU'VE GOT A GIANT COCK
IN YOUR KITCHEN.

IT'S RIDICULOUS.

BABY.

I MISS YOU.

I MISS YOU MORE.

I MISS YOUMORE.

LIL DEE?
WHO THE HELL IS LIL DEE?

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]


WHAT'S GOOD, CHIEF?

WHAT WAS THAT--
PUBLIC ENEMY?

ARE YOU ADDRESSING ME,
YOUNG MAN?

IF YOU ARE, IT IS
JUDGE HOLSTEAD CROWLEY,

NOT CHIEF.

HEY, MAN,
I'M TODD ANDERSEN,

YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR.
GOOD TO SEE

ANOTHER BROTHER IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, MAN.

BROTHER?

YOU'RE NOT ANY
RELATIONS OF MINE.

O...K.

I JUST WANTED
TO COME OVER HERE

AND INVITE YOU
TO A COOKOUT.

THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION,
BUT I WILL NOT BE COMING

TO YOUR...COOKOUT.

AND KEEP IT DOWN.


IT'S ONE THING FOR YOU
TO CALL ME OUT MY NAME.

IT'S A WHOLE
'NOTHER THING

FOR YOU TO CALL ME
SOME OTHER TRICK'S NAME.

DON'T MAKE ME BREAK THE GLASS.
I GOT TO GO.

I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.

[MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY]

HEY! YO! HEY! HEY!

WHOA! STOP!

I'LL DO
THE TALKING, MAN.

DO I LOOK GOOD?

YOU LOOK FAT.


STEP OUT OF THE CAR.

STEP OUT OF THE CAR?

I'M NOT STEPPING
OUT OF THE CAR.

YOU'RE A RENT-A-COP,
FOOL. HA HA!

A RENT-A-COP?

YEAH.

I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
I PASSED

THE MARKSMANSHIP EXAM
WITH A PERFECT SCORE.

I PASSED THE PHYSICAL
ENDURANCE TEST

IN RECORD TIME.

AND I PASSED
THE WRITTEN TEST

IN THE TOP
FIRST PERCENTILE.

THAT'S ALL THE WAY
AT THE TOP, OK?

NOW, JUST BECAUSE
I WASN'T ABLE

TO PASS SOME
PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAM

DON'T MEAN I DON'T
HAVE NO AUTHORITY.

I'LL BREAK THE GLASS
ON YOUR ASS.

SHE CRAZY.

NEXT TIME,
AT THE GATE, OK?

YEAH. HOW STUPID.

DON'T JUST
DRIVE THROUGH. STOP.

CARRY
YOUR DUMB ASSES ON.


MAN, LET'S GET
TO COUSIN TODD'S HOUSE, MAN.

HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS MAKING?

[EUROPEAN ACCENT]
WE DO NOT "MAKE."

HAM-FISTED
DAY LABOWERS MAKE.

LABOW-WHATS?

LABOWERS.
THE WORKERS.

WE ARE
ARTISTS, YES?

WE--POOF!--
CREATE.

THEY CREATE.

OK. SO, WHAT ARE
YOU CREATING?

PLEASE.

MMM!

AH! CK-CK-CK!

WHAT THE HECK
IS A LABOWER?

I DON'T KNOW.

JUST FOCUS, OK?
MS. PETERS IS--

[DOORBELL RINGS]

IS HERE.

LOOK. JUST BE COOL,
BE YOURSELF.

IF YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE LOSING HER,

TELL HER
SOME SOB STORY

ABOUT HOW HARD
LIFE WAS

GROWING UP
IN THE HOOD.

WHITE LIBERALS
LOVE "THE POOR KID

FROM THE GHETTO
DOING GOOD" RAP,

EVEN THOUGH IVERSON
ALMOST KILLED IT.

ALL RIGHT, RELAX, SMILE,
LOOK PRETTY.

HELLO, MS. PETERS.
COME ON IN.

MS. PETERS, IT IS SO NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

THE PLEASURE
IS ALL MINE.

I MUST SAY,

YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOME,
AND I ESPECIALLY LIKE

THE WAY YOU'VE
DECORATED IT.

THANK YOU.

YOU WERE TALKING
TO TODD. HA HA.

WES REILLY.
COME ON IN.

LET'S GET YOU
A NICE COLD BEVERAGE, OK?

[RAP MUSIC
PLAYING LOUDLY]

DID SOMEONE
JUST ASK

WHERE THEIR
BITCHES ARE?

[RAP MUSIC
PLAYING LOUDLY]

WHAT'S CRACKIN',
LACKEY COUSIN?

WILLIE, NELSON,

WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

SATURDAY. WE CAME
FOR THE COOKOUT.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

YO, MAN, WHERE
THE GRUBBLES AT?

WE GOT THE MUNCHIES
LIKE A MUG, MAN.

LOOK, MAN,
FORGET IT.

YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU?

NO. GO RIGHT AHEAD.

CHECK THIS OUT, BABY.
JUST LIKE...MMM.

THAT JUST TASTES,
LIKE, GOOD.

NOW, THAT IS GOOD.

LIKE A NICE PIECE
OF WHITE BREAD. MMM!

WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF BUTTER ON IT.

HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

OK, WES, WE'VE GOT TO
RESCHEDULE THIS MEETING.

NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

THEIR NEW AD CAMPAIGN
IS STARTING THIS WEEK.

WE'VE GOT TO
LOCK YOU IN TODAY.

NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T THINK

YOU QUITE
UNDERSTAND.

THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING.

TODD'S FAMILY
IS LIKE

THE BLACK BEVERLY
HILLBILLIES.

SO UNLESS SHE'S
TRYING TO SELL

PIG LIPS
AND SOME GOLD TEETH,

SHE'S NOT
GONNA WANT HIM.

YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT NONE OF THIS?

NO, NO. REALLY, I'M...

Brittany:
WILLIE, NELSON,

WHY DON'T YOU COME
OUTSIDE WITH ME?

I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

YOU AIN'T GOT TO
ASK ME TWICE.

Brittany: JUST FOLLOW ME.
AND GET UP.

ALL RIGHTIE, THEN.

SO, MS. PETERS--

NO NEED
FOR SMALL TALK, OK?

TODD IS GOOD-LOOKING.
HE'S CHARMING. HE'S LIKABLE.

HE COULD SELL AN ICE CUBE
TO AN ESKIMO.

I'M SURE HE CAN,

BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR A SALESMAN.

WHAT WE NEED IS
A YOUNG, ENTHUSIASTIC--

[LOUD CONVERSATION]

WHOA.

I SEE TODD DONE
MADE SOME CHANGES.

YEAH. WELL, IT
WAS ALL MY IDEA

FOR THE STYLE,

BUT I JUST
WANTED TO REALLY

CAPTURE
TODD'S TASTES.

OH, HOLD UP,
YOU GUYS.

NOW, I'M
THE TOUR.

CONGRATULATIONS
ON ALL YOUR NEW TASTE.

MOM, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MS. PETERS.

MS. PETERS
IS CONSIDERING ME

AS A SPOKESPERSON
FOR STONE MOUNTAIN PHONES.

YES.

NICE TO MEET YOU,
MS. PETERS.

YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE TODD.

HE'S QUITE
THE ACTOR.

EVEN IF HE DOESN'T
LIKE SOMETHING,

YOU'LL THINK
HE DOES.

HEY, GUESS WHO WE
MUST HAVE TALKED UP.

BECKY.

SHE STOPPED ME
IN THE GROCERY STORE.

I INVITED HER
TO THE COOKOUT.

OH, GREAT. I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE HER.

GOOD! GOOD!
BECKY'S COMING!

MORE VISITORS!
FANTASTIC!

HOW DOES SHE LOOK?

DID THE BRACES
DO ANYTHING FOR HER?

YOU'LL SEE
WHEN SHE GETS HERE.

YOU GUYS ARE STAYING
FOR THE COOKOUT, RIGHT?

WE'RE HAVING
A COOKOUT TODAY.

EXCUSE ME. I GOT TO GET
THAT GRILL RUNNING.

AND THIS IS OUR--
I MEAN TODD'S GARAGE.

WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

WOULDN'T MIND
PARKING IN THAT

EVERY DAY
OF THE WEEK. MAN!

YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

IS THAT TODD'S
BEDROOM SET?

UM...THAT'S
THE OLD ONE.

YOU SEE,
WE GOT A NEW ONE.

YOU KNOW, THIS
ENDORSEMENT IS JUST

REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR TODD AND I,

AND WE JUST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

THAT WE MADE
A GOOD IMPRESSION

ON MS. PETERS.

BRITTANY,
LISTEN, HONEY.

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE A BIG HIT

WITH THE FAMILY
AT THE COOKOUT?

REALLY?

NO, NO, NO.
A REALLY BIG HIT.

GOODY! A PROJECT?

WELL, WHAT CAN I DO?

OK. I WANT YOU TO RUN
UP TO TEANECK

AND GET ME A HAM
FOR MY GREENS.

WILL YOU DO THAT
FOR ME?

ISN'T TEANECK
LIKE AN HOUR AWAY?

YEAH, THAT'S
AN HOUR AWAY,

BUT THAT HAM
IS TODD'S FAVORITE.

AND LISTEN HERE.
IF YOU GO UP THERE

AND GET THAT NOW,

TODD MIGHT BUY YOU
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

YOU THINK SO?

I KNOW HE WILL.

THANK YOU, LADY EM.
ANYTHING THAT YOU SAY.

THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

THE ROOMS ARE UPSTAIRS.
POOL'S OUT BACK.

MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

AND TELL TODD
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

MWAH! MWAH!

UH-HUH. ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

THANK YOU.

YEAH, YOU
GO AHEAD ON NOW.

[CAR DOOR CLOSES,
ENGINE STARTS]

DUMB-ASS.

Wheezer: DOGGIE.
I SEE YOU, DOGGIE.

PRETTY DOGGIE.

YOU ARE PRETTY, DOGGIE.
I LOVE YOU, DOGGIE.

YO! GET YOUR ASS UP
OFF THE FLOOR!

HUH?

GET UP!

CAN I HELP YOU FELLAS?

AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU CAN.

LET ME GET THESE
CAKES AND, UM...

EVERYTHING
IN THE REGISTER!

I WANT CASH, COINS,

FOOD STAMPS,
EVERYTHING, MAN.

HEY, YO, BLING.

YOUR MAN IS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

NOT RIGHT NOW,
WHEEZE.

I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

IT'S A NICE PICTURE
OF HIM, TOO.

LET ME SEE THIS.

MR. BIG SHOT.

YEAH.
THIS IS GOOD.

WHERE CAN I FIND
THIS HOUSE RIGHT HERE?

DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE TODD KEEPS HIS LARD?

LARD?

OH, MY GOD.
OH, I FEEL DIZZY.

OLIVIER, MY TEMPLES--
RUB THEM VIGOROUSLY.

OH.

SEE WHAT
YOU HAVE DONE?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE--

WHO I AM?
YOU TELL HER WHO I AM.

OK. HE IS SVEN
FROM PRAGUE,

INTERNATIONALLY
RENOWNED MASTER CHEF--

MEIN CHEFMEISTER--

CHILD PRODIGY,

GRADUATE OF
LE CORDON BLEU

AT AGE 9.

NOW, HE IS FLUENT
IN THE CUISINE

OF OVER 100 NATIONS

AND KNOWN IN
THE CULINARY WORLD

AS THE PICASSO
OF PATE,

THE VAN GOGH
OF VEAL,

AND THE MICHELANGELO
OF MEAT.

VAN HOCK.

AND THIS IS
LADY EM OF NEWARK.

SHE HAS BEEN
CLEANING CHITTERLINGS

SINCE SHE WAS 6,

AND SHE IS KNOWN
THROUGHOUT THE HOOD

AS THE PATTI LABELLE
OF PORK,

THE BILLIE HOLIDAY
OF HOT LINKS,

THE ARETHA FRANKLIN
OF FRIED CHICKEN.

I CANNOT WORK LIKE THIS!

OLIVIER...

DRAMATIC EXIT.

[CLAP CLAP]

WAIT. WAIT. WHERE
ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

SVEN CANNOT WORK

UNDER
THESE CONDITIONS!

WHAT CONDITIONS?

THE WOMAN
IN THE KITCHEN,

THE PATTI LABELLE
OF PORK--

SHE IS THE COOLIO
OF CANNED MEAT.

I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER
RIGHT NOW, AND IT'LL BE FINE.

YOU GUYS, PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

OH, QUICKLY, GO.

THANK YOU.

AAH!
AAH!

THIS COUSIN TODD'S HOUSE?

HOW Y'ALL DOING?
WHAT'S UP, COUSIN TODD?

JASPER, JEROME,
WHY? WHY?

HERE'S YOUR HAM.

WHAT HAPPENED?

BABY, SVEN
AND OLIVIER LEFT.

THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COOK
BRUNCH FOR MS. PETERS.

WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

LOOK, I RAISED YOU
AND HALF YOUR COUSINS

ON MY COOKING.

NOW, IF IT'S GOOD
ENOUGH FOR THEM,

IT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR HER.

NOW, Y'ALL GET
THAT ANIMAL OUTSIDE

AND SKIN HIM.
GO AHEAD.

YOU'RE DROPPING BRAIN
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

YES, MA'AM.

THAT'S OUR HOMEMADE
SLIP-N-SLIDE.

PICK HIM UP.

HOMEMADE SLIP-N-SLIDE.

BRITTANY.

YES?

LOW-SODIUM HAM?

WHAT'S THIS, BABY?

IT'S HEALTHIER HAM,
AND IT'S BETTER FOR TODD

BECAUSE HE NEEDS
TO STAY IN SHAPE.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A HEALTHY COOKOUT IS?

NO, NO, NO. DON'T
ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

BECAUSE THERE'S
NO SUCH THING

AS A HEALTHY
COOKOUT.

LOOK AROUND
THIS COUNTER.

YOU SEE ANYTHING
HEALTHY?

LOOK AT THIS.

CHITTERLINGS--
SODIUM.

MACARONI AND CHEESE--
SODIUM.

GREENS--SODIUM,
BLACK-EYED PEAS--SODIUM,

POTATO SALAD--SODIUM.

SODIUM, SODIUM,
SODIUM! OK?

AND AS FOR TODD,

THAT BOY'S EATEN
SO MUCH SODIUM,

HE COULD CRAP
A SALT LICK.

DIDN'T KEEP HIM
OUT OF THE PROS,

NOW DID IT?

LITTLE BRITTANY,
I NEED A HAM.

AND I WANT THAT HAM
TO BE...WHAT?

SODIUM.

WITH SODIUM.

OK.

GOOD GIRL.

Ms. Peters: EXCUSE ME.

MAY I HAVE A GLASS OF--

WAH!

MS. PETERS!

HELP ME, JESUS.

QUICK NOW. AND DON'T FORGET
MY CAST-IRON POT,

BECAUSE LADY EM GONNA TRY
TO OUTDO MY CORNBREAD,

AS IF SHE COULD.

COME ON, MA.
WHY DOES EVERYTHING

BETWEEN YOU
AND AUNTIE EM

HAVE TO BE
A COMPETITION?

HONEY, THERE IS
NO COMPETITION,

BECAUSE I'M BETTER
THAN SHE IS.

NOW GET
IN THE HOUSE.

FRANK, SHAKE
A TAILFEATHER.

GIVE ME A HAND,
GRANDPA?

NOPE. MY HANDS ARE
ALREADY FILLED, SON.

HO. HO. HO.

STOP RIGHT THERE.

STOP, YOU, RIGHT THERE.

LOOK, CUT THE ENGINE OFF,

BUT DON'T TURN OFF THAT RECORD.
THAT'S MY JAM.

YO, I'M HERE
TO SEE TODD ANDERSEN.

OH, NO, I DON'T
THINK SO. HE'S OVER.

HE'S OVER? WHAT YOU MEAN?
HE LIVES HERE, DON'T HE?

WELL, SEE, REGULATION 42-B,
SUBSECTION 6, CLEARLY STATES

THAT RESIDENTS ARE ALLOWED
A LIMITEDNUMBER OF VISITORS.

YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

I CAN'T EVEN SEE
MY OWN COUSIN?

THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

LISTEN UP,
RENT-A-COP.

YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A GUN.

YOU HAVE A FLASHLIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

I DIDN'T DRIVE ALL THE WAY
UP HERE FOR NOTHING.

YOU SEE THESE BABIES
IN THIS CAR?

THEY NEEDS A DADDY.

A...BALLER. SWOOSH.

SO WHAT I'M GONNA
NEED YOU TO DO

IS RUN ON OVER

TO THAT LITTLE
PHONE BOOTH OVER THERE,

PICK UP THAT PHONE,
CALL MY COUSIN TODD,

AND TELL HIM LIL DEE
IS AT THE GATE.

WAIT. HOLD UP.
DID YOU SAY LIL DEE?

YES, I DID.

DO YOU KNOW
MARQUIS FONTAINEAU?

LIGHT SKIN
WITH THE GOOD HAIR?

YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

YOU KNOW MY DADDY?

AW, HELL, NO!

LET'S ROLL.

MARQUIS, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW LIL DEE.

I MET HER. I SEEN HER.
I SEEN YOUR DAMN BABY.

I COULD BE WRONG,
BUT I THINK YOU'RE

GETTING A LITTLE HEAVY
UP ON THE FAMILY.

I MEAN,
A FEW ADDS CHARM,

BUT THIS IS
STARTING TO LOOK

LIKE A RERUN
OF GOOD TIMES.

MAMA COULDN'T MAKE IT.

YOU KNOW,
HER RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

STARTED FLARING UP
IN THAT LEFT ELBOW.

SO I HAD TO GIVE HER
AN ICY-HOT PATCH.

SHE SAID SHE'D
SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

Todd: I TOLD YOU
TO RESCHEDULE IT, MAN.

JUST GO HANDLE MS. PETERS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

Boy: DADDY! DADDY!
DADDY! DADDY!

UM, TODD, DO YOU
WANT TO DO SOMETHING

ABOUT THESE
LITTLE KIDS HERE?

I'M NOT
YOUR DADDY. NO.

Lil Dee: COME HERE!

NOBODY KNOWS WHO
YOUR DADDIES ARE.

NOW, WHAT DO YOU
CALL THESE AGAIN?

CHITTERLINGS.
AND A COOKOUT

AIN'T A COOKOUT
WITHOUT THEM.

I HATE TO ASK,

BUT WHAT EXACTLY
IS A COOKOUT?

WELL, IT'S WHEN
THE FAMILY GETS TOGETHER.

YOU SEE THEM OUT THERE?

WE GET TOGETHER.
WE DANCE.

WE GRILL MEAT.
WE SHARE GOSSIP.

WE SING. WE CAN PLAY
DOMINOES, CARDS.

WE HAVE A GOOD TIME.

THE THREE F's--

FUN...

FOOD...

FAMILY.

HMM...

OOH!

[MEN LAUGHING]

THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

LEROY, USE
A COASTER, MAN.

YOU'RE MESSING UP
MY TABLE.

YOU LEFT IT OUT HERE
FOR PUBLIC USE.

THE LAW SAYS THAT'S
AN ASSUMED RISK.

YOU NEED TO STOP FRONTING
LIKE YOU'RE A REAL LAWYER

AND PASS THE BAR.
DO THAT.

A REAL LAWYER.

HEY, I KNOW MORE
THAN ANY REAL LAWYER.

I TOOK THE BAR 15 TIMES.
THEY ONLY TOOK IT ONCE.

DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LEARN ABOUT THE LAW

WHEN YOU TAKE IT OVER
AND OVER AND OVER?

HUH? JOJO, WHEN IS
THAT FOOD GONNA BE READY?

I'M STARVING.

WHOO!

AW, MAN, NICE PLACE
TODD GOT HERE.

SURE IS.
MM-HMM.

I MEAN, LOOK
AT THE TREES.

YOU KNOW, I PLANTED
A TREE ONCE.

NEVER COULD
GET IT TO GROW.

HEY...GRASS.

I COULD NEVER GET
MY LAWN THIS NICE.

THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE BLACK.

WHAT?
I GOT RACIST GRASS?

NO. THE WATER
COMPANY--

THEY PUMP
LOW-GRADE WATER

INTO THE BLACK
NEIGHBORHOODS.

THAT'S WHY YOU
NEVER SEE NICE LAWNS

IN BLACK
COMMUNITIES.

WHAT THE HELL
IS LOW-GRADE WATER?

IS IT POSSIBLE, LEROY,

THAT PEOPLE IN THE HOOD,
THEY CAN'T AFFORD LANDSCAPERS,

AND THEY SAVE MONEY
ON THE WATER,

SO THEY DON'T WATER
THEIR LAWN AS MUCH?

THAT'S WHAT THE MAN
WANTS YOU TO THINK.


Bling: HOW FAR AWAY
ARE WE?

YOU GO SOUTH
BY MY THUMB,

AND YOU MAKE A RIGHT
AT MY PINKIE,

AND YOU GO 2 INCHES.

OH, WAIT. OH, WAIT.
I GOT IT UPSIDE-DOWN.

THIS JUST DON'T
MAKE NO SENSE.

GIVE ME
THE DAMN MAP.

LET ME SEE.
I GOT IT, BLING.

[TIRES SCREECHING]

WHEEZE! WHEEZE!

I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

LET GO!
WHAT YOU DOING, MAN?

WATCH OUT FOR THE CAT.

[TIRES SCREECH]

SO SHE GOT MAD AT ME,

AND SHE'S GONNA...

SHUT THE HELL UP.

DAMN.

LOOK WHAT YOU MADE
ME DO TO MY CAR!

SORRY.

IF MY ARM WASN'T
NUMB RIGHT NOW,

I'D KNOCK
YOUR HEAD OFF.

YOU'RE CONFUSING
ME HERE.

WHICH WAY IS SOUTH?

HEY.

LOOK AT THE KITTY.

THAT'S A RARE SPECIES.

HEY, KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

HEY, KITTY, KITTY,
KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

HEY, KITTY, KITTY--


WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?


WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

WHAT HAPPENED?

I THINK HE JUST
FARTED ON ME.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING--

FOOL! GET
THEM SNEAKERS, MAN!

WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF TIME OVER HERE.

MY BABY.

HURRY UP, MAN.

YOU SMELL THAT?

WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SMELL?

IT'S PROBABLY THESE
STINKY-ASS SNEAKERS

YOU GOT ME
LUGGING AROUND.

MAN, THEM SNEAKERS
ARE GONNA GET US PAID.

MAN, WALK OVER THERE, MAN.
THEM SNEAKERS STINK.

[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]

SHH...

LOOK. RIGHT.

WELL, GIVE ME A LEG UP.

OK.

HERE.

READY?

DO YOU SEE
ANYTHING?

THEY'RE TURNING
OUR COMMUNITY

INTO A TRAILER PARK
IN THE PROJECTS.

HEY! Y'ALL
THE NEIGHBORS?

WELL, COME ON OVER
TO THE COOKOUT.

NO.
MMM-MM.

NO, COME ON!
COME ON!

WHOO!

EILEEN...

I'M COMING FOR YOU.

[DOG BARKING]

WAIT! GUINEVERE!

GOOD AFTERNOON,
SIR.

HOW MAY
I HELP YOU?

THAT'S MY WIFE.

Emma: JEEVES,
LET HIM IN.

YOU MUST BE HOLSTEAD.

COME ON IN AND JOIN US.

I'M LADY EM.
YOU CAN CALL ME EMMA.

AND THIS IS LIL DEE.

HEY.

AND THESE ARE
HER CHILDREN.

THIS IS SONNY RAY,
LITTLE RAY, D.J.,

SONNY D., D.Q.R.S.,
WHATEVER.

SO MANY OF YOU.

WHOO.

IT'S SO HOT
IN HERE.

HERE'S YOUR HAM, WITH ALL
THE SALT AND THE FAT

AND THE ARTERY-CLOGGING
GOODNESS THAT YOU LOVE.

AND NOW MY DRESS
SMELLS LIKE HAM.

SO EXCUSE ME.

OH, HONEY.

THIS IS
A BONELESS HAM.

YES. YES. THAT IS
A BONELESS HAM.

OH, HONEY,
IT'S THE BONE

THAT GIVES THE HAM
THE FLAVOR.

THIS WILL NEVER DO.

YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.
NOW LISTEN.

YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TODD TO LOSE THIS DEAL

BECAUSE OF THE WRONG HAM
NOW, WOULD YOU? HA HA.

NO, I WOULDN'T.

NO, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

NOW LISTEN, SWEETIE.

ABOUT 25 MILES
DOWN THE ROAD THERE,

THERE'S A GOOD BUTCHER.

GET YOU A GOOD HAM,
ALL RIGHT?

MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT?

NOW, I'M
NOT QUITE SURE

I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

OK, LADY, LET ME
BREAK IT DOWN

FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

IF A BLACK CAT
CROSSES YOUR PATH,

THAT MEANS WHAT?

7 YEARS BAD LUCK,
RIGHT? ALL RIGHT.

NOW, WHAT'S SLANG
FOR A DUDE? A CAT.

SO ERGO, I.E.,
I AM A BLACK CAT.

SO IF I CROSS
YOUR PATH,

YOU SUBLIMINALLY
THINK

THAT YOU'RE GONNA
GET BAD LUCK.

THAT IS WHY
MY WIFE LEFT ME,

BECAUSE I'M BLACK.

IS HE SERIOUS?

OH, YEAH. SEE,
AT EVERY FAMILY COOKOUT,

WE GET CAUGHT UP
ON EACH OTHER'S LIVES,

NO MATTER
HOW SAD THEY ARE.

SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES--
THEY'RE ALL AROUND US.

YOU KNOW,
LIKE IN SPORTS.

LIKE HOCKEY.
WHY IS THERE

A BUNCH OF WHITE GUYS

SMACKING A BLACK PUCK
AROUND THE ICE?

WHY CAN'T THE PUCK
BE WHITE?

WELL, BEING IN
SPORTS MANAGEMENT,

I'D VENTURE TO SAY
THAT ON ICE,

A WHITE PUCK MIGHT
BE DIFFICULT TO SEE.

I'D EXPECT YOU TO SAY THAT.

WAIT A MINUTE, LEROY.
WHAT ABOUT GOLF?

I MEAN, THE BALL
IS WHITE.

YEAH. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

AND I THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

IN GOLF, YOU
GOT TO DO WHAT?

GET THAT WHITE BALL
IN THE HOLE.

WHERE'S THE HOLE?
ON THE GREEN.

GREEN. "FERTILITY."

YOU SEE WHAT I'M
GETTING AT HERE?

WHERE'S THAT HOLE?
IN THE EARTH.

MOTHER EARTH.
"HI, MOMMY." YEAH.

WHITE GUYS
TRYING TO GET

THEIR WHITE BALLS
IN MOTHER EARTH,

SYMBOLIZING HOW THEY
WANT TO RAPE THE PLANET.

I SHOULD WRITE
A BOOK, MAN.

"THAT HAM HAS
TOO MUCH SALT IN IT.

"NO, THAT HAM
HAS TOO MUCH BONE IN IT.

NO, THAT HAM HAS
TOO MUCH PORK IN IT."

KEEP IT TOGETHER.


NOW, WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO IS,

YOU'RE GONNA GO GET
THE DAMN HAM FOR HER,

AND ONCE ALL THESE GHETTO
HOOD RATS ARE OUT OF MY HOUSE,

WE'RE GONNA GET IT
FUMIGATED.

THEN I WILL HAVE TODD
ALL TO MYSELF.

WHAT'S UP,
GOLD DIGGER?

EXCUSE ME...

BUT I AM NOT
IN THE MOOD.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN MAD.

GAME RECOGNIZE
GAME, HONEY.

GAME RECOGNIZES
GAME?

LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

YOUR GAME IS NOT

UP TO PAR
WITH MY GAME.

WHAT IS IT,
LIKE, 5 OR 6

LIL DEE-DEES I SEE
RUNNING AROUND HERE?

AND THAT OLD-ASS
SCOOBY DOO VAN

THAT YOU'VE BEEN
DRIVING AROUND.

YEAH. I SEEN IT.

NOW, I DRIVE

A BRAND-NEW
MERCEDES BENZ.

AND THIS
IS MY MANSION.

THAT'S ALL
FINE AND DANDY,

BUT I CATCH YOUR
LITTLE TRIFLING TAIL

TRYING TO PLAY
MY COUSIN,

AND I'LL CUT
YOUR ASS.

OH, AND BY THE WAY,

THAT TIRED LITTLE DRESS
YOU'RE TRYING TO ROCK,

WE ALL KNOW
THAT AIN'T REAL.

POCAHONTAS JUST
TRYING TO FRONT,

ACTING LIKE SHE GOT
INDIAN IN HER FAMILY.

LITTLE BIT CHEROKEE.

CHEROKEE?

LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

YOU NEED NOT WORRY
ABOUT YOUR COUSIN,

BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN
IS MY PROBLEM.

I'M GONNA TAKE REAL
GOOD CARE OF HIM.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS STOP LOOKING FOR

YOUR BABIES' DADDIES

DOWN AT
THE PAROLE OFFICE.

AND YOU, LITTLE
GHETTO BIRD,

NEED TO INVEST
IN A DIAPHRAGM.

[HORN HONKS]

LOOKIE HERE, BLING.

LOOK WHAT
WE HAVE HERE.

Man: YOU FELLAS
NEED A LIFT?

HELL, YEAH. COME ON, WHEEZE.
LET'S GET IN.

YOU KNOW, I DON'T MIND
PICKING YOU BOYS UP,

BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW IT CAN BE.

RIGHT ON.

I'M IN THE HORSE MANURE
CONSIGNMENT BUSINESS,

A MANURE BROKER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

BASICALLY, I GO AROUND
TO ALL THE RANCHES,

I SCOOP UP
THE HORSE...

AND I SELL IT

TO ALL THE FARMERS
AND THE LANDSCAPERS.

THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE.

AND IF MY TRUCK
BREAKS DOWN,

LET ME TELL
YOU, GOD,

NOBODY'S GONNA
PICK UP THIS GUY.

YOU WANT SOME?

NO.

GOOD. YOU OK?

NOW, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

THERE'S A DEMAND

FOR GOOD-QUALITY...

I TELL THE FARMERS,

MAKE SURE
YOU FEED YOUR HORSES

A WELL-BALANCED
DIET.

ANY DOCTOR
WILL TELL YOU,

IF YOU PUT
GOOD STUFF IN,

GOOD STUFF IS DEFINITELY
GONNA COME OUT.

THAT'S IT! STOP THE CAR!

STOP THE CAR!

AND DON'T SAY...
ELSE ABOUT...

COME ON, WHEEZE!
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

HEY.

Todd: DEE, YOU NEED
TO CHECK YOUR KIDS.

THEY'RE SCRATCHING UP MY STAIRS.
LOOK AT THIS.

Boy: OH, MAN, WE CAN'T
DO NOTHING OVER HERE.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE
NEVER CAME HERE.

I SHOULD HAVE WENT
TO LEBRON JAMES' HOUSE.

I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

DISRESPECTFUL.

BOY, YOU WORRY
TOO DAMN MUCH.

ALL THIS RUNNING-AROUND
THEY DOING,

THEY'RE GONNA START DROPPING
LIKE FLIES IN A MINUTE.

JUST CHILL.

I TRIED
TELLING HER, TODD,

BUT YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST UNCIVILIZED.

LEROY, LEROY, LOOK WHAT THEY DID
TO MY DAMN BAT.

I'M COMING TO GET YOU!

GRANDPA!

AUNT NETTIE, COULD YOU PLEASE
KEEP THESE KIDS OUT OF HERE?

MY AGENT AND I ARE TRYING
TO DO SOME BUSINESS.

OK.

PLEASE. JUST...

CALM DOWN, HONEY.

AGENT.

CHECK.

GOOD JOB.

Nettie: JAMAL!
JAMAL! JAMAL!

TODD'S AGENT IS HERE,
AND BABY, IF HE SEES YOU PLAY,

I KNOW WE CAN GET
A CONTRACT,

MAYBE EVEN BIGGER
THAN TODD'S.

MOM, LOOK. I GOT
CHECKMATE IN ONE MOVE.

AND HOW MANY TIMES
I GOT TO TELL YOU?

I'M NOT TRYING
TO PLAY PRO BALL.

WELL, YOU JUST
CHECK THAT, BABY.

NOW, I WANT YOU
TO GET DRESSED NOW!

NO EXCUSES!

NETTIE, NOW JAMAL HAS
A LIFE OF HIS OWN

THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
PRO BASKETBALL.

WE DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR A TRYOUT.

WE CAME HERE
FOR A COOKOUT.

WHEN'S THAT FOOD
GONNA BE READY?

QUIET, FRANK!

IF YOU'D
SPENT MORE TIME

TEACHING YOUR SON
HOW TO PLAY

INSTEAD OF FEEDING
YOUR FACE,

I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO BE DOING THIS!

MAMA'S GONNA GET
HER BABY A CONTRACT

WHETHER HE
WANTS ONE OR NOT!

YOU, GO GET
YOUR SWEATS ON!

NOW!

THE BOY AIN'T EVEN
GOT A HOOP.

NICE AND QUIET.

AWAY FROM ALL THE INSANITY.
HAVE A SEAT.

WE ARE SO SORRY ABOUT
ALL THE DISTRACTIONS.

I ASSURE YOU,
THIS FAMILY GATHERING

WAS A COMPLETE
SCHEDULING MISHAP.

IT'S OK.

I'M RATHER
ENJOYING MYSELF.

ARE YOU? IT'S FUN, RIGHT?
COOKOUTS ARE FUN.

ANYWAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE NEW PRODUCT LAUNCH, OK?

WE KNOW THAT THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR COMPANY,

AND WE THINK
THAT TODD WOULD BE

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
PICTURE IT--

YOUNG ROOKIE,
OUT ON THE ROAD,

MISSING HIS FAMILY,

NEEDING YOUR SERVICE
TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM.

[GLASS SHATTERS]

GOD!

Man: STOP SWINGING THAT BAT!
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET HURT!

EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE,
MS. PETERS.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

YEAH, YEAH.

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

FOUL! FOUL!
Y'ALL SAW IT!

IT'S MY BAT!
MY BAT!

GRANDPA, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, NOT IN THE HOUSE.

PLEASE, NOT IN THE HOUSE.

RULES!
RULES! RULES!

EVERYBODY ALWAYS
TELLING KIDS

AND OLD FOLKS
WHAT TO DO.

COME ON, KIDS.
LET'S GO.

WE'LL SHOW THEM.
COME ON.

WE'RE GOING
OUTSIDE

AND POO-POO
ON OURSELVES.

OH, GOD.

EW...GOD.

OH...

I LOVE YOU,
UNCLE TODD.

I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAN. OH...

WHAT'S UP?

DO YOU SEE
THAT POODLE?

WHOSE DOG IS THAT?

YO, I'M GONNA GIVE
IT SOME COOKIES.

COME HERE, GIRL.

GIVE ME ONE, MAN.
LET ME TRY. GIVE ME ONE.

HERE, MAN.

I AIN'T GIVING MY COOKIE
TO NO DOG, MAN.

YOU MUST BE CRAZY.

OK, THIS IS IT, BABY.
TAKE IT TO THE HOOP.

TAKE IT TO THE HOOP.
THIS IS IT.

MA, YOU CANNOT
BE SERIOUS.

WHERE AM I
GONNA PLAY BALL?

THERE'S NO BASKET
IN HERE.

YOU WANT A BASKET?

THERE'S YOUR BASKET.

"D" UP, LEROY.
NO EASY BUCKETS.

WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT,

BECAUSE I'M ALREADY...
I'M UP IN HERE.

UP IN HERE, BABY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

COME ON, BOY.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

COME ON.

COME ON.
YOU READY FOR ME?

DON'T TRY TO GO LEFT.
DON'T GO LEFT.

I'M TELLING YOU--

YES!

THAT'S MY BOY!
THAT'S MY BOY!

DID YOU SEE HOW HE
HANDLED THAT BALL?

YOU CANNOT TELL ME

THAT MY BABY
DON'T HAVE GAME.

SO, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

I THINK...WOW.
OH, MY GOD. I GOT A CALL.

YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING.

MY JAMAL, HE SHOULD BE
PLAYING IN THE PROS!

[MUSIC PLAYING]

OH, YEAH.

THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

YOU THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THIS IN THERE?

DAMN! WHAT
DO YOU WANT NOW?

DID YOU READ THE RULES
AND REGULATIONS?

BECAUSE I CAN SEE ABOUT
10 VIOLATIONS IN HERE,

AND I AIN'T EVEN
UP IN HERE GOOD.

YOU ARE WAY OVER THE ALLOWED
AMOUNT OF VISITORS.

YOU'RE TOO LOUD.

AND DO I SMELL A GRILL?

OH, NO. YOU NEED A PERMIT
TO COOK OUTDOORS.

IT'S JUST A COOKOUT.

WE AIN'T
BOTHERING NOBODY!

LOOK, YOUNGBLOOD,
BACK THE HELL UP.

NOW, LOOK,
MR. ANDERSEN,

YOU BETTER GET
YOUR FAMILY TOGETHER,

OR YOUR TIME AT GARDEN RIDGE
WILL BE OVER REAL SOON.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

EVERYBODY GET OUT!
AFTER THIS FOOD IS DONE,

GET A DOGGY BAG
AND GET OUT!

HEY, MAN, WHY DON'T
YOU CALM DOWN, MAN?

YOU TRIPPIN'.

WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU? YOU--

HEY, YOU HEAR ME
TALKING?

DON'T TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME.

JOJO.

YEAH. IT'S
ALL RIGHT, BABY.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

IT'S ALL RIGHT,
BABY.

IT'S OK.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

HE'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIM?

[CLEARS THROAT]

I HATE TO INTERRUPT,

BUT HAVE EITHER OF YOU
SEEN MY DOG? GUINEVERE.

GUINEVERE.

I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

IN THE HOUSE, GUINEVERE.


OH, NO.

IS THAT
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

YEAH.

I'M SHOCKED
AT YOU TWO YOUNG MEN.

SO AM I.

WE'RE SORRY.

I WEEP
FOR YOUR GENERATION.

IN MY DAY...

NO ONE WOULD CONSIDER BAKING
WITH INFERIOR INGREDIENTS.

TAKE THE HIGH ROAD,
MY SONS.

THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS AN...EASY BAKE.

HA HA HA. YEAH.

LIGHT 'EM UP.
LIGHT 'EM UP.


I CAN'T FEEL
MY FACE, MAN.

AH, WHO WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT

THAT A STRAIGHT-LACED
DUDE LIKE YOU

WOULD ENJOY
GETTING A LIFT? MAN.

I USED TO LIKE TO DO
A LOT OF THINGS

BEFORE I MARRIED
MRS. CROWLEY--

DRINK MALT LIQUOR,

LISTEN TO RAP MUSIC...

EAT OREO COOKIES.

OH, I KNOW
THAT ONE.


IF SHE'S SUCH
A BUZZ-KILL THEN,

MAN, WHY DID YOU
MARRY HER?

IT WAS A GOOD
BUSINESS DECISION.

SEE, SHE COMES
FROM MONEY,

AND WHERE I WAS RAISED,
MONEY MARRIES MONEY.

YEAH,
BUT THEM TITS

IS NICE, TOO,
THOUGH, HUH?

WHAT ABOUT THEM NIPPLES?
SHE GOT SOME LITTLE RAISINS

OR SOME NICE
BIG GUMDROPS?

THAT'S MY WIFE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

OH, MY BAD, MAN.

SORRY.

OK.

GUMDROPS.

I KNEW IT! I SEEN THEM
IN HER SHIRT!

YOU MIND IF I HELP?

KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

OH! SWEET JESUS!

HEY, HEY, HEY.
COME ON.

LET ME HELP.
LET ME HELP.

YOU'LL TEAR
THE THING UP.

IS IT COMING OUT?

YOU CAN PUT A FLOWER
OR SOMETHING OVER IT.

A FLOWER, EM?
LOOK AT THIS.

I GOT TO TAKE THIS
BACK TOMORROW.

$1,200?

WHY'D YOU SPEND
$1,200 ON A DRESS?

I WANTED TO BE MORE
FABULOUS THAN YOU, OK?

NETTIE, COME ON.
COME HERE.

COME ON. SIT DOWN.

GOD, NETTIE,
COME ON NOW.

WHEN YOU AND ME,
WE WERE COMING UP,

WE WERE TIGHT,
WE WERE CLOSE.

THEN EVERYTHING
CHANGED. EVERYTHING.

WHY?

ALL THE WHILE
WE WERE GROWING UP,

ALL I EVER HEARD

WAS HOW BEAUTIFUL
EMMA WAS

AND HOW SMART EMMA WAS.

EVEN NOW, IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE THE BETTER PARENT.

TODD IS HOSTING
A COOKOUT IN THIS CASTLE,

AND JAMAL CAN'T EVEN GET
A PRO BASKETBALL TRYOUT.

YOU'RE ACTING LIKE

THIS IS SOME KIND
OF COMPETITION.

JAMAL IS TOP HONORS
IN HIS CLASS, NETTIE.

HE'S DAMN NEAR
A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT, OK?

HE COULD BE A DOCTOR
OR A LAWYER.

YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT THAT?

HE COULD CHANGE
THE WORLD.

WOW. CHANGE
THE WORLD.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

LAWYERS AND DOCTORS
MAKE GOOD MONEY.

HELLO.

THIS AIN'T NO
COMPETITION, BUT...

THEY MAKE GOODMONEY.

Jeeves:
MISS BECKY CRUZ.

HEY.

HEY, LADY EM.
THANKS FOR INVITING ME.

HI, BABY.

YOUR MOTHER
TOLD ME

I'D FIND YOU
BACK HERE.

COOKOUT'S AROUND THE BACK.

JUST FOLLOW THE CIGARETTE BURNS
AND THE DOO-DOO DIAPERS.

YOU DON'T
RECOGNIZE ME,

DO YOU...
DOO-DOO HEAD?

DOO-DOO HEAD?

BUCK TEETH, BRACES,
GLASSES SO THICK

I COULD SEE
INTO THE FUTURE.

BECKY?

MM-HMM.

YO. GIRL.

HEY.

SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

OH, MAN.

DAMN, GIRL!

YOU LOOK...
WHAT HAPPENED?

YOU...YOU DID
YOUR THING.

WHAT CAN I SAY?

AFTER 10 YEARS
IN BRACES,

I GUESS MY TEETH FINALLY
DECIDED TO COOPERATE.

THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU WAS...

THE COOKOUT
THAT MY MOMS THREW

FOR ME AND JAMAL

BEFORE I WENT
TO RUTGERS.

YEAH. I JUST GRADUATED
FROM SPELLMAN.

CONGRATULATIONS.

THANKS. I JUST
MOVED BACK HOME.

I START AT DENTAL
SCHOOL IN THE FALL.

BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

LOOK AT YOU.

YOU'VE COME REALLY FAR,
DOO-DOO HEAD.

NOT FAR ENOUGH.

WHEN MOMS GAVE WORD
ABOUT THIS COOKOUT,

MY FAMILY
STARTED SHOWING UP

FASTER THAN ROACHES
AT A GARBAGE STRIKE.


YO, HURRY UP.
WHAT'S TAKING YOU SO LONG?

YO, WHEEZE, HURRY UP
SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

I ALMOST GOT IT.

[ENGINE TURNING OVER]

EXCUSE ME. WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

COME HERE AND SHUT UP.

Brittany: AAH!
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

Bling: JUST DRIVE THE CAR,
AND NOBODY WILL GET HURT.

OK, I WILL,

BUT MY BOYFRIEND'S
REALLY RICH.

HE'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

YOU JUST GET US
TO GARDEN RIDGE.

WE'LL WORRY ABOUT
YOUR BOYFRIEND LATER.

REMEMBER ABOUT...
2 YEARS AGO,

WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING
AGAINST INDIANA STATE?

YOU WERE STRUGGLING
THE WHOLE GAME.

THAT WAS THE WORST
GAME I EVER HAD.

YEAH, I THINK
I WAS, LIKE,

2 FOR 8 FROM
THE FREE-THROW LINE.

YOUR FAMILY HAD
THESE BIG SIGNS UP

WITH YOUR NAME
ON THEM...

AND THEY STAYED UP
THE ENTIRE GAME,

EVEN WHEN YOU
WERE ON THE BENCH.

THEY BROUGHT THOSE
SIGNS TO EVERY GAME.

THEY'VE ALWAYS
HAD YOUR BACK.

WAIT A MINUTE.

WAIT A MINUTE.

SO YOU USED TO
WATCH ME PLAY?

DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

HA HA HA.

BUT...YES.

JUST BECAUSE
WE LOST TOUCH

DOESN'T MEAN I DIDN'T
CHECK UP ON YOU.

I GUESS I GOT SOME
APOLOGIZING TO DO.

YEP.

YOU KNOW, BECKY...

I ALWAYS, ALWAYS
THOUGHT YOU WERE

REALLY SPECIAL
TO ME, AND, UM...

IT WAS SOMETHING
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO,

BUT I NEVER
GOT A CHANCE TO--

I WANTED TO
DO THAT EARLIER.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

WHOO! YES.

COME ON.

SUMMER.
IT'S REALLY SUMMER.

YEAH.
THANK YOU, MAN.

MA, THOSE POTATOES
YOU MADE EARLIER WAS BANGING.

LOOK, MA, THE STUFF
I SAID EARLIER--

I LOVE YOU,
TOO, TODD.

COME HERE.

I'M SORRY, MOM.
I'M SORRY.

MMM...

JEEVES, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

WELL, I'M GIVING
TO-GO CONTAINERS

TO YOUR GUESTS, SIR.

MAN, PUT THOSE AWAY.

PEOPLE ONLY USE THOSE
TO BRING FOOD HOME

AFTERA COOKOUT.

OH. VERY GOOD, SIR.

LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

I PUT HIS ASS IN CHECK
RIGHT QUICK,

JUST LIKE I DONE YOU.

PLUS THAT STUPID GATE ARM
WON'T OPEN.

OH!

REMEMBER, I ALWAYS
LOVED YOU, BABY.


TIME TO BREAK THE GLASS.

YOU KNOW, I'M...
I'M TRYING TO FIND

MY HUSBAND HOLSTEAD.

HAVE YOU SEEN
MY HUSBAND HOLSTEAD?

MY HUSBAND HOLSTEAD?
EXCUSE ME!

[CONVERSATION STOPS]

HAS ANYBODY SEEN HOLSTEAD?

MY HUSBAND.

[DOOR OPENS]

HOLSTEAD!

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

WHAT IT LOOK LIKE?

I GAVE ME
AND THAT BITCH

SOME FLAVOR.

WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
USING THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE

IN FRONT OF--AAH!
LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF HER?

HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
HOW SENSITIVE SHE IS?

LOOK HERE, WOMAN.

THINGS ARE GONNA
CHANGE AROUND HERE.

I'M TIRED OF YOU
PUTTING YOUR FOOT

ON THE BACK

OF A BROTHER'S NECK
ALL THE TIME.

THERE IT IS.

AMEN, BROTHER.

DON'T LET HER PUT WHITE BALLS
IN MOTHER EARTH.

DAMN STRAIGHT.

I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

I MEAN, YOU'RE SO PROUD
AND...SEXY.

LET'S...GO HOME. NOW.

WOMAN, WHAT DID I
JUST TELL YOU?

WE GO HOME
WHEN I SAY SO.


ALL RIGHT.

COME ON.
LET'S GO.

I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT,
MRS. CROWLEY.

YOU BETTER GET THAT.

OK, EVERYBODY,
LET'S SAY GRACE.

TODD, YOU'RE OUR HOST.
LEAD US IN PRAYER.

DEAR LORD, THANK YOU
FOR THIS GATHERING--

SIR!

A MR. BIG PIMPING
BLING-BLING

AND MR. O.G.
BIG WHEEZER.

WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

IT'S THE SNEAKERS,

THE FUNKY-ASS SNEAKERS
OVER THERE.

THAT DON'T SMELL
LIKE FEET.

IT SMELLS LIKE ASS.

YEAH.

Y'ALL ARE DOING
THE DAMN THING IN HERE, HUH?

CORN...

HAM...

SOME CHICKEN...

MAC AND CHEESE.

LOOKS LIKE Y'ALL DON'T NEED
NO MORE OF THAT.

BRITTANY,
WHAT'S THIS TRASH

YOU DONE BROUGHT UP
IN THIS HOUSE?

I'M SORRY.
HE HAS A GUN.

BUT, LADY EM,
HERE'S THE HAM.

IT HAS BONE IN IT
AND EVERYTHING.

WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME

BLACK FOLKS GET TOGETHER
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME,

JOKERS LIKE YOU ALWAYS SEEM
TO MESS IT UP?

YOUR KIND
IS THE REASON

GOOD FOLK LIKE TODD
LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

YOUNG MAN,
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.

Bling: SHUT
THE HELL UP, LADY.

TAKE CARE OF THEM
KIDS BACK THERE.

THAT'S WHAT YOU
NEED TO BE DOING.

LOOK, MAN, WHO ARE YOU?

AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE, MAN?

DON'T ACT LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

I TAUGHT YOU
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

NOW GET YOUR ASS
UP AGAINST THE WALL

AND SIGN
THEM SNEAKERS.

HEY, MAN.

WHAT?

LOOK OVER THERE.

WHAT'S SHE TRYING...
WHAT'S SHE SAYING?

ALL RIGHT, LUSCIOUS.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

TODD, ARE YOU IN
SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?

POP, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THESE DUDES ARE.

DOES THIS SORT OF THING
OCCUR FREQUENTLY?

OH, YEAH. I'VE BEEN
TO MANY COOKOUTS,

AND LET ME TELL YOU,

THIS KIND OF THING
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

IT'S ALL PART
OF THE FESTIVITIES.

YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HIDE THE PEARLS.

I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT TODD AND HIS FAMILY

ARE ALL LAW-ABIDING
CITIZENS,

AND I HOPE THIS DOESN'T
AFFECT YOUR DECISION

ON GIVING TODD
THE CAMPAIGN.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT
YOUR HANDS BACK.

HEY, GIVE ME
THE BAT, OLD MAN.

ACT SCARED.
IT'S KIND OF FUN.

Grandpa: GET YOUR HANDS
OFF MY WOOD!

THIS GUY, HE SORT OF
REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE.

IN FACT,
REMEMBER THAT GUY

WE USED TO GO
TO SCHOOL WITH,

THE ONE
THEY USED TO BUG?

PERCIVAL ASS...
SOMETHING.

GET YOUR HANDS
OFF MY WOOD, SUCKER!

YEAH.

PERCIVAL?

PERCIVAL ASSMACKEY?

All together:
PERCIVAL ASSMACKEY?


SHUT UP!

STOP LAUGHING AT ME!

SHUT THE HELL UP!
STOP LAUGHING AT ME!

YOU TWO, STOP LAUGHING!

STOP LAUGHING AT ME!

ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

[LAUGHTER FADES]

SHUT UP!
AND IT'S PRONOUNCED...

"ASSMOKEE."

IT'S WEST AFRICAN!


Y'ALL THINK
THIS IS REAL FUNNY.

WHY ARE WE WASTING
TIME WITH THEM?

I SAY WE THROW
THESE BUMS OUT,

AND LET'S GET
TO EATING.

COME ON!

SIT YOUR ASSES DOWN!

UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO BLOW A HOLE

IN THIS $30 MILLION
KNEE OF YOURS.

NO!

NO!

UH!

BRITTANY.

WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

Jamal: YOU'RE OK.
JAMAL IS HERE.

Jeeves: HERE
YOU ARE, SIR.

THANK YOU.

Nettie:
BE CAREFUL, JAMAL.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, SWEETIE.

MA, YES, I DO. I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

LOOK, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU, I'M PRE-MED.

I'M GOING TO MEDICAL
SCHOOL NEXT YEAR.

OOH, A DOCTOR.

DID SOMEBODY
SAY "DOCTOR"?

MAN, ENOUGH OF THIS!
I'M SICK OF Y'ALL!

SHUT THE HELL UP!

WHEEZE, GET ON DOWN HERE.

GET ALL THE CASH
AND THE JEWELRY.

GET THESE SNEAKERS SIGNED.
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.


AH! FREEZE!

YOU DON'T WANT
NONE OF THIS, BOY.



THAT WAS SOME
GREAT POLICE WORK,

APPREHENDING
THESE TWO.

THANK YOU, OFFICER.
GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE.

YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

I LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE.

YOU SEEM WAY
TOO QUALIFIED

TO BE A SECURITY
GUARD.

HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED

A CAREER IN
LAW ENFORCEMENT?

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY!

DEEJAY ENUFF!
HEAVY HITTERS!

WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE IT
