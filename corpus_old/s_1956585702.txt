My love.

<i>Cara mia.</i>

Oh, no! No, no, no!

Oh, Thing!
Best hand always has the ring!

PRIEST: Dearly be-loathed,

it is indeed a rare privilege
to see our family

gathered together
for this Addams tradition.

To commence this ceremony

and deliver these two

into the yawning void
of matrimony,

we put the lime in the coconut
and drink them both up.


(GUESTS GULPING)



I now pronounce you...

VILLAGER 1: Monsters!
VILLAGER 2: Freaks!

VILLAGER 3: Get out, Addams!

VILLAGER 4: You've been here
long enough!

VILLAGER 5: We've had
enough of your kind!

Addams aren't wanted here!

VILLAGER 6: Leave already!

husband and wife.

Quick, put the lime
in the coconut

and drink 'em both up!

(VILLAGERS CLAMORING)

Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

VILLAGER 7: This is our home!

(GRANDMA ULULATING)

Grab onto my hairy hump!

(FESTER GRUNTING)

I think I can see
my house from here. (ECHOING)

Oh, no.
That's a women's prison.

Oh, Gomez, why do hordes
of angry villagers

follow us everywhere we go?

We are safe, my love,
that is all that matters.

I want to find a new home

that is shrouded
from the world.

Someplace that is truly us.

Yes! Somewhere horrible!
Somewhere corrupt!

Somewhere that no one
in their right mind

would be caught dead in!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

GOMEZ: Unhappy, darling?

MORTICIA: Yes, completely.

Oh, Gomez,
you have torn down my walls

and stabbed your name
onto my heart.

(GOMEZ KISSING AND MOANING)

GOMEZ: My wan temptress,

your hand is as cold
as a dead fish.

My love, that is a dead fish.

Mmm, mmm...

So it is.

(GOMEZ CONTINUES KISSING)

Darling,

is that a wrinkle
I see on your pallid brow?

What's wrong?

We can't run forever, my love.

I want a home again.

I want our children
to grow up in peace.

I want to pick out
cemetery plots.

Morticia, I swear on my life
I will find us a new home.

And your every wish
shall be granted.

No, he seems

"State Hospital for

Gomez.

GOMEZ: That must be
the asylum.

MORTICIA: Oh, thank goodness.

A decent place
to sleep for the night.

(MOANING AND ROARING)

Hmm?

Thank you, old boy.
Lead the way.


GOMEZ: It's quiet. Too quiet.

MORTICIA:
Must be the off-season.

(DOOR CREAKS, SLAMS)

GOMEZ: Hello?

(RATS SQUEAKING)

There's no one here.

Could it be abandoned?

All right, Ichabod. I'm awake.

Not for long. (GRUNTS)

Real mature, Pugsley.

Oh, please.

You never threw an axe
when you were my age?

Of course I did.
I never missed.

How I wish something
would liven up

this already tedious day.



Thanks for trying, Ichabod.

(CHUCKLES WICKEDLY)




Here's Pugsley!

(DETONATOR BEEPS)




GOMEZ: All right, son.
That's enough.

so fast these days.

(WIND WHISTLING)

(RAPID BEEPING)

Don't make me come up there!

(RAPID BEEPING)

This is your last warning!

(PARACHUTE TEARS)



My head. Ow, ow, ow.

Pugsley, we're supposed to be
working on your swordplay.

Your Sabre Mazurka
is two weeks away,

and you've barely
practiced at all.

So I missed one practice.
What's the big deal?

The big deal?

The Sabre Mazurka
is the most important day

in a young man's life.

It's what makes you an Addams.

It's the day your entire
family gathers around you

and passes judgment on
your worth as a human being.

I hear it's like Thanksgiving.

But swords
are so old-fashioned.

I'm more of a demolitions man.

Explosives have no place
in a Mazurka. Hand them over.

All of them.
(METAL CLATTERING)

And the TNT.

And the M-80s.
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)

Roman candles. Bang snaps.
Holy Hand Grenades.

(SQUEAKING)
(ROOSTER CROWS)

Son, our family hasn't been
all together in 13 years.

They are coming
from all over the world

to see you
on your special day.

I just want it
to go perfectly.

All right, Pop.
I'll practice.

That's my boy.

(METAL CLATTERS, BEEPING)

(RAPID BEEPING)

MORTICIA: (SNIFFS) Putrid.

Mmm. Horrifying.

I call spleen.

Mmm...

Ah, ow...
MORTICIA: Wednesday.

Please, no ink stains
on the table.

Yes, Mother.
(PUGSLEY MUMBLES)


Gomez, everyone we've invited

to the Mazurka
has threatened to come.

I know. Isn't it wonderful?


All Addamses
under one roof again.

Yes, but where will
everyone sleep?

We'll have Lurch fix up
the mausoleum.

It'll be like
sleepaway camp.

(EXPLOSIVE BEEPING)

Very well, darling.
(RAPID BEEPING)

(EXPLOSION)
(FESTER SCREAMING)


BOTH: Uncle Fester!

Brother!


Don't worry, I'm okay.

The plate glass window
broke my fall.

Ha! Ha!

BOTH: (SINGING) <i>Rick'em,</i>
<i>rack'em, roar'em, buzz</i>

<i>Addams is as Addams does</i>

(BOTH EXCLAIM)

I am thrilled you're here!
(GRUNTS)

(FESTER CHUCKLES)

I'm not late, am I?

Actually, we weren't expecting
you for another two weeks.

Huh. So, not late.

I apologize, darling.

You see,
I asked Fester to come early

to help Pugsley
with his Mazurka practice.

Hey! (GRUNTING)

No! No!

That's a bad Kitty!

If I'd known you were coming,

I would have prepared
the dungeon.

Please, don't worry.
I'll sleep in the attic.

You won't even know I'm here.

I've practiced that move
in a lot of people's homes.

(CHUCKLES EXCITEDLY)
WEDNESDAY: Uncle,

can you tell us
what's beyond the gate?

(TRAY CLATTERS)
(LURCH GROANS)

Why ever would you
ask that, dear?

I heard a strange noise
in the fog earlier,

and I should like
to investigate.

There's nothing out there
but boring marshland.

There must be something.
We never go anywhere.

Who knows the untold horrors
we're missing out on.

MORTICIA: Darling,
we have all the horror

we need, right here.

Uncle Fester can go
wherever he likes.

Now, now,
there are some restrictions.

You know,
I can't go to the mall,

or a zoo, or a building...

When you're older,

you can travel
to your heart's content.

But for now,
it's safer for you here.


Socrates, come.

FESTER: ...South America,
Europe, China,

Asia, most parts of Africa.

I'm allowed in Antarctica!

ANNOUNCER: <i>You're watching</i>

Well, I'm here to help.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>I take your

<i>and turn it into the perfect

No matter how outdated your

<i>My only flaw?</i>

<i>Sometimes I care too much.</i>


I'm Margaux Needler,

and I'm about to stage
a <i>Design Intervention!</i>

You're welcome in advance.

Today, we're putting
the finishing touches

on our biggest project yet.

Assimilation.

We didn't just
make over a house.

We made over a whole town!

And in just two weeks,
on our live season finale,

you will be able to buy

your very own
piece of Assimilation.

That's right!

In a <i>Design Intervention</i>
first,

we are putting a whole
neighborhood up for sale.

This will be
your chance to purchase

the house of your dreams

in the town of your dreams!

Sounds good?
I thought so.

Welcome to Assimilation,
neighbor.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

ANNOUNCER: <i>This program
brought to you</i>

<i>by Neighborhood Peeps.</i>

<i>Your neighbors are watching!</i>

GLENN: And, we're out!

Love it. Perfect.

Let's set up
for the walk-through.

Margaux,
did that feel good to you?

No, Glenn.

We need more balloons,
more confetti.

Roger that.
What are we selling here?

Big dreams. You know
how you get big dreams?

Uh...
With big ratings.

Got it.
Double the balloons.

And I want
a blizzard of confetti.

I want so much confetti
that we need

snow patrols
to find lost children.

I bet my home improvement
empire on this town.

Every house must sell

or we're out of business!

It's got to be perfect!
PARKER: Mom!

You're never
gonna believe this.

What is it, Parker?

I found a creepy mansion
up on the hill!

I'm so glad you're exploring,
Parker,

but I don't have time
to talk right now, sweetheart.

Mama needs to help people.

I need help.
Aren't I people?

MARGAUX: (CHUCKLES)
Oh, you're cute.

Don't you have Chipper 'N'
Cheer practice this afternoon?

Run along, honey.

Now, Glenn, what are
the numbers we're expecting?

Well, if you look here...
Mom!

(GLENN CONTINUES
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

Ugh!

(KIDS CHATTERING AND LAUGHING)

(PUGSLEY STRAINING)
(WOOD CREAKING)

PUGSLEY: Left a bit. Up a bit.

Now, down a bit.

(SNICKERS) Perfect.
(LURCH GROANS)

And three, two, one...

(AIR HORN BLARING)
(GASPS)


You made me miss!

Do you know how long
it took for me to set this up?

Look, Pugsley...

Your Mazurka's coming up,
and, well, you're not ready.

Even if I am the only one
who sees it.

So, pay attention,

and you might actually
get through this.

PUGSLEY: Wait.

You're going to help me?

Why?

Because you are my brother.

And... (ECHOES) I love you.

(FOREBODING MUSIC BUILDS UP)

All right.
How are you gonna help me?

You see that hole over there?

Go stand beside it.

Uh... That hole?

That hole.

PUGSLEY: Mmm...
I don't get it.

(WIND BLOWING)

PUGSLEY: Whoa.

(SHOVEL CLANGS)
(BODY THUDS)

Darling, not to criticize,

but is that really
as tight as you can make it?


I'm just a bit preoccupied
with the Mazurka preparations.

Oh, I am as well! (EXCLAIMS)
(CLAMP CREAKING)

I fear Pugsley
is overconfident

and doesn't truly understand

the importance
of this tradition.

Good news, everybody.
Pugsley's gone.

MORTICIA: Wednesday,
I know that tone of voice.

Dig up your brother. At once.

the gene pool.

MORTICIA: Hold on.

What do you have there?

I'm not sure.
I like it.

It's so... What's the word?
The opposite of sad?

Darling, bring that to me.

Strange, there's usually
a murderous clown

attached to the other
end of these.


What, in the name of
all that is unholy, is that?

(SMACKS LIPS)
It tastes like cotton candy.

How do you know
what cotton candy tastes like?

Tish, it was my youth.
I made mistakes.

Wednesday, wherever did
this pink thing come from?

WEDNESDAY: Outside.

They're everywhere.

(DOOR OPENS)

FESTER: Strangest weather
system I've ever seen.

(PUGSLEY SNARLING)

What is that?
Where's it coming from?

GOMEZ: Wait, wait, wait.

The fog, it's lifting.

Well, that would
only happen if...

Someone drained the marsh.
But who?

MORTICIA: A town.
This is not good.

We must go down there

and introduce ourselves
at once.

This day is becoming
most wonderfully disruptive.

(PLAYING LIVELY TUNE)

GLENN: Let's keep going
with the run-through, okay?

MARGAUX: Welcome back.

I'm so delighted
to show you my house.

You can own one just like it,
just less large.

Blah, blah, blah.
Sconces, crown molding.

Which leads us to what I call
the Salon de GrandÃ©.

Cross here, turn,
and then say something like,

"Now, before I show you
this view,

"go to an antique store,

"buy a chair,
and reupholster it.

"'Cause you're gonna
wanna sit down for this."

What? What's the matter?

For heaven's sake,
what's going on?

Do I have something
in my teeth? What is it?

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)


(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(CAR HORN HONKS)

MORTICIA:
Not a single gargoyle.

GOMEZ: Maybe this isn't
such a bad thing.

We have been
isolated here for a while.

FESTER: I could really
see myself dying here.

Play nice, Kitty.

(KITTY ROARS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

Well, no one is running at us

with torches and pitchforks,
so that's a plus.

You know, darling,
I don't think we'll need

to put the family
in the mausoleum.

They can stay here!

The family
would never be comfortable.

It will be years

before rust and decay set in.
(WOMAN GASPS)

How you doing?

It's all so... different.

Pugsley, don't drink it all.

This gentleman
wants some, too.

(WHIMPERS SOFTLY)
GOMEZ: Sir, it's all right.

He's had all his shots!
(MAN YELPS)

What a nervous man.

Come on, Tish, let's
explore the neighborhood.

I'm gonna pop in here
for two minutes

and I'll meet you in
the town square. Agreed?

Very well, darling.

(DOOR BELL JINGLES)
Good day, all.

(PEOPLE GASPING)

Don't let me interrupt
your cup of joe

or whoever you have in there.

So, what's dark and bitter
here other than yours truly?

Madagascar Emerald Peaberry,

in a summer patchouli roast.

It has notes of oak,
cherry, and yoga.

Hmm. You know, I'm looking
for something a bit stronger.

Ah! Let me try that.


Mmm! Morticia, you have
to try these coffee grounds.

They have a wonderful grit!

Just a moment,
what am I hearing?

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>we all belong, yeah</i>

<i>Everybody come together</i>

<i>Sing our song, sing our song</i>

<i>Life is really perfect
We are one big family, yeah</i>

<i>Everything is so much better</i>

<i>When I'm like you
and you're like me</i>

<i>What's so great
about being yourself</i>

<i>When you can be
like everyone else?</i>

Wow, that is
absolutely horrible!

<i>It's easy to be happy
when you have no choice</i>

<i>Yes, it's easy to be happy
when you have no choice</i>

Hold on,
unless I miss my guess here,

I believe that is
supposed to be music.

They're greeting us with

one of their
traditional songs.

Well, then,
we ought to do the same.

Wonderful idea, Fester.

<i>Isn't it great
when we are all together?</i>

<i>Say it again
until you believe it</i>

<i>I believe it</i>
(ALL GRUNTING)

<i>We believe it</i>

(BLOWS PIPE)

(MUSIC STOPS)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIM)

<i>I'd tip my hat to you</i>

<i>I'd do just that</i>

<i>Take it right off for you,

But I haven't got a hat</i>

(SCATTING)
(BATS SCREECHING)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

What? What'd I do?

How rude.

Gomez, we should return home.

Morticia,
this is not the old country.

True, these people
are a little different.

But deep down,
we're all the same.

(MAN SCREAMING)
(KITTY ROARS)

We have to give them a chance.
Get to know them.

We have to win them over.

"Win them over"?
(BRAKES SQUEAL)

Well, good morning, neighbor!

Margaux Needler.

Gomez Addams.
At your service.

My wife, Morticia.

Charmed.

GOMEZ: Our children,
Wednesday, Pugsley.

And my brother, Fester.

Hey, neighbor!
(MARGAUX GASPS)

You know, we can see
right into your windows?

Nice to, uh, meet you.

As your neighbor,
I'd like to offer you

the opportunity of a lifetime.

How'd you like
a free home makeover

from a world-renowned
interior designer?

It will be a challenge,

but I can beautify that
old house of yours so fast,

it'll make your head spin.

I don't wanna brag,

but mine already does that.
Look.

(NECK CRACKING)
(CHUCKLES)

I should like to see what this
plastic woman has to offer.

Yes, well... When is
a good time to stop by?

Actually, Ms. Needler...
(CLEARS THROAT)

Darling...

Stop by anytime you'd like.

Oh, wonderful!
Then it's settled.

I'll see you at your house,
first thing tomorrow.

You're welcome in advance! Ta!

(TIRES SCREECH)
(GLENN GASPS)

That woman seems deranged.

Her face reminds me
of a death mask.

"Deranged"? "Death mask"?

You tell me
she's got halitosis,

and I'm hearing wedding bells!

(RAVEN CROWING)

(PLAYS CEREMONIAL MUSIC)

GOMEZ: Pugsley, this is
the Addams family saber.

300 years of Addams

have danced the Mazurka
with this blade.

Uh-uh.

Only when
you've shown me you're ready.

Your father was the greatest
swordsman in Addams history.

His Mazurka
was the stuff of legends.

So no pressure!

It's all right here,
in the Mazurka handbook.

Every Addams performs
this rite of passage

to show that you're prepared
to defend your family.

It sounds easy,
but believe me, it's insane!

Fester, hand him

the goo-goo-ga-ga
baby training sword.

(SWORD SQUEAKS)
Pop?

Has anyone
ever failed the Mazurka?

Once.
Your third cousin, Xander.

Never heard of him.

Exactly.

Music!

(GONG CRASHES)

There's someone at the door.

Hi, guys. I'm going up
to this creepy mansion.

If you don't hear from me
in 30 minutes, send backup.

(DOOR CREAKS)


Yeah, no.

Life's too short. See ya!

(GROWLING SOFTLY)

MARGAUX: Oh!

GOMEZ: (CHUCKLES)
Good morning, Kitty.

Greetings, Ms. Needler.

(DOOR SLAMS)

Wow. (CLEARS THROAT)

Good morning!
I hope this isn't a bad time.

The worst. Do come in.

Glenn?

(ROARS)
(GLENN SHRIEKS)

(PANTING)
(MARGAUX CLEARS THROAT)

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Thank you.

Oh, my! Hmm.

Are you ready
for your Margaux makeover?

Quite.

Pugsley's been climbing
the walls in anticipation.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

MARGAUX: Well, well, well!

Let's take a look around,
shall we?

And before you say anything,
you're welcome.

Now, if we're trying for
a more contemporary look,

well, these sconces
have to go.

(MITCH YELPS)

The sconces were a gift
from dead relatives.

If we get rid of them,

they'll be terribly hurt
the next time they visit.

And this is our whine cellar.

We have a lovely
collection of whines.

WHINER 1: <i>Are we there yet?</i>
WHINER 2: <i>I want ice cream!</i>

WHINER 3: <i>What do you mean
you're out of avocado toast?</i>

WHINER 4: <i>This barrel
makes me look fat.</i>

And here's our bottomless pit.

(HOLLOW RUMBLING)

DENISE: Uh...
How do we get across?

One moment.


We call this surfing the web.

(DENISE GULPS)

MARGAUX: Well!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

DENISE: I'm scared.

I'm so scared.
(GLENN WHIMPERING)

Oh, my gosh.
(DENISE PRAYING IN SPANISH)

DENISE: I'm scared

I'm scared to open them.


(WHIMPERING)

(ROPE CREAKING)



How do all those people fit
in that little contraption?

(PARKER YELPS)

My vanity mirror only
imprisons 14 souls at a time.

(PARKER WHIMPERS)

Uh, you don't
have a cell phone?

That's weird.

I may not have a cell phone...

Well, you don't
have a crossbow,

and I thought
everybody had one of those.

Mmm.

My name is Wednesday.

Okay.

Uh, I'm Parker.
How long have you lived here?

My whole life.
Which seems endless.

PARKER: I've never
seen you at school.

I'm cage-schooled.

Excuse me?
It's terribly dull,

but my mother insists.

(SKIN SQUEAKS)

I'm actually
cutting cage right now.

(PUGSLEY SNARLING)

Uh, okay.

So, what happens
at your school?

Uh, not much, just friends
turning on each other.

Girls making other girls
feel bad about themselves.

Typical junior high stuff.

WEDNESDAY: Intriguing.

Can anyone go to your school?

I guess so. But who'd want to?

FESTER: Wednesday!

Great shot!

(CAMERA CLICKS)

(GIBBERISH CHANTING)

(MARGAUX SCREAMS)


(MARGAUX PANTING)

Mr. and Mrs. Addams,
there's really not much to do

to make this place perfect.

All we have to do
is pull down the side walls,

and then also break down
the other two walls.


Open up the ceiling
by breaking it irreversibly.

Just get this nasty little
floor out of the way,

and there you go. With just
those little touches...

Stop! Right there!

Don't touch another thing!

It's perfect.
Ms. Needler, you have a gift.

The good news is I can have
a makeover crew up here

and swinging hammers
first thing in the morning.

What do you say?

We thought you were finished.

Our whole family
is coming in two weeks.

(HIGH-PITCHED) Our finale!

(NORMAL TONE)
Our finale is in two weeks.

Thank you, Glenn.

It's a gracious offer,
Ms. Needler,

but you really
have done enough.

It's our son's Mazurka.
You understand.

Thank you.

Uh, we're missing Mitch.

Where's Mitch?

SPIRIT OF THE HOUSE: <i>Get out!</i>

Mitch who?
(BOTH SCREAMING)

(GLENN WAILING)

Gomez, I'll be blunt.

I have 50 houses
to sell down there,

and their view of your
property is, well, off-brand.

Fifty houses?
Yes.

You know,
ever since my family

was chased out
from the old country,

my one dream has been

to find a place
we could call home.

Once they see Assimilation,

want to stay for good.

(MARGAUX EXCLAIMS)

Thank you so much
for coming by, Membrane.

It's Margaux!

Well then, run, Margaux!

(GATE CREAKS)
Run, run, run!

(GATE BELCHES)

That Wednesday girl
is a freak.

We're about to be invaded
by a whole army of freaks.

It's tragic when people
can't accept

the help they so badly need.

And when that happens,

well, another kind of
intervention is called for.

MORTICIA: I agree, Gomez.

The whole family moving here
would be a dream come true.

But I don't trust
that Margaux woman.

She's an eccentric, darling,
give her a chance.

"Rasp-berry preserves."


Must be some kind
of scented embalming fluid.


Wednesday,
practice your lurking

on someone
other than your father.

He's too easy.

Much better.

Mother, Father,
I'd like to speak with you.

What's on your mind,
my little nightcrawler?

I spoke with Parker
this afternoon.

She's the daughter
of that talking mannequin

who came by.

She told me about
a communal school

all the neighborhood children
attend.

It's called "junior high."

"Junior high"...

Yes, yes,
I have read about those

in my abnormal
psychology journals.

Anyone of age can enroll.

I think it would be
good for me.

Well, I think
it's a capital idea.

What of your studies here?

Your taxidermy
is coming along so well.

Mother,
would you really deprive me

of the opportunity to torment
children my own age?

Ah, she makes a point.

What's more,
with Wednesday in school,

we'd get to know
the people here even better.

Well, Mother?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(KIDS EXCLAIMING)

Have a good day
at school, dear.

Do your worst!

(STUDENTS CHATTERING)

Ah. Now I understand.
This is a children's prison.

PARKER: Great.

This is Wednesday.

Hello.

(TWINS GASP)
BETHANY: Hey, Parker.

(PARKER GASPS)

I got something for ya.


A moldy sandwich?

You're slipping, Bethany.

You know what?
You're right.

(BOY GRUNTING)
Let's kick it up a notch.

(GIRLS GASP, GIGGLE)

(BETHANY LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

You have no sense of humor!

(GIRLS GIGGLE)

GIRL: Did you see her face?
BETHANY: I know.

Bethany, is it?

Don't cut your eyes on my crew
unless you're ready to dance.

What did you say,
little ghoul?

I don't think you understand.

I'm not locked up in here
with you, Bethany.

You're locked up in here
with me.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)


Whatever.

LAYLA: What did you do?

You shouldn't have said that.

There's nothing you can do.
Bethany's way too popular.

Popularity is fleeting.

I prefer to set my sights

on something
a little more challenging.

ALL: Like what?

The establishment.
(GIRLS GASP)

(MARGAUX SCATTING)

Let's see.
Who shall I be today?

How about...

Ah, Shelly Longbottom,

From Shelly Longbottom

"Did you hear

"about those Addams people?"

"Someone told me
they're wanted in 30 states."

(CELL PHONES CHIMING)

You know they're raising
a garden of man-eating plants?

And feeding them our pets!

Has anyone seen
my Shih Tzu Fee-fee?

They're gonna turn us
all into zombies.

Where are they from anyways?

It doesn't matter!

It's obvious
they don't belong here.

Honey! Oh, those awful people
up on the hill.

They're not even
on Neighborhood Peeps!

Well, that's suspicious.

Why not? I haven't seen

GOMEZ: Darling,
Wednesday will be fine.

She can take care of herself.

It's not Wednesday
I'm worried about.

It's the rest of them. We may
need to provide an alibi.

My love, it's game night.

Wednesday will be home soon,

so why don't you
come and join us?

Oh, very well. F-6.

Pugsley,
you heard your mother.

Blow F-6!

(ROOF CRUMBLING)

(PANTS EXCITEDLY) Yes!

You sunk my battleship.

Ha-ha! Well done, Pugsley!


Hello, my uglies!

Mother! I thought
I felt my skin crawling!

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Grandma, what a surprise.

I thought you were in Prague.

I was!

They caught me smuggling
crocodiles out of the zoo.

But I escaped
and talked my way

onto a Somali pirate ship.

We got into
a heated poker game

and I cleaned them out.

Cheating or robbery?
GRANDMA: Both!

Always remember, Pugsley,

it ain't cheating
if no one catches you.

in two weeks. Ugh.

Or is it months?

Ha! That reminds me.

Guess what I've got, Pugsley?

Candy!
Oh, yes!

MORTICIA: But the Mazurka
isn't for a week.

Why are you here so early?

Gomez said you needed
a little help with the party.

And I said, I got my son ready
for his Mazurka,

so of course, I'm going to do
the same for my grandson.

I love him!

It's true! I sent for her!

I can't believe you bothered

your mother with that,
darling.

Neither can I?

He said you were
in over your head.

Thank you, Mother!

Said you were more tense
than he's ever seen you.

I didn't say that exactly.
GRANDMA: Yes, you did.

You said that exactly.

Said he was worried

you'd have a massive facial
expression and... (GROANS)

You know, I'm starving!
Let's eat!

Not until Wednesday gets home.

Where is that
granddaughter of mine?

I got something for her!

(LOUD CLANG)

Ah, there's my
little storm cloud!

Wednesday,
where have you been?

WEDNESDAY: Elsewhere.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(MORTICIA GASPS)

(BAT SQUEAKING, SLURPING)

What are you wearing?

Parker calls it
a pop of color.

While I certainly
appreciate a horse

with a spear
through its head,

the color is...

She claims
it brings out my smile.

Wednesday,
you don't have a smile.

Turns out
I have a lot of things

you don't know about.

(LURCH MOANS)

GRANDMA: (GASPS)
I see I got here just in time.

You were right to call, Gomez.

I'll talk to her.
Hand me that bear trap.

Thank you, Grandma.
But I will handle this.

Ah, suit yourself.

When you're done with Fabio,
send him up to my room.

Ooh-hoo-hoo.
LURCH: Oh, boy!

MORTICIA: Wednesday.

How would you like
to join me tomorrow

after the school for tea
and sÃ©ance in the cemetery?

Is attendance mandatory?

Come now, my little raven.

You did so love it
when you were younger.

If you like, Mother.

Sleep well, dear.

Don't forget to kick
your father good night.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
(SIZZLES)

PARKER: What's your
favorite filter?

I don't know. I look black
and white in all of them.

PARKER: You know,
when I met you,

I thought you were
super weird.

But now,
I think you're really cool.

I concur.

You're not completely devoid
of merit yourself.

I wanna say "thank you"...


Oh, how'd that barrette

you bought yesterday
go over at home?

Actually, my mother's reaction
was, well, unexpected.

She was accepting.
It depressed me.

One never wants to see
one's mother that way.

But I must admit,

walking around in something
so garish, so grotesque...

I was shocked
how thrilling it felt.

I could do that.

But my mom makes me
wear this stuff,

and it's just so...

I believe the word you're
looking for is "unfortunate."

Ugh. I'd love to
just go crazy

and wear something
that would shock her.

Well, Parker,

you're in luck.

You happen to be talking
to the queen of shock.

(HAUNTING ARIA PLAYING)


(CRYSTAL BALL RINGING)

Hello, Mother.

GRANDMA FRUMP:
<i>Where's my little wraith?</i>

still hasn't arrived.

We agreed to come up here
for tea and sÃ©ance,

and now it seems
she stood me up.

GRANDMA FRUMP: <i>Morticia!
Can you hear me?</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP:
<i>You're not doing it right.</i>

<i>Press that button there.</i>
GRANDMA FRUMP: <i>I did! I did!</i>

<i>Wait, I see something.</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>You did it!</i>
GRANDMA FRUMP: <i>Hello, darling!</i>

<i>Now, where's my granddaughter?</i>

Just what I said.

I think she's distancing
herself from me.

GRANDMA FRUMP: <i>Oh,
she's wrapped in a black hole</i>

<i>of emptiness and longing,</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>Wednesday?
It's not Wednesday!</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>Who's this?</i>
It's me, Father.

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>Morticia?</i>

<i>What's wrong with you now?</i>

The world can be so cruel.

And all she wants to do
is run toward it.

GRANDMA FRUMP:
<i>She's a lot like you that way.</i>

<i>You wanted to see the world.</i>

<i>Find yourself.
Serve time!</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>Listen,
Morticia, remember the time</i>

<i>you ran away
and joined the Girl Scouts?</i>

<i>We were so worried
you were on a bad path.</i>

<i>But when you found out
that campfires</i>

<i>were for roasting marshmallows
and not other Girl Scouts,</i>

<i>well, you got bored
and you came home.</i>

GRANDMA FRUMP:
<i>We were so relieved.</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP:
<i>Trust Wednesday.</i>

<i>Like you,
she'll do the right thing.</i>

Thank you, Father.
That's most comforting.

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>Good.
Wait a second.</i>

<i>When did I die?</i>

GRANDMA FRUMP: <i>20 years ago.</i>

GRANDPA FRUMP: <i>Oh, right.
Happy anniversary, darling.</i>

All right, Pugsley, let's,
uh, go through it again.

You got this, Pugsley.
This Mazurka's nothing.

(SLURPS)
(LIQUID SLOSHES)

You eat swords for breakfast.
(BELCHES)

You just got a case
of pre-ball jitters.

It's way more common
than you think.

If a Mazurka lasts
for more than four hours,

contact your doctor.

From the top.
Music!

(PLAYS UPBEAT TUNE)



(HIGH-PITCHED MOAN)

Pugsley,

I can honestly say

that was most definitely
a thing you did.

what in heaven's name was it?

The Sabre Mazurka.


You know what?
You've been practicing hard.

Why don't we
call it a day? Hmm?

Hit the showers, kid.
(SLAPS)

So, we're finished?

Ah, yes.

Yes, son. We are
most certainly finished.

Mmm. Okay. Thanks, Pop.

Thanks, Uncle Fester.


This is a complete disaster!
How did this happen?

And he's going
to make a fool of himself

in front of everyone!

Gomez, you gotta calm down!

There's still a day
to get him ready!

Fester, a year wouldn't be
enough to get him ready.

I've failed him, Fester.

I tried to raise him to be
an Addams, but I failed.

They're going
to eat him alive.

<i>Ooh, baby</i>

<i>I said I like it like that</i>

<i>Ooh, baby,
I like it like that</i>

All right. Thank you.

Grandma,
we already have a band.

They came highly recommended
from the mortuary.

Oh.

they're good.

My sister Sloom is
going to be judging Pugsley.

And if things aren't done
the traditional way,

she won't be happy,

and the Mazurka
could be a disaster!

But what do I know?

Fine.

SHRUNKEN HEAD 1:
Yay, we got the gig!

SHRUNKEN HEAD 2: We got it!

Ah, one more thing...

enter this house like that.

Wait, where are your tattoos?

Oh, thank the stars!

Where were you?
Hanging out with Parker.

Is this why you skipped
tea and sÃ©ance?

Your grandparents
were trying to contact you.

Holy Hades!

Whoever did that to you,
Wednesday,

I hope the other guy
looks worse.

Nobody did this to me.
This is my new look.

Do you like it?

I do not like it.

Everyone knows pink
is a gateway color.

I warned you about sending her
to public school.

Don't worry.

Wednesday is never
going to that school again.

What?
MORTICIA: In fact,

she's never leaving
this house again.

Wow, that's some evil eye
she's got there.

No, that dead-eye stare
is new.

And I think I know
where she got it.

Hey, guys, this is me now.

If you like it, hit "like,"
but who cares if you like it.

I'm living my truth.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)


Who did this to you?
I did.

This is my new look, Mother.

I decided that from now on,
I choose my clothes, not you.

Argh! This is that little
creep Wednesday Addams' work!

She's not a creep.
She's just not like you.

Why can't you ever let
people be different?

Because it's my calling
to make everyone the same.

It burns! (GROANING)

Good! Maybe it'll burn away
the weird!

I hate it here!

Everything's boring
and fake and bright,

like plastic flowers!

Like you!

Parker!
Plastic flowers live forever.

Now, you go think
about that in your room.

With no social media.

No! Please, no.
Anything but that!

Now go wipe that depressing
goop off your face.


Oh! Those Addamses
have gone too far this time.

I think they're going to need
a little more help.

Hey!

Where are you going?

A friend's.

I hold people prisoner,
not the other way around.

Good luck with your Mazurka.

Wait, you're leaving?

Who's gonna torment me
every day?

Living under this roof is
all the torment you'll need.

Besides, our parents
have made it clear

that the only way
to be accepted in this family

is to be exactly like them.

I can't play
by those rules anymore.

Farewell, brother Pugsley.

Tomorrow, you become a man.

And I become a fugitive.

Always kinda knew
it'd end up like this.

Just didn't think
it'd be so soon.

WEDNESDAY: I'll never
forget you, Pugsley!

But I'll try.

Pugsley, have you seen
your sister?

She's not in her room.

PUGSLEY: Mmm...

Pugsley. Where's Wednesday?

Um... Tsk.

Tick, tock,
tick, tock, Mother.

You're getting very sleepy.

Pugsley...

She did not go
to her friend's house.

She went to
her friend's house?

I repeat, she did not
go to her friend's...

Fire!

(ALL WHIMPERING)

SPIRIT OF THE HOUSE: <i>Get out!</i>

(PANICKED SCREAMING)

Pugsley!

What is the true meaning
of the Mazurka?

It's about protecting
our family

from those who would
do us harm!

Go ahead.
Show 'em what you're good at.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>All we have to do
is pull down the side walls!</i>

ROCK MAFIA: (SINGING)
<i>You shouldn't mess with me</i>

<i>You don't wanna mess with me</i>

<i>'Cause if you mess with me
You're messing with my family</i>

(GUESTS SCREAMING)

Everyone, follow my boy!

(PUGSLEY CHUCKLING)

Hey, guys!


(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

ROCK MAFIA: <i>You might think
that we are all loco</i>

<i>But this family
is about to go global</i>

MARGAUX: <i>Fire!</i>

(ALL WHIMPER)

Shakalaka bang, baby!

Quick! Out this way!

(ALL MURMURING)

(ALL GASPING)

Pop, I'm out of ammo!

We're trapped!


(ALL WHIMPERING)

(ALL YELP)

Hope I'm not crashing
the party.

PUGSLEY: Wednesday!

Yeah!
(ALL SIGH)

Ichabod, quick,
lower your branches!

Everyone, grab on!

(PEOPLE EXCLAIMS AND MURMUR)

Margaux Needler never stops
until the project is complete.

(MARGAUX LAUGHING)

PUGSLEY: Fire in the hole!

(MARGAUX GASPS)

Mazurka!

(GUESTS CHEERING)

MORTICIA:
Is everyone all right?

No limbs missing that weren't
missing before you arrived?

(ALL SIGH IN RELIEF)

My little raven,
I'm so happy you returned.

Of course I came back.

I knew there was no way

you were going
to save yourselves.

You are like
weak baby squirrels.

(GUESTS GROANING)

(RELIEVED CHATTER)

WEDNESDAY: Socrates.

Eight legs, nine lives.

GOMEZ: You were right,
<i>cara mia.</i>

People can be cruel.

What have we done?

They're just a family.

MARGAUX: A family?

Oh, please!
They're a bunch of monsters!

Don't go soft on me, people.

I will relish hounding you

until that nuclear waste dump
of a house is gone

and your mutant family
along with it! Ah!

Be careful what you wish for,
Ms. Needler.

My family and I will never run
from the likes of you again.

(GASPS, STAMMERS)

Deep breath, Margaux.

Okay, I have a finale
to shoot.

Parker, let's go.

PARKER: I'm not going
anywhere with you.

I'm staying with my friend.

MARGAUX: Your friend?

Parker, these people
are freaks.

If they're freaks,
then I'm a freak.

And so are all of you.

Exhibit A.

Ms. Gravely, you put
your underwear in the freezer.

Hey, it's refreshing, okay?

Exhibit B.
Trudy Pickering.

You sit on
the toilet backwards.

Well, where else am I supposed
to put my arms?

Wait, how did you know that?

Because your houses have been
infested with Needler-Vision.

She has hidden cameras
everywhere.

What?
(ALL GASP)

WEDNESDAY: And watches you
all of the time.

In my private time?

MAN: That is creepy, actually.

What else has she seen?
That is over the line!

MARGAUX: Shut up!
(ALL GASP)

Listen, you lemmings!
This is my town.

You are nothing
but a bunch of extras.

We are going to march down
that hill and do a live show.

I expect you to convince

those brainless peons
out there in the audience

that this is the perfect place
to buy a house,

or none of you will be living
here much longer.

Do you hear me?
Actually, Mom,

everyone can hear you.

You've been live
this whole time.

Three million people
are watching you right now.

The real you, for a change.

Please, what do I care what
a bunch of bloggers think?

GLENN: Margaux?


It's the network.

They're taking your show
off the air.

What?

No. I'll be...
I'll be bankrupt.

Who will buy all these houses?

Okay, watch this.
Now's my chance.

Excuse me, (CLEARS THROAT)
I just tooted.

Furthermore,
I think I can help you

get rid of those houses.

What are you talking about?
Well, my dear,

you've got a bunch of houses
you need to get rid of,

and I've got a bunch of family
I need to get rid of.

WOMAN: Hello?

Excuse me. I'm Trudy.

Trudy Pickering. We...
We never officially met...

Ah, yes. The toilet woman.

Right.

Listen, uh, please, give us
a chance to make it right.

Let us have
our own design intervention.

WEDNESDAY: Mother,

I spent time
with these people,

and it is true, they are odd.

But we shouldn't judge them

just because
they're different.

(SOFT MURMURING)


(INDISTINCT CHATTER)


(BOTH EXCLAIM)

(WOMAN EXCLAIMS)

Have a wonderful day!
ONION: Whoo-hoo.

MALE ADDAMS:
And there you are.

Bye-bye.
WOMAN: Thanks! Bye!

Well, hello there!

Howdy, neighbor.
How's the new house?

Oh, I love it. I hope
you brought your umbrellas.

Oh, you put in a typhoon.
What a great idea.

Don't forget
the gift basket, silly.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

We got scented
embalming fluid,

toes, teeth, a fruitcake,

rat bait,
got some dried apricots...


He's like training a puppy,
adorable but tiresome.

She's the woman of my dreams!

Her breath is like
a baby's diaper.


Who would have thought
a guy like me, a total zero,

would have ended up with you,
an also zero?

Well, do come in!

SLOOM: Now, with
the house rebuilt, Pugsley,

we can throw you
the celebration you deserve!

You are Addams
through and through.

(ALL APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

SPIRIT OF THE HOUSE: <i>Get out!</i>

Oh, how lovely.
The spirit's home.

Finally, back to normal.

(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

We did good.

I won't tell anyone
if you don't.
