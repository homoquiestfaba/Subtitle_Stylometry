NadÃ¨ge done ruined half my shit.

I could use some new stuff.

Yeah, you should do it.

I don't have no money to go out.

Think it's cute ringing
everybody's bells this late?

Yes, she's sorry.

Fuck that bitch.

I'd use the belt on
that one, Lucila.

You gotta teach these kids

Omari.

You're like a little girl.
Hold up.

Of the average Joe's â™ª

What's up?
NadÃ¨ge kicked me out.

better to do?

I'll be done at five.

Gotta go now.
Hey.

Please.

All you ever

Shit's mad predictable.

Your coach is wack, yo. Your
problem ain't even in the lift.

You're not getting your shoulder in
close enough. You gotta go deep.

Tell me how he rock that much
bling and not be locked up.

What'd NadÃ¨ge throw you out for?
She a crazy bitch.

She's jealous 'cause
Hassan paid for my nails.

Ain't my fault she ain't
learned how to please her man.

You got a new foster family yet?
Whatever.

Soon as my dad get out,
I'll stay with him.

Wait, give me that.

What are you doing?

Who that?
Omari.

Get out of here. Mo don't
live here no more.

I left my math book in her room.
Is she with you?

Oh, you fucking bitch!
Your punk ass through!

Okay, Mo.

You wanna play?
Mo, hurry up.

Why you wanna do that?

This slut done broke
in my house, Hassan.

Hang up that phone
before I smack you.

â™ª She used to hit
me with a strap â™ª

â™ª When I was bad â™ª

Yo.

Mad people be trying
for the Powerball.

Don't they know black people
don't never win real money?

Shit, if I won...

I'd buy me one of them big-ass TVs.
Surround sound and all that shit.

Imagine Halo on that.

A TV?
Yeah.

I get that much money, I'm getting
a house and getting the fuck out.

Where you gonna go?
Everyone you know is here.

That much money, you can get a house,
move to Miami and be on the beach.

Eating oranges all day and shit.
Oh, yeah, oranges.

You'll be a millionaire and
you gonna be peeling oranges.

Please, you gonna be peeling for me.
Yeah, all right.

Yo.

I don't know. Can I?

How about you give

1800-fine-ass-ho. What's up?

Yo, Omari, where you going?

Don't make me go back to
that Spanish lady house.

Chill with me. Omari!

Gotta be up early for a run.
You said we chilling at your place.

It's better that way.

I'm gonna go. I got
practice in the morning.

Yeah? What for?

Wrestling, actually.

No shit. What you weigh, 130?
Yeah.

But I'ma drop to 120.
I'ma dominate at 120.

Best correct your footwork.
Whatever.

How you gonna say whatever when
you be tripping on your feet?

Think 'cause your mom buy you new
sneakers, you gonna make varsity?

Take out all of the glass?

Yeah.
Good.

You no want if we get fined.

You got a job? You work here?

Better get your asses home. Ya'll
looking for trouble out this late.

Let me get your number.
Ain't got one yet.

Let me give you mine.

All right, I'll see you.

When he get out?

Mind your damn business.

What'd I say?
"I'm gonna dominate at 120."

You wouldn't even be on a
team if it wasn't for me.

Why you mad for?

You supposed to be happy
your pops is out.

Mo?

You don't see me working?

Why didn't you come find me?
I been busy.

Can I come live with you?

You lost your mind?

I can get a job.

No.
I can help pay for the rent.

No. I said no!

Shit.

What you need me for anyway?

Look at you. You a
grown woman now.

You do your thing, I'll do mine.
We see each other round the way.

I talked to him.
He got a job now.

Like, a real job.
Have a seat.

You can find out where
he live, right?

First we need to discuss
what happened at NadÃ¨ge's.

I had to get the rest of my shit.
We had an agreement, Mo.

You'd let me know if anything was
missing, and I'd send someone.

I don't trust that bitch.

And as your social worker, if I
can't trust you, I can't help you.

Not gonna need your help
when I move in with my dad.

We talked about this, Mo.

He's not your legal
guardian anymore.

Well...

he said he wanted
to adopt me, so...

I know the last few homes
have been difficult.

But I do think Lucila...

could be a really good family...

No, she's not my fucking family!

You lucky you skipped algebra.

Ms. Nestor gave us a quiz, and I
swear that shit wasn't even math.

What, you not talking to me now?
What'd I do?

Watch it.

Say that shit to my face!
Mo.

Watch out!

Mo, chill!

Get off of me! Bitch, if
you don't get off of me...

Mo!
Fuck you!

Calm down.
She started it!

Get the fuck off me!

This is the third
fight this month.

As I've explained to Monique,
she'll be suspended for three days.

She needs a positive outlet
to channel that anger.

I'd love to see her
reach her potential.

She's been given many opportunities, but
I cannot allow this kind of behavior.

What's going
on?Â What's going on...

with the door and the trash?

We gotta go. Come on.

Here we go.

Give me that.

â™ª You're a lot the same â™ª

â™ª But my heart says no â™ª

â™ª No, you're not â™ª

â™ª You're not the same â™ª

â™ª I'm afraid â™ª

Remember when your pops used to make
us wrestle for stupid shit, like...

Happy Meal toys?

You cried like a baby
over that tow truck.

Hey, Mater was the shit.

Besides, you only won
'cause you cheated.

â™ª And so is love â™ª

Hurry up.

You gonna be late.

I told you about coming round here.
Please. Like you own this block.

I'm coming from wrestling
practice, if you so nosey.

Coach sayÂ I'm gonna be
his best lightweight.

They got a girls'
wrestling team?

Nah, I'ma wrestle boys.

Never heard of no girls
wrestling on no boys' team.

Yeah, well... I'm
better than you.

That right?

Come see for yourself.

Cut them nails before
you hit the mat.

'Sup, troublemaker?

Still letting
people on the team?

Practice starts at three.

Gives you exactly four minutes
to stop wasting my time.

You ain't hear me?
Coach, you need anything?

I said, you still letting
people on the team?

It's a boys' team.

Could've fooled me.

Besides, I need a positive
outlet for my anger.

Right, Coach?

No one here's interested
in your games.

You see me talking to you?
Hey.

You wanna try out?

Coach, you ain't serious.
Take a knee. Now.

You seen what she did to my girl?
A knee.

How many of you missed
this morning's run?

Fifty push-ups, now.

One.
Damn! They all get punished?

What you waiting on?

Three, four...

You like your earlobes?
Five, six...

Don't even think about getting
on my mat in those things.

Nine, ten...

Get beat, you a straight bitch.

So how's that my fault?

Remember that one time I took
you to get your hair braided?

You were small, you were
walking around all proud,

like you some type of queen.

The girl across the hall from
your grandma called you ugly.

Gave her a bloody nose, too. Ain't

When I came home and told you,
you slapped me upside the head.

Remember why?

'Cause I ain't raise you...

I gotta find out in the streets.

Still need to lay low.

Yo, what up, shorty?

You gotta think about that?

You don't answer her calls.

Look. Covered in bruises.

Ain't like she think.

She's also missing some jewelry.

I told her I ain't steal

She still got that crazy dog?

Russell? Russell wasn't crazy.
That dog was definitely crazy.

He tried to bite my arm.
I still got the marks.

'Cause you and your cousins
used to try to ride his ass.

Remember that one time
we pinned his ears back?

And you wonder why he bit you.
Shit.

Even a dog got some pride.

We should've never
came back here.

Shit don't always work out
the way it's supposed to.

My boy Jay get out, we gonna

They match the best with the worst
records in the first round.

This kid come in knowing
he got one shot.

It's sink or swim, and this
motherfucker did not want to drown.

Sometimes wanting it
that bad is enough.

Unfortunately, not when you
messing with the king.

As soon as she's mobile, you'll
wanna get those cabinet locks.

Especially in the kitchen.
Yes, yes. I make good.

I don't wanna promise
anything, but...

I think there's a very good chance
you'll be able to adopt her.

There is Monique.

The one in the other room.

Hi, Monique. I'm June,
Nyasa's social worker.

with an electronic toothbrush.

Yo, you ready?
Give me a sec.

What you sulking
for, string bean?

Keep on drinking them protein shakes,
you'll get your glory soon enough.

It's Darrel, right?

I hear she takes after you.

It's in the blood, I guess.

Well, you're a
stronger man than me.

If my daughter wanted
to wrestle, I'd...

Where'd you wrestle at?

Five-six-nine.

I was at collegiate.
Probably before your time.

Oh, yeah, probably.
All right.

We gotta bounce.

I'm taking the team out for a
bite if you'd like to join us.

Unless, uh... there's
somewhere else you gotta be.

Yeah, at work.
I thought we was hanging out?

Maybe later.

But you said we was...
Plans change... Mo.

Besides, team gotta bond and all that.
Ain't that right, Coach?

Yeah.

You got it.

Call me later.

You gotta slow down.
You gonna crash.

I got this.
You gonna crash.

Oh!
I told you.

Game cheated, yo.
I told you.

The problem is your driving's worse
than your wrestling. That's what's...

That's the real deal.

Now what?
You all in my ear.

Get your stink breath out my face.
Then do something.

We about to do a pull-up contest.
You coming?

Yo. I thought you was
gonna pop a wheelie.

Yeah, what happened?

We came for the show.

I told you my brother had a race.
I said that.

Whatever. Mo, you coming?

No, I'ma chill here.
Whatever.

Ooh!

For real, though, we
make it to finals...

it's like a whole bunch
of recruiters that come.

Mm-hm.

Bet you get a scholarship.
Yeah!

Our little prince right here is
gonna get a free ride to college.

Whatever, man. Whatever, man.

You gonna be coming by
my place every weekend

trying to holla at
some college hos.

I will be prying them off my dick, bro.
'Sup, shorty?

You want a ride? Look... Oh.

My bad, he ain't take his meds.

Why you trying to
fuck up my game for?

What game? What game?

Exactly.

Anyway... there's mad women's
teams in college now.

You know?

What's up, beautiful?

No, no, we just chilling.

Where we going?

Just... Just wait. Just wait.
This where Juan do them dog fights?

Nah.

Nah, this the real shit.

All right, y'all. Tonight, we got
three-time Brownsville champ...

It's the real fight right here.

Keisha the Killer. Make
some noise for Keisha!

But don't be fooled,

'cause Miss Lala, she
may look skinny,

but she ain't come all the way
from Flatbush to eat shit.

Give it up for Miss Lala.

Where's the money at?
They boxers?

Show your bets.
Nah, kid, they fiercer than that.

All right, ladies,
center of the ring.

No biting, no scratching, no hair
pulling, no weapons. Got it?

Hey, hey! No hair pulling.
No hair pulling.

Ya'll give it up for
Keisha the Killer!

Go ahead, eat.

That's cool, I can't eat. We
got another match on Saturday.

Malik said there might
be college recruiters.

Oh! Well, if Malik say...

Stop playing.

They got women's teams now.

College cool...

and all that, until you get hit
with real responsibilities.

When your mom passedâ€¦

I did what I had to do. I
didn't have no choice.

Can't wait till I make my own
money, get my own place.

Well, if I could, I'd be in the
ring like them girls tonight.

Them girls on some other shit.

I think that one girl
got her jaw broke.

But you know how much
money they make?

Shit.

You said the money
was good with Juan.

You said you was saving
up for the car wash.

Yeah, well, Jay
didn't make parole.

So, unless I can come
up with his half...

and quick, ain't gonna
be no car wash.

Fuck, Monique!

Shit. The minute I get out, you
in my grill to take care of you.

I told you it ain't like that.
Did you make varsity or not?

Yeah.
Ain't none of them girls

training on no boys'
wrestling team.

You already had an advantage.

You working out with dudes,
and you training with me.

One fight, you can make as much as
I make in a week working the lot.

Fact is...

if I don't come up with ten Gs

in the next two weeks, owner gonna
sell the wash to somebody else. I'm...

I'm doing my part.

We both know what happen if
I keep working for Juan.

Fuck it!

Fuck it. Fuck it.

Fuck it. It's stupid.
I'm stupid.

I'm stupid.

I ain't say...
I shouldn't have took your ass there.

I'm saying the money...
Eat if you gonna eat. Shit. I gotta...

I gotta get back to the lot.

Damn! No wonder you
ain't make varsity.

You wouldn't be starting
if I hadn't let you win.

How come everybody saw
me take your ass down?

Watch his down. Chest
to back, and spin.

Oh, Juan buy you
those kicks, too?

At least my dad comes
to my matches.

Your mom's too busy taking her
clothes off for random niggas.

What?

What's wrong? What?
What, what, what?

She probably hungry.

Nyasa mom here.

What's wrong? You not
happy to see Mommy?

Just...

Black Moon.

Das EFX.

Special Ed? This shit

Who you think put me onto it?

You're a little

Malik call me Mini Mo.

"Malik call me Mini Mo.

Malik say I'm fine."
Ain't even like that.

"Malik say I'm fine."

Whatever. He got a girl anyway.

Hey, listen.

Fuck Malik.

You gonna be a legend.

And not just in some...

high school yearbook.

Make a name out here, ain't
nobody gonna fuck with you.

Come here.

Come here.

Gotta teach you how to duck.

You can leave now.

Ay... Â¿Que te pasÃ³?

Get the fuck out!

Lucila wants you off the team.

You and I both know you didn't get
punched in the face wrestling.

Now, tell me what's going
on with your father,

or I'll pull you off
this team myself.

Ain't got nothing to do with him.
I got beef with some girl.

My dad runs one of Juan's parking lots.
I chill with him sometimes.

He got no place to live,
so he sleeps there.

This girl called him
homeless, and...

I lost my shit.

Just 'cause I messed up,
it ain't the team's fault.

I'm gonna win. We
going to finals.

He's stalling.

He's gonna spank him, bro.

We can bet money, bro.

He got taken down.

This is why I don't
watch white porn.

You are not watching
half the fight, Mo.

We can put money on the fight.

Chris been watching
the whole thing.

What's up with you?
That time of the month?

Why you all...?

Come on. Come on.

How long you been wrestling for?

Since I was ten.

Uncle wanted me to start
boxing, actually.

I got punched in the mouth
one time, and I was like...

"No, thank you."

My nickname was Wrong Way, because
every time a fight broke out,

all my friends running towards the
shit, I'm running the other way.

They got a medical term for that.
It's called no balls-itis.

Yeah, well... when my
dad came back around...

I almost got thrown
off the team.

Tried to work the corners
with him and be tough...

You, dealing? I'd have
loved to see that.

If it wasn't for Coach riding
my ass, showing up to my house,

I would've dropped out.

Coach pay you to tell me that?
What?

Fuck, no.

You sound like one of
them guest speakers.

"Stay in school, kids.
Don't do drugs."

Yeah, well... would've been
one corny ass gangster.

Damn, what do all these
schools want you for?

These the good schools.
'Cause I put in the work.

Not like you. Look at yo ass.
You just faking.

You think you a real wrestler.

Whatever.
You think you're a wrestler.

Now who the king?

â™ª Even when the sky is gray â™ª

â™ª And you feel like â™ª

â™ª There's no way, no, no â™ª

â™ª All you gotta do is â™ª

â™ª Look inside yourself and see â™ª

â™ª See the light, yeah â™ª

I thought you had more class.
Ain't what you think. Nathalie.

It ain't what you think.

How about what I see?
It ain't mean nothing.

What are you talking about?
We don't mean nothing.

Nathalie, just...

You fucked him?
Move out the way.

You know she's pregnant?

I'm not playing.
She was right.

You'll let anybody fuck you.

I'm ready for the real shit.

Gotta get the fuck out of here.

Watch these girls and learn.

The underhook. Fake and set single.
Snap down.

Good. Shuck. Release
that forearm.

Circle. Good, do it again.

Good.

All right. One, two.

That's not an underhook. You
holding hands with him, Tyson.

Who taught you to shuck?
Do it again.

Actually, Coach...

I'm kinda having some...
female issues.

You worried about weight?

Nah, I'll be good if I don't eat.
I just...

What color do you like?

I'm not allowed to have
nails 'cause of wrestling.

I make nice for you.

Good luck for tomorrow.

How come you never
had your own babies?

God no...

God wouldn't let me.

Okay, listen up. Remember...

there's no such thing as losing.

There's only winning...

and learning.

I want you to take pride
in how far you've come,

and have faith in
how far you can go.

All right? Bring it in.

Give me some love.

Winners never quit.
Quitters never win.

One, two, three!

You the queen.

Mo. All right? You gonna be a legend.
Don't worry about all that.

You the queen!

What about my stuff?

Yeah, right over here.

We got the perimeter surrounded.

Wow, look at this.

Jesus.

â™ª The masquerade is over â™ª

What?

What y'all looking at?

One stupid motherfucking
wrestler.

You win?

I taught you good.

Hey.

Keep icing.

You understand I'm legally
obligated to report him?

When I was a kid, I used
to think I was mad lucky.

Most of my friends didn't know
their dad, maybe for like...

five minutes on their
birthday or something, but...

I was living with mine.

I wanted one of those
Razor scooters so bad.

Wouldn't shut up about it.

One day, D brought
one home for me.

Told me... to make sure I only
rode them in Tilden Projects.

But I was mad proud.

Rode that shit everywhere.

One day, this kid
at Marcus Garvey...

seen me with it and
said it was his.

Said he carved his
initials in the handle.

Seen 'em, too.

I told him my dad bought it
new and would fuck him up.

Kid started stalking me.

One day, he seen
me with D, and...

ratted him out to the cops.

They found out he'd been
robbing people for Juan.

You were a kid, Mo.

You're not responsible
for your father.

I'm gonna do right.

I swear, just...

don't make my dad do no
more time 'cause of me.

My mom says you can stay in
Tanya's room as long as you want.

She sleeps in my
mom's bed anyway.

I know. I know.

I'm very sorry for
everything I've done.

And...

you're the only foster
mom never kicked me out.

And...

You be a good girl now.

Quit crying. Come on.
Why you always crying?

Come on, stop crying. Stop crying.
Stop crying.

Shh, shh, shh.

I know. I know. It's all right.

Okay.

She not only let herself down,
she let the whole team down.

So, I put it to the
group to decide.

Should she be suspended
from finals or not?

Omari had't won for her, we
wouldn't even be going to finals.

Yeah, that's true.

Yeah.

Everybody has a right
to make a mistake.

That was a big one.

But we gotta think about
what's best for the team.

It's our first year
going to finals.

And all respect to Omari
for stepping up, but...

Mo's been killing it all season.

Mo...

you have anything to add?

I'm gonna do whatever's
best for the team.

Whatever y'all think that is.

Let's put it to a vote. All in
favor of Mo starting on Friday.

Mo.

Mo.

Monique.

You got my bag?
Why would I?

'Cause you stupid. Check yours.
Mine is missing.

Yeah. You lucky I asked. Would've
had to save your ass. Again.

You lucky you got big feet, or I
would've worn 'em anyway. Now move.

Hey, where you going?
I forgot my bag inside.

Mo.

Nice hair.

Thanks.

Whoo!

Get it, girl!

Girl, this ain't a runway.
Get out of here. Hurry up.

Monique.

You got a match?

Now you the one hard to reach.

Fame getting to you?

Look, I know shit got fucked up.

I felt bad leaving
after the fight.

For real.

But you...

You know I couldn't get caught
near all that. Mo. Mo, I...

I tried to double our earnings.

I was up for a
little while, too.

Mo. Monique.

I just... I just got excited.

That's all.

Seeing you in the
ring, on that mat...

it reminded me of me.
All that flying.

You could do
something with that.

I know.

How about we start
our own thing?

Dude I know, he got
a gym, and we...

Mo.

Monique.

Oh, it's like that now?

Too good for your own pops now?

Jamal here?

All right. Chad? Where's Chad?

Yo, we gonna hook in.
All right, so...

we got one, two, three,
four, five, six,

seven, eight, nine.
Where's Tyson?

Somebody call and see if
he's coming on his own.

I'm not waiting more
than five minutes.

Dad.

All right, don't...

Don't go soft on me now.

How long you had my notebook?

Y'all ready to go to finals?
We're going to finals!

Yeah!

â™ª Trying to find the meaning
of life In a Corona â™ª

â™ª 'Til the Five Percenters rolled
up On a nigga and informed him â™ª

â™ª "You either build or destroy.
Where you come from?" â™ª

â™ª "The Magnolia projects
In the 3rd ward slum" â™ª

â™ª "Hm, it's quite amazing
That you rhyme how you do â™ª

â™ª And that you shine like you
grew up In a shrine in Peru" â™ª

â™ª Drive up on the
curb at a barbecue â™ª

â™ª And hop up out the back
Like, "What's up?" â™ª

â™ª Kill a nigga, rob a nigga
Take a nigga, bust up â™ª

â™ª That's why when you talk that
tough talk I never feel ya â™ª

â™ª You sound real good And
you play the part well â™ª

â™ª But the energy you givin'
off Is so unfamiliar â™ª

â™ª I don't feel ya â™ª

black And then devise a plan â™ª

â™ª Out in London, smokin',
vibin' While I ride the tram â™ª

â™ª Giving out that raw food To
lions disguised as lambs â™ª

â™ª And by the time They
get they seats hot â™ª

â™ª I'm from the corner Where

â™ª To fight and overcome You gots
to keep the proper mindset â™ª

â™ª So what? That won't shake me â™ª

â™ª Out this idea that Iâ€™m striving
Steady climbing for greatness â™ª

â™ª My aspirations Kill my
trials and tribulations â™ª

â™ª The past is in my brain I
use my pain to erase it â™ª

â™ª It's written in the stars
Like Orion's constellation â™ª

â™ª I'll reach my destination
We'll make it, uh â™ª

â™ª Now follow with me As
this world rotates â™ª

â™ª They tried to take me out the
game I had to plan my escape â™ª

â™ª Keep focused, be humble
Stay away from the fake â™ª

â™ª And keep shining,
keep shining What? â™ª

â™ª Represent this to
the fullest, y'all â™ª

â™ª Go, go, go â™ª

â™ª I represent this
to the fullest â™ª
