At 6:08 standard times,
Ukraine's Delta...


Henry, you're holding
the handset too close

to the receiver again!

What I was saying was at 6:08
a.m. Eastern Standard Time,

Ukraine's Delta Observatory

recorded exactly what
you predicted:

an increase in
carbon dioxide and sodium

in the Martian troposphere.

You went to the P.A.
system for that?

Doesn't that confirm it
once and for all?

Well, I'm just looking
at these latest images.

And?

I was correct.

Mount Olympus
is going to erupt today.

See? I told you!

Yeah, it just picked a heck
of a day to do it.

I mean, that confirms it.

I'm just trying to add
a little fanfare, babe.

You just made history!

I mean, an eruption of
Olympus Mons of this size

is unprecedented.

Most scientists thought
the volcano was dormant.

Believe me, okay?
I feel validated.


After 10 years of eye strain
tracking topographical changes

and chemical signatures
on Mount Olympus,

I was not gonna miss this.

I take it Junie
didn't exactly take it okay

when you got called in.

She was livid.

I promised her I'd be
with her today

for her post-surgery
checkup when you called.

I mean, Mark's with her,

but I'm not gonna be winning a
"Stepmother of the Year" award.


Look, I could take over for you.

You could give me a promotion.

I'm tired of hiding
in your shadow anyway.

Yeah, and how would that look?

I can't promote you!
You're my brother!

It would look like
I'm playing favorites.

Yes! You are!

Besides, you owe me!

I owe you?

Absolutely!

All those times
I covered for you.

I turned a blind eye when
you took my Trans Am

out on your little
midnight runs... wink.

All right, not worth
a promotion.

You were 12.

Well, that's weird.

What is it?

Hang on. Let me get this up
on the monitor.

Our telescope
captured these three images

of Mars from 15 minutes ago.

Whoa.

Yeah, you see that?

That ejecta was traveling
incredibly fast.

Is that from
the initial eruption?

Looks like it.

Wow.

The amount of force
to eject something like this

into the Martian orbit
must have been immense.

I mean, at that speed,
solid rock

would have disintegrated
into the atmosphere.

Its outer shell must have some
kind of crystallized element.

You know, now that it's an
asteroid, given its heading,

it could qualify as an NEO.

You want me to sound the alert?


Yeah.

Cc all agencies:
NASA, JPL,

meteorological societies,
everybody.

It's also got this really
weird chemical signature,

some kind of chloride gas.

And a huge draw-down of
nitrogen along its path.

I can't figure out what's
generating the chloride, though.

[beeps]
Wait a minute.

Hang on, these are all
from Washington, D.C.

"All observatories on standby
for military guidance."

Lieutenant, what's our elapsed
time since the I.S.S. impact?

11 minutes, sir.

Oh, boy.

Check the security system.
We've got company already.

Oh, that must be
the military guidance

our alert warned us about.

Any additional intel
from the Pentagon?

No, sir.

Only "Meet Dr. Allison Fisher
at Falcon Observatory

and proceed according
to briefing."

Listen to me carefully.

This is going to
escalate quickly.

This is a threat response
to an incoming asteroid.

Do you understand?
Sir.

The Joint Chiefs did
mention that the nature of the

object remains open
until we can confirm it.

I understand that.

But if our messaging
isn't precise,

every tinfoil hat within
100 miles will be there.

Do you understand?
Sir!

Let's go.

Let's go see what they want?

All right.

I just got an alert.

"The I.S.S. has
fallen off radar"?

What?

There were a dozen
astronauts onboard that.

I worked with those guys
for over a year.

Okay, it might just be a glitch
in the receiver somewhere.

No, no, no, I mean,
I know.

See this reading?

A large object got extremely
close to their sensor.

It's roughly the same size
of the object

we detected from Mars initially.

Hang on!

The trajectory model
just traced its path

over the past few minutes
all the way back to Mars.

This is the exact same
ejecta we just saw.

How can that be?

Come on. That takes 14 minutes
to get a radio signal from Mars.

Are you trying to tell
me something ejected

from Mount Olympus going three
million kilometers a minute?

Well, whether it's
the same object or not,

predictive model gives it
a 50% likelihood

of impact within
1200 miles of the city.

[doorbuzzer sounding]

What can we do for you, si...

Dr. Allison Fisher?

I'm sorry.
What's going on?

This facility is for
authorized personnel only!

I'm General Reed from
Fort Garrison, New York City.

That is Lieutenant Harris.

Okay, hold on.

General, General, we're
doing sensitive work here.

I need confirmation
from Command.

Right.

These are our official orders
and a D.O.D. confirmation

for a national threat.

Here, give me these.

Excuse me, General!

Handing over this facility is
not normally something we do!

I've been briefed on
this facility

and understand that it
is state-of-the-art.

Is that correct?
Yeah.

It's equipped with
nanometric laser guidance

a Deep Field telescopic
range and meteor analysis lab.

That's exactly what we need
to find out what this is,

what it's made of
and where it's headed.

NASA and the other
space stations sent out

a signal barrage with
no response from it, sir.

No response expected,
Lieutenant.

Give the Falcon Observatory
database a security lockdown.

Wait, wait.
What are you doing?

It will take a bit for me to
breach the observatory firewall.

But all live streams are
secure and classified.

You cannot shut down our system!

We need to know what
this object is made of.

We'll have a spectral analysis
of it in a minute.

And what its dimensions are.

Okay. Well, initial data
indicates that it's oblong...

Wait. What did you just do
to our shared database?

We're closing the live
international feed so deployment

of our military assets won't
be compromised to our enemies.

Okay?

We need you to take us to
your Command Center, now.

Christ.

No...

We fall under
the UN Security clause.

All data between observatories
has to flow both ways!

We can't gather data
on a closed system!

Sir, Doctor Fisher
does have a point:

If she receives updates
from observatories further east,

she can precede our
visual confirmation.

Lieutenant, protocol
demands that we do not

advertise orbital security.

Yes, sir!

General, I strongly advise
against locking down our system!

Doctor, I'm aware.

This is a matter
of national security.

General, we have an open
database for a reason!

Our counterparts in Ukraine
were able to stream a burst

of carbon dioxide
and sodium an hour

before we could detect
it ourselv...

Dr. Fisher, it is imperative
that we treat this

for what it is,
a natural disaster

addressed by the
United States military!

General, I need
this database open!

Henry, please advise
your sister not to mistake

her expertise in astronomy
for a command position!

Sir, Henry is
orbital reconnaissance.

I advise him!

I am the lead astronomer
here and this is physics.

The more you devote to
defense against humans,

the less you devote to defense
against this threat.

Now I cannot... I will
not let you in here

until this database is open
and under my control!

It's yours, Dr. Fisher,
it's yours.

Get me an updated heading.

Okay.

I've run an open-source
program to ensure

that this database
remains open... permanently.

Confirmed.
Data is global.

Okay, I'll need
continuous updates.

Hey, I just received an APB.

Space Force and my former
commander are saying

they can't keep up
with this object.

This thing made a
90-degree turn

seconds after entering
the atmosphere.

I don't want to jump
to conclusions here

but anything over a 30-degree
trajectory adjustment,

that's a UFO.

Okay, it's an unusual descent,

but that doesn't necessarily
mean it's a spacecraft.

Oh, that can't be right.

[alarm blares]

This says the object
is slowing down.

JPL and NASA confirm
that the object

is down to 800 kilometers
an hour.

New projected updates,
58% likelihood

it's gonna impact D.C.

Something else has ejected
from the Martian surface.

What?

This says nine objects
flying in a V formation.

Come on, Allie,
these are spacecraft.

Pentagon,
Command Level Omega.

Orbital intel records
incoming, zero-9 objects.

We've received priority alert.

All agencies have confirmed
and all units are activated.

Standing by for
coordinated response.

Okay. Henry, pull up
a trajectory model.

Make it a sliding-base algorithm
based on its current speed.

General, with this object
in our atmosphere

and these nine other
craft on the way,

this is no longer
a natural disaster.

Okay, doctor, get me data
on its propulsion.

The Air Force will need to know

the limits of its
maneuverability.

Run a multi-source algorithm
on a trajectory.

Map it to all known means
of propulsion here on earth.

Done. This algorithm
defaults to zero.

The thermal signature is zero.

I mean, it doesn't have
an atmospheric wake.

It's like it doesn't
have a propulsion system.

Okay. I'm reducing
the polarized filter

and narrowing the lens aperture.

Try it again.

Nothing.

Come on, this telescope
isn't missing anything.

Harris, make sure Command knows
to get those jets in the air.

Sir!

<i>Attention, all units!</i>

<i>This is Command Omega.
We need all birds in the sky.</i>

<i>I need ground units
there five minutes ago!</i>

<i>I repeat, all units, move out.</i>

<i>This is not a drill.</i>

<i>This is B-2 Spirit, en route.</i>

What's our updated ETA?

40 minutes to impact to D.C.

Okay. Spectral imaging
reports are complete

and no traces of ionization.

Thermal imaging
still shows nothing.

Sir, the DOD says
they need immediate intel

on the object's hull.

There's no way to tell,
not yet anyway.

And according to the angle
of its descent,

it's no longer heading
to Washington, D.C.

It's going straight
to New York City.

How can we be certain
these bogeys

aren't from Russia or China?

General, nothing on Earth is
capable of moving that fast

without breaking
the sound barrier.

It's triggered a full
global threat response!

The DOD is sending
Air Force Captain Ogilvy

to manage logistics at
the projected landing site.

These craft could be trying out
the closest viable planet...

Earth.

Look, there are
too many unknowns.

If the Pentagon gives the order,

all military will move
to annihilate it.

Hang on!

It readjusted its heading again!

Okay. Predictive model show
a 91% chance it's going

to land at
Rockefeller State Park.

That's 25 miles north
of Manhattan.

Look, we need firsthand intel
on the ground

to assess its vulnerabilities.

Dr. Fisher? You're the expert
on Mars environment.

What can you tell us
from the field?

I can run telemetric
scans to measure

its structural integrity,

maybe even get some
samples of whatever life form

might be inside.

Hey, look.
I served with Ogilvy.

If anybody's
going to the landing site,

it's going to be me.

What? No.

Henry, you don't even know
what kind of data I need.

You're Recon.
Exactly.

Okay, that's my point.

We have nine incoming craft.

We need to supply real time
scan data to the ground troops.

I can go there.
I can set it up.

I can assess.
I can do the tests.

It's your program.

Given Henry's
prior military status,

it saves us time
getting him clearance.

Doctor, I recommend you help us
track the other nine objects.

You can join your brother after
the landing zone is secure.

Okay, Henry, when you get
to the landing site,

just send us live telemetrics
of the ship's hull's density

and whatever else
might be inside.

I'll keep it on
a continuous scan.

Just be careful.

You're the only brother I got.

Pull back! Pull back!
Let's go!

Fisher, you're with me.
Get back to the perimeter.

Command said that
the Falcon Observatory

was sending you over.

I was wondering how long
it would take for you

to come back to Space Force.

I loved my time on the I.S.S.

But I figured I was
better served in Recon.

Well, you made
the right choice today.

I.S.S. has been destroyed.
We lost over a dozen men.

You didn't know.

Sorry, Henry.

I was afraid that was
the case when we lost contact.

Look, we're gonna
want payback for the I.S.S:

you, me, the DOD.

But honestly it
doesn't make sense

to escalate a fight with
nine incoming craft.

Okay, I'm live here
at the landing site!

It's been over an hour
since I started streaming.

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Get outta here!

Get outta here!
Get out!

This area's closed.
Escort.

See what we're
dealing with here?

I'm telling you,
this whole situation

could blow up in our faces
in a heartbeat.

We're shooing kids out of here,

getting people out of
their houses

while the DOD is holding fire
to cut the risk of retaliation.

If they decide to attack,
what's the plan?

Pull back by 200, artillery.

Then every heavy weapon
we have but a nuke.

And if that doesn't work?

<i>Captain, the Pentagon
says the other nine craft</i>

<i>are incoming northwest,
10 degrees.</i>

Copy, Graves.
Maintain combat formation.

Sustain the perimeter.

If heavy weapons don't work?

I don't know.
Okay?

We've exhausted all
possible signals

and frequencies trying
to contact this thing.

Now I'm down to a
speaker and a spotlight.

Look, I need to
learn everything I can

about the creatures
and their craft.

I need you to get me as close
to that thing as possible.

I can take you to
the front line.

But, remember,
we're going in blind, Henry.

We don't know what could happen.

It's just sitting there waiting.

What do you think?

Listen, you were a scary man
back in basic.

But this?
We don't mess with this.

Get in, get your readings,
get out, okay?

Yeah.

Ready?
Yeah.

I'll take point position.

Sir? I received a request
from 22nd Infantry.

OC says, quote, "General Reed
knows we need to tear

"the throats out of
whatever's on that ship.

Forward the strike
request to Joint Chiefs."

Tell their CO
to hold their fire.

We might be able to deescalate.

Sir.

Dr. Fisher, any updates?

Uh, yeah, uh...

I've got Henry
sending live data.

Looks like radio
waves are nominal,

infrared, thermal,
optical, microwave...

Wait a minute.

We're getting a thermal reading.

There's movement
inside the craft!

Okay.

Remember, if this goes south,

we've got the whole world
ready to toast this thing.

I got soldiers posted there...
there... and there.

News crews are about
two hundred yards

behind us behind a barricade.

Take that as the initial
fallback marker.

<i>This is Pentagon, Omega,
for General Reed.</i>

Go for General Reed!

<i>General, assets will be
engaging the target</i>

<i>before it begins
its next maneuver.</i>

<i>We have an Air Force
coalition running</i>

<i>timed maneuvers spanning
the entire northeast region.</i>

<i>If Falcon detects any further
incoming, we may issue Defcon.</i>

Copy, Omega.

Okay, they're at 28,000 feet.

Now they're circling back
on New York, ETA 28 minutes.

Henry, their ships
are closing in fast!

If you're gonna make contact,
do it now!

Fisher, if we don't hear
from these ships in 30 seconds,

there's a good chance the DOD

will launch a scorched-earth
assault on them.

The line between action and
intel is razor thin here.

Omega, we're standing by.

<i>Copy. Astronomical intel will
guide strategic response</i>

<i>until we decide otherwise.</i>

<i>We cannot afford loss of life
even by an extraterrestrial.</i>

Okay.

Let's try two short pulses
with the light,

then one long pulse.

Okay.

Now try the same
with the speaker.

Pull back! Pull back!


That sound came from
under the ship!

There's something moving
from under there,

but I can't tell what it is.

Thank you.

One of the spaceships
is in the park now.

Dad, when is Allison
coming home?

The news is saying that the
ships actually came from Mars.

Wait. Is Allison still
at the observatory?

That's what I'm trying
to find out, honey.

Hey, how's your leg?

One to 10?

A seven. But, Dad, I don't
wanna stay here.

I'd rather just deal
with it at home.

Is Allison gonna have
to go out there?

No, honey.
She studies planets.

She doesn't have to deal
with anything, you know...

dangerous.

Well, if you talk to her,
can you tell her

that I'm not mad that she wasn't
here while they fixed my leg?

And they're saying that the
spaceships could be hostile.

And just... What if she...

Honey, Allie knows
what she's doing.

She's safe, all right?

And she knows why you're upset.

Dad! Oh, my God!
Look at this!

My God, the ship is opening.

Henry, you need to tell me
what's going on down there now!

<i>There's some kind of opening
in the bottom of the ship.</i>

<i>I think they're
coming out of the ship!</i>

Look, Henry don't do
anything stupid, okay?

Just get the data
and get back here!

<i>Henry, what do you see?</i>


I think they're trying
to communicate with us.

If they act aggressive,
I'm gonna have to open fire.

Just make sure you do
whatever it takes

to get away
and get clear, okay?

<i>Allie, we just made contact.</i>

They're real.

Wait a minute!

That's Uncle Henry!

Captain, get out of there!

Henry, what's going on?

Ogilvy!

<i>Open fire! Open fire!</i>


Ah!

Sir! The craft fired a weapon

and destroyed all of our
ground units completely!

<i>All units! Pull back to
perimeter within one mile!</i>

<i>Get all civilians in
the vicinity inside!</i>

Sir, I have received
confirmation

that everything in
that area is lost!

All the attack helicopters,
all artillery,

and about 100 men...
missing, sir.

Be prepared to evacuate!

Doctor, we need that data now.

Henry, do you copy?

Henry, come in!

<i>Allie, they fired a weapon!</i>

<i>Some kind of laser!</i>

<i>Everything is on fire
right now!</i>

Everything's been vaporized!

<i>Did you get the reading?</i>

Yeah.
Yeah, I got a reading.

It's five times more powerful
than a bolt of lightning.

Their weapon system
is electrical.

They're powering up again.

They're gonna fire their laser
into the sky this time!

Ah!


<i>Henry, were you able to assess
the structure of the craft?</i>

Yes!

They opened a portal of some
kind in the front of the craft,

though it appears seamless.

When the creature
came out, it looks like

they were trying to acclimate
themselves to our environment.

You know, they changed colors,
kind of like an octopus.

Okay.

Look, I ran an initial profile
of the data you sent.

Looks like their hulls appear
to be made of

a calcium, iron, carbon alloy.

It's interacting with some
kind of biological matter.

But it also emitted massive
amounts of chlorine.

<i>But's not producing
any ozone.</i>

<i>Okay, what about the skin?</i>

<i>You said it was changing
colors like an octopus?</i>

Henry?

Henry, come in!

<i>Omega, C-double-zero...
all units!</i>

<i>The target has... the city!</i>

<i>All nine targets are descending
to 50,000 feet...!</i>

<i>Theta Command,
NASA, Falcon,</i>

<i>pull back to
Bravo Point Garrison!</i>

Sir, they're scrapping
field reconnaissance

and ordering all posts
to fall back.

Doctor, you should pack up
whatever provisions you need

and leave with us immediately.

General, I can't leave with you!

If you want me to stay
and process data,

I need the telescope,
the imaging programs,

the laboratory!

Doctor, this city,
this whole area,

may be reduced to ashes soon.

They're starting
to evacuate the city now.

But my family is in the city.
I can't leave them.

I understand, but you're
a mission critical resource.

I can't let you just go out
into an active military zone.

Well, you're not
detaining me, are you?

No, absolutely not.
You are a civilian.

You're under no obligation
to follow orders.

I am imploring you,
work with me

and you will save lives.

I'm sorry, General.
I can't go with you.

Look, I can pack up
some equipment

and set up a makeshift lab
once my family's safe

and out of the city.

But I can't go with you.

Okay, look.

Take your radio,
stay in contact with me.

Do what you can.

Any info you can give
to me will be helpful.

Okay.

Let's go!

<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

<i>Are you and Henry safe?</i>

Henry was at the landing zone.
He made it out alive.

I'm heading over
to pick you up right now.

If the other spacecraft
head to the city

and something happens
to either one of us...


Is Junie okay?

<i>Yeah, she's doing better,</i>

<i>but I think her leg is
still bothering her.</i>

Getting her in and
out of the cab this morning

didn't help either.

Well, let her know I'm coming
to pick both of you up.

<i>I'm going to take you guys
to the bunker</i>

<i>at your family's farm.</i>

So we're evacuating then?

<i>Yes, we're evacuating asap!</i>

<i>Look, have her ready,
I'm almost there.</i>

Okay. Hey, listen.

Be careful.

I love you.
<i>I love you.</i>

<i>All stations prepare to move
all non-critical patients...</i>

Dad, what's going on?

We gotta get out of
here right away.

Is Allison coming?

Yep, she's on her way right now.

And we're gonna go
to Grandma and Grandpa's farm

until it's safer to come back.

You ready?
Hold on to me.

Falcon intel?
This is Fisher. Do you copy?

Falcon, this is Fisher.
Do you copy?

I was worried you weren't
gonna make it back.

There are a lot of
people working really hard

to make sure all of us are okay,
including me.

Hey, Allie, you really
think running into gridlock's

the best way to go?

Honey, I hear what
you're saying,

but staying here is not
gonna help us either.

You see what they did?

Yeah, I did.
We both did.

We gotta get out
before they lock us down

and the ships start
attacking the city.

How's your leg?

I'm doing okay right now.

They only had to put
in four more pins.

Only four, huh?

If I move too quick,
it's like a stabbing pain.

We're gonna get you somewhere
safe and sound.

And promise me you're not
gonna do any more rail slides

off of three flights
of stairs?

Okay, it's called a grind

and it was only one flight
of stairs, and I promise.

Are we even gonna
make it out of here?

Yeah. We'll be okay once we get
past the Queensboro Bridge.

They're they are!

They're flying in formation.


Dispatch! This is Captain Fisher
from Falcon intel!

Come in!

<i>Captain, this is
Command Dispatch.</i>

<i>[static]
We... all incoming...</i>

Command Dispatch,
this is Captain Fisher.

All of our transport's
been destroyed!

We need Evac now! Come in!

<i>This is General Reed.
Go for Henry Fisher.</i>

This is Fisher!
Go, go!

<i>Presence of the nine
of craft is creating</i>

<i>an electromagnetic
disturbance...</i>

Get out now!
Get out now!

Please, this is our only
way out of the city.

Get out, both of you, now! Now!


You okay?

Yeah, okay.
Are you okay?

Hey, are you heading south?

I'm sorry. We can't take
you where you need to go.

Rebecca, we need to get
to my mom.

Come on!
No, no, no, no!

This is my ID right here.

I'm a former military officer.

Please. I just came
from the landing site.

I work in an observatory!

We're doing research
on the attack.

Please?

He did just stop us
from getting mugged.

But you said
we're out of gas.

We're not stopping for gasoline!

Okay, get in.
Thank you.

<i>The first ship to land
just joined the other nine.</i>

You guys, look at this.

<i>I'm so scared.
I don't know what to tell you.</i>

They made it into the city.

There's no way of
attacking them now

without endangering everyone.

<i>I've seen like 50 fighter jets
keep circling around.</i>

<i>I don't know what
they're gonna do.</i>

<i>People are, like, evacuating.</i>

<i>The city is in chaos!</i>

The bunker is around back.

Well, make yourself at home.

You okay?
Yeah.

Do you really think we're
gonna be able to stop them?

Don't worry about that
right now, okay?

The military is doing
everything they can

to keep us safe
and I'm trying to help.

What are you setting up?

A lab, kind of
like we have at work.

It doesn't look
like much of a lab.

Oh, yeah?
How many labs did you bring?

What is that?

This is a picture of what
NASA believes to be

bacteria taken from the sample
from our Mars Rover Opportunity.

And this is from
the meteorite that hit earth

about a year ago verified
to be from Mars.

And this is a picture of the
ship's hull taken this morning.

When I saw the hull,
I wanted to compare them.

They all look the same.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's because
the ship's hull

is an iron, calcium,
carbon protein alloy.

And then both
the Rover sample

and the meteorite samples
show these vacuoles of calcium

left behind from some
unidentified chemical process.

But see, this calcification
process occurred

extremely rapidly.

I mean, over days, not years.

I think the aliens
might have sent this meteorite

to test how our atmosphere
would affect them.

Which could give us clues
on how to stop them.

Allison, look at this!

What's... What's going on?

What's that?

The car's dead.

It's an electromagnetic pulse.

Luckily this device
is shielded from EMPs.

Yeah, but why are they shooting
straight up into the sky?

Well, their weapons give off
a huge electrical charge.

But I mean,
it could be deliberate,

to give off those EMPs,

to knock out electricity
as far as possible.

Allie? Come in, Allie.
This is Henry.

Looks like they're headed east.
Can you confirm that?

Allie?

Any signal?
Nothing.

It's dead.

Did you see that?

Our weapons barely
scratched them!

Yeah, it's like
they have some sort of shield.

You know, Henry managed
to get a reading from

the actual blast off
the ship's heat ray.

He said the charge
was electrical,

but didn't generate any ozone.

Isn't that the smell you
get after a lightning strike?

Yes, that's right.

But it generated
a ton of chlorine.


Okay.

All right, so they fire
electricity straight up

into the air
not to create ozone

but because they know
will interact with the sodium

in our water vapor
in our atmosphere.

They're trying to create
their own chlorofluorocarbons

to destroy our ozone layer!

Yeah, but why would
they want to do that?

Because Mars doesn't
have an ozone layer.

They know they won't
survive unless they can

turn earth into
a new Mars!

I mean, the ozone elimination,
the nitrogen depletion,

thinning of the atmosphere?

That's why they have
the energy shields!

Because they know that
their organic systems

will most likely fail when
exposed to our atmosphere,

leaving behind calcium deposits

just like the ones
in that picture!


All the electronics were knocked
out by an electromagnetic pulse.

How could an electromagnetic
pulse knock out my car?

I don't get it.

Look, a pulse like that
is far-reaching.

It affects the earth's
magnetic field.

It's like a solar flare
or an atomic bomb.

You're not saying they detonated
a nuclear weapon, are you?

Oh, no, no.

They would have taken us
out with that.

Listen, the Department
of Defense is trying

every tactical maneuver to
come up with a good defense.

Dropping a nuclear bomb
on New York City

doesn't make
any sense right now.

My mom's in a nursing
home on the island.

Alina...

That smell is much
stronger out here now.

Are we getting
poisoned right now?

No, listen.

Given their advanced technology,

if they were really gonna
deploy some sort of agent,

it would have killed us already.

Look, if we can make
it to the observatory,

it's protected by the military.

And once it's safe,
we can go find your mom.

Alina, you saw the video
of what that ship

did to those helicopters.

Now there's 10 of them.

Well, we have no radio.
The car battery's fried.

The observatory's only
a few miles away.

It's time to start walking.

Thank you for helping us
to the observatory.

And thank you for
helping us back there.

Thanks for giving me a ride.

I just don't understand
why they're attacking us.

Well, since there haven't
been any more than

the initial 10 aircraft,

I suspect they're using
New York City

as a trial run for
a much larger attack.

If that's the case, that means
they intend on staying here.

And if they intend on
staying here,

they're gonna have
to make this place a lot more

habitable like Mars.

How do you
know they're from Mars?

We confirmed it through our
telescopes at the observatory.

Their ships produce a chloride
gas which kills nitrogen.

If they wanna make
this more habitable,

they're gonna have to make
our atmosphere ozone-free.

But that would take
a long time, wouldn't it?

'Cause there's only
10 of them, right?

Not necessarily.

I mean, their ships produce
a chlorofluorocarbon gas.

This gas rapidly destroys
our atmosphere.

And if they're gonna make earth
more habitable like Mars,

they're gonna have
to eliminate the ozone

and leave nothing but oxygen.

And that would affect the mass
of the entire planet?

That can't be possible.

If they ignite the oxygen,
it will burn off the oceans.

And the earth is mostly ocean.

Which would make
the Earth's gravitational pull

the same as Mars.

I can't get what I need here.

I have to go back.

What are you doing?

I need to go to the observatory.
It's the only way.

What?

Look, we're safe here
for a while,

but not forever,
and not for long.

They had troops, Air Force,
heavy weapons

all surrounding them,
all firing at them

trying to stop them,
and it did nothing.

Allie...
And now they are on the move

and we don't know where
they're going or how fast

or what else they can do.

But we know they want to wipe us
out, as much as possible.

Someone's gotta stop them.

Allie...

I have to stop them.

Allison, you cannot
go back out there!

Listen, when they
evacuated us this morning,

I wanted the military
just to wipe them out!

I thought they would,
but they didn't.

Look, they sent one of their top
generals to me this morning

because NASA doesn't even know
what they're doing.

They consulted me.

The only way to make
sure the aliens

don't get to you and Junie
is to stop them!

I have been studying
Mars my entire life.

I can beat them.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

Allie...

The car's parked underground.

It shouldn't have been
affected by the EMP.

Allison, no!

Honey, I know, okay?
I know.

But we have to be strong to get
through this together, okay?

Yeah.
Okay.

You guys will
be safe here, okay?

I love you.
I love you.

I am coming back.

[sirens blaring]

Sir, I can't get

our communication systems
back online.

We need to establish a new
perimeter outside of the city.

No. No.

You saw the footage
with your own eyes.

Our troops were routed every
time they went to engage them.

Sir... the D.O.D. has evacuated
several military installations

throughout New York State,

with transport straight
to the Pentagon.

We may want
to consider doing the same.

Did they evacuate this one?

No, sir.

It's just that some of the
other officers recommended...

What? What?
That we evacuate?

Sir.

Until the Pentagon gives
the order, we stay!

You saved the data from the
observatory, pull it up.

Yes, sir.

Lieutenant...

Lieutenant, listen to me.

We can run.
I hear you.

We can run or we can stay

and defend peoples' lives.

These creatures have
an energy shield.

Nothing would through it,
but it isn't perfect.

I don't care what enemy
we're dealing with.

No one has unlimited resources.

We will find out
their imperfection

and we will use it
to destroy them.

This is Fisher to Falcon
Observatory!

Fisher to Falcon Observatory!

Come in, Falcon!



[howling, explosions]

Sir!
Sir, excuse me.

Ma'am, what are you doing here?

I have to get back...

New York is under a mandatory
evacuation or shelter in place.

There's no foot
traffic through here!

I have business with General
Reed at the Falcon Observatory.

I'm Dr. Allison Fisher.

This is an active war
zone admitting

only authorized personnel.

Okay.

The observatory's
quite a way away,

probably another five miles.

Has anyone been able to
reestablish communication?

There's some generators,
most of them fried.

But we were able to charge up
some of the radios.

They're huddling back up.

They split apart, attack us
and huddle back up.

They're Tripods, That's what
the Command called them.


Easton?
What do you see?

They're about two miles out
from me, Sergeant.

I saw them just above
the tree line.

Yeah.

They started attacking
some residential areas.

It was a slaughterhouse.

We weren't able
to retreat fast enough.

Planes dropping out of the sky,

bodies everywhere like shadows.

Ashes everywhere.

You heard the radio.
It's about two miles that way.

What's your business
with the general?

I... I have to get
to the observatory.

I have intel on the Martians
that might help us

develop a weapon
to use against them.

But I have to get to the
observatory lab to run the test!

This is Sergeant Holleran
to Intel One.

<i>Intel One, go!</i>

I have Dr. Allison Fisher
from Falcon requesting

transpo to the theater.

<i>The enemy got within
three hundred yards</i>

<i>of the observatory
about an hour ago.</i>

<i>Without planes or satellites,
we can't tell if</i>

<i>the observatory's
still standing.</i>


Sergeant, have any
of your units been able

to inflict damage
on the Tripods?

Not that I've seen,
but we'll get them.

We're sending in some big tanks
with big guns

like you've never seen before,
heavy-duty stuff,

top secret stuff.

I need you to take me
straight to the front line.

Trust me, you don't want to see
what those things can do.

I know exactly what they can do!

Right now, I need to get
close enough to study them

to get a good idea
how they operate,

what their weaknesses are.

Otherwise, there's
a good chance our weapons

won't even scratch them.


We have to move now!

Look!

They're powering up again.
Get down!

They're gonna fire into
the atmosphere!

Get down!
Get down!

Stay back.
Stay right there.

They're spreading apart
right now, you see?

They're about to attack.

I don't get it.

Our weapons are not
even affecting them!

They will.
We have more coming in.

You have to stay here,
stay safe.

You have to make it
to the observatory.

Wait, wait!
Where are you going?

Those are my men.
I gotta do my part.

Wait, no!

Oh!

Are they going to fire again?

Run! Go!
[screams]

Please!
Help me, please!

Get it off me!
Help me, please!

Come on.
Get it off me!

Please get it off me, please!
Pull, pull!

Get it off me!
Get it off me!

Please, get it off me!
Pull!

Get it off me!
Ah!

Go, go!
Come on.

Those creatures or whatever
they were,

how were they able to
take down an entire bridge?

Seemed like they were
drawn straight to us,

like they were trying
to kill us!

Okay, hold on.

I think they're drawn
to anything organic.

You see, it's like a
Kudzu vine on steroids.

Wait. What does that mean?

When I was stationed in Japan,

they had these vines,
these Kudzu vines.

And the locals had
to constantly prune them down

or kill them,
or anything.

Otherwise, they would
overtake the village.

So the Martians planted
an invasive species?

They're trying to.
That's basically it.

By feeding on nitrogen,

they could have this placed
terraformed in a week.




Just stick to the tree line
and be quiet.

Run!

Come on!


Come on! In here!
Come here, come here!

Go! Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

That way.
That way... now!


Come on! Get inside!
Get inside!

Get cloth under the door!
Block the windows!

There's still people out there!

Open the door!
No! Don't open it!

Don't open the door!

What do we do now?

I don't know, but I have
to get to the observatory

or all of this data
is for nothing.

Play the footage
from Central Park again.

You can see it.
Here.

An F-35 collides
with the shield.

No effect on the spacecraft.

Wait. Stop right there.

What's that?

It's an interference pattern
on the screen.

It can't always
handle high-resolution images

from the observatory.

It stops right
beyond the spacecraft.

What's the resolution
on this laptop?

1080.

And these are interference
wavelengths, Lieutenant?

The energy shield is vibrating
at an incredibly high frequency.

If conventional weapons won't
work in a frequency this dense,

then not even radiation
will break through.

We'd need something measuring
400 kilojoules at least,

and an ultrahigh Hertz.

We have laser weapons both here
and at the Pentagon, right?

All our military-grade
laser weapons

have been disabled from the EMP.

The Falcon Observatory
has a laser.

Can it be modified
to fire on them?

Theoretically, we could route
all the energy to the laser

and recalibrate it to fire at
an extremely high frequency.

But all the observatory systems
are shut down

because of the EMP.

Doesn't matter.

Send a priority alert
over their network

repeating every 15 minutes.

Give them the specifications.

Let's just hope one of them,

you know, makes it back
in time to receive it.

Sir.

Hey, hey, hey!
Over here, over here.

Get down!

I know where there's shelter.

I'm Chris.
Allison.


Those are the others.

We were on the south bridge
when these gigantic red vines

pulled the whole bridge down.

Me and a few others made it out.

But the machines, they just
kept following

and killing us in herds.

They've been hunting and
killing us since the bridge.

They followed us right into the
trees and started eating us.

Wait. That's...

That's why they didn't
just start

spraying the planet
and planting.

They don't have any food,

so they have to eat us
to keep going.

You said the vines were red
and they move independently?

Yeah.

They just kept...


There it is.
We're almost there.

Okay, let's go.

Hey, Chris?
What are you doing?

I'm an aircraft mechanic.

I worked for a company in
New Mexico for over 30 years.

The engine looked intact
from outside.

The fuel gauge would show
empty if there's a leak.

This plane's off because a
circuit was broken on impact.

And generally, there's
a small tool kit

up above the copilot side
for emergency fixes.

And if you can give me a
hand and maybe it moves off...

you can seal the connection
to the fuel regulator.


Chris, keep it down.

I'm pretty sure they're gone.


Please, please,
please, please.

Chris, they're right outside.

Okay, quick!

Shut all the blinds!


Keep it down!

Don't let them hear us.

What's it doing?

It's just standing there.

The sun's starting to go down.

It's not even moving.
It's just...

It's like it's
standing at attention.

I can't stay here.

I've got
to get to the observatory.

But I know if one of us
goes out there,

it's just gonna pick us
right off on the grass.


Well, we can't just leave it out
there waiting for it to kill us.

It's just like
it's guarding the plane.

We're just going to have
to stay here until it leaves.

Try to keep quiet.

Hey.

Where are you going?

Chris?

Chris?

What are you doing?

Looks like they got
cold turkey sandwiches.

Want one?

Kinda.

Thanks.


The cockpit radio's broken,

but I think I can fix
a couple shorted wires.

Lets wait until
they're gone to do that.

It's a good idea, though.


Things hurting
pretty bad, huh?

Yeah. It still hurts pretty bad.

Okay, hang on.

Here.

Here.
Lift your arm.

It still stings.

You think those Tripod
creatures sleep?

Just close your eyes.

Try to get some rest.

I'll take the first watch.

No, no.
I'll do it.

You're with
the Defense Department.

You'll need to focus.

I'll take the first watch

I'll wake you up
in a few hours.

Thanks.


[boom]
What was that?

It's moving again!

And it just fired
at something outside!

Chris!

Chris, no!
We gotta go!

I fixed the plane and we ain't
going out without a fight!

Let's see them stop
a flying missile!

No, Chris, stop!

Shit!


Sure you're all right?

Yeah. You know I can't
just lay there.

I'll drive me insane.

Well, just watch the leg then.

I don't know what the hell
those things did,

but the wiring around
the house is totally fried.

Even with the generator,
it's gonna take days

before I can get this
place back up and running

without an electrician.

Well, I'm sure Uncle Henry
could fix it.

Yeah. I could do it too if I had
all the time in the world.

So, what?
Your schedule's packed now?

Totally packed.


Hey, take it easy, will you?

I don't want you
to hurt yourself again.

I mean, I know you're bored

and you want to help out,
but you don't have to rush.

Do you think Allison's
gonna be okay?

I hope so, Junie.

We'll just have to wait
'til she gets back.

She'll make it back.

Oh, my God!

It's an arm from one
of the machines!

Get down! Get on the floor.

[glass breaks]


Junie, did it hurt you?

No. I'm fine.
It didn't hurt me.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I am.

It sounded like something
was calling to it.

Either way, Dad,
you saved my life.

That was incredible.

Just get some rest.


The smoke's cleared.

Now, the observatory's
a mile down the main road.

I'm sorry.
We can't go with you, Henry.

Even if there might
still be danger in Manhattan,

we have to go there.

Thanks for helping me.

Thank you for helping us.

Be safe.




Ah!

Ah!

Allie?

Are you in here?

Allie, this is Henry.

Come in.

Allie, this is Henry!
Come in!

[jets flying]

Stay where you are,
wherever you are.

Please, just give me something,
give me something!

I need to know you're there!

Allie...

I'm going
to the engine room.

I'm gonna check the lighting.

Ha!

[glass breaks, clatter]

Allie!
Henry!

Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you made it.

Where are Junie and Mark?
Are they okay?

God, I hope so.

I had to leave them
at the farmhouse.

I haven't been able
to check on them.

But, Henry, I saw one.

I saw one of the Martians.

Outside the machine?

No, face-to-face,
just outside their cockpit.

Wait. Have you seen
the red weeds?

Yeah. One of them tried
to choke me out

in the middle of the woods.

They tried to kill us
on the south bridge.

Who's us?

Well, I spent the day yesterday
traveling with two girls.

We traveled together, then
I spent the night in a cabin.

Where did you guys hide out?

Long story.

But you know what
the Martians are doing, right?

Yes. They're trying to change
earth into a new Mars.

They're trying to destroy
all the nitrogen

in the atmosphere by planting
nitrogen-gobbling crops.

Once they're down to
nothing but oxygen,

they'll ignite the atmosphere

and that's going
to vaporize the ocean.

That reduces earth's mass!

Yeah, and that, in addition to
breaking up our ozone layer,

ought to make our planet
pretty much like home to them.

Okay.

So I took this
specimen about an hour ago

and it's jet black, right?

If my theory is correct,
when it's exposed to bacteria,

it'll turn white and die.

I saw it happen to this Martian

that consumed a man
with a badly infected arm.

Eww.

Yeah, it just turned bone white
and died within minutes.

[ping]
Is that an alert?

I opened the message board,
it's from 12 hours ago.

Here, hold on.
The whole system is scrambled.

I have to let it run
before I can restart it.

All right.

So Mars has half the oxygen
content than earth does.

So its species have
to over-produce hemoglobin

to take in as much oxygen
as possible.

So like our blood, the iron is
critical for oxygen absorption.

So they create twice
as much of it.

Now you were able to run
a scan on their skin

before the first attack,
remember?

Yeah.

It was calcium, carbon,
protein and iron.

Now I suspect when
these creatures die,

their vascular system seizes,

and then drains all
the iron from its body.

Sort of like how our
lymphatic system pushes fluid.

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

So all we have to do
is isolate what bacteria

the Martians are susceptible to.

When the iron drains,

it's just gonna
leave the calcium,

turning them bone white.

Just like when they retreated
back into the ship, right?

That's right.

So we can ID them one by one
with the library's ID function

until we identify
which bacterium

is acidic enough to
kill the living skin tissue.


All right, Yeah, how do we
know that's even gonna work?

Because their
vascular structure

is a closed system
just like ours.

They need twice the iron to
deliver oxygen on Mars, right?

Okay.

So that's twice
the red blood cells.

That'll only leave half
the room for white blood cells.

Henry, they have
no immune system.

Okay, so I've separated
a single bacterium.

You run the program and
tell me how it identifies it.

Okay, got it.

The program says...
Clostridium perfrigens.

Common name is gangrene.

That's perfect.

The alien I took the sample off
of died seconds later.

So it's must have only had
trace amounts of gangrene.

Okay, that's not it.
That's not it.

Let's try again.

All right, let me get
another sample up here.

Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

Okay, this one
is Pleomorphic bacteria.

That's just common
blood-borne bacterium.

All right, here goes nothing...

and it did nothing.

There's got to be at
least 12 strains

of bacteria on this sample.

[explosion]
Oh, Jesus.

They're getting closer.

Can we do three or
four of these at a time?

No, unfortunately not.

That would compromise
the results.

Okay, go!

Okay, That is...
streptococcus.

That's the common strep.

All right.

That's it!
That's it.

Well, okay, no,
that's just the first sample.

That's just the control.

Now I've gotta reproduce
the experiment.

And...

That's it! Right there!
There it is.

It's the strep.
Oh, God!

[explosion]
Jesus.

<i>This is U2 Spirit, over.</i>

<i>Is anyone else still flying?</i>

<i>Copy, Spirit.
This is Rex, over.</i>

<i>Copy, Rex, I have
visual on the Tripods.</i>

<i>Payload is primed.</i>

<i>This close to the city?
Are you sure?</i>

<i>Rex!</i>

<i>That's it! Weapons hot!
Let's smoke these bastards!</i>



What we got?

Okay. Well, that's
from the last EMT.

I mean, it glitched
the whole system.

It's still formatting.

What's it say?
It's four columns.

The first one is 400, 400.

That's just over and over again.

And KJ, KJ, repeat KJ.

Okay, that's kilojoules.

Boom.


Oof.

Okay, that's definitely
a fire fight.

They're definitely
getting closer.

Would imagine there are
troops on the ground

that are probably just
trying to hold their position.

What's the third column say?

181818 and then khz, khz.

That's kilohertz.

So they're talking about
the heat ray?

No. This is five times the
strength of an electrical bolt.

Electricity doesn't
cycle that fast.

This is light-based.

Okay, so what were they
saying about kilojoules?

Well, the 400 is 400.

The 18 is five times the
frequency of a light ray.

If they're not
talking about a heat ray,

they're talking about a laser.

Okay, okay, and the last column?

Just "Reed" over and over again,
every 15 minutes for hours.

The fact that there's
a frequency

that's corresponding to
a high-powered laser tells me

this is a weapon
we can use against the aliens.

So if we max out our laser,

we could penetrate
their energy shields.

I mean, theoretically.

I mean it could.

It could, it could, it could.
It could!

Ours is designed
for guidance, though.

I mean, it's not
meant as a weapon.

We could maybe get one,
maybe two, shots off.

Then the whole thing's
just gonna melt down

and we'll be sitting ducks.
Right, right, right.

Okay, if you could fire on
one of them and breach its hull,

I could use their smoke delivery
system and fire on the rest.

You mean climb
inside the machine?

Yeah.

When I took the sample
from the alien,

I saw the smoke container
in its cockpit.

I could use the reagents
to make a lethal dose.

I think 500 parts per
milliliter should do it.

Yeah, I could spray it into
the smoke delivery system

in the Tripod and then fire
on the rest of them.

Oh, God!

We may deploy their smoke,
that will kill you.

No. We have all this
lab equipment.

We got chemical
protective masks.

We have the sprayer
we spray on meteorites.

We could protect ourselves.
Okay.

Here.

Fill this up to the top.

By the time they get here,
we will generate enough.

Okay.

And working.

I wish we could do something
to lure them right here.

Use the PA system.

You get the mic close enough
to the receiver, it feeds back.

You think that's gonna work?

It's not gonna sound human.

That's strep,
be careful of it.

Let's give it a shot.

All right, let's see if
they take the bait.



<i>It's on its way.</i>

Allie, the power to
the laser is on maximum.

Power resources say
it's gonna hold.

<i>I can see it!
It's just over the tree line!</i>

<i>I'm driving the solution,
heading outside!</i>

Shit!

Allie, don't go!
It's not holding!

The circuit didn't hold!
Don't go! Hold still!

Henry, we don't have much time!

They're gonna be within range to
fire their heat rays any second!

Okay...


Okay, I rerouted all
the power from everything

that is not the laser.

I mean, there's no telling
how many times

I can fire this thing
before it just blows up.

<i>Just do it.
It's all we got.</i>

What's their trajectory?

<i>Aim the laser directly east.
You'll see it any second.</i>


Henry, it's here.

God.

I got it.

I got it, I got it, I got it.

Yes!


Allie, are you there?
I just wanna hear from you.


Ready to fire.

Henry!

Aah!


Oh!

Ah!




No!

Over here!

Come on, over here!

Come on, you son of a bitch!

General Reed!
General Reed!

Over here!

Their shields are down!


Here!

No! Over here!


We saw the laser firing on the
ridge all the way from the base!

We knew you were trying
to take them out!

Keep circling!
Over here!

Over here!
Over here!

Guys, look at me!




Come on.

Ugh! Oh!


Allie!

Allie!

Come here.

I knew you could do it.

Come here.
Come here, sit down.

I told you, you're
the only brother I got.

We did it!
I knew we would!

You're pretty smart.
Runs in the family, I think.

Shut up, Henry.

You made it.
Thank God.

Wait, Junie!

Is Junie okay?

Mom!
Baby.

I was afraid you
weren't gonna make it back!

How's your leg?

It's better.
Everything feels better.

I agree, everything
feels better.

Hey.
How are you doing?

Oh my God.
