Hello.

Why don't you answer?

Get out of there!

Um, I don't...

They'll...your leg...

''Out of Range''

Get away!

They'll cut off your leg!

''Ashikari, Help!''

''X-CROSS''

Hello? Hey, how are you?

I'm heading to
the hot springs with a friend.

''Chapter One''

''The white cell phone,
in the closet.''

Oh, really? Too bad.
Invite me again sometime.

Yeah, yeah.

Bye.

Hey, are you sure
this is the right road?

I don't know, probably.

What do you mean ''probably''?
Read the map!

Shiyori, Blood type A,
Luckiest week for love.

You may meet your soul mate.
Go for it!

Blood type B...
''Watch for stalkers''?

Oh, too bad.

Exactly how many guys
are you dating, Aiko?

Three...No, make that four.

Are you really in love
with all of them?

Well, I guess, sort of.

''Sort of'?

I don't want to get hurt
the way you did.

Meaning?

''Sort of' is better to
not get hurt.

Keep a certain distance
and nobody gets hurt.

Is that true for me, too?

What?

Am I just a ''sort of' friend
to you?

Hey, don't get all serious on me.

Watch out!

Ouch...

Hey, what are you doing?

Snip, snip, snip...

Snip, snip, snip...

Hell.

Have you ever seen
the true face...

of hell?

Snip, snip, snip...

Hey, the reception here sucks!

How's yours, Shiyori?

Mine's out of range, too.

Here's a map.

We're here now.

-The inn?
-Here?

The baths!

It's still a long way to the inn.
How will we get there?

What'll we do?

Hello?

You're guests at
the hot springs inn?

Welcome to Ashikari village.

Please, get in the car.

Please, please.

Let's go.

Don't be shy.

Welcome, welcome.

Thank you for coming
such a long way to visit us.

Welcome.

''Welcome to Ashikari village''

Thank you for visiting us.

This is a pretty fancy inn
for the middle of nowhere.

All the villagers built it
together to welcome our guests.

The villagers?

We've been loggers
for generations.

How many people
live in this village?

(Ashikari dialect)

Excuse me?

That's why,
it's just us old folks here now.

''Asamiya Keiichi''

I'll leave
your bathing gowns here.

May I serve dinner
after your bath?

Yes.

The hot springs are relaxing.

Please take care to
wash your legs.

We landed in one helluva place.

-It didn't matter where...
-What?

So long as
it was far away from him.

Is it really over?

So he cheated on you once.
It's no big deal

You wouldn't understand.

What?

You've never really
cried over anyone.

You date all those guys.

I don't even want you
to understand how I feel.

He was my very first boyfriend.

So what?

I'm going back to the room.

Hello, it's me.

Shiyori just left the baths.

Yeah, everything's on schedule.

''Shiyori, let's talk.
Please answer. Keiichi''

Shiyori!

Shiyori!

Hello?

Why don't you answer?

Get out of there!

Um, I don't...

They'll...your leg...

''From Mononobe Akira''

Get away!

They'll cut off your leg!

How was your bath?

Lovely, thank you.

Please eat your dinner
while it's hot.

Call me on the house phone
when you finished the dinner.

Thank you.

Hello?

What's wrong? What happened?

No, not really.

Get out of there now!

If they catch you,
they'll sacrifice you.

Is this a prank call?

This isn't even my cell phone.

Who are you?

I am...

You're not Shizuka?

No, I'm not.

Why, why do you have
my sister's phone?

I'm staying here with my friend.

I found this cell phone
in the closet.

Oh, no...

Don't tell me Shizuka's already...

-What is this?
-What happened?

Suddenly, all the lights went out.

I get it. They've finally done it.

Who's they?

Who are you? What's going on?

Dear guest,
have you cleaned your leg?

About the power failure,
there's no need to worry.

I'll be there right away.

Don't bother, I'm going to bed!

What did you mean when
you said they'd sacrifice me?

I'm not sure you're going
to believe what I have to say.

Go ahead, tell me.

I'm Mononobe Akira.

I'm researching folklore
at Jonan University.

-Folklore?
-Yes.

In ancient Japan,

they used to sacrifice
young women,

in order to ward off disasters.

They used to in Ashikari village,
where you are now.

Originally, Ashikari was
a loggers' village.

In order to prevent their wives
from fleeing the village...

while the men were cutting
down trees in the mountains,

they cut off
their wives' left legs.

That's how this grim
tradition began.

Eventually, the villagers captured
traveling women,

offering them as living sacrifice
to the mountains.

The sacrificed women...

were locked up in a shrine
on the mountain.

To this day, they've secretly
kept the tradition alive.

You've seen how
all the villagers limp?

As soon as a baby is born, they
cut the tendons in the left leg.

To brand them...

and to keep them
from running away.

lmpossible!

I know you
don't want to believe it.

But you saw for yourself.

All the scarecrows
around the village.

They're not decorations.

They're mummies of the dead women,

worshiped as gods.

Watch out!
The rituaI's already begun!

Oh, goddess!

I've brought you a light.

It's dangerous in the dark.

Dear guest.

What's going on?

Hello? hello?

Hello.

Please tell me your name.

I'm Mizuno Shiyori.

Shiyori.

I want to help you.

Either you believe what I told you
or they cut your leg off?

The choice is yours.

Hello, hello, Mononobe!

Please, wait!

Are you all right?

If you won't open the door,
I'm coming in.

Not this one.

Why don't you answer, Aiko?

''It's awful! Contact me now.
Shiyori''

Please, Aiko, answer! Please!

''Incoming EmaiI''

''Help! Waiting in the toilet
by the bath. Aiko.''

-Mononobe!
-Where are you?

I escaped from the lodge.

Did you bring the village map?

Yes.

They'll have shut all
the main roads down by now.

It's a little far but there's
an old tunnel on the east side.

Wait for me there.
I'm driving towards you now.

I understand.

By the way,
I have an important question.

How did you learn about
Ashikari village?

A friend of mine from school...
Her name's Aiko.

She invited me
to the hot springs here.

I've got to go help her.

How did she
learn about the village?

On the Internet, she said.

I doubt it.

According to my research,

there's nothing on the Internet
about Ashikari village.

Oh, no, then Aiko's...

She may be one of them.

Hello?

Listen, Shiyori.

You've got to get out alive.

If you want to survive,

don't trust anyone or anything.

Hello, hello!

Aiko.

Please...

Answer, Aiko.

Please.

Hello?

Hello, Aiko!
Thank god you're okay.

I was so worried.

Shiyori, what phone
are you calling from?

I'll tell you later!
Tell me, where are you?

In the toilet.

What? But I'm in the toilet.

You're in a different toilet.

Just watch out for the villagers.

This village is like sicko!

-Aiko...
-What?

You're not tricking me, are you?

What do you mean?

I can really trust you, right?

Answer me.

Why can't you answer! Aiko!

Listen, Shiyori. The truth is...

Hello, Aiko, Aiko!

What's wrong! Hello!

Aiko?

Hello?

Yayoi?

What, Shiyori?

Thank god, I got through!

You're my only friend.

Please, Yayoi, help me.

What's going on?

''Ashikari village''

''No Matching Documents''

That guy, Mononobe's story
does make sense.

But there's no proof that
you can trust him either.

And the cell phone you're using,

we don't even know
if there really is a Shizuka.

But...

In any case, I'll call the police.

And I'll check out
this guy Mononobe.

Thank you.

And I don't like saying this...

but...watch out for Aiko.

What's that supposed to mean?

She's just not my type.

Frankly, I don't trust her.

You're too trusting.

People take advantage of you.

But believe in yourself
and don't give up.

I wish I could go help you.

But I wouldn't be much help...

I'm sorry.

''I'll wait for you
at the East tunnel.''

''Message sent''

Give us your leg!

You're not tricking me, are you?

I can really trust you, right?

I'm going back to the room.

Hello, it's me.

Shiyori just left the baths.

Yeah, everything's on schedule.

''Chapter Two''

''The red cell phone,
in the toilet room''

Who's this?

What's going on?

''It's awful. Contact me now.
Shiyori''

''Help! Waiting in the toilet
by the bath. Aiko''

What's up with that person?

Found you.

You won't get away.

Finally, we're alone together.

Miss Hiuke Aiko.

Cute.

I wonder how many men
you've seduced?

May I have your name?

You remember Tezuka Yuta?

Cruel.

Cruel.

He was my boyfriend,
you stole him!

Can't keep track
of all the men you dumped?

Oh, maybe...

Remember?

I'm Tezuka Yuta's ex-girlfriend.

You swiped him from me...

and dumped him in no time.

You're Reika.

Hell.

Have you ever seen
the true face of hell!

-That's it?
-What?

You're really going
to kill me for that?

That's it?

Do you know how much I suffered?

Tezuka Yuta has gone now.

You killed him?

This is the middle of nowhere.

No matter who you kill,

they'll never find the bodies.

Crazy.

Snip, snip, snip...

What's that?

''Danger! Do not mix.''

What's this mess?

Where are you?
You're close, right?

A crazy girI's chasing me!
Please, help!

Watch out for Aiko.

Give us your leg.

Thank god, it still works.

''Chapter 3''

''Shiyori's cell phone,
in the dark.''

Hello?

Are you okay?

Yes.

I'll be there very soon.

Really?

Listen, Shiyori,

I'm on your side.

No matter what happens,
you have to believe that.

Mononobe!

Shiyori!

Asamiya?

Get in, quick!

Are you okay?

Why are you here?

From Yayoi.

Watch out.

there's no Mononobe
at Jonan University.

Maybe he's a villager.

''Caller: Mononobe Akira''

What's up?

Oh, nothing.

''Mononobe Akira''

Listen, Shiyori, I'm on your side.

Where are you?
You're close, right?

A crazy girI's chasing me!
Please, help!

Where's Shiyori?

We got split up.

Right. Hang in there.

What? Wait!

Oh, no!

Another toilet?

''Chapter Four''

''Aiko's cell phone, in the flame.''

Hello?

Hello, Aiko!
Thank god you're okay.

I was so worried.

Shiyori, what phone
are you calling from?

I'll tell you later!
Tell me, where are you?

In the toilet.

What? But I'm in the toilet.

You're in a different toilet.

You're not tricking me, are you?

What do you mean?

I can really trust you, right?

Answer me.

Why can't you answer! Aiko!

Listen, Shiyori. The truth is...

What's going on?

Hello, hello!

No!

I'm sorry, please forgive me!

Come on!

I'm pissed.

You're going to pay for this.

Get ready.

I won't fall for that twice!

''Highly Flammable''

I won't do that twice!

''I'll wait for you
at the East tunnel. Shiyori.''

Snip, snip, snip...

Snip, snip...

Get in, quick!

''Shiyori''

''The Final Chapter''

''Two Cell phones, in X-Cross.''

''Caller: Mononobe Akira''

Please listen to me, Shiyori.

The person who engineered
our breakup,

was actually Aiko.

This girl at work
had a crush on me.

She got Aiko to seduce me,

so that you and I would break up.

And I totally fell for it.

So, that time,

you were kissing...

Shiyori!

Aiko.

But...

I really wanted
another chance with you.

So I asked Aiko
to set up this trip.

So the person
who chose this village...

should be...

Yeah, Aiko.

I had to apologize
to you in person.

I'm sorry.

I'm really in love with you...

Hey...

Hello?

I'm in Asamiya's car.

Oh, that's good.

He told me everything.

About what you did, too.

After all,

I was just a ''sort of' friend.

I always trusted you.

I always believed
you were my friend.

Shiyori...

You were always laughing
behind my back!

Thinking I was an idiot
for getting depressed.

That's what you really thought.

No!

Stop making a fool out of me!

You knew all about...

this village's secret.

What do you mean?

Don't act dumb.

Murderer.

I'll protect you, Shiyori.

Forever and ever.

Hello?

Aiko, listen, this is important!

''Caller: Mononobe''

Hello?

Are you okay?

I couldn't reach you for a while.

Mononobe,

ho exactly are you?

My friend looked you up.

Your name's not listed at Jonan.

Oh, that's all.

But you said you go to Jonan.

I'm an instructor there.

Did she check out
the professors, too?

But...

''Welcome to Ashikari village''

Hey, Asamiya, that's...

Listen, Shiyori,
I have new information.

I found out who took
my sister to that village.

His name is Asamiya Keiichi.

He's from that village.

Hey, what happened? Shiyori!

What happened!

Shiyori! Shiyori!

Please, help Shiyori!

If you're really her friend.

That's...impossible...

There's no way, no way!

You tricked me, Aiko.

I'll tell Shiyori.

No, you can't.

Then, listen to me.

Invite Shiyori...

to the hot springs.

Hot springs?

I want to start over with her.

I know a sweet spot.

It's Ashikari hot springs.
Amazingly secluded.

You're not tricking me, are you?

I can really trust you, right?

Lucky Shiyori...

It is time to commence...

the ritual of...

the living sacrifice!

Wait!

Asamiya!

You're Asamiya, right!

Welcome to Ashikari village.

But why!?

See the village I was born into?

I was looking for you.

Someone to be with me forever.

Someone who would live
with me here.

I finally found you.

I fixed this up to live in Tokyo.

But I don't need it.

It hurts...

It hurts...

What perfect fine legs!

Stop!

Stop it!

I'll never let you go.

Stop.

Stop!

Get away!

Stop!

My own living sacrifice!

My very own living sacrifice!

I got you!

I love you.

Not so fast!

Aiko!

Shiyori!

Did you get the picture I sent?

Okay.

Yayoi!

Let Shiyori go!

Otherwise, I'll send these
pictures all over the country!

I'll destroy your little village!

I'm serious, we'll wipe it out!

Why? Why'd you come to save me?

Wait, this is hardly the time...

Just answer me!

Answer me!

Because... I hadn't told you,

how I truly feel.

You're not a ''sort of' friend.

To me, you're not!

Catch them!

Aiko!

No way, Reika!

Who are you?

Outta the way!

Aiko!

Aiko!

Shiyori, I'm late!

Mononobe?

Quick, get in!

Okay.

My living sacrifice!

I won't let you go!

Aiko!

Let go!

Shiyori.

Hiuke Aiko!

Aiko!

Quick, Shiyori!

Follow them!

You can't escape!

Quickly!

Hurry!

My living sacrifice!

Let's live together!

Live with me!

Let go!

I love you!

Are you both all right?

Yes.

Thank God I made it in time.

Who's he?

Mononobe.

He stayed up all night,
encouraging me on the phone.

I get it.

What?

Mononobe!
Do you have a girlfriend?

Aiko!

Who, me? I'm totally available.

It's dawn.

It was a long night.

It really was.

''Ashikari Hot Spring
is just a fiction.''

''It is not related to
any real village and place.''
