KI Joo-bong, KIM Myoung-gook

Damn it!

He's probably faster
than Carl Lewis

He's definitely faster
than Carl Lewis

I'm a Korean detective

I always chase them

But there's nowhere for them to hide

No matter how fast they run,
they can't run away

Our country is surrounded by the sea

There's a huge army in Norhh Korea

There's nowhere to hide

WlLD CARD

Hey! Jay-soo!
Yes?

What are you doing tonight?

Hey, I know you're lying.
How about a drink tonight?

Really?

Hey Cheol-gu!
How about a drink?

We're starhing the Victoria

Young-man, what about you?

I'm going with him

Aren't you going home?

Myung-hwan, how about a drink?

It's my wedding anniversary

Really?
Yes

Bastards

Mother's birhhday and
a wedding anniversary?

Bastards

It's no use being nice
to those assholes

I should've worked them to the bone

Director KlM Yoo-jin

What about Ki-bok?
No, sir

Ki-choon?
Sorry, Mr. OH

Eleven of us are going in,
including Myung and Gahp

Are you making a soccer team?
You're not in charge now

I forced the youngsters to do it.
Forgive them

You forgot the magic word,
"Please"

Lieutenant! I'm going home

Where are you going?

I'm backing up Team 1 today

I see

Young-dahl, are you ready?
Go ahead

Hurry up

Jay, lock them up
Yes

Are you going somewhere too?

What's wrong with you?

A new investigation starhs today

I understand

I've got a little time
for just one drink

Just forget it

Hey, c'mon

Hey!

This one looks expensive

It's just a restaurant.
Let's go in

Why is it so dark?
Turn on the lights

Happy birhhday!

They are lovely

It's so nice to get flowers

I owe your wife.
Say thanks to her

Don't mention it.
They are all over my house

What is this?

Open it. You'll like it

Bremen...
They're Bremens

Made in Germany.
Swedish Raybeks were the best,

but now Bremens are better

Criminals like them because
they're light and comforhable

Right.
These old ones were too heavy

Why can't we make them like these?

They're just for criminals anyway

Ours are nice, too.
They are just heavy and loose

Remember Snakehead?
Yeah

One day I was writing a reporh
He says "Lieutenant" and

he looks at me and his wrists

And I noticed that
the cuffs were loose

I said, "What the hell"
and he put them back on himself

I searched the entire market for them

Whose idea was it?
Jay-soo's

Thanks boy

Lieutenant, why don't you try them on?

Okay

They're very light

I can't feel any weight

A toast for the lieutenant

For Lieutenant Biannual!
Cheers!

What is it?

I left it in the office

Don't be kidding

I'm not kidding

Hurry and go get it
before you drive him mad

Ok! Ok! Bastards

Everything is on me tonight.
The drinks, the karaoke, everything

Satisfied?

When you truly love someone

a million roses will bloom

Without hatred, just love freely

They buried him with a shovel

When's he going to stop?

I am sick of this song

When he sings it a million times

then the farmer ran for office!

A long life to you!

Who are they?

Looks like a new gang
Those rats...

Detective OH!

8 months ago, on March 5th at 2 am,

you shot twice at
the drug dealer suspect Hong

He accused you of using
excessive force. You know that, right?

Use of Force Rule clause 1,
The first shot must be a blank

Clause 2, you must warn them
to give up at least 3 times

If you shoot, you must shoot
the lower parh of the body

Did you follow the regulations?

How can I tell someone
in a car to give up

and shoot the legs?

He was only 10 meters
away from you

10 meters or 100 meters,
What's so imporhant about it?

It's imporhant

He was only 10 meters away from you.
How could you shoot him in the back?

We had to catch him

That's a use of excessive force

Stop the bull shit!

He would sell drugs
even in a wheelchair

You were suspended for a month

in 1995 for the same reason

It was 25 days

That's it for today

Do you know that Korean Police work
more than 168 hours a month?

Quit if you are tired

We work 15 nights a month,
but they only pay for 75 hours

Quit if you don't like it

For the last five years, out of
all government employees,

police officers were most likely
to die on duty

Quit before you die

You memorized all that?

Of course
Why?

It makes me look cool

Excuse me. I'm doing random checks.
Your lD please?

KANG Nana 760624-2235013

58-2 Sinsa-dong Kangnam Seoul

Thank you for your cooperation

Find anything?

Looks like they killed her for money

What's that?
It's the CCCV tape

Did you contact her family?

Not yet

Then how are we going to
do the autopsy?

Who's going?

Chil-sun, stop by tomorrow morning

Um, l...

Is there a problem?

I'll go

Good

What are we going to tell them?

I feel like a confessing criminal

I have several things to ask you

Did you get any strange calls?

Any visitors?

No

I feel very...

Fucking killers...

She had a blow on the head.
No cuts or incisive wounds

The wound isn't sharp,

and the weapon could've been
a blunt metal object or bat

Right now, this tape is all we have

We can't tell anything except
that there were four of them

HAN Tae-jung, age 40,
a money exchanger in the black market

Her husband died 4 years ago.
She lived with her mother and two children.

had about 2 million Won
and 2,000 US Dollars with her

It doesn't seem like
any kind of revenge

I see

Then, there's a high possibility
that it was just for the money

Criminal Team 3 take this case.
You had the best results last year

during the intensive enforcement period

That's it

Which do you hate most?
Rape or murder?

Murder

Me too.
Imagine yourself as a victim

Dying of no reason
all of a sudden

Fucking lunatics

At least robbers tell you to freeze.
These lunatics just kill

If someone strikes the back
of your head and runs away,

which way will he run?
The palace, City Hall,

the Arch or downtown?

Myung-hwan, tell me
Yeah?

City Hall
Downtown Downtown

But, how can you know?

Who knows where he'll go?

I wonder if the arrest rate is real

Cut it out

We don't need to spoil
the beer before we open it

What's going on?
Put that out!

Jay-soo, give me the names of
the subway stations in Seoul

Apgujung, Sinsa, Jamwon,
Cheongdam, Nonhyun, Hakdong...

Bus stops
Yeah?

Can you count them all?

You can't!

What are you going to do?

Young-dahl!

Arrest all the gangs in the area
and torhure them until

we get something
Correct!

Patrol and patrol, work and work
and arrest anyone suspicious!

Reporh to me at 5 am.
Every morning

Chli-sun, what does that mean?

It means we can't go home

Over

You look awesome!

Mr. OH I work hard now

Hard?

You seem to be making easy money

Where's Sang-taek?

I haven't seen him for a while

You, you and you.
The three of you!

Be at the office with Sang-taek by 2

I really don't know, detective OH

Do you think I do?

2 o'clock. Ok?
Yes, sir

You're pathetic

Cover up!

What's wrong with your hand?

Got hurh
When?

A few days ago
Where?

At a nightclub, sir
How?

Opening a beer

Not opening someone's
head with that beer?

What? I'm a lefty.
This is my right hand

Horsenose and Hoon were there too

You can ask them

Then come to the office with
Horsenose and Hoon by 2 tomorrow

Yes, sir

Lie down

Myong-hwan!

What's up?

Got anything new?
Not yet

What about Chil-sun?

You ask me

Let's go. Catch you later

Take care

I like you and you know that, right?
Thanks

But sometimes you drive me nuts

What was Chil doing last month
during the intensive enforcement period

when we were risking our lives?

He arrested teenagers
fighting around schools

and tricked them into handcuffs
with pizzas

Only 16 or 17 years old!

I am not a teacher or a minister,
but it ain't right

You should talk to him!

Why do you always shut up
when it's about Chil!

Jay-soo...

I like you too

What brings you here detective

Don't worry

Take care, detective

That's mine

Treat others' things like yours,
you asshole!

How much do you get for these?

I pick them for 10,000 and
pass them on for 30,000

30,000? You said 15,000!

I knew you were cheating
Behave, you shitheads

Hurry and get in 1,2,3

Can't you get a bigger car?

From 8pm 23rd to 4am 24th

Write down everything
you did In detail

Where you ate and
when you shit. Everything!

If you fool around, you know
what'll happen. Do it now!

What are you looking at, asshole?

Sit straight! Where do you live?

Chamsil, sir

What does your father do?

Owns a gas station

Then you must be well off

Why the hell is a rich kid
doing such a thing!

What's his phone number?

His phone's not working
Not working?

Don't you dare give me bullshit!
Can I talk for a second?

Why? I'm busy

Look after him
Yes, sir

Is this your home?

What are you doing with a kid when
we are fucking after a murder case?

He had a knife.
You know that kind of kids

He was prying coins from
videogames They're on my desk

I used to have that kind of knife
at school, too

You can let him go with a warning

You don't know what you're saying

Those bastards turn into pickpockets,
robbers and killers

You got to nip out the bud

Not nurhuring it?

What do you mean?
So you will send him to prison?

Perhaps you can recommend
a lawyer to his parents

You son of a bitch!
Don't talk to me like that

Right. I want the kickback
from the lawyer

Jay-soo, go in

I'm not working with that dirty cop

Son of a bitch

Do I have to work with disrespect?

Calm down.
What's wrong with you two?

You mean I'm wrong?

This is an emergency.
Jay-soo wasn't totally wrong

Hey!
Do you have a light?

There was a murder in the jurisdiction

This is a house of death

Who fights in a mourner's house?

After washing all the socks...

of those senior detectives,
and it's not turning out like

you thought it would?

Don't act like kids
after 10 years of experience

stubborn fools

Sook, where's my underwear?

Right corner of the bottom drawer

He's not the detective type

Why not?

What kind of a detective changes
his underwear everyday?

Right. Some don't change it
until the case is solved

Of course.
That's how it should be

The inspectors came by
They were very inquisitive

They even had the cerhification of
your family's land

So what did you tell them?

I almost said that
you're running to be buried,

not to get money

Just quit that job

Detectives who can't shoot.
What good are they?

Quit and water flowers?

Or you can run a karaoke

and sing A Million Roses
over and over

Enough. Let's go

Good night

The phone's ringing

Flower shop!

I'll burn your fucking roses bitch!

I'll shave your head and
shove it down the fucking drain

Your husband ruined me by
sending me to that fucking prison!

Where's your fucking husband?

Who told you to hang up bitch!
Do that again

and I'll fry you,
your husband and your baby!

You still don't get me bitch?

Why don't you call up his mobile?

It's 016-285-1605

You fucking

Son of a bitch

Why didn't you hit him, damn it!

A car was passing
Why did you hesitate?

They could've seen me
You should've hit him earlier

Damn it!
Stupid fucking loser

Fucking moron
Motherfucker!

You asshole!

Fucking hell!

Damn it, you think you can

Drive in hell forever, motherfucker!

She's something

You like her?

Motherfucker! Get off me!

Let me go

Get off me! You assholes!

Help him

What's that?
Hold on

We'll send you to paradise

Stop it!

I'll do it! Stop!

Get that thing off me. Do it

Now you're talking

Motherfuckers! Go ahead

You motherfuckers!

Say something!

I was raped on a main street!

Not one but by four, damn it

The patrol car drove right by!
Are you cops blind?

I wouldn't have come here if
I was raped in a back street!

I won't put up with this

I'll sue the Korean government

And reporh this to the
Women's Association!

Bargirls can be raped on the street?

Who is in charge!
Where's the chief?

Please calm down

Are you the chief?
I'm a lieutenant

I don't want any lieutenants!
Where's the fucking chief?

Did they threaten you with a knife?

No

Any weapons?

Oh, they put a metal ball in my back
and almost crushed me

Let me see

I don't know

They all look the same.
It's damn confusing

Have a good look.
Only eyes are left now

What does the lD Team say?

It could be a metal ball given
the shape of the wound

Really?
Yes

Please take a closer look

She has such a temper

Biannual had a very hard time
Yeah, right

Who gave him that nickname?

Do you know?

His wife, when she was pissed off

Why?

He used to be number 1 in arrest rate

He'd catch one on his way to work
and two on the way back

Guess how many days he went home?
He lived in the office

Ah! He went home biannually

Use your brain!
He does her biannually

There must be a million in that bag

Look at that expensive watch.
He must be going to the dawn market

Oh my! Fucking old hobo

Let's go

Murders and thefts have occurred

in the downtown area

Yesterday at 5 am, a man in 70's

was found dead with
a wound in the head

The police are looking for witnesses,

and yet are investigating
the area for clues

Fuck! Fuck!
What?

This old man

If we had walked out from
that store 5 minutes later,

he wouldn't have died.
Damn it!

Where are you going?

Thieves will catch thieves

Come out, Teddy Bear!

Come on out, Teddy Bear!

Aren't you gonna come out,
Teddy Bear?

Gosh! It's being torn!

Hurry up. Teddy Bear

My brother's ruining your tables!

You have good cards

I'll kill the Bulldozer...

Forgive me for not stopping by
for a while

Hey, the fabric's too soft

Hi, Teddy Bear
How are you, sir?

You look good

A small world is better
than the big cell, isn't it?

Of course, sir

Where's Sang-chun?
Sang-chun?

I haven't seen him
Really?

I heard you live off of dirty money

It's all I can do to feed myself, sir

Who gave you the money for
the gambling house

Fucking Sang-chun did, bastard
Where is he?

I don't know
Really?

You don't know?

I can find out through other sources

After wiping out this
place with the bulldozer?

Should l?

I will if you want

He'll kill me if he finds out

Who's Sang-chun?

You know the Elegance Gang party?

Hairhail, Flatfish, and that
bar owner Sausage?

He's their boss
Fucker of the fuckers

A king fucker

Sang-chun! Where are you?

Who is Sang-chun?
Your boss

There's no one here by that name

Excuse me, sir!

What's Sang-chun doing?

Sang-chun, where are you?
Shut the door!

What's Sang-chun doing?

Boss, look!

Oh dear

How can 2 devils appear
in this decent place at once!

I'll take care of them

No, they're not the corrupt kind

Don't make us go crazy

Where is he?

Who the fuck are you?
Who's talking so loud?

You look like a weasel,

Shut up you motherfucker!
You asshole!

Left turn, gentlemen

Hanna! Bring us the
sweet turhle blood

OK Ok OK

This is how I live

Anyway, what brings you here sir?

From now on, don't talk or ask

Why not, sir?

It's very disturbing.
Just answer my questions

You know that there'd been
two serial murders, right?

You can speak when I ask

I didn't know.
When did that happen?

I've no idea who they are
but they must be

Stop!

You are a legend among muggers.
You are a king to them

It doesn't make sense that
the king doesn't know anything

Gather your boys by tomorrow

I can't.
They'll starve to death!

You can't?

Giant Hotel lobby, restaurant row

Holy Nightclub.
Your muggers did all those

Excuse me, sir!
What are you saying?

They're not muggers. They just
took wallets from some drunks

They're just pickpockets

Why bring that up all of a sudden?

Those happened ages ago

There are tons of crimes to lock
you up. Want me to count'em?

That's enough

Call everyone. Hairhail, Flatfish,
Teddy Bear and Sausage

Everyone. No exceptions!

Sure, I get you

Enjoy the drinks
