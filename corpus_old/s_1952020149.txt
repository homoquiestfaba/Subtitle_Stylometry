God.

How long have I been out?

About an hour.

Where are we?

ROB:
We just crossed the state line.

Really?
Mm-hm.

Already?

Mm. Why do I smell food?

ROB: There should be a girlie toy
in there for you.

SHELBY: Thanks, sweetie.
Yeah.

Jesus, Rob, slow down.
You're driving over a hundred.

I've got a really good convoy going here.
No.

Just slow down. Now.

Thank you.

Look...

...okay, I know we had a shitty weekend.

I wanna get home too.
But let's just do it safely, okay?

No more bad luck.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

Oh, I got the spot.

"I love you too, Shelby."

I love you too.

I do.

I'm wide awake so get some sleep.

Okay. Thank you, sweetie.
ROB: Mm-hm.

[TRUCK HORN BLARING]

Ah. Bingo.

Hey, you knocked out another hour.
Ugh.

I only feel more tired.

Are you tired yet?

Nope.

I cannot believe you started another one.

I didn't.

This one found me.
Oh, whatever.

Look at the speedometer.
It's like 12 miles over the speed limit.

The other one, you were right.
It was too fast and unsafe.

This one isn't.
Oh, please.

Seriously, there's like an art
to a good convoy, babe.

It's like a conversation between us
and the cars as we drive. We communicate.

No, did you see that? That's him warning
me that there's some slow cars up ahead...

...so we're gonna have to pass them.

Oh, that's pretty considerate.

Oh, see, now this is what I like to call
a brake pumper.

You think speeding's dangerous,
try driving behind this guy.

Okay.

At this speed, I'm fine with it.
Just don't go faster.

ROB:
Oh, right on.

I was wondering
when they were gonna need to fuel up next.

Well, what do we do?

Are we supposed to introduce ourselves,
say hi?

I don't know.

I mean, I've never actually met anyone
I've been in a convoy with.

Ha, ha, ha. Yeah.

No, I'm just messing with you. Anyway,
uh, I was talking to this trucker inside.

Not very chatty guy.

Anyway, he said he got on
his, uh, radio-thingy.

Said the interstate up ahead's
pretty wall-to-wall.

ROB: Mm. Really?
Hey?

Trucker on my CB says
it ain't moving worth a damn out there.

Told me a way around it, though, so...

...you're more than welcome
to swing on in behind me.

Come on. I could use the company.

Road's a Ionely place
when you're traveling solo.

Yeah, you got it, man. Hey, thanks.

No problem.

[SIGN BUZZING]

[TRUCK BEEPING]

What'd you talk about?

Oh, the interstate's jammed up ahead
so we're gonna go around.

Yeah, and Mr. Lonesome up front there...
SHELBY: Uh, he's not alone.

Yeah, he is. That's what he said.

Rob, he's not alone.
There's a girl with him. I saw her.

Misunderstanding then.

It's no big deal.

You sure we should be doing this?

Would you rather turn around
and crawl up the interstate?

It's like a parking lot.

SHELBY:
No.

Guess we're fine.

Great.

It's the sticks, Shelby.

People hunt out in the sticks.

There, see? Did you see that?

What?
In the window. Get closer.

There is someone in there.

[WOMAN SCREAMS]


SHELBY:
Hello? Hello?

Can you hear me?
What the hell?

You get his plates.
You get his license plates.

Shelby, come on.
No, just go! Get his plates now! Go!

but he took off. You'll be fine.

No, I jumped.

What happened?

He... He...

He came back.

You're drunk, Miss Swan.

And you're celibate. Take off

No.

It's Roommate Night.

Besides, he just moved into town
and he's staying at the Pere's Pension.

That dump by the park?
Yeah. But it's temporary.

Be nice.
