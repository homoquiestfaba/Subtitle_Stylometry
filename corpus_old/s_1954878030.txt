effort to expand future prospects regarding arms
roles to Poland and Hungary

And in local news, the weekend was relatively quiet
as rival gangs continue to honor their truce

City officials and community leaders
are encouraged by this sign

As the long wake of violence that has
besieged this city may be coming to an end

A spokesperson for the Police Dept, said
they are taking a wait and see attitude

Nah  -- Come on, man, Don't be a pussy
--- I just don't want it.

Don't tell me you're trying to quit

Shut up!

Check this holmes,

I don't buy this truce shit with the Blades

IDK what Cisco is thinking arranging this
meeting with that fucken mayugo, Willie

But I don't want to get my ass shot up
because you don't know what the fuck to do when

You stay here, and give us five minutes
and then you come and pick us up, comprende

Simon

Hey, say like you have got some huevos,
Faggot ass puto

I understand, Jesus

Are you Jesus?

Who the fuck are you, puto?

Where's Willie?
-- Willie couldn't make it.

He wanted me to meet with you instead

Shit, I knew Willie ain't got no fucken huevos

He's got this white-ass mutherfucker working for him

So if you're his message boy,
What's his fucken message, boy?

Willie thinks that the fighting between the Lords
and the Blades is a contributing factor

to the breakdown of the moral fiber
in this neighborhood

All he is saying is

Give peace a chance

Who the fuck are you?
-- Get down you fucker, right now

Let the overture begin

Let's do this pendejo

The perfect end to a glorious day

This will end all talk of a gang truce
and keep our friends in the Dept busy

We lost 'im

You'll find him

Lt, looks like a gang massacre

I thought you said there was a truce

Truce my ass. Its blacks vs latinos

It's the same old shit, it ain't never gonna end.

Well, it's about time that it does end
-- What can you do?

What do you mean, you?

WE are gonna shake down every
gang member in this neighborhood

I don't want a fucken war breaking out,
Do you understand?

We throw a net around the whole area

And you will make sure there
is no retaliations

Look, it ain't gonna help, Lt.
It's a waste of time.

I grew up in these nighborhoods

One day at a time, Fernandez, huh?
One day at a time.

Lucinda, you're early.
Lunch isn't for another hour

Early for what, I hadn't noticed
-- You know you're a lousy poker player

Let's see what we got here:

baked chicken, corn bread, AND apple pie

Now I now I'm in trouble,
what's on your mind Lucinda?

A friend of mine is in trouble.

Her name's Rebeca Sanchz.
I thought maybe you could help her.

What kind of trouble are we talking about here?
-- Car trouble

The only reason why she didn't come here herself
is she's working and her car ain't

I told her I would ask you if would meet with her

and here is her name and number.
You call her now.

Eat your lunch

Tell me -- There's nothing. No word on the street,
the kid split, he's gone

We know he hasn't gone to the police
-- Yet

I don't want anything to interfere with our plan.

I want a name, I want an address.
And I want the war to begin.

I promise if you're really good, I'll ???
-- Thank you  Here we go, -- Okay

Beca Sanchez?

Yeah, you Barett?

Well, you have some information for me or not?

I won't know what to tell you until I take a look at it.
You have it parked around here somewhere?

Do I have what parked around here?
-- Your car.

I don't even own a car

What kind of information are you looking for?

About my brother being missing

IDK what you're talking about. Lucinda told me
you were having trouble with your car

I callled Lucinda this morning and she told me that
she knew an ex-cop who might be able to help

Nww I know why I got the apple pie.

Look, IDK anything about your brother and
I don't do police work anymore.

I'm sorry
-- No, that's fine

because to tell you the truth I don't
expect much from anyone anyway

fine, well, in that case
I wish you good luck

Hey, Barett, I'll let
you in on a little secret

the police don't do
police work anymore either

shhh, shhh, calmate,  calmate!

estas con familia
-- Who are you? What do you want?

Carlos, Where is he?

I sent him out to do something,
and he never came back -- He's just a kid

What did you get him into?

When he comes back,
you tell him to find me

You leave him alone. He doesn't
want to be part of the Lords

Too late.

Suentenla
[ Let her go ]

Barett, are you okay? Seal off the area

Keep everybody back

Hey, Jake, what about those Dodgers, six in a row..

Yeah, maybe this our year, huh?

Don't move, Don't move I said
or I'll blow you head off

Tu dame el dinero, pronto!
[ Give me the money, quick ]

I'll blow your head off!

You, dude, cargeme el dinero

Apurate
[ Hurry up ]

Andale
[ Go on ]

Damelo todo, damelo
[ I want all of it ]

Damelo todo -- esta bien, todo

Now!

Emilio, How can you charge so much for this stuff?
-- Get down, fuck-head

What're you getting so upset about?
There more orange juice back here

Hey, it's okay, it's okay, easy

You okay?
-- Just a little shook up

Gracias
 [ Thank you ]

Que huvo, Barett -- What's the problem, Cisco
I want to talk to you about what went down last night

Emilio is mi tio, he's my uncle

you did a good job, ese --
Yeah, well, Emilio thanked me last night

I don't want nothing from you man. Besides, I don't believe in freebies.

You saved my Uncle's ass. I'm saying thanks. That's it.

ahh, arrgh,, oww

Paso, Good Morning, ese. You got a friend
who drove a black Ford the other night?

ay, man, IDK nothing about nothing
-- You know what I say you know

And I say you got a friend who drove a black Ford

I asked you a question
-- And I told you, IDK anything, ese

Enough!  Leave Pee-Wee alone

Give me a name, and I'll stop all this.
Otherwise..

I'm gonna let you go. Give a chance to heal,
grab you, and bust you up again.

Let you go, give you a chance to heal,
grab you and bust you up again

If you don't..

Carlos Sanchez!
-- That wasn't so hard, was it?

Now I want an address.  --

the address..

Fuck you!

Hi -- Mr Barrett, I've got no one else,
I need you to help me find my brother

I told you I don't do that kind of work anymore
-- Lucinda tells me that the past two years

you've been helping her and her kids.
Mr Barett, I'm scared

I need you, I've got no one else to turn to

alright, how old is he?
-- Fifteen

How long's he been missing?
-- Two days  - Two days?

well, maybe he's with his girlfriend,
or out with his friends somewhere

Not Carlos, he wouldn't just leave
me without telling me

Even his own gang can't find him
-- He's with a gang?

Yes
-- I'm sorry, I can't help you

Oh, you're some hero, aren't you.
A regular knight in shining armor.

No.  I never was.
You'll have to excuse me now.

You got a problem, Fernandez.
I told you no retaliation.

Make the net tighter. I don't want a goddamn cockroach
to get through. Do you understand, huh?

What's up, 8-Ball?
-- this don't make no sense, dawg.

Well, it makes sense to me.  Motherfucken Lords
have been chewing us up and spitting us out, man.

Word is we been taking the heat for them Lords, man

One time they picked us out
cause the man ain't got no proof

Well, I say we take Cisco and the rest of
them bean-eating Mexicans and pop a cap in they ass

Better chill
-- just fuck taking it chill, Eight

them motherfucken Lords been moving in on
all our business G, and we gotta blast them

Fuck that, man. We're moving now

yo, Willie

Don't you ever tell me what I gots to do.
You got that motherfucker?

Van a pagar, Pee Wee

Look at what they did to our homie, man

Look at him.  Since you started dealing
with that leva 8-Ball

Our homeboys, been getting smoked

Fuck the dumbshit

I say we hit them now

You know what ese, we gotta do them up

Take out those pinche mayates, before
the pigs take over our streets

Alright, we run deep

We get the rest of the homies

Do it now

Rebeca

Look about that stuff that happened
last night at the garage

I'm just glad you called

I can't make any promises, but,
come on let's talk

So where're your folks?

They died when Carlos was five, I was eighteen,
so I brought him up

We're all each other has

You always lived in this neighrbood?
Yes, What about you?

Yeah, all my life

That ballfield over there, my Dad used
to take me there every Sunday

A lot of this have changed since then

Well, in this neighborhood, if you were
a boy and wanted to survive

you joined a gang

Carlos used to be beaten up by gangbangers
every day, coming and going to school

They wanted him to join, kept calling him a coward

Becoming a member was the only way he could remain in school

He's in the Westside Latin Lords, isn't he?

Yes
-- Is Carlos still in school now?

Up till this happened he never even
missed a day of homework

He's a great student. Math, Science
He wants to be an astronomer

It's all he ever talks about, as though life here is
so lousy, He wishes he lived on another planet

Yeah, I know how he feels

Barett,

I need to know. Do you think you could help me?

Let me see what I can find out,
Did you bring that picture of Carlos

Yeah

Ok

You wanted to see me?
-- Carlos Sanchez, I need to find him

Same here, ese. You're asking for his sister, que no?

She's being looked after

If she prays, I hear about it before god does

What's with all the soldiers?

Three months ago, 8-Ball and I
came together to end the war

Two days ago, I sent four of my homies to talk business

and now they're dead.  That same night,
Carlos was there. And now that chavala is missing.

This morning we find Pee-Wee, with fifteen caps up his face

8-Ball wants war, I can have seventy-five hundred
soldiers in one hour

The clicks will roll, Barett. The word will get out.
And this hood will be full of homies in no time.

Do you understand, Barett.  And the lives of everybody
in this hood will never be the same.

This city will burn.

Is that what you want, Cisco?

It's what they want, homes

What're you gonna do if you find out Carlos ran?
-- That's not your problem ese

And so, in conclusion, forensics
began as an inexact science.

But has since, used the cutting edge
of bio-medical technology

to provide for the policeman in the field
the greatest amount of information

with the least amount of evidence

So forensics truly is the best thing to being there

Lady, gentlemen, I thank you,  good day

and so, in conclusion, forensics began

Jake,
-- Hi, Ray -- How you doing?

Good to see you again, man
-- You too, my friend

How you feeling? -- Well, truthfully,
Jake, I'm tired and I'm bored

How are you? -- I'm good, you know
Don't you miss active duty, just a little bit?

Well, I don't think about it much
-- So, Why you here?

I need to see a police report. The one on that
gang shooting the other night. Seventh Street alley.

You know, if I didn't know better, I would think
you're conducting an informal investigation

Let's see what the machine tells us, let's check it out here.

Here we go, we have one dead black youth,
four dead hispanic youths

ballistics match on the one of the hispanic's
youth guns as the gun which killed the black youth

shell casings all over the ground.
Just another hot day in L.A.

Now this is odd. According to the report,
one group of shell casings had oil deposits

from where fingers touched them,
Did they run a make on the prints?

well, that's just it, there was oil,
but no fingerprints

I don't get it, Did anybody investigate this?
-- Well, apparently not

Whose signature is on the report?
-- It says here Lt Bill Crowe

You don't think the Dept is involved, do you?
-- I don't know

See what else you can find out for me, if you would,
Hopefully we won't find out any John Does

in the morgue that fits this kid's description

Give me a call later on, will you? -- Ok, will do
And thanks  -- You got it, Jake

This is going to be an interesting evening

Yo, Barett.  Fuck you doing with
them motherfucken Lords, man?

You got five to tell me what's up

Come on, motherfucker, come on.
I'mma cut you bitch

No, noo, nah, man. Don't you even think about it

You 8-Ball?
--  Right

You Barett, huh? One that runs with the kiddies in the hood

Your set put a hit on me. Why?
-- Been hanging with the them Lords, man

An ex-cop ought to know enough to stay out of the gang business
-- Not interested in your gang business

Cisco is ready to go to war. Cause the other
night you called a meeting, and four of his are gone

Now, what's up?

I ain't done nothing

I lost one last night, and another one
this morning. So all meetings are over

Somethings not right here. They lost
four and you lost two.

Nobody wants to be responsible.  It's gonna
take some time to figure this one out.

Time..  time is something that we ain'ts gots

Heat's on, and we getting burnt
-- Look, you give me two days

I think I can get the same thing from Cisco  -- I thinks not

You wanted a truce!  Nobody benefits from war, 8-Ball

I'll see what's up

How I look ese, ah? Que paso

Ya lookin good mun

Move fast, we're just taking the automatics

My, my, my. Who do we have here?
-- Alright, let's make it quick

Come on, let's load 'em those up

Franklin, we got two birds perching
-- Copy

Ese man, don't mess with the Westside Latin Lords  -- What?

Hey, fool, what's your problem man.
Get off of me, man

You don't know who you fucking with. My brother Willie's
gonna put a cap all over somebody's ass.

That's I'm counting on

Who's this?
-- Willie, por favor

What?
-- Ahorita matamos a tu hermano [ We killed your brother ]

Lo hubiera oir gritar,  Hey Willie, ese,
We just did your brother, ese

You should've hear him scream,,
Pendejo, aay,, Just like a woman

Why did you leave the force, Barrett?
-- That shop I've got used to belong to my Dad

Fixing cars with him, was one
of the best times of my life

You didn't leave the force to fix cars

About three years ago, there was a situation

Some psycho took an eight-year old hostage

When I put my gun down, the son-of-a-bitch killed her

So when I got out of the hospital,
I left the force and came home

All of my life, I've lived scared in these
streets, scared for myself, scared for Carlos.

It's no way to live

And then the President added, with economic
indicators on the rise

even though there were some difficulties ahead,
the country's prognosis is a healthy one

In local news, it looks like the
gang truce is definitely over

Two men were killed last night when a gun
warehouse was robbed in Downtown Los Angeles

One of the men found dead at the scene,
belonged to the South Central Blades gang

And according to witnesses, the robbery and murders
were committed by members of the rival gang, the Westside Latin Lords

And in city hall today, Councilwoman Lana Lee
proposed restrictive anti-smoking

This is your idea of a truce?

I told you those goddamn mayugos can't be trusted

You're not gonna be happy till you have a fucken war, are ya?

What're you talking about, they just blasted us, Barett!

You hit a wharehouse last night, and you killed a Blade

Why?
-- What're you talking about?

I gave you two days, I haven't touched
those goddamn chanates!

There were witnesses describing..

For the last time, puto. I put this on my mother.
IDK what the fuck you're talking about

But as soon as those pigs go back to Winchell's, it's on

Fuckers are having to learn to respect me, man

A gun doesn't get you respect, Willie.
-- Don't front on me man. Them motherfuckers killed my brother

And they fixing to pay, now
-- The Lords didn't kill your brother

You can't stop me, man.  Eight-ball can't stop me.
The man can't stop me.

How're you gonna stop me? -- Listen to me,
you're gonna start a war for no reason

Somebody's messing with you and the Lords.
Somebody else killed your brother, Willie

Now, I need a meeting with 8-Ball,
and I need it now.  It's up to you.

Give me a reason to respect you, man

The truck'll be ready tonight?
-- A couple of hoses, new shocks, she'll be ready

We still had no luck finding Sanchez.
But I have feelers out everywhere.

I want double shifts on the streets. And I want
pay-offs made at all the schools and hangouts.

I want every rock turned over, and every door kicked in.
I want Carlos Sanchez.

We still have a problem. -- A problem?
-- A guy named Barrett

Willie was supposed to take out Cisco, but,
Barett stepped in and stopped it

Word is, this guy Barett is an ex-cop

Jake Barrett ?
-- Right  -- You know him

I know of him. Graduated Stanford, the top of his class.
He's a highly decorated cop

He even got the Mayor's Commendation award the same year I did.
But now, he's dysfunctional

kid was killed in an incident,
he felt guilty. He quit the force

Now he's wasting his life,
doing penance for kids on the streets

But he's part of the equation I didn't count on

Make it look like a gang hit

Hello -- Hi, it's me. I was
thinking about what you asked for

Something about Carlos and IDK
if this means anything but

something Carlos always used to
say to me was, "Esta en paz"

He found peace with the stars.
He was always looking to the heavens

We'll find him, Rebecca. -- I, I just wish
there was something more I could do

I'll call you back later, okay?

Yeah? -- Go downstairs to your garage, now. Don't ask any questions,
I'll be there in about ten minutes -- Jake?

We'll, what a pleasant surprise
-- There's another one in the back seat

Remember those shell casings?  -- Yeah
-- oil, no fingerprints.  Here's why, look at this they used acid to remove them

and this guy dyes his hair, he's wearing colored contact lenses.

these guys went through a lot of trouble to hide their identities

They tried to kill me tonight. They're professionals.
I need to know who they are, Ray

Well, this guy's had major surgery.  That's a start.

Look, I need to keep this between you and I, know what I'm saying?
-- Hey, I'm up for this, I'm in.

So what're you gonna do?

Are you okay?  --  Yeah

I need to find Carlos Sanchez.
He's the missing piece

How many guards in Section C and D?
-- In section C, only one, we terminate

there's an add'l maintenance man ten yards past the freight elevator,
it'll be closing time, so he won't be too alert, we terminate

We follow the ramp 12.3 yards until we hit Section D.
We can expect no more than three guards, we terminate

That's it

A few more jobs like this and we can retire
-- And you thought working for the Dept was fun?

We lost five years in prison, I can't wait to see this city in ashes

Believe me, the crescendo will soon be heard.
It'll burn, it will burn good

Kane and Levinger still haven't checked in
-- Has Barett's body been discovered yet?  -- Nothing on the scanner

Barrett 's dropped out of sight  -- Appears Barrett
is functional again  -- Maybe he just got lucky

I don't believe in luck.  We will take of Barrett in a different way

I just got off the phone with Barrett,
somebody tried to kill 'im last night

He wants to have a meeting with me, right away.
-- Where at?  -- Spanky's

You sure on that, chief?  -- He's down

Barrett's crazy, but he ain't no fool. Besides,
he actually may do something that saves us a lot of time

Ah, haa, now we're getting somewhere.

Remember, once inside the safe, he'll have
two-and-a-half minutes. -- What if it's closed?

If the safe is closed, I'll be inside in four minutes
-- It's too long, make sure it stays open

Eight-Ball in the side pocket  -- Thousand dollars
Barrett's off'd by sunrise  -- Tap's been activated

This is Barrett Auto Body, I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you

Hey, Jake. Jake, you there? It's Ray  -- Damn  -- Listen I ID'd one of our friends

So get back to me soon as you can, Ok  -- Ray, Ray, it's me, what do you got? -- Are you ready for this?

The guy had a plastic heart valve, it's French made.
Only two places in the country you can get 'em.

Now, I was able to ID him through his blood type and X-rays
-- Alright, where should we meet?

Listen, meet me in the alley at 8th and Atlantic, okay.
One more thing, your hunch was right, my friend

What? cops?
-- I'll tell you about it when I see you

You will never meet Barrett

Hey, Raymond

Ray!

Jake... my pocket

Ok, Ray, I got it

Now it's my turn

Let's get the fuck out of here --  Move it
You honky, motherfucker

Hello  -- It's Jake Barrett
Hey, Jake, How you been?

It's been a long time, huh?
-- What the hell is going on, Crowe?

well, there's been a murder, you've been ID'd
as the shooter -- Who's been murdered?

a gang member, named 8-Ball.  Listen Jake, why don't we sit down huh?

We'll meet, talk this over, see what's going on

Sorry, I'm not up for conversation right now Crowe
-- Jake this is serious

yeah, I know. And don't bother tracing the call
-- Jake? Jake!

Get 'im!

Yes  -- No luck on Carlos,
but we found his sister

I just need an address
-- 1824 Delaney, we'll pick her up

No, no, no. I'll handle this myself

Excuse me, -- Yeah
-- You seen this kid around here?

It's okay, I'm a cop
-- Yeah, I know where he is

Ms Sanchez?  -- Yes  -- I'm officer Green,
I gotta talk with you  -- About what?

It's about Jake Barrett. We used to work together,
not too far from here. I need to talk to him.

Try directory assistance
-- Yeah, Jake told me about you

He said you're someone who can be trusted.  The Dept is looking for Jake,
they have this crazy idea that

crazy idea that he's involved in the murder of a gang member.
He's in trouble, I've gotta warn him

What is your badge number, Officer Green?

3-5-6-2

Charlotte, easy!

Thank you 
-- I got two of my own, Jake also likes kids

They say the motive for the murder was Jake was
trying to get information on a missing boy... your brother

I'm very sorry to upset you

Officer Green, he called me this morning

He went to Griffith Park

Charlotte, where's Rebecca?

Carlos?  My name is Jake Barrett.
I'm a friend of your sister's.

I'm here to help you

I'm not here to hurt you, Carlos.

I'm gonna put my gun down, okay?

You,, you don' know my sister!  -- Yes, I do
-- You don't know my sister!

That's how I knew you were here, estar en paz

I know something terrible happened that night,
I'll take care of it

You don't have to be afraid anymore, Carlos
-- I'm tired

I don't want to be running no more

You and me both

Officer,

Not again

I was scared, man

He was killing everybody,
I didn't know what to do

You think you can identify him?
-- I'll never forget his face, man

The look in his eyes... he wanted me dead

The problem is, I can't go back

See, I didn't do anything, I didn't help my homeboys.
I ran. They're going to kill me.

Not when they hear the truth, Carlos.
That there was nothing that you could've done

So we have something in common.
I've been through this before.

We're not goint to have to run anymore

It's this shack, let's check it out

You usually hear cars around here -- No never.  The cops
only come around at night, to check things out

I need you to hang tough.
Try to get us out of here

This way

We've sighted the target, we're in pursuit
-- Come on

There!

Faster, faster, come on!

get up, man

yeah, alright!

Hello? - Lucinda, it's Jake
-- Rebecca is gone

What do you mean, she's gone? -- IDK, I thought it was the police

but when I called them,
they didn't know nothing about it

then I got a call from someone who says he wants you

to bring Carlos down to the
train yard tonight at nine, alone

And then work out a deal, What're you gonna do, baby?

Whatever it takes

John Cain, ahh, the guy with the artificial heart

Joined the LAPD in '78, convicted of corruption and brutality

served five years with seven other officers

Charles Levinger, Harvery Cruise,

Holy shit,  James Franklin

Captain Special Forces, military
intelligence three years...

LAPD, decorated,, led unit two years in arrests.

Commander of Operation Dropkick.
Infiltrated gang activity, in secret...

ahh, wait.  That's him, that's the
one I saw in the alley.  -- Are you sure?

Like I said, I'm never gonna forget that face, yeah, I'm sure

okay, Raymond.  Where can I find him?

I want you to stay here, tonight.  I've got
some stuff I gotta take care of

They've got my sister, don't they?

Yeah, they got her

They want me to take you to the train yard tonight
-- Then, I'm coming with you  --- No, you're not

They'll kill you on sight -- What about my sister?
-- She's safer without you there

She's the bait.  Unless they find you, she's safe

But I can't just...  -- Look, I don't
have time to argue with you

about this.  Emilio is waiting

Look, he understands everything.
I need you to stay here tonight

Alright  - Hey
-- Don't worry,  I'll handle it

You like my sister?

Yeah, sure, I like your sister.
-- You wanna know something man?

What? -- You're not good enough for her

He's probably right

This is your room.  This used to be my
son's room before he got married

Mi casa es tu casa

Thanks

All secure

Roger, we're proceeding as planned.
We're on our way

Tunnels..

Vaults...

Hey, Barrett

I've been waiting for this

Where is she?

Fuck you!

618 Olive, October 19. That's today!

You guys with New Shield Plumbing!
Yeah we got a call about a leak

Yours

Put him in the van

Clear!

Hey, Lt., you just got a call about a 211 in progress
at Alameda Mall (?)  -- Who made the call?

Jake Barrett

Come on, let's take a ride

Everybody eyes on the floor, and you will not be harmed

Silence!  Do not move, and you will not be harmed!

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

Bingo!

Stauts?
-- All clear

Time!

20 seconds to the elevator

Let the fat lady sing

Let's go!

Move it!

That's it, back it up, back it up, facing the wall

Excuse me, one second
--  Yeah?

Would you make sure that Lt. Crowe gets this please?
-- Yeah, sure  -- Thank you

He's alone, he didn't bring the kid
-- That was to be expected

We'll use the girl to smoke out her brother

Take him out,  Barrett(?)

Guys

Very slowly, toss the gun away

One time,  Where is she?

Think about it

Hey Barrett, you should've brought the kid!

hah shit!

You've been setting us up all along, man

My brother ain't coming home again

He's fucken finished

Let's get them other motherfuckers

That was for Jesus, and my homies

A familiar situation, ay Barrett?

Let her go.

You know the routine, Barrett

Put down the gun..., and I'll let her live

Put down the fucken gun

Loose it

You never could make the right decision

Wait, wait... we're not clear.. wait

It ends tonight, Barrett!

You wouldn't shoot a man in the back, would you?
-- The fuck I wouldn't...

Good night, sweet prince,. And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!

You okay? -- I'm okay

Becca, you alright?

I'm okay

Did you do all this?

Yeah,

I explained to everybody what was going on

How they were being set up... I convinced them

Hey Barrett

Make sure you come in and file a statement

You'll find the statement forms,
right next to the re-instatement forms

I'll think about it
-- You do that

What do you got?

Officer Moe, will you please
get this creep out of here

This is a night, I'll never believe it

Like I said Fernandez,

One day at a time

One day at a time
