and our link is cleanly severed.

We're done.


Sorry,
I don't think I'm back yet.

It's OK. You need a break?
No, it's fine.

Let's just finish.

Go on, then.


Mm,
this is my grandfather's pipe.


And he died before I was born.

Um, my father gave it to me.

Next.

This is also mine. Uh...

I killed and mounted it
one summer when I was a girl,

and then I felt guilty about it.

I still feel guilty about it.
Very good.

Next.

This isn't mine.

Are you sure?
I've never seen it before.


Very good.

All the results are normal
across the board.

No evidence of charring,
no false psyche

from your time as Holly Bergman.

You look surprised.
Anything you wanna flag?

Any, um, anomalies
during interface?

No. No, I'm fine.

It's important not to withhold.

I said I was fine.

OK, good.

Our next contract's almost
finalized, and it's a big one.

I can't have my star performer
falling apart on me.

I would like to take
some time, though.

Time for what?

Well, I've been talking
to Michael

and I told him
that I'd take some time.

Michael.

Isn't he...?

You and Michael...

are separated.

Yeah, of course we are.

But I've been talking to him.

You're not safe for them
anymore, are you?

You told me yourself
you'd become a danger.

Did I say that?


Hi, darl...

Hi, darling!

Wha...? What have you got there?
What have you got?

Hi, darling.
What have you got there?

God! I'm absolutely starving.

I am absolutely starving,
Michael.

Michael, I'm absolutely...
I'm absolutely starving.


Mum!
Hi, darling.

Tas?
Hi.

We have food.
Good, I'm absolutely starving.

Hey, get down from there.

[MEOWS]
[SIGHS]

How was your trip?
It was fine.

Yeah.
Dull, extraordinarily dull.

I can't tell you how glad I am
to be back in town.

How is the paper?

How's it coming?
It's coming along.

Although Dennis tells me

the new editor's

Someone who's old

and stupid - they're not gonna
like what I'm writing.

You're quite old.
Oh. You're quite charming.

'Police have revealed

When did you get so clever?

No. Please do.

with this voluptuous,
young undergraduate student,

his shirt open
to the middle of his chest.

He's playing loud Indian music
and he's going on about Shakti

and the feminine power

Meanwhile, this girl looked
traumatized cos, well,

he's 65 years old and his chest
is more than slightly hairy.

It's a war crime. No, it was
literally reaching for her.

You know, I'm convinced it

and it scuttles around the halls
of the girls' dormitory,

warm toilet seats

and slurping at the thighs of
menstruating Buddhism students.

Only the menstruating ones?

It's got an iron deficiency,
which in this case

can be deadly
because it leads to hair loss.


[MICHAEL WHISPERING] I'm sorry.

I didn't think... I didn't think
they'd stay so long.

Why don't you ask them
to leave, then?

[LAUGHTER IN OTHER ROOM]

Girder, hi, it's Vos.

I just wanted to apologize
for not being myself yesterday.

I think I hadn't fully shed
when we tested.

Anyway, I'm ready for work now
and... call me.

Yeah, please call me.
Thank you.


Who was that?
Uh... Work.

Yeah, I might have
to fly out again.

I thought they were
giving you a break.

Yeah.

Uh... Something's come up.

I want you to move back in
with us.

I hate this.

Tas.

Tas!


I'm becoming old.

I barely recognize myself
anymore.

I'm too old for the machine,
I... I can't take the strain.

As time goes on, it's becoming
increasingly important

for me to find a replacement.

I thought that would be you.

I'm not normally
a bad judge of character.

I would be honored.

You have a very special nature,

one we've worked hard together
to unlock and refine.

And yet,

even I can see a small thread
running from your skull

to a life I thought
you'd moved on from.

Sometimes, that's all it takes
to lose control,

that small thought,
like a tiny fracture.

I wanna show you
some photographs we retained

from your work
on the Holly Bergman job.

Why stab Elio Mazza?

You were provided with a pistol.

Do you want this?

Zoothroo?
Data mining.

Largest operation

But our deal is with Reid Parse,

And what's the narrative?

Um, well, imagine Colin Tate

'Ultimately, he breaks...'

With Ava out of the picture,
Reid inherits everything,

Clean tragedy.
No unanswered questions.

Pay is significant -

But the real target,

according to corporate,
is Zoothroo itself.


Because once we own Reid,
we own the company.

Right.

So, when do I start?

You smell good.
Stop, I need to shower.

Have you found our treats yet?
What do you want?

I need a line of something to
get me started on my to-do list.

There's so much to do,
I can't figure out how to start.

I don't think there's any left.

[VOS, MIMICKING] I don't think
there's any left.

That's sad news.

there's any left.

Why don't I help with the list?

Well, it's not a list
you'd understand.

Half of it's a list
of other lists

and the other half is
a coded list of internal chores.





Do you wanna get dinner?
Do you wanna get dinner?

I'd rather not go out.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

'Wait till I'm back.
We'll unpack together.

Let me get my jacket.'

Watch your levels this time.
My levels are fine.

Just keep me in really deep
cos I don't want any problems.

Sure, Miss Vos,
I'll keep you in nice and deep.

You just make sure you pull
the trigger on the way out.

What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

Just look forward.

All right. Interface is active,
and we're at full power.

This might be a bit
of a rough jump.

[VOS] Just do it.
As you wish.


[RADIO ON]

Could you put the kettle on
for me?

Oh. Yeah, of course.

You smell good.

I need a shower.

You're in a good mood
this morning.

Have you seen my powders?
Powders?

Mm. Tins of protein
and tea powders in a box?

Gonna brew us some Damiana.

You'll like it.
It's an anti-depressant.

I haven't.

I didn't hear you get in
last night.

I couldn't get a flight
until late. Barely slept.

How was the trip?

Thrilling.

Throomatics

played a vital
team-building game.

How was the rest
of your rotation?

What's with you today?

What do you mean?

What do you mean?
I don't know.

You've gone strange on me.


[MUFFLED PA ANNOUNCEMENT]



Good morning.
Mr Tate.

This week I want you on curtains
and blinds.

The guide is loaded
at your station.

Tate! I fucking did it!

I fucking went for it,
and it was incredible.

You did it?
[LAUGHS]

You know those east coast girls,
man, it was revolting.

It was inhuman. I'll never get
the sin stain out.

What about you, sir?

Did you find time
in your professional sojourn

to die with your little
head-office side project?

Well now, Eddie,
what do you think?


I always considered it
your moral obligation

to cuckquean
the boss's daughter.

[SPEECH UNCLEAR]


Uh...

Brown curtains.

Grommet pleat.

Standard bar.

None visible.



Venetian blinds.

Shear.

White cloth.


Mr Tate?'

Hello?

'You're moving at
a snail's pace. Focus.'


Sorry.


Looks like... shears.

No pleat visible.


[DISTORTED VOICES]


[LABORED BREATHING]


I'm here.
'What happened?'

What do you mean?

'Your levels spiked
and I couldn't reach you.'

Nothing. I was in the mine.
I couldn't speak freely.

'You're at the
Zoothroo building.'

Yes.
I just started Colin's shift.

Everything seems
perfectly normal.

No disruption on this end.

'I don't understand.'

You should probably talk
to our new tech.

He probably let me surge
on the controller end.

Tell him to watch his levels.

a deep analysis.

But you report back
if you see anything -

minor artefacting, sync loss.

'We can't afford any mistakes
on this one.'

[COLIN and VOS] Don't worry.
I have it under control.

Hey, Tate. You OK?
Yeah, why?

Well, I saw you, uh...
run out of the mine.

You're not looking so hot.
I'm fine.

If you say so.

They're having some of us come
in on Saturday to do lampshades.

Your name's at the top
of the list.

Why do I get the sense the boss
doesn't like you?

[DRIER BLOWING]


[SOFT MUSIC, WOMAN'S LAUGHTER]



[AVA] Where've you been?
I don't know.

Uh... Sorry.
I forgot my ringer was off.

I had to work a double.
You have to text me.

I almost called the police.


Come and have a line with us.

You're an absolute ghoul, Colin,
a ghoul.

Stop it.
She doesn't have to stop.

I can tell her to stop
if I want to.

Well, there are like,
correct modes of conduct.

This isn't
the state of fucking nature.

You two should talk.
Oh, at Zoothroo.

Um, nice to meet you.

We met. I guess
it wasn't that memorable.

[WOMAN SNIGGERS]

When do you start?
Yesterday.

Ava says you're still
on the floor.

Why would you want that job?



I hear the floor is on par
with lower-end sweat shops.


of subjecting my most
serious lovers

to some insidious form
of trial by ordeal.

In this case, I think the shape
of Colin's psychological scars

will determine his innocence.

Well, and I'm sorry, Ava,

but why not just say "fuck you"
to the old man and quit?

[AVA] Colin?
Who is this?

[MUSIC PLAYING]
What?

type of mind must get off

on violating people's lives
like that.

I mean, seriously,

how much pussy
do you see at work every day?

Reeta!

Well, I can only imagine
the stuff he sees over there.

I jerk off every day
in front of my webcam

so that Zoothroo knows which
brand of vibrator I'm using.

We know and you can stop now.

[FAUCET RUNNING]

Oh! I'm... sorry.

What are you doing?
Drying my hands.

I've missed you.
Can we be friends again?

Ava doesn't care.
She doesn't mind at all.

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Good.

[MUSIC MUFFLED THROUGH WALL]

[INHALING VAPE]

[MUSIC STOPS]

[DOOR OPENS]

Sorry, didn't think
they'd stay so long.

It's all right.

What's going on with you?

I'm fine.

I'm just so tired.

Is that it?

You seem so deformed
these days.

I'm starting to worry
it's something I've done to you.

You don't have to keep
the Zoothroo job

if it's killing you.
I'm fine!

I swear on my life, I'm fine.

That's such a weird thing
to say.

I mean...

Fuck!

Fuck, Colin!

You don't have to talk about it,
but it's hard sometimes.

I don't think
I'm asking for much,

just some basic level of access.

Ava.

I'm just crashing.

I love you.

I love you, too.

[GROANING SENSUALLY]

[COLIN/VOS] Girder.

Girder, please respond.


Normal. I'm right in the body.
What about Melis?

'Analysis here was inconclusive.
It's very strange.'

Don't sound so worried.

I'm one-to-one with the host
right now. I can feel it.

I'm completely clear.

Besides, Parse's dinner party
is tonight.

I'll be out
in less than 24 hours.

'All right, good.
I want you to recalibrate.

'My closest friends and allies,

'I'd like to end tonight

that I am bored with you.

[CROWD LAUGHS]

I am bored
because you are all so flawless.

And our operation has become
so flawless

that I find myself
with nothing to do.

Nothing rustles the bushes.

And in my boredom,
an egg has hatched.

And from it has come
the very special next stage

in the evolution of our work.

To boredom!
To boredom!

[MUSIC, HUM OF LIVELY
CONVERSATION]

Ready for this?

Yeah, of course I am,
why wouldn't I be?

Well, I love my father,
but he's an atrocity.

He's a great man.
He's really not.

I'm not even sure he's human.

He's just like this giant,
human-shaped protozoan

that feeds off misery.

Come on.

Daddy?

Darling, you've brought a boy
home with you.

Good evening, Mr Parse.
Yes. [CHUCKLES]

We were just discussing
the psychology

of failing as a parent.

You start to embrace it,
I think,

when you realize
there's nothing else you can do.

Mr Boyko also has daughters.

Alex
Colin.

Colin works for me now.
Oh?

Yes, I, uh... I found him a job

that, hopefully,
isn't beyond his skillset.

Managing to keep
your head above water, Colin?

I'm fine. Thanks.
Good, good.

You let me know if it gets
too difficult for you.

[CLEARS THROAT]

You need a drink.
Yeah.

Wait here.
I'll be back with gin.

OK.

I'm in place.


Tonight, I want you to get in
a fight with Parse.

Get yourself thrown out,
something public,

and later you can go back
and we'll finish this.


[HUM OF CONVERSATION]

[CONVERSATION UNCLEAR]

What the...?

You OK?
I'm sorry.

want... You want another drink?

No, I'm fine.

[JOHN CHUCKLING]

Can we help you?

I've a feeling you owe me
an apology?

Oh, is that right?

I have a feeling.

My... My future son-in-law,
everyone.

We're just having
a little chat here, Colin,

so why don't you fuck off
into a corner somewhere?

Don't dirty my floor.

[JOHN LAUGHS]

I'll leave when Ava's done with
my fucking cock in her mouth.

Ah, hey!

Hey, that's enough.

[GUESTS GASPING]
Fuck off! Get the fuck off!

You think you can step on me?
I'm a giant!

I'm a fucking giant!
Colin!

Fuck off, you bitch!
[JOHN] Get him out!

You fucking bitch!

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

[COCKS GUN]


Shit!

I don't think
I can go home tonight.

You stay here.

Your room's been waiting.

You haven't been helping.

You're such a creature.
You're unbearable.

I'm going to bed.
Yeah.

Why don't you run off to fucking
Dubai with your mother, then?

Dubai and goodbye.

[DOOR OPENS, SHUTS]

[UNSCREWS BOTTLE CAP]

We're now tracking him

There's already a degree

Hey, what...?
What are you doing here?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, look.

Look, I did it. Uh...

I did it, you know, so that
we can be together. I did it.

What? What have you done?
I did it. I did it.

I was just...
I was just... I was angry.

They... They...
They attacked me.

All I was doing
was defending myself.

Colin, you're not making
any sense.

I should have stayed
with Michael.

Who's Michael?

I don't know.

Oh, my God.
Fuck! You're bleeding.

OK, come on, sit down. Sit down.

Oh, yeah, I tripped on the way
over here and I...

I hit my head.
[WATER RUNNING]

OK, well, you're going to have
to go to the hospital

because you probably
have a concussion.

No, I'll be all right.

Sorry if I scared you.

Scare me?

Here.

You want some water, or gin?

It's water or gin,
that's all I got. [CHUCKLES]

I'm just getting ready
to go to the airport.

Chicago.
Mm-hm.

When I get back,
we should see each other.

Ava and I had a fight.

Can I stay here?

I can't go home.

Poor baby.


OK, two nights.

Leave the key at the desk

OK?
Right, I'm gonna take a shower.

How did you know I was here?
Reeta called me over.

You know Reeta?
Sure do. Hey, get me a drink.

Oh, yeah.


There you go.
You're coming back.

Oh, whoa, whoa.

Let's be civil.

Girder sent me.
I'm your lifeline.


Girder?
I was a plant.

You didn't know?
I'm a collaborator.

I scouted Tate

Come on, come on.

There we go.

I've heard a lot about you,

It's real honor. I was a huge

I can't seem

Oh, no, no, no.
I'm a Christian.

Besides, Girder says
it has to be you.

Sit down! Hands on the table!

Get your hands on the table.

She travels for work. I don't
think she's in the country.

Do you recognize me?
Do you know me?

I need to know.

I need to know what she's done
to me, do you understand?

Tell me what this is about.
Maybe I can help.

Do you ever think of your wife
as a predator?

Hm, do you ever think of her
that way?

I don't know.
I don't understand.

Don't look at me.
Get your head down.

Do you ever worry about
parasites, like the cat?

What?

Just think, one day your wife
is cleaning the cat litter

and she gets a worm in her,

and that worm ends up
in her brain.

The next thing that happens is
she gets an idea in there, too.

And it's hard to say
whether that idea is really hers

or it's just the worm.

And it makes her do
certain things.

Predator things.

Eventually, you realize that she
isn't the same person anymore.

She's not the person
that she used to be.

It's gotta make you wonder...

whether you're really
married to her...

or married to the worm.

Are you seeing this,
you fucking bitch? I'll do it.

Come out or I'll do it!


What are you doing here?

Tas.

I've been looking for you.
I wanted to talk.

Why?

What have you done to me?

Done to you?

You're the one in control.


I haven't been in control
of myself lately.

But you have.

Where's Ava?

Where's your lovely girl?

Can't you remember?

No, that wasn't me.

Of course it was.

Poor Michael.

I loved him, too.

But I'm not sure if it was me.

I'll kill him.

You fix this
or I swear I'll kill him.

Go ahead. Do it.

He's only holding you back.

This is what
you've always wanted.





Pull me out.



Pull me out.

to take a break?


OK.

This is my grandfather's pipe.

He died before I was born.

My father gave it to me.


Next?

This is also mine.

I killed and mounted it one
summer when I was a little girl.

Very good.
