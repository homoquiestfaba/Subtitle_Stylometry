   Of Lewis and Clark, 1805.    

         So, David Zara         
       for William Clark.       

      And can you tell us       
       how tall you are?        

       Uh, as I can play        
          any height.           

     That's how good I am.      

        You know, David,        
          I gotta say,          

        weÕre both huge         
     "Little genius" fans.      

         Ah, man, huge.         
      we love it, love it.      

          Cool, guys.           
        yes, thank you.         

    It was a long time ago,     
         but, you know.         

         How did it go,         
     it was like, he's a...     

     -Oh, wow, wait.            
      And the catchphrase--     

      -"Does not compute."      
      -Oh, yeah, yeah.          

   -"That does not compute."    
   - Okay.              

     No, that was the, um,      
  the robot-- "Little genius"   

        -who said that.         
        -Oh.                    

         But I was like         
       the straight man,        
          like, ãawe.Ó          

           You know?            

   Um, I don't remember that.   

           Hey, well,           
     should we get started?     

            Surely.             

       Pacific. Pacific.        

          Meriwether?           

          Meriwether,           
      Stop paddling. Yon.       

       It's the Pacific!        

   It's the Pacific at last!    

       Hi, this is David.       

        I can't come to         
      the phone right now       

        Because I am on         
         my honeymoon.          

       Call you in a week       
        when I get back.        

     -Hi David, it's Fula,     

       Your BFF forever.        

   I hope you're doing okay.    

        I know probably         
   the answer is "Not okay,"    

        but don't worry.        

         your best man          
   is coming to cheer you up.   

      Get ready for a nice      
          gassy ball.           

       It will make sense       
     in just some seconds.      

            Bye-bye.            

      Good morning, David.      

              Hey.              

             Okay.                 

        Look who's here         
     to brighten your day.      

              No?               

           These rays           
        have no effect?         

      Here, have a bottle.      

           Ooh, rosÉ.           
           I like it.           

  Frankie cancels the wedding.  

           She takes            
     all of the furniture,      

    but on the bright side,     

            I have a            
        lifetime supply         
            of rosÉ.            

     Things are looking up.     

     -What are you wearing?      
     -What am I wearing?        

             David,             
     what are you wearing?      

    You look like kangaroo.     

      You know marsupials       

        actually travel         
       in pairs, though.        

"From the pen of William Clark. 

      Every great journey,      
      like a giant redwood      

       begins, initially,       
        as a small seed.        

   On the day my old friend,    
Meriwether Lewis came to visit, 

     I was entirely unaware     
        that he had come        

    to plant this very seed     

         into my life."         

             David,             
         we need to get         
          you outside.          

 You've been in here for like,  
         what, a week?          

       You need some sun        
          on your face          

         and your body,         
       your legs, torso.        

      We were gonna start       
      our honeymoon today.      

         One week hike          
  wouldÕve been very romantic.  

         It's too late          
    to return all this gear.    

      -Did you cancel it?       
      -No.                      

        You're outside,         
are you like just in the forest 

    and nature with someone     
    you like and care about?    

         Yeah, it just          
         wouldÕve been          

         Me and Frankie         
           out there.           

         But FrankieÕs          
         not available.         

        Yeah, I'm aware         
        of that, Flula.         

     -Thank you.                
     -No, I'm just saying,      

       sounds like a trip       
     that is not cancelled      

   and that it would be nice    
  to maybe have companionship   

   on this wonderful journey.   

              Mm.               
       It would've been.        

             David.             

        What did Rudy do        

       when he could not        
         make the sack?         

            "Rudy,"             
      the football movie?       

        Exactly. "Rudy."        
         You are Rudy.          

      And these opponents,      
the enemy team, and the people. 

      This is like Frankie      
     and the wedding cancel     

     and all the sad times      
         in your life.          

   You are there on the field   
        and you're like,        

       "What the-- help!        
      I would like to make      
       a sack, perhaps."        

      Nobody can see you.       
         You are tiny.          

   But do not worry, DavidÑ    
         I mean, Rudy,          

       You have friends.        

            You have            
       the other players        
          on the team,          

      The tall boyfriends       
 with the jerseys and numbers.  

          This is me.           

         And the crowd          
       who cheer for you?       

          Rudy! Rudy!           

             Rudy!              
       This is me, also.        

      And I'm the grasses       
          and the sky.          

         I'm-- I'm all          
    of these things, David.     
      I'm helping you out.      

  You'll win the championship.  

   And I will help you, Rudy.   

          Let's do it.          

        Yeah, so, wait.         
 You want-- what're you saying? 

       We are going to go       
  on your honeymoon together.   

   -No, no.                     
   -N, this is great, David.   

     -Awful.                    
     -No, we're doing this.     

       Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!        

             Rudy.              

       Rudy. Rudy. Rudy.        

             -What?             
             -Rudy.             

             -Rudy.             
             -Rudy.                   

      Okay, David.      
 So this is my first honeymoon. 

            Tell me,            
        what will we do?        

      Well, it's gonna be       

          Seven days,           
         seven nights,          

          hike through          
        the wilderness,         

        gorgeous vistas,        
       rugged overlooks.        

  That sounds amazing, David.   

      And on the last day,      
    thereÕs a special treat.    

           One night            
        in the big piney        

       wilderness lodge.        

   Ooh, sounds very romantic.   

        Yeah, that's...         

     kinda the weird thing      
          about this.           

         How many beds?         

            One bed.            

  But I'm sure they will bring  
     a cot in or something.     

          Uh! Got you!          

        Okay, so we will        
     ãcotÓ the bed in half      

       -To make two beds?       
       -NoÑ god, no, no!       

         A cot is like          
         a smaller bed          

     that they can lend us      
  in addition to the one bed.   

   So we'll have three beds?    

          Fair enough.                   

  David, I've heard there are   
       magical creatures        

      -In this forest?          
      -No, there are not.       

        Yeah, like yetis        
  and leprechauns, werewolves.  

         The sasquatch.         

 Okay, I'll tell you right now  
      that does not exist.      

        I've seen photos        
         of sasquatch.          

     Well, I've seen photos     
          of godzilla.          

         Have you seen          
         "Die hard 2"?          

        I have not seen         
         "Die hard 2."          

       So maybe the film        
         doesnÕt exist.         

             Yeah.              

      Shh, shh, shh, shh.       
             Hello?             

            Shut up.            
       You're kidding me.       

     You know, I will have      
    my phone on me all week.    

         I'm reachable.         
           Okay, bye.           

          Woo hoo hoo!          
       That was my agent.       

        -Yeah?                  
        -Okay, I went in        

    For this Lewis and Clark    
   bio pic for William Clark.   

      They really like me,      
     and I'm gonna find out     

  -in the next couple of days.  
  -Oh, david, I'm so happy.     

        You-- you think         
   I'll get reception, right?   

      -Oh, in the forest?       
      -Yeah.                    

             N-no.              
            No, no.             

   We're in the boonie-docks    
           right now.           

          -You ready?           
          -Yeah.                

          I entered us          
    in the registry, David.     

    This way, if a sasquatch    
     or something eats us,      

     our parents will find      
        our limbs okay.         

      That's a good idea.       

     -Haha! Let's do this!      
     -Oh, yeah.         

        Bound it, David.        
           Bound it.                 

            Ho-hoo!             

-Are you looking at this, Flula?
-I see it, David.               

     -What did I tell you?      
     -I love it.                

     Exactly what I needed.     

      This is my therapy.       
       my antidepressant.       

       Suck it in, David,       
          Suck it in.           

   What does it bring to mind   
            for you?            

       It's like heaven,        
      but with real trees.      

  This is the greatest thing.   

      "The wooded country,      

         through which          
          we now pass           

       is the most rugged       
       and most beautiful       

       I have ever seen.        

 But this beauty belies surely  
  belies some unknown danger.   

        I am no coward,         
           but I fear           

          that not all          
      will make it across       
         the continent.         

          But for now,          
    all are in good spirits.    

  Not a whisper of discontent   
  can be heard among the men.   

        We act in unison        

         with the most          
       perfect harmony."           

             Okay.              

     David, can we increase     
        our pace a bit?         

            Oh, god.            

          Hey, David,           
      We're slowing down.       

      Move those tiny legs.     

           Good god.            

             Whoa.              
   What's the altitude here?              

        Wow, these, uh--        

          These packs           
        Are heavy, huh?         

        -No, not really.        
        -Pretty light.          

  -Are you okay?                
  -Yeah, I just, uh--

           Think that           
     morning bottle of rosÉ     
     is catching up to me.      

      That was a bad idea.           

      Let's sweat it out.       
             Come.              

    Just push out that rosÉ,    

          Push it out           
       your pores, David.       

          -David?               
          -Oh, my god.               

 -Oh, my god.                   
 -DonÕt let the trail hike you. 

         You must hike          
       the trail, david.        

             Come.              

           Haha-hah!            

             Yeah!               

           Feel it in           
       your lungs, david.       

     My legs are tingling.      

          Oh, nature.           
     You're so refreshing.      

          You're like           
       an Arnold Palmer.        

    You're like a cigarette.    

 But not filled with nicotine,  
     youÕre filled with...      

            Nature.             
            Woo ahh!            

     I can't feel my butt.      

          Ah haha hah!          

     Nature, I suck you in.          

          Oh, my god.           

     I can't feel my toes,      
      which I understand,       

  But I can't feel my fingers,  
        which scares me.        

            How far             
   did we walk today, david?    

     We walked two point--      

       just two miles.         

      How many more miles       
            remain?             

              84.               

        I think we need         
        to walk faster.         

          Yeah, okay.           

       All right, David.        

    We are ready for a hike.    

           Oh, David,           
  Do you know how like, when--  

       When small things        
        you carry them,         

   They help you move faster    
  more nimble like a leopard?   

    Let me show you a trick     
         from my father         

   I learned on a volksmarch.   

             -Here.             
             -Okay.             

       Yeah, here we go.        

     -Ugh. Yeah. Siest du?      

        You've beheaded         
         my toothbrush.         

  Now it's six grams lighter,   
          approximate.          

  What do I do with the other   
       95 percent of it?        

       Oh, you will carry       
   that in your pocket until    
      we find a trashcan.       

   -Yeah, yeah, that's, uh...   
   -Excellent.                  

         Then you will          
       move faster, yes?        

        Going on a hike         
     with my friend David.      

     Who is right behind me     
           for sure.            

      Oh, look, I found--       
       I found a pyramid        

   -Or something interesting.   
   -Okay, wait up.              

       You should see it.       
    itÕs disappearing quick.            

     There's so many great      
      Sounds here, David.       

    "One of our great tasks     

          is to record          
        native specimens        

        in this new part        
       of the continent."       

    Note, record leaf slaps.    

     "Meriwether has taken      
    a keen interest in this.    

         Even employing         
      a special apparatus       
      in these pursuits."       

    It's photosynthesizing.     
           Right now.           

 "I too have joined Meriwether  
       in this endeavor."       

          -ItÕs gross.          
          -Ah.                  

   Record more photosynthesis   
      for my synthesizer.       

   "And I am eager to assist    
        in the process."        

    What're you doing, man?     

      I'm recording sounds      
         for this song.         

           What song?           

     It's the greatest song     
    that I've ever written.     

   Uh, I see it has not been    
          written yet.          

      Well, that's what's       
          now is for.           

       Wait, stop, stop,        
          stop, stop.           

      -Do that again. No.       
      -What?                    

          -Back, back.          
          -What?                

     Like, shh, like this,      
       just go like this.       

   -Why don't you just do it?   
   -You do it.                  

             Again.             
             More.              

      -What is happening?       
      -Shh!                     

    "Though his methodology     

 is sometimes perplexing"...   

       "Wind tree blow."        
        record tomorrow.        

     "I have no doubt that      
         the president          

    -and future generations     
     of scholars"...            
    -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.      

   ..."Will be much delighted   
   with our new discoveries."   

   -This is perfect c-minor.    
   -Mm.                         

           -You know?           
           -Yeah.               

        I pee in the key        
          of c-minor.           

            You do?             

     In a standard toilet,      
           or course.           

    We'll record that later.    

   Can you pass me the gorp?    

         -Sorry, what?          
         -The gorp.             

           -The gorp?           
           -The gorp.           

           -Gorp?               
           -The gorp.           

           -The gorp?           
           -Gorp.               

     -WhatÕs this?              
     -It stands for, um...      

            It's...             

   Can I have the trail mix?    

        -Oh, yeah, sure.        
        -Thank you.             

     That was right there.      

        You know, Flula,        

        Lewis and Clark         
    hiked through here over     
         200 years ago.         

           Coulda...            
       slept right here.        

 This is gonna be good research 
       if I get the part.       

       Do you think Lewis       
     urinated on that tree?     

           That tree?           

            -Mm-hmm.            
            -No.                

    But if they camped here,    
  you know, to leave the tent   

    -And then--                 
    -Allow me for a second.     

       Clark had a slave        
           Named York           

            Who did             
       the entire journey       
           with them.           

York actually saved Meriweather 
  Lewis from a grizzly attack,  

   He was revered as a brave    
    andÑ and giant of a man    

  by the local indian tribes.   

   At the end of the journey,   
       Clark whipped York       

            For not             
       wanting to go back       
          as a slave.           

            -What?              
            -Awful.             

     -ThatÕs terrible.          
     -Yeah, it's depressing     
      part of the script,       

  And I'm trying to have them   
       tweak the ending.        

        I have an idea.         
   Doing some work on Clark,    
    Clark wouldn't say that.    

Clark would say something like, 
        uh, I love you.         

      You did it with us.       
        I set you free.         

        -Go have a life.        
        -Go, be free.           

        That's my take.         
            Just go.            

      -I like that, David.      
      -Thank you.               

     -Do you know               
      another thing I like?     
     -WhatÕs that?              

          Fast lunches          
        and hard hikes.         

        Oh, you're done.        

   David, I'm fighting time.    

          In 60 years,          
  I'll be dust and molecules.   

           -Wow.                

       So, suck it, time.       

         I'm gonna hike         
      on your face. Right?      

       I'll take my break       
         when we hike.          

   The young bird gets, uh--    
      gets all the worms.       

       Means a tardy bird       
          justÑ ugh,           

          Eats gravel           
         or, you know,          

             sand.              

   Other worms that are dead    
         and smell bad.                 

        Come on, David!           

     Look, David, a human.      

          -Hey, there!          
          -Uh! Jeez.            

           God! Jeez!           

            You guys            
         just scared me         
            so much.            

    I haven't seen somebody     
        in a long time.         

     Hey, what're you guys      
        doing out here?         

  -Oh, we are on a honeymoon.   
  -Oh.

-Have a wonderful life together.
-LetÕs be clear-- friends.      

    -We are honey-buddies.      
    -You guys are gonna make    
     a beautiful family.        

          You're gonna          
       have kids, right?        

           -Yes.                
           -Awesome.            

      -With other people.       
      -Mazel tov.               

        -Thank you.             

        I'm really happy        
         for you guys.          

           Seriously.           

       Did you hear that?       

          What is it?           

     I can't hear anything.     

      What're you hearing?      

           It's gone.                    

        Is it sasquatch?        

       -AhÉ                   
       -Is it a minotaur?       

         -UmÉ                 
         -ItÕs a yeti.          

    We have two in Germany.     

        Well, um, not--         
   not to freak you guys out    
          or anything,          

           But enjoy            
      your time together.       

        -Okay.                  
        -âCause there's         
         these, um--            

        thereÕs wolves.                    

        Was that a wolf?        

             Yeah.              
       They're government       
       experiment wolves.       

      Yeah, they're pumped      
           with GMOs,           

     and they are massive,      
         huge animals.          

     They kill for pleasure     
  and their fangs are huge.   

  And they leave their kill   
      so that you see it,       

        so that you know        
      that you are the one      
     that is being hunted.      

  They've got these huge giant  
      velociraptor claws.       

          But, listen.          

    Have a great honeymoon,     

   Enjoy your time together.    

      Just be cool, okay?       

         Don't sweat...         

       Because they smell       
           the sweat.           

        And, um, listen,        
   I'm gonna give you a-- a--   

      a honeymoon present       
    because I like you guys.    

      They're really good.      

       I grew 'em myself.       

        I'm taking this         
     little family with me      

       Because I watched        
           them grow.           

        There's Norberto        
          and Regina.           

         And, uh, Raul,         
        and SebastianÑ         

     heÕs the youngest one      
         of the family.         

       And they are-- mm.       

          So, listen.           

     Enjoy your honeymoon.      
        Enjoy the hike.         

      Enjoy mother nature.      

      Hey, wait a second.       

        "Little genius."        
    Jesus Christ, that's it.    

   With the little robot guy.   

   That was my favorite part.   

      "Does not compute."       

       "Does not compute.       
     It does not compute."      

  -That was the robot's line.   
  -It does not compute.         

         I was the boy          
       next to the robot.       

     He was the most human      
    part of that whole show.    

      Yeah, everybody else      
     was more like robots.      

        Thanks for being        
        part of my life.        

           All right.           

       That's terrifying        
    about the wolves, David.    

       Oh, don't believe        
          the wolves.           

    David, I have a question    
       about your movie.        

       I don't understand       
  what you were saying earlier  

         about Superman         
        owning a slave.         

             -What?             
             -Well,             

   We have Lewis and ClarkÑ    
       Lewis loves Clark        

          of course--           
        theyÕre lovers,         

        Clark is always         
      in the phone booth,       

    and then he's superman,     
        so, why is he--         

          Whoa, whoa,           
            back up.            

    Um, Lois and Clark Kent     
   are fictitious characters.   

        Lewis and Clark         
      are actual explorers      

     who explored this area.     

           Okay, I--            
       I don't understand       
          who is who,           

           But I want           
      to go on the record       
          and tell you          

           That I am            
        against slavery.        

             So...              

      if you get the role,      

           I may not            
      go to the premiere.       

       I don't even know        
        where to start.         

       How is he like--?        
     heÕs like super fast.      

         Faster than a          
        speeding bullet,        

           more power           
      than a "Locomotion."      

            Oh, yes,            
      and he owns a slave,      

        'cause he cannot        
      carry his knapsack?       

         That's wrong,          
           Superman.            

       "My dearest love.        

         I write to you         
      from the other side       
        of the continent        

       with no knowledge        
         of when or if          

         you will ever          
     receive these words."      

       "I know that when        
     we last saw each other     

     our hearts were heavy.     

   and I pray this finds you    
       in better spirits        

    living a life fulfilled.    

            For me,             
       this new endeavor        

        has been a work         
    of staggering difficulty    

           and, yet,            
     the rewards are many,      

          and we make           
        great progress.         

           I am lucky           
      to travel with a man      

     such as MeriwetherÉ      

       Uniquely qualified       

    to lead this expedition.    

         I was thinking         
          this morning          

          of the days           
          we first met          
          in Kentucky           

     and what a joyous time     
           that was."           

           Ugh                

     -Brilliant.                
      That was a good one.      
     -Great.                    

    -That was a good one.       
    -Oh, good. I felt really    
     good about it.             

      You fooled the biker      
          over there.           

         -Yes.                  
         -Play acting.          

          So watch me           
        do this to you.         

          -Okay.                
          -Oh, craig.           

              Oh!               
      How did that-- yeah?      

          -OhÑ boom!           
          -Oh!                  

             -Oh!               
             -Hah!              

      Again. Don't do this      
       in a street fight.       

       -Okay.                   
       -Cause you won't        
        make contact.           

  -But this isn't good, right?  
  -No, it's just terrible.      

 You don't want to telegraph it 
       in a street fight.       

    You want to telegraph it    
    for the American viewer.    

       -Right.                  
       -Yeah, or whoever        
        gets it abroad.         

      You don't need that.      
        You need-- boom!        

      -Okay, I'm gonna          
       do one more, okay?       
      -Okay, go for it.         

          -Ow!                  
          -Oh, my god!          

    -Oh god, are you okay?      
    -Yeah, yeah, I'm faking.    

         -Oh, my god.           
          I'm so sorry.         
         -Wow!                  

         -ThatÕs okay.          
         -I'm so sorry.         

       You came so close        
   that you actually hit me.    

  -ThatÕs how close you came.   
  -Yeah, it was pretty good.    

 -I really felt it that time.   
 -By the way, it doesn't hurt.  

     -Oh, god.                  
     -ItÕs fine. It's fine.     

   My eyes are only watering    
       'cause of my nose        

     -is really sensitive.      
     -Oh, right.                

      "I hope that someday      
   you will read this letter.   

         and if somehow         
      I return home again,      

         that our eyes          
      will meet once more.      

     yours, william clark."     

           Ah! David!           

          Help, David!          
          I'm trapped!          

         Ah! Oh, David!         

          David, help!          

          Help, David!          

            Oh, god!            

             David!             
          David, help!          

         -Oh, my god!           
         -Rock hit me!          

        -Oh, david!             
        -What happened?         

    The rocks! The rocks!       
    I was recording a tone!     

    Oh, my god! Oh, my god!     
          Oh, my god!           

           Ah!                 

 Dude, I'm getting no service.  
       We can't call out.       

-I don't know what to do.       
-Pretend I'm like James Franco. 

   I'll do-- no, no, no, no!    
       I cannot cut you!        

   -We have to cut it, David.   
   -Oh, no, no, no...           

-No, David, you have to cut it. 
-I didn't want to do this.      

 -This is my honeymoon!         
 -Cut it, David! I'm gonna die! 

             David,             
      you have to cut it.       

          -Take it.             
          -Oh, my god.          

If we don't make it out, David, 
     send my arm to my dad.     

           My father            
       would like my arm.       

     -DonÕt do the tendons.     
     -All right.                

      -The tendons first.       
      -I need a countdown.      

    -Three, two--               
    -No, no, but then what?     

       -What?                   
       -David! If anybody       
        would cut my arm,       

        I would want it         
       to be you, David.        

   Oh man, I'm sorry, buddy.    
     Let's do this, ready?      

            -OneÉ             
            -TwoÉ             

           -Three!                      

       -David, a snack.         
       -Is that ketchup?        

    -Do you have some fries?                  

  -Perhaps some hash browns.    
  -That was really elaborate.   

        -Did I get you?         
        -You did get me.        

  That is so bizarre that you   
    would go to that length.    

  -You are a six-year-old-boy.  
  -Maybe seven.                 

   -ItÕs going to be coming.    
   -I'm ready.                  

        That's my knife,        
          by the way.           

      Do you have a towel?      

        I got reception!        

       Reception's gone.        

        David! Put down         
          your phone,           

          And join me           
        in these waters.        

      Come take a freezing      
   cold bath with me, David.    
       You will love it.        

          Just ignore           
         the shrinkage.         

             David,             
       I have goose skin        
           right now.           

       It feels so good.        

         Oh, hi, ducks.         

      Hopin' for a signal.      

         I need to know         
      if I got this part.       

          Come, David.          

         Increase your          
      hip-moving velocity.      
           Let's go.            

       And I have to talk       
          To Frankie.           

      Oh, David, stop it.       
Focus your face on this nature. 

  "It seems we are now beyond   
   reach of the known world.    

    I think of those at home    
     who have no knowledge      

      Of our well being."       

            Nothing.            

   "If we are alive or dead."   

        Why do you think        
     Frankie contacted me?      

      I mean, do you think      
     that she wants to move     
        back in with me?        

      I don't know, David.      

        Okay, according         
          to this map,          

       We should go onto        
 the other side of this ridge,  

           and there            
        could be a tower        
          over there.           

        We're surrounded        
     only by nature, david.     

     I don't think beavers      
  can build cell phone towers.  

        Well, the phone         
        says otherwise.              

         Nothing still.         

          David, here.          
      I'm slightly taller.      
          Let me try.           

             Okay.              

      Uh! A little higher.      

        Yep. Here we go.        

    All right, cell towers.     
       Smell this phone.        

       Ha! We got it!          

           -We got--            
           -Ah!                 

           Oh, god!                 

              Ugh!              

         -Oh, no, no!           
         -Oh, scheiße.                

    Yeah,                       
    itÕs completely fucked.     

       I'm sorry, David.        
            Scheiße.            

             Here.              
      Get your phone out.       

       I didn't bring it.       
        It's in the car.        

       I-- I didn't think       
     we would have service.                 

 -The maps were in this phone.  
 -Uh, no, that's okay.          

        Before it broke,        
           I checked.           

 We have to go to like a place  
        called Red Fox.         

             Yeah.              

          Well, do you          
      know where that is?       

    We'll find it for sure.     

       How many Red Foxes       
    Are there, David? Right?    

          Uh, I think           
      itÕs Red Fox Hills.       

        Oh, yeah, yeah.         
    Why-- why-- why is that?    

      -ItÕs in my guts.         
      -Uh, we're going          
       with your guts now?      

    That's how we're hiking?    

        Well, what would        
      Lewis and Clark do?       

      They would have used      
    a native american guide     

         or a compass.          

        Compass? Great.         
        Let's use that.         

        Oh, good, yeah.         
   Uh, that was on my phone.    

    So, do you have a guide?    

     I don't have a guide.      

      -LetÕs go that way.       
      -LetÕs do it.             

         It's probably          
         all the same.          

        Come on, David.                   

      "When I first viewed      
        these mountains,        

   I felt a sudden pleasure.    

     But now, as I reflect      
      on the difficulties       

    which this snowy barrier    
       throws in our way,       

       and the sufferings       
  and hardships of our party,   

       it in some measure       
        counterbalances        

     those fond memories."      

     And what are your guts     
        telling you now?        

         I don't know.          
     My gps is down, David.     

      Oh, you have a gps?       

             Yeah.              
  My guts positioning system.   

        It's not working        
      because I'm hungry.       

        I think it needs        
          a sandwich.           

    "After narrowly avoiding    
       ruiness injury"...        

         Come, David.                        

   ..."We look to descending    
   from this retched mountain   

    which we have now named,    
     'wretched mountain.'"      

    Well, this was your idea    
      to do Red Fox Hills.      

      Red Fox is an idiot.      

    We call hills like this     
     in germany mountains.      

  "But we take joy in knowing   
          that tonight          

          we shall bed          
      at the last outpost       
       of civilization."           

       I called my agent.       

        It's between me         
       and one other guy.       

       Oh, that's great.        

       I called Frankie.        
      There was no answer.      

             -Oh.               
             -But,              

   I did pick up another map,   

        and you are not         
       going to touch it.       

  I will treat it like a baby   
         if I touch it.         

     Listen, I mailed this      
         two weeks ago.         

     It was supposed to be      
    for me and Frankie, but     

   -Now it's for me and you.    
   -Ooh.                        

           Champagne.           

 -Hey, buddy.                   
 -Oh, yeah, oatmeal-raisin mix. 

     -Oh, condoms.              
     -We don't need those.      

 -But who knows, David?          
 -Those were not meant for us.          

     And it seems as though     
  you sent yourself a package.  

            It means            
        "Honeybuddies,"         

         but in German.               

          Oh, my god.           

         -ItÕs for you.         
         -ThatÉ               

    is a very orange shirt.     

             Yeah.              

      I selected the color      
          for safety.           

 You know, like if hunters are  
 looking for elks or reindeers, 

          who are we?           

       Humans in shirts.        

      This is ridiculous.       

       Look on the left.        
          That's you.           

  -Oh, slightly shorter.        
  -Well, it's accurate, yeah.   

      -Oh, man, thank you.      
      -Oh, great.               

          Look, okay.           
     I gotta be a grownup.      

         I'm gonna put          
    the whole phone incident    

           behind us.           

   Okay, it was an accident.    

         And honestly,          
    itÕs kind of a blessing     
          in disguise.          

    I-- I'd rather not have     
       the outside world        

      encroaching on this.      

       Well, sorry again        
          about that.           

              Oh.               

        This champagne's        
    not gonna drink itself.     

    No, we are gonna do it.     

     That's what you meant,     
             right?             

          -Yes.                 
          -Okay, then.            

         Party pooper.              

      David, we're empty.       

  We need some more champagne.  

         Let me get it.         

              Ooh.                          

          "Dear David.          

       I just found your        
   secret honeymoon package.    

  And even though I'm probably  
sitting right there next to you,

     I decided to write you     
         a little note.         

   I wanted to just tell you    
  that I'm the luckiest person  

         in the world          
    to have you in my life.     

         I know things          
   havenÕt been easy lately,    

          but I'm sure          
    it will all be worth it.    

     I can't wait to spend      
     the rest of our lives      
           together.            

      Love you like crazy.      

         Your new wife,         

           Frankie."            

   What are you doing, David?   

           Oh, ah...            

          Just getting          
        another bottle.               

       All right, David,        
    I'm going down the creek    

          To get some           
       cool river sounds.       

          -Be careful.          
          -Okay.                 

       Come here, sounds.       

        This is perfect.        

    Take one of rock sounds.    

   "Meriwether has once again   

        left to capture         
        new specimens."         

       Sometimes I worry        
    what might happen to him    
       when he is alone."       

  - Ah, gottverdammt, scheiße.     

      This is what it is.       

          Wer sind da?          
          Who's here?           

     Verdammt noch mal, du.        

            Oh, god.            

         Dude, it's me.         
       It's me. It's me.        

        -David.                 
        -I'm sorry, man.        

          -You got me.          
          -I know,              

         but the thing          
         with the arm.          

        So, we're even.         
        I'm so sorry.           

      -Dude, are you okay?      
      -No.                      

  -Oh, David.                   
  -Uh, we're even now, buddy.   

      We are even Steven.       

         Oh, I'm gonna          
        get you so hard.        

       Oh no, we're done.       
you got me, and I got you back. 

       No, it's my turn.        
      itÕs like a frisbee.      

      No, we can be done.       

     "What drives men to do     
          such things?          

    Are we full of courage?     

          Are we mad?           

      Or do we simply flee      
    what we've left behind?"    

          What do you           
        want me to say?         

       It's not my fault        
     I didn't get the job.      

   I'm actually okay with you   
 putting your career before me. 

   What I have a problem with   
is when you treat me like shit. 

     So after he pulled out     
      the heart, you know,      
         from that man,         

     That's when I decided      
  I'm never visiting Indiana.   

         Yeah, his name         
       is Indiana Jones.        

           That scene           
      took place in india,      

     and that was a movie.      

      Well, I'm not going.      
   I don't care where it is.    

          It's scary.           

          -Hey, guys.           
          -Hello.               

         Let me guess.          
    Uh, best friend forever,    
      David and dj Flula.       

             Yeah.              

    I've been stalking you.     

         I'm kidding.          

        I saw your names        
    on the hiking registry.     

          Ah-hah-hah!           
    That's what you put down    
        in the registry?        

     -Yeah, it's the truth.     
     -Okay.                     

       I guess we must've       
        passed you guys         

           Yesterday            
       at Red Fox Trail?        

              Yes.              
      We actually ended up      
      doing Red Fox Hills,      

   Which was far less direct.   

         -Very scenic.          
         -Cool.                 

       Well, did you guys       
      wanna stay with our       
         group tonight?         

   -We have backpacker beer.    
   -You bet.                    

       Heck, yes, hello.        
   Do bears poop in forests?    

   -That sounds great. Sure.    
   -They do.                    

         Okay, awesome.         
     Um, well, there's a--      

thereÕs a great spot, actually, 
       right over there.        

   You guys wanna go grab it,   
    and I'll meet you there?    

           -Great.              
           -Awesome.            

            -Cool.              
            -Thanks.            

        -BFF.                   
        -ByeÑ bye-bye.         

             David,             
    she is very attractive.     

         Yeah, I guess.         
      If you're into that       
         sort of thing.         

           What? No.            
        She was looking         
         at you, David.         

      No, she was looking       
         at both of us.         

  No, she was looking at you.   

  Stop thinking about Frankie   
         all the time.          

      Start thinking about      
        hot new ladies.           

             Okay.              

        Oh, yeah, David.        

         Yeah, get it.          
    Oh, yeah, looking good.     

       Okay, so, tonight,       
             justÑ             

    You do some good things,    
   and I'll be your wingman.    

    Oh, yeah, I do not need     
       a wingman tonight.       

      -Thank you.               
      -You don't think          
       you don't need one.      

          -Right.               
          -But you do.          

        Hello, everyone.        

           I'm Flula            
       and this is David.       

       -Hi.                     
       -I smell very bad,       

      uh, but David smells      
         really great.          

              So.               

    Do you guys wanna learn     
 how to make backpacking beer?  

         -OhÉ                 
         -Uh, yes, but,         

         if this is a          
        difficult task,         
           watch out.           

       I am very stupid.        

           But David,           
     heÕs like a scientist      
         of the world.          

       It's really easy.        

            I-- I--             
       I'm sure you both        
         will be fine.          

    Uh, this is some water--    

       naturally sourced,       
    that we then carbonated.    

           Step one.            

           And then,            
    here is the concentrate.    

  It's just a teaspoon of this  
    into what you guys have.    

        Just be careful         
        'cause it's like        

      70 percent alcohol.       

       -Ooh.                    
       -Just be careful.        

That sounds like too many steps 
      for my small brain.       

        I will probably         
      urinate everywhere.       

    Also, I'm very terrible     
    with sexual intercourse.    

           Just fyis.           

          Do you know           
        what that means?        

    Uh, where are you from?     

    That's the saddest thing    
        I've ever heard.        

         It was a, uh,          
          tough time,           

            But, uh,            

           You know,            
        whatever doesn't        
        kill you, right?        

              No.               
            I mean,             

       that is literally        
       the saddest thing        
       I have ever heard.       

          I don't know          
        how you're just         

      Keeping it together       
      like this right now.      

        Yes, last week,         
        David was crying        

        -all day,               
         just everyday.         
        -Tsk, oh.               

 This week DavidÕs only crying  
    a few minutes every day.    

        Yeah,                  

          It's because          
         heÕs so manly.         

           Unlike me,           
         heÕs very good         
         at things like         

        French kissing.         

          Yeah, okay,           
           thank you.           

          Um, you sir,          
        are the greatest        

            best man            
      you could ever want.      

      He's also never done      
         a porno film.          

       But he's received        
          many offers.          

    That's very flattering.     

        Uh, well, Flula,        
     you were the best man.     

    -Did you write a speech?    
    -Yes, I have it here.       

            -You do?            
            -Yeah.              

        That's amazing.         
      You-- you have to--       

      you have to say it.       
  You have to give the speech.  

      -Yeah?                    
      -No, no, no, no, no,      
       no, no, not now.         

   -Yes. Yes.                   
   -How 'bout a little later?   

       -Speech, speech.         
       -No, don't start.        

-DonÕt start.                   
-Speech. Speech. 

 -Guys, no! It's stupid.        
 -Speech. Speech...  

       Yes! Hey!           

        "Hello everyone.        

   What a wonderful location    
   for a wedding like this--    

     this great golf course     
       weÕre on tonight.        

            You guys            
       are all such sexy        
        'motherputters.'        

             Four!"             

             Okay.              

       "David, FrankieÑ        

   David, ladies, gentlemen,    

     and all the attenders      
      of this great event,      

          hello to you          
       and thank you for        
         your presence          

           and also,            
         your presents.         

      Oh, look at that one      
with the nice stripes and bows. 

        Oh, what is it?         
      Perhaps a crock pot?      

        Or a lawn mower?        

      A question for you.       

     Who is a lucky person?     

    Is it a small baby child    
          who is born           

      and can immediately       
           toot horns           

      like a jazz expert?       

   Yes, this is a lucky baby.   

        Or what if a man        
  who cannot speak with words   

   but only with loud screams   
      of agonizing terror?      

       No, he's actually        
           not lucky.           

            But now,            
           let us see           

  who is the most lucky person  
       in all the world.        

   My finger shall tell you.    

           It is me.            

 Because I have the best friend 
      in all of the world.      

             David.             

        -Aw.                    
        -Some years ago,        

      my life as a deejay       
        was, as you say,        

           a complete           
     and 'butter' failure.      

      Everyone in my town       
    was hating at my sound,     

       but then one night       
      everything changed.       

      When an American man      
    made a stop in the bar.     

          He was on a           
       'soul search' trip       
          he did say.           

    We talked for many hours    

         and had many,          
        many schnappses         

        speaking of our         
     frustrations in life.      

      We did hug and dance      
           and, yes,            

  cry some long and hard tears  
        like two pirates        

      searching for booty       
         for many years         

     but finding only dirt      
       and some coconuts.       

         In the morning         
    before David did leave,     
          he told me,           

    âFlula, anytime you are     
 in Los Angeles, look me up.'  

      And so the next day,      
      I purchased a ticket      

       -and flew                
        to Los Angeles.Ó        
       -Yep.                    

    "David was not yet home     
   from his soul search trip,   

  So I did sleep on his porch   
          for 16 days.          

     When he arrived home,      
      he called the police      

        And did pretend         
      not to remember me."      

     Which was very funny,      
       I must say, David.       

   Really, it's this acting.    
 Whoa, you are nail it, right?  

        Man, great work.        
            Talent.             

            Anyway.             

    "After the police left,     
    our friendship sprouted     

       like a fresh field       
         of asparagus.          

    Except unlike asparagus,    

         our friendship         
     did not make our urine     
        smell terrible."        

          And here's--          
    oh, and some nice things    
         about Fankie.         

          Some more--           
    no, it's not applicable.    
            Ah, ja.             

  "David, we have been friends  
     from when we were both     

    at the bottoms of life.     

        And this is when        
  friendships are made strong,  

      like two chandeliers      

        that have fallen        
       inside a volcano.        

     The chandeliers melt,      
 but then they stick together.  

            And then            
      when they cool down,      

   they are hugging forever.    

   Nothing can break this new   
    double chandelier apart.    

    Except if it falls back     
       into the volcano.        

    Or slips into a geyser."    

   I mean, or if you drop it    
      from a large height,      

           then it--            
        i will shatter.        

          But then...           

       "David, I love you       
           very much.           

        Here is to you,         
     my best friend forever     
       and my honeybuddy.       

   So, now let's have a toast   
    For David and FrankieÓÑ    

       nope, just David,        
we are just toasting for David.  

         Cheers, guys,          
           thank you.           

       That was so sweet.       

       -Oh, thanks.             
       -That really was.        

    And, um, I'm just sorry     
    you didn't get to say it    
     at my actual wedding.      

  -Next time.                   
  -YouÕre really good at that.  

         You should be          
       a public speaker.        

        -Oh, no.                
        -Professionally.        

         -No, stop it.          
         -Yeah.                 

       David is the real        
     master thespian here.      

             -OhÉ             
             -Wait.             

            I knew             
      you looked familiar.      

             Uh-uh.             

    -YouÕre a tv star,          
     arenÕt you?                
    -Well, not a tv ãstar.Ó     

        I've-- I've done        
       some stuff on tv.        

   -No big deal.                
   -No, you're, like, famous.   

     You were on that show      
    "Portland steel," right?    

       -Yeah.                   
       -Yeah, I was on          
        "Portland steel."       

        I did that, uh,         
        pilot episode.          

     I was-- the character      
     didnÕt make it, but...     

         -You saw that?         
         -Oh, my god.           

        I was so pissed         
      when they fired you.      

         -Wow.                  
         -I loved you.          

        -You were great.        
        -Thank you.             

	Yeah.            

     So, what else have you     
       been up to lately?       

         I mean, any--          
   anything I would've seen?    

           Uh, well,            

      okay, just some, um,      
  little kind of indy things.   

   -Yeah.                       
   -Did a couple indy dramas.   

    -ThatÕs so cool.            
    -Some got a lot of buzz     
     on the circuit.            

      Do not be so modest.      
   He's done so many things.    

     -Uh, stop it.              
     -"Zombies vs. monkeys,     
      part three."              

-No one saw that movie.         
-I'm not really into sci-fi, so.

        -That was just          
         for a paycheck.        
        -I'm just--             

        I swear there's         
    something else, though.     

     -What?                     
     -No, there's-- I can't     

    -put my finger on it.       
    -ThatÕs pretty much it.     

     -That is everything.       
     -I know there's-- no.      

 Well, there's "Little genius." 
    There's "Little genius."    

    -Oh, my god!        
    -Why would you say that?    

     It's "Little genius."      

          Oh, my god.           

          You are like          
      a national treasure.      

         That is the--          
     like, my favorite show     

      -When I was little.       
      -Yeah?                    

       You were so cute.        

      You used to be like,      
 "But I'm the real boy." right? 

    It had that song, too--     
      How did the song go?      

  -Like, little...              
  -I know that song.   

            -You do?            
            -Yeah.              

   -Yes, you have to play it.   
   -NoÑ hey, no.               

 -We you don't need to do that. 
 -Oh, my god, this is perfect.  

  Please, can we not do that?    

         It's so good.          

      Here's comes the...              

     All right, big finish.      

   -What, he doesn't like it?   
   -ItÕs a really good song.    

      -ItÕs so good, yeah.      
      -ItÕs actually a          
       Really good song.        

     May be bathroom break.     
         I don't know.              

      He doesn't shut up.       

              Ugh!              

   "Dearest Flula, thank you,   

       Or, should I say,        
     danke for last night.      

           Wow, wow.            

        You are a master        
        at making love.         

        You are probably        
     better at making love      
       Than making music.       

       I would've thought       
      that was impossible,      

        Since your music        
   is the best in the world,    

      But, it is possible.      

     I'll never forget you.     

   Also, I'm glad I chose you   
       instead of David.        

        Sincerely yours,        

            Polly."             

         "Ps: DavidÓÉ         

   ..."This is really Flula.    

       I did not have any       
 intimate relations with Polly. 

           That would           
       be inappropriate.        

         Also, you just         
          got punked!"          

  Oh, did I ruin your sounds?   

     You saw my love note.      

    Yeah, it was real funny.    

             What?              

    She was mine last night     
   and that's what I needed.    

        And you came in         
and you cockblocked me so hard. 

           I told you           
 I didn't need a wingman, okay? 

         You don't know         
        when to shut up.        

         Talking about          
        "Little genius"?        

     She liked you because      
      of "Little genius."       

       I brought this up,       
  immediately, she likes you.   

 -They were singing the song--  
 -Enough with "Little genius."  

  -YouÕre telling me            
   Enough of "Little genius"?   
  -Yeah.                        

         That's all you         
      think about, David.       

           I'm trying           
  to bring you here to nature,  
       but where are you?       

      You are stuck inside      
      your cranium there.       

            I'm here            
    to help you feel better     
       here on this trip.       

         And all you do         
  is you're a little bitchier   
  and you're a little moaner.   

 Well, I've had enough moaners  
  and enough bitchers, David.   

      -Suck it up.              
      -Sorry I'm depressed      

   after my fiancÉe left me.    

    But you know what you do    
         all day long?          

   Dude, you have no filter.    

      Did you see the note      
that Frankie left me yesterday? 

     Is that what this joke     
       is all about, man?       

           What note?           
           David, no.           

 You can't just laugh and dance 
    through real life shit.     

    There are repercussions.    
  And you know another thing?   

      -What?                    
      -Remember that night      

     In Germany when we met     

    and had that great time     
 got all drunk off of schnapps? 

           -Yeah.               
           -I don't.            

        I don't remember        
          meeting you.          

      That is the genesis       
  of this relationship, okay?   

      And I don't remember      
    inviting you to America.         

         You know what?         

        I'm going to go         
      to the next campsite      
          without you.          

        Clearly you need        
          to be alone.          

          Okay, yeah,           
      I hope you get there      
         without a map.            

       "Fatigue is high.        

      Bad spirits abound.       

    This is without a doubt     

        the lowest point        
        of our journey."        

         -What is this?         
         -Oh, my god.           

        I can't believe         
    I forget to cancel them.    

    They look like vikings.     

         But friendly.          

           Well, hi.            
       You must be David.       

   -Yes.                        
   -And you must be Frankie.    

      -UhÉ                    
      -WeÕre very pleased       

   to be able to play for you   
   for this special occasion.   

       This is the Organ        
       Renaissance Band,        

    and we have just played     

           a piece by           
    Anthony Holborne called,    
       "The nightwatch."        

          And we have           
   a few more numbers to play   
     for you this evening,      

          and we hope           
   that you enjoy what we've    
     put together for you.      

      Two, three, four...             

             What?              
     The vikings are here?      

           Hey, man,            
    I know I've been a, uh,     

          -Real dick.           
          -Yeah.                

           And I want           
      to apologize to you.      

         Uh, it's okay.         
     I forgive you, David.      

      Don't give it to me       
           that easy.           

     -I...                      
     -ItÕs fine, David,         
      weÕre friends again.      

              Shh.              

      I want to make it up      
            to you,             

        and here's how.         

             Yeah?              
        Remember these?         

        Now, I've never         
       done these before,       

         but I-- okay.          

   I-- I think you have to be   
   in the right headspace...    

         My god, stop.          
      That's way too much.      
        Give that to me.        

              Wow.              

           Go, David.           

              Mm.               

         This do this.          

    -let's do this.             

          Do you think          
   the wolf is gonna eat us?    

    I don't think we should     
     Close our eyes, David.         

       I think I know why       
        Frankie left me.        

       If we make it out        
         of here alive,         

        I'm gonna change        
         my priorities.         

        I'm gonna change        
         my whole life.         

      I dropped your phone      
          on purpose.           

    Oh. Good morning, David.    

           Good news.           

      We did not get eaten      
          last night.           

         Suck it, wolf!           

   Let's go find that lodge.    

            Aw, man,            
         I'm so hungry.         

        Hungry like a--         
       a wolf, actually.               

    "Great joy in the party.    

        We have reached         
   the end of the continent.    

       To my dear friend        
          Meriwether,           

         No man exists          
     with whom I would have     
      preferred to endure       

        such a journey.         

        now let us enjoy        
     this celebrated day."      

          Wow, David.           

         It looks like          
        a robots helmet.        

    Yeah, it's quite modern,    
           isnÕt it?            

      David, are you ready      
      for all the snacks?       

       I'm ready for 'em.       
        give 'em to me.         

     Do you think they have     
      spaghetti bolognese.      

    Oh, they got everything.    

            -Steak?             
            -Yes.               

    -Fries that are french?     
    -Yes.                       

     -Croissants?               
     -Oh, I know                
      they got croissants.      

    -Cabbage?                   
    -No, I don't want those.    

         Well, I'll eat         
         your cabbage.          

           Gentlemen,           
     welcome to big piney.      

  -Thank you.             
  -Saw you coming up the walk.  

     -Is one of you David?      
     -Yeah, that's me.          

   Your agent's been calling    
     quite a bit, and, uh,      

         he wanted you          
       to have this note.       

        Something about         
        Lewis and Clark.        

       Wow, awesome, uh,        
       a quick question.        

   Sir, would it be possible    
         to bring a cot         

       -Into our room?          
       -Yeah, no problem.       

 -WeÕll have one                
  brought up right away.        
 -You hear that, Flula? 

        Nobody's cutting        
   any beds in half tonight.    

        Okay, go on in.         

      Breakfast is ready,       
      hot coffee is ready.      

     -All set for you guys.     
     -Sounds wonderful.         

       Have a great stay.       

Ah, stop and look at me, David. 

      -Is there a problem?      
      -I just remembered.       

     -I'm allergic to cots.     
     -YouÕre not coming?        

       I think we should        
     keep on hiking, David.     

    Come on, this direction     
    looks like a fun place.     

    We're just now learning     
  how to survive wolf attacks.  

   I just want a hot shower.    
          You get it.           

      No, no, you don't--       

    This place looks dirty,     
has very low reviews on "Yelp." 

         Let's go here          
  and hike and hike and hike.   

     I gotta get some food.     

          Hi, Frankie.          

     Oh, look at that fog.      

         It-- it badly          
     needs to be recorded.      

          right away.           

         I texted you,          
    but I never heard back.     

    I was trying to tell you    
          I'd be here.          

          That's what           
        you were trying         
          to tell me?           

             Yeah.              

              Why?              

            Nothing.            

            Just I--            

          I don't know          
      what I was thinking.      

    Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry.    

         I wasn't ready         
        to get married.         

         I-- I just...          

      I wish I had done it      
         a lot earlier.         

  I could've saved both of us   
      a lot of heartache.       

          But I'm glad          
   you went on the honeymoon.   

      You look different.       

      You look like shit,       
           actually,            

      But you look happy.       

       So, how was hiking       
          With Flula?           

      It was interesting.       

         He is a, uh...                   

         Human puzzle.          

       What is he doing?        

    He's a recording a song.    

        And it's either         
    going to be the greatest    
   German work since Wagner,    

      Or it's going to set      
all of humanity back 100 years.       

  It's been quite a honeymoon.  

           How did--            
       did you hike here?       

         -No, I drove.          
         -All the way?          

    -Yeah, took 20 minutes.     
    -Wow. Yeah.                 

       We shoulda drove.        

      What's in the note?       

            Oh, um,             
    this was from my agent.     

           It's about           
  the "Lewis and clark" movie.  

         Remember that?         

         I'm not gonna          
        open it, though.        

  You know, I think I'm gonna   
      start focusing more       

   on what's in front of me.    

           Good luck,           
       David and Frankie.             

          Hey, Flula.           

             -Hey.              
             -Hey.              

      Hey, I just noticed       
      you were taking off,      

    And I just wanted to say    
         this was fun.          

             Yeah,              
     I figured you want to,     

           you know,            
       figure things out        
       with Frankie, so.        

        Yeah, I'm gonna         
    stick back with Frankie.    

         But, hey, man,         
      it was a great trip.      

       It's not finished.       
   I'm-- I'm gonna finish it.   

             So...              

             -Hey.              
             -Yeah.             

            See you.            

             Dude.              

        You really think        
      I'm not gonna finish      
      this trip with you?       

      -What are you, crazy?      
      -David.                   

     I'm a little insulted.     

    Look, the Frankie stuff     
   will figure itself later.    

    -You got me.                
    -Well, I'm pretty good.     

       Now it's my turn.        
     You know this, right?      

       Well, trip's over.       
          weÕre even.           

   -ThatÕs it.                  
   -Okay, David, no problem.    

       -Fingers crossed.           

      You know, you're not      
    actually supposed to say    

       ãfingers crossed"        
         when you lie.          

       Understood, David.       
        Fingers crossed.        

          Hey, did you          
       get enough sounds        
         for your song?         

        Oh, yes, David,         
        itÕs going to be        

       The greatest song        
         of all times.          

          It's called           
     "Honeybuddies forever,     
        Superman never"         

           you know,            
 because of SupermanÕs blatant  

    human rights violations,    
           of course.           

     Do you actually think      
  that Lois Lane and Superman   

         Were the ones          
    who explored this area?     

        What-- does he--        
        what I don't get        

    Is why Superman and Lois    
   Had to take canoes at all.   

           -You know?           
           -UhÉ               

  Couldn't Superman just carry  
        Lois in his arms        

         and fly around         
   these beautiful mountains,   

         And then tell          
      President Traveston       

    and Lex Luthor about it     
       when he got back?        

      Seems logical to me.      

   You are raising questions    
       that I promise you       

           Historians           
       have never asked.        

           Thank you.           

       One last question        
        for you, David.         

            Do you--            
  Do you see that white furry,  
       dog-like creature        

      -Running towards us?                  

        It's 30 meters.         
      No, it's 20 meters.       

           It's like            
       ten meters away...       
           Wait-- ah!           

             Uh...                  

       Honeybuddy, yeah!        

          Yeah! Boom!               

         -Honeybuddies.                 

        Do that again.         

        -No, back, back.        
        -What?                  

          Back-- shh!           
    -- Do that again.     
       No.       

          -What?                
          -Back, back.          

 -What?                         
 -BackÑ shh!-- Do that again.  

        -No, back, back.        
        -What? What?            

  -BackÑ shh! Do that again.                

        No-- back, back.        
        Just go faster.             

        Just go faster.         

             Yeah!              

      -What is happening?       
      -Shh!                     

 "We are now about to penetrate 

           a country            

            on which            
   the foot of civilized man    
        has never trod.         

       It was on the spot       
    where I saw a beautiful     
           white wolf           

          The largest           
       we had ever seen.        

 But this beauty surely allies  
      some unknown danger.      

        I am no coward,         
  but I fear that all will not  

        Make it across          
        this continent."        

   Just go, just go, just go,   
   just go, just go, just go,   

   Just go, just go, just go,   
   just go, just go, just go,   

     -Just go--                 
     -Danger. Danger.     

        -Danger. Danger.                       

        Danger. Danger.         
        Danger. Danger.         

    -Danger. Danger. Danger.    

    Danger. Danger. Danger.     
        Danger. Danger--        

      Honeybuddies, yeah!       

    -Together: honeybuddies.
