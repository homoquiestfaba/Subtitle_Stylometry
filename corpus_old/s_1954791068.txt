           - [sighs]

SO YOU'RE NOT FEELING SO GOOD.
             - NO.

       - WHAT'S GOING ON?

          - I'VE BEEN
   PRETTY DEPRESSED RECENTLY.

           - MM-HMM.

       - KIND OF ANXIOUS.

            JOYLESS.

        - AND HOW ELSE--
      WHAT OTHER SYMPTOMS

      ARE YOU EXPERIENCING
         OF DEPRESSION?

  - JUST NOT SLEEPING TOO MUCH
             AND...

   MY WIFE WORKS A LOT AND...

  I DON'T REALLY LIKE MY JOB.

           - MM-HMM.

            - AND...

      - HAVE YOU TRIED ANY
         OF THE SSRIs?

        ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

           - NO. NO.

    - OKAY, WELL, WE CAN...
   TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR YOU.

  - I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT

   I'M HAVING A PARTICULARLY
      HARD TIME RIGHT NOW.

            - RIGHT.

  YOU'D LIKE A BENZODIAZEPINE

  OR A, YOU KNOW, CLONAZEPAM,
      SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

       WE CAN, YOU KNOW--

  WE CAN HAVE YOU FEELING MUCH
 MORE COMFORTABLE VERY QUICKLY.

       - I GENERALLY TRY
         TO STEER AWAY

     FROM WESTERN MEDICINES
      IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.

    - DO YOU HAVE A HISTORY
          OF ADDICTION

  OR ALCOHOLISM IN YOUR PAST?

             - NO.
       - YOU'LL BE FINE.

    - BUT ARE THERE ORGANIC
         ALTERNATIVES?

     - I'M NOT REALLY SURE
   WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

      - WELL, IN YOUR AD,
IT SAID THAT YOU COULD PRESCRIBE

       MEDICAL MARIJUANA
      IN CASES OF ANXIETY.

            - SURE.

      - IS THAT SOMETHING
      THAT'S A POSSIBILITY

    THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE
         GOOD FOR ME...

        IN MY SITUATION?

            - SURE.

         WOULD YOU LIKE
       MEDICAL MARIJUANA?

THAT'S PROBABLY A GREAT IDEA.

      [light guitar music]

              Â¶ Â¶

 - Â¶ YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

   Â¶ I'M EVERYTHING TO YOU Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

      Â¶ WE'RE EVERYTHING Â¶

    Â¶ THAT COULD EVER MEAN Â¶

          Â¶ ANYTHING Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

             - HEY.
          - WHAT'S UP?

            - FILES.
             - OH.

            - YEAH.
          - THANK YOU.

     - JUST MAKE SURE THAT
   WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH 'EM,

  LIKE, JUST PAPER CLIP THEM.

       DON'T USE STAPLES.
     JUST PAPER CLIP THEM.

        BUT DON'T, LIKE,
      MESS UP THE PAPERS.

    LIKE, LAST TIME, YOU PUT
THE HAMMY'S IN THE BURGER PLACE,

AND THEN I HAD TO REDO IT, SO--

            - OKAY.

 - Â¶ YOU'RE THE SHOOTING STAR Â¶

   Â¶ IN EVERY WAYWARD NIGHT Â¶

  Â¶ FOR YOU, MY TURTLE DOVE Â¶

Â¶ TAKE ONLY THRONES TO FLIGHT Â¶

Â¶ FOR ALL THE TIMES WE'LL KNOW Â¶

     Â¶ AND ALL THOSE PLACES
          I WILL GO Â¶

     Â¶ YOU'RE STILL ALONE Â¶

             - HEY.
             - HEY.

YOU KNOW, THAT SPORTING GOODS
        THING IS A MESS.

  - I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE THAT,
           AREN'T I?

 I GOT TO DEAL WITH THE HAMMY'S
  AND THE BURGER PLACE STUFF,

 AND I GOT TO FINISH THIS ONE,
AND THEN I'LL GET RIGHT ON THE--

          - ALL RIGHT.
             OKAY.

          HOW'S THAT?

       - FUCKING BRUTAL.
           - I KNOW.

   - Â¶ I'M THE WISHING WELL Â¶

   Â¶ YOU COME TO EVERY DAY Â¶

 Â¶ CLIMB INSIDE THESE SHEETS Â¶

     Â¶ AND NEVER GO AWAY Â¶

Â¶ FOR ALL THE TIMES WE'LL KNOW Â¶

     Â¶ AND ALL THOSE PLACES
          LEFT TO GO Â¶

      Â¶ I'M STILL ALONE Â¶

        - HOW YOU DOING?

       - HEY. WHAT'S UP?

    - YOU LIKE WORKING HERE?

          - UM, YEAH.

      - YOU TELL EVERYBODY
       I'M AN OLD PRICK?

     YOU DON'T LIKE WORKING
      FOR THAT OLD PRICK?

    - I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY
  THAT YOU WERE AN OLD PRICK.

      - YOU SAID YOU DON'T
LIKE WORKING FOR THE OLD PRICK.

 HOW MANY OLD PRICKS WORK HERE?

      - WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

      - IF YOU DON'T WANT
        TO WORK FOR ME,

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

    YOU'RE NOT DOING A FAVOR
FOR WORKING FOR THE "OLD PRICK."

         - OKAY. OKAY.
          - WATCH IT.

              Â¶ Â¶

   - I'M SO GLAD WE DID THIS.

        - YEAH, ME TOO.
           IT'S NICE.

  WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
          FOR A WHILE.

      THEY'RE HAVING FUN.
            - YEAH.

     XANA IS SO CUTE, MAN.
       CONGRATS ON THAT.

           - THANKS.

    - IS SHE SLEEPING OKAY?

          - YOU KNOW.
         - YEAH. YEAH.

           - [laughs]
            - I DO.

 - I'M TELLING YOU, YOU SHOULD
REALLY CHECK OUT THIS STROLLER.

           - MM-HMM.

          - YOU KNOW,
   SAY YOU GUYS ARE IN EUROPE

  AND YOU WANT TO GO SHOPPING,

  SO YOU PUT IN THIS ONE SEAT,
          AND YOU GO.

       DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DO.
           YOU KNOW.

 AND THEN IT'S TIME FOR DINNER.
  AND THEN IT'S TIME FOR BED.

  AND YOU POP IN THE BASSINET.

      IT DOES EVERYTHING.
       - HOW MUCH IS IT?

   - IT'S, LIKE, 1,400 BUCKS.
           - OH. HMM.

           - I KNOW.
  - COULD BUY A BOAT FOR THAT.

     - A REALLY SMALL BOAT.

   - WELL, I MEAN, I'D RATHER
  HAVE A STROLLER THAN A BOAT.

   - SO HOW ARE THINGS WITH--
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO EXACTLY?

       - I'M A MUSICIAN.
          - RIGHT ON.

          - TANK AND I
      ACTUALLY HAVE A BAND

THAT WE'VE HAD SINCE WE WERE 19.

           - NO WAY.

    CAN I COME SEE YOU PLAY
     SOMETIME AROUND HERE?

  YOU GOT GIGS COMING UP SOON?

          - NOTHING IN
     THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.

           RIGHT NOW
      WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED

          ON RECORDING
     AND WRITING NEW SONGS.

     - RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.

        - WE SHOULD EAT.
          - RIGHT ON.

           [laughter]

          - CHEERS TO
     A FANTASTIC BARBEQUE.

            - YEAH.
            - YEAH.

           - YOU WANT
    TO HEAR SOMETHING COOL?

            - SURE.
THIS GUY ACTUALLY MARRIED US.

           - NO WAY.
       - GET OUT OF HERE.

           - I KNOW.

 - YEAH, I GOT ORDAINED ONLINE.

         - OH, MY GOD.

         WHAT DID WE DO
  BEFORE THE INTERNET, RIGHT?

            - RIGHT.

        - BABY MONITOR.
             VINO.

        [static hissing]

       OH, JESUS CHRIST.

           OH, FUCK.

            FOR YOU.
             - WOW.

       - AGGRESSIVE POUR.

           [laughter]

 - SWEETIE, DINNER WAS AWESOME.

          - THANK YOU.
           - IT WAS.

    - WERE THOSE TOFU DOGS?
          - TOFU DOGS.

           - MM-HMM.

       - ALL RIGHT, COOL.
I, UM...I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

    YOU GUYS KNOW HOW I EAT,
           OBVIOUSLY.

  AND THAT'S ALSO HOW I THINK.

I HAVE A VERY HOLISTIC ATTITUDE.

       AND I'M CURRENTLY
      STARTING A BUSINESS.

         THE COMPANY'S
      CALLED "FACE FOOD."

    IT'S FOOD FOR YOUR FACE.

       IT'S 100% ORGANIC
  AND WILD-HARVESTED AND RAW.

   BASICALLY, THE BELIEF IS,

 YOUR SKIN IS THE LARGEST ORGAN
         IN YOUR BODY,

      AND IT ABSORBS MORE
        THAN YOUR MOUTH,

 SO WHY FEED IT TOXIC CHEMICALS
WHEN YOU CAN FEED IT FACE FOOD,

  A TOTALLY HOLISTIC SKIN CARE
LINE THAT YOU CAN LITERALLY EAT?

 FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO BOLD,

    BUT I KNOW THAT YOU BOTH
   ARE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL,

AS I CAN SEE FROM YOUR BEAUTIFUL
       CHILDREN AS WELL.

      I'M LOOKING FOR 100K
       AS AN INVESTMENT.

         - TANK. TANK.

   GUYS, THIS IS SO AWKWARD.
         - NO. NO. NO.

HE'S ASKING YOU FOR $100,000.

           - NO. NO.
       - LET THEM SPEAK.

    - LOOK, WE GET IT A LOT.
     IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

      - THANK YOU. LISTEN.

     YOU GUYS CAN TAKE THAT
      AND READ THAT OVER.

LITERALLY, I JUST WROTE THIS ON
THE WAY OVER HERE, BUT I HAVE--

       - SURE, MAN. SURE.

          DEFINITELY.
       WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

             SURE.
            - YEAH.

       [nervous laughter]

            - SHIT.

            - UM...

             OKAY.

I WAS LIKE, "AM I GONNA DO THIS?
    AM I NOT GONNA DO THIS?

           YES? NO?"
           YES. OKAY.

 ONE OF MY PROFESSORS AT SCHOOL
   RECOMMENDED ME FOR A JOB.

       - ARE YOU SERIOUS?
             - YAY.

     - RIGHT ON. CONGRATS.
       - THAT'S AWESOME.

            - YEAH.
            - NICE.

 - MY FINAL WRITING REQUIREMENT
   WAS CHOSEN TO BE PUBLISHED

    IN A KIND OF PRESTIGIOUS
      HEALTH LAW JOURNAL.

      IT WAS LEGAL ISSUES
       RELATING TO AIDS,

  AND HE GAVE IT TO THE POLICY
 AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS STAFF

        OVER AT MASSER.

      THEY KNOW THEY HAVE
    A STRANGE PUBLIC IMAGE,

    SO THEY WANT TO GET MORE
    AIDS RESEARCH DOLLARS--

  - WAIT, MASSER DRUG COMPANY?

   - YEAH, BUT THE THING IS--

     - BABY, WHEN WERE YOU
         GONNA TELL ME?

     - I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

    LOOK, I WASN'T SURE WHEN
    THE RIGHT OCCASION WAS,

  AND IT HAPPENED VERY FAST--

   - WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

    CLOVER, SO YOU'RE GOING
      TO WORK FOR MASSER?

     MASSER HAS NO INTEREST
        IN CURING AIDS.

       THEY WANT TO KEEP
 PUSHING THEIR DRUGS ON PEOPLE.

       THIS IS BLOWING ME
    THE FUCK AWAY RIGHT NOW.

    - THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.

        - NO, IT'S NOT.

  - YEAH, IT'S REALLY STRANGE
 FOR YOU TO BE TELLING<i> US</i> THIS,

        DON'T YOU THINK?

   - NO, BECAUSE I JUST WENT
    FOR MY SECOND INTERVIEW

    WHERE THEY TALKED TO ME
   ABOUT IT, AND I WAS LIKE,

  "OH, I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM."

      - DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT
     THAT FIRST INTERVIEW.

     - WE'RE TALKING 401K,
        LIFE INSURANCE,

   THE BEST MEDICAL BENEFITS
      THAT MONEY CAN BUY.

      - RIGHT. YEAH. COOL.

 SELL YOUR SOUL FOR SOME MONEY.

SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE GREAT.
           - I AGREE.

      I THINK IT'S GREAT.
         RIGHT, HONEY?

        - YEAH, I THINK
       IT'S REALLY GREAT.

            - YEAH.
          - THANK YOU.

     - THIS IS SO STRANGE.

       IF YOU KNEW HER...

   IF YOU KNEW HER, YOU WOULD
UNDERSTAND HOW STRANGE THIS IS.

        [alarm beeping]

        - UH, REMEMBER,
 WE NEED ORGANIC BABY DIAPERS.

           - [sighs]

        HOW ABOUT THAT?

   HOW ABOUT THAT, ROCK STAR?

       [knocking on door]

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT, KID?

           EAST L.A.

        ECHO PARK. HEY.

            - HELLO.

       - HELLO, ALLISON.
          - HI, HONEY.

   - HOW YOU DOING, DARLIN'?

          - [fussing]

      - I'M GONNA PASS HER
          OVER TO YOU.

     I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

           - [crying]

         - BABY CAKES.
  - THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

        [phone ringing]

            - HELLO.

   - HI, RADKO, IT'S LONNIE.

         - WHAT ARE YOU
       CALLING ABOUT NOW?

  - I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE
   ABLE TO MAKE IT IN TODAY.

     - OH, GOD. NOT AGAIN.
           NOT AGAIN.

              WHY?
   WHY YOU CAN'T COME TODAY?

              WHY?

        - I'VE GOT SOME
     FAMILY STUFF GOING ON

THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE CARE
 OF, BUT I WILL BE IN TOMORROW.

    - WHAT THE FUCK'S WRONG
       WITH YOUR DISEASE?

         WHAT'S WRONG?
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAMILY?

   - RADKO, PLEASE JUST STOP
         YELLING AT ME.

  - YOU'RE TORMENTING MY ASS!
   THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

I JUST--REMEMBER MY DAUGHTER?
       - SHE WORKS HERE?

    THEN I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
      ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER!

        - SHE'S FEELING
       REALLY ILL TODAY,

   AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE HER
       INTO THE HOSPITAL.

  - ARE YOU FUCKING DEAF NOW?

   YOU HAVE WAX UP YOUR ASS?

    - OKAY, JUST LET ME TALK
         FOR A SECOND.

  I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER.
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

  I WILL BE THERE FIRST THING
       TOMORROW MORNING.

    - OH. COME IN TOMORROW.
           TOMORROW!

    AND DON'T TELL ME ABOUT
         YOUR DAUGHTER.

      I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
      ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

            - OKAY.

  - OKAY, LOOK, I'D BETTER GO.
       I HAVE WORK TO DO.

      - THANK YOU, RADKO.

 THESE HASH BROWNS ARE AMAZING.

 - YOU KNOW A THREE-LETTER WORD
        FOR "DISTANCE,"

      STARTS WITH AN "F"?

            - "FAR"?

            [grunts]

       [knocking on door]

            YO. OH.
       - WHAT'S UP, MAN?

       - WHAT YOU DOING?

          - RELAXING.
          - RIGHT ON.

      - I THOUGHT WE WERE
   GETTING TOGETHER THURSDAY.

 - OH, YEAH, NO, WE WERE, BUT--

   SHIT, THE FUNNIEST THING.

     I WENT INTO WORK TODAY
      AND STARTED WORKING,

   AND THE T1 LINE WENT DOWN.

   WE'RE, LIKE, A, YOU KNOW--

     WE'RE, LIKE, A FUCKING
    RENDER FARM OVER THERE.

THE T1 LINE GOES DOWN, AND THEN
  WE CAN'T SEND ANYTHING OUT,

 AND, YOU KNOW, WORK JUST KIND
   OF GRINDS TO A STANDSTILL,

         SO RADKO SAID,
    "YOU GUYS CAN GO," SO--

  - SO WHAT DO YOU WANT, MAN?

  - I JUST HAD SOME FREE TIME.

        I THOUGHT MAYBE
     WE COULD RECORD TODAY.

            - OKAY.
            - YEAH?

       - YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
        COME ON, BUDDY.

   [upbeat rock rhythm track]

              Â¶ Â¶

      YOU FEEL IT, RIGHT?

   - WE COULD ABSOLUTELY LAY
   SOMETHING DOWN OVER THIS.

CAN I EAT SOME OF THE FACE FOOD,
   OR DO YOU NEED THE FOOD--

        - IT IS EDIBLE.

    IT'S 100% EDIBLE, BUT I
 UNFORTUNATELY NEED ALL OF IT,

        THOUGH, BUT I--

   - LIKE, JUST--COULD I HAVE
        HALF AN AVOCADO?

           - NO, MAN.
     I NEED THOSE ACTUALLY.

           I'M SORRY.

       - TANK, ARE THOSE
       GIRLS' UNDERWEAR?

              Â¶ Â¶

            - WHERE?

      - DUDE, RIGHT THERE
        UNDER THE SEAT.

        - LOOKS LIKE IT.
            I--YEAH.

        THAT'S BIZARRE.
            - TANK.

   - THAT'S TOTALLY BIZARRE.

 - WHY ARE YOU BEING BULLSHIT?
   - I'M NOT BEING BULLSHIT.

      - DON'T BE BULLSHIT.
             - NO.

  IT TOTALLY SEEMED BULLSHIT.
 THAT IS FUCKING WEIRD, THOUGH.

            - OKAY.

    THERE'S SOME EXPLANATION
        FOR WHY YOU HAVE

GIRLS' UNDERWEAR ON YOUR FLOOR.

    - WELL, THERE HAS TO BE,
     'CAUSE THEY'RE THERE,

   BUT I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW
      WHY THEY ARE THERE,

 WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT WEIRD.

              Â¶ Â¶

CHECK, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
 CHECK, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

          LITTLE MORE.

    [music volume increases]

         ONE. ONE. ONE.

            Â¶ ONE Â¶

       YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
        ALL RIGHT. COOL.

              Â¶ Â¶

          - [humming]

         GOD DAMN, MAN.
 - DUDE, THAT WAS FUCKING SICK.

          - BRILLIANT.

  - OH, I WISH I COULD DO THAT
           EVERY DAY.

              AH.

     ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

  NEED TO GO BACK TO REALITY.

            - BUDDY.
            - YEAH?

 - I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY.

           - UH-HUH.

     - THERE'S A YOUNG MAN
    WALKING ACROSS A FIELD,

  AND HE RUNS INTO AN OLD MAN

         WHO'S PLANTING
      AN APRICOT SEEDLING.

    AND HE ASKS THE OLD MAN,

     "WHY ARE YOU PLANTING
       SUCH A NEW TREE?"

     AND THE OLD MAN SAYS,

    "BECAUSE I LIVE EACH DAY
  AS THOUGH I WILL NEVER DIE."

     AND THE YOUNG MAN SAYS
        TO THE OLD MAN,

      "WELL, THAT'S FUNNY,
    BECAUSE I LIVE EACH DAY

"AS THOUGH I WILL DIE TOMORROW.

   WHICH ONE OF US IS RIGHT?"

     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

     - THINK ABOUT IT, BRO.

       - CATCH YOU, MAN.

       - YOU DRIVE SAFE.

  - THIS WASN'T ON THE FLOOR--

  [both speaking indistinctly]

         - WAIT. WAIT.

          [both cheer]

   - GUESS I GOT COMPETITION.

          - GET KIWI.

        - YOU'RE A KIWI.

          - ALL RIGHT.
    WE'RE HOME, LITTLE BABY.

            [sighs]

          - HEY, BABY.
             - HI.

          - HEY, BABY.

              MMM.

         - WHAT YOU GOT
      GOING ON OVER HERE?

           - DINNER.

      I COOKED MOST OF IT.

         I JUST FIGURED
     WE COULD USE A MINUTE

   TO PUSH THE RESET BUTTON.

     - THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

    - I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

   GO PUT YOUR SWEATPANTS ON,
    AND I WILL PUT HER DOWN,

   AND WE WILL RECONVENE HERE
          MOMENTARILY.

           COME HERE.

    OH, COME HERE, MONSTER.

       COME HERE, MONKEY.

          - THANK YOU.
       - YOU'RE WELCOME.

  YOU WANT SOME MANGO CHUTNEY?

           [laughter]

        GET IT IN THERE.

    - WHAT IF IT CHOKES ME?
     - TAKE YOUR HAND DOWN.

           [laughter]

            COME ON.

       FUCKING HIGH FIVE.
         - OH, MY GOD.

      YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

   - WE SHOULD TAKE THAT SHIT
          ON THE ROAD.

       MAKE US SOME MONEY
       LIKE TED AND MARY.

    - THEY ARE FILTHY RICH.

THEY SPENT $1,400 ON A STROLLER.
          - BULLSHIT.

      HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED
       A STROLLER TO DO,

 BECAUSE IN THE TERM ITSELF...

          - STROLLING.

 - IT'S JUST STROLLING, RIGHT?

           - EXACTLY.

     - BUT I DID HAVE QUITE
  A SCINTILLATING CONVERSATION

   WITH TED ABOUT THE TRIALS
        AND TRIBULATIONS

    OF COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER.

OH, WELL, THAT IS FASCINATING.
        WHAT DID HE SAY?

WELL, EVIDENTLY HE'S VERY BIG
        IN THE BUSINESS.

           I THINK--
     - WAIT, IS HE REALLY?

        CAN'T YOU TELL?

     WASN'T THERE SOMETHING
        ABOUT HIS VOICE

  THAT WAS A LITTLE PAVLOVIAN?

  IT WAS LIKE HE WAS SPEAKING
    AND HE WAS TALKING TO US

  AND HE WAS TELLING STORIES,
     AND HE WAS A NICE GUY,

       BUT ALL THE TIME,
  YOU WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING.

           - TOTALLY.

  I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST TRYING
  TO BE, LIKE, A DUDE'S DUDE,

LIKE MAYBE HE'D BEEN HANGING OUT
 WITH ALL THOSE GIRLS TOO MUCH,

  LIKE HIS LITTLE GIRLS AND--

NO, HE REALLY TALKS LIKE THAT,
          AND THAT'S--

  I MEAN, THAT'S HOW THEY HAVE
        THE RANGE ROVER.

      THAT'S HOW THEY HAVE
          THE PORSCHE.

       - THAT'S WHY THEY
       CAN GO TO EUROPE.

          - THAT'S WHY
    THEY ARE ABLE TO PURSUE

  THE BOURGEOIS AMERICAN DREAM

   THAT WE ARE JUST A LITTLE
     ARM'S REACH AWAY FROM.

     - FOLLOW YOUR PASSION,
          YOUR DREAMS.

         GO TO EUROPE.

      FOLLOW YOUR PASSION
        AND YOUR DREAMS.

         GO TO EUROPE.

 - WELL, BUT HERE'S THE THING,
 WHICH I THINK IS KIND OF SAD,

    HIS DAY JOB HAS BECOME,

           YOU KNOW,
    HIS ABSOLUTE LIVELIHOOD.

           - MM-HMM.

   - AND I THINK THAT'S WHY--
     I WAS TALKING TO HIM,

   AND I REALIZED THAT'S WHY
    IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ME

      TO KEEP THE DAY JOB
   AND, YOU KNOW, THE DREAM,

  THE PASSION, THE MUSIC KIND
  OF SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER.

     - OH, I KNOW, SWEETIE.

    YOU'VE GOT A SWEET LOOK
         ON YOUR FACE.

         - NO, I JUST--

      WE RECORDED A SONG.

     - YOU RECORDED A SONG?

   - YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

     WE ALWAYS FUCK AROUND
         A LITTLE BIT,

BUT WE ACTUALLY RECORDED, LIKE,
          A SONG-SONG.

     - IT HAS BEEN FOREVER.

           - I KNOW.

       AND IT'S NOT DONE.

WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND RE-TRACK
    SOME OF THE VOCAL STUFF,

   BUT, I MEAN, IT'S, LIKE--

 WE GOT DRUMS, AND WE GOT BASS,

    AND WE GOT A TAMBOURINE,
          AND, LIKE--

   AND TANK'S PLAYING GUITAR,
        AND I'M SINGING,

AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF GREAT.

       - THAT'S AWESOME.

   - DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

            - YEAH.

        - ARE YOU SURE?

 - OF COURSE I WANT TO HEAR IT.

            - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.

       - LIKE ART MUSIC?

       - LIKE MUSIC ART.

    WE COULD DO A SHOW MAYBE
WHERE MY BAND WAS PLAYING MUSIC

     AND YOU WERE JUST OFF
     TO THE SIDE PAINTING,

      BUT YOU GOT INSPIRED
    BY WHAT WE WERE PLAYING,

     AND SO YOUR PAINTINGS
   WOULD REPRESENT THE MUSIC,

     BUT THEN I COULD LOOK
        AT THE PAINTINGS

 WHILE I WAS SINGING AND, LIKE,

    MAYBE COME UP WITH SONGS
          ON THE SPOT,

     AND I COULD SING THOSE
   INSPIRED BY YOUR PAINTING,

     SO IT WOULD BE KIND OF
        FEEDING ITSELF,

JUST A PINWHEEL OF INSPIRATION.

             - WOW.

       YEAH, WE SHOULD--
       WE SHOULD DO THAT.

    LIKE, SOMEWHERE TO PLAY,
         AND, I MEAN--

         OF THE STREET.

     - I DON'T REALLY HAVE
          A FULL BAND.

   I JUST HAVE ONE OTHER GUY
     THAT I'M PLAYING WITH,

  SO I WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOME
OTHER MUSICIANS TO PLAY WITH US.

            - OKAY.

      - I'M ACTUALLY GOING

      - YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

 - WHAT YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T GO?

      - I MEAN, I DIDN'T--
       I SAID, "FUCK IT."

          I DIDN'T GO.

             WHOO.

        BECAUSE I CAN'T.

  - WHY CAN'T YOU GO TO WORK?

  - YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE I JUST
  REACHED MY MAXIMUM CAPACITY

  FOR PRETENDING LIKE I CARED.

         AND I GO HOME,
    AND CLOVER'S ALL WEIRD,

        AND SHE'S, LIKE,
HALF A STEP AWAY FROM A PANTSUIT

AT THIS POINT, AND SHE'S TAKING
      THIS JOB FOR MASSER.

      THIS ISN'T THE LIFE
        THAT WE WANTED.

    - OKAY, SO WHAT ARE YOU
       GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

       - WHAT DO YOU MEAN
  WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

       LET'S GO HANG OUT.

         - GO HANG OUT?

   - SHIT, LET'S GO ON TOUR.

 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
              MAN?

        YOU'RE A FATHER.

YOU NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
       FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

     - BROTHER, I LOVE YOU,

    BUT WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU
 TO TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY?

    YOU LIVE IN A WINNEBAGO
         ON THE BEACH.

YEAH, AND I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE?

       I CHOSE THIS LIFE

    BECAUSE I WANTED TO LIVE
       A LIFE OF FREEDOM.

     YOU MADE YOUR CHOICES.

       YOU HAVE A FAMILY.
        YOU HAVE A WIFE.

YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL,

        AND IF YOU WANT
      YOUR LIFE TO CHANGE,

     YOU NEED TO BE HONEST
  WITH YOURSELF AND YOUR WIFE.

  YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING AWAY
        FROM SHIT, MAN.

           - MM-HMM.

      YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

         - YEAH, I AM.

            - YEAH.

      I'LL CATCH YOU SOON.

    I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

        THAT I LIKE YOU

          A WHOLE LOT.

      I LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

     AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO
    IF YOU WERE REALLY DEAD.

          - [fussing]

            - YEAH.

        I KNOW. I KNOW.

             - WOW.

  IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE.

      LOOK AT THOSE EYES.

      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

 HONEY, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

      - YEAH, SHE STARTED
     DOING THAT LAST WEEK.

          - SERIOUSLY?

          - SERIOUSLY.

     - [cooing over radio]

    - I WAS WILLING TO LIVE
 IN THAT TOMATO PATCH FOREVER.

          YOU BAILED.

   - WE SPENT 36 HOURS THERE.

           - OH, MAN.
   - WE WERE SO FUCKING HIGH.

  - HOW WAS IT SO COMFORTABLE
        TO SLEEP THERE?

          - IT WASN'T.
       WE WERE JUST HIGH.

             - OH.

    I FEEL LIKE, DEEP DOWN,

  WE WERE SO COMFORTABLE THERE

     'CAUSE THAT WAS WHERE
     WE WERE MEANT TO LIVE.

            - FUCK,
   THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

      - AND WE HAVE FUCKED
   EVERYTHING ELSE UP SINCE.

             - NO.

           - [sighs]

    SHOULD I TAKE THIS JOB?

    - ARE YOU REALLY ASKING?

            - YEAH.

      - YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

 - IS IT THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

       - I WAS PISSED OFF
   WITH THE WAY YOU TOLD ME,

   BUT YOU MADE A GOOD CASE.

    FUCK, YOU GET IN THERE,
   YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PROBABLY

       DO A LOT MORE GOOD
   THAN YOU WOULD ELSEWHERE.

    YOU'LL HAVE A TREMENDOUS
      AMOUNT OF RESOURCES,

AND IT WILL HELP OUR FAMILY OUT.

         - I JUST HAVE
     THIS PERFECT VISION...

        YOU KNOW, OF US,

          THAT THING.

            [sighs]

   I JUST DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH
     TO GET ANYTHING DONE.

    - I MEAN, WE WERE KIDS.

  I DON'T KNOW THAT, WITH HER,
 WE'VE GOT THAT LUXURY ANYMORE.

           - I KNOW.

             AND...

        IT'S TIME FOR ME
   TO TAKE OVER A LITTLE BIT

   AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT US.

     YOU HAVE BEEN CARRYING
THE HEAVY LOAD FOR A LONG TIME.

            - UM...

I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

     AFTER WE HAD OUR FIGHT
       THE OTHER NIGHT...

           - MM-HMM.

    - I GOT REALLY CONFUSED.

           - MM-HMM.

       - AND SO I STARTED
       THINKING ABOUT...

             UM...

 I STARTED THINKING ABOUT MAYBE
  MAKING A CAREER CHANGE TOO.

           - MM-HMM.

        - LIKE, I FIGURE
       MOST OF MY FRIENDS

WHO ARE MAKING SERIOUS BANK ARE
DOING IT IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY,

     AND I THOUGHT MAYBE--

           - GAMING?

         ONLINE GAMING.

DO YOU EVEN PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

         - I DON'T KNOW
   THAT THAT'S THE SOLUTION.

 I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT.

 I SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE.

         - VIDEO GAMES?

         - I LOVE YOU.
         - I LOVE YOU.

 EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY HAS
 DONE HAS JUST BEEN TOO SWEET.

      - IT'S NEVER ENOUGH,
    AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND.

    THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS--

WE WENT CAMPING THIS WEEKEND.
    - YEAH? WHERE'D YOU GO?

    - IT WAS JUST UP NORTH.
        OH, IT WAS NICE.

YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, TO GET OUT
    OF THIS CONCRETE JUNGLE,

        OUT OF THE CAR,
   AND OUT INTO MOTHER NATURE

  IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
      FOR A CHILD, REALLY.

      - YOU KNOW, I THINK
  THAT'S THE MOST QUALITY TIME

     I'VE SPENT WITH XANA.

            - YEAH.

       - I DIDN'T REALIZE
       I WAS MISSING IT.

         [lock turning]

      - THERE WE GO, BABY.

          - HI, BABY.
          - HI, DEAR.

        - HOW YOU DOING?

           HI, XANA.

 OH, LET ME TAKE HER FROM YOU.

              OH.
              HEY.

       HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

      - IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

             UM...

    DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE GO
  GET SOME PIZZA OR SOMETHING?

            - YEAH.

    LET ME GET OUT OF THIS.

            - OKAY.

            [sighs]

        AH, LITTLE GIRL.

         HEY, COME ON.
            COME ON.

     IT'S BETTER OUT HERE.

     IT'S BETTER OUT HERE.

        [phone ringing]

            - HELLO?

         HEY, JEANNIE.
         HOW YOU DOING?

        NO, XANA'S FINE.

    SHE'S OUT THERE PLAYING
         WITH HER DAD.

              OH.

     I MEAN, SHE COULD USE
         A FRESH DIAPER

      JUDGING BY THE SMELL
         OF HER, BUT--

OH, OH, I THINK THAT'S FOR ME.

    BABY, GIVE ME THE PHONE.

             - AH.

      THANK YOU, JEANNIE.

        - WHO WAS THAT?

        [laughing] WHAT?

             WHAT?

    OH, DUDE, I KNOW EXACTLY

    WHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
       LIKE THAT, WHICH--

 OBVIOUSLY, I WOULD LOOK AT ME
 LIKE THAT TOO, BUT IT'S NOT--

          IT'S THAT--

DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU,
      LIKE, SIX WEEKS AGO

   THAT TONY LOVETT, THE GUY
  FROM SFX, HE'D LOST HIS SON?

     DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

             OKAY.

  WELL, TONY LOST HIS TODDLER,

  AND WE TOOK UP A COLLECTION,
    AND I GAVE HIM 50 BUCKS.

       I KNOW I PROBABLY
  SHOULDN'T HAVE, BUT I JUST--

   I WAS THINKING ABOUT XANA,
 AND I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,

     IF IT HAPPENED TO US,
         JESUS CHRIST,

  SO MY NAME WAS ON THIS LOG,

 AND THERE WAS A SEPARATE KIND
   OF DONATION SHEET FOR HIM,

     AND JEANNIE SAW THAT,

   AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT
  SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO US

          AND TO XANA,

        AND THAT'S WHY--

  THAT WAS WHEN SHE CAME OVER
        WITH THE QUICHE.

   SHE THOUGHT THAT WHERE WAS

   THIS WHOLE OTHER SITUATION
      WHICH NEVER EXISTED.

             WHAT?

     I'M EXPLAINING TO YOU
         WHAT HAPPENED.

       I'M TELLING YOU--

         YOU DON'T BE--

      - WHERE'S THE MONEY?

       WHERE'S THE MONEY?

            GET OUT.

          [door opens]

         [door closes]

            - UM...

          - SIT DOWN.

        WHAT DID YOU DO?

       - DOES IT MATTER?

             - YES.

             - I...

     I WOKE UP THE MORNING

    AFTER WE HAD OUR FIGHT,

      AND I DROVE TO WORK,

        AND I LITERALLY
  COULDN'T MAKE MYSELF GO IN.

    I JUST COULDN'T BREATHE.

      AND I TURNED AROUND,
   AND I GOT BACK IN MY CAR,

     AND I CALLED MY BOSS,
AND I TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS SICK

       AND THAT I NEEDED
  THE DAY TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

  BECAUSE THAT SEEMED LIKE...

       - THAT'S OUR BABY.
       - I KNOW. I KNOW.

    I HAD A REALLY GOOD DAY,

     AND THEN I CAME HOME,

 AND, LIKE, I HAD TIME TO COOK,
  AND THEN WE HAD A FUN TIME,

  AND FOR A SECOND, LIKE, FOR
A SPLIT FUCKING SECOND THAT DAY,

          I FELT KIND
     OF LIKE MYSELF AGAIN,

      AND I LOOKED AT YOU,

     AND YOU LOOKED KIND OF
        LIKE YOU AGAIN,

 AND I FELT LIKE, "OKAY, OKAY,
      MAYBE I CAN DO THIS.

       MAYBE ALL I NEEDED
     WAS JUST THAT BREAK."

  AND I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY,
       AND I WENT, AND...

        AND I COULDN'T--

    I JUST COULDN'T GO BACK.

        I JUST COULDN'T.
       IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

           AND SO...

           - LONNIE.

            - SO...

    I CALLED MY BOSS, AND...

        AND I PANICKED.

           IT, LIKE,
    HAPPENED IN A BLACKOUT.

          I PANICKED,
     AND I SAID THAT SHE--

      THAT XANA HAD DIED.

    AND I WANTED TO TAKE IT
   ALL BACK, BUT I COULDN'T.

    I COULDN'T TAKE IT BACK.

      I COULDN'T TAKE BACK
         WHAT I'D DONE.

           - LONNIE.

        - AND I'M NOT--

  I'M NOT PUTTING THIS ON YOU
            AT ALL,

            AT ALL.

 BECAUSE I'M THE ASSHOLE HERE.

    BUT YOU'VE MADE CHOICES
    THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

   AND I FEEL LIKE I'M STUCK.

  I'M STUCK IN SOME FUCKING...

         COLLEGE DREAM

   BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT OR--

    I JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME,
     AND I'M NOT BITCHING.

   IT'S WHAT A MAN SHOULD DO.

   IT'S WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE,
    IS BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE

   OF HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILD,

  AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE
    ABLE TO DO FOR YOU GUYS.

       I WANT TO BE ABLE
       TO DO THAT SO BAD,

    BUT, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
   WHAT I CARE ABOUT ANYMORE.

        MY MUSIC SUCKS.

            - YEAH.
       YOUR MUSIC SUCKS.

            - OUCH.

        - YOU KNOW WHAT?

         WHAT I'M DOING
     SUCKS PRETTY BAD TOO.

    I'M NOT PROUD OF MYSELF.

I'M NOT PROUD OF MYSELF ANYMORE.

      I'M NOT PROUD OF ME,
   AND I'M NOT PROUD OF YOU.

            - YEAH.

  - I WANT TO BE PROUD OF US.

        - WE'RE ALLOWED
    TO CHANGE THINGS, RIGHT?

            - UM...

  - WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO KEEP
OUR HEADS DOWN UNTIL WE'RE 60...

 BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MAKE OURSELVES HAPPY...

       SHE'S GONNA BE M--

   SHE'S GONNA BE MISERABLE.

YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT?

            - WHAT?

   - PRETTY FUCKING GOOD DAD.

        YOU'RE A PRETTY
       FUCKING GOOD DAD.

        AND I LOVE YOU.

             FUCK.

     - I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

           - [cooing]

      [light guitar music]

              Â¶ Â¶

    - Â¶ SHE HOPES THAT THIS
       COULD BE THE ONE Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

       Â¶ SHE HOLDS IT UP
     IN FRONT OF THE SUN Â¶

      Â¶ AGAIN AND AGAIN Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

        Â¶ THE BEST OF US
       ARE UNDER ATTACK Â¶

     Â¶ THEY FORCE YOU DOWN
        ONTO YOUR BACK Â¶

      Â¶ AGAIN AND AGAIN Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

          Â¶ HOLD ON Â¶

          Â¶ HOLD ON Â¶

          Â¶ HOLD ON Â¶

              Â¶ Â¶

        - BE RIGHT BACK.

       [knocking on door]

             - HEY.
             - OH.

              HI.

         IS TANK HERE?

     - YEAH, HE'S SLEEPING.

 DO YOU WANT ME TO GO GET HIM?

     - NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

          I'M LONNIE.

        - HI, I'M SEVEN.

          - HI, SEVEN.

    HE'S TOLD ME VERY LITTLE
           ABOUT YOU.

           - [laughs]

          WHO'S THAT?

 - OH, THAT'S CLOVER AND XANA.

     - HI, CLOVER AND XANA.

  - HEY, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
     AND GIVE THIS TO HIM?

            - OKAY.

        - JUST TELL HIM
      IT'S FOR FACE FOOD.

          - OH, OKAY.
        HE'LL LIKE THAT.

         I JUST GOT HIM
      SOME FRESH AVOCADOS.

       - THAT'S AWESOME.

  - WHERE YOU GUYS HEADING TO?

     YOU GOT SO MUCH STUFF
          IN YOUR CAR.

        - I DON'T KNOW.

      WE'RE THINKING ABOUT
         MAKING A MOVE.

   - WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

       - WE HAVEN'T QUITE
        FIGURED IT OUT.

        MAYBE PORTLAND.

     - OH, I LOVE PORTLAND.

 I MET AN OWL THERE ONCE THAT--

     YEAH, REALLY SHOWED ME
     WHERE TO GO, YOU KNOW?

       - YOU MET AN OWL?

            - YEAH.
         OR IT MET ME.

          - RIGHT ON.

        ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

         - ARE YOU SURE
   YOU DON'T WANT TO COME IN?

     MAKE YOU SOME TEA. NO?
           - NO. NO.

       THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
            - OKAY.

 - HEY, TELL HIM HE WAS RIGHT.
            - OKAY.

       - TELL HIM HE WAS
      THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

           - [laughs]

           ALL RIGHT.
