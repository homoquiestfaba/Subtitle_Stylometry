Looks like you need a tow.

Is that a pig?

Well, if it's a dog,
then I need glasses.

I need a phone.

Where am I anyway?

Haven Falls.

Haven Falls?

Last time I checked.

You okay, fella?

Maybe.

Where's that church?

Can you take me there?

Well, I do fancy
myself a modern woman,

but normally I date someone
before a trip to the chapel.

You know, dinner, the movies,

maybe even a Christmas
party or two.

I've got one week to write
the jingle of the season.

You take me to that chapel,

I'll take you to the movies.

I promise.

Your friend have a name?

Come on, Penelope.

Penelope?

Candy for breakfast?

It's Christmas.

Candy canes are allowed
at any time of day.

Everybody knows that.

Do they or is it just
your excuse to eat sweets 24/7?

For me theseare the best
part about Christmas.

Oh, yeah, keeps you away from
all the mushy, feel good parts.

Exactly.

I don't subscribe to
the artificial sweetness,

but delicious
Christmas sugar cookies?

Those are the facts
I can support.

You ready for the meeting?

Got your holiday pitch?

I do. Yeah, it's great.

It's, uh...
It's really newsworthy.

Do you think Dennis will agree?

Absolutely.
Dennis is going to love it.

Right after I convince him to.

Come on, everyone.
Meeting's about to begin.

Alright. Shall we?

Jen, you're up.

Holiday hot yoga,
it's a growing trend.

Studies show it
eliminates toxins

and burns extra calories.

It's perfect for people who
overindulge at Christmas.

Great!
Let's make that a priority.

Next up, Alli Blakeman.

What do you have for us in
travel and entertainment?

Well, a bit of a pivot,
actually.

I have come across a study,
an exciting study

that will blow your mind.

Scientists have made incredible
medical advancements using

ultra violet light.

Do they these lights
in a new Christmas movie?

Well, no, but...

Are they offering them at
the world's most charming

Christmas destination?

Uh... No. No, they are not.

Mm.

Alright team.

Consider Christmas
officially kicked off.

Meeting adjourned.

Alli, hang back.

Don't worry.
It's Christmas. He'll be nice.

Alli, you're a great writer.

That's why I hired you
in travel and entertainment.

And I'm so grateful to write for

a big platform
like The Sentinel,

but, Dennis, the news team
is where I belong.

The news team wins Pulitzers.

That is my dream.

I want to make
a difference in the world.

You have loyal readers.

Your work makes
a difference to them.

Of course.

Of course, Dennis.

Okay. I'll tell you what.

I have a story I need covered.

You do a good job,

and I'll consider you for
transfer to the news division.

Really?!

Oh, my God. Dennis, I could...

I won't,
because it's inappropriate,

but thank you!

What's the story?

Well, this year marks the 65th
anniversary of the movie

Christmas With You.

Okay.

It was filmed in
White Falls, New York.

They even premiered it
at a local theater.

I want you to go up there
and write a piece.

Okay. On an old movie?

It's still a holiday classic.

You do know it, right?

Of course.

You can't escape that song,
it's everywhere.

Personally,
I think it's a bit over-played.

It's my wife's favorite.

I see.

Well then, consider it
an honor to report on it.

Dennis, this going to is be

the best article
I've ever written,

and you will see that I
belong on the news team.

I said I'd consider it.

That's good enough for me.

What happened? What'd he say?

Dennis gave me an assignment,

covering the holiday classic
Christmas With You.

Shouldn't you be
stress eating fruit cake?

That's everything
you want to avoid.

Well, we made a deal.

Dennis is giving me
a shot at the news,

if I write an incredible
Christmas With You article.

That's great!

Yeah, yeah.

See, he wants me to
go up to White Falls.

You know,
where they shot the movie.

Where's that?

It's like an hour north,

but I don't want a movie set,
I want a story.

One that'll really show
Dennis my potential.

You should interview
Walter Andrews.

I heard he lives at
a fancy hotel in the Hamptons.

Really?

Everyone loves
a where are they now story.

Okay. Uh-huh.

Good old Walter
still has a publicist.

That's actors.
They never miss an opportunity

to bask in the limelight.

Hi, this Alli Blakeman
from The Sentinel.

Yes, I was hoping to
get an interview with

Walter Andrews regarding
the 65th anniversary of

""Christmas with You."

Well, it would be a feel good
piece honoring both the song

and the movie, and...

I see.
Well, thank you for your time.

So, you're not packing
your bags for the Hamptons?

Apparently Walter
hates the press

and wouldn't speak to me
even if Santa asked him to.

Sounds like you can't
escape White Falls.

Small towns are
fun at Christmas.

â™ª

Excuse me.

I'm looking for
the White Falls Inn.

Could you point me in
the right direction?

Oh, here for the holidays?

No, work actually.

Oh. Well, you just hang a right,

keep walking past
the church over the bridge

and then take
a left on Main Street.

It is on your left.

Okay. Thanks.

What kind of work?
If you don't mind me asking.

Well, I'm writing a story
on Christmas With You.

Yeah, I read online that
there's a tour of the locations

where the movie was shot.

This is White Falls right?

Oh, yes, yes, the movie
was filmed here ages ago.

I can't remember when
they last did tours.

Oh.

But you could check out
the Westdale theater.

That's where
the movie premiered.

I think they have
some memorabilia.

The owners are big fans.

The Westdale?

It's just down from
the inn on the right.

You cannot miss it.

Okay. Thanks.

Uh.

Excuse me.

Excuse me?
Oh!

I'm so sorry.

In my defense, you did startle
a man on top of a ladder.

Well, here's your A.

Okay. Thank you.

And...

My E and my S.

Here, E and your S.

Brad Westdale.
Welcome to our theater.

First showing's at 2:00pm.

Alli Blakeman.
But I'm not here to see a movie.

I work for The Sentinel
and am writing an article

on Christmas With You.

Well, you're in the right place.

It premiered at this
theater 65 years ago.

Great, do you mind
if I take a tour?

Sure. As long as this is
not one of those hit pieces.

"25 Reasons Why Old Movies
Are Only For Boomers,"

"How Old Hollywood
Promotes Flat Earth Theory."

Not at all.

I'm just here for the facts,
unless you've have evidence

about flat earth, in which case
I'm sorry but the world

needs to know.

Come on.

â™ª

Ooh, do I smell kettle corn?

Even better.

This is Santa's popcorn.

A Westdale classic.

Instead of butter
we drizzle marshmallow

and then add in some
Christmas candies.

Kids love it.

Marshmallow on popcorn?

Yeah! My great grandfather
was from France,

and apparently that's
where marshmallow are from.

My grandma had it
on everything as a kid.

Mm.

Mm!

Who would have thunk it?

I would come here
every day just for this.

Let's see. Okay.

Uh, great.

Come on.

Who's uncle Brad's new friend?

She's a very pretty friend.

Alli, let me introduce you to
the theater's official

decorating team.

This is my grandma, Margaret,
my sister, Tracy,

and my niece,
our little star, Chloe.

Ah, very nice to meet you.

You, too.

Alli is writing
an article for The Sentinel

on the Christmas With You
anniversary.

That's my favorite movie.

So the whole family works here?

Oh. Yes, dear, but Brad does
all the heavy lifting.

Ah.
It's true.

Always has to.

When he was a kid, remember?

We could not get
him to come home.

I'm right here.
You don't have to talk about me

in the third person.

He took his first
steps right over there.

Practically ran into
the theater itself.

That's right.

Oh, Gran, do you remember
when he got fell

into the candy case?

Right in there, Alli.

Alright now. Alli is here for
Hollywood history, not mine.

Yes, although I do enjoy
seeing you sweat a bit,

I'm here for the facts about
Christmas With You.

Ask anything.

It's our favorite
part of Christmas.

Come on, let me show you
behind the curtain.

There's no Oz. Just me.

It's nice to meet you guys.

You, too.
Bye-bye.

The projector room.

Where man and machine do
a highly choreographed dance.

Sounds like a sci-fi movie.

Well, the projectionist has
to make sure the reel changes

are done at exactly
the precise time

otherwise the illusion
is broken.

And to think all these
little still frames

can hold so much power.

Yeah, it's a movie.

It's a time machine.

Movies can take you anywhere,
you just gotta let 'em.

To Casablanca or the Titanic

or maybe just singing
a song in the rain.

Clear fan of the classics, huh?

Mm-hm.

They were glamorous,
but don't you think movies

were far-fetched back then?

Unrealistic versions of life?

And Star Wars is a documentary?

TouchÃ©.

But people don't break out
into a song and dance

under street lamps.
That would be weird.

Not when you're telling
the girl of your dreams

that she's your Christmas Star,
you know?

Shining her light on love.

Speaking of which.

That scene was filmed
right outside our theater.

Okay, that was a sweet moment
in Christmas With You.

Sweet?

It was iconic.

I'm looking for
a story not a scene.

The movie is the story.

Okay, I've been in
rooms with people from

all different walks of life
and they all find

common ground with this movie.

That's powerful.

Well, Christmas is
the most popular holiday.

True, but the movies bring
it to another level, right?

Like anything is
possible at Christmas.

You make it sound so easy.

Maybe it is.

Picture this,
the lights are dimming,

signaling the show is starting.

You take your popcorn
and make your way

down to the theater.

Well, I do like the popcorn.

After you.

It's such a charming theater.

It's more than just a theater.

It's a a tele-porter.

Here. Take a seat. Let me...
Let me paint a picture for you.

Alright you have my attention.

Okay, so, when the lights lower

and the screen
flickers with images,

everyone in this room
takes off on a journey.

We follow a hero
or heroine as they

tackle a life changing event,
fall in love,

and in the end this
entire theater believes

that happy endings do exist.

And then the lights go up

and everyone is back to reality.

Sure, but with a renewed
sense that magic is possible.

Like a kid on Christmas morning.

I don't know if they
have that much power.

I mean, they're just movies.

They don't have to be.

And you think everyone walks out
of here with that same feeling?

Yeah! I mean,
Christmas and the movies,

both deliver happy endings.

And what's your happy ending?

For White Falls to reclaim
its place in cinematic history.

Mm-hm.

My grandma used to tell a story
about how the whole town used to

go out celebrating
the movie and Christmas.

There was so much holiday pride.

Over the years all
that just disappeared.

Well, people still
watch the movie.

I mean, it's always on TV.

It's not the same.

I've wanted to throw
a big screening like this

for a while now

So, when the studio restored it,
I jumped at the chance.

So, all of this is
for White Falls?

Well, and my grandma.

It's her favorite movie.

Always reminds her of
the importance of love.

Can I use that for my story?

Sure. Yeah.

You know, a good article
in The Sentinel might just be

the Christmas miracle we need.

And who knows, if you come,
maybe by the end of the night

you'll be shouting
from the rooftops like in

Christmas With You.

No, no, no. See, that is
something you will definitely

only see in the movies.

I don't know.

This is a room with
a few stories.

Hah.

Hm.

Wow.

They don't make dresses
like that anymore.

No, they do not.

Did you collect all this?

My grandparents started it,
but I've kept up the tradition.

I love this. May I?

Yeah, go ahead.

Very old Hollywood.

Have you ever thought
about branching out?

You know, beyond White Falls.

Well, I did get an offer from

the Film Archival Institute
in D.C.

Oh.

But I don't know if
I'm a big city guy.

It just feels so cold.

It's no colder than White Falls.

Not like that.

I mean, you see all
these people together,

but do they really
know each other?

Well, that would be impossible.

Oh, you know,
walking down the street

and knowing your
neighbors is nice, though.

Christmas is about togetherness.

Walter Andrews, so handsome.

Do you have any
stories about him?

Well, my grandma was actually
the one who convinced him

to have the movie premiere here.

Really?
Yeah.

She worked as the ticket
taker at the time

and one day she asked him.

Now you tell me.

Well, she's modest about it,

but the town was so
thrilled at the notoriety

that they gifted the theater
to my grandparents afterwards.

No wonder it's your
grandmother's favorite movie.

How did your grandfather
feel about her chatting up

Hollywood's most
notorious ladies' man?

I don't think he worried.

They knew they were soul mates
the moment they met.

Ah, that's romantic.

Their love story
was the real deal.

Even better than the movies.

Coming from you,
that says a lot.

Is this the original?

Because it looks handwritten.

Yeah, it is.

The was actually supposed to
just be a generic studio tune,

but Walter Andrews wrote this
while filming in White Falls

one day, and insisted
that it be in the movie.

Huh. Would you mind
if I took a photo?

Go ahead.

You can... if you want me to...

Oh, I'm so sorry.

It's okay. It's fine.

What's this?

I don't know.

"My Dearest D,
I wrote this song for you."

Run away with me.

I'll give it all up for you.

Let's spend the rest of
our Christmases together.

"I love you. W.A."

W.A. is obviously
Walter Andrews, but who is D?

I don't know.

Maybe somebody that
worked on the film with him?

What do you think?

I think this is serendipity.

Everyone loves an origin story.

Imagine who inspired
one of the most famous

Christmas songs of all time?

And as far as I know,
Walter Andrews never married

after he filmed this movie.

I mean, the three previous
divorces probably destroyed

his faith in marriage.

Or "D" is a little heartbreaker

and he never felt he
could fall in love again.

This is a good story
waiting to be told.

This has been here for
as long as I can remember.

Maybe my grandma would know.

Here. Come on.

Thank you.

Do you know what you want?

Yes.

What do you want?
Is it a secret?

No. I want a toy drum
with a remote

and a model airplane.

Oh, my gosh. That's fantastic.

What a good choice.
Hey, Grandma, wait up.

The sheet music from
Christmas With You,

we found a dedication
on the back.

We found a love letter,
actually.

Have you ever seen it?

I've no idea.

Walter was friendly
with many ladies.

Okay, is there anybody with
the name D that you remember?

So many people
worked on that movie,

It's hard to tell.

It is a lovely note.

Yeah.

How romantic to have
Hollywood's biggest star

write a song for you?

That's every girl's dream.

Well, maybe some,
but right now it's this

this girl's dream to meet Santa.

If you have any luck,
let me know. Bye.

Bye.

I have to find out right?

I mean this song is
a holiday treasure.

I don't even know what
Christmas is like without it.

I'm going to
hit the town tomorrow

and start questioning
possible witnesses.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Maybe a softer approach?

This isn't Law and Order.

No, but I am solving a mystery.

Yeah, but this story
affects more than just you.

Let me help.

Alright.

I guess I could use an expert.

I have some work
to do at my hotel.

Could I meet you
here tomorrow morning?

It's a date.

As in date and time.

Totally professional of course.

Of course.

I will be here.

Okay.

Hey, Alli,
how's the story coming?

Good! Great! Um...

I came across
something exciting.

This isn't one of
your pivots is it?

Yes, but a Christmas one.

Better be. Shoot.

Okay. So, I was researching
in White Falls today

and I came across an original
music sheet from the theme song

for Christmas With You.

Okay, and?

There was a handwritten
love letter from Walter Andrews

on the back. Turns out he
wrote the song for someone.

A real someone.

The letter implied
that he was willing to

give up anything
for his lady love.

Really? And who is she?

Well, that's the mystery.

All we know is that her name
starts with the letter "D."

You are tenacious.

Okay, you got two weeks.

Make it count.
We publish Christmas Eve.

I will. Thank you, Dennis.

Yes!

You've been busy.

Thought I'd get a head start.

None of the articles
mention anyone with a name

starting with D.

Maybe it was his
co-star Lana Murdock

and he called her "doll?"

No, that's doubtful.
I researched Lana.

She was pregnant during filming,

and her husband was
with her on location.

And you couldn't find the cast
and crew listed online?

No dancer #3 named Doris?

Well, unfortunately,
it wasn't that detailed.

The only D names listed were in
post-production or accounting.

Hopefully we'll get some
information from the locals.

Where should we start?

Right here.

Thank you.

You got it.

You know, his is where
Jack and Betsy fell in love.

Jack and Betsy, huh?

The lead characters
from the movie.

Right, sorry I got distracted
by all these sweets.

Hello, Brad.

Hi, Mrs. Caldwell.

Now, what can I help
you with today?

We're interested in any
memories you may have of

Christmas With You.

Oh, you've come to
pick my brain, huh?

Yes, ma'am.

Is this about the screening?

Yes and no.

Hi, my name's Alli Blakeman,

I'm a reporter
from The Sentinel.

I'm actually writing
an article on the movie.

How would you feel about
answering a few questions?

Oh, sure.
Great.

Do you remember any of
the cast and crew from the film?

Everyone knew the stars
Walter Andrews and Lana Murdock.

She was gorgeous
and he was so personable

that sometimes it was hard to
believe he was such a big star.

And do you recall anyone with
the name starting with "D"

that was close to Mr. Andrews?

Mm, no. I mean, there was always
so many people around him,

and I just remember
watching the filming,

and he was magical.
They were magical.

And, oh,
that song gets me every time.

â™ª All in time,
we'll see what's meant to be â™ª

I mean how could
a big city ad man

and a farm girl
rewrite destiny like that?

That is a good question.

Now, Mrs. Caldwell.

Mm-hm.

Try and think back.

Is there anyone in particular
you remember hanging around him?

Maybe a romantic interest?

Uhh...

I'm not sure.

Maybe.

Mrs. Caldwell,
do you still offer

the gingerbread house building?

Like the one from the movie?

I do.

I'll bring one right out.

Amazing. Thank you.

Do we really have time for this?

Dial back on the interrogation.

Familiar settings
trigger memories.

She'll start talking.

Walter Andrews
decorated at least

five of these during the shoot.

He would always give me candy
when my mom wasn't looking.

Seem like he was a nice guy.

Oh, yeah, he bought the entire
crew Christmas cookies.

My parents were thrilled.

He gave us a lot of orders.

Always cookies?

Mostly, but during the premiere
he had a cake made.

It was red velvet with
green and white frosting.

He special ordered it
and was very secretive about it.

I think it was
a surprise for someone.

Did you deliver it?

No. He came
and he picked it up himself.

I remember it was
after the store closed

and I was there with Dad.

My mother kept
excellent records.

I'm going to check and see what
I can find in the back.

Awesome. Thank you.

Wow.
Hey.

Go ahead, say I told ya so.

Well, we don't have
a name just yet.

Once she comes back,
we should get going.

Why? We're having fun.

Hey, hey! You're eating
the last of our roof.

Oh, well. I've always been
more of a minimalist.

So, where did you
get the sweet tooth?

Mom or dad?

Mm, I think they were
probably the cause.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah, my... my parents
divorced when I was younger.

Is that why you're not
a Christmas fanatic?

You know, Christmas for me,
it was always more about

separation than togetherness.

I guess not really
knowing where you belong

sort of sours the festivities.

But don't worry, I'm fine.
I'm good.

You know, I found
my place in journalism.

That's what matters to me.

Facts over feelings.

Less disappointment that way.

What about escapism?

Mm. You can't outrun the truth.

Why try?

Maybe not, but it's nice to

take a break every now and then.

Alright, so, before you go,
there's nothing on the cake,

but I found something
from the movie that has

a lot of names on it.

I think that it was from
the day that they shot here.

Maybe it'll help?

It's a call sheet. Yes!

Oh, great.
Well, then, you can use it,

but bring it back.
I'll take this.

Please be careful.

We will guard this with
our lives, Mrs. Caldwell.

Thank you.
Okay. Alright now.

Thank you.

Okay, research and coffee?
What do you say?

Yes, with a fine-toothed comb.

There are three D names
on the call sheet.

Debbie, Dolores, Diana.

One of them has to be our lady.

It's a sign!

What?

The street lamp.
It just turned on.

Yes, because it is dusk.

How is that a sign?

Oh, come on, you know.

This is where
the iconic scene from

Christmas With You takes place.

This is the streetlight.

Huh.

Picture it.

Jack has just fallen
in love with Betsy.

She inspires him to write
his greatest love song

and he sings it to her right
here under this street lamp.

His Christmas gift to her.

Now, Jack has a fiancÃ©
back in New York,

but Betsy gives him life,
you know?

Makes him believe in love again.

He belts his heart out to her,
they dance in the street.

Betsy tells him that she
never knew her heart could sing.

And he can't help himself,
he kisses her.

And this is right before he goes
back to his fiancÃ© in the city.

Well, he's obligated to go back
because of the holiday

variety show, but we all
know he belongs with Betsy.

That's the drama.

And the street lamp?

It's a metaphor for
the Christmas star

bringing them together.

That's a stretch.

It sets up their romance, right?

So, when he calls out
to her from the rooftop,

you believe it.

In the freezing cold
like a crazy person.

Crazy in love at Christmas.

Alright,
in the spirit of Christmas,

I'll take it as a sign.

And I'll also take that.

Uh, why don't
I send you a picture?

You really should trust me.

Okay. I'll meet you
here tomorrow morning?

Sounds like a plan.

Okay. Send me a pic.

Debbie the make-up artist lives
between here and the city.

I've scheduled
a meeting for today.

Dolores, the dancer,
unfortunately passed away,

but I'm emailing you
her son's contact info.

Okay.
So, that leaves Diana Parker,

the assistant location manager.

She might still be a local.

Maybe a different last name?

I'm so glad you're writing this.

It's such
an inspiring love story.

Between a big city ad man
and farmer's daughter?

I mean, do you know
how unrealistic that is?

That's what's great about it.

The universe
wanted them together.

I mean, what are the odds
of his car breaking down

just as she's walking
her pig across the street?

It's a movie.

Well, it's inspiring.

I need to surrender
my love life to Christmas,

because the dating apps
are failing me.

I've put in all my info,
right down to my favorite soap,

and the best thing they
can match me with is Jimmy,

a part-time DJ
living with his mother.

Ooh. Yikes.

How romantic would it be to
just take one look at someone

and everything changes
for the better?

And your heart sings
from the rooftops.

Yes! That's what I want.

My heart to sing.

That is movie love.

They roll credits
right before the divorce.

Everyone deserves romance.

Like Walter Andrews.

My life would be so much
easier if I could just

talk to that man.

Alright. I have to run.

I'm meeting Brad, just text me
if you get any info, okay?

Oh, yeah? Brad? I googled him.

Why?

Because you haven't been on
a date since you started here.

It's not like that.

He's really cute.

Give in to romance.

Bye, Jen.

Brad: I can't believe
she's still doing make up.

It's for her granddaughter's
ballet recital, the Nutcracker.

I think it's sweet.

There you go.

Have a seat.

Thank you.

They're cute.

Cute but exhausting.

Okay. Lay it on me, Doll.

You said on the phone,
you're writing a story

on Christmas With You?

Yes, and thank you
so much for obliging.

My pleasure.

That was a special
time in my life.

Did you know Walter well?

That was our
only movie together.

It was actually my first.

I was a nervous Nelly.

He was so handsome.

Some stars,
they need lots of makeup.

Not Walter.

He was a walking
streak of sex appeal.

And charming,
gosh, that man could

outshine a Christmas tree.

All the girls adored him.

All the men wanted to be him.

He was special.

So, you two were close?

You do tend to get to know
someone when you powder

their nose a hundred
times a day.

How close exactly?

Oh, I wasn't one of
the Walter girls

if that's what you're asking.

I would have been.

Mm. Happily.

Unfortunately,
someone else caught his eye.

He was always
sneaking off from set.

I had to cover
for him a few times.

And who was it?

Walter was very private.

I can't say I blame him.

The gossip rags were
always lurking for stories.

Fame can be
a double edged sword.

That's the truth.

Whoever he was
seeing was special.

He had love dancing in his eyes.

When Walter sang that song
under the street lamp,

ah, we all fell in love.

â™ª

Tracy:
I found those in the attic,

and I asked Grandma if
Walter Andrews ever came back

to town after the premiere.

She said no,
not to her knowledge.

Maybe D took him up on his offer
and followed him to Hollywood.

Well, he never married again.

You'd think he
would have if she did.

It's true, and he didn't
give up his career.

I think she broke his heart.

He wrote the song
because he loved this woman

and was coming
back to her at all costs.

That's also
the plot of the movie.

Walter's note
on the back tells me

it was more than just
a plot convenience.

Uncle Brad,
come make the Christmas colors.

I would love to.

Uh, it's Dolores's son.
I'm going to...

Great, yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Lead the way, oh princess.
Let's go.

Yes, hello.
Thank you for calling me back.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Here we go.

Right in the centre, right?

Oh, I see. Yes. I understand.

And now say the magic wish.

Icicle, Icicle,
on a Christmas night,

grant me my wish
and show me your light.

Woo! You did it!
Wow, look at that.

Whoa!

I'm dizzy, how about you?

Okay, Chloe. Time to go.

Oh, hey, go get your mama.

Bye.

Hey, any...
Any luck with Dolores' son?

Well, his parents
met on the movie.

They were both dancers.

Walter Andrews actually
sent them a wedding present.

So, I'm knocking
Dolores off the list.

Cheer up, we still have Diana.

Well, we don't have
her contact information.

She emailed me back.

We can see her tomorrow.

That's great.

By the way, that little
light show you did with Chloe,

that was really sweet.

It's magical for a kid.

If only adults
didn't know better, huh?

They don't have to.

You just gotta believe.

There's something I want
to show you on the way back.

This is even better
than the light show.

Come on.

So, right here is where
they built the snowman

in Christmas With You.

No way. That was in a field.

No, they put a matte
painting over this wall.

More tricks to make you believe.

One person's trick
is another's reality.

And magic is where you make it.

You, know, whether it's turning
a chandelier into a light show

or the side of a theatre
into a winter wonderland.

That's why movies
are so important,

they bring dreams to life

and to the faithful
in those seats,

lives to dreams.

When did you stop dreaming?

I dream.

I have work ones all the time.

Or I'm still in school

and I forget to hand in a paper.

I mean in your life.

Says the man who spends all
his time in a dark theater?

Hey, I'm the guy
standing in the snow

who sees a farmer's field.
Who are you?

The girl standing with him
starting to lose feeling in her

toes while seeing
her article dissolve

like ice in the sun.

See, no one that poetic
could write a bad article.

What's it like to
be faith personified?

As I've said,
I just believe in happy endings.

And Christmas always delivers.

Ooh, yes please.

Hold on, hold on. Not yet.

Remember the scene where Jack
and Betsy both dropped their

candy canes
and then it formed a heart?

Yeah.

Okay, well, they borrowed that
tradition from White Falls,

and if two people
drop their candy canes

and it forms a heart,

whatever they wish
will come true.

Okay, come on, they obviously
placed them in the snow

for the movie.

Come on, you first.

We have wishes that
we need to come true.

Okay.
Close your eyes. Ready?

Count to three. One, two, three.

Drop.

Okay.

Now you?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

One, two, three. Drop.

Oh! What?!

Come on,
you've done this before.

This is a rigged game, isn't it?

Never and no. It's magic.

And now our dreams
will come true.

Well, thanks for
trying to cheer me up,

but I should get
back to the inn.

Um, Alli, tomorrow,

do you want to go
to the White Falls

Christmas tree lighting?

No work.

Yeah.

Yeah, that would be fun. Okay.

Okay.

Goodnight.

Great. See you then.

Hey, you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Your Christmas spirit
seems a little muted.

The tree lighting used to be
packed with locals and tourists.

I miss that.

It's still a fun event.

It's all how you
look at it right?

I see a VIP Tree Lighting.

Exclusive.

There's still
Christmas spirit here.

I mean, those sweaters there.

That took a lot of imagination.

Yeah, you're right.

Hey, you want a movie fun fact?

Can I use it for my story?

Maybe. You know the scene
where Jack buys the candy cane?

Mm-hm.

It was actually filmed
at the Hardware Store.

Oh. Was it a candy shop
once upon a time?

Another movie magic trick.

Tourists used to come
and look for the candy store,

never realizing it was just
created by a set designer.

Hm. Well, I guess you can
transform anything if you have

the right imagination.

Or anyone.

Come on.
You said no work tonight.

Well, I may have scheduled
to meet Diana here.

She's a local. It's convenient.

Come on, guys, the Christmas
tree is about to sparkle.

Oh, then she's
going to have to wait.

Come on, let's enjoy
White Falls together.

Three, two, one!

Sparkle!

Let me get a photo of you guys.

All the Westdale's,
get in there.

Yeah, thank you!
That's nice.

Oh, wait.
You need to be in it, too.

No, no, no, no. It's fine.
Alli, come on.

Yes, come on.

Hey, Joyce. Do you mind
taking a photo for us?

My pleasure!

Alli Blakeman.
Thank you.

Nice to see you again.

I see you found the Westdales.

I did.

Okay, everyone say Christmas!

All: Christmas!

Pretty as a Christmas card.

Thank you.

You all have a fun night.

Oh! It's Diana.

I know it's killing you. Go on.

Hi. Diana.

Diana! Hi.

Hi.
Nice to meet you in person.

Nice to meet you, too.
Merry Christmas.

Please, sit.

Thanks. Merry Christmas to you.

I'm so glad you're a local.

Oh, yes, born and raised.

So, you're writing an article
on Christmas With You.

How's it going?

Some roadblocks,

but hopefully
that'll change soon.

So, you were location manager.

Did you ever meet
Walter Andrews?

I never got the chance.

I wish I did.

I'm actually looking
for who inspired the song.

I know Walter wrote it
while he was in town.

My cousin was his driver.

I got an inside scoop
on all things Walter.

Apparently, he would
take long walks at night.

He would write best then.

Did your cousin
ever mention driving

Walter and a girlfriend?

No. No, Walter was a private man

with a public life,

a life that could
give him everything he wanted.

Everything except
the one thing he yearned for.

Which was?

To be like everybody else.

No flashbulbs,

no fancy parties,

just the simple life.

To disappear really.

The studio and the fame,

it was like a cage.

Like some sort of colorful

bird in a gilded cage.

It was tragic really.

So, he never mentioned anything
about a special someone

from White Falls to your cousin.

Well, no, but it's funny now

that you mention it.

When my cousin drove
him back to the city,

he asked Walter if he'd
signed his name in cement,

ya know, like in Hollywood.

Walter told him no,

but he did in White Falls,

where he left his heart.

He never elaborated.

We just assumed
he loved the city.

Can I speak to your cousin?

Sadly, he passed.

We tried to find where Walter
may have signed his name,

but never did.

Thank you, Diana.

You may have saved my story.

Brad:
So, how is this a clue again?

Walter signed his name
in cement in White Falls.

Like they do at
Grauman's Chinese theater.

What if it was with D?

In a place special to them?

You're right,
that is a long shot.

He wrote the song
in White Falls.

What if there's
a clue in the lyrics?

Alli, you're doing
some mental gymnastics.

Just hear me out. Hear me out.

There's that one line.

"White silent night,

staring at the glowing lights."

Walter liked to
take walks at night.

Is there a place where you
can look out to glowing lights?

The town wasn't
built up back then,

so the list would be short.

Have we decided?

Do you have
the Christmas With You special?

The diner used to
have a special.

Charbroiled
Christmas with You burgers.

We have burgers.

We'll take two.

Thank you.

She's maybe 20.
Don't take it personally.

Unfortunately that is quick
becoming the norm in town.

Even at Christmas,
its hard to watch.

Maybe it's a sign
I should take that job in D.C.

I can't imagine
White Falls without you.

I can't.

Well, you haven't
been here that long.

I want White Falls to
remember how special it is

to be invited into millions of
peoples' homes every Christmas.

We used to
celebrate that honour.

If I can help bring
back that memory,

at least I can leave happy.

Enough about me.

How did you end up
at The Sentinel?

I took a job in
travel and entertainment

just to get my foot in the door.

Ever since, I've been trying
to convince my editor

that I can be a real journalist.

Report real news.

This isn't real to you?

No, I...

Okay, at first,
I thought it was just

going to be some
Christmas escapism.

Instead it's a very

real story of love

and maybe heartbreak.

Doesn't get more real than that.

Hopefully it gets me
on the news team.

People like you never fail
because they never give up.

I just hope your boss
can see your ambition.

Yeah. Me, too.

Hey, Dennis.

Hey kid, I'm checking in on you.

We're a week away
from Christmas Eve.

Have you found our mystery lady?

Not yet, but I'm working on it.

What happened to your leads?

They're still leading me.

Sort of.

Yes or no, will you have
a story ready by Christmas Eve?

Absolutely.
I won't let you down.

Please don't.

I've had marketing
teasing the story all week.

Call me.

Um, yeah Christmas With You

was filmed all over White Falls.

So, I'm sure if you
drive in any direction,

you're going to end up seeing
somewhere where you can see...

Actually,
this hardware store is where

Jack bought the candy canes.

They redressed it for the movie.

Oh, thanks.

Bye.

Sorry, just wanted to help.

No, thank you. Alli.
I didn't even know that.

I feel kind of famous now.

How did you know my name?

Small town.

You make it your
business to know folks.

That's how we look
out for each other.

Oh.

Hey.

Hey. Good morning.

I thought I heard you come in.

I did some research
and I think I know the spot.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Oh, wow!

This is what waking up on
Christmas morning feels like.

I wish I had
a Christmas tree my room.

This room always
books up at Christmas.

I'm honestly surprised
we were able to get in here.

Well, maybe I should upgrade.

Walter stayed here during
filming and for the premiere.

At the time the hotel was
the tallest building in town.

Wait until you see this view.

Alright.
Wow.

That is definitely
a romantic view.

I bet at night you could see
all of the glowing lights.

Apparently the balcony was
the last addition to the suite.

The manager's grandfather would
tell the story that the cement

wasn't even dry the morning
Walter Andrews checked in.

So, I don't know.
Maybe it's a long shot,

but do you think he could
have written his name

down here somewhere?

Pretty easy place
to woo a lady, huh?

Men knew how to talk
to ladies back then.

I think the internet
ruined romance.

Me, I'm old school.

I believe in looking
in a person's eyes

and knowing instantly
that they are special.

Like, my grandparents had that.

My grandfather took
my grandma on one date

before he deployed.

And she wrote letters
to him every day.

And actually waited
for him to return.

Wow, I mean,
that feels like a movie.

Nah. Real life.

Like my grandmother says,

you can't run from
your soul mate.

Well, I'm done.

Gosh. I need a plan B.

Why don't you come back
with me to the theater?

I'll get you some popcorn.

Oh, twist my arm.

I wonder if D
came to the premiere.

Do you think she knows
the song was written about her?

It's too bad we can't
just call Walter and ask.

I tried.

He won't speak to
anyone from the press.

I heard he's a bit of a recluse.

Imagine being the most
famous man in America

to just making
yourself invisible.

Hm. All stars
burn out eventually, right?

Some things last forever.

I love this tree.

So beautiful.

Reminds me of your grandfather.

We used to go walking down
Christmas Tree Lane.

What's Christmas Tree Lane?

It was in Christmas With You.

They borrowed it.

For years it was
a tradition in White Falls.

They would set up
a display of Christmas trees

in front of the theater.

The lights were so beautiful.

At night they just glowed.

You could smell them
from right on the roof.

The roof? From the roof?

Thank you. Love you.

Is it?
Up, up, up. This way.

Come on, come on.

This has to be it right?
At night you could see

the glowing lights
on Main Street.

Brad! Check this out.

Looks like we have our
second Christmas miracle.

Her name is Daisy.

Amazing.

Any luck with Daisy?

I spoke to my friends
at SAG and the Academy,

and nobody named Daisy
worked on the film.

It's like every time I take
a step forward I hit a wall.

We live in
the age of information,

somebody has to know something.

Let's put the word
out on social media.

Full court press.

I'll use my account.
Can you get The Sentinel

to upload on their pages?

Yeah, I'll call tech right away.

Are you going to just
wait for a response?

No. I'm gonna hit the pavement.

It's weird.
I've only been here a week

and it feels like
I know these people.

It's nice.

I'm liking this new you.

You're turning into the farmer's
daughter of White Falls.

You're crazy.

Wish me luck.

Good luck.

The Walter Andrews
bought his candy canes

right at this very counter.

Ah. Thanks.

Hey, Alli.

Your little Christmas fun fact
has really boosted business.

I even giving out
candy canes with every purchase.

For you.

Thank you, Stan.
I'm happy to help.

Hey, you don't happen to know
a Daisy's in town, do you?

She's probably be around
her 70's or 80's.

Can't say that I do.

You know, I tried to check
the city registrar's office,

but they're closed because of
holiday hours. So, I'm just...

My mom works there.

Let me make a call.
She can help you out.

Really?
Yeah.

That would be amazing.

Stan, thank you.

Of course.
Okay.

Stan's Mom:
Okay. Here are the years...

yeah, that you requested.

Oh, thank you.

Stan told me that you're doing
a story on Christmas With You.

Yeah, the movie,
but more importantly,

the person who
inspired the song.

Oh, lucky girl whoever she was.

Oh, Walter Andrews,
he makes my heart sing.

Man, I cry every time
I hear that song.

Just knowing that

Jack has to leave after
finding the love of his life.

Good thing he comes
back in the end.

He does.

And, you know, when he calls
out to Betsy from the rooftop.

Oh, that's when
you know it is love.

That's what Christmas
is all about.

Okay, uh...

Good luck and let me know
if there's anything you need.

Thank you.
Okay.

Elaine?

Elaine!
Yup?

I found a transfer of deed
from Walter Andrews

to Margaret Osborne.

Oh, yeah, well,
Margaret Westdale now.

I thought that the city gifted
the Westdales' the theatre

after the premiere,

but this date is November 1955.

The movie didn't
come out until December.

No. The city never
owned the theater.

It was always under
private ownership.

Here, um...

Let me show you.

Here are

pictures from the opening,

when they changed
the name to the Westdale.

See?

Martin and Daisy Westdale

proudly open their new cinema.

Daisy?

No. That doesn't make sense.

Oh, well, Marguerite in
French also means daisy.

It's probably how
she got the nickname.

I'm sure she used that
when she was growing up.

Hey, Jen. I found Daisy.
It's urgent you call me back.

Is Brad here?

No, ma'am.
He should be here soon, though.

Just feel free to enjoy
the movie while you wait.

Did you say
that was on the 28th?

Oh, I'm so sorry.

That's the night
our favourite charity's

having their little fundraiser.

Oh, what charity is that?

The MTBTDS.

MTBTDS?

Money To Bury The Dead Sea.

Well, thank you, gentlemen.
You have my card.

Yeah, you want it back?

No, I have plenty.
Thank you.

I wonder who blew him up.

Hey, uh, Freddy.

Don't look now, but, uh,

my charm has been recognized.

Oh, I'll be very coy about it.

Nonchalant vibes.

Boy, she's a beauty, ain't she?

Oh, boy.

Freddy: You see that
ring around her finger?

She's got enough karats
there to feed 2000 rabbits.

Hey.

You found her?

Yep.

Why aren't you more excited?

Daisy is Brad's grandmother.

The city didn't
gift her the theater.

Walter Andrews did.

I thought her name was Margaret?

Daisy is a nickname.

It's French.

Brad clearly knows
nothing about this.

I mean, he thinks his
grandparents were soul mates,

and for good reason,
they had a magical love story.

I mean,
to think that Walter Andrews,

notorious playboy,

was willing to give up
Hollywood for her. That's crazy.

I know!

I showed Margaret the note
and she didn't say a word.

Obviously, she doesn't want her
family to know about the affair.

Are you sure it was an affair?

I mean, she ended up
with Brad's grandfather.

The man gifted her a theater
and she accepted it.

That's not a friendly gesture.

Their names are
in cement on the roof.

Wow, Daisy the little minx.

It's an incredible story,
isn't it?

The internet would go wild.

Dennis will give me that spot
on the news team for sure.

Then write it. You earned this.

But what about Brad?

This will destroy his family,

his faith, the theater.

Wow, so he's really
special to you.

He is,
but it's an incredible story,

and I just can't
believe I cracked it.

I mean, the woman inspired
one of the most famous

Christmas songs of all time.

She must want
the world to know, right?

Of course she would.

You'll make her famous.
Good work, kid.

Can't wait to read the story.

This is a private call.

If you want privacy,
don't use the conference room.

Alli, your instincts were right.

Everyone loves
a Hollywood romance.

It's like the real time version
of Christmas with You.

Big time star
falls for small town girl.

Except they didn't
end up together in the end.

Doesn't matter. We got one
of the greatest love songs

of all time out of it.

We publish Christmas Eve.
Good work, kid.

You just earned
your spot on the news team.

Hey! Congratulations!
You just made the news division.

Yeah, at what cost?

I like this new Alli.

One that puts
feelings over facts.

The fact is I'm feeling pretty
awful no matter what I do.

You're not breaking
up a marriage.

No...

But I may break a heart.

How did I not know that?

It was a childhood nickname
from 65 years ago.

How could you have known?

She kept it a secret
for a reason, Alli.

If you publish it's just
going to be a scandal.

Brad, your grandmother
chose your grandfather

over the biggest
star in the world.

That's true love.

It's bigger than the movies.
That's the story.

If the whole world reads about
my grandmother's private life,

as if it's entertainment,
on Christmas,

it'll devastate her
and my family.

You're right. You're right.

I won't publish this story.

I'll do the movie justice
without the scandal.

I'll find a way.

I hope so.

Hey.

There's always a way.

Walter Andrews on TV:
â™ª White silent night â™ª

â™ª Staring at
the glowing lights â™ª

â™ª I know that look â™ª

â™ª Means you're uneasy â™ª

â™ª Could it be â™ª

â™ª Because soon I have to go â™ª

â™ª And the nights â™ª

â™ª Have grown so cold â™ª

â™ª You can speak your
heart to me â™ª

â™ª Ask me any question â™ª

Extra marshmallows
for the sweet tooth.

Thanks for meeting me.

It is such a relief to see you
in a good mood.

I could barely sleep last night.

I was worried I had ruined
Christmas for you.

My grandmother left it in the
past, I should too.

If "Christmas With You" is still
her favourite movie,

there's no reason why I can't
still love it too.

Can I see?
Sure.

I had the printer do
another run.

I want to make sure we have
a full house.

Oh, and I got the red carpet.

And we're going to be
playing the music

over the outdoor speakers.

I think you may restore

White Falls' Christmas spirit
after all.

Not just me.
We make a good team.

Whoa!

Merry Christmas.
We are officially sold out.

Wow! I can't believe it!
Tracy, this looks incredible.

Thank you.

And thank you for trusting me
with it.

I know it wasn't easy.

You haven't even seen
the best part!

Wait, wait, isn't that from the
memorabilia room.

Maybe. Cue the music!

Perfect.
Thank you.

Oh, these are my poinsettias.

Ah, those are mine, thank you!
Fellas!

After listening to that song
for so many years,

just knowing now that it was
inspired by my grandma

is surreal.

No matter how or why it was
written,

it's brought joy to millions
of people.

And that's special.

What about you? The news team?

You'll still make it without
revealing Daisy, right?

Yeah... yeah.

"Christmas With You"
is the story.

It's a classic Christmas
tradition.

My editor will see that.

You know, he, uh... he has to.

I really appreciate you
making a sacrifice

on behalf of my family.

Thank you.

You going somewhere?

I promised Mrs. Caldwell

I'd help her put away some
inventory.

But, uh, dinner later tonight?

Sounds good.

It's a date.

A real one this time.

Hey, Dennis.
Alli.

We're two days from
Christmas Eve.

What's the ETA on your story?

It's coming.

You're not pivoting, are you?

Well...

We've been promoting
your story all week.

People want to know the mystery
woman behind the song.

I have plenty of material

to give you a heartwarming,
Christmassy article

about the song, about the movie,
about the town.

But the woman will remain
a mystery.

Huh, you're kidding, right?

But Dennis,
see, it's the mystery

that keeps the magic alive.

See, no one wants to go behind
the curtain and see Oz.

You give me a whale of a story
and you expect me

not to publish?
I hate to do this,

but if you can't deliver,
I'll find a writer who will.

No, you wouldn't. You can't.

Our entire readership has been
waiting on this story.

Even my wife is counting down
the days to find out.

It's complicated.

There are feelings involved.
How?

It's an affair
from 65 years ago!

Her husband is deceased!

Besides, it's facts,
not feelings, that matter.

That's your philosophy,
is it not?

If I don't have your story
in 24 hours,

I'm giving it to another writer.

I'll figure it out.

I'm counting on you, kid.

Hi, Margaret.

Oh, hello, dear.

Everything okay?

I...

I know about you and Walter
Andrews.

Oh.

After all these years,

maybe the world should know
the truth about

Walter Andrews' kind heart.

Is it okay if I record this?

Of course. Of course, dear.

It all started here.

I was 19, taking tickets.

And one day this handsome man
walked up.

Honestly, I had no idea
who he was.

Really? Walter Andrews?

Well, you don't expect to see a

big movie star in a small town.

It's probably why he liked me.

Pretty soon we were talking for
hours about books

and life and everything.

Suffice it to say, um, he missed
his movie that day.

And were you engaged
at the time?

Oh, heavens no.

No, Martin and I
had only gone on one date

before he was deployed.

But we wrote each other
every day.

I told Walter about Martin the
first night we met.

And Martin knew about Walter.

Neither one asked me to choose.

It's hard to stake a claim
on a girl like me.

I've always been my own woman.

I know the feeling.

During Walter's stay,

we saw each other every day.

We'd exchange books or sit up
on the roof and talk.

Oh, he loved it up there.

Especially at night.

Hmm.

Oh, we connected.

It's so nice having someone
so easy to talk to.

Did you love him, Margaret?

Oh, what does a girl of 19
know about love?

A lot...

I suspect.

Well, let's just say I enjoyed
Walter's company.

Until one day when we were
out walking,

this photographer took
our picture.

Next thing I knew,
Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper

were discussing Walter's flavour
of the month.

It was al very invasive.

Strangers speculating on
our lives.

I can imagine.

And what about the song?

Oh, yes.

Walter wrote that song.

And he said he'd give up
everything for me.

But I couldn't let him do that.

Walter loved to perform and the
world loved him.

I was just a small town girl.

I mean, who was I to end
that love affair?

You never answered my question.

Did you love him?

I did.

Yes.

And in a different lifetime,
we ruled the world.

But not in this one.

The song says it all,
doesn't it?

"All In Time."

Just wasn't ours.

My heart was Martin's.

And when he returned on
Christmas Eve,

I knew where I belonged.

And so did Walter.

So what about the theatre?

Oh, that was Walter's Christmas
gift to me.

His only request was never
to tell anyone.

Well, except for Martin,
of course.

He called it his monument
to his love for me.

Oh...

Through movie magic,
we could always be together.

He said, "Think of me"

"every time you look up
at the screen,

"and every time you hear
our song."

"And I'll be thinking of you."

May I?
Of course, dear.

After the movie left town,

I went by the name of Margaret,
my given name.

I left Daisy in the past.

In my heart,
she stayed with Walter.

So no regrets?

Not one.

The heart can hold an infinite
amount of love.

This is an incredible story.

You loved them both.

Oh, with all my heart.

Most people are lucky if they
ever find their soulmate.

I found two.

Write it like
you lived it, dear.

I will.

Good.

Thank you.

Thank you!

Oh!
Oh my God, are you...

I'm so sorry.

What is this?
Brad.

I can explain.

Still after the facts?

No matter whose feelings
you hurt.

No, Brad, it isn't what you
think it is.

I trusted you.

You promised!

Listen, the story was too big!

It was my editor!

I couldn't let another writer
break this story.

They don't know you like I do.

I guess you were right.

Happy endings only happen
in the movies.

Congratulations on making the
news division.

I hope it was worth destroying
a small town for.

Tracy?
Hey, can I come in?

It's Brad.
Is he okay?

Look, I know he thinks I'm a
terrible person, but...

Your grandmother gave me
permission,

and to be honest,
she encouraged it.

I know, I know.
She told me all about it.

My grandmother and the world's
biggest movie star.

I'm not gonna lie,
I'm very impressed.

And Brad?

He's taking the job in DC
after Christmas.

I mean, he always said that the
movies could take you...

Take you anywhere.

Yeah.

But I didn't think that they'd
take him from White Falls.

I've watched him these past
couple of weeks.

He belongs here.

His heart is in that theatre.

His heart is with you.

The heart holds an infinite
amount of love.

I am going to fix this, Tracy.

But I'm going to need your help.

Yes, I'm in!
Okay.

Um...

Hey, Jen? I need some help with
Walter Andrews.

Yeah, could you get me a listing
of every hotel in the Hamptons?

You're the best.

Okay. Um...

Oh! Do you have a dress
I could borrow?

Tracy: I was hoping
you'd say that.

I have "the" dress.

Grandma, you look stunning.

And so do you!

I don't know if I pull it off,
but thank you.

Oh, I haven't dressed up like
this in years.

I'd forgotten how good it feels.

Oh, this movie and the song have
brought me so much joy

through the years.

The Christmas gift that
keeps on giving.

Thank you for this screening.
It means the world.

You are more than welcome.

You're so handsome.

Except for one thing.

I... I can't.
This is from the movie!

Oh, yes you can!

Every leading man needs
a good hat.

Wow.

Perfect.

Oh, I love you so much, darling.

I love you too.

But now we have a hole
in our display.

Oh, no, no. Not necessarily.

Grandma, are you sure you
want this out there?

It represents the best
Christmas of my life.

Your grandfather returned
home to me.

And the biggest movie star
in the world

made me feel like a
leading lady.

It's time to share that love.

Uh, Brad, we have an emergency!
The Christmas candies,

I left them too close to the
popper and they melted,

and now we don't have any for
Santa's popcorn.

Okay. Uh, Mrs. Caldwell may have
something we can use.

Can you run over there?

I called. She's closed already.

She's getting ready for the
screening.

The diner. Joyce. She uses them
in the pancakes. Go there.

Uh, what if I don't get enough,
or what if I get the wrong kind?

Okay, okay. You drive,
I'll hop out.

See you soon.
Okay. Thank you.

Nice hat!
Heh, thanks!

I'll run in real fast.

Be right back, okay?
Go.

All right.

Thanks a million.
Yes.

You're a lifesaver.

Nice hat!

Thanks, it's my grandma's idea.

It suits you.

And now you have all my
Christmas candy.

Put it to good use.
Thank you. Appreciate it!

All right.
Hey, give it to me!

Score.
Awesome!

Okay, I sent you Alli's article.
Read it.

Tracy!
Read it!

And don't come back to the
theatre until you have.

What are you doing? Come on!

Are you serious? Come on!
You'll thank me!

Oh, come on!

Okay.

I've got this. I can do this.

Spirit of Christmas,
give me a sign.

Maybe I am a sign.

Okay.

Brad!

Brad!

If you'd have told me
two weeks ago

that I'd be shouting from
the rooftops,

I would have laughed.

That kind of thing only happens
in the movies, right?

Well, here I am.

You changed me, Brad.

You changed White Falls.

You made us all believers
that magic is real.

And you were right!

A movie can take you anywhere.

It took me to you.

And I don't want to spend a
lifetime wondering

what could have been.

Wolt looks just like
in the movie!

Man: It's Walter Andrews!

Daisy!

We finally meet outside
my dreams.

Oh, Walter!
It's so good to see you again!

Mr. Andrews!

I... I've got to...
Oh, yeah!

Go, go! I'm good.

Is that a pig?

Well, if it's a dog,
then I need glasses.

Avery Falls.

Avery Falls?
Last time I checked.

Jack!
Betsy!

I was wrong about us.
I was wrong about you.

And so were you.
Hey.

You're not empty-souled
Christmas ham peddler.

I was looking for you.

I thought you were inside
watching the movie.

I took a walk. A lot on my mind.

Well, you'll be relieved to know
the last reel is on

without a hitch.

Ah, yes.

The dance between man
and machine.

Brad, I know that you think I
betrayed your trust,

and I am so sorry, but...

I had to follow my feelings and
do what was right.

I'm not mad, Alli.

I'm touched, honestly.

Did you really mean everything
that you said up there?

Every word.

You made me realize that there
are great stories,

that make a difference,
that change people's lives.

And if we're lucky,
even our own.

You know they other day when we
dropped the candy canes?

I got my wish.

And what was that?

To spend Christmas with you.

Does this mean that you're
staying?

You've made my heart sing, Alli.
How could I leave?

You know, I can write from
anywhere.

Oh, you can, can you?
I can.

I guess sometimes life is like
the movies, huh?

This time it's better.

How in the world did you get
Walter Andrews here?

I name-dropped Daisy Osborne.

He told me that she's the love
of his life.

Wow.

It's funny how a dose of reality

restored my faith in Christmas.

Thank you.

Well, that's a Christmas
miracle.

We had it all along...

You're my Christmas star,

shining a light on love.

How could I ever let a gal
like you go?

I can't.
