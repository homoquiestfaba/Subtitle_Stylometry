Hello fence!

Hello leaves!

Hello sky!

Get off my lawn!

Do you want to be eaten alive?
No...

Then get out of here!

My trike?

Stay away from my house!

D.J. We're gonna be late!
I'm coming, I'm coming...

October 30th: Another
tricycle. - I'm coming!

Mom, he did it again!
He took another tricycle.

Honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day-

-staring at an old man
through a telescope.

But mom, there's something wrong
with that house. I'm serious...

What was that?

"I'm serious".
 His voice sounds funny.

Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?"

Maybe you should come with us?
The boy is too busy.
He's got his spying to do.

I'm not spying!

That's okay, buddy...
When I was your age
I did exactly the same thing-

of course it was with binoculars
and involved the lovely Jensen twins.

Neither of which were as lovely as
your beautiful mother.

Would you be an angel,
and help me bring out the inciser?
Hold on to this, buddy...

Elisabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens call the police-

-and hide in your closet.
He knows that.

See you tomorrow night!

What have you done!
Just let me drive this thing, will you?

Where is D.J?
You would be so happy-

-if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
Sorry, it's hard to see with the mask on.

Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder.

Why did you put up your window?

Chowder?
Hi, D.J!

Tell him you love him, dear. Please...
He knows that.

Say: "I love you son".
He knows I love him!

Why do you have to roll down the window?
We're gonna be late!

Love you...
that includes your dad.

I want a kiss.
He's had enough kisses.

Cheer up, it's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.

Check it out, I got a new ball.
Cool...

Speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullser or cryptkeeper?

I don't think I'm going
trick-or-treating this year.

Come on!
You're gonna break a six-year streak.

Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting to grown-up?

Three seconds on the clock...
I'm playing basketball.

It's time for an
in-your-face disgrace...

Are you okay?
My nose is in my brain!

Let me see... Oh my God!
You're a dork!

Where's my ball?

Oh no...

Sorry man...
Wait D.J, you're grown-up now-

-you go get it.
Your ball just landed on Nebbercrackers lawn.

It doesn't exist anymore.

I payed 28 dollars for that ball.
I reaped 10 yards and asked
my mom for a dollar 26 times.

I've never worked that hard
in my life.

Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
So?

So maybe he's sleeping.

Alright, I'll do it.
I'll never forget this.

Hurry though!

You!
No...

What have you done?

I'm so sorry... I didn't mean...
You are doomed!

Come on D.J!
Help, Chowder!

You think you can just terrorise my lawn?
You wanna be a dead person?

This place is not a playground for children!
This is my house!

Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from...

No siren...
Never a good sign.

I'm a murderer.
No you're not.

When it's an accident, they call it manslaugter.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

Babysitter's here.
See you, D.J!

D.J, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?

Hello?

Elisabeth, can I talk to you about something?
Oh yeah, of course you can, cantalope.

We are gonna have the bestes time.
I've got tons of neat activities planned.

They already left.
Oh, they did? They're gone?

Yes, and I need to talk to you.
Ok, so the usual deal. Indoors by nine-

-In your room by eleven, lights out your call.
Elisabeth!

And, it's Zee. Now listen up,
I controll the TV, the stereo and the phone.

I don't do boardgames, shrinkydinks
or tuck-ins.

I'm not your mother, I'm not your friend.
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?

I am practically a grown-up.
I don't even need you here... Elisabeth.

Gosh, D.J. Why did you break that?
But I didn't.

Let me ask you something,
who are they gonna believe?
Go to your room!

Hello?

Hello? Very funny.
Let's see have you like it.

Happy Halloween, doofus!

Nice one, Bones.
Look at his face, that's funny?

You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?

This is Bones, he's in a band.
Anyway, cantalope...
let's not open up the rulebook, okay?

since you're up,
way past your bedtime.

No, no, no... This is different.
Listen!

Wow, you called the neighbours.
Good for you.

I used dial 69, he called me.
Who called you?

Nebbercracker!
PS! He died today!
You lie.

Do not, and now I'm getting
phonecalls from his house.

A phonecall,
from beyond the grave...

I'm serious!
Oh, he's serious...
Did you know he was serious?

Give her back!
Oh, her? You mind?

Oh, come on, growse!
Come on, Bones.

I think she's having trouble breathing.
She might have something in her throath.

I'll look into it.
Bones, knock it off! Downstairs, now!

Sorry kid, can't play anymore.

<i>- You're so funny.
I know, it's like I don't even try.</i>

I got to stop doing this.

Homicide!
Chowder, where are your parents?

<i>My dad's at the pharmacy, and my mom is
at the movies with her personal trainer.</i>

Meet me at the dangerzone, now!
Fine.

<i>- I said, knock it off!
Come on, man.</i>

<i>I'm creeped out.
I saw an ambulance here today.</i>

<i>So?</i>

Maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
We should be so lucky, the guy is evil.

No, he's just a grudgy old dude.
Oh, really? Zee...

When I was ten years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite! I could fly it so high
you couldn't see it.

One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string, and it ended-

-right over there, across the street,
right at the edge of his lawn.

Did he take your kite?
He takes whatever lands on his lawn.

But that's not the point.
I saw him talking to his house-

-and kissing it.

Besides, everybody knows what he did to his wife...
What did he do to her?

He ate her!

<i>Stop it! Enough...!</i>

<i>Bones, I'm so sick of you!
You have no respect for women.</i>

<i>- What does that mean?
Get out!</i>

Prune..

What are you lookin' at?

You really are dead, aren't you?

I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker!
What are you gonna do about it?

My awesome kite?

Chowder!

Chowder?

Chowder, what are you doing?

Shut up!
What?

Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
No way?

They leave the keys in here.
Dear me?

Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me.

His blood is on my hands.
Now he's coming back for revenge.

You're really crazy right now,
have you noticed that?

I think you're just freaking out,
because you killed a guy today.

Life goes on...
for you.

Try to relax.
Be cool, like me.

Quit playing around!

I need your help.
Fine.

You want my help?
I got three words for you.

Trick - Or - Treat

Ok... whatever.
Let's go.

Hold on.

Chowder, come on.

The haunting is subtle.
Yet really really boring.
Can I go home now?

Chowder, shh, he'll hear us!
D.J...

This is why nobody will
sit next to us at lunch.

I'll go ding-dong-ditch the house,
and you'll see... No ghost!

Chowder, stop! Please...
I'm serious!

Come back.

Oh no, a bottle!
Put that down! Come back...
Please!

Hey D.J, who am I?
"Get off my lawn!"

Don't... Come on!

<i>Run!</i>

This way, this way, this way!

<i>Don't look back!</i>

Bones?
Coming!

Don't even think about crawling back here...

Boo! Trick-or-treat?

Good morning, mam. You just witnessed
a simulation of what you'll face this evening.

Studies show that households that run
out of candy are 55 % more likely to be "TP'ed".

To avert this tradegy...

I'm here selling Halloween-candy
for my school, Westbrook Prep.

Good school, I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?

Just trying to get a head start on life,
and secure a successfull future.

You want a successfull future?

When a guy with tattoos comes up to
the drive-thru... give him his burger

-not your phonenumber.

Thank you for the advice,
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business...

Eggs, shaving cream, toiletpaper!
Without candy I'm afraid your house is...
a bullseye with shingles!

Nice try.. But it's not my house
Babysitter?

Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for
left you 40 dollars in emergency money.

Maybe they left me 30.

Maybe you give me 20,
I write a receipt for 30,
and you pocket 10?

Maybe, and... I want two extra
bags of peanut clusters.

One bag, and...
I'll toss in a licorice whip.

You're good...

8 am... no detectable movement.
No detectable movement.

Hey D.J,
I brought you some chocolate...

Cover blown?

No detectable movement.
What are you two weirdos up to?

Oh, nothing... just something in the
house across the street just tried to eat us!

We've been up all night watching it...
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom!

Don't drink that.
Growse...

Whatever decease you guys have,
I'm sure it's got letters,
and that they make pills for it.

Zee, it's true!
There's something evil going on
across the street!

That's great, I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two...
astronomers... seen Bones?

He left last night unexpectedly,
and... he never came back.

He never came back?

The bottle!
Of course!

Okay, I don't have time for this.
Listen, Zee...

I don't know have to tell you this...
Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive!

Sherry Clawson...
I got to go!

Breakfast...
Happy Halloween, losers!

Hello...
What? What is it?

Oh... Nothing.
Let me see?

Oh, No!

D.J, that's your phone!

Girl...
Stop it!

Don't go any further!
Come here! Yes, over here...

Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are... I'm certified
to teach you baseball.

<i>Detectable movement!</i>

What do we do?
What do we do?
Come on!

Run, Chowder!
I'm running!

Help me!

Hello!

There's an angry dad on the phone,
looking for the one called Chowder!

<i>Hello... Losers!
I'm talking to you.</i>

He's worried about you.
He should be!

Start explaining!
The house is trying to eat us...

Stop explaining, I've had enough.
Where are you going?

I'm going to see what's happening
with that stupid house of yours.
No, no, no! Wait!

What is your problem?
Puberty... Lots, and lots of puberty.

No more Mountain Dew.
Right.

I'm going to find Bones.
You have fun, okay..
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine-

-And you tell him I say hey, okay?
Safe driving!

See ya!

You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh yeah, I made that whole puberty thing up.

Hey, I'm J.D... D.J.

<i>Yes dad, I meant to call you but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry!</i>

Absolutely, affirmative.
Okay, love you. Buy!

This is our little observation post.
Such as it where...

Yeah, the posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear it down. Put up some art.

Well, dad... Why don't you kiss my hairy butt!
Hey D.J, got any beer?

Well... hello there.
This is Chowder.

Charles to the ladies.
Jenny Vennet.

Two term class president at Westbrook Prep.
That's a tough school to come into.

Yeah, I got in.
But decided not to go.
It's a girl school.

Which is why... I didn't.

There's a great tacostand near here.
I hate mexican food.

Me too.
Me too.

Fascinating, isn't it?

It just sits there waiting.
Mocking us with its... houseness.

May I please use your phone?
Yeah sure, who are you calling?

My mother.
She's probably not going to believe you.

It's too much for the
adult's mind to comprehend.

Is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really growse!

D.J, you pee at bottles?
What are you talking about,
that one's your pee.

May I please speak with Elsa?
Her daughter.

Mom, I was selling chocolates in Mayville...

So... you hate mexican food?
Yeah, you too?

Yeah, in fact...
you might say I started hating it first.
Outside, in front of the house?

Fine, let's get technical, okay?
I started hating it through the telescope.

You can't call dibs on a
girl through a telescope.

You can't call dibs on a girl.
Just did.

Me too.
She didn't believe me.

Authority can be so...

Ok, normally I don't spend
time with guys like you...

but a house just tried to eat me,
so... you got one hour.

<i>Oh, puppy...</i>

Didn't see that coming.
Okay, I think it's time to call the police.

Do you realise what's going to happen tonight?
Hundreds of kids, walking right up to that house.

Wait, wait, wait! I think we're overreacting.
Only a total moron would walk up to
old man Nebbercrackers house.

Hey, my ball!
Chowder, no!

It's gonna be a bloodbath.

Good news, the cops are here.

Alright kids, this better be good.
I was in the forrest fighting a bear -

-when we got the call.

I was eating a doughnut!

<i>Alright you three! Step towards the car...
Now!</i>

Alright, they're at the car.
He's a rookie, first week on the job.

Officer, we have reason to believe that
there is a dangerous creature inside that house.

It may have killed a man.
And a dog!

Doggy down! We've got a situation!
What are you doing!

Calling for backup!
Didn't you hear what the kids said?

We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.

And this is no situation,
it's just a couple of tater tops
hot up on to many pixiesticks.

I bet you that dead dog would beg to differ.
What was that!?

Nothing.

Time's up, peewees!
It's Halloween, and believe it or not -
we got things to do.

Wait, you can't...
this thing, it has a mouth
and it comes out and grabs things-

-and pulls them in and eats them.
Yeah, like this...

The thing is, we're trying to make
this sound more real than it normally would.

The problem is it sounds kinda... not real.
So we'll see you later!

Alright, I'll show you!

But if things get out of hand...
We'll aim for Bigfoot!

Quit it!

Smart house...

Hey! You... both of you!
Come here, bring it to the car! Come on!

I'll forget about you throwing that rock,
because that dance was pretty funny.

but the next time any of you mess
with this guys house, all three of you
are going to the hole. - You got it?

Now, I give you ten seconds to march!
But we need your help!
It's your job to help us!

One!... Two!... Three!...

<i>Four!... Five!...</i>

Ouch! It's tender!
My house is right over there!

So much for relying on the government.
I know, I hate the government.
Dude, we're screwed!

No we're not!
We'll go to an expert.

You are looking at the threetime tri-state,
over 14, "Thou Are Dead" champion.

His name is Reginald Skulinski,
but they call him "Skull".

Who's they?
Me and D.J.

He's the smartest guy on earth.

So let us go talk to him.
Wait, Jenny!

Skull is in the gamezone right now.
And you don't want to mess with him
when he's in the gamezone.

Fine, so how long is he gonna
be playing?

Who knows? He once played for
four days straight-

on one quarter, a gallon of
chocolate milk and an adult diaper.

The man's a legend.

Well, if he's not coming out of the
gamezone... then we are going in!

<i>You're gonna die.
You're gonna die!</i>

Did you see that?
I just chopped of your head again.
Your heads rolling, and you can't even see it-

because your eyes are on your head.
Skull?

What?
I'm busy playing a videogame
without even looking at the screen.

What?!
Old man Nebbercrackers house is possessed.

I need to know how to destroy it, before...
Calm down...

You make me wanna throw up in some
tinfoil, and eat it.

Possessed house, you say?

In my travels to the video store and
comic book conventions-

I've seen many strange and
wondrous things.

And I've heard tell of manmade structures
becoming possessed by a human soul-

so that the spirit
becomes merged with wood and brick,
creating a rear form of monster-

-known as Domus Mctippilies.

The house is mr. Nebbercracker?
Why is it murdering its enemies?

Have fun getting killed.

So, how do we kill it?
You've got to strike at the source of life -
the heart.

But houses don't have hearts...

You might be right about that.

Sorry children, but I have got some
very, very important business to take care of.

I won't be seeing you later...

So we need to strike at the heart.
Where are we gonna find
a heart inside a house?

Ever since Nebbercracker died,
there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.

The furnace... the furnace is the heart!
If we wanna put out the fire,
we're gonna have to go inside.

Without getting chewed to pieces.

Dummy!
Hey, I was just doodling...

No, Chowder this is it!
First we build the dummy...

We fill the dummy with
a few gallons of cold medicin.
You can borrow from your dad's pharmacy.

We feed the dummy to the house.
House eats the medicine,
house goes to sleep...

We get in there, put out the fire...
and get out!

Questions?
Yes, are you nuts!?

I don't wanna steal drugs from my father,
I don't wanna to go inside a monster,
and I don't wanna to die!

I think it's worth a shot.
Yes, I agree.
Let's do it!

Hey, but... I wanted that one.
You gotta be kidding me?

Go!

<i>Alright, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
I'm gonna move you into posistion.
Don't be scared...</i>

<i>That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.</i>

Come on!

Trick-or-treat?
Plug it in!

So close...

Littering, loitering,
vandalism, vagrancy...

And treason!
No, not treason.

Alright kids, out of the trashcans. Let's go!
Come on, you heard the big guy.

You see the light, walk towards it.
Keep it movin'.
Alright, drop your weapons-

pass them to me.

I will shoot you!
Well, look what we got here?

Stay here, I'm checking this out.
I am on it!

Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me!? You disrespecting the badge,
you don't want none of this...

<i>I'm telling you... test me, please!</i>

That's it! That is it...
You got something to say, porky?

We're taking 'em in!
That's what I'm talkin' about...
Where are we taking 'em?

To jail! Let's go!
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail...

But officer, you gotta believe us!
Yeah, yeah, yeah two procent...
You got the right to shut up!

Ok.. the house is a monster!
And to think i believed you...

Hey, listen! I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.

I mean, kind of cop. He has a gun...
They're gonna love you downtown, jughead.

We- we are supercops!
Yeah, that's why I live in a condo.

Did you hear that?
Yeah, that's my stomach,
I'm starvin'.

No, no..
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
I'm gonna go check it out!

Jeez! It's like trying to wrangle a puppy.
Right, I'll be back.

<i>No, no...
get out of there!</i>

What?

Superbowl...

<i>Get out!
Stop! Stop!</i>

<i>Where you at,
spooky creature?</i>

Freeze... tree!

You can't do that!
That's a officer's weapon,
that is illegal...

I'm coming buddy!

I'm gonna get back-up!
I thought there was no back-up!

I'm gettin' Judy!

Judy...!

Oh my God... I think I'm having a stroke...
Just try to stay calm. Okay!?
We'll be alright if we just stay calm...

<i>I don't want to die!</i>

<i>Jenny, I've always loved you!</i>

<i>- Chowder!
Sorry.</i>

<i>I can't look!</i>

Guys, run!
Let's go!

We're dead! You killed us! And now we're dead!
Shh, I don't think that the house
knows that we're in here.

I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
Listen! It sounds like it's sleeping...

The only way that we are going
to get out of here alive...
Is if we find the heart, and we put out the fire.

Maybe we should examine our other options.
Sure, other option! We wait here and
do nothing, till it wakes up and eats us!

Find the heart, put out the fire...
Got it!

Explosives!
So cool...

He was watching me...
D.J!

Did you ever see a wife?
People used to say he had one-

-but he battered her up,
and he ate her!

Demolition-squad...

Sorry...
Come on!

Be quiet!
Don't worry, I have a very light step.

There! Right there!
Shoot it!

What!?
I thought if I shot the heart, then...
that is not the heart.

Then, what is it?
Well, if those are the teeth-

-and that's the tongue...
then that must be the uvula.

Oh... so it's a girlhouse?
What?

No!
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.

Not me.

Ok, let's move!

We're gonna move quickly, and quietly...
Don't touch anything!
Let's stay together...

D.J!
Wait...

... I'll save you.

Chowder, knock it off!
sorry, I thought you were...

D.J!
Chowder, it's a toy...

Where's D.J? D.J!
Over here!

Wow... look at all these toys!

This must be where
Nebbercracker kept his stash.

I think you guys should
have a look at this...

<i>Constance - The Giantess</i>

The key!
Come on D.J, we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we got to find a way out of here.

What are you doing?

We have a Ping Pong table in
our basement..

Constance.
Holy moly! He really did eat her.

Couldn't have...
Her whole body is buried in cement.

Look at all this stuff...

Why would he build her a shrine,
if he murdered her?

Maybe he just felt guilty or something...
D.J, can we please get out of here?
Shh..

I always knew you were hiding something,
mr. Nebbercracker.

Let her go, Big Nose!

It's awake!
Run!

Hey! I know that sound...

My ball!
Where are you going?

Chowder, come back!
You get back here...

Got ya!

Killer Slinky!

Leave me alone!

Chowder!

Got you!

D.J, look out!

The uvula!

Growse!
Did we just get up-chucked?

The uvula...
the emergency exit.

That's it!
Another great idea, D.J! Brilliant!
What do you want from me, Chowder?

I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
Do you wanna hear my big idea?

I am going home
to make a pretzel sandwich!
See ya!

Chowder, the house is still alive
and you are going to whuss out?
I risked my life for you-

I stole drugs for you,
and I could have died in there!

Me too!
Yeah, but you're the one that
killed Nebbercracker in the first place!

Getting your stupid ball back!
You guys, stop fighting!
You're acting like babies.

We are babies! What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep
with cold medicin...

How lame can you get?
Where are you going?

I'm going home...
I suck.

D.J!

At least it's an ambulance.

It's a ghost!
Be gone!

Be gone yourself!
Get away!

He's not a ghost! He's not dead...
I'm not a murderer!

Of course I'm not dead!
Who said I was dead?

You'll be dead if you don't scram!

Don't you know what day this is?

I'm running out of time...
I'm running out of time!

Honey... I'm home!

Look at you dear...

Shingles are all ruffled,
the windows are cracked...

But it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
That's her... The house is her!

Come on!
Where are you going?

Mister Nebbercracker!
I know about Constance.

What do you know?
You don't know anything.

You where in my house?

You didn't kill her, did you?

I love her so much...

Hello?

I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?

Yes!

Alright... Okay, open your eyes.
Now it's not much I know, but...

Get away from my house!
I'll rip them to bits!

Constance! What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

Yes, I'm hurt.
They are attacking our house!

They're just kids, dear.
It's Halloween!

No, no, no... it's my house,
and they're hurting me!

Constance, look at me! Look at me!
As long as I'm here I will never
let anyone hurt you.

You vandals, you hooligans! I'll get you!
Constance, no!

<i>So... I finished the house.
She would have wanted that.</i>

<i>She died... but she didn't leave.</i>

<i>That night!
That one night of every year...!</i>

I had to take precautions.
I had to...

I had to!

<i>Stay away from my house!</i>

She attacks anyone who comes near.

I'm coming, dear!
Go!

No wait!
I know how you've been
protecting us all these years -

but now it's our turn to protect you...
Let her go!

But if I let her go... I'll have no-one.
That's not true.

Not so!

Hide!

What are you doing?
Trying to slow the house down!

Come, mr. Nebbercracker. Come on!
Run, run! I can't...

Mr. Nebbercracker, hurry!
Go on! I'll be alright.

Come on!

You stay away from
those children, Constance!

Constance...
Mister Nebbercracker.

My sweet...
You've been a bad girl,
haven't you?

You hurt people.

We've always known this day
would come... haven't we?

I have to make things right.

I have to make things right.

I've always done
what's best for you, haven't I?

Haven't I, girl?

Constance...

Let this be
the right thing to do...

Leave him alone!

Take that!
... and that!

Take this!
You have to help me, please...

I know you can do it!

Go on!

How do you know how to
drive this thing?
I don't!

The chimney!
The chimney leads to the heart...

Jenny! Are you alright?
I'm not sure.

D.J! Get rid of that thing!
I'm working on it.

Chowder! I need you to
get the house down under that crane.

Piece of cake...

You think you can
just mess with my friends!?

Mommy!

<i>Chowder!
Come in, Chowder!</i>

<i>Chowder, buddy?</i>

Hey guys! Look who just won!
It's me... the screw-up!

I'm sorry...
Come on! Yes, look at me...

You can't do that.
It's not fair!

That's it, Chowder!
Keep her coming...

You ain't nothin'! You're a shack!
You're an outhouse!

I can't!
Yes, you can... Go!

I kissed a girl...
I kissed a girl on the lips.

Any time now!

Sorry!

D.J! Hurry!

I'm flying!

On the count of three,
I want you to light the dynamite!
Okay, I got it!

One...! Two...!
Yes!

Three!

Do you guys hear something?

It's over there...
Come on!

<i>My dear... </i>

Bye...

I'm sorry, mr. Nebbercracker,
about your house... and your wife.

Your housewife.

45 years...

We have been trapped for 45 years,
and now...

... we're free!

We're free!
Thank you friend!
Thank you all!

Here you go.
Happy Halloween!

Next!

What happened to Nebbercrackers house?
 It turned into a monster-

-so I blew it up.

Trick-or-treat?
We're gonna need a tricycle!

One tricycle, coming up!
Tricycle...

Hello tricycle! I missed you so much!
Thank you mister!

There's my mom.

So... We should hang out again.
Soon...

Good luck with the puberty!
She grabbed my butt.
That's nice, Chow...

Hey mr. Nebbercracker... it's time to go!
You go on... I got some work to do.

Alright, thanks!
I'll see you around.

Hey... stay off my lawn.

Just kidding.

You think he'll be okay?
Yeah, he'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation -

get some colour,
maybe he'll meet someone new?
This time, maybe a nice beach house?

Hey D.J, look who's here
Yes, I can see that. Thank you.
No biggie!

Hey boys!
Hey dad!

What the heck..?
No don't tell me, let me guess...

Dirty pirates?
That's it! Dirty pirates!

You look adorable...
Have fun tonight!

You know... you're right.

We're definetly to
old for trick-or-treating...

Oh yeah, no question about it.

On the other hand...
we've been working all night...

Candy time?
Candy time...

We're back!
Yes!

Did we just get...?

It's Halloween, right?
What do you say...

... you and I go out
and "inspect" some candy?

We should go eat some candy too.
That's a good idea.

Let's go eat some candy...
Lots of yummy candy!
Like carrots...

Alright, where's the car?

And that is how I
slayed that mystical dragon...

Come on baby, we're out of here.
Not so fast, Bones.

Times have changed...
Skull's not like you.

He gives me the respect I deserve...
and makes time for me.

Whatever...

Bones!
