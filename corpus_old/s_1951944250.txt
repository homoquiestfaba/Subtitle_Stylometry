<i>The word "camera,"</i>
<i>my father once told me...</i>

<i>... came from the Latin word</i>
<i>for "room."</i>

<i>"Each person lives in camera,"</i>
<i>he said...</i>

<i>..."in an isolated room,</i>
<i>full of secrets. "

David, something's definitely
happening.

Honey, no, that's impossible.
First babies are usually late.

Ira. Yeah, it's me.

Her contractions
are four minutes apart.

Okay. Okay, we'll see you there.

He said, go to the clinic.
It's closer than the hospital.

He's gonna call Nurse Gill too.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

You didn't tell me
it would hurt this much.

I swear, I didn't know.

But you're a doctor.
I'm a bone doctor.

Wait, wait, wait. Stop the car.
What, what?

Just think, when we get back,
our lives will never be the same.

May I help you?
I'll take this.

Your wife will be very happy.
When is she due?

I beg your pardon?
Well, this is a maternity robe.

I'm not married.

What? What are you looking at?

You.

Where's Ira?
There was an accident.

He's fine. His car went into a ditch.
He'll be here as soon as possible.

Well, this baby won't wait.
Let's get her inside, then.

Let's get you comfortable.
Here you go.

One side. Very good, okay?

There you go. Just try and relax.

I'm just gonna take
a little look inside.

Everything looks good.
I put her at 10 centimeters.

I delivered five babies
in medical school.

Each one of them a success.

And this one will be too, doctor.

Okay, Norah, I'm gonna give you
some gas. It'll help with the pain.

Here. Breathe in.

"Phoebe."
What's that?

If it's a girl. "Paul," if it's a boy.
Yeah.

Did I tell you that?
I meant to tell you, I decided.

Those are good names.
Phoebe and Paul are great names.

Breathe in, breathe in.
You're doing fine.

God, it's coming fast.
You're doing fine too, doctor.

Just relax.

We're crowning.
Okay, Norah, push.

Push.

God, he's beautiful.

He's beautiful.
I wanna hold him. I wanna see him.

We'll clean him up first,
and then he's all yours.

Doctor?

David? David, is he all right?
Is he all right?

Is everything all right?
He's perfect.

He's perfect.
Absolutely.

Absolutely perfect.

What is that?
Yeah, it's okay.

It's okay. It's just the placenta.
David.

David.
Oh, God. Nurse.

Everything's fine.
What's happening?

Nurse, I need you here right now.
David.

There's another baby.
Give her more gas.

Okay, Norah, breathe deep.
That's it.

That's good, that's good, it's coming.
I can see the head.

It's coming fast.
Okay, Norah, push. Push.

I'll be right back.

It's a girl.

It's a girl. It's a girl.

Hey.

I'm sorry, doctor.

All right. Clean her up, please.
But keep her in the other room.

I don't want my wife to know yet.

David.
Sleep now, sweetheart.

You were incredible.

You're a beauty.

There's a home outside Louisville.
I want you to take her there.

She's a mongoloid.
She won't live long.

Caroline.
But, why?

My sister died when she was 12.
It destroyed my mother's life.

I can't do that to Norah.

Here. It's just off the highway,
about 60 miles.

I'll call ahead.

I can't thank you enough.

<i>Unfortunately, the blizzard will be</i>
<i>continuing throughout the night.</i>

<i>Please stay off the</i> h...

<i>Dr. Henry?</i>

Dr. Henry?

Everyone's gone home.
I think you should be going home too.

Hello?

Stop it. Stop it.

Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.

Billy, stop it. Stop it.

Hold him down.
Now, get me the strap.

Oh, stop it. Calm down, Billy.
Hold this down.

Are you the new nurse?
No, I'm here to...

Did Dr. Henry call?
Who?

A doctor was supposed to call ahead.
He sent me...

We're short-staffed tonight.
Hold his legs down.

If anybody called,
I didn't hear about it.

Billy, if you don't settle down, you're
gonna be in these all day tomorrow.

Do you understand me?
What was that name again?

Dr. Henry.
Okay, wait here. Let me ask Janet.

You better hurry up.
We're closed in 10 minutes.

Come on.

Here we go. Come on, little girl.
That's it. Good girl.

Good, good girl.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Wait, come back.

I have a baby here!

I have a baby here.

Hi.
Hey.

Hi.
You were so brave.

Look at him.

Our beautiful boy, our perf...

Perfect Paul.

What? What is it?

We had twins, honey.

One of each.

Twins?

Where is she?

You know I love you, right?

Right?

Oh, God.

I am so sorry.

She died as she was born.

Did you forget something?

I was trying to get to the phone.
I'm out of gas.

Out of gas?

Listen, lady, at this time,
in this weather, you're also out of luck.

Oh, man.

How old?
Newborn.

Listen, you gotta
come join me in my rig.

I delivered a load of milk.
I'm just waiting out the storm.

Lady, I'm considering that baby.

Name's Al.

Al Simpson.

Caroline Gill.

Oh, I bet you have a story.

Where were you two headed?

Lexington.
Lexington?

Well, if it's only Lexington,
I can give you a lift.

I might as well park the rig there
as here.

If it doesn't put you out.
Oh, hell, no. It's...

Oh, pardon my French.

I mean, Lexington is on my way.

Thank you.

He is perfect, isn't he?

I wanna see her.

Oh, no.
Just for a moment, David. Please.

They took her away.

No.

Morning.

Oh, hi. I hope you...

I hope you don't mind.
I made myself at home.

No, it smells good. I'm hungry.

That's great because,
you know, I made lots.

Thanks.
I talked to a friend of mine.

And he's gonna fill your car with gas
and then drop it off this afternoon.

Why, that's incredibly kind.

Yeah.
It's my infinite pleasure, ma'am.

Thank you.
There you go.

Well, listen,
I've been meaning to say...

...that I'm sorry for whatever happened
with your little girl's...

Well, you know, her father.
Thank you.

I know for a fact
how bad men can behave.

I used to behave
a little bad myself sometimes.

I doubt that.

Anyway, I gotta...
I'm heading back to Pittsburgh.

It's my home between runs, so...
You know Pittsburgh?

No.
Oh, it's a great town.

It's great. You'll...

You should come visit sometime.

Anyway, if you do... Let me...
Let me give you my phone number.

You know, just in case you visit...

...or, you know,
you just wanna talk sometime.

I'm a pretty good listener.

I know that.

Thank you.

Lexington East Clinic.
<i>Hi, Ruby, it's Caroline.</i>

I won't be coming in this afternoon.
I'm coming down with something.

Don't worry. I'll call in Emma.
Hey, did you hear?

Dr. Henry's wife gave birth
to a baby boy last night.

And a little girl who died.

She died?
<i>Yes.</i>

Yes, isn't that awful?

Hi, Kay.
David, honey, I'm so sorry.

We all just rushed over
as soon as we heard.

Thank you.

I just want you to know
that we'll all be there on Tuesday.

What do you mean, "Tuesday"?
We...

We all talked her into it.
We think it's the best thing.

A memorial?
Something small.

Something simple.
It'll help us put her to rest.

Norah, I don't think we need
a public ceremony to do that.

She died, there's no shame in that.
No, of course not.

We need to mark
her presence here on earth.

Whose idea is this?
Your little sewing circle?

Everyone agrees
it's the right thing to do.

Kay called the papers and the church.
It's been arranged.

Why didn't Kay call me?
Why didn't you ask me?

This isn't wrong.
You think this is wrong?

No, Norah...
You touched her.

You held her. At least you held her.

Oh, God.
Caroline.

You told her she died?

Well, I tried to tell her the truth,
but...

I know what it's like to grow up
in a house with a terminally-ill child.

Any joy my mother had in life,
disappeared when my sister was born.

Phoebe only has half a brain.
She'll wind up in a home eventually.

No one raises mongoloids
on their own.

And why do I need
to tell Norah any of this...

...if it's just gonna break her heart?

You mean it's not broken now?

She didn't see the baby.
Someday she'll recover. God willing.

And she never will, knowing
that her daughter's dying in an insti...

I couldn't leave her in that place.

Well, why not?
Why in the world not?

Have you been there?

Oh, God.

Look, do whatever you have to do.
Find a better place for her if you can.

I have the birth certificate.
It's not filled out.

Take this.
I don't want your money.

It's not for you.

Just please, don't tell Norah.
Please don't.

Don't you wanna see her?

The first goodbye was hard enough.

<i>Though little Phoebe's body</i>
<i>rests elsewhere...</i>

...we erect a stone here,
in her memory.

The night is as clear as day.

The darkness and the light
are to thee both alike.

Thou has set our misdeeds
before thee...

...and our secret sins
in the light of thy countenance.

For the things that are seen
are transient.

But the things that are unseen
are eternal.

We have committed her body
to the elements.

Earth to earth...

...ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

The Lord keep her and bless her.

The Lord make his face
to shine upon her...

...and give her peace.

Amen.

Amen.

Excuse me. Is this Caroline Gill's?
3B? Yeah.

She called, donated the stuff,
left town this morning.

To go where?
Didn't say.

Just said, she was starting life over.

<i>Thank you.</i>

David. Thank you.

For today.

For the new father.

I bought it a couple of months ago,
but I forgot about it... Everything.

It's beautiful.

Thanks.

Aren't you gonna take our picture?

The salesman said
it was ready to go.

Are you seeing someone?

What?

You're never home.

And then when you are home,
you're up in that damn darkroom.

Come on, Norah. It's the free clinic.
My patients need me.

I need you.

I miss you.

You never touch me.

I want another child.

David.

It's been six years.

I know.

I'm just not ready yet.

Every child deserves an education.
Order.

Every child deserves an education.

Mrs. Gill.
My daughter is 6 years old.

And, yes, it takes her more time,
it's true, to learn new things.

But she can do anything
that every child her age can do.

She can dress herself.
She can recite the alphabet.

She can count to 50 and...

And yet, according to you...

...she's not allowed
to attend public school.

Mrs. Gill...
And she's not alone.

Every parent here has a child like her.
Your passion is admirable, Mrs. Gill.

But the bottom line is,
these are mongoloid...

We don't call them mongoloids!
They're not mongoloids.

If we accede to your demands...

...overnight we'd have
a flood of retarded individuals.

It's now called, Down syndrome.

These children are not stupid.
They can do everything that...

But are they capable
of mastering academic skills?

Why not teach them
a productive and useful trade?

Phoebe is 6 years old.
She doesn't need a trade.

Order, please. Sit down, sit down.

One at a time, please. One at a time.

In you get, sweetie.

There you go.
So who put on your nightgown?

Daddy.

Daddy. Okay.

So, what do you
wanna hear tonight?

Funny Bunny.

Are you sure? All right.

But if I forget something,
you're gonna have to help me.

Okay.

Once there was a little bunny
who was perfect in every way...

...except she wasn't like
every other bunny.

And when she went for a walk...

...the other bunnies
would sometimes call her?

Funny Bunny.
Yeah.

And how did that make her feel?

Sad.
Sad.

So, what did she do?
She went home to Mommy Bunny.

She went home to Mommy Bunny.

And Mommy Bunny
took her in her paws and said:

"Everything is different.

No two flowers are the same,
no two butterflies...

...and no two bunnies.

And that is why I love you."

You're not my Funny Bunny.

You're my Honey Bunny.
Honey Bunny.

You ready to go to sleep?
Okay. Let's take your glasses off.

Good girl. Okay.

How was tonight?
Oh, don't ask.

How was Atlanta?

Why don't you want him
to know where we live?

Because I'm afraid
he'll take her back.

Over my dead body.

Come here.

Come on.

Come here.

Let me show you some dance moves
I was working on with Phoebe.

Only a little closer.
Oh, yeah?

I've never done
anything like this before.

I'll have a lot more time on my hands
once Paul starts the 1 st grade.

Well, my husband's
never at home, so...

Well, he's a very busy doctor.

Well, I only need someone part-time.
But you're certainly pretty enough.

I'm talking to another girl tomorrow.

I'll let you know after the holiday.
How's that?

Well, I promise you won't regret it.

Hi, Mom.

Hi, baby.

Isn't she the cutest?

I keep telling her, I say, "Elizabeth,
hon, you are the cutest thing."

I hope it doesn't go to her head.

Like a little tomato juice
with your vodka?

It's a party. You need to be
a little more adventurous.

Like this.
Kay.

If I had legs like yours,
I would be living in miniskirts.

Especially if I was married to David.

He's so hot, I'm surprised
you're not bowlegged.

Kay.

Let me see you goof around.
Sort of like you're about to fall off.

Hey, Mom, look at me. Look at me.

Paul.

You get down from there.
Get down right now.

He's a kid. He'll be fine.

Don't encourage him, David.
Stop taking pictures.

We're throwing a party.
Come on.

You can't just hide behind a camera.
Nobody minds.

I do. It's rude.

I organized everything,
I made all the food.

The least you could do...
Help.

Help.

Paul, stop. Stop it.
Get down this instant.

Ease up, Norah.

And put away the damn camera.
I'm sorry I ever gave it to you.

Maybe lighten up a little
on the liquor, shall we?

I can't stay up here.

Stop.

Oh, it's all right. You'll be fine.

Are you all right?

You look a little bruised.

She's just on one of her things.
I never know what sets her off.

Kay. I told you I can't.

Paul.

Paul.

Paul? Paul.

It really hurts.
Show me where.

Is it broken?
It could be.

You said nothing would happen
and he broke his arm.

Yeah.
It could've been his neck.

Well, it wasn't, was it?
Or his back.

Just stop it, Norah, please.
Just stop it.

<i>Just stop it, Norah, please.</i>
<i>Just stop it.</i>

<i>Stop it. Stop it.</i>

You're so good to me.

How do I rate this?

You're a wonderful husband
and I'm a terrible nagging wife.

No.

Hey, where were you? There was a
phone call. Something about a job?

Did I get it? I got it?

Did I? I got it? Oh, is it okay?

I'll be a better mother,
a perfect wife. Please.

Well, sure.
Whatever you want, yeah.

What's in there? Is that where
you keep your dirty pictures?

That's just insurance papers.
Hey, I'm almost done in here.

Why don't you get ready for bed
and I'll be right over?

Okay.

Don't be long.

Like that.

Hold still.
It's hot.

That's it. Wait.

Here.

That's good. There.

Yeah.

Yeah, like that.

That's it.

Yeah, like that. Wait.

That's it.
I don't get it.

Why take a picture of me at all if you
want me to disappear into the dunes?

It's about perception, honey.

About hiding things in plain sight.
We're almost done.

That's a nice camera.
Thanks.

You mind if I?

Oh, sure.
Thanks.

You a photographer?
Little bit.

Oh, that's a cool shot.
Yeah.

Yeah, I use it a little bit in my work.

What work is that?
I'm an artist.

So you take pictures and then draw?
No, not exactly.

I use a camera obscura.

I didn't think they still made those.
They don't.

I made it myself. It's beautiful.

That's impressive.
Thank you.

My name's David, by the way.
Hi.

I'm Howard.
Nice to meet you.

How long are you folks down here?
Because I'd love to show it to you.

We've got another week. Norah here,
is the queen of travel agents.

We're here because of all of her
hard work. How about yourself?

I'm gonna be here all summer.

I'm kind of in the middle
of a messy divorce.

That's too bad.
Yeah.

Well, maybe you'll come with us
to dinner?

Does that sound okay, hon?
Sure.

Yeah. Come to dinner.

Thank you.

I've never seen anything like it.

It started when Paul broke his arm.
First it was the x-rays.

And then I went into the operating
theater with a telephoto lens.

What do you think that is?

It's not a tree?
Well, actually, it's the human heart.

Here you go.
Thanks.

That was amazing, Paul.
You are amazing.

Thanks.

Got a lot of amazing talent
in this house, David.

Thank you.

I can't wait to see what you do.

It's a mahogany box that seals out
all light except for a tiny pinpoint...

...which focuses whatever image
you're aimed at, onto a screen inside.

Right.
A lot of famous painters used it.

Vermeer. Da Vinci, perhaps.
Boy, I'd love to see that.

Paul and I are going
deep-sea fishing tomorrow.

But maybe the next day.
Sure, anytime.

Though, I am in
all tomorrow morning, Norah.

Perhaps you'd like
to come and see it.

Perhaps I could even draw you.
We'll see.

Paul. Paul, wake up.

Paul. It's time to go.
Don't wake your mom.

Well, you heard what he said, right?
He said I was amazing.

Which you are. I just don't think
you should shut doors.

Juilliard is opening doors,
not closing them.

It's a dream. It's not reality.
You don't think I'm good enough?

I don't think you can make
a solid living as a musician.

What if I'm the next Segovia?
What if I have it in me...?

What if you find the cure
for an awful disease?

That is your dream, not mine.
That may be. But it's not something...

You think music is less important
than science? What do you know?

You know what, screw you.
You don't know a damn thing.

Paul.
Come on, move your damn car!

Move it!
Paul!

Come on.
Okay.

Move it!

Go.

Phoebe, sweetie, what is it?
Time for breakfast, Mom.

Okay, we'll be right down.

Why are you two so lazy today?

Well, should we tell her?
Tell me what?

It's a surprise.
We'll tell you over breakfast.

Surprise.

Oh, honey, that's so nice.
Thank you, sweetie.

Oh, sweetie.

And you made me a card. Look.

I did. I said, yes. Come here.

Yes, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you so much.

Well, will you be our flower girl?
Yeah.

Oh, man. This place is so cool.

He comes here when
he doesn't wanna be with us...

...which is pretty much all the time.
He took all these pictures?

Most of them, yeah.
He's such an ass.

He wants my music
to become a hobby like this.

He wants me to become a doctor.
Dude, that sucks.

Is that your mom?

Yeah.
Nice.

What does she say?
She's got her own problems.

I don't even know
why they're still married.

Their marriage sucks.
Join the club.

Did you do that?

Yeah, when I was a kid.
Who's "Feebee"?

She's my twin sister.

She died when we were born.
Cool.

Hey, hey, hey. Lighten up. What are
you doing? Your dad will kill you.

I don't care. Do you think I care?
Screw him.

Hi, Mom.

He wants to meet her.
What?

The latest letter you brought me...

...he says, what he did was a mistake
and he wants to know where we live.

What do you think?

He wants to take her from us, Al.

I doubt that.

I can't risk it.

Well, he'll have to get past me first.

Come on, let's go to bed.

Okay, buddy. Here we go.

You are not getting any lighter.

Dad?

I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

I just kind of lost it.

I can make it up.
Just tell me what you want.

Hold this.

That's you and your sister, huh?

June.

How did she die again?

She was born
with a hole in her heart.

It was just a matter of time.

<i>Oh, hello, yes. I'd like to speak</i>
<i>to the congressman, please.</i>

<i>My name's Caroline Gill.</i>
<i>Yeah, it's about Down syndrome.</i>

You know what they told us today?
What?

Finally, you're allowed
to attend public school.

Great, just when you graduate.
Great.

Outstanding work.
Thank you.

Thank you, and my greatest thanks
to Dr. Salter...

...and the Winsley Gallery
of Pittsburgh, for supporting my work.

I'm a doctor. I understand science.

But I'm afraid I'm fairly inarticulate
when it comes to art.

My son calls me,
"a boring medical egghead."

Which I no longer dispute.

"In camera" means,
more or less, "in secret."

And I think photography
does the exact opposite.

I think it reveals what is hidden.

But I look at these photographs and
I have no idea where they came from.

How can one live without theory? I see
the passion but I don't see the point.

I don't know what I was thinking...
David?

Have I changed that much?

Do you two know each other?

Yes, we do. Excuse us a moment.

Good God, Caroline.
You live here in Pittsburgh?

I looked all over for you.

Atlanta, Cleveland, all those places
you had me send letters.

My husband's
a long-distance trucker.

He'd pick them up
and bring them back to me.

You're married.

Yes.

And Phoebe? Is she still with you?

Of course.

I came to your apartment that day
after the service. You'd already left.

Were you coming to take her back?

I don't know.

I just wanted to see her.

No.

You just wanted to make sure
that I wouldn't tell.

All those years you sent nothing
but little notes and lots of money.

You never asked about her. Or me.

Then out of the blue,
I get some long rambling letter...

...about how you want her
back in your life.

Did you really think that
I was gonna let you take her away?

That was never my intention.
You didn't intend any of this?

Yes?
Dr. Henry, is everything okay?

I'll be right out.

Look, please,
I don't have to tell her who I am.

I wanna meet her. She's 18.

Why would I even let you near her?
I just wanna know if she's okay.

Is her health okay?
She's fine, her heart is fine.

Which is not what you predicted.

She's bright and happy,
which is not what you predicted.

She loves to sing.

She's learning to weave.

You missed a lot of heartache, David,
but you also missed a lot of joy.

Why did you even come here
if you're not gonna let me see her?

I don't know.

I wanted you out of my head.

It's over now.

I was in love with you.

What are you even saying?

What did I ever do
to encourage that?

Nothing.

Everything.

I was wrong,
I shouldn't have come here.

Wait.

Wait.

Dr. Henry, I'd like you to meet one of
our biggest patrons, a fan...

These past 40 years, he's...
I'm sorry, would you excuse me?

<i>Hi, this is the</i>
<i>Lindstedt Detective Agency.</i>

<i>No one's here now,</i>
<i>but leave a message...</i>

<i>... and we'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

My name is Dr. David Henry.

I'd like to hire you to find someone,
a woman who lives in Pittsburgh.

There's a terrific cruise
that leaves for Alaska mid-June...

...so you'll be there
during the solstice.

I took it myself two years ago,
and it was amazing.

I'll be right with you.

I can get you a cabin with a view
and you won't believe...

Mom?

Hello.
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

I'm still in Pittsburgh.
It's gonna take me a few more days.

Is everything all right?

Yeah, everything's fine.
How about with you?

Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, God, I overslept. Bye.

Paul.

Hello.

I told you not to call me here.

<i>I have to see you again.</i>
I can't, it's crazy today.

<i>When's David get back?</i>
I don't know.

<i>Sam, listen, I can't...</i>

<i>Norah?</i>
Oh, God.

Paul. Paul.

Paul. Paul.

Paul.

Did you talk to him?

No, but he's very nice.
He took my picture.

Without asking?
He was on the other side of the street.

Phoebe, how many times
have I told you not to talk...?

"Do not talk to strangers."
I know, I didn't talk.

You worry too much.

Phoebe, we worry because there are
people out there who would hurt you.

You treat me like I'm a little girl.

I'm a grownup now,
I can look out for myself.

Phoebe?

Go away, go away.

You're a bad man.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

Any word?
No.

You call the police?

The police won't do anything
until he's been missing for 48 hours.

Did you call the school, his friends?
I'm not stupid.

Why did he do this?
I don't know, I told...

One minute he's having breakfast,
then he's storming out?

He doesn't have his wallet,
he doesn't have money.

He won't get very far
before he runs out of gas.

Maybe if you'd been here.
Oh, now it's my fault?

I'm not talking about Pittsburgh.
I'm talking about him.

I'm talking about "been here for him."
I've been here for him.

We used to go fishing,
play basketball. Come on.

He hates basketball.
He hasn't been fishing for years.

You never supported
what he wanted.

He left because I wanted him
to have a good education?

He wants to be a musician.
He's a teenager. They all want...

I'm trying to give him
everything I never had.

Yes, and he hates you for that.
He'll come around.

No, he won't, we've lost him, okay?

We've lost him, he's the only child
we have and it's too damn late.

And I need to go to the office.

If you'll man the phones,
I need the keys.

Maybe if we go into counseling,
as a family.

It's too late for me too, David.
It's too late.

Hello.

Dad?

Are these really necessary?

I mean, he's not a criminal.
He stole some cheese.

I was hungry.

Paul, sweetie.
Thank God you're safe.

Is he going to jail?

The supermarket where he shoplifted
has agreed not to press charges.

Fine, great. He's grounded.

Mom, I have to rehearse.
I have a concert in a week.

You can't just do what you did
and expect things to go on as usual.

Oh, really?

Okay, fine. Then I'm not going home.
I'd rather go to jail, I'd rather be dead.

You don't mean that.
You wanna bet?

I am sick of you.

Miss.

All right.

Why?

I applied to Juilliard
without you knowing it.

Duke drove me down to Chicago
last month so I could audition.

And I got accepted.
Good.

Good for you.

I thought you'd be pissed.

If it's what you want,
go and be happy.

I'm proud of you, son.

Mom's got a boyfriend.

I know.

He's not the first, Dad.

You're not coming in?
I won't be long.

Where are you going?
No place you'd wanna come.

Robert, Phoebe, that's enough.

It's okay, Phoebe's my girlfriend.

We love each other.
You kiss someone you love.

That's true,
but that looked like more than kissing.

Mom, we're getting married.

What? No, you're not.

Why not?

Because it's complicated.

Where would you live?
Here.

Oh, Phoebe.
We'll buy a house.

With what? How will you afford it?

I have a job. So does Phoebe.

We're gonna get married
and have lots of babies.

Babies are an awful lot of work.

And, Phoebe, you can't keep a job
if you're watching babies.

I love Robert, and Robert loves me.
Why can't we get married?

Oh, honey.
It's not fair.

I know, I know it's not fair.
So much in life isn't fair.

We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Come on, let's finish getting dressed.

Why can't it be simple?
Maybe it is simple.

Maybe she needs
to move into a group home.

She is not ready
to go out in the world.

And she certainly can't get married.

I mean, what if she got pregnant?
I don't wanna raise another child.

Look, ever since I met you...

...you've been demanding
that the world not slam doors on her.

Why can't she move out?

Why not let her try?

Because...

...I can't let her go.

I can't imagine my life without her.

Come on, we're gonna be late.

Come, Mom. Let's sit up front.
Come, Robert.

Oh, I don't know, honey.

It's open seating. Why not?

He's not gonna recognize her.

There you go, Tabitha.

How's that feel?
Okay.

All your friends are gonna sign
their names and draw pictures on it.

Doctor, Paul called.

Oh, excuse me.
Oh, he couldn't talk.

He just wanted to remind you
that today is Norah's birthday.

Hi.

What could I get you
that you don't have?

<i>How about a trip?</i>
<i>I know a great travel agent.</i>

Well, you could do me a favor.
Well, two, really.

I'll do my best. Shoot.

You know Frederick and I are getting
married and moving to France?

Yeah, I heard.
<i>Well, we're gonna sell the house.</i>

You could clean out that darkroom...

...like you've been promising
for the last three years.

Yeah, sure.

If you wanna be sweet, get someone
to fix that drip under the kitchen sink.

It's gotten worse,
and the plumber's on vacation.

How old are you, Norah?

Forty-six.
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

Because I'd only do a favor like that
for someone turning 46.

Thanks. It was good of you to call.

Bye.

<i>Hey, Mom. Just wanted</i>
<i>to wish you happy birthday.</i>

<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

<i>Happy birthday.</i>

<i>I love you so much,</i>
<i>and I count the days until we marry.</i>

David.

David?

David?

To Carrie?
Great show last night, man.

You were terrific.
Thanks.

Backstage.

Hey, Mom, what's up?
Did you get my message?

I called to wish you happy birthday.
<i>Paul, Paul.</i>

It's your father.

I asked him to fix the drip
in the kitchen sink.

And I came home
to find him collapsed on the floor.

What happened?
<i>Oh, they think it was an aneurysm.</i>

Something he'd been carrying
his entire life...

...without anyone knowing it,
and today, it just broke.

What do you mean?
Is he gonna be all right?

Paul.

Paul, he's dead.

You guys looked happy.

We were.

Look at these.
I forgot how cute you were.

"Were"?

You ought to use that
for your concert poster.

Yeah, right, Mom.
Why not?

What's this?
There's hundreds of them.

Who are these?

I haven't a clue.

They're all different too.

So someone's actually
gonna buy all these?

Museums are interested.

A few dealers too.
Really?

I'd like this one.

Of course.
He'd want you to have that.

You can have this too.

If you want.

Thanks, Mom.

This must be to the locked files.

Why did he lockup
his insurance files?

Who is this?

She looks familiar.

It's weird though.
They're all of the same girl.

I don't get it. He never had
a Polaroid camera, did he?

Who is that?

Mom, who's C. Gill?

Mom?

Bastard!

Bastard.

I was thinking.

You know
that box of pictures of girls?

We didn't know who they were?

I think that those are pictures
that he took of girls.

Perfect girls growing up.

Just like he took pictures of me.

He missed her too, Mom.

He lost a daughter too. Just like you.

I found an address.

Among his things.

She's in Pittsburgh, Mom.

She's in Pittsburgh.

Caroline Gill.

We found your letters
in David's office.

He died over a week ago.

Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Mom.

Mom, I got a surprise.

Come on, come over.

Come, come over here.

I didn't pick them.
I bought them with my own money.

Happy Mother's Day.

Oh, thank you, sweetie.

Come here.

Hello.
Hello, Phoebe.

Who are you?

She's your mom, sweetheart.

No, she's not. You're my mom.

Why are you crying? Are you okay?

I know I'm your mom.

And I always will be,
but you grew in Norah's tummy...

...before you came to live with me.

I didn't tell you when you were little,
because I didn't want to confuse you.

And I wanted you to know...

...that I love you more than anything
or anyone. Okay?

But you're old enough now
to understand, okay?

Okay, come here.

Hey, I know you. I saw you play.
You're very good.

Thanks.

What are you doing here?

This is your brother, Phoebe.

Your twin brother, Paul.

Wow, very nice to meet you.

It's very nice to meet you too.

Why don't we all go inside?

Phoebe made some iced tea
this morning, didn't you?

Yeah, and it's not from a mix.
It's the real thing.

Happy Mother's Day.

Wanna see my room, Paul?
I like music too.

I got a new record player.
I got it from Robert.

Who's Robert?
My boyfriend.

He thinks we should get married.
But I don't think that's a good idea.

He didn't...

He thought...

People thought, you know,
babies like Phoebe, they...

He thought she wouldn't live.

He was doing
what he thought was best.

You make mistakes...

...and then you try and fix them
and you move on.

He didn't make... He couldn't, but...

And I wanted
Phoebe to...

Please.
