Fuck this shit!

Let's go home.

<i>Regret and remorse.</i>

<i>Amends and atonement,
that's life right?</i>

<i>But this next one is for you.</i>

<i>All you lost souls racing down
that long road to redemption,</i>

<i>and all you sinners running
from your past,</i>

<i>but heading straight into that
bitter darkness up ahead.</i>

<i>We're all on that same
endless highway.</i>

<i>The one with no name
and no exits.</i>

<i>Looking for a way out of
tonight and into tomorrow.</i>

<i>Well, they gonna
try to stop you,</i>

<i>but you got to say
"Fuck it" and keep moving.</i>

<i>Because this is your highway.</i>

<i>And tonight might
just be the night</i>

you finally out run
those wicked demons,

<i>once in for all.</i>

<i>And I'll be right here with you
making sure you get where you're going.</i>

What's up?

Nothing.

Don't worry, we're fine.

It's customer's only.

Hey!

Read the sign.

Twenty on the truck.

Rough night?

Yeah.

Have a nice day.

Mich, let's get
the fuck out of here.

Come on!

Come again soon.

Fuck!

What the fuck?

What the fuck?

Rough night?

What the fuck?

There's gotta be a way out.

What if there's not?

Pullover.

-What?
-Pullover.

Are you crazy?

What you gonna do?

I'm not running.

Mich!

Mich!

Hey!

Hey!

I know we've had a
pretty fucked up day,

but if you can keep it together for
a little bit longer that'll be great.

Why? What are
we running to?

What?

So we get out of here
and go home and then what?

And then nothing we're home,
that's the point. Back to normal.

Exactly.

Mich.

You wanted this.

We did this for you, we
did this for Catherine.

So get in the fucking truck!

I'm not asking
you to stay.

You've lost it, man.

You want to stay
here and get killed?

I'll see you around.

Jack, come on.

What do you want?

I think you've figured it out,
they've come to collect.

There's no way out,
we've fucked up!

You know what, Mich, fuck you!

I'm going home.

Jack!

Dad.

Catherine?

Dad why
won't you help me?

Catherine!

Dad help me!

Catherine!

Help!

Dad!

Catherine!

Catherine!

Catherine! Fuck!

It's piercing my brain.

My God, it's one o'clock.

Guys we got to go.

Ava, get up.

I've never been so
hungover in like...

You guys got everything?

It's to early for this!

Southbound baby.

<i>...goin' on down
that road and each</i>

<i>time hold on and
don't ever let go.</i>

Yeo!

Hannah.

Whoa!

Man, this thing is fucked.

Of course, the one day we can't
afford to stop, we get a flat.

It would be fine if your drum kit
didn't have to take up so much space.

But it wasn't my idea to take
out the spare tire, Kimberly.

Whatever, I'll just call triple
A, can you hand me my bag?

Nope.

Do you even know where we are?

GPS can't even find
us on my phone.

No we're not on a private road.

We're in the middle of the
state highway right now.

Why is it so hot?

<i>...we can't help you.</i>

Well, yeah. Thanks for nothing.

The closest place is
four hours from here.

And it's closed.

-Why?
-It's so early.

The chick on the phone sounded
like she was at a bar.

Which reminds me.

Wait, you're not serious, Kim.

What? It's not like
we going anywhere.

Warm beer.

Guys, car!

Great! I was seriously thinking
who I'll have to eat first,

see you by the way.

Youngest.

Can we offer
you a ride?

Is there a town close by? Triple
A says there's nothing for miles.

No we are pretty far out. Actually
closest town is quite a way south.

You would wanna go
to Pete's auto body.

Okay.

Talk to Pete.

He's not gonna be there
until tomorrow, though.

Why don't you come to our place?
Just until we can get hold of Pete.

Thanks a lot really, but we're good.
We're used to sleeping in the van.

You know, Betty,

I wonder if the camper at Kensington
has the same size tire as the van?

Sure they have a spare.

Bet the boys could
fix it right up.

Yeah! I guess
maybe we could.

No, we're good, thank
you, though. Really.

Well, suit yourselves.

Goodbye.

Wait!

What? What are you doing?

We don't know where we are.
We haven't seen...

This is not a good idea, to
go with those complete weirdos.

Look at us, look at them.
We're the weirdos.

I'd rather go with them than
with a bunch of rappie dudes.

So are you girls
students?

No, we're not,
we are in a band.

Fun, a rock and roll group.

-Yup.
-We play jazz.

Smooth jazz.

I do love jazz.

So, how long have you
guys lived out here?

I don't know,
since the war.

Is that a trap
or something?

It probably was,
but broken now.

Phonies.

This is your fault, okay?

All right then.

You don't have to worry about locking
it up, there's no one around for miles.

Come on.

Here we are, the bathroom's
right there. Nap, shower,

anything that you need to do.

The Kensington's are going to be
coming over for supper.

It's just so wonderful
to have some company.

I'm sorry about Alex.

What did you just say?

It's so wonderful to have
some company.

No, before that.

-I will whip up some supper for us.
-Thank you.

What the fuck!

They aren't old right? They act like
they're eighty and from the fifties.

Bet they have the nastiest sex.

Wait.

Did you guys hear that?

What are you talking about?

Kim, this totally
looks like you.

You like a hot milk maid.

They definitely have
the nastiest sex.

My cousin is a Sunday school
teacher and she loves anal.

I really don't think
I'm hearing things.

You're so gross.

You started it.

This bed is like
a freaking cloud.

I don't think it's a good idea
for us to take a nap here, Ava.

Hey, you totally had
sex with that old guy

just because he had a
Tempur-Pedic mattress.

Okay, he wasn't old.

Old.

He was pretty old.

He was 49, that's not old.

-That's so old.
-That's old even for me.

Stop talking to me.

She's done it again.

This is beautiful.

Just beautiful.

How lucky we are that you have access
to these old family recipe's, Betty.

So, you guys have a tire?

For the van! Yes, sure, the boys will
fix that up for you. Wont you, boys?

Sorry, are these your son's?

You look so young.

You just made Betty's
year with that one.

Actually we adopted the boys,

it's a long sad story.

Let's give thanks.

Divine one,

we offer our gratitude
for this beast.

For this blood.

For these vessels of a new.

We bow to you,

for you all knowing.

We offer ourselves to you.

For you are the master.

Amen.

Um, what exactly
is in this dish?

It's a Sunday roast.

I probably should have mentioned
before that I don't eat meat.

I see.

You know there are some who just
don't have the luxury to not eat meat.

Only the strong survive,
right, boys?

So you guys Russian
or something?

Russian? That is a good one.

No.

Raymond and Betty their
just very traditional.

Set in their ways, as are we.

But it is no matter,
everything is fine,

you don't have to
eat the meat.

It's actually really good.

It is.

I thought there was four of you.

Enough.

This place feels like
a bad acid trip.

Those twins.

What the fuck was that
prayer all about?

Why do you have be so negative?

Seriously?

Yeah!

So we got a flat.

What the fuck!

We're here.

With a roof over our head,
we got free dinner.

What's the big deal?

Why can't you just make
the best of things.

I don't know, cause we have
a show to play tomorrow.

And we're stuck
in some house,

in the middle of nowhere, on some
road that doesn't seem to exist.

Sorry if I'm being a bummer
by pointing this out,

but this isn't exactly normal.

Nothing's ever your fault.

-What?
-Nothing.

Just...

miss Alex that's all.

If she were here everything
would've been different.

Yeah, so do I, obviously.

Then why did you
let her leave?

What did you say?

You let her leave that night.

You wanted to fuck some...

nobody asshole in some...

shit hole club.

I hope it was good.

I hope it was really good.

Why are you doing
this right now?

You know that I loved
her more than anything.

It's not funny, Kim.

You should see your
face right now.

What the fuck, man,
that's so messed up.

I didn't make her leave that
night, it's not my responsibility...

My God! My God!

Okay, I'm gonna get you towel.

Jesus!

Hey! They're really sick.

Ava and Kim can't stop
throwing up

this black stuff all over the
place. We have to do something.

Dear.

It's probably the meat.

Newcomers.

Well, the first time
is the worst time.

What is in that meat?
What is going on?

I got just the thing.

They'll be fine as soon as
they get some medicine.

Nice play.

Thank you so much.

This medicine is wonderful.

Of course, darling.

See? All better now.

Are you sure you don't want to change
into something more comfortable?

Yeah, I'm sure, thank you.

Shouldn't we be calling
a doctor, though?

Don't you worry, Dale
knows what he's doing.

Old family recipe.

Yeah, from
the old world?

Yes, young lady,
from the old world.

But I swear if I could
market this I'd be rich.

Sleep tight.

-Guys we have got to go.
-You need to calm down.

Let's just get some sleep.

Some peace, while the boys
can come fix our van.

What? No. We go take their
tire and we get on the road.

I will pay for a hotel.

I'm not going anywhere.

How do we even get
to the van tonight?

I'm going to bed.

I'm so, so sleepy.

How are you guys acting like
nothing is wrong right now?

I wish Alex was here.

I know. Me too.

But she's dead.

I wish Sadie was a
better friend to Alex.

I have more faith
in you than that.

Why did you leave me here?

My God.

Let us rejoice.

Let us rejoice.

Hear now his creed.

Contentment thou shall find,
through suffering.

And through long years in it.

For the damned
do not grow old.

Their minds
are nourished.

Are living in the dark
waters of the Gods.

Know us now.

Thou has begun my transition.

Thou has begun my transition.

Thou has begun my transition.

Thou has begun my transition.

Thou has begun my transition.

Damned do not grow old.

Thou has begun my transition.

Damned!

Do not grow old.

Thou has begun my transition.

Thou has begun my transition.

Thou has begun my transition.

Don't be a baby.

You left me there to die.

Now we can all be together.

Hey!

<i>-Black.
-Black, pink, black.</i>

I like pink, go with pink.

<i>-Of course you do.
-You look great in it.</i>

You want to wear
the black I know.

<i>Of course I want
to wear the black.</i>

I...

<i>Yeah, where were we?</i>

<i>Lucas, what just happened?</i>

<i>Seems I've lost my
train of thought.</i>

<i>Lucas?</i>

<i>Lucas, you okay?</i>

I gotta call you back.

Hello? Hey! Are you okay?

Miss I...

<i>-Hey.
-Lucas, you okay?</i>

Yeah.

<i>Damn it! Don't do
that to me all I heard</i>

<i>was this god-awful
screeching sound,</i>

<i>I thought you're being attacked
or something.</i>

<i>You need to come early.
When are you coming home?</i>

<i>Baby? Talk to me.</i>

<i>Lucas?</i>

<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

Honey, I've got to call
you back, okay. I'm sorry.

I love you.

<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

I just hit a woman with my car.

<i>You just hit a woman with
your car. Was she on foot?</i>

Yeah, she's in this road right
now, she's very badly hurt.

She's very badly hurt.

<i>Okay we got it. Where
are you right now?</i>

I'm on... I'm on...
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

<i>Sir, sorry, you're breaking up.</i>

I said, I'm in the middle
of nowhere!

What do I do?

<i>Okay, sir, I can't send an ambulance
if I don't know where you are.</i>

<i>Is there a cross street?</i>

No, there's... Um, there
is some lights up ahead.

I think there is a town
a few miles ahead.

<i>Okay, so there's a town. Can you
tell me anything about where that...</i>

I can't find it on
my GPS, I'm sorry.

<i>Okay, I'm passing you to
emergency medical, one moment.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

Hello, can you
hurry up please?

<i>-Sir it's okay, are you there?
-Yes I'm here.</i>

<i>I'm the certified EMT,
are you with her now?</i>

<i>Yup.</i>

<i>Great, describe her
condition to me.</i>

She's got a headed trauma

and some broken bones.

<i>-Multiple broken bones I think.
-Okay, anything else?</i>

She's got a compound
fracture of her knee. I think.

<i>-Is she's breathing?
-Yup.</i>

<i>-Is she conscious?
-I can't be clear.</i>

<i>-You're doing fine.
-Sir? Lucas?</i>

Yeah.

<i>-Lucas?
-How do you know my name?</i>

<i>We have your cell.</i>

<i>-Right, of course.
-You need to trust us, okay?</i>

Okay.

<i>She's in critical condition
and we can't seem to locate you</i>

<i>so we like you to try
and move her.</i>

<i>You want me to move her?</i>

<i>You said there's a
town up ahead, right?</i>

All right, okay.
You're okay.

Okay, I got her in the back
seat, we're are driving.

I'm heading south.

Are you still with me?
Can you hear me?

<i>Yeah we're here just
stay with us, okay?</i>

<i>You're doing just great, Lucas.</i>

There's a lot of cracks in the
windshield, I cannot see very well.

What I am looking for
when I get there?

<i>-We're gonna talk you through it.
-All right, good.</i>

I'm doing about 80 right now, I think
I can go faster, I'm gonna go faster.

<i>Lucas? You need to
say something to her.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>You know, in case
she can hear you.</i>

I'll do everything I can.

<i>Lucas, tell us when
you're close.</i>

Okay, just got into town.

There's shops, I see a barber shop. I
see there's a tattoo parlor, a church.

<i>Do you see any people?</i>

<i>Anyone on the side of the road?
Anyone you can ask for help?</i>

No, I don't see anyone,
there's nobody.

<i>What about on coming traffic?</i>

<i>Can you flash your lights
at the on coming traffic?</i>

No, I don't see anyone.

<i>There's no on coming traffic?
Or there's no people?</i>

Okay, wait a minute.

Okay, there's a sign up here.

It's a hospital sign, I think I'm
pulling up into a local hospital.

<i>Dispatch to vehicle. He's located
a medical facility of some sort.</i>

<i>Be advised, no contact.
Local PD.</i>

<i>Lucas we'll stay with you
till you've made contact.</i>

<i>Just make sure you stay
with us until then.</i>

Help! I need some help!

Hello?

Hello, I've an emergency.

Is there anybody here?

<i>Sir, is there some sort
of a problem?</i>

<i>Did you run into a problem?</i>

<i>-Hello?
-Sir, is there a problem?</i>

<i>Lucas? Lucas, can you...</i>

What the fuck!

Hey!

<i>Sir, what's the problem here?</i>

<i>-We need you to talk to us.
-'Cause we can help.</i>

<i>Sir?</i>

<i>Sir, we need you on the line,
telling us what you see,</i>

<i>we need you to
keep talking to us.</i>

<i>-Sir?
-There's no one here.</i>

<i>-It's abandoned or something.
-Okay, calm down, sir.</i>

Is no one fucking here?

<i>Sir, I need you to calm down,
I'm sure there's someone near by.</i>

<i>I'm gonna need you to find the nearest
surgeon, nurse, who ever you can find.</i>

<i>-I need you to find the closest person.
-There is no one here.</i>

You understand?

I'm looking,
I do not see anyone.

<i>Okay, how is the victim?</i>

<i>-How is the victim?
-I don't know what's happening.</i>

<i>Lucas, what about the girl?
How is she doing?</i>

Shit. Fuck. No.

<i>-Lucas how is she doing?
-Not good.</i>

<i>Okay, what's happening?</i>

Her leg is, is broken.

She's bleeding really,
really bad.

<i>All right. Focus.</i>

<i>Need to stop the bleeding. I need
you to look for anything you can use.</i>

<i>-Like a tourniquet?
-Yes.</i>

All right, I got it.

<i>Okay, now wrap it
around her leg.</i>

All right,
how tight do I make it?

<i>-Tight as you can.
-Okay.</i>

Somethings happening, she's
moving, I don't know what to do.

<i>-Sir, you need to focus.
-Okay, tell me what am I supposed to do.</i>

<i>Lucas, is she responsive?</i>

<i>-I don't know what that means.
-How is the breathing?</i>

It's upsetting. There's blood
bubbling out of her mouth.

<i>He's losing her.</i>

<i>I need to hear it.</i>

<i>-Can you hear?
-Yes.</i>

<i>Now listen carefully,
you have to intubate her,</i>

<i>do you know what that means?</i>

Stick a tube in her throat.

<i>Exactly, now you wanna
find a specific kit for that.</i>

<i>Pretty standard
stuff but it's specific.</i>

<i>-Lucas?
-What am I looking for?</i>

<i>Package or a cabra bag,</i>

<i>probably has a cubic meter
on the front.</i>

<i>In variant shape or size.</i>

What am I looking for?

<i>It's best to look
for the word intubation.</i>

<i>Or tracheal, endotracheal
or tracheal intubation.</i>

<i>Any of those.</i>

<i>Or airway, airway aesthetician,
airway management kit, EMS airway.</i>

<i>That's the one we use.</i>

<i>Anything that has those words on
it, just tell me what you find.</i>

<i>Lucas, tell me what you find.</i>

<i>You see anything that
looks like that?</i>

<i>-Got it.
-Okay good, first open the kit.</i>

<i>Look for a curved blade,
it's a metal hand tool.</i>

There's no blade
it's just the tube.

<i>-Just the tube?
-That's right.</i>

<i>You'll have to do manually.</i>

<i>First identify the glottis.</i>

<i>It's a little squishy valve at the back
of the throat. Feel for the breath.</i>

You want me to stick my
fingers in her throat?

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>You have to, it's the
intubation and have it ready.</i>

<i>You need to hurry, you
have to do it now.</i>

All right, locating it.

Okay.

<i>You must go farther Lucas, all
the way to the back of the tongue.</i>

<i>-Now do it.
-Okay.</i>

<i>Insert the tube.
Don't hesitate.</i>

<i>Keep going... keep going.</i>

Fuck! She's biting me.
She's biting me.

<i>What happened?</i>

<i>-What's happening?
-Something is wrong.</i>

<i>She's close to death.</i>

Who is this?

Hello? Who is this?

<i>I'm the surgeon, Lucas. I've been
listening since you've arrived.</i>

<i>-Okay!
-He's here to help.</i>

<i>Do you want to save her life?</i>

Yes!

<i>Then whatever you do, do not
remove your hand from her throat.</i>

<i>Trust me the tube
is not set</i>

<i>and is the only thing giving her oxygen,
the only thing keeping her alive.</i>

<i>But it's also killing her.</i>

<i>She's got several broken
ribs on her right side</i>

<i>and the diaphragm is unable
to compress the lung.</i>

<i>She can't breath, you
must compress the lung.</i>

<i>-How do you know that?
-You must compress the lung.</i>

<i>-I didn't tell you that.
-You must compress the lung.</i>

No, look I need a minute here
I'm not really sure how...

I must compress the lung. Fine.
What the fuck does that mean?

<i>First use your free hand
to expose the rib cage.</i>

Okay.

Okay, now what?

<i>-Slowly, carefully.
-You can do this Lucas.</i>

<i>-Now what?
-Make an incission.</i>

<i>-An incission?
-Make an incission.</i>

<i>You have to.</i>

Okay.

<i>You have the blade?</i>

<i>Five to seven inches.</i>

<i>Just below the rib cage.</i>

<i>Slowly.</i>

<i>Slowly.</i>

<i>Slowly.</i>

Okay.

<i>-Find the lung.
-Okay</i>

I got it.

<i>Compress the lung.</i>

Fuck!

Fuck!

Locked?

Fuck!

Fuck!

Claire!

<i>Claire's not here,
we're still on.</i>

<i>We're going to have to
talk about this, Lucas.</i>

I don't deserve this.

<i>Really?</i>

<i>Why don't you elaborate?</i>

She was out in the
middle of the road.

In the middle of
the fucking night.

In the middle of nowhere.

How am I supposed
to have expected...

I mean it's...

It's an extraordinary
circumstance, okay?

How am I supposed to be...

<i>-Lucas, it's okay.
-Absolutely okay.</i>

Right!

<i>You had no way of knowing.</i>

<i>She was in the middle
of the road.</i>

<i>In the middle of the fucking night.
In the middle of nowhere.</i>

<i>It doesn't have to
be your fault, Lucas.</i>

<i>Go be with your wife.</i>

I can just walk out of here.

<i>-Yeah.
-Yes.</i>

<i>-Yes.
-I can leave?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

And you aren't
tricking me again?

<i>No, Lucas.</i>

<i>Find the locker room.</i>

You'll see.

Do I need to worry about
what's back there?

<i>-No.
-Absolutely not.</i>

<i>You were never here.</i>

Okay.

I'm hanging up now.

<i>That's good, Lucas.</i>

Good night.

I'll take a beer and
a shot of whiskey.

You forgot to
shut the door.

No, I didn't.

It didn't latch.

Come on, Al!

I've been on my feet for
hours, just give me a beer.

First the door.

Seriously?

It's shut!

It's fine.

Sounds pretty sure
of herself, Al.

At the same time, being
sure is sort of a...

fancy way of being lazy.

You want to go
check the door?

I mean...

You can see from here it's
not shut all the way.

I'll buy you a beer.

Well...

when you put it like that.

All right, everybody.

Put your hands on the tables.

Cooperate and we'll get these
over with real fucking quick.

-You, sit the fuck down!
-Hang on, buddy.

Put your hands
on the table.

What the fuck part of "put your hands on
the table" so hard for you to understand?

Maybe before we all
get carried away here.

We stop and think for a minute?

-How's that sound?
-That sounds great.

I know that one shitty bar
might look like just any other.

But here's some free advice.

Get back on whatever road
it was that brought you here.

And keep moving.

'Cause I guarantee you,

that robbing this place,

is way more trouble
than it's worth.

This is not a robbery!

This is my sister.

Her name is Jessy.

I know that she's in this town.

Now, I don't want
to hurt anybody.

But I'm telling you
right the fuck now,

I'll do anything,

to find her. Put your
fucking hands on the bar!

Thank you!

Anyone?

Anybody see her?

Where'd you get that tattoo?

Did you get that around here?

I don't know if I can kill you.

But I bet that hurts
like a motherfucker!

One more step!
One more fucking step.

Last time,

have you seen her?

Yeah!

Yeah?

-Where?
-No where you can go, big shot.

You'll fucking take me.

Move, motherfucker!

Get in.

Get in.

And drive.

Fucking go, man.

<i>Where are my road warriors at?</i>

<i>You might be an old dog but you
still can learn some new tricks.</i>

<i>So, what's stopping you?
You don't owe the world, shit!</i>

<i>Each time live your own life and if
someone is dumb enough to stand in...</i>

You don't get a lot of time before
the whole valley finds out, but,

-you know that, don't you?
-Yeah.

If I need you to, I'm going to
have you drive off the road.

You don't want to do that.

Looks like the desert,
but if you go out there,

you might not come back.

What the fuck are
we doing here?

It's around back.

-In there.
-In where? What?

How do we get in?

Through the door.

Quit being so
fucking mysterious.

Sorry.

That's okay, Danny.

How did you know my name?

You're fucked, Danny.

And you don't even know it yet.

Don't you wanna see her?

Yeah.

Jessy?

Jessy, it's me Danny.

Danny?

Danny, you...

Are you really here?

I'm really here.

My God, you're hurt.

It's nothing.

It's nothing, I can't
believe I found you.

How did you even get here?

Man, Danny, you got old.

I've been searching for
you for thirteen years.

-You look absolutely incredible.
-Danny, wait.

Yeah, what?

How did you get here?

No. Danny, don't.

-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

I'm saving you, I came to
get you the hell out of here.

Danny, I don't want to leave.

You don't mean that, Jessy,
now get out of the fucking way.

-She does mean it, Danny.
-Shut up.

She's here because
she wants to be.

Come on, Danny.

It's time for you to leave.

Danny!

-Come on.
-Help.

Get your fucking hands
off of me.

Turn us around.

God damn it!

You're such an asshole.

I'm okay with that.

Just let me be an asshole and
get you the hell out of here.

Fuck!

Danny.

You're not supposed
to go out there.

If you do this, it's for you.

It's not for me.

I don't have a choice.

I can't see anything.

There's nothing to see.

Fucking car is gonna fall apart.

Don't slow down.

You're not supposed
to be here.

You can't stay here.

You can't take me with you.

I'm not leaving you behind.

You need your gun.

You have the gun, Danny?

You might have to blow
my brains out too

Stop it.

No, you can't stop.

You can't stop, Danny,
it's too late.

Before they stop!

Fuck.

Danny.

This place is made
for people like me.

You shouldn't be here.

I mean this whole
time growing up,

didn't you ever think
about mom and dad?

-What do you mean?
-Come on, Danny, tell the truth.

Hey, you really never
thought it was my fault.

You can't...

blame yourself for
what happened.

No. You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

-You were a kid, we were...
-I killed them, Danny.

I killed them because
I wanted to.

Right now I'm here because
I wanna be here.

This place found me
and I love it here.

Jessy help me! Jessy!

You should have let me go.

I just wanted to save you.

Jessy!

Jessy!

What are you looking at?

Well, I'm looking
forward to that.

-Hey!
-You can leave your stuff everywhere.

-Hey, sweetie!
. Hey, honey.

I'm so glad we got to do this
before you start school.

-Me too.
-Whoa.

Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

We still have this
one last weekend to have fun.

Play games and puzzles.

Make s'mores,
with our little girl.

It's just so exciting, sweety.

<i>Well, we all know the past
can be piece of shit sometimes.</i>

<i>But when it catches up to you,
you better be ready.</i>

<i>Keep your eyes on the road
and let that engine roar so loud</i>

<i>that you can't hear those
demons screaming in your ear.</i>

<i>Lock your doors,
make those tires burn.</i>

<i>Tell your family you love
them and kiss the past goodbye.</i>

<i>For once and for all.</i>

<i>Because every road
gotta end somewhere.</i>

<i>Am I right?</i>

All right.

Sure looks better
in the pictures.

Got some charm.

Listen why don't you go unpack and
we'll have dinner ready in an hour.

Cool.

I'm gonna open some wine.

Don't you think she's ready?

Of course not.

Is anyone ever?

At a certain point we just gonna
have to trust the future, right?

Let's hope that she
learn to believe in herself.

And that she'll
stand-up for herself.

She will.

Question is, are you ready?

I'll be fine.

Hold on, honey,
let your dad get it.

<i>This next one might be familiar
to some of you.</i>

Who is it?

<i>For all of you out there, who
don't want the night to end.</i>

<i>So, go ahead,
make some mistakes...</i>

Hello?

<i>You can always get it right
the next time.</i>

No one's there.

What is it?

Honey, call the cops.

-What?
-Call the cops now, go!

-Okay.
-Dad, what is it?

<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

Someone's trying to
break into the house.

<i>What's the address?</i>

It's 6255, Bethel lane.

<i>Just take a deep breath, we're gonna
be there in about thirty minutes.</i>

What?

<i>You are going to be fine.</i>

-Dad?
-Darryl?

Dad.

It's gonna take thirty minutes.

Dad, what's going on?

We gotta get out of here.
Come here.

What do you want?

What do you want?

Why are they doing this?

What about Jim?

What the fuck do you want
from us? Please what?

I'm sorry.

What are you talking about,
baby? What are you talking about?

I'll give you anything you want.

Let me know what I can do
to make this right, please.

My God!

You told...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

No, no. I could not.
No, no, Kate. No.

No! No!

No...

She was innocent.

She was innocent.

Jim, go!

Go! Go!

Bitch!

What do you want from us?

What do you want from us?

Go!

Go!

Thank you.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.

Hey! Get up!

Help.

We let you go!

Fuck you!

What have we done?

Fuck!

Shit, run!

Mich!

What the fuck!

What the fuck!

Un-fucking-believable.

Fuck!

-What about Shane?
-Fuck Shane. Shane was an asshole!

What the fuck is that thing?

Shit!

Fuck this shit!

Let's go home.

<i>Regret and remorse.</i>

<i>Amends and atonement,
that's life, right?</i>

<i>This next one is for you.</i>

<i>For all you lost souls racing
down that long road to redemption.</i>

<i>And all you sinners running
from your past,</i>

<i>but heading straight into that
bitter darkness up ahead.</i>

<i>We're all on that same endless highway,
the one with no name and no exits.</i>

<i>Looking for a way out of
tonight and into tomorrow.</i>

<i>Well, they're gonna
try to stop you,</i>

<i>but you got to say
'fuck it' and keep moving.</i>

<i>'Cause this is your highway.</i>

<i>And the day might
just be the day,</i>

<i>you finally out run
those wicked demons.</i>

<i>Once and for all.</i>

<i>And I'll be right here with you,
making sure you get where you're going.</i>

<i>Because in the end we're all
just trying to find our way home.</i>

<i>Right?</i>

Rough night?

Yeah
