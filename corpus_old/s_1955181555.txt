You're all set, Mr.
Lewis. Thanks, man.

So where ya off to this weekend? 
Oh, just headed down to Fort Walton.

Heard it's nice. You've never been? 
Bubbs, you could drive down there.

Yeah, well, have a good one alright?

Thanks again.



What was wrong with it? Nothin'.

Hey, we get anything good? Books, 
clothes. You want something,

Better grab it, 'cause I'm taking it in 
tomorrow. Hey, you mind if I take this?

Take it. Frank's back.

I really don't give a shit, but I know your
Mama does which means when you see him...

she's gonna find out about it, she's gonna 
call me and complain about it.

And that makes me give a shit. And giving 
a shit just pisses me off.

So don't do it.

Anything else, Grant?

Yeah, smart ass, your girlfriend called.

"Hey, it's Jess. Leave a message." Hey, 
just callin' ya back.

Down here with Ma'n them, ya need me.

Point being, I heard he was back in town

And I just thought maybe you'd wanna know.

Hey! What'd she want? Ah, who knows?

Maybe she's cheating on you. Stepping out!

Well you'd know all about
that, wouldn't ya, Gary? No! Hey,
Ma, how many

All his exes used the term "tradin' up" 
when describin' why they dump?

Well, actually, Bubbs...

"Trading up" got trumped by "unemployed"
every time.

How's it going? Great. I ain't
had one all day.

Proud of you. Don't know how
you do it, though, cold-turkey.

I couldn't do it. I have to
use the gum or something.

Ah, whatever works. What
y'all talkin' about?

Mary just quit smoking. And
to up the ante, Gary and I
are betting that she

Can last for the next couple
of months without sliding.

And seeing as how Gary
hasn't had a job or money

Since the three of us was in
high school...

Hey, what about when I
was... Selling meth don't count.

Anyway, wager is whoever loses has 
to clean the "john" back there.

Now I'm betting she can do it. But, Gary 
being the supportive optimist he is,

Is betting she can't, and Kenny, 
meanwhile my poor restroom's been

Back there festering for a
week. Is that what that was?

Yeah, and Gary's unholy addiction to 
chili dogs. She's right about that,

I do love the chili dogs.

What? They're good.

not the most reputable source.

But Gary does have his
finger on the pulse of that "community."

Ya mean the drunks? [Laughter]
Don't worry,

Ma, Grant told me the same thing
today. Listen, Bubbs,

I know that we've gone in
circles with this in the past.

But I was just hoping that

We could nip it in the bud now
and be done with it. Ma, c'mon...

Just promise me that you won't
see him this time, alright?
[The kitchen phone rings.]

It's probably Jess.
[The kitchen phone rings again]

Alright, alright...

Hello?

Jess, I'm finishin' up -
I'm finishin' up right now.
I called you back.

Jess...
Hello?

[Dog Barks] What?! How
long's this been going on?

Awhile. And we're moving to
Tampa. Jesus Christ, Jess, is
there anything else?

No, that's it. What the
hell's in Tampa?

Aaron got a job there and I'm
going with him. A job? Aaron
ain't worked a day in his life.

He's gonna end up at his Daddy's
goddamn dealership just like his
brothers!

Well at least he's trying
something different!

He ain't "tryin'" to do
nothin' but get in your pants!

You know what? Screw you,
Bubbs! We love each other
and we're making a move.

Which is a hell of a lot more
than I can say for you. Yeah,
what's that supposed to mean?

You haven't changed since
high school. You have the
same job,

The same friends and you
still live with your Mama.
It's fucking sad.

Yeah, what about Kenny? He still
lives with his Pops. Well, then
you two deserve each other.

Hey, that is not fair. You
know my situation, alright?

You're right, I
do.

But that's not what I want in
a boyfriend.

Do you know why I stayed
with you?

I thought I saw something.
Anytime you'd talk about
Frank

Or where someone was going
at work, you'd just light
up.

I thought that maybe one day
you'd warm to the idea
yourself

And we'd actually be some of
the people to leave this
place, but you never did.

You're going nowhere, Bubbs,
and if I stay,

That's exactly where
I'll end up too.



You got to do that out in the
open for all to see, don't you?
Well, I was hopin' you might

Catcha contact high, relax a
little. You know, Frank,

It's a wonder they ain't run
your ass up yet.

Well, you know, with a mug like
yours, it's a wonder Millie
ain't

Run your ass off
yet. Well, that won't be
happening anytime soon.

Oh, yeah? Whatcha got her
chained to the deck
again?

No, retard, we're getting
married. Oh, really?

Yeah, he asked me a couple
months ago. Ya know he likes
guys, right?

Fuck off, Frank!
Robert, he's
joking.

No, it's always the same shit
with this guy. And I'm
getting tired of it.

Stay away from my
fiancÃ©.

She ain't your
type. "Not my
type?"

You're a juvenile, Frank, and
a delinquent at that.

And by some miraculous act
of God you're not locked-up
or dead,

But that's where your luck
runs out. 'Cause you know
what?

You're just a
functioning alcoholic,

With no friends to speak of,
and with the exception of
your Grandson,

The little family you do
have, don't want nothing to
do with you.

Yeah, but I gotta hard-on that
won't quit. All natural, too.

I'm warning you, Frank.
Listen, Rob, even if I gave
a shit it wouldn't matter.

Oh, yeah? And why's
that?

Ladies just love
outlaws.

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! The hell's
goin' on here?

Oh, hey, Bubbs. Robby here's
just showin' me some new
dance steps.

Pretty girly
actually.

Tell your Grandfather to
watch himself.

Hey,
Rob!

Oh - God! Tell him to get
some friggin' underpants.
That's disgusting!

It's called
air-conditionin', pal!

Goddammit.

Stick's so far up his ass
it's ticklin' his goddamn
tonsils.

How's your
Mama? She's
fine.

She's quittin' smokin'.
Good for her, it's a
filthy habit.

Oh, got somethin' for
ya.

How was it?
Fuckin' fantastic.

Fished this reef called
Cayo Paraiso, it's like
paradise.

Catchin' blue-fin tuna,
marlin, lobster. Ate like a
goddamn king.

And the women -
beautiful.

Now they'd loathe to call
themselves "workin' girls,"

What with bein' Catholic
and all, but you flash a little

American coin and they'll do
anything you want.

Hey, you ever gonna
write somethin' on
these?

Like what?
Never mind.

So how's your
lady? We broke up.

It's about goddamn time,

These hot bottom southern belles
running around

I'm surprised you ain't done
it sooner

Actually, she left me for
some asshole.

Southern Belles on Spring break
or somethin'? When're ya leavin'
again?

I'm serious.

Shit, son, I just got back.
Other than that jackass,
across the way,

And now possibly you, I ain't
had time to wear out my
welcome yet.

'Sides, I was kinda
thinkin' about stickin'
around for awhile.

And doin' what?
Anything that
moves.

Nah, just doin' a little
drinkin', fishin' with
you,

And maybe learnin' to play
this here guitar.

I always wanted to be one
of those laid-back

Country pickers like old
Waylon Jennings.

[Guitar strum]

Why? Just
wonderin'.

You know what we need to
do, right?

Run the streets and
disturb some damn
peace!

Kenny, man, I can't.
Man, can't never
could.

Look, the only way you gonna get
over this broad

Is by gettin' over on another
one.

That's the beautiful thing about
being single.

Holla at a hoochie with a
proper ass, take her
home,

Knock the muthafuckin' dust
off it,

Wake up in the mornin' and
do it all over again.

Plus, Corey's meetin' us out and
I'd hate to leave her hangin'.
She is? Hayes comin'?

No, told her to leave that
knucklehead at home. Well, shit,
Kenny,

Shit Kenny, why didn't ya say
so? Lemme get my keys.

Hey, you know sistas are
off limits, right? Right?

Especially when they my
own!



Can I ask ya somethin'? Ya
ever thought about - leavin'?

And goin' where?
I dunno. Anywhere.

Nah, not really - why? I
dunno, sometimes I think

There's gotta be more to
it than just this.

It ain't
us. Huh?

It ain't us, man. Look, we
the "have nots." I'm not
trying to say I feel

Sorry for us, I'm just
sayin' we don't have the

Opportunity that most folks
have.

The only way we leave this
muthafucka is by joinin'
the Army or playin' ball.

Now the military ain't for
us

And basketball, shit, we
ain't get past high school.

What we do is, we stay on
our grind, play the hand we
was dealt

And try and get our dicks
wet along the way. It's like
our folks, man,

They was born and raised
here, they gonna die here.

What the fuck are you two
doing? What?

You were busy, we were
thirsty, so we helped
ourselves.

Man, get the fuck outta
here. So what you got over
there?

It's good. They all just
turned twenty-one.

At least that's what their
IDs say. Meaning they ain't
never been here before,

Meaning they don't have a
clue who we are. Dude, I've
been feeding them

Every girly-ass frou-frou
fruit drink I could think of,
ever since we opened.

Fuckin' tee-ball.
Nah-nah-nah, hey, just give
me a couple minutes, okay?

I think I'm making some headway
with one of 'em. Ya gotta
couple.

Hey, man, I'm sorry to
hear about you and Jess.

You know, I always kinda
thought she was cute, so -
I dunno,

If things don't work out between
her and Aaron, think maybe I
could-

Beers and shots, asshole.
Three of 'em.

And, no, the third one is not
for you, you insensitive
prick.

I'd be careful, Kenny...

Joe's been known to spit
in people's drinks for less
than that.

Fuck a damn
bitch!

Fuck a damn
bitch!

Hey, why don't y'all go find
a table? I'll meet up with
you.

I thought you were going
to give me a couple
minutes?

After that Jess shit? Fuck
no, pal. You're lucky I
don't throw ya a beatin'.

What a ho. Yeah, but ya
know what? It's got me
thinkin'.

About what, getting a blood
test? No, well, yeah now. But
more than that,

You know, about what's next.
I mean, she's right. I can't
do what I've been doin' forever.

What are you thinking? I
dunno. Just sorta weighin' my
options right now,

I guess. But enough about
that, how're you doing? How's
work?

Work's work - same old
drunks, just a different day.

You know, Kenny and I've been
meanin' to come down there...

Yeah, yeah. I'll believe it when
I see it.

Only been tending bar down there
for two years. Corey, mark my
words.

I'm comin' down. It's
alright.

Ain't really the
place for you to meet nice
girls anyway.

You know your brother, ya
think he gives a shit about
that?

I was talking about you,
Bubbs.

Yeah, well, you work
down there, don't ya?

So, uh, how's Hayes?
Y'all still doin' okay?

Yeah, I guess. Some days
are good. Some days, less
than.

Sounds like a
blast.

So where is he tonight?
Staying in. When Kenny
called,

"We gotta do somethin',
shit." That's good, I like
that.

So, not having a locked
locale was reason enough for
Hayes to bail.

You sure about
that?

Excuse
me.

"Didn't think I was going to
be here?"

That's your excuse? You believe
that? I-I don't...

Corey, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...
Yeah, "whoa," you crazy
goddamn bitch!

Hey! Man, this shit don't even
concern you, Bubbs. Yeah? Well
it does now.

Enough! Corey, calm
down!

Hayes, get the fuck outta
here!

These are mine now,
bitch. Let's go.

I want to go
home. C'mon.

What about Kenny? So ya like
chicken and beer and gettin'
your ass spanked?

I think I'm in
love.

You know, I'm kinda
surprised by ya, actually.

You know, comin' up, ya never
put up with no one's shit, so I
dunno. Neither do I.

Least ya threw your keys at
him.

Shut up. That's all I
could find.

Thanks for sticking up for
me, though.

So ya gonna be alright
tonight?

Ya know, with... He won't
come home tonight.

Okay. Well I
better... What?

Go, I guess? Ya just
said... That he won't be

Home
tonight.

So, what do you want to
do?

Right now? There's a pretty
big difference between

What I wanna do and maybe
what I should do.



So why'd you ask me when I was
leavin' the other day? Ah, I was
just bustin' your balls.

C'mon now,
Bubbs...

Jess dumped me 'cause she
said I wasn't goin' nowhere.

Thing is, I've always been
curious

About leavin'. I just never
really considered it an option.
Thinkin' about it now?

A little, yeah. Son, if you're
hesitant because of your Mama
I'm gonna shit.

You're too old...
Hey-hey-hey, you dunno
my situation.

'Sides, ain't that. There's a
girl. A girl? Find one of those
anywhere.

Not like this one. Look,
Bubbs, chasin' tail is fun.

Hell, it's one a my
favorite pastimes.

But we're talkin' about
your life here.

You know, ya only get one
shot at this,

Well, less ya believe in
reincarnation and then ya

Can take your sweet-ass
time.

But if ya got dreams, ya go
after 'em. Don't let some
skirt hold ya back.

That's the thing. She
ain't just "some skirt,"
Frank.

She's what I've compared
girls to my whole life. It's
complicated.

This "complication" gotta
name? Yeah, Corey

And she's gotta
boyfriend. Speed bump,
what else?

Ya know my friend Kenny?
It's his sister.

Interesting,
and?

And, uh, I sorta slept with
her. [Laughs]

You "sorta slept with
her?" Shit, son,

You remind me more of
myself every-goddamn-day.

So what do I do? Well it
ain't brain surgery. You
gotta let her know.

Ask her out. Clear up any
confusion ya got quicker
than antibiotics

On a burnin' case of the
clap.

And what do I say to her?
Well, now that's kinda tough
to say.

A woman can be in any
assortment a moods,

But - tell ya somethin'
that's worked for me

From time to time. I just
say, "I can't wait to see
you."

"I can't wait to see you?"
How many a those you had
today?

That's even tougher to
say.


We need to talk about
this.

Hayes - hello? Damn
it. Told you, Corey

Boy ain't no
good. Don't
start.

Hey, what are you doing here?
Told ya I'd come down, didn't
I?

I guess you did. Well can I
get you something?

Yeah-yeah, a beer'd be
great.

Bubbs, this is Mr.
Brownlee. Mr.
Brownlee, Bubbs.

How ya doin', sir? The
hell kind of name is
"Bubbs?"

Hey, is there someplace we can
talk? Yeah, sure.

Look, I dunno what the
situation's like between
you and Hayes,

But the other
night

I thought there might of
been somethin' there.

And I just wanted to see if
ya maybe wanted to go out

With me or somethin'
sometime.

Bubbs - I had a good time
with you too.

But Hayes and I've been
together for a long time

And it's just, that I
don't... It's cool.

I just had to ask. I'll,
uh, see ya around, alright?

Wait, you don't have
to... I got - somewhere
to be.

Hey, you going to finish
that?

Huh? No, it's all
you.

Him I
like.



Have you been going down there?
What? Where did you get these?
Did he give them to you?

Why ya goin' through my stuff?
Answer me! No, they're not
from him, alright? Jesus!

But what if they
were?

Why would that be so bad? I
don't want him hurting you
the way he

Hurt me and you know that.
That was a long time ago,
Ma. Maybe he's changed.

People like that don't
change. Frank is a selfish
old man

Who doesn't give a damn about
anybody but himself. Well, did
ya ever think that maybe...

Bubbs, he started
something that he couldn't
finish

A family. He left us,
your Grandmother and I to

Fend for ourselves. And for
what? So he could run
around

And have a good time? His
life is not one worth living.

Yeah, how do you
know? I'm sorry?

Look, Ma, I've been doin' some
thinkin' lately and...
[Phone ringing] And what?

[Phone rings again] Ya
gonna get that, or am I?

Just let the machine pick it
up. It's probably Corey
anyway.

What? She's been calling
here all afternoon. Now
what were you going to say?

What were you going to
say?!

Corey? How'd you know it
was me?

My Mama told me. What's goin'
on? I broke up with Hayes.

You did? Yeah. Why don't you
come over and I'll tell you
all about it.

Okay. Oh, hey,
Corey? Yeah, Bubbs?

I can't wait to see
you.



Hey, so if you liked me, why'd
ya turn me down?

Oh, I don't
know. Maybe it's the fact that
you're my brother's best friend.

Or that until a couple days
ago, my unblemished record
of never

Cheating on a boyfriend was
blown out of the water. Well,
when ya put it like that...

You know we got to tell
Kenny, right?

Yeah, but lemme do it,
alright?

Wonder how he's going to take
it? How did Hayes?

Not so well. A lot of
yelling, screaming.

Been together a long time,
you know?

Do you know why I like
you?

You're not like him.
You're calm, rational...

Well
hung...

Bubbs, I'm serious. You
think things out and I
appreciate that.

With him it was - not like
that.

He never

Did anything, did
he?

No.

Whatever, bitch - next
week!

Hey, so how'd it go the other
night with ol' girl? Anna -
great.

I'll spare ya the details,
but fried chicken and a
paddle was involved.


You're rememberin' their
names now. I'm impressed. Ya
gonna call her?

Hey, I remembered her name,
but let's not talkin' crazy,
alright?

Kenny, what happens when you run
outta girls around here?

Man, we'll burn that bridge
when we come across it,
brotha.

What about you? You boned
out

Pretty quick last night,
thought you found
somethin' yourself.

Bubbs, did you do
somethin' last night?

Ya know you can tell me if ya
went hoggin'. Everybody gotta
ham-bone or two in they closet.

I didn't go
hoggin'. So what's
up, man?

That night at the
bar

I ended up givin' your sister
a ride home.

So? So when we got there,
things happened,

We were both in a weird
place and, well - we sorta
got together.

What the fuck does that
mean?

That we did - like
that.

I'll understand ya wanna take
a shot at me.



Maybe they're spank
books. Uh-oh.

What do you think? Who
knows? Could have some of
those

National Geographic pictures
in there.

You know, with the ones
hanging down to their
knees.

be anything.

It could be a hobby, a
collection or just something
he interested in.

Kenny interested in anything
like this? If it ain't got tits
or basketball,

Kenny ain't gonna read
it.

Hey - don't confuse your
perversions for my son's,
alright?

Oh, I'm not, sir. You
see, I am an ass man

Who loves
NASCAR.

I'm just worried because
I think they're from
Frank.

Well what does Bubbs
say? That they're not.

But I don't know that I believe
him.

Well maybe I'm stating the
obvious, but have you
tried talking

To Frank about this? She ain't
talked to him in over twenty
years, numnuts.

Why would she start now?
It's true. Well
everything except

For the "numnuts" thing.
Well call Grant. He's
down there,

He knows what's going on.
Might be able to clear things
up.

You all know what I do in
stressful times like these.

And I will be outside if you
want to join me.

Right out there.
Mary-Mary-Mary, now you've
come too far

To be taking to the ass-
backwards advice of that
clown.

Here, chew on these you get
the itch. They helped me.

You mean, like for
tourists?

Yeah, those came
out of the Salvation Army
box.

What? Yeah, the donation box
here in my office. People put
all kinds of stuff in there.

Sometimes Bubbs digs through
it, he takes what he wants.

You know, been pulling books
out of there for awhile.

Really? And you're sure
that there's no way

That Frank could've...
Mary-Mary, I know every
single person

Who's put anything into that
box and I guarantee you
Frank is not one of 'em.

Well, okay. Thanks,
Grant. Sorry to bother
you.

Alright, alright,
goodbye.

What was it that I
explicitly asked

You not to get me involved
in? What?

"What?" That was your Mom on the
phone. Grant, look, man,
that's...

Don't "Grant look" me. Whatever
it is you're doing... Man, I'm
not even doing anything!

I don't care. Stop doing
it.

Fine. We done here? No,
we're not "done here."

Payday.
Thanks.

Buy yourself some decent
britches. I'm sick of

Looking at the crack of your
ass everyday.

You don't see the crack of
my ass everyday, do ya?


So, how's the little lady?
Good. Shame I can't say
the same for her brother.

Ah, give him time. He'll come
around. Yeah, I hope so.

Hey, can I ask you
somethin'? What do you think
about her bein' -

Black? Not a
damn thing.

Ah, some folks may get their
panties in a pinch about
that shit, but not me.

I've courted many a woman. They
came in every shape, shade,
size

Not to mention position.
Ya know what really
matters?

And this's all that does, is
what you think about her. Well I
think she's great.

Well fuck everybody else. Ya
love her? Shit, Frank, I dunno.

Oh, yeah, ya do. Ya like
bein' with her? You miss her
when she's gone?

You dream about her at
night? Sure, I guess.

Well let her know for Christ's
sakes. Yeah, but, Frank, man,
the girls these days...

Besides, what's the worst that
could happen? She don't say it
back.

Yeah, but at least you'll know.
Me, I tell everybody I love 'em.

That's 'cause you're normally
all fucked up.

TouchÃ©. You ever tell my Mama
you loved her?

A long time
ago.

It was my birthday and her and
her Mom saved up to get me
this gift.

What was it? Ah, don't
matter. I left the next
day.

Wasn't cut out to be no
father. Told your Grandmama
that,

She thought I'd change. And
sure I'd try, leave, come
back, try again.

But the sea was my first love
and just kept callin' me
back.

You ever think about tryin'
to make things right?

Everyday. Then
why don't ya?

Nah, it's just too
late.

Could always try. I mean,
what's the worst that
could happen, right?

Outta every guy in this fuckin'
town, you gotta go and pick him?
Yeah, why not?

First of all he's, well, you
know... What, white?

Well, yeah.
He is
white.

muthafucka. Keep it up and
you might be missin' a few.

That ain't even what this is
about though, is it? What
happened to Hayes, huh?

You just up and dump a brotha
because Bubbs all of a sudden
gets single?

You and Daddy never
even liked Hayes!

Neither did
I. I'm done.

What does it matter who
I'm with anyway?

We grew up with the kid. It's
just-it's just fuckin' awkward.
"Awkward?"

No, there's got to be more to
it. He's my best friend, Corey.

For the past couple years,
he's been tied up with that
bitch.

You know how it is when you
with someone - your friends
are your friends,

But they ain't at the same
time. Now I finally got my
boy back,

My road dog, my partner in
crime and my own sister
yanks him off the streets again.

It's like I never had a
chance. I'm not going to keep
him away from you

If that's what you're worried
about. It's not the same.

This isn't just some fling.
We like each other and I
think we always have.

What? It ain't like
either of us knew. And if
we had,

We wouldn't have done
anything out of respect for
you.

But times change, things
happen

And for some reason this
makes sense - at least to us.

In fact, it should to you
too. The fuck it should.

Kenny, I'm on your side, I
know how y'all are and I ain't
trying to change that.

What other girl would even
know where to start with you
two?

She's right, you
know? Sorry, now I'm
done.

Thanks.

So I heard you been talkin' to
Grant. I was worried, okay?

I'm sorry. I mean, between
you and Jess breaking up and
Frank

Coming back, it's been a
difficult time. Everything's
fine, Ma. Really.

I've been seein' someone.
Been a couple of weeks now.

What?
Who?
Corey

Jim's
girl.

What? You sure know how
to keep

Things interesting, I'll give
you that. This's real, Ma.

I'm
sorry.

Are you happy? 'Cause, you
know, that's all that matters.

I am,
actually.

Well then so am
I.

Oh, I think this belongs to
you.


What the hell do
you... Oh.

When you and Jess split, I
thought we'd finally move

Out and get that place we
talked about.

You know, pimp it out, throw
some barbecue, pull box like
we rented us a U-haul.

Just got bummed I didn't get
to bring it up

Before you moved onto my
sister - no pun intended.

I had no idea,
man How could
you?

So hit me with it. How long's it
been like this? Long time.

And you never felt like sayin'
shit? The hell was I supposed to
say?

"Kenny, ya know your sister
I've grown up with my whole
life?

Yeah, well, I think she's
hot."

Was that so bad?
Yeah, man, it
was.

Pussy. Bubbs, if you liked
her, you should have told me.

I might not have been tryin' to
hear it, but I would've
listened. And then what?

I'd a gotten over it. Lord
knows I like ya a helluva

Lot better than that morose
muthafucka Hayes.

It's more than that,
Ken.

I think I love
her.

Ya know what? I can dig
it. Yeah?

Yep. Now tell me about this
thing at the bar a couple
weeks back,

When you was axin' about
leavin' and shit. What the
hell was that?

Nothin'. Didn't sound
like nothin'.

It was nothin', man. Good.
'Cause if you with Corey,

Then you with her. Ain't
no half-assin' this.

Ya do her wrong, ya fuck her
over, you're doin' the same
to us.

And speakin' of us, we still
gotta kick it.

I don't want
ya pullin' that disappearin'
act

Like you did with Jess,
alright? Alright.

So we
cool?
Yeah...

Long as ya pass that shit
back.


Frank, how's it going,
buddy?

Hey, what're
those?

Ah, somethin' from
Millie.

Somethin' goin' on with you and
Miss Jenkins? That Millie's last
name?

Shit, no wonder Rob don't
like me callin' her "hot
pants."

You know they're engaged,
right?

Yeah -
yeah...

Bubbs, you know I've never been
missed? What?

To my recollection,
nobody's ever missed me.

Feelin' sorry for
yourself? No-no,

I just - forget
it.

Hey, you sure ya
wanna... [Bang... crash]

Jesus Christ. Maybe that's the
answer, Bubbs. Think he misses
me?

I doubt it. Oh
well. His loss.

Bubbs, you ever wonder how
similar folks can be so
different all at the same time?

Frank, I think ya need to go to
bed. No-no-no, I'm tryin' to
talk to ya here, son.

Well now take you and me
for example.

We alike in a lot a
ways, except for our
luck.

You, you've always been
luckier in love.

Ya got friends and family
that care about you, lady on
your arm to boot.

Me? I've been with more
women than I care to
remember,

But can't forget all the time
I spent alone.

Have been lucky in life,
though. While you were
stuck here,

I've danced and drank,
ate, O.D.'d,

Cheated death and taxes, I've
run from the law, gone
straight and run again.

Seen shit so scary you can
crap your shorts and sights so
beautiful,

It'd make you wanna
cry.

Kicker is, we're both
intrigued by the other.

Which makes me think that
the answer's

A little bit a
both.

You know, Bubbs, you can
see everything in the
world,

But if you ain't got nobody
to share it with

It just ain't worth a
helluva lot,

Ya know? It
just...

It just ain't worth
a...

Just ain't worth a
helluva lot...

Just
ain't...


Been down here awhile, huh?
Yeah, you know,

Grant gave me my first
job when I was fourteen,

Been workin' for him ever
since.

Ever think about what's
next? Ya mean like job-wise?

Yeah, that, or living with your
Mama-wise. That's what this's
about, isn't it?

I bet she still does your
laundry, huh?

Yeah, but only 'cause she does
such a kick-ass job. I mean,
smell this.

Please, I'd rather
not.

So is it financial or
something? No, I got a little
tucked away.

Then what? It's Ma. She -
she needs me.

She's been left by
everyone she's ever cared
about.

Frank left when she was little,
her older sister passed in
grade school,

Followed by her
Mama a little later

And to top it all off, my
piece a shit father ran off to
Pensacola

To be with some waitress. I
just can't do it to her is
all.

I'm only talking about
moving out of the house,
Bubbs.

Yeah, but what if I'm
not?

What?

Ever since I was little I'd
come down here and watch
the boats

Take off, just wishin' I was
on one of 'em.

Didn't matter where it was
goin', just as long as it
was leavin'.

You still think like
that? Yeah - don't you?

No.
Really?

You've never thought about
gettin' out, seein'
someplace new?

You're fine workin' in that bar
every night, gettin' shit tips
if y? It's not perfect, but it's
work.

And that's a lot more than
some can say.

Besides, what would I
do someplace else?

Anything ya want,
Corey.



Christ!


Lock the door behind you.
Jesus. The hell happened
in here?

Hey, you
okay?

Corey, what - what
happened?

He was here when I got
home. Who was?

Hayes. Hayes was here?
Tonight? Lemme see that.

Tell me what
happened. Bubbs, I...

Tell me!

He used the spare key to
get in. He'd been drinking
and wanted to talk

And try and patch things up. I
told him I was with you now
and he flipped.

And what, he hit
you?

Oh, that motherfucker...
Bubbs, no! That's not what
I want.

I don't really give a shit right
now, alright?! Well you should
if you want to stay with me.

There's a reason I'm with you
and not him. Corey, I am not
about to let this slide.

Bubbs, I want to be with you,
but you do this and we're
done.

Should help you learn the
guitar. Think I saw some
ol' Waylon in there too.

What's all these scribbles and
shit? Ah, got it used.

Thanks, Bubbs. I appreciate
it.

Frank, what if somethin'
happened to somebody ya cared
about

And it wasn't somethin' that
should be gotten away with,

But the person it happened to
didn't want ya to do nothin'
about it.

Wouldn't ya do it anyway? If
this's about me, I'm lost.

Corey's old boyfriend got drunk
and-roughed her up. Jesus.

Yeah. Thing is, she don't
want me doin' nothin' about
it,

Includin' tellin' her
brother. Why the hell not?

I dunno. Says she's with
me 'cause I'm not like him

And that it's over and I
should just let it be.

Maybe ya should? How can I?

This fuckin' guy can't deal,
gets bombed, beats her up and
it's okay?

And what kinda boyfriend does
that make me? One that listens?

Please... Bubbs, it comes
down to three things -

What your head says, what
your heart says and what your
gut says.

Well my head says to go along
'cause I don't wanna lose
her.

My heart doesn't say
shit, it just hurts.

And my gut - says to beat his
goddamn ass. Well if ya want
things to stay the same,

You better listen to your
head. And what do you say?

You know, I've been in fights
all my life.

Whether I woke
up with a busted fist or a
busted face,

I can't remember anything
ever turnin' out for the
better.

But, on the other hand, in
my experience, folks usually
get what's comin' to 'em.

I say go and talk to this
guy,

Tell him the only reason
you're not sendin' his teeth

Down his throat is 'cause she
asked ya not to,

But there ain't gonna be
a "next time." If he
can't understand that?

Then you listen to your
gut.

I need to talk to
you.

Go
Inside.

Look, I know,
alright?

And the only reason I ain't
fuckin' you up right now is

'Cause she begged me not
to.

But I hear you've been
anywhere near her? It's on.

Reason you ain't doing
shit, ain't 'cause of
Corey,

It's 'cause you a
bitch. Just stay away
from her, asshole.

Ain't like it's the first
time.

But I'm sure she told you
all about that, right?

And that's the truth. And
that's why I don't cook
bacon naked no more.

And yet another reason why
never to eat breakfast
with Gary.

I can show you the scar, if you
want, right here. Noooo!!

What the hell happened to
you? Oh - work.

Hey, what can we get you,
sweetheart? Nothing. I need to
talk to Bubbs

Right now -
outside.

Oh, you're in trouble
now... Ow.

Don't. Dawn called and told
me everything.

He's an asshole, alright? He's
had it comin'. If it wasn't me,
it'd.

Then why not let them do
it?

Because I care about you,
that's why. What he did-I
had to.

You didn't... Yes,
Corey, I did!

Even after promising me you
wouldn't?

Hey, I had every intention a
just talkin' to him. That was

Until I found out the truth.

I was trying to protect
you. From what?!

Bubbs, stuff like that can mess
with your head. I could a
handled it.

I also didn't want you thinking
differently about me. Like I was
broken or something.

The only thing makin' me think
differently's the fact ya
lied.

Guess that makes us even
then.

Corey, he needed to know that
shit was wrong and now he
does.

If not for you, for every
other girl that dickhead
dates.

I'm glad I did it and
I'd fuckin' do it again.

Do you know why I liked
you?

It's because I thought you
were different. Different than
most guys around here

And definitely different than
Hayes. But I guess I was
wrong.



You know, just look at it
like this-now you're free to
meet someone new.

Yeah, I guess you're
right.

Oh, no-no-no, it's on
me.

You know, Jess, ever since
high school I always kinda...

Beer, Joe...
and a shot.

So...
One sec.

Rough day?

What do you care?

Corey and I had a fight. I
think we might be breakin'
up, actually.

Must be something going
around.

So did Aaron and I.
Really? What
happened?

Well you were
right.

He ain't moving to
Tampa.

He said he just liked the way I
shook my... Yeah, yeah, I got it.

But mostly, he said that
folks like he and I don't
stay together.

Folks like
who?

Folks like him, with money, and
folks like... Us?

That rich fuckin' bitch. Ya
know, just 'cause we ain't
got what he's got,

He thinks he can judge us?
Fuck him. You're better off.

You said,
"Us." Huh?

You said, "Us." Is that
still how you think of you
and me?

I dunno, Jess, it just came
out.

I know I don't want
anyone doin' ya wrong,
though.

Even after?

Even after.

Fuck that! You should a told
me. I thought I could handle
it.

You thought? Corey, I'm your
brother. How can I help you
if I don't know?

I'm sorry, Kenny. Know what?
You can't be mad at Bubbs no
more.

Like hell I can't. That's what
relationships are all about.

If someone asks you not to do
something,

You don't say you won't,
then turn around and do it
anyway.

Hey, all I know, he done what
any guy, in his shoes, would
a done.

That's the problem. I don't
want a guy like that.

I want a guy that can use his
head for a change.

Yeah, well, good luck
findin' that.

You know what I
mean. Well I disagree.

You do, huh? Well lemme axe
you somethin', why didn't you
tell me?

I don't know. Sure you do.
'Cause I'd a done the same
fuckin' thing and you know this.

So if you're mad at him, you
have to be mad at me too. Why?

Why is that always the answer
with you guys? I don't know,
Corey, it just is.

A muthafucka does somethin'
like that, gotta heap a
shitty karma comin' their way

And I'm glad somebody
fuckin' gave it to him. Just
mad I ain't get my licks in.

Unbelievable.

Look, I appreciate what you
sayin',

But you have to
understand where he's
comin' from.

He found out someone hurt
his girl, the one he grew up
his whole life with,

The one he's been crushin'
on forever,

But had to keep it a secret,
the one that knows every
embarrassin' thing about him,

But still wants to kick
it.

The one he loves.

What?

It's true. He told me.
Where do you think he
is?

What're ya doin'? I wanted to
talk to you without Joe all
hovering around.

So ya come into the
guy's shitter?

I've missed you,
Bubbs.

Jess... Look, this ain't the
drinks talking, so just hear
me out, alright?

I've said some terrible
things and I'm sorry.

It's not where you are,
it's where you're going.

And when you get to where
you're going,

You'll have done it all by
yourself, which is a hell of
a lot more

Than Aaron can say. This
whole experience

Has put things into
perspective for me and - I
want you back.

Look, Jess, I appreciate
ya sayin' all this, I do,

But I'm with Corey now. Ya
know that.

Are you, Bubbs? I mean,
don't you think it's kinda
funny

Us both ending up here
tonight? These kinda things
happen for a reason, you know.

It's a small town. Let's not
read too much into it,
alright?

You can't tell me that it
wouldn't be nice to be with

Somebody that understands
right now.

No, I mean, yeah.

It would, I guess.

Well who understands
better than us?

I mean, we know what we
like and we know what we
don't.

I say we start with right
now and take it from there.

Where is he? Actually,
he's right there.

Corey-Corey,
wait!

Wait-wait-wait...

Will ya just stop? That wasn't
what it... What? It looked like?

You know what? It's fine.
Whatever happened in there,
can stay in there,

'Cause we weren't going to work
out anyway. Corey, wait.
Look-look...

This whole thing was doomed
from the beginning.

So let's just chalk it up
to what it is, a mistake,

And stop wasting each other's
time. You are not a waste of my
time.

We're two completely
different people, Bubbs.
Let's face it, we're not a
good fit.

How can you say that? After
after everything?

We want different things
and that's never going to
change.

Like what?! What're you
even talkin' about?

Leaving, Bubbs. That's what
I'm talking about.

Corey, that was just talk.
I got no plans to do
nothin'.

Yeah, for right now. But what
about next month? Or six
months from now? Or next year?

That's not something I'm
thinking about 'cause I'm in
no position to do it.

Corey -
Corey...

I love you.

I know.

These kind of things happen
for a reason.

Jess - fuck off.

Postcards? Nope, don't know
nothing about no postcards.
You're sure?

Maybe if I come down there and
show you... Mary-Mary, they did
not come from here, honey. Okay?

Okay -
thanks.

Kenny, look,
man...

What the fuck I tell ya?!
Man, it ain't what it
fucking looks like!

You wanna get beat?! Keep
lyin'! I thought I laid it out
pretty clear, did I not?!

Kenny, I... Shut up! I told
you - you fuck over her,

You fuckin' over us. Well, you
done fucked up. You done broke
every rule in the goddamn book.

Made me choose sides! My
advice to you?

You thought about leavin'
once, do it again. 'Cause me
and Corey?

We done with ya. Now get the
fuck off my lawn.

Already told ya, boy. Think
my ramblin' days are done.

Why now all of a
sudden?

I'm seventy years old. I'd
hardly call that "all of a
sudden." What's goin' on anyway?

Next time you were thinkin'
about takin' off, I wanted
to go with ya.

What about your
lady? It's a long
story.

Listened to your gut,
huh? Yeah, and then some.

Well, I never vouched for
listenin' to your bowels.

They don't do nothin'
but talk shit.

What's the matter with this
place, Bubbs?

They don't call it the
"Sunshine State" for
nothin'.

I'm just tired of wakin' up
to the same ol' shit, ya know?
Of never seein' nothin' new,

Of hopin' one day it'll all be
different. Nah, told ya, Bubbs,

I'm through with all that.
Much's I hate to admit it,
I'm gettin' on up there.

Frank, you said you could
see everything in the world,

But it didn't mean nothin'
if you couldn't share it
with somebody.

I said that? Must a been
bombed outta my gourd.

Point bein', share it with me. I
mean, I know that sounds weird,
but let's do it.

Grandfather,
Grandson, one big trip.

Yeah, I dunno... Look, it's
hard growin' up with a single
Mom, alright?

I mean, they try, but they can't
teach ya everything. And that's
wh. Me?

Yeah, ya taught me how to
cuss and grill a steak, how
to sail this boat

And throw a punch, how to
change my own oil

And a thousand other
things every guy should
know.

I wasn't around that
much.

Yeah, but it was still a
hundred percent more than
my father.

Look, I just want ya to know
that I appreciate it

And I was hopin' we could
do some more of that.

What's your Mama say about
that? Nothin'. Ain't told her
yet.

Well I'm sorry, son, but this
conversation's over 'til ya do.

But, Frank, man, you don't
understand...

Listen, Bubbs, we both know
that she don't even like ya
down here.

Much less talkin'
about this kinda shit.

Now I'm not sayin' I won't
think about it, but not 'til
ya talk to her.

And that's somethin' I
just can't do.

Ma, I need to talk to you
about something.

What are these? They're from
him, aren't they?

Yeah, but it's not what you
think. There are no "but's." We
are talking about this.

I'm leavin', Ma. With him.
What? What about Corey and
work?

We broke up and - it's
time.

But you promised... I
never promised, alright?

I'm stuck here. I need to know
what's out there. I've been...
No.

Whatcha mean, "No?" I am your
mother and I'm saying "No."
You can't go.

Well I'm tellin' you I
am.

You don't know him like I know
him. You're right, I know him
better.

He will leave everything,
including you, if the
situation gets a little too...

He wouldn't do that to me.
Trust me, he would.

His is not the sort
of life worth living.

Yeah, well, at least he lives
his. Excuse me?

Mama, you've been burned,
alright? I get that.

But ya stopped livin'
your life because of
it.

You're afraid of lettin'
anyone in or out 'cause of
what might happen.

And you can't forgive Frank for
somethin' that happened over
twenty! He left, Bubbs! It's...

Unforgivable, I know.
Especially if ya never give
the man a chance.

How dare
you?

'Cause you need to hear
it, alright? Ya know why I
stuck around this long?

It's 'cause I felt sorry for
ya.

I was worried what you
might do if I left, but now
I don't care.

I'm leavin' and I just
wanted you to know.

Woman, Rob's gonna find out
we keep up this sorta
schedule.

I can see you ain't changed
a bit.

Surprised you still got
that.

Why wouldn't I? My
daughter gave it to me.

Yeah, well, listen, I just
came down here to say one
thing

And then I'll let you get
back to doing, whatever it is
that you do.

Tell Bubbs he can't
go. Listen, Mary, I...

Save it. I don't care what
you tell him, as long as he
stays.

Look, Mary... I ain't
asking, Frank.

Why do you think he comes
down here?

Because he's lookin' for
somethin'. Somethin'
bigger than himself,

Bigger than this town - bigger
than us. How do you know?

Look where he works. Here in
this Marina where folks come
and go everyday.

So why talk
to me?

I've been asking myself
that for years.

It's because I've lived my
life different than everybody,
Mary.

He's unhappy, but he won't
do nothin' about it because
he's afraid of hurtin' you.

No he ain't. He told me
today he is leaving with
you.

Well I haven't said a
word. Like hell you
didn't!

Mary, you had to've seen
this comin'. It was
inevitable.

Not until you came
along. Giving him
postcards

And filling his head with
God knows what, undermining
everything that I have done.

Why? Didn't hurt me enough,
so you gotta go through my
son?

All I have ever done is
tried to show him there's
more out there than just this!

What is wrong with
"this?" "This"is his
home.

"This" is stiflin' him,
Mary! You're stiflin' him!

I'm sorry? You're
holdin' him back!

By keeping what's left of this
family together? No, by God, by
not lettin' go!

He is all I
have.

Mary, what are you so afraid
of?

Him turning into
you.

A selfish son of a bitch
that's run from anything
resembling a responsibility,

His whole
life.

Someone who didn't know a
good thing when he had it

And someone because he's
lived alone is going to die
alone.

Now, Frank, if you've
ever thought about us,

If you've ever cared at
all,

You'll do this for me now and
you will tell Bubbs he can't
go.

Oh, c'mon, Millie, you
think I'm some kind of a
fool?

I know what kind of undershorts
I wear... and these ain't
them!

Son of a
bitch!

Didn't realize Frank
started wearin' draw's.

He doesn't. It was a
gift.

Guess you can't teach old dogs
new tricks. Guess not.



I don't know why he came
back, I really don't.

At least he picked a
different slip that son of a
bitch.

I'm telling you, Millie, if I
even see him around... Rob...

You're lucky I love you
so much.'Cause other
guys...

Can we talk about this
outside, please?

Hey, Frank, I need to talk
to you.

Look, Grant, before ya say
anything, I got in a beef
with Rob and Millie,

I saw a couple empty slips
back here, so I decided to
just move my boat around.

Ain't what I'm here about,
Frank. Rent due already? Shit,
what month is this?

Normally, Frank, I wouldn't give
a shit. You know, a guy like
you,

Every February you pay your
slip fees for the year,

You pay in cash. Whatever it
is you do, you do it well
enough,

Where I ain't gotta hear
about it.

Now aside from a dumpster
full of beer cans and

Some neighborly infidelity
and a daughter

Who bugs the shit out of me
every time she thinks
you're corrupting her son,

You're just about the best
tenant I ever had, Frank.
Listen, Mary and I...

I'm talking. It's not just
about Mary. It's about
Bubbs, too.

Whether you like it or not,
you're a part of their lives,
Frank. You ain't got the right...

Yeah - I
do.

You get right with them, both
of them, Frank. Or I'll kick
you out of my Marina for good.

Alright, have a nice
day.

Mind if I sit
down? No, have a
seat.

Know anything about some
Nicotine Patches being left
on my porch?

Outside the fact that you
ain't using them? No.

Miss you around the store.
Yeah, been busy. Gary
giving you a hard time?

No, actually, without you
there to bust him on crap,

He's regressed to saying nothing
at all. Well maybe I should stay
away then.

Well I wish to hell
you wouldn't.

Hey,
Kenny.

I'm a holler at you
later, alright?

Yeah, it's a shame about
them. How's he holding up?

I don't know. I've been
finding all sorts of stuff in
his room.

Just today I found an ad for
a job, in Key West,

With a start date of less
than two weeks away.

I don't want to tell you
your business, Mary,

But snooping around the
boy's room? It ain't right.

He won't talk to me. It's the
only way I know what's going
on.

Well that's just the way
guys are. Believe it or not,

We do have dome things
brewing up here.

Most of the time we work it
out on our own. But it's those
things that we actually say,

If we decide to say them,
that you should be paying
attention to.

I'm just worried. Before
people leave,

They give off this cold,
distant feeling like
they're severing ties with you.

Frank did it, Bubbs's father
did it and now Bubbs is
doing it.

Mary, these kids can't
stay under our roof
forever.

We do the best we can, with
what we got, then we turn
'em loose.

But they come back, they
always do.

That's why they call it
home.

Now see, you might think
that once he leaves,

You're gonna be all alone,
but that ain't the case.

I have, and I always will,
be right across the street.

I'll talk to you
later. Hayes - bye.
Bye.

Shut up. Did I say
anything?

No, but I could feel your
look.

Damn, Corey, this place's
off the chain!

Don't like it? Go somewhere
else. Easy. I'm just fuckin'
around.

Kenny, over the past two
years I've been here, you've
never come down once.

Now, over the past month,
you've been here nearly every
night,

Bitching, whining and
not tipping worth a damn.

The fuck are you talkin'
about? He never tips!

Don't worry about him. He
came with the bar.

Hate to say it, but
you're getting on our
nerves.

"Our" nerves? First of all,
Corey, we family.

We supposed to get on
each other's goddamn
nerves.

And second, I'm just tryin' to
help you out.

You know, bring
some young clientele in here.
Maybe turn this bitch out.

We think you're
hiding. "We" -

What? From
who?

Hey, I can give a shit
about him, alright?

Look, I'm just tryin' to be
a good brother and help you
out in your time of need.

Look, I appreciate you being
here in my "time of need,"

But we both know this ain't
where you want to be.

Bubbs is your boy and y'all
go back before I can
remember.

And it'd be pretty stupid to
throw that away because of

Something that happened
between he and I.

He did ya wrong,
Corey.

He's also your family
too.

And it's like you said, "We
supposed to get on your
goddamn nerves."

I'm going to kick your ass,
Frank! Alright, but no pullin'
hair this time.

Stay away from my Millie,
fucker! Eat shit, jackass!

Alright-alright,
alright-alright, break it up.
Break it up. Pussy!

I am what I eat. Rob, stop!
Jesus, man, go home! Go home!

What're you doin'? Fixin'
to give him a lesson

In street-fightin'. Ya know
that sissy tried to bite
me?

See ya around, Frank.
Look-look, Bubbs. Listen,
I wanted to apologize.

For what? Not havin' the
balls to tell me "no" to my
face?

Look, son, I know you're...
I'm not your goddamn son,
alright?

And I ain't mad,
I'm pissed.

Here I was talkin' to ya like
ya gave a damn only to get

Shit on like some kinda
fuckin' chump.

And what about Millie, huh?
I dunno what lines ya fed
her,

But ya had her wrapped
around your finger.

But did you have the decency
to be straight up with either
of us?

No, ya just left in the
night like a little bitch.

Ya know, Mama was give a
damn about yourself.

Listen, you don't know every
goddamn-thing. I had reasons for
I doin' what I did.

Oh, yeah? What are
they? That's what I
thought.

Look, I never meant to
hurt you, boy. You're the
only friend that I-

Friend? Ya know what friends
are, Frank? They're
reliable.

They're there when ya need
'em, they'll tell ya the truth

When no one else will, you can
confide in 'em

And they won't use that shit
against ya.

But you've never
been that to anybody, old
man, so fuck off!


What's going
on...

So how's
your...

Fine. You always hit like
a bitch.

Dropped yo' ass, didn't
I?

My bad, man. Shit happens
everyday and Lord knows I
ain't no saint.

Nah, man, it's my fault. I
had a great thing going and I
fucked it up.

Yeah, but I turned my back
on ya without hearin' you
out.

Ain't no need for
that.

Look, we go back since we
were terrorizin' the block on
big wheels

Sharin' yours,
at least.

And not for nothin', but
you and Corey made sense to
me.

Yeah?

I ain't blind. You two'd
go from zero to sixty

The second the other one
walks in the room.

Why ya think I brought her
out that night?

What? Bubbs, for as long as
I known you, you always been
lookin'

Off someplace else. Without
Jess, I thought you might
act on it.

It depressed
me,

So I told Corey to meet us
out that evenin'.

Figured, if she can't distract
you, no one could. But she was
with Hayes...

Any time away from that
muthafucka, is time well
spent.

What were you tryin' to
do?

Cheer you up, get your mind
off whatever it was on.

Didn't think what
happened would happen,
but it did

And I'm glad it did - if
only for a minute.

Appreciate that,
man.

So when you takin'
off?

It's
time.

You know it, I know it, we
all fuckin' know it.

Got nothin' holdin' you back
no more.

Just do whatcha gotta,
man,

And tell us all about it
when you get back.

We'll be here for
you.

Yeah, I'm callin' about
the deckhand position.

Thanks.

Double or nothing. One
week. She smokes, I lose,
you win.

That is, if you're game.
Okay. But as long as you
promise not to leave us again.

I promise.

Okay, that's fine. But that just
means the chili dog train won't
be slowing down no time soon.

A chugga-chugga-chugga -
all aboard!

All aboard the chili dog
train.

Can I get a minute,
fellas?

It's alright,
guys.

Be right outside you need
us.

I need to talk to him,
Mary.

Why don't you? Ain't like you
ever asked before. I tried, he
won't see me.

Shocking. Mary, I'm asking
for your help here.

What have you ever done to...
Look, I didn't know how much he
meant, to me,

'Til I couldn't
see him no more, alright?

Why Bubbs? I mean, how'd
you guys even meet?

Better yet, out of all the
places that you could've
gone,

Why'd you come back
here?

There was a time I wasn't
doin' too good.

Money was a mess, I'd run
my old lady off,

Government was up my ass
about some shit.

I was drinkin' a helluva
lot more than I am now.

Was thinkin' some really
awful thoughts.

I came back here because
this's the only place I
considered home.

Not because I knew it as
such, but because you did.

I didn't really have a
plan, just thought

We might run into each other
by osmosis, or who knows?

Anyway,

One day I'm nursin' a
nasty hangover,

When I see this kid fishin'
off the dock by my boat.

Couldn't have been more
than ten, twelve. Just
sittin' there, starin' off.

He sees me, asks me what
I'm lookin' at.

I told him nothin', ask
him where his Daddy was.

He says he didn't know, but his
Mama worked up at the Canoe
Shop

Name's Mary Wilson, ya know
her?

I told him not
really.

Well he sizes me up, tells
me his name's Bubbs,

Asks would I like to fish
with him. I told him sure.

Every time I come back in,
we'd find each other and do
just exactly that.

He saved me from a really
bad place, Mary.

When did you tell him about
me? Oh, early on.

Just thought he should
know. Mary, I'm gettin'
old.

I'm tired of doin' what I done
'cause I ain't got shit to
show for it.

And I just wanna get things
right - before it's too
late.

You
ain't...

Oh, no-no. I'm talkin' about the
boy.

You know, you said you're
afraid he's gonna turn out like
me.

Well I'm tellin' ya that,
that ain't gonna happen,
Mary, and you know why?

'Cause he's got
you.

The kid's head's on
straight.

No amount of talkin' I do,
is gonna change that.

I mean, not that I was
tryin' or nothin'.

So you talk, huh? What does
he say?

Ordinary stuff. Questions
mostly. He's just tryin' to
get a wrangle on things,

Like the rest of us. I will
say this, though

Keepin' up with him's been
good,

Because it's let me keep up with
you too. What would you want to
do that for?

You're,
uh,

You're still my daughter,
Mary.

I've been a pain in the ass
lately. Bubbs...

Been tryin' to figure
somethings out and

I've been takin' it out
on you and I'm sorry.

It's okay.

I'm unhappy, Ma. Have been
for awhile.

Now it ain't you and it
ain't Frank and it ain't
Corey

It's me. I'm rottin'
here.

This town, everything. I need
a change.

You have something in
mind?

It's for a deckhand job on a
private fishin' boat. They
take folks out, show 'em around.

They go all
over.

I called and they said if
I want it, job's mine.

So what's the
problem?

They run outta the Keys and
I'd have to report next
week.

Listen, Bubbs, I've been
a hypocrite.

For years I've been telling
you how selfish Frank is

When I've been guilty of
worse.

Ma, no, he left just like
you said he would.

Only 'cause I asked him
to.

What?

I thought he was a bad
influence. That he was
the reason for everything.

But I was
wrong.

You are your own person and
you are stronger than that.

It's me that's, you
know... Ma - Ma, don't -
don't...

I just thought if you
stayed, everything would be
okay.

Well that worked for me,
but not for you.

It's unfair for you to have
to deal with my past.

I mean, that's something I
need to come to terms with.

And, you know, you have always
had that wandering spirit,
just like your Grandfather.

You needed something from
him that I just couldn't
give you

And you know
what?

I'm glad you found each
other. Seems like it's done
you both some good.

So what I'm trying to
say...

Is if this is something
that you need to do

I'm fine with it.

But I need you to do
something for me first.

Takin' off?

Nah - just cleanin'.

Packed this ol' girl to
the gills over the years.

Ain't gettin' rid of that, are
ya? No-no.

Matter of fact, I cracked
that book you gave me.

Listen to this. I've been
practicin'. [Guitar Strums]

The hell was that?

"Mommas Don't Let Your
Babies Grow Up To Be
Cowboys."

Keep practicin'.

You know, y'all were right about
me. Frank, Mama told me...

Ah, that don't make any
difference. I am selfish, always
have been.

You know, at the end of the
day, it's how ya treated folks

That counts. Well I treated
'em like shit and it shows.

Bankin' on "better late
than never,"

'Cause that's all I got
left.

I lived my life exactly how
I wanted.

I've enjoyed the spoils
and there's been a few,

But I've also burned a lot
of bridges along the way.

The one I never intended to
burn was the one between me
and you.

What makes us any
different?

Ya kept me connected, ya
kept me engaged. Shoot, ya
kept me alive.

This may sound corny as
hell,

But ya reminded me of the
little

Good I done here - your
Mama, which led to you.

I thank ya for
that.

To show you my
appreciation, I'm givin' ya
my boat.

What? She's yours, son. You
deserve her.

Frank, I-I-I can't take
this. This's your home.
This's what ya do.

Nah, not anymore. I'm
retirin'.

I got my stories,
son.

You get
yours.

Taking the deckhand job,
huh? Yeah, well I was, until
Frank gave me his boat.

Frank gave you his boat? Son
of a bitch.

Well, hell, I wouldn't take
the job either.

Hey, how'd you know about
that deckhand thing?

Now who do you think I put
that up on the board for, huh?
Millie?

And the
books?

Why didn't ya ever say
nothin'?

I just figured you'd get
there on your own time.

Besides, if I said something,
would you have listened?
Probably not.

Probably not. Grant, I just
want you to know I appreciate
it.

It was my pleasure. You
take care of yourself, huh?

Alright, you
too.

We'll talk about this
later. Hayes - Hayes?

What?

Folks show you how they
are, Corey. Believe 'em.

What are you doing
here?

Wanted to say
goodbye.

So tomorrow,
huh? Yeah...

Know where you're going? I
gotta couple ideas. Probably
decide in the mornin', though.

Know when you'll be
back?

Yeah, I don't blame
you.

Corey, I just wanna say
that I'm...

Bubbs - I know. Me
too.



Mr. Brownlee.
Now he I
liked.



What's goin' on? I
couldn't wait to see you.



lies, I swear.

See you on
board?

Ooh, nicely
done... Easy, ol'
timer.

Alright, now times've
changed since the last time
you were behind the wheel,

So don't be stoppin' at every
bar along the way, alright?

Ain't had the truck two seconds
and you're already takin' all
the fun out.

You do still have a valid
license, don't ya?
Alright-alright,

I won't stop at any
bars.

Frank, man, I just want you to
know that... You're welcome, son.

And thank you.

Be good, huh?
You know I won't.
