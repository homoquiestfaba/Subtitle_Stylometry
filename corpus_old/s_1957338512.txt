[Suspenseful music returns]

Hey mom I thought
you'd be home later.

How was dinner?

Mom?

[Monster bass blares]

[Katie grunts]

[Action theme begins]

[Car beeps]

[Glass cuts flesh]

[Monster bass blares]

[Car Door Slams]

No, please!

You think anyone will
even show up tonight?

You know, with what
happened to Katie?

Well we're going but yeah it's definitely
gonna be a different vibe than usual.

I feel like there probably
won't be as many girls as usual.

Yeah but let's face it, it's
usually mostly dudes there anyways.

But yeah now that
you mention it,

with the possibility of a
psycho killer out on the loose,

I'm sure girls aren't exactly
rushing out to get fucked up

with a bunch of
hormone-filled teenage dudes.

You really think
Katie was murdered?

She might've just run away.

Yeah but she didn't really say anything to
her friends about, you know being unhappy

or wanting to run away
or anything like that.

Plus, she's kind of not
that type of girl, you know?

Well speaking of girls
that run away from home,

you think Jane's
gonna show up tonight?

I mean no because she
just got out of rehab,

but damn near she would.

JAMES: - Is that it?

TYLER: I think so, ready
to go get shitfaced?

Do I have a choice?

["Gull Wing Doors" by YBG

â™ª There was days I was down,
now I'm up and I'm flexin'...

TYLER: Sup, ayyy, what's good!

I'm gonna make us something to get
caught up with these dudes, yeah?

["Gull Wing Doors" fades away]

What's in it?

TYLER: - Rum and coke with
a little something extra.

That's disgusting.

Gets better the more you drink.

["Kobe" fades into
the background]

Hey, do you know
where the bathroom is?

PARTYGOER: - Yeah, it's like
down that hall to the right.

JAMES: - Alright, thanks.

JAMES: Oh shit, sorry!

JANE: James, is that you?

JAMES: Yeah, who's that?

JANE: It's Jane.

Jane!

I missed you so much!

Dude, why are you wet?

Oh my bad, this dude out
there spilled his beer on me,

so I'm just trying
to get the stain out.

[Faucet opens]

Yeah, that's not gonna come out.

Did you bring a
change of clothes?

I mean I got a hoodie in my bag.

So uh rehab, how was that?

It was pretty chill,

made some new friends
and it was just nice

to get away from everything.

Looks like you kinda missed the
point of the whole experience.

That was never the point for me,

I just needed some
time away from my mom

and rehab gave me that time.

Well are you guys okay now?

Definitely not, but
it's whatever, you know?

Yeah I feel that. Did
I interrupt anything?

No no no! I'm glad you found me.

I was just in here because it's
quiet and when I was out there

I felt like everyone
was staring at me.

I mean, to be fair, you're damn
near the only girl at this party.

Yeah true. Give it a month.

Everyone's just hella paranoid
right now 'cause of Katie.

Yeah, what do you
think happened to her?

[Phone rings]

Yeah? Yeah, I'll be right out.

Sorry, my ride's
here. I gotta go.

Where are you going?

None of your business.

Oh wait before I head out,

lemme get a shot for the road.

Aight, bet.

What's the toast?

To... suppressing your
issues with alcohol!

Okay, I really do got to go now.

All right, it's been good.

It has.

TYLER (echoing): James
we gotta get out of here.

Come on,

we gotta leave.

James we gotta go bro,
cops are here let's go.

You good?

Yeah I'm fine.

Alright, we gotta leave through
the back just to be safe.

No homo though.

Oh shit bro, Jane
left her bag here.

TYLER: - Just grab it,

we can get it to her later.

Aight,

let's go.


Sounds like it was
a false alarm bro.

Someone saw a cop car go past but
they were going to a different house.

Swear, what's the move now?

I mean party's damn near dead.

Did you see Jane?

Nah bro, she already left.

Oh shit, yeah you right.

Well what do we do
with her bag then?

Uh, we could just like
drop it at her house later.

Aight yeah that's
damn near the move,

a little walk sounds
hella nice right now.

Uh I mean, I meant
like, tomorrow,

but yeah fuck it
let's bust a mission.

TYLER: Bro, and then I took
the fattest rip off this bong,

and I was just out bro.

Like, I don't even know
how to describe it.

It's just a majestic experience
bro. I was just vibing and then...

Holy shit.

[Police chatter on radio]

TYLER: That's
Jane's house right?

Yeah, do you think
something happened to her?

TYLER: Shit, get down. Get down!

I'm really not trying to
deal with cops right now bro.

Me neither bro.

Did Jane seem
normal at the party?

I think so, she
left kinda quick.

Said someone was
giving her a ride.

It was probably her new mans.

She datin' someone?

Yeah you know Bryan?

Which one?

Bryan Daniels?

Nah.

Aight well, he's the plug,

and apparently, they met in
rehab and got hella close.

Who is he, like is he dangerous?

Nah not really, he's the homie.

I mean he's a little old
to be dating her though.

Like it's not illegal or
anything but it's close.

Like, hella close.

But he doesn't really seem like the
kidnapping type to me, you know?

Okay well the cops
are at her house

so something has
clearly gone wrong.

Yeah once the cops leave
let's just stop in,

see if she's there.

Yeah I bet her mom just freaked out again
because she snuck out to go to a party

like three days after
getting back from rehab.

Yeah probably, it's
worth checking though.

Yeah I guess.

Hey, looks like the
cops are leaving.

Let's go.

Alright hold up,
give me the bag.

If Jane's mom is in there, we
got to be discreet with the bag.

We don't want to
get her in trouble

in case there's
anything bad in here.

Aight yeah, good idea.

[James knocks]

Oh hey boys,

isn't it a little
late for a visit?

Hey Ms. Booker, we
were just wondering if

we could say hi to Jane
real quick. Is she around?

You know she's
actually gone missing?

I mean it's only been
a couple of hours,

but she just got back from rehab

and I'm trying to keep
her on a tight leash.

She's probably okay but.

I just really need
her home tonight.

Oh jeez, I'm so
sorry Ms. Booker.

We didn't even realize,

I mean she's probably
fine, you know?

Maybe she doesn't even know
you're looking for her?

She hasn't been answering
any of my calls!

It's not like her,

at least

it's not like the Jane
that came back from rehab.

It seemed to me that
she was all better.

She wasn't like her old self.

She was ready to move on,

and now she's just gone
with no explanation.

It's just so troubling,

especially with everything going
on with that poor Katie girl.

I'm just really
worried right now.

Us too, is there anything
we can do to help?

Actually yeah.

Um...

The cops wanted me to ask her
friends a couple questions.

If you guys wouldn't mind it
would only take a couple minutes?

Uh yeah sure, we
could do that, right?

Yeah alright,

but we probably don't know anything
you haven't already figured out.

It won't take long.

So I take it you haven't
seen Jane recently,

otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, right?

Oh well actually.

Yeah, we haven't seen her
since she left for rehab.

Were you gonna say
something James?

Oh uh no.

Well, yeah actually.

I was gonna say I visited
her once in rehab.

Oh that's right,

you two were always so close,

but you haven't seen
her recently, right?

Yes that's correct.

And do you know
her new boyfriend?

I think his name is Bryan?

Yeah, Bryan um...

Sounds familiar, I
might have heard of him,

but I don't think I know
him personally or anything.

He seems like trouble to me.

I've heard Jane on
the phone with him.

He just doesn't treat her
with the respect she deserves.

What do you mean?

After their calls,
I can always tell,

because Jane seems
anxious and distracted.

Do you know this
Bryan's last name?

I can't seem to identify
him to the police,

but he seems like a
prime suspect to me.

I want to say it
starts with like a b?

But like I really
couldn't say for sure.

I mean I wish I did, but

Jane hasn't even
mentioned him to me.

Hmm, she can be like that.

She hides herself from others.

Anyway,

what's the talk like in your
circles about Katie's disappearance?

Like, what are people
your age saying?

Well,

no one really knows
what to make of it,

everyone's definitely
on edge though.

Do the cops think this is
related to Katie's disappearance?

It's only logical for the
two of them to be connected.

Two girls disappearing within
the same week of each other?

In this town?

It just makes sense.

Yeah, I mean it's kind of
important to remember that...

Jane and Katie were two very
different kind of girls.

MS. BOOKER: How so?

TYLER (muffled): Well you know, they just
lived very different sort of lifestyles.

You know what I'm
talking about James?


TYLER (muffled): -Yo James?


MS. BOOKER (muffled):
James are you okay?

[Vomit splashes]

[James retches]

Fuck!

[Knock knock knock]

MS. BOOKER: Are you okay James?

Yup I'm fine Ms. Booker,

I'm just a little sick.

Fuck I gotta get out of here.

[Muffled voice downstairs]

[Running Water]

You know you really
have to be careful.

I'm sorry?

With alcohol,

it's obvious you two
have been drinking.

Did you know that Jane, like
her father, was an alcoholic?

That's why she went to rehab.

I used to think I knew her.

I had a whole plan of
how to raise her right.

She was gonna be perfect.

Then, after her father left,

I had to make sure she didn't
follow in his footsteps.

But I didn't do enough.

By the time I found out
she'd started drinking,

her alcoholism had eroded
away the girl I had raised.

I'm really sorry Ms. Booker.

I didn't mean to.

Were you guys with her,
when she started drinking?

Did you pressure her?

No no Ms. Booker that wasn't us,

we would never do that.

Were you gonna get
her drunk tonight?

Is that why you came here?

No no, absolutely not!

Hey James, I think it's
time we start heading out.

Yeah, our parents are probably
expecting us home soon.

Boys, I.

I still have more questions!

Uh sorry we really have to go!

Open it!

[Door closes]

Fuck bro that was hella sus!

You good?

Yeah, I feel better now.

When I was in the bathroom,

did you hear anything weird?

Like what?

I feel like I heard
Jane downstairs.

She sounded distressed.

You know now that
you mention it,

I feel like I heard
something too,

but why would Jane be missing

if she's just down in her room?

I don't know.

It definitely sounded
like her though.

Doesn't Jane have a sister?

Oh shit yeah, she does.

It's probably just
her sister then,

I bet Jane's
chilling with Bryan,

I'll try calling him
to make sure though.

[Phone rings]

[Inaudible Dialogue From Phone]

Hey Bryan, we just.

[Bryan hangs up]

Huh, that's weird.

He hung up on me.

He's never hung up on me.

He sounded different
than usual too, like

I don't know, more serious?

Do you think he could
be hurting Jane?

I don't know, probably
not but like maybe?

If he's hurting her
we gotta act quick.

Where does he live?

Oh dude he's like
three miles from here.

He lives close to the school.

We gotta get there now.

You good to drive?

Hell nah bro, I'm faded as fuck.

This ain't the move.

Can't we just go back to my place
and figure it out in the morning?

No! Jane could be
dead by the morning,

we gotta get there now!

Alright how are we
gonna get there?

We could take an Uber?

Hell nah bro, I'm broke as
fuck, can't we just walk?

No that'll take too long.

We could run though.

Fuck it let's go.

[Footsteps slowly
become distant]

TYLER (distant): Oh God, oh God.

Fuck that bro.

[Car engine runs]

Thanks for the ride!

You're welcome!
Hey, stay safe guys.

You better pay me back
for half of that ride.

Yeah yeah I will, but can
we focus on why we're here?

Yeah I know. I just don't want
you to forget like last time.

Besides, remind me of
why we're here again?

Is it because you want to save Jane,
your little damsel in distress?

She'll love you forever,

maybe you'll get to second base?

No, you know I don't
like her like that.

This is about
doing what's right.

Yeah, wouldn't
doing what's right,

just mean calling the cops?

Maybe?

Well listen, we're here,

and in the interest of time,

we might as well
just go check it out.

Besides, you've seen
all those movies

where the cops can't even spot a crime
when it happens right under their noses.

We need some
irrefutable evidence.

Exactly, let's go.

[Screams from inside]

Wait, do you hear that?

Oh shit.

If we knock we'll
give ourselves away.

Is there a back door?

I don't know, probably.

Let's go check.

[Suspenseful music fades in]

[Door quietly opens]

[Intense music fades away]

[Screaming gets louder]

Dude, we're kinda unarmed.

I'll check in the
kitchen for some knives.

Good idea.

Yo check this out! You want one?

TYLER: Yeah go ahead
and grab me one.

Real mature dude.

I swear that's all there was.

[Screaming gets louder]

[Screaming is from television]

[Screaming stops]

What the fuck are
you doing here?

Let her go!

Oh shit, my bad Bryan.

James, he didn't kidnap her,
they were just hanging out.

Yeah, no shit Sherlock.

Oh fuck.

What are you guys doing here?

We thought he kidnapped you and
we were gonna try to save you.

No no, I'm fine.

Is this because I
hung up on you Tyler?

I mean yeah, that
was part of it.

The cops were at
your house Jane.

Your mom said you were
missing, and we got worried

'cause we didn't want
you to end up like Katie.

You guys are so far off.

Why were you talking to my mom?

Well, we went to your house
to bring you your bag.

I told you I left
it at the party.

Okay well, you guys are forgiven
for interrupting our movie night

because we really
needed this bag.

What's in it?

Everything I need to
get away from my mom.

Is that a burner phone?

Yeah, her mom tracks her
iPhone when we're together

so she just puts it
on airplane mode.

I got her that so she could still have
a working phone while not being tracked.

What else is in there?

Just my hydro, a flashlight, and
some other things I wanted from home.

So you're moving in with Bryan?

Nah, it ain't really like that

yet.

I just really needed to get
away from my mom for the night

cause ever since I got back
from rehab she's been like,

more psycho than normal.

Yeah we kind of got that vibe
when we were talking to her.

Did she mention to you that
she's converted to Satanism?

And not the hipster fucking
freedom of religion kind.

No, she just went full on hail Satan
let me drink goat blood and shit.

She did not mention that.

Oh, oh, and there's a very high chance
she was going to perform a satanic ritual

on me tonight.

How do you know?

[Suspenseful music begins]

MS. BOOKER: Dinner is served!

[Suspenseful music fades away]

Are you gonna untie me,

or do I just get to
stare at my food?

Patience is a
virtue my daughter,

you'll get your food.
But first, I need to eat.

I've worked up quite an appetite
setting up for your big day.

Yes, my big day,

the one where you tie me
up and tell me nothing

about what the fuck is going on.

Think of it as your final
step of rehabilitation.

I'm clean mom.

Whatever this is
it, isn't necessary.

Mm.

I'm sure you think you're clean,

but you still reek of
your past transgressions.

Now, open up!

Tonight, you will be granted
the gift of a fresh start,

a second chance at the
life you were destined for!

You're gonna need your energy,

so open up and let's
get this over with.

[Jane spits]

Fuck that and fuck you.

How can you treat
your mother like this?

BOOKER: After everything
I've done for you?

I've sacrificed the last 18 years of my life so
you could turn into a woman I could be proud of.

And now it seems like you're actively
trying to derail your entire life!

Look, I know you're
a rebellious teen,

but as your mother, I
know what's best for you.

And what's best for me
is tying me to a chair

and sacrificing me to the devil?

Or whatever you have planned
with your Satan buddies tonight.

If only you could
realize your potential,

I wouldn't have to do
everything for you!

[Intense music begins]

[Monster bass hit]

I can't have you messing tonight
up with that mouth of yours.

Wait wait wait!

What?

I have to pee.

Can you hold it?

No!

Okay, but I have to watch you.

I can't risk you
running off like before.

I understand.

[Box cutter cuts restraints]

Now, you do the other ones.

[Jane removes leg restraints]

[Intense music stops]

[Jane coughs]

Are you okay?

[Mace sprays]

[Ms. Booker screams]

[Intense Music Returns]

[Door locks]

[Doorknob shakes]

Ugh.

[Garage door opens]

[Car drives off]

[Intense Music Ends]

Holy shit, okay.

We definitely gotta
call the cops.

No we can't do that.

Why not?

Because it's my word
against my mom's.

No one would believe me.

Especially since I've lied to
cops before to get away from her.

Wait, when was that?

After my dad disappeared,

I genuinely thought
my mom had killed him.

But I didn't have any proof,

so I made up a story about
how I'd seen her kill him.

I said that I saw
her strangle him,

in his sleep, and

take the body outside in
the backyard and bury it.

The cops excavated
our entire backyard

but they never found anything.

I never said I made it up, but

it was obvious they all knew.

Then my mom sued the
police department,

and they paid to have our
entire backyard fixed,

so if I were to call them
up with this kind of story,

they would think it was
the same kind of thing,

and without any evidence,
they'd have to believe her.

Hey Bryan,

while I'm here,

you think I could get
an eighth real quick?

Oh uh yeah sure, I guess.

I got my shit in my room.

Let's go.

So there's no way we can stop
your mom without evidence?

I mean she needs me for whatever
she has planned tonight,

so as long as I'm with
Bryan I'll be safe.

She knows you're dating
someone named Bryan.

She doesn't know his last name,

but I feel like it's
only a matter of time

until the cops figure out
that you're staying here.

Shit.

She uh said something else too.

What is it?

She said she thought
Bryan was bad for you,

that he wasn't
treating you right.

Fuck her.

She doesn't know
anything about me.

She was probably just
trying to manipulate you,

that's what she does.

And also who is she to
talk about mistreatment?

She duct-taped me
to a fucking chair.

Bryan is

kind.

I know you guys don't
know him very well yet,

but you'll see.

He's legitimately a great guy.

Yeah, I believe you.

This is stupid.

Like, we just need some evidence
of your mom trying to hurt you,

then we can take it to the cops

and you'll be safe, right?

Yeah great idea,

let's just go see my mom,

and you guys can film while
she sacrifices me to the devil.

Sounds like a plan.

No like what if we got someone
else to back up your story.

Like your sister.

Was she home when
this was happening?

Nah James, my
sister goes to UCLA,

she won't be home till summer.

Swear?

I definitely heard a girl
downstairs when we visited.

You probably just heard the cat,

no one else lives there.

What if it was Katie?

I mean, think about it.

What if your mom needed Katie for
the ritual that she's planning,

and so she kidnapped her.

That's insane.

This whole thing's insane,

but I heard the same girl too.

There's definitely
someone in that house.

She could be the
evidence you need,

and if she's there,

we'll be the people
who saved Katie Dawson.

You will,

I'll be the one whose mom
kidnapped Katie Dawson.

But if she is there,

she needs our help.

How are we going to save her?

We need to get my
mom out of the house

so then someone can go
in and rescue Katie.

[Calming music begins]

Well, she is after you.

You're not gonna use me as bait.

[Calm music continues]

Are you sure there's no
better way to do this?

Don't worry,

there is no chance that
she's gonna see us.

All we have to do
is stay hidden,

and we'll be fine.

[Monster bass blares]

Are you gonna be okay?

I think so.

[Phone keyboard clicks]

[Calm music ends]

[Tyler's phone vibrates]

Is it from Bryan?

Yeah, get ready.

[Phone keyboard clicks]

[Bryan's phone dings]

Okay they're at the house.

You ready to do this?

Yeah.

Alright, let's go.

[Intense music begins]

[Monster bass blares]

[Intense music continues]

[Booker's phone dings]

Her phone came back online,

it says she's at the school.

Meet me there in five minutes.

[Monster bass blares repeatedly]

Let's go.

Yo what the fuck.

That's some actual satanic
ritual shit right there.

Yeah yeah, lemme get a picture
real quick for evidence.

Aight, but we got
to stay focused.

[Camera clicks]

Shit.

What?

Phone died.

It's all good.

I still have some charge.

Yo Jane said there's
a sliding door

that's always unlocked, right?

Yeah.

Wait, we gotta be quiet.

Why?

If the person in
there isn't Katie,

we don't need them
knowing we're here.

[Bryan's phone dings]

They're in the house.

We should go.

We're too close to the phone.

There's too much light here.

Yeah but there's no way
she'll see us from there

Bryan, Bryan, listen to me,

this is stupid
and we need to go.

Okay you're right.

Okay.

Do you need a hand?

Shh!

BRYAN: - Oh shit.

Okay okay. Back to
the hiding spot!

[Action theme begins]

Good to see you.

It says my daughter's
phone is in the main yard.

I need you to find her,

but I need her unharmed.

That said, if she's with anyone,

they're all yours.

Now get to work.

[Action theme intensifies]

[Monster bass hit]

[Action theme ends]

Hey Siri,

call Bryan.

SIRI: -Calling Bryan.

[Bryan's phone rings]

[Action theme returns]

Jane,

run!


[Whack!]

[Neck cracks]



[Bryan screams In pain]

[Flesh rips]

[Arm thuds]

BRYAN: Oh fuck.

[Bonk!]


Come on, let's get
you out of here.

[Monster bass hit]

[Monster bass hit]

[Monster bass hit]

[Monster bass hit]


[Stab!]

Bryan, Bryan, Bryan!
Get up! Get up!

[Bam!]

[Music ends]

What the hell?

I told you not to hurt her!

You could have killed her
with a punch like that!

You incompetent shit.

Load her up.

I gotta get her home.

No one's home.

Why are you looking in here?

We've looked everywhere else.

Maybe Jane isn't
telling us everything?

I guess.

[Distant thud]

The fuck was that?

I don't know.

It sounded like it came
from that room over there.

Let's check that room again.
It looks like we missed something.

[Ominous ambience]

There's nothing to miss in here.

It's just a washing
machine and some junk.

[Muffled female voice]

TYLER: Yeah, that was
definitely nothing.

[Tyler grunts]

[James knocks]

WOMAN (muffled):
Help me, please!

JAMES: - Holy Shit.

We gotta get in there.

How do you even open a lock?

I saw a video where a guy used
liquid nitrogen to break one.

Do we have liquid nitrogen?

Nope.

What's another way
we could open a lock?

Well, if we shoot it with
a gun it'll probably break.

Do we have a gun?

Nope.

What's a realistic way
we could open a lock?

We could use the key.

Do we have the key?

Yep.

Where'd you get that?

It was on the hook
right over there.

Well shit okay.
Let's open this thing up.

[Lock clicks]

I'm not going in there.

Move aside. We don't
have much time.

[Tyler grunts]

Can you see anyone?

TYLER: - I can't see shit.

It's pitch-fucking-black.

Hold on, I think I
found a light switch.

[Light clicks on]

Katie?

Please get me out of here!

Get me out of here!

Here!

[Duct tape rips]

Get me out of here now.

Jane's Mom is a psycho.
She's gonna kill me!

KATIE: You!

James, call the cops now!

[Intense music begins]

[Garage door opens above]

(whispers) Tyler, we have to go.
Ms. Booker's here!

Ah shit. Oh fuck.

Uh. Uh.

[Intense music continues]

[Car door slams]

[Car door slams]

[Car door opens]

[Monster bass blares]

Alright, give her to me.

Go get the other girl.


We don't have enough time to
get those cuffs off of her!

We won't let her hurt you.

KATIE: No!

[Duct-tape muffles
Katie's words]

[Door slams shut]

[Music intensifies]

[Slow, heavy footsteps
come from above]

[Intense music fades away]

[Footsteps approach]

MS. BOOKER: While you're down
there can you grab my knife?

[Quiet footsteps]

[Intense music returns]

[Sliding door slams]

[Monster bass blares]


I left my phone in there!

[Handcuffs unlock]

[Monster bass blares]


[Monster bass blares]

[Quiet footsteps]

That was close.

Too fucking close.

Let's get outta here.

Aight, let me grab
my phone real quick.

[Ominous guitar music begins]

JANE (distant): I'm
gonna kill you, Mom!

Go. Go. Go!

[Ominous guitar music
fades to background]

TYLER (panting):
The fuck was that?

They got my phone.

Shit.

And, they got Jane.

How do you know?

I heard Jane's voice
come from upstairs.

Ugh, did you hear Bryan?

No.

Our only hope now,

is that my call went through and
can be traced back to this house.

Otherwise, we're fucked.

KATIE (muffled): Fuck you,
you crazy, Satanic bitch!

Get me the fuck out of here!

You're fucking insane!

You're fucking insane.

[Ominous guitar
music fades away]

Ugh...

If you don't tell me
whose phone this is,

I swear I'll.

You're gonna what?

You've taken everything from me.

There's nothing else
for you to take.

[Police siren whoops]

Shit!

[Ominous guitar music returns]

[Police radio chatter]

[Car door slams]

Help! Help me.

[Muffled screams]

Holy shit.
Your call actually worked.

I can't believe it.

[Radio beeps]

Dispatch this is Coltrane, I'm
in front of the Booker house now.

I'll keep you posted.

DISPATCH: - Roger that, Officer.

[Radio beeps off]

[Officer Coltrane knocks]

Officer Coltrane

what can I do for you?
Any word from Jane?

Unfortunately, no.

But, we did get a phone call from
near this area. Was that you?


[Ms. Booker laughs]

Did the caller say anything?

Nothing coherent, but we like
to check these things out.

You never know what
you're gonna find.

Uh.

[Relieved laugh]

You know what? (Chuckles)

I think I butt-dialed 9-1-1.

Oh my God, that's so
embarrassing. (Chuckles)

Would you mind if
I looked around?

Just to make sure nothing's going
on. It's just standard protocol.

Of course.

[Intense music]

So, have you heard
anything from Jane?

No.

Don't worry, we will
find your daughter.

[Intense music continues]

[Holster unclips]

[Curtains screech]

[Muffled screams]

FREEZE! Get down!


[Body thuds]

[Intense music fades
to the background]

Aw shoot.

I just had this rug cleaned.

Can you deal with this mess?

And make sure nobody misses him.

[Intense music continues
in the background]

[Radio chirps]

DISPATCH (over radio): - Dispatch to
Coltrane, what're we dealing with?

[Radio static]

[Knife slices flesh]

[Music intensifies]

[Blood squishes]

BUTCHER (using Coltrane's voice):
False alarm. It was just a buttdial.

Nothing to see.

I'm feeling a little
sick though, so

I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

[Radio clicks off]

DISPATCH: - I'll tell Richardson
he's on his own tonight.

Hope you feel better
tomorrow Coltrane.

[Radio beeps]

BUTCHER: Me too.

Over and out.

[Radio clicks off]

[Blood squishes]

[Intense music fades away]

Now that we're free
of distractions,

it's almost time to begin.

Your purification in
the eyes of my lord.

Mom,

please let Katie go.

She doesn't deserve to be here.
She's never done anything wrong.

[Booker scoffs]

No.

That's not gonna happen.

She's the only thing
that needs to be lost,

in order for you to
be re-sanctified.

Satan has shown me a
way forward for you.

A way where you can fulfill
your primary purpose in life

and become my successor
in the Satanic Order.

KATIE (muffled): - Crazy bitch.

Why are you doing this to me?

Why not make Jessica
the next great Satanist?

[Booker scoffs]

Your sister is motivated.

She knows what she wants
and she knows how to get it.

You want to be a
broke alcoholic.

I won't let that happen.

I don't want to
be your successor!

You don't know what
the fuck you want!

I know what's best for you.

When you're left on your own,

you give in to your most

primitive, juvenile desires.

I'm just trying to set
you up for a good life.

And you're doing a
great job of that.

And for the record, I didn't
give in to my desires.

It was either that or you
would drive me insane.

I chose sanity.

You clearly didn't.

[Ms. Booker chuckles]

How can any mother stay sane?

Raising you was hell.

You drove your father and I further
apart, more than anything else.

This ritual will cleanse you

and give you a second chance.

Please, take it.

I don't want shit from you.

You just don't understand.

All of this

is going to help you become

the woman you're meant to be.

Why do you get to decide
the woman I'm meant to be?

Because I'm your mother!

Whether you like it or not,

everything you do
is because of me.

You formed your whole identity
as a response to mine.

The way you talk,
the way you dress,

the guys you fuck.

Without me,

you wouldn't be you.

[Footsteps approach]

Can you finish setting up?

I need to get this
ritual over with.

Tonight has been such a mess.

[Door opens]

[Door slams]

JAMES: - It's all on us now.

What're we gonna do?

We have to stop the ritual.

I told Katie we weren't
gonna leave her.

Yeah sure, but how?

If Jane's mom is killing cops, what
gonna stop her from killing us?

I don't know, but I'm not just
gonna leave her with them.

Are you?

[Water splashes]

Now,

This ritual will begin the
process of your repurification.

By the end,

You'll be as good as new.

What does Katie even
have to do with this?

Don't you see?

Katie is our sacrifice.

She's pure, unlike you,

and will be the perfect
gift to appease my lord.

Leave her alone.

You know,

if you weren't
such a catastrophe,

Katie wouldn't have to die.

This is all your fault.

You already killed Bryan,

and that cop.

Just, please,

stop this.

The ritual won't fix anything,
it'll just make everything worse.

They wouldn't have had to
die, if you didn't run off!

If you had just stayed here,

Katie would be the only one

dying tonight.

Fuck you.

Just...

Just calm down.

Just let me finish
this damn ritual

and everything will be alright.

How will everything be right?

Nothing's been right
since Dad left.

Oh, things were going
wrong long before he left.

You know Dad didn't leave
because of me, right?

Before he left, he told
me to never trust you.

He said that you would
always put yourself,

and your desires,
above everyone else.

[Ms. Booker laughs]

[Ms. Booker inhales]

No.

No, no, no, no, no.

Baby,

I prioritize the Satanic
Order above everything else.

I'm a selfless being.

Your father, on the other
hand, was a needy distraction.

That's why I choose to.

MS. BOOKER: Sacrifice him

to Satan at my coronation.

And the same goes
for your friends,

if they get in my
way, I'll kill them.

Their resistance will
just lead to more death.

Okay, so the ritual is
prolly in the backyard,

'cause that's where the
black pentagram was, right?

Yeah, we're gonna need some weapons if
we wanna stand a chance against Satan.

What, you think Satan
himself will be there?

I don't know, but we gotta
prepare like he will be bro.

[Tyler pounds chest]

Okay, but we gotta prep
hella quick though,

cause we don't know when
the ritual's gonna start.

It's like ten
minutes to midnight.

I'd say that's a safe bet.

True.

Then, all we need is
some weapon and a plan.

I think I know where we
can find some weapons.

[Ominous guitar music begins]

Wait, what about a plan?

Fuck a plan.

Just use your brain
and improvise.

[Music is deafening]

[Music abruptly ends]

TYLER: I saw these tools
lying around earlier

and I was thinking
about stealing them.

I mean for real, who just leaves
their shit out in the open like this?

It's a safe neighborhood.

My family does that too.

Also, be quiet
they could hear us.

I'm robbin' yo house after this.

Bruh, shut up.

[Tools clank]

[Guitar music returns]

Are you sure you can hurt
someone with that thing?

Hundred percent.

[Electric guitar
music is deafening]

[Footsteps above]

[Door slides]

[Music fades to background]

What're you waiting for?

Let's get started.

The fuck is wrong with Jane?

[Duct-tape muffles
Katie's screams]

[Spike pierces skin]

[Spike crushes bone]

[Katie continues to scream]

We need to do something
before he kills here.

Not yet.

[Spike pierces skin]

[Hammer slams spike]

[Music cuts out]

nocte congressi sumus

ut tibi virginem,
Katie, sacrificemus.

Postquam hoc sacrificium
completum est,

te imploro ut filia mea, Jane,

de peccatis eius purificata,
in tempore futuro nos ducat.

Ave Satana!

[Ominous ambience]

Jane, give me your hand.

[Dagger slices flesh]

Something is definitely
wrong with Jane.

[Katie squirms]

What are we waiting for?

We'll be killed
if we go too soon.

Trust me.

What is that?

Goat blood.

ad te pietas mea...

They'll be dead, if we
don't do something soon.

Shut up and wait.

What are we waiting for?

Shhhh!

Fuck it. I'm going.

Bro I'm telling you,
this is not the move.

James. James!

[Heroic music plays]

[Ms. Booker continues reciting
lyrics In the background]


[Heroic music peaks]

[Quiet footsteps]

[Twig snaps]

[Music cuts out]

Is someone hiding back there?

[Loud footsteps]

[Shovel strikes dirt]

Oh hey Ms. Booker,

I uh heard some noise and
thought I'd come down,

check it out, and make
sure you guys are all okay.

Is THIS your big plan?

Nah, we don't really have one.

Oh look, you found Jane!

Oh and Katie!

Dope. And you're sacrificing
her to the devil. That's...

Hooray!

You two need to leave, now!

We aren't leaving here
without you and Katie.

Yeah so, it looks like you
have everything under control.

I'm just gonna head
out here real quick.

[Hurried footsteps]

Get him!

[Action theme begins]

Get away from my daughter!

Stay away from him!


Go help Tyler!

[Action theme continues]

[Monster bass blares]

[Tyler chokes]

[Shovel clangs]

[Monster bass blares]

[Shears clatter]

Tyler!

[Shears stab]

[The Butcher
shrieks unnaturally]


[Action theme quiets down]

Let Katie go! You're done!

Don't you see?

This is just another disruption.

All this means is that more
of your friends are gonna die,

because of you!

Now, if you don't mind, I'm
gonna finish this damn ritual!

[Action theme rises]


[Monster bass blares]

Back the fuck up!

Don't touch those!

We can't turn back now.

If we don't sacrifice her,
Satan will take us all.

If we don't finish
this, we're dead!

Yeah, I think we'll
be fine, thanks.

I'm gonna go call the cops.

[The Butcher
shrieks in distance]

Shit.

Stay here.

[Music becomes foreboding]

[Muffled fighting]

[Tyler's body thuds]

[Tyler groans]



[Tyler grunts]

[Action theme returns]


[Tyler continues grunting]



[Tyler continues stabbing]


[Blade slices]

[Tyler struggles]

[Blade stabs Tyler]

[Tyler groans]

[Foreboding theme returns]

[Tyler struggles]

[Flesh ripping]

[Body thuds]

[Monster bass blares]

[Monster bass blares]



[Monster bass blares]

[Monster bass blares]

[Monster bass blares]

[Blade slices flesh]

[Head thuds]

[Monster bass blares]

[Body thuds]

What happened?

It's all over now.

Is Katie okay?

She went to call the cops.
She should be done by now.

What about your mom?

She's in the back.

I'll go keep an eye on her
till the cops get here.


[Emotional music begins]

Bryan?

Jane?

I thought you were dead.

What the hell?

Bryan, you're hurt.

Really?

I feel fi.


[Jane gags]

Are you okay Jane?

What is this? What's happening?

You're being purified.

This is just the final step.

No. No!

I stopped the ritual.

This isn't supposed to happen.
There's been a mistake.


[Jane breathes unsteadily]

Dad?

I've missed you so much.

DAD: -Me too.

There's so much I
need to tell you.

You'll get your chance,

but right now, we're together.

I'm so proud of the way you
stood up to your mother.

That's something I
could never... never do.

But, I'm still being purified.

I couldn't stop her.

That's fine.

You still have your
whole life ahead of you.

No one could've expected what
you and your friends did tonight.

You were watching me?

Of course.

You should probably
back up a little.

You know?

Right now.

You're in the splash zone.


[Blood splatters]

[Emotional music ends]

[Continuous monster bass begins]

Wait. No, no, no. No, no, no.

You're not dead.

You can't be here.

[Monster bass continues]

Stay here!

[Monster bass ends]

[Emotional music resumes]

[Phone dials]

OPERATOR (over phone): 91-1,
what is your emergency?

I was kidnapped and almost
sacrificed by a Satanist.

Please send cops to
two-thirty-two California Street.

This is not a joke!

[Monster bass returns]

OPERATOR: - Try to stay calm.

Is the Satanist in
the house with you?

No, we have her.


[Katie gasps]

[Monster bass continues]

[Monster bass ends]

[Emotional music returns]

Thank you.

[Body thuds]


[Monster bass returns]

[Door slams]

[Monster bass ends]

[Emotional music resumes]

I'm so sorry for
everything that my mom did.

I didn't think she was
capable of any of that.

Yeah, me neither.

What do you think you're gonna do
when you get back to your life?

Honestly, I have no idea.

Got any tips?

Well for starters, don't become friends
with someone whose mom worships the devil.

Yeah,

that's probably a good idea.

Hey, can you do me one favor?

Yes, of course.

Can you check in on my mom and dad
after this and make sure they're okay?

Goodbye Jane.

Bye Katie.


[Blood splatters]

[Emotional music continues]

[Police sirens approach]

[Ms. Booker weeps]

[Sirens continue to approach]

[Music ends]

[Natural ambience]

You know, I assumed that my girlfriend would be
one of the first people to show up to my grave.

But I guess I was wrong,

'cause, you didn't even care
enough to show up to my funeral.

I'm sorry, I can't.

Can't what?

Can't bear to face
my grieving family?

Can't face the consequences of
your actions, like an adult?

BRYAN: I died for you.

And while I wasn't exactly
expecting daily visits,

I still can't believe
you abandoned me.

I'm sorry.

That's not enough anymore.

This is what you get!

This is what you deserve!

[Hands tighten grip]

[Soft footsteps]

[Door opens loudly]

[Light switch clicks]

[Footsteps approach]

You couldn't sleep either?

Nah I was sleeping fine,

but you woke me up
when you left my room.

Sorry.

No, it's fine.

Did you have another bad dream?

Yeah.

I wish I had bad dreams.

Why?

Because that's fucking normal after
everything we've been through.

I'm sorry. It's just.

I feel like I can't grieve
like everyone else, you know?

It just doesn't work
like that for me.

Like, I still feel like shit,

but then I'll go home and have
a perfectly nice night of sleep.

It's just, I feel like I
should be more distraught.

Well, it's different for you.

How?

Because, it wasn't your fault.

If I had just
listened to my mom,

Katie would've been
the only one that died.

All my fighting did
was cause more death.

You can't think
about it like that.

They knew it was
going to be dangerous,

but they weren't just going
to sit back and let Katie die.

Because of them,

tomorrow, your mom is going to prison and
you're going to be free of her, forever.

They didn't need to
die for that to happen.

I know.

[Knock. Knock. Knock.]

[Car pulls away]

[Action theme fades in]

[Phone rings]

[Voice on phone is inaudible]

Yeah, this is me.

Yeah, I think I just did.

Okay, okay. I will.

[Jane hangs up]

[Door locks]

[Music intensifies]

[Monster bass blares]

James. James!

What?

She escaped.

[Continuous monster bass begins]

[Monster bass ends]
