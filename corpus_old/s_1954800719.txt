Hi, thanks for watching.

Me and my friends worked really hard
on this movie all summer.

I wanna thank them
for doing such a great job.

Now, I'm proud to present:

The Search For The Shadoweyes Bandit

They call me a dreamer.

Nobody at the policing
takes me seriously anymore.

I know they laugh behind my back.

The only thing
that keeps me going

is my dream of revenging
the death of my partner.

Honey, I think you've had enough.

I'll tell you when I've had enough!

When are you gonna get over this,
he died years ago.

He wasn't just my partner,

he was my best friend.

And I see it every time I close my eyes.
Close my eyes.

I found a clue that will lead us
directly to The Shadoweyes Bandit.

A clue, what is it?

It's...

Zach.

Zach!

Nooo!

I know it's hard,

I just hate
to see you like this.

I love you.

Zach, would want you
to move on.

The only way for me to move on
is to kill Shadoweyes!

You're a big dreamer,
Timmy!

I love that about you,
but catching Shadoweyes...

it's just not realistic.

Maybe you're right.

That's why I want
more shots of alcohol.

Look,
I know I can't replace Zach,

but like it or not
I'm your partner now.

And we are traffic cops.

You know maybe in five,
ten years,

you'll make it to detective, then you
can go after a guy like Shadoweyes.

Till then it's a pipe dream.

Everyone in this damn town
is telling me the same thing,

that I'll never catch him.

In your dreams kid.

DÃ©jÃ  vu all over again.

My wife,

my partner,

my Captain.

I do not wanna hear
another word about Shadoweyes!

Is that understood?!

This is an FBI investigation.

So if this pipe dream
of catching Shadoweyes

continues to interfere with your
real job which is writing tickets

then you might as well
turn in your badge, right now!

Is that understood?!

Yes sir!

Stop the car!
What?

Just stop the car!

You, stop right there!

Argh.
I'm sorry.

Have you seen a man in a black jacket
run through here? - No.

Veronica?

What are you doing in here?

I've just been here drinking alcohol.

All by myself.

I've just been so lonely
after Zach died.

I know.

But don't worry,

I'll find his killer.

I hope so,

but that won't bring him back.

I've just been so...

lonely.

What're you doing? - Are you
saying you never considered it?

Your husband was my best friend.

And I'm a married man!

You married to a girl,
you can have a woman tonight.

I will never
talk about my wife like that.

Help me.

Who are you talking to?

Who are you talking to!

You're setting me up?

It was you...

you set up Zach.

Argh.

Bill, do you copy?!

They are all on my tail!

I requested backup,
what's your 20?

South of Main street!

Ok, be careful!
Shadoweyes has thugs everywhere.

Taste that.

Was that good?

Now I hear,
you're looking for my boss.

Be careful what you look for,
you might just find him.

But let me
tell you something else cop:

I hate...

cops!

Watch you chirping, birdy.

Let's discover it.

Argh. Argh.

D'oh!

Do you want more?
Argh.

Here you crook!

Argh.

Argh.

Bill, come in.

Bill, do you copy?

Sorry, Bill,
is unavailable right now.

He is a little tide up.

Who is this?

Hey, is this somebody
we should worry about?

No.
He's a traffic cop.

I can't tell you
my real name,

but my friends call me
The Shadoweyes Bandit.

You'll never get away
with this, Shadoweyes!

Oh yes I will get away with it,

just like I got away with
murdering your last partner.

You scumbag!

I won't rest till you are
behind bars!

This is my town!

Do you hear me?!

And if you ever talk to me like that
again kid, you're dead!

I kill your wife,
I kill your friends wife,

I kill your neighbour,
I kill your neighbour's dog!

This is my town!

This is my town!

You better just give up this
hero cop fantasy, kid.

What the hell!

He's behind you!
Yeah.

Argh.
He is over there!

Hey.

Hey kid, hey kid, listen, listen.
I was, I was just kidding.

I was kidding.
Listen, listen.

We, we can do business
you and I. Yah.

I can make you a very good trade.

What do you want?
To lock you up.

You have a right to remain silent.

Anything you do or say,
can be used against you.

You can't do this,
I have powerful friends.

They will come and kill you.
I know Constantinople, Istanbul.

Shaddup it!

Your time is over Shadoweyes.

Get used to a life in prison.

By the way, a nice hat.

What you do in here?

I've just been sitting here
drinking alcohol.

All by myself.
I've just been so...

lonely.

What're you doing? - Are you
saying you never considered it?

Your husband was my best friend.

And I'm a married man!

Bill, do you copy?!

They are all on my tail!

Argh!

Argh.

Argh.

How that tastes?

I heard
you're looking for my boss.

Be careful what you look for,
you might just find him.

Quit your chirping,

birdy.

The End
