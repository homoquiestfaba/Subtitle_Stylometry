[Audience cheering]

And right now...
Right now...

Right now it's time to...

Kick out the jams,
motherfucker!

<i>[Mc5's kick out the jams]</i>

Yeah

I- I-I I'm gonna

I'm gonna kick out-

[record scrapes, music stops]

[Music,
high-pitching whining]

Dude, come on, man.

Take this horrible shit off.

What the hell?
I'm listening to that.

If mom comes home,
she'll make me shut it off.

All right, well,
I'm doing her a favor then.

[High pitched whining,
screaming resumes]

Dude, you know what?

This is really, like,
making me crazy.

Then leave.

WhatI just got here.

What are you doing, by the way?

I'm starting a magazine.

<i>Like... like "nineteen"
instead of sixteen?</i>

Or "twenty-one"

Or, no, no, no, wait.

<i>We should totally
go younger- thirteen.</i>

Get in on the newbie chicks.

No. It's a magazine
for fuck-up kids.

Like kids who have parties

when their parents are away
and destroy the house.

Cool! I could be, like,
the editor or something.

No. I'm the editor
and the illustrator.

Well, what does that leave me?

You're just a punk.

Guess I am just a punk.

"Punk."
That's a great title.

Yeah. That was my idea, dude.
I thought of that idea.

What?
No, you didn't.

I just said,
"that's a great title."

Who gave you the idea
for "punk"

Who said it was a great title?

<i>[Talking heads'
life during wartime]</i>

Heard of a van

it's loaded with weapons

packed up and ready to go

Heard of some grave sites

out by the highway

a place where nobody knows

The sound of gunfire

off in the distance

I'm getting used to it now

Lived in a brownstone

lived in a ghetto

I've lived
all over this town

This ain't no party

this ain't no disco

this ain't
no fooling around

This ain't no mudd club

or CBGB

I ain't got time
for that now

Heard about Houston

heard about Detroit...

[Music box playing]


Ow!

[Rock music]

[Cow moos]

[Woman screams]

Hillel, where are you?

Hillel?!
Hilly!

Kidnapped?

Bertha, no one kidnaps
from the poor.

What?
Hilly's missing.

Get your truck.

Go, go, go! Run!

[Brakes squeal]

How did he get here?

He must've walked?

Three Miles?

It's two and a half.

That's not normal.


You currently reside
at 21 east 2nd street?

And what is your
marital status, Mr. Kristal?

My wife and I are split.

Separated or divorced?

Divorced. Yep.

Children?

Two.

And this is your... second
failed attempt to run a bar.

A club.

Divorced and two bankruptcies.

Perhaps you should
try something else.

I'm sick of the parties

I'm sick of the ravers

I'm sick of the dogs
and my noisy neighbors

I'm sick of the subways
and I'm sick of the crowds

I'm sick of hot water
always running out

I'm sick of the crap
I gotta take in this town

If I didn't love it

I swear I'd burn it
to the ground

I'm sick of the tourists

I'm sick of their stares

I'm sick of all the girls

who ain't showin'
their wares

I'm sick of the queens
and I'm sick of the whores

I'm sick of bad lovin'
and those raconteurs

I'm sick of the crap
I gotta take in this town

I'm sick

if I didn't love it

I swear I'd burn it
to the ground

You know I'm sick

if I didn't love it

I swear I'd burn it
to the ground

I'm sick of the crap
I gotta take in this town

I'm really sick

you play?

Used to.

Me too.

Mother required it.

Hilly Kristal.

They call me Idaho.

Why's that?

I like potatoes.


Buy you a drink?

The palace bar.

I like the irony.

What'll you have?

Whiskey.

Brandy and Fresca.

No Fresca.

Soda.

Anyone play music in here?

No.

Nobody'd complain about
the noise this far downtown.

They'd complain,
but no one would listen.

Think what a coat of paint
could do.

Or a bulldozer.

I wanna buy this bar.

Got any money?

<i>[The velvet underground's
heroin]</i>

[Clock ticking]

Look around, hillel.

You know that I'm not
made of money.

This rugelach looks
amazing, Mrs. Kristal.

Oh, you're such
a good boy, Merv.

Take some more.

Merv, are you gonna
be working with, uh, hillel

on the new club?

Only if he pays me.

He'll pay you.

Am I correct, hillel?

All the boys,
they're putting me down...

I know what they say
when I ain't around

He can't make it...

Can't play
with broken strings, Idaho.

Thanks, hilly.

Hilly's on the bowery.

Very nice.

Another promising investment
opportunity for your mother.

This way to the kitchen.

And lose
that phony accent, Merv.

Two more blasts of ketchup.

How many is that so far?

Uh, fifteen.

It's a trainwreck.

What a surprise.
Nice to see you too.

I'm dropping out of school, dad.
Well, you shouldn't.

Well, I can't afford it.

So that's my fault?
Yeah.

Look, I need a place to crash.

Just for a couple of nights

until I get things
back on track.

You leave that boyfriend yet?

You consider
getting a real job yet?

[Rock music]

Well, it's a start.

We have a stage.

Now we need an income.

I was thinking 50 cent beers
and topless waitresses

like that joint down on...

Look, the music'll
do it all for us.

You start playing
that disco shit, I'm gone.

Country and blues.

In New York City?

This club's gonna be different.

Country and blues.

Country, bluegrass, blues.

I shoulda never
left my other job.

The place was a shit hole.

This place is a shit hole.

Idaho, come on.

I'm locking up.

It's the only bar in the city
with Fresca on tap.

Yeah, but that shit'll kill ya.

[Rock music]

Uh, hello!

We hear you have a stage.

We have a band.

The perfect band
to perform on your stage.

What kind of music do you play?

Uh, new music.

Uh, what does "CBGB" stand for?

Country, bluegrass, blues.

They play a little of that.

A little rock,
a little country,

a little bluegrass,
a little blues.

Hey, didn't you used to manage
the village vanguard?

Hundred years ago.

One moment.

Get a load of him.

[Country music playing]

Terry Ork.
I manage the band television.

Oh.

Uh, you just met the guitar
players, Richard and tom, outside.

It's a win-win.

CBGB gets new customers
buying drinks

and we get to play
for an audience.

They any good?

They are... raw, man!

They're primitive.

They are going to be huge.

I bet they stink.

But maybe if they perform...

They'll get better.

All right.

You've got some vision, man.

Only original music.

You got it.

Ah, that way you get
to avoid paying ASCAP fees.

It's a philosophy.

You might wanna consider
an exterminator.

Just...

You got a good sound engineer?

You're talking to a man
who sang at radio city.

<i>[The stooges' 1969]</i>

Oh my and a-a boo hoo

hilly Kristal.

My hands are dirty, okay?

What's your name?

Taxi.

I'm not much of a dog person.

But you're mechanical.

You musical?

Yeah, I played in a band once.

My guitar was stolen.

I have a position at my club.

Are you paying?

Yes.

Oh my and a-a boo hoo

hey, what-
how do I-

Shit.

This is taxi.

My sound engineer.

Hey, man.

You're gonna wanna crank it.

You play too loud,
I'm walking out.

Hey, whenever you're ready!

You know I I jump outta bed

I pull down the shade

I used to have
such sweet dreams

Now it's more
like an air raid

I see the opposition clear

I see them glare

I don't care

it doesn't matter to me

I don't care

I never think about it

I don't care

slip out of myself
like a shadow

Second verse is a lot better.

And somersault
through walls

I can't tell,
it's really so odd

Is it spring or fall?

I thought it was good.

Not very country.

Going to have
to change that name.

False advertising.

What do you think?

"I don't care.

"It doesn't matter to me.

"I don't care.

"I never think about it.

I don't care."

There's something there.

I can see it.
There is something there.

[Stomach gurgling]

Jonathan,
your stomach's growling.

Do you wanna go get a bagel?

Lisa,
you want something to eat?

No.

I ate your chili last night.

So...

If you're not going to school,

are you getting a job?

It's 7:30 in the morning.

You gotta have some plan.
What is it?

To not be here
when you get back.

Ugh. Shit!

[Richard hell and the Voidoids'
blank generation]

I was saying
let me out of here

Before I was even born

it's such a gamble
when you get a face

It's fascinating to observe
what the mirror does

But when I dine it's for
the wall that I set a place

I belong to
the blank generation and

I can take it
or leave it each time

'Scuse me.
I have to open up.

He's dead.

I've been watchin' him
for you, hilly.

Has anybody
informed the police?

Nah.
Cops don't care too much

about dead guys in the bowery.

Where'd he come from?

Upstairs.

[Telephone ringing]


Hey, answer the phone already!

There's a dead body outside.

You wanna come see
if it's one of your guests?

Not particularly.

Had a guy stabbed
in the shower here last month.

Big mess. Had to call
the cops three times.

Pain in my ass.

What?
You want a room?

What's going on, Stan?

I'm arresting this man
under suspicion of murder.

Whose suspicion?

Look, Kristal.
Let me do my job, okay?

What about the body?

Welcome to CBGB, gentlemen.

Compliments of the house.

And who the hell are you?

Hilly Kristal.

Police took a guy
for murder today.

Yeah, we heard.

He didn't do it.

Plays the violin.

We call him Idaho.

Yeah, he's a little guy.

Yeah.
He's that junkie.

I'd like to help him,

but I need

some guidance on that.

What do we get out of it?

I'm your neighbor.

Got lots of neighbors.

You treat me right,

I'll treat you right.

I'll make a call.

Merv!

Another round of beers
for our neighbors here.

Hey, hilly.

Hello, Idaho.

I'm sorry about this.


At least they got heat.

<i>[The velvet underground's
I can't stand it]</i>

Why'd you come?

'Cause you needed me to.

You read much?

I'm a junkie, hilly.

Do I look like I read
fucking books to you?

<i>"Small is beautiful:</i>

<i>A study of economics
as if people mattered."</i>

Just came out.

Talks about how economics

has become the dominant
ideological force in society.

How we need
to re-think that.

With art. Music.

You're out of gas.

It's only a few more blocks.

He's got vodka?

I can't stand it
anymore-more

I can't stand it
anymore-ore

I can't stand it
anymore-more

[Engine starts]

I remember

ooh how
the darkness doubled

I recall

lightning struck itself

I was listening

listening to the rain

oh, shit.

That's not good.

Damn shower.

This place is...
Cool, man.

I told you not to...

Hey! Hey! 2.50!

Aw, Jesus!

Hey!
You're blocking the drain!

Good working with you.

Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow?

Yes.

Seven dollarsHow am I
supposed to live on this?

Hey, man. Art sucks.

Not a bad night.

Nearly electrocuted a guy.

Doubled the attendance.

[Rock music]

"OMFUG?"

Other music for uplifting...

Gormandizers.

Oh, yeah.
Well, that explains it.

Your mother called.

She wants to know when
you're paying her back.

Did you tell her
we need a little time?

I did.

And that things are picking up.

So what's the problem?
I lied.

I am working on some other

financial opportunities.

Excellent.

Watch it!

You book any country yet?

Closest I got was
some guy named Wayne county

who's thinking of
becoming a jayne county.

I was hearing "country,"
he was saying "county."

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Good day.

Thank you.


W- w-w-wait.

I gotta pee.

Hold it!
I can't!

You are not going!

I'll be back.

Aah!

Maybe it was a mistake to hire
a junkie as the third hand.

Hurry up!

Excellent.

So much for the lucrative
world of piano delivery.

See?
I was quick!

Uh-oh.

<i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>

<i>I've earned everything

Right there.
No way, man.


If you guys weren't neighbors,

I'd put that chair
on your bill, Bert.

Bert fuck you, hilly.

This table, it tilts.

They shorted us
on the hard liquor order.

If we don't pay the bill,
they'll cut us off.

Lisa.
Hi.

You leaving
that rotten boyfriend

and going back to school?

No.

If it's money
you came for-

you seen this?

No.

"The great thing about
this band, television,

"is that they have
absolutely no musical

"or socially redeeming
characteristics

and they know it."

Who wrote that?
Josh Feigenbaum.

Who's he?
He's important.

So people are gonna read this

and they're gonna
start talking.

And bands are gonna start
showing up wanting to play here.

And all bands have fans,
even the shitty ones.

And everybody wants
to be in a band and have fans,

so new bands are gonna
start up and show up.

You have no idea
what's about to happen here.

So...

Gimme a job.

The pay sucks.

The music sucks.

But far be it from me

to refute the words
of Josh Feigenbaum.

What do you expect
to do around here?

Well, what do you do
around here?

Do you want a job,
or do you want to fight?

I asked you for a job.

Fine.

Okay.

To start with,

bands will sound-check
from 4:00 to 6:00.

Yeah.

I'll post the lineup
at 7:30.

And bands don't get
to decide the order.

They fight, they're out.
Got it.

Anything else?

Yeah. Bikers don't pay
for their drinks.

When?
A lot.

Ever.
Why not?

Policy.

CBGB.

<i>Collection services.
Hilly Kristal?</i>

Hold on.
Bill collectors.

You're hired.

Clean up on aisle 10.

Oh, he is not
talking to me, is he?

Yes. He is.

Uh, fourteen.

Thirteen.


Eleven.

Twelve.

Idaho. Hey.
Where's the beer?

There's no beer.
What do you mean?

Hilly didn't pay the bill.

Same reason there's no phone.

We don't need a phone.
We have a payphone.

We're a bar.
We need beer!

Jesus Christ.
Look at this!

Will you-Look at
the size of that rat.

Don't point at him.
Why?

It upsets him.
Who?

Bert.

Bert.
Bert the rat?

We have a deal.

What are you talking about?

He doesn't bite me
if I feed him.

Hilly spent a fortune on
exterminating cockroaches

and you're feeding
the fucking rats?

Shh!

He's listening.

You're gonna make him mad!

How's the chili?
Bert likes it.

If Bert doesn't eat it,

I know can't feed it
to anybody else.

Well, as long as Bert likes it.

Get rid of Bert.
Right now.

And find some beer.

I like Lisa.

I like Lisa a lot.

Hey! Here you go.
Television.

Check 'em out.
Right around the corner.

Here you go.
Television.

CBGB's.

term underground rock.

"Underground"
implies secretive.

There's something
precious about that to me.

Punk, on the other hand,
it's in your face.

It's sarcastic,
ironic, cutting.

So you're a punk.

Yeah.
I am too.

I'm an illustrator,
and I'm starting a magazine.

<i>Yeah, it's called punk.</i>

And your punk magazine

is going to hold forth
the losers as winners.

Deify the freaks and outcasts
of the underground-

I mean downtown music scene.

Yes.

Thou shalt keep no gods,

especially fossils like
Eric Clapton and zeppelin.

You wanna write
for the magazine?

What's a degree
from Oxford for anyway?

To impress
your parents' friends.

I'm John.
Mary.

Hey.

Hi, Eddie.
Nice to meet ya.

Until 4:00.</i>

<i>In the morning?

CBGB.

<i>Hey, you got that
TV set band on tonight?</i>

Yes. Television.

David bowie
says that television

is the most original band
in New York.

[Telephone rings]

CBGB.

If that's what you want,

I can take care of it for you.

Coming to you from
the bowery of New York City...

Television!

I always thought a punk

was someone
who took it up the ass.

They said they met
at art school.

Looks like
they sniffed some fumes

from all that paint and glue.

Tell 'em to wait.
Okay. Why?

I'm going to see if I can
increase the size of the house.

Chief!

Just a minute.

We're gonna see if we
can get more people to...

Come in and listen to you.

Okay?

Stan, I'd like
to invite you into the club

to hear a band
I think you will appreciate.

I'm working here, Kristal.

How about if I buy you a beer?

Look at that!
Off duty.

Two beers.

The name of this band
is talking heads.

We live across the street.

I can't seem to face
up to the facts

I'm tense and nervous
and I can't relax

I can't sleep

It's called a cover charge.

Could I get through?
Let me in.

Let me in. Let me in.

I'm Nicky Gant.
I produce records.

You want me in your club.


Nice.

I hate the bowery.

Because the night
belongs to lovers

Because the night
belongs to lust

Because the night
belongs to lovers

Because the night
belongs to us

Have my doubts
when I'm alone

Love is the ring,
a telephone

Love is an angel
disguised as lust

Hey, Iggy.

Hey, Ork.

Let's go downstairs.
I'll give you head.

Why don't you just
lick my stomach?

Everybody wants
to suck my cock.

All right.

They can't touch you now

can't touch you now

can't touch you now

because the night
belongs to lovers

In you go.

Dad, is there or isn't
there a cover charge?

Someone's gotta pay.

Hey, John. John.

Isn't that the guy that made
that awful feedback album?

John, it's Lou Reed.

That's Lou Reed.

Oh, shit it's-
that's Lou Reed.

We have to interview him.
Yeah.

Hi, Lou.

Um, we would like
to interview you

<i>for the first issue
of Pun magazine.</i>

We'd like to put you
on the cover.

Cover of the first issue.

If you agree
to do an interview.

Your circulation
must be enormous.

Do you like Patti Smith?

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

What about Bruce Springsteen?

Oh, I love him.

Y- you do?

Oh, yeah.
He's one of us.

Thank you.

He's a shit.

What are you talking about?

What kind of stupid
question is that?

Okay- do I ask you
what you like?

Who gives a fuck what I like?

I don't even
give a fuck what I like.

Well, you're a rock star, man.

Oh, yeah.
I keep forgetting.

Sontag called it the sensibility
of failed seriousness.

What's their name?

The Ramones.

Look like they were raised
under police lamps.

guys have for me?

We got four songs:

<i>I don't wanna
walk around with you,</i>

<i>I don't wanna be learned,</i>

<i>I don't wanna be tamed,</i>

<i>and I don't wanna go
down to the basement.</i>

Lot of things
you don't wanna do.

Yeah.

Anything you wanna do?

We're working on something now.

Something positive?

<i>Yeah. It's-it's called
I wanna sniff some glue.</i>

Good to have a point of view.

One, two, three, four!

[Dischordant music]

What the fuck are you playing?

Ah, fuck!

You guys wanna try it again?
Yeah.

Is Johnny coming back?
[Glass breaks]

What are we playing?
Johnny!

Johnny?


Lively!

One, two, three, four!

Sittin' in a hospital bed

I- I want life

I want my life

I want my life

I got knocked down,
but I'll get up

Nobody is gonna like you guys.

But I'll have you back.

The city's going bankrupt.

It's like a disease.

Which I would prefer
not to catch.

Meaning?

We have to get
our affairs in order.

I'm working on it.

Your working
isn't working, hilly.


from the bowery
of New York City,

Wayne county.

Hello, sex kittens!

Eat my pussy!

Wish I had one.
Oh!

[Cheers, whistling]

Here we go!
Here we go.

Ready, ready, ready,
ready, ready!

One, two, three, I'Chaim!

Wanted nothing more

I know you wouldn't go...

No, no, no, no, no!

C'mere.

I'm Nicky Gant!

Nicky fuckin' Gant!

I produce records!

Hilly told me
this was on the house!

No money.

We cool?

You were a marksman

told me that law,
like wine, is ageless

You got any-any chips
or something?

Gonna have to do something
about that stage.

Well, you might want
to think about having fewer

"guests of hilly"
and more paying customers

if you want to pay for it.

I'm with Lisa on this one.

You gotta spend money
to make money.

You gotta have money
to spend money to make money.

And since you spend
all the money you make,

you don't have
any money to spend.

So you might want to think

about saving the money you make

instead of spending
the money you make!

All right. We're gonna
try that one again.

[Audience cheering]

What are you doing?

Damn it, dad.

What, two bankruptcies
wasn't enough for you?

Why not go for three?
Stop.

No, I'm taking over
the finances.

No, you're not.
You're fired.

You're firing me?

Yeah.
Get the hell out.

I want my life

I want my life

things are not
gonna work out with her.

Everything all right, hilly?


who were the people you,
you know, idolized as an artist?

Fuck, you know, I always
really liked Brigitte Bardot.

Uh-huh.

I thought she was sort of a
continental punk, you knowYeah.

I always thought sex
was a cool thing to sell.

A sure thing.

I wish I'd invented sex.

You like sex?

God, look at this!

I'm sick of the goddamn fleas
from hilly's dog.

Have you considered boots?

Boots?

Can I describe
what it's like

To have sex
with the light on?

And would you feel right

if I did you tonight
and put the bite on?

All this and more
little girl

How 'bout on the floor
little girl?

Time to implore you girl

I'm just a dead boy

you know that
I'm just a dead boy

I wanna be a dead boy

I'll die for you

That tell me the degrees
I been loved on

Ya got dents in your head

That tell me all the beds

How 'bout on the floor
little girl?

No time to implore you girl

I'm just a dead boy

you know that
I'm just a dead boy

I wanna be a dead boy

I'll die for you
if you want me to

Look out!

Don't tell me.
"There's something there."

There is definitely
something there.

The dead boys.

As long as they don't
take their name too seriously.

Hilly Kristal.

Cheetah chrome.

That was good.
It was really good.

Thank you, sir.
That means a lot, you know?

Your dog is crapping
on the floor, sir.

Yeah, he does that.

I piss in ice machines.

Where you guys from?

Cleveland, sir.

Well, I'm impressed
with the youth of Cleveland.

Oh, you shouldn't be.
Why not?

Lotta losers.

Well, you seem awfully polite.

Yeah, well, we were altar boys.

That was a while ago.

Look, Mr. Kristal,
do we get the gig here or not?

Yeah.
No shit!

Holy fuck.

Spoken like a true altar boy.

a message of violence.

I mean, what we're doing is not
really destructive, you know?

So it's not a statement
of aggression?

We're just letting out
a little energy and frustration.

And where better to do that?

Here or on the streets?

Good point.
Hi, mom!

Uh, yeah.

It's actually really healthy.

So what kind of girls
do you like?

All kinds.

I like the ones that like to
fuck and leave in the morning.

Stiv, she just wants
to give you a blowjob.

Cut.

I dare you.

You know better
than to dare me.

Hot flashes
burning my brain

Your tongue lashes
drive me insane

From New York City to LA

You're known
as the hottest lay

And ya pink canopy
gonna shackle ya down

You crossed
every back in town

From a cherry runaway
to a bowery queen

Used up before
your sweet sixteen

Everyone knows
you were caught

With the meat in your mouth

Said everyone knows

you been caught with
the meat in your mouth

Whoo!

Look for love
on a one-way street

Bedding down with every-

a- stripping and a-dancing
and a-buying some downs

See?
It's not all about violence!

Cut! Cut!

Yeah, stiv!

Gettin' his dick sucked.
Oh, shit.

Fresca.

On the house.

Stan.

You know I got nothing
against you, right?

I like to think anyone

who shares a drink in my club
is my friend.

Well, as your friend,

we've had some complaints.

About what?

Hey, hilly.

Uh, excuse me.

Now, I'm just
the messenger here, all right?

But I understand the complaints

are about the...

Element your club attracts.

Are you kidding me?

If anything,
I'm cleaning the street up.

I am just the messenger here.

I mean,
people bigger than you and I

are tugging the strings
and stirring the shit.

And I also understand

that you're three months
behind on your rent.

Now that kind of thing
just doesn't help.

Pay your bills, Kristal.

Pay your fuckin' bills.

I don't like that guy.

I got a spirit in my house

and I know
it ain't no...

I know you got more junk, man.

Come on.
Give me the fuckin' drug.

Come on, Idaho.
Give me the fuckin' drug.

Not in... my club!

Be cool, man.

Like I was saying
previously, Stan,

these two gentlemen

were not abiding by
the rigorous code of ethics

I strive to maintain
in my establishment.

Well, that's not very
good, now, is it, boys?

In my house, in my house

What are we stopping for?

Joey fell off the stage, John.

Fuckin' think
I didn't fuckin' notice?!

Ah, fuck!

I know a girl
from a lonely street

Cold as ice cream
but still as sweet

Dry your eyes Sunday girl

Hey I saw your guy

with a different girl

looks like he's
in another world

Run and hide Sunday girl

[feedback whines]

Hey, all you wannabes,
I'm fuckin' Iggy pop!

Let's play
some real fuckin' music!

"I wanna be your dog."
Fuck you, Iggy!

One, two, three, four!

So messed up

I want you here

in my room

I want you here

now we're gonna be

face to face

and I'll lay right down

in my favorite place

now I wanna

be your dog

now I wanna

be your dog

now I wanna

be your dog

fuck the bogus claims.

I'm the pioneer of punk.

Stage dive.
I was the first.

See the bands are not political,
but their disavowing of politics

in and of itself,
it is political.

I belong to the blank
generation.

And relevant!
And timely!

John, hilly is a modern-day
salonist!

Like a drug I never did before.

Ooh, no no no, I like that!

It's true, uh, yeah,

modern-day
mabel dodge, right?

Gertrude Stein!
Yeah! Yeah!

Picasso painted gertrude Stein

sitting in her chair
in her salon of old.

You should draw hilly

sitting on his couch at CB's.

The grand curator of punk!

Mother always said,

"you have to listen
to hear."

50 cents, please.

Thank you, Annie.

You're up first
tomorrow, Annie.

Shirts, then Ramones,

then dictators.

You scare them.

Yeah, probably.

This place is starting
to happen.

It's still shit-ass music,

you ask me.

It's not the Grand Ole Opry.

It's hard to get Conway Twitty
down to the bowery.

One day.

Maybe me and the boys'll
hang back till then.

Stop scaring the kids.

Let you grow
this place into a, uh,

something.

Then when you're famous,
and old Twitty shows up,

I'll be back and I'm
bringing all my friends.

Admission on the house.

Don't forget, we're
right down the block.

Thanks, Leslie.

Nobody calls me that.

Except my grandma.

All right, boys,
let's get the hell out

of this punk-ass
excuse for a bar.

You want a re-match,
you know where to find me.

Oh...

One more thing.

Clean those fucking toilets.

They just- you can't-

it's the sm-

they're disgusting.

Cool.

Fuckin' cool.

Fuckin' fuckin' cool.

Hilly!

Sire records.

This is the contract.

Congratulations.

You pissed?

I'd be fucking pissed.

You're always fucking pissed.

Are you kidding me?
I'm proud of you guys.

Can't believe we got signed.

We suck.

Now you gotta make
a good record.

You think we're gonna
be rock stars?

You already are.

All by myself

all by myself

all by myself

like everybody else

Happy Birthday.

You're not gonna sing?

If you wanna apologize,
I accept.

If not, then shut up.

Yes, ma'am.

[Phone rings]

CBGB.

<i>...what time we're
going on tonight.</i>

Zeke wants to know what time
they're going on tonight.

I don't know yet.

Bastard won't tell me.

Yep, see you tonight.

This is good for you.

"The Ramones are
the apotheosis of punk."

Frank rose again.

"They are an acknowledgement
of the failure of glitter."

That they are.

"Brevity is the soul of wit,

"and it is right at the heart
of the Ramones' music.

They cannot be accused
of dragging out a number."

You just gotta hope they
don't kill each other.

Call Leslie.

Number is on the wall.

Hilly Kristal?

My understanding is that
there is a, uh,

problem with the rent.

And when the rent doesn't get
paid, it comes to me to collect.

But, you see,
I'm forced to double it

to cover my overhead.

So now we have
a compounded problem...

<i>How many are there?
Three.</i>

<i>They packin'
Yeah.</i>

The rent check's on its way,

but I'll just...

Need to think about
the doubling part.

There's nothing
to think about, Mr. Kristal.

You guys thirsty?
Cut the shit!

You have a strong
business that operates

to full capacity
almost every night.

So let me explain
something to you.

I'm not a very patient man.

So I suggest you give me
what I came here for.

How you been, Leslie?

I haven't been feeling so good.

Think I got a tapeworm.

Quit calling me that.

Do you guys know who
you're dealing with?

Get in the fucking car!

Go, let's go!
Scooch over.

What was that?!
A shakedown.

New York style.

I don't understand.

You paid the rent, right?

Everything all right?

Why wouldn't it be?

I wrote a rent check last week.

So it was a misunderstanding?

Well, I didn't send it.

What?!

Why not?!
I forgot.

Dad!
What?

I am taking over the books
whether you like it or not!

Because if I don't,
someone is going

to come here and kill you!

Okay.
Okay?

Yeah.

Okay.

Hello there!

Kristal, this your truck?

You know it is.

I'm gonna have to write you up.

Why?
Did you read the sign?

You and I both know

how long this truck
has been parked here

in this exact spot

without getting a ticket.

Well, New York
is going bankrupt.

There's pressure
to bring in some revenue.

Well,

this car has been here all day.

Move the truck.

City's cracking down.

You're not telling me
the whole story.

What's that supposed to mean?

Where does the cash go
at the end of the night?

After I count it?

Stop it.
What?

What happens to the cash
at the end of the night?

I put it in the freezer.

What?

In my apartment.
You got an apartment?

I can't sleep on a mattress

when bands are getting
signed right and left.

'Kay, I'm going to go
through all this paper.

And then we will know
where we're at.

Terrific.
You go to the freezer

in your apartment
and get the money now.

Pay the rent, now,

and take the rest
to the bank, now.

I don't know how this is
going to work out with you

ordering me around.

I don't know how it's
gonna work out if I don't.

[Rock music]

Hilly!

Damn it, hilly!

Ah, shit!
Goddamn it!

Turn the water off!

There's water everywhere, man!

Jesus Christ!
Okay.

You know, Bert,
I've been thinking

I should start managing
some of those bands.

And Jonathan shit
in the front room here!

The dead boys.
Talking heads.

The shirts.

Punk isn't about decay,

it's about the apocalypse.
It's about annihilation.

Nothing works, so let's
skip right to armageddon.

If the world is ending,

you might as well
do away with pretense

and say what you think.

Uncensored sex!

And drugs!

And violence!

Just everything.

Decadent sounds
great right now,

compared to what's
happening in the real world.

Yeah!

I don't need anyone

don't need no mom and dad

Come on, Genya,
they're charming!

Hilly, they're punk,
and they're charming?

I got some news for you

I want you to produce them,
I think they're special.

I got my devil machine

got my electronic dream

sonic reducer,
ain't no loser

Sonic reducer,
ain't no loser

I've been waiting
for you in the office!

In a minute, Lisa.

People out on the streets

they don't know who I am

I watch them from my room

Mrs. Kristal!

Oh, Merv!

So good to see you!

Mother, welcome to CBGB.

Hillel.

Uh, listen, I need a drink.

On the house!

Glenlivet with a twist.

Coming right up.
Okay.

We don't have any glenlivet.

We'll take care of it,
go talk to Lisa.

Come this way, Mrs. Kristal.

I have a special spot
for you right over here.

Excuse me!
Watch your backs!

This is what you're spending.

This is what you're making.

I have to get back out there.

Give her a minute, hilly.

You're spending too much.

You cannot afford
to personally take on a band.

I agree with Lisa on this.

Oh, this is about
the dead boys.

Ye- before we branch out,

we need to get our
primary business in order.

And we need to put proper
vendor agreements in place.

We need to have billing cycles.

Look here, okay?

This is what you're
spending on toilet paper.

I don't believe that.

You're getting it from
the deli, a lot of it!

If you buy it in bulk, you can get
it for a fraction of the price.

This is what you're
spending on beer.

This is what you are bringing in
on the bar in general.

Hey, too many customers
are drinking for free!

This is bullshit.
Hilly, cut it out!

Why are we talking
about toilet paper?!

I have Genya Ravan out there

ready to produce
the dead boys album!

You're wasting my time!

Fine.

Goddamn it, hilly.

This is quite good!

Hilly's chili, huh?

Word is, Stiv Bators

jerks off in that chili.

I've had worse in my mouth.

Everything okay, mother?

Delicious!

What are you doing?

Trying to light a cigarette.

You shouldn't smoke.

That shit'll kill ya.

I don't smoke.

You know, your old man

is really not such a bad guy.

Well, you obviously
don't know him very well.

Oh God, zip, Idaho!
Please!

Excuse me.

Sometimes you hurt

the ones you love the most.

What fortune cookie
did you read that in?

Nah.

I got it from a poster
in the subway

across from this bench
I kinda like.

I prefer rachmaninoff, hillel.

Yeah, I prefer Beethoven
myself.

That punk rock shit
gives me a headache.

No shit.

Mom was right to leave you.

You're an asshole.

Lisa what?

In my capacity as asshole,

I am promoting you to vice
president of business affairs.

Is that supposed to be
some kind of apology?

The dead boys are gonna
change things for me, Lisa.

I am gonna get them
a record deal,

and they are gonna be big!

I'm so sick of TV

you know I'm getting
bored of the tubes

And I'm so sick of romance

I refuse to chase you, Lisa!

I've had it, hilly.

I can't take it anymore!
The fleas and the shit!

Your dog is crapping
everywhere!

It's disgusting,
this is not a kennel!

Either Jonathan goes, or I go!

Taxi, you don't like it,

you don't have to work here!

I don't play my stereo too

Just wanna get out
on the street fights

Just ain't nothin' to do

I get on out of here

find somethin' to do

yeah get on out of here

just ain't nothin' to do

so, is that your
real hair color,

or do you just dye it that way?

Who wants to know?

Me.

It's real.

So, now you know.

Yeah, we're good.

So, they vomit, they drop trow,

they slash themselves,
they bleed,

they hang themselves,
and that's just on stage.

I think their on-stage antics

are evidence of commitment.

Hilly, I don't want to produce

a shit album for
a flash-in-the-pan band.

Fine, I'll find somebody else.

We're gonna need money.
Yep.

And we're gonna need
to take them out on the road.

Yep.

Cheetah doesn't trust me.

Cheetah takes too many drugs.

Sire is interested
in signing you if we

can show the band is reliable

and people will pay to see you.

We are the definition
of reliable.

What'd I miss?

Let's make a demo
and get out on the road.

Hilly, how much money is this?

We are gonna rock and shock.

Don't screw this up.

Scouts honor.

Yeah, I heard she fucked bowie

at... at CB's.

In the bathroom.

Fuck in a bathroom at CB's,
that's not sanitary.

What the fuck is that?

What?

Get rid of those
fucking things.

They're just stickers.

Hilly, your manager- hey!

Hilly, your manager,

the guy who is footing the bill

for all of this, he's Jewish.

Me, your producer, I'm Jewish.

And the guy who
owns this studio,

who is doing us a favor

by letting us record at
these ridiculous prices,

he's got numbers
tattooed on his arm.

Do you know what that means?

Not really.

Auschwitz!

Hitler!
Nazis!

Now get rid of
the fucking swastikas!

Okay, fucking lighten up.

I'll get rid of them.

Look, you guys,
you're not Nazis, okay?

You're punks.

And anything bad,
anything wrong,

you wanna do it.
I get it.

Now let's go have a bagel.

What's a bagel?
What's- what's a bagel?

What part of Cleveland
are you from?

Cleveland, Germany?


Well, call it street music.

Look, all I care about
is originality.

These kids have
something to say.

We really should listen.

We're the dead boys!

I- I don't want you

to hang around

yeah, I don't need you

to drag me down

I- I don't really

wanna dance

hello, Poughkeepsie!

I just wanna
get in your pants

What's up, Cleveland?

Fuck you, new haven!

Fuck off, Boston!

Suck my balls, bridgeport!

You cry and cry

you know I'll
prick you in the end

Ya look at me
that way, bitch

Your face is gonna
get a punch

Hello, white plains!

We're the dead boys!

I swallowed my gum.

What the h-

I mean- what the h-

do you want a record deal?!

Said sorry, you know?

Go!

Go!

Have a nice day.

May I help you?

Why would you save

for your dreams?

Why not live your dreams?

Absolutely.

Hilly Kristal.

How much do I have
in my account?

$312.17.

Keep the 17 cents.

I'll take the rest.

What are you doing, hilly?

Were you following me?
Me?

Follow you, no,
why would I follow you?

Yes, I'm following you!

What are you doing?

Investing.

In what?
Treasury bills?

I'm taking the money
out of the CBGB account

to float the dead boys
development fund.

That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

You can't.
You watch me.

We got bills to pay!

You have no vision, Merv.

Well, I quit!

I'll call you later!
I won't answer!

Oh, yes you will!
No, I won't!

I went to a pawnshop.

Sold everything.

My father's watch.

They destroyed your truck.

And their equipment.

They're gonna need equipment.

Why are you doing this?
I believe in them.

Hey.

Thank you.

Why are you thanking me?

Somebody should.

This is not the end
of the world.

I mean, this could be good
for us if we manage it right.

We are punks, after all.

Blitz might be dead.

The last thing I care about
is publicity for a band

who's about to cost me my club.

How is he?

He's, um- he's critical.

Fuck.

Do you still have the money?

Yeah.

Blitz is gonna need it.

Make sure he gets
good medical care.

Where you going?

I'm not your father!

I'm just your manager.

I can't do this anymore.

<i>[The Velvet Underground's
oh! Sweet nuthin']</i>

Jersey.

Hightstown.

Say a word for Jimmy brown

he ain't got nothin' at all

Not the shirt
right off his back

He ain't got nothin' at all

And say a word
for ginger brown

Walks with his head down
to the ground

Took the shoes

right off his feet

threw the poor boy
right out in the street

And this is what he said

oh sweet nothing...

Can I help you?

I'm sorry.

I grew up here.

Uh-huh.

Hilly Kristal.

Hilly Kristal.

Hilly.

Are you the kid that started
that rock 'n roll club?

Unfortunately, that's me.

My nephew's band
played there once.

Teenage Jesus and the jerks.

Coffee's inside, come on.

I saw a little bird

sitting in a tree

who wanted
to start a family

He went tweet,
tweet, tweet tweet

He were looking for a she

He couldn't wait
to find a mate

Sat in a tree
and sang a plea

He went tweet,
tweet, tweet tweet

He were looking for a she

Where the hell are you?!

Everybody is worried about you!

<i>I'm done. It's over.</i>

No, no way.
I won't let you.

I can't even pay the rent.

Yeah, you can.

And yes, you will.

Look, you may be a lousy
businessman, dad,

but, damn it, you are
the father of underground rock

and OMFUG, whatever
the hell that is.

And it's not all about you.

<i>Okay, there are kids
out there in bands</i>

or forming bands hoping
to play at CBGB one day.

<i>So stop feeling sorry for yourself
right now and get over here.</i>

Lisa, stop shouting
and feed Jonathan.

[Phone rings]

CBGB.

No. I don't have
the lineup for tonight.

<i>[Man] All right.</i>

[Phone rings]

CBGB.

Hey, hilly!

Hilly.

I just don't get it.

Why did you risk everything
on the dead boys?

Was it the auto-asphyxiation
or the self-mutilation?

They could've been
a bellwether.

That's debatable.

I'm going to law school.

Really?

How come?

Cause I know you're
gonna need me to.

Even though I know
you'll never admit it.

Your friends have been waiting out
there for you all fucking day.

Get your ass out there!

I really don't appreciate
all the swearing.

Um...

I know you all counted on me,
but the thing is, I'm broke,

and I think we're gonna have
to close the club.

Oh, God!

How many years have
we listened to your shit?

Lisa and I made a few calls.

A lot of calls.

And people wanted to help.

Yeah, like people
that you helped

even when you
didn't have the money.

But, uh...

Lisa's gonna take care of this.

She's gonna pay the bills.

She's gonna get the place
back on track.

I want you to have this.

It's all I got.

I have-I have a-
I have a...

Don't tell anybody.

I have a gold filling
in my tooth, in the back.

You could probably
take it out like this.

Thanks, Idaho.

Looks like I'm not gonna
need either of those.

Okay.

When you're ready.

Thank you, sir.
It's an honor to be here.

You play too loud,
I'm walking out.

All right, guys.
Anytime.

Roxanne

you don't have to put
on the red light

Those days are over

you don't have to sell
your body to the night

Roxanne

you don't have
to wear that dress tonight

Walk the streets for money

you don't care if it's wrong
or if it's right

Well, there is something there.

You don't have
to put on the red light

Roxanne...

There is definitely
something there.

Roxanne

put on the red light

Roxanne

put on the red light

Roxanne

put on the red light

Roxanne

put on the red light

Roxanne

put on the red light

I opened...

CBGB because...

I thought country music was
gonna become the next big thing.

And it did.

In Nashville.

Know my mind is made up

so put away your makeup

told you once,
I won't tell you again

It's a bad way

<i>[talking heads'
life during wartime]</i>

Heard of a van

it's loaded with weapons

packed up and ready to go

Heard of some grave sites

out by the highway

a place where nobody knows

The sound of gunfire

off in the distance

I'm getting used to it now

Lived in a brownstone

lived in a ghetto

I've lived
all over this town

This ain't no party

this ain't no disco

this ain't
no fooling around

No time for dancing

or lovey dovey

I ain't got time
for that now

Transmit the message

to the receiver

hope for an answer some day

I got three passports

a couple of visas

you don't even
know my real name

High on a hillside

the trucks are loading

everything's ready to roll

I sleep in the daytime

I work in the nighttime

I might not ever get home

this ain't no party

this ain't no disco

this ain't
no fooling around

This ain't no mudd club

or CBGB

I ain't got time
for that now

Talking heads,
get the hell up here please.

We wanna start
by thanking hilly Kristal.

We'd to invite hilly up here.

Hilly is the reason
that we're here,

that the Ramones are here,

that blondie are here.

He kept us alive.

He fed us and he supported us

in every way possible.

He told us we needed
to expand our sound,

and he taught us
a lot about ethics,

about how to treat people.

I'd like to thank hilly again.

When we were starting out,

there really weren't clubs

where bands could play
their own material,

and, uh, poor hilly wanted

to have a bluegrass bar
on the bowery,

and to have some
other music as well.

I guess the road
didn't go that way.

The road took another turn.

And, uh, thanks to-

I mean, we thank him,

because he went that
direction and didn't mind.

It was just extraordinary,

the fact that bands
came out of the woodwork.

They were everywhere.

They were coming
from out of state.

Nobody knew they were there.

They came out because
there was somewhere to play.

Hilly brought the music
into existence in many ways.


I saw a little bird

sittin' in a tree

who wanted to start
a family

Who went tweet, tweet

tweet, tweet

he went lookin' for a she

He couldn't wait
to find a mate

Sat in a tree
and sang a plea

He went tweet, tweet

tweet, tweet

he went looking for a she

There was a little bee

a- feelin' mighty free

some honey, he said
is good for me

He went a-buzz, buzz

a- buzz, buzz

he went looking for a she

you love me, I love you

Let's both do
what the birds and bees do

Buzz, buzz, buzz

tweet, tweet, tweet

that means I love you,
love you, love you

I love you all the time

isn't it a pity
that the lady from the city

Went inside a pen
and was taken for a hen

Turned her back
on a rooster

And when he promptly
goosed her

She received such
a bruise to her

More than she was used to

that she went back
to the city

And never came here again

isn't that a pity

isn't that a pity

that means I love you,
love you, love you

I love you all the time

that means I love you,
love you, love you, love you

All the time

that means I love you,
love you, love you

I love you all the time
