Hey, big guy.

Hey, what are you doing?

Looking for a guy like you.

So?

She said anal was 50.

Yeah?

I was driving over
there, and then I saw you

And that's why I grabbed you.

Oh, it was the red boots.

The red boots are nice, yeah.

That's all right.

Are those new?

They look new.

So?

Do you want to take them off?

Let's take off the boots.

All right.

So it's 50 for anal?

Well, I assumed
that was OK with you

Since you took me in your ride.


Your feet are dirty.

You're dirty.

Why is that one longer?

Why so many questions?

I'm just asking a
fucking question.

I'm not... I'm not...

Are your toes perfect?

I don't know.

I don't look at them, you know?

Toes are weird, though.

That's a weird area of the body.

The toe?

It's like a fucking...
It's like if a person were

Like an animal, those
would be like the claws.

Like a fucking talon,
like an eagle's talon.

That's like what the
feet are, you know?

The foot... the foot.

Well, I can take my shirt
off if you don't want

To look at the foot anymore.

OK.

That's good.

OK.

OK.

[Rock music playing]

[Speaking indistinctly]

Come on.

I don't have all day, tiger.

Yeah, it's mucho importante.

Mmm.

Sorry I'm two hours late.

Oh, that's OK.

Yeah, um, I went out
drinking last night

And had a little bit
too much. [Whistles] No,

I was just vomiting all day.

Oh.

So vomiting and
driving isn't good.

But I'm better now.

Oh, good, good.

ANGEL: Yeah, remember Kristy?

AUNT PEGGY: It's

KRISTY: Thank you.

AUNT PEGGY: I didn't

You look so great now.

You were all fat before,
and now you're all thin.

Oh, yeah.

You look better, too.

Yeah, it's been a

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah.

Sit down over here with me.

Yeah.


So how long are

Um, well, until I find
my own, um, apartment

If that's all right.

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah, you can
stay here as long as you want.

Don't worry about it.

We have an extra room.

You can have your own room.

Oh, wow.
Thank you.

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah, you can
just stay as long as you want.

Oh, well, thank you.

Maybe do the dishes
once in a while.

Oh, sure

You can do my dishes.

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah.

Sure.

That's fine.

Yeah.

Help out around the house.

Vacuum.

Take out the trash.

I hate the trash.

You can take out the trash.

AUNT PEGGY: Free rent like here.

She gets free rent all the time.

Of course.

Mom, who helps you out
with your medical bills.

Huh?

AUNT PEGGY: I don't think... I
don't think it's appropriate.

No?

Well, I'm happy to
help around the house.

It's a beautiful house.

AUNT PEGGY: Thank you.

Thank you.

It's an old house.

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah.

It's creepy.

KRISTY: I don't know.

AUNT PEGGY: I don't
think it's creepy.

I like it this way.

You know?

Do you have a boyfriend
or anything like that?

No, no.

Oh, good.

There weren't be any
weirdos coming to visit you.

Oh, no, no.

I don't know anyone here yet.

There's some very
strange people

Around this neighborhood.

It looked like a
nice neighborhood.

Well, that's... you know.

In California there's
weirdos everywhere.

You know that.

ANGEL: It's just the
Valley, Mom, come on.

AUNT PEGGY: Oh,
the Valley, yeah.

I've always lived in the Valley.

But I wish I could
live somewhere else.

[Rap music playing]

That was great!

You're a really good dancer!

ANGEL: Wow!

You're a great dancer.

She is a good dancer.

Yeah you're a great dancer.

Hey, hey, hey.

Um, that's Lush.

She's just sleeping.

Passed out.

Oh.

Uh, Kristy.

Cool.

I'm Grahm.

This is BC.

KRISTY: Hi.

BC, you don't have
to shake her hand.

It's not a job interview.

What the fuck, man?

This guy, I'll tell you,
maybe he's a retard, too.

I don't know.

So you're doing good?

Are you having fun?

Yeah.

How about you guys?

Are you guys having fun?

Yeah.
Yeah.

It's good.

We're doing real good, right?

You're friends with my cousin?

I know her from back in the day.

We still hang out sometimes.

I get her stuff.

Yeah.

I saw that.

Awesome.

Fuck, man.

Yeah.

That stuff's so good.

Where are you from?

Uh, I'm from Ohio.

GRAHM: You're from Idaho?

No, I'm from Ohio.

Oh, potatoes.

In Idaho they have... Idaho

So how you doing?

KRISTY: Um, I'm OK.

SHANNON: Hi.

How are you?
Good.

I'm Shannon.

Let me get a

BARTENDER: What kind of beer?

Just beer, man.

BARTENDER: How many cups?

Nah, no cups.

Hey, how's it going?

KRISTY: Good.

Good.

GRAHM: What are you doing?

Just getting a drink.

Is it good?

Yeah, it's good.

What do you... what
are you drinking?

KRISTY: Uh, rum and coke.

Oh, cool.
Is it good?

KRISTY: Yeah, it's good.

It's strong.

Like I think it's destiny
that you and I hook up.

Um, OK.

Um, I'm not really looking
for a boyfriend now.

So you're just looking
to do some fucking?

No.

No.

I... I just... I just...

I think you and I are supposed
to be together like fate.

I'm just... you know.

I just like being single.

GRAHM: So you want to fuck?

KRISTY: Uh, no.

You should open
your mind to it.

Destiny.

KRISTY: Well, no.

I don't believe in destiny.

Yeah.

OK.

You know, I'm
going to go inside.

All right?

See you around.


[Dance music playing]

What's up, honey tits?

Hey!

What's going on?

Um, just hanging out.

Waiting for some friends.

But I don't think
they're coming.

Oh, that's a bummer, man.

Yeah.

What are you going to do?

You guys are going to hang out?

Yeah, yeah.

You got any drugs on you?

Maybe, yeah.

Well, my place isn't
too far from here.

You want to go?

Yeah, let's go party.

Let's get crazy
Let's get stupid.

Let's get crazy.

GIRL: Yeah, all right.

Let's go.

You got a car?

[Muffled screams]

[Woman singing]

OK.

Good afternoon, class.

I'm Miss Crabtree.

Very nice to meet you.

Um, just to start off I'd
really like to call role.

So when I say your name,
please respond with here.

That would be great.

Kristy White.

KRISTY: Here.

Tristan?

This is full body singing.

This isn't just... row,
row, row your boat gently

Down the stream.

[Singing notes]

So what it is it's
basically start at one note,

And you walk up like a
staircase to a specific note.

And then you walk back down.

So.

[Singing notes]

So let's try that.

[Singing notes]

Actually, put your hand here.

[Clears throat]

Let me hit a note.

[Sings high note]

Can you feel anything?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah.

See, it's... it's...
It's vibration.

[Singing notes]

[Singing heavy metal]

ANGEL: You're doing the dishes?
Cool.

KRISTY: Uh-huh.

ANGEL: So I'm going to take
off for a little while.

KRISTY: OK.
ANGEL: And um...

[AUNT PEGGY SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY]

What, Ma?

AUNT PEGGY: She does
what she says going to.

She does what she
says she's going to do?

Of course, it's Kristy.

Anyways, so yeah.

Um, after the dishes, if
you can clean up the garage.

KRISTY: OK.

Then if you can rake the
leaves, take out the trash,

Make my bed.

Um...

KRISTY: I think I
should write this down.

Do you need beer, Ma?

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah.

She has to do all this
before you get back, right?

Yeah, you got to do that all
before I get back, though.

KRISTY: OK.

ANGEL: A little
domestic, you know?

KRISTY: OK.

ANGEL: Uh, just
use your own money

And... and I'll pay you back.

KRISTY: I'll use my credit card.

Yeah, use your credit card.

That would be great.

Right, Ma?

She's great.

So, uh, yeah, just
do, uh, do the dishes.

I got to go, but I'll be
back in a little while.

KRISTY: OK.

Cool.

Hey, Ma, I'm leaving.

OK.

Be careful out there.

Ma, this is warm beer.

You need some more.

Don't worry about me, Ma.

AUNT PEGGY: Yeah, make sure...
Are you getting the beer

Or is she getting the beer?

She's getting the beer.

I'm just going to go for awhile.

AUNT PEGGY: Where are you going?

I'm just going out.

Just going out.

Don't worry about me.

Everything's going to be fine.

Pretty.

Yeah, it's a nice day.

Yeah.

So I really like
this singing class.

You have a beautiful voice.

Thanks.

I don't know about
that teacher, though.

Oh, yeah?

I like her.

I can't believe you
know how to surf.

So are you going to
put on your wetsuit?

Yeah, eventually.

So do you come to
the beach every day?

Every day that I can.

Have you been surfing
for a long time?

Most of my life.

Wow.

Since you were a little girl?

Since I was a little girl.

KRISTY: Really?

You know, "Point Break" is
like one of my favorite movies.

Well, it's not like
it is in the movies.

Really?

No, it takes a lot of
work to learn how to do it.

Oh.

Do you think I
could... do you think

I could learn how to surf?

Could you teach me how to surf?

Well, if you really
want to, I can show you.

Maybe... maybe not today.


As as matter of fact, it looks
like it's starting to pick up.

I'm going to head out.
KRISTY: You are?

OK.

I'll just stay
here and watch, OK?

Sure.

Did you get your wetsuit
especially made for you?

No.

But this one fits like a glove.

Yeah.

Do you want me to zip you?

I got it.
You got it?

Thanks.

GRAHM: Kristy!

Hey, Kristy!

Hey, Kristy!

Kristy!

Kristy!

Over here!

Kristy!

Hey!

KRISTY: Hi.

Hey.

Hi.

It's Grahm from the
club the other night.

I recognize you.

Yeah, I recognize you, too.

So how's it going?

Fine.

You're just hanging out?

Yeah.

What are you doing here?

Just hanging out.

You know, just in nature.

Just hanging out
at the "be-ach".

[Clears throat]

A lot of waves today, man.

Yeah.

It's the beach.

Did you have fun at the
club the other night?

Uh, yeah.

It was pretty cool, yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah.

No Angel today, though, huh?

No.

What's she doing?

I think she's still asleep.

She didn't come till,
like, 10:00 this morning.

So...

What was she doing?

Working or something?

I don't know?

Does she sell stuff?

I don't know.

That's cool.

I don't know what you mean.

Party stuff.

I don't know.

Your legs have
some hair on them.

I forgot to shave.

Me, too

Yeah, your legs are hairy.

So what are you
going to do later?

I'm going to go
to singing class.

Oh, OK.

Yeah, all day.

Because I thought maybe that,
uh, you know the way things

Ended or whatever
the other night maybe

We should give it another go.

Well, I have my
singing class so.

So yeah, no.

So you're probably
going to do that.

Yeah.

That's all day?

That's all day.

It's like a workshop.

What the fuck does that mean?

It means it's all day.

And night?

Well, at night I'm
just going to go home.

What are you going to do there?

Watch TV.

That's a pretty bathing suit.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Look at that girl running.

God.

Yep.

Won't your voice get sore?

Your throat muscles?

Won't your throat get
a little bit tender?

No, I just drink a lot of tea.

I drink a lot of chamomile tea.

I knew a girl one time who
was drinking a lot of tea.

She was always pissing green.

It was always green her piss.

I think I just saw a dolphin.

Really?

Yeah.

Where?

It was out there by
that chick surfing.

That's my friend.

Oh, yeah?

What's her name?

Sarah.

Sarah.

Dolphins are real
sexual animals.

I don't think so.

They are.

I think they're
more like humans.

Exactly.

Well, I mean,
they're just smart.

I think they're smart.

I don't think
they're that smart

Or they'd be walking around...

They don't have legs.

Having food and shit.

You know what I mean?

No.

That's how you prove
that they were smart.

No, they rescue humans.

What the fuck is that?

They rescue humans.

They're like
water bound lassie?

What the fuck is this?

Kind of.

What's up?

Hi.

I'm Grahm.

What's your name?

Sarah.

Cool.

Grahm.

Nice to meet you.

Yeah.

My pleasure.

How are you?

Uh, OK.
I'm good.

I'm good.

You doing some
surfing out there?

Yeah, trying to.

I'm a boogie boarder.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah, It's like two or three
times harder than surfing.

I do body surfing, too.

But boogie boarding is
kind of my speciality.

Right.

GRAHM: You'll have to come out
here sometime and watch me.

It's hard, though, like my
muscle's get all ripped up.

I get all swollen.

Maybe we should get going.

What are you guys going to do?

Singing class.

Oh, yeah?

Suit hard to get out of?

I can't get out
of it fast enough.

KRISTY: Yeah.

GRAHM: That's the cool thing
about boogie boarding, too.

I don't even wear a suit.

KRISTY: Yeah.

OK.

Yeah.

Do you want me to
get your towel?

Sure, thanks.

You want me to help
you carry anything?

KRISTY: No.

I'll see you around.

KRISTY: Yeah.

Yeah.

KRISTY: Maybe.

Nice to know you.

That man was strange.

Yeah, you know, I
think he's following me.


[Tapping foot]

You feel the beat.

It's important.

[Singing notes]

OK.

So next up, Belinda.

Would you like to come up?

And I'd like to hear
you individually.

OK.

All yours.

the little children.

All the children of the world.

Red and yellow, black and white,
they are precious in his sight.

Jesus loves the little
children of the world.

Jesus loves the little children.

All the children of the world.

Red and yellow, black and white,
they are precious in his sight.

Jesus loves the little
children of the world.

that doggy in the window.

I do hope that doggy's for sale.

Ruff, ruff!

all of war and blood.

And I stand with your
letters in my hand,

Dripping through your tears.

Sky is raining down,
and I see the crows

Flying through the sky.

And I know that they
will take me away.

Will take me away!

Will take me away!

Very nice, yeah.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Very nice, very nice.

Thank you very much.

[Light applause]

All right, so I think the only
one who hasn't come up here

Is Andrew.

So Andrew, if you'd
like to come up front.

Uh, I just want to... like
I said before, I just

Want to get, um, a sense
of what you sound like,

What your style is.

Style is very important.

And um, so whatever
you'd like to sing.

All right.

OK.

(SINGING SCREAMO) Catch
them and kill them.

They will die as they sleep.

Catch them and kill them.

Shotgun bang, it will rain.

OK.

Well, I think you have
a very strong style.

And, um, I think perhaps...
And this is just a suggestion

And it's part of learning...
That perhaps if you, um,

It sounds like you're coming
a little bit from here.

And you know you
should be pulling it

Up more from your diaphragm
and from your chest.

So maybe something
more like this.

[Clears throat]

(SINGING SREAMO) Eh,
kill them and catch them.

[Music playing]

GIRL: Yeah, I'm going to
this party down at the beach.

GRAHM: Yeah?

What's... what's going on?

What kind of party?

GIRL: Oh, I don't know.

A party like bands, drugs.

GRAHM: Yeah, yeah.

GIRL: You know.

GRAHM: A good party.

GIRL: I hope so.

GRAHM: You ever been to
one on the beach before?

GIRL: No.

GRAHM: You've never
gotten down there?

GIRL: No.

GRAHM: Oh, that's
mucho importante.

I like to party.
GIRL: Do you?

GRAHM: Yeah, I party.

I fucking rip it up.

GIRL: Yeah?

GRAHM: I tear it up real good.

[Rock music playing faintly]

Holy shit.

Fuck!



Let's get high.

That was some good fucking.

Yeah.

You're pretty hot.

I'm... I'm pretty
good at fucking, yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah.

This stuff's hard.

I had this girl
in here last week.

Oh, gosh.

She was such a
dirty, dirty slut.

Oh, man.

I just railed her.

Put a wax job all over her
arm and all over her stomach.

Uh, OK.

Let's... let's...

Yeah, yeah, I got to go.

GRAHM: No.

I got to go to the party.

My... people are waiting for me.

GRAHM: No, that's cool.
I got to go.

GRAHM: We need to fuck again.
I need to fuck again.

No, no.

I got to... I got to go.

GRAHM: Let's fuck again.
I got to go.

GRAHM: No, we're
going to fuck again.

No, no.
I got to go.

GRAHM: We're going to fuck!

I have to go.

No, no!


GRAHM: Right here's the party.

[Rock music playing]


[Music playing]

DEER: Wake up.

What do I look like to you?

A deer.


The deer talks.

The deer talks.

My ex-boyfriend was in prison.

With him?

With Charles Manson?

Not with Charlie Manson,
he's in his own cell.

See, I told you
what kind of people...

I... I know some people.

She hangs out with.

You can't be with
those kind of people.

Yeah, so no.

Charlie Manson...
In every year they

Go... he goes for like parole,
and they keep denying him.

But he has his own
little cell up there.

And he's like two hours away.

Well, it does happen.

I mean, if you watch
the news every day...

And I do watch the news.

Oh, shit.

Here it is.

Ah, you were sitting on it.

I want to see that.

No, wait, wait.
Go back.

Wait, wait.
Go back.

Killer strikes again.

Still on the loose in
the San Fernando Valley.

Brutal murder?

See, that's why I
never go outside.

I stay right here on the couch.

That's kind of scary.
Right here on the couch.

It can be scary.

Yeah, scary, huh?

You have to be
very careful when

You go out around
this neighborhood

Or any neighborhood.

You're in California.

I always ask people to
walk me out to the car.

You're not in Ohio anymore.

This is California, so
you've got to be very

Careful of who you talk to.

Crazy people.

So it's good you're here.

You can help keep me safe.

Oh, yeah, of course.

Sit on the couch with her.

[Vacuum whirring]

KRISTY: You all done
with lunch, Aunt Peggy?

All done?

Did you like it?

Yeah?

Everything will be fine.

No, she can't go out.

Don't worry.

This is just normal.

There's a serial

ANGEL: Mom!
And she's not going out.

I told her she

Just stay down and
sit with me, because...

ANGEL: Mom!
Get those pills.

Get those pills in the kitchen.

I'm not cooling down, and
I'm not taking anything else.

Mom, don't worry.

That's why I don't move off
this couch, because she... she

Changes her pills for my pills.

Everything's going to be fine.

AUNT PEGGY: She's got
to stay here with me.

You've just got to chill out.
