    Summer.

    Honey.

                You may approach
                the bench.

We're nearly there.

Do you want
the hummus sandwich
I made you?

                I told you
                I'm not hungry.

It's vegan.

    Ladies and gentlemen,

    we expect to land
    in about 15 minutes.

    Thank you for flying
    with Alitalia,

and we hope to see you
again in the near future

 onboard our flights.
<i> Arrivederci.</i>

Summer, look.

        Wait. They have
        geological formations
        in Europe, too?

Look, honey,
there's nothing

you can do for him
right now, OK?

So in the meantime,
you have 2 weeks

to just simply relax.

And I'm telling you,

you're gonna love
this country,

the people, the food,
the gelato.

        I should be
        by Tyler's side
        fighting for his rights,

        and you're trying
        to buy me off
        with ice cream?

        This is about injustice.

There's injustice here,
too, trust me.

                Oh, I'm pleased.

No, seriously,
this country is, like,
famously corrupt.

They have fascism,
social inequality.

People are eating
out of garbage cans.

        I thought you said
        the food was good.

It is. It--It's so good

that people are eating it
out of the garbage cans.

All I know is
that when I was your age,

I loved being here.

        When you were my age,
        you were a virgin

        with a Prozac
        dependency.

That's not true.

        Yeah, I've seen
        the photos of the zits
        and the braces.

That was
junior high school.

And actually,
when I was here,

I had a boyfriend,
and he was very handsome.

Â¶ Someone to watch over me Â¶

    Â¶ I couldn't ask you
    for more Â¶

Â¶ Oh oh,
oh oh, oh oh Â¶

    Â¶ Why do I long
    to be free Â¶

    Â¶ But cry when you
    walk out the door? Â¶

Â¶ You got me going round
like a record now Â¶

    Â¶ I wanna show my love,
    but I don't know how Â¶

Â¶ I know that I'm a mess Â¶

Â¶ But I pray
you'll stick around... Â¶

        I got it. I got it.
        Thank you.

        Check the tag. The tag.
        Check the tag.

        That's mine.

        Oh.
                    Hey.

    Oh, is this yours?

                    Yes.
        I'm sorry.

        Looks--Take it.

                    OK.
Looks like my old bag.

Â¶ Take me to your treetops
growing up... Â¶

            Excuse me. It looks
            like my old one.

            Sorry.

        Come on, little duck.

Â¶ But we'll both go slow Â¶

    Â¶ Ooh, ooh ooh ooh,
    ooh ooh ooh Â¶

    Â¶ Ooh, ooh ooh ooh,
    ooh ooh ooh Â¶

            <i> Signorina, scusi.</i>
            <i> Per favore.</i>

        Oh, you've gotta
        be kidding me.

                Can I have
                your passport,
                please?

            Sure.

            Purpose of visit?
I'm being kidnapped...

    We're on vacation.
by my own mother.

    She's making a joke.

            Wait a second,
            please.

        Jesus, Summer.

    Mm?

        Take your glasses off.

                    Yeah?

            Do you have
            any criminal record?

        N-No, and she's
        not about to get one
        right now, either.

You just lied
to an agent of the law.

        It's a juvenile record.

        It's in the process
        of being expunged,

        and it's really just
        an administrative
        thing now.

You told an untruth.

        Well, technically
        I did not.

                Ah. See?

            Ah, it's so relaxing
            in Italy.

            People are
            so laid-back.

        Ah,<i> buongiorno.</i>

        <i> Buongiorno. Ciao.</i>

            Hello. I have a--

            <i> una--una</i>
            <i> reservazione.</i>

Just have to...

            find the number.

            But I know
            it's under the name
            Mrs. Falk.

            Marg--Well, Maggie.

        Yes.
                Maggie.

    I will need
    the reservation number.

            Yes, but I also
            have the, um--

        That's the credit card
        that I booked on.

    I'm sorry.
    No number, no booking.

            Come on.
            What's a little--

            What's
            a little number
            between<i> amici,</i> huh?

             I'm sure
             you can scrounge up

            a little
            convertible,
            you know, um...

            <i> una Fiat bella.</i>

            <i> Tutto e bellissima.</i>

    I'm sorry.

That is the least
<i> bellissima</i> car ever.

That is
antique<i> bellissima.</i>

            It's eighties.

            You love
            the eighties.

The eighties revival
is totally over.

            Well, can't you
            like it ironically

            or whatever it is
            you kids do?

The irony revival
is totally over, too.

You have to like things
sincerely now.

                Mm.

            I like it sincerely.

            On the road,
            just the two of us,

            sisters doing it
            for ourselves.

Ah, seriously.

        "Thelma and Louise."

Thelma and Louise
drove off a cliff
and killed themselves.

Oh! God!

            Sorry.

    Yep, super relaxed here.

    Unlike Dad's new pile
    in the Hamptons,

    where I should
    totally be instead.

        Last time
        you stayed with him,

        he took you
        out drinking.

I try to see him taking me
as an act of trust.

            Oh, God.
            Please don't tell me

            what his
            less trustworthy
            acts are.

    Exactly. I won't.
    I'm not telling you
    anything about anything,

     which is why you don't know
     anything about my life

    and you keep trying
    to protect me

from things I don't need
to be protected from.

        Is your seat belt on?

    Yes.

Tranquility.

Yep, pure tranquility

with Tyler unjustly rotting
in the penal system.

            Ah, brother.

It's a harmless
medicinal herb.

5 kilos
   of a harmless
   medicinal herb.

        Marijuana laws are
        a tool for the state

        to oppress
        the underclass.

            Underclass?
            His mother owns
            a gallery

            on the Upper
            East Side.

You're so racist!

            He's white!

No, he's not.
He's 1/8 Native American.

There was a genocide.

        Summer, honey, baby,

        I just don't want you
        dragged into this.

        He wants you
        to pretend that they
        were your drugs.

He never asked me
to do that.

        Well, that's not
        the impression you gave.

        The impression you gave
        is that he wants you

        to go back
        on your deposition,
        to perjure yourself,

        and to say that it
        was you all along.

No! I was speaking
hypothetically.

If I took the rap,
it'd just be
a juvenile sentence,

which doesn't count,
technically speaking.

        Do you have any idea
        how hard it was

        to get your record
        for theft overturned?

It wasn't theft.
It was liberation.

Those rabbits
needed to be free.

        Summer, Summer,
        this is drug dealing.
        It would be perjury,

        and it would
        look awful on your
        college application.

I hate you!

        I know you do.
        I know you do.

Summer. Whoa, Summer!

Get off!

        Don't--That's not safe.
    Ow!

        That's really dangerous!
Ow! My foot's stuck!

            I don't care.

You're so controlling!

No wonder Dad left you...

for his 23-year-old
legal secretary
called Amber.

        I'm sorry. What, honey?
Whatever.

Just give me my bag.
I need my phone.

Give me my bag!

Fine.
I'll get it myself.

Where's my stupid phone?

    Aah!

            Oh, honey, look.

It's--Wow.

            It's gotta be here
            somewhere.

    I'm sorry.
    Sorry, sorry.

            Where the hell's
            my phone?

        Oh, sorry, Ms. lady,
        but we're almost there.

            Sorry.

        Wow.
        It's exactly the same.

        20 years
        in the blink of an eye.

                Ohh.

            It's really
            something, isn't it?

                Oh.

Where is it?

        Where's what?
        Oh, you know what?

        I have to remember
        to write to Uncle George

        and thank him--
My cell phone,

which I strongly
suspect you stole.

        Well, that would be
        very uncharacteristic
        of me.

        I am someone
        people steal from.

Give it to me!

        I don't have it.

            Gosh.

            Oh, calm dow--

            Calm down.
Please!

            I don't have it.

    Give it to me!
                I don't...

<i> Buongiorno.</i>

You rented
the cottage
from George?

I live opposite, so...

            Luca?

    Maggie?

        I thought--

        I thought
        you moved to France.

I moved back.

I bought the old farm,
the villa.

        The big villa?

                This cannot
                be happening.

She must be your sister?

                She wishes.

        This is--
        This is Summer.

        She's my daughter.

Your daughter.

I can't believe this.

        I know.
        Me neither. It's--

May I invite you
for a drink in--
in my garden?

        Oh, that's--
        that's very nice,

        but we just got here,

        and we haven't
        even unpacked, and--

I understand.

But if you change
your mind,

you are very welcome.

    Bye.

                Bye.

                Ma.

                Ma!

        Yep?

                Is he
                why we're here?

        No.

    No, no, God, no. I--

    I had no idea.
    I thought he moved away.

                You knew
                he was back.

    I haven't thought of him
    in 20 years.

                Yeah, right.

            Sheez.

                    Yo.

Oh, my God.
Tyler, you're out.

You made bail?

            Didn't you, uh,
            get my text?

My--My mom's such a bitch.

I think she stole my phone.
How crazy is that?

            Babe, you have got
            to get back here.

            If you don't
            get back and take
            the rap for this,

            I am going down,

            like down to a place

            even lower down
            than, like,
            Chinatown low.

I know,
but it's complicated.

        Complicated is
        how I'm gonna feel...

    Tyler.
        if I go down for this.

I'll try and
get home, OK? I--

I love you, Tyler.

                    Stop it.

                    You do?

I'll find a way.

I promise.

                OK.

            Maybe we should go
            say hello, you know?

            Might seem rude
            not to.

            You settling in?

        Mm-hmm.

It's nice, isn't it?

                Yeah.

        Oh, see? This must
        be his pottery.

        It's pretty colors.

            Wow.

                    Hey.
            Hey.

                You came
                after all.

            Come. Let me
            offer you something.

        Oh, no. I mean,
        you don't need to go
        to any trouble.

            Ah, come on.
            I insist.

    You are my guests.
    Come on.

Wow.

                The villa.
    The villa, yes.

                The villa.

                So...

            you married--
            What was it? Jock?

Jack. Jack.
                Oh, Jack.

    I'm happy
    everything worked out.

            I mean, actually,
            we were--

we were divorced
last year,

so i-it didn't...

                I'm sorry
                to hear that.

No, no, no.
It's OK.

                Just--
Please, sit down.

            I'll bring some food

            and something
            to drink.

            Wine, that's OK?

        Sure. Sure.

                    Amarone?

Oh.

        <i> Grazie.</i>
                    <i> Prego.</i>

"Actually, we were
divorced last year."

"Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, baby."

                    What?

                    No.

                Honey, no. No.

                He's--

            he's being polite.

By sexing you?

Ah.

            I'm fairly certain
            he isn't,

            and, um,
            sexing people

            is a form
            of politeness here.

                <i> Ciao.</i>

        <i> Ciao.</i>

                    Ah.

                    This is
                    my darling
                    Valentina.

            Maggie and Summer.

I will
   wake Mamma as well

            so she can meet you.
            You remember Carmen?

        <i> Non Ã¨ possibile.</i>

            <i> Grazie, Antonio.</i>

            <i> Grazie, Antonio.</i>

    It gets worse and worse.

            And now she tries
            to run away.

            Lucky she
            does not drive,

            otherwise,
            I would have to lock

            the garage as well.

    <i> Buongiorno, Carmen.</i>

        Her memory
        is not so good.

        Excuse me one second.

    <i> Sei l'Americana.</i>

                <i> SÃ¬.</i>

            <i> SÃ¬, l'Americana.</i>

                <i> Ciao.</i>

            <i> Ciao.</i>

    Well, it's wonderful to see
    how your art has developed.

            Oh, no, these pieces
            are just rustic
            for tourists.

            In the village,
            I have a small shop.

             In Firenze,
             I have a gallery.

"Fine Art Ceramics."

        For collectors with
        more money than sense.

            Would you like
            to see my studio?

    Oh, we should probably
    head back, right?

No, no. You go ahead.

I'll watch Mamma for you.

    All right, I'll just take
    a very fast look around, OK?

        Where's the garage?

        Whatever, dude.
        I'll find it myself.

                    Whoa.
My studio.

                Incredible.

Do you like it?

            Yeah, it's--

            it's fantastic.

    Ah, yes,
    the trophy wall.

            I draw inspiration
            from all kinds
            of people.

    But largely female
    and attractive.

            You are really
            living the dream.

Sure, I do.

And the journalism?

            Journalism? Mm.

        I teach journalism...
Mm.

        at city college.

        You know, just between
        now and, um,

        my next Pulitzer.

Of course.

So you have the career,

a wonderful daughter--

        I have
        a wonderful daughter

        with radical
        anarchist leanings.

            And I, um--

            I have
            an ex-husband

        who has lawyered himself
        out of his alimony,

        and, uh, whatever
        meager free time I have

        I spend perfecting
        my online sudoku game.

    Oh.

                    Awesome.

            You help me,
            I help you.

Whatever, Grandma.

Let's get out of here.

        Those are
        pretty colors.

Ah.

            This is great.

            Maggie.
        Sweet.

            I just wanted
            to say that,

            after all
            these years,

            I'm very happy
            to see you again.

Oh!

                Oh, my God.
    It's OK. It's OK.

It's OK. Maggie.
    Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

    My God.

                    Summer!

    She took my mamma.

        I don't under--
        Where are they going?

I don't know. Call her.

            I can't call her.
            She doesn't
            have a phone.

A teenage girl
with no phone?

            I--I sort of
            confiscated it.

You stole her phone?

Let me drive.

    No, no.
    I'm OK to drive.

            Are you sure?
    Yes.

            I hope Mamma
            can take all this.

            You know her heart
            is not very strong.

        I'm sorry.
        It's my fault.

What's wrong
with your daughter, anyway?

            Like I said,
            it's complicated.

        Her boyfriend is
        in trouble for drugs,

        and he wants her
        to take the blame.

        He wants to use her.

        She's easily led.

            <i> Grazie.</i>

        They've left
        the village,

        took off
        to the west.

            All right, so
            she's heading back
            to the airport,

so we'll just
meet her there, right?
Can you hand me my bag?

Can you just get
the passports?

                    Here?
They're in my purse, yeah.

                Just get
                the passports.

There is
only one passport.

                What?
Yeah. I think it's yours.

            Well, you just--
OK, but--

No. No.

            My credit card's
            missing.

OK, let me drive.

            Her passport's gone,
            and my credit card's
            missing.

            No, I can drive!
OK, let me drive.

You control
the passports and...

            I'll drop you
            at the next place.

<i> Devo andare a Roma.</i>

        I'm not going
        to Rome, dearie.

        Trust me, I'm going
        straight to NYC.

            <i> Aeroporto.</i>

    Roma.
            <i> Aeroporto.</i>

    Roma.

        <i> Aeroporto,</i> comrade.

    Roma!

            You psycho!
            You broke my face!

            This is my face
            you broke!

    Seat belt.

        Hold on.
        That's airport, right,

        <i> "aeroporto"?</i>
         To the right.

            Yeah, yeah, yeah.
        No?

            But my mother,
            God bless,

            she wants
            to go to Rome.

    Well, my daughter,
    God bless her,
    occupied Wall Street.

    I tell you, they're
    going to the airport.

You know, your daughter
will give in to my mamma,

and they will go to Rome.
Please.

        Wow. Now you know
        my daughter better
        than I know my daughter.

Insofar as it is
truly possible--

        I just meant that as
        a rhetorical question.

Rhetorical question,
it is Italian, so...

        Listen to me.
        I am 100% positive

        they are going
        to the airport.

    You wanna go
    to the airport
    or to Rome?

            You must feel
            pretty freaking good
            about yourself.

    Yes.

            I think we should
            call the police.

        No.

Why not?

        Look, she's a good kid.

        I just don't want her
        to get in trouble again.

She had run-ins
with the police before?

            No, no, no.

        Well, yes, but...

        I mean, it wasn't
        anything, you know--

        It wasn't serious.

        She just liberated
        some rabbits,

        you know,
        for ethical reasons.

    Oh.

From an experimental
laboratory?

        Well, from a pet store,

        but the conditions
        were dep--

        Look, they'll stop soon,
        right?

        I mean, they'll get
        hungry, and you guys
        have siesta, right?

        So they'll just...

This plan sucks.

                Wow.

            Look.
            There's a snack bar
            up ahead.

            I reckon we've
            got some distance,

            and I could really
            use a coffee.

First time in Italy?

            Yep. Uh-huh.

You like it?

        It's everything
        I dreamed of.

You staying
for long time?

        No, as a matter of fact.

        I'd like
        to get out of here
        as quickly as possible.

        Do you think
        you can check

        when the next flight
        to New York leaves?

        On your computer.

    Please. It's important.

Ah, we've lost them.

        No, no, no. Trust me.
        Take that small road.

                What, that one?

Yeah, that one.
                    Why?

        Because it's quicker.
        Turn. Turn.

I am.

        Yeah, we will have
        the advantage.

    OK.

                VoilÃ .

                Or whatever.

        <i> Arrivederci,</i> grandma!

What the...

    Roma.

                Fine.

            Rome first, and then
            I'll fly from there.

                Deal?

            How far is it
            to Rome, anyway?

    300<i> chilometri.</i>

            300 kilometers?
            It'll be the middle
            of the night

            before we get there
            if we don't take
            the<i> autostrada.</i>

<i> No autostrada.</i> No hurry.

3:00 tomorrow.

            You're supposed
            to be there
            at 3:00 tomorrow?

            Why is it
            so important?

            What is it
            you have to do?

            I hope you realize
            what a sacrifice
            I'm making here.

        I have someone
        waiting for me
        in New York, you know.

        He needs help, or
        he's gonna go to jail,

        and I'm the only one
        who can save him.

        I guess you wouldn't
        understand that.

    Why?

        Because I love him.

And he loves me, too.

But he says that if
I don't help him now,

we'll have
no future together.

            You know,
            he's desperate.

            He's been waiting
            for days already.

<i> Ho aspettato 50 anni.</i>

        Hey, that's...

I needed.

You're sure they're gonna
come by here, right?

                Yes. 100%.

    What's that,

    that picture?

            Nothing.

        Hey, you.

        I tell you
        about me and Tyler,

        and you say, "Nothing."

            How's that fair?

            Who's that?

            "Candy & Marcel."

Candy, Carmen.

            Is this you?

<i> E Marcellino.</i>

        What were you,
        part of some pop group
        or something?

    <i> SÃ¬.</i>

We were very young,

and Marcello Gaspari--

...arrive in my town,

and we sing together.

We made a tour
in Napoli, Roma, Firenze,

and I felt
in love with him,

but I had to go home.

I was supposed
to get married.

<i> Avevo promesso.</i>

            To Luca's father?

    Yes.

            So what happened?

        What?

            I mean, why did you
            marry an asshole
            like Jack?

I guess I didn't
think he was that big
of an asshole.

What about you? Hmm?

                What?

Tell me you were serious
about one woman,

one woman...
                    Ohh.

in your entire life.

                    Heh.

Yeah, I'd like to hear this.

                I take all women
                seriously.

                This is
                my most serious
                subject.

                Really.

            But, see,
            there was one woman.

    Yeah, what?
    It didn't work out?

             She had, um--
            <i> Come se dice?</i>

            A fistfight
            with my mother.

Heh. She had a fistfight
with your mother?

                Yes.
Wow. Who won?

                    My mother.

        Your mother.

            Anyway, her nose
            was too fat.

    What? W-Wow.

    What? Really?

            Yes.

Really?
Here I am.

I'm trying to have, like,
a sincere conversation,

but it's with this guy,
this so--

he's this
superficial guy...

            Oh, my God.
very superficial guy.

            That's it.
            That's why, no?

            Because I was
            too superficial?

        No.

    Actually, they were
    two of the nicest months
    of my life.

        Last year,
        my husband died.

        I cry a lot.

But one day,
I receive letter.

                From Marcellino?

1, 2, 3 letters.

<i> Segreto.</i>

        <i> Segreto?</i> Secret?

Big, big secret.

        Oh, my God.

        You're getting married?

Tomorrow, 3:00.

Santa Caterina
dei Funari.

        So we're the same,
        you and Marcellino,
        me and Tyler.

It's not comparable.

Tyler is trouble.

He's asshole.

                No.

            He's just kinda...

Asshole.

Heh. Use you.

No honor.

            <i> Eh! La strada</i>
            <i> Ã¨ libero.</i>

<i> Â¶ E tutta a un tratto Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Mi son messa a ballar Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Twist, twist Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Ho pensato a te Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Yeah, twist, twist Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Se tu stavi con me Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Twist, twist Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Avresti ballato anche tu Â¶</i>

        Anyway, it would
        never have worked.

        I'm an artist,
        and I need a woman
        who is not so uptight.

I'm not uptight?
            No?

No, just unlike
some people,

I have responsibilities.

        That's what people say
        when they have

        a pathological need
        to be in control.

Then how come I always
feel out of control?

        You controlling types
        always feel like that.

That's why you don't--

        you don't let me drive.

That's not why.

                No?
    Mm-mmm.

        So give me the kiss.

    What?
            Give me the kiss.

I'm not gonna give you the kiss.
            Come on.

            Come here.
Oh! Luca, oh, my God.

<i> Â¶ Ho visto ballare</i>
<i> il twist... Â¶</i>

        Don't flatter yourself.
        The keys.

Oh.

        <i> Â¶ Twist, Twist Â¶</i>
 Oh, no!

    <i> Â¶ Ho pensato a te,</i>
    <i> twist, twist... Â¶</i>

<i> Non mi sorprende.</i>

    <i> Â¶ Twist, twist... Â¶</i>

        No! Now what?!

Let's go.

                Let's go!
Yeah. Let's go.

Now we better
call the police.

    Oh, no. There must be
    another option. Please.

            Another option.
            Oh, another option.

            I've got a friend
            who is a TV
            presenter.

            Maybe if they
            mention it on TV,

            someone is
            bound to notice
            an old Alfa, no?

        Is there--
        Is there a "but"?

    No, no. No.

OK. Well,
then let's go.

            Giulia?

        <i> Luca, tesoro!</i>

        <i> Sono qui in piscina.</i>

<i> Grazie.</i>

            This is Maggie.

            She's a journalist,
            too.

Um...

Giulia Carni.
Please sit down.

So you have
a picture?

        Oh, yes.
    Yes.

        Just, um, here.

            Um...

        Here's--That's
        my daughter Summer.

<i> Ah, bella Carmen.</i>

            You carry a picture
            of your mother?

                    Yeah.
It's sweet, no?

Ah.

Paola.

<i> SÃ¬? Arrivo.</i>

                Send the picture
                to the station

                so they
                are prepared

when I get there.
        <i> Va bene.</i>

I'm sure Giulia
will do her very best.

        Oh, I'm sure she will.
    Yeah.

She seems very, um...

dedicated,

no matter what she does.

What?

            Are you jealous?

 I'm not jealous, just--

Ah, actually I guess
I'm not surprised.

A lady in every town.

            Oh, come on.

        OK, what can I say?

        When love calls,
        a man must act.

Are you kidding me?

No.

            A man takes
            what he wants
            when he wants.

"A man--"

            "A man takes

            what he wants
            when he wants it"?

                    Wow.

I'm joking. Come on.

What happened
to your sense of humor?

I like it
when you're jealous.

            Oh, my God.

            Where are we,
            the spaghetti
            western frontier?

        Â¶ Who's Â¶

Â¶ Gonna let you down tonight? Â¶

        Â¶ Who's... Â¶

Wow. Check it out.

        I got a mighty thirst,
        partner.

        How's the sarsaparilla?

            Ooh. This town
            ain't big enough
            for the both of us.

<i> Cosa hai detto?</i>

        You seriously
        don't speak any English?

        That's
        so cross-culturally
        awesome.

        <i> Due panini, per favore.</i>

            <i> Due.</i>

<i> ...americana, Summer Falk...</i>

            "Nonna-napper"?
            What does it mean?

<i> Sbrigati.</i>

                Hey!
Hurry!

            <i> Va bene. Va bene.</i>
            <i> Grazie.</i>

Grazie.

        There have already
        been several reports

        from people who thinks
        they've seen the car
        in this area.

Oh, thank God.

OK, so what do we do now?

            We wait.

Shouldn't we
go after them?

I mean, why don't
we go meet them
at the airport in Rome?

        No, no, no. If they
        go to the airport,
        they will be caught.

            They will not allow
            a minor on a flight

            without permission
            from a parent
            or guardian.

        Relax.
        It will soon be dark,

        and, uh--and we
        need to rest.

        So will they.

<i> Sono stanca.</i>

We stop for night.

            We can't, Carmen.
            I'm all over the TV,

            wanted by police
            as a Nonna-napper,

            which is a joke.

We stop to sleep.

            Don't you get it?

            They'll recognize us
            at any hotel.

No hotel.

Just sleep.

I was expecting a motel.

        This is how we do.

"This is how we do"?

                Yeah.

Well...

        This is
        idiomatic expression.

Yeah. No, I--
I know what it is.

I'm just...

    Feel sort of
    underdressed.

            A little.

        Excuse us.

                <i> Buonasera.</i>
                <i> Buonasera.</i>

            You want to try?

What? No.
            Come here.

    How do you mean no?

        I'm very good
        with that, eh,

         with the waltz?

Are you good?

Good enough.

Separate rooms, please.

    I'm sorry, madam,

    but we do have
    only one room left tonight.

            Are you kidding me?

                    Oh.

                Oh, oh, oh, my.

                    Oh.

        It's OK.

        I'll sleep on the floor.

        Oh! Valentina.

                    Oh.

    She must be
    worried by now.

                Of course.

<i> Valentina, tesoro.</i>

<i> SÃ¬, scusa, amore...</i>

            Good night, Carmen.

<i> Buona note.</i>

Oh! What?

        You said you were
        sleeping on the floor.

Oh, my God. Yes.

        You said you were
        sleeping on the floor.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it
was too uncomfortable.

        Maggie, I have
        to tell you something
        very important.

            Yeah?

            Your body
            still look banging.

            Really.

                    Ow.

                What--What did--
                Oh! Oh, my God!

    Oh!
        Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

                Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Did I--

Did I do that?

            Yes, you did it.
            You did it.

Let me see. Are you OK?

I hope it hurts.

Hope it hurts.

            Ow! My God,

you're terrible.

                Wow.

                    Wow.

A red Alfa has been
spotted near a lake
not far from here.

            They have probably
            camped overnight.

                What?

Your eye,

it's a little red.

Does it still hurt?

                Oh.

 Here.

Here you are.

Ay, yeah.

    Ah.

It's better, right?

            You're a bad person.

            Good body,
            but bad person.

They've gotta

Summer!

Now, the car.

I have<i> forbici.</i>

            Forbi-what?

<i> Forbici.</i>

                Go.

Oh! Summer!

How much further
is it?

    Not far.

    <i> Solo un'ora.</i>

            An hour?

            You'll have
            plenty of time.

    <i> Â¶ Twist, twist Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Avresti ballato</i>

            Are you nervous?

    Mm.

        Not as nervous
        as you would have been

        if you'd been forced
        to keep living with
        your overprotective son.

        I know how that feels.

 You don't know.

<i> Sei solo</i>
<i> una bambina capricciosa.</i>

You think you know,
but you know nothing yet.

        Hey, just because
        I haven't lived
        as long as you

        doesn't mean
        that my emotional life
        is any less advanced.

        For your information,

        I happen to love Tyler

        just as much as you
        love your old man.

    OK.

Maggie,

        we should call
        the police,

        no matter
        what you think.

            OK?

My God.

I'm such
a terrible mother.

I tried. I tried.
I really tried.

I don't know.
Where did I go wrong?

        First you stole
        her phone, and then--

Yes, I know that.

I'm talking about
in general.

How did it
all come to this?

                I think
                he is right.

                You should call
                the police.

            Hey, I saw it
            on television.

            Everybody did.

            Your daughter is
            a celebrity now,

            the most wanted,

            <i> top criminale.</i>

            What the...

            Out of gas.

            Can we walk
            to a gas station?

What you think?

Here, there's nothing,
nothing.

        What about that?

        I'm going over.

                What if they
                recognize me?

You careful,
no one will see you.

 You take<i> benzina</i>
 from the tractor.

            Yeah, but how?

<i> E' tanto difficile?</i>

You go to the tractor,
open tank,

and steal<i> benzina.</i>

                Great.

                    Come on!

    Hurry up!

    Come on!

                Eh!

    Nonna-napper?
    Nonna-napper is kidnapper?

No. No, no, no.

It's just about
telling a story.

        What did you tell them?

Nothing.

        Well, she's describing
        Summer as if--

        as if she's, like,
        this dangerous criminal,

        and your mother
        is, like,

    "Oh, she's
    this helpless woman

    who was tragically
    stolen against her will."

At this rate, Summer will
rot in an Italian jail
for years.

        Heh. If we don't
        find them in time,

        she will rot
        in an American jail.

        Same deal, worse food.

Oh, ha ha.

Yeah, make a joke.
It's hilarious.

You don't seem
to get it!

Your mother is as much
a part of this as Summer!

She has manipulated
this whole thing.

            Oh, my mother?

Yes, your mother...
            My mother.

is one serious bitch,

and she
always has been.

            Don't say that--

It's true.

It's true.

It's true.

            Valentina.

            <i> SÃ¬, pronto.</i>

        ...Marcellino Gaspari.

You're not gonna
believe this.

My mother thinks
she's getting married
today at 3:00.

            What? To who?

There was a man
who filled her head

with a lot of nonsense
when she was young.

He got her
to run away from home,

and now he's
after her again.

She must have been
totally brainwashed.

            Oh, I think
            she knows exactly
            what she's doing.

            Do you know where?

No, I don't know.
In Rome,

but Valentina's
trying to find out more.

            What time is it?

Almost 2:00.

<i> E' impossibile</i>

        I'm so sorry, Carmen.

Marcellino,
what he think?

<i> Non lo so.</i>

<i> Che fortuna.</i>

        I'm gonna get this guy
        to stop, no matter what.

Good. Show leg.

        Show my leg?
Yes.

        Is that
        a cultural thing?

Sexual,
cross-cultural,
cross--

        I think
        my natural charms
        will be enough.

        Hey! Stop!

<i> Mamma mia.</i>

        What? What?! No.

        And now what?

        I supposed
        to let a greasy farmer
        feel me up?

            <i> Ciao.</i>

Sorry about
the, uh, "Whoo."

Actually,
it was her idea.

            Don't apologize.

            I liked it.

<i> Salve.</i>
                    <i> Salve.</i>

And you are
the mother of...

Summer Falk.
                Yes.

The same woman
featured in the news
as a Nonna-napper?

        Well,
        that's not accurate.

But she did take
this man's car
without his consent,

and at the same time,

she kidnapped his mother.

        Well, no. No, she wanted
        to be kidnapped.

        No, I mean,
        she didn't want to be--

        She didn't want
        to be kidnapped,

        but she's been
        trying to get--

It says here that she
claimed to be a kidnapper
at the airport.

            What?

            No. No, no, no,
            no, no, no.

No.

            I said
            I kidnapped her.

Oh, you kidnapped her.

        Yes. No, no, no.

        I mean,
        I didn't kidnap her.

        I was saying it,
        like, as a--

        you know,
        just as a joke.

         You know, as a joke.
         You know, like--

As a joke.

            It's funny.
            Like ha ha ha.

Can you please
provide her physical
characteristics, please?

            Sure. Sure. Um...

            she's, um--
            She's 5'3",

             and, um,
             she has blue eyes.

        Uh, she has
        a couple of piercings.

        I mean,
        they're very minor,

        not as bad as it sounds.

        Um, and, uh...

        she has a tattoo.

A tattoo?

            One or two,

            but they're
            very innocuous
            thematically.

            You know,
            she has a--

            It's, like--
            She has a butterfly,

            and she has
            a cute little...

            skull.

Yeah.
            I mean, it's--

            They're teenagers,

            so you--What are
            you gonna do?

Yeah.
Uh, criminal records?

            Well, um,
            it's a little bit
            of a gray area,

            I mean,
            legally speaking,
            'cause she's not a--

At the airport,
she claimed to have
no criminal past.

        Look, are you
        going to help me?

Criminal records, please.

                Um...

            all right,
            there were
            these rabbits.

    Rabbits?

            Yes, and they needed
            to be liberated.

         Hello.

Maggie.
  Hello.

            The marriage will be

            at the Chiesa
            Santa Caterina
            dei Funari.

        OK.
            Tell Luca.

            He must hurry.
        Yeah.

<i> Grazie.</i>

Chiesa Santa Caterina
dei Funari.

            Maggie!

            Look. Roma.

Wow.

        Perfect hiding place
        for the kidnapper
        of<i> la nonna,</i> right?

What?
            Relax.

            I admire you.

    You do?

                    Yeah.

        You know
        those farmer dudes
        with the chickens?

        They are my neighbors.

        I run an ecological farm
        in the next valley,

        but those men,
        they are assholes,

        treat their chickens
        like shit.

        I'm glad
        you liberated them.

Actually, it wasn't
planned this time.

We just needed some gas
so we could get to Rome.

She's got a hot date
at some<i> chiesa,</i> you know?

But I guess, in a way,

you could say
that's a higher purpose.

        And what about you?

            You also have
            a hot date?

    No.

    I...

kinda got a boyfriend
back home, but...

                    Too bad.

        Here we are.

Do you--

Are you on Facebook,
by any chance?

            I'll find you.

Hey, Rome, huh?

            Let's do
            as the Romans don't.

            I know I will.

            Do you know
            your way around?

<i> SÃ¬, sÃ¬.</i>
 It's not so far.

        That's great.
        Marcellino will be
        so buzzed to see you.

Tyler will be buzzed,
too, no?

                    Yeah.

            Now I guess
            I'll go find

            an airport bus
            or something.

        Come on.
        Let's get out of here.

    Oh,<i> scusi. Scusi.</i>

    Uh, Chiesa--

    Chiesa Santa Caterina?

    It's a church.

    Excuse me.
    Chiesa Santa Cat--

    Thanks.
    Santa Caterina?

    Oh, um,<i> dove--</i>

    uh, you know where,

    uh, Chiesa Santa Caterina
    dei Funari--

    Chiesa--It's a church.

    This way?

    Ah,<i> grazie, grazie.</i>

    <i> Uh, molto bella, grazie.</i>

Don't worry
   about it, lady.

Oh, thank you.

            Hello.

Maggie.

                Maggie.

    <i> Dove?</i> OK.

                    <i> SÃ¬.</i>

            Giulia.

OK.

        <i> A la Santa Caterina</i>
        <i> dei Funari.</i>

                    Come on.

                Is this it?

    OK. Eh?

                    Yeah.
    Yes?

            Is it OK if I
            come with you?

    Here.

                Marcellino.

Carmen.

Oh, Carmen.

<i> Mamma mia.</i>

        <i> Cari amati...</i>

                    Summer!

Mom?

            Sorry. I'm sorry.

Sorry.

            Hi. Ah, honey.
What are you doing?

You're totally screwing up
this beautiful thing.

        Listen to me.
        You listen to me, OK?

        The police are coming,
        but it's OK.

        I'm gonna fix
        everything, all right?
Fix what?

        I need you
        to come with me now.

No, Mom,
I am not leaving.

        Summer, you have
        to come with me.

Do you know what I've
been through to get here?

<i> Siamo qui riuniti</i>
<i> alla presenza di Dio...</i>

            Summer,
            come on, sweetie.

No. Stop it.
            We have to go.

            Seriously, you have
            to come with me now.
            I'm serious.

I'm not moving.

Seriously?

        <i> No, Luca. No. No, no.</i>

<i> PapÃ ?</i>

Carmen.

Carmen. Carmen.

            <i> Chiami</i>
            <i> un'ambulanza.</i>

    <i> No, no, no.</i>

Summer Falk,
   you're under arrest.

        No. No, no, no.
        You can't do this.

Yes, we can, madam.

        'Cause your daughter
        has stolen a car,

        kidnapped
        a defenseless old--

No, she didn't kidnap--

        She's driven without
        a valid driving license.

         She forged
         your signature

        and caused damage
        to a hire car,

        stolen gasoline,
        broken a fence,
        released chickens,

        and caused what
        could have developed...

For crying out loud.
        into a major fire

        if the firemen hadn't
        come very quickly.

        And all of the above
        in less than 24 hours.

Summer, Summer, Summer.

    Stop, no! Mom!
                No, no, no.

        Can't just take her.
        I have to be with her.

        What are you doing?
        Where are you
        taking her?

         I don't even know
         where you're
         taking her.

                To the police
                station, madam.

            Hey, gentle! Gentle!

            Stop it! Don't be
            so rough with her!

            She's not
            a hardened criminal.
            What are you doing?

There will be a hearing
tomorrow morning at 9:00
at the police station.

That will be
your opportunity
to state your case.

<i> - Arrivederci. </i>
  Mom.

            Honey, I'm coming,
            OK? I'll be
            right there.

            I'll be right there.
            I'll be--

    Hey.

I'm sorry.

Maybe things got
a little out of hand.

        W-Why are you sorry?

        You got your story.
        That's what you wanted,
        wasn't it?

I wanted to help you.

            Luca. You wanted
            to help Luca.

Call me if there's
anything I can do for you.

Please.

                    Hi.

Candy and Marcel. Heh.

The way we were.

    It would
    have been so cool

    just to have had
    one more chance,
    you know?

        Uh, she's in
        room 103.

                This one.
                Thank you.

                <i> Grazie.</i> Thanks.

<i> SÃ¬.</i>

    Maggie.

                    Hey.
    Hi.

        I wanted to see
        how Carmen was, and--

She was lucky.

She has a mild concussion

from when she fell
and hit her head
on the floor.

She's recovering well.

        Oh, my God, I'm glad.
        I'm so glad.

            I really wanted
            to apologize

            for being
            so selfish.

What should I expect
from a woman

who just runs away
when it suits her?

It was the same
back then.

You just...

packed your bags and left.

You act unilaterally.

 You cut off communication.

That's fine. Heh.

 The message is clear,
<i> chiaro.</i>

            But, Luca,
            back then, I--

    What?

            I thought
            you would forget it.

    Sure.

Just because I...

I tell every girl I meet
that I love her?

Don't worry about it.

I'm fine.
My mother is fine.

 My daughter is fine.

                Daughter?

                    Oh.

                    So OK.

Goodbye, Maggie.

Giulia Carni.

    Giulia, it's Maggie Falk.

Giulia.

                Oh.

Look, I've told you
I'm so sorry.

        No, you said every story

        can be viewed
        from different angles,

        and I would
        like to give you
        another opportunity.

What is this all about?

            Well, if you
            will listen,
            I will tell you.

    OK.

I suppose I owe you that.

But I need a drink first.

<i> Ragazzo,</i>
<i> martini per favore.</i>

            Thank you
            for helping me.

            I was concerned
            you might...

        have a negative attitude
        because of him, Luca.

Luca? No.

I gave him up
long time ago.

Too hard to get.

Well, we dated some...

but there was always
someone else in the way...

some woman
a long, long time ago

who he couldn't forget.

I think
she was American.

I wish the two of you
all luck.

    ...comprising 17 infractions

    to be sentenced
    under the juvenile court

    with the expected outcome
    of a significant fine,

        criminal record,
        and proceeding
        for deportation.

    I'm--

I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry I'm late.

            Mom, where were you?
Sorry, honey.

    Oh, yeah, that's all right.
    We'll soon be finished here.

    Since your daughter
    is a minor,

    you'll be called
    to a separate meeting
    with social services,

    um, so we can go through
    details and--

        and, uh, discuss--

        I'm sorry.
        I have to take this.

        <i> Pronto, Comandante.</i>

        <i> SÃ¬. SÃ¬--</i>

        <i> Scusi?</i>

        <i> Grazie. Grazie.</i>

            Â¶ Mmm Â¶

    Â¶ I know I'm gonna make it Â¶

Â¶ ...and look at the sun Â¶

Â¶ See your life
from the other side Â¶

Â¶ Watch the world
passing by Â¶

Â¶ Grab a seat in the sky Â¶

Â¶ Grab a ride,
grab a ride in the sky Â¶

    Â¶ 'Cause all roads Â¶

Â¶ All roads lead to Rome... Â¶

        Wow, Mom,
        that was amazing.

        How'd you get her
        to go along with you?

Oh, I appealed
to her sense of...

journalistic sisterhood.

        Well, you journalized
        the hell out of it.

Did I?
            Totally.

        You were like, "I came,
        I saw, I crushed."

        You were Caesar.

Wow. If you say so.

        You were
        like the mother
        of all Caesars.

         You really--
         a Caesarian section.

        You operated.
        You liberated Caesar
        from your womb.

Oh, I did.

    Mmm.

I liberated
my little rabbit.

        Don't call me that.

Well, it's true.

You're free.

And when I say free,

I mean free.

        You mean I can do
        whatever I want and
        call Tyler free?

I am backing you 100%.

        Even if I drive
        off a cliff?

Yes.
I mean, not physically.

        In that case,

        can I borrow your phone?

I'm getting you
a new one.

            Thanks.

        Tyler?

            Summer. Heh.

            Baby, yo,
            how'd it go?

            Um, are you--Are you
            cool to head back?

Yeah. I can do
whatever I want.

            That is awesome.
So that's settled.

It turns out I'm not going
to be able to help you.

            But you promised.

I did,

but I'm breaking
that promise,

'cause I realized
you have no honor.

                    Honor?

Yeah, honor,

an apparently outmoded
patriarchal concept
that I'm--

                    I'm...

    That I'm--
    I'm reappropriating
    as a nongender term

    for the furtherance
    of individual
    responsibility.

            Can you just
            tell him that?

    No, no. It's better
    coming from you.

            What I mean is,

        Tyler, you're a dick.

            What are you
            gonna do now?

            Go back
            to Uncle George's
            cottage?

Nah, nah, nah.
We're gonna stay in Rome
for a few days,

'cause there's
something that I promised
to make right.

                Hmm.

        <i> Grazie.</i>

        OK.

                Hey.

        <i> Grazie.</i>

    Hi.

            You're right.

            I do cut people off
            when I'm scared.

Maggie, I--
            I wish--

            I wish I had been
            straight with you.

            I wish I had stayed

            instead of
            running away.

Yeah, but--
                You don't have
                to explain.

            Honestly, it
            doesn't matter now.

            I just came
            because I want

            to return the favor
            you did me when you
            opened my eyes,

            because your mother
            is genuinely

            very much in love
            with that man,

            and she is
            gonna do what she
            wants to do

            with or without
            your say-so.

                So...

                say so.

        Maybe.

        I don't know.

            By the way, how old
            is your daughter?

        23.

            So you already
            had her back then.

            I mean
            when we were...

            when we
            were together.

        Why didn't you tell me?

Would you have gone
with a divorced guy

 with a young daughter?

        I'm gonna take that
        as rhetorical.

        Hey.

    Could you...

    accept one now?

        See how you feel
        about that thought
        in 20 minutes' time.

What?

Where are you going?

            Shh.

    Oh.

Did you arrange this?

        A woman takes
        what she wants

        when she wants it,
        right, Carmen?

<i> Marcellino e Carmen...</i>

    <i> SÃ¬.</i>
                    <i> SÃ¬.</i>

<i> SÃ¬.</i>

<i> SÃ¬.</i>

            <i> A la mia</i>
            <i> bellissima sposa.</i>

                <i> Sposa.</i> Hey!

            She looks so happy.

        I think you're
        gonna have to
        get used to that.

        And this as well.

            Maybe.

    Hmm.

I think, with the use
of all my strength...

I think I'll manage.
