"When I have fears

"To think, to love,

WOMAN [LAUGHS]: Oh!
Oh, nice.

Youâ€™re gonna be
a ravishing bride, Fran.

Let me guess.

Diane!

Theyâ€™ll go great
with that red dress

youâ€™re getting married in.
Oh, no.

Not me. I want
every ounce of tradition.

Marching down that aisle.

Everyone gasping,
"isnâ€™t she spectacular?"

And then Mark lifts my veil,

and he gazes into my eyes
for a long moment.

It better be long.
DIANE: Mmm.

Iâ€™ve dreamt about it
ever since I was a child.

Oh, yes.
And then the nightmare begins.

Oh, Nancy.
Donâ€™t listen to her.

Marriage is beautiful.

Keeps the dew fresh
on your eyelids.

Maggie teaches poetry,
she doesnâ€™t write it.

Marriage gives you
a point of view of balance.

The lens you see things
through thatâ€™s important.

Well, Iâ€™ve had a problem
with 20-20 vision

with both
of my husbands.

Hey, this is a bridal shower,
not group therapy.

Just one bit of advice, Fran.

IN UNISON: Oh, no!
Oh, no. This is vital.

Whatever you do,
have your own bathroom.

I mean, there are some things
you just donâ€™t wanna see him do.

Ugh.

A toast, to Fran.

FRAN: Mm, okay.
Yes.

[MAGGIE SIGHS]

Happiness forever.

MAGGIE:
To a man whoâ€™s your soul mate.

Fresh dew on your eyelids.
Hmm.

BOTH:
And your own bathroom.

Oh.
Oh.

Oh, Iâ€™m sorry. Oh, God.
NANCY: Here, here.

Oh, today of all days.
Here.

Oh.

FRAN: Oh, here, here.
Iâ€™m sorry.

Mom, hey, Mom. Wait up.

Can I borrow the car?

Oh, sorry.

Home to change.
Betrayed again by chocolate.

You look fine.
I do not look fine.

I have a meeting
with curriculum committee

in, uh,
47 minutes.

Iâ€™m not gonna give them
the chance to say no.

Now where are my keys?

Hey, do you have the list?

Your anniversary party,
who you and Dad want to invite.

Oh please, Diane, you donâ€™t
need to give us a party.

Itâ€™s just too expensive.

Well,
why wait tables

if I canâ€™t squander
the money on my parents?

Because you have student loans
and books.

Mom, your 25th
anniversary is a major.

How many of your friends
are you inviting?

I wanna celebrate
you and Dad.

Oh, listen,
your father and I

are probably gonna go
to Bermuda, have a little sex.

MAGGIE:
So touching.

I think theyâ€™re
filthy perverts.

When can I
have the car?

Five oâ€™clock.
Okay.

Hey, and get that
list together!

Key experience could be thought
of as intricate collages,

crafted from
fragments of the past.

But even more
relevant today.

Particularly his view
of romantic love.

[INAUDIBLE CHATTERING]


[CAR DOORS CLOSE]

TOM:
Howâ€™s that list
coming for Diane?

Sheâ€™s inviting everybody
weâ€™ve ever met.

Pretty impressive.

Not too sure about
the Harrisons, though,

heâ€™s such a jerk.

So howâ€™s that
list coming?

Hmm?

Iâ€™m sorry,
muffin.

Did the meeting
go badly?

It went
splendidly.

Theyâ€™re very enthusiastic
about poetry.

Particularly Keats.

Terrific.

Howâ€™s about a nice,
big Caesar salad?

Lots of anchovies.

Iâ€™m starving.

You feel like
a Caesar salad?

TOM:
Yeah.

Is that what
you want?


Go on playing house?

What?

Bridgette. Bridgette.

Isnâ€™t that her name?
Your new paralegal.

I recognized those
ridiculously long legs.

What are you
talking about?

I saw you,
Tom.

I planted those gardenias
that you gave to her.

Iâ€™m sorry,
Mags.

Thatâ€™s it?

Thatâ€™s all you
have to say?

It just happened.

Here? In our house?

Which room did it
happen in, Tom?

Letâ€™s cool it,
okay?

For 25 years, I have
come home to you.

Was it so difficult?

Iâ€™m the one who dropped out
of college to work

so you could go
to law school.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

Oh, donâ€™t answer that phone.
Turn off the phone.

What do you
want me to say?

Is there anything I can
say thatâ€™ll make it okay?

I donâ€™t know. I want you to
say that I didnâ€™t see right.

What happened?

I fell in love.

Oh, my God.

MAGGIE:
Happiness forever.

With a man
whoâ€™s your soul mate.

Fresh dew
on your eyelids.

And your
own bathroom.

After years of controversy,

during which John Keatsâ€™
work had been,

alternately,
savagely criticized,

and extravagantly praised,

and then finally,
neglected.

[BELL RINGS]

His position as one of Englandâ€™s
finest poets has been confirmed.

Have a great summer
everybody.

[STUDENTS CLAPPING]

[STUDENTS CHATTERING]

Oh, Mrs. Weber.
Yes.

Listening to you talk
about Keats

with such passion
this semester,

well,
would you read this?

Oh, sure, Jennifer.

Itâ€™s beautiful,
Jennifer.

You have
real talent.

Did you
know that?

Really?

Well, thank you.

You gave me the
courage to write it.

Have a great summer,
Mrs. W.

Thanks.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh, hey,
Jim Rogers.

Just trying to be a gentleman.

What a relief.

Chivalryâ€™s not dead.

And Iâ€™m looking forward
to these, uh, weeks off.

You?

Um, yeah, sort of.

Itâ€™s been an unusual
three months.

I know.
Thanks.

Uh, do you like
The Stones?

Keith Richards, Charlie Watts,
the guy with the lips.

Um, yes.

I thought you
would.

Third row.

Theyâ€™re gonna be here
on the 26th.

Been to every Stones concert
around here since 1972.

Oh, fantastic.

And would you, uh,
like to go with me?

Um...

Thank you,
but...

Okay.

Everybody knows how
devoted Jim Rogers was

throughout
his wifeâ€™s cancer.

I mean, come on,
heâ€™s a damn jewel.

Would you just
lay off me?

Everyone has
a solution.

Then help yourself.

I was married
for 25 years.

I slept next to someone
I thought I knew,

every night
for 25 years.

And, suddenly,
itâ€™s over!

What am I
supposed to do?

Just shake myself
and just snap to?

Yes, exactly.
Oh, God.

Come on.
Tom isnâ€™t worth it, Maggie.

Oh, just...
Would you just knock it off?

Franâ€™s husband knows
a lawyer in Tomâ€™s firm.

And he says that
Tom was well-known

for dipping into
the paralegal pool.

Maggie, this was not
the first time.

[CLOCK TICKING]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

NANCY:
Youâ€™re going to take
a sabbatical?

Why didnâ€™t
you tell us?

I just decided
yesterday.

Maggie, you
are so secretive.

No, Maggieâ€™s
just private.

So where are you going?
Up north.

To an unbelievably beautiful
spot called Little Bear Lake.

Little Bear Lake?

Yeah, thereâ€™s a restaurant,
a dance hall there

where I spent one of the
happiest summers of my life.

I was eighteen,
waiting tables.

I want to go back there
and find that girl.

You havenâ€™t been in touch

with anybody up there
all this time?

No.

Thereâ€™s one person,
though, in particular,

Iâ€™ve always
wondered about.

A male person?

Patrick Fleming.

He was... Oh, God,
he was my first love.

Handsome and gentle.
Hmm?

No. I was too young.

But it didnâ€™t stop me
from wanting him.

Didnâ€™t take a breath that summer
without thinking of Patrick.

That is romantic.

I found his letters.

I havenâ€™t a clue
what happened to him.

Youâ€™re not going up there
because of this Patrick guy,

hoping you
and he might...?

No, Iâ€™m going
up there

because I want
to sort out my life.

And I wanna see
the old dance hall again.

Patrick and I
had this secret place.

It was a dock
that he had built.

And we used to go there and
recite poetry to one another.

Does that sound
hopelessly sappy?

No.

No, it wasnâ€™t.
It was... It was perfect.

What happened?
I ended it.

Iâ€™m worried about
your expectations, Mom.

This guyâ€™s probably
married with 10 kids.

Iâ€™m not
expecting him

to be waiting for me
on our dock.

I just donâ€™t want you
to be hurt anymore, okay?

Itâ€™s enough Dadâ€™s living
with Bridgette so soon,

that bastard.

Donâ€™t you ever call
your father a bastard.

Iâ€™m okay.

Iâ€™m better than okay.
Iâ€™m excited.

You gonna be
okay?

I love you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[DOOR OPENS]

MAN:
What are you doing here, lady?

[DOOR CLOSES]

Oh, Iâ€™m just looking
for the owner.

I canâ€™t hear what youâ€™re saying.
My batteries are low.

Youâ€™re breaking the law,
you know, youâ€™re trespassing.

I saw you from my place.
Iâ€™m just looking around.

Um, how long has
this place been closed?

A few years.

Come on,
youâ€™ve gotta go.

Mr. Finnegan.

Gil?
What?

Itâ€™s so nice
to see you again.

Maggie Patterson.
I used to work here.

How is Harriet?

Same as sheâ€™s
always been.

Who are you?

Maggie!

Oh, yes.

Those blue eyes.
You donâ€™t forget.

Youâ€™re the one who
couldnâ€™t balance your tray.

Well, a few beer bottles
did hit the deck.

What a coincidence.

An old friend of yours
just came up here too.

Someone you were
very close with.

Oh, who was that?

Our daughter,
Claire.

Oh.

Great.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I thoroughly enjoyed
each marriage.

Until the crash landing.

Oh, theyâ€™re tough.

Very.

But you just have to get
back up on the horse.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Oh, I, um,
I grabbed this.

Oh, wait.
Out of a box of old memories.

This is gonna
take you back.

How unafraid
we were.

We really believed we could
do anything, didnâ€™t we?

Oh, yes. Remember how
passionate we were?

Oh.

We were gonna
stop the bombing.

End the war, bring
the troops back home.

And we did it.

Oh, how we used to
argue for hours

over every
conceivable topic.

Patrick was...
He was good at that.

He was good
at everything.

Well, to survival.
Right.

And old friends.

Uhm.

Somehow I always knew,

even after you didnâ€™t
come back that summer

and we never
heard from you.

Still, I just knew
Iâ€™d see you again.

Well, I wrote
to Patrick after.

I told him why I couldnâ€™t
come back to the Harvest Moon.

Didnâ€™t he ever talk
about me?

Uh-hmm.
He wouldnâ€™t.

My father was sick.

My mother had
just died.

He was in such
a panic

that if I came back
here to Patrick,

I would never go
home again.

I devoted all my time
to my dad.

It just...
It just took me over.

When I wrote to Patrick,
I asked him

if it wouldnâ€™t be better
if we broke up.

And he never responded.
He never wrote back.

Itâ€™s important to me that
I straighten things out.

I want to tell him
Iâ€™m sorry for what I...

For what I did
and for what I didnâ€™t do.

But Maggie...

Heâ€™s married with 10 kids.
I know, I know.

Well, after that summer,
he did marry a girl

that he met over
in Twin Falls.

She was pregnant.

Is he still with her?

Patrickâ€™s dead.

Heart attack.

Quite a few years ago.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Iâ€™m so sorry.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

HARRIET:
Reopen The Moon?

Itâ€™s more decrepit
than we are.

Speak
for yourself.

Oh,
put that out.

I wanna open The Moon
and fix it up.

So it gleams
the way it used to.

And rocks with music
and life and fun.

And I wanna open
in eight weeks,

on the night of the
actual Harvest Moon.

Itâ€™s the most romantic
night of the year.

It wonâ€™t work.
The Moonâ€™s up for sale.

If we
open it again,

weâ€™ll be right down there
working with you.

Iâ€™ll buy it then.

I approve, I approve.

Just borrowing money
for a dance hall?

Iâ€™ve never let myself go.
Iâ€™ve always wanted to and I...

Iâ€™ve never
listened to myself.

This is my chance
to move forward.

DIANE:
I hear you, Mom.

Iâ€™m sorry about that man,
Patrick.

Must have been
a bummer.

Iâ€™m gonna try
and put him to rest.

Financial statements.

Uh, list all your assets,

bank accounts, real estate,
stocks, cars, boats.

And, uh, since youâ€™re
on sabbatical

with only half your income,
Mrs. Weber,

we do require
a, uh, co-signer

who, in effect, will guarantee
the loan in case of default.

Have any idea who you might
get to co-sign for you?

I have several
possibilities.

Mr. Stanton.
Paul.

MAGGIE:
Oh, right.
If I fill this in now,

when am I gonna
get the loan?

Um, if everythingâ€™s in order,
six to eight weeks.

No! I have to
open in eight weeks.

I have to get the word out
that The Moon is open

for the rest of
the year.

And we want to open on the night
of the actual Harvest Moon.

Itâ€™s eight weeks.

Well...

Well, we have to be sensitive
to your calendar, donâ€™t we?

I mean,
being the friendly bank.

Iâ€™ll tell you what.

If you can get a
co-signer right away,

I will guarantee
the loan.

And you can get started
on these repairs.

Well, I have
some savings back home.

And Harriet says
that I can stay upstairs

at the Moon for
a while, so...

Ah.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hi.

Hi.

Are you... You lost?

MAGGIE:
No.

Um,
I know this area.

Iâ€™m just
wandering about.

MAGGIE:
Excuse me. Is this your dock?

No. But, uh...

Actually,
my father built it.

A long time ago.

Who was your father?

MAN:
Patrick Fleming.

Iâ€™m John Fleming.

Hi, Iâ€™m Maggie.

Hi, Maggie.

Are you sure I canâ€™t
help you with anything?

No.

Iâ€™m staying
up the hill.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Diane told me about
this dance hall thing.

Is this your way
of getting back at me?

You really do think everything
is about you, donâ€™t you?

Iâ€™m sorry, but you must
be getting in touch

with some long hidden part
of your inner psyche,

but itâ€™s way beyond anything
reasonable or responsible.

That is a little odd
coming from you.

What do you know about
running a dance hall?

Look, Iâ€™m not asking you
for your stamp of approval.

I just need you to
co-sign the loan.

Thereâ€™s some money
in the house, my share.

Yeah, but you wonâ€™t put
the house on the market.

Itâ€™s not worth anything
if we donâ€™t sell it.

Iâ€™m not ready to
sell my house.

Our house.
Our house.

This means
a lot to me.

I would appreciate
your help.

Look, uh, Iâ€™ve got
an early meeting...

No, no, no,
Tom!

It canâ€™t wait.

Put the house
on the market.

Well now youâ€™re
making some sense.

Look, you send me the facts
on this dance hall thing

and Iâ€™ll consider
co-signing the loan

after we sell
the house.

Go to hell!

Just you go to hell!

Listen, everybody,
this is the great woman

whoâ€™s opening
the Harvest Moon again.

No, no!
We hope! We hope!

We hope! We hope!

Hi.

Does that mean
weâ€™ve got the loan?

I canâ€™t take
rejection.

Never could.
Right.

I think it was
just a wave.

I called him.

Told him I didnâ€™t have
a co-signer.

He wasnâ€™t thrilled.
Oh, bummer.

Well...

I got them.

Is that
Johnâ€™s wife?

On the verge,
I hear.

[WHISTLE BLOWS]

Letâ€™s hear it for
the goalie, huh?

Nine saves!

[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]

MAN:
What you got
cooking there?

[LEAVES RUSTLING]

Mrs. Weber?

Oh, call me Maggie.
Great, Maggie.

Um, so you donâ€™t go through
the weekend in suspense.

Oh, God.
What?

Weâ€™re gonna give you the
loan on the Harvest Moon.

Without a co-signer?
Yes.

Itâ€™s irregular but, uh,
we want the Moon to reopen.

Itâ€™s a big deal
around here.

It used to be called the
Treasure of Little Bear Lake.

Thank you! Thank you!

Iâ€™m gonna try and make it
an even greater treasure.

Sure you will.
Listen,

weâ€™re delighted
to have you here.

Uh, yeah.
Thank you.

Appreciate it.
Youâ€™re welcome.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

JOHN:
Maggie? Hi.

Youâ€™re Maggie Patterson, right?
John Fleming.

I hear youâ€™re gonna
reopen The Moon.

Yes.

Well, Iâ€™m sort of
a jack of all trades.

You can ask anyone.

And, uh,
I carve wood too.

Although itâ€™s kind of hard
to make a living out of that.

If youâ€™re hiring,
Iâ€™ll work very hard for you.

I figure whatever you need,
I can get it for you.

I know everybody
in town.

Iâ€™m not gonna let anyone put
their hand in your pocket.

I know your father
was the architect

who restored
the Moon in the â€™70s.

God, I always wondered

what he was like
when he was younger.

I know he was completely
into his work.

â€™Cause I get that
from him.

Although he could be
a little grandiose at times.

Grandiose?
Oh, yeah.

John Keats Fleming.

He named me after
the poet.

Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s
pretty grandiose.

Gives you something
to live up to.

Named after a poet.
Yeah.

I try not to be
too intimidated though.

So you gonna take
a chance on me?

Sign me on
as your foreman.

Iâ€™ll give it
a try.

See you
Monday morning.

Early.

Thank you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[WORKERS HAMMERING]

MAN:
Itâ€™s almost over.

[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]

Oh, my God!

HARRIET:
Maggie!

We have to admit, weâ€™re excited
about whatâ€™s going on here!

Weâ€™d like to
offer our services.

And it wonâ€™t cost
you a cent.

Advice, chores,
hand-holding.

Oh, we just
canâ€™t stay away.

Well, this is an offer
I canâ€™t resist.

CLAIRE: Maggie!
Thank you.

Maggie!
Yeah.

Can I speak with you
for a minute, please?

Madam?

These, um...

These records that you asked
me to order for the jukebox?

Some Enchanted Evening?
Light My Fire? You Send Me?

What about
them?

These were Patrickâ€™s
favorites, werenâ€™t they?

Well, why tear
yourself up?

Going back to Patrick
and the past...

Well...

Look at that list.
Thereâ€™s current ones.

Maggie, come on.

Well, part of the reason
for me coming up here,

this whole journey was just
to reconnect with a happy time.

Come out refreshed
and with my head together.

Hey, good. I just
hope that all this work

is building something
for your future,

not getting you stuck
in the past.

Ladies, I found a great buy on
lilies for the front entrance.

My dad had this picture
of the place years ago

with all these lilies out
in front and it was great.

I almost forgot.
You have to decide

whether you want to
paint the dance floor

or if you want stain
and seal coats.

Oh, well, just check it
with Claire.

Eighty dollars for this ad.
Itâ€™s ridiculous.

Let me see.

We should be putting posters up
on telephone poles.

Well, people donâ€™t read
telephone poles.

Maybe John can
get it cheaper.

Well, you
ask him then.

Speaking of
your foreman,

Maggie, he thinks
youâ€™re avoiding him.

And he keeps
asking me why.

Heâ€™s uncomfortable.

Well, I donâ€™t know
what to do. I...

I see him and
I think of Patrick,

whom I loved
so much.

My first romance.

There John
is smiling at me,

telling me a section of the roof
has got dry rot and I...

Iâ€™m just
shivering inside.

It shakes me up.

Even his hands
are like Patrickâ€™s.

Same broad palms
and long fingers.

You could
get lost in them.

Am I supposed
to tell him that?

Sounds positively
pornographic.

Tell me.

Oh, Maggie,
he is not Patrick.

Heâ€™s nothing
like him.

And itâ€™s not nice,
the way youâ€™re treating him.

JOHN:
Maggie?

Iâ€™d like to
show you something.

Would you mind coming with me,
please?

Yep.

Youâ€™ve got people all excited
about the opening of The Moon.

I want it to be the
biggest event of the year.

I think this town needs
the Harvest Moon.

My dad used to
always go on

about how you could go down
there any night of the week

and youâ€™d always run
into your friends.

And in those days
everyone danced

and nobody cared whether they
looked cool or not.

They just let
themselves go. You know?

I think youâ€™re bringing
that back here.

You think people today
want the same things?

Yeah.

I do.

What do you think?
Oh, you fixed the sign.

Thatâ€™s the way it looked
in my dadâ€™s photo.

I remember.
Itâ€™s just the way it was

when I drove up in
my pale blue Plymouth.

Years ago,
for the first time.

I was so nervous.

I wanted to become part
of the whole thing here.

Well, well, I did.

After breaking 30 beer bottles,
I wasnâ€™t much of a waitress.

Iâ€™m amazed Harriet
didnâ€™t fire me.

Look, look.
Thereâ€™s a monarch.

Heâ€™ll probably
hibernate soon.

No, actually,

I think monarchs
are the only butterfly

that migrates thousands
of miles south in the winter.

All with these
delicate wings.

Ah.

Oh, thousands of miles.

God, how could anything
be so determined

and so fragile?

Itâ€™s like you.

Doing all of this.

Maggie, thereâ€™s been
an accident!

Oh my God!
What happened?

He fell off the roof.
Bring him in.

Iâ€™ll call the doctor.
We were putting the tarp up.

The doctor wants you observed
for at least three hours.

So you donâ€™t fall asleep
or lose consciousness.

I should go
home now.

No, you should be lying quietly.
I feel fine.

You should stay at least
one more hour, John.

JOHN:
Claire tells me
youâ€™re a teacher.

What do you teach?

English literature.

JOHN:
Literature. I like that word.

You know, itâ€™s just got
to be good for you.

I wasnâ€™t very
good in school.

Guess, I was more interested
in working with my hands.

Always liked books, though.
It was school that put me off.

Didnâ€™t your father
encourage you to read?

A Keats fan?
Oh, yeah.

He said that I would come to
it eventually, in my own time.

In my own way.

He was right,
of course.

I find myself reading
more and more.

What are some
of your favorite books?

Maybe  Crime and Punishment.

Or  Steppenwolf.

Thatâ€™s funny.
So many guys love that book.

Is that sarcasm?
No.

No, theyâ€™re both fine books,
really.

Recently I read
Wuthering Heights.

Unbelievably romantic.

The characters long
to be together for years.

But when she finally gets
her man, she dies.

In a sense,
she loves the wrong man.

How can you love
the wrong man?

I mean,
love is such a gift.

I think itâ€™s enough
just to love.

Donâ€™t you?
Oh.

I donâ€™t really have
a philosophy.

Not about love,
anyway.

I have sort of been
having a fantasy.

Sort of an exercise to get me
through a difficult phase.

I call it the
Cult of Aphrodite.

All the women
can have five lovers.

And all the men
must be monogamous.

Or they turn
into eunuchs.

Wow.

That must
be some phase.

Yeah.
It is some phase.

Facing that youâ€™re
a supporting player

in other peopleâ€™s lives
and not truly important.

I didnâ€™t...

I didnâ€™t thank you
for drying my boots off.

Iâ€™m gonna have to go
get them wet now.

Oh, there you are.
Oh, sweetie.

Thanks so much for
taking care of him.

JOHN:
Amy, I told you I was okay.

I could have
driven myself.

Honey, you
fell off a roof.

Come on, letâ€™s go.
Come on.

Thanks for
the first aid.

And donâ€™t worry,
weâ€™ll open The Moon on time.

Promise.
Goodnight.

Okay, thanks.
All right.

Uh, they say the Moonâ€™s
foundation is slipping.

Weâ€™re gonna have to reinforce it
with concrete and steel.

Well, then weâ€™ll do it.
We have three weeks.

Um, itâ€™s gonna
cost a lot.

That building has been
standing a hundred years.

We can refinance our place,
canâ€™t we, Gil?

Get some money
for this.

Mom, the little equity
you have in your house,

itâ€™s everything
youâ€™ve got.

Now I have some money coming
from my latest divorce.

Uh, but not for
a couple of months.

I could sell my house
back home, but...

itâ€™s not gonna
help us now.

You could
open later.

I was hoping I was gonna be
able to raise part of the money

and youâ€™d give me
a loan for the rest.

Iâ€™ve reached the bottom
of my piggy bank.

When you reach the bottom,
you wonder whatâ€™s gonna happen.

You wonder
stuff like...

"am I gonna have
a roof over my head?"

Am I gonna starve?
Am I gonna die?

You donâ€™t have to.
No, I know. I know. I know.

Iâ€™m not gonna die.

When you reach the bottom,
you... You just feel dead.

Because your dreams
are dying.

And Iâ€™m not gonna
let that happen.

I am not gonna
pull out.

Iâ€™m gonna open
The Moon,

even if people have to
come and dance on the grass

at the waterâ€™s edge, I am gonna
open The Harvest Moon.

[PHONE RINGS]

Maggie,

we believe
in this project.

Weâ€™re gonna give you
the extra 30,000 you need.

Oh, no. Itâ€™s 50.
Thirty.

Fifty!
Thirty, Maggie.

John Fleming came
in with the new figures.

He promised us he could do
the job, first class, for 30.

Now, we trust John.

You really are
the friendly bank.

Okay, whatâ€™s the matter?

Oh, that was a good sigh.

You know, you can sigh
when youâ€™re happy.

You can even cry
when youâ€™re happy.

Iâ€™ve always thought
that was amazing.

Come on,
letâ€™s celebrate.

No. Got work to do
for the next three days.

We... We must
celebrate you.

Maggie Patterson,
former teen waitress,

and this amazing
accomplishment.

Yes, it is, isnâ€™t it?
Yes.

Iâ€™m gonna send a copy
of this deed to my ex.

All right. To, um,
anger, revenge, spite.

No.
What?

To love.

That other stuffâ€™s good
for a while, but it buries you.

It makes you ugly.
All right.

To love.
To love.

Um, John,

what is your

Depends on my mood.

Oh-oh.

I have to go pick up

Half an hour ago.

So long.

Drive carefully.
CLAIRE: I will.

Iâ€™ve got a quarter.
What would you like to hear?

Um, itâ€™s getting

Iâ€™m gonna go upstairs,

No, no, no. Pick a song.

Um, no.
Iâ€™m...

Iâ€™m gonna go to bed,

[CLICKS AND COIN CLINGS]


[LATIN MUSIC PLAYS]

No.


We canâ€™t do this.

Itâ€™s wrong.

Oh, the workâ€™s
almost done.

We should stay away
from each other.

Just go.

I want you to go.

[LATIN MUSIC PLAYS CONTINUES]

[BIRDS CHIRPING]


CLAIRE:
Maggie.

Yeah?
Hey.

The plumbers
are waiting for John.

Where is he?

And where the devil
is my coffee?

You promised
to make six cups.

Yeah, I did make six cups.
I just drank it all.

Havenâ€™t slept
a wink all night.

Hey, what is this?
Some new religion?

Oh, itâ€™s
Patrickâ€™s letters.

What happened?

Something happened
last night.

Oh,
it could have.

I could have.

But I asked him to leave.
Oh.

Now, donâ€™t tell me
what a jerk I am.

Scared, repressed
Maggie.

You have any idea what
it feels like to wake up

and find yourself
captivated?

No.

Turned on by your
ex-loverâ€™s son.

Thatâ€™s pretty disgusting,
isnâ€™t it?

No!

A trifle out of
the ordinary, yes.

But, uh, normal, for a ripe,
red-blooded, divorcÃ©e.

Ripe?
Is that all it is?

Hey, hey. Donâ€™t knock it.
John reminds me of Patrick.

And transferring those feelings
to John is just wrong.

Iâ€™ve just got to put
out this torch.

Right.
Which torch?

The one for Patrick or
the one for John?

I donâ€™t know!

God!

Itâ€™s just
genetics.

I see John and I have
these feelings for him.

And then I dream
of Patrick.

What am I gonna do?
Tell me what to do.

I canâ€™t tell you
what to do.

Claire, Iâ€™m asking
you for advice.

Three ex-husbands?

Iâ€™m adviced out.

Nobody listens to me
anyway.

Ah, what the hell.

I think you
should take a look

at whatâ€™s really
going on with you.

And maybe give
yourself permission

to have a little fun,

instead of
torturing yourself

about whether itâ€™s
Patrick or itâ€™s John.

What do you
mean by that?

Your husband of
25 years dumped you.

Now you have got to
mourn that relationship.

From what youâ€™ve told me
about your ex,

John is completely
different.

For starters,
heâ€™s, uh...

Heâ€™s totally
into you.

And heâ€™s outgoing and
down to earth, connected.

And he seems to be running
away from sexy young things,

instead of after them.


Well, donâ€™t you
see that?

I see that my
job now

is to open this
wonderful dance hall

and make it the finest
Harvest Moon dance ever.

All right.
The plumbers await.

Come on.
Yes.

Hello?
DIANE:  Hey, Mom, itâ€™s me.

Hon.

DIANE:  Hi.
How are you?

Iâ€™m good. But Iâ€™m

be able to make it up
there for the opening.

Iâ€™ve got this biology paper
and you know

how I put everything off
until the last minute.

And it is
the last minute.

Iâ€™m sorry.
Really.

And, um, Mom?

What is it, hon?

DIANE:
Sheâ€™s pregnant.

Can you believe Dad?

Whoâ€™s pregnant?

DIANE:
Bridgette.

Dad has no conscience.
Itâ€™s so embarrassing.

Itâ€™s got nothing to

And what about you?

Oh, donâ€™t feel bad for me.
Iâ€™m...

Iâ€™m chilling,
as you would say.

Iâ€™m just sorry
you wonâ€™t be here.

But I completely
understand.

If you need me,
I will come.

Oh, Iâ€™ll save
you a dance.

Okay. Take care of yourself,

Maggie,
look at this.

[CLAIRE SIGHS]

These bows,
they are not making it.

Did we look this

[MAGGIE SCOFFS]

Probably.

Mm. Maybe...

Kind of like... No,
I think lose the bows.

Okay.
Thatâ€™s it, girls.

No bows and
what about their hair?

You know, up,
I suppose. No?

Hey, whereâ€™s John?

That tall grass in the front
has got to be cut.

Oh, it will be,
Pop.

Yeah. Uh, John is sending
some friends over to do it.

I spoke to him this morning,

And, uh,

heâ€™s not
feeling well.

You donâ€™t look so
good yourself.

Thanks.

Come on,

around here,

tomorrow nightâ€™s opening is
like, the nearest thing,

the soccer championship.

MAGGIE [ON TV]:
Well, I hope the Moon lives up
to peopleâ€™s memory of it.

Um, and more.

Weâ€™re gonna have a live band
as thereâ€™s a magic jukebox.

A song for everyone.
I believe that...

Sent in my deposit
for Design School today.

...that loving good songs
improves your life. And...

[CLEARS THROAT]

I thought that might get
your attention.


John, we need to make
some decisions here.

Sounds like
you made yours.

Well, todayâ€™s the deadline
for the applications, you know?

Iâ€™m not moving
to Chicago.

I think
you know that.

Amy, I donâ€™t want
to leave the lake.

Donâ€™t want to
leave my friends.

We have five years
invested in us, John.

Five years.

Okay, fine.

Letâ€™s live together
here then.

Can we do that?
Can we make it more

than just weekends

and sometimes on Wednesdays
after a movie? I mean,

letâ€™s close the gap, here,
letâ€™s make some sort

of commitment
to each other.

I like things the
way they are.

You do?
Yeah.

Okay.

Do you really think
this is gonna be enough?

Pray people eat dinner
before they come.

Got his answering machine
for the third time.

I even went by his place
this morning. He wasnâ€™t there.

Well, he could at least return
your call. Weâ€™re opening

tonight. Gil insists the
fire screen be ready.

Hmm. My parents are so jazzed
about The Harvest Moon opening.

Well, so am I.

Listen, Maggie,

as soon as my money
comes through

from my most
recent divorce,

I want to invest.
Yes?

Iâ€™ll bartend and
stock your jukebox.

But also carry
wood and...

And just generally
work like a fiend.

I would love to be
your partner.

Yes!

Oh.

This is not advice,
just a statement.

John is crazy
about you.

Now,
unlike myself,

you have this appealing
guy in your future.

I donâ€™t think I want to
hear this advice.

Well, Iâ€™m going
to give it anyway.

Listen, my Aunt Myrtle
used to say:

"When tarts are passing,
take tarts."

Tarts? Is that
a metaphor for John?

Your torch.
Itâ€™s for John, isnâ€™t it?

Look, babe, you have returned
to the land of the living.

Donâ€™t let him
pass you by.

Do you realize
I have all my money,

my future and my dreams
tied up in The Harvest Moon?

John Keats Fleming, my foreman,
is not around, doesnâ€™t care.

And who needs that?

If he even tries to get
through that door tonight,

Iâ€™m gonna tell him to turn the
hell around and keep marching.

Screw your Aunt Myrtle.
Oh.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh, God!

Come on, Keats, I gotta go.
I gotta get up to Longville,

get Lilyâ€™s folks and get back
here for the dance tonight.


Youâ€™re going tonight, right?
No, I donâ€™t think so.

You worked these weeks
at The Moon, fixing it up,

and youâ€™re not going?
No, Iâ€™m not going.

That Miss Patterson
opening The Moon?

Lily thinks sheâ€™s pretty.
You think sheâ€™s sexy?

Iâ€™ve had fantasies
about her.

Oh, man.

Those blue eyes.
Built too.

I imagined she asked me
to stay late, fixing drinks.

She plays a little music,
get a little...

Enough!
All right?

Okay.

Hi, itâ€™s me, Tom.

Maggie, are
you ready for this?

Paul sat talking to
me most of the night.

He wants to take me
to breakfast.

Thatâ€™s great.

And I thought my chances
had all dried up.

No.
See? You never know.

I love you.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Your eyes are actually bluer
than the sky behind you.

Donâ€™t be
romantic now.

I want to be
with you...

like this...
forever.

Is that
too romantic?

Way too
romantic.

These last few days
I stayed away from you

to protect you.

I had to find out

what it
was between us.

If it was just
sexual chemistry.

But being away from you
made me crazy.

I couldnâ€™t think
of anything but you.

It took me over.

It was a full scale
invasion.

I call this...

an omelet.

But it might be
an anomaly to you.

Hmm. Hmm.

Hmm,
itâ€™s very good.

Really...

really tasty.

Hmm. Kind of unique.

Unique?

Spicy.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Hmm. Come on.

You know what?

I really want to show
you my house.

My father
designed it.

It was
his best work.

All wood and stone.

Terribly masculine.

Just natural wood
and carvings.

How did
you know that?

Oh, just from...

when your father
renovated The Moon.

He would have liked
what youâ€™re doing.

What weâ€™re doing.

John, I havenâ€™t been
straight with you.

I told you I...
I knew your father.

When I came here that summer,
I watched him build that dock.

I was very much in
love with him.

And he was
in love with me.

You had an affair
with my father?

No.

It was
a very innocent love.

You should have
told me.

Well, I was just
looking for the truth.

Truth?

And what
is the truth?

I didnâ€™t know
what you were to me.

You let me know
when you find out.

No,
I already know.

I donâ€™t see
any future in this,

with the past

and our
differences.

Donâ€™t you see?

I donâ€™t care
about the past.

Or the
differences.

Maggie,

Iâ€™m not gonna let something
that happened 30 years ago

take you away
from me.

Not when I
feel this way.

When I know
you feel this way.

I donâ€™t
know how I feel.

Yes, you do.

It may scare the hell
out of you,

but I couldnâ€™t feel this
if you didnâ€™t feel it too.

Come here. Come here.

CLAIRE:
Maggie! Maggie!
And John!

[DOOR CLOSES]

Hmm. Well, weâ€™re
a colossal hit.

The entire town is talking
about last night.

Mhm, whatâ€™s for breakfast?
Tarts?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh, this is lovely. This is
lovely.

Oh,
itâ€™s fascinating.

Oh, this
is hilarious.

The Harvest Moon,
ducks and...


MAGGIE:
Itâ€™s like silk.

Beautiful furniture.

Patrick had
wonderful taste.

I made these.

John.

They actually won
some awards in Chicago.

I was approached by
some decorators, but...

I decided thereâ€™s no way
I can work on commission.

Listen to peopleâ€™s complaints
all the time,

try to
meet deadlines.

Well, I donâ€™t
blame you.

Iâ€™m like my dad
that way.

He liked who he was
in this town.

He felt like he was
part of something.

I guess
Iâ€™m the same way.

Iâ€™ve never felt stuck
in this town.

Hm.

Amy didnâ€™t get it.

She didnâ€™t get me.

What is this?

Thatâ€™s me at 10.

You know...

Pretty cute.

Youâ€™re gonna get to meet
my mom tomorrow.

Sheâ€™s coming to
the game.

Itâ€™ll be all right.

Hey, look at me.

Trust me.

Claire?
Yes, Iâ€™m chilly.

Would you like
to share a blanket?

Oh, no,
Iâ€™m okay. Thanks.

Are you okay?

Yes, Iâ€™m okay.

You donâ€™t
look okay.

Really, I am.
Truly.

Oh, youâ€™re
spoiling me.

Donâ€™t stop.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

Listen, thereâ€™s a buzz
going around that, uh,

you and John were getting
chummy at the flower shop.

The eighth deadly sin,
buying flowers.

No, babe. No, flowers
are cool. Just...

be smart.

Iâ€™m in love.

Iâ€™m truly
in love.

Oh, honey.

No, you donâ€™t have
to worry about me.

He loves me.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]


Hello.

I know who
you are.

Iâ€™m Julia Fleming.

John thought that the three
of us might get together,

but I thought it would be more
honest if we spoke alone.

Sounds like storm
clouds to me.

Which I honestly donâ€™t want.
I hoped weâ€™d get along.

Good. But that isnâ€™t
the most important thing.

No, Iâ€™d say John is.

I do love your son.

And you loved
my husband too.

Patrick used to talk
about you a lot

at the beginning,
this Maggie Patterson.

And then one day he stopped
talking about you and...

I stopped being
so jealous.

You were just a first love
and he forgot about you.

Just as John will.

If you love my son,
you will end this thing.

I desperately want
to get along with you.

I know that would
please John.

Would you approve of this
if you were Johnâ€™s mother?

Iâ€™m not his mother.

You could be.

What about children?
You gonna deny him that?

Are you that
selfish?

I want John to have
whatever he wants.

Heâ€™s a man.
Heâ€™s not a little boy.

Heâ€™s capable of making up
his own mind.

Are you so angry

because Patrick didnâ€™t
return your letter?

Why donâ€™t you admit that you
had to have a piece of Patrick

because you couldnâ€™t
have him before?

He forgot about you
and turned to me.

And you are using John
and that is cruel.

Even if Patrick
hadnâ€™t existed,

Iâ€™d feel the same way
about John.

I want to give him
something.

If you really
love John,

then you will
leave him alone.

What kind of a future
would he have with you?

MAN: Get him up there. Yeah!
Yes!

[PHONE RINGS]

You should be
celebrating with me.

The perceptive part of me
is guessing youâ€™re not out here,

pondering my
game-winning goal.

I have some things
to say to you.

My mother was way
out of line, okay?

We had it out.
She went home.

What we have
isnâ€™t right.

All of this because
of what my mother said?

Donâ€™t you understand?
I donâ€™t care what she thinks.

What anybody thinks.

John, thereâ€™s
someone else.

Your father.

I came back here
to find him again.

And he was dead.

And there you were.

And I took you like
a wonderful confection.

What are you
talking about?

I substituted
you.

Thatâ€™s what it was.
Um, itâ€™s mistaken identity.

I donâ€™t believe
that.

Well,
that is what it is.

And you deserve
more.

Can I hold you?

Goodbye, Maggie.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Hi, babe.
Hi.

Donâ€™t have any
pictures of you.

CLAIRE:
No. No pictures. Down.

I have burned every
single one after 40.


Bitch. Why do I even want
to be your partner?

Oh, youâ€™re gonna have to sign
these papers before you leave.

Oh, I finally get
my old friend back

and you, you change
your mind and take off.

Why are you
running away again?

The whole summer
Iâ€™ve let you pound me,

analyze me, tell me
whatâ€™s best for me.

You donâ€™t know
whatâ€™s best for me.

Nobody does.

First Patrick.
Hmm?

And now youâ€™re running away
from John.

Enough!
John is a gift.

Donâ€™t throw
it away.

Itâ€™s none
of your business.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Now you just shut up.


You take care of
this place.

Iâ€™m a silent partner,
but I can complain.

At the soccer game,

when you told me
about you and John,

I was scared for you,
Maggie,

because I thought
youâ€™d get hurt.

That it was just
a sexual thing for him.

But today I stopped
by his place

and the way he talks about you,
he does love you.

I know.

What are you
afraid of?

Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™ll never
know where he stands.

As much as
you love him?

Come on. Look, no one
has a crystal ball.

Take the risk.

Itâ€™s worth it.

Iâ€™m doing whatâ€™s
best for him.

And best for me.

No. I, uh...

He gave me this
for you.

MAGGIE:
Patrick, where are you?

Iâ€™ve come
to say goodbye.

Couldnâ€™t do it
before.

"Maggie, I found this
in my fatherâ€™s belongings.

He never mailed it."

"Dear Maggie.
I was saddened by your letter

"and what youâ€™ve been
going through.

"The loss of your mother,
your fatherâ€™s illness,

"that you wouldnâ€™t be back
to The Moon this summer.

"When I called to talk to you,
your father told me

"that the real reason
you werenâ€™t coming back

"was because you had
met another guy.

"That you couldnâ€™t
tell me.

"He asked me
not to write to you.

"All right, dear, Maggie.
I wish you joy and what else?

"And whatever happens
to you or me,

"remember,

"weâ€™ve got to live lives

"fully and unafraid,

"like we pledged
to each other.

Love, Patrick."

Can I
join you?

I just want to
be with you.
