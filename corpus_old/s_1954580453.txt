Kara: Pre-law is hell.

The workload
is near impossible,

and if you want to get into

any of the decent
law schools,

don't even bother trying
unless you have a 4.0.

At least I had that much,
but even that wasn't enough.

You need a killer transcript,
volunteer hours

and of course money,
tons of money.

And that's what
I didn't have, lots of it.

The thing is, easy money,

you always end up
paying for it.

Hey.
Hey.

Can I get some
fruit with that?

Yeah, here you go.

Thanks.

All right,
we've got a beer,

two shots and a vodka soda.

Here, Kara,
have a shot with us.

I can't. I'm working.

Come on, just one.

Sorry.
It's on us.

Sorry.

That's just perfect.

Are you okay?

I've got
to get cleaned up.

We're slammed.
I'm drenched.

What happened to you?

Oh, Just the usual:

serving drunks
and getting dumped on.

Hey, are you going
back to our room?

No, why?

Just wanted you
to grab me a shirt.

Sorry. I'm going
to a party.

You should come, you know,
when you're done here.

I can't. I've got
a paper to finish.

Oh, well, you know
what they say:

all work and no play,
well, that's just lame.

Hey.
Hi.

That dress is so hot.

That ring.

Hey, gorgeous.

Hi. What are you
doing here?

I just wanted to see you.

I'm happy you're here.

Text me if you
change your mind.

Hey.
Hi.

What the hell is going on?

I don't know.

He's like 82.

Shh, shh, shh.

Is that your new roommate's
dad or her boyfriend?

I have no idea.

Hey, Kara, I need to
talk to you for a sec.

I hate to do this,

but I kind of hired
too many people

at the beginning
of the term,

so I'm going to have
to cut you loose.

You're firing me?

Not firing,
letting you go.

I'll give you a call
if we need more help.

But I need a job now.

Okay.

Professor: If I had a client
who I knew was guilty,

could I morally
represent him?

Now, the law dictates that
he has a right to be defended,

but could you,

or more importantly
should you do it?

I want you to pose
that question to yourselves

and answer it in your next
essay due in a week.

Kara, can I see you
for a minute?

Yeah.

Are you still interested
in a summer internship?

Of course.

Well, I just heard that
the Women's Law Shelter
is looking for somebody.

Now, they don't normally
accept pre-law grads,

but it's worth a shot,

although you should know
that it's full-time,
and it doesn't pay.

Oh, I didn't realize.

Well if it's something
you can't manage,
I understand,

but if you could,
it would look great
on your transcript.

Okay, I'll
think about it.
Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

Roommate:
What do you think?

Does the color
wash me out?

No, it's fine.

$849?

Hey, who was that guy
with the Ferrari?

Oh, you mean David?

He's just a friend.

A friend?

Is that whose party you
went to the other night?

You would know
if you came.

You know,
it doesn't have to be
so hard, Kara.

You know, ever since
the semester started,

all I've seen you do
is work and study.

I have to.

No, you don't.

Look, why don't you
come out with me
tonight?

You can wear one
of my new dresses.

I highly doubt
I can afford a place

where I have to wear
a dress like that,

especially since
I lost my job.

Well that's perfect
because you won't have
to pay for a thing.

Come on,
it's just one night.

You deserve it.

All right. I'll see
if Justin can come.

No way. This is
a girls night only.

Trust me,
you're gonna love it.

â™ª Running to the bright lights,
chasing our dreams â™ª

â™ª Pulling up
in a long black limousine â™ª

â™ª I got champagne,
vodka, what we need â™ª

â™ª Don't ask what we did
to get these things â™ª

â™ª It's a dirty little secret,
I won't tell â™ª

â™ª Everyone has got
their price to sell â™ª

â™ª Living in the fast lane
grabbing that cash â™ª

â™ª Can't stop now,
we're gonna crash â™ª

â™ª Oh, living
the high life â™ª

â™ª Oh, oh, oh,
living the high life â™ª

â™ª Oh, oh, oh,
living the high life â™ª

â™ª High life... â™ª

Ooh, there's my girl.

Hey, baby. Mmm.

David, this is
my roommate, Kara.

Hello.
Hi.

I thought that
you could, you know,
introduce her.

Of course. Anything
for you, sweetheart.

( laughs ) I'll go
get us some drinks.

Okay.

Actually,
I think I'm okay.

Whenever you're ready.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

I mean, David
is hardly just a friend,

and this, this is
obviously a meat market.

It's a lot classier
than that.

Really? Old men hooking
up with 20-year-olds
is classy?

These men have a hell
of a lot more class

than the frat boys
on campus.

Thank you.

Here, drink this
and mingle, or don't.

Shawna. Shawna, wait.

You look lost.

I'm looking for someone.

Why are you
so uncomfortable?

Everyone's enjoying
themselves except you.

Maybe I don't
consider this fun.

You don't consider
a party fun?

Let me guess.
You are a college student.

You take your studies
very seriously.

You probably work
weekends or even nights

when everyone else is out?

Is that a problem?

Not at all.

In fact, I respect it.

I know from
firsthand experience

what a struggle it is
to make ends meet.

But now I am in a position

where I might be able
to help others.

Okay, excuse me,
you are?

Grant Zager.
And you are?

Kara Jones.

Look, I appreciate your
respect, Mr. Zager,

but I don't need
your help.

I don't think
she's ready.

No, she's ambitious,

and you know how much
I love a challenge.

I know, I know,
and I wish

it would've turned out
differently, too.

Man on phone:
Okay, sorry.

Thank you, though, yeah.

Mom, are you all right?

Oh, Kara, sweetheart.

What's going on?

Well, it looks like

we lost the fight with
the insurance company.

I don't believe it.
I mean, this is
an accident.

I know, but they denied
the coverage,

and there's nothing
we can do.

I don't even know
if we're going to be able

to hold onto the house.

Maybe I should
move back home.

No, no, no, no.
We've talked about this.

Now your father and I
want you to be
close to campus

so that you can focus
on your work.

You've worked so hard.

We just want you
to be able to get into
a decent law school.

There's my girl.

Hi, Dad. Missed you.

You're back
at work already?

Yeah, first week back.

I feel great.

I was looking at
your VW out front.

How's it holding up?

It got me here.

How's your Vette?

Do you mean that
fully restored Vette

that I just drove up in?

Why don't you tell me?

Wow, sweet.

This is amazing.

Yeah, yeah,
it's hard to believe

it was just once
a rusty frame, huh?

Yeah.

You keep doing us proud,

it's going to make you
a pretty decent
graduation present.

Are you serious?

Just gotta
finish law school.

Mom told me about
the insurance.

( sighs )

It's my job to get you
through school.

If we have to make
a few sacrifices

to do that, so be it.

Get in there
and fire this bad boy up.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

So how's
the job hunting going?

Bad. Most of the
part-time positions

have been filled for
the semester already.

Can your parents help out?

They owe so much for
my dad's medical bills

they can't even help
with tuition right now.

Well, don't worry about it.

I'm sure you'll find
a way to do it.

( cell phone rings )

( ringing )

Hello?

Man on phone:
Kara? Grant Zager here.

How did you get
my number?

Your roommate
gave it to me.

I hope
that's not a problem.

Yes, it is.

Oh. Well, you have
my number now.

I'm hoping you'll call.

Kara, take it
from someone

who did it
all on his own.

Everyone needs some help.

What do you think?

She'll call.

You gave him my number?

I guess he called you.

Why would you do that?

Because he asked for it.

Trust me, a lot of girls

would kill to be
with Grant Zager.

He's like
the sugar daddy jackpot.

So that's what David is,
your sugar daddy?

Look, don't get
all moralistic on me,
all right?

He's an adult
and I'm an adult.

We're not doing
anything wrong.

Well, you're
having sex, right?

So?

Okay, wait.

So how does
all this work?

Easy, I give him
what he wants,

and in return,
I get what I want.

As in money?

Yeah, lots of money.

Look, I make myself
available to him

whenever he wants
my company,

and in return,
he pays my tuition.

It doesn't bother you
that he's so old?

In the dark, everyone
looks and feels the same.

Look, just go out
with him once, just once.

I mean,
what could it hurt?

If you don't like it,
then forget it.

But if you do,

say goodbye
to all your problems.

I am so glad you called.

I thought we were
going to dinner.

We are.

In San Francisco.

Welcome aboard.

Buckle up.

Do you think
people will think

I'm your daughter
or your girlfriend?

( laughs )

Either way, right now
it doesn't make a difference

because every man
in this room

is jealous of me.

So tell me,
what are you studying?

Well, right now
I'm studying political
science as my major

because I want
to go to law school.

Just what this world
needs, another lawyer.

I'm kidding.

Hey, if you're any good,
I'll hire you.

Something tells me
you're going to be good.

Just leave it
in the middle, thanks.

So you've chosen
a very competitive field.

Now, what are you
going to do

to get a leg up
on the competition?

Well, I just applied
for an internship

with the Women's
Law Shelter.

It's a not-for-profit.

I've heard of it.

Here.

Thank you.

It's really good.

No. Champagne.

With caviar...

champagne.

It accents the flavor.

So what did you study?
Oh, same as you.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

You're a lawyer?

Oh, not even close.

I studied law
for a couple of years,

but then I realized
I was much better suited
for the investment world.

So what I do now is
I buy broken companies,

I fix them up,

I make them profitable,
then I sell them.

It's a good business.

You're just like
my dad.

He really likes buying
these broken-down cars
and restoring them.

A car lover?

We have something
in common,

though I would prefer

if you don't compare me
to your father.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--

That's all right.

I just want you to see me
as something else.

So how are you paying
your way through school?

My parents
help a little,

but my dad
got into this car
accident last year,

and his medical
insurance said that
he wasn't covered,

so now they have to pay.

How much?

$80,000.

That's about what you need
to get through law school.

Yeah.

So here's the thing.

I think one of these
every month could help.

I have a boyfriend.

We both have lives.

I just think
they could be enhanced...

By a special relationship.

Think about it.

Come on.

Where did he take you,
The Grove, 360?

San Francisco.

Are you serious?

Yeah, he took us there
on his private jet.

Oh, my God, you are
such a lucky bitch.

Did you join
the mile-high club?

No, it wasn't like that.

He actually
was a gentleman.

I knew it.
Grant's such a score.

But you guys
have a deal, right?

I don't know.

I just told him
I'd think about it.

Seriously, what is there
to think about?

Grant is the whole package.

With him you're able
to do whatever you want.

Professional conduct.

This is regulated
by a very specific code

detailing what
is considered good behavior

and unacceptable behavior.

So unless you want
to get into trouble...

Professor:
Kara?

Kara?

Have you made a decision
about the internship?

Can you do it, or am
I asking someone else?

Yeah, I can do it.

Wow. You look spectacular.

Shall we?

Grant: Is there
anything I can do

to make you
more comfortable?

How about a drink?

Sure.

Cheers.
Cheers.

So...

So...

Shall we
take it upstairs?

Maybe you prefer
another room?

The gym, the pool table,
the garage?

( chuckles )

I'm just kidding.

( exhales ) Relax.

Okay.

I'm not going to ask you
to do anything

that you don't want to do.

I want you
to enjoy yourself.

Come.

You okay?

You were wonderful.

That ought to
take care of your
student debt, huh?

So did he
ease you into it,

or did he just take you?

( all laugh )

He was actually...

He was very considerate.

You're lucky.

My guy's wife
isn't into role play,

so guess who gets
to play dress-up?

Your sugar daddy's married?

You're surprised?

Besides, you have
a boyfriend, don't you?

Look, I'm sure
you're fine.

Grant seems like
a classy guy.

Besides, just do what I do.

You just close your eyes

and pretend like it's
the hottest guy ever.

And then when you open them,
it's all over.

Okay,
so what's going on?
What's the latest?

Well, I just applied
for an internship.

That's great. With whom?

The Women's Law Shelter.

I mean, it doesn't pay,

but it'll look really good
on my transcript if I get it.

Are you
going to be able

to keep your job
at the pub?

Yeah, for sure.
Don't worry.

Here. Just a little
something to help out.

Thank you, guys,

but really,
I mean, I'm fine.

I think you guys need it
more than I do right now.

Really, I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

So what's going on
with you, hmm?

Is there something
you don't want
your old man to know?

What are you talking about?

GPS, young lady.
You turned it off.

I can't track
my little girl anymore.

Dad.
Barry.

( laughs )

Um, I'm kind of
grown up now.

I figured it was time
to cut the cord.

Oh, oh, we're playing
the grown-up card.

I guess that means
I can't take her out

for an ice cream
sundae later on.

You know,
I wouldn't do that.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

I never said I didn't like
ice cream anymore.

Oh, then you're back in.
Thank you.

You're back
on the team, honey.

Yeah, baby, nice.

All right, it's a deal.

( engine won't start )

Come on.

( cell phone rings )

Hello?

Kara, Grant here.

Oh, hi.

Something wrong?
You sound upset.

Oh, nothing.

I just can't get
my car to start.

Obviously
you're going to need

a lift to my place
tonight.

Tonight? I'm--

Um, I have plans.

Cancel them.
I'll see you at 8:00.

You need a jump?

Yes, please.
Okay, pop the hood.

All right. Yeah, just
leave it running, okay?

Okay.

Hey, so we still on
for the movie tonight?

Um...actually I can't.

I've got
a paper to write

and a test to study for.

Okay.

I promise I'll
make it up to you.

It's no big deal.

Just let me know
when you're free.

Okay.

( sighs )

I hope you didn't eat.

Peter's going to pick up
some dinner for us.

Will he be joining us?

Do you have
a problem with him?

Peter is...
he's a very good friend.

We grew up together.

( cell phone rings )

Sorry.

You can answer that
if you want to.

Oh, this is just...
it's my mom.

I'll just
call her back later.

Do you have
a good relationship
with your parents?

I do.

Lucky you.

How about you?

Do you have any family?

This is a pretty big
house for one person.

If you're asking me
if I'm married, no.

Why should I get married

when I can have a relationship
with somebody like you?

( laughs )

If this works out
between us,

I'd like to help your father
with his medical bills.

You would do that?

Sure.

It was $80,000?

It's no problem.

Oh, my God.
Come here.

I have something for you.

They're so beautiful.

Put them on.

How do they look?

Dance with me.

â™ª Night â™ª

â™ª Nighttime â™ª

â™ª Makes it all right â™ª

â™ª Anywhere... â™ª

Don't move.

â™ª Anything
that you want to know â™ª

â™ª Every lie
that I've ever told â™ª

â™ª Nighttime â™ª

â™ª Yeah, in the nighttime â™ª

Man, it must be nice
getting all that
fancy jewelry

just for doing what
you girls like to do.

What is that
supposed to mean?

Don't play games with me.

I don't have
anything you need.

You sound jealous.

Hey.

Hey.

Hi.

Are you okay?

What are you doing here?

My dorm's
just down the street.

What about you?

Are you just
rolling in, too?

I was just at my boyfriend's.

Which one?

( laughs )

Where were you?

Oh, you know,
just playing dress-up.

Let's see, tonight

I was "dirty
flight attendant."

Does it bother you,
having to do that?

Does it bother you?

It's not so bad, I guess.

Yeah, well, that's
because you're lucky.

Grant's good-looking,
and he's a gentleman.

Not all of them
are like that.

Some will
make you do things,

things you
wouldn't even do with
your own boyfriend,

things that no matter
how many times you shower,

they'll never
come off you.

Leah, I'm sorry.

Get off me.
Leah.

( knocking )

Hey, you still studying?

Yeah.
I thought so.

So I brought you
a midnight snack.

Thanks.

I thought you were just
bringing me a snack.

That was just my cover.

Um...I'm kind of tired.

Would you mind if
we just, like, hung out?

Is that okay?

Sure, sure.

Everything okay?

Yeah, everything's fine.

Whoa.

What?

That is one big rock.

Who'd you get that from?

Oh, I just borrowed
these from Shawna.

To study?

Actually,
speaking of studying,

I should probably
get back to it.

I have so much stuff
to do tomorrow,

I'm just really
overwhelmed.

I'll, like, come over
to your place tomorrow?

Sure, whatever.

Is that okay?
Mm-hmm.

So before I forget,
you got your internship.

How do you know?

I made some calls,
I pulled some strings,
so it's yours.

I don't know
what to say.

Say you're happy.

I'm happy.

See, this relationship
can work out for both of us.

Oh, um...

Peter's
like right there.

Just close your eyes.

Hey, Shawna, you know
where Kara is?

She's your girlfriend,
not mine.

I know, I just--

I tried texting her,
and she never got back to me.

It's just not like her.

Maybe she's
in the library.

You know how they are
about phones in there.

Yeah, maybe.

Those are some nice
earrings you loaned her.
Nice rocks.

What earrings?
I didn't loan her
any earrings.

Leah, this is Justin,
Kara's boyfriend.

Did Kara mention to you

where she was going tonight?

Oh, um...

Don't worry.
I get it.

Ahem.

Hey.

Where were you?

You said
you'd come by tonight.

I'm so sorry.

I totally forgot.

And you couldn't
even return my texts?

I forgot to check my phone.
I'm sorry.

I just had to get out.

Dressed like that?

You know, I ran
into Shawna tonight,

and she told me
she never lent you
those pair of earrings,

so where'd
you get them, Kara?

From whoever
you were with tonight?

No, I was just out
with some girlfriends.

Oh, don't lie to me,
all right?

I mean, I can
smell him on you.

So who is he?

Justin, please--

Stop, stop,
stop, stop.

Just tell me he's not
one of those sugar daddies.

I don't believe this.

You don't understand.

I understand
just fine, Kara.

Check this out.

My new sugar daddy
gave it to me
last night.

Was this before
or after you saw Justin?

Hey, I did what I could
to cover for you,
all right?

But, I mean, how long
did you think

you could keep it
a secret?

Look, forget about
Justin, all right?

You're only 21.
Have fun.

Is that what you're
having, Shawna, fun?

About 12 carats of it.

Plus this guy
has serious potential.

As what?
My future husband.

Are you serious?

What, don't you think
I'd make a great
trophy wife?

I thought you
were just doing this
to get through school.

I am. I'm securing
my future,

academically
and financially.

Plus this guy
will probably croak

before I even
hit my peak.

So you're just
a gold digger, then?

Yeah, those rocks
that Justin was
talking about,

I'm sure you went
digging for them.

Look, don't pretend
like you're any better
than me.

At least I know
what I am and I own it.

You seem
very quiet tonight.

I'm fine.

I've had enough
experience with women

to know that
when she says, "I'm fine,"

she's probably not.

That's all right.

I've got
something planned

that will make you
happy tonight.

So you haven't said anything
about my new set of wheels.

It's nice.

Nice? This is nice?

Well, I'd have to drive
it first to know that.

Of course. You are
an auto mechanic's daughter.

Well, I hope you like
the drive, because it's yours.

What?

I figured
you needed a new car.

Am I right?

Um...( laughs )

This is...this is...
this is way too much.

I don't know
what to say.

Don't worry.

You will
make it up to me.

( laughs )

How old are you?

I'm not going to
tell you how old I am.

Why not?

Because it will probably
freak you out,

and you'll leave me.

Okay, well,
I'm just going to
ask you questions

until I figure it out.

Oh, really?
Yeah.

Okay, go ahead.

So when you were a kid,

did you guys
have electric power?

( laughs )

The year after I was born.

Uh-huh?

They invented it.
Oh.

Hmm. Interesting.

( laughs )

Now I'm going
to ask you a question.

Okay.

What is the kinkiest thing...

you have ever done
sexually?

I knew you were
going to ask me this.

Well, other than
doing it with a guy

that went to high school
with Abraham Lincoln,

I don't know.

I kind of have a thing
for chocolate syrup.

What about you?

What's the kinkiest
thing you've ever done?

I like to be choked.

Oh, okay.

( laughs )

Wait, you're serious?

It's the most unbelievable
high you have ever had.

Wait, really?

Get on top of me.

When the moment
is right,

you take your hands
and put them here, okay?

And you squeeze hard
right there. Harder.

Just like that.
Harder. Yeah.

Oh, it's just amazing.

The next time
you're here...

I want you
to do that to me.

I...I don't know.

I don't know
if I can do that.

Yes, you can.

It's okay.

You'll learn.

You already paid me
for this month.

I think this more
than adequately covers

your father's
medical expenses.

Yes. Yes, it would.

I don't know
what to say.

I admit I'm a little bit...
eccentric.

And I have certain needs.

This check is yours
if those needs are met.

Mrs. Jones' voice:
They denied the coverage,

and there's nothing
we can do.

I don't even know
if we're going to be able
to hold on to the house.

Take your hands,
put them here.

Harder. just like that.
Harder.

Grant's voice: I think this more
than adequately covers

your father's
medical expenses.

I like to be choked.

( gasps )

( crashing )

Wow. Where'd you say
you got this?

This dealer by school.

They said it came in
brand-new

except for
the front end damage,

so I made a really
good deal with him.

Don't worry. I wouldn't
have done it if I couldn't.

Hmm.

I'll tell you what.

Why don't
you leave it tonight?

I'll knock out
the front end.

Let the old man go
through it, all right?

Tires, tune-up.

You never know what you
get when you buy used.

Thanks, Dad.

Yeah.

Oh, speaking of old man,
happy birthday.

Sweetie.

Barry:
So, yeah,

we have a lawyer
in the family, all right?

Because of a bike
with training wheels.

Yes, seriously.

She wasn't having it
when she was a kid,

so I promised her one day.

I said, okay, when
I get home from work,

I'll take
the training wheels off.

It's my kid.

She doesn't wait
for anything.

So I get home.
My wife is in the kitchen.

She's in a state of shock
because she can't find her.

So I get in the car.

I'm driving around
looking for her.

Then I see her.

And I pull up next to her

and go, "Hey, sweetie."

She goes, "Dad, look!
No training wheels!"

And she's going along.

I said,
"Baby, turn it around,

let's head home."

She goes, "Dad,

I only know
how to go straight."

She's been going full steam
forward ever since.

Ah, to Kara,
best daughter
a guy ever had.

Oh, and happy
birthday, old man.

( cell phone rings )
Hey, that's right.

I'm an old man today.

Come on, sweetie.

Yeah.

Hook me up tonight.

Hey, it's Kara.
Sorry I missed your call.

Please leave a message.

( beep )

Mrs. Jones:
So your father tells me

you bought yourself
a car.

A used car.

( cell phone rings )
You know, honey,

we're not gonna be
able to help you much
with tuition next year.

No, I know. It's okay.

I got a second job waitressing
at a new restaurant,

so tips are great.

Great. Hey, I thought
Justin was coming today.

I know. He couldn't.
He had too much work.

( cell phone rings )
Who keeps calling?

Uh, this is my roommate.

I think she, uh,
might need something.

I'll be right back, okay?

Hello?

Where have you been?

I'm at my parents.

Well, you need to leave now.

I have a function
at the club.

I want you
to be there with me.

I had them put you
on the list

so we can meet there.

I can't. It's my Dad's
birthday.

I don't care
what it is, Kara.

I expect you in an hour.

No, I need to be here.

Do I have to remind you
about our arrangement?

Look, I thought
you gave me this car

so I could spend more
time with my family.

When it doesn't
interfere with my plans.

I expect you in an hour.

No. I'm sorry, Grant.

Kara! Kara!

Hey, I was wondering
if I could ask you
a biggie.

Sure.

I'm short on cash
and I just need
a little bit

to hold me over until
I land my next daddy.

What happened
to Mr. Jessup?

He dumped me.

How much?

$500?

I don't even know
if I have that.

Do you have anything
that I can pawn?

I mean, Grant's
a generous guy, right?

Look, I promise
I'll pay you back.

I have some earrings.

Great. I'll pick them up
after class, yeah?

And like I said,
I'll pay you back.

Grant Zager.

What can I get you?

Looking for Kara Jones.
She works here.

Not anymore.
We had to let her go
a few weeks ago.

Excuse me.

Grant?

Grant?

You're mad at me,
aren't you?

Disappointed.

How was your father's
birthday?

It was nice.

How was your event?

Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't have a date.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I have been extremely
generous with you.

And even though you're
not willing to give me

what I really want,
what I asked for
the other night,

the only thing I have ever
expected in return

is that you be there
when I need you.

Kara: But you told me
at the last minute.

I mean,
you have to give me
some advance notice.

That's not the way
this works.

Hey, listen.

Excuse me?

Looking for a guy
named Grant Zager?

Is that you?

No. I work for him.
Who are you?

I'm Kara Jones's father.

Apparently, your boss
bought my daughter a car.

I just want to know why.

I want
to make you happy.

I really do.

Is he home?

Yeah. You can't go
in there.

Is my daughter in there?

Yeah. Tell you what.
Why don't you give me
your phone number

and I'll have Mr. Zager
contact you.

Just keep your hands
away from me.

Kara!
Kara, you in there?

This is private
property, okay?

You need to leave now.

I just want to ask the
man a simple question.

You Zager?

I am. Who are you?

Dad, what are you
doing here?

Dad?

Peter, it's okay.

Why you dressed
like that?

What are you-- what
are you doing here?

Dad, he's just a friend.

Why did he buy you
a car?

He didn't.

Then why is his name
on the registration?

Hmm? Does he give you
money, too?

Mr. Jones, I'm just trying
to help your daughter

cover some of her
expenses, that's all.

You know, just because
you live in a big house

and you make
a lot of money

doesn't mean you can talk
to me like I'm an idiot.

I know exactly
what's going on here!

It's not what you think.

He's giving you
money for sex!

Or am I wrong?

Am I missing
something here, huh?

What's the matter
with you?

What? You can't get
a woman your own age?

What, are you some
kind of pervert?

Don't walk
away from me, pal!

This is not some hooker
you pick up in a bar!

This is my little girl!

She is not
your little girl.

She is a grown-up,
all right?

And she is beautiful.

Dad!

Grant:
You son of a bitch!

Get the hell
out of here now!

Kara, come on!
Get in the car!

I'm staying here.

I am 21 years old, okay?

I can choose who I want
to spend my time with.

There's nothing wrong
with what I'm doing here.

You love this guy, huh?

Then it's about
the money.

And where I come from,
that's wrong.

You don't understand
what's going on here, Dad.

He's been really good to me.

He's the most generous man
I've ever met.

Dad, I didn't mean it
like that.

Dad, I'm sorry.
Please, Dad, I'm sorry!

That guy
is a piece of crap!

I'm just trying to get
through school, Dad.

What does that make you?

Huh? What does that
make you?

I'm just trying
to pay for school.

Dad, I'm sorry.

Dad, please forgive me.

Come home
when you smarten up!

Dad!

Are you okay?

No, I am not okay.

How did he get a hold
of the car registration?

He's fixing it.

What do you mean,
he's fixing it?

It's a brand-new car.

I sort of
got into an accident.

Unbelievable.

Look, I'm sorry.

I wasn't thinking clearly.

It's what happens when somebody
asks me to strangle them.

What did you think
this was going to be,

a love affair?

You know what? This
really isn't working,

and I think it's best
that we don't see each
other anymore.

Grant! Hey.

Peter will give you
a lift home.

He'll come and pick up
the car tomorrow.

Wait.

What about the check?

For my family?

Goodbye.

Hi, Dad.

VW's ready.
Keys are in it.

Thanks.

Dad, I just did what
I thought I had to do

to get into law school.

I just wanted to keep
making you proud.

Do you think
it makes me proud

that you prostitute
yourself?

He was going to pay off
your medical debt.

$100,000.

I don't want his money.

I raised you
better than that.

I'm so sorry.

Well, I've gotta take
Grant's car back to him, so...

Well, let me get
the door for you.

No, Dad!

There you go.

Hi, Kara.

You wanted to see me?

Yes, come on in.

Why don't you have a seat?

Okay.

Well, I just heard

that the shelter
changed their mind.

They're not gonna
offer you the internship.

Why?

I don't know.

Just that
they made a mistake.

I'm so sorry.

Barry's voice:
That guy is a piece of crap!

What does that
make you, huh?

What does that make you?

Stop, stop, stop!

What did you think
this was going to be,

a love affair?

Hey, what's wrong?

Everything.

He dumped you, didn't he?

Yep. My Dad showed up.

Made a big scene.

Told you, these guys
don't like drama.

Yeah, well,
now I'm screwed.

He took away the car.

Put a stop payment
on my last check.

Dorm fees are due
in like two days.

I spent all my money
on fall tuition.

I'm totally broke.

So call your parents.

I can't. My parents
are broke, too.

And, besides,
they want to disown me.

Justin hates me.

I don't know what to do.

Then you have
to go back to Grant.

You have him on your side,
you don't need anybody else.

He doesn't want
to see me again.

Yes, he does.

He's a lonely old man
with a drawer full of Viagra.

If there's one thing I've
learned from all of this,

is that these guys
like to feel needed.

So just dry
your pretty little eyes.

Better yet, don't.

Go tell him
how much you need him.

Kara? Hi.

Hi.

How do they look?

I thought you were
gonna pawn them.

I am. Just figured
I'd wear them first.

You know, maybe
score myself another
daddy with them.

Speak of the devil.

Give me a sec,
will you?

Missed you.

Really?

Did you miss me?

Grant, please give me
another chance.

We had a deal, and I
should have honored it.

I promise I'll be
where you want me to be

when you want me to be.

And my father,
he'll never bother us.

I can have any woman
in this room.

I don't need
your problems.

Let me show you I can be
what you want me to be.

Okay.

Have your friend
over there

come back with you
to my house.

And we'll see
if you really mean that.

Leah: Oh, my God!

This house!

Oh, your house
is amazing.

Why don't you make
yourself comfortable?

Have a drink.

And I'll meet you
upstairs in the bedroom.

Okay.

I can't do this.

Yes, you can.

Look, take this.

Trust me, it'll help.

If you don't do this,

he'll just find
someone else who will.

So do me a favor

and don't spoil this
for the both of us.

You're not the only one
who needs the money.

Come here.

Kiss her.

Come on.

Kara? Kara?

Hey, wait, wait, wait.

Forget about her.

I'll do anything
you want.

( coughs )

Yeah, like that.

You're a bad boy,
aren't you?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah!
Come on! Harder!

Let's see
if I get my money's worth.

Yeah, hmm?

Is that what you want?

( gagging and coughing )

( vomiting )

Okay, how was that?

It's all right, huh?

What's the matter?

Come on.

Leah!

Oh, my God!

Oh, God!

Leah, come on, let's go.

Leah, come on.

Hey, Leah? Leah?

Leah? Leah?

Oh, my God!

Grant! Grant! Grant!

Grant!

Grant! Grant!

Grant! Oh, my God,
Grant, it's Leah!

I know, I know.
She's drunk.

No, she's not drunk!

She's very, very drunk.

No, she's dead!

No, no!
Yes, she's dead!

No! No! She's...

Look at her!
She's not moving!

I don't understand.
She was just here.

Well, of course
she was here.

Who moved her?
What do you--

Listen to me!
She didn't feel well.

No, no.
She drank too much.

She was
just right there!

Peter got her a cab.

He didn't want her
getting sick in the car.

But I don't understand.

She was just here.
I saw her.

Are you on something, Kara?

'Cause that's what drugs do.

They distort the mind.

This is why
I don't take 'em.

But I swear
she was just there.

Kara, listen.
You're not listening.

Okay, I think
you should take a rest.

You need to lie down.
We'll go downstairs--

I'm going home.
Kara, stay--

I wanna go home.

Kara:
No, I'm leaving!

I don't wanna be
anywhere near you
anymore!

Kara!
Let me go!

I'm going home!

Where's the car?

Peter takes it home
with him every night.

Are you sure you can drive?

I'm fine.

Kara!

( cell phone rings )

( ringing )

It's all under control.

What am I gonna do
about Kara?

Just do
what you always do.

Give her what she wants

and she'll
forget about it.

Aah!

Hey. Have you seen
my tennis shoes?

I wanna go to the gym
before I crash out.

What's wrong with you?

Have you seen Leah?

No. Why? Do you think
she finally hooked up?

She did,
with me and Grant.

Ooh! I take it
you made up with him.

This isn't a joke,
Shawna.

Okay. Well,
it was just one night.

Just forget about it.

I can't. It was awful.

Leah, she gave me
this stuff,

you know, to get me
through it.

I got really sick, so
I went to the bathroom.

And when I came out,
Leah was...

What?

I think she was dead.

What are you talking about?

I don't know. I just
kept shaking her,

but she didn't move.

Well, did you call 911?

I mean, she probably
overdosed or something.

No, I didn't,

'cause when I finally
found Grant, she was gone.

He said he sent
her home in a cab.

God, Kara, don't
mess with me like that.

Look, I'm not
messing with you.

I saw her.

You were on drugs?

Do you know what that stuff
does to your head?

I talked
to her roommate.

She said
she never came home.

Leah does this kind
of stuff all the time.

She goes on benders

and just comes back
whenever she feels like it.

Trust me, she'll call you
back by the end of the day.

She's fine.

What the hell
are you doing?

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

Forget about her.

I'll do anything
you want.

You're a bad boy,
aren't you?

Aah! ( choking )

What's the matter?
Leah? Leah?

Leah!

Oh, God!

( cell phone rings )

( ringing )

( ringing )

Come on, come on, pick up.

( ringing )

Aah!

Hey, I brought you
some coffee.

Thanks.

There's some dinner
inside if you're hungry.

Barry, she's still
our daughter,

and she needs you.

Kara?

Hi.

Hi.

What are you doing here?

Grant says you haven't
been returning his calls.

Just been really busy.

How is that
your business?

Well, It's my business
'cause I look out for him.

You know that.

He's waiting for you
in the car.

He's got something for you.

Come on.

You are a hard girl
to get hold of.

When I make a promise...

I keep it.

Leah: How do they look?

Grant:
Peter got her a cab!

He didn't want her
getting sick in the car.

Grant, I can't
accept this.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

I have a class
I have to get to.

I promise I'll call you.

She knows. She knows.

Why'd you let her go?

What the hell
am I supposed to do,

keep her as a hostage?

I didn't mean
to kill that girl.

I am not gonna lose

everything I have
worked for all my life

because of
a couple of dumb coeds!

I'll take care of it.

How? What are you
gonna do?

Look, I'm a part
of this thing now, too.

No, absolutely not.

She's gonna go to the cops.

Can you do the time?

'Cause I've done
my fair share,

and I'm not going back.

And I sure the hell
ain't gonna let you do it.

I was messed up.

I was this close
to being dead.

You came back for me.
You saved my ass.

I don't forget that.

No, we're gonna pretend

that this conversation
never happened.

Let me handle it.

She didn't go home
in a cab.

What are you
talking about?

Leah. Grant said
she went home in a cab,

but she didn't.

How do you know that?

I found this in Grant's car.

I gave them to Leah,

and she was still wearing
them when I found her.

That doesn't mean
anything.

Of course it does.
It means that he lied.

So what? So she went home
in his car. Who cares?

Leah is missing.

I swear, if she doesn't
come tonight,

I'm going to the police.

Don't be such
a drama queen, all right?

You could blow this
for all of us.

The last thing
these guys want

is anybody getting
into their business.

My God, Kara,
you don't seriously think

that Grant did
something to her, do you?

( beeps )

( beeps )

GPS on.

( cell phone rings )

( ringing )

( ringing )

Hey, Dad.

Yeah. You turned on
your GPS.

Was that a mistake?

No, no.
It wasn't a mistake.

Dad, you still there?

Yeah.

Look, I just want you
to know that--( gasp )

What?

Kara, what--

Kara?

Hey, what's going on?

I don't know.

Something's wrong.

What?

I'm gonna find out.

Do you want me
to come along?

No. Stay here in case
she comes home.

( cell phone rings )

I'll call you
when it's done.

( muffled cries ) Help!

Uh!

( cocks gun )

( gasps )

Kara!

What are you gonna do?

Oh, it's not what
I'm gonna do to you.

It's what
you're gonna do.

Tie your arm off
with it.

Tie it off!

No one would ever believe
I would do this.

Really? Remember
all the drugs you did
the other night?

They're still
in your system.

That's gonna tell
a different story,
isn't it?

Now do it.

'Cause
if I have to do it,

I'm gonna hurt you
a hell of a lot worse.

Tie yourself off!

Please, please.

Please, no.

Please?
Do it!

Kara?

No!

( crying )

It's okay, sweetie.
Let's get out of here.

( cell phone rings )

( ringing )

Leave it alone!

( ringin continues )

Hey, what the hell's
going on, huh?

You said you were
gonna call me.

You said this was
gonna be done already.

Did you--

Is she... Peter?

I think Peter
broke your arrangement.

Oh, my God.

Get the plane ready.
I'm on my way.

Yes, Grant Zager,
that's right.

He has a plane at
the West Side Airport.

Man on phone:
Yes, ma'am.

I need this plane off
the ground in five minutes.

Mr. Zager?

We need to ask you
a few questions.

( siren,
police radio dispatch )

( siren peals )

Hey, Dad.

Hey, sweetie.

Need some help?

All I can get.
Got a 3/8?

3/8.

Thanks.

That should do it.

You feel like
taking a ride?

Kara: I learned a lot
in my last year of college.

No matter how badly
you want something

or how ambitious you are,

there are some things
that just aren't worth it.

My teacher would call it

the underlying morality
of the law.

Me? I call it
selling your soul.

Because when
something makes you feel

that empty inside,

you might as well be dead.

And everything you had hoped
to gain is worthless.

If anyone ever tells you

that you don't have to work
hard to get what you want,

well, they're lying.

Because dreams need
to be chased and fought for.

And easy money,
it's never just that.
