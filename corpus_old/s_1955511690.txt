distance from the river about ... about 1 km.

If Bhima was out of there ...

he must be in the frozen water about 7 minutes.  It is impossible without diving equipment.

No.  That may be using techniques to hold your breath in yoga.

Do not forget, before we were born, we spent 9 months in the belly of our mother.

Not that humans could not survive in the water, it's just that we've forgotten our ability to do so.

World champion free divers can hold their breath over 8 minutes.

Mm-hmm. - Wow.

They all learn yoga.  - Yes.

Hi, Jack.  It has been a long time no see.

What's up?

A strong mind, and energy united into three formidable movement.

Punch-kick, elbow-knee, shoulder to hip, is 3 outer movements.

In luarjangkuan do not attack, attack with a clear, concise goals.

When in range, attack takes place only, and should always be perfect.

And I want to tell you.

The wolf was after me, let's Fight.

Hey, forget about him.  Let's go.

Hey, hey, you want to go?  Wait for me.

Hey, come on, wait for me.

Come on.

Do not worry, he can find his way home alone.

Xiaoguang, I ask you to keep them.
