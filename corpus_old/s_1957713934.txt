<i>My name</i>

[eerie instrumental]


a lot of people who

think somebody deals
with a haunted house,

especially nowadays,

they think
it's kind of cool, you know?

They're kind of like,
"It's awesome." You know?

"Everybody wants
a haunted house."

But when
you live in one,

it's not quite that way,
you know?

So, there must have been
a bit of a path of emotions

that have happened
over the years.

For-- for 20 years
we had things moving,

ghost activity,
doors opening.

And I accepted that.

â™ª


â™ª

[woman 1]
Okay, one more time.

Loud enough
for everybody to hear.

Can you please
whistle one more time?

[eerie whistle]

-[man 1] That's upstairs.
-[woman 2] Yup. You hear that?

[man 2] It hasn't
happen again, though.

-[man 1] Ask again, can you...

whistle one more time?

Loud.

[eerie whistle]

[indistinct speaking]

[man 1] That's bullshit.
That's upstairs.

-[woman 1] It's in that, um--
-[woman 2] It's only at...

[woman 1]
It's in that room, um--

It's in the crawlspace.

Can you whistle
one more time for me?


[woman 1]
Come on, [indistinct].

One more time, loud.

[eerie instrumental]

[ball thudding]

[people exclaim]


In the last, uh,
11 years, 12 years,

uh, I started seeing
light formations,

bizarre light formation.

â™ª

I remember that
one primary time that th--

I just said,
"That's it."

And that was, uh,
an area of, um,

a cylinder of daylight
in a pitch black room,

light that didn't diffuse,
that was it.

I didn't know
if it was just a fluke

that it happened
when I was in that room

or if it happened
because I was in that room.

So uh--

And then also
I did at the same time

have a strong feeling
that I was being observed.

So, I didn't know if
there was a conscious presence

observing that room
for some reason

or if, uh,
I was the target.

â™ª

It happened because
I was in that room.

-So, uh-- And then also I did--
-[disembodied voice]

â™ª


I do feel like it's still
learning to communicate.

I still feel like
we are teaching the spirits

in a--
in a weird way.

Do I think the house
is still learning?

It-- it appears to be

responding
to our requests.

So, we have a baseball,

I believe,
we have on the stairs--

I'm gonna put
our sweet little doll

here on the stairs.

We put a doll in
a blue dress on the stairwell.

We focus
solely on this object.

[patting on the carpet]

I see the doll for sure.

-[John] That's fine. That's--
-[Brad] Yeah, we're good.

That's mainly
what I want right there.

Yeah. That's good.

so you have John, Alice,

Brad in the house
investigating tonight.

We would love some
kind of visual representation

that you can
hear our voices

and you can
communicate with us.

And we continue
to ask over and over again

that any
intelligent entity that's here,

push that doll down.

There's been objects
that have moved off the stairs.

They've been pushed.

Can you
do that again?

Is that possible?

Push that little doll.

That little doll on the stairs,
just push it backwards for us.

â™ª

verbally asking you

to focus your energy
on that blue doll.

And eventually...

Amazingly,

the doll fell.

I ask that doll to fall.

-I do, too--
-I'd say that.

And I was reinforcin' it
and I said,

"John, we'd love
for you to have it fall

even now or even [indistinct]."

â™ª


â™ª

Oh, my God. [indistinct].

â™ª


â™ª

[ball thudding several times]

The ball's come down
the steps several times still.

And more recently,
it's actually seems like

the ball
has gotten more aggressive

when it
comes off the stairs,

even to the fact where
it will actually pivot almost

before it actually
just falls straight off.

â™ª

[ball bouncing]

[ball bouncing]

[ball bouncing]

[indistinct chatter]


-Oh, shit!
-[indistinct]

Oh, baby, oh, my God.

Look at that--
Look at my arms.

-[indistinct]
-So, which one?

-So, it's 12:57--
-[overlapping chatter]

Oh, look.
Let's come over here and look.

Uh, the keyboards play
by itself on command.

The organ, uh,
the piano playing on command,

responding with deep burst.

Uh, that-- that's been
something that's been new.

So, if you wanna walk over here
and play that keyboard,

or play that piano,
play it for us.

Just give us some kind of
sign that you're here,

you can hear our voice

and, uh,
you want to communicate with us

for a little bit of time.

So, if you could light that up,
that'd be fantastic.

Obviously, you know, you can
always turn the chandelier off

to get our attention.

Put a ball in this
little chair right here,

by doll and you know--

-[music playing]
-[Brad] Un-- Unbelievable.

What the--

Dude, tell me
what the odds are.

-[distant instrumental noises]
-[background chatter]

It's clearly Sabrina.


-[Brad] Oh, shit.
-[Alice] Holy shit. Yeah.

My music box is playing

-[woman] It is!
-[Alice] Oh.

-[woman] Did you hear music?
-[man] Yes, certainly.

It faded out.


[indistinct chatter]



Oh, look at this,
look at this, look at this!

Did you hear that?

Dude, that frickin' piano
just played by itself!

the major differences

with the chandelier
is not only

does it turn off now,

but we've actually captured

the chandelier
turning on by itself.

â™ª

We've been asking the--

the-- whatever's

shutting that light off

to turn back on.

And that hasn't happened
ever until recently.

All of a sudden
it starts happening.



Be back tomorrow.

So, if you
want to do something,

we-- we'll still be
able to see it.

If you want to
turn that light on,

we'll be
able to see it.

â™ª

I think that when we put
our energy into it

and we can express
the emotions that we have

and how important it is,
there's something

in this house
and these four walls

in this land
that's reacting to us,

and it wants to
help tell its story.

[bird chirps]

How does it make you feel
knowing that you have

this beautiful house,

um, but you literally

have to
live somewhere else?

Yeah, I remember thinking,
you know,

before that I might
probably need to sell it

because I'm doing
the upkeep and, you know,

and, um...

But I can't because I feel
emotionally attached to it.

Actually, my daughter
died September of 2020.

But I think
I've processed it pretty well

because she was
very ill and I knew that,

I knew that
she was dying.

And, you know,
and we had time--

We even
talked about it.

We had time to express
ourselves and, you know,

we had this-- she said,
"I'm-- I hope I die

before you do because,"
she said,

"I think you could handle it
better than I could."

[low background chatter]

You are
the best mom ever.


She had a lot of experiences,
and so did I,

and I really kind of hate
that they're gone

except just
in my own memory.

â™ª

Oh, look.
We really have this thing.

-[Steve] Looks good!
-[man] All right.

This is roll
A02 clip four,

this is
Ashley Pevey's interview.

-On marker.
-[click]

I'm Ashley Pevey.

I grew up in this house

and my mom
is Alice Jackson.

Do you believe in ghosts?

Oh, yeah,
I do believe in ghosts.

But I'm--
I'm real conflicted.

I can't decide
if I am

wanting
to embrace this,

or wanting to totally
reject it 'cause it's scary.

You know,
it is scary.

All these things
are [laughs].

They're just not normal.

I'm not really scared
because I grew up here.

I mean,
I'm not really scared.

But if something happens,

then I get scared.

What's my mom's name?

Oh!

Oh, my God. [laughing]

It's okay.

When I had
John Joseph, my child,

he was six months old

and we were sleeping
in that bed by ourselves.

This is
the weirdest thing.

Then he started crying.

And so I came in this kitchen
to get him some milk.

And when I got to the kitchen
to get him some milk,

I heard this ballroom music
in this living room.

And it was like,
very loud

and it was
just playin' and playin'.

And my mother-in-law
had come here

and she was upstairs.

And I thought,
"When she wakes up,

I'm goin' fuss at her
for having that ringtone

that plays
all night long."

But the whole time
I was down here getting milk,

there was ballroom music.

When I got up
in the morning,

she'd not left
her phone down here.

Her phone was upstairs.

But I heard that music.

I mean.

I wish somebody
could find an answer

but, um, I'm afraid of
what that answer might be.

You know?

Ashley's passing.

We lost her quickly.

And Alice
is so unique.

She processes some things

differently than
anybody that I know.

I'm actually fine
because I think

I've processed
all that ahead of time.

But I still think
that life continues.

And I really--
when I visualize her,

my natural sense
is that, um,

she's perfectly fine,
she's perfectly happy.

why we decided

to start
calling out Ashley's name

is because she knows
what we do here

as far as investigating.

Ashley did grow up here.
She loved Alice.

And, I mean, it makes sense.
She knows what we did.

-She liked what we did.
-[Brad] And of course,

we did this
with Alice's consent,

which is very important.

And the night
we did that,

we did get some strange,
direct responses

from the organ
over in the corner.

We were respectful, obviously.

And we said,
"Ashley, are you here?"

You know,
"Can you give us a sign?"

You know, "We would love
to communicate with you,

talk to you, let you know
Alice misses you."

And all of a sudden,

the organ piano
started booming

a deep bass hit.

Ashley?

This is John.

-[deep thumping]
-[Brad gasps]

-Oh my-- Oh my--
-[thumping continues]

Sounds like a heartbeat.

time we say Ashley.

Every time. [chuckling]

Ashley, is--
is this you?

[faint thumping]

absolute direct responses,

I mean,
it's unbelievable.

It wasn't a keystroke.

It was a thumping sound
coming from the organ.

[thumping continues]

Thank you.
Keep doing that for us.

That's a direct response.
Thank you.

[deep thumping]

Turn it off. Or like--

[thumping continues]


Yeah. There's only...

I'm just curious
because whenever

we all go back there,
it stops.

My phone's down. Off.

-[Olivia] Lights off--
-[Brad] Chandelier shut off.

Later on we found out,
or I found out,

that Ashley
is who gave Alice

that piano, organ.

We got
an organ in the house.

And, uh,
we had heard, you know,

my daughter
gave it to me

because she had heard of
a lady in town was selling it

because
she said it was haunted.

And she was trying to
sell it for $150.

Well,
nobody bought it.

And so then she said
she'd sell it for $75.

I told Ashley
I would take it, you know.

And so, uh,
I went up there

and got it
and it didn't do anything.

But when John and Brad tried
to get the organ to play,

they called her name
and that's when it played.

[faint thumping]

There was two right there.

It did, "Dum-dum."
You-- 'Cause you went...

Do I think it's Ashley?

Again, it's speculation.

But I think it's possible
because of the amount

of direct responses
that I got.

It's not crazy to think
that this would be a place

if Ashley was
to come and visit.

Now, I'm not saying
that I necessarily

think that was her.

But I know that
she would do that if she could.

â™ª

[indistinct chatter]

Obviously, we know that
the land is probably

the heartbeat
of the supernatural things

that are happening here.

Say hello, John Bullard.

What's happenin'?

John Bullard's in the house.

is a beach and this.

Amy Bullard's in the house.

Seeing the research tent
pop up is cool

because it's nice
to have a base camp.

It makes it
easier for us

to help document things
in the house.

So to see this tent,
that's things we dream

of being able
to have access to

as paranormal investigators.

-[John] In here.
-[Brad] This is awesome.


One of
the most exciting things

is the
ground-penetrating radar.

Alice has been wanting
to do that for forever.

with Century Mapping.

We combine ground-penetrating
radar with GPS.

We map
underground infrastructure

from cemeteries
to municipalities,

anything that's underground.

If there was
a burial, like,

let's say a body
was buried in a shroud.

Um, body decomposes
really quickly...

leaving basically
a pocket of air.

Yeah, so. All right.
So you see this?

This could be just
a change in the type of soil.

I mean,
it could be from--

obviously we have
a lot of clay here.

But in your estimation,
it would probably

just be soil related

and not like
a man-made structure

or burial,
that sort of thing?

-Not a burial.
-Okay.

Not a burial,
but I mean, could it be

something that
was man-made, yeah.

[ominous instrumental]

[machinery rattling]

â™ª

So these are--

These are potential burials.

It's not
a lot to see.

But you can see here

there's a beginning
and an end.

-Yes.
-[Benton] This is about

four to five feet.

And so everywhere
that I have a red flag,

it's very similar.

There's something there.

Is that typically
what you would see

if you were doing
that sort of work--

For an unmarked grave? Yeah.

-Okay.
-There's certainly...

I mean,
so far I've found

10 areas that...

some of them
could be unmarked graves.

-Wow.
-Yeah.

-Oh, my gosh.
-[Benton] Could be.

Ten, huh? Whoo.

[pensive instrumental]

-[Steve] Alice? Hey.
-[Alice] Hey.

Alice, this is Carolyn.
Uh, Carolyn. Uh, Alice.

-How are you?
-[Alice] Nice to meet you.

So I brought in a geophysicist
named Carolyn

with background
in astrophysics to really

look into what could be
creating that light phenomena.

Because a lot of things
can be explained

by what's happening
environmentally

and not something paranormal.

I'm delighted to have
somebody to tell that story to

who would
understand possibly.

My name
is Carolyn Streiff

and I am
a geophysicist

that specializes
in near-surface

geophysics acquisition
and analysis.

The ERI
is a very useful tool

because
we already have known

value ranges

for different
sediment and rock units.

I could give some
information now for Alice

to hopefully be able
to start coming to some sort of

resolution
of what is happening here.

a lot of theories

as to what
could be creating the phenomena

Alice is experiencing.

It has to do
with earthquakes

and maybe even volcanoes

and fault lines
and blue shale

that's underneath
the ground here.

There are
different types of rocks

that when
you heat them or cool them,

they will
have a voltage.

If you compress them,
if you get a charge on to them.

Also, when you do different
mechanical processes,

they will illuminate.

There is

an actual
scientific effect

that creates light
from rubbing quartz.

And because we know

that Alice has sand
and shale underneath her home,

there is quartz
in sand and shale.

So, could
something be causing

some of these light effects
that Alice is seeing?

What if something
is affecting Alice's house

momentarily because of
charges in the ground

that could be occurring?

Having a geophysicist
come do research here

on the land is--
is huge.

exciting anytime you have

a person of science background
that's willing to reach out

to the paranormal
side of things.

You don't see that.

I--
At least I haven't.

I haven't seen much of that
at all in this field.

â™ª

-Hey, Carolyn.
-Hey.

You said you had
some information to share.

This line we did

that passed by the tree
that the dog hit at.

So, there's something else
in the ground there.

That is not soil,
that is something.

And it's not
a tree root.

It's too big
to be a tree root.

So, what you're saying
basically is the electricity

goes through the soil.

-[Carolyn] Mm-hmm.
-[Steve] And here

it is not conducting

because
there is a void there.

Yeah, it's having a hard--
it's having a harder time

going through the soil.

-[Steve] Wow.
-I'll tell you something.

This is
extremely similar

to when I did
an old section of a cemetery

and the body
was no longer decomposing

so there was no longer
any signature of the body.

But the fill
that was above the body

was still
resistive enough to be shown,

which is what
we're exactly seeing here.

And there's
now fresh soil on top.

So, that's
a loose sort of fill,

as if somebody
had a shovel or something.

It would be.

It would be, yeah,
where somebody dug something

and then filled
the hole back up.

There's something
going on there.

This is great.

Thank you
for all this hard work.

I think we may
have to dig there

and just see what--

what is there.

[wind whooshing]

[night din]

[owl hooting]

[indistinct chatter]

Somebody what?

â™ª

[door slamming]

Copy that. Copy that.
Can you get your camera up?

-Yeah.
-[Benton] Thank you.

Can you po--
Can you start rolling?

-[man] Yeah.
-[Benton] Hey, Steve?

â™ª

Yeah, we're comin' out front.

â™ª

[night din]

Well-- wha-- what happened?
Why-- why are you--

Okay.

So.

I was like, kind of looking
over here the entire time.

All of a sudden,

out of--
out of nowhere, I just saw

somebody.

So if I'm
standing over here.

I'll show you exactly
where the person walked.

But they were definitely
not heading into the tent.

So, I expected to see somebody
walk out the other side.

And there
is nobody over here.

There's nobody here,
nobody turned around.

-Okay.
-So, you were--

I'm just having a--
This is just too wild.

Sorry. Yes. Okay.

So, during your, just research

on your lines,

you thought you saw
somebody walking over here?

And you came over
and there's nobody here?

And I just
happened to see

as I'm facing towards

this area of the yard,

I saw somebody walking,

uh, toward-- I saw somebody
walking towards the tent.

I mean, I don't want to
put any more sort of--

not fear,
but I guess maybe anxiety

into the situation
for you.

But there are many,
many reports

of an apparition
being seen back here.

Uh,
the neighbor has claimed

to see
an apparition back here.

We did have a psychic named,
uh, Jill come here

and she drew
the image of a gentleman

that she saw
in the backyard here.

Uh, so,
the gentleman I saw,

without like-- I--
the thing that drew me

to seeing this person walking
for just a brief second

was the fact that
he was wearing white.

-But--
-[Steve] Carolyn came here

as a total nonbeliever
of the paranormal

and had an experience
that changed her mind.

And she's honestly
a little bit concerned

that the science community

is going to
look down on her.

They're going to
raise their eyebrow.

But, you know,
that's scary for me

because I wanted to
completely explain

a lot of the phenomena
so I could tell Alice, like,

what you're experiencing
is actually A, B, C and D.

But the geophysicist
had an experience.

Uh, we've had
another person, Erin,

who lived next door,
grew up next door,

who said she saw
a full body apparition

not only in the same location
as the geophysicist

but also the description
was pretty close.

A male
in a white shirt.

â™ª

I saw at the door,

he seemed
to be about my height.

Very young.
Early twenties. Late teens.

He was wearing a white shirt
and he had dark hair

and it was slicked back
and real strong eyes.

I didn't feel like a presence
or anything when I was here,

cutting grass, it was
completely sprung up on me.

And he looked
so real.

He was looking
this direction.

And I came around the corner
and he turned his head

and looked right at me,
and I looked at him.

And his--
his eyes were so intense.

It wasn't anything li--
the ghostly,

fuzzy, foggy look that you
think you see in movies and TV.

He was completely solid.

the story about

seeing the full body apparition
on the back land.

Yes, I remember that
because I was at work

and she called me and I mean,
you could tell she was--

she was
so nervous, excited.

And she told me,
you know, such detail.

I mean,
there's things that I think

draw us
out there a lot, you know?

Whether
it's the door opening

or the EVP,
we got one time that said,

"I'm in the woods."

I think that
we really should focus a lot

on the uh--
on the backyard.

And I think that's the
heartbeat of what's going on.

[wind whooshes]


-[Jill] Hello.
-[Alice] Jill.

-It's good to see you.
-[Jill] Hey,

good to see you too.

I'm excited that,
uh, Jill Morris,

who came last time,

is coming back
because she did have a lot of

accurate statements
and intuitive things

that were borne out
by things that happened.

There is a female
that I'm not familiar with

that has been
coming here

and she brings
with her a lot of music.

Does that
mean anything to you?

It does.

And I kept
hearing music

that almost
sounded like a music box.

That's exactly what we hear.

She was standing--

like I was here
and she was standing

more towards the door,
so whatever this area

where the table
is over there--

And she was just
twirling around,

pulling all of these
beautiful lights in

with this beautiful music
playing in the background.

What I did
is the name Rich came up,

then Richardson, and I'm like,
"What does this mean?"

There is a waltz that goes back
to the state of South Carolina.

Does--
do you have any community--

Anything to do
with South Carolina?

Yes,
that's where they're from.

We have a genealogy book
that traces the family back--

This, for crying out loud.

Then we have
this spirit.

And I call him
the Reverend.

I wouldn't say
he was evil by any means.

He's just
a dark person.

He just seemed to be
when he was alive,

which carries over...

angry.

They were-- this area,
this land may have been his

or he had something to do
with this land at one time.

I'm just
going to say it.

It's almost like,
don't find out about me.

Like, it's because
it's an exposure.

He was not a nice person
and I do think

he had a hand in
what happened in the backyard.

Okay.

[birds chirping]

So, this
is the general area.

Just going to be honest.

He was taken here.
I think he was hung here.

There was
a debt to be paid

and he--
he was killed.

It's not that
he stole something.

And that's kind of
what his message is right now

speaking with you,

is to know he's not
going to disrespect you.

It's-- he wants people to
understand he was a good man.

But I think the reason
he is really strong here

is because
this is where he passed.

That's my opinion.

But he tends
to hang out here.

I don't work with psychics,

you know, that much.

But my job here is
to service the investigation,

to service what Alice wants,
to facilitate that.

So if the team
wants another psychic here,

you know, we're going to
bring one in for them.

And I thought
it was important to make sure

that is a psychic
who has never been

to the house before.


-[Alice] Oh. Hello.
-[Sam] Hello.

-How are you? I'm Alice.
-Hey, I'm Sam.

-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, nice to meet you.

Come in.

â™ª

So, here we are.

Yeah,
so, I'll tell you, like, I--

Like, as soon as
I came on the property,

I definitely started
having anxiety issues.

So when it comes
to my abilities

as a clairvoyant and as
a light of trance medium,

I've learned to kind of
separate my emotions

from the emotions
of the spirits

that I'm communicating with.

So, I came in
with my guard up.

I-- I did feel
not welcomed

when I first walked up
to the property.

So, I was feeling
sort of the--

the energy, the chaos.

So, what I've been picking up
on for the past few days

is there's
an older gentleman,

uh,
who wants to communicate.

And he definitely
is the type of person that,

uh, very cranky.

So when I was coming in,
he was like,

basically telling me
to get out.


[Southern accent]
"This is my land.

This is my land!"

And, um,

I think that we're going to
see on the property

that there
is definitely, uh,

signs that
he was on the property.

This was not his house.
His house was out back.

Now he has stuff
in the back there--

He has secrets
in the back.

Um,
and I hope that we can

maybe uncover
those secrets.

But he's hiding something.

Whoa.

Well, I can see if--
if anybody

has tried to stay
in this room,

like, why they wouldn't
want to stay here.

All right.
I'm going to go there.

Okay.

Okay. [sighs]

All right.
What do you want from Alice?

[tense music]

All right,
I'm seeing, um--

He wants you to dig.
Uh, dig out in the back.

Okay, um, he's showing me
that he wants you to dig.

Um, you-- there's something
hidden down there.

I'm getting chills.

My back and my neck

is being touched right now.

Um.

Well, when I was connecting
with the spirit

of the older man,
he kept saying,

"Dig, dig, dig."

All right, sir, so I want you
to tell me where to dig.

Give me a sign.

All right,
can you show me where--

Uh,
where you want to dig?

I guess give me
some animal indication

or some sort.

All right.
So I'm going to keep walking.

Okay, that's interesting.

â™ª

All right, so I'm gett--
I'm getting-- [chuckles]

I'm getting a flashback
to someone getting,

like,
an attack over here.

So there was
some kind of--

[birds chirping]

â™ª

All right,
so just so you-- I mean,

I'm going--
I'm just going to go there.

-[Alice] Yeah.
-Okay.

Um, so there was
definitely tensions going on.

Um,
I think that there was--

there was an attack,
maybe even, uh, something

like a lynching
of some sort

that could have
happened back here too.

[animals
screeching in distance]

The animals
responding to me is--

means that
that's the truth.

[screeching continues]

-[Jill] Jill.
-[Sam] Nice to meet you, Sam.

It's nice to meet you, Sam.

So, you've had
a chance to kind of

get your own vibe,
what's going on?

I feel like that the land
is stained with blood.

There's something out there

that we should
probably investigate.

I am hearing

a really
super pitch high frequency.

-Oh, me too. Yeah.
-[Jill] Okay.

ever heard that before?

I know you said static and
I've heard that here before.

Yeah, I heard--
when you said you heard it

in that back room,
I did, too.

You want to go check it out?

-Yeah.
-[Jill] Be careful

because
this is new for me.

And see,
it picks up in here.


So, this is new.

And I was trying to
get my bearings.

It does seem
over the bed.

-Yeah, it's over here.
-[Jill] It's over the be--

It's like super loud
over here.

Over there. Yeah.

I will say this thing

wants to attach to one of us.

There is a male

and that's
what he is trying to do.

And it's odd you say that
because I get it

right outside the house,

whereas
the last time I was here,

he was in the house
and he was very unpleasant.

Was he the murderer?

Do you think
that he's the one--

something to do with it.

And it's spending, what,
a couple hours out in the back.

It really gave me

a good chance
to pick up on--

there is a spirit
of an enslaved person.

Oh, my gosh.
Okay, you're right.

That's what
I was picking up too.


You actually said lynching.

-[Sam] Yeah.
-Yeah.

And that's--
that's what I picked up on.

And there's a--
I'll show you that.

You got-- You did?

Okay,
this is giving me chills.


-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

Yeah.

Do you want to take a moment?

Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

I just--
I sort of trusted myself

because I did see that,
but I was just like,

I didn't
want to go there, you know?

Because it's so horrific.

Like, who would do that

to somebody else, you know?

Working with Jill
on this collaboration

was awesome for me

because I was able to
get a confirmation

for the things
that I was picking up.

He-- he is--
his spirit is very grateful.

So just know that.

I want him to know and I want--

I want you
to know that

his story
has been heard

and he's no longer
a man without a voice.

He now has a voice
and he can speak freely

and hopefully
he can move on to Heaven.

-This is good, Alice.
-[Jill] Yeah, yeah,

it feels so whole...
wholesome.

-Healing?
-[Sam] Healing, that's it.

[night din]

[digital whining]

I wanna do the full spectrum.

-[John] Yup.
-[Amy] I'm gonna go in there?

Oh, my God.

-Where?
-[John] Just on that chair.

And then
just do some--

just ask a question,
see if you can

get the [indistinct]
to go off.

And you know me.

I've been coming
to this house for years.


Hi. [sighs]

[under breath]
Oh, my God.

Can you
do that again?

You know
I don't like this room.


Sounds like [indistinct].


It's this one.

[faint beeping]

Are you the spirit who made

all that light

happen with Alice

when she was
in this room?

-[beeping]
-[John] Put this one there.

I know it's a lot
we're asking of you

and it takes
a lot of energy

to be able
to communicate.

But I really want you
to try really hard.

[low tense music]

All right.
We're going to walk out.

â™ª


â™ª

So, Alice
is here with us tonight.

And I know y'all really
like having Alice come in.

Can you all
do something to show

that you're happy
Alice is here?

What we want to do tonight
is engage with you

and understand who you are,
what your name is

and why you're attached
to the house and the property.

â™ª

[metallic rustling]

Is anyone here
a victim of the fire?

on this property?

the fire in this town?

Do you understand
that this house,

this-- this property,

where we're
standing at right now,

this is Alice's home.

You're not supposed
to be here.

[quiet rattling]


-What was that?
-Did-- What happened?

Did the light dim?

I mean, something dimmed.

Oh, I just thought
something dimmed.

I thought
the room dimmed.

[tense music]

your voice better than anybody.

So, any--
any, anything you have.

Ask. Just--

Okay,
is there anybody here

who's never been
here before?

Can you speak
so that we can hear you?

-[strong blipping]
-[Brad] There you go. Ooh!

That's pretty interesting.


That was a pretty big hit, too.

Three
of the lights lit up.

We appreciate
any form of communication

-that you do.
-[strong blipping].

-Like that.
-[Brad] That's crazy.

We're trying
to uncover who you are...

and how
we can help you.


[eerie instrumental]

Should probably all sit down.


that it's not going off

now with Amy
right next to it.

Walk over there again.

Walk towards
the back door, Amy.

[Amy quietly] Okay.

You want her to go outside?

-If you want her to go outsi--
-[beeping]

-[Sabrina] Oh, look.
-[Brad] Look how

far away she is.

Look how
far away she is.


[door creaking]

[night din]

All right, let's--
let's-- let's transition.

Let's leave this here.

Let's leave this room pot
here in this chair,

and we'll take
the full spectrum camera.

And we'll sit out
in the backyard.

[night din]

â™ª

That's a very old tree.

I thought I was...


Right there.

[strong blipping]

We're trying to figure out

if there is a body
buried in the ground--

[bird squawks]

[night din]

If you're buried here
on the property,

can you come up
to this device

and make it
light up?

Why is that cat digging?

It's interesting.

All right, y'all,
let's wrap it up

and let's head back
into the house.

That does not include
the kitty cat.

No, cats stay here.

Sure that cat's not hungry.

[Amy chuckles] Yeah.

â™ª

all of these red flags, right?

That red flag,
the red flags, see 'em?

Those are all
spots that

the ground-penetrating radar

detected that
there could be

individual bodies
or burials.

-Really?
-Yeah. Yep.

Um, and even there,
that red flag right there.

Now, the geophysicist

found spots right here.

She said that
there could be a body.

-[Alice] Oh, my goodness.
-Right here.

So--

Just when it hits me,

the bodies is the most
intriguing thing to me.

But it's-- so it's crazy,
so you're telling me that

each red flag
is a potential body?

Yeah. Yeah.

We had
a geophysicist come here

and she marked
some places that she thought

were possible burial sites.

We had ground-penetrating
radar come

and he marked places
that he thought

were possible unmarked graves.

You know, doing research
with Mary Alice,

it does seem that
this property could have been

part of all
of these properties, honestly,

part of
the original graveyard.

And that everything
else was moved

but they just
left the bodies.

You know, that--
that is a possible scenario.

So I wanted to see
if Alice and the team

wanted to dig there.

And that,
ethically, you know,

that's a bit of a gray area.

You know,
should you shouldn't you?

But I thought
it would be important

for a few different reasons.

One, if we found something,
we could offer proper burial.

We could do things
that could possibly get Alice

to feel better in terms of
the phenomena happening here.

And maybe show Alice
that it is something

that is human in nature,
that it could have been

a person that was once alive.

And it's not
as scary as it could be

if it was something that
she couldn't put a face to.

If we did find any bodies

or any remnants of
an old foundation or anything,

that there was
a structure there at one point,

it would make her
feel a little bit better.

If it's bodies
that's more modern.

There's a chance there may be
buried with personal items...

and a metal detector
could possibly pick up

buttons or rings.

-It's just an idea.
-[Steve] No, it's a good idea.

Actually, that's a great idea.

Because if you
do find artifacts, right?

Like anything that looks like
it belonged to a family...

we can use those items
as trigger objects.

Here's what we need to do
is get the excavator over here

so we can start
getting it into the ground.

And Alice, I can probably
use your metal detector.

Yeah, you can.
I still have it.


Brad, we'll get you
metal detecting

and I'll go
get shovels and gloves.

-[Brad] Let's get it!
-Yeah. Let-- let's get started.


[upbeat strings & piano
instrumental]

no other location in the world

that investigates
this hard, man.

â™ª


Hold on tight. All right.

â™ª


â™ª

[Alice speaking indistinctly]

â™ª

Even though I've lost
the house to my personal use,

I do feel like
I've done the right thing

by just
opening it up to investigators.

I feel like at least,
you know, someone's getting

some benefit out of it,
which will be justified

in that something
really will be found.

[street din]

[eerie music playing]

â™ª

Hey, buddy.

-What's up, man?
-Hey, man.


I've known Dustin
for many, many years.

And he's a great investigator.
He's a good friend.

He's one
of the most kind people

I've ever met
and worked with.

I'm Dustin Perry.
I'm a paranormal researcher.

I've been investigating
for about 24 years.

I've traveled internationally.

I've had opportunity
to investigate

in 27 different countries.

The first impression
of arriving at Alice's house

is it's very unassuming.

But I've learned
over the years,

the places that look
very unassuming often have

some interesting
activity going on.

-[Steve] Dustin Perry.
-[Dustin] Hey Alice.

-How are you?
-[Alice] Hey! How are you?

I like to hug people.

Yeah, well this--
yeah this is Mississippi.

-We do too.
-[Dustin] Alice's house

is very unique
in the fact that

there's no
other place like it

in terms of
the amount of time

it's been allowed
to be investigated.

For me, the paranormal
is really a spiritual journey.

However, I try to look
at things scientifically

to disprove
and also to offer evidence

so people can understand.

â™ª

My name is Elizabeth Saint.

I have a background
in electrical engineering.

I've been investigating
the paranormal 10 years?

But it's always been
a part of my life.

-Hey, how's it going?
-Good. How are you?

-[Elizabeth] Good. I'm good.
-[Steve] Oh, man! Thank you.

Elizabeth,
I've known for quite some time.

I've actually
never worked with her

but I know her background
in electrical engineering.

I know that she
likes to build equipment.

So, I thought it was
really important to have

somebody come in
that can build equipment

and tailor it
to certain experiences,

to certain types of phenomena.

Having a background
in electrical engineering

has actually been
really advantageous

when I go
on my investigations.

-Hi!
-[Alice] I'm Alice.

-I'm Elizabeth.
-[Alice] It's nice to meet you.

-It's great to meet you, too.
-[Alice] Yeah, come on in.

at things a little differently.

Like, it's exciting
when you have an experience

but there's
always this side of me

that is looking
for another explanation.

I don't know a lot about you,
of your equipment

and electrical stuff
and all that.

But I think it's fascinating.

I would like to see

how it works
and see what you get.

I think it's great
that Alice is open

to the possibilities here
of what could be going on.

You know, a lot of times you go
to a residential location

and they already
have it in their mind

what they think is going on.

It doesn't leave a lot of room
for finding out real answers.

They're so
wrapped up in the idea

that this is the haunted place
and this happens

and that happens.

And you can't possibly
show them anything else.

Where here, Miss Alice
and the team just want to know

what's causing these things.

Is it natural?

Is it some
supernatural phenomenon?

Or-- It's nice
that it's not like, "This is--

There's a portal,
there's a demon," and like,

you know,
it goes down that-- that road.

Here, it's not like that.

People are just so excited
to get the evidence.

And I am with you
100% on that.

Like,
I am also very excited

but let's have it be real

so that we feel
better about the work

that we're doing
in this field.

So this has
an accelerometer inside

that pretty much is a center
that monitors any movement.

[long beeping]

Do any of these
balls ever move?

The ones that are back here?
Yeah?

Just--

Yeah, when they're--
Just the stairwell?


have moved, too?

Well, if-- if-- Whatever
we asked, those--

-Hello!
-[Dustin] Hey, man!

-How's it going?
-[Brad] Hey, hey!

-How you doing? Dustin.
-Man.

-[Dustin] Good to see you.
-[Brad] Good to see you, man.

-What's up?
-Nice to meet you.

-Nice to meet you as well--
-Hey!

-[Elizabeth] Hey!
-How are you?

-[Elizabeth] Elizabeth.
-I know who you are.

-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

Great to see you guys.

about Brad and John

is, honestly,
they're so compelled

to find Alice answers.

When it comes to the equipment
in the paranormal community,

it's very, very limited.

You have to understand, like,

these are items that are
being mass produced for sale.

You know?

They're not sent data sheets
on what kind of sensors

are involved
inside the equipment.

You know, I kind of feel
one of the biggest problems

with paranormal research
is that everyone's always,

as I say,
singing from the same hymnal.

You know,
we get all these devices

and what do we do
to make new ones?

We just put
a new light on it.

You see some lights go off,
you hear an alarm go off.

And you're like, "Ooh, ah,"
like, "There's something here."

But that's not the case.

You know, like,
there's so many other factors

to take
into consideration.

Or we combined, you know--

"Now it has
two features in one."

It's like,
but it's really nothing new.

It's the same thing.

And I think that...

there has to be expansion

outside of the community
to kind of understand

the tools that they're using.

And to also understand

all the false positives

that they are getting
in the process.

Coming to the house,
I did want to create

and-- and kind of customize
things that made sense

to what you guys
experience here, you know?

And everything
that you documented before.

And, you know, I--

I like to
sometimes do things

that other people
wouldn't necessarily do

just because
if we don't try it,

we won't know
what's going to work.

I have great respect
for Elizabeth Saint,

having known her
over the years,

having traveled from,
you know,

conventions
and things together

and knowing that Elizabeth
goes out of her way

to make specific equipment

like the light anomaly
that's here.

This is the-- the light sensor
I told you about.

So maybe if we do see
any light anomalies,

we might be able to--
It'll let us know

by the color
that it shines, essentially.

She developed something
to look for those lights

and then to try to figure out
which color lights it is.

And it lights up responsively.

And the most famous thing,

the ball moving
down the stairs.

So she makes
a ball that she can

measure any slight movement.

So, what's
unique about this is, um,

I call it
the comm sphere.

And it actually
communicates with my phone.

The Y x or Z axis and it
goes right to her software.

And it sends her an alert.

So it'll show me values

in the X, Y, Z direction,
if it moves.

To have the passion to say,

"I'm doing this case.

What's the type of activity?

What can I make
specifically that will speak

to trying to measure
that type of activity?"

I mean, that's--
I have trouble

getting on the Wi-Fi sometimes.

She's like,
light years above that.

So, I've known Dustin Perry
for a few years now.

And we've
always seen each other like,

on the road or,
you know,

the--
the paranormal community

is very, like,
tight knit community,

so we've always
run into each other.

But I've never
had the opportunity

to actually work with him,
so I'm really excited

that I'll be
able to do that here.


She seems to really
embrace what's going on here,

which is odd because she also
seems to be afraid of it.

And all I want to do
is go upstairs and to the left.

Ever since
I've walked in the house.

-Really?
-[Dustin] Yeah.

When I first
walked into the house,

I even told her that.

When I first walked in,

I was immediately
drawn to that door frame.

Yeah, yeah, for sure.

Just based on
years of experience

and feeling
drawn to places

like that seems
to be the place.

-[Elizabeth] Me too. Yeah.
-[Dustin] So.

Just a couple
of trip hazards here.


â™ª

because we have

the three mirrors
like you said here.

And then,
there's another right there.

I was just trying to think
for light purposes too

but if the door's closed,

she does have this-- What?

Is this is a balcony area?

I--

But there's no road there.

So, you're
not getting any, like,

car light
coming in through there?


Because I was just trying
to think for bouncing light.

We are close
to the road in the front.


a-- a walk-in?

What's with all the mirrors?

There's one on the floor.

I don't know.
There is a crawlspace.

-[Elizabeth] Oh, is there?
-[Dustin] Yeah.

I-- I can't really open it.
Stay right there.

Do you know
if anyone's ever been?

No one's gone
in the crawlspace?

We have to go
in the crawlspace.

have to go in the crawlspace.

-[Elizabeth] Is there asbestos?
-[Dustin] Uh, no. That's uh--

That's pink.

-[Elizabeth] Oh, yeah.
-[Dustin] Yeah. Oh.


just standing up there.

[Elizabeth gasps] It is.

Like, it just felt like
something, like, grazed me

and I just
looked down and everything...


feels like more is going.

It's like you're about
to get electrocuted.

-[Dustin chuckles] Right.
-[Elizabeth] But right before,

you know,
you get struck by lightning

-a lot of times your--
-Yeah.

-[Elizabeth] Hair will--
-Yeah, it all did.


-That's odd.
-[Elizabeth] It's weird

that no one's
been in there.

For sure.

Jeez. I'm breaking things.

It doesn't go
too far back but I mean,

we could definitely
sit in there and do,

like an EVP session
or something.

-Yeah, I think we should.
-[Dustin] Yeah.


If there's anybody here
that could hear our voice,

are you able to communicate
by just knocking for us?

[knock-knock-knock]

Can you do
something like that?

How 'bout in here?

[knock-knock-knock]

[faint knock]

you heard that, right?

It sounded
like it was in this--

-It sounded inside.
-[Dustin] Yeah.

[ominous music]

Is that a woman's voice?

-[Elizabeth] I-- I heard a--
-I heard a knock.

It sounded like it was
maybe like, a woman's voice

or something
right before it.


This happens quick.

I think we get some good
starting points of ideas

in terms of trying to do
a focused investigation.

This area
has already been pretty hot.

-[Brad] Yeah.
-We've had knocks and response.

So, if we do
a session in the crawlspace.

-Uh-huh.
-Use your ion charger,

throw that in there for a while
and then repeat the session.

Right.
And see if there's a change.

-Yeah.
-I think that's smart.

I used to have an ion generator
in my bedroom when I was a kid.

It was like an air purifier
and ion generator.

I don't know.
My mom bought it on QVC.

-[Elizabeth] Okay.
-But it was-- it was nice.

With ion motors,
it's very interesting.

Like the one I have,

you can make it
so it's producing positive

but you can also make it so
it's producing negative ions.

And it's going to have
a different feeling

and a different effect.

I did bring an ion motor,

but, um, the one I have
is pretty serious.

Yeah? I love it!

"I don't want to brag
but the ion motor I have--"

It's little
but it packs a punch.

You're going to
go out that way?

-[Brad] Yes.
-[Dustin] Or not.

[Elizabeth laughs]

will go to the garage?

I don't know
which door's which.

It's like a labyrinth.

show already.

I go here, there.

[Brad chuckles]

[night din]


You guys
digging out here?

Wait, stop for a second.

-Do you hear that?
-[faint whistling]

-[Alice] What was it?
-Someone's whistling.



[Dustin whistling]

That's what I heard.

-[Dustin] Well, let me get--
-There, there, there.

-[ghostly whistling]
-You don't hear that?

-[Dustin] I heard it.
-[Elizabeth] You did?


-It was the same tune.
-[Dustin] Yeah.


-Why that tune?
-[Dustin] I know, right?

-FrÃ¨re Jacques.
-It is FrÃ¨re Jacques.

something moving back there?

noise to my right--

like someone's walking.

just ran across there.

[receding footsteps]

I-- I saw something go
like straight across.

[ominous music]

person or what?


over there a couple times.

one thing I will say, though,

despite all the kind of
touch and go, little bits of,

of activity even inside.

Like, I don't know,
for me personally,

I don't feel
anything that feels like,

threatening or-- or--
or angry in any way.

she said all these [indistinct]

they like thinking
she sees people.

She gets out there,
there's nobody there.

There's no reading's,
like, out here,

but out here
we had this strange whistling.

-[Dustin] Yeah.
-Sounded like people were

having conversation back there.

Also a female voice.

like, footsteps, it seems like.

You know,
coming back tomorrow

with more equipment,

I will be curious to see

if it responds the same.

I'm thrilled that you came,
both of you.

Thank you for having us.

We appreciate it.

Oh, yeah.
It was our-- our pleasure.

get to meet Jacques.

We have a new person
on the team.

Your little mascot.

dig holes and stuff.

Dig and fill them.

At least he's courteous.

that's very nice.

[purposeful piano instrumental]

â™ª


a small town
in central Mississippi.

Maybe you've
never heard of it.

It has history.

Some dark history as well.

There were outlaws here.

Bad men, charlatans,

those who would
steal your money.

Those who would
take your life.

And like most good stories,
this story happens

long ago in a place
far away.

Western South Carolina.

A ma'am named Nancy Lusk.

Her middle name was Agnes.

And I believe
she actually went by Agnes.

She was born
in a time of war.

She came of age
in the events

leading up
to the American Revolution.

She was 19 years old.

She warred-- married
a man named William Steen.

William Steen
will actually fight

in the American Revolution

at the Battle
of Kings Mountain.

So about 1810, William decides
to take his family West

into the new
Mississippi territory,

where the land
is rich and fertile.

During this interval,

one of these mules
comes up missing.

So he goes out
looking for his mule

and he never returns.

It was believed
that he might have been killed

by the Native Americans

who still claim
this land as their own.

But nobody
really knows for certain.

But nonetheless,
he never returns.

And so Agnes is now
the matriarch of the family

and she and the rest
for grown children

push on
and complete the journey.

And they settle here.

And since they settle,
first settlers,

it becomes known
as Steen's Creek.

Uh, by the turn
of the 20th century,

this area has been known
as Steen Creek for a while.

And there's
a new rail line coming through.

They're going
to build a railroad track

from the Gulf Coast up into
the capital city of Jackson,

a few miles
north of here.

Uh, one gentleman,
Mr. Ellis,

will donate
the land for the depot

on one condition.

He wants that depot
named after his wife.

Willing to take the free land,
whatever they can,

the depot is actually named
Florence Depot

rather than Steen's Creek.

Most of American
history and again,

the history
of the world is made--

It's been a man's world.

The men take the credit
and are the kings.

They're the soldiers,
they're the ones that go off

and everybody
raves about them.

But back there in--
Behind them in the shadows

have always been the women

making sure
the farm is still running,

making sure there's food
still heading out to the front,

making sure the hard
decisions are being made.

The hand that rocks
the cradle rules the world.

And now it's 1905.

We're going
to build a city.

What are we going to call it?

And I suspect,
I don't know for certain,

but I suspect
by this time a lot of people

had started referring to it

by the name of the Depot,
Florence.

And the City
of Florence was born.

Founded by a woman
and named for a woman.

â™ª


[both laughing]

I, uh-- I have
these for you.

Um, thank you for making time

to meet with us again.

We've had
really incredible researchers

do a deep dive
with some of the Steen history.

Florence husband, C Ellis...

some old photographs.

[Mary Alice] Gave the land
to the railroad company.

The Steen family is a very--
Well, the Steen name

is a very,
very well known name

in the Florence area.

In fact,
there's a lot of streets named

Steen this, Steen that,

Steen Creek.


or Mrs. Steen

has anything to do
with the haunting here?

I don't know if the Steens
have anything to do

with the haunting here.

We have had
some EVP's with Henry.

Henry Steen is somebody
that I've called out,

uh, to several times.

We've captured
an EVP voice recording

that did say Henry,
obviously.

And Henry Steen
is one Steen families.

what your name is?

[male voice]<i> Henry.</i>

You know,
there is definitely a--

a pattern of the male,
whether it's the apparition,

whether it's the voice.

â™ª

Hearing Henry
kind of validates

and kind of puts
things in perspective.

So that's possible.

There is a lot of Henrys
in the world, though.

[birds tweeting]

[dog barks]


That's interesting.

It's not metal
but it's fabric of some kind.

So...

I found this while the detector
picked up the metal.

What's interesting
even more to me,

this looks like
it's some kind of fabric.

[determined music]

It's really kind--
It's really sensitive.

Oh. Oh, yeah.


[speaking over each other]


[motor whirring]


But what's intriguing about,
about what this object is

is the fact
that it was so deep.

does it feel like [indistinct]?

Oh, it's even got a--
Oh, my goodness. What's it say?

something fancy on it.

Oh, it's got letters on it.

Because it is [indistinct].

Right there underneath.


There you go, Sabrina.

[beeping continues]

like a fake.


â™ª


-It's definitely metal.
-[Sabrina] Yeah.

[Brad clears throat]

Oh, boy.
Is that jewelry?

it might be a ring.


68.

Silver usually
rings around 70.

I'm not saying
it's silver, but--

[indistinct talking]


any evidence of bodies

in the ground
or old structures.

So, that makes sense
that at one time

there were
graves back there

but the bodies
have been removed.

And that's
what the ERI survey said,

that there are
unmarked graves there

but the bodies
just aren't there anymore.

[night din]

â™ª

environmental sensors for us.


And I'm going to be monitoring
temperature, pressure.

And also, I--
I do have a magnetic coil

that I've wired up
to an amplifier,

and I just
put it on the walking stick.

I felt like there was...

Atmospheric data has always
been really important to me

on any investigation I do

because I have
found correlations

between a change
in the environment

with paranormal
activity happening.

I'm not saying that
that's a ghost.

But what I am saying
is that there are weird,

interesting things
that sometimes take place

when you see
a dip in the data.

And I always find
that to be fascinating.

-Nice.
-Ta-da.

We look great.

Oh, my gosh.

-[Elizabeth] I look crazed.
-[Dustin laughs]

All right,
so I brought a Theremin,

um, which is
an old school instrument.

So, if we could
wire the door.

But we're going to extend
the range of it, right?

so I think by, like,

extending the antenna out.

-[Dustin] Uh-huh.
-And since the--

We both
when we first arrived here,

we were drawn
to this door frame.

-[Dustin] Yeah.
-So I think that

by creating a threshold.

So, if any, like,
subtle energy comes in,

the hope is that
it sets off the Theremin.

That would be great.

So, we're just
wrapping the copper wire

around the, uh, pitch antenna
of the Theremin, here.

So, this would be
normally how you control

the, uh-- the pitch sound
by moving your hand closer.

Completely experimental.

Not sure
if it's going to work.

But if it does, that would be
really interesting.

to continue to try new things.



-[Elizabeth gasps]
-Yeah?

So now it's working
because normally

you have to be
touching that.

Go, go in the door.

-[Elizabeth] Oh.
-[Dustin] Yeah.

That time it worked.
Yeah. That time it worked.

-[Elizabeth] That worked.
-[Dustin] So it is--

It's building up
and getting the whole thing.

-Yeah.
-[Dustin] Yeah--

-Oh, see! Can you hear it?
-[Dustin] Yup.

-[gasps]
-That's a lot of fun.

Oh, that's so fun.

I love science.

[both laughing]

I like it.
That's great.

The science community
isn't open

to the idea
of the paranormal.

And unfortunately,
the paranormal community

isn't viewed as--

It's not taken seriously.
Like, that's a problem.

We're just
not taken seriously.

I've always thought
it was interesting

that for some reason
people think science

and spirituality
have to butt heads.

You know, the fact
that research scientists

would be afraid to speak
to somebody about something

of a spiritual nature
or paranormal nature,

I think shows that divide.

And that divide is--
is a problem.

I would love to get
to a place where the field's

taken more seriously,
because not only do I think

the paranormal community
is missing out

but I also feel
like the science community

is missing out.

Do the initial run in here.

Yeah, I think yesterday-- What?

I got too close to it.

-[Elizabeth] Okay.
-[Dustin laughs]

But this is interesting
because if something--

This doorway
seems to be an active spot

so if something decides
to walk through here,

we should be
able to hear it.

So we're going
to do an experiment.

Very good.

So first we're going
to do an initial session.

[rapid beeping]

Everything's beeping.
Did you touch the door?


â™ª

out for both these things.

[rapid rattling]

I'm just going
to baseline this meter.

Uh-huh.

Hello.
This is Elizabeth and Dustin.

If you're able
to communicate with us

or maybe
let us hear your voice.

Try to speak
into this device here.

We may be
able to hear you.

â™ª

Dustin to, uh,
the team out in the tech tent.

Can you see
if anybody is walking

in the DVR cameras downstairs?

-[Brad] Nobody's walking.
-[radio static]

Okay, so... timestamp.

[distant muffled thumping]

You hear that?

[night din]

Can you tell us
what road the house is on?

Is there a name
you like to go by?

What's the object
on the stairs that you move?

-[indistinct] out here.
-[Dustin] All right.


Pardon me, young lady.

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>Is there a name</i>

<i>you like to go by?</i>

[Dustin on recorder]<i> What's</i>
<i>the object on the stairs</i>

<i>that you move?</i>

[faint voice]

-Oh! Did you hear that?
-[Elizabeth] I did!


Wow.

[Dustin on recorder]<i> What's</i>
<i>the object on the stairs</i>

<i>that you move?</i>

[voice faintly]<i> Baseball.</i>

Oh! That's so good.

I think
he says "Baseball".

[Elizabeth over speaker]
<i>Yeah, right?</i>

Crazy that
baseball was said.


How much is that
collectively us

-knowing?
-[Dustin] Right.

Maybe after
we charge it up,

we ask those
questions again.

-The same exact ones.
-[Dustin] Yeah.

if there's a change.

And then maybe we should
throw in another question

that we don't know
the answer to.

I did bring an ion motor

that actually
creates and generates

its own
positive force field.

But it's a--
it's a pretty serious one.

Could be
potentially dangerous.


but I want to change
the environment.

I want to see
what it's like before.

And I want to see
if you induce anything else

in the environment,
if that also creates a change.

If activity increases.

I can smell it.

Can you tell me
what street this house is on?

Can you tell us the name
of the woman that lives here?

The woman
that built this house?

tell us what's going on

with the lights
inside this house?

on the stairs that you move?

Two gentlemen
that have investigated here

for 12, 13, 14 years.

Do you know
either of their names?

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>Can you tell me what street</i>

<i>this house is on?</i>

[faint crackling]

[Dustin over recorder]
<i>Could you tell us the name--</i>

I think
he says "White Road."

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>Can you tell me what street</i>

<i>this house is on?</i>

[faint crackling]

[distorted voice]

Yeah.
It says, "White Road."

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>...what street</i>

<i>this house is on?</i>

[faint cracking]

-[voice]<i> White Road.</i>
-[Dustin exhales]


<i>of the woman that lives here?</i>

<i>-The woman that built house?</i>
-What?

<i>the name of the</i>

<i>woman that lives here?</i>

<i>The woman</i>
<i>that built this house?</i>

[Elizabeth over recorder]<i> Can</i>
<i>you tell us what's going on--</i>

Yikes.

[Dustin over recorder]
<i>What is the object</i>

<i>on the stairs that you move?</i>

[faint voice]

He just said,
"Ball" that time, yeah.

He just said, "Ball."

[Dustin over recorder]
<i>Two gentlemen that have</i>

<i>investigated here</i>
<i>for 12, 13, 14 years.</i>

<i>Do you know</i>
<i>either of their names?</i>

[faint voice]

Did he say, "Jack?"

So now we're going to do

something a little different

and we're going to
show you some cards.

Here is the first card.

Can you tell us
what you see?

[eerie music]

We're going to show you
the second card.

Tell us what you see.

Is it a number
or is it a face card?

Here's the third card.

What color is it?

What number?

Putting down card three.

I'm going to show you
card four, now.

Can you tell me
what card Dustin is holding?

Putting down card four.

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>Here is the first card.</i>

<i>Can you tell us</i>
<i>what you see?</i>

[faint crackling]

<i>We're going to show you</i>
<i>the second card.</i>

<i>Tell us what you see.</i>

I think he says it's four.

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>What color is it?</i>

<i>-What number?</i>
-[faint voice]


-It literally said, "Six."
-It's crazy.

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>I'm going to show you</i>

<i>card four, now.</i>

<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>what card Dustin is holding?</i>

[faint voice]


to play this again because--

-[Dustin] This is ridiculous.
-[Elizabeth] Bizarre.

I've never had

a communication response like,

with this
blind study thing

that seemed
to go that well.

No, but let's
back off for a second

because
it wasn't just that.

Like at the end,

we re-asked
the same questions

-and we got clearer responses.
-Clearer answers.

Oh, crap.

White Road. Alice.

Said something
about their names.

I couldn't pick it up.
I thought it said, "Jack."


I heard, "Alice."

-[Alice] Oh, they did?
-I heard white--

They got "White Road,"
they got, "Alice."

White Road, damn.
That's where I live.

I mean, damn,
that's getting personal.

[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>Here's the third card.</i>

<i>What color is it?</i>

<i>-What number?</i>
-[faint voice]

That you hear very clearly.

-[Dustin] Six, six.
-[Alice] Did he say, "Six?"

Getting direct
responses to the card--


[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>Here's the third card.</i>

<i>-What color is it?</i>
-[faint voice]

-[Elizabeth]<i> What number?</i>
-[both] Red six.


[Elizabeth over recorder]
<i>I'm going to show you</i>

<i>card four now.</i>

-That's so wild.
-This is insane.

<i>Can you tell me what card</i>

<i>-Dustin is holding?</i>
-[faint voice]

Red ten.

But you don't really
get the impact of it

because it's like-- you know,
there's a conscious being,

invisible-- invisible,
conscious being in your room.

I mean, really,
that's a little unnerving.

I mean, really,
you just go take a shower.

You think, "Who is
watching me take a shower?"

I mean, really, you do,
because something's there.

Some-- something's there.

Last time we got baseball,

which was great by itself.

-[Elizabeth] Right.
-But now it was

every question pretty much
had an answer, every card--

Even if we couldn't
make it out.

Yeah.

-The cards are wild, though.
-Yeah.

it just blows my mind.

Of all the years doing this,
like I've never had--

I mean,
you're lucky if you get an EVP.

It's still pretty good.

So much more
could be found out,

explored,
experimented with.

You know, if we were
just open to the idea

of incorporating
science into the mix.

I think one of the nice things
about the Mississippi house

of Alice's house is
it allows for that to happen.

Because it's been
documented long enough

where it's not just
some crazy story.

I think that's the--
the nice thing about it.

[night din]


Hello.

My name's Laurie McDonald.

I'm a certified
clinical hypnotherapist

at True You Hypnotherapy
in Sacramento, California.

So, you tell me
where you want me.

in coming here

is to facilitate a process

that will allow Alice

to feel that sense of ease

and to be able to take
possession of her own home.

â™ª

We'll begin

the way I always begin

by just having you
take some long, deep

rhythmic breaths
in through the nose

and out through the mouth.

And in a moment,

I'm going
to count backwards.

Ten, seven.
Twice as deep now.

On five, on three...

two...

and one.

We're going to go
back to a time

when you awoke

and saw
a very specific light.

See that now.

It-- it--
it came on with a--

With a flash
in an instant.

I just,
totally unexpected.

Everything else
in the room was black.

Total black.
Very black.

What if it turns toward me?
What happens?

I mean, it-- it--

And what is its purpose?


That-- I just
happened to be there.

I don't think it--
its intent was to appear to me.

Do you sense
in this light...

-intelligence?
-[Alice] Uh-huh.

Not that
the light's conscious

but that the...

governing
of the light is.

So, the light's
coming from a source?

Yeah.

Just, uh--
just intelligence, like--

like intelligent, um...

beings, maybe a group.

Or something they're--
they're intently interested in.

Sense into the light

and try to sense

their intent.

â™ª

Whatever they were doing,

it seemed very important.

It's like they were
all gathered around.

observing something
beneath the earth.

Who's the outcome
important to?

-[Alice] To them.
-To them.

And is there
anything else

about this
particular light

that we need
to know about or you're...

pretty comfortable?

I'm-- I'm-- I'm--

Yeah, I think
the light was just a means,

that there was
no particular meaning.

I'm very,
very happy to hear that.

Because you are
removed from it

from this moment forward

and for the rest
of your life...

removed from it.

Through eliminating fear,

we're opening up
other avenues of energy,

like curiosity.

And that's much
healthier

and puts her in a place
of personal empowerment.

So, I want you to take
a really deep breath now.

-Just really exhale.
-[exhales sharply]

And I want you
to really feel

how good it is to know

that you don't have to be
afraid of that anymore.

And let it all go.

[emotional piano instrumental]

And how does that feel?

I-- I do feel, um,

separated more from it.

So, coming back
now on one,

two, taking a deep
breath on three.

Wiggling the toes on four.

-[Alice] Uh-huh.
-[Laurie] Eyes open five.

-Okay.
-[Laurie] Very good.

the ultimate goal here

is to get Alice
comfortable in the house,

to get her to stay here.

It would be awesome

if she could
live here full time.

But right now,

she's not
living here full time.

Obviously, she won't even
sleep here alone at night.

But I want to take it
in steps, if I can.

If we can get her
in the house for a night

and then
maybe that one night

will turn
into a few nights.

And maybe the few nights
will turn into a week.

That week
becomes a month

and now
she's in the house full time.

Tonight, anyway,

I wanted
to get your feeling...

uh, on-- on, uh--
on the house

and on
where we're sort of at.

Well,
we spoke to the team

and they're,
you know, on standby

in case
you're okay with this.

But we are wondering
if maybe tonight

might be
a night you might be

willing to sleep
in the house.

You know, I've actually
been thinking about that

since the hypnosis

because for some reason,

you know,
it wasn't what I expected.

I expected that I would
have to relive that experience

but it wasn't that at all.

You know,
it was actually

getting out
of that experience.

And so I feel like
I can watch it

from a distance.

-[Steve] That's interesting.
-Yeah.

You know,
I'll sleep with my flashlight

and, um, I'm good.

-I'll-- I'll try to do it.
-[Steve] You're thinking--

-Uh-huh.
-[Steve] Really?

I think that
she knows that this is

the first step for her

to be able
to live in the house

and be able
to be here full time.

I don't necessarily
think that, you know,

the activity
is going to fully stop.

And if we weren't
able to ever get her

back inside the house,

I wouldn't
consider that a failure.

She has
so much more confidence

and I think that
that's a major stepping stone.

[piano instrumental]

I'm on speed dial.

Thank you.

â™ª

[crickets chirping]


I'll see you all
hopefully in the morning.


â™ª

[indistinct chatter]

â™ª

â™ª

Oh, yeah.

[indistinct chatter]

â™ª

[birds chirp]

â™ª

she slept in the house.

She slept in the house.

In a decade,
she hadn't done that.

The thing I remember
is the next morning,

walking in the door
and just smelling coffee.

She was waking up,
making coffee in her house.

That just hit me
in a different way.

It was neat.

I think it's a natural
response sometimes

to be afraid
of what you can't explain.

You have a right to have
your feelings validated.

But you also,
if you truly want to

understand that fear,

you have to explore it.

You have to
walk through that fear.

You have to
confront your fear.

Because something to remember

and I think
that's very important,

is sometimes
we don't acknowledge

our own personal power.

It's not easy

to change
the way we see things.

It's not easy
to change our perspective.

It takes practice,
it takes time, it takes work.

And this is our duty,
our responsibilities

and obligation
of being human.

This is what we do best.

We learn.

â™ª

Shakespeare said,

"To thine own self be true."

And then
that can't speak thoughts

to any man--
To your own self be true.

And it would have been
against my own truth

to have moved out
or to sell it.

and I set out to do

was to get Alice
back into her house.

And that happened.
She spent a night here.

And she woke up happy.

And Alice has turned
this whole thing...

to work for her.

And I just think
that is remarkable.

I think
her attitude is perfect.

And the fact
that she's already

making steps
to staying back in her home.

She's taking that fear away

and she's
replacing it with courage

and dedication
to getting answers.

She says she wants to further
the field and I think she has.

And I don't think
that's ever been done before.

So I'm kind of feeling like

this is the most thorough,

in-depth,
paranormal investigation

that has
ever been documented.

â™ª

[night din]

[dramatic music]

And I say 'when," not "if,"

because that carriage
will come down.

You can mark my words.

I've been saying it before

you guys even got here

and you're
going to hear it now.

I have no reason
to have the full confidence

but I do have
the full confidence.

The carriage
is coming down the stairs.

Any intelligent spirits
that are in the house.

Focus your energy
on that carriage

that I placed at the top
of the stairs and you have

our full permission
to push it down the stairs.

So, please
focus your energy.

I know you can
without a doubt,

and push that carriage
down the stairs.


-Good?
-[Kendall] Great job.

-All right.
-[Kendall] Wonderful job.

Carriage is coming down.

just hold on,

uh, [indistinct].

[muffled, indistinct talking]

All right,
I'm going to arm it so...

30 on here.


-All right.
-[robotic voice] [indistinct]

away. Exit now.
