Welcome back to this space that
we have that we share together.

â™ª All these
people all around me â™ª

â™ª always worried about
something yeah, â™ª

â™ª saying I should
stay up in the books â™ª

â™ª and not start
to build a buzz-- â™ª

This is like a day in the life
realistic, 100% accurate day

in my life.

â™ª Quit fucking with the
plans, a couple young kids, â™ª

â™ª polo kicks, not rich â™ª

â™ª stacking money
on a one way trip. â™ª

And you can see my hair is wet.

And I brought myself my coffee.

Saying I should
stay up in the books

and not start to
build a buzz but they

the ones bugging, yeah.

So I don't really
feel like staying.

I don't really
feel like playing.

Quit fucking with the plans,
a couple of young kids.

I'm very hot.

Stacking money on a
one way trip, yeah.

Whoa.

OK.

We're almost at
2,000 which is crazy.

And once we hit
it, Madison and I

are going to get blackout
drunk again on camera

like we did for 1,000 but
no vodka shots this time.

We're going to stick to the
rosÃ© all day, every day.

So yeah, that is it.

Hi, guys.

Welcome back.

So today, we are going
to be going on our river.

Well, yeah, it's not
our river, but we're

going to go on to our
annual river trip.

And I am super,
super, super excited.

But I also, I don't
know, feeling a little--

Yeah, I don't know.

I guess it's going to be
different and a little weird

this year without--

OK, well, I'll show you.

So this is 100% going to
be the strangest unboxing

video that I've ever done.

And yeah, so Chuy actually made
it just in time for the trip.

And we have his urn--

Yeah, there's a little
note from his mom here, so.

Yo, you ready?

You scare the shit out of me.

What is this?

Chuy.

What's up, bro?

Hey, was that recording?

Are you still doing
this vlog shit?

Come on.

You only ever get one view.

Come on, we got stuff to do.

Let's go.

Let's get going.

Love you.

You guys all know that we
got like at least 100 views

on the last video.

So yeah, little,
little Jackson doesn't

know because he actually
barely watches these.

But we love him, right?

Yeah, we do.

He's lucky he's cute.

Oh, here stand like that.

Hop to the river.

Hop to the river.

Girl, I
love your extensions.

Thanks.

I love your sweet
little face, Maddie.

We should totally do a tutorial
on why you put those in.

I bet that would crush.

Come on, guys.

Let's go.

Nice to see you too, Dee.

This is going to be.

All right, ladies, next
stop, Monte Rio, T-minus,

hella hours.

I hope everybody
went to the bathroom,

too, because I'm not
changing that black water.

OK, whatever, dad.

â™ª It's safe to
swim in the Mediterranean. â™ª

â™ª The sea creatures made a
pact with the governments â™ª

â™ª they won't come back. â™ª

â™ª Because there are
no sharks even after dawn. â™ª

â™ª Fins to the left,
to the right. â™ª

â™ª Just take a big bra and
meet me in the tops. â™ª

â™ª I'll be the only
beast to take a bite. â™ª

â™ª So put your suit on and
don't be a baby, lady. â™ª

â™ª There are no reasons so
don't be a baby, lady. â™ª

â™ª Put on your bathing suit. â™ª

â™ª Don't be a baby, lady. â™ª

â™ª Lady. â™ª

I don't know.

I just think it won't be the
same this year without Chuy.

I mean, he died on the river.

Should we really be
going back there?

Dee, chip, Chuy, OD'd.

He didn't die
because of the river.

And plus, he would have
wanted us to do this, anyway.

100%.

I mean, he loved this
trip more than anyone.

Remember, when he
brought that slingshot

and he was launching beers at
people as this..

Man, classic Chuy.

Totally.

So why wouldn't he want
us to keep it going.

I'm just saying
he should be here.

Well, here he is.

Chuy, going to miss
you there, bro.

There's two extra cases.

Natty ice are going
to miss him, too.

Those few extra bumps, too.

Hey, guys, chill.

We all party a
little bit too hard.

It's not Chuy's fault
he had a problem.

It's a disease.

Mental illness, self medication.

OK, Dr. Phil, how many credits
did JC have again, like five?

More than you, Mr.
Welcome to speedy change.

Here we go back in
I'm the one person

in this car who has a job.

All right, guys, let's see if
you're talking to that trash

when I go by the
alcohol, all right?

By the way, are we buying
stuff for Blake and Zola?

Hell no.

Blake is on his own.

Why the fuck is Zola
bring him anyway?

They're supposed
to be broken up.

Baby-mama drama.

Yeah, mommy and daddy can be YO.

Still can't believe
they have a kid.

Wonder who's going to watch
it while they're gone.

Not in it, Dee.

You make Thea sound like
they're a dog or something.

Just ew.

They totally have a kid.

Yeah, I don't know, it
makes me feel like old.

Blake is old.

He's like 26.

Blake's hot, though.

Totes.

Too bad he's a douche.

Hey.

Blake's my boy.

I like him.

No, it's true, Jackson.

Blake's kind of a douche.

He's certainly not you.

Ew, get a room.

All right, guys.

We made it.

Oh.

Don't even.

OK.

Hurry up, let's go.

We are.

Auntie Kali.

Hey, guys.

Zola.

Hey.

Hey.

You brought Thea.

Yeah, my mom's on some
self-determination bullshit,

says if I want to
have some fun, then

I'm going to have to take on my
own responsibility or whatever.

Hey, Dee.

Hey.

Yo, ladies, y'all going to
help me with the shit or what?

Allow me, miss.

Thank you dear, sir.

Yeah, real fucking
chivalrous assholes.

Kali, is it 2,000 yet?

Not yet but when I do, we're
going to get fucked up.

Mad, I'm filming.

Is that OK?

Yeah, you should see my Tinder.

This is nothing.

No, it's all good.

I'll turn it off.

Speaking of 2,000, you
subscribed, right Dee?

I-- I haven't gotten to it yet.

What?

Dee, are you serious?

I'm busy studying for my LSATs.

School has been super busy.

Yeah, it's all good.

I know you have your
own shit going on.

No, Dee that's fucked up.

Kali's really trying to make
something of herself here.

She's putting herself out there,
and she's actually really good.

I'm not saying that you need
to help her with her vids

like I do.

But you could at the
least be supportive.

I am supportive.

Does that mean I have
to watch her videos?

I mean, I feel like that's a
pretty good way to support her.

No, I can be supportive
by not doing that--

Like how?

By just being her friend.

In what way or--

Mad, it's OK,

We're best friends, Dee.

Why would I need
you to subscribe?

It's all good, Kali.

You are just one viral bit
away from being a star.

I just know it.

Thanks, babe.

Why do you even care, Madison?

It's not going to be
you who's Insta famous.

I'm not allowed to
want to help my friend?

Yeah, sure.

You can do that.

I just don't see
what's in it for you.

You're fucked for that, Dee.

I just want to see Kali succeed.

Not everyone is just
out for themselves.

And what's that
supposed to mean?

Nothing.

I'm just saying.

Oh, really?

I feel like you have more
to say to add to that.

Hey.

OK.

Let's all just relax and
get back to the real world.

OK?

You're so annoying.

Let's get drunk.

Never.

Just drink.

â™ª Vision at the
function getting blurred, â™ª

â™ª need to slow down. â™ª

â™ª Grass and a buzz shit
sounding like it's Motown. â™ª

â™ª Go out. â™ª

â™ª Go numb. â™ª

â™ª Head ghost now. â™ª

â™ª City old got visions of
the coast now breaking. â™ª

â™ª I'm too faded. â™ª

â™ª Maybe if I cut it off,
I could still save this. â™ª

Cheers.

â™ª Talking to the pavement with
a girlie on my left side. â™ª

â™ª And she's saying she just want
to smoke something She just â™ª

â™ª want to smoke something. â™ª

â™ª I want to talk to him. â™ª

â™ª She just want to-- â™ª

Cold water.

â™ª Smoke something. â™ª

â™ª She just want to
smoke something. â™ª

â™ª She just want to
smoke something. â™ª

â™ª Ole, ole, ole, ole. â™ª

â™ª Ole, ole, ole, ole ole. â™ª

Let's go!

All right.

Cheers, motherfucker.

What are you doing?

Oh, my god.

Let's go, come on.

You suck.

Oh, my God.

Come on.

You suck at this game, Blake.

I swear to god.

Zola.

Who the hell knocks like that?

What's up, bro?

We're being too loud?

I just came to tell you
to watch out if you're

planning on floating the river.

Yeah, we're floating.

I wouldn't if I were you.

We do it every year.

This year is different.

The river has been taking
people, certain people.

Like who?

Like your friend.

Chuy?

I don't know his name.

He seemed like a nice kid.

Come back next year.

How about you come back
when you get your fucking

shirt clean, buddy?

I'm warning you.

Do not float the river.

Whatever, old man.

Just get the fuck out of here.

You fucking believe this guy?

Hello?

Hello?

Whatever, we'll
just shut the door.

All right.

All right.

Don't y'all float
this river, you hear?

Let's get drunk.

I can't.

Like what the fuck?

You'd have something.

You'd have something.

All right.

Now--

You got to go for it.

Yes, now I'll drink.

All of it, all of it,
all of it, all of it.

I'm going to splash you
if you don't chug it.

I drink it, OK?

Here.

I'll take the rest.

Ow.

I thought something bit me.

You suck.

Oh, man.

That dude was wilding.

He's a fucking bitch.

Well, look, what if--
what if he's right?

Like what if the
river took Chuy?

What does that even mean, Dee?

Chuy OD'd and fell
into the river.

The river was just there.

It didn't take shit.

I guess.

I don't know.

Why would he just say that?

Because he's a fucking
tweak or some shit.

I don't know.

Look, OK, the river
has no current.

It's like two feet deep.

The only thing
dangerous on this river

is that, to be honest with you.

Yeah, probably.

Fuck, now, I'm scared of him.

You know, I'll protect you.

Put on some music.

â™ª Don't get
too close 'cause â™ª

â™ª there's a lot you
don't know. â™ª

â™ª Don't get too close 'cause
there's a lot you don't know. â™ª

â™ª Don't get too close 'cause
there's a lot you don't know. â™ª

â™ª I'm antisocial these days. â™ª

â™ª I don't like talking. â™ª

â™ª You better keep
walking 'cause there â™ª

â™ª ain't a lot we can say I
promise my secrets is safe. â™ª

â™ª Ain't nobody
taking my place. â™ª

â™ª You tell pretty lies. â™ª

â™ª And I see through your
smile you got envy wrote all â™ª

â™ª on your face, yeah. â™ª

â™ª 'Cause ever since
me and my brothers â™ª

â™ª got paid people keep calling,
trying to eat from my plate. â™ª

â™ª And bitches keep coming
back, trying to save face. â™ª

â™ª I got to stay hip. â™ª

â™ª I don't got time to waste. â™ª

â™ª I got some things that
been keeping me awake. â™ª

â™ª So I ain't been asleep-- â™ª

Hey.

Hey.

So are you back with Zola?

Physically here, yes but
not like psychologically.

I mean I'm just
with her for Thea.

We're not like together,
like together, together.

Together?

Together out there?

Together out there?

'cause there's a
lot you don't know.

Only keep family
beside me 'cause all

of you folk never liked me.

Blake.

Yeah?

You have a kid.

I'm so not into that, OK?

I'm sorry.

I'm going to law school.

I got to handle my
business as do you, sir.

Oh, come on, Dee.

You know we were always
meant to be together.

Just one more kiss, come on.

No.

Come on.

Just one more kiss.

Besides-- just
doesn't feel right.

I mean, Chuy died in there.

Where are you going?

Don't get too close 'cause
there's a lot you don't know.

Zola, I--

Dee, shut the fuck up.

I saw you guys out there.

Nothing happens.

Literally it's exactly what
I predicted what happened.

I don't have time for this.

Well, congrats.

You're getting exactly
what you want ever since--

Nothing happened.

High school.

You need to-- please,
Zola, I don't--

Don't touched me.

Even though--

I've done--

Fuck you too, Blake.

Fuck you.

I saw you all out there.

What?

Nothing happened.

Just chill the fuck out.

Fuck.

Great.

Look what you did.

Now, she's awake.

Shut the fuck up.

I'm not dealing with that.

You go deal with that.

Why the fuck would
I deal with that?

Mom?

Fuck.

See, she's even calling for you.

Shut the fuck up.

Just go get her blanket.

She's fucking calling for you.

Why are they still together?

Oh, my god, shots?

Yes, please.

Kali?

I think Jacks and I are going
to retire for the evening.

Ooh.

If you catch my drift.

What was-- ew.

So nasty.

I'm not talking about boning.

OK, OK, we get it.

Thanks.

No, it's fine.

Me and Dee are just
going to be having

a threesome with Jose Cuervo.

Or maybe that old
creepy groundskeeper guy

is still out there.

You could call him.

No,

That dude was way too sober.

I might be a little
bit too drunk.

Cheers for you.

Look at my boyfriend, everyone.

Isn't he cute?

Yo, Kali, turn that shit off.

So you guys, things got a
little bit messy last night

to say the least.

But that's OK.

Today is going to be wild.

I mean, I don't know
if it's actually

going to be wild because it
hasn't happened yet but yeah.

I think it's going to be crazy.

So keep on watching or don't.

I don't really care,
except I do actually care.

So please like and subscribe and
let me finish my make up here.

Guys, we should get going.

It's almost noon.

So?

So it'll be dark by
the time we get done.

Oh, shit, bro.

We got to drop the RV
at the parking lot.

All right, let's go.

I'll come with.

Is she really going to come?

She's not a dog, Dee.

I can't just leave her in
the bathroom for five hours.

Oh, shit, dude.

I thought I told you
not to float the river.

Yeah.

And I thought we told
you to fuck off, bro.

Blake, get back in the car.

Yo, what's up, old man?

We're going to have
a fucking problem?

You're going to have a problem
if you float the river just

like your friend Chuy.

Hey, get our friend's name out
of your fucking mouth, bro.

You know shit about him.

You think you know how he died?

Jackson, this is fucked.

Get back in the car.

You think he overdosed?

Man, shut the fuck up, you
potbellied sister fucking hick.

Go back to your trailer and
eat some fucking pork rinds

before I whoop your fucking
ass, you understand me?

I'll fucking knock
you off the concrete.

It's not my problem then.

Yeah.

Well, leave us the fuck alone or
we'll be your fucking problem.

Fuck out of here.

What the fuck, Blake?

Hey, babe.

Chill, chill.

We got this.

Let's go get some fucking tacos.

What's up, brother?

What can I get for you?

I'll have three
carne asada, please.

Actually, we're all vegan.

OK.

We'll just get some chicken.

Yeah, three chicken.

Yeah, please.

So you guys, this creepy
groundskeeper dude

is actually trying
to kill us like irl.

Yo, that dude is a fick.

Straight up, bro.

That dude's a fucking
100% dumbass, right?

I don't know.

Maybe the creepy dude is right.

Like maybe it's a
sign or an omen.

What do you mean an omen?

Like maybe this isn't the
year to float the river

with Chuy and all.

I mean he obviously
knows the family.

Plus, I feel like I'm
at barf from last night.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, not in the hellcat.

Are you fucking kidding me?

You can barf from
the fucking river.

Yo, are you filming this, too?

I don't know why.

I mean you do the same
shit as Bell Benton.

And she's got like
400k followers,

plus her titties are bigger.

Bro, no, yo, stop.

Yo, I'm just kidding, man.

Chill.

No.

Thea.

No.

Thea, stop.

All right.

fine.

Thea, it's fine.

It's fine, OK?

Come here.

Come here.

It's fine.

Yo, what the fuck, Zola?

I leave for five minutes
and she falls apart.

Can't you control your daughter?

You were gone for
30 minutes, asshole.

And she didn't get that
much sleep last night.

That's why she's breaking down.

All right, you know what,
you guys just go ahead.

We're going to go up
and watch a movie, OK?

No, no.

Thea's got to man up.

What?

Come here.

Here, put this life
jacket on, here.

She doesn't want to go.

Come on.

Come on.

Yo, where's Chuy?

Oh, shit.

I'll get him.

Keeping you safe here.

Cheers to the boy.

Say hi!

â™ª June blues, yeah. â™ª

â™ª I got the June blues,
yeah. â™ª

â™ª Walk 'round like who you,
yeah. â™ª

â™ª Just something you

â™ª Go blame the June blues,
yeah. â™ª

â™ª It's just the June blues,
yeah. â™ª

â™ª Walk 'round like
who you, yeah. â™ª

â™ª Just something
you get used to. â™ª

â™ª Breaking news got me
breakin', breakin', breakin'. â™ª

â™ª I was present hopeless â™ª

â™ª Prayin' prayin'

â™ª You ain't peaked, death was

â™ª Trust that he be good

â™ª don't make no mistakes. â™ª

Guys, something's in there.

Something is grabbing
my fucking leg.

Fuck you.

You're such a fucking dick.

Jackson, I can't
believe I missed that.

That stuff's killing unreal.

You got to be quicker
than that, babe.

You know, they caught an 8-foot
sturgeon around here last year.

Gross.

Is it going to eat us?

No, bud.

We're going to eat it.

No one told me that there's
creatures in this water.

Oh, don't worry, they're
more afraid of you

than you are of them.

Am I supposed to be offended?

Yeah, low key.

I wonder if there are
monsters in this river, too.

No, sweetie.

There's no such
thing as monsters.

You're right.

I'm always right.

Yeah, this is nice.

I do miss Chuy, though.

Yeah, I do, too.

I just wish there was more that
we could have done for him.

You were a good friend to him.

He was lucky to have someone
like you in his life.

Ew, ew, ew, ew.

There's something on my leg.

Ew, get it off,

Zola, here.

Get it off.

I'll get these off.

Ew.

I thought this was supposed
to be more scared of me.

I guess you might
have sweet blood.

Yo, where's Thea?

What?

What do you mean what?

I gave her to you.

I swear she was just right here.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Thea?

Thea!

Thea!

Thea!

Thea!

I swear to God, when we find
her, I'm taking her from you.

You can't fucking control her.

It's not good for her,
and it's not safe.

What do you think I've
been doing by myself

for the past five years?

Well, it's a miracle
she's gotten this far.

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god, Blake.

I see her.

I see her.

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

Man, Dee, she's so jelly of
you, she forgot her own kid.

Seriously, I don't know
why they're still together.

I can't believe Dee had leeches.

Ew.

I totally had leeches.

Sounds like an STI.

Ew.

Oh, baby.

Wait.

Do you have a condom?

I have leeches.

That's hot.

Ew.

Blake?

Hello?

Thea?

Thea?

Blake?

Blake?

Zola.

Blake?

It was supposed to
be a friend weekend.

I can't believe
they brought her.

Madison.

Yeah, I hope they find Thea.

Should've just duck gone
down the river or something.

I don't know.

Blake, Blake, Blake.

Zola, stop.

Relax, relax, relax.

I saw-- I saw--

Zola, Zola, relax.

Where's Thea?

Oh, my god.

What?

You don't have her?

What the fuck, Zola?

What are you doing here?

They killed Blake.

What do you mean
they killed Blake?

I saw it with my own eyes.

There's something
in those woods.

That's OK.

I'll go find her.

That thirsty?

Madison, someone just died.

Bullshit.

You really believe this bitch?

Look at her.

She's fucking hammered.

Are you sure?

Yeah, no problem.

I'll go with her.

It's fine.

Jackson, I'm scared.

Can you stay here with us?

Maybe Maddie can go.

Fuck that.

It's OK, guys.

I'll go see if I can find Thea.

Hey, we're not that
far from the cabin.

If I find her,
we'll just go there.

What if Blake actually
did get killed?

No, I'm with Maddie.

There's no way Blake is dead.

I love you.

Shut up, Kali.

See you in like five minutes.

Hi, guys.

So things have kind
of gone downhill

since last time we chatted.

We lost Thea.

And Zola is convinced that
something happened to Blake.

I don't know.

Do you think that something
actually happened to Blake?

Maybe it was that creepy
groundskeeper dude

from this morning.

But yeah, I don't know.

She's like catatonic.

And I'm going to
be live streaming

all day so be sure
to like, share--

Jackson, read the room,
the girl's in shock.

Jackson's right here.

Zola?

Zola?

Zola!

Zola!

Zola, what the fuck?

Zola.

We have to do something.

I know but what's in there?

Do you think it's a sturgeon?

No, where did she go?

Zola!

Zola!

Oh, my god, Zola.

Shit.

What the fuck?

Jackson!

Jackson!

Jackson!

You see her?

Fuck, I can't find her.

Fuck! where the fuck did she go?

Jackson!

Oh, my god.

Oh, fuck it's hot.

Get out.

Oh, my god.

Fuck.

Guys, get the fuck to shore.

Thea?

Oh, my god.

What the fuck?

Guys, I can't get a signal.

What are we going to do?

Oh, my god, Zola.

It's Chuy's soul.

He's come back to haunt us.

You spaz, ghosts aren't real.

Yeah, some people thought
that coronavirus wasn't real,

and it still killed them.

Even if Chuy was a ghost,
he was our best friend.

Why would he come back
and do this to us?

I don't know.

Maybe he's mad at us that we
weren't there for him, that we

didn't try to help him more.

I mean, whatever it is.

We got to do it now.

Do what?

You know--

No, not like this.

Maybe it's the only
way to put him to rest.

I'll do it.

Chuy--

Chuy, I'm sorry that
you were depressed.

And I'm sorry that you felt
the need to self medicate.

And that's all that
defined your death.

But it's not what
defined your life.

You're the life of the party.

And you are the brightest
face in every room.

And you never said a single
bad thing about anyone

even when Maddie and
I would have our epic

shit talking sessions.

You held us together, Chuy.

And now, you're gone.

Then we are falling apart.

And I know that
wherever you are,

you would be trying to help us.

And you wouldn't
try and hurt us,

because you were a good
person even though we weren't

there for you when
we should have been,

and that fucking sucks.

We're so sorry.

We love you, Chuy.

Are you sure?

Yeah, I would not get
back on that inner tube

if it was Justin Bieber's
big beautiful dick.

Gross, Mad.

OK, take care of yourself.

I love you.

I love you, Kali Fyre.

All right.

I have the girl.

No, no, no.

Stop.

She's safe.

I can take you to her,
but you have to be quiet.

You're in danger if you don't.

You haven't vlog since--

Yeah.

I hadn't even thought about it.

It's been nice.

It's just you and me, no
phone, no viewers to act for.

I'm not acting when I vlog.

I'm just being me.

Yeah, but it's like
a version of you.

What do you mean?

It's like I've known
you for 10 years

and then there's the real you.

And then there's
the Kali Fyre you.

And those two aren't
the same people.

You don't think I
know that, Jackson?

You don't think that
I feel like a fraud

every time I hit
that record button,

or do you think I'm so
frigging awkward about it?

So why do you even do it?

I don't know.

Maybe it's something
that I just have to do,

makes me feel important,
gives me a voice.

Yeah, but you should talk
about other important stuff

like going premed and all that.

Like what happened to that?

People change.

I'm not really sure
I like this change.

Are you trying to tell me
that you don't like my vlog?

Is that it?

I thought you knew that
I didn't like your vlog.

I always tell you
that I don't like it.

I thought you were kidding.

But why would I be kidding?

It's been three years
since we graduated.

And everybody else
is making moves.

And you were just
going to be 40,

like making makeup
tutorials or something?

Geez.

I'm sorry.

No, no, no, you want to
talk about it, clearly.

So let's talk about it.

Do you need me to
say it out loud?

No, that's fine.

That way you can
hear how ridiculous

it sounds, because I'll do it.

Yeah?

OK, sweet.

Let's go.

I want to be Instagram
famous when I grow up.

I want to get that
blue checkmark.

And I want to ride this
wave until it's over.

And I want to get paid to
try makeup that cosmetics

company sent to me.

And I want to get
paid to rosÃ© all day.

And I want to vlog from tropical
beaches, not some fucking--

Some fucking what?

No.

Say it.

Never mind.

Say it.

Come on, you don't want to be
like at a white trash river

float with all your friends
like you are right now.

No.

That's not what I meant.

But you didn't have to.

It's like Kali Fyre's too good
for her and all of her friends.

I guess--

It's not what it's about.

She's not really worth
with her friends.

Jackson.

What?

Like no, it's honestly--

Jackson.

The truth, though.

Jackson Jackson!

Are you OK?

Yeah, I think so.

We're almost there.

In there?

What is it?

It's a safe place.

Can't she just come out here?

It's pretty cold in there.

Take this.

Thea?

Mom?

No, it's Dee.

Your mom's friend.

Thea.

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

Yeah, let's float.

Yeah, let's float.

Yeah, that's real, real smart.

Let's just go float
on the death river.

Fuck that.

I'm gonna be dry.

Gonna get service.

Somebody's going to pick me up.

No, no, no.

Where are my parents?

Is something wrong?

Thea, sometimes being an
adult is just really hard.

You know, your mommy and
daddy love you very much.

Yes, they argue sometimes
but not about you.

And then what's it about?

How about grown
up stuff, sweetie?

Is that why my dad left?

Your daddy will never
really leave you.

Have you ever done
a pinky swear?

No.

Well, maybe but I don't
think I remember it.

Do you know why we do it?

No.

Well, to promise something.

Oh.

And you know why we
use our pinky fingers?

Well?

Well, you know how we've
been floating on this river?

I didn't want to go
but my dad made me.

I know, sweetie.

But do you remember how we
put the tubes on the river

and it flowed down?

Yeah.

Well, our arteries are
like little tiny rivers

carrying blood from your heart
to everywhere it needs to go.

It's going to your feet, going
to your knees, your eyes.

It went to my butt?

Yes, even to your butt.

You know something.

But little kids,
those rivers don't

end at the tips of
their pinky fingers.

The little kids are special.

They have an
invisible river that

flows out from their pinky
fingers to their moms

and their dad's pinky fingers
no matter where they are.

In these invisible rivers,
they flow to your parents veins

and into your parents
hearts so that

no matter what, you'll always
be in their hearts forever.

Even when they die?

Yeah, it's forever,
the pinky swear.

Let's just get the
fuck out of here.

Shit.

What?

Oh, shit.

What?

My keys, they were
never in here.

OK, well, where are they then?

Oh, fuck.

What, Jackson?

Shit.

What?

I left them in the
center console, the raft.

The center console-- it's
not a fucking car, Jackson.

I know.

I'm so fucking dumb.

OK, we have to go back.

They must have dumped
out in the Rapids.

Yeah, well, I'll go upstream
and try to find them.

That'll be useless.

It's almost dark.

What other choice do we have?

What about Dee?

What if she found Thea?

It's getting dark.

I'll only go as
far as the rapids.

At least let me come with you.

It's scary up there.

You're safer here.

You should stay.

OK, please be careful.

I will.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Well, here I am in some
random fucking parking lot.

I started the day
out with my boyfriend

and three of my best friends.

I don't know if you'll see
it but Zola disappeared.

And we think she--

I'm not even going to say it.

Madison could have been picked
up by some psycho by now.

And who the fuck
knows where Dee went?

And Thea, I don't know
if I can know about Thea.

All just like--

It's all just too much.

And now, my mascara's smearing.

That was supposed to
be waterproof, so.

Hello?

Jackson?

Jackson, is that you?

Jackson?

Help me.

Madison!

Madison!

Madison!

Madison, what happened?

I fell on a stone.

I saw the guy.

What guy?

Who-- what?

How'd you even pass the rapids?

What rapids?

Never mind.

Never mind.

We got to-- we got
to get you some help.

Chuy?

Chuy, what are
you talking about?

I thought you OD'd and
fell into the river.

I hadn't taken that much before.

I know you're trying
to reach out to me.

I was trying to give you
tough love or some shit.

I should have been
there for you.

I was too busy focusing
on my stupid vlog shit.

No, it's not your
fault. It's the river.

It took me.

And now, it's trying
to take all of you.

It preys on your weaknesses.

Why do you even care, Madison?

You still doing this vlog shit?

Not everyone is just out--

I saw you guys out.

I don't have time for--

Move your fucking ass.

It preyed on mine.

Don't go near the river.

What the actual fuck?

Here, you good?

Yeah, I'm OK.

Hey, Jackson.

Yeah?

Remember I told you
I'd kill you earlier.

Yeah, I do.

I'm not going to kill you.

You're actually a good guy.

I'm glad you're
dating my best friend.

I'm glad you're my
girlfriend's best friend.

It's safe--

Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.

Jackson!

Jackson!

Hold on.

Jackson!

Jackson!

Hold on.

Jackson!

Madison!

Madison!

Jackson!

I have your friend and the girl.

They're safe.

What about the rest of them?

There is another girl.

Maddie?

She's about my age walking
down this road.

They're of the river.

They're off the river?

Of the river.

Hell does that mean?

It means I can't help them.

But I can help you.

Let me take you there.

I have to find my friends--

And Mace.

OK.

You don't happen to have
an iPhone charger, do you?

Can you at least tell
me where we're going?

To see your friend and the girl.

Yeah, you told me that.

But where?

I'm going to jump out
of this fucking car

if you don't tell me
where we're going.

I warned you not
to float the river.

So what, you're trying to punish
us for not listening to you?

It's not me.

OK, well then who?

Not who, what.

What are you talking about?

There is something
in that river.

It took your friend Chuy.

I don't know how many others.

I tried to save as many of
your friends as I could.

Do you think you're
immune from reality?

You're not.

We're here.

It's in here.

Hey, thank you.

I know that we can
be selfish sometimes.

And--

We made it really,
really hard for you.

I appreciate you still
trying to help us.

Hello?

Hello?

Wait.

Auntie Kali.

Dee.

What the heck, Dee?

He was trying to help us.

What?

Do you mean by killing Blake
and walking us in a shack?

My god, Dee.

I'm so sorry.

It got Zola, too.

There's something out there.

Yeah, there was.

Now, it's dead.

I don't think it was him, Dee.

OK.

All right, let's
go, motherfucker.

Dee, come back here.

Come on.

Dee.

Come on.

Come back here.

Hello?

Dee, please be quiet.

Come and get me.

I'm right fucking here.

Dee.

Come and get me.

Come back here--

Hello?

Now.

Dee?

Thea, I need to see
how fast you can run.

OK?

How about we do this
and see who wins?

OK.

Let's do a race.

Ready, set, go.

My mom has one of these.

<i>But yeah, I don't know</i>
<i>she's like catatonic.</i>

Zola.

Zola, Zola.

Don't go near the river.

â™ª My head so messed
up but I can't fold-- â™ª

What the actual fuck?

â™ª Got sights set right
up on these bands â™ª
