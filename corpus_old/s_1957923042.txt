[tender music]

<i>On a very special night every year,</i>

<i>legend has it that a jolly old man
in a red suit flies through the air</i>

<i>and brings gifts, laughter,
and joy to children everywhere.</i>

[narrators speaking multiple languages]

<i>There are those who believe in him
and those who don't.</i>


Of course. So I say, God blessÂ America.

Of course,
but God bless our different views?

Yeah. Oh, I think ours, freedom.

God bless freedom in all of its forms.

Okay.

Yes.

"Forms." All right...


Okay, thank you.
Yeah!


I finally set up an interview
with Mallards for my article

about their fall fashion line.

And I just sent Grant
my Fourth of July article.

Ah! Well, yours is better.

This was the easiest article
I've ever had to write.

It practically wrote itself.

I love this holiday.

Lisa!
[Lisa] Yes, Grant?

Did you just email me your article?
Yes, Grant.

Did you mention hot dogs?

I did.

I cannot wait for wiener ads
next to my article.

Yeah, well, we got to keep the lights on.

Oh, uh, did you mention the ski pants?

It is an article about the Fourth of July.

We'll talk.

You just said "wiener" to Grant.

[woman laughs]

[cell phone chimes]
You're my hero.

Oh, okay. You know what?
I gotta go pick up

Ella's bumblebee costume
for this Saturday.

I thought that Robert was on fair duty.

I volunteered to get the costume.
We are still on for this weekend.

"Independence Day."

"Best holiday on the calendar."


<i>"The Fourth of July never lets you down."</i>

<i>"It's just simple, summer fun with games,</i>

<i>"parades, concerts, burgers..."</i>

of fiery embers in the sky.</i>

<i>There's no cooking a turkey for six hours.</i>

<i>No cross-country travel
through snow and ice,</i>

<i>no feeling pressure to spend money,</i>

<i>which makes it way better than Christmas.</i>

"Way better than Christmas"?

Pfft. That's lame.

Who wrote this?
[cell phone rings]

Hey, Assan, I'm glad you're up.
I'm gonna get you in, like, 30 minutes.

We have to set up the booth.

All right, thanks, buddy. Bye.


["The Washington Post" playing]

[children shouting distantly]

Mom, we have to hurry.
Wait, wait, wait.

Get the rest of your costume, please.
Oh!

So, tell me more about Robert.

Oh, Robert had a little conflict today.

He's at the lake with his new girlfriend.

See? Just a little conflict.

Mom, my antenna.

Oh.

Hmm.

Oh, you know what? Here. Mm-hmm.

That'll keep.
Okay, come on.

Come on.
[Lisa] Ella!

Ella! We're going to get there.
It's going to be okay.

Okay. Thank you.

I will.Â We're going to be fine.

We still have like 25 minutes.


Ahh! Ella!


Well, the gnome is not where it was.


but you can't just accuse
your neighbor without proof.

He's been eyeing it
since the day I got it.

Look, it's a vintage Heissner.

Oh.
I just know he took it.

Okay, but just knowing and proving
are two different things.

Incontrovertible proof
is the basis of our legal system.

If you get some proof,
just give me a call at my firm. Okay?

And we'll see what we can do.

Wait. Here.

Take it.

[Tom chuckles]

Happy Fourth!


Well, we've accomplished
some amazing legal work today.

Oh yeah.

It's time for vegan hot dogs.
Stop. Stay.

We're just getting started.

Come on, Tom. Look at all the fun
people are having out there.

Cute guys for me, cute gals for you.
We should be mingling.

You're not supposed to work on a holiday.

You get paid for work.
This is volunteering.

This is you volunteering
and me getting wrangled-in, as usual.

That's the spirit.
[snaps fingers]



Um, is the show still on schedule?

I think so.
We'll probably go on at around 12:30.


Thanks, Mom.

Everyone ready?

Let's go run the dance a few times
before we go on.

[Ella sighs]


[Ella humming]

[man 1]
The kids want to go play on the slide.

[man 2] Hey, happy Fourth of July.
[woman] Oh, happy Fourth of July.

Marissa?

Mom?

Oh, no.

Tom.

Hi.

Are you okay?

I can't find my mom.

Oh, well,
I could try to help you find her.

Um, she's not dressed
like a bumblebee too, is she?

No, just like a regular person.

Right. Um...

All right, well, I have a booth here,

so why don't we just get out
of that crowd for a second, yeah?

gonna offer me candy, right?


I mean, I wouldn't mind some candy.
Okay.

No, Tom.
[Tom] What?

We're not suing any parents
for a later bedtime.

No, she doesn't need legal advice.
She needs a lost mom.

I'm gonna go see
if there's like a lost kid booth.

I'll go.
[Tom] What?

You stay here in case her mom comes back.
You're not going to get a hot dog, right?


I might get a lemonade too.

Hey, well, have them
make an announcement if you can't find...

We'll just wait here until he comes back,
I guess, all right?

I'm Tom.
I know.

You're not going to sting me, are you?
I don't have a stinger.

Oh, thank goodness.

My dance studio is performing.

Oh, yeah. Why don't I just take you there?

I don't know where they went.
Oh, not to the stage?

Not until later.


Um, let's just wait
and see what Assan can find out.

Um, what happened here?

It broke somehow.
Let me see.


to say that you're going to do something
and then actually do it?

Oh, you know, that's not exactly
a part of Robert's operating system, so...

Never was.

Mm.

[dramatic music]

Hold this.

[tender music]

Hello?
Hi.

Uh...

Do you need legal advice?
I do not, but you might.

I'm sorry?

Why is my daughter in your booth?
Mom!

[Tom] This is your daughter?
Yeah, pretty sure.

Are you okay?

I got lost.
She was just wandering around, and...

His friend went to go look for you,
and he fixed my headband.

Oh.

Okay, well, that was very nice of you.

I'm just glad you're both back together.

We should probably go find Marissa.

Do you want to go see my dance?

Oh, um...

Uh...

They go on at 12:30,
I mean, if you're free.

Uh, yes, I would love
to come see your dance.

Cool.
Okay. Well, thanks.

Sure.
Mm-hmm.

That was weird.

What are the odds?

There was nobody there.
Nobody where?

The hot dog stand or the lost and found?

They were right next to each other.
Buck 99.


Tom, you lost the kid!

[dance music playing]

[music ends]
[applause]

Yay! Ella!




Did you lose another child?

No.

Well, if you're looking for the booth guy,
he's right over there.


He came.


You should go, uh, thank him.

I already did.

You should go thank him again.

And this time
do a little hair flip or two.

Ella's coming.
I've got Ella. You go.

Go.

Go.

Hair flip.

Yes.

That's cute.

[indistinct chatter]

Sure.

You came.

Yeah, I mean, I said I was going to come,
so I couldn't just not show up.

Right.

I wanted to properly thank you again
for taking care of my daughter.

Yeah.
It was really nice of you.

And I'm sorry
if I thought you were a creep.

I get it.

There's a lot of child abduction booths
this year.

It's weird.
[laughs]

So, um, what was your booth for again?

It was free legal advice. I'm a lawyer.

So you are a creep.

[forced laugh]

No, I'm one of those rare good lawyers.


I'm Tom.

Lisa.

What do you do, Lisa?

Uh, I'm a writer.


to stay for the fireworks?

Yeah, wouldn't miss it.

I know a great place to watch them from.
We usually go to...



I'm surprised that we haven't
seen each other there before.

Maybe we didn't know
what we were looking for.


Oh, that's purple.
That was a good one.

I liked that that one's purple.
Mm-hmm.

So...

Do you have a favorite restaurant?

Yes.

I said yes,

and that's what brought me to Denver.

Well, I'm glad you're here.

Oh.

I guess someone's
trying to give us a hint.

[uplifting music]

Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!

Ella, slow down!


[blows whistle]

You missed.

[uplifting music]

[no audible dialogue]

There you are.


I love you.

I love you too.

Mm.
Mm.

I love you too.


Oh.

Good night.
Good night.

[joyous music]


I don't think
I've ever seen you this happy before.

It has been pretty magical.

Mm-hmm. And oh, God,
Ella loves Tom so much.

I know, right?
Mm-hmm.

So what am I not seeing?

What do you mean?

Well, he can't be this perfect,
so what am I missing?

Uh-uh, Lis.

I am not going to let you
talk yourself out of this love story.

I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

Oh! God!

Whoa! Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Are you okay?

Yeah, I... I...
It just surprised me, that's all.

You can never
go too big on Christmas, right?

Hmm.

Yeah. Come on, girl.

Right. Thank you.
I got you.

Merry Christmas.

Maybe I should put that
in my Christmas article.

Wait, Grant has you writing an article
about Christmas?


I can't wait to see how that turns out.

Oh. That's sweet.


Hi. Assan.


Is everything okay?

Absolutely, ladies.
Here, let me take your coats.

Okay.

We're going to get these back, right?

Of course.
Tom just wants you to be comfortable.

Oh, okay.
Well, you're scaring me a little.

You have no idea.
What does that mean?

Welcome to Christmas.

AreÂ we in the right place?

[dramatic music]

[train whistle blows]

Hey. Sorry, guys.
I was running late. Welcome.

<i>- Ho, ho, ho, ho!</i>
[Sharon laughs]

<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

Hi, Sharon.
Hi.

Hi. Merry Christmas.

Yeah, um, what is going on?
Is this for real?

It's for real, every bit of it.

Yeah, whatever contest you entered,
you won it.

[Sharon and Tom laugh]

No, it's just to celebrate the season.

Hmm.

Show them the photo wall.
Oh, yeah, come this way.

[plays festive music]

Yeah, I got this whole setup here.

We thought we could do some poses
with, like, props and things,

and Santa himself.

Okay, #NorthPoleFever.

Are you guys pranking me?

<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

Sharon, are you in on this?

Don't look at me.


You don't like it?

I kind of famously don't like it.

Have we not talked about this?

No, that's... That's something
I would have remembered you saying.

You do this every year?

Yeah.

But who's it for?

Me. And you guys tonight.
I mean, mostly just 'cause it's Christmas.

And as a reminder
to keep the spirit of the season alive.

Couldn't you just put a Post-It note
on the fridge?

[all laugh]

Think of this as one massive Post-It note.

Okay, but isn't it expensive?

No.

Yeah. If you added everything up,
I guess it's a lot of money.

But I've had most of this stuff
since I was a kid.

I don't buy all-new decorations
every year.

Yeah, but it's still
Christmas-moving merchandise.

I mean, would anybody
ever have a nutcracker

or a stuffed reindeer
if it wasn't for Christmas?

No, but you don't need
to spend money to decorate, right?

I have a bunch
of homemade decorating ideas.

Right? It's just about the spirit.

Is this the work project
you had this weekend?

Yeah. I mean, this was the fun part.

The hard part was getting my work stuff
organized and up to the office.

Why didn't you just tell me?

I wanted to surprise you.

Well, you did.

I put the whole train together.

Hmm. I hope Tom gave you a sticker.

[Sharon chuckles]

Now wait, it's not just decorations,
all right?

Christmastime is also
about all the different holiday events.

There are so many things
going on around town. Here, look.

I am sure you guys
have been to some of them.

I've been to all of them.

[both laugh]

I mean, there's tree lighting,
Christmas carol singing,

holiday productions.

It's fun just to walk around town
and take in Christmas energy.

Is it?

Okay, look, I get it.
You don't like Christmas.

But let me show you how fun it can be.

Well, I guess Ella
will enjoy a couple of these.

Oh.

So is Ella with her dad tonight?

Yep, they have a big cardboard
sledding competition coming up.

I bet I know what the key is. Duct tape.

What? Duct tape?
[Assan] You know what they say?

If duct tape can't solve your problem,
you're not using enough duct tape.

Oh, I will pass that along.
[laughs]

[oven timer dings]
Oh! But wait, there's more.

Ah, more food?

[Tom] Yeah.
Oh, boy.

Anyone for pumpkin pie?

[Assan] I'll find room.
I will too.

Move over, rice balls.


Bye.
Bye.

[driver] Are you here for Pasha?
Yeah. I'm Lisa.

So, Lisa, not a fan of Christmas.

I sensed that.

Well, if she survives it, anyway.

Hmm.

I noticed you didn't mention Santa.
Oh, that's not a hill I'm ready to climb.

Maybe I can get her to like it.


What the... Are you okay?

Yes, we're fine. Sorry about that.
Just keep driving.

She's just working some things out.

My boyfriend loves Christmas.

My boyfriend.
Yeah, did not see that coming.

What I supposed to do now?

Just break up
and then get back together in January?

You and Tom are like the dream couple.
You can handle a bit of Christmas fun.

Oh, that was not fun.

That was weird.

I mean, all the decorations,
all that time.

He took three straight days
to do that place.

Well, we know that Tom
can get hyper-focused.

That's the lawyer side of him.

And the guy who never has time
to do stuff on the weekdays

now has all this time
to do Christmas stuff?

That's the beauty of it.

And all that stuff
that he was talking about at dinner,

and the sleigh rides,
and the Christmas movies, whatever,

you're going to get
to see each other every single day.

To celebrate Christmas.

Yeah, well, that's the challenge.

And I know just how we're gonna
have you jump right into the deep end.

Give me your phone.

Give me your phone.

Thank you.


[train whistle blows]

Oh, I'm good.

Yeah, thanks for the help, Spielberg.

I did the train.

[scoffs] Yeah.
[cell phone chimes]

That's Lisa.

Oh. Sorry, buddy.

You guys had a good run.

No, she wants me to show her
some of my homemade decorating ideas.

[cell phone chimes]

"Tomorrow with Ella after school.
I want to give Christmas a chance."

Huh. That is not the vibe
I got as they were leaving.

Well, that's the Christmas magic at work.

All right, I got to go to my storage unit
in the morning,

pick up my backup ornaments.
I can use those for her tree,

because that is still technically
not spending any money.

You got work tomorrow.

I can call in sick.


You're gonna call in sick?

Yeah, why? Wait, how do you call in sick?

Do you call the nurse's office?

Do we have a nurse's office
at my law firm?

Call your assistant.

Yes. I'm gonna call my assistant.

Tom.
Yes?

Take a breath here.
[inhales sharply]

Bigger.
[inhales]


Just write back to Lisa.

Oh, right. Yes.

Writing back to...

Okay.

Well?

He's in for tomorrow.

A Monday.

Tomorrow night?

All day.
Ah!

Hallelujah!
You girls scream too much.

But Pasha, it's Christmas.


[festive music]

[Lisa gasps]
Hey.

T-Tom.

Lisa, you're leaving?

I thought you were coming at 11:00.

Sorry, I was up,
and then the storage place was open,

and I got moving,
and I thought if you were up early...

I have to go into the office.

You're not working from home today?

We have a staff meeting.


Are we going to use all of that?

Um, there's two more crates by the car.

Are you gonna be okay here by yourself?

Oh, absolutely. Yes.

No, I still need to go through
all these backup ornaments that I got.

And do you have any ornaments?
Oh. Yeah.

We should see how many we have total.
That's my Christmas box right there.

Great. I will go through the box
and the ornaments.

You go to work. Don't worry about it.

All right. There is some coffee left.
Do you have cocoa?

Since when do you drink hot chocolate?
Cocoa?

That is one of the many joys of Christmas.

Oh, okay. No, I don't have cocoa.

I will grab some.

Okay.
Okay.

Mwah! Off to work I go.

Off you go.

Mm-hmm.

We need more clicks.
We're not... Nobody's opening us up.

And if nobody opens us up,
then we don't come to work.

So we want them to see something

that makes them want to stay there
and then go to the next thing.

<i>- Lisa, you with us?</i>
Yup. Yes, Grant.

Great. So we got to come up
with some new ideas.

[faint rattling]


Somebody threw out something
about this hipsters' climbers club.

I mean, and what the hell,
Glenn's obsession with ASMR.

I don't even know what that's about.

I'm glad he didn't come in today.
I was going to...


<i>One man's obsession,</i>

<i>one woman's nightmare.</i>

Ta-da! Cocoa.

Wow, that's fancy.

I put the tiniest little bit of nutmeg
in it to give it a kick.

I have nutmeg?
I grabbed a whole one while I was out.

You gotta grind it fresh
or it loses its flavor.

Oh, is that, right?
That is right.

Well, it's not your mom's hot chocolate.

Oh, no, no. It is cocoa.

Mmm. Wow.
Oh!

That is delicious.
Okay. Okay.

Can I show you what I've been up to?

Yeah, lead the way.
Come on.

So...

ornaments all ready to hang.

Had to add a hook to a few of them.

And the lights.
I checked all the strands for dead bulbs.

You don't want any surprises there.
Good.

Oh, and then a tree, I thought I could
clear a spot right here in the corner.

Yeah.
Right? All right. Come here.

And project station,
ready to make decorations by hand.

You've been busy.


Everything good at work?

Yeah, I got an article
that's giving me a little trouble.

Oh.

You know what?
Ella's out of school at 3:00.

Should we get some lunch?
Yeah. Perfect.

Finish your cocoa and we'll head out.

[romantic music]

[no audible dialogue]

So you never had any fun
with your family at Christmas?

Hmm. My parents
never really had fun, ever.

Maybe it's because none of them
was wearing this.


[upbeat music]



[bells jingling]

No. Mm-mm.
Jingle?

This is pretty great.
Look at this. For me.

Oh. And I know a place
that does Christmas cupcakes,

where they take the icing...

Here, sorry, just walk on this side.
It's a pretty dangerous neighborhood.

Get him!
Whoa! Get back.

Duck! All right, go!

Go, go, go, go, go!

Ha-ha! Not today, Freckles!


So, have you thought
about your Christmas list for Santa?

I have a few ideas.

Like what?

An iPhone.
[Tom] Ha.

Oh, I don't think that the elves
have iPhone technology.

They can make an iPhone.

Uh, I'm pretty sure
they don't make iPhones at the North Pole.

They can make anything you want
at the North Pole.

Oh, um, Tom, go with me here.

I heard there's an age limit for iPhones.

Santa said it was 11.

Eleven?

Oh, um, Santa doesn't bring presents
to kids older than 10.

Not the point, Tom.

I heard that he thinks eight
is too young for an iPhone.

Oh, yes, right.

Well, your mom is right.
Santa knows everything about you,

and he can't bring you a present
that you're not ready for.

Fine.

Fine. All right, come on.
Let's get a tree. Let's go.

You want a tree for your house
that's about six feet tall.

So I'm going to say that's these here.

So this is our first possibility.

Now I just need an inspector
to walk around

and make sure there's no dead spots.

On it.

Okay.
[Lisa laughs]

Check that back.
That's how they get you sometimes.


It's perfect.

Then we have picked our tree.
I love it.

But wait, it's not done yet.
You guys ever been flocked?

Who knew?

That is so cool.

What else can we flock?


Just the tree today.

All right,
we have to leave it here overnight to dry,

but we can go get
all of our ornaments ready

so we can decorate it tomorrow.

Yeah? All right. Come on.

["Jingle Bells" playing]

[no audible dialogue]


[no audible dialogue]

Oh, there it is. That's it.

"The Grinch had been caught
by this little Who daughter

who'd gotten out of bed
for a cup of cold water."

"And she looked at the Grinch and said..."

[in high-pitched voice]
"Santa Claus, why?"

"Why are you taking
my Christmas tree? Why?"

"But you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick."

<i>"He thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick."</i>

<i>"Why, my sweet little tot..."</i>

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.


That was quite a day.

Did you like it?

I have to admit I did.

Yeah?

Yeah. But mostly because we were together,

and we always have fun
when we're together.

Yeah, but Christmas makes it more magical.

Christmas made it happen on a Monday.

Right.
[chuckles]

Oh, hey, there is, um,
one more thing that I made

that I haven't shown you yet.

Oh, boy. What else?

This.

Huh.

What is it? Cilantro?

Mm-mm. This is mistletoe.

Oh. I've heard of it.

Mm-hmm.

We supposed to do something?
Mm-hmm.

It is a merry Christmas.

[both chuckle]

[festive music]

That came in after I left,
so no, I did not do that.

Okay, just put it on my desk.
I'm gonna take a look in the morning.

[Santa statue laughs]

<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

<i>Don't forget to leave
a carrot for Rudolph.</i>

Flock yeah.



Oh, Tom, your coat.
Yeah?

Ew! Looks like I've been flocked.


Last one. That was the last one, promise.

Come on in.
[Tom] Okay.

I don't need any help. Wow. No. I got it.


This was me when I was, like, your age.



That's when I still let Nana Joy cut it.

Oh. That's cute.

Is Santa Claus is real?

What? Of course, he is.

This boy at school says he's not,

that it's just your parents
buying you presents.

Why does he think that?

His brother told him.

Oh. Brothers.

What's this boy's name?

Connor.

All right, well,
let's say that you're Santa

and Connor doesn't believe in you.

Would you want to bring him something?

How could he not believe in me?
I'm a real person.

Yeah. Well, so is Santa, all right?
So if Connor doesn't believe in Santa,

is SantaÂ gonna want
to bring him a present?

I guess not.
Yeah, so that's a problem for Connor.

But that is not a problem for you.

Not as long as you believe.

I'll make a list just to be safe.

I think that's a great idea.

Ready? Three, two, one.

I love it.

That's the prettiest tree we've ever had.

[tender music]

<i>â™ª Oh, magical lights â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If you will be with me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A mistletoe night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm hoping you'll kiss me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Play music tonight â™ª</i>

Ooh. She's out.

Ah.

<i>â™ª Like the snow from the night sky
I'm falling so quickly â™ª</i>

Me?



Writer's block.

You spent all week celebrating Christmas

and you still can't figure out
what to write?

I'm more confused than ever.

Hmm.

We spent a week
doing all these fun things,

but why does this one holiday
have to be so freaking important?

Lisa.
Yes, Grant?

Christmas article.

Oh, just trying to get it perfect, boss.

Well, Santa Claus is coming to town,
and I got ads to sell.

Cha-ching. Let's have it.

You got it.

And that's why he has resting Grinch face.

[festive music]

So then Ella asked
how Scrooge died but didn't die.

She may have missed a few plot points,
but I think she got the idea.

No, she loved it.

[Tom] Yeah, yeah.
[Assan] Oh, that's awesome.

No offense, Tom,

but I was ready for a year off
from <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

Oh, offense taken.
[laughter]

On behalf of me and Ebenezer.
He's very sensitive.


This whole week has been
super eye-opening.

Oh, look at you, getting your Santa on.
Okay, I'm proud of you.

Thank you.
[laughs]

Oh my gosh, and Tom,

thank you for talking
to Ella about Santa Claus.

I always dread that conversation.

How come?

Well, I don't want to rob her
of the fun of believing in Santa,

but I feel bad lying to her

and I don't want her
to get teased at school

for still believing.

so bad in the third grade.

There was this uppity rich girl,
Jennifer Alerdese,

who controlledÂ the whole class.

So when she stopped believing,
everybody else had to too.

I was the lone holdout that Christmas.

So tragic.

Oh, poor little baby Sharon. I'm sorry.

I know, right? Oh God.

[all laugh]

But what if he is real?


Yeah, what if the believers are right

and the doubters are wrong?

Like in third grade?
No, like always.

That Santa Claus is real?

Yeah.


No, for real.

Tom.

Uh-oh.

Okay, so you think that there's a real guy
who travels around the world in one night

and brings presents to everybody?

Well, just to children, but yes.

You can't be serious.

You believe that there's a guy
who lives in the North Pole

and has elves making toys.

Yep. All that.

But that's not possible, Tom.

That's why kids stop believing,
because they start to understand the logic

and it doesn't make sense.

It's not about logic. It's about magic.

Oh, so you think that magic is real?

Christmas magic. Yeah.

Okay, let's just go with it.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.
[Lisa] Yeah.

So you believe that this guy has a sleigh

and it's pulled by reindeer.

Yes.

Reindeer can fly?

Yes, through Christmas magic.

And he has a sack
that's full of millions of toys?

Yes, he does.

Because of Christmas magic.
Couldn't happen without it.

I just really can't tell
if you're being serious or not.

Okay, how does he get around
the entire world in one night?

And don't just say "Christmas magic."


That's part of it, though.

But also, he obviously lives
in a different version of time than we do.

What's that now?
Well, think about it.

He can get around the world in one night.

He lives longer than any other person.

That's just about the concept of time.

He lives in one model of time
and we live in another.

I thought you were the guy
who makes a living dealing in rules

and proof and logic.

Yes. Let's talk logic, right?
Let's look at it from your side.

What you're saying is
there's a completely made-up story

that over 2 billion people agree on?

And that every parent in America

is part of some
vast conspiracy to perpetuate a lie,

but the exact same lie.

All right, that seems a lot less logical

than there's a real person
with Christmas magic that we celebrate.

Yeah, but not everybody
celebrates Christmas.

In most of the world, they do.

Assan, you're a Muslim.
Do you have something to add here?

I fought this fight years ago.
You're on your own.

Assan celebrates Christmas.
Oh, I'm pretty sure he doesn't.

He doesn't celebrate Christmas
as a religious holiday.

I'm talking about Santa's Christmas.

All right, when you find yourself

humming along
to a Christmas carol on the radio,

you're celebrating Christmas.

When you go to a holiday party
or make plans to see family,

you're celebrating Christmas.

Those are just holiday things
that we can't escape.

I mean, "escape" suggests
that we're all trapped somehow.

But we're not.
We look forward to Christmas every year.

It's the one thing
that brings everybody together.

And you're trying to tell me
that a unifying energy like that,

a global presence
that transcends country and religion

isn't because of a real person?

Well, I think Santa
as a spirit of Christmas is real,

like you obviously do.
[Tom] I do, yes.

But I'm not making a joke.

I believe in Santa Claus.


Are you okay?
Yeah, she'll be fine.

Don't worry about her. Just keep driving.

Okay, we're fine. Go ahead. Drive.

My boyfriend believes in Santa Claus.

My wife believes in astrology.

Not talking to you.
Sorry.


This is totally insane.

Okay, I mean,
he did make some good points in there.

It makes you think.

No, no, Sharon, not you too.
You want me just to be okay with this?

Well, you said yourself
that you had a great week with Tom.

Yeah, with Tom and Santa.


Oh God, now I have two people
to convince that Santa isn't real.

She didn't storm out.

She didn't like it, though.

No one likes it, Tom.

That's hoping for too much.

I thought you liked it.

I like you, buddy.
The whole Santa thing is... whatever.

So you think I'm crazy, too.

No, I didn't say that.

Look, if we'll never really know
if Santa is real,

then I'm happy to believe with you,
for you, for us being friends.

I don't have the same conviction you do

because it's not that important to me
either way.

So what do I do? I have the tree lighting
on the schedule for Monday.

Well, sometimes
you have to adjust your schedule

to consider other people's needs.

You want to write
a killer article about Christmas?

I think you just found your in.

No, I don't think I can take it.

No, don't run away. Go deeper.

There's so much more to unpack here.

This is better than an article
that writes itself.

It can be written by Santa.

Bottom line is, you love her.
I do.

And she loves you.
I hope.

So then have some faith
that she'll accept you for who you are.

I will try to have some faith.

All right.
Yes. Thank you.

Hey, that's what elves are for.

Yeah. You're the best.

Good night.
Night.

So how does the tree lighting
figure into Christmas magic?

Oh, we have to keep
the Christmas spirit alive.

That's where Christmas magic comes from.

By putting lights on a tree?

Twinkle lights
are the fireworks of Christmas.

We look at these things every day,
a tree, a house, a lamppost.

But then one month out of the year,

they are covered in a beautiful glow
of color and light,

and we look at our world a whole new way.

It's that childlike wonder
that makes the magic.

[cheers and applause]

They're so awesome.
Yeah.

Thank you all for coming out tonight.
I think we should light this sucker up.

[man] Yeah!
Hit it, Ben!

[all cheer]

Yes! No problem!

[joyous music]

[Tom sighs]


Get him!

Ha!

You got it!

Okay. Look, there's... Look at the elf.

Ho, ho, ho! Look at Eflie. Ho, ho, ho!

Elfie is so sweet. Oh, look at Elfie.

Oh, no.

[chuckles]
[baby shrieks]

Is that kid gonna kill Santa Claus?

She might kill that one,
but the real one will be fine.


Hello. Ho, ho, ho.

Thank you.
Oh, it's okay.

Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

Ho, ho. Hello. Come on up. Hi.

Hi.
Ho, ho, ho. What's your name?

I'm Ella.
Nice to meet you, Bella.

What would you like for Christmas?

I would like an iPhone.

An iPhone. Oh, my!

You know why Santa's
never going to die, Tom?

Why is that?

Because he's the poster child
for spending money at Christmas.

I mean, all of these stores
that sell toys and cards

and Lexuses with big bows on it
aren't going to let their point man go.

Yeah.
I mean, not when everyone

is counting presents
to see how happy their Christmas is.

But what I'd really like is...
Yeah? What's this?

Oh!

Companies are gonna do
what they're gonna do,

but thinking about that moment,
watching someone open the perfect present

and that look in their eyes.

That is just so awesome.

Yeah, but you don't have to believe
in Santa to gift one another.

Well, no, no, of course not.

Yeah. And shouldn't we be doing that
all year round?

Yes.

The thing about Christmas presents is,
they're always a surprise.

So I can't make any promises, okay?

You understand? Okay.
Mm-hmm.

Very good. Let's take a picture, okay?

Look at Sprinkles.
Ho, ho! Hello, Sprinkles.

Ho, ho, ho, ho.
[camera clicks]

Merry Christmas. Thank you so much.

Thank you, Santa.
[Tom] Thank you, Santa.

Thank you. Merry Christmas.
[Lisa] Merry Christmas.

Hmm.

Thanks, Mom.

Aww.

Okay, so, what did you ask Santa for?

Not gonna tell.

Why?

It's between me and the big man.

Ho, ho, ho!



What are Santa's three rules
for making a great garden?

What are Santa's three rules

for making a great garden?

Ooh!

You already got three?
Already done. Trust me on this one.

Okay.

If you could see Santa,
that would prove it.

So have you seen Santa?
No.

No, you can't.

He's not going to come to your house
if you're up waiting for him,

trying to catch him
like he's trying to rob the place.

But if you can't prove it,
then why believe in him?

It's because you can't prove it
that you have to believe.

It takes faith
to believe in the unknowable.

Okay.

What if you're wrong?


I guess I'd rather be wrong
having faith in something wonderful

than wrong
because I didn't have any faith.

[woman imitating train whistle]

Answer coming through!

[imitating train chugging]

The three rules from Santa
for making a great garden:

ho, ho, ho!
[laughter]


Got it. Got it.

If you said that, you were right.

You got it. Congrats.


["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" playing]

[oven timer dings]


Watch fingers.

Perfect!

Boom.


One more batch?

That was the last batch, honey.

Just one more?


You did great, kiddo.

[oven timer dings]
Here.

Now, go brush your teeth
and I will come and check on you.


Hmm.

How many more batches, Tom?

Uh, let's see,
I got six more ready to go in the oven,

and then about four more?

Enough dough for four more after that.

Oh. Okay.

Just, I got to make sure
I have enough for everyone on my list.

Your list? Right. Yeah.

[sniffles and sighs]

Hey, did you ever find out
what Ella asked Santa for?

No, she wouldn't tell me,
but if I had to guess,

it starts with an "I"
and ends with a "phone."

[Tom laughs]

Poor thing.

I have all kinds of things
that I think she'll really like.

Yeah, but it's still good
that she let Santa know what she wants.

Santa doesn't bring her any presents.
They come from me and Robert.

Not if she believes.


Um...

Maybe, could you not talk to Ella
about Santa anymore?

I think she's getting the wrong message.

That Santa Claus is real?

Yeah, that message.

So last week when I told her
Santa Claus was real,

you were fine with it
because you thought I was lying.

And now that it's the truth,
you don't like it.


I don't think it's the truth.

Well, don't rob Ella of her belief.

I'm not going to. I mean, not right now.

But there's gonna come a day,

and she's gonna ask,
and I'm gonna tell the truth...

I don't think it's fair for you
to put your lack of faith onto Ella.

Okay, Ella is my daughter, Tom.

Yes, that... You're right.

to make a big deal out of this.

I am sorry.
I just have to protect my kid.

I get it.

Tom, can you read me "The Grinch" tonight?

Oh, you know what? I gotta keep working.
But your mom can do it.

She's not as good at the Grinch voice.

Huh?
Well, thank you, but duty calls.

Fine.

Are you coming, Mom?

I'm not your mom. I'm the Grinch.

See?

I do.

Oh, I am the Grinch!
[Ella laughs]

I am the Grinch! I am the Grinch!

That's not a Grinch thing.

[Lisa shouting playfully]

[tender music]


[typing]
[Lisa] <i>Christmas.</i>

<i>If you're not on the bus, you're under it.</i>


[wistful music]

[wind rushing]

Oh my God.



I saw this and I thought of you.

It's...

great.

Um...

I'm gonna look so...

festive.

Yeah.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

Oh.


Ugh...

[cell phone chimes]



So how was work?

It was good. Busy.

Is Ella still here?
No, she left with Robert already.

I figured. I wanted to catch her,
because I put all my Christmas songs

on this flash drive for her.

Yeah, well, you can give it to her later.
Yeah.

Are we going to pound those
before you go get ready?

For what?

For the sleigh ride.

Oh, that's tonight?
Yeah.

I really thought you said it was Saturday.

No, tomorrow is the Christmas carol
sing-along.

The sleigh ride's tonight.

Oh, well, what if we just took a night off
from all things Christmas?

It's totally sold out.

So this is the only night we can go.

Yeah, but what if we didn't go?

I go every year.

Tom. Look at yourself. You're exhausted.

You can't keep burning
the Christmas candle at both ends.

I will be fine.

Okay. Well, I don't feel like going

and getting bundled up
to just freeze on a sleigh ride.

They have hot drinks,
and it's a pretty mild night.

Okay, Tom...
Once you get there,

you'll see it's really fun.

Okay, Tom, I said I don't want to go.

Yeah, but I planned on going.
So I feel like I really need to go.

Then go.

You're not coming?

I'm not.

Hey. You can't give up on Christmas now.

Okay, I'm not giving up, Tom.

I just need a break.

Christmas is a break.

This is when we all get
to be the better versions of ourselves.

Is that what this is?

The better version of Tom?

Yes.
All right, I thought so too.

Because I thought that you were,
you know, interrupting your work schedule

to make time to do Christmassy things
with me and Ella.

Well, now I realize that you
weren't making time for us.

You're making time for Santa.

Because it's a celebration.

No, Tom. It's an obsession.

It isn't all just joy and fun
and rainbows, okay?

To some of us,
it is empty rituals and broken promises,

and sometimes, Tom,

it really doesn't feel good.


Okay, when I was seven years old
I found a Barbie in my parents' closet.

It was supposed to be to me from Santa.

And when I told them about it,
they didn't give it to me.

They returned it and they blamed me
for ruining my own Christmas.

And Santa didn't show up again after that.

I'm sorry.
They put their precious rituals

ahead of that little girl's feelings.

And now it's happening again.

Oh.

Okay.


What can I do to make this okay?

You can't, Tom.

You can't just wave some magic
Christmas wand and make it all better.

We're just two very different people.

I don't think we should
keep seeing each other.

No, Lis.

That's not what I want.

I can't give you what you want, Tom.

So this is what I want.


Well, okay. Um...

You know what, this...
You can give that to Ella.

<i>â™ª Tried so hard to give you more time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because you were my crutch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª From sleeping in time â™ª</i>

told Lisa about Santa.

That's not true, buddy.

It's part of who you are.
That would've killed you.

Well, not being with her
is killing me more.

What exactly did she say?

I ruined our...

That I ruined everything because of Santa.

Are those the word she used?

No, I mean not exactly. But...

I got the message.

Maybe it's not about you.

Maybe she has
her own issues with Christmas.


Well, it's too late now.

Hi, friends.
Welcome to our Christmas sing-along.

[crowd applauds]

We're going to start with an old favorite,
"Jolly Old St. Nicholas."

And I want to hear everyone singing.

Lisa would've been
a much better fit for this.

Stop it.

[dramatic music]

[exhales]
[Sharon] I came as fast as I could.

What is the emergency?

Hi, Sharon.

Robert had to leave the country
on assignment.

And the sled race is Sunday.

Oh boy. I have not built
a lot of cardboard sleds in my life.

I told my mom to call Tom,
but she called you.

Tom is busy this week.

How do you know? You didn't even ask him.

I just know.

Okay, well,

what if you just get into a box
and then just slide down the hill? Hmm?

[knock on door]
[Tom] Come in.

Tom!
Yahoo!

Ella! Hi! Oh, yeah.

I missed you.
I missed you, too.

You got a project going?
A big one.

Okay, let me look into it here.
Let me see what we got, Sharon.


Oh my gosh!

This is so cool.

I love this.

Your place is awesome!

What's under that?

Mmm.
Uh, whoops.

How did this sheet get over Santa Claus?

You like it?
Wow. Does he do anything?

Great question.

<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!</i>

It's alive. Mm-hmm.

Can we play with the train?
Don't you have a project to do?

Yeah, and it's not good.

When is this race?

Sunday morning.

We're going to need a lot more duct tape.

What's this supposed to even look like?

["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" playing]

Merry Christmas!</i>


Grant, do you have a minute?

You want to talk to me?

Well, this ought to be good.

Is this about
your delinquent Christmas article?

Delinquent. Big word.

Well, I am an editor.

Hmm.

I don't think I can write it.
Not an option.

Grant. You know, me.
You know I don't like Christmas.

Why would you assign me this?


Lisa, I didn't want someone
to just write an article

about tinsel and eggnog.

I wanted someone with a very interesting
take on this whole thing.

And that is you.

Now, you hate Christmas.

I know. I get it.

But the whole rest of the world doesn't.

So, how do you meet in the middle?

Is that all you got?

I chose you for this
because I have faith in you.

I know you'll find it.

[tender music]


[doorbell rings]

Hey.
Hi!

Come on in.

Thank you for letting me come over.

Absolutely.

Whoa, that is delicious!

Brings back memories.

But I'll never be as good as my mom's.

Oh. I bet.

But I love it.

So...

Tom.

So... yeah.

Hmm.

I need some perspective.

How are you so okay with this?

You have to know, Tom was really worried
about telling you about Santa.

I mean, I knew Tom for three years
before he told me about him.

And I thought I kind of knew
everything there was about him,

and then he dropped this crazy bomb on me.

But it is crazy, though.

I thought so too at first.

But I don't want to judge him
on just this one thing.

I like being friends with him and...

I'm not saying it was easy
to have a friend believe in something

that no one else over the age of 10 does.
Right?

Then I thought about my life
as a Muslim in Denver, Colorado.

Most days, I'm surrounded by people
who don't believe the same things I do.

I see the look on some
of the people's faces

when they find out that I'm a Muslim.

As if my beliefs somehow
put me in the category of dangerous,

or evil, or weird,

or whatever
they associate that part of me with.

Once they put me in that box,

that's all I'm to them.

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

But Tom, he never did that to me.

He didn't care that my beliefs
were different from his, so...

How could I do that to him?

[inhales sharply]

I hear what you're saying, Assan,
but Santa isn't religion.

The only difference
between religion and Santa

is that as we getÂ older,
religious grown-ups

tell us that our faith
was right all along.

But they don't have proof either.

They just tell us that the stories
we believe are true.

But with Santa, the grown-ups are there
to tell you that the stories are not true.

And Tom just chose
not to believe the grown-ups.

You're a good friend.

So is he.

[dramatic music]

[cell phone ringing]

Hey, buddy, what's up?

What time is <i>The Nutcracker</i> tonight?

I got to load up on caffeine
about 30 minutes before.

Oh, we are not going.

What?

Wait a minute, who is this?
Please put Tom on the phone.

I can't.
I've got to work on Ella's sled race.

<i>She stayed way past her bedtime
and we still didn't finish it.</i>

The greatest Mouse King
to ever grace the stage

at Woodbury Elementary
is going to skip attending <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

You know my mom wrote that review.


What about your schedule?

<i>Assan, don't you know</i>

that sometimes you have
to adjust your schedule

to consider other people's needs?

Hmm. That sounds like
some real wisdom, buddy.

<i>One might even say genius.</i>

How's it coming?

Still in the assembly phase right now.

Haven't had a chance to test anything.

The race is tomorrow, isn't it?

Not helping.

Remember: duct tape.

I'm hanging up now.

"Santy Claus, why are you
taking my Christmas tree? Why?"


<i>Even the Grinch figured it out eventually.</i>

[uplifting music]


Hey, Ella!

Hi.
Hi.

The winning sled is ready to go.

Did you add more duct tape?
I put on every piece we had.


Did you borrow this from Santa Claus?

Ha-ha! No, but I did
get a little inspiration from him.

It looks great,

but we've never ridden in it before.

What if it falls apart?

What if?
You better give it a final inspection.

Okay, so I'm gonna head down
to the finish line, to get some pictures.

Good luck,Â y'all.

Stay warm.

Thank you for making time for this, Tom.

Ella is super excited.

She really loves it.

Well, it's the childlike wonder
that makes the magic.

Hmm.

Hey, I'm sorry
for putting Christmas before us.

I got a little crazy.

I wouldn't use the word "crazy."

But thank you.

[Ella] Inspection's all done, chief.
And?

She passed with flying colors.

Whoo-hoo! All right, get in there.
Let's see how she feels.

What do you think?

She feels perfect.
Yeah.

All right, let's do it.

Good luck. You're gonna need it.

Oh, Freckles.

Now we got to win.


Family sled race starts in one minute.

Are you gonna ride with us, Mom?
You should.

I was just going to watch from up here.

[Ella] Come on.
Yes, there's plenty of room.

Please, Mom.

Come on. I can help you.

I think you're gonna like it... ish.

All right, everyone squeeze up
to the front there.

I'm kind of eating my kneecaps here.

That's how she's designed.
Everything good up there, pilot?

Aye, aye, chief.

[both laugh]

So how do we get started?

Oh, um...

Am I in time?

You are, just barely.
She just asked about you.

[Lisa laughs]

All right, when she says "go," you push us
and then we'll do the hard part.

Uh, pushing is the hard part.

Riders, take your mark.

All right, everyone heads down.


Tom, I really don't know about this.

It's going to be okay.
It's a leap of faith.

No, it's a leap off of a literal mountain.


See you on the other side.

Riders ready?

And go!

[crowd cheering]


Whoa!

Ah, this is so scary!
[all laugh]

["Trepak" playing]


One sled left to catch!

We got 'em!

We can catch them if we take the jump.
Lean right.

[all scream and laugh]

Brace yourself!
Ah!


[crowd gasping]
Oh my God!

No!

[no audible dialogue]

Ah!

Come on!

[all laughing]
[crowd cheering]

Yes!


[Tom] Oh!
Yay!

We did it! Yes we...
We won!

Ah! They won!

[Lisa] We won!
[Tom] Yeah! We won!


Okay! Cheese!

I pushed them.

[tender music]


but not as good as yours.

Well, I'm gonna make you the cocoa
of champions when we get home

[all laugh]

Oh, I'll be talking
about this team forever.

We're legend.

Oh, yes, we are.
Yes.

Well, couldn't have done it
without a little push from Assan.

Thank you, Assan.

Ahem, um, I would like
to say something to everybody.

You're going to stand now?

This is pretty important. Yeah.

[Assan] Here it comes.
Okay.

Um, you all know that I love Christmas.

Understatement.

But this year I learned
that Christmas can come with challenges

as well as gifts,

and that it's the time of year to reflect.

But reflection can sometimes be painful.

But I know that I can embrace
whatever the season may bring.

And that it's spending time
with the people you love

that makes Christmas magical.

Not just decorations or holiday events.

Amen, brother.

Right.

[Assan chuckles]

Well, I want to say something too.

Oh, here it comes.

Yeah.

Um, well, you all know
I was a little reluctant about Christmas.

A little?


But, Tom, you have taught me

that it's not just
about strict traditions.

It can be fun again.

And there isn't always a Barbie
hiding in the closet to ruin everything.

A what now?
Don't stop her. She's on a roll.


Tom.

You did this thing for Ella.

Not because it was Christmas,

but because you love her and me.

And when we needed you most,
you were there all in.

And that's the kind of magic
that I want to believe in.


Amen, sister.

And that thing
that I said the other night,

could I take that back?

Please. Yes. Please.

I agree, yes, thank you.
Mmm.

Called it.

Yeah, it didn't take a genius.

But I have one more thing,
Oh, but I had one more thing.

Well, is your thing my thing?
I don't know what your thing is.

Maybe you just do your thing.
You should do your thing.

Someone do their thing.

You do it. You do it, please.


Tom, I don't ever want you
to lose your belief in Santa,

your love of Christmas.

Because you've taught me
how important it is

to believe in something
bigger than ourselves.

And something we can't prove.

And that every grown-up

should be able to tap into
that childlike wonder

that just makes life sweeter.

Oh.

Wait, they're not done yet.

Stay right there. Just gonna do my thing.

It's a different thing.
I knew it.


This is my wish list for Santa this year.

That's it.

This is everything I want.

It's us.

Ella, you are the coolest kid
I have ever met,

and I promise to always be your friend.

And Lisa.

I love you more than
I could even put into words.

So...

Instead, I am going
to take a leap of faith

that our love

and our future together
will be even bigger than Santa Claus.

Shut the front door.

Oh.

Lisa Ann Russell...

will you marry me?

I never expected my proposal
to include Santa Claus.


Yes! Yes.
[Tom] Yes? Oh good.


Yes! Whoo!


[Lisa laughing]


What?

Santa is real.

That's what I asked him for.

That you and Tom would get married.

And now you're gonna.

[uplifting music]

You can't argue with logic like that.


Come here. Come here.

Give me some of that. Aw.


Boom!

I did it! I am a man!

Ooh! Oh my God, I am sweating.
You feeling good? Yeah.

Every part of me.
Yeah.

Do you like it?
I love it.

Mwah.

Well, everything's wrapped.

Yeah.
And we're ready for tomorrow.

It looks amazing.

Now we just have to go to bed
and see what Santa brings.

Tom.
Lisa.

You can believe that,
and I love you anyway.

And you cannot believe that,
and I love you anyway.

Hmm.

A whole crate of this waiting for you

in my bedroom.
Oh.

I love cilantro.

Wait for me!
