Where I see myself in ten years ...

~ Notorious ~
Made By ~KrAzYLeGz~

Los Angeles, California.

8 March 1997.

Just expect you to listen to the album.
Congratulations.

Yes!

B.I.G., let's change the world.

Let's go!

We returned.
We returned.

Back to the top.

What are you, fetiÃ¾o?
What are you doing?

Hi, boys.

You are moved to, gagico!
Give me your phone number?

In the beginning God he has tarnished the
face in a clean way.

But you knew that I can stay "clean"
where I grew up.

If you are a regular and nuit and job

you flout
gangsters in the making

and white fetiÃ¾elor
courtyard of the school.

Want to see the last magazine?
Great to see you take!

Top faimo May and
five cÃ¢ntÃ£reÃ¾i!

Kurtis Blow is the best!

Hi.

Want an autograph from
which will appear in a day in the magazine?

Christopher will not appear
in any magazine.

It is fat, black and boor.

I do not even wear braces.

Well.
Watch it and learned a lot ...

always gives everything you best
and look what happens. Note 10.

We are proud of you, Chrissy Pooh.
I tell you a.

I forgot.
Now you're big.

Mom came from a time he's in Jamaica
where night is allow parties door unlocked.

But in our neighborhood
the only time I let you roam

was when I went home
from school.

You want to see something different?

That was Brooklyn, "are the residency or die"
"Best as the pan.

And his mother could not protect me
even all that shit.

Hi.

Christopher ... welcomes your father.

Sugar.

$ 100?
Just so worth?

Have you even
to be part of his life?

Things are complicated.
Things!

Us feel that we could ...

It was easy to minÃ¾i I wife.
But when it comes to about your son ...

things are complicated.

Bye.

You forgot something.

Will not come back, right?

No, I think.

Good, good!

Come here.

We'll be fine.
Only two of us.

<i>You  not me you're father. </ i></i>

<i> You are just a nigga fiÃ¾oasÃ£. </ i></i>

<i> Mom I do not want money
So you run. </ i></i>

<i> It hurts me
because you must recognize you ...</ i></i>

<i> I need you in my life
because you're nothing! </ i></i>

At that point I decided
stop being a child gander.

I knew that life is a miserable game.

And you knew that D-Roc was sufficiently
fucking like to go learn the rules.

Howzit, D-Roc?

He left in the end your mother
to exit?

I told you I'll come.
Do not keep me locked in her house.

So you're ready to go
among the mecherilor?

What should I do?

You remember you.
Behave yourself like baÃ¾i cuba.

Phone rings.

That bastard is alesese
with the first dose of the day

and I'm alesesem with money
from my first sale.

When I was about 17 years ...
was not an ordinary boy and nuit.

I was paid.

Still asleep, Christopher?

How are you, Christopher?

Pray?

Just to buy
a frog on the door.

Do not fool with it.

You do not believe that God has felt humor?

Must have
if he did you.

For asculÃ¾i always this rubbish
country music?

I like this kind of music,
are some stories are beautiful.

Who spoke on the phone
last night?

With Jane.

It is perfectly normal
as a mother to feel jealous ...

when her baby is interested
of another woman.

To God ...
Stay, mother.

What?
How much like a scavenger pan?

Any $ 28,000 per year. Why?
No reason.

You can not rush the late
both classes?

You must see this weekend.

3x other term in the equations.
Who can solve the problem?

Stand up, Mr Wallace.

7x = 84
X = 12

Impressive, you're smarter
than you look.

Mr. Welber told me yesterday
I get that scavenger.

Yes.

If you chiuse from school
that you get.

I learned that a teacher
As pan $ 24,000 a year ...

and a scavenger like the frying pan
$ 28,000 per year.

I bring you with 4000 $
more than him.

Exit out of my class!

Thank you that I expected you to.
I knew that you'll like.

If mom sees phone bill
I will kill you.

When you see all those phones ...

I'm pregnant.

I went and the doctor.

We have a baby!

Damn!
Hell?

That's all?

I'm waiting to enjoy fashion,

but if I knock this world
then I apologize.

Sit down, dear.
To talk.

My son segment,
you're my whole world.

I not going to say "fuck"?

No, I do.
You'll know that we care about you.

We take care of me?
You are my girlfriend.

Hi, D-Roc.
What's up?

You are OK?
Yes, well.

To make money.

D-Roc and I work very well
together.

Street and 40 was our field.

But once in a while D-Roc said:
"put a little"?

Traffic was my wife.

Rap was an occasional lover.

Before my account is gone
news about what I can skin,

and a least you named Primo
I provoked a duel.

Everyone was moved to him,
not because they never lost.

One was to do for lyrics
ga, and that your

Battle but this was something else.

I see that no longer run.
Better 'n you meliÃ¾a wrong.

Come on, clear it away.
That want to see?

I want to see me
and the "Big Boy"?

I'm MC Quess.
That 's me, MC Quess.

We know who will like the pan.
Hey, DJ, a cool place.

You missed last month
20 days of school.

Look, Mom. I tried.

But then I was three full weeks.
They come in two "careers day".

An IT and a doctor.
And there were some losers Ã®mpuÃ¾iÃ¾i!

Take care how you talk!

I do not see me going to school
and that reaching them!

Now I have something to do.

What the hell does that mean?

Jane is pregnant.
I will be father.

Please tell me
not that you're so stupid.

Why?

Because you're still a Baietel!

To think that I came to the U.S.?

I like to spend every day
taking care of you,

feeding back and curÃ£Ã¾Ã¢nd
piureul potatoes left under the bed?

You can not take care of you no Ã®nsuÃ¾i!
How can you care for a child?

Where is the plate?

I threw her to the dogs,
it was disgusting!

Damn!
What are you doing?

That was not mashed potatoes!
Damn!

Look at me!

I said to you uiÃ¾i at me!

Trying to tell me what I think?

I like to get those vagrants neisprÃ£viÃ¾i

Vagabonzii not lanÃ¾uri and no money!
I am man!

I think that makes you to be man?

Exit out.
Mother?

Exit out.

I was not the man
that his mother and wanted to become.

It's so shit.

Then after you become husband
I felt that it should be.

<i> When you die

I got tired of work and mÃ£runÃ¾i,

Scosesem 40 Â° bevel on the streets.

Look at you, you're a man.

Shut the fuck up
and look out the door a.

<i>You  a call to reverse the fee

Mother?
Damn you, Christopher.

I did a sheep.
I need your help.

No. Alone you put into it,
all alone can solve.

You can not even

I have never ceased

but you must stop to consume more are
while God

Close your eyes, Christopher.

When passing through the valley of shadows morÃ¾ii ...
When passing through the valley of shadows morÃ¾ii ...

because you are with me
rod and rod Ta me chuckle.

I am ready to accept
the presence of my Lord.

Whether that goodness and His mercy
to reverse on me.

Alone you put into it,
all alone can solve.

For the first time in my life
I felt dead.

I started to write
because they simply bore me

Then my own thoughts
were turned into lyrics ...

and those lyrics
said my story.

Christopher, have a fetita.

<i> I know how it was done to wake up </ i></i>

<i> .. seller ... sold. </ i></i>

<i>How is  to be father
When you pay bills ...</ i></i>

Welcome home.

Look who came back.

We know now that you're daddy.

It's your daddy?
What are you, a white fetita?

Thank God

Look who's here.
What are you doing?

I hope that you remember you
how to smoke it.

Sure.
I like to watch.

Now that you exit it from the cooler,
what are you going to do?

That had a daughter I had
I think I can change.

I did something important.

But if I could maintain the

I will do what it does normally.

He's not Wesley.

Bring it on humans.

Please, bring him inside.

They are Biggie Smalls, Mr. C, and D-Roc.

Take place.

Omu 'My said
I love your record.

I know what you did for
Johnny and Mary C.

And we have many lyrics in his head.
You understand what I say?

What is your theme?

I want to tell you stories about blacks
in Brooklyn, understand?

What kind of life going.

Still sell drugs?

I'm not a gangster, just trying to make money.

My business has contact with the streets,
but is not in the streets.

And no I do not want artists who are to reach
to prison after signed the contract.

If you help me get money and frumo,
Put me.

Do not run after money
run after the fulfillment of your dream.

I started as assistant
and I got to be the director.

Nigga, I'm hungry!
I can throw my ass naked in the jungle ...

and the exit
with one's clothes in the ila,

with a fur hat
the leopard

and 4 kg fat
halite from other crow!

With all due respect, Puff.
Dreams do not pay the bills.

He's paying them.
I do not know what to say to you that in the ila,

but if I throw myself into the jungle

I'll make you dance nenorociÃ¾i.

Maybe in the hands of the be ...
one of the best.

How many years?
19 years.

Until the 21 years I will be millionaire.

We can change the world, Biggie Smalls.
Can we change the rules.

West Coast it has Snoop, Dre
and the Cube. We kill.

The East Coast still wait on someone
choice I belong.

Can be black or can of Brooklyn
made about blacks in Brooklyn.

You choose, streets or the studio.
Te bagi?

What are you, Big Mama?

What did you say?

Big Mama.

Great show.
How goes?

Every day I wonder how you do.
What is it?

The problem is that I care.
You know what I mean?

Yes, as you say, "Big Papa".

You filthy mouth.
And you want to do something about the this?

I think not.

Wait.

Want something to eat?

Shit! Yes! Yes!

Why do not you come over?

You seeing anyone?

It's too late to ask this.

I saw someone.

It is often thought about Mike Tyson.

You will not make anyone worse
ever.

I'll take care of you, okay?

Big Puff.

I sat here and we have all expected.

What are you doing?
Hi, B.I.G.

Andre said he wanted to be
one lion in the jungle.

What the hell are you talking?

B.I.G., I was fired.

And my contract?

I think I'll start.
I do not knew that you are oave bra.

Can you arrange some concerts
by facultÃ£Ã¾i.

That only until successful esc
to get something real.

B.I.G.? Dad died on the streets
when I was two years.

You have no future there.

Just because you're now at Earth
does not mean that you can not I back.

What does not kill you
makes you human.

I thought that contract and now
I have no what buy diapers.

Must take over.

Parc steady traffic.
It's a thought, and me.

Shit!

There is one.
Send a unit after him.

You have no where to run.

Do not make things.

Do you see my hands.
Come on, hands.

Show me your hands
and drop the gun.

When I was little, if you had
cuÃ¾it box and were considered a bad guy.

Now you know least 13 years and that it impui
traficanÃ¾ii on the street corner

that can take place.

What is the world choose

when no drug traficanÃ¾ii
may not be walking the streets at night?

Tell me, Chris, what's your first:
socks, clothes ... gun?

I have never seen that gun.

Then it should be yours.

One of you will be arrested
for carrying a gun.

I do not care which.

But in any case will not be delivered
both.

We put down a second.

We try to collect the door a.

A search to secure fingerprints.

You invent something then.
There will be too late.

You criminal, you will condemn
at least 5 or 6 years.

If you leave me guilty
I will give only 3 years in prison.

Absolutely not.
Fuck!

Not everybody gets
where did you get it.

When a miscreant like you go somewhere
and we get time with him.

And if you do not succeed esc?

Listen, I've learned
how to make the drug business.

Now I say to renunÃ¾i.

Want a contract? Search one!
But do not go back on the streets!

You can do something
and now I'll put your ass to safety.

So I do it.

So?

I put the osetele first
bastard.

Well.

Come on, clear it away.

What is B.I.G.? You are okay?

I want to leave this motherfucker,
my life is at stake, you know?

I have a fetita,
I feel that is stuck in the mud here.

Tell Puff
that they agree to my dream of watching.

Whatever he wants to do,
I agree.

But you must leave now.
I'll tell Puff.

I will take care of you.

Puff will come soon.

I understand what you do.
There are, however, a man.

Come here any time at night ...
She called Jane.

Are you gonna rupi
and your daughter?

You are too busy
to see her.

Not working.

And start to wonder
in the end what you do.

Everything is under control.

What kind of man in all of nature
and they say "Puffy"?

It's absolutely ridiculous.
Not even does not have a job.

Why not you?

Sorry, Ms. Wallace.

Please can you let me explain
with what has taken Chris.

Please ... I want to hear.

Yes, lady.

Your son has something special.

Sometimes this will mean working
hard, until the night

but I believe that efforts
will be rewarded.

If you see that and not take work
seriously, we will announce it first.

We understand to be my agent.

Okay then.

And if you want to feel responsible
believe me, so I will consider.

Yes, lady.

You can talk to Chris.
Yes, ma'am.

My doctor found a tumor in breast.

What?

I will work next week ...

Should be aggressively
if we want to and any chance.

"If" ... What does this mean?

I want to be honest with you, Chris.
No, mother.

No, listen.

You want to know ...
Christopher? Please.

I have so many ideas in my head
that I toss all night.

I can ...

I thought about my cousin, Wayne.
It's very expect.

I think you call it
help me.

I think I will like, B.I.G.

Do what you want.

B.I.G.? B.I.G.?
Want to talk about it?

About what?
What panic.

You said nothing about two days.

My mom has breast cancer.
I know how to cure?

No. I think not.

I was only 15 years when my mother
died of cancer.

How did you do?
I want to talk about.

B.I.G., look, I know that pass
through a difficult period ...

but you must be strong
for mom.

Must be near her,
can susÃ¾ii.

I will pray for your mother, B.I.G.

So I teÃ¾i knowledge?

Maybe some are with us.

What does not kill you makes you a man.
For the record label Bad Boy.

Puff?

I want to talk.

What is your mother?

Better, just a day school.

Puff,
thing with Bad Boy is good?

Let me show you something.

I took that to Clive Davis.

A face, Biggie Smalls.
Second front, Craig Mack.

B.I.G. Mack.

It B.I.G. Mack. You understand?
What can you say? Open it.

Welcome to Bad Boy.

It's tough.
I like it.

It will be my first single.

I want to hear.

Understand what I mean?

Trying to make him jump on the chairs.
O to be like soul music!

I think to laugh about it.

If you do this, one you can laugh
and you'll fill the money!

What next?
I'll make you dance like MC Hammer?

Leave them on those with life in the neighborhood
for face B.

If you do not have anything that
to be broadcast on the radio,

No one will hear of your album.

You'll be just a broke rapper.
Trust me.

Puff is right.
And many put money in the studio.

Ãƒ Âº tia looks like Rick James.

Please ...
Do what you want.

Come back in a few hours.
We will prepare something before then.

I need Pepsi
and still some grass.

And for some chicks.
Tell them that give a party.

And the weather was.
I'm back soon.

To hear once
thing.

To find the money.
Look at him.

Big Mama is looking for you on the phone.

Not now.

Okay, man.
I understood.

B.I.G., out of some lyrics?

I need inspiraÃ¾ie.

Get in the studio.
I wait Puff.

Come on, man, you wake up.
To make that piece.

Thing caught.

Puffy gave him pulse necessary.

As I say we,

a track that led to 100%
to 200%.

Some have said that reinforced
the funk in hip-hop.

I know just ...

what it's made of.

I am a man who tries to be successful.
How did you started singing?

In a Baptist Church choir.

Typical.

Dream to become an artist
and in the end I was offered the chance.

I wanted to make myself actriÃ¾Ã£.
No.

I wanted to say that

To hear some rhythms of old school.

Want to duel?

Hey, B.I.G.

What are you doing, brother?

Good show.
How are you?

All right, brother.
Good to see you.

You break it.
Want to see what can?

Pac, I have your autograph?

That you get minÃ¾i?

What?
People I will autograph

would like karate 14.

A least you came to me
and he said that is his hero.

But I said that Malcolm X
should be a hero,

or Dr. King.

That was Pac,
revoluÃ¾ionar a second,

then fucking tramp
a minute later.

If you ask ten people what's Pac
premiums are ten different answers.

But it was all in one place
and something more ...

And sometimes that was a joke.
Give me the money.

But what Pac said, the move to
moments are the beginning,

because when you get to the top
you can only lower.

Pac was right, night
at Quad studio changed everything.

What are you, Pac?

What?
Come up?

Yes, I work at level 12.
I'm going to B.I.G.

Yes.

B.I.G., I just saw down Pac.
Yes?

Yes.
Bring him here.

Well.

B.I.G. reserved all ten floor
for a record session.

Yes? As records go?

Come on, you know that-and do the job.
Ensure that work.

Said made some bucÃ£Ã¾i
all good, man.

With some chicks for you to move
I'm not in the side of anything.

Down, you bastard!

Get back into the elevator, man.

B.I.G., Pac is down and is robbed!
He threatened with a gun!

Stay here.
I want to come with you!

I like you here.

Shit!

He was attacked in the hallway.

Pac!

Stay here.
Wait!

Shut up and raises hands!

Somebody call a ambulanÃ¾Ã£.
Tupac, what happened?

Tupac not people who in the hell
to have confidence.

Stay away from me.

Which one of you he stretched trap?

I'm right here, motherfucker.
What?

For him, all people
were responsible.

Fuck you 'to everyone!

Including me.

<i> Following the fires drawn in
Quad Studios on Tupac Shakur's </ i></i>

<i> rapper and actor has appointed
manufacturer Sean "Puffy" Combs ...</ i></i>

What? No.
That's a lie.

B.I.G., calm down.
Should not see this now.

Can not believe it.

<i> music producer Sean "Puffy"
Combs and rapper Christopher Wallace ...</ i></i>

Shit! A call to him.
It's you who he impui the cat!

B.I.G., wait.

B.I.G., wait.

You just said man guilty
of rape.

You are not thinking clearly now.

Understand?
Give time to pass.

May take you EZE things.

Has no meaning.

This is ...

Tupac has done jail
chart for the rape.

I think you will be extinguished
and shit.

But in that event,
From Death Row Records ...

he had something else in mind.

And I want to say something.

Artists know that they want to remain
artists are, big stars ...

no need to go
in front of executive producers.

Video disks, dances ...

VeniÃ¾i to Death Row!

Come on, man.

We must raise
top stuff.

Will take place any confrontation
in the East Coast and West Coast?

You did impui close and Tupac?

Come on, get outta here.

When the singing of the choir ...

Go see who it is.

Sorry, we do not know what happens.

Where the hell is Faith?

I'm in the eli, bitch?

Come, I want to talk.

Open the door!
Leave me alone!

Yea and there.
Go!

Faith!
Clear it!

What was in your mind?
I thought.

I exit minÃ¾i of it, okay?

I just want to know truth.
The truth is that it makes Pac.

He wants to pull you down
once with him.

And you do it game B.I.G.

I know you got problems.

But I just signed
for 42 million dollars.

And you get five, B.I.G.
You give your foot.

Faith.

Open the door, I want to talk.

Open the door a.
Please, Faith.

You open the door?
Faith.

What happens?

Fuck you!

Not even not know who the hell are you.

You can go asculÃ¾i least?

Faith, listen to me.

It is over.

I'm sorry for everything.
I'm sorry for everything.

Why do not segment as a man
and ask me directly?

Okay, I wonder.

What happened between you and Pac?

I saw the House of Blues,
I did that picture ...

and that was it.

The end of the story you know.

Okay.
Maybe now you know you like ...

You are you and in Elat.
There is reason for praise, Faith,

but could have and ten women a day
if wanted.

Please do get ten,
even twenty. I do not care.

I wanted to call you a.

No.

Chris.

Do not laugh.

I laugh.
Faith ...

Damn.

What?
You are Notorious?

Yes.
A capeÃ¾i to what meriÃ¾i, nigga.

Who are you?
West Coast, you bastard.

How much are they?

44, as you said it.
I'm not 44, shit!

I'm 42, not 44!
I ...

Cease, bring your car.

I exit with all!

Come on, everybody out!

Make the crazy.

I have another much!
You do not work!

Yes! I have gre at extent it's shoes
and now no longer go anywhere!

Do not have time for such a thing.

You need to calm down, Puff.
Has a lot on my mind now.

I streseazÃ£ those from Death Row
the public?

B.I.G. not worried about that.
Not that, man.

Faith is pregnant.

How to get pregnant?
Park is despÃ£rÃ¾iserÃ£!

So many drama tear.
Do not go.

B.I.G., please don 't do that.
Do not you do that Ã¾ie!

I have always done
what you asked.

I just want some nenorociÃ¾i
shoe that will suit me.

And fight.
Yes.

Can I get my shoes
too seriously.

Measure 44?
Yes, I took seriously.

I know that I had not been easy.

Pac said many things
about us.

The press has done all it can
that this conflict between the East Coast ...

and West Coast to continue ...

I want to be last standing.

And I hope and you want to
this.

Look, I did get to the people.

Are not moved to,
but I must thank you to them.

Look at me.

He and I said to you
I'll change the world?

We can change the world
if we change and take us.

Come here, you bastard!

West Side, you bastard!

Now what are you doing toady?

Did you attracted into the trap!

What about now?

That's why I pulled a lu 'wife!

Did you attracted into the trap,
motherfucker!

Come on.

West Side, B.I.G.
I can see you.

Pac and I had
to put an end to crap.

I had to go somewhere
to solve this shit.

But the truth is
mersesem that far.

The media went crazy.

Had no business with hip-hop-ul,
but wanted to sell newspapers and magazines.

If not New York
does not mean anything.

West Side is the Law.

We have Big.
We have all.

We have Pac, we got Dre ...

Let us put music
on the East Coast.

No one to hear you something
clubs in the Bronx.

Anyway we have created
all this shit with rap music.

S East Coast is the pa na!

Maybe they think that
were the first,

but we took everything
than above.

Tupac speaks up
what really happens

the streets!

I know that B.I.G. He pointed into the trap,
Pac that I'll pull it!

This is a stupid!
He drew the race?

Biggie has arranged all
because it bears his ill blood Pac.

How to believe that Pac Biggie
I would do that?

To hell with the West Coast!
A to receive what worth!

I do not care who I Ã£ gangsters and people.

To hell with the East Coast ...
West Coast ...

I'm thinking about
fucking the East Coast.

I saw my mother's
television.

It is a powerful woman.

But no parent should not
and to bury their child.

I always say
I have time to adjust accounts.

Do not think that this had any connection
of arguing with you?

No.

Do not believe it.

Well, nobody is invincible,
son.

This must do
every minute to count.

I do not know when I fix your car,

but to get home in time
and with this piece.

Well. Just drive.

Take care!

And in a minute

I went back and
thought that through your head.

That would be better to die
but to do this shit.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Tell your prayer.

Oh, my God,

thank you.

What?
Yes.

I thought it was perfect.

We love you, Biggie!

My son, Christopher Wallace,
stories are told.

Some of them were funny,
others were sad.

Some were violent,

but people were listening to it.

I am sad that life he was persimmon
the age of 24 years.

But I find the thought of relieving
I became a man

and that he was ready to live.

When I looked out,
to all those faces,

something happened.

Someone from lot
started a radio

and I could hear my son's voice.
