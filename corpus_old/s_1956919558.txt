Wake up the Americans.

Hey.

We live in a twilight world.

We live in a twilight world.

And there are no
friends at dusk.

You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.

But I established contact...

Bring you in or kill you.

I have two minutes, make up your mind.

Where's the package?
Coat check.

Stay.

Grab his!

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

Who are you?

"No friends at dusk", huh?
You'll do. Get him to the rally point.

Swap clothes.
The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.

I've never seen encapsulation like this.
We don't know how old it is but it's the real deal.

Did you have an out?
Service tunnel to the sewer.

Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

Can you defuse that?

It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

Covering their tracks.

Taking out the audience?
They're just the cheap seats.

It's not our mission!
It's mine now.

Walk away.

You don't have to kill these people.

That wasn't one of us.
I'll take the help.

Go go go go go!

It's not the guy!

A man can be trained to hold out
for about eighteen hours.

So your colleagues will be clear by seven.

He didn't last eighteen minutes.
He didn't have anything to hide.

You're smuggling a nobody.

It's risky.

Or were out counting on this?

Death, CIA issue.

Spare yourself once they're clear.

Almost seven. Uh-oh.

It's running fast.

We have to put it back one hour.

Get it out!

Welcome to the afterlife.

You've been in a medically induced coma
while we got you out of Ukraine

and rebuilt your mouth.

Suicide pills were fake.

Why?

A test.
Test?

They pulled my teeth out.

Did my team get clear?

No. Probably Russians, we think.

Somebody talked.

Not you.

You chose to die instead
of giving up your colleagues.

We all believe we'd run into
the burning building.

But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

You do.

I resign.

You don't work for us. You're dead.

Your duty transcends national interests.
This is about survival.

Whose?

Everyone's.

There's a cold war, cold as ice.

To even know its true nature is to lose.

This is knowledge divided.

All I have for you... is a gesture,

in combination with a word. "Tenet".

Use it carefully.

It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones too.

That's all they've told you?

That test you passed?

Not everybody does.

With a hi-vis vest and a clipboard
you can get almost anywhere.

Almost.

An obscure tenet.

No small talk. Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.

I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

You're not here for "what",
you're here for "how".

"What" is your department.
And not my business.

Well, to do what I do, I need some
idea of the threat we face.

As I understand it, we're trying
to prevent World War Three.

Nuclear holocaust?

No.

Something worse.

Aim it and pull the trigger.

It's empty.
Aim it.

Check the magazine.

How?

One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

The other one's going backwards.

Can you tell which is which?

How about now? It's inverted.

Its entropy runs backwards.

So to our eyes, its movement is reversed.

We think it's a type of inverse radiation
triggered by nuclear fission.

You didn't make it?
No, we don't know how yet.

So where'd it come from?
Someone's manufacturing them in the future.

They're streaming back at us.

Try it.

You have to have dropped it.

How can it move before I touch it?
From your point of view, you caught it.

But from the bullet's point of view,
you dropped it.

But cause comes before effect.

No. That's just the way we see time.

Well, what about free will?

That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

Don't try to understand it.

Feel it.

Instinct.

Got it.

Why does it feel so strange?

You're not shooting the bullet.
You're catching it.



I've seen this type of ammunition before.
In the field?

I was almost hit.
Then you were exceedingly lucky.

An inverted bullet passing through your body
would be devastating. Not pretty.

These look like today's.

They might have been made today
and inverted years from now.

Where did you get them?
They came with the wall.

I was assigned it, like all
the material I'm studying here.

Do you have an analysis on the metals?

Sure. Why?

The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made. Look...

I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

A bullet may not seem like much,
but it's a simple machine.

Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

If they can invert that, we see no reason
they couldn't invert pretty much anything.

Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

An inverted weapon might be able
to affect our past as well.

Now that we know what to look for,
we're finding more and more inverted material.

Remnants of complex objects.

What do you think we're seeing?

The detritus of a coming war.

Yep?
We live in a twilight world.

No friends at dusk.
Thought you left the building.

Even the dead need allies.
Specifically?

I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjai Singh.

Singh? He never leaves his house,
and his house is... his house...

Yes it is. I'm looking right at it.
I'll see who's on deck.

Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

It seems you need an introduction
to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.

I'm Neil.
I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.

That's not possible.
Ten minutes, tops.

Time isn't the problem. It's...

getting out alive that's the problem.

Would you take a child hostage? A woman?

If I had to.
I'm not looking to make much noise here.

Yes?
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

What?

You never drink on the job.
You're well informed.

It pays to be in our profession.
Well, I prefer soda water.

No, you don't.

How's your parachuting?

I broke an ankle during basic training.

Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

It's bungee jumpable.
 I don't think "bungee jumpable" is a word.

It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.

Or into it, for that matter.

I know you're tired.
I am also very tired.

Stay back.

I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

I want to know who supplied it.

My name is Sanjay. And you are?

No chitchat?

There's no one at the other end.
No one who's gonna help you anyway.

Don't let it get cold.

Why should I know who supplied it?

Combination of metals is unique to India.
If it's from India, it's from you.

 Fine assumption.
Deduction.

Deduction then. Look, my friend...

guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

Or the man they send to make deals.
But I am the man people talk to.

I can't. I can't tell you.

You're an arms dealer, friend. This may be
the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.

To say anything about a client would
violate the tenets he lives by.

If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me. Everything.

Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please.

Cheers. Priya.

This is your operation.

A masculine front in a man's
world has its uses.

The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator.

The Russian oligarch.

You know him?
Not personally. Made his billions in gas.

Moved to London. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.

Very good.

Except the gas he made his
billions from was actually plutonium.

None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

When I sold him the rounds
they were perfectly ordinary.

So how did he get them inverted?

We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker,

between our time and the future.

He can communicate with the future?
We all do, don't we?

Emails, credit cards, texts.

Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

The question is, can the future speak back?

And I'm supposed to find out.

To get anywhere near Sator will take
a fresh-faced protagonist.

And you are fresh as a daisy.

Get close. Find out what he's receiving and how.

Is it safe to involve British Intelligence?
I have a contact who's out of Sator's reach.

You must have had a plan for getting out.

Not one I loved.

May I help you, sir?

I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

Presume away.

If you'll follow me.

Started without you. Hope you don't mind.

I'll catch up.

Same for me, please.
I'll send the waiter.

No, just pass on the order.

I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

Anglo-Russian. So I have to watch my step.

Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish, but...

they don't seem to care.
Tell me about him.

I assume you're familiar
with the Soviet-era secret cities.

Closed cities not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

Most of them have been opened up
and renamed as regular towns.

Not the one Sator grew up in.

Stalsk-12. In the '70s it had
a population of about 200,000.

Thought to be abandoned.
Abandoned?

Some kind of accident.
After which it was used for underground tests.

Two weeks ago, same date as The Kiev Opera siege,

we spotted a detonation in Northern Siberia.
Just where Stalsk-12 was.

Sator emerged from this black spot on the map,

with ambition, and enough money to buy
his way into the British establishment.

Through his wife.
Katherine Barton. Eldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.

She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction.

A happy marriage?
Practically estranged.

Well, how do I get to Sator?
Through her, of course.

You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

Hardly.

We have an ace in the hole.

You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag?

It's a fake by a Spaniard, named Arepo.

One of two we confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

What happened to the other one?

Turned up at Shipley's, authenticated
by Katherine Barton. Put on auction.

And who do you think bought it?
Her husband?

Does she know it's a forgery?
Well, it's hard to say.

Rumor has it that she
and Arepo were close.

Look, no offense.

But in this world where someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

Can I recommend a tailor?
I'll manage.

You British don't have a monopoly
on snobbery, you know.

Well, not a monopoly.
More of a controlling interest.

Can you box that up for me?

Certainly not.

Goodbye, Sir Michael.

How can I help, sir?

Sorry, I wasn't notified of any
appointments. Mr...?

Goya.

Mr. Goya?
No. I'm told you're the person to see about Goya.

That's extraordinary.

What's it worth?

Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.

Provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays.

But what does your heart tell you?

So where did you say you acquired this drawing?

Tomas Arepo.

I bought my Goya for cents on the dollar
from an irate Swiss banker.

I traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

when he told me who paid
top dollar for another one of his pictures.

Your husband.
Where's your bargain?

Your drawing's an obvious fake.
My drawing's a very good fake.

You know that better than anyone.
The information is the bargain.

The information that I helped
defraud my own husband.

He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

If you and I were to make an arrangement...
Arrangement.

You mean blackmail.
Don't be afraid of the word.

My husband isn't. I'm sorry
to tell you he got there first.

He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?

Why would he?
He paid nine million dollars for it.

Barely covered the cost
of the holiday he just forced us on.

Where'd you go, Mars?

Vietnam on our yacht. His yacht.

You've got the suit, the shoes, the watch.

I think you're a little out of your depth.

People who've amassed fortunes like your husband's

generally aren't okay with being
cheated out of any of it.

The drawing is his hold over me.

He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

He controls me.

My contact with my son. Everything.

Leaving would never have been easy,
but now it's impossible.

You can't fight.

Just beg.

In Vietnam I tried to love him again.

I thought if there was love there
he might give me my son back.

We sat, on that bloody boat, watching the sunsets,

imitating some earlier time in our lives.

He seemed happy, so I asked him.

And he made me an offer.

He'd let me go if I agreed never
to see my son again.

I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.

He called us, contrite.

Then, when we got back, I glimpsed some other
woman diving off the boat, and he'd vanished.

I've never felt such envy.
You don't seem the jealous type.

Of her freedom.

You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?

But you share a son.

That's my life now.

Did you know that the drawing was a fake?
No.

Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close. I failed.

Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal.
But I didn't betray my husband.

In retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.
And he let Arepo walk free.

If you'd actually met Arepo, as you claimed,

you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere.

We spoke on the phone.
He can't do that either.

Where's the drawing?
Why?

Give me an introduction.
I'll take the drawing out of the equation.

No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

I might just be your second chance.
I don't need redemption.

At betrayal.

Friends of your husband's?

You knew this was going to happen.
Don't worry. They won't kill you.

Andrei dislikes tangling
with local law enforcement on that level.

You must have not really liked the look of me.
The look was fine.

It's best to get to the nasty part before
I care one way or the other.

There's a number in your left coat pocket.
Don't call from home.

You won't be taking my call.

I might surprise you.

I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.

Can we get going?

Please.

He wants you to see.

And he gets what he wants.

Not always, apparently.

Anna says we're going to Pompeii and see lava.

We will. We'll go together. I can come too.

Told you I'd surprise you.

He's a cute kid.
He's everything.

Where's the drawing?

Oslo. At the airport.
The airport?

Do you know what a freeport is?

A storage facility for art that was acquired...
But not yet taxed.

We started a network.

Rotas, his construction company, built them,
I brought in the clients.

The facilities are tax havens.

The clients can view their
investments without importing them,

so they avoid paying tax.

So it's sort of like a transit lounge for art?

Art, antiquities, anything of value really.

Anything?
Anything legal.

But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system.

Opaque.

As I'm sure you are aware,
most freeports are just warehouses,

but here we ensure that you can enjoy...

Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

And this way to the vaults.

Guessing?
Guessing?

Well, we make trips there four, five times a year.

To view art?
And whatever it is he does.

Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei.
But the freeports are.

The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

Each vault a separate structure within the others.

Damage to one structure won't
compromise the others.

Some clients opt for biometric access.
Straight in...

Off the tarmac.

From the terminal?

From their private planes.
Of course.

Our logistics department ships

to and from any other freeport in the world
without customs inspection.

What are you hoping to find in there?

You really want to know?

I'm not sure.
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

Jesus, it's nuclear.

When you're on the tour,
pay attention to the fire precautions.

Documents are vulnerable to...
Fire, absolutely.

I was going to say, water damage
from the sprinkler systems.

We don't use sprinklers.

The facility is flooded with halide gas,
displacing all the air within seconds.

Can you show me?
Well if I did, we'd suffocate.

What about the staff?
Halide only fills the vaults,

they just have to get into either corridor,
and there is a ten second warning.

At least you give them ten seconds.

Well, sir, our clients use us...
because we have no priorities

above their property.

Blimey.

Vault doors are fireproof. Hydraulic closers,

simple key and electronic triggers.

Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown.

Why a lockdown?

The power switches to failsafe,
sealing the outer doors,

but the inner doors revert to factory settings.

And pickable locks. It's child's play really.

Child's play? You're inside airport security.

They have to worry about
climate control, not armed raids.

So how do we get enough firepower through
the perimeter to trigger their lockdown procedure?

Back wall of the freeport.
You've got something?

You're not gonna like it.

You want to crash a plane?

Well, not from the air, don't be so dramatic.

I want to run a jet off the taxiway,
and breach through the wall and start a fire.

Well, how big a plane?

Well... that part is a little dramatic.

This is Mahir. His team will work the plane.

There can't be passengers.
Norskfreight.

They use the hangar
on the west side of the freeport.

You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.
On the move?

What's the problem? They'll be fine.

Well, it seems bold.

"Bold" I'm fine with.
I thought you were gonna say "nuts".

And if you get caught?
We won't.

And if you do?

Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died, so...

a swift extradition and lost in the system.
It'll barely make the news.

That all depends on the size of your explosion.

Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play.

Gold bars?

Norskfreight ships treasury gold once a month.

Blow the back, drop it out on the runway.

No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

The space in the center of the pentagon
is too big. There's something there.

I can't figure it out, It's just not marked.

It's 45 seconds.
Ample.

Won't you be running?

Alright, it's your turn. Start packing.

Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector please.

Sir.

And sir.

Can I offer you perhaps a coffee? A water?
I'll take an espresso.

Sir?
No, thanks. Thanks.

Is everybody on this plane vegetarian?
Cause all I got here is vegetarian.

So that one looks like meat, but...

I think that looks vegetarian, I think they both
look vegetarian, I don't really know,

it's confusing, you know...

Okay.

This way, gentlemen.

Gentlemen, your assigned compartment.

Carry on. Not the radio.

Let's go.

Yoga.

Let's go! Now!

Go, go.

Alright, uh...

You said ten seconds, right?

There's someone in here with us.

Need a hand?
Actually, yes.

Don't touch them!
What the hell happened here?

It hasn't happened yet.

Don't kill him!

We need to know if we've been compromised.

Why are you here? Who are you?

How'd you know we'd be here?

We need to go.

What happened to the other guy?

I took care of him.

Well, I've seen too much. I'm still alive,
which must mean you've decided to trust me.

Or maybe I lost my edge?
Your edge is still intact.

There's a cold war.
Nuclear?

Temporal.

Time travel?
No.

Technology that can invert an object's entropy.

You mean reverse chronology,

like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a
positron is an electron moving backwards in time?

Sure, thats exactly what I mean.
I have a master's in physics.

Well, try and keep up.
I mean the implications of this are...

Beyond secret.
Then why'd you bring me in?

I thought we'd find a drawing
and couple boxes of bullets.

You were as surprised as I was.

I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.

I'll set you up as a go-between,
but remember, to you...

it's all about plutonium.
Or when we're done, they'll kill you.

Won't you have to do that anyway?

I rather it be my decision.

So would I... I think.

Your work?

What did you find in the vaults?

Two antagonists. One inverted.

We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

Both emerged at the same moment?
Yeah.

They were the same person.

Sator's built a turnstyle in that vault.
A turnstyle?

A machine... for inverting.

You told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

It hasn't, he's been given it by the future.
For what?

You have the best chance of finding out.

Have you met him?
I was close.

What if you have something he needs?
Such as?

Plutonium-241.

Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under
a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev.

He got the team. Not the 241.

Who did?
Ukrainian security services.

It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.

I'm just gonna take him out.
No, no, no, no. No, Sator has to stay alive.

He has to stay alive
until we know his part in things.

Leverage the situation
without losing control of the 241.

It's too dangerous.

A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

is nothing compared with
what could happen if you don't stop Sator.

From doing what?

We are being attacked by the future.

And Sator's helping. We have to find out how.

I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

You don't have to worry about it anymore.
You destroyed it?

I didn't think you'd want it back.
Does he know?

Not yet. So sit tight.
Sit tight?

Every day my son spends with that monster,
he thinks a little less of me.

It won't be long.
In the meantime, introduce me.

As what?

I'm a former First Secretary
from the American Embassy in Riyadh,

We met at a party last June.

We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June...

June 29th, 19:00 to 19:30.

Salmon was on the printed menu,
swapped for sea bass on the night.

Sator left early, that's when we met.
I came into Shipley's in London,

you ran into me here,
and want to show me your yacht.

He'll think we're having an affair.
And he'll want to meet me.

Or have you killed.
Let me worry about that.

Did I look worried?

Sleeps 70 with crew.
Two helicopters. Missile defenses.

Afraid of pirates?
Andrei lives playing one government off the other.

The day they turn, that's his refuge.

May I join you?
Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.

Then we'll take mine.

Max!

Who's the American?

He's a friend.
The man from Shipley's.

That you tried to have beaten up.

I ask again. Who is he?

We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

Good with fists for a diplomat.
Paranoia is your department, Andrei.

He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

Max?

He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

You just sent him off?
I promised him I'd go with him.

I explained you were busy.

With your friend.

Hey, easy, fella. Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.

Mr. Sator.
Don't bother.

Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet.

Uh, no.

Not yet.

How would you like to die?

Old.
You chose the wrong profession.

There's a walled garden up the road.
We're going to take you there, cut your throat.

Not across, in the middle, like a hole.

Then we take your balls and we
stuff them in the cut to block the windpipe.

Complex!

It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like

try to pull his own balls out of
his throat before he chokes.

Is this how you treat all your guests?
We're finished.

Do you like opera?

What?
Not here.

You sail?
I've messed around on boats.

Be on the dock at 08:00 ready to talk
more than mess around.

08:00.

Max missed too much school this year.
I'm taking him back to England.

School won't be okay with him missing so much.
Yes, they will.

Can I finish?

You want the trappings of a king.

We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games

with a wife who doesn't love you anymore.

You seem...

spirited today.

Do I?
Yes you do.

Were you worried it had been destroyed?

Rest assured, instict told me
to remove it from the vault.

I've always had instincts about the future.

That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

Sailing or diving?

Rising!

What do you know about opera?

In 2008,

a remote Russian missile station
was overwhelmed and held for a week.

When the station was retaken,

the 241 on one warhead
was three quarters of a kilo lighter.

The missing 241...

surfaced at the Opera House siege
in Kiev on the 14th.

Coming about!

What do you propose?

A partnership.
 I wouldn't partner with you.

You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

Someone in the arms trade with training.
Knows how to cover his tracks.

Not that shocking.
Or an intelligence agent.

Right!

Burn in hell, Andrei!

You can't drive a boat like this!
You can if you have to!

Why didn't you let him drown?
I need him.

To sell guns?
I'm not who you think I am.

That I know. He showed me the drawing.

I'm sorry. I had to get close to him.

I don't know what you think your husband does...

Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

He's so much more.
What then?

Andrei Sator holds all of our lives
in his hands, not just yours.

Mr. Sator wants to see you.
Okay.

Now.

He wants to see me without pants?

Trust me.
Save it. I'm not falling for it twice.

You have a better option?

Whatever it takes to get what you want.
Not a second thought for me or my son.

What do you think he's going to do to me now?

Try not to use it.

On anyone.

Enough.

See? Pulse of a man half my age.

Drink with me.

It seems I now owe you my life.

It's nothing.

My life is not nothing.

And I don't like to be in debt.

Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.

You think she released my harness?

It was my own mistake.

Then help me steal the 241.

I need resources, it's weapons-grade plutionium,
that means special handling,

containment facilities...
I know what it means.

You lecture me about radiation?

Andrei Sator,

digging plutonium from
the rubble of my city as a teenager.

Where?

Stalsk-12.

My home.

One part of a warhead exploded at ground level,
scattering the others.

They needed people to find the plutonium.

It became my first contract. Nobody else even bid.

They thought it was a death sentence.

But...

one man's probability of death...

is another man's possibility for a life.

I staked my claim in the new Russia.

Even now my company is the only one
to operate in the ruins.

The 241 is being transported
through Northern Europe,

on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.

Stay with us tonight. I insist.

What do you want?
We're going to talk about today.

No, we're not.
No?

We'll see.

Don't think for a second you can treat me
like you treat your other women.

And...

how do you imagine...

I treat these other women?

You think I force them into conversation?

You want to be quiet? Fine.
You can bite down on that.

Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?
It's all I have to offer you.

Well, that will have to do, then.
Why didn't you just let me go?

Because...

if I can't have you...

no one else can.

If you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.

You think I'll let him interfere?
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.

End of deal.

So you leave me alone.

Not now!

98. Not bad for such exertion.

He was at the window.

I was curious.

My property shouldn't concern you.

Who are you? How do you come by your
information about the opera?

You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

Hell, the CIA provides two-thirds
of the market for fissile material.

They're usually buying, not selling.

But we do live in a twilight world.

Is that Whitman? Pretty.

Next one, it's a bullet in the brain.

No balls in my throat?

There will be no time for such things...

in Tallinn.

You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

No.

I spring the material. You pay me off.

And your wife does the exchange.

I never involve her in my business.
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

Put him ashore.

How do I contact you?
You don't.

How do you advance me the funds?

Handle the plutonium better than that.

What did you find on the gold?
No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.

How?
Dead drops.

He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

then digs it up to collect
the inverted materials they send.

Seemingly instantanious. Where does he bury it?

Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.

What did the soil samples show?

Northern Europe, Asia. Radioactive.

Everything salvaged from Oslo's been shipped here.

Why am I here?
I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.

Light convoy through downtown.
What's the thinking?

Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.

It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.

You have a point.

Is the convoy monitored from the air?

Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
and in come the cavalry.

We need big guns. Guns that
make the point without being fired.

We need a fast car that doesn't look fast.
Four heavy vehicles. All different.

Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

Most of all, we have to set this up
with nothing in the record.

Nothing electronic, nothing paper.

I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

His ignorance is our only protection.

You see, Kat?

Some of my favorites.

Singed, but ah, salvageable, wouldn't you say?

It's not my area of expertise.
Ah, that's right,

you would never have
anything to do with such things.

But this is where our worlds collide.

What is this, Andrei?
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.

The filthy business...

that put those clothes on your back,
and our boy in his school.

That you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

The convoy's due downton in ten.

Time to go.
I'm not going anywhere with you.

Look at me!

And understand...

You don't negotiate with a tiger.

You admire a tiger until it turns on you,

and you feel

its true fucking nature!

Don't.

You stay right there.

Green, two minutes.

You're not going to kill me.
I already tried.

You pushed me off a boat,
you're not going to shoot me in cold blood.

My blood's not cold, Andrei.

No, but you're not angry enough.

Because anger scars over into despair.

I look in your eyes...

I see despair.

Vengeful bitch! Living off me...

thinking that you're better! Enough!

Tell me everything as it happens.

See you on the other side.

Yellow, 60 seconds.

60. Check.

Blue, 45 seconds.

Blue, 45, check.

Okay, Red. We're coming to you.

Three trucks in place.

Watch everything. Give me all the details.

Alright, all set?

In five...

four...

three...

two...

One.

Go, Yellow!

We've got a problem!
We need backup! Shit!

Radio's down.
Are they still moving?

Check the radio chatter.

I've seen samples of encapsulation
in every weapons class. This is not one of them.

That's what he's after.

I can't understand this.
You said you spoke Estonian.

It's not Estonian. It's backwards.

What the hell is that?

Go, go, go, go!

Don't give it to him.

This isn't plutonium.
It's worse than that, goddammit!

He's getting away.

He left her in the car!
Go after her! Go, go, go, go, go!

Pull up alongside.

Come on, come on. Closer!

Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

Hurry up!

Please!

Sit tight. Sit tight, I'm calling in the cavalry.

What cavalry?

If you're not telling the truth, she dies.

I don't know what you're talking about.
You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right?

Who told you that?
Tell me, now. Is it really in the BMW?

I don't know.
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

Leave her alone!
Tell him!

â€ŽI don't have time to negotiate.â€Ž

Listen to me.
Three.

I can help you.

Help me!
Two.

Don't!
One.

Next one's a bullet to the head.

No.
One.

Two, three.

Okay! Okay.

The car. The BMW, I left it in the BMW.
We're going to check this is real.

It's in the glove box!

Where did you leave it?

Car or fire truck, which one?

Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

I already told you.

I believe you.

You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy togeth...

Clear!

Wheeler, go check the other side.

You too!

Where did he go?
The past.

It's in the glove box!
We're going to check this is real.

Three, two, one.
Okay! Okay.

Next one's a bullet to the head.

No. No!
One.

Listen to me.
Two.

Three.

I can help you.
I don't have time to negotiate.

Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

Leave her alone!
Tell me, now. Is it really in the BMW?

I don't know.
You left it in the car, not the firetruck, right?

Who told you that?

If you're not telling the truth, she dies.
I don't know what you're talking about.

Medic!
Check in.

She's been shot?

Bring her back this side.

Was she shot with an inverted round?

This is Ives. He's one of us.

Us! Who are these guys?
Priya's, ours.

How did Sator know about the ambush?
It's posterity.

An ambush in the middle of the street
can't stay out of the record...

Bullshit! He knew every move we made!

Every one of them! Somebody talked! Who was it?

Was it you?
No. No.

At every stage, you've known too much.
I'm going to ask you again.

Did you talk?

Nobody talked. They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

A what?

A pincer movement. But not in space, in time.

Half his team moves forwards through the event,

he monitors them, and then attacks
at the end, moving backwards.

Knowing everything.
Except for where I stashed the plutonium.

Which isn't really plutonium, is it?
I told you it was what he was after.

And you just told him where it was.

I lied.

Jesus, you lied about it?

He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

Lying is standard operating procedure.

It spread too far.

Meaning what?
She's gonna die.

Standard operating procedure.

Can't, can't you help her,
can we, can you do something?

Can't you stabilize the inverse radiation
by inverting the patient?

It takes days.
Let's go!

We took control of this machine minutes ago,
before that it was Sator's.

How long is she gonna live on this side?
Three hours tops.

I'm taking her through. I'm not gonna
let her die. I'll take my chances.

There's no way of bringing you back.

We find another machine.
A week ago? Where?

Oslo.

That facility is inside an airport
security perimeter. It's impregnable.

It wasn't last week.

We're going in. You might as well help us.

This is a proving window.
As you approach the Turnstile,

if you don't see yourself in the proving window,
do not enter the machine.

Why not?

If you don't see yourself reverse-exit
the machine, then you ain't getting out.

Is that gonna work?
Yeah.

See for yourself. There's your answer. Let's go.

She's stabilizing slowly.
I'll clean and close, but the rest is time.

How long does she need?
Four, five days. Week for sure.

Neil, find a way to get us to Oslo.
I'm going back out there.

To do what?

To stop Sator from getting away with
whatever it is I just gave him.

You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait...

You're going out there for her.

He threatened to kill her in the past.
If he does, what happens to her here?

It's unknownable.

If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

What do you believe?
What's happened's happened.

We need to save her here and now.

If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

Don't let them take her back through there.

Okay?
You can't stay here.

We don't have a lot of time.

So why don't you find us a nice,
cozy shipping container

that's just come off a ship from Oslo.

This is cowboy shit. You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into if you go through that door.

Well, I'm going. So any tips would be welcome.

Wheeler, brief him.

You'll need your own air.

Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

Number-one rule, don't come
into contact with your forward self.

That's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.

We don't have time.

Well, if your particles come into contactâ€¦
What?

Annihilation.
That would be bad, right?

When you exit the airlock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

Things will feel strange.

When you run, the wind will be at your back.

If you encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

as the transfer of
heat is reversed.

Gravity will feel normal, but you're
reversed for the world around you.

You may experience distortions in your vision
and hearing, this is normal.

Can I drive a car?
Cowboy shit.

I can't vouch for the handling.
Friction and wind resistance are reversed.

You are inverted. The world is not.

Was there a transponder on the case?
We've tossed that case.

I'm moving backwards. It's the ball
I have to follow. Give me the reader.

Okay.

You ready?

The material's not in the case.

Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.

He was lying.

It wasn't in the BMW.
So where is it?

I saw the hand-off.
You made me shoot her for nothing.

You did get my pulse above 130.
No one's done that before.

Not even my wife.

You left Ives and his team a hell of a clean-up.

Heat transfer was reversed.

You might be the first case of hypothermia
from a gasoline explosion in history.

At this point nothing surprises.

We're headed back to Oslo?
In a Rotas shipping container.

He's got the material, Neil.

I handed it to him on a plate.

I warned you.
What's happened's happened. I get it now.

But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

That's not fair.
You were a part of this before we met.

Were you working for Priya?
No.

Who recruited you, Neil?

It can't possibly do any good to know that right now.

When this is over, if we're still standing,
and you still care...

then you can hear my life story, okay?

I'm sorry I involved you.
You need to tell me what's going on.

Apparently Neil here knows more about
it than I do. Good luck, pal.

By telling Kat anything, we're compromising
her in Priya's eyes.

In Priya's eyes she's already compromised.
She has the right to know why she might die.

Am I going to die?
Not if we have something to say about it.

And we do.

Who are you?

Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

The material's not in the case.

Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.

Are you injured?

What's the algorithm, Neil?

The 241 is one section of it. One out of nine.

It's a formula, rendered into physical form
so it can't be copied or communicated.

It's a black box with one function.

Which is?

Inversion. But not objects or people.

The world around us.

I don't understand.

As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

But because the environment's
entropy flows in our direction...

we dominate. They're always swimming upstream.
It's what saved your life.

Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

Pissing in the wind.

And the algorithm can change
the direction of that wind.

It can invert the entropy of the world.

And if that happens?

End of play.

"End of play." Can you be a little more precise?

Everyone and everything
that's ever lived

destroyed instantly. Precise enough?

Including my son.

The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal.

On a truck.

Shouldn't be long now.

I've been thinking. We're their ancestors.

If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?

Which brings us to the grandfather paradox.
The what?

If you went back in time
and killed your own grandfather,

how could you have been born
to commit the act?

What's the answer?
There's no answer. It's a paradox.

But in the future, those in power
clearly believe that you can

kick Grandpa down the stairs,
gouge his eyes out

and and slit his throat without consequence.

Could they be right?

Doesn't matter. They believe it.

So they're willing to destroy us.

Can I go back to sleep now?

No, I thought of something else.
Great.

This reversing the flow of time,

doesn't us being here now mean it never happens?

That we stop them?

Optimistically, I'd say that's right.

Pessimistically?

In a parallel-worlds theory we can't
know the relationship between

consciousness and multiple realities.
Does your head hurt yet?

Yes.

Try sleep.

Shit.

They didn't take us inside.

What do we do?

We use the breach.
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.

Is she healed enough?

I don't know. I've never done this before.

The fire crew's there.

We take Kat through the breach,

I take care of Sator's men and secure the vault.

Then you bring her in.

How's the arm?
Not good.

We move as soon as we hear the engines.

Hold on.
What?

You're bleeding. Let me look at you.

Ready?

Wait here. I'm going in.

Come on!

Go, go, go!

You knew it was me coming out
of that vault. Why didn't you say?

That's a lot of explaining when someone's
about to put a bullet in their own brain.

But afterwards?
With things the same, I knew you'd be okay.

What's happened's happened. If told you
and you acted differently, who knows?

The policy is to suppress.

Whose policy?

Ours, my friend.

We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

Kat?

I'm here.

There'll be quite a scar, but you'll be okay.

You did it.

He did what?

Andrei has the algorithm.

You don't know where he is.

Or when.

Get Priya here to Oslo.
Why?

If I don't do something,
in two days she tells me about the 241.

Nothing can change that.

We'll see.

Just get her here.

Hello, Priya.

What's going on? Where's Neil?

Nursing Katherine Barton.
Who almost died because of you.

What did I do?
It's what you're going to do.

In two days you're gonna have me
dangle plutonium-241

in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

Now, I wanna know why.

You let Sator get hold of 241?

No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm.

So tell me about it, Priya.

It's... It's unique.

The scientist who built it took her own life,
so she couldn't be forced to make another.

A scientist in the future.
Generations from now.

Why did she have to kill herself?
You're familiar with the Manhattan project?

As they approached the first atomic test,
Oppenheimer became concerned

that the detonation might produce
a chain reaction engulfing the world.

They went ahead anyway and got lucky.

Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.

She devises a method for inverting the world.

But becomes convinced that by destroying us,
they're destroying themselves.

The grandfather paradox.

But unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels.

Splitting the algorithm into nine sections
and hiding them the best place she can think of.

The past. Here. Now.

There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs.

Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials
in the history of the world.

The best hiding place possible.

Nuclear containment facilities.

Sator's lifelong mission,
financed and guided by the future,

has been to find and reassamble the algorithm.

Why did the choose him?

Because he was at the right place
at the right time.

The collapse of the Soviet Union.

The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.

How many sections does he have?

After the 241, all nine.

Jesus Christ.

And that's why you're going
to do things differently this time.

To change things?
So Katherine won't get hurt?

So Sator won't get the algorithm.

If that universe can exist...

we don't live in it.

Let's try.

You're going to warn me.
No, I'm not.

Ignorance is our ammunition.
Come on.

If you had known what the algorithm was,

would you have let it fall into Sator's hands?

You want Sator to get
the last section.

That is the only way
he'll bring together the other eight.

I was supposed to steal it... then lose it?

Mission accomplished.

You used me.

As you used Katherine.

Standard operating procedure.

You've done your part.

My part?

I'm the protagonist of this operation.

You... are a protagonist.

Did you think you were the only one
capable of saving the world?

No.

But I am. Because I haven't told you where
he's assembling the algorithm or when.

You're about to.

No. I'm not. So deal us in.

Us?

Why would you want to involve her again?

Because she can get close to him.
Does he still trust her?

He thinks she's dead. But he used to.

You have started looking
at the world in a new way.

And now it's your turn.

Assuming she makes it out alive,
whether or not you feel she knows too much...

I can't.
If you don't have the authority,

then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.

I need your word

that she and her son will be safe, Priya.

What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

They'll be safe.

There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim.

Get yourselves up there.

Ives has a team ready to invert.

You have a turnstile.

The exact technology we're trying to suppress.

Fighting fire with fire is a treacherous business.

But there are some people in the future

who want to continue
the algorithm's journey into the past.

You see, Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

It will be founded in the future.

I can't get over the birds.

How are you feeling?

Tell me you're going to kill him.

I can't.
Why not?

I think you've probably killed a lot of people.

Not with a dead man's switch.

The fitness tracker he wears.

He's obsessive about his health.
It'll be linked to a switch.

Probably a simple email burst that
reveals the location of the dead drop.

Set to fire if his heart stops.

His death activates the algorithm.

He dies, the world ends.

No one dares kill him.

No, you've missed the point.

He's intending to end his life.

Why?

He's dying.

Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

And he's taking the world with him.

If he can't have her, no one can.

He gets to choose the time and place
for the end of the world.

What moment? What does he choose?

You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

Vietnam.

You said he vanished. What day?

Well, I went ashore with Max and he flew off.
But I don't know what day it was.

It was the 14th, ten days ago.
He was in Ukraine.

At the Kiev Opera siege.
How do you know about that?

The point is he wasn't on his yacht,
so that's his window.

To go back to that golden moment
and have it be his last.

Everyone's last.

We have to lift the algorithm from
the dead drop without Sator knowing.

If he believes it's there, he kills himself.

And not the rest of us.

Where's the dead drop?

Knowledge divided, my friend.

You're not going to tell me?

Ignorance is our ammunition.

But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.
Why?

You have to stop him killing himself until we
know the algorithm is out of the dead drop.

But if I'm caught, then my son sees.

I don't want those moments to be full
of anguish, if they're going to be his last.

They're not.

It's time. We're working our way back to the 14th,

but without knowing where the dead drop is,

there's only so much I can do to prepare.

You know what a hypocenter is?

It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.

Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

The dead drop is at
the bottom of the hypocenter.

That explosion seals up the algorithm.

Well then we better pull it out of that hole
before the bomb goes off, eh?

Next.

Where's Neil?

He must have gone through already.
I didn't get to say goodbye.

This is goodbye, isn't it?

I'd like to say that
you don't have to do this, Kat.

Worst thing Andrei did to me
was that offer he'd made me.

Let me go if I agreed never
to see my son again.

I shouted and... swore.

But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.

I considered it.

I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

or because he knows that about me.

A chance to help save my child,
you can't know what that means to a mother.

No.
You've killed people you've hated before.

It's not usually personal.

Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

It always counts, Kat.

You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop.

If we don't lift that algorithm,
and he kills himself,

he takes us all with him.

You just keep up your end, okay?

Today's the 14th.

Offshore of Siberia. Time for us to go.

You keep going back another day,
give you some time time to get back into Vietnam.

Who gets me on the yacht?
I've got somebody good lined up.

When it's over, and you're raising
your boy, carry this.

There may be a time and
place you feel threatened.

Hit "talk", state your
location, hang up.

Who gets the message?

Posterity.

Stalsk-12.

Hidden from the world,
it's a city where anything can happen.

And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

We're Red, team moving forward.

In order to distinguish the teams,
you'll wear these.

Our friends over there, Blue team,
led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.

Why don't they let us see them?
Maybe we won't like what happened.

One hour from now, they had this briefing.

Then were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter

as close in time to the
detonation as possible.

Their objectives were clearance and clarification.

This briefing has the benefit of their experience.

Both teams have countdown watches.

Our counts down from ten from landing,
to zero to the explosion.

Blue team is reversed.

If you are not at the LZ at zero,
you are not leaving.

Do you understand?

We drop in, clear LZs for Blue team evacuation.

Make our way into the city proper.

These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned there is a turnstile.

Expect a bitemporal response.

They'll have inverse ordinance?
Inverse, conventional,

forward antagonists, inverted antagonists.
They have it all.

On the other side of the city, the ground
rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.

A splinter unit will take
this tunnel from the city

to the floor of the hypocenter.

Blue team located an entrance here.

The bomb is in this rock.

High above, to trigger a collapse,
sealing the cavern.

How do we defuse the bomb up there?

We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.

Our job is to fail to defuse that bomb,

while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

Which is...?
Need-to-know, and you don't.

Any other stupid questions?

Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.

I wanted to be on the first wave.
There is no first wave.

Red team and Blue team
operate simultaneously.

Look, don't get on the chopper
if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.

Now, you want to be on team
that lifts the contents of the capsule?

Absolutely.

Yeah, that's us.

We're the splinter unit.
Just us?

No one who knows the contents
of that capsule can leave the field.

I thought we'd manage ourselves.

It's 40 feet from the private deck
to the water. Can you jump it?

I can dive it.

Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.

30 seconds!

Move!

We're coming in on the shock wave.
Hang on, people!

On your feet!

Ma'am, we thought you'd gone ashore.

I snuck back to surprise Andrei.

The boss left...

Have Mr. Sator find me here.

And don't tell the others. I'll get the mess.

Mines!
Mines!

They told me you'd gone ashore.

They told me you'd flown off.

I came back to see you and Max.

Max is on shore with Anna.

We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

I was joking. It was a stupid joke.

You think I'm a terrible mother.

We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

I want things to be better, Andrei.

Take cover!

Get me a goddamn AT4!
Take him out! Now!

Let's go! Move, move, move!
Let's go! Move, move, move!

Wheeler!

Cover!
Come on!

Ives!

Splinter unit here!

You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset.

I'll get Max brought back,
we should share the moment with him.

I'll make you a drink.

Bring my son back to the boat.

We're running out of time, let's go!
If they see us, it's all for nothing.

We need a distraction.
Don't worry about that.

On my mark!

RPG! Take the base!

That building, on my mark!

Three! Two!

One! Fire!

Fire!

Move, move!

We're committed now. Come on.

What's that?

I borrowed it from the CIA.

What is it?

The way the world ends.

Not with a bang, but a whimper.

I don't understand.

When I take this, it's all over.

Then don't take it yet.

Why not?

Because we have the sunset coming,

and a little vodka left.

And Max will be here soon.

They said they thought it was you,
not Anna, ashore with Max.

So long as you can tell the difference...

A moment's business, my love.

Mahir, do you copy? Not clear.
I repeat: Not clear!

Copy that.

I repeat: Not clear!

Neil!

Neil!

Go!

We don't have anything big enough to blow this.

Try him. See if he's got a grenade.

Anything?
No, nothing.

You try having a look. Can you pick it?

I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock.

How do you like where
my journey began and yours ends?

A little radioactive for my taste.

My fate was always bound up with radiation.

We'd work where no one else would.

I made a bargain with the devil.

Money for time. We sold our futures.

And now you're about to make the same mistake,
but for the entire world.

It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I got.

What was yours?

You fight for a cause you barely understand,

with people you trust so little
you've told them nothing.

When I die, the world dies with me.

And your knowledge dies with you,

buried in a tomb,
like an anonymous Egyptian builder

sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.

Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.

What's more fanatical than trying
to destroy the world?

I'm not. I'm creating a new one.

Somewhere, sometime, a man
in a crystaline tower throws a switch

and armageddon is both
triggered and avoided.

Now time itself switches direction.

The same sunshine we basked in

will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.

How can they want to kill us?

Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

Don't you see? They have
no choice but to turn back.

We're responsible.

Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?

Yes.

Each generation looks out for its own survival.

That's exactly what they're doing.

But not you. You're a traitor.

Bringing death to all because
you have no life of your own left.

When I'm done, life continues.

Not your son's.

My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

You think God will forgive me?

Wait!

Wait!

Cover me!

Go! Go! Go!

You don't believe in God, or a future,
or anything outside of your own experience.

The rest is belief,

and I don't have it.

Without it you're not human. You're just a madman.

Or a God, of sorts.

Like I said.

Don't do it! Jesus!

Our time is up.

I'll give your love to my wife.

You're forgetting, I haven't met her yet.

That's right. After you meet her, she dies.

I'll just give her my love instead.

Don't do it!

Volkov.

Shoot him in the head.

Enough business, my love.

You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

But it sounds terribly important.

Where are you going?
Aren't you hot?

What are you doing now?
Oh, I spilled sunscreen.

So what?
It's slippery.

Just come here.

Turn over. You'll like it.

I can't do this.

I can't let you think you've won.
Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

You're dying alone, Andrei.

Come on, come on!
Tunne's sealed. The gate is closed.

Mahir, do you copy?

Yeah.

Hold! I repeat, hold!

Look into my eyes.

Which do you see?

Despair...

or anger?

I'm not the woman who can find love for you
even though you scarred her on the inside.

I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

You!

Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.

She jumped the gun. She killed him.

Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

Ah, screw it.

Kat, you jumped the gun!

I couldn't do it! I couldn't let
him die thinking he'd won.

I knew you'd find a way.

Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right?

Yeah, we found a way. Be safe.

I thought you were inverted.

I changed gears halfway.

Looked like you needed help here.

Here? We needed help down there.

How'd you get that lock open?

Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?

I'll get them on the next pass.

Right, Ives?
Once I've caught my breath.

No one who's seen it leaves the field.

Alright.

We hide it.

We end our lives.

It's the only way to be sure.

As to when...

Maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.

You're not going to kill us?

If I ever find you, I will.

You won't look too hard?

Yes, I will.

You're not going to go back
to London to check on Kat, are you?

No. It's far too dangerous.

Even from afar?

Even from afar.

Ives!

Wait.

You're really going back in?

I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.

See? That's me in there, again.

Weaving another pass
in the fabric of this mission.

Neil, wait!

We just saved the world.

Can't leave anything to chance.

But can we change things if we do it differently?

What's happened happened.

Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

It's not an excuse to do nothing.

Fate?
Call it what you want.

What do you call it?

Reality.

Now, let me go.

Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

Haven't you guessed by now?

You did.

Only not when you thought.

You have a future in the past.

Years ago for me. Years from now for you.

You've known me for years?

For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

But for me, It's just the beginning.

We get up to some stuff.

You're gonna love it. You'll see.

This whole operation
is a temporal pincer.

Whose?

Yours! You're only halfway there.

I'll see you at the beginning, friend.

We're the people saving the world
from what might have been.

The world will never know what could've happened.

And even if they did, they wouldn't care.

Because no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.

Only the one that did.

Do it before the boy comes out.

That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

And I told you then what it would be worth.

Here. Today.

How did you know?

Cannon Place, 15:00. Probably nothing, I...

Posterity.

Cannon Place, 15:00. Probably nothing, I...

I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

I had to tie up the loose ends.
That was never your job.

Then whose was it?
Mine.

I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

I'm the protagonist.

Then you'd better tie up those loose ends.

Mission accomplished.

It's the bomb that didn't go off.

The danger no one knew was real.

That's the bomb with the real power
to change the world.

Corrected based on the script. Fuck Nolan for
making people see this in theaters during a pandemic.
