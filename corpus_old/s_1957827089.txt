[pensive instrumental music playing]

Mother has a surprise for you
waiting up ahead.

A surprise?

A birthday surprise.

Norma Jeane. Look.

That man is your father.

My father?

He's my father?


His name is a beautiful name.

And an important name.

But it's a name I can't utter.

No!

You mustn't touch with sticky fingers.

So no one knows.

And no one must know,
even that you've seen this.

There are complications
in both our lives, you see?

When you were born,
your father was far away.

He's at a great distance, even now,
and I worry for his safety.

But in our hearts, we're wed.

We're husband and wife.

Though we scorn convention
and will not acquiesce to it.

But where is he?

[fly buzzing]

[telephone ringing]

Mmm. My hands are shaking.

Is this room vibrating?

In California, youâ€¦ can't tell
what's "real" and what's "just yourself."

[ringing continues]
[mother sighs]


[liquid pouring]
[mother chuckles]

So you don't drool on my cover.

[chuckles softly]

Do you remember, Norma Jeane,
who used to sleep here?

In this drawer? Do you remember?

[Norma Jeane groans]

You! [chuckles]

You, Norma Jeane!
You slept right in this very drawer.

We were so poor,
this drawer was your crib.

But it was good enough for us, wasn't it?

["FÃ¼r Elise" playing slowly on piano]


And one day,
I will return to Los Angeles to claim you.


Norma Jeane, honey. Wake up!

Wake up!

Come on. Up, up! Let's go!

[Norma Jeane] I'm tired.
[mother] Come with me.

Okay.

[door thuds]

[fire crackling]

[siren wailing]

[indistinct shouting]

[car starts]

[horns honking]

[car horn honks]

Stop squirming like
a little snake needing to pee.

Mother? What if the house burns down?
I forgot my tiger.


[car horn honks]
[man] Go back!

[dramatic music playing]


Oh God, I can't see a fucking thing.

[indistinct shouting]


Hey!

What the hell are you doing?


We've been invited to a private residence
at the top of Laurel Canyon.

The owner has a fireproof mansion.
My daughter and I will be safe there.

I can't say this man's name, officer,
but it's a name you all know.

He's a titan in the industry.

This little girl is his daughter.

This is a city of sand,
nothing will long endure,

but we are going.

Ma'am, go home.

Put your little girl to bed, okay?
It's late.

Actually, officer,
I'd like to see hell close-up.

A preview.

Ma'am, you need to turn around.

I can give you an escort
if you need one, but this is an order.

If you don't turn around,
I'll have to put you under arrest.

Under arrest for driving my car?

I'm sorry, officer.
Please don't arrest me.


Lady, look, go home, okay?

You're drunk, you're doped up,
and no one's got time for this tonight.

You're saying things
to get you into trouble.

[chuckles softly]


[car starts]

[mother grunts]

[breathing heavily]

[gear shifts]

[mother grunts]

Mother? Was he here?

My father? All this time?

Why didn't he come to see us?

[sobs softly]

What? What?

[Norma Jeane grunts, cries]
[mother yelling]


[mother sniffles and sobs]

[Norma Jeane] It's too hot.

Norma Jeane, get in the bath.

Be a good girl and get in the bath.

[inhales sharply]

[Norma Jeane] It's too hot.
Get in the bath!

[both sobbing]

Good girl. Good girl. Okay.

<i>and wished to spare her grief.</i>

<i>Because the child
was her own secret self, exposed.</i>

[mother shouting distortedly]

<i>of the child had wished it not to be born.</i>

[mother exclaims]

<i>scattering bills across the bed.</i>

<i>Because he told her
he had never loved her.</i>

<i>She had misunderstood.</i>

<i>Because before the pregnancy,
he had loved her.</i>

<i>And after, he had not.</i>

<i>Because he would have married her.
She was certain.</i>

[mother sobbing]


<i>could love a child so accursed.</i>

It's because of you!

You're the reason he went away!
He didn't want you!

[fire blazing]
[mother screams]

[objects crashing]

Help! Help us!

[doorbell ringing]
Help! Help us!

Help, my mother's sick!

Norma Jeane?
[Norma Jeane] Help my mother.

Clive, bring her in. Cover her.

Come here.

Come here, Norma Jeane.

There's something wrong with your mother?
She needs help.

She needs help?
[objects crashing]

[door shuts]

You come inside with me, Norma Jeane.

You wait right here. Okay?
[piano playing erratically]

You just stay with me.

You're okay. You're okay now.

You're safe, Norma Jeane.


<i>Your mama's well enough
to see you now, Norma Jeane.</i>

Your mama's been askin' for you.

The doctors say she's well enough
for you to visit her.

Shall we go?

Where is she?

She's in the hospital in Norwalk.

Shâ€¦ she's better now?

Well, she's well enough
for you to visit with her.

Uncle Clive is gonna take us in the car.

And I'm gonna put a few things
in a suitcase for you.

You don't have to do anything.

Okay.

[breathing shakily]

[car thuds]

[car stops]

[car door closes]

Please forgive me, Norma Jeane.

There's no other place for you right now.

Your mother is sick.

The doctors say that she is very sick.

She tried to hurt you.

She can't be a mother to you just now.

I can't be a mother to you just now.


I have a mother, and I have a father.

I'm not an orphan.

My father is coming home soon.
He promised.

Come on. Be a good girl. Be a good girl.

[Norma Jeane sobs] No!


[Norma Jeane] No! I'm not an orphan!
Stop it! Come on!

Come on! Please be a good girl.

[Norma Jeane] I am not an orphan!

the suitcases, Clive, damn you!

[Norma Jeane] My father
is coming back soon! He promised!


Stop crying! Stop!

â™ª <i>Every baby needs a da-da-daddy â™ª</i>

Then a half will do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Every baby needs a da-da-daddy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Could my da-daddy be you? â™ª</i>


It's a circle of light and attention.

You enclose yourself in the circle.

You carry it with you wherever you go.

You're going to imagine
that next to your own real body,

is the imaginary body of your character,

whom you've created with your mind.

â™ª <i>Every baby needs a da-da-daddy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With silver in his hairâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Daddy, I couldn't imagine what to wear.

You look fine.

Are you sure?


Just don't be late
for your appointment at 5:00.

As if I would be late. My God.

Don't you see, Norma Jeane?

The future is in the palm of your hand.

[Norma Jeane] <i>Marilyn Monroe for Mr. Z?</i>

<i>"Imagine, to know every night</i>

<i>that differing hundreds of people
love you."</i>

<i>"They want you."</i>

"You belong."

"Just that alone is worth anything."

[Mr. Z panting]

"You carry it with you wherever you go."

"The circle of light is yours."

â™ª <i>Every baby needs a da-da-daddy</i>
<i>In case she runs aground â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Every baby needs a da-da-daddy â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>To keep her safe and sound â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Yes, we feel just like Red Riding Hood â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>'Cause the wolves are awful hungryâ€¦ â™ª</i>


I don't understand.

If your name is Marilyn Monroe.

Yes, that's me.


<i>Do you see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.</i>

<i>Now go and do yourself some good.</i>

<i>Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?</i>

<i>'Cause that's what they are.
Now go and make him happy.</i>

â™ª <i>Oh, every baby needs a da-da-daddy â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Could my da-daddy be you? â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Could my da-daddy be you? â™ª</i>

[Norma Jeane screaming]

<i>Come back, Norma Jeane.</i>

<i>Come back here, Norma Jeane.</i>

[screaming continues]

Hey. It's okay.


[breathing heavily]

It's okay.

[playwright] It's all right, Norma Jeane.
[sighs]



What were you thinking of?

I wasn't thinking.

[chuckles softly]

Um, maybeâ€¦

[sighs, sniffles]

â€¦I was remembering?

[bell buzzes]

[machine beeps]
[bell rings]


Iâ€¦ I read the script, the whole script.

It's, umâ€¦
such a strange, disturbing story.

This mentally unbalanced woman
almost killing a little girl.

Like a novel by Dostoyevsky,
where you feel sympathy for the criminal

and don't wish to see her punished.

have you, honey?


[man coughs]
[Norma Jeane clears throat]

let's, uhâ€¦ let's begin.

Miss Monroe?

[breath trembling]

You go back now. Go back.


No. She doesn't belong to me.

This isn't your room.
You go back in there and go to sleep.


If you don't pay
any attention to them, they stop.

"I think I'd better leave
before twins pop out of the closet."

But you haven't any reason to leave now.

"Sure, I have. I want to."

I'll go with you.

Let's go dancing.
[man] "What's the matter with you?"

"You're supposed
to be here with that kid."

Then stay.

She won't bother you anymore.


"I can't figure you out."

I'll be any way you want me to be.


Becauseâ€¦

I belong with you, Philip.

I didn't think you were ever coming back.

"I'm Jed, Nell."

"I'm not the man you think I am."

"Remember?"

"Remember Philip?"

Yes.


"Think."

"What did he look like?"

[Norma Jeane gasps] <i>He hadâ€¦</i>

<i>Brown eyes.</i>

<i>Shiny black hair.</i>

"I'm not Philip. I'm Jed, Nell."

"I'm Jed."

People's namesâ€¦

You're not him.

You never were.

Thank you, Miss Monroe.



Please. [exhales]

Can I try again?

Ohâ€¦

Iâ€¦ [exhales] I know I could be Nell.

I think I am Nell.

She's a sleepwalker.

She doesn't see him.
She sees her dead fiancÃ©.

She's trapped in delusion.

But where does dreaming end
and madness begin?

Anyway, isn't all love based on delusion?

[continues indistinctly]

I really wantedâ€¦
Thank you, John. Thank you, gentlemen.


We'll hear from you.


<i>Like, um,</i>

watching a mental patient, maybe.

Not acting. No technique.

People like that, you can see
why they're drawn to acting.

Because the actor in her role
always knows who she is.

What do you think, boss?

[director coughing]

Sweet Jesus.

Look at the ass on that little girl.

[Norma Jeane] <i>Are you sure a visit</i>
<i>with her won't be too upsetting?</i>

or to you, Miss Baker?

I haven't seen my mother in ten years.

[patients shouting]

Those are some
of our more troubled patients.

Here we are.

Oh, Mother.


Mother?

Mother, it's me. It's me, Norma Jeane.

[sniffles, exhales tearfully]

Mother, it's so nice here.

Isn't it nice here?

Are you warmer now?

Oh, this shawl, it's so pretty on you.

It's been so exciting this past year.

So wonderful. Like a fairy tale.

Sometimes, I can't believe it.

I'm under contract at the studio.

Where you used to work.

I can make a living
just being photographed.

I guess there isn't
any Norma Jeane, is there?

Mother?

My father was under contract
to the studio, you said.

Around 1925?

I've been sneaking around there
trying to find his picture in the files...


They said my daughter was coming.

I don't know you. Who are you?



Do it!

[indistinct chatter]


Hey.

Hey, what's wrong? You okay?

Dee-Dee, it's okay. I have it.
We're fine, thank you.

[Norma Jeane cries]
[man] Oh, dear.

Hey, that's all right.
Everything is okay. Thank you.

Give us a second.

[breathing heavily]

<i>a rising new Hollywood talent</i>

<i>proves herself a strong dynamic presence
in this darkly disturbing thriller.</i>

<i>Also starring Richard Widmark.</i>

<i>Her portrayal
of a mentally unbalanced young babysitter</i>

<i>is so chillingly convincing...</i>

Mr. Shinn, at the premiere,
I shut my eyes a lot.

I couldn't believe that girl was me.

But everyone in the audience
would think it <i>was</i> me, Nell.

And later at the party, Marilyn.

[Shinn over telephone]
<i>Are you on painkillers?</i>

<i>Is it your period?</i>

Oh.

No. No, it's not.

Um, what business of yours...

<i>is going to be terrific, I promise you.</i>

<i>A whole lot classier than</i> Don't Bother,

<i>which I think is a stagy piece of crap

["FÃ¼r Elise" playing on piano]

["FÃ¼r Elise" ends]

[ethereal melody playing on piano]

[man 1] <i>Marilyn deserves better than this.</i>

Marilyn is gonna be a star.


This placeâ€¦

Know what it smells of?

Dreary old love-paste.

Nothing more dreary
than rancid old love-paste.

You know, we've performed in porn films.

Just for the hell of it. Not for cash.

I didn't sneer at the cash. I never do.

[man 2 chuckles]
She's a prude.

Miss Golden Dreams of all people.

[pills rattle]

The human body is meant to be seen.

Admired andâ€¦

Desired.

Not hidden away
like some ugly festering wound.

[man 1] There's plenty of bodies
that should be hidden away.

But not yours, Cassie, and not mine.

And for sure not our girl Norma's.

What are you doing?

Are you looking at her?

Can you see her?

I like to watch myself in the mirror.

I like to watch myself on the toilet even.

In our household, my father, Chaplin,

was all the magic.

He drew all the light into himself

until there was
nothing left inside me but numbness.

Like sleep.

Only in the mirror could I see myself.

Anything I did in the mirror,

I could hear waves and waves of applause.

[ethereal music playing]

Look, Norma Jeane.

There she is.

Your magic friend.


Norma?

Yes.

Were you starved for us?

Yes.

But don't be nice to us.

[man 1] Yeah. Like feeding a cobra.

I'd use a ten-foot stick on me, myself.


â™ª <i>Take me, take me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Thrill me, thrill me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Take me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>This is the moment</i>
<i>Oh, thrill me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Take me, take me in your armsâ€¦</i> â™ª

<i>just as she lived for love.</i>

<i>Like a Lorelei, flaunting her charms
as she lured men on and on</i>

<i>to their eternal destruction.</i>

{\an8}<i>It's Marilyn Monroe,
skyrocketing to new dramatic heights.</i>

{\an8}<i>When a man
took her loveliness in his arms,</i>

<i>he took his life in his hands.</i>

<i>You smell like a dime store.
I know what that means.</i>

<i>Sure, I'm meeting somebody.</i>

<i>Just anybody handy, as long as he's a man.</i>

<i>helpless in her siren spell.</i>

That is not our Norma.

That's not our little Fishie.

<i>nor any man's completely.</i>

<i>And that thought whipped him into a frenzy</i>

<i>that makes the screen thunder
with unparalleled suspense.</i>

[cries out]


[dramatic music playing]

[breathing heavily]

[Norma Jeane] <i>She is pretty, I guess.</i>

But it isn't me, is it?

How about when people find out?

Hell, baby, we found out,
and we still love you.

I justâ€¦ I wish
I could just hide in your arms.

Forever and ever in your arms.

But you don't mean that, Norma.

An actress wants to be seen.

An actress wants to be loved
by a multitude of people.

No. What I really want is you.


I hate this one. I look like an asshole.

{\an8}With my mouth open, like I'm panting.



"Young men-about-town, Charlie Chaplin Jr.

And Edward G. Robinson Jr."

"And blonde sexpot, Marilyn Monroe."

"A threesome."

[Eddy chuckles]

How vulgar.

"A sexpot."

What is a "sexpot"?

Is this the sexpot?


No!
Or this?


[shouting indistinctly]

No! [laughing]

I don't want you seen
in public with them, Norma Jeane.

And in private?

In privateâ€¦

Take precautions.

Oh, Mr. Shinn, that's so cruel.

It's crude and cruel.
And youâ€¦ you know it.

I'm just thinking of your career
and your well-being.

You're thinking of Marilyn.

[Shinn] Yes.
Her career.

Yes. And her well-being.

She doesn't have any well-being.

She's only a career.

They know I'm Norma.

Not Marilyn.

They understand me.

I understand you. I invented you.



I guess I do love you.

I'm jealous of you and Eddy.

Jealous of anybody who looks at you.

If I could love any woman,

it'd be you.

When you say you love me

and when you look at meâ€¦

Who do you see, truly?

The Little Tramp? Do you see him?

No.

I see only you.

People think it's a blessing
being Charlie Chaplin's son.

Like it's a fairy tale,
and I'm the king's son.

But we're cursed, Eddy and me.

We're juniorsâ€¦ of men who never wanted us.

But at least you two have fathers.

At least you know who you are.

[smacks lips] Oh, we knew
who we were before we were born.

You never knew your father.

So you're free.

You can invent yourself.

I love your name.

Marilyn Monroe.
[Eddy] Mm-hmm.


[Eddy laughs]
I love it.

Like you gave birth to yourself.

[Norma Jeane] <i>Because of his eyes.</i>

<i>He had the most beautiful eyes.</i>

<i>Because he'd gazed upon me
with those eyes.</i>

<i>Haunting, soulful eyes.</i>

<i>From a wall
of Mother's long-ago apartment.</i>

<i>Because he would say, seeing meâ€¦</i>

I knew you as soon as I saw you.

Fatherless.

Like me.

And then your mother abandonedâ€¦

And debased.

Like mine.

[Norma Jeane] <i>Because he would love me</i>
<i>as other men would not.</i>

<i>Or could not.</i>

<i>As a twin.</i>

<i>With his soul.</i>

There's Gemini.

See?

Both Norma and I are Geminis.

The fated twins.

Where?

I don't see it. Where?
There.

It's all billions of years old.

Unimaginably vast.

Yet it began out of what?

Particles so small
it couldn't be seen by the human eye.

[Norma Jeane] Look at them up there,
shining so brightly.

And yet, each one is so very much alone.

I'll drink to that.

Let's vow, okay? The three of us.

To always love each other like right now.

And to die for each other, if needed.

We're a triangle.

A triangle can't be divided in two,
like two can be.

We're the Gemini, the three of us.

Like twins. But there's three.



To the Gemini.

To the Gemini.

[ethereal music playing]


Oh God, I knew.

I guess I knew.
I've been feeling so swollen and so happy.



Everything's gonna be fine.

I'm happy, I said.

I want this baby.

My husband and I have been trying
for years. [clears throat]




What is it? You lookâ€¦ fraught. And happy.

[Norma Jeane exclaims]

Oh, Normaâ€¦

You think you are?

Is this what I think it is?
Yes!

[Eddy laughing] Oh, man!

Are you happy for me?

Us? The Gemini, I mean?

Yes!
Yes!

[Cass and Norma Jeane chuckling]

It's like the movies.

The kind of thing that only happens
in the movies.

What?

[Norma Jeane] That little tiger.


[sigh

I had one like him once.

A long time ago when I was a little girl.

Baby's first plaything.

Cute.

Cass, where are you taking us?

I wanna go home.

Right?

Baby's so sleepy.

Oh, this is a vision for baby to see.

Just wait.

Norma, you can look or not,

butâ€¦ there she is.

Mmmâ€¦ Marilyn.

Marilyn.

[Norma Jeane]Â <i>I can't take the role.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

[Shinn over telephone]
<i>Are you still on the line?</i>

<i>Is something wrong?</i>

[Norma Jeane] <i>No, nothing's wrong.</i>

<i>I just can't.</i>

<i>Not now.</i>


<i>You're the newest
box office sensation now.</i>

<i>Zanuck has bought</i>
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes <i>for you.</i>

<i>He wants it as a showcase for you.</i>

How much would I get?


<i>Five hundred a week.</i>

How much would Jane Russell get?


<i>And Russell has to be lent
by another studio.</i>

Yes, but how much?

[Shinn scoffs] <i>The figures</i>
<i>aren't finalized.</i>

How much?


$100,000?

I'll get about $5,000,
and Jane Russell gets $100,000?

And I'm playing the blonde
in <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes?</i>

That's an insult.

I'm gonna hang up now. Goodbye.
[Shinn]<i> Marilyn, wait.</i>

Fuck Marilyn. She's not here.

[chuckles softly]

<i>"To My Baby."</i>

<i>In you</i>

<i>The world is born anew</i>

<i>Before you</i>

<i>There was none</i>

How'd you like to be a grandmother?


What time did we travel to?

Mother, it's May 1953.

I'm Norma Jeane.

I'm here to take care of you.

But your hair is so white.

[Norma Jeane chuckles softly]

When you had me, Mother,
you weren't married, I guess.

You didn't have a man supporting you.

And you had a baby.

That was so brave.

Another girl would'veâ€¦

Well, you know, gotten rid of it.

Of me.

And I wouldn't be here at all.
There wouldn't be any Marilyn.

And she's getting so famous now.

Fan letters, telegrams.

Flowers from strangers.

But you were brave.

You did the right thing.

You had your baby.

You had me.


An illness no one truly understands.

A syndrome of symptoms.

Is it inherited?


My mother's illness, are youâ€¦

Are youâ€¦

Are you born with it in your blood?

[line ringing]

[line picks up]

[Mr. Z] <i>All right, Marilyn, what I'll do</i>
<i>is I'll turn you over to Yvet.</i>

<i>You remember Yvet? She'll help you.</i>



I need help. I need help so badly.
[Yvet] <i>Dear, I'll make the arrangements.</i>

<i>Plan on tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.
You'll be picked up at home.</i>

[dramatic piano music playing]

Please, I wanna go back.

[knocking on glass]
Hey, I've changed my mind.

My mind's my own to change.

Oh, the bright lights.

[breathing heavily]


Please, won't you listen?
I've changed my mind.

Please, don't. Won't you listen?

in twilight sleep.

No, Iâ€¦ wanna go back.

[breathing heavily]

No. Wait.

Wait! Wait! No! No!

No!

[baby crying]

[knock on door]

[knocking continues]

[crew member] Miss Monroe?

â™ª <i>Bye-bye, baby</i> â™ª

[knocking continues]

â™ª <i>Remember you're my babyâ€¦</i> â™ª

Miss Monroe.

Miss Monroe, it's time.

â™ª <i>I'll be lonelyâ€¦</i> â™ª

[knocking continues]

[crew member] Miss Monroe?

â™ª <i>There'll be no other guy</i> â™ª

<i>of the American lottery.</i>

<i>I know it. I'm grateful for it.</i>

And I never take it for granted.
Baseball was my life.

Baseball was my ticket up and out.

And now, well,

I'm retired.

I mean, I have plenty to do, you know,
endorsements andâ€¦ personal appearances,

advisory board meetings.

I guess I sound like a sap.

No. No. [chuckles] No, no.

It must be awfully strange to be aâ€¦

Wellâ€¦ a hero.


Anyway, you don't seem retired.

You're in the paper so much.

Well, not half as much as you, Marilyn.

Who, me?

Wellâ€¦

That's just studio publicity.

Oh, they're awful.

The things they make up.

I know you're supposed to get used to it.


But I just can't.

It really hurts.

How'd you get your start?

What start?

In movies.

In acting.


Iâ€¦

Iâ€¦ I guessâ€¦

[exhales sharply]

I guess I was discovered.

Oh, discovered. How?
[Norma Jeane inhales]

[flash bulb clicks]


Maybe we should leave.

I'm afraid of some of the people here.

Hey.

I know what it's likeâ€¦

To be lonelyâ€¦

To want a better life.

A good, simple life.

A decent life.


I just wanna begin again from zero.

I wanna live inâ€¦

I wanna live in another world.
Away from Hollywood.

I wanna live inâ€¦


â€¦Chekhov!

I wanna move to New York.

And study acting.

Serious acting.

In the movies, they chop you all to bits.

Cut, cut, cut. It's a jigsaw puzzle.

But you're not the one
to put the pieces together.

Oh, but to live in a part.

To just be in it
till the closing curtain every night.

But mostly, Iâ€¦

I wanna settle down.

Like any girl.

And have a family.


Oh, I love children so.

I'm crazy about babies.


[Norma Jeane] <i>Did somebody die?</i>

What is all this?

These flowers.


Am I a corpse?

Is this a funeral home?

[all chuckling]

[Norma Jeane] <i>I'm a slave</i>
<i>to this Marilyn Monroe.</i>

I signed up for a luxury cruise,

but like Lorelei Lee,
I'm in fucking steerage, paddling.

[all laughing]

you don't mean a word of what you say.

If you weren't Marilyn, who'd you be?

Miss Monroe, you're cruel.

Every one of us, everybody in the world,

would give their right arm
to be you, and you know it.

Oh, I do.

"Marilyn, you are the sweetheart of this
and any other month."


"Marilyn, you are a whore,
a blonde tramp."

"Nobody will ever love you,
you disgusting tramp."

"Get off our radio, television,
and out of our movies."

"You're poisoning our children."

"Not a fan."

Like movie critics.

Some of them love Marilyn,
some of them hate Marilyn.

What's that got to do with me?

Yes.

<i>â™ª She is the whore of the month â™ª</i>

Whitey!
<i>â™ª She's a sweet little tramp â™ª</i> [laughing]

â™ª <i>I'm gonna write me a letter</i>
<i>And stick on a stamp</i> â™ª

Miss Monroe,
this is a confidential letter, I think.

He's got a bat for a cock. Sorry.



"This is possibly the most
difficult letter I have ever penned."

[male voice] <i>Honestly, Iâ€¦ I do not know</i>
<i>why I'm contacting you now</i>

<i>after so many years.</i>

<i>The truth is,
I have suffered a heart attack,</i>

<i>and I have contemplated my life
with gravity.</i>

<i>I cannot say I am proud of my behavior
in all cases.</i>

Oh, it's him.

[male voice]Â <i>I am your father,</i>
<i>Norma Jeane.</i>

<i>And I have here before me</i>

<i>an interview with Marilyn Monroe</i>
<i>in the new</i> Pageant.

<i>Reading it, it brought tears to my eyes</i>

<i>when you said
that your mother has been hospitalized,</i>

<i>and you do not know your father.</i>

<i>Although you await him
with every passing hour.</i>

<i>Oh, my poor daughter.</i>

Oh God.

[father] <i>I did not know.</i>
Oh, it's him.

[breathing heavily] I knew.

[exhales sharply]
Watching over me all these years.

I felt it.

<i>Norma Jeane, in person.</i>


<i>my precious daughter,</i>

<i>upon a special occasion in your life</i>

<i>where both father and daughter
can celebrate our long-denied love.</i>

<i>Your tearful father.</i>

[crowd chanting]
<i>Marilyn! Marilyn!Â Marilyn!</i>

Marilyn! Marilyn!Â Marilyn!Â Marilyn!

Marilyn! Marilyn!Â Marilyn!Â Marilyn!


[chanting continues] Marilyn! Marilyn!

[fan screams]
[flash bulbs clicking]

Can I have a moment of your time, please?
Thank you.

[bulb shatters]

[gasps, laughs]

[crowd continues chanting]
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

I've just learned.

Be sure to go alone
to your hotel suite tonight.

Someone special
will be waiting for you there.

Someone special? Oh.

[crowd continues chanting] Marilyn!
[dramatic music playing]

Oh.

Is it my father?

[crowd cheering]

Marilyn, tell our radio audience.
Are you lonely tonight?

When are you two gonna get married?

Married?

No.

Is he here? My father?

It's like a happy ending
of a long, confused movie.

Your father?

I understand that I have a special date?

After the party, in my hotel suite?

Marilyn, Iâ€¦

I just want you to be happy.

I am happy.

I've been happy all my life.

Marilyn, we love each other.

It's time we were married.

Yes, I guess.

Heyâ€¦ Hey. Hey.

I just love you so much.

I just want to protect you

I want to take you away from all of this.

Yeah.

[Norma Jeane] <i>People make spaghetti?</i>

[chuckles]
Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

I mean, not just in a store?

[woman speaking Italian]

That smells delicious.

[speaking Italian]

Can I try it?

Oh. Umâ€¦

Is this to eat?

I mean, standing up?

[footsteps approaching]

So, Marilyn,
what's it like being a movie star?

Umâ€¦

I'm not a star.

I'm just some blonde. [chuckles]

So the hair's real?

No, no.

[all laughing]

[Norma Jeane] <i>Daddy, it's so scary</i>

<i>how a scene with actual people</i>

Like on a bus.

What's to stop it?

Orâ€¦

Or how to figure out what people mean

[baseball bat cracks]
[crowd cheering on TV]

Not like a script.

There's no point.


It just happens.

Like the weather?

Uhâ€¦

You know, honey, in boxing,

they say, "That got his attention"â€¦

When a guy gets hit hard.

Well, it's about attention, honey.
It's about concentration.

And if you don't have thatâ€¦

[announcer speaking indistinctly on TV]


I could have you hurt, you cocksuckers.

Hey, now.
[chuckles]

That's not the right attitude.

I mean, we're on your side.

And the lady's too. She's a realâ€¦

High-class lady, in fact.

[Eddy chuckles]

What we feel, strongly,

is that these, uh, negatives,
well, should be off the market.

So they can't be misappropriated.

[tires screeching]

[breathing heavily]

[dog barking]

[Norma Jeane singing indistinctly

Where the fuck isâ€¦

Hi, Daddy. Where'd you go to?

[Norma Jeane gasps, grunts]

Oh, Daddy. It's my fault.

I don't know how the room got this way.
I've been sick, I guess.

Those photos. That's what you are. Meat.

Daddy, no.

I don't want to be.

Tell them you won't.

This new movie? No deal.

Daddy, I have to work.

It's my life.

You tell them you want better roles.

More serious roles.
You tell them you're quitting.

You tell them
your husband says you're quitting.

Yes.

Yes, I will tell them.

Don't you see how much I love you?
Don't you understand?

I know.

I can't bear to see you
cheapen yourself like that.

[Norma Jeane] <i>I just felt so sorry</i>
<i>for the creature at the end.</i>

"Sorry for the creature"?

What'd you want him to do? Marry the girl?

He was kind of scary-looking,
but he wasn't really all bad.

I think he just craved a little affection,
you know?

A sense of being loved
and needed and wanted.

That's a very interesting point of view.

from the subway? Isn't it delicious?

Sort of cools the ankles, doesn't it?

What do you think would be fun to do now?


[crowd cheering and whistling]

[pensive music playing]

Isn't it delicious?


[cheering and whistling continues]

[breathing heavily]

Daddy?

Daddy, gosh, I'm sorry.

Keeping you waiting so long.
There she is.

You proud of yourself, hmm?

[Norma Jeane] No.

Are you proud of yourself, huh?

Daddy, don'tâ€¦
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

Pleaseâ€¦
Proud of yourself?

What? Huh? Huh?
No.

I'm workin' tomorrow.
Showing off your crotch?

Please don't.
Huh? Huh?

You think that shit works on me?
Think that works on me? Oh, yeah?

My Magda.

<i>My Magda.</i>

<i>Magda. Magda. Magda.</i>

<i>Magda. Magda. Magda.</i>

<i>Magda.</i>

[indistinct chatter, laughter]

Marilyn Monroe?

Here?

Magda? Her?

"When I dream of back there,
I dream of the smell of laundry."

"The tub overflowing and the poem I wrote,
'Magda, ' floating, soaked."

"I'm frantically trying
to collect the pages

before the ink runs in streaks
and the poem comes apart in my hands."

Oh.

He's in love with her.


"Two hundred words."

"A kind ofâ€¦ prayer."

"And I wake in Brooklyn,
nearly 40 years later,

my heart knocking in my chest."

"And I remember her face, blushing,

and her beautiful wide-set eyes
looking up from the poem, and sayingâ€¦"

[inhales sharply]

Not my Magda.


{\an8}[playwright] <i>Magda was my own first love.</i>

Never consummated.

Never even really declared. [chuckles]

Umâ€¦

She would be,

if she was even still alive,
in herâ€¦ in her mid-fifties.

Beautiful Magda.

Middle-aged.

Iâ€¦

I had some ideas about Magda,

if you're interested.

Of course I'm interested.

It's very good of you to care.

Um, this girl, Magda,
she's like Natasha in <i>The Three Sisters.</i>

The one they laugh at
because her dress is the wrong color.

Except, with Magda,
it's the way she speaks English.

Who told you that?

What?

About <i>The Three Sisters</i> and my play?

Nobody.
Kazan?

That I'd been influenced?

Uh, no.

No, I read the play myself.

I always thought Iâ€¦

I always thought I could play Natasha.

I was thinking,
what Chekhov does with Natasha, heâ€¦ heâ€¦

[clears throat] Heâ€¦ he surprises you,

because Natasha turns out to be
so strong and devious.

And cruel.

But your Magda, she never changes much.

She's always so good.

Yes.

Magda is good.

Was good. The original.

She wouldn't dream of being cruel.

Yeah.

And, uh, you have
any other thoughts about Magda?

Hmm?

One thing I was thinking,

Magda wouldn't know how to read.

Isaac shows his poem to her,
and she's only pretending to read it.


Oh my God.

She was illiterate. That's what it was.

Of course.

Well, thank you. Thank you.


Uh, whatâ€¦

Iâ€¦ I suppose I should call you Marilyn,
shouldn't I?

Or is that just a stage name?


You could call me Norma.

That's my true name.

I could call you Norma, if you prefer.

Or, uh, I could call you, uhâ€¦

My Magda.

I'd like that.

My secret Magda.

Yes.

But maybe "Marilyn" when others are around

so there wouldn't be
any misunderstandings.

When others are around,
it doesn't matter what you call me.

You can whistle.

You can call me, "Hey, you."

Hey, you.

Hey, you.

Oh, Daddy!

Daddy, come on.

Baby's hungry. He wants his mama to eat.




Baby makes his wishes known.

Norma's just the vessel.



Not after those potatoes. [chuckles]


Am I your good girl, Daddy?

Yeah. You're my good girl, darling.

Come here.

You're my only love.

[peaceful music playing]

[Norma Jeane] <i>Daddy, you won't ever</i>
<i>write about me, will you?</i>


<i>Why would I do such a thing?</i>

{\an8}[Norma Jeane] <i>It's what people do.</i>

{\an8}<i>Sometimes.</i>

{\an8}<i>Writers.</i>


<i>You and I are not other people.</i>

Darling,

where do you go when you disappear?

Daddyâ€¦

Don't make me go back.

[breathing shakily]

I never wanna be her again.

I got out with my life last time
but only just barely.


Yeah, pregnancy agrees with her.

Even morning sickness,
she's cheerful about.

And then she says, "Oh!"

"Well, this is how
it's supposed to be, I guess." [chuckles]

Yeah. Esther was always so cruel.

It wouldn't occur to Norma to be cruel.

<i>If I have one regretâ€¦</i> [sighs]

â€¦<i>it's that time passes so quickly.</i>


<i>this time, will you?</i>

<i>Not do what you did the last time?</i>

I didn't.

I didn't mean to.
[baby] <i>Yes, you meant to.</i>

<i>It was your decision.</i>

You're not the same baby.

You're this baby.


[Norma Jeane shushes]

He loves us.

He would die for us.

He said so.

Flowers make people feel welcome.

Like they're wanted.

[faucet running]

Mm, darling, you cut 'em
a little too short. See?


What did Iâ€¦ What?

Well, don't worry,
we can repair the damage. Hmm?

Come here.


She's absolutely adorable.
She's nothing like I expected.

She's so well-read.

Rudy's book. [laughs]

I'm just glad somebody has.

Oh my God. Do you guys see that?

This is incredible.

Darlingâ€¦

Aren't you gonna come down
to the beach with us?

Why you hiding in here?

I'm coming, Daddy. I was justâ€¦

Darling, it isn't necessary
to make so much of this visit.

You know Rudy and Jean.

But they don't like me.

They've come to see you.

Norma, stop being so ridiculous.

You know they've come to see us both.

Darling, come down there with me,
huh, will ya? They're waiting.

Hey.

Come out there with me.

You're looking very beautiful.

Hmm?

Come, yeah? Come.

You all right, darling?

[waves crashing]

I'll bring them the beer. [clears throat]

I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

No, just dumb. If I had anyâ€¦

You just dozed off.
Just for a second.

[both laughing]

Oh God.

Oh, stop.

And you thought you wereâ€¦ You look dead.

I need this.
My God. Have it.

[Norma Jeane laughing]

You all right?

Stop screaming.


[both laughing]

[ethereal music playing]

[telephone ringing]

[ringing continues]

[Norma Jeane] Who is it?

[static crackles, whistles]

[telephone slams onto receiver]

[ominous music playing]


[breathing heavily]

[dog barking]

[ominous music intensifies]


[breathing heavily]

[thudding continues]

The circle of light is yours.

You enclose yourself in the circle.
You carry it with you wherever you go.

[thudding continues]

The circle of light is yours.

You enclose yourself in the circle.
You carry it with you wherever you go.

[footsteps approaching]
[whimpering]


[somber music playing]

It's just a dream. It's just a dream.


It's just a dream.

[instruments clinking]

It's just a dream. It's just aâ€¦ [crying]

[menacing music playing]

[Norma Jeane laughs maniacally]

It's just a crazy dream.




Oh Christ.

What an ugly dream.

[telephone ringing]

What a crazy dream.


<i>Or to toy with your heart.</i>

<i>I have been incapacitated by illness.</i>

<i>But you are in my thoughts often.</i>

<i>I have known you only at a distance.</i>

<i>Years passed, and that distance
seemed too great to surmount.</i>

<i>Time is like a fast river
running through us.</i>

<i>Already it isn't.</i>

<i>Soon I will contact you, I promise.</i>

Yes. Yes, but why are you waiting?


[telephone ringing]

[line picks up]
[Eddy over telephone] <i>Normaâ€¦</i>

[breathing shakily]

<i>It's Eddy G.</i>


<i>Choked on his puke and strangled.
Classic alky death, huh?</i>

<i>I found him when I came over this morning.</i>

<i>Cass left a memento for you, Norma.</i>



<i>I was his good buddy, never let him down,
so he left most of his things to me.</i>

<i>But this mementoâ€¦</i>

[breathing heavily]

<i>he'd say.</i>

<i>It meant a lot to him.</i>

<i>"Norma always had my heart," he'd say.</i>

[breathes heavily]

No.



I don't want it.

I don't want it, Eddy.

<i>you don't want it, Norma?</i>

<i>You don't know what it is.</i>

<i>Right, baby. I'll send it.</i>

<i>Look for special delivery.</i>

[Norma Jeane grunts]

Thank you.

Oh, just a minute.

Where's my wallet?

Not in my purse?

Where did I put it?

[pensive music playing]

Oh.

[breath trembling]



But you wanted baby dead too.

You know you did.






[continues sobbing]


[melancholy music playing]


<i>That man is your father.</i>

[birds chirping softly]

[children chattering in distance]

[chirping, chattering fade to silence]
