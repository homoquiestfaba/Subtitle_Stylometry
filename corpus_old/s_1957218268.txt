(gentle, quiet music)

[Woman] Yes, this is where
everybody hopes to make it big,

the City of Angels, the
place of constant change.

Of all the businesses here, one represents

Los Angeles best, a self-storage facility,

also known as public storage,

where people can store, hide, forget,

and rediscover the things they own.

This one here is sitting in Glendale,

between Nebraska and Nixon Boulevards,

between railroad tracks and freeways,

and, like the hundreds
of others of its kind,

it stores unclaimed furniture

of Hollywood divorce
wars, IRS-haunted files,

forgotten love letters,
aged memories, and junk.

Younger Storage is a family business

in the 3rd generation,
and some of the customers

come here every single day.

This is Roger, one of the
regulars, with his new buck.

This is Jonathan Younger, the owner.

And this is Jay.

Good morning.
Mm hmm.

(gentle, calm music)

I don't understand why
you think it's so hard.

Number 15 is still not here.

I don't get it, I really don't.

[Man] Relax.

That's obnoxious.

What do you have for 14?

Eric, tell me.

You hear me!

[Eric] Silverware, Honey.

Wrong!

It's the Singer.

[Eric] What?

My mother's antique sewing machine.

Okay, so the silverware
is in the same box.

[Honey] Yah.

(calm music)

[Jay] Morning, Jonathan.

Hey, good morning.

(Honey shouting indistinctly)

[Eric] Why didn't you
just mark it on the box?

Me, you said we don't need it.

Correct.

[Honey] And now you
don't know what's in it.

I know.

Okay, so tell me.

Cross country skies.

(laughs) I'll tell you what's in there.

The rifle, the big umbrella,

and the Italian pizza cutter.

[Eric] 27 is the skies.

[Honey] Who cares?

You can't keep your balance on it

for two seconds anyway!

[Eric] Honey, please.

I don't feel-

Last time, when kids go,

you almost kill Sonya
simply carrying them.

Well, your last pizza almost
killed the whole family.

If you're having any
trouble with this facility,

I should be more than happy to rectify

any problems whatever.

No, sir, not at all.
He just doesn't get it.

Never.

It's just the situation.

Roger, good morning!

Rabbits still rabbiting, are they?

Yeah, look!

Jonathan Younger.

I know exactly what you're
going through, madam.

I see it every day, and I
want you to rest assured

that not one single
blessed item shall be lost.

Everything will be found.

You travel with the best
movers I know in the business,

and, believe me, I know them all.

All right?
Yeah.

I don't want you upset.

This is my place, and I
want you to feel happy here.

Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

You're German, yes?

Your accent tells me.
Yeah.

(speaking foreign language)

Oktoberfest.

Yes, sir!

Oktoberfest.

Well, well, well.

I, too, am an immigrant of sorts.

Long, long time ago, of course.

The old country.

And I'm here to tell you,
you won't regret your choice.

I've had a dreadful crush on
Los Angeles all these years.

It never ceases to excite me.

Even now, it thrills me, just thrills me.

If, perchance, you find
you need more space

than you'd anticipated on, I want you

to take advantage of my
owner's special, all right?

For certain clients, I provide
a little complimentary space.

(gentle music)


(gentle music)

(phone rings)

Storage.

No, no, no, I'm Mrs. Younger.

Yes, I am the bookkeeper, yes.

Penelope Younger.

Yes.

My husband?

Haven't had my breakfast.

He's not here right now.

Okay, thank you.

Who was that?

IRS.

Good morning, Penelope.

Anything new?

[Penelope] Tax return due this week.

I mean anything important.

[Penelope] No.

No, I have some things for you that are.

This needs a new battery.

My sink still needs a plumber.

And I do prefer my shirts on hangers,

not folded, as they were the
last time, as you well know.

So, if that's it, I'm off to breakfast.

Oh, for Winston's
graduation, double his check,

and remind me to sign it.

What a brilliant woman you are!

(quiet music)

(traffic hums)

Thank you very much, ladies.

You have a nice day now, here?

Thank you, Melodie, put on your glasses.

Bye.

Oh my God, did you see that?

(people chattering)

They came to get coffee to go in my place.

Morning, all!

I can't believe it, I
just can't believe it!

What was she doing in the Valley?

(people chattering)

Did you see her?

[Jonathan] Did I see whom?

Oh, you wouldn't believe it.

Margaret Thatcher?

The Duchess of York?

[Man] You'll never guess.

How about ZigZag Lilian?

(bell rings)

Two locks.

This is yours.

You don't pay, I hang
mine in the second hole.

Oh, that's smart.

You don't pay for a full
quarter, I cut yours off

and leave mine until your
things are auctioned off.

That's fine with me.

You pay for both, no refunds.

Any other sanctions, babe?

I need insurance.

What have you got?

What do you need?

500 and I'll think about it.

Nice skirt, love.

Thanks, Grandpa.

(bell rings)

Good morning, Jonathan.

[Jonathan] Good morning, Frances.

[Frances] Are you enjoying yourself?

[Jonathan] Absolutely.

(Frances chuckles)

Thank you, deary.

Melodie, put on your glasses.

Mother.


God, what is this, pet's heaven?

Mother.

I'm sorry.

Put your glasses on.

(people chattering)

[Man] Newspapers?

What do we have here, a mutiny?

Jonathan, you wouldn't believe it.

[Jonathan] Believe what, Benjamin?

[Benjamin] Who just walked outta here.

ZigZag Lilian.

You see her, too?

Oh, come on, you just got here!

You're joking!
Jonathan, she just

walked out.
Oh!

You mean you didn't see her?

No.
Well, how do you know then?

Because I just missed seeing
them at the coffee shop.

They walked out, you walked in.

That's enough, everybody out.

Come on, out!

(bell rings)

That's enough!

Out!

(people chattering)

I can't hear my music.
Outside, outside.

Who is this ZigZag woman?

Are you serious?
Yeah.

They put her in the paper

every day.
Jonathan, could you lock

me in, please?

Yes, of course, love.

(quiet music)

Thank you, Jonathan.

Don't you forget to let me out

at 5:30.
At 5:30.

(door rattles)

What was your lot number again?

You.
Just kidding.

Are you lost?

(woman shouts)

Whoops!

Thanks!

My china!

(lights click)

(magical music)

(timer buzzes)

Terribly sorry about that.

We're conserving energy.

Johnathan Younger.

I own this establishment.

Oh, my pleasure.

I'm Norma.

I can't find my unit.

What's the number?

72.

72 on the street?

You mean?

That's Piccadilly.

This is Lambeth Walk.

Here, you hold on to
this and I'll haul this.

I hope that when you're
properly stored away,

you'll allow me the pleasure
of showing you my organ.

What?
Now, you saucy thing,

my Wurlitzer.


(quiet music)

We lost everything.

The house, the money, even my friends!

Friends?

Be reasonable, Melodie.

Reasonable?

They think I've been accused of murder.

I'm the one accused of murder.

Now get that Van Gogh stored.

Pronto!

Excuse me.

Hello, Auntie E.

Positively blinding today.

(timer buzzes)

(timer clicks)

(timer buzzes)

Are you all right, child?

Yes, sir.

You sure?

[Melodie] Sure.

All right.

(timer buzzes)

I bet I can cheer you up.

It's just around the corner.

Down Hay Market, up three steps,

and across the bridge.

It's very easy.

I'll leave the door open.

I hope you come.

(timer buzzes)

(playful organ music)

Everything all right, Penny?

(playful organ music)


(playful organ music)

(door creaks)

Sit down, my dear.

(timer buzzes)

(timer clicks)

(playful organ music)

Could you page my daughter out there?

[Penny] Why don't you go and get her?

Because I don't like
dark corridors, my dear.

You feeling all right, honey?

You look-

How?

Sick.

It's the heart.

At your age, you shouldn't
work so hard, darling.

It's not the work.

(playful organ music)

(spoon rattles)

(phone rings)

Storage.

Winston, hello, dear.

[Winston] I didn't get my check yet.

I'm sending your check today.

So tell me, how are you doing?

Well, your grades haven't been that good.

Do you really think you deserve?

[Winston] Of course I deserve it.

Can you put Dad on, please?

Sure, your father's here.

[Winston] Thank you.

Mm hmm, hold on one moment.

Jonathan.

[Jonathan] You feel better now?

Thank you so much, I-

No, no, it is not me.

It's the music.

[Penny] Jonathan, Winston line two.

That's my son.

You will excuse me?

He's calling from England.

He's in college, a business major.

Bye.

Bye, thanks, Mr. Younger.

No Cs, no Ds, just As for
my only beloved son, right?

Hello, boy, how's the fog?

It's foggy, all right.

Oh, Daddy.

I miss you so much.

Well, I miss you, too.

[Winston] I wish that I
could just drop everything.

Poor boy.

Daddy.

I need more money.

Just tell me, how much?

[Winston] Everything's so expensive.

I know, I know.

Bloody inflation everywhere.

No, the invitation.

[Jonathan] The invitation.

Oh, for your graduation party.

Yes, I don't wanna look cheap.

A Younger?

Never!

Give them champagne.

Thanks, Dad, you're wonderful.

Ah, no, Winston, you're wonderful!

And you will be wonderful.

Have you finished your exams yet?

[Winston] I've got two more to go.

How many As so far?


Winston!


Winston!

(phone slams)

Antiquated English telephone systems.

(woman whispering foreign language)

Just talked to Winston in London!

What a talent.

What a Younger.

Oh, he's gonna make it big, that boy.

He's really something.

[Roger] Look at him,
he's really something.

It's his 15th time this morning.

You know, Roger, in a couple of weeks,

he and I are going to
start working together.

Father and son, building an empire,

a self-storage chain
stretching across the country.

Younger Self-Storage.

Younger and Son, Younger and Younger.

Younger and Younger!

Yeah.
Younger and Younger!

Roger, a new sign, before
he arrives, a new sign!

(quiet, peaceful music)

Hi, Mr. Younger.

(calm music)

ZigZag Lilian was here today.

What?

And her daughter Melodie.

Wow.

Wow, indeed.

"All help came too late.

"Max was dead."

What are you around about?

Go on, come on, get outta here.


(quiet music)

They were back.

[Jonathan] Who was back?

ZigZag and Melodie,
while you were sleeping.

Penny!

All right, Penelope, this time (shouting).

What am I around here, bloody nothing?

No, don't try that trick
because it won't work.

We had an important,
an important customer!

Shh!
And you didn't wake me!

Why, Penelope, why?
Shh!

Tax return's due tomorrow.

The hell with your bloody tax return!

Can't you get it through your skull

what's important in our business?

It's human relationships.

All you're concerned about is adding up

your lousy, cheap, little
(shouting indistinctly).

(phone rings)

Storage.

How many?

Confirmed, 41 to 47.

96.

(Jonathan sighs)

Winston's check, please.

[Penelope] It's doubled.

Treble it.

Why, Penelope, why?

Why did you choose not to wake me?

Your siesta.

Remember the last time?

You know what I think?

I think you hate me.

You think I married you just to get

my green card, don't you?

You think I married you just to get

into your parents'
business here, don't you?

That's what's been stewing
in that brain of yours,

and now you're taking your revenge

after 25 years of marriage!

26.

I have a little surprise
for you, Penelope.

I want a new sign.

25 foot by 12.

It should read "Younger and Younger,

"The Discreet Self-Storage."

Winston and I are going to take this mess

and turn it into a lucrative,
elegant establishment,

where important customers are treated

with the kind of respect they deserve.

We can't afford it.

That's my decision.

I won't order it.

You won't order it?

You won't order it?

You won't order it?

You won't order it?

(gun bangs)


My organ!

You shot my organ!

That's the last time, Penelope!

I'm out, I'm gone, where are my keys?

Where are my bloody keys?

[Penny] Where they belong.

(Jonathan shouts)

Jonathan!

Jonathan!

You forgot to open up Frances.

Not me, Penny's in charge now!

(sad music)

(lift whines)

(motorcycles rumbles)

(horn honks)

(men shout)

(timer buzzes)

Did you kill him this time?

No, but I should have.

[Frances] Well, maybe next time.

Frances.

(timer buzzes)

(Motorcycle rumbles)

(horn honks)

9:15 at the Serenade, on the money.

Hope you're all having a good old time.

Sweet dance the night away.

[Flower Seller] Evening, Mr. Younger.

Morning, Jay.

Hello, hello.

[Frances] Jonathan,
how about letting me in?

You're coming in early.

Seen this yet?

ZigZag trial, blood on the skateboard.

Morning, Frances.
Morning, Jay.


Wait, seven again?

No, no, okay, okay, so, like, every time

he kind alike makes you angry,

and then he like totally won't stop,

you just shoot his organ?

No, no, no.
Oh!

Oh my God!

I don't believe it.

I mean, you were always
like the shiest little thing

in school, even the day you got married.

I remember that day so well.

You and your polka dot
petticoat and Howard Schlitzman.

Are you still with him?

Oh, no, oh, please!

Howard was more like a one night stand.

Actually, he was more
like a one night standby.

Bye.


Oh, but you, married 26 years to, like,

the totally hottest man in town.

Jonathan, whoa.

So, Penny, tell me, come
on, what's your secret?

(blower whines)

Why don't I show you around?

We're still as old-fashioned

as when my parents still ran this place.

(blower whines)

Morning, Penelope.

Hello, Sue, long time no see.

Hi.

Whoa!

[Penny] Battery's replaced.

Glad to see you haven't
changed, Jonathan.

You still got it.

[Jonathan] Let me show you around.

[Sue] See you later, Penny!

(Sue shouts and giggles)

Whoa! (giggles)

Whoa! (giggles)

(organ clangs)

(Sue shouts)

(organ clangs)
(Sue shouts)

(Penny gasps)

Jonathan.

Jonathan!

Jonathan!

Jonathan, Penny's knocked out!

Penny's knocked out!

Jonathan!

Hey, Penny!

Oh my God!
Penny.

Penny, Penny!
Knocked out!

[Benjamin] Penny!

I have no pulse.

I have no pulse!

Penny, Penny.
Oh my god, I have no pulse!

Penny, breathe, breathe, breathe!

[Woman] Penny.

[Benjamin] Penny!

Penny!

(Sue shouts)

I need help!

I need help here!

Penny, breathe, breathe!

(droning ambient music)

[Announcer] L-T-7,
please remove your car

to the main entrance.

[Woman] That's me, that's me!


Finally!

[Jonathan] You and me, together at last.

Me and you forever!


(Jonathan cries)

My father's not wearing a white suit.

I didn't want to hurt your feelings

because of your mother's funeral. (cries)

Someone took my cart.

Officer!

(calm, playful music)

(Winston yawns)

It's a far, far better
place that she's in now.

I'm sorry, Dad, it's jet lag.

That's all right.

(graceful, playful music)

Welcome home, Mr. Younger II.

Mother?

I dreamt she was back.

Mother?

It's all right, I'm here for you now.

After you have some rest,
I have a surprise for you.

Driver, put that on the
lift over there, will you?

[Driver] Sure thing, Pop.


[Winston] I'm not going
to trip on anything, am I?

Turn around.

Now you can take your hands down.

Okay, on the count of three.

One, two, three, pull!


[Winston] Dad, this is a big sign!

Dad!

Partners!
No, this is too much!

Too much, it's just the beginning.

This is the prototype.

They're going to be all over the world.

Where do you wanna eat, your choice.

I don't know, I'm kinda-

Tired, I'll order pizza.

Chicago deep dish okay?

Okay.
Extra cheese?

Yeah.

Jonathan Younger, Chicago
deep dish, extra large.

Extra cheese.

Green peppers, sausage.

1635 Nebraska.

That's three blocks east of Nixon.

Great, thanks.

[Announcer] The ZigZag trial

at the Beverley Hills town court.

Donna Vetter reports.

Former best-dressed
man of Beverley Hills,

Max Beerbrower, was
ready for his usual visit

to Chastan's Bar and Grill,

but, this evening, he would never arrive.

His wife Lilian, the former well-known

(speaker drowned out).
Do you know who

ZigZag Lilian is?
One of our customers.

[Donna] Are accused of
preparing a deathtrap.

How did you know that?
For the real estate

tycoon Max.

We tried to reconstruct the crime.

Melodie places a skateboard at the top

of the staircase.

Lilian howls over a killer migraine.

Max exits the powder
room to stand by Lilian.

He's at the gallery when Lilian appears,

yelling for a martini.

Max rushes to the stairs.

Lilian calls him back, her
head pounding with pain.

He turns and steps onto the skateboard,

which catapults him an
unbelievable six feet

into the air and over the rail

in an acrobatic backwards flip.

He lands in front of
Melodie on the marble floor,

his head cracked open.
(Jonathan laughs)

At a press conference, Lilian stated

that she recalled nothing but zigzags,

which experts describe as
a typical migraine feature.

The irony is Max Beerbrower
had lost his entire fortune

in a huge speculation fraud
only hours before his death.

Accident or murder?

You decide.

It's an exciting business, Winston.

People from all walks of life
come through these doors,

taking shelter, sheltering secrets.

But the most amazing, most exciting,

the most thrilling thing is
the constant stream of women.

You never have to go out
to look for a pretty girl.

You're like a big fish in the ocean.

You just open your mouth
and the plankton drifts in.

You're like a hunter who
never goes into the woods

because your prey comes
into your backyard.

(Winston snores)

Oh, Winston.

My sunshine.

The apple of my eye.

Welcome home.

It's five past nine, Johnny boy.

I think Daddy deserves a
little West Coast swim.

What do you think?

(Winston snores)
Good.

Okay, there you go.

There you go, baby.

(tense music)

(gentle music)

It's time to start getting it out there.

Girls, girls, girls.

Oh, the Wurlitzer, it's yours?

But I thought that we.

I don't.
Hey, Roger, Winston's home.

See, I just arrive
from college yesterday.

Yeah, I know.

I don't know.
How's you bun today?

[Roger] World record.

[Winston] I'll have my dad call you.

So how was your first night home?

Good, I was up at four this morning.

I walked around a little bit.

I had breakfast at the corner cafe.

Said hi to Roger.

So, ready to go?
Yeah, of course.

Self-storage management,
lesson number one,

rent out space.

Lesson number two, get
cash before they leave.

Lesson number three,
deposit cash in the bank.

Ah, a board meeting.

A board meeting.
Yes!

So there's not even a
typewriter around here.

How did you manage to type?
You knew your mother.

She was so old-fashioned.

She made such a fuss about her receipts

and her files and her handwritten papers.

After she was gone, I tried
to straighten things up,

but I couldn't.

Well, what we need is a computer.

Oh, a computer?

I knew the money I
spent for your education

wasn't wasted.

All you have to do is write
out a couple of checks.

The income tax return that I mailed

came back marked "incomplete."

It did?
Yeah.

But that won't be a problem

for my new business partner, will it?

All I need is my newspaper
and my weekly cash.

Penny.

Penny used to do that for me.

Oh.

[Woman] Hi, Mr. Younger.

Hi.

Plankton.

I've got a house on Duncan, Jonathan.

Our house is in perfect
condition right away.

So I want to find my
(speaking foreign language).

Your blankets?

Yeah, exactly.

Let's see, and I need
the towels and the forks.

The spoons.

Cutlery, silverware.

No, we don't have silver.

Only normal.

Let's see.

Right here, no.

Okay, number 25.

This, no.

Jonathan.

Penny!



Oh, Mr. Younger!

Oh, no, oh, no, Mr. Younger.

[Jonathan] I don't
want to hurt anything.

Oh, no.

Are you all right, Mr. Younger?

Yes, of course.

Absolutely.

Oh, careful!
Father?

It's just customer service.

I just got a call.

The check for the new sign bounced.

That's not possible.

How much was it?

You don't know?

No.

13,900.

(Penelope giggles)

For the sad reason
that you're all aware of,

I was not able to attend
my son's graduation,

but I did, at least, want to see him

in his cap and gown and
share that with you,

so, if I may propose a toast

to the first Younger ever
with a college degree,

Winston Churchill Younger!

Hooray!

[Jonathan] Hooray!

My buck!

My buck!

Oh, fuck, my buck!


Catch him, get him.

Over here!

[Jonathan] That's enough, get out!

Did you complete the tax return, dear?

Oh, the Wurlitzer.

I forgot to tell him.

I'm sorry, I'll call you.
Morning, partner!

Rabbits, rabbits are not
allowed in the office.

Bravo!

And my weekly cash?

I've started to look up
things in my textbooks,

but most of it doesn't really apply.

[Jonathan] That's no
problem, take your time.

Well, see, I made a list of everything

that I need to know from you.

Have you had breakfast yet?

[Winston] Yes.

Good, good, well, I'm
gonna go and get mine.

Did you get the income
tax returns completed?

No, Dad, I need to talk to you.

Yes.

Yes, yes, yes.

It's darn hot in here.

Keep it, keep it.

Winston?

Would you lock me in, please?

[Winston] Of course.

Penny, are you there?

(mysterious, plucking music)


It's ruined, it's ruined!


Good morning, Jay.


Something's wrong.

(calm music)

Excuse me, excuse me.

[Frances] Who is it?

It's me Winston, can I talk to you?

[Frances] Well, you
have my lock combination.

(mysterious music)

He won't show me anything.

I have a list, a fine list, of things

that need to be done, questions,

but he just always slips away.

I mean, he could explain it to me.

You think he could?

Of course.

I'm here, I am willing to do it,

he did it all those
years, he did a great job.

I don't know, maybe he's
afraid to pass it along.

I don't get it.

He thinks that because I went to college

that I know everything
that I need to know,

but, don't tell anybody, but
I wasn't an A student, okay?

I wasn't that bad, either,
but that stuff is all theory.

He has the experience, I don't.

Winston, you think that
Jonathan ran this place?

Can I come closer?

(magical music)

Mother?

Yes, Winston.

Well, he did the show,
and she did the work.

Mother did everything.

I can't believe he blinded me

with that white suit all these years.

"Blinded with his white suit."

What?

You just helped me out another time.

How come?


When you were a boy
and you used to visit me,

you always had to know
how the story continued.

That's true.

And maybe I was stuck,
but I had to tell you

because I couldn't disappoint you.

You had to have your story.

So, today, I've been stuck with this

mother-daughter relationship.

ZigZag Lilian and...

What's her name again?

Melodie.

(magical music)

You can think of me,
but you can't touch me.

(magical ambient music)

[Jonathan] Lilian.

[Man Under Hood] This thing here.

That's the problem.

It just overheated a little bit.

Just let the car sit for a little while.

Come on inside.

Have a coffee or something.

[Winston] We need to talk!

Let me wake up first.

Right, right, you need to wake up!

This is not going to continue!

No more three hour cat naps.

What?

I am not Penny.

I am not your slave!

I am your son, I need a partner.

If it's not going to be you,
it will be someone else!

Oh, sonny boy.

Don't you sonny boy me!

Not in public, Winston.

You never (groans).

Too embarrassing.

Embarrassing, embarrassing?

You're the one who's embarrassing!

(blower whines)

Shut up!

Not now.

Not now, sorry.

Well, young man, what can I do for you?

[Winston] Answer my questions.

Ask.

Exactly how much money
do we have in our account?

Enough.

Nothing, we have nothing in our account!

We are broke, we're in
debt up to our ears!

What, this is exactly what you do.

Every time something
gets up, you slip away!

You know nothing about this place.

You don't even know how
to get your own cash.

You don't know anything
about the business,

you don't know anything about your family.

You don't know about
anything but your clothes,

which, by the way, reek
ever since she died

because you can't your sweaty
shirts to the cleaners!

(woman chatters)

All you care about is breakfast,
lunch, women, women, women!

Right, Dad, you're sick.

You're sick in the head!

My husband and I, we ran a movie theater

25 years ago, and, when it had to close,

we stored our mighty
Wurlitzer organ in parts

and boxed at this place.

Now, before my husband died,

the beautiful sound of that organ

came back to his mind, and he rang

this place several times.

Now, I just want you to know that nobody

should bother and that I have
no use for it any longer.

Thank you very much, sir, bye.

Just going to go and air them out.

(motorcycle rumbles)

Ah, Penny!

(tires screech)

[Driver] Crazy fucking asshole!

What the hell are you
trying to do, kill me?

Get up, get up!

(calm music)

(Jonathan chuckles)

Are you okay, Dad?

Uh huh.

Penny.

[Penny] Yes?

I think I'm getting a crush on you.

Go on.

I find you more and more beautiful,

more and more desirable.

[Winston] Dad, are you still okay?

Uh huh.

Don't worry, I'll work hard, promise.

May I ask you something?

[Penny] Yes.

Why do you look so young?

Because you remember
me when we fell in love.

[Jonathan] Oh.

I just made that up.

Oh?

You see, on Earth, you
grow older and older,

and, here, we grow younger and younger.

[Jonathan] Younger and
younger until you're babies?

No, silly!

Until we reach precisely the age

that we liked ourselves the best.

Are you there yet?

Not quite.

(quiet music)

(people chattering)
(blower whines)

(horn honks)

(blower whines)

Just give me a little time.

Winston, are these
things are staying here?

If you don't pay your
rent within 10 working days,

I guarantee we're going to auction.

Sorry.
What's this?


People, if you'll just give
me a little bit of time,

I guarantee everything will be done

to your full satisfaction.
(bell ringing)

Winston!

Your father wants to have lunch with you.

[Delivery Woman] A nuthouse.

Enjoy your lunch, and think of me,

your caring waitress Jaime Lee. (giggles)

Good.
Huh?

Very good idea.

What?

The loan on our property.

Yeah, Dad, once the new system's set up,

things will run much more smoothly,

and the loan will be
(speaker drowned out).

(soft music)

We should do this more often.

What?

Discuss business over lunch.

Yes, yes, let's do that.

We could have done that all these years.

I'm so sorry.

Hey, hey, it's okay.

We both had a tough day, it's all right.

It'll be fine now.

Do you still love me?

Of course, I always loved you.

Always.

You're so beautiful, so young.

You're beautiful, too.

Do you remember when you used to play

the Wurlitzer for me, the first time?

I sat in your lap.

And you were so proud of yourself

because you put it together.

All those thousands of pieces!

And then we danced.

(romantic music)

Oh, Penny.

[Winston] It's okay, Dad, it's okay.

Winston.
Mm hmm.

My taco's getting cold.

Got him!

Everyone's back!

Good deal!


I'm sorry.

Roger, no, I-

[Roger] I kill you!

Penny?

Where are you, Penny?

I miss you.

My mother, I think,
used to do this by hand.

She was 10 times faster, but,

as soon as I get this programed-

The better you feed your pig,

the better your pork will taste, right?

Right.

Good afternoon.

[Winston] How was your siesta?

It was great.

[Winston] I need you.

I'm going to go and play for a little,

and then I'll be right back.

I need you, right now, please.

See you later.
No.

(pencil snaps)
(phone rings)

Younger Self-Storage, can I help you?

Can you hold, please?

I'm sorry.

This just isn't working right now.

It's new equipment.

Would you come back later?

(computer beeps)

This is Winston, may I help you?

Mr. Younger's away from
his desk right now.

Uh huh, oh, it's here somewhere.

Yes, I know.
(caller chattering)

â™ª Tell me what to say, I'm going crazy â™ª

â™ª Tell me what to do, I need you so â™ª

What's wrong?

Yeah, I know.

Like mother, like son.

[Winston] Huh?

Well, your mother
didn't like it, either.

What do you mean by that?

â™ª Take this sinner back into your heart â™ª

Her pens were on the floor, you know,

and her body keeled over,
and the music went on and on!

â™ª Don't you think that
we could start all over â™ª

â™ª With the moment I first saw your face â™ª

â™ª You know, when we were young and easy â™ª

â™ª And love was light and breezy â™ª

â™ª Your kisses sweet,
and even now I taste â™ª

â™ª Show me your face â™ª

â™ª I know you're here â™ª

â™ª I can smell your perfume as
it drifts through the room â™ª

â™ª Hear your voice in my ear â™ª

â™ª Your fingers touch mine â™ª

â™ª Then you vanish in space â™ª

â™ª Darling, show me your face â™ª

Come on.
It's too embarrassing.

I have to know.

He was, shit.

Your father was not
alone up there, you know?

(soft music)

I heard them doing it.

â™ª Come to my arms â™ª

â™ª Squeeze me to death â™ª

â™ª Won't you kiss me and hold me â™ª

â™ª And rock me and roll me â™ª

â™ª Til I've no more breath â™ª

â™ª My penny from heaven,
of infinite grace â™ª

â™ª Won't you show me your face â™ª

Penny heard them, too.

Shit!

He killed her!


â™ª Darling, desist â™ª

â™ª Don't take this amiss â™ª

â™ª But your lovers of late
will be clearly irate â™ª

â™ª If we were to kiss â™ª

â™ª I'd melt in your arms â™ª

â™ª Though I died in disgrace â™ª

â™ª I'd show you more than my face â™ª

Stop playing, stop it!

Open this door now, stop it!

â™ª Sweep me away â™ª

â™ª Right off my feet â™ª

â™ª And like Ginger and Fred â™ª

â™ª We'll dance right into bed â™ª

â™ª On a movie set street â™ª

â™ª Remember the time â™ª

â™ª That my heart used to race â™ª

â™ª And this was my face â™ª

(graceful music)

(woman sighs)

(graceful music)

The discreet self-storage!

(graceful music)


(graceful music)


(graceful music)

[Jonathan] But I still can't feel you.


(playful music)


(playful music)

â™ª One last embrace â™ª

â™ª Though you've been cruel â™ª

â™ª I can't resist any man â™ª

â™ª Who persists on playing love's fool â™ª

â™ª Baby, now is the time â™ª

â™ª And this is the place â™ª

â™ª To fall flat on your face â™ª




[Melodie] Mr. Younger, what happened?

[ZigZag Lilian] Oh, well,
he fell from the roof, stupid.

How come you know this bum?

He's my father, he works in this office.

Oh, come on, kids, call an ambulance,

get me some water, blankets, think!

Go in the office and dial nine.

Everything will be fine.

[Jonathan] ZigZag Lilian.

[ZigZag Lilian] Now, come
on, that's not important now.

[Jonathan] How's Max?

What?

Your husband, Mr. Beerbrower.

Well, everyone knows that he's-

Dead.

Death by skateboard.

South to mortality.

They should be on their way.

Thanks for waiting, and-

Stop that.

What's your name?

Winston.

Hi, I'm Lilian.

[Melodie] Here, Mother.

This is my daughter Melodie.

Here.

Relax and take it easy.

Okay, try this.

Ah, he's adorable.

He'll be okay.

Lucky those boxes were over there.

[Winston] I don't care.

[Melodie] Do you wanna talk about it?

No.

At least you have a real father.

A real father.

No, seriously.

My mother, she dragged me
from husband to husband.

I never had to remember their names.

I'd meet them, call them Father,

they'd leave, and I'd call
the next one Father, too.

That's sad.

It's overwhelming.

I know how you feel.

I think I'd really like
to be me, just me, for once.

Oh, Penny.

Oh, Penny.

Oh, excuse me.

Penny, hi.

Would you like to have dinner with me?

I have a date already.

What?

You have a date?

No.

No!

With whom?

Max!

Melodie, Winston, get over here.

Come on.

[Max] May I?

Thank you, you're very kind.

May I?
Thank you.

I fancy you're new around here.

Why would you say that?

Your age.

Oh, no, this is my ideal age.

I never felt better.

I can see that.

You're beautiful.

(Max laughs)

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Who's Penny?

[Winston] My dead mother.

Holy shit.

He's seeing Max with her.

He's seeing my dead
husband with his dead wife.

How does he look?

Awfully well, actually.

Penny!

Don't leave me like this.

Have you ever made love on a cloud?

It's been a while, Max.

(siren wails)

Do you prefer harder or softer clouds?

(siren wails)



[Jonathan] I beg you, please.

No, no way.

It's the only way I can get her back.

Please?

If you break in there and
play that goddamn thing,

I'll break each and every finger of yours,

one by one.

She's with him.

She's with Max, making
love on a bloody cloud.

Hey, what are you doing over there?

Father!

[Jonathan] Yes.

You're not gonna cause
us any more trouble.

She's just trying to make me jealous.

She wants me, and she
wants me to want her.

And I do, I want her.

Except you're too late.

She was only sitting in
front of you for 26 years.

I want to be young with her.

I want her to forgive me.

[Winston] I'm not gonna let
you do this a second time.

There's just one thing
I have to wait for.

No.
Just one thing.

It's all right, it's okay.

Winston.

Father, you're staying
right here, come on.

Winston.

There's no easy way out, all right?

I want you to come away from the edge.

Winston?
And just give me

your hand, what are you doing?
Winston!

Oh my God!
No!


(cat screeches)

He's a sexist, he killed her.

He killed my mother with his Wurlitzer.

[Melodie] His what?

He dragged those women
upstairs, and he raped them,

and my mother, my mother had
to listen to it, right here.

[Melodie] That's not true, Winston.

You don't know.

I do know.

Hey, look at me.

He played for me, too.

[Winston] He did what?

When?

Before the trial, you weren't here.

And?

[Melodie] I was storing some things.

And he dragged you upstairs, too, I bet.

He probably raped you like the others.

No, Winston, he invited me,

'cause I was really upset and crying.

He comforted me, touched me.

Touched you?

He touched you?

Yes.

He touched my heart.

He didn't lay a finger on me.

He was a real gentleman.

That's not true.

Yes, it is.

(gentle music)

Does it hurt?

Would you mind if I helped
you straighten up this mess?

[Winston] If you know how to.

(gentle music)

What did she look like?

I can't remember.

You don't have any pictures of her?

I didn't take any.

Penny!


Penny.


Thank you for dinner.

The (speaking foreign
language) was really good.

My tongue's still on fire.

His morning hangout.

What?

What did you say?
Oh.

Nothing.

So where did you get
that cute French accent?

Boarding school, Paris.

Watch your step.
Okay.

Are you okay?
Fine.

My mother gave it to me, I like it.

Beat you.

That seems wrong.

That irresponsible bastard
went and left this up

because he's upstairs
playing with his organ!

[Melodie] No!

(playful organ music)

It plays by itself.

That faker!

Stop!

(discordant organ music)

He's not here, either.

Come on.

Gone!

Call your mother and see if he's there.

That bloody bastard!

â™ª His mama don't dance â™ª

â™ª His daddy don't dance â™ª

â™ª His brother don't think it's cool â™ª

â™ª When he gets on the floor â™ª

â™ª And starts to swing â™ª

â™ª He's a happy, dancing fool â™ª

Come on, Penny, I know you're in there.

â™ª He's dressed to please â™ª

â™ª He's the honey bee â™ª

â™ª All the girls buzz up to see â™ª

â™ª Then he throws them around â™ª

â™ª And sets 'em down â™ª

â™ª And leaves 'em with knocking knees â™ª


â™ª Don't you understand â™ª

â™ª He's a simple man â™ª

â™ª The dance floor is his stage â™ª

â™ª If they give him a dance â™ª

â™ª And take a chance â™ª

â™ª He's started, don't you see â™ª

â™ª Your doctor don't dance â™ª

â™ª The banker don't dance â™ª

â™ª The mayor may not approve â™ª

â™ª But when the lights go down â™ª

God, there he is, dancing!

Look, he's dancing!

Strange.
It's just not like him.

(jazzy music)

He's made a complete fool out of me.

(jazzy music)

[Woman] Look, it's ZigZag Lilian!

It is!
Wow, she's right there.

Look, over there!

Yeah, look.
I'll handle this, Winston.

(jazzy music)

You look stunning, Lilian.

And you're a brilliant dancer, Jonathan.

(jazzy music)

â™ª Don't you understand â™ª

â™ª He's a simple man â™ª

â™ª The dance floor is his stage â™ª

â™ª If they give him a dance â™ª

â™ª And give him a chance â™ª

â™ª Don't you see â™ª

â™ª His mama don't dance â™ª


[Man] Come on, let's dance, come on.

(swinging music)

(gentle music)

This is what I have been waiting for.

(magical music)

I love you, Jonathan.

Show me your face.

I can feel you!

I can feel you.

Oh, God, I can feel you!

â™ª When we embrace â™ª

â™ª We flow back in time â™ª

â™ª Younger and younger
and younger and younger â™ª

â™ª No reason or rhyme â™ª

â™ª Your sins are forgiven â™ª

â™ª Our love is divine â™ª

â™ª You're eternally mine â™ª

Morning, Winston.

Morning, Melodie, could
you lock me in, please?

Hiya, Penny.

A lot has changed here
at our storage facility.

Melodie and Winston are married

and have a beautiful little boy.

My book on the Beerbrower
case was not very successful,

but I'm writing a new one.

It's called "My Penny from Heaven."

Gee!

Damn it!

I know how you feel, monsieur.

I have the best customers
from all over the world.

Rest assured, by the end of the day,

every single item will be found,

so why don't you relax for a while,

have a nice cup of English tea

in our Wurlitzer lounge?

Heel, Howard.

Jonathan, come to Grandma.

[Frances] And here he is, Jonathan II.

He's already after the girls.

Isn't he adorable?

â™ª Show me your face â™ª

â™ª I know you're here â™ª

â™ª I can smell your perfume â™ª

â™ª As it drifts through the room â™ª

â™ª Hear your voice in my ear â™ª

â™ª Who else in the world â™ª

â™ª Is my angel of grace â™ª

â™ª Darling, show me your face â™ª

â™ª Don't you think that
we could start all over â™ª

â™ª With the moment I first saw your face â™ª

â™ª Oh, when we were young and easy â™ª

â™ª And life was light and breezy â™ª

â™ª With kisses sweet and even now I taste â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª Come to my arms â™ª

â™ª Squeeze me to death â™ª

â™ª Won't you kiss me and hold me â™ª

â™ª And rock me and roll me
til I'm out of breath â™ª

â™ª Walk out of my dreams into my embrace â™ª

â™ª Love, show me your face â™ª

(graceful music)

â™ª His daddy don't dance â™ª

â™ª His brother don't think it's cool â™ª

â™ª When he gets on the floor â™ª

â™ª And starts to swing â™ª

â™ª He's a happy, dancing fool â™ª

â™ª Don't you understand â™ª

â™ª He's a simple man â™ª

â™ª The banker don't dance â™ª

â™ª The mayor may not approve â™ª

â™ª But when the lights go down â™ª

â™ª And the music plays â™ª

â™ª Your feet just start to move â™ª

(graceful music)
