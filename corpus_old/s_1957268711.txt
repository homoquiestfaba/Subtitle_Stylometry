 ( train whistle blows )
 GOOD-BYE.

WHEN I WAS 12 AND MY SISTER
LILY DALE WAS 11,

MY FATHER DIED.

AND SOON AFTER, MY MOTHER
MARRIED AGAIN AND WENT

TO LIVE IN HOUSTON.

MY STEPFATHER AGREED TO HAVE
MY SISTER LIVE WITH THEM,

BUT HE THOUGHT BOYS MY AGE
SHOULD WORK

AND SUPPORT THEMSELVES.

SO I GOT A JOB CLERKING
AT A PLANTATION STORE.

WHEN I WAS 19,
I GOT A LETTER FROM MY MOTHER

ASKING ME TO COME VISIT HER
AND MY SISTER IN HOUSTON.

 ( train whistle blows )
I DECIDED TO GO.

 ( train whistle blows )
 SHE SAYS,

"JUST A MINUTE, SON."

SHE WALKS ACROSS THE STREET,
TELLS THE LADY OFF

SOMETHING AWFUL.

 ( all laugh )
 ( train whistle blows )

 MIND IF I SIT WITH YOU, SON?

 NO, MA'AM.

 I CAN'T STAND A TRAIN TRIP
WITHOUT A LITTLE COMPANY.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

 HOUSTON.

 SO AM I.

HOUSTON YOUR HOME?

 NO, MA'AM,
I'M GOING ON A VISIT.

 WHO ARE YOU VISITING,
YOUR GRANDMA?

 NO, MY MOTHER.

 YOUR MOTHER.

YOUR MOTHER, NOT YOUR DADDY?

 NO, MY DADDY'S DEAD.

SHE'S MARRIED AGAIN.

 WELL, I LIVE IN HARRISON NOW.

USED TO LIVE IN HOUSTON,
BUT MY HUSBAND LOST HIS JOB

AND GOT A POSITION AT THE GIN
IN HARRISON.

HE'S A BOOKKEEPER.

I HOPE HE'LL KEEP THAT.

( sighs) WE HAVE A PROBLEM--
MY HUSBAND, I MEAN.

HE DRINKS.

OH, HE'S FINE ON A JOB,
BUT THEN HE GETS TO DRINKING

AFTER TWO OR THREE MONTHS,
AND THEY LET HIM GO.

HE'S TAKEN THE KEELEY CURE
MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.

I'M GOING IN TO SEE ABOUT
SHIPPING OUR FURNITURE

TO HARRISON.

WE SOLD OUR HOME IN HOUSTON.

 WHOSE HOUSE ARE YOU RENTING
IN HARRISON?

 WELL, THEY CALL IT
THE OLD ROBEDAUX PLACE.

THEY SAY IT'S A SAD HOUSE.

THE MAN WAS A BRILLIANT LAWYER
AND DRANK HIMSELF

RIGHT INTO THE GRAVE.

MR. COONS SAYS--
 THAT WAS MY HOUSE.

AT LEAST, IT WAS MY FATHER'S.

I LIVED THERE UNTIL I WAS EIGHT,
UNTIL MY MOTHER AND FATHER

SEPARATED.

 SEPARATED?

OH, MERCY.

THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

I HOPE IT DIDN'T END IN DIVORCE.

 NO, MA'AM.

 IS IT THAT YOUR DADDY DIED
A DRUNKARD?

 YES, MA'AM.

 I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU, SON.

I KNOW WHAT THAT CAN MEAN.

ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN, SON?

 YES, MA'AM, I GUESS SO.

 WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU GUESS SO?

THERE'S NO GUESSING
ABOUT BEING A CHRISTIAN.

YOU'RE EITHER SAVED OR NOT.

ARE YOU BAPTIZED?

 I DON'T KNOW, MA'AM.

 WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

 WELL, I HADN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

IF I WAS BAPTIZED,
I WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER IT.

 MERCY.

WELL, YOU WILL ASK YOUR MAMA.

 THE THE FIRST THING
YOU SEE HER, YOU ASK HER

IF YOU'RE BAPTIZED.

YOUR SOUL IS IN
TERRIBLE DANGER, SON,

IF YOU'RE NOT.

DO YOU ATTEND CHURCH?

 NO, MA'AM.

THE CHURCH MY PEOPLE GO TO
DOESN'T HAVE A CONGREGATION

IN GLEN FLORA.

 WHAT CHURCH IS THAT?

 THE EPISCOPAL.

 I GUESS NOT.

THEY ONLY HAVE A SMALL ONE
IN HARRISON.

I AM A BAPTIST.

 YES, MA'AM.

 IF WE'D BAPTIZED YOU,
YOU WOULD'VE REMEMBERED.

 YES, MA'AM.

 I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE RIVER.

MADE CLEAN IN THE RIVER.

GAVE ALL MY SINS TO JESUS
IN THE RIVER.

WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB
IN THE RIVER.

( chuckles )
DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL

IN HARRISON?

 AS FAR AS THE SIXTH GRADE,
THEN I QUIT.

MY FATHER WAS AN EDUCATED MAN.

ALL HIS FAMILY WERE.

THERE WERE GREEK SCHOLARS
AND LATIN SCHOLARS.

DO YOU KNOW THE
HARRISON SPECTATOR?

 READ IT EVERY WEEK.

 MY UNCLES STARTED THAT.

ONE OF THEM NEVER WORKED
AT ALL, THEY SAID.

HE JUST SAT AROUND AND
READ BOOKS IN GREEK

ALL THE TIME.

MY MOTHER SAYS SHE'D RATHER
SEE ME DEAD THAN THAT WAY.

SHE SAID HE LIVED
A USELESS LIFE.

I LIKE TO READ, THOUGH.

I CAN'T HELP IT.

I DON'T TELL MY MOTHER.

 AND YOUR BIBLE,
DO YOU READ YOUR BIBLE?

 NO, MA'AM.

I DON'T HAVE A BIBLE.

 YOU DON'T HAVE A BIBLE?

 NO, MA'AM.

 DO YOU SAY YOUR PRAYERS
EVERY NIGHT?

 NO, MA'AM.

 WELL, THEN YOU START
PRAYING EVERY DAY...

ON YOUR KNEES
MORNING AND NIGHT.

YOU CAN HEAR MY PRAYERS
ALL OVER TOWN.

MR. COONS SAYS, "MRS. COONS,
YOU'RE PRAYING TOO LOUD.

YOU'RE KEEPING PEOPLE AWAKE
WITH YOUR PRAYERS."

"IT'LL DO THEM GOOD," I SAID.

"LET THEM HEAR THE PRAYERS
OF A TRUE CHRISTIAN."

AND THEN I JUST PRAY
THAT MUCH LOUDER.

SOMETIMES I EVEN SHOUT.

SHOUT THE DEVIL DOWN, I SAY.

YOU HAVE TO SHOUT LOUD
TO SHOUT THE DEVIL DOWN.

WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN A
LITTLE PRAYER NOW, SON?

 NO, MA'AM, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

I DON'T THINK SO.

 OH, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

NEVER BE ASHAMED TO LET PEOPLE
KNOW THAT YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN.

LORD, TAKE THIS BOY HERE...

WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

 HORACE.

 HORACE.

CLEANSE HORACE OF ALL
HIS WORLDLY WAYS.

OPEN HIS EYES TO
THE NEED OF BAPTISM.

 ( train whistle blows )
 ( bell ringing )

 â™ªâ™ª
 ( bell rings )

 ( knock at door )
 SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR, MAMA.

 CAN'T YOU OPEN
THE DOOR, HONEY?

 I'M SCARED TO, MAMA.

 ( sighs ) LILY DALE, HEAVENS!

 DORIS VIOLET SAYS THE CITY'S
ALIVE WITH BEGGARS AND GYPSIES

AND WHITE SLAVERS.

SHE SAYS HER MOTHER FORBID HER
EVER TO OPEN HER DOOR.

 WELL, I'M SURE THAT'S FINE
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE, HONEY.

BUT I DON'T THINK YOU
HAVE TO WORRY WHEN I'M

IN THE HOUSE.

 ( knocks )
 Corella: JUST A MINUTE.

( gasps ) HORACE.

LILY DALE, IT'S HORACE!

OH! OH!

( chuckles )
 HELLO, BROTHER.

WE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE GYPSIES.

MR. DAVENPORT'S IN ATLANTA
VISITING HIS KIN,

AND MAMA AND I ARE ALONE HERE.

MY GIRLFRIEND DORIS VIOLET
SAYS IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

FOR LADIES AND YOUNG GIRLS
TO BE LEFT ALONE

IN THIS WICKED CITY.

 YES, IT IS.

COME ON IN, SON.

 HOW DO YOU LIKE MY PIANO?

 IT'S VERY NICE.

 WHEN MAMA AND MR. DAVENPORT
FIRST GOT MARRIED,

HE GOT ME A SECONDHAND PIANO
STRAIGHT OFF, AND THEN

AFTER I LEARNED HOW
TO PLAY SOME, HE SAID

HE WOULDN'T HAVE ME
PLAYING A SECONDHAND PIANO,

AND HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT
THIS ONE FOR ME.

BROTHER, YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD ME PLAY THE PIANO,

HAVE YOU?

 NO.

 YOU WANT ME TO PLAY
SOMETHING FOR YOU NOW?

 HONEY, YOUR BROTHER
JUST GOT HERE.

HE'S TIRED.

JUST LET HIM REST
FOR A WHILE FIRST.

NOW, WHAT TIME DID YOU
GET UP THIS MORNING?

 FOUR.

 MR. DAVENPORT'S UP AT FOUR
EVERY MORNING.

EVEN ON SUNDAYS,
ISN'T HE, MAMA?

 YES, HE IS.

HORACE, YOU'VE GROWN INTO
A NICE-LOOKING YOUNG MAN.

 THANK YOU.

 HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN
ON STAYING, BROTHER?

 OH, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

YOU MENTIONED A WEEK
IN YOUR LETTER, AND I THOUGHT--

 NOW, IF I FIXED YOU
A SANDWICH, WOULD YOU EAT IT?

 SURE.

 AND I HAVE A CAKE I MADE
JUST THIS MORNING.

WOULD YOU LIKE A PIECE
OF THAT, TOO?

 YES, MA'AM.

 ( chuckles )
THIS IS A TWO-STORY HOUSE.

WE RENT ONE OF THE UPSTAIRS
BEDROOMS TO A QUIET COUPLE.

 DO YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED?

 YES, YOU HAVE.

 WOULD YOU HAVE RECOGNIZED ME
IF YOU'D PASSED ME

ON THE STREET?

 I THINK SO.

 I KEEP HAVING THIS TERRIBLE
DREAM THAT I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED

AND THEY WON'T LET ME GO
UNTIL I'M AN OLD WOMAN.

AND WHEN I COME BACK HOME,
NO ONE RECOGNIZES ME.

AND I KEEP SAYING,
"I'M LILY DALE.

I'M LILY DALE ROBEDAUX."

BUT NO ONE BELIEVES ME.

YOU EVER HAVE A DREAM LIKE THAT?

 NO.

 YOU EVER HAVE DREAMS?

 SOMETIMES.

ONCE I DREAMED...

I FORGET. ( chuckles )
 WE DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE

COMING WHEN YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MOTHER'S LETTER.

 I DIDN'T GET THE LETTER
RIGHT AWAY, AND WHEN

I DID GET IT, I JUST DECIDED
TO COME ON.

 HOW MUCH DID IT
COST YOU TO GET HERE?

 TWO DOLLARS.

 WHERE'D YOU GET
THE TWO DOLLARS?

 MAMA SENT IT TO ME.

 SHE DID?

 MAMA SAID SHE'D GIVE ME
THE MONEY TO COME BACK

ONCE I GOT HERE.

 ( man shouting )
 MAMA, THE VEGETABLE MAN'S

OUT FRONT.

 I HEAR HIM, HONEY.

 HOW MUCH LONGER WILL
MR. DAVENPORT BE GONE?

 HE WAS TO BE GONE
THREE WEEKS, BUT WE GOT

A LETTER FROM HIM YESTERDAY
AND HE SAID THINGS HAD

CHANGED SO IN ATLANTA
THAT IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HOME

ANY LONGER AND HE LONGED
TO GET BACK TO US.

SO HE'S CUTTING HIS TRIP SHORT.

WHEN MAMA GOT THE LETTER,
SHE SAID IT WAS A BLESSING

YOU HADN'T COME.

SHE WOULD'VE BEEN A NERVOUS
WRECK, HAVING YOU HERE AND

EXPECTING MR. DAVENPORT TO
WALK IN ANY MINUTE UNEXPECTED.

YOU SEE, SHE SENT FOR YOU
BEHIND HIS BACK.

SHE KIND OF HINTED AROUND FOR
HIS PERMISSION TO HAVE YOU HERE

WHILE HE WAS GONE, BUT HE SAID
HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

A GOOD IDEA TO ENCOURAGE YOU
TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK.

SO SHE DIDN'T PRESS IT FURTHER,
BUT THEN SHE DECIDED

TO WRITE YOU ANYWAY,
WHICH, AT THE TIME,

I THOUGHT WAS A MISTAKE.

I ALWAYS THINK DECEIT
IS A MISTAKE, DON'T YOU?

MAMA, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU SENT BROTHER TWO DOLLARS

FOR A TRAIN TICKET?

 WELL, THAT WAS
JUST MY SECRET, HONEY.

WE'VE ALL GOT TO HAVE
OUR SECRETS, DON'T WE?

 CAN I PLAY MY ETUDE
FOR YOU NOW, BROTHER?

 SURE.

 MR. DAVENPORT SAYS HE'D PAY
HIS LAST CENT TO PAY FOR

MY MUSIC LESSONS.

DO YOU HAVE
MUSICAL ABILITY, BROTHER?

 I DON'T KNOW.

 â™ªâ™ª
 HAVE YOU BEEN

TO HARRISON LATELY?

 I TRY TO GET IN EVERY WEEK.

I GET UP EARLY SUNDAY MORNING
AND WALK INTO HARRISON

ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS
AND HAVE SUNDAY DINNER WITH

AUNT VIRGIE OR AUNT INEZ
OR SOMETIMES AUNT GLADYS.

THEN I GET UP EARLY
MONDAY MORNING AND WALK BACK

TO GLEN FLORA TO GET
THE STORE OPEN.

 HOW LONG DOES IT
TAKE YOU TO WALK IT?

 THREE HOURS.

AUNT VIRGIE'S
TAUGHT ME TO DANCE.

 OH, SHE WOULD.

YOU CAN'T SPEND FIVE MINUTES
AROUND VIRGIE WITHOUT

SOME KIND OF DANCING GOING ON.

 WELL, I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
IF YOU ALL ARE GONNA TALK.

 I'M SORRY, SISTER.

 ( clears throat )
 â™ªâ™ª

 MAMA--
 SHH.

( whispering ) WE'LL TALK AFTER
LILY DALE IS FINISHED.

SHE'S VERY SENSITIVE.

 MAMA.

HE'S ASLEEP.

 SHH.

 I THINK THAT'S
VERY RUDE OF HIM.

 OH, HONEY, HE DOESN'T
MEAN TO BE RUDE.

I JUST DON'T THINK HE'S USED
TO HEARING MUSIC LIKE THIS.

AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S PROBABLY
JUST VERY TIRED FROM

HIS TRAIN RIDE.

 HOW LONG IS HE
PLANNING ON STAYING?

 I DON'T KNOW.

WHEN I FIRST INVITED HIM,
I ASKED HIM TO STAY A WEEK.

THAT WAS BEFORE I HEARD
FROM MR. DAVENPORT THAT HE

WAS CUTTING HIS TRIP SHORT.

 WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF
MR. DAVENPORT WALKED IN

RIGHT NOW?

 OH, I DON'T KNOW.

I JUST HOPE HORACE LEAVES
BEFORE MR. DAVENPORT GETS BACK.

I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE BACK
UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

WE JUST GOT
THE LETTER YESTERDAY.

IT TAKES TWO DAYS FROM ATLANTA.

 ( chickens clucking )
 BROTHER, HOW LONG

DO YOU PLAN TO STAY?

 I HAD PLANNED ON
STAYING A WEEK...

AND I THOUGHT WHILE I WAS HERE,
I MIGHT LOOK FOR A JOB.

 WHERE?

 IN HOUSTON.

 WHY?

 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE NICE
TO LIVE NEAR YOU AND MAMA

FOR A CHANGE.

 YOU COULDN'T LIVE
HERE, BROTHER.

THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR YOU HERE AT ALL.

 I DIDN'T MEAN HERE.

I MEANT IN HOUSTON SOMEWHERE,
BUT NEAR YOU.

 WELL, WHAT COULD YOU DO
IN HOUSTON, BROTHER?

 WELL, I THOUGHT I'D ASK
MR. DAVENPORT TO HELP ME FIND

A JOB AT THE RAILROAD.

 DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE LAYING
OFF PEOPLE DOWN AT THE RAIL YARD

EVERY DAY?

AND IF MR. DAVENPORT WASN'T
SUCH AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKER,

HE'D BE IN MORTAL DANGER
OF LOSING HIS JOB THERE.

 WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN AND SEE
A PLAY THIS AFTERNOON?

WOULD YOU LIKE THAT, HORACE?

 SURE.

 GOOD, I'LL GO GET DRESSED.

SON, I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I'M

AFRAID YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY
A WEEK AFTER ALL.

YOU SEE, MR. DAVENPORT--
 I ALREADY TOLD HIM

ABOUT MR. DAVENPORT.

ARE YOU GONNA GIVE BROTHER
MONEY FOR A TRAIN TICKET?

 YES, I AM.

 WHERE ARE YOU GETTING
ALL THIS MONEY FROM?

 THAT IS NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, LILY DALE.

ANYWAY, SON, I'M AFRAID YOU'LL
ONLY BE ABLE TO STAY TODAY

AND TOMORROW...

AT THIS TIME.

 YES, MA'AM.

 I'M AWFULLY SORRY.

 DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

 DO YOU HAVE
A SWEETHEART, BROTHER?

I HAVE ONE.

DON'T TELL MAMA
I TOLD YOU, THOUGH.

SHE'D HAVE A FIT.

HE'S A LOVELY BOY.

MR. DAVENPORT CAN'T STAND HIM.

HE WON'T EVEN LET HIM
COME TO THE HOUSE.

HE SAYS HE'S DISSOLUTE.

I HAVE TO SLIP OUT
EVEN TO SEE HIM.

MR. DAVENPORT FOUND OUT ABOUT IT
AND HE WAS IN FURY.

HE WOULDN'T EVEN SPEAK TO ME
UNTIL THE MORNING HE LEFT

FOR ATLANTA.

 THIS IS THE RING
MY BOYFRIEND GAVE ME.

HE WANTS TO MARRY ME.

HE SAYS I'M BEAUTIFUL.

HE SAYS I'M PRETTY ENOUGH
TO BE AN ACTRESS.

HE'S VERY HANDSOME, TOO.

HE DOES DRINK, THOUGH,
AND HE SMOKES CIGARETTES,

BUT I TOLD HIM HE'D HAVE TO
STOP BOTH BEFORE I MARRIED HIM.

I TOLD HIM I HAD A FATHER
WHO WAS A DRUNKARD

AND A CIGARETTE FIEND
AND THAT THOSE HABITS

HAD KILLED HIM.

DO YOU REMEMBER PAPA?

 SURE.

 I DON'T HAVE A PICTURE
OF HIM, DO YOU?

 NO.

 I WONDER IF ANYONE
HAS A PICTURE OF HIM.

I TELL YOU, I CAN HARDLY
REMEMBER WHAT HE

LOOKS LIKE ANYMORE.

I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE, THOUGH.

I CAN REMEMBER THE WAY HE
ALWAYS USED TO CALL ME SISTER

AND YOU BROTHER.

 HE NEVER CALLED YOU SISTER
OR ME BROTHER.

 YES, HE DID.

 NO, HE DIDN'T.

HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HORACE JR.
AND YOU LILY DALE.

 WELL, THEN,
WHO CALLED ME SISTER

AND WHO CALLED YOU BROTHER?

 I CALLED YOU SISTER,
AND YOU CALLED ME BROTHER,

BUT PAPA--
 WHAT'S THAT?

 THIS IS PAPA'S WATCH.

IT DOESN'T RUN.

I'LL HAVE IT FIXED SOMEDAY.

LOOK, IT HAD HIS INITIALS
ENGRAVED, SEE?

 WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

 I FOUND IT STUFFED IN
A DRAWER AT THE HOUSE

WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER
YOU ALL LEFT THAT TIME.

AND LOOK.

THIS IS MAMA'S WEDDING RING.

 HOW DO YOU KNOW?

 LOOK INSIDE.

IT SAYS "TO C.T. FROM H.R."

 YES, IT DOES.

 I USED TO HAVE SOME
OF PAPA'S BOOKS.

 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

 I DON'T KNOW.

THEY JUST DISAPPEARED AFTER
I WENT TO WORK OUT AT

THE GAUTIER PLANTATION.

I USED TO READ ALL THE TIME.

I READ NEWSPAPERS NOW MOSTLY.

 I CAN'T STAND READING.

MOTHER DOESN'T LIKE
TO READ EITHER.

MR. DAVENPORT SAYS HE'S NEVER
READ A BOOK IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE

AND HE DOESN'T INTEND TO.

AND ONCE WHEN MAMA TOLD HIM HOW
PAPA USED TO LIKE TO READ,

HE SAID, "NO WONDER HE DRANK."

LOOK, THIS IS MY SWEETHEART.

 ISN'T HE GOOD-LOOKING?

HE PLAYS BASEBALL
ON THE CITY TEAM.

HE'S A FIRST BASEMAN.

HE'S A WONDERFUL ATHLETE.

HE'S 25.

MR. DAVENPORT SAYS
HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY FATHER,

BUT I THINK A BOY SHOULD BE
QUITE A BIT OLDER THAN A GIRL,

DON'T YOU?

 OH, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

 ARE YOU READY?

 WHAT ARE WE GONNA SEE?

 I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M SURE
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

IT ALWAYS IS.

 ( people chattering )
 ISN'T THIS EXCITING, BROTHER?

I LIKE MUSIC BEST.

WE CAME TO HEAR GALLI-CURCI
WHEN SHE SANG HERE,

AND PADEREWSKI
AND JOHN McCORMACK.

 I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE HEARD HIM.

I LOVE IRISH TENORS.

I HEARD CHAUNCEY OLCOTT.

 COME ALONG, CHILDREN,
WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS.

 DID JOHN McCORMACK
SING
MOTHER MACHREE?

 YES, HE DID.

 SO DID CHAUNCEY OLCOTT
AS AN ENCORE.

 WE HAVE A RECORDING OF
JOHN McCORMACK SINGING,

DON'T WE, SISTER?

 YES, WE DO.

 CORELLA!

 LILY DALE!

 ( applause )
 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CARED

FOR THE PLAY, BROTHER.

 YES, I DID,
WHAT I COULD UNDERSTAND.

 HE'S PROBABLY NEVER SEEN
A PLAY BY SHAKESPEARE BEFORE,

PRECIOUS.

IT CAN BE HARD TO
UNDERSTAND AT FIRST.

 YOU FELL ASLEEP TWICE.

ONCE YOU WERE SNORING SO LOUD,
I HAD TO POKE YOU.

 MAMA, WHAT DID PAPA CALL ME?

DID HE CALL ME SISTER
OR DID HE CALL ME LILY DALE?

 I DON'T REMEMBER.

 WELL, I THINK HE CALLED ME
SISTER, BUT BROTHER SAYS

HE CALLED ME LILY DALE.

 HE DID CALL YOU LILY DALE.

I REMEMBER NOW.

 ALL OF THE TIME?

 I EXPECT SO.

HE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD ALL
BE CALLED BY OUR GIVEN NAMES.

 HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN
YOU MARRIED OUR FATHER?

 ( chuckles ) OH, 18.

I HAD HORACE WHEN I WAS 19.

 HOW OLD WAS OUR FATHER?

 TWENTY-TWO.

WE WERE ALL MOVING AROUND
SO MUCH AFTER THE WAR.

WE LIVED IN GOLIAD,
SALURIE ISLAND,

THEN BACK TO HARRISON.

WELL, MY PAPA WANTED
TO GET BACK HIS LAND

HE FELT HIS PAPA HAD
BEEN CHEATED OUT OF.

I THINK YOUR DADDY'S PEOPLE
WERE ALREADY THERE BY THEN.

I'M SURE THEY WERE.

HIS BROTHERS RAN THE NEWSPAPER.

HE HAD A LAW OFFICE.

HE WAS VERY HANDSOME.

VERY DISTINGUISHED.

HE WAS A YOUNG MAN.

 ( both gasp )
 DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

 ( both laugh )
 I DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE

OR WHAT YOU WANTED.

 I DON'T REMEMBER BEING SO
FRIGHTENED IN ALL MY LIFE.

WHEN'D YOU GET HERE?

 I'VE BEEN HERE TWO HOURS.

TOOK A NAP.

 WE GOT YOUR LETTER.

WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TILL TOMORROW.

I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

I LEARNED TWO NEW PIECES
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

I JUST--
 PETE, HORACE SURPRISED US

BY JUST WALKING IN HERE
THIS MORNING.

HE TOOK A DAY OFF FROM WORK
AND DECIDED TO PAY US A VISIT.

 HELLO, SIR.

 HELLO.

 DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

 I GUESS SO.

 HOW WERE YOUR PEOPLE?

 ALL RIGHT.

 Lily Dale: OOH, HE IS MAD.

I'VE ONLY SEEN HIM MAD ONCE.

I HOPE NEVER TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

 HORACE.

THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU
HERE NOW.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, HONEY?

I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT TRAIN
BACK TO HARRISON TONIGHT.

YOU GO TO VIRGIE.

YOU TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED.

SHE'LL JUST LET YOU STAY
WITH HER, OKAY?

 I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
FOR THE TICKET HOME.

 OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.

I'M SO SORRY.

I HAVE SOME MONEY
UPSTAIRS IN MY CLOSET.

I'LL GO GET IT.

NOW YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE.

 HOW ARE ALL OUR OLD FRIENDS
BACK IN HARRISON?

 ALL RIGHT.

WILLIE ROSEBERRY LEFT.

 MAMA JUST WENT TO GET HIM
SOME MONEY TO GET BACK HOME ON.

SHE SENT HIM TWO DOLLARS
TO GET HERE.

 YOU'RE GIVING HIM MONEY?

 WELL, YOU SEE,
MR. DAVENPORT...

 YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

AREN'T YOU ASHAMED TO TAKE MONEY
FROM YOUR MAMA?

WELL, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I WAS SUPPORTING MY MOTHER,

BROTHER, AND SISTERS
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

NOBODY EVER GAVE ME ANYTHING.

WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU GONNA MAKE,
TAKING MONEY FROM A WOMAN

AT YOUR AGE?

 HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT, SON.

HE'S NOT AS BAD AS HE SOUNDS.

LOOK, YOU TAKE THIS MONEY.

AND HERE'S A LITTLE EXTRA
FOR A SANDWICH ON THE TRAIN.

 MR. DAVENPORT, HE'S GONE.

LISTEN TO MY NEW PIECES.

 â™ªâ™ª
 PLEASE, LILY DALE,

JUST BE QUIET.

I HAVE A SPLITTING HEADACHE.

JUST BE QUIET FOR ONCE.

 PLAY THAT ETUDE I LIKE?

 ALL RIGHT.

I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
IF YOU'RE GONNA READ THE PAPER.

 I'M NOT GONNA READ THE PAPER.

 â™ªâ™ª
 ( knock at door )

 WHAT DO YOU WANT?

 I FORGOT MY SUITCASE.

 I BROUGHT SOME PRESENTS
FOR YOU ALL.

 OH, THANK YOU, SON.

ISN'T THAT PRETTY?

 THIS IS FOR YOU, LILY DALE.

IT'S A MEMORY BOOK.

IT'S FOR SCHOOL.

 OH, I HAVE ONE
OF THESE ALREADY.

ANYWAY, I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO SCHOOL IN FOUR YEARS.

MR. DAVENPORT SAYS
I GET TO STAY AT HOME

AND PRACTICE THE PIANO
AND COMPOSE MUSIC.

 SHE WROTE A RAG.

SHE CALLS IT
THE DAVENPORT RAG,

IN HONOR OF HER STEP DADDY.

 WELL, MR. DAVENPORT,
WHAT DID HORACE BRING YOU?

OH, ISN'T THAT NICE.

 WOULD BE IF I SMOKED.

 WELL, YOU CAN JUST GIVE IT
TO SOMEBODY DOWN AT

THE RAILROAD YARD.

 I SUSPECT I CAN.

 HORACE, WHEN YOU SEE VIRGIE
AND EVERYBODY ELSE, YOU TELL

THEM HI FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

 I WILL.

 THANK YOU, SON.

BYE AGAIN.

 BYE.

 MAMA, WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

TELL MR. DAVENPORT
ABOUT THE RAG I COMPOSED?

I WANTED TO SURPRISE HIM.

 I'M SORRY, HONEY.

 IT WAS TO BE HIS
CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

I WAS GONNA PLAY IT FOR HIM
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

 YOU CAN WRITE ME ANOTHER ONE
FOR CHRISTMAS, HONEY.

YOU CAN CALL THAT ONE
THE CHRISTMAS RAG.

JUST PLAY THIS ONE FOR ME NOW.

 ALL RIGHT.

 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
OUT THE WINDOW FOR?

 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING OUT
THE WINDOW FOR?

 WHAT?

 I SAID, WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?

 I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOUR BROTHER MADE

THE STREETCAR ALL RIGHT.

GO ON, PLAY.

 NO, I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
UNLESS EVERYBODY'S GONNA LISTEN.

 I'M LISTENING, HONEY.

 YOU'RE NOT LISTENING IF
YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.

 ALL RIGHT, NOW I'M LISTENING.

 â™ªâ™ª
 MAMA.

 YES?

 CAN I SEE WILL AGAIN?

 NO.

 WHY NOT, MAMA?

 NOW, YOU KNOW WHY NOT,
LILY DALE.

BECAUSE MR. DAVENPORT
DOES NOT APPROVE OF HIM.

 I LIKE HIM, MAMA.

 YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW
WHETHER YOU LIKE SOMEONE OR NOT.

 IF HE PROMISED TO STOP
DRINKING, COULD I SEE HIM THEN?

 NO, BECAUSE HE WON'T.

 YES, HE WOULD.

I KNOW HE WOULD.

 ( men singing )
 THAT'S WILL.

HE'S COME TO SERENADE ME.

 â™ª FAR OVER THE MOUNTAIN 
â™ª BREAKS THE DAY...

 ( singing continues )
 WHAT'S THAT?

 IT'S WILL KIDDER.

HE'S COME TO SERENADE
LILY DALE AGAIN.

 DOESN'T HE KNOW THERE ARE
WORKING PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE?

MR. AND MRS. WESTHEIMER
GO TO BED AT 8:00.

THEY WORK HARD ALL DAY LONG,
AND THEY'RE TIRED.

NOW YOU SEND HIM AWAY,
LILY DALE.

I FORBID YOU TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

I'VE TOLD YOU AND
TOLD YOU THAT.

 AND I'VE TOLD HIM
AND I TOLD HIM, MR. DAVENPORT,

BUT HE SAYS HE'LL JUST DIE
IF I NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO REFORM
AND NEVER DRINK AGAIN

AS LONG AS HE LIVES.

 I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

HE'D TELL YOU ANYTHING
JUST TO SEE YOU.

NOW YOU TELL HIM TO CLEAR ON OUT
OF HERE, OR I'M GOING TO.

I THINK HE'S CRAZY
COMING AROUND PEOPLE'S HOUSES

THIS TIME OF NIGHT
AND ACTING THAT WAY.

 ( crying )
 WHAT IS THE MATTER

WITH YOU, LILY DALE?

 ( continues crying )
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART!

THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!

YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART!

I LOVE HIM, AND HE LOVES ME!

 DON'T CRY.

JUST DON'T CRY.

 I CAN'T HELP IF
MY HEART IS BREAKING!

IT'S JUST BREAKING!

I'M SO UNHAPPY!

I'M SO MISERABLE!

 NOW, NOW, COME ON, LILY DALE.

IF YOU DON'T STOP CRYING,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE

TO HEAR THE SINGING.

 ( continues crying )
 DON'T CRY NOW, LILY DALE.

YOU WON'T HAVE TO SEND HIM AWAY.

JUST PLEASE DON'T CRY.

 WILL YOU SPEAK TO HIM?

 WHAT ABOUT?

 ABOUT--ABOUT HOW
HE'S GONNA REFORM

AND ABOUT HOW HE INTENDS
TO BEHAVE HIMSELF FROM NOW ON.

 WELL, ALL RIGHT, I GUESS SO.

 â™ª JUANITA 
 WILL?

WILL, COME ON INSIDE.

MR. DAVENPORT
WILL SPEAK TO YOU NOW.

 EVENING, FOLKS.

 HELLO, WILL.

 I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MIND
THE SERENADE.

 NO, IT'S VERY PRETTY.

JUANITA
 IS ONE
OF MY FAVORITE SONGS.

 LILY DALE SAYS YOU OBJECT
TO OUR SEEING EACH OTHER

BECAUSE OF MY HABITS.

 ( chuckles )
 WELL, DID LILY DALE TELL YOU

THAT I'M CHANGING MY HABITS?

I'VE STOPPED DRINKING.

 I THINK THAT'S
VERY WISE OF YOU, WILL.

YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

 NO, MA'AM, I KNOW THAT.

I NEVER DID DRINK
A WHOLE LOT ANYWAY.

 WHAT DO YOU CALL A WHOLE LOT?

I SAW YOU DRUNK THREE TIMES.

 THE ONLY THREE TIMES
IN MY LIFE I WAS EVER DRUNK.

I SAID TO LILY DALE,
"WOULDN'T YOU KNOW,

THE ONLY TIMES IN MY LIFE
I EVER GOT DRUNK,

I HAD TO MEET YOUR STEP DADDY?"
 SHE IS TOO YOUNG FOR YOU.

SHE'S 18 YEARS OLD.

AN 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL
HAS NO BUSINESS--

 I'M ALMOST 19, MR. DAVENPORT.

I'LL BE 19 ON MY NEXT BIRTHDAY.

 WELL...

WELL, IF YOU WANT TO COME
CALL ON HER HERE, ALL RIGHT.

BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SIT RIGHT HERE.

SHE CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE
WITH YOU TILL SHE'S 19.

IF I SO MUCH AS SMELL ONE DROP
OF LIQUOR ON YOUR BREATH,

YOU'LL NOT BE ALLOWED
BACK IN HERE EVER AGAIN.

 YES, SIR.

 ( giggles )
 NOW GO ON, SO WE CAN

GET TO BED AROUND HERE.

 ( giggles )
 THANK YOU.

YOU'RE THE SWEETEST MAN
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

YOU'VE MADE ME SO HAPPY
AND WILL SO HAPPY.

 ( clock chimes )
 ( knock at door )

 IT'S AWFUL LATE.

MR. DAVENPORT.

THERE'S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR.

 HORACE, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

 I TOOK THE WRONG STREETCAR.

BY THE TIME I GOT
TO THE RAILROAD STATION,

THE TRAIN WAS GONE.

THERE'S NO TRAIN TO HARRISON
UNTIL THE MORNING.

 I'M SO SORRY, SON.

DID YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. DAVENPORT?

 I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
DIFFERENT STREETCARS.

THE ONE I TOOK ENDED UP
IN THE HEIGHTS SOMEPLACE.

 BROTHER, WHY ARE
YOU TREMBLING?

ARE YOU SICK?

YOU LOOK SO PALE.

 ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SON?

 I DON'T FEEL WELL, MAMA.

 OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE BURNING UP.

YOU DON'T HAVE MALARIA, DO YOU?

YOU BEEN TAKING THAT QUININE?

 YES, MA'AM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

 ( gasps )
HORACE!

 ( gasps )
 MR. DAVENPORT!

MR. DAVENPORT, IT'S HORACE!

HE'S FAINTED!

HERE, HELP ME WITH HIM.

 HE'S GONNA DIE!

I KNOW HE'S GONNA DIE!

THAT'S JUST ANOTHER
OF MY TERRIBLE DREAMS.

I'M ALWAYS SEEING
BROTHER DEAD IN HIS COFFIN.

SOMETIMES HE'S BEEN IN
A TERRIBLE TRAIN WRECK.

SOMETIMES--
 LILY DALE, HUSH!

 HE'S NOT GONNA DIE.

 HE'S GOT A TERRIBLE FEVER.

FEEL HIS FOREHEAD.

HE'S BURNING UP.

 YES, HE DOES.

 OH, GOD, YOU SUPPOSE
HE HAS MALARIA?

IT'S JUST RIFE DOWN HOME.

 I DON'T KNOW A THING
ABOUT MALARIA.

I'M NOT FROM THE SWAMPS
OR THE BOTTOMS.

I'M FROM ATLANTA, REMEMBER?

THE FINEST CLIMATE
IN THE WORLD.

 WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF HE STAYS HERE TONIGHT?

 WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO?

JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T
LOSE HIS JOB TRAMPING

AROUND THE COUNTRY LIKE THIS.

 HE WAS GONNA QUIT HIS JOB.

HE SAID HE THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD FIND HIM A JOB

WORKING AT THE RAILROAD YARD.

 HE BETTER NOT
ASK ME FOR A JOB.

LET HIM FIND HIS OWN JOB.

NOBODY EVER GAVE ME A JOB.

I NEVER ASKED ANYBODY
FOR ANYTHING.

NOT ONE SOLITARY THING.

I HAVE TOO MUCH PRIDE
TO ASK HELP OF ANYONE.

I HAVE TOO MUCH PRIDE
TO ASK HELP OF ANYONE.

 â™ª THERE'S A SPARK 
â™ª IN MY HEART

â™ª WHICH NO COLLEEN MAY OWN 
â™ª THERE'S A DEPTH IN MY SOUL

â™ª NEVER SOUNDED OR KNOWN 
â™ª THERE'S A PLACE IN MY MEMORY

â™ª MY LIFE THAT YOU FILL 
â™ª NO OTHER CAN TAKE IT

â™ª NO ONE EVER WILL 
â™ª SURE I LOVE THE DEAR SILVER

â™ª THAT SHINES IN YOUR HAIR 
â™ª AND THE BROW

â™ª THAT'S ALL FURROWED 
â™ª AND WRINKLED WITH CARE

â™ª I KISS THE DEAR FINGERS 
â™ª SO TOIL-WORN FOR ME

â™ª OH GOD BLESS YOU 
â™ª AND KEEP YOU

â™ª MOTHER MACHREE 
 OH, HELLO, LILY DALE.

 HELLO. HOME FROM WORK?

 MM-HMM.

HOW IS YOUR BROTHER TODAY?

 I THINK HE'S ALL RIGHT.

HE'S BEEN SLEEPING ALL DAY LONG.

 WELL, THAT'S GOOD FOR HIM,
I'M SURE.

 LILY DALE, WOULD YOU MIND
FIXING YOUR OWN BREAKFAST

THIS MORNING?

I WANNA GET UPTOWN BEFORE
THE STORES GET TOO CROWDED.

 BUT WHAT IF BROTHER
GETS DELIRIOUS AGAIN?

 OH, HE WON'T, HONEY.

THE QUININE IS HAVING
ITS EFFECT.

THE FEVER'S DOWN.

HE JUST WANTS TO SLEEP NOW.

NOW, I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

 BYE.

â™ª SURE I LOVE THE DEAR SILVER 
â™ª THAT SHINES IN YOUR HAIR

â™ª AND THE BROW 
â™ª THAT'S ALL FURROWED

â™ª AND WRINKLED WITH CARE 
â™ª I KISS THE DEAR FINGERS

â™ª SO TOIL-WORN FOR ME 
â™ª OH

â™ª GOD BLESS YOU 
â™ª AND KEEP YOU

â™ª MOTHER MACHREE 
 BROTHER?

 YES.

 HOW DO YOU FEEL?

 BETTER.

 I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

WELCOME BACK TO THE LAND
OF THE LIVING.

 THANK YOU.

 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN A WHOLE WEEK YOU'VE

EVEN RESPONDED TO US AT ALL.

WE WERE SO AFRAID
FOR YOU, BROTHER.

WE THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA LOSE YOU.

 WAS I SICK?

 SICK?

I GUESS YOU WERE SICK.

AT THE POINT OF DEATH
FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS.

OUT OF YOUR HEAD
THE WHOLE TIME.

TALKING THE WILDEST
KIND OF NONSENSE.

YOU THOUGHT MR. DAVENPORT
HAD A BUTCHER KNIFE AND WAS

TRYING TO KILL YOU.

"HE'S TRYING TO SLIT MY THROAT!

PLEASE DON'T LET HIM
SLIT MY THROAT!"

I TELL YOU, IT WAS AWFUL.

THERE'S GOOD
COME FROM IT, THOUGH.

YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

THE NEXT NIGHT,
WILL CAME TO CALL

AND HE MADE HIMSELF SO HELPFUL
THAT MAMA AND MR. DAVENPORT

FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
AND HE'S BEEN INVITED OVER

EVERY NIGHT FOR SUPPER.

AND WHEN MR. DAVENPORT
FOUND OUT THAT WILL HAD

LOST HIS JOB, HE TOOK HIM
DOWN TO THE RAILROAD YARD

AND GOT HIM A JOB
WORKING THERE.

ISN'T THAT THRILLING?

 WHERE AM I?

 WHAT, BROTHER?

 WHERE AM I?

 WHERE ARE YOU?

HEAVENS, BROTHER.

DON'T SCARE ME THAT WAY.

YOU'RE IN HOUSTON.

DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

 HOW DID I GET HERE?

 HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

ON THE TRAIN.

 HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE?

 TWO WEEKS.

YOU'VE BEEN SICK
THE WHOLE TIME.

DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

I HAD TO GO TO MY GIRLFRIEND'S
TO PRACTICE MY MUSIC.

 HAVE I BEEN BAPTIZED?

 WHAT, HONEY?

 HAVE I BEEN BAPTIZED?

 BROTHER, I DON'T KNOW.

 HAVE YOU BEEN BAPTIZED?

 I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER.

WHAT MAKES YOU ASK
A QUESTION LIKE THAT

AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

 IS MAMA HERE?

 NO.

SHE WENT TO THE STORE.

SHE'S MAKING ME A BALL GOWN.

WILL'S TAKING ME TO
A DANCE NEXT WEEK.

WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MUSIC
TO CHEER YOU UP?

I'VE JUST GONE CRAZY OVER RAGS.

I WROTE
THE DAVENPORT RAG
FOR MR. DAVENPORT.

 â™ªâ™ª
 AND
THE WILLIE RAG
 FOR WILL.

 â™ªâ™ª
 AND NOW I'M WORKING ON

THE LILY RAG,
WHICH I'M DEDICATING

TO MYSELF.

 â™ªâ™ª
 HELLO.

 HE'S FEELING MUCH BETTER NOW.

 OH!

I'M SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT!

 HE DOESN'T REMEMBER A THING
THAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM, BUT HE'S

TALKING SOME SENSE NOW.

 WELL, LILY DALE, I HAD TO GO
TO FOUR STORES BEFORE I FOUND

THE RIGHT FABRIC AND PATTERN
FOR YOUR DRESS.

IT TOOK ME FOREVER!

NOW... ( chuckles )
YOU WANNA SEE WHAT I GOT?

 OF COURSE!

I CERTAINLY DO!

I AM SO EXCITED!

 I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

NOW...

THERE.

 OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL, BROTHER?

 YES.

 I'M SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

DID YOU GIVE HIM ANY
NOURISHMENT, LILY DALE?

 NO. HE JUST WOKE UP.

 WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME BROTH, SON?

I BET YOU WOULD.

I'M GONNA GET YOU SOME BROTH.

YOU'RE GONNA GET
THAT STRENGTH BACK.

 HAVE I BEEN BAPTIZED, MAMA?

 UH, WELL, NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

WHAT MADE YOU ASK ME
A QUESTION LIKE THAT?

 I MET THIS LADY.

SHE SAID I WAS IN MORTAL DANGER
IF I WASN'T BAPTIZED.

I THOUGHT FOR SURE
I WAS GONNA DIE.

I WAS GONNA DIE
WITHOUT BEING BAPTIZED.

 WELL, YOU DIDN'T DIE.

 WAS I BAPTIZED, MAMA?

 NO.

 HOW COME WE WEREN'T BAPTIZED?

 WELL...

EVERY TIME I STARTED TO GET
YOU BAPTIZED WHEN YOU WERE

A BABY, SOMETHING PREVENTED ME
FROM DOING IT.

I MEAN, I GOT SICK,
YOU GOT SICK, YOUR FATHER...

THEN ALL OUR
TROUBLES STARTED.

I JUST NEVER GOT
AROUND TO IT.

 WELL, LOOK WHO'S HOME.

 HOW DOES THE YOUNG MAN FEEL?

 I THINK HE'S GONNA LIVE NOW.

 HE'S STRONG AS AN OX.

DID YOU TELL HIM HOW I HAD
TO WRESTLE WITH HIM TO KEEP HIM

ON THAT BED?

HE THOUGHT THAT PETE HERE
WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM.

 HOW WAS WORK?

 FINE.

I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY DAY.

I THINK THEY LIKE ME, TOO.

DON'T THEY, PETE?

 OH, YES, THEY DO.

THEY SAID TODAY YOU'RE AS GOOD
A WORKER AS THEY'VE EVER SEEN.

 OH, LILY DALE,
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW WILL

THE FABRIC I GOT FOR YOUR DRESS?

 THAT IS MIGHTY GOOD-LOOKING.

I'M GONNA HAVE THE PRETTIEST
AND BEST-DRESSED GIRL

AT THE BALL.

 SEE IT, PETE?

ISN'T IT PRETTY?

 IT SURE IS.

 YOUNG MAN, YOU'D BETTER GET
WELL AND COME GO WITH US.

 I'M GOING BACK TOMORROW.

 NO, SON.

 NO, I'M GOING TO.

BUT FIRST I'M GONNA GET
DRESSED AND GET BAPTIZED.

I'M GONNA FIND ME A PREACHER.

I'M DIRTY, AND I WANNA BE
WASHED CLEAN.

 HE'S DELIRIOUS AGAIN.

 COME ON, FELLA.

 DON'T COME NEAR ME!

DON'T COME NEAR ME!

YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME
BEFORE I GET BAPTIZED!

 I THINK HE'S PUTTING ON
AN ACT JUST TO GET US

TO KEEP HIM HERE
SO HE CAN GET FREE ROOM

AND BOARD.

 WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT?

HE'S SICK,
AND YOU KNOW HE'S SICK.

YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF, PETE.

 DOES HE KNOW HE LOST
HIS JOB IN GLEN FLORA?

 HE DIDN'T LOSE HIS JOB,
JUST LAID OFF TEMPORARILY.

 WHAT ABOUT MY JOB?

 SHH, IT'S OKAY.

DON'T GET EXCITED.

JUST HUSH.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
ANOTHER TIME.

 WHAT ABOUT MY JOB, MAMA?

DON'T I HAVE MY JOB
IN GLEN FLORA?

 BROTHER, THERE'S BEEN A
TERRIBLE FIRE IN GLEN FLORA.

MR. GALBRAITH'S STORE
BURNED DOWN.

 OH, MY GOD.

 MR. GALBRAITH SENT WORD
HE IS GONNA REBUILD HIS STORE,

AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA GET
YOUR OLD JOB BACK THEN.

OKAY?

NOW YOU JUST REST, HONEY.

 THERE, TAKE THE DRESS
TO YOUR ROOM.

CAREFUL YOU DON'T WRINKLE IT.

 THANK YOU.

 Pete: WHERE'S LILY DALE?

 SHE'S UPSTAIRS IN HER ROOM,
GETTING DRESSED FOR THE DANCE.

 CALL ME WHEN
SHE'S ALL DRESSED.

 I WILL.

 WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO
ASK YOU HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

ONE LOOK AT YOU TELLS ME
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

 I AM, THANK YOU.

WHO BROUGHT ME THE PAPERS?

 WILL DID.

I ASKED HIM TO.

I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

 OH, YES, I LIKE THEM.

 HE ASKED ME WHAT YOU WANTED.

I SAID, "OH, ANYTHING
FROM OUT OF TOWN."

WHAT'D HE GET?

 NEW ORLEANS PICAYUNE,
ST. LOUIS STAR,

AND THE
GALVESTON NEWS.

GALVESTON NEWS?

THAT'S NOT VERY FAR AWAY.

 I KNOW, BUT I LIKE IT.

IT'S MY FAVORITE PAPER.

 IS THAT SO?

WELL, I DON'T KNOW ONE
FROM THE OTHER.

I NEVER READ THE PAPER.

IT'S MY EYES, I GUESS.

AT THE END OF THE DAY,
MY EYES ARE SO TIRED

FROM ALL THAT SEWING.

HORACE, DO YOU REMEMBER
MRS. CLINT HARRIS?

 NO, MA'AM.

 OH, SURE, YOU DO.

SHE'S KIN TO THE VAUGHNS.

WELL, MRS. VAUGHN, I GUESS.

YEAH, SHE AND I WERE
FRIENDS BACK IN HARRISON

BEFORE I LEFT TO MARRY
MR. DAVENPORT.

WELL, MYRTLE HARRIS LIVES
IN THAT HOUSE ACROSS

THE STREET--
THE ONE WITH THE BIG

STONE LIONS IN FRONT.

COST ALL KINDS OF MONEY,
THEY SAY.

SO WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,
SHE CAME CALLING ON ME

AND I NEVER RETURNED THE CALL
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS WORKING.

SO VIRGIE WRITES ME THAT
MYRTLE HARRIS GOES TO HARRISON.

AND SHE TELLS VIRGIE THAT
I HAD HURT HER FEELINGS

BECAUSE I HAD NEVER
RETURNED THE CALL.

SO VIRGIE SAYS, "OH,
I'M SURE IT'S BECAUSE

SHE'S ALWAYS WORKING."

"OH," SAYS MYRTLE.

"WHAT DOES SHE DO?"
"WELL," SAYS VIRGIE,

"SHE TAKES IN SEWING."

"OH, WELL, HEAVENS,"
SAYS MYRTLE HARRIS.

"OH, HEAVENS WHAT?"
SAYS VIRGIE.

"SHE'S JUST AS POOR AS YOU
WERE WHEN YOU LIVED HERE.

SHE JUST DIDN'T MARRY
A RICH HUSBAND."

( laughs )
VIRGIE SAID THAT SHUT HER UP.

WHY DO YOU LIKE THIS
GALVESTON PAPER SO MUCH?

 I DON'T KNOW.

I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
GALVESTON, YOU KNOW.

 NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

 OH, YEAH.

PAPA USED TO TALK
ABOUT IT SOMETIMES.

YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
GROWING UP THERE AS A BOY.

 OH, HONEY, HE DIDN'T
GROW UP THERE.

NO, HE WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD
WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER

AND HIS DADDY WAS KILLED.

AND HE AND HIS MAMA HAD TO
GO TO TYLER AND START

THAT BOARDINGHOUSE.

 MAMA, WILL KIDDER TELLS ME
THAT FOR 50 DOLLARS,

YOU CAN GO TO A BUSINESS SCHOOL
HERE IN HOUSTON.

I THINK I'M GONNA DO IT.

 WHERE WOULD YOU STAY?

 WELL--
 HONEY...

I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN
TO ASK YOU TO STAY HERE,

BUT I CAN'T.

YOU UNDERSTAND.

THERE'S NO ROOM.

WE MADE ROOM
WHILE YOU WERE SICK.

 I KNOW.

I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO STAY HERE.

 WELL, WHERE WOULD YOU GET
THE MONEY TO PAY FOR ALL THIS?

 I'LL TRY AND BORROW IT.

 I CAN'T HELP YOU, SON.

YOU UNDERSTAND.

 I WASN'T GONNA ASK YOU, MAMA.

 WELL, WHERE WOULD YOU
GET THE MONEY?

 I THOUGHT I'D ASK AUNT VIRGIE
OR TRY THE BANK.

 WELL, WHAT IF YOU
COULDN'T BORROW IT?

 THEN I CAN'T GO.

 WHY DO YOU WANNA STUDY
SO MUCH, SON?

 I DON'T WANNA CLERK IN 
A DRY GOODS STORE ALL MY LIFE.

I THOUGHT IF I HAD A
BUSINESS COURSE, I MIGHT HAVE

A FEW MORE OPPORTUNITIES.

 I SEE.

WELL...

I COULD DO THIS MUCH.

I COULD MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
A GOOD BREAKFAST EVERY DAY.

MR. DAVENPORT GOES
TO WORK ABOUT 5:00, 5:30.

AND IF YOU CAME HERE
ABOUT 6:00, 6:30,

I'LL MAKE SURE YOU HAD
A GOOD, HOT BREAKFAST.

YOU HAVE A GIRL, SON?

 I GO WITH SEVERAL.

 NO PARTICULAR ONE?

 I'VE BEEN SEEING QUITE A BIT
OF DOLLY PARKER.

SHE LIVES AT THE GARRETTS'.

THEY HAVE A PIANO,
AND THERE'S ALWAYS

LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE
OVER THERE.

ROSA GARRETT HAS A LOVELY VOICE.

 IS DOLLY PRETTY, HONEY?

 YES, MA'AM, SHE'S PRETTY.

 AND ROSA?

 WELL, ROSA HAS
A VERY NICE DISPOSITION.

AND LIKE I SAY,
HER MOTHER AND FATHER ARE ALWAYS

VERY KIND AND HOSPITABLE.

 THEY STILL AS POOR
AS CHURCH MICE?

 YES, MA'AM, I GUESS SO,
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A HAM

OR A CHICKEN OR A TURKEY
ON THE TABLE.

SOMETIMES THEY INVITE
AS MANY AS 12 OR 14 OF US

TO STAY FOR DINNER.

 I GUESS YOU'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED SOON,

WON'T YOU?

 I SUPPOSE SO.

 WELL, YOU BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT?

 MAMA, I CAN'T THINK
OF GETTING MARRIED.

I DON'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

 I THINK THAT'S VERY
SENSIBLE OF YOU.

I WISH I'D BEEN AS SENSIBLE AS
THAT WHEN I MARRIED YOUR FATHER.

I HOPE YOUR SISTER WILL BE.

OH. OH.

 HOW DO I LOOK?

 JUST BEAUTIFUL,
LIKE A PICTURE.

 HOW DO I LOOK, BROTHER?

 VERY PRETTY, SISTER.

 THANK YOU.

I FEEL PRETTY.

I THOUGHT THAT JUST NOW AS I
LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

NOT A GIRL AT THAT BALL,
I DON'T CARE HOW RICH THEY ARE,

WILL HAVE A DRESS
AS PRETTY AS MINE.

THANK YOU.

 OH, SUGAR.

 WHERE'S MR. DAVENPORT?

I WANT HIM TO SEE ME.

 WELL, HE'S OUT IN THE GARDEN.

I'LL GO GET HIM.

 LILY DALE'S ALL DRESSED NOW.

SHE WANTS YOU TO
COME IN AND SEE HER.

 I'M ALMOST DONE.

IF YOU COULD HOLD
THAT LANTERN UP,

I COULD SEE BETTER
WHAT I'M DOING.

 I WAS THINKING, LYING ON THE
COUCH HERE THIS AFTERNOON...

LILY DALE,
PAPA USED TO SING A SONG

TO THE TWO OF US
CALLED
LILY DALE.

DO YOU REMEMBER HOW IT WENT?

 NO, AND I DON'T WANT TO.

YOU ALWAYS WANNA
TALK ABOUT THE PAST.

THAT'S WHY I LOVE WILL.

HE ONLY WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHAT HE'S

GONNA DO WITH HIS LIFE,
HOW MUCH HE'S GONNA ACCOMPLISH.

WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WANNA
TALK ABOUT THE PAST?

WHAT PAPA DID OR DIDN'T DO?

I DON'T CARE WHAT HE CALLED ME.

ALL I KNOW IS HE SMOKED
CIGARETTES LIKE A FIEND

AND WAS A DRUNKARD
AND BROKE MY MOTHER'S HEART

AND DIED AND LEFT HER PENNILESS
TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD TO WORK

TO SUPPORT TWO CHILDREN.

 NO ONE'S SUPPORTED ME
SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.

 WELL, SHE SUPPORTED ME.

AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I WANNA TALK ABOUT,

EXCEPT MR. DAVENPORT, WHO'S BEEN
MORE TO ME THAN A REAL FATHER

COULD HAVE BEEN.

WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

WHY HAVE YOU TURNED
YOUR FACE AWAY?

BROTHER, ARE YOU GONNA LIE THERE
FOREVER ON THAT COUCH?

YOU SHOULD MAKE YOURSELF
GET DRESSED NOW EVERY DAY

AND START WALKING
AROUND THE BLOCK AT LEAST.

WHY ARE YOU SO SAD, BROTHER?

WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO SAD?

IT'S NOT FAIR.

TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT ME.

I CAN'T HELP IT IF I HAVE
A HAPPY DISPOSITION

AND YOU DON'T.

BROTHER, I WANNA BE CLOSE.

LET'S BE CLOSE, PLEASE.

WE'RE NOT CLOSE AS A
BROTHER AND SISTER SHOULD BE.

I SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME TO YOU
WITH MY TROUBLES,

AND I CAN'T.

 SISTER, I FEEL CLOSE TO YOU.

 DO YOU?

 YES.

 AND YOU'RE NOT JEALOUS OF ME?

 I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

I'VE NEVER BEEN JEALOUS OF YOU
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

 I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE JEALOUS OF ME
BECAUSE MR. DAVENPORT SPOILS ME

AND PREFERS ME TO YOU,
BUT THAT'S ONLY NATURAL,

BROTHER, THAT HE WOULD.

YOU'RE A STRANGER TO HIM,
REALLY, AND I WAS RAISED UP HERE

IN THE HOUSE WITH HIM.

HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SO SWEET
AND CONSIDERATE TO ME, BROTHER.

I REMEMBER WHEN MAMA
DECIDED TO MARRY HIM.

HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS, AND HE
TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA BE

A DADDY TO ME.

AND HE HAS.

HE CERTAINLY HAS.

YOU MUST LOVE HIM FOR THAT.

SAY YOU DO.

 I CAN'T STAND HIM.

 DON'T SAY THAT.

 DO YOU THINK I'M FAKING
LYING HERE ON THIS COUCH?

DO YOU THINK I DON'T CHOKE ON
EVERY PIECE OF HIS FOOD

THAT I EAT?

HOW CAN I GET WELL EATING
THE FOOD OF A MAN...

I DESPISE?

 BROTHER, BROTHER, STOP IT.

 I DESPISE HIM.

I WOULD NEVER HAVE COME HERE
IF I WOULD'VE THOUGHT

HE WOULD COME HERE
AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN SICK

AND BEEN AT HIS MERCY!

 STOP IT.

 I DESPISE HIM!

I DESPISE HIM!

IF I HAD THE STRENGTH,
I WOULD GET UP AND WALK ACROSS

THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW--
 NOW YOU'VE SPOILED IT FOR ME.

 RIGHT NOW.

 TELL LILY DALE
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

 ALL RIGHT.

 HORACE!

HORACE!

HORACE!

LILY DALE!

LILY DALE!

LILY DALE, GET MR. DAVENPORT,
QUICK, OUT IN THE YARD.

YOUR BROTHER HAS FALLEN,
AND HE'S HURT! HURRY!

AND GET THOSE SMELLING SALTS!

 PETE, MAMA NEEDS YOU.

BROTHER'S FAINTED AGAIN.

 WHAT?

 WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW?

 I DON'T KNOW.

I CAME IN AND JUST FOUND HIM
ON THE FLOOR.

HERE.

 I DESPISE HIM.

 WHAT?

 I DESPISE HIM.

 HE'S DELIRIOUS.

 I DESPISE HIM.

 YOU DELIRIOUS, BOY?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, SON?

 PETE. MR. DAVENPORT.

HE SAYS HE HATES
AND DESPISES HIM.

 SHH, DON'T SAY THAT.

HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT. NEVER.

DON'T REPEAT SOMETHING
SOMEONE SAYS WHEN THEY'RE

OUT OF THEIR MIND.

 HE WAS NOT OUT OF HIS MIND.

HE'S RUINED THIS NIGHT FOR ME
BY HIS HATE!

 YOU WERE OUT OF YOUR HEAD,
WEREN'T YOU, HONEY?

DON'T RUIN THIS EVENING
FOR HER.

SHE'S HAD SO LITTLE
HAPPINESS IN HER LIFE.

 ( knock at door )
 HELLO THERE, YOUNG LADY.

HOW DO YOU FEEL?

 WILL, COME ON AND HELP ME.

HORACE HAS FALLEN.

I NEED TO GET HIM
BACK ON THE COUCH.

COME ON.

 COME ON, BOY.

COME ON.

WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

 THERE. THERE. THERE.

NOW...

YOU FEELING BETTER, HONEY?

 YES, MA'AM.

 YOU GAVE US QUITE A SCARE.

YOU WERE DELIRIOUS.

YOU KEPT LOOKING AT MR.DAVENPORT
AND SAYING HOW YOU DESPISED HIM.

BUT HE KNEW YOU WERE DELIRIOUS
AND DIDN'T MEAN A WORD OF IT.

( sighs )
 WHERE'S MY GIRL?

I THOUGHT SHE'D BE
ALL DRESSED AND WAITING.

 WELL, SHE WAS,
BUT HER BROTHER FELL DOWN

AND SHE GOT ALL NERVOUS
AND UPSET AND JUST RAN

OUT OF THE ROOM.

I'LL GO GET HER.

 DID LILY DALE TELL YOU
ABOUT MY NEW JOB?

I'M LEAVING THE RAILROAD.

I'M GOING INTO THE
PRODUCE BUSINESS.

GREAT NEW COMPANY
THAT'S JUST STARTED UP.

THEY GOT THE RIGHTS TO HANDLE
SOME GREAT NEW PRODUCTS

HERE IN THIS AREA.

ADMIRATION COFFEE...

THAT'S THE ONE THEY
ADVERTISE AS "THE CUP

OF SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY."

AND, UH...

HEY, SAY, YOU NEED A JOB.

SPEAK TO PETE ABOUT GETTING
MY JOB FOR YOU OUT AT

THE RAILROADS.

ANYONE CAN DO IT.

 LILY DALE WILL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

 PLENTY OF TIME, PETE.

PLENTY OF TIME.

SAY, I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA.

WHAT ABOUT HORACE FOR MY JOB
AT THE YARDS?

 NO, IT WAS ALREADY TAKEN.

IT WAS FILLED THIS AFTERNOON.

 OH, WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

WE JUST WEREN'T ON THE BALL,
WERE WE, PETE?

WHY DIDN'T WE THINK
ABOUT IT SOONER?

SAY, LOOK HERE.

THIS SIGHT WAS
WORTH WAITING FOR.

MY, MY.

YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

 THANK YOU, WILL.

MAMA MADE THE DRESS.

 AND IT IS SOMETHING.

YES, IT IS.

DOESN'T SHE LOOK GORGEOUS, PETE?

 YES, SHE DOES.

 SHOOT, SHE'LL BE THE
PRETTIEST GIRL THERE,

I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
YOUR SISTER, HORACE?

PUT A WALTZ ON
THE VICTROLA, PETE.

LILY DALE AND I WILL SHOW YOU
THE TEXAS CASTLES--

IRENE AND VERNON.

 I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT, WILL.

I HAVE A HEADACHE.

 A HEADACHE?

WELL, GET OVER IT.

NO HEADACHES ARE ALLOWED
ON THIS NIGHT.

WE'RE GONNA DANCE ALL NIGHT.

 â™ªâ™ª
 HOW IS THAT?

 YOU DO MAKE
A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE.

AND YOU'RE BOTH
WONDERFUL DANCERS.

NOW, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
BRING HER HOME?

 DON'T WAIT UP FOR US.

 OH, I ALWAYS DO.

I DON'T SHUT MY EYES
UNTIL SHE'S HOME.

 DON'T YOU TRUST ME, LADY?

DON'T YOU TRUST ME TO
TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAUGHTER?

 I TRUST YOU, WILL.

YOU KNOW THAT.

 THEN YOU GO TO SLEEP.

 NO, I DON'T SHUT MY EYES
UNTIL SHE'S IN THE HOUSE.

 WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN SHE'S MARRIED AND

NOT LIVING HERE ANYMORE?

 THEN I CAN'T HELP IT.

SHE'S SOMEONE ELSE'S
RESPONSIBILITY.

 WHAT IF WE'RE OUT UNTIL DAWN?

 THEN I WON'T SLEEP
UNTIL DAWN.

YOU'RE TEASING ABOUT DAWN.

YOU'LL BRING HER HOME BY 12:00.

 OR ONE.

 TWELVE.

 ALL RIGHT, 12:30.

LET'S GO, PRINCESS.

 NOW, HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME,
BOTH OF YOU.

THERE.

 THANK YOU, MAMA.

 GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

 GOOD NIGHT, PETE.

 GOOD NIGHT, HON.

 GOOD NIGHT, PETE.

DON'T TAKE ANY WOODEN NICKELS.

 I'LL TRY NOT TO.

TAKE CARE OF HER.

 I WILL.

 GOOD NIGHT, LILY DALE.

 GOOD NIGHT, YOUNG MAN.

YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

 SHE SURE LOOKED PRETTY,
DIDN'T SHE?

 YES.

 ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

 YES.

 I TOLD MR. DAVENPORT
THAT WHATEVER YOU SAID TO HIM

JUST NOW, YOU WERE DELIRIOUS.

 I WASN'T DELIRIOUS, MAMA.

I KNEW WHAT I WAS SAYING.

I'M LEAVING HERE
TOMORROW, MAMA.

 HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

YOU CAN'T EVEN GET
YOURSELF ACROSS THE FLOOR.

 I'M GOING IF I HAVE
TO CRAWL OUT OF HERE.

I'M GONNA ASK WILL TO COME
AND HELP ME OUT OF HERE,

RIDE TO HARRISON WITH ME
ON THE TRAIN,

OR I'LL MAKE IT MYSELF.

 I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THAT NOW.

 I'M GOING, MAMA.

NOTHING WILL KEEP ME HERE.

NOTHING.

 WHERE WILL YOU GO?

YOU HAVEN'T GOT A JOB.

WHAT WILL YOU DO?

 I'LL GO TO AUNT VIRGIE.

SHE'LL NURSE ME.

 I WANNA NURSE YOU.

I WANNA DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

PLEASE LET ME.

 WELL...

ANYWAY, IF YOU DECIDE TO
COME BACK AND STUDY AT

THAT BUSINESS COURSE,
I HOPE YOU'LL REMEMBER

TO COME OVER HERE
AND HAVE A GOOD BREAKFAST

IN THE MORNING.

WELL, HONEY, YOU'RE TIRED.

I'LL JUST LET YOU REST.

 MAMA.

 YES, SON.

 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SONG
CALLED
LILY DALE?

THE ONE PAPA
ALWAYS SANG TO SISTER?

 WELL, LET'S SEE NOW.

I SEEM TO REMEMBER HIM
SINGING IT, BUT I CAN'T

REMEMBER HOW IT GOES.

 TRY TO REMEMBER IT, MAMA.

 WHY, HONEY?

WHY?

 BECAUSE I WANNA REMEMBER IT.

 ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY.

I'LL CERTAINLY TRY.

RIGHT NOW?

 YES.

 I JUST CAN'T.

BUT I'LL KEEP ON TRYING.

 ( indistinct chatter )
 NO.

 ARE YOU GONNA TELL YOUR MAMA
WHAT THAT REPORTER

FROM THE PAPER SAID TO YOU?

 I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HE SAID.

WHAT DID HE SAY?

 YOU DON'T?

I THINK HE SAID YOU WERE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DANCER

AT THE WHOLE DANCE.

 I THINK HE SAID I WAS
THE MOST GRACEFUL DANCER

HE'D EVER SEEN.

 I THOUGHT YOU
FORGOT WHAT HE SAID.

DIDN'T I TELL YOU I'D
HAVE HER HOME BY 12:30?

 SHH, SHH, SHH.

 DID YOU HAVE A GOOD EVENING?

 WONDERFUL EVENING.

 SHOW HER YOUR PRESENT.

 OH, MY GOODNESS.

 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

 WELL...

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

 WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COST ME?

 I HAVE NO IDEA.

 PLENTY.

BUT I THOUGHT NOTHING IS
TOO MUCH FOR MY SWEETHEART.

 WHAT DOES IT MEAN, WILL?

 IT MEANS WE'RE ENGAGED.

I'VE ASKED HER TO MARRY ME.

 ( crying )
 ( sniffles )

DARLING...

YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO GET MARRIED.

WILL, PLEASE BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S TOO YOUNG.

I HAVE NOTHING,
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

IN THE WORLD AGAINST YOU.

YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT.

 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

WE'RE NOT GETTING
MARRIED TOMORROW.

I HAVE SOME SENSE, YOU KNOW.

I'M MAKING MY PLANS.

I'M GONNA WORK HARD FOR
A YEAR, SAVE MY MONEY...

AND WHEN I HAVE
A FEW THOUSAND IN THE BANK,

THEN WE'LL MARRY.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS
TO THAT PLAN?

 WELL, I GUESS NOT.

BUT YOU'LL PROMISE ME
YOU'LL WAIT A YEAR, WON'T YOU?

 I'M NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES.

I MIGHT WANNA BE
MARRIED TOMORROW.

 OH, WILL, PLEASE BE SERIOUS.

 OH, I'M SERIOUS.

WE'LL WAIT AS LONG AS YOU
WANT US TO, WON'T WE, HONEY?

 ( crying )
 LILY DALE.

 SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

SHE'S BEEN A LITTLE UPSET
ALL EVENING.

I THINK HIS BEING HERE
GETS HER UPSET.

SHE SAID HE TALKED MEAN
TO HER TONIGHT.

 OH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ALL WENT ON.

HE'S UPSET, TOO.

HE TOLD ME.

HE WANTS YOU TO TAKE HIM
TO THE STATION TOMORROW.

HE WANTS TO GO HOME.

I JUST DON'T THINK HE'S
STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT

ON HIS OWN, BUT HE'S
DETERMINED TO GO.

 I'M SORRY, WILL.

I BET YOU THINK I'M CRAZY.

 NO, I DON'T.

I JUST THINK YOU'RE
SWEET AND PRETTY.

CAN I KISS HER GOOD NIGHT?

WE'RE ENGAGED.

 ( sighs )
ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT.

 GOOD NIGHT.

 GOOD NIGHT, WILL.

 GOOD NIGHT, MISS CORELLA.

 GOOD NIGHT, WILL.

 ( door shuts )
 ( sighs )

WELL...

HE'S A GOOD BOY.

I'M VERY PLEASED FOR YOU.

NOW...

WE BETTER GET TO BED.

 MAMA.

 MM-HMM.

 WHAT DO THEY DO TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED TO...

MAKE YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

 OH, DON'T ASK ME SUCH
QUESTIONS THIS TIME OF NIGHT,

LILY DALE. HEAVENS.

 LAVINIA SAYS YOUR HUSBAND
DOES TERRIBLE THINGS TO YOU.

DOES HE?

 IT'S NOT SO TERRIBLE.

 WHAT IS IT?

 UH, IT'S JUST...

WHAT A HUSBAND DOES TO A WIFE
WHEN THEY'RE MARRIED,

THAT'S ALL.

WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT.

 WHEN?

 WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED.

 DOES IT HURT?

 I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE
SAY THAT IT HURTS,

BUT IT NEVER HURT ME.

 DOES IT HURT
TO HAVE CHILDREN?

 YES, AND I PRAY TO GOD YOU
NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT.

 WILL WANTS TO HAVE CHILDREN.

 WELL, THEN HE IS A FOOL,
AND DON'T YOU EVER LET HIM

TALK YOU INTO IT.

 WOMEN DIE IN CHILDBIRTH,
DON'T THEY?

 ALL THE TIME.

EVERY MINUTE OF THE HOUR.

WHEN I HAD YOU AND YOUR BROTHER,
I PRAYED TO GOD

THAT I WOULD DIE.

 WHY?

 BECAUSE IT HURT SO MUCH.

I WAS IN TERROR
THE ENTIRE TIME.

 IS THE DANCE OVER?

 OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

WE WOKE YOU UP.

GO BACK TO SLEEP.

 HOW WAS THE DANCE, LILY DALE?

 IT WAS VERY NICE.

 LILY DALE IS ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED.

SHOW YOUR BROTHER YOUR RING.

 IT COST $125.

 HOW DO YOU KNOW?

 WILL TOLD ME.

HE PAID CASH FOR IT.

 YOU KNOW, PAPA DID SING
LILY DALE
 TO YOU WHEN

YOU WERE A GIRL.

AND YOU GOT YOUR NAME
FROM THAT SONG.

MAMA TOLD ME.

 WELL, I DON'T CARE
WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT OR NOT,

IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING
TO ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

 AND, MAMA, I REMEMBERED
HOW THE SONG GOES.

( humming )
 YEAH, THAT'S IT.

THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

 YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN IT AND
TEACH IT TO YOUR CHILDREN,

LILY DALE.

 I'M NOT GONNA HAVE CHILDREN.

 YOU'RE NOT?

 NO!

 WHY?

 BECAUSE.

ANYWAY, IF I DID HAVE CHILDREN,
I WOULDN'T SING THEM THAT SONG.

 WHY?

 BECAUSE I WANNA FORGET
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

BACK THEN.

EVERYTHING.

AND I WANT YOU TO QUIT
TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT.

EVERY TIME I FEEL THE LEAST
BIT GOOD, YOU BEGIN ON ALL THAT.

"WHAT DID PAPA CALL US?

WHAT DID HE SING?

DID PAPA DO THIS?

DID PAPA DO THAT?"
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM.

HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT?

I DON'T CARE IF I EVER
HEAR HIS NAME AGAIN.

MR. DAVENPORT IS MY FATHER.

HE'S THE ONLY ONE I WANT.

YOU HAVE NO FATHER,
BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT!

I HAVE ONE, THE ONLY ONE I WANT!

 SHE DOESN'T MEAN THAT, SON.

YOU KNOW...

SHE'S JUST ALL EXCITED
ABOUT THE DANCE

AND GETTING ENGAGED
AND EVERYTHING.

 I DON'T CARE, MAMA,
IF THAT'S HOW SHE FEELS.

 HORACE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT

YOUR PAPA.

MR. DAVENPORT
IS VERY SENSITIVE.

I DON'T THINK HE LIKES IT MUCH.

 I DON'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT MY FATHER.

I WOULDN'T, THANK YOU.

 LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

MAMA DIDN'T LOVE OUR PAPA.

SHE LOVES MR. DAVENPORT BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN GOOD TO HER AND TO ME.

SO DON'T LET ME EVER HEAR YOU
SAY ANOTHER WORD AGAINST HIM.

BECAUSE IF YOU DO, I'LL TELL HIM
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID AND

HE'LL THROW YOU OUT OF THIS
HOUSE AND NEVER LET

YOU IN HERE AGAIN
TO UPSET ME AND MAMA!

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER!

 HE'LL NEVER GET THE CHANCE
TO THROW ME OUT.

 HORACE.

 I'M GETTING ON MY CLOTHES
AND I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

 YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

 YES, I CAN.

AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE IF I HAVE
TO CRAWL OUT OF HERE ON MY HANDS

AND ON MY KNEES.

 HORACE!

 OH, BROTHER!

I'M SO SORRY, BROTHER.

I DIDN'T MEAN A WORD OF
THE TERRIBLE THINGS I SAID.

NOT A ONE.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT GETS
INTO ME SOMETIMES, BROTHER.

I HAVE A TERRIBLE DISPOSITION.

TERRIBLE DISPOSITION.

IT'S THE ROBEDAUX
COMING OUT IN ME.

BROTHER...

PLEASE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

PLEASE.

PLEASE.

I LOVED PAPA.

BELIEVE ME, I DID,
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DID,

BUT IT HURTS ME SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT HIM,

AND IT SCARES ME, TOO.

YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT SCARES ME.

SOMETIMES AT NIGHT...

( crying )
I CAN HEAR PAPA COUGHING

AND STRUGGLING TO BREATHE
LIKE HE USED TO.

AND I DIDN'T MEAN WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOU LEAVING.

I WANT YOU TO STAY
UNTIL YOU'RE ALL WELL

AND STRONG AGAIN, BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONLY BROTHER I HAVE.

SOMETIMES AT NIGHT,
I THINK I CAN SEE YOU DEAD

AND IN YOUR COFFIN.

AND I CRY IN MY DREAMS
LIKE MY HEART WILL BREAK.

AND I'M REALLY CRYING, TOO,
BECAUSE MY CRYING WAKES ME UP,

AND I SAY TO MYSELF,
"BROTHER'S ALIVE.

HE'S NOT DEAD AT ALL.

IT'S JUST A DREAM."

BUT STILL, I JUST
FEEL SO MISERABLE.

I JUST LIE THERE SOBBING
LIKE MY HEART WILL BREAK.

AND SOMETIMES MAMA HEARS ME
AND SHE COMES IN AND SHE SAYS,

"LILY DALE, WHY ARE YOU CRYING?"
AND I SAY, "BECAUSE I DREAMT

AGAIN THAT BROTHER HAD DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN AND LEFT US."

 SHH, LILY DALE.

LILY DALE, NOW COME ON, HONEY.

I KNOW THAT YOUR BROTHER
FORGIVES YOU.

HE'S JUST FEELING WEAK
RIGHT NOW.

HE'S VERY WEAK.

HE CAN'T TALK MUCH RIGHT NOW.

HORACE. HORACE.

WE JUST BETTER GET
MR. DAVENPORT.

 DON'T YOU CALL HIM.

I DON'T WANT HIM TO HELP ME.

I DON'T WANT HIM NEAR ME.

I DON'T WANT HIM TO TOUCH ME.

I'LL GET BACK ON THE COUCH
BY MYSELF.

 WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON OUT HERE?

 IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MR. DAVENPORT.

HORACE JUST FELL AGAIN,
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT.

 WHAT TIME IS IT?

 IT'S 1:00 OR AFTER.

 GET TO BED.

MY GOD!

I HAVE TO BE UP AT 5:00,
YOU KNOW.

I HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING!

 GO GET YOUR REST NOW.

 HERE. HERE YOU GO.

 I DESPISE HIM.

 SHH. SHH.

 MAMA.

 SHH.

IT'S OKAY.

IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

IT'S OKAY.

 MAMA.

 SHH. SHH.

 ( singing )
 ( crying )

 ( continues singing )
 â™ªâ™ª

 WILL!

BEHAVE YOURSELF.

MAMA AND BROTHER JUST WENT
FOR A SHORT WALK.

NOW SIT DOWN
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.

WILL...

 I'M NOT LEAVING YOUR SIDE
UNTIL YOU PROMISE TO MARRY ME.

 I PROMISE TO MARRY YOU...

A YEAR FROM NOW.

 I DON'T WANNA WAIT A YEAR.

 WILL, YOU PROMISED MAMA
YOU WOULD.

WHY ARE YOU GOING BACK
ON YOUR WORD?

WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

QUIT LOOKING AT ME THAT WAY.

YOU MAKE ME VERY NERVOUS.

GO SIT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR
OVER THERE, OR I'M GONNA

GO FIND MAMA AND I'M GONNA
TELL HER THAT YOU'RE NOT

BEHAVING LIKE A GENTLEMAN.

 IS THIS HOW
A GENTLEMAN BEHAVES?

 YES.

THANK YOU.

 â™ªâ™ª
 LILY DALE.

 WHAT?

 SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.

 NOTHING'S WRONG WITH ME.

JUST BE QUIET
AND LET ME PRACTICE.

 â™ªâ™ª
 LILY DALE.

 WHAT?

 SOMETHING IS TROUBLING YOU.

 OH, I DON'T KNOW, WILL.

I'M JUST VERY NERVOUS.

I THINK IT'S BROTHER BEING HERE.

 IT'LL SOON BE OVER.

HE'S LEAVING TOMORROW.

 I MUST SAY,
IT WILL BE A RELIEF TO HAVE THE

HOUSE BACK TO OURSELVES AGAIN.

BROTHER JUST DOESN'T FIT IN.

WE ALL TRIED,
BUT HE JUST DOESN'T FIT IN.

NOW, YOU FIT IN.

ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

YOU'RE HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES,
AND YOU CHEER EVERYBODY UP

AND MR. DAVENPORT STARTS TO TALK
LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING AGAIN.

BUT ONCE YOU LEAVE, WELL...

SILENT AND GLOOMY AND UNHAPPY.

 HORACE, HOW YOU FEELING?

YOU WANNA GO BACK NOW?

 YES, MA'AM.

 COME ON, HONEY.

 I HAD A DREAM ABOUT
BROTHER AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

I DREAMT HE WAS DEAD.

ONLY THIS TIME, I DIDN'T CRY.

I SAID A TERRIBLE THING.

I SAID, "IT'S ABOUT TIME."

MAMA SAID,
"WE'LL BURY HIM HERE,

IN THE FAMILY PLOT IN HOUSTON."

"NO, WE WON'T," I SAID.

"I WON'T HAVE HIM BURIED NEXT TO
YOU AND MR. DAVENPORT AND ME.

I WANT HIM BURIED WITH
HIS FATHER, WHERE HE BELONGS."

ISN'T IT A TERRIBLE THING
FOR A SISTER TO HAVE A DREAM

LIKE THAT ABOUT A BROTHER?

 PROBABLY ATE SOMETHING
THAT DIDN'T AGREE WITH YOU.

 WILL?

 WHAT?

 LOOK AWAY.

I WANNA ASK YOU SOMETHING.

 WHERE SHOULD I LOOK?

 ANYWHERE AWAY FROM ME.

 I DON'T WANNA GET MARRIED.

 WHY?

 DON'T LOOK AT ME, PLEASE.

 WHY?

 BECAUSE YOU'LL HURT ME
IF YOU DO.

 HOW'LL I HURT YOU?

 YOU KNOW...

 OH.

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'LL HURT YOU?

WHO TOLD YOU I WOULD?

 SISSY DOUGLAS.

 SHE'S A FOOL.

 I ASKED MAMA ABOUT IT, TOO.

 WHAT DID SHE SAY?

 SHE SAID...

WELL, SHE DIDN'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

SHE SAID PAPA DIDN'T HURT HER,
BUT SOME WOMEN TOLD HER

THAT THEY WERE HURT
BY THEIR HUSBANDS.

 I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

 HOW DO YOU KNOW?

 I JUST DO!

OH, LILY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

 I'M SCARED, WILL.

I WANNA MARRY YOU,
BUT I'M SCARED TO.

 NOW I TOLD YOU--
 I'M SCARED I'M

GONNA HAVE A BABY.

I KNOW IT HURTS WHEN YOU DO.

I'M GONNA DIE WHILE
I'M HAVING HIM.

MAMA SAYS IT'S THE WORST PAIN
IN THE WORLD.

 DON'T YOU WANNA
HAVE CHILDREN?

 I DO, BUT I'M SCARED TO.

I'M SCARED OF THE TERRIBLE PAIN,
THAT I MIGHT DIE.

 WE DON'T HAVE
TO HAVE THEM THEN.

 YOU MEAN, YOU CAN BE MARRIED
AND NOT HAVE CHILDREN?

 YES.

 HOW?

 THERE ARE WAYS.

PETE AND YOUR MAMA,
THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR

10 YEARS, THEY HAVE NO CHILDREN.

 YOU'RE SAYING THAT
PETE AND MAMA--

 HONEY, THEY'RE MARRIED.

 THEY'RE TOO OLD, WILL!

 NO, THEY'RE NOT.

YOUR MAMA'S ONLY 40.

SHE COULD STILL HAVE A CHILD
IF SHE WANTED TO.

 OH, MY GOD ALMIGHTY!

I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
TELL ME THINGS LIKE THAT!

GOD KNOWS THE KIND OF
TERRIBLE DREAMS I'M

GONNA START HAVING NOW!

 HONEY, I ONLY TOLD YOU SO
THAT YOU COULD UNDERSTAND

THAT MARRIED PEOPLE DON'T
ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE CHILDREN

IF THEY DON'T WANT TO.

 I DON'T WANT TO.

I MEAN, I WANT TO,
BUT I'M SCARED TO.

 THEN WE'LL NEVER HAVE THEM.

 YOU PROMISE ME?

 I PROMISE.

DOES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?

 YES, IT CERTAINLY DOES.

YOU'RE SO SWEET.

YOU'RE THE SWEETEST THING
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

 YOU'RE MIGHTY SWEET YOURSELF.

 WHAT'S GOING ON?

 MR. DAVENPORT, I'M NERVOUS
ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU COMING IN

HERE AND SCARING ME THIS WAY.

 I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU,
LITTLE GIRL.

WHERE'S YOUR MAMA?

 SHE TOOK BROTHER FOR A WALK
TO HELP HIM GET HIS

STRENGTH BACK.

 YEAH, WE'RE GONNA LOSE
THE OLD BOY TOMORROW.

 UNCLE ALBERT'S
COMING FOR HIM.

 WHAT TIME IS HE LEAVING?

 2:30, I GUESS.

THAT IS IF ALBERT DOESN'T
GET INTO A GAMBLING GAME.

THEY'RE A FOOL TO SEND ALBERT.

EVERY PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER
IN HOUSTON KNOWS HIM.

 BUT HE HAS TO GO BACK.

HE'S GOT A STORE NOW, YOU KNOW?

 NOTHING NEVER STOPPED HIM
FROM GAMBLING.

NOT HIS JOB, NOT HIS WIFE,
NOT HIS CHILDREN.

I GIVE HIM SIX MONTHS,
HE'LL BE GONE.

HE'LL BE CLERKING
FOR SOMEONE ELSE AGAIN.

 DID YOU HAVE A NICE WALK?

 A SLOW WALK.

 I HEAR YOU HAVE A JOB.

 YES, CLERKING FOR MY UNCLE
IN HARRISON.

 HE'S GONNA STAY WITH
MY SISTER, VIRGIE.

AT LEAST UNTIL HE GETS
HIS STRENGTH BACK.

SHE'S A WONDERFUL COOK,
AND SHE LOVES HIM.

 DOES SHE HAVE ANY
CHILDREN OF HER OWN?

 JUST THE ONE.

A LITTLE GIRL.

HER HUSBAND SAID AFTER SEEING
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH

TO HAVE JUST THAT ONE,
THEY COULD DRAG HIM AROUND

THE COURTHOUSE SQUARE
BEFORE HE'D LET HER

GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

 YOU HUNGRY, PETE?

 PETE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY.

I NEVER KNEW A TIME
HE WASN'T HUNGRY.

 YOU DO PRETTY WELL
YOURSELF, WILL.

YOU GONNA STAY FOR SUPPER?

 NO, MA'AM.

I'M AFRAID IF I EAT
ANOTHER MEAL OVER HERE,

YOU'LL SEND ME A BOARD BILL.

 COME ON NOW, STAY FOR SUPPER.

 ALL RIGHT.

YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TWIST MY ARM.

I'LL STAY.

 WOULD YOU PLAY
LILY DALE
FOR ME?

 I DON'T KNOW
LILY DALE.

HOW CAN I PLAY IT FOR YOU?

 I'LL SING IT FOR YOU.

MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY IT THEN.

 ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY.

 CAN YOU PLAY IT NOW, SISTER?

 I DON'T WANT TO.

I WANNA PLAY MY CLASSICAL PIECE.

 GO AHEAD, HONEY.

PLAY YOUR CLASSICAL PIECE.

 I DON'T WANNA PLAY IT IF YOU
ALL DON'T WANT ME TO PLAY IT.

 OF COURSE WE WANT YOU TO.

DON'T WE, PETE?

 DOES IT HAVE A LOT
OF RUNS IN IT?

 YES.

 I ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN
IT HAS A LOT OF RUNS.

PLAY IT FOR US.

 NO, WILL DOESN'T
WANNA HEAR IT.

HE WANTS ME TO PLAY RAGS.

 NO, I WANNA HEAR
YOUR CLASSICAL PIECE.

 HOW ABOUT YOU, BROTHER?

 SURE I WANNA HEAR IT.

 IT'S THE LAST CHANCE
HE'LL GET TO HEAR IT.

 YOU SURE NOW?

 YES, I'M SURE.

 â™ªâ™ª
 ( indistinct chatter )

 HORACE, I BELIEVE I'LL STEP
IN THE BACK AND HAVE A CIGAR

IN THE SMOKING SECTION.

 YES, SIR.

 WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

 I DON'T FEEL LIKE SMOKING.

 I HAVE SOME CHEWING TOBACCO.

 NO, SIR, THANK YOU.

 WELL, HORACE,
I MAY BE A WHILE.

THERE'S A POKER GAME GOING ON
BACK THERE AND I THINK I CAN

GET IN IT.

I FEEL VERY LUCKY TODAY.

 YES, SIR.

 BUT I KNOW YOU WON'T TELL
MY WIFE OR VIRGIE ABOUT THIS.

 NO, SIR.

 GOOD BOY, HORACE.

 Lily Dale: BROTHER'S NEVER
SEEMED VERY HAPPY TO ME

IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

WAS HE EVER HAPPY?

 I THINK SO.

I HOPE SO.

 HE'S DETERMINED,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

HE TOOK WILL ASIDE
AND ASKED HIM TO STOP BY

GOGGAN'S TO PICK UP THIS SHEET
MUSIC FOR HIM AND PLAY IT

FOR HIM.

 I'M GLAD HE GOT A CHANCE
TO HEAR IT AT LEAST ONCE

BEFORE HE LEFT.

 DO YOU THINK
IT'S A PRETTY PIECE?

 YES, I THINK IT'S VERY SWEET.

 DO YOU THINK THE GIRL
ON THE COVER LOOKS LIKE ME?

 I GUESS SHE DOES.

 I'M PRETTIER THAN HER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

 YES, I DO.

 YOU THINK I'M BEAUTIFUL?

 YES, I DO.

 WILL SAYS I'M BEAUTIFUL
ENOUGH TO BE IN MOTION PICTURES.

I HOPE HE'S SINCERE
WHEN HE SAYS IT.

 OH, I'M SURE HE IS.

 WILL SAYS...

YOU AND MR. DAVENPORT...

IF YOU WANTED...

MR. DAVENPORT AND YOU...

 COULD WHAT, HONEY?

 NOTHING.

I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK.

 â™ªâ™ª
 EXCUSE ME.

AREN'T YOU THE YOUNG MAN THAT
I MET ON THE WAY TO HOUSTON

THREE WEEKS AGO?

 YES, MA'AM.

 I THOUGHT SO.

WAS THAT MR. ALBERT THORNTON
OF HARRISON SITTING WITH YOU?

 YES, MA'AM.

 I THOUGHT SO.

 HE'S MY UNCLE.

 OF COURSE.

YOU LOOK TERRIBLE, SON.

HAVE A SPELL OF MALARIA?

 I'VE HAD A SPELL
OF SOMETHING.

I'VE BEEN PRETTY SICK.

 WELL, YOU STILL
LOOK SICK TO ME.

MAY I SIT AND VISIT
WITH YOU A WHILE?

 YES, MA'AM.

 ( train whistle blows )
 I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M NOT

DOWN MYSELF, AS MUCH AS I HAVE
TO BEAR.

MR. COONS IS SICK AGAIN,
YOU KNOW?

 NO.

 OH, YES.

LOST HIS JOB, OF COURSE.

WE HAVE TO MOVE AGAIN.

I'VE BEEN IN HOUSTON
WHERE HE'S STARTING ANOTHER

KEELEY CURE.

HE SWEARS THIS IS THE
LAST TIME THIS WILL HAPPEN.

"WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US,
MR. COONS?" I SAID.

"I AM UNEDUCATED.

I CAN'T WORK.

YOU GET SICK AND CAN'T
KEEP A JOB."

( sighs )
OF COURSE, YOU UNDERSTAND

WHAT KIND OF SICKNESS
I AM TALKING ABOUT.

WHISKEY!

THAT IS THE KIND OF SICKNESS
I AM TALKING ABOUT.

HE JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO LEAVE IT ALONE.

 Lily Dale: DID YOU LOVE PAPA
WHEN YOU MARRIED HIM?

 YES, I DID.

AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID.

 WHO DID YOU LOVE MOST,
PAPA OR MR. DAVENPORT?

 MR. DAVENPORT.

HE'S A VERY GOOD MAN.

HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME.

HE JUST DOESN'T SEEM
TO LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

I WISH THAT WOULD CHANGE.

 BROTHER DOESN'T
LIKE HIM, EITHER.

WHO DO YOU LOVE MOST,
ME OR BROTHER?

 OH, I LOVE YOU BOTH, HONEY.

 YOU LOVE ME MOST.

 I LOVE YOU BOTH.

 I THINK YOU LOVE ME MOST.

 WELL, YOU'RE A GIRL.

SO I THINK YOU NEEDED ME MORE.

 I'M NEVER GONNA LEAVE YOU AND
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LEAVE ME.

 OH, HONEY...

YOU'RE GONNA GET MARRIED...

AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LIVE WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

 WHY CAN'T WILL
MOVE IN HERE WITH US?

 NO, THAT WOULDN'T
BE PRACTICAL.

 THAT'S WHAT WILL SAYS, TOO.

WELL, THEN WE'LL JUST MOVE
INTO THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR,

AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT,
THEN JUST AS CLOSE AS WE CAN.

 â™ªâ™ª
 HOW DID YOU FIND YOUR MOTHER?

 SHE'S WELL.

 AND YOUR SISTER?

 SHE'S FINE.

 I BET THEY WERE GLAD TO SEE
YOU AND SORRY TO SEE YOU GO.

DID YOU ASK YOUR MOM ABOUT
YOUR BAPTISM?

 YES, MA'AM.

I HAVEN'T BEEN.

 MERCY!

SICK AS YOU LOOK, I WOULDN'T
PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER.

IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF YOU
DIED WITHOUT BEING BAPTIZED.

HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT
TO YOUR MAKER?

 PRAY FOR ME, MRS. COONS.

 WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO PRAY ABOUT?

THAT YOU LIVE UNTIL
YOU'RE BAPTIZED?

 NO, MA'AM, JUST...

PRAY FOR ME AND MY MOTHER
AND MY SISTER.

 ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

I DON'T KNOW YOUR SISTER
AND YOUR MOTHER, BUT I'LL BE

GLAD TO INCLUDE THEM
IN MY PRAYERS.

 NOW, MRS. COONS.

PRAY FOR US NOW,
THIS VERY MOMENT.

 WHY CERTAINLY, SON.

FATHER, I'M TURNING TO YOU
ON THIS TRAIN...

I TURN TO YOU NOW AND ASK YOU
TO FORGIVE OUR SINS,

AND YOUR BLESSINGS--
 MY MOTHER AND MY SISTER

AND ME.

PRAY FOR US, MRS. COONS.

PRAY FOR US.

 GIVE ME TIME, SON.

I'M GETTING TO YOU ALL.

FATHER...

WHAT IS YOUR MOTHER'S NAME?

 CORELLA.

 AND YOUR SISTER'S?

 LILY DALE.

 FATHER, I HAVE BEEN ASKED
TO REMEMBER IN MY PRAYERS
