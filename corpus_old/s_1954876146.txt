           INITIATING
    FINAL TIMENADO APPROACH.

    Benson:<i> RIGHT BEHIND YOU,</i>

 YES, ADMIRAL.
                 YES, ADMIRAL.

      POPS, YOU'RE UP TOP.

        OKAY.

         FOLLOW MY LEAD.

           GO! GO! GO!

              COME ON, RANGERS!

          [ ALL GASP ]

                    IT'S
           THE TEMPORAL CRYSTAL.

             NOW WE DESTROY IT.
                   SKIPS.

         MM.

            AW, YEAH.
       GOOD JOB, RANGERS.

        MISSION OBJECTIVE
      ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED.

    NOW TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN
      FOR JUST ONE SECOND.

              UGH!

        All: MUSCLE MAN.

      HUH? OOH!

                 OVER THERE!

     TAKE COVER!

       FIVES!

     [ PANTING ]

           CEASE FIRE.

        RIGBY AND BENSON,
       YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED.

   DUDE, YOU CAN TOTALLY STOP
         THIS BLOODSHED.

            GIVE UP.

    HEY, TRAITOR,
HOW'S THE HAND HOLDING UP?

     [ LAUGHS ]

YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE,

WHILE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

             GO STUFF IT, ROSS.

  YEAH, YOU NEED TO
   CHILL OUT, MAN.

   FORGET ALL THIS
ERASING-TIME BUSINESS.

     CHILL OUT?! OH, I THINK
    I WAS PRETTY CHILLED OUT

WHEN I WENT TO PRISON BECAUSE OF
 YOU AND MORDECAI'S LITTLE STUNT

      BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

 BUT I GUESS I SHOULD THANK YOU

          FOR CREATING
     THIS WONDERFUL WEAPON.

                WHAT ARE YOU
               TALKING ABOUT?

   MORDECAI AND RIGBY CREATED
          THE TIMENADO.

                    WHAT?
       LIAR!

       OH,<i> I'M</i> THE LIAR?!
     HA! THAT'S A GOOD ONE!

     ISN'T THAT A GOOD ONE,
            MORDECAI?

              YEAH, HILARIOUS.

     I KNOW WHAT YOU DID, RIGBY,
     AND I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

      [ GASPS ]

     DUDE, I DIDN'T GET IN.

              COMMANDER RIGBY!

       IT WAS
SUCH A LONG TIME AGO.

I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

     I DON'T NEED YOU TO TELL ME
                WHAT YOU DID.

          IF WE GET OUT OF HERE,
              COULD YOU FIX IT?

              RIGBY, FIX THIS.

              THAT'S AN ORDER.

                 [ SCREAMS ]
    NO, ADMIRAL!

            RUN! RUN!

      THIS ONE'S FOR POPS!

           AND SKIPS!

         AND MUSCLE MAN!

           AND FIVES!

                 [ GRUNTS ]

                     HA!

       STUPID!

      STUPID!

       <i> TIME CIRCUITS ON.</i>

  TAKE ME BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.

        GOT TO FIX THIS.

     <i> CALCULATING TIME JUMP.</i>

   STOP THAT SHIP
IN THE NAME OF LORD ROSS.

           WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,
                    MAN?

                HOW COULD YOU
                WORK FOR<i> HIM?</i>

     I COULDN'T
STAY AT THE PARK FOREVER.

   I HAD TO THINK
    OF MY CAREER.

         HOW ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?

 WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

WE HAVEN'T BEEN FRIENDS
  FOR A LONG TIME.

           [ BEEPING ]

        <i> COURSE PLOTTED.</i>

 PRESS THAT BUTTON,
AND I WILL SHOOT YOU.

              HEY, MORDECAI...

  Both: WHA-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A...

     Â¶ WHAT'S UP, EILEEN? Â¶

       Â¶ YOU'RE THE QUEEN
      OF THE COFFEE BEANS Â¶

 Â¶ FILL THEM UP, FILL THEM UP Â¶

      Â¶ CAN'T START THE DAY
         WITHOUT A CUP Â¶

    YOU KNOW, YOU COULD JUST
        ASK FOR A REFILL

       LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

         [ BOTH LAUGH ]

       WHAT'S UP, THOUGH?

    I NEVER SEE YOU GUYS HERE
           THIS EARLY.

             BREAKFAST BURRITOS
         FROM THE TRUCK OUTSIDE.

    BEST BURRITOS
    IN THE CITY!

IT'S THE NAME OF THE PLACE,
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

  EH, I'VE NEVER SUBSCRIBED TO
  ORDERING FOOD FROM A VEHICLE.

 WHAT TIME ARE YOU GUYS SUPPOSED
     TO BE AT WORK, THOUGH?

                   OH, NO.

      [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ]

        DUDE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
         YOU GASSED UP THE CART.

      MM, YEAH,
  WHAT I MEANT WAS,

I DIDN'T GAS UP THE CART,
LET'S GO GET BREAKFAST BURRITOS.

         OW!

              WOULD IT KILL YOU
              TO TELL THE TRUTH

          EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

        WAIT!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

                  COME ON.

          [ CHUCKLES ]

  HEY, GUYS, MEETING IN EIGHT.

           [ SNIFFS ]

              UGH!

                [ CHUCKLES ]

           YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS
             A MEETING IN EIGHT?

     OOOH, JOLLY GOOD SHOW!

     [ PANTING ]

         [ WHIMPERING ]

              UGH!

                   GET UP.

                  COME ON!

        MORDECAI. RIGBY.

          MEETING IN --

      [ SIGHS ] OF COURSE.

        WAIT!

         WAIT!

         Mordecai: WAIT!

              WAIT!

                 WE'RE HERE!

              AAH! WE'RE HERE!
     [ PANTING ]

     WE MADE IT!

 WE MADE IT ON TIME.

    [ CHUCKLES ]

    HA!
               HA!

            UH, YEAH,
       YOU'RE NOT ON TIME

  BECAUSE THE MORNING MEETING'S
          ALREADY OVER!

   SORRY, BENSON.

WE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE SOONER,
BUT THE CART RAN OUT OF GAS.

YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T
   RUN OUT OF GAS?

             LEAVE!

          [ ALL GASP ]

             GOOD LUCK, FELLAS.

                BAD SHOW.

    YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST
         WALK INTO WORK

   WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

       WE HAVE RULES HERE.

  AND WHEN YOU BREAK THE RULES,

        YOU'RE GONNA PAY
        THE CONSEQUENCES.

   WAIT, PAY THE CONSEQUENCES,
    OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES?

FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.

     FACE THE CONSEQUENCES!

   WHAT ARE THOSE?

      THESE ARE PINK SLIPS.

       ONE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT,
       AND ONE WITH YOURS ON IT.

              AND NOW IT'S TIME
         FOR ME TO SAY THE WORDS

        I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SAY
              FOR A LONG TIME.

                YOU'RE FIRED!

          [ BOTH GASP ]

NO, BENSON, YOU CAN'T!

                    YEAH,
           WE GOT A GOOD EXCUSE!

                 OH, REALLY?
                WHAT'S THAT?

          WE BOUGHT YOU
       BREAKFAST BURRITOS.

                    WHAT?

            YOU KNOW,
     JUST TO SAY WE'RE SORRY

     FOR MESSING UP AT WORK
 ALL THE TIME, RIGHT, MORDECAI?

      UH, YEAH.

   BEST BURRITOS IN THE CITY.

                     Â¶Â¶

                    DUDE,
              THAT WAS AWESOME!

     WHEN DID YOU WRITE HIS NAME
                 ON THE BAG?

PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE TIME
   HE WAS TALKING.

THE OLD "WRITING NOTES
BEHIND THE BACK" TRICK.

  MASTERED THAT ONE
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

             [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH,
      THE ONLY FLAW IN YOUR PLAN

       IS THAT NOW I'M STARVING.

    YEAH, ME TOO.

YOU WANT TO SNEAK OFF
 AND GET SOME FOOD?

  NAH, BENSON'S BEEN WATCHING US
              THIS WHOLE TIME.

I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
RIDE THIS OUT UNTIL DINNER.

             PFFT, YEAH, RIGHT.

      IF WE HAVE TO GO THAT LONG
          BEFORE TAKING A BREAK,

    THEN I'M GONNA START LOOKING
              FOR ANOTHER JOB.

    YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE THE PARK.

             I DON'T KNOW, DUDE.
              I'M JUST SAYING.

       IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN JUST

        KEEP WORKING AT THE PARK
             FOREVER, YOU KNOW?

WHATEVER. YOU SAY THAT NOW.
     [ GROANS ]

             I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

 BUT I JUST THINK IT'S SOMETHING
          WE REALLY SHOULD BE --

        RUN!

        DUDE, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
              FROM THE FUTURE!

                     Â¶Â¶

        AAH!

                    AAH!

       [ BOTH SCREAMING ]

   GET OFF, DUDE.

             YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

     WHOO-O-O-O!
  THAT WAS AWESOME!

              WHAT DID YOU DO?!

          IT WASN'T US!
    [ COUGHS ]

  YEAH, THAT METEOR
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

              UH, I DON'T THINK
          THAT'S A METEOR, GUYS.

              WHOA!

                IT LOOKS LIKE
           SOME SORT OF VEHICLE.

          A SPACESHIP.

        THERE'S GOT TO BE
        A DOOR SOMEWHERE.

             Benson: RIGBY, NO!
            GET AWAY FROM THERE!

        DUDE,
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

      RELAX, I JUST WANT TO
          CHECK IT OUT.

              AAAH!

         [ WHIMPERING ]

   I CAN'T BE ABDUCTED, BROS.
      I'M PROBE SENSITIVE.

                 [ GROANS ]

                    UGH!

                   THAT'S
          A WEIRD-LOOKING ALIEN.

        DUDE,
 HE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

    YEAH,
BUT WAY COOLER.

              HELP.

           [ GROANS ]

            OH, GEEZ!

THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

THAT'S NOT GOOD, RIGHT?

                  UNH-UNH.

    WHO ARE YOU?

         IT'S ME. RIGBY.

     I'VE TRAVELED BACK FROM
  THE FUTURE TO SEEK YOUR HELP.

BUT HOW CAN YOU BE RIGBY?
YOU LOOK SO AWESOME.

             THANKS.
     I REALLY GREW INTO IT.

           [ COUGHS ]

  THE UNIVERSE IS ON THE VERGE
       OF BEING DESTROYED.

 AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YOU TRIED
     TO MAKE A TIME MACHINE

         IN HIGH SCHOOL.

      WHAT?
                       WHAT?

    WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
        HOW CAN THAT BE?

       RIGBY,
  WHAT DID YOU DO?

         WHAT?! NOTHING!

 OH, YEAH, I'M SURE.

   IS THIS FOR REAL RIGHT NOW?

        BUT I LIKE THE UNIVERSE!

          STOP TALKING!

           [ GROANS ]

    THAT FAILED TIME MACHINE
         WAS THE GENESIS

     OF A MASSIVE TIMENADO.

        Both: A TIMENADO?

    A TIME-WHAT?

                 TIMENADO --

       A TORNADO THAT CAN TRAVEL
         THROUGH SPACE AND TIME.

       COME ON, BENSON, KEEP UP.

WAIT, WAIT, BUT I THOUGHT
WE JUST BLEW UP THE SCIENCE LAB.

   THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO,
  BUT IT TURNS OUT WHAT WE DID

        CREATED SOMETHING
      FAR MORE DESTRUCTIVE.

  THE TIMENADO WAS A PHENOMENA
         OF GREAT POWER.

   ITS TERMINAL ENERGY CREATES
      PORTALS THROUGH TIME,

       NORMALLY HARMLESS.

   BUT NOW HAS BEEN HARNESSED
         AND WEAPONIZED

    BY A MADMAN CALLED ROSS.

                  MR. ROSS?
              OUR OLD TEACHER?

        THE ONE AND ONLY.

   ROSS IS USING THE TIMENADO
  TO SUCK UP EARTH'S TIMELINE.

   ENTIRE PIECES OF THE FUTURE
        ARE BEING ERASED.

     PORTALS START APPEARING
      ONE AFTER THE OTHER,

         RIPPING THROUGH
       THE FABRIC OF TIME

     UNTIL NOTHING IS LEFT.

     YEARS, WHOLE DECADES --
       GONE IN AN INSTANT.

 THE INTERGALACTIC PARK RANGERS
   HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STOP IT

          TO NO AVAIL.

       MORDECAI AND RIGBY,
   YOU NEED TO GO BACK IN TIME

     TO STOP US FROM TRYING
    TO MAKE THAT TIME MACHINE

 OR ALL OF TIME WILL BE ERASED.

                WELL, WHY US?

YEAH, WHY DIDN'T YOU GO BACK
    AND STOP IT?

        I WAS TRYING TO,

        BUT GETTING SHOT
    KIND OF CHANGED THE PLAN.

   WHAT HAPPENED?
    WHO SHOT YOU?

              HIM.

          [ ALL GASP ]
                   OH, MY!

                YOU SHOT ME?!

      WHAT? NO!
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

              WHOA,
  YOU GUYS STOP BEING FRIENDS?

    [ INDISTINCT MUTTERING ]

          HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

                   RIGBY,
             COME HERE...CLOSER.

              DON'T [ COUGHS ]

      AW, MAN!

     DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE
                   I DID.

                 [ COUGHS ]
   DUDE, COME ON!

              [ COUGHS, GAGS ]

                  YOU HAVE
             TO TELL THE TRUTH,

              EVEN IF IT MEANS
              LOSING MORDECAI.

              IT'S THE ONLY WAY
           TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE.

         THIS IS CRAZY.

           IT'S CRAZY.

   WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?
      TIME BEING DESTROYED?

    I -- I -- I -- I -- I...

WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT THIS TIME MACHINE?

             WELL, ALL WE WANTED
              AFTER HIGH SCHOOL

                WAS TO GO TO
             COLLEGE U TOGETHER.

              BUT RIGBY GOT IN,
                AND I DIDN'T.

            SO WE TRIED TO BUILD
       A TIME MACHINE TO FIX IT.

   BUT IT EXPLODED AND DESTROYED
          THE WHOLE SCIENCE LAB.

        WHOA!

WAIT, RIGBY GOT ACCEPTED,
AND YOU WERE REJECTED?

BUT RIGBY DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

                    HEY!

YOU MUST'VE REALLY TANKED
ON THAT COLLEGE ESSAY.

     PFFT. YEAH, WHO KNOWS.

      WE BOTH GOT EXPELLED,

    AND OUR SCIENCE TEACHER,
      MR. ROSS, GOT FIRED.

      RIGBY DIDN'T GRADUATE
    AND LOST HIS SCHOLARSHIP

     TO COLLEGE UNIVERSITY.

  AND I ENDED UP JUST GOING TO
         JUNIOR COLLEGE.

      RIGBY CRASHED WITH ME
           AT MY DORM,

  I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE, AND
THEN WE LOAFED AROUND FOR A BIT,

         WE GOT THIS JOB
         AT THE PARK --

       OKAY, OKAY. I THINK WE'RE
   CAUGHT UP, MONOLOGUE JOHNSON.

       I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

   HOW CAN MORDECAI AND RIGBY
       STOP BEING FRIENDS?

IF THEY CAN'T MAKE IT,
THEN YOU AND ME HAVE NO CHANCE.

           YEAH, BRO.

     WHAT WAS THE FUTURE YOU
             SAYING

    ABOUT YOU HAVING TO TELL
     THE TRUTH OR SOMETHING?

     DID MORDO BLOW YOU AWAY
     OVER SOME CRAZY SECRET?

                UH, WHAT? NO.
               I-I DON'T KNOW.

            IT MUST BE SOMETHING
     THAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE.

    THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
     THIS HAS TO BE A PRANK.

     THIS HAS TO BE A PRANK.

           MUSCLE MAN,
   I WON'T EVEN BE MAD AT YOU

   IF YOU JUST TELL ME YOU'RE
   ORCHESTRATING ALL OF THIS.

        BRO,
I'M SOMEWHAT FLATTERED

THAT YOU'D THINK MY CRAFT
  IS AT THIS LEVEL,

  BUT, ULTIMATELY,
I'M DEEPLY OFFENDED THAT

"A" -- YOU THINK I'D PUT MY BUDS
THROUGH THIS TURMOIL,

AND "B" -- THAT YOU'D THINK
I'D LISTEN TO ORCHESTRA MUSIC!

             WELL, I DON'T KNOW
                WHAT YOU GUYS

             ARE TRYING TO PULL
              WITH ALL THIS...

      DUDE, IF WE WANTED TO
        GET OUT OF WORK,

   WE'D JUST PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

       I THINK
THIS IS FOR REAL, MAN.

               SKIPS, COME ON.

   I HAVE A FEELING WE SHOULD
      TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

                   WHAT?!

            HOW CAN WE EVEN KNOW

               THAT THIS THING
     IS REALLY FROM THE FUTURE?!

         [ DOOR OPENS ]
   GUYS, CHECK OUT THIS SWEET
FUTURE GUN I FOUND IN THAT SHIP!

           [ LAUGHS ]

              WHOO!

                    COOL!

      AWESOME!

      MUSCLE MAN, NO! WAIT!

            PEW. PEW.

            PEW. PEW.

                 [ PANTING ]

       MUSCLE MAN, PUT THAT DOWN
            BEFORE YOU BREAK IT.

     CHILL, BRO.
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WORKS.

      OH, WAIT.

           All: WHOA!

        WHOO!

 THIS BABY'S LEGIT!

       DON'T WORRY, DUDE.
I MISSPELL MY NAME ALL THE TIME.

     SEE, ANYONE
CAN MAKE THAT MISTAKE.

    YEAH, BUT YOU'RE THE SAME --
                 NEVER MIND.

            SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING
             WITH YOU GUYS NOW?

   UH, WE'RE GONNA
DISAPPEAR BACK TO THE FUTURE.

        YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T DO IT
             WITH YOU WATCHING.

      'CAUSE THAT HAPPENED!

 WE TOLD YOU TO RUN.

      A LITTLE LATE, RIGBY!

        GUYS, CAN WE PLEASE JUST
              GET OUT OF HERE?

             I DON'T WANT THOSE

       YOU'RE RIGHT, POPS.

    WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU GUYS
 ACTUALLY CAME THROUGH FOR ONCE.

            GOOD JOB.

              WHAT DID YOU DO?

     NOTHING, SKIPS. HONEST.

  WE JUST WENT TO THE BATHROOM
           REAL QUICK,

     AND WHEN WE CAME BACK,
       THE SHIP WAS GONE.

     THE SHIP DOESN'T EVEN WORK.
             HOW CAN IT BE GONE?

         AND WHY ARE YOU NAKED?!

            'CAUSE I'M YOU, BRO.

AND YOU'RE NOT DRIVING THIS SHIP
             INTO THE CRASH PIT.

WHATEVER. YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO, OLD MAN.

        ACTUALLY, I CAN, BECAUSE
I KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T.

    WHAT'S THAT?

                ALWAYS GUARD
              YOUR PEPPERONIS.

 GIVE ME 20 MINUTES.

           [ GROANS ]

 OKAY, UNTIL THEN, I'M GONNA GO
     TRY AND FIND A SHOWER.

       DOES THIS SHIP HAVE
           A BATHROOM?

  DON'T YOU GET IT?

  YOU JUST CREATED

     WE'RE HERE!

              WHAT?
   WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL US?

           BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT TO
                  PAY OFF.

     WHY DON'T YOU TELL MORDECAI

      AT WEST ANDERSON HIGH

       HAS LEFT THE ENTIRE
  SCIENCE DEPARTMENT DESTROYED.

 LET'S GO TO OUR AERIAL COVERAGE
     UP IN CHOPPER 6. FRANK?

         Frank: I TELL YOU, JIM.
   IT'S PRETTY CRAZY DOWN THERE.

               I'VE NEVER SEEN
             ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

    WH-O-O-O-OA.

                  MARGARET,
             STAY BACK, SWEETIE.

SO YOU'RE TELLING ME, YOU TRIED
TO BUILD A TIME MACHINE

USING MR. ROSS' PLUTONIUM

     AND BLEW UP
THE WHOLE SCIENCE LAB?!

             -YEAH.
             -YEAH.

              OKAY, I CAN EXP--

                     OW!

YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL, ROSS.

   AND YOU TWO --
I'M CALLING YOUR PARENTS.

YOU TWO ARE EXPELLED.

                    WAIT.

BEFORE YOU GO, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY TO MR. ROSS.

           I'M SORRY FOR RUINING

   YOUR STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME,
                  MR. ROSS.

               I KNOW IT MEANT
                A LOT TO YOU,

        AND IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,
YOU GUYS TOTALLY COULD HAVE WON.

                 I'M SORRY.

           [ GROWLS ]

           THAT'S ALL
   I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR.

     HOO, MAN. [ CHUCKLES ]

             I FEEL
       SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

            YOU KNOW,
       I WAS ABOUT TO PLAN

      A CRAZY, COMPLICATED
      REVENGE PLAN ON YOU,

    BUT NOW I DON'T FEEL LIKE
       DOING THAT AT ALL.

       HA! NOW I FEEL LIKE
     WE CAN BE BEST FRIENDS.

YOU GUYS WANT TO GO GET BURGERS?
            MY TREAT.

WHAT DO YOU SAY, PRINCIPAL DEAN?
       CAN WE GET BURGERS?

         NO!
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL!

            OH, YEAH.

     NOW MARCH!

      OW. WOW! OW! HA! OW.

        OH, MAN, COME ON.

    I SAID MARCH!

     EVEN THOUGH
THEY WERE REALLY COOL,

I HOPE WE NEVER TURN OUT
     LIKE THEM.

  I PROMISE I'LL NEVER SHOOT YOU
                WITH A LASER.

I PROMISE I'LL NEVER
 LASER YOU, EITHER.

           [ WARBLE! ]

             -WHOA.
             -WHOA.

                       WELL...

      I GUESS THAT WRAPS A NEAT,
   LITTLE BOW AROUND EVERYTHING.

        MORDECAI, RIGBY.

   A NEW DAY, A NEW BEGINNING.

        [ Normal voice ]
   NOW, YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE,

    BUT WE CAN WORK ON THA--

       MORDECAI AND RIGBY!

                    OKAY.
              THAT'LL BE $3.95?

      UH, SORRY. HOW MUCH?

                   $3.95.

      OH, OKAY.
    HERE YOU GO.

COULD YOU JUST THROW THE FOOD
      UP HERE?

WE'RE IN KIND OF A HURRY.

       THANKS.

        DUDE,
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

     WE'RE LATE.

              PBHT!
         WE'RE NOT LATE.

           WE'RE NEVER
      GONNA BE LATE AGAIN.
