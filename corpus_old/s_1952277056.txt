Shane...

I don't know what are you talking about
you have the wrong man.

...That's Bullshit

We checked your past.

You are special forces

Someone took this guy apart!

Look at you!

Now you're  just a murderer.
What the hell happened to you?

The guy that car-jacked my wife.
I chased him off that didn't mean I killed him.

RAJ VARDHAN VARMA

I'm sorry, so very sorry.

I know I promised to wait for you
but I can't wait any longer.

Its been 6 years.
I need to move on...

I need to get my life back.

I love you so much.

Get out of here, Daniels.
bid day is tomorrow.

Counsel I take it that you all are ready?

We are..your honour I believe
you have a recommendation in front of you

As you read the prosecution has filed
for a dismissal of charge against my client.

and because of that we will expect certain details
to be included in the record when his record is expunged.

And what are those?

that a weapon, one that matches the ballistic's profile

of the one used in the initial murder
was recovered in the possession of another subject

..that the DNA of said subject matches the DNA
that was recovered in the initial murder investigation.

All of this was brought to light with the
help of the partict's innosence.

DNA was never admitted in the original trial?

OK !!

I find sufficient evidence to support the dismissal...

..of any and all charges against the defendant.

also the state will award Mr. Daniels $300,000.

$50,000 for each year Mr. Daniels
has erroneously incarserated

I trust you are satisfied
with that, Mr. Daniels.

Your honour...I gave 14 years
of my life in the military.

6 years hard time in a federal penetentionary,

I don't know why you people think
that.. money, can replace a life.

There are no words to describe..

What it's like when you..
an innocent man in prison

sitting there and waiting and hoping
and praying that this day would come.

I don't believe that money
can buy back my name,

my reputation, my wife,
my family and all that I lost.

Mr. Daniels, the court
recognizes your grief

and we sympathize with your loss

I don't want your money!
I want my life back.

Take him to the safe house

A nice lady like you needs
a nice car like this.

Come on, I'll take you for a ride

At your joy may off just tell
the cops whatever you want

Just give me a few hours to get into the wind.

Oh! my father'll disown me if I spoke
to the cops. Specially the ones from Bellinghams

Is your father a gangster or something?
...ex-con?

No! its like I said that my father is not
exactly an outstanding citizen.

Mean he sells cars that aren't
necessarily for sale, if you know what I mean

I can relate to that.

Hey! Welcome back!

I won't do that if I were you.
going by 70 miles per hour

Its okay we saved you
from those guys back there.

I mean we don't mean you any harm

Which means we were harmed
hey tecnically he did

I didn't drive the car though, are you going
with him? is she going with you?

Man I say just drop her off at the first cofee shop
No.

I can't go to the local police.
no why's that?

They're the ones who killed my friends
Damn .

Look I need to call my father.
Not till we reach Bellingham.

Then you are free to do whatever you want.
-But I need help didn't you hear me?

The cops killed my friends

My father will pay if you help me.
the problem is I don't need money.

I've whole bag of cash here.

May be instead of money your dad can get me
the f**k out of America. Could he do that?

He can
-Yeah, well ...

If you are so sure about that,
I tell you what son

Drop her and I off together and then you park this
piece of shit somewhere where nobody could see it and uhh

Hide it untill the fallen moon

you understand?

You don't trust anyone, do you?
It ain't about trust, its about survival.

Look, I need to call my father.

I need to tell him I'm okay.

Before you do that,
I think you and I need to have a little talk.

I already told you everything.
what more do you want me to say

You told me that your friends
were killed by local cops

that really doesn't explain to me how you ended up
in the trunk next to the bag of cash

I've already told you that was not my money.
what are you... deaf?

I want you to shut the f**k up!

I want you to pay attention and
to understand one thing

if I'm gonna try to save you and if I'm
gonna try to help you

you need to talk to me,
you need to listen to what I say..

..when I say, how I say

and if you don't, I will leave you here
to get eaten by the f**kin jackasses

..who're coming soon.

Okay

OK. I'm Sorry.

if you want me to help you,
you gotta talk to me man.

you gotta tell me straight so I can know who's
coming for us

you're right.

You saved my life.

I guess I owe you the truth.
I hope the truth would be nice.

I was trying to get my uncle into the country.

Here are they...coming now

I was contacted by someone
who said they could help.

They wanted me to go inside alone.
I don't like this Tia

I'll be okay.

I was told to shop alone,
but I insisted on bringing some of my friends.

since it was the first time we were meeting.

the man I met is a chinese drug smuggler

only known to me as Chen.

He told me that you would help
smuggle my uncle into the United States

I should 've known it was a trap.

it was all my fault.

I heard the shots.

I was in shock

they forced me into a room where
another man was waiting for me

he said that he was waiting for my uncle's arrival.

And that I was going to be helpful ransom

untill he got the information that
he needed from my uncle.

and then someone placed a cloth in my mouth.

Why would your father send you alone
to do this kind of thing?

he did'nt, I went against his wishes.

It was his preference to keep trying to get
my uncle here through legal channels.

you see I love my uncle and I had
to make sure that he escape from China.

escape from China?
My uncle is an accountant.

He wanted to go, but its not
a kind of job you can just quit

my uncle is involved with some senior members
in the Chinese army

these men are incharge of an area
known as the Golden Triangle.

a place in Burma, where the popeye's are cultivated.

sounds very familiar...very familiar

that's why he was denied entrance in the U.S..

So he is on the watchlist.
-Yes.

If he was an accountant that means
he knows where all the books are

What all the numbers are...

..where all the bodies are...
they're not got to let him go.

that guy is worth his weight in gold

but he is a good man, Shane.

and the man in the office..he is also Chinese?
they called him the "Colonel".

Chinese military, am I to say that?

My father was a military adviser.
I've been around the type my whole life.

he asked me some questions about my uncle.

almost like he was trying to make
sure I was who I said I was

I get it

I know what to do

...I know what to do

Richie..its Clark..come in

Go on Richie..over!

I think we've got it
ok, hang in there I'll be right there in 10.

where is my money?

..Where is my money

My money.
-What?

your money?

no..no..no the deal was-
I get half the money upfront

the other half when I give you the uncle.

that was my f**king money!

until he arrives its my money.

and that girl ...
I need her to control the uncle

and you lost her too
and I'm gonna get her back

you forget, the girl was a bonus.

you better deliver this bonus

if you want to do business with my backers
you need to be a little more responsible.

Yeah! you Find Them!
or you take care of it!

I gotta go.

He angry?

Chen! Please, I did my best.

Who has my money?
It was my fault boss

What the f**k?
now answer my f**king question:

Who has my money?

and more importantly, where is the girl?

...is a big guy, may be INDIAN
I dont know

he took the money...
and he took the girl

the girl might remember how to get back here.
we should go to the safe house

we have plenty of unknowns.

state cops have to go through Bellingham
before they get here.

what about the dead trooper?
-Ritchie should have handle on that, right?

"Yeah."
-local cops are in my pocket.

Ritchie says he found the abandoned car
he'd send her uptown.

he also said prints on the outside of the car
belong to a dead Russian kid

Russian?

Yeah

Russians..
Damn!!

Ok...well you make sure Ritchie
has the description of this Indian guy

you send'em to the Russians
and get'em to talk to him

then you grab a few men
and you start searching the town.

nobody leaves without us knowing

Understood?
get the f**k outta here

bleed now out of my office!

Russians and Indians...Hmm!!

Chen says that the Russians are hiding this guy
you better make them give him up

Awright

Got it?
-Understood

I hate tell the Lo Chen

Dimitri, two more
-Ok..coming right up

Yes! go on..

yeah nothing lag back to us,
covered our tracks, covered the vehicle

I mean we were just minding our own businesses

a cop pulled up and...huh!
we were little freaked so..

you know how suddenly the other 2 guys
get out and come out of nowhere

my cuff heads off down in the dark
and dock for cover

he should've stayed low..
..he should've stayed low

Hey!..who is the guy in-charge here?

so the guy comes out of nowhere I dont know
he seemed to help me out of situation so

just...can't cope with it

I'm looking for the driver of a blue sub-urban

people around here tell me you deal in cars

no.

people probably tells you lesser things...hmm!

but I bet most of it..bullshit

Why don't you go back to your side of town
cowboy?

we try keep to ourselves here
isn't that right?

see... no one's here wants to whisper
when a cop is here.

some euro trash just by your age
got himself killed down by the border-line.

did you know him?
Well I don't know any Euro-Trash...officer!

I'm trying to finish my meal here

but I don't easily can do that
with you standing here.

smells of you makes my stomach turn.

I will...cut your balls and then they'll
cut your throat. You understand?

you know I'm a cop! we are f**kin' cops

let me explain something to you...

where I come from, we...f**k cops in the
mouth when we are an out of form animals

If you want to hook us up
after you count you're dead

then don't forget...

that American chills
is paradise to us.

so think hard
before you jump.

We need this cleaned up.
Right.

what the f**k was that?

what we're just gonna walk away
that asshole just threatened you

listen to me, we walk away for right now
right...this is their polytown

Oh! gimme a break
this f**k is a crazy?

we can't take them all, not the 2 of us not right now
-We're the f**king law

Listen to me!

As soon as we handle this shit
I'm planning on paying 'em a little home visit.

O Yeah! there's a place and a time for everything.

now get in the f**king car!

So...this is your money.

unfortunately..I don't know if you can read Chinese but,

its obviously Chinese drug money.

So..

I'm sure folks are...looking for this
real hard

Who are you?
I mean, how do you know that?

I...was in the military for a long time

was in the army special forces.
I had a great career, very colourful

one day I lost it all

got accused of some I didn't do
did 6 years hard time.

was acquited of all wrong doing through

DNA evidence, they found out I had nothing to do
with the crime

I was let out recently...and...

look at me, I'm already in trouble again.

F**k!

this is a transponder...

which means people are probably
closin' in on us real quick you know

Get down, somebody's here

Let's go

Oh! God, I think I'm going really sick.
do while you rally

My Uncle is due to arrive today

I'm so worried about what might have
happened to him

awright.

How you doin?

here we have a young man called Serghey?

I've never heard of him.

he said that his father owns this place
somewhat called Vlad.

news to me

really?

okay.

Thank you.

lets go this is a waste of time.

Wait a minute..

this is them, those are Chen's men

why don't you tell me what business
you've got with Serghey?

poor boy owes me some money
you check with the father

What's in the bag?
None of your f**kin' business.

Little Russia, everything my business.

oh! how bad do you want to find out
what's in the bag, boy?

Who are you?

Where is he...huh?

Monsieur! Monsieur!

Okay let's go see your boss

Son of a bitch!

This guy is ain't with us and
whoever took him out is a professional

found this.
weren't we just there there?

so the motel's surveillance cameras
gave us a tentative ID

Guy's name is Shane Daniels he is just out enjoying

and guess what...

He is ex-special forces.
the guy is a f**king killing machine

still doesn't explain me why he screwed the asians
oh! you'll gonna love this

we found some kind of
tracking device in the room too.

may be my friend is being a little less than honest.

we both can come back to kill that piece of shit

No... I can handle him

So both ends of town are truly covered

then he's got to be somewhere close

no we slipped down to the Russians main docking

but our guy was there.

well then you take the gloves off and
you make the Russians talk!

sure you want to go there?

they went their first

Colonel...!

the man we're looking for, killed 2 da doo

do you want to know anything about it would you?

No I don't

liar!
-think before you act.

I am thinking

and I think those men were yours
and they were after my money.

You deliver it, and then you're trying to steal it back
-you are thinking too much.

oh no one's ever accused me of that before

the uncle arrives tonight.
-I still don't have the girl

Yeah! I'm aware of that now burn
that f**kin town at the ground

unless they hand over the girl before dawn

Now please...contact your people
and tell them to deliver my money

of course.

Hey!

Please sit down.

Welcome to my home.

perfect.

I heard a...a rumor about a Da Doo.

that they...thay preferred...

you know I...I'm almost started to think
that it is true you know coz

...coz look at these beautiful girls, they just..

umm...just dancing around and you're
not even...not even looking at them.

you're eating your food...

this one...

may be you like her huh..she's got
the ass! of a 9 year old boy huh, look at that

May be...hey hey hey may be

I'll let you take her from behind
you like her don't you colonel, huh? Yeah!

Where are you going? Colonel where
are you going huh? what?..what?

did...did I have your nerve?
where're you going buddy?

oh baby, I think I had a nerve

Come sit down to daddy

I owe this man my life father

life we find coarse for many things

we fight for our family, for our friends,
and for our pride...

but always maintain the code of honor

Without that, life has no meaning
-I understand that.

 Where's your family?
My family's gone.

I see that in your eyes

You're the man who put others ahead of himself

not to garner other's respect but simply
because it's your very nature

you saved my son and for that I am
beyond grateful.

Please tell me what you need
if it's within my power I'll make it happen.

I don't like to start a fight unless I finish it and...

after this now they have her uncle and if
we don't step in they'll kill him

That is a serious problem.

where was this place they had you?
-It was an abandoned mill

about 50 miles out of town
not too far from the border.

the Chen's place...very secluded
he likes to do business over there

so you know this man
of course.

What do you think?

from now on you are my brother.

You son of a bitch
-You should be dead by now.

I just wanted to make sure the uncle arrives
before you screw that up too

my associates...will retaliate

you know they...they rely on me
to deliver their product across.

there's...there's a lot of money at stake here.

you think you matters...hmm?

you think I was going to pay you...huh?

the only reason I came to you...

to intercept the uncle, was because
you were easy to manipulate.

And I was right.
-you think you've done doo background on training?

make you untouchable?

It doesn't
he's coming...you see...

the Da Doo are the highest ranked warriors
of the Chinese people

something you know nothing about

I tell you what
I would do you a favor

I would unite you with your 9 year old boy...love her

Happy?

now you did it

did I have your nerve?

we're in

don't make a sound

answer me by nodding or
shaking your head

is the girl still here?

-Yes.

Very impressive!

You want your man?
