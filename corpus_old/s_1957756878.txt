You have made clear

Are you? (ROSS CHUCKLES)

You'll see.

We're prepared to make a

(VANCE GRUNTS) GAYER:
Smash the ball, bro.

You hit too hard. (SIGHS)

Golf is not strength, but speed.

VANCE: All right.
GAYER: Come on,

let's do another one.

Now, keep your eyes on the ball.

Always keep your
eyes on the ball.

Imagine a beautiful ass
passing right in front of you.

Beautiful, and now it's far.


eyes on the ball.

Let's hit another one.

That's way better.

As soon as we start talking
asses, you understand.


GAYER: You know
why it didn't go

as high as it should?

No, why is that?

'Cause you failed
to rotate your hips.

You play only with
your shoulders.

Okay. GAYER: Golf
is like tango,

you know? It's all
about the hips.

Tango? Yeah.

Like tango.

Or like, how to
make a woman cum.

If you don't have the right hip,

she's not gonna
stay long. Hmm.

So, give it a good hip kick
on the impact with the ball

and you'll see, it'll
go off on its own.

Interesting. GAYER: Yeah.

(VANCE EXHALES)

That's way better!
VANCE: Bye, bitch.

GAYER: Whoo!


(CELLPHONE BUZZES)

Yeah, hold on.

Yo, Hakim!

Hey, long time, bro.

VANCE: (OVER PHONE)
<i>Dude. You know me.</i>

Too much love to give.
Not enough takers.

Why everyone's
gotta be so patient,

I'll never understand.

<i>Just fucking take what you want,</i>

<i>you know what I'm saying?</i>

Fucking go for it.

So, what's up, brother?

Pierre's organizing another
one of his parties tonight.

<i>He'd love you to come.</i>

Hell yeah, I'm gonna come.

Fuck, you have no idea
how much I needed this.

I'm in.

Yo, I gotta jet,

but I'll see you
later, all right?

I got a call from the label.

They're saying you're looking
at mid-eight figures easy.

And <i>System Raping</i>
is a hit on YouTube.

That is what I am talking about!

Fuck yeah! Dude,
thank you so much.

I could not have done
any of this without you.

Seriously, thank you. I know.

You know, I'm here

for only ten percent.

Now, let's go.

Yo, so check this out. (GROANS)

My social media manager,
Hakim. GAYER: Yeah?

He's got this French friend

who organizes these
special parties.

And the best part about
special parties in Morocco,

is that I'm not going to
have to fork over a shitload

to a bunch of lawyers after.

What are you saying? GAYER:
Nothing. Just a joke.


I want to know. Relax.

What did you mean by
that? Relax, relax.

I was just joking. Relax.

Let me make it up to you.

See those three
girls over there.

I'll bring them to you
on a silver platter.

Hmm?

You know that does make
me feel much better.

I know. Let me do the work.

You just have to relax

and be the superstar
that you are.

Fuckin' pansy-ass bitch.

GAYER: I'm Gayer,

KENZA: Hey, Vance!

We're big fans. Your

we could take a picture

Yeah, sure. Here, let me do it.

I've got longer, uh, everything.

(ALL CHUCKLE)

What's your name? I'm Kenza.

And my beautiful

She's absolutely
crazy about you.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you.

Um, we're so happy to
have you here in Morocco.

I hope you're
enjoying your time.

Oh, hell yeah.

You know what, are
you two doing anything

later tonight? Not

No, I got a friend who's, uh,

making a small
little get together.

Would you and your
beautiful friend

like to come? (CHUCKLES)

KENZA: Sure. Yes,

I'd love to come, to the party.

Uh...(CHUCKLES)
...um. (CHUCKLES)

We'll send you a message on
Instagram. Yeah, wonderful.

Actually, you know
what, don't DM me.

I might not get that.

Why don't you just put

This is my very

And you said yes?

Of course, we did.
Who would say no?

(RITA SCOFFS)

Oh, come on, don't start

Sorry guys, just

Yo Hakim, what's up?

Hey, buddy. Last night was epic.

Yeah, it was great.

Maybe next time,
something a little more

exclusive though.

You got anything in mind?

No. Pierre's got
all the hook-ups.

Fuck, Pierre.

Dude, just give me some
place out of the way.

And can you find me some girls

that like to get a
little bit freaky,

not those who think
that love is just a kiss

and a fucking selfie.

<i>Yo, you know what,

Why don't you just get

and find me someplace
quiet, ideally by a lake.

I may have the perfect

Yo, one more thing.

Can you find me
some better muscle?

I got the best one.

Terrific.

Yo, just send him to the hotel

I'll be by the pool.

Cheers. <i>Yallah.</i>

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

Hakim Aouzad? Mya?

Nice to finally meet you. Hey.

Pleasure is mine. Have a seat.

Hi. Hi.

(HAKIM EXHALES)

Anything to drink?

I'll have a Moroccan tea.

(SPEAKS ARABIC)

The city is absolutely gorgeous.

Is the whole country like this?

Overall yeah, but we
still have a few people

living in the past.

Anyway, what drew
you to Morocco?

I'm a teacher.

Hmm.

Teaching what?

Math.

So, you wanna see the
souk? The mosques?

Not exactly.

I would like to see the
other side of Morocco,

connect with the locals a bit.

You came to the right guy.
I got all the secrets here.

You know what I
really want to see?

Tell me. Waterfalls.

It's a bit of a trek.

Perfect.

You'll tell me about all
the secrets on the way.

Or instead we can go to
my friend's lake house.

I bet you like jet ski.

Hike in the woods
sounds perfect.

What's up? There is no

(FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING)

Hakim, tell me. What?

On my way here,

people were staring at
me like I was a ghost.

I'm sure I'm not the
first blonde woman

they've ever seen? No,
it's not about that.

What is it then?

You don't wanna know. Try me.

Well, not too long ago,

two Scandinavian girls
that looked like you

were killed while they
were camping near here.

The killers were local, known
to have extremist views.

Everybody was shocked.

So what happened? (SIGHS)

Those bastards filmed the
murders, dropped it online,

and, uh, it was embarrassing
for the whole country.

Did you see it? What? No!

I want to go there. Go where?

Where they were killed.

Why? It's just...
I just do, please.

Whatever. It's on
the way anyway.

PAXTON: Hey, you
ready? As I'll ever be.

He's in his office waiting.

PAXTON: How are the kids?
BOURDEAU: Great. Yours?

PAXTON: Expensive.

So, we got just the Director?

Got to warn you, Ross
might be there today.

BOURDEAU: Ah, great.

Yeah, he's always in a
particular mood, isn't he?

Yup, he is. Yeah.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
DIRECTOR: Come in.

Sir. Agent Ross.

What do you have
for me, Bourdeau?

I've got a blonde and
beautiful bombshell

pretending to be a blogger.

I got a long list of
grisly, unsolved murders,

all men, all misogynists,
who all end up dead

in all the places
that she visits.

Pardon my skepticism, but, um...

h... how many thousands
of travelers happen to be

in the same country
as a murderer?

And you think this is
all the same person?

Not just the same person.

The same woman, Agent Ross.

this is ridiculous.

Wait a second. I know her.

That's Doctor Akula.
Let me check her feed.

Has she even been
to Afghanistan?

Yeah. Four months ago. Why?

My husband works for
Medicines Sans Frontiers.

Four months ago in Afghanistan,

all the men in the
village were poisoned.

This claiming to be from
Doctors without Borders

actually went on TV and
blamed it on the local NGOs

who had been defrauding
the US government

for development
money. So what?

So, when they checked
their records,

there was no Doctor
Akula working

with Doctors without
Borders. Hmm.

(SPEAKS ARABIC)

PAXTON: And you know what else?

Akula isn't even a name.

It's the Russian word for shark.

All right, pardon me again.

I have seen the data of
almost every unsolved

cross-border-related homicide
that this agency has access to.

And I'm gonna say it again

I've never seen anything so
ridiculous in all my life!

Sir, I've been
working on this case

on my own time for months.

Listen Ross, I get that
this is a stress for you

but this one is a hit.

She's actively hunting
down internet trolls

that promote the
murder of women.

This is easy enough to resolve.

Where's your suspect
now? Morocco.

Okay, pardon me.

And this... You're right.
This can be easily resolved.

Morocco has one of the
lowest homicide rates

in the world, right? Average
one-point-four per day.

Let's just see how many murders
have been committed in the area

she's blogging from in
the last, say, 48 hours.

ROSS: See?

One in Casablanca. None
in the mountainous area.

At least none reported
to Rabat headquarters,

which would be highly irregular.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

Okay. Get together
what you have.

I want a full report
in ten minutes.

You got it.

(CELLPHONES CHIMING)

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

(CELLPHONE DINGS)
Sir. Yes, sir.

I'm on my way.

Good morning. Hey. JAWAD: Hey.

What happened? Islamist scum.

They killed Kamal and Nourdine.

Lasri? No, Ayoubi.

Good.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

SELMA: It's pretty
bloody in here.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Any suspects?

After the victims were ID'd,
you were my first suspect.

Well, maybe you should have
me take a polygraph test,

you know just to be sure.

It has to be the
work of Islamists.

Both of them were
not exactly pious,

if you know what I mean.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

Come on.

Anything else you wanna tell me?

You sure?

Swear?

CAPTAIN: <i>Make sure the place
is completely sealed off</i>

and don't touch anything
until the detectives arrive.

Double homicide, huh?

I want you to take
care of the case.

Why? It's Selma.

I understand she is your partner

but given what
happened with the last

and the previous case
involving those two,

I am concerned she may not
be particularly invested

in getting justice
for the victims.

Captain, with all due respect,

I worked that case
alongside her the whole way.

She did everything
by the book and more.

She made sure all
the witness testimony

and the physical evidence
was properly presented

to the court.

It's not her fault if the
judge had more sympathy

with the rapists
than the victims.

She should have known better.

Sir, I promise you,

I will be with her
the entire time.

I have as much confidence in
her as you have in me right now.

She's the best
detective in the region.

If I see anything suggesting
she's not doing her work,

I will let you know.
You have my word.

I admire your loyalty, Jawad.

But if this goes national

I will not hesitate throwing
you both under the bus

if this means the
reputation of our precinct.

Do you understand? Yes, sir.

Interpol is already
on their way.

Interpol, sir? They
are tracking a suspect

who is wanted for
other crimes abroad

whom they believe
to be in the area.

Needless to say,
international interests

will kill us after what
happened last time.

Forgive me if I'm wrong, sir,

but perhaps a little
international attention

is exactly what will bring
us back into good favors.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

MYA: So, what is the
plan for tonight?

Actually, Vance Wilhorn
is organizing a party

and he is a friend of mine.

Isn't he on trial
for raping women?

Ah, he say they're
just gold diggers.

And you know what?
He's not my friend.

I just work for him.

Doing what? Social
media stuff.

You know the lake house
I'm talking about?

Mm-hmm. It's his.

I would love to
meet him. You will.

He is known to get
pretty wild. I heard.

This lake house, is
it far from here?

About one hour by foot.

Our suspect, female Caucasian,
early thirties, Russian descent.

She keeps a
motorcycle-themed travel blog

across several social
media platforms.

She's targeting young men
between the ages of 16 and 30

who are often in
online hate groups

glorifying violence
against women.

She often kills in
the same fashion

as these videos posted online.

I know what you're thinking.

She's probably doing us a favor.

Taking all these
scumbags off the streets,

but the fact remains,
this is a serial killer.

It's making a lot more difficult

to track these
online hate groups.

I believe she's been tracking
a particular Facebook friend

of the recently
deceased, Sam Sandman,

who's sharing videos online of
the two Scandinavian tourists

that were murdered. I'm
sure you remember that.

The gentleman on the
left is Hakim Aouzad,

who's recently
convicted of possessing

pornographic material
and extortion.

It's likely that
that's her next victim.

Do we know any of
her other profiles?

She's currently in Morocco
under the name of Mya Snik.

Incidentally, Mya Snik, in
Russian means "Butcher."

Any others?

There is one alias
that keeps coming up

again and again with
all the alleged victims.

And that is?

BOURDEAU: All of the victims
attributed to the suspect

had images of their own
murders posted online

with this online content.

ROSS: What does the number mean?

We don't know.

Well, looking at where
some of the victims are

it looks more like a country
code or an area code.

Does this mean that
she's just telling us

where she is or that
there is more than one?

BOURDEAU: We can't count
on anything at this point.

Ah, you're gonna
have to... (CHUCKLES)

I just think this all sounds
pretty circumstantial.

The idea of a secret network
of misogynist-hunting,

serial-killing women?

Sounds more like a
paranoid male fantasy

if you ask me.
DIRECTOR: You should see

my ex-wife when
she gets together

with her girlfriends after
a few bottles of wine.

That's exactly my point.

Every one of you in
this room is divorced

and sees your ex as the devil.

I can say for myself
I have wished men dead

many more times
than I can count.

Is that right?

What? It's completely normal!

Men all over the world talk
about killing women everyday

and do they it?

Well, most don't.

Why do you think we would?

Ninety-five percent
of violent crime

is committed by men

and most of that is
against other men.

You should be afraid
of yourselves not us.

You know for once I'm
in complete agreement

with you, Agent Paxton.

This is a complete waste
of the agency's time

and resources.

I want each of you all to
start scouring websites

that promote violence
towards women.

If you find any comments

from moderators
deactivating accounts,

cross-check them with local
homicide investigators.

These people use VPNs that
use VPNs that use VPNs.

This is nonsense!

Bourdeau, book two
flights to Morocco

before I change my mind.

Two flights? DIRECTOR: Yeah.

Yes, sir.

Stay behind Ross.

Are you holding
something back? What? No.

It was just, you
seemed a little...

you seem a little burnt out.

Is it too much
time behind a desk?

Yeah, maybe you're right.

I don't know why you left
the US to come and join us,

but we are really
grateful to have you here.

Well, you know,

analyzing data to help
cops catch criminals

seems a lot more important than

creating algorithms
for short sellers

and hedge fund managers.

Look, Bourdeau can be
a little unorthodox,

so just make sure he
follows protocol, hmm?

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

HAKIM: Do you always
travel alone? Always.

Aren't you afraid?

Not all men are
nice guys like me.

Most men are harmless.

They just like to bark a lot.

Are you a feminist or something?

MYA: (CHUCKLES) Not at all.

HAKIM: Mya, huh? What's
your family name?

Snik.

HAKIM: Is it Danish
or something? Russian.

(FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING)

happened. (SIGHS)

(EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Are you okay?

You look like the

Baba.

Did you hear? Hear what?

Kamal and Nouredine.

No, what about them?

They were found dead.
Murdered in the cafe.

Lasri? SELMA: No. Ayoubi.

Oh, it's not a great loss.

Who did it?

The guy thinks it's Salafists,
but I have my doubts.

And what is your theory?

SELMA: It's not a
theory, it's a feeling.

This woman, this terrorist,
she went into the cafe.

And there was some
sort of argument.

It's not much to go
on, I know, but...

A good cop always
follows his gut.

Remember what happened
when I ignored it?

Two innocent ladies end up dead

and all the nation
wanted me to join them.

SELMA: Baba, you have to stop
blaming yourself for that.

You were made a scapegoat.

Everyone knew the
same thing you did.

And no one would've ever thought

that those sheep
fuckers would've done

something like that.

Doesn't matter.

We knew they were talking
about it for months.

I was the chief of the
police and I didn't act.

I'm sorry. For what?

If it was not for me, you
would be colonel by now.

If it was not for you,

I'd be a fat djellaba
mom with eleven kids

somewhere on a
farm. (CHUCKLES)

Oh, your mother hated me.

I probably killed her.

Sugar and diabetes killed her.

No one would ever say
you're that sweet.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

You expecting someone? No.

Let me go see who it is.

Hey. SELMA: Hi.

How's your dad?

I mean, since he lost his
job, he's not the same.

Hmm. (INHALES DEEPLY)

You don't think it's
Islamists, do you?

I mean even if it's Islamists,

that woman is by herself in
the woods with a stranger

and I just wanna
go check on her.

Yeah, I also thought about
what that kid told you.

I think your instincts
could be right.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Just gonna get
my jacket. Sure.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

MYA: Hakim!

Hakim!

Hakim!

(CELLPHONE RINGING)


Who's that? Hakim? Yes.

You just hung up
on him like that?

Yes.

VANCE: Isn't he your boss? No.

Okay, so what? You just
drive me around for free?

Okay, forgive me, but
you don't strike me

as the charitable type.

Wait, what is he... is
he blackmailing you?


Something like this. Has
video of me doing business.

What kind of business?

None of your business business.

Look, this doesn't
make any sense.

What are you talking about?

Hakim is my bro. He
wouldn't blackmail anyone.

Yes, he would.

He is going to do same
to you. Very soon.

He pay a bitch. Then
he put secret cameras.

And after... he will fuck you.

Fuck!

I'm such a fucking idiot. Yes.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

(CELLPHONE BUZZING) (GRUNTS)

Yo, what are you talking about?

Who?

Yo!

Okay, so I don't understand.
Why don't you just, you know,

in your own special
way, persuade Hakim

to delete the video
that he has of you.

He's not stupid.

He stored the video
in different cloud.

Not his. Maybe yours.

Sneaky little rat.

The cloud.

Did you have admin access?

Yeah.

I told him that he could
handle all of that shit.

Good.

You find my video
and you delete it.

And then... I will delete Hakim.

And why are you
calling me on video?

I lost my phone.

I need help. It's not a joke.

VANCE OVER PHONE: <i>What does it
have to do with the lake house?</i>

I had nowhere else to go.

What the fuck?

Not so fun to be
hunted now, is it?

I don't understand, Mya.

MYA: You have a friend
in Florida, Sam Sandman.

Yeah, he died.

MYA: He took a great pleasure

in sending the
clip of the murder

to their parents.
Their fucking parents.

And he wasn't the only one.

I don't know any of this.
MYA: Of course, you do.

You're the one who
sent him the video

from a website you
own and operate.

HAKIM: No, no, no, no,
it's not my website.

It's Vance's. I mean
I sent the video,

but not to glorify shit.

He... he likes sick things.

I didn't mean anything. Liar!

It's the truth. I manage
a lot of websites.

Some of them are cats
in funny clothes,

accident cars, but
I... I don't own them.

MYA: Your friend
Sandman... (GROANS)

I deactivated him for
violating the terms

of basic human decency.

Wha... what's you mean?

MYA: Our mission is
to eradicate misogyny.

(FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING)

Is that the blogger?

JAWAD: I think it is.

I'm calling for back up. Fine.

SELMA: Supermodel
shows up in town.

Twelve hours later, we
have five dead bodies!

Never seen in history.

MYA: It's just the beginning.

Why here? Why them?

Why this senseless killing?

The girl they raped,
what happened to her?

How do you know about that?

If you knew about the rape,
why were they not arrested?

They were arrested. I
arrested them myself!

MYA: And?

SELMA: And she was known to
go out with men for money.

These men were well
known by the community

and the court sided with them.

What happened to the girl?

She killed herself.

And the other girl?

SELMA: What other girl?
There's no other girl.

There is always another girl.

You know exactly who
I'm talking about.

(SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING)

ROSS: There might
be a complication.

BOURDEAU: What do you mean?

The man in the photos with
your suspect, Hakim Aouzad,

he operates one of the websites

your Doctor Akula
may have been using

to target her alleged victims.
We... we know this already.

It seems he is in the employ
of a much bigger fish.

Vance Wilhorn.

Mr. Wilhorn is wanted for rape
in seven different countries.

"Vacationing" in Morocco

to avoid excessive
media attention

during the trials
according to Page Six.

BOURDEAU: So, what
are you telling me?


What I'm telling you is if
you want to get your girl,

you better move quick.

You don't think the agency
is gonna wanna lose out

on the opportunity to bring in

the world's most beloved
serial rapist, do you?

Just the kind of attention
the Director's looking for

if he's hoping to gain

his next budget's quarters
increases approved.

That's what I love
about you, Ross.

Your passion for justice.

(MOCKING SOUNDS)

What... what's going on?

We've apprehended the suspect.

Wow, looks like you
might be in luck.

One thing I know
about this chick,

she doesn't stay
put for very long.

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

MYA: When did it happen?

The academy... classmate.

And no, I filed a complaint,
but I didn't press charges.

Because... SELMA: Because...

he would have made my
life way more difficult,

and he would have
killed my father.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

I was a stenographer at a
youth court in my country.

Every day, all day, every case.

Rape. Sexual assault.
Aggravated rape.

Aggravated sexual assault.
They were all minors.

Rich. Poor.
Educated. Uneducated.

Always insisting
on their innocence

even when the evidence
was irrefutable.

Ninety percent of all
rapes never get reported.

And those that do don't
even make it to trial.

And aside of their crimes,

they were perfectly normal,
perfectly nice boys.

Not monsters.

Sons any mother
would be proud of.

The worst is that the court
generally felt that way, too.

The laws are designed to
protect male property.

If the victim lived with
her father or was married,

the punishments
were always severe.

If she didn't... (CHUCKLES)
not even a slap on the wrist.

Once I realized
that... (CHUCKLES)

the numbers just started
jumping out at me everywhere.

Ninety percent of
rapists are men.

Eighty percent of
serial killers are men.

Ninety-seven percent of
mass shooters are men.

Ninety-four percent
of pedophiles are men.

Eighty percent of
assaults are by someone

known to the woman.

Family. Friend.
Neighbor. Co-worker.

from your own experience...

classmate.


The law considers you
property of a man.

How can you in clear
conscience respect it

or obey it?

Do you really want
to spend your life

failing to help women?

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

If you want to
make a difference,

join the movement. (GROANS)

Stop!

Stop!

Stop, Anya! Anya
Stoy! (GUNSHOTS)

Do what you have to do.

BOURDEAU: I know what
happened to your friend.

I know they shared those
videos to her family.

I know what you're feeling.

But you can't kill anyone.

You can't take justice
into your own hands.

No!

can't talk about anything.

Just you go with me
that's all I'm asking.

And just...


Okay, please have a seat.

Where is she?

I'm gonna check in
with headquarters.

Officer Battal here
has offered to give us

her official statement.

Of course, I just wanna
get everything on record

while it's still
fresh in my mind.

ROSS: Yeah. So, you said
that Victim 1, Hakim Aouzad,

well, was fatally stabbed
by Victim 2, Moh El Khadr.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Correct.

ROSS: Uh, Hakim Aouzad
was the one responsible

for killing the two
men at the cafe.

Is that correct? Um, yes.

Uh...

And you believe this is why
Mr. Moh murdered Mr. Aouzad?

Yeah, absolutely.

Now, at this point, Mr. Moh...

tried to kill the
missing suspect,

because she was a witness.

Correct? Correct.

ROSS: And at this
point, you intervened?

Yeah. ROSS: Right?

Mr. Moh disarmed you, and
somehow in the struggle,

you broke his neck?

SELMA: Um, the victim was
already quite fatigued

from the fight, um,
with Mr. Aou... Aouzad.

You actually believe this shit?

Will you please... This...
She's not a suspect here.

She's not a suspect.
Really? Are you kidding me?

Are we on the same team here?
ROSS: This is... What...

I can see it in her eyes,
she's covering for her.

Okay, I'm gonna ask
you one more question.

Why did you arrest
her? (SCOFFS)

Have you seen her? She's
a Russian prostitute.

What? Bullshit!

SELMA: It's really hard
for me to admit this,

but I got caught off
guard. She knocked me down.

And by the time I woke
up, she was already gone.

ROSS: Thank you.

We really appreciate you
taking the time for this

and again, I'm very,
very sorry for your loss.

You know there's no way
that you single-handedly

killed that man.

And no, she's not a prostitute.

SELMA: But... She's
a serial killer.

Agent Ross has my
full statement,

Agent Boudoire. It's Bourdeau.

Look, if you'll excuse me,
I had a really long day

and I just lost my partner.

You know she's gonna
kill again, right?

I have no doubt.

(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)

(SELMA CHUCKLES) I don't
know why you're helping her.

She was... Inspiring.

You trying to get
fired or arrested?

Some people, my
partner for example,

are purists.

They believe you
have to do bad things

to make the world
a better place,

everything becomes tainted.

We descend into anarchy.

Bless them... but I
happen to disagree.

Feel free to contact me if I
can be of any further help.

BOURDEAU: What are you
guys talking about?

Tajines.

BOURDEAU: Tajine?

ROSS: You hungry?

I can't wait to try one
of them Moroccan Tajines.

Mrouzia with the ras el hanout
has 20 different spices.

You got your meatball tajine
with the tomato sauce.

You got your fish tajine
with the chermoula

tagra marinade.

Oh, and I can't wait
for the chicken.

Chicken is made with saffron,
and ginger, and garlic,

bit of cinnamon
and, uh, topped off

with a bit of dried
apricots. Mm-mm!

SELMA: Vance?

Samira.

My friends call me "Sam."

Sam? Oh shit.

I have to admit

I wasn't expecting
someone so, uh,

elegant.

Usually, the website curators
I've hired in the past

have been chunky little
nerds (BOTH CHUCKLE)

who couldn't get a girlfriend.

Kind of pathetic type.

So, what happened
with your web curator?

He met a woman. Moved on.

I see. Anybody can find love.

Yeah, I hope so.


You, uh, got someone special?

SELMA: Oh.

Two.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

So, what kind of content
will I be managing?

I don't even know what
kind of business you do.

I'm very versatile.

Versatile, huh? (CHUCKLES)

I like that.

Listen, some of
the content is...

Well, I wouldn't want it
being handled by a woman.

I mean, obviously
you're very qualified,

and professional,
and all of that.

And some of the
websites that I operate,

they... generate
me a lot of money.

But some of the stuff, I... I
can't even look at it myself.

And I just can't
imagine a beautiful

and sophisticated
woman like you...

No.

I'm sorry.

I think I have wasted your time.

(SELMA CHUCKLES)

I think you're being
a little sexist.

I mean, business is business.

And I don't care what
kind of content it is.

I'll help you manage it.
Drive up the traffic.

No.

You don't understand. Some
of it is very extreme.

You know what? Let's
just order another round.

Enjoy the music.

As I said before,
I'm very versatile.

I know a lot of people.

And I'll be more than
happy to help you find...

other opportunities.

Vance. I can call
you Vance, right?

Yeah, of course.
Don't be ridiculous.

This might be a little
personal, but, um...

I like extreme things.
Like, shocking things.

No. It isn't like that.

But I definitely like to
hear more about your...

extreme tastes.

Well... not every villain
is sugar and spice, Vance.

I wanna see it.

Some of it is very violent.

aren't a feminist.

As long as it doesn't
happen to me, I don't care.

VANCE: Do you have
your computer?

No, I didn't think I'd need it.

Do you have yours? Yeah.

Wait. (CHUCKLES)

I thought you said
this was extreme.

I mean, if it's extreme,
don't you think we should

watch it somewhere a
little more private?

Yeah.
