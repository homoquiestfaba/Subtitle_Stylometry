<b>WHO'S DRIVING DOUG</b>

Can you turn
that down a little?

"Why were you
afraid, Lily?" said Jim.

"I was afraid that
you would reject me

"like all the others
do," said Lily.

Then Lily and Jim hug each other

and never let go.

The end.

Good.

That was good.

Comments.

I really felt the bond
between Lily and Jim.

It was very real.

Thank you.

Good.

Anyone else?

Basically, the whole story's
about society's expectations

on love and how we
deal with it and...

Basically, that's it.

That's what I was going for.

Yeah, good, good.

What about you, Doug?

God, that fucking sucked.

The story couldn't
have been any more

contrived and just phony.

And what do you know about
love, you pretentious moron?

Do all your experiences
come from watching sitcoms?

God, it just makes me
wanna, like, ralph!

Doug!
Doug! Doug! Doug!

Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!

Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!
Doug.

Doug?

Everything was said.

Good.

Now, on that note,

I have a special treat
for you folks today:

The final assignment.

We'll pass it around now.

Read it, and I'll answer
questions next class.

I just have
a lot of papers to grade.

I just want to see you more.

When will I see you, then?

Maybe this weekend.

Okay.

Okay. I'll call you, but...

I have to go, okay?

Okay.

Hey! Stephanie!

Hey, Steph.

Hi, Doug.

Hey, how's your...

What's up?

Thank you.

My fiction seminar
was cancelled.

That's too bad.

Hey, I gotta get to class.

I'll roll with you.

Okay. Cool.

So I just
want to let you know

that Wednesday is
gonna be my last day.

Wait, you're quitting?

Yeah, sorry about that.

My boyfriend's band got
this gig in San Fran,

and I'm driving up there
with him on Thursday.

So, yeah.

Doug? Doug.

There you are.

Hi. It's so, God, dark in here.

Did Gretchen even
clean your room yet?

I don't know.

Don't get me started on her.

She is not the brightest
bulb in the box.

How are you, Mom?

Well, I've been
running around all day.

I mean, the florist called.

He was running late.

And then Gretchen broke
another one of my plates

and blames it on the dog.

Right?

I love you, too, Mom.

I'm sorry, honey.

I'm just a little frazzled.

What's going on with your hair?

It's very dusty in here, okay?

And what's the matter?

You seem... pooped?

Janice quit.

Great.

This is not what
I need right now.

I have to get that.

The painter's
supposed to be coming,

and, you know, we're...

Gretchen!

Can you please answer the phone?

Hey, what's up?

How are you doing?

Okay.

I miss you.

Thank you.

Slow it down, Turbo.

Jackass.

Says here you want to be
a video game programmer?

Yeah.

That's... different.

My brother-in-law went
to the same high school.

All right.

Go, Humpbacks!

So, what have you been
doing in the meantime?

I've been pursuing
my associate's degree.

For five years.

Listen, I'm gonna be
honest with you...

Scott.

Scott.

Your academic record is,

well, it's less than stellar.

What?

What about my SAT scores?

Yes.

They're quite good.

But that was high school.

Alright, I admit it, I've
had a rough couple of years.

But I'm ready to
buckle down, you know?

"Seize the moment."

You guys got, like,
financial aid, right?

Like... pretty lucrative
for your students?

I really don't think

that this would be the
right school for you,

but I can offer
you some brochures

to some less
discriminating universities

that would be perfectly
suited for someone like you.

You know what?

Fuck this.

Hey.

Hey, you're looking for
a new driver, right?

Yeah.

You're Doug?

I'm Scott.

Scott Lane.

Hi.

So how many times a week?

Four times a week.

And what, like, nine to...

Who's this?

I'm Scott.

I can start as
early as tomorrow.

Well, if your driving
record checks out.

Great. I'll call you.

Sorry.

I don't like him.

Mom!

Sorry I was late, man.

Being on time's not...

It's not really my thing.

So, what's your major?

Theatre.

Cool.

Sounds like fun.

Be the next Judy Garland?

You know, I was in a play once

in high school, and they
made us dance the Charleston.

It's like the
stupidest dance ever.

You ever had to
dance the Charleston?

You want the radio on?

No.

What are you staring at?

I'm thinking.

Watch the road, please.

Damn.

Where are you from?

Vegas.

Really?

My dad was gonna take me,

but he didn't get the chance.

Is it cool?

Yeah.

It is.

Alright.

This is where you get off.

You need to unlock me.

Press the right button

that's inside the
steering wheel.

Left.

Right.

What'd I just do?

You reset my radio stations.

Are you kidding?

I can't tell if
you're kidding or not.

Well, do you need any
help getting inside?

I'm fine.

I got it from here.

Have a good day at
school, sugarplum!

Hey.

Be right there.

I have to be there.

I don't care.

I'm coming.

"I fucking trusted you,
and this is how you repay me?

"By fucking my
girl?" said Martin.

"I'll show you trust,"
replied Michael angrily.

Then Michael picked up a
hammer and beat Martin's skull

until it was a bloody
mess on the floor.

Then Jane entered
room topless,

with a towel around her waist.

She looked at the
mangled corpse,

then at Michael and said,

"Thank you for
killing that bastard.

"You're a man.

"Let's fuck."

I've gotta go to
French class meet-up tonight.

If you're not
doing anything after,

you wanna practice
some French kissing?

What?

Nevermind.

We still on for a study
sesh Saturday night?

Sure.

Doug. Listen, man.

We got a problem.

Stephanie, this is Scott.

-Hi.
-Hi.

I'm Stephanie.

Look, man.

Something's come up, and
I've gotta go to Vegas.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, it's like
a personal family thing

I gotta take care of.

Yeah, don't worry about it.

I'll find someone to take over.

I don't really have a car.

So, remember how
you were saying that

you wanna go to Vegas?

I could drive you there.

Show you around.

It'll be such a good time.

I don't know.

Come on, Doug.

You're always
talking about Vegas.

I just met you.

Doug, I know
you don't know me,

and I know this is,
like, a huge favor,

but please, this would
really help me out.

And I'll go with you.

There's plenty
of room in the van.

It'll be a party.

I'll have to think about it.

You gotta think about it.

He's gotta think about it.

Okay. Think about it.

Bye, Stephanie.

Thanks for walking with me.

See ya.

Alright, captain.

Come on, let's get you home.

I don't trust this
Scott character.

I just... I wanna
see Vegas before I die.

Dad would let me go.

Don't be so dramatic.

And no, your father would
not allow you to run off

to Las Vegas with
a total stranger!

Honey, if you want to
go, we'll set a trip up.

Okay?

We'll see the Hoover Dam.

I don't want to
go to Vegas with my mom.

I'm not a child.

And you said yourself
I need to get out more.

What? This is different.

This is not going to the mall.

This is Las Vegas.

I mean, what are you
gonna do there, anyway?

I mean, this place is not
made for someone like you.

Trust me.

It's just... It's
not, it's not g...

It's, it's settled.

We'll be having
chicken again tonight.

I hope that's okay with you.

So the schedule

this year, that's why
so many say yes #9,

yes worthy of being
a top 10 team,

but without a signature
non-conference game

and playing that schedule,
what can we make?

Yeah?

Yo, Scott.

Hey, Doug.

What's up?

Hey, do you still
need a ride to Vegas?

Yeah, yeah, I do.

Great. I'm down.

Thanks, man.

Dude, we're gonna
have so much fun.

Like, Stephanie's
gonna be thrilled.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Many species of tortoises
are sexually dimorphic,

that the differences
between males and females

vary from species to species.

Doug?

Do you want to eat
with me tonight?

I have plans.

In some species,
males have a longer,

more protruding neck length.

You fucking bastard.

You said you wouldn't leave me.

You said you would
never leave me.

I should flush you
down the toilet.

That's what I should do.

I should flush you
right down the toilet.

Gretchen!

Can you please
come clean this up?

I can't believe
your mom's letting you do this.

Yeah.

Me neither.

So, if you
don't mind me asking...

You want to
ask about my disability.

I really don't talk about it.

Are you a virgin?

I have osteodystrophy.

Actually, I have a rare,

non-progressive form of it.

So you're saying
you're a virgin.

Non-progressive, so...

It doesn't get worse.

Mhmm.

Sounds like you
got lucky, to me.

Well, I actually
don't know what it is.

I'm one of the few
people that has it.

It's extremely rare.

Were you born with it?

Yup.

You know, if you want, you
can ask something about me.

Why would I want to
ask something about you?

You're normal.

This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever said about me.

Hey, it's Stephanie.

Just in the van.
So...

What's going on
with your family?

Man, it's not really
a family thing.

It's more of a friend
who's like family.

I don't know, it's complicated.

What's up with your family?

What's your dad do?

My dad is dead.

Call me back
when you get this, I guess.

I love you.

Bye.

What are you guys talking about?

Manly things.

Beards and chainsaws
and penises and such.

Okay, nevermind.

Doug.

Doug.

Hey.

Wake up.

I miss the pool.

You can swim?

I could float.

I can even walk around
the shallow end a little.

Just less gravity
under the water.

You did this as a kid?

I used to spend hours
and hours in the pool,

until my hands got all
wrinkly.

I just felt so free.

Hey, you know, the hotel
we're going to will have a pool.

We can... We can go for a swim.

I'll help you out.

I haven't been able to do that

for a very long time.

Hey, are you guys hungry?

Yeah, I think I could eat.

What about you?

Yeah.

There you go, hun.

Hi, guys.

What can I get ya?

I'll get the
number three, please.

I'll have the
Big Texas burger.

And what can I get for him?

I don't know, Ethel.

Why don't you ask him?

Can I get a number
one with extra bacon?

Okay, a number one, no bacon.

Can I get extra bacon?

Right.

Number one, no bacon.

He wants extra bacon.

And a round of waters, please.

Thank you.

Must get annoying?

It happens all the time.

Well, this burger
tastes like shit.

You alright?

Sorry.

Can you... Can you
cut it up for me?

Yeah, sure thing, man.

Thank you.

No worries.

You're a natural.

Cut a thing or two in my life.

When's the last time
you washed your hands?

Relax.

I haven't masturbated
since this morning.

And on that note, I'm
gonna go make a phone call.

I have to stay proactive
on not getting sick.

I can't cough up mucus so well.

My lungs can fill up.

Mucus and lung fluid.

Thanks for sharing.

heard from you.

Call me back when you get this.

Or text me or something.

Jesus, this knife is terrible.

Hey, Ethel?

Can we get a new
knife over here?

Particularly one
that... cuts things?

Thank you!

Can you not make a
big deal out of it?

I'm just trying to
help you out, man.

I don't need your help.

I just want to be treated
like everyone else.

No, you don't.

You love being treated special.

So what, when someone
holds a door open for you,

they're treating you like a kid?

And when they don't,
they're an asshole?

Is that how it works?

And at the same time, you
claim you want to be treated

like everyone else, but
what you fail to realize

is that the longer you focus
on trying to be normal,

the longer it's gonna
take you to realize

that nobody's normal, Doug.

How's that?

Thank you.

Stop thanking me all the time.

You're sucking all
the fun out of it.

What'd I miss?

Can't divulge that
information, ma'am.

It's a government secret thing.

We told you, we'd
have to kill ya.

And Doug doesn't wanna have to do that.
Look at him.

Actually, I believe there's
an implied priv clause

regarding Las Vegas.

You know what they say.

I'm sorry, what do they say?

"What happens in
Vegas, stays in Vegas."

Who the hell says that?

It's a saying.

From who?

People. People say that.

I've lived in Vegas for years,
and I've never heard that.

Seriously?

Fuck you.

So, who you out there calling?

My boyfriend.

He wasn't answering, though.

Boyfriend?

Sounds serious.

Yeah, it's getting
pretty serious.

He's a professor.

And the plot thickens.

So, why pray tell, are you
making study dates with Doug

if you're already
doing the professor?

Doesn't that, like,
guarantee a passing grade?

It's not like that.

He's a great guy.

I heard he sleeps with
a lot of his students.

He doesn't do that anymore.

So, what do you call a
quadriplegic on a barbecue grill?

Frank.

Alright, alright.

What do you call a
quadriplegic under your car?

Jack.

Come on, man.

Those are funny.

I laughed.

You didn't even smile.

You never smile.

Maybe I don't want to.

Bullshit.

I can't smile.

These muscles in
my face don't work.

Or something.

I guess it's just
an added bonus.

That's not true.

I've seen you smile.

You use your eyes.

You just don't do it that often.

Maybe I don't have
anything to smile about.

My God.

What is happening?

What are you doing?

Just having a little fun.

Slow down, stranger.

Not a chance.

Say it with me, Doug.

Woo!

Woo!

Woo!

You guys are fucking insane!

That was not cool.

What's happening?

You okay?

You need some water?

Scott, pull over!

What do I do?

I don't know.

I've never seen him this bad.

Hit his back or
something, I don't know.

Doug!

Doug!

I'm okay.

Just give me a minute.

My God.

I was gonna call 911.

Damn it, Doug.

You scared the shit
out of me, man.

I'm fine.

Let's keep going.

That was terrifying.

You okay?

I'm fine.

Just freaked me out a little.

Come on. Let's go.

Look at you.
Look at you.

You're beautiful.

Hey, come here.

Come here.

Take a picture.

Come on, I got it set up.

Shit, I got it on video.

Hold on.

Alright.

Say "cheese."

Are we there yet?

See that sign over there?

Yeah.

A friend and I stayed out
all night once by that sign,

just waiting for a ride.

Why didn't you
stay at a hotel?

Didn't have any money.

That must've sucked.

Actually, it was one of
the best nights of my life.

It's calm here.

I've never
seen anything like this.

There's so many people.

This is amazing.

Check it out.

We're here.

It's cool?

This is crazy.

I wanna gamble.

Slow your roll, buddy.

Let's check out the hotel first.

That place looks nice.

No, we can't stay there.

I know a place that's
a little better suited

for our price range.

Where'd you hear
that Julian sleeps

with a lot of students?

I thought you knew.

Jesus, what do you got
in here, a dead body?

Just books.

Doug and I are supposed
to study this weekend.

So, should we meet back
here in a few hours?

You ditching us already?

I've just been
stewing in your juices

for the last six hours.

I could use a shower.

Scott, why don't you show
me those cardshark skills?

Pace yourself, captain.

Let's check out our room first.

There's plenty of time
to spend your money.

Great. Well, see
you in a few hours.

Yes, Mom.

Yes.

I'm fine, Mom.

Unacceptable, Doug!

We agreed you would not be
going to that awful place!

We didn't agree.

Where are you?
I am going to get you.

No, Mom.

I just got here.

Well, are you at
least eating enough?

Yes, Mom.

The hotel clean?

It's fine.

Do you need anything?

No.

You know, the dog
got under the fence

and into the
neighbor's yard today.

Great.

When are you coming home?

I just got here.

I'll be home in
a couple of days.

I gotta go, Mom.

Wait. Okay, well...

Call us later.

I love you.

I love
you, too, Douglas.

What's that stain on the bed?

Don't worry.

That doesn't look like blood.

It looks like semen.

Good luck with that.

It's your bed.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I'm great.

We've got some time to kill.

You wanna go see your friend?

No.

I can take of that later.

I need a drink.

Let's roll.

You ever play blackjack?

On my phone.

That's good enough for me.
Let's do it.

Okay.

Here, do you see this?

It's ridiculous.

Hey, cutie.

Hey.
What's the minimum?

$10.

$10.

You good with that?

Yeah.

Alright.

I think you should...

Yeah.

Please. Yeah.

Just go ahead.

-Stay.
-Definitely stay.

20, 20.

That's fucking sick.

Bust, again.

Yes!

This guy's getting
all the good cards.

With a face like that,

you should go over
to the poker table.

He's mad 'cause he's losing.

Place your bets.

No more bets.

33, black.

Alright, what else?

The rest, and then
stuck on two to one.

The whole thing?

Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah!

Place your bets.

Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

Wait, nevermind.

My God.

Yes!

-You sure?
-Yeah!

Okay. Alright.

No more bets.

No more bets, please.

-Green, zero!
-Yeah! Yes!

Here we go, here
we go, here we go.

11, yes!

Did you see that?

Look at that.

Come on, come on.

Excuse me, sir.

Yeah.

Is he 21?

Of course.

Could you please
show me some ID?

Yeah.

It's in your
pocket, right, Doug?

Yeah, back pocket.

He's pretty heavy.

If you maybe get his feet,
help me flip him over,

we get it out.

No, that
won't be necessary.

I'm terribly sorry.

He looks young for his age.

You have a nice day.

You know, you could've
just shown him my ID.

Yeah, but that wouldn't
have been as much fun.

Refills! Hell yeah!

Sorry, it's his first time.

Wait, wait, wait.
That's for you.

Can I get a straw?

I think she wants the D, Doug.

She's into you.

Sure.

Right.

Onward.

Where to next?

Wherever you want to go, man.

Should we go
pick up Stephanie?

Yeah, let's head back.

You know what?

I had a lot of fun with you.

Thank you.

Good.

I did, too.

Especially 'cause
you're gonna give me

a cut of your winnings.

That's what you think.

Come on. 30%.

25%.

10%?

Good luck with that.

Dick.

Import prices took
their sharpest plunge

in over eight years in March.

As costs of both imported
petroleum and non-petroleum...

It's okay to be fat

How do I look?

You look so good, I
could dip you in butter

and sop you up with a biscuit.

So, what do you
guys wanna go do?

Whatever.

What do you think, Doug?

I don't care.

I know a good
bar we could go to.

I'm ready.

Not looking like
that, you're not.

This is all I got.

Are glasses really necessary?

No, you look good.

Like, Rollercop.

I look stupid.

I think you look great.

Let's go.

Come on, maverick!

Let's go dance!

What am I gonna do?

Come dance!

Come dance.

Try and have fun, Doug.

Come on!

Let's see
your moves, Doug.

Thanks
a lot, you guys.

Thanks for coming
'round to this place.

What's up, man?

Where's Stephanie?

Inside.

Come on, man.

What's wrong?

I just have a headache.

I got something that'll
make you feel better.

No.

No, no, no.

I... No, no thank you.

You ever tried it?

No.

I don't do drugs.

Come on, you take
like 15 pills a day.

It's just weed.

It's not like a cigarette with
a bunch of bullshit in it.

It's a plant.
It's like cilantro.

But it gets you high.

There's no way you're gonna
convince me to smoke pot.

When I was a kid,

I used to think
drinking and driving

meant drinking
anything and driving.

So when I saw my dad
drinking coffee and driving,

I was like, "My God,
what are you doing?"

Eagle Scout Doug
saves the day.

Eagle Scout. Right.

When I was in elementary school,

there was this huge
hill by the playground.

It probably wasn't that steep,

but when you're a
little kid, you know?

So I had one of my friends
push me to the top of the hill.

And I would just

let go of the brakes and fly.

You know, I probably
could've killed myself,

but it was just so much fun.

What time is it?

Who cares?

Thank you.

For this stuff.

Anytime, man.

You wanna trade?

This is for concentration.

But it gives you a
pretty good buzz, too.

You're kidding me, right?

I feel fucking amazing.

Doug, I need to
use your phone.

Mine's dead.

Thanks.

Hello?

Hi.

I didn't think you'd be awake.

Hi.

Now's not really a good time.

It's two in the morning.

What's going on?

Nothing.

I have to go, okay?

I'll talk to you later.

Who's on the phone?

Hey, Scott.

Shit, took you long enough.

Busy night, stud?

Doug, Elation.

Elation, Doug.

So this is him?

Hey, baby.

I got you some
entertainment, buddy.

Don't worry, man.

Elation's all class.

Doug, are you okay with this?

He's fine.

Let's give him some alone time.

Have fun, stud-muffin.

Hey.

Hi.

Do you wanna come over
here a little closer,

so I can see you?

This is not okay, Scott.

He could get hurt
or catch something.

Relax.

Elation's a pro.

Doug needs someone
to take care of him.

That clearly is not you.

Maybe you could stop
treating him like a child.

You're so irresponsible.

I'm irresponsible?

You're the one fucking
your 50-year-old professor.

Yeah.

That's right.

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey.

So, what do you like?

I...

I like movies.

That's not what
I meant, darling.

Come here.

No don't.

Let's just...

Why don't I help?

Sure.

Is that okay?

Yeah.

Kinky, baby.

Well, at least your dick works.

This is my...

My first time.

That not okay?

No one has ever
touched me like that.

I think there should be a
first time for everything.

Don't you?

Now, I'm gonna make
your first time

very, very special.

I said, "Aren't they, Doug?"

Doug.

Scramble my fucking eggs,
you wild stallion!

Hey, Doug.

I need a new plate.

I should probably
go help him out.

Hey.

Let me get that for you.

I can manage.

I said I fucking got it!

Aren't you supposed to see
your friend today or something?

Isn't that why we're here?

I don't know.

I gotta... call
and figure it out.

Call who?

My friend.

I'm onto you.

Yeah?

I know what you're hiding.

Why haven't I seen this friend?

Does he even have a name?

Whatever.

I don't care.

It's cool, man.

What the hell are
you talking about?

It's your dealer, isn't it?

Yeah, Doug.

I drove five hours across
state lines to buy a dime bag.

Get some food in your system.

I'm not hungry.

No, I'm having a wonderful time.

Really?

Because you sound kind of sad.

I'm fine.

When are you coming home?

Probably tomorrow.

I miss you, honey.

I miss you, too, Mom.

I gotta go.

I'll talk to you later.

I did not give him
permission to go.

What are you gonna do?

You certainly can't stop him.

So, what do you
want to do now?

Where's Stephanie?

I don't know.

You wanna go play blackjack?

Nope.

You wanna go get a drink?

No.

What's your problem, man?

What's my problem?

You're my fucking problem!

You selfish asshole!

Are you really that thick?

Doug?

Doug.

I wanna go play some games.

Can you open the
door for me, please?

You want me to come with you?

No.

Are you sure?

What, you've never seen
a drunk cripple gamble

his Medicare away?

Sure thing.

Sorry, buddy.

Easy come, easy go.

Doug?

Where have you been all day?

Make your bets.

I've been here
and there and...

mostly here.

And I want you to
meet my friend...

Where's Scott?

I don't know.

Come on.

Let's go.

Save my spot.

Sure thing.

I'll be in my room.

Scott!

Scott!

What the hell?

Hey.

Roll down the window!

What?

What are you doing?

Taking my medicine.

You want some?

No.

What's wrong with you?

Nothing.

Stephanie wanted
me to talk to you.

Stay the fuck out of it, okay?

You want me to stay
out of your life?

Look who's talking, asshole.

What?

You go and you take
away the one thing from me

that I really wanted.

Are you kidding me?

I don't need this
right now, man.

I got bigger problems
to deal with.

I got problems, too.

Yeah, you're in a wheelchair.

We get it.

You're the only one in the
world whose life isn't perfect.

Fuck you!

You come into my
life out of nowhere.

You convince me to
come to this place

for a friend of yours,
who as far as I can tell,

doesn't exist.

And now, you're moving
in on my personal life.

I care about Stephanie.

I don't need this.

I don't need you.

I don't even know you.

Then get the
fuck away from me.

Get the fuck away
from me, goddammit!

Where's he going?

What happened?

We got into a fight.

What?

What did you guys fight about?

You!

Me? What?

Why would you fight about me?

You honestly don't know?

First, you sleep
with my professor,

then you sleep with my driver.

Is there anyone you're not
sleeping with other than me?

Doug.

Doug?

Hey, Doug.

Should I call someone?

I... I need an ambulance.

Everything's gonna be okay.

The sirens.

What's that?

Can you turn on the sirens?

What are his vitals?

BP 140/100.

Respiration, 32.

Pulse, 118.

Doors! Doors!

Get him in, get
him in, get him in.

I need you to wait outside.

O2 sat,
92 and dropping.

Ready?

One, two, three.

Hi.

He's out pretty cold right now.

What's wrong with him?

Pneumonia.

But it's very common in
these neuromuscular cases.

Excuse me.

Hey.

What are you doing here?

I'm here with Doug.

Is that your friend?

Yeah.

Yeah, that's Kevin.

Is, is Kevin your...

Are you...

I'm sorry.

Scott, I get it.

It's okay.

What's wrong with Doug?

Is everything okay?

The doctor said
that he has pneumonia,

and that it's common
with his condition.

I am such a shitty friend.

I don't think there's
anything you could've done.

This happens to him a lot.

He told me about the fight,

and that it was my fault.

No.

It was my fault.

How's Kevin?

I should've been
here earlier, but

his family's here.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

What's going on?

His...

His lungs.

Hey.

Hey, Doug.

Hey.

How are you feeling?

Couldn't be better.

More battle scars.

Some trip?

You must've had some fun, right?

Scott showed you how
to play blackjack,

you got lucky with a lady.

He was determined
to get me to have fun.

No one else even looks at me.

I see you.

I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

I thought about what you
said, and you were right

when it comes to
my relationships.

Where is Scott?

He's here.

I found him last
night at the ICU,

visiting his friend Kevin.

When I left, he'd
fallen asleep in a chair

outside his hospital room.

Doug, did you know
that Scott was...

What?

I think Kevin is more
than just a friend.

Doug!

My God, honey.
Are you okay?

I'm fine.

I'm so glad you're alright.

Stephanie called me.

Mom, I'm okay.

It's just pneumonia.

God.

I knew this would happen.

I knew it.

I never should've let you come.

What kind of mother am I?

And you, young lady, I
expected more from you.

I'll leave the
two of you alone.

I thank you for calling.

I'm fine.

You don't look fine.

You look so pale.

Are they feeding you?

-Please, I'm fine.
-You shouldn't be

in your chair, you
should be resting

so the infection
doesn't get worse.

I'm fine.

Look, this is empty!

Nurse!

Mom, don't.

God.

Excuse me!

Can I help you with something?

Yes.

Fill this.

What are you doing out of bed?

Come on.

Mom!

Stop treating me like I'm
a goddamn cripple child.

Dad's dead, not me.

I'm just worried about you.

I'm worried about you,

but I don't treat you

like a goddamn crazy person.

Go home, Mom.

He was here.

How's Kevin?

I'm so sorry.

Where's Scott?

The friend that was with him.

He left earlier.

Thanks.

Come on.

Look at you.

Look at you.

You're beautiful.

Hey, come here.

Come here.

Take a picture.

Come on, I got it set up.

Alright, you ready?

Smile.

Smile.

There you go, smiling.

Alright, say "cheese."

Say "cheese."

Cheese.

Shit, I got it on video.

Hold on, hold on.

There he is!

By the sign!

Pull the van over.

Hey, wait.

I should talk to him.

He's my friend.

Okay, I'll wait here.

Scott.

What are you doing here?

What?

What are you doing here?

Going.

Going?

Going where?

The hell do you want, Doug?

I wanna talk to you.

I don't.

I'm sorry about what I said.

That's nice to hear.

He wouldn't let me see him.

He wouldn't let me see him,

'cause he didn't want to
die with his family thinking

he was a faggot.

Guess he got his wish.

Do you have any idea
how that feels, Doug?

No.

Scott.

You don't even know me!

I don't even know me!

I'm not a good person, Doug.

I used you!

That's what kind of person I am.

That's why I don't
have any real friends!

Stay away from
people like me, Doug!

My God!

Stephanie!

Scott!

God.

No, no, no, no.

My God.

My God.

My God.

No, no...

Hey, Mom.

Yeah, honey, what's up?

We really need to
get rid of that thing.

No, no, no.

I'm, too busy now, honey.

I have too much going on.

I mean, even today, you know.

I have yoga, and then I
have lunch with Gwyneth

in Santa Monica.

Do you know how hard it
is to park over there?

Then I have to go to
the wallpaper store...

Mom, it's time to move on.

I am not going to
throw your father away.

We're doing fine without him.

It's been almost a year.

We need to do this.

That isn't Dad.

It's just ash.

We could take him to the beach.

We met at the beach.

When I saw him coming
out of the ocean,

I knew right away.

Dad loved you.

He used to take
you to the pool.

Yeah, I remember.

He was so handsome
in his little shorts.

Bye, Dad.

The tortoise
spends most of its life

slowly and quietly
wandering the desert.

Some go their entire lives

without even seeing
another one of their kind.

In a lot of ways,

I can relate to this.

We both spend a
lot of time alone.

We both would be in trouble
if flipped on our backs.

We both have shells.

The difference is

I've chosen to be
trapped inside my shell.

For so long,

I thought it was my illness

that was closing me
off to this world.

I started to see myself

as others saw me:

disabled and powerless.

My best friend

once told me

that I liked being
treated special,

and he was right.

By showing me myself,

he drove me to be better.

He also taught me to
open up to this world.

So, to this world I say,

"Fuck this.

"Fuck my lame body.

"I refuse to be bound by it.

"Fuck close-minded people.

"I refuse to be defined by them.

"And I refuse to wander

"quiet and desperate

"in the desert."

Thank you.
