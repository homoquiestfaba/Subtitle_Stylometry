guarded by a ravenous beast,
my greatest treasure.

Well, I gotta admit it.

Whoa.

Well, I gotta admit it.

We have to do it.

Well, I gotta admit it.

Sorry, kid.

You're sounding like a real
old man right now.

Well, I gotta admit it.

What if you woke up tomorrow and
the white whale was here?

Well, I gotta admit it.

Yeah, that would be nice,
but it just can't be done.

You realize you just stole
something, right?

Wait, was that there before?

So?

You're just angry because I had
the guts to try something

Wait, was that there before?

impossible, and you were too
scared.

Wait, was that there before?

Oh, pfft, I'm not scared.

Wait, was that there before?

That's ridiculous.

Wait, was that there before?

Ugh,
I can't believe that guy,

Wait, was that there before?

the nerve to fire me.

Wait, was that there before?

So ungrateful,
and he thinks I'm reckless?

Wait, was that there before?

Well, how about I just keep this
lamp and then he goes to jail?

Wait, was that there before?

[whimpering]

Wait, was that there before?

All right, I'll return it so
he doesn't get in trouble.

good lesson.

I can't believe you killed my--
huh?
