Man: I'm not very interested
in my school days

and feel no special
nostalgia for them.

But I remember Sixth Form.

Good morning.

And welcome to you all

as we begin the new term.

Man: In those days,
we imagined ourselves

as being in a holding pen,

waiting to be released
into our lives.

Headmaster:
From summer to autumn.

So, too, do we think ahead...

Rather him than us.

Man:
And when that moment would come,

we would be at university.

(upbeat music playing)

(indistinct chattering)

How were we to know that
our lives had already begun,

and our release would only be
into a larger holding pen?

And in time,
a larger holding pen.

When you are young,
you want your emotions

to be like the ones
you read about in books.

You want them
to overturn your life

and create a new reality.

(alarm clock ringing)
But as that second hand

insists on speeding up
and time delivers us all too quickly

into middle age,
and then old age,

that's when you want something
a little milder, don't you?

You want your emotions
to support your life

as it has become.

You want them to tell you
that everything is going to be okay.

And is there anything
wrong with that?

(classical music playing)

"Sir, according to
your recent survey,

95% of British motorists

describe themselves
as 'above average' drivers.

But by the law of averages,

we are, most of us,
bound to be average.

Are we not?

Anthony Webster, London.â€œ

(exhales deeply)
Good timing.

Sorry?

(device beeping)

Oh, uh, sign there, thanks.

Lovely morning, isn't it?
Hmm.

(device beeps)
Thank you.

(music playing)

(knocks on door)

Can I help you?
Just looking.

By all means.
Oh! Wow.

These are beautiful.

How much is this one?

Â£2,399.

Â£2,000?

Extremely rare model.

Still works, huh?
Of course.

How do you source them
on the Internet?

I've been in the Leica business
for some time,

so we have our own
exclusive sources.

"We"?
It's just you, isn't it?

If there's anything
you're particularly interested in,

I may be able to help you.

Do you have anything cheaper?

Some Leica Ills, 500.

500?

Wow.

These are the finest
cameras ever made.

People buy them
because they love them.

Well, as they say,

I'd be rich
if I didn't have kids.

You got kids?

Excuse me?
I've got two baby girls.

I have a daughter.
Oh.

Fathers and daughters, eh?
Very special.

Okay.

(inhales sharply)

Well, I'll look you up
when the kids have left home.

Tony Webster.

Have a lovely day, Tony Webster.
Okay.

(cell phone chiming)

(cell phone beeps)

Hello, Margaret.
I'm calling to remind you that

this evening you're duty bound
to attend the NCT

with your beloved daughter.

Tonight?

Uh, oh, no, no, no, sorry.
No can do.

Oh, for God's sake.
This should be in your diary.

Susie's relying on you.

You know I can'! Do it
with this thing on my leg.

I'm winding you up.

Somebody's in a playful mood.

Always.

Well, don't forget to dig out
something loose-fitting.

Lycra. All-in-one.

Very attractive.

What are you doing this evening?

Working. What else?

Really?

So I'm expecting a full report
in the morning.

How's the foot, by the way?
Bye, Tony.

(call disconnects)
Hmm, charming.

(cell phone beeps)

(car lock beeps)
(intercom buzzes)

Woman: Hi.
It's me.

You're not Mum.

Indeed, I'm not.
Your mother sent me.

I'm your geriatric knight
in shining armor.

Can you give me a minute?
Can I come in?

(door buzzes)
Thank you.

Man on radio: The Prime Minister
has insisted Britain will be safer

and economically stronger
if it remains in the European Union.

He said a vote to leave
would cause such instability

on the financial markets

that the UK could be
tipped back into recession.

(turns off radio)

All right, Dad, let's do this.
Have you seen this?

I know, I know.

It's the bollocking upstairs neighbor.

What happened?
I don't know.

Overflowing bath or something.

That's ridiculous.
I know.

Come on.

I'll write to them.

Dad, no one writes letters anymore.

So, I should probably warn you,
tonight will likely feature lesbians.

(Tony laughs)

I've known quite a number
of lesbians in my time,

thank you very much.

Artificially inseminated lesbians.

a pasteurized lesbian.

Just try not to say anything
too mental, will you?

The woman who runs the group
takes the whole thing

pretty seriously.
(sarcastic laugh)

I'm sure she does.

(Susie sighs)

Hi, I'm Tony.
I'm this evening's stand-in mother.

Standing in for
the mother of the mother.

You just rock with it.
And you will get a rhythm.

But, uh, not to worry.
I have been effectively sterilized.

But the voice
of experience tonight.

Now the contraction comes.

So... sit up.

Your contraction's coming.

Hi, I'm Susie.
Uh, this is my first.

Um, I'm expecting a boy in October.

Instructor:
You're in the arms of your protector

and your baby,
it is going to be fine.

And I think I'm gonna
name him Joshua.

Instructor: Oh!
Really?

Yeah.

Instructor:
We've got another surge that has started.

(bone cracks)
So...

You okay there, Dad?

So maybe if you come further down.

That's it.

See, this is the other thing.

Depends if your partner's agile
or not agile,

you know,
or to get into positions.

It's taking them
into consideration as well

and make whatever's comfortable
for the both of you.

(indistinct conversations)

Me, as well.
Yes.

It was amazing.
And so much fun.

Wait here a sec.
I wanna give you something.

Oh, all right.

Susie:
Oh. (Chuckles)


Man on radio: There has,
and continues to be criticism

of the government's approach
to rebuilding Britain's economy.

And we're better placed
to withstand

an ideological drive
to shrink the state,

with some of the most vulnerable people
in society paying the price.

Woman on radio: A charge that
the ministers would of course, reject?

Man on radio: Yeah, sure,
they'd insist the tough measures

they're taking will ensure Britain's
finances get back onto an even keel.

And we're better placed to
withstand any economic shocks

that may come our way
in the future.

Woman on radio:
Economic shocks such as, for instance...

(frying pan sizzling)


Whoops.

Susie: Here.
What's this?

Time to join the 21 st century.

Not least because I'm about to burst
and Mum's an invalid.

You're my only hope.
(laughs)

Bye, Dad.
Bye.

(engine starts)

(indistinct chatter on radio)

(music playing)

(knuckles cracking)

(printer whirring)

(computer chimes)

(printer scanning)

(clock dings, ticking)

(man whistling)


Oh, good morning.

Just about.

Um... right.
Let me get that...

82...
(device beeping)

Uh, and then you need to...

No. Oh, sorry. There.

Right.
Thanks.

All right.
Have a nice...

Woman: "Dear, Tony, I think it right
that you should have the attached.

Adrian always
spoke warmly of you,

and perhaps you'll find it
an interesting, if painful,

memento of long ago.

I am also leaving you
some money.

You may find this a bit strange,

and, to tell you the truth,
I'm not entirely sure

what my own motives are,

but I wish you well,
even from beyond the grave.

Yours, Sarah Ford.

P.S., it may sound a little odd,

but I think the last months
of his life were happy.â€œ

Woman:
Mr. Webster?

"Dear, Tony, I think it right
you should have the attached.

Adrian always
spoke warmly of you,

and perhaps you will find it
an interesting, if painful,

memento of long ago."
We do not currently...

So it is this attached item referred to,
which is the missing item.

We do not currently have
the second item in our possession.

Excuse me?

I said, we do not currently have
the second item in our possession.

Well, where on earth is it?

The item is currently
with Mrs. Ford's executor.

Mrs. Ford's daughter.

Veronica?
Mm.

You've asked for it, I assume?
That's correct.

Has she given any reason
for withholding it?

I'm afraid I don't know.

Forgive me,
but what do you know?

What is it?
Have you actually seen it?

No, I haven't. Um...

I can look it up for you,
if you wish.

Please do.

(keyboard clacking)

So, Mrs. Ford's will
describes the second item...

as a diary.
A diary?

Belonging to Mrs. Ford?

I'm afraid that's not clear.

Can you let me have
Veronica's address, please?

I'm sorry, we can't give out clients'
addresses without their permission.

Veronica and I know one another.

Well, did know one another,
albeit rather a long time ago.

I'm afraid I would need
her authority to do that.

Well, will you kindly request
that authority, please?

Very well.

Thank you.
Thank you.

It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Webster.

Good-bye.

And you should know
that my ex-wife is a QC.

(indistinct chattering)
(music playing)

Yeah, this all seems fine.

So, she has it, the diary.
That much at least we do know.

Sorry, who has it?

You know, those things
are really bad for you.

They just build up excess mucus.

I'm sorry, Dr. Webster,

didn't think we were here
to discuss my bread-stick intake.

All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.

Feel better once we've eaten.

Once we've ordered. Ah.

Thank God.

Sir, Madam?
I'd like the Carbonara, please.

Mm, <i>Penne Con Salsa
Di Pomodoro E Basilico.</i>

Thank you.

What?
Tell me, tell me.

(rock music playing)

<i>â™ª I feel depressed, I feel so bad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause you're the best girl
that I've ever had â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't get your love,
I can't get affection â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, little girl,
psychotic reaction â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it feels like this... â™ª</i>

(camera clicking)

Not enjoying the party?

It's not really my cup of tea.

I'm a manic depressive, you see.

Not another one.

Clifton Suspension Bridge.
My mind's made up.

Done.

Mm.

Well...

it was nice to meet you.

. TOW-
. TOW-

<i>â™ª Oh, little girl, would you like
to take a ride now? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't get your love,
I can't get satisfaction â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, little girl,
psychotic reaction â™ª</i>

(car passing)

(horn honking)

I wonder how far it is.

It's 245 feet.

So not very far, then.

Why is your watch
on the inside of your wrist?

Is it? I don't know.

(camera clicks)

So what's your subject, then?

<i>- Le Frangais.</i>
Oh. Oui.

<i>- Parlez-vous Frangais?</i>
Oui.


(speaks French)

(clears throat)

<i>Magnifique.</i>

<i>â™ª There was a time
I thought of mine only... â™ª</i>

Cheers.

Cheers.

<i>â™ª I was noble personage â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Born to beautify the page â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I used time to set it down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There was a time
I thought of mine... â™ª</i>

Tony: You still haven't
told me your name.

I tend to find it inadvisable
to give out my name

to strange men
I've only just met.

Margaret: Sounds like
a fruitcake, this Sarah.

Veronica.
Her name's Veronica.

What? I thought you said
the diary belonged to Sarah?

Apparently, yes, the diary, yes,

left to me by Sarah Ford.

Who is?
Veronica's mother.

So, you... you slept with Veronica
or you slept with Sarah?

Strictly speaking, neither.
Sadly.

Veronica and I were together.

Boyfriend and girlfriend.

Exactly, yes.
Kind-kind of an item, yes.

But that...
And that's how you know Sarah.

Yes.
Right.

So we're getting somewhere.

(horn honking)

Looks like he's planning to move in.

You look nervous.

Tony, this is my father.

Tony.
David.

We've heard all about you, Tony.
Come on.

Let's get you two lovebirds home.

(horn honks)

Ta-da!

Oh, um...

you can pee into the basin at night,
if you wish.


(woman singing indistinctly)

(man clears throat)

Not bad, eh?

Jack.

I'm the big brother.

Tony.

We've heard all about you, Tony.
Oh? (Laughs)

How do you like your lamb, Tony?

Sorry?

We're having lamb this evening.
(both chuckle)

Oh. I see.

Excellent.

I'm, uh, I'm partial to a bit
of rare meat myself.

I'll let you get settled.

(door closes)


Here, Tony,
have some roast potatoes.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mrs. Ford,
it all looks lovely.

Hear, hear.
Motion seconded.

Jack:
And me, please, Mother.

Thank you.

How many?
One more, please.

Sarah:
Pass it down.

Do start.

Uh, a friend of mine's
at Cambridge, as it happens.

Uh, Adrian Finn?

Should I know him?
Uh, he's studying philosophy.

My deepest sympathies.


(kicks under table)

Sarah: And what about you, Tony?
You haven't told us what your subject is.

English literature.

Sarah: And what do you hope to do
with an undergraduate degree

in English literature?

Well, um...

I-I hope to write.

Write?
Yes.

Um, poems. Poetry.

A Poet?

And who's your favorite poet?

Mum.

Dylan Thomas.
David: Ah, yes, yes.

The gloomy Welshman.

Jack:
â€œAnd the winds did bloom,

and the brides in the wooed field

did sew the coming
summer frost."

David:
Ah, bravo, Jack.

See what I have to
put up with, Tony?

I'm partial to
a little Larkin myself.

Oh, yes.

He's wonderful, also.

"I work all day,
and get half drunk at night.

Waking at four to soundless dark...

I stare.

In time,
the curtain-edges will go bright."

(chuckles awkwardly)

Jack: Hear, hear.

(chuckles bashfully)

So...

Good night, then.

say anything embarrassing

at dinner, did I?

Why are you whispering?

I don't know.

(normal voice)
Sorry.

the sleep of the wicked.


It's important you
understand the scale

of sexual frustration
of my younger self.

For God's sake.
You poor thing.

You sure there isn't
some un-doused fire

in your breast, Mr. Webster?

Quite sure.

So if... let's presume,
still unmarried fruitcake

walked into this restaurant now

and sat in that table...

how would the long-divorced
Mr. Anthony Webster react?

I don't think I'd be
especially pleased to see her.

So you wouldn't start rolling up
your sleeves and turning over your watch?

God.
I wish I'd never told you that.

Can we have another...
More coffee?

Come on,
let's hear the rest of it.

Sarah: Morning.
(metal clatters)

You looking for something?
(chuckles) No, I was just looking.

The others have gone for a walk.

Veronica said
you'd prefer a lie-in,

so we opted not to disturb you.

You hungry?

Uh, yes.

Have a seat.

(Sarah humming)

You won't let Veronica get away
with too much, will you?

Sorry?

Don't let her get away
with too much.

Sorry, I'm not quite sure
I follow your meaning.

Oh! Damn it!


Whoops.

Sorry.

I'm normally very good at eggs.

Tony, let me give you a hand.
Thank you.

(David humming)

Well, Jack.

He'll do, I suppose.

(all laughing)

Thanks for staying
the weekend, Tony.

Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

(engine starts)

(David humming)

I like your mum.

(David laughs)
Sounds like you've got a rival, Vron.

Come to think of it,
sounds like you're not the only one.

Excuse me, I'm still speaking.

You don't say.

Something is clearly going on.

Someone you knew long ago

has left you something or other.

Exactly. Which has been
unduly withheld from me

and to which
I am legally entitled.

Well, you could fight it,
or you can just let it go.

Cash the check,
take me on a budget holiday.

250 each,
get us to the Channel Islands.

Listen, the point I...
Something is certainly going on.

So just call me when you
really want to talk about it.

Oh, and the foot's much better,
thanks for asking.

How is it, the foot?

(door opens, closes)

(music playing)

(alarm clock ringing)

(car horn honks)

Woman:
So, I passed on your letters,

all 13 of them, to Miss Ford.

And?
While Miss Ford is still not ready

to part with the diary.

I can tell you that the diary,
it seems,

belonged to a Mr. Adrian Finn.

I see.

Now, I've raised your concern
in terms of if or when

you might be able to receive
Mr. Finn's diary.

Let me get this straight.

She should have handed
the diary over to you.

She hasn't.

You've asked for it,

but she's refusing to give it up.

Yes, that's-that's certainly
how things stand at present.

In my experience,
Mr. Webster,

people often like to take some time out
following a bereavement.

Don't you think?

That's as may be.

But I want to be quite sure

that you are clear that
that diary belongs to me.

(brakes squeal)
(horn honks)

(car lock beeps)

Hello.

Andrew, this is Tony,
my ex-husband.

Ah.

How are you doing, Tony?
All right?

Hi.
We work together.

Can we talk?
It's important.

Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

Good to meet you, Tony.

I'll see you Monday.

This is not on, Tony, coming around
without being asked, sorry.

You told me to call when I was ready
to tell you what was going on.

You gonna let me in?

Headmaster:
From summer to autumn.

So, too, do we think ahead...

Rather him than us.

To what we may achieve together.

(boys laughing)

(door opens)

Good morning, gentlemen.

I trust that you had good holidays,

but time and tide tarry
for no man, so...

Henry VIII.

Which of you bright young
things can give me

a characterization
of the age, hmm?

Hmm?

Simpson.

Any thoughts?

There was unrest, sir.
(students laugh)

No, no, insightful, as always.

But might you perhaps
care to elaborate?

There was great unrest, sir.
(students laugh)

Oh, dear.

Anyone?

Finn?

Now, I'm conscious
it's your first day with us,

but, um, any thoughts?

I don't know.
What don't you know?

Adrian: Well, I cannot know
what I don't know, sir,

that's philosophically self-evident.

What we do know is that
something happened, sir.

Professor:
Come again?

Well, something happened.

All one can ever truly say of
any particular period of history, sir,

is that something happened.

Tony:
Hey, um, great line to Hunt, earlier.

About something happened?

Adrian: Oh, yes.

I was disappointed
he didn't take that up.

Well, I thought you made
an extremely valid point.

I'm, uh, Tony Webster.

I'm Adrian Finn.

It's cheery.

Are you familiar
with Dylan Thomas?

Hmm, yes.

I find him to be one of the most
humane poets of the 20th century.

Boy: But then he did say it,
it was ridiculous.

Parents, what a load of effing bastards.

Adrian Finn, Colin Simpson.
Colin Simpson, Adrian Finn.

Hello, Adrian Finn.
And, uh, this is Alex Stuart.

Oh, really great line to Hunt,
really great.

Is there an issue
with your parents?

Ugh, "issue" is putting it mildly.

Just when you think
you can trust them...

Effing bastards.
Just when you think you can trust them,

they go and behave like...
Henry VIII?

Like Henry the fucking VIII, exactly.

Why are all your watches
turned inside?

Ah, because...
That is a very good question.

We're taking a stand against...
Hierarchically imposed...

intrinsically flawed...
notions of time.

It also looks quite cool.

Colin:
So, Dylan Thomas, interesting.

Yes.

Any good?
Do you know him?

Not really.
Alex". Not personally.

(all laughing)

Really sick of staring at wood paneling.

(both chuckle)


I'm sorry to report...

that I have some rather sad news

which I wish to share
with you all this morning.

Joseph Dobson,
of the Science Sixth...

has been found dead.

He was a gifted pupil
with a natural aptitude

for both science
and modern languages.

He was sadly cut down
in the flower of his youth...

"Flower"?
Dobson is more vegetable material.

(stifled laugh)
Alex: Was.

Must have killed himself.

Headmaster:
His brother, sister...

What?
Colin: Shit.

Finn, you're unusually quiet
this afternoon.

I'm not sure I can add
anything to the debate, sir.

Will wonders never cease?

I don't find
the historian's need

to ascribe responsibility

a particularly fruitful arena, sir.

Care to elaborate?

Historians yearn for an answer
to the question

of who's to blame for this event

or for that atrocity, but...
I don't know, sir.

Sometimes it seems to me
it is impossible to know.

Go on.

Well, Patrick Lagrange,
sir, said that,

"History is the certainty
produced at the point

when the imperfections of memory

meet the inadequacies
of documentation."

It's the lies of victors, sir.

As long as you understand
that it is also

the delusions of the defeated.

Adrian:
Take Dobson's suicide, sir.

Professor Hunt:
Okay.

We are told Dobson
came to take his own life,

perhaps when he understood
his girlfriend was pregnant.

Finn...

Dobson's death
is a private matter.

No... it's also a historical matter.

The point I'm trying to make, sir,
is that nothing can now be known

in the absence
of Dobson's own testimony.

We...

we may never know the truth.

And...

no amount of intellectual posturing
can alter that.

Do you see the problem, sir?

Finn, I see the problem,
thank you.

Camus says that suicide is
the only true philosophical question.

Apart from ethics,
politics, aesthetics,

and all that other stuff.

All that other stuff
we're learning about in school.

About the beauty and wisdom...
The only true one.

The essential one on which
all the others depend.

When we left school
and went our separate ways,

out of everyone,
Adrian was the only one

I desperately wanted
to stay in touch with.

Lovely. Thank you.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Both:
Mm!

That is good.

I dare say it's almost
as good as sex.

Couldn't possibly comment.

Maybe I need to improve
my taste in wine.

Or your taste in sex.

Speaking of which,
are we going to address the fact

that almost everything
you've told me in the last few days,

you've told me
for the very first time?

I've never told you about all this stuff
because it wasn't important.

In all the years that
we were together, Mr. Webster,

it has never occurred to you
that it might be important to tell me

about your former love?

Your first love, no doubt.

I'm not talking
about Adrian Finn.

I see.

Well, Mrs. Webster,

I think you're very much
barking up the wrong tree.

Indeed, on the wrong
patch of land altogether.

Veronica and I were never in love,
I can assure you.

She gave you your first camera,
didn't she?

(music playing)

Mm, Tony, it doesn't feel right.

(Tony exhales)

(knuckles cracking)

Do you ever think about where
our relationship is heading?

Is this a thinly-veiled attempt
to bring up our sex life?

No.

I'm positively laid-back

about the fact that
we haven't had sex yet.

Does it have to?

Does it have to what?

Head somewhere?
Our relationship.

At the time I thought,
at least nobody died.

Nobody got pregnant.

You sound positively crestfallen.

Mm.

Oh, please, no.
I'll be all over the place.

Stop.
(chuckles)

But how did your friend's diary

end up with fruitcake's mother?

I think Adrian's stuff
ended up with Veronica.

And that's how the diary
found its way to Sarah Ford.

Yeah, but how did Adrian's stuff
end up with fruitcake?

Veronica.
I was just coming to that.

(indistinct chatter on TV)

(knocks on door)

Adrian: Dear, Tony, I wanted to
write to you as in recent months,

Veronica and I have
grown very close.

Indeed, we have now embarked
upon a relationship together.

This would no doubt
come to your attention,

and we thought it best
you heard it from us.

Your friendship is deeply
important to us, Tony.



(music playing)

When did you last see him, then?

About three months ago.

Right where you're sitting.
That's why I suggested it.

He was going down
to Chislehurst.

How did he seem?
Cheerful.

Happy, like himself.

Only more so.

As we said good-bye,
he told me he was in love.

(breathes deeply)

How did he do it?
Wrists in the bath.

Jesus Christ.

Alex:
He knew how to do it.

Diagonally.

If you, uh, cut straight across,

you lose consciousness
and the wound heals up.

You botched it.

Well, perhaps
you drown yourself.

No, still second place.

Adrian would have wanted first.

Sort of Greek, isn't it?

Both:
No, it's, um, hemlock.


More the exemplary Roman, I'd say.

Opening the vein.

It's effing impressive.
Yeah.

Or a miserable waste.

Margaret: So what do you think
you'll find in the diary?

I've no idea. It's just mine.


I think it's quite touching
that you're so stubborn.

Probably a way of
not losing the plot at your age.

I don't think I'd reacted
any differently

when we were younger.

Do you remember
that AU pair we had?

The...

Swedish one?
Mm.

I found her diary once.

And I...

I was tidying up, and I read it.

Do you know what I found?

She'd written,
"I'm working for a real cow."


"Husband's all right,
just keeps looking at my arse."

Uh, you should have said,
we'd have got rid of her.


That's not the point of my story.


It's getting late.
Is it?

Surely you're not insisting
your inebriated ex

risks his life on the open road?

Collateral damage.

Think about my fellow drivers, then.

You're not staying.
(sighs)


Good night, then.

Wait, wait, wait.
I've got a question.

Got a question.

Why did you leave me?
(sighs)

Be honest.

Tony...

No, be honest.
No, tell me.

Did you leave because of me?

Are you angry about Veronica?

I'm not anything about Veronica.

Wasn't that bad, was it?
(both laughing)

Good night, Tony.
Good night.

(beeps, clicks)

(computer chimes)

(music playing)

Tony Webster.
Colin Simpson.

How the devil are you?
Wonderful to see you.

Alex...
Good to see you.

Great to see you.

You go and get in, sit in there.

Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Go on, go, go, go, go-

(Tony chuckling)

Colin:
Do you want a tea?

Boys, you haven't changed.
I will have a tea.

Colin: Excuse me, love,
could we have another tea?

Blimey.

What a nut job.

What ever did you see in her?

You and Adrian both.

Well, you know,
she was very mysterious.


You know, the great irony,
of course,

was that it was you
that introduced them.

Introduced who?

Adrian and Veronica.

No, Adrian met Veronica
through her brother Jack.

Oh, wishful thinking,
my old friend.

No.

Yeah, Adrian and Jack
were at Cambridge together.

But that's not how they met.

No, it was your fault
that they got together.

Hole-in-one.
No, no, no.

You came up to town from Bristol

with your ladylove
and you met all of us.

Yeah, chomping at the bit
to introduce the love of your life.

Oh, I could've sworn
they met through Jack.

Afraid not.

I'm surprised you haven't had a good
rummage through the Webster albums.

If memory serves,
you were always snapping away.

Hmm. They must have been
deemed surplus to requirements.

Colin:
Mm, that's a pity, old bean.

Alex:
So have you... have you tried

contacting her directly?
How?

She's not there. Try Jack.
Okay.

(keyboard clacking)

Mm-hmm.

Oh...

Oh, right.

Loads of them.


What about...

What that...
This one?

Oh, it's him.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Wow.

God.
Where on earth is he?

Cricket.

Tennis, no?
Tennis.

Oh, look.
(laughs)

All: Mm.

Who's that?
I don't know.

This is very nice.

He looks as self-satisfied
as he ever did.


All: Oh...

Oh!
(laughing)

Do you want to
send him a message?

Isn't that a bit much?
No, it'd be rude not to.

Do people really
communicate this way?

Yours truly
communicates this way.

Really?
Yeah.

L-I got in touch with a woman
I'd been at university with.

Hadn't seen her for
the best part of 40 years.

We met up,
got on like a house on fire.

Oh, great.
You see, it's a boon for us widowers.

Mm.
Hmm.

There you go.

Sent.
(computer chimes)

Oh, done.

What?
You're in now.

Welcome to the 21 st century,
Mr. Webster.

Oh, blimey.

Ta-Ra.
(rain pattering)

Tell us how it all turns out.
Certainly will.

Don't let it get to you, old bean.

Insightful as always.

Alex:
Henry VIII.

"Now, which one of you
young bright things can offer

a characterization of the age?

Simpson?"

Colin:
I'd say there was unrest, sir.

there was great unrest, sir.

Bollocks!

I'm unable to take your call now.

Please leave me a message

Thank you.
(grunts)

(answering machine beeps)

Woman: Hello.

This is Veronica Ford.

I am in receipt of
all your correspondence,

and I also understand
from my brother

that you wish to meet
to discuss my mother's estate.

I will be in town this morning.

I will see you at
the wobbly bridge at 9:00 a.m.

(line clicks)


Shit.

Are you...

are you sure?

Really, Anthony.

You said it didn't feel right
when we were going out.

No, it didn't... then.

But it does now?

I don't know.

You're quite cowardly,
aren't you?

<i>â™ª Time has told me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You came with the dawn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A soul with no footprint... â™ª</i>

Veronica?

Hello, Anthony.
You look well.

You're bald.

Well, at least it proves
I'm not an alcoholic.

Do people think
you're an alcoholic?

No. No, they don't.

I read somewhere that
if you're a very heavy drinker,

there's something in the booze
that stops your hair from falling out.

Shall we find
somewhere to sit down?

Where?

Anywhere?
I'm easy, as you may recall.

Ready to order?

Um...
I'll have a fresh mint tea, please.

Um, what sort of coffee
do you serve?

We serve our own blend.

Roasted in our Roastery
in Heme Hill.

Oh, blimey. Uh...

We don't mess around.
(chuckles)

Uh, in that case,
I'll have a <i>Macchiato</i>, please.

Single or double?
Single, thank you.

Thank you.

Their own blend.

Impressive stuff.

(boy exclaiming)
Woman: Oh!

(wood clacking)

I was sorry to hear about
your mother, Veronica.

Yes.

As, uh, as you're no doubt aware,

it appears that your mother
left something to me in her will.

And when I spoke

with your mother's solicitor...

I was told that the item
that has been left to me was...

um, a diary written by Adrian.

I don't have the diary.
Excuse me?

I burnt it.

But it belongs to me.

It doesn't belong to anyone.
Boy: Vroom, vroom, vroom!

Look!

I think you'll find that the zoo
is north of the river.

Unbelievable.

Uh... I at least have,

uh, the right to know
what is in it.

Yes'.

Morally, no.

Have you any idea
how unsettling it was for me after,

however many years it's been,

to receive a letter from your mother?

I can't be held accountable
for my mother's actions.

Actually, as executor of her will,

I rather suggest that you can.

What's this?

Because you seem to need
something to read.

Bye, Anthony.
I'm-I'm sorry I raised my voice.

(indistinct chattering)

(car lock beeps)

(car door closes)

(car engine starts)

(cell phone chiming)

Hi.

(horn honking)

(tires screech)

Sorry.
That wasn't five minutes.

No, I know, it's...

Oh, quick. Right.

Traffic was dreadful.
I'm really sorry.

So this is it, is it?

No, it's a spectacularly
elaborate wind-up, Dad.

Yeah, sorry.
Sorry, point taken.

Have you heard from Mum?

Uh, no, no, but I phoned her

and she's in a meeting,
but I left a message.

(grunts)
Oh.

Oh!

Right. Okay.

Off we go.

(engine starts)

Dad, I think I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick?

(Susie groans)


Oh, this whole thing's
such a load of shit.

I mean, our gene pool alone
is bad enough.

Workaholic meets curmudgeon

meets deranged 30-something.
You're not a curmudgeon.

I was talking about you.
I know, darling.

The best thing you can do
is just relax,

calm down.
Look, don't tell me to relax.

Jesus. Just call Mum.

Afternoon, I'm Emma.

Hi, Emma. I'm Tony.
This is Susie.

How we doing?
We're having a bit of a wobble.

Oh, for Christ's sake, Dad.

All right, I'll leave
you two to it, okay?

Where are you going?
Isn't that what you want?

Do you want me to stay?
Do you want me to go? Call Mum?

Yes.

Right, right.

(door closes)

(men laughing on TV)

Man on TV:
Good night, Harry.

(laughing on TV)

Man on TV: Flying Doctor
calling Wollumboola base.

Tony:
â€œDear, Adrian and Veronica.

Hello, bitch,
and welcome to this letter.

(door opens)

A letter to you both
to wish you much joy.

You certainly deserve one another.
(typewriter dinging)


Indeed, I hope you get so involved

that the mutual damage
will be permanent.

Part of me hopes
you'll have a child

because I'm a great believer
in time's revenge.

Yay unto the next generation,
and all that.

But in fairness,

it would perhaps be
somewhat unjust

to inflict such ill will

on the fruit
of your poisonous Joins.

Adrian, if she hasn't
let you go all the way yet,

I suggest you break up with her.

And no doubt she'll be round
your place as quick as a flash

with sodden knickers
and a three-pack,

eager to give it away.

(Veronica moaning)

Certainly,
it worked for yours truly.

Veronica is undoubtedly
someone who will manipulate you.

Even her own mother
warned me against her.

In fact, if I were you,
I'd check things out with Mum.â€œ

Margaret: Tony?

Where is she?
It's all right.

She's all right. She's fine.

She's through here.


So what was the problem?

It's fine.
It's a false alarm.

I don't understand.

No one's expecting you to.
Give me some credit.

(Susie coughs)
Stop the car.

Stop the car.
All right.

She's feeling sick.
Okay.

Stop the car.

(tires screech)

(Susie vomiting)

Margaret:
Good girl. Good girl.

Get it all out.
(Susie coughing)

(Susie groaning)

How is she?
She's fine.

Do you need a lift home?

I think I'm gonna stay.

Do you think I should stay, too?
That's completely up to you.

I met Veronica.

Well, congratulations.

Would you believe it,
she's hardly changed.

Still has the same
extraordinary coldness.

Here.
What?

To mop up the drool.

Ah.

I want to show you something.
What?

What's that?
Open it.

This is horrible.


Did you write this?

She gave it to me,
and then she left.

But I followed her.
You did what?

I don't mean followed followed,

but she set off before...
This her car license number?

Yes, but, wait, listen.

All I wanted to do
was establish...

Following someone home and casually
jotting down their car license number

is tantamount to stalking.

Oh, Margaret, come on.
No, I'm perfectly serious.

Seems to me
you're a hair's breadth away

from a restraining order.

I wanted to apologize.
No, you didn't.

You wanted to hear her say how wonderful
you are and how you haven't changed.

And how she's thought of you
all these years,

and looked up at the stars
and wondered...

I'm sorry,
it's all a bit pathetic.

Don't hold back, will you?

Do you know what
really strikes me is...

your total inability to see
what's right under your nose.

Such as?

Such as your daughter,

who happens to be lying next door
going out of her mind.

You said she was fine.

You're on your own now.

Man: Might rain later.

Veronica:
Mm, there's always a later.

(car engine starts)

(indistinct conversation)


(men shouting)

Hey, hey, that's enough.

I said that's enough.
Friday's pub night.

Man: Take me to the pub!
Hey, Graham, I'm watching you.

All right.

Come on,
let's all make it across.

We'll make the pub in one piece.

Here we are, guys.
Do a little headcount.

(continues indistinctly)

Veronica: Are you all looking
forward to your beers?

Okay.
Well, I'm gonna be leaving you.

Man: Are you going?
And I'll see you next week.

All right?
Man: Bye.

See you next week.
See ya.

Bye-bye, Veronica.

Lovely to see you.

All: Bye-bye.

(continues indistinctly)

(siren wailing in distance)

What are you doing?
Oh, hi.

I saw you and, uh...

Saw me and what?
I was... I was passing through,

and I saw you, and I thought,
well, now's the chance to...

I don't want you following me.
I wasn't following you.

You were running after me.

Jogging, maybe.

What'd you want?
When I read that letter...

It wasn't intended
as a start to a conversation.

Nonetheless,
let me at least buy you a drink.

Let me buy you a drink, and you'll
never have to see me again, ever.

What is this?

Those are my details, uh, email...
No, I have your details.

What is it that you do?
I have a shop,

albeit a very, very,
very small shop, selling cameras.

Rare, second-hand cameras.
Leicas.

Make a living?

Yes, well, depends
what you call a living.

I'm retired, so...

So, coffee or drink?

Is this about "closing the circle"?

Don't know about that.
But it can't hurt, can it?

I'm not available at the moment to go
and have a drink with you.

Okay.

But perhaps at some point.

Great.

Fantastic.
Eh, whenever suits.

(keys jingling)


(indistinct chattering)

Woman:
Okay, who loves â€œThe Simpsonsâ€œ?

Me, me.

"Downton's Abbey"?
(woman speaking indistinctly)

I've never...
I don't watch "Downton's Abbey."

(chatter continues indistinct)

I'm going to go to the toilet.
Okay.

She works on... she works...
I don't know.

(men chattering)

No, she's not.

What was her name again?
I don't know.

Yes, you do.
No, I don't.

You do know her name.

Like your badges.

Yeah.

Amazing array.
Can I have a look?

Ah, they're brilliant.

I'm a Stones fan myself.

Do you wanna tell him
where you get them from?

Yeah, where do you get them?

Do you have a favorite
in particular?

This one?
Yeah?

It is...
I think.

Yeah, it was very expensive, wasn't it?
Brilliant.

You bought that one
the other day, didn't you, Adrian?

Nice meeting you, Adrian.

They're brilliant.
Really brilliant.

Have a good day.
And you.

Come on.

Take Dobson's suicide, sir.

We are told Dobson
came to take his own life,

perhaps when he understood
his girlfriend was pregnant.

Tony:
"Indeed, I hope you get so involved

that the mutual damage
will be permanent.

Part of me hopes
you'll have a child

because I'm a great believer
in time's revenge."

(typewriter dings)

(music playing)

What are you reading?

Zweig.

So you've worked your way
right through the alphabet, have you?

Can't be anyone left after him.


Are you, uh, married, I take it?

Not married.
Never?

Mysterious to a fault.

I'm divorced, by the way.
In case you were wondering.

I wasn't, but...

I'm sorry to hear that.
On the contrary.

Very happily so.

Best decision we ever undertook.

In fact, she...

Margaret recently accused me

of having built
a shrine to you no less.

The shop.

When I told her that it was you
who gave me my first Leica.

And what did you say?

Ah!

Woman: Hi, Tony.

Those two are...

in my daughter's NCT group.

Lesbians, pregnant lesbians.

Good God.

Whatever will they all
think of next?


My daughter's 36, by the way.

Apart from coming off
the rails somewhat

and deciding to have a child
all on her very own,

she works in PR.

Whatever that may mean.

Thanks for the tea, Tony.

I... I have to leave,
I have an appointment.

Are you... Did I say...
No, finish your cake.

Is this because I've been
banging on about myself?

'Cause I don't mean to.
No.

Uh, the other day...

after we met,
I went to that pub.

I met Adrian.

Both Adrian and you
are very important to me.

And all I can say is that
abhorrent letter of mine

was the expression of a moment.

And it was deeply shocking
for me to read after all these years.

Do we really need to do this?
If I may, though.

I'm not expecting you to hand over
Adrian's diary anymore.

If you've burnt it,
that's the end of it.

And if not, as it was written
by the father of your son,

it belongs to you.

Enough.
I-l can only imagine

how difficult it's been for you.

No, you cannot imagine.

No. Right. Yes.

Whoops.

(both laughing)


(indistinct chattering)

(music playing)

Man:
Is that everyone?

(door closes)

Adrian, are you okay?

Adrian, Jr.:
It's that man.

(indistinct conversation)

Yeah, that one I saw, yeah.

Over there?
Yes.

The one with the bad beard?


I'll be right back.

Hello.

Is there something
I can help you with?

Do you want a chip?
No, no, I'm fine.

On the menu it says
they're fat cut, hand cut.

But what it really means
is they're fat cut.

They've not actually
been cut by hand at all.

Uh, look, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

I'll do my best.

I think, for whatever reason,

one of the people I look after
is a little uncomfortable

with you being here.

Again.
Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to upset anyone.
I'll leave.

If you don't mind,
can I ask who you are?

Tony Webster.
Uh, Ben.

Do you mind if I sit down, Tony?
Of course.

Cheers.

I was an old friend
of Adrian's father,

and I've recently become
reacquainted with his mother.

Oh, you'll understand, then.

She and I were
at university together.

Really? You don't look
old enough to have been at uni

with Adrian's mum.
You're too kind.

I was rather hoping to
bump into her here, but, uh...

Wait, wait, sorry.
Uh, bump into who?

Veronica.
Adrian's mother.

Um...

you understand I can't discuss
our clients' histories,

it's a matter of confidentiality.

Yeah, of course.
Um...

Now, if you are a friend of the family,
what you're saying, Tony,

doesn't make any sense.

Veronica is Adrian's sister.

Um, their mother, Sarah,
passed away six months ago.

How did he seem?
Cheerful.

Happy. Like himself.

Only more so.

As we said good-bye,
he told me he was in love.

You won't let Veronica get away
with too much, will you?

Sorry?

Don't let her get away
with too much.

Are we okay?

They seem very happy,
the five of them.

You obviously do a good job.
We try our best.

Good luck to you all.

I'm gonna head back
to the group.

(cell phone chiming)

Margaret: Please leave me
a message after the beep.

(beeps)
Margaret, it's me again.

Yeah, uh, this is it.

I think this is definitely it.
Where are you?

(cell phone beeps)


Tell me about your day.

My day?

Yeah. What you did.

Oh. Okay.
I went to High-gate.

To see a woman who I'd had
a relationship with

when I was an undergraduate.

We've recently become reacquainted,

but she wasn't there.

Wasn't where?
At home.

So what were you doing there?

I went to see her.

But she wasn't there.
No.

I waited around a bit, outside...

at the station.

So you're stalking her?
You're her stalker.

No.
Yes, you are.

No. Not at all, no.

No, moving on.

We broke up is the point.

While we were
still at university.

And not long after, she formed
a relationship with my best friend.

And I wrote them both

a very nasty letter.

And recently, I've been working
under the assumption

that they'd had a child together

shortly before my best friend
committed suicide.

But now it appears
that the mother of that child

wasn't my ex-girlfriend,
but it was her mother.

And I can only assume
that it was my...

horrible letter that
in some way pushed the...

(knocks on door)
friend...

(door opens)

(Susie clears throat)

Emma:
Hello again, Tony.

Emma.
Oh, hi, Emma.

How we doing?
(sighs)

I'd say holding up, just about.

Emma: (softly)
I'll just check baby's head.

No, no, no.
Dad, stay.

Just for a bit.

You can hold my hand.

(heart monitor beeping)

What's going on?

I don't know what's going on.
Tony: Everything's fine.

Dad, why isn't anyone
saying anything?

Everything's absolutely fine.

We're nearly there,
I promise you.

(breathing heavily)

Emma:
Susie, you have a baby.

Congratulations.

Why isn't he crying?

He's not crying.

Can you see anything?
He's fine. He's fine.

Why isn't he crying?

Excuse me, my daughter's asking,

why isn't her son crying?

(baby crying)


So proud of you.
(Susie chuckles)

I wanna see him.
Tony: Yeah.

Baby.
Ah, look.

Say hello to your mummy.

(Susie laughing)
There he is.

It's very hot.
Margaret: Thank you.

You don't have to stay here,
you know.

I want to.

Susie said you dealt
with everything very impressively.

I'm not an entirely redundant
member of this family, yet.

I've never said you were.
Haven't you?

Where are you going?

I'm gonna give you some space.

Fine. But, uh...

you may be interested to know,
you probably won't,

but I was planning on
making an apology to you.

For being insensitive,
being a bore,

for being a monumental
pain in the arse.

Maybe it's too little too late,
but I hope not.

I know, technically,

we're not supposed
to make pronouncements

of this nature anymore, but...

you and Susie are the two
most important people in my life.

Divorced, married,
makes no difference.

Well, there you are.

Despite what you might think...

I assure you, I'm trying.

(tapping on watch)

What's wrong with your watch?

It's stopped.


Come on, baby.
(both chuckling)

Get you home.

Leaving.
(baby crying)

Leaving hospital.

Tony: How often do we
tell our own life story?

How often do we adjust,
embellish, make sly cuts?

And the longer life goes on,

the fewer are those around
to tell us our life is not our life.

It is just a story
we've told about our lives.

A story about our lives
told to others,

but mainly to ourselves.

Oh, hello.
How are you?

Uh, what?
Are you well?

I'm fine.
Want a coffee?

Y-Yeah.

(sighs)
Mm.

Thank you.

Could you, um...

could you sign here, please?
I just got...

(device beeping)

Thank you.

Great, thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.


Tony: "I've been turning over
in my mind the question of nostalgia,

and whether! Suffer from it.

I suppose I am nostalgic.

I think of my time with Margaret

and Susie's birth and her first years.

A bunch of kids in school.

(all laughing)

A girl dancing
for once in her life.


A secret horizontal gesture
beneath a sunlit Wisteria.

I think of Adrian's
definition of history.

I think of everything
that has happened in my life...

and how little
I have allowed to happen.

I, who neither won nor lost.

Who avoided being hurt

and called it
a capacity for survival.

I think of how our lives
got entwined

and went along together
for a time.

And when I look back,

now, on that time,
however brief...

I am moved
more than I thought possible.

Indeed, I'm sorry
that I have known nothing

of your life in the years since.

No doubt you could have taught

How are you?

We had a lovely lunch comparing
the damage done to our bodies.

Vaginas and all.
Oh, Joshua, cover your ears.

Cover your ears.

Susie:
Very good.

Tony:
You're a special young man.
