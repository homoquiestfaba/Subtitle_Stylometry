The Perks of Being a Wallflower

Subtitle By: hossein6

<i>Dear Friend...</i>

<i>I am writing to you because
she said you listen and understand...</i>

<i>...and didn't try to sleep with
that person at that party...</i>

<i>...even though you could have.</i>

<i>Please don't try to
figure out who I am...</i>

<i>...I don't want you to do that.</i>

<i>I just need to know that
people like you exist.</i>

<i>Like if you met me,
you wouldn't think I was...</i>

<i>...the weird kid who spent
time in the hospital.</i>

<i>And I wouldn't make you nervous.</i>

<i>I hope it's okay for me to think that.</i>

<i>You see, I haven't really talked to
anyone outside of my family all summer.</i>

<i>But tomorrow is my first
day of high school ever...</i>

<i>...and I need to turn things around.</i>

<i>So, I have a plan.</i>

<i>As I enter the school for the first time...</i>

<i>...I will visualize what it will be like on
the last day of my senior year.</i>

<i>Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...</i>

Hop, freshman toads.
Hop! Let's move it, boys!

<i>...1385 days from now.</i>

Worked out all summer.
Rock hard.

You know,
Why don't you guys get a room?

<i>Just 1385 days.</i>

<i>In the meantime, I'd hoped that my
sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek...</i>

<i>...would have let me eat
lunch with their Earth Club.</i>

Seniors only.

What are you doing
with that plastic spork?

I don't want to bring back silverware.

Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Come on.

<i>When my sister said no...</i>

<i>...I thought maybe my old friend Susan
would want to have lunch with me.</i>

<i>In middle school, Susan
was very fun to be around, but...</i>

<i>...now she doesn't like
to say hi to me anymore.</i>

<i>And then there's Brad Hays.</i>

<i>Before my brother went to
play football for Penn State...</i>

<i>...he and Brad played together.</i>

<i>So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me.</i>

<i>But Brad's a senior and I'm me,
so, who am I kidding?</i>

<i>On the bright side,
one senior decided to...</i>

<i>...make fun of the teacher
instead of the freshmen.</i>

<i>He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee with a grease pencil.</i>

The prick punch is not a toy.

I learned that back in 'Nam in '68.

"Callahan," the sergeant said...

..."you put down that prick
punch, you go kill some gooks."

And you know what happened?

That prick punch killed my best friend
in a Saigon whorehouse.

I heard you were gonna be in my class.

Are you proud to be a senior having to
take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?

Look. My name is Patrick.

Either you call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.

Okay, Nothing.

<i>I felt really bad for Patrick.</i>

<i>He wasn't saying the impersonation
to be mean or anything.</i>

<i>He was just trying to make us
freshmen feel better.</i>

Nothing, why don't you read first?

Alright. Chapter 1.

Surviving your fascist shop teacher,
who needs to put kids down to feel big.

Oh, wow. This is useful guys.
We should read on.

<i>My last class of the
day is advanced English...</i>

<i>...and I'm really excited to finally learn
with the smartest kids in the school.</i>

Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

<i>Believe it or not she's gotten
straight A since kindergarten.</i>

I'm Mr. Anderson.

I'm going to be your
teacher for freshman English.

This semester, we're going to be learning
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.

Genius book.

Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?

I'm shocked.

Alright.
Well, you can skip the quiz...

...if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.

Anyone?

He was British.

He also invented the serial.

In fact, at the end of
the third chapter of his first novel...

...he had a man hanging
from a cliff by his fingernails.

Hence, the term cliffhanger.

Anybody?

Yeah.
Shakespeare.

That's a great guess, but no,
Shakespeare didn't write novels.

Anybody else?

The author...

...is Charles Dickens.

However, if you and I
had gone to a Shakespeare play...

...it would have cost us 4 pennies.

Can you imagine that?

We would have put those
pennies in a metal box...

...the ushers would lock in the office.

And that's where we get the term...

Cash register.

I'll give you a free "A" on anything till
the final term paper if you get it right.

Box office.

You should learn to participate.

Why didn't you raise your hand?

They call you teacher's pet?

Freak? That kind of things?

I used to get spaz.
I mean, come on, spaz?

You know, I heard
you had a tough time last year.

But they say if you make...

...one friend on your first day,
you're doing okay.

Thank you, sir.

But if my English teacher is
the only friend I make today...

...that would be sort of depressing.

Yeah. I could see that.

Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
I'm okay.

Thanks.

I would happily not take shop...

Hey, Freshman Toad.

<i>Well, I have 1384 days to go.</i>

<i>Just so I say it to someone...</i>

<i>...high school is even
worse than middle school.</i>

<i>If my parents ask me about it,
I probably won't tell them the truth...</i>

<i>...because I don't want them to
worry that I might get bad again.</i>

<i>If my Aunt Helen were still here,
I could talk to her.</i>

<i>And I know she would understand
how I am both happy and sad...</i>

<i>...and I'm still trying to
figure out how that could be.</i>

<i>I just hope I make a friend soon.</i>

<i>Love always, Charlie.</i>

Charlie, come on.

This chicken paprikash is delicious.

Thank you, Derek.
It's Charlie's favorite.

He was a little nervous about
starting high school today...

...so I made it for him.

You feel a little silly about
being nervous now, huh, champ?

Yes, sir. I do

I told you.

Just give 'em a smile and be yourself.

That's how you...
"...make friends in the real world."

You're cruisin' for a bruisin'

Freshman year is tough, but...

...you really find yourself.

Thanks, Derek.

You know, you could be
a little nicer to Derek.

I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy.
I can't stand him.

I really hope you love the mix tape I made.
I do.

The cover is hand-painted.
Oh. Wow.

Hey, Charlie, you want this?

Are you sure?

He gives me one every week.

<i>Hey, Babe.
This next one might be a little sad...</i>

<i>...but it reminded me of your eyes.</i>

Did you already do the term paper
on To Kill a Mockingbird?

Let's go, Devils!

Come on.

Hey, Nothing.
Hey, Nothing.

Oh, suck it, virginity pledges!

Suck it!

Hey, Patrick.

Hey! You're in my shop class, right?

How's your clock coming?

My dad's building it for me.

Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.

You wanna sit over here,
or are you waiting for your friends?

Oh, no, no, I'll sit.

Thanks for not calling
me "Nothing" by the way.

It's an endless nightmare.

And these assholes,
they actually think they're being original.

So, uh... do you like football?
Love it. Love football.

Maybe you know my brother, then.

Hey, Sam.

Question. Could the bathrooms here
be more disgusting?

Yes, they call it the men's room.

So, I finally got hold of Bob.

Party tonight?

He's still trying to shag that
waitress from the Olive Garden.

Oh, he's never tossing that salad.

Come on!

Patrick!

Yeah.
Who's this?

This is...

Charlie... Kelmeckis.
Kelmeckis! No shit!

Your sister's dating Pony Tail Derek, isn't she?
God!

Is that what they call him?

Would you leave Pony Tail Derek alone?

You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.

I try, Sam. I try.

It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.

So, Sam, what's the plan?
Are we going to Mary Elizabeth's tonight?

Nope. She got caught watering down
her parent's brandy with iced tea.

Let's just go to Kings.

Alright. We're going to Kings
after the game if you wanna come.

Do you have a favorite band?

Well, I think The Smiths are my favorite.

Are you kidding?
I love The Smiths!

The best breakup band ever.
What's your favorite song?

Asleep.
It's from Louder Than Bombs.

I heard it on Pony
Tail Derek's mix tape.

Oh, that works on so many levels.

I can make you guys a copy if you want.

What about Eide's?
You love Eide's, right?

Yeah, of course.
They're great.

Not a band, Charlie.

It's a record store downtown.

I think it sounds
so much better on the Vinyl.

You know, I used to be popular
before Sam got me some good music.

So, you should be careful.
She'll ruin your life forever.

That's okay.

Hey, Nothing.
Hey, Nothing.

Let it go! Jesus!
It's an antique joke!

It's over!

So, what are you gonna do
when you get out of this place?

Well, My Aunt Helen said
I should be a writer, but..

I don't know what I'd write about.

You could write about us.
Yeah.

Call it Slut and The Falcon.

Make us solve crimes.

You guys seem really happy together.

How long have you been
boyfriend and girlfriend?

He's not my boyfriend.
He's my step-brother.

My mom finally left my worthless dad and
married his nice dad when we moved here.

But She's not bitter or anything.
Make no mistake.

Absolutely not.

Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.
I'm a bulim-ist.

I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what that is.

She just really believes in bulimia.

I love bulimia.

Hey, thanks for paying, Charlie.

Oh, no problem.
Thank you guys for the ride.

Maybe I'll see you around in school?

God, would you turn that down?
You're gonna make us deaf.

So be it!
It's Rock and roll.

Bye, Charlie.
Bye, Charlie.

Okay. Bye.

<i>Your mom says Don't go
to Columbia with Candace.</i>

Don't go to Columbia...
Shut...

<i>Do you always want to
be a mama's boy, Derek?</i>

I am not a mama's boy.
Yes, you are!

Because Every single time I go to
your house, every single time...

Shut up, Candace!

...and you stand there
like a little beach...

Charlie, Charlie, just go.
I can handle it.

Just don't wake up mom and dad.

<i>Hey, look who's here.</i>

Welcome home, Aunt Helen!

Oh. Look at you guys,
dressed so nice.

Candace...

...what are you doing?

Look, I egged him on.

You saw it.
He's never hit me before.

And I promise you he'll
never hit me again.

Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

Charlie, this is Pony Tail Derek.

I can handle him.

Do you trust me?

Please, don't tell mom and dad.

Oh, my God.
They're playing good music.

Holy shit. Holy shit.
They are! They're playing good music.

Living room routine?

Living room routine!

Yes!
I'm sorry.

Excuse us! Excuse me!
I'm sorry!

Pardon me.
Sorry.

Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

God, it's freezing.

Ho, but you wore that toasty costume.

It's not like it's cute or original
you'd hope it'd be warm.

Yeah, piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.

Are you sure it's okay that I come?

Yeah, of course.
Just remember, Charlie...

Bob's not paranoid.
"He's sensitive."

Sam...

...that waitress from the Olive Garden,
she was such a tease.

Will you marry me?

Only with Patrick's blessing.
Patrick?

You're a hopeless stoner who
attends the culinary institute.

So, I'm gonna have to say
"no" on that, but nice try.

Charlie?
Oh, touché.

So, Charlie... this is a party.

This is what fun looks like.

Are you ready to meet
some desperate women?

Here, have a seat.

Hey, ladies, meet Charlie.

Hi.
Meet ladies.

Hey.

Mary Elizabeth.
Alice.

Nice to meet you.

This is Charlie's first party ever.

So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt
blow jobs from both of you.

Patrick, you're such a dick.
Where the hell did you go?

The dance was a little boring,
don't you think?

You're so selfish.
We looked everywhere for you.

You could have told someone.

Cry me a river.

How is it that you've got meaner
since becoming a Buddhist.

Just lucky I guess.

No, you're doing
something wrong, I think.

Or something very right.
Yeah, well...

Hey!

Look who's here!

Is that Brad Hays?

Yeah. He comes here sometimes.

But he's a popular kid.

Then, what are we?

Oh, Charlie, you look like
you could use a brownie.

Thank you.

I was so hungry at the dance.
I was gonna go to King's...

...but I didn't really have any time.

Thanks.

Have you guys felt this carpet?

This carpet feels so darn good.

Charlie. Charlie, what do you
think about high school?

High school?

Bullshit.

Cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center.

People wear their letter jackets
even when it's 98 degrees out.

And why do they give out
letter jackets for marching band?

It's not a sport, we all know it.

This kid is crazy.

Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
gonna regret that, you know...

...haircut when you
look back at old photographs.

I'm really sorry.
It sounded like a compliment in my head.

God!
Well, it's kind of true.

Shut up!

Bob, did you get him stoned?

Come on, Sam.
He likes it. Just look at him.

How do you feel, Charlie?

I just really want a milkshake.

Sam...

...you have such pretty brown eyes.

The kind of pretty that deserves
to make a big deal about itself.

You know what I mean?

Okay, Charlie.
Let me make the milkshake.

What a great word. Milkshake.

It's like when you say your name
over and over again in the mirror...

...and after awhile, it sounds crazy.

So, I'm guessing
you've never been high before?

No. No, no, no.

My best friend Michael.
His dad was a big drinker.

So, he hated all that stuff.

Parties, too.

Well, where is Michael tonight?

Oh, he shot himself last May.

Kinda wished he'd left a note.
You know what I mean?

Where's the bathroom?

It's up the stairs.
Thanks, Sam.

You're so nice.

Charlie.

Weird.

Oh!

Charlie?

Who is that kid?
Relax.

Relax. He's a friend of mine.

Stay here.

I didn't see anything.

Yeah, I know you saw
something, but it's okay.

Okay, listen...

Brad doesn't want anyone to know.

Wait...

Are you baked?
"Like a cake."

That's what Bob said.

And how you can't have 3 on a
match because then they'd find us.

And everyone laughed,
but I don't understand what's funny.

Okay, Charlie, listen.

I need you to promise...

...that you're not gonna say
anything to anyone about me and Brad.

Okay?
This has to be our little secret.

Our little secret.

Agreed.

Okay. Thank you.

We'll talk later.

I look forward to that big talk.

Isn't this the best milkshake ever, Alice?

It's even better than the first one.

I need to talk to you.

Charlie just told me that
his best friend shot himself.

I don't think he has any friends.

Hey. Everyone. Everybody.

Everyone.

Raise your glasses to Charlie.

What did I do?
You didn't do anything.

We just wanna toast to our new friend.

You see things.

And you understand.

You're a wallflower.

What is it? What's wrong?

I didn't think anyone noticed me.

Well, we didn't think there was
anyone cool left to meet.

So, Come on, everyone.

To Charlie.
To Charlie.

Welcome to the island of misfit toys.

Oh, my God. What is this song!?
Right? I have no idea.

Have you ever heard this before?

Never.

Patrick, We've gotta
go through the tunnel!

Sam, it's freezing.
Patrick, it's the perfect song!

No. Mama Patrick says no.

Patrick. Patrick, it's Sam.
It's Sam speaking to you...

...I'm begging you to...
I concede!

What is she doing?

Don't worry.
She does it all the time.

Turn it up!

You got it, your highness.

What?

I feel infinite.

<i>Dear Friend...</i>

<i>I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but
I've been trying hard not to be a loser.</i>

<i>For example, I am trying to participate...</i>

<i>...by listening to Sam's collection of big
rock ballads and thinking about love.</i>

<i>Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.</i>

<i>I completely agree.</i>

<i>I am also writing essays and
studying extra books outside of class.</i>

<i>As it turns out,
Mr. Anderson is a writer.</i>

<i>He even had a play put up in New York once,
which I think is very impressive.</i>

<i>He and his wife might
go back there after this year.</i>

<i>I know this is selfish,
but I really hope he doesn't.</i>

<i>My favorite time, though, is lunch
because I get to see Sam and Patrick.</i>

<i>We spend the time working
on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine...</i>

<i>...about music and
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</i>

<i>It's called Punk Rocky.</i>

<i>Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
because she is a Buddhist and a punk...</i>

<i>...but somehow she always acts like
my father at the end of a "long day."</i>

<i>Her best friend Alice loves vampires
and wants to go to film school.</i>

<i>She also steals jeans from the mall.</i>

<i>I don't know why because
her family is rich...</i>

<i>...but I'm trying not to be judgemental.</i>

<i>Especially since I know that they
were all there for Patrick last year.</i>

<i>Patrick never likes to be serious,
so it took me awhile to get what happened.</i>

<i>When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.</i>

<i>I guess it was hard, too...</i>

<i>...because Brad had to get drunk
every time they fooled around.</i>

<i>Then, Monday in school,
Brad would say:</i>

<i>"Man, I was so wasted.
I don't remember a thing."</i>

<i>This went on for 7 months.</i>

<i>When they finally did it,
Brad said he loved Patrick.</i>

<i>Then, he started to cry.</i>

<i>No matter what Patrick did,
Brad kept saying his dad would kill him.</i>

<i>And saying that he was going to hell.</i>

<i>Patrick was eventually
able to help Brad get sober.</i>

<i>I asked Patrick if he felt sad
that he still had to keep it a secret...</i>

<i>...and he said no...</i>

<i>...because at least now, Brad
doesn't have to get drunk to love him.</i>

<i>I think that I understand
because I really like Sam.</i>

<i>I asked my sister about her...</i>

<i>...and she said that
when Sam was a freshman...</i>

<i>...the upper classmen used to
get her drunk at parties.</i>

<i>I guess she had a reputation.</i>

<i>But I don't care.</i>

<i>I'd hate for her to judge me
based on what I used to be like.</i>

<i>So, I've been making her a mix tape
so she will know how I feel.</i>

Ah, shit!

<i>- C!
C!</i>

Give a K!
K!

Gimme a Y!
Y!

What's that spell!?
R-O-C-K-Y!

I can't hear you!
Rocky!

One more time!
Rocky!

# Whatever happened to Fae Wray? #

# That delicate, satin draped frame? #

# As it clung to her thigh

how I started to cry #

# 'cause I wanted to be dressed

just the same. #

# Give yourself over

to absolute pleasure #

# Swim the warm waters

of sins of the flesh #

# Erotic nightmares

beyond any measure #

# And sensual daydreams

to treasure forever #

# Can't you just see it? #

# Woah oh oh! #

# Don't Dream It

Be It #

<i>That picture is gorgeous, Craig.
What did you use?</i>

Oh, I know, thank you.

Color film, but black and
white paper for the printing.

Yeah. My professor gave me an "A,"
but for all the wrong reasons.

Most of them are idiots.

You'll see what I mean
when you get to college.

How did your SAT's go by the way?

1150.

I think I'll get into NYU.
Yeah, I hope so.

1490. Harvard. Face!

So, Are you okay?

Yeah. Yeah.

But I got my SAT results back.

Oops.

You can take them again, you know.

Yeah, it's just if I'm going
to Penn State main campus...

...I have to do much better.

I wish I would have
studied freshman year.

I was a bit of a mess.

I'll help you study for the next one.

Will you?
Yeah, of course.

Thanks, Charlie.

What's this?

Just a mix tape.
No big deal.

My parents have a pretty good stereo, so...

It's all about that night in the tunnel.

I couldn't find that song
we were listening to...

...but, you know, I'm still
searching for it, so...

It's okay.

These are great.

Nick Drake. The Shack's.

You have really good taste, Charlie.

Really?

Yeah.
Way better than me as a freshman.

I used to listen to the worst top 40.
No.

Yeah, I did.

Then I heard this old song.

Pearly Dew Drops Drop.

And I thought someday I would be
at a party in college or something.

And I'd look up and see
this person across the room.

And from that moment, I'd know
everything was going to be okay.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

I hope it works out.
I don't know.

Craig would be a big
step up from her last boyfriend.

No, shit.

Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?

I just hope she could stop
playing dumb with these guys.

I keep telling her...
don't make yourself small.

You can't save anybody.

Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.

How about something
a little bit more upbeat, huh?

So, Sam tells me
you want to be a writer.

Yeah.

Don't you write poetry, Craig?

Poetry writes me.
You know?

Let's get this party started.

That was fast.

You want another one?
Yeah.

Alright.

Mr. Anderson.

Can I ask you something?
Yeah.

Why do nice people choose
the wrong people to date?

Are we talking about anyone specific?

We accept the love we think we deserve.

Can we make them know
that they deserve more?

We can try.

Hey.
Hey! Hey, Sam.

I didn't see you come in.
How's it going?

You want to work on
probabilities and statistics?

Yeah, sure.

Page 391 on your book.

Hey, I ordered you some breakfast...

Dad, Can I have 30 dollars?

20 dollars?
What do you need 10 dollars for?

Sam is doing secret santa.

It's her favorite thing in the world.

Please.

Have fun.

Thanks.

Charlie!

This was my favorite book growing up.

This is my copy,
but I want you to have it.

Thanks.

Have a great Christmas break.

You too, Mr. Anderson.

Terrible stain.

That's pretty good, Charlie.

You've gotta be kidding me.

If you fail me,
you get me next semester.

C Minus!

Ladies and gentlemen,
I am below average!

Below average!
Below average!

Guys.1210.
What?

No more applications!

No more SAT's!

Thank you, Charlie!

Alright. Alright, guys. I got...

...multiple pairs of blue jeans.

Wow. This is a really tough one, but...

...I'm gonna have to guess... Alice.

Wait, guys... a receipt!
She actually paid!

Impossible!
I'm so touched.

Where's Craig?
Oh, he went home to Connecticut.

But he'll be back for New Year's Eve.

I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.

Who's your secret santa?
I'll tell you, Sam.

This one's tough.

I have received a harmonica,
a magnetic poetry set...

...a book about Harvey Milk...

...and a mix tape
with the song "Asleep" on it...

...twice.

I mean, I have no idea.

This collection of presents is so gay...

...that I think I must
have given them to myself.

But despite that distinct possibility...

...I'm gonna have to go with...

...drum roll...

Charlie.

Obviously.
Beautifully done.

Alright, Charlie. It's your turn.

Okey dokey.

Uh, I have received...

...socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt.

I was ordered to wear them all tonight.

So, I'm guessing my secret
santa is Mary Elizabeth.

Huh. Now, why do you say that?
I don't know.

You know,
She bosses people around sometimes.

What the hell is wrong with you?
Sorry.

You'll be surprised to know that
your secret santa is actually... me.

Why all the clothes?

Well, all the great writers
used to wear great suits.

So, your last present is on
a towel rack in the bathroom.

Delve into our facilities.

Emerge a star.

<i>Oh, Perfect!</i>

Will you hand these out while I'm gone?

Wait a second.
There's only secret santa presents.

There's rules, Charlie.

Mary Elizabeth, why are
you trying to eat Christmas?

Hand them out, Sam.

Alright.
Mary Elizabeth, for you.

Alice.
Thanks.

Bob.

And this one's for me.

"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."

40 dollars.

"To print Punk Rocky in color next time."

He knows me.

He really knows me.

Alright, Charlie.

Come on out.
Get out here, buddy.

Come on! Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie!

Charlie! Charlie!
Don't be shy.

Come out when...

Yeah!

What a display of man
I have ever seen!

Where are we going?
It's a surprise.

Is this your room?

It's so cool.

Thanks.

You got me a present?

After all your help on my
Penn State application?

Of course I did.

Open it.

I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything.

I'm really sorry we
can't be here for your birthday.

No, that's okay.

I'm just sorry you have to
go back and visit your dad.

I'm in such a great mood,
I don't think even he could ruin it.

I feel like I'm finally doing good.

You are.
Well, what about you?

When I met you,
you were this scared freshman.

Now look at you in that suit.

You're like a sexy English school boy.

I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
No.

Innocent.

Worst kind of guys.

Never see you coming.
And parents love you.

That's like...

...extra danger.

Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.

You've never had a girlfriend?

Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
No.

Have you ever kissed a girl?

No.

What about you?

Have I ever kissed a girl?
No, no! Your first kiss...

I was 11.

His name was Robert.

He used to come over to
the house all the time.

Was he your first boyfriend?

He was my...

He was my dad's boss.

You know Charlie, I used
to sleep with guys who...

...treated me like shit.

And get wasted all the time.

But now I feel like...

...I have a chance. Like I...

I could even get into a real college.

Well, it's true. You can do it.

You really think so?

My Aunt...

...had that same thing done to her, too.

And she turned her life around.

She must have been great.

She was my favorite person in the world...

...until now.

Charlie...

I know that you know I like Craig.

But I want to forget
that for a minute. Okay?

Okay.

I just wanna make sure that
the first person who kisses you...

...loves you.

Okay?

Okay.

I love you, Charlie.

I love you, too.

Have a good time at your mom's.

Thanks. And listen, Charlie...

...because your birthday
is on Christmas Eve...

...I figure you don't get
that many birthday presents.

I thought you should have my clock.
From the heart.

Thank you, Patrick.

Bye.
Bye.

Have a good one, guys!

I love you guys!

Hey!

Look who's here!

Come here, little sister.
Hey, Chris.

Hey, honey.

Ma, you look so thin!

Thank you.

Charlie...

Come I got dinner ready.
Oh, good.

Happy birthday.
Thanks.

Make a wish, honey.

<i>Can you see it, Charlie?</i>

The luminaria is a landing
strip for Santa Claus.

Why don't you keep an eye out for him...

...and I'll be right back, okay?

I'm going to get your birthday present.

Hey.

Hey.

God, I missed mom's cooking.

You have no idea how good you have it.

I'm actually beginning to hate pizza.

So how are you liking school?

Well, I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.

But I'm doing okay.

Okay?
You're playing in a Bowl Game.

How are you feeling, Charlie?

Good.

You know what I mean.

Is it bad tonight?

No. No.

I'm not picturing things anymore.

And even if I do, I can just shut it off.

Well, you know, mom did say that
you have good friends now.

And maybe if it does get bad again...

...you can just talk to them, yeah?
Yeah.

Especially Sam.

She's great.

I'm gonna ask her out at New Years.

Yeah, I think the time is right now.

How long does this take to work?

Shoveling snow, huh?

I have to get this driveway clean.

And then, I'm going
to congratulate you...

...on being happy
because you deserve it.

You said that an hour ago.
Was that tonight?

Oh, I just saw this tree,
but it was a dragon...

...and then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.

Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out.
Give me the...

Calm down.

Look up.

Isn't it quiet?

Sam, do you think that if people knew...

...how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?

All the time.

So, you wanna wear these glasses?

They'll protect you.

10-9-8-7-6...

...5-4-3-2-1...

It's gonna be our little secret.

...Happy New Year!

Did your older friends pressure you?

No one pressured me, officer.

I would never do drugs. Never.

Then, how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6 in the morning?

Well, I... you know, I was really tired...

...and I was feeling feverish.

So, I went outside for a walk,
just to get some cold air.

I started seeing things.
So, I passed out.

You're seeing things again, Charlie?

Not... Not really.

Nice suit.

It was a Christmas present.

Did you have fun on your break?

More fun than you're
gonna have today, Sinatra.

Nice look, jag off.

I called him 30 times.

Well what are we supposed to do?
We're going on in 10 minutes!

They said in health class...
Hello?

I know. They say that
about LSD just to scare you.

Are you sure?

Charlie, you're fine, man.

Guys, we have an emergency.

Craig has flaked out on us again.
So, I need a Rocky.

Brad?
No, No way.

No, I'm not...
There are people out here. No.

Charlie...

...take off your clothes.

# Then if anything grows
while you pose #

# I'll oil you up and drop you down #
# Down, Down Down #

# And that's just one small
fraction of the main attraction #

# You need a friendly hand #

# And I need action #

# Touch a touch a touch me #

# I wanna be dirty #

# Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill me #

# Creature of the night #

# Creature of our night #

# Creature of our night? #

# Creature of our night #

# Creature of our night #

# Creature of our night #

# Creature of our night #

# Creature of our night #

# Creature of our night #

Maybe I could join the cast as an
alternate or something?

Well, we're filled up now, but...

...they're gonna need people
when we go to college.

I could put in a good word for you.

That'd be great. Thanks.
Yeah.

Charlie...

Have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?

The one where the girl asks the guy.

Obviously, it is completely
stupid and sexist.

I mean it's like,
"Hey, thanks for the crumb."

And normally, I'd just blow it off
because school dances suck torture.

But, you know, it's my last year, and...

Would you maybe wanna go with me?
You wanna go with me?

I'm sick of macho guys.

Plus, you looked
really cute in your costume.

So, what do you say?

You must be Mary Elizabeth.
Yes.

It's so nice to meet you.
You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.

Please come in.
Okay.

A little closer together.
That looks nice.

Buddhist, I need you to smile
a little bit more. There you go. Nice.

Are you having a good time?

Not really. How about you?

I mean, I don't know.

It's my first date,
I don't know what to compare it to.

You're doing fine.

I'm sorry Craig couldn't come.

Yeah. He said he didn't want to
go to some stupid high school dance.

Can't say I blame him, really.

I don't know.
If you like it, he should come.

Thanks, Charlie.

Have a beautiful first date.
You deserve it.

I'll try not to make you too jealous.

Now, just let it breathe.

This is sure a nice house.

Thanks.

Don't you just love old music?

Yeah.

Good. Because I made you a mix of it.

I'd love to expose you to great things.

Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.

This merlot is really fancy.

Yeah. My dad collects wine,
but he doesn't drink.

It's kinda weird, isn't it?

I guess.

Where are your parents?

Their club is hosting
a cotillion or something racist.

They'll be gone all night.

That's sure a nice fire.

Yeah.

When I'm done being a lobbyist...

...I wanna move to a house
like this in Cape Cod.

Sounds nice, doesn't it?
Yeah.

Your heart is beating really fast.

Is it?

Here, feel.

Charlie?
Uh-huh.

Do you like me?
Uh-huh.

You know what I mean.

I think so.

Don't be nervous.

Charlie...

...I didn't know how tonight
was gonna go tonight, but...

...it was really nice, wasn't it?
Yeah.

I just can't believe it.

You of all people.

I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.

Shit!
My parents! Shit!

Here, zip this up!
Okay. No, no, I got this. Yeah.

Just zip it up, like a normal zipper!
Stuck. It's just...

Thank you.

See you Monday.

<i>Dear Friend...</i>

<i>I'm sorry I haven't
written for awhile, but...</i>

<i>...things are a total disaster.</i>

We're literally making out,
and I'm in my bra.

Hello! And the front door
opens. It's my parents!

<i>I probably should have been
honest about how I didn't...</i>

<i>...want to go out with Mary
Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...</i>

<i>...I really didn't want
to hurt her feelings.</i>

<i>You see, Mary Elizabeth
is a really nice person...</i>

<i>...underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.</i>

Hey!

<i>And since I heard that having
a girlfriend makes you happy...</i>

<i>...I tried hard to love her
like I love Sam.</i>

Can you believe it's almost
our two week anniversary?

Yeah, I know.

<i>So, I took her on double dates.</i>

Your first foreign film.

Do you want butter in your popcorn?
Vegans don't eat butter.

<i>And I tried not to mind that
she loves to hold hands...</i>

<i>...even when her hands are sweaty.</i>

<i>And I had to admit something
really upsetting. But...</i>

<i>I'm tired of touching her boobs.</i>

<i>I thought maybe if she
would just let me pick...</i>

<i>...the make-out music once in awhile,
we might have a chance.</i>

<i>And maybe if she didn't put down the
books that Mr. Anderson gives me.</i>

Walden?
I read this in 7th grade.

I would have called it
"On Boring Pond."

<i>Or if she would stop calling me
the minute I get home from school...</i>

<i>...when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.</i>

<i>Somehow she finds me things to say.</i>

<i>That dairy just sits with you.
You know, it walks with you.</i>

She's on the phone right now?

Charlie, you've gotta break up with her.

I can do that?

For Christ's sake...
I need to use the phone!

<i>I'll give you this book.
It's really how I became a vegan...</i>

<i>I know I should have been honest...</i>

<i>...but I was getting so mad,
it was starting to scare me.</i>

<i>I just wish I could have found
another way to break up.</i>

Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you...
Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.

<i>You know I hate that.</i>

<i>In hindsight, I probably
could not have picked...</i>

<i>...a worse way to be honest
with Mary Elizabeth.</i>

Truth or dare?
Who are you talking to?

I dare you... to kiss Alice.

Courage your lions, procreator.

Mary Elizabeth?

Samantha told me that
you got into Harvard.

Congratulations.
Thank you.

This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.

But I forgive you.

Hey, don't worry about Penn State.

You're just wait-listed.
Yeah.

You guys are about to miss
some severely hot "fag on goth" action.

Get a room!
You're a monster!

My turn. Um... let's see...

Let's think... Charlie?

Truth.
How's your first relationship going?

It's so bad...

...that I keep fantasizing that
one of us is dying of cancer...

...so that I don't have to
break up with her.

Charlie?

Truth or dare?
Hello?

Dare.
Okay.

I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl
in the room on the lips.

And notice I charitably
said girl and not person...

...because let's face it,
I'd smoke all you bitches.

Now that's fucked up.

Mary Elizabeth...

I'm so sorry.

It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

Sam! Sam!

I really didn't mean
anything by it. I'm sorry.

What the hell is wrong with you?

I should go back and apologize.

No, Charlie, Trust me.
You don't want to go back there.

But, I'm really sorry.

I didn't mean to do anything...

I know you didn't...

...but look.

I hate to be the one to break this...

...but there's history with
Mary Elizabeth and Sam.

Other guys.

Things that have nothing
to do with you.

But it's best if you stay away for awhile.

Oh, Okay.

How long do you think?

<i>Dear friend, I have not seen
my friends for 2 weeks now.</i>

<i>I am starting to get bad again.</i>

Charlie. Come on, get dressed.

We're going to be late for Easter Mass.

I'll... I'll be there in a minute.

Our Father who art in Heaven.

Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.

And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us...

Mary Elizabeth...

I've been listening to the
Billie Holiday CD like every night...

It's too late, Charlie.

Look, I know. I just feel really
bad about what I did.

I just get so messed up inside
like I'm not there or something.

Tell it to someone who cares.

I know. I'm sorry. I just...
We've all become such good friends...

Good friends?

Do you mean the people that
I've known since kindergarten...

...and you've known for 6 months?
Those good friends?

Yeah. I mean I just don't want to
do anything to ruin our relat...

It's ruined. Okay?
So, stop calling everyone.

Stop embarrassing yourself.

Okay. I will. Goodb...

Something's wrong with me.

Don't worry about it.

Hey, you heard from Patrick?

No. He told me to stay away.

Oh. You don't know?

Why? Why? What happened?

Brad's father caught them together.

<i>- Some kids jumped him outside the O.
It was some kids from North Hills.</i>

<i>Did you see his face?</i>

<i>- What happened?
It's not what I heard.</i>

Are you okay?
Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.

Hey, nothing.

Sorry, Nothing.

You gonna do anything?
What are you talking about?

I'm talking about your
pet ape just tripped me.

Are you gonna say something?

Why would I?
You know why.

This is pathetic, man.
Your fixation on me.

Do you want your friends to know
how you got those bruises? Really?

I got jumped in a parking lot.
Where? Schenley Park?

Do you guys know about Schenley Park?

I don't know what kind of
sick shit you're trying to pull.

But you better walk away now...

...Nothing.

Fine.

Say hi to your dad for me.

Whatever, faggot.

What did you just call me?
I called you a faggo...

Say that shit again!
Say that shit again!

It's Patrick!

No! No!

Stop! Please, they don't stop!

Touch my friends again
and I'll blind you.

Charlie?
Yeah?

Thanks for stopping them.

Sure, Brad.

How you doing, Charlie?

I don't know.

I keep trying, but I can't
really remember what I did.

Do you want me to tell you?

Yeah.

You saved my brother.

That's what you did.

So, you're not gonna scare of me?
No.

Can we be friends again?

Of course.

Come on.

Let's go be psychos together.

I'm dating Peter now.

He's in college with Craig.

He's opinionated, and we
have intellectual debates.

You were very sweet, but our
relationship was too one-sided.

I know this is hard for you.

I'm just glad you're happy.

Okay.

Hey, Craig, Sam will be down soon.

We're gonna miss the movie.

Yeah, I'll go put
some pep in her step.

Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

Sure, Patrick

I'll tell you something, Charlie.
I feel good.

You know what I mean?

And maybe tomorrow I'll take you
to this karaoke place downtown.

And this club off the strip.
They don't card.

And the Schenley Park scene.

You have to see the
"fruit loop" at least one time.

Oh, my God.

My life is officially
an after school special.

Son of a bitch!

It really is.

It so is.

So, you ever hear the
one about Lily Miller?

I don't know.
Really?

I thought your brother would
have told you. It's a classic.

Maybe.
Okay.

Lily comes here one night
with this guy Parker.

And this was to be the night that
they were gonna lose their virginity.

So, she did it really proper.
She packed a picnic.

Stole a bottle of wine.

Everything was perfect,
and they're just about to 'do it'...

...when they realize they
forgot the condoms.

So, what do you think happened?
I don't know.

They did it with one of the sandwich bags.

Ew!

Oh, that's disgusting!
Yes! It is!

Come on.
Let's keep the train rolling.

Suburban legend. Charlie!

Well...

There was this girl named
Second Base Stace.

And... well, She had boobs
in the like 4th grade...

Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.

And she let some
of the guys feel them.

That's your suburban legend?

Did you at least cop a feel?
Yeah.

No.
No, of course not.

You went home,
listened to "Asleep", wrote a poem...

Fine! Okay. Your turn.

Yeah, I've got one.

Well...

There was this one guy.
Queer as a 3 dollar bill.

The guy's father
doesn't know about his son.

So, he comes
into the basement one night...

...when he's supposed to be out of town.

Catches his son with another boy.

So, he starts beating him.

But not like the slap kind.
Like the real kind.

And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."

But the son just yells "Get out."

And...

...eventually...

...the boyfriend just did.

Why can't you save anybody?

I don't know.

Forget it.

I'm free now, right?

I could meet the
love of my life any second.

Things will be different now,
and that's good.

I just need to meet a good guy...

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

It's alright.

It's alright.

<i>I've been spending
a lot of time with Patrick.</i>

<i>He begins every night really excited.</i>

<i>He always says he feels free,
and tonight is his destiny.</i>

<i>But after awhile, he runs out
of things to keep himself numb.</i>

<i>Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.</i>

"We will require you to take our
summer session at the main campus...

...immediately following your
high school graduation."

She got in, Charlie.

<i>After that all Patrick could talk about
was college and all their futures.</i>

<i>Alice did get into NYU Film School.</i>

<i>Patrick is going to the
University of Washington...</i>

<i>...because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.</i>

<i>But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.</i>

<i>Sam is going to leave
right after graduation.</i>

<i>It all feels very exciting.</i>

<i>I just wish it were happening to me.</i>

<i>Especially because ever since
I blacked out in the cafeteria...</i>

<i>...it's been getting worse.</i>

<i>And I can't turn it off this time.</i>

Guys, you want to pass your copies
of Gatsby up to the front please?

And I know it's the last day...

...but if we could just
keep it to a dull roar...

...I'd appreciate it.

Thank you.

Guys, guys,
Thank you for such a great year.

I had a blast.
I hope you did, too.

And I hope you have a great time
this summer on your vacations.

Now, who here is gonna read
for pleasure this summer?

Charlie, Very good.

Last day.

Yeah.

So, I know it's none of my business,
but have you decided?

I mean, are you going to New York?

Well, my wife and I like it here.

And I think I might be better
at teaching than writing.

You know, Charlie.
I was thinking that...

...Maybe I could still give
you books next year.

Yeah. Yeah.

I think you could write
one of them one day.

Really?

I do.

You're the best teacher I've ever had.

Thank you.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

...5, 4, 3, 2...

Let's get the hell out of here!
One!

<i>Dear Friend...</i>

<i>I wanted to tell you about us running.</i>

<i>There was this beautiful sunset.</i>

<i>And just a few hours
before, everyone I love...</i>

<i>...had their last day
of high school ever.</i>

<i>And I was happy
because they were happy...</i>

<i>...even though I counted,
and I have...</i>

<i>...1,095 days to go.</i>

<i>I kept imagining what school
would be like without them...</i>

<i>...as they they were all
getting ready for their prom.</i>

<i>My sister finally decided
to break up with Derek...</i>

<i>...and go stag with her
girlfriends instead.</i>

<i>And then there was Sam.</i>

<i>I've looked at her
pictures since that night.</i>

<i>I like to see how happy
she was before she knew.</i>

<i>They were in a hotel suite after prom
when the truth came out...</i>

<i>Basically, Craig has been
cheating on Sam the whole time.</i>

<i>When I heard that, I kept thinking
about the happy girl in these pictures.</i>

<i>Because she doesn't
have 1,095 days to go.</i>

<i>She made it.</i>

<i>This is her time.</i>

<i>And no one should be
able to take that away.</i>

Congratulations.
Oh, Charlie! Charlie's here!

Guys, group photo!

We should all take a group photo.

Oh, get against the railing
and try to look suave!

Yeah, this is the one.
That's gonna be a great angle.

<i>At her going away party...</i>

<i>...I wanted her to know about that night
we went through the tunnel.</i>

<i>And how for the first time,
I felt like I belonged somewhere.</i>

<i>And tomorrow, she's leaving.</i>

<i>So, I wanted to give her a part of me.</i>

Are these all your books, Charlie?

Thanks for staying up with me.
Sure.

My brother said Penn State has this
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.

You have to get a grilled
stickie on your first night.

It's a tradition.

That sounds like fun.
Yeah.

Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
new group of friends, you know.

You won't even think
about this place anymore.

Yes, I will.

I had lunch with Craig today.

Yeah?

He said he was sorry and that...

...I was right to break up with him.

I'm driving away,
and I'm just feeling so small.

Just asking myself
why do I and everyone I love...

...pick people who
treat us like we're nothing?

We accept the love we think we deserve.

Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?

I, uh...

I just didn't think that you wanted that.

Well, what did you want?

I just want you to be happy.

Don't you get it, Charlie?

I can't feel that.

It's really sweet and everything, but...

...you can't just sit there and
put everybody's lives ahead of yours...

...and think that counts as love.

I don't wanna be somebody's crush.

I want people to like the real me.

I know who you are, Sam.

I know I'm quiet...

...and I know I should speak more...

...but if you knew the things that...

...that were in my head
most of the time, you'd know...

...what it really meant.

How much we are alike.

And how we've been
through the same things.

And you're not small.

You're beautiful.

What's wrong, Charlie?
Oh, nothing.

Promise you're gonna call.

You know I'm gonna call you all the time.

We'll all see each other in New York.
All the time.

Come on, Sam.

What's wrong, Charlie?

Put your seat belt on.
We'll meet you there.

Don't wake your sister.

It'll be our little secret, okay?

<i>Look, Charlie.
She's fast asleep.</i>

<i>Don't wake your sister.</i>

My fault.
My fault.

<i>My fault.
It was all my fault.</i>

<i>It'll be our little secret, okay?</i>

<i>Stop it.</i>

<i>Stop.</i>

Stop crying.

Stop crying.

<i>It'll be our little secret.</i>

Candace, your brother's on the phone.

Hello.

Hey, Candace.
Charlie?

<i>Sam and Patrick left, and...</i>

<i>...I just can't stop
thinking about something.</i>

What?

<i>Candace...</i>

<i>...I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?</i>

<i>She died getting my birthday present,
so I guess I killed her, right?</i>

<i>I've tried to stop
thinking that, but I can't.</i>

<i>She keeps driving away...</i>

...and dying over and over.
Call the police and send them to my house.

And I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
No, Charlie, listen to me.

Mom and dad are going to be
home with Chris any second.

<i>I was just thinking...
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?</i>

What? Charlie? Charlie!

Charlie?

I'm Dr. Burton.

Where am I?

Mayview hospital.

You have to let me go.
My dad can't afford it.

Don't worry about that.
No.

I saw them when I was little.

And I don't want to be a Mayview kid.

Just tell me how to stop it.

Stop what?

Seeing it.

All their lives. All the time.

Just... how do you stop seeing it?

Seeing what, Charlie?

There is so much pain.

And I don't know
how to not notice it.

What's hurting you?

No! Not me.
It's them. It's everyone.

It never stops.

Do you understand?

What about your Aunt Helen?

What about her?

You see her?

Yes.

She had a terrible life.

But... I mean, what am I...

You said some things
about her in your sleep.

I... I don't care.

If you want to get better...

...you have to.

She...

She was insane.

She...

Charlie, are you gonna
let me help you here?

Okay.

Do you remember anything
before you blacked out?

I remember leaving Sam's house...

...and walking home and...

<i>I was in the hospital for awhile.</i>

<i>I won't go into detail about all of it.</i>

<i>But I will say there were
some very bad days.</i>

<i>And some unexpected beautiful days.</i>

<i>The worst day was the time...</i>

<i>...my doctor told my mom and
dad what Aunt Helen did to me.</i>

Honey?

I'm so sorry.

<i>The best days were those
when I could have visitors.</i>

<i>My brother and sister
always came for those...</i>

<i>...until Chris had to
go to training camp.</i>

<i>He's going to be first string this year.</i>

<i>And my sister told me
she met a nice guy at her summer job.</i>

There he is.

So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right?

<i>My doctor said we can't
choose where we can come from...</i>

<i>...but we can choose
where we go from there.</i>

<i>I know it's not all the answers...</i>

<i>...but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together.</i>

God bless food
we are about to receive.

We thank You for this bounty in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.
Amen.

So, how do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, dad?

God damn Penguins.

I think they're allergic
to God damn defense.

What do the players call a puck again?

A biscuit.

Are you sure it's not
a "God damn biscuit?"

You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

Honey, I think we're gonna have
to do a little shopping for you...

...before you take off, huh?

I need some books...

Can Charlie come out and play?

That first night, we had grilled stickies.

It was so good.

You have to visit in the Fall.
We'll have some. Okay?

Definitely.

Oh, sorry. Charlie has
a breakdown scheduled for October.

Well, can I tell you something?

I've been away for two months.

It's another world.
And it gets better.

And my roommate Katie
has the best taste in music.

I found the tunnel song.

Let's drive.

<i>I don't know if I will have the
time to write any more letters...</i>

<i>...because I might be too
busy trying to participate.</i>

<i>So, if this does end up
being the last letter...</i>

<i>...I just want you to know that I was in a
bad place before I started high school.</i>

<i>And you helped me.</i>

<i>Even if you didn't know
what I was talking about.</i>

<i>Or know someone who's gone through it.</i>

<i>It made me not feel alone.</i>

<i>Because I know there are people who
say all of these things don't happen.</i>

<i>And there are people who forget what
it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.</i>

<i>I know these will all
be stories someday.</i>

<i>And our pictures will
become old photographs.</i>

<i>And we'll all become
somebody's mom or dad.</i>

<i>But right now,
these moments are not stories.</i>

<i>This is happening.
I am here.</i>

<i>And I am looking at her.</i>

<i>And she is so beautiful.</i>

<i>I can see it.</i>

<i>This one moment when you
know you're not a sad story.</i>

<i>You are alive.</i>

<i>And you stand up and see
the lights on buildings...</i>

<i>...and everything that makes you wonder.</i>

<i>And you are listening to
that song on that drive...</i>

<i>...with the people
you love most in this world.</i>

<i>And in this moment, I swear...</i>

<i>...we are infinite.</i>
