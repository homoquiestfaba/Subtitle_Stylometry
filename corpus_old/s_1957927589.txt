Please. Please.
Please, no.

Please. Please.

No. Please. Please.
Please. Please don't.

Please.
No, no, please.

Don't-- don't do that!

Please, John,
just let me talk to him. Okay?

<i>Absolutely fucking not.</i>

Come on.
It's been months.

-You don't even care, do you?
-I care.

I care.
What do you think I'm--

-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

No, that's part of
what I'm talking about. Okay?

The only person that
matters to Rachel is Rachel.

Where is it? Hmm?

Give it to me now.

Oh, is this
where we are going?

Yeah.

Okay. Slow it down there.

You know what?

You are such
a fucking pussy.

Baby, come on.
Why would I--

You're a whore not a thief.
Give me the fucking ring now.

<i>No.</i>
Yeah.

Well, I am his mother, okay?
And he's my only baby.

<i>You had your chance.</i>
<i>You fucked it up.</i>

That is not fair. And that--
and you know that's not true.

Nothing? I'm walking out
right now, you got nothing?

Let me see this purse.
Give me this-- ow!

You wanna hit, huh?

I paid you to leave,
not to steal my shit.

I said slow it down.

I'm not a fucking whore.

Dude, what the fuck?
Come on.

So you know what?
You pay for it for once.

<i>You're a fucking psycho.</i>

<i>-You're a fucking psycho.</i>
<i>-Stay out.</i>

<i>Don't ever</i>
<i>fucking call me again.</i>

<i>You're such</i>
<i>a fucking psycho.</i>

<i>And you know something, you're</i>
<i>not gonna bring her back,</i>

<i>and it's your fucking fault</i>
<i>you drunk piece of shit.</i>

<i>Keep walking.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I was just playing around.</i>

<i>Fuck you.</i>

<i>Jojo, good, copy.</i>

<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

<i>JoJo.</i>
<i>This is Stalker Two.</i>

<i>Standing by for timeline.</i>
<i>All copy? Over.</i>

<i>Stalker Two, solid copy.</i>

<i>Stand by for Stalker One.</i>

, <i>go.</i>
<i>Stay frosty, motherfuckers.</i>

<i>Proceed with plan.</i>

<i>Stalker Two, roger that.</i>

General Santiago
is calling in, sir.

Patch him in.

General Santiago,
Colonel Roake reporting.

<i>At ease Colonel.</i>

<i>Status report?</i>

Sir, I have five fresh
new assignments inbound

and Chief Woodman
is en route.

<i>Copy. ETA?</i>

Five mikes, sir.

<i>Is that Israeli</i>
<i>bitch there yet?</i>

Thank you
for the compliment.

<i>- Wasn't a compliment.</i>
No?

Where I come from, if you're
referred to as a bitch

means you're doing your job.

<i>Then</i>
<i>you should get a promotion.</i>

<i>Just stay the fuck</i>
<i>out of the way.</i>

<i>You've done your part.</i>
<i>Now let us do ours.</i>

We'll do the right thing
at whatever cost.

<i>Keep me posted,</i>
<i>Colonel Roake.</i>

Copy that, sir.

<i>I hand-picked you</i>
<i>for this program. You get it?</i>

<i>Don't drop the ball</i>
<i>on me now.</i>

<i>Too close</i>
<i>to the finish line.</i>

<i>I want a status report</i>
<i>in 48 hours</i>

<i>and a clinical eval</i>
<i>on Woodman post hunt.</i>

Understood.

<i>This man in particular</i>

<i>is of special interest to us,</i>
<i>Marcus Woodman.</i>

<i>You do well for him,</i>

<i>there may be</i>
<i>a brigadier general spot</i>

<i>in our covert ops unit</i>
<i>here in Washington.</i>

I know the stakes.

<i>Good. Carry on.</i>

Great day.

Woodman's transport
is ten minutes out, sir.

I want you
to keep an eye on it.

<i>You're gonna love it.</i>
<i>Trust me.</i>

Okay. Now I know that you said
you don't wanna do anything,

but...

here you go.

Stop.

<i>Blue Jay 1, out copy, over.</i>

Babe, you okay?

-Babe.
-Get--

-Babe, it's just a present.
-Just get away.

-Babe.
-Jess, get away.

-Get away. Get away. Get out.
-Babe? Marcus!

Just get out.
Get out. Get out.

<i>It's just a box, Marcus.</i>

<i>Marcus, please,</i>
<i>it's just a box.</i>

<i>Get out!</i>

<i>Please. Please, calm down.</i>

<i>Please, make it stop.</i>

<i>Please, it's just a box.</i>

<i>Please, calm down. Please.</i>

Sir.
Top, come in.

-Thank you, sir.
-I called you here

because I wanna talk to you
about our new recruit.

We really need this one.

Washington
is telling us that

if we pull this off
without a glitch...

we get fully funded.

Dream come true, sir.

That it is.

We pulled all the footage from
various devices in the home.

Senior Chief Marcus Woodman.

<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

Uh, it's my husband.

He has locked himself
in the bathroom with his gun.

Please help.

Marcus.

No, I don't know.

I mean, he's talking
but not to me.

Marcus, please.
Just come out baby. Please.

I know you're in there.
Come back to me.

I need you, Marcus.
I want you.

Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.

<i>Never scare me</i>
<i>like that again, please, babe.</i>

Sir, it's hard to believe
all those stories.

Yeah, well you better believe
them 'cause they're all true.

Behavioral avoidance
can happen to the best of them.

The man spent
the last four months

at AMACORP's
Prime Psych Facility

being probed and tested
and evaluated.

Voodoo bullshit
if you ask me.

Now, it's up to us to
get him back in the saddle...

for Ghost.

Ghost Recon.

Exactly.

Never met anyone up
for that.

And Top,
you and I we pull this off,

it's gonna be
a huge win for both of us.

Sir, he's arrived.
Would you like him here?

That's fine.
Sir.

Damn! I'm good.

I mean, it was okay.

I mean, just five out of
five cans okay or was it--

-Easy.
-I got it. It's okay.

I know, I just--

Uh...

Anyway, do you wanna go set
the cans back up or?

Yeah. For you.

Oh, no, I'm not really
feeling it today.

Look, if you don't
wanna talk about it,

you don't have to,
but you can.

I don't know.

I just, uh...

it's like doing good
doesn't feel good anymore.

Like the right thing
became the wrong thing...

if that makes any sense.

I mean,
if it makes sense to you,

then that's all that matters.

And maybe you could
go to that place

and you could talk to somebody
and maybe they'll understand.

Hmm.

Either way.
I'm here for you.

You got this.

The wife?

She passed away unfortunately
a while after he got out.

I think it's why
he joined the program.

Nothing left
for him at home.

That's tough stuff
right there.

Yeah, it is.

Is he on board?

He will be.

Once he sees
it's not about him,

it's about the men and women
who will come after him.

He is a soldier.

He's not just any soldier.

The man
is an exceptional Navy Seal.

This is the fast track
back to where he belongs.

-Hey, I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

Yeah.

You go deal with your friends.
They're here for you.

I'm here for you.

Thanks.

Mind if I
hang out over here?

Mingling is not
really my thing.

Sure, I'm just
flipping these burgers

pretending like I know
what I'm doing.

Honestly, I like it.

Greg.

Marcus, nice to meet you.

Like the poet king.

-Or the assassin.
-Oh, yeah.

Depends on
how you look at it I guess.

That's true.

Thanks for not
saying that.

Saying what?

Uh, when people meet me,

they usually can't wait
to get it out.

Thank you
for your service.

Uh, yeah.
You guys don't like that.

And I don't blame you.

I think living a good life
is the best thanks I can give.

Exactly.

Jess said
you're getting out?

That's the plan.

Took you long enough.

What's that?

To get here.

Car trouble?

I'll drive next time.

Shit.

Heard about your wife.

She's why I'm here.

I never picked
one up along the way.

It's too much to carry.

-We ready to go?
-You know that mission.

Is it true?

What's it to you, man?

It's just,
you know, over 200 kills.

You go on
a Rambo and shit.

And then, of course, you had
to put down your own objective.

It's too wounded
to move so they say.

So they say.

You know, that's the thing
about Lone Survivor missions.

It's only ever one version
of the story, yours.

Ops aren't always clean.

Oh, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

I can see that.

You know, the most
dangerous animal in the world,

it's a desperate one.

Had a mission like
yours once, Siberia,

three days
in the mountains.

Snowstorm.
Signal was shit.

Intel was wrong,
like usual.

We were hurt,
bleeding bad, no ammo.

The forest was too thick
to land anything in.

So we had to climb
to elevation.

Snow you've never seen
in your fucking life.

About 15 hours in
we start getting tracked

by a pack of wolves.

Wolves.

It doesn't happen
like you think.

They don't come fast,
they wait.

They stalk you.
They scout ahead.

They find the perfect
ground to attack.

Just like us.

My team and I, we took
a stand and we waited.

Those wolves knew
what it was too.

'Cause here comes the biggest
motherfucker they got.

Gray, this black chest...

these big yellow eyes.

I knew when
I saw that motherfucker

a sacrifice would have
to be made one way or another.

I let him get close.

And when he launched
I stuck my hand

in that motherfuckers mouth
and I pulled him close.

I was the last thing
he ever saw.

So I'm still breathing
and he's not.

-Lucky for you.
-You know,

they talk like
you're some big hero.

Well, my team is still alive,
your guy isn't.

<i>Claver, ready for Woodman.</i>

Time to let
the dog off the leash.

You're wrong.

How's that?

The most dangerous animal,
it isn't the desperate one.

It's one
with nothing to lose.

Ready?
One, two.

I'll get him back to you

after I debrief him.

Top, take care of him.
Will you?

Copy that sir.

Thank you.

Chief.

I'm Colonel Roake.

Good to meet you, son.

Come on in.

<i>Welcome to the new</i>

<i>AMACORP Hunting Program.</i>

<i>The ultimate hunting</i>
<i>experience for veterans.</i>

<i>Your mission,</i>
<i>to hunt down all civilians</i>

<i>and execute them.</i>

How you doing, son?

Fine.
Just ready to go.

-You packed and strapped?
-Of course.

Checked it twice
like I have been trained to.

-Stay alert.
-Stay alive.

You know,
nerves are good.

-Keeps you sharp.
-I'm not nervous.

Hey, Top,
you mind if I have a word?

Yeah.

So, Marcus Woodman?

Yeah.

To be honest.

I've heard some
wild ass shit about him.

Hmm.
I hear ya.

But we're the only ones who
can relate to this man, right?

Like him or not,
he's one of ours.

He's not one of mine.

You kill one of our own,
there's no excuse. Not for me.

Yeah.

Hey.

Hey.
Hello.

Hey.
Hello.

Help.

Oh, God. Help.
Help me. Help me, please.

Please.
Please, get me out of here.

Please. Please. Please.

Why does my head hurt?

Please help me out of here.
Please.

I don't fucking know.

I didn't do anything, please.

Just calm down. Just calm down.

Shut up, bitch!

Please, somebody help.

Help!
Hey! Somebody!

Let me out!

It was just me
and my boyfriend

and we were having dinner
and then, uh--

Yeah, let-- let's start to--
I-- I was out at the bar.

Yo, I don't remember shit.

I-- I had just--
I was coming home from work.

Let me out!

Let me out! Let me out!

Keep it down, man.
We're being watched.

What?

Look, we're being watched.

We're being watched.
Look there. Look. Look.

Somebody,
anybody, let me out now.

Help us!
Hello! Help!

What number hunt
is this for you?

I don't know.
A few dozen.

And, um, how has your home life
been since treatment?

Excellent, honestly.

Professionally?

Better than ever.

So don't you think
it would be fair

if we give this man
the same chances we gave you?

Yeah, you're right.

I just had
to say something.

Woodman will mainly be
with me and Junior today

I'll keep
an eye on him.

How's the little
dumb dumb doing?

He's wound a little
tight right now,

but that's how it goes.

His results will come
once he's been in the hot seat.

Then we'll see if this
is preventative as well.

The fuck are you?

What the fuck?
Get off me.

Hey, hey.
Fuck you man.

Seriously?
Answer me. Hey, hey.

Don't fucking care.

Help me.

Can you just
tell me what's going on?

What's going on?

Person to person, please.

They are ready.

<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the Stalking Fields Program</i>

<i>for which</i>
<i>you've been selected.</i>

<i>I'm sure many</i>
<i>of you have questions,</i>

<i>but now is not the time.</i>

What the fuck?

<i>We here,</i>
<i>along with the US military,</i>

<i>are part of a brand new</i>
<i>treatment program.</i>

<i>Experimental.</i>
<i>And it's working.</i>

Okay.

<i>The program's trying</i>
<i>to bring our best</i>

<i>and bravest soldiers</i>
<i>back into fight.</i>

What are you
talking about?

<i>I'm talking about serving</i>
<i>those who have served you.</i>

<i>Giving you an opportunity</i>
<i>for a good life,</i>

<i>an opportunity</i>
<i>that none of you took.</i>

<i>The program will start</i>
<i>16 minutes after your release.</i>

<i>Here is where I'm sure</i>
<i>you will have many questions.</i>

I just wanna go home.

No, no, no. You have--
you have the wrong people.

Okay. I haven't done
anything wrong. Please.

<i>You see,</i>
<i>there are no accidents.</i>

<i>Each of you,</i>
<i>you're all here for a reason.</i>

<i>Rachel, for instance,</i>

<i>embezzlement</i>
<i>of your own family business</i>

<i>a fraud of $3 million.</i>

Hey.
<i>- Lance,</i>

<i>DUI, aggravated assault,</i>
<i>manslaughter.</i>

<i>-Wow.</i>
-Fuck this and fuck you.

This is deranged.

<i>Sara, another addict</i>

<i>whose child</i>
<i>is taken from her.</i>

<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I could go on, shall I?</i>

<i>None of you here</i>
<i>are special.</i>

<i>But you have</i>
<i>a chance to be.</i>

<i>A chance to reclaim</i>
<i>your life, fresh start.</i>

<i>Participate and survive,</i>

<i>each of you will earn</i>
<i>your own identity,</i>

<i>$500,000, and passage</i>
<i>to anywhere inside</i>

<i>the US</i>
<i>that you choose.</i>

Hey, what
the fuck does that mean?

What if we say, "Fuck this,
fuck you," and don't do shit?

<i>Well, I should tell you</i>
<i>that each of you</i>

<i>have a nano thermic</i>
<i>explosive in your brain.</i>

<i>It's a tiny explosive,</i>
<i>but remote controlled.</i>

What?

<i>Should you choose</i>
<i>not to participate?</i>

<i>Well, I can end your life.</i>
<i>It's nothing to me.</i>

Holy shit.
God.

<i>And finally,</i>
<i>I want to express</i>

<i>our gratitude</i>
<i>for your service.</i>

<i>Testing on humans</i>
<i>has always had</i>

<i>the quickest gains</i>
<i>in medical knowledge.</i>

<i>And for that,</i>
<i>I want to say thank you</i>

<i>for making</i>
<i>the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

What? Ultimate sacrifice.
What does that mean?

<i>Zimieski, please escort them</i>

<i>through the SW</i>
<i>tunnel to begin.</i>

<i>Oh, and good luck.</i>

Don't fucking
think about it.

Anybody else?

Get up.

Get up against the wall.

Hey, shit head.

Scoot over, Jesus.
You wanna see something?

-What is it?
-My hunt?

No, not really.

Why not?

You know what?
Guess I'm kinda over

watching other people
get the experience.

I hear you.
And trust me, I get it.

I wish that I would've
started off the way you are.

Participation first,
kill later.

Death is a motherfucker.

Without the right people,
it'll really fuck you up.

Yeah, I get it.

I'm kind of tired
of the excuses.

Some people wanna kill.

Okay.
And what if they don't?

Really?

No one's ever thought
they'd be good at killing

and actually been right
about themselves?

Jesus H-- well,
I mean, here's the deal,

Princess,
you're in a bit of a mood.

So I'm gonna help less and
I'm gonna kick it over here.

But just don't forget

I can whoop
your fucking ass, all right?

Sure, sure, sure.
Just know I can handle it.

Handle what, boy?

Kill, Dad.
I'm fucking ready, man.

You have me
sitting here in the wings.

I mean, how are
we supposed to know

if it's preventative treatment
if we don't test it out?

I know corporate's on your ass
but I'm fucking sick--

I don't care
what AMACORP says.

You'll go
when I say you're ready.

Don't worry about Woodman.

You will go soon.

<i>You have made it</i>

<i>to the final stage</i>
<i>of your treatment.</i>

<i>Now go enjoy yourself</i>
<i>and have a happy hunt.</i>

That's exactly
what we do here.

Now, you know.

No more rumors
or whisperings in your command.

This is it.
Soft combat.

It's why there's
so much hardware.

Your support staff
is beyond excellent.

While somewhat controversial,
these methods have been, well,

beyond expectation
in terms of results.

We get our soldiers
back to work,

whether it's
for the country or for us.

That's all well and good but
the real question here is...

are you willing
to do the work necessary

to get back out
where you belong?

Because son,
your-- your dossier is--

Excellent.

That it is.

But it's not
just about you,

it's about a lot of other
men and women like you.

The data
we retrieve in the field,

it dramatically improves
our entire process.

So if you ever
wanna make a difference,

here's your chance.

Does it work?
Yes, it does.

This is something
to be proud of, son.

Talked and thought enough
the last few months.

Let's get on with it.

You heard the man,
let's get on with it.

Protocol is as follows.

You'll have
exactly 60 minutes

to get a head start
before your team gets their OP.

-Fuck this shit, man.
-Fucking serious?

Let's do this.

-Okay.
-Okay.

How do we survive
something like this?

Just make it
to the river.

I'll get you,
you piece of shit.

-Stop.
-I swear.

-Stop. Stop. Stop.
-You don't even fucking know.

I'll come for you, you fuck.
Please stop.

Please. You--
you don't have to do this.

You can just--
you just let us go.

You better hurry.

Kill the music.

No need.

Up, rest.

Chief, you can settle
in here with your support team.

Gentlemen, ladies,

you all know the drill.

This man is in the final phases
of his treatment,

which means
he needs our help.

So, we're gonna do
everything within our power

to make sure we get him
back in the saddle.

Is that clear
with all of you?

Yes, sir.

I expect it
to be done.

-Good luck.
-Sir.

Welcome.

Make yourself at home.

We're still
a little ways out

so you help yourself
to anything.

Thank you.

Welcome, brother.
Good to have you.

You boys kissing?

You'd like that, wouldn't you?

I would actually.
Um, don't listen to Price.

He will never stop
talking to you.

Oh, I thought
you got off my wit, my charm?

Mm. I thought you'd know by now
when a woman was faking it.

Damn.
That's cold.

You know
I love you Price,

like a brother.

Like a much younger,
slower brother

who needs my help
just to tie his shoes.

Okay.
Let the man settle in.

Chief Woodman,
you can bunk up over there.

Where are we headed?

Straight to the river.

How much time
do we even have?

Wait, wait.
He gave me a watch.

Okay, we'll stop and check.

What time you got?

49 minutes left.

No, we need
to pick it up.

No, we need to be smart.

She's gonna kill us.
All right? She's moving slow.

She should
give me the watch.

I have the best chance
to get out there.

No, we have the best chance
if we stick together.

Yeah. For the last time
I'm not giving you this watch.

You think what you want.
I'm making it to the river.

Look, if you don't have
anything good to say

then just shut up.

What's that?

What?

That.

Oh, my--

Careful.

Where are its arms and legs?

What are you doing?

Being of use.

I think
we should keep moving.

Yeah.
What the fuck?

Did you find anything?

No.

No, we should, uh, do like
she says and keep moving.

Come on.

Excuse me.

Woodman's looking
a little weak.

Especially socially.

You wanna
explain that to me

considering he spent so much
time at your research facility?

He did.

But we are talking about
a man who is considered

to have been one
of our deadliest Seals

in the last five years.

So you okay sending him
out there with my men?

Of course.
Colonel, let's be clear.

Nothing we do
will ever fully get these men

and women back
to where they once were.

But we can see to it
that they're useful again.

Useful people is
what makes society tick.

Thanks for the education.

If Woodman
doesn't shoot, you do.

Yes, ma'am.

43 minutes left.
Can we stop for a second?

No.

It's okay.
You just gotta stay positive.

-Thanks.
-You know.

Hey, hey!

Guys, come quick.

What the fuck?
Give it a minute, man.

I thought
we cleaned up all the traps.

We must have
missed one, sir.

It's a waste
is what it is.

Waste of a good resource.

It won't happen again, sir.

It better not.

Be careful guys.

Oh, my God.

What the hell
is that?

Out here, a wolf trap
or something like that?

How bad is it?

How do you know
it's a wolf trap?

Slowly.

What? You've never seen
a wolf trap before?

We don't have time
for this, we gotta go.

Fuck you, Lance.
No seriously. Fuck you.

-How do I get this thing off?
-Usually, that is uncinched.

Let me try.

-Please. It hurts.
-God, it's not moving.

Stop whining.

Either I'm not
strong enough or it's stuck.

Fine. Fine. I'll fucking help
if it gets her out quicker.

Hey.
You got it.

All right, you ready?

One, two, three.

Pull.

It's not moving.

Pull harder motherfucker.

It's not.

Fuck!

Uh, maybe we can
cut it with something.

-Yeah.
-With what?

Uh, let's see. Uh.

The chain goes
all the way around the log

there's no way
we're gonna move it.

Or we could break it
with something somehow.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, a rock or anything sharp.

Oh, my God.
Here, here, here.

Oh, okay, okay, here.

The shit's not working.

Time?

I don't know,
she has the watch.

Can we have it?
Just in case?

Wait.

Okay.

Thirty-eight minutes.

Which just means
we gotta be faster.

No, it means we're
literally running out of time.

We can't sit here
and play MacGyver forever.

Seriously,
what is wrong with you?

Look, we've got
about an hour.

We can still do this.

I would want you to do
the same if it were me.

I'm just being realistic.

Oh, really? So you'd want us to
just leave you here for dead?

Abso-fucking-lutely.

You are a real
piece of work, man.

I'm not dying for
some stranger. I-- I'm sorry.

Oh, but you can kill
one with your car?

Fucking know
what you're talking about.

Stop!

-You don't fucking know.
-Stop.

It's not helping
at all. Okay?

Hey, hey, hey.
What's that?

Look, put pressure
right here.

Quit the shit.

A hunting vehicle.

This shit is not gonna run.

Glove box.
Right?

Maybe there's something
we can use.

Woodman takes
out the band,

it's with our support
and support only.

Stay loose
and have some fun.

All right?

Let's have a go.

Fuck. Fuck.
Where's the fucking gun?

I found something.

-Jesus.
-Fuck!

Sorry.

This is stupid, but--

What?

I didn't do anything
that I wanted to do.

What do you mean?

I just--

I was just
too stupid.

I don't know,
I was selfish.

-Please don't talk like that.
-I'm gonna die here--

Don't talk like that.

I'm so sorry.
I did it all wrong.

Don't be sorry.
Okay. Don't. Don't.

-I did it all wrong.
-I promise you

that we are gonna
get you out of here.

It's okay.

I'm sorry.

Please, no.
Stay awake.

Stay awake.
Rachel, just breathe.

Okay. Just breathe.
We're gonna get outta here.

We're gonna
get outta here.

Yeah. Hey, this looks like
the area we're in right now.

-Right?
-Wait. Hold-- hold on.

We don't even know
if that shit is real.

What are you
talking about?

Well, the map.

I mean, it's a perfect
fucking map placed here for us.

-We don't know.
-Come on.

You can't be serious.
I mean, look at this thing.

Looks like hasn't been
touched in forever.

They probably
forgot about it.

And who gives a fuck?
It's the only thing we got.

Feels like you're
working against us, it's crazy.

Who me? You fuck face!
I'm trying to be smart.

Who knows what
they set up for us?

Holy shit.
Hey, hey. Guys.

Holy shit.
This could be the river.

And this looks like a clearing
not too far from here, right?

Between us
and the river.

Yeah. Yeah.
I-- I say--

I say we go there
and try and find something

to help us
get the hell outta here.

Guys, she passed out.

Shit.

It's not good, guys.

What-- what is that?

Kyle, what--
what time do you have?

30 minutes. It might be
a warning or something.

Yeah, unless
that lead was bullshitting

and they're coming right now.

Either way,
we probably shouldn't stay

in one spot
too long.

What about helping Rachel?

Eagle one,
this is Red Dog one.

Do you copy?

<i>Red Dog, this is Eagle.</i>

<i>We got you loud.</i>

<i>Be advised that designated</i>
<i>call signs are in effect.</i>

Copy Eagle one.

Red Dog, two,
three, four, five,

this is Red Dog one,
mic check.

Three here.

Four here.

-Five here.
-Copy that.

Eagle one, Red Dog one, two
and five will branch off

to the southwest and head
down to the clearing, break.

<i>Red Dog three and four will</i>
<i>team up and head southbound</i>

<i>to flank them</i>
<i>as we flush them out.</i>

<i>Red Dog one out.</i>

<i>Great. Copy.</i>

We already did this. All right?
We obviously have to leave her.

We can't.

If it weren't
for that map and watch,

I wouldn't be standing here.

Her leg is fucked
even if she wakes up.

No, no, no, no.
Okay. Just wait.

For what?
I can get her up.

Okay? Come on, Rachel.
Wake up.

Guys, I hate to say
but we have to go.

No.
Now!

Time?

23 minutes.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You wanna live, right?

-Right?
-Yes.

This is something
we have to do.

There is no choice here.

-Okay, fine.
-Thank you. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
The map is real.

You know,
I don't see anybody.

I can go down there.

Yeah, why don't--
why don't you give me the map?

I'll check out over here.

No, fuck that.
We'll never see you again.

Are you sure?

Yeah. I can go down there
and I'll-- I'll scope it out

and I'll wave
you guys down.

All right,
you better hurry

'cause we only got
13 minutes left.

What's your deal?

You're not
your usual jackass self today.

-What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.

I heard you
talking to Rawlings.

You know that mission
at the ISO prison

with the CIA dude?

The one where one of ours
killed over 200 of theirs?

Yeah, of course.

Well.

Woodman?

-Oh.
-Yeah.

Okay.

All right,
I say we look for anything

we can use
to defend ourselves.

I bet we could find
something that would

-cut that chain on Rachel.
-No, she's dead, Sara!

She's dead!
And we are too if we go back.

Yeah.
We-- weapons. Yeah. Okay.

Uh, uh, I'll check
that big stuff over there.

Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Let's split up.
I'll go with you.

Fine. We'll look over here.

Check around the corner.

That's one
of the most savage things

I've ever heard of.

I know.

So, you afraid that there's
gonna be a bigger swinging

dick around here?

-Ha-ha.
-Mm-hmm.

My dick is just
perfectly average, so fuck you.

I'm just saying.

Well,
I'm saying there's some

pretty fucked up details
said about that mission.

So?
So?

Stupid, my point being
that he wasn't actually

too wounded to be moved.

That woman executed him.

See, that doesn't make
any fucking sense,

because why would you
go through all of that effort

just to kill the guy?

That's what I'm saying.

What if you weren't through
all that just to kill him?

Fuck!

Fuck! Fuck!

I had to. I had to.
I had to. I had to.

Even if it was
for a good reason,

kill your own guy like that,
it had to fuck you up.

He was in pretreatment
longer than us.

Yeah, I know.
Like three months.

What the fuck
were they doing with the guy?

That place is hell.

I don't know, I mean,
look what it did for us.

I've got
almost a year sober now.

-Congrats.
-Thank you.

You're fucking nuts.

Chris. Chris.

Oh, fuck,
he fucking killed me that--

Kyle. Kyle.
Kyle come here.

Please help me.
I can't stand up.

-I can't stand up.
-Kyle!

Kyle and Lance just both left.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Oh God.

Another one?

You're slipping, Colonel.

Show me.

I said show me!

Hey.

Lance!

Lance!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
it wasn't personal, man.

We gotta stop the bleeding.
Okay. Okay.

Oh fuck!

Hey, cutie.

Wait. Wait.
Wait. Hold on.

I just wanna go home.

Hey, don't do this.
Don't do this.

Hey, hey.
I wanna go home.

Let's go back
for Chris and Sara.

No. Do you wanna live?

I wanna live.

Oh, fuck.

We can't have much time left.

You know that motherfucker
took the watch.

Okay.

I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go find anything

that can help you
get outta here.

All right?

I didn't do anything.
Please, please, please.

I didn't do anything.
You can take me away, okay?

Red Dog one
this is Red Dog four.

We got a live one, over.

<i>Copy Red Dog four.</i>

<i>How alive are we talking?</i>

Red one this is Red four.

She's got
a little kick in her left.

Yeah, I wanna go home.

No, I am not leaving you here.
Sara. Sara.

Chris.

What do you think
is gonna happen out there...

realistically?

No, no, no.
I am not leaving you.

Sara.
I'm not, no, Chris.

The best thing
you can do is go.

Lance, don't do that.

Come on man.
Look, this is the river.

You wanna go home?

Shit! They are coming.

Just fucking go.

-Just fucking go.
-I'm sorry.

I dunno how useful she'll be
for the program, over.

I don't wanna die.
Please guys, please.

<i>Woodman is priority one.</i>

<i>Grab that target</i>
<i>move on to rally point Bravo.</i>

Copy that.

-Wait, wait, no, wait.
-Ah?

Please, hey, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

No, please. Please. Please.

Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

-No, no, come on.
-Lively one today.

We're gonna work better
if we put our heads together.

Let's just come up
with a different plan, Lance.

You're crazy.

Please, please. No. No. No!

Whoo!

<i>Remember, if Woodman</i>
<i>doesn't kill, you do.</i>

I found one. I found one.

Shitheels
must have deserted him.

That what happen, boy?

They leave ya?

Fuck.

Someone severed
your Achilles tendon.

That's no fun.

It's your show,
what do you wanna do?

Hey, Junior,
can you give us a moment?

You okay?

<i>Blue Jay one, sitrep, over.</i>

I just need
a private moment with him.

Please, please, please.

Attaboy.

Please, don't.
Please, don't. Please, don't.

Please, please.
You don't have to do it.

Please let me go.
Please, please.

Don't. Stop.

Yes.

Please.

Stop!

Excellent.

Good work, soldier.

<i>Red one, it's Red three.</i>

<i>It's done, over.</i>

Copy that.

Come on.

We'll push him back down
towards Price and Lipson.

There you can
continue your work.

Sara. Sara.

Get off me.
What the hell? Get off me.

-Get off me.
-Stop!

-I'm saving you right now.
-Get off me!

Why did you leave?

Why didn't you come back?
Did you know that Chris died?

Why?

-Why?
-I came down here

because Lance
took the map, okay?

I was not leaving you.
I was coming back for you.

And when I got down here,
I saw that.

Oh, my God.

-What happened to his--
-I don't know.

My best guess
is that that charge

detonated as soon
as he crossed the river.

Must be
some sort of fail-safe.

They were
never gonna let us outta here.

At least
not across the river.

So, what now?

We stick together
and we survive.

All right.

Remember, we're here
to support Woodman.

So let's try to make
the best of what we have left.

Lipson, we're gonna need
your pathfinder skills.

Try and track 'em
along the river,

see if they diverted somewhere,
take Woodman.

Price and I will
head to the high ground

try to flush 'em
down to you.

Junior, go with Lipson.

All right,
let's move out.

You sure we can fix
what's wrong with this guy?

What did I tell you?
Don't worry about Woodman.

Keep your head in the game.

Hey, how long do you think
until we get to that mountain?

I don't know,
about two trail miles

before we clear the forest
and hit some foothills.

Meaning?

Sorry, uh, three more miles
till we reach higher ground.

Do you think we could
get to the other side of it?

Maybe there's
a town or something.

I don't know.
But we gotta try, right?

Right.

Come on.

Is all that shit
they said you did true?

Depends what was said.

Bet it was hard
to kill one of your own guys.

Yeah,
I could do it if I had to.

You weren't there.

Don't believe
everything you hear.

-What happened?
-That's enough.

Have some fucking respect.

The trail's fresh here,
so we're about to engage.

-There she is.
-Stop it.

It's Woodman's shot.

Practicing my aim.

That's a mess.

I prefer
close quarters anyways.

Fuck this!

He's killing his own people.

Motherfucker has gone crazy.

Move.

Somebody want to tell me
what the holy fuck

is going on around here?

Woodman is
going after everyone, sir.

My program.

Damn it!

Come in, Woodman, over.

He's removed
his tracking device, sir.

Obviously.

<i>Woodman, come in, over.</i>

<i>Come in, Woodman, over.</i>

<i>Woodman.</i>
<i>Come in, Woodman, over.</i>

The fuck was that?

-What?
-I don't know.

I don't know.

He's just--
he-- he just-- I got back--

I gotta get outta here.
You don't understand.

Look, look, look, I know--

I know it's a lot to take in,
but we gotta stay calm.

He's going after everybody.
I-- I-- gotta get outta here.

I gotta-- I gotta get back.
You don't understand.

-Like, you don't understand.
-I know.

Kyle, you just gotta--
you gotta breathe.

Just stop.
Breathe, breathe, okay?

Okay. Okay, okay.

Okay? Okay?

Yeah. Fuck!

Okay.

I don't recognize
any of this.

I don't know where we are.

I don't know.
Lance had the map.

We should go back to the place
they were holding us in.

You want to go back
to those psychopaths?

Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, it's the only thing
I can think of.

If they
brought us in that way,

then I bet
we can go out that way.

That actually
fucking makes sense.

And we just gotta
figure out how to get there.

Oh, God.

You lying down on duty, boy?

You answer
when I talk to you.

God!

You're a mess son.

Look at these
zips are undone.

At ease, son.

Hey, man.

Stop! Top, Top.

Jason! Jason!

It's me.

You with me?

Are you with me?

Let's go.

Whose radio was that?

Price.

Is he still on?
Yes, sir.

Why isn't he saying anything?

Oh, God.

Price.
Price come in, over.

<i>Price.</i>
<i>Come in, Price.</i>

Sir, Junior
and Lipson are dead.

<i>It's Woodman. He's gone rogue.</i>

<i>Fall back to command.</i>

We'll find him.

<i>Negative. Negative.</i>

<i>Fall back to command</i>
<i>and wait for QRF.</i>

I'm sorry sir,
but fuck that.

We got it covered.
We want this one, over and out.

<i>Negative.</i>

<i>Rawlings respond. Rawlings,</i>
<i>the program is at stake.</i>

I say we split up and we
flush this motherfucker out.

Yeah.

We need to get them
outta there right now.

No, they stay.

What did you
just say to me?

Those are my men out there.

My program, my data.
They stay.

They know
what they signed up for.

You think because some
politician owes you a favor

that you know
what's coming our direction?

Because you don't.
You need to think again.

Colonel...

If the military wasn't
such a little boys' club,

I doubt you would've ever been
let in in the first place.

So, get back to work.

I don't know where we are.

I don't know
how I got so turned around.

This is not working.

It's okay.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

-We'll get there.
-This is hopeless, Sara.

Do you understand that?

He is gonna
find us and kill us.

No, no, no, no. Stop, okay?
This is not hopeless.

I didn't come this far to just
give up right now, okay?

I am getting back to my son.

You have a son?

Woodman is still in the area,
sir, he's moving.

-Get Zimieski in here.
-Zimieski, back to base.

One. You go that way.

I go the other way.

No!

-No!
-Thank you.

This won't erase
what you did.

Eyes on Gravedigger.

Stop. Stop.
I'm not going anywhere.

It's time
to get you home, cowboy.

-Let's do this.
-Stop!

I am set to blow.

You need to
get your boys outta here.

I'm not leaving you.

Listen, you fucking moron.

If you try to move me,
you and your boys are dead.

Look, we don't have time.

I need you to finish me.

I'm not doing that.

I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you I am fucked.

They've cut me in places.

I can't even feel my legs.

I need you to finish me.

They don't win. I win.

Are you a killer? Huh?

Then do your goddamn job.

No, we're not out yet.

Look at me.

It's okay.

That's it.

That's my boy.

Thank you, son. Thank you.

Sir,
inclement weather approaching.

Possible rainfall.

Rawlings, fall back, over.

<i>Fall back.</i>
<i>Rawlings, fall back, over.</i>

What the fuck is wrong
with Rawlings' equipment?

It seems fine. It's stationary.
It must have come off.

Fuck!

Fuck you. Fuck AMACORP.

You and your psycho
babble bullshit.

The program was just mine
before you showed up.

We could have saved
so many lives.

This blood is on your hands,
not mine.

Abort the mission.
No.

Stay on task.

Did I stutter?

Abort the goddamn mission.

Hey!

We have not finished yet.

You're out.

I know.

Yeah, me too.

You bitch!

You shot me.

You're a coward.

If you're gonna shoot a man...

you shoot him face to face.

Like I said,
we're not finished yet.

He was my son.

<i>Clear everything.</i>

<i>Clear it all. You, with me?</i>

Hurry up.

How much time?

It's almost done, ma'am.

QRF in 45 mikes.

What is it?

Sara?

You-- you left me again.

I'm sorry, I freaked out.

I thought they got you.
But you made it. You're here.

Get away from me.
Get away from me.

No, no, no, no.
We need each other.

Woodman is still out there.

Who are you talking about?
The guy.

The guy who was
killing everybody.

I heard somebody say his name
when he was in here earlier.

Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

I am a coward. A piece of shit.

There is no denying that.
We need to get out of here.

Whoa!

Look, I can explain.
I can explain.

Explain what?

I was just
doing my duty, all right?

I was ordered.

You don't understand.
It's a program to help vets.

It is a good thing.

You were with them...

the whole time?

I was just doing my job.

Sara, look at me.

Look at me, Sara.

Sara, look at me. Look.

No.

Don't do it, please.
Don't do it, please.

My job is
to be the fail-safe.

Make sure you stay
on the hunting grounds.

Make sure these veterans
get the help that they need.

Please don't do this.
Please.

The program helps.

Why couldn't you just
die like the rest of them?

Sara.

Sara, come on.

Sara, Sara, Sara.

Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're fine.

You're fine. It's okay.

Chris, I heard you dying.

-I know.
-No, no, no.

I heard you dying.
I know. I know.

What happened?

He saved my life.

Who?

Him.

-Woodman.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

He's the only reason
why I'm still alive.

No, no, your face.

He's not a good man.

He had to make it
look real or else

he would've
had to really kill me.

I don't believe you.

That piece of shit,
he hunted us.

He hunted us.

He had to make it
seem that way.

He's here to shut
down the program, okay?

What?
Yeah.

What?

Okay, what is this
program exactly?

This program is meant
to get us back to killing.

Plain and simple.

Military can't lose
their investments.

So then,
why did you help us?

I did something
I could never take back.

You remind me of her.

<i>I must</i>
<i>congratulate you, Marcus.</i>

<i>You are far more dangerous</i>
<i>than even I expected.</i>

You know, one thing
I learned many years ago

is there are no accidents.

It was no accident
that you were selected

for that mission
all those years ago.

<i>It was no accident</i>
<i>that my colleague was tortured</i>

<i>so close to death.</i>

And it was no accident

that you were forced
to make an impossible decision.

<i>I suppose</i>
<i>you saved us all in the end.</i>

It's okay.

<i>You see, I never</i>
<i>wanted to cure PTSD.</i>

I wanted to harness it,
turn it into a weapon.

<i>That old man</i>
<i>tried to stop my program.</i>

He had to go.

And I saw an opportunity.

<i>Marcus,</i>
<i>I have been in your head</i>

since before
you even you knew my name.

Breaking you down.

Mind if hang out over here?

Clearing the field.

You were the key to the true
Stalking Fields Program.

The one I designed.

And now, thanks to you,
I have everything I need

to show those bureaucrats
how effective it is.

<i>Give a man a purpose he'll</i>
<i>turn into a ferocious dog.</i>

<i>just like I gave you when--</i>

<i>when I killed</i>
<i>your wife and child.</i>

<i>Claver said they died slowly.</i>

Car trouble?

I'll drive next time.

<i>You see,</i>
<i>there are no accidents.</i>

<i>Your rage</i>
<i>gave me my life's work.</i>

<i>And in exchange</i>
<i>I give you your life.</i>

<i>You just</i>
<i>remember that, Marcus.</i>

<i>if you ever get the itch</i>

<i>to come back</i>
<i>to the stalking fields.</i>

I'm so sorry.

<i>QRF on site.</i>

Come on. Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey man.

Come on.
Hey man. Snap out of it.

Look, I know you're hurt,

but we can't do anything
if you're dead.

We-- we need your help
to get out of this.

Come on.

Marcus. Marcus.

<i>QRF on site.</i>

<i>QRF on site.</i>

You got this.

You got this.

You need to go.
