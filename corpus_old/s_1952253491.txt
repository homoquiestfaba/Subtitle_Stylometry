Five minutes, my little lambs.

Has anyone seen Bliss Cavendar?

Pash, this can't be happening.

Why aren't you backstage, Brooke?

You know how it is.

They get to a certain age,
they don't want you back there.

She said she'll meet me here.

Really? That's odd.
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

PASH:It says "temporary. "

lt did a minute ago, I swear.

My mom is gonna kill me.


(PIANO PLAYING)

EMCEE: Now, Miss Amber Black.

If I could have dinner with
anyone, it would have to be God.

Because what they say
is true. God is great.


Don't tell them that I did it, okay?

Those are the rules,
you're not allowed to tell.


Let go. I'm your only friend.

Corbi Booth, ladies and gentlemen.

If I could have dinner with anyone,
it would have to be my grandfather.

l love you, Papa.


And now, also from Bodeen,
Miss Bliss Cavendar.

(PIANO PLAYING)

(PIANO STOPS)

If I could have dinner with anyone,

it would be Amelia Earhart,

because not only was she
a pioneer of aviation,

but she was a great woman in history.

Thank you.

(PIANO PLAYING)

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

So enlighten me. What was
that little stunt all about?

Are you trying to sabotage your chances?

Or was it just your biological urge to
make your mother look like a jackass?

lt was just a dare.

Oh. How did that work out for you?

Not so great?


Congratulations, honey. Well-deserved.

Thank you. Thumbs way up.

Thank you, Mrs. Cavendar.

Bliss is so hard to beat. Usually.

Well, the Blue Bonnet pageant
is right around the corner.

And we'll be there. Come on, honey.

Oh. See you later. See you.

I'm sorry that these pageants

don't live up to your high
moral standards, Bliss,

but there's a lot you
can learn from them,

no matter what you go on to be in life.

You think you're being
judged up there on that stage,

but no one's asking
you to be Miss America.

I wanna be Miss America.

And you're gonna be the
best one ever, sweetheart.

Teeth.

Eyes.

Trudy, bless your
heart for fitting us in.

Well, hell. Shit happens.

Let me get my foils.

BROOKE: Now, what were you
thinking, getting blue hair?

ANNOUNCER ON RADIO.. Fourteenth
drive in the red zone.

They have now given up nine touchdowns

and three field goals. We'll
see how this one ends up.

He's only had one
takeaway in the red zone.

Hey.


I won another one.

Lord, child, you are unstoppable.

And had I known what you were up
to, I would have bought a ticket.

BROOKE: Earl.

I mean, dang it, girl,
what has gotten into you?

Just defective, I guess.

BROOKE: Nice parenting, Earl.

Come on, now.

Ooh, I'll see you later.


WOMAN: Dinner.

Seriously, out of all the
places to go to in the world.

who would come to Bodeen?

PASH: Them. I mean, they're smart,

at least they just pass through.

BIRDMAN: Go ahead and mock it.

But without the Blue Bonnet
factory, this town wouldn't exist.

You know what, Birdman,

I think I preferred you
before you got promoted.

You know, now you're all corporate.

l know. I miss the old Birdman. Yeah.

Ladies, don't let the tie
fool you. I'm still one of us.

But y'all are gonna have to
start calling me Dwayne now.

It's more dignified. No.

Birdman is the only thing
you have going for you.

(TRUCK APPROACHING)
That's what you think.

BLISS: Really?

PASH: Yeah.

PASH: Hey.

Make sure they tip you this time.

Hey, what can I get you guys?

Hey, Corbi.

So what are you, like, alternative now?

Alternative to what?

What's the name of that thing that
if I eat it real fast, it's free?

That's the Squealer. You have to
eat it in three minutes or less.

Yeah, you bring me a Squealer.

And I don't mean Corbi.



BOY: Let's go, buddy, pick
it up. Come on, come on.

Oh, yes. You got it, you got it.

PASH: I can't believe you
used to share a bed with her.

Baby, baby, get it, yeah.

You make it sound very
dirty. lt was just sleepovers.

Come on. Come on. Baby, do it. Do it.

Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

Come on. Come on, Colby! Yeah.

That's my man. Come on, Colby.

(ALL CHEERING)


It's free, bitches.
It's free. It's free.

l was thinking

maybe we could go to
Austin and do some shopping.

Really?

BOTH: (SINGING WITH RADIO) Teach
them well and let them lead the way

Show them all the beauty
they possess inside

...them a sense of
pride to make it easier

You hate them.

Well, they don't have duct tape
on them. That's an improvement.

Hi.

Thanks.

Ooh!

Pretty vases.

(MALE CLERK LAUGHING)

MALE CLERK: They're
great for tulips, really.

Um...

Thank you. Yup, I changed my mind.

No, please, Bliss. Come on.

Don't... Don't be embarrassed.

It's funny.

I'm supposed to buy you
shoes from a head shop?

Does that really strike you
as responsible parenting?

Fine. 'Cause shoes are a gateway drug.

For gosh sakes, Bliss.

(PHONE RINGING)

ANNOUNCER ON TV.. lt goes out
of bounds near the 42 yard line.

There is a flag down.

Yeah, it's Earl. BROOKE:Hello. Earl.

Can you please explain to your daughter

why it's inappropriate to
buy shoes in a head shop?

Dad, it's not like that.

mother to a head shop?

Are you off your nut?

You know, if she wasn't
here and I used my own money,

it wouldn't make a difference.
That's not the point.

Look, I am in the middle
of a deal here, okay?

So whatever you all
work out is fine with me.

Give me that. Okay?

Earl, do you know how hard I have worked

to raise these girls in
a drug-free environment?

Yes, I do. Exactly.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Hi. Hey, girls. What's up?

Hello. Dropping my flyers off.

Perfect. Hurl Scouts-Holy Rollers.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

See you then. Thanks, girls. Bye.

Come on. All right, let's go. Come on.

BLISS: Screw you and your
grandma's Chevy Celebrity.


Here.

No, what are you doing? Yes,
yes, yes. You got stiffed

on your tips again, just take it. No.

Just take it. take it. No.

What is this? What is this?

Roller derby?

This is... This is tomorrow.

This is in Austin.

Yeah, I know.

Will there be cute boys there?

(BOTH CHATTERING)

Hey, Mom, Dad, we're gonna
go to a football game.

It's an away game, but...

The team kind of needs us.

No, no, no, not "kind of," they do.

EARL: Well, sure.

Hey, I'll tell you what, I'll take you.

No, it's cool. You have your car.

Yeah, I have my car.

No, but I mean, you know,
we can watch together.

Earl, let the girls go
on and have their fun.

And then you and I can nuzzle.

(BOTH GASPING)

I kind of feel bad lying to them.

I don't. I give my parents straight A's.

l get freedom.

Oh, yeah

Don't say I never gave you anything.

Sheena is a punk rocker

(CROWD CHEERING)

Okay, everybody, and welcome
to skate night at the Warehouse.

I'm a little hung-over tonight, so l...

Anyway, let me introduce
you to our first team.

Ooming to you from
the streets of Austin,

men, hold on to your
cookies, it's the Hurl Scouts.

Number 99, captain of the
Hurl Scouts, Maggie Mayhem.

Number 69, Bloody Holly.

Number 3, Rosa Sparks.

Number 2, Smashley Simpson.

Razor Magee's Hurl Scouts have come
in last place three years running.

This league has five teams,
each with their own theme.

What outlaw do we have
skating against the Hurl Scouts

this fine Texas evening here?

I'm talking about the girls so bad
that even God can't keep them in line.

Give it up for the
undefeated Holy Rollers.

Last season's champs
are led by their captain,

the league's leading scorer. Iron Maven.

Yeah, she's the one from the flyer.

I'm feeling hot in these
polyesters right now, baby.

Ladies and gentlemen,

let's play some roller derby.

(BLOWING WHISTLE)

A jammer scores a point in this course

by passing members of the opposite team.

Maven gets a great jump. That's fast.

And she's out to an early lead.

Iron Maven, ladies and gentlemen.

Folks. the ones to watch
tonight are the jammers.

Those are the ones with
the stars on their helmets.

Some of you might remember watching
derby on TV back in the '7 0s,

but it was reborn right
here in the heart of Texas,

a true Austin tradition.

Maven's heading up on the outside
but it's real crowded in there.

hit by Rosa Sparks.

Jackie Daniels is down.

Lucky for the Hurl Scouts
this is only an exhibition bout

because the Rollers are in control.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKER)

(CROWD CHATTERING)

MAN: Thank you, Maggie.

l just wanna tell you all
that you're my new heroes.

It's your first time here?

Yeah.

Well, put some skates
on, be your own hero.


The last time I wore skates,
they had Barbies on them.

Hey, you know, none of us knew our
ass from an elbow pad when we started.

You should come to tryouts on Tuesday.

You have to be 21 . You're 21 , right?

Two:I'm 22.

Yeah, I just had my...
I had my birthday, so...

Great, it's this Tuesday at 5:00.

It is? Yeah.

I'm Maggie, Maggie Mayhem.

I'm Bliss, but I can change that.

Yeah, you'll have to change that.

Don't be late.

"Twenty-two. Just had my birthday."

Twenty-one, it's a red flag.

Twenty-two's way more believable.

l guess, 'cause you're not actually
gonna do it, so I guess it makes sense.

Why don't you and I try out?

Excuse me?

l didn't have a
Barbie-roller-skating phase. Okay?

l had a fat-kid-sits-inside-
and-reads-a-book phase.

You know that.

Well, what makes you
think I won't try out?

(CLEARS THROAT)

be scared to go without me.

And those roller derby
girls, they're tough.

And you are not. Ow!

Gee. How dare you?

Not to mention your mom.

She doesn't have to know.

You don't have the baIls.

l can grow the balls.


No way.

Mm.

Hey.

Do you have room for one more?

l like your hair.

Thanks, hon. I do it myself.

DRIVER: All right, next
stop, downtown Austin.

DERBY PLAYER 1 : Hey.
DERBY PLAYER 2: Hey.

What's your derby name?

Pocket Rocket.

What's yours?

Jaba the Slut.

Hey, you made it. Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm glad you came.

Thanks.

What is that?

That would be Razor. He's our coach.

He's a good guy. And he
really knows his derby.

All right, ladies. Let's roll.

Ooh, jean shorts.

Every single day.

(METAL BANGING)

Meet the Manson sisters.

Gift from the Ottawa Women's
Hockey League to the Hurl Scouts.

They both seem really aggressive.

Maybe we can finally
win a few this year.

Maybe.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

All right, listen up, fresh meat.

There's a lot more to derby than
fishnets and picking out a tough name.

This is a sport.

Now, the league has six spots open.

So whatever shred of talent you have,

hope you leave it out on
the track for me today.

Okay, what is it?

Sorry.

Just what are the rules?

Derby 1 01 , people.

Four blockers from each team
are lined up on the track.

Ten feet behind them,

two jammers are lined
up, one from each team.

We're the ones who score.

First whistle blows
and the pack takes off.

Then a second whistle blows
and the jammers take off.

Some of us faster than others.

Once the jammer breaks through the pack,

she hauls ass around the track
a second time and tries to score.

For every player on the
opposing team the jammer passes,

she gets a point.

Most points wins the
game every single time.

Now, line up and get you some.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

Get up.

Go, ladies. Move it.

Up, up, up. Go.

Looking good, Barbie.

It's roller derby, not cotillion.

Come on, put a hit on somebody.

(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

God damn it. Diane.

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

Hey. That move will get
you tossed from a game.

There's no place in this sport for that.

What?

Okay. Sorry.

But I like the aggression.

Is it bad?

Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm.

No. Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm.

Forty-one, gotta improve
on that. 39, 32, not bad.

Twenty-nine. Let's go.


Twenty-three?

Looks like you've got some competition.

Yeah, yeah, wake me when she
learns how to throw a hit.




Or take one.

Hey, you're Iron Maven.

That's right, kiss-ass.

Why don't you suck up a little harder?

There's still part of your face
that doesn't have doodie on it.

MAVEN: Nice shorts. Bliss: Help.

Can somebody help me? I...

Just kidding.

Hey, by the way, you made
it, you're a Hurl Scout.

Nice work out there.

(CAUGHT UP IN YOU PLAYING)

knew there'd come a day

(CAR HORN HONKING)

When I'd be saying to you

"Don't let this good love slip away..."

Your feet are on fire. They're on fire.

Seriously, look, they're on fire.

You're changing your schedule?

Well, I have to. You know, for practice.

Don't leave me alone with Birdman.

You can change yours to mine.

l can't. I'm actually taking
an SAT class, remember?

(BELL RINGING)

So caught up in you, little girl

That I never did suspect a thing

So caught up in you, little girl

That I never want to get myself free



You caught me Baby, you taught me

How good lt could be

BROOKE: Shania, I am not cleaning Salisbury
steak sauce off of that fringe again.

Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know

that I'm gonna change my work schedule

to Mondays, Wednesdays,

'cause I wanna take an SAT
class on Tuesdays, Thursdays.

I'm impressed.

Me, too.

l like smart girls, that's
why I married your mama.

Well, that and I knocked her up.

So caught up in you, little girl

You're the one that's
got me down on my knees

So caught up in you, little girl

That I never want to get myself free

And, baby, it's true

You're the one

Who caught me Baby, you taught me

How good lt could be

Fill your days and your nights

No need to ever ask me twice

Oh, no

Whenever you want me

Shouldn't... Shouldn't we,
like, be practicing soon?

Yeah, hurry up, you guys,
we don't wanna be late.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Careful, Pee-Wee here might
get the idea we actually win.

You don't? HeIl, no. Never.

All that "We're Number 1 "
corporate crap doesn't apply.

Our bad attitude's an asset here.

Okay, ladies. Check it out.

Hot off the presses, brand new
playbooks compiled by yours truly.

Your hands clean?

Yes, my hands are clean.

Pay particular attention
to Play Number 3.

I think it's gonna blow your doors off.

Smashley, you're late as per usual.

I know.

Well, then you must also know that
there's nothing cool about being late.

Hey... RAZOR: Let's hit the track.

Who's up for Lovejoy's later
tonight? $2 pitchers. Beer?

SMASHLEY: I'm in.

ROSA: Me, too.

I'm in.

You weren't invited.

I'm still in.

There's no such thing as a scrimmage.

We practice the way we play.

Maven, you know what to do.

Bliss, show me something good.

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

You ready? (SCOFFS) Am I ready?

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

RAZOR: Let's go, ladies. Skate.

Don't block your own player, let's go.

Crossover the turn, stay
low. Crossover the turn.

Bend those knees. Bend those
knees. Bend those knees.

BLISS: Ow!

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

What the hell was that?

You had Maven beat, but she smoked you

'cause you're too scared to throw a hit.

And then you quit.

I need you to be a lot more...

l want you to start
being a lot... Ruthless.

Yeah.

That's right, you little peanut,
l need you to be ruthless.

This is a contact sport, Bliss.

Eventually I'm gonna
need you to make contact.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

Next group up. Back off, Razor.

MAGGIE: Just ignore
him. SMASHLEY: We do.

Seriously.

l mean, he's right. I'm not cutting it.

You know what I like to
think about before every game?

My ex.

Little piece of advice, Bliss.

Don't fall for your regional manager

and think that he's
not gonna give you crabs

because he cheated on
you, 'cause it happens.

And when I think about myself in the
shower, using that special shampoo,

which, for the record, doesn't make
anyone feel very special at all,

I really, really wanna hit somebody.

You have to find that thing that
really pisses you off and you use it.

Have you ever had crabs?

No.

No. Okay. My doctor said
it was really common, but...

B-man, come on. What do you say?

Pash has to come. You
know. it's my first game.

Yeah, well, what about me?

I mean, did anybody bother to think,

"Hey, Birdman might appreciate hot
girls in fishnets and roller skates

"beating the crap out of each other"?

No, they did not.

Do you wanna come, too?

Yeah, but I can't. l
have a prior engagement.

I'm covering for Pash.

(EXCLAIMING IN DELIGHT)

Yes. We love you. Birdman.

Yeah? You know we love you.

Thank you. We do. You know that, right?

Yeah, yeah. Not enough.

We're crazy about you.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

You can never have too much eyeliner.

Or LashBlast.

Here's a little gift from the team.

Safety is sexy.

You'll need these, too.
Those are just sexy.

Guys, thanks.

Let the bout come to you.
Let the bout come to you.

Let the bout come to you.

So, are you ready for your big debut?

Has anyone ever thrown
up on the track before?

Yeah.

Let's get them. Kill them dead.

Skate fast, skate hard.

I'm gonna puke.

JOHNNY ON PA: During the day,
they go by Peggy, Francine,

Tammy, and Rachael, but here...

All right, let the bout come to you.

Okay.

ALL: One, two, three, kick ass.

(WHISTLE BLOWS) And they're off.

Jamming for the Widows, Eva
Destruction against the Hurl Scouts.

Bloody Holly who makes
her way out to the pack.

And, oh, she passes the block
with a beautIful backward skating.

But wait a second, from out of nowhere,

Eva Destruction shows
up right on her tail.

Each girl the jammer
passes, they get a point.

Pass a girl, get a point.

And she's gotten the first
seven points of the game.

(BUZZER SOUNDS)

And the Widows take the lead.

Hey, Black Widows, my
spidey senses are tingling.

About to make a sequel in my pants.

Yeah, Spider-Man 3 and a Half?

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Yeah, it is three and
a half inches wide.

(IMITATING TROMBONE)

Air trombone, yeah.

Nice jam, man.

That was amazing.

Thanks.

Yeah. Thank you.

Where did you learn to skate like that?

Well, I once tried out for the Olympics,

but that didn't exactly work out.

You gotta maintain the
triangle configuration.

I've been over it and
over it with you guys.

What do you want to do? Come on.

l don't need to do the triangle.
I need to get up there and...

JOHNNY: It's the second quarter
and we have Manson Number 1

jamming for the Hurl Scouts.

This is a rough contact sport.

These girls are lean,
mean skating machines.

And they gotta go fast if they
wanna get past the blockers

who are trying to knock them down.

And by "knock them down, " l
mean "beat them to a pulp. "

Eva's gonna grab another four points,

bringing the Widows' score to
26 over the Hurl Scouts' 10.

Team captain Maggie Mayhem doing the
honors for the Hurl Scouts, but...Oh!

Getting Widows jammer Honey
Suckit back for that rail check

and Whiskey sweeps Manson
Number 2 out of the way,

making room for Honey to widen the gap

to collect another three points
there as we go into halftime.

That makes the score 29-10. Come on.

(HORN SOUNDING)

They say the Scouts
have the most loyal fans,

and being the worst team in the
league, Lord knows they need them.

Oh, Rosa Sparks, no, you didn't.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

God damn it.

JOHNNY:Okay, folks, the Widows
have a pretty comfortable lead here

late in the game.

Hurl Scouts coach Razor

still sticking with Smashley
Simpson as the jammer.

She's up against the Widows'
speed woman, Honey Suckit.

Oh! The Widows'jammer
hip-checks Smashley.

Well, our favorite
Whole Foods checkout girl

is about to bag her some Honey. Hey.

(ALL CHEERING)

Clean-up on Aisle 5.

With time left for only one more
jam, and the game out of reach,

Smashley Simpson is out of here.

Okay, you're in.

Show me why they call you Ruthless.


Go get you some.

Okay, Austin, get ready to
meet your newest Hurl Scout.

Here she is, Number 22, the fastest
thing on eight wheels, Babe Ruthless.

Babe Ruthless? All
right. Go, Babe Ruthless.

it's the final jam of the night.

I like the taste of fresh meat.

And Razor, with nothing
to lose, throws the rookie

into the last jam on
her very first game.

And dang.

Babe Ruthless gets a double shove
to the rail served up by Whiskey.

But she's back up like a Weeble.

Okay, okay, that's good.

She darts down the inside
and heads towards the outside

and makes a run for it out of the pack.

Oh, but here comes Eva
Destruction, still skating strong,

hoping to ruin Babe's debut.

Ruthless is out of the pack.
She's coming around for her points.


That's my best friend.
That's my best friend.

Rumor has it that Ruthless blew
away the judges in speed trials,

and you could certainly see why tonight.

And now Manson Number 1 takes out Eva.

Feeling the heat Ruthless is bringing,

and she gets through for the score.

(BUZZER SOUNDING)

And Ruthless gets four points.

PASH: Go, Babe Ruthless.

Babe Ruthless scored the
last four points of the game,

but the Widows take this one home.

Congratulations, you still suck.

(ALL WHOOPING)

That's great. Celebrate
mediocrity. That's fantastic.

Yeah, it's all a big joke.

We came second.

We came second. You came second.

We came in second out
of two teams. Nice.

ALL: (CHANTING) We're
Number 2. We're Number 2.

We're Number 2. We're Number 2.

We're Number 2. ROSA:
Razor, come on. You did good.

Well, I didn't throw up.

That'll do. Good thing.

Hey. Hey.

Oh, my God. I take back what l
said about you not being tough.

You kicked ass. Really?

Oh, yeah. And I saw that
guy you liked. You did?

Mmm-hmm. But then I lost him.

Bliss. Hey, Hot Tubs.

Oh, I can't. I gotta get home to my man.

No. Yes. Great game.

Yeah, man, that was good.

What's Hot Tubs? Yeah?

Oh, well, here at the
Warehouse. . he's Johnny Rocket.

But here he's "Hot Tub" Johnny.

Even though he's not allowed in,
we started calling him "Hot Tub"

until he got us one.

Huh.

All right. Check it out.

No. that's . the thing.

Coke? You swallowed?


Not in this lifetime, Johnny.

Or the next one.

Hey.



What's up, ladies?

ShouId we help him?

Nah. That's her fiancé. He
loves it. SMASHLEY: I love you.

That's my fiancé. Hey.


EVA: You know, there's some stuff
I'm pretty sure I could teach you.


MAN: Y'all check it out.
He's not even in anymore, man.


It's gonna be all right

'Cause you are in my sight

All night, all night

Tonight, tonight, aIl night

Hey, sweet thing, will you please bring

That one thing, it makes my heart sing

Why? 'Cause I need it

SMASHLEY: Hey, man, check this out.

That's not a bruise. That's a bruise.

SMASHLEY: Yeah. you look
pretty good. That's nice, huh?

Pash?

(UNATTAINABLE PLAYING)

Nice choice.

Yeah?

Yeah, and I love this one.

So where you from?


Well, I hail from the bustling
metropolis known as Bodeen, Texas.

Uh, the tiny town,
right? Off of South 84?

That would be the one.

You live alone?

Roommate.

Me, too. Four of them.

Why Bodeen? If you don't mind
me asking. What do you do there?

By day, I work at the Oink Joint.

But by night... MAN: Oliver. Oliver.


One second.

Oliver.

Get your ass down here. You
left Jasper's guitar in your car.

All right, dill weed.

Shut up, douche bag.

Nimrod. Tampon.

Tool.


What are you doing in approximately
five and a half minutes?

No official plans.

Great.

I'll go bring you something.

There she is. All by herself.

Hey. MAVEN: Don't fight it.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Let's get a beer.

Oh, my God.

Okay, you can make out
with him. But that is it.

PASH: Who are you, my mother?

Pash?



Savage and I have been
looking everywhere for you.

Yeah, I bet.

My belly hurts.

There's a storm in there.

lt really does, though.

Come on. Hold on. Hold
on. Let's get this.


It's cool. I swallowed it.

No, come on. Just stick
your fingers in your throat.

No, you stick your
finger down your throat.

Pash. Have you ever thought
about your parents making love?

Your dad's naked body?

What?

His balls jiggling.


Sweaty. No.


That's not fair.

Could you get me a washcloth?

Yeah.

I'm sorry I ruined your kind of date.

But I want dirt.

His name's Oliver. It's a great name.

Yeah, if you like wayfaring
Dickensian orphans.

(BLISS SIGHS)

You're gonna have to roll over.
You smell like a dead goat.


Sorry.


Hey, girl. How was the sleepover?

Fine.

BROOKE: Bliss, are you ready yet?

The Blue Bonnet brunch is in an hour.

Did you forget?

You think you have all
the time in the world,

but there's not many girls who
are both smart and pretty like you.

And I hate to admit it, but the
pretty part doesn't last forever.

You got to make the most of
what you have while you can.

Nobody tells you that.

Mom, you're still really beautiful.

Save your sarcasm for later.

How's your inspiration speech coming?

I'm working on it.
You want me to read it?

Not yet. Later?

(JOLENE PLAYING ON RADIO)


Someone get me out of here, Bodeen

It's depressing in the sticks

I'm aIl over these racist hicks

And I'm jonesing for an Austin fix

Yeah. That's right.

Bodeen, Bodeen, Bodeen, Bodeen



BLISS: Oh, my God, it's him.

What do I do?

Go ask him if he wants a Squealer.

Are you stalking me?

No, ma'am.

l happen to be here in Bodeen on
business craving some barbeque.

And, yeah, I'm stalking you.

Okay.

Can you take a break?


You owe me. I wasn't even
supposed to work today.

l love you.

Is this you?


Technically, it's my brother's
band. But, yes, I am in it.

And I'll be taking that from you now.

Wow. From here it kind of looks like
you're wearing a Stryper T-shirt.

Stryper? Yeah, '80s
Christian heavy metal.

l mean, "In the name
of Jesus, we rock."


Well, I suppose if
it's in His name then.

What's this? What's this three
million five hundred and...

Oh, that's nothing.

You wanna know? I wanna know.

It's a little thing called a high score.

At just the right... Go. Nice shot.

Is this what you do with all the girls?

You take them here to
show off your skills?

Yeah. And it usually works, too.

Oh, yeah?

Maybe we should do something different.

night are big and bright

BOTH: Deep in the heart of Texas

l should probably get to practice.

Shit.

Um...

I think I might have lost my keys.

BLISS: Marco. Polo.

Marco.

Polo.

Marco!

Polo!

Found them.

Cool, I guess we can go now.

Oops.

I'm gonna kill you.

I'm gonna tear you up. I know.

l am going to...

l realize this. I realize this.

(BUZZER SOUNDING)

HOLLY: Holy crap, you guys.
We almost won that one.

ROSA: Yeah, almost.

You know, Razor's play actually worked.

Man, maybe we ought to learn new plays.

What's up, Hurl Scouts?

That was so good out there.

lt was really cute to
see y'all trying so hard.


I hate her.

Bliss. Yeah?

Remember all that stuff I said
about winning not mattering?

Forget it.

l wanna beat that cocky bitch.

Me, too.

(ALL WHOOPING)

WINNING PLAYER: On my team. Yeah!

Look what Corbi did.

With all that combined brain power,

this is the best they
could come up with?

BLISS: They got your freckles.

That they did.



Hey, are you all right?

You can't do that.

She just did.

We deserve better villains.

JOHNNY ON PA.. Just
a few minutes gone by,

but the game Is already
faIling into a familiar pattern,

giving the Fight
Attendants an 1 8-to-6 lead.

Okay, ladies, we're getting
beat, but we got the playbooks.

Time to show these Fight
Attendants a few tricks of our own.

Let's run Play Number 3. Stampede.

Number 3?

Yeah. I think we only got to Number 2.

Like, one and a half.

RAZOR: You didn't learn
a goddamn thing, did you?

What's it gonna take for
you guys to pull it together?

You know what? That's it. Hold this.

Did he just take Number 3?

Come on. That's all I'm
saying. Just skate on through.

Hey, what's up, Razor? Ready to forfeit?

Forfeit my ass. Run this play.

What do I look like? An idiot?

Anyway, I've got my own plays.

Here's $20. You know
how little money I have.

You run the play. You don't
score at least three points,

you got another 20 coming
at the end of the bout.

(HORN SOUNDING)

Just run the play, Jeff.

You all right? Let's skate. Yeah.

Ladies, we've got a
change of plan. What?

Hey, don't let that traitor throw
you. Let's hit him where it hurts.

Did Razor just coach the other
team or did my peyote just kick in?

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

I don't even know what's coming on

'cause I don't know what's
coming around the corner.

Fight Attendants are
about to take on the sky.

Whoa! Holy crap, a 1 80 turn.

Kami Kaze makes her way through the
rubble to score an easy four points.

Fight Attendants, 22, Hurl Scouts, 6.

Is that Play Number 3?

Works pretty well, doesn't it?

You suck.

HOLLY: You turncoat.

Want me to give them Play Number 4 now?

No.

Okay. Take a knee.

Okay. I wanna put what
just happened behind us.

l know I've moved on. We're
gonna run Play Number 2.

Fire and Smashley, you at least
know the first half of that, right?

Yes.

Okay.

Then get out there and get you some.

Hey, Scouts. You mind finishing
your little Family Feud huddle?

Survey says you're wasting our time.

Let's go ape shit.

Yeah.

JOHNNY:Coming out of halftime
and an alternate universe,

Coach Razor puts former figure skater
Bloody Holly in the jammer position,

who launches furiously into the pack.

The team is on their game now,
pushing Bloody to the front.

And she makes it through
Bitch and Cookie Flake

grabbing a total of eight
points for the Hurl Scouts.

Come on, come on.

The Hurl Scouts are catching up
in points for the first time ever.

As this space oddity continues,

Babe Ruthless uses
her speed to fly by...

Oh! Axels of Evil knocks her down.

But she's back up. Here
they come around the turn.

A choreographed move
from the Hurl Scouts.

Has to be from Razor's playbook.

That makes the score 58-58,

a first in the history
of the Hurl Scouts.

l can't believe I'm saying this,
but the Hurl Scouts are tied.

We got a tie game here, folks.

Oh, yeah? Oh, but Smashley goes down.

Really? Bitch. What the...No.

Ooh, watch out, Tammy. No. No.

Here comes Smashley.

Get off me, you psycho.

We've got two girls
brawling on the track.

I don't know whether to break it
up or break out the video camera.

Hell hath no fury like a woman fouled.

That's not legal.

By day, these ladies are your
favorite waitresses, nurses, teachers,

but by night these girls give
the crowd what they came for.

Smashley Simpson is out of
here. We're only moments to go

and the Hurl Scouts have
managed to squeak out in front.

We're at a 70-67. Hurl Scouts.

Okay, grab her wrists,
hold on tight. Go.

Play Number 8. You ready for the whip?

Put your arm out, I'll be there.

JOHNNY: It's the final
seconds of the game.

Manson ramps Cookie Rumble,
and the Hurl Scouts attempt

a classic move in derby. Maggie.

Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

Nothing gives you speed like the whip.


A whip. Ruthless is flying into the pack

while her teammates are doing
a downright professional job

of clearing the way. She picks
up one, two, three, four points.

Break out the merit badges. 7 4-67.

(BUZZER SOUNDS)

The Hurl Scouts have finally won one.

(HORN SOUNDING)

Fight Attendants, this
is your captain speaking.

It's gonna be a long, bumpy ride back
to Loserville. So if you have your...

ALL: ...you win the game. If you
run the plays, you win the game!

How about them Hurl Scouts?
Yeah. How about them Hurl Scouts?

How about them Hurl Scouts?

Touché, ladies. Touché.

We got to run the plays. We
run the plays, we win the game.

MAGGIE: We'll do our
homework. Every time.

There're only 10 of them.
It's not... Not rocket science.

Let's get those Holy Rollers.

BOTH: Yes.

(HIGH TIMES PLAYING)

OLIVER: (SINGING) I
put a bomb in your fire

You say
oh-oh-oh-oh

I put a bomb in your
fire You say oh-oh-oh-oh

Murray. Murray. Murray!

the outcome of people like you

You are a sheep in sheep's
clothing and you know, you know

I am a-coming to get
you You say oh-oh, oh-oh

There is a way to
predict the outcome of...

Please tell me you did not
shove Corbi Booth over a rail.

Actually, I did.

Corbi has a huge bruise on her leg.

I know that you're just
too bohemian to care,

but she has to cheer tonight.
