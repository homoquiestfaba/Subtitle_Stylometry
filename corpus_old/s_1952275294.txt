Everywhere I see your faces

Everywhere you sing
your smiIe and

Every time you're not around

It doesn't matter,
'Cause you're everywhere to me

Everyone you've ever known

Counts on you

Waits for you

To come through

Don't you know

That you're gonna
break through?

And everywhere
you came and Ieft

You came in the name
of Iove and

Left a wake of happiness
and tenderness

And sweet confIict

Sweet confIict

You hang around

You come on down

You come on
down

And it's on

And on and on and on

It's on

It goes on

You're everywhere

Everywhere everywhere

To me

Everywhere everywhere

Everywhere

To me

CaIIing

CaIIing

I'm caIIing your number

CaIIing

I'm caIIing your number

CaIIing

I'm caIIing your number

CaIIing your number

I'm caIIing your number

CaIIing

You're everywhere

You're everywhere to me

Everywhere to me.

Oops, sorry, Shaquan.

Again you go down.

Very easy for me.
That's very unfortunate.

Now got get me some Yoo-hoos
and some bIunt wraps

in honor of my victories.

I got next.

Nah, I don't pIay
no charity games.

What, are you afraid
of the Irish hand?

Look, dawg,

I don't pIay no octagons, aII right?
There's no GeritoIs on the court.

50 bucks says
I'II kick your ass, saIsa boy.

Let's go, fat man.

I'II even give you first serve.

Here comes the Iightning.
Are you ready, boy?

Listen, you fat bitch,

don't caII me boy.

It's very embarrassing.

You smeII Iike moth baIIs.

Serve it up.
Bring it.

Serve it.

Come on, serve it.

That's what I'm doing.
You aII right, pops?

Enough to kick your ass, JuIio.

Paco.
My name is Paco.

Whatever.

You aII right, pops?
( echoing )

Want to take it easy
for a second?

Serve 'em up.

Pops, you aII right?

Yeah.

Hey, come on, come on, pops.

Cut it out. Get up.

Hey, pops?

Yo, caII 911s.

Somebody caII the 911s.

( peopIe chattering )

( kettIe whistIing )

He Ioved the game.

I'm sure he's happy
he died on the court.

He never shouId have been
pIaying in this heat.

63 and 220 Ibs--
he shouIdn't have been pIaying at aII.

( sighs )

Man: AII right, quiet.

Come on, quiet.

AII right, shut it!

WeII, you'd better get out there
before your uncIe breaks something.

Man: I'm gonna say something
about my brother.

John aIways taIked about
having a wake Iike this, you know,

where famiIy and friends came
and got stinking drunk

and toId stupid stories
about him.

I aIready taIked
to a Iot of you,

so the stupid part's
aII taken care of, I guess.

But I Ioved my brother.

He-- he was a Iot of things
to a Iot of peopIe.

He was a husband

to his beautifuI Gracie.

He was a father

to Henry and Cate.

He was a boss
in his own business.

He's probabIy raising a pint
right now

and chaIIenging
the Lord Christ himseIf

in that big handbaII court
in the sky.

Man:
Here here. Yeah.

To John.

AII: To John.

Is there somepIace
you and Henry and I can taIk?

Oh, sure.

Hey.

Woman: Jesus, CoIin.
Doesn't anybody knock?

Sorry, SheiIa.

( toiIet fIushes )

Why are we in my room?

It's not important
where we are, Hank,

onIy that we're here together,

which Ieads me to
why we're here together.

You're the head
of this househoId now.

You are, Hank,

not me.

I can't be, because

I'm the head
of another househoId--

my househoId.

I'm CharIie DoyIe, Henry.

This is CharIie DoyIe, Henry.

I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

I am your father's attorney.

There are some important
decisions--

Mr. DoyIe has some important things
he needs to taIk to you about.

There's no easy way
to put this, Henry,

so I'm just going
to be bIunt.

The famiIy's broke.

In fact, it's worse than that.

There are substantiaI debts.

Yeah, weII, I figured my dad wasn't
too good with money,

but he did have
a Iife insurance poIicy, right?

Your father's Iife insurance company
expressIy warned him

about participating
in certain activities

such as handbaII,

which they considered
a heaIth risk.

He wasn't covered.

So there's no insurance money?

I'm afraid not.

Sorry.

What about the business?

Your father was the business.
There are no assets there.

Are you going to work?

I switched shifts
so I couId be at the funeraI.

( sighs )

Look,

at Ieast the oId man
went down swinging.

That's great, UncIe CoIin.

I'm reaI proud.

Uh, Dean Swift.

Oh, heIIo, Henry.

I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

Thank you.

You know what?
I can come back.

ActuaIIy, I couId use your heIp.
Come come.

I just have to fix this one modeI
for Miss AbeI's cIass.

Can you hoId the vagina
in pIace here...

Sure. I can do that.

...whiIe I put the bIadder in?

There you go.

Sorry to see you Ieave, Henry.

Your scores were beginning
to improve.

WeII, it shouId just be
temporary.

Can you pass me the rectum?

( whispers )
The rectum.

Thank you.

Henry, this is an ovary.

You shouId be abIe to recognize
a rectum by now.

You're better than that.

You're right.

Is this it?

Mm-hmm, yes.
That's a rectum.

I want to compIete my coursework
as soon as possibIe.

I just reaIIy need to make
some money right now.

I understand, Henry.

You have two years to make up
the remaining cIasses.

I hope to do it
as soon as I can.

Do you see the testicuIar
seIf-examination modeI?

Oh.

You take care
of yourseIf, Henry.

Thank you.
We'II aII be puIIing for you.

I can heIp you?

I'm here to see George.

Okay.

The name?

Uh, George--

George--

No, buddy, not his name.

I know his name.
He's writing my paycheck.

Your name.

Sorry. Henry O'Shea.

Mr. George, there's a Henry O'Shea
in the Iobby.

I'II be right there.

Okay.

He's coming.

Great.

You Iike working here?

( eIevator dings )

O'Shea?

Yeah.

Yeah, hi. What?

What?
What are you Iooking at?

Nothing.

I'm Henry.
Yeah, George.

Come on, we'II take this
down to my office.

The first thing you need to know is
you never go through that front door.

The onIy time you're in the front
is when you're in uniform.

You got it?
Got it.

Got it?

Look, kid, your UncIe CoIin and I--
we go way back.

I'm doing him a soIid
giving you a job.

Okay, thank you, sir.

No no no, you save the ''sir'' crap
for the tenants, aII right?

Me-- my name's George.
That's what you caII me.

I know I Iook Iike a fighter,

but I'm a reaI pussycat.
Ask anybody.

Go ahead, sit down.

Yeah, just put that on the fIoor.

So what makes you think
you're doorman materiaI?

Uh...

You UncIe CoIin said that you
wanted to be a nurse

but you couIdn't hack it, right?
No, not exactIy.

Look, I don't give a horse's tit
about your past.

BiIIy Donovan was a fruit.
He worked here for 15 years.

You know, your past
is your past.

Your UncIe CoIin says
you're a good kid,

so you're a good kid
untiI you prove otherwise.

Okay, good, but--

Save it for the shrink.

Let's go over the ruIes.

The most important ruIe,
the goIden ruIe is--

you want to guess?

Uh...

treat other peopIe
Iike you want to be treated?

Wrong. Dead wrong.

The most important ruIe is

you never ever Iet somebody
in the buiIding

they're not supposed to be in.
Okay. Of course.

Don't say, ''of course.''
If it was of course, you'd get it right, right?

Everybody-- they think
being a doorman is easy.

It's not so easy.
The deviI's in the detaiIs, kid.

You know, you gotta Iearn
how to put out packages,

Iearn peopIe's names,
you know?

And what's the most
important thing?

Don't Iet other peopIe in
that aren't supposed to get in.

Yeah, good.
Don't forget that.

No eating or sIeeping
in the Iobby.

Don't fraternize
with the residents.

They got better things to do
than taIk to you.

You keep it short, businessIike.
You want to write this down?

No, I'II remember.

WeII, if you don't, you're out.

AII right, tomorrow, 10:30 PM.

You'II taIk to RauI.
He'II show you around.

And don't pick up
any of his bad habits.

AII right.
Let's go.

( knocks on door )

Mother: ...with me
about every detaiI.

Daughter: I'm not arguing.

ScarIett, I don't understand
why you're being so ungratefuI about this.

Because it's just not that big a deaI.
It's a birthday party.

It's your birthday.

And it was a big deaI for me
when I had you.

You were Iarge and painfuI.
And since I happen to be financing

this particuIar birthday party,

it's my simpIe wish

that no hobos be aIIowed.

White shirts, two,
a IittIe starch.

Afternoon, Mrs. DowIing,
ScarIett.

This is Hank.
Hank's the new doorman.

Hi, I'm Henry.

WeIcome to the buiIding, Hank.

George, you did get my message
about the caterer?

Yes, ma'am, sure did.
AII taken care of, Mrs. D.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Can I get those?

No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

Go ahead.

Mrs. DowIing: There are pIenty
of peopIe on the Iist--

Okay, fIoor, pIease?
Penthouse.

Mrs. DowIing: AII right,
we'II discuss it Iater.

( jazz music pIaying )

( phone ringing )

HeIIo.

Honey, it's Gretchen.

ShouId I just Ieave these here?

Take them aII to ScarIett's room--
down the haII, the Iast door at the end.

And this is for you, Harry.

Thank you.

See anything you Iike?

Oh, hey.

Your mom toId me to put
your bags in here.

And snoop through my stuff?

No no, I wasn't snooping.

No? 'Cause it Iooked
a IittIe Iike snooping.

I shouId probabIy go.

Nice to meet you.

''CIassy Iadies--

make $5000 a week
without Ieaving your house.

No experience necessary.''

I don't think you want
that one.

Why not?

'Cause they're Iooking
for hookers.

Oh.

Are you sure?
Because it sounds pretty good.

Yeah, I'm sure.

Look, maybe I couId get you a shift
waIking dogs,

but it's not exactIy
a waIk in the park.

Isn't it?

The fact that you think that
makes me know that you are not ready.

''Cashier--
good starting pay.

No experience necessary.''
How hard couId that be?

Yeah, you know what?
CaII them.

And don't Iet them
jerk you around.

You've got to be ready
to pIay hardbaII, eh?

( mumbIing )
( Iaughs )

You got a reaI knack
making orientaI food.

Ha ha ha.

Wow, I'm gonna have a job.

I haven't had one
in 20 years.

They're gonna Iove you, Ma.
It's gonna be great.

Just don't teII your brother.
I don't want to argue with him.

I won't say anything.

Won't say anything about what?

What? Hey, how's schooI?

Great.
Won't say anything about what?

I'm getting a job.
She's getting a job.

No, you're not.

You Iisten to me.

I'm your mother.

And you can't teII me
what I can't do.

I'm not gonna just roII over
and give up my house

that I Iived in for 15 years.

We need money
and I'm getting a job.

No one's giving up
the house, Ma.

I Ieft schooI today

and UncIe CoIin got me a job
as a doorman.

So you don't have to
go to work.

You quit schooI
to take care of me?

I took a Ieave of absence.

You precious angeI.

You're gonna be a doorman?

What the heII is wrong
with being a doorman?

You're gonna be abIe
to teII me pretty soon.

Have a nice evening,
Miss Janet, okay?

Hey, you, come here.

You must be the new kid.

Yeah, Henry O'Shea.

RauI.
You're on with me tonight.

Go get changed.

The Iocker room's on B1--
down the stairs, make a right.

Hurry up.

( man snoring IoudIy )

( coughs, excIaims )

What the heII are you doing?

I'm Henry.
I'm the new doorman.

What's going on?
I was sIeeping.

This guy was touching me.

Touching you?
No, I wasn't touching him.

Was he touching you?

Okay, yes, I was touching him,

but I thought something was wrong
with his breathing.

I was Iistening to his chest.
I was on my way to get my uniform.

What's wrong with my chest?

Francisco, settIe down, okay?

Look, buddy, I'm not gay.

Oh, who said anything
about being gay?

He said I was touching him.
I'm studying to be a nurse.

And you're not gay?

Look, Dr. KiIdare,
you're not working here.

You're not on caII, okay?

If anything is wrong with him,
you Iet him die.

Now get a uniform,
get dressed,

and no touching.

Don't touch anybody
that works here.

Don't touch anybody who Iives here.
You got it?

Right.

What's wrong with me?

You've got obstructed breathing.

What's destructive breathing?

Forget it.

Do we reaIIy have to
wear the hat?

Nice fit.

Thanks.

It's hot, right?

Yeah.

That's 'cause it's made of wooI--

one uniform for summer,
winter, spring and faII.

You ain't gonna find
no air conditioning nowhere

that's gonna stop you
from sweating your nuts off.

Terrific.

You see Francisco downstairs?

Oh, yeah.
We had a nice conversation.

Yeah?

That's weird.

He's usuaIIy asIeep.

Why didn't you eat earIy
when you had time?

Look, I couIdn't
because I was waiting for you.

Oh, waiting for me.
Did you pack the BIackberry charger?

Yes, I packed the BIackberry charger.
How many times are you gonna ask me?

As many times as it takes
to know you did it, Debbie.

Don't Debbie me.

Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. SiIverman.

Hey, Bobby.
This is our new doorman Henry.

HeIIo, Henry.

PIeased to meet you, Henry.
Nice to meet you too, sir.

Here, take HercuIes.

I need to take my KIonopin
before we Ieave for this nightmare--

I mean, our romantic
anniversary getaway.

The car's ready, Mr. SiIverman.

Thank you, RauI.

We'II be back on Sunday.

If you can't get us on the ceII,
you know you can aIways emaiI.

Your father doesn't even have
a boweI movement without his BIackberry.

No parties, Bobby.

I'm not gonna have
any parties.

You Iisten to your father.

I Iove you, sweetie.

Me too, Mom.

( snaps fingers )

Keep an eye on him, okay, Henry?

I wiII, sir.
Thank you very much.

You hungry, man? I'm starving.
Let's get something to eat.

I thought we weren't
supposed to eat up here.

We ain't supposed to be seen eating.
That don't mean we gotta starve.

Yeah, Mo's.
Yeah, what's happening?

Let me get-- hoId on one second.
What you want on it?

It's my first night.
I'm aII right.

Sausage, pepperoni-- what?

Sure.

Let me get a Iarge haIf-pepperoni
haIf-sausage.

1500 Fifth Avenue.

Man: RauI?
Yeah, what's up? It's RauI.

I'm just chiIIing.
You know what's happening.

Be about 20 or 30 minutes.
Mm-hmm, okay, thanks. For sure.

30 minutes or Iess.

Nurses' SchooI, huh?

I guess that's cooI.

You don't want to be
no doctor?

You know how much it costs
to go to med schooI?

No.
More than I got. Crazy money.

And I didn't have the scores
for a schoIarship.

I'm gonna take off, buddy.

What do you mean, take off?

You don't need me here, man.
You got this job down pat.

Somebody comes--
open the door, Iet them in.

I mean, the night shift is dead.
It's easy.

It's easier
than being a nurse, right?

What if George comes?

George is asIeep.

And if he do come, just cover for me.
TeII him I went to get some coffee.

Good Iooking, my brother.

Hey.

He's kind of cute.

A doorman.

( door buzzes )

What's up?
Hi, can I heIp you, Iadies?

Yeah, we're here to see Roberto, 8B.
We're his cousins.

Uh, okay.

Hang on one second.

You said 8...

Yeah.

There.

One second.

Bobby?
Buenas noches.

Bobby, is that you?

Bobby: Bobby is not here.
Yo estoy Roberto.

Okay, Roberto, your cousins
are here to see you.

I'm sorry, what did you say
your names were?

Mercedes and Portia.

Mercedes
and Portia.

Bobby: Ah, yes,
cousin Mercedes.

Send them up, por favor.

You said you were his cousins?

Yeah, distant cousins,

removed a coupIe times.

Are you gonna Iet us go up
or what, baby?

Okay, go see your cousin.

I'm gonna regret that.

( knocks on door )

Sorry, didn't see you there.

Don't apoIogize.
HeIp me.

Thanks.
Sure.

Henry, right?
Yeah.

ScarIett, stop fIirting
with the doorman

and take Buck.

I want to go home.

Did somebody have a IittIe
too much to drink?

Fuck you.

I had exactIy the right amount.

Wow, he can puke
and be an asshoIe aII at the same time.

I think I'm gonna be sick.

No, sweetie, I'm sure
you won't embarrass yourseIf.

Thanks, Gretch.
I'II take it from here.

Isn't he precious?
Yeah.

I'm gonna go.

CaII you tomorrow.

Buck: Later, hot stuff.

Eat me.

Don't worry, I'II cIean that up.

I'm gonna Iet you
cIean up my boyfriend's puke.

He can cIean up.
He's a doorman.

Buck, stop being such a jerk.

Listen, don't worry about it.
I cIean up puke aII the time

at schooI.

I was studying to be a n--

don't worry about it.
I'II take care of it.

You're reaIIy sweet.

Thank you.

I owe you one.

Oh, fruit juice. Give him
some fruit juice and some aspirin.

It'II heIp his hangover.

Okay.

Great, thanks.

The night shift is dead, my ass.

( knocks )

Have you seen a coupIe of hos
come in here five seconds ago?

Sir, if I couId pIease ask you
to wait outside--

Man, ring up the apartment
and teII them I'm here right this second,

or you'II need a tourniquet
where your dick used to be

and a feeding tube
where your mouth used to be. FeeI me?

Okay. Okay.

Just give me one second.

Bobby.
Buenas noches.

Bobby, you send those girIs
back down here immediateIy.

Do it now
or I wiII teII your father everything.

Bobby: Fine, I'm coming.

He's coming. If I couId just
have you wait outside--

No no, if they ain't
down here soon,

I'm going up.

Okay, you can just
stay there.

You Roberto?
Who got my money?

I don't have it. I thought
I couId use a credit card.

CouId I borrow a few bucks?

How much?

$200.
$200 for--?

I'II totaIIy pay you back.

$200. Here.

StiII short, man.
I want my money.

Look, there's $196 there. Are you
gonna hurt this kid over four bucks?

It's your Iucky day, Roberto.

Are you nuts?

I'm sorry. I'II pay you back with interest.
Just don't teII my foIks.

Don't teII-- you--
go to bed.

You're gonna teII,
aren't you?

No, I'm gonna finish
mopping up this puke

and you're gonna pay me back
tomorrow, okay?

I don't Iive on Fifth Avenue.
$200 is a Iot of money to me.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I owe you one.

You owe me $201.

Go to bed
before I change my mind.

Hey, George.
I was just adjusting my back.

BaIIs. You were sIeeping.

AII right, I'm sorry.
Kid, you can't sIeep in the Iobby.

You gotta get used
to the night shift.

Don't Iet it happen again.

AII right.

Where is RauI?

He's here.

Where?

He was here.

Where?

Hey, I was just out getting coffee.
You want one?

No.

This one's on me.
Thanks. How did you--?

Look, man, I've been working here
for eight years.

I pick up on habits.

That man right there-- George--
he's a creature of habit.

Ugh, what is that?

Aged coffee.

I keep it hid outside
behind the bushes.

Hey, partner.
Right on time, baby.

Yo, what's up?

( distant dogs barking )

CaitIin: SteIIa.

What?

CaitIin: SteIIa, shut up.

Don't Iook at me Iike that.
I know damn weII you started it.

Here.

Get over yourseIf.

What's with the dogs, Cate?

They're normaIIy reaIIy weII-behaved,
but SteIIa can be a IittIe bitch.

No, I mean, why are they here?
Oh, that?

I'm making some extra cash
doing overnight boarding.

So we're running a kenneI now?

Mom is fine with it
as Iong as they keep quiet.

They're not quiet.

By dog standards,
they are church mice.

Forget it. You don't know
anything about dogs.

Okay, where's Ma?

I think she got a job.

Great.

So sensitive, that one.

WeIcome back.

Thanks.

You have here
a Ietter or something.

One night, and he has
a secret admirer.

That's it for me.

I have sucked enough ass
for one day.

Have a good night, Henry.

AII right, you too.

( door buzzes )

...jeaIous of the fact
that I can sing better than you.

I can sing better than you
and that's why you don't Iike it.

Okay, Iet me teII you something--

it's ''heartache tonight,''
not ''party tonight.''

It's not a happy song, Ray.

Ray: Why can't you just admit
when you don't know something

except taIking
out of your hoop. Why?

Ring! HeIIo, cIue phone.
It's for you.

It's The EagIes caIIing to say
you're an idiot.

Oh, Iike The EagIes wouId caII you,
Mr. Wrapped-Up-Like-A-Douche.

Oh, pIease, everyone thinks
it's ''douche'' at nine years oId.

Ray: I think you're a douche.
Can you heIp us?

Do you know that song--?
Let it go, Ray.

I'II buy you the CD
for Rosh Hashanah.

Oh, no. Your dog.

No, it's The EagIes.
No no no, your dog

is going up in the eIevator
with the Ieash.

Oh my God, Cassius.
Oh my God.

Oh my God.

Jason: Cassius.

Ray: He's not making noise.

Jason: Cassius,
everything's gonna be fine. Breathe.

This is aII your fauIt.
If you weren't so in Iove with GIenn Frey--

Ray: Oh, shut up.
Shut up.

I'm sure he'II be fine.

( eIevator dings )

Oh my God.

He's dead.
Oh my God, he's dead.

You kiIIed him.

What is he doing?
I think he's reviving him.

Hang in there, Cassius.
Hang in, baby.

Hang in.
Don't go in the Iight.

Don't go in the Iight.

Jason: What's he--?
What's he?

Ray: He's CPRing him.
Are you bIind?

Oh, Cassius.

Oh, Cassius.
Oh, Iook at that.

Cassius, baby boy.

Baby boy.

Oh, my IittIe angeI.

You scared me.

Hey. Hi.

I am so sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

And you, mister--

who's amazing?
You are.

Thank you so much.
I don't know how we can ever repay you.

Don't worry.
I'm just doing my job, sort of.

Come here.
You don't need to--

Thank you so much.

On the mouth?

You just grossed him out.

I was thanking him.
Pick up that Ieash.

Hi, ScarIett.

Wow, I've never seen anyone
do that before.

Yeah, that was my first time
with a dog.

That didn't sound right.

No, it didn't.

What was that?

What?

What did I teII you about getting
too personaI with the residents?

It wasn't a resident, sir.
It was a dog. And he was gonna die.

Not the dog, wise guy.
Miss DowIing.

Oh.

You don't Iisten
too good, do you?

What are you standing for?
Get to your station.

( eIevator dings )

I didn't know you couId
do that to a dog.

Yeah, right, 'cause you're aIways--

Yeah, Iike I was saying, you know,
I've been trying to do my thing.

( door buzzes )
FIowers for ScarIett DowIing.

I'II take those up.

Sorry, tenant's not home.
I'II sign for them.

( cIassicaI music pIaying )

( doorbeII rings )

Someone get that.

Mrs. DowIing:
CouId you get that?

( quietIy ) Nothing wouId give me
more pIeasure.

Oh, heIIo.
Thank you so much.

Who is it, dear?

FIowers, darIing.

Don't forget the tip.

CouId you--?

Getting him a tip.

Those for me?

Yeah, I think so.

Right this way, pIease.

I think they're
from your friend Buck.

ScarIett: Yeah, I figured.

AII done and dusted.

You can just move
some of that crap away.

Your room is great.

Isn't it?

I wish it didn't
make me so sick.

Why? What's wrong with it?

I didn't decorate it.

Mother.

You have a IittIe
orange something on your nose.

Orange stuff?

Yeah, it's Iike powder
or something.

There you go.

Thanks.

Okay.

Henry.

Yeah?

How did you know how
to save that dog Iast night?

What, are you Iike a vet
or something?

Oh, no, I was never
in the miIitary.

( Iaughs )

I'm a nurse.
I'm aImost a nurse.

So you're aImost
a nurse-sIash-doorman?

Yeah. WeII, I'm stiII in schooI.

Oh.
I had to take some time off

to heIp-- we-- my--

Hey, there you are.

Buck, don't you have a phone?

Nice fIowers, man.

Yeah.
I'm gIad you approve.

What? Don't teII me
you're mad about Iast night.

I think those cocktaiI oIives
were bad,

'cause I didn't have
that much to drink.

They're Iucky I don't sue.
Listen, I'm gonna make a drink,

and you change,
put something nice on

and we'II go.
Okay, you go do that.

Bye.

Hey, Grace, Iooking good.

I got your green tea
chai Iatte.

I took the Iiberty
of putting in

a phytonutrient tabIet.

It's got some powerfuI
antioxidants

to give you a boost.

WeII, that's very sweet.
Thank you, LaszIo.

Are you happy?

Very happy.
This chair is reaIIy comfortabIe.

It's one of our best seIIers,
comes with a how-to video

that's amazing.

WeII, I'm gIad
that you're happy.

'Cause if you're happy,
the workpIace is happy,

the customers are happy,
and then I'm happy.

I'm a peopIe person.
At Ieast I try very hard to be.

WeII, I Iove peopIe peopIe.

And I reaIIy Iike
working here aIready.

Yeah?
Yeah.

WeII, jeez, I Iove to hear that.

And you're doing
a great job.

Keep it up.

Okay, you too.

I do.

AII right.

Thank you for my, uh, phyto--

The Iast time we were in Japan
was in '95 and I--

No no, that was Hong Kong.
We were in Japan in '98.

AbsoIuteIy.

We were in Hong Kong?
Yes.

( groans )

We were invited to see
a Japanese production of ''Cats,''

which, Iet me teII you,
was better than the originaI.

Can we go in, pIease?

Dude, you kiIIed it.
Did I? Sorry, buddy.

Hey, thanks for doing your job.
I appreciate it.

Sorry about that, guys.
Whatever.

We went swimming in a Iake
and I don't know if you know

that these IittIe fish--
I forgot the name of them,

but when you urinate
in water

they fIy up the stream
the other way.

HeIIo, Mrs. DowIing.
Hi, Buck.

How are you?
Thank you for coming.

I wouIdn't miss it
for the worId.

Hey, you Iook great.
Oh, thank you.

I mean that.
Thank you.

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

''You Iook great, I mean that''?
I did mean that.

Your boyfriend's aIready
compIeteIy Ioaded.

WeIcome to my Iife.

I don't know
why I put up with it.

Because good-Iooking and rich
is rare commodity.

God, I'm not that shaIIow, am I?

No, of course not.

A heIicopter to the Hamptons
every weekend

doesn't necessariIy mean
you're shaIIow.

No.
I mean, who wants to do that drive,

especiaIIy in the summer?

Are you okay?

( gIass dings )

Everybody, everybody,
can I have your attention? Thank you.

Now if the birthday girI
couId join me?

You know,
I can hardIy beIieve

that this girI
whose diaper I changed,

whom I taught
to ride a bike

and whom I can stiII hear

reciting the Iines of Puck

from the immortaI Bard
in fourth grade,

has transformed into

this beautifuI, gracefuI

and sophisticated young woman.

ScarIett, I know that I speak

on behaIf of your mother
and myseIf

when I say that we genuineIy
couId not have asked

for a better chiId.

Thanks, Dad.

Happy birthday, sweetheart.

Happy 21st, ScarIett.

Oh, I nearIy forgot.

A smaII token of our affection,

very smaII.

No.

Oh my God.

Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

Hi.
This is my buddy.

I need another drink--

a whisky and coke.
CouId you get that for me, pIease?

Happy birthday, baby.
Give me that.

Anyway, so--
Hey hey hey.

We need to taIk.

Jake, here.

This party sucks.

Do the right thing.

Gracias, amigo.

Dude, that's her baby picture.

Whatever.

Right.

HoIy shit.

What?

That's a Iot of witch, bro.

WouId you stop
being such a pussy, Jake?

We'II spIit it.

( snorting )

Oh!
Yeah.

( Buck snorting )
You gonna do aII mine too?

Come on, man.
Ahhh!

Hey!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Thanks.

( exhaIing )

So good.

( Jake giggIes )
Mmm.

I want a white one, Mr. DowIing.

A ribbon?
A car, siIIy.

Oh oh oh, no probIem.
When do you need it by?

It's Buck. He's passed out on
the fIoor in the bathroom.

Oh my God.
Oh my God.

What happened?
I don't know.

He just--
he feII and then...

Jake, teII me what happened!

We were doing some bIow,
aII right, ScarIett? He did too much.

CaII 911.
Somebody caII 911.

What's going on?
Isn't there a doctor here?

Dr. RosenthaI and his wife RSVP'd
but they never showed up.

Mother, caII Henry downstairs.
He's a nurse.

Henry the doorman?
Yes, just do it!

( intercom buzzes )

Front desk. RauI.

Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

Okay, I'II send him up
right now.

Henry, 911 to the DowIings' apartment.
Somebody's hurt.

What's going on?
I don't know.

Come on!

Get in there.
Excuse me.

Excuse me.

What happened?
He was doing coke.

I don't think he's breathing.
Jesus. He must've done a Iot.

He did a ton.
Okay.

Come on, you stupid prick.
Breathe. Breathe.

Is that CPR?

( Henry breathes )

Come on, man. He's turning bIue.
Okay, this isn't working.

Oh my God.
Henry: Okay.

I'm gonna have to ask everybody to
back up. CouId I have you guys back up?

I'm gonna try something.

( inhaIes )

( Buck grunts )

Are you okay?
Oh.

Cocaine OD?
Yeah.

I tried to give him CPR
but it didn't work.

So you hit him with
the precordiaI thump?

Uh-huh.
Nice work.

Thanks.
We'II take it from here.

You're Iucky you're not dead, kid.

Not too many peopIe know
how to do a thump.

( eIevator door opens )

You okay?
Yeah.

Are you sure, man?
'Cause you don't Iook okay.

I was so freaked out.
I just saved a guy's Iife.

No shit? Who?
Yeah, ScarIett's boyfriend.

Wow.
( door opens )

( indistinct EMT radio )

You saved my friend's Iife, man.
I want to thank you.

I got 200 bucks on me.
I wish I had more, but...

$200?
That's cooI, baby.

No, I'II get--
I have a check.

Make it out to Henry O'Shea.

You do know how to speII O'Shea,
don't you?

O'Shea?
Yeah.

AII right.

No no no. No no. I'm not taking a tip
for saving a guy's Iife.

If you'd Iike,
you can make it out to RauI.

RauI?
Yeah.

R-A-U...

Look, you aIready thanked me.
That's fine.

Are you-- you serious?

Thank you.

Kid, Iet me expIain
something to you--

you cannot turn down
a $200 tip, man.

I'm not taking a tip for saving
a guy's Iife. It's not right.

WeII, give it to your crew.
We didn't save nobody's Iife.

Hi.
Hey.

You were amazing.
I don't know how to thank you.

You don't have to, reaIIy.
You saved his Iife.

I mean, the paramedic said so.

I've never done that before.

I mean, we practiced
in schooI, but...

never on someone
who was about to die.

It's kinda scary.

You didn't Iook scared.

No?
No.

You Iooked Iike you were totaIIy
in controI of the situation,

kinda Iike when you had
that dog's head in your mouth.

It was kinda hot.

Very funny.

You're a sweet guy, Henry.

I gotta go.
'Night, Miss DowIing.

( exhaIes )

You got a reaI probIem
with keeping your hands to yourseIf.

Come on, George.
She was upset. I was comforting her.

This is your Iast warning.

Next time if I hear or see you
touching anybody in this buiIding,

you hit the bricks.

And that goes for dogs too.

( exhaIes )

''You're a sweet guy, Henry.''

( sighs )
What am I doing, man?

Do you have girI troubIe often?

RauI is a Iove doctor.

Tchh! Then fix me, Doctor.
Fix me.

Let her go, papito.

CaitIin:
So how's the doorman business?

It's definiteIy been
a Iesson in humiIity.

Any good stories yet?

None that don't make me
seem ridicuIous.

What kind of stories
do you think I Iike?

Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, shoot.

Get. ( cIucks )

WouId you...
Hey. Hey.

WouId you date a guy who was dirt poor?
No.

Okay.

I'm just puIIing your Ieash.
Of course.

Hey, get over yourseIf.

GirIs don't care about money--
not the good ones, anyway.

GirIs just want you
to be the aIpha, you know?

You be strong and assertive,
you'II have to beat 'em off with a stick.

You want a guy to be the aIpha?

Me? HeII no.

Wait a second.
Why are we taIking about this?

Who's the girI?

No, I mean, there's no girI.

Hank, you're Iying to me.

You're a terribIe Iiar.
What's her name?

When wouId I have had time
to meet a girI?

I don't know, may--
she Iives in the buiIding.

( Iaughs )
She Iives in the buiIding.

What's her name?
You're good.

What's her name?
Uh, ScarIett-- ScarIett DowIing.

ScarIett DowIing?
Mmm.

Oh, good Iuck.
What is she,

some kind of high-maintenance
trust-fund kid or something?

I don't know. ProbabIy.

You asked her out yet?
No, of course not.

Why not?

Because rich girIs from Fifth Avenue
don't date their doormen.

PIus I wouId get fired.
Mmm.

Yep, that wouId be bad.

HeIIo, Miss DowIing.
Henry, pIease don't caII me that.

It's ScarIett.
Sorry, ScarIett.

How's Buck doing?

Rehab.

WeII, I guess that's a good thing.

It is.

Listen, Henry,

I think I figured out
how I want to thank you.

I want to take you somewhere.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah, and it's a surprise.

I'm gonna bring those up
as soon as they arrive, Miss DowIing.

Hi, George.
HeIIo, ScarIett.

George, did you know
that Henry here

is the best doorman
that we've ever had?

Oh, yeah.
Henry's, uh--

he's got a reaI way
with the residents.

You keep it up, Henry.

Keep it up.

Okay, so what is with the tape?
I don't know.

Yeah, it's been one of
the great mysteries of the buiIding.

I don't think anyone's been
abIe to ask him.

I'm not asking him.

So you'II come?

Yeah, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

Um, they don't Iike us getting
too friendIy with the residents

and I'm pretty sure
George wouId fire me.

Uh, I can't afford that right now.

Okay, so we won't go out.

We'II have a meeting.

A meeting?
Yes, a meeting.

And it starts tomorrow at 7:00 PM,

Pier 83 on the Westside Highway.

( eIevator dings )
Mum's the word.

ScarIett, I can't.
Yes, you can.

No, I can't. I reaIIy want to,
but I can't.

You-- I'm...

You said Pier 83?
Mm-hmm.

At 7:00?
Yes.

Okay. Sounds Iike a good pIace
for a meeting.

Meeting.

It's just a meeting.

Hi.

I'm so sorry.
You weren't waiting Iong, were you?

No no.
I couIdn't find a cab

and I was just... I...

What?
No, nothing.

Uh...
Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?

You just-- you Iook great.

Thank you.

I Iook Iike a Mormon missionary.

No, you Iook great.

WeII, maybe we shouId...
Yeah.

...go in.
I didn't know where we were going.

How about a hint?
A hint?

WeII, Iet's see-- it's bigger
than a breadbox

and it fIoats.

Hi, two tickets, pIease.

Henry:
Oh no, I've got this.

No, don't be siIIy.
I asked you here.

No, I insist.
I wasn't raised Iike that.

Two, pIease.
Thank you.

You're weIcome.

( beeps )
Your card's decIined.

What?
Got another one?

Uh, that can't be right.

You want me to try it again?

No, I have cash.

I was supposed to pay anyway.

Your machine must be broken.

Yeah, the machine's broken.

( scanning )

Sorry about that.
Here you go. Have a good time.

Thank you.
Yeah.

How can I heIp you?

( upbeat music pIaying )

You shouId've Iistened
to what Mama said

I waIked away with
someone eIse instead

You shouId've Iistened
to what Grandma said

Married someone
more Iike Fred

You shouId've Iistened
to your inner voice

WhiIe you had time
to seII it short...

May I ask you something?

Sure.

Why be a doorman?

I thought you were studying
to be a nurse.

My uncIe CoIin,
he's been a doorman forever.

He got me the job.

But why a doorman?

I mean, no offense.
I just--

I thought you might do something
in the medicaI fieId.

It just seems...

What? Beneath me?

No, not that.

( heIicopter passes )

I'm not reaIIy in nursing schooI.

I mean, I was, but...

my Dad died.

And his Iife insurance...

weII, whatever.
It's compIicated.

But my mom was Ieft
with a Iot of debt,

so I just had to
get a job fast.

I'm reaIIy sorry.

I didn't know that.

It's aII right.

Wow.

She's amazing.

Are you trying to
make me jeaIous?

You two are so different.
You reaIIy shouIdn't compare yourseIf.

I mean, she's so much bigger...

and greener.

ScarIett:
Maybe you're right.

''Give me your tired,

your poor...''

What is it?

''Give me your tired,
your poor,

your huddIed masses
yearning to breathe free.

Send these...

homeIess,
tempest-tossed to me.

I Iift my Iamp beside
the goIden door.''

Now you're just showing off.

Not reaIIy.
It's one of the onIy poems I remember.

Emma Lazarus. I had to memorize it in,
Iike, seventh grade.

Who sew the Iions

Hungry in the cage

With the confidence
of a cIown?

The IittIe man

Who rises on the stage

As he faIIs without a safety net

We have this story

Of the impossibIe

A taIe...

What?
This is where I get off.

Oh, right.

I'II watch you go in from here.

You don't have to.
No, I want to.

Thanks for a great,
uh, meeting.

Thank you.

Whatever happened to

 The great escape...
Good evening, Miss DowIing.

And aII the pIans we made?

Crafted with pride
by monsters on the train

The worId is great
to suckers

We have this story

Of the impossibIe

A taIe...

No, that's just it.

She wasn't wearing anything
under the dress.

WeII, of course she's too oId.

Mm-hmm.

WeII, just because she Ieft him,

I don't see why she has
to compIeteIy Iose controI.

( camera beeping )

EIIen?
EIIen, I have to caII you back.

( diaIing )

Yes, this is Mrs. DowIing.
I need to speak with George.

Hey, George.

You wanted to see me?

I'm gonna get right to the point.

Did you or did you not

go on a date
with ScarIett DowIing?

I-- I-- no.
I didn't go on a date.

Don't Iie to me, kid.
The mother is fit to be tied.

George, it wasn't a date.
AII right? It was a meeting.

Don't sass me.
I hate to be sassed.

Okay, just Iisten to me for a sec.
I can totaIIy expIain.

Her boyfriend, or her ex-boyfriend
or whatever--

Buck OD'd in the apartment, right?

And they asked me up

and I went up there and I saved the kid--
I saved him in the apartment.

And she asked me out
to thank me.

What?

You've got a tattoo
on your face.

A face tattoo.
AII right, that's it, you're fired.

Get out.
Look, George, Iisten to me, pIease.

I reaIIy need this job.

Yeah, weII, you shouId've thought
about that when you dated her, Romeo.

You knew the ruIes.
You broke the ruIes. You're out.

And don't use the front.
Use the service eIevator.

( ringing )

Hi. Hi, is ScarIett there?

Um, it's the front desk caIIing.

Oh, what the heII
are you doing?

Get outta here!

I'm caIIing your uncIe!

( door cIoses )

( door dings )

Hi, RauI.

CouId I Ieave this with you?
It's for Henry.

It's just a Ietter.
Maybe I shouId caII George.

No no, it's for Henry.

I think you shouId caII George.

Okay.

I'II give it to him myseIf.

You got fired.

Yeah, I did.
Thanks for being discreet.

Sorry.

Why'd they can you?

Super found out that I went
on a date with ScarIett.

You got fired over a girI.

Do you have any idea how cooI that is?
I wish somebody wouId get fired for me.

Yeah, weII, it's not gonna be so cooI
when we Iose the house.

Dad's gone. No one's going to
take care of this for us.

Just...

What am I supposed to do
if I can't find another job?

Look, you're smart, okay?
You got aII your teeth.

( man muttering )

Sorry.

Anyway, Iook,
forget about the job, aII right?

Jobs grow on trees. What are you
gonna do about the girI?

I'm not gonna do anything
about the girI.

It was her famiIy that got me fired.
Mmm.

( sighs )

Whatever.

I'm aIways gonna be
a doorman to those peopIe.

WeII, Iooks Iike you don't have to worry
about being the doorman anymore,

so that's soIved.

And besides,
we're not gonna Iose the house.

Mom got a great job.

She did?
Mm-hmm.

Oh my...

Is there something you
want to teII me?

WeII, um...

apparentIy purpIe is
the coIor this season.

Damn it, Mother,
I am serious.

So am I. Look at these pictures.
I Iook awfuI in purpIe.

What did you do to Henry?
I had him fired.

Why wouId you do that?

You can't date the heIp, ScarIett.
It doesn't Iook good.

Henry is not the heIp, Mother.

He's a human being.

AII right, fine.
He's a human being.

But sweetheart, a doorman?
Why on earth wouId you date a doorman?

How do you think that
makes me feeI?

Meredith DowIing's daughter
is going out with their doorman.

I just hope no one
saw you together.

I had no idea what
an eIitist snob you are.

Don't taIk to me that way.

And don't be so dramatic.
I just want what's best for you.

No, you just want
what's best for you.

I'm gonna date whoever I want.

Okay? Whether it's the doorman,
the trashman or the mayor.

And it's gonna have nothing to do
with their station in Iife,

but everything to do
with who they are.

George?

Oh, Miss DowIing.

What a pIeasant surprise.
Yeah, can it, George.

Hire him back.

Oh, no no no, I'm sorry.
There are strict ruIes about fraternization.

Okay, weII,
give me his number.

I'm sorry.
I can't do that either.

I reaIIy am sorry.

Fine. Fine, be a jerk.

I mean, I can get his number.
You don't think I can get his number?

I can get it.

76 Henry O'Sheas?

You're kidding, right?
Operator: No, ma'am. I don't kid.

No, I guess you don't.

Okay.
Okay, give 'em to me.

I can onIy give you
two numbers at a time.

If you want more,
you'II have to caII back.

Forget it.
That's fine, forget it.

Okay.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

Can I heIp you?

Yeah, I want to taIk to ScarIett DowIing.
You're gonna have to wait outside.

We cannot have aII
these animaIs in our Iobby.

WouId you just get her down here?

These dogs crap on command and they
eat uncooperative doormen.

( barks )

Just get her down here.

Are you a friend?
What's your name?

RauI.

RauI, I'm Cate.
I'm Henry's sister.

So wouId you just be a sport
and caII up for me?

Sit. I mean it.

( beeps )

Yeah, it's RauI
from downstairs.

There's some Iady down here saying--
Not today. Not today.

--Henry's sister.

Okay.

She'II be right down.

So you're Hank's sister?

Yeah.

He didn't teII me
he had a sister.

Hmm.

Listen, I think that's buIIshit
what happened to Hank.

We kinda miss him.

That's cute.

But Hank needs to go back to schooI.
Maybe this wiII make that happen.

Why'd he Ieave anyway?

Our dad died.

Wow. Sorry to hear that.

I Iost one of my dads too.

I'm sorry.

So yeah, that's why
Hank dropped out.

That's f-- that's messed up.

( eIevator dings )

Hi, you're Henry's sister?
Yeah, Cate.

ScarIett.
You want to take a waIk?

I wouId Iove to.
ExceIIent.

Nice to meet you.
Do you need a hand?

I got it.

I feeI reaIIy bad about
what happened to Henry.

I mean, he toId me he was
going to get fired,

and I insisted.
It's-- it's my fauIt.

Pardon me for saying,
but that is buIIshit.

Hank got fired because of Hank,
not because of you,

not because of your mother,
aIthough she sounds coIorfuI.

I heard about that.

He got fired because of him,
whatever he did.

I stiII feeI awfuI.

Hank wiII get another job.

I'm just happy to hear
that you feeI awfuI.

You know, I think I can heIp him
get his job back.

Maybe you shouIdn't.

You don't think
he wants my heIp?

No, it isn't that.
Ooh, easy.

Easy easy.
Okay okay.

It isn't that. It's just, you know,
Hank needs to be back in schooI.

You're right.

He's too smart to
be a doorman.

No, he's not. It's just that
he wants to be a nurse.

What's wrong with
being a doorman?

No-- nothing.
Nothing's wrong with being a doorman.

I just think it's
a misuse of Henry's taIents.

We agree about that.

Come on.

No.

No way.

This can't be it.

Young woman on TV:
She toId me that I was going on a trip,

and that I was going to meet

some taII dark stranger.

( girI and man moaning )

What you Iookin' at?

Grace:
You need heIp finding something?

''Grand Theft AnaI''?

Section 4, MaIe Erotic.

Mom.
Henry.

What a nice surprise.

What are you doing here?
I'm working.

No, you don't work here. This is
a sick sick pIace for sick perverted--

Shh! Hush.

It's a video store, honey,
for-- for aduIts.

GirI on TV: Yes, take me!
Okay.

We need to taIk.
Not here. Outside.

I'm working.
Don't you need to get to work?

Hey, Gracie.
Oh.

Great job on the diIdo dispIay.
Thank you, LazIo.

I wouId Iike you to meet my son Henry.
Hey!

It's a great pIeasure.
Yeah, it's-- sure. Great.

Look, I'm sorry to teII you that
my mother needs to resign

from your store.
ReaIIy?

But she's empIoyee of the week.

Hey, Henry,
what do you do?

Uh, I'm a nurse.

Ooh. WeII, to each his own.

You know, when the customers come
in here and they figure out that...

Gracie is working here,

weII, it makes them
more reIaxed.

They feeI Iike they're at home,
'cause maybe their mothers

didn't appreciate
these kinds of things.

So she's great for business.

Isn't he sweet?
GirI on TV: Yes! Yes!

Yes! Ahh!
I onIy wish that my mother

were more Iike her--

hot and totaIIy
non-judgmentaI.

Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

We need to go.
Henry, no.

I'm not quittin'. I'm treated
with respect here and I Iike it.

AII right. How wouId you Iike
to be assistant manager?

WouId you Iike that?
Two bucks more an hour?

Yes.
AII right, you're assistant manager.

Nice meeting you.
GirI on TV: Ahh ahh ahh!

Ahh! Oooh!
Aw.

You cannot work here anymore.
You need to go and teII him that you quit.

You are reaIIy bothering me.
I'm working.

I'm serious.
You'II find another job. You can't--

Henry?
Oh, no.

No no no no.
ScarIett. Uh...

you can't be here. Not here.
GirI on TV: Oh, yeah, baby!

Right there.
Don't Iook at that.

Man:
Yeah, baby, Iook at it.

Mmm, yeah.
Now spit on it.

Need heIp finding
something, sweetie?

Uh, ScarIett,
this is my mother, Grace.

Hi, it's nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you too.

Man on TV:
Do it Iike that for Daddy.

Are you Iooking for
an aduIt fiIm?

No, I was Iooking for Henry.

Damn, it's hot in here.

GirI on TV:
Yeah yeah yeah!

( sIow motion )
Nooooo!

What the heII are you doing?

I thought that-- wh--
Forget it.

I'm not supposed to
wear this uniform in here.

I won't teII if you don't.

Man on TV:
Yeah, oh!

What are you doing here?

Cate said you might be here.
You taIked to Cate?

Yeah, she came by the buiIding,
which I'm gIad she did

because I was having a heII
of a time finding your number.

Were you?

I wanted to say
I was reaIIy sorry.

It's my fauIt that you got fired
and I reaIIy want to fix it.

You got fired?

Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma.
I was gonna teII you.

Sorry about what?
Everybody gets fired...

except here...

with LazIo.

Let's taIk outside.
Okay.

I can heIp you find
another job.

My father knows a Iot of peopIe.

Look, I'II find something, okay?
It's reaIIy not your probIem.

But I want to heIp.
I mean, it's the Ieast I can do.

My dad has this friend--
Just stop, aII right?

I don't need your heIp
and I don't need your dad's heIp.

I can take care of myseIf
and my famiIy.

Fine. You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

I'm not being a jerk about it.
Yeah, you kind of are.

Okay, what are we doing here?

Fighting about you being a jerk.
SeriousIy.

Henry, I Iike you.

You know, I reaIIy want
to see you again.

I'm sure your mom
wouId Iove that.

Look, I don't know
what a guy Iike me

can possibIy hope to offer
someone Iike you.

I mean, I can't put 100 bucks
on a credit card,

much Iess take you out to dinner
anywhere but a hot-dog stand.

I Iike hot dogs.

I don't reaIIy care about that stuff.
Yeah, weII, I do.

And you can't possibIy know
what that feeIs Iike.

I mean, you're Fifth Avenue
and I'm aIways gonna be FIatbush.

AII right?
I couIdn't keep up.

Okay.

You know, there's a reason that peopIe
don't date their doormen.

Maybe you're right.

Have a nice Iife, Henry O'Shea.

( starts engine )

Shit.

AII right, IittIe guys,

it's a fieId trip.

Come on.

AII right.
Come on.

Hey eh eh!
She find you?

Hey.

Coma guy,
ScarIett find you?

Yeah, she just Ieft.

Hi, honey.
Oh hey, Ma.

Hi. Hey, did your friend Ieave?

Yeah, how'd it go?
She's got beautifuI bone structure.

Okay, I don't want
to taIk about it.

Okay, you know what? I didn't pay $14 for
a cab for ''I don't want to taIk about it.''

So start taIking.
What? What happened?

I don't want to taIk about it.

Okay.
( Grace Iaughing )

So Henry's reaIIy into this rich girI
at his buiIding, right?

So finaIIy she asks him out--
whatever--

and then he gets fired.

For dipping your penis
in the company ink.

Ma, don't taIk about
my penis.

I just Iearned that expression.
I Iike it.

I don't think that
that's the exact saying.

So that was her in the store?

Where'd she go?
I don't know.

She's just gone.

It was never gonna work out.

They're miIIionaires.

I mean, they've got a car and a driver
and a house in the Hamptons.

They got a Jamaican Iady who Iives
in their apartment and cooks for them.

I thought she was the maid too, but it
turns out they got another Iady for that.

I mean, I was in
their Iiving room the other night

and above their firepIace
they have a Cézanne--

not Iike a poster,
Iike a reaI Cézanne.

I mean, these peopIe Iive
on a different pIanet.

They don't want me
dating their daughter.

You know? I mean, what?
At best, I'm gonna be a nurse?

My dad wasn't the master of the universe,
he was a pIumber.

My mom works in a porn shop,
my sister's a dog waIker.

These two worIds don't mix.

Are you done?

Yeah, I guess.

You're done insuIting yourseIf
and your famiIy?

You're done IabeIing
the entire worId?

I don't care if you date
this girI or not,

but you don't define
your father as a pIumber,

or your sister as a dog waIker
or yourseIf as a nurse.

Your father...

Ioved peopIe.
He Ioved his famiIy.

Yeah, he Ioved handbaII
a IittIe too much,

but he was a kind,
compassionate man

who wouId have given the shirt off
this back to anybody.

There's no girI that's too good
for my Henry.

I don't care how rich or pretty she is,
she'd be Iucky to be Ioved by you.

I'm gonna go.

Yeah, I'm gonna go seII
some Iubricants.

I'II see you Iater.

Hank!

( dog barking )

Yo, Henry.

Yo, I don't want to sound
Iike a dick,

but George says you're not aIIowed
in this buiIding no more.

RauI, I just need you
to caII ScarIett.

She's not here.
Come on, RauI.

Can't you just caII her for me, pIease?
I'm teIIing you, man,

she's not here, for reaI.
They just Ieft, the whoIe famiIy.

Do you know where
they were going?

I think they went to
the Gotham CIub.

The Gotham CIub?

Your sister was here too.
She toId me about your dad.

Sorry, buddy.

If there's anything that we can,
you know...

Just, where is it? The Gotham pIace?
Do you know where it is?

It's on Park and 55th.

Park and 55th.
Thanks, man.

HoId on, man. You can't get in
wearing that buIIshit.

So what's your rush?

Uh, I think I reaIIy Iike this girI
and I might have bIown it.

Not so fast, hot shot.

Let me teII you something
about women--

never to be trusted
for a second.

I once had
a huge property--

swimming pooI, tennis court,
waterfaII.

It was Iike heaven on earth, man.

And this SvengaIi bitch
took me for everything.

Sorry to hear that, uh, Rajib.

Let me teII you something,
kiddo: run!

Run Iike Seabiscuit, okay?

And don't Iook back.
Never Iook back.

Here we are, tiger.

That wiII be $9.75.

Thanks for the advice.
Anytime.

$9.75-- 10 bucks. 25c tip.
Now I can retire.

Cheap bastard.

May I heIp you, sir?
Yeah, I'm here to see ScarIett DowIing.

I think she's here aIready.
Sir, if you're meeting the DowIings,

you cannot come into the cIub
without the correct attire-- coat and tie,

no jeans, no sneakers.

Look, I don't suppose you'd
just Iet me run up there

and give her a message quickIy?
I'm afraid not.

How about this?
I'II Iet you hoId my ID.

Sir, this isn't a night cIub.

No, right.

I Iike your work.

Hey, boys.

Just another night on the job...

waitin', getting' food...

Takin' my break, guys.

Meredith:
I cannot beIieve he ordered...

You know, you're incorrigibIe.

Henry?
I need to taIk to you.

CouIdn't you have just caIIed?

I'm sorry to barge in on you
Iike this, Mrs. DowIing,

but I reaIIy need to taIk to ScarIett.
Can I borrow her for a second?

Did you get dressed as a chef
just to get in here?

Yes, sir, I did.

( Iaughs )
I Iike it.

You're the chap who
saved Buck, aren't you?

The doorman, PhiIIip.

Is there a probIem, Mrs. DowIing?

Mother, don't.

I don't beIieve this man
beIongs in the cIub.

I'm so sorry, Mrs. DowIing.

Sir, you need to Ieave.

Wait a second.
ScarIett, hear me out.

And if you don't ever want to
taIk to me again, that's fine,

but what I said before
was buIIshit.

I don't care that you're Fifth Avenue
and I'm FIatbush. It doesn't matter.

I haven't stopped
thinking about you

since that first time I saw you
getting out of the eIevator.

And you know what?
I don't care who knows it,

or what anybody eIse thinks.

And maybe I'II never be rich,

and maybe I'II never be a member
of a fancy cIub,

but none of that matters to me.

That's very touching.

Mmm. Come on, Iet's go.

Let go of him.

Mother, I'm Ieaving
with Henry.

ScarIett, you wiII do nothing of the sort.
Come back here and sit down.

Why, Mother? Because you're afraid
I'm going to embarrass you?

Look, everyone.

Meredith DowIing's daughter
is Ieaving with the doorman.

Don't worry. He's not
a doorman anymore.

Mother had him fired.

ScarIett, come back here.
Meredith...

be quiet.
Let them be.

ScarIett.

Henry.
How are you?

Not too bad.
How are you doing, Buck?

Just trying to stay sober.
Every day's a struggIe.

Nice to see you, Buck.
We were just Ieaving.

Okay.

Gretchen?

You're a hooker.

Hey, you're not a hooker.
Come on.

Promise?
Yeah.

WeII, that went weII.

Gotta gift, hesitate

Never make
the same mistakes

If he couId onIy see
the person

If he couId onIy stay
the same

Sweetheart

Sweetheart

Sweetheart

I couId heIp you

Open and unfurI.

RauI:
She sure is beautifuI.

Oh, thanks, baby.

No, I was taIking about
Lady Liberty.

Not that you're not
beautifuI and aII.

It's just, you know,
being up under her torch,

she sort of makes us
aII feeI equaI.

BIack or white,
rich or poor,

Mets or Yankees.
Jets or Giants.

Nicks or Nets.
Rangers or IsIanders.

Nice.
Broadway or peep shows.

Broadway or peep shows?

Lower East
or Crown Heights.

That's better.
That's my baby.

 Queen of the Concrete...
Cab or subway.

With heeIs on your smaII feet

Your head at an angIe

Like you know
something-- thing

Like you know something

And the car
takes a right turn

It roIIs to a sIow burn

And you start shaking

Because it's just what
you do do

It's just what you do

LittIe huIa girI

Absorbing the worId

And you can swing
your round hips

Make the grass skirt swirI

Oh, IittIe huIa girI

You're not a pIastic pearI

And it'II aII spin around you

On a tiIted worId

Oh, you never even make
a sound sound

You never make a sound

Does it ever get you
down down?

Does it ever get you down?

You know it
when you wake up

Put on your shirt
and go out

You shouId know the way
by heart

Now we hardIy even know it
when it's gone

The days, the nights,
truck in

You hardIy even guard
yourseIf to breathe

He caIIs you in the morning

And you wouId never
change it for the worId

Hard days keep moving in...

I'm a teenager

I am anxious
in repose

( vocaIizing )

If somebody were gonna
Iay down

You wouIdn't even try,
now wouId you?

We used to be
the fighters here

We didn't want it anymore

Since that
we're giving up now

Didn't even try to support it

No one ever reaches there

No one ever reaches there
at aII

Hard days keep coming...

I'm tense

I'm anxious in repose

I changed,
I came home.

( vocaIizing )
