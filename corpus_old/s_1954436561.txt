where we say goodbye</i>

<i># I promise I'll try to
make it stick this time</i>

<i># I always love breaking
up with you 'cause</i>

<i># The more bitter it got,
the better</i>

<i># The making up
with you was</i>

<i># And I think we can agree
on the following things</i>

<i># I'm an asshole and
you're kinda needy</i>

<i># I said it was casual</i>

<i># And you pretended
to believe me</i>

<i># Our glass is empty</i>

<i># At our best it
was only half full</i>

<i># I only love you
when you're leaving</i>

<i># And I'm an asshole #</i>

Mary Beth?
Yeah?

Hold on.

Can you do a dinner run?
Sure.

You know what time it is?
Sandwiches?

How long we going to do this?
We're going to do it until it's right.

Gotta call my wife.

<i># Stuck in your confines</i>

<i># Chewin' it over</i>

<i># Caught in
your headlights</i>

<i># Stop staring... #</i>

Hey, you seen Stiles?

Nah?
I guess it's no.

...employees. Not in billing. Not in
awards even. We're right back here.

I think everyone knows everyone.
Hi, Carl. - Brent.

Good to see you again. - Good to see you,
Keri. - Thank you so much for coming.

If you wouldn't mind
sitting right here? - Sure.

You have a presentation
pack in front of you

if you want to get
a sneak peek at, uh...

I guess what I'm
trying to say, Carl,

is that the other four agencies
are probably laughing,

at the fact that we're
even in the running

for your business.

We're not laughing.

<i>- Hey, Dad. - Where are you?
I'm at the library.</i>

<i>- Meet me at the Belle.
No, I got class. - Cut it.</i>

Weren't you supposed to be
riding me about going to class?

<i>Hey, I'm payin' for it.
I say cut it, all right?</i>

<i>Get somebody
else's notes.</i>

Your old man just, uh,
knocked one out of the park,

and I wanna celebrate
with you.

Whatever happened to free choice?
No, that's a myth.

<i>Come on, I'm already in the car.
I'll meet you in half an hour.</i>

<i>Hey, it's Josh,
leave a message.</i>

Yup, it's me again.
Not cool blowin' off your dad.

All right, well, call me
over the weekend. Bye.

Hey, can I... Can I get
some volume on this?

Hey, excuse me!

Can I get some sound?
Can you turn this up, please?

<i>A tragedy of this magnitude...
absolutely heartbreaking</i>

<i>in the fact that it happened in
our own backyard, unbelievable.</i>

Anything?
No. - Oh.

<i>The parents of Sarah Clark,
an Honor Roll student...</i>

Well, all you can do
is be there for him.

<i>...just passed behind me,
obviously distraught.</i>

<i>Family members tell me that
ever since she was a little girl,</i>

<i>Sarah had dreamed
of becoming a nurse.</i>

... quite a bit.
Yeah.

They were young,
that's what counts.

You be strong.

Thank you for coming.

I'd have walked
if I had to.

I'm going to be so
worried about you.

Brent and I want you to know
that we are here for you.

You have got to let go
of this, honey. Just cry.

You're just being too strong
Give me a call, sweetie, okay?

Oh, God.

I'm sorry.

Ms. Tamburg said
I could come up.

I'm Kate.

I was Josh's...

Sort of, we dated.

For about a year.

That's me.

You're his dad, right?

You're Sam.

He spoke about you.

Highly of you.

He was really sweet to me.

He was always
very sweet to me.

Honey.

I'm sorry.
Oh.

I'm so sorry.
I know, honey.

I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

I know.

Okay! It's him.
We got him.

All right,
let's rock and roll.

Okay, lemme get a three-quarter shot.
Good, good, good.

Catch him out of the car.
Catch him out of the car.

Mr. Manning! Have you spoken
to any of the other parents?

Has anybody been
in contact with you?

Mr. Manning,
how was the funeral?

Just a statement.
Mr. Manning!

Mr. Manning!
Please, just one second.

Mr. Manning,
how is your ex-wife?

Fuck!

Oh, shit.

Hey, excuse me.
Do you have a back way out?

Yeah...
An exit?

You do?
Oh, never mind.

Just, uh, keep it.

Mr. Manning?

Mr. Manning!
I hate to bother you.

Oh, yeah? Well, if you hated it so much,
you wouldn't be doin' it, would you?

Do you feel that the school
bears any responsibility for...

You know, lemme ask
you a question first.

You're a heartless,
bottom-feeding motherfucker.

Well, I guess it's not really
a question, is it?

Sam.
Hey. I'm fine.

I'm okay. I'm serious.
Hey, hey, hey.

Sam! - Does that seem
like I'm not okay?

You shouldn't be here, okay?
You should probably go home.

Hey, hey. Wanna come inside?
Check how fine I really am.

Sam!

How nice to see you, too!

She can't keep
her hands off me.

Professional help.
Yes, yes, yes.

How many times
did you go see him?

Well, I mean, I didn't actually
see the guy yet, but...

I didn't see him, but I did talk to him
on the phone, and... Nice guy.

Listen.

We're doing fine here.

Take the time that you need to...
Hey, hey.

I appreciate that concern.
I really do.

But what I need is to work.

What I need is to come in here every
day and I'm gonna sell some tacos.

Okay? I gotta write
some catchy copy

and I gotta put
on a suit, tie and smile.

Face the future.
That...

That's what I need.

Sam, I need to talk to you.

Late for work.
Catch me tonight.

No, this is important.
Late for work, Alard.

No, this is important! I implore you.
We can walk and talk.

Was beginning to wonder if you
needed a written invitation

to come to work today.
No invitation necessary.

Days with these fine gentlemen
is what I get out of bed for.

Don't be late again.

You know what I'm sayin'?

Don't be late again.

Yeah, you wouldn't
wanna lose this job, huh?

You wanna get
a beer after work?

Me and Carlos are gonna go
over to Trill to get some.

I don't drink.

You best check your cologne,
because...

you smell like you drink.

Evenin'.

<i># Don't call me
whore in the morning</i>

<i># Don't call me baby when
you want me in your bed</i>

<i># Then you leave me
at 4:00 in the morning</i>

<i># I should have kicked you
in the balls instead</i>

<i># Then you tell me
that you're sorry</i>

<i># And that the girl that I
saw you at the Walmart with</i>

<i># Wasn't anybody...</i>

Hey, man, I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

Yeah, what you drinkin'?

Uh, I'm gonna get a Mustang Wheat.
No lemon. - Wheat?

<i>#You're whore!</i>

<i>#She's the whore!</i>

<i># Don't call me
whore in the morning</i>

So what's your
story anyway, man?

I mean,

why you paintin' houses?

And don't give me that shit
about NASA again.

All right, promise
you won't tell?

I'm in the witness
protection program.

I fingered Gotti.

Fine.
Don't tell me.

I don't give a shit.
Dick.

<i># As a reminder not to date assholes
And throw my life away</i>

<i># I'm not the whore!
You're the whore! You're the whore! #</i>

Thank you.

Okay!
That was, uh...

That was Peaches.
Thank you... Peaches.

<i>Next we have Nic Harvard.
Nic! Come on up!</i>

<i># It was a long, long time ago
and far, far away</i>

<i># I guess you could say
it was like every other day</i>

<i># Found myself on broken
streets wanderin' around</i>

<i># Lookin' for a place that I
can lay my troubles down #</i>

Hey, stranger.

You're not really gonna
stroll up acting like

we're running into one another
at the mall? - Oh, this is gonna be

one of those moments where no
matter what I say, it's wrong, isn't it?

Tell me, Sam,
how should I be acting?

What is the appropriate tone
for having to track down

your ex-husband who's hiding out two
and a half hours away on a boat?

I'm not hiding.

You're not hiding?
What do you want, Em?

Your signature. I'm putting
the house on the market.

And I'm here. And I'm tired. And
I have a long drive ahead of me.

Could've forged it.

You're right, I could've.

Maybe I was worried about you.
Should I be worried?

I'm fine. Come on, I'm livin'
the dream. On a boat.

It's marked everywhere
I need a signature.

His name's Phillip.

Wow. Okay.
Yeah.

He's 11 months old.

That's fantastic.

He is a miracle.

A $200,000 miracle,
but he is a...

beautiful, healthy boy.

We're moving to Tulsa.

Tom's dad isn't
doing so well.

That's great.

I mean, I'm sorry.

And I finally decided
to let go of a few things.

I saved this for you.
Music was always you guys' thing.

I couldn't even
open the boxes.

Hold on, I don't
have room for that.

What do you mean? - Like, the boat.
It's not big enough. Sorry.

You can't be serious.
What do want me to say?

I don't know. It took me over two
years to get to a point where I can

clean out his room, and you,
you don't care about his stuff?

That's not fair.
Isn't it?

Well, get pissed! It's not going to
make my boat any bigger. - No! No!

If you wanna act like
Josh never existed,

if hiding makes it
easier for you, great.

But make no mistake,
you are hiding!

Hey, what do you
say there, Alard?

It's Alaird.

Ooh, these are the kind of
days worth working for, huh?

I just wanna be forthright
and honest. - Oh, good.

I had to file another complaint about
you relieving yourself in the lake.

The rules are quite clear.
Alard...

Do you realize how many of our
conversations are about my penis?

You're not nearly as funny
as you think you are.

This is a family lake.
You've been warned.

<i># Don't say a word
about your plans</i>

<i># Maybe I don't give a damn</i>

<i># Don't say a word
about your plans... #</i>

You here to play?
Just you?

Sign-up's right there.

Can I get a Mustang Wheat?

Brian out was terrific.

I hate to said this, I love it
when women break your heart

because you write beautiful
love songs about them.

Give it up for Brian.

No lemon.

<i># Maybe I...
I should stay</i>

<i># I'm better off your way</i>

<i># Show your faith</i>

<i># You got a lot of nerve

That was fantastic.

<i>Tolly and Tina,
everybody.</i>

<i>Uh, next we have...</i>

<i>Alard Dick.</i>

Tolly, that was
really nice.

Thanks.

Yo! You can't take
that outside.

Excuse me?
Uh, excuse me.

That was awesome.

And when I say awesome, I mean
"hairs on my neck stand up" awesome.

I wanted to say something to you earlier,
but you look... scary.

I'm glad that you liked it.
Oh, yeah. I'm not blowing smoke.

That song had something going on.
Something deep.

I'm Quentin.

Well, good to meet you,
Quentin.

Don't let the brain dead
back there get to you.

I mean, they... I'm here every week and
they wouldn't know greatness if it...

They just wouldn't know it.
They wouldn't... know it.

I don't mean to be rude,
but you're, uh,

you're quite drunk, Mr. Dick.

Do you want me to
give you a ride?

Oh, crap.
Crap.

Hey!

So you gonna come back and play?
Thank you for the ride.

Knock, knock.

Hello.

Hello?

Hello!
Oh, for fuck's sake.

You're supposed to
be invited on board.

Sorry, sorry.
Stop. Come back.

Is that for me?
Yeah.

I thought you might like a donut. Buck's
Space Age. They're like edible heaven.

Good, as in I'd have
one over sex.

Well, you're doing it
wrong, then.

So is this even, uh, legal?

Not that. That's...
That is not even sanitary.

I mean, living on a... - You're here
to give me a ticket, Quentin?

No. No, no, no. And I'm not like your
ewest stalker or anything. I just...

I just can't get that song
out of my head.

'Round and 'round and around,
and I'm laying there and I think,

"What it needs is a harmony. "

Nothing over the top.
Just simple.

And then I think, "If that song is
that good, there have to be others. "

And if there are others,
someone ought to play them.

We could play them.
Let me stop you right there.

I'm not interested.

Sure, no. Right. Totally,
I get ahead of myself sometimes.

Are there other songs?

Thank you for the coffee.

Sure.

Just to clarify, you don't want
to play at the Trill again,

or you don't want
to play with me?

Thank you for the coffee.

Yeah, yeah.

Excuse me?

You're here every week
for a shower.

Wife pissed at you?
No.

Nope.
No wife, no kids.

Live on a boat.

Sexy for everything except
for taking a shower.

Mr. Dick?
Oh.

Ah, sorry, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

It's Quentin,
in case you forgot.

I have to put a bell
around your neck.

I missed you the other night.
Kinda held out hope.

You know, I don't get the
appeal of fishing. - Really.

Well, I would imagine that most
activities performed in silence

don't make
much sense to you.

Uh, permission
to come aboard?

If I say yes,

you promise to help
with dinner? - Done.

All right.
Here, clean these.

Uh...

Mr. Dick, I don't know
if I can do this.

Don't call me Mr. Dick.

Okay, Alard.
Don't call me Alard either.

Well, if I need to talk to you,
should I just whistle? - Call me Sam.

Okay, why not?
Think you can handle that?

You never told me if you've written others,
but I'm guessing you have because...

it doesn't really sound like a first
try kind of tune. - Back to this, huh?

What I don't understand is,
you don't write stuff like this

if you don't want
people to hear it.

<i># I don't know where
the days have gone</i>

<i># But I know
I wanna go home #</i>

No, uh, it's not...
"But I know where I belong. "

<i># I know where I belong #</i>

Right?
Yeah.

<i># I want to go... #</i>

Do that part,
do the last part again.

<i># I don't know where
the days have gone</i>

<i># But I know
where I belong</i>

<i># I wanna go home #</i>

Oh, fuck! Wait, go back to the part.
No, no, no, the, uh, um...

be my friend</i>

<i># If I broke into
your house</i>

<i># Pissed in your shoes</i>

<i># I'd still be
friends with you</i>

What don't you understand about,
"Do that. "

<i># 'Cause that's what
real friends do #</i>

Anyway, thank you.
Yeah, thank you for coming by.

Those were good jams.
That was okay.

No, really good jams.
Yeah.

Yeah, it was pretty great.
Okay.

All right.
Okay.

You seriously have no desire
to go out and play those?

Good night, Quentin.
Just hold on. Hold on.

You heard us, right?
You can't tell me that didn't

dial you up just a little bit.
It was nice, okay? - Nice?

Are you kidding...
Hold on, hold on. Nice?

That was not
just nice, okay?

I've played with people before,
and it's always sucked.

It's always sucked because
most things, they suck!

That wasn't just nice, okay?

Are you... I bet that was even
better than you imagined...

Fine, I'll play the song.

Really?

If it'll get you to go home right now.
I'm gone. I'm out. I'm home.

You're not messing
with me, right?

We're going to rehearse and
we'll play? - You're still here.

I'm out, I'm out.
I'm gone.

Hey, your name
really is Sam, right?

<i># Be by you, be by you</i>

<i># All I want
is to be by you</i>

<i># Be by you, be by you</i>

<i># All I want
is to be by you</i>

<i># Be by you, be by you #</i>

Hey, you must be Sam.

I won't tell you how Quentin
told me to recognize you.

Ah, well, I can only guess.
Aiken, this is Tolly.

We met, but you were
really drunk.

Oh, nice to meet you, again.

You know where
I can find him?

Bathroom. Think he's a
little nervous. He does this.

Can you watch this?

You okay in there?
Great.

Great.
Almost done.

In case you forgot, you know,
this was, uh, your idea.

Yeah, I know.
Weird, right?

Quentin.

There are 14 people
in the audience.

And 10 of them
are performers.

You launching
the space shuttle?

I worked a little something up.
Trust me.

Just don't throw up.

That's helpful.
You're helpful. So, so helpful.

Oh, man.
You are in for a treat.

You taking care of my baby?

I'd be years into my
retirement before you got

enough money to take it home, son.
You're sunny personality is

what keep's me coming back, Del. - Well,
I guess I ought to be nicer to you then.

I think that's the nicest
he's ever been to me.

Seriously.

Does it get any
prettier than that?

Expensive taste.

'78 Gibson Les Paul.
Rosewood solid body.

Gold-plated humbucker pickups.
Pearl inlays.

Pure perfection.

You stock Dean Markley
Blue Steels?

I do.

Get three packs?

Hope you're not in a hurry.

I take it he's in here a lot.

I've figured I've made a dime for
every hour he's spent in here. $18.95.

You goin' somewhere there?
Got yourself a motor home?

That is my missus' dream.

She says it'll be romantic.

Sounds more to me like getting
your prostate kicked for

eight hours a day until you're dead.
So you're looking forward to it, huh?

Can't hardly wait.

Willie!
I thought that was your truck!

Hey! Quite right,
that is my truck. It is.

So what's new with you?
Not much.

Not much. What about you? Are you
still playing with those guys in Edmond?

Not for a few months, man.

Been so long since I played with
anyone else, I can hardly remember.

Are you kidding me?
You?

You're, like, the best bass player
I've ever heard! - Yeah, well...

Seriously, man, don't worry.

Some band is gonna snatch you up.
You're a magician!

So...

Well, it was good to see you!
Yeah, great! See you, guys!

What?

I don't know if I should be
impressed by the effort

or insulted that you think
you can pull that off.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Okay.

All right, fine.

Willie plays bass and I think a bass
would really bring the songs to life.

I'm too old to start a band.
Start a band?

No. I don't...
We're not...

I don't wanna start a band.

I just think a little bass
would make us sound better.

Can we go?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Voilà. Not bad, huh?
You could even park a car in here.

Oh, you like the Lips?

Yeah, I like the poster. Where...
Is this your parents' place?

No, no. Ruth...
I'm sort of the caretaker.

My apartment's upstairs.
You from around here?

No, not...
Not really.

Um, do you want a drink? - Well, where
you from? What do your folks do?

It's complicated.
Er, let me see what I got.

Got water and a... more water.
Pretty much water.

Dude! You killed it, man!
Can you give me a hand?

Hey, did you get the chords
and lyrics? - Yeah, I got 'em.

'Sup Sam!
Good to see you again.

Yep. Hi, Willie.
Let me get that piece.

How do you come up
with this shit?

Oh, they just come to me.
You write on guitar or keyboard?

Yep, they just come.

'60s Marshall?

Oh, good eye. You like it?
Is Chuck Norris a badass?

This thing's like new, man.
I mean, crisp.

You must've dropped
some serious cash.

A couple of dollars. You guys ready.
Let's go! - All right, let's do this.

So it goes D to B minor.
Sort of circles around a little bit.

All right, I got that, yeah.
Bridge goes G major, E minor, B minor...

Yeah. I got it.
It got it.

All right, well, just listen in for a couple
verses and join in when you're ready.

No, I got it.

Okay.

Think you guys could put together
enough songs to play a full set?

Thinking of making you
a regular on Saturdays.

Seriously?

Yeah! - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, we only know four songs.

Well, we'll do covers.
Yeah, we're in.

Last call, by the way.

That's what I'm
talking about. Yeah!

Hey, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, I already have a job.

Oh, well, wouldn't
wanna jeopardize that.

Heard you might get
promoted to sanding.

Sam?
Sam!

Alard! Moment of your time?
Oh, for you, pal? Two.

The board has asked me to ask you if
you would consider moving your boat

for the regatta.

There's a regatta?
I hadn't heard.

Can we count on you? This is
the premier event of our season.

We'd like you to anchor on
the south end of the lake.

I'll tell you what.

I'll be on my best behavior if you stop
circulating that petition, or whatever,

trying to get me
kicked off the lake.

You think I don't
know about that?

The name's Alaird,
by the way!

I'll move the fucking boat!

Well? - He's moving the boat.
All right.

<i># Stuck in your confines</i>

<i># Chewin' it over</i>

<i># Caught in your headlights</i>

<i># Stop staring</i>

<i>Hey, you seen Stiles?</i>

<i>Nah? I guess it's no.</i>

<i>Got to get out
of this place.</i>

<i># Don't know
what's in my mind</i>

<i># What am I thinkin'?</i>

<i># Whatever I say is a lie</i>

<i># Should I be drinkin'?</i>

<i># Stop fucking singin' #</i>

We thought 'cause...
No, I get it.

You know, 'cause your
boat and all. - I get it.

You don't like it.
No, it's fine.

Sam hates the name.
What? No way.

I don't hate the name.

Man, I told you it
was too artsy, bro.

Don't blame me, I liked
"The Old Man and the Three. "

Hey, man, I got a big day tomorrow,
so I'm gonna head home.

You want me to send one of
them over here on my way out?

Come on.

Look, I can get my head around
the stage fright, but not this.

They're just hoping to talk to you guys.
This is fish in a barrel.

So, I'll see you tomorrow?

What's the worse that could happen?
Gee, I don't know.

I think looking like an idiot and
fainting would rank right up there.

Okay, so don't do that.

You know,
your advice sucks.

Does it?
Oh, yes, yes it does.

Bad. Like, but just
listen to yourself.

I say, "I'm nervous. "
You say, "Don't be nervous. "

I say, "I feel sick. "
You say, "Don't puke. "

I say "I don't wanna go over there... "
Okay, I get it. I get it.

All right, well, first listen.

Don't go to hit on them.
Go over to talk to them.

I just wanna drink my beer.
No, you don't. - Yeah.

No, no they're
begging to talk to you.

So stand up.
Good man. Listen.

You're gonna ask them about the show.
A little market research.

See if they like the band.
Okay? Come on.

Look, try to focus on them.
All right?

Go. All right, go.
Have a nice night.

Who's winning?
Oh, God. He's killin' me, man.

I'm yankin' his heart, bro.

Did you just...
I did. It's kinda cool.

# Rely on your friends
they will get you through

<i># They're there for you... #
Hey, Sam!</i>

My kid sister saw you guys. She
thought you guys were excellent!

What was excellent?
Your band!

My band?
Yeah! Your band.

My kid sister saw you guys and
thought you guys were great.

Well, yeah, tell her...
Tell her thanks!

<i># Don't let it
get you down</i>

<i># It will bury you, very soon
Oh, yeah #</i>

Effects pedals?
Don't judge.

Oh, I wouldn't
dream of it.

What you lookin' for? - A good loop.
I wouldn't call any of them good,

but I happen to have some quality
ones to your right there.

I don't understand, man.
I just don't understand.

Why not play an instrument that
works with the power off?

Thank you for coming in, Fred.
Yeah, bye, Del.

That's the Korg.
It's very popular.

If you ask me, the Keeley's better.
Okay. Sold.

Big spender?
Mmm-hmm.

You are a godsend, Sam.

What?

You know, what you're doing
for that boy.

So, let's see...
I'll give you 20% off of that,

so it's gonna be $174.52.

We'll call it an even $180.
There ya go.

Hey, hey, Sam.

Forgettin' somethin'?

There you go.
Okay.

Did you write that?
Oh, Jesus.

Haven't you heard
of knocking?

Is that yours? - Yeah, yeah.
It's not... It's not finished.

Can I hear it? - No, no. Now is...
Now is not... Not a good time.

Oh, yeah.
You seem really busy.

Oh!

Hi.
Hey. Hello.

Uh, Joyce,

this is Sam.

We play in a band together.
Nice to meet you.

I should...
Yeah.

Just drive carefully, okay?

Call me sometime.

I will.

You wanna go to the mall?

Oh, come on. Lighten up, man.
You think I haven't been there?

Been where?

Well, you know. Desperate times
call for yada, yada, yada...

You know,
the girls in the Trill.

I mean, the phrase "fistful of 20s
in a whorehouse" comes to mind.

Joyce is my mom.

<i>Excuse me.</i>

God, sorry.
Quentin, I'm sorry, man.

I'm really...

For what it's worth, you have
a very attractive, young mom.

You want me
to set you two up?

It's tough when
she shows up.

She's got problems.

My junior year of high school,
we lived out of the car.

Wow.

She's better.

But I will never be
that poor again.

Seriously?

What do you think
about these?

Man, you're not the least bit
embarrassed to be shopping here?

Well, I would be, but they're for you.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

Hey, hey, hey.
Style breeds confidence.

Sounds like
a bad commercial.

That's Leo Burnett.
I didn't do that one.

Here, here you go.
Try those on.

What? - Stand still.
What?

What has gotten
into you today?

I gotta admit, you're kinda
freakin' me out, man.

And try smiling, okay? You look like
you stepped in a pile of dog shit

and everyone can smell it.

Seriously, I'm looking for my
friend Sam, maybe you know him.

He's about, oh, yay tall,
he's kind of a dick.

Oh, God.

Come on, stand up straight.
You look like a zombie. Please.

You're crushing my soul.
Here we go.

That's so dramatic!
Hey, how's it going, girls?

Oh, God. - We are not drunk enough
to buy what you're selling.

Wow, hey! Does it look like I'm
trying to sell you something?

Yes. - Yeah. Absolutely.
Pretty much.

No, fair enough.
Listen, I just wanted to see

if you guys were going to
stay for the band.

We have to work early.

No. What do you do?
Teach third grade. - First grade.

Oh, wow, teachin'
on Sundays now, huh?

Um...

Is the band any good? - Well, I like
to think so, but I'm a bit biased.

I'm Sam and that's Quentin. Q.

You're in the band?
Watch it.

That really hurts.
What?

I play guitar.

I'm April.

I'm Lizzie.

April and Lizzie, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna make another round here,

see if I can drum up some more
people to stay for the show.

You keep my friend here
company and we'll play

whatever song you
want to open with.

Any song?
You name it.

<i>Paparazzi.</i>

Lady Gaga.
I know.

Bullshit!
You did not know!

All right,
give me one more chance.

Let's pick up some stuff to make
margaritas. - Good idea.

Can we stop on the way?

Hey, that was awesome.

Oh, good. Thank you.
See you over there, man.

Hey, you need a ride?

No. Imma ride my bike. I'll meet you
over there. - Okay, all right. - Okay.

What kind of car is this?
Is this safe?

Yeah, we can
all ride up front.

Hi. - "Rudderless" rocks!
Yeah!

You just see the show?

You don't remember me,
do you?

Were you sitting at the bar?
I'm Kate Lucas.

We've already met,
in Josh's room.

Oh, my God.

It's been better lately.

Things have died down. I even go
out sometimes, like tonight.

Oh, Kate. - I go by Ann now.
It's my middle name.

So you're a rock
star now, huh?

Except you didn't write
those songs, did you?

Listen... - How could
you play those songs?

Shame on you!

Hey, Sam!

I was not expecting this.

Oh!

Shit. Hey.
I have to stay ahead of it.

Paint thinner's the only thing that...
But it's hell on your hands.

Tequila?

Yeah, I thought it was a good
choice for the occasion.

Happy birthday, Josh.

Happy birthday, Josh.

I think for mothers and daughters,
it's sweet 16.

For fathers and sons, it's 21.

Was I always
such an asshole?

You really grew
into it, though.

Was I always the ice queen?

There were some
notable thaws.

I had breakfast with
one of the moms.

She wanted to talk,
to forgive Josh...

Eh. - She didn't blame us.
It was amazing.

Don't. Don't.
It was like a weight lifting.

I've been thinking about
reaching out to the others.

I'd like you to do it with...
You know what, I should go.

It wasn't our fault. - You think I
don't know it wasn't our fault?

I don't know, Sam. I don't know what
you think! - Hey, are you okay to drive?

We did everything right.

We did everything we could.
Josh was sick.

You might want to dwell on this,
but I don't.

What does it matter?
His fault, your fault, my fault.

Who cares?

I don't need to ask
for anybody's forgiveness.

And I sure as fuck don't need
to meet any of the parents!

<i># Stop staring</i>

<i># Stop staring</i>

Man, you look like shit.

Well, hard to look better
than a man in uniform.

Must have been
one hell of a weekend.

You know, me and Earl caught the Crimson
and Cream game on Saturday.

Sounds like fun.
Nah.

Okay, I'm gonna grab
some more water.

What the hell you doin'?

Well, most people
call it a nap.

In fact, in some cultures it's considered
a real boost to productivity.

You're fired, smart guy.
Well, if it weren't sad,

it'd be kind of endearing that you don't
realize I quit about an hour ago.

Whoo! - I keep trying to get Sam to go.
Oh, he will. On the deck!

Yeah, yeah. He's not into it.
I don't know why. - Damn!

Look at this boat you have, man.
I'm gonna be really disappointed.

Like, terribly upset.
Naw, I'm just kiddin'.

Permission to come aboard?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I know. I mean, seriously,
man, it's that good.

I mean, sooner or later
someone's gonna sign us.

"Real Friends" is a hit. - We do a
regional tour and we're set.

You really think so?

Fuck, yeah, dude. And we're talking
eight to 10 a night. - No way, dude.

Yeah. Thousand? - You're not
making donuts anymore, man.

<i># Don't, don't, don't,

<i># Don't, don't, don't... #</i>

Aiken!

Oh, fuck
What?

I'm not gonna beat around
the bush, or pussy foot.

I think the best thing to do is say it...
Like a Band-Aid. Quick and...

Well, not really painless because
usually that hurts. But what I mean is...

We were asked to play
the BUZZ 104 Block Party.

Look, we've been more
than cool, man.

You only want
to play Saturdays, fine.

You don't want to play other bars,
okay, we can swallow that for now,

but this is big, man. You owe us.
Dude, dude, dude.

Wilco. Death Cab, radio promos.

Do you know what this could mean, dude?
This could be the first step.

I mean, I don't wanna think
about the audience. Yes, I do.

But if Ben Gibbard
digs it, who knows?

Yeah, they want us to play
15 minutes, three songs or so.

You can do this
one thing for us.

Guys, I know I'm dragging,
but it's... complicated.

I should think about it.

There's nothing to think about, man.
We need this, Sam.

I need to think about it.

<i>All right, easy. Stop! There's a pole!
I know there's a pole back there!</i>

I can see the damn pole.
There's a gas thing up there!

Don't tell me what to do, I can drive!
I've been drivin' all my damn life.

Just a little bit, just a little bit.
Stop! - Son of a bitch!

Hey, come on, come on.
Comin' back, comin' back!

You must be Tina.
And you must be Sam.

Who are you talkin' to?
What are you...

Are you help,
are you gonna help me?

Well, that is a big sucker.
Watch it! - Has its own zip code.

Stop!
What? Motherfuckin'...

Let me see if I can...
I wouldn't...

Son of a bitch!
All right.

Man. Did... Did you try...
You're... Can you...

You need to cut it a bit...
Yeah, yeah. Tried that twice.

You know, I'm not too old to whoop
yo' ass if you start laughin', yeah?

I would not think of that.
Did you buy this?

Test drive.

Oh, oh, all right. Oh, yeah, hold on.
Hold on.

Wait a minute.
Go ahead, keep laughing.

So it's funny now.

Go ahead and laugh it up!
Keep laughin', both of you!

Ha-ha-ha! Yeah, as long as I'm
here to amuse you.

I told you so.
Come on, Sam.

Sooner I can get you what you need,
the sooner I'm done with you.

Hey, can I give it a shot?

All right, you get it out
without a scratch,

I'll give you whatever
you came for for free.

Come on, Tina,
don't help him.

I got it! - You did not.
You're full of shit!

Have you got one of these?

I do.

I packed those tubes away.
I know where they are.

Nice to finally meet you, Sam.
And you, too, Tina.

Can I ask you a question?
Mmm.

How come you're not playing
the gig on Saturday?

How do you know about that?
Shit, that's all I do know about.

If Q ain't in here asking me to play
the damn guitar, I got to hear him

runnin' his mouth about how
you ain't playing the gig.

Well, I never said I wasn't going to play
the gig. I said I had to think about it.

What's there to think about?
You're a band. It's a gig.

They're not that easy to come by.
I need to think about it, though.

I'm just... I'm too old
for this shit, man.

Wow.

What you talkin' about,
too old?

T - Bone Walker played till he was 77.
Died with a guitar in his hand.

Well, I don't want to die
with a guitar in my hand.

Then what you
doin' in a band?

Beginning to wonder
that myself.

Hey, Slim!
Hey.

So what's up with that
"for sale" sign in the window?

Yeah, man. Puttin' the
business up for sale.

Me and Tina are gonna do
some traveling. - Oh, really?

Take a look around.
See somethin' you like, let me know.

<i># You're so emotional</i>

<i># You're such a beautiful mess</i>

<i># One thing I really hate</i>

<i># Is when Sam
is really late</i>

<i># Hurry up,
hurry up and wait</i>

<i># Don't be sorry</i>

<i># Let's make
the most of us</i>

<i># Love played a joke on us #
I wanna play this at the block party.</i>

Yes!

The man has spoken.
All right! - No.

<i>I wanna play
"Over Your Shoulder",</i>

<i>- "Real Friends", and close with this.
It's not finished yet. - It's finished.</i>

That's the deal. We close with your song.
When was the meeting where we made

you lord and master of the band?
'Cause I think I missed it.

It's the only way I'll do the show.
It's a good song.

Makes me nervous to agree
with Sam, but he's right.

So it's settled.

Count it off.
Let's do it.

Fine with me, I didn't wanna
play that show anyway.

Ah, come on, Q.

Come on, bro. - Okay, okay, okay.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

All right, fine.
We'll play the fucking song.

It's a good song.

You're such an asshole!

<i># Wake up in
your favorite shoes</i>

<i># Sunsets and afternoons</i>

<i># Make it up
make it up for me</i>

<i># And change the story</i>

<i># Stylishly under-dressed</i>

<i># Unfazed and unimpressed</i>

<i># Carry on, carry on, it's great
You can't ignore me</i>

<i># Don't stop you're good
with what you got</i>

<i># You're so emotional</i>

<i># You're such
a beautiful mess #</i>

Tonight when everyone
is cheering for those songs,

how are you gonna
feel about that?

This whole thing, this fantasy you're
living in, it's... it's impressive.

Kate... - Ann.
It's Ann, remember?

Ann, please. - Do you even know
why I changed my name?

Because they kept calling me.

What kind of sex
did we have?

Did we have a cult?
How many were there?

I had to quit school.
Josh ruined my life.

That's what your son did to me.
I'm so sorry. - Sorry?

Know what?
I should thank you.

I think I'm finally finished
with you and your son.

Is it true?

Yeah.

Today is really not turning out
like I thought it would.

I should have told you.

You think?

Dude, we can still play the show, man.
Think about it. - We're only doing

three songs, one of them's yours.
Yours is the best one. - Guys...

Yeah, I don't know what she
told you... - You need this.

After tonight we stop playing 'em forever,
and we never play 'em again.

No one's the wiser,
but we don't miss this chance.

No one would know.
I would know.

Playing these songs is wrong.

It's wrong.

Isn't it, Sam?

It's wrong.

All right,
I'm gettin' my stuff.

Q, please, man.
Seriously, think about this.

Come on, bro.

Pack up the rest
of my shit, all right?

You screwed us, Sam.

He was...
He was my son.

Yeah, and you must have
been a hell of a father.

Listen.

Shit.

What are you havin'?

Whiskey.
Neat.

Double it up for me, will ya?

Well, fuck you.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, fuck!

Hell, no.

Oh, no, buddy.

Fuck.
Fuck.

Fuck.

What the fuck?

Shut the fuck up!

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>the annual Lake Channing
Summer Regatta is underway!</i>

<i>...beginning at 2:00.
And the silent auction...</i>

Okay, a little to the right!
Nice.

Nice.
Looks great, guys.

Hey.
Do you see that?

That's it.
You hear that?

Hey, check it out!

What the hell
is he doing?

Look! - Bring it around!
Break left! Tag left!

Get away!
God, what is he doing?

Break off!

What a jerk!

You're a jerk!

I'm gonna remember
your face, douche.

What's wrong with you?

What are you doing?

What the hell do
think you're doing?

I'm over here.

I'm sorry it's so late, I...
I didn't have anyone else to call.

You remember the
university shootings

at Smythe Library
a couple of years ago?

Yeah. You talkin'
about your boy, huh?

Oh, yeah, I recognized you when
you first came into the shop.

Just took me a minute
to figure out where from.

Well, then,
you know my story.

No. I don't know your story, man.
All I know is what I read.

What would you say
if I told you that...

my son wrote all the songs
the band plays?

Damn.

I'd say, "I didn't
see that comin'. "

Wait, does Quentin know?
He does now.

Oh, yeah?
How'd he take it?

There ya go.
Well, I can't say as I blame him.

Damn! Your boy wrote
all that music?

Well, what were
you thinking?

He was my son. - They were
all somebody's sons, Sam.

Somebody's sons, somebody's daughters.
Your boy killed them. - I know, but...

but he was my son.

Well, I can't say I know half of
what you've been through, man.

But...
Quentin deserves better.

I know.

My little boy.

My boy, my boy.

My boy.
Oh, my boy.

My boy...

You okay?
No. Not yet.

What are you doin' here?
I...

I think someday, Phillip's gonna wanna
know who his brother really was,

or just what he's
going to read.

And when that happens,
I think you should give him these.

Wait.

Just listen.

Thought you played
that old Epiphone.

Not anymore.

I just wanted
to come by and...

And say thanks.

No need, man.
Not even a little bit.

Okay.

Okay. - Are those Quentin's guitars?
Yeah. Stubborn little bastard.

I told him I'm damn near givin'
things away around here, but,

he won't take no for an answer.
Wants me to sell 'em on consignment.

Thank you.
Yeah.

Oh, I forgot to ask.
How's this goin'?

Got an offer.

That's great.
Yeah.

Well...

You take care of yourself.

Okay.
All right.

A good offer?

Heard the donuts in here
are better than sex.

You're doin' it wrong, then.

Can we talk?
I'm kind of behind here.

Okay. Guess I need to
order something then, huh?

What are those?
Cherry.

That one?

Blueberry fritter.

That first night that we
got up there and played,

it was like I got to meet
a Josh that I never knew.

And every new song we played,
I learned more about him.

It was intoxicating.

I couldn't stop.
I didn't wanna stop, but,

it wasn't Josh.

It was you.

Oh, my God, Quentin.

I am so sorry.

The last thing I ever wanted to do was
fuck up another young man's life.

Is that what you think?

Well, you can let yourself
off the hook for that one.

I've been fuckin' up
my life for 21 years, man.

Then stop.

Stop fucking it up.

Keep going. You don't need those
songs. You don't need me.

I want you to keep going.
I want you to write songs.

I want you to make music.

Don't give up
because of me.

Quitters never win.

"Quitters never win"?

Is that seriously the best you've got?
"Quitters never win"?

I... I...

That's the best I got.

Quitters never win.

Hmm.
