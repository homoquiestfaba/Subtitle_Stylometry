I know that.

And for every 9 stocks that fell,
8 advanced. It's not Black Friday.

Then, go back with that asshole
that talked into going on Enron.

You know what?
Fuck you, too.

Della?

Della, honey?

What?

What's the matter?

What's the matter?

Honey, you want to tell me
what it is you do all day?

What do you mean?
Well...

Honey, look at the goddamn place.

There's kid-shit all over
the place, wall to wall.

We do the best we can.

The best you can? Why don't you
just do what I tell you to do?

Stop.
Tell me. What happened to you?

Stop.
You should put yourself together.

What do you want me
to say? We've got kids.

I don't want you to say anything.
Just to keep the house clean!

God.

Terry got an "A" in math.
Goddamn it, Della!

Don't what?
That's her favorite doll.

What?
You'll have to fix her.

I'll have to what?

You'll have to fix her.
I'll have to what?

You'll have...

That's all you worry about.
The kids.

I'll have to what? Would you look
at me when I'm talking to you?

Stop it!

Why don't you stop it?
Don't tell me what to do!

Stop it.
You understand me?

You understand what I'm saying?

Don't break my arm.

Don't tell me what to do!

Why do you make me
do this every fucking time?

What are we supposed to do now?

I'm out...

of wrapping paper.

It's okay.

Come on, it's okay.

It's okay.
How are you doing?

I want a Nintendo Wii
for Christmas, mom.

It's only a few hours
till Christmas.

Can I get an American Girl doll?
Guys.

You wrote your letters to Santa.

I don't think another letter
will make it to the North Pole.

We're going to be okay?
We're always okay.

We're always okay.

No matter what happens.
No matter what happens.

I'll be back in a while, okay?
Okay.

Now, promise me one thing.
Listen. You, you.

You have to brush your teeth.

And I want you in the bed
after your treat, all right?

I'll see you later.

Mom!

I made a secret drawing for you.

I love your drawings.
Don't look at it yet!

Okay. I'll save it for later.
How about that?

Bye, sweetie.

And you can kiss my ass, Kenneth.

<i>Learning Academy.
Meghan speaking.</i>

Hi, Meghan.
It's Della Myers.

<i>Hi.</i>

<i>Are you calling about Spanish?
It's been cancelled.</i>

I knew about that.

It's about next week's
mechanics class.

Would you pass on to Mike
that I won't be there this time?

<i>No problem.</i>

<i>- I'll make sure he gets that.
Great.</i>

<i>- Hi. Della?
What's up, Cassie?</i>

<i>I'm over at the mall. What is
it we need to get for Pilates?</i>

One of those rubber bands.
I'm headed over there myself.

<i>Do yourself a favor. Turn around.
It's hell over here.</i>

My cell's dying.

You know... damn!

I left the charger
in the other car.

<i>Silly you. Let me pick you up
something. Save you the trip.</i>

<i>- I mean...
Are you sure?</i>

No, it's okay.

Cassie, can we meet for a drink?

<i>You still there?
Your phone is breaking up.</i>

Damn.

You're kidding me.
My God!

Damn it!

Damn!

Come on.

You think you're going
to take my spot, think again!

<i>I've been waiting
for 3o minutes! It's Christmas!</i>

Excuse me. Where can I find a
parking space? This is ridiculous!

Ma'am, there is absolutely
nothing close by.

Even the valet's backed up.

You should try further out.
Where? Over there?

Now, please keep moving.

Let's go.

Go!

Come on!

Jerk!

What a jerk!

Over there.

Smile.

Good girl.

Merry Christmas!

Would you like Chanel No. 5?
No, thank you.

Can I help you with that?

I was just looking.
Thank you.

Hi.

Could I have a hot tea, please?

And one chocolate biscotti.

Milk or dark chocolate?

No, just the tea.

Name?

Della.

Two "L"s.

US$2.65.

Thank you.

Della?

Is that you?

Lynn? Lynn Monroe.

Hi.
I haven't seen you since college!

Right.

You married that handsome jock
and we never heard from you again.

You live around here?

We just bought this divine house
in Pleasant Valley. You know it?

Yes, I do.

It's perfect for the kids.
They practically walk to school.

We've got a great backyard.

We're thinking
of putting a pool in it.

They'll love that!

Enough of me.
How are you?

Fine.

I have two children,
Terry and Tammi. Twins.

We're celebrating tonight.
David's been promoted.

I had to buy this gorgeous
black teddy.

It is. It's gorgeous.

It's been nice talking to you.
You too.

I've got to get my hair done.

See you later.

See you.

Mitch!

How are you?

Which one would you like?
That one.

That one?

This one?

That's the one?

Thanks.
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas!

Hello.

US$21.69, please.

There you go.
Thank you.

I'm sorry.
It's been declined.

Do you have another card?

No, I don't.

Seventeen...

twenty-one...

There.

<i>It's Christmas Eve,
and the mall is now closed.</i>

<i>Happy Holidays, everyone.</i>

<i>This day is borne a Savior
Of a pure, virgin bride</i>

<i>To free all who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might</i>

<i>Oh, tidings of comfort and joy</i>

<i>Oh, tidings</i>

<i>Of comfort and joy</i>

Shit.

Shit. What now?

Excuse me?

I've got a gun.

How's about I aim it
at your pussy?

Why don't you back your car up?

That's not going to happen.

What are you doing?
I don't know this game.

Trust me, it's not a game.

How about you shut up,
and eat a dick?

When you get done, we're going
to staple your mouth shut.

Right, Chuckie?

"Chuckie"? Is that for real?

At least your parents
have a sense of humor.

I don't have any parents.

I named myself.

Do you have a beef
with us, honey?

Because slipping a note
underneath my wipers...

is an invitation to war
to me and my soldiers.

If you hadn't have parked
like an asshole...

we wouldn't be standing here.

Watch your mouth!
Get away from me!

You're just digging
your grave deeper.

Where you going?
Fuck you!

Fuck you.
No, fuck you!

Any trouble here, ma'am?

Not if these punks
move their car!

What's the deal, Barney Fife?

Okay, boys. Back your car up
and let the lady out.

How does that sound, squirt?

We're not in the mood.
In fact...

mind your fucking business,
and go direct some traffic.

I'm going to make
this my business.

Now, why don't you pile back
into your piece-of-shit car...

and get the fuck out of my mall?

Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

Did you hear me, daddy?
Get out of here!

Put the gun down.
Get out of here!

Put the gun down!
I said, get out of here!

Put the gun down!
You want me to put it down?

Make me, bitch!
I said...

Shit.
Motherfucker.

She's getting away!

<i>Fuck, man! She's probably
on the phone with 5-o already!</i>

We're going to go down for this!
Don't worry about it, nigga.

Don't call me "nigga".
You ain't the right. None of you.

Take it easy, Huey.

Take it easy.
We got this.

The world is our bitch.
Get in the car.

Now.

Move over, Tomas!
Come on!

The cop went down hard.
Goddamn it, Tomas. Shut up!

My God.

Oh, God.

Hell, no.

Damn!
What?

My new Keds are all dirty!

Get there and push!

The car's got nowhere to go.
The road ends there.

There's nothing
but houses and trees.

Ditch the car, man.

We've got a witness on the loose.

Trust me.

You won't hear a peep from her.
She's going down, execution style.

What if she's gone already?

She's not gone.

There's no place for her to go.

<i>Damn. She took out that barrier.</i>

<i>It's going to be impossible to
find her, even if she is around.</i>

<i>Come on, guys.</i>

Maybe we can hotwire the truck.

I'll find you now, cunt!

We caught up in this
like it's a soap opera.

We need to blast out of town,
act like we were never around.

Vingh, get over here.
How much "Kill" you been smoking?

Come on, man. No one cares
about a fucking Rent-A-Pig!

He's just collateral damage
to the people at the mall.

She's the only witness!

If we hit the road right now...

w could be miles away
before they find out.

We could be swimming in the
Atlantic, like you promised me.

Huey, come here.

Come here.

Remember how I broke
you out of that home?

I was there for you, right?

You trust me, right?

Right?

All we got to do is find her,
and we're out of here. I promise.

That's it.

There's her Ford!

Somebody tell her mom
to lay out her black dress.

Why? Is she dead?

No, she went through her trunk.

She's here.

She's hiding somewhere.

She left her purse.
It's all in here. Her cell phone.

<i>Where are you?</i>

<i>- Her battery gave out.
We're going to find you!</i>

There she is!

Go that way! That way!

Fuck!

You see her down there?
No, man.

She must have gone around.
She vanished.

Check each one of these houses.

Split up. Spread out!

Della!

We know who you are!

You can't hide, honey.

We're not going to give up
till we find you.

You're trapped, Della.

We're going to find you!

Where's Little Red Riding Hood?

Where was that?
Check the house next door!

Move it!

There she is!

We got you.
You're dead, bitch.

Time to say goodbye.

You hear that?
Do you hear that?

It's the sound of the waves!
Sounds good, right?

Yeah, Chuckie.
It sounds great.

Don't worry.

When we're done with you,
we'll send you back to mister...

You want play nice?
You want to play?

Back off! Hold back!

Give me a minute.

I'm sorry about that.

I'm sorry.

You okay?

Chill out.

You all right?

Settle down!

Settle down!

You all right? Settle down.

You know how we know your name?

You messed up, Della.
You left your purse in the car.

Give me that.

Your photo
doesn't do you justice.

He is right.

You look better in person.
You do.

You look good.

You're not going
to need it anymore.

What's in that box, Della?

What's in the box?

What's in the box, girl?

What's up? You think
she's carrying some cash?

Some jewelry or something?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Maybe she cashed in
her life savings.

Plan on running away?

Start a new life?

That is it, Della?

You got enough scratch
to buy us off?

Open the box.

Open the box!

Open it!
Okay.

Take the box. We're going
to kill her anyway.

I'll open the box.

You know what?

She ain't got nothing.

Let's take that pussy
and get going.

I got her!

Down there!

Look out, Huey!

What the fuck, niggas?
Shut up!

Are you hurt?
I said, shut up!

And don't use the N-word.

You ain't representing.

Huey?

What did you do?
What do you mean?

<i>Stop fucking around.</i>

Huey?

What's up, little brother?
Spare me, God.

Quit fucking around.

Huey?

What's up?

Fuck!

Fuck!

Come on, man.

What the fuck did you do?
Get off him!

I didn't kill him.

You stepped on his face!
Don't touch me!

I didn't kill him! She did.
Get the fuck off!

God! Huey!

I'm going to get that bitch!
You let her go!

You piece of shit!
Where the fuck is she?

Fuck.

<i>Della!</i>

<i>Della!</i>

<i>Della!</i>

<i>I guess you are right
When we talked in the heat</i>

<i>There's no room for the weak
No room for the weak</i>

<i>Where will it end?</i>

<i>Where will it end?</i>

<i>Where will it end?</i>

<i>Where will it end?</i>

<i>This is the room
The start of it all</i>

<i>They're talking to you
I remember it all</i>

<i>I've seen the night
Filled with blood and pain</i>

<i>And the bodies obtained
And the bodies obtained</i>

<i>And the bodies obtained</i>

What are you doing?

It's a tribute.

A gesture.

<i>Where will it end?</i>

That'll wake up every
cop in Podunk county!

It's for him.

It's for Huey.

I didn't mean it, Huey.

What did you say?

What?

I didn't mean to kill him.

Get away from him.
Get the fuck away from him!

Get the fuck away from him!

Get away from him!
Get away! Get away!

Get away!
Fuck you!

<i>I'm going to get you!</i>

Do you hear me, Della?

I'm going to get you!

God.

MOMMY WE LOVE YOU

<i>Della!</i>

<i>Della?</i>

Wait.

It's "Bulgari".

What's "Bulgari"?
It's a perfume, dude.

It smells more
like that No. 5 shit.

"Chanel".
No, it's "Bulgari".

My dad's bitch bathes in it.

It's blood.

It's her blood.

Maybe she's hurt.

This way.

Go, go, go!

<i>Watch out, dude.</i>

<i>Look out!</i>

Damn!

Shit!
What happened?

I stepped in the stream!

That was raw.
Who cares, man?

Nobody gives a shit
if we live or die.

Quit playing with the flashlight.
We are stumbling in the dark!

He who finds it, shines it.

Let's go!
Where the hell is she?

Shut up and move it!
Damn!

Let's go, guys.

There she is!

Don't let her get away!

Huey?

Is that you, Huey?

I saw him there in those trees!

Sure you did.

Son of a bitch!

I'm going to get you, bitch!

You will see!

You fucking bitch!

Son of a bitch!

Time's up, you bitch.

God!

Tomas!

Quiet.

Tomas is gone.

I can feel it.

He's probably got her
strung up by now.

There's something over here.

Looks like a body.

It's a tree stump,
you dumb wonton.

Tomas...

She's going to kill us too.

We're all going to die here.

No gun can kill
a spirit gone bad.

She's gone bad.
She's gone bad.

Gone bad.

I'm going to get this girl.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Where are you, God?
Where are you?

All I want to do
is see my babies!

Where are you?
Where are you?

Fuck.

Fuck, fuck!

Over there, Chuckie!

You're going down!

Slow down, bitch.

Fuck.
Get of my way, Vingh!

Get up!

Get up! She's taking off!

I don't feel good, Chuckie.
I got hypothermia.

You'll be fine.

It ain't natural how
she gets away every time.

Let's get this over with.

You go up there.
I'll cover you.

I ain't going there without
the gun. End of story.

I never pegged you for a pussy.

Even when Tomas called it,
I always defended you.

<i>No one ever called me a pussy.</i>

<i>She couldn't weight more than 12o.
You could break her in half</i>

Tomas never called me a pussy!
Fine.

You don't want to go? Don't go.

I'm going to get this bitch
for Tomas. For Huey.

You go up.

I'm going to go around the side.

No limits on power.

No limits on power!

<i>Vingh?</i>

Della?

Della?

<i>It's just you and me left now.</i>

I saw a trail
of your blood back there.

You must be hurt.

I'm hurting, too.

<i>You busted my collarbone.</i>

<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

I can smell your sweat.

I can smell your blood.

I know you're close.

After what went down tonight,
we got a special bond.

You may come out now.

<i>Want a cigarette?</i>

<i>I'll save one for you,
for when you decide to come out.</i>

<i>You are one tough bitch!</i>

And that is hot.

They are really cute.
Twins, huh?

<i>A woman's purse can
tell her whole life story.</i>

Are you sure you don't want
a cigarette now? Della?

Honey?

Now I know where they live.
Maybe I'll stop by and say hi.

I figured that'd help
to find your voice.

Don't worry.

I wouldn't hurt them.

It's wrong to hurt kids, right?

The game's over, Della.

You won.

You took him from me, Della.

He was like my little brother.

All he wanted to do
was see the ocean.

But he never got to see it.

No, he never got to go.

They're all gone now.

Let's see here.

Monday, Pilates.

Tuesday, Spanish.

Wednesday, Mechanics?

Thursday, Friday...

Face it, Della.

You're no suburban housewife.

You bought into the big lie.

You even tried to live it.

Husband...

house...

security...

every woman's dream.

But not yours.

You know there's no
such thing as security.

I reckon I know what
you've been dreaming about.

What you've been aching for...

all these lonely years.

The wind in your hair.

The dirt of life
between your fingers.

Taking what you want from life.

Right, Della?

Don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

It's in your blood.

I bet your husband
doesn't treat you right.

Takes you for granted.

You can't go back to that.

You don't want
to go back to that.

Let's go pick up your kids.

Right now.

And we'll get rid of him.

You can do it.

I can do it.

It's okay.

Come here.

Hell of a night, huh?

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

You're amazing, Della.

So beautiful.

You've been a bad girl.

You're a bad girl.

Fuck me.

Fuck me.

<i>You can count on me</i>

<i>Please have snow and mistletoe</i>

<i>And presents under the tree</i>

<i>Christmas Eve will find me</i>

<i>Where the love light gleams</i>

<i>I'll be home for Christmas</i>

<i>If only in my</i>

<i>Dreams</i>

<i>You want to tell me where
you've been all night, honey?</i>

Don't ever call me that again.

What?

<i>You can't even take
your shoes off at the door?</i>

<i>The Japanese do it!</i>

<i>I do it.</i>

I see you got the paper.
What'd you get me?

What did you get me at the mall?

Nothing.

<i>In every dream home
A heartache</i>

<i>And every step I take</i>

<i>Takes me further from heaven</i>

<i>Is there a heaven?</i>

<i>I'd like to think so</i>

<i>Standards of living</i>

<i>They're rising daily</i>

<i>But home, oh, sweet home</i>

<i>It's only a saying</i>

<i>From bell-push to faucet</i>

<i>In smart-town apartments</i>

<i>The cottage is pretty</i>

<i>The main house a palace</i>

<i>Penthouse perfection
But what goes on?</i>

<i>What to do there?</i>

<i>Better pray there</i>

<i>Open-plan living</i>

<i>Bungalow ranch-style</i>

<i>All of its comforts</i>

<i>Seem so essential</i>

<i>I bought you mail order</i>

<i>My plain-wrapper baby</i>

<i>Your skin is like vinyl</i>

<i>The perfect companion</i>

<i>You float in my new pool</i>

<i>Deluxe and delightful</i>

<i>Inflatable doll</i>

<i>My role is to serve you</i>

<i>Disposable darling</i>

<i>Can't throw you away now</i>

<i>Immortal and life-size</i>

<i>My breath is inside you</i>

<i>I'll dress you up daily</i>

<i>And keep you till death sighs</i>

<i>Inflatable doll</i>

<i>Lover ungrateful</i>

<i>I blew up your body</i>

<i>But you blew my mind</i>

<i>Oh, honey</i>
