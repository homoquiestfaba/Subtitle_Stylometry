''Good evening.
Good evening, sir''

''l'm sorry, you can't go in.
Why not?''

''Only couples are allowed, sir.
But l have the invite''

''Sir, the invite clearly
says: ''Only for couples''

l'm very sorry

''Look, l've returned to
lndia after 5 years''

You must let me inside.. c'mon

''l'm sorry, sir''

''But those girls are being let in?
The club has a policy, sir.''

Single girls are allowed. Single
men are not allowed.

Let me in buddy. lt will take
me a minute to get a partner

''l'm sorry, sir''

l've been very politely
requesting you to let me in

lt's no big deal! You
first invite people..

''and when they get here,
you insult them!''

''This is not done! No, no, no..''

Hey.. there you go!

Couldn't you have waited
a little longer?

He's with me.

ls Tony around? Mr Tony will
be here any moment. Please.

Shall we..?
Sure!

''Wow, thanks! You are..?
You don't know me''

But l heard everything out there

''l thought l ought to help, since
you've returned after so many years''

''l like helping people in trouble,
you know.. The helpful sort ?''

Hey! So why don't you
help me a little more?

''Have a drink with me, really''

l do have limits to being helpful

You'll have to find someone
else to have a drink with

''There's someone waiting for me.
By the way, l'm Nikhil Kapoor''

Hi Nikhil.
At least tell me your name

Oh this accursed love

it means the world to me

''Now its here, now its gone..''

''But as long as it is here,
its like glimpsing paradise''

Looks like he can't take
his eyes off you!

But he's hot.. don't you think ?

Poor Farhad!

Cute butt.. what do you say?

Guys and girls! Give a big hand
to the next singer of the night..

Nikhil Kapoor! All
the way from Boston!

Let's see if he has actually learnt
something at the business school!

''Thank you, thank you everyone''

''lf l'm here today, it's all
thanks to this beautiful girl''

''lf not for her, l might still
have been languishing outside.''

And l dedicate this song
to that beautiful girl..

who has flatly refused
to tell me her name

lf she indeed cares for me..

she'll surely join me

Pretty Woman..

don't break my heart

You who have stolen my heart..

''Don't shy away from me,''

Having changed my life.

Oh my God.

''l hope you will never
change, my love''

What's love if not
a misdeamenour..?

''a sweet poison, a suffering..?''

''an obsession, a high..?''

an aching suppressed in the heart?

''Come, let's sway..''

let's forget about the
travails of love..

let's give ourselves
up to be shattered..

come..

''Come, let's sway..''

let's forget about the
travails of love..

let's give ourselves
up to be shattered..

come..

come unto me..

''for a moment, only a fleeting
moment, is this wonderful light..''

''for a moment, only a fleeting
moment, is this life of ours''

So let's make the best of it..

let's care not for the world..

let's do what the occasion demands

''Come, forget who you are..''

''let's waltz, matching each
other step for step..''

seeking refuge in this
beautiful night..

''oh, join me, please''

''Come, help me drive away
my loneliness..''

let's make the best of what
Spring has to offer..

let me be drunk on your beauty..

come..

''come to me, please''

Thanks

''Hey.. take a picture, please.
Okay''

''No, no, no.. thank you''

Thanks

You dance well.
l was inspired

Are you trying to charm me..?

Thanks for the dance

''Hey.. ready to leave?
You go, babes..''

l'll join you a little later.
Okay

l'm sure you can stay on too..?
Oh.. no

''May l ask you your name? No, no..''

may l ask you your name
all over again?

''Sure, you may.
Ooh l love her..''

That's not being fair!

Did l ever mention anything
about being fair..?

''Helpful, yes. Fair? Hmm..?''

''Okay, so.. then, will you please
help me with your name?''

l told you. l'm undoubtedly
helpful..

but l have my limits

Listen.. will you tell me your
name the next time we meet?

''Oh sure, absolutely''

We're bound to run into each other
in this small city anyway

''When you truly desire something,
you are sometimes granted your wish''

Really?

So let's find out how
true your desire is!

''Hey.. what's up, bro?''

Hey! Rahul!

Nikhil!

How did you get here?
By Air lndia

''Well, well.. you and
your sense of humour!''

''l mean, when, where, how..?''

Last night. l thought
l'd surprise you

Where else could l catch
you on Sunday but BBC?

The good ol' basketball court

''ln fact, l kept trying your
number all of last night''

But it was unreachable.
What was l doing last night..?

Seem to have a memory lapse water?

Memory lapse! Been naughty eh!

How long do you plan to be
away from your U.S. of A ?

For.. ever

''Don't tell me!
At least, l hope so''

l'm working for lnfo lnternational.
l hope it works out

America seems to have
been good to you

Look at those muscles! Good ya..
Thanks

''lf it wasn't for the colour of your
hair, l'd have complimented you too''

Why? You can too fake
a compliment like me!

To lose both of them at one
go.. must've been hell

Suddenly l was an orphan

But maybe it was best
that they died together

''Everything here has changed,
hasn't it?''

But it's good to be back

''Why don't you move in with me?
No, thanks''

The company's paying for my stay.

So.. what else has been
happening in your life?

As if l'd have asked you
to move in with me..

if there was something
happening in my life

''Anyway, all interesting women
seem to be with idiotic guys!''

''Hey, l forgot to tell you, l met
this wonderful babe last night''

''lf you see her, you won't be able
to take your eyes off her''

What's the name of this
wonderful babe of yours?

Well.. l'll let you
know as soon as

l got to know her name
and whereabouts

What a place!

''Know what, Manoj?''

There used to be a rocking club
in this very hotel earlier

How l wish l had a small flat here

Here..? By the sea?

Your electronic gadgets
would stop working.

''Air conditioners, TV, fridge..''

''Sweetheart, if l had the money to
buy a flat here.. then l would have''

''enough money to keep changing my
AC, TV, Car, fridge every month.''

Now what are these?
The plans for the ground floor

Show me the plans for
the bowling alley first

''Deepak, fetch the bowling-alley
plans, will you?''

Ginger tea for you.
Thank you

When are the soil reports of
the Versova site arriving?

By tomorrow afternoon.
l see

Oh! Mr Farhad!
Mr Farhad..?

Hi sweetheart!

How did your trip go?

l'm actually bored making these
trips to Switzerland all alone

lf only someone came along..
Why don't you take Kabir along?

He's been dying to go to Switzerland

Kabir.. no way!

l'm told you guys have been
partying away merrily.. without me?

So All lndia Radio has
been tattling on us..?

Absolutely

Farhad.. l was about to call you up

l can't go out for lunch today.
Anamika.. not again!

Tell me something.. why do you
always ditch me at the last moment?

''Besides, why do you need
to work on a Sunday?''

''Okay, l'll tell you what''

''To make up for this, l'll cook a
fantastic dinner for you. Promise!''

''Madam, the plans for the penthouse''

''Well then, Anamika..
l'll make a move now''

See you.
See ya

C'mon!

''What's up, Mr Casanova..?''

Looks like your magic hasn't
worked this time?

lt's only been ten days..
she's acting a bit pricey

''You mean to say, she didn't
find you irresistible?''

lt's the first time such a
thing has happened to me

l just can't get her out of my mind

l wonder if l've finally
fallen in love

''l'm serious.
She must be something, man!''

You'd never understand. You
bloody boring businessman!

Yeah..?

Hey Steve!

''l'm sorry.
Late again, huh?''

The old man's making me slog really
hard. - You always have an excuse..

Cut down on your booze buddy.

''Meet Nikhil, my friend from Doon.
Steve.. the big shot builder''

My dad's the big shot builder. Not me

''l've heard so much about you.
Me too, about you''

How's Mumbai treating you?
Great

''Actually, not so great. Join us?''

The gentleman has fallen
in love.. true love

Shut up and shoot..

Hey.. why get into that mess?
Take it from me..

love is delusion. Women
invite trouble!

l don't know what Rahul has told
you about me.. but l'm not into guys

Hey guys.. let's go out tonight

''No, not tonight.
Why not?''

Got to go to the German consulate
tonight.. you'll have to excuse us

''Oh, it had slipped my mind''

Will you pick me up from home?

l'll pick you up at eight. Be ready

l guess l'll go out alone

Babes.. call up Anticlock

Hi Tony!

''How're you? Sounds like the place
is rocking tonight, huh?''

So has the Boston dude been coming?

Yes!

''Been busy, you know''

We'll drop by in a couple
of days. So long..

''yeah, thanks, good night''

So he's still at it! Not the
types to give up easily

''Anamika, for all you know, he's
there with someone else''

No.. no!

We ought to take Farhad
there. What say?

Farhad..? Are you crazy?

He thinks he owns you

He'll kick up a fuss
if he goes there

C'mon.. just think of it.
lt'll be so much of fun

Anamika! You'll get into serious
trouble some day..

''Oh, whatever..
l'm telling you''

Look at these jokers! Hello!

''Move it, guys!''

''What's happening, losers!''

Steve.. are you okay?

Have some water

Are you all right?

l'm fine

What's gotten into you nowadays?
You always seem to be upset

l'm okay now..
You drank so much again..

''Skip the lecture, please! My
dad does enough of it anyway''

l had a few more than l could
handle at a party..

''so what's your problem?
l have no problem, my car does''

''Okay, l'll clean it up tomorrow''

And l'll never ask you for
a ride again.. happy?

lf you are through with your
dramatics.. can we leave?

l know lra's having an affair

The thought is driving me crazy

She doesn't even let me touch her

You know she has a problem
with your drinking

lf l stop drinking she'll find
some other problem with me.

You're okay? You're sure you'll
manage? - Yeah.. l'm fine

l'm sorry about this evening.
You know l love you..

We can discuss that in the morning.
l'm terribly sleepy

''Steve, l'm sleepy''

''You're my wife. Damn it!
Please, Steve''

''What's your problem with me?
You're hurting me, Steve!''

Bitch!

You.. you are drunk!

So?
Steve! Please!

''Why do you hate me so much, lra?
Can't you see what it has done to me?''

lt doesn't make sense for
us to live together anymore

''Don't say that, lra.. you
know how much l love you''

The first time you hit me..

something died inside me.

l can't take this anymore

Let me go. Please.. let me go

lf you leave me.. l'll kill myself

Please don't leave me

''Stop it, Steve.. stop it''

Stop it.. please! Stop it

Can't we give it another chance?

We have been happy together.
Haven't we?

You've been happy too

You know that

''l.. l don't love you anymore, Steve''

All l feel for you now is pity

Who is he?

Same old story of insecurities

''Unsuccessful career, dominating
father, a beautiful wife..''

she was a Miss lndia. She
gave up everything for him

Have you tried talking to Steve?
lt's no good

There he is

Oh shit.. looks like he's had
another fight with his wife

Does his wife beat him up?

Very funny

Hi..
ls everything fine?

What happened?
l don't want to discuss this

''Everything's okay, l hope?
l told you, Rahul''

l don't want to talk about it

l think the two of you ought to
consult a marriage counselor

That's for us to decide. Okay?

Nikhil..
Hey Steve

How're you doing?

What happened to your forehead?
Nothing

My wife has her own unique
way of expressing love

That's scary!
How was it with you last night?

Any luck? - l've gotten used
to the idea of waiting

The manager's become a friend and
the guy who stopped me outside..

has invited me over to dinner
tomorrow. Just my luck!

Let's all go there today

''For all you know, l might
change your fortunes?''

Great!

Did you have to pick up
a fight with Remo now?

''Forget it, will you? Today's
Valentine's Day''

''l'm sure l'll find someone.
Good evening, Ma'am''

Mr Tony asked me to tell you that
your friend is here tonight

Now who is this friend..?

Shall we..?
We shall

Well.. what's going on?

That's Anamika's latest fan.
Anu.. what rubbish is that?

Have you invited someone else here?
You know she's kidding! Let's go

l can barely see.. l've had
too much to drink again

Rubbish! You look absolutely
sober to me

Another drink.
No!

''No, no, no! Stop it, Steve! lt's
my car you always mess up!''

Look!
What?

There she is!

She's indeed..

''Hey, hang on.. She's mine''

Doesn't look like it!

Who's that?

Looks like your girlfriend has
brought her Valentine along

Excuse me..

Hi.
Oh hi!

''Didn't l tell you? When you truly
desire something, you sometimes get it''

''Meet my friend, Farhad.
This is Nikhil Kapoor''

Hi.
Hi

You forgot to mention one name

Nice try!

How much longer will you
make me wait? - Wait..?

''What's he talking about, Anamika?''

Anamika? (the nameless one)

No wonder it took me so long
to get to know your name

''Oh, whatever.
Join me for a drink?''

No thanks. We are with
friends. Let's go

May l have the pleasure of
dancing with you tonight?

''No.. no, not today. Some other time''

Maybe later tonight?
Anu.. excuse us

l've waited so many days to meet you

Just a dance.. please?

''Hey.. chill out, dude''

Looks like you've got it all
wrong. Anu's here with me

''Farhad, he's only asking
me for a dance''

How could you..? You've
come here with me!

So..? God! You men!

''Anamika, please don't get upset.
You can always ask him to leave''

What did you say..?
Why're you butting in?

''Get going, will you?
Didn't you hear me?''

Don't you bloody interfere!
What are you going to do? What?

''What the hell is going on, guys?
l'm just going home!''

Where are you going Anu? He's
the one who should leave.

''Why're you leaving?
Leave me alone, Farhad''

''You heard her.. leave her alone.
Just shut up, okay?''

''Guys, just stop it! l'm going
home! Enough is enough!''

Anu! You're going nowhere!
You're staying right here!

Who d'you think you're yelling at?

Who're you yelling at?
Don't touch me

What are you going to do?

l told you to keep
your hands off me!

Didn't l tell you not to touch me?
Didn't l? You wouldn't bloody listen!

''Farhad, just stop it..
Shut up!''

l told you not to touch me..

Leave me!

Whom do you think you were pointing
the gun at? You dare..

Stop it!

Leave me..
Get out of here!

Just leave me!

''You think you're a stud, eh?''

You pick up a fight
with a cop's son?

No.. please.. don't hit me!

l'll be a bit late today

The accused faces charges
of attempted murder..

illegal possession of arms and unruly
behaviour in the police lock up

The accused's bail plea is rejected

The accused will be held in police
custody till the next hearing

Go on

''No, not here.. go there''

What are you looking at?
l don't dig pansies

''Since when, Chandu-bhai?''

Well? What have you done?
Rape? Murder?

Did you steal a car or rob a bank?

Have you done something

or was it your love for
us that brought you here?

There was a fight in a pub

The gun went off accidentally

Wow! Come here..

come on.. l really fancy
the pub-going types. C'mon!

Sit down

l'm Swamy

You?

Nikhil Kapoor

Dammit! You've even
got a fancy name!

''The Kapoor's are into the
movies, aren't they?''

You must have underworld
connections then..?

''Just kidding. You got a
Gandhi on you, l hope?''

Gandhi..?
Gandhi. 500-rupee notes

You got to have them to stay here

l don't want to stay here.
l want to get out

As if we want to stay here forever!

There's a lot of waiting
here. Take a look..

l've been here for five
years. Killed my wife

Haven't been sentenced
yet. Still waiting

Just lie back quietly
and enjoy yourself

Leave me alone!

What's going on in here?

lt's him..
Did l ask you?

''Jerk, you start throwing your
weight around the moment you arrive?''

''But l've done nothing!
Shut up, asshole!''

A couple of days in solitary
confinement will straighten you out

Hey.. don't you scream

Look after Chandu-bhai and
you'll be taken care of..

is that understood?

Hi Nikhil.. how are you?

Okay. Any good news?
When's the hearing?

The court has put off your
hearing to a later date

Farhad's father has
sent him to Australia

Meet Rahul and ask him
to state in court..

that whatever happened that
day was just an accident

But he's not even willing to meet me

''ln any case, Rahul is in no state
to attend the court right now''

Give me your phone

Rahul..?

''l'm sorry, Rahul. l'm very sorry..''

''you know, l didn't do anything
deliberately..''

''Rahul, l need your help''

lf you don't come to the court..

Rahul..?

Your bail application
has been rejected again

The police claim that you
get into brawls in the jail

Can you get my cell changed?

''That won't be easy, Nikhil''

Farhad's dad is a top cop

l'll need a lot of money
to arrange everything

Ask my uncle to see me

l'll talk to him

l need some money too

''Pankaj, do something.
Please do something''

''Know what, Swamy? Sometimes l
think l'm forgetting everything''

''What it is like to have a decent
meal, sleep on a comfortable bed..''

to see a good looking woman

That's the beauty of jail life

''You gradually forget everything.
The good things, the bad things''

But l can never forget her.
You love her a lot?

l've survived for one year
just thinking of her.

l don't even mind solitary
confinement anymore

''l just lie there, thinking of her''

She hasn't even come
once to meet you

''Come here, Swamy? To a jail?''

lt was nothing short of magic..

that moment when we set
eyes on each other

''l've got to get out of here, Swamy.
She must be waiting for me''

What obsession is this..

you are the one l think
of every moment

What obsession is this..

you are the one l think
of every moment

To you l owe my breath..

for you are my very life

Lonely are my nights without you..

my days are sheer torture..

''lf you wish from by heart,
you will get it.''

Come to me now..

for l wish not to live
without you anymore

l know how l have lived
without you..

only l know how l have lived

How have l lived without you..

''Oh, what life without you..''

How have l lived without you..

''Oh, what life without you..''

How have l lived without you..

''Oh, what life without you..''

Hey..

the officer has sent
for you. Hurry up

Move it!

Since when have you been
working for this NGO?

''Nikhil, meet Mrs Malhotra.
She works with an NGO..''

and wants to ask you some questions
about your case.. sit down

Hello Nikhil.. sit down

''Nikhil Kapoor, MBA, Boston
University. Right?''

''February 14, 2003. You and Farhad
were arrested for brawling''

A pistol was recovered from you

You are accused of
firing at Rahul..

you even used force on Anamika.

Can l have a word with him alone?

Sure

''Nikhil, l will try to help you..''

but you'll have to cooperate with me

Why do you want to help me?

Because it's my job to help
under-trial prisoners like you

Can you get me out of here?

l can surely give it a try

What do you want to know?

You can't even imagine
what jail food is like

l can

Any idea where Anamika
and Rahul are?

And Steve? He was there too.
He saw everything

Remember Nikhil.. you're
only out on bail

Don't do something that lands
you in trouble again

''l'll have to find Anamika,
whatever happens''

''Have you thought of what you're
going to do, or where you'll stay?''

l can't go to my Uncle. l could
sense it from his tone

l had called him up to tell
him about my release..

l'll manage something.
There's this home for the aged

You could work there as
a volunteer for some days

lt'll provide you a place to stay

Come

Good evening everybody

How're you feeling?

''Good evening, Mrs Sharma''

Hey.. come on in.. come.
lt's just like home..

Hi lra..
Hello Mrs Fernandes

Whose cards are you reading today?
My own!

l'm going to land something
special today

''Really? Mrs Fernandes,
meet my friend. Nikhil''

Hello young man..
Hello Mrs Fernandes

Nikhil will be staying
here for a few days

''Oh! So you're my ''something
special''?''

The other oldies are all going
to be jealous of me now!

Hey Tony.. very good!

''Well played, guys''

Hi Rahul

Rahul..

l had no clue..

Have you ever thought
of anyone but yourself?

l tried my best to contact
you. You know that

''lt was an accident, Rahul. l'm sorry''

''Go away, Nikhil''

Don't say that. l'm
a friend of yours

''You know, l'd never even
dream of harming you''

l've been rotting in
prison for 3 years

3 years? l'll have to spend
a lifetime in this wheelchair

l know you didn't fire
at me deliberately

But you were responsible
for whatever happened

Please Nikhil.. don't ever
try to meet me again

Rahul.. any idea where Anamika is?

Hi..
Hi

What's up? You look upset

l met Rahul

Because of me..

''Nikhil, what happened was an
accident. lt wasn't your fault''

Maybe it was my fault too

l'm sorry.. water?

''Yeah, sure''

''l got some stuff for you. On my
way back, my car broke down''

''lmagine, just five minutes away''

You ought to have phoned me.
l'd have carried all this

''No, it's okay.. thanks''

lra.. all this stuff..?

''Nikhil, how do you find it here?''

You've gotten to be great
friends with Mrs Fernandes.

She's very sweet. lra..
so much of stuff..

what is this?
You like it?

''Yeah, l like it. Thank you''

l thought l'd atleast
make your room liveable

''Liveable? Don't forget, l've
spent 3 years in jail''

Can l thank you by taking you
out to dinner? Please..?

Hi

Why're you sitting in the dark?

Just like that.
Oh my God..

the traffic was a killer as usual!

But guess what? Our lTC
presentation was simply superb

We'll definitely bag the contract..

''and maybe l'll get another
promotion. - Damn good, Anu''

l know. We can then go to
Spain for our honeymoon

l met Sunita over lunch today

We've even decided on a menu for
our engagement. How about that?

Why do you leave me out of
everything? - My sweety..

l don't want to bother
you with small details

But it happens to be
my engagement too

Why must you say such things?

l'm sorry

Remember..? lt's exactly
3 years since we met?

Remember Nikhil?

How can l ever forget him?

''You liked him, didn't you?''

What kind of a question is that?

All women used to
find him attractive

Well! At least he used to think so!

But why talk about him?

Let's go out to dinner somewhere

''l'm terribly tired, Anu.
Okay..''

''in that case, let's order
something at home. Pizza?''

l'm not hungry at all. Seriously.

''Don't be a spoilsport now!
No, seriously.. l'm very sleepy''

l'll go to sleep

Well.. l guess l'm
going to be off then

''Okay.. thanks, Nikhil.
You're welcome''

l'm sorry we got so late. l had
no idea it would be so crowded

''Actually, l had forgotten
that it's Valentine's Day''

See you tomorrow.
See you

Bye.
Bye.. good night

You.. weren't you supposed
to be back tomorrow?

l thought l'd give you a surprise

But..

had a nice evening?

l'm talking to you!

Maybe you haven't noticed

l've been waiting to
have dinner with you

Who was it?

''What difference does it make, Steve?''

''You who have stolen my heart..''

''Don't shy away from me,''''

''Having changed my life.''

Hi babes! What's up? Partying?

''No, l'm at home.
What!''

You're at home on Valentine's Day?
What's the matter with you?

That's just what l wanted
to talk to you about

''ln other words, you've given
number 13 the royal ditch!''

''No babes, this is serious''

l think.. l'm falling in love

What?! l'm coming right over!
Bye for now.. bye

Anamika?

Nikhil?

Weren't you in jail?

l've been granted bail

How are you?

l've been looking for you

''And l thought, where else could
l find you, but here..''

''this place, where we had first met''

l suddenly feel as if the last
3 years didn't happen at all..

as if we've just met

How have you been?

l'm good

l got to be going.
Please wait..

l've waited for this moment
for 3 long years

So please don't talk of leaving

l thought of you every moment
l spent in jail..

Nikhil..

everything has changed..
Nothing has changed

''Else, you wouldn't have
been here today''

l..

''l'm in love with Rahul, Nikhil''

What!

We're getting engaged on
the 24th of this month

You must be joking

''That one shot you fired changed
everything, Nikhil''

Anamika..?
Hi

''Hi. Mom, Dad.. that's Anamika''

''Come, dear. Sit down''

''Actually, l wanted to come
much earlier. But..''

What a pleasant surprise

l didn't think you'd come at all

''Rahul, for whatever has happened..''

l.. l just wanted to say sorry

l always told you to
stay away from Nikhil

Please.. c'mon

l'll be going home next week

May l come..? To take you home?

You don't have to bother.
Mom and Dad are here

Would you mind.. if l came?

''You know, Anamika.. it'll be difficult
to live with so much of pity''

l'm not pitying you-

l hold myself equally responsible
for whatever has happened. And so..

l've been trying to
say that l'm sorry

But looks like l haven't been
able to say it properly

''Thursday morning, ten o'clock.''

l took Rahul home. l used
to go to meet him sometimes

l had started liking him

And then one day..

we were in love

l met Rahul this afternoon

He didn't say a word to me

This afternoon..?

Anamika..

l won't be able to live without you

Nikhil..

You actually pity him

And you're mistaking
that pity for love

Anamika..

Anamika..

''Wow! Old songs were so great,
weren't they?''

''What lyrics, what tunes.. - What's
the problem with today's lyrics?''

Kick up a fuss.. my heart
goes ding-dong..

''Sure, tell me about it.
Ding-dong indeed''

l have some nice wine
imported

Wine? No thank you

Pamper me so much
and l'll become fat

Become..? What do you think
you are right now?

Excuse me! Do you mean l'm fat?

And what do you have to
say about yourself?

Lazy bum! You sit in that
chair all day and..

''l'm sorry, that's not what l meant''

You did

You know l didn't mean it

''And you're right too. l'm getting
fat, sitting around all day''

Rahul..

''Rahul, l..''

oh my God!

All this..?

lt's this lazy bum who has
done all this for you

''l can't believe this. All
this, on your own..?''

Can't be helped! Some
people are so stingy..

they don't give their friends
a treat even on their birthdays

Happy birthday

Have l done something wrong..?

So.. why're you crying?

Because l'm happy.
What?

Because l'm happy !

Looks like we'll have to celebrate
your birthday again next month

C'mon..

stop crying..

and give me that gorgeous smile

Love now smiles..

''in you, l have found
a new lease of life''

l lived in the shadows..

l led a lifeless existence
until l met you

Romance smiles..

''in you, l have found life''

l lived in the shadows..

l led a lifeless existence
until l met you

There were things l couldn't
dare imagine..

''and now, they're all l dream of''

Why mustn't my heart crave then?

''Why mustn't it pine,
thirst for you?''

''Why mustn't it pine,
thirst for you?''

Little did l know..

that my prayers would bear fruit

That such a thing would
ever be possible..

l'd have you face to face with me

Look in my eyes..

you'll see just how
crazy l am about you

''Why does the heart crave,
yearn, ache for you?''

''Why does the heart crave,
yearn, ache for you?''

Rahul..?

Did you meet Nikhil today?

ls that why you asked me all those
strange questions this evening?

Meeting Nikhil today..

drove me a bit crazy. l'm sorry

l met Nikhil at Anticlock today

What were you doing there?

l..

''l was on my to Sunita's place, Rahul''

As l drove past Anticlock..

''l don't know why, but l just
walked in to take a look''

But isn't the place
shut for repairs?

''l know, Rahul. l don't know why,
but it just slipped my mind''

Sunita and l used to hang
out there a lot earlier

lsn't that also where
you first met Nikhil?

You used to like him a lot too

l see! So this is what
you are so upset about!

''lt's hardly your fault, Anamika''

''After all, l can't even
make love to you''

''Don't talk nonsense, Rahul! Please!''

Be honest with me. Didn't
you really like him?

What's wrong with you..?
You're being mean!

Tell me something

why do you love me so much?

Can you tell me why
you love me so much?

lt was difficult for me
to meet Nikhil today

''And instead of understanding
that, you're..''

do you love me at all?

''Sir, phone for you.
Who is it?''

Anu didi

Hi

The flowers are beautiful. Thanks

Flowers? What flowers?

The ones you sent me

''l sent no flowers, Anu''

Someone else must have

Maybe it was a mistake then..

there's someone at the door. Maybe
to take the flowers back

l'll call you later

''Forgive me for the intrusion,
but please do not be so upset''

You look nicer when you smile

Hi..
Hi.. come

''What happened, lra? All well? You
didn't come to the home today''

There's been a slight problem

My husband saw you dropping me home

He.. he thinks..

he's got it all wrong

l could talk to him

No. You don't know him..
he's a bit unstable

He could do anything

''May l ask you something, lra?
l hope you don't mind''

Why are you with him? Why
don't you leave him?

''l gave up everything for him.
My career, my family..''

we used to love each other so much

And then
what happened? - l don't know

''Our lives are pretty complicated,
aren't they?''

We'll look for a new place
for you tomorrow

''Till then, l'll come there
only once in a while''

Gotta leave now. Bye

''No.. stay right here.
And be careful, please''

l thought you didn't ever
want to meet me again

Why're you bothering Anamika?

''When l first saw you in the
wheelchair, l felt very bad''

But not anymore

Anamika means everything to me

You knew how much l loved her

And you knew there was nothing
between the two of you either

And now.. Anamika and
l love each other a lot

''lf you really loved her,
you'd have gone away''

But you've found yourself a
pretty nurse for a lifetime

Oh yes.. do tell Anu that she's
looking very beautiful today

Hello chef!
Hi

Where's Narayan today?
He had something to do in Colaba

He hasn't returned yet

''l felt hungry, so l thought l'd..''

You ought to have told me. l'd have
picked up something on my way

''l can't spend my life
waiting for you, can l?''

Why're you angry with me?

Nikhil was right

You're really looking
beautiful today

So you met him again?

Rahul.. are you okay?

''Just leave me alone, okay? Please''

l don't know what happens to me.

''What have l done, Rahul?''

l'm sorry

See what happens to me
when you're not around

You still can't bring
yourself to trust me

That's not true! lt's just that..

l can't stop myself from thinking
about Nikhil and you

Are you sure you want to marry
someone who's lusting after Nikhil?

Hello..

hello?

Hello!

Nikhil..?

ls it hurting a lot?

What?

Your foot.. does it hurt a lot?

How.. how do you know?

l've decided to move to Dehradun

What will you do there?

l have a friend there who has
got me a job in a school

You need any help from me?
Thanks

l've found a place for you.
lt's a bit far away..

but it'll do for now. You
can move in tomorrow

''Thank you, lra. You've really
done so much for me''

l'm really indebted to you

l wish l could go away
someplace like you

But my life is right here..

with her

Thanks again

Shit!

Hello..

Hello?

Nikhil..?

So he even calls you up now?

''Oh stop it, Rahul!
There you go again!''

He keeps calling you and you
won't even inform the police

Or is it that you've been
waiting for his calls?

Hi.
Hi

l'm making thukpa for dinner

''Care for some tea?
Yeah, sure''

l saw the doctor today.
He wants to meet you.

l've already told you.
l don't want a child

''l know, because of me..''

but..

l don't have the courage
to lose another child

''Besides, l don't want my child to
be brought up by an alcoholic''

You know l'm trying my best

''lf we have a child, maybe..
lt's too late''

''Steve, a child is not the solution
to a failed marriage''

You can at least try lra? Please..?

Haven't l tried at all?

lt's because of you
that l drink so much

So why don't you leave me?

''l can never leave you, lra''

Nor can l let you leave me ever

l want a child

''C'mon Anu.. l've said
sorry, haven't l?''

Stop being angry now.
l'm not angry

You are

This is for you

''Wow! Quite nice, thanks''

You're still angry with me?

Can l.. bribe you?

For you

Nikhil..

all this..?
lt's for you

You've gone mad!

Just leave from here! Now!

Nikhil.. you can't force
yourself on me like this

Why not?

Are you afraid that you
might start desiring me?

Shit!

This is not how..

this is not how l wished to have you

How you've made me stoop

Manoharji.. hello!
Hello

''This is Nikhil, my friend.
Hello''

Sorry you had to wait. There
was a lot of traffic

She wouldn't do that

Here you are

Thank you.
Thank you

''Why does it happen this way, lra?''

Whenever someone gets close to me..

l end up losing that person

''Nikhil, there's something
l haven't told you''

''l'm leaving tomorrow and before
l leave, l wanted to tell you..''

that Steve is my husband

What! Why didn't you
tell me that before?

Try and remember what happened
at the Anticlock that night

Nikhil.. please!

lt was Steve who fired the shot

What are you talking about?
The pistol was in my hand

The pistol was in your hand..

but it was Steve who fired

Don't mess with me! Steve..
leave me alone!

Steve..? But why?

lra..?

What happened? Where's Steve?

What happened?

Tell me

l went to see a friend today

He used to study with
me in the same college

l even told Steve before going

''When l got home, Steve
was very upset''

He.. he was drunk

''And suddenly he turned violent.
l mean, he started..''

''lt's okay. l'll look for him,
okay? Come.. come on''

Thanks

l.. l'm extremely sorry

Sit down.
Thanks.. thanks so much

l'll fetch some water for you.
Yeah

''Did l hurt you, baby?
l'm so sorry, lra!''

Please..
l don't know what comes over me

l start getting weird ideas and..
l can't control myself anymore

''Please Steve..
Let her be, Steve..''

she's hurt

''Rahul, what brings you here?''

You are the one..

who invited me to lunch.
Maybe you forgot

''Sorry, man l don't know
what's happening today''

l.. l'm really sorry about this
lt's okay. Some other time

Hi.
Hi.. what a pleasant surprise

''Steve's away in Amsterdam, isn't he?''

Yes..
l see. ls everything okay?

Maybe l shouldn't have
come here on my own

''No, that's not what
l meant. Come on in''

Come Sit down

''Give me a second, okay?''

l'm sorry.. you were busy working

That's okay

Narayan.. get some water

''What will you have? Tea, coffee.. ?''

''No, no thanks.
Why not? Have something''

Well.. nice purse.
Thank you

You..

you must've felt strange
about the other day

Thank you

l had no idea things between
the two of you were so..

We work very hard..

on trying to look
like a happy couple

How long has this been going on?

For a very long time now

Ever since Steve's export business
had to be shut down..

and he had to work
with his father..

things have really turned ugly

l can only keep hoping that
everything will turn out well

But how can he raise his hand at
you? How can you let him do that?

l'm sorry. l was feeling very lonely

''lt's okay, lra''

l've come from the doctor's

What happened?

l was pregnant

l lost my baby that day

l lost my child

Hi.
Hi

l hope l haven't come
at the wrong time?

''No, it's okay..''

''Well, since it's already
a week, l thought..''

Come in.. come

l thought l'd ask you to treat
me to a nice Sunday brunch

But..

''Rahul, you've come to
check whether l'm okay''

''Oh no, l'm really hungry..''

and l don't want to eat alone

You know l'm a great cook.
You must've heard

Yeah

''ln that case, l'll quickly
rustle up a meal..''

while you.. go and take a bath?

You don't have to
feel so responsible

because l had a good
cry at your place

l'm not feeling responsible.
lt's just that l want to..

hear a bit of praise for
my culinary skills

My cool breath..

seems to be saying
something to you..

if only you will pay heed

if only you will pay heed

My heart-beat..

it's quickening

What can l do..?

What can l do..?

''Tiptoeing into my heart,
stealthily going to my head..''

is this heady feeling

is this heady feeling

''Slowly, gradually..''

this aching awakens a fragrance

this aching awakens a fragrance

What on earth is..

coming over us?

coming over us?

What on earth is..

coming over us?

Whoever knows

These silent moments
seem to be humming..

Time has come to a standstill

''With a smile, Time bids us..''

to forget about ourselves

Why's there a smokescreen.
a haze descends..

all around us

all around us

What on earth..

is coming over us?

is coming over us?

What on earth..

is coming over us?

Whoever cares

''For a moment or two, we enjoy
this illuminating light..''

only to return to the
despairing darkness

''ln these moments, our lives..''

let's live to the fullest

Apprehension clouds my mind.
Will l see you again..?

who knows

who knows

''This moment of restraint,
in my heart..''

awakens an aching

awakens an aching

Whatever's happening to us?

Who cares

His flight arrives at 8:30

So you're going to receive him?

l ought to go. Maybe

And later?

Life will continue. Like before

l'm going to Delhi for
a few days tomorrow

l can't stand the idea of
you going back to him

''So what am l to do, Rahul?''

Come with me to Delhi

Just leave him

''You've come into my life
a bit too late, Rahul''

l don't have the courage anymore

Everything has become
far too complicated

We could at least give it a try?

But we'll never find peace

l'll always cherish the moments
we have spent together

''l'm afraid, l don't want
things to go wrong again''

Perhaps it would be best that
we don't meet ever again

Steve had got to know

And then that night at Anticlock..

He blurted out everything to
me in a drunken state one day

lsn't it strange?

Here's this girl who's the
root cause of everything..

isn't it strange that she's the one
you're about to get married to

Any news of Nikhil?

That's exactly why l
have called you here

Nikhil has been released from jail

No wonder you look so hassled. He
really had a thing for Anamika..?

Take a look at these

''So, that's why you
got me out of jail''

l wanted to tell you all
this earlier Nikhil..

So why tell me now? You want
me to kill Steve for you?

Or do you want me to bump off
Rahul for having jilted you?

So that you can live
in peace ever after?

''Please, Nikhil.. don't
misunderstand me''

What do you want me to make of this
lra? What do you want to explain?

''You know, there was so much happiness
in my life only 3 years ago''

Everything appeared
so very clear to me

l used to believe that l could
achieve anything l wanted to

But now..

l find myself a mere pawn
in your filthy games

''Sir, Nikhil is here''

''Go away, Nikhil. Don't compel
me to summon the police''

''Actually, l was here to
talk to you about lra''

''Strange, isn't it, that you
used to call me Casanova..?''

Does Anamika know?

Shoot.. go ahead! l don't have
anything to live for anyway

What could be better than dying
at the hands of my friend?

''lf l press your finger now, will
it mean you have shot yourself?''

The pistol was in my hand but it
was Steve who pulled the trigger

Steve squeezed my finger
and you know why!

l had implicit faith in you. l
thought you'd get me out of jail

But you did your best
to keep me right there

You want to see what happened to me?

Take a look! Look!

Look at this!

''This is what you thought l
deserved, isn't it? This..?''

Chandu-bhai.. please! Please!

l was raped

''l was raped, Rahul''

''Hi Rahul.. what is it, Rahul?''

''Anu, can you come here? Now?''

''lt's important, please''

''Yes, sure..''

Sit down. Will you have some tea?

What's up?

l'll make some tea for you. Sit down

No Rahul.. what is the matter?

Why have you called
me here like this?

l'm trying to muster some courage

l don't know how l'm
going to tell you

Just tell me

Before l met you..

lra and l..

lra and l had an affair

l'm sorry..

l didn't tell you earlier.
l thought..

We've been together for 3 years

Didn't you consider it necessary
to tell me about it?

Do the two of you.. even now..?

No

Why're you telling
me all this today?

l met Nikhil today

He wasn't the one who fired the shot

Wasn't him..?

The pistol was in his hand

But it was Steve who pressed
his finger on the trigger

That's why lra arranged
for Nikhil's bail

l'm going home

l can't figure out anything

l need to be alone

l'm leaving Mumbai tomorrow..

and wanted to meet you before l left

Rahul has told me everything

Come in

l wanted to talk to you about Nikhil

l know..

Nikhil has been bothering you a lot

The things that have happened
in my life..

l can't figure out anything

''Nikhil had to spend 3 years
in prison, for no reason''

l can't imagine what he
must've gone through

He survived jail only because of you

''Anamika, he's very lonely..''

also very troubled

lf you could meet him just once..

Anamika..?

Hi

You've gone through so much
of hardship because of me

You must really be hating me?

Why're you making fun of me?

''l too had liked you, Nikhil..''

when we first met

Life has played a very
cruel joke on you

''So.. what do you want
from me, Nikhil?''

l used to often have
this dream in jail

That l wake up in the morning..

to find you lying beside me

There's a slight smile on your face.

l used to get a lot of
comfort from this dream

Will you make this dream
of mine come true?

How are you?

''l'm fine, and you''

We're meeting after ages

You didn't even come to
see me at the hospital

l went there several times..

but l never could muster
the courage to meet you

Are you mad at me?

You ought to have told
me everything first

l never had the guts for anything

l even told you that you had
come into my life too late

Maybe l've finally got
to be a bit brave

''l'm leaving Mumbai, leaving Steve..''

Where are you going?
Dehradun

''Tell me, how could
l have gone away..''

without telling Nikhil the truth?

Don't hate me for being a weakling

lt'll be difficult to live
with such a lot of hatred

Oh my God

l have waited for this moment
for so many years.

lf only time would stop now..

Why do you love me so much?

l won't be able to explain

Why have you come here?

To take revenge on Rahul?

Or is it out of pity for me?

''l wanted to spend my entire
life with you,..''

so that l could give
you more love..

than there is in this world

''You love Rahul very much, don't you?''

l'm all yours and always will be

But you were not mine..

and never will be

''Go away, Anamika''

l.. l'm sorry Nikhil. l'm sorry

''My dreams, shattered''

''My loved one, separated from me''

What season is this..?

that snatches all joy from me?

''My dreams, shattered''

''My loved one, separated from me''

What season is this..?

that snatches all joy from me?

l was never in my
senses all my life

l was never in my
senses all my life

Little did l know..

l would shed tears like this

How was l to know..

that my Eden was about
to be plundered

All that l would have..

is this solitary moment

Never was l in my
senses all my life

never wasl in my
senses all my life

What you have left behind is
a tale of despairing hearts..

and where have you gone to?

ln an alien dwelling..

there's only loneliness ahead

This one moment.. the
wind blows the other way

Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

''My dreams, shattered''

''My loved one, separated from me''

What season is this..?

that snatches all joy from me?

Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

Barely have l been in my
senses during my life

l have a dinner meeting.
l'll be late tonight

What are your plans?
l'm going to the Old Age Home

l'll return by dinnertime

l must leave

You seem to be in a good mood

Take care

How will l be able to leave
if you talk so sweetly?

Bye

l love you

Anu..

''please get me the phone.
Rahul, what's the matter?''

Please hurry.. l'll tell
you later. - Okay

l thought l'd spend the day with you

But where are you off
to..? Dehradun?

''Steve, l can't stay here anymore''

You're not going anywhere

''Kill me, if you wish to''

But l'm not staying
here another moment

Why..? ls it more fun with Nikhil?

You aren't going anywhere

Leave me alone!

l'm going to kill Nikhil!

''Nikhil..
Oh God, lra!''

You got to get out of here
right now! - Calm down..

Hurry up!
Relax..

Come..

lra..

Oh my God!

There's no one in there. Their
stuff is lying scattered around..

''l'm feeling terribly scared, Rahul''

This will hurt a bit..

''sorry, sorry..''

let me take you to a doctor.
Come on..

''Let's go home, lra''

lra's not going anywhere

You shut up!

You're driving me to this!
lra..

Don't get into this.
You don't know him

Let me go.. - lra.. nothing
will happen. Relax..

Just let me go.
What are you going to do?

Kill me..? Will that
help you have lra back?

You bastard!

lra.. just listen to
me. Let's go home

''No, lra.. just move aside.
Let go of her hand.. let go!''

What do you want? What did you
gain by shooting at Rahul?

You've already ruined my life.
Just leave.. go away!

Nikhil.. Nikhil..

Nikhil! Nikhil..

Nikhil! Nikhil..

Steve!

What have you done?

All this is happening
only because of me

Only because of me!

lra!

lra..

l love you

Nikhil..

Nikhil!

Oh my God! How..?

''l'm sorry, Rahul''

Because of me..

''Nikhil, nothing's going
to happen to you''

No.. l don't think l will make it

''Nikhil, please don't say that..''

''Anamika, promise me something''

Don't you worry.. l won't
ask you to marry me

Promise me..

''Remember, l'm the helpful types?''

Couldn't you have waited
a little longer?
