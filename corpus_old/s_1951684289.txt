TO THANK EVERYBODY
FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT

TO HELP US CELEBRATE
OUR FIFTH WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY.

IT'’’S NOT OFTEN THAT,

OF YOUR DREAMS,

MUCH LESS GET A CHANCE
TO MARRY HER.

Guests: AW.

MARRIAGE THESE DAYS,
UM, IS--IS--

AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
IS NOT ANY EASY THING
TO GET RIGHT.

IT TAKES LOVE
AND HUMOR AND ATTRACTION

AND A REAL WILLINGNESS
TO REALLY, REALLY
LET YOURSELF

BE SEEN BY SOMEONE.

I KNOW PEOPLE WHO
HAVE SEARCHED THEIR
WHOLE LIVES

FOR WHAT WE HAVE,
AND I'’’M JUST GLAD
TO HAVE IT WITH YOU.

I LOVE YOU, AUDREY.

Guests: OH. AW.

Same man:
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

OH, AND WAIT. SORRY.

I WANT TO ALSO THANK
OUR GOOD FRIEND

MAY THERE BE MANY
YEARS OF CELEBRATION.
CHEERS, EVERYBODY.

AND HE'’’S SUCCESSFU

HE HAS A TERRIFIC
TRUST FUND.

AUDREY'’’S NEVER GON
NA HAVE TO WORK AGAIN
IN HER LIFE

IF SHE DOESN'’’T
FEEL LIKE IT.

YOU KNOW, I DON'’’T
KNOW WHY THEY HAVEN'’’T

STARTED A FAMILY YET,
THOUGH.

IT'’’S REALLY ODD.

YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
INTRODUCED THEM.

AUDREY'’’S MY BEST FRIEND.
MARK'’’S MY FRIEND.

THEY'’’RE REALLY
HAPPY TOGETHER.

YOU KNOW I LOVE
AUDREY.

SHE'’’S PRACTICALLY
PART OF THE FAMILY.

I'’’M ONLY SAYING
THAT, YOU KNOW,

SHE KNEW A GOOD THING
WHEN SHE SAW IT.

THE GOOD ONES GET
SNAPPED UP SO QUICKLY
AT YOUR AGE.

[TELEPHONE RINGING FAINTLY]

GOOD AFTERNOON.
GUEST RELATIONS.
THIS IS NORA.

OH, HI, MR. HARRIS.
HOW ARE YOU?

I'’’M GOOD, THANKS.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?


6 PEOPLE AT 8:00
TONIGHT AT NOUVEAU

MIGHT BE A LITTLE TRICKY.

IS THERE A BACKUP
YOU'’’D LIKE?

NO? WELL, LET ME TRY
TO WORK SOME OF MY MAGIC,

AND I'’’LL CALL YOU BACK
WITH AN ANSWER.

YOU'’’RE WELCOME. BYE.

YOUR JOB
IS SO WEIRD.

NO KIDDING.

KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

HEY, GLEN. WHAT'’’S UP?

YOU WEREN'’’T ANSWERING
YOUR PHONE,

AND MR. GABLE
IS CHECKING IN,

AND HE'’’S NOT HAPPY
WITH HIS ROOM,

AND HE'’’S BEING REALLY
HIGH-MAINTENANCE
ABOUT IT,

AND I DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.

I'’’LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

OH, HEY, AUDREY.

[TELEPHONE RINGS FAINTLY]

SORRY. I COULD TRY
ANOTHER NAME.

TRY KURT VONNEGUT.

I'’’M SORRY.
THERE'’’S NOTHING.

WELL, WHAT OTHER NAME COULD
I HAVE CHECKED IN UNDER?

TRY WALT WHITMAN.

IT'’’S NOT IN HERE.

MR. GABLE?
I'’’M NORA WILDER,

MANAGER OF GUEST
RELATIONS AND
SPECIAL SERVICES.

IS THERE A PROBLEM?

YEAH, THERE IS A PROBLEM.

I USUALLY GET A ROOM
ON THE FIFTH FLOOR.

MY ASSISTANT OR MY MANAGER
OR SOMEONE SCREWED UP,

AND NOW IT'’’S APPARENTLY
NOT THERE,

AND IT'’’S GOT, LIKE,
ARCHED WINDOWS,
WOOD FLOORS.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'’’M TALKING ABOUT?

YEAH. I THOUGHT
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
SOME MIX-UP.

THE ROOM YOU USUALLY
STAY IN IS OCCUPIED
RIGHT NOW,

BUT I CAN SHOW YOU
SOMETHING ON
THE SEVENTH FLOOR

THAT'’’S VERY SIMILAR.

ALL RIGHT.

YEAH?
YEAH.

GREAT.

I DON'’’T WANT TO SEEM
LIKE A PAIN IN THE ASS
OR ANYTHING, BUT...

NO. IT'’’S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

YEAH, WELL, HE'’’S MAKING
ME FEEL LIKE A NAZI.

YEAH. WE'’’LL TAKE CARE
OF IT RIGHT NOW.

ANYWAY...

I HOPE THIS IS
GOOD FOR YOU.

YEAH. OK. THIS IS GOOD.
IT'’’S COOL.

IT'’’S BETTER LIGHT.
THIS ONE I CAN HAVE?

YEAH.
GOOD.

GREAT. LIFE IS SO
MUCH BETTER.

I'’’LL JUST GET SOMEONE
TO BRING UP YOUR BAGS.

OH, THAT'’’D BE RAD.

HEY, THANK YOU FOR
BEING SO SWEET.

NO PROBLEM.

WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?

YOU JUST DEAL WITH PROFESSIONAL
COMPLAINERS LIKE ME?

I DEAL WITH V.I.P.s
AND THEIR NEEDS
AND WANTS.

SO I'’’M A V.I.P.

OF COURSE YOU ARE.

SO IF I NEED ANYTHING,
I CAN JUST ASK YOU?

YOU CAN ASK AT
THE FRONT DESK
OR THE CONCIERGE,

BUT I'’’M IN CHARGE
OF ALL THAT STUFF.

HOW COME I'’’VE NEVER
SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE?

I'’’VE TAKEN CARE
OF THINGS FOR YOU
IN THE PAST.

YOU JUST DIDN'’’T KNOW
BECAUSE THERE'’’S NEVER
BEEN A PROBLEM.

OH. THANKS.

SURE.

OH, SHIT.

WHAT?

CAN I ASK YOU FOR
ONE LITTLE FAVOR?

SURE.

WILL YOU GO TO
DINNER WITH ME?

UH...

OR DO THEY NOT
LET YOU DO THAT HERE?

GABLE'’’S BAGS, PLEASE?

Woman on TV:

Women on TV: AHH.

Nora:
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD
TIME THE OTHER NIGHT?

I GUESS. MARK DID.

THE WHOLE ANDREWS
FAMILY DID.

I'’’M SO STUPID.

I THINK I'’’M HAVING
A PERSONAL CRISIS.

Woman on TV: ...AS YOU EXHALE,
BEGIN TO BEND THE KNEES.

A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE BETWEEN
YOUR HANDS AND THUMB.

I HAVEN'’’T SLEPT
WITHOUT A DRINK
OR SLEEPING PILL

SINCE I CAN
REMEMBER.

JOIN THE CLUB.

NO, REALLY.

I THINK MY MARRIAGE
IS FALLING APART.

YOU DON'’’T THINK
IT'’’S JUST P.M.S.?

NO. HE'’’S DRIVING
ME NUTS.

ALL HE CARES ABOUT
IS RECOGNITION

AND GOING TO PARTIES
AND WINNING AWARDS,

INSTEAD OF JUST
DOING IT BECAUSE
IT MAKES HIM HAPPY.

I MEAN, WE USED TO
LAUGH ABOUT THAT STUFF.

G.
I'’’M SORRY.
IT'’’S JUST SO DEPRESSIN

WHAT'’’S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

I GOT ASKED OUT
ON A DATE.

THAT ACTOR.

HE'’’S THE HITMAN.
HE'’’S INTHE HITMAN.

THAT MR. GABLE?

YOU'’’RE GOING OUT
WITH A HOTEL GUEST.

ARE YOU ALLOWED TO
DATE HOTEL GUESTS?

I DON'’’T KNOW.
DO YOU THINK THAT'’’S CREEPY?

JUST DON'’’T
SLEEP WITH HIM
ON THE FIRST DATE.

OH, NO.

THAT WOULD BE
SO AVAILABLE.

I DON'’’T THINK
IT'’’S LIKE THAT.

[WOMAN SPEAKS JAPANESE]

ARIGATO.

DO YOU LIVE IN L.A.?

YEAH. I HATE IT.

OH.

WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON?

I AM WORKING ON
A MOVIE CALLED
RAIN DANCER,

WHERE I PLAY
A MEDICINE MAN,
ANWAHATU,

WHO'’’S A MEMBER
OF THE CHOCTAW
TRIBE.

THERE'’’S ACTUALLY
A WHOLE TRIBE OF
MEDICINE MEN

THAT USED TO
BASICALLY
TRAVEL AROUND

SORT OF POISONING
THE EUROPEAN SETTLERS.

OH, MY GOD.

YEAH, I KNOW.

HE'’’S KIND OF
A VILLAIN, I GUESS.

DO YOU LIKE
PLAYING BAD GUYS?

YEAH. YOU KNOW,
IT WOULD BE NICE

TO TAKE A SHOT
FOR LEADING MAN

MM-HMM.

DON'’’T WANT TO GET
PIGEONHOLED.

THAT'’’S SO COOL.

HOW ABOUT YOU?

ARE YOU INTERESTED

IT'’’S AWESOME.

SO IS THERE, LIKE,
A HOTEL SCHOOL
FOR THAT

OR SOMETHING?


NO. UM, I WENT TO
SARAH LAWRENCE.

OH. SARAH LAWRENCE.

I GOT A LIBERAL
ARTS DEGREE,

AND I WAS AN ARTS
MAJOR THERE.

I THOUGHT I'’’D DO
SOMETHING IN THE ART WORLD.

SO NOW YOU DO
JUST HOTEL STUFF,

WHICH IS COOL.

YEAH.
YEAH.

I MEAN, YOU CAN'’’T
JUST SAY YOU'’’RE
GONNA BE AN ACTOR.

YOU KNOW, YOU'’’VE
GOT TO, LIKE,

REALLY DEDICATE
YOURSELF TO IT.

YOU'’’VE GOT TO, LIK
E, GO TO SCHOOL FOR IT.

YOU CAN'’’T JUST
WALK IN AND DO IT.

YOU GOT TO STUDY,
YOU KNOW?

I STUDIED FOR...
6 MONTHS.

I DID, LIKE,
THIS INTENSIVE THING
ON "MELROSE PLACE"

WHERE YOU JUST,
FROM 10:00 TO 3:00
EVERY DAY,

YOU'’’RE IN THERE JU
ST DOING MONOLOGUES

AND DOING SCENES
FROM TV SHOWS,

AND IT'’’S UNBELIEVABLE.

IT'’’S HARD WORK.

YEAH. OF COURSE,
I THINK I'’’M GONNA
JUST WALK

INTO SOME CASTING
DIRECTOR'’’S OFFICE

WHEN I GRADUATE

AND, YOU KNOW,
JUST GET SOME BIG
HUGE ROLE

AND BECOME
A BIG STAR.

OH, DEFINITELY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

HEY, WHEN I WAS
MUCH YOUNGER,

I THOUGHT THAT
I WOULD BE MARRIED,

I'’’D HAVE KIDS, YOU KNOW,
BY THE TIME I WAS 30

AND I'’’D HAVE THE EXACT
CAREER THAT I WANTED.

I STILL DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT I WANT TO BE
WHEN I GROW UP.

I'’’M SO GLAD
I MET YOU.

ME, TOO.

NO, I'’’M SERIOUS.
I THINK YOU'’’RE
TOTALLY REFRESHING.


YEAH.

WHAT DO YOU SAY

DO YOU KNOW
HOW PRETTY YOU ARE?

THANK YOU. I THINK

AND THAT YOU'’’RE
A REALLY GOOD ACTOR

AND THAT YOU'’’RE GONNA
BE REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

I THINK SO, TOO,

ABOUT YOU.

I'’’M SORRY.

WHY? WHY?

I SHOULD HAVE
ASKED YOU IF I
SHOULD KISS YOU.

OH, DON'’’T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

I'’’M THE SPECIAL
SERVICES DIRECTOR,

AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I DON'’’T JUST
GO AROUND KISSING GUESTS.

DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE
A V.I.P.?

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

THANK YOU.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

LOOK WHO'’’S

Woman:
OH, MY GOODNESS.

HEY, DARLING.

ELEANOR, DON'’’T YOU?

HOW ARE YOU?

SIT DOWN, NORA.
I'’’LL GET YOU

WE'’’VE JUST BEEN BRAGGING
ABOUT YOUR GLAMOROUS LIFE.

YOU REMEMBER BILL,
DON'’’T YOU?

HELLO, NORA.
IT'’’S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

YOU, TOO. YOU, TOO.

SO IS IT JUST EXCITING,
RUNNING THAT LITTLE
CHIC HOTEL OF YOURS?

WELL, I DON'’’T
ACTUALLY RUN IT, BUT--

Mom: OH, SURE, SHE DOES.

SHE DOES EVERYTHING
OVER THERE.

SHE PLANS ALL THEIR PARTIES,
ALL OF THE SPECIAL EVENTS.

THEY'’’RE A PRETTY
SPOILED GROUP.

THAT'’’S MY JOB.

NORA.

DO YOU HAVE
SOMEONE SPECIAL?

WELL, UH, ACTUALLY,
I HAVE STARTED
TO SEE SOMEONE.

HE'’’S, UM--HE'’’S AN ACTOR.

ANYONE WE KNOW?

HIS NAME IS NICK GABLE.
HE'’’S INTHE HITMAN.

OH, WE JUST SAW THAT
LAST WEEK.

IT WAS TERRIFIC.

I LOVED THAT MOVIE.

REALLY? YEAH.
HE'’’S THE HITMAN.

WELL, THAT'’’S
WONDERFUL.

WELL, WHY DON'’’T YOU
INVITE HIM OVER?

WE WOULD JUST LOVE
TO MEET HIM.

YOU KNOW, WE COULD
HAVE MAYBE A LITTLE
DINNER PARTY.

THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

LET'’’S HAVE A TOAST
TO CELEBRATE

NORA HAVING
A NEW BOYFRIEND.

HEY--NICK AND NORA.

OH, YOU'’’RE
DATING YOURSELF.


A LITTLE BIT.

WHO'’’S THAT?

I DON'’’T KNOW.
LISA SOMEONE.

SOME TV ACTRESS.
SHE SCARES ME.

SHE'’’S SO TACKY.
LOOK AT THOSE LIPS.

IT'’’S THE ONLY PART
OF HER FACE
THAT CAN MOVE.

WHAT AN IDIOT.

YOU TWO ARE THE MOST
JUDGMENTAL PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD.

WHO WATCHES THESE
STUPID ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS?

IT'’’S BETTER THAN
WATCHING THE NEWS.

PROPAGANDA NIGHTMARE.

OH, LOOK. TURN IT UP.

OH.

PEOPLE WONDER WHAT'’
’S INSIDE THE MIND

OF A HITMAN.

YOU KNOW,
THESE GUYS ARE SICK,
SICK GUYS.

YOU KNOW, AS
A RESULT, THEY SPEND
A LOT OF TIME ALONE,

SO MOST OF MY SCENES
WERE SHOT VIRTUALLY
BY MYSELF, YOU KNOW.

I THINK I'’’M GONNA
BE OK, THOUGH.

OOH.

Woman on TV: DON'’’T
FEEL TOO SORRY
FOR THIS GUY.

HE'’’S BEEN DATING HIS
SEXYHITMANCOSTAR
SERENA HILL.

SERENA. OH, GOD.

OH, SERENA--SHE'’’S
A GREAT WOMAN.

SHE'’’S TOTALLY
REFRESHING,

AND, UH, I'’’M
CRAZY ABOUT HER.

WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY?

THAT'’’S PROBABLY AL
L I SHOULD SAY,

YOU KNOW
WHAT I'’’M SAYING?

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

WHY CAN'’’T I MEET
SOMEONE NICE?

THERE'’’S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU,
NORA.

YOU JUST GO OUT
WITH THE WRONG
PEOPLE.

STOP DATING ACTORS.
THEY'’’RE CRAZY.

NO, THAT'’’S
ACTRESSES.

I SHOULDN'’’T GO OUT
WITH ANYONE ANYMORE.

I'’’M GOING HOME.

HEY, DON'’’T FEEL BAD.
THAT GUY'’’S A JERK.

I LOVE YOU.

ME, TOO.

OK, I'’’LL CALL YOU.

OK.

OH, GOD.

POOR NORA.
SHE HAS THE WORST
TIME WITH MEN.

YOU KNOW,
I LOVE NORA,

BUT SHE HAS NO
INSIGHT WHEN IT
COMES TO MEN.

SHE DOESN'’’T
UNDERSTAND THE HUNT.

MEN LIKE
A CHALLENGE.

LIKE A BITCH,
LIKE ME?

KINDA.

YOU THINK I'’’M A BITCH?

COME ON, BABY.
DON'’’T FIGHT ME
ALL THE TIME.

I THINK YOU'’’RE GREAT.
I WORSHIP YOU.

I PUT YOU
ON A PEDESTAL.

LIKE AN OBJECT.

SHUT UP.

HONEY, DO YOU FEEL
ALL RIGHT?

YOU LOOK PALE.

I'’’M OK.

YOU DON'’’T THINK
YOU SHOULD SEE
THE DOCTOR?

NO. NO. I'’’M FINE.
REALLY.

THANK YOU, THOUGH.

I'’’VE JUST BEEN
WORKING TOO HARD

AND JUST DRINKING
TOO MUCH, SMOKING
TOO MUCH.

YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR LIVER?

YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE
ANYTHING TO DRINK

TWO DAYS A WEEK.

THEY DON'’’T HAVE TO
BE CONSECUTIVE.

AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW
SMOKING IS SUICIDE.

MM-HMM.

HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

OH, IT'’’S OVER.

OH, IS THAT WHY
YOU'’’RE DEPRESSED?

NO, THAT'’’S NOT IT.

I JUST FEEL LIKE
I HAVE THE WORST
LUCK IN THE WORLD

WHEN IT COMES
TO MEN.

I THINK I MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING
HORRIBLY WRONG,

BUT I DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

WHAT HAPPENED?

OH, HE HAS
A GIRLFRIEND.

OH.

YOU KNOW, I CAN'’’T
QUIT THINKING ABOUT

HOW HARD IT MUST BE
FOR YOUNG WOMEN NOWADAYS.

I MEAN, ON THE ONE HAND,
THE WORLD IS WIDE OPEN
TO YOU.

ALL THE CHOICES YOU WANT.

I THINK THERE ARE
TOO MANY CHOICES, REALLY.

IT JUST MUST BE
VERY CONFUSING

TO TRY TO FIND
A PATH THROUGH ALL OF THAT,

ESPECIALLY WITH MEN,

THOUGH YOU HAVE HAD
SOME VERY NICE BOYFRIENDS.

I KNOW...

BUT THAT WAS COLLEGE.

I DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

I FEEL SO CLOSED OFF,

SO DESPERATE TO FIND
SOMEONE TO LOVE.

OH, HONEY.

EVEN I CAN'’’T STAND
THE SIGHT OF
MY OWN DESPERATION.

HONEY, HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU'’’RE IN A FUNK,
THAT'’’S ALL,

AND THERE'’’S ONLY
ONE WAY TO GET
OUT OF A FUNK,

AND THAT IS TO
ENGAGE.

EVEN IF YOU DON'’’T
FEEL LIKE IT,
JUST FAKE IT.

JUST GO OUT AND GET
THE HIGHEST HEELS IN TOWN

AND SOME NEW LIPSTICK
AND GO EVERYPLACE.


SMILE. ACT LIKE
YOU'’’RE HAVING THE TIME
OF YOUR LIFE.

BUT DON'’’T ALWAYS GO
WITH MARRIED COUPLES.

YOU'’’RE NEVER GONNA
MEET ANYONE THAT WAY.

SURE. I'’’LL GIVE IT
A TRY, YOU KNOW.

YOU KNOW...

I COULD FIX YOU UP.

NO.

NOW, JUST LISTEN
TO ME FOR A MINUTE.

YOU KNOW MEGAN ROSS,
MY FRIEND.

SHE HAS A SON.
I DON'’’T THINK YOU'’’VE
EVER MET HIM.

NICE-LOOKING,
SUCCESSFUL,

AND I KNOW HE'’’S NOT
SEEING ANYONE
RIGHT NOW.

ARE YOU NORA?

YES.

I'’’M CHARLIE ROSS.

HI.
HI.

NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU, TOO.

IT'’’S PRETTY FUNNY
THAT OUR MOMS
SET US UP.

YOU DON'’’T KNOW
THE IRONY BEHIND IT.

I'’’M GLAD.

ME, TOO.

I HAVEN'’’T SEEN THIS
MOVIE IN A REALLY
LONG TIME.

IT'’’S ONE OF
MY FAVORITE FILMS.

YEAH? NO, I LOVE
THIS FILM, TOO.

I'’’VE NEVER SEEN IT
IN A THEATER, THOUGH.

REALLY?
YEAH.

UH, SHOULD WE GO IN
AND GET SEATS?

YEAH.

Woman: YESTERDAY,
ABOUT 3 P.M.

I WANTED YOU TO THINK
ABOUT IT TWICE, TOO.

[ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING]

Man: I'’’VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE FOR
A LONG TIME.

I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

IT REALLY HOLDS UP.

BOGART REMINDS ME
OF MY DAD.

I MET YOUR DAD ONCE.

HE SEEMED LIKE
A GREAT GUY.

M.
I'’’M SORRY ABOUT HI

YEAH, ME, TOO.
I REALLY MISS HIM.

I FEEL LUCKY TO HAVE
HAD HIM AT ALL, REALLY.

NOW MY MOM HAS IRVING,
SO SHE'’’S NOT ALONE.

YEAH. MY MOM DOESN'’
’T REALLY DATE ANYONE
ANYMORE.

SHE WENT THROUGH
A STRING OF THEM

AFTER MY PARENTS
DIVORCED,

BUT SHE ALWAYS
DRIVES THEM AWAY,

ON PURPOSE,
I THINK.

I WONDER IF WE ALWAYS
TURN INTO OUR PARENTS.

I LIKE TO THINK
OF IT AS WHERE MY
PARENTS LEFT OFF.

THAT'’’S A GREAT WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

OH, SHIT.

Nora: WHAT?

UH, NOTHING.
IT'’’S JUST MY E
X, JENNIFER.

Y.
SHE'’’S TOTALLY CRAZ

IS IT GONNA BE OK?

HI, JENNIFER.

HELLO, CHARLIE.

HOW ARE YOU?
THIS IS NORA.

"HOW ARE YOU?"
HOW AM I?

I'’’M FUCKING
GREAT, CHARLIE.
HOW ARE YOU?

AND NORA?

WE'’’RE GOOD.
WE'’’RE GOOD.

WE JUST WENT
TO THE MOVIES.

HE TOOK YOU TO SEE
AN OLD ROMANTIC MOVIE.

IT'’’S HIS SIGNATURE
MOVE, YOU KNOW.

MY MOM WAS--

CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND?

I'’’M SORRY.

Charlie: WHY
ARE YOU DOING THIS?

Jennifer: WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN--

I JUST TALKED TO YOU
THIS MORNING.

YOU SAID YOU WEREN'’’T
DATING ANYBODY.

Charlie: I'’’M NOT
DATING ANYBODY.

SHE'’’S THE DAUGHTER
OF MY MOM'’’S FRIEND.

I THINK I BROUGHT
HER HERE BECAUSE I...

I WAS MISSING YOU,
AND THIS REMINDED ME
OF OUR FIRST DATE.

DON'’’T TOUCH ME.

.
HEY, WE'’’RE LEAVING

ARE YOU OK?

LOOK, I'’’M SO SORRY
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

WHAT HAPPENED?

WE HAVEN'’’T BEEN
BROKEN UP THAT LONG.

IT'’’S--IT'’’S BEEN
REALLY HARD.

YOU'’’RE ACTUALLY
THE FIRST PERSON I'’’VE
DATED SINCE JENNIFER.

I THINK I'’’M STILL
IN LOVE WITH HER.

I'’’M--I'’’M SO SORRY.
THIS WAS--IT WAS
TOO SOON.

UM, YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'’’M JUST GONNA GO.

I'’’M JUST SO, YOU KNOW,
OUT OF IT.

IS IT OK IF I JUST
PUT YOU IN A CAB?

YEAH.

I'’’M REALLY SORRY.
YOU'’’RE SO NICE.

Nora: MEN HATE ME.

YOU HATE YOURSELF.

NO, I DON'’’T.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

YOU'’’VE GOT TO STOP
PUNISHING YOURSELF
ALL THE TIME

FOR NOT HAVING
A BOYFRIEND.

EVERYONE ELSE IS
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

WHY CAN'’’T I
BE IN ONE?

YOU'’’LL MEET SOMEONE.
JUST DON'’’T GO NUTS
NEXT TIME.

IT'’’S LIKE THE ONLY
THING THAT MATTERS
IS FINDING THIS GUY.

IT DOESN'’’T EVEN MATTER
WHO IT IS.

NOT EVERY GUY YOU MEET
HAS TO BE YOUR
FUTURE HUSBAND.

BELIEVE ME.
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

GO TO YOGA OR SOMETHING.

YOU'’’RE RIGHT.
I'’’M BEING A TOTAL
FREAK.

I HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

I LOVE YOU.
I DON'’’T LIKE TO
SEE YOU LIKE THIS.

[CELL PHONE MUSIC PLAYS]

OH, GOD. ONE MINUTE.

YEAH. UH-HUH.

OK.

IT'’’S MARK. HE'’’LL BE HERE
IN TWO MINUTES.

WHERE WAS HE?

MMM. HAVING A MEETING WITH
THAT ACTRESS CAITLIN FOX.

OH, NO.

YEAH. SHE WANTS HIM
TO DIRECT HER

IN A MOVIE
ABOUT FAIRIES.

BARF.

I KNOW.

I DON'’’T WANT TO SOUND
LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

I JUST FEEL LIKE
WE'’’RE NOT BEST FRIENDS
ANYMORE.

DO YOU TALK ABOUT IT?

YEAH, WE HAVE BEEN.

HE THINKS EVERYTHING
IS FINE AND THAT I'’’M
JUST FREAKING OUT.

I SWEAR, IF HE BLAMES IT
ON MY HORMONES
ONE MORE TIME,

I'’’M GONNA LOSE IT.

HE'’’S THE ONE WHO'’’S
HESITANT ABOUT HAVING KIDS.

REALLY?

.
I DIDN'’’T KNOW THAT

YEAH, WHATEVER.
I DON'’’T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

LET'’’S JUST DROP IT.

BUT I CAN'’’T BELIEVE
YOU'’’RE NOT COMING
TO MIAMI WITH US.

PLEASE COME.
MARK WILL PAY.

I JUST DON'’’T
FEEL LIKE IT.

I JUST WANT TO
STAY HERE.

NORA, THIS IS JULIAN.

HELLO, NORA.

HI.

IS THIS YOUR FIANCEE?

NO. WE WORK TOGETHER.

OH. COOL. WOULD YOU HAVE
ANOTHER DRINK WITH ME?

NORA HAS GOT
TO LEAVE.

NO! WHY? WHY ARE
YOU LEAVING?

I'’’M TIRED.
I'’’M EXHAUSTED.

IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU,
THOUGH.

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

CONVINCING YOU
TO STAY.

COME ON,
FOR JUST ONE DRINK.

PLEASE.

OK.

Glen: HA HA HA!
MON AMI.

HOW DO YOU KNOW
THIS GUY?

WELL, I LIVED
FOR A YEAR

WITH HIS FAMILY
IN FRANCE.

IT'’’S A LONG STORY.

SO, UM, CAN I GET
YOU GUYS A DRINK?

YEAH. I'’’LL HAVE
A VODKA STRAIGHT UP
WITH A TWIST.

OOH. ET JULIAN?

YEAH, I'’’LL HAVE
THE SAME.

OK.

WHO HAD A PILLOW.

OH, YEAH.

HI.

[SPEAKING FRENCH]

[SPEAKING FRENCH]

[GLEN LAUGHS]

YOU DON'’’T
SPEAK FRENCH?

IN HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT NO, NOT REALLY.

TU ES TREÈÈS JOLIE,

THANKS.

YOU DON'’’T BELIEVE ME?

NO, I BELIEVE YOU.

I JUST DON'’’T THINK
YOU'’’RE PROBABLY
THAT PICKY.

I DON'’’T UNDERSTAND.

FORGET IT.

I'’’M GLAD YOU ARE HERE.

ONE MORE MINUTE,
AND WE WOULD HAVE
MISSED EACH OTHER.

IT'’’S FATE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, DON'’’T YOU THINK?

WHY DO YOU LAUGH?

YOU ARE AFRAID?

YOU KNOW, YOUR
APPROACH IS JUST
REALLY INTENSE.

DO YOU WANT
ANOTHER DRINK?

YEAH.

OH.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN NEW YORK?

I CAME HERE
TO MEET YOU.

NO. REALLY.

NO, REALLY,
I CAME HERE TO DO
SOME WORK

ON A PROJECT,
ON A FILM.

YOU'’’RE NOT
AN ACTOR, ARE YOU?

NO.

GOOD.

YOU KNOW, ONCE
YOU'’’RE CALM,

YOU'’’RE NOT THAT BAD.

WHY?

WHY WHAT?

WHY WAS I BAD?

NO, I'’’M SAYING THAT
YOU'’’RE NOT BAD.

OH. COOL.

LET'’’S GO SOMEWHERE.

I DON'’’T THINK SO.

WHY NOT?

I'’’M NOT LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING.

TROUBLE.

TROUBLE?
I'’’M NO TROUBLE.

I'’’M NOT LOOKING
FOR TROUBLE.

WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO GO?

SHOW ME SOMETHING.

VERY NEW YORK.

[DOOR CLOSES]


NO.

I DON'’’T WANT YOU
TO KISS ME.

I TOLD YOU NO.

WHY?

OH.

BUT I JUST WANT
TO KISS YOU.

NO.

NO.

COME ON.

NO. I'’’M SORRY.

EXCUSE ME.

[DOOR OPENS]

OK, YOU DON'’’T LIKE ME.

IT'’’S MORE LIKE
I DON'’’T WANT Y
OU TO KISS ME.

WHY NOT?

I DON'’’T KNOW.
BECAUSE.

I DON'’’T KNOW.
WE WERE HAVING
SOME FUN,

AND YOU ARE
SO BEAUTIFUL.

I JUST WANTED
TO KISS YOU.

WELL...

LISTEN, I HAD
A GREAT NIGHT
WITH YOU TONIGHT,

BUT I JUST
WANT TO GO HOME.

OH, NO.
COME ON, NORA.

I'’’M EXCITING
TO BE WITH YOU.

IT'’’S LATE.

THERE'’’S NOTHING
TO DO.

I WOULDN'’’T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

BUT WE'’’LL FIND
SOMETHING.

COME ON.
IT'’’S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

I PROMISE.

WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO?

WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO GO?

WE'’’LL GO IN HERE.

HERE?

[LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

NORA, DANCE WITH ME.

OH, NO, NO.
BREAK. BREAK.

UH, TWO SHOTS
OF TEQUILA.

IS THAT OK WITH YOU?

YEAH.

OK.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

ALL I NEED IS
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

BOBBY.

NORA.
HEY, BABY.

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

I WAS ON TOUR
IN PHILLY.
I HAD THE NIGHT OFF.

I CAME BACK.
I HAD TO DO A FEW THINGS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

ACTUALLY, I HAVE
HIM WITH ME.

VERY NICE.

SO YOU WANT TO BE
ALONE, NO?

NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS PERFECT.


OH, MY GOD.
IT'’’S SO CRAZY.

AY, AY, AY.

AND YOU, JULIAN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

ARE YOU ON VACATION?

Nora: HE'’’S WORKING
ON A MOVIE.

HE'’’S NOT AN ACTOR, THOUGH.

Bobby: NO?

I CAME HERE
FOR A WOMAN.

AY, DIOS MIO.
NO, PLEASE. OK.

TELL ME. LET'’’S GO.

SHE WAS MY GIRLFRIEND,
SHE'’’S AN ACTRESS,

AND SHE CAME HERE
TO DO A MOVIE,

SO I TAKE A JOB
ON THE MOVIE SO I CAN
BE CLOSE TO HER.

BUT THEN SHE LEAVES ME
FOR THE ACTOR
IN THE MOVIE.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

THAT'’’S TERRIBLE.

SO YOU'’’RE NO GOOD
AT LOVE, TOO, HUH?

NO. TREÈÈS MAUVAIS.

OK. KIDDIES,
I GOT TO GO.

IT'’’S GETTING LATE.

IT'’’S SO LATE,
IT'’’S ALMOST EARLY.

IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU.

I HOPE TO SEE YOU
AROUND MORE.

OK, AND THANK YOU
FOR THE SMOKE.

AH.

CIAO.

Bobby: OH.

SHE'’’S A VERY
GOOD GIRL, OK?

YES. I KNOW.

OK. CIAO BELLO.

HI.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I'’’M MAKING YOU COFFEE?

I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

NO. I'’’M HERE.

YOU HAVE PLANS
FOR TODAY?

UH, NO. NO.
I GUESS NOT.

IT'’’S OK, THEN?

YEAH. YEAH.

[GLASS CLATTERS]

GOD.

SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

I'’’M ANGRY.

YEAH? ABOUT WHAT?

I DON'’’T KNOW.
ANYTHING.

WHAT?

I'’’M ANGRY.

OH, YOU'’’RE HUNGRY. OH.

I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE ANGRY.

OH, NO. NEVER.
NEVER.

SO WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO EAT?

FOOD. MANJA.

COME ON.

I HAD A NICE TIME
WITH YOU LAST NIGHT.

REALLY?

YEAH, SURE.

EVEN THOUGH
WE DIDN'’’T HAVE SEX?

OF COURSE.

WHY NOT?

DO YOU THINK
IF YOU DON'’’T HAVE
SEX WITH A MAN,

HE DOES NOT
LIKE YOU?

NO.

I DON'’’T KNOW. MAYBE.

I THINK IT JUST
DEPENDS ON THE GUY.

YOU DON'’’T HAVE ANY
HANG-UPS, DO YOU?

WHAT IS HANG-UPS?

PROBLEMS, FEARS,
THINGS THAT SCARE YOU.

LIKE WHAT THINGS?

I DON'’’T KNOW.

UH, HEART ATTACKS,
TERRORISM,

RANDOM
ACTS OF VIOLENCE,

WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK,

NOT SUCCEEDING
IN LIFE.

WOW. THAT'’’S A LOT.

NO. WHEN I WAS
8 YEARS OLD,

MY MOTHER DIED,
AND MY FATHER
TOLD ME

THAT LIFE WAS
SOMETHING SHORT

AND TO ALWAYS MAKE
SOME VALUE IN IT.

WHEN MY FATHER DIED,
I THINK I DID THE OPPOSITE.

IS HE STILL ALIVE,
YOUR DAD?

YES. HE LIVES
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.

MARSEILLES.

MARSEILLES?

COME ON, NORA.

YOU'’’VE GOT TO
GO SOMEWHERE.

I KNOW. YOU'’’RE RIGHT.

WE'’’VE BEEN
WALKING A LOT.

ARE YOU TIRED
OF WALKING?

NO. IT'’’S PERFECT.

YEAH?

I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

Nora: I LOVE THESE PENGUINS.

SOMETIMES WHEN I'’’M SAD,
I COME HERE

AND JUST WATCH THEM.

THEY MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

COME HERE.

COME HERE.

I WANT TO KISS YOU.


LA PIROUETTE.

LA PIROUETTE.

BIEN. PIROUETTE.

PWE WET.

PWE WET?


[SPEAKING FRENCH]

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO A FRENCH GIRL

IF YOU WERE HAVING
SEX WITH HER?

I WOULD SAY, "OH! OH!

C'’’EST TREÈÈS BON!"

AH! HA HA HA!

ARE YOU STARTING
TO LOVE ME?

HA HA! I'’’M NOT READY

TO GIVE OUT THAT
INFORMATION AT THIS TIME.

.
NORA, YOU ARE THE EXACT
GIRL THAT'’’S ON MY MIND


SHH. SHH. SHH.

Julian:
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

HEY.

NOTHING.

I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT HOW I WAS TELLING
MY FRIEND AUDREY

THAT I WASN'’’T GONNA
SEE ANYONE.

AND I CHANGED
YOUR MIND?

ARE YOU SEEING
ANYONE RIGHT NOW?

NO, NOT NOW.
JUST YOU.

BUT YOU DO SEE
OTHER WOMEN.

IF I MEET SOMEONE
I LIKE, YES.

WHY? WHAT?

NOTHING.
OF COURSE YOU DO.

BUT YOU DON'’’T?

WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?

WE TAKE A BATH.

WHY DO YOU TALK
ABOUT LOVE?

WHEN?

BEFORE.

I'’’M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

IF THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

I DON'’’T KNOW, NORA.

WE HAVE NO CONTRACT.

WE ARE JUST MEETING
EACH OTHER.

YOU'’’RE RIGHT.
I'’’M SORRY,
I'’’M SORRY.

YOU STILL DIDN'’’T
TELL ME WHAT YOU DO.

I START TO RECORD
SOUND ON MOVIES.

AH. MYSTERY SOLVED.

DO YOU LIKE IT?
IS IT FUN?

YES, I LIKE IT.

I LIKE TO LISTEN
TO PEOPLE,

TO HEAR THEIR VOICE,
HOW THEY FEEL,

AND I GET TO TRAVEL.

BUT THERE'’’S
NOT ONLY WORK.

I ALSO PLAY
SOME MUSIC.

UGH. I'’’M SO GLAD
I DON'’’T HAVE
AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR.

NORA?

GUY, HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

I'’’M GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU?

GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

I'’’M GREAT.
I JUST GOT BACK

FROM A WEDDING
IN ROME LAST NIGHT.

YOU KNOW JIM, RIGHT?
YEAH.

YEAH. IT WAS
HIS WEDDING.

IT WAS TOTALLY
INSANE.

THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

YEAH. HEY.
UH, I'’’M GUY.

SORRY.

HI. I'’’M JULIAN.

YOU, UH, YOU
AROUND THIS SUMMER?

YEAH. YEAH.
I HAVE NO PLANS.

I'’’M JUST WORKING,
YOU KNOW?

OK. WELL, COOL.

UM, I'’’M HERE
AND AT THE BEACH,

SO I'’’LL GIVE YOU
A CALL.

GREAT.
NICE TO MEET YOU,
MAN.

NICE TO MEET YOU.

SEE YOU.
BYE.

I'’’LL HAVE, UM,
HALF A DOZEN

OF THE WHITE COOKIES
WITH THE SPRINKLES

AND, UM--THEY'’’RE
FAMOUS FOR THEIR
CANNOLIS.

I'’’LL HAVE A HALF
A DOZEN OF THOSE

AND, UM...


I'’’M SO SORRY.
I WAS SO RUDE.

I DON'’’T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

I'’’M JUST SO STUPID
SOMETIMES.

I JUST GOT CAUGHT
OFF GUARD.

I'’’M JUST NOT USED
TO BEING WITH SOMEONE.

I MEAN, NOT THAT WE'’’RE
TOGETHER OR ANYTHING,

BUT I'’’M JUST NOT
THAT EXPERIENCED

IN HOW TO ACT
WITH A GUY.

IT'’’S JUST SO WEIRD
YOU COME INTO MY LIFE,

AND--I DON'’’T KNOW--
YOU'’’VE...

I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

What are you doing here?

I'’’m such a freak.

I'’’VE TURNED INTO
SUCH A BITCH.


[DOOR CREAKING]

[WATER RUNNING]

[DOOR CREAKING]

ARE YOU OK?

YEAH.

.
I'’’M NOT MAD AT YOU

OH, GOOD.
I'’’M RELIEVED.

SOMETHING WRONG?

I JUST WANT TO
GO HOME.

HEY. I DON'’’T THINK
YOU'’’RE OK.

I'’’M OK. I JUST WANT
TO GO HOME.

DO YOU RUN FROM ME?
NO.

DO YOU FEEL SICK?

YES, I FEEL SICK.

I FEEL LIKE I'’’M
GOING TO DIE.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

OH, COME ON, NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

NO, NO!
GIVE IT TO ME!

GIVE IT TO ME!
I'’’M NOT GONNA KILL MYSELF!

I'’’M JUST GONNA
TAKE ONE!

[PILLS RATTLE]

[WATER RUNNING]

ARE YOU OK?

I WILL BE.

IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU?

YEAH. I'’’M A FREAK.

I HAD
AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

DO YOU WANT ME
TO STAY WITH YOU,

OR DO YOU WANT
TO BE ALONE?

YOU CAN STAY.

I'’’M NOT GOOD FOR A
NY ACTION, THOUGH.

THAT HASN'’’T HAPPEN
ED IN A REALLY
LONG TIME.

IT'’’S REALLY SCARY.

JULIAN?

JULIAN?

HI.

HEY. YOU CAME BACK.

I'’’M--I'’’M VERY SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

NO. I'’’M SORRY.
I'’’M JUST AN IDIOT.

YOU DIDN'’’T DO
ANYTHING.

I JUST BLEW THINGS
OUT OF PROPORTION.

WE WERE HAVING
SO MUCH FUN.

I'’’M FINE NOW.

YOU KNOW, NORA,
I'’’M LEAVING TOMORROW,

AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD SPEND THIS NIGHT
TOGETHER IF YOU WANT.

TOMORROW?

YES. VERY EARLY.

I HAD THE BEST TIME
WITH YOU, NORA.

ME, TOO.

COME WITH ME.
COME TO SEE PARIS.

COME ON THE PLANE
TOMORROW

AND RUN AWAY
WITH ME.

NO. I CAN'’’T.

I CAN'’’T.
WHY NOT?

A MILLION REASONS.

LIKE, I COULDN'’’T
POSSIBLY BE READY
TO DO THAT IN TIME.

I--I HAVE TO WORK.
I HAVE OBLIGATIONS.

THOSE ARE ONLY SOME
EXCUSES, ALL RIGHT?

I WANT YOU TO COME.

WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

STAY ALL YOUR LIFE,
DO THE SAME THING?

NO. I'’’M--I'’’M JUST
BEING REALISTIC.

WE'’’VE ONLY
KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

I CAN'’’T JUST PRETEND
THAT EVERYTHING

WOULD JUST MAGICALLY
WORK ITSELF OUT.

I KNOW BETTER.

YOU SHOULDN'’’T MAKE
PROMISES THAT YOU
CAN'’’T KEEP.

WHY NOT?

I DON'’’T KNOW.
UH...

IT'’’S JUST NOT WHAT
I IMAGINED FOR MYSELF.

I'’’M NOT LIKE THAT.

WHY? BECAUSE
I'’’M FRENCH,

BECAUSE I'’’M YOUNGE
R THAN YOU?

WHAT IS IT?

YEAH. YOU LIVE
IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.

WE'’’VE HAD
A REALLY NICE WEEKEND.

YOU SHOULDN'’’T FEEL
BAD ABOUT IT.

I DON'’’T WANT TO
FIGHT ABOUT THIS NOW.

I'’’LL COME TO PARIS
WITH YOU

AND WE'’’LL JUST SEE
HOW IT GOES SOMETIME
IN THE FUTURE.

YOU PROMISE?

YEAH.

[ALARM CLOCK BUZZING]

OK, NORA.
I HAVE TO GO.

I HAD A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU.

DON'’’T CRY.

I LEFT MY CELL PHONE
NUMBER NEXT
TO YOUR BED.


COME HERE.

KISS ME.

[DOOR CLOSES]

WHAT?

YOU NEED TO GO
ON A DATE.

UGH. NO.
MM-HMM.

DUTY DATING.

WHAT'’’S THAT?

THERE'’’S A THEORY
THAT YOU SHOULD
GO OUT

WITH GUYS
WHO ASK YOU OUT,

EVEN IF YOU KNOW
YOU DON'’’T LIKE THE
M IN THAT WAY.

FOR PRACTICE.

THAT IS THE SADDEST
THING I THINK I'’’VE
EVER HEARD.

NO, IT'’’S NOT.

YOU NEED TO
GET OUT THERE AGAIN.

OTHERWISE, YOU'’’RE
JUST GONNA RETREAT.

I KNOW YOU, NORA.

NOBODY'’’S ASKING
ME OUT.

UH-UH

STEVE, YOU TELL NORA
YOU WERE AN ARCHITECT?

YEAH. I WAS DOING
PRIVATE HOMES
AND OFFICE BUILDINGS.

I MOSTLY BUILD
BOUTIQUE HOTELS NOW.

I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'’’S REALLY
CHALLENGING, YOU KNOW...

MM-HMM.
MAKING EACH ONE
DIFFERENT.

MM.

NORA WORKS
IN A HOTEL,
SULLIVAN HOUSE.

IS THAT RIGHT?

YEAH.

DO YOU LIKE IT?

NO.

NOT REALLY.

HI, NORA.

YOU GOT A MINUTE?

YEAH.

I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU SERIOUSLY

JUST FOR A BIT.

OK.

I WAS WONDERING, UM,
HOW IT'’’S GOING,

HOW YOU'’’RE DOING
WITH THE PLANNING
OF THE COMPANY PICNIC.

OH. THAT.

UM, I, UH, HAVEN'’’T
REALLY GOTTEN
AROUND TO IT YET.

WE'’’VE BEEN
KIND OF SWAMPED.

HAVEN'’’T GOT
AROUND TO IT YET?

UH, NORA, THERE'’’S
ONLY 5 WEEKS LEFT.

I MEAN, THERE'’’S
A LOT MORE TO IT

THAN--THAN JUST
LOCATIONS ALONE.

I MEAN, YOU'’’VE GOT FOOD
AND INVITES, BUSES,

GAMES,
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.

HAVE YOU EVEN VOTED
FOR THE EMPLOYEE
OF THE MONTH YET?

NOT YET.

WELL, WHEN WERE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING
ALL OF THIS?

T.
I DON'’’T KNOW.
I'’’M SORRY. I FORGO

LOOK. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'’’T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'’’S WRONG

WITH YOU LATELY, NORA.

YOU WERE ALWAYS
SO RELIABLE,

AND NOW YOU DON'’’T EVEN
COME AROUND ANYMORE.

NOBODY'’’S SEEN YOU.
WHAT'’’S WRONG WITH YOU?

IS EVERYTHING OK?

BECAUSE YOU CANNOT
GO ON LIKE THIS.

YOU KNOW
WHAT, PERRY?
YOU'’’RE RIGHT.

I CAN'’’T GO ON
LIKE THIS.

I'’’VE BEEN AWFUL.

I CAN'’’T DO THIS
ANYMORE.

DO WHAT?

THIS! I CAN'’’T
DO THIS ANYMORE!

I SEE SOMETHING
IN YOU.

HUH?

I CAN TELL YOU THINGS
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

YOUR FATHER
MISSES YOU.

YOU WERE HIS FAVORITE
PERSON IN THE WORLD.


HE KNOWS HOW LONELY
YOU ARE,

AND HE WANTS ME
TO HELP YOU.

COME INSIDE.

Audrey:
SO WAIT A MINUTE.

YOU WENT TO
A PSYCHIC TO HAVE

A CURSE PUT ON YOU.

PLEASE. I'’’M HUMILIATED
ENOUGH AS IT IS.

SHE DIDN'’’T PUT
A CURSE ON ME.

SHE REMOVED A CURSE.

DID YOU PAY HER?

I DON'’’T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

NO. PLEASE.
I HAVE TO KNOW

SO I CAN UNDERSTAND
YOUR INSANITY.

I DON'’’T KNOW.

I'’’M GOING
TOTALLY CRAZY.

YOU'’’LL BE FINE.

NO, I WON'’’T.
I QUIT MY JOB,

AND I WENT
TO A WITCHDOCTOR.

I CAN'’’T BELIEVE
YOU QUIT YOUR JOB.

I KNOW.

DO YOU THINK THAT
WAS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO?

MAYBE IT WAS.

MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
GONE WITH JULIAN.

WHY DIDN'’’T YOU?

I'’’M A COWARD.

SO...WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

IS THIS SAFE?

IT'’’S FINE. RELAX.

WE DON'’’T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'’’S IN HERE.

?
WHAT IF IT'’’S DRUGS

IT IS NOT DRUGS.
MY PARENTS KNOW THE GUY.

I CAN'’’T BELIEVE
WE'’’RE DOING THIS.

LISTEN. IT WAS THE ONLY
CHEAP TICKET. I SWEAR.

OH! I HATE MARK.

HE'’’S MAD THAT WE'’’RE
DOING THIS COURIER SHIT,

RIDING COACH. OY.

Audrey: UH, HI.
WE'’’RE NOT SURE
WHERE TO GO.

UM, WE NEED A SMALL,
LITTLE HOTEL

IN THE MIDDLE
OF TOWN THAT'’’S NOT
VERY EXPENSIVE.

I DON'’’T THINK HE
UNDERSTANDS YOU.

OH, NO.
I THINK HE DOES.

THEY JUST PRETEND
NOT TO UNDERSTAND.

WATCH THIS.

EXCUSEZ-MOI.
VOUS COMPRENDRE?

OUI, OUI.
I UNDERSTAND.

HMM?

MERCI BEAUCOUP.

THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

I HOPE YOU FIND
HAPPINESS.

A PENIS?

YES.

OH...

SKANKY.

WELL, AT LEAST IT
HAS A BATHROOM.

THIS REALLY SUCKS.
I'’’M SORRY, AUDREY.

DON'’’T BE RIDICULOUS.
WE'’’RE IN PARIS.

WE'’’RE GONNA FIND
JULIAN.

LET'’’S DELIVER THES
E PACKAGES FIRST,

GET IT OUT
OF THE WAY.

WE'’’RE SO CRAZY
FOR DOING THIS.

.
I KNOW.
IT'’’S TOTALLY CRAZY

YOU KNOW, WE COULD
PROBABLY GET A MAP
DOWNSTAIRS.

OH, YOU'’’RE SO ON IT.

WELL, IT'’’S PROBABL
Y JUST EASIER FOR ME

TO BE OBJECTIVE
RIGHT NOW.

WHEN SHOULD WE MEET
BACK HERE?

I DON'’’T KNOW.
LIKE AN HOUR,
AN HOUR AND A HALF?

BUT IF WE GET
HELD UP, LET'’’S JUS
T CALL THE HOTEL

AND TOUCH BASE, OK?
OK.

OK. NOW WHICH WAY
IS THE SEINE?

BECAUSE I AM GOING
THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION.

EXCUSEZ-MOI.
OUI?

DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?
A LITTLE.

COULD YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE HOTEL MEURICE IS?

UH, IT'’’S JUST
OVER THERE.

OK. GREAT.

[NO AUDIO]

[NO AUDIO]

MADAME GRENELLE?

MADAME GRENELLE?

QUI EST LAÁÁ?

Nora: UH, I'’’M SORRY.

JE NE PARLEZ FRANCÇÇAIS.

DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?

OF COURSE I SPEAK
ENGLISH.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

MY NAME IS NORA.
I HAVE A PACKAGE FOR YOU.

THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

WELL, BRING IT
TO ME.

I HOPE I'’’M NOT
BOTHERING YOU.

IT'’’S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

EXCUSE ME?

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

MR. LARSON?

HI. I'’’M AUDREY.

COME IN.

PLEASE SIT DOWN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I WOULDN'’’T ENTRUST THI
S TO THE REGULAR MAIL.

BUT I HAVE TO SAY
I DIDN'’’T IMAGINE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU

DELIVERING IT TO ME.

ARE YOU SURPRISED?

YES.

ARE YOU HUNGRY?

UM, ACTUALLY,
YEAH, I AM.

LET'’’S GO.

YOU TURNED OUT
VERY PRETTY.

THANK YOU.

YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER
NEVER LET ME SEE YOU MUCH.

I THINK SHE WAS
ASHAMED OF ME,

AND SHE MOVED
TO AMERICA.

SHE WAS ALWAYS TAKING
THESE WILD CHANCES,

AND YOUR FATHER
WAS QUITE HANDSOME.

WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

NEW YORK CITY.

ARE YOU MARRIED?

NO.

BUT YOU WANT TO BE.

YEAH. I GUESS SO.

WHY?

I DON'’’T KNOW.

I, UM...

I GUESS THEN I WOULD
REALLY KNOW THAT
SOMEONE LOVED ME.

MARRIAGE IS A CONTRACT,

BUT TO FEEL LOVE IS
SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.

I DON'’’T THINK I'’’
VE EVER REALLY BEEN
IN LOVE.

YOU HAVE PROBABLY
BEEN IN LOVE
LOTS OF TIMES.

BESIDES, YOU ARE YOUNG.
YOU HAVE TIME.

BUT I'’’M GETTING
OLDER.

YOU WILL BE FINE.
YOU ARE FROM GOOD STOCK.

DON'’’T LET ANYONE
TELL YOU OTHERWISE.

YOU WILL GET NOWHERE
IN THIS WORLD

BY FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO YOU WHEN YOUR FRIEND
FINDS THIS MAN?

DEPENDING ON HOW
HAPPY HE IS
TO SEE HER,

EITHER I'’’LL LEAVE
ON MY OWN,

OR I'’’LL TAKE
NORA WITH ME.

I LOVE BEING
IN PARIS.

MY WIFE
LOVES IT HERE.

SOMETIMES COMES
WITH OUR CHILDREN.

AND SHE DOESN'’’T MI
ND YOU TAKING ANOTHER
WOMAN TO LUNCH?

NOT AT ALL.

DOES YOUR FIANCEÉÉ MIND
YOU GOING TO LUNCH
WITH ME?

YEAH. I DON'’’T THIN
K HE'’’D BE TOO CRAZY

ABOUT ME HAVING
LUNCH

WITH A HANDSOME
STRANGER IN PARIS.

NO.

D.
AND HE'’’S MY HUSBAN

I JUST FORGOT
TO WEAR MY RING.

IS THAT TERRIBLE?

YOU KNOW, I THINK
IN RELATIONSHIPS

THERE ARE THINGS
YOU ARE HONEST ABOUT

AND THINGS YOU CHOOSE
TO KEEP TO YOURSELF.

ARE YOU GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS, AUDREY?

I HAVE TO CALL
MY FRIEND.

CAN I BORROW YOUR
CELL PHONE, PLEASE?

[MUFFLED VOICES]

[DOOR OPENS]

[AUDREY SIGHS]

SORRY I'’’M LATE.

WHAT'’’S GOING ON
HERE?

WHAT HAPPENED?

NORA, WHAT HAPPENED?

DID WE GET ROBBED
OR SOMETHING?

I LOST THE PIECE
OF PAPER

WITH JULIAN'’’S
NUMBER ON IT.

WHAT?

I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

IT'’’S GONE.

OK. WE'’’LL FIND IT.

YOU DON'’’T UNDERSTAND.

I LOOKED EVERYWHERE
20 TIMES.

WELL, I'’’LL LOOK AGAIN
WITH FRESH EYES, OK?

WHAT ABOUT
THE PHONE BOOK
OR INFORMATION?


HIS LAST NAME
IS DURAND.

IT'’’S LIKE THE SMITH
OF FRANCE.

THEN I TALKED
TO THE CONCIERGE
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR.

I'’’VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

I EVEN CALLED GLEN.
HE WASN'’’T THERE.


ARE YOU OK?

WELL, I WANT TO
FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

ALL RIGHT.

THIS.

I'’’M GONNA GO TAKE
A SHOWER.

I'’’LL BE BACK.

OK.

[SHOWER RUNNING]

Audrey: I'’’M SORRY
ABOUT TODAY.

YOU CALLED.

TOMORROW
WILL BE FUN.

THANKS FOR COMING
WITH ME.

I LOVE YOU, NORA.

I LOVE YOU, TOO.

GOOD NIGHT.

GOOD MORNING.

WHOA. YOU'’’RE
PRETTY CHIPPER TODAY.

YEAH. THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

I CAME HERE TO
SURPRISE SOME GUY
I HARDLY KNOW

THAT I CAN'’’T FIND,
BUT SO WHAT?

WE'’’RE IN PARIS.

YEAH. WE'’’VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO THIS.

YEAH. SO LET'’’S
JUST ENJOY IT.

IT'’’S TIME I GOT MY
SENSE OF HUMOR BACK.

GOOD FOR YOU.

I THINK WE SHOULD
STILL LOOK AROUND TOWN

FOR YOUR MYSTERY MAN.

YOU NEVER KNOW.
WE MAY RUN INTO HIM.

YEAH. WHAT DO I
HAVE TO LOSE
AT THIS POINT?

NOTHING.

PLUS WE CAN GO
SHOPPING.

RIGHT.


Audrey: OHH.
I CAN'’’T BELIEVE

IT'’’S RAINING
IN PARIS.

I CAN'’’T BELIEVE
I THOUGHT I'’’D FIND
JULIAN IN THESE PLACES

UNLESS HE'’’S
INTO WOMEN'’’S CLOTHES.

DO YOU WANT TO GET
A TEA OR SOMETHING?

A TEA?

THAT'’’S FUNNY.

HA HA HA!

THANK YOU.
MERCI.

DID YOU SEE WHAT
WAS IN THE PACKAGE?

JUST SOME
BUSINESS PAPERS.

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

NO. NOTHING
TOO EXCITING.

THE OLD LADY WAS
REALLY COOL.

SHE THOUGHT I WAS
HER GRANDDAUGHTER.

GOD. THAT KIND OF THING
ONLY HAPPENS TO YOU, NORA.

HA HA!

AHH.

MARK CALLED
THIS MORNING.

HE SAID HE MISSED ME.

WANTED TO KNOW
IF I WANTED TO WORK
ON OUR RELATIONSHIP.

DO YOU?

I SUPPOSE.

I MEAN, I GUESS
I JUST SHOULDN'’’T THROW
MY MARRIAGE AWAY

WITHOUT TRYING.

I MEAN, I DO
REALLY LOVE HIM.

MAYBE I JUST SHOULDN'’’T
BE SO CRITICAL

JUST BECAUSE THINGS AREN'’’T
IN THE GREATEST PLACE,

YOU KNOW?

I THINK THAT'’’S
GREAT, AUDREY.

OK.

LET'’’S DO IT.

AUDREY...

I KNOW I'’’M CRAZY,

BUT I THINK I'’’M
GONNA STAY.

[DROPS SUITCASE]

NORA, I AM
YOUR FRIEND,
AND I LOVE YOU,

BUT THIS JUST ISN'’’
T WORKING OUT.

YOU GOT TO
GIVE THIS UP.

I CAN'’’T.

YOU GO.

I KNOW MARK IS
WAITING FOR YOU.

NORA, YOU HAVE
NO SENSE
OF DIRECTION,

AND YOU ARE
WAY TOO SHY.

DO YOU WANT ME TO
STAY WITH YOU?

BECAUSE I WILL.

NO. I HAVE TO DO
THIS FOR MYSELF.

I HAVE TO STOP RELYING
ON OTHER PEOPLE

TO MAKE DECISIONS
FOR ME.

YOU'’’RE GONNA COME
HOME, AREN'’’T YOU?

YEAH. I HAVE NO JOB
AND NO MONEY.

I HAVE TO COME BACK
TO REALITY SOON.

WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

I DON'’’T KNOW.

SOMETHING I FEEL LIKE
DOING, I GUESS.

WELL, I'’’M REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

I GOT TO GO.

I KNOW.

OK.

I'’’LL CALL YOU.

YOU WEIRDO.

[NO AUDIO]

[SPEAKING FRENCH]

I DON'’’T SPEAK
FRENCH.

AH. I SAID,
"IT MAKES ME
WANT TO CRY."

YOU ARE AMERICAN?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN PARIS?

JUST LOOKING.
JUST LOOKING?

YOU LIKE ART.

[KNOCK ON WINDOW]

AH. I GO
WITH MY FRIENDS.

WE GO HAVE
A COFFEE.

YOU WANT TO COME
WITH US?

NO, THANK YOU.

OK. WELL, IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND,

WE'’’LL BE JUST
ACROSS THE STREET, OK?

OK.
I'’’LL SEE
YOU THERE.

[MAN SPEAKING FRENCH]

[SPEAKING FRENCH]

AH, SI, SI.
EH, COME, COME.

HI.
HI.

SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.

WHAT'’’S YOUR NAME?

NORA.
NORA, HI.

I'’’M GUILLAUME.
GUILLAUME.

THIS IS SEÉÉBASTIEN.

NICE TO MEET YOU.

AND THAT'’’S KARIM.
ENCHANTEÉÉ.

WOULD YOU LIKE
A GLASS OF WINE?

YES?

LET'’’S TOAST.

[SPEAKS FRENCH]

NO, NO, NO.
NO CROSSING.

GO FIRST.

AND THEN
THE OTHERS.

VOILAÁÁ!

IS THAT CROSSING
IF I DO THAT?

NO.
NO, NO. THAT'’’S FINE.

IT'’’S DIRECT LINE.

WE DRINK NOW.
HA HA HA!

SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN PARIS, NORA?

I'’’M LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE.

AND DID YOU
FIND HIM?

NO. NO.

WELL, YOU'’’RE NOT
SO BAD RIGHT NOW.

NOT BAD.

ARE ALL FRENCH GUYS
LIKE THIS?

LIKE WHAT?

UM, PASSIONATE,
INTERESTED, UH...

MM-HMM.

ATTENTIVE

BUT KIND OF LIKE
DOGS, TOO?

NO, NO.
DOGS?

THE WOMEN--THE WOMEN
ARE THE ONES, YOU KNOW?

THE LAST TIME
I HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

ALL THE TIME
WE HAD SOME FIGHT.

SHE TRIED TO JUMP
OUT OF THE WINDOW
ALL THE TIME.

YEAH. HA HA!
NO.

THAT WAS SUPER-SCARY.
IT WASN'’’T FUNNY, YOU KNOW,

ESPECIALLY FOR ME.
SORRY.

THERE'’’S ONE, SHE TRIED
TO STOP ME.

YEAH, BUT THAT WAS
CRAZY, YOU KNOW.

IT'’’S TRUE.

DID YOU EVER THINK
THAT MAYBE YOU WERE
THE ONES

DRIVING THEM CRAZY?

NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DON'’’T THINK SO, NO.

NOT LIKE THIS.

BECAUSE I'’’VE HEARD
DIFFERENTLY.

YEAH?
YEAH.

BECAUSE
OF THE FRENCH MOTHERS.

WHAT, UH--WHAT
ABOUT THE FRENCH
MOTHERS?

THEY, UM, THEY'’’RE
IN LOVE WITH THEIR SONS.

AND THE AMERICAN
MOTHERS ARE NOT?

NOT AS MUCH.

I THINK BECAUSE
OF THE FOOD.

HERE YOU GO.

MERCI.

Bartender:
BONSOIR, MONSIEUR.

BONSOIR,
MADEMOISELLE.

BONSOIR.

ARE YOU AMERICAN?

YES. WHY?

BECAUSE YOU LOOK
A VERY BEAUTIFUL
AMERICAN WOMAN

SITTING ALONE
IN THIS BAR.

MAYBE I'’’M WAITING
FOR SOMEONE.

WELL, BUT YOU
LOOK ALONE.

NO?

MY NAME IS
JEAN PAUL CLAREMONT.

WHAT'’’S YOURS?

NORA WILDER.

NICE TO MEET YOU,
NORA.

NICE TO MEET YOU.

MAY I OFFER YOU
ANOTHER DRINK?

SURE. WELL,
AFTER THIS ONE.

CHEERS.

I MEAN, WHAT WERE
THE CHANCES THAT
I WOULD FIND HIM?

BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE FUNNY THING IS

AFTER A WHILE
I WASN'’’T EVEN
LOOKING FOR JULIAN.

I WAS JUST DOING
MY OWN THING,
AND IT FELT GOOD.

IT'’’S NOT WRONG
TO WANT SOMEONE
TO LOVE YOU.

MOST PEOPLE
ARE TOGETHER

JUST SO THEY
ARE NOT ALONE,

BUT SOME PEOPLE
WANT MAGIC.

I THINK YOU ARE ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE.

NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

NOTHING,
BUT IT DOESN'’’T
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

DOES IT EVER HAPPEN?

FIRST, NORA,
YOU MUST FIND LOVE

AND HAPPINESS
IN YOURSELF.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

I THINK SO.

OH. WE ARE
BOTH DRUNK.

I WILL PUT YOU
IN A TAXI TO YOUR HOTEL.

IT'’’S TIME TO GO.

Jean Paul: TOMORROW,
YOU WILL START
YOUR LIFE AGAIN.

I DON'’’T KNOW WHY,
BUT I WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU.

I'’’LL NEVER FORGET
YOU EITHER.

NEVER.

[TELEPHONE RINGING]

HELLO?

Audrey: HEY, NORA.
IT'’’S ME.

AUDREY, HI.

HOW'’’S IT GOING?

EVERYTHING'’’S OK.

I'’’M JUST LEAVING
FOR THE AIRPORT
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

WELL, DID YOU
FIND HIM?

NO, I DIDN'’’T,
BUT I'’’M ALL RIGHT.

REALLY?
YEAH, I REALLY AM.

OK. GOOD.

LISTEN. I GOT TO GO,
BUT I'’’LL CALL YOU

ON THE WAY
TO THE AIRPORT, OK?

OK. I MISS YOU.

OH, I MISS YOU, TOO.

FLY SAFE, OK?
OK.

ALL RIGHT. BYE.

BYE.

HI.

NORA.

.
I CAN'’’T BELIEVE IT

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

WELL, I'’’M--I'’’M GOING
TO A SOUND EXPO
AT LE BOURGET,

BUT WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

I--I'’’M GOING
TO THE AIRPORT.

WHAT TIME IS
YOUR FLIGHT?

IN 3 HOURS.

THEY MAKE YOU GET
TO THE AIRPORT
SO EARLY NOW.

[MAN SPEAKS FRENCH]

[JULIAN SPEAKS
FRENCH]

MERCI.

OK. I JUST WANT TO ASK
WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE.

DID YOU COME
TO SEE ME?

BECAUSE I DON'’’T
UNDERSTAND.

I LIKE YOU SO MUCH,

AND I NEVER HEAR
ANYTHING FROM YOU,

AND THEN YOU ARE
JUST HERE

IN FRONT OF ME NOW.

WHY?

IT'’’S REALLY
COMPLICATED.

OK, BUT TRY
TO EXPLAIN.

I CAME HERE
TO FIND YOU.

THEN I LOST
YOUR NUMBER.


YOU CAME HERE
TO SEE ME?

AND YOU NEVER
FIND ME?

BUT THEN YOU
FIND ME?

AND NOW YOU LEAVE?

SO YOU LIKE ME?

YES.

WOULD YOU STAY WITH ME
FOR ANOTHER DRINK?

BUT YOU KNOW YOU'’’RE
GONNA MISS YOUR FLIGHT?

I KNOW.
