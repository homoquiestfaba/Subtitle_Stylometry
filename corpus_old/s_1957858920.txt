<i>Code Blueâ€¦</i>


[nurse 2] What's going on?

then he started coding.

[nurse 2] I'll get the bag.
[nurse 3] What's going on, Charlie?

he went into V-tach, and then he coded.

Let's swap compressions.
[Charlie] Okay.

[nurse 3] In three, two, oneâ€¦

[nurse 2] Good swap.
[PA] <i>Section 12â€¦</i>

[nurse 2] Breath, two, three, fourâ€¦


I came in and saw he was seizing,

silenced the vent,
noticed he was in V-tach,

and then he went asystolic.

[nurse 2] Compressions.
[nurse 3] Watch out.

No epi yet.
He's about a minute into compressions.

Okay. Let's get the epi started, please,

and let's pause in a minute
for a pulse check.

[nurse 3] Copy that.

[nurse 2] Breath.

Quick compressions.

[nurse 3] 12, 13, 14, 15.
[nurse 2] Breath.

Breath, two.
[nurse 3] Two, three.

[nurse 2] Breath.
[nurse 3] Six, seven, eight, nine, tenâ€¦

Let's pause for a pulse check.

[nurse 3] 14, 15. No pulse.

Is that a shock able rhythm?
Yeah, it's shock able.

Uh, let's charge 150 joules.
[nurse 3] Charging.

[nurse 2] Breath.
[nurse 3] Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Keeping compressions.

Clear for the shock.
[nurse 2] You all clear?

And let's call his wife.

[eerie string music playing]

[string chords wail]

[music fades]

[clunking, metallic scraping]


[indistinct PA announcement]

[chatter]
[machines beeping steadily]

[patient groans softly]
[nurse] Almost there.


How long have you two been married?
Three years.

Wow. Couple o'Â newlyweds.

[man chuckles]

You know, baby, I love you so much.

All right. I have got it.

[man] All right.
[patient] Oh.


Can we get her some water, please?

Sorry, she can't have any until tomorrow.
She still might choke.

But here.

This is gonna make her feel better.

I have to go, but I'll be back.
No. No, you can't go.

I'm not allowed to stay.

Hey, Sam, this chair reclines.

You want a blanket and pillow?


Okay. I won't tell if you don't.

I'll be right back.
Thanks.

You've pushed a liter.
I don't understand why his pressure's low.

They don't know, but they want
another set of labs at midnight.

Okay, what about Holly?

Holly is stable,
but they still need to get...

Amy.

I'd like to have a word with you
about 310.

Jeez.

You let a relative sleep over?

An old man, yeah.
He was exhausted, and it was 1:00 a.m.

We don't have the staff
to run a hotel for relatives.

Management has got me
rationing coffee filters.

Every penny is like a freaking prisoner.

I had to beg Linda Garran for extra staff.

Right.

But I got nights some help, okay?

A new guy, tons of experience,
great recommendations.

Oh.
[phone rings]

Great.

You're welcome.
[phone rings]

It's Viv.
[door closes]

[machines beeping, whirring]

Hey, Holly, it's Amy.

All right,
I'm just gonna turn you a little bit.

Just put this arm down.

Hey, I ran into your sister
when I started my shift.

She's so nice. Did you guys
have a good time together?

I can't believe she's got twins.

I don't know howâ€¦

She does that.

Okay.

One, two, three. [strains]




Ahâ€¦

[breathes shakily]

[breathes deeply]

[inhales sharply]


[chatter on radio]

[unsettling music playing]

[radio turns off]

How was the fried chicken?
Did you do the paper bag shake?

Yeah, I did the whole thing.
Whatever Julia Child said, I did.

[both laugh]

[Amy] Amazing.
Umâ€¦

Uh, I thinkâ€¦ you still owe me
for last Friday.

Butâ€¦ But it can wait, really.

Oh no! I'm sorry.


I'm such an idiot.

Okay, 20, 40â€¦
Listen, you really don't have to do this.

I don't need it all.
Six, sevenâ€¦ No, no, no. Eight, nineâ€¦

Come on. Here, take it.
There's 50. Sorry about that.

Thank you. I'm sorry too.
It's yours.

[girl 1] Come on, Mr. Teddy.
We're going to school!

I think we talked about Mr. Teddy
not going to school before.

[girl 2] Thanks, Mom.
Come here, Mr. Bag.

[girl 2] I'm ready.

Bye.
[Amy] Have the best day.

[girl 1] Bye!
[Amy] Love you!

You need some milk, by the way.
Okay. I'll get it.

See you later.
Thanks.

[door closes]


[machine beeps steadily]

Hmm.

we were hoping for.

Hmm.

How bad we talkin'?

If you continue like this,

you're looking at a serious
coronary incident within months,

which could be fatal.

At the last appointment,
you said that there were options.

I know, but that was
before we got these results.

This is now about
keeping your heart going long enough.

For what?

To get you on the transplant list.

And you'll have to stop working,
take medical leave.

I can't. I need health insurance,

and I don't get paid leave
until I've been there a year.


You have kids, right?

Mm-hmm.

Well, you're at high risk for a stroke.

You should make them aware
of the symptoms.

The early warning signs of an episode
are breathlessness, pressure in the chest,

feeling weak or faint.

You need to tell them in case
something should happen at home. Okay?

Hi. Loughren.
[receptionist] Mm-hmm.

I'm checking out.


So I see you're not covered?
Nope.

and consultation, it'll be $980.

Umâ€¦

Can I split it in two?

Sure thing.

[rain patters]

[woman over speaker]
<i>Maria, can you turn me up? Watch TV.</i>

<i>â€¦vitamin D. Thank you.</i>

[machines beeping, whirring]

Hey.
Oh.

You the new guy?
Ah, yeah, Charlie.

Hi, Charlie. Amy.

Oh, hey, Amy.
Nice to meet you.

Welcome.
Thank you.

Did anyone give you the tour yet?
Uh, no, not yet.

I got my patients, but, umâ€¦
Okay, come on, let me show you around.

The computer's free for all.

There's a code to access the bathroom,
very importantly,

the highly original codeÂ 4321.

Uncrackable.

Ha!

Uh, you ever work with PYXIS?

Yeah, but I think
we had the '97 model. The, umâ€¦

Huh, okay, come on. Let me show you.

Put in your nurse ID.

And then your code.

You put in what you need.

And the amount.


Take it out. One, two, three, four, five.
Close the drawer.

Got it?
Yeah.

Uh, they said you had a lot of experience.
Where'd you work at before?

I've been all over, really.

Florians, Vance, Shawlands, St. Aloysius.
Shawlands.

A girl I trained with works at Shawlands.

Oh, yeah?
Lori.

Lucas?
Yes.

Yeah, we worked together a lot.
She's great. She's an amazing nurse.

I haven't talked to her forever.

call her "Pocket Rocket"?

No. Oh my God. That's hilarious.

I shouldâ€¦ I'll call her up
and ask her about that.

Oh God. Please don't.
Don't tell her I told you that. [chuckles]

Who'd they give you tonight?

Uhâ€¦ Who did they give me?

I have 311, uh, Stevens. 310,Â Martinez.

Do you know their first names? You guys,
you don't put 'em on the doors here.

You're like me.
First names are always better.

Ana. Let's start with her.
Ana.

She presented to the ED
with an adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

Kicker is the prescription
was her husband's,

so insurance is gonna try
to screw them over

if we give 'em a chance.

So how's the skin?
Sloughing off at this point.

And what, so clears only?

Yeah. First sip tonight.
Come on. I'll introduce you.

Water later.

Well, hey there, lovebirds.


Look what I brought.
Hey.

Here you go.


Is that the best thing
you have ever tasted?

Yeah.
Mm-hmm?

[Amy] There you go.
[chokes]

Let's start slow, all right?

I wanna introduce you to Charlie.
Hey.

He's gonna be your nurse this evening,
but, you know, I'm around if you need me.

Okay?

Soâ€¦
How you doing, Sam? Good?

You let me know when you've had enough.


Okay, is it burning? It burns? Okay.
I'll check in in a bit.

Well, let's take a pause, okay?

So, umâ€¦ tell me, I heard
you had a rough couple of days. Yeah?

Well, you guys just push on the button
if you need anything.

Anytime, I'm here.
I'm your Amy for tonight.

[both chuckle]

[machines beeping, whirring]

[knocks twice]
Hey.

Hey.

Uh, so mine are all settled,

so I was just gonna go to the cafeteria,
grab some food.

You want something?
Sorry. Cafeteria closes at 11:00.

I should've told you that.
Oh shit. No problem. I'm not that hungry.

Sorry.
No. I'll hit up the vending machines.

Hey, you know what? You like eggs?
Uhâ€¦

I have a large questionableâ€¦ [chuckles]
â€¦egg salad that I'd prefer to share.

You know, safety in numbers.
I'm fine, thank you.

No, no. I'll bring it to the desk
when I'm finished with Holly here.

You sure?
Yeah.

'Kay, thanks.

I like the croutons.

Mm, you mean the soggy crackers?
That's what they are?

That's the real delicacy of the salad.

Yeah. My eldest daughter made it.

She comes from a long line of women
who can't cook.

What, so your husband cooks?

No, it's just me and my girls.

Oh. I have two girls.

Uhâ€¦ Four and seven.

Mine are five and nine.

Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

I don't live with mine anymore though.
Their mom moved, like, six hours away, soâ€¦

That's kinda why I'm here.

Well, I think this is great.
[chuckles]

Okay.
[alert beeping]

Oh, he's...
307.

Yep. Steven. I have about
one minute before he pees.

I got it.

You sure? Thanks.

Hey, Steven. I'm Charlie.
I'm afraid Amy's busy right now, soâ€¦

Can I help? A little problem?

[patient chats indistinctly]


Look.
[woman] So what? You don't even like her.

[girl] I do! She's my friend, Jackie!
[Jackie] Nobody's gonna notice that.



why I have to keep using these.


It's such crap!

Stop it! What's going on here?
You ruined my shoes!

I did not! I tried to help you.

Would you mind sitting with Maya?
No, you obviously didn't, Jackie!

She's in the...
That's okay.

Why the hell
are you yelling at Jackie?

She glued the bottom back on.
It's not a big deal, Alex.

I can scrape it off.
You told her to.

Look, it comes right off.

But it's on both shoes.
See? I can take it off.

I'll just...
No, you can't.

Calm down. It's not the end of the world.

No.

Wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. I know.
Stop...

I'm trying, okay? I know you don't have
as much as your friends, but I'm try...

I don't get anything!

I don't even get to have you.
I'm sorrâ€¦

[door slams]

Oh fuck.


[inhales deeply]

[exhales deeply]

[machines beeping, clicking]

[troubling music playing]

[patient moans softly]

[bed rails clicking]

[breathes shakily]

[breathes heavily]

[breathing erratically]




What's going on? You okay?


Okay, well, I'll just sit here
until you feel better, okay?

Now breathe with me.

[inhales deeply]

[exhales deeply]

[both inhale and exhale deeply]

Keep breathing.

[Amy's voice shakes]



Blood blisters onâ€¦ on my heart.

Okay. So why are you working?

I don't have health insurance.

What about here?

Did you speak to a cardiologist?
No, please.

Okay.

Don't tell them.

I'll get fired.
Okay.

I'm not gonna tell anyone.

Okay.
Yeah.

How much longer do you need to work here
before you get your insurance?

Four months.

Okay.

I can help you.

Come on.


You can do four months.

[wheezes, laughs]

You're gonna be okay.

Yeah?

Are you cold?
Mm-hmm.

Here.

[gentle music plays]

[emergency brake clicks]

[car door handle clicking]

Something's wrong with the door.
Oh, it's this.

Ah. [chuckles] Thanks.

It's gonna be a long night.
Speaking of energy, how was the park?

She canceled.
No!

Yeah. Moved it to next week.
Oh, that's hard.

Called just as I was
about to pick up the girls.

Yeah.

Kind of expected it, to be honest.

Uh, one sec.

Hey, what's up? Where's Sonya?

What have we got?

She had a family thing,
so I said I'd do her handover.

Uh, 310â€¦
Yeah.

â€¦expired right at shift change.

Ana?
[Viv] Yes. Mrs. Martinez.

Don't ask. I don't know what happened.

The husband was called. He's on his way.

309, he went sideways at around noonâ€¦

Ana died.

Respiratory came up. They tubed himâ€¦

[rain pattering]
[plastic crinkling]

like this?

My mom died in a hospital
when I was a kid.

When I got there to see her, it wasâ€¦

Well, first of all, they lost the body.

No.
Yeah. Insane. Just for a couple of hours.

But, you know, and then
when they did find her, it was this.

She was, like, you know,
half uncovered, nakedâ€¦ Total mess.

For the longest time, that was the memory.
That was how I thought of her.

Oh, Charlie.

So, for me, this is the important part.

Yeah.

Find some dignity.

[knocking on door]

Mr. Martinez is out there.

He would really like
to speak with you, Amy.

Go.

You good?
Yeah, I got this.

[somber music playing]

[no audible dialogue]22

[liquid drips]

[man 1] All right,
so give me the story again.

[man 2] All right, let me see.
Suspicious death of Mrs. Martinez, Ana.

Presented to the emergency room
with adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

All right, so?
Reacts to some antibiotic. What else?

They're not sure.

They don't know what killed her?
No.

[radio chatter]

How old was she?

Seventy-seven.

Seventy-seven.

So why are we here?

[car door slams]

[distant sirens wailing]

[woman 1] <i>The conference room's</i>
<i>right this way.</i>

[woman 2] Detectives,
Braun, Baldwin, welcome.

I'm Linda Garran, risk manager.

This is Duncan Beattie, attorney.

Our board.

You two might know Malcolm Burrel
from the City Council.

I am a huge supporter of the local force
and the district attorney.

Ah, well, nice to meet you all.

Okay, well, we don't know much.

Just that there's been a death.

An unexplainable incident
in which the patient expired.

Okay. Unexplainable how?

Well, it's the opinion
of the medical experts

that this was an unusual
adverse reaction to medications.

But we found absolutely nothing
to suggest this was intentional.

Then why call us?

We didn't think this was a police matter,

but the Department of Health dictates
when we should reach out,

and here we are.

What are the medications?

Umâ€¦ Well, all are listed.



It's quite a complicated document.

I'll take my chances.

Well, if youâ€¦ if you turn
to the third page,

you can see the window in which
patient I had abnormal laboratory results

and life-threatening symptoms.

Where's Mrs. Martinez's body?

Uh, released to the family.

They put a lawsuit together?

We don't believe that the family are aware

of the unusual circumstances
around patient 1's expiration.

Isn't that something
you should've disclosed to them?

It was an evolving situation.

Park field rightly sought legal counsel

to make sure
everything was done correctly.

Okay, but Mrs. Martinez's body is where?
How do we get it?

It's our understanding
the family have cremated her.

When did she die?

Seven weeks ago.

We were conducting
an internal investigation.

Hence the lag.

Okay.

Well, of course we'll need to interview
all the staff that works in the ICU.

Make way, make way.
I am an important person of the town.

In fact, I am <i>the</i> most important person
of the town,

if not the most important person
west of the Pecos.

[Charlie and Maya] "Wherever that is!"

I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

"So, what do you do?"

"Do"? I don't do anything. I'm the mayor.

Okay. [chuckles]

"Well, you have to do something now."

"This may be just a one-horse town
without the horse,

but it's been invaded by aliens."

I'll have to look it up
in my book of <i>How to be Mayor.</i>

One. You get to wear a fancy chain.

Two. You get driven around in a big car
by your very own chauffeur.

Threeâ€¦


Om nom!

You eat. It'sâ€¦

"Three. You eat and drink for fr..."

I'm never gonna get this part!
Don't get frustrated, honey.

Are you kidding? This is great, Alex.

No, and the teacher said that I should
wear a suit and have a mustache.

Dress like a man because I'm the mayor.
He said a girl mayor would be weird.

Women can be mayors.

I told him that, but...

It's a play about an alien invasion,
and the female mayor's the weird part?

Screw that guy.
[chuckles]

[Jackie] I'm here!
[Amy] Hey!

[Maya] Jackie!
No! You can't go yet.

Oh, sorry, kiddo.
[Jackie] Come on, sweetheart.

Come here.
[Jackie] Guess what I brought you.

Okay, take my hands.

Repeat after me.

I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.



They send over
that internal investigation yet?

Oh, not yet. They say they need more time
to compile all the relevant files.

Seven weeks wasn't enough of a head start?

You'd think.

You want me to

go through the staff?

Already did.

One of the nurses
had a criminal trespass charge

over in Pennsylvania.

Oh yeah? A nurse?

Yeah, a male nurse.
Charles Cullen. C-U-L-L-E-N.

Huh. When?

Uh, eight years ago.

What district was it in Pennsylvania?
Palmer.

[dial tone drones]
[buttons clack]

[line dials]

<i>- Palmer Police Department.</i>
Hello, ma'am.

I'm Detective Braun with Homicide
in the Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey.

I need some background
on a guy you picked up there in '95.

Could you pull the case jacket for me?

<i>- Do you have a name for me?</i>
It's Charles Cullen.

<i>- Oh, there's a Post-it note on the file.</i>
There's a Post-it note on the file.

She's not sure if it's supposed to
be there. Can you spell that?

<i>It says "digoxin."</i>

Digoxin? What is that?
A medicine or something?

[indistinct response]
[chuckles]

Uh, you got anything else on him?

<i>Picked up for trespassing andâ€¦</i>

Okay. Picked up for trespassing
and harassment in '95.

Says he slashed a coworker's tires
after they broke up.

<i>The charges were dropped.</i>

What's that?
<i>- Yep, all charges.</i>

Charges were dropped?

<i>- Yeah.</i>
Oh.

Okay, thanks so much.

<i>- Yep.</i>
Bye-bye.

Something's not right.

Park field waited almost two months
to report it.

Internal investigation
you don't wanna share.

Expensive lawyers.

Okay.

Wellâ€¦

What possible reason could they have
for covering up a death?

Right? What are the motives?

It's a business. There's never
a better motivation than money

when it comes to that shit, right?

[mic feeds back]
[clears throat]

Hello? You can keep eating.

We won't take up too much of your time.

We just wanna make you aware
of an event the hospital is looking into.

We wanted to assure you all
that the board and I

are dealing with the incident
and everything connected to it.

But we thought it best
to bring you all together,

make everyone universally aware
that the police are also involved.

And that...
What is this about?

Uh, there's been an issue
with a patient's death in the ICU.

Was the death suspicious?
I mean, if the police are investigatingâ€¦

I wanna be clear. <i>We</i> are investigating
with the assistance of the local police.

Do you know which patient?
No.

that outside investigation is involved,

uh, Mr. Beattie, our attorney, is here,

and he would like
to say something as well.

Thanks.

Yes, uh, I just wanna say

that I'll be discussing
with each of you individually,

but as a blanket statement to all,

I just wanna say that in times like this,

patient confidentiality
has to be an absolute priority.

Your individual contracts
are very precise when it comes to this.

Anyone speaking to the police

without a representative
of the hospital present

would be in breach of their contract.

[crowd murmurs]

[clears throat] So at the end of the day,
Mr. Beattie and I are here for you.

Uh, we wanna be present
for any interviews,

because we have
your best interests at heart.

You have full access,
but she's gotta be in the room.

No. Absolutely not. She can't be in there.

That lady's the risk manager.
It's her job to be in there.

Who's gonna talk
if their boss is in the interview?

We don't even know what happened.
We don't even have a body.

The only condition that they asked for
is that she be in the room

and that you don't talk specific
about medications.

I understand them asking for it,
but why did you give it to them?

You're supposed to be the prosecutor.

As far as I can see,

they're cooperating fully
with your investigation.

This is all we have. Is this cooperation?


They're getting the documents together.
It's done. They're sending it first thing.


Why would Park field
conduct an internal investigation,

a seven-week internal investigation,

then call us in
and put her in the room if it was nothing?

Due diligence.

I'm shutting it down. She's in the room.

Done.


[door opens]

Hi, Amy.

Hi. [clears throat]

Nurse Loughren.

This is Officer Braun, Baldwin.
How you doin'?

What is this about?
[Garran] Just some informal questions.

The officers are speaking
to a number of staff in the ICU.


Do you remember Ana Martinez?

Yeah, Ana was my patient.

Do you recall anything odd
about what happened to her?

Odd?


Yeah, and it was very sad. It was sudden.

Sudden?

Well, patients die in the ICU, butâ€¦

We didn't expect it.

[knocking on door]

[door opens]

I don't mean to interrupt.
Can I see you for a minute?

Excuse me. I'll be right back.

This better be important.
I wanted no interruptions.

You see any deviations there?

Mm-mm.

Wait, yeah. Her glucose.

It's, uhâ€¦

Yeah, the blood sugars, it's wrong.

Uh, there's no C-peps.

That's weird.
What does that mean?

Uh, it means that the insulin
in her system wasn't made in her body.

Someone gave it to her.

So you can tell from that
that she was given insulin?

Well, it's not on the list,
and, you know, she's, uhâ€¦ not diabetic,

so the insulin would've been
a double medication error,

which is really rare, soâ€¦

A double medication error? It's rare?

Yeah.

Would that have killed her?
Sure.

[footsteps approach]


[door closes]
[Garran] Where were we?

Uh, let's see. Oh.

Can you tell us anything
about your coworkers?

You don't mind if she answers a question
about a colleague, do you, Ms. Garran?

Of course not.
[Braun] Good

that you work with a Charlie Cullen.

[Amy] Yeah.
Could he be involved in this?

I think you're jumping
to conclusions there, Officer.

Charlie wasn't there.

I mean, Ana died on the day shift.
Charlie and I both work nights.

We have no reasons to suspect
it was anything other than an accident.

Thank you, Amy.

I know Charlie really well.

We work every shift together,
and he's a very good nurse.

He wouldn't have made a mistake like that.

Thank you, Amy.

So where's that internal investigation?
We're still reviewing everything.

Well, we don't need you to review it.
We'll just take it as it is.

I'll instruct the team
to send you the boxes tomorrow.

But I hope you can deduce
that, umâ€¦ it's been a tough seven weeks.

Eight.

It's been eight weeks.

[frantic beeping]
[doctor 1]Â Jack Ivins. July 19, '88.

Recovering from gallbladder surgery
on Thursday. There was no complications.


[doctor 2] Gonna need you to get ready
to do another shock, 150 joules.

Everybody clear.
[doctor 3] Clear.

[doctor 2] Deliver the shock. Shock.

Resume compressions.

[doctor 4] One and two and three and four
and five and sixâ€¦

[doctor 2] Compressions.
Nine, ten, 11, 12, 13â€¦

[doctor 2] Hold compressions.
Let's check for a rhythm.

[doctor 3] I got nothing.
[doctor 2] Persistent V-fib.

Resume compressions.

Let's get one milligram
of epinephrine IV started.

[doctor 3] Six, seven, eight, nine, tenâ€¦

[doctor 2] Let's get prepared
to give it another shock, 200 joules.

[doctor 1] Epi ready. In line.

[doctor 2] Continue your breathing.

[doctor 3] Twenty.
[doctor 1] Keep your compressions.

[doctor 3] Talk to me.

[doctor 2] Is that epi ready?
[Amy groans]

Swap in, five, four, three, twoâ€¦

[gasping for breath]
[doctor 3] You're all clear.

Oxygen's clear.
[defibrillation thumps]

[doctor 1] I'm moving in.
Low pulse, low pulse.

Shit, no pressure, still.
[continuous beep droning]

[doctor 2] Four and five and six and seven

and eight and nine, ten,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Shit.

Twenty-five. Now! Now!

[Amy gasps breathlessly]

[doctor 2, muffled] Let's go!

[high-pitched ringing]
[Amy breathes shakily]

[droning music playing]

[drawer closes]

[water runs]

Take these.


[music fades]


So there's a fault in the PYXIS.

So if you cancel a request late enough,
it opens anyway.

That's stealing meds, Charlie.

Amy, stop. Now, please don't worry.
I'm gonna help you get through this.

[pensive music playing]

[keys tapping]


Hey, what did he say?

I think you probably do need to tell Alex,

just in case something happens
and I'm not there.

They don't have anyone but me.
I can't leave them.

No, you're not leaving them, Amy.

That's not happening.
It'sâ€¦ What is it? Two months?

Okay, so I'm gonna help you do this.

Get your surgery, be with your girls.
That's what's happening.

Okay?

But I think you should tell Alex.

[plane whirring overhead]

butâ€¦ it really isn't.

have these ventricles.

They're just these spaces.
Yeah.

They're two little spaces
like balloons that fill with blood.

They move the blood around the body.
Mm-hmm.

And umâ€¦ mine, they just, you know,

they're too big,
and they just got a little thin.

But I am gonna be okay.
I've got medication.

I have doctors taking care of me,
and I'm gonna feel normal soon.

But your mom's gonna need our help, Alex.

If she were to fall
or, um, you know, start speaking funny,

or you struggle to wake her or something,

then you justâ€¦
you put Maya in front of the TV,

you call 911, and then you call me.

Yeah, but that's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.


I'm gonna be okay.

Can I just go watch some TV?

Okay.

But I'll be here if you wannaâ€¦


C-U-L-L-E-N.

[man 1] <i>Sure. Give me a second</i>
<i>while I pull up his records.</i>

Great, thanks.

[easy-listening hold music playing]

[man 1] <i>Okay, I just need</i>
<i>to check something with my boss.</i>

Okay. Sure.

[hold music resumes]


[man 2] <i>Hello?</i>

Hello. Detective Braun here.
Uh, who am I talking to?

<i>Mark Rossi.
Attorney for St. Aloysius Hospital Group.</i>

Mr. Rossi, hi.
I'm hoping you can help me out.

I'm looking for some information
on one of your former employees

from back in '96, Charles Cullen.

<i>Our employee data
is treated with strict confidentiality.</i>

I'm just looking to confirm his dates
of employment, not much more than that.

<i>We'd be happy to release
any relevant information</i>

<i>as soon as we see your subpoena.</i>

Okay, yep, thank you so much.

<i>Thank you.</i>

This is a fucking joke.

Whenever they hear his name,
no one wants to say anything.

Detective Baldwin?

Yeah.
It's from Park field Memorial Hospital.


Just need you to sign here.
All right.

Need a hand with the boxes?
No, it's just this.

[delivery man]Â Have a great day.

[ominous music playing]

Ms. Garran.
Detective Baldwin.

Oh, thank you for seeing me.

Anything to help wrap this up.

So, I just have a couple of questions.

The "Pixie" report.
You have all the drug withdrawals...

Uh, PYXIS.

That's right.

Uh, so you've got all
of the, um,Â drug withdrawals

for all of the nurses on this?

That's correct.

Well, I was hoping
I could get the full report,

because this one only has a short window
around Ana's expiration.

I'm told it only stores the information
for four weeks.

Well, you must have gotten a copy
during the internal investigation, right?

I don't believe we did, no.

I mean, I can check, but, uhâ€¦
everything we had was sent to you.

You see, this is page nine,

so pages one to eight
gotta be around here somewhere.

Hmm.

Uh, I'll be sure to look into it.
[clicks pen]

Nurse Garran, it's looking a lot like
you're withholding some evidence here.

I'm not sure I follow...
Six pages. Where's the rest of it?

I'm sorry. Iâ€¦ I have another meeting,
and I can't shift it...

Oh, I'm not done.

I'm gonna reschedule with your office.

Sit down.

Excuse me...
Sit the fuck down!

[ominous music playing]

You know exactly what you're doing.

[door opens, closes]

[phone rings]
[chatter]

[Amy] Hey, guys.
[woman] Hey.

Um, I know you're not supposed
to have babies in here,

but I really didn't have
anyone else who could take her.

It's okay.
[man] Thank you.

[Amy] What's her name?
Vanessa.

Messy Nessie.

Messy Nessie?
[woman] Uh-huh.

Well, I have two girls, so I hear that.

Mm.
[Amy] How old is she?

Six months.

Oh. She sleeping through the night yet?

[laughs] No!
[Amy] She must be teething.

[woman] Oh, yeah.
[Amy] Uh-huh.

[all chuckle]

[woman groans]
[knocks on door]

Nurse Loughren? It's not urgent.
There's a Code Purple in 300.


What's a Code Purple?

It means pizza's arrived.
Do you want a slice?

Oh.

Well, I can't say no to pizza.

You can't.

Unfortunately, though,
you're gonna have to say no to pizza.

Okay.

But you are healing nicely,
and will be holding Vanessa in no time.

She told me to go fuck myself
15 times on the phone.

Oh my God.

That's not nice.

I haven't even told you the best part.

So now, to try and stop me
from seeing the girls,

she has made up a story
about me being mean to her dog.

I'm not kidding.
It gets better and better.

Honestly, the whole thing
would be hilarious if it wasn't true.

I'm sorry.

It's my own fault.

I picked a crazy.

[both chuckle]

[TV character 1] <i>Oh, you know,</i>
<i>it works for me.</i>

<i>I mean, it's not, likeâ€¦ quickly.</i>

[character 2] <i>Right.</i>
[character 1] <i>What did you say?</i>

[character 2] <i>Nothing. Nothing, bro.</i>

[character 1] <i>You said aâ€¦ word.</i>
[character 2] <i>I didn't.</i>

[Amy sighs]


Okay. Do you wanna get
your backpack and coat?

You want a ponytail for school?
[Alex] Sure.

Beautiful hair.

I wish we could stay home.

I wish that too.

Wanna get your jacket?
Yeah.

Love you.
Love you.

[TV continues indistinctly]

Anything new?

Umâ€¦

Yeah, there was a list
of all the medications

that were in Ana Martinez's system.

Insulin?
Yeah, and another one.

Get this. Digoxin.

Digoxin?
[door opens]


Are you serious?
Shit.

Screaming at her.

Malcolm BurrelÂ from City Council
just called.

Danny will be happy
to apologize to Mrs. Garran.

Well, too late. You've both been banned
from the hospital property.

What?

Can't ban us from the scene of a crime
that we're investigating.

[man] What crime?
[Baldwin] Homicide.

What do you have to back this up?

The files and an interview with a nurse

who was certain
that the victim was given insulin.

Victim, what victim?

Ana Martinez.

You have no body.

No body, no autopsy.
You know how this works.


[door slams]

Banned from the fuckin' hospital?

[machines beeping]

Tom called to check on you.

I cannot get over
how cute that little Vanessa is.

Who's Vanessa?

Kelly, do you know
where you are right now?

I need you to answer me, hon.

I'm at the hospital.

Which hospital?

Uhâ€¦

All right.

Squeeze my hands.

Come on. Squeeze my hands.

A little light.

Has Tom come by?

He called to check on you.

Hey, Tom, it's Amy from the hospital.
<i>- Hi, Amy. What's going on?</i>

I really think that you should come in.
There's been a change overnight.

I think you should come in
sooner rather than later.

Okay, see you soon.

I checked in with Beth.
She's still sleeping.

Jack's been pushing on his call button...
Oh my God.

What?

There's insulin in her system.

[machines beep intensely]
[alarm blares]


<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

[foreboding music playing]

[gentle music playing]

[exhales shakily]



Oh my God! Oh God!

No!
[Vanessa groans]



Oh my God!

[Amy, softly] It's okay.
[Vanessa coos]

[birds twittering]

Shit.

Hello. Sorry to bother you like this.

Yeah, no.

We need your help, Amy.

Look, I'm sorry, guys. Iâ€¦ Really,
I don't know what happened to her.

To who?

Kelly Anderson. Iâ€¦ I meanâ€¦

Who's Kelly Anderson?


Another double-medication error?

Was Cullen with Kelly Anderson?

This has nothing to do with Charlie.

How well do you know him?
Really well.


He's been at nine hospitals.

And none of 'em will talk to us.

What do you mean? I'mâ€¦

No. If something had happened,
he wouldn't have been able to get a job.

The hospital would have done something.
You'd think so.

Yeah.

They're stonewalling us.

You have to help us.

[door creaks]

Mom, are you coming?

Hey, honey. Yeah, I'll be in in a second.
Just wait inside, okay?

Okay.

My kid's here. Likeâ€¦

Okay. Here's my card.

Give me a call.
Maybe he's not who you think.

Have a nice day.


[ominous music playing]

[car doors close]



Do you need anything?
Mm-mm.

No?
I'm fine.

Okay. You let me know if you feel tired.

I'm not. I will. I feel good.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Okay.
Mm.

[machine beeping, whirring]

[eerie music playing]

[bell dings]
[pop music plays over speakers]

[bell jingles]


[Amy] Pocket Rocket!
Mm!


[Lori] It is so good to see you!
[Amy] I know. You look so good.

Really?
Yes! You look great.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

I feel exhausted.
[server] Hi there! You ready to order?

Oh, I'll have a cheese omelet.
Okay.

And what pairs best with that?
Chardonnay.

Oh. A large cold glass of dry chardonnay.

Okay.
I'll have the same.

Thanks.
Coming right up.

When was the last time
we were in this dive?

A long time ago. Like, at least a decade.

What?
Twelve years?

Ugh, Jesus.
[Amy chuckles]

I'm getting old.
[server] Here we go.

Thank you.

How's Paul?

Uh, we split up.

Oh shit.
I mean, it's not a big deal.

It was a long time ago,
and we share custody of the dogs.

[Lori chuckles]

We worked hard to come to that agreement.
I'm so glad that you called.

Mm! Me too. [chuckles]

Just, you know, I wanted toâ€¦
I wanted to ask youâ€¦

It'sâ€¦ It's a little weird.

I love weird.

But, umâ€¦ do you remember working
with someone named Charlie Cullen?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Why?

Well, I'm working with him
right now at Park field.

There was a rumor about him.

That he was responsible for a death.

That he OD'd someone.

Oh.

Uh, with what?

They found insulin
in the dead guy's saline bag.

They found it in a few.

Pinpricks in the ones in the store.

Somebody had dosed them
before they went out.

Why did they think it was Charlie?

They didn't.

But we used to get codes every night.
Sometimes two or three.

And then after he left,

we got, like, only one a month.

[ominous music playing]

You get a lot of codes?

[running footsteps echoing]

[ominous music building]


[footsteps recede]


Okay.

Oh God.


[music fades]

[machine beeping]


[groans softly]

Hmm.


[foreboding music playing]

Easy, easy.

You're okay. You're okay. It's okay.

Amy, it's okay.
[beeping speeds up]

You're in the ED. You're doing great.

I checked on the girls.
Jackie's with them.

I can go get 'em, bring 'em here.

[shudders] No.
No? Okay.

[machine beeping rapidly]

You want some water?

No?

Don't you ever scare me
like that again please.

[wheezily] I wanna leave.
[Charlie] I know, I know.

I get it.

We're not gonna let them find out.

Whereâ€¦ Where's the nurse?

Uh, don't worry.
Your last pressure looked pretty good.

Your heart rate's been below 80
for the last hour.

I saw the labs, and your troponin's high,
but it's trending down.

So you're good. You're okay.

You're lucky. Could've been a lot worse.

I wanna go home.
I know.

Okay.
[woman] Hey. Saw her heart rate blip up.

You awake?
[Charlie] Yeah...

Bring me a discharge form.

Hey. I don't think that's a good idea.
She should stay overnight.

Yeah, we got this.
I wanna leave AMA.

You sure?
[beeping rapidly]

I'll drive her home.
Make sure she's looked after. Thank you.

[long beep droning]
[Charlie] We're good. Thank you.

Hey.

[beeping stops]

[Amy groans]
Please, stop.


Give me your arm.

So you sure you don't want me to come in?

I'm happy to sleep on the couch. I canâ€¦

I can take the girls to school.
I don't wanna scare them.

Nothing's gonna happen.
I justâ€¦ I just need to sleep.

[parking brake clicks]
You're right.

Thanks, Charlie.
Yeah.

[door handle rattles]

But if you need anythingâ€¦

I'll call you.

Yeah?

It's a month, Amy.

We got this.

You're freezing. Go.

[Charlie strains]

Call me.

[eerie music playing]

It has to be a secret.

[inhales shakily]



No one can know.

I'll get fired.

Understood.

He does it in the storage roomâ€¦

Before it even goes out.

He injects the insulin into the bags,

and because it enters
the bloodstream slowly,

it could take hours
or even, you know, a day to kill someone.


So he's killing 'em
without ever touching 'em.

Could he put something other than insulin
inside those bags?

Yeah, any clear liquid
wouldn't be detected.

Is digoxin a clear liquid?

Yeah.


Okay, and the nurse you met with,
you think she'll talk to us?

No.

No, she'll lose her job.

at what we got here from Park field?

Where's the rest of it?

That's it. That's all we have.
That's all they gave us.

The PYXIS report's just two pages.

They said it only keeps the file
for four weeks.

No, it's a computer.

It keeps the information
for as long as it was installed. It'sâ€¦

I'll pull Charlie's PYXIS report
from the machine in my ward,

and we'll use that to prove
that he withdrew insulin

and digoxin when Ana died.

Yeah, see, the problem is
that Ana Martinez was cremated,

so we don't have an autopsy.

What we need is an actual body.

[ominous music playing]

[air hissing]

[machine buzzing]

[machine beeping, whirring]

[machine beeping more rapidly]

[printer buzzing]


from Kelly Anderson's husband

to dig up her body for examination.

From the autopsy, we know
that a combination of insulin and digoxin

were in Kelly's system
and led to her death

in the early hours of the 15th.

and then on the 14th at 20:47,

you see that Charlie took out
insulin and digoxin from the PYXIS.

And if you see Kelly's report,

her blood sugar just drops at 21:56,

so that is the insulin taking effect.

And there's slow arrhythmia at 22:15,

and that's digoxin.

So he was holding two murder weapons.
3:57 is the time of death.

Everything's there.

Wait a second. Hold on.

With this PYXIS, it says cancellations,
not withdrawals.

Well, it's a fault in the system.

So when you cancel at the last minute,
the drawer opens,

but it reports it as a cancellation.

And Cullen knows about that?

Yeah, and I saw him do it.

Insulin, digoxin.
There's hundreds of orders here.

Okay, but not according to this.
This makes it look like he never got 'em.

But he did.

Did you actually see him do this?

[Baldwin groans]

Guys, this is the smoking gun right here.

Yeah, but this isn't.

It's just cancellations.
There's nothing nefarious.

There's no proof of guilt. There's...

Okay, he's been doing this
since he started at Park field, so look.

Look at all
of these repeated cancellations, right?

Look. They're not followed up
with a correct order.

He's had repeated orders
of vec and digoxin.

I mean, it's really...
It just screams wrong. It'sâ€¦

Maybe. Maybe Park field
just didn't understand.

Come on, guys.
Linda Garran used to be a nurse.

She understood.

Oh yeah, she knows,
and she's not doing anything.

[door opens]

[phones ringing in distance]

[door closes]

for coming in on your day off.

Hi, you can call me Charlie.

[ominous music playing]

Uhâ€¦ We've come across something troubling.

What hospital were you employed at
before you took the position here?

St. Elizabeth's.

And what were your dates
of employment there?

Uhâ€¦

I'm not sure.
Is there an issue from St. Elizabeth's?

'Cause I was targeted by some coworkers.
I don't know. Maybe they're at it again.

What we're concerned with are the dates
you listed on your application.

Do you remember what they were?

Umâ€¦

June '01 to August '03, maybe.

Yes, that's what you wrote.
Right.

Those dates are incorrect, Mr. Cullen.

Oh.

St. Elizabeth's confirmed with us
that you were employed from May,

so these discrepancies
on your application form

leave us with no option but to let you go

with immediate effect.

Wait, so you're firing me for writing
the wrong dates on my application?

Itâ€¦ It is in the contract.

Well, I believe I need to sign something.

[Charlie sniffs]

Is that all?

That's all.

Thank you, Mr. Cullen.

[door opens]

[door closes]


[door opens]

[door closes]

I just got news from Park field.
They've dealt with the Cullen issue.

What does that mean?
He's been fired.

What?
So they're just gonna let him go?

Well, what did they say?

That they fired him because they found
some discrepancy in his paperwork.

Well, what was his state of mind?
Was he stable?

Wait, you don't think that this could
make him more dangerous, do you?

At least he can't be
anywhere near patients.

He can't hurt anyone.

He's been at nine hospitals. Nine.

What don't you understand?

They all say the same thing.
They cover up their own liabilities.

It happens again and again and again.

He's gonna get a new job
at another hospital,

and it's all gonna continue.

You allowed this.


Don't look at me.

You did.

[kids chat indistinctly]

Jackie, I'm back.
[Alex] Maya.

[Maya] Oh my God!
[Alex] Maya! Can you just say your line?

Hey, girls.


Wow.

[kids continue chatting]

What?


[Alex] I don't have the script.
Oh my God.


so many times!

Okay, Alex, be nice to your sister.

over Charlie's part again.

What are you doing here?

Rehearsing.

Where's Jackie?

I told her she could go home.
It was just gonna be us tonight.


We did.
[Alex] Charlie cooked.

I helped.
[Alex] No, you didn't.

[Maya] Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.

Yes, I did!
Alex, we all cooked.

Why are you being weird, Mom?

I'm not. [chuckles]

We're making something special.
It's his mom's recipe.

Come.
Yummy!

Sit, relax.
Enjoy the "Mayor of Humdrum Falls."

Should we get your mom
to play Mop Hopsley?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Alexâ€¦

Maya, please come here.

Why?
'Cause I'm asking you to. Come here.

I don't want to.

Hey, go to your mom.

Get over here.

Get over here right now!

But why? I'm having fun.

Go to your room. Go.



[door opens]

[door closes]

So I'm guessing you heard.

Yeah.

She say why?

Mm-mm.

They fired me because I wrote the wrong
dates on my application form apparently.

Oh.

Yeah.
Yeah.



It's been a wacko couple of months.
Actually it'sâ€¦ Ugh.

You know, I wasn't even meant
to be working here.

I took this job
because I wanted to be close to my kids.

Then when I get here,
she won't even let me see them,

and then she starts making up this
insane stuff about poisoning the dog,

and then this, you knowâ€¦

I think the universe hates me, Amy.

Really.
Charlie...

At this point.
You know that's not true.

I'm really sorry this happened to you.

No, please. I'm sorry, 'cause I know
you've still got three more weeks,

and I'm not gonna be there to help.

But I canâ€¦ I can help here.

I can, like, look after them,
I can make sure you eat.

Anything you need.

Really. Anything.


Alex blew up the other day?

No.
Yeah.

She just lost it.

She was crying and screaming,
and, likeâ€¦ [exhales]

She's really struggling.

I'm working so much, soâ€¦

I'm so sorry.
I mean, you know, it's a lot, you know?

But what I think would be
really helpful to me is, umâ€¦

If I could spend some time alone
with them, you know?

Just me and the girls.

And I feel really bad saying this to you,

because I know that this has been
a day from hell for you.

I mean, Charlie, honestly,
you've had the year from hell. [chuckles]

No.

And, umâ€¦

God, I wish I could be there for you.

I just feel like shit. I'm so sorry.
No.

Amy, stop. I get it. Please.

It'sâ€¦ It's your kids. They need this.

Yeah.

And you're a good mom.

[chuckles weakly]
No, look at me.

You're a good mom.

Mm.

[chuckles, sniffs]

Okay.
I'm glad I can help.

[both chuckle]

Promise me you'll eat.

It smells good.
[chuckles]

It's my mom's recipe, you know.

Okay.
You know what?

Just, actually, just, like, sitting here,
talking to you,

being with youâ€¦

It made me realize
everything's gonna be okay.

I've got you.

I got Maya and Alex. I got my girls.

It's a job. I can get a job.

You can.


Yeah.


Night.

[tense music playing]

[sniffles, gasps]



[sniffs, cries muffled sobs]

[dial tone]

[keys beeping]

[line rings]

[tape recorder whirring]

[line ringing]

[distorted greeting]

Charlie? Hey.


I was, um...
<i>- You okay?</i>

Yes! Iâ€¦

for being so weird yesterday.

Like, last night, it was justâ€¦

<i>- No. Stop.</i>
Sorry.

<i>Did you and Alex
get some time after I left?</i>

We did. Yeah, thank you.

<i>Yeah? Oh, good.</i>

<i>I thinkâ€¦Â You know, I think that youâ€¦
Like, both of you needed that.</i>

Mm!

<i>I'm glad I could help.</i>


Youâ€¦ You know,
I'm about to go to work, andâ€¦

Charlie, it bothers me so much
that you're not gonna be there.

<i>I know. I know. I miss you too.</i>

<i>You wanna go to the park or something?
With the girls?</i>

Umâ€¦

<i>Amy?</i>

Uh, maybe lunch?

<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>
Okay.

<i>Lunch. Uhâ€¦ Lunch works. When's good?</i>

Uh, let me think

for a moment.

Umâ€¦

Saturday?

<i>Uhâ€¦ Yeah. Saturday works.</i>

But I have to go to work now,
so I'll find a place.

Great job.

So you remember
what we talked about?

The only way we can stop him
is if he admits to doing it,

so we gotta get him to confess.

[light music playing over loudspeakers]


[heartbeats pound over headphones]

Man, her pulse is racing.

[Amy breathes heavily]

I hope you guys can hear me.

["There Never Was A Time"

Right.

We'd sit in the backyard â™ª</i>

Oh fuck. [clears throat]

<i>â™ª From the summer sun
There was no way ofâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Fuck, fuck,Â fuck,Â fuck.

<i>â™ª And you'd play your old guitar â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'd fight mosquitos and enjoyâ€¦ â™ª</i>

He's walking in right now.

<i>â™ª For we had no television â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'd just begunâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Hey! [chuckles]

Hey.

Hello.

Hi. How's it going?

Well, you know.

You okay?
Yeah.

Yeah?
Yeah.

I like this place.

<i>â™ª We often dined upon a dimeâ€¦ â™ª</i>

What's going on?

Whew. [sighs]

So can I get you guys something to drink?

Uh, I'll get an iced tea, please.
[server] Iced tea.

I will just have water. Thanks.

<i>â™ª There'd be no gifts 'causeâ€¦ â™ª</i>

What do you think?

I'm starting a new job tonight.
Hoping these will make a good impression.

Where?
Elmsworth.

You're starting at Elmsworth tonight?
Yeah. Tonight, yeah.

Got all my stuff in the car,
ready for a new start.

That'sâ€¦ Wow, Charlie.

You ready to order?

Oh. Uhâ€¦ You know, I'll get aâ€¦
I'll get a cheeseburger.

Me too.
[server] All right.

Soâ€¦
[server] Two cheeseburgers, please!

How are the girls?

[server] Thank you.
They're really good.

How's the mayor?

Yeah, she's great.

Feeling better?

Yeah.

Work's been pretty awful
without you there.

We were like partners. [chuckles]

I know.

And, like, the worst part is

that everyone is just, you know,

talking shit about you all the time.

I guessed they would. Yeah.

It makes me mad 'cause you're not there
to defend yourself, and soâ€¦

You know, I'm going to town on everyone,
and Sandra, she...

Oh God!

Oh, she got an earful.
[chuckles]

Now they'll be talking shit about me.

I don't wanna talk about Park field. It'sâ€¦

Why not?

<i>â™ª Never was a time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There never was a time we didn't love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, there never was a timeâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Is it because

what they're saying's true?

'Cause, you know, umâ€¦

I wouldn't care if you did those things.

I didn't tell you.
I got permission to see my girls.

Two days every second week.

I was thinkingâ€¦
I don't know, I was thinking

that maybe you and Maya and Alex
and then me and my girls,

we could go on a day trip or something.

<i>â™ª Tell me why you've lost your splendor â™ª</i>

I wanna talk about Park field.

I wanna talk about what you did.

But I'll call soon.

He's leaving. You guys, he's leaving.
He's walking out right now.

Whatâ€¦ [panting]

Are you okay?

Where's Elmsworth?
Amy, where's Elmsworth Hospital?

Thirty miles away in Pennsylvania.

I'm gonna call Ellis.



We're good. They're gonna pick him up.

All right.
Bring him in.

We can only hold him for 48 hours.

[ominous music playing]

[mumbles indistinctly]

And talk to the people.

And I'm gonna make sure
there's something in my mind thatâ€¦

Open the door.

Slowly. Open the door.

[keys jangle]

Get out of the vehicle. Slowly.

Get down on the ground.

Put this hand behind your back.

Put this other hand behind your back.
Stay right there. Do not move.

My name is Detective Sergeant Tim Braun.
With me is Detective Dan Baldwin.

Today is Saturday, December 13, 2003.

The time is approximately 8:14 p.m.

We're in the Major Crimes interview room
with Mr. Charles Cullen.

Mr. Cullen, for the record,
could you please state your full name?

Uh, Charles Cullen.


Uh, C-H-A-R-L-E-S

C-U-L-L-E-N.

Is it okay if we call you Charlie, then?

Yeah.

Okay.


Okay, Charlie.

Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Charlie?

Umâ€¦

I mean, uhâ€¦ I don't think so, no.

How many IV bags have you polluted
at Park field Memorial Hospital?

We know you killed Kelly Anderson.

We know you killed Ana Martinez.
We know there's others.

We just wanna talk about it
with you, Charlie.

I can't. I'm not meant
to talk about patients

without the hospital lawyers.

You don't work there anymore.
You can say whatever you want.


I can't, soâ€¦

Why'd you kill 'em?

Was it just women, Charlie?

They remind you of your ex-wife maybe?

You know, that I could understand.

Or your mother?

I can't.

I can't.

You know, theâ€¦ the saline-bag stuff,

that wasâ€¦ was pretty smart.


You know, I never seen anything like that.

How'd you come up with that?

[Charlie sniffles]

Charlie?

Ten, 11?

Hey, Charlie, stick with me here, okay?

Come on back, Charlie.

Just gotta have this conversation, okay?
I know you can do it.

I can'tâ€¦

Charlie, can you look at me, please?

Mmâ€¦ I can't.

[Braun] Come on, Charlie.
I can't.

I know you can.

[Braun] Hey...
[handcuff bangs]


I can't. I can't.

I can't. I can't.

Charlie.
[handcuff bangs]

Charlie.
I can't.

I can't.
Charlie, you can.

I can't, I can't, I can't.

I can't, I can't.

[bangs table] Charlie!

[Charlie breathes deeply]

All right.

we've seen your PYXIS,

we've seen your orders,
we've seen the cancellations.

We know all about it.

We know how you poisoned the bags
in the storeroom,

had the other nurses hang 'em up.

You know what?
I don't think you picked Kelly, did you?

Did you?

what I've been wondering?

Now, I got no judgment. Charlie. Listen.

I can't.
Hey.

I can't.

[Braun] You can, Charlie. Yes, you can.
I can't.

I can't.

I can't.

[Braun] Hey.
I can't.

[Braun] Hey.
I can't.

Enough of this shit, Charlie!

I can't!Â I can't!Â I can't!

I can't!Â I can't!Â I can't!

I can't!Â I can't!Â I can't! I can't!

I can't!Â I can't!Â I can't!


I can't!

[doorbell rings]

[faint voices chatting on TV]

Hey.
Hi.

What happened?

We're not gonna get it.

He's not gonna break.
He's not gonna confess.


We have to release him tomorrow morning.

I'm sorry.

[pensive music playing]


Yeah.

Remember, you can't touch him.

You can't even get close to him.

He was my friend.

I just need to see him.

[ominous music playing]

[buzzer]
[door unlocks, opens]

[door slams]


Can you take his handcuffs off please?


[keys and chains jangling]

Are you okay?

[handcuffs clatter]

Umâ€¦

Go away, Amy.

You cold?

Look, you're freezing. Here.

I'm just gonna put this
over your shoulders.

There you go.

I really needed you
these few months, you know?

And then all this.


It made meâ€¦

Forget who you were to me.

Forget what you did for me, andâ€¦

I forgot about your goodness.

I'll never understand.

Not how you,

who is so kind and generousâ€¦

How you could hurt people.

And I'm so sorry

that I lied to you
and went behind your back.

That must make you feel even more alone.

Hey. Hey.

Allâ€¦ You know, I never hadâ€¦

You know,
I always just wanted to help you.

I know.

I know that.

And I still need you.

What do you need me to do?

Tell the truth.

[pensive music playing]

I just did it.

I just did it.

[sighs shakily]

I'm sorry. I'm gonna need more than that.

What do you want me to tell you?

Names.

I can't remember all the names.

Just tell me what you can remember.

Douglas Stevenson.

[ominous music playing]

Ana Martinez.

Kelly Anderson.

And thereâ€¦ there wasâ€¦

Uhâ€¦

I can't remember his name.
He was younger. Umâ€¦

Jack Ivins?
Yeah. Jack.

Jack. Yep.

And then thereâ€¦ there was aâ€¦

There was aâ€¦ a man at my last hospital,

uh, he had a German name. I can'tâ€¦

Why?

They didn't stop me.
