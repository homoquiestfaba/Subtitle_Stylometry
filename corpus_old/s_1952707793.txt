<i>117 AD The Roman Empire stretched.</i>

<i>from the African desert
to the Caspian Sea...</i>

<i>...but its farthest, most untamed
frontier was Northern Britain.</i>

<i>In this unforgiving land,
the Roman Army</i>

<i>encountered fierce resistance</i>

<i>from a people known as the Picts.</i>

<i>Using guerilla tactics</i>

<i>and the landscape
to their advantage,</i>

<i>they brought the invasion to a halt.</i>

<i>The stalemate
has lasted almost 20 years.</i>

<i>Rome has given orders to end
the deadlock</i>

<i>by any means necessary...</i>

<i>My name is Quintus Dias,
I am a soldier of Rome,</i>

<i>and this is neither the beginning
nor the end of my story.</i>

2 WEEKS EARLIER

INCH- TUTH- IL. MOST NORTHERLY GARRISON
ON THE FRONTIER.

<i>Two years on the frontier.</i>

<i>This place
is the arsehole of the world.</i>

<i>Even the land wants us dead.</i>

Centurion Dias, it's too darn cold
to be standing watch.

It's not my watch.
I was just wondering what's out there.

The patrol returns at dawn;
you should get some sleep.

<i>The longer we stay
the deeper the cold and damp</i>

<i>soaks into our bones;</i>

<i>and the rain makes way only for
the stinging bite of the North wind.</i>

<i>While we lose brave men
to foot rot and frost bite,</i>

<i>the Pict king, Gorlacon</i>

<i>sends his war parties to raid
along the frontier at will.</i>

Gentlemen.
Evening, sir.

Cold night on the front.

<i>My father believed that
to truly defeat an enemy</i>

<i>you must know him
better than yourself.</i>

<i>I know this enemy well.
They play only to their strengths</i>

<i>and will not be drawn
into open combat.</i>

<i>Instead they pick at the scab
until we bleed,</i>

<i>hiding in the shadows like animals,
striking hard and fast,</i>

<i>then falling back into the night.</i>

<i>Come the dawn we count our losses
and sow the earth with our dead.</i>

<i>This is a new kind of war.</i>

<i>A war without honour, without end.</i>

Come on!

Marcus, ride to Agricola.

Gate. Move!

Move, soldier!

Gratus.
Save yourself.

Go to hell.

We should kill them all.

This one could be useful!

He comes with us!

Virilus! Virilus!

YORK
GARRISON OF THE NINTH LEGION

The winner!

Yes!

Again.

Enough!

You put up a good fight,
now you drink with me.

Septus, more ale.

Again, Virilus.

You're a drunk.
An ugly drunk.

And not too bright.

Isn't ten times enough to know
when you're beaten?

Damn you. Again!

Once more.

Septus, your ruling....
and watch my flank.

Come on!

Sore loser.

Septus.

What are you waiting for, an order?

Get stuck in there!

Damn, that'll sober a man up quick.

When will people learn not to fuck
with the Ninth?

Some say it's irregular for you
to be seen drinking

with the men of the legion.

Septus, my old friend, they forget
I am a man of the Legion.

Soldier, have you been fighting?

Fighting is my job.

I have a message for your General

Now, point me in his direction
before I have you flogged.

Who are you?

I am the personal envoy
of Governor Agricola.

I suggest you get down off that horse
and give me your message

before I have you flogged!

General, sir. It would be my pleasure.

All leave is cancelled.

Agricola is mobilising the Ninth.
We're going to war, Septus.

Alert the senior legates to break camp
and prepare the men.

Sorry, General, sir...
Return to Agricola at once.

Tell him we rode out within the hour.
Yes, General.

Bastard!

Time to die, Roman.

<i>Gorlacon.</i>

<i>He was a farmer
until his wife was killed.</i>

<i>then he put down the plough
and took up the sword.</i>

<i>He changed the way the Picts fought.
It worked.</i>

<i>He turned the tide,
so they made him king.</i>

I will not yield.

What does Agricola intend
for my people?

Damn you, Pict.
When will he send his armies North?

I am a soldier of Rome.
I will not yield!

Know your enemy my son.

Rome will make you bleed for this.

You first Centurion.

CARLISLE.
HEADQUARTERS OF JULIUS AGRICOLA

I don't care how you do it
but wipe them out...

...and bring Gorlacon
before me in chains.

Governor, you're the politician,
I'm just a simple soldier...

But I'm not so simple that I can't see
you're looking for a way back to Rome.

My bones ache for Rome.

This place is the graveyard
of ambition.

And men.

And I won't sacrifice mine
to be pawns in your game.

I see.

Let us be frank, General.

The conquest of Britain
is a lost cause.

With one bold stroke
we could change all that.

With the Ninth Legion at your command
we can crush this enemy.

You and your men
could retire with wealth and honour.

My men have honour enough.

Enough to disobey a direct order?

Well...

...to kill the snake
you have to cut off its head.

I need to find Gorlacon.

For that I have someone special
in mind.

General Virilus, meet Etain.

My Brigantes tracker.
Can't speak a word...

but she can hunt anything
over any terrain.

I swear she's part wolf.

I apologise for the theatrics,
but I wanted to prove a point.

Slaves cost nothing.
Trust is priceless!

I don't know whether to fight her or...
She's mute, not deaf.

I have my own scouts.
Not like her. She knows the Picts...

...knows their ways,
knows their hideaways.

She will guide you
into the mountains.

What's she sitting over there for?

She's been looking at you all night.
I know she has. I've spotted it.

Can't take her eyes off you.

Come on, come on you.

She's speechless you daft bastard.

She's got no tongue in her head,
you fool. I wouldn't get too close.

No tongue, that's perfect...

she'll have more room for this...

I think that's Pict for 'fuck off'.

She must be a good scout
if she can find your cock.

I think it's love.

I'll have a go
with the mutt this time.

Report?

Three Pict riders, and another;
a prisoner on foot.

I think he might be Roman.

Centurion Remus, take the column.

Stay down... stay down... stay down.

We'll get nothing out of him.

We can't take prisoners on the march,
you know what to do.

Head or ship?
Head.

I win.

Sorry, mate. Orders are orders.

Thank the Gods you found me.

Not the Gods you should thank,
it's her.

Etain, our Pict scout.
She found you.

What's your name, soldier?

My name's Quintus Dias.
Second in Command.

Inch- tuth- il frontier garrison.

Well,
sorry we couldn't get here sooner.

Are you the relief column?
Not quite.

I'm Titus Flavius Virilus,
Commander of the Ninth Legion.

We've come here looking for a fight.

Then you'll get one.

General.
Centurion Dias.

Now you look like a Roman.
How do you feel?

Cuts and bruises, sir.
Nothing that won't heal in time.

Well, sometimes there are scars
that cannot be seen.

You escaped the clutches
of Gorlacon

but I must ask you to return with us
into the lion's den.

Best to get back into the fight,
General.

Spoken like a soldier.
Gladiator.

My father was Scipio Dias.

I saw him win the fight
that earned him his freedom.

He was magnificent.
He taught me how to fight.

When to choose my battles.

Come meet the men.

Septus.
Sir?

Get this man a drink.
I think he deserves it.

Come and join us. Be warm.
Have a well earned drink.

Thank you.

Tomorrow you ride by my side.

Perhaps you can teach me
something about Pict hospitality.

Thax. Bothos.

Septus, I'll be doing my rounds.

Evening, General.

I can't understand
a word of these Picts.

If they ever catch me, I'm fucked!

I've never seen a General
so beloved of his men.

Well, in training he is our scholar,
at the feast he is our father,

in the ranks he is our brother.

And in battle he is the God we pray
to save our souls.

Where did you read that.
It's written on the shithouse wall.

Probably wrote it himself.
He's a ruthless, reckless bastard....

...and I'd die for him
without hesitation.

It's a trap!
Column!

Form up. Form up.

Quickly. Come on!

Dismount!

Get the horses to the rear.

Tight. Quickly.

Steady, boys. Shields!

Watching!

Whatever comes out of that mist, lads,
you will hold the line.

Quintus, ride to the rear.

Find Centurion Remus,
tell him to pull the column back.

Make a hole.
Keep watching.

Get ready.

Watching.

Hold the line!

Stand tall.

Quintus.
Bothos.

You made it.
This man saved my life.

Brick, here.

The General?
No.

We've got to move.
Can you make it?

Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

Let's get moving.

<i>In the chaos of battle,
when the ground beneath your feet</i>

<i>is a slurry of blood, puke, piss</i>

<i>and the entrails
of friends and enemies alike,</i>

<i>it's easy to turn to the gods
for salvation</i>

<i>But it's soldiers who do the fighting
and soldiers who do the dying.</i>

<i>And the Gods
never get their feet wet.</i>

Thax.
Thank the Gods some of us made it.

Only you?

Macros, second cohort.

Leonidas,

junior scout and peltast.

Are we all that's left?

We were out smarted.
That's all, time to go home.

We need to find the General's body.
He deserves a nobler tomb than this.

The General is still alive.

Are you sure.
I saw them take him away in chains.

Which way?
North.

Then we follow north.
You would go after the Picts?

They'll have patrols sweeping
these forests for survivors.

We might as well slit our own throats.

If the General's alive, it's our duty.

Where did you come from?
From the kitchens.

Good work, soldier.

My name is Tarak.
I'm not a soldier, I'm a cook.

Not any more. Scavenge what you can.
Food supplies, weapons.

Ditch your armour, we travel light.

Shit! That Macros can move.

He used to be a marathon runner
before he joined up.

How do you know that?
We make the food, we know everything.

Take cover.

I knew we should never have trusted
that bitch.

I know where they've taken
the General.

Move out.

This way. The cave.

Get up those mountains. Get up!

Here, some food.

No.

Death Caps.
They can kill you in minutes.

To the untrained eye they look similar
to these, which are delicious.

Thanks.

Tarak. It's Assyrian, right?

Yes. But it's not my real name,
it was given to me.

What's your real name?
I doubt you could pronounce it.

It's from the mountains
of the Hindu Kush where I was born.

Leonidas, right?

Greek father, sir.
Move closer to the fire.

Where are you from, Bothos?

I'm from the army.
It's all I've ever known.

They picked me up from the street,

trained me,
told me I could better myself.

So, tell me, Bothos.
Do you feel better or worse?

Macros?

I escaped with my life
by running from Numidia.

Didn't stop until I reached Greece.

Then I ran for sport.

Now I'm running for my life again.

We're all a long way from home.

This was supposed to be my last tour.

Still could be.

Had my eye on a farm in Tuscany

where the sun warms the skin.

Brick, what kind of name is that,
anyway?

Short, sir, for Ubrickulius.

Your mother must have been... wise.

She was a fucking comedian.

Brick, it is then.

Get some sleep.
I'll stand first watch.

General.
Where are my men?

With your Gods.

Traitor.

She would answer your charge
but she cannot speak. Do you know why?

She was a child when she came to us
seeking sanctuary.

Her own village had been slaughtered
as punishment for resisting Roman rule.

To set an example they burnt out
her fathers eyes.

They raped her mother until
she was begging to die.

Etain was forced to watch
before she too was raped.

And finally they cut out her tongue
that she may not speak ill

of the bloody Roman empire.

She fled north
and came to us for shelter.

We raised her
and made her one of our own.

And when she came of age
we sent her back to you...

...to feign allegiance
and deliver you into our hands.

The army is still dispersed.
When it's dark we go in!

Let's go.

Go.

Go.

Go.

Pict dog!

Come on.
Come on.

Brick, Bothos with me;
the rest of you watch the perimeter.

General.
The Legion?

Only myself
and a small cohort remain.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, shit.

Come on.

Leave me.

Come here.... come here.

Shut up...

Shut up.

Shit.
Leave!

We will not abandon you, sir.

What's left of the Legion
is yours to command, now go.

We have to leave.

Go now.

Get them home.

That's for the Ninth!

Where's Thax?

Had to take care of a small problem.

I've got the General's helmet,
where is he?

We couldn't free him.... Come on.

We came all this way for nothing.

Fuck.

See what you have done?

Before you die,

know that the men who did this
will not live to tell your tale.

Well, let's get on with it, then.

Your Roman friends should have known,

cold iron does not bend.
It breaks.

Well, what are you waiting for?
Do you fear me?

No man brave enough?

Let's see
what you're made of she- wolf.

Go.

We need to keep moving
while we have the lead.

On foot, over this?

Wherever they may hesitate,
we must go.

We keep moving, North.

But our lines are to the South.

And that's where they'll be
looking for us.

Look, we can't out run them.

So we have to outsmart them.

We head North. Throw them off our trail
then double back;

West, then South.

It may take days, even weeks

but we're so far behind enemy lines

it's our only chance of getting home.

Come on.

You'll be needing this then,
Centurion.

Etain, you are my wrath.

Send their bodies to hell
and bring me their heads.

<i>When the Picts come after you
they never stop.</i>

<i>They can run for hours,
ride for days.</i>

<i>They barely eat and rarely sleep.</i>

<i>Etain, like the wolf,
has learned to hunt from birth.</i>

<i>It is part sense, part instinct.</i>

<i>She can read the terrain,
search for signs of passing.</i>

<i>Run her quarry to ground
and close in for the kill.</i>

<i>Now she hunts Romans.</i>

<i>Now we are the prey.</i>

Move! Keep moving!

Leo, we've got to keep moving.

No. We need to rest.
I can't go on, I'm too cold.

Come, take him.

Brick, find shelter,
anywhere out of this wind.

Enough. Help me.

He's slowing us down. Just say
the word and I'll take care of it.

We live united or die divided...

...starting with you.

You can stick this out if you want
but first chance I get

and I'm taking care of myself.

It's your funeral.

<i>When they paint their faces
in the blue woad</i>

<i>it is more than just a decoration
it is a sacred right.</i>

<i>To the Picts it means
they'd sooner die than fail.</i>

<i>It means for them
there is no turning back.</i>

<i>These men are the best
I've ever seen.</i>

<i>Am I worthy enough to lead them?</i>

<i>My father taught me that in life</i>

<i>duty and honour
matter above all things.</i>

<i>A man without his word
is no better than a beast.</i>

<i>I made a promise to a General
to get his soldiers home.</i>

<i>That is my task, that is my duty.</i>

Not bad for a Greek. Come on.

Drink while it's hot.

What is that?
The stomach.

The moss inside is half digested.

Try it, it's good.
