Jo-sho.

-He come this way?
-No, man.

Y'all seen Melvin?

That crazy white dude?

Yeah, white chocolate.

Man, I ain't seen
Melvin in a while.

Melvin's somewhere though.

He's somewhere
to be found.

But what you looking
for Melvin for?

Boy gotta go to court.

He goin' be late.

Trouble again, huh?

He ain't never gonna get his son
back acting like this, man.

He looks like he should stop
doing everything he been doing.

They ain't stoppin' shit.

-Let me go find his ass.
-Somebody gon' find him.

-A repeat. A repeat.
-Somebody gon' find him.

I'll catch y'all
on another side.

You take care of yourself.

-Alright.
-Alright.

Melvin!

Where you at, you
mother fucker?

I told y'all.

You wanna make a
movie about Melvin?

You gon' to spend half of
your time trying to find

this mother fucker.

You seen Melvin?

No, I ain't seen
that mother fucker.

Damn!

Hey, if you see him tell
him to head on home!

Alright, I got that.

Alright.

Y'all seen Melvin?

I ain't seen that
mother fucker.

You ain't seen
that mother fucker?

-Who's that?
-Melvin.

-No.
-Ah, shit.

Every mother fucking
time something going on,

this mother fucker
gotta disappear.

Melvin!

There's the mother
fucker's bike.

And there's the
mother fucker's shoe.

There's the other shoe.

Attached to this
ig'nant mother fucker.

Melvin!

Get your ass up, man!

What the fuck is
wrong with you?

Acting like your ass
is homeless and shit.

-Stole my shoe?
-I found your damn shoe.

Oh, yeah? What's it doing
in your hand then?

What the fuck is it
doing off your foot?

It's sitting
right over there.

You look like shit.

Fuck.

I remember the
party and then...

Man, you left about 4 A.M.

Just slipped off
into the darkness.

Did I dream it or
did I get with Caroline?

You better hope you didn't
get with that fat bitch.

She two hundred and
fifty pounds, man.

She's kinda foxy though.

That fox don't need to eat
for another three years.

Now, come on, man.

That's better.

You know you gotta be
in court this morning.

What?

You gotta be in
court this morning.

Why didn't you
say that earlier?

What the fuck you think I've
been trying to say to you, man?

-Come on, man.
-Fuck.

-Shit.
-Damn it, Melvin.

Riding around town all god damn
morning looking for your ass.

We gotta go man.
I gotta change.

Yeah, no shit?

Fuck.

Shit, shower, and shave.

Shit, it smell like a pack
of horses coming at a

mother fucker ass first.

How the fuck you
end up over here?

I mean, you my brother
and I love you,

but sometimes you do
some silly ass shit.

Fucking thing! Come on!

Man, ride.

Complaining about
you fuckin' up.

The fuck.

Stupid, Melvin.

Fucking stupid.

Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about. Shit.

So you had to stay
out all night, huh?

One of these days.

One of these days.

Ha! One, two, three!

Come on!

Shit.

Man, I can do this
my god damn self.

I'm trying to
help you, man.

Do it look like I need
your help, mother fucker?

Well, you are in a
wheelchair, you know?

I ain't no spastic.

I never said you were.

You want my help or not?

One of these days I'm
going to get my a new

chair that don't need no skinny
ass to push it up ramps.

Will you stop
your moaning?

One of those carbon fiber mother
fuckers that do tricks and shit.

Come on, buddy.

You know, you look so handsome
when you make the effort.

I don't understand why you
have to dress like a hobo.

Oh, come on, mom.

How do I look, Luc?

Judge will give you five years
for wearing that cheap suit.

-Jesus.
-Lucille, leave him alone.

He looks just like he did
on his first day of school.

I was just joking, miss h.

The judge is going
to dig you, bro.

Alright, you wanna
hear my letter?

Sure.

Why not? Lay it on me.

Okay.

Dear sir, I know I haven't
exactly been the best

father to date, but I'm
here today to tell you

that I can't be a better
father if I'm in prison.

All I want to do is see
my boy again and I'll do

whatever you ask me just to
spend some time with time.

He loves his father
and he needs me.

And if you give me the
chance, I am capable of

being a stable and solid
influence in his life.

Now the charge of
kidnapping sounds very

extreme to me because it's
not in fact what happened.

We just wanted to go
on a holiday together,

me and Rex, is all.

Maybe I didn't
handle it right, sir.

I understand, but my ex is
a real pain in the ass--

man, you cannot say that
stuff to the judge, man.

Yeah, you gotta let the
judge decide the rest.

Come on, man.

Okay, here are your sandwiches
in case it goes on a while.

Crust off for Lucille,
crust on for you.

Okay, great.

Hey, good luck, bro.

You look like a fucking
hobo in that suit.

Hey, thanks, sis.

Love you.

Love you, more.

I can do it myself.

No, you can't.

Boy, what you think
about the ride?

Oh, it's dope, man.

Where'd you get it?

Oh, man, borrowed
it from my uncle.

Know you gotta make a good
impression on that judge, right?

A good impression?

What kind of
narcotic you on, son?

-Thanks for doing this, man.
-Anytime!

Hey, miss h,
how we looking?

Like the village people.

Love you, ma.

Get out of here
before you're late.

Thank you, miss h!

Courthouse.

Be careful.

I'm running late.
Come on, let's move.

You got this, Melvin.

You got this.

Alright.

Hey, kick some ass, bro.

Good luck, man.

Hey, man. What happened?

Fucking prick gave me a
community service order.

He banned all contact with
Rex, pending assessment.

Well, atleast you didn't
go to jail, right?

Yeah, I wanna
see my kid, man.

Get it?

Fuck!

Aw, what other way
could it have gone?

This stupid bitch.

Don't do it, brother.

Thank you.

-No, no, no!
-Mel, Mel!

Feeling good about
yourself, Doreen?

So are you gonna tell Rex that
you banned me from seeing him?

Or are you gonna lie like you
normally do and blame it on me?

The judge banned
you, not me.

Yeah, cause you fucking
instructed him.

Melvin, do not
swear at me, okay?

I'm not
intimidated by you.

Those days are past us.

Doreen, please.

Don't do this to me.

You're hurting Rex just as
much as you're hurting me.

I mean, why do you
have to be so cruel?

What did I ever do
to hurt you so bad?

You need reminding.

Please don't do this.

It's done, okay?

The judge has
passed it down.

Yeah, well, when Rex is
older, he's gonna hate you

for using him
to get at me.

I am not using him.

I just don't want him to
live amongst the wreckage

that is your life.

Look at you!

You have no manners
and no grace.

And I abhor what
you've become.

Hey.

Yeah!

Woo!

That mother fucker George Bush,
sent us over to Iraq in '91.

82nd airborne division.

Man, I remember that first push.
We're going through boswa.

We was tripping.

I get hit by this sniper.

Mother fucker tagged
me from behind.

Took out my lower spine.

Love you guys.

My wife, she was so
ashamed of having a

husband that the stank
bitch didn't even show up

to fort brag when they
sent my ass home.

But Melvin did.

Him and his momma.

Told me I could stay with them
til I got my shit together.

One of these days he's gonna
get his shit together.

You know what he said?

He said I could stay with him
til I get back on my feet.

What kinda shit is that?

Back on my feet.

Right.

Jump!

Shit!

You alright, man?

I'm good, I'm
good, I'm good!

I'm good.
Baby, I'm good.

Lucas is here.

What?

Lukey!

With his
spectacles and all.

Yeah, lukey!

The mother fucking
science teacher.

What's up, bro?
How you doing, man?

Melvin is not like
other people.

Ever since we were kids,
we came to discover he had

um, abilities to move
objects using only the

power of his mind.

Okay, so um...

On first glance, if
you look at both heads,

you don't see
anything different.

Now, let's look at
Melvin's again.

Here, we start to notice
very small anomalies on

the outer sleeve
of the brain.

That's about the only thing
that I see that's different.

And I've been...

I've studied this guy
for over a decade.

Everything else about
him reads normal.

I run tests on every other part
of his body and found nothing.

Now, Mel he comes in from time
to time and we check to,

you know, to see if his
blood clean, his brain is

flowing, simple stuff.

We don't publicize.

We don't talk about anything
outside of my laboratory.

Truth is, and he don't
mind me saying this,

and speaking as
a professional,

he has so much to offer
the world of science

and there's so much
potential for him.

This little light,
this little light

wee-ha!

Yes, sir!

-Yes, sir!
-Hallelujah!

Nice, reverend!

Here on this beautiful
afternoon,

you're about to
experience magic.

Yes, I tell you,
beautiful, magic.

You are gonna watch this
wheelchair levitate in the air.

Oh, yeah!

Levitate!

But to make this trick
successful, I need a dollar.

Yes, I ain't say
thirty-five cents and no,

I didn't say no
fifty-five cents.

I need a dollar.

Going once.

And you, the
beautiful in the pink.

Thank you so very much.

Anyone else?

You got one more
dollar, brother.

Give me that last one.
This is the one.

Let's go, let's
go, let's go!

Anybody else?

You're gonna
watch some magic.

I promise you that.

Criss angel ain't got
nothing on this trick.

Now, here we go!

Everyone, are you ready?

The best act out
of the west bank.

My main man, a
hundred grand.

Here he is y'all!

That's my boy!

That's my boy!

He's settling in.

It's a part of
the meditation.

Let the magic man do
what the magic man do.

Pictures ain't free.

Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it is about to go down.

Oh, yes!

What'd I tell you!

Do not try this at home.

I need a dollar.
I need a dollar.

Anybody else?
Come on, come on.

That's what I'm
talking about.

Come on! You see,
that's magic.

Give it up for him y'all!

Melvin!

The kitchen furniture
moves you're doing,

please can you put it back?

Yeah, mom, I'm playing
the piano here.

Please put the table and
chairs back where they belong.

You know I don't love
you touching my stuff.

Coming.

-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

And the lamp.

What is up with you, love?

Hey, Melvin?

My curling iron,
it's shorted.

So? Is that my problem?

Um, yeah, actually
it is your problem.

It's you're fucking fault.

-You, language.
-What are you talking about?

Okay, do you see my hair?

Do you want me to go see
Ryan like this? Really?

No, Ryan or not, you do
not curse in this house.

Okay. Well, you know what?

Thanks a lot, Melvin.

You're a dick.

Can't wait to meet, Ryan.

-Fuck off.
-He sounds lovely.

Are you feeling okay?

Sure, mom.

Never better.

I've been living here
about thirty-five years.

I seen all kinda changes, but
nothing to compare to Katrina.

Mm-mmm.

She just came along and
blew everything away.

We gets all kinda hurricanes
around these parts.

But we ain't never seen
nothing like her before.

Mm-mmm.

Man, the lord was angry.

People was floating
along the streets.

Dogs!

Families standing
on rooftops

crying cause they ain't
gots no home no more.

My old man, he a booze hound,
he been on the ward for years.

And my boy, Deon,
he in the pen.

So me?

I gots no one to help me.

So I sank to my knees and
i asked the lord to help me.

The lord come.

Melvin.

Melvin, that's what!

He showed up when the
storm was raging and I was

cowering in my kitchen like a
kicked dog, roof clean gone.

And he led me
out to safety.

Storm passed, sun came
out, wind died down.

I come home,
my roof is on.

How...

How you gonna explain
shit like that?

The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness.

And kurtz's life was
running swiftly, too.

And kurtz's life was
running swiftly, too.

Genius.

As Conrad got older,
he wrote less.

He eventually
settled in england.

Didn't care much for public
scrutiny or adoration.

Guess he just wanted to be out
in the country by himself.

Like Conrad, mom was a
reclusive writer as well.

Listen to this.

The day broke
gray and dull.

God!

I mean, I wish I could come
up with shit like that.

Instead, I look out the
window and I think, oh, fuck!

It's raining.

Here, there's something
else I wanna read you.

Fuck off.

One day, I was like
i guess maybe uh,

it was right
before Katrina.

Actually, it was a little
ways before Katrina.

This fucking family shows up
in the neighborhood, right?

And it's fucking Mel and
his mom and his fucking

smoking hot sister.

And this black guy
in a wheelchair,

named fucking Lucille.

And fucking Mel, he does
this weird ass trick,

right, where he likes stacks
up these quarters, okay?

And it's like just sitting
there still and all of a

sudden he starts doing
this shit and the quarters

start lifting up, right?

And they start separating.

And I was like, looking
at Lyle, we're both like,

what the fuck, man?

Now, we're just like
fucking boys, I mean.

Lucille, Mel, Lucas, Lyle,
me, we're like family.

You know what I mean?

How much you got, Lyle?

Eighty dollars.

Shit, get as much
as you can get.

Think I got
enough for that--

-quarter.
-Quarter?

Alright, man.

See if they'll
roll one up for me.

I don't like rolling
mother fucker.

These niggas ain't got
nothing better to do.

You don't know
how to roll.

Yo, what's up, Nate?

You got some
weed for me, bro?

You know it.

Hey, holla at my man,
ramone, right there.

What's going on, bro?

If it ain't
black-man and Robin.

What's happening?

Sup, cuz?
Cat got your tongue?

We ain't related, nigga.

And don't be
calling your cuz.

We might be related considering
i banged your momma.

Big baller,
shot caller, huh?

Hey, man, come on. Get
that little crippled

mother fucker up out of
here talking that shit.

You got it, dude.

Well, get it the fuck up
out of here then, dude.

Okay, man.

This c-block, cuz.

Nate, man, i
appreciate it brother.

No doubt.

I hate having to kiss that
mother fucker, Nathan's,

ass just for a
couple joints.

Ah, damn, man.

Hey, who got shot?

Remember that kid who used
to be dribbling around
with that basketball.

Yeah.

Got wasted off a
crack rock, Luc.

Dealed from that
mother fucker, Nathan.

Shit, if I wasn't in this
mother fucking chair,

I'd beat all the black
off that mother fucker.

He'd be a Caucasian in
about five minutes.

I'll tell you that
right now, shit.

Feel that?

Yeah.

I can make you come
with my finger.

Imagine what I could
do with my tongue.

Hunny?

Fuck off.

What?

Jesus, you're
a train wreck.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

You mind giving the man
in the chair a shot?

I am so sorry, honey,
but I have a man.

What rap they get
you on, kid?

I'm talking to you.

What'd you do?

Why'd you get
community service?

I set my school on fire.

Smoke weed?

If life gets you down,

it's not a bad
thing to try.

Always helped me.

Here.

Sunny, Florida.

Rex is still a baby there.

He won't even
remember that one.

First day at school.

Notice, how the mother
isn't featured.

My old man he split when
uh, when I was just a kid.

I'm not about to let
that happen to Rex.

Fuck you.

Care for a mint?

Give me that
mother fucker.

You look a little
peaky, Mel.

No, I'm just tired, dude.

Really?

Oh, here we go.

You're trying to
scare me now, huh?

I'm just saying is all.

You look like you
could use rest.

Right, but I'm charting
okay though, right?

It's not what they're saying,
it's what I'm saying.

You know, one day, it
won't hurt if you saw

professional help cause i
really don't have a clue

what I'm looking for.

No doctors, buddy.

You know that.

Yeah, they're people out there
that know a lot more than me.

I'm a science teacher
in a local college.

Doesn't make me any
great authority.

God handing out
all the gifts.

I'm stuck in
this damn chair.

Yeah, but you got me.

That ain't no damn
consolation prize.

So, we done here or what?

Yeah.

-Sweet.
-Lucas.

Let me get a couple of
those pills you gave me

last time for the pain.

No, lu.

-Mel.
-Hey, hey.

Hey, you.

Lucas, you got two of
these. Can I have one?

Give a nigga a lab coat
and he think he a doctor.

He's getting pissed.

-Alright.
-You ain't gonna get your--

thank you, doc.

Take care of
yourself, okay?

Yeah, I'm good, man.

Chill.

Ten across with the
a in the middle.

Annihilation.

Mother fucker.

How you know that shit?

Oh, just a guess.

What's next?

Alright, seven down when
the same a in the middle.

Anomaly.

-Anoma, what?
-Anomaly!

It's like a
one-off, like me.

Man, you ain't no one-off.

You a circus freak.

That's funny
coming from you.

Yeah, I got put here.

Yeah, you think I chose?

Man, you ain't got
nothing but choices.

All you choose to do is
smoke weed and chase cat.

Whoa!

Jimmy!

What up, Jimmy?

Hey, what it look like?

You get a haircut?

Look at him. Cleaner than
the board of health.

Butch. Sundance.

We ain't doing
that, Jimmy.

We just chilling.

Mm-hmm.

Come on, Melvin.
Put it out.

Show a little respect
for Christ's sakes.

It's a joint, man.

-I mean--
-i see that.

Here, man.

Thank you, Lucille.

Not a problem.

You know what kills me?

Smoking?

No.

What kills me is that
you're out here every day

doing the same thing.

Getting high, drinking
beers like there's no

tomorrow with cool
runnings over here.

That shit ain't funny.

That was funny.

That shit ain't funny.

When what you could
be doing is taking

responsibility amongst
your community.

I've seen the things
you can do, Melvin.

It's no secret
around here.

You got a gift.

But you're wasting it.

You ever thought
about helping out?

You know?

Hell, maybe create a nicer
environment for your son

to grow up in.

There's something
to think about.

What is this?

Huh?

National pick on
Melvin day, Jimmy?

No, it's national get your
shit together day and I

say that because I care.

Tell that mother fucker
again cause son of a bitch

don't listen to me.

And don't be calling
me cool runnings.

I'm on it, Jimmy,
alright? I'm on it.

Yeah, on what?

Since Amelia?

I'm gonna work
on it, okay?

You got my word. I...

Give me some time, alright?

I'll get my
shit together.

Oxycodone.

Semi-synthetic, slow
release painkiller first

synthesized by eminent
pharmacologists,

freund and speyer,
in Germany in 1916.

I'm a fan.

Now, I'm gonna show you
some crimes scenes.

Third story up, I knew these
guys were robbing the place.

Their car was sitting
here, engine running.

These two knuckleheads jump
down, they jam into their car.

They spot me.

One guy comes
at me, crack!

I put him over the head.

Next guy, starts waving
some screwdriver at me.

Relieved him of that.

Put him down.
Done.

All units, we got a 211 in
progress on Atlantic boulevard.

Get them, Lyle.

Come on, man.
Let's move!

The old Vicodin.

Heavy, opiate narcotic
to treat severe pain.

It's the most widely
prescribed prescription

medication in
this country.

Over 140 million prescriptions
of this drug alone.

And I'm proud to say that
I'm not one of those people.

Why?

Because I steal mine.

Woo!

Come on, Lyle!

I chase down the guys the cops
don't have time to deal with.

Junkies, small
time criminals.

You gotta be careful.

A desperate man can
be a dangerous man.

These guys?

Fucking amateurs.

Fucking robbed the store for
sixty some odd dollars.

What is wrong
with these people?

Yeah, they're crooks,
but they have a bit of

initiative
they're showing.

And I like that, because
they're not just sitting

around waiting for a
fucking handout, you know?

That's the problem
with the country.

You gotta bunch of lazy
mother fuckers sitting on

their fat asses with a
begging bowl in one hand

and McDonald's
in the other.

Yeah, they're criminals,
but atleast they're trying.

Woo-hoo!

Yee-ha!

What?

I was ready to love the
whole fucking world.

Rawr!

But no one understood me!

Nobody!

So I learned to hate.

You think I'm the one
to set things straight?

Look at me, man.

Wrong.

Ah, fuck.

No, no, no.

Talented and
astute, but lazy.

Likely to understand everything
and even accomplish something.

He had nonetheless been content
to enjoy life as a spectator.

Maupassant, i
dig you, man.

I dig you!

Get off!

Oh my god!

Mom, look.

Oh my god!

Oh my god!

What happened?

You okay?

I was out, or what?

Yeah, you were out.

Let me go get somebody.

Hey, man.

Hey, mom.

How you doing?

You're gonna be okay.

What happened?

Ah, let me see.

Melvin was being Melvin.

Melvin can do anything.

Melvin think he can fly.

Melvin think he can drink
a whole liquor store.

Melvin jump off cliff.

Hurt when hit ground.

That's pretty much
what happened, man.

-Hi.
-How you doing?

Hi, how are you feeling?

You just woke up?

Yeah, what is this thing?

This just checks
your heart rate.

You went into cardiac
arrest so we're just

monitoring you right now.

You gonna be
his nurse today?

Yes, sir.

Can you by my
nurse tomorrow?

Sure.

Alright.

That's what I'm
talking about.

I got a little pain down
below and you know,

he's been dead for a while.

I was wondering if you could
bring him back to life,

you know, a little
mouth to mouth

resuscitation would
help me right now.

Stop, don't
listen to that.

We apologize for him.

That's okay.

We get that all the time.

I was just having
fun with you, girl.

Just being serious.

Sir, is your full
name Melvin hesper?

That's me doc,
but call me Mel.

We cannot seem to find any
medical records on you.

Any type of history?

I never go to
the hospitals.

Never?

Never broke a bone,
a bad flu, anything?

What about medical
insurance?

Are you covered?

Why would I be covered if
i don't go to a hospital?

These scars, they look
like gunshot wounds.

What can you tell
me about them?

They're gunshot wounds.

That's very funny.

How did you get them?

A gun.

Tell me about this one.

Oh, this?
It's nothing.

Just some cap stuck
me a few years back.

You didn't get
medical help?

I don't have
insurance, doc.

Sir, you just suffered a
serious cardiac arrest.

Your heart stopped beating
for several minutes.

You were certified dead.

Look, we're gonna need to
keep you under observation

for atleast
forty-eight hours.

Our preliminary tests
produced some particularly

interesting results that
may be personal to you.

Lying there in the hospital,
i realized something.

I got it all wrong.

I've been a total asshole.

You on some kind of
narcotic, nigger?

No, I'm being serious.

I got a gift here, man.

I gotta start using it.

Use it for the good.

I'm gonna change.

I'm gonna start fighting
crime, not committing it.

I've been saying
that shit for years.

Yeah, I know. Well, I wasn't
ready to listen, okay?

But lying there with my
whole life flashing in

front of me,
it came to me.

I'm gonna do whatever
it takes for Rex.

No more drinking.

No more weed, pills.

I'm even gonna
stop cigarettes.

Pussy, cheating,
hustling, stealing.

I'm even thinking about
stopping jerking off.

Yeah, I wouldn't
go that far.

No--

maybe that's a
bit too much.

Yeah, that's too much. Shit.

From this day forward, I'm
going straight, brother.

I am.

Well, alright.

I'll tell you what,
I'm with you, Melvin.

Melvin, this is
your calling.

What you got is a gift.

It's from the heavens.

So is Rex, brother.

So is Rex.

Fuck.

It's okay.

He got the plan
inside his hand.

Understand that
he's the man.

Each and every time
abide the sign.

Press the rewind
in your own mind.

Kick it one more time.

Hey, Mel. Can you bend
his mouth to shut up?

Uh!

See he got the master
plan inside his hand.

Understand that he's
the man, got the plan.

Surprise.

You gotta be kidding me.

Drink it.

It's robiatic.

It's what?

Healthy.

You mean macrobiotic.

Whatever, man.

Just drink the shit.

It's good for you.

I can't drink
this shit man.

I'll start voting green
peace and dating guys.

Alright.

It's good.

You know, I read this
book about health.

I put some
celery in there.

They said to clean out the
lungs, you know, reduces mucus.

And you'll spit all that
tarred-nicotine from them

cigarettes out.

And then I put some ginger
in there that'll clean out

the blood stream.

Help get all that alcohol
and whatever else you been

putting up your damn nose.

And uh, you
gonna piss a lot.

-Just understand that.
-Mm-hmm.

But that's a good thing.

I taste the ginger.

Yeah, it got a
little heat on it.

I put some rhubarb
in there, too.

Rhubarb?

Rhubarb.

-Yeah.
-What the hell is rhubarb?

It clears the mind.

It's a root.

Oh, I know.
Yeah, yeah.

I ain't put no voodoo
or nothing on this.

It's just to
clean you out.

Yeah!

One more, one more.

Come on, champ.

I care about you, brother.

I wanna see
you get better.

I wanna see you do better.

Thanks, buddy.

We was fourteen?

We was twelve actually.

Yeah, just about
to turn thirteen.

We met in uh, California.

I hadn't seen my boy
for some years and

then I come back, and he's
able to do all this stuff

like, you know, make
spoons move across the

table and shit like that.

You know.

Black people don't
usually, you know, get

along with that kinda
stuff, you know.

That's why you don't see
a lot of black people at

magician shows, you know.

Cause they think it's like
voodoo and the devil.

Yeah, I remember I called you
and I was like, where's Lucille?

And I asked your mom, and
she said, Melvin, he's gone.

He's in the military.

I said, what?
What the fuck?

Slap him.
Slap him.

Two peas and a biscuit.

Two peas and a biscuit.

Hit that mother fucker.

Drop the bitch.

I left dodging bullets and
ending up dodging more bullets.

And one of them got me.

You have no idea what's
in that box of yours

do you, mother fucker?

That's what I'm
talking about.

Muscle memory.

Like riding a bike.

You don't know what your made
of til you test that heart.

Go on, put it to the test.

What he can do around
these neighborhoods,

around the world, around the
country with that gift,

could fix a whole
lot of shit.

What the fuck!

Sorry!

What the hell
just happened?

Hey, pipe down.

We're training over
here, mother fucker.

Fuck.

I knew he was
paralyzed, you know.

I mean, he told me that.

And you know, I didn't
quite know how I was gonna

handle it, but my main
thing was I was gonna

treat him as i
always treated him.

As my equal, as my friend,
and as my brother.

Fuck.

Lucille, this is some
heavy shit, man.

Five more.

-It's that green juice, man.
-Ah, it's something else.

That shit taste nasty,
but it's doing something.

It's something else, man.
It's something else.

It's running
through my blood.

It's a new energy.

I don't know what it is.

It's scary, man.

Don't be scared of it.

Let it flow.

You doing this
shit again, ain't you?

See? He can do
anything, man.

Anything.

That's what I'm
talking about, Melvin.

You getting back
to yourself.

Look like you did when you
was in your twenties, huh?

That's right.

Stop showing off,
mother fucker.

Are you sure this
is the block, or?

Yeah, man. She come
this way all the time.

Wait til you see her.

Mm!

What?

I'm just looking at you.

Is that a problem?

You looking at me like
you don't believe me.

Of course I believe you.

You said you see her every
day, she's obviously late.

Just give it a
little time, man.

Give it a little time.

Something that fine
need a little time.

It's like wine.

You know, we could just
come back another day, too.

It's no big deal.

Damn.

I really thought I had a
shot with this one, man.

You may, Luc.
Come on.

Maybe she's sick.

She's at home. She...

You'll find her.

Eh, man, fuck it,
man. Come on.

-Let's go.
-Really?

-Yeah, man. Fuck it.
-You done?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

I knew your ass was good for
something, mother fucker.

She is beautiful, Luc.

I wasn't bullshitting, was it?

Hell no.
She's fine.

Man, I'll tell you, I'll wait
out here fifteen hours for that.

Shit, she just
looked back.

Don't look.
Don't look.

-Alright.
-Just be cool.

We should just
peel out of here.

Yeah, she's looking

Don't look anxious, right?

No, no, no. We gonna

We can't be, you know...

Alright, I'm in

Man, the brother is getting

Good on you then, brother.

I'm proud of you.

You're a good man, Mel.

Yeah.

I, however, am not

And if I wake

I'm gonna consider this night
a mother fucking waste.

Hey, hey, hey.

He never remembers shit.

Don't take too long, guys.

Alright, man.

Stay out of trouble, man.

You know what this is?

I don't know.
You tell me.

It's sober hand.

Okay.

I'm sober.

When I was in the hospital,
i did a lot of thinking.

All the things
you were saying.

Lucille's been
telling me for years.

And I'm ready.

I'm ready to do some
good in this community.

Is that why you show up to
crime scenes and relieve

the suspects of
their stolen goods?

Come on, man.

That was then,
this is now.

I've been through
something.

No fucking around.

I wanna help you.

Really?

Ready to take on
that responsibility?

Yes.

Tell me what you
want me to do.

I always knew you'd
be the one, Melvin.

Your natural abilities,
the shit you can do.

I've known you for years.

It's still amazing.

Hey, what's up, bitches?

That's the shit I'm dealing
with every god damn day.

You know that mother
fucker peddles rock and

smack to kids not much
older than your son.

Yeah, I know.

That's why I'm here.

Thanks, Jimmy.

Thanks for believing
in me, buddy.

Be careful with Nathan.

He's a dangerous
mother fucker, man.

Alright.

-You ready?
-Yeah, I got this.

Melvin.

Shit.

I'm sorry, man.

You are not as ready
as you think you are.

What the hell

What you want?

Where's Nathan at?

Man, you know you don't
belong around here

so take your ass home.

Get Nathan down here now.

Say what, now?

So you giving me orders?

Man, get the fuck out of
here before you get hurt.

I'm not moving.

Maybe this'll help you.

Oh yeah?
Go for it.

Make your move.

Make your fucking move.

Ooo!

What you got?

You got a piece
back there?

Bring it.

Man, how the
fuck you do that?

You tell Nathan
i wanna see him.

Anytime, anywhere.

Bunch of fucking
pussies, hurting kids.

This is just a small
way of saying welcome

to our home, Ryan.

It's Melvin's
favorite cake.

I'm really thrilled that
he has decided to make

certain positive changes.

Come on, mom. Please?

-Well, I am.
-Mom, that is embarrassing.

Stop.

Thank you so much for
welcoming me into your

lovely home, miss hesper.

Melvin, would you like
to personally greet ry?

Oh, love to.

You hurt my sister, I'm gonna
break your fucking jaw.

Melvin, language.

Oh my god!

Eh, I'm just
kidding you, buddy.

Sorry, Ryan, let me just
apologize for my mentally

handicapped brother
who's a total dick.

Ryan.

How hungry are
you feeling?

It certainly
looks delicious.

I'll take a
healthy size piece.

Thank you very much.

Well, you do have
lovely manners.

I appreciate a young man
who knows how to say

please and thank you.

And where's your
delightful accent from?

I'm originally from
Oklahoma, miss hesper.

Well, please
call me Eileen.

-I insist.
-Stop it.

No, me and the kids father,
we went up to Oklahoma once.

-It was--
-what the hell is going on?

-Seriously, can you stop?
-Melvin.

And we were in this
like yellow Cadillac.

And it was just
so much fun.

What the fuck!

Ryan, language please.

-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Melvin.

-Stop showing off.
-I have to go.

Wow, great.

Thank you.
Thanks, Melvin.

I swear to god, you
are such a penis!

What?

I thought that
went rather well.

I liked him.

She liked him.

I'm playing around, mom.

Jesus.

One evening where we could

just sit as a family and have
a nice little piece of cake.

Oh, come on.
I'm just...

Fuck.

Hey, man. Where the fuck
are you going now?

It's Lucille.

What is he?

I don't know.

I have no way of
explaining it.

-Where's 167?
-Right there.

Look, Mel, man,
you need to leave.

You can't be
around us, man.

-How is he?
-How is he?

Nathan walked up and
stuck a bullet in him

cause of something
you did, man.

Just walked up and shot
the cat outside my place.

I'm sorry, Luc.

I am so sorry, bro.

Hey, Mel, listen man.

If you're really sorry, the best
thing you can do is leave, bro.

Yeah, just get
the fuck it.

Fuck you, Lyle.

This is between
me and Lucille.

Yeah, but it's not between
you and Lucille anymore, bro.

It's between all of us.

You're the one who brought
us into this thing.

You need to walk away.

He's right.

I mean, you started a
war we can't fight, bro.

Hey.

Hey!

Promise me.

Mel, look what
you got us into.

Luc, talk to me.

Let me take
of you, brother.

Get the fuck out, Melvin.

Alright.

You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

Melvin.

Hey, Jimmy.

I thought you were
giving up the drink.

Some things
change, I guess.

You want a drink?

No.

Gotta get going.

Just wanted to say hello.

Alright, Jimmy.

Take her easy.

Lucille.

Lucille!

What the fuck you want?

I'm sorry.

Man, keep your
damn voice down.

I'm sorry.

You're drunk ain't
you, mother fucker?

God damn, Melvin.

I'm not talking to your
ass while you're drunk.

Just let me inside.

Man, get the hell away
from my house, man.

I'm tired of seeing
you like this, bro.

I love you, man.

Yo!

Hey.

What's up, Mel?

You look like shit.

What's going on?

Just wanna hang, man.

Who is it?

It's Melvin.

What does he want?

I don't want that mother fucker,
Nathan, showing up here.

Anybody follow you here?

Yeah, these babies.

How's he look, man?

He's wasted.

Really? Did he
bring any friends?

Brought a whole fucking
bag full of 'em.

You wanna party, Mel?

Get your ass up here, man.

What a fucking privilege.

Fucking a. We got our
old Melvin back.

Let's call someone.

Hey, man, we'll
call lots of people.

Oh, shit.

I'm happy to see you, man.

I'm happy to see
you, too, brother.

Did they fuck
with you in there?

A little bit, man.

Sexually, no?

Fuck you, man.

I don't know...

If it wasn't for Lucille, maybe
you'd be one of my best friends.

Fuck being sober!

To being fucking back.

When are the
bitches showing up?

-Fuck all this bullshit.
-Danny, where you going?

I'm putting music on.

I gotta pee.

She was fat.

No way. She wasn't fat.

Just cause a chick got big
hips and a big ass doesn't

make her fat.

Now, if she got fat
hips and a fat ass...

No, did you see the size
of those fucking tits?

Those are motor
boating tits.

Those are good tits.

Good tits for you.

You should did her, man.

It's the reason why
we're running late now.

Fucking liquor store's probably
not even open thanks to you.

Yo, Mel.

Is that you,
mother fucker?

Kiss my ass, Melvin.

Fuck you, man!

I ain't no bitch!

-Holy shit.
-Aye, yo! Let's go!

Are you hit, man?

-No.
-You alright?

Guys, we gotta get
the fuck out of here?

Just take me to Lucas's.

Dude, what's wrong, bro?

It's my heart.

Just get me there.

Fuck.

Mel. Mel, this is...

This is crazy.

I don't have a clue
what I'm looking for.

You really need to
see a specialist.

I'll be alright.

I just need to rest.

But you're not alright.

The more you're using your
abilities, the more it's

hurting you.

Oh, yeah?

Thought you said you
weren't a specialist?

Mel, look, I...

I wanna help, but I'm not
comfortable with this.

Son of a bitch.

You son of a bitch.

Son of a bitch.

Son of a bitch.

You are dumb playing
this game, mother fucker.

Yeah, man.

How's the arm?

I've had worse.

It's good to see you.

Likewise, man.

I worry about you.

Come here, ma.

Everything's
gonna be alright.

Impressed?

So?

Brother, you the only
mother fucker I know

that'll turn a Porsche
into a Nissan and still

feel good about himself.

Hey, Jimmy.

Hey.

How's Lucille holding up?

He's good.

He's doing better.

That's good.

Listen, um...

Just wanted you to know
it's gonna get noisy at

c-block later.

You need me?

When you get the
call, ignore it.

I got this.

Thanks, Jim.

Chopin, vagner,
Beethoven, Mozart.

You know what they
all have in common?

They're Europeans, man.

I mean, those cats had so
much history and culture

to draw from
when they wrote.

That's why their concertos are
still amazing to this day.

I mean, listen to that.

The changes, the notes,
the way it prociendos.

It's perfect.

I fucking love it.

We're here.

It's hot as a mother
fucker out here today.

Alright, man.
Let's go.

Oh, shit.

What the fuck?

Man, what the fuck, man?

Shit, all the
shit's coming out.

Take it and put
that shit in there.

Can't have the
feds see this, man.

Fuck, man.

-Ah!
-Shit!

I know you out here, you
magic mother fucker!

Come out!

Oh, you fuck...

Come on, Melvin!

I know you out there

Fuck!

What the fuck, man!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

You gonna fuck with me.

Alright, your

Kiss my ass, Melvin.

Come on!

Damn.

Fuck!

Yeah, I like
seeing you run.

Fuck you, man.

Yeah!

Crazy motherfucker!

Done, motherfucker.

This is gonna be fun.

Hide and seek time,
mother fucker.

I remember playing this
when I was a kid.

I love seeing you run.

Here I come!

I heard something happened
to that mother fucker Nathan.

I think he got the message.

I got somewhere
i wanna take you.

Where is that?

You gotta know everything.

Man, I'm playing
like a salad up here.

A what?

A salad.

Getting tossed all
over the damn place.

Gotta do something
about these roads.

I gotta get me a new
set of legs that work.

Yeah, or a new
chair that works.

Ain't nobody gonna buy me
a new chair, my brother.

I'm stuck in this old beat up
raggedy mother fucker for life.

You ready?

I been ready.

For me?

Yeah, it's for you.

Look at that.

Chrome.

White leather.

You even put an l on it.

Well, shit! Don't just stand

Help me in the mother
fucking vessel.

Get that break on.

-You ready?
-Yeah.

-You got me?

Bang.

Oh, yeah.

You got suspension.

A cold one.

Oh, look at that, man.

You thought of everything.

Bmx wheels.

Get that shit
out of the way.

Yeah, let me get rid of this.

Give it a test drive.

Woo, baby!
Look at this thing!

Uh!

Oh, hell yeah!

You like those wheels?

I love these wheels, man.

We can go off-roading
with these.

You already know.

I know.

Well, let's go
mother fucker.

Push me somewhere. Shit.

Get my roll on.

Get my stroll on.

Rolling up with
the l on the back of my

chair with no fears,
crystal clear, my dear.

Here he come, here he come
just having a little fun

and it's only just begun
underneath the sun.

Give him some legs,
give him some new wheels.

What you say, boy?
Coppin' those pills

I'm Lucille,
you'll cop a pill.

Even though my
legs I can't feel.

Hi, Doreen.

Can I talk to
you for a second?

Melvin.

You're breaking the law by
being within one hundred

yards of me.

I know.

I just need a...

Just need a minute.

Melvin, you got ten
seconds to back away

before I call the cops.

Call the cops.

I got nothing
to lose anymore.

I'm lonely.

Hm, that's what happens when
you screw your marriage up.

I just wanna see Rex.

Wanna walk home from
school and see his face.

Smell him.

I just want him to know
that I'm here in case

something really
does happen to me.

How do you sit here and
pretend to care when you're

the one who stopped helping
with his child support?

I never stopped.

I put money in the bank.

Come on, Mel.

Please let's not
play me for the fool.

Doreen.

I got four thousand
dollars in Rex's name

right here and
there's more coming.

I just wanna see my boy.

Just let me walk
him home once.

Come on.

I gotta be insane.

Here we go!

Yippee!

Hey, you.

Yes?

Where's my little man?
Where is he?

I don't see him.

-Here I am!
-Where are you?

Hey!

Daddy, go faster.

You wanna go faster?

-Alright.
-Yeah.

Well, what do you know.

Well, what do you
