 

 

Down 'scope.

Take it down Mr Davis.
Aye Captain.

Helm! Ahead two thirds!
Left 25 degrees rudder!

Ahead two thirds, left
25 degrees rudder.  Aye!



Make your depth at 1000 feet.



Rig for silent running. 
We're heading into soviet waters.

<i>Con Sonar, how's that give me that 
1506 boom for an air loren.</i>


Sonar Con, set fathometer to 
automatic sounding every ten seconds.

Palmer initiate bottom contour mapping.

Boomer, underize sonar.  
Ahab, start scanning for 
low freq prop noises.

First one to bag a Russian 
boomer gets a case of Highlight.

That beer is mine!

Con Sonar gain new broadband 
contact bearing 3-2-5.

Sonar Con identify contact.

Contact is unknown... 

... setting tracker 2A and 
calculating solutions.
Con Sonar... there's nothing!

No sir, you're wrong.

<i>There's definately 
something out there!</i>

Contact now bearing 2-2-5.
What's going on Bill?

Nothing, sir.  Seaman A has 
just picked up a thermal up vent.

No, sir, that's' not what it was!

Give me a headset.

Contact now angling down.

Sonar, I'm not hearing anything.

It's not really a sound, sir.

It's more of an emptiness.

Like a hole in the water.

Give me continuous range reports
on close abort contact.

Aye aye, sir.

You don't even drink!

<i>Depth is 1500 feet
and rising.</i>

What is it, sir?
I didn't hear a damned thing, Doc

But what if it's one of those new yankee 
class boats intel's been chattering about?

The Reds may have solved their noise problem.

They may have solved their depth problems.
Con Sonar...

... working bottom readings.

Close aboard, contact, still diving.

What the hell is going on?
It's the YKD.  
It's going into the trash.

Depth is 1700 and rising.

No, we're done.  Disengage!
Level at 1700.

Level again, 1700, aye.

But sir, he's still down there.

I'm not driving my boat into a tunnel after an...

... imaginary bogie 
a seaman may have.

We'll take pictures.
And send your tape to Norton.

Maybe the spooks can figure out 
what the hell you saw.

Up Perascope.

Swing us around to the mouth of
the trench... nice and slow!

Aye aye, Captain.

Say cheese.

All heads to the battle stations!



Boomer.

Boomer, you there, man?
Come on, get up!

No, no!

Shit.

Doc

Doc

Doc!

Doc

Call me Michelle.
Right, sorry, Michelle.

They're here.

Let's see if it works.
Did you get fired?

I... didn't get fired.
I'm on the symbatical.

What's up with this broken boat?

The institution had some doubts 
about the validity of my research.

Because you talk to whales?

If you say it like that, 
then I do sound crazy.

Am I gonna get paid?

I don't know... it depends on 
if you can get that engine fixed.
Please.

<i>Initiating whalesong generator.</i>

We got birds. 
That's a good sign.

Alright, I got a signal.

Ok

Initiating sample HB-12-A.

The native call of the 
large male humpback whale.

We're using 160 decibels. 
Since the speed of sound...

is four times faster
under water...

We expect to attract females from
hundreds of miles away.

Just like me.

Actually, the other purpose of the 
whalesong generator is to warn whales 
to stay away from hazardous areas.

For example, Navy sonar, 
which is so powerful...

that it's irritating.  
It's even harmful to the whale's 
natural ability to navigate...

Michelle!
The whale's behavior is completely modified
to avoid potentially deadly situations...

Michelle!
Look.

Look.

Look.

Michelle, look!

Look.
Look.

We did it.
It worked?

It works!
We did it.

We did it.
It worked.

Oh, my God.
Look, look?

Oh, my God!
It worked! It worked!

OK, ok, um, um...

uh sample.
30-31-32

Right, right, 31... 30-31-32

There!  Look!  They're reacting!
Here comes another.

They're, they're pumping.

Oh, I can't believe it.

Where they all going?

Something must've spooked them.

Yes

Where are they going?

Turn it off.
Turn it OFF!
Turn it off!

Okay, I'm getting it.
Okay, alright.

There's something down there.

Maybe we should get out of here.

Oh, my God.

Dr. Michelle Herman.

I'm Lieutenant-Commander Starbuck, USS Pequod. 
I need you to come onboard, ma'am.

Why?
Everything will be explained 
once we're on our way.

No, I'm not getting on that thing.

I'm afraid I must insist,
ma'am.

Oh, okay.

Wait.

Look, ok, look.
Captain.

I'm not the Captain,
I'm the executive officer.

Alright, then can I speak to 
your superior?

Captain Ahab is not feeling well...

but I have orders to commandeer 
your equipment and your services.

And what if I refuse?

Then in accordance with the 
suspension clause Article 1...

Section 9 of the 
United States Constitution...

I will order these gentlemen 
to compel you to cooperate.

Pip, call the institution and ask them...

My lawyer's name is Mihad.

I'm afraid Mr. Pippin will 
be joining us.

Say What!
Take the equipment below.

Alright, what about my boat?
stow it on board.

Oh, and Ma'me...

... Would you mind covering up?

We've been deployed for 5 1/2 months
and well... the men.

Oh, just brilliant.

<i>All men, all men,  
Prepare to dive! Prepare to dive!</i>

<i>Say it again! Prepare to dive!</i>

<i>All men, all men,
Prepare for diving stage!</i>

<i>Repeat, all men, all men, 
Prepare for diving stage!</i>

<i>All men stand by to dive!</i>

<i>All men stand by to dive!</i>

This is Mr. Stubb, the
chief of the boat.

Where you want to put her, sir?
That's a good question.

What about the Captain's bed.
What... what?

Good idea, Mr. Queequeg

About a week 
after we deployed...

... the captain ordered his 
mattress removed 
from his quarters.

... said it was too 
comfortable to sleep on.

We're storing it 
in the torpedo room.

There's good space in there.

If you don't mind sharing it with 
6 tons of high explosives.

Chief Queequeg will escort you down
to the control room for a debrief.

This way ma'am.

Watch your head.

All men, all men, prepare to dive!

Are you alright?
Yeah.

Welcome aboard the whale tail, folks.

Sit right back while we 
enter whale territory.

And we'll be cruising at an 
altitude of approxiamately 0 feet.

I can already smell the blubber.

Alright now, keep an eye out there folks, 
and remember...

... it's peak mating season and 
we've got Grays and Humpbacks all up 
in these waters around here.

Now, we're gonna be heading out deep...

... So if it gets a little choppy, 
you all might wanna hold on.

Now you folks all got your 
cameras rolling, right?

Yeah, you probably don't know 
what the hell I'm saying, do you?

That's alright. 
I get paid just the same anyway.

Alright folks, well we're gonna slow this 
puppy on down here and just slowly shut her off.

And uh, well, here we are.
Welcome to the sweet spot 
ladies and gentlemen.

I bring my guests out here and 
I never miss. I'll tell ya.

Just keep an eye out there and as a 
matter of fact, uh, over there on  
the right, well, there you go!

Oh there she blows, right over there,
off the starboard bow.

That's right for you land lovers.

Take a look at that!
She is beautiful

Yeah, she's definately a lady.

Females are usually bigger than 
males by about 50 feet, and...

this one's definately a female.

I'll be honest with you folks: 
that is the biggest whale I've ever seen.

So she's sounded and it looks like, uh oh...
I think this is gonna be a full breach.

'Cause she's going down pretty far.

Now, I've been doing this for almost 20 years 
and I've only seen a full breach once.

She's under water now...
She's coming up.

Get your cameras ready.

Huh! I'm a little excited myself.

Uh, she is something else.

Eyes on your stations men.

Carry on Mr. Flask.
Take her to test level.

Aye, Helm, full speed ahead.
Depth, make her 800 feet.

What's this all about?
Allow me to explain?

Two weeks ago...

a Norweigan fishing trawler 
capsized in the Chuckchi Sea.

Five days later, 
an offshore oil rig was... 

sunk just off the coast 
of Ketchikan Alaska.

And just two days ago a 
merchant ship went down...

near port Angeles Washington.

Eye witness reports say that all 
were attacked by an enormous whale.

Right, well that's just ridiculous...

because this is completely inconsistent 
with the Physeter macrocephalus.

What are these lines right over there?
That's a statimetre.

Each mill represents a meter.

But... no...

Well then how close is 
the whale in the shot here?

50 meters or so.
But, then that would make it what, 400 feet?

More like 5.
Okay, that's, that's just not possible.

I don't know what this is,
but it's not a sperm whale.

Did we pick up the wrong scientist?

The largest known sperm whale 
is 85 feet in length.

This is 6 times the length of that and 
if you really look at it, I mean the...

size of the head and 
then the jaw line... 

see whales, they don't have 
the teeth that jot up...

So what do you think it is?

I...

I mean... there's conjecture, 
that some whale species that are... 

thought to be exstinct, but...

they may actually live 
in the lower depths of the Arctic.

Which is why we'll need you 
and your device to track it down.

Well it's not that simple you see, 
because the whalesong generator, it has...

this specific auditory algorythm,
and I don't know the...

sound of this whale.

I do.
Captain on deck!

I have his signature and clicks, here.

It says 1969.
Moby Dick is older than that.

Moby dicks?

You've heard of him, Chief?

Anyone who's spent time at sea, 
has heard of Moby Dick, Captain.

It's a particularly 
large and vicious whale -

his hide covered 
with thousands of scars and...

... corkscrewed remains 
of countless harpoons.

Most Sailors swear 
that Moby Dick is both...

omnipresent and immortal.

Of course, most of those 
sailors are usually drunk.

Moby Dick is real.

I've seen him with my own eyes.

It was Moby Dick who 
took my leg in '69.

And it's Moby Dick 
who I mean to find now!

Oh Wait...

You're going to take revenge on an animal?

I'd strike the son if it insulted me.

Wait...

It's just a mask.

It's the thing behind 
the mask that I seek.

Maybe it's nothing.

But then, animal or not.

I will find it.

I read your dissertation on biomass estimation 
and echolocation, and I have been following 
your work in citations and miotics for years.

If anyone could track 
an individual whale, it's you.

I won't be part of a hunting expedition.

We just want to stop the attacks.

Alright.

Here you are sir.

Captain Enderby's here, sir.
Thank you, Winson.

At ease, Captain.  
Have a seat.

Scotch?

09:00, sir.
Make it a small.

Boomer what can you tell me 
about Captain Jonah Ahab? Sir?

You served with him didn't you?
Twice.

Yes, I mean the second time.

I was intelligence officer when
he was skipper of the Jeroboam.

Good CO?
It was a long time ago, sir.

What's this about?

You know Ahab 
Captains the Pequod now?

New modified Virginia class.

Modified by Ahab himself.

The most advanced boat in the fleet.

Next generation
weapon system.

Reinforced pressure hold.  Top of the line 
survaillence and counter-survaillence equipment.

What's the problem, sir?

Ahab missed his last 
radio check-in 7 days ago.

That's not unusual for a fast attack.

He could be tracking an enemy sub.

Navpak set, picked him up when 
he surfaced twice in the last week:

once off the coast of Alaska,

and again this morning near MBSD.

Plus...

There've been incidents.

What kind of incidents.

Sinkings...

A Norweigan trawler, an oil rig...

and this morning, a whale 
watching boat, off Point Mugu...

for Christ's sake.

And you think
Ahab is responsible?

That's what I need you to find out.
Yes sir.

We have every ship in U.S. Pack 
home searching for the Pequod.

The USS X6 in the area
with orders to engage.

We can not have a sub commander...

off the reservation, with 
a boat load full of nukes.

There was a survivor
off that whale boat.

Get to the hospital, and find out 
if they have what's the cause of it.

Am I clear?
Aye, Aye, sir.

Good hunting, Captain.

It's just completely jammed.

Give me your little tape recorder.
That's not going to work.

This is a micro cassette.
Give it to me.

Okay.

We only need the
first ten minutes.

Gotta learn how to do this 
with what I can only find.  

I'd break out one with 
only an eight track.

woo!

Put this here.

And put this over there.

And go like that.

Alright
And here you go.

Your 1969 mix tape

You are genius.

That's true.
Red.

Keeping the depth to 60 feet.

Radio Con imploy antenna
scan on all frequencies.

Omit that!  We don't want to expose 
ourselves any longer than we have to.

Aye, sir.

Sir! Reading cavitations 
from an Ohio class boat.
Identifying now.

What are they doing in the area?

A better question is who?
Doughby, let me hear it.

It's Pollard.

Aye, sir.

Neurobank confirms: the 
target is the USS ESSEX.

She's 105 nautical miles south.

Report!

Possible target, 
225 degrees north.

Is it the Pequod?

Can't tell, sir.

Sonar is still trying to identify.

You have the target yet?
Negative, sir.

Switch to active sonar.

Sir?  Expose our position?
Ping the son-of-a-bitch!

Sir, the ESSEX has gone to active sonar.

I'm reading a large  biological 
mass closing in on the ESSEX.

Helm, all ahead flank!  
Intersect course on the ESSEX!

Aye, Captain.
All ahead flank, sir.

Even at full speed it will take 
over 4 hours to reach that destination.

Those men are already dead.

Give me continuous reports 
on the status of the ESSEX.

I've got echo.  
Calculating Team A.

Fire Control, 
flood tubes 1 and 3.

Sir, 
this doesn't look like a sub.

It's probably 
one of Ahab's tricks.

Tubes 1 and 3 are 
flooded and equalized.

Target is diving 9-0 degrees.

Dive 45 degrees, bubble down.

Don't lose it.
45 degrees down bubble.

Aye!
Target is accelerating.

Sir, target's going out of range.

Sir, we're going to lose our shot.

Sir...

Commence fire in tube 1.

Torpedo 1 responding and 
closing on target - 300 meters.

Report.

200 meters and closing.

I've got bottom echo.  
He's heading for a sea mount.

Torpedo can't get a...
Come on!

Still no luck, sir.

Tell me we got him.
Negative.

Torpedo hit the sea mount.

Sir, I don't think this is Pequod.
What the hell is this thing?

What's it doing now?

It's just lying there.

Helm, ahead two thirds!  
Close the gap!

Torpedo tube 3 is ready.

Setup is good for curb fire.

Shoot!
Fire 3.

Torpedo missed.
Torpedo still running.

Target is turning.

We have target alligned.

Target is biological.
That's impossible!

It's gonna ram us!

Fire control.
Report.

Torpedo still running.

Evasive action!
All ahead flank!
Left full rudder!

We're clear.

No we're not.

Enderby.
Are you at the hospital?
Yes sir, I'm just arriving 
at the hospital now.

<i>Boomer listen.  It may be nothing,
but we're getting reports...

that a Marine Biologist
has disappeared in San Diego.

A Marine Biologist?

We have eye witness reports that 
she's abducted by A black submarine.

Alright, send me what you got.

Here comes.

How long before she was picked up?

She was in the water almost 4 hours.

She's suffering from exposure, 
dehydration, and sunburn.

What did she say happened?
I don't know, she only speaks Russian.

Hello!

My name is John.

Would you like a drink?

No thanks.

Are you sure you won't like a drink?

Suit yourself.

Can you tell me what happened?
It attacked us...

Go ahead.

from under the sea.

What did it look like?

Was the ship black?

It was white.

I cleared the tape hiss and 
I'm applying the DNR now.

Ok, everything is clear,
except for the source.

Initiating playback.

I don't hear anything.
shhh...

It's not a sound.
It's more like the absence of sound.

Like a hole in the water.
Yes.

It's his voice.

What's that screaming?

Captain, we've reached the 
last recorded position of the ESSEX.

Sonar what have you got?

No contact, sir.

What the hell was that?
All stop.

Stop it, all engines.  Aye!

Activate the photonic band.

Give me some light!

Patch this through to the ship BITE system.

All hands, this is your Captain.
Look at your screens.

Look at the face of your brothers.

This could have been you.

And it still might be.

The men of the ESSEX 
were only doing their duty.

And now we must do ours.

The thing that did this to them, is...

the thing that we're after.

Moby Dick.

I have orders to find him, 
to stop him...

before he can kill again.

We are going to chase him, 
from here to the Atlantic.

We're going to chase him 
to hell if we have to.

And When we find him,
we're gonna make him pay.

He's going to feel the sting of our hate.

And when we're done with him, he will 
spout black and roll in his own blood.

We owe this to the men of the ESSEX.
We owe this to ourselves!

And may God hunt us all, if we do 
not hunt Moby Dick to the death.

Are you with me, men?
Yes!

Do you feel brave?
Yes!

Marine?

Yes, sir!

Can I help you?

What's your name, son?
Mace Corporal Perth.

Mace Corporal Perth, 
I need a ride.

Do you have clearance for that?

Colonel!

Anything else I can do for you, sir?

I can use a driver.

Brian.

There's nothing.

Try to seduce him.

I'm... 
I'm still not hearing anything.

There's nothing out there.

Why don't you get some rest?

What time is it?
About 3am.

Are you serious?
Yeah, you must have missed the sunset.

Come on, 
I'll show you back to your quarters.

Oh no worries.  
I'll just take a nap here.

Admiral...

I have Captain Enderby...
Boomer what the hell is going on out there?

I don't know yet.  
I need to find Ahab. 
I have to talk to him.

No, it is too late
for that, Captain.

Wall Banger picked up the thermal 
signature of an S-9-G reactor...

a thousand miles 
east off of Honolulu.

The ESSEX was in the area 
and now she's gone missing.

Seano has declared Pequod an aggressor.

We do have the USS summers in the
vicinity and she has an entire 
wing searching for them now.

I called in a favor of a first Marine.
I can be there in four hours.

In four hours the Pequod will 
be at the bottom of the ocean.

Captain Enderby?
Yeah.

Captain Brian Tashtego.

Where to, Captain?
That way.

Woah!

What's going on?

Sonar spotted a biologic 
mass 10 miles off the stern.

Contact bearing 215 and closing.

Mark, contact heading and 
calculating firing solution.

Engines at one third!
Sir!

We wanted to catch it Mr. Starbuck.

Engines, one third, aye sir!

Come on.

Con radio, ESM is picking up 
an unidentified aircraft...

80 nautical miles north north west and closing.

Pequod, this is Sierra Victor 19er.
Come in.

Pequod, if you do not respond,
we will be forced to open fire.

Ah... he's bluffing,
he can't see us.

We're locked on your 
position and intercepting now.

Sir?

50 miles to spread the target.

Sonar, Report!

The biological target is 5 miles 
of stern and still on intercept.

The signature's not right.

The target is 600 feet and organic.

What else could it be.

Helm, left full rudder, 
engine starboard ahead two-thirds.

Port back full.

Left full rudder, Aye!

Captain...

He took my leg.
I don't intend to give him my ass.

Sir, I'm intending to speak 
and expose our position.

Permission to enter grid.

Permission granted.

Activate perameters.

Let's make sure he knows we're serious.

Activating.

They're firing at us.

Sir, I demand an explanation!

Torpedo, this is the captain,
subrocks 1 and 2.

What is a subsrock?
Basically a nuclear torpedo.

Damage Report!
I designed her, Mr. Starbuck.
The hull will hold.

The target is still bearing 2-1-5
and 3 miles due north.

Sir, we have a lock on Moby Dick.

Captain it's not Moby Dick.

You may fire when ready Mr. Que.

Fire one.

Incoming missile.
Summers, this is Sierra. 
We are under attack.

Subrock aiming at target.

100 meters to target.

50 meters to target.

What the hell was that.
Nuclear detonation, sir

Sonar report.
The target is...

destroyed! 
I think you got Moby dick, sir.

Now bring her back around.

If you can hear me, 
congratulations, Pequod.

You nuked a school of squid.

Where there are squid, 
there are whales.

Prepare to launch torpedoes.
Sir!

Moby Dick is close.
I can feel it.

Why were they shooting at us?

Why were they shooting at us?

It's time to earn your keep, Doc.

I need to see our orders, sir.

Our orders, sir!

In accordance with Article 5
Section 1-1-5...

Wait, Mr. Starbuck.

Look at those men.

Even now, you can see that
they are still with me...

They're still ready to hunt
Moby dick 'til the end.

Have you forgotten...  
all about the ESSEX?

Will you let those 
men's death go unavenged?

But sir?
I personally selected you.

There's not another man in this 
Navy that I would trust my boat to.

I can't do this without my XO.

Mr. Starbuck you have the con.

Bring that canister over here.

The steel was fashioned 
from the hull of the Acushnet.

Moby Dick can only be taken by 
something that has touched him.

And this thing that's 
connected to him...

is the thing that's 
going to kill him.

Admiral, did they find him?
Oh, they found him.

He shot down one of summers' 
seahawks with subrock.

Sir, that doesn't make any sense.

If he wanted to shoot down 
an aircraft, why wouldn't he 
use one of his tomahawks?

Captain, the man has stolen 
a 2. billion dollar submarine. 

You think he's 
thinking rationally?

That may be true Admiral, 
but he isn't stupid.

I'm within an hour of the 
Summer's location.  Just 
give me a chance to talk to him.

The only way that's going to 
happen, is if you get there 
before anyone else does.

Then sir, 
give me the exact coordinates 
of that nuclear detonation.

Would you tell me 
what's going on, sir?

Ever hear of Moby Dick, Captain?

It's him.
It's him.

I don't hear anything.
He's less than a 
mile away bearing 1-2-5.

Doughby?
There's a cruise ship, 
but that's all.

Maintain present course...

It's him.

Right full rudder.  
Come around fast.  
Make your heading 1-2-5.

Aye sir!
Right full rudder, 1-2-5.

Something just collided 
with the cruise ship.

He's coming back around.  I 
think he's going to hit again.

Why would a whale 
act like this?

Oh, why do babies 
die in their sleep?

Mr Que, status report?

Still out of effective 
firing range, Captain.

That ship won't stand 
another direct hit.

If he rams here again.
She's going down.

Pip, I want to take this 
signal and put it to output.

Give me all the power you can.

Alright, I got it.
Go, go.

Executing BAW-7-2.
Now.

What the hell did you do?

It worked. He's turning.
Very good Doctor.

Where's she heading now?

Straight toward us.

Mr. Que, prepare number 1.

Prepare tube 1 and  
wait for my command.

Tube 1 ready.

He's 2 km and closing.
Fedallah is ready to fire, sir.

No, no, no, not yet. 
Not yet, Mr. Que.

One kilometer.

He's coming straight for us.

Captain.
Wait.

700 meters.

300 meters.

150 meters.
Captain, you have to swerve.

100 meters.

50 meters.

Fire.

Firing.

<i>We have flooding!

We've lost 4 diving plates.
Report heavy flooding to the VLS.

What's he doing?
He's sounding.

Get ready for a ride.

All hands, brace for impact.

All engines on hold!


Engines not responding.

Our depth is
1500 and lowering.

Sir, we have to cut loose.

Let's see how deep he can take us.

1800 feet.

How deep can this ship go?
It's classified.

How deep have you been?

2100 feet.

This.

Sir, we have to disconnect.
2750 feet.

We've gone too deep.
It will hold.

3000 feet.

It's higher.

3200 feet.

Sir...

You are responsible for the 
lives of 130 men on this ship.

You have to stop this.

Sir, we've lost the tether.

Grrr!

Tell him to take us up?

The engines still not responding, sir.

We're at 3500 feet and lowering.

All hands, brace for emergency pull.
Pull the tanks.  Pull them now.


According to the data, the 
detonation was right in this area.

See, you're heading west.
Towards Hawaii?

That's where he's driving.

Who's driving who, sir?

Would you call this a normal day?

No.

I see whales every day.

But I've never experienced 
anything like that.

It's the whiteness of the whale
that freaks me out the most. 
You know what I mean?

White is for the good guys.

I have no problem
seeing the whitest woman.

Engines are tested operational...

But the valve plates are out of commission.

We won't be able to go much past Perascope depth.

Thank you Chief.

<i>Officer of the deck radio. 
Picking up a distress call from the cruise ship Rachel.  
They have personnel over board.  
They are requesting assistance.</i>

Report to the Rachel and tell them 
we will proceed to their location.

I don't believe it.

He's taunting me.
Sir.

Clear the deck Mr Starbuck.
We're going after him.

Captain, what about the Rachel?

We're less than a 
hundred miles from Hawaii.  

Could you imagine the destruction
if that thing makes it into Pearl Harbour.
Sir...

I will not put the security 
of the United States Navy...

or the safety of a quarter
million people at risk...

Not when I finally have 
the chance to stop it.

Rachel can defend for herself.

Aye, Aye, sir.

Then clear the deck, Mr. Starbuck.
We have a whale to catch.

God help us all.

All hands, battle stations, 

prepare all torpedoes to 
switch to active sonar.

We're not hiding anymore, gentlemen.

Helmsman, all ahead full.

And don't let him get away from us.

Doughby, where's he at?

Target is 100 yards
north at 25 knots, sir.

Too close for torpedoes.

Engines two-thirds.

Engines two-thirds, Aye sir.

Give us some... a little bit of room.

Target is maintaining 100 yards, sir.

He knows.

He knows.

You give this whale too much credit.

No, he's not a whale.
He's the devil himself!

Captain.

Look at this.

There's an atoll, a narrow, open reef 
about two miles north of here.

That's Tau Pi atoll, I know it.

We can force Moby Dick 
into the reef.

Then capture him over here.

Helm, all ahead full.

All ahead full, aye sir.

Into the belly of the beast.

Target's turning starboard.

It's working.

We're approacing the atoll.

Yeah, yeah! 
Drive it into him boys!
Come on!

Drive it into him!
Aye, sir.

The target is 60 north,
north, north, west, sir.

Engines, give him 
everything you've got.

We hit the bottom.

What a clever fish.

He's led us right 
into the shallows.

He's going to turn around.
He's hitting us again.

Ah!  You don't give him 
enough credit, Doctor.

Fire torpedoes.

Negative, tubes are blocked.

Two engine warning!
Engines back full!

There! There they are right there!
Are you serious?!

Fire.
Fire.

Sir, who's in that plane?

Come back around.

Swing around!
Okay, hang on.

The target is 100 yards from the atoll.

50 yards.

Pull up.

Pull up.

Pull up!

<i>The Osprey is down.

He's in.

He went in.

Deploy a search team to see if anyone 
in the osprey survived the crash.

Send a fire volley 
into the lagoon, sir.

No chief, we're 
going in after him.

Sir, the opening is only
12 feet deep.

We're too tall.
Ah.

We'll face him like 
our ancestor's did.

Prepare the zodiacs.

What the hell is going on now?

Enter.

I know you.
You're Captain Boomer.

Ahab.

Oh what a pair we are.

Arm and leg together again.

It's time to stop, Jonah.

Half of the Navy
is looking for you.

And when they find you, they 
won't hesitate to destroy you.

I've waited for 
years for this day.

I built the Pequod for this one purpose.  
I won't stop now.

I can't.
Moby Dick has seen to that.

How?

How, how could you ask me that?


You of all people?
Moby Dick took just as much from you 
as he did from me?

Have you forgotten what it was like 
to sit out on that sea ice, and ...

watch your arm go gangerinous 
while we were waiting to be rescued?

I haven't forgotten it.
And months of surgery -
the years of rehabilitation...

wondering, 
why this happened to you?

Asking yourself, what kind of 
a God could allow such a thing?

And then coming to the conclusion 
that he was either malicious or dirt.

And then realizing...

You don't know which is worse.

Such a thing cannot 
be allowed to live.

I think Moby Dick took 
more from you, than from me.

Killing him won't 
bring back my arm.

It won't bring back your leg.

It won't bring any of it back!

And whether you succeed or fail... 

how many people need to die?

All of them.

This whole act has been decreed.

It's rehearsed by us a billion years 
before the oceans even rolled.

There's nothing I can do about it.

I am fates, Lieutenant.
And I act under orders.

Save your ammunition, Captain.  
You're gonna need it later.

Mr. Starbuck, 
give us two hours, no more.

So, keep the tubes and ready.

If I fail, or
Moby Dick tries to escape...

I want you to hit him 
with everything we've got.

We'll hit him and the island 
all to hell.

Aye, sir.

If I don't make it back, 
make sure this gets to the institution.

Oh, you better come back.

I still need to get paid...

Be safe.
Good luck.

Captain, I made this from the 
damaged valve plate, sir. 
Just as you ordered.

Careful, sir.

Now, you say it's 
properly tempered.

You're coming with us too?

You know, he's completely insane.

How can anyone endure 
this and not be?

Mr. Que, mine this opening team.
Aye, sir

Be careful, these mines 
are a little unpredictable.

Sonar, do you have a read on target?
Negative Con.

I can't see anything 
past the outer perimeter.

Any sign of him, Stubb?
Nothing, sir.

He must have gone to bottom.
This lagoon is deep.

Ahh, and now we're at the most...

He has to breathe.
He's a damned mammal.

Damn it.

What you want me to do?

They're birds.

What!
The birds.

He's under you.
He's right below!

He's under us!

Go, go, go, go!

We lost two zodiacs.

The third is heading to shore.

Did anyone make it shore?

I don't see how anyone could survive that.

Come on.
We're over here.

Moby dick has 
dismasted me once again.

But I am intact.

How many lost...

Stubbs?

Sammy Johnson and Medhi were killed.

Ensa Jogga was missing.

Archie Anchabacher on 
the other side were good, 
along with Captain Boomer.

We were able to keep much of 
our ammunition and firearms, sir.

Well, signal them to 
move about the perimeter... 

and then we'll meet 
them in the center.

Aye sir.

Well, it seems like we're destined to 
see this thing through together, doctor.

What is this place?

Taipi with a lepre colony.
This gets better and better.

Hand me that cross up there 
that says Mapples on it.

Mapples was a priest who tended to this site 
until he died of the disease himself in 1851.

Hey!

You believe in omens, men?

They say a drowning thing will 
go down and rise up again, twice...

before going down forever.

Moby Dick has already been down twice.

So have you.

Ah, this sucks!
You rather be out there?

Yeah, I guess you're right.

As far as I'm concerned...

You gonna have a whale hunt, it's better 
to do it from the safety of the land.

Hey, I see them.

Hey!

Hey!

Stop!

Come back!

Get on your feet, sailor!
Come on!

Small arms fire.

It's close.

Come on.

Get down!

It tasks me.
That whale tasks me.

This is your fault!

You're hunting it.
He's not hunting us!

Hey, look at me!

Don't move.

The Sh... the ship.

Captain?

Sir, the last zodiac
is leaving the beach.

For heaven's sake!
I spit my last breath at you!

Sir...

We've lost communication
with our last zodiac.

Sir, target is turning.

Target is down here this way.

Torpedo Con, 
prepare 1 through 4.

Target is 250 yards from entrance and closing.

200 yards.

150 yards.

100 yards sir.
Sir!

Sir!
Torpedo Con fire 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Will the mines stop him?

If they don't, 
the torpedoes certainly will.

Wasted our mines, it is down.

We missed.

We have to get out of here.

You won't make it.

Are you giving up?

No... surrendering.

You can't outrun a torpedo.

I can try.

Can you read me?

Sir...

Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

9-11 was an inside job!
