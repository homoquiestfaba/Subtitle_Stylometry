FEIVELYNE YOLANDA YAFFA

After having sailed a perilous trip, 
I enjoyed again a quiet life. 

But soon I was tired and longed
for oceans and adventure. 

= = The report on my fifth trip begins here. 

MANY YEARS LATER

A very familiar scent of darkness and evil filled the air. 

I can not even hear voices.

It is... black magic, Captain Sinbad.

We die if we go ashore.

-Let's Sail away from this place.
-We Should leave the port.

We do not know yet.
I am going to the palace.

-Zohreh! What happened?
-Take Your men with. We advocate.

NIGHT BEFORE

Sultan was like a father to me,
and the princess was my life. 

For His transcendent majesty and his hip

-Let me introduce wizard Hassan.

Their famous and unique Majesties.

I am honored being called to Maleks court.

Tonight I will give one forestilling-

-which gives thrill of joy of everyone who sees it.

This little box contains nothing but sand from my home.

But see how it shows us pictures from a reality in our time.

It was really amazing.

Tell Hassan how you perform such magic tricks?

-And What's in the box?
-Your Majesty, I promise...

... that the box contains only sand from my home.

But you must allow this humble sorcerer its secrets.

Humble? Do not be so modest.

My advisors say that you have amazing abilities, and it looks Mon.

My friend, I promise that you will be richly rewarded
at the end of this evening.

I am not in doubt Your Majesty.

With your permission, 
I will show my tricks for prinsessen-

-to celebrate her upcoming marriage with Captain Sinbad.

I wonder why he did not participate in this festive evening.

We sailed for many days and nights - 

-until we finally came to a large, uninhabited island. 

I thought we in any case. 

I can not leave the island without amulet Goddess.

It was a little too personally!

We have lots of gold and jewels.
What is so special about the amulet?

It must be my wedding to the princess. 
She dreamed of it.

And now you will meet her dreams.

Men give flowers.
I give magical amulets.

I wish that you did not waste
invisibility gift at a wedding.

You speak like a true thief, Firoozeh.

We sail for home.

With your permission, 
I will show my tricks for prinsessen-

-to celebrate her upcoming marriage with Captain Sinbad.

I wonder why he do not participate in this festive evening.

-V?rsgo.
-Prinsesse.

I can only imagine one thing which is a beautiful princess worthy.

Heaven.

For you, my butterfly.

I wish that this momentcould last an eternity.

Your Majesty has his way.

Parisa!

Parisa!

Follow me and take your men with.

-Zohreh, What happened?
-Do You life amulet with?

Give us the amulet.

But Parisa said that gave invisibility gift.

Her dream is not easily decipherable.

There is a reason it is called life amulet.

-Forr?deri!
-Your Highness. Zohreh told everything.

I'm afraid that he has taken her.

He is not interested in Parisas body.

It is her soul, he seeks.
He ??called the white deeve.

He is a dark wizard,
who drink the innocent souls.

If he steals the princess's soul...

... it would be better,
if she had never been born.

Where is this white deeve?
-On A large island called Masejonia.

It is a gloomy place.

The Witch explained
that I was the sultan's only hope - 

-and that I should travel to the
black desert within 40 days and nights. 

= = As we sailed into the unknown, was
thoughts about the princess everything I had. 

-Sinbad ship is almost ready.
-Is It?

I can never be together.
Learn to accept it.

None princess of Malek can love
an ordinary man. Such is the law.

There he is again!
Every day at the same place...

-... staring like a hungry dog.
-I Think about how he looks at me.

Guards, lower me down.

Do not worry, Zohreh.
The guards will protect me.

The guards are men.

None of them protects your virtue,
as I do, princess.

From now on you must think of
that you are a princess.

If you are determined
losing your head...

Who is calling me?

My eyes two watching the sea,
but on the beach he has an eye. 

Only with the heart that one can be free. 

"My eyes two watching the sea. "

My ship sank to the ocean floor. 

binoculars.

Is there anything on this island,
are not gigantic?

-In Fools, I do not know what you do.
-We Are starving.

Hungry men do not ask.
Taking.

Stop now. That's an order.

Abdul, listen to me.
She protects only its eggs.

Stand still.

You're doing it. Stand just quiet.

Back, back!

We go back to the camp.

Zohreh said that this country
is prehistoric.

We must be very careful
future.

Why did you let us not kill the bird?
-It Was not necessary.

Not necessary?
It was by killing Abdul.

Abdul still alive.

The kind of thinking makes us
to the true monsters, not them.

Yes, Captain.

Parisa, where are you now?

Alas, you dream of your loved Sinbad?

Princess.

Sinbad comes after me.
I have foreseen it.

His ship now rests on the ocean floor...

... and to swim to shore...

... is suicide.

What do you want?
-It's Not about what I want...

... but what will happen.

I show you...

... what it means.

No.

Captain.

-God Be praised, something to drink!
-It Appears to be honey.

I would lift a bowl,
but I have no water left.

-This Is an island. We will soon find water.
-Which Island has an infinite desert?

Where are the other shore?
Yes, where is it?

Was your tongues,
otherwise I crave death.

This is an island.
We will find water.

Then I will quench the thirst
with this honey.

Jamal, you do not know
whether it is toxic.

I'm sorry, Captain, but I...

No one moves. Stand still.

Running!

How many weavers
have been working on it?

It took several years to make,
but see it now - completely destroyed.

Why do we not stop
to hide?

Parisa, I'm not used to
navigate the sea in a woman's heart.

Women are not so difficult to understand.
We want simple things.

Also a princess puts
devotion higher than jewels.

A wink, a smile,
a poem that praises her now and then.

The bright moon reflected
in your radiant face.

Your snowy cheekbones
provides water and grace.

My heavy heart desires
an audience with you.

I appears.
I must return.

Your command, I catch it.

-I Called Sinbad...
-I know who you are and what you want.

Come in.

-Firoozeh?
-Sinbad!

-Kaptajn Where did you go?
-I Thought the monsters took you all...

... But I see that the villagers
has treated you well.

Yes, and they have also given us
much food and drink.

-Kaptajn, Let us drink.
-For Life.

Sinbad, Your Majesty.

My spies told that you have
met my daughter behind my back.

Your Majesty,
I admit with a merry

-that I love Princess Parisa and makes
anything to marry her.

Say what it takes, because I'm...

Sinbad! I've heard about you.

My daughter has told
that you have always treated her compensation

-and that her love
is like yours.

It may never happen.

If you are a known man,
then you are an ordinary man.

Dad, I do not care.

Your people would love you if you gave
your only daughter to one of them.

What a terrible idea.

You love this man today,
but how do you think you sensor

-after a life of poverty,
I give nothing.

I would still love him!

I offer you five times the value
of your catch and a fine fartoj-

-if you sv?rger-

-that you sail from here
and never see my daughter again.

With all due respect,
You know what my answer is.

Listen to me, Sinbad,
I am a fair man.

I offer you the opportunity
to get your desire fulfilled.

You can get married
with my daughter today.

But a minute after
that I have been man and wife...

-... you will be beheaded.
Daddy!

You have never been so barbaric!

How do you treat your daughter
and the man she loves, such ?!

Because I am the Sultan!

This man desires not only you,
Parisa.

He also determines
my whole kingdom fate.

You are no ordinary girl.

Your future would be
entwined forever.

If I lose you, I lose
an heir of royal blood.

So choose your fate, Sinbad!

-Is There something wrong with the food?
No, it's a beautiful sky.

Is there something wrong with me?

It is written that a man from the sea
must defeat all evil in this country.

Most men think
I'm irresistible.

But you may have other wishes?

Sinbad. Sinbad.

Firoozeh you live!

-It I think...
-We solve it. You come with me.

No, I have an idea. See.

-I Ask only wait with me.
-No! You follow me!

No, Sinbad.
This is the only way.

Poor Firoozeh.

So it seems to amuse you-

-when I show my sorcery power.

As you know, I
manipulate time.

See your child.

Your and Sinbads.

-How Do I know it's real?
-Because...

... The power of human emotions
generate tops...

... in time and space.

I have not knock
to change them.

Or...

... to catch these peaks and use
them to travel through time.

I am not strong enough,
but soon it will change.

But my Sinbad still alive.

I wonder
if you still feel that way...

... after we have looked at
your own destiny.

It was sin.

I see that you do not have any.

-Sinbad?
-Firoozeh You live?

-A Escaped soul?
-I Know who you are.

Then you know that you can not
play with me. Stand on the line!

Are you living still?
Forget it. Just go to the page.

Wait a minute. These are good people.
Why are they not in paradise?

Their fates are not decided yet.

But in the case
they have not earned it here.

There is cursed
these creatures. Also your men.

We are condemned to wander
of sand dunes in perpetuity.

Forward march!

Wait!

-Are You interested in a bet?
-I Have never been wanting.

Soon you belong to me.
It makes you all the time.

But you have things to do, and yet
you are trapped here as their watchdog.

True, Sinbad.

Killing is a natural part
of the large sand

-over life and time.

A curse is also part of the world.

But taking a life on a
unnatural way and curse it-

-skaber a huge gap.

Suppose I rate it here.

If I find this
white deeve and kills him...

... so lets these souls
go free without any harm.

And if you lose?

If I lose, I take your place
and watching over them forever.

You will definitely lose.

But in any case
I win.

But mark you this, Sinbad-

-to be me
is to suffer most of all.

I have borne the weight of all losses
and all sorrow, since man came to.

You will do it without end.

If you drop.

Are you still willing to
to participate in this bet?

Yes.

Yes.

-What Are you?
-This Picture paints a thousand words.

-The You do not need.
You look like the Sultan.

You see, what you will see.
Only what your brain will see.

A spirit becomes a part of you,
when it is freed.

-A True spirit.
Yes, to the service.

Is it true that the spirits grant
three wishes when they are freed.

It is said,
but for five hundred years ago-

-lokkede A treacherous and evil
human me to go into lampen-

-after he had gotten his wish.

As that was not bad enough,
he spent his final desired

-to use my powers
to a felling

-for the unfortunate soul,
which freed me.

He said that my deliverer
also could get three onsker-

-but then he added
a terrible condition.

The man must die within the first
sunset after my release.

So what have you got to say now, Sinbad?

So I will not
ask anyone wants.

I can not let you go
without your three wishes, you know.

One of them can not be
to spare your life.

I'm not looking forward to this.
When the day dawns, ending your life.

Just to be sure...

Not a single request can
spare me this despair?

Correct. A desire can not save you.
It makes me very sore.

But the spirit must obey his liberator.
So w ant now, Sinbad.

My first wish is that you
spares me for this despair.

I thought I
had explained it to you.

One of your wishes
can not spare you. What a waste!

Now there are only two wishes left.

My second wish is
to be close to Parisa.

See the power that you testify.

See the power that you testify.

-And Parisa?
Yes, behind these doors.

I can only take you
to deeves cave.

But what role does it play?
You must nonetheless soon say goodbye.

Yes, of course.
My third and last wish is...

... that you spare me
of this despair.

You must now observe the consequences of...

Excuse me a moment.
It's a bit confusing.

It takes just a moment, Sinbad.
Thank you.

Three wishes for five hundred years.
Minus one, minus one...

It might not be the entire desired.
One moment, Sinbad.

You need not be so confused.
A claim could not spare me.

-Continue...
-You Did not say that more people want...

... could not save me
from certain destruction.

Do struggling contend
if you do not have the right!

Your will is my law.

Thank you, Sinbad. You have freed me
from another prison.

My time here is almost over,
but before I say goodbye...

barging, undesired you do it here?
-No.

But there is no book,
which says that gifts are bad.

What should I...

The white deeve was a powerful force. 

armies could not escape
its grip. 

I want kill you again.

Yes, yes, yes... Sinbad...

You seem to
to have more lives than a cat.

Where is Parisa?

Before chipper
you should look around.

I can free the beast
with a single motion.

-Sinbad, Is it really you?
-Everything Is good.

-Befri Her!
You're not in a position to make demands.

What do you want?
-It's Not what I want...

... but what will happen.

A long time ago, I asked a spirit
grant my desired

-about unlimited power,
but the spirit tricked me.

My power is limited to this island.

However, this is changing.

A new day dawns and leads a storm with
itself, which spans the entire world.

A powerful soul as your
generates feelings for your elskede-

-and becomes the catalyst
which makes my magic thousandfold stronger!

Do you understand it, Sinbad?

You're the last
ingredient in this drink.

Was Parisa the bait
that led me here?

You threatened the woman I love.
My crew is gone.

Firoozeh which was as a sister death.

I know you see me
as embodied evil.

Or am I part of the balance sheet
as nature intended.

-It's Not too late to stop this.
-Make!

You only have one chance now.

Give me your soul,
otherwise I get rid of this beast freedoms

-which completes your life here and now.

-It Accepts me.
-No!

-What Will happen to him?
-He Can go with me...

... or be my humble servant.

It's his choice.

I have two conditions.
Parisa go free now.

And the city Malek must have peace.

Only then I promise you my soul,
and maybe I go with you.

You have my word.

Let's get it over with.

Take this and wear it around your neck.

And put your sword.

Why are you hesitating? Choose now.

Wealth, a ship and your life.

Or... one kn?lers wedding.

-The Choice is easy, your Majesty.
-Kraften!

I might as well be dead
like living an empty life without her.

I do not get wiped out!

There was another woman
in your life that you loved.

Your mother!

Hurry to the balloon!

Again evil
unable to defeat it - 

-a always been
the true ultimate power. 

Power in a motivated heart.
