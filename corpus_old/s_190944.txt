Miss Stoops?

Uh . . .five?

Do you know how many times
we've given you

substance.abuse treatment
in the state hospitaI

instead of jaiI?

Uh . . .three?

Uh , no, no.
Five, five.

Six .. six times.

The record aIso shows
that over the years,

the state has stripped you
of four chiIdren ,

decIaring you , in aII cases,
an unfit mother.

Unh.unh , unh.unh .

I was onIy unfit
for, uh , two of 'em .

First one got adopted ,
and I think the second one ..

Shut up. TeII me something ,
Miss Stoops.

Did you know you were pregnant
at the time of your arrest?

I don't know.

What do you mean
you don't know?

[ Sighs deepIy ]

Is there any way. . .
you can begin to understand

the depth
of your irresponsibiIity

toward your chiIdren ,
toward the state,

not to mention
toward yourseIf?!

You sicken me.

I'm sorry.

So.o.rry.

Sorry.

You pIeaded guiIty. . .again

Mr. Barnhardt here,

wants to fiIe

And I'm going to aIIow it,

charging you with

of your fetus.

Uh , uh , uh , uh ..

Now, I'm not sure

if I'm setting a precedent
here,

but you've forced me into it.

I'm going to recommend
you be bound over

Come here, Ruth .

[ InhaIes, exhaIes deepIy ]

Look, Ruth . . .

You and I both know you didn't

So why don't you just do us
aII a favor and go. . .

take care of this probIem?

Do you understand
what I'm taIking about?

TaIking about me

Is that what you want?

What I'm saying is,

if you think

go to the doctor

you can go.

Uh , you do Iike steak,

Mommy, do we stiII have

I'm reaIIy hungry.

Yes, young man .
She's our guest.

GaiI , this meat is done.

I'm trying to keep it warm ,

but you're gonna be eatin'
shoe Ieather here.

[ AirpIane engine roars ]

Been in there
over an hour.

An hour and a haIf,
for cryin' out Ioud .

This is probabIy the first warm ,
cozy pIace she's been in .

.. GaiI !
.. She's been out on the street.

I mean , my God .

You have got to be carefuI with
the peopIe you drag in here.

You don't know anything
about this woman .

You don't know
where she's been .

You don't know what kind
of Iife she Ieads.

.. It takes a Iong time ..
.. Think of Matthew for once!

Think how Iong it takes me
to get ready.

I mean ,
she's just getting cIeaned .

Mom , can I at Ieast have
a IittIe snack?

That does it.

[ Sighs ]

Is everything aII right

Dinner's ready.

Aren't you gonna weIcome

Hi , Mom .

Honey, you're just

Grab a pIate.

I'm not hungry.

WeII , we have a guest,

and we'd Iike you
to join us for dinner.

CheryI , get out here.

Honey, I'd Iike
for you to meet Ruth Stoops.

She's going to be staying
with us for a whiIe.

You pregnant?

How'd you know that?

Ruth , um . . .

wiII you join us in grace?

Everyone, arms up to Jesus.

Lord , we thank you

for reuniting our famiIy
around this tabIe,

and for the miracIe
of meeting Ruth .

.. [ Dog howIs ]
.. Amen .

We recognize
that it was your divine hand

that brought us aII together.

Oh , yes, Lord .

Ruth is in a very troubIed time
in her Iife right now.

And we know that through us,

you can show her
the right path .

As with open minds
and open hearts,

we can aII share and Iearn
from one another's experience.

So, I go, ''RauI , I hate you !
I hate you , man !

''I hate you ! I trusted you ,
and you Iet me down !

You Iet me down , man ,
just Iike aII the others!''

Ruth , Ruth , Iet's ..
Iet's caIm down , okay?

He freaks out.

He screams,
''You want to see bIood?''

Right in my face, ''I'II show
you bIood , you fucking bitch !''

.. Ruth .
.. Ruth .

Ruth .

And this is my modeI pIane.

It's my first modeI .

And those
are aII my other modeIs.

This is Noah's ark,
and you can kind of put,

Iike, that Iion and Noah
and the monkey on the roof

and the giraffe.

And then ,
this is what I Iike to do ..

you pick them up,
and you go ..

Oh , Ruth , there you are.

Matthew .. bedtime.

Say good night
to our houseguest.

.. Good night.
.. Night.

He's my IittIe miracIe.

You know, after I gave birth
to CheryI , I aImost died .

The doctor toId me I couIdn't
have any more chiIdren .

Oh , then God gave me
Matthew.

Wow.
Can I watch TV, or. . .

We don't have a TV.

NORM: Ruth , I want you to get
a good night's sIeep, now.

NORM: Ruth , I want you to get
a good night's sIeep, now.

Tomorrow, you can teII me
aII about your case.

We're gonna heIp you
fight this one.

GaiI and I feeI

very, very strongIy
about this.

Yeah , I never had
a feIony before.

I don't want to go
back to jaiI again ,

at Ieast not for more
than a week or two.

Don't you worry.

We've deaIt with
this Judge Richter before,

but this time,
he's gone too far.

When I think about
what he said to you ..

GAIL: Norm , honey, you're not
boring Ruth to tears, are you?

She's dead on her feet!

No, no.

We're just getting to know
each other.

I'm gonna bring it home,

want to miss our appointment.

Anybody got a cigarette?

No, there's no smoking
in this house.

Here are your eggs ..

hot, hot, hot.

Uh . Uh .

Now, you eat up.

And I'II just run
and put my face on .

Mmm .

Say, Ruth . . .
[ CIears throat ]

I got a caII
earIy this morning

from a, uh , a reporter

down at
the ''JournaI American .''

It seems Iike
that case of yours

might, uh , turn out to be
pretty important around here.

He wanted to chat with you ,
of course,

but. . .I toId him
that you were resting ,

and that
we weren't quite prepared

to make a statement
at this time, anyway.

Is that okay with you?

Ruth?

Good .
[ CIicks tongue ]

Now, I want you . . .
to have a wonderfuI day.

[ Sighs ]

You know, I don't feeI good .
I don't want to do this.

Oh , Ruth ,
I know it's scary,

but you have to be brave.

You're in the best
of hands here.

Now, before you know it,

you'II just be
right as rain .

Come on .

CongratuIations.

Your test confirms that you ,
in fact, have a baby on the way.

How about that?

[ ChuckIing ]

WeII , I need to find out
about getting an abortion .

WeII , that's ..

I think you're just
very upset right now,

and you don't understand
aII the facts.

I want you to taIk to me
about whatever is troubIing you .

I mean ,
that's what I'm here for ..

I'm here to Iisten .

Okay.

Like I said ,
I need to get an abortion .

Let me just ask you
something , Ruth .

Have you ever
reaIIy taken the time

to think about what it means
to have an abortion?

Yeah .

Um , it means that
I don't have to go to jaiI ,

and it means I don't have
to have another baby,

and it means that I can start
getting my Iife together.

I , I , I , I , I ..

Don't you think that's aII
just a IittIe seIfish?

Isn't there someone eIse here
you need to consider,

someone who's Iiving
inside you right now,

just waiting to be born?

I think this wouId be
a good time

to have Dr. RoIIins step in
and just expIain

some of the medicaI facts
to you , hmm?

CharIie. . .

Huh? What?
Oh , what? Oh !

[ ChuckIes ] Yes, yes.

Dr. RoIIins,
this is Ruth Stoops.

She's about
8 weeks pregnant.

And she wants to know
more about her chiId .

Oh , fine, fine.
[ ChuckIing ]

Ruth . . .

Yes.

Here, Iet me show you
something .

Ruth , your baby is aIready

weII into its journey
in Iife.

At 1 0 weeks, the baby
is just about this size.

The head and the feet and
the hands are aII fuIIy formed .

Your baby has a heartbeat.

And you know something ,
Ruth?

Some studies have even
shown brain activity.

Now, isn't that remarkabIe,

that even
at such an earIy stage,

your baby is made
in God's image?

Here.

I want you to hoId it.

Yes.

[ Tapping ]

Wow. It's got a IittIe thing .
[ ChuckIing ]

WeII , of course it does.

That's because
it's a IittIe boy baby.

Now,
when you have your baby,

what wouId you Iike to have?

WouId you Iike to have
a IittIe boy or a IittIe girI?

What do you ..
What do you mean?

WeII ,
we're just taIking here.

Let's say you decided
to have the chiId .

Uh , wouId you Iike it to be
a IittIe boy Iike this one?

Maybe a girI .

A girI .
[ ChuckIing ]

Yes, and what are we gonna
name this IittIe pumpkin?

Are we gonna caII it,
uh , uh , Mary or ..

or SaIIy
or Susie or, uh . . .

Tanya.

Tanya!

.. Baby Tanya.
.. [ ChuckIing ]

But I can't have
a baby right now.

I don't want another baby.

[ Sighs ]
Man , you don't understand .

I'm in a reaIIy bad ,
bad situation right now ..

I mean bad .

We know it's hard , Ruth ,
very hard .

But you have to face
reaIity.

If you feeI as though
you can't raise Tanya,

we can put you onto
an exceIIent adoption agency.

What's the matter?!
Are you fuckin' peopIe deaf?!

I said I want an abortion !

Ruth , uh , do you Iike
to go to the movies?

We have a movie
we'd Iike to show you .

Do you want to see
the movie?

.. [ Choir vocaIizes ]
.. Abortion is murder.

These scenes
of actuaI aborted fetuses

stand as grim testament
to the American HoIocaust.

Like Auschwitz and Dachau ,

the abortion miIIs of America
wage genocide against the ..

[ Door opens ]

Oh , how'd it go?

We had a good taIk,
sorted everything out,

and I think everything's
gonna be fine.

Just fine. Right, Ruth?

[ ChuckIing ]

I sIept in some dumpsters.

Maybe I sIept
on some babies.

Looks Iike we need
a IittIe cheering up.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Bingo.

Here you go.

Now, if you have
any troubIe with these,

you bring them right back.

Norm . . .

Mmm .

Look who's here.

WeII , weII . Visiting me
down in the saIt mines, eh?

[ ChuckIes ] Hey, you know what?
I'm gIad you came.

I've got something
I want to show Ruth .

Ohh .

Oh , shit!
I hate that picture!

Oh , now,
it's a fine picture.

Why do they care about me?
I didn't do nothin' !

Now, Ruth , I'm afraid ,
whether you Iike it or not,

this articIe
is just the beginning .

A Iot more reporters
have been caIIing ,

even from the TV stations.

Some are so antsy,
that one of them tracked me down

right here to the store.

Now, pretty soon ,
we're gonna have to decide

what to teII them .

WeII , teII them ..
I don't know what to teII them .

Norm . . .

are these your fIiers?

Oh , did I Ieave those

How about that?

JUDGE RICHTER: Is there any way

the depth

DR. ROLLINS :
Your baby is aIready

Don't do it!

Don't kiII your baby!

Now get back.
You know the routine.

Get back!

[ Voice breaking ] I know
exactIy how these girIs feeI .

Years ago,

I had an abortion
in this pIace.

It destroyed me.

[ Crying ] I think
about my dead baby aII the time.

If these women knew
what they were doing ,

they wouIdn't do it.

No, it's just
a business to them .

400 or 500 bucks a pop.
It's Iike contract kiIIing .

Ruth Stoops. Hi , I'm
Cindy Lindstrom , Action News 4.

You're a hard person
to get ahoId of.

I have a coupIe of questions
about your case.

No, I don't want peopIe
knowing my business.

Oh , no, no, no, no, no.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.

Ruth does not wish to speak
to the press right now.

This is a very personaI ,
very private matter

for Ruth and for us.

Excuse me, Norm , but I think
she can speak for herseIf.

Hey, I said I don't want
peopIe knowin' my business!

I toId you !

Fucker!

You see?
Now we got peopIe upset.

Ruth?

Honey,
what did she say to you?

Can we go now?

We got about an hour
and a haIf Ieft.

I don't feeI too good .
I got a reaIIy bad headache.

Oh . Why don't you sit down
somewhere?

I'II get you
something to drink.

My stomach hurts.
I wish I couId take a dump.

I'm reaIIy constipated .

Let's go, uh ,

Okay? WouId that

We're aII Iooking for you .

What are you doing?

You're not supposed

[ Coughing ]

Matthew! Honey!
Are you okay?

I found her smeIIing

You hit him?

What is wrong with you?!

Where is this gIue?
Where is it?

Give me that!
Give it to me!

Give it to me!

[ Squirting ]

In the name of God ,

I want you to get off drugs
right now! !

This is the deviI .
Do you hear me?

You have got the deviI

[ Crying ]
PIease don't hit me.

You are fuII of sin

We Iet you in our house!

We reach down
and Iift you out of that

fiIthy cesspooI you Iive in ,

and this is
how you repay us?!

[ Crying ]
I'm such a bad person .

We're aII sinners!

But that doesn't mean you
can go around smeIIing drugs,

especiaIIy when an innocent
baby suffers for it!

I do not want that woman
back in my house again .

W.What are we gonna do ..
put her out in the street?

Do you know how Iong
that wiII Iast?

I don't care.
Put her in a haIfway house.

She wouIdn't Iast 5 minutes
in a haIfway house!

Listen , you two,
aII this burden

doesn't have to faII
on your shouIders.

Let me take Ruth
for a whiIe.

Diane, no.

No, reaIIy.

You don't know what you're
getting yourseIf into.

I worked with substance abusers
back in Wyoming .

Maybe I can controI her.

I know.

Are you sure about this,
Diane?

Oh , yeah .
We'II be fine.

Okay, Ruth . Come on .

You're coming home
with me today.

[ BowIing pins cIanking ]

That's right.
Come on . Up.

Don't forget! Ruth has a
counseIing session tomorrow!

[ Tires screech ]

Hey! Hey, you !
Hey! Hey, you !

Uh , Ruth .

Ruth , I think there's someone
trying to say heIIo.

Yeah , you !

I'm gonna kiII your fuckin' ass,
you bitch !

Suck the shit out of my ass,
you fucker!

Hey, fuck you !

No, fuck you !

Fuck you ! Fuck you !

No! Go, go, go, go!

Go!

[ Tires screeching ,
horn honking ]

Oh , my.
Who was that?

I don't know.
Some guy.

[ Dog barking in distance ]

We're here.

Uh , Ruth . . .

this might be a IittIe
confusing at first,

but there's something
you need to know.

I'm not exactIy
who I appear to be.

The truth is. . .

I'm not a ''Baby Saver.''

I work for pro.choice.

You see, Ruth ,
there's a war on ,

and I guess you couId
caII me a spy.

This is RacheI .

She Iives here with me.

[ Gasps ]

Ruth !

Ruth .
Ruth , Ruth , Ruth .

Hey, hey, hey.

.. Come here.
.. Ow!

Ruth .

Ruth , Ruth .

.. Ruth .
.. It's okay.

Don't be afraid , Ruth .
It's okay.

You're safe now.

We're your friends.
We're on your side.

Ow! Ow!

Ohh ! Ohh ! Mngh !

Ow! Ow. Uh.uh .

FeeI that?

Uh , yeah .
That feeIs good .

That's your Iiver.

You have to reaIize they want to
use you to attack Judge Richter

for saying he'd Iet you out
for an abortion .

He's been ruIing against
the ''Baby Savers'' for years.

And now with aII the
pubIicity you're getting ,

they want to use you
to send a message.

If they keep you from getting
the abortion you want,

it'II be a big symboIic
victory for them .

Hey. . .
do my spIeen again .

But. . .thanks to Diane's work,

you're safe from them now.

It is aIways women Iike you

who are most victimized
by anti.choice ..

indigent women , third.worId
women , women of coIor.

I'm not a coIored woman .

Yesterday we reported the
tragic story of Ruth Stoops,

an indigent woman charged
with criminaIIy endangering

the Iife of her fetus
because of her drug use.

Members of an anti.abortion
group, the ''Baby Savers,''

have paid her baiI
and taken her in

whiIe she awaits hearing .

And today, they brought her
aIong to their daiIy protest.

Action News 4's Cindy Lindstrom
was there.

As anti.abortion protesting
continued today

outside the Women's
HeaIth Services CIinic,

Ruth Stoops showed up

aIongside ''Baby Savers'' IocaI
chairman Norm Stoney.

Stoops decIined to speak
with us on camera today,

but Stoney teIIs us she does
not pIan to have an abortion .

He thinks her unusuaI case
couId set a precedent.

We're amazed that the state
can seek to punish someone

for endangering
their preborn baby

and then aIIow them to kiII it
through abortion .

Now, we hope, and Ruth hopes,
that the absurdity of this case

wiII make crystaI cIear

the fundamentaI
unconstitutionaIity of abortion .

This simpIe woman ,
this quiet voice wiII send

a deafening message that
abortion must be stopped .

Oh , man ! I never said
anything Iike aII that.

He knew I didn't want anybody
knowing about me.

Stoney said Stoops' number.one
priority right now

is to get off drugs
and aIcohoI .

What's the occasion?

Cut the horse manure,
HarIan , you Nazi ,

and turn out that Iight.

Where is Diane?

She's sIeeping . Why?

She is not. Diane!

Now, I'm gonna have to ask you

You're gonna wake

Ruth ! Honey, we're here!
Are you aII right?

Ruth ! Ruth !

Hey, come on , kids. I don't want

That's very impressive,
Norman .

[ Car doors sIamming ]

Evening , HarIan .
FoIks.

Officers, they're hoIding a
woman captive inside this house.

Is that true, HarIan?

She's in there, Jim .
She's no captive.

You want to have her come out,
HarIan?

Diane, you want to go ahead
and bring Ruth out?

Diane?

Surprise.

What kind of person are you?

AII this time we've been
Iike sisters.

Sisters?

You don't know what it means
to be a sister.

[ AII groaning ]

PeopIe, Iet's get to the point
so we can aII go home.

[ Woman speaking indistinctIy
over poIice radio ]

Ruth , have these peopIe
kidnapped you?

No.

Are you here
against your wiII?

No.

They've brainwashed her!
They've got her aII doped up!

Ma'am . . .
I know this woman .

She's about as sober
as I've ever seen her.

[ CIears throat ]
Officer, the point is

that woman beIongs with us.

We're responsibIe for her.
We paid her baiI .

Yeah . A.And I bought her
those shoes.

WeII , it Iooks to me Iike you're
just responsibIe for her baiI .

Okay, foIks,
Iet's aII just go home.

There's nothing going
on here.

Ruth . Ruth , pIease. Honey,
pIease come back home, okay?

I forgive you
for this afternoon

and for everything that you
said to me on the phone.

PIease! Your bed is waiting
for you .

And Matthew misses you .

We share a speciaI bond .
We're Iike a famiIy, remember?

Don't Iet these ..
these Iunatics sway you .

For the Iove of God ,
don't beIieve their Iies.

Look at Diane.
Look how she Iied to us.

Had us compIeteIy fooIed .
She's Iying to you , too.

She's Iying !

So what's it gonna be,
Ruth?

Uh . . .

I'm gonna. . .

stay here.

[ ExhaIes sharpIy ]

And I'm gonna have that abortion
Iike I wanted .

'Cause I'm a citizen

and I got my rights
to, um , pick

and y.you're just trying to ..

And , um , I'm a woman . . .

Right?

Right.

Good work.

Thursday

We'II make

WeII , does it cost
a Iot of money,

'cause I.I don't got
any money.

[ Snapping ]

Don't worry, Ruth .

I'm sure we can find a way
to take care of it.

How wouId that be?

Whatever.

[ Snapping ]

[ Sighs deepIy ]

Oh , my God !

Come here.
You got to see this.

This is the bathroom ..

By the way, you're weIcome

Oh , that's pretty.

Hey, HarIan .

Good morning , Ruth .

[ Tape ripping ]

Whatcha doin'?

Just a IittIe insurance.
You never know.

Hey, who are those?

Uh , they're just some friends
of mine that wanted to heIp out.

I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay away from those windows.

Look, kid , why don't you
just go in the kitchen

and get yourseIf
a cup of coffee, huh?

[ Tape ripping ]

Man .

.. Good morning , Ruth .
.. Morning !

.. Did you sIeep okay?

Oh , we're just making

Uh , Iet me introduce you

Peter. . .

Hi , Ruth .

Briana. . .

.. Hey.
.. And Fran .

Hi . Remember us?

From the window
the other day.

.. Tryin' to get you out.
.. Got it.

Shit!

Fuck!

The ''Baby Savers'' are decIaring
a nationaI aIert.

A nationaI aIert?!

And Jessica Weiss herseIf
might decIare a counter aIert

and fIy in personaIIy.

Jessica Weiss here?
She's coming here?

What?

What? What?

I thought you said
everything's okay.

It is.
Everything is okay.

It's .. It's just
a IittIe different now.

This might be hard
to understand ,

but you're at the center
of something reaIIy big now.

It's not just about you
anymore.

It's more about the choice
of miIIions of American women .

Oh ! What'd I do now?!

Nothing . Nothing .
You didn't do anything .

Don't worry. We're gonna make
sure you have your appointment

without any interference.

There may be
a few more peopIe around ,

and they may be yeIIing
some ugIy things,

but don't Iet that bother you .

Ruth , we Iove you !
Don't kiII the baby!

Ruth , don't do it!

Save the baby!

[ Indistinct shouting ]

Ruth !

Save the baby, Ruth !

Save the baby!

Ruth ! PIease, Ruth !

Ruth , pIease!

Save Tanya! Ruth !

Don't kiII Tanya!

Listen , pIease don't kiII
the baby!

Get her away
from those windows!

He's gonna try to kiII me!
I gotta get out of here!

We're not gonna Iet anything
happen to you .

The safest pIace for you right
now is right here in this house.

HarIan has everything
under controI .

Don't kiII the baby!
PIease!

Ruth ! Save the baby!

You can't show weakness now.
You've got to prove to them

that you're not gonna give
in to their pressure.

[ TeIephone rings ]

We're gonna have to get her
a speciaI appointment tomorrow.

Okay.
Let's get a caII in to Sarah .

It's ABC News. They want
an interview with Ruth .

Ruth is not giving
any interviews!

This is a private matter!

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Whoo! We're here!

We're here!

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Frank, you oId son of a gun .

I haven't seen you
since BuffaIo.

We took the kids to FIorida,

and then we stopped
in Virginia

to see the tomb
of the unborn baby.

Yeah , this is unit 2 7.

We're stiII
the onIy ones on scene.

We're gonna need
some additionaI units out here.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Then there was that time
in Wichita.

We were making the gridIock,
you know.

And LIoyd had to take a piss
so bad ,

he started turnin' bIue.

[ Laughter ]

[ Indistinct conversations ]

[ Horn honking ]

That's aII right. I've got an
extra battery pack right here.

Right now there's sign painting
in the Garden Room .

The press conference
is in the Heritage Room .

.. What?
.. Oh , here comes Norm now.

Hey, Norm , you sure got
a big one on your hands.

AII in a day's work.
Just doin' what the Lord asks.

God bIess you , Norm .

So, we support Ruth , but we
oppose the pro.abortion forces

that are seeking to use her
as a symboI by coercing her

into doing something that she
cIearIy doesn't want to do ..

butcher her unborn baby.

[ AppIause ]

Uh , excuse me, Norm ,

but recent nationaI aIerts
by the ''Baby Savers''

have not drawn anything
Iike the numbers they used to.

Now, we know you had
a big disappointment in Akron .

ReaIisticaIIy, how many peopIe
do you think wiII show up here?

There has been
a tremendous outpouring

of Christian Iove and support.

So much so that concerned peopIe
from aII across this nation ,

incIuding BIaine Gibbons,
our nationaI chairman ,

are committed to Ruth .

So we're .. we're expecting
many, many peopIe.

Thousands. . .
in the next few days.

[ CIears throat ]

But we have something eIse
very exciting to announce.

But we have something eIse
very exciting to announce.

And for that, I'm going to turn
the microphone over

to Dr. CharIie RoIIins,

the director of our Tendercare
Pregnancy Center.

[ AppIause ]

[ ChuckIing ]

Thank you , Norm .

[ CIears throat ]

WeII , I am very proud to be abIe
to say that an anonymous donor

hearing of Ruth Stoops' pIight
was moved to reach out

in a very speciaI way.

I am hoIding here a check

for $ 1 5,000 made out
in the name of Ruth Stoops

to be presented to her
upon the birth of her chiId .

$ 1 5,000!

The ''Baby Savers'' aIso said
three different coupIes

have voIunteered
to adopt Ruth Stoops' baby.

MeanwhiIe, anti.abortion
protestors continue to arrive

outside this house
where Ruth Stoops is staying .

The house beIongs
to Diane ZeigIer,

an abortion.rights activist.

So the question
on everyone's mind is

''What wiII Ruth Stoops do?''

OnIy she knows, and for now,
she's not taIking .

Don Mattox, Eyewitness News.

What the heII do you think
you're doin'?

I'm rich ! Didn't you hear?

I gotta go taIk to Norm .
I gotta get that check.

No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

Ruth , Iisten to me.
Listen to me.

You've got to be very strong .

You've made your decision ,
and you've got to stick to it.

Wait.
It's my body, right?

It's my choice, right?
Can't I change my mind , huh?

Can't I?

Yes, of cour.. of course
you can change your mind .

That's what this is aII about.

Just make sure you're doing it
for the right reasons.

$ 1 5,000 might sound Iike
a Iot of money,

but there are more important
things to consider.

Like what?

Come on , Ruth .

Do you think you're ready
to have a chiId?

Hey, I have four other kids,
and I didn't make a cent.

Besides, they said they got
peopIe to adopt.

And can you stay off
drugs and aIcohoI

for the next 7 or 8 months?

Don't forget. You're facing
very serious charges.

You may be forced to spend
your entire pregnancy in jaiI .

Maybe Ionger.

I can give up drugs if I want.

God damn it!

How come every time
I want to do something

somebody tries to keep me
from doing it?!

Why can't I ever do
what I want?!

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Somebody's shouting .

Wa.a.a.nt!

[ Panting ]

[ Crying ]

It's okay.

[ Crying ] How can I turn down
so much money?

.. Shh .
.. I can't.

AII my Iife
I never had a chance.

If I had money,

my Iife wouId be different.

I wouId have been
such a good mother.

I have nothing to Iive for.

That's not true.

And , Ruth , don't forget.

If you reject
the ''Baby Savers''' offer,

you'II send a strong message

that a woman's choice
can't be bought.

[ SniffIes ]

Send a message?

[ SniffIing ]

What?

What did I say?

You want me to send
a message?

No. No.
Wait a minute, Ruth .

HoId on ! Ho.o.o.Id on !
HoId on , Iady!

You don't want me
to change my mind

'cause it's reaI important
to you !

But what about me?!

I don't got anything !

You aII got everything !

What are you gonna do
for me, huh?!

Are you gonna give me
$ 1 5,000?!

Sure.

I'II give you $ 1 5,000.

You wiII?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
HoId on here.

.. Yep.
.. HarIan !

You're not fuckin'
with me, man , are you?

'Cause if you're
fuckin' with me ..

I never fuck with anyone.

Look, I got
my Agent Orange settIement.

And if I can IeveI the pIaying
fieId for you , I wiII .

I won't Iet their fascist money
be a factor in your decision .

So I'm gonna give you
$ 1 5,000, Ruth ,

and you can do
whatever it is you want to do.

Stop this, both of you ,
right now.

Does that mean if I have
the baby, I couId have $30,000?

Okay.
Wait .. Wait a minute.

Now, Iet me rephrase this.

$ 1 5,000 from them
if you have the kid ,

and $ 1 5,000 from me
if you don't.

Now you can choose freeIy
again .

HarIan !
You can't do this!

I just did .

[ Cheers and appIause ]

BIaine. . .here.
Let me heIp you .

BIaine. . .

I can't teII you
how much it means to me

that you decIared the aIert
and came so quickIy.

No, Norman .
I'm gratefuI to you .

When you toId me
what was going on over here,

I was outraged .

More outraged than I've been
in a Iong time.

And there's a Iot of things
in this country that outrage me.

HeIIo, GaiI !

Oh , God bIess you , BIaine.

[ ChuckIing ]

Come on .
The car's over here.

If this gets out, it'II do
irreparabIe damage to us.

You know
how it'II be perceived?

Like we're paying her
to have an abortion .

The ''Baby Savers''
wiII have a fieId day.

Look, girIs, this has got
nothing to do with anybody

except Ruth and me.

You know, I've been providing
security at the cIinic

for a Iong time,
free of charge,

because I beIieve
in personaI freedom .

And because I beIieve
in personaI freedom ,

I'm gonna do what I want.

I'm acting
as an individuaI here.

Okay. So you're promising
that Women's HeaIth Services

and pro.choice have absoIuteIy
nothing to do with this?

Because we'II deny we ever ..

Don't get your panties
in a wad , okay?

Who do you think
you're deaIing with here?

I was in the SpeciaI Forces!

That's why the FHA
makes home ownership possibIe

for Iow.income peopIe
in the first pIace.

Take out a penciI and paper.

Good . Now, make a coIumn
down the Ieft.hand side

Iisting aII your assets.

Ruth !

Ruth !

We need to taIk to you .

Hey, do you have
a pen and paper?

'Cause I need a pen
and paper.

Yeah . CouId you step in here
for a minute, pIease?

I need a pen and paper.

The thing is, Ruth ,

about this, uh , deaI
between you and HarIan . . .

you know,
w.we've been taIking , and , um ,

w.we just want to make sure
that you understand .

They don't want you to teII
anybody where you got the money.

.. Okay.
.. This is very important.

You can't teII anyone ever.

.. Because if you do ..
.. I won't.

Thank you , Ruth .

We reaIIy appreciate it.

Now can I have
that pen and paper?

[ ToiIet fIushes ]

[ ToiIet fIushes ]

[ Hangers cIattering ]

Eric?

You want to get me
some ice?

Sure, BIaine.

You're a great kid .

Did I ever teII you
about Eric?

Yeah .

His mother was standing

on the steps
of the abortuary

about to go in
and kiII her baby.

[ CIicks tongue ]

And she heard a Christian voice,
and that voice said ,

''You don't have to go
in there.

''God Ioves you .

God Ioves your baby.''

So she stopped , with tears
in her eyes, and she said ,

''I'm an unmarried woman .

''I cannot afford the expenses
of having a chiId .

''No one cared enough

''to give me the strength
to accept this baby.

No one but this one
Christian man .''

And that Christian man . . .
was me.

Ha ha ha!

Years Iater, at a raIIy,

I saw the young Iady again .

And I said to her,

''What's
this young man's name?''

And she said ,
''This is Eric.''

And that was the proudest day
of my Iife.

[ Indistinct conversations,
horn honking ]

Hey, HarIan .

Hey.

[ CIattering ]

Thanks for that money.

No probIem .

[ SIurping ]

Are you married , HarIan?

No, but I got a coupIe
of ex's on the payroII .

[ SIurping ]

You got a girIfriend?

What?

Are you comin' on to me?

Because if you're coming
on to me,

you can just forget it.

I'm not comin' on to you .

I just wanted
to thank you .

WeII , I don't need
your gratitude, okay?

As a matter of fact,
I hate gratitude.

Fine.

TeII me somethin' , Ruth .

What are you gonna do
with aII that money?

I know a way to get a house.

.. A house?
.. Mm.hmm .

With the rest of the money,
I'm gonna buy a car.

And , uh . . .set myseIf up
in a business.

Or go to CaIifornia.

I never saw the ocean .

Ruth , I don't want to burst
your bubbIe,

but you and I both know
that money'd be gone

in three days tops.

Fuck you , man !
You don't know anything !

[ ChuckIing ]

What's the matter, Ruth?

Can't you take
a IittIe tough Iove?

Fuck you , Ioser.

Why don't you teII me
about this. . .$ 1 5,000?

We just thought ..
weII , you know

how the pro.abortionists
are aIways accusing us

of onIy caring about the baby
whiIe it's in the womb?

Mm.hmm . Go on .

WeII ,
we wanted to show them

that we're committed
to the chiId after birth , too.

Ruth , uh , weII , you know,
she can bareIy support herseIf,

Iet aIone a baby.

And we didn't want money
to be a factor in her decision .

WeII , what a nice thought.

[ ChuckIing ]

Of course,
it wouId have been better

had you passed it
by me first.

That's enough .

Have you got any idea
how far $ 1 5,000 goes today?

Our fax biIIs just for a month
are over $2 ,000.

Has it ever crossed
your mind ,

have you ever thought
about the fact .. thank you ..

that maybe some peopIe
might think

this is some cheap attempt
to buy this girI ..

that we are trying
to bribe her?!

A few of us pIedged
aII that we couId

to raise that $ 1 5,000.

And we aII agreed not to have
the picnic this year.

We might seem Iike smaII.town ,
unsophisticated peopIe to you ,

but we've got our pride.

I know.

Maybe I am
a IittIe too passionate,

but that's who I am .

That's why I founded
this ministry.

That's why I Iead
this ministry.

I Iead it with every pore
and every fiber

and every muscIe
in my being .

And if we reaIIy want to
demonstrate our compassion

and our commitment
to saving Iives. . .

then maybe we shouId offer
this girI at Ieast $30,000.

MAN : Government forecIosures,
bank forecIosures,

Abortion is murder!

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Yeah?

I'm CaroI Stoops.

I'm , uh , here to taIk
to my sister Ruth .

Sorry, Iady.
Can't do it.

But Ruth's my sister.
Just teII her I'm here.

Just remember,
it's a chiId , not a toy!

And give her this note.
It'II prove to her who we are.

I'II see what I can do.

Now, move the vehicIe
off the property.

We'II park and come back.

WOMAN :
This is tape two, side one

of the Larry Jarvik system .

MAN : WeIcome back.

We've discussed the difference

between Iiquid assets,
frozen assets,

and what I Iike to caII
captive assets.

And by now, you've fiIIed in
the chart on page 1 1 3.

Keep the chart handy whiIe we
figure the capitaIization rate

on your investment.

You'II see how simpIe it is
to turn short.term paper

into Iong.term ,
interest.free income.

I'II waIk you
through one exampIe,

and you can go back and do
the caIcuIations again ,

substituting your own numbers.

Say you're buying a fourpIex

with an asking price
of $ 1 50,000,

and your net operating.income
figure is $9,000.

Divide the operating income
into the asking price

and what do you get?

That's right .. 6% .

Now, do your own caIcuIations,
and when we continue,

I'II finish taIking
about asset conversion .
