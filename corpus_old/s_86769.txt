There.

Technicals, nine o'clock.

Oh, shit! Did you see that?

Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

This food is the property
of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!

Go back to your homes!

<i>Command, Super 64...</i>

<i>...we got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.</i>

Request permission to engage.

<i>Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.</i>

<i>Negative, command.</i>

<i>U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.</i>

<i>- Return to base. Over.
Roger.</i>

<i>64 returning.</i>

Ready, Mr. Atto.

Leaving.

Sir.

Keep Driving!

I'm going to be late.

Call you back.

General Garrison?

No, thanks. I got one.

But these are Cuban.

Bolivar Belicoso.

So is this.

Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

Me?

But am I that important?

I hardly think so.

You're just a businessman.
Trying to make a living.

Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

You've been here, what?

Six weeks?

Six weeks
you are trying to catch the general.

You put up reward posters.

$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

It's the O.K. Corral.

Do you think bringing me in
will make him suddenly come to you?

Make him more agreeable?

You know where he sleeps.

You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

And we will find him.

Don't think because I grew up
without running water...

...I am simple, General.

I do know something about history.

See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

A tomorrow without a lot
of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.

This is civil war.

This is our war.

Not yours.

300,000 dead and counting.

That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

How'd he strike you?

Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

Yeah, he's a good catch.

It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

I'm not sure time is something we got
in great supply.

This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

They've been calling for situation reports
every morning this week.

Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.</i>

<i>I'll be your pilot today.</i>

Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program
will earn 100 free credits.

And as always, the air sickness bags
are in the seatback in front of you.

Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

<i>You're still clear.</i>

<i>61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.</i>

I've got some bad news.

"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

<i>It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.</i>

"Limo" is a word in common usage.

That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

<i>It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!</i>

<i>It does have to be in the dictionary!</i>

When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

<i>You touch my "limo"
and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.</i>

Yeah, promises.

That's a nice beach down there.

How's the water?

Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

Name.
Todd.

Last name.
Blackburn.

First name, Todd.

So, what's it like?
What's what like?

Mogadishu. The fighting.

Serial number.
72163427.

Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog".
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

Secondly, I wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

Why not?

Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

Typing.

Can you type?
No.

Date of birth.
2-27-75.

Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

<i>Let's bring it in.</i>

Nice, man! Very smooth!

Single shot through the engine block.

Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

Cease fire! Cease fire!

Check your weapons!

Sergeant Eversmann.

Private First Class Blackburn.

Yeah?

Reporting for duty.

Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be here somewhere.

Can I leave him with you?

Yeah, go ahead.

You brought your weapon.
Yes, sir.

Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

When did you get in?
Just now, Sergeant.

Hey, who's hungry?

What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

Not if General Garrison is asking.
I'm asking.

Have a nice meal, Captain.

Hey, man, there's a line.
I know.

Well, this isn't the back of it.
Yeah, I know.

Sergeant. Sergeant.

What's going on here?

Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

I'm talking about your weapon.

Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

Well, this is my safety, sir.

Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

You Delta boys
are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

Y'all better learn to be team players.

We're done here.

Speak up. You say this is your safety?

Well, this is my boot, son.

And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

Is that a Jersey accent?
I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

Take those sunglasses off.

Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

I don't want to see them on you again.

<i>Is that a hot weapon?</i>

Is that your move?

Is my hand on the piece?

I can mate you in three whatever you do.

I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

Well, she's just lying in wait.

Yikes.

It's good. You're really improving.

If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

Go ahead.

It's a children's book, right?
Right.

They are not supposed to scare
the living shit out of the children.

This is the part of the story
where our knight is slaying the dragon.

That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

Thought you finished that last week.

You done?

Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

You understand?

Can you count? One, two, ten.

Okay? Where are my running backs?

Where are my running backs?

Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

You had something more important to do?

Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

I will make you believe, you understand?

Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

All right, carry on.

I'd like a word, specialist.
Sir.

You understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

Roger that, sir.

If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

...till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

Are we clear?
Hoo-ah, sir.

All right.

Listen to this:

If one skinny kills another his clan owes
the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

A hundred camels.

Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

Is that really true, Lieutenant?

Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

See, what you guys fail to realize
is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

He believes in this mission
down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

Look, these people, they have no jobs...

...no food, no education, no future.

I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

We can help...

...or we can sit back and watch
the country destroy itself on CNN.

Right?

I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

Like the man said, he's an idealist.

Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

<i>Stay away from the cans!</i>

<i>Die, gas-pumper!</i>

<i>Stay away from those cans!</i>

No, no, stay back.

He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

You got a problem with that?
No, sir.

It's a big responsibility.

Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

Their lives depend on it.

All right.

Rangers lead the way, sir.
All the way.

Good luck.

<i>A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.</i>

I say "may" because we all know by now...

...with the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

Two tier-one personalities may be present:

Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

These are the guys we're after.

Today we go.

Same mission template as before.

1545, Assault Force Delta
will infiltrate the target building...

...and seize all suspects within.

Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

...will rope in at 1546...

...and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

No one gets in or out.

Extraction Force:

Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column
will drive in at 1547...

...on Hawlwadig Road
and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

Wait for the green light.

Now once Delta gives the word...

...McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

Immediately after
the prisoners are loaded...

...the four Ranger chalks
will collapse back to the target building...

...load up on humvees...

...and the entire ground force
will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

...but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

Too high-profile.

So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

Colonel Harrell.

In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

...and I will coordinate ground forces.

Colonel Matthews.

Mission launch code word is Irene.

Questions?

Which building is it, sir?

We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

I don't choose the time or place
of their meetings.

I didn't say a word, sir.

Make no mistake,
once you're in the Bakara market...

...you're in an entirely hostile district.

Don't underestimate their capabilities.

We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

...so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

Now, let's go get this thing done.

Good luck, gentlemen.

What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

...afternoon when they're all fucked up
on khat...

...only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice...

What's not to like?
Life's imperfect.

For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

What the fuck, Smith?

Well?
Well, what?

We going?

Why should I tell you that?
Because I'm me.

Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

Bakara market.
All right.

Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up
out there today, all right?

Keep sharp.

Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

Nothing.

It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

This, my friend, is a science.

You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

About "be all you can be".

I made coffee through Desert Storm.

I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

...got to be a Ranger.

Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

What happened to you?
Ping-Pong accident.

What?

So guess what.

Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

You're fucking me.

You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

Sergeant Eversmann said
to get your stuff and get ready.

It's what you wanted, isn't it?

Oh, yeah.

Hell, yeah.

Grimesy, stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it.

Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah.

I wouldn't worry about that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

Might even be fun.

D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

Chopper's going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

...but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

We're elite.

Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

Any questions?

We're going to be okay.

Grab your gear. Let's move out.

You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

You won't need that, either.

We'll be back before dark.

You might as well take dope
and beer instead.

What?

Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

You don't need another 12.

I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

Well, I better keep mine in.

Grimes.

Most important thing:

Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

That's bad luck.
No, it's smart.

All Delta do that.

That's bad luck too, man.

Come on, let's go.

It's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

If not, I don't know what you'd do.
You're a funny guy, man.

I'm not taking no death letter.
We have a deal.

I'll give it to you back in an hour.

Blackburn, you okay?
Excited.

In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

You ever shot at anybody before?

No, sir.

Me neither.

Think he's reliable?

Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
Yes, sir.

Tell him to turn his radio off.

Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

<i>Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.</i>

<i>Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?</i>

<i>Pick up if you're there.</i>

I'm just calling
to make sure everything's all right.

I'll call you in a couple hours.

You'd better not be sleeping.

Your move, Randy.

<i>I'm missing you.</i>

I love you, baby.

Hello? Hello?

Thanks, bud.

You know, it's kind of funny.

Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

Could almost be a good place to visit.

Almost.

You don't think we should be here.

You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

...just goes right out the window.

I just want to do it right today.

Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

<i>Abdi, come in.</i>

Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

<i>Abdi, come in.</i>

<i>Can you hear me? Abdi.</i>

<i>Abdi, come in. Is this the place?</i>

To my right side, above the cafe.

<i>He says this is the building.</i>

He's certain?

<i>Abdi, you need to be sure.</i>

Are you sure?

Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

But there's too many militia.

<i>If I go closer, they might shoot me.</i>

<i>Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...</i>

...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

I'll fucking shoot him myself.

Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

...and we wait until extraction of prisoners
is complete here.

Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

Home in an hour. Okay?

There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

Hoo-ah.

Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

<i>Sir, the vehicle is stopped.</i>

So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

<i>- He sounds scared shitless.
Good. That's always a good sign.</i>

<i>That's it. That's our signal.</i>

All right.

All QRF out of the airspace.

All QRF out of the airspace.

All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

<i>Check in when ready. Barber 51 up
and ready. Star 41 up and ready.</i>

Irene!

<i>Copy, Irene.</i>

Fucking Irene!

Come on.

Good luck, boys.

Be careful.

No one gets left behind.

What's wrong?

Nothing. He's just never done that before.

Aw, fuck!

Let's go.

Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

<i>Two minutes.</i>

Two minutes.

Why are they burning tires?

Signals to the militia that we're coming!

<i>Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies
on the ground.</i>

<i>Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.</i>

One minute.

One minute.

What's that for?

Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

<i>Touching base.</i>

<i>Two feet, one foot...</i>

<i>...clear.</i>

<i>Little Birds touching down at target.</i>

Ropes!

Go! Go! Go!

<i>Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.</i>

<i>This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.</i>

Down! Get down!

Down! Stay down!

Get down! Everybody down!

You, down!

Get down!

On the floor.

Let's go, let's go!

Grimesy! No fear!

Oh, yeah, right!

<i>Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.</i>

Colonel, they're shooting at us!

Colonel, they're shooting at us!

Well, shoot back!

<i>This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.</i>

<i>This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.</i>

<i>Super 62, take up an overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.</i>

<i>This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.</i>

Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

Go, Blackburn!

RPG!

Hold on!

No!

<i>C-2, we got a man fallen.</i>

<i>Super-61, you're a sitting duck.</i>

<i>Take up overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.</i>

<i>Roger that. 61 coming out.</i>

<i>13, go ahead. I need you to move to
the north of the street.</i>

<i>Right to the north. Right there. Over.</i>

Doc! Doc Schmid!

Come on!

Schmid, we got a man hit.

Where's he hit?
He's not. He fell.

What?
He fell.

Why aren't you shooting?

We're not being shot at yet!

How can you tell?

A hiss means it's close.

A snap means--

Now they're shooting at us!

Galentine!

Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

Blackburn, can you hear me?

Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

I can't get him!

Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

We need to get him out of here! Over.

This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

<i>We've got a man down! Over.</i>

Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

<i>- Man down!
Missed that, 25.</i>

<i>- Fuck it.
Say again.</i>

Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

What did he say?

<i>Super 61,
we got a man wounded on the ground.</i>

Stretcher!
Get me a stretcher!

Come on. Stretcher.

Come on, come on!

Grab this end!

Let's go!

All right.
Go.

Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.
