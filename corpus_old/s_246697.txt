Come on, baby. Alright?

Hurry up.

So impatient.

I'll stop being impatient
when you stop being on the clock.

Well then,

what's your pleasure?

The works.

Honey...

How about dinner?

How about it?

Would you buy me dinner?

Gimme, gimme, gimme.

That's all I ever hear
out of your mouth.

Forget it.

Alright, I'll buy you dinner.

Leave that ass of yours in here
alright?

I gotta get out of here.

What's your pleasure, Miss?

Jack and Coke for starters.

You're new here.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know I'd remember you.

You got a good head
for remembering people?

You got to in my line of work.

I'm meeting someone here.

Gordon Yeardly.
Gordo?

He came in here about an hour ago.

You're meeting him, huh?

I didn't figure you
for a working girl.

Honey, I'm always working.

Well, you're kind of late.

He's already went to the VIP suite
with Dusty.

I'm afraid you missed out.

We'll see about that.

Thanks, honey.

Hey. Count on it. Thank you.

How are the cards running?

I don't know. I just... got here.

I'm really bad at counting.
Maybe you can help me.

I can help you all you want.

Gordon, Mr. Halston wanted me
to give you these winnings.

That's a pretty big wad.

Cashing out and taking a long trip.

Really? And we just met.

There's always time for a pit stop.

I'm ready.

Beat it.

You promised me dinner.

I said scram!

Who's this?

Never you mind.

I'll see you when I get back.

Don't bet on it.

Heck of a guy.

What can I say?

Ladies love me,

but you'll find that out soon enough.

Hit me.

No problem.

Gordon Yeardly,
you're under arrest.

What are you, a cop?

Worse, a bounty hunter.

Hey, what's going on?

I've got this.

Sorry Miss,
you'll have to take this outside.

You know what,
this can go nice or nasty.

You decide.

Let's take a walk.

So, what do you think?

Interesting.

Very interesting.

So, are you going to
post bond for him?

Well he's kind of risky,
wouldn't you say?

I mean, he has skipped out
on the last two tickets he's had.

Yes, but he's got really
good reasons for both of them.

Yeah, there always is.

Well, he's the only brother I've got

and I promised my parents
that I would look out for him.

Well, if you need my advice,

I would say...
you're not doing such a good job.

Listen...

don't get upset.

You know, he's the only family
I've got left.

I'd hate to think of him
sitting in a jail.

Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.

I'll take a look at his rap sheet
and see what I come up with,

but I may have to call you
for further information.

That's alright.

I just want you to know something.

I'll do anything...

Anything at all.

Anything?

Anything to help my brother.

Knock, knock.

Jesus Christ!
I got a ticket to punch.

Can't it wait until tomorrow?

Spare me.

Look, I can see that you're busy.

Will you call me tonight?

I will definitely call you tonight.

Well, alright.

And don't you worry about a thing.

Laying it on a little thick
aren't you, Benny?

Hey, what goes on between
me and my potential clients

are none of your concern.

So they're potential clients, now?

Give me your ticket.

Gordon Yeardley,
a snatch that bedazzles.

Car pulled outside the city?

Trying to cash out and take off.

I knew it. I knew it.

Never doubt my instincts.

Speaking of instincts,

you ever think of
redecorating this place?

I mean it's a bit seventies.

You know I like things
just the way they are, J.C.

You up for another run?

Always.

That's what I like about you,

you're eager.

This is a special one.

Oh, let me guess.

Guy gets arrested, skips bail,
he takes off, I catch him.

What's the difference?

You ever hear of a guy named...

Franco Maretta?

Button man for the mob.

One and the same.
One and the same.

He got squeezed last week.

The D.A. Office got him.

He's going to testify
against the mob?

Smart guy.

Well, that was the plan,
but now, he's in the wind.

And you posted bail?

Stupid.

Hey. His money is just
as green as anybody elses.

You know,
I've never taken in a mob guy.

This could be pretty interesting.

Well, JC, I'm not taking any
chances with this guy.

Have I ever let you down?

No, but to cover my ass,
I'm bringing in help.

I work alone.

That's no fun.

Oh no. Not this jackass.

Now, is that any way to speak
of your coworker?

You totally screwed up
the Gonzalez case.

Try again.

It was you sneaking in through
the back that scared him off.

That was all mine.
I did all the legwork.

Hey. Knock it off, both of you.

Now, this guy needs to be brought in

and I want my best hunters
on this and that's you two.

Like or not, that's the deal.

I'm not working with him.

And I'm not crazy about
working with her.

Hey, I don't care how you do it.

Just bring him in.

Hey, I say it whole buddy.

The first person
who brings him in gets the loot.

May the best man win.
Screw you.

I'll be ready to go to court
in a week.

Listen, there's no deal.

Your client was found asleep

with the murder weapon
was under his pillow.

Tell me how that was circumstantial.

Fine. File a motion.
I'll see you in court.

Hello. J.C.

How's it going?

I sent the check. I mailed it today.

Did I say anything about a check?

It's been crazy here.
I mean...

I'm backed up with motions
two judges called in sick.

Don't take it out on me.

What do you want?

Christ, you're in a mood.

I'm sorry. How are you?
You look good.

Thanks, so do you.

You've been working out?

Whenever I can.

I haven't heard from you
in a couple of weeks.

How are you?

That's what happens
when you get divorced, Tom.

Now, who's in the mood?

That reminds me,

we were always quick
to get into a fight, weren't we?

Yeah. Makeup sex
was pretty damn good.

Yeah, it was.

I know I'm not supposed to
go there, but... I miss you.

I think you're lonely and desperate.

And you?

Never desperate.

Lonely?

Shut up and kiss me.

So Tom?

So JC?

I have to admit that there was
a reason I came here to see you

Besides screwing my brains
out on my desk?

That was a distraction.

What's up?

Franco Marreta.

Stay away.

Come on.

I mean it, JC.

The Colores family isn't a crowd
that you want to mess with.

From what I hear, he's traveling solo.

All the more reason.
That makes him more dangerous.

Give me a break.

JC, you always do this.

You dive into these situations
without thinking about it.

I know exactly what I'm doing
and I'm damn good at it.

You can either help me or not.

You make the call.

You're so damn stubborn.

Yeah, so?

If I help you,
I want to be in on the arrest.

I'm not splitting my bounty
with the cops.

Listen, if you get to him first
I'll make sure you get the credit.

I just don't want you
bringing him in alone.

You help me. I'll help you.

This guy's probably dead already.
I mean... they hate rats.

A rat you made.

Oh, spare me.

Here's a list of his...

known whereabouts
and previous acquaintances.

Promise me.

Promise me
that you'll keep me informed.

Admit it, I'm better at this
than the cops.

Promise.
I promise.

Hmmm.
What?

Oh, just some names that I recognize.

See ya.

See ya.

Hey, we don't want anymore trouble.

Oh good. Neither do I.

Do you have a hostess here
by the name of Dusty?

I'm not at liberty
to discuss our employees.

I thought
you didn't want any more trouble.

She's in the V.I. P room.

Alone?

On a break.

See, that wasn't hard, was it?

Dusty, got a minute.

A minute's going to cost you.

I'm not here for action.

I just want some answers.

You're that bounty hunter
that grabbed up Gordon.

Yeah.

Good for you.
I didn't like him much anyway.

Is that who you wanted to talk about?

No, actually. Franco Marreta.

Don't know him.

Really?

The district attorney's office
said that you did.

Well, that's their problem.

Seems he was a regular here.

Spent a lot of time in the V.I. P room
and you've never heard of him?

No.

Never played hostess for him?

Look, I'm with a lot of guys.
I can't keep track of them all.

I'm not here to hurt you.

I'm just here to find this
Franco guy and take him in.

I don't want any trouble
with him or his mob buddies.

Who said he was in the mob?

I might've heard things.

What things?

Nothing, ok?

Now, leave me alone,

prance your pretty little head
out of here,

because I don't have to answer
any of your questions.

Ok.

But if you hear nay more things
give me a call.

I'll make it worth your while.

I make this in ten minutes.

Good for you.

You're a smart girl, Dusty.

Maybe some day,

you'll be smart enough
to get out of this business.

Hello, Dusty.

Oh, a slumber party.

Oh, how tender.

Whoa.

Hello?

Whoa.

Move it and lose it.

Christ!

What the hell are you doing here.

The same thing you're doing here.

We're on the same assignment,
remember?

You're trying to follow me
to drop on Franco.

Hey, I don't share secrets
with my competition.

I should shoot you.

Meanwhile, you let me
grab your gun, sloppily.

Look, who's the one
with the prick up your nose?

I let you spin me.

Get your own lead.

No.

Have you ever worked
with your mouth wired shut?

Shit!

What happened?

Someone came in the back
and shot at us.

Call 911.

Come on.

Did you see who did it?

No, it happened too fast.

I'm out of here.
No one's going anywhere.

Cops and ambulance are on their way.

Ladies, put on a pot of cocoa.
It could be a long night.

What's going on?

A gunshot wound.

Victim was taken to first general.

Nothing serious. Just grazed her arm.

Meanwhile, we have two
hotshot bounty hunters

staking out the place.
A lot of good they did.

He didn't do anything.

What's with the get up costume?

Is the circus in town?

Actually, I was at dinner
with the mayor.

The last thing I want to do
is come here

and take care of this mess.

Well, maybe if your boys in blue
did their job a little better,

we wouldn't have to go running
all over town

chasing escaped felons.

You got a problem, pal?

You want to go? We can go.

Listen! Knock it off, alright.

Officer, may I speak with the witness?

Yes, sir.

Look, I'm not going to hang around
here all night while he plays cop.

I don't think we have a choice.

Listen, the longer we stay here
the longer Marreta has to get away.

Officer, can you take
this witness downtown

to make a statement?

I got to go to work.

After you make a statement.

You mind telling me what's going on?

What did she say?

I ask the questions here.

Look, earlier this evening,
I was talking to Dusty,

the working girl who got shot.

I thought that she knew
more than she was saying.

So, I thought I'd sit on her
and see what happened.

You didn't see the gunman?

I was distracted.

I see.

Don't get smug with me, Tom.

I thought you were going to
keep me informed.

Nothing happened.

You called that nothing?

That girl just identified
the shooter as Franco Marreti.

He was here?
That's right.

The guy half the police force
is looking for shows up

and tosses off a few rounds

a hundred feet
from where you're standing,

while you're watching.

Nice work, JC.

I can see
while you're the best at this.

Why didn't she say that before?

Why would she say anything to you two?

Do you have any more questions?

I just might.
Good, then put them down in writing.

Hey, don't let that stuffed
asshole back there get to you.

That stuffed asshole is my ex-husband

and he's got a good point.

If we were on the ball,
we could've gotten to Franco.

I hate to admit it.

So do I,
but I think we should team up.

Pool our resources.
Share the bounty.

Deal.
Deal.

I'll go convince Dusty
to stay away from him.

You take the front with Jasmine.

Good plan.

There's something about this story
that doesn't seem right to me.

Get going. I'm going to head off.

I don't know why I'm staying here.

I told you that it's not safe.

It's not fair, is what it is.

Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

I want to help.

Jasmine told me that
it was Franco who shot at you.

Well, I didn't exactly see who it was.

So, if Jasmine said it was Franco,
then that's that.

You've been with Franco
at Dazzle's haven't you?

Yeah, a bunch of times.

I was his favorite girl.

Now, we're getting somewhere.

I don't know why he would
do this to me, though.

Maybe you know something that he
doesn't want anyone else to know.

That's it, isn't it?

Stupid mobsters.

They think they're so cool
with their stories.

My god, they pay us by the hour
we don't even care what they do.

He told you things?

I don't even know you.

Look Dusty, I'm the only one
sticking my neck out for you.

Tomorrow morning, the cops
will be here and all over you

offering protection and then
there's nothing that I can do.

I can't take protection from the cops.

I can't even tell them what I know.

I can help you. Trust me.

I'm tired.

I know.

Let's get some of your things
and go to my place.

How are we doing tonight, gentleman.

It's about time you showed up.

Just holler if you need anything.

What's your hurry, darlin'?

I told you. I don't know anything.

Let me ask first.

Is there a problem?

No. Actually, we were just
getting acquainted.

Isn't that right, darlin'?

Let's take this off the floor.

Lead the way.

Look, I told you that I told the cops
everything that I know.

Will you relax?

Pour me one of those.

This is some setup
you girls have going on here.

Private club, nobody bothers you.

What? I guess you kick back
30 or 40% to the house?

Fifty.
Fifty? Man,

you do all the work
and they make all the money.

It's not like we have a union
or anything.

Let's talk about Franco.

Let's not.

Look, if you want to talk and drink,

we can do that downstairs, at the bar.

Once you pass through those doors,
you're on the clock.

It's all business with you.

Fine...

now I'm paying for your time,
so we can talk all I want.

What if I don't feel like talking?

Then I guess we'll sit here
and stare at each other for an hour.

What do you want from me?

I want you to trust me.

I'm sure that's all you want from me.

Look, you are sexy

and I would love
to hit the sheets with you.

Happy? But I'm working here.

Really?

Besides, I know about you and Dusty.

Just because me and Dusty hook up
doesn't mean that I don't like boys.

Boys or men?

Men.

What about being on the job?

Off the record.

So, is this going to be
business or pleasure?

I don't know.

I'll tell you later.

Fair enough.

Oh, yeah...

You do like that, don't you?

I like it harder.

Oh, yeah...

Oh, yeah...

Yes... yes!

Think you can trust me now?

I can.

Let's get out of here
and go somewhere where we can talk.

I get off in two hours.

Hello?

Where in the hell is my witness?

Asleep in my bed.

Listen, I need to talk to
this Dusty character.

I don't think she's going to talk to
you or anyone else in authority.

Let me guess.
She's opened up to you.

She's starting to.

She definitely knows something
but if you push too hard, she'll run.

I can't wait for her
to get over her jitters.

I can't have my star witness running
around shooting innocent citizens.

So noble.

JC!

Look, let me spend some time with her.

I really think that
she could lead me to Franco.

I don't know why
I give you so much leeway.

Because, deep down,
you know I can do the job.

I promise that I'll keep you informed.

Look, about earlier,
about the things I said,

I don't rally blame you.

I'm sorry.

It's ok.

You were right,

but I really appreciate your apology.

Ok, so then we're clear?

We're clear. You know something?

What?

This is the first conversation

we've had where we haven't ended up
in a fight or in bed.

Well, I got some time.

Good night, Tom.
Good night.

Dusty, oh my god. How are you?

What happened?

I'm ok.

Oh, my God!

What's the story?

They didn't want to talk
until they were both together.

Ok, so let's do it.

Ok, ladies, we've got to
sort this out.

How do we know that we'll be safe?

You're safer with us than the cops.

Bounty hunters have a lot of leeway.

Well, how is that going to stop
the mob from coming after us?

Don't worry, we'll stop them.

So, what's it going to be?

Are you going to tell us
what you know so we can help you?

We do know Franco.

In fact, we've been working for him.

How?

Well,

when the feds started tapping
the Gallarus family hangouts,

they still needed information
so they used us as a go-between

Frank would come into the club,
take us into the VIP room

for a couple of hours and later
when one of the bosses would come buy

we'd give him al the information
that he gave us.

I thought one of
the other families own Dazzles.

Why would they
let the Gallarus family use it.

Honor among thieves and a big payoff.

Plus everybody hates the feds.

So, what kind of things
did Franco tell you?

Names, numbers, that kid of stuff.

Boring.

Do you recognize
any of the names there?

I think one of those
is a Senator or something.

That's it.

He sometimes passed on information
about meetings between people.

Yeah, Franco had me do that
last month.

He had me meeting a guy
named Auriana?

Luis Auriana?

That's him.

Who's that?

They just fished Luis Auriana

out of the river
with a bullet in his eye.

That makes you two accessories
to murder.

Look, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, here.

Dusty, I'm not fooling around.

I need to find this Franco character.

Do you know where he's at?

He was going to tell us about
where all this money was

so we could bring it to him.

Why would he come your place
and try to kill you?

He probably thought we were
going to try to rip him off

and take his money.

We never even got a chance
to get the money.

That doesn't make sense.

You know how these guys are.

You look at them crosseyed
and they shoot you.

Why wouldn't get just
get his own money?

Because he hit it at Dazzles.

So, he wouldn't go there,
because they think he's a rat.

So did he tell you
where to take it?

He has a farm out in the country
I wrote down the address.

Does anyone else know where this is?

Just us.

You think he still might be in there?

It's worth taking a look.

I'll go.

No. Let me.

I want you to stay here
and keep an eye on these two.

This isn't you trying to pull
some kind of fast one, is it?

Give me a break.

I'm just going to go up there.
If I find him, I'll call you.

Meanwhile,
don't let them out of your sight.

There's something about their story
that doesn't sit well with me.

Let me guess. Women's intuition?

Too bad, you don't have it.

Don't worry.
They'll be safe with me.

We're hungry.

Then go get something to eat.
Don't bother me.

Yeah.

Hey Tom, it's me.

Did you find him?

No. But I've got a really strong lead.

Who'd you get it from?

Jasmine and Dusty.

I told you that they knew more
than what they were saying.

Where are you? I'll send backup.

I don't need backup.

JC, I'm not fooling around here
alright?

Neither am I.

I'll call you when I find them.

Yeah, it's me.

We've got a problem.

Ring, ring.

Yeah.

I'm here.

Did you find him?

No.

Just getting ready to scope out
the place.

How's our guests?

They're fine.

Just chattering away in the bedroom.

You've got to keep an eye on them.

What would you like me to do,
sit on them?

If you have to.

Fine.

Call me if you find anything.

Fine.

I'll watch them, dammed it.

Ladies.

Shit.

Hi.

What are you doing?

What does it look like we're doing?

Ok, as long as you're both safe.

Oh, our hero.

Right.

Hey Lance,

Jasmine told me about you two.

Really?

She says you're really good.

She's right.

And cocky, too.

Would you like to join us?

In there?

To start.

Doesn't look like there's room.

We can make room.

Help us.

Look,

we can't tell JC about this, alright?

What is she,
your girlfriend or something?

No, but I don't think
she'd understand.

She doesn't know how to have fun

Speaking of which
I think we're ready for another round.

I think I need a little time.

Come on. Let's get kinky.

Ok, I like that. I'll play along.

Hey!

What are you doing?

Don't worry.
We're not going to tell anybody.

Yes, it's done. He's all yours.

Remember the deal.

Fine, we'll be at the club.

You're just going to leave me.

Sorry, baby.

You were good, but not that good.

It's time to go.

Bye.

Wait!

Come back.

You cant just leave me here.

Help.

Bounty hunter locked up
in his own handcuffs.

Not good. Come back.

Who sent you?

I ask the questions.

Frank Morita, I presume.

I'm taking you in.

Just you. Give me a break.

It looks like you're
the one in bracelets.

What are you, a cop?

Bounty hunter.

Terrific.

Hey, these things are kind of
pinching me a little bit.

What's so funny?

You're kind of whiny
for a ruthless hitman.

Don't believe everything you hear.

By the way, Dusty's fine.

That's good to hear.

I guess that we'll add attempted
murder to your rap sheet.

Come again.

Jasmine pointed you for tossing
shots at her and Dusty.

When?

Don't be cute.

Listen, I just spoke to
Jasmine an hour ago.

She didn't say anything
about any shots.

What?

You're not the only one
with a cell phone.

Oh., Gallarus' thugs.

You led them right to me.

I wasn't followed.

Tell them that.

Come on.

Well, if it isn't the little rat.

It took you long enough to find me.

You like all this fresh air?

Well, maybe you won't choke
when you dig your own grave.

No one's digging anything.
Drop your guns.

Next time, I don't miss.

Say hello to the bounty hunter
who caught me.

You want to keep playing?

I'd be more help
if you got me out of these.

You got it.

Franco,
you and your girlfriend are dead

Dead!

Shut up.

What are you doing?

Let's get out of here
before more goons show up.

What's that?

It's Dusty's address.

These are probably the guys
who tried to knock them off.

Come on.

I'm still taking you in.

Well, then I'm as good as dead.

I've got contacts at the D. A's office.

Tom Cooper promised
that you'd be safe.

Oh, Christ!

Tom Cooper's the guy I'm running from.

What?

The guy's been on the take for years.

That's a lie.

I have proof.

Why do you think there's never
been a major prosecution

of the Gallari family?

The D.A. Is in their back pocket.

Shut up and get in the car.

Hey, you don't want to believe me?

I'm telling you the truth.
I said shut up.

Fine. Fine.

Is this really necessary?

You tell me.

Believe me, I'm tired of running.

But you're so good at it.

Don't you want to know the proof
I have about Cooper?

I don't believe a word you're saying.

Then believe this.

The mob never likes
writing things down.

Me, I've got to keep records.

Take a look at that
and tell me what you think.

Why do you trust me?

Because you didn't take me in.

Yet.

Yet, you still didn't do it.

So maybe, just maybe,
you think I'm telling the truth.

I want to prove that to you.

And bring me back some food.

Yes, kiss my butt.

Come on, come on.

Benny?

If I've told you once,

I've told you a thousand times
to freaking knock.

Listen, I got to talk.

Did you ever hear of a phone?

I'm serious.

Listen.

It's ok. I know the routine.
Call me.

I will.

Before you say anything, don't.

I'm actually dating her.

Is that what you're calling it?

I'm serious. She could be the one.

Did you ever think that
she might be playing you?

Oh, man.

Look, I don't have time to talk
about your love life.

I've got Franco.

Alright. Bring him in.

Not so fast.

What do you mean "not so fast"?

The D.A.'s office is on the take.

If he goes in,

they'll turn him over
to the Gallari family.

Now, who's being played?

They named Tom specifically.

Oh, boy.

What's this?

I'm Detective Simpson.
This is my partner, Detective Jensen.

Evening.

J.C. Lang?

Yeah?

We came by to ask Benny
how we could find you

this will make it easier.

What do you mean "easier"?

J.C. Lang, you're under arrest
for the Murder of Lance Hall.

What?
Let's go.

You have the right to remain silent.

Benny!

Anything you say
can and will be used against you

in a court of law.
I'm on it. I'm on it.

You have a right to an attorney.

Get me out of this, Benny!

If you do not have an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

How are you doing?

Doing?

How am I doing?

I'm in a jail cell on murder charges
I don't know anything about.

How do you think I'm doing?

Ok, let's calm down.

Oh, you come in here and calm down.

Hey, I'm trying to help you.

Then what the hell's going on?

A caller phoned in a tip,

said there were gunshots
at your house.

The police came over

and found Lance handcuffed
to your bed, dead.

The gun that was used was yours
and it was right next to his body.

Do you honestly think
I'd be that sloppy?

I mean, what's my motive?

J.C., listen.

What about the working girls
that he was looking after?

Gone.

Great.

Did you find Franco on the farm?

No. No ones up there,

but I got some strong leads
and I'm working on them,

but I cant do anything in here.

Listen, I know that this is all

trumped up,
circumstantial evidence.

But you still managed
to get me arrested.

I had to. I was just doing my job.

I didn't have anything to do
with Lance's murder.

J.C. Listen.

I'll do everything I can
to make this go away.

Alright. Alright.

Let her out.

What's this?

It's called bail, Tom.

It's what I do.

Good. I'm glad. J.C., call me.

Sure.

How are you doing, J. C?

Get me out of here.

Did you look at this?

No way.

Come on. Let's go.

I thought you'd forgotten about me.

I was afraid that
I was going to chew my arm off.

What's the matter?

You found out that
I was telling the truth?

It's all a bunch of numbers
and initials.

It's hardly a smoking gun.

Well, match these numbers
with the deposits that

were made into these accounts.

How hard is that?

Things got a little complicated.

I was arrested for murder.

Who?

The guy that I was working with
to catch you.

Did he know where
you were coming to look for me?

Yeah.

And that's how they found us.

They got to him to look for me.

Lance would never talk.

You'd be amazed at what someone would
say with a gun pointed to his head.

Tom knew. He asked about the farm.

Huh?

Tom asked if I found you at the farm.

I called him on the way up,

but I never mentioned that
I was going to a farm.

He must've tipped off
those two thugs to get to Lance

and then, eventually, get to us.

You get grabbed up on murder charges.

To slow me down.

That's what it sounds like.

He also got Jasmine to blame you
for the shootings,

which means he didn't want
the thugs to get caught,

so they could finish
what they started.

He not only had deals
with Jasmine and Dusty,

but also with the Gallaris.

That son of a bitch.

I don't know what to think anymore.

I'm sorry.

What I don't understand is
how you fit into the picture.

I mean you're supposed to be
this ruthless hitman

and that that's hardly what you are.

What's the matter? I don't scare you?

That's not it.

I know a murderer
and you're not a murderer.

I'm a lover. Sorry, bad joke.

What's your story?

Growing up in my neighborhood,
the mob guys were everywhere.

They had the best clothes,
the best cars, the best women.

I wanted to be one of them,

but I wasn't a wiseguy.

I did know about numbers.

Gambling?

No, accounting.

Hey, give me a break.
It's what I was good at.

I was working for the Gallaris family,
doing their books.

As a joke, some of the guys
made up a joke that...

I had been killing people.

The next thing you knew,
the rumors started flying

and people started looking at me
very differently.

There was actually a lot of fear
in their eyes.

And you liked that?

I have to admit that I did.

And then things got way out of hand.

Drugs?

I was stupid.

I was carrying packages
back and forth.

The cops found out

and I was threatened
with some serious jail time.

So, why did Tom offer protection?

It was all a show.

But if Tom was in on it,
why would it happen?

Because shit runs down hill.

The new mayor puts pressure
on the Attorney General,

he puts pressure on the D.A.s.

The D.A.'s squeeze the A.D. A's
like Tom.

So Tom's supervisors
knew nothing about this?

That's the beauty of the plan.

A guy like tom's job

is to make sure stuff doesn't go
any higher.

Do you mind?

What were you going to do on the run?

Well, I was the guy
who kept the books,

I have a little stash set
aside for myself.

I hid it over at Dazzles.

That's what Dusty told me.

Right. She and Jasmine called me
just before all this happened.

I told her where it was.

And you trusted them?

I just thought that,

because we had spent time together,
that there was a bond between us.

I thought I could trust them.

I was stupid.

There... you happy?

It looks like we both put
our trust in the wrong people.

What are you thinking?

What my next move should be?

You can always testify.

I wouldn't live long enough
to finish one sentence.

Let me ask you something.

Do you like your job?

For now, it's working.

It's what I identify with,
like you and the wiseguys.

I notice that
you haven't taken me in yet.

Isn't that breaking some kind of law?

I'm not bound to the same laws
as the cops.

You're just a reward to me.
I can take you in at any time.

So, is that it?

I'm just some guy
with a price tag on his head?

In the beginning, it was like that?

And now?

Now, things have gotten
a little complicated.

I got to you, didn't I?

Don't get so cocky?

What can I say, I got the goods.

I'm not a working girl.
You don't need to impress me.

No. You're a girl on the run,
just like me.

Suddenly nothing makes sense
and you're scared.

Welcome to my world.

I'm a lot of things,
but scared isn't one of them.

I'm tired of running.

Dammit!

What's the rush?

I thought that
we'd have breakfast in bed.

Of course, we'd have to
get a bed first.

How are you doing?

Good, now.

Where am I going to go?

I need you to keep me safe.

Benny, hey.

Yeah, I know where Franco is.

Hey, I need a favor.

Got a minute?

Always for you.

Did you find Franco?

I did.

Well, where is he?
Let's get him locked up.

Hold on.

He told me some things about you

that you've been taking bribes
from the Gallaris family.

He's a scumbag and a crook.
Don't believe anything he says.

I know all about this guy.

I don't believe anything.

Besides, I trust you.

That's good.

You look really nice tonight.

Do you have a date or something?

This is it, baby?

Really?

Slow down.

You want to get it all over you, huh?

What's wrong?

Just checking to see
if you were wearing a wire?

A wire?

Shut up.

So, the rat told you everything?

He just told me that
you've been taking bribes for years.

Did he tell you how much?

No.

Because it's nothing.

I've been keeping those
scumbags out of jail for years

and how do they repay me?
Shit.

I cant believe this.

You think you've got it
all figured out, don't you?

I know where all the skeletons
are buried.

I'm about to make a big play.

It's time for an early retirement

and the Gallaris family
is going to pay for it.

I cant believe that you've been lying
to me for all these years.

You're so pathetic.

JC Lang, the great bounty hunter.

Is that how you get off,
chasing down guys?

Always did have to be in charge
didn't you?

Times have changed.

Who are you calling?

A special friend to take care of you.

Just like they took care of
that Lance character.

So, you did tip off the hit men
to get to Lance.

They killed him and then
they came after me and Franco.

Yeah, I did.

They made a mess of it.

Just like they made a mess of
those two hookers.

They figured they knew
where Franco was hiding

and it turned out that
they were right.

I had to go in and clean it up.

Here's the great thing,

I cut a deal with Dusty and Jasmine.

They get a
"Get out of jail free" card

and I get Franco's stash.

Perfect plan.

Those girls are playing you
like they're playing me.

They led me to Franco,

because they knew where his stash was.

They were hoping I could catch him.

They've been wanting
to rip him off the whole time.

And you trust that.

Those girls know that
if they cross me,

they'll end up just like Lance.

My god, what happened to you?

Welcome to the real world.

You grab what you can while you can.

It's not that America's Most
wanted crap that you play

The only problem is you're not good at
your games Tommy, but me...

I'm very good.

Can I help you gentlemen?

Yes.

Tom Cooper, you're under arrest.

What is this?

You think that just because
I don't have a wire

that I'm not being transmitted?

Yeah, Benny.

Take him in.
Let's go, Cooper.

It's a long way from over.

I just wish that I could've seen
the look on his face.

Priceless.

Now, you can testify and not worry.

I can't do that.

Franco.

J.C., just because the rats are
out of the D.A.'s office

doesn't mean I'm clear.

Gallaris will never let me live
to stand trial.

Well, there's always
witness protection.

That's not for me.

What are you going to do?

I don't know.
I just wish I had my nest egg.

Well, maybe there's some way
that I can help with that.

That's pretty cool that
the D.A. Got arrested.

And we're the only ones
who know about the money.

Here's to men.
Here's to suckers.

Room service.

Come in.

What do you think we should
give him for a tip?

You know, ladies.

The next time you go on
a spending spree,

you might want to be
a little more discreet.

Well, I guess this is it for a while.

You never know.

Without Tom covering for them,
the Gallaris might go sown.

If they do, maybe I'll come back.

Where are you going?

If I tell you,
it would cause more trouble.

You don't think I couldn't find you?

Actually I'd like to be hunted by you.

Count on it.

The End.
