Chico, Guido's CarWash.

Benny, El Fresco High prom.
Nick, Newmark Mall.

And Alvin, missing Essex kid.

Trixie, army-navy store. Putyour name
in there. Let's go to work, people!

Alvin, that was my case!
Ramon said you weren't interested.

I know what Ramon says
to my backwhen I'm not here.

You're late again, Pedro.

You gotta find a very good reason
to do that to me, Ramon...

and even then you can't find it.

Buzz off!. You don't sound sick.
You promised me a case!

It's time to fish or get offthe pot.

What?
Well, you're not readyyet.

In uniform at the army-navy store
oryou're fired!

Sounds good, don't it?

It sounds good. The thing is,
is it gonna be good?

Come on. Come on.

I got to go.
All right.

Hey.

Hey, Trixie.

What?

Tasty morsel, ain't he?

More what?

You are interested in men, right?

C'est la vie.

" La vie."

Everything cool?
Yeah. Everything's fine.

Yeah, everything's fine.
You know what?

I was standing over there, and I saw
you put that CD down your pants.

You did?
Yeah.

Where wereyou standing?

I didn't seeyou put a CD down your
pants. Is that whatyou're telling me?

Okay, we can do this the easyway,
orwe can-- Hey, where areyou--

He's got a knife!

Oh, my God! Help me.
Somebody get help!

You're gonna be fine.

Hey, Trixie, listen, we're taking up
a collection for Ricardo...

so, you know, ten, five bucks--
whateveryou got.

What, do you want change?

Forty bucks?

Trixie, a friend called last night.

They're looking for casino security
up at Crescents Cove.

Pickpockets, mostly. The regular
security handles the rough stuff.

You don't even need a piece.

No guns?

Foryou, maybe a little makeup.

They need an answer, like, now.

Good references.
Great physicals.

You know how to gamble, Miss Zurbo?
Blackjack? Craps?

Yes, ma'am. Back in Chicago my brother
took me to a private club...

for members
and nonmembers only...

and they showed me
how they do it.

There's nobody else, Angie.
There is nobody else.

Miss Zurbo? Trixie?

You got the job.
Hours are 9:00 to 5:00.

P.M. to A.M.

Watching the late, late show

Don'tyou wishyou were there
instead ofhere

Snuggled in an armchair
with a bottle ofbeer

Anthony Newley!

On your TV
when you're sitting at home

This is the biggest jackpot
you've ever won!

Okay.

The strawberries.
That's where I had them.

I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt,
and with perfect geometric logic...

that an identical key
to the icebox did exist...

and I'd have produced that key ifthey
hadn't pulled the Caine out of action.

Of course...

I can only recall these things
from memory.

I'll be glad to answer
any questions you may have.

Can I get my soda, please?
You got it.

One by one by one.

Would anyone care
for a jawbreaker?

That's whatyousee
whenyou're sitting at home

New lady bear, right?

" Lady bear?"

You're under cover.
Straw, no ice.

Thanks.
We both know that.

How'd you know we both know?

Ifyou knew, I wouldn't know.

And if I knew,
you sure wouldn't know, either.

I was just saying
you look real good out there.

Did you ever take a look
at the superstars?

You know what their thing is?

It's hair.

You're gonna be a star,
you gotta know how to fix your hair.

And I got plenty of it.

Cagneybelting Bogey

And Edward G. with his stogie

You see that guy
right over there?

He wants you.

You're out ofyour rocker.
I don't even know him.

He wants every woman
that walks into this place.

Come here.
He don't wear any drawers.

A real statue of Adonis.

But I still hate him.

Mae West,
"Oh, come up andsee me"

And Chevalier with his
"Mimi, Mimi"

How rude.

I'm Ruby Pearli.

Been coming here foryears.

It's Trixie, right?

Won'tyou come home, Bill Bailey
Won'tyou come home

And watch the late, late show

Listen, I'm gonna make him
an offer he can't refuse.

I watch the late, late show

Norman, look. The loons!

Watching that late, late show

We're coming up on 6:30 in the morning
here in Crescents Cove.

Kind ofa chilly morning...

about 50 degrees out there,
but don'tyou folks worry.

I think we'll get to 70 degrees this
afternoon when those clouds clear off...

and it'll be a nice day
down by the lake.

$ " Grizley's Motor Court"

Thank you for being
such a wonderful audience.

There's a lot of love i n this room,
ladies and gentlemen.

It's either that
or carbon monoxide.

But, seriously,
ifyou're driving tonight...

please don't forgetyour car.

Mr. Stans, that was fantastic.

We sawyou in that community telethon
you did with What's-his-name.

You were so good.
Thanks.

Ifyou're ever down
in the McAllen-Brownsville area...

we have a tractor pull in late August,
and you are most welcome.

I won't miss it.
Thankyou.

The price offame.

So how goes the dawn patrol?

Job like that's gotta be tough.

I can handle it.

I'm sureyou can handle it.

Betyou don't spend
even one second concerned...

whether blood's bubbling
from a guy's mouth or not.

You can't just sit there like
a sore thumb. I'll tell you that much.

Exactly.

Right away, Mr. Stans.

You're very observant.

Drinking into oblivion
is my second-favorite hobby.

Drinking into a stupor
is my first.

I do it to remember.

Or forget, I'm never sure which.

So, Miss Trix...

where areyou from?

I was born in Chicago.
Guess I'm from there.

My kind oftown, Chicago is.

It's okay.
Family there?

They died, mostly.

My mom died.
She had cancer from cigarettes.

My brother died too.

He was a cop.

He was a good cop.

My sister Gloria moved
to Minnesota with her husband.

She's expecting a baby.

But I don't know if I'm
gonna be an uncle or an auntyet.

I haven't met my father...

so he may not be dead.

Though plenty of people
around his age are dead now...

so he could be dead.

I loved my brother.

Yeah.

Know what I love, Trixie?

No.

I love how we go on.

And we all somehow manage...

to just keep going on.

Yeah.

I came up here 'cause I think that
there were brighter clouds ahead for me.

Like this job.

And you're an expert at finding
your man, aren'tyou, Trixie?

And keeping him ifyou want.

I haven't been
on an actual caseyet...

but I know that when I get
on the trail of somebody...

I'm gonna get him
by hook or by ladder.

See, a lot of guys out there
think that it's about 50-50...

between the evidence thatyou find
and your own institution.

But I think
that it's just the opposite.

I thinkyou gotta
grab the bull by the tail...

and look it in the eye.

And I guess I'm different
in that way.

You're different, all right.
In a lot ofways.

Exceptyou're not a guy.

I'm a feminine--
I'm female.

You mean a woman.

Yeah. A woman.

And in your case, I'm sure
that's just the tip ofthe iceberg.

But what about danger, Trixie?

Danger?
Yeah.

Can you handle it?

Notjust cops and robbers,
but demons in the underbrush.

When it's a matter
ofyou or them.

Like, doyou mean,
do I have an ace up my hole?

No, I mean...

could you pull the trigger?

Bang.

Okay.

Well...

there's only one person besides me who
could saywhat I'd do, and that's me.

I see.

Doctor, refill my prescription.

That guy smokes like a fish.

You mean Dex?
Mr. Dexterous?

He works for Red Rafferty.

Who's Red Rafferty?

Land developer, entrepreneur...

and a vulgarian
of the highest order.

You mean like the Shriners?

Let's just say...

removing warts from his ass
might be called brain surgery.

You know what I mean?

Hey, Robert Goulet!

Yes, Robert Goulet.

Uncanny, isn't it?

So what does Mr. Dexterous do?

Mr. Dexterous
butters his own bread.

He's Red's deckhand,
jack-of-all-trades...

probably pokes Red's wife
when Red's out of town.

Red's usually busy
with his girlfriend Dawn.

Although I'm sure
Dawn does all the work.

But what do I know?

I like the accordion.

Hey, that's my favorite music!
How did I know that?

See, we're each tap dancers
in the canoe oflife.

Whatyou must do, Trixie,
is tip well.

That's what my mom taught me.

She was a waitress.

She said,
"Ifyou tip a better amount...

you'll feel good aboutyourself,
which helps your bone structure."

Of course it does.

It's certainly helped yours.

One simple glance tells me
how generous you are.

I've seen that guy here before.
I don't trust him.

That woman's tongue
is highly contagious.

Egads, listen to that.
I'm already starting to sound like her.

Okay, shooter coming out.

Lucky six.
Six is rolled.

The view from here
is spectacular.

But always be up front with a lady.
You winning?

What?
No, I'm not winning.

Well, nowyou are.

I'm Dex.

Short for Dexter, Ambidextrous--

It's not my name at all,
but that's what it's short for.

I missed yours.

A quiet girl.

Shoo.

What do I look like,
a fly or something?

Yeah. You look like a fly.
Now go away.

Let me see whatyou got.

I've lived here 20 years.
Seen that water turn from blue to black.

It's the developers.

Says here that the government's
gonna help save it from itself.

" Light at the end ofthe tunnel"?
More like an oncoming train.

This is my regular hangout.
This is my regulartable.

That's where I sit.

Not now.

Quiet girl.

Would you stop saying that?
I am not quiet.

Relax. It's a compliment.

Coffee, Dex?

Yes.
The usual?

Yeah.
Medium rare.

Right.

You wanna stay competitive, you should
eat something more substantial...

Iike a nice, thickjuicy steak.

I wouldn't eat a steak
ifitwas on a ten-foot pole.

Steak eaters are superior people.

You can eat steaks up the kazoo,
but not me.

So how 'bout it?

You wanna make love
with me tonight?

Okay.

Okay, but you can't
blame a guy for asking.

See, I know what women want.

So I'm polite, and I ask 'em.

You do like guys, don'tyou?

I wish I had an answer
for that question...

'cause I am really getting tired
ofanswering it.

Why? Don'tyou know?

A virgin maybe?

No, too old.

I mean, you're probably
not that active.

I could see how
you might like girls.

But a virgin?
No, I don't think so.

Why do people always have
to beat a dead horse to death?

Everybody talks about sex, so it ain't
no big deal most ofthe time.

Butyou know why they talk
about it so much, don'tyou?

You know?

Because they don't do it.

You see, I do it,
I talk about it...

and I make no bones.

Except maybe the one.

So what doyou say, quiet girl?
You a virgin, orwhat?

No, I am not a virgin, okay?

Neither am I.

I didn't think so.

So how was it foryou?

See? This is what I'm talking about,
and it burns my ass.

Ifyou're gonna be stingy,
whywaste it on an amateur?

Most guys, they don't know
how to touch a woman.

You have no idea.

Listen, I'm not a bad guy.

You should take
some time to know me.

I don't have to knowyou,
'cause I already knowya.

Right.

The sleuth. Okay.

How's about doing a little sleuthing
right now? See how closeyou come.

Pretty simple, I'm sure.

I dareyou.

Let me see, now.

You've been buttering up
your own nest.

You've gone to the top
ofthe tree...

and you have caught
the tip ofthe iceberg.

Doyou hearyourselftalking
when you speak?

'Cause this is some lame shit.
You're disappointing me.

Oh, yeah? Okay.

Number one:

I'd sayyou're a Jekyll-of-all-trades
for an ass named Red Rafferty.

Number two:

Your main job is when he's not in town,
when he's some place else...

so thatyou can guard
the body ofhis wife...

ifyou're not too busy
posing for statues of Adidas.

How am I doing?

Medium rare.

We can sleep as late as we want.
Nothing to bother us.

Just the waves lapping
against theyacht where I live.

Well, you already know
that it's Red's charter boat...

but I live there
all by my lonesome.

Massage those tired feet ofyours.

Makeyou laugh.

When's the last time
you had a really good laugh?

Don't monkey around.
I'm working.

First a fly, now a monkey?

That really hurts.
I'm not even human toyou.

I didn't say that.

Hey, I got 20/20 hearing.

I didn't mean it.

Most people condescend
from monkeys anyways.

Did you learn that in school?
No.

I had to quit school in fifth grade
to take care of my mom.

I hated school.

My old man wanted me to go
to college, be a big success like him.

But I turned my back on all that.
Who needs all that money, anyway?

I only need what I want.
Dex.

So...

you halfin love with meyet?

Hop aboard.

I don't know how.

Just come to the end
and step across.

What ifit sinks?

Can't swim?

Of course I can swim,
but not ifI'm on a boat.

I've never been
on a boat before.

Just step across.
Watch the slippery part.

Okay.

Okay.
You're all right.

You're all right.

Okay?

Oh, shit.

I am totally naked
without any clothes on.

Yeah.

Turn around.

Listen, I forgot about
this cruise I got today.

You can handle it.

You'll have a ball.

Stay right there. I'll be right back.
Bring my clothes.

What cakeyou pop out of?

Loverboy's latest, eh?

I guess he's slippin'.

Red, sorry. She's--
I know what she is.

You just getyour ass up there
and sprinkle roses for the Senator...

and you get out some cashew nuts.

The good ones.

Dex, I want my clothes.
Now!

Yeah. Right. Okay.

He's an idiot.
What's your excuse?

Do you speak?

Let me see something.

Excuse me.

I'm Red Rafferty.
This is my boat.

I know this is your boat.
You're Red Rafferty.

That's what I said.

Hey, Red, Senator Avery's car's
pulling up right now.

It's too bad foryou I got
more important things to do right now.

Let's hope there's enough
life jackets to go around.

That's all I got to say about it.

The loose fish is okay, loverboy.
She might even come in handy.

Ifyou can't keep quiet, shut up.

Should be fun, huh?
I want my clothes.

You look great. Really.

You may be a big clog in his wheels,
but not in mine.

I just want to get off.

I knew that.

Go away.

What a life, huh?

Yeah, it's a party
of doom and gloom.

I like to come out here
and let my mind swing free.

You don't wanna letyour mind
swing too free. You'd loseyour head.

Don'tyou worry
about that with me, sir.

What is it going
to be, Drummond?

You want the usual?
Yeah. Scotch, neat.

Two?
Two fingers.

'Cause I know
what can happen to you.

Ifl start pouring these drinks,
things can--

Walt, you know what
the best audience is?

What's that?

Intelligent, a little educated,
and damn drunk.

I'll keep that in mind.

Jesus, watch it!
You want me to crash or something?

Turn this boat right around now,
oryou are dead meat in thewater.

I alreadyforgot about this
goddamn cruise because ofyou.

I crash the boat, six people
including the state senator drown.

And it's your fault.

Yesterday I didn't get to say
something that needs repeatin'.

I don't wanna ever seeyou again.

And I don't wantyou ever
to see me again, either.

Boy's got a new girlfriend,
and he's turned into a maniac.

Kind ofinteresting, though.

Listen, Avery, I was just
thinking ofsomething.

Who's that?
Red's partners.

Her.

Her?

Red's friend. A singer.
Dawn Sloane.

And you know her, don'tyou?
Even though she's older.

I got a good one
foryou, Drummond.

Oh, yeah? What's that?

How can you tell
a Polack at a cockfight?

He's the one with the duck.
One with the duck. That's not bad.

How doyou tell a wop
at a cockfight?

He's the one bettin'
on the duck.

Bettin' on the duck, eh?
How doyou tell the Mob's been there?

I don't know. I thinkwe gotta vote
for some senators with breasts.

We've been voting
for boobs long enough.

The duckwins.

The duckwins.
I don't get that one.

I'm absolutely ravishing.
Where's the food?

Well, the nuts are over there.

Happyyet?

Hey, no!
I'll go.

Check out Miss America here!

Hey, fish, how would you like
to be in a movie?

You got any talent there?
Let me checkyou out.

Sid, when I wantyour opinion,
I'll give it toyou, okay?

Walter, exactlywhere
is that property line ofyours?

In your pocket?
I'll showyou. Okay, fish.

What areyou doing?
You getyour hands off me.

Easy, Red. Take a look at her.
She ain't worth it.

You get this punch bunny
off my boat...

or I'm gonna toss you both
over face first, you got it?

You and what army?
Okay, here we go!

All right. All right.
Hold it.

Wait a minute!

All right, hold it.
Hold it now.

Hold it a second!
I'm all right.

Hold it.
I'm all right.

Now listen to me.

I'm gonna say one thing...

and I'm gonna say it once.

This is like a circus.

You people are behaving
like clowns.

And it's embarrassing. I'm supposed
to be out here enjoying myself!.

And, quite frankly,
this behavior--

this clown behavior--
is a little scary for me.

As a child, my father
took me to the circus...

and a clown killed him.

Walter, I wantyou to apologize
to this young lady.

I wantyou to behave a little more
gentlemanly towards her.

I mean...

this young lady right here
might tearyou apart!

She might just ripyou a new asshole.
You might be right about that.

Yeah, come on.
Show me this property line ofyours.

Come on over here.
How much moneyyou got in the bank?

Let me see.

Okay, Trixie.

Come on.

All right.
That's it.

Happy now?
Huh, baby?

Baby's not happy.

Okay, I told you I'd get you here
safe and sound, didn't I?

That's it.

I know whereyou live, Trixie.

I can makeyou talk to me.

You're not
very hungry today, honey.

You get some sleep.

What a little shock!

You want a tampon or a lollipop?
Little goodies. Anything?

So what'd you do on your day off?

Spend it with all
the wrong people, like Dex?

Did he takeyou on one
ofthose floating orgies...

with Red and that phony slut Dawn?

How old areyou, anyways?

Here, look foryourself.

I don't got two pair ofhands.
You read it to me.

I got one that says "29."

One says "22."

"Sixteen."

Jiggers, the heat!

Make that two jiggers.

So how's Trix?

What's wrong, sunshine?
Nobody to playwith?

Tell me more about those guys.
Which guys?

Red Rafferty and the DeFlore brothers.
They look like phonographers.

Don't go fishing in darkwaters.
Forget about them.

They're lethal.

You mean like they got
good lawyers and stuff?

No. Lethal as in deadly.

For the DeFlores,
it's always about fists.

Vince was 1 4 before he knew
he had fingers.

Then again, inbreeding is how
we get championship horses.

As for Red...

to put it
soyou might understand...

the sword of Damocles is hanging
over Pandora's Box.

Is that like cutting offyour nose
in spite ofyour face?

Close.

Red can't afford to build
overpriced condominiums...

because schmoes like us
can't afford to buy them.

You might say
his limits are limitless.

And the politics guy?

Big fish in a small pond.

I'd love to be an eardropper
on thewall when they're talking.

Kirk, anotherfive minutes.

Five minutes.

Towhat? I've left more people
than this in bed.

What about Dawn Sloane?
I mean, she's no fried chicken.

Oh, baby, now
Yeah,yeah

All overyou

That's her.

Wow
What can I do

Oh, baby, now
Yeah,yeah

Want to complete 20 questions...

and ask what
I think of Dex Lang?

No.

I quit Red tonight.

Unloaded on
the sadistic son of a bitch.

He's being shitty to Dawn.

They're crazy.
You don't know the half ofit.

Goddamn crooked politician.

I did not like the way
he was looking atyou.

I've neverwanted a woman
the way I wantyou.

Wait. Shit.

Wait. Hold on.
Oh, yeah. Come on.

Wait a second.

Where's Dawn?

Where is she?

Where's the goddamn tape?

Come on, Sid.
He don't know nothin'.

Seeya later.

Quit screwing around, Sid.
All right, let's eat. I'm hungry.

Chinese?
Sure.

When I was a kid, I got hit
on the head with a bowling ball...

and I woke up unconscious.

My mom took me
to the hospital forX-rays...

but they didn't find nothing.

Quiet, girl.

I'm outgoing.

Quiet.

I don't care.
Inside I'm outgoing.

You started to make
some noise there.

Unplug these tubes and help me up.
You can't move, Dex.

I can't stay here.

They'll find her.

This is your chance, Trixie.

You've gotta find Dawn first.

No matterwhere it leads.

Orwho it hurts.

What did he mean about a tape?

He's just a frightened
little baby boy.

He's okay, Ruby.
No, he's not.

Let me go.

He's still in love with her.
Isn't he?

She's gonna get him killed,
you know.

She's the devil.

Doyou know Dawn Sloane well enough
to be acquainted with her?

Do I know Dawn Sloane?

First it was her,
then it was me...

now it's you?

Doyou know any family
that she might be related to?

Mr. Slotnick--Jacob...

I need to talkwith you
aboutyour sister's case...

'cause there's a lot of uncertainty
that's not clear in my mind.

But could we go inside first?

It's probably not so cold there.

Doyou live here alone
byyourself,Jacob?

Yup.

Does your sister Dawn
ever come here?

Nope.

Why not?

Mostlywe'd just argue.

You've been arguing with Dawn?

Nope.

You haven't been arguing with Dawn?
No.

No, you haven't been arguing?
Yes.

Yes.
That's right.

Okay, so...

when was the last time
that you saw Dawn...

with your own eyes?

Couple ofyears ago.

Christmas.

Did she ever say
that she had some trouble?

Dorothy stays away from trouble.

Dorothy?
Stays away from trouble.

Do you have any idea where she'd go
if she had some trouble...

and she wanted
to stay away from it?

Nope.

These questions
are for clues to follow.

Ifyou don't have clues...

the bread and butter can be cut
right out from underyour feet...

and then if anything bad happens,
there's only one person to blame...

and that's each other.

She calls.

On the phone?
Well, of course on the phone.

So...

when was the last time that she
called you on the phone around?

This morning.

Dawn Sloane called you
this morning?

Yup. On the phone.
Well, why didn'tyou say so?

I just did.

Can I helpyou?
Who's in room 304?

Why?

We're old friends.
She'd be a parasite for sore eyes.

What's she look like?

Hair that men like...

and looks like a lymphomaniac.

Yeah, that's her.
Is she alone?

I just bring the food.

Who is it?

It's the person
who makes the room clean.

The maiden.

What doyou want?

I got towels.

What areyou doing?

I've seen you--

You get out.

How did you find me?
Nobody knows where I am.

Bring a black pot
ofhot coffee right away.

We've only got silver pots.
-Just do it.

It was so sick...

what they made me do.

They didn't have to go that far.

But...

I got 'em good now.

I'm gonna get $1 00,000 from him.

Maybe, I don't know, 200,000.

Ifl can just get his secretary
to give him the messages.

What?
We're gettin' out ofhere.

No. No, I've got
to have a drink.

No.
Please give me the bottle.

You are not drinking yourself
into Bolivia.

Where?

Who areyou?

I'm me.

You are goofy.

Nobody ever told you that before?

It's not irrelevant right now.

You're never gonna get a guy.

I mean, look.
This is what guys want, okay?

Let's get real.

You probably don't even like men.

Maybe you're lucky.

Doesn't matter.

Dex is the one.

He makes me feel special.

Okay.

You tell Avery
the ball is in his court now.

I'm gonna make him
a special deal.

Fifty thousand
for the tape tonight.

Fifty thousand's good
for both sides, right?

A sex scandal's gotta
be worth that much, huh?

We'll split it. You and me.

I just--

I want to get away--
I want to get away from everybody.

I want to just--

I want mywhole life
to be different.

Before it's too late for me.

Night and day

Day and night

I never do anything worthwhile.

God doesn't love me anymore.

That's not true.

Forget it.
I can't forget it.

I'm the worst person alive.

I make one mistake after another.

I've ruined my career.

Hey, nobody's human.
It's the way things are.

All right?
Now we gotta go.

I want to go to sleep.

Later. Come on. Put on some shoes,
'cause I am driving you back in my car.

No. No, no, no, they'll find me.

I'm staying right here,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

Dawn, your life has gone
to hell in a handbag.

I don't care.

You just--
You call Avery right now.

Oryou get out!

Room service.

It's only four bucks, lady.

I don't wantyou letting anybody
into this room when I'm not here...

unless I recognize them.

Or I'll beatyou up good.

Excuse me.

These offices are locked...

but I need to talk to Senator Avery
so that I can speakwith him.

The old boys usually go
to the Forum Club around now...

up on Capitol Drive,
butyou'll need to wear a dress.

Yeah, I figured.
Hey, thanks.

No public servant
can take money for favors.

Doyou smell mothballs?
I thought it was the dress.

Hey, Elly May.

Senator, sir?

Remember me, please?

Well, now.

I'm used to a little
scratching on the doghouse...

before sharing the bowl here.

No, thankyou.
I'm not thirsty.

Miss, I didn't askyou to sit down.
And I didn't hearyou ask me.

Sorry, sir.
Can I sit down, sir?

Sir...

I was on Red Rafferty's boat
last weekend.

Is that a fact?
Yes, sir, it's a fact.

And it was stupid too.

Oh, I see.

It was a stupid fact, huh?

Well, then...

Iet me try and teach you
about facts.

Especially around this place.

It's a fact that in my district
we lose one farm every single month.

Now that's one entire
family enterprise.

And doyou know what that does
to me personally?

It just breaks my heart.

When I was a young boy,
my pop--

The clown.

Anyway...

he lost his farm.

It just ripped my guts out.

Now that's why I support
this corporate vertical farming.

Now, it's an unpopular idea...

butyou have to wearyour unpopularity
as a badge ofhonor, don'tyou?

I thinkyou do, don'tyou?
Now, look.

You see those fellows
over there-- sitting over there?

They have no badge ofhonor.

Those are the gutless wonders
from across the aisle.

They preach hypocrisy
and not democracy.

That, too, is a fact.

Don't you remember?

Me and Red almost got
into an alteration...

and you said that he should be more
gentlemanlike 'cause I'd tear him apart.

Which is right, since I know
I could've kicked his ass.

And also, I'm a girl.

Awoman.

A woman. Oh, yes, you are indeed.

Very, very much indeed.

But I'm just flat-out sorry, miss.
I don't recall.

There were just so many people
on that boat.

Oh, no, sir. There weren't.
There was...

one, two, three...

four, five, six, seven.

And then six, five...

because number two had to drive the
little boat for number one which is me.

So, back on the big boat
there was five again.

Because he's still number two
on my fingers.

I seem to be missing the point.

Senator, sir...

it's time to swallow
the bullet.

I know about the tape.

The tape.

You know about the tape.

What tape?

Areyou referring to
the mother of all tapes?

People still go 'round
and 'round about that.

I've stated on the record that Nixon's
only crime was getting caught.

He'll still go down as
the most effective modern president.

And he was a hell of a trapper.
Oh, boy.

Although most people think otherwise.

Did you ever hear about...

this little luscious
Hong Kong tour guide?

He kept her hid
at Bebe Rebozo's foryears.

I'm sorry. Poop.

This isn't whatyou came to talk
about, is it, American history?

No, sir.

I want to talk about the tape.
Oh, yeah, the tape.

Well-- Areyou sure
you're speaking to the right person?

Senator, I respect thatyou're
a big wheel in a small pond...

and I wouldn't botheryou
otherwise.

But, sir, you are the right one.

I'm running for my eighth term.

Last elected by the largest plurality
ever in my district.

I'm currently on nine legislative
and culture committees.

Oh, I believe in culture.
I really do.

But just not too much culture.

Because too much culture just breeds
a kind ofarrogance.

Eisenhower.

You know Eisenhower?

Well, he and that fashion model...

that was just embarrassing.

His wife knew.

He should have stuckwith
the double-breasted WAC...

with her own built-in foxhole.

I find you very attractive.

Don't askwhy.
It's just freshness.

You're unspoiled.

I'm 52.

Divorced.

And a pretty fairjudge ofwomen.

I would sayyou're
the genuine article, aren'tyou?

Why areyou getting so nervous?
I don't bite.

Sir, this is my first case
and I'm still green behind the ears.

But...

one person has already
been beaten up good...

and another is scared
ofthe same thing, only better.

Pretty soon somebody
could get killed here...

and die!

Die?

Who the hell areyou?

And what in God's name
areyou talking about?

My name is Trixie Zurbo.
I'm a private defective.

You mean detective?

Detective.

And I'm giving 1 00% to this case.

And what I got left, I'm giving
to help people out oftrouble...

because ofthe tape.

Now, I know it can't be the bad singing
tape, so it's gotta be another one.

And I'm asking you sinceyour name
has come up and been mentioned...

yours and Red's...

and the DeFlore brothers
and their fists.

I need answers, sir.

Otherwise, it'd be like looking through
a needle for a haystack, you know?

Sir...

why is this tape worth
so much money from you?

Does it involve the land deal
and those luxury pandemoniums?

Is money the root canal
of all the evil here?

Those are pretty serious
allegations, young lady.

Slimy too.

There's a big, empty grave out there...

where all the falsely accused
politicians lie.

You just ask Newt.

And ifthis Red Rafferty
is abusing my good name...

I'll have him punished.

And whateveryour involvement
is in this...

the same goes foryou.

You may be hearing that tape on TV.

And then everybody
will know about it.

It's very easy to throw grenades...

but it's very, very hard
to catch them.

Sir, the ball is in your camp.

So, now, what is it?
Blackmail?

Is that what this is,
is blackmail?

Well, I suppose
that comes with life...

in the old fishbowl.

Areyou married?
No, sir.

Why areyou asking me that?

Oh, it's just that
a woman's...

sexual temperature is...

never lost on me.

Gals maybe, huh?

Threesomes?

Team creams?

Senator, I know life can't be easy
for people likeyou in a bowl offish.

But I am not gonna sit back
on my hunches about this.

I see.

Well, I am going to say one thing
and one thing only.

So listen carefully
and hearwhat I am saying.

I am one ofthe few--
one ofthe very few...

who will admit
that all politicians...

are guilty ofsome misdemeanors.

It's just inherent in the office.

But we are sworn by oath...

never to go beyond the bounds
of reasonable dishonesty.

What kind oflame duck is that?

Doyou hearyourselftalking
when you speak?

You hear this.

Nobody can influence me.

Not power mongers
with short penises.

Nobody! Nobody at all!

And a woman?

Even less.

Now leave my table,
immediately.

Can I have Dawn Sloane's room?

That line's busy.
It's busy?

It can't be busy!
Well, it is.

Okay, okay, bye.

Hey, easy.

But that machine took my money
in return. And no gum.

The service guy don't get here till 9:00
and we can't refund. Station policy.

It's only 7:30.

You wanna hear a good joke?
Knock, knock.

Come in.

Is that it?

Where's the laboratory?

The lavatory?
It's inside around the corner.

It's ten bucks.

Listen to this. It's great.
Knock, knock.

Who's that?
No, it's "who's there?"

Can I help you?

She's registered as Dorothy Slotnick
ofCrescents Cove.

Wristwatch stopped at 7:30.

Must've been when she jumped,
orwas pushed.

Gravity is a bitch.

She called her a lymphomaniac,
which I thought was rather crass.

She told me to get her a black pot
of coffee. So I did that.

When I came to the door, she gave me
five bucks to watch her room.

She sounded like
a five-year-old child.

There's no Mr. Lang
in our hospital.

He's checked out?

He couldn't walk on his legs
to check out.

He wasn't discharged.
He'sjust gone.

He's escaped?

But seriously, ifyou're
driving tonight, please--

Don't forget your car.

You took the words right out
of my mouth. Good night.

Just keep bringing me these
until I can't pronounce my name.

She was dressed like a nun
with a sexy habit.

A habit that would make a bishop put
his fist through a stained glass window.

What's with the getup?
I'm in a cognito.

And I need to talk to Dex.

Safer to swim with piranha.

Ask Dawn Sloane. Poor messed-up kid.
Finally got the front page.

Tell me ifyou've seen her.

Not for days.
Areyou okay?

Something's wrong.
It's bad wrong.

Pushing a lady six floors
has rarely been considered virtuous.

Dex didn't do it!
I know he didn't do it.

Ifyou have thoughts you can think of,
I've moved to the Motel Embers Motel.

Trixie, old Arabian proverb:

Trust in Allah,
but tieyour camel.

Thanks. I don't smoke.

How did you find out
where I lived?

Where's Dex?
I don't know.

Where is he?
He's not here.

Hey, babe.

Mommywants you back
in the bedroom.

Can you do that?

What else doyou
want to know, Miss Dick?

Who the father is?

Maybe it's Dex.

Maybe not.

No, you don't know
a thing about Dex...

or me or about that bitch Dawn.

You're no better than any of us,
not even Kirk.

Your little pal's an ex-con.

He murdered somebody once.

In cold blood.

But I fucked him anyways.
'Cause who cares?

Why don'tyou go home
and chaseyour shadow for a while?

You're never gonna catch that man.

You're wrong.

Even ifl am between a rock
and the deep blue sea...

I am gonna fix this thing.

It's Dex.

You escaped?

They made herjump.
They pushed her.

Doyou have a gun?

Yeah. So?

So I'm gonna blow
their pinheads off.

Not with that.

Oh, I'll do it.
Don't worry.

You should know that about me.

Along with the other shit.

There's no bullets. How can you shoot
somebodywithout any bullets?

I don't care.
It's brains, not bullets anyway.

What's that?

For the ticker.

Without these little babies,
it'd be "Good-bye, cruel world."

And now my parents are coming.
My clues!

Wanna take me back.

Can you believe that? Backwhere?
To the rich life we used to lead?

Sorry. Too old for that.

I'm glad you're here.

I'm glad you're okay.

Areyou okay?

Why are we doing this?
Why not?

We don't want him to see us.
Why not?

Because then he'll see us.

Good.

Red, you in there?

Did you maybe run or something?
How far doyou wanna take this?

Come on.
How far doyou wanna go?

Come on. Listen.

Dawn told me she hid the tape in
a secret place and didn't tell anybody.

Areyou one ofthe people
she didn't tell?

I know a little bit
about Dawn's secret place.

Take me there.

Wake up.

Go to sleep.

Go on stage.

Make love.

Clues.

Assholes!

Get inside. You missed!

Assholes!

You shot my brother.

You shot my brother.

Stop there right whereyou are
on your tracks.

I hate hospitals.

You have some nerve, young lady.
That was not our boy.

Joe, please.

It's all right. We remember Charlie
as healthy and happy-go-lucky.

That wasn't Charlie.
Here's Dr. Gold.

Mr. and Mrs. Lang.

I'm sureyou're aware
your son's condition...

is compounded by his enlarged heart.

We drove 500 miles last night
becauseyou tell us our boy is here...

and then you show us that.

He's conscious. Vital signs are
stabilizing. Bullet went through him.

But it's early. Your HMO won't cover
his preexisting conditions.

God, I hate hospitals.
Your secondary carrier is?

I want him out ofhere!

Well, I'll go to Admitting.

Get a few forms.
Just a mere clerical thing.

We gotta stop meeting like this.

Get me out ofhere.
You can't leave.

You got more tubes than
you can shake a cat at.

Did you see my folks out there?

Not so rich, huh?

They got something
better than money.

Better than me.

I gotta go.

You gotta go all the way now.

We can't do it here now, can we?

What?

You halfin love with meyet?

Let's jump offthat bridge
when we come to it, okay?

The other half's better.

You can't be in a patient's room.
Areyou a patient?

She's with me.
I'm leaving.

Well, you're certainly
feeling much better.

I don't understand this.

I thought that we had
talked about this before.

I want my money, Red!

I've tried to teach you
about patience.

I don't believe this!

I thought I'd been good
toyou guys.

You don't know what
real work is because--

Is this whatyou want?

Take it easy. Take it easy.

Come on and kill me,
you stupid sons ofbitches! Please!

Kill me!
I don't even care!

Oh, God!

Listen, fellas.

I'm sorry.

Sons ofbitches!

Oh, God.

You?

What areyou doing here?

Oh, I see.

All right. I rememberyou.

Is this the wayyou want it?

What is wrong with you?

You killed Dawn Sloane, didn'tyou?

Areyou kidding me?

How dareyou.

I don't have time foryou.
Goddamn it! Leave me alone.

Did you push heryourself
orwatch your pin cushions do it?

I loved Dawn!

Okay, maybe it wasn't love.
But it was something.

What areyou doing?
What doyou want from me?

She's dead now.
She's never gonna be the same again.

Nobody everwanted anybody
the way I wanted Dawn.

Oh, God, it's bad now.

Everything is bad now.

It's a bad world we live in.

You did it.

Butyou're gonna make
a 1 00-degree turn and confess.

Confess to what?

I loved her!

The very best I knew how.

Why doesn't anybody understand
these things? They take time.

I even told mywife about her,
for God's sake!

That doesn't mean you didn't do it.
I didn't kill Dawn.

You think I'd be lying now?
I came up here to join her. This is it.

Hang on.

Don't let go. Notyet.

Wait a minute.
I'm not readyyet.

Listen. She knew it was just business.

I don't use women like that.
Just this once.

All right, well, maybe
just that one other time.

I swear, I'm not like Avery.
I never killed anybody.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Wait. Where areyou going?
Listen.

Just give me a hand here.
Wait a minute.

I'm not safeyet.
I loved her.

I loved her!

Goddamn it! I loved her!

That's why I'm tellin'ya

I'm gonna getyou

Andgetyou, getyou

Shut up, Dawn.

Something inyour loving

Makes everything all right

Wow.

How do you sing Acapulco like that?

Good foryou.

Keep our humor going
during these dark moments.

What's the matter?

I just wanna get going.

All in good time.

You can take myword
on matters of patience.

You do trust me, don'tyou?

I assume that means yes.

Yeah. I mean, you can use
your own discrepancy on that.

All right.
What aren'tyou saying?

Did you really go to jail?

Oh, I see.

Soyou wanna get going
away from me.

No.
That's whatyou're thinking.

I don't have to believe
what I think.

Seven years, minimum time.

Astoundingly good behavior.

Best reviews of my life.

Better than when I opened
forTrini Lopez.

Butyou killed somebody dead.

Murder.
I didn't murder anyone.

I did, however,
slaughter a man...

in my own defense.

I am not by nature...

an offensive person.

I know.

I meantyou no harm, Miss Trix.

Lucy, you can't be in the show.

Oh, why, Ricky?

Just turn the big old lights
on little old me and let me loose.

Like a real star.

Right?

Yeah. You look like a star.

Dress like that tomorrow.
In full regatta.

It's me.

Areyou all right?

Does the pain really hurt?

My old man hates hospitals
as much as much as I do.

I'm going homewith them,
try and get healed.

You're going home?

Soyou're okaythen?

Can you comewith me?

Averywould just make out
like a banshee then.

I got a good plan. Honest.

I can't go back to square zero.
Oh, shit.

Maybeyou still need a doctor.

No, I need something else.

Please don't ask me to quit.
Please don't.

I'm proud ofyou.
Quiet girl bucking the odds.

Except I can't helpyou now.

You did help me.

Did I?
Yeah.

Not like I could on a good day.

Look at them.

Standing there in spite
of everything.

Can't buy that, can you?

See, I'm rich after all.
You too.

So bet big for both of us.

The less you bet
the more you lose when you win.

I know that.

I will.

We got a long way to go, son.

Got a long way to go.

Beatrice.

Good-bye.

It's just for now, though, okay?

It's not the real good-bye.

What's real, Beatrice?

I got to pee-pee real bad.
Not in my caryou're not.

Oh, easy foryou to say.

It hurts.

I hate stakeouts.

What ifhe didn't do it?

What areyou talking about?
Of course he did it.

Besides, he's guilty ofso much shit,
whatever comes to him he deserves.

You know what they say about lies.

A lie gets halfway around the world
before truth can get its pants on.

There he is. That's him.

Where?

You didn't tell me he was cute.

Knuckleheads.

Ifwe win, we win.

Ifwe lose,
we spare ourselves untold agony.

Leave it here, will you?
How's thatyoung wife?

Fine, sir.

Takeyourjacket off.
What aboutyours?

I'm saving mine for later.

Hey, Al, ifyou wanna
avoid a train wreck on this thing...

call us in to conference.

Ifyou don't, when I get a chance
to wreck that train, I'll wreck it.

Bullshit.

When you get tired
ofbeing stupid, we'll talk.

Walk in halfmoons.
Halfmoons.

Keepyour shoulders back
and sparkle, peanut.

Good. Own it.

And pose. You look great.

Own it.

Okay, dazzle them.

We stole it fair and square, Bob.

Al's really spooked.

He's got a cob up his ass.

There he is.

Hello.

I wouldn't piss down
his throat...

ifhis heart was on fire.

I gotta pee-pee really bad. Would you
order me a peach daiquiri, frozen?

Honey, where's the ladies' lounge?

-Just around the corner, miss.
Thankyou.

Could I have a peach potpourri?

I'll try.

Tell the guys we did a good job.

I'll do that, Drummond.

Don't make me hurtyou.

Let go!

Come back here! Shit!

Mister, you okay?

Damn it!

Watch the language
you use around me!

Doyou know whatyou're messing with?
Get in the trunk in back.

Come on.
Don'tyou know the score?

Yeah, two-zip to me. Do it.
Very cute.

I'll lose my damn job.

I'll tell you what else.
I'm not paying for this car.

I'm a government employee.
I work for a state senator.

What's up?

Can I have the bag, please?

Give me the fuckin' bag!

Okay, bend your legs and knees,
all ofyou, over there.

Wait. Get naked
out ofyour clothes.

What?
Do it. Naked. Take them off.

Kiss your lips to the ground.

Do it!

Now sayyou're sorry.
Sorry.

Where have you been?
Don't even ask.

You're out ofbreath.

Okay, let's do it.

Now?
Yeah.

I mean, snowmobiling
is a very big business.

Now, we've put together this pamphlet
thatyou can look at in your own time.

Mother Nature is sometimes
a neglectful mother...

as it were, and doesn't always
provide for her children.

And it's snowmobiles
that help create the tracks--

This table is reserved
for senators.

Senator Avery, sir?

Theyoung lady can join us,
ifyou would like.

How kind.
You're lovely. Thankyou.

Well, come on over.
You people don't mind?

No, not at all.
That's fine.

There we go.
-James, get my coat.

There we are.

I'm Ruby.
What's your name?

Drummond.

Senator Drummond.

They love it.
The tracks make tracks for nature.

What wereyou saying?
Wild animals love snowmobiling.

The truth about snowmobiling.

You folks seem just
ready for a slam dunk.

Can't just let nature run wild,
can we, young lady?

Yes, well, that's really
quite something.

I hadn't thought ofit that way.

It's-- You know--

Well, you know,
some of my colleagues...

theywould toss you to the alligators
just to watch them peel that...

whole salami.

I'm sorry. It gets hotter than high
school love in some ofthese sessions.

You know, even
Rough RiderTeddy, he had--

he had a condom named after him.

Oh, I tell you...

sometimes after a session
all you can do--

all you can really say is...

"Wham, bam, thankyou, ma'am."

You're welcome.

We realize it's gonna take
a concentrated effort.

We're so glad that
you're on board with us, Senator.

Another round, Senator?

Yes. Round and firm.

Silly me. I completely forgot to
give them my I D at the bar.

You don't have to do that.

Sixteen?

Let me see that. I'll handle this.
Very good, sir.

I suppose I probably
shouldn't have any drinks then.

Who the hell areyou?

Well, it seems like this young lady
is trying to get me...

to leave the table
with my head between my knees.

Verywell, Senator.
We'll be in touch with your office.

This is a devastating situation
ifyou're on the wrong side.

Senator Avery, Mr. Ladies Man.

Where's the videotape?

Wouldn'tyou like to know?

You're blackmailing me,
you little whore!

Lady, what are you doi ng?
Leave the stereo alone.

Put your hands down.
Shut up, comprende?

I want my money, Avery!

After whatyou made me do,
I want plenty!

I'm not sure I know what this is.

I'm throwingyou out the goddamn window
ifyou don't give me that tape!

That would make you
a murderer, Senator.

No two-dollar whore
is gonna ruin my career, slut!

Thanks.

What have we got here?
You.

You are disgusting!
A disgusting pig!

You're a rotten mackerel!

Disgusting!
Shut up! Get her out ofhere!

Help me! He's insane!
She's underage! Get her out!

What's on that recording?

Seems like somebody's
trying to convince--

Not out the front. Out the back.
He's the killer!

He's the killer!
He's the fuckin' killer!

He killed Dawn Sloane the singer.

Senator, what areyou listening to?

So this is that tape.

You did it. Get her!

Get her! There she is!

Oh, shit.

What's the matterwith you,
huh, boy?

Get out of myway!

That's it! I quit.

Get out of myway!

Senator, can you tell us
what's going on?

Sure I can tell you what's going on.

Certain people are only at peace when
they're causing war on other people.

They come out here with airs
up theiryou-know-whats...

and they have no respect whatsoever
for the finest climate under the sun.

Excuse me, folks.

But, Senator--
Now, wait. Wait.

Now you folks put 'em on the news and
they claim the climate's ruined them.

I would be ashamed
to haveyourjob.

You're two-faced.

Senator,just one question--
just one question about the tape.

Doyou wanna make a statement
about what just happened?

What's your position on it?

The truth is...

in terms of size and shape...

and direction...

we're all normal men.

And one word sums up...

the responsibility of each of us.

And that one word is...

"to be prepared."

Everybody out!

Come on. Let's go.
Clear it out.

Move!

Clear it out, people.

nothing was ever achieved
by perfect people...

because you can't find 'em anywhere!

For Christ's sake, FDRwas poking
his secretary for 30 years!

And what happened?
Did the world fall apart? No.

Did the bottom drop out? No.
Nothing happened.

Nothing changed.

But the critics, those little
demented bastard bag ladies...

they keep digging it up.

They are the ones that would be
enormously improved by death.

Maybe we should hang 'em all.

Your comments are a little vague.
What exactly areyou admitting to, sir?

After my pop died--

Well, you folks know that story.
I've told it toyou before.

But I was raised by my grandmother
and some of my aunts.

And they shaped my life.

They convinced me,
as a young boy...

that there was always
a cookie available.

And even today, deep down,
I'm that little four-year-old.

And when I wake up, the first thought
I have is, "Where's the cookie?"

And that means...

when you go to the cupboard...

and there's no cookie...

I don't say,
"Geez, there's no cookie."

I say...

" I wonderwhere the cookie is."

Ifyou people are gonna
tear down monuments...

at least save the pedestals.

Because they come in
very handy later on.

You know, I feel like
I've been raped byyou people.

I think this rape's
just gone on long enough.

Eddie, get 'em offthe street.
News hour's over.

Oh,Jesus.

Let's clear the area.
There'll be no more questions.

Isn't life just a big bag
oftricks these days?

Go ahead. I'm ready.

You sure?

I'm ready.

All right.
Maybe it's the beginning.

Or maybe it's the end.

I don't know.

Let's do it.
Come on.

Pull that thing.

Come on. Pull it.
For me!

Senator?

It's brains, not bullets.

Vote for the Sadomasochistic Party!

Vote for the Get Ahead and Die Party!

Come here.

I had that weasel in the palm of my hand
and you just threw it out the window.

I don't understand. I had to crawl
down a fire escape to get here.

I've got bruises covering
mywhole entire body.

How could you concoct a plan
and muck up the entire thing?

You should probably take up
a deskjob.

What?

Where did you get that earring?

The store.

Where's the other one?

I'm losing my earrings
all the time. I don't know.

You should be a lot more concerned
about Avery than my goddamn earrings.

It's you, isn't it?

You just ruined another life...

Miss Dick.

This time, your own.

Did you push her?

How could you not even
think aboutyour baby?

How dareyou mention my baby!

How dareyou mention him!

You don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything!

You killed her now!

You're going down, baby!
The killer is you now!

The killer's over there!
She did it!

The killer's right there!

It's her! She's in disguise
in the white coat!

Hold that woman!

I booked Ruby Pearli on a foot chase.
Then I saw a female, kind oftall.

Excuse me, sir.

There she is. That's her.

Who areyou and
what doyou know about this?

Look, the crutch ofthe matter is...

you get that earring
from Ruby Pearli's ear.

Ruby Pearli, right.

Match it to the same one
you found at the crime scenery...

maybe even test iffor D and A...

and you'll have clues
coming out ofthe wormwood.

The wormwood?

Ruby Pearli killed Dawn Sloane...

because she was jealous
over Dex and his love.

Dex who?

I might know how she feels...

but I would never show it
that way.

It wouldn't be love anymore...

not the way that I wanna love.

Lady, what the hell
are you talking about?

I'm telling you the truth...

the whole and the truth...

and nothing but the truth.
