<i>Shut up,

<i>Control your Noise, Todd.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>Think of something else,
think of something different.</i>

<i>Think of birds.</i>
AARON: <i>Dust you are...</i>

Preacher.

AARON: To dust
you will return.

<i>Why is the preacher here?</i>

<i>We don't even need a preacher.</i>

<i>Nobody goes to church anymore.</i>

<i>Boy sinned.
Judgment.</i>

<i>Shit, he heard me.</i>

(HORSE CHUFFS)

<i>Don't run.
Oh, he's hearing that, too.</i>

<i>Just hide your Noise,

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>Stop looking
at my thoughts.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt,
I am Todd Hewitt, I am Todd...</i>

(BOTH GRUNT)

<i>Don't show weakness.</i>

I know your truth.

An orphan, runt.
Unwanted. Weak.

Like a woman.

<i>Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't know.</i>

<i>Never seen a real woman
before, they're all gone.</i>

<i>They're all gone. All gone.
Wouldn't know.</i>

<i>Never before. Never seen

<i>You were no help.</i>

Come on.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN: <i>I gotta pee.</i>
(CHATTER THROUGH NOISE)

TODD: <i>Back from a hunt.</i>

<i>Here comes Davy, useless.</i>

(CHATTER THROUGH NOISE)

Shit-shoveler Hewitt
and his dumb dog.

<i>Thinks he's a man,
but he's never killed a thing.</i>

Better watch your Noise.
<i>Snake.</i>

(CLICKS TONGUE) You cocky
little son of a bitch.

<i>Snake!</i> (GRUNTS)
(HISSING)

(HORSE WHINNIES)


DAVY: <i>Don't let him see
that it hurts.</i>

<i>I can hear everything
you're thinking,</i>

<i>you dumb shit.</i>
DAVY: <i>Beat his ass.</i>

<i>Shit, the mayor,
the mayor,</i>

<i>the mayor, the mayor. Shit.</i>

<i>Hide your Noise,
hide your Noise.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

Is there a problem, boys?

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

No, Pa.

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

Very clever use
of your Noise, son.

<i>Mayor likes me.
Thinks I'm a man.</i>

PRENTISS:
I reckon you'll be riding

with the Spackle Patrol
before long.

Very clever.

Maybe my son can learn
something from you, Todd.

Davy?
Yes, Pa.

Keep shovelin' that shit.

<i>Shit-shoveler Hewitt.</i>

<i>Asshole.</i>

TODD: <i>I wish they'd let me
ride past the ridge.</i>

<i>Stuck here,
there's nowhere else to go.</i>

You get lost, son?
There's work to be done.

Usually when you get lost.

I was out getting that part
you asked for.

<i>Beets. Always beets.
I hate beets.</i>

<i>It turns my shit red.</i>

<i>Manchee, here.</i>
(WHINES)

<i>Dog doesn't even want it.</i>

How was your day, son?

Uh, yeah, good. Busy.

PRENTISS: <i>That snake was very
clever use of your Noise, son.</i>

<i>I reckon you'll be riding</i>

<i>with the Spackle Patrol
before long.</i>

<i>My son can learn
something from you, Todd.</i>

<i>Very clever, very clever.</i>

Mayor is not
your friend, son.

<i>At least the mayor
thinks I'm a man.</i>

<i>Thinks I'm smart.</i>

Then maybe the mayor
can raise you, too, huh?

Put clothes on your back,
food in your plate.

<i>Shit, here we go again.</i>

Stop it, you two!

(CILLIAN AND TODD ARGUING
THROUGH NOISE)

BEN: Stop it.
Stop it, you two, please.

Control your Noise.

I need you on the field
with me tomorrow, all right?

Yes, sir.

A gift for your birthday.

Thank you, sir.

<i>I always wanted a knife.
Like a man.</i>

PRENTISS:
We're all that's left.

We have to protect
each other.

To do that,

it's important you learn
how to tame things, Todd.

YOUNG TODD: Tame?

Break them. Control them.

YOUNG TODD: By

killing them?
That's right.

Here, men must kill.

<i>You're the youngest here,
Todd.</i>

<i>You'd be
the last man standing.</i>

<i>I'm the circle,
the circle is me and you.</i>

<i>See, I wasn't born
into the Noise like you.</i>

<i>I had to learn
how to control mine</i>

<i>through years of practice.</i>

(GRUNTS, SIGHS) Go to sleep.

TODD: Okay.

PRENTISS: <i>I've had my eye
on you, Todd.</i>

<i>You're exceptional,</i>

<i>and exceptional men are needed
to hold the circle together.</i>

<i>To do that,
it's important you learn</i>

<i>how to tame things, Todd.</i>

That son of a bitch
has his claws in.

PRENTISS: <i>I've had
my eye on you, Todd.</i>

(BEN SIGHS)

<i>Exceptional men
are needed in the circle.</i>

MOTHER BIRD: (ON SPEAKERS)
<i>Scout ship A, prepare to enter</i>

<i>New World's atmosphere</i>

<i>in T minus 37 seconds.</i>

CAPTAIN: (ON SPEAKERS)
<i>Copy that, Mother Bird.</i>

<i>Still no contact
from the surface.</i>

<i>We'll let you know
what we find.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>the temperature
at point of entry</i>

<i>will be a balmy 3,000 degrees.</i>

<i>Please make sure your
seat backs and tray tables</i>

<i>are in their full
upright position.</i>

<i>Buckle up.</i>

WOMAN: Think the settlers
are still alive down there?

NOAH: If they are,
they're gonna be happy to see us.

They were expecting
the Second Wave years ago.


CAPTAIN: <i>Don't freak out,
don't freak out,</i>

NOAH: What did we
just fly through?

CAPTAIN: <i>Don't freak out.</i>

NOAH: <i>We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.</i>

What did you say?

I didn't say anything.

<i>She heard that? I'm so scared!</i>

CAPTAIN: <i>Fire! Get out!</i>
NOAH: <i>Fire!</i>

Captain!
NOAH: <i>Fire!</i>

<i>Oh, my God. We're gonna die.</i>

CILLIAN:
<i>Behind on the planting.</i>


TODD: <i>I'm the last boy
in the world.</i>

<i>Someday,
I'll be the only one left.</i>

<i>I'll just be all alone.</i>

<i>I wonder if you can actually
die from boredom.</i>

<i>I hate beets, it's always
beets farming every day.</i>

Todd.

<i>One day,
you'll be alone.</i>

CILLIAN: Todd!

What? (PANTS)

CILLIAN: Check the panels,

Sure.


CILLIAN: Go!

<i>Holy shit.</i>

What the hell?

<i>Is that...
Is that from the sky?</i>

<i>Is that a spaceship?</i>

<i>A spaceship?</i>

<i>Where'd it come from?</i>

<i>It's not from here.</i>

<i>From the sky.</i>

Hello?

<i>Somebody was flying it.
The thief.</i>

<i>The thief. Survivors.
Survivors?</i>

<i>That's a...
That's a spaceship.</i>

<i>A spaceship.</i>

<i>The hell did it come from?
Where'd it come from?</i>

<i>Graves. People. Dead.
Buried. Death.</i>

<i>I gotta go tell the mayor.</i>

(MANCHEE BARKING)
<i>This is exciting. Spaceship.</i>

<i>Spaceship. Mayor's gotta know.
Gotta hurry.</i>

AARON: <i>Judgment.
Judgment is coming.</i>

<i>Never seen
a spaceship before.</i>

<i>Think it's from Earth?
How'd it get here?</i>

<i>Spaceship crashed.
Spaceship. Spaceship.</i>

<i>Shut up, Todd.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

DAVY: <i>What's the rush?
Gotta tell mayor.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>What, you think
I can't hear your Noise?</i>

What're you babbling about?

Nothing.
DAVY: Where you goin'?

Hey, come back here!
<i>Control your Noise.</i>

<i>Control your Noise.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Here comes that boy.
Gotta tell the mayor.</i>

<i>Shut up, Todd. Shut up.</i>
Hey.

<i>Hide your Noise.</i>
Hey.

<i>Hide your Noise.</i>

<i>Spaceship. Shut up.</i>
(VOICES OVERLAPPING)

<i>What're you talking about?</i>

What do they want?</i>

MAN 5: <i>Where's the ship?</i>

(VOICES CLAMORING)

TODD: <i>Spaceship crashed.</i>

MAN 7: <i>Is this
the Second Wave?</i>

<i>Tell the mayor.
Gotta tell the mayor. Go.</i>

Mayor, I found somethin'.

(VOICES OVERLAPPING)

<i>You should've
told me first.</i>

There's a survivor.


He'd been stealing
from our farm.

I followed him here.
Here, look!

Gotta be from Earth, right?

Very good, son.

Search it,
anything we can use.

<i>The mayor likes me.</i>

<i>Likes me better than his boy.</i>
PRENTISS: Todd.

<i>Shut up, Todd.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

The survivor,
what did he look like?

He was too fast,
I couldn't see his face.

MAN 1: What did he say?

I don't know
how he was doing it.

But he didn't have any Noise.

MAN 2:
Preacher never been wrong.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

DAVY: <i>No Noise?
You gotta be kidding me.</i>

MAN 3: <i>I know what that means.
No soul.</i>

PRENTISS: Find her.
DAVY: <i>I'll find her, Pa.</i>

MAN 4: Get her!
TODD: <i>"Her"?</i>

<i>Wait. What? "Her," "find her"?</i>

<i>Holy shit! It's a girl.</i>

<i>Space girl.</i>

<i>He's a girl.</i>

<i>Never seen a girl before.</i>

<i>From the farm.</i>


<i>Whoa!</i>

Stop! Don't come any closer!

<i>Girl. Girl. It's a girl.
Girl. Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Where are you from?
You're a girl.</i>

<i>No Noise. Are you from Earth?
Girl! Thief! Shut up, Todd.</i>

I'm sorry. I've just never...

<i>Never seen a girl before.
Breathe.</i>

Are you from Earth?

<i>You're really pretty.
Yellow hair. Found her.</i>

I found her!</i>

Wait, wait, wait!
(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>Shit! Stupid Noise.</i>

MAN 1: She's running!
MAN 2: Got you now!

<i>Go! Go!</i>

MAN 2: Get her!

MAN 1: <i>Look at you.</i>

(URGING HORSE)

MAN 2: Get the girl.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

MAN 1: Bring her back.


TOWNSMEN: (CHANTING)
<i>"I am the circle,</i>

<i>"the circle is me.</i>

<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me.</i>

<i>"I am the circle,

<i>"I am the circle,

It's all right.
It's all right.


<i>We got her.</i>


You're safe now.

I'm David Prentiss,
I'm the mayor here.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

MAN 1: <i>Second Wave.</i>
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

<i>I think it's the Second Wave.</i>
MAN 2: <i>This is bad. Bad.</i>

(INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES)

DAVY: <i>She looks funny.</i>

PRENTISS: Quiet.
Sit down.

That was a terrible crash.

And you are
the only survivor, miss?

You're lucky
to be alive.


Were you hurt?

(VIOLA SNIFFLES)

I saw the graves.

I'm sorry.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER
THROUGH NOISE)

That must be overwhelming.

(WHISPERS) It's loud.
Mmm.

We call it the Noise.

Happened to all the men
when we landed on this planet.

Every thought in our heads
on display.

It's fairly harmless,
though.

Some of us can control it
better than others.

<i>Can control it.</i>

<i>She's one of us.</i>

<i>Control.</i>

Can you see mine?

No.

Didn't affect the women.

Where are all the women?

They're dead.

There was a war.

A terrible war,
against the native species.

The Spackle.

They overran our colony
and they killed all the women.

Slaughtered them.

Can you tell me
how you came to be here?

You will have
to actually speak.

The Noise didn't affect
the women, remember?

Can't hear your thoughts.

I was scouting.

So you come
from a larger ship?

Yeah.

We lost contact with
the First Wave colonies,

so we were sent out to scout.
Ah.

And this ship will be
coming for you, right?

How big is it?

It's the largest
in our fleet.

Holds 4,000 people.

And it will be landing where?

Why?

(MUFFLED COMMOTION)

Excuse me, for a moment.

Don't talk to her
and don't let anyone in.

<i>"I am the circle</i>

TOWNSMEN:
<i>"and the circle is me."</i>

MAN: <i>Is it Second Wave?</i>

ALL: <i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

MAN 2: <i>What does she know?</i>

<i>What's going on
in there? Is she okay?</i>

TOWNSMEN:
<i>"... and the circle is me.</i>

<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

<i>"I am the circle."</i>

PRENTISS: <i>Don't talk to her
and don't let anyone in.</i>

DAVY: <i>Pa said
don't talk to her.</i>

<i>Pa is not here.</i>

Looks like it's just
you and me now, little sis.

<i>Never seen a girl before.</i>

<i>Girls are scary.</i>

Hey!

<i>Can't trust girls.</i>

<i>What is this shit?</i>

VIOLA: Be careful with that.
(DAVY SCOFFS)

<i>I do what I wanna do,
what I want.</i>

(POWERING UP)

(ALL CLAMORING)

PRENTISS: <i>Davy!</i>

(CLAMORING CONTINUES)

MAN: What kinda crazy thing
she got in there?

Where is she?

DAWS: She must've
gone out the back.

Find her.

DAVY: <i>Oh, shit.</i>

<i>Cannot trust girls.
Sorry, Pa.</i>

AARON: <i>An angel
descended from the heavens</i>

<i>to bring forth judgment. Yes.</i>

PRENTISS: Preacher.

AARON: David.

<i>Judgment.</i>

PRENTISS: I'm done living in exile.
If we take her ship,

we can take control
of the planet.

They'll be in hypersleep
when they land,

so they won't expect
an ambush.

We just can't let her
warn them about us.

AARON: <i>The angel is here
to punish us. And so much...</i>

PRENTISS: She's not an angel,
she's a girl.

She's all alone
and she's got nothing.

AARON: <i>Martyr.
Truth demands a martyr.</i>

<i>Judgment, judgment.</i>

DAWS: <i>Get her back to the
mayor, she can't be far.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Go,
she can't be too far!</i>

MAN 2:
<i>She has to be found again.</i>

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

MAN 2: <i>Girl's about
to find out what's what.</i>

TODD: <i>Why is she so important?</i>


<i>The hell happened in here?</i>

<i>I hope she's okay.</i>

<i>Space bag.</i>

<i>Someone's gotta take it,
might as well be me.</i>

<i>Take it.</i>

<i>I bet she has
some cool shit in here.</i>

The angel moves swiftly.
TODD: <i>Space bag.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>


BEN: Oh, there he is.

Todd! Come over here, son!

Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!

(MANCHEE WHINES)

<i>Mmm. At least it's not beets.</i>

Hey, Manchee.
(MANCHEE WHINING)

(FAINT WHIMPERING)

<i>Oh, my God. Girl! She's here.
Yellow hair. Shit.</i>

<i>Uh, what the hell?
Space girl. Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Girl! Be a man, be a man.</i>

<i>Be strong. No Noise.</i>

<i>No Noise. Girl.</i>

What're you doin' here?

<i>Why are you here? Yellow hair.
You can't be here.</i>

<i>Scary. She's scared.
Don't be scared.</i>

<i>Thief.
Should I turn her in?</i>

BEN: Todd!
I'm coming, Pa! Hey.

<i>Help her.</i>

You gotta stay here,
they're all looking for you.

Don't come out.
Manchee, come on.

<i>Control your Noise.
Think of something different.</i>

<i>Chores. My chores.
Gotta do my chores.</i>

<i>I love my chores.</i>

Hey.

Where have you been, son?
Nowhere.

<i>I've gotta do my chores.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

Yeah, I'mma...
I'mma do my chores.

<i>I love my chores.
But you don't gotta tell 'em.</i>

<i>You gotta tell them, Todd.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>
BEN: Tell us what?

It's nothing,
don't worry about it.

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>
(HORSE WHINNIES)

<i>You gotta tell 'em.</i>

<i>Shit. Yellow hair.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

BEN: Hey, Daws.
What can we do for you?

We're looking
for that space girl,

maybe she came through here?

Space girl?
What're you talking about?

Ah. Her ship crashed down
in the woods.

Todd here found her.

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

DAWS: She dropped her jacket

not too far
from your property,

so I was thinkin' maybe...

Maybe she came through here.

Nah, nobody come through here.

She... She ain't easy
to spot. She...

She don't got no Noise.

She didn't
come through here.

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt. I'm...</i>

Anyhow, I'll just take
a look around.

No, no, no. Maybe not.

You heard the boy.
Get on outta here.

I'll be seeing you.

The girl's in the barn,
isn't she?

BEN: <i>Trouble, trouble.</i>

Hey, there.

Yeah, she don't speak.

<i>Space girl.</i>

<i>Oh, shit!</i>

BEN: It's all right,
it's okay.

It's okay.
TODD: <i>I know, she's real.</i>

<i>Shut up, Todd.</i>

BEN: Just...

Wait here, all right?

Wait here.


I'm not gonna give her back
to the mayor, Cillian.

I can't do that.

<i>I like her hair.
It's pretty.</i>

She can't go back there.

We... Please, Ben, we have to help her.
Come on.

She can't stay in the barn.

Prentiss will find her.

We have to give her back.

(SIGHS)
We don't need that trouble.

No, but that's not
what she wants, Cillian.

<i>I'm not gonna give her back.</i>

Cillian.

This is the chance.

Would you guys
quit lookin' at each other

and somebody talk to me?

Todd, if you want
to help the girl,

you have to go.

Go where?
There's nowhere else out here.

BEN: There is.

There is somewhere else.

(BEN SIGHS)

Farbranch.
TODD: Farbranch?

Others went over.
A long time ago, Ben.

They never came back.
They'll kill him in Farbranch.

Not if he is with her.

What about the mayor?

BEN: Forget about the mayor.

If you want
to protect the girl,

you have to leave now.

TODD: It's a long way.

When can I come back?

<i>They lied to me.
They lied to me.</i>

<i>They lied to me.</i>

Stay with the girl
at all times, okay?

And don't let it on
you're from here.

Why?

Just don't mention
Prentisstown.

What does that mean?

What do you mean
don't mention this town?

Just don't...
Don't mention you're from here.

Son, you gotta go.

I'm proud of you.
Your mom would be, too.

<i>My mom.</i>

KARYSSA:
<i>â™ª Early one morning â™ª</i>

I'm gonna go get the

Afternoon, Cillian.

CILLIAN: <i>Son of a bitch.</i>

Ben.

We're here for the girl,
Cillian.

CILLIAN: I know.

And I told your man,
she ain't here.

PRENTISS: You won't mind if
we look around a little, then?


BEN: I think you and your men
should leave.

(CILLIAN GRUNTING
THROUGH NOISE)

PRENTISS: (LAUGHS)
What is this?

You know,
we got a girl on the loose

and all you can think about
is chopping wood.

What's wrong with him?

Come on, son.

You don't have to hide

Just tell me where she is.

But you have fish

I've never been to Earth.

You were born on the ship?

So, you're not from Earth?

It took 64 years

I mean, you don't look
64 years old.

Please ignore that.

My grandparents
were from there.

Things started

so they signed up

64 years.
So they must have left

before the First Wave

Why'd you come
all this way

if you didn't know
exactly what was here?

Why does anyone
look for a new place to live?

They hoped things
would be better here.

born on the ship, too?

Are they still up there?

We should go.

It's just strange to see

it's strange for me, too,

not knowing what's

We couldn't do anything, son.

We tried.

But it was chaos.

The best we could do
was keep you safe.

How could you keep this
from me?

No. No.
My whole life you lied to me.

No, we thought
we could protect you.

That's not protecting me,

that's lying to me.
I'm sorry.

Let me protect you now.

Let me go in there
and get the girl.

I can get her out.

Hey.
