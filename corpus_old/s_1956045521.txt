Hey, boys-

Sorry.

I came into this world
out of luck...

and we all know
a man needs luck.

Becoming a sheriff was the first
good thing to come my way-

a pretty laid-back job just outside
of Colby University in North Carolina...

the university being the primary
money tree and academic playground...

for the offspring
of the rich and powerful.

Nothing that required
any real police work.

Mostly frat parties, noise complaints
and an occasional DUl.

At least that's the way it was until
I got that call from Dean Comyn.

We've had a little trouble
with one of our students here.

Overdose.

Isn't that a medical problem?
Her mother feels it's criminal.

I'm sure you can understand
our position here.

This thing does
have to be investigated.

Sensitively.

Delicately.
Right.

Like old Sheriff Perkins
would have done.

I'm sure that when the time comes
for the town council...

to name a permanent replacement...

I'll be able to report what a fine job
you have done as acting sheriff...

for us.

You goddamned rich girls.
You think you own the world.

'Cause whenever you mess up,
your daddy just writes a check.

We didn't do anything to your daughter.
It was an accident, Mrs. Campbell.

You think I don't know what happened?
You think I don't know what you did?

All right. That's enough.

This bitch tried to kill my daughter.
She's lying in the hospital.

She can't talk. She can't move.
She can't even open her little eyes.

Alicia's her only child, so-

But she's acting like it's our fault.
She was our friend.

You don't know how sorry we are.

Okay, well-

Why don't y'all just tell me...

what happened.

We were having a party...

and Alicia was drinking.

She was so loaded.
She wanted to get high.

Oops.

It's all right.
I ain't going to bust y'all.

I just want to know
what went down.

Like I was saying,
she wanted to do some coke.

And...

I remember hearing someone
downstairs making a lot of noise.

She was jonesing, and she thought there
was stuff hidden in the guest room.

She was tearing the room apart.

She couldn't find any, sol left.

What time was this?

A little before 2:00.

Okay. Go on.

The party had broken up, and Hads
and I were upstairs cleaning up.

She went to bed, and I went
downstairs to get something to eat.

And I heard this- this crash.
When?

I don't know. 2:15, maybe.

And I went into the bathroom
and I found her, and-

I yelled up to Hadley
to call student health.

And I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth
and I tried to revive her, but-

I just- I couldn't.

Why didn't you call 911?

We thought it would be-
Because student health is...

down the street from our house,
and they have a doctor on call 24 hours.

So we thought that she would
be able to get help faster.

Okay. Well, I guess I just need
to take a look at the scene.

Multicolored paper.
I've seen this before.

Y'all didn't touch anything
in here, did you?

Move anything around?
No.

What's in there?

The library-
Alicia's room.

She kind of moved in on us.

All right.
I guess I'll call y'all...

if I need anything else.

All right.

I'm sorry.
We don't allow flowers in ICU.

Lead, follow or get out of the way.

These eight words will be the focus
of our last semester together...

and how they affect behavior patterns
in the modern American society...

not only macrocosmically
in the so-called real world...

but in the microcosm of the
classroom and the university.

Field-research projects
on the topic...

will comprise 80 percent
of your grade.

Projects to be presented orally
the last week of class.

Orally?

Personally,
I do not like to swallow.

I know. It totally wears
the enamel off my teeth.

I learned this new dribbling technique
where you let it spill out the sides.

I'm sorry. Can you please be quiet?
Excuse me?

Some of us are trying to learn.
You will work in pairs.

Pairs?
But Professor, if the topic is...

lead, follow or get out of the way,
shouldn't we work in teams of three?

I'll pair you up myself, thank you.

I'm on my way out of town.
Why don't we talk about this in class.

Hadley, I really think-

I'll do my half, you do yours,
then we'll meet towards the end.

But we have actual places
that we need to visit together.

And if our data doesn't corroborate-
We'll deal with it.

Who's that?
Attention, Kmart shoppers.

That's the chick
Hadley got stuck with.

Cute.

Hadley, please.
We really need to talk about this.

No, we don't.
But, I-

Airport.
Yes, ma'am.

I'm interested, Hadley.
You think you've earned this job?

I don't know.
Well, at least you're honest.

You think I oughta give you this job?

Yeah. You're my father.

What's that supposed to mean?

I'm not running
a general store in Kansas here.

This job has nothing to do with
getting high and listening to music.

Come on.

Come on, Daddy.

It's time you showed initiative,
accomplished something on your own.

Get your grades up.
Then we'll talk about this job.

Want me to get A's, I'll get them.
Want me to kiss your ass, I'll-

I don't have to hire you.
And to be quite honest with you...

I think you'd be better off
if I didn't.

But what else would I do?

Why are you here?
I wanted to see her.

See her or be seen?

Alicia's my friend.
Don't make me laugh.

I'm the one who called for help.
You're the one that gave her drugs.

You're crazy.

If I ever see you near her again,
I will kill you. You understand?

Hi, Alicia.
Come on in.

So, you think you have
what it takes to be a lawyer?

Yes, ma'am.
Well...

I have to admit,
your grades are very impressive.

Thank you.
How nice of you to say.

I see you've been in the work-study
program since your freshman year.

Yes, ma'am.
How you managing?

I just try and work hard.
Your parents help you out?

Well, my father's
not around, so-

It's been tough for my mom,
being a single mother and all.

Tell me about it.
You're a single mother?

I'm divorced.
It's tough on the kids.

It's been really difficult for us.

Hey, sweetie.

It's okay.
There's nothing to cry about.

I'm sorry.
Well,Alicia...

I don't see a reason this application
shouldn't pass with flying colors.

Thank you.

As far as that
financial aid goes...

money is real tight
for us right now.

Tell you what.

I'll look into it.
Let me see if there's anything I can do.

God. I grovelled in front of that lady
for something I completely deserve.

She made me feel like an alien.
It's okay to bomb a little.

Oh, my God.
There he is.

Hi, Trevor.

Hi.
Hi,Trevor.

Who the hell is that?
She's nice.

What's up, crazy?

Warren, put the camera down
and come here.

Where you going, baby?
Come on.

Hey, Alicia.
Hi.

I know we got off on the wrong foot.
Amongst other body parts.

But I really need to maintain
my average.

And I need to get an A.

Then let's try to forget this extraneous
stuff and try to work together.

I don't know if my sociology
is going to go with your sociology.

Well,we can try.

Okay, but no holier than thou...

no snotty remarks
and no whiny â€œBut, Hadley. â€œ

That's enough for today.

Hey.
You're-

You're pretty good.

I have my moments.

You want to talk about Alicia?

Well?

They must not give you
a lot to do around here.

I'm trying to figure out how Alicia
went from being a total stranger...

to being your best friend...

to now lying in a hospital bed
with tubes running in and out of her.

She fucking OD'd.
Had nothing to do with being my friend.

We got stuck together
on this sociology project.

She kept hounding me.

I kept blowing her off, and suddenly
she was outside the door at the party.

So I decided to invite her in.

Is this a joke?

We wouldn't have let you up
here if this were a joke.

Oh, no. Too â€œwhite girl. â€œ
Put it on her.

Very nice.

She cleans up real nice.

Nice job.

Lead, follow
or get out of the way.

All right.
what about the drugs?

None for me, thanks.
But you go right ahead.

I was talking about Alicia.

Well, in the beginning,
Alicia wasn't even into drugs.

I'll drive.
No, let Hadley drive.

Not that any of us were either.

But, you know.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

He was sick before he got in the car.
Uh-huh. Get in.

Guys, my stepfather told me...

if I get a job, he'll give me
$10,000 to spend however I want.

What's the point of getting a job if
he's going to give you the money anyway?

To learn the value of money.
Oh, please!

Tell me that you see
the irony in this.

You don't have to do anything.
just tell me you see it.

It's not like he's buying me a car.
You guys are so lucky.

Why?
Because you're free.

Aren't you?
It takes money to be free.

Speaking of which-
Relax. It's here.

I know I have it.
Isn't this the turnoff to Max's?

Wait. Max Tamer?

Private moment.
It's in my panties.

Your panties?
Wait. The drug dealer?

You saving tips from the titty bar?
I thought it would be safe.

You know what?
I'd like to get out of the car.

Sid, your panties are hardly
the Fort Knox of the undergarment world.

Oh, and you should talk.
Do you even wear panties?

Today.

Hi.
Hello.

Don't worry.
You're not doing anything illegal.

I'm not?
No. You're just the lookout.

Hadley, if I get caught,
I'm gonna get kicked out of school.

I'll lose my scholarship.
No law school-

Relax. This is college.

So if she wasn't into drugs,
then how did she OD?

I think maybe she tried
to kill herself.

In the microcosm
of the classroom and university.

Field-research projects on the topic
will comprise 80 percent of your grade.

Oh, this looks like fun.
Be nice. They're children.

Lead, follow
or get out of the way.

A sociological examination...

of poor kids placed
in a privileged educational environment.

What cartoons do you guys watch?
Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.

Really?
Fox Family.

Do you guys watch the news?
No.

What are we going to do now?
I Spy.

What do you want to look at?

This?What?
No. This.

Hey, how come you're not
eating with the other kids?

They're stupid.

Dc-I look like him now?

They think they're so cool
'cause they have those boxes.

I like your lunch box.
Look at that.

I don't know.
I think yours is much cooler.

Let's see.
What do we have in here? Aha.

Look at that.
Wow.

Now you can get any kind of
lunch box you want.

But it's our secret, okay?

Have fun picking out your box.
Okay.

Bye-bye.

Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you.

Thank you for coming.
We'll see you again.

Okay.
Bye. That was really nice of you.

Yeah, I'm really great
with drunks and kids.

Instant gratification, you know?

I'll see you tonight.

Have a good day.

Hey, Artie.
Hey, Joanie-

Where you been hidin'?

Can you give me
some background information...

on some of the students
that attend Colby?

Didn't anybody ever explain to you
the way things work in this town?

Which derives 80% of its jobs and 90%
of its revenue from this university.

Where, on occasion, the police are
asked to conduct a discreet inquiry...

they don't disrupt students' lives,
privacy, interrupt their studies...

or, as a matter of fact,
talk to them at all...

except at mutually agreed-upon
convenient times...

until it can be conclusively proven
that a crime has been committed.

Which you haven't,
you can't, you won't.

Why do you always have to be
the center of attention?

Drunk. Butterfly.

Let's just hang out.

Do butterflies drink?

Let's just bail
on Josh's tonight, okay?

How come?

'Cause I don't want to sit around
and get wasted and stupid.

Oh, okay, Captain America.

Are your parents coming down
for your scrimmage on Saturday?

'Course.
What's their deal anyway?

They come down for everything.

They do.
That's what parents do.

Oh, so that's what parents do, huh?

I have to tell you something.

What?

Oh, man,
you're gonna be so pissed.

What?

I got accepted into an international law
program at the University of Minnesota.

You can't be serious.

Sorry, honey. I can't do it.

Daddy, I've been working hard.
I've been getting my grades up.

My friend Alicia's been
helping me out with all the-

I'm really sorry, honey.
I'll make it up to you.

Daddy, phase.
We?! talk later. I got to go.

I was just going
to drop off my notes.

Happy birthday.
Thanks.

What's that smell?

Lunch.
You're cooking?

Yeah, but don't shatter
your image of me too quickly.

I only do it for my father,
so he can get that nice...

homey feeling
before he stands me up.

Let's celebrate.

Oh, yeah, baby.

Yeah. Shake it!

You are such a freak.

What's this?

It says â€œHadley?
Open it.

Okay.

Watch the drink.

â€œRound trip to Rangoon. â€œ

Fucking Sidney.
What does it mean?

It means we're tripping.

But I just held it for a second.

It absorbs through your skin.

But I just held it for one second.

Do I look funny to you?

Come on. just go with it.
It's okay.

I can go with it.
Okay.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

This is never, ever,
ever going to be over.

And I have nothing.

It's going to be over.
I promise.

And until it is,
I'll be right here.

Promise me that you're never, ever,
ever going to leave me.

I'm right here, okay?
Now I want you to think happy thoughts.

Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.

You're not gonna die. I'm here with you,
and I won't let anything happen.

You're gonna die too.
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna die.

No one's going to die.

Hey, Sarah.
How you doin'?

I've been better.

Now, Alicia-
She's your best friend, right?

Was.

We basically started to drift.

Everything was fine until she got the
news her financial aid was turned down.

Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
Hi, stranger. How you doin'?

Alicia upstairs?
Yeah, she's up there.

I went to see her that day,
and she totally had a meltdown.

After that day,
we barely saw each other.

She was too busy reinventing herself
with her new rich friends.

What do you think it means?
What did you do to her?

Alicia!
Hey!

So, I guess you forgot about Sunday?
Sunday-

The movie?
Oh, God. I forgot. I'm so sorry.

Do you even want
to be friends anymore?

What are you talking about?
We've been friends since kindergarten.

You don't act like it.
We barely see each other.

All you do
is hang out with them.

It's just you don't know them,
and it's hard.

You never invite me.
Because you wouldn't like it.

Oh, right.
I see.

I guess it's because I don't do
the right amount of heroin...

or sleep with my professors
or get enough abortions, right?

Is that what they're saying
about us this week?

I can't believe you.
You've totally changed.

No, I haven't changed.
I'm just really happy.

What about me?

So, are you coming?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

Listen, don't ruin this
for me, okay?

I know what I'm doing.
This is a great opportunity.

Trust me.

That's when she really
stopped being my friend.

Right side! Cover it!

Excuse me, Trevor.
I need to ask you a few questions.

You're prelaw, right?
Like Alicia?

Yeah.

I'm just a little curious
about y'all's relationship.

We're friends.
She's cool.

Is that how she felt?

Meaning?

Meaning is it possible that she could
have thought a little bit more of you?

Just a little bit.

Alicia liked to have a good time.

We liked to hang out.

Nothing wrong with that, is there?

I wasn't trying to ignore you. You've
just been so busy playing hostess.

I'm surprised you even noticed.

You and Alicia seem to be
getting along very well.

You act like I don't even exist,
flirt with every breathing guy.

And I dance with one girl,
a friend of yours.

I'm not the bad guy here. Okay?

I'm not the one who's drooling
all over Little Miss Muffett.

Well, if that's what it takes
to get your attention.

Don't turn this around on me.
Turn what around?

You know what?

Do whatever you want.
Go fuck her for all I care.

I tried explaining to her that
we were just having a little fun.

I mean, it's nothing
to get weird about.

Alicia was new to the gang,
and she wanted to fit in.

I helped her whenever I could.

All the best girls in town

Every time I see you
you have a little frown

Go Warren, Warren, Warren
Warren, you scorin'

With all the chickies

I see that big thing
is a hickey on your neck

When I stare at you
you're laughin' at me

You're laughing at me
that's okay because I'm free

Some call me
the trick-a-dick daddy

What's wrong?

Nothin'.

Warren Z's on, he's on the mike
tryin' to ride my bike

God. MC Hammer!
MC Hammer, MC Hammer

That's me
because I'm so â€œhammerinâ€

I'm glad I found you, 'cause...

I'm feeling
kind of out of place tonight.

Really?

Me too.
Yeah?

Yeah.

You really love Hadley,
don't you?

Yeah.

I suddenly feel like
I shouldn't be here anymore.

Why?
Oh, come on, Trevor.

I think you fit in just fine.

Good spit.
I think you're really great.

So that's as far as it went?
That's as far as it ever went.

Well, then why is Alicia
lyin' in a hospital bed?

Sometimes bad things happen
to good people.

So the bartender says,
â€œWe got a drink named after you. â€

And the grasshopper says,
â€œWhat, you got a drink named Steve?â€œ

Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
Can I have what she's having?

Trevor is so, so smart.
Yeah, he's perfect.

Are you okay?
He thinks I'm a drunk.

He's totally crazy about you.

Yeah, for a person
with a severe drinking problem.

You're a smart, beautiful girl
who really doesn't believe in herself.

Why should I?
My dad doesn't. Trevor doesn't.

I do.

I know you like him.

Well, everybody likes Trevor.

I know that you think we're all wild
and everything and that everything goes.

But we don't fuck
each other's boyfriends. Okay?

Look, Hadley.
I've never been in this place before.

Now, all of a sudden, all these guys
are dancing with me who a month ago...

never knew I existed.

I owe all this to you. I would never do
anything to jeopardize our friendship.

Okay?

Come here.
Gimme a hug.

Come on.
Come and dance and have fun.

Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come and dance.

Sorry it took so long.

All right. All right.
Basic party mix.

20% coke; 80% milk, sugar,
baking soda, talcum powder...

and assorted
powdery-white crapola.

Nothing out of the ordinary?
Not in the least.

Except...

that's not what she took.

When they wheeled her in, she still
had some crusted on her nostrils.

They took a swab of that.

Pharmaceutical quality.
100% pure.

All right. Thanks, Dex.

What the fuck is your problem?
You want credit, call a loan officer.

Hold on. Hold on.
Hold, please!

Yeah. Yeah.

We got some Colombian,
Jamaican, Thai...

northern lights with a
skunk-five hybrid, hash, hash oil.

Think about that for one minute.
Hold, please.

It's not mine.
I need to ask you some questions.

Multicolored paper, Max.
I like to brighten up people's lives.

Did you brighten up
Alicia Campbell's life?

I don't know anything about-
Who gave her pharmaceutical cocaine?

What are you talking about?
Come on now, Max.

That shit was 100% pure.

If she didn't get it from a drug dealer,
then who the fuck did she get it from?

Ask anybody. I sell a very low-quality
product at a very premium price.

All right. Now you get to spend some
quality time with some premium people.

Lead, follow or get out of the way.

I'll be back later.
Alicia, honey.

Don't you have to study?

What's the point?

Hey, it's Hadley.

Leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

Hey, Chief.
Something I can do for you?

I have to ask you a few questions, but
could I use your bathroom first, please?

Sure.

Why don't you use the bathroom
at the top of the stairs.

I'll be right down.
just give me a minute.

You can't do that.
What are you looking for, anyway?

Alicia overdosed on
pharmaceutical cocaine.

I need to know where it came from.

I think you better go.
Can I talk to you for a few minutes?

Don't you need to get
a warrant or something?

Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Where would we even get that shit?

That's what I'm saying. I don't know.
And I do?

You think that Alicia's just this
innocent little virgin we corrupted.

She's nothing like she seems.

Believe me, that girl
was full of surprises.

Is-
Hadley's not here. Okay.

She and] Jules went to get stuff for
the party, but you can hang out with me.

Okay.

Come sit.

Oh, my God.
You're watching Fame.

I totally think that all America needs
is, like, this giant Fame resurgence-

How many guys have you slept with?
What?

How many guys
have you slept with?

Well- One.

I mean, sort of.
Well, half of one.

Because when we actually did it...

his thing only went in that far.

And afterwards, Sarah said,
â€œYou're a technical virgin. â€œ

Why? How many guys
have you slept with?

Forty-two.
Are you serious?

Daddy number two crawled in
one night when I was ten.

Not the ideal way to lose your
virginity, but, hey, shit happens.

He molested you?
Yeah, well, poor me.

Guess that's why
I'm so fucked up. Right?

My dad did that to me too.

But I think-

Well, I know that you're
a smart and beautiful girl.

See, that wasn't so bad.
Was it?

Take off your pants.

So, then, you two were a thing?

Well, that's what I thought. But little
miss pisshead had plans of her own.

Trevor, give me a hand
with this, will you?

They're gonna
be here soon. Hurry.

I am.
Oh,Jesus Christ!

Oh, heart attack.

We were supposed
to work today, remember?

But if now's not a good time,
then I can come back later.

No, no, no. Stay.
Hang out for a while.

Okay.

Alicia looks pretty hot tonight.
Why don't you go dance with her?

So you can slink over
and start dyking it up with her?

I already have.

What?

When?

Right now.
You bad girl.

Jesus. What,
is everyone a lesbian now?

Oh, back for more.

Can you control your girlfriend?

The party's over here.

This should be good.

I thought we had a deal, Alicia.
I was just having fun.

A little too much fun.
We're going back to school tomorrow.

It's not due until May.
We don't have to do it tomorrow.

Besides, I'm gonna be
completely hung over.

If I blew something off every time I was
hung over, I'd still be in third grade.

Hadley, you just have to, like...

just calm down.

I am calm.
It's just-

What?
It's not cool, okay?

If you want to stay up
all night partying, fine.

But you're getting crazy.
You're not balancing.

Don't touch me.

Sid, hey, don't touch me.

Fuck you.

Listen, I'm not into
this thing with us.

Oh, really?
You could've fooled me.

Why don't you go find Trevor?

I'm sure he's missed having to
fight you off the last five minutes.

Just leave me alone, okay?

So you were upset.

Why would I be upset?

I don't know. You tell me.
Tell you what?

About you and Alicia.

You would never understand.

Why? 'Cause I'm a cop?

Because you're a guy.

This is how you're
leaving my students alone?

By sexually harassing them?
What?

I know all about your
little panty raid at the girls' house.

Goddamn it!
I did not touch those girls.

Possibly I didn't
make it clear to you...

how things work around here.

You made it clear,
but I am investigating a crime.

An accident.

Slipping somebody pharmaceutical
cocaine and attempted murder-

those are not accidents, sir.

Maybe it's time that
I asked the town council...

to start interviewing other candidates
for the position of sheriff.

How you doin', Joanie?
Hey.

All right.

I appreciate this.
Anytime.

You think I'm a freak?

I did that...

for five years.

Until all these white bumps...

grew all over my face and body.

And when you're ready,
I can help you stop.

No one can help me.

Every time I do it,
I think it's gonna be the last.

It never is.

I'm just a big fat loser.

Fat.

You're beautiful,
and you're smart.

And your dad...

probably said you were fat...

just like mine did.

I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

The stuff Alicia was doing
you can only get with a prescription.

And my father just happens
to be a pharmacist.

Hey, Dad, we're having
a coke party tonight...

and I really wanna fry
one of my friends.

Really, Pop?
You're the best.

You think Alicia's the Virgin Mary.
She's a fuckin' liar.

We were getting tired
of keeping track of her.

You won't believe what just happened.
Want to celebrate?

I don't know.
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

It seems like an awful lot.
Max's shit...

you have to do a whole gram
in each nostril to even get a buzz.

We are celebrating here,
aren't we?

We most certainly are.

Here she goes.

Hello. Oh, yeah,
she's right here. Hold on.

Alicia, here.
Hello?

Hi! How are you?
I'm fine. Okay.

No. Oh, my God.
I am so beyond excited.

Yes! Totally excited.

Thank you so much.
All right.

I'll see you later.
Bye.

Hey, what's up, Alicia?

Then she took off again.

So you don't know who it was
or what it was about?

Just that it was a guy.

Didn't sound like anyone I knew.

But after she talked to him,
she disappeared for a few days.

That last night, she shows up
at our party totally wasted.

Hey, you guys.
Look.

What a tart.

I'm going to help Hads.

Hold this.

Oh, shit.

I don't know.
You think we should tell Jules?

Not until we got something to tell.

Let's go.

She's not worth it.
How am I gonna have fun with her here?

Hey!

Oh, Mes. guess what we 'just-

She is so unbelievable.

I knew she-
Whatever.

Alicia, I'm not really
comfortable with this.

Here, let me make it
easy on you.

Hadley slept
with Warren, you know.

Really?
Yeah.

All your bullshit about Alicia and me,
and you fucked Warren?

Come on. Let's talk
about this alone, okay?

No, not if you were
the last person on earth.

Should've told him.

Where's Alicia?

All that time, we thought
it was Trevor she was after...

but apparently
she had her eye on Warren.

And you forgave her for that?

No. As a matter of fact,
I didn't.

Well, you realize that's a motive.

Really?

Then why didn't I try to kill Hadley?
She fucked him too.

I mean, if I went after
every girl Warren fucked...

you'd have a campus
littered with dead bodies.

You usually get a lot
of college kids in here?

Are you kidding?
The way these kids drink...

I'm making a fortune
just off the fucking tips.

But we ca rd everybody.
They got to have two pieces of I.D.

I don't serve underage in here.

Did you hear what happened
to Alicia Campbell?

Yeah. She was in here
a couple of nights before it happened.

I threw her out. She and this blond
chick were having a pier six brawl.

Blond chick? She's about 5'6â€œ,
splint on her arm?

Yeah, that sounds about right.

Do you know why they were fighting?
It sounded like a guy.

Take it outside!
Outside!

You don't remember what
they were fighting about?

You remember hearing any names?
Warren? Trevor?

No. I told you,
just some guy.

All right.

All people are affected by
their external circumstances...

and one uses the gifts
one is given...

to bargain and negotiate
for a place in society.

Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?

Was that okay, Warren?

Was that okay?

To blend in and follow.

Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?

Should I do that again?
This ain't really your style, is it?

You go to school,
and every once in a while...

they actually want you
to hand something in.

â€œLead, Follow,
or Get Out of the Way:

A Sociological Examination
of Poor Children...

Placed in a Privileged
Educational Environment...

and Rich Kids Thrust
into the Deprived Students' World. â€œ

After an initial period
of rebellion...

the poor student discovers his success
in the rich kids' environment...

comes from his ability
to blend in, to follow.

The old man
who lived in the old house...

he jumped on his house
and knocked it down.

But what about the rest of the children,
the ones caught in the middle?

Like the middle class
they will grow up to be...

they simply don't want
to get involved.

They don't want to be bothered.

They're simply content
to get out of the way.

I said it.

Okay. Okay, I get it.

So Alicia is
the poor kid, right...

who was allowed to hang out,
play with rich kids.

They didn't want her to lead.
She didn't want to follow.

So someone had to get her
out of the way.

You need a vacation.

So how'd it feel, Warren, huh?

Fucking Hadley- was it worth
all the problems that it caused?

Are you kidding?
It let me fulfill a fantasy.

Hadley got the best boning
of her life. Sid got to watch.

Where does Alicia fit into all this?
She didn't...

other than telling Jules
and Trevor about it.

Why did Alicia tell...

if Sidney was the one
who saw it?

If I gave a shit and was willing to
think about it, I'd say it's because...

Alicia had more to gain.

You're really fucking paranoid.

I'm paranoid?

You're a smart and beautiful girl
who really doesn't believe in herself

Hi, honey. I'm really sorry
about your birthday...

but I'm having a meeting
in Atlanta tomorrow.

I could come down early
and meet you for dinner tonight.

Say, 7:30,
the Lawrence ville Inn.

Bye-bye.

Message deleted.

Hi. Mr. Ashton?
Yes.

I'm Alicia Campbell,
a friend of Hadley's.

I'm so glad you could join us.
Where is Hadley?

She's not coming.

She's finishing up an interview
for our soc project, sir.

But I didn't give her your message.
Excuse me?

The discipline you've enforced
on her is working so well, sir.

And because she's studying and she's
working hard and not drinking so much-

and I know it's not my place to get
involved, but if she saw you now...

she would just lose
complete focus.

Really.

Are you sure?
I am, sir.

Have a seat.

Would you like a cocktail
or a glass of wine?

I'll have...

a club soda.

Club soda.
I'll have another one.

You know, you really might be
a good influence on her.

You really might be
a good influence on her.

Multicolored paper.

You really might be
a good influence on her.

Pressure!

It's falling. We're losing her.
Please get out of here.

Come on, come on.
You have to leave. Let's go.

We got a flat line!
Asystolic!

Code blue!

We were able to stabilize her, and we'll
continue to watch her through the night.

There's not much more we can do
right now, Mrs. Campbell.

You should go home
and get some rest.

I'm sure you can understand
our position here.

This thing does have
to be investigated.

Sensitively.

Delicately.

You think that Alicia's just this
little innocent virgin we corrupted.

She's nothing like she seems.

You think Alicia's the Virgin Mary.
She's a fucking liar.

When they wheeled her in, she still
had some crusted on her nostrils.

They took a swab of that.

Pharmaceutical quality.
100% pure.

I'm just trying to figure out how Alicia
went from being a total stranger...

to being your best friend...

to now lying in the hospital
with tubes running in and out of her.

Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

Sometimes
you gotta do what's right...

'cause you can't not.

It may cost me my job, but there's
no way Alicia knew what she was taking.

Come on now, man.
Do the right thing.

All I know is there was some pretty
weird shit in the air that night.

Hadley and I weren't getting along,
and I was sick of getting wasted.

Nice spit to the beat box.
Nice spit to the beat box.

I'm feeling really
out of place here tonight.

I know.

Me too.

I had a lot of fun
dancing with you.

You just gotta be careful.
What do you mean?

You just have to be careful
and watch out.

Stay sweet.

See, Hadley didn't like it
if she wasn't the center of attention.

Hey, Hadley.
You're not walking so good.

Hey, Trevor.

Watch this.
Where you goin'?

What are you doing?
You're a nut.

Miss Hadley.

Where are you going?
Hadley!

You've had a very severe
concussion.

We'll have to keep you
to run some tests.

No, I'm not staying here.

Yes, you are.

If there's anything I can do
for you while you're here...

give a holler.
Is everything okay?

That's all I know.

All right. Look alive.
I'm gonna need this from you-

an inventory from the hospital.

Give me the name of the orderly that
was on duty the day Hadley was there.

Petey, I'm gonna need
a lab test, search warrant.

Thank you for joining us
in this candlelight vigil...

in honor of our close friend...

and fellow student...

Alicia Campbell.

As you all know,
Alicia had a setback last night...

and needs
our hopes and prayers.

Please take a moment
to ask for her recovery...

so she can once again
return to us here at Colby.

Hi, Artie.
Good to see you.

Hey, Rhoda...

were you on call
the night Hadley was admitted?

No, but I was there
the next day when Alicia came.

You working on the soc project?

God, when did you get so anal?

When you started slacking off.

I just have a lot on my plate.

Right. Drinking like a fish, doing
drugs, going through people's drawers.

Daddy!

I heard you finally found
something harder than your head.

How's my little girl?
Good.

Really?

Hi. Nice to see you.
It's nice to see you again.

There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

Let me walk you out.
Okay.

Bye, Hadley.

Bye, Alicia.

Girls and their dads.

All right.
Thank you, Rhoda.

Sure.

May 26.

Graduation day
at Colby University-

the awarding
of an academic degree.

Today, 345 students
will be advancing.

One will not.

While the one left behind
lies in a hospital bed alone...

her friends and colleagues
celebrate with their loved ones.

They came to Colby
as young, unformed minds...

in search of truth
and knowledge.

As they leave,
the real world awaits...

filled with hopes, dreams...

opportunity and me.

Sorry, y'all.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

All right.
There they go right there.

Excuse me, y'all.
I'm sorry.

Excuse me. Watch out, y'all.
Comin' through.

I'm sorry to interrupt.
Hadley Ashton, you're under arrest.

I will not have you
harassing my students.

They stopped being your students
12 minutes ago. Please come with me.

You have the right to remain silent.
Excuse me, y'all. Sorry.

Dad?
Right behind you.

I kept looking
at that splint on your arm.

Trevor told me about your fall.

You were in the hospital, Hadley.
The day nurse remembers Alicia's visit.

Let me walk you out.
Okay.

Bye, Hadley.

I've been thinking about
what we talked about the other day.

I'd really like to help you.
Really?

Yes. How'd you like
to come work for me?

Gosh.

Well, what I really want to do
is go to law school.

Really?
Where have you applied?

Baxter, Yale, Penn.

Well, I can't help you there,
but I am on the board at Stanford.

Really?
Yeah, that's great...

but it won't help me
with the financial aid.

_ 50-
Wait a minute.

You can clerk in our legal department
during the summers...

and in exchange,
we'll pay your tuition.

How's that?
Oh, my God.

Are you serious?
Yeah.

Thank you so much.
It's okay.

It's just my way
of saying thank you...

for you keeping an eye
on my daughter.

And when you graduate...

we get first shot at you.

Thank you.
Sure.

You're giving her a job?

A total fucking stranger!

You're doing everything for her,
but you won't hire me...

your own flesh and blood,
your own fucking daughter!

This has nothing to do with you.
She's a lying fucking...

manipulating, two-faced bitch!
Hadley, stop it!

There's a motive, Hadley.

Alicia went after
everything you had...

everything you valued.

It's about my daughter.

It was your father on the phone
with Alicia that day.

You pick up this phone
and you tell her it was a mistake.

I'm not gonna give somebody something
and then take it away from them.

I'm not gonna go back on my word.
No! You tell her!

Calm down.
No. It's over.

Tell her.

Hello?
Can I speak with Alicia, please?

Alicia.
Yeah.

Hello?
Hi. How are you?

Remember what
we talked about earlier?

Hadley would like
to congratulate you.

Wouldn't you, Hadley?

Hey, Alicia.
Congratulations.

Oh, my God!
I am so beyond excited.

Thank you so much.

What's up, Alicia?

We'll keep you here for a while.

If there's anything I can do
for you, just give a holler.

See, Trevor saw the orderly
hit on you.

He was easy, wasn't? he?
Did you get it?

I could lose my job for this.
It'll be worth it.

The night you left the hospital,
you called Alicia...

and met her
at the Cilver Bullet.

The whole bar saw you.

Everybody heard you.
Don't walk away from me!

Nobody uses me to get to my father.
I'm not!

You're supposed to be my friend.
I am your friend.

No! You no longer exist.
Hadley! Hadley, don't leave me!

You wanted her out of your life,
but you knew she'd show up at the party.

I heard her with her dad,
and I saw her with this vial...

Sidney finally told the truth.
but I didn't know what it was.

She heard you call your father.
She saw you put the coke in Max's paper.

Daddy, come by for breakfast
before you go to the airport.

Call me and let me know.
Bye.

Just you, me and your little
strung-out protege.

Have you seen my lighter?
No.

Hurry up.
Go get dressed.

Whatever your intent, you put
the coke where you knew she'd find it.

April Fools', bitch.

I heard this crash.

Julianne tried to save her.
And I found her.

Alicia's OD'd!
Call 911! Hurry!

And I called out to Hadley
to call student health...

and I tried to give her
mouth-to-mouth...

and I tried to revive her, but-
Two! Hadley, where are they?

Why didn't you call 911?

We thought that-

Because student health
is right down the street...

and they have a doctor
on call 24 hours.

Why aren't they here yet?

She'll be fine.
She won't come to.

Where's the phone?

Oh, shit.

Fuck!

You did it all?
Oh, my God.

You were smart enough
to switch the packets...

It's your basic party mix.
But you forgot...

and left the real one in your robe.
That's not what she took.

I'm gonna call 91 I.
No, I already called student health.

If you call 911,
it'll get the police involved.

Lawrence ville emergency.

We can't just wait for them.
She could die!

Keep doing the CPR.

91 I recorded your call at 2:23.

The call to student health
was six minutes later.

Whether you intended
to kill her or not...

you created the circumstances
that put someone at risk.

Once my father realizes
you're not perfect-

What's the matter?
Are you jealous?

You're really fucking paranoid.

I'm paranoid?
That's really funny.

Meaning?
No, you know what?

I really don't wanna hear
your twisted little take on my life.

Don't ever condescend
to me again.

Student health?

I am not your little windup doll,
like Sid or Julianne.

Oh, my God.
We've had a horrible accident.

Why don't you go away?

You want me to leave?

You're nothing but
a poor little rich girl...

who never got enough love
from her father.

Never thinking a significant thought,
just pretty enough to get by...

by screwing around
on her fucking boyfriend.

You know what?
I'll forgive you for that...

because I assume that
you just don't know any better...

because you come from
trailer park trash.

Or is it the booze talking?

But you know what I think?
You need to get the fuck out of here.

I'm shaking.

How's she doing?
I think she's stopped breathing!

Hadley! Where are they?
Come on. Don't die.

Come on, Alicia.
Don't die!

Five, six.

Sorry.

Thank you.

I understand you have something
you want to say to me.

Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?
