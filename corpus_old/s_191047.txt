LIFE WITHOUT LOVE IS LIKE EATING
FRENCH FRIES WITHOUT THE KETCHUP

Try this. It's my Creme Brul
made with bird's nest

Thank you

Like my new toothbrush?
You can't buy these in Hong Kong yet

You know what would go
really good with this?

A cup of your coffee!

It's brewing!

Pick the yellow. I love yellow!

I'll put it away for next time

Helen, you're early!

Come on, you knew he had a girlfriend

You have no right to feel this way

Everyone says I'm wasting my time...

but I know things will work out
if I just believe

Faith... and perseverance

Wait...

Sorry Sorry

Jack

Don't walk away like that, please? Jack!

Jack

What a jerk!

It's amazing what some girls
let their boyfriends get away with

Order up!

Hello, Miss Chan. Your table is waiting

Thank you This way please

Hello

You're late. Everyone's already seated
And...

Here, I brought a few samples
for your beautiful girlfriend

Tell her to put it on
before going to bed

What is it?

It's a new alpha-hydroxy
Great for the complexion

Trust me. She'll love it

on a bed of mixed greens
we add heirloom tomatoes...

Ah, did I mention
the heirloom tomatoes...

Why are you so late?

It's about time

Happy Birthday!

Thank you! Thank you!

Alright everyone...

Moon, tonight is to say thank you...

For agreeing to design
Chi-On's clinic... and...

Happy Birthday!

My turn!

Thank you, Helen

You do everything so well...
even arrange birthday parties

Make a wish
Hurry and find that perfect man

Finding a man is easy
I want someone who challenges me

Men are no match for us women
They spend all their time flirting

Right, Chi-on?

Jill, sit down and join us

Yeah. Take a break!

I can't. I still have to make the coffee

Jill, are you alright?

I'm fine

What are you doing there?

I'm here to see Jason

Jason? He's not here

Wow... what's wrong with your eye?

Let me guess... Cyclops... Captain Hook?

No? Oh! I caught you
cheating on your boyfriend!

I'm not in the mood for your jokes!
Do you know him?

Do I know him?
Maybe you should go see your doctor

I told you. This is Jack
the chef who'll be taking my place

Are you out of your mind?

What do you mean taking your place?

You're the one who's lost her mind

Hey! People in love
usually see the world more clearly...

But you're like a zombie

Oh... I remember you!

Does she always talk
like a scratched record?

That's her charm

Her name is Jill

Mysterious Jill

A nearly extinct Jill

So called extinct Jill

Helen, you've gone out
with this guy for so long...

Would you ever consider marrying him?

Yeah... why aren't you two
married already?

Actually, I'm thinking of dumping him

I'm not joking
I want to be a girlfriend...

not a watch dog

Huh? Oh, charades...

Nightmare on Elm Street!

Pig on a spit!

Oh, I know! Rain Man!

Bruce Lee...

That's what I was going to say!

Enter the dragon

Cat scratch fever? Hit you in the head?

Return of the Zombies!

Ms. So says...
there's light at the end of the tunnel

I never thought Helen would leave him

Don't get so excited

It may be a trap
to lure you out from the dark

Helen must know
otherwise why would she do it here?

Already nosing around
other people's business?

Don't be surprised
if you're next to get dumped

What did you tell her about me?

It's like this...

Jill's entire body has been infected
by a terrible virus: Love

Let me introduce you to someone
more normal. This is Apple

He means me!

Move!

Pure. Never been touched...

Tell him to take his womanizing ways
someplace else

Okay... It's amazing

Who wants to try? I do!

Me too! Ladies, wait your turn!

Will you take our picture first?

Of course... smile everyone!

I don't see the problem
He loves taking pictures

It could be good advertising
for the restaurant

If he loves bathing
will you put a bath tub in here?

Good idea

Hmmm... I should ask him about that

What is this?

The bottle you have...

that's not what I'm drinking
I'm drinking this... whiskey

That's castor oil
which I used to massage my tired legs

Hey, I hear castor oil helps get rid of
blood clots in the heart!

Can we get started?

Sure. Fatty, remind me to order the wine

Why are we even here?

We never get anything done
at these meetings!

What are you doing?

I'm SMS'ing my girlfriend
telling her you won't let us go

I don't want her
to bug me about not calling

Hello, Faye?

No, there's no meeting tonight

See you. Bye

Hey, what kind of a person are you?
How can you do such a thing?

You said she bugs you, right?

Okay, let's talk about the menu please

I have a question

Does anyone ever order
the Rice with Duck Blood?

Customers with taste will appreciate it

If people are looking for magic shows...

they can go to the circus

Anything else? No? Good. Meeting's over

That dish is why her boyfriend
always comes here

I can't believe you wanted
to take it off the menu!

Jason moved back to Hong Kong
to be with his wife

And Daddy turned against
his own father to marry Mom...

See, Fluffy, people in love
do crazy things all the time

Give me the bottle, please?

Miss, are you getting in or out?

I know, Fluffy, you despise him too

He thinks he can charm
his way out of everything

To love someone like that
would spell anyone's doom

Jackpot!

Fluffy, your friend has diarrhea

It figures...

It figures I'd run into you

I expect you to replace
that bottle of wine by tomorrow morning

This is Hungarian wine
We don't serve this in the restaurant...

I don't steal!

What is it about me that you hate?

What do I hate?

Your disregard
for other people's feelings

Typical woman
What does that mean?

It means people see
what they want to see

Save your acting for someone else

Forget it, it's useless talking to you

You think you're so cool!
Like you can have any woman you want

Fluffy, bite him!

Hey... what are you doing? Help!

I'M NO LONGER THE OTHER WOMAN!

I still can't decide

Coco or Chloe?

I'm not hungry. You go ahead

Are you even listening to me?

The telephone will not ring not matter
how hard you stare at it

I'm just checking for messages

There are 14 million SMS messages sent
every day in Hong Kong

If you didn't get one, that means
he's not thinking about you...

It used to be the wife
who waited for the husband to come home

Now it's the mistress...

who waits for a call at midnight

Tea, please

He got dumped in front of
all his friends

Wouldn't you be upset
if that happened to you?

Listen...

Helen was with him 5 years
and look how things ended up

What does that tell you?

Nothing

Actually, Helen never knew about me

That's the understanding
I have with Chi-on

Okay, so you and Chi-on
have an understanding

Pass the pickles...

Then tell me, are you
or aren't you his girlfriend?

Of course I am

But nobody knows, right?

Oh, it's supposed to be a secret

That's right

Cover your ears my baby!

Your Godmother is out of her mind

Do you realize...

how ridiculous you sound?

Privacy is important to Chi-on

I'm the only one who understands this

That's why he gave me a set of his keys...
I believe in him

You do?

Where's my Hello Kitty?

Excuse me. Hello

I went to your place this morning...

with a cake
I didn't snoop around or anything

I just put it in the fridge and left
Hello?

I'm here

Where did you put my new toothbrush?

Jill, sorry

I have a patient here. I can't talk. Bye

OK. Bye

What did he say?
What happened to Hello Kitty?

It's just a stupid toothbrush

Where did you go?

I haven't seen the Jill I love
since you met this guy

Hey, you used to
say how pregnant women...

reminded you of those little blowfish...
Now you're one of them!

Mr. Lau, party of four

Got it. We'll see you at eight...

Before and after... What do you think?

I want you to move everything back. Now!

I can't. It's my turn...

Hey, let me help!

We can fit in two more tables like this

Nothing wrong with more business
right...

Ready... smile!

By the way, your tiramisu ice cream
is a little hard today

He's an embarrassing, disgusting
utter fake...

What did you put
in your Black Forest cake?

The usual. Eggs
Bittersweet chocolate...

Did you use nuts of any kind?

You're amazing!
I used a new recipe and yes

The cake had peanut butter in it

Peanut butter?

Aren't you aware lots of people
are allergic to nuts?

No, I didn't Bye!

I have to take my friend
to the hospital now

Hello...

You know if you take
your tiramisu ice cream...

And add a little peanut butter
it's excellent!

Moon won't be joining us tonight
You know why?

Something terrible happened
at her boyfriend's house!

I know all about it!

You know?

Her new boyfriend fed her black forest
cake made with peanut butter inside

Now her face is swollen
like a real full moon!

A peanut butter pastry
filled by a black heart...

No wonder her face is red and puffy!

Sorry...

Happy Birthday!

Very smooth. And full bodied...

You like it?

There's lots more

All made with love by our Big Sister

You aren't having any?

I can't! Another drop
and my heart will stop beating

Bye...

Ahhh, perfect timing

Remember when we first spoke?

I told you Jill was an unusual girl...

When she feels down

she tries not to take it out on others...

Instead, she takes out her aggression
by making coffee

That's class!

What's bothering her?

What's at the root...

Of any woman's unhappiness?

A broken heart

Go ask her yourself...

Maybe today's not a good day!

Wow! Very bitter

Are you okay?

Just a little concussion, that's all

Want to have a discussion
about that concussion?

Please... get lost!

Wait! Are you walking your dog?

Did Jason tell you?

That's sweet

I've seen a lot of dogs before
But never an imaginary one!

Hey, boy... What's your name?

Please. Let Go!
Fluffy hates anything fake!

Please!
He knows there's nothing fake here

Good boy...

He can probably smell
who's broken hearted, too

Miss So, come quick!

What's the matter?

Pliers!

Thanks

He seems very nice... and clean

He's a co-worker. Don't get any ideas

Look at that bottom!
Round like your father's

That means he's responsible

You need to pinch him to see if it's firm

Your father's was soft...
That's why he passed away so young

It's just a loose screw
I think I can get it

Do you want to date my daughter?

My mom says thank you very much!

You're welcome

Why do you always change my words?

Stop it, Mother. He's not my type

How will you know
if you don't meet more guys?

Chi-on is not the only man out there

Do you have a girlfriend?

Yes. I do

Is she as pretty as my daughter?

They're both attractive...

But Jill is a little cuter

How so?

Well, to begin with, her mother is cute!

You should get to sleep
I'll clean this up later

I like your friend

Not only does he have a nice bottom
He has a wonderful heart, too

Look at you

Do you really want a man
who makes you cry?

You must have been hurt before?

It was nice meeting you. Goodnight

I'm not disappointed
I just don't see any future for us

No. That sounds ridiculous...

You'll know what you had when I'm gone...

We're over!

I wanted to leave a long time ago...

Ha! Don't be silly!
You have your life and I have mine...

Hello. Did we have plans today?

No

What's the matter?

Nothing

Are you alright? I'm fine!

After you lose a few pounds
doing the hula...

I want you to come back and cook for us

I'm not the one who needs to lose weight!

Besides, no chef worth
his salt has a flat tummy!

Anyway, with Jack doing the cooking
what alternative is there?

He's like the chef of all chefs!

If someone else praises my food
that's fine

But in the master's presence
I'm only an apprentice

You know what a master is?

It's what people call you
when it's time to retire!

By the way

This hat is now officially yours

That's right! Boys do the cooking
Girls run the dining room...

Where's Jill?

Hiding again?

God of Gourmet, we have come to
worship in your temple!

Oh... God of Gourmet!

Do you know the game rules?

You have to eat five meals
to receive a photo coupon

Then for $500 more, you can be baptized

You want to join? Yes!

Kids today
They must be controlled by evil spirits!

Let's make a member's pass first

This way Great!

That playboy of yours misbehaving again?

It's like you want to cry
but can't, right?

I'm not that kind of person

We might be having problems
but I'm not giving up on him

Friends or lovers
I'm in it for the long haul

Besides, if I did start over again

I'd probably end up with...

someone even worse... like Jack!

I think you have the wrong idea

He's not what you think

Did you know... I know all about it!

I know all about it!
Tell me. You're a man...

How many times can a man
hurt the same woman?

You tell me!

How hurt a woman can be, I can't tell

But how hurt a man can be, I do know

I don't like talking about
my personal life

But I promised Jason I'd work here

And I don't want you to be angry with me

My girlfriend, her name is Grace
She's an air-hostess

Last week
she said she was flying to London

I found out she was actually...

in Hong Kong with another man

She came to find me wearing her uniform
her luggage in tow...

pretending she just came back from work

We've been together now
for a year and a half

I thought to myself...

what did I do that
made her look for someone else?

We sat down and had a nice talk

Turns out...

she's been with this other man
for seven years

She was cheating on you
from the very beginning...

She said she doesn't mind
the extra effort...

That she'd love me no matter what

What are you laughing at?

Tonight, we're officially partners

I never realized there were
so many heartbroken people

What's his name?

Chi-On Wai

No, I'm talking about the dog

Him?

Oh, Fluffy

What breed is he?

Cocker Is he a seeing eye dog, too?

Perfect for people like me
who have eyes but can't see

You have such an interesting way
of putting things

Interesting is the only way
to live, right?

Hmm... smell that?

Stinky tofu!

How long have you lived in the area?

About two months

One day my girlfriend called

She said she had found her dream home

We moved in and had everything unpacked
within three days

That is so sweet

I actually thought we'd get married

Listen to me;
women expect men to be the aggressors

It's the law of the jungle
If you want her back...

you have to act the part
King of the Jungle!

King of the Jungle, huh?

I don't see you fighting for your man

Women who fight for their men
are considered cheap

Putting pride before love-
that's also cheap

Swallowing your pride and
losing your love- That's even cheaper!

You're quite romantic, aren't you?

Absolutely!

Hey! Here's to our little club!

Fluffy is afraid of strangers

Fluffy knows me
Look, he's wagging his tail

Come On... No!

Let me hold him He doesn't like it!

Oh no!

Fluffy!

He's breathing...

He's still breathing!

Hey, he's moving. He's responding...
He's waking up!

Hurry, let's take him to the hospital!

Where's the hospital? Come on, let's go!

What are you doing?

Getting rid of old stock

Stop!

Canned food is edible for like ten years!

We can't use any of this

Would you dump your girlfriend
this easily?

I was the one who was dumped

Then let's not talk about broken hearts...

I'm not talking about me!

What's going on?

You're acting very strange today

I'm happy for you, silly...

There's someone here to see you...

Stop holding those cans!
She's waiting for you

It's not easy to come
looking for your man three times!

I have nothing to say to her

What's there to say?

Go down there and give her a kiss

Women hate men who don't know...

when to take action

Your lips are so dry!

See? You really do miss her

Mine hasn't called in two days

Consider yourself lucky

Men don't always know
how to express themselves

It could be he's still thinking of...

how to say what he's feeling

Trust me!

Jack is such a lady killer!

I would faint if
someone kissed me like that

Wow, looks like we're having
a French kiss marathon!

Look at her!

You'd think she's
never been kissed before

If Chi-on kissed you like that
you'd be even more excited!

Where's the fire? And who's Jill So?

That would be... me

THE FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL...

CHI- ON IS MY SPECIAL ONE

Hello! Hi... Jill

I'm running late

Can we have dinner another time?

I'm already here. You want me to go back?

No...

Never mind...
I'll be there as soon as I can

I brought some T- Bones
and a nice bottle of...

I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye!

Okay

Where did I put my keys?

Am I bothering you?

No. What's wrong?

I wanted to ask you...

If a woman waited for two hours
on your front doorstep...

would you think she's totally cheap?

That depends on what she looks like!

Hey, if it's you, no problem

I'm serious

Chi-on said he was running late

But even if he called from Shanghai
he should be here by now!

Look at that face!

It's like a little child
complaining about her allowance

Very cheap!

That's better

If a man calls to say he's running late
he's already stressed

If he sees you with that face
he'll turn around and leave

When you see him, don't ask...

Where were you?

Who were you with?

And don't say anything about
how long you've been waiting

Trust me

He'll appreciate it

How's this?
Sir, here's your food delivery!

Give yourself a little more credit

I'm one of Charlie's Angels
and I'm here to guard your house!

That's too silly

You spent two hours in a meeting
on top of thinking about me...

you must be exhausted!

How's that?

Irresistible

You look irresistible yourself
Grace will be happy to see you

Who is that behind you?

Huh? Oh. That's my cousin

That's my cousin Hi!

Hi This is Jill

Jew? A Chinese Jew?

Cut it out! He likes to joke around

I have to go
Grace and I are seeing a movie tonight

Bye! Bye!

Bye! You hung up
before I could even say goodbye

I said it for you

What are you doing?

I want the truth
I have ways of making you talk!

Oh. You mean Jill?

Who's Jill? A friend...

The girl just now!

Does Grace know?

Know what? She's a co-worker

If she's just a co-worker
why are you sweating?

Look at you! Didn't you just shower?

I'm sweating? Really?

Leave me alone, will you?
There's food in the refrigerator

And don't drink my beer!

As a servant of God
I can control my desires

I wonder what there is to eat?

Your phone's been ringing

Really?

You're not going to answer it?

Do you want me answer the phone
or talk to you?

Why don't you answer your phone?
Who is it?

You want me to answer the phone...
or talk to you?

I've been waiting outside a long time

I know... let's eat first, okay?

I have something to ask...

How about if we order dessert first?

Do you love me?

Do you really love me?

You're a big part of my life

Without you, I would be devastated

Who do you love more? Him... or me?

You must know...

I've told you before...

You're the only woman
who truly understands me

You're avoiding my question

So what if I say I like him more...

or I like you more?

It doesn't make any difference

What matters is I love you
Isn't that enough?

I've worked all night

Can I drink some water first?

But it is important! It's important to me

What's the matter?

Afraid of losing me?

Even if you don't believe me...

you should believe in yourself

I know it's difficult at work
finding enough time to think about me

Sorry

Sorry! I just wanted to say
I know you're exhausted

Don't be silly

Actually
it's me who should be saying sorry

In fact...

Stop. Don't say it. I trust you

Grace...

Hi Hi

I think moving the tables around
has brought us bad luck

Don't spit it out!

Relax! Release your tongue
Swirl it around...

Taste the complexity?

That's my Double Shot Espresso
The Yin and the yang...

A beautiful combination of
bitter and sweet

I never looked at it that way

I hope Grace can appreciate it

Whoever tastes my espresso...

Will never be happy
with regular coffee again!

Hold it right there!
I want to take your picture

Come on! The lighting is beautiful
No

Stop! I look so tired

No you don't. Come on... No

Are you kidding? She doesn't look tired?

Get out of here!

By the way, have you met your rival?

No

Why not?

Scared?

Of what?

I don't know. Scared

I know a place near here that
has fish balls spicier than this!

Shall we get go some when we're done?

Of course you have to
treat me after this. Here!

You won't feel as nervous
after your tongue goes numb

Everyone should be free to choose. What
she does is actually none of my business

You're giving up? After all this!

It's not that

I just can figure out
if it's him or me who was cheated

This is not the time to be polite

You're better than him

Hold this

This is not a competition
but a chance for her to choose!

10 o'clock!

3 o'clock! Got it! 3 o'clock!

What are you doing turning right?

You said 3 o'clock!

She lied to me!
She said she was working the day shift!

Come on, turn right, no... turn left

Okay Turn left

Turn left
That way! Let me drive

Hey, no...

Ahhh! The fish balls!

Excuse me... have we met?

So you are...

Sorry, I have a girlfriend

What a coincidence

You two know each other?

This is my boyfriend, Ching-yeung Sung

This is Jack
He's the chef I told you about

Oh, that's you!

Grace always talks about your...

wonderful Italian food

I didn't know you make Indian food, too!

We'll have to try your cooking
when we get back

Isn't your plane leaving soon?

Right!

Sorry, I'm off to Shanghai
Nice meeting you!

Call me when you arrive

I will

Bye Bye

You came to see me off?

What's the matter?

This is all so complicated
Why don't you choose one of us?

Why?

I'm happy with how things are

I love you just the same as I love him

Sorry, then consider me a selfish person!

If you were getting married
who would you choose?

Say something

Did you really say marriage?

I'm so impressed

These are for you

I don't eat this stuff

It's not for you to eat
It's so you can channel your anger

I'm not angry

You don't have to pretend in front of me

You're a good catch
You don't deserve to be dumped

I'll be in the next aisle if you need me

I'm sorry...

Look at this!

Go change your smelly shirt!

Hi, Jill! Out shopping for clothes?

No, I'm here doing my laundry

You have the strangest sense of humor

Don't tell me
you're buying that ugly shirt

Actually, I think this is pretty nice

Chi-on really likes the steaks here

We're cooking at home tonight

Don't look so surprised

These things happen very quickly

It must suck being the other woman, huh?

You know?

I must say, I admire the way
you put up with the pain

Actually, I don't see
what's so special about the cook

What do you mean?

Jason told me all about him

He has a girlfriend, right?

Relationships in your business
are so complicated

He's a professional chef
not just an ordinary cook

Whatever...

I've got to go
Chi-on is waiting for me outside. Bye

What happened?

Nothing

Come on! You don't have to
pretend in front of me

I said nothing's wrong!

There must be something

Here. You need it more than I do

IT'S FINISHED. THE DREAM IS OVER...

Should I save this
for the security guard?

Throw it away!

Hang on!

Let me handle this

You want to help me make a delivery?

Delivery?

That's right. Come on

Don't! He'll know it was me
when he sees the cake

That's the point
Men are different from women

He won't know what you're thinking
You don't tell him

Really?

We can ask Fluffy to keep watch

Fluffy, keep an eye out for us!

Nothing better than freshly- Baked cake!

Let's not do this!

Come on!

Take it! Ready...

I can't do it... I can't!

One... two...

I wish I could see his face
when he gets back

What's up?

Will you help me
watch Fluffy for a second?

Go ahead. Say it

Say what?

I'm pathetic

There's nothing wrong with being in love

It could be he really is
your special one

No matter how serious or how casual
a relationship may be...

I believe there's one person specially
made for each of us...

And I'm specially made for her...

Not her, her, her or her!

I want to believe that...

But everyone out there is special

Look at him, him, him and him
They're all special

My first job was in a hotel in Shanghai

Chi-on was a voluntary doctor
in the countryside nearby

He would come in every night
sit at the same table

That's how you two met?

What time is it?

I don't know

Damn! My battery ran out!

I have plenty of battery
but no one's called

That's even worse, huh Fluffy?

Let's go!

What are you all doing? Avoiding work?

Have you seen Jack
and his girlfriend in there?

That's right
His girlfriend is getting married!

Incredible!
That fool finally touched her heart

You got it half right. He's a fool

She's getting married, but not to Jack!

I can't believe she had the nerve to
bring her fiance here!

Two guys fighting over one girl?
We'd better call the police

I think we'd better call an ambulance

Look at Jack
He looks like he's ready to collapse

She even asked him
to make the wedding cake!

How many layers shall we get?

It's up to you

I'm sorry. We're very busy
this time of the year

We can't help you with your cake

But Jack already said yes

I'm the Catering Manager
and I say we can't do it

Please. I don't mind paying more

I said we don't have the time!

Grace is getting married...

It's my gift to the two of you

This is probably the best wedding gift
we'll receive!

Thank you My pleasure

Wow! This is gorgeous

Help me put it on

I think if a man gave me this as a gift...

I would marry him right then and there!

Excuse me

Thank you

Would the lady like to wear it now
or should I wrap it?

Wrap it, please...

It's a wedding gift

That's right

It's a wedding gift. Thanks

Thanks

Grace will like it, won't she?

Of course she will. She'll love it!

Don't put too much sugar in it
Grace doesn't like things too sweet

You've said that 86 times
Say it again, I'll use salt

Stop!

You can't use a machine
to mix the filling

You have to use... this

This is a four layer cake
It'll be dawn if I mix it by hand

That's why you're here!

I thought you expected that
Here, let me help you

No thanks

I wish I were Grace

She's getting a rich husband...

and an ex-boyfriend who still loves her

All women should be so lucky

Listen, when you get married

I'll make you a cake as well

I'm going to hold you to that promise!

It's all over your face too...

I know I shouldn't be saying this...
What?

Until she says 'I do'...

You still have a chance

It's Jack!

What's he doing here?

Not a clue

I knew he would come for me!

Where are you going?

I was supposed to fly to Italy today...

I'd like to change the destination

Will you check the schedule?

I want to go to Paris instead

When is the next flight?

Tomorrow's perfect!

Okay

Does coffee taste better in the bathroom?

Try it

You never used to drink espresso

And you never gave me gifts
like this before

Why did you ask me back?

I didn't

Say that again

I didn't ask you to come back. I'm sorry

You're sorry?

Didn't you just honk your horn...

And tell the whole world
how much you love me?

If it weren't for you, I'd be in Italy
right now on my honeymoon!

Why don't you go?

Because you showed me
you'd do anything to have me!

If I wanted a stupid necklace like this
I could tell Ching-yeung...

And he would buy
two hundred of them for me!

If that's how you feel...

this is a big mistake

Why did you come for me?

I was delivering your call

You have another woman!

Are you two lovebirds fooling around?

I'm not fooling around. I'm at home

You're one lucky guy...

I'm actually on a special mission

What kind of special mission?

I'm delivering a hot order
of rice with duck blood

He's back?

Yes. He said he was dying to have some

Maybe this is his way of saying sorry

Really?

Good luck then!

Okay, bye

Bye

Hello...?

You're a mommy now

I just had a nightmare...

I woke up and I couldn't find my baby!

That's not true. Look at this huge belly!

My goddaughter will be just like me
big and strong!

See? She's already got
my sense of humor...

She's teasing you. Don't cry

Why are you so pretty today?

We catered an event this afternoon

Look at me! I look like a pig beside you

That's not true

Your complexion is
as pink and flawless as ever

You're even prettier today than
when I first met you

How can a mother...

with such a pretty face be ugly?

Really?

Of course! Don't cry
The tears are ruining your smile

Wipe them off

You're not thinking of leaving me
are you?

I'm afraid you want to leave me!

Where to, miss?

Special One...

Is that in Hong Kong or Kowloon?

Hong Kong. I mean...

Take the tunnel to Hong Kong Island

Okay

Drink lots of water
I want your skin to stay soft and pretty

Bye

Mom, why is dating so painful?

I don't ever want to see
another man again

What are you saying?

Blood is thicker than water

I still don't understand
what you're saying

I said your breasts are touching
your belly button

Did you hear the news?

Grace left her fiance
at the altar to be with Jack

Jack is such a charmer
I'm not surprised

Yeah, but did you hear the rest?
Jack dumped Grace

You've counted it so many times...

It's all there... $12,000

OK, everyone. Let's get started

I'm sure all of you know
this Thursday is my birthday

I don't want you to stress about
what to buy me...

and let it affect your work so I...

I already have a present

Last year whatever I gave her
she didn't like

So this time I got a gift certificate
Is that smart or what?

I've already done my job

Two years ago I bought 10 presents
So now I give you one every year

Besides, how could I forget
your birthday since...

it's the same day
as my wedding anniversary?

Better to owe the loan sharks than
to owe her a birthday gift!

What should I get you?

I can make the cake

These things have been planned
for a long time ago

That's right!

Sure. Of course

Jack...

how did it go the other night?

I... what about you?

Was Chi-on happy when he got the rice?

Uhhh, you want some coffee?

Sure

What are you doing?

This is my secret recipe

55 beans make the perfect cup of espresso

Not one more...

Not one less

Sounds like a relationship

Two people should be equally important...

Not one more, not one less

The coffee's working
I feel much better now

Remember, the secret is 55 beans

See you at my party?

I'll be there

Father, your friend needs help

Go get changed!
The kids are waiting for our presents

Hurry up!

Am I overdressed...

For a birthday party?

You look fine

Are you going to a funeral?

Oh... I can still change

Shut up!

Wait for me at the elevator

Do you know what you look like now?

What?

You look like
you're getting ready to see Nina

Who's Nina?

Your first love in high school

Very sweet, this 2nd puberty of yours
Say happy birthday for me

I get to change I do the packing

Wow, the food is beautiful

Wanna try?

It's delicious!

It's so good!

Chief...

you look very sexy tonight!

Sexy enough that you'd date me?
Definitely!

Oh! It's so tasty!
Hey! Let me take a picture of you

The forgotten boyfriend!

Surprise!
It's a birthday cake from Chi-on!

It's beautiful!

Happy birthday, Jill!

This cake was specially designed by
Francois De La Bouche!

I know the guy
He means Frenchy Fry de Bullshit!

The cake looks sort of brownish
doesn't it?

It does!

I saw this exact one in an MTR cake shop!

Never mind. Let's cut it!

Thanks. I'll take that!

Chief, don't you think
your hands are a little low?

And you seem to be...

What? Happy?

I was thinking... enchanted

Go find yourself another partner!

Hello...

Really?

Everybody's enjoying your cake

I broke up with Moon. We're over

Come with me to Shanghai together...
spend a few months

Go where with you?

I thought you'd be happy

I'm extremely happy... today

Jill, I promise...

I'll make you happy forever

Sorry

You're kidding! I'll come right away

Who was it?

I have to go. It's urgent

Where's Jason?

The police decided
not to charge him with vagrancy

Hungry?

No

What's the matter?

You think I'm crazy?

Lydia loved dancing salsa...

But after we got married

we never had time for dancing

I would always say...

wait till the business settles down

When it settled down I told her...

wait till I retire

When she got sick...

I told her

the chemotherapy will heal you...

It's only six months
to our 20th anniversary...

Wait and we can gather
all our friends to dance

But she couldn't wait

Now I'm retired

She dressed like this...

Whenever we went dancing

Lydia was like my shadow

She'd know where to go
if I just moved a finger

I used to think I chose her...

because she was the one woman
I could live with

Only later, dancing alone
did I realize...

she was my only partner

I married her because...

she's the one woman I can't live without

I think he'll have
a huge hangover tomorrow

Good thing your phone
still had battery when he called

I'm freezing

You feel cold?

Would you turn up the heat?

How's that?

I have a present for you

Why didn't you say so?

Where is my present?

It's around here somewhere...

What's that?

This...

helps promote circulation

I try and hang upside down
at least 20 minutes every day

You look like spider-land

Spider-land? You mean Spiderman

Are you drunk?

Where is my present?

Is this it?

Let's open it

Fluffy!

Look! He already likes you!

He's adorable! Yes, he is

Do you like him?

I love him!

Thank you
This is the best birthday present ever

I'M NOT LOOKING
TO CHANGE THE WORLD...

I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED
BY THE RIGHT PERSON

Where are you going?

I'm late

It's six in the morning!

I have a tai chi class!

You want to have lunch today?

Jack, I need some time

Actually, last night when I carried you...

you fell asleep

Nothing happened

Hold on a second

It's me
Have you thought about what I said?

What's that?

The trip to Shanghai...

Listen, Chi-on...

Jill, I won't take no for an answer

Meet me at the restaurant
Six o'clock tonight

I know everything
seems impossible right now

But love is actually very simple

Last night was a rising tide of emotions

I'm afraid of getting seasick

Jill, I won't disappoint you

See you at the restaurant
Six o'clock. Bye

You're getting prettier every day

Hurry, Fatty! It's getting good!
What's up?

No way

This is for you
You can't buy these in Hong Kong yet

I've always been afraid of
missing out on life

That's why my suits
are made in London...

My car is from Italy

I bet they won't break up

I bet they will

I second that

I'm with Jason

I bet they won't break up

You know it!

I still bet they will. Right?

Do you understand what I'm saying?

I want to give it a try. Just you and me!

The problem is you don't understand me

I used to be scared of losing you
I never had the guts to speak up

All I want is someone who loves me

I bet they don't

You said it!

I have an idea!

Even your idea won't break them up
That's right!

A relationship doesn't mean being with
whoever happens to be around

It should mean being with that one person
you can't live without

Thank you! Thanks!

I'm never betting on you again!

What's up?

It's beautiful

Were you naked when you posed for it?

Were you at least wearing pants?

Shoes maybe?

No matter what happens...

I just want to say
you'll always be my special one

When you first put on that necklace

I saw that smile of yours...

I don't ever want to be
without that smile!

Two words

What two words?

Happy...

Totally thrilled...

Very excited!

Chicken skin!

You think I have chicken skin?

No... I think you're amazing

Two words

Fluffy!

Good boy!

Isn't the necklace...

A wonderful collar for him?

Fluffy!

I'd like the rice with duck blood, please

I'm sorry. We don't serve that anymore

We have a new dessert
'Ice Mountain on Fire'

Our chef is demonstrating it
right over there!

It's gonna overburnt... 1, 2, 3

I'll have one of those! Me too...

OK Me too... Same here...

Ice Mountain on Fire!
