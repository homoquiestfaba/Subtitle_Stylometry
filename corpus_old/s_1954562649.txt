Soldier 1: (On radio)
<i> They're taking fire</i>
<i> from the woods.</i>

<i> They're waiting</i>
<i> for the tanks.</i>

<i> Enemy fire from</i>
<i> our right flank.</i>

<i> our right flank.</i>

Soldier 2: <i> Princess red 6</i>
<i> for culture.</i>

<i> Hold fast. This is</i>
<i> the worst of it, boys. Over.</i>

Soldier 3: <i> Sergeant Humphrey</i>
<i> just showed up.</i>

Soldier 1: <i> Have you</i>
<i> any information</i>
<i> on the right flank?</i>

Soldier 2: <i> Culture,</i>
<i> that's a negative.</i>

<i> Move.</i>

Soldier 4: <i> This is able 2.</i>
<i> The 88 is in that church.</i>

<i> They threw one at us</i>
<i> when we drove by.</i>

(Soldier screams)

Soldier 5: <i> Negative.</i>
<i> It's all over!</i>

<i> Come in, come in.</i>

<i> Do you read me?</i>
<i> Do you read me?</i>

(metal clattering)

(Heavy breathing)


Son of a bitch!

(Heavy breathing)

Did you get that fucker?

Knocked him off.

Gordo, stop.
Leave him rest.

Uh-uh.

Wardaddy:
Gordo, he's dead.

He's dead!
Show some respect.

Leave him alone.

He's your fault!

God damn it.
Ain't you done yet?

You got no right to be
fucking sore with me.
Quit fucking riding me.

I ain't riding you.
If I was riding you,
you'd know it.

More where he came from.

Hey, fuck you, don!
It's your fucking
fault we here.

Are you still talking?
Let's get out of here.

Aah! Fuck! What the fuck
you do that for?

I'm trying to fix it!
Wardaddy: You know why.

You want to
fucking whup me?

It ain't gonna
fucking help anything!

(Radio static)

Probate, fox 6.

Coon-ass: I say,
why you always
whupping on me?

'Cause you're an animal,
a dog.

All you understand
is the fist and boot.

Don, I'm telling
you right now,
don't fucking call me that.

I ain't a fucking animal.
I ain't a fucking dog.

(Speaking Spanish)

Hey, you want
to talk Mexican,

join another tank,
a Mexican tank.

This is an American tank,
we talk American.

Who put the fucking
nickel in you, top?

You talk kraut!

You talk German!
I can't talk Spanish?

Bible, what country we in?
Germany.

Germany, they speak German.

Could you explain to him
it's a tool of war?

Boyd: It's a tool
of war, gordo.

Here's my tool of war.

Top.

Gordo: You knew German
before we got in
this fucking war!

Don't play stupid
with me.

I expect all of you to
pull your shit together.

I wish you'd stop
ragging on everyone.

You didn't kill red,
Germans did.

That is true, but
I didn't save him, either.

His number came up,
that's all.

We've been lucky till now.

We've been lucky?

Yes, sir.

We're all alive.
We're in here.

God's grace?

(Distant rumbling)


Rain's coming.


Coon-ass, anytime,
sweetheart.

I'm your sweetheart, right?

crank her up.

(Engine whining)

Choke her up. She's cold.

There's condensation
on the plugs.

(Engine whines)
(Loud rumbling)

Fuckers!

(Engine revving)

All right, move out.
Get us out of here.

Bible, gun front.

Roger.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(men screaming)

Man: Come on, move it!

Get those cases
out of here!

(Distant explosions rumbling)

I thought you were dead.

Devil watches over
his own. Binkowski.

Good to see you.

Don, glad you
made it back.

Wardaddy:
Crew still together?
Nate? Lindburgh?

Doing well.

Good.

Boyd: Grab his arm.
Coon-ass: Here you go.

Okay.

Boyd: Lay him down.
Lay him down.

Move.

Set him down soft.

Sergeant.

Sergeant.

Medic: Lift.


Where's the rest
of third platoon?

We're it.

Coon-ass: Hey, Boyd?

Hey, Boyd, they...
They gonna send
him home, right?

Boyd: I don't know
that, grady.

Red's got us all
a little sad right now,
but we got a job to do.

Grady, restock
ammo and rations.
Gordo, water and gas.

Boyd, get some chow
and do what you can
about the mechanical issues.

We can't do shit
about mechanical issues.
Where you going?

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

Norman:
First sergeant Collier?

Wardaddy: Maybe.
What the fuck are you?

Private Ellison.

I was told to report
to you. I'm your new
assistant driver.

No, you are not.

Yes, yes, I am.
God damn it.

Who told you this?

Master sergeant
with the clipboard.

Bullshit!
Right there. He's...


What's your name?

Norman.

How long you
been in the army?

Eight weeks.


That's home.

Do as you're told.

Don't get too close
to anyone.

Boyd:
<i> Â¶ on a hill far away</i>


<i> Â¶ Stood an old rugged cross</i>


<i> Â¶ The emblem</i>
<i> of suffering and shame</i>

<i> Â¶ I love the old cross</i>

<i> Â¶ where the dearest...</i>

<i> Â¶ I will cling to</i>
<i> the old rugged cross Â¶</i>

hi. Hi. I'm Norman.

Which...
Which way is the front?

"Which way is the front?"

Hmm.

All around us, kid,
'cause this is Germany.

We're surrounded by krauts.

Ain't that right, grady?

Coon-ass: That's right.

Can I please
have my book back?

Gordo: Where
are the cigarettes?

I don't smoke.

You're a bastard.

You go to tank school?

Tank school? No.

I've never even seen
the inside of a tank.

I'm a clerk typist.

Was heading
to fifth corps hq,

they pulled me
off the truck.

They sent me here.

It's got to be a mistake.

Coon-ass: Mistake?

Army don't make mistakes.

It wouldn't do.

You from Missouri?

No.

Are you from Chicago?

You from Arkansas,
ain't you?

No, I'm from Pittsburgh...
Hey, hush up, man.

Nobody gives a fuck
where you from.

Are you a praying man?

I go to church.

Which denomination are you?

Episcopalian?

Yeah, you are.
You're a mainliner,
ain't you?

Yeah. I am.

Are you saved?

I'm baptized.
(Coon-ass chuckles)

Boyd: That ain't
what I asked you.

That ain't what
he asked you.

Boyd: Gordo,
what'd I ask him?
See, you got to listen.

Gordo: Say it again.
Boyd: Are you saved?

Wait until you see it.

See what?

What a man can do
to another man.

Coon-ass:
Before you find Jesus,

why don't you come
take a look at your seat?

That's where
you're gonna be.

Get a bucket of hot water
from the kitchen.
Get that shit clean.

(Heavy breathing)

(Distant rumbling)

(Rumbling continues)



Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

Davis: Weren't supposed to
be no more tigers, don.

Tell my platoon that.

Binkowski:
You send five tanks out.

One comes back.

It's hard to believe
we're winning the war.

(Rumbling continues)


Davis: Stop talking about
yesterday's fight.

Think about today's.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

soldier 1: Straighten out!

Soldier 2: Hey!
What's an ss doing here?

Hey, why are you
bringing him
through here?

Why isn't
he sleeping?

G2 wants a prisoner
to question.

Oh, I'll question him.

What's your favorite color?

Are you a good dancer?

Do you like fat girls?

Soldier 1: Get back!
Soldier 2: Beat his ass!

Soldier 3: Stop! Stop it!

(Indistinct arguing)

Wardaddy: Fucker!
Davis: Fuck him up, don!

Motherfucker!

Get the fuck...
Get back!

Go!
Fucking tankers.

It's me, it's me.

You got mps everywhere.
You got to stop now.

Just stop.
Davis: I spilled
my fucking coffee.

Cocksuckers.
Come on, grady.

Fucking ss.

Gordo: You good, top?

Bring him
through this camp...


You see that?

He's an ss.

You kill every
last one you can.
They're real assholes.

Fuck every last one.
They started it.

We finishing it.
Gordo: That's it.

Done much killing?

No.

You will.

Boys, take him
through that gun.
Roger.

Wh-what do I do with this?
"Wh-what..." Shut up.

Take a look at it.

See that cover?
Yeah.

Open it.

And now you killing.

Close it up.

Now you ain't.

Main unit's punching east.

We are going north on
a flank guard mission.

We'll tie up
with Baker company
from the 41st.

Sergeant Collier's
with us now.

He'll be acting
platoon sergeant.

Fine by me.

Good to have you, don.

We're meeting
Baker company here.

Then, together
we'll take this town.

After that,
we're working for
captain waggoner.

Any questions?

I got one question.

Peterson?

I'm binkowski, sir.

Uh...

You start shaving
your face?

First platoon,
mount up!

Move out!

(Distant rumbling)

War's not
going anywhere, sir.

You heard him.
Mount up!

Hey!

Go fuck yourself, wardaddy!

Coffee's too hot.

Still owe me 40 bucks!

What'd he say?

Soldier: Mount up!
Let's go, gents.

Move front!

Coon-ass: (Chuckling)
Motherfucker.

Wardaddy:
Okay, guns ready.

Soldier: Good luck, gentlemen!

(Distant rumbling)

All right,
there might be a wolf
hiding in the sheep.

Kid, you're up.
Cast an eyeball on them.

(Over radio)
<i> Anything that makes a move,</i>
<i> you cut them right in half.</i>

People are in the way,
that's their problem.

You do what you
got to do, copy?

Norman: (Over radio) <i> Copy.</i>
You copy?

I copy.

Gordo, talk him
through that gun again.

Gordo: <i> Roger.</i>

Hey, gun's ready.
Just pull the trigger.

Every five rounds
is a tracer

so you can see
what you're hitting.

And remember,
short bursts.

That way you harvest
more meat per bullet.

(Wardaddy speaking German)

The Americans are over there

keep moving

keep your hands up

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

she'll let you fuck her
for a chocolate bar.

That's not true.

It's not true?

No.

Okay. It's not true.

It's completely
fucking true.

You ain't got to fuck
around and give her
a whole pack, neither.

Norman, ignore him.
Fucking four will do it.

Don't disappoint
Christ, now.

Don't let them
lead you astray.

You see, we can kill them,
but we can't fuck them,

<i> 'cause it says so</i>
<i> in the Bible.</i>

Boyd: Stop, all right?

I'm done trying to
convert you heathens.

You mind if I continue
invading Germany?

Boyd, do you think
Jesus loves Hitler?

Do I think
Jesus loves Hitler?

I'd assume so.

If Hitler accepted
Jesus into his heart

and got baptized,
he'd be saved.

It ain't gonna save him
from man's justice.

What about
your regular-issue
Nazi line trooper?

No, I'm not gonna
do this with you.
Is he going to heaven?

We've been talking about
the same dumb shit
for three years.

You know how I stand on it.
You trying to rile me up now.

Hey, what about me, huh?
You think you
could save me?

<i> Sing me a hymn?</i>

Yeah, sure.
Sing <i> old rugged cross.</i>

I like the way your mouth
moves when you sing.

Don't.
I like it.

I'll sing it
if you don't do that.

Don't touch me. Stop!
I just wanna touch
your mustache.

Why does that
bother you so much
when I touch your mustache?

I'll shoot you, I swear!
All right, knock it off.

Knock off the horseplay.

Boyd, do you think
Hitler'd fuck one of us
for a chocolate bar?


I hope so.


(Indistinct chatter
over radio)

Boyd: Ambush! Right!

Right side, ambush!

(Indistinct shouting)
Fuck! Grady!

Coon-ass: You watch
that tree line! We're
ripe for an ambush!


Boyd: Grady, cover right!

(Screaming continues)

Parker: Father!


Wardaddy:
What'd you see, Boyd?

Coon-ass:
Just go out and blast
them little fuckers!

What'd you see?

Boyd: I didn't see nothing.

Norman!

You cocksucker.
Why didn't you take the shot?

He was just a kid.
I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry, sergeant.

You see
what a kid can do?

Look!

That's your fault.

That's your fucking fault.

Next German you see
with a weapon,

you rake the dog shit
out of him.

I don't care
if it's a baby with
a butter knife in one hand

and mama's titty
in the other.

You chop him up!
Yes, sergeant!

(Norman groans)

Bible?
Yeah?


All tanks, wardaddy.


Looks like I'm it.

I'll lead the column.
Let's get us
where we're going.

(Engines starting)

Man: We have this thing
set up and on the way.

I sent over a couple men
to keep contact,

and the officers
have been briefed.
(Distant whoosh)


(Rapid gunshots)

Wardaddy:
Stop right here, gordo.

Baker company?
Yes, sir!

I'm not a sir.

Me, neither.

Where's your boss?
Wardaddy: Dead.

Who's in charge
of this column?

I am.

Good. I'm talking to
the right man.

Park it over there.
Old man's waiting.

(Airplanes passing overhead)

(Explosions rumbling nearby)

Man: Yes, thank you, sir,

don't tell me how long
my casualties can last.

Unless you want
to come down here,

stand knee-deep in their guts
and form an opinion.

Baker 6 out.

Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
How you doing?

Load the casualties
into a truck.

We're gonna drive them
back to base ourselves.

Take care of our own.
Come with me.

Hey, wake up!

All right,
how many tanks we got?

Four.

Four? You're shitting me.

I asked for 10.

Miles! Sergeant Miles!

Yes, sir?

Get first platoon ready.

You're working for him now.

If they can stand,
they're in play.

Roger.

All right,
here's the deal.

I got a platoon
trapped in this beet field

by machine guns.

I sent my tracks in.

Jerry took them out.

So, anti-tank guns there,
there, possibly there,
I don't know.

I need you
to rescue my guys.

Take the guns out.

I can do that.

All right, that clears
this road into town,
you push forward.

I'll join you there.
We'll clear it up.

Maybe they'll surrender.
Or maybe they'll fight.


This high ground,
you got any eyes on it?

I had eyes there, gone.
There, gone.

We're flying blind.
It's you and me.

Krauts got sights
on this road.

I don't want to
show my flank.

Any objection if
I come in here?

You can arrive on
a fucking magic carpet,
for all I care.

I know who you are.
I know you know
what you're doing.

You just paste them
hard for me.

They murdered
some good boys
out there today.

Why don't they just quit?

Would you?

We got a platoon pinned down
in this field by mgs.

Krauts got anti-tank
covering the field.

And once we cross
this hedgerow,

we will be in range
and in their line of sight,
so be alert.

Hit anything
that fucking moves.

Yeah, unless
they pound us first.

Wardaddy: If they do,
we'll know exactly
where they are.

Let's get these
boys out of there
and smash those guns.

Then we'll capture the town,
stop for the night. Clear?

Why are we rescuing
kittens instead of just
driving down into Berlin?

Why are you such an asshole?
That's a great question.

March order.
Fury, old Phyllis,
Lucy sue, murder inc.

Let's go.

Miles: All right,
fuck sticks.

Mount up! By squad!

Soldier: All right, mount up!

Wardaddy:
<i> All tanks, comm check.</i>

Peterson: <i> 1-4's up.</i>

Davis: <i> Love 1-3 copies.</i>

Soldier: That's right, man.
Wardaddy: Need you
to hold tight!

All tanks, wardaddy.

When we hit open ground,
line up on me.

(Over radio)
<i> Keep your spacing,</i>
<i> don't bunch up.</i>

<i> On my signal,</i>
<i> we'll drop the doughs</i>

<i> and roll up that 75.</i>

<i> Everyone copy?</i>

Binkowski:
Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

Peterson: Copy.
Davis: <i> Love 1-3 copies.</i>

Wardaddy: <i> Gordo, halt.</i>

<i> All tanks halt.</i>
<i> All tanks halt.</i>

(Engine revs)

All right,
let's get the boys off.

Get them off.
Give me last man.

Miles: All right, ladies,
you heard the man.
<i> Button up.</i>

Everybody off!

Move out! Move!
Everybody off!

Close your hatch.

(Indistinct
overlapping chatter)

(Indistinct radio chatter)

Wardaddy: (Over radio)
<i> All tanks, move out.</i>
<i> Hard right. Hard right.</i>

<i> Move them out.</i>
Binkowski:
<i> Hard right. Hard right.</i>

Peterson:
<i> Fury's going. Let's go.</i>

Binkowski: <i> Move, move,</i>
<i> move, move, move.</i>

Peterson: Let's move now.
A hard stick right.

Binkowski:
Everybody hold yourself.
Jiggs, hold on.

Soldier 1: Form in. Form in.

Soldier 2: <i> Catch up</i>
<i> with the fury.</i>

Binkowski: <i> Stick right.</i>

<i> Now, catch up.</i>

On my line, guys,
on my line.

<i> More gas. More gas.</i>
Mix it up.

Miles: Keep them low!
Binkowski: <i> Hold your line.</i>

<i> We're already drifting.</i>

Binkowski, keep an eyeball
on that high ground. Right.

Binkowski:
<i> Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.</i>

<i> Watch that tree</i>
<i> line right there.</i>

<i> Hold that, hold that.</i>

Davis: <i> Ride on, ride on.</i>
Hold tight.

We're gonna bust
through this shit.

Peterson: All right,
here we go, men.

Davis: <i> Left stick,</i>
<i> left stick.</i>
<i> What the fuck?</i>

<i> It looks perfect, Tim.</i>
Good?

Straight on, straight on.

Wardaddy: <i> Doughs on the</i>
<i> ground, doughs on the ground.</i>

<i> Keep an eye out.</i>

Straight, straight.
Over here!

Wardaddy:
<i> Gordo, slow, slow, slow.</i>

Gordo: We got bodies.

Stick left of me.
<i> Eyes on the floor.</i>

Get up.

Peterson: Fall in! Fall in!

Binkowski:
Straighten it out.

Binkowski: <i> You gotta</i>
<i> left stick now.</i>

All right, let's hold up.

If I say hold back,
hold back.
Hold back.

Left stick. Left stick.
What the fuck?
Come on!

Soldier: Company,
clear on the right.

Let's go,
let's go, let's go!
Clear it up and book it.

Peterson:
Speed up just a little bit.

Love 1-3, right stick!
Right stick!

You got troops
on the ground.

Davis: <i> Fuck, right stick!</i>
<i> Right stick, God damn it!</i>

Get your head
out of your ass!

They weren't fucking
paying attention.

Get in tight. Go!

(Indistinct radio chatter)

Down! Stay down! Down!

(Frantic shouting)

What the fuck is that?
Whoa!

Bible, hit that machine gun.

Traverse left, 800!

Steady!

On. Fire!

On the way!

Binkowski: <i> Good!</i>
<i> Hit them! Hit them!</i>

(Indistinct radio
transmission)

Look forward!
Look at your periscope!

Wardaddy: Bible,
traverse back. On.
Periscope!

Clear!
Fire!

On the way!

Wardaddy: <i> Cease fire.</i>
<i> Target destroyed.</i>


Soldier on radio:
<i> Roger, ester, Wilco.</i>

Fire!

Fuck! Anti-tank!
H.E.! Traverse left.

(Over radio) <i> Let's go.</i>
<i> Traverse left.</i>

Traverse left!

Peterson: Just a ricochet.
We're okay.

Bullshit! That's
a kraut high-velocity gun.
I can hear it whistling.

Peterson: <i> Anti-tank!</i>
<i> Left front, left front!</i>

Got it! Down 15.

Clear!
<i> Ready!</i>

Fire!
On the way!

Davis: 600.

Binkowski: Fire!

Coon-ass: Clear!
On the way!

Okay, cease fire, cease fire.
Target destroyed.

Fire!

There's another gun!
Who's got eyes on it?

Does anyone see it?

Eyes up, everybody.
Fire!

Binkowski: I don't see shit.

Where the fuck are you at?

Davis: <i> Anti-tank, h.E.</i>

Got it! Anti-tank, h.E.
Traverse right!

Peterson: Anti-tank.
Left front, left front. 600.

Davis: <i> Right stick,</i>
<i> right stick.</i>

On! Fire!

On the way!

Peterson: Hit 'em,
hit 'em, hit 'em.

Fire!

All tanks, start squirting
that tree line.

Davis: <i> Everybody squirt</i>
<i> the fucking tree line.</i>
Let's clean it up.

Hey! Hey!
Start shooting!

Norman: Well,
what do I shoot at?

The Nazis,
dumb fuck!

Wardaddy: That's it.
Keep their
fucking heads down.


Gordo: You got to reload!

Wardaddy: Panzerfaust!
Hey! Get him!

I'm loading the gun.
I'm loading the gun.
Hit him!

Got him.

Do your job!
Do what you're here for!

Wardaddy: <i> Machine gun,</i>
<i> twelve o'clock! Gordo,</i>
<i> run those bastards over!</i>

All tanks,
hold here, hold here.

Get your boys
in the fight!

Miles: Fall out!
Marching fire!


Come on!

Hey, squirt those
krauts on the left.

Do you see them?

Man: (Over radio)
<i> Will actual, come in.</i>
<i> This is vicious.</i>

<i> Krauts in the woods</i>
<i> to your...</i>

All I see are dead bodies.

How do you know
they're dead?
Are you a doctor?

Hit them!
But they're dead!

Why would I shoot them
if they're already dead?

So they don't stand up
and shoot us in the ass!

Fuck!
Get them!

Fuck!

I can't fucking be here
any-fucking-more!

Turn your goddamn
intercom off if you're
gonna bawl like that.

Gordo: I got it, top.

(Norman sobbing)

I fucking give up.
I fucking give up.
I can't be here anymore.

This ain't pretty,
you know.

This is what we do.

Wardaddy:
Boys, fight on foot.

You take it.

(Distant rapid gunfire)

I'm okay.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

you're all right.

Close your eyes, son.
Close your eyes, son.

Do you believe in Jesus?

You're all right, then.
You're all right, then.

I'm gonna pray with you now.

Our father,
lord in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day
our daily bread

and forgive us
our trespasses

as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

For the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
forever and ever, dear lord.

Amen.



I had the best bow gunner
in the entire ninth army
in that seat.

And now I got you.

I promised my crew
a long time ago
I'd keep them alive.

You're getting in
the way of that.

I'm sorry.

Okay, I am trained to
type 60 words a minute.

I am not trained to
machine-gun dead bodies.

I am trying my very best.

(Indistinct shouting)

Where'd you get
that U.S. army coat?
Where'd you get it? Huh?

Who'd you kill, boy?

Where did you
get that coat, boy?

Forgive me.
Let me go, please

dillard: Who did you kill?
What'd you do?

Don't shoot!

Let me go, please, let me go

who'd you kill, boy?
Wardaddy: Sergeant!

Back it up, boys!

Hold on. Hold on!

Back it up, boys.

Back it up, boys.

Wardaddy: Norman!

Get out here!

Norman, come here.

Come on, son.

(Speaking German)

Soldier: Huh?

I can't hear you.
Wait.

Wardaddy: Sergeant.
Call your dogs off.

(Speaking German)

I have a family

this is my wife, my children

shut your mouth

kneel

you are no goddamn
good to me unless
you can kill krauts.

Put a big fat hole
in his back.

Put a big fat hole
in his fucking back.

No.

Why the hell not?

It's not right.


"Not right"?

We're not here
for right and wrong.

We're here to kill them.

Why are you here?

You're here to kill him.

You know why he's here?

He's here to kill you.
(Speaking German)

He's here
to kill you, Norman.

He's here to rip your throat
out with a bullet.

Go to hell.


I'm trying to
teach you something.

You here to get me killed?

No.
You gonna get me killed?

No.

I need you to perform.

Just get it over with.
Just get it over with.

I can't do it.
Yes, you can.

I know you can.

He kills you,
or you kill him.

Simple math.

You or him. Pick.

Just kill me.
Come here.

Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me! Kill me! Please!

I can't do it!


Fucking stop!

Please stop.

Oh, no, no.
This is the easy part.

What the hell?

All right.
Fuck.

Please don't make
me do this.

Don't make me do this.

It's all right.

One, two...

(Sobbing, shouting in German)

Do it, Norman.
Do it, Norman.

Do it, Norman.



Do your job.

Soldier 1: Waddell,
where you at?

Waddell!
Soldier 2: Move it!

Move it!

Boyd: Come on, Norman.

Let's go.


<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

is this supposed to
make a man out of me?

Is this supposed to
make a man out of me?

'Cause my conscience is...

Sit down.
It's clean.

My conscience
is clean.

I'm keeping it
that way.

Look right here.
Hot coffee.

Norman?

Gordo: Don might be crazier
than a shithouse rat,
but he's solid.


We've been together
since before Africa.

I won't fight
with anybody else.

Boyd: Me, neither.

There ain't no crew
stayed together like
we have, Norman.

That's 'cause of him.


Coon-ass:
First time we got shot at,
down in north Africa,


Don, he done shit
his drawers full.

He stunk the tank up
real loud.

It's true.

We move out in 15.

Norman.

I haven't seen you
eat anything all day.

Make sure you get
something to eat.

(Distant rumbling)

You best go eat something.

Make sure
he sees it, too.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

there you go, boys.
Keep pounding them.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

Boyd: They got signs
around their necks.

What do them signs say?

"I'm a coward and
refused to fight for
the German people."

Gordo: The ss does that.

Let them rip themselves
to pieces, huh?

Fuck them.

Wardaddy: (Over radio)
<i> Baker 6. Love 1-6.</i>

<i> I got eyes on the town.</i>
<i> We're ready to</i>
<i> commence assault.</i>

Waggoner: <i> Baker 6 copies.</i>
<i> Initiate your attack.</i>

<i> Me and my boys will</i>
<i> hit them from the South.</i>

<i> Over and out.</i>

Wardaddy:
<i> We'll split up here.</i>
<i> 1-4, 1-3, you take left.</i>

<i> Binkowski, you follow me,</i>
<i> and stay off my ass.</i>

Come back.
Binkowski: <i> Copy.</i>
<i> I got you, daddy.</i>

(Indistinct radio chatter)

Clear the alley!

Miles: Keep moving, Tex.

Binkowski: <i> Go.</i>

Wardaddy:
<i> Gordo, just punch through</i>
<i> that wall of smoke.</i>

Gordo: <i> Copy.</i>

Wardaddy: Okay, hard left.
Nine o'clock, nine o'clock.

(Engine rumbling)

Move up.

Wardaddy:
<i> Gordo, halt, halt.</i>

Miles: All right, hold here.

Grandpa

where are the German soldiers?

Miles: Sniper!

Cover!

Get down!

Bible, follow my burst.

(Gunfire continues)

On the way!

(Men shouting in German)

Miles: Keep firing
on that window!

(Man screams)

(Gunfire stops)

Come on!
Move up!

Soldier: Go!

Miles: Keep moving.

Keep moving.

Come on, keep moving up.

Watch that doorway.
Watch that doorway.

Wardaddy:
<i> Halt, halt, gordo, halt.</i>

(Tank creaks to a stop)

Binkowski, see that
kraut stinger in the
cellar on my left?

Mind giving him what for?

I'm gonna slap him
around a little bit for you.

<i> Button up.</i>

(Men speaking German)

Binkowski: Hit him!

Fuck you, Jerry!

God damn.

All right, gordo, forward.

Fucking eyes up,
everywhere we go.

Wardaddy: <i> Gordo, hard right,</i>
<i> three o'clock into the square.</i>

<i> Binkowski,</i>
<i> you take the far end.</i>
<i> You cover our tail.</i>

Binkowski: <i> Gotcha.</i>

(Man shouts in German)

(Men shouting in German)

Anti-tank. Traverse left.

(Over radio) <i> Throw</i>
<i> some Willy Pete in</i>
<i> that ground floor.</i>

Clear, Boyd.

(Men speaking German)

Wardaddy: (Over radio)
<i> Fire when ready.</i>

(Man screaming)

(Men shout in German)

(Man yelling)

No, they cooking.
Go, go.

(Man screaming)


(Man shouting in German)

(Gunfire continues)

(Gunfire stops)

Good shooting, kid.
Keep stacking them up.

You should've
let them burn.

All right, look inside.

Check the doorways, y'all.

Wardaddy: (Over radio)
<i> Gordo, halt here.</i>

(Man speaking German)

Please stop shooting!

Come here

the soldiers want to surrender

we give up

the war is over

thank God

tell them to come out

with their hands up

Binkowski, load an h.E.

And get ready to put it
in that bank if these
people want to test us.

It's my pleasure.

(Man speaks German)

Soldier: Check the door,
check the door.

Fuck,
it's a bunch of kids.

Cut him down!
Separate them.

Come on.

Wardaddy:
<i> Here they come.</i>
<i> Keep an eye out.</i>

Right over there!

Let's go!

Go. Go.
Fuck.

Why you looking
so sour, kraut?
What you got?

You. You.

Wardaddy: Burgermeister.

Is he the one hanging kids?

<i> Ja.</i>

Hey.

Shoot that guy.

This guy?
Yeah, him.

The ss cocksucker
with the busted wing.

Oh-ho!

Hey, angel.
This one's yours.

<i> Auf wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

Motherfucker.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

whoo-wee!

(Indistinct talking)

Hey, you!
You're real pretty.

Binkowski: Yo,
what the fuck are you doing?

I'm-I'm gonna
take care of you, okay?
Okay.

You want to
see the tank?

Hey, I'm gonna
marry this girl.

Coon-ass:
It's gonna be for two.
Gonna be him, then me.

All right,
you go on up there.

That's it. Yeah.
Give me your hand.

Waggoner: You boys
all come through okay?

Just a walk in the park.
All right, sergeant.

You get some
rest and relax.

We'll go win the war
in the morning.

Yes, sir.

(Airplane rumbling by)

Norman.

It wasn't nothing, right?

Come again, sergeant?

Rubbing out those heinies.
You splashed them real good.

Wasn't nothing, right?

Sure, sergeant.

Yeah, it wasn't nothing.

Fact, I kind of liked it.

I want to show
you something.

(Glass clinking)

They knew
we were coming.

So they got drunk as
lords and they shot
themselves at sunup.

Why are you
showing me this?

Ideals are peaceful.

History is violent.

(Departing footsteps)

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(indistinct chatter)

Do what I tell you.

You do that,
you'll make it
through this thing.

Come on.

(Loud knocking)

(Plane rumbling in distance)

(Both speaking German)

Who is inside?

Just me

bullshit

(quiet whimper)

(Quiet whimper)


Watch her.

(Woman whimpers quietly)

(Speaking German)

Come out!

Right now!

(Woman speaking German)
Norman: Hey! Hey!

Come on. Calm down.

Stand fucking here.

Close the door
and lock it.

Lock the fucking door.

(Woman shuddering)

You said no one was here

you could have
gotten her killed

she's my cousin

I'm sorry

please

I was scared

sit down

(quiet sniffling, whimpering)


Bring me hot water

(quiet whimpering)

Go

(crying quietly)

(Woman crying quietly)

Put the gun down.

Grab a seat.
You make me nervous.

Come here

(gunfire in distance)

(Vehicle passing by)

What's your name, young lady?

Emma.


<i> Ja.</i>

(Plane rumbling by)

Mmm-hmm.

Hey.

(Quiet sigh)

(Lively chatter
continues outside)

Soldier: Fuck! Aah!
Grenade!

Get away from that window
before they shoot
the hell out of you.

(Lively chatter,
whooping outside)

Yeah! How was it, gor?
(Gordo laughs)

Gordo: It was good.
(Coon-ass laughs)

Coon-ass: You get
your ass up there, Boyd.

I hope you get scabies.

Coon-ass: Shit.


(Plane rumbling by)

(Playing on piano)

(Playing soft tune on piano)

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(singing in German)

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(stops playing)

Wardaddy:
She's a good, clean girl.

If you don't take her
in that bedroom, I will.

(Speaks German)

No

they're young

and they're alive

(speaks German)

(Sets cup down)

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

can I see your hand?
Can I see your hand?

I'm not gonna bite you.
This hand.

Yeah.

Now, you can tell
a lot about a person

from the lines
on their hand.

Um...

You don't know what
I'm saying, do you?
(Quiet chuckle)

All right, this,
you see that?

That's the ring of Solomon.

It means you help people,
you understand them.

It's really rare.

Really rare. You see?

You see that, though?

Yeah, I got it, too.

My grandma taught me
how to do this.

You see this right here?

That is your heart line.

you are going to have
one great love in your life.

(Norman exhales)

(Breathing heavily)


(Door creaks softly)

(Door creaks softly)

You don't have
to say a word.

(Footsteps approaching)

Sit down.
(Speaks German)

Thank you.

(Speaking German)

Hmm?
(Speaks German)

What's that?

(Speaking German)

It's hot.

Emma: "It's hot"? (Laughs)
Yeah, you just...

(Pounding on door)

Coon-ass: Normie! Nor?

Norman,
where could you be?

(Pounding on door)

Oh, shit.

Gordo: <i> Pinche</i> Norman!

Coon-ass: Norman?
<i> Pinche</i> Norman.

Coon-ass: Time for you
to act the man!

We got you
fixed up good.

Now, look,
there a special gal.

She's down there and
she's waiting on you.

And all you got to do
is come on down.

She wide open
just jump on in.

Yeah, she looks a little bit
like a whore, but...

What?

I think maybe
we too late, gor.

Norman.

What did you do?

Norman,
you sneaky snail.

What did you do?

Wait a second,
did you...

Did you...

Did you take this pretty
young thing for a roll?

Yeah, you're real pretty.

Coon-ass: Did you do that?
What's with your lip?

What's with your lip?
Why it quiver?

Don't worry about me,
I'm a friend.

He fuck you, you fuck me.
That how it works.

You got to
pass the plate.

Come on, make a donation
to the cause.

All right,
don't touch her.
Don't touch her?

Don't touch her.
Don't ever fucking
tell me what to do.

You think you get some
pussy and now you can
fucking act like a man?

Anyone touches the girl,
they get their
teeth kicked in.

Coon-ass:
That's how it gonna be?

Well, all right, then.

I guess
it's Norman day, huh?

Wardaddy:
Mmm-hmm.

Coon-ass: Shit, top.

It's your day, Norman.

You should drink that.

You best take a bite.

You a man, right?
Drink it.

Attaboy.
You did the nasty.

Drink it, there it is.

Your day.
(Shaky groaning)

There it is.

You like that?
Don't fucking touch me.

Don't touch you?
You a man, right?

Get some pussy,
you a man, right?

Get your fucking
hands off me.

Fucking piece of shit.

Watch this. How about
that? How about
I just kill you, huh?

How about I fucking
kill you right here?

Grady? Grady?
Hmm?

Fuck. Don't you
fucking speak...

Oh, God!

What the fuck is that?
Gasoline?

Taste like gasoline? Hey.

Ow!
Fucking north Georgia
right there, boy.

Fuckup.

Donkey.

Appreciate it.

(Plays note on piano)
Look at that.

(Slamming piano keys)

Go have a seat.

My beverage.

That's the girl's egg.

Boyd: That's gordo's egg.

That's the girl's egg.

Gordo: Then where the fuck
was my egg?

You want to say grace?

This meal's for you.

Roger.

Ready?

Gordo: Let's do it.

Our father,

thank you for preserving
our lives another day
on earth

so we may execute
your will.

Thank you for this meal
and this wonderful company.
Amen.

Others: Amen.

Emma.

Offer the girl her plate.

There you go. Oops!

Hold on.

Hang on, there.
I'm gonna fix that for you.

Let me just fix this
for you real quick.

I didn't touch her.


Switch with me.

Gordo: Y'all were gonna
eat like kings
and queens over here.

And we weren't invited.

I wonder why
we weren't invited.

Coon-ass: Guess
they too good for us.

I'm enjoying my meal, boys.

Gordo: Are you?
Coon-ass: Enjoying your meal?

And as much as you
want to destroy it,

you're not gonna
fucking stop me.

And neither will you.
No, sir.

And neither will you.

Hey, Norman.

Do you like horses?

Don likes horses.

Ain't that right, don?

(Gordo chuckles)

We're eating.

No, we're not.
I'm done.

I'm fucking done eating.
(Dishes clattering)

Gordo: Hey, in France,

we hit the beach
right after d-day.
(Silverware clattering)

Right?

And we had to fight
through all these
fucking hedgerows.

Fucking pain in the ass,
right?

We finally hit open country,
and we linked up

with the British
and the Canadians
and you know what we did?

You know what we did.

We trapped
an entire kraut army
pulling back into Germany.

We fucked them up.

Yeah.

Yes, we did.

There was dead
krauts and horses,

busted up tanks
and cars for Miles.

Miles.
Mmm-hmm.

Your eyes see it,

but your head can't
make no sense of it.

And we go in there...

And for three whole days,

we shoot
the wounded horses.

All day long.

Sunup to sundown,
just shooting horses.

And they were
some hot summer days.

I ain't never smelled
nothing like that, top.

Gordo: Do you know
how you kill a horse?

You pet it on the...

Pet it on
the forehead, no?

And it becomes your friend,
it goes like this.

And then you shoot it
right through the spine.

And the sound of it?
(Clears throat)

Those fucking
screaming horses?

Do you remember that, don?

All the black clouds
of flies just
buzzing around.

It was like being
in a giant beehive.

But you weren't there.


That was a real fine story.

Pleasant mealtime talk.
Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.

It is what happened, don.

What happened, happened.
What's gonna happen
is gonna happen.

Sitting here playing house
with a couple bitch krauts

ain't gonna change
a fucking thing.

Shut the fuck up.

Why should I shut up?

You shouldn't.

(Choking up)
I'm just drunk. I'm sorry.

(Door opens)
Man: Where's love 1-6?

Right here.

The old man wants you.

How come?
You got a mission.

(Man sighs)

Wardaddy: Let's go.

(Speaking German)

Where are you going?

To take the next town

and the next and the next

until you people quit

Norman: Do you have a pen?
I'll write you.

Y'all getting married?
Is that what
the fuck y'all doing?

This a fucking wedding?

Hurry up.
There are more of them.

What am I walking into?

A recon plane spotted
a troop concentration
moving west, here.

Battalion needs you to
guard these crossroads here

in this grid on the overlay.

How many troops did he see?

I don't know.

What kind of troops?

They have tanks,
horses, artillery?

I wish I could help you.
He took fire,

he got the fuck
out of there.

Enough to spook the colonel.

All the tanks are
driving on Berlin.

There's a couple
of thousand cooks,
mechanics and doctors here.

Those krauts hit them,
it'll be a slaughter.

All we got is you.

We need you
to the crossroads
fast as you can.

Secure them.
Don't stop for anything.
You understand?

Take my gas if you have to.

If those troops
get past you,

they're gonna smash
into the supply train.

Then the whole
division's fucked.

All right, sir.
We're on the way.

Is that gas?
Open it up.

Yeah, it's good.
Okay.

Soldier: Incoming!

Boyd: Grady,
jump, jump, jump!

(People screaming)


Boyd: Grady, you up?

You good?

Boys, good?

Gordo: Thank
the krauts for that.

Binkowski?

Davis, good?
Boyd: Grady!

Soldier: Everybody up!

Boyd: You up?

Coon-ass: I'm up.

(Indistinct shouting,
chatter, coughing)

All right, let's get
an aid station right there.

Wardaddy: Check Peterson.
We're gonna mount up.
Boyd: Norman!

Norman: Emma!
Coon-ass: I got him.

Emma!

Fuck.
Who do you think
you are, huh?

Jesus Christ?
(Norman grunts)

Fuck!

You gonna raise
her up, Norman?

Get your ass back
on the fucking tank.

Fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck
are you doing? Huh?

What the fuck is
wrong with you?
What you gonna do?

You gonna get mad?

You don't feel anything?
You piece of shit!

That's it, come on! Come on.
Fuck you!

You feel it?
Fuck you!

It's called war!

You feel it?


Get your fucking spindly ass
back on that fucking tank!

Where the fuck
you think you are?

Oh, God, why?

Wardaddy: Tankers, mount up!

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

you see that?

That's an entire city
on fire.

I started this war
killing Germans in Africa,
then France, then Belgium.

Now I'm killing
Germans in Germany.

It will end.

Soon.

But before it does,
a lot more people got to die.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

fuck! Reverse hard left!
Hard left!

Reverse!

Fuck!
Wardaddy: Back up, back up,

Peterson: (Over radio)
<i> Hatches! Hatches! Back up!</i>

<i> Go, go, go!</i>
Davis: <i> Let's go,</i>
<i> let's go, let's go!</i>

<i> Back up. Left stick.</i>

<i> Go, go, go! Hard stick!</i>

What the fuck was it?

Wardaddy: <i> That was an 88.</i>

It's a goddamn tank.

Where the fuck is it?

Tank! 12 o'clock,
800 yards.

I see it!
It's a goddamn tiger!

<i> Put some fucking</i>
<i> smoke in his face!</i>

Boyd: Let's go, grady.
Smoke up, grady.

Smoke's up! Clear!
On the way!

We have to get
to the crossroads.
We got to get past them.

Don, let's get the fuck
out of here! Let's go!

Unless he drowns himself
in a shit-filled ditch,

he's our problem.

Hit that son of a bitch!

Almost up!
<i> Light the bastard!</i>

Clear!
On the way!

Davis: Shoot that fucker!

Wardaddy: <i> Fire when ready!</i>

Wardaddy: <i> Roy's gone.</i>

We're all that's left.

<i> It's up to us now.</i>

(Man speaking German)

Driver halt!

Wardaddy: Gordo,

Put us on his backside.

<i> If we get behind him,</i>

Don't let him behind us!

Wardaddy: Faster, gordo!

(Man speaks German)

(Man speaking German)

Forward


Target 2 o'clock!

God damn it! Fuck!

What was that?

We got hit!
Boyd: I lost it.

Coon-ass: Boyd,

Norman: Aw! Shit!
Gordo: Fuck!

Boyd: We lost power traverse.
Switching to manual.

Coon-ass: Boyd,

Bible, hit him!
<i> On the way!</i>

Coming around!
He's coming around!

<i> Gordo, you got</i>
<i> to outrun that gun!</i>

Oh, I got it! I got it!

German soldier: Fire!

Wardaddy: <i> Gordo, put it</i>

Bible, put it up his ass,
where the armor's thin.

I know where to
fucking hit him!

Coon-ass: Boyd, you're clear!

Boyd: On the way!

Shit!

Wardaddy: <i> God damn it,</i>
<i> I said in the ass!</i>

We're moving too fast!
It's not that fucking easy!

Coon-ass: Come on,
Boyd, stay on him!

Gordo, when I say
back up, you back up.
Left stick.

All right, all right.

Bible, stand by.
I'll call the shot.

Roger! Roger!

Gordo, now! Reverse! Reverse!

Coon-ass: Clear!

Wardaddy: <i> Gordo, halt.</i>


(Shouting in German)

Fucking Nazi fuck!

Fuck you!



(Continues panting)


Wardaddy: Radio check,
love 1-6.

Yeah, boy.


Wardaddy: Radio check,
love 1-6.

Norman: Fucking handed him.

Good fucking job, gordo.

Wardaddy: Radio check,
love 1-6.

Radio check, love 1-6.

(Radio static)

Radio's eighty-sixed.
We're on our own.

Good shot.

Oh, it wasn't me.
No, no, I'm the instrument,
not the hand.


God didn't call us today.

You hear me, boys?

What's he
doing up there?

Big pair of dice?

Everyone else came up
snake eyes but us?

Lord's protection.
Coon-ass: We got it,
don't we, Boyd?

Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
We got it.


Norman mowed
them fuckers down,
didn't he, too?

Good job, Norman.

Welcome
to the army, norm.

You did good.

Oh-ho-ho!

(Others chuckling)

Coon-ass: Best job
I ever had. (Laughing)

Best job I ever had.

Best job I ever had.

Best job I ever had.

Gordo: Shit.

We're still open for business.

Let's head out for
those crossroads,

keep it out of krauts' hands
like we've been told.

There's a wave
coming in. We're the rock
to break that wave.

<i> Vamonos.</i>

Gordo, get us out of here.

Fuck it.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

wardaddy: All right,
there's the crossroads.

Gordo, take us up
on that hill.

We can cover the whole
valley from there.

Boyd: Grady, get down!


Shit! Not another
fucking tiger!

A mine.
Where's it coming from?

Where?
Settle down. It's a mine.
We hit a mine, is all.

Whew!

Everybody off.
Grady?

Yeah, I'm off.

Shit.

Wardaddy: How bad is it?

It's broke as fuck.
Busted a bogie, too.

Wardaddy: Can you fix it?

Yeah, why not?

(Gordo speaking Spanish)

(Coughing, groaning)

All right, Norman,
you and coon-ass
check out that building.

Get my Thompson.

What?

Go get the Thompson.

Boyd: Gordo!
Gordo: Yeah?

You got that rope bag?

Right here.

You can put
the gun down, Norman.
Ain't gonna do nothing.

(Flicks lighter open)

Can we go now?

Norman, I'm sorry. You know?

I think...

I think you're a good man.

It's what I think.


I think maybe we ain't,
but I think you are.

See, I just...
I wanted to tell you that.

It's okay.


Come on, let's go.

Anything?
No, nothing.

It's an aid station.
They all dead.

Wardaddy: Kid.

Head up top of that hill,
near those trees.
You got outpost guard.

Can I grab my canteen?

Yeah, you can
grab your canteen.

Norman!

Top of the hill,
then work your
way from the trees.

(Wind blowing softly)

(Wind blowing softly)

(Birds squawking,
wind whistling gently)


(Men singing in German,
marching in distance)

(Singing,
marching growing louder)

(Soldiers continue singing,
marching)

(Singing continues)

(Singing continues)

(Singing continues)

Hey! Hey!

Good evening, Norman.
Why aren't you
at your post?

Slow down.

They're coming right now.
Who's coming?

The Germans!

How many?

Too many.
Too many to count.

How many?

Oh, about two,
maybe 300 of them.

They got vehicles, too.

Tanks?
No, no, no, just trucks.

Coon-ass: Probably a bunch
of bums looking to
surrender, that's all.

Norman: No. No, no, no.
They were marching,
they were singing.

Coon-ass: What do you mean,
they were singing?
Boyd: Where?

Norman: I'm telling you.
Right over there.

(Faint singing in distance)

Hey, you hear that?

It's a goddamn
ss battalion.

Bullshit.

Jesus Christ.

Grady, get my gun.
Yeah.

You want to get
the weapons?
Shit.

What do you want to do?
Let's just get
our shit, all right?

Look, it's about to be
dark. We just get on up
out of here, huh?

Let 'em pass on through.
Boyd: Let's him them woods.

Coon-ass: Norman, go get
your shit. Go get your pack.

Let's go.

We never run before,
I ain't running now.

What was that?
We're gonna fight it out.

We can't.

I'm gonna hold
this crossroad.

What you mean,
you're gonna hold...
The tank's busted!

The tank's
fucking busted, top!
Hey.

Yeah, you said that.
Top, what are you doing?

What do you want to do?
You want to sit here?

I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
You want to sit here

and hold off
a ss battalion...

No, it's not what
I want to do, but it's
what we're doing.

There's five of us...
Get to your fighting
positions! Mount up!

What you mean
fucking fighting positions
when we ain't got a tank?

How we gonna fight?

We got a Cannon!

Gordo: Don,
that don't make sense!

Stop! What are you doing?

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

get out of here.
Get to that tree line.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

boys, take care
of yourselves. Get
to that tree line.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

it's all right.

Hmm.

It's all right.

It's my home.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

I'm staying here with you.

All right.

I'll need you to load.

Boys, get on.
It's all right.

Grady, come on.

We're gonna stay.

Uh-huh.

What is your plan?

Fuck it.

Get us one of
them dead krauts.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

light him up.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

coon-ass: You wanna
take that kit right there.
That's it.

Go and grab it. That's it.
Norman: All right, all right.

Grease gun.

Go on, hand it to him.
Another box.

Coon-ass: Go ahead
and get it ready. Listen,
you do not waste one shot.

You hear me?
Wardaddy: Gordo.

Boyd: Grenades.
Wardaddy: Ammo count.

Boyd: Put that there.
Coon-ass: Make them count.

What kind of rounds
you got up there? Norm?

I only got two.
All right.

Ready?

Coon-ass: That's it. Yeah.

Norman: I'm going through
ammo like water.

That's four rounds of smoke,
and 23 super charge
and 33 solid shot.

What you want, top?
Load super charge.

Set the point delay.

Boyd: Norman, get it ready.

Coon-ass: That's it.
Here we go, Boyd.

Coon-ass: Gordo,
grab me that one.

Boyd.
Thank you.

Norman: Give me that can.

Might as well
get a little tight.

Won't be around
for the hangover.

Ah...

God, that's better than good.

Mmm.

Give it here.

Give it here.

What you gonna do with that?

I'm gonna drink it.

I know you hate me
preaching. I know it.

But what we're doing
here is a righteous
act, gentlemen.

You hear me, gordo?
Mmm-hmm.

You know,
there's a Bible verse
I think about sometimes.

Many times.

It goes...

"Then I heard
the voice of the lord saying,

"'whom shall I send?
And who will go for us?'

(clears throat)

"And I said,

"'here am I.

"'Send me.'"



book of Isaiah, chapter six.



Yeah. Yeah, don.

That's exactly right.
Oh, wow.

You're something.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(low grunt)

God damn, son.

You a fighting, fucking,
drinking machine, ain't you?

Machine, that's it,
that's his war name.

That's perfect.

Wardaddy: I christen
thee "machine."

Machine!
Machine!

Machine!

Machine!
Yeah.



(Panting quietly)

Wardaddy: I love it in here.

I do.

Best job I ever had.

Coon-ass: Best fucking job.

Yeah.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

they're coming.

Wardaddy: No one makes
a move unless I say.

Come on,
you cocksuckers,
come on in.

(Speaking German)

(Continues in German)

(Continues in German)

Wardaddy: Come on in.

Almost.

(Shouts in German)

Come on in. Hey, come on.

(Soldier speaking German)

Wardaddy: Fire!

On the way!

Clear!
On the way!

(Soldier shouting in German)

(Shouting in German)

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(shouting in German)

Fucking Nazi. Fuck!

Wardaddy: They're running!
They're running!
Traverse left!

Bow gunner, squirt
those assholes running

Cut those fuckers down!

Loader, four rounds

That was beautiful.

On the way!

Wardaddy: Bow gunner,

Yeah, you better fucking run.

(Shouting in German)

Traverse right!

(Indistinct shouts)

Bible, stay on 'em.
15 up, 15 up. Fire!

Coon-ass: Clear!
On the way!

Wardaddy: Traverse right!
Doughs, two o'clock!

Give 'em a big
kick in the butt!

All right, I'm on them.

You're clear!
On the way!

Loader, give me another
point delay. Skip it on
the ground.

Bounce those fuckers!

Clear!
On the way!



Hit 'em again!

Go, boys! Go, boys!

Grady, grady, grady,

Coon-ass: Clear!
Light 'em up!

On the way!

Down 15. Steady.

Traverse left!

Coon-ass: You clear!
Wardaddy: Fire at will!

Boyd: On the way!

That's right,
burn to the fucking ground.

(Shouting in German)

Machine, clock one!


I'm out!

I need a new can!

Shoot, we out! We out!

Fuck. We got a case rupture.
This gun is gone.

Norman: We need more
boxes of ammo!

We got .30
on the roof.

All right,
we got ammo outside.

I'm gonna lay
down some smokes.

Gordo, on my signal,
pop your hatch,
lay down some cover fire.

Okay, Roger.
Wardaddy: Machine,
you do the same.

Grab that grease gun.
Copy.

Cover right! Bible,
get ready to snatch that .30.

Roger.

All right, here we go.

Go!

(Shouting in German)

They're outside the tank!

Pick them off!

Coon-ass: Come on, Boyd!

Take it, grady.

(Speaking Spanish)

(Shouting in German)

Move up!

Button up!

(Soldier shouts in German)

(Gun clicks)

(Soldier shouting in German)

Quick, quick, quick!
Gordo: Hurry up, grady!

(Wardaddy grunting)

(Soldier yells)


Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Aah, fuck!

Gordo: Shoot him, Bible!


Boyd: Gord? Gordo?

Gordo: Grady,
I need two more.

I got two left.

They're getting cocky.

Coon-ass: Fuckers.

Damn sure ain't no good
leaking oil everywhere.

So patch me up, then.

Gordo: Hey,
take these two boxes.
Put 'em down below.

Hey, grady, come on.
Keep it coming.

Norman: All right.
Open the other one for me.

If a man loves the
world, the love of
the father's not in him.

For all that's
in the world,

lust of the flesh,
lust of the eyes,
pride of life

it's not of the father.
It's of the world.

The world and its
desires pass away.

does God's will is
gonna live forever.

Forever.

(Artillery fire in distance)

Lift it up.

(Shouting in German)

Swarm and kill them!

Make them count!

They're all we have

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

wardaddy: Save your ammo.
Don't shoot unless
you see something.

We can be damn sure they're
working their way behind us.

Anybody see anything?
Gordo: I see nothing.

I got nothing.
Nothing.

(Soldier speaking German)

Advance, advance quickly

panzerfaust, four o'clock!

Gordo: He missed!
Hit him with the coax!


Fuck!

Boyd: Grady. Hey.

Fuck! Fuck!

No. No. No.

Hey, grady...

Wardaddy: Get up!

We're still in this fight!

We're still in this fight!

Watch our right,
watch our right.


Stay on the .30.
Keep hammering them.


(Shouts in German)

Yeah, you motherfuckers!
Come on.

(Shouts in German)

How long can we keep this up?

Come on, keep shooting!

Fuck, I'm out! I'm out!

I need a new can!

Boyd: That was our last belt.

She's out!

That's all there is.

Fuck!

Fuck.

Wardaddy: Don't get your
panties in a bunch.

We still got hand
weapons and the .50.

(Labored breathing)

Who's with me?

(Speaking German)

They're running low
on ammunition!

Finish them!

This is our land!

Attention!

Move out!

(Continues speaking German)

Wardaddy: Gordo?

They're everywhere.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>


<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>


(Groans, pants)

I'm sorry, son.

Uh...

It's okay.

What can you do?


<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

I did my best.

Yeah.

I know. I know.


<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

(muted, distorted explosions)

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

sergeant Collier?

Yeah, son?

(Norman panting)

I'm scared.

I'm scared, too.

<i> Â¶ Â¶</i>

oh, Jesus.

Oh, fuck,
I want to surrender.

Please don't.

They'll hurt
you real bad.

Oh, fuck.

And they'll kill you
real bad.

Fuck, what do I do?

There's a hatch.

Okay. Okay.
