 [birds chirping]

Our pretend patient of
the day here is Kendall.

Welcome.

And Kendall is in
desperate need of an IV.

You guys will be doing
IVs so many times a day,

I kid you not, you'll
start dreaming about it.

So, who wants to give it a try?

 - [Woman] I will.

 - Okay, last chance.

 We leave for Cabo tomorrow.

 - I can't.

 - Come on, it's spring break.
 We gotta get outta this cold.

 - I have papers I
 need to catch up on.

 - Boring.

Come on, just promise me
that you won't stay here

the whole time.

 Use that train ticket that
 your dad got you and go home.

 - He's the last person
 that I wanna see.

 - Pivotal.

 Isn't it, Scarlett?

 - Yes.

 Generally between a 14
 to 25 gauge depending

 on the age and size
 of the patient.

The 25 gauge is
typically for children.

 - Moving on.

 Embolisms.

This was in the reading,
so you should know it.

 - Sell the train ticket
 and go somewhere fun, then.

 - I could, but I'm
 just gonna stay here.

 - $11.74.

 - [Natasha] Will you
 just think about it?

 [card reader beeps]

 - Is there something wrong?

 - Yeah, it's saying
 it's declined.

 - Oh, um...

 Let's try this one.

 [card reader beeps]

 - Yeah, no, it's not working.

 - Um, okay.

 I'm sorry.

 - That's, that's
 not enough money.

 - [Man] Would you hurry up?

Yeah.

 - I have some cash.

 - Thanks.

 - [Costumer Service Rep]
 Your call is important to us.

Please hold on the line.
It's not a big deal.

 - I know I have enough
 room on my cards.

 I'm gonna pay you back if I
 can ever get off hold here.

 - Don't worry about
 it, seriously.

 Or we can just do something
 fun and call it even.

Dancing. Let's do that.

 - [Customer Service Rep] Card
 services, how may I help you?

 - Hi, hi, I'm here.

Oh, good, so it's not...

The cosigner froze the account?

 How do I unfreeze it?

He has to do it.

 Okay.

Uh, fine, yeah.

 All right, thanks.

 - Everything okay?

You know what?

 Dancing sounds great.

Yeah?
Yeah, why not?

 - [Natasha] Okay.

[plane whirring]
[dramatic music]

[Woman] Please proceed
to the exit where a bus

 is waiting for you to
 take you to your aircraft.

[plane whirring]

Yeah.

 No, definitely. Of course.

 No, I promise I'll be there.

 Yeah.

 Got him.

 â™ª You're so bad

 â™ª Feeding me lies I
 can't believe in â™ª

 â™ª Just so you can get
 the satisfaction â™ª

 â™ª In taking me on
 your rollercoaster â™ª

 â™ª Now I can see
 your dark exposure â™ª

 â™ª I'm trying to love

 - Come on, just let it go.

It's just that this a
whole new low for him.

 - I don't see why though.

 - He wants me to come home.

 - Just tell him there's no
 way you're gonna do that.

 - Well, that means
 talking to him.

 This. This is his
 way of forcing me.

 - Wow, I thought
 my dad was crazy.

Oh, there are degrees.

Mine is beyond.

[Natasha sighs]

 - Just forget about it then.

 â™ª I let you trust me, I've
 been played before, a fool â™ª

Wait.

 â™ª I made the choice
 and I can't a cure â™ª

 â™ª But you're still

 â™ª Did you pick up like that

 â™ª Oh, I gave you my arm but

 [both laughing]
 â™ª You only push me down

 â™ª Right down

â™ª What a way right now

â™ª Don't wanna lose you

â™ª But you're dragging me down
Hey.

 I'm Liam.

 - Hi.

 - This is for you.

Oh, thanks, I'm good.

[chuckles] That's a
little light, isn't it?

 Hey, come on, just
 give it a try.

I promise you're gonna love it.

 It's got an umbrella
 and everything.

 - Hey, you mind if
 we join you here?

 - Oh, not at all, not at all.

 This is uh-
 - Not interested.

 [men laughing]

 - Feisty.

 - So, this is Nick, Kayden,
 - Hey.

 - And Matthew.
 - Sup?

 - Can I have my water back?

 - [Liam] Sure.

 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 - Wait.

 There's no need to run off.

 - I'd like to go.

[Liam] Please, just sit down.

 - You boys have a good night.

 [men laughing]

 - Come on, just
 tell us your name.

Yeah, you all have had
too much of something.

 Just leave me alone.

[men chuckling]
Hey, hey, hey.

No one should be alone.

 Stay. I promise you things
 are gonna get better.

I doubt that.

 - Hey, come here.

 Come here.

You did good.

 Officer said there
 was four of 'em.

 You defended yourself.

Stop.
What?

 Come on, it's not like you
 killed them, they deserved it.

 - That's not what the
 police report says.

 It's their word, four
 of them, against mine.

 - Doesn't matter.

Yeah, it does.

 I used a sleeper
 hold on one of them.

 I could've killed him
 and it's your fault.

 - I mean, what if you didn't
 know how to defend yourself?

 - Dad, stop.

 Stop.

 I didn't just defend
 myself, I'm the freak

 who leveled four guys
 without a scratch.

 I mean, who does that?

 - I mean, you know
 I'm not mad, right?

 - No.

 You're proud.

 What type of parent are you?

 Oh, and you froze
 my credit cards?

 Did you think that was funny?

 - You've been ignoring
 me for months.

 - I'm having you removed as
 a cosigner on my accounts.

 - I wanted to see you.

 - Now you've seen me.

 Take me back to campus now.

 - Come on, it's your spring
 break, you're going home.

Well, I have studying
I need to catch up on.

 - Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

Look, we're going home,
it's been too long.

 - No, not long enough.

 [Cal sighs]

 - Hey, Scar.

Hey, we're home.

Come on.

 [door creaks]

 [alarm beeps]

Change the code again?

 [Cal sighs]

[Cal] Hungry?

 I'll fix you something to eat.

Oh, Scarlett.

 Hey, you want some cereal?

I could make you something else.

 [cereal rustling]

How'd you sleep?

Fine, I guess.

 [Cal sighs]

 [Scarlette groans]

 - Um, milk's bad.

 [Cal groans]

Sorry, I've been out of town.

Yeah, I can go out later
and get some groceries.

So, how was your trip?

 Business good?

 [Cal chuckles]

Reminds me, I got
you a little something.

 Consider it a late
 birthday present.

[paper rustling]

 - Really?

What?

Feel it, the weight is amazing.

 Blade.

Sharp.
Yes.

 - What am I gonna
 do with this? I...

What about clothes or gift
cards, just something practical?

 - No, I mean, it's special.

 - To you.

I'm gonna go for a walk.

 - Do you want me
 to come with you?

 - No.

 - Remember what I taught you?

[dramatic music]
[gun clicking]

 - Dad?

 - [Cal] Don't waste
 time calling anyone.

 Go right to Grandma's
 house, you got it?

 - What about you?

Dad!

 - What's Grandma's address?

Again?

Humor me. What is it?

 - 19 Boarcrest Road in
 Cayhill, wherever that is.

 - You can look it up.

 And what's it for?

Can I finish the show?
Scarlett.

 - If there's ever an emergency
 you'll tell me to go there.

 - That's right, and
 you'll wait for me

 until I get there, right?

 - Why do you call
 it that when I don't

 have any grandmothers left?

 - It's exactly why
 I call it that.

 We'll be safe there
 in case we need it.

 - [Boy] Better not
 scare the fish away.

 - [Cal] Come on, keep up!

 How are you ever
 gonna outrun somebody

 if you get in trouble?

 - [Scarlett] Or I
 could call the police.

 - Hey!

 We talked about that.

 - You know, you're the
 only parent who encourages

their daughter not to dial 911.

 - Okay, well, if you're hurt
 or if there's a fire, yes,

 call them, but if it's
 another dangerous situation

 just protect yourself
 and get away.

 - Yeah, because you don't
 like the questions like,

 "Hey, Dad, where'd
 you go last week?"

 - You know I can't
 talk about that.

Yeah, all I'm allowed
to know is you work

 for the government
 and carry a gun.

 Fine.

 How's Syria this time of year?

 - Come on, cut it out.

 - What, you can't
 stop me from watching

 the news and guessing.

 - Scarlett.

 - Okay, I get it.
 Don't call the police.

 Whatever.

 - Good sprint!

 - Who is this?

 - [Man] I'm the man
 who has your father.

 - I wanna talk to him.

 - [Man] And I bet he's dying
 to talk to you, too, Red.

 I'd love to reunite
 the two of you,

so, do me a favor, just
sit tight, all right?

 We'll come pick you up so
 you can see your father.

 [man spits]
 [Scarlett grunts]

Where's my dad?

I'll tell you nothing.

[hand slapping]

I'm gonna rip your hair
out and make you eat it.

 [heavy breathing]

 [suspenseful music]

 - Last chance.

 - Careful, don't hurt
 yourself with that.

 You won't shoot me.

 [suspenseful music]

 - Don't tempt me.

 [thudding]

 [light dramatic music]

 - That's it.

 Hands up, a little
 more here, okay.

Good. It's a little
more comfortable, right?

Okay, good, you remember
what we talked about?

 Both eyes open at all
 times, aim, breathe evenly,

time your shot with your breath
for better accuracy, right?

Okay.

 - Okay, good.

 [gun clicks]

Fire when you're ready.

 [gun bangs]

I had plans, you know.

Guy with a stud in his tongue?

 Who knows where else?

 Come on, that is not plans.

 - Okay, well this?

 This is probably going
 to get me in trouble

 just like everything else.

Okay, but not if you
know what you're doing.

 Come on, this is
 quality bonding time.

 - Okay, well we do
 this a lot more than

 I get to go out and
 do normal things.

 - Okay, well this, this here.

 [gun bangs]
 [metal clinks]

 Makes me cool dad
 of the year, no?

 - You're way out of touch
 with what I think is cool.

 - Ah, this is great.

 The grouping's fantastic.

 If you keep this up-

 - I don't wanna keep it up,

or keep coming here and
being someone I'm not.

 - Why, stop it, Scarlett.

[Scarlett sighs]

 - Keys, Dad.

 - Hey, I know this
 is unusual for you.

 - You think because I can
 shoot at a pinned up target

 I can, what, shoot a person?

 Why would I even want
 to shoot someone?

 - You don't know what you
 might have to do someday.

 - Why do you want this for me?

 - [Cal] To keep you safe.

[Scarlett sighs]

Gee, at least I'm not
locked up in the house,

 get to see sunlight.

 Awesome.
 - Okay, cut it out, Scarlett.

This is not easy for me.

 - What isn't?

 - Raising you.

 Being a father, being
 away, worrying about you.

Look, I wish your mother
was still here, okay?

 But you are stuck with me.

 - No, you worry about me
 but you're gone on and off

 3/4 of the year, so...

 If you're so worried about
 me why don't you just remarry

 or get a girlfriend
 to check in on me?

 - It is too late for that.

 - It's too late
 for a lotta things.

 - Look, I don't trust anyone.

 Okay, not like that.

And I'm not gonna risk bringing
someone into our lives.

 - I thought you were a
 decent judge of character.

 Why don't you just
 quit your job?

I mean, wouldn't that be
better for both of us?

 No more secrets, no more me
 not knowing what you're doing

 and you worrying about me.

I'm good at what I do.

 Someone's gotta do it.

 - So let someone else do it.

 - Well, no matter what
 I do I'm not gonna

stop worrying about you.

 I'll drive. Get in the car.

 [dramatic whooshing]

 [light dramatic music]

 - [McDowell] Get up.

 [man groans]

 - Where's Walker?

 [man sighs]

 Sweet.

 [phone beeps]

[phone ringing]

 - [Man] The girl?

She got away.

 - [Man] Interesting.

Walker's dead.

[Man] You underestimated her.

 Get back here, I
 have another option.

Okay.

 [man sighs]

Help me with the body.

 [suspenseful music]

 [engine rumbling]

 - [Cal] How do you tell when
 someone's following you?

What?

 - How do you tell?

Dad, not now.

 - Come on, you
 check your mirrors.

If you see the same car they're
gonna turn when you turn.

 - We are just going
 out to dinner.

 - And they'll try
 and match your speed.

I'm a little old for
a driving lesson, okay?

 - This is important.

 - That's what you always say.

 - Come on, what if you
 have a stalker boyfriend.

 How you gonna tell
 if he follows you?

Should've just ordered pizza.

[dramatic music]

 [light dramatic music]

 Follow too closely
 and you'll be seen.

 [engine rumbling]
 [light dramatic music]

 Just because he speeds up,
 doesn't mean I have to.

If he speeds up
suddenly, he spotted me.

 Please, I told you
 everything I know.

 - [Oloski] It's just
 not good enough.

Let's see if you can
remember anything else.

 - [Man] No, no, no, come on.

 - [Oloski] Where's the vial?

 - I don't know.
 - The cetus virus.

 - [Man] I don't know.

 I don't know.

 - [Oloski] Serious question.

 - [Man] What?

 - [Oloski] How well
 can you tolerate pain?

[man screaming]

Stop!
[dramatic music]

 Put the gun down.

 Put it down, both of you.

 You, too.

Back up.

Back up!

Are you lost?

 - Dad?

 - Dad?

[dramatic music]
[man panting]

 Is that your dad?

 [light dramatic music]

 - Let him go.

 - Yeah, yeah do that.

 - No.
 [gun bangs]

[Oloski groans]
[dramatic music]

 - Don't move.

 Don't move.

 - Who are you?

 - Where's my dad?
 - What?

Cal, his name is Cal.

Hey, look out.
[gun banging]

Move!
[dramatic music]

 Go!
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 - This way!

[dramatic music]

 [gun banging]

 [heavy breathing]

 - Now what?

 - I'm still figuring it out.

 - What do you mean
 figuring it out?

 What kind of rescue is this?

 - I wasn't planning
 on rescuing you.

[gun banging]
[dramatic music]

 [suspenseful music]

They're still on the property.

 Find 'em.

 - Here, here, passenger side.

 [door thudding]
 [engine rumbling]

 [heavy breathing]

 - Hey, thanks for the uh-

Yeah.

 - You know, the
 saving me and stuff.

 I'm Sean, by the way.

 - Scarlett.

Hey, Scarlett.

 Hey, is Cal your dad?

 - Have you seen him?

No, no, he's just, no, nuh uh.

 I think they have him
 in maybe another place

 or something.
 - Where?

I don't know.

 - You must!
 - No.

 No, I don't know where he's
 at, I haven't heard anything.

 Sorry.

Yeah, I just...

 I think the bleeding's
 slowing down, but it stings.

 - You okay?

I don't know.

 Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine.

 [light dramatic music]

 [Sean groans]

 Nice.

 [bag rustling]

Here.

Start with this.

 - Thanks.

 - How do you know my dad?

 - I got him some information.

 - [Scarlett] How?

 - Some illegal ways
 that may or may not

 have involved code
 on the internet.

 You know what he does, right?

Yeah, I have an idea.

 - Well, I got him
 some information about

 a biological weapon that
 was being sold as a virus.

 Something those guys
 called this weird name

like Cetus or something.

 Anyway, Cal went after it.

So what are you, an informant?

[Sean chuckles]

 - Something like that.

 - And those guys?

Guessing arms dealers.

 - And how did they get to you?

I don't know.

One moment I'm chilling
drinking a coffee

 and the next they
 grabbed me and...

 You're the last person I
 expected to show up, though.

 You know?

 - Who were you expecting?

 [Sean groans]

I don't know, maybe
some of Cal's associates

 or another agent or something.

 Actually, I wasn't expecting
 them to take him down.

 - What do you mean?

 - I mean, I don't mean
 down, I mean find him.

I didn't know, I passed
on some information

 that must've been
 enough to track.

 - You told them about my dad?

 - I didn't have a choice.
 - That was you?

 - I didn't have a choice!

 - They came after
 us because of you!

 - I'm sorry, I...

 I'm not all trained
 in this sort of thing.

 I'm a little in
 over my head here.

 - You're gonna help
 me get him back.

 - Ow, oh!

 Come on.
 - You owe him.

 - I owe him?

 He got me into this.

 - I thought you were the
 one who told him about it.

 Besides, you betrayed him,
 you put him in danger.

 And me, too!

 Now you're gonna
 help me get him back.

 - I hate to break it to you,

 but this intimidation
 thing you do is much better

for your dad than it is for you.

You're holding a 50 cent
bandage over my head.

 Very convincing,
 I've changed my mind!

 [Sean sighs]

 - Here, let me... let me see.

 All right.

 It's not that deep.

 - [Sean] It's not?

 - No.

All right, just apply pressure.

 Yep, right there.

Okay, thanks.

 [light dramatic music]

 - Did you see him at all?

 - No.

He's tough, though,
he'll survive, you know?

 - I'm the only one
 looking for him.

 [light dramatic music]
 [birds chirping]

 Train station is up ahead.

 - Yeah, it's good, you can
 just drop me off right there.

 [engine rumbling]

 [brakes squeaking]

Here.

 This might not draw as
 much attention as...

 - [chuckles] Yeah, thanks.

 - Yep.

 - You know, you should run.

 I would, I am.

 - That's your choice.

 - Yeah, okay.

 You know, maybe this
 virus thing these guys

 are looking for is the
 thing that Cal has.

 Maybe it's your ticket
 outta here, you know?

 You find it and trade
 it for him and...

 - Unless it's labeled
 deadly virus I don't know

 what I'm looking for.

 Besides, if it's
 that big of a deal-

[sirens wailing]

[Scarlett sighs]

 - How are you gonna find Cal?

 - I'll figure it out.

Look, if I had any information
I would totally help-

 - It's fine.

 It's fine, I get it.

 - I mean, I owe you one,
 you know, for everything.

Don't worry about it.

[sighs] Okay.

 [light music]

 [door thuds]

 [Sean sighs]

[head thudding]

I must be crazy.

[light music]
[birds chirping]

[door squeaking]

 [bag rustling]

 Safe house, nice.

 - Something like that.

He has got everything.

 Whoa, are those grenades?

Hey, has he been here recently?

I don't know.

 - Well, maybe it's
 here, did you check?

Wouldn't he of handed
it off to somebody else?

 - [Sean] Well, it depends.
 Let's look around.

 - It's a biological weapon,

 I have no idea
 where he'd store it.

Well, those guys were
asking a lot about Cal,

 how well I knew him.

 They talked like he
 knew where it was.

 For some reason they think
 he still has it somewhere.

 - Well, it doesn't do me
 any good if I can't find it.

 - Well, I can help you look.

 I mean, it's cool. We
 can find it together.

 - Okay.
 - All right.

[light music]
[fire sizzling]

 Your dad's got issues.

 [book thuds]
 Ooh.

 I am willing to open
 this up just to see

if Cal stashed anything inside.

 - We don't have time for that.

 - Yeah, we do.

I need food. I haven't
eaten for like two days.

 Here.

My dad is missing and-

 - Eat.

 So, you work for your dad?

 - No.

 - You just know how
 to handle yourself

 in case a date gets
 handsy or something?

 - My weekends were different
 than most growing up.

 [dramatic whooshing]

 [fists thudding]
 [Scarlett grunting]

 - [Cal] Tired?

 - No.

 - You're lagging.

 Excellent, that's it.

Come on.
[fists thudding]

 [Scarlett grunting]
 Come on.

 Good, good, keep
 it up. That's it!

 Come on, one more of them.

 - Take it back, I am tired.

[Scarlett sighs]

 - Come on, five more minutes.

Come on.

[sighs] Okay.

 - What's on your mind, huh?

 - Nothing.
 - Humor me.

[fist thudding]

 What is it?

 [fist thudding]
 [Scarlett grunting]

Have you ever killed someone?

 - I can't talk about that.

 - It figures.

[fist thudding]

Why do you wanna know?

 - I think I should, don't you?

I mean, what are you
always training me for?

 - Not to kill.

 - Really?

 [Cal sighs]

When it comes down to
it, of course I want it

 to be the other guy, but
 this is for your protection.

Right.

 - [Cal] Good, good.

 - You haven't
 answered my question.

Well.
[fists thudding]

 [light dramatic music]
 [Scarlett grunting]

 Control, control.

 Hey, hey, hey. Calm down!

 [heavy breathing]

 Yes.

 [light music]

 - How many?

I won't tell you that.

Doesn't it bother you?

 - Not as much as it should.

 [dramatic whooshing]

 - Your dad never
 told me about you.

 - I didn't think
 you two were close.

 Besides, isn't everything
 super secret all the time?

 - So it's just the two of you?

My mom died when I was eight.

 - [Sean] From his job?

 - What? No.

 She got sick.

 - So he raised you.

 - If you call it that.

What about you?

What about me?

 - Well, I know
 nothing about you.

 Other than you've
 worked with my dad.

 - Well, I grew up under less
 than ideal circumstances.

 Had a few run ins with the law

 'cause of my computer skills,
 but I turned out okay.

 Pretty good at
 gettin' outta scrapes.

 [chuckles] Well, I
 mean, everybody's

 got their off day, right?

 I'm more of a
 information middleman.

It's how I met your dad.

 I thought it would
 be a safer gig.

 [light dramatic music]
 [birds chirping]

 [rustling]

 Whatcha doin'?

 - I'm making a deal.

I'm telling them we'll
get them what they want.

 My dad for the vial.

[phone clicking]

 Or I'm going to the police.

 [phone dings]

What's it say?

You have until tomorrow night

 or we're dropping off
 his body for the cops.

 [light dramatic music]

 [engine rumbling]

 - Were you expecting somebody?

 [suspenseful music]

 - That car, it was
 outside the house.

 - It's them, it's gotta be.

[dramatic music]

 [thudding]
 [heavy breathing]

Finger off the trigger.

Right.

 - Don't point it at my face!
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Oh, god.

 What do we do, what do
 we do, what do we do?

 - Shut up!

[dramatic music]

 [door clicks]

 [suspenseful music]

 [heavy breathing]

 - Freeze, don't move!
 [gun clicks]

 Right there behind the couch.

 - I see 'em!

 - Drop the gun, put your
 hands where I can see 'em.

What do we do?

 - [Man] Let me see your hands!

 - Put it down.
 - Show me your hands!

 - Come on!
 - Put the gun down!

 I'm not gonna tell you
 again. Put it down!

 - Okay, okay, okay.
 [suspenseful music]

 [Scarlett panting]

[dramatic music]

 - Get down.
 [guns banging]

Take cover, now, now!
[dramatic music]

Come on, out the back!
[guns banging]

Don't stop, keep moving.

 Get down, get down.

 [gun banging]

 - Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

 [gun banging]
 [gas hissing]

 [Sean groans]

 - Oh shi-
 [booming]

 [fire crackling]
 [light dramatic music]

[fire sizzling]

 [heavy breathing]

 - You okay? You all right?

I don't know.

Oh jeez, you're hurt.

Hold on.

Hold on.

Here, here, put this on.

Yeah.
Who were they?

 - Those are the guys
 who got your dad.

How did they find us?

I mean, I told them I'd
get them what they want

 and then, and then
 they attacked.

 Does... does that mean
 they killed my dad?

No, no, no, don't think that.

 [heavy breathing]

 - Those men.

 Those men are dead.
 [somber music]

 - [Sean] Yeah.

 - Pull over.

 Pull over.
 - Okay, okay, hold on.

 [engine rumbling]

[Scarlett pukes]

 [somber music]

I got you, I got you.

 You okay?

Okay.
Oh.

Listen, listen, listen, listen.

[Scarlett cries]
You did exactly

 what you were supposed to do.

 Those guys were gonna kill us.

 - I know.
 - Yeah.

 You know what else?

 You did what Cal
 would want you to do.

Yeah.
Yeah.

 You know what?

 He saved my life
 actually one time.

 - He did?

Yeah.

 Yeah.

 I was in Dublin and I was
 supposed to meet these guys

 who ended up not being who I
 thought they were gonna be.

 I figured that out
 a little too late.

And I got away, but I got shot.

So, there I am, I'm on the run.

 I literally have no idea what
 I'm doing, so I call Cal.

 I didn't expect him to
 pick up or to do anything

 but I was running out
 of options, right?

But I remember one time
he told me, he said,

"I owe you one."

 So that was me hoping
 he'd come through.

 And he did.

What happened?

 - So, he tracked me
 down and I'm literally

on the stone floor of
this old chapel, right?

 And I'm looking up at
 the barrel of a gun

 and I'm thinking to myself,
 "All right, this is it."

 And then Cal shows
 up and he saves me.

 And he said it was by
 luck that he was in London

and he was close enough
he could, you know,

 get to me before
 they [grunts], right?

 He didn't have to
 show up, but he did.

 He patched up and he
 told me I was an idiot

and then he got me outta there.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.

My dad had a lot of last
minute trips growing up

 and it was never a good
 time and I never got a say

in his staying or going.

 I hated it.

 But, uh...

 I'm glad he was there.

 - So you guys weren't close?

 - Not lately.

What changed?

 - It just got to be too much.

 [dramatic whooshing]

 - Look, I got you
 into a great program!

Don't act like you're
doing me a favor!

You stuck me in a
subpar community college

 that was close to you.

 - It's a little tricky
 right now, okay?

I don't want you halfway
across the country!

 - But that's your
 life, not mine!

 Do you know how hard
 I worked to get into

 the nursing track at school?

 The studying and the midnight
 cramming in a cadaver lab

just so you could screw
it up with your job!

 - It's for your own good.

 - Sure, Dad.

 Then why not let me
 stay at the university

that has a great
reputation that I worked

 very hard to get into?

 - Because somebody might...

It's complicated, okay?

It's just better to keep
a low profile right now.

Great.

 So, you transferred
 me without asking

 and I don't even get
 to know the reason why

other than it's for my own good.

 [Cal sighs]

 - Will you go?

 - I'll go.

But I'm done after this.

 I'm not coming back.

 [Cal grunts]

 - Scar...
 [sighs]

 [dramatic whooshing]

 - What if they're watching?

What?

 Well, you told them you're
 looking for it though, right?

Then they attacked us.

 - That's a good point.

 But they still
 might have your dad.

I just hope it's here.

 This is the only other
 place I know where to look.

 - [Sean] Yeah, well.

 - Thanks.

 I mean it, thank you.

 - Oh, yeah, no, no, it's cool.

 I'm glad I'm here.

 Hey, we'll be careful.

Yeah.
Yeah.

 [door squeaking]
 [light dramatic music]

 [door thuds]

 - I'll check in here.

 - Yeah, I'll check down here.

[glass crunches]

 [suspenseful music]

 [Sean sighs]

 [Sean sighs]

 [blankets rustling]

 Anything?

 - Nothing yet.

[paper rustling]

 My dad brought me back a gift.

 - [Sean] Oh yeah?

 What was it?

 - A knife.

 - Your dad got you a knife?

 - Yeah, he thought
 it was special.

What if it was?

 - Where is it?

 - I don't know, I
 mean, it was here

 before they attacked, but...

 Maybe they have it.

 - No, if they have
 it they wouldn't

 come looking for it, right?

 - I'm gonna look in my room.

 [light dramatic music]

 - [Sean] Anything?

Still looking.

 [suspenseful music]

 - [Sean] Haven't
 found anything here.

[dramatic music]

 You okay?

[dramatic music]

[glass clinking]

Come on, Red, have you found it?

[dramatic music]

 - [Man] I'm the man
 who has your father.

 - I wanna talk to him.

 - [Man] And I bet he's dying
 to talk to you, too, Red.

[dramatic music]

 - No!

Not yet!

 Try, uh...

Try looking in the
drawers in the kitchen.

 [light dramatic music]

 - Whoa, whoa, whoa,
 whoa, what are you doing?

 - Don't move.

 - Wait, did I miss something?

 - You're him.

 - Who?

On the phone.

You have my dad.

 - Scarlett, put the gun down.

 Put it down.

 All right, now
 think this through.

 Think, think, think.

 [dramatic music]
 [Scarlett grunts]

Come on, this is not how
I wanted this to end.

 - Where's my dad?

 - He's alive.

 Where is the knife?

 - Get off me!

You need to calm down.

 Where's the knife?

I trusted you.
[somber music]

 - That was the idea.

 - Why?

 Why pretend?

 - Well, because your
 father wouldn't cooperate

 and I have buyers, so I needed
 you to find the virus for me.

 - Is he alive?

 - Technically.

 [glass shattering]
 [dramatic music]

 [Sean groans]

 [heavy breathing]

 [engine rumbling]

 God!

 [engine rumbling]

 [Scarlett panting]

 [light dramatic music]

 [suspenseful music]

 - Did you get it?

 [suspenseful music]

 [thudding]

 [Sean yells]

 [thudding]
 [Cal groans]

 [heavy breathing]
 [thudding]

 - [Sean] Jeez!

 [heavy breathing]

 [light dramatic music]

 [muffled talking]

 [muffled upbeat music]

 â™ª I could ever want

 â™ª Next to me

 [light dramatic music]

 [suspenseful music]
 [glass clinks]

 â™ª Bad lies

â™ª Get me high

 â™ª So get me

[phone ringing]

 - Scarlett.

 You must miss me.

 - I'll trade.

 - [Sean] Oh, good.

 I thought there'd be some
 hard feelings between us.

 - I want my dad back unharmed.

 - [Sean] Come get him.

You don't have any other
choice, we both know it.

 - I wanna talk to him.

 - [Sean] Nope.

 - How do I know he's okay?

 - Well, ask me a question and
 I'll get the answer for you.

 - What type of dress did
 he buy me when I was eight?

 - What type of dress did you
 buy her when she was eight?

 He never bought you a dress.

 - You try and pull anything,
 I swear I'll put all

 my weight into making you pay.

 - What? With all
 90 pounds of you?

 Come on, enough with
 the threats, Red.

 - Don't call me that.

 - Oh, okay, that's
 right, that's...

 That's how you figured
 me out, wasn't it?

Where do I go?

 - Hey, uh, were you in
 Lehrman's class today?

No, I wasn't.

 - I'm lost on this
 lab assignment.

Sorry.

 Good luck.

 - Looks like I got a date.

 Let me ask you something.

Did you know the whole
time where the virus was

or was it just luck that you
got it before I could steal it?

 That was cold, man.

 Planting it on your daughter,
 something so dangerous.

 Wow.

 Oh, wait, oh, you didn't know.

 [laughs] Oh, you didn't know?

 Yeah, the virus was in the
 knife you gave your daughter.

How she figured it
out, she's a smart kid.

Beautiful, too.

 Let me ask you something.

 When she gets here, would
 you rather that I kill her

 or that I keep her?

 [light dramatic music]

 [Scarlett grunts]
 [heavy breathing]

No needles this time?

[doors thudding]

 [suspenseful music]

 - Where's my dad?

 - Scarlett.
 [light dramatic music]

 - Dad.

 - You shouldn't of come here.

 - Red.

 - Let him go.
 - Where is it?

 - It's in the bag.

 [bag rustling]

[zipper buzzes]

 In the handle.

[glass clinks]
[dramatic music]

Good.

 So, have you figured
 out who those men

 at the cabin were yet?

 Hey, don't tell me you
 haven't thought about it.

 [suspenseful music]

 'Cause they weren't mine.

What?

 - Yeah, no, I figured
 maybe they were your dad's

 colleagues or maybe a handler.

 [light dramatic music]

[paper rustling]

 - Don't listen to him.

 - But you...

 - I was what?

 Good to you?

 I was, right?

 We shared some tender moments.

 I can't help if
 you're that gullible.

 - Come on, leave her alone.

You have it now, so I'm
taking my dad and we're leaving.

 - Oh, oh, oh.
 [gun clicking]

 No, I know you are
 not stupid enough

 to think that's gonna happen.

Don't.

 - Don't what? You
 have no leverage.

 [suspenseful music]

 [grenade beeping]

 [booming]

 What was that?

Go, go, go, go!

 - [Man] We're on it.

We need to act now fast.

[Sean] Where'd that come from?

[Man] I think the north side.

[grenade beeps]

 - Bomb!
 [booming]

[dramatic music]

 [Scarlett grunts]

 [heavy breathing]

That was you?

 Cute.

You could let her go.

 - Shut up!

 [suspenseful music]

 Tie 'em up in the other room!

 [light dramatic music]

 [heavy breathing]

 - You shouldn't of come here.

 - And where else was
 I supposed to go?

 How long was I supposed to
 hide while you were missing?

 - I'm sorry.

 - You're hurt.

 - Oh, don't worry about that.

 The virus, we can't let him
 walk outta here with it.

 - I know that.

 - Okay, well, whoever he
 sells it to is gonna use it.

 - It's not the cetus virus.

 - Okay, well,
 whatever it is I can't

 let him walk-
 - It's not a virus at all.

 [light dramatic music]
 [phone ringing]

[Girl] Hello?

 [liquid trickling]

 [light music]

 - Nice job.

 - Oh, he'll figure it out.

 - [Cal] Okay, then
 we'd better hurry.

 Where's the real one?

 - Somewhere safe for now.

 We probably don't
 have much time.

 - What are you doing?
 [both grunting]

I have a razor blade.

 You had one in a
 book at the cabin,

 that's what gave me the idea.

 [muffled talking]

They're right outside the door.

 [light dramatic music]
 [muffled talking]

[knob rattling]

 It's locked.

 [light dramatic music]

 - [Cal] Scarlett.

 [Scarlett grunts]

Gonna hear you.

 Scarlett.

 - [Scarlett] We gotta
 get out of here.

 - Cut me loose, we'll
 figure something out.

 [Scarlett panting]

 [light music]

Come on.

 [footsteps tapping]

 - Hurry up, hurry up.

[phone buzzing]

 Yeah?

Yes, I have it.

 I'm still waiting for the
 first half of the transfer.

No, I will meet you
when I get confirmation.

 Fine.
 [phone beeps]

 - Those men who
 died at the cabin,

 what Sean said about them.

 - Don't listen to him.

 - But he wasn't lying, was he?

 [Cal sighs]

 You knew them.

 And I killed them.

 - You didn't know what
 was really going on.

 [somber music]

 - [cries] I'm sorry.

 - Hey, it's not your fault.

Who were they?
Don't.

I'm the one
responsible here, okay?

 - Stop trying to
 make me feel better.

Look, I'm not.

 Look, this job, it screwed
 up your life enough as it is.

 - I never should've said that.

 - Why not? It's true.

 I used to think I
 protected us enough and...

 I should've never
 put you at risk.

[dramatic music]

 [men groaning]

 No, not me.

 My daughter.

[dramatic music]

 [microscope clicking]

 - [Sean] What?

 - It's not biological.

What?

 - I think...

 I think I'm looking
 at sugar water.

 - Get ready, here they come.

 [light dramatic music]
 [door squeaks]

[dramatic music]
[fists thudding]

 - Look out!

 [thudding]

 Scarlett, get the gun!

[dramatic music]

 Scarlett!

 [thuds]
 [man groaning]

 - Let him go!

 I said let him go.

 [suspenseful music]

 [man laughs]

Move.

Move it, get over there.

 - No, no!

 - The real vial
 is here somewhere.

 Where is it?

 - You have it.

 You have it, just
 let me and my dad go.

You know, it's funny.

You keep bargaining for
him and two days ago

 you would have me
 pull the trigger

 to get him out of your
 life once and for all.

 - That's not true.

 - Oh, that's cute.

 You made peace with
 him then? Good!

 [gun bangs]
 [Cal groans]

 [high pitched ringing]

 Stop playing games!

 There's no safe
 place to stash it,

 so you woulda kept it
 close just in case.

 [suspenseful music]

 [gun clicks]

You have five seconds
to tell me where it is,

Red, or he dies.

Don't.

 - One.

Don't do this.

 - Two.

 - The moment you tell
 him we're both dead.

Three.
Sean, please.

Four!
Stop!

 It's outside.

In the car, I...

I hid it inside the car.

 - Show me.

 Watch him.

 Let's go.
 [suspenseful music]

 Where? Where?

 - In the back.

 In the trunk.

 [thudding]
 [light dramatic music]

 - Sit.

 Sit.

 - Come on, show me. Show me!

 Do you want me to
 bring Cal down here

 and kill him slowly
 in front of you?

 Where is it?

 - It's with the spare tire.
 [suspenseful music]

 - Okay, get out,
 get out of the way.

 Get it now!
 - Okay, okay.

 [suspenseful music]

[dramatic music]

[both grunting]

 You don't wanna shoot
 your own daughter.

 It's over.

 Drop the gun.

 [suspenseful music]

 I will kill her, is
 that what you want?

 Drop the gun!

 - Remember what I taught you.

This won't look good
with the assault charges

from earlier this week.

 - [Cal] Don't worry about it.

[Officer] Everyone, stay back.

 - [Scarlett] You can't bail me
 out if they arrest you, too.

 - Excuse me, we'll
 take it from here.

 - You.

 Alive.

Good to see you again.

 - [Man] You as well.

 - You're...

And next time, careful
what you shoot at.

Sorry.

Let's get you outta here, sir.

 - [Cal] All right, thanks.

 [light dramatic music]
 [sirens wailing]

 - You got hit.

Yeah, it's...

 [light music]

 [muffled talking]

 Hey.

 - Hi.

Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah.

 - This looks good.

 - Yeah, it kinda does.

How's your leg?

 - It's fine.

 Stitches itch.

 - Don't scratch it, okay?

 It's gonna make it worse.

 Just keep it covered.

 - Yes, Nurse Scarlett.

 Well, the realtor called.

 She's got some decent
 options this time.

 - Remote enough for
 Grandma's new house?

 - Off the beaten path, yet
 close enough to the city.

 - You know, we could
 keep the old one.

 - Too risky.

 Maybe you wanna come take a
 look at some of the new ones?

 - I have an exam.
