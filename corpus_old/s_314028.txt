Get ready for yard.

[Man 1] Fuck you!
[Man 2] What's his name again?

[Man 3] Fabrizio.

[Man 4] He's some
kind of tough guy, man.

Ready for yard, gentlemen.

[Gate buzzing]
[Guard] Gangway!

Yard line.

[Guard 1] Come on, let's bail out.
[Guard 2] Gangway! Move it!

Move out!

[Prisoners shouting]

[Indistinct chatter, shouting]


Go in and out, man! In and out!


Fuck 'em up, man!
Come on, feed me, man!

Fuck you!


Always good!
[Laughter]

You're just a little punk, baby.

<i>[Man] The morning it all began,</i>

<i>began like any other morning.</i>

[Children shouting]

[Birds chirping]

[Dog barks]

Oh! Oh, Bernie.

[Water running]

Dad, I need lunch money
and a note for gym.

And you promised to help me
with my book report, remember?

[Whines, barks]

<i>[Man talking on radio]</i>

The author devotes a lot of time
to developing the characters,

and he seduces the reader by...

Seduces?
Yeah. He, uh, draws you in, you know?

You wanna know how it ends.
But I already knew how it ended.

OK, so write it was predictable.

No, Dad, I mean I've seen the movie.
Oh. Right.

Come on. You got to eat.

Can't you think of another word?

"Intrigues."

"Intrigues." Thanks, Mom.

You're smarter than Dad, you know that?

Yes, God help us if he finds out.

If Mom's so smart, maybe she
should help you with your book report.

See what I mean?

I have a meeting, Dee.
Yeah, I have meetings too.

Amy, your book report, your call.
Me or him?

I choose option C
where you two get me a tutor.

<i>- Yep. We've been through this.
[Phone rings]</i>

<i>- Oh, jeez.
[ringing continues]</i>

Where is it?
It's over there.

<i>- It's the hospital.
[Ringing]</i>

<i>- Yep?
[man] Is this Mr. Schine?</i>

Speaking.

<i>I need to know
if Amy's levels have changed.</i>

<i>- No. No, the levels are the same.
We need the latest results.</i>

Yep.

I'll fax it over when I get to work.

Thanks.

You going to the ATM?

Who wants to live forever, right?
You have to stay positive.

At least it's not going up.
It's not going down, either, though.

Positive.

Amy, your bus'll be here soon.

[Mother] Bye.
[Dog barks]

Bernie, you stay here.

You used to kiss each other
goodbye in the mornings.

Shut up.

Come on.

The author intrigues the reader

by twisting the narrative

so you never know what's coming next.

How's that?

It's all right.

<i>[Man over PA] The train on platform two
is the 7:50 Red Line service</i>

<i>to Chicago Central.</i>

<i>Calling at Central Street, Davis Street,
Main Street, Rogers Park,</i>

<i>Ravenswood, Clybourn
and Chicago Central.</i>

[Indistinct chatter]


Oh, shit.

I meant to get one at the station.
Nine dollars.

Oh, gee. This is embarrassing.
And it's only Monday.

My wife, she, uh, emptied my wallet
when she left for work this morning.

Oh, so it's the wife's fault, is it?

Yeah. I'm trying to explain.
It's nine dollars.

Pay up or get off at the next stop.

It's that simple.

[Woman] I'll pay for him.
What?

No, no. You don't have to do that.

Don't worry about it.

One lucky guy.

No, really. It's my fault.

It's all right. I paid, didn't I?

Here you go. Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Just so you know,
it wasn't an act or anything.

It was a shameless act,
and I'm a born sucker.

Just drop it.

I don't want you to think...
OK. I don't.

I mean, there's an ATM
at Union if you're getting off there.

Tomorrow is fine.

Of course, there is a ten percent
interest charge overnight.

Interest charge.
Plus the handling fee.

Ouch.

Never met a woman loan shark before.

You break legs too?
Just balls.

Oh. You're a lawyer.

I'm a financial advisor.

I cheat clients.

I'm a commercial executive.

I con housewives.

Where do you work?

JMD/March. It's a midsize place.

We've got some
semi-decent accounts. You?

Avery Price. It's a big place.

We don't do semi-decent accounts.

This your usual train?
Why?

So I'll know how to pay you back.
Nine dollars. I think I'll survive.

No, I gotta give it back.

I'd feel ethically impugned if I didn't.

Impugned?

Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel impugned.

So... if you take the same train
tomorrow, I'll pay you back.

It's a date.


Morning.

Hey.
What up, Chaz?

Ooh, yo, I got a good one for you.

Seven players, 40-plus home runs,

with 11 letters in their last names.

Yastrzemski.
Yastrzemski.

You got to spell that for me.
Morning, Charles.

Y-A-S-T-R-Z-E-M-S-K-I.

Barry, I need a cash check.

How much and what for?

12,000. Location fee
for the Amerispend One shoot.

the receipt this time.

For you, Barry, I'll sign it in blood.
[Barry] Heard that.

OK, that's one. I need six more.

Um... [clicks tongue]

Petrocelli.
Petrocelli?

Oh, Charles. Eliot's looking for you.
P-E-T-R-O...

Oh, come on, yo.
That's only ten letters.

What else you got?

Come on, Chaz,
you got 'em all last week. I need this.

Oh, gee.

All right, Winston,
any of these guys National Leaguers?

I thought it was Major League or Minor
League. What's the National League?

You don't follow baseball?
No. Hockey's my game.

More gore, less bore.
Where'd you get the questions from?

This cop I know gives 'em to me.

Actually, he's like my uncle.

He's obsessed. Loves challenging me.

Said if I get it right, I get 100 bucks,

and you know I gots
to make that money.

Wait. You don't know the answers?

No. Duh.
That's why I come to you, Chaz.


Where you been? You're late.

Come on.
Sorry.

This is not a lady
who likes to wait, you know.

Susan.

Charles.
Hi.

I guess you're here
to raise our commission, eh?

We have some issues.

We feel like no matter
how much we talk to you,

we just don't get heard by you people.

This last commercial
is a case in point.

We agreed on a strategy.
We signed off on it.

Then what happened?

You went off
in all these other directions.

The cut you sent us, it's nothing
like how we said it should be.

Look, Susan, the directions
I took were, you know...

I've been doing this for ten years, OK?

I'm sorry.

I'll do it however it is
you want it done.

The time for apologies is over.

What we need now is change.

You don't want me on the account?

Uh, Susan appreciates all you've done.

You have different visions.

<i>[Phone rings]</i>

You might have backed me up in there.

Backed you up!
Susan Davis is a $130 million client.

She's a bitch.
She's the worst kind of bitch.

She has a point. You're in a rut,
my friend, and you know it.

Forget Susan Davis.

Get a new account, get back
on your feet, back to what you do best.

Goddamn it.

Talk to me, tell me what's going on,
maybe I can help.

Impugned.

That's a word, isn't it?


<i>[Rap music playing on stereo]</i>

[Dog barking]

I live here. Amy, please!

[Barking]
Bernie, cut it out.


You're late.
Sorry.

How was work?

Work was...

...fine. You?


Guess who's decided
to monitor me this week?

Ethan Jeffries.
Oh. The asshole.

He always throws a fit
when I stray from the lesson plan.

There's a lot of that going around.

So, what did I do?

Handed out an English composition
in the math hour today.

He chew you out in front of the kids?

The title for the composition
was "Why We Like Principal Jeffries."

[Car horn honks]

Uh, Jerry called.
There's a message on the machine.

Where you going?

I have a PTA meeting.
It's been on the calendar for six weeks.

Right.
[Bernie whimpering]

Amy needs to be quizzed
for her history test,

and Bernie needs to pee.

[Bernie groaning]

Name the act that banned alcohol.

<i>- [rock music playing]
Volstead Act.</i>

What year?
1919.

Huh?
1919.

Yeah. Do you think we can turn
this down a notch below deafening?

Amy!

OK.

<i>[Music turns off]</i>

<i>[Beeping]</i>

How long...?

<i>[Rock music playing]</i>

How long did Prohibition last?
Fourteen years.

[Door opens]

[Door closes]

[Charles cries softly]

[Train's whistle and bell]

[Train's whistle and bell]


Hey.

I looked for you.

Yeah, right. Gimme my money.

Really. I did.

Is that your daughter?
Yeah.

Amy.
Oh.

Mine's a few years younger.

What's her name?
Amber.

Oh, she's adorable.
Yeah.

They make it all worth it, don't they?

Nice briefcase.

It was a gift... from my wife.

Oh, jeez. Guess I should
get one for my husband, huh?

"If lost, please return
to Charles Christopher Schine."

Charles Christopher Schine.
Isn't Schine a Jewish name?

Rabbinically.
Christopher Schine.

My mom was Catholic.
I got all kinds of guilt.

Oh. How's that workin' out for you?

Fine. I had a lot of therapy
when I was a kid.

You're kinda funny, aren't you?
You're an easy crowd.

What's your name?
Lucinda.

Lucinda Harris.

So we came here when I was little,
just me and my mom.

We were only gonna stay a year.
Mm-hm.

How about you?
Oh, all over.

I was an Army brat.
I grew up everywhere and nowhere.

My address changed every six months,

and so did my best friend.

But, then again, I got to change too.

If I screwed up in Fort Hood, Texas,

they didn't have to know about it
in Saratoga, New York.

I could just be this whole other person.

That happen a lot? You screwing up?

Mm-hm. Yep.

I was the consummate rebel
against authority.

Oh, is that what you called it?
No, that's what my parents called it.

I called it gettin' lit.

But then I got my act together
when I got out of school,

and Dad really wanted a lawyer.

He settled for a banker.

<i>[Man over PA] The next stop

<i>This is the end of the Red Line.</i>

<i>All passengers,

<i>Thank you.</i>

Busy day?

Oh, in finance, every day is a busy day.

Oh, I bet you're getting a lot of angry
calls with an economy like this.

Well, if you consider
death threats angry.

Tell me about it.

Clients, they love you
when times are good...

No, no, no, when times are good,
you never make them enough money.

There's always some cousin
or brother or grandmother

whose stock split 64 ways,
and why can't you sell 'em one of those,

like I got some
crystal ball or something.

Tell me about it.
I got fired off my biggest account.

My boss didn't even warn me.
Supposed to be a good friend of mine.

That bastard.
Do you want me to yell at him for you?

Give me his number,
I'll crank-call him.

Some people just don't know how
to appreciate what they've got.



[Winston whistles]

What up, Chaz?
Hey.

You all right?
You look a little sick in the face,

like you got the bug.
No.

It ain't contagious, is it?
It's nothing.

That's what Dick Lembergh said.
Who's Dick Lembergh?

Ain't nobody now.
That motherfucker dead.


Winston.

Come here. Let me ask you something.

This about the computers?
No, no.

I appreciate what you did for me.

Forget about it. Buy me a beer sometime.
This is something else.

Go ahead. Shoot for it.

Say you went to the movies,
but you forgot your money,

and someone offered
to buy your ticket for you.

In Chicago?
I'm just saying, hypothetically.

It's only right
to talk to them, isn't it?

I mean, thank them.
Show you appreciate it somehow, right?

This full price or matinee?

That's the difference
between five or ten bucks, man.

You know what?

Never mind.

Hey, yo. I asked that cop
about those questions,

and three other players
were National League.

I'm still working on that.

I need those answers
by tomorrow to get that moola, baby.

We're cool about the computers, right?
Yes, Winston. We're cool.

Chaz.

We're cool about the computers, right?


<i>[Ringing]</i>

<i>[Woman] Avery Price.</i>

<i>- Lucinda.
You mean Lucinda Harris?</i>

Yeah. Could you tell her
it's Charles Schine?

<i>I'll put you through to her office.</i>

<i>- [Lucinda] Charles.
Hey.</i>

We have this beautiful house
in Lake Forest,

just the kind of house
I dreamed about as a kid.

What's your husband do?

He golfs.
For a living?

He wishes.

No, he's a broker. We met at Stanford.

He's up at 3am so he can be
in the offices when London opens.

We also have an apartment in the city.

He stays there during the week
to avoid the commute,

and of course,
the weekends are for golf.

So when do you see each other?

The usuals.

Birthdays, Christmases.

We communicate mainly via Hallmark.

But hey, I have a beautiful,
wonderful baby girl, so there.

<i>[Beeping]</i>

<i>[Crashing sound, fast beeping]</i>

[Amy moaning]

Deanna!

Amy. Amy!

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me, sweetheart?

Breathe. Breathe, Amy.

Breathe. There you go.

Daddy's here. It's OK.

Everything's OK. Daddy's here.

There you go.

There you go, sweetheart.

Stay with me.

There you go. There you go.

It's OK, sweetheart. It's OK.

Shh.

Amy. There you go.

It's all right, baby.
There you go.

Diabetes?
Type 1. Worst kind.

We took out
a second mortgage on the house

to get her one of those
mobile dialysis machines

so she doesn't have to go
to the hospital every day.

Can't they, um...?
Can't they give her a new kidney?

They have. Three times.

Her body keeps rejecting them.

There's this new anti-rejection drug
coming out, supposed to be amazing.

Has to be approved,
but they say it's got a 99 percent rate

of success in the tests so far.
Expensive?

Like you wouldn't believe.

And, of course,
insurance won't cover it.

Sure. Probably cheaper
to let her suffer, right?

We're OK.

We've been saving for years.

So now we just sit around
and wait for the call.

<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

Hi. Amy, don't let Bernie out.

<i>[Charles] Hey. You home?</i>

Yeah, just now. What's wrong?

<i>I just got out of Eliot's office.</i>

<i>He slammed me
with some big new account.</i>

<i>I'm gonna be home late,
so, uh, don't wait up.</i>

All right. How come you're
calling from your cell phone?

<i>Amy, your bag's in the back.</i>

I don't know.

I'm just down the hall and wanted
to let you know as soon as possible.

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.
It's been kind of hectic lately.</i>

Um, I gotta go.

<i>All right. See ya.</i>

Bye.

Yeah. All right, honey.


[Bernie barking]

[Dance music playing]

Excuse me.

Same again?

I'm drinkin' you under the bar, mister.

Really?
Yeah.

I bet I can do it in three drinks.
You like to gamble?

It's not really gambling
when you never lose.

I got a bet.
Really?

I'll bet you $20

that I can kiss you
without ever touching your lips.

Kiss me?
Without touching.

How?

What do you mean, how?
That's the bet.

OK. Let me see the 20.

Worth every penny.

What are we doing?

I've never done this before.

Me neither.

All the years I've been married,
never lied to my husband.

Not once.

Bartender! Johnny Walker Black Label,
no ice, please.

Excuse us, please.
Oh, there she is. Hello, beautiful.

Can I buy you a drink?
I have a drink.

Can I buy you the bar then?

Do yourself a favor, buy a better line.

Excuse me, we're talking here.

No, buddy, we were talking,
you were just...

You were standing looking like a fag.

OK, Charles...
Charles, you run along.

The lady and I are gonna get acquainted.

Where you goin'?
Get your hands off me.

Fine. Relax. You stupid whore.

[Man 1] Take it easy, buddy.

[Man 2] Can we get some ice, please?

Yeah.

Beautiful.

So, what do you think?

You wanna stay, or you wanna go?

I don't know.

I think, um...

I think I wanna fuck you.

You make one sound,
I'll blow your fuckin' heads apart.

Shh!

Always...

...chain your door in a place like this.

But, hey, thanks for the invite.

I'll give you all my money.

[Grunts]
"No sound" means you shut the fuck up.

Please don't hurt him.
You get that?

Give me your fuckin' wallets now.

Come on, give me your wallet.
Come on, come on.


This doesn't look like her...

Hmm.

That stupid fuck
doesn't look like you, neither.

Lucinda.
You two fuckin' around, huh?

Slummin' it, ain't ya?

You're fuckin' slummin' it,
you piece of shit.

Isn't that exciting?

Please, just take the money.

Chuck, I already took your money.

You see this? This was your money,
and I took it. Now it's mine.

I promise we won't go to the police.
I know you won't

'cause you look like a nice guy.
Ain't you a nice guy?

You look nice to me.

She looks kinda nice. Are you nice?
[Whimpering]

Lucinda.

Oh! No!

Let her go, please.
Come on, come on.

Please.
How can I let her go,

such a fine piece of ass like that?

Look at that.

Me and fuckin' Lucinda,
we gotta do a lot of things together.

All kinds of shit.

Oh, man.

I could make you scream, you know?

Is she better than
your wife at home? Ha.

Look at that.


Aah!

What'd you say, Charlie?

I can fuck her? Well, thanks... Charlie.

I knew you were a nice guy.

Whoa! Where you goin', Lucinda?

You gonna take it from him,

I'm so sorry.

I'll call the police.

No. No.

Stop. Stop it.

No.

what we were doing here.

So we tell them.

We have to.

Can't.

said I'm good. No permanent damage.

You get a look at this guy, Chaz?
No.

You call the police?

They're gonna call me
if my wallet turns up.

Maybe you oughta go home.
Did you call Deanna?

Yeah.

There's just, um,
a couple of things I gotta do.

Um... cancel my credit cards.

Call the DMV.
Charles.

Don't be stupid.

Go home. OK?

Goddamn city.

I hate it.


I can'tjust quit my job.
What would I do?

You could teach again.

You used to be a great teacher.

My job is what allows us
to save for Amy's drugs.

How do we do that
on a pair of teachers' salaries?

We could sell the house.

We've already got
two mortgages on the house.

You OK?

I haven't seen you
on the train all week.

I've called in sick the whole week.

I can't eat, I can't sleep.

So he called you.
I think we should go to the police.

No! No, Charles.
You're not understanding me.

If my husband finds out
that I had an affair,

he will file for divorce.
He will do anything.

What do you mean?

He'll take my daughter.

Really?
Yes.

You don't know him. He's not like you.

Now this is all I can spare
without my husband noticing.

No. No way. No. I'll take care of it.

I just wanted to make sure you're OK.

I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

I'm sorry.

Hey.

So you write commercials, huh?

Yeah.

I made this demo for this
coffee commercial this one time.

It was a fine piece of music.

Really?
Yeah.

What'd they say?

They said people
who drink coffee don't like rap.

That's ridiculous.
That's what I said.

So, uh, if I get somethin' to you,

you give it a listen,
uh, see what you can do with it?

Yeah. Sure.
Huh.

Man, you look like shit.

Nice briefcase, though.

Well...

Thanks, Charlie.


That's for canceling your credit cards.

It is a nice briefcase.
It is a nice briefcase.

Keep your head up, homey. [laughs]

<i>I don't often go into the city.</i>

in the knowledge that my</i>

<i>Amerispend One card...</i>

<i>Ameris... Amerispend One...</i>

<i>Shit.</i>

<i>I... I... What's...</i>

Susan Davis calls this
retro avant-garde.

I think it's more retro avant-crap.

Eliot, I'm in trouble.

What kind of trouble?

I cheated on Deanna.

You never cheated before?
No.

Everybody cheats.
You know what? Everybody gets over it.

No, this is different.
Everybody says that too.

Don't worry, you'll be fine.
There's this man...

I don't want to know who it was with.

Look, buy Deanna some flowers.
Talk it over with her.

Try not to get caught next time.

Now, for God's sake,
will you help me fix this piece of crap?

<i>[Woman on TV]
I don't often go into the city.</i>

[Car horn blares]

[Car horn blares]

[Woman 1] You think I should?
[Woman 2] Yeah.

[Winston whistles] Chaz.

What up, yo?
Hey.

Ah, man, welcome back.

How long has it been?

High school.

High school.

Man, the best three years
of my life, man.

All the pussy you could imagine,

4.0 GPA,

everything good
till they locked my ass away.

What were you in for?

Me? I was what they call
a recreational drug user.

And that's it?

I was also
a recreational drug distributor.

You know, a little H, some dope, digi.

So how was it?

Man, nothin' but the best.

I sold a pure commodity
at a fair market price.

No. Prison.

Prison's like walkin' a tightrope.

You try not to get involved.

Actin' like you're blind 24 hours a day.

This shit takes
a shitload of concentration.

I mean, when I first got in thatjoint,
man, I was prime meat.

I was what they call unaffiliated.

So, what'd you do?


I had to stick a shank up in some kid.

What, you killed him?
[Elevator dings]

Your back is up against the wall,

and it's you or him,

you gotta do what you gotta do.

<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

Yeah. This is Charles.

<i>[LaRoche] You ever get
a little sidetracked, Charlie?</i>

<i>I need another loan, Charlie.</i>

Now listen. Listen to me.

I've got no more money for you.

<i>OK. OK, man. You win.</i>

<i>[Scoffs] You want me
to leave you alone,</i>

<i>I'll leave you alone.</i>

<i>No problemo.</i>

<i>For $100,000, though.</i>

Fuck you.

<i>Tsk. You ain't that smart.</i>

<i>Anybody ever told you that?</i>

How'd you get this number?

<i>That's it. Keep thinking like that.</i>

<i>How did I get your cell number?</i>

<i>It isn't listed, is it?</i>

You called my wife.

<i>Ah, no. Guess again.</i>

<i>OK, I'll give you a clue.</i>

<i>On this phone,
it's speed dial number eight.</i>

<i>Hospital one, doctor two.</i>

<i>You're number eight. [laughs]</i>

<i>You don't even rate in the top five.</i>

<i>How does that feel, Charlie?</i>

Oh, Jesus!


[Bernie barking]

Oh, yeah.

Hey! Here's my man.

You OK? You look
like you ran a marathon.

What?

What did you say
to him on the phone?

Well, in our business one has to know
how to light a fire under people.

It's the best way to get things done.
Do you not agree, Charles?

What's going on here?
Mr. LaRoche needs you

to sign off on that thing
he called about.

Oh, gosh.

Did you think I would not come?
No, I thought you got the message.

I'm sorry. I'm confused.

But you look so out of shape, Charles.

Sit down and catch
your breath for a second.

[Deanna] I'll pour coffee.
You don't know how many times

I told him to join my tennis club.
What?

You know Charles. He prefers
to follow sports, not play them.

But one has
to keep fit in today's world

'cause you never know when you'll
need to be at your fighting best.

Please.

He's right. You might have
been able to outrun that mugger.

Oh. Well, from what Charles told me,

that thug had a jump on him
from the very start.

This is crazy.
You never had a chance, did you?

I'm gonna get him back.

You're not getting anyone back.
You have a family.

You're so right, Deanna, so right.

You wanna protect your family
'cause at the end of the day,

this is the most important thing
in the whole world.

Mom, have you seen my sketchbook?
Get back upstairs.

Go do your homework.
Charles.

Amy, this is Mr. LaRoche.
He works with your father.

Come here, beauty. [laughs]

[Speaking French]

It means, "like a little stone
that's rolling down the river."

So cute.

May I kiss you?
Mm-hm.

You know,
we were looking at your drawings.

They're lovely. Truly beautiful.

Thank you.

Such a talent.

You know, when I first came
to this beautiful country,

I spent quite a lot
of time in New York.

And if you allow me, of course,

I could show these
to some very prominent art dealers.

That sounds great.

How about we go sign off
on this contract?

Oh, yes, business is business,
of course.

Bye-bye.
[Amy] Bye.

Whoop!
[Amy laughing]

She's so cute.

I'll be up soon, honey.

How old is she?

You get the fuck out of my house.
What did you say?

Get out.
I beg your pardon.

What'd you say?

[Groaning]
Ooh.

You don't like that, huh?

You upper-crust motherfucker. Huh?

You got it all, and yet you're ready
to fuck it up forjust a bit of pussy?

Fuck...
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
