Sir, nowadays..

..when everyone thinks of becoming
a doctor or engineer..

..why did you choose
to write a novel?

Sir,
where did you write this novel?

Punjab -We have heard that you
have not written it yourself.

lt is written by someone else.
How true is this statement?

Then, who has written this novel?

Sir, l want to ask..

One minute, one minute..

All your questions will be
answered. Your question please?

Sir, from where did you
get the inspiration..

..to write this novel.

My inspiration could be anything..

Professor of sociology,
Deedar Singh

Who had been living alone for
25 years in his house..

..Chardikala Nivas

Or his grandson, Fateh Singh

Who came from America
not just to see him..

..but also to attend the
marriage of Preet..

..the younger sister of his
childhood friend Reet.

Shamsher Singh,
a cunning business man

Who is the son of the late
friend of Deedar Singh.

Deedar Singh helped
Shamsher Singh..

.. to considerably reduce
the expenses..

..by arranging Preet's marriage
at his own place.

Now you must be speculating
which one..

.. of these characters
was my inspiration.

That will become clear during
the next seven days..

..of marriage celebrations.

One minute, one minute..

l forgot to introduce myself
-Being excited in someone else's..

..wedding as if it were your own!

Oh no sir,
l am most awaited by all

l am Dev,
childhood friend of Reet and Fateh

We spent our childhood together..

..laughing and playing in this
very Chardhikala Nivas

That laughter still
rings in my ears.

You are welcome.

Sat Sri Akal, sister.

Congratulations on the wedding.

Sat Sri Akal, Darbara Singh ji.

lt seems the marriage arrangement
are in full swing.

Aunt, l don't see Shamsher
uncle anywhere..

Where is the father
of the bride to be?

He must be here somewhere, busy
with the wedding arrangements.

Aunt, have you come from America?

Hey girl! Do l look like l
have come from America?

No Gujri, Aunt is from Patiala
and not from America.

Hey young girl!
Whom did you address as aunt?

Come, please be seated.

Bravo!

l presumed that some guy from
Phagwara is fixing the lights..

..but you turned out to be my
bosom friend from Philadelphia.

O my friend!

lt seems unbelievable that you
are my own friend Fateh.

Wow, my brave friend! How are you?

Ten years have gone by,
it is a long period

lt seemed that you are desi
only in appearance..

..but you are a perfect
Punjabi speaking desi.

Dear friend,
l am tired of speaking English.

Now when in Punjab, we will talk
in Punjabi, isn't it Gujri?

O yes Uncle,
we will talk in Punjabi

Dev, she is my niece, Gujri.
She is here to meet all of you.

Sat Sri Akal. -Sat Sri Akal ji.

How is our 'Green chilli'?

Dev!

Mr. Hardev, you have come here
to attend my marriage.

Only Dev.

Hardev, Hardev Malhotra.

Hardev!

O Mom, you too have joined them!

O, will you just hang
out with the kids?

Go and meet Fateh's grandfather..

Aunt, you will be able
to meet Grandfather..

..only when he is at home.
-After having invited..

.. where has Sardar ji
himself disappeared?

Here comes Grand Pa.

Pita ji is here.
Let us go and meet him.

Pita ji, Pita ji!

Sat Sri Akal

Look here,

My gift? -Thank you.

Pita ji, our gift?

Mine too. -Sure.

Which one was that?

What is this?

Pita ji, a book?

Daughter, continue your studies
after your marriage.

Having invited guests
at your place..

..where had you disappeared,
Singh Sahib?

You are not our guests.
This is your own home.

Hardev, my son, how are you?

l am good.

Hardev, Hardev Malhotra

See, this is not good that
now you join us..

.. only in happiness and grief.

Now l am talking like an old man.

The truth is, that l am old man.

No, Grand Pa.

But l can befriend young children.

Fateh, my son, your turban
is looking grand.

All arrangements finalized, son?

Grand Pa,
all set, lights are fixed..

..caterer intimated
instructions for..

..the car to be decked are given.
-What about the tent?

Oh yes, Grand Pa, it is all done

Dear son Dev..

..thanks a lot for having spared
some time to be with us.

You have visited us after
a very long time.

lt is good.

Darbara singh ji,
what are you doing?

Darbara and myself are
together cleaning..

..the layers of dust
from these pictures.

They have become hazy with time.

Only if there is some
one to look at them..

..we will clean them up.

lsn't it Darbara?

Well son,
how is your business doing?

Every thing is going fine.

l have purchased a pharmaceutical
company. Let us see.

l have learnt that land is
cheaper in you area..

..may be l do some business here.

Forget about work.
lt is never ending.

Since now you are
with the family..

..it is time to mix up,
eat, drink and enjoy.

After all, family is the ultimate
solace for a man..

..isn't it brother Darbara?

Enough Mr. Singh, enough of it,
as V.C of this university..

..l have some responsibilities.

l have been getting lots of
complaints against you.

You are professor in sociology.
Hmm?

l mean, you have not been
given extension..

..after your retirement to play
around with the rules..

.. and regulations
of the university.

l mean, is there already less
politics in the university..

..so that you have started
leadership classes?

Correct, these classes are closely
linked to my subject.

See, l am going to be retiring
in some time.

l want to do something
before that.

Give it up Mr. Singh, give it up.

Not a single student is willing
to attend your classes.

Does it make any sense? Hmm?

But you had promised that you
will sendme some students.

Please help.

You won't give it up, isn't it?

l know you well sir.
l have been your student.

Okay Sir, let us do one thing.

A few students are a burden
on our university.

There are a few who are rolling..

.. from one department
to the other..

..after having failed
for 2-3 years.

Others are wasting themselves
in the hostel..

.. after having been suspended.
-l will send them to you.

No, no. What do you mean?

You want me to make future leaders
out of these illiterate..

..irresponsible people?

Sir,
what else are leaders made up of?

What? That is..

l am just joking, Sir.

Moreover, Sir, qualification
is not displayed..

.. on their forehead.

They are very famous students
of the university.

Others will follow suit.

Thank you. -Sir.

Please hurry up, Aunt.
-Let us go, if it gets dark..

.. we will not be able
to finish any work.

O Son, what are you talking?

We are here to attend
the marriage.

lf we don't get decked up. -What
will be our impression on others?

O, where are you taking the
whole gang? -Shopping!

Shopping? That is for girls.

Why are you dragging boys into it?

Now you are entrapped and
can't escape, child.

You are bound to spend a
few hours with them.

Few hours? -Yes.

Here comes Dad.

See, Uncle too has arrived.

l will just go and meet him,
wait for a minute.

Sat Sri Akal Uncle, Sat Sri Akal.

How are you, my son? -Great,
all is well. -Sat Sri Akal.

What is the matter Son..

..you are the last one to come
and the first one to leave?

You were the most eagerly
awaited person here.

How is your business?

We will talk about business later.

Right now we are going
for shopping.

Okay, all the best.

Sat Sri Akal, sister.
-Sat Sri Akal ji. -Enjoy yourself

Thank you, Uncle. -Okay, Papa.

Let us go.

Hurray! Hurray!

We have reached the
Mall in Ludhiana.

How to get down?
-Preet, hold my hand.

Gol gappas! Let us have something
to eat and drink first.

We have just arrived from home..

..and at the sight of gol gappas
mouth has started watering!

What are you looking at?
Fateh singh ji..

.. Bhojpuri films in Punjab?

Why are you serving him first,
it is my turn.

l was the first to arrive.
-Get aside!

Oye, you hard core scoundrel!

Well done, very good, go on
fighting, go on fighting

Baba Punjaba!

Fight, bravo fight! Go ahead,
fight amongst yourselves.

lt has many advantages.

lt leaves behind tattered,
shattered, defaced..

.. and ugly faces..

..and a lame Punjab.
Yes, a lame Punjab..

While you fight amongst
yourselves..

..some body else will plunder
Punjab.. yes..

..some one else will loot Punjab..

.. 'Dama dam mast kalandar'.

Just like the mediator monkey
between the two fighting cats..

..'dama dam mast kalander'

Go on fighting,
go on fighting among yourselves.

Brother Fateh, do you get all
these things in America?

These chhole (grams).. tikkies..

..shakarkandis (sweet
potatoes) and..

..sangharas (water chestnuts)?

Friend, we do get every thing
there, you know but..

But you don't enjoy the way
you do here, right? -Ya!

These carts,
wheelbarrows and white girls..

..you must be coming
across girls there?

But she is all the more beautiful,
friend.

Oh my God! Wait for a second,
l will be right back.

Fateh! -l will be right back.

Hmm.

l was only..

Mr. Malhotra, go on, go on..

They have left.

They have also left.

Okay l will also leave.

Wait!

You are very lucky friend..

..you can meet white
girls even in lndia.

Come on!
She is my very good friend.

She has been in lndia for the last
one year, doing research.

l have invited her.

She will stay with us for a while.

She has been here in
lndia for one year..

..and l get to see her only now
how is it possible, friend?

Hurray! All brothers and sisters
will remember forever when..

..they eat the jalebis (Punjabi
sweet) made by Deedar Singh.

Very delicious!

O Auntie ji!
Sister! You too have jalebies.

Whom did you address as Aunt?

l don't eat fried things.

l want to maintain myself,
slim and trim, as such.

You can have,
these are boiled ones!

These are boiled in oil!
lsn't it sir?

Now you have taken control
of our kitchen too.

Oh no daughter,
l thought l should help..

..so that you get some
relief from work.

Eat jalebies!

Have you heard the jalebi related
stories of Pita ji?

Didi, do tell us the jalebi
related stories of Pita ji.

What a topic to start!

What did Pita ji offer his would
be wife when he met her..

..for the first time?

Jalebies!
Along with rabri (condensed milk)

At Lahore.

What did you offer her..

..when she came to your
place after marriage?

Jalebies.

(Oh, yes) mixed with milk cream.

What did he distribute
at the birth of Fateh?

Ladoo. (Punjabi sweet)

No, jalebies.

And now on Preet's marriage?

Jale.. bi..

Pita ji, please don't mind,
tell me one thing..

..you got married a
long time back..

..did you meet your would
be wife secretly..

..as Preet didi and
Sartaj Jiju do?

See, God has predestined couples.

lt depends upon their
choice whether..

..they meet secretly or openly.

God will definitely unite them..

..if they are ready to be united.

l have been ready for
a long time now..

..but God doesn't send a
beautiful maiden for me.

Sat Sri Akal.

Carrie, how are you doing?

Good,.
-Well, you finally made it. Haa.

Dada ji she is Carrie.
-Sat Sri Akal.

Meet my Dada Ji,
Preet, Reet and Uncle.

She is Carrie. -She has been here
in lndia for the last one year..

..doing research on Punjab.

That's nice.

She is writing a book as well.

l have invited her to attend
Preet's marriage.

She will stay with us till the
wedding. -Most welcome.

Why only till the wedding?

She can stay as long
as she desires..

..or till all the bachelors
are married.

Great! Well-done Preet kaur.

When will we get to eat
ladoos (panjabi..

..sweet) on Reet's marriage?
-You are welcome to eat ladoos..

..why do you need to use
marriage as an excuse?

l am talking only of ladoo,
that too with green chilli.

Dev, couldn't you get any
girl to get married?

He has come across many girls..

..but not one that he
could get married to.

Oh yes, not for marriage.
Not at all.

Why so my friend what
type of girl..

..do you require for marriage?
-One who is tall,

Beautiful and charming.

Should know how to cook as well.

She should be working but
homely at the same time.

Oh God!
Please save me from these girls.

Have you opened up a marriage
beareu? -Moreover..

..it seems that the marriage
bureau is doing very well.

You have a lot of information.

What is the name of the company?

'Green Chilli' or 'Red
Chilli' Enterprise?

Dev, Dev!!

See, she has got a call from
one of her clients.

Let it go,
Fateh, you are here in lndia..

..haven't you selected
a girl for yourself?

The girls here are very beautiful
and good as well.

Moreover,
we have now Marriage agency too.

You should seek help
from the agency.

Meanwhile..

..l have an important work to
do and will join you later.

Fateh Singh ji, are you enjoying
the warmth of Punjab?

Funny man, it is amazing the
way he makes you laugh.

Yes, he makes you laugh..

..but how agonized his heart is.

First, it was his son,
now his grand son..

..he does not have
anyone with him.

And Darshan..

Dev, Fateh, Reet.

Darshan.

So, tell me what is going
on these days?

You have not replied to my
emails in a long time.

Sorry for that. -All of us have
been very busy because of Preet.

lt had become very difficult
to get her married..

..as she did not like anyone.

But she is better than you..

At least she agreed
to get married.

Tell me one thing,
if you don't mind..

..why haven't you gotten
married yet?

l had been waiting for you!!

See l have befooled you!!

Hi! Beautiful! As soft as a bowl
of cream! Can l help you?

Moreover,
what is here to do research on?

Let us go out for a stroll.

Have you an idea about those
that twinkle at night?

Give me a break, 'Stars'.

Oh no.. glow worms.. very cute,
friend, very cute.

You will get many more ideas too.

Sure.

Too much load for a delicate girl.

Son, have milk.

Mom, please.

Quiet! Finish the whole in one go.

He is a grown up guy..

..who can make him understand
in the presence of guests?

Leave her and take milk.

Diamond is for hundred
thousand and..

..hundred twenty five thousand..

Please have it.

God Himself protects the honour
of the parents of a bride.

Have rasgullas (lndian Sweet)

Reet!

Coming.

How pretty this girl is!

Sister, to tell you the truth,
l did not like it.

Shamsher Singh should
have gotten his..

..elder daughter married first..

..as the social system demands.

How does it matter to us?

Lock has been put on the latch..

So could you talk to Reet?

No

She hurt me even before
l could express myself.

Sorry.

Hey Heer! Oh Heer! Listen!

What is this? -Love lorn Ranjha
became an ascetic..

..for the sake of your love.
-This is adorable.

You are looking very pretty.
-Thank You.

What is going on?

Friend! l am just trying
to befriend your friend.

Why? lf befriending my
friend is going..

..to strengthen our friendship?

Why are you trying to confuse me?

lt is okay Fateh, he is harmless.

Sure, he is harmless.

We will know the reality only when
he will hurt your feelings.

Why not? As for hurting feelings,
Reet Kaur is an expert.

You are very touchy Fateh.

Touchy? -Somebody is come to
see you after so many years.

You should be careful
while teasing him.

Give me a break, Fateh.

What did you assume, that you will
come back after ten years..

..will have a chit chat with
the girl on the internet..

..and if you happen to like the
girl you will marry her?

You are confronted with a
Sardarni from Ludhiana!

Be careful,
it is not that simple, Fateh.

Precisely, it is not that simple.

You are looking very pretty.

Should l wear this one?
Will it match? -Yes, it will.

Magenta color looks grand on you.

Reet, Preet is now going to
her own home (in-law's).

You should also think about
getting married too.

Enough of your TV journalism!

l have told you so
many times that..

..l don't want to get married.

Then what should l tell people.
Hmm?

There is something called
public image.

My father is more concerned
about public image rather..

..than with my happiness.
-Exactly..

..he has always been very
conscious about public opinion.

Mother,
l don't want to get married.

Don't worry, daughter..

..no one will compel you till
you are mentally ready.

lt is not about being
mentally prepared.

When l am happy as such..

..then why should l spoil
another person's life..

..by bonding myself with him?

lt is not good to talk like this.

Don't talk like this my child.

Companionship is also very
important in life.

And if you get someone to
share your happiness..

..the happiness of life gets
multiplied manifold.

Why don't l see that happiness
in the eyes of my mother?

Sorry. -Sorry..

..in your country, apology is
expressed in terms of 'Sorry'?

l should not have teased
you like that.

Right.

You should not have
done it at all.

And never mock anyone like that.

lt is not necessary that l should
feel the same way you do.

You don't like me.

But l have the right to cherish
your desire in my heart.

Hey! Stop!

Dev! Fateh!

Dev, some creepy guy tried
to grab me on the stairs.

Oh, ho, marriage activity
is on in the house..

..someone might be looking
for his belongings.

Let us sing a song.

Look at the ways of the
all-powerful God..

..born to their parents..

.. daughters are taken
away by others.

Look at the ways of the
all-powerful God..

..born to their parents..

.. daughters are taken
away by others.

Sister..

..just look at Shamsher Singh,
there are tears in his eyes.

lt is not easy to get
separated from..

..the one who is very
dear to heart.

Let me tell you one thing,

Shamsher Singh will not
cry as much when..

..Preet leaves after her wedding..

..as he cried when she was born.

Papa!

Yes, my child!

Papa, why did you cry?

Child,
just while listening to that song.

No father,
why did you cry when l was born?

You could bear the burden
of even seven sons.

You could bear the burden
of even seven sons.

Not even one daughter could
be accepted. Alas!

Not even one daughter could
be accepted. Alas!

The one who cried a
lot while departing

The one who cried a
lot while departing

And even mother could not
console her.. alas!

And even mother could not
console her.. alas!

The bride is very beautiful,
charming and winsome.

We adore you dear daughter..

..and will protect you
with our life.

Oh bride! Bedecked with chaplet
around his head..

..the bridegroom has
come to marry you.

His forehead bedecked with
chaplet, he has come to wed you.

He brings eternal happiness,
o bride!

The bridegroom is
here to wed you.

The bridegroom is
here to wed you.

You are great,
Othe brave daughter of Punjab!

You are great,
O the brave daughter of Punjab!

Fond of working on the
spinning wheel..

..you spin pieces of cotton
on the spindle.

The elbows and the wrists
work continuously..

..in the spinning process.

A rhythmic sound gets
created when..

..the churning stick rotates..

With the same rhythm you run fast
while climbing the stairs.

You have mirror like purity
and truthfulness..

You are great!
O, brave daughter of Punjab!

Only l have managed to spend
my life with you..

..no one else will do that.

Only l have managed
to stay with you..

..none else would do that.

Only l have shared
laughter with you..

..none else will do that.

Listen to me right now,
at this very moment..

..and find out a solution,
otherwise go away.

Only l have shared
laughter with you..

..none else will do that.

A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

A light-hearted conversation
has led to love.

ln the jovial atmosphere,
l too happened to laugh..

And then the laughter disappeared
from those lips.

Necklace of tears then
adorned the neck.

A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

O young man with the red turban!
Listen to what l say..

Provide shade of umbrella,
so that l can sit underneath.

A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

Only l have shared
laughter with you..

..none else will do that.

A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

Only l have shared
laughter with you..

..none else will do that.

A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

Only l have shared
laughter with you..

..none else will do that.

Can you put this on. -Yes.

Sat Sri Akal, Shamsher Singh ji.

Come in, Maan sahib.

Maan sahib, l want to introduce
you to a very hardworking..

..and futuristic young boy.

Dev, Son, come here.

l will just come back.

That's fine.

Maan sahib, he is Dev, the
owner of H & M Company.

Please be seated.

Pleased to meet you.

You have brought laurels
to the community..

..by doing a great job
at such a young age.

Dev,
Son, he is Sukhjinder Maan Sahib..

..a very dear friend of mine.

This time he is also contesting
elections.

lnterested in politics?

There is no time for that.

Let it not be politics,
we can talk about business.

Dev, Maan sahib is going to
start a very big project.

There is no dearth of
money and planning.

He needs a boy like you to
look after the business.

l have learnt that you
intend to purchase..

..more land to expand
your business.

Yes, that is right.

And one more pharmaceutical
company? -Yes.

Son,
he has got a plan to open the..

..biggest pharmaceutical company..

..which is the foremost
need of our people.

Excuse me, l did not get it.

Let it be.

We are talking about the real one.

l think you are mistaken.

l am not into this
kind of business.

Son Dev, where are you going,
just listen to me.

Hey, you can show me the styles!

Like this?

Darbara,
give double coca-cola to Gujri.

Go dear. -Come Dad.

Shamsher, you did not introduce
me to your friends.

ls it possible that l won't
introduce you to my friends?

He is very good friend of mine,
Sukhjinder Maan.

You are welcome.

Sat Sri Akal.

Sukhjinder Singh Shinda..

..M.A Political Science,
94 batch, rusticated twice.

What is he doing here?

To attend the wedding..

No, no.

The marriage has been performed,
O my father!

The marriage has been performed,
O my father!

The marriage has been performed,
O my father!

As Gurmukh l have found the Lord

The darkness of ignorance
has been dispelled.

The Guru has revealed
the blazing..

..light of spiritual wisdom.

My marriage has been performed,
O my father!

May God bless you, my daughter!

This is how it is here,
don't worry.

But she is crying.

You will also cry one day..

..when a handsome guy like me
will marry and take you away.

Dev, people cry..

..when they leave their near
and dear ones' behind..

..l have none.

Certainly, now there is
somebody in your life.

lf you abandon him
he will cry a lot.

You will look very funny crying.

Go, daughter.

No child, don't cry.
What else do you want..

..your sister is married in a good
family, don't cry, come..

..he will keep her happy,
come my daughter.

lf you don't realize,
you will be wiped out..

..O the natives of Hindustan!

One owl is good enough
to bring destruction..

..to the beautiful garden..

And when each one of the branches
has an owl perched on it.

l wonder what will be the
fate of that garden!

This is very good.

Okay, which is your favourite
latest TV serial ?

Bolo tara.. ra.. ra

Which is the latest Hindi
film being screened?

Sir, we live in Punjab,
it will be good..

..if you talk about a Punjabi
film. -Sir, Munde UK De

Who is the captain of the
Cricket team of lndia?

Leave it Sir,
what sort of question is this?

Dhoni ji Dhoni.

How many rivers are there
in our Punjab?

Sir,
what type of question is this?

Sir, 'Five waters' naturally
means, there are five rivers.

Ravi, Beas and Satluj are there..

..and the rest two
are those that..

..flow at the back of your house?

How many educated persons
are there in our Punjab?

Sir, you are unnecessary indulging
in calculations.

We are all educated.

Okay, what qualities should
a good leader possess?

What qualities? Eat,
drink and be merry, that's it.

lsn't it friends?

This year is sweet,
who has seen the next?

Name a good leader.

Here he is, our Ranjeeta.

Ranjeet Singh,
village Gurdaspur, age 28 years..

..has been here in the
same university..

..for the last seven years..

..quite a progress!

There once was one Maharaja Ranjit
Singh of Punjab and..

..here today is one our
dear Ranjit Singh ji..

..local youth leader,
representative of all students.

A leader should set an example.

Those who are not themselves
disciplined, don't keep time..

..how can they teach discipline
to others?

What example will they set
for others to follow?

What is happening to
our Punjabi youth?

They watch 'Singh is King' and
assume themselves to be kings.

lndia wins the cricket match..

..they set off fireworks and
assume themselves to be Dhoni

You need to have substance,
substance within..

.. to be a leader.

Ranjit Singh ji,
this hollow leadership..

..and this hollow show
off is of no use.

'Hollow leadership'!

l will teach you a lesson
about leadership.

Sir, are you okay? -Sir, how dare
they, l will see to them.

No, no, l am fine.
lt is all right.

Farid, do not turn around and..

..strike those who strike
you with their fist..

Kiss their feet and return
to your own home.

Preet, can you please hand over
the jewellery box to me.

What happened?

Nothing.

Missing her?

Missing? Me or you?

Mind is a very peculiar thing..

Sometimes it soars high in the
sky and at times falls flat..

At times it says 'No' and at
other times says 'Yes'..

One should always listen
to its voice.

lf your mind tries to tell you
something, do listen to it.

There is no harm.

And there should be no hesitation
in changing your opinion.

There is no peace..

..no sleep..

There is no peace, no sleep..

There is no peace, no sleep..

For one who treads
the path of love

One who falls in love,
cries and appeals

One who falls in love,
cries and appeals

lt becomes matter of life and..

..death and he understands
nothing

One who falls in love,
cries and appeals.

One who falls in love,
cries and appeals.

Preet Didi is already married,
now it is Reet Didi's turn.

No, no, Uncle (Fateh) will
get married first.

To Simran.

They are good friends.

Both of them are from
America and..

..the marriage proposal
is being talked about.

Okay.

The path of love is
full of sorrows

One must tread it cautiously.

Even at the peak of noon,
there appears pitch darkness

One must tread it cautiously.

Simran Didi, these are my toys..

..l will take them from
you when l come there.

Okay. l will deliver the
toys at your place.

Gujri, this one is from me.

Oh yes, now you will stay
at Fateh's place.

What do you mean?

l mean,
both of you are getting married.

Getting married?
Are you crazy? What do you mean?

l am sorry, Simran.

Come here!
Are you out of your mind?

Yes, l am, Fateh.
l had a high opinion of you..

..but what kind of person you
have turned out to be?

As soon as l turned you down,
you found a new girl, right?

lt is true though, there is no
dearth of girls for you..

..if not this one,
another will do.

Why are you feeling so bad?

You did not have any
feelings for me.

And then for how long, how long
could l have waited for you?

lt is my life.
l want to move on in my life.

Look at your face.

Fateh!

You know,
some people never change.

They keep on waiting
for the time..'

'..when 'No' will
change into 'Yes'

Did you enjoy the story?

Now, you tell me..
the king first..

Pita ji, answer my query first.

Please ask.

Pita ji,
tell me where is Philadelphia?

Oh son, around us, there..

..is no village by this name.

Pita ji, it is not a village where
we have cows and buffaloes.

lt is a beautiful city from where
Fateh Singh ji has come.

There it is.

Oh Nihal Singh ji,
Oh Nihal Singh ji..

..you drink the milk of Punjab's
cows and buffaloes..

..and sing praises of America?

Sir, what am l hearing?

l am fine.

lt is okay, Sir.
But Sir, you know..

..that if this incident
comes in the news..

..it will not be good for the
image of the University.

Balbir Singh, while l am not
bothered even about my life..

..you are concerned about the
image of the university?

Please help me..

..you just grant me a period of
two or three more months..

Sir, You know that who
has attacked you?

You will have to be very
cautious of this boy..

.. lf you hurt his ego he won't..

..let you be there for long, Sir.

Sat Sri Akal ji.

The battle drum beats in
the sky of the mind,

Aim is taken and the
wound is inflicted.

Aim is taken and the
wound is inflicted.

The spiritual warrior enters
the field of battle,

Now is the time to fight!
-Oh friend..

..what is this, you woke me
up so early in the morning.

Dev, it is Gurpurub time..

..l want to see all celebrations.

That is why l am here.
You know that?

Don't you have any interest?

l have interest.

Look here,
what have l brought for you.

Cover your head, if go you must.

He alone is known as
the spiritual hero..

..who fights in defence of faith.

He may be cut, piece-by-piece.

He may be cut, piece-by-piece.

He may be cut..

..piece-by-piece, but he never
quits the field of battle.

Waheguru..
Waheguru.. Waheguru.. Waheguru..

Waheguru..
Waheguru.. Waheguru.. Waheguru..

First, accept death and give
up any hope of life.

Become the dust of
the feet of all.

Become the dust of
the feet of all.

Then you may come to Me.

What do you want from me?

Stop! Stop! Stop it.

What do you want from me?

Stop. lt is my bag.

Don't worry so much, child.

l have never been so terrified
in my entire life.

l don't know what did
he want from me.

Why he was chasing me.

Anyways, l got some good shots.

These pictures are so pretty.

l lost my favourite bag.

Had l lost my camera, all my
memories would have got lost.

Camera is not dearer
than you girl!

l had given up all hope of
happiness in my family.

Life had been moving mechanically.

But you are here now,
take care of yourself.

You are the first girl with whom
l have seen my son happy.

l can't see him sad.

Hello! -Yes Sir. Sat Sri Akal.

How far have you talked
about it yet?

Could you manage to
talk to Dev or not?

Gurjeet,
Gurjeet, just for a minute.

Speak out Killia.

Sir, it was your idea.
You have to accomplish it.

Moreover,
Sir, transactions of land..

.. and the process
of commissioning..

..of factories is time consuming.

See, l am already working on it.

ln fact, l want to kill two
birds with one stone.

You should be ready.

As for Dev, l will make him
pester Deedar Singh.

l am the right hand of Maan sahib.

Sir,
now elections are approaching.

Money is needed for campaigning.

We have to find out ways
and means to arrange it.

Be careful and observant..

..lest the enemy should be there
within your household.

Come here children,
first take Parshaad..

..and then keep on playing.
-Parshaad!

Uncle, this morning you
have offered Parshad..

..what is the happy occasion?

Today is my grandson,
Darshan's birthday.

Listen,
Listen, all and one listen..

..commoners as well as the
selected ones listen..

..old as well as the young listen,

Oh voters as well as
the leaders listen..

.. all those holding the pen
and the sympathizers listen.

Oh Almighty! You too listen:

The sixth river of drugs is rising
high up to the waist..

.. higher still it is going
above the shoulders.

lt is about to bring destruction
to countless homes.

Please find out some solution..

..some remedy to save
the situation.

What is he doing?

Well done, well done!

Why do you want to get
hit by my vehicle?

The death which scares people,
gives me pleasure.

Well done! Well done!

Fateh,l will be back after
inquiring about Darshan.

Fine.

Darshan,
somebody is here to see you.

Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

You act and incite others
to act and then deny it.

You act and incite others
to act and then deny it.

The Lord is always with you.
He sees and hears everything.

Bravo! Be more forceful.

Let the swing go still higher!
Go on, Darshan!

Go on Darshan, still higher!

Further! Still Further!

Darshan.

What kind of treatment is this?

What type of treatment
do you provide?

lf you have any alternative
treatment..

..then take him back home and
get the treatment done.

Darshan, let us go home.

Home?

You are in love with
your enemies..

..while you renounce true friends.

Did you get chance to see Darshan?

Shall we go now or you have to
spend the whole day here?

Let us go!

Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

Just a minute,
l have an important call.

Waheguru! Waheguru!

Waheguru! Waheguru!

Waheguru!

Dev!

Yes.

lt does not make any
difference to you?

What do you mean?

Our childhood friend got
shattered like this..

He is in such a bad condition..

lt never occurred to you
that you could help him?

Wish you had given
him timely help..

..so many years have
passed by and..

..you never went to see him once?

Even your father did
not come to see..

..your Grandpa for
all these years.

Very good Fateh Singh,
sounds good to give sermons..

.. after returning from a foreign
country once in a blue moon!

Stay here Fateh Singh and
see for yourself..

..you will come across so..

Many Darshans every day
that even agony..

..and pain will get benumbed.

Sat Sri Akal, Dadaji

Sat Sri Akal ji, may you live
long! -What are you doing here?

We had come to see your class.
-There was nothing to be seen.

How is the class going on?

ln fact, it is a difficult task

l mean..

..the modern boys and girls come
to the university to enjoy..

.. and have fun and not to attend
such a serious class.

How will they understand the
purpose of your class?

l don't think so.

l agree, it is difficult,
not impossible though.

Grandpa, tell me one thing,
why is this frame empty?

Son, you tell me whose picture
should be put up here?

ls there any one to match
their greatness?

Any role model, any leader..

..who can inspire us
to emulate him?

There have been many leaders..

..but no one had compassion
for this land.

Whoever came was selfish.

Lest this frame should
remain empty..

..that is the whole purpose
of this endeavor.

Are you busy?

Not for you.

What are you trying to find?

Something meaningful about the
place you live and breath in..

Punjab. -All l hear and see
is Punjabi music and dance.

What is the problem with dancing?

O The Sixth River,
'Chhevan Dariya' ..

Land of five rivers -Punjab..

and then which is the Sixth River?

Oh! You will find out soon enough.

Why do you keep me guessing?

Life itself is a riddle
just like you!

May be l am a riddle.. solve it.

Oh, wait.

Punjab,
the land of five rivers became

The forerunner of the
Green Revolution.

Green fields of this
land never let the..

..basket of lndia go without food.

But today, the Punjab scenario
is very painful.

Our farmers committing suicide,
our youth sunk in addiction..

.. our new generation being
the target of AlDS ..

All this has posed a big question
mark in front of us..

why all this?
-This is what l call meaningful.

lt is a huge help.

l can help you too.

Really?

Let us go out in the open,
under the sky..

..where you will get
many more new ideas.

So,
finally l got a response from you.

There is a lot of response.

Okay, tell me what happened to
the Green Revolution in..

..the state of Punjab?

A lot has changed,
you did not notice it.

Who is responsible for
the farmer's suicide?

Tell me, is it the Water level,
some defective policies..

..the farmers themselves somehow
or the drug abuse?

There is a lot of intoxication.

Come,
let me answer all your queries.

My love exists only for you
and follows your path.

Don't desert me ..

l have given up the whole world
having reposed trust.

And hope in you ..

All my warmth of love for you.

The inroads to my heart
are only for you.

So you tell me l am the only
one you want to be with now.

So, what about it?

And you feel that my love you
just cannot live without.

Yeah, think about it.

And you tell me that my heart
is a lovers work of art.

You love my lovely lips and
l love your finger tips.

What is all this craziness?

We are on this earth
just once like this

Don't you know we have
just one life to live!

l dream of you alone.

After having seen you..

..my gaze became oblivious
of the world.

l dream of you alone.

After having seen you..

..my gaze became oblivious
of the world.

l saw you as my destination.

l follow in your footsteps.

You are my faith, my hope.

All warmth of love for you.

The inroads to my heart
are only for you.

Keep carefully the
silver anklets..

..and yellow scarf my
fair sister-in law.

Keep carefully the
silver anklets..

..and yellow scarf,
my fair sister-in law.

The anklets of the young
maidens inflamed..

..the passion of young boys.

The anklets of the young maiden
kept on beckoning ..

So much fun!

Ya!

Woo! Woo!

Hello!

What is the news?

No good news, Sir.
-Why, What happened?

Max, a foreign company's proposal
has been approved.

Sir, are you listening?

They are going to establish
the firm here itself.

But don't worry, Sir.
How can an outsider excel us?

Moreover, you have already planned
to start a new business.

There is no harm in it.

What happened?

A lot has happened and its
solution has to be found.

You have wasted your
life in slumber.

Your spinning wheel is
without a strand.

What will you do while your
dowry is not ready.

Wake up, don't keep on snoring!

This laid back attitude
does not behoove you.

Concentrate, Himmat.

Where are you focused?

At me,
at the ball or somewhere else?

A leader can reach his
destination only..

..if he is focused on the track.

Do you understand?

Sir, what destination are
you proposing for us?

This is a very good question.

Come along.
-You must be thinking that while..

..l had been teaching sociology..

.. for the last 30 years,
now what is the purpose..

..of these leadership classes.

My colleagues say..

..Brother Deedar Singh,
all those who are idle..

.. and worthless will
automatically become leaders.

But when the things
go beyond control..

..and there seems no guardian
of this land.

When the torch bearers themselves
barter the land..

..for their own benefit,
then you should know..

.. that this is the
opportune time to..

..make leaders from
this very land.

Every year elections are
held in this university.

Many students win these elections.

How many of them contest
the state elections?

Sir, they get deflated here only.

My purpose is clear.

l want you to come forward..

..and become enlightened,
intelligent, educated..

.. qualified and unblemished
leaders.

By pointing at corruption
repeatedly..

..you can't do away with it.

You have to be in the system
to beat the system.

Mere words will not
achieve anything.

l have seen people changing.

lf you have courage,
zeal and clear vision..

..then you will definitely
achieve your goal.

But you have to be clear
about your goal.

This is how battle in
the field is won.

Right Ranjit?

Where did you get stuck up, Fateh?

l don't know that whether you
are an old man of 25 years..

..or l am a young man of 60.

Come on! Join me.

What happened to the nourishing
food you had in America?

Grandpa, finally, some students
did come for the class.

lt takes some time.

Moreover, you have taken up
a very challenging task.

Fateh,
every body does the easy task.

But Grandpa, you always preferred
the tedious paths.

After 84, all of us went abroad..

..you were alone for 25 years.

Loneliness never perturbs me.

But even Dad never came
back to see you.

Yes,
he never came back even once to..

..meet me during the
last 25 years.

lt did not hurt me.

Every individual has his
own compulsions..

..has one's own troubles.

But you have come to see me, son.

Even that has a motive, Grandpa.

He wants that the deal for your
land should get finalized..

Because..

Because after my death
there will..

..be no one to look after my land?

One doesn't get such
a paradise anywhere.

One cannot get it.

Ripe wheat crop and
sweet smell of..

..the fully blooming paddy crop!

How will l breathe without that?

The surging sea of mustard
flowers gives..

.. that a father gets on seeing
the progress of his son.

What happened, Grandpa?

The government wants to
acquire our land..

..that stretches across for miles.

What should l tell
them that my own..

..blood too intends
to do the same?

Dev, what are you looking
at early in the morning?

Nothing Uncle, had just been
looking at Pitaji's fields.

Oh, l envision grapevines
stretched across this land..

..and a factory in the middle.

Factory?

Yes, not local, we will
make English liquor.

Local company and English liquor!

lt is an excellent opportunity.

This village will be just
the starting point.

Gradually, in every city H &
M Distillery will be famous.

Distillery , why Distillery.

Dev,
nowadays every nook and corner..

..of Punjab has a liquor shop.

lt has become a very flourishing
business, boy.

Otherwise also, Maan Sahib
is contesting elections.

When Elections are contested
and won..

..then liquor shops naturally
come up. lsn't it?

And when distilleries are started,
many people get employment.

Think about it!

lt is a bit difficult
task for Maan Sahib..

..but for you, it is very easy.

Dev, you know it very well,
that in this village..

..and in the surrounding
villages..

..Deedar Singh owns
the maximum land.

lf we talk to him about the land,
things will be easier.

Otherwise also,
he treats you as his own son.

He loves you a lot.

He won't refuse you.
You should talk to him. Hmm?

How? How dare you?

How dare you talk like that?

lf l had to sell my land, l would
have sold it 25 years back..

..and joined my son in America.

And now, Fateh and myself
would have come here..

..to attend Preet's wedding.

This land is still worth
a gold mine..

.. only if the young
and hard working..

..sons of the farmer toil it.

But the real tragedy is
that the young sons..

..have severed themselves
from this land.

Hardev, you can utilize this
land as per your desire.

But in future, no one will talk
about the sale of my land.

l won't sell my land.
l cannot sell it.

Fateh and yourself
together can do..

..whatever you wish to
do in these fields.

l am not that fortunate.

Oh no Friend, you just tell
me what do you want to do.

l am on your side.

How are you with me, Fateh?

You live in America.

Moreover..

..by staying here for two or four
months one can't do business.

Hardev,
there are things beyond business.

This business and money and
everything else will be left here.

And so will these fields..

Why do you wander in
delusion like this..

Why do you wander in
delusion like this..

Why do you wander in
delusion like this..

Fateh!

Fateh! You felt bad?

l am sorry, Fateh.

You felt bad today..

..because whatever happened
was in your presence.

But what about the things
that happened..

..to Grandpa in your absence?

Dev's words hurt you so much.

What about the agonies
Grandpa must..

..have experienced
all these years..

..whose echoes never
reached your ears?

How can a person be
so stonehearted..

..that he did not come
back even once..

..to see his father in 25 years?

What was uncle's compulsion,
Fateh?

Fateh! Sometimes age old
wounds get healed just..

.. by a touch and at times..

Dad!

Hi Fateh! How are you?

l am good.

Dad,
l am not coming back next week.

Yes, l know next week..

What did you say,
you are not coming back next week?

Yes.

Then, when are you coming back?

After six months.

We had sent you to lndia
to sell our land..

..does it take so much time?

Dad, l am not selling any land.

Did the old man..

Grandpa did not say
anything to me.

l don't want to listen to
anything in this regard.

l want to see you here next week.

Sorry, Dad! -By the way, what
do you want to accomplish..

..by staying there for six months?

May be l can sow a seed..
someday something will grow.

ln fact Dev, Deedar Singh should
not have talked like that.

But, maybe he had some compulsion.

With years of hard work,
l set up a great empire..

..without anyone's help.

For so many years after father's
death no one inquired..

..whether l was alive or dead.

l did not have any guardian.
l did not have any importance.

And now when everything
was going on fine..

..those companies from abroad..

.. dashed all my hopes and on
the other hand my own people,

Oh yes, my own people are
not ready to help me out.

Don't worry.
God will surely guide you through.

lf Deedar Singh doesn't agree
to sell off his land..

.. we will get his land
acquired and..

..will definitely achieve
our goals.

You are on my side, isn't it?

You will see that in
times to come..

H & M Company will be famous
in every city. l assure you.

How are you Dev?
You don't look good Dev.

Why, what is wrong with me.
l am perfectly okay.

That's rude now.

Yes, l am rude.

l am, what l am.

You are not going to live the
whole of your life with me.

What? Dev!

Nothing.

Tell me, what is wrong.

What happened?

Talk to me.

l am a businessman,
a successful one.

l intend to start a new business.

But no one understands me here
-all of them misunderstand me.

That doesn't matter.

l know just one thing,
if you are doing the right thing..

..then nothing is difficult.

Right thing? What wrong am
l doing? What do you mean?

From the CEO of a pharmaceutical
company..

..to the CEO of a Distillery.

What a transformation, Dev?

On one hand pharmaceutical
companies..

..and on the other
hand distillery.

What a contrast?

This is also a business! lf l
don't do it, somebody else will.

Why do you want to be
responsible for it?

Look at the difference
between what..

..l am doing and what
you are doing?

The Sixth River.

What is this Sixth River you
are talking about girl?

Punjab, the land of Five Rivers.

And the Sixth River of Punjabis..
Punjabis like you, Dev.

You are trying to poison this
river by helping people..

..with the distilleries.

First,
the agriculture, then the youth..

..what more will alcohol consume?

Has not Punjab had enough?

Enough Carrie enough!
l have had enough of this Carrie.

Shamsher, what you are talking
about is difficult for us.

Jagbir,
nothing is difficult for you.

Friend, you are an MLA. Moreover..

..the issue with us is
of great importance.

Look here, if you propose to
the Government to acquire..

..Deedar Singh's land it will
benefit the people around.

The unemployed will
get employment..

..and you will get
applause for it.

Come here Himmat!

l have heard that nowadays
you are..

..attending Deedar
Singh's classes..

You spend a lot of time there.

Be careful, lest it should have
a negative impact on you.

Okay, Jagbir, l leave now.
Will call you later.

Okay.

Yes, is everybody ready?

Yes, Sir.

Absolutely? -Yes Sir.

Strong hands? -Yes Sir.

Full determination? -Yes Sir.

See, this exercise is imperative
for teamwork.

Today you will come to have
trust for each other.

lf you have build the trust today,
it will be there forever.

Do you trust them? -Yes Sir.

They are your friends,
your fellows, okay?

Yes, Rana, go!

Good! Next.

Very good!

Next.

Very good!

Himmat, what have you done?
You have betrayed his faith.

lt is essential to have
trust in a leader.

Do you think that now Angad will
ever be able to trust you?

This is the problem
with our country.

Our leaders commit
gross mistakes..

..for which people have
to pay a heavy price.

lt is very necessary for a
leader to be trustworthy.

Trust?
ln you Sir? How can we trust you?

You sermonise about leadership
here in the University.

But l am really sorry to say,
Sir..

..do you yourself practice
what you..

..preach in your leadership
lectures?

l don't get it boy,
what are you trying to say?

Sir, why won't a leader wish that
his people should have jobs?

Sir, you told us that a good
leader is never selfish.

He always thinks of the
welfare of his people.

He can't be selfish.

Then, Sir, how is it that
a person like you..

..who talks at length about
leadership, could go wrong?

How can we trust you, Sir?

Hey, what are you saying?

Doesn't matter.
Son, what are you trying to say?

Feel free to speak openly.

Sir, if, for the welfare of
people, someone wants..

..to purchase your land
to build a factory..

..wants to provide employment
to the people in your area..

..what is wrong with that?

What kind of factory?

lt can be for any product?

What kind of factory?

l agree, it is a distillery,
a liquor factory.

But just think that
how many people..

..are going to benefit from it?

How many people are going to get
livelihood because of it?

For the benefit of a few hundred,
should..

.. we sow the seeds
of destruction..

..of hundred thousands of homes?

Good, very good, sounds good.

A person who is visiting from a
foreign land is talking great!

You just tell me your purpose.

ls your concern to get the liquor
shops of Punjab closed..

..or do you want to stop only this
distillery from coming up?

Sir, you were talking about
forming our party..

..why don't you make it?

But tell me from where will we
get money for the elections?

What do you think Fateh Singh ji..

..from where does the money
for the elections come?

This game is not easy.

lt is a river of fire,
you will have to dive into it.

Fateh ji, you should persuade
your Grandpa to agree..

.. for the sale of the land-it
will benefit everybody.

Money can be managed
and elections..

..too can be contested and won.

My friend Ranjit,
you are very lucky.

You got the opportunity
to live on this land.

Even l was born here, but
livelihood was destined elsewhere.

Punjab is the land of five rivers,
and the Sixth River..

..for the Sixth River you
have to make a choice.

This river gives life,
doesn't destroy it.

The decision rests with you,
whether you yourself ..

..become the Sixth River..

.. and infuse life in Punjab,
the land of The Gurus..

..or let it be doomed to death
in the river of intoxicants!

The onus lies on you.

lntentions shape up desires.

They have to be strengthened
with fortitude,

So that they flow uninterrupted
despite obstructions!

lf a person starts his work
with determination..

..'Chatrik' says..

..that even God cannot stop his
from the fruits of hard labor.

Oh my God! You scared me!

l thought you were a brave girl!

That l am!

Are you not scared of anyone?

Forget it!
How do you like it here?

Thank you so much for letting
me stay with you.

lt is always my pleasure.

So someone has fallen in love,
it seems. Hmm?

Falling in love is
thing of the past.

lt is better to be in love.

That is cool. So you know what
you are doing, right?

Fateh, l like Dev.

He is a good boy.
l will be fine. Don't worry.

lf you can make up your mind..

..for someone you haven't
seen for ten years..

.. well Dev and l have spent
some time together.

Even if he has some
of his faults..

..isn't love all about accepting
people as they are?

That is right. You know,
if you feel that the person..

..you love is going astray then
you should point it out.

That's real test of love.

Sat Sri Akal, Brother!

Come Killa..

..you are here again to irritate
me with your idle talk!

Sir, it is high time to drink
milk and eat coagulated milk.

Sir, l have heard that
you have met the MLA?

Then sir, it will become very
interesting -But be careful..

..there are many people around
you to fail your scheme.

Moreover,
brother, your idea is grand..

..cocaine in the guise of liquor!

Moreover, now Dev is with us too!

lt will be very interesting.

lt means brother,
we will eat the cake..

..and have it too.
lt will be very enjoyable!

Killia, Killia, you are an idiot.

How many times l have told you
to tone down your voice.

lf someone hears it,
you will be buried alive.

Oh Sir, no one can harm us here.

Moreover, we are doing something
good, nothing bad.

See, here the farmer is
distressed, the youth is unhappy..

.. there is no employment..

..and people don't get
much from agriculture.

lf at this time of sorrow..

..we offer them some
wine and poppy husk.

We are certainly not
doing any harm.

We are doing them good, Sir!

O Killia, these things are not
as easy as they seem to be..

..but Shamsher Singh will
definitely do it.

l don't know what
is American Date?

How many people do you think are
involved in this business?

lt is a full-fledged mafia.

This is what l have heard.

But l had no idea that they
were hiding in our house.

They smuggle drugs under
the cover of alcohol..

..and make them available
in every village.

l could never imagine that Dev
will be party to this..

.. our own Dev,
my childhood friend.

This is how he has reciprocated
to my friendship?

lf someone listens to this story..

..then no body will ever
trust one's friend.

He told me that he wanted
to do business.

l was going to ask Grandpa
to give his land to him.

He is our own fellow.

Such a great betrayal?
Such a big plan?

lt will be a liquor shop
dealing in drugs.

We may be mistaken.
We should talk to Dev.

There is no need to tell or
ask anything from anyone.

l will see to it that how
he does this business?

Fateh, if you too get enraged
and confront him in anger..

..then what is the difference
between you and him?

Moreover, just think, if
educated people like you

And your father go abroad
and don't look back..

.. then how easy it would
be for the enemies..

..to weaken the roots of this
land by poisoning our youth.

lt is nobody else's fault,
Fateh, but our own.

lt is our home,
and we have to take care of it.

Then what should l do?

Along a small line,
draw a bigger one.

A person judges others
by his own parameters.

How wrong l had been!

You are right, Fateh. Perhaps
this is our biggest mistake.

Moreover, how can one human
being be like the other?

You are the resident of
a developed country..

..whereas we are the humble
natives of a very small country.

Don't twist the matter.
l am talking about your plans.

What were you lacking that you
indulged in such activities?

Do you need.. ?

Just a minute Fateh! Don't talk
with me in this language..

..as if to oblige me. l hate it.

l don't need anything from you.

l only thought about the land..

How dare you think that we..

What is wrong with it?
lt is a business?

You are also a businessman.

And a man like you..

..whose father left his father
here for 25 years..

..for the sake of his business .

lt is not a big deal! l am only..

lt is not an understatement that..

..he can even sell off his father.
-Dev!

That which exists seems bitter.

That which does not exist
seems sweet to you.

The whole situation seemed
to be plotting against me.

l had no idea about
the conspiracy..

.. that the enemy had been
planning to execute through me.

My own people were unaware
of the fact..

..that l had no role to
play in this scheme.

Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

Carrie!

Oh, now you don't have any time
even to respond to my hello?

Hello!

l had presented you something.
You haven't valued it.

You haven't valued it at all!

l am going to the city for a day..

..will you accompany me or not?

l am asking you something.

l told you l am busy.

So are you.
Are you not doing strange jobs?

Okay,
all this attitude because of..

..my conflict with your friend!

And now you are repeating
his words!

What about our friendship?

Dev.

Who are these people you
are working with?

Why?

They don't seem to be right people
to me. -Do you trust me? Then..

You don't have time for me.
We can talk.

So the bottom line is that you
wanted to teach me a lesson.

Don't do it to me again, never.
l love you, damn it!

You are welcome to this special
Punjab program. -Today..

..we will introduce you to the
Punjabis, the natives of Punjab.

Do you know that where, in lndia..

..are the maximum HlV
positive cases..

..caused by intravenous drugs?

l know, Mumbai.

You will be surprised to know..

..that in one of the cities of
your own Punjab, Amritsar..

..there are maximum number
of HlV cases.

Tell me the reason.

My son is suffering because
of intravenous drugs.

We are helpless. -He went to
the city and got addicted.

Now we are paying the price.

Hello!

Hello, how far have you succeeded
in the mission?

You are very slow.

Sir, you have to contest the
elections and win as well.

Moreover, Sir, how will you
fulfill people's dreams..

..when you have not
been able to get..

..the liquor factories started?

Sir, only if we bribe people
with food and liquor..

..then they will vote
in our favor.

Moreover, the rest of the
game is being spoiled..

..by your daughter on the TV.

Sir,
she is your daughter and you..

..are responsible for her deeds.

Just switch on your TV and see.

Who is responsible for the present
condition of Punjab?

Don't forget to see,
tomorrow, at this very time..

..the last episode of 'Punjab
Special Program'.

Ms. Carol Smith, from America..

..our special guest of the day
will talk on this subject.

Killa, tell Maan Sahib that
it won't take us long..

..to reach the desired goal.
Believe me.

We have full faith in you,
Shamsher Singh ji.

Father! Which destination
is being talked about?

Mind your own business.

Where are you going?

Studio.

You will not step out
of this house.

Why father!
You can't do this to me.

l am your father.

Enough of this drama!

From now you will not talk
about any leader..

..or politician of Punjab
on the channel.

Do you understand?

l am to contest the elections,
if you continue like this..

..then no party will give me the..

..ticket to contest the elections.

Father! l have always obeyed you.

During the last five days you have
stopped me from everything.

Don't talk about 84,
it is controversial..

..don't touch the topic
of hypocrite Babas..

..how do they harm you?

Don't talk about farmer's suicide,
why are you bothered?

Don't talk about drugs.

Why can't l talk about drugs,
Papa? Why?

l should talk only about giddha,
bhangra, makki di roti..

..and sarson da saag?

Why don't you speak?

Why should l be quiet so
that no one comes..

..to know about your misdeeds..

.. and one more corrupt leader
wins people's votes..

..by bribing them with drugs?

Reet!

You would have borne the burden
of even seven sons..

Were you not content with
slapping my womb?

Gurjit!

You killed three daughters
in my womb, Sardar ji.

Then you did not even let me cry.

And now if you kill my grown up
daughter, l won't keep quiet.

No, l won't be quiet.

The one who went away crying
while departing..

-Move ahead, Reet.

Not even mother could
console her.

Not even mother could
console her.

Reet!

Waiting for the sun
with tearful eyes?

Light emerges out of darkness,
Reet.

Have courage. l am with you.

Wake up! Wake up!

Let not the night pass
away in slumber.

There is not going to
be another chance..

..to enjoy the bounties here.

Wake up! Wake up!

Dev!

Should l raise the curtains?

No.

You like to be in the dark now?

Yes, that is my problem.

Why are you doing this?

What have l done?

You are teaming up with
the wrong people.

l don't need your lecture.

lf you don't approve,
you can go back and leave me here.

Otherwise also,
it is the nature of white girls..

..that they can't stay with
one person for a long time.

l had heard it,
now l have seen it.

Mr. Dev..

..you may say that American girls
are not faithful to their men..

.. but l have not known
a man so unfaithful..

..to the land he belongs to.

And one more thing, l don't know
about other American girls..

..but my Mom said..

..when you love someone,
despite all their faults..

.. accept them.

And l came here today,
despite knowing everything,

l came here to say that l..

Sometimes you forget that what
is the right thing to do..

..and that is why even
the light hurts you.

l hope you understand before
it is too late.

Remember Dev,
we have only one life to live.

Are you up Son?
Dev, what is going on?

You must be wrong somewhere.

That is why people are
unhappy with you.

You too mother?

This is extreme!

What have l done?

Have l murdered someone?
What crime have l committed?

l only wanted to start a business.

lf my own people can't help me..

..l am going to seek
help from others.

But!

l am telling you that it will
be done, don't worry..

hmm. Okay.

Let us go Uncle,
l have been insulted enough.

Come, let us accomplish the job.

What are you looking at?

You are the one who guided me.

No one understands me here.
Let us go.

l don't understand, what are you
looking at? Let us go. Okay!

Forget it. l will do it alone.

God becomes merciful,
one meets with the Guru..

..who takes him by the arm..

..and lifts him out, says Nanak.

..and lifts him out, says Nanak.

Get away, you crazy man!
What do you want?

lf l remain indifferent and
don't express my concern,

ln spirit like existence,
they will keep on wandering,

How will then l recognize
these changed faces?

The sun itself will gulp away
the bright daylight,

Nothing will then survive
in these circumstances.

Alas! What is this route taken
up by The Sixth River!

Stop Son! Don't go.

lt is 4pm.
Any news from Shamsher Singh?

No news from him, Sir.

lt was after hard work
of 4 months..

..that we could entrap this boy.

Now all our efforts are ruined.

Solved any problem?

This is what l have achieved after
the hard work of a week.

Hmm.

Moreover, to me it seems..

..that the white girl has been
sent here to expose us.

And Dev? He does not know
anything about our plans.

On the contrary, he will help us.

Oh Sir, Dev knows nothing
about our drug business.

He thinks that we deal in liquor.

And Sir..

..if you feel that our secrets
should remain concealed..

..then we have to adopt
tough means.

Killa, first of all, get that
white girl out of our way.

This is a business,
not a frivolous joke.

l can't afford any risk.
Do you understand?

Killa, catch him!

Move on fast!

Fateh, reach fast near
the Civil Hospital.

Carrie's life is in danger.
Come fast!

Hit him

Get up, hey you big bull!

Hit him on the head!

Dev, go to Carrie!

Go Dev, l will manage!

Sometimes you forget what the
right thing is, Mr. Dev.

That's why even light hurts you.

An evil leader takes complete
control over people's thoughts.

l pleaded, but time never stopped.

l tried to hold it back,
but it slipped away.

Dev!

Who are these people you
are working with?

You have to guide people
so that they can use..

..their own intelligence
and understanding.

Be cautious and watchful
of the passing time..

..it does not know how
to stand still.

Once it is gone,
it does not come back.

What were you lacking so that you
indulged in such activities?

Punjab, the land of five rivers..

..and The Sixth River
is of the Punjabis .

Remember Dev,
we have only one life to live.

Thank God!

What is it Dev?

l thank You hundred
thousand times.

l am glad you are here.
My Sixth River is almost finished.

Only the last chapter
is incomplete.

Carrie!

Carrie, where are you? We are
waiting for you in the studio.

Hello!

lf you leave him,
he will cry a lot.

You will look funny crying!

Dev, where is Carrie?

Roll camera! Action!

My name is Hardev Malhotra.

l am that Sixth River born out
of the five rivers of Punjab..

..which had gone astray.

The girl who showed me the
right path disappeared..

..from my life right
in front of my eyes.

ln her words..

..l make an appeal, to every
Punjabi, living in Punjab..

..or outside Punjab.

lf you come to have
the conviction..

..that you are the Sixth River..

..then you will also come
to have the sense..

..of responsibility of being
the inheritors of this land.

lt is too late for me
as l have already..

..lost my most dear possession.

But you still have time.

Looking around it
seemed that the..

..ever-enthusiastic
spirit of the..

..Punjabis would soon
have an upper hand..

..over the (so called)
Sixth River of drugs.

lt was not enough for
Fateh and myself.

lt seemed as if the wrong things
were getting eliminated.

But eliminating wrong
does not mean..

..that good will automatically
happen.

Fateh was perturbed about the
empty frame in the University.

l was concerned about
the last unfinished..

..chapter of Carrie's book.

Fateh opened many leadership
schools in Punjab.

Ranjit formed The Nishkaam

And then Fateh went back to
Philadelphia after having promised

Reet to come back next year.

Fateh had rightly told his Father
-he had sown the seeds.

And now every six months
some Fateh comes..

.. from abroad and waters
the plants of Punjab..

..and again goes back
to the foreign land.

l too,
at times water these plants.

Preet was blessed with
a daughter next year.

Deedar Singh again fried jalebies.

Shamsher Singh distributed
jalebies among all his neighbors.
