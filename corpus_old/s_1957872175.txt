[whimsical music]

I pledge allegiance to the flag <i>
of the United States of America,</i></i>

<i>and to the Republic,</i><i>
for which it stands,</i>

<i>one Nation under God,</i><i>
indivisible,</i>

<i>with liberty</i><i>
and justice for all.</i>

[fanfare music]

My fellow citizens,
our nation has been faced

with a dramatic increase
in terrorism and crime.

That all stops now.

From now on,
there will be no pardons.

There will be no excuses

for anyone bringing
terror into this state.

I attended
this execution to prove

to the people
of Florida that I believe

in real punishment,
not empty words.

Fuck you!

Governor, Carol Burke, FSN.
Is the state of Florida

-getting into show business?
-No, Carol.

Marty Rockman is a responsible
television producer.

These people came
to my office with this idea

of <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>
I thought it fit in

perfectly with
the war against crime

that I've been
leading in our state.

That's it. Thank you very much.

[theme music]

I'm Marty Rockman.

I own this station.

But more significantly,
I'm American.

And, like you, I am outraged

by the escalating crime

that threatens
our civil existence.

To be honest,
our justice system has failed.

You know it, I know it.

Crime goes unpunished.

Criminals go free.

I'm prepared
to offer you change.

With the cooperation
of our Governor

from the great state
of Florida, I'm prepared

to give justice back
to you, the citizen,

by simply to put justice
back into your hands.

Here's what I'm gonna do.

We're gonna televise
criminal trials

in a three hour format, live.

And at the end of that trial,
you, the viewer,

will get to vote
guilt or innocence.

If you vote guilty
in a murder trial,

I'm gonna televise
the execution.

Our first trial is
Friday night at seven.

Justice finally for real.

<i>Citizen Verdict...</i>Be there.

That's right. You, the public,</i>

<i>will decide which of these</i><i>
three accused murderers,</i>

<i>now awaiting trial</i><i>
in Florida, will be</i>

<i>the first defendant</i><i>
on</i>Citizen Verdict.

<i>To vote log on to</i><i>
www.citizenverdict.com.</i>

I rather for it to be
with the 12 man jury

while they're sitting there,
they can see the emotions,

they can, they can see
everything and then,

instead of somebody just on TV,
"Oh, he's not guilty."

Cause they got a whole
bunch of mystery shows on TV,

and you can sit back and pick,
"Oh, he's guilty. She's guilty."

You'll be there and see
the actual evidence yourself.

I think any time you
have the general population

making the decision
rather than a handful
of people who have been tweaked

by prosecutors
and defense attorneys,

you're not better off.

It would definitely...

...definitely be big.
I know that. Um...

I'll most definitely watch it.

If it's not corrupt,

I think it would be
a wonderful idea.

The problem is a practitioner
that I have with it...

simply is, uh...

You're risking
due process violations,

um, on a regular basis
in a trial

that you show on television,

um, under those circumstances.

And I'm not sure
if that is worth the gamble.

I, I feel that most of

the majority
of the reality shows

that are out today
are truly exploiting.

I think it's
a very strong system,

uh, considering
that the United States has,

uh, diversity of population.

And being a huge country,

they have
to have a powerful system

to control the crime.

I think in the, uh, the,

the system is designed
in a way where they can--

It's a demographical situation.

And they can get, they can,
they can go to a certain area

and get the type
of people that they want,

and bring on a jury,
and get the verdict they want.

So of course I would like
the, the mass of people.

[opening music]

Good evening.

We're here with Marty Rockman,

better known
for the hit reality show,

<i>So Sue Me.</i>

Marty, I gotta
tell you, [laughs]

call it cheesy, I don't care,

but I watch <i>
So Sue Me</i>all the time.

Well, thank you very much.

So tell me about your new show,

<i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

Love to do that.
I'd love to do it.

You know, Marty, it is causing

a lot of controversy down here

with the public
and in the media.

As expected.

And it's set down in Florida?

It's not set in Florida,
it happens in Florida

because we're dealing here
with real people
and real justice.

And you're gonna show
real murder trials in Florida?

In Tampa.

And all registered
Florida voters

who watch the show are
eligible to vote on the jury?

That's right. In fact,
we've even set up a system

to make sure
that no one votes twice.

Okay. Let's see
what the Republican Governor

of California,
Charlie Behr, has to say.

Good evening, Governor.

Hello, Troy.

Governor, what is your take

on what's happening
down in Florida?

It's a circus down there.

<i>Citizen Verdict</i>has nothing
to do with justice or democracy.

It's a political trick.

But more important,
in my opinion,

is that it goes
against everything

that the Constitution
of the United States stands for.

Excuse me, Governor.

No, you wait.

Your show is an insult

to the citizens of this country,

Trialing people,
and if convicted, having them

executed on television,
what are you trying to do?

Bring us down to the level
of Iran or Iraq?

And I'm warning you
for the last time,

I've consulted
with my fellow governors

and some of the finest lawyers
in this country,

and we intend to obtain
an injunction to stop

your show from going on the air.

Run for president on somebody
else's time, Governor.

I'm promising you this,
you might as well write it down

nothing and nobody

bring on all
the lawyers you want,

nothing is gonna
stop <i>Citizen Verdict</i>

from bringing justice
to the American people.

Marty? What is
this bullshit about a lawsuit?

Is Governor Behr
trying to kill our show?

Relax, Bull. He's just
playing the press.

[Bull laughs]

You don't know
dick about politics.

That man is gonna
challenge me for the primaries.

Your lawyers are gonna
keep me in the loop.

I wanna know everything
that's going on

at every minute. Let's eat.

Oh, this is good.

Excuse me. Thank you.

So...

How's the voting go?

Well, I can tell you
who's gonna win.

Ricky Carr is way
out ahead in the vote.

Of course, it's a...
it's celebrity murder.

Well, Dolly Hamilton, let's
face it, she was an icon.

What kind of numbers
are we looking at?

Four million,
maybe five, in Florida

-in terms of the viewers.
-Listen, Marty...

Don't fuck up.

This has got to be a good thing
for the state of Florida

and the United States.
Got to be done right.

If this young punk walks,
if this case doesn't hold

I'm gonna look
like a wimpy asshole.

My neck's on the line
just as much as yours is.

Everything's covered.

I'm counting on you.

[Sam coaching football]

-[woman] Come on!
-[people cheer]

-Do you wanna drink, Sarah?
-Yeah.

-Let's go
-Seven-five.

-[smacks leg]
-[man] Let's go.

Come on. Go, guys!



-Go, Bobby!
-[crowd cheering]

Yes! That's
what I'm talking about.

[cheers and applause]

Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

Do you live with your dad?

-No, I live with my mom.
-Okay.

I think your dad is
such a great teacher.


I can't believe he's
gonna do that show, though.

-I think it's excellent.
-You do?

-That's what I'm talking about.
-Sure.

Ah, Hail Mary,
I'm taking y'all to the bowl.

-Daddy!
-I don't know what bowl that is,

but I'm gonna
take you all anyway.

Where are you, baby?
Hey, sweetie.

Are you all right? [kisses]

Where's mama?

I don't know.

You wanna go sailing today?

Mr. Patterson, can I
talk to you for a minute?

Yeah.

Don't you need
an assistant for the show?

Someone to do your research.

Anything.

I'm, uh, what's you name again?

-Carlene.
-Carlene! Carlene.

I'll tell you what.
Let me think about it, huh?

Why don't you
give me your rÃ©sumÃ©?

-I'll do that.
-All right.

-Thanks.
-Thank you.

[melancholic music]

[pulling the hand brake]


Hey!

I thought I told you
to send me a rÃ©sumÃ©.

I really wanna do this.


-You wanna be a lawyer, huh?
-Yeah.

Well, have a little respect
for your clients, will you?

I mean, if you ever show up here
again looking like a stripper

from Pompano Beach, I'm gonna
put your ass right out of here.

Are we agreed on that?

Okay.

All right, come on up.

Alright. Memorize that.

Apparently every legal procedure
there is in a book
for trial by television.

Mr. Patterson, I'm Mike.
Follow me. Bob White
is waiting for you.

Mr. Patterson.

Fabulous to meet you.

-Carlene Osway.
-Bob White.

Welcome to <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

If you follow me
to your offices.

This is [unintelligible]
on the right over here.

I've read
all your cases by the way.

I'm a big fan of yours.
I really am.

Oh, this is Andre.

Andre, how you doing?

Got the right
helping attitude.

[through a mic] <i>
You you're off</i><i>
for the rock and one up.</i>

Bad, huh?

Freedom?

Oh, right away. Sam, Mr. Rockman

needs to see you
right away, sir.

[funky music]

[Marty on the wire] <i>
All right, Sam.</i><i>
This is important.</i>

I got a ton of money
invested in the show.

I got a Governor
trying to shut us down,

a guy running for president

who's been on my case
the whole time.

So, number one,

you never talk to the press.

All statements run through me.

Got it? I got to keep
consistency of message.

And, number two,
this is show business.

I didn't hire you just
because you're great attorney.

You've got to sell this thing.

Alright. Put it down.
Out of here. Out.

[talk through high speaker]

Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars to your account.

Perfect. I'm on the case.

It's always
about the money, isn't?
I know where you're coming from.

I got two ex-wives.
They're tapping me for money.

Not one would get a fucking job.

Jessica, want to meet
your opposition?

-Sam Patterson, Jessica Landers.
-How're you?

I studied a lot
of your cases in college.

Your career used
to be very impressive.

Well, I've seen you on TV.
Very effective.

I love how you guys are beating
the crap out of each other.

But you know what?
Save it for the fellas.

-Good luck.
-Good luck.

Good. Come with me, Sam.
I'm gonna make you

look like a lawyer now.
Remember it's show business.

Ladies, say "Hi"
to Sam Patterson.

Okay, we gotta
dress him up in a suit.

Make him look like a lawyer.

What you got? I like that.

All right, That'll work.
We can work with that.

Hmm. The other one over there.
The other one.

You know what,
dive in your own time.
Get him another?

Yellow tie working
with blue shirt.

Sam, if you were a woman,

I'd fuck you.

[funky music]

Now you're looking
like a TV lawyer, huh?

-[Rockman] Judge Halvern,
Sam Patterson.
-Nice to meet you, Sam

-How're you?
-Uh, Jessica.

Okay, do you jump up?
Come on, let's walk.

That's it. Right.

Smile for me, will you?


[photographer 2]
Hey, Sam you're just [inaudible]

-Sam?
-Hey!

Put it up for this one.
Smile, Sam.

-It's all part of a lie.
-How are you? How are you?

-[man] You look good.
-Thank you. Thank you.

Hey, hey! Get out of there, huh.

No questions please.

[camera clicks]

What's up with the dress?

I just wanted to be on TV.

You are now, honey.

-Hey, Sam!
-Good, good, good.

Marty, I'm sorry.
This's my assistant, Carlene.

Marty, Carlene.
Carlene, this is Marty.

-Mr. Rockman.
-I'd like to, uh,
talk to my star.


[camera clicks]

Come on.
This is your night, huh?

Someone I want you
to meet here.

I think you're gonna like this.

Governor, how're you?

I'd like you
to meet Sam Patterson.

Of course!

I knew your father.

What do you think
of all this, Sam?

What do you want me to say?

If I'm a law professor,

and, and my understanding is,

uh, Mr. Patterson
is a law professor,

uh, and, and well respected

as a defense lawyer
in his entire career,

I'm not sure
if taking this gamble

uh, [stutters]
would be something

that I would wanna risk,

tarnishing, uh, what I've
accomplished all those years.

[theme music]

Congratulations, Florida.</i>

<i>Your choice is Ricky Carr,</i>

<i>the accused killer</i><i>
of Dolly Hamilton.</i>

<i>Tune in on November 12th</i><i>
for</i>Citizen Verdict.

[alarm wailing]

[keys turning]

[heavy door opens]

Mr. Carr, I'm Mr. Patterson.

This is my assistant,
Carlene Osway.

Wanna sit down?

Where are you from, buddy?

-Florida.
-How old are you?

-Twenty-eight.
-Where do you work?

-New York.
-Where in New York?

Starrett City.

Do you like baseball?

Yeah. I like baseball.

So, Carr, you're a prostitute.

You got a record
the size of Starrett City.

And I've examined
this case from top to bottom.

Should I be here right now?

I told my story
to the cops a 1000 times.

Do you wanna tell me
you history?

'Cause that's why we're here.

Why don't you tell me
how much the TV company's
paying you to represent me?

I ain't getting paid
by you, son.

All right, thanks for your time.

Mr. Patterson?

You wouldn't believe
my story if I told you.

[melancholic music]


I was just sitting
at the bar having a drink.

The place is called Chucho's.

I always go there
on a Friday night.

That's when she came in.

Dolly Hamilton.

She's coming on
straight away, you know?

Pushy.

She puts...

She puts
a 100 dollars into my...

on my dick.

She wants me to fuck
in the car, like, right now.

That's what she wanted.

The car was parked
right outside the club.

And...

We drive someplace quiet.
She says she wants

to fuck tough
right there in the car.

Wants me to rip her up a bit.

You know, and I said
that's no big deal,

as long as no cops are around.

We fuck, and she
gives me 300 more.

End of story.

Then she came back a week later.

This, like, happened every week

for, like, three weeks
maybe, you know?

Always in the outfield.

Always someplace quiet, dark.

And that night...

...we went down
to a parking garage.

She said she
wanted it rough, you know?

Blood, pain and that shit.

And I'm not into that, yeah?

But then she didn't wanna pay.

So she takes my hand,

and she puts it on the blade

and gets me fucking her.

And she's getting into it.


The blade's right
up here on her throat.



And then
it kind of just went in.


And then the blood.


Just waiting for you there.

I was so freaked I just...

I just ran fast.



Fucked up.

I took her necklace too.

I wasn't even thinking
straight. I just needed

the dough
and I took the necklace.

I didn't even know
I had the blade in my hand

till I got back to my place.

Then it was too late.


[seagulls cawing]

No, no, no way.
You cannot do this.

-He might be innocent
and I need time.
-Absolutely not.

You think I'm gonna
give you time to slime up

-Dolly Hamilton's character?
-Are we talking

-about justice here?
-Oh, come on, Sam.

I am talking about justice.

Well, how about talking about
some due process of law?

Due process? You know
that my case is airtight.

-If we had the surveillance
tape, it'd just be one--
-I don't know what the hell

you're you talking about now.
No one's talking about tapes.

You haven't talked to the cops.

You know, this is
beginning to sound

real goddamn convenient to me.

This was not factored
into the deal here.

Sam, I cannot
give you any more time

according to the rules.

-Marty?
-Sam, I'd love to help you.

But we're locked into the 12th.

I got a network on me a PR
machine, not to mention

Governor Behr trying
to shut the whole thing down.

If you need some help,
tell me what you need.

Oh, shit.

Give me some more, huh?

This is beginning to hurt.

Hi, Dad!

Hey, baby. How are you, huh?

-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetie.

Hi, how're you doing?

Yeah, I'm alright.

I saw you on TV.

Quite a PR campaign.

Yeah.

What are you trying to prove

that you haven't already?

I-- Who are
you trying to impress?

Remember to bring
Sarah's computer?

Don't change the subject.

And, please, look at me
when you're talking to me.

What do you want from me, huh?

You wanted a divorce,

you got a divorce.

You wanted the house,

you got the house.

-Now what else do
you want from me, Mmh?
-Sam...

You've forgotten
who you really are

and people
who really care for you.

You lost me to your career.

What do you think
your daughter's gonna think

when she sees you
on that stupid TV show?

Please, don't ever question
my integrity as a father, Anna,

or as a lawyer for that matter.

Please, huh? It's beneath you.

Anyway, you're gonna do
what you want. You always have.

Look.

My parents want
to have a dinner at the house

next week for Sarah's birthday.

They want you there.

That's great.

Now that I'm on TV,
I get invited for dinner, huh?

Yeah, whatever.

Bye.

[melancholic music]

[elevator beep]

-Mr. Patterson.
-Hey! Thank you for meeting
with me, Michael.

No problem. Follow me.

-So these are
the production offices, huh?
-That's right.

-How long've you worked for her?
-Three long years.

For low, low wages
and lots of abuse.

Hello, darling.

What did you do for her,
Michael? You were
a production designer?

Production designer, made
secretary, housewife. All that.

-Yeah. All that stuff, huh?
-Yeah.

-You know her will?
-Oh, yeah.

I thought it was
kind of hard to miss.

-Yeah?
-Especially when you work
for the bitch.

You think she had
much of a personal life?

No. Cooking, cooking, cooking.

You don't think
she had any boyfriends?

-Boyfriends? Dolly?
-Yeah.

-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?

-Or you don't know?
-I don't know.

And I don't want to know. Okay?

I understand.

So how are you?

How am I? Um...

[clicks tongue]

Well, I...

I can't go out of my house.

I can't open the front door
without a camera in my face,

without a, a camera
in my, uh, children's faces.

So, um...

Yeah, uh, that's, uh...

-That's how I am...
-Yeah. Okay.

Um, you know, I know this
is a difficult time for you.

Um...

But, um, I'm gonna
have to ask you some...

...questions about Dolly.

Um...

Personal questions.

Dolly was um...

You know, she was just herself.

She was... she was
what everybody is on, on TV.

Yeah, sure.

Um...

The thing is...

Um...

Something came up in a meeting
with the defense attorney.

Um... In trial they're
gonna try to introduce some...

...terrible things about Dolly.

Um...

Sexual things.

[tense music]

What...

What kind of sexual things
are they talking about?

They are alleging that Dolly

frequented bars and indulged

in sadomasochistic sex
with male prostitutes.

Ms. Landers, I want you
to go out there...

...and make sure that man dies.

Television lies.
Television, the, the media

only gives you half the story,
and they'll blow it up,
and give you something else.

You won't be getting the full
truth, so, I'm not gonna rely

on what the media say.
I need to find out for myself.

I need to get the, the
information on the case myself,

and see what's really going on.
Because the media television is

just a big-- most
of that stuff, whatever is
just a big lie anyway.

So I, I'm not
gonna go with that.

There's too much, uh,
expansions with the media.

Whether it be television,
newspapers, radio.

Uh, by the time they,
they get somebody to trial,

they're guilty
or they're innocent.

We've seen that every day.

[lively music]

[background chatter]

Diet coke. No ice.

It's not like this in here
every night, is it?

-What?
-It's like a tomb in here.

I know you.
You're the hot shot from TV.

You a friend of Ricky?

Yeah. I know Ricky.

-He's a good kid.
-No kidding.

-Hard worker.
-I'll bet.

You know Dolly?

Maybe. Maybe not.

Never is not too good.


This will fit your job.

You think about that.

-[woman] Hi, honey.
-Evening, girls.


Hey, mister!

You're Sam Patterson?

No, maybe I'm Lincoln.

So, go on.

Oh, she picked me up
at the bar one night.

When was that?

About six months back.

We ended up in this dive motel.

You had sex with this woman?

Yeah, man.
We had fucking weird sex.

She was into pain.

Blood and all kinds of shit.

the fuck out of me.

-You'd say this in court?
-Oh, yeah.

Yeah. For 25 grand.

-Not gonna do that.
-Sure you can.

I've seen it on TV all the time.

A man's life depends on this.
You're gonna have to testify.

Look, man, I know
being on TV means money.

If you help me....

-I help you.
-You're gonna testify.

Or I'm gonna subpoena your ass.

I'll nail you to court
for the next ten years.

Yeah, whatever.

If you wanna my help Mister...

...you know where I am.

[tense music]

[siren blaring]


-[Carlene] <i>
What're you gonna do about this?</i>
-Just a second, sweetie.

This is daddy. You wanna
call me back at the cell phone?

-Do you want me to organize--
-Give me a goddamn minute!

I'm trying to reach my kid.

Honey, this is daddy. Call me
back on my cell, please, right?

Please, as soon as you can.

Carlene, I'm sorry, all right?

I'm just tired.

-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

[keyboard clacking]

[knock on the door]

Come on in.

Hey, Sam. How's it going?

Lousy.

Wanna talk about it?

This case is going nowhere.</i>

[signal glitching]

[phone rings]

-Yeah.
-[Carlene] <i>Sam.</i>

<i>He'll testify.</i>

You're shooting me.

<i>I did it. I convinced him.</i>

Well, this was excellent.

That's excellent news.

<i>Shall I set up a meeting?</i>

Good. Good work. Well...

-You get back to me
on that, right? <i>
-Speak to you later.</i>

-Good.
-[turns off the phone]

It looks like
we're back in business.

-Good evening. I'm Jeff Solway.
-And I'm Tawny Scott.

Welcome to <i>Citizen Verdict,</i>
where you are the jury.

-[cheering]
-This is Didi Ray,
reporting live,

outside the <i>Citizen Verdict</i>
studios, in Tampa, Florida...

The crowd, listen
to this hype. It's crazy.

Absolutely wild.

["Take The A Train"
by Billy Strayhorn]

Here we have the prosecuting
attorney, Jessica Landers.

And she has with her in the car

the victim 's husband,
Jack Hamilton.

Oh, my goodness!
Jack, do you think

justice will be served tonight?

I really,
I really have no comment.

Jessica, Jessica,
are you gonna beat Sam tonight?

I'm gonna beat Sam,
and justice will be served,

-and I will be the one doing it.
-Wow!

Oh, my gosh!
And here comes the man himself.

That's exciting,
this wild, wild anticipation.

Sam, this is the premier
of <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

Look at the crowd. Look at
the hype. How are you feeling?

-I can't comment.
-Rumors are flying

that explosive revelations
will be made at the trial.

Can you comment on this?

Good luck, Sam!
This is Didi Ray,

reporting live outside
the <i>Citizen Verdict</i>studios.


What you think,
that trials and executions

will make the United States
more uncivilized?

I don't really think a country
like France has anything

to teach the United States
about a crime rate.

But here in Florida
we're going to take a stand
against the crime rate.

And <i>Citizen Verdict</i>
is just the tool we need.

<i>Bon soir.</i>


-Marty.
-Welcome, Governor.

This is it, huh?

This is history.

America at its finest.

[distant cheering]

[Citizen Verdict opening music]



Tonight's case is
The People versus Ricky Carr.

Here comes the defendant,
who is accused of the rape

and first degree murder
of Dolly Hamilton.

-Here's how it will go.
-The trial will
last three hours.

After that, you will
have one hour to reach

your verdict
before the lines shut down.

When you call, simply follow
the automated instructions

or log onto the website
www.citizenverdict.com.

The accounting firm
of Cost Anderson

will monitor
and certify the voting.

A unanimous result
is of course not possible.

And so the defendant can only
be found guilty if more than 75%

-of you reach that decision.
-Presiding at tonight's trial

Judge Thomas A. Halvern.

All rise for the honorable
Judge Thomas A. Halvern.

Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

Before we begin...

...I ask you to remember
that you are watching

this trial on television...

...but it is real.

A man is on trial
for a real crime.

It is your solemn duty

to observe the proceedings
without bias.

Each and every one of you,
the jury, must watch

every moment of this trial

and pay close attention
to everything

you see and hear.

Remember...

You will be
sitting in judgment

at the conclusion of this trial.

Come on, Judge. Pick it up.

I call upon the prosecution

to make their opening statement.

Thank you, your Honor.

Dolly Hamilton. [chuckles]

Who could forget that smile?

Well, she brought
America into our home...

...taught us the pleasures of
good, plain, American cooking.

She wrote books...

...had her own magazine.

She was a TV icon.

Dolly Hamilton was someone I,


we all aspired to be.

She was a loving mother...

...a devoted wife.

Dolly Hamilton was an ideal...

...for millions of Americans.





You know what?

Dolly won't be coming
home for Christmas this year.

Or next year.

Or ever again.

Because one night...

...the dream...

...was over.

Dolly's life
was brutally cut short

when Ricky Carr attacked,

viciously raped
and murdered her.

And for what? A necklace.


We will show irrefutable
DNA and forensic evidence,

Ricky Carr's fingerprints
on her vehicle,

and the murder weapon.

Jurors... this is
an open and shut case.

The prosecution will prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

that Ricky Carr is guilty

of rape,

first degree murder,

and deserves
to be sentenced to death.

[background chatter]

Well, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

I have to congratulate you.

Because you're the first.

You're the first
television jury system

in the history of this nation

to ever try a case.

That's phenomenal.

That is an astonishing...

...responsibility.

It's an astonishing opportunity.


This is exciting.

This is exciting.


a question to you. Why do we
love our children so much?

They play, don't they?

They experiment.

You know, when you bring
a kid into the world,

you want to be
the total manifestation

of your hopes...
and your values.

You live with that inherent
obligation and privilege

to never fail that child.

You never fail that child.

I feel that way about democracy.

I feel that way
about this justice system.

This is a phenomenon.

This justice system.

It's like a child.

It's always challenging us.
It's always growing.

It's always evolving.
It's always questioning us.

It's demanding the best of us.

But we still live
with the obligation

to never fail that child.

You just don't do that.



I'm the defense attorney here.

If I fail before you,
I fail before this nation.

But my client,

Ricky Dean Carr, has already

admitted to the killing
of Dolly.

He admitted it.

It was an accident.

[background chatter]

It was a tragic accident.

I'm sorry.

[clicks tongue] Shit.

Where is the video?

-Here, sir.
-Where?

Yeah. Could you just...

Could you, please,
put, put a, a...

Where's Dolly? Come on.

Get Dolly up there.

Where is Dolly?

Hello, Dolly. There she is.

I want to tell you a story.

About seven years ago, I am
in the middle of a divorce,

I'm sitting in my boat,
it's all I have left.

I'm watching one
of these little televisions,

on comes Dolly.

Now I wanna tell you something.

Dolly represented to me

everything at that moment

that I was lacking in my life.

You know what?

Where is that camera
that looks like an octopus?

Octopus who? Let--

Hey, honey, bring that
camera over here, will you?

-Put the camera to him.
-Get it on her.

Put the octopus in her face.

Come on, get it up there.

Tonight we're gonna
listen to testimony...

...that damns this woman,

that vilifies
that lacerates this face

<i>that we all love and adore.</i>


We have to sit
through witnesses.

And the state will try to prove

that my client, Ricky Carr,

raped and murdered
Mrs. Hamilton...

...and they'll fail.

It was an accident.

Thank you.

Wow, wow, wow! We were promised
some explosive evidence,

and it looks like
we're going to get it.

-What do you think, Jeff?
-I think you're right, Tony.

This is going to be
a really tough case.

Obviously a big fight
is in the works.

Well, the opening statements are
complete, and after the break

the prosecution
will present its case.

Stay with us.</i>



So, this proves conclusively
that the semen samples

taken from inside Mrs. Hamilton
comes from the defendant.

I consider 1 in 12 billion
to be conclusive, yes.

Thank you.

Defense's witness.

Well, this certainly sounds

conclusive, Mr. Doby.

But the DNA proved
that it was rape.

There was definite
trauma present.

I'd say rape is
a strong possibility.

Possibility or certainty?

-Possibility.
-Possible is not for certain,

is it, Mr. Doby?

-No.
-Thank you.
No further questions.

Redirect, your Honor.
From your experience,

how often do these signs
of trauma indicate rape?

-95% of the time.
-[Sam] Objection, your Honor.

There's no corroborating
proof to back these statistics.

-[judge] Ms. Landers.
-Withdraw the question.

Mr. Doby...

...how long have you been
a forensics expert?

-Eighteen years.
-And when you offer an opinion,

as you just did,
even if it entails conjecture,

-is it based on your
experience as a forensic--
-Objection, your Honor.

She's just manipulated
the previous question.

95% is not good enough.
Could be 40.

Could be 60. Could be 10.
Can you prove me wrong?

Your Honor,
Mr. Patterson is out of order.

-He's using his objection--
-No, you're out of order.

...manipulating this television.
And I'll not allow it.

-And I'll not stand for it.
-Yes.

-[Sam] You should know better--
-Enough!

Objection sustained.

You're both grandstanding

and I will not tolerate it.

Go on, Ms. Landers.

Thank you sir. The prosecution

calls Jack Hamilton.

Thank you, Mr. Doby.

Jay, close up.

Tighter two...


Mr. Hamilton,
I'm sorry about your loss.

America loved your late wife.

But I'm gonna have to ask you
some difficult questions.

Mr. Hamilton...

I'm sure you've heard
the stories about Dolly

circulating in the,
shall we say,

-trashier end of the press.
-[sighs]

Is it conceivable... at all...

...that there is any truth

to these abhorrent rumors?

Absolutely not.

wonderful woman in the world.

-I don't know how I'm gonna
live without her.
-[Sam] Objection, your Honor.

This, this is
completely irrelevant.

-That piece of shit
over there raped my wife--
-[judge] Mr. Hamilton.

Please, control yourself.

Your Honor,
the defense has told us
in their opening statement

that their case
is circumstantial.

They have warned the jury
that they will try

to attack
Dolly Hamilton's character.

Now I believe in my obligation
to present an objective picture.

And who better to do it
than Dolly Hamilton's husband,

who knew and lived
with her for 30 years.

-Fair is fair, your Honor.
-[judge] Objection overruled.

Go on. Miss Landers.

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Hamilton, you were
telling us about your wife.

[clicks tongue and sighs]

I, I have just lost my wife.

My children have
just lost their mother.


the finest woman I ever knew.

[sniffs and sobs]


No further questions.

-[judge] Mr. Patterson.
-No.

No further questions,
your Honor.


Mr. Turner, how did
you meet Mrs. Hamilton?


She picked me up
in a bar one night.

Took me to this,
uh, motel nearby.

Tell us what occurred, sir.

Uh, well, we started
to fuck, so then she--

Mr. Turner,
you're in a court of law.

Now kindly answer the question
without profanity.

Yeah. Okay, sure. Um...

We started to, uh, make love.

And then she handed me
these cuffs. All that stuff.

-What stuff sir?
-Wanted me to handcuff her
to the bed. Uh...

Then she wanted to be burned
with cigarettes on her, uh...

You know? She was in a...

-[crowd shouts]
-[Landers] Objection,
your Honor.

You Honor,
this is a valid testimony
to corroborate my client's case.

My apologies to this court.

-[judge] Objection overruled.
-Are you sure you want me

to say all this shit in court?

Now, Mr. Turner,
you've been warned.

-Continue, sir.
-[Turner] Okay. Yeah.

So, well then, she,
she wanted me to fu-- uh,

make love to her.

-She wanted it up the ass.
-Objection!

you had no time

to prepare your witness
for this case.

Now, kindly do
something about it.

Or I'll hold
your witness in contempt.

Basically,
what you're saying, Mr. Turner,

is that you had
sadomasochistic relations

with this woman,
is that correct, sir?

-Sado what?
-No further questions.

-Ms. Landers.
-Your Honor, I will not dignify

this witness
with a cross examination.

There is no proof
to back up his story.

And so I see no reason
why his testimony

should be entered
into the record.

Very well,
Miss Landers, however,

Mr. Turner's testimony
will stand.

[tense music]

[unintelligible chatter]

Mr. Carr, you've heard the
testimony here of Mr. Turner.

-Sound familiar?
-Yeah.

Could you tell the court,
in your own words now,

how you came to meet...
Mrs. Hamilton?

Um, I went to this bar, that--

Court will take a short recess.

Councils...

In my chambers, now.

What's going on now?

I'll find out. You stay here.

[unintelligible chatter]

-What the hell is going on here?
-I just received
the missing surveillance tape.

Lieutenant Joe Cook, Tampa PD.
How do you do, sir?

-[judge] Play it, bailiff.
-[Marty] Sorry.


[tense music]

No way in hell that's going in.

Your Honor,
it's unusual. Maybe if--

[cross-talking]

We're up in 60 seconds.
Make a decision.

A human life is at stake
here for Christ's sake!

Oh yes! Did you take a good
look on what that human life did

-to Dolly Hamilton?
-What the hell
that's supposed to prove?

-What's that prove?
-Shut the fuck up!
We got 49 seconds.

-What's your decision?
-I'm admitting it.

-Let's go.
-You did the right thing, judge.

Well, obviously something very
important just happened then.

That commercial break
was totally unexpected.

-Jeff, have you heard
anything with the booth?
-No, Tony. I haven't.

Wait, we're--
we're going back. It seems--

It seems it seems Judge Halvern
wants to make a statement.

All right.
Let's go back to the trial.

I have some important
instructions for the jury.

The court has
received new evidence.

A video tape quite
graphic in nature,

which has not been verified.

However...

...according to the rules
of <i>Citizen Verdict,</i>

I have the discretion
to admit such a tape.

I have reviewed the tape myself,
and deemed it important enough

to admit it.
A word of warning:

This tape is very graphic

and totally unsuitable
for children to watch.

Oh, that's it.
The kids are going to the house.

Aah!

Your Honor, I put
the strongest objection

to your ruling
on the official record now.

Noted.

Ms. Landers.

Clerk.

Play the tape.

[tense music]

[tense music continues]

Fuck that!

-It fucking proves nothing!
-[judge] Out. Out.

-Out!
-Fuck it!

-Your fucking asshole. Fuck you!
-You get out.

-Who do you think you are?
-[judge] You cannot--

Get out!
Out! Out! Out!

Fuck you. Fucking...

Suck this. All right.

You're my lawyer, man.
Fucking help me.

Fucking help me!

Oh, my gosh.

That was horrible.

Yes.

Words. I, I don't have words.

Wait, it seems we're,
we're going back. Yes.

Yes. We're going back.

Ladies and gentlemen...

...Ricky Carr killed
Dolly Hamilton.

We've presented you
with all the forensic evidence.

But now you've seen
the truth with your own eyes.

Ricky Carr viciously attacked

and raped Dolly Hamilton.

And when he was through,
with no regard

for her life or her family...

...he slit her throat,

ripped off her necklace,

and walked away like an animal,

stealing her...

from her husband...

...her children...

...and an America
that loved her.

It's that simple. [scoffs]

Ricky Carr is guilty as charged.

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I don't know where to begin.

I agreed to take part
in <i>Citizen Verdict</i>

cause I thought
it was a great concept.

Great concept.

It's a concept.

Your Honor...

If this tape...

...is even considered
as evidence...

and brought into this courtroom
at this juncture in time,

this is an atrocity.

This is a travesty.

Where this tape comes from?

Where it comes from?

How bad do you
want an execution here?

How bad do we want an execution?

Because I'm seeing
three executions here.

We have just been witness
to the supposed video execution

of Dolly Hamilton.

We may yet bear
witness to the real

execution of my client here,
Ricky Dean Carr.

But what we're
standing witness to now

is the execution
of a justice system,

that has been tried.

It has been proven,
it has been tested.

It has existed in this nation

for 200 years.

And this...

...this unequivocally eradicates

any notion
of a verdict of guilty

'cause you leave us no choice

but to vote not guilty.

This man has not being pushed
off some, some, some island.

This man is not, not, not
being voted out of a dormitory.

This man is being
voted off the planet.

That's not justice.

That's just television.

That's your legacy.

How dare you?

How dare we?

We vote no.

We vote no.

We vote no.

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the jury, you now have one hour

to consider your verdict.

Well, Florida, you've
heard it loud and clear.

You now have one hour
to review the evidence
and highlights of this trial.

So log on to citizen verdict.com
or call our 1-800 number.

-[background chatter]
-[Tawny] Once you've made your
decision, place your vote.

Now there will be a charge
of $2.99 to go to trial.

A portion of that amount will
go to benefit law enforcement

and crime prevention
here in Florida.

[tense music]

Well, America,
the official numbers are in

from the accounting firm
of Cost Anderson.

Over nine million
people in Florida

have cast their vote tonight.

That's unbelievable.
Those numbers are way above

our most optimistic predictions.

[strikes the gavel]

Will the defendant kindly rise.

May I have the verdict.

It's nail biting time, Tawny.

It certainly is, Jeff.


[crowd chanting]
Guilty! Guilty!

[cheering and clapping]

Whoo!

[tense music]

Ricky Carr...

you've been found guilty
by a jury of your peers.

I hereby sentence you
to death by lethal injection.

May God have mercy on your soul.

[strikes the gavel]

[melancholic music]

Thank you, America.

It's been
a privilege bringing you

the first live televised trial,

where you were the jury.

Join us real soon for the next
edition of <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

Governor! Governor! Governor!

Good evening.

Good evening.

I'm going to be very,
very brief. [exhales]

This evening, the people of
Florida have had an opportunity

to participate
in our new legal system.

Nine million Floridians voted.

And a just verdict was reached.

-Thank you very much.
-[reporters] Governor!
Governor! Governor!

I was very much in favor of the,
the guilty verdict and...

And I do support the,
the death penalty.

I thought the prosecuting
attorney a little tight

in the drawers,
but that's their job.

You know? So...

Law school.

After seeing that video,

-there's no question in my mind.
-[woman exhales]

The tape just
popped up basically.

I'm looking at the guy as far
as innocent at that point.

But after looking at the,

the video cams,

I don't know, it's pretty, it's,
I get mixed feelings there.

[in foreign accent]
And you know what I liked
also about the show?

The spirit of America.

All the flag and the,
the eagle on the ground.

-Mm-hmm.
-That's I like it.

People are voting
just kinda for kicks.

You know, they may not
really be thinking about it

as deeply as if you're
one of 12 people

and you know that your vote
really will count.

I think when it gets to be so
many, it's more of a game.

Sam Patterson
was duped from day one.

Uh, I, I thought that, the,

uh, you know based on what I saw
with the evidence coming in

as it did, this evidence
that was introduced

on the day of trial,
which is absurd.

Uh, you know, [stutters]
that represents the worst

in [stutters] in affording
the defendant due process.

Uh, I'm,
I'm horribly disappointed
in what I saw tonight.

And if this gains momentum,

uh, then I think, uh,

uh, we're in trouble.

[seagulls cawing]

-[Carr cries]
-So you lied about everything?

Yeah.



Rockman told me

that if I did the show

he would help me,

he would give me a story.

Had a chance to get off.

But he told me not
to tell you anything,

that if I did,
I was guaranteed to die.


Don't you see, man?
He fucked us both.

He got both of us, man.

We gotta fucking get this guy.

He's a fucking...

me out of here, man.

I can't take it anymore.

Look at me.

I'm fucking hearing voices, man.

I didn't mean to kill her.

fucking mean to kill her.

It's coming from in here.

I got get out of here, please.

Listen to me, let's fucking
get this son of a bitch.

I don't know why I killed her.


Where are you going?
I need help, man.

-You gotta get me out of here.
-You lied!

You fucking piece of shit.
You lied!

You piece of shit!
You lied to me!

You lied!
You fucking piece of shit.

You killed her!
You killed that woman.

Get the fuck away from me.
You lied!

[tense music]

I guess Marty is calling
a production meeting now.

Yep.

Let's go.

Thank you for your generosity,
Florida.

We have had an unbelievable
amount of calls.

That's right, Tawny.
The number of people

who have called in
to witness this event?

Twelve million.

Well, America, we'll see you
this evening at nine eastern.

The execution of Ricky Carr.

How are you?

I'm good, real good.

Hey, Sam.

Hell of a view.

This is why I was
summoned here?

Oh, Sam's angry.

What's your problem, Sam?

The killer is gonna die.

You are one sick man.

-I'm a sick man?
-Yeah. You're a sick, man.

No, no. You defended a sick man,

and we gave the people
exactly what they wanted.

Yeah, I adjusted it up a little
bit, made a little bit show biz.

But the fact is a killer dies,

and we make a ton
of money. Grow up.

You're a barker.

You're a barker at the circus.

Take care of yourself.

[waves breaking]

Televised?

Nah.

Nah, I don't think
it should be televised now.


If you pay for sex,

why don't you pay
to watch somebody get killed.

They're guilty. Get rid of them.

Don't let them sit on death row.
Waste my money.

In Saudi Arabia?
Yes we have done the sentence

that they
cut their head by a sword.

I am not spe--

specifically in favor
of the death penalty myself.

Uh, I do have a,
a belief that the only person

that is, uh, should [stutters]

allowed to take a life is God.

I try to put myself
in someone else's place,

and if a loved one of mine
was murdered by someone

I would wanna
see that person pay.

It's got to happen.

We need it.

I think we need it very much

and I'm in love with
the death penalty because...

...you know, that put a lot of
fear in a lot of people's heart

by having that death penalty.

Uh, it's clear
that the crime rates

have not been affected,
in the least,

by, violent crime rate,

by the number of executions
that they have somewhere,

that, that they provide
some sort of deterrence.

They do not provide a deterrent.

That's a... clear system.

That's pretty brutal, man.

See somebody die on television.

Nobody don't wanna
die on television

and see all these
people, you know?

All these people on TV, man,
watching somebody die.

[Citizen Verdict theme music]

This afternoon Ricky Carr

was moved
from his death row cell

to the execution
observation area.

The prisoner is kept
in the observation area, so

that he may be watched
carefully during his last hours,

in order to prevent
any attempt at suicide.

The execution observation area

is where he will
have his last meal

before being moved and prepped
for his execution.

And of course you'll be able
to watch all of his movements

thanks to our carefully placed
cameras in the execution area.

[unintelligible chatter]

[melancholic music]

Yes, Florida. Tonight
you will see a live execution

for the first time ever
in the history of television.

That's right Tawney. Exactly
nine p.m. Eastern Standard time

Ricky Carr will be
executed by lethal injection.

Last night Ricky Carr
was served his last meal.

We were told he chose steak
and chocolate cake.

Ricky also had a visit
from his parish priest

where they reflected on some
scripture from <i>The Bible.</i>

The images <i>Citizen Verdict</i>
is bringing you

of the execution are exclusive.

No other filming
or photography is authorized.

mind at this moment.

Tonight, for the first time</i>

<i>in the history of our country,</i>

<i>a sentence of execution was <i>
carried out and broadcast live.</i></i>

<i>It gave me no joy.</i>

<i>I've been your Governor</i><i>
for the last three terms.</i>

<i>But I address you</i><i>
tonight as a fellow citizen</i>

<i>and as an American.</i>

<i>I pray that God will allow us</i>

<i>and show us the way back</i>

<i>to the foundations</i><i>
that we love and cherish.</i>

<i>The future</i><i>
of our children is at stake.</i>

<i>Good night,</i>

<i>and God bless America.</i>

[sad music]

Uh, seeing it live,
uh, on television

the way we did, uh,
it didn't bother me any,

but I, I'm wondering about,

uh, I really think
that perhaps it,

it's traumatic to a lot
of people who may have,

uh, voted guilty
and paid to watch

the execution, but really
they couldn't handle it...

...emotionally as, as well
as they thought they could.

Did I like the execution?

There was, just,
it was horrible.

There was nothing
to like, I just was,

it was just too real and...

I, it really upset me terribly.

And it was almost an invasion
of his privacy. Even though he--

I thought he was
so guilty and so horrible

but just the idea of...

...watching him die was
just really tragic I thought.

-[Marty] <i>Hello.</i>
-[Sam] <i>Hey, Marty.</i>

<i>-Yeah.</i><i>
-I need you to meet me</i><i>
at the studio right now.</i>

Have I interrupted something?

Never mind
what you're interrupting.

It's two o'clock
in the fucking morning.

Get to the point.

What do you want?

-You remember
what we talked about?
-No, I don't remember

-what we talked about.
-The deal.

The deal is I pay you
eight million dollars a year,

and you do your fucking job.

Two hundred and forty million
dollars pay per view, Marty.

It's a lot of money.

I want 25% of the show.

And why would I pay that much?

-What I know.
-Sam,

aren't you forgetting something?

He's dead.

Who's gonna back to your story?

I will.

And...

...you'll also give me 25%.

The kids wanna leave the sandbox

and go play with the big boys.

Don't ever try to play me.

Save it, Marty.

This is no game.

-You need us.
-You?

You stupid little bitch.

I made you.

If it wasn't for me,

you'd be working in some
shitty little court house,

earning crap.

Lawyers, dime a dozen

replace you just like that.

No, Marty... you can't.

We're the ones
that America loves.

It's our faces
they see in their homes.

We argued the case.


You are the show.

No! Fuck no!

I'm the show.

I created this.

This was my idea.

My vision.

This is how we fight
crime in America.

I thought of this.

And it works.
It works, doesn't it?

Two hundred and forty
million dollars?

It works.

You bullshit lawyers.

Ah, this system is what?
Justice?

It isn't justice.

It's a lottery
system you got here.

It's like a game of chance.

You've committed
crime in America?

The chances are
pretty good you won't be caught.

You get caught?
The chances are pretty good
you won't be convicted.

And if you're convicted,

there's a good chance
you don't go to jail.

And you go to jail...

...chances are pretty good
you're gonna be out of there

before the tears dry.

You fail.

You fail.
The American People know that.

That's why they love our show.

That's why they love
Marty Rockman. Now...

...I did play a bit
with the evidence.

Yes, I messed around
a little bit with the trial

and I did lie to Ricky Carr.
Big fucking deal.

He's dead
and he deserved to die.

He's a killer.

And the people wanted him dead.

I, Marty Rockman,
gave them what they wanted.

And that's why they love me.

Television. Television.

That's God.

And I pull the strings.

Don't you ever fuck
with Marty Rockman.

[melancholic music]

Well, I suppose that goes
for your cops as well.

Yeah.

Everybody's got a price.

Me too.

It's all on tape.

[door opens]


[clicks tongue] Marty... [sighs]

I told you right from the start.

You gotta do this thing right.

You didn't do it right.

Get him out of here.

What?

What are you doing? Hey!

Bullshit, get the fuck off me.

I'm Marty Rockman.

Get off me! Get-- get--

This is my temple. My church!

Sam, you're a fucker!

[cross-talking]

And so today Marty Rockman was
indicted on several charges

of bribery and obstruction
of justice.

Ironically, he was brought here

[cross-talking]

...following his trial
on <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

It's just another blow
for Rockman

whose staggering fall
from the limelight

began with the announcement
from Governor Tyler

that brought the show
to its end.

This is Carol Burke for FSN.

As a practitioner, I think
that the system works... uh...

I think that...
from time to time

you get judges
and prosecutors,

who perhaps are...

Prosecutors are,
who or overzealous

and judges
who may be a little lax in
interpreting the Constitution.

Uh... Uh...

But, all in all, based on
what I see in my everyday work,

I believe the system works.

You don't take a soap company,

to create a soap opera.

But the people
who wrote the Constitution

of the United States

fled persecution.

It wasn't a soap opera.

They were fighting for their
fundamental belief systems,

their fundamental
belief systems.

Justice is not a commodity.

It can't be negotiated.

It can't be merchandised.

And you to
stand here right now
and allow this appetite of ours

for new technologies,
for ratings, for numbers.

We allow
that appetite to consume

our fundamental
belief systems...

...our individual liberties...

...our freedoms.

And you know what?

I'd rather you all go out
right now become missionaries.

I mean it. Become missionaries.

Because I want you to believe.

I want you to believe.

I want you to believe
in this Constitution.

I want you to believe
in this democracy.

I want you to believe
in yourselves.

Believe in yourselves.

People, today...

...you're about
to take an oath.

An oath is something sacred.

If you'd all just
oblige me now to stand.

I do solemnly swear.

I do solemnly swear.

To support the Constitution
of the United States of America.

That I'll support
the Constitution
of the United States of America.

And to support the Constitution
of the state of Florida.

And the Constitution
of the state of Florida.

That I'll maintain the respect
to the courts of justice.

That I'll maintain the respect
to the courts of justice.

And judicial offices.

And judicial offices.

So help me God.

So help me God.
