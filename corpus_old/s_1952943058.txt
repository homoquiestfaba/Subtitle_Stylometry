<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

<i>You can see it in her style</i>

<i>You can see it in her smile</i>

<i>You can see it in her flair</i>

<i>And the way she wears her hair</i>

<i>Spinning</i>

<i>Twirling</i>

<i>Girly</i>

<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

<i>She doesn't need a crown</i>

<i>You can tell she's a princess</i>

<i>She'll turn the world around</i>

<i>Her shoulders are back
Na, na, na</i>

<i>You'll never see her slack
No, no, no</i>

<i>And even if she falls
Na, na, na</i>

<i>She'll laugh and stand up tall
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

<i>You can tell she's a princess
Yeah, yeah</i>

<i>She doesn't need a crown
No, no</i>

<i>You can tell she's a princess
Yeah, yeah</i>

<i>She'll turn the world around
Yeah, yeah</i>

<i>But the secret to her majesty</i>

<i>That sets the girl apart</i>

<i>Is the kindness
that shows royalty</i>

<i>It's etched upon her heart</i>

<i>And welcome back!</i>

<i>Andrea and I are
thrilled to be here</i>

<i>bringing you the 144th
Princess Procession!</i>

<i>That's right, Phil! And where
are those princesses processing?</i>

<i>Glad you
asked, Andrea.</i>

<i>Why, to Princess
Charm School, of course,</i>

<i>"Where Glorious Girls
Meet Dreams Of Destiny!"</i>

<i>Emily!</i>

<i>I hope you're doing your homework
and not just watching that parade!</i>

I am, Mom!

<i>Yes, every girl dreams it,
but only a few can achieve it.</i>

<i>For those born to royalty
from kingdoms far and wide,</i>

<i>a chance to earn their
titles as princesses.</i>

<i>And for
those born commoners,</i>

<i>the opportunity to win a place as
a princess' most trusted advisor,</i>

<i>a lady royal!</i>

Boo!

<i>Blair! You're here!</i>

<i>Dance with me,
Princess Emily.</i>

<i>Oh, Phil, it's a beautiful
day here in Gardania,</i>

<i>I've never seen so many
people for the parade!</i>

<i>I know, Andrea. You couldn't be
more right. It's a lovely day,</i>

<i>everybody's having
a wonderful time...</i>

<i>You'll hurt your
eyes looking at this.</i>

Let me get your tiara,
Princess Blair.

I am so
not a princess.

<i>...costumes are magnificent.
They are indeed, Phil.</i>

<i>Every girl's a princess.</i>

Some of them just
have fancier crowns.

<i>Fuchsia.
It's just adorable.</i>

<i>Mom okay?</i>

<i>Kind of. The doctor says
she's comfortable.</i>

Comfortable.

She should be all better.

<i>She'll get
there, though.</i>

I just have to
keep working.

Then we can afford our own
little house in a better area.

<i>With better
doctors for Mom?</i>

Mmm-hmm, and a better
place for you to grow up.

Some place right out of
the pictures you draw.

Blair?

Hi, Mom! I brought
you a blueberry scone.

Oh, thank you.

<i>It's the least I can do.</i>

<i>It's time!
It's time! It's time!</i>

<i>It's Princess Charm
School lottery time!</i>

<i>We have to watch!</i>

<i>And now we'll hear from
Headmistress Alexandra Privet.</i>

<i>At Princess Charm School,</i>

<i>those born to the royal life
unlock their princess potential.</i>

<i>Yet every year, one
regular citizen of Gardania</i>

<i>wins a full scholarship
to the school,</i>

<i>with a chance to
become a lady royal</i>

<i>and change
her life forever.</i>

<i>Will it be you?</i>

Oh, I hope,
I hope, I hope.

Did I mention I hope?

<i>When you're old enough
you'll enter. I promise.</i>

<i>To choose this year's
lottery winner,</i>

<i>I present Miss
Delancy Devin.</i>

<i>You of course mean
Princess Delancy Devin.</i>

<i>My daughter will soon
be ruler of Gardania.</i>

Provided she successfully
completes the semester.

Miss Delancy?

<i>Blair Willows.</i>

<i>And there
you have it!</i>

<i>Blair Willows! This year's
winner... Yes! I knew it!</i>

<i>Woo-hoo!
What? But...</i>

<i>Who's a lady royal?
Blair's a lady royal!</i>

<i>Emily, that's not possible.
Who works in the palace?</i>

Blair works in the palace!

Uh-huh, go Blair!
I never even...

Uh-huh, go Blair!

You
entered for me?

Only five or six times.

A day. For an entire year.

<i>Who's gonna be a lady royal?</i>

<i>Blair's gonna be a lady royal! Emily!</i>

<i>They're here?</i>

<i>They're really here!</i>

Mom?

<i>Blair Willows?</i>

<i>Congratulations. I'm here to
take you to Princess Charm School.</i>

<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

<i>There's been a mistake.</i>

<i>I'm not going to
Princess Charm School.</i>

<i>Yes, you are!</i>

<i>Emily, I don't belong with a bunch
of princesses and lady royals.</i>

<i>Look at me!
I'm a waitress!</i>

<i>I've got straws in my pocket
and ketchup on my socks.</i>

You look perfect.

<i>Thank you. But the girls
there won't think so.</i>

And I have
responsibilities here.

<i>Blair, it wasn't right of
Emily to go behind your back,</i>

but this is a
big opportunity.

A position as
a lady royal?

<i>Would change
our lives forever.</i>

<i>I'll go.</i>

Yes!

<i>Wow, you get to
ride in a carriage!</i>

<i>It's time to go.
Now?</i>

Now.

<i>Uh... Just let me pull
together some clothes and I...</i>

<i>It's all at
the school.</i>

<i>We need to leave now, or
you forfeit your scholarship.</i>

But what about my...

Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock.

I love you.

<i>I won't let you down.</i>

<i>Blair!</i>

<i>Blair!</i>

Goodbye!
Goodbye!

<i>Bye, Mom!
Bye, Emily!</i>

Goodbye, Blair!

<i>You'll always be my princess.</i>

Ah! Great!

<i>I've already flunked
carriage riding.</i>

<i>Whoa.</i>

Thanks for the ride.

Uh, hey, I wonder if
you could maybe show me...

Oh.

Or not.

Ooh!
Hey!

Pardon me.

You scared me!

<i>Aww, it's okay.
You're a good dog.</i>

<i>"Prince. "</i>

Good boy, Prince.

<i>Hmm. You must
be Blair Willows.</i>

<i>We don't usually find our future
lady royals sprawled on the floor.</i>

Oh! Um, hi.

Sorry about the floor.

<i>He's just...
He's very sweet.</i>

<i>Not usually.
He's normally quite shy.</i>

Go lie down, Prince.

I am Headmistress Privet.

<i>Welcome to
Charm School.</i>

<i>Thank you.
It's really an honor.</i>

Shall I take you
to your locker?

Princess Charm School was
founded on the principles

of instilling young women
with character and confidence.

And it has been preparing them for
royal life for nearly five centuries.

<i>Wow.</i>

<i>Emily would love this.</i>

<i>She's always wanted
to come here.</i>

<i>Emily?</i>

<i>My little sister. She's the one
who entered me in the lottery.</i>

I never would
have come,

<i>but it's a chance to make a
better life for her and for my mom.</i>

Ah.

Blair, only 27% of the lottery
girls make it through to graduation.

Do you think
you can handle it?

<i>I think so. I'll sure try.</i>

<i>You'll notice that
all of our students</i>

carry themselves with dignity
and sophistication.

<i>Weekly
dress-up tea socials!</i>

Yes! And we can give each other
fun nicknames and swap shoes!

<i>Shh, ladies.</i>

<i>Dress up tea socials in
our dorm room every week!</i>

This is the original
Princess Charm School.

The centuries-old castle.

Most classes and the student
dorms are in our new section.

Our world-class
amenities

include a state-of-the-art
digital classroom.

To your left, our
Olympic-sized ballroom.

And my personal favorite,
our luxurious spa.

I do enjoy a good
mani-pedi from time to time.

<i>Blair Willows!
Ah. Here we are.</i>

<i>Blair Willows!</i>

<i>Anyone seen a
"Blair Willows"?</i>

<i>At your service, miss?</i>

This is Grace.

Your personal
princess assistant.

<i>Every student at Princess
Charm School has one.</i>

They are usually punctual,
and usually helpful.

I shall leave you in her...
Capable hands.

I am so sorry.

It was buttercream.

<i>Now if someone spills a pot roast
on me, I'll be a complete meal.</i>

I just wanted to give you the
traditional welcome cupcake.

You wanna change
clothes? Follow me.

It has everything a
princess student needs.

Books, pens, paper,
make-up mirrors,

sparkle purse
collection.

And of course
emergency pumps.

This is my locker?

<i>Then we've got
your beauty supplies.</i>

Jewel-encrusted hairbrush,
diamond lipstick.

Oh, I love this perfume! Ooh!

Ugh!

Ugh!

<i>I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.</i>

Um, Delancy?

<i>There's such a thing
as too much perfume.</i>

Portia!

<i>Oh, no, you're...</i>

<i>Furious, that's
what I am!</i>

How dare you?

<i>Look, Delancy. They're
serving floor cakes.</i>

I just got here.

You just got here?

Let me guess.

<i>Blair Willows,
the lottery girl?</i>

Yes! So you understand.

Oh, this is all so new to me, and I...

I understand the
lottery is a joke.

<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

<i>Commoners like you
don't belong here.</i>

<i>Right, Portia?</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Wickellia!</i>

<i>Yes, Your Wonderful...
Ness.</i>

I need a princess
pamper package, pronto!

Make way!
To the spa!

Uh, are you
taking orders?

Because I would do anything
for a double foam mocha latte.

The floorcake
was delicious.

<i>Portia!</i>

As you can see,
everyone here is so nice.

Most of the time.

<i>Uh, so let's get
you ready for school.</i>

Locker, please extend
curtain for a princess primp.

<i>Oh, it's fabulous!</i>

The best thing about
Princess Charm School!

Go on. Get gorgeous!

Oh, pretty as a princess.

Lady royal.

<i>Okay, now your schedule
and let's get you settled.</i>

<i>I'd love to.</i>

<i>Wow.</i>

Hey! Our new roomie, right?

Princess or lady royal?

Lady royal. You?

Princess.
Isla, too.

Do you play?

<i>Nice.</i>

Oh!

<i>Oh! I'm so sorry!</i>

Are you kidding?

<i>Isla's been Miss
Mum's-The-Word about the tunes</i>

<i>and I've been
dying to hear them!</i>

<i>I'm still working
on them.</i>

<i>They're not ready
for anyone to hear.</i>

<i>Really? What I heard rocked.</i>

Yeah! See? Play one
of your tunes for us!

<i>That's okay. No rush.</i>

<i>I'm Hadley.
Blair.</i>

<i>Blair Willows?
The lottery winner?</i>

Is it that obvious?

<i>Yup, 'cause they
announced it on TV</i>

<i>that "Blair Willows"
was the lottery winner.</i>

Oh, right. Sorry.

<i>Guess I'm just a
little overwhelmed.</i>

<i>All princesses and
lady-royals-in-training</i>

<i>are due at the Starlight
Welcome in one minute.</i>

One minute?

<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>Welcome, students.</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>And dogs.</i>

<i>Tonight you begin the greatest
challenge of your life,</i>

<i>training to be a
princess or lady royal,</i>

<i>the most important
jobs of the realm.</i>

<i>Your classmates, Lorraine and Josette,
are bringing around your training tiaras.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Don't get
too used to them.</i>

<i>Only those who succeed this
semester will earn the real versions.</i>

<i>Fail as a princess-in-training
and you will not be crowned.</i>

<i>We have very high
expectations here.</i>

<i>Each of you must attend every
class on time and in uniform,</i>

<i>and your grades must
be exceptional.</i>

<i>That said, I believe every one
of you has princess potential.</i>

<i>Work hard and
stay dedicated,</i>

<i>and you will achieve it.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry,
Dame Devin,</i>

<i>that's a nasty little
tickle there,</i>

would you like a
glass of water?

<i>I'd like a
proper introduction.</i>

<i>Certainly.</i>

Students.

Dame Devin.

<i>I have an earth-shattering
announcement.</i>

<i>This is my last semester
of teaching before I...</i>

<i>Um, before my daughter
takes over Gardania.</i>

<i>No, no, hold
back your tears.</i>

<i>Ms. Privet will take over
my classes next year.</i>

<i>In her own little way.</i>

<i>Of course, no one knows
the royal life as I do.</i>

<i>I've lived at the
palace ever since</i>

<i>my dear sister-in-law Queen
Isabella and her family died,</i>

<i>and it has been my
great... If they died...</i>

You know the legend?

<i>What legend?</i>

<i>There's a legend that
Queen Isabella and her family</i>

<i>didn't all die
in the accident.</i>

I love that you
know that story.

<i>...and so I welcome you all
to Princess Charm School.</i>

<i>May your time
here be magical.</i>

<i>Two lines, everyone!</i>

<i>Curtseys to all and then
everyone's excused for bed.</i>

<i>Favorite legend about
the Gardania Royal Family, go.</i>

<i>I don't know any
of the legends.</i>

So missing out.

Isla, go.

<i>My fave's a simple one.</i>

<i>Gardania's magical crown.</i>

<i>Gardania's magical
crown?</i>

<i>Ow!</i>

<i>Oh, no.</i>

Ugh! You again?

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>What is with you?
You're a walking disaster!</i>

<i>I don't think Delancy and I
are going to hang out much.</i>

<i>That's okay, you'll be
hanging out with us.</i>

Better believe it. And wait
till classes start tomorrow.

I bet you can do
anything she can do.

Sure, I can do
anything she can do.

I cannot do
anything she can do.

Poise. Proper poise
commands respect,

a necessity for anyone
in the royal life.

Thank you, Delancy.

Now, princesses,
lady royals,

<i>let's see what
you can do, hmm.</i>

Start with one book
and glide, glide.

Smoothly, gracefully.

I can balance a tray of coffee
cups for customers, right?

<i>Of course, I've never
done it on my head.</i>

<i>Hadley, you're tenderizing
your brains. Stop.</i>

<i>That's lovely, Isla.</i>

Thank you,
Dame Devin.

If you want to be the crazy
princess who hears music in her head.

<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>Lorraine, you're practicing
poise, not lifting weights.</i>

Like a princess, Josette,
not a migrating duck.

Portia.

<i>What?</i>

<i>You're
doing fine.</i>

Come on. Come on!

<i>Do it for Emily.</i>

Did you get those
shoes at a garage sale?

Is it nap time?

How come
nobody told me?

<i>You. What do you have
to say for this disaster?</i>

It was an
accident, Dame Devin.

I was trying...
Stand up.

<i>You're the lottery
girl, aren't you?</i>

Yes, Dame Devin.

I should have known.
Meet my eyes, girl.

A true lady royal
never hangs her head.

Mother? You were going
to say something to Blair?

Yes!

You are utterly unfit
for the royal life!

<i>I want you out
of this class!</i>

You might also think about whether
someone from your station in life

<i>should even stay someplace where
you so clearly don't belong!</i>

I understand.

<i>They're serving
strawberry swirl today!</i>

Thank you, Miranda.

<i>Don't let Dame Devin bug you.</i>

<i>Legend has it she's
actually a reptile alien</i>

from the other side
of the universe.

You know what really
bugs me, Portia?

Yodeling hand puppets?

<i>When a commoner like Blair
comes to Princess Charm School,</i>

she makes it less special.

She makes us
less special.

She does?

She totally does.

Specialness is like
this piece of cake.

<i>There's only so
much to go around.</i>

If Blair takes a
huge chunk of it,

<i>what's left for us?</i>

You stole my cake!

Not me.

Blair!

How dare she!
I wanted that cake.

<i>Don't worry. I have
a feeling she won't</i>

be around to steal
cake much longer.

<i>Wickellia!</i>

<i>Yes, your
Royal Sneakiness?</i>

<i>So we're coming around showing
everyone our school spirit cheer.</i>

<i>'Cause when
you've got spirit,</i>

<i>it's what we
want to hear!</i>

Thanks, Lorraine. Josette.

<i>Yeah. That was cute.
Rhyming and all.</i>

<i>We'll see ya.</i>

<i>Oh, that wasn't the cheer.
Had to make that clear.</i>

<i>But don't you
ever fear.</i>

<i>'Cause the time
to cheer is here!</i>

One, two, three!

Princess Charm
School is the best!

<i>Royal skills put
to the test!</i>

<i>We can dance and
we've got poise!</i>

<i>Now it's time to
make some noise!</i>

<i>Go, Princess Charm School!</i>

<i>Wow. Cool cheer.
Thanks for sharing.</i>

Part of caring!

You guys ready?

<i>I'm so sorry... I...</i>

I have to go.

Serves her right
for stealing my cake.

<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

<i>I don't fit in
here at all.</i>

<i>I'm like a burp
in a symphony.</i>

You have to give
yourself more time.

<i>You're right.
With more time,</i>

maybe I could destroy
the whole school.

<i>No, Dame Devin's right,</i>

<i>I'm not Princess
Charm School material.</i>

Seriously? Blair.

Dame Devin was Princess
Charm School material.

<i>What do you mean?</i>

Oh, I know this story!

She was a lottery winner, but no
princess picked her to be a lady royal,

not even her sister-in-law,
Queen Isabella.

<i>Exactly. If Delancy weren't
in line for the throne,</i>

Dame Devin would be no more
special than anyone else.

<i>Wow.</i>

<i>But
it's not just her.</i>

<i>Everyone thinks I
don't belong here.</i>

<i>Everyone except you guys.</i>

<i>A little help,
please?</i>

Ooh, care package!

<i>It's for you from...
Emily Willows?</i>

<i>Emily? Really?</i>

<i>That's pretty.</i>

<i>Emily drew it.</i>

<i>She loved the story of me being
found on my mom's doorstep.</i>

I was only one.

<i>Mom adopted Emily
a few years later.</i>

<i>They're everything
to me.</i>

<i>One-two-three,
one-two-three,</i>

one-two-three,
one-two-three,

one-two-three,
one-two-three,

and one-two-three,
one-two-three,

one-two-three,
one-two-three... Ow.

<i>Again, Blair?</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>You've stepped on
eight of my toes!</i>

I only have four left!

Two. You have two left.

<i>That's even worse!</i>

Thank you, everyone.
See you tomorrow.

Not you, Blair.

<i>I'd like to see
you after class.</i>

<i>Well, isn't
that a surprise?</i>

<i>Is...
Is everything okay?</i>

<i>No, it's not, Blair.</i>

Yesterday Dame Devin
recommended we expel you.

Oh.

<i>I can't say I blame her.</i>

<i>I know it's only been a
couple of days, but honestly,</i>

<i>I don't think
I have ever seen</i>

such a disaster of a student
come through these halls.

I see.

Tell you the truth,
I was almost going to do it.

<i>Did you say "almost"?</i>

<i>Almost.</i>

Do you know what it
takes to make a princess?

A crown?
No, not a crown.

Character.

All our classes in
poise, manners, dancing,

<i>they're not superficial.</i>

They build confidence.

But confidence without
character is dangerous.

You, Blair, have
a different problem.

Character without
confidence.

So you are going
to expel me?

<i>I'm going to tutor you.</i>

If you can dig deep and
find the princess inside you,

<i>I have no doubt
you'll graduate</i>

with your pick of any
lady royal position.

If you can
handle it.

Now, what
do you say?

Yes!

Ooh!

Uh, rule number one,
no hugging the tutor.

<i>Sorry. I just...
When do we start?</i>

<i>Right now.</i>

I can do this because I
am perfectly comfortable

and at ease with myself and in my body.

<i>That's because you're not
surrounded by people</i>

who make you feel like
a complete nothing.

No one can make you feel
inferior without your consent.

<i>Right. Your turn.</i>

<i>Headmistress Privet,
there's no way I can do this.</i>

<i>Not if you don't
believe you can.</i>

<i>We start small.</i>

Thirty seconds,
right here on the ground.

<i>That's right.
Just like that.</i>

<i>I can't.
I can't do it.</i>

Yeah, of course
you can...

<i>Right. I see we have our
work cut out for us.</i>

<i>I don't have the balance</i>

<i>Think I'm gonna fall</i>

<i>Wish I had the talent</i>

<i>I don't belong here at all</i>

<i>Drowning in the pressure</i>

<i>In over my head</i>

<i>Why did I think
I could do this</i>

<i>I could have
walked away instead</i>

<i>This is my chance
to break free</i>

<i>Everything's depending on me</i>

<i>And if I keep trying I'll be</i>

<i>On top of the world</i>

<i>Where I can see
everything before me</i>

<i>Reaching up to
touch the sky</i>

<i>On top of the world</i>

<i>All my dreams are
rushing toward me</i>

<i>Stretching out my wings to fly</i>

<i>On top of the world</i>

<i>On top of the world</i>

<i>Nothing's gonna break me</i>

<i>Gonna get it right</i>

<i>Even if it takes me
doing it a thousand times</i>

<i>Trying once is easy</i>

<i>Discipline is hard</i>

<i>But nothing can defeat me</i>

<i>If the change is in my heart</i>

<i>This is my chance to break
free This is my chance</i>

<i>Everything's depending on me
On me</i>

<i>And if I keep trying I'll be
I'll be</i>

<i>On top of the world</i>

<i>Where I can see
everything before me</i>

<i>Stretching out my wings to fly</i>

<i>On top of the world</i>

I need two rows. Ladies on the
pink line, gentlemen on the blue.

<i>Welcome, everyone,
to our joint dance class</i>

with Prince
Charming Academy.

If we could keep the
shrieking to a minimum,

it would be much
appreciated.

<i>Hmm, it looks like
we'll have one extra lady.</i>

<i>Delancy, that's
the pink line.</i>

<i>I just don't see
Prince Nicholas.</i>

<i>He's the one I
want to dance with.</i>

<i>Maybe he's invisible.</i>

No daughter of mine sits
on the sidelines at a dance.

But, Mother...

<i>Looks like you're going to have
to sit out this one, dear. Pity.</i>

<i>All right, everyone's
paired up! Let's begin!</i>

Ugh.

Okay, come along.
Gentlemen, please bow.

Ladies, will you curtsey.

<i>Sorry I'm late...</i>

<i>Oh, no! I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>It's okay.</i>

<i>No, it's not.
I feel awful. Please.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Whoa.</i>

<i>Sorry. I didn't
mean to be late.</i>

<i>That's fine. The two of you can
partner up and join the dance.</i>

<i>Now, gentlemen, lightly kiss
the top of your partner's hand...</i>

And dance.

Milady, I am Nicholas,
young swain from the east,

most privileged to
make your acquaintance.

Think that was
polite enough?

Absolutely.

Think you can top it?

I, kind swain, am Blair,
maiden of Gardania,

honored above all to be
welcomed into your swaininess.

<i>Well done.
I try.</i>

<i>Wonderful, everyone!</i>

<i>Wonderful, now a final bow
and curtsey to your partners,</i>

and we say our farewells
to the young gentlemen

of Prince
Charming Academy.

Keeping in mind that
you will see them again

at the Coronation Day ceremony
at the end of the school year.

I shall count the
moments till then.

As will I, good sir.

<i>I have an
exciting announcement.</i>

Thanks to the generosity
of Dame Devin,

dinner tonight will be a chance for
you to get a taste of your future.

Our manners class
served in the palace.

Yes! Sweet!
No way!

The palace! Can you
even imagine it?

I grew up in the palace,
Portia. I live there.

Oh.

But can you imagine it?

<i>To prepare for this event,
you'll all have the afternoon</i>

to pamper yourselves
in the spa.

Your princess assistants

will help you take advantage
of all the amenities.

<i>Enjoy.</i>

<i>Wickellia.</i>

<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>Top thing you've always
wanted to see in the palace</i>

<i>that you can't
wait to see.</i>

Blair, go.

<i>Hmm, I've never thought
about the palace,</i>

<i>but Emily would
go nuts for it.</i>

I want to remember everything
so I can tell her.

Manicure time!

Nice. Isla, go.

<i>I'd love to find out more
about what happened</i>

to Queen Isabella
and her family.

<i>They're so mysterious.</i>

<i>So true. I want to find out more
about Gardania's magical crown.</i>

Isla mentioned that before.

<i>Emily would
love that story.</i>

Oh! Tell her the legend.

<i>It's said that the crown glows when
placed on the true heir of Gardania.</i>

<i>It lit up on Queen Isabella's
head at her coronation,</i>

<i>but it hasn't been
seen since then.</i>

All done!

These are beautiful.

<i>Thanks.</i>

<i>We should go.</i>

The earlier we get to the
palace, the more we can see.

<i>Our uniforms.</i>

<i>Every one is in shreds!</i>

<i>What are we going to do?</i>

<i>We're not allowed in class
without our uniforms.</i>

And if we skip a class,
we get an F.

<i>We can't fail!</i>

Coronation Day
is two days away!

How could this happen?

Seriously? It was Delancy. It had to be.

<i>She's the queen of
"Make Blair Feel Inferior. "</i>

<i>No. She's not.</i>

No one can make you
feel inferior.

Not without your consent.

<i>We're princesses, right?</i>

<i>We don't even have
our crowns yet.</i>

And you...

<i>I'm not talking about crowns.
I'm talking about character.</i>

The rule is we have to show
up to class in uniform, right?

<i>Currently they're
a little too breezy.</i>

Hmm. They just need
a little alteration.

Grace! Caprice! Harmony!

<i>Won't that
make them breezier?</i>

Hmm. It seems Blair, Hadley,
and Isla are running late.

<i>I do hope they're
not skipping class.</i>

<i>I'd hate to fail anyone
so close to Coronation Day.</i>

<i>Well, time's up.</i>

Oh, come now,
Dame Devin.

I think we can wait
a few minutes more.

And keep the
other students waiting?

That hardly seems fair.

<i>I'm afraid we'll have to
fail all three of them.</i>

<i>Wait!</i>

<i>What do you think
you're wearing?</i>

<i>Those aren't school-issued
uniforms.</i>

Forgive me, madam,
but they are, in fact,

made entirely from the material
in our original uniforms.

<i>But that's against the rules.</i>

<i>Actually, Dame Devin, there is nothing in
the dress code against what they've done.</i>

<i>Right. We just used some hard work
to unlock our princess potential.</i>

<i>And beautifully, at that.</i>

Come, join the class.

<i>Awesome!</i>

<i>Where did you get
new uniforms?</i>

Those are amazing!

<i>We made them.</i>

Blair made them.

How did you do that?

I want one.

<i>I didn't know
people made clothes.</i>

I thought they came from
elves. You know, like toast.

<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

<i>Welcome to the royal
palace of Gardania.</i>

As a special treat you will
have some time before the meal

to explore the first
floor of the palace.

<i>Enjoy!</i>

<i>Sweet. Royal secrets,
here we come!</i>

No way.

<i>Blair. It's a
picture of Blair.</i>

<i>That's not possible.</i>

<i>Why would there be
a portrait of me?</i>

<i>"Princess Isabella, age 18."</i>

That dog.

<i>It couldn't be!</i>

<i>"Queen Isabella,
King Reginald,</i>

<i>"the Princess Sophia,
and their loyal dog,</i>

<i>"Prince. "</i>

No way!

Blair? Do you know when your
mom found you on her doorstep?

The date? Sure.

<i>I mean, she made it my birthday
since she didn't know my real one.</i>

April 26th.

<i>What?</i>

<i>Blair, you know what
April 26th is, don't you?</i>

<i>Um, yeah.</i>

My birthday.
I just said that.

<i>It's the day the royal
family died in that car crash.</i>

<i>I'm thinking maybe baby Sophia
didn't die in that crash.</i>

<i>Maybe she was found and
left on someone's doorstep.</i>

No!

Yes, look at the portrait.

You look exactly
like Queen Isabella!

You could be
baby Sophia.

<i>If it's true, and Dame Devin
and Delancy know it,</i>

<i>that would explain why
they're so awful to you,</i>

<i>because you're the rightful heir
to the throne, and not Delancy!</i>

Okay.

<i>That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.</i>

<i>Dinner time!
We've gotta go.</i>

<i>This is serious,
you know.</i>

The whole fate of
Gardania is at stake.

<i>Come on, you guys.
It's crazy.</i>

<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

<i>Excuse me!</i>

<i>My daughter has a declaration about how she'll
handle things when she's crowned princess</i>

in two days.

Delancy!

Huh?

I, um...

Uh...

I...

<i>My brilliant daughter noticed
that Gardania's poorer sections</i>

are a blight to the otherwise
beautiful community.

Hey!

To remedy this she will
take over those areas,

bulldoze the buildings, and turn the
land into beautiful rolling parks,

full of trees and grass,
and streams.

<i>Wonderful for the environment.</i>

But people live in those
areas you just knocked down.

My neighborhood is there.

It is?

Delancy is
aware of that.

Those people will
move elsewhere.

<i>How? They're like me.</i>

<i>They don't have money. They
can't just pick up and move.</i>

<i>If I were you I'd leave
this school immediately</i>

and get my family
ready to move.

Delancy?

I think it is disgraceful.

Duly noted.

Now, shall we continue
our lesson in dinner manners?

<i>Right, then, students,</i>

we will start
with our salads.

Outermost forks.
You may begin.

<i>Let's go.</i>

Blair, are you okay?

<i>I'm better than okay.</i>

<i>I'm ready.</i>

<i>Ready for what?</i>

To fight.

<i>If Delancy gets on the throne
she's going to ruin my family,</i>

and probably this
kingdom along with it.

If she gets on the throne?

<i>She can't, if we can prove
someone else is the rightful heir.</i>

<i>Gardania's magical crown.</i>

<i>It must be
in the palace. Right?</i>

The crown glows when placed
on the true heir of Gardania.

<i>But we have to find it
before Delancy's coronation.</i>

So we have to find
the crown...

Tonight.

<i>It's time.</i>

Do we have
everything we need?

Game on.

<i>What's that?</i>

<i>What's going on?</i>

<i>Fire drill! Fire drill!
There's no time!</i>

Single file!
In a line!

<i>Hmm. I don't see
a fire drill on the schedule.</i>

<i>What about the plan?</i>

<i>We wait a little longer.</i>

Hopefully,
this will be fast.

<i>Lovely day for a surprise
fire drill, isn't it, darling?</i>

Mom, what did you do?

<i>Oh! What have you
done to your uniform?</i>

I like it, Mother.

Ugh! Come on.

<i>Let's join
the others outside.</i>

<i>Attention, students! You
may now return to your rooms!</i>

How much time
did we lose?

Thirty minutes.

Plus another 15 minutes trying to
untangle Portia from the tether ball pole.

<i>Let's go.</i>

<i>Thieves! They're thieves,
I tell you.</i>

Huh?

Arrest them.

<i>What?</i>

<i>I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake,</i>

but Dame Devin believes
you stole her jewelry.

No! I would never!

Not to save your poor family
about to lose their home?

I doubt that.

Plus my daughter,
Delancy, saw you.

<i>Didn't you tell me you saw Blair poking
around in my office the other day?</i>

<i>I don't...</i>

<i>I don't remember exactly,
but...</i>

Yes. Yes, I did.

I demand you
search their room.

<i>What?</i>

<i>Girls, it's procedure.</i>

<i>If you have nothing
to hide, it shouldn't matter.</i>

Look what I found.

My jewelry!

<i>That's not...</i>

<i>I didn't put that there.</i>

<i>Here's another.</i>

No way!

One more.

<i>We didn't steal anything.</i>

<i>Don't lie. It's unbecoming.</i>

Lock them up.

Headmistress Privet,
I promise you.

<i>With the evidence
and the witness</i>

<i>I'm afraid I have
no choice.</i>

Brock, take them
to the detaining room.

No!

<i>We can't investigate until
after the ceremony tomorrow.</i>

You will remain
detained until that time.

Detained?

As in, locked up?

During the coronation?

<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

Unless there is another
way to explain this.

Hmm.

How very disappointing.

<i>I'll say.</i>

Brock!

Isla, Hadley,

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

Now neither of you
will become princesses.

<i>Don't sweat it.</i>

<i>Who needs a tiara anyway?</i>

They just make
your head itch.

<i>And it's not easy to kick
a ball in four-inch heels.</i>

<i>Brock, stop!</i>

<i>I've got something else
in mind for the prisoners.</i>

You may turn them
over to me.

But my orders...

<i>Will officially come from me
in only a few hours.</i>

The keys?

<i>They're all yours.</i>

Thank you. You may go.

<i>If this is your way or rubbing
it in, you don't have to.</i>

<i>You've won.</i>

Yeah, we get it.

<i>What are you...</i>

<i>I'm supposed to be asleep.</i>

Tell me,

are you really
Princess Sophia?

<i>I... I don't know for sure.</i>

But I think so.

I think so, too.

This is a map
of the palace basement.

<i>There's something
of yours inside the vault.</i>

<i>Gardania's magical crown?</i>

<i>You have to get it.</i>

Let everyone know
the truth before coronation.

<i>Once I'm crowned,
it's too late.</i>

<i>Gardania's mine for life.</i>

<i>You don't want that?</i>

<i>I want what's right.</i>

I have to get back. My
mother will be looking for me.

Thank you.

<i>I'll leave a window open
for you on the third floor.</i>

Good luck.

Hey, Prince.

<i>Aw, don't look
at me like that.</i>

<i>I can't play
fetch, I'm on duty.</i>

Hey!

Prince. Prince. No, no.
Prince, come here. I gotta work.

Prince. Prince. Come on.

Come here.

<i>That's the window.</i>

<i>Let's hope Delancy did
what she said she would.</i>

<i>You're sure this will work?</i>

<i>Positive! Just hold on tight
and don't look down.</i>

<i>Come.
Come on. Come on.</i>

Come on.

Prince, hey.

Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

Come back here!

The elevator should be
right down this hall.

<i>It's time for
you to be asleep, Delancy.</i>

<i>You've a big day tomorrow.</i>

<i>Don't move.</i>

<i>What now?</i>

<i>Laser alarm.
We've got 'em at home.</i>

If we break the beams,
alarms go off.

<i>I can't see any beams.</i>

Perhaps a little
touch up will help.

<i>Nice.</i>

So, how good
are you guys at gymnastics?

I do a mean tree pose.

I think I can
do a somersault.

Follow me.

<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>No!
This way.</i>

Careful!

Huh?
Okay.

<i>No, no. Whoa!</i>

<i>Welcome, Dame Devin.
Your security is our priority.</i>

<i>Please enter your password.</i>

Password?

<i>Try something.
What would Dame Devin choose?</i>

<i>Delancy's coronation day?</i>

<i>Today's date.</i>

<i>You seem
to be having trouble.</i>

<i>Would you like your
password hint?</i>

Yes.

<i>Your hint is,</i>

<i>"The day it all
fell into place. "</i>

<i>Ten seconds
until your lockdown.</i>

<i>The day it all fell into
place? Nine, eight...</i>

<i>What does that mean?
... seven, six...</i>

<i>Wait. "The day it
all fell into place. "</i>

<i>The day Dame Devin's
plans started working.</i>

The day of the car crash.

<i>Thank you, Dame Devin.</i>

<i>Enjoy.</i>

Not in here!

Hadley, Isla, look!

<i>Gardania's magical crown!</i>

How do we get it
out of the case?

<i>You won't.</i>

<i>But I shouldn't have
too much trouble with it.</i>

<i>Goodbye, Blair.</i>

<i>Enjoy Coronation Day.</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>That's it.
We're sunk.</i>

<i>Well, Phil, here it is.</i>

<i>The day we've all
been waiting for!</i>

<i>My birthday?</i>

<i>No,
it's Coronation Day.</i>

<i>Even now, our beloved
princesses-in-training</i>

<i>are pulling into the royal palace
to receive their royal crowns</i>

<i>on their royal heads.</i>

Ladies and gentlemen!

I welcome you to
our annual Graduation

and Coronation Day...
This will be the best

<i>Coronation Day ever,
don't you think?</i>

Grace, go find Miss Privet
and tell her where we are.

Now, what are we
going to do?

You are hereby dubbed

<i>Lady Royal Josette
of Zinnia.</i>

You are hereby dubbed

Princess Miranda

of Philadelphia.

You are hereby dubbed

Princess Portia
of Narcissia.

Ugh! There is no service
at all down here.

<i>Hmm. What's this?</i>

Stand back!

If only there was a
keypad inside the vault.

Maybe there is!

Standing before me now

is Delancy Devin,

who will now
govern our beloved

and flourishing
country, Gardania.

Delancy, I now crown you

<i>Princess of...
Wait!</i>

<i>Uh... Proper
princess protocol!</i>

The bylaws state that before
a new princess can be crowned,

the entire assembly must
spin around seven times,

in honor of the seven
hills of Gardania.

<i>What is she doing?</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>What are you doing?
You need to be crowned!</i>

<i>I just... Uh...
Want to do it properly.</i>

Spin, you say?

<i>It is indeed
proper protocol.</i>

In honor of the seven
hills of Gardania,

let us rise and spin
around seven times!

<i>I got it!</i>

<i>The phone's linked up
with the keypad.</i>

Day of the car crash.

Ugh! Dame Devin must
have changed the code.

<i>You're right!</i>

I heard Dame Devin change it
when the doors were closing.

I heard it too!

<i>That's what I've been
humming this whole time.</i>

Let me see the phone.

Do, re, mi...

Ah! I got it!

<i>Woo!
Yes!</i>

<i>We did it!</i>

Now, hop on one foot

to honor those who
have hopped before us.

Bless you.

<i>Hey! What are
you doing here?</i>

And now everyone must pat his head
and rub his stomach at the same time.

<i>Enough!</i>

The protocols have been
satisfied! Crown her!

<i>Wait!</i>

No! Do not wait!

I am making a claim
to the throne,

because I am
Princess Sophia,

daughter of
Queen Isabella!

You know, there
is a resemblance.

This is ridiculous!

The princess died
17 years ago.

Finish the coronation

and make Princess Delancy
ruler of Gardania for life!

Dame Devin, this is a serious
claim and we have to...

<i>We have to crown
my daughter.</i>

Come on!

Oh! Get away!

Hah!

It is Princess Sophia!

You useless child!

<i>Do you have any idea
what you've done?</i>

<i>I eliminated Queen Isabella so
you could be princess one day.</i>

<i>No, that's not what I meant.</i>

Guards, please
take her away.

<i>No! You can't
do this to me!</i>

Get your hands off me!

You have to crown Delancy!

You have to!

<i>You'll pay for this!</i>

Blair... That is,
Princess Sophia,

is there anything you would
like to say to your new subjects?

Hello.

<i>I'm just a regular girl.</i>

But I think Headmistress
Privet is right

when she says every girl
has princess potential.

It is an honor
to be your princess.

Blair, this is when
the Princess of Gardania

chooses her lady royal.

<i>Now, I know it's
an important decision,</i>

so if you need
more time, then...

I already know
who I want.

It would be
an incredible privilege

if my lady royal
could be

Delancy.

But Blair, why me?

I was horrible to you.

<i>I wouldn't be wearing this
crown without your help.</i>

<i>Will you accept?</i>

I would be honored,
Your Highness.

<i>Lady Royal Delancy</i>

of Gardania.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>royals of all ages,</i>

<i>and dogs,</i>

<i>it's time to party!</i>

<i>Here's a special track
I wrote myself.</i>

Hope you like it!

<i>All of us</i>

<i>Fabulous</i>

<i>Put your hands in the air
All of us</i>

<i>We rule, we rule this school</i>

<i>We rule it
We rule it</i>

<i>All of us</i>

<i>Fabulous</i>

<i>And this is how we do it...</i>

<i>No way! You're
spinning your tunes?</i>

It was totally time.

I love it!

Hey, Blair,

<i>don't look now,
but look now.</i>

Congratulations,
Princess... Um...

You can call me Blair.

Congratulations
on your coronation, too,

Prince Nicholas.

<i>Wouldst thou do me
the honor of a dance?</i>

I would be
most delighted.

<i>Jump up, hands in the air</i>

<i>Crowns on our head,
lighter than air</i>

<i>Come on, now,
spin to the left</i>

<i>Spin to the right,
we're graduating</i>

<i>And it's our night</i>

<i>We rule this school</i>

<i>We rule this school</i>

<i>It's friendship
that makes us strong</i>

<i>And we all belong</i>

<i>Yeah, we all belong</i>

<i>We rule this school</i>

Your Highness? There are some
important people here to see you.

<i>Emily! Mom!</i>

Blair!

Oh!

<i>Welcome to our new home!</i>

<i>Really? We get to live in the palace?</i>

<i>We do.</i>

Oh, Blair.

<i>I know it's not exactly the
place we dreamed about...</i>

Are you kidding?

<i>It's better than anything
we ever dreamed about!</i>

It is, now that
the two of you are here.

Blair?

<i>If you're
a princess now,</i>

<i>does that mean
I'm a princess, too?</i>

Of course.

There is a princess
in every girl.

Come on. I wanna
introduce you to everyone!

<i>Jump up, hands in the air</i>

<i>Crowns on our head,
lighter than air</i>
