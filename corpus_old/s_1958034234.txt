[dramatic music]

Hey, Cal, any reception?

Nope, surprise, surprise.

Don't worry, once we
get rid of this place,

we'll get an apartment
with all the cell service

your heart can dream of.

I like it out here.

[soft eerie music]

<i>â™ª Come by my side â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You know I gotta have ya â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

[solemn music]

What are you doing?
That's Dad's.

Well, it's not like
he needs it anymore.

Look, Cal, I'm not
trying to forget Dad.

I promise I'm not.

I just, I don't need to be
reminded of him everywhere I go.

Well, I do.

[soft eerie music]

[soft suspenseful music]

What happened, Dad?

It's pretty neat, huh? I matter.

Oh, my God, Dad, no, they
actually call you that?

Yeah, and I pity the fool

who doesn't turn in
that physics homework.


That is so wrong.

Hey, well, in some world
there's bound to be

a version of me with a mohawk,

muscles and a million dollars.

You know, the only thing
that I wouldn't change?

What's that?

Here, that's us.

Yeah, the strongest shape in
the universe has three sides.

I love you, Cal.

I love you too, Dad.

[solemn music]

[phone buzzing]

Hey, Aunt Meg.

<i>to call all day.</i>

<i>How you feeling, being there?</i>

<i>-And don't say fine.</i>
-I'm fine.

<i>she coping okay?</i>

Mom, but, yeah.

<i>still wants to sell.</i>

sometimes it feels

like she wants to forget him.


<i>always needing the world</i>
<i>to revolve around her.</i>

<i>I'm just sorry it's you</i>
<i>having to deal with that.</i>

[phone static
drown out dialogue]

[eerie music]

<i>-Cal?</i>
-No, ah,

it's just a bad line.

There's so much to do,
I love you so much.

I have to go, okay, bye.

[soft suspenseful music]

-[Rae shrieks]
-[glass clatters]

Mom, Mom!

[tense dramatic music]

Hi, I'm, I'm fine, I'm fine.

It's just a stupid
spider, I'm fine.

Can you get some wood please?

It's gonna be cold tonight.

Sure.

[door thuds]

-[birds chirping]
-[solemn music]

[soft dramatic music]

[Rae crying]

It's okay, it's okay.

We'll get through it together,
like we always do, okay?

It's okay.

-[Rae crying]
-[water splashing]

Here you go.

I wanna keep Dad's research.

Is that okay?

I'll store it in my room,
you won't even see it.


You know that, right?

I know things have been
messy, but I'm used to messy.

I can handle messy.
We'll be okay.

I'm a way better mom
than I am a cook.

[dramatic apprehensive music]

[door rattles]

Hey, you're up early.

It's kind of hard to
sleep with a gong,

in case you wondered.

Oh, touchÃ©, lose
the gong, got it.

What, did you go for a hike?

No, I, um, I thought I heard,

I saw something outside
and I, there was nothing.

Ah, I'm going into town.

Do you wanna come,
we can get tacos?

I'm gonna get some reading
done, I'll see you.

Oh, come on, Cal, you
sound like your dad.

He, he, he got, you
know what I mean.

He just got obsessed
in the end, that's all.

I'll bring lunch back.

Love you.

[door thuds]

[solemn music]

[Cal sighs]

[gentle tense music]

Hm, red wallpaper.

you asked what Callie wanted.

Is that so bad?

Don't do that.
What choice do I have, Meghan?

-We need the money.
-[Meg] Then why not just

let Callie come stay
with me for a while?

Or I can sell the only
asset Lewis left us

and stay with my
daughter, how about that?


Honestly, I think a break
would be good for her.

Yeah, I'm sure you do.
I have to go.


[tense suspenseful music]

Reek?

[tense suspenseful
music continues]

[soft eerie music]

[Cal gasps]

Are you sure you?

Hello?

right in front.

[soft eerie music continues]

supposed to know what it is?

You're the scientist, babe,
I sure as hell don't.

I saw it again.

Daddy?

Mom?

What's happening?

The air was shimmering
and I saw that thing.

The monster.

[knuckles banging]

[Cal sniffling]

What do you think?

I thought you could
wear it to homecoming.

You okay?

You wanna talk?

I'm sorry,
Aunt Meg, it's beautiful.

But there's no way she'll
sell this place by then.

I was thinking you can
always come stay with me.

There is no reason you should

have to leave everything behind.

We can get you back in school.

You can go to homecoming.

What do you say?

I can't, she needs me.

What about you?

What do you need?

I get it.

Don't do what he did.

Do not make her your life.

Before you say anything,
I just came to check in.

Jesus, Meg, for someone so fake,

you should be able
to lie better.

Fine.

I'm worried about her
out here with you.

-Is that better?
-Much.

At least now you're admitting
you're a two-faced patronized-

Mom!

Don't worry, Cal.

I love you.

You remember what I said, okay?

Callie, look, I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

Cal, but she goads me.

Well, she's the only one I
can talk to about him, so.

[soft dramatic music]

What did you find, Dad?

-[air whooshes]
-[veil creaking]

[suspenseful music]

[air whooshing]

[suspenseful music continues]

[Cal panting]

[Reek grunting]

It's not real.

It's not real.
It's not real.

[suspenseful music continues]

[tense eerie music]

[dramatic music]

connected to the scope?"

[wind chimes clinking]

[metal clattering]

[soft suspenseful music]

[machine whirring]

-[Cal shrieks]
-Jesus, Cal.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Motion lights.

Can't be too careful.

Mom, it's two in the morning.

Where did you get that?

Oh, I found it
with Dad's things.

Can I keep it?

Yeah, I mean, it's not his,

he's allergic to silver.

Hey, um, you can
talk to me about him.

Okay?

We just can't dwell.

Life is about moving
forward, not backward, yeah?

Hello?

Hello, can you hear?

Sorry, the reception's
really crappy.

[Doctor Adams] <i>I was saying,</i>

<i>hallucinations haven't</i>
<i>been associated</i>

<i>with this medication.</i>

<i>Why do you ask?</i>

<i>a blog post</i>

<i>and ah, this guy said</i>

that he was seeing
things after he took it.

[Doctor Adams] <i>Are you</i>
<i>hallucinating, Rae?</i>


No, I was just
double checking, um,

you know, covering all my bases.

You say to always
think twice, right?

[Doctor Adams] <i>Maybe you</i>
<i>should come in for a session</i>

<i>just to be safe.</i>

Hello?

<i>-Rae?</i>
-Hello.

-Can, can, can you hear.
<i>-Rae, can you hear me?</i>

[soft suspenseful music]

[Rae sighs]

[soft suspenseful
music continues]

[soft suspenseful
music continues]


Isn't really the way
to think of them.

Imagine this is every
world in existence.

It's not just...

one, right?

Mm-hmm.

Wrong.

-And.
-Wait.

So you really think
you can do that?

Like travel to them?

Me? Yeah.

I'd settle for
seeing, but, yeah.

Yeah, I think one
day we will, hm?

No, I'd be too scared.

You? No way.

Besides, what did Rumi say?

"The cave you fear to enter,
hides the treasure you seek."

Yeah, pretty cool.

<i>Keep-looking science,</i>
<i>it's pretty cool, right?</i>



-[Cal laughs]
-[Lewis chuckles]

[soft suspenseful music]

[dramatic music]

Okay, Rae, just breathe.

It's all on your imagination.


[soft eerie music]

[veil creaking]

Is there anything in this house?

[soft eerie music continues]

[soft eerie music continues]

[gong booming]

[metal banging]

[suspenseful music]

[veil creaking]

[Reek creaking]

in here, Callie.

[Reek growling]

-[Reek shrieking]
-[Rae exclaiming]

It's not real, it's not real.

It's not real.


I know you've been
using the scope,

but it's gonna get you killed.

[suspenseful music]

Won't you talk to me?

I'm trying to help
you find your dad.

He's still alive, Callie.

I think I know where.

[suspenseful music continues]

[Rae whimpering]


-[Lewis] You're home early.
-You making, making toys now.

Rae, this is none
of your business.

You understand me, Rae?

-Excuse me?
-I'm not playing with you.

Stay out of it. You hear me?

I'm sorry.

It's just stressful work.

-We okay, babe?
-No, babe, we're not okay.

Whatever's gotten into
you, it's getting real old.

I'm taking Callie
back to the city.

Enjoy your toys.

[Rae panting]

[dramatic music]

Callie, I'm a friend.

I live next door,

the blue house on the
other side of the ranch.

You can trust me.

You have an ax in your hand.

It's to protect
you from the Reek.

That's what we call it.

Have you seen it?

Yeah.

I've seen it.

You definitely
took the slide out?

If you didn't, we're not safe.

I'm Drew.

So how do you know
about this thing?

'Cause your dad taught me.

Well, the version of
your dad from my world.

We pushed here together.

He was from five.

Have you looked there yet?

[suspenseful music]

On the wheel,
have you looked there yet?

It's not good.
Everything there is dead.

You definitely pulled the slide?

[dramatic music]

Mom.

Hey, don't go back there.

Mom, what are you doing?

I'm burning your father's crap.

No, Mom, that's,
that's Dad's stuff.

Callie, stop it, it's done.

No, you have no
right to do this.

I'm not looking at
this obsession anymore.

It's sick.

You know what, you're sick, Mom.

Dad was right about all of it.

What is this?

This is what you've been doing?

Why you've been
hiding away? Reading?

Mom, don't.

I can't do this
anymore, I can't.

Cal, stop it.


Listen, we have
to move on, okay?

-This is how.
-Get away from me.

Cal.

[fire crackling]

[solemn music]

<i>there's bound to be</i>

<i> a version of me with a mohawk,</i>

<i> muscles and a million dollars.</i>

<i>You know, the only thing</i>
<i>that I wouldn't change?</i>


That's us.

[Cal sobbing]

Cal? Cal, can I come in?

I made dinner. Are you hungry?

[soft suspenseful music]

[soft suspenseful
music continues]

[knuckles rapping]

Drew.

[door creaking]

Drew.

Drew.

[soft suspenseful
music continues]

Drew?

Callie, what the
hell are you doing?

Are you running
away from home now?

That's where we're at?

No, I was looking for someone.

Just stop, stop.

Look, if you're mad, be mad.

Don't do this.

I'm sorry for before, okay?

Well, maybe I'm
sick of sorry, Mom.

Sick of spending my whole
life worried about you,

about how you feel, whether
you're gonna lose it or not,

while you just do what you want.

-That's not fair.
-No?

Well, first you sell the house.

His favorite place in
the whole wide world

and then you burn his work,

and the only thing that
could maybe bring him back.

Oh God, Cal.

Cal, I'm so sorry
that I hurt you,

but he's not coming back, okay.

I hate it as much as
you do, but he is gone.

He's gone, he's gone.

Maybe Aunt Meg was right.

Maybe I shouldn't live with you.

[suspenseful music]

[solemn music]

[suspenseful music]

[Cal exclaims]

Don't scream.

I even left my ax at home.

How?

I saw it in the fire.

Fire doesn't hurt it.
Nothing does.

So what you said in the
barn was true about my dad?

He's alive?

Yeah.

He's the only one who might
know how to destroy it.

It's why I wanna find him,

but I'll need your
help to do it.

What do you say?

This will be dangerous, Callie.

Callie, you need to know that.

I'm not scared.

Well, you should be.

The Reek killed
everyone I loved.

Including Lewis from my world.

I'm lucky to be alive.

[suspenseful music]

[Reek shrieking]


Lewis knew I was in danger.

So he lured the
Reek away from me.

[soft dramatic music]

Lewis!

<i>Lewis saved our</i>
<i>world from the Reek.</i>

<i>He sent it back through</i>
<i>the veil for now,</i>

so if the Reek gets through
your world will fall,

like mine did.

open the door.

You have to go.

Maybe we should tell
her, she could help us.

No, no, you clearly
don't know my mom.

-You have to go.
-Callie.

I'll meet you in the
barn in 20 minutes, okay?

Callie, open this door,

open this door, right now.

I heard, I heard
someone and you,

I heard a voice.

I was on the phone.

No, don't do that to me, Callie.

I heard two voices.

One was you.

The other one was a boy.

I heard it.

It was just me, Mom.

I'm sorry.

So which world do
we look at first?

We're not looking.

We're going, set it to four.

Going? I, I thought you
said it was dangerous.

Well, we can't bring him
back by looking, can we?

And the whole time you
look the veil stays open,

which lets the Reek in.

This way is safer.

Now point it at me.

So, so how does this
veil thing work anyway?

If the veil is opened too
many times, it collapses.

What happened to
not being scared.

I have questions.

Then I'll explain
when we get there.

Just take my hand.

If we're not touching
when you click,

then you'll just
push me through.

This way we both go, okay?

Just stay by me.

We need each other now.

Fine.

But you stay by me.

[dramatic music]

[soft suspenseful music]

[veil creaking]

pull it together.

[soft suspenseful
music continues]

it so foggy here?

make any sense.

You definitely pulled the slide?

Yes.

in world four, right?

Yes.

That can't be right.

It's just, it looks
like world five did

after the veil fell.

Well, it's a shame

I don't know what that is.

Think of it like a wall
between the worlds.

It's like the only barrier
that's keeping the Reek out.

So the way it works, the
scope tears the veil.

That's how you see or
move between places.

But do that too
much and it falls.

Like it did in my world.

And then what happens?

There's no barrier.

The Reek comes in
and everything dies.

family will be inside here?

Hopefully, let's find
out if we're too late.

[tense suspenseful music]

[tense suspenseful
music continues]

[tense suspenseful
music continues]

[Cal gasps]



she died in world five.

What is it? Is it Callie?

She's fine.

It's me, I'm sick.

Meghan, you need to take her.

[soft suspenseful music]

We have to go.

to look for my dad.

The veil's gone, there
won't be anything left here.

No, you don't know my dad.

He's smart, Drew,
he'll be hiding.

Where? Look at this place.

I'm sorry.

No, don't do that.

He may be here.

Okay, you don't know.

[floor creaks]

Callie, set the scope.

-[Reek growls]
-[Cal gasps]

[Reek shrieks]

Run!

[dramatic suspenseful music]

[door clicks]

[Cal screams]

[body thudding]

[Cal whimpering]

Help me, please, help me.

Help me, please.

Take my hand.

Come on, just take it.

Callie, take my hand.

-[Cal screams]
-Come on.

[tense dramatic music]

[Cal panting]

Where to next?

not here in world one

and we know he
wasn't in world four.

Drew, you don't
understand, he's smart.

He might be hiding.

And you don't understand.

Smart doesn't matter
against that thing.

It can be anywhere.

Okay, well, then,
then we go to two.

He might be there.

And so might the Reek.

-Then we go to five.
-He's not there.

Lewis told me that he was
gonna send him somewhere safe

just until we fix things.

What do you mean, he told you?

[tense ominous music]

Callie?
Cal?

<i>that one day the scope,</i>

<i>it just appeared</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

[tense ominous music continues]

[tense ominous music continues]

That's the thing that hurt you?

call it the Reek.

-[Drew] How did it find you?
-[Lewis] I don't know.

<i>I was just starting to</i>
<i>explore with the scope.</i>

-It's pretty neat, huh?
-[Cal] Oh, my God, Dad.


<i>Each world is so different.</i>

<i>Each version of me,</i>
<i>of Callie, the house.</i>

<i>Were so similar,</i>
<i>but so different.</i>

<i>You know, the only thing</i>
<i>that I wouldn't change?</i>

<i>I was so distracted,</i>

<i>I didn't realize the Reek</i>
<i>had come through the veil.</i>

<i>Not until it attacked me.</i>

[Reek growls]

Ah!

[knuckles rapping]


[Lewis groaning]

Lewis, open the door.


[knuckles rapping]



Is it from one of
the other worlds?

No, there's a space
between the worlds.

I think that's where it lives.

So there's more
than one of them.

I don't know.

The real question is,

what if there's other
things out there

just waiting to get in.

Now, you can't tell
anyone about this.

[dramatic music]

<i>he knew the risk,</i>

<i>he became obsessed with it.</i>

<i>I warned Lewis that using</i>
<i>the scope could be dangerous,</i>

<i>but he didn't stop</i>
<i>and world five fell.</i>

<i> We had to escape, and the only</i>
<i>person Lewis felt could help</i>

<i>was your dad here in world one.</i>

<i>He spiraled, Callie, his</i>
<i>research in quantum physics,</i>

<i>he knew he shouldn't</i>
<i>jump through the barrier</i>

<i>between our worlds,</i>
<i>but he was desperate.</i>


It was Lewis, Lewis
from my world.

He used the scope too much.

He broke the veil, and the veil,

it's the only thing
protecting us.

So this thing, the stereoscope,

it breaks the barriers
between worlds?

Yeah, but we're
still not sure how.

I told him to stop,
but he wouldn't.

That's when the Reek came.

The Reek?

Yeah, that's what
we're calling it,

but we need to get him
to stop using the scope

or the veil will fall
and we'll all die.


<i>what Lewis was about to do.</i>

Lewis, I'm gonna send
you somewhere safe.

We'll come find you, I promise

-No!
-Lewis!

I had no choice, Drew.

Now, Callie and Rae
will be here soon.

It's just until I
fix this, I promise.

So that's how you
know he's alive?

Because you stood there

while he sent my dad
away to be killed.

Lewis said that your
dad would be safe

and he said that
we'd go get him.

Yeah, I saw how
safe that world was.

You know, if he's
dead, it's on you.

-I didn't.
-Stop.

I'll do it, I swear.

I'll send you back to five.

Stay the hell away from me.

Callie!

I know you don't like me.

I love that kid
more than anything.

You know why I believe that?

Because you called me.

Oh Jesus, Meghan, you won.

You can stop patronizing me.

I'll go get her.

Cal, I need to talk a second.

[knuckles rapping]

[suspenseful music]

Callie, Callie!

Rae, what is it?

Baby, oh, thank God.

Callie, whatever
happened, you're bleeding.

No, it doesn't matter.

It's Dad, he's alive.

He's not dead.

What, what are
you talking about?

He's alive in a different world

and I can prove it with this.

Okay, I'll prove it to you.

You gotta be careful
because when you put it in,

the Reek can come through.

No, no, no, no, no.

No, I must have
dropped it when I fell.

Cal, Cal, Cal.

I think it's time
we had a talk, okay?

Come on, let's go.

he could help us.

We should be out there looking.

-Dad is in danger.
-Callie, stop.

Do you hear how you sound?

Monsters, a boy
from another world?

Your arm looks terrible, Jesus.

-No, I'm fine.
-No, you are not.

And your mom and
I think it's time

that you come live with me.

No, no, no, I don't.

Callie, that thing you saw,

did it have horns
and those teeth?

You saw it too.

Do I need to remind
you why I'm here?

Your mom was hallucinating.

No, she's not.

Mom, I should have,
I should have told you.

Callie, you're
unwell and I am not

going to leave you
here with this woman.

Come on, okay?

-Now, let's go.
-Wait.

I'm not going anywhere
with you, Aunt Meg.

You should go.

Okay, but your father
wouldn't want you

to go through this.

I am doing this for you, Callie.

I'm sorry.

Mom, I should have asked.

I should have said something.

No, it's, it's okay.

Let's go find your dad.

What'd you say?

Cal, have you seen
the flashlights?

if I can find them.

[Reek growls]

[suspenseful music]

[Reek shrieks]

[metal clatters]

[suspenseful music continues]

Oh God.

-Sorry.
-Callie.

I found the flashlights.

this monster, what.

Callie.

I'm not the bad guy, I swear.

I don't care what you say.

I don't need you anymore.

No, you're gonna
have a hard time

jumping worlds without this.

Hey, Mrs. Thomas.

Is that what we needed, Cal?

If you're gonna go
up against the Reek,

you need all the
help you can get.


I messed up.

Just promise me that
once we find your dad,

we bury the scope, okay?

Here, take this.

We're not even, not yet.

Callie, can we trust this kid?

He came back, I mean,
he didn't have to.

He knows about this stuff.

We'll just keep an eye on him.

No, no, I'll keep an eye on him.

-You're staying here.
-What? No way.

Listen, if something
happened to you

I would never forgive myself.

Right back at you, Mom.

And besides, like Dad said,

the strongest shape in the
universe has three sides, right?

This will help.

Maybe try this instead.

What, we just show up?

Say we're from another world

and ask them if they've
seen my husband?

Pretty much.

And either we find him
or a version of him

that might know how to help.

A version of him, oh God.

Come on, Mom, you can do this.

Ready?

We have to touch.

I'm not being creepy.

Fine.

And Drew, if anything
happens to her,

I'll kill you myself.

Yes, ma'am.

All right Callie,
set it for world two.

All right, ready?

[eerie music]


Yeah, that's how it
looked where I lived

just before it fell.

Is that bad?

It just means we don't
have time to waste.


[dramatic music]

[Drew groaning]

[Drew panting]

[soft suspenseful music]

[Lewis yelling]


Who the hell are you?

Dad?

-Lewis.
-Dad.

Is that really you?

Cal?

What's going on here?

gonna need your help.

[suspenseful music]

It gets less weird, trust me.

This is really real, isn't it?

And as real as the thing
that's been hunting us,
thanks to you, it seems.

Well, I'm sorry, we didn't know.

trying to find her father.

They didn't know
that using the scope

would let that thing
in here, so sorry.

That's okay, I'm sorry

we haven't seen your husband.
He's not here.

Well, then maybe you
guys can all come with us

and we can go look together.

I have a better idea.

I've got something
that might help.

Y'all sit tight, I'll go get it.

What do you mean you can help?

It's fine, I'm
taking care of it.

I just think that they didn't
know what's happening to us.

Maybe, now they planning

on using that thing
even more, hm?

No, not if I can help it.

So how do you think
you're gonna go find him?

Well, we go look?

I mean, unless your
dad can help us.

No, no, no, no, no.

Give me the device
or I'll take it.

I'm not gonna let my family die

so yours can live, no, sorry.

Give it to me.

Slide it across the floor.

-I said give it to me.
-Don't you hurt her.

And move again and
I'll pull this trigger.

Give it to me.

Slide it across the floor.

And move, move.

Lewis, stop, don't do this.

Dad, how could you do that?

We stay, we die, Cal.

Now, how's this thing work?

Lewis, please, you don't
wanna do that, Lewis.

-Wait.
-Wait, wait.

-Stop, stop.
-Stop.

[eerie music]


-[Reek grunts]
-[all screaming]

-Rae!
-[Reek growls]

-[Lewis groaning]
-[all screaming]

The scope, get the scope.

[Reek grunting]

[eerie music]

[veil creaking]

falling. Go now!

-No!
-Ah!

[Reek grunting]

Callie!

[suspenseful music]

Are you okay? Are you hurt?

Mom, I killed them all.

But we're still okay.

We're still okay.

Where are we?

We're on world five.

This is where Drew was from.

But didn't he say that the
veil fell in his world?

Yeah, the Reek
could be anywhere.

[suspenseful music]

Mom, we have to go.

That's us.

Okay, the strongest
shape in the universe.

Lewis.

-Shh.
-Huh.

[wood creaking]

[wood banging]

It could be Dad.

I have an idea.

Just stay right here, okay?

[Reek groaning]

[suspenseful music]

[Reek shrieking]

Oh my God, get that door.

Callie.

Run, run, run.

-Mom.
-Run and hide.

-Come on.
-Go get out of here.

-No, come on.
-I love you,

I love you, now go, go.

Hide, you'll be safe.

[Reek banging]

[dramatic music]

Mom!

[Reek growling]

Mom...


[Reek growling]

-[Reek shrieks]
-Hey!

[rifle bangs]

[wind whooshing]

Rae?

[somber music]

Rae.

Dad?

-Are you okay?
-Dad!

it's really you.

What are you doing here?

How did you find me?

Callie figured it out.

Okay, we have to get outta here.

Okay, we're gonna go
inside and get the scope.

No, that thing is
in there, waiting.

We have to find a place to
hide and come up with a plan.

Come on, come on.

Hey, we only get
one shot at this.

Trust me, trust me.

Come on.

Without the stereoscope,
I was stuck.

But that thing can't kill
me if it can't find me.

[dramatic music]

Now, let's figure out how
to get us all outta here.

[solemn music]

I can't believe
you're both here.

You're telling me.

She kept pushing even
when I pushed back.

And that is great.

And she gets that from her mom.

I hate to say it, but...

Mom's been a mess without you.

Are you kidding me,
you saved my life.

You're a badass.

It's okay.

[solemn music]

It's okay.

Now from what I
could figure out,

there's a space between
the worlds, a dark plane.

This is where the Reek lives.

Okay, so if it likes
to dark so much

and bullets can't kill
it then maybe fire can.

No, nothing can, Cal,

blades, fire, nothing
hurts it, I've tried.

Which means we don't
try to kill it.

All right, we get
the stereoscope,

we get home and we never
use that thing again.

Now, we won't kill it, but it
won't be able to get to us.

Okay, that's fine with me.

We've got to get moving
before it gets dark again.

-Rae, Rae.
-[Rae gasps]

It's okay, it's okay.

It's time.

-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, yeah.

Okay, I'll distract the Reek,

you find the scope
and we meet back here,

but we've got to move fast.

As long as we stick to the
plan, we will make it, okay?

Let's go home.

[wind chimes clinking]

[rousing suspenseful music]

[Reek grunts]

-Dad!
-[Reek shrieks]

Hey! Hey!

Go girls!

we have to find the scope.


[suspenseful music]

Keep looking.

-[Reek shrieking]
-[Reek banging]

What, come on, where are you?

Oh, no.


Maybe it got moved.

-[Cal screams]
-What is it?


Cal! Cal.

[Reek groaning]

Do it now, do it now, Cal.


Go, Dad'll be waiting.

[knuckles rapping]

scaring me, let me in.


Oh God, not her.


Sorry, Cal, we just can't
deal with this right now.

-Then we go around her.
-[Meg] Let me in.

jump through world two.

[soft dramatic music]

[suspenseful music]

-Callie.
-Yeah?

Come on.

Run.

Let's go.

You ready?

[soft suspenseful music]

[door creaking]

There's my girls, oh.

-[Reek grunting]
-[Reek banging]

Do it, do it, Cal.

[Reek shrieks]

[phone line ringing]

<i>is your emergency?</i>

Hi, I need police dispatched
to me immediately.

My sister-in-law is mentally ill

and my niece is locked
inside her house

and I'm worried.

<i>calm down, ma'am, you're.</i>


Everyone okay?
Whoa, that's my girls.

See, I knew you would
never give up on me.

And I knew you would
figure it out, yes.

Meghan?

Lewis?

Meghan. [laughs]

Oh, my...

How?

[Lewis chuckling]

[eerie music]

Lewis, what is that?

it's starting to fall.

[veil creaking]

get in the car.


[Reek growls]

-Go!
-Oh God, come on, Meg,

-we gotta go, we gotta go.
-Okay.

-Meghan, keys?
-They're in my purse.

Well, where's that?

On the porch.

-I can make it.
-No.

Guys!

[eerie music]

[Reek grunting]

[air whooshing]

[car thudding]


Lewis, where did
it, where did it go?

Are we okay?

No, no, stay in the car, please.

-Please.
-[Reek shrieking]

-[all screaming]
-[glass crashing]

[Lewis yelling]

[dramatic music]


-[suspenseful dramatic music]
-[Reek growling]

[Reek shrieking]

[dramatic music]

[eerie music]

-Dad, are you okay?
-Yeah.


[solemn music]

[Rae, Lewis and Cal chattering]

get rid of some stuff here,

-'cause, I mean.
-It's pretty old.

-Oh, yeah.
-Cal said,

-you know.
-What is that?

Grandmama's Bat Man,
I don't know.

I don't know.

Well, since we are redecorating.

Oh wow.

-Blast from the past.
-Burn or box?

-Box.
-Burn.

Burn, it's awful.


Sorry, Cal, she is for the fire.
