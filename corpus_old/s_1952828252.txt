<i>Sometimes I blend in
like a book on a shelf</i>

<i>Sometimes I wear my jeans
like anyone else</i>

<i>There's millions of chameleons
blending in all around</i>

<i>Sometimes I wanna be found</i>

<i>'Cause there is
so much more to me</i>

<i>More than I could ever show</i>

<i>If you wanna fly with me</i>

<i>There is one thing
I got to know</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>A secret</i>

<i>Sometimes what you see
is not what you get</i>

<i>Sometimes you haven't
seen anything yet</i>

<i>I'm not the same melody
that everyone sings</i>

<i>Can't you tell
I'm hiding my wings?</i>

<i>'Cause there is
so much more to me</i>

<i>More than I could ever show</i>

<i>If you wanna fly with me</i>

<i>There is one thing
I got to know</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>A secret</i>

<i>Come with me and you'll see
a world beyond your dreams</i>

<i>More than it seems</i>

<i>Come with me and you'll see
that you can fly like me</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

Tracey Clinger here,

<i>at the premiere of
Barbie's latest movie,</i>

where top stylists Taylor
and Carrie are sharing

their secrets for
dressing a superstar.

Taylor? Carrie?

I can sum it up
in one word, Tracey.

Crystal!

Crystal?

<i>Look, it's Crystal.</i>

<i>Let's say hi.
It's been forever.</i>

<i>Carrie, I'm on camera.
Carrie!</i>

Wait.
What about the one word?

That one word is Raquelle.

Raquelle, hello.

<i>I'm here with Barbie's co-star,
the one and only Raquelle.</i>

Raquelle, we're so
thrilled you could make it.

<i>Oh, I wouldn't
miss it, Tracey.</i>

It gives me a chance to keep in
touch with all my adoring fans.

<i>Hey!
That's for Barbie.</i>


You know, Tracey, the best part
of this movie was working with...

Barbie!

I did not say, "Barbie".

<i>"A great script," is
what I was going to say.</i>

You can edit that together so
I come off looking good, right?

(CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY)

CROWD: (CHANTING) Barbie!
Barbie! Barbie! Barbie! Barbie!

Barbie!

Hi, Tracey.

That dress is
gorgeous on you.

Can you take a few steps
so we can see it in action?

Of course. Carrie
and Taylor are geniuses.


(CHUCKLES MALICIOUSLY)

I love it.

<i>It's so light,
so breezy.</i>

It just got
a lot breezier.

<i>Barbie, you promised you'd
come to me for a touch-up</i>

before you
go on camera.

We stylists are so demanding.
This way.

GIRL: Hey, Barbie! Hey, over here.

This is Tracey Clinger, live at
the Sunset. Back to you, Ryan.

<i>I can't believe Raquelle
purposely ripped my dress.</i>

No worries.

Good as new.

What?
What do you mean?

See for yourself.

Ta-da!

Oh, you two
are lifesavers.

But, how did you do that?

Uh, look.
Here comes Ken.

Hey, the premiere
is about to start.

Is everything okay?

<i>Everything's great.</i>

<i>I don't know how you did
it, but I totally owe you.</i>

<i>Lunch at Wally's
tomorrow?</i>

Sold like half-price
glitter-flats.

Now, go see your movie.

(CROWD CHEERING)

I saw that.

Crystal! Sit with us in the movie?

I have to go back.

Fashion pictures
for Princess Graciella.

Enjoy the movie.

Okay.
Great to see you.

Yes. You, too.

CROWD: (CHANTING) Barbie!
Barbie! Barbie! Barbie! Barbie!


So, what do you think?

<i>Crystal, it's just
a human movie premiere.</i>

Wait.

Who is that?

<i>He's beautiful.</i>

<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

Just someone at the premiere, I guess.

<i>I'm... I'm in love
with him.</i>

I must marry him.

Completely understandable,
Princess.

Consider him all yours.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

<i>Barbie, last night's
movie was incredible.</i>

You and comedy are like a
mini-skirt and knee-high boots.

Perfect together.

No.

You prefer ankle boots?

No. Brain freeze.

Ooh, bummer.

You are such a thief.

<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)


RAQUELLE: Hey, Barbie.

Fun time last night.

Great to see you
ripping things up.


<i>That's it.</i>

Where are you going?

To stick up for myself.

What she did last night
is so not okay,

<i>and I'm going
to call her on it.</i>

<i>Wow. Raquelle's been
sniping at Barbie for ages,</i>

<i>but Barbie's
never told her off.</i>

Is it bad that I totally want to watch?

Race you
to the door.

Raquelle!

We need to talk.

Really?
Whatever about?

<i>BARBIE: I can't believe you
purposely ripped my dress.</i>


<i>I can't believe you put
your dress under my shoe.</i>

You wanted me to look bad.

<i>You don't need me
for that.</i>

Raquelle,
this has to stop.

There he is, Princess.

You. You're perfect.

What? What? Hey!

We're going
to get married.

What?

Back to the palace.

Hey!

Ken!

Let me down.

Let him go.

<i>Crystal,
what's going on?</i>

Huh?
Huh?

<i>You heard her. A wedding.
Isn't that beautiful? Gotta fly.</i>

(KEN WHIMPERING)

Very high. (EXCLAIMS)

Hey! I can see
my house from here.



Princess Graciella,
stop!

GRACIELLA: Stay away.

You do not get to
spoil my wedding day.

TAYLOR: No!

She closed the portals.

The Fairy Phone.

No.

No.

Yes!

You... How...
You... You flew.

What are you?

<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

It must have been
a trick of the light.

<i>"A trick of the light"?</i>

You just busted out
wings and flew.

With four
other girls.

And they took
Ken with them.

How can that be
a trick of the light?

<i>Um, it can't. But that's
what the Fairy Handbook</i>

says we're supposed
to say if we're caught.

The Fairy Handbook?

<i>(SCOFFS) What's that?</i>

<i>It's a handbook
for fairies, and...</i>

<i>I mean... Taylor, this
isn't going very well.</i>

Too many apps.

Hey, hold on.

What do you mean,
Fairy Handbook?

Oh, wait,
I got a signal.

Nope, lost it.

Did I say, "Fairy"?
I meant Dairy Handbook.

Never can tell when
you'll need to make cheese.

Taylor,
little help here.

I've got three bars.
Everyone freeze.

Got it.

Carrie, forget it.

<i>We can't give them an
excuse after what they saw.</i>

<i>Barbie, Raquelle, it's time
you learned the Fairy Secret.</i>

Carrie and I are fairies.
So are those other girls.

Okay.

<i>You see us all the time.
You just don't realize it</i>

because we keep
our wings hidden.

We come from Gloss Angeles
and we're...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gloss Angeles?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

I so get this now.
We're being Prank'd.

Prank'd?

this up to promote our new movie.

Where are the cameras?
Can we do another take?

I'll give you way more
in another take.

<i>This isn't a stunt.
We're real fairies.</i>

<i>I'm a Shoe Fairy.
Carrie's a Purse Fairy.</i>

<i>And Ken's in real danger.</i>

What kind of danger?

Humans can
visit Gloss Angeles.

But Princess Graciella
said she was marrying Ken.

And if a human comes to Gloss
Angeles and marries a fairy,

that human has to stay
in Gloss Angeles forever.

Fairy law.

So, if you're real, then
Ken really is in trouble.

How do we save him?

<i>"We?"
Yeah, we.</i>

Ken is my friend, too.

How?

We go shopping.


Okay,
first couple picture.

Get together
and say, "Fairies. "

Fairies.

Love it.

Look, will you guys
let me go already?

As you wish, darling.



(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

Gentle with my fianc√©.

What? Whoa!

<i>Look, I don't know who you are or what
you are, but you've made a mistake.</i>

<i>I'm not
marrying anyone. I'm...</i>

Zane.

Huh?

You!

Hi, Zane.

You thief.

Oh! Oh!

You plan to steal my
love, Princess Graciella?

No.

<i>Yes. I'm going to marry...</i>

<i>What's your name, sweetie?</i>

Ken.

Kent.
Ken.

<i>He's the love of my life and
we're marrying at sundown.</i>

What?

So.

You think you're man enough
to marry my Graciella?

No. (CLEARS THROAT)
Wait, I mean...

<i>Sure, I'm man enough.</i>

<i>No. No, no. I don't
want to marry Graciella.</i>

<i>I'm in love
with someone else.</i>


Kevin! How could you say such a thing?

And on our wedding day.


<i>Oh, come on, don't cry.</i>

<i>It's Ken. And look,
I don't even know you.</i>

You dare besmirch the honor of the
loveliest flower in Gloss Angeles?

<i>No. There's no besmirching.
I would never besmirch.</i>

<i>I don't even know what that
means. Can one of you pinch me?</i>

<i>Because I'd really like to believe
I'm dreaming right now and...</i>

Ow!

I challenge you
to a duel.

<i>We will fight to see who's
more worthy of Graciella's love.</i>

<i>A duel for my hand.
That's so romantic.</i>

We'll have it
right before the wedding.

No. No, we won't.

<i>I don't want
to duel with you.</i>

<i>So, you think my love,
Graciella, isn't worthy of a duel.</i>

You insult me, sir.

<i>I'm sorry. Believe me,
it's not my intention to.</i>

And for that insult, I
challenge you to a duel.

Again?

So, you think I am not
bold enough for two duels?

And for that, I challenge
you to a third duel.

Oh, why not?

<i>I wasn't doing anything
after the second one anyway.</i>

Attendants, gather weapons
and help them prepare.

Oh.

Goodbye, my darling.
I'll see you at the duel.

(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) You're
leaving me here with him?

<i>Oh, don't worry.
He won't hurt you.</i>

Oh, okay, good.

Not until the duel.


And even if you get completely
pounded and pelted and pummeled,

I promise
I'll still marry you.

<i>So, there's really no
losing, is there, Glen?</i>


Wait. Graciella.

My nose. And on
my wedding day, too.

Oh, what am I saying?

Graciella!
Let me out of here.

(UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)

Raquelle, come on.

On my way.

Taylor and Carrie said just to
grab something so we blend in.

We're not actually
trying things on.

I know, but
these all look so cute.

I bet Ken would flip for me
in this purple one on top.

What do you think?

What?

May I help you?
Yes.

<i>We'd like your best
fitting room, please.</i>

Right this way.

You'll want this one.

<i>But this looks
like it's being used.</i>

<i>(LAUGHS) Doesn't it?</i>

<i>Haven't you noticed there's
one stall in every fitting room</i>

<i>that's always closed, even
though no one's ever in it?</i>

<i>Yes. (GASPS)
That's a fairy thing?</i>

Right. A Fairy Flyway.

So that means the
fitting room attendant is...

Yes. A fairy.

Can we go in already?

Like, before these
clothes go out of style?

<i>Let's do it.</i>

Whoa!

Okay, okay,
I got it.


Where are we?

<i>No, we can't be.
Is this Paris?</i>

top of the Eiffel Tower.

We are. We're in Paris.
But how?

The Flyway. Flyways are fairy
shortcuts to spots all over the globe.

RAQUELLE: Great.

Some reason you decide to take
us to a spot with no safety rail?

We had to
come to Paris.

<i>It's home to the one Gloss Angeles
door Graciella couldn't lock.</i>

The personal portal
of Lilliana Roxelle.

Lilliana Roxelle,
the famous fashion editor?

I know her.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Name dropper.

<i>I'm not dropping names.
I'm just saying I know her.</i>

She came to a fashion show
at my Aunt Millicent's.

<i>She's also the oldest and wisest
fairy living in the human world.</i>

Want to see her again?

Sure. But...

How are we going
to get down?

<i>The elevator doesn't
even go up this high.</i>

Who said anything
about an elevator?

No. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

No plane, no fly.

You'll love it. Honest.

<i>What if people see us?
I thought that wasn't okay.</i>

Fairy law, right?

<i>It's dark and
we're not flying far.</i>

No one will see us.

You're sure
you can do this?

<i>I'm a Shoe Fairy.</i>

The more fabulous my shoes,
the stronger my magic.

Check these babies.

RAQUELLE: Ooh!

If I had to trust my life to one
pair of shoes, it would be those.

They give me enough magic so we can
fly together when you hold my hand.

And my purse comes with flying
power and a matching belt.

Ready?

Oh.

Oh, no, wait.

(GIRLS SCREAMING)


Whew!

We're flying.
We're really flying.

Oh, and look.
How beautiful.

This is definitely
the way to see Paris.

Hold on.

(GIRLS SCREAMING)

(KEN SCREAMING)

Len, I heard
your horrible scream.

Did Zane start the
duel early and hurt you?

<i>No. Your attendants put me
in armor that's way too tight.</i>

<i>I don't suppose you have
a can opener handy, do you?</i>


TAYLOR: I know Lilliana
lives in this neighborhood.

That must be it.

Miss Roxelle?

<i>Ah! Enchant√©e...</i>

Barbie?

Hi, Miss Roxelle.
Hi, Miss Roxelle.

Ah. Fairies.

<i>Carrie and Taylor, oui?</i>

<i>Oui.
Oui.</i>

Ahem.

<i>I'm sorry,
do I know you?</i>

Apparently not.

Miss Roxelle,
we have a problem

and Carrie and Taylor thought
you might be able to help.

Perhaps I can. Come in.

<i>LILLIANA: So, Princess Graciella flew
off with Ken and said she'd marry him?</i>

And closed all the portals.
Except yours, of course.


And of course,
I'll let you use it.

But you might need
something more. Hmm.

<i>Did you notice the
color of Graciella's eyes?</i>

Yes. Violet.

The perfect match to a sweet
pair of boots I bought last week.

Violet? But Graciella has blue eyes.

Ah-ha! Then she has
taken the love potion!


A love potion?

The potion
adds a little red,

the color of love,
to the eyes.

<i>The red turns blue eyes purple
and that's how you can tell.</i>

Hmm. I used to dabble in
match-making, so I might still have...

<i>Oui. Not much left,
but enough for one dose.</i>

Here. Release this mist
directly above Graciella

so it can rain down on her.

<i>That will break
the potion's spell.</i>

Thank you.

<i>Let's go.</i>

Whoa!

Nice catch. I think you
two are good friends, yes?

You seem to
work well together.

BOTH: We do?

<i>Oui. You do.</i>

Now, come.
I'll take you to my portal.

<i>"Rodeo Drive, Fifth Avenue, Shanghai"?</i>

Are these all
Fairy Flyways?

To my favorite
shopping spots.

<i>For those times
when I just can't wait.</i>

I so know
that feeling.

You're not going
with them, are you?

I thought you were
banned from Gloss Angeles.

You know?
You are?

We are.

Why?

<i>It's a long story.
But we're going back anyway.</i>

But you face years in the
dungeons if you're caught.

Friends stick together,
especially when things are rough.

Exactly.

Barbie has always
helped us,

so we're going to
help her and Raquelle.

Is it still okay
if we use your portal?

But of course.

Going up?

Going up? But how?

<i>We're in the penthouse,
there's no such thing as up.</i>

<i>Like there's no
such thing as fairies?</i>

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

Take care, Lilliana.

Nice shoes.

See you soon.

We really appreciate it.

Bye, Lilliana. Thank you.

<i>Bonne chance. Be careful.</i>

Barbie, Raquelle,
welcome to Gloss Angeles.

<i>It's incredible.</i>

<i>I can't believe
it's real.</i>

<i>I can't believe
it's so high in the air.</i>

How far down
is the ground?

Ground?

Yeah, the ground.
I mean, if I fell,

<i>I wouldn't just keep
falling forever, right?</i>

<i>Sooner or later
I'd hit the...</i>

<i>Oh. There's no ground.</i>

<i>That's okay.</i>

We'll just hold onto Carrie
and Taylor, like before.

On a rescue mission?
Too risky.

<i>If there's trouble, you
might have to fly on your own.</i>

Yeah, see, no problem.
We'll just fly on our own.

<i>We can't fly on our own.</i>

Yet.

Oh, goody. We get to
go to Wings and Things.

<i>BOTH: (SINGING) When
humans need some fairy bling</i>

<i>Fly them down to
Wings and Things</i>

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!

<i>Okay, now I'm getting worried
about the no-ground thing.</i>

I know, right?

Wait until you experience
the airavator.

<i>The airavator? What's the...</i>

(GIRLS SCREAMING)

GIRLS: Whoa!

<i>Wasn't that fun?</i>

(NERVOUS LAUGH) Not sure. Maybe if I can
go back and get my stomach, I'll ask it.

<i>Come with me and you'll see
a world beyond your dreams</i>


<i>More than it seems</i>

<i>Come with me and you'll see
that you can fly like me</i>

Three half-caffs to go.

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

You want sparkles
with that?


Look,
Wings and Things.

Mmm. Hmm.

CARRIE: Hi, Reena.

Carrie! Taylor!


My favorite
fashion fairies.

had you banned.

Fairy law says I should call the
palace guards on you right now.

Will you?

Oh, of course not.

But be careful.

Princess Graciella
is a passion fairy.

<i>Her emotions are incredibly
powerful, especially when she's angry.</i>

Nothing is stronger.

Our love is stronger,
Reena.

never spoken.

So, how can I help you?

We need some wings
for our human friends.

<i>Hi, I'm Barbie.</i>

<i>I'm Raquelle.</i>

<i>Hi, I'm Reena.</i>

<i>That's my husband, Graylen.</i>

<i>I'm a human
like you girls,</i>

but I fell for him the minute
I arrived in Gloss Angeles.

<i>And didn't think twice
about staying here forever.</i>

<i>Forever? You really can't go
back once you've married a fairy?</i>

Never?
Nope, never.

But who needs it?

<i>When you're with the one
you truly love, that's home.</i>

<i>I bet Princess Graciella's
new husband feels the same way.</i>

New husband? You mean,
they're already married?

Oh, no, no, no,
not until sunset.


Oh! But you're not here to
gossip about fairy business,

you're here for wings.

And I have the perfect
pair for each of you.

Hmm. Mmm.

Mmm-hmm.

Oh, yes.

Oh.

Yes.

Well, tell me
you love them.

I do love them. Thank you.

They're incredible.
How do they work?

You just think about what you want
the wings to do, and they'll do it.



Whoa! (LAUGHS)


Whoo! Whoa!

Whoa!



(CHUCKLES EMBARRASSINGLY)
I meant to do that.

(FAIRIES CHUCKLING)

<i>It's getting close to sundown,
so I think we have to fly.</i>

Thank you, Reena. Goodbye.

Thanks, Reena.
Goodbye, Graylen.

Goodbye.

Goodbye.
Happy Royal Wedding Day.


Think you can try it
for real?

I'll do it
if you do it.

BOTH: On three.

One.
One.

Two.
Two.

Three.
Three.

Whoa!

Whoa!



Whoa!

We're rocking it,
Raquelle.

Whoa! Whoa!

No, you're rocking it,
Barbie.

Do you have to rub it in that you're
naturally brilliant at everything?

Whoa!

What? Raquelle, I...

So, now we have wings.
How do we find Ken?

Raquelle...

<i>What, don't you
want to find him?</i>

You know I do.

<i>I'm sure Graciella
took him to the palace.</i>

The highest point in
Gloss Angeles.

Whoa.
That is very high.

Oh!

Want to hold my hand to make it easier?

No, thanks.

If Barbie can do it,
I can do it.

Ripped from DVD by funnykiddy

Whoa!


BARBIE: We have to hurry,
the wedding is at sunset.

Ladies and gentlemen, the
Fairy Handbook requires a duel,

and I have paused my wedding
preparations to attend the first phase.

Trial By Fire.

<i>Fire? As in
"Hot Roasted Ken?"</i>

No, not real fire.

<i>It's a round of dueling
to prove our strength.</i>

<i>If one of us isn't strong enough
for a full duel, he'll be eliminated.</i>

Define "eliminated. "

<i>Don't worry, Trent.</i>

<i>Crystal's taking
lots of pictures</i>

so we'll know how to
rebuild you if we need to.


Duelists, stand before
me and face one another.

<i>Zane, you don't have
to duel for Graciella.</i>

<i>I'm sure there are all
kinds of other fairies</i>

who would love
to be your girlfriend.

Me, for example.

Stand back.

Deploy wings.





Really?

It was the only
clip-on pair we had.

Mmm.

Turn back to back
and in five paces,

you each do
your best magic spell.

Five.

<i>Magic spell? I don't
know any magic spells.</i>

Four. None?

Three.
No.

Two.

We'll do a wonderful job
rebuilding you, darling.

What?

One. Begin.

Okay, see my thumb?

<i>Now, look.
I'm pulling it off.</i>

Look at that.
Amazing, right?

<i>That's just
your other thumb.</i>

Is it? Is it or am I
really pulling off my thumb?

<i>No, it's your other thumb.</i>

You're bending one down and
folding your fingers over the other.

<i>But doesn't it
look a little magic?</i>

No, it doesn't.
This is madness.

How can you possibly want
this human more than me?

Forget the duel.

<i>Just call off the wedding and
let's go back to the way we were.</i>

<i>Yes! Listen to Zane.
He's a smart, smart man.</i>

Zane, deploy your magic.

(EXCLAIMS IN FEAR)

<i>Whoa! That's sparkly.</i>


Oh.


Hey!


Ah-ha!



That was incredible,
Dennis.

I must admit, after the wimpy
wings and your pathetic magic,

I almost
called off the duel,

but now you've shown you can handle it
as well as any fairy in Gloss Angeles.

Eh? What? No.
No, wait, I...

Go to your corners and prepare
for the second phase of the duel.


Whoa.

There it is. The palace.

Watch out.
Turbulence.

GIRLS: (SCREAMING) Whoa!

Whoa!

BOTH: Barbie! Raquelle!

Hey! Look what we found.

Or, what found us.


Oh! You found
the Pegaponies.

Amazing! They're known
for being extremely shy.

They only come out
around people they like.

<i>Really? Aw, thank you.
I'm honored.</i>

Me, too.


<i>I'm thinking maybe we
could ride to the palace.</i>

Yes. Can we?

<i>Ooh, I'd love it. Let's.</i>

That is, if any of you would be
willing to give Taylor and me a ride.


Ready?

<i>Let's do it.</i>


What happened?
Are you okay?

<i>They won't go any
further because of those.</i>

Swirlnados.

Incredibly treacherous wind
currents used to protect the palace.

Even the most expert
flyer will lose her balance

and fall if she
gets caught in one.

Graciella must've just activated
them to secure the wedding.

RAQUELLE: How do
fairies get past them?

<i>I don't know.</i>

Raquelle can do it.

BOTH: She can?

I can?

You can.

No one handles
horses like you.

<i>If anyone can lead us through
the swirlnados, it's you.</i>

<i>How do you know
I'm good with horses?</i>

Are you kidding?

We were in riding camp together
this summer after 10th grade.

You were incredible.

<i>I didn't think you
even noticed I was there.</i>

You put shaving cream
in my riding helmet.

Well, yeah, but,
I mean other than that.

You were the best rider
there. And horses trust you.


If you lead the way,
I know we can make it

to the palace
in time to save Ken.

But, if I mess up

and we get caught by
one of those swirlnados...

<i>I don't believe
that will happen.</i>

If you lead, I'll follow.

Me, too.

I will, too.

<i>(SIGHS) Okay. Let's do it.</i>

But stay close. I want your
three ponies right behind mine.


<i>Don't be scared. I promise you
we can get through safely.</i>

We just have to work
together. Okay, little guy?


Now!


We're almost through.


BARBIE:
You did it, Raquelle.

That was amazing.

Thanks. And thanks
for believing I could.

And thank you.


So, now we need to get into
the palace and find Ken.

Exactly. But first, we need
to get past the palace fairies.

We need a good disguise.

<i>I'm on it.</i>

No.

No.

<i>I hope you don't mind my
asking, but why were you banned?</i>

Yeah, I was wondering
that, too.

What did you do?

<i>Absolutely nothing.
We didn't do anything.</i>

Oh, come on. You must
have done something.

<i>If we did,
we don't know what it is.</i>

We used to be friends
with Princess Graciella,

then out of nowhere, she
proclaimed we betrayed her

and she banned us.

Which is fine.

<i>If that's the way she wants to
be, she can keep Gloss Angeles.</i>

Once we save Ken, we'll stay
in the human world for good.

How do we look?

Well...

Do you have any chef
outfits in your purse?

Oh.

Halt.

Are those fairy cakes?

Um, yes.

With butter
cream icing?

Yes.

Want one?
Mmm.

You may go.

Mmm. Mmm.

RAQUELLE: (SIGHS)
We made it.

So, where do you think
Princess Graciella would hide...

(KEN SCREAMING)

Ken!


(LAUGHING GLEEFULLY)

Bravo, my love.

May your agility be
passed on to our children.

Our what?




FAIRIES: Ooh.



Whoa. (SCREAMING)

What are you doing?

Come up here and
fight like a fairy.

<i>I'm not a fairy.</i>

Besides, have you seen
these wings?

No one could fly with
these wings.


Stop!

Interference. Come on.

Barbie! And you've got wings, too?

Who dares interrupt
my royal duel?

Barbie!
The antidote mist, now.

Freeze!


<i>I can't move.</i>


None of us can.

What did you do to them?


Barbie, are you okay?

<i>Don't touch her.</i>


<i>She's nothing to you.
You're marrying me, Kyle.</i>

<i>It's Ken.
You don't even know my name.</i>

Why would we get married?

<i>Because she's under
a love potion spell.</i>

What? (LAUGHS)
Have you lost your wings?

<i>Look in the mirror. Your eyes
aren't blue anymore, they're violet.</i>

<i>That's the sign of the potion.</i>

Graciella, you're under a love
potion. This all make sense.

<i>You don't realize
what you're doing.</i>

Let me help. Unfreeze me
and I'll remove the spell.

<i>Don't listen to her,
Graciella.</i>

She... She just wants
to steal your fianc√©.

Why are you
encouraging this?

Because Crystal
is in love with you.

<i>That's why she wants Graciella
to marry someone else.</i>

And why she gave
Graciella the love potion.

(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

Crystal, is that true?


Those shoes.
I know those shoes.

Princess Graciella, those
fairies are Taylor and Carrie.

I knew I should've
gone with the pumps.

Attendants!

It is you.

And you're still
trying to betray me.

This time
by ruining my wedding.

And spreading lies
about me.

No. Graciella.

Enough! You're liars.
You and your friends.

I banished you before,

but now you'll feel the
full force of my wrath.

Barbie! Raquelle! What
did you do to them?

I put them
in FurySpheres.

The walls are made of pure
anger, impervious to force.

<i>Mi amore.
You are going too far.</i>

What they're
saying is true.

Enough. Or I'll make a
FurySphere for you as well.

Are you okay?

We're fine.

Well, fine-ish.

Let them go.

I'll marry you if I have to,
just let them go.

You'll marry me either way.

Princess Graciella,

would you do me the
honor of being my bride?

<i>That wasn't me.
I didn't say that.</i>

But you did, my love.

And I will be your bride.
Right now.

The duel is off. Kirby and
I have a wedding to attend.

Wish you could join us,

but you have an
appointment in the dungeon.

Ken!

No! Barbie!


Shall we?

<i>Girls can be so fickle,
can't they?</i>

(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)


Think of it
this way, Zane.

Soon it will all be over

and you'll be free to heal
your heart with someone else.


Need to break
these chains of love.

There has to be
a way out of here.

Carrie, what do you
have in your purse?

Maybe this will give
Graciella something to chew on.

got her on the ropes.



Yes! I think this time
I've got a home run.

RAQUELLE: Enough!

It was going to be
a baseball bat, right?

Uh-huh.

Okay, go ahead
and give it a try.

<i>I think it's hopeless.</i>

No magic from
the fabulous shoes?

Not against
a FurySphere.

<i>Then it's over.</i>

<i>I can't believe we failed.</i>

No, you did everything you
possibly could. We all did.

<i>But it wasn't good enough.
Now, we're caught in a dungeon,</i>

and even if we do get out
one day, Ken will be married

and stuck in
Gloss Angeles forever.


Are you laughing?

<i>I'm sorry, it's just...
If you'd told me yesterday</i>

<i>that we'd be stuck in a tiny cage
together for who knows how long,</i>

<i>I'd have sworn we'd
have killed each other.</i>

<i>But, now, I'm not happy
we're stuck,</i>

<i>but the being with you part,
I actually don't mind it.</i>


<i>I'd have said
the same thing.</i>

But, now, if I have to be stuck
in a tiny cage with someone,

<i>I'm actually glad it's you.</i>

I mean that
in the good way.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Why has it always
been so bad between us?

I feel like from
the minute we met,

you've always
had it in for me.

<i>Are you kidding?
It's the total opposite.</i>

<i>The minute we met, you decided
I wasn't good enough for you.</i>

What?
Why would I do that?

Because you're
the queen of the school.

You're pretty, you're smart,

you're popular,
you're talented.

<i>I totally wanted to be your
friend, but you weren't interested.</i>

You never
said a word to me.

And you certainly never invited
me to eat lunch with you.

Invited you to
eat lunch with me?

Every time I smiled at you,
you glared and turned away.

<i>Yeah, because I knew you didn't like me.</i>

<i>I didn't even know you. You
wouldn't say two words to me.</i>

Because I was shy.

And maybe I was
a little insecure.

Maybe I am a little
insecure sometimes.

<i>So, maybe when I thought
you didn't like me</i>

<i>I started being mean to you so
I'd be the one doing the rejecting.</i>

Raquelle...

Remember I said "maybe. "

Then maybe I should have
tried harder to be your friend.

I really wanted to.

When you first came to school,
I was dying to get to know you.

You're kidding.

We were in acting class and you
seemed so confident and talented.

I thought it would be
great to be your friend.

But then you
were so distant.

And then mean.

<i>I figured
you just didn't like me.</i>

I definitely
should have tried harder.

You were the one in
a new place,

I should have been
the one to reach out.

<i>I'm sorry I never invited
you to sit with me at lunch.</i>

I should have.

Thanks.

<i>And I'm sorry I glared at
you and turned away so much.</i>

And acted mean.

Do you think
we can be friends?

I think we are friends.



Barbie! Raquelle!
Your wings.

Barbie, your wings,
they're incredible.

Yours, too.
They're amazing.

<i>But I don't understand.
What happened?</i>

Remember at Wings and Things?

<i>Graylen said
his and Reena's love</i>

<i>is stronger than
a Passion Fairy's anger.</i>

Your forgiveness is
stronger than her anger, too.

It transformed the
prison of a FurySphere

to the freedom of wings.
Real wings.

Real wings!

Forgiveness
lets you fly.

Raquelle! Now, we can
get to the wedding.

Yes!

<i>It's in the grand hall.
We're right underneath it.</i>

Just fly up and you'll be there. Hurry.

Do you, Ken,
take Princess Graciella

to be your lawfully wedded fairy wife?


I do.

(EXCLAIMS IN FRUSTRATION)

Then by the power vested in
me, I now pronounce you...

ZANE: I object.
(CONGREGATION EXCLAIMS)

<i>You already objected.
You can't object again.</i>

I can, and I will.

You're making
a terrible mistake.

Listen to your heart,
Graciella.

If you are under a
love potion, fight it.

Please, let the human go
and marry me.

ALL: Aw.

Please continue.

Then by the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and...

Wait!
Stop the wedding.

(ALL GASPING)

Barbie! Raquelle!

We object to this wedding.

<i>What? Can't a girl
get a husband around here?</i>

We object on the
grounds that the Princess

is acting under the
influence of a love potion.

Again with
this nonsense.

<i>Cover me. I'm going to try to get
to Graciella with the antidote.</i>

Someone get them now!

Hey, everybody, check out the new wings.



Barbie, look out.


Graciella! Look!


Barbie!

Grab her.

Raquelle! Catch.

Got it.

No one interrupts my wedding.

The antidote.


Barbie!

Heads up.

Graciella,
come back to me.



What? Where?

A wedding dress?

I remember everything.

I... I think I hear my
mom calling. Gotta fly.

Uh-uh. Not just yet.

<i>Crystal! You did give me
a love potion, didn't you?</i>

We were going through
your fashion pictures,

<i>and then you gave me a drink,
and that's when I saw...</i>

Oh, Len,
I am so, so sorry.

<i>Ken, actually,
but it's okay.</i>

<i>I get the sense you
weren't really yourself.</i>

No, I wasn't.
How could you?

All I wanted was a chance
with Zane. Not that it helped.

He loves you
no matter what.

I do.

Oh, Zane,
I love you, too.

Thank you for
bringing her back to me.

Yes, thank you.

Please, let me do
something for you in return.

Release Carrie and Taylor from the
dungeon and lift their banishment.

But they betrayed me.

The three of us were friends,

then they became so
close they cut me out.

<i>They don't remember it
that way at all.</i>

They don't?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Whee!
That was fun.

Carrie and Taylor,

did you or did you not
become best friends,

then betray me by
dropping me entirely?

No.

We only spent
time without you

because you got so busy with
royal duties, you were never free.

But you stopped even
inviting me to do things.

<i>We were sure you'd
say no, so we didn't try.</i>

That was a mistake.

We're sorry.
Can you forgive us?

If you can forgive me
for reacting so badly

instead of just talking to
you and learning the truth.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, guys.

<i>You know, as long as there's all
this forgiveness going around...</i>

I'll forgive you,
Crystal.

After you pay
for what you did.

I think doing every single bit of
cleaning after the wedding reception

<i>would be a fine punishment,
don't you?</i>

<i>Did you say
"wedding reception"?</i>

Yes.

I seem to remember you on one
knee asking me to marry you.

Is this a yes?

OFFICIANT: Do you,
Princess Graciella,

take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

Yes.

I now pronounce you Fairy
Princess and husband.

(ALL APPLAUDING)

Oh.

I've seen a lot of
incredible things today,

but nothing as weird as you
guys acting like friends.

Yeah.
Pretty cool, right?

Very cool.

And almost as cool as our
wings. Impressive, right?

<i>Okay, now I'm getting a real complex.</i>

(ALL LAUGHING)

Wait. How are we going to go
home when we have real live wings?

<i>I don't know. Can we?</i>

Of course you can.

Your wings will
disappear when you leave,

and magically reappear whenever
you come back to Gloss Angeles.

Perfect. We'll come back
all the time.

Wait until we tell
people about this place.

They'll be swarming
through the doors.

Uh, wait. Can you keep the Fairy Secret?

<i>The Fairy Secret is huge. We
can't keep it to ourselves.</i>

The paparazzi
will go nuts for it.

It'll mean huge publicity
for me and Barbie.

It'll be great for our
careers. Am I right?

<i>I don't know, Raquelle.</i>

<i>Let's not worry
about it right now.</i>

After all, you might
wake up in the morning

and think
this was all a dream.

<i>A dream?
There's no way.</i>

This has been the most
incredible experience of my life.

Mine, too.

A magic land, fairies
living in the human world.

Horses with wings.

Nearly getting
obliterated in a duel.

<i>I don't know. Maybe some things
wouldn't be so bad to forget.</i>

(ALL LAUGHING)

<i>It's been a great day,
Graciella,</i>

but we should
be getting back.

Thank you all
for everything.


Ken?

<i>Yeah, everything's okay. I feel
like I just had the weirdest dream.</i>

You did, too?

Yeah, Wally's. Half hour.

<i>I can't remember
any of the details.</i>

<i>It's like, it's almost
there, but I can't grab it.</i>

My dream, too.

But I know for sure your stylists
were in it. Carrie and Taylor, right?

<i>Yeah, Carrie and Taylor. They
were in mine, too. Oh, it's weird.</i>

But the really weird thing is I
have this incredibly strong feeling

that in the dream,

Raquelle and I,
we were friends.

Friends?

<i>I know. Like she'd ever let that happen.</i>

Hey. Mind if I join you?

I had a feeling you
were going to be here.

Sure, go ahead.

Really?

You're not going to sit
with Ken and flirt with him?

<i>Why would I do that?
He's your boyfriend.</i>

Oh! Super-cute outfit.
Where did you get it?

What?

<i>Nothing, it's just... You're
being really nice to me.</i>

Believe me, I like it.

<i>It's just different.</i>

<i>I know, it's weird.</i>

<i>I don't really get it, either,
but I had this dream last night,</i>

<i>and I can't remember
the details,</i>

but I woke up feeling like
we're friends. Good friends.

I had a dream
like that, too.

Weird.
Very weird.

TAYLOR: Hey.

We thought we might catch
the two of you here together.

You did?

We wanted to stop in
and say goodbye.

Goodbye?
Where are you going?

We reconnected
with an old friend,

so we're going to spend
some time in our hometown.

It was great hanging out
with you both, though.

We know we'll see you again.

Hanging out with you?
But I barely even know you.

Uh...

Look at the time.
Gotta fly. Bye.

Bye.

Wow. Looks like your
stylists skipped town.

<i>Guess we know one star who won't shine
as brightly on the next red carpet.</i>

Oopsie.

Guess old habits
die hard, girlfriend.

(ALL LAUGHING)

(BOTH SHUSHING)

<i>Sometimes I blend in
like a book on a shelf</i>

<i>Sometimes I wear my jeans
like anyone else</i>

<i>There's millions of chameleons
blending in all around</i>

<i>Sometimes I wanna be found</i>

<i>'Cause there is
so much more to me</i>

<i>More than I could ever show</i>

<i>If you wanna fly with me</i>

<i>There is one thing
I got to know</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>A secret</i>

<i>Sometimes what you see
is not what you get</i>

<i>Sometimes you haven't
seen anything yet</i>

<i>I'm not the same melody
that everyone sings</i>

<i>Can't you tell
I'm hiding my wings?</i>

<i>'Cause there is
so much more to me</i>

<i>More than I could ever show</i>

<i>If you wanna fly with me</i>

<i>There is one thing
I got to know</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>A secret</i>

<i>Come with me and you'll see
a world beyond your dreams</i>

<i>More than it seems</i>

<i>Come with me and you'll see
that you can fly like me</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

<i>A secret</i>
