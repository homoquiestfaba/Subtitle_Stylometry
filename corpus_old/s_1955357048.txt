(MONITOR BEEPING)

Um, Professor, um...

About that game tonight.

Not now, Richard.

Hi, Sam.
How's it going?

We can't talk to each other.
Why?

Set the frequencies. We can
only talk to the game master.

Oh. Well, you've really gone
all out here, Bradley.

Too bad you're gonna
lose tonight.

Never happened before.
Well, we've never played in
a real building before.

Take a look at this.

I designed the program
to come up with the code words
and clues.

And assign which classrooms
we're covering, the locations
of the weapons, the keys,

reveal crystals, all that.
And, watch this.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

(BRADLEY LAUGHS)

You were right.

The electronics lab had the
tracking equipment we were
looking for.

Transmitter. Tracker.

Ah...

SAM: Who's wearing that?
BRADLEY: Tracy.

I slipped her one in
her pocket. (CHUCKLES)

I can put trackers on every
floor. So, now, if all the
quest knights have these,

then, the game master can
monitor our progress through
the tower.

This is going to be our
best game

ever.

Professor Sorenson?

I just wanted to say that
that was an impressive bit
of work.

Did you want something,
Richard?

Well, I was just wondering
about the game tonight, sir.

Well, it sounds like a
marvelous opportunity to
hone one's mental skills.

That, it is.

But you'll have to ask Sam
about playing. It is his game.

(GARY LAUGHS)

Hey, pry your lips off the
professor's ass, I could do
with some help over here.

All right now, next review.

But, I'll be working long
hours at the hospital, and...

You'll have to stay home
and cook my meals, and,

like, mend my socks and give
me little Sams.

Yeah right, when pigs fly.
I'll be just as busy as you,
Sam.

Doing what?

Running my engineering
firm which I started.

Yeah, which you bought with
my money.

Ah! Sam!
Oh, hey, ho! Hey, hey! Ho!

He attacks milts and feminists
on command. Good boy, Herman.
That a boy, fella.

Come on, Richie, come on.
Look, I don't know, okay?

Well, you gotta answer, man.
Just answer.

Okay. Three.
Wrong!

There were only two, Rich,
you know.

I don't give a shit how many
little kids played the drummer
on The Partridge Family, okay?

That's because you have
no sense of culture. What you
guys do with Sorenson?

Oh, he's telling the class his
lip color joke.

His lip color?

SAM AND GARY: Never mind.

So, who's this poor fella?
That's Shakma.

Shakma?

What did you guys do to him?
We've injected corticotropin
in his brain.

TRACY: Gross.
No, it's actually quite
fascinating.

We've been working on a
stable version
of corticotropin.

Stable?
Well, it usually inhibits
aggression.

But, sometimes it has
the opposite effect.

TRACY: So why use this
poor monkey?

Baboon. Well, they're the
most aggressive primate.

Besides me.

I was training him.

Sam, don't be such
a girly man.

Like you?
(SHAKMA SNARLS)

RICHARD: (SHOUTING)
Get Sorenson!
-(ALARM GOES OFF)

(SHAKMA SHRIEKING)
Quick!

RICHARD: Sam!

Sam!

Sam.

(RICHARD YELLS IN PAIN)

(SHAKMA HOWLS)

What the hell happened here?
I didn't do anything!

He woke up and went berserk.
Go fix that alarm.

Sorry, old buddy.

What did you give him?

20 milligrams
of phenothiazine.

Well, hit him with
another 200.

That would kill him.
Let's not make it any worse.

Well, there's gotta be
something that you can...
Sam.

He would never be the same.

All those hours of research
gone up in smoke!

Oh, yeah, maybe if I...

Oh, whatever. Whatever.
Have somebody fix that arm.

-(ALARM CONTINUES)
All my jug of wine, and loaf
of bread need,

is thou.

Isn't that bothering you?

Oh, yeah.

You just wait one
second, okay?

(ALARM STOPS)

Now.

Where was I?

Okay, tell me if this hurts.

RICHARD: Ow! It hurts.

(RICHARD MOANS)

Sam, you okay?

Yeah. I'll be fine.

So, everything ready for
the game?

I hope you're not making it
too complicated. I have
a date tonight.

What do you know about
the game?

Oh, Sorenson suggested I play.

RICHARD: Thought it'd be
good for me.

Well, we, uh...

We have all the players,
I don't know where you'd
fit in.

Although...

We could have him...
We could make Nemesis
a real person.

Nemesis?

He's an ugly little demon,
Richard. You would be perfect.

So, what does he have to do?

You lurk in the caverns
awaiting the quest knights as
they move through the tower

to save the princess on
the top floor.

I'll do it.

By the way, you have to help
Sorenson set up.

I'll do it.

Damn.

Want me to do it?

No, I got it.

Sam, uh...

Gonna have to lose
the sensitive side if you plan
on being a doctor.

You're never gonna make
any money.

Well...

He was just getting tame, too.

I guess he's better off now,
anyway. Instead of being
cooped up in a cage.

Look, why don't I take it
from here?

Or it'll never get done.

What are you doing?

I thought you wanted me
to cremate him.

Did I say that?

Yes sir, back in the lab.

I have to do a necropsy.

Whatever you say.
Yeah, you just leave him
right there.

Yeah, I'll come in and...
What is today?

Friday?

I'll come in tomorrow and
I'll do it.


Laura, God.

So, where you taking
me tonight?

I've gotta stay late and help
Sorenson.

Richard...
Listen, this is a good chance
for me

to be around him outside
of class.

But you promised.

It won't take long, okay?

And, um...

We can go back to your place.

And discuss maybe,
primitive mating rituals
maybe?

You've been around these
monkeys too long.
Oh yeah?

Have I?

Hey! There she is!
Hi!

Have you seen my brother
lately?
I'm heading that way now.

Are you getting ready for
the game tonight?

Yeah, you still gonna be
our princess?

Yeah, I'd love to. If you're
not mad at me.

Mad? Why would I be mad
at you?

For letting it slip about
the game in front of Richard.

Oh, you were the one.

Yeah. I'm really sorry.

Well, that's okay. We just
have to be careful,
that's all.

So, all I have to is wait
on the top floor?

It's a big honor, the princess
is the object of our quest.
Is it okay with your parents?

Parents?

Come on, Sam, how old do you
think I am?

(MAKES KISSING NOISES)

Okay, okay, okay. Break it
up, break it up.

Brought you the computer
programs for tonight.

And, this attractive young
woman who claims to be related
to you.

Oh.

This looks like a lot of work.

Oh, not really. The computer
did most of it.

All you have to do is set up
the building the way it says

and then follow Sorenson's
orders during the game.

Game? That's what you're
doing tonight?

Yeah, Richard's Nemesis.

Nemesis.

Yeah, he's an unbeatable
enemy.

Or the Greek goddess
of vengeance.

Oh, great. I'm dating the
goddess of vengeance.

Hey, it's only gonna take
a couple hours, okay?

Well, uh...
Not necessarily.

Last time we played the game,
it went well into the wee
hours of the morning,

and that was just sitting
around a table.

Terrific. Well, you children
have fun.

Hey, Laura...
Hey, why me?

You make the perfect goddess.

Hey, be at the faculty lounge
at 7:30.

All right.
Oh...

(APES SHRIEKING)

(SHRIEKING GROWS LOUDER)
(CAGES RATTLING)


All right. Everything's pretty
much ready. Is Richard
here yet?

Go fish.

Ah, do you got any twos?

Go fish.

Professor, I've checked
the building and it's empty.
Over.

All right. I have set the
patterns on floors two,
three, and four,

and all I'm waiting for now is
for Richard to actually go in
and turn the lights on or off.

And to set the clues in all
of the rooms. Over.

I'm sure he's on his way.
Over.

Oh yeah, I'm sure.
Over and out.


You idiot.

Hey, if we're gonna be doctors
we gotta learn to think on our
toes, right?

See, I got this for Richard.
We make him wear this all
night, right?

And that'll teach him
to butt in.

Anyway, what I was about to
say before I browned my
shorts, thank you very much,

perhaps we should lay
a little money down on this
game tonight.

Say...

A c-note?

Make it five c-notes and
you've got yourself a deal.
What?

That's too much.
TRACY: Why, don't you
think you're gonna win?

Oh, you need a loan.
Do you have $500
laying around?

Okay, okay.

All right, I'm in.
Oh!

Then that's settled.

TRACY: Yeah.

TRACY: Yeah.
$500?

Where is everybody?

Ah, they're all inside.
So they won't see which rooms
are lit.

So, what am I supposed to do
while you're in playing with
your little friends?

Hey, this is not gonna take
long. Check back in
three hours.

Yeah, right.
Hey!

Three hours!

What makes you think you're
in better shape than I am
anyway, huh?

I said 7:30.

Hey, I got held up.

You know how it is.

Yeah, Richard. We know you're
a big boy.

What's this?

GARY: Well, Nemesis has to
wear it.

We have to tell the good guys
from the bad guy.

This just gets better
and better.

Professor, I found Richard and
he's on his way down.
Over and out.

Richard, did you forget to do
the fifth floor?

It's all labs. I thought we'd
leave most of it lit.

Oh, no, that makes it too
easy. Now go back and
follow the charts.

The computer lab is a cavern.
See, it should be dark.

The bio lab...
Well, I was thinking.

There's $100,000 of
equipment back there.

Shouldn't they be secured?

I'm locking the building
outside, I think we can trust
our own group.

Well, I know,
but I was just...
Richard.

Go make the changes.

Yes sir. Whatever you say.

Okay. Building's locked up
tight. Nobody gets out till
we have a rescued princess,

and a defeated demon.

I'll pass these out.
Oh Brad, I've given each
one of the homing devices

an identity of its own,
so just for fun,

let's try and figure out which
character you are, huh?

Oh great!
Huh!

All right, well, go down to
the second floor as soon as
you're ready.

Oh, your starting locations
are on the scrolls inside.

Yeah, I'll start contacting
you in a few minutes.

Let the game begin.

It looks like fun.

I hope so.

Now, did Sorenson give you
the code phrase?

Yeah.

Now remember, don't come
out until you hear it recited
in order.

I know, I know. I'll be here.
Suitably distressed and
awaiting rescue.

And I have a little surprise.

A surprise?

You'll see.

Good luck.

Thanks.

Game master to Sam,
I'm back in my office.
Have you started? Over.

Game master, I'm in room 208
and I've collected an amulet
and a clue,

and I'm requesting a key to
continue my quest in room 210.
Over.

Your request is granted.
You have four keys left.
Good luck. Over and out.

Game master to Tracy.
How are you proceeding?
Over.

Just fine game master, I just
picked up my first clue and
two keys

one of which I'd like to try
on room 211. Over.

Very good. I'll make
a note of it. Good luck.
Over and out.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

COMPUTER VOICE:
Haveth ye the code?

Right. Collect,
pass and proceed.

Professor? Over.

Go ahead. Over.

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
By George, I think
I've got it.

If the vials are separated
by date,

that would mean the first
two letters must be...

Oh, now wait...

Never mind.

Game master?
Sir Bradley here again. Over.

Yeah, I'm here.
Go ahead. Over.

I'd like a key to room 414.
Over.

Okay, hold on a minute.
Over.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

All right. I've got you.
You have now two keys left.
Over.

Sir Bradley over and out.

SORENSON: Tough luck,
Sir Bradley.

(DOOR OPENING)

Game master.

Sir Bradley again.

I have the clue I needed.
And I'm going to try it out

on the wizard. Over.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

Okay, good luck. Over.

Richard. Over.

Yes, game master. Over.

Where are you? Over.

Four-fourteen, sir.

Isn't that where I'm supposed
to be? Over.

Bradley was just in there.
What happened? Over.

Um... I must have
fallen asleep.

Sorry. Over.

Damn it, Richard.

Pay attention or this is going
to be one short game. Over.

You bet.

I've got the clue and I'm
going to try...



I think I just turned Nemesis.

I'm going into the specimen
room. Over.

Bradley,

where did you say
you were going? Over.

The specimen room.

I think Nemesis
is hiding inside.

the chance

to receive eternal life.

Over and out.

Hold demon and give...

Oh, God.

(SHAKMA SHRIEKS)

(COMPUTER BUZZES)

Bradley. Over.

Game master to Bradley.
Over.

Damn, Gary and I are the only
ones left on this level?

We gotta work faster.

Richard? Over.

What is it, you old coot?

Richard here. Over.

Where are you? Over.

Are you getting senile
on us, or what?

Still in 414, sir. Over.

Well, since you missed
Bradley,

perhaps we should
relocate you.

We'll put you in room 524.

Before you settle in
check on Bradley.

Tell him that his homing
device and walkie-talkie

are not working. It's a
battery I suppose. Over.

I'm on my way.

Miserable old dinosaur.

Okay, let me know
when you're in position.

Over and out.

You manipulative
little brat.

Okay, Bradley...

(WALKIE-TALKIE STATIC)


SORENSON OVER WALKIE-TALKIE:
Bradley?

Richard is heading your way.

Now look, he is not Nemesis.

He's coming over
to lock the lab.

Over.


RICHARD: Shit...




Richard, did you find Bradley?
Over.

Richard, wake up! Over.

Game master, this is Sam.
Over.

Um, go ahead, Sam.
Over.

I'd like to try the clue
in room 408. Over.

Okay, go ahead.

You've got one key left.
Over and out.


I have a reveal crystal,
hand over your notebook.

You're taking this seriously.

Yeah, well, $1,500
is the down payment

on my new car.
Let me see this.

explains the bet.

Sam, you don't have anything.

I know. I'm having a problem
on this level.

Well, I can see that.

Game master, this is Tracy.

I just ran into Sam and I
claimed his notebook,

but I found nothing so
I'm moving on. Over.

Well, I'm glad you're both
there.

I've gotta go down
and check on Richard. Over.

Is everything okay? Over.
Nothing.

Except I do think he's playing
a different game

than the rest of us. Over.

Would you like us to
hold our positions? Over.

There's no need.
I'll be right back.

Over and out.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't run off.

Sam, not now.
Why not?

'Cause Bradley's ahead of me.

So? Take a breather.

Sam, you're so male.

I can't help it.

I'm the giant.

You're the giant.
Mmm-hmm.

I thought you were the...
I thought you...

Oh, I see what I did wrong.

And that makes me the elf.

I thought these caverns were
supposed to be dark.

Sam. (GIGGLES)

I'm glad to see you have such
a firm grasp of the rules.

Okay, Sam, now's your chance.

Rescue me.

(SOFT GROWL)




What?

Shakma.

I thought you put him
to sleep.

So did I.

Where's the damn elevator?

Something's jamming the door.
What?

(SHAKMA SHRIEKING)

Professor.

Hello?

Professor Sorenson,
come in please.

Professor Sorenson,
if you can hear me

(IN FOREIGN ACCENT)
I've got a transit pass here

and I'm giving it to
level four, Captain.

Now I'm gonna catch
those guys.

Don't you think
we should get help?

I think I can handle it.

All right, I'm going in.

If I'm not back in two minutes
call security, okay?

Okay. Be careful.

Profess?

(SHAKMA GROWLING)

I don't know if this thing
is working or not,

but if you can hear me
I'm going up

to the fourth level now.
Over and out.


For that matter,
I don't know if anything

around here is working.

Who's that?

Gary?

Is that you?

Nobody's getting my clues.


Sam.
Shh.

on the stairs.


Easy, boy.

It's me. Easy, boy.

Easy.

Open the door!

What's wrong with him?

That stupid stuff
made him crazy!

Did you see anybody out there?

No.

But there's blood everywhere.
Oh, my God.

We've gotta get to a phone.
Oh, my God.

Can't he open doors?

Yeah, but the stairwell door's
too heavy for him.

At least I think it is.
Check that side.

Locked.
It's the same on this side.

Locked.

Damn.

So, what are we going to do?

The only phones are in
the teachers' offices.

Move.

That's not going to help.

We gotta do something.

Whoever's down there could be
hurt real bad.

Damn! Sorenson had Gary
turn it off this afternoon.

Well, then we have to go
to the other floors

and check for phones.

No, we don't have time,
we gotta get them out.

We gotta keep Shakma busy.

I've got it.


(FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE)


What is it?

It's a high-intensity light
strobe. It's blind him.

Blind him?

Well, temporarily as long as
the batteries last.

All right, well show me
how it works.

Why? I'm going with you.

No, you go find the others.

After we find out
what happened.

You can't do everything, Sam,
no matter how macho you are.

Now, let's go.

Sam.

Fire!

The animals.

One thing at a time.
Can you hold this?

Can you hold this?
Hold it!

Sam!

Hurry!

TRACY: Sam? Sam, hurry!

Sam!

Sam, he's getting out!

Go to the stairs.
Go, go, go!

(SHAKMA SHRIEKING)

(SHRIEKING STOPS)

Oh, Sam.

Sam.

Is he...

That must be Richard in there.

You said you saw
his hand move?

I think so.
I don't know, it flashed.

I don't know.
Tracy,

I need you to make
a distraction, so I can
get in and pull him out.

Distraction?

Tracy, I'd tell it the other
way around, but I don't think
you can lift him.

(TRACY SCREAMS)

(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Sam, it's coming your way!

(SHAKMA GROWLS)

Shak! Shak!


Come on Shak!


Tracy?


(SHAKMA SHRIEKS)

Tracy!

Tracy you okay?

(SHAKMA BREATHING HEAVILY)



Sam, he's over.
Sam!

Sam he's over here!

Shak!

Shak, stay!

Shak, Shak, come on Shakma!

Come on!

Shak, Shakma!

Hey!

Sit.

Stay Shakma.

Stay.

Leave it.

(SHAKMA SQUEALS)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)


Shakma, Shakma!

(SHAKMA SQUEALS)

(SHAKMA SQUEALS)

His foot!

Get it out! Hurry!



So, what do we do now?

We gotta get out of here.

What are you doing?
I'm looking for his keys.

What about Richard?

They're not here.

Could be anywhere!

Sam!
He's dead!

Richard is dead!
So, what now?

Where are you going?

I'm going down to check
the basement door.

Is this part of the game, Sam?

Look! This is not my fault.

We should have never been
in here.

We have to find the others.

Then we can go to the lower
level and break a window
or something and go for help.

I'll go up to the sixth floor
and look for Bradley.

he was on the third floor,
I'll start there.

If you find a phone
at an open office,
then call security.

Sam?

Be careful.

It's alright. He can't get off
the fifth floor.

Be careful anyway.


(LAB EQUIPMENT FALLING)




Bradley?

Gary, Gary!

Gary, come on out,
this is an emergency,
the game's over!

Gary, this isn't a trick,
come on out!

Gary!

(STATIC SOUND)

Okay,
this is the last time here.

Professor Sorenson,
do you copy?


Fine. I'm going on to
the fifth level, over now.

Gary!

Gary!

Gary!

The hell?


Yes, yes, Professor,
I'm here.

I'm going up to
the fifth floor, the code word
was Merlin.

Gary?

Is that you?
Where are you? Over.

Tracy? What are you
doing in my frequency?
Over.

Gary, listen to me.

Take the stairs up to
the sixth floor,

whatever you do don't go on to
the fifth, over.

What is going on here, Tracy?

Where's Sorenson, anyway?


Gary?

Where are you now? Over.

I'm in the elevator and
I'm on my way up to six.

Is this one of your little
tricks, missy? Over.

Gary,

get out of the elevator!

You want that $1,500
pretty bad.

The game's over!

Kim?

Kim, come out!

Kimberly, where are you?

(GLASS SHATTERING)

What you do that for?

What's the matter with you?

Didn't you hear me?

You didn't say the code word.

Sam, you're bleeding!

I've got to talk to you.

Do you like my outfit?

Aw, no thank you,
Mrs. Nornum.

I just thought he may have
gone home.

I'll wait a little longer.

Yes, ma'am.
I'll have him give you a call.

Kay.

Thank you, bye.


What about Richard?

We know he's on five, but.

What if he's hurt?

What if he's bleeding?

Well, if...
Kim.

Most important thing,
is to get everybody together.

Then we can find a way
out and go for help.

Is there a phone in here?

No, I already looked.

Okay,
let's go find the others.

Sam,

wait one second.

We should take these.
Good idea.

Sam, wait!

That's Laura's car
down there.

Laura!

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

She heard me!

Well try it with me,
one, two, three.

BOTH: Laura!

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

Laura!

No, this isn't going to work.

We need something that we can
throw through the vent.

Something we can hit
her car with.
Yeah.

Alright, I'll look around
to the faculty lounge.

Alright I'm going downstairs
to get Tracy.

Go upstairs, quickly.
What are you gonna do?

I'm going in there.
What?

Well I'll go with you.

No.
Yes!

I could help you.
Go upstairs and wait for me.

No! I want to help you.
Listen to me!

Get out of here.

Sam, I'm not leaving you.

Kay?

Please don't stay.

Did you get Laura?
No.

You can help me best

if you go upstairs
and get Laura.

Listen to me.

Okay?
(SOBS)

Okay?

Okay.

Okay.

I'll wait till I hear
the door close.

(DOOR CLOSES)

All right.

(LOUD FUNK MUSIC ON CAR RADIO)

Come on.
