<i>Don't be scared.</i>

<i>You gonna be okay.</i>

I know it don't feel like it
right now.

'Cause all you feel is afraid.

But you got me.

You didn't used to,
but you do now.

See, I was where you was
67 days ago.

Mm-hmm.

They say it's bad to count,
but..

You just get so used to it.

Sometimes I wish I was back.

I do. You'll see.

You miss things.

Things you never
thought you'd miss.

They say the prophet

wouldn't want us
talkin' like this.

'Cause you unclean.

But I'm unclean, too.

<i>I think if he
saw your suffering</i>

<i>the way he saw mine..</i>

...I think he'd understand.

He saw it
and lifted it right up.

You gonna be okay.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, I know. I know.

<i>Mo, get me a cart!</i>

Beatin' up on
helpless animals!

That make you feel right?

<i>Get outta my way.
That is a life!</i>

<i>You hear me?
That's a life.</i>

<i>It's a damn dog.</i>

<i>I'm gonna tell you again
to get out of my way</i>

<i>before I move you.</i>

So move me.

I'm callin' the cops!

Yeah, what can we do for you?

<i>Oh, wait.
Here comes the cavalry.</i>

Hey. I know you, boy?

<i>Hey, you're the Cyclops.
Mo, just, get back inside.</i>

Hey, hey. Come on back here.

Both of you, come on.

<i>A little closer.</i>

Ah! You're him, alright.

A free man.

After all this time now.

Tsk!
It must really be something.

<i>Hmm. You know, you got a felon
on the books here.</i>

<i>You know that?</i>

I do. But it ain't him.

Yeah. Innocent, my ass.

I don't care
what the courts say.

You know, an innocent man

<i>he don't do the things
that you did in lockup.</i>

Can you, please,
just leave us alone?

<i>I've seen what you done
to those little girls.</i>

I've seen the pictures.

He didn't do nothin'!

That's not what I heard.

No, that's not what I heard.

<i>Not gonna make it, Mo.</i>

Beat up too bad.

Punctured lung,
internal bleeding.

We gotta help him pass.
No, he gonna make it.

He'll make it.

We'll give him the night.

But if he's still
suffering tomorrow

we gotta put him down.

Sh-shh. We're here.

You okay?

No, I ain't.

Don't listen to nobody.

Especially some good old boy
with a badge.

First couple months are hard.

Gets easier.

Poor thing.

You alone can forgive sins

so grant me forgiveness
and mercy.

<i>Thank you for your call.
You've reached Mohamed Lundy.</i>

Um, I'm outside right now.

So, um, you can..

<i>Hi. This is Mohamed.</i>

<i>I'm, I'm, I'm not here,
so you can leave your..</i>

<i>You have reached Mohamed,
and he's not here right now.</i>

<i>He's, um..</i>

<i>I bet you didn't sleep
last night, huh?</i>

<i>My first night was hard, too.</i>

<i>Beat up. Scared of the noise.</i>

<i>They say you make it
through that first night</i>

<i>and you can
make it through any of 'em.</i>

<i>They got no saying
for when you get out, though.</i>

<i>Hold on. Just..</i>

<i>Just hold on.</i>

Shh. It's okay.
You're alright.

You're okay, baby.

You're just tired.

You're just tired.

Mohamed?

It ain't right
what he did to that dog.

But it happens.

Every last one of 'em,
I wanna break their damn necks.

Ain't no rules out here.

<i>Killed a helpless dog,
ain't nobody does nothin'.</i>

Things don't get settled
the way they do on the inside!

Give it time.

Stuff starts to make more sense
each day you're out.

We should bury him.

Disposal regulation.
They'll give me hell.

Hey.

Hey!

Our drugs are locked up now.

Go out the way you came.

Ain't nobody
got to know about this.

Huh?

...Charlie

You need help? Want me
to call you somebody?

Ma'am?

Whoa!

Why won't you..
Ma'am.

Ma'am, now,
there's a van outside.

I'll get you anywhere you need
to go if you're in trouble.

Hey, miss. Miss!

You gotta, you gotta stop here.
You're gonna help me find him.

I can help you
if you just..

You have to help me
find him.

They didn't mean to.

They didn't mean to.
Hey, now.

You're scaring
me now. Don't..

Ma'am. Ma'am..

Hey. Hey, hey!

Hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey, ma'am. Ma'am, help me.

Hey, ma'am.

You alright? You alright?

Help, somebody!

Hey, I didn't..

...touch you,
I didn't touch you.

I didn't touch you.

<i>The lady from the Innocence
Project called this morning.</i>

Wanted to see how you're doin'.

Said you're doin' fine.

Workin' on your people skills.

You know, it strikes me
you don't seem too happy.

To be out, I mean.

Most folks would be doing
backflips

to have their names
cleared like that.

Be outta Angola.

Breathin' fresh air like a real,
live person.

Bury the past.

Or it'll bury you, boy.

You hear?

How you doin', ma'am?

<i>Bismillah.</i>

Now, you need to put
that knife down.

You stay away from me!

Get outta my way!
I'm gonna let you leave now.

You need to understand
somethin' first.

Get outta my way!
No, you need to know..

Listen to me! Listen to me!

Listen to me, listen.

I didn't hurt you,
I didn't touch you.

I didn't touch you.
And you asked me to help you.

Understand? You understand?

Now listen..
I'm not afraid of you!

You ain't gotta be
afraid of me. No.

You get outta my way.

I, I, I will let you leave.

You get outta my way!
I'm gonna let you leave!

But you, you need to know.
I didn't hurt you.

It's very important.
Who are you?

Nobody. Hang on.

You're one of them?
You're one of his friends?

Yeah? You're one of his friends
who watched me?

Oh, we never met!
Who are you?

I work at the shelter. Yeah.

Dog shelter. You brought in that
mutt got beat up real bad?

You know, in that pickup truck?

Charlie. Charlie, his name..

You, you know Charlie?

Yeah.
That's, that's your dog.

I'm not, it's not happening.

Hey-hey-hey-hey.
Lady, lady, stay with me now.

No-no, I didn't watch you,
I didn't watch you.

Just calm down now. Now breathe.
You get on.

<i>That sound good?</i>

<i>Yeah? Alright.</i>

Alright.
Alright, now.

What's you name?

<i>You can tell me.
It's alright, it's okay.</i>

<i>Doris.
Doris?</i>

Doris, I'm, I'm Mohamed.

<i>We drove here?
That's right, we drove here.</i>

<i>I didn't know
if you was in trouble</i>

<i>somebody's after you, but I,
I just wanted to help you.</i>

<i>You asked me to help you.
You didn't hurt me?</i>

I didn't put a hand on you.

Then what do you want?

Nothin'.

No. You want just some water?

Get you some water. Yeah.

Here you go. Here.

Try it.

It's alright, just take it.
That's it. Yeah. That's it.

That's it.

Yeah? Feel better?

Just breathe. Just breathe.

<i>Police!</i>

<i>Police! Open the door!</i>

<i>Police, open up!</i>

Sir, we got some reports
of a domestic disturbance.

You wanna tell your wife
or girlfriend

or so forth to come to the door?

Oh, ain't nobody here but me,
officer.

Oh, is that right?
Martin, right?

You two acquainted?
Don't you watch the news?

Will you open up
a little bit?

Holy shit.

Yeah, Martin Lundy.

Hey! You mind if we come in?

Yeah, you go on.

Is there someone else here,
sir?

Like I said,
there ain't no one but me.

Well, let's just
make sure about that.

<i>What's all the noise about,
Martin?</i>

I was exercisin'.

<i>Going at it hard, huh? Shit.</i>

My lovely Latina partner's
gonna take a look around.

Make sure you're not
making lampshades

outta ladies
in a back room someplace.

Doesn't look like you're big
on lampshades, actually.

The Cyclops!

The Beast of Angola.

<i>You're a damn legend, son.</i>

Tore a lotta fellows
up on the inside, huh?

I heard even them
gang-bangin' niggers

wouldn't go near the Cyclops.

That's impressive.

White as you are.

Very impressive, Martin.

It's Mohamed.

You're a real Movie
of the Week, aren't you, boy?

You got an animal in there,
Mr. Mohamed?

Yeah, it's a dog from the
shelter. I'm workin' down there.

We're good.
You like dogs?

I'm allergic.
I love 'em.

Bring it out, let's see it.

<i>I can't. She's sleepin' now.</i>

<i>Wake it up. Come on.</i>

<i>Come on, Eric.
I'll be sneezin' all damn day.</i>

<i>No, she needs to sleep now.
I say, wake it up.</i>

<i>That's a sick dog
right there.</i>

<i>Wake it up, boy!</i>

She's an old dog, sir.
She's sick.

Eric.

You have a nice day, Mr. Lundy.

Ma'am.

Come on.

Come on, now.
They're gone.

I was just making dinner.

I see.

Now, come on out.

Come on.

Thank you.

It's alright.

Mm, look at this.

<i>Melanie?</i>

<i>Details are still unfolding,
but police say</i>

<i>they're dedicating all available resources.
He was just here.</i>

...to the investigation
of Long's murder

and the search for his wife.

They do consider Doris Long
a person of interest

<i>and they're not ruling out
the possibility</i>

<i>that she could be a suspect.</i>

<i>Or another potential victim.
Was she with him when he came?</i>

<i>Police say are devastated
though by Sergeant Long's loss</i>

<i>and they say
he was very well liked.</i>

God, I don't even know how.

<i>We're following
this story closely</i>

<i>of course and will bring you
live updates</i>

<i>as more details
become available.</i>

<i>Hope she's okay.
Live, here at the scene, Melanie Hebert..</i>

Paperwork right there
for you.

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>I can't sleep.</i>

Just keep thinking
about Charlie and.

<i>I just can't sleep.</i>

Did you just move in
or something?

Not a lot
of furniture or anything.

Did you have enough of it?

I sure did.

Now, he's dead.

Do you want me to go?

I can go.

I don't know.

I don't know.

<i>I still wake up
and think I'm there.</i>

<i>With the cracks
in the ceiling.</i>

<i>The footsteps.</i>

<i>The heavy curtains.</i>

<i>But I'm not.</i>

<i>I'm here
with these white walls.</i>

<i>Where I can breathe.</i>

<i>And there are no mistakes.</i>

<i>Just relief.</i>

Nobody wanted it.

Give it a try.

Want me to sit in it?

Yeah! Go on.

Yeah, it's nice.

Hey..

...I wanted to ask
about Charlie, my dog.

Is he okay?
Or did he.

He probably
didn't make it, did he?

Yeah, he's okay.

Really?

Oh, that's great.
That's good.

I was really sure
he wasn't gonna make it.

Where's your dog?

Oh, it's just for dogs
I bring home from the kennel.

Oh. That's nice.

You finished with this?

Sorry.

It's my fault
what happened to Charlie

'cause he was
trying to protect me.

Ain't your fault.

Your husband.

I've known
a lot of men like him.

And they don't stop.

So, the bed in the closet,
is that for a dog, too?

No, that's me,
I don't really care

too much for open spaces.

You sleep in the closet?

Yeah.

You fit in there?

Yeah.

Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

That's better
than prison chow, huh?

You know, I had one of those
Nutraloafs once on a dare.

What you all call that inside?
Confinement loaf?

Woo! That's somethin' awful.

You know, I always thought
it was cruel and unusual

to put all that mushy,
wormy food together

in a pile of shit
and call that dinner.

What is it that you want?
What do I want?

You don't wanna know
what I want.

What I would like is to ask you
some questions about a dead cop.

My boss said to leave you alone.

He said that
you been through enough.

Yeah. He and I
don't agree on much.

I'll see you soon.

Why do you do that?

To be clean in front of God.
Then I pray.

Sounds beautiful,
the praying.

Thank you.

<i>Did you grow up doing that?</i>

Nah.

I learned this in prison.

Why not Jesus?

Christians..

...they always wanted me
to confess somethin'.

I didn't have nothin'
to confess.

Islam never asked that of me.

<i>Islam. What does that mean?</i>

It means surrender.

Why are you helping me?

If I get caught,
you go back to prison, right?

Probably, yeah.

Well, I don't want that
to happen.

So, I should go.
No, you can stay.

You, you stay.

Okay.

<i>My Lord,
please forgive me.</i>

<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

Sorry. This... bother you?

Mm-mm.

You got me clothes.

Yeah. I don't know much
about 'em.

It's perfect.

Good. I figured
you gonna need 'em.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

If you wanna sleep in
the closet, it's okay with me.

Are you sure about that?
Mm-hmm.

Appreciate it.

Mr. Lundy!

You're a hard man
to get on the phone.

Yeah, you're a hard man to get,
in general.

Oh, it's not smart,
puttin' your back on me.

Should've learned that inside.

What's this?

Linda, right?

I don't have
to tell you anything.

Not sure that's true.

This is a private business.

Unless you got a warrant,
or some reason to be here

you ain't welcome.

You know why
they call him Cyclops?

<i>Warrant.</i>

Yeah, the Aryan Brothers
gave him that name

when he took
his cellmate's eye out.

Said he kept it.
17 years old.

Monsters don't grow up, Linda.

They just hide in the closet
until they get hungry.

You put a kid
in that gladiator school

with all them animals,
what'd you expect?

Justice.

He's peaceful now.
That's all that matters.

I'm just gonna
poke around here

and ask Mr. Lundy
a few questions.

I could come back
with a warrant.

Mohamed's been through
enough, is all.

I'm just doin' police work.

Be quick, real quick.

Boss said I could
poke around a little.

You really love that right
to remain silent, huh?

Oh, come on, Martin.

You know I'm not goin' anywhere
until we have a little chat.

We could do that right here, or
we could go down to the station.

You know Doris Long?
No.

Yeah, I didn't think so.

Makes sense you don't know
each other.

The funny thing is, we lose
her trail right around here

after the night of the murder.

Like someone
was waitin' for her.

That John.

Oh, he was not well behaved.

A bit of a hot head,
nobody liked him.

Someone a girl might
wanna get rid of.

<i>Girl that felt trapped.</i>

<i>No hope.</i>

<i>No place to go.</i>

<i>Friends always
lookin' the other way.</i>

<i>Probably lasts for years.</i>

<i>Someone had
to help her, right?</i>

Maybe someone
who didn't like cops much.

Somebody who put a prison guard
in a coma for 2 months.

Permanent brain damage.

Now, you remember
that, Martin? Hmm?

Remember his name?

Hmm? Remember?

Hey, I'm talkin' to you!
That fucking pig starved me.

There you are.

There you are.

His name was Ronnie.
That was his name.

Ronnie.

Anyway, we'll get all settled.

We always do.

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>Hmm.
You asleep?</i>

<i>No.</i>

Who are you?

<i>What?
I mean.</i>

<i>Well, you wanna know
why I got locked up?</i>

No. No, I don't care
about that.

<i>I just mean,
I spend all day here</i>

<i>surrounded by
your things, and.</i>

I don't really know who you are.

I ain't no one.

Well, that's not true.
I mean.

You don't like furniture
obviously.

<i>You work with dogs.</i>

<i>You like to pray a lot.</i>

And you're nice to me.

So, that makes you someone.

<i>Right?</i>

<i>Don't you have any family?</i>

I got a sister, I think.

Somewhere in Alabama
last time I heard.

Well, what's she like?

<i>She can draw real good</i>

<i>ever since
she was really little.</i>

Yeah?

<i>That girl draw like
it was takin' a picture.</i>

She'd come up with paper..

...draw a fence or whatever
in front of her.

And she'd hand it to me like
it was a test.

"Now, you do it. "

She'd hand it to me 'cause
she knew I was gonna mess it up.

I always messed it up.

<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

<i>Long time.</i>

<i>I have a brother.</i>

His name is Darren.

And he's what they call
a "Tree doctor. "

<i>And he had this big book
of different types of trees.</i>

<i>And he would quiz me
on them, too.</i>

He was always
much smarter than me.

And better looking.
He's very handsome.

Like a movie star.

Are we friends?

Sure.

<i>I ain't never been</i>

<i>been really good
talkin' to women.</i>

They locked me up
when I was 15

and had no practicing.

Ain't never really had a chance.

I hope I'm gonna be okay.

<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

Charlie?

<i>Charlie.</i>

<i>Charlie.</i>

<i>Charlie, here.</i>

<i>Are you okay, hon?
Mm-hmm.</i>

You sure?

Thanks.

I'm sorry. I got locked out.

Why are you outside?
I made a mistake. I.

Why are you outside?
I got locked out. I'm sorry.

Come on!

I made a mistake, Mo.
I'm sorry.

<i>What?
She saw me, she saw me.</i>

<i>Who?
She's gonna call the.</i>

Your neighbor. She's, she
looked right at my face.

Why did you go outside?
I don't know, I don't know!

I thought I saw Charlie. Okay?
What?

<i>I thought I saw him, but.</i>

I swear to God, I thought
I saw him outside!

<i>What?
I don't know. I'm sorry.</i>

I'm sorry, I ruined it.
I ruined it.

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

The cops are at my work.

Here, they're comin'.

It's okay.

Okay. I'm gonna have to go.

Because if
they catch you here

I know they'll put you
back away.

Hold on. Hold on.
If they catch you here, they could take you back.

Listen to me.
And I don't want you to go back!

Listen.
Listen, I ain't goin' back.

And you're not gonna
turn yourself in, okay?

I'm not?
No.

No, no, no.

I don't, I don't wanna go back.

I know!
I'm not talkin' about prison.

I ain't sayin' that.

I don't wanna go back.

You understand?

Me neither.

Okay?

Alright. Okay.

I know somebody.
I know somebody's gonna help us.

Okay.
Yeah?

Go get your stuff.

Okay.
Go get your stuff.

Back up! Back up!

How many with you?

Just her.

<i>I saw somethin'
in the trees.</i>

It's just us.

<i>As-Salamu Alaikum.</i>

<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

You're a whole lot more paranoid
than I remember.

You don't remember much.

You wanna put
the gun down now?

More than anything, brother.

More than anything.

Come in.

Mm-mm. No. Absolutely not.

<i>I wouldn't ask you if.
If what?</i>

If you actually cared
about protecting my way of life?

No. If I had other options.

You bring a murderer
into my home

and ask me to risk my life,
my freedom!

Not just sheltering her, but
taking you across the border?

Why not North? Most of that
border is just a wire fence.

'Cause they're gonna find us
there, and you know that.

I'm not askin' you
to get us across.

I'm just askin' you to get us
to someone who can.

Who?

Those Low Riders
from Corpus Christi.

You did business with them.
They move things.

Yeah. Heard those charmers
did Crispy Black real bad.

Cut him up
like a fucking carrot cake.

It's just yard gossip, man.

Low Riders are punks.
Brotherhood errand boys.

You know that.

How you gonna pay 'em?

Oh, I'm gonna pay 'em.

Look, I'm callin' in
my favor right now.

<i>We can't make it across
on our own.</i>

<i>Too many people
lookin' for us.</i>

Why don't I just take you?

You been havin' much luck
at the border these days?

Fair enough.

Okay.

Okay?
Yeah, what?

You want me to say it twice?
Yeah.

<i>I don't know, man. It was his
purity that I admired most.</i>

The way he never gave up.

Livin' alone
for all those years in caves?

Cold-ass nights
in the desert? Ah.

<i>Only ever wanting one thing.</i>

<i>One thing. And riskin'</i>

<i>dedicating
his whole life to it.</i>

Like Sisyphus.

Rolling that fuckin' boulder
up the hill

just to watch it
roll back down.

Drove me to tears, bro.

You know

in a way, Wile E. Coyote taught
me more about loss

and righteousness, in a way
that prison never could.

But that fuckin' Road Runner.

<i>That stupid, ostrich-looking
little piece of shit</i>

with that stupid
smile and that noise.

Always fucking with him.

I liked him!

He was always happy, even though

he was being chased
by some maniac

who always
wanted to kill him.

Yeah, easy to be happy
when you win all the time.

Surviving and winning aren't
the same thing.

You got a smart one here.

<i>Hey.</i>

I heard from Akasha.
No.

My, my brother-in-law said
he, uh, came to Brooklyn

lookin' for work or a girlfriend
or some shit.

Is he still cross-eyed?

Who's Akasha?

So, Akasha, this poor
fucker used to get in trouble

with the screws all the time

because they could never
tell if he was

lookin' at them or not.

Drove 'em fuckin' apeshit.

So, one day, to fuck with him

me and a few brothers
told him that

if he got hit real hard, it
might straighten out his eyes.

And he's not too smart,
so he believed it.

<i>Kid was fuckin' desperate.</i>

So, naturally, we told him to go
get the Cyclops to hit him

because this motherfucker
was a terror.

I mean, Aryans wouldn't
even sneeze at him.

Khalil.
What? Come on.

The past is the past.

So, he goes up to this brother

<i>and starts shovin' him
at chow, you know?</i>

<i>And this was before
brother Mohamed</i>

<i>become brother Mohamed.</i>

<i>When he was still
breakin' bones</i>

<i>like a fuckin' ogre
in a kids story.</i>

<i>Khalil.
So, he starts shovin' him.</i>

<i>And pushin' him around.</i>

<i>And Brother Mohamed just looks
at him like an ant.</i>

<i>Like less than an ant.</i>

Like a shit that an ant takes
and looks at and is like

"Oh, that's a small-ass piece
of fuckin' shit!"

Whole place stops.

But the Cyclops does somethin'
no one ever saw him do.

He laughed.

<i>He fuckin' laughed.</i>

And this was huge.
Ah, a huge moment.

It was like seeing
your dad cry or somethin'.

<i>Somethin' you never
thought possible.</i>

<i>He never did hit him.</i>

They almost became
kind of friends, you know?

And brothers started passin' him
pages from the Holy Book.

Tellin' him he didn't have
to fight anymore.

To surrender
to the one and only.

And just like that..

...Cyclops was slain.

Made a peaceful warrior
by Allah.

To friends.

Old and new.

It's a day's drive
to the safe house.

Tried to make it comfy for you
back there, but it'll get bumpy.

Shotgun in the back,
if we hit any trouble.

When you cross, these guys will
take you to my connection.

He'll pay 'em out
and set you up somewhere

with an umbrella
in your drink.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Everybody. Stop thankin' me.
Come on.

Giddy-up!

Does he talk that much
all the time?

Hmm!

Yeah. He's kinda got the gift.

Mm-hmm.

I used to have a friend who'd do
that. We called her Chicken.

Why? Chicken?

She was not a chicken.

She used to tell everybody
she was part gypsy.

And she had these teeth
that you could just

see comin' from
a mile away.

She was always mouthin'
off to the cops

and get all us kids in trouble.

Mixin' it up, huh?
Uh-huh.

Then we'd have to fight.
I could fight.

Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

Like you care.

Before they'd lock me up,
I used to worry about nothing.

I never caused
too much trouble.

Just kept to myself.

Just stole a couple cars, and
run 'em till they run outta gas.

Slept wherever.

Before you,
there was nothing.

It was all nothing.

This is it.
Stay frosty.

<i>Welcome to nowhere!</i>

Where nothin' is your business
and nobody got no names.

This is the precious cargo, huh?

<i>You our guy?
I am the guy, amigo mio.</i>

And this is my personal liaison.

He's a bit shy,
as you can tell

but he does know
what he's doin'.

<i>As does
everybody else out here.</i>

Come on.
Let's get you all settled.

<i>You got a long drive, manana.</i>

We got us a live one, huh?

We ain't lookin' for trouble.

Oh, but you were
sizing us up

ever since you got
outta that truck.

Did math on us, too, didn't ya?
How much we weigh?

<i>Can we handle our business?</i>

Look. We just move stuff around
down here, man.

That's all we do.

<i>None of us wanna go back
to a penitentiary</i>

<i>over bullshit.</i>

So why don't we all relax?

And I invite you
to be our guests.

You're good?

We're good.

<i>Country's not really
her genre.</i>

<i>We love those shows
around here.</i>

<i>You see last week
when they did Disco?</i>

<i>Kind of a guilty pleasure.</i>

Judges ate it up.

Even, uh, what's her name?

With the big ol',
uh... with the hair?

You gotta know who you are,
as an artist.

<i>I mean, that's what they're,
they're votin' on</i>

<i>when, when America
looks at 'em.</i>

<i>They wanna know
who that singer is.</i>

Where he or she's been.

<i>I wanna look into
that person's eye and go</i>

<i>"I know your story. "</i>

<i>I can relate.</i>

<i>That's true. I mean,
it's as simple as that.</i>

It's the difference between
a winner and a loser.

Honesty.

<i>We reserved the honeymoon
suite for you all.</i>

<i>Okay. Here's the deal.</i>

Just in case
Osama didn't lay it out for ya

you're gonna stay
with us tonight.

And tomorrow we are
gonna load you into the back

of a truck
that is headed to Juarez.

<i>Where we are going to hand you off
to some other nice folks</i>

<i>that are gonna get you across
to the safe house</i>

<i>and then home
to sunny Caracas.</i>

<i>We got some agua.
There's a working commode.</i>

<i>Hell, you got
all the comforts of home.</i>

<i>See, when everybody plays nice,
everybody gets what they want.</i>

<i>We'll see you in the morning.</i>

<i>You in the blue minivan,

No, no, no, no, no!

And we're goin' opposite directions.
No, no.

You realize, you gotta run as fast as you can.
No, they'll shoot you. No.

<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

They'll shoot you.
I'm not gonna let them take you.

No, they ain't

Don't worry now.

Just two cops. Okay?

Ain't gonna do that.

He's not getting out.
This is your last warning.

Out of the minivan!

Okay.
Okay.

One, two, three.

She's going..

Get out of the van
and get on the ground!

She's my hostage.
I'm lettin' her go.

I stabbed him.

She didn't have
nothin' to do with it.

Get on the fucking ground!

I stabbed him.
What just happened?

I killed him.
It's, it was me.

Look, man. Get on the ground.
Nobody has to die today.

He's got bracelets on, man.

You hear me? Huh?

I surrender.

I surrender to you.
I surrender to you.

I surrender everything to you.

No.
Fuck!

Mohamed!

<i>I can't seem to get used
to that big clunk</i>

<i>when the doors lock up.</i>

<i>And all
the night noise starts.</i>

<i>But there's this
little patch of sky</i>

<i>out my window, and I can see
clouds moving along.</i>

<i>Off to someplace
that isn't here.</i>

<i>Someplace bigger,
where they got more room</i>

<i>to do what they do.</i>

<i>Clouds things, I guess.</i>

<i>When I think of you,
it takes me away from here.</i>

<i>Out past the place where
the clouds get off to.</i>

<i>All I have to do is just think
about your face.</i>

<i>And I'm out in the free world.</i>

<i>Pressing up against the walls
of our little closet.</i>

<i>And we're there, together.</i>

<i>Where things don't
echo all the time.</i>

<i>I think of you.</i>

<i>I think of you.</i>

<i>I think of you.</i>

Hi.
Hi.

Hi.
Hi.

You get my letter?
Yeah.

Even tried to write you
back but.

Just came out wrong.

It's okay.
Hmm.

You should keep
tryin' though.

Is that a new shirt?

Yeah.

I guess I sort of stole
your look, huh?

Are you okay?

You make any friends?
Yeah, some.

You know, there's some good
people here.

I hear the lawyer's gonna
get you a really good deal.

Yeah, Vicky's...
she real smart.

She always smell
like coconut, though.

Aw, you shouldn't be in here.

I took a life, Mohamed.

Wasn't mine to take.

How's our place?

Uh... it's empty again.

Hey, you should get a dog.

I miss you so much.

I miss you, too.

Come on.
Give me your head.

Do you feel my hand?

Yeah.
Yeah?

You feel it?

I do.

You have me.

You didn't before,
but you do now.

I do now.
