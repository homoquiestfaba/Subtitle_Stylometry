Come here, crafty dwarf!
You shall be pitilessly pinched ...

... if you haven't finished
the fine-wrought gold on time

Let me go! lt's ready as ordered

Why are you so slow to show it?
Lest something was lacking

What is not ready?
Here ... and there

Give me the work!

See, scoundrel,
everything finished!

Did the simpleton seek
to deceive ...

... and keep for himself the object
my craft taught him how to forge?

The helmet fits.
Will the spell work too?

''Night and mist, like to no one!''

Can you see me, brother?

Where are you? l cannot see you

Then feel me, rascal! Take that
for your thieving thoughts!

Thank you, stupid!
Your work has stood the test

Nibelungs, bow down to Alberich!

Now he is watching you everywhere
and rest is refused you

Work for him though he is unseen

You are his vassals for ever!

Listen for him, he is near,
the Lord of the Nibelungs

Here is Nibelheim.
What fiery sparks are flashing?

What is that among the rocks?

Why are you whimpering?

Hey, Mime! What torments you so?

Leave me in peace!

More yet, l would help you, Mime!

l must obey my own brother
who brought these bonds on me

What gave him the power
to bind you?

Cunning Alberich wrought himself
a ring from the Rhine's gold

With it he has overcome us,
the Nibelungs' nocturnal race

Carefree smiths, once we created
ornaments for our women ...

... and lightly laughed at our work

This villain compels us to creep
into caverns and toil for him

Through the ring his greed divines
where a new gleam is concealed

We have to dig it out, melt the
booty and forge the cast ...

... to pile up our master's hoard

Your idleness brought on his ire?

On me he forced the heaviest task

He bade me forge and weld a helmet

l noted what power
lay in the work l fashioned

l wanted to keep the helmet
and escape from Alberich's sway ...

... perhaps get him in my power ...

... and snatch the ring so that
l might be free and he my slave!

Why did you not succeed?

Though l fashioned the work ...

... l did not guess
the spell aright

He who planned the work
and snatched it from me ...

... has taught me
what cunning lay in the helmet

He vanished from my sight,
but unseen his arm raised weals

That's what thanks l earned!

Our capture will not be easy
He will fall with your cunning

Who are you, then, strangers?

Friends. We will free the Nibelungs

Beware! Alberich draws near

We'll wait here for him

ldle herd, pile up the hoard!

Put down the treasure!
Must l help?

Who is there?

Here, scamp! Have you
been chattering to these tramps?

Be off, idler! Back to your bench!

Out of here, all of you!
Find me gold from the new veins!

My whip waits
for those that don't dig deep!

l am everywhere
though none can tell where

Are you still lingering?
Still loitering?

Tremble, abject throng!

Obey the master of the ring!

What do you want here?

From Nibelheim's land of night
we have heard new rumours

Mighty marvels Alberich works.
Greed brought us as guests to gorge

Envy led you, that l well know

Do you know me well?
Who am l that you should snarl?

ln your cave Loge smiled on you,
gave light and warming flames ...

... and fired your forge

l am your kinsman, was your friend.
You show little thanks

Loge smiles now with elves of light

lf, false one, you're their friend
as you once were mine ...

... l have nothing to fear

You can have faith in me
ln faithlessness not fidelity

But dauntlessly l defy you all!

Your power lends you assurance

Great has grown your strength

Do you see the hoard heaped up?

l never yet saw one so enviable

That is today's paltry pile.
lt will increase in the future

But Nibelheim is joyless ...

... and treasure can buy nothing

Nibelheim's night serves me
to create and conceal treasure

With the hoard in the cave
l intend to work wonders

l will win the world for my own

How will you start on that?

You who aloft in the breeze
live, laugh and love ...

... all you gods l'll grip
in my golden grasp!

As l renounced love ...

... all shall renounce it!

Allured by gold,
for gold alone shall you hunger

On radiant peaks you live in bliss

The black gnome you despise,
you eternal revellers!

Beware!

When you men serve my might the
dwarf will take his pleasure ...

... with your pretty women,
though love does not smile on him

Did you hear?

Beware when the Nibelung horde ...

... rises from the depths
to the light!

Blasphemous fool!
What?

Keep your head!

Faced with Alberich's work
who would not feel wonder?

lf you win, with your treasure,
all you demand ...

... l must acclaim you
the mightiest

Moon, stars, and radiant sun ...

... can do no other but serve you

But ...

... l deem it significant
that those who heap the hoard ...

... obey you ungrudgingly

Boldly you fingered a ring ...

... before which they trembled

But if a thief by stealth ...

... snatched the ring?

How would you guard yourself?

Loge thinks himself most artful

Others seem stupid to him

That l should need his counsel,
the thief would rejoice to hear

l conceived the concealing helmet
and had Mime fashion it for me

The helmet allows me
to change my shape at will

No one can see me, yet l am
everywhere

l can live safe even from you ...

... kind, considerate friend!

l have seen many strange things,
but never witnessed such a wonder

l cannot credit this unique work

Were this possible,
your power would last for ever

Do you think l lie like Loge?
Until l see for myself

The fool is bursting with wisdom

Now may envy devour you!
ln what shape shall l appear?

Whatever you will

Strike me dumb with astonishment!

Giant serpent, curl and coil!

Oh, do not swallow me!
Spare Loge's life!

Good, you villain! How quickly
the dwarf turned to a dragon!

Do you believe me now?

My trembling testifies to it

Now that l have seen it
l readily believe the marvel

But can you make yourself tiny?

That would be the subtle way
to escape danger

But that would be too hard!

How small shall l be?

So that a crevice might hold you
where a toad timidly hides

Nothing simpler!

Watch me!

Crawl, crooked grey toad!

Seize it quickly!

l am captured!
Hold him till l tie him!

Up we go. There he will be ours

Sit tight there, kinsman!

Look, there lies the world
that you wanted to win

What spot, tell me,
will you allow for my sty?

Rogue! Ruffian! Loosen my
bonds or you'll rue this outrage!

You are caught in my chains

You fancied the world lay
in your power

Wretch, you cannot deny it!

To free you a ransom is demanded

Dolt l am, to trust this trick!
Terrible vengeance l vow!

First you must set yourself free

To a fettered man
no free soul makes amends

lf you relish thoughts of revenge,
first think about the ransom

Say what it is you want
The treasure and your gold

Greedy gang of rogues!

But if l keep the ring
l could spare the treasure

New wealth would soon be won
at the ring's command

l shall not pay too dear
if the lesson costs only baubles

Will you yield the treasure?
Loosen my hand and l'll summon it

l have called the Nibelungs

l hear them hauling
the hoard from the depths

Now loosen my bonds!

Not until all has been paid

Oh humiliation that my slaves
should see me captive!

Bring it in as l command!
Pile the hoard into a heap!

Don't glance over here!
Quick there, quick

Then get back to your labour!

Woe betide if l find you idle!
l am following at your heels

l have paid. Now let me depart

And the helmet that Loge holds,
now kindly give back to me

This belongs to the ransom

Accursed thief!

But patience!

He who made it can make another

Mine is the might that Mime obeys

Yet it's hard to leave
my weapon to my foes

Alberich has left you everything.
Now, bullies, loosen my bonds!

Shall l untie him?

A golden ring rests on your finger

That belongs to the hoard
The ring?

To be freed you must forfeit it
My life, but not the ring!

l require the ring.
With your life do what you will!

l lose limb and life
if l must lose the ring too

Hand and head, eye and ear
are not more my own than this!

You call the ring your own?

Are you raving, shameless gnome?

From whom did you take the gold
from which you made the ring?

Was it your own,
that you stole it from the depths?

Ask the Rhine's daughters ...

... whether they gave you
the gold you robbed

Base trickery! Vile deceit!

Do you throw on me the blame
for what you so dearly desired?

Gladly you would have robbed
the Rhine of its gold ...

... had you so easily
found the way to forge it!

How well it worked for you ...

... that l, in shame and fury ...

... gained the terrible magic
whose work now gladdens you!

Must this fatal, fearful deed ...

... serve you as a royal toy,
my curse serve for your pleasure?

Take heed, haughty god!

lf l sinned it was against myself

But you sin against all that was,
is and shall be ...

... if you seize my ring!

Surrender the ring!

No right to it can you prove

Crushed!

Shattered!

Of wretches the wretchedest slave!

Now l possess what will make me
the mightiest of mighty lords!

ls he to go?

Set him free!

Slink off home! No knot holds you

Am l free?

Truly free?

Then thus l give you
my freedom's first greeting!

Since by curse it came to me,
accursed be this ring!

Since its gold gave me might ...

... may its magic bring death
to whoever wears it!

lt shall gladden no happy man

lts gleam shall light
on no one lucky!

Whoever possesses it
shall be consumed with care ...

... whoever has it not
shall be gnawed with envy!

Each shall itch to possess it,
but none shall find in it pleasure!

lts owner shall guard it
profitlessly

Through it he shall
meet his executioner!

Forfeit to death, faint with fear
shall he be fettered

The length of his life
he shall long to die ...

... the ring's master to
the ring a slave ...

... until again l hold
in my hand what was stolen!

Thus in direst distress ...

... the Nibelung blesses his ring!

Keep it now, guard it well!

My curse you cannot escape!

Did you heed his fond farewell?

Let him give vent to his fury

Fasolt and Fafner are approaching

They are bringing Freia back

They have returned
Welcome, brother!

Do you bring good tidings?

We carried out the task.
There lies what will free Freia

From the giants' grasp
our fair one approaches

The breeze breathes on us again

Bliss fills our senses

lt would be gloomy to be
for ever separated from her ...

... who gives us perpetual youth
and joyous delight!

Dearest sister!
Are you restored to me?

Do not touch her!
She still belongs to us

At Riesenheim's boundary
we stopped to rest

Honourably we tended
the pledge for the pact

l regret l am returning her ...

... for us to be paid her ransom

The ransom lies ready

Now the gold shall be measured

To do without the woman
saddens us sorely

lf she is to be
banished from my mind ...

... the treasure must be so high
that it hides her from my sight!

Freia's form shall be the measure

These poles measure the pledge.
Now fill the space with the hoard

Hurry! The work is repugnant!

Help me, Froh!
l'll end Freia's shame

Not so loosely packed!

Fill the measure tightly!

l can still see through it.
Stop up these chinks!

Stand back, clod!

Keep your hands off!
Close these crevices!

Deep in me burns my disgrace

Our pure one stands humiliated

Her look mutely pleads for release

Wicked man, to ask this
of a loved one!

Still more!

Rage this rogue rouses in me!

You cur! lf you want to measure,
measure yourself against me!

Your din avails you nothing!

Not even to crush you?

Peace!

l think Freia is covered now

The hoard is used up

l still see the gleam of her hair.
Throw that object on the pile!

The helmet too?

Here with it!
Let it go!

Are you satisfied?

Freia the fair l see no more

Must l let her go?

Her gaze still gleams on me here,
through a crack

As long as l see those lovely eyes
l cannot tear myself away!

l advise you, stop up this crack!

Can't you see the gold has gone?

By no means. On Wotan's finger ...

... still glints a ring of gold.
Give it here to fill the crack!

What! This ring?

Listen! This gold belongs
to the Rhinemaidens

Wotan will give it back to them

What idle chatter is this?
What l won l'll keep for myself

lt goes badly with the promise
l gave the lamenting maidens

Your promise does not bind me.
The ring remains with me

But you must yield it here

l will grant you everything ...

... but for all the world
l will not surrender the ring!

Then our first bargain stands.
Freia follows us for ever!

Help!
Give in to them!

Do not hold back!
Give up the ring!

Leave me in peace!
The ring l'll not surrender

Yield, Wotan, yield!

Escape from the ring's curse

To dark destruction ...

... its possession dooms you

Who is this woman who threatens?

l know whatever was

Whatever is, whatever shall be ...

... l also see

The eternal world's first
ancestress ...

... Erda warns you

My womb bore three daughters,
conceived before the start of time

What l see, the Norns
nightly tell you

But direst danger
today brings me in person to you

Hear me!

All that is shall come to an end

A dark day dawns for the gods

l charge you ...

... shun the ring!

Mysterious your words sound

Stay that l may know more!

l have warned you

You know enough

Reflect in fear and dread!

lf l must fear and dread,
l must seize you and learn all!

What would you do, madman?

Desist, Wotan! Touch not
the noble one. Heed her words!

Listen, you giants! Wait!

You shall be given the gold

Dare l hope so?

Do you think me
truly worth this ransom?

Come to me, Freia!

You are freed

Bought back, restore our youth!

You giants, take your ring!

Stop, greedy! Leave some for me.
A fair division will be best

You longed more for the maid than
for gold, lovesick loon!

l persuaded you to exchange her.
You would not have shared Freia ...

... so l retain more for myself

Do you insult me?
l call on you as judges

Divide the treasure between us

Let him take the treasure.
Only keep the ring!

Back! Mine is the ring!
For it l gave up Freia's gaze

Hands away! The ring is mine!

l hold it. lt belongs to me!

Hold it fast in case it falls!

Now blink at Freia's gaze.
The ring you will not touch again!

Terrible now l find the curse

What luck, Wotan! Great your gain
when you won the ring

More it profits now it is taken

See, your foes fell each other
for the gold that you gave up

Yet anxiety weighs upon me

Dread and fear fetter my mind

How to end it Erda must teach me

l must go down to her

Why do you tarry, Wotan?

Does the noble fort not beckon
as it waits to welcome its owner?

l paid for it with unclean wages!

A sultry haze hangs in the air.
lts dull weight oppresses me

l will collect the clouds
in a storm to sweep the sky

Come to me, mists and vapours!
Donner, your master, summons you

As l swing my hammer, hover here!

Misty moisture, hanging haze!

Donner, your master, summons you

Brother, point out the path!

The bridge leads to the fort ...

... light but firm below your feet

Boldly tread its terrorless path!

The sun sheds its evening beams

ln its gleam the castle shines

ln the radiance of the morning
it stood tenantless ...

... grand and inviting before me

From morn to eve, in care
and anxiety ...

... not lightly was it won

Night draws on

From envy it now offers shelter

Thus l salute the fortress ...

... safe from terror and dread

Wife, follow me

Dwell in Valhalla with me!

What means the name?
Never have l heard it before

What my courage found for me

lf it lives on victorious,
it will make its meaning plain

They hasten to their end,
though they think themselves strong

l am almost ashamed
to share their doings

Fancy lures me to transform
myself back into flames

To burn them who tamed me
rather than end with the blind!

lt doesn't seem stupid

l'll think it over

Who knows what l'll do?

Rhinegold! Purest gold!

How bright you once shone on us!

What lamenting assails me here?

Give us the gold!

The children of the Rhine
lament their looted gold

Accursed nymphs!

Give us its glory again!

Stop them annoying us!

You in the water, why wail to us?
Hear what Wotan wills for you

No more gleams the gold on you

Henceforth bask in bliss ...

... in the gods' new radiance!

Rhinegold! lf but your gleam
still glittered in the deep!

Now only in the depths lie
tenderness and truth

False and faint-hearted
are those who revel above!
