NARRATOR:
<i>Hoping to break the spell</i>

<i>that had destroyed her chance
for true love,</i>

<i>Princess Mei Li secretly sailed
from Cathay</i>

<i>to the kingdom
of the Swan Princess.</i>

<i>Indeed, her wish came true,
and the spell was broken.</i>

<i>The tale of how that spell
was first cast</i>

<i>had been too sad
to tell before now.</i>

<i>But it is also a story
that is not over,</i>

<i>as Princess Mei Li will
desperately need</i>

<i>the help of the Swan Princess
once more.</i>

MEI LI:
It's beautiful.

But you are being
far too generous.

Impossible.

I could paint
for a thousand years

and never capture your beauty.

[GASPS, GRUNTS]



[BIRDS CAWING]

[MEI LI GASPS]

You're coming with us!
Take your hands off me!

What are you doing?
Wait! Stop!

I command you...!

Father!


Father, no!

MEI LI:
No!

[MEI LI SOBS]

Chen, I'm so sorry.


Chen!

How could you let her?


ODETTE: I always
wondered how it happened.

MEI LI: It was too painful
to share until now.

ODETTE: Well, thanks to Prince
Li, it's all in the past.

Now you can go home and marry
and be happy forever.

Mei Li?
That's just it.

What if Father still refuses
to let us marry?

What if Fang casts
another spell?

I want to ask a hard thing.

Then, please, ask.

Can we stay here, Chen and I?

Oh, I...
Oh, forgive me.

It is too much to ask.

Well, will you be
truly happy here?

I know if I had to live
so far away from home,

I'd miss it terribly.

I know you are right.

But maybe...

DEREK:
Go home with Mei Li?

We did interfere,
and we should explain why.

Hm. Alise and Lucas are in
Borromeo for the tulip festival.

And if we don't go?

The emperor may not
let them marry.

I always said I'd follow you
to the ends of the earth.

Ends of the earth, heh,

here we come!


I haven't done that
since I was a kid.

[ODETTE LAUGHS]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh! You won the Swan Princess
Music Festival!

Father will be so proud of you.

Thank you.

You really loved her,
didn't you?

Alise will always be
very special to me.

Your sacrifice gave Chen and me
a chance for love.

We will never forget that.
Never.

You are very noble, Li.

Well, I suppose
this is goodbye...

forever!


Mother,
you had a bad dream.

That's all it was.
No. It was a premonition!

You sailed to a faraway place,

and you never returned!

You had a child
named Yippity Skippity.

See, that's how you know
it was a dream, Mother.

So I created
this scrapbook for him,

for my little Yippity Skippity.
Oh.

"All About Uberta."

Oh, so he'll know something
about his poor grandmama.

It's very nice, Mother,
but we'll be back, I promise.


Goodbye!

Don't you know it's bad luck
to say goodbye

to someone getting on a boat?
Nonsense. They'll be safe.

Salt over the shoulder.

Knock on wood.
Ugh, ugh, ugh!

Pinch a frog.
Ugh!

Hey, you made that last one up!


I hope we're doing
the right thing.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[PASSENGERS LAUGHING]

Ru! Please join us!

Now that home is so close,
I have a gift for you.

I love it!

Oh, Ru, you've always been
so kind to me.

It has been
the honor of my life.

Wedding veils must be
very special.

Oh, yes.

I'll wear it
the day we're married.

Then the royal monk will
invite them to kneel.

Then he'll ask me
to lift the veil.

And the very moment
your eyes meet,

you are joined forever.

Oh, I can't wait to see it.

You will...

if Father will let us.

Looks like we'll find out soon.

RU:
Home.

Okay, let's review the plan.

When we get there, Mei Li
and Chen will stay on the yacht.

Below deck. Out of sight.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Divine Emperor, Li has returned.

He flies the flag of victory,

just as my tea leaves predicted.

Your tea leaves were
right again.

Good job, Fang! Hee-hee!

Note to self:

Remind the emperor
of my skills more often.

I give myself an eight
on that one.

No, no, no, 8.5!

Eight point five, for sure!

[CLEARS THROAT]

Your tea leaves have proven
to be of great value.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Divine Emperor.

Your son, Prince Li,
has returned with honor.

Indeed he has.

My son, I am so, so proud.

Thank you, Father.

Ah, and you bring guests.

The Swan Princess, Odette,
and the Crown Prince Derek.

Will you grant a private moment
to the prince and princess?

I would be delighted.

They've requested
a private moment, Fang.

[GROANS SOFTLY]

It is such an honor
to meet you both.

We know your story well.

We are flattered, dear emperor.

The Swan Princess.

And the prince
who could only see her beauty.

Well, yes, but I also defeated
the Great Animal.

So there's that too.

Dear emperor, a gift from us.

Ah, it's beautiful.

It is...?
A poem.

Ah. And the poet?
Well, me.

For better or worse.

[EMPEROR CHUCKLES]

Better, I am sure.

Will you do the kindness
of reciting it for me?

I'd be most honored.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

<i>She is like me
This brave swallow, Mei Li</i>

<i>Just as I once flew</i>

<i>So she winged
Through my window one night</i>

My Mei Li? How?

<i>At first she came by sea
My friend, Mei Li</i>

<i>Ten thousand miles afloat</i>

<i>Stowed away
On her brother's boat</i>

So that's where Mei Li...
You took her in.

You should have
returned her to me.

I have a bad feeling.

We should have stayed.

My father will not be pleased.

<i>And her love did follow
That tiny, brave swallow</i>

<i>Into my room that night</i>

Chen? I must tell Fang!

<i>For the earth holds no ocean
That could keep his devotion</i>

<i>From the swallow
I met that night</i>

[THUNDER RUMBLES]

<i>Mei Li spoke of pain
And worse, a father's anger</i>

<i>And a sorcerer's curse</i>

<i>But she is like me
My friend, Mei Li</i>

<i>An act of devotion
Without compare</i>

<i>Released her love
From the sorcerer's snare</i>

The spell is broken?

<i>'Twas a gift of love from him</i>

<i>No other than her friend</i>

<i>Her brother</i>

<i>Her twin</i>

So where is she? Is she okay?

Fang, you silly dumpling!

You couldn't see
the twin brother

could break the spell too?

You get one measly point
for that, Fang.

Ru, send the signal!

It's not only safe to return,

they shall marry
and live in the palace!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Mei Li and Chen cannot be found.

Oh, no. She lost hope.

Send all guards,
all resources to find her!

She must know how sorry I am.

I'll go with them.

Are you sure you know the way?

My father and I hunted there
many summers.

It's very far,
but no one will ever find us.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Please, ancient ones,
holy ancestors...

find Mei Li.

Bring her home to me.

I used to feel
so close to the ancestors.

But now...

they feel so distant.

I can only assume
they are displeased with me

for allowing the spell
to be cast on Chen.

We're getting close
to the bridge.

Three days from our new home.

[BRANCH CRACKS]
[BIRDS RUSTLING]


MEI LI:
Fang?

Come on.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[FANG CHUCKLES]

Can't have the princess

leaving the kingdom.

[ROPES CREAKING]

MEI LI:
No!

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

Mei Li!

It was you?

Wait.
We're not going back.

No, listen...
Li, just let us go!

Father gives you his blessing.

[BOTH GASP]

Truly?
Truly.

[GIGGLES]
Oh, Mei Li.

We're going to be...
So happy.

No! Married.
Oh, right. But happy too.

Yes! So happy.

[LI SINGS IN CHINESE]

I like that!
Yeah?

It's our victory song.
CHEN: We'll teach you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[SINGS IN CHINESE]

There, you try.

[SINGS IN CHINESE]

[CHEN & LI LAUGH]

When the battle is over,

not when the battle's lost.


[SINGING IN CHINESE]

[SINGS IN CHINESE]

[CHEN & LI LAUGH]

I sang "standing taller,"

not "growing taller."

[BOTH SINGING IN CHINESE]

[SINGS IN CHINESE]

[CHEN & LI LAUGH]

A hero, not a bear!

Let's just sing it in English.

MEN:
â™ª When the battle's over â™ª

â™ª And you're standing
A little taller â™ª

â™ª When the final flag
Has flown â™ª

â™ª Your heart beating
Like a drum... â™ª

Foolish girl!

You would have ruined my plans,
had you escaped.

Say what you've come to say

and be on your way, Fang.

You will never marry Chen.

Why are you so determined
to ruin our happiness? Why?

Because Chen will be mine.

You love Chen?


Yes.

And I will be his wife.

Why would Chen choose you?

I have a better question,
princess.

Why would Chen choose you?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


You will grow weaker each day,

until the moment Chen
lifts the wedding veil

and our eyes meet.

Then you will pass
from this world

to live with the ancestors.


Oh! Perfect fit. It brings
out my eyes, don't you think?

This will never work.

I will tell the Swan Princess!

Tell the whole world!


No one will ever believe you.

As for your beloved
Swan Princess,

I have plans for her too.

You will never feel the love
that Chen and I have.

You are evil,

and our love is pure.


You know what?
You're kind of boring.

And I have a wedding to plan.



That landed bigtime!

Mei Li was like, "What?"
Well done, Fang!

CHEN, LI & DEREK: â™ª ...beating
like a drum To the victory â™ª

â™ª Returning home a hero â™ª

Chen!

[LI & DEREK CHUCKLING]

CHEN: I've never seen you
with flowers in your hair.

It's beautiful.

They bring out your eyes.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

My dream has come true.

Mei Li!

Oh, Father, thank you,
thank you!

You're more beautiful than ever.
You're so kind, Father.


I can't believe we're going
to have our happily ever after!

Thank you, Divine Emperor.

I should be thanking you, after
all that's passed between us.

RU: <i>This mural tells the
story of our ancestors.</i>

<i>Their trials
and their victories.</i>

<i>Their sorrows and their joys.</i>

Seven centuries
are recorded here, princess.

After the wedding,
I hope you will continue

as the royal artist.

I would be honored,
Divine Emperor.

May I restore
the oldest sections of the wall?

You may.

But please start with Mei Li.

That spill haunts me.

Now, where is Fang?
I summoned her a while ago.

Uh, Father?

If you don't mind,

I'm feeling so tired
from all the excitement.

Of course you are.

May I excuse myself to lie down?

Of course.

May I introduce you
to my most ancient ancestors?

ODETTE:
We'd love to meet them.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


What a bunch of chumps!

Not even the Swan Princess
can tell who I am!

It's like taking candy
from a baby.

A really tiny baby
who's nodding off to sleep.

Oh, yes.

Han Fa was surrounded
by his enemies...

Emperor.

Forgive my delay, but I was
studying the tea leaves and...

What is it, Fang?
Bad news, I'm afraid.

The mother of Prince Derek
is gravely ill.

But she was fine when we left.

Oh, I've never known
Fang's tea leaves to be wrong.

But you're certain, Fang?

She lies so weak, saying,
"I am ready to go.

I have such wonderful memories."

Derek shouting,
"Arrange the marriage!"

The day
they brought home little...

Is it Alice?
Alise.

I am so sorry, Prince Derek.

We have to return home.

You will take my yacht.
I insist.

Thank you.


Oh, I love this part.

Queen Uberta giving
a castle tour.

Just darling.

I'm definitely adding this
to my Book of the Month Club.


Your belongings are
all onboard now.

Thank you, Ru.

I will miss you both very much.

MEI LI:
Princess Odette!

You know me?

Believe me!
Believe you?

My apologies, princess.

On your way. Move along now.
No, please!

Please, sir, be gentle.

She's old and weak.
This is none of your concern.

[MEI LI SOBBING]

She said
no one would believe me.

Believe me, Odette.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Still thinking
about the old woman?

"Believe me, Odette."

She said it like she knew me.

And what's strange is,

I felt like I knew her too.

DEREK:
It was strange, I agree.

And that Fang,
she's a little spooky.

Found you!
Aah!

Oh, I scared you?

I've been searching
everywhere.

Turns out oceans are big.

Are we too late? Is Uberta...?

Crazy? Yes.
Wait. What?

She's driving me nuts!

"Go find out what's happening
with Derek and Odette!"

So she's not dying?

Dying? Heavens, no!
I'm the one that's dying.

She's killing me.
That's saying something,

considering I'm already dead.
Fang's tea leaves told us

Uberta was dying.

Go find out how she is. Now! Go!

I see it runs in the family.
Scully...

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[GRUNTING, YELLING]

I've seen warm lemonade
with more kick than that.

Nonsense. Hi-yah!




SCULLY:
She's not only alive,

she's dangerous.

Fang lied.

How did she know
all of those details?

I mean, it's like she...


She stole Uberta's book!

That's how she knew.

Scully, go back

and tell Rogers
and Mother we need help.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[SOBBING SOFTLY]

I broke a nail.
SCULLY: Stop!


Apologies, Highness,

but Derek says you gotta go now.

That's all fine. That's fine.

But are Mei Li and Chen
getting married?

Tell her that's the point.

They won't get married
unless we get some help.

Did the emperor blow up?

The emperor is fine!
Are she and Rogers coming?

What are their wedding colors?

No idea!

Did Derek even ask?

Scully!
I need answers!

Stop! You gotta go now.

Tell them we're on our way.
Wait a second. One last thing.

You can't go as Lord Rogers
and Queen Uberta.

This Fang lady read your book.
She knows all about you.

She knows about me?

Then we have no other choice.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Who are you supposed to be?

What do you mean? I'm your
talent agent, Mr. Pennypacker.

"Turning talent
into gold, 24/7."

Nice.

Because I am Madame LeCroix,

world-famous...

[OFF-KEY VOCALIZING]

Singer? No, Uberta.

Pick something more suited to
your vocal talents, like, uh...

Like a world-renowned mime.

Think of the facial expressions
you can use silently.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Flight to Cathay,
now boarding at the royal pier.

[CLEARS THROAT, THEN GASPS]

Seriously, Uberta,
none of this roleplaying

is necessary until we get there.

"Uberta"?

Who is this Uberta you speak of?


Prepare for takeoff...
UBERTA: Wait.

There's no curtain
between me and them?

Prepare for blastoff!

Isn't there
any in-flight entertainment?

Oh, very well.

I'll provide the entertainment.

JEAN-BOB:
Is it too late for me to jump?

[UBERTA VOCALIZING OFF-KEY]
[FACE MASK STRAP SNAPS]

I should have known
Fang was up to something.

I won't let her
hurt Mei Li again.

Let's go to your father
and tell him what Fang has done.

No, we can't. Not yet.

Come,
I have to show you something.

You're lucky
Fang didn't see you.

She wanders the halls
like a ghost at night.

DEREK: Well,
we didn't exactly take the halls.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's been burning for years?
Centuries.

It's called
the Sorcerer's Flame.

It gives Fang her power.

That's a lot of power
for one person.

Someone in the royal line
can extinguish it,

if the sorcerer were ever to use
his or her power for evil.


Not when I'm done with it.

Surely Fang is
up to something evil.

It is not that simple, princess.

We need absolute proof.

Father will not be the first
ever to extinguish the flame

just because we think
Fang is up to something.

[GRAVEL CRUNCHES]


Oh, come on, Fang!
Pay attention!

Be the stones.

Shh. I have a plan. Come.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Let's see them
figure out this combination.

[SNORES SOFTLY]

Huh?

Who made this mess
in my kitchen?

Did you do this, Woof-Shi, huh?

[GONG FA SUCKING TEETH]

[BELL RINGS]

What?

Oh, no, no, no! Out you go!

I am preparing
the emperor's breakfast.

I must concentrate.
Oh, not so fast.

I asked them to deliver,
Gong Fa.

They grow the best bok choy.

You see?

Ha! I wouldn't feed that
to Woof-Shi!

Hmph. These are royal fingers.

I'll pick my own vegetables,
thank you very much.

Now, part two.

Did you get it?

The key to Fang's lair.

You're so brave, Mei Li.

We have to work together
to stop Fang.

I'll wait here
and keep a lookout for her.

Please. Please be careful.

LI:
Let's go.

If Fang's up to something,

the answer is down there.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[DOOR CREAKS, SLAMS]

Chicka-chicka, Fang-Fang!
Who's on fire?


Fang on fire!

I'll stay here.

If Fang gets past Mei Li,
I'll buy you time. Good luck.

Odette.

DEREK:
"You..."

ODETTE:
"Should not..."

"You should not
have come back"?

[GRUNTS, GROANS]

Derek! Ugh!

DEREK:
Get away, Odette! No!


Li! Oh, no. Li!
No!

[DEREK & ODETTE GROANING]

DEREK:
Odette!

[LI GRUNTING]

ODETTE:
Oh, thank you.

LI: Are you all right?
Yes.

Quickly, before Fang comes.

She knows we're back.
I told you,

she knows everything.

There must be another way

to prove she's up to something.

I don't think there is.

It's the lair or nothing.

But you're not safe here.
You must go.

[HOT-AIR BALLOON RATTLING]

DEREK:
Reinforcements. Ha-ha!

Look, I don't know what
the plan will be, just be ready.

Hey, look, you can buy a statue
of Bigfoot for your garden.

Oh, it's full size, even.

Ladies and gentlemen,
tray tables up,

seat backs
in the full upright positions.

Prepare for landing.

Oh, that was a horrible flight.
And only peanuts the whole way.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

UBERTA:
Hello, everyone.

I have arrived.

Your idol is here.

Your star is here.

Gather round, good people,
gather round!

I'm C.J. Pennypacker,
ladies and gentlemen,

and I'm sure you recognize
the one, the only, the silent...

Madame LeCroix!

World-famous ventriloquist!



He means...

world-famous vocalist.

But mostly ventriloquist.

I won't be a ventriloquist.

When they ask you to perform,

you simply say,
"I left my dummy at home."

If only that were true.

Your autograph, Madame LeCroix,
please!

Your autograph.
Why, yes, of course!

[CHUCKLES, GASPS]

UBERTA: Derek and Odette!
Nice costumes.

Do you like it? It's so me.

We need to talk.
Right away. In private.

Oh, so you want a balloon ride.

Hot-diggity-dog, let's do this!

ODETTE: That's when Jean-Bob,
Speed and Puffin will sneak into the lair.

DEREK:
Okay, from the top.

We use my fame

as an international singing star

to get us into the royal palace.

Right. And then?

Then I'll find Fang

and keep her distracted.
ODETTE: While?

ROGERS:
While we sneak into her lair

and find the proof
we're looking for.

Perfect.

JEAN-BOB:
Point of clarification.

We got a queen,
a genius and two heroes,

but the bird,
the turtle and the frog

are doing
all the dangerous stuff?

Sometimes life's a lazy stroll
through the park

and sometimes it's a scary run
through the jungle, Jean-Bob.

Super comforting. Thanks.

Questions? Suggestions?
UBERTA: Not from me.

I think it's...

â™ª Perfect! â™ª

Allow me to suggest
a little plot twist, Uberta.

A mad doctor has removed
LeCroix's vocal chords.

[WINCES, GROANS]

Look, bub, I've been waiting
to play this role all my life,

and nothing is going to ruin

Madame LeCroix's world tour.

[UBERTA VOCALIZING OFF-KEY]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Chen, Princess Odette
and Prince Derek have returned.

Derek and Odette are back?

Shh, Fang can't know.

They came back because...

Because they think she's
determined to stop our wedding.

This ends now.
No, Chen.

She is too powerful.

Besides, I have
a much better idea.

Let's marry as soon as possible.

Before Fang has time
to ruin anything.

But your father...

I will beg until he agrees.

Heh. Then the sooner,
the better.

I look so real.

I've done my best
to make it feel alive.

I know it's not
what you pictured, Father.

You wanted pageantry and
a thousand guests, didn't you?

Only because you deserve it.

You're so kind, Father.

It's just...

I have nightmares that...
That Fang...

That she'll ruin everything.

That she'll use her power to...

No, I would never allow that.

Recall the wedding invitations?

It's a monumental task, I know.

The invitations have gone out

by a dozen ships
and a hundred horsemen.

I'm sorry, Ru,
but I owe this to Mei Li.

This and much more.

You are a good father,
Divine Emperor.

I wish.

But let's hope there's
enough time to become one.

Checkmate.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm sorry, ma'am,
I've never seen her.


DEREK:
I'm looking for an old woman.

She shouts, "Believe me."

Sorry.

Excuse me, sir?

YU YAN: It's okay.
[GASPS]

Please, let me help you.

Come with me.

Excuse me.

I saw you helping an old woman
at the dock.

I remember you!

You were boarding
the royal yacht that night.

Ha-ha, yes!
Oh, she called you Odette?

Oh, shh.

Please, keep my secret.

You can trust me.
Oh, thank you.

Have you seen her,
the old woman?

Oh, I've looked for her,
but no.

Well, if you do...

Oh, I'll tell her
you're looking for her.

Oh, thank you.
Of course.

My good sir, please tell
the emperor we've arrived.

I'm sorry, you can't just
show up to see the emperor.

Excuse me, big guy. I don't
think you quite understand.

Madame LeCroix's a huge star.

I'm sure she is. Nevertheless...

I will prove it.

[INHALES DEEPLY]

No. No free performances,
remember?

Contract. Contract.


Ow!
Fine. Pay me something.

Anything, I don't care.
A button!

[DOOR OPENS]

LI:
Madame LeCroix?

I can't believe I'm actually
meeting you in person.

Come, I have to introduce you
to my father.

It's okay, captain. I'll take
responsibility for them.

You are not invited
to my performance. Hmph!

On the other side of the world,

everyone knows
about Madame LeCroix.

We would be honored
to hear you sing.

Why, yes, I'd...

But I, Pennypacker,
as her agent, think...

But I, LeCroix, think...
It'll take her hours to warm up.

UBERTA:
Oh, I'm warm already.

But why do you have to sing
when you have so many talents?

Do that thing where you pretend
to be a statue for a long time.

For a long time! Watch this.

[GROANING SOFTLY]

Knocks your socks off, right?
Whoa!

Hello, beautiful.

This is Fang, my sorceress.
A sorceress?

Believe me, I know
the "it" factor when I see it,

and you've got it!

Come on, do your thing.

Show me some magic.
A card trick. Anything.

How about I make you disappear?
Fang!

No, no, I like it!

Behind that feline beauty,
she's got some real...


I'm gonna make you
the world's greatest magician.

Send this clown away.
Do you command me?

Mr. Pennypacker, if you are
interested in Fang's abilities,

she will take you
to see the Sorcerer's Flame.

Hot-diggity-dog!
This'll give us time

to talk about our world tour.

Perhaps you'd like to see
some of our own statues.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

JEAN-BOB:
All clear.

How come they make a little door

inside a big door, anyhow?

Jean-Bob, get in there!


Hm...

[GASPS]
[GROWLS]

Doggy door!



I see, I see.

Now, how come you call
that thing the Sorcerer's Flame?

Because it is
the source of my power.

[FIRE ROARING]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Come on, Speed. Let's go.

GONG FA: Turtle soup.
Aah!

Nothing better.

[GASPS, GROANING]

GONG FA:
Woof-Shi, you missed one.

[SQUAWKS]
[GASPS]


Ah, spicy puffin wings,

the emperor's favorite!

Well, Speed,
it looks like we're dinner.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Now, that's what we call
a money shot.

Glad you're impressed.
Tour's over.

What? Come on, baby,
you call that sorcery?

I thought you'd at least
be able to do

the three classic magic tricks.

Number one, pull a rabbit
out of your hat.

Number two, make somebody float.

Number three,
divide somebody in two.

No! No, no, no, no, no.

Put Mr. Pennypacker down.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



Security breach!


Quick.
Wait, wait, wait.

We've still gotta talk
about your contract!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[JEAN-BOB EXCLAIMS]

[VIDEO GAME-STYLE BEEPING]

[BELLS DINGING]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Listen, I'll tell you what,
I will give you 50 percent

of the international box office.

I will give you 80 percent
of international and domestic.

That's the emperor's... Ugh!

[BARKING]
[GRUNTS]

[ALL YELLING]

Listen to me, Fang. Listen, hey.

I will give you everything.

I'll take nothing!

What do you say?
We got a deal, or we got a deal?

Can't you see it?!

I'm offering you
the entire enchilada here.

This is a super rare,
once-in-a-lifetime...

Oh, no. Where's Fang?

Oh, she ran off that way.

What?

PUFFIN: Well, it looks like
you got us here, Jean-Bob.

[DOOR CREAKING]

JEAN-BOB:
Always the squeak.

How come bad guys
never oil the hin...?


Wait. He might be
playing possum.

I think only possums
play possum.

What if he's got a possum friend

who taught him
all his possum tricks?

A spider with a possum friend?

We got a puffin friend.

Well, enough chitchat.
Now spread out.

Sure. As long as I get to steer
clear of Mr. Spider over there.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Nothing here but spells.

Nothing here but jars full of...

frog legs! Oh!

[GASPS, GROANS]

Hey.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

JEAN-BOB:
Looks like we found it.

GONG FA:
These are not good enough.

Look at this. No. What is this?

Who picked these? No.


I'll pick my own vegetables,

thank you very much.


Try this one.


Huh?
Ah!

Do you recognize me?

It's me, Princess Mei Li.

You used to let me cook
in the kitchen.

Can't you see?

I'm Mei Li!

Yes, yes, you're Mei Li.

Poor dear.



GONG FA:
I'll be back tomorrow.

Let's try down here.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


We found it in Fang's lair.


Fang loves Chen?

Well, this is our proof!
We've gotta get this to Li.

Puffin, tell Li to meet us
at the Moon Bridge.

[MEI LI CRYING]

I'm Mei Li.

Puffin!

Hey!

Hey!

I call these two
my grand ancestors,

famous for their bravery
and wisdom

but mostly for their goodness
as royal parents.

I wish I had their gift.

I'll bet sometimes

they felt unfit as parents too.

But I've found that our children
tend to remember the best in us

and let the rest fade away.

Do you really think so?

Oh, I know so.

Believe me.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


What?
The good news is,

we've got time between now
and the wedding to stop Fang.

The bad news is,

Father has moved up the wedding.
What?

Mei Li wants to get married
right away.

Your father has to extinguish
the Sorcerer's Flame.

Who knows what Fang has planned.

When he sees this,
Father will not hesitate.

JEAN-BOB:
Odette!

There's an old woman
calling your name

in the marketplace.
Let's go.

While I find Father,

keep watch for Fang, okay?

Well, of course.

Oh, why does she have
to be called "Fang"?

Why not just "Tooth"?

GONG FA:
I was shopping in the market,

and this old woman
came up to me,

and she said she was Mei Li.

She was so sincere,
I almost believed her.

But, of course,
she couldn't actually be Mei Li.

Hm. The emperor would want her
well looked after.

I will go and see
if I can find her.

Mei Li and Chen will be
married down there,

not too far
from the Moon Bridge, you see?

Ah, yes.

Such a lovely spot.

I'd like you to be there.

In fact, I'd like you to sing.

Yes!

Take that, Pennypacker.

Odette.

Odette.

I am Mei Li.

Did you say...?

Yes!

I am...


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh, poor dear. How can I help?


Allow me, princess.

Is this the woman
who insists she's you?

So you've heard of her too.

My heart breaks for her.

Please, take her
to the royal cottage, Ru,

and see that she's looked after.

I'm so glad you're both safe.

That was sure strange.

You're telling me.

Thank you, miss.


YU YAN:
That's her.

[FANG LAUGHING]

Oh, Fang, you are so good!

They have no idea
who the old woman is. Zip!


The old woman is Mei Li.
Come on.

Oh, come on, Fang!
What's the rule?

Look both ways before changing.
It's a simple rule.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I can't blame you
for wanting to be Mei Li.

She's the most wonderful person
I've ever known.

I was her tutor.

Like a second father to her.

At least, that's how
she made me feel.

She and Chen were
under a spell, you know.

I can tell you.

I was there
when the spell was broken.

She was so brave.

So brave.

So if someone tells me

you're mad
for believing you're Mei Li,

I will tell them, "No, that
woman is the most sane among us

because everyone should wish
to be Mei Li."

Excuse me? Sir.

The woman you brought here,

may I help take care of her?

You know her?

We met just once.

She seemed so sad.

I'm sure she could use a friend.

The cook will give you

everything you need
to care for her.

Oh, thank you, kind sir.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I told you,
you shouldn't have come back.

We know what you've done.

Oh, dear, they know
what I've done!

And we know why.

Chen belongs to Mei Li.

I am...

sweet, innocent Mei Li.


You will not get Chen!

Too late.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What is this place?

This can't be good.

Ru! Help us!
Ru!

Ru, stop!
Can you hear...?

Please, help us!
Help!

Help us, Ru!
Help!

He can't hear us.

What is this place?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Poor daring heroes.

So used to coming to the rescue.

But the moment Chen lifts
my veil and our eyes meet,

we will be married
and Mei Li will die.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[SQUEALS EXCITEDLY]

Now, that's a 10, Fang!

A 10 all the way!

Chicka-chicka, Fang-Fang!


Father!

Father!

I shall prepare
a very special number.

I know you will, Madame LeCroix.

Father, there you are.
What is it, son?

What?

No!

ODETTE:
Derek.

Revered ancestors,

a horrible decision stands
before me.

I need the wisdom
only you can provide.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You seem troubled, Father.

Can I help?

You are so much
like your sweet mother.

I don't need the ancestors
to tell me what to do.

No sorcerer is more important
to me than you are.

I won't allow Fang
to destroy your happiness.

The Flame!

ODETTE:
Oh, she's so cruel.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


FANG: No!
Huh?

Please don't.
You lied to me!

To think how you made
my daughter suffer

for your own selfish desires!

How you made
this whole kingdom suffer!

I have done wrong,
Divine Emperor.

But for the sake
of the ancestors...

Speak not of the ancestors!
But I must.

For all the ancestors
who have passed

and all who will come,

you must not
extinguish the Flame.

You leave me no choice!

FANG:
There is a choice.

I will go away, never to return.

That will be my punishment.

You will never see me again,
I promise.

If you do return,

you will forfeit your life.

Your judgment is just,

Divine Emperor.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



I never could have
planned this better myself.

Fang is no more.

Never to be seen again.

I will now and forever be...

Mei Li.


Careful, girl,
that's a Fang laugh.

[GIGGLES, SIGHS]

Much better.

Yes?

I just passed Fang.
She was running from the castle.

She said
she was never to return.

I don't know
what you did, Father,

but thank you, thank you!

Now you can marry without fear.

Oh, Li!

I am so, so happy
for you, Mei Li.

Almost ready.

You know, your soup is the only
thing I can get her to eat.

I am so pleased. The poor thing.

You are so kind
to take care of her.

Come back as often as you must.

Oh!
Oops, I'm sorry.

Oh, no.
No, I am sorry, royal prince.

Just "Li" will do.

Hm, Li.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh. Um, uh...

Where's Ru? He asked me
to meet him here.

Wha...? I haven't seen him.
Really?

Ah, matchmaker.

I have no idea
what you're talking about.


[PLAYING MARCHING TUNE]

Mei Li has always been
my favorite.

Yes.

I'm sad for anyone who doesn't
get to see this moment.

Excuse me.

Your mother was so looking
forward to this day.

You are such a beautiful bride.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

The wedding song is sacred,

for it speaks of a love
that is honest and true.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Please, Father,
must we have this song?

Oh, you'll love it.

I'm sure it will be beautiful.



â™ª Your love comes to rescue me
Just in time â™ª

â™ª Giving all, you reach me
Just in time â™ª

â™ª Everything
All I could do or love or sing â™ª

â™ª Now makes
A new forever dream â™ª

â™ª For us â™ª

â™ª My heart will always beat â™ª

â™ª The sun will always shine â™ª

â™ª You'll always save me â™ª

â™ª Just in time â™ª

CHEN: â™ª Like the moon
Just after dawn â™ª

â™ª I still see it so clear â™ª

â™ª Your beauty lives on â™ª

â™ª And I am here â™ª



â™ª I am here, Mei Li â™ª

â™ª I'm here â™ª

â™ª And if now it's time to go â™ª

â™ª I am always â™ª

â™ª Forever with you â™ª

â™ª Forever here â™ª

â™ª With you â™ª

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

UBERTA:
â™ª You are here just in time â™ª

â™ª Always here just in time â™ª
Mother?!

Your eyes will see
one last beautiful thing.

UBERTA:
<i>â™ª You are here just in time â™ª</i>

â™ª Each and every moment
Brings new love â™ª

â™ª Forever and always â™ª

â™ª You save me â™ª

â™ª In time â™ª

Oh, no.


I'm doing the lip thing.

Princess Mei Li.

Chen.

You may kneel.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Chen, you may now lift the veil.

DEREK:
Stop!

Don't lift her veil. It's Fang!

No, you're mistaken, princess.
Fang is banished.

How can you do something
so horrible?

Father, don't let them
ruin everything.

Please send them away.
Explain yourselves!

Fang used her powers
to change herself into Mei Li.

Wait a second!
Are you telling me

I sang for an imposter?

What is this treachery?
Deceit and disguises.

Take them all away.

Please, give us a chance
to prove it.

Because if Chen lifts that veil,

Mei Li will die.

Are you saying
I don't know my own daughter?

Dear Emperor, please!


This is Mei Li.

This is your beautiful daughter.

Forgive me, Divine Emperor,

but I believe
the Swan Princess may be right.


Please, Father,
don't believe them.


Wait. I know what's happening.

The old woman is Fang.

She's trying to turn
my friends against me.

Please, I cannot bear it.
Please!

Ru, give her to the guards.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I believe you.

[GASPS LOUDLY]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Father.

Mei Li?

I knew you'd believe me.
Thank you, princess.

You?

Yes. I did it for us, Chen.

Surely you understand.

I did it for us, darling.

What are you talking about?
There is no "us."

I'm so sorry.
So sorry I couldn't tell.

Well, now that you all
know my secret...

Seize her!
FANG: Careful. Sharp objects.

I command you to stop!


You are commanding me?

I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

I knew I should've
taken away your power.

Yup. That's gonna cost you.
Bye-bye.

The choice to do evil
is yours alone.

Oh, that would make
a great motivational poster.

Mm, I can see that.

On the other hand,
I've got plenty of motivation.

â™ª And one and two
And away he flew! â™ª

Derek!

This is what I get
for nailing the song?

What...? What is this place?!

Hello? Chen, are you there?

I don't want you
to miss the ending. Mm.


[LOCKS CLICKING]

What?

Northwest, southwest,
south, northeast.

Huh? I know that's right.

Fang.


FANG: Oh, Ru,
don't you ever get tired of meddling?

Watch this.


So that's what
all the Fang talk was about.


FANG: Oh,
you want to play snake and mouse!

Derek, we have to do something.

Dear emperor?

Ancestors, save my children
and these good people.

And the frog.

[GRUNTS, SIGHS]

What else can I do?

Where there are pure hearts
and good works,

there is always hope.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh, thank you.

[GEARS RATTLING]

No!

FANG:
Oh, such great fun!

Round and round the garden,
like a slimy snake.

One smash!

Two smash!

Time for a princess bake.

Fangs and fire? Seriously?

Ugh, this is all my fault!


Psst, I'll distract her.

Get ready to run.

No, princess.
I can't let you do this.

Huh?

Oh, thank you.

I've got an idea.

[FANG LAUGHING]

Oh, where are you,
my little mouse?

Fang.

Perfect! A twofer.

MEI LI:
I'm the one you really want.

Mei Li.
Go ahead, do your evil.

When I say "now," pull.

No, Odette!

Now!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Were we in time?
I don't know. Come on.

They're all... gone!

Oh, no.

Master Li?
Ru!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MEI LI SOBS]

Oh, Odette.

She saved me.

[MEI LI SOBS, SNIFFLES]

DEREK:
Odette...

Odette.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

All hail the Swan Princess.

Yes.

Hail to the Swan Princess.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It takes more than fangs
and fire to defeat true love.


Sounds like a line
someone else would say.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[SNIFFLES, CRYING]

Remember, dignity.

We will never forget what
you have done for this kingdom.

As my father has spoken.

As my father...


You're the best friend
I've ever had.

I will miss you, my friend.

[EMPEROR CHUCKLING]

Ah, times have
certainly changed, Ru.

My daughter has married
a common artist,

and here I am,
eating in the kitchen.


Indeed they have,
Divine Emperor.

But I think I've taken
all the change I can.

From now on, Ru,
we go back to the old ways.

Really?

[LI & YU YAN LAUGHING]

That is so funny.

[BOTH GASP]

Father! You're in the kitchen?

Let's go.

[YU YAN GIGGLING]

Hm, did you know about this, Ru?

The times are certainly
changing, Divine Emperor.
