[young boy chuckling] Not again.

No, I really see something this time.
You have to believe me.


It's just fire.

There's nothing there.
Hmm.

Maybe you're right.


Good evening, Grandma.
Good evening, Grandma.

Mom, I have to get my smock!
We're inventing!

Professor Jangle, you promised
you'd look at my invention.

[Jeronicus] It's getting there.
No, no, no, Professor, just two minutes?

Oh, did you calibrate the gyroscopic
stabilization system like we discussed?

Not yet, but...
Realign the gimbals?

No, but...
Do that. I'll look at it tomorrow.

Hey, but, Professor...
[Jeronicus] And man the shop, my boy!

Brilliance beckons. Genius awaits!

Yes! [chuckles]

Now.

Now!

{\an8}[chugging]

{\an8}Oh, it's working! It's working!

It is an honor for you to finally meet me.


You?
I'm Jeronicus.

[Don Juan] Mmm.
And thisâ€¦

[Don Juan] Oh.
This is my wonderful family.

[Don Juan] Ah!

<i>Â¡QuÃ© bella, mi reina!</i> [kisses]


<i>Â¡Cuidado! Â¡Cuidado!</i>

I am fragile.
I got you.

<i>Mucho mejor.</i>

You can throw roses at my feet later.

Ah.

I like when people stare at me.

I give them something
to stare at in the form of a dance.


Everything I promised youâ€¦
[Don Juan] And bow!

â€¦will be ours now.

I believe in you, Jeronicus.

Hello, hello?
Magical toy just came to life!

Focus!

Focus.

I believe in you the most.
[Joanne chuckles] Aw.

[Don Juan]Â <i>Â¡QuÃ© dulce!</i>

And I believe in you.

That's whyâ€¦

I got youâ€¦ an early Christmas gift.

[warm music plays]


They're perfect!


I am, Daddy, just like you.


Okay, back to me.

Oh, Professor! You did it.
[sniffs]

Ooh! Ugh!

<i>Â¡Ay, Dios mÃ­o!</i>

But how?
You are very stinky. [grunts]


Por favor.

Admire me from a distance.

Soon, there'll be a million of 'em.

Huh?

A million of me?

One for every child in the world.

<i>Uno, dos, tresâ€¦</i>

Uhâ€¦ But, but...

I am one of a kind!

We have to celebrate.
Let me get dinner ready.

Celebrate what?
Yes, indeed.

Wait, wait. Excuse me!

Wonderful family!

Gustafson, straighten up everythingâ€¦
Uh-huh.

Ehâ€¦ <i>Â¿Profesor?</i> Yoo-hoo!
[Gustafson] Professor J, could you...

Good? No.


A million of me?

Who could conceive such a thing?

This is absurd.

I am singular. I am spectacular!

To pull off such a feat, he would needâ€¦

"Plans for Don Juan Doll."



<i>Â¡No, no, no! Â¡No puedo!</i>

[Don Juan] Hmm.


[groans softly]

Mmm.

It must feel good
to be such an integral part

of bringing something so amazing to life.

It was, umâ€¦

Well, the professor's work really.

I'm just his apprentice.

<i>SÃ­, peroâ€¦</i>

I am sure you've created
something of your own

almost as amazing as me.

After all,

you're an inventor, too.

I've been telling everyone
just a few tweaks is all it needs.

The professor promised
to look at it tomorrow.

The bull waits for tomorrow!

But by then, he is dead.

We wait for no tomorrows.

Something to look at!


Hmm! Ah-ha!

That book of inventions can belong to us.

Those are the professor's inventions.

[Don Juan] Those are your inventions.

Those pages bear
the sweat of your fingers.

They are as much yours as they are his.

But that would be stealing.

Borrowing.

Indefinitely.

Together,

we can build an empire.

And the name Gustafson will shine brighter
than a thousand Spanish skies.

And I,

Don Juan Diego,

will remain one and only one of a kind.

Gustafson!

Gustafson.

[breath trembling]

[young girl] <i>Oh, no!</i>

Is he coming back?

Unfortunately not.

Jeronicus tried to convince
the constables of what Gustafson had done,

but he had no proof.

And so,

Jeronicus, ever the optimist,
returned to what he knew best.

<i>Only, things weren't quite the same.</i>

<i>He couldn't seem to find

<i>And Jessica, too small.</i>

<i>Eventually, it became clear.</i>

<i>She hadn't lost just one parentâ€¦</i>

<i>But two.</i>

<i>Broken, defeated, Jeronicus insisted
she'd be better off without him.</i>

<i>And finallyâ€¦</i>

<i>She granted his wish.</i>

<i>And Jangles and Things,</i>

<i>once a world of wishes and wonder,</i>

<i>And Jeronicus Jangle,</i>

<i>the greatest inventor of all,</i>

The cuckoo inside just doesn't cuckoo.
[Jeronicus] Mm-hmm.

It's a bit of a family heirloom.


Do you have family?




I'm okay.

I swept the shop,

wiped down the countersâ€¦

And mopped the floor.

Did you clean the pantry?

Ugh!

It would mean a lot if you could fix it.

Of course he can fix it.
I mean, he's the greatest inventor of all.

Children. Active imaginations.

Hmm?

Who's not really a pawnbroker.

Who wants everyone to believe he is.

You're the cutest thing.

Huh?

Hello, Jerry.

It's Jeronicus.

It's Jerry.

A gift.

Expressing my affection.

In the most respectful way I know how.

Would you mind expressing it

Anything for you, Jerry.

Your cousin is visiting for the Holidays.
Merry Christmas.

Hopefully my favorite cousin.

Nope.

Jangle...
Just the person I've been waiting for.

Yes, which is why
you haven't answered any of my inquiries.

Yes, I've been thinking.

Jangle, for the last 30 years,

you've been promising
something sensational.

Yes, and I have a thought.
Yes, something spectacular. Hmm?

Silver.
[sighs]

You melt it down. It's a 3.5,
but it'll be a 4.5 next year.

Something stupendous.
It'll be 5.7 the year after that.

Something that will show the bank
they've made a return on their investment.

Which is why I needed more time.
I can show you.

We're moving...
I'm sorry.

The bank can't wait any longer.
Just take a look...

You'll see yourself.
Listen to me!

Either come up with the money
you've borrowed by Christmasâ€¦

That's just days away.

â€¦or show me the revolutionary invention
you once promised.

Something revolutionary?

[loud thud]

Take the circumference of spectacular.
[clanking]

Divided by
the second derivative of sensationalâ€¦

It'll take approximatelyâ€¦


Two thousand years.

It's a big miscalibration on my part.

The invention or the bank will seizeâ€¦
Wait, wait.

â€¦Jangles and Things and all its assets.
Mr. Delacroix! Mr. Delacroix!

I would lose everything.

I'm sorry to say it, old friend,

but it looks like you already have.

<i>Someone </i>was missing.

<i>And though she had moved far away,</i>

He's right over there.
Thank you.

Are you Mr. Jangle?

Depends on who's asking.

I'm Journey, your granddaughter.

My granddaughter's name is Jackie.
Something with a "U." Justice?

Jupiter? June? July?

It's Journey.

That's a J-O-U. That's with a U. Okay.

My mom told me to give this to you.

"Illumination ignites the integration.
N times betweenâ€¦"

I see.

"Dear Fatherâ€¦"

Allegedly.

Uh, I'd like, uh, one egg, please.

"I've decided to let Journey
stay with you until Christmas."

Journey. Interesting name.

"She's an inquisitive girl,
but well-mannered."

"Like you said, it's time
you both got to know each other."

Did I say that?

When did I say that?

"I'll be there
to pick her up on Christmas morning."

"I hope you are well. Love, Jessica."

No.

My real granddaughter
would never wanna visit me anyway.

But I have nowhere to stay.

Speak quieter,
I'm having a hard time hearing you.

I have nowhere to stay...

You can't stay here. Not now.
Maybe next year, or year after.

Maybe five or ten years from now.

You know what they say about children?

They're a creative vacuum.

I can't have that right now.
I'm workin' on something.

But...
Goodbye.

when we talked outside?

She wanted
her own pair of inventor goggles.

"I want a purple band, Daddy."

"They have to have a purple band."

That's what I did.

Her mother thought
she wasn't ready for it, butâ€¦

I knew that she was.

You can stay.

Great.

Okay, sign it right here.

The pen is out of ink.

Keep going. The pen is full of ink.

You signed it.

You're under contract.


What's this?

[toreador music playing]

Well, maybe next time
someone will lose an eye.

So they'll never have to see
what a mockery you've become.

If you hadn't forced me
to burn your designs,

I could have mass produced you.

an empire would have fallen upon whom?

I am, and forever will remain,

one and only one of a kind.

I will fix it. You'll see.

Or I will come up
with something even better.

You wanna know why?
Because I'm the Toy Maker of the Year,

Toy Maker of the Year, Toy Makerâ€¦
[muttering mockingly]

â€¦Toy Maker of the Year!

Lift me!

Do not be afraid.

I want to offerâ€¦ [kisses]

â€¦sweet words of encouragement.

to not be an imbecile!

Your only successes have come
from that book of inventions.

So why not borrow
another one of Jeronicus's inventions?

Because I have already stolenâ€¦
Borrowed.

â€¦everything in that book.

There is nothing left of him.

There is nothing left
in that pawn shop of his.

Do I need to slap you again?

Because I'm happy to do it, huh? Truly.

Once a great inventor,
always a great inventor.

There is always something left.

[Journey] So what are you working on?
[Jeronicus] Couldn't be someone talking,

the only person talking couldn't,
because they're so busy

doing their chores.

But Grandpa, I don't want to...
Talking.

I was just trying to say...
Chores.

[clocks chiming]

Hmm.

You have to raise the variable
exponentially to the second power.


No, that's not possib...

Square root. Derivative would beâ€¦

You understand this?

What aboutâ€¦?

This one?

The circumference of spectacular.

And this? This one?

The second derivative of sensational.

You looked through my notes.

Hey, hey, hey, watch.

Wait till I'm finished.

You're not gonna trick me on this one.

What about this?

That's what I thought.

It's okay.

Well,

it would be
the square root of possible,

but there's a miscalculation.

<i>The square root of possible
is the summation from one to infinityâ€¦</i>

<i>Multiplied by the integer
from zero to possibleâ€¦</i>

<i>Delta-T times the log of circumference,
times one minus theta raisedâ€¦</i>

<i>Derivative ofâ€¦</i>

<i>Divided by sin-theta.</i>

<i>From zero to one. Multiplied by
the derivative of theta divided by</i>

<i>the interval from one to zeroâ€¦</i>

Now it should work.

You can see that?

Can't you?

No.

Not anymore.

I was just...
No more talking.

Just chores.
But, Grandpaâ€¦

Chores. Chores.

[elevator chugging]

I knew it!

[metallic squeaking]

Ah! Ghost!


Who are you?
Who are you?

I'm Journey. Jeronicus's granddaughter.

I'm Edison. Edison Latimer.

Professor Jangle's most trusted assistant.

You wanna be my apprentice?

Do you wanna be mine?

I asked first.


As the head inventor,
I insist we leave at once.

Not until I find what I'm looking for.
What are you looking for?

I'll know it when I see it.

You shouldn't be touching
anything in here,

it could do something like...

[loud thud]

â€¦that.

[floorboards creaking]

[wind whistling]

[mysterious music plays]

There is something here.

Why didn't the professor tell me?

It'sâ€¦ it's amazing!

It'll be even more amazing
when I get it to work.

If the professor couldn't get it to work,
what makes you think you can?

Because there's nothing that says I can't.




[warm music plays]

There's something's wrong with it.

There'd be something wrong with you ifÂ you
were stuck in a dark room all your life.

It looks like the power source is in

a superposition of states.

We just need something
to collapse the wave function.

[Edison] Will it work or not?
[chittering]

[Journey chuckles] Yes.

What are you saying yes to?
Will it work or not?

It's a simple question.
All I request a simple answer.


At least, I believe it will.

Easy.


My name is Journey.



And this is Edison.

[thuds]
Ow!

I'm okay.


Hi!


Why didn't you work for my grandfather?


<i>Just needed someone to believe.</i>


That's it.


Belief! It collapsed the wave function.

It must have been part
of Grandpa J's formula.

It works.

[Buddy whirring]

Because we believe.

Of course we believe.
He's hovering above your head.

He's hovering above your head!

Mommy!

Whoa!
[Journey] Whoa!

[whimsical music climaxes]


[Don Juan giggles] Bingo!




[Jeronicus] What are you doing up here?
[Edison coughs]

What have you done?

I told her not to touch it,
but she's not a very good listener.

The contract clearly stated
you were not to touch, move,

bust, break or take
anything from this shop!

Do you remember?
I didn't move it.

You expect me to believe
it got up and walked over here?

Well, actually,

he flew.

That's not possible.

Watch. I'll show you.

Like this.

You see?

You see? I told you. It doesn't work.

He does. You just have to believe.

Professor,

you really are
the greatest inventor of all.

I'm not an inventor.

And you're not an inventor either.

[Edison sighs]

But, Grandpa...

Enough already, okay?

Enough.

Nothing would make me happier

than if this worked.

He does. You have to believe me.

I'm telling you the truth.
I would not lie to you, Grandpa.

I need youâ€¦
Please!

I need youâ€¦ to go to bed.
I don't want to go to bed.

I want to stay up here
and fix this, please!

Please!
Good night.

All you have to do...
Listen to me!

Go!

[Jeronicus] No!
[screaming]

[both screaming]



Are you all right, Edison?

Are you okay?
I'm okay.

Journey! Edison!

Are you all right? Are you okay?
Grandpa J!


Grandpa J, your formula, it works.


a steering mechanism made out of rope

that got us through the tunnel alive.

Well done, Edison.

Quite the inventor.

Just like you.

Well, if hugs are going for freeâ€¦

I wouldn't say no.

Mrs. Johnston?

You came back!

A good postal woman
always ensures a safe delivery.

Children, Jerry, come on!

I'll get the truck, you get the crate!


[menacing march music playing]

need you to keep to the left of the road!

Left is good. Right is bad.
[Ms. Johnston laughing]

"It's a failed invention."

"Let them have it."

[huffs and yells]

[Jeronicus] Get outta the way!
[honking]

If you value life, get out of the way!

We're here. You can stop now.

[Ms. Johnston whoops]


Here we go.
[Journey sighs] Yes.


Watch your step. One more.
[Ms. Johnston] Okay.

Thank you, Jerry. Okay.
[Journey] Here we go.

[Edison's mother]
Edison, it's time to come home!

Edison, come on,
we're about to put Buddy together.

My mom is calling me, soâ€¦

I've got to go.

Thanks for helping me rescue Buddy.

I couldn't have done it without you.

We both know that's not the case, butâ€¦

Thanks for saying it anyway.


Journey, I really,
really do like youâ€¦ a lot.

Bye!


Ow! I'm okay!

[Journey sighs]

Buddy.

[warm music plays]

Thank you.

I don't know why you came back.

[chuckles softly]
Because you're a good man.

Stubborn. Ornery.


Could benefit from a good haircut,
a new set of clothes, butâ€¦

Still good.

Jeronicusâ€¦

I know about losing things.

But the magic
isn't just in what you've lost.

It's in what you still have.

Mrs. Johnston?
[engine starts]

<i>Ms.</i> Johnstonâ€¦

[engine idling]

Oh.

Look what I found here.

I forget how you use these.


It's been so long.

I think youâ€¦

Place it over someone's head.

[chuckles softly]
Like so.

And lean in for a kiss.


Like so.

Uhâ€¦

Ms. Johnston?

Ms. Johnston, can you hear me?

["Miles and Miles (Reprise)" playing]
[vocalizing]

[continues vocalizing]

Meow.
Okay.

<i>â™ª I'm smilin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm smilin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Every tooth in my mouth is smilin' â™ª</i>



<i>â™ª You'll feel better when you smile â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Smile â™ª</i>

They really are a group.

[Journey gasps]
[clocks chiming]


Grandpa, you have to fix Buddy.

You have to make him work again.

Please.

[footsteps approaching]

I can't.

Yes, you can.

You're the greatest inventor of all.

You can do anything.

It's why I came here.

I had to see it for myself.

You're here becauseÂ your mother
wanted you here.

That's what she wrote in her letter.

Because I wrote her one from you
saying the same thing.

Why would you do such a thing?

All she ever talked about
was how magical this place was,

and that you could see things
that nobody else could.

Like I can.

Everywhere I've ever been,

I felt out of place.

This is the only place

where I've ever been
where I finally felt like I belong.

Journeyâ€¦

A child with an imaginationâ€¦

Always belongs.

Never be afraid
when people can't see what you see.

Only be afraidâ€¦ if you no longer see it.

Okay?

I love you, Grandpa J.

["Make it Work Again" playing]

[clock chiming]

[parts rattling]

Daddyâ€¦

[tool clatters]

Jessica?

I thought I'd come
to pick Journey up early.

I hope she hasn't been
too much of a bother.

It was nice of you
to even wanna spend time with her at all.

Actually, I never...

Never could have imagined

she'd be such a delight. [chuckles]

Andâ€¦ and she's quite the inventor.

[chuckles softly]

She must have gotten that from you.

Or you.


We should leave now,
if we're to make it by morning.

Jessica, I'm sorry.

For what?

For giving up?

For making me feel it was my fault
that things turned out the way they did?

Do you know how many times
I went to my mailbox

hoping for somethingâ€¦

To let me know that you still cared?
That you even thought about me at all?

I thought about youâ€¦

Every day.

[Jessica scoffs]

Every day.

[warm music plays]

Given everything that happened,

I wasn't sure you wanted to hear from me.

So, I didn't send these letters.

"I wanted you to have the world."

"Reach into the heavens,

pull down the stars
just so they could shine on you."

"Not just read about a happily ever after,

I wanted to be the one to give it to you,

Jeronicus Jangle,
the greatest inventor of all,

only wishes he wereâ€¦"

"The greatest father of all."

Journey reminds me so much of youâ€¦

And your mother.

I wanna be there for her

like I should have been there for you.

I meanâ€¦

Maybeâ€¦

<i>â™ª Maybe I could hold you tight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Until your life is full of love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Maybe I'll explain how light refracts â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And rainbows float above â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And maybe if you ask â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll tell you how I found my smile â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Seeing you has made me â™ª</i>

Smile. [chuckles softly]

I'm sorry.

I love you so much.

I love you, too, Daddy.

[delicate warm music plays]


I'm gonnaâ€¦

I'm gonna go wake up Journey,

if you don't mind.

Say our so longs and goodbyes.

If she's asleep, we could stay.

Or maybe takeâ€¦ take a morning train.

Orâ€¦

Maybe we could spend Christmas here?

If it's all right with you.

That will be... It'll be all right with me.




Is thatâ€¦?

Wow!

The Buddy 3000.
It's really him.

What's left of him.

I was hoping to
put it back together for Journey.

She's taken quite a liking to him.

If we start now, maybeâ€¦

Maybe we could put it together by morning.

[warm music continues]

Symmetry and synchronicity.

Which is the stability of it all.

[Jeronicus] You've been reading my notes.
I think you've been reading <i>my</i> notes.


So good to have you back.

I'm gonna need somethingâ€¦

[warm music rising]


[crowd chattering]

I forgot about that.

[tool hissing]

Got it?
Got it.

[Jessica mumbles]

Hey!
[laughing]

Grandpa J, Iâ€¦

Mommy.


[Jeronicus] Had a little help.
Mommyâ€¦

Hello, baby.

Had a lot of help.

From both of ya.

[all chuckling]

Now, all we have to do is turn Buddy on.

[Journey sighs]

Okay.

I believe.

Come on. Come on, Buddy.

Iâ€¦ believe.

[powering up]


<i>Just needed someone to believe.</i>

Buddy?


You're alive.


Good to see you, Buddy.

[Buddy laughing]

[warm uplifting music playing]

I'm glad you're here.


[loud knocking]


Gustafson?

Well, hello, young lady.

What is the meaning of this?
Please!

The robot that you stole from me.

To the dungeon with him!

Yes, you.
I demand that you arrest him at once.

Right now.
For what?

You're the real thief.

A thief couldn't have these.

The designs
for the robot that I slaved over.

Restless days and sleepless nights.

I wanted to give up
so many times, but I didn't.

Iâ€¦
[Don Juan] We.

â€¦persevered knowing that one day,

Iâ€¦
We.

â€¦would realize my dream.

Proof in black and white.

And blue.

<i>Â¿Azul?</i>

"Property of Jeronicus Jangle."

Explain this at once.

I don'tâ€¦ Iâ€¦

It's an easy explanation...
I can explain.

After I ran into Mr. Gustafson,

I was afraid he would try
to steal The Buddy 3000,

so I marked the design.

For proof.

Uh-oh.

Just arrest Mr. Jangle.

You told me those were your inventions.

Did you lie?

Are you a thief?

Yes, you.

Jeronicus, save me!


He's my invention after all.

I am home!

What?
[Don Juan]Â <i>Mi reyâ€¦</i>

I've missed you!

I like your hair.
Did you do that yourself?

Finallyâ€¦

Children everywhere will love you.
[Don Juan] I am extremely lovable.

Baby kitten eyes.

After I reprogram you.
Reprogram? Reprogram what?

I am and forever will remain
one and only one of a kind!

[powering down]

Come on.

Why are you here, sir?

This doesn't make sense.

You will take the word
of a ten-year-old child?

I'm a respected member of the community!
Are you kidding?

Look at that child!

She has evil in her eyes! Don't you see?

How did you get on the force?

You know...
[Jeronicus] Wait.

I have something for him.

I had it for you that night.
[Gustafson] What?

But then you were gone.

[paper rustling]

A gyroscopic stabilizer.

For yourÂ Twirly Whirly.

I would have shown you everythingâ€¦

If only you'd waited.

Iâ€¦

Come on. Move.


Mr. Delacroix.

Merry Christmas, old friend. Ladies.

I'm sorry it's come to this.

[whirring and whistling]


It's something sensational.

Yes!
It's something spectacular!

More than that!


It's The Buddy 3000.
The Budâ€¦ The what?

[Buddy exclaims]

[Jessica] It's a robot.
Beg your pardon?

A flying robot.

Is such a thing possible?
Hmm.


<i>Something spectacular.</i>

<i>Something revolutionary!</i>


It talks.

It talks.

[both chuckle]

[Buddy chuckling]

You talk.


By Jove, Jeronicus, you've done it.

You are a genius, old friend.

I wouldn't say that.
Oh, no, no.

If I know anythingâ€¦
Some people call me brilliant.

[both chuckling]
â€¦there's more where that came from.

I have 30 years of notes.
Then I have no doubt!

Oh, look at you!
I'm going to bally well kiss you.

We're kissing now.
From now on,

whatever you need, the bank will give.

For the rest of your life.
Okay!

[Delacroix] He's a genius! Spectacular!
[Buddy] <i>Genius.</i>

It's a merry, merry Christmas indeed!

Go in, go in! See for yourself!


What's happening? Buddy? Put me down.
[Buddy whooping]



Grandpa J, just let go.

Let go of what?

[Buddy laughing]

[Jeronicus chuckles] Oh!


[both laughing]

[upbeat music playing]



Follow me, Buddy. Come on.

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, everyone!
[Buddy] <i>Hello!</i>

Jangles and Things is open for business.

The world of wishes and wonder.

Jerry! Oh! You get down
from there this instant!

Hey, Edison!

Up, up, and away!

[Jeronicus laughing]

<i>stolen from Jeronicus was returned to him.</i>

<i>And they laughed and sang,</i>

and danced, just like those flames.

[gentle music playing]

Keep looking.

See them now?

You can see them, too?

You didn't think you were the only girl
who could see things, did you?

[gentle music playing]

You're Journey.

Yes.

[gasps]
So Jeronicus Jangle is

our great-great...
Great-great-grandfather.

Yes.

Yes?

Yes.

[all chuckling]

Why didn't you tell us before?

Well, I had to wait for the right moment,

when you needed it the most.

When youâ€¦ [sighs]

â€¦were ready for the magic.

Because it's been ready for you.


Hello, Buddy.
[young girl] Whoa!


[Buddy chiming]

[kids laughing]

Hello, Buddy!
[Buddy] <i>Hi!</i>

[young boy] Oh my gosh!

[upbeat music builds]

[young girl] Whoa!

[young boy] Look at that!
[young girl] It's so beautiful!

Whoa!

Is that Jeronicus's factory now?


<i>â™ª Nothing's gonna slow me downâ€¦ â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause finally I see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Finally I see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's all possible â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Watch me rise high above my obstacles</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª Watch me become
Who I'm supposed to beâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Let's go!

[young boy] Whoa!

Not so far away.
[young boy] I'm flying!

Grandma!
Look at your brother.


If you believe, it's all possible.
