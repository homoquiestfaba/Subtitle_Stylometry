<i>I'm Stacy, that baker from Chicago,</i>

<i>who flew to Belgravia
to enter a baking contest,</i>

<i>but then switched places with Margaret,
the Duchess ofÂ Montenaro,</i>

<i>who looks just like me.</i>

<i>I'm guessing you remember
I married Prince Edward,</i>

<i>and you probably remember that Margaret
fell in love with my best friend Kevin.</i>

<i>Cutest couple ever, right?</i>

<i>But what you don't know,
is that since all of that happened,</i>

<i>the King of Montenaro died,</i>

<i>and Margaret is now
in line for the throne,</i>

<i>which has royally messed up
everything in the romance department.</i>

<i>I've been pretty busy,
but take it from me,</i>

<i>happily ever after is never easy.</i>

[chuckles] <i>Especially for a princess.</i>
[crowd clamoring]

[crowd cheering, applauding]

{\an8}Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for!

{\an8}The final results of Belgravia's 59th
Annual International Baking Competition!

And here to announce the winner
is head judge and past champion,

Stacy De Novo Wyndham,
Princess of Belgravia!

[in American accent]
Thank you.

Thank you.

We are so pleased

that these incredible bakers have come
from all over the world this Christmas.

[crowd cheering, applauding in distance]

Christmas is about giving...

[in distance]
...and this year's contestants

have given us creativity,
excellence and artistry.

So without further ado,

our first prize winner is someone
I competed against two years ago.

This year he has created a cake
that is very special to me.

The first time I kissed my husband
Prince Edward was under the mistletoe.

Everyone, give it up for Zach Brachmann
from Munich, Germany

and his mistletoe masterpiece.

[crowd cheering, applauding]

Congratulations.

Congratulations.

You were positively charming today,
darling.

All I did was hand out some ribbons.

I'm just sorry I didn't get to see
the whole ceremony.

Yeah, parliament ran over, yet again.

It's all good.

Well, I don't know if it is,

with my taking on more
of the king's responsibilities

and you running the royal charities
and your bake shop, thereâ€¦

There hasn't been much time
for the two of us.

Well, what we do is important.

We're important too.
I don't want to lose that.

Well, the good news is we'll be
in Montenaro by the end of the week.

Hmm.
We'll have plenty of time together.

Christmas in Montenaro
sounds absolutely enchanting.

It does.

But I'm worried about Margaret.
Why?

Well, have you seen this?

"Is the Duchess ready to rule?"

And this?

Margaret never expected to be queen.

Remember how much she hated the spotlight?

Well, with her coronation
televised on Christmas Day,

she's going to have to
get used to it pretty quickly.


She just sounded so sad when I called her.

King Dennis died

and Prince Howard abdicated soâ€¦
Yeah.

â€¦like it or not, she's next
in the line of succession.

Remind me, why are we talking
about Margaret again right now?

Because I can't sleep when I'm worried.

Well, there areâ€¦

Other things we might do
to relieve your anxiety

besides talking about Lady Margaret.

To tell you the truth.
I think she's not over Kevin.

I mean, the breakup must have been
incredibly hard for both of them.

We could light a fire.
She was about to move to Chicago.

We could open a bottle of wine?
They were almost engaged.

We could put on some music.

Did you know Kevin
was shopping for a ring?

Stacy!
What?

They went their separate ways.
People do it all the time.

I know. It's justâ€¦

Olivia texts me every single day.

She says that her dad's
miserable without Margaret.

He turned down the invitation
to the coronation.

Apparently, he doesn't want to see her.
Well, men never know what they want.

I know what I want.

I have a great idea.

Why don't we take a teeny tiny
little detour to Chicago

on our way to Montenaro?

Oh, darling. I wish I could
get away sooner. I really do.

Butâ€¦ Unless you want to go
to Chicago without meâ€¦

[both laugh]

Ooh! Yay! I'm gonna pack and catch
the first flight out in the morning.

{\an8}<i>â™ª Feelin' naughty and nice â™ª</i>

{\an8}<i>â™ª Either way it feels right
When you're sitting next to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª By the fire at night
Light a candle, mulled wine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In our cups for a little treat â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Could be stormy outside
But with you I don't mind... â™ª</i>

Thanks so much. Merry Christmas.


A dozen Christmas cookies, please!

Stacy?

[Stacy chuckles] Hi!

I missed you!
I missed you.

Stacy! What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood and thought
I'd check on my business partner.

I love the new location, by the way.
Thanks. Where's Edward?

He's meeting me in London
on our way to Montenaro.

Ooh.
Well, you look fantastic.

Thanks, and you lookâ€¦

Comfortable.

Yeah, it's all good.

He hasn't gone on a date since
the breakup with you-know-who.

I have a business to run. Remember?

Life isn't about working all the time.

I know, which is why we're adopting
another cat for Christmas.

Another cat?

Yeah. You can never have too many cats.

We need to talk.

How about you go and wipe down
one of those tables over there?


So, what's up?

Well, you're wearing sweatpants,
you won't date and you're collecting cats.

And?

Two years ago, you handed me
an invitation that changed my life.

It's time for me to return the favor.

Stace, Margaret and I
called it quits six months ago.

Yeah, which is probably the dumbest thing
you've ever done in your life.

We just didn't want
the same things anymore.

Besides, I mean, she's moved on.
I've moved on.

Really?
Yeah.

'Cause you don't look
like you've moved on.

I've already sent the RSVP.

[clears throat] About that RSVPâ€¦

It kind of never made it to the mailbox.

Livâ€¦

Kevin, go to the coronation as her friend.


Inheriting the throne is huge.

Margaret needs us to be there for her,
all of us.


She's my friend too.

Fine.
[Olivia and Stacy giggle]

Hey! Call the cat sitter.

Maybe before we leave, you should get,
like, a haircut and a real pair of pants.

What's wrong with these?

Thank you, Frank.

Wow.


[in British accent]
I'm so happy you're here.

Me too.

I was afraid you'd be too busy
to manage it.

Oh, nonsense.
There's no way we'd miss your coronation.

Which is exactly what I told her.

Mrs. Donatelli, you look amazing.

Oh, thank you. And you look positively
radiant, Your Royal Highness.

Well, Stacy was born to be a princess.

It feels like ages since I saw you.

Well, we're here now
and, uh, we brought you a little surprise.

Olivia!
Margaret!

Look at you! Oh!

She's grown up since you last saw her.

Indeed she has.

When we didn't receive your RSVP,
we weren't sure you were coming.

I hope it's okay that we're hereâ€¦

As friends.


Of course, it is. As friends.

Can we see your palace?

[laughs]
[Margaret] Right this way.

Hello!

Margaret, why is everything covered?

I haven't quite settled in yet.

Isn't there a Christmas Ball coming up?

There is, but I stopped the staff
from decorating the residence.

Honestly, I was thinking of canceling
the festivitiesâ€¦

The concert, the ball, all of it.
Why?

It doesn't seem right.

The country is still mourning
the loss of their king.

It's also celebrating its new queen.
Yeah!

The people are looking to you
as their new ruler, Lady Margaret.

You're their hope for the future.

Well, the problem is I don't know
if I'll ever feel at home here.

Well, I don't know.

A palace can feel quite cozy when you
share it with people you love.

Well, I suppose it can.

If you ask me, this place is in need
of some serious Christmas cheer.

You really wouldn't mind lending a hand?

Let's deck these halls.

["Underneath the Tree" playing"]

<i>â™ª You're here where you should be... â™ª</i>

[Stacy] Ah.
[bells jangling]


<i>â™ª Alone on Christmas Day... â™ª</i>

[both laughing]

Gorgeous!
Dad!

<i>â™ª Don't mean a thing
If you ain't holding me tight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're all that I need â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Underneath the tree tonight... â™ª</i>


[both laugh]

<i>â™ª Make sure that you know... â™ª</i>

Watch your step now! Comin' in hot!

You got it?
[Stacy] Yep.

Yeah.

<i>â™ª Christmas was cold and gray... â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Another holiday â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Alone to celebrate... â™ª</i>

[indistinct chatter]

<i>â™ª One day everything changed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're all I need â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Underneath the tree â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're here where you should be
Snow is falling... â™ª</i>

[Olivia] Look at that tree.
Hey.

Huh?


<i>â™ª Presents, what a beautiful sight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't mean a thing
If you ain't holding me tight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're all that I need â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Underneath the tree... â™ª</i>


Only one thing missing.

What's that?
Hot chocolate?

Oh. Coming right up,
but I'll need a helper.

I was going to play Twister
with Edward and Stacy.

Right, guys?

Yes, Christmas would not be the same
without Twister.

Right.
Maybe Margaret can help?

I suppose I could give it a whirl.

Soâ€¦ where is the kitchen?

This way.

[Stacy giggles]

Good thinking.
Thank you!

Yes!

Okay. We need sugar,
powdered cocoa, milk and vanilla.

All right.

You've, uh... never been
in here before, have you?

Of course I have.

Let's check the refrigerator.

Dear me, it's empty.

Okay, good one.


Ah. The sugar's behind the flour.
[Kevin] I'll get it.

It's quite all right.
It'll be easier if I get it.

I told you... [gasps]

[Margaret laughs]
[spits, coughs]

Not funny.
No.

You want funny? I can give you funny.

No!
No.


[squealing, laughing continues]

What in the world is going on here?

Antonio!

I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow morning.

I hope I'm not interrupting.

Not in the least.
[Antonio] There's just so much to review.

I thought we should get a jump on things
over a cup of tea.

Of course.

Kevin Richards.

Forgive me.
This is Antonio Rossi, my Chief of Staff.

I'd shake your hand, but...
No worries.

My pleasure.
Go.

I got it.

You're sure?
Yeah.

Well, all right.

Now, about the concert on Christmas Eve,

it would mean so much
to everyone if you attended,

especially to the children.

All right, I'll go.

As long as there are no speeches.

No speeches. I promise.

Just a brief reception after andâ€¦

All you have to do is smile
and shake some hands.

Did you confirm my meeting
with the Treasury Secretary?

He'll be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

And I'll be there as well.

Tonyâ€¦

Did you always attend
cabinet meetings with the king?

Not always.

But I thought
you could use a little guidance.

Maybe I overstepped.

Not at all.

But I have to learn
to do this on my own.

I have been training
for the past six months.

I just want you to know I'm here for you,
whatever you need,

whenever you need me.

That's very sweet.

[ornaments clattering]

[chuckles]
[ornament jangles]

I'm just bringing a few extra things
for the... for the mantle.

Like tinsel.

You can never have enough tinsel!

At least that's what
my nana used to say.

She was a big fan. Really big.

Of tinsel?
[Stacy] Yeah!

The biggest.

She used it for everything.

You know, once she knitted me
a tinsel sweater.

Anyways, don't mind me.
I'm just gonnaâ€¦


Come in.

Hey, um...

can I borrow some hairspray?

I thought you don't do hairspray.

Oh, I don't. Just on special occasions.

Ah.

And will you be wearing your nana's
tinsel sweater to the ball this evening?


I forgot to pack it.

Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

Uh...

What's the deal with you and Antonio?

I've known Antonio forever.

We went to school together.

And now he works for you?

He served the late king
for the last three years.

Seemed prudent to keep him in place.

Why do you ask?

No reason. I justâ€¦

Saw the two of you in the dining room,
and you looked kindaâ€¦

Cozy.

Tony's been an enormous help to me.

And are you two a thing?

We've had a few business dinners.

That's all.

But he's very dear.

And very handsome.

You know, Kevin has been looking
pretty hot these days.

Yes, he has.

But you know
things didn't work out between us

and I can't spend my life
wishing things had turned out differently.

Maybe it's time for a second chance?

It's late.

We'd better be getting ready.

The ball starts in two hours.
Yeah, okay.

Stacyâ€¦

Did Kevin say anything?

About what?

About, well, his feelings for me?


You should ask for yourself.

{\an8}[guests chattering]

[guests laughing, chatting]

Has anyone ever told you
you were born to wear a tuxedo?

You...
Oh.

...every time I wear a tuxedo.

Hmm?
Hmm.

I hate to interrupt
the smooch fest, butâ€¦

Ta-da!

That is one serious party dress!
Right? And look at my dad.

Ta-da!
You'd better.

[fanfare trumpeting]

Her Royal Highness,
Lady Margaret Delacourt.

[playing fanfare]

[guests applauding]

[man] Your Highness.
[woman] Your Highness

Now's your moment.

My moment for what?
Ask her to dance.

Go. Kevin!
[Kevin] Uh...

[Edward chuckles]

I must say you are the most beautiful
monarch in the history of Montenaro.

Oh...

I've heard that our first queen,
Judith the Brave, rivaled Helen of Troy.

Yeah, but her dance moves
really sucked, though.


Let's show them how it's done.

All right. If you'll excuse me.

Here we go.

[classical arrangement
of "Silent Night" playing]

I'm really happy
you decided to be a part of all this.

Me too.

To tell you the truth, Iâ€¦

Wasn't sure we could still be friends.

Yeah, things got complicated
after the whole queen thing happened.

I suppose they did.

Things used to be so spontaneous for us.

Well, here's an idea.
Why don't we go back to spontaneous?

How?

Well, if you have time tomorrow,
maybe we can go for a drive.

As friends?

Sure, as friends.

Sounds like a lovely idea.

What could possibly come between two
people who look at each other like that?

[in British accent] Yo, let's get
this party started, shall we?

Excuse you.

Announce me.

I...
Do the thing.



Uh...


[laughs softly]
Ooh!

[sighs]
[chuckles]

Here we go.

Must we really do this?
Pics or it didn't happen.

Say <i>fromage!</i>

[camera clicks]


Double chin! That's a delete.

But no worries, it happens.
Not to me, but it happens.

Fiona, I'm soâ€¦ elated you could make it.

Oh, you certainly have learned
how to throw a party. So proud of you.

Proceeds from tonight's event
go to one of the royal charities.

There's an orphanage
in particular need, St. Michael's.

We're running a toy drive.

Of course you are,
you cute little Mother Teresa.

How long are you in town for?

Until your big day.

And then we jet off
to Capri for the New Year's,

but I fully intend to spend as much time
as possible with my favorite little cuzzy.


Well, hello, tuxedo man.

Me?

This is my friend Kevin,

his daughter Olivia, Princess Stacy
and Prince Edward of Belgravia.

Everyone,
this is my cousin Fiona Pembroke.

Pembroke as in Lord Percival Pembroke?

The one who died of a peanut allergy?
[Margaret] Her father, my uncle.

Oh my God,

you're the one who switched
places with my cuzzy!


You two seriously look like twins!Â Spoopy!

It means spooky.

Have you two done the switch thing since
you tied the knot with his Royal Hotness?

[Edward chuckles]
Fiona, please!

Minions, I need more champagne.


Oh yeah, gorgeous.

Oh, it's such a pain
to find good help these days.

You're yummy.


Wow!

I mean, I can see the family resemblance.

You can't miss it.

But is she really related to you?

Fiona's always been a free spirit.

She inherited quite the fortune
when my uncle died.

Guessing there isn't much of it left.


Though she still has the old
Pembroke Estate in the country.

She keeps Reggie and Mindy on staff,
but I've no idea how she pays them.

Your Highness,
I apologize for disturbing you.

The Prime Minister is asking for you.

Of course.

I have a meeting
with the Treasury tomorrow morning.

Shall we say two o'clock?

You got it.



[man] Are you having a good time?
[woman 1] Yes, I am.

Oh, stop it!

[indistinct chatter]

[woman 2] So sweet.

[woman 2 giggles]

Is that all of it?

The place was dripping with money.


[groans] Never mind. And you?
Hmm.

Explain to me how this is
going to pay for a summer in Capri.

It's double ply.
And your point is?

It's double ply!

I'm so tired of this!

If you're tired, Mindy,
then come up with something better.

I can't be the looks
and brains of this operation.

I thought I was the looks!

And that's why you're not the brains.

Why can't you be the one who gets to be
queen instead of your stupid cousin?

Then we'd be set for life.

Just stop talking.

Leave me.

[door opens]


[door closes]

[door opens]

[door closes]

How was the Treasury meeting?

I've spent the last several months

analyzing the impact
of tariffs on the trade deficit.

No one's even asked for my opinion.

They will.

How do you know?

Because I know you.

Margaretâ€¦

I've been thinking, and, umâ€¦


I've been looking everywhere for you.


I hate to bother youâ€¦ again.

Butâ€¦ there's an urgent matter
requiring your immediate attention.

We'll be back in an hour.


It really can't wait.

I'm so sorry.

Hey. Do what you have to.

I thought there was something urgent.

There is, but it's not what you think.

I knew if I didn't do this now,
I'd lose my nerve.

What's this all about?

Margaret, I'd be lyingâ€¦

If I told you I served you
only out of a sense of duty.

You're not just about to become
the Queen of Montenaro,

you've also become
the queen of my heart.

Tony.

This is for you.

I was going to give it
to you at Christmas,

butâ€¦ I want you to have it now.

Oh.

It's beautiful.

We've been friends
for a long time now, you and Iâ€¦

But lately I've been wishing
we could be something more.

Oh. I, uh...

I really don't know what to think.

I'm rather confused about everything.

Doesâ€¦

Everything include that friend of yours?

I don't know.

Maybeâ€¦

Margaretâ€¦

It's all right.

It's such a relief to hear you say that.

You know, we'd make a fantastic couple,
you and I.

Everyone says so.
[laughs]

Just promise meâ€¦

You'll at least consider it.

All right.

What was I supposed to say?

I thought you and Antonio
weren't a thing.

We're not,

but Tony's been a huge help to me.

Don't you think
he's trying just a little too hard?


Tony's always spent a bit
too much on things he shouldn't,

but we've known each other
since university.

But maybe he's right.

Maybe we could be good for each other.

You and Kevin are good for each other.

There's so much water
under the bridge, Stacy.

Kevin and I haven't even begun to talk
about what went wrong between us,

and every time we try, we never get
a chance to finish our conversation.

I don't know if we ever will.

Well, maybe you need to try harder.

Is love really supposed
to take so much effort?

Look, I know it in my heart.

You and Kevin are meant to be.

And I used to know it too,

but maybe all we're meant to be
is a happy memory.

I got your message. You wanted to see me?

I did.

Thank you for coming.

What's up?
This is terribly hard to say,

but here it is.

I'm not sure
you're being fair to Lady Margaret.

You want to explain that?

I know the two of you
were involved for a time andâ€¦

I can tell the relationship
was very meaningful.

But, uhâ€¦

But what?

Could it be that you're holding her back?

If that's the way she felt, she'd tell me.

Yeah, uh...

Lady Margaret's very confused right now.

I'm certain she doesn't want
to hurt your feelings, but, uhâ€¦

Have you really considered
what's best for her?

Let me guess, you're what's best for her?

Look, I know you care deeply for her,
Mr. Richards, butâ€¦

When affairs of state overwhelm her,

are you really sure
you're the one she should turn to?

You're a baker from Chicago,

and I'm certain a very good one,

butâ€¦ are you truly
a consort for a queen?



Hey, what's up, kiddo?


Now!

About what?

Operation "Get Dad Back Together With
Margaret," it's going to crash and burn.

Yeah, tell me about it.

But I have an idea.

You want us to do what?

Switch places again.

You said you needed more time
to talk things over with Kevin,

but you can't do that
because you're too busy.

So Stacy can be you,

and you and my dad
can spend some quality time together.

It's terribly risky.

It was risky the last time
and you're the one who thought of it.

Yes, but you're a princess now
and I'm about to become queen.

We can't just stop everything
and swap lives.

Why not?

With everything
that's going on with Tony...


If you know for sure
that it's over with Kevin

and you want to get serious with Antonio,

we won't say another word about this.

Do you really think we could pull it off?

Again?

Well, the only thing on your schedule
tomorrow is the Christmas concert.

All you have to do
is sit and wave to people.

Yeah, and when it's over Mrs. Donatelli
will walk you...

I mean, me, through the reception
and then it's back to the palace.

That way, you and Kevin have
plenty of alone time together.

And then we switch back.

I suppose it could work.

Does that mean you'll do it?

Did you talk this over with Kevin?


Did you talk this over with Margaret?

Yeah, and she's good to go if you are.


Maybe she's better off with Antonio.
[Stacy groans]

He's a nice guy.

Yeah, well, you're a nicer guy.
Yeah!


Did you tell Edward about this?

The less people who know, the better.

Yeah, I'll fake a cold or something.

Look, it'll only be for a few hours.

Okay, and I'll tell him everything
as soon as it's over.

You need to do this, Daddy.

If Margaret's inâ€¦

I'm in.
Yay!

[squeals, grunts]

[all laughing]

Oh, there you are, darling!
Been looking all over for you!

Oh, well, you know me. Always busy!

Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about.
Can we talk about it later?

I was just on my way to the kitchen
to do some Christmas baking.

Well, I was actually hoping
we might be able to find a moment

to do something together.

We will. I promise. As soon
as I'm done in the kitchen, okay?

Why the change of clothes?

Oh, what, these old things?

I am donating them to the orphanage.

I better get them to Frank.
He's coordinating everything.

Didn't I get you that scarf
last Christmas?

You did. I love it so much, I got
another one to donate to the orphans.

Yeah. I love you. Bye.

[audio feedback squealing]
Hey, what did you do that for?

Do I really need to explain?

[Reggie] Everyone's a critic.
[Fiona] Ever wonder why?

No.

Well, maybe you should.

Well, maybe I shouldn't.
Maybe you should.

Maybe I shouldn't.
Maybe you should, mate.

Maybe I shouldn't.
I think you should.

I'm not going to...
Maybe you should both shut up and listen!

Well, if you've got something to say,
Fi-Fi, just spit it out.

[makes buzzing noise]

I figured it out.

Figured what out?

Well, our big score.

I'm listening.

Remember when you said
if I were Margaret, we'd be set?

Uh... [laughs]

Yeah, but, umâ€¦ you're not Margaret.

Well, of course
I'm not Margaret, Einstein.

But, if Betty Crocker fromÂ Belgravia
could pull the switch,

why can't I?

I'm not feeling it.



My Ariana Grande phase.


I wouldn't have to do it for long, just
long enough to get crowned queen

and transfer a small fortune to an
unnumbered bank account in the Caymans.

Oh, I'm starting to feel it!

Then we spend the rest of our lives
sipping piÃ±a coladas on a beach

in a country that doesn't have
an extradition policy.

Yeah, baby!

You're first cousins, so you know
the family history, right?

Hmm.

You're welcome,
and you grew up here with Margaret

before you went to school in the States.

So, we do the hair, we lose the nails
and the contouring,

which is the only thing
giving her cheekbones.

Excuse you!

And no one's gonna notice
the little extra junk in the trunk.

What are you saying?
Hey, I'm agreeing with you!

Hold on!

We've got a big, big problem here.

Well, spit it out.

Cousin Mags ain't gonna go along
with any of this.

Which is why you'll have to grab her
and stash her somewhere.

And to do that,

I'm gonna need to know
exactly where she's gonna be

and what she's gonna be doing
for the next few days.

That shouldn't be
terribly difficult to find out.

Maggie! Maggie Moo! It's your cuzzy!

Oh! So sorry. Didn't see you there.
No worries, Royal Six-Pack.

Can you tell Maggie
I've got something for her orphans?

Howâ€¦ generous.


I'd like to deliver it in person.

Well, I'm afraid Lady Margaret's
turned in for the evening.

Yes, tomorrow's a busy day.

Huh. What's she so busy with?

The Christmas concert.

Yes, the Montenaro Children's Choir.

There is a reception afterwards
if you'd like to catch up with her then.

Hmm. I do love a good reception.

And where's your princess bride?

Yes, I was just looking for her, actually.

So, I'm sure you get this all the time,

but it's completely mad how much
your wife looks like my Maggie Moo!

It still amazes me.

And is it really true they traded places?


And they met where,
at some silly little contest?

A baking contest,
over a spilt cup of coffee.

They ran into one another
on the way to the powder room.

The powder room? Lol.

Oh, I believe Frank is
coordinating the gifts for the orphans.

Oh.

Well, then I guess this is au revoir!

Ms. Pembroke, what an exquisite surprise.

I have something for you.

Oh.

But first...
Yes?

Have you been naughty or nice?


Wellâ€¦

Between us,
the correct answer is "naughty."

Naughty. Hmm.
Hmm.

[snarls]
[laughs]

Meow.
May I help you?

Oh.

For the orphans.

Thank you.
Mm.

I know when, I know how...

[car door opens]
...and I know where.

The concert's tomorrow,
so we have to hurry.

Call you from the road.

[car starts]

[tires screeching]

Ah.

Oh, Olivia! You look festive this morning.

It's Christmas Eve!

So it is. We have a concert to attend.

Um, about that, Stacy says
she has a headache. She can't go.

Oh.

She was fine ten minutes ago.
It came on really fast.

I should check on her.

She told me she was going back to sleep.

It's probably better
if we don't wake her up.

Hmm. Good point.

See you!

You ready?

Ready.

["Candy Cane Lane" playing]

So ready.

<i>â™ª Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane... â™ª</i>


What?
So gross!

<i>â™ª It's the best â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So get dressed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And impressed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You and the colors of the rainbow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane
With me. â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's so magical... â™ª</i>

Here you go.


<i>â™ª So get dressed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And impressed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With the lights along the window â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Candy Cane Lane
Bring a friend this holiday â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bring a friend who loves to play â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll eat all the candy canes, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Candy Cane Lane... â™ª</i>

I love it.

<i>â™ª Bring a friend who loves to play â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll eat all the candy canes, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Candy canes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll eat candy canes... â™ª</i>

All right. Finishing touches. Rings.

Oh yeah. It feels weird taking it off.

Her subjects adore her.

They love how she smiles.
They see you, you're there.

You're waving.
Why am I waving?

Because they wave!
No, no, no!

I grew up with her.
She doesn't wave all the time.

<i>â™ª Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane... â™ª</i>

She stands very erect and she holds her
hands like this. I don't know why.

<i>â™ª We can dance â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Holding hands... â™ª</i>

[in British accent]
And the earrings.

Walk, swagger, walk, swagger, walk,
swagger and pose. It's simple!

[gasps]
[giggles]

[in British accent]
Lovely. A bit more like this.

Hmm.

Yo.
[in American accent] What are you doing?

What?
I'm not a gangster, just relax.

[both laughing]

You enter with confidence!

Posture. She holds her hands like this.
It's not! It's about service...

<i>â™ª Christmas is waiting for you... â™ª</i>

[in American accent]
What do you think?

Even better than last time.

[in British accent]
So, how do we proceed?

I'll escort you to the service entrance

from where Mr. De Luca
will drive you to meet Mr. Richards.


Here we go.

[in American accent]
I'll wait for you downstairs.

Are you ready?

Hell yeah.

Penny for your thoughts.

[in British accent]
Edward. How lovely to see you.

Are you going somewhere?

Stacy is under the weather,
so I thought I'd take a stroll.

Ah, yes.

A stroll a day keeps the bad weather away.

And you don't want to be under the weather
when the weather's badâ€¦

Well, don't let me keep you.

Actually, you're not keeping me at all.

In fact,
it's rather fortuitous I ran into you.

Is it?

I've been meaning to talk to you about,

something I hope you
keep in the strictest confidence.

Do you really think now is the time?

I need your advice about Stacy.

Oh.

What kind of advice?

Well, to be completely candidâ€¦

Things have beenâ€¦ different
between us these past few months.

It seems as if she's always got
something to do or somewhere to be.

Well, I'm sure you're very busy as well.

Yeah, I suppose.

But I daresay that most of what I do is to
keep busy while she's otherwise occupied.

I'm honestly worried that somehow
I've let her down.

That perhaps married life
isn't what she hoped it would be.

Well, thatâ€¦

Thatâ€¦

That couldn't be true.

Has she said anything to you?

Anything that might make you think
she's having second thoughts about us?

Not a peep.

Because nothing is more important to me
than her happiness.

Stacy's everything to me.

[Donatelli clears her throat]

Your car is ready, Your Grace.

Yes, just one moment, if you please.

Everything will be all right, Edward.

I promise.


Oh, I thought I'd see how Stacy's feeling.

Don't do that.

Why not?

Because... because she said she was going
to take me Christmas shopping

for my dad's present
while he's at the concert,

but now she can't.

So she said you'd do it.
Don't you want to go to the concert?

Nah, I really want to surprise my dad,

but we better get going
before all the good stuff's gone.

Yes, I suppose we could run out
and find a little something.

Let's go.


{\an8}[Stacy in American accent]
Here we go again.

{\an8}[Donatelli] You'll be fine,
Your Royal Highness. Come on, deep breath.

[crowd clamoring]
[cameras clicking]

[crowd applauding]

[crowd chattering]

Frank.

Thank you.

Welcome to Santa's Magic Village.
And we have the whole place to ourselves.

[in British accent]
How did you manage it?

Mrs. Donatelli. [laughs]

That woman rocks.

Indeed she does.

Kevinâ€¦

I'm so sorry about canceling yesterday.

We're here now. That's all that counts.

All right.


We can string some popcorn,
pet a reindeer, visit the North Poleâ€¦

[indistinct chatter]

[entrance bells jangle]

Huh.

[bells jangle]

Ooh. I quite like this one.

[Santa tie] <i>Ho ho ho!</i>

No, you don'tâ€¦

[text keys clicking]

Who are you calling?

Olivia, is there some reason you don't
want me to speak to Stacy?

Noâ€¦

I didn't want to say anything, butâ€¦

You're being a little bit
of a helicopter husband.

Sorry, what?

A helicopter husband.

You know, someone who hovers around andâ€¦

Doesn't give the other person
room to breathe.

Do you really think Iâ€¦ hover?

[bells jangle]
[door opens]

Right.

[bells jangle]
[door closes]

Perhaps we should have dinner out as well,
and do a little shopping for your friends.

I have lots of friends.

Brilliant.


<i>â™ª God rest ye merry gentlemen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let nothing you dismay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For Jesus Christ our savior
Was born upon this day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To save us all from Satan's power... â™ª</i>

[choral music continues, faintly]

[engine stops]

Showtime.

The service entrance
is right there in the alley.

We'll need five minutes
to get past security

and then we'll let you in.
I know, I made the plan.

Just stay here till I come and get you.

Okay.

<i>â™ª And a Happy New Year â™ª</i>

[audience cheering]


[uproarious cheering]


[cheering continues]


[Margaret and Kevin laughing]

What do you think?

I like her smile.

She hasn't smiled in quite a while.

Funnyâ€¦

Because he told me
he had the same problem.

They say love conquers all,

but it's not so straightforward, is it?

No.

It's not.

The truth isâ€¦

There's no one else in the world
I'd rather be with.

That's not what you said six months ago.

I thought we were going to live
the simple life.

You, me, and Olivia,
you know, take things easy.

Be spontaneous.

Things were going good until your cousin
decided he didn't want to be king.

I know that this whole royal affair
isn't what you want.

But it's who I am now.

I can't give it up.

But the truth is
I don't want to give it up.

It's become more than just a duty for me.

I love this country.

I love the people.

This is something
that I was destined to do.

It's who I am now.

I know.

And I don't want you to give it up.
You don't?

No.

You're gonna be a great queen.

The thing isâ€¦

I just don't want to hold you back.

How could you ever hold me back?

You need someone who's your equal.

Someone who knows the ropes.

Antonio's all that.

I'm not.

Don't you see?

None of that matters.

You're the one I love,

not Tony.

You don't have to be a count
or a prince or a king.

You just need to beâ€¦

You.

Are you sure about that?

I was heartbroken when you said
you just wanted to be friends.

I only said that because you said that.

[both laughing]

Oh.

[sighs]
[Kevin] Lookâ€¦

Maybe the spontaneous thing to do is

give us another chance.

I do love spontaneous.

[Margaret chuckles]

Oh!

[both laughing]

[strings playing "O Christmas Tree"]

[indistinct chatter]

Ladies and gentlemen,

our sponsor and patroness,
Lady Margaret Delacourt.

[guests chattering happily]


Mrs. Donatelli!
You're just the person I'm looking for!

I'm afraid now isn't the time, I...

This dreadful man is threatening
to post lurid details

about Duchess Margaret and Prince William!

[Reggie gasps dramatically]
[Stacy gasps]

I am terribly sorry, Your Grace.

You clumsy oaf!
No, it was an accident!

Oh, not to worry.
It's just a silly little spill.

If I get you to the ladies' room quickly,
I can get that out for you.

Jolly good! Back in a jiff.

All right. What is this all about?
No, I don't.

[door opens]

Right in here, Your Ladyship.
Thank you, Mindy. You're an angel.

Well, some say.

I haven't seen Fiona. Is she here?

[screams]
Sh!

[grunting softly]


Surprise!

Now it's my turn to switch.

[Fiona laughing]

[Stacy groaning]

[Mindy] Hurry up!
This is as fast as I can go!

Oh, dear. All right.

All right, then. Come on, gently does it.

[Stacy in American accent]
What are you doing?

Where are you taking me?

[both laughing]

Margaret Delacourt, is it really you?

Who else would it be?

Where is my driver?

Don't you remember me?

Of course I do, you'reâ€¦

Shannon Earle!

Only now it's Shannon Earle Carlisle.

We went to Oxford together!

Oxford. Dear Oxford green.

Oh, it's Oxford blue.

I'm color blind. Driver!

You were in my Italian class.

Dolce &Â Gabbana.
My car, now.

Take me to the palace.

[Reggie grunting]


[Reggie] All right.
[Mindy] Blimey!



([Stacy groaning]
[Reggie and Mindy grunting)


Your royal suite, your Highnesty.

[in American accent]
I'm telling you,

you kidnapped the wrong person.

People are gonna be looking for me.
[Reggie] Yeah, yeah. All right.

My husband is going to be looking for me.
[Reggie] Uh-huh.


"Your Highnesty?"

Oh, shut up, Reggie.
[laughing]

Me? Your Highnesty.

[Reggie continues laughing]


Meow!

[moans softly]


Come to Mommy.


[door opens]
[Margaret] Stacy, I'm back!

Who is it?
It's me, Margaret.

I had the most enchanting time of my life.

Oh, myâ€¦

Kevin is the most wonderful man
in the world.

You were absolutely right.

All we needed was a little time together.

I've never been happier in my life.

And I owe it all to you, you darling girl.

Well, you and Olivia.

Oh, Stacy, I'm so glad
you talked me into switching places.

Didâ€¦

Did I really have to talk you
into switching places?

I was honestly terrified
we wouldn't be able to pull it off again,

but apparently we did.

Apparently.

I hope the Christmas concert
wasn't too much trouble.

I love a good concert.

Well, if you'll excuse me,
I need to change for dinner.

I don't want to keep Kevin waiting.

By the way, your accent is much better.

Dinner with Kevin?

Aren't you the least bit concerned
about Edward?

What has any of this got
to do with Edward?

He is your husband after all.

Don't be silly.

Stacy.

You know how much
I treasure our friendship,

but barging in here and going on about
how you're planning to cheat on Edward.

Well...

I think you better go.

Stacy, the game is over.

I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

This isn't funny.
It's time to switch back.

I insist you take your leave at once.

You must be joking.

Or would you rather I call the guard
and have you thrown out?


That won't be necessary.




We are so screwed!

You're such a drama queen.

We grabbed the wrong Maggie.

This one's got free Wi-Fi
and Taco Tuesdays.

Oh, and a cabana boy!

You're not going to need
a cabana boy in prison.

So, would you two
please stop talking and focus?

All right, Fi-Fi!
There's no reason to get testy.


Really, Reggie?

Because I think there is.

I think there's a very big reason.

If your cousin's there,
then who've we got in the basement?

Well, the look-alike from Belgravia.

She did say you grabbed the wrong person.

Me?

So now it's my fault?
Well, it's not mine.

[Reggie] <i>It's not mine!</i>
[Mindy] <i>Yes, it is.</i>

[Reggie] <i>I's not!</i>
[Mindy] <i>It is.</i>

No, it's not. I was following you!
It's 'cause you said...


All rightâ€¦

You said this was a get-in,
get-out job, right?

So?

So all you have to do is get out faster.

Well, no can do.
The coronation isn't till tomorrow.

So move it up to tonight.

And how am I supposed to do that?

Hello? You're going to be queen.

<i>You make the rules.</i>

I do, don't I?

Hmm.

But first I've got some
dinner plans to cancel.

Darling!

So glad your headache's better.
There's something I have to tell you.



I need to apologize
if I've hovered too much,

you know, like a helicopter,
circling about and buzzing all the while.

Why are you speaking
with a different accent?

I'm not speaking with an accent.
I'm Margaret.


Don't be silly.

Why won't anyone believe me?

You're serious.
Yeah.

I've never been more serious in my life.

But Stacy promised me that she'd never...
It's my fault.

I needed time with Kevin
and Stacy was only trying to help.

No one was supposed to know.

If no one's supposed to know,
why are you telling me now?

There's been a bit of a snag.

Well, a rather major snag to be precise.

Come on now, remember our chat.

Twenty-five years...
Come on, happy face.

Mrs. Donatelli? Are you all right?

No.

No, I am most certainly not all right.

The most awful thing has happened.

After 25 years of loyal service,
Lady Margaret hasâ€¦

Well, she's given me the boot.

She says that she doesn't need me anymore,

and she's moved the coronation
up to tonight

so that she can spend Christmas
with the orphans.

I would never fire you, Mrs. Donatelli,

and I certainly am not moving up
my coronation.


Lady Margaret?

Oh. [laughs]


Andâ€¦ he knows?
Yes.

And you've not switched back yet?
No.

And I can assure you the woman upstairs
in my suite is not Princess Stacy,

unless she's gone
completely off her trolley.

Let me see if I follow this, soâ€¦

If the two of you haven't switched back

and this is Lady Margaret,

and if Lady Margaret upstairs isn't Stacy,

who's upstairs and where's my wife?

Off with their heads.



Who...

Who is it?
It's Kevin.

Come in.

I know, I'm kind of early butâ€¦

Oh! I can come back later if...

No, Kevin, please stay.

There's something we need to discuss.

Yeah. Sure.

Everything okay?

I'm afraid it isn't.


The time we spent together today
was truly magical.

Yeah, I thought so too.

But it isn't right.

Deep down, we both know it.

You need a wife and your darling
little girl needs a mother.

Like it or not, I have a country to run.

And I can't be the wife
and mother you both deserve.

That's not true.

Don't make this harder than it is.

But you said...
You must forget what I said.

I was emotional. I wasn't thinking.

Margaret, this isn't like you.

Please,

it's best for both of us
if we end this now.

You and Olivia need to go home.

You really mean that?

Because if you do,

I'm not coming backâ€¦

Ever.



Bye!

Hello?

Hello, can anyone hear me?

Hello!

I still don't understand what happened.

She changed her mind. That's all.

Are you sure she wasn't pranking you?

Livâ€¦

I know how much
you care about Margaret,

but it's time to let go.

For both of us.

But, Daddy...
Livvieâ€¦

let's go.

Come on.

Get in the car.

Airport, please.

Very good, sir.

After the concert what happened?

We were separated for a few minutes
at the reception,

and then she returned
to the palace in her limousine.

Without you?

I'd been informed that she'd already left.
So I took a separate car.

So something must have happened
after the concert and before you returned.


The drink!
Ah-ha! So you were drinking!

Not me, you fool.

The man with your cousin Fionaâ€¦ Reggie.

He spilled a drink on your dress.
Stacy's dress.

Yes, and then Fiona's secretary
took her to the ladies' room.

Ah-ha!
What are you thinking, Frank?

I have absolutely no idea, sir.

I think I know.

They made the switch
in the powder room.

They kidnapped Stacy
because they thought it was me.

So the woman upstairs is your cousin.
I wouldn't put it past her.

And underneath all that peroxide,
there is a striking resemblance.

So if Fiona's associates took Stacy,

where would they go?

I'm guessing
they're at her father's old estate.

It's less than an hour away from here.

Right. I'll get the car.

I'll deal with Fiona.

Well, I wouldn't confront her just yet.
Not while they still have Stacy.

Right, then we'll come with you.

Notify Count Rossi of our suspicions
and have him delay the coronation.

Right away, Your Highness.

Bingo.

I honestly don't understand the urgency.

Then I shall review it for you again.

I intend to spend Christmas with
those poor, poor orphans at St. Matthew's.

Aren't the orphans at St. Michael's?

I am in charge

and you as my loyal subject must do
precisely what I tell you to do.


I wouldâ€¦

If you were really Lady Margaret.

But you're not, are you?

How dare you question me!

You're Margaret's cousin.


I'll have you arrested for treason.
I don't think you will

because I can prove it.
I'm calling the guards!

All it takes is a close look at your hand.

The little tattoo on your pinkieâ€¦

You should take greater care
to cover it up.

So now what?

I'm guessing you're after money.

You're not stupid enough to think that
you can maintain this charade for long.

So you can either make me a partner
in your little scheme

or be exposed
as an impostor and a traitor.

You don't need my money.
You're filthy rich.

My eldest brother inherited
the majority of the family estate,

which left me with expensive tastes
and a very small income.


What about Margaret?

Once you've gotten what you came for,

you'll vanish without a trace, which means
Margaret never has to know anything.

I'll make sure the coronation
happens tonight.

And afterwards, you'll meet
with the Chancellor of the Exchequer

and make an incredibly generous donation
to a fictitious charity

of which you
are the Chief Financial Officer.

As soon as you write a check to me
for my services,

I'll arrange for your discreet departure.

You can do whatever you like
with the rest of the money.

When we arrive, everyone keep alert.

There's no telling
what we'll find when we get there.

Mm-hmm. And it's a good thing
that these are registered weapons.

Frank! Hands on the wheel!
All right!

[hums softly]

Your dinner is served.

Hello?

Your Highnesty?

Hello?

You playing hide and seek?

You are!

[Stacy grunts]



[Reggie whimpers]



Oy! Come here!

[Stacy panting]
[Reggie grunting]

Oh my God.

[Stacy grunts]

[Reggie yelling]

Is anyone there?


Where do you think you're going? Oh!



Get me out of here. Reggie!

Oh! Whoa! Oh!

Sirâ€¦
[Margaret] Oh dear, Edward!

Stacy? Can you hear me?


[Edward] Stacy?
Thank God.

Come here!


They're over there! Go!

Call the police! Frank, you're with me!
Always, sir. Always!

[Stacy grunts]
[Edward] Get away from her!




[Stacy and Edward gasp]


I'm so sorry.
I should have told you everything.

As long as you're all right,
that's all that matters.

I promise you I will never make you
feel like I'm too busy for you ever again.

And I promise I will never hover
like a helicopter again.

Wait, what?

It doesn't matter.
Okay.

Margaret...


[clears throat] I'm so terribly sorry
to interrupt, Your Graces,

but Fiona is headed to the cathedral.

Right, let's go.

[organ music playing]
[voices murmuring]


The coronation is scheduled
for tomorrow on Christmas Day.

But I'm going to be
at St. Michael's on Christmas Day.

I've promised the orphans.

I thought the orphans
were at St. Matthew's.

It's a world tour of orphans.

Your Excellency,

but there's nothing
in canon or civil law

that prevents an heir apparent
from selecting the date of the coronation.

[door opens]
I know the law, sir,

and it clearly states that
a representative of the civil government

must be in attendance
when a new monarch is crowned.

I spoke to the Prime Minister an hour ago.

And here she is now.

I see.

We'll need some time to prepare.

Wait a second,
wasn't that the turnoff for the airport?

It was, but the bridge got washed away
six months ago.

Terrible flood.

A flood? In June?

Summer storms can be so unpredictable.

As long as we don't miss our flight, man.
We wouldn't want that.

Is Your Majesty willing and able

to take this sacred oath
to uphold the laws and customs

of the Sovereign Nation ofÂ Montenaro?

Yes, I am.

Willing and able.

Then repeat after me.

I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourtâ€¦

I, Margaret Clara Karen...

Margaret Katherine Claire.

I, Margaret Katherine Claireâ€¦

Dela...
Delacourt, right.

I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt...

I command you to stop
these proceedings at once.

Oh, dear Lord. There are three of them.

No, Your Eminence.

There is only one Margaret Delacourt
and I am she.

The woman you were about to crown
as your queen is an impostor.

Antonio, tell them.

Guards,
arrest this woman at once for treason.

Antonio, it's me.

Don't you dare!

And you are?

I'm Princess Stacy Juliette
De Novo Wyndham of Belgravia.

Fiona kidnapped me
thinking I was Margaret,

but I wasn't Margaret
because Margaret and I switched places.

I'm very confused.

I understand exactly how you feel,
Your Eminence,

but it seems the woman
you're about to crown

is actually Lady Margaret's cousin.

Is this true?

Fiona, it's over.

Reggie and Mindy are in police custody.
They confessed to everything.


Oh, all right, it's me,

but I didn't want to go through with it.
That freak Antonio made me do it.


Margaret, she's lying.

You were ready to throw me in prison.

Look, if you'll only just listen to me...

I've listened long enough.

You almost had me convinced
that I wasn't ready to rule on my own,

but the fact is I've never been
more ready for anything in my life.

I love Montenaro.

I love its people and I've learned
everything I can about them

for the past six months, so I can
serve them to the best of my ability.

You don't know how to command.

Watch this.

Arrest him and take him to the dungeon.

I bet that felt good.

You have no idea.

[door opens]

[door closes]

One tiny teeny little question.

Since I technically didn't kidnap you,
am I really guilty?

Yes.
Yes.

But, Maggie Moo,
it's Christmas and I'm your cuzzy.

Are you kidding? You committed treason!

Well, I didn't mean to.


You know, it's always been hard for me,

growing up with parents who despised me.

They didn't despise you.

The truth is
I've always wanted to be you.

I just got carried away this time.

But I could never be half of what you are.

You were born to be queen, even
though you didn't realize until now.

I owe you an apology, Moo.

I behaved abominably. I'm sorry.

You're the only real family I've ever had.

The only one who truly cares.

Poor, poor girl.

Oh, please.
[Frank] What?

I suppose I could ask the judge
for a reduced sentence.


Along with supervised community
service for many, many years.


but are we proceeding
with the coronation?

The coronation will proceed
on Christmas Day as scheduled.

Now if you all will excuse me,
I really must call Kevin.

We were supposed to have dinner hours ago.


What about Kevin?

He would have found me out,
so I had to send him packing.


Dearâ€¦
[text keys clicking]

No, he's not answering.

I'm guessing he's on his way
to the airport with that small person.

His daughter?

He mentioned an Octavia.

You mean Olivia?

That's what I said.

Frank, get the car.

At the double, sir.

Keep the change, man.

Don't worry, sir.

Everything's gonna be all right.
I guarantee it.

Yeah. Thanks.

[car door shuts]

It can't be. No. It can't. It can't.

[man on PA] <i>This is the final boarding</i>
<i>call for Monten-air flight 201 to Chicago.</i>

That's us. Come on. Excuse me, sorry.


Right, let's go. Right.

Looks like we made it on time.



Kevin.

Come on.

Kevin!

Kevin, please don't leave.
I can explain everything.

You look like Stacy
but you sound like Margaret.

Well, because I am Margaret.

We never switched back.

Oh.

Why are you dressed like that?

Fiona kidnapped me
and took Margaret's place.

Rightâ€¦

Don't you get it?

It wasn't Margaret who told you to leave.
It was Fiona.


Nothing has ever been more true.

I can't imagine my life without you.

I can't imagine my life without you.

Well, thenâ€¦

Marry me?

That's what I was gonna ask you
last summer.

[Edward gasps, chuckles]
Wait.


Would someone say yes, please?


Yes.
Yes.

Thank you.

Why don't we make this official right now?


Oh, that's what I love about you.

Be right back.

[clears throat] Excuse me.

If it wouldn't be too much of a bother,
we'd like to be married.

What, here, now?

Aren't youâ€¦

Margaret Delacourt, the future queen. Yes.

This is my fiancÃ©, Kevin.

Well, my flight boards in five minutes.

I'm sure they'll hold your flight
for a royal wedding.

An abridged version would be fine.

I wouldn't want to impose.
Are you sure about this?

Real sure. Come on.

All right.

[priest clears throat]

Perfect.

Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today in the sight...

[man on PA] <i>Monten-air Flight 507,</i>
<i>nonstop service to London Heathrow,</i>

<i>is now ready for boarding at Gate 58.</i>

That's my flight.

Just cut to the chase.

Have you prepared your vows?

I think we can wing it.

I promise to walk by your side foreverâ€¦

To love and support you
in everything that you do.

And maybe someday teach you
how to make a hot chocolate.

[all laugh]

I love you, Margaret.

I always have and I always will.

I love you too.

Dearest Kevin,
I wish I could promise you the world,

but the world is not mine to give.

What I can promise you

is my world

because it would be empty without you.

[crowd applauding]

I don't suppose you have a ring.

[laughs] Oh.
I bought it last summer.


[crowd gasping]

It's beautiful.

Do you, Kevin, take Margaret
to be your lawful wedded wife?

Oh, yeah.


Do you, Margaret, take Kevin
to be your lawful wedded husband?

I absolutely do.

What God has brought together,
let no man put asunder...

[man on PA] <i>This is the final boarding</i>
<i>call for Monten-air Flight 507,</i>

<i>nonstop service to London Heathrow.</i>

<i>All ticketed passengers
should proceed immediately to Gate 58.</i>

I now pronounce you man and wife.
Now I am out of here!

[crowd applauding]

Oh! You may now kiss the bride.

Come here.

[crowd cheering, clamoring]

[whooping, laughing]

Oh!

And she just so happens to be a queen.
Oh, yeah.

{\an8}[cathedral bells tolling]

{\an8}[knocking]

The clerk says it's time.
Oh, she's almost ready.

I'll tell him.

Edward.

I know our first two years together
have been kind of crazy.

I already told you,
you don't need to apologize.

It's more of an explanation
than an apology.

I wanted so badly
to be the perfect princess

and do everything right thatâ€¦

I forgot about what's important.

And what's that?

It's you and me.

And maybe one day
our very own little prince or princess.

I'd like that very much.

[clears throat]

We really have to start.

Give us a minute.
