In his goodness may he continue to
pour out his blessings...

upon these sons and daughters of his.

May he make them faithful members
of his holy people.

Jason I baptize you in the name of the father...

and of the son and of the holy spirit.

This child of yours has been enlighten by Christ.

He is to walk always as a child
of the light.

By the father of our lord Jesus Christ
I free you from sin.

We now anoint you with
the prism of salvation

As Christ was anointed priest, prophet, and king.

So may you always live as a
member of his body

sharing everlasting life.
Amen.

In the name of this child.

In the spirit of a common sonship,

let us pray together in the words
our lord has given us.

Our father who art in heaven

hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come

thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day, our daily bread, and
forgive us our trespasses

as we forgive those who trespass against us

and lead us not into temptation but
delivery us from evil.

The almighty God, the father, the son,

and the holy spirit bless you.
Amen.

Now as we receive our new member

This is Tour.

I don't get a whole lot of work here you know.

But if you want you can look for
other jobs or whatever you know

You must get lonely.

Look Rob I don't want to be ungrateful...

I really appreciate what you're doing
for me and shit...

but I got to make more fucking money.

Hey man, if I could pay you more
I would you know you're...

good at what you do man.
Really good.

I could fix up that old Mack truck that's sitting
there like your goddamn lawn ornament.

That's good you can go ahead and fix it up
but I don't have the money to pay you.

You know, there are other things that
can be done you know.

Like what?

We could rob a bank.

-You're full of shit.
-I'm not full of shit.

I've done it four times myself and
stopped twelve years ago.

It was getting too hot.

As long as you don't do it too
many times, your fine.

You got a kid?
You want to provide for that kid?

You want to maybe edge out your competition?

You got to do that using you're skill set.

And your skill set...

very unique.

What do you say?

-Go fuck yourself.
-Okay.

Well, good luck supporting your family

I want to take care of my son.
That's my job.

Let me do my job.

Okay, how how are you gonna

Don't say it like that.

-But how are you gonna take care of me?
-Don't...

Don't talk down to me.

It's a question.
I'm not talking down to you.

-It's just a question.
-I'll find... find a way to do it.

You want a house?
I'll get you a house.

You wanna get the fuck outta here?

That's every man's right.

-Sounds like a nice dream.
-Ro.

You can umm... use this if you wanna.
But keep in mind that...

I did four banks with a note.
In other words you don't need the gun.

I never liked guns man.
They're vulgar.

But you may want to take it.
I don't... whatever you wanna do.

How do we do it?

Okay, first thing is we're gonna go
in there nice and early.

Just when the doors open okay?
You're gonna take a look at all the tellers...

Go for the oldest woman you can alright.

Failing that, go to the most meek.

Get her to put the money out on the table.
Why?

So that way you can see if there's
a dye pack.

You put it in your pocket.
You don't hand anything over to them.

You don't show them the gun.
And you go.

Get on your bike.
I'll be about four blocks away.

Ride it into the truck.
Bam we're home, we're done, we're rich.

What happens if you get stopped sitting by
the side of the road with a open cube truck.

What are you gonna say?

-What do you mean what I'm gonna do?
-I'm a officer...

Excuse me sir what are you doing with
a open cube truck?

What are you doing?
Why are you sitting here like this?

Thank you for asking officer.

-That's a nice touch.
-Right.

-Is your name Luke Glanton?
-Yes.

Mr. Glanton a complain has been filed...

it alleges assault in the second degree
which is a felony in the state of New York.

When such a complain is filed, you have the right
to an adjournment to obtain a lawyer.

Counselor do you wish to waive any
further reading of the arraignment?

Would your honor, on behalf of my client,
I enter a not guilty plea.

Given the history that I am aware of this defendant
and as well the allegations...

I'm going to set bail in the amount of $2,500.

Bail may be posted either in cash
or by bail bondsman.

In the mean time I will issue the temporary
order of protection

requiring this defendant to refrain from
violent, offensive, assaultive, or...

harassing conduct, and to remain away from the complainee.

There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.

I want to do two in one day.

I want to do the Trustco on Brandywine.

When all those fucking pigs are
coming after me...

I'm going to split out the back.
I wanna go down to Rotterdam...

and I want to do that First National.

You know something Luke,

I'm not going to let you bring us both down.

-Fuck that, don't be such a fucking pussy.
-No man, it's over.

I can't do it.
Won't do it.

-You made your fucking choice.
-Fuck you!

Hey, you know what?

Avery Cross, nice to meet you.

-Yeah of course. I know who you are.
-I know your father, you know.

-Long time now.
-I apologize.

No, no, no, he's a great guy.

I wouldn't have expected anything
less from his son.

This was ah, above and beyond.

Ah no, I just did what anybody would do.

-Yeah.
-That's right. And better.

-I don't know if I could...
-The whole force is pulling for you man.

Don't you forget that. They're all outside.
Banners and everything.

-What happened to that guy?
-That guys gone. He's dead. It's over.

It's the way it happens.

-Right?
-Yeah, but did he leave anybody behind?

That's not, it's not for you to
worry about right now.

We got people who are going
to talk to you about that.

There's people talking to his family.

Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.

-Alrighty?
-Yeah.

-Bill wants to ask you a few questions. That alright?
-Just your first impressions, that kind of thing, you know.

-I just wa....
-Formalities, you know?

-Yeah, it's pretty simple.
-Sure.

-Yeah.
-Alright I'll leave you to it, get to know each other.

-Alright.
-Alright.

So what happen when you were
just outside the door?

Um, I said "Police uh, drop your weapon."

Um, "Face down on the ground
with your hand spread."

-And uh, nothing.
-Nothing?

Nothing.

-Did you announce yourself again or not?
-No.

No. That's all we need to do is
make ourselves known right?

Yeah. But it's sometimes not easy to tell whether
if they've heard you making yourself known.

You know what I mean?

Anway, you were yelling,
is that right?

-I was making myself known as we were trained, correct.
-Okay. Alright.

Okay.
Then what?

At that point I knew I had to make
entry and I kicked the door down.

-Was the door, was the door locked?
-Correct.

And you knew that because?

-What do you mean?
-Did you assume that the door was locked?

-How did I know it was locked?
-Yeah.

Is that a trick question?

No, no. I'm just wondering why
you didn't turn the thing.

That's how I know it was locked.

Did you tell me that?

-No.
-Okay.

-Alright so you kick it in?
-Right.

Why are why... why did you come down here?

-I'm sorry, why did I come down here?
-Yeah, why wasn't it somebody else?

Slow day at the office?

No.

-What happened after that?
-What would you like me to tell you?

-I just need you to tell me what happened?
-You do?

I don't want you to misremember
so tomorrow...

you're trying to match what have
you have thought today.

I only want you to tell me what you saw.
What you remember?

I shot the perpetrator.
He fell out the window.

I know that.
When did he pull his gun?

Did you shoot him first or
did he shoot first?

Don't fuck with me. Do the right
thing. Tell me what the fuck happened.

It was pretty quick.

Who shot first?

His hand comes up. You fire.

His hand comes up.
He fires. You fire.

-Right.
-Like that?

-Yeah.
-Like pop, pop.

That sounds like he shot first.

Yeah.

It's just a triumphant day for
officer Avery Cross.

He left Ellis hospital well enough to go
home and happy to be alive.

With supporters from his Schenectady PD
family cheering him on...

His father, State Supreme Court Judge Al Cross
says he's very happy his son is alive today.

It's the life of a cop.
A life my son chose.

Twenty nine year old Cross hasn't
even been on the force for a...

full year before he ran head on
into the alleged Moto Bandit.

Pursuing Luke Glanton through the streets
of Schenectady after a bank robbery.

Glanton ran into a home.
Then he came face to face with Officer Cross.

Glanton fired at Cross,
hitting him in the knee.

Cross fired back. Killing Glanton
and saving the hostages.

Glanton was a drifter and at
times a motorcycle stunt rider.

Police say he had a very violent past.

The guy had a long track record, you know.
He was a professional criminal.

He moved here last spring and it hasn't been a full
month before he started robbing banks here.

He leaves behind an infant son.

Coming up....

Was it scary, honey?

It happened so fast.

I don't think there was time
to be scared.

Scary for me.

I just don't understand why you're doing this.
Nobody does.

Doing what?
What...what... what am I doing?

I was speaking with your father and we...

-We both agree.
-Of course...of course... of course he does.

-I'm sorry I just saw...
-I'm a cop Jen, I'm a cop.

-I just thought maybe after this maybe you would have
had enough. That's all.
-Hey, there's no more to discuss.

I just thought maybe it
would have been enough.

That's it.
Okay?

-You...you can't expect me not to think that.
-You guys just don't get it.

-I'm sorry. We're just worried. We're just worried about you. That's all.
-Stop saying that.

Stop fucking saying that.

Have you been replaying the
incident in your mind?

Not really.

Nah, I just try to... I'm trying to uh
put it out of my mind I think.

Does that work?

Yeah.

You think you're ready to go back to duty?

Yes.

Would you want yourself as a partner?

Absolutely.

What have you been thinking
about since the shooting?

Not much um...

Have... has... everything's been so crazy
you know.

With the rehabilitation and the...

work and everything at home.

Everything at home?

What's happening at home?

Well, I'm there now.

-It's just much different.
-Who's at home with you?

Well, ah my mother in law ah.

My wife and my boy.

So there's um...

You know its been hard on my... my wife.
It's a shock.

And an um... it doesn't help
that there's a baby around.

But it's okay.
I mean it's okay.

What do you mean that it doesn't
help that there's a baby around?

Well I just mean that with everything
that's... that's going on...

We're justing trying to...
to get all this in order.

Before I can take care of that.

It... it's been hard it... it... it...

I've just been so busy that its been...

hard to uh...

I've... I've hard time...

looking at my son.

-And that's something new since the shooting?
-Mmhm.

You know I... I saw in the police record that
this perp also had a one year old son.

His name is Jason.
You been thinking about this?

This you mean...

-The fact that he had a boy?
-Yeah.

Do you think...

You're having a hard time looking
at your son because...

you're thinking about this other
little boy that won't have his father?

-You expecting somebody?
-No. You?

-Hey.
-Hi.

-Hey.
-How you doing?

Hey.

-Hey, hows the gimp doing?
-Hey, come on in guys.

Nah we're just coming in here to check
up on you and see how you're doing.

-Hi, how are you Jen?
-I'm good. How are you Scotty?

-Oh I'm alright. I'm doing good. Better than this guy.
-Oh he's okay.

Come on in.
-How are you doing?

-Hey Pete, how are ya?
-Good.

-Good to see ya.
Good. Good seeing you.

You ever meet my wife Jennifer?

-No, hi. It's a real pleasure to meet you.
-Hi. Hello.

-How are you?
-Hey, how are you?

-You know Doc?
-We've never meet. Avery Cross. How you doing?

-That's my wife Jennifer.
-Hey, how are you?
-Hi.

You guys hungry?

Nah we'll... we'll... we'll just.. we'll just leave you to it.

-No, come on in. Have some dinner.
-Nah. No, no, no, we didn't come here for dinner.

-Well we've got plenty of food. Come on in.
-Well I...

-There you go.
-Oh yeah.

-Want some salad?
-I'm glad we decided to do this.

Oh good. I'm glad you guys came to visit.

Thanks.

So how's it feel to have the hero home?

Probably can't wait for him to get back to work huh?

No. It's... it's great having him home, I just...

Thank God he's okay, you know.

God bless that.
I think we should toast on that.

-To our hero.
-To hero boy.

-Hero boy.
-Here you go.

Glad you're okay.

I've been on the force for twenty two years,
pulled the trigger maybe three, four times.

You're on for six months,
you already got one in the bag.

And he was white.

That's an extra fifty.

-Better him than me right?
-You got that right.
-Absolutely.

You guys have any plans for tonight?

-Um.
-No, we're just um...

-This is it.
-Yeah?

This is the big plan.
Having you guys here for dinner.

Would you mind if we stole the hero
for a little police work, after this?

-Tonight?
-And we'll have him back by curfew.

I don't know honey. You should probably
rest tonight. Maybe tomorrow night.

Yeah... we kind of need him tonight.

-Is there a problem?
-What about your... your leg?

Well, we're not going to be running.
We'll carry him.

What are you gonna do?

We just want to introduce him to a bunch of people
who really admire him for what he did.

They just want to congratulate him in person.

Good, it sounds good.

We leave in about twenty minutes.

Not that we want to eat and run
but, we are on duty.

No you should go. That's a great idea.
I'm sure everybody would love to meet you.

-There you have it.
-You're a hero.

I hear a little sarcasm in your voice.

-Me?
-Yeah.

-He is a hero.
-Yeah.

-He's a hero around here, that's for sure.
-You don't mind if we take him than, do you?

-Not at all. I think it's a great idea.
-Yeah. Alright.

There you have it.
You're released.

-Release the hounds.
-Yeah.

Hey Avery...

Does she sometimes like to tuck her
balls up at least at night?

Hey, Pete.
Pete.

-What?
-Can you pop the trunk?

Sure it's okay with her?

-Scott, you know I"m not on active duty right?
-Yeah, we're aware.

It's a little gift I got going for you.

Lets go.

Police.

Hi.
Romina Gutierrez please.

-That's Romina right there.
-Yeah.

-Hi. Hi I'm Officer Deluca. Romina Gutierrez?
-Yeah.

Yeah, we're here to search your house.

What for?

-For evidence.
-Evidence for what?

We're looking for the money that Luke Glanton
may or may have not given to you.

Yeah, we don't have anything thing that that...

Ah you can't just walk in here.

Yeah I can.

-No you can't.
-Whys that?

Cause it's my house.

Look...

You assume that I have a warrant and I'll
assume that your mother has papers okay?

This won't take long.

Come on.

Kofi.

Can we just start upstairs okay?

No, no, no, no.
No, no, my baby is upstairs.

-My baby, my baby is upstairs sleeping.
-Baby's upstairs?

-Yeah my baby is upstairs sleeping, so we're not going to start...
-Alright. Well we won't rustle your baby.

No, no, no.
Don't go up there.

-Romina...
-Hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.

-He can't go up there.
-Yeah, he can.

You can go up there if you want, but if we
find evidence while you're up there...

-Your under arrest.
-Why?

We've done this a lot of times okay.
It'll be quiet.

Go on Scotty.
Be quiet.

-How about a cup of coffee?
-Yes, yes, yes.

That'll be great.

-Go into your living room here?
-Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

Thanks.

Sorry for your loss.

Romina, lets go.
Come on.

What are we doing?
What are we doing here?

Hey, this is crazy.

-Wait outside.
-I don't want to. We gotta go. This is fucked up.

-Why the fuck are we here?
-Let go of my arm man.

-What the fuck are we doing here?
-Let go of my arm.

-Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
-Shutup.

-About how long did you know Luke?
-A couple of years.

-Did you know he was robbing banks?
-No.

-You didn't know that at all?
-No.

Let me just ask you one more time
because this is... this is what we do.

-You have no knowledge to this money?
-No.

-Officer I swear to God.
-It's not here?

-No
-It's not outside?

If I was gonna hid something
I would hide it closest to my heart.

Scott.

Pick him up.

-Pick up the baby.
-I don't think we should.

-I don't want to wake him. I don't wanna pick him up.
-Pick him up, pick him up.

I'm good.

Put him back.
Lets go.

-What's up?
-Yeah, they're clean.

Alrighty, lets get out of your hair.

You got this Scotty, cmon.
Help him out will you.

-Scotty stop, stop.
-Give me a chance to count it.

You... you going to count like that,
we're going to be here till five in the morning.

-How are you gonna count it?
You got a money counter there asshole?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-Fourteen grand.
-$14,000?

Well it's not going to be a even split because
the lion's share is going to our hero.

Consider it unofficial hazard pay.

From us to you.

Enjoy it.

Cause you're not going to get
it from the department.

Don't spend it all on one place.

You fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.

Not bad huh?
Not bad for a nights work.

We're gathered here to celebrate a
cop who makes other cops proud.

We can all rest a little easier tonight
now that he is on the path to recovery.

Ladies and gentleman, Officer Avery Cross.

-Thank you.
-Thank you. Thank you for your support.

When I was in law school,
we used toalways talk about...

Justice.
We had discussions about justice.

That's just what they were.

Discussions.

I joined the police force because I
wanted to work alonside the...

brave men and women who know some
problems can't be solved by talk.

But no one wants to be in the situation
I found myself in a couple of weeks ago.

I certainly wish it had turned out differently.

I'm not going to lie.
Sometimes I haven't wished that...

maybe it wasn't me that was called
upon that house that day.

But that's the job.

But I can't think of another line of
work I would rather be in.

Thank you.

How does it feel?

I'm not sure it's doing much good.

-How's the spotlight?
-I'm ready for it to end.

Don't worry.
It will.

You know the police always put on a big
show when something like this happens because...

the hero card is the only
one they have to play.

I'm not really thinking about that Dad.
I'm just trying to get back to work.

You know if you planned this
it couldn't have turned out any better.

You're not going to make it work for
you in the police department.

I promise you that.

I didn't come here to be lectured Dad.

You tricked me.
You said the pool would be good for my knee.

-Sorry.
-You know, I'm not as calculated as you are.

My life is not a campaign.
It's much simpler.

Yeah.

Though for somebody who's not campaigning,
you gave a hell of a speech yesterday.

You certainly have my vote.

Plus that knee is a gold mine.

No I mean it.
A limp goes a long way in politics.

Look at Roosevelt.

I got to go see the chief.
I got to go see the chief.

-Where you going brother?
-I don't know. I don't know.

Is it bad news?
Is it gonna be bad news?

Oh Jesus Christ.

Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy.

I got a call today from D.A. Killcullen.

Close the door.

The state internal investigation into shooting of
Luke Glanton has been deemed lawful.

Congratulations officer.

You can put it behind you.
Get back to police work.

The question is can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon?

And if you could, can you be effective?

I don't think that I can.

That's okay. You know what there's a lot
of jobs to be done around here.

That in ways and you know that.

In ways that are much more important
than what happens out on the street.

I'm so glad that you said that. Because Chief I've
thought a lot about this and the...

I... I think I can be best utilized as... as lieutenant
in... in charge of special investigations.

There's a lot of restructuring ah within
the division that I've actually formally...

I can't fucking do that.

Well yeah, of course... of course you could.
I mean...

Cross come on.
You paid too much for your education to act so stupid.

But I think it is the very fact that I do
have a education like this that perhaps...

the reason why I thought about
how restructuring the... the unit...

-Um, the division can actually benefit you, me, and a couple...
-Cross, I appreciate you ambition. I really do.

Uh and uh I think... you know...you..
I think you are going to be a great cop.

You are a great cop.
You're a hero.

But at this point. Right now.
You gotta get back to real life.

-And in real life you got two choices.
-Which are?

-You can retire on disability.
-I don't want to do that.

Alright, good. I don't want you to do that either.
Or...

You can be reassigned at your current rank.

That's it.

You gotta work your way up man.

Hey man.
I heard you were down here.

Hey.

What are you doing?

What are you doing on plain clothes?

Oh you didn't hear?
I made Vice.

-Get the fuck outta here.
-Yeah man, I'm actually paired up with Deluca.

Good.
What have you got for me?

Oh yeah. A couple of mutts left this in the back
seat of their car with a leaky substance.

Oh nice.

So when are we going to get together?
Grab a little bite.

I want to talk about some things.

-Sounds great.
-Alright man.

-Page me.
-Okay.

Thanks.

What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.

The only reason I'm asking you is
because you're my friend.

Well I don't know what I can do to help...

-but yeah. What do you need?
-Alright. Right on.

Deluca and I have been working
on this case right.

And uh... I'm going to need you to
keep this to yourself. It's a little private.

And uh... I don't want anybody
to know about it, okay?

Okay.

Deluca and I have been working
with this fucking hooker.

We gotta fucking head her off
with some coke.

So Deluca and I thought that you know, if...

We need some temporary access
to the evidence room.

We need you to get some shit. We
gotta hit this bitch off. That's what he need.

I really tried to look out for you
with that seven grand.

Now I need you to look out for me.

I'm serious bro.
This is how it works.

Hey.

Hey don't worry.
It's okay.

So I didn't mean to startle you.

It's okay.
I just want to give you something.

Alright.
Listen.

This is the money we recovered from your house okay.
I want you to have it.

I don't know what that is.

You don't have to ever see me again.
Just take the money.

I'm not here as a police officer.
I'm here as a regular guy.

Listen, listen, listen.

-Get the fuck away.
-Listen to me. Listen.

You fucked up my son's life.

Therefore you fucked up my life.
Get the fuck away from me.

I should have brought this to you sooner.
I apologize.

This was recovered from...

a house during a search.

-No, what, what, wait a minute.
-That's just a small fraction of what's going on.

Wait a minute, Cross.

Don't say another word.

-What do you mean?
-No, no, no. Don't say another word.

What do you expect me to do with this?

-You're joking right?
-This is shit.

Chief.

This ain't my problem.
Alright.

This is your problem.

This is our problem of the fucking police department
and I'm bringing it to your attention..

because that's what I should fucking do!

Oh yeah?
-Is that right?

-Yeah!
Is that what you should do?

-Rat out other fucking cops?
-Chief...

This is unfucking believable alright.

Get this shit outta here.

Fuck.

Hey.

Where are you going?

Going home.

You know that thing...

you and Scotty been talking about?

Yeah.

Sure.

Well you and I have to talk about it.

Follow me.

Hey!

Hey Pop.

Avery.

There's a way out of this.

You're not going to like it.

You want to hear?

Yeah, I wanna hear it.

We'll start with the precinct.

Anybody there still trust you?

Scott.

We'll start with Scott.

Playing shortstop.

Looks good. Looks bigger.
Jesus Christ.

He's ready to dump you.
The whole thing.

Enough with these fucking tests alright.

Either ask me to help you or
just leave me the fuck alone.

I need you to go into the locker.
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

It's a... it's a kilo. It's a big brick.
It says Mckillen across it okay?

I need you take break up a chunk.
I need you to put it in a bag.

I'm going to come by.
I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

"I made a mistake."

You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer
with a Medal of Honor...

Nobody's going to question you, okay.

You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

No problem.

Alright.
I know I can count on you.

Yeah.

Tell Mike I love him.
I gotta go.

I need you to go into the locker.
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

It's a kilo. It's a big brick.
It says Mckillen across it okay?

I need you take break up a chunk.
I need you to put it in a bag.

I'm going to come by.
I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

Alright?

If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

"I made a mistake."

You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer
with a Medal of Honor...

Nobody's going to question you, okay.

You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

No problem.

Shown this to I.A.?

Of course not.

Handing it to you on a sliver platter.

Got any idea what this means?

Are you ready do it?

Are you son?
Are you really ready?

Cause they're going to fucking
tear you in half.

I'm going to need you're assurance
that you're gonna follow through.

Really?

And I'm going to want full immunity when you do.

You can't just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do.
You understand?

And when you do...

I want to be made assistant district attorney.
I have a law degree and I passed the bar.

-I don't have a spot for you right now.
-Make a spot.

I won't do that.

-I can't just snap my fingers and make you assistant D.A.
-You can say no.

You can say no.
I'll walk out this door.

I walk over to the Gazette.
I'll tell them everything I know.

-Including this conversation.
-You're not, listen. You're not going anywhere.

Don't.
Listen.

Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it.

-All three things?
-Alright.

I'm not going to promise you how
long you're going to stay there.

You're not going to shake my
fucking hand pal.

I'll make you assistant D.A.

I'm never going to shake your fucking hand.

You're too smart for your own good.

Get right in there for a good shot.

Detective, how do you respond to
these allegations?

Drugs, corruption, and gangs.

It's not an investigation by the
Schenectady Police Department.

It's an investigation into the
Schenectady Police Department.

Earlier today, D.A. Killcullen announced...

that his office, along with the FBI,
will be handing down indictments...

that would lead to the arrest of
these Schenectady police officers.

The D.A. is making allegations today that the
Vice officers were acting like the gangs...

that they were suppose to be hunting.

Officer Deluca stole drugs and money,
even guns from inside the evidence room here.

Officials say that with that stolen evidence,
the cops paid criminals...

to help set up their rivals. Which then
led to those headline robbing arrests.

The D.A. announced a star witness
in the case today...

Hero cop Avery Cross, who less than
a year ago was shot in the line of duty...

while trying to save two Schenectady residents
from the alledged Moto Bandit.

-In Schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton, News Channel 13.
-It's going to be alright.

Thanks Jess. It's the largest case of
fraud this region has seen.

You know when I was a kid, I used to
look at my Dad dressed in judge's...

robes and I used to think that
my father was a superhero.

And I don't think I was far off.

He had that quality that judges have
where they have tremendous compassion.

But they are also ferocious
at the same time.

He wasn't afraid of making enemies.

I think that's probably why
he had so many friends.

I had the chance right before he
fell into the coma to tell him that...

I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him.

And...

He shook his head no and
I didn't understand why.

So I leaned in close that he can
whisper and he said to me...

"I'll take the win, not the run."

That was my dad.
That was Al.

-Son, you want to come with me?
-Sure.

-Avery.
-Yeah.

-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Sure.

Close the door.

What's wrong?

We have to talk about AJ.

He wants to come and live with you.

He won't stop asking me about it.

Really?

I guess that's uh...

a good idea at some point.

I think he needs you.

I think if he doesn't come and live with you,
he's going to... completely go off the rails.

It's just that right now, you know,
with the campaign and everything...

It's just not an ideal time.

I mean, what am I going to do with him?
I don't know what he likes or...

I just don't think it will be
good for him or anybody.

I mean, come on.

Okay.

-You know that.
-Well you can tell him that.

-Jennifer.
-What am I suppose to tell him?

I just don't...
Why, why, why are you doing this right now?

You can tell him now.

Tomorrow we're going to head
to Buffalo in the morning.

Wednesday outer boroughs in New York City.
Then the Al Smith dinner at night.

Do we have time to get there?

We do, absolutely.
We'll get... we'll have our last event,...

close in Queens. We'll hit the Upper West Side...

-Then we have to be at the Waldolf.
-How about Youseth that driver we have from Manhattan?

-We can use Youseth totally.
-What's going on in Queeens?

In Queens, he's going to do an
event on environmental issues.

Um... talking about some of the,
protecting the...the Sound...

and doing some of the environmental stuff...

And Thursday at the Rochester for lunch
you're going to go to a place...

where you are going to order something
called the Garbage Plate.

I just want you to be prepared for it.

-Did you see that?
-Yeah, no, I just...

-Then Sunday morning black churches.
-Oh perfect.

Alright. I think we can get...

Avery Cross?

Yeah.
AJ

AJ?

-Yeah.
-Hi AJ.

So what high school are
you coming from?

From Troy High School.

-You're coming from Troy?
-Yeah.

Okay, so not too far away.
What brings you to Schenectady?

Um, my dad wanted me here.

-You're dad wanted you here?
-Yeah, for my senior year he wanted me to move.

What about you?
Did you want to come here for you're senior year?

I don't know.
Yeah... eh....

Nah, I guess not.
Not really.

-Do you know anybody here at the high school?
-Nah.

No, don't know anybody?

Just peak over you're shoulder.
Peak over you're fucking shoulder.

There you go.
Hello there, hello.

Hello.

You don't like them girls?

I don't know.
Maybe you're just used to it.

They ain't got girls like that where I come from.
You feel me.

Where are you from?

Troy.

Troy?

-Yeah. You heard of Troy?
-Yeah, I've heard of Troy.

-Where's Troy at?
-It's fucking right next door, dude.

Right next door?

I would have guessed you
were from Long Island.

Why's that?

It's where people that talk
like you come from.

Ah ha ha, see.

I'm bored as a motherfuck around here dude.
I've been here for like fucking three days.

I'm bored out of my fucking mind.

Well school can do that to you.

Well what you dudes do for fun?
Nothing?

This is it? This is what I got?
For a year?

-No, we got somethings.
-What?

Don't say like a mall.
If you say a fucking mall...

I swear to God.

What do you do?

I get high.

Well we can do some of
that around here.

I can tell you smoke.
I've seen you from back there.

You're one of them loner... loner
stoners is what I call them. Right?

You like to get high and like chill in
your room and draw and shit.

Whatcha trying to do with the rest of this day than?
You trying to go to math class?

You don't want to go get high?

-Lets go.
-Alright, lets go.

You know what this reminds me of?
The Goonies.

You know that movie?
Where like they're all in a cave.

You want a cigarette, just ask homie.

I'll take a cigarette.

I like smoking cigarettes
when I'm high.

You like smoking when your smoking?

You smoke menthols man?
Like a breath of fresh air.

Like a breath of fresh air
which you don't care...

You got the smoke puff glowing everywhere.
I swear.

Yo, here we go.

I say my spit is my ammo.
My mouth is my gun.

And I shoot up your whole squadron with
one flip of my tongue and you're done.

When did you write that?

Nah I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.

Fucking quiet around here.

Shit though, when I was a kid, there
was always kid playing here, you know.

Oh you came here
when you was a kid?

Yeah man.
I come here with my parents sometimes.

-Your parents still together?
-Yeah.

That's cool.

-That they're still together.
-Yeah, it's alright.

It's not my real dad though.

Where's your real dad at?

Um... he died actually.
Like in a car accident or something.

Shit.

Hey this is kinda bud dude.

But umm, do you know where I
can score some X?

Yeah.

For tonight?

Well we just did a downer.
We gotta get up.

-Remember to come back by yourself alright?
-Yeah man, you got it.

Lets go.

-Let me see it.
-What?

-Let me see the fucking drugs.
-You fucking seriously man?

Let me see my fucking drugs.

What the fuck?

-I gave you five hundo.
-Yeah, that's twenty pills.

Yo that's inflation or something right?

Oh yo what the fuck son.
Dead ass it's the fucking five-o.

-Oh fuck!
-Fuck!

-Police! Let me see your hands!
-Police! Get on the ground!

-Down, on the ground!
-Fuck you alright!

-Get on the ground!
-Interlace your fingers.

He scored Ecstasy from some Schenectady kid.

-Who arrested them?
-A couple of beat cops. McCracken and Potter.

-You know these guys?
-Mmhmm. They'll sit on it if I ask them to.

-Did anybody else see anything in there?
-No, I made sure of that.

-Didn't you get any sense that the knew this kid or?
-Huh, friends.

-Just the two of them?
-Yeah.

Okay.

Jason Kancam.

-I busted him a few years ago for some shoplifting.
-What's his name?

Jason Kancam.

-Gordon, can we kill the mic on three.
-Yeah.

And I know you don't have time to deal with this stuff right now.

Not him.
Okay?

-What?
-I want you to leave him alone.

Alright?

-Okay?
-Why?

Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me!

I want you to leave that fucking
kid alone, alright?

Look at me!
Look at me!

You want to come live with me right?

You think this is easy for me?
During this time? Huh?

I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it... for you.

You can have anything you want.
But I don't want you to touch that kid.

You leave him alone.
You underfucking stand me?

-Say yes!
-Yes.

-Look at me and say yes.
-Yes.

-Can you state your name for the record?
Jason Kancam.

-Jason, how old are you?
-Seventeen.

-Are your parents here today?
-Yes. Yes.

Can you come up please?

-You're Jason's parents?
-Yes.

Jason, you've been charged with criminal possession
of a controlled substance in the third degree.

Counselor, do you waive a formal
reading of the charges?

Yes, please your Honor. In regards to my
clients status there has been a discussion...

with the District Attorney.

Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case tentatively resolved today.

-So i ask if you could put it on for Second Call?
-Second Call.

This is a C felony, so Jason could do
anywhere between five and fifteen years.

But I'm getting the impression from the
Prosecutor that they may be willing...

to reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

The offer on his particular case...

would be time served. Which is the
day he spent in jail. And a fine.

And that would be it.

-Can he come home with us today?
-He can.

Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody is looking out for you.

Look, I didn't mean to get you
busted the other night, alright.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, that was a pretty shitty fucking night.

But don't worry about it.

I was outta there in five fucking minutes still.

You think I'm going to sit there and
get fucked up the ass all night?

What happened when you got home?

Huh?

Went upstairs.

Tried to go to sleep but I was
still tripping like a motherfucker.

Why?
What happened to you when you got home?

I'm cool man.

Ah your moms was all worried and shit?

Ah man, my moms...

I'm cool man.

-It's okay. I had trouble with math.

Hey, what's the deal with my dad?

hate him or something?

What was his name?

-God damn it.

How come Mom never talks
to me about my dad?

I'm your father.

Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

It's her business to talk about it.
Not talk about you.

Grandma used to tell me something.

She said like...

Just that he was like an outlaw.

I will always love you.

Can you at least tell me his name?

Hello?

I'm sorry Jason.

I'm sorry.

It was a tight race for over a
year between Cross and Kellerman...

and then unprecedented events over the last
month will lead to threaten Cross's election bid.

First allegations of underage drinking at his house...

and then a violent robbery
from a yet unidentified intruder...

that left his son hospitalized with a concussion.

Remarkably Cross has managed
to right his campaign...

And now as you see, the District Attorney
has just won the election for Attorney General.

We will go live now as Senator Farley
prepares to address the crowds of supporters.

I've had the honor of knowing
Avery Cross since he was a boy.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is my greatest honor to introduce

the next Attorney General of the state of New York.
Avery Cross.

AJ you gotta go. You gotta go out there.
You gotta go out there.

There's a flag. Go.
Go where the kid is. Go.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.
