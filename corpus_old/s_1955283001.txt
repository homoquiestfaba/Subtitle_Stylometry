My name is Darcy.

And this, is the end.

I know what
you're thinking.

She has the cute guy.

So life must
be pretty great.

Would you like to try
some of mine?

And you know what?

I used to believe that.

I used to think that up until
you found your soul mate,

-nothing was really complete.
-This is to die for.

But, it's not about
the guys at all.

In fact,
fuck guys.

It's about your friends.

You're gonna call
me a man-hater.

But that couldn't be
further from the truth.

I love men.

If anything,
i love them too much.

And that's what
got me into trouble.

I really was
having a good time.

But for you
to understand,

we have to go back
to the beginning.

--I've never had
the best of luck with men.

But, if I'm being
truthful with myself,

that's probably my fault.

I mean, look at me, bringing
flowers to my boyfriend

on our anniversary.

Sucker.

I was sweet, naive,

and maybe just
a little bit stupid.

That's why in life,

you need someone
to come in

and give you
a big dose of reality.

What the fuck?

Uh, why aren't
you at work?

Well,
this is awkward.

I was hoping to be clothed
when I finally met you.

Excuse me?

Well, there's pictures
of you in the living room,

and,
i was almost jealous,

but Jeremy explained
that you're his sister.

And you're--
you're really pretty.

What the fuck
is going on?

-She's um--
-I'm his girlfriend.

I can't blame her for
giving me the crazy eyes.

I'd probably do
the same thing.

-Baby, it's not what
it looks like--
-baby?

Yeah, right?
Three months?

How about three years?

You're not his sister.

This is just a one time thing,
i don't-- I barely know her.

I-- Kate, honestly,
it was just this one time

i-- it was just one time.
It was a mistake,

I made a mistake.

What, well, you couldn't
have chosen somebody better?

Baby, no one's better
than you, right?

-I mean, look at her, she's
a bit porky, don't you think?
-Hey.

What are you
talking about--

this is
so humiliating!

And that was
my first threesome.

â™ª See your heart beat
through your chest â™ª

â™ª and I feel like
I'm your prey â™ª

â™ª you've got me
by the neck â™ª

â™ª and I don't
wanna get away... â™ª

Does she know
you're talking to me?

In my life, Nora
was the big sister.

Theatrically
over-protective.

I just don't really know
if polyamorous is my thing.

If that's the word.

Um, yeah, I guess
i could do dinner,

with both of you,
on satur-- ow--

no, why are you
even calling her?

You are not man enough
for one woman,

much less two,
or twenty, or whatever.

What do you think
this is, "big love"?

You can't have
a million girlfriends.

Leave Darcy alone,
all right?

She's way better
than you.

Consider yourself blocked.

Bye.

-Trade?
-Yeah.

Okay.

Seriously though,
you should probably
block him.

Really? Thank you.

You're welcome.
You deserve a lot
better than that.

Really? Another dud?

The last guy was literally
tindering during dinner.

Why can't we
just pick for her?

That's strike three, Nora.

I'm gonna have to
call you back.

Really?
'Cause of this?

Management just saw
the donut petition.

I just said that I think
there should be donuts.

-Nora...
-It was discriminatory to have
bagels and not donuts.

You petitioned the staff to
get management to buy donuts.

I like my morning
with frosting and sprinkles.

Last month, it was the amount
of creamer options in here,

and how much time is given
for paternity leave.

I'm a woman
of the people.

Not anymore,
you aren't.

Management is concerned
that you aren't as passionate
about your work,

as you are about
the break room supplies
and the staff policy.

I'm sorry.

How many of these
do you think I can fit
in my mouth at once?

Ready for more?

-Please fit them
all in there.
-Mmm, round four.

Then there was Olivia.

She was more like
the matriarch of the group.

All right, ladies,

raise your glasses.

Here's to a new chapter.

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

She claimed to know
what was best.

And she was usually right.

How about more about
how you're a metrosexual,
'cause he's definitely Metro.

She seemed to have
the perfect life.

Complete with
friends just like her.

-You called him out.
-You revealed one
of your secrets.

I'm just telling you,
I'm not gonna drive,

-he's driving.
-Oh.

-This was amazing.
-It was.

-Thank you so much,
you guys, for having us.
-Anytime.

-Next time it's at
our place, okay?
-Okay.

No, it was a pleasure.

We don't see you guys
often enough.

You guys are so precious.

Hey, when are we gonna
go golfing again?

-Megan just bought me
a new driver.
-I'll call you.

And we're gonna have lunch
while these guys are out.

-You and me.
-I'd like that.

-Aw.
-Take care.

-Take care, you guys, see you.
-Bye, thanks again.

Drive safely.

They're so cute.

He's so nice,
isn't he?

He is.

Babe, can you pour
me a drink?

Are you sure
you need another one?

Please don't
make me ask again.

I'm just saying,
i don't think you need
another drink.

There you go,
thinking again.

Are you listening to me?

Look at me when
i talk to you.

Wipe that look
off your face, or
I'll do it for you.

I'm not gonna do this
with you again.

Okay?

But we all have our secrets.

And back to
the parents' house, again.

The secret's out.

--Thanks.

I wish I was just visiting.

Ow.

-Let's go hustle.
-All right.

Hurry, hurry.

Got milk.

--Delete that, right now.

We were a family.

Oh my god, you guys.
Do you remember?

My grill?

They called me
"metalmouth" for years.

Here's Olivia.

Sophisticated,
personified.

-Aw.
-Not here.

We put our friendship
above everything.

Including our love lives.

Is that Andy
in the background?

Ooh.

That's definitely him.

That was the year
before we met you.

Before Andy became
a shit stain.

-Do you remember
that day?
-No.

I was so mortified.

I can't believe anyone
believed that rumor, anyways.

Like I'd make animal
noises during sex.

He was obviously lying.

That takes more
coordination than you have.

True, true,
all of the breathing,

and the movement,
and the barnyard noises.

Watch out, or you will wake up
naked, tied to a porch,

like dear old Andy.

Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

Cocksucker deserved it.

Mmm-hmm.

Olivia!

Speaking of cocksuckers.

Here's Johnny.

Olivia! Open the door!

Olivia!

Come on baby,
let me in.

I called the cops,
they're already on their way.

Fuck!

Just sign
the divorce papers!

â™ª Lovers in the dust... â™ª

Oh my god,
she's gonna kill you.

Why? She's officially
the world's most desirable
bachelorette now.

-Hiking? She doesn't hike.
-Okay, but men love it.

It's all about
the workout pants.

She's not gonna
go for this.

This is an intervention.
She doesn't have to like it.

You're gonna help her
meet her mate.

Who is meeting
their mate?

Yeah,
"nobabies" dating site.

Is that actually a site?

You're already
online dating.

Yeah, we're just
helping the process.

Yeah, shut it down.

Really?

I have pigtails
in my profile picture.

But blair101 likes them.

He's a little cute, okay.

As a matter of fact,
he's quite attractive.

He's on
an online dating site.

That's never stopped
you before.

Fine, whatever.
Set it up.

Yes!

-Yup.
-No hiking dates.

-So, it's official?
-Yep.

Uh, technically
it has to go through
the system first,

but I am on my way
to being a divorcÃ©e.

Mmm!

Mmm!

-Here's to freedom.
-To freedom.

Mmm! Speaking of men,
how was your date last night?

Yes, how was it?

Was he as cute
as his pictures online?

Are you referring
to the Adonis that
you set me up with?

You could have prepared me.

I mean, you can't transition
me from geeks to gods

overnight.

So how did our man do?

He seems great.

I don't really
know him, but,

he seems sweet so far.

Mmm! Yes!

You see,
all you needed

was Nora's
matchmaking services.

Maybe I'll set you up next.

No. Focus on one couple
at a time, cupid.

-Mmm.
-Don't, we just
started dating.

You love him.
You love him.

Okay, let's not pat ourselves
on the back prematurely.

-Love.
-Please, stop.

All right, Nora,
you're all done.

-I'll see you up front.
-Thank you.

-You're good to go.
-Thank you.

â™ª Darcy and Blair,
sitting in a tree... â™ª

â™ª K-i-s-s-i-n-g â™ª
-this is cruel.

First comes love,
then comes marriage,

then comes--

okay, ladies,
i have to go to work, now.

Oh, crap, me too.

-Right, me three.
-Love you.

You're gonna roll
with that? Okay.

Um, cold.

-No repetition.
-Oh, damn, park.

-Darcy.
-Oh, wow. You're so smooth.

That's so sweet.

That's why they call me,
"jamba juice."

Oh.

-What's this?
-That's my bumper sticker.

-Your bumper sticker?
-Yeah, my ex wasn't
really a fan.

He kinda
said it was like

putting a bumper sticker
on a Bentley.

A Bentley? Well,
at least that's flattering.

Yeah, I guess,
if you like gas-guzzling,
status symbols,

then, sure, why not?

Somebody is
a spitfire today.

Well, maybe so.

-So, what's your deal?
-My deal?

Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're
on a dating site. Why?

I could ask you
the same question.

Avoidance,
that's fine.

Okay.
No particular reason.

I just haven't found
what I was looking for.

I want the kind
of relationship that
my parents have.

And up until now,
i didn't think I could
find that with anyone.

Okay, no. No.
Okay, that's like
the worst thing

that you could
do to a photographer.

You know what?
I could get used to
being around you.

You're kind of special.

Like this kind of special?

I think that is
a really good look for you.

You should start
doing that more often.

Thank you.
You know what?

My normal face doesn't
always work for me.

I think it's pretty great.

Do you want
to go back inside?

Okay.

Bienvenue
Ã¡ la Maison de Blair.

Bless you.

It means welcome
to the house of Blair.

This is my casbah.

I blame you for
the general clumsiness.

Moi? No, no, no, no, no.

-Why?
-'Cause you make me nervous.

Come on, let's go.

Slave driver.

Okay, you're gonna
hit the pull-up bars

I'm gonna grab us
some waters.

-Aye, aye, captain.
-All right.

I hate pull-ups.

Oh my god!
Can I pet him?

-Sure.
-Hi, corgi.

-This is nugget.
-Oh, I love corgis.

I follow, like,
60 on instagram.

-Oh, really?
-You should get one.

Maybe someday.

Your dog is awesome.
Thank you.

-Nice. Come on, buddy.
-Bye.

Have a nice day.

I thought you were
getting the waters.

Well, I didn't want to
interrupt you guys, you know.

Interrupt what?
I was just petting a dog.

Are you kidding?
Is this like,
a jealous joke?

Yeah. Gotcha.

I love you.

Yeah. I'm a little sweaty
though, so...

Right.

You know, Nora?

We live together, right?

So, maybe you
shouldn't be flirting

with all these
other guys all the time.

-Got it?
-Okay.

Well, that wasn't
part of the game plan.

I'm not complaining.

Leaving so soon?
I feel used.

Aren't we needy?
I'm just going to
the bathroom.

Well, then
you won't need this.

Maybe I'm shy?

You weren't so shy
five minutes ago.

Don't run into anything.

Excuse me,
having an emergency?

Something like that.

Hello, to you, too.
Miss me already?

Mmm, I can't.

Okay, I can't.
I can't.

I can't.

Okay, you broke
the box, seriously.

Just go with it.
It's a fantasy.

It's not mine.
Stop.

Blair, stop!

Stop.
Stop.

Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, please stop.

12 new messages.

Hi, sweetie. It's mom.

Spain is amazing,
maybe we'll stay.

So, how's the apartment
hunt going?

Call us and let us know
how you're doing, okay?

Enjoy the house.
Don't get too comfy.

Baby, where are you?

--Olivia, you got
a fucking restraining order.

--You bitch!

All your messages
have been erased.

Yeah, hi.
I need to report
a break-in.

Jesus.

F-- fuck!

What's wrong?

Your shit is literally
everywhere, okay?

I can't even take
a fucking piss without
tripping over your stuff.

I was looking
for something.

How many nail polishes
do you actually need?

As many as I want.
That's my stuff. Stop.

Oh, it's your stuff?
Well, it's my house.

-Finally, you said it.
-Yeah, yeah. I said it.

It's my house.

And you're just--
you're just a fucking guest.

Hello? Are you okay?

Yeah, I can do that.

-Can we just continue this--
-yeah, later.

-Okay, okay.
-I still need to piss.

Okay,
I'll be right there.

-Just--
-ugh, god.

â™ª I can feel it comin'
around again â™ª

â™ª creepin' around the bend â™ª

â™ª thinkin' I was scot-free
it was lookin' for me â™ª

â™ª don't let nobody in â™ª

â™ª go down
like that again... â™ª

What the hell
is going on?

He was here.

In this house.

In my parents' house.

Ugh, creepy.
Good thing they're not here.

He didn't know that.

I came home,

and this was open
to our wedding day,

he burned a cigarette
in my face.

I'm gonna stay here
with you tonight.

-You don't have to do that--
-no, things are really rough
with Ryan and I right now.

Is it okay if i
spend the night with you?

Like old times.

Yeah.

Coffee! Oop.

How'd you sleep?

Okay. You?

Um, amazing.

I'm pretty much just gonna
hide your mom somewhere
in your backyard,

and live in her
pajamas forever.

--Your dad won't notice.

I have 17 messages
from Adam.

Hmm.
Only 17 today.

Yeah, but still
nothing from Darcy.

She did go on that date
with Mr. wonderful yesterday.

Maybe it's one of those
dates that never ends.

True, but there's
something off about it.

I don't know,
I'm getting worried.

Don't. Worrying
creates those frown lines,

and you do not want those.

Oh my god,
I'm gonna be late for work,

I have to get ready.

-Oh, thank you so much
for staying, I love you.
-Love you.

-Let me know if you hear
from Darcy, okay?
-Okay.

Thank you.

Clearly, I will not be
applying to be a barista.

Staff meeting's in five.
Are you coming?

Oh. Your
divorce papers came.

It would appear so.

Don't worry.
Marriage is an antiquated
institution, anyway.

Excuse me?

You're a person,
not chattel.

You're not meant
to be owned.

-How old is Adam?
-35.

Way too old.

The world is full
of gorgeous young men

who are very eager
to please.

Really?

Look at you,
you're gorgeous.

You deserve
to be worshipped.

I don't know, I just--

let me show you
Javier, my cub.

He's 26.

When he rolls his "r's,"
you can't even believe it.

It sounds like
he's purring.

Not that one,.

Not that one, either.

â™ª Oh, uh, oh â™ª

â™ª oh, uh, oh â™ª

This is impossible.

Hey, you.

Shit.

-Are you ready?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

-You're kidding me.
-Oh, I completely forgot.

I-- I set this interview
up for you like a month ago.

Okay, we've got
like, 5 minutes.

I'm honestly not even
close to being ready.

I don't have my resume,
we don't even have paper
to print it on.

Okay, so, so
what am I supposed
to tell them?

Okay, because
this was a favor for me.

Tell them I came down
with something.

With this much notice?

Food poisoning?

Did you just get
your hair done?

-You noticed.
-No, no, no. Don't.

Look, I put my ass
on the line for you,
all right?

With a client of mine,
so that you could
get an interview,

and you forget,
because you're getting
your hair done.

Ugh! Hey.

Don't be angry.

I'm not angry,
all right, I'm-- I'm just--

I'm disappointed.

Do you have her spare key?

No, we drove all the way here,
and I forgot her spare key.

Because that isn't totally
something you would do?

Maybe she's dead.

Don't even say
shit like that.

We haven't heard
from her in two days.

Lighten up, warden.

-We never go two days.
-You're starting to sound
like my mother.

Oh, who would call
the police

after not hearing from you
in one day?

And see how tedious
that gets?

â™ª One of these days â™ª

â™ª the love I gave you â™ª

â™ª is gonna turn... â™ª

-Ooh, spooky.
-â™ª all of those good
warm feelings â™ª

Darce? Darcy?

I swear to god,
if you jump out
and scare me...

â™ª And you're gonna cry... â™ª

Darcy?

Darcy?

--It's okay,
it's just us.

Darcy, are you okay?

No, no, no.
We're getting up
and going to breakfast.

Go get in the shower.

Shower, now.
You stink.

Rude!

â™ª And you're gonna cry â™ª

â™ª like a baby, baby â™ª

â™ª cry â™ª

â™ª like a newborn child... â™ª

â™ª I wish that I could tell you
it isn't gonna hurt... â™ª

What do you think
happened to her?

Nothing good.

â™ª And still â™ª

â™ª you're gonna cry â™ª

â™ª like a baby, baby... â™ª

So they drive me
to the waffle house,

where my ex's girlfriend
is forced to wait on us.

That's usually
good for a laugh.

What can I get you?

-Coffee.
-You're not just
having coffee.

Coffee, black,
like my soul.

I didn't know
we decided to be emo
this morning.

Um, we're both gonna
have bacon and eggs,

over easy, with
a side of toast.

-And then for the toast,
can you do wheat?
-Yeah.

And slightly toasted,

so, not lightly,
slightly.

And um,
a side of butter.

What kind of butter
do you have?

Excuse me?
-No, I mean, is it salted,

or unsalted?
-It's a diner.

So, salted butter?
-Sure.

-Okay, no butter, then.
-Okay.

Can I have the big
deluxe breakfast,

-with an extra
side of bacon?
-Got it.

And the bacon--
could I have it like,
a chewy,

-not super crispy?
-Chewy, not super crispy.

She's definitely going to
spit in our food this time.

Um, we'd also like
separate checks.

Of course you would.

Okay, what is going on?

I don't wanna talk
about it.

You have to talk about it.

You spend two days
in the same clothes,

I don't see how my
personal hygiene choices

have any impact on you.

When you smell
like you did,

you obviously have
something going on.

So just tell us what it is,
and maybe we can help you,

-that's why we're here.
-You know, I'm not gonna
do this with you.

Jesus, Liv.

I come in peace.

You're here
to interrogate me?

No, but, she's
right, right?

Here we go.

Just say it super quick.

Like ripping
off a band-aid.

Boom, done, go.

And, go!

I can't look at you.

This is harsh.

We did it.

Blair and I.

And this
is a bad thing?

Then he forced me
to do it again.

You're saying
he raped you?

I guess in theory,
that's the correct
terminology.

Tell me what happened.

Everything was fine,

then I got up to
go to the bathroom,

and i-- I said no,
and he did it anyway.

Are you kidding me?

I'm sorry, I know
i can be pushy sometimes--

-he raped her!
-Please, share it
with the world.

-I'm not the world.
-Yeah, I know.

But can we please
not phrase it like that?

Sorry, but how else
do you want that phrased?

I don't know.
Maybe I misunderstood.

Or maybe he misunderstood
the meaning of the word, "no."

Um, yeah, just a second.
We're leaving.

We could go to the cops.

Do I get to be a part
of this decision?

Well, we should
report this.

-Do you want to call,
or should I?
-Hello?

I'll do it.
Okay, I'm sorry--

what do you think you're
gonna tell them?

"Oh, hi, officer,
my friend was raped by the guy
that she was seeing.

Proof? Oh wait,
there isn't any,

because not only
did she shower,

but she had sex
with him prior.

Oh, and it happened
two days ago."

It's a good one.
You should go for it.

-Shit.
-Yeah, case closed.

Conversation done.
Commence moving on.

You should have
told us that

before I threw you
into the shower.

It wouldn't have
made a difference,

would it have
mattered anyway?

How do you prove that
you were raped by a guy

that you've already
had sex with?

Hello? No, it's just
me and the girls.

Oh, my god,
seriously?

They wouldn't
have believed me.

It wouldn't have
hurt to try.

It wouldn't
have hurt you.

I know I push you
sometimes, but,

it's just because
i care about you,

and I want
you to be protected.

I want him to know
what it feels like,

to just like
walk out into a world,

and like,
not feel safe anywhere.

-Shh.
-What'd I miss?

I want him to pay.

-Calling the cops.
-No.

So, not calling the cops.

No, we know
how useless they can be.

We're gonna
do it ourselves.

Ooh, diy project.

What the fuck do you mean,
"do it ourselves"?

I want to make him feel
the way that I feel now.

What do you propose?

Let's just give him
what he gave me.

And then
he'll never forget.

â™ª Hey boyz,
i got magic â™ª

â™ª you got talent â™ª

â™ª we can take over
the world in a second â™ª

â™ª that's sweeter than honey â™ª

â™ª come on, Sonny â™ª

â™ª we can make it
if we try â™ª

â™ª damn, boyz, we you gotta
be moving fast â™ª

â™ª 'cause you're
blocking traffic â™ª

â™ª and we're about to go
on the mainstream radio â™ª

â™ª these days you gotta
be moving fast â™ª

â™ª sippin' up
speed crazies â™ª

â™ª 'cause we are
here about to â™ª

â™ª lose control.. â™ª

Leaving soon.

I hope you're not planning
on going out like that.

I hope that's not you
implying I should change.

Nope, not at all.

I just wasn't aware that
was the type of attention

you were looking
to attract when you go out.

It's just a dress, Ryan.
-If you say so.

If you think
i look good,

you could try
paying me a compliment

instead of
suggesting I change.

You don't look good.
You look cheap.

Fuck you.

You don't get to talk
to me like that,

I'm just trying
to have a life.

Okay, you know,
you act really righteous

for someone who just lost
their job over donuts.

You're a real activist.

Just remember
who's footing the bill

for your so-called life.

When did you become
such a small person?

â™ª Blow the house down â™ª

â™ª from the front row â™ª

â™ª I got magic â™ª

â™ª you got talent... â™ª

â™ª We can take over
the world in a second... â™ª

You drive.

Oh, by all means, honk.
Alert the entire neighborhood.

Covert operation
in progress.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-Let's ride.
-Yeah.

Can you make it quick?

I don't want to be
sitting in a parked car

in a dark alley like
a drug dealer all night.

You got it.

â™ª You're still here... â™ª

Damn, look at you.

-Lookin' good.
-Thank you, David.

You make me want to sing
Stevie wonder songs.

Give me a twirl,
give me a twirl.

Mmm! Make me
make my angry face.

Get in there.

Aw, you are a sweet,
sweet, man.

"You are a sweet,
sweet, man."

Well, he is.

Drooling all over you.

Just go find Blair.

â™ª Rushing through
the trees â™ª

â™ª you're every breath
that I breathe... â™ª

â™ª ...available to you â™ª

â™ª till now,
it was never real... â™ª

â™ª I wish you'd die â™ª

â™ª fuckin' wish you'd die â™ª

â™ª die, die, die,
motherfucker die... â™ª

â™ª It's all I think about â™ª

â™ª the dream
that keeps me awake â™ª

â™ª it won't let me go
it's everyday... â™ª

Hey.

My names jue.
That's spelled j-u-e.

Not j-e-w.

What's your name?

That's really
what you're gonna go with?

Hey!

â™ª Oh revenge,
it is so sweet â™ª

â™ª so I called you up,
said, "hey babe, let's meet" â™ª

â™ª "i need a taste
of your sweet meat" â™ª

â™ª when you got there I tied up
your hands and your feet â™ª

â™ª and when you say "no" â™ª

â™ª I'll say
"i don't think so..." â™ª

Hey!

Do you mind?

Oops, I'm--
I'm sorry.

â™ª You have played
right in my hands â™ª

â™ª now I'm gonna
make you understand... â™ª

â™ª And today
ain't fading fast â™ª

â™ª but I know it won't last â™ª

â™ª watch these walls
fall away, away, away... â™ª

-Oh, oh my god.
-Oh,no.

I'm so
horrifically sorry.

-God that...
-Bitch.

Yeah, that and a medley
of other colorful words.

Here, let me, um...

Oh, no, thanks,
i-- I got it. I got it.

I got it. Thanks.

God,
i am terrible in crowds.

-Excuse me, what is--
-she is about to tell him

that he is going
to be a daddy, again.

I can't imagine you
being terrible anywhere.

Aren't you suave?

How about I buy
you a drink?

Why not?
Um, I'll have another beer.

You got it, babe. One beer.

-So, let's play a game.
-I like games.

How about you
guess how many months
I've been single,

and if you're right,
I'll chug my beer,

if you're wrong,

you have to take
a shot for every month
I've been single.

You've got a deal.

I think you're
gonna regret that.

I hope so.

Carlos, could you
line up some glasses?

Thanks.

You know, I could get used
to being around you.

You're kinda special.

Well, save the charm.
And take a guess, sir.

Three months.

Way wrong.

Three shots
of Tequila, please.

Here's to spilt beer.

â™ª Keep walking
when you lose hope...â™ª

â™ª keep walking
stand up... â™ª

Did it work?
It didn't, did it?

He's not into her.

Oh, no,
he's into her.

It's the greatest accidental
first date I've seen.

Yeah. He's good with firsts--
first dates, first kisses,

first rapes.

We're ready.
Are you good to go?

Yeah. Coming now.

Somebody rebounds fast.

Special, my ass.

â™ª Keep walking,
stand up re-load... â™ª

â™ª Keep walkin'... â™ª

So, what do you say?
You wanna get out of here?

-We can get a ride to--
-my place?

Yeah.

Let's go.

Make sure you get
that one home safe.

Aw, leaving so soon?

I know. Girls night
has to continue elsewhere.

-All right.
-Thank you.

Always a pleasure.

The plan was simple.

Dump him in the desert
without his clothes,

so he had to hitch
back to town naked.

It's official--
my ass is going numb.

This is obviously
the unglamorous part
of this mission.

I went from bond girl
to babysitter.

Do we have an e.T.A.
On our mystery destination?

Yeah-- soon.

Are you seriously eating
nutty nutters right now?

Hoe-ing makes her hungry,

a mission
of this magnitude,

requires snacks.

Okay, focus on
the task at hand.

This culinary delight
that I am currently consuming

is for the benefit
of this group.

So I can be
a fully functioning--

okay, can't--
can't breathe, can't move.

Blair. Can't move.

This is officially
not sexy, or funny.

Ugh,
i can't breathe.

If you can yell,
you can definitely breathe.

Just help her.

Ugh.

You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

Sit him upright.

It's not like
he's light.

-Use your softball arms.
-Hey, Nora just shut up
and do it.

Shit.

License
and registration?

Thanks.

You know why
i pulled you over?

You were
swerving slightly.

Really?

-Have you been drinking?
-No.

-You sure?
-Positive.

Where you all
coming from?

Barmaggedon.

But you weren't
drinking at this bar?

I drove to pick up
my drunk miscreant friends.

This true?
-Nutty nutters
taste like peanut butters!

I can't.

One and done,
they taste so fun.

How about that?
It's better than crack.

I really can't--
I'm allergic.

Bummer!

I might need to ask you
to step out of the car.

-Are you kidding?
-Nope.

Oh, my god.

Now, if you can please
walk into a straight line

towards me.

-Really?
-Yes, ma'am.

And, turn around
and walk back.

Stand with
your feet together.

Lift your right foot.

Feet back together.

Now, tilt your head back,
close your eyes,

touch your nose with
your right index finger.

Ma'am, that's not
your index finger.

Okay, quite frankly,
I'm feeling slightly harassed.

I attempt to keep some drunk
citizens off the street,

and this is how
i get repaid,

perhaps I should have
just let them mow down
a couple pedestrians.

Recite the alphabet
backwards.

Okay, you wanna know?
I can't do that.

And only a drunk person
would even attempt that.

This does not qualify
as flying under the radar.

At least
she is actually sober.

What happened?

We traded numbers.
-Playa, playa.

Oh, my god.

Still got it.

-Okay, can you not?
-Can you stop, please?

--Do not wave!

Do not.

-Nora.
-Yes, sir?

-Why won't the car start?
-I don't know.

I don't know.
You're the one driving.

How long has
that light been on?

I think, like,
a couple months.

You've had your "check engine"
light on for a couple months?

How am I supposed to know
it's a "check engine" light?

--What?

It's not like
anyone tells you

what any of those
lights mean.

Okay, what now?

Abandon ship?

Um, we are not leaving my car
on the side of the road.

Sometimes it just needs
a couple minutes to cool down.

-A couple?
-Like, 20.

You're right-- let's sit
on the side of the road

until he wakes up,
or we find a tow?

-Fine.
-Let's just get him out
and set him up here.

Oh, my god,

-give me first.
-Oh no, please continue to text.

-Okay.
-Watch his penis.

-Or we get under.
-Do you have him?

I'm under.

Okay.

This won't attract
any attention.

We already
got pulled over.

I think we're through
the worst of it.

It's not the desert,
but it'll do.

I think we're safe
in the middle of nowhere.

You look marvelous.

-Wait--
-Jesus, Nora,

it looks like a 500 pound
computer programmer

lives in your trunk.

The last accent piece.

"I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. demille."

Lovely,
he looks like he can hit

"the man hole"
when we're finished.

I do what I can.

Guess I don't have
to go to the gym
for the next week.

Yeah, well, but
you're not toning
your arms.

What is it with you guys
and the arm jokes and me?

-Oh, come on.
-I want an apology.

-Oh, he's bucking.
-Oh, oh, hey, whoa.

What the fuck?

And he's out.

I thought I was
the clumsy one.

Don't you dare
answer that.

I don't want to.
It's probably just Ryan.

Should we just,
do it here?

It's not gonna get him
on the sex offenders
registry or anything.

I could settle for
humiliation and dusty nuts.

That'll be the title
of his autobiography.

"Dusty nuts."

I think he's out.
We could pretty much do
anything we want to him.

I say we brand him.

Do you happen
to have a branding iron

in your trunk,
as well?

I'm not above etching,
"rapist" on his stomach.

No, let's stick
to the plan.

I would rather
not add assault and battery

to the list,
with kidnapping.

Do you have
the scissors?

What are you
gonna do with them?

Cut his clothes off.

If we're gonna make him
hitch back naked

in sunglasses
and a feather boa,

he needs to be naked.

We're not going to
physically undress him

I don't need to reminisce.

I'm just gonna cut
his clothes off.

Well, I forgot them.

Okay, just sit him up, and
i will take his clothes off.

Oh, god.
-What, what?

Oh, just--
come here.

Oh, god.
What now?

I don't think we're
gonna have to worry

about humiliating
him anymore.

God.

Okay, this can't
be happening.

-Is he breathing?
-Yeah.

Maybe through the giant hole
in the center of his face.

So, he's dead?
Like, dead, dead?

What other kind is there?

Dead is a pretty
definitive word to use.

See, this is why
i don't online date.

It's too much work.

God, can Ryan
take a hint?

Psychotic, much?

Okay, we are standing
over the dead body of
your last date,

so you should probably
not start with me.

So, we're not worried that
he's a tad possessive?

He gets worried about me.

Yeah, I bet
he's real concerned
about your welfare.

You don't know how he is.

All the good
stuff he does.

Right, we don't,
so tell us.

He's been supporting me
since I lost my job.

You lost your job?

Okay, we have more pressing
issues than my love life,

and employment status.

I don't think
he's going anywhere.

We are corpse adjacent.
Dead jokes are not funny.

Okay, please,
i would love for you
to keep yelling

so the cops
can find us again.

No!
-Ew! This can't be happening.

Nora?
Are you cracking?

Is this you cracking?

If I did, would you
kill me, too?

-No.
-Okay, what is going on?

My shoes.

There's blood
on my shoes, gross.

Then stop
touching everything.

It is everywhere.

Okay--
we're gonna be fine.

Everything
is going to be okay.

I have to go.

I have to get
my shoe cleaner.

Ridiculous.

Get his I.D.

I'm sorry
I'm not fucking sorry.

â™ª I missed the flight â™ª

â™ª to neverland â™ª

â™ª but Peter you miss
so much of me â™ª

â™ª I missed the flight â™ª

â™ª to neverland... â™ª

For the first time ever,

we were briefly
speechless.

I didn't care
that he was dead.

In fact, it seemed
like the universe's way
of serving justice.

â™ª ...i missed the flight â™ª

â™ª to neverland... â™ª

What about Blair?

We'll say
it was a mafia hit.

No, like seriously.

He's random guy without
i.D. In the middle of nowhere.

By the time the animals
are done with him,

he'll only be recognizable
through dental records.

Too bad we couldn't
have taken Adam out
at the same time.

-What?
-No, it's just--

I feel like whenever
we start talking about him,

is when he shows up.

Its like he has
a radar for it,

and we definitely do not
need him showing up tonight.

Amen to that.

Do you ever miss him?

How could I miss him?
He's always lurking around.

-I'll go grab my stuff.
-Okay.

I'll be really quick.

I need a shoe cleaner, stat!

Oh, where are you at?

Eureka!

I have found it.

Please,
please, please.

If there is a god.

-What are you doing?
-Oh, fuck!

Uh, I stained my shoes.

How'd you do that?

Some cow in leopard print
spilled a vodka cran on them.

Hag.

-What?
-You're so good at lying,
it scares me.

What are you talking about?

I know where
you were tonight.

I know what you did.

What I did?

What about
what she did?

I mean, hit your mouth,
sister.

Exhibit a.

Looks like you had
a bloody good time, mate.

She should just
give it up.

Blood doesn't
come out of anything.

This one time,

Adam fell and cut
himself in the kitchen,

I mean, it was after
he punched me,

so part of me
just wanted

to let him bleed out
all over the place,

like a stuck pig.

But I didn't.

Anyway, in the process,
he bled all over everything,

he even stained
the kitchen counter.

I could never
get it out.

God, that was
the sweetest bedtime story.

--Please, tell it again.

I have so many
stories like that.

Why didn't
you ever tell me?

It's not something
you talk about.

Not even to your friends?

Especially not
to your friends.

I think you're overreacting
just a little.

I know I didn't
answer my phone,

no, that's the thing--
you did.

Now I'm confused.
Have you been drinking?

-I heard the whole thing.
-You heard what?

What are you even
talking about?

Okay, you want to know
what i-- look.

You butt-answered.

Now do you want
to talk about it?

I actually don't.
I have to go,

and I have no idea
what you're talking about.

You've really been drinking
and you are paranoid.

No. Look, you're
not going anywhere.

Like hell I'm not.

I think I'm gonna
go check on her.

-Tell her to hurry up.
-You're coming with me.

We're just
gonna find her

psychotically
scrubbing her shoes.

At the very least,
we'll hurry her up.

If we can pry them
out of her hands.

Shh.

Someone needs
to have a garage sale.

Yeah.

Shh, shh.

You're acting like a child.

Good, then you won't
mind if I leave.

What-- so, where are
you gonna go, then?

Oh, because being here
is such a delight,

why wouldn't
i want to stay?

-So, why have you stayed?
-You're such an ass.

No, answer
the fucking question!

Because I love you!

Wait, then,
why are you leaving me?

Clearly, this is over.

Okay, but, if you
just talk to me--

okay, that's the point--
i can't talk to you anymore.

So what, are you gonna
leave with the girls?
That's fucking rich.

You don't accept me.
They do.

I'm still the same person.
You're the one who's changed.

That's because
the circumstances
have changed, okay?

-No, you have to adapt.
-No, actually, I don't.

-They don't need me to change.
-Nora, listen to yourself.

You're being
fucking ridiculous.

-I'm leaving.
-No, no, you're not.

Okay, look,
if you walk out,

I will ruin all of you.

Oh f--
oh, god,

oh, that's great.
Yeah, welcome. Yeah.

Nora, we have to go.

Yeah, no you're not.
No one's going anywhere.

Give her back her bag.

No, it's my bag.
I paid for it.

-It was a gift.
-Well, I'm taking
it back, anyway.

Ugh! Let go!

Over my dead body.

All right, then.

Ryan?

Oh, my god.

You know, I hope you're
intending on replacing that.

Ryan, you have--

what the fuck?

No.

So, this is bad.

-What do we do?
-Nothing.

His mother comes
to clean tomorrow.

His mother cleans
your house?

-What do you do?
-Apparently, not enough.

Uh, my bag.

You drive.

It dawned on me--

maybe we were better off
without men in our lives.

I knew Nora would be
happier without Ryan.

You okay up there?

-Do you think
she's gonna be okay?
-Probably.

You guys can stop talking
about me like I'm not here.

You could start responding
like you are here.

Jesus,
spit it out, Nora!

Typical Ryan.

He never
fucking listened.

I'm just bummed.

"Bummed" is really the word
you're gonna go with?

I know it's stupid.

It's not stupid at all.

I just really loved
those shoes.

Now I'm gonna be
homeless and single,

and have bad footwear.

-What the fuck?
-My parents are going
to be so pissed.

Are you gonna
call the cops?

And where am I gonna tell
them I was while my place
was being trashed?

I can think of an easy
solution to that problem.

Easy being a relative term,

but it's probably
more convenient than
redecorating

every time your ex
throws a hissy fit.

I'm listening.

If you think about it,
he's really kind of
a loose end.

Lurking about,
and whatnot.

What the fuck
is happening here?

We're gonna kill Adam.

She's kidding.

No, she wasn't.

Well...

We said we'd be all in
in the beginning of the night,

so, I'm in.

Yes.

But seriously,
can we please get food first?

Homicide
makes me hungry.

Protecting Olivia
just made sense.

I smell bacon.

I would literally
stab someone

for pancakes
right now.

Does tonight work
for everybody?

Oh god, everyone
is just a little too
overstimulated right now.

You'd think
i would be the one

who would be
the most excited
about this.

I'm a passionate person.
I'm committed to the cause.

I'll say.

Hello? Yes.

Something
happened to Ryan?

Okay. I'll be
right there.

Something happened
to Ryan.

Shocker.

I just want bacon to go.

Okay, do you have
your story straight?

Yeah. I was with
you guys all night.

And doing what?

Watching a movie.
-What movie?

-What do you got?
-"Clueless."

Watching "clueless."
-What else?

Jesus fucking Christ,
we're watching, "clueless,"

eating stir fry
and chocolate ice cream

and braiding
each other's hair.

And laughing at guys
on tinder all night.

-Better?
-Much.

We can't have
any holes in our story,

or loose ends.

Sad, sad. Be sad.

Wait-- the shoes.

-Think about the shoes.
-See you tonight.

Yeah we should probably
share a car ride, nose goes.

Oh!

Oh come on, not it!

I drove last time.

Are we seriously organizing
a murder carpool right now?

Oh my god,
if you cry over that cereal.

â™ª And payback
is a bitch â™ª

â™ª yeah... â™ª

â™ª Old man rum
got you wise â™ª

â™ª since falling
the last time â™ª

â™ª bat your cinnamon eyes â™ª

â™ª slide
to the far side â™ª

â™ª you'll only come close â™ª

â™ª close enough to look â™ª

â™ª but I liked you better
when you weren't so good â™ª

â™ª you look
ripe to be picked â™ª

â™ª and forbidden
to lick though â™ª

â™ª like some apple outlawed â™ª

â™ª unfit for the wrong god â™ª

â™ª won't bring a thing
but trouble to my room â™ª

â™ª but I like
my trouble with â™ª

â™ª va va voom â™ª

â™ª so come on in,
darling â™ª

â™ª don't you resist me â™ª

â™ª the more you dismiss me â™ª

â™ª the devil don't mind â™ª

â™ª and what would she say â™ª

â™ª if only she knew, love â™ª

â™ª how you stumbled my way... â™ª

--Ah! Oh, my god!

How is it possible
that you are late for
literally everything?

I told you
we should have carpooled.

What? I had to shower
after my interrogation.

Wouldn't it have made
more sense for you
to shower after this?

Right.
Make me the errand bitch

and then criticize me
for everything.

Okay, let's do this.
I still have my spare key.

We're going
in the back door.

â™ª Let's cut to the chase â™ª

â™ª we both know
this was only for you... â™ª

No, he's not
supposed to be home,

I don't want the neighbors
noticing the lights on.

All right,
mood lighting it is.

I prefer the cover
of darkness, anyways.

This is such
a nice place.

I miss it.

-Why didn't you kick him out?
-Too many memories.

And the grout in the kitchen
is stained.

--Shh.

â™ª You're creeping â™ª

â™ª going around like
a creature of the night... â™ª

-Sleepy time.
-Yes.

â™ª Hope my mama doesn't find
out what I'm doing â™ª

â™ª at night with you â™ª

â™ª mm-mm â™ª

--What the fuck?

Hello?

Oh, Liv...

This is so romantic.

Surprised?

-Come to apologize?
-For what?

You were the one who
trashed my parents house.

You served me
with divorce papers.

So?

It hurt my feelings.

I'm not seeing
the correlation.

Oh--

oh, baby,
you look tired.

Did you have
too much to drink?

Well, it wouldn't
be the first time.

Here. Shh.

I want you to know,
that what's about
to happen to you,

is all your fault.

"Dear Olivia..."

Words cannot begin
to express the depths

of my sorrow..."

I didn't write that.

You know,
it is so rude
to interrupt.

Especially when
I'm reading your
last words.

If you're not gonna pay
attention, then why bother?

No more reading
before bedtime for you.

Bummer. Spoiler alert--
it was kind of poetic.

Quite frankly,
i think it makes you sound

more intelligent
than you are.

-Why?
-Because black widows
eat their mates.

Since I know
you like it rough, babe.

--Is that a text message?

Uh, yeah,
the cop.

Is he asking you out?

Let's hope not
for his sake.

"How about dinner
tomorrow night?"

Here's
to new beginnings.

Oh my god,
i have a great idea
for my new job.

I could do
crime scene clean-up.

You could pimp me out
to your new boyfriend.

I-- I'm not gonna be
pimping you out to anyone.

I'm pretty sure
you're better at
creating the mess,

than you are at
cleaning it up.

Oh, you can't get
it in your mouth?

I'm careful
when it counts.

But feeding
doesn't qualify?

I blame you.
-Mm-hmm.

You're just
so intimidating.

I'm eating with
a man of the law.

-I understand.
-We'll be having desserts

-in a moment.
-Oh thank you.

You're welcome.

Look, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

Did you know the guy
in the back of your car

the night
i pulled you over?

-The guy in the back
of the car...
-Yeah.

Not really.

Nora always makes
the strangest friends
at the bar.

Doesn't Nora
have a boyfriend?

She was in the station
yesterday about him.

Will you excuse me?
I just have to...

Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
jump into work,

-i just--
-no, it's-- it's fine.

I'll be right back.

-Excuse me.
-Can I help you
with something?

Is there any way
that I could change my order?

Women can be so fickle.

Thank you.

Chivalry isn't dead.

-I hope not.
-For you, miss.
And for you, sir.

-Thank you, sir.
-Please enjoy.

Mmm.

Would you like to
try some of mine?

Wow, a man who's willing
to share his dessert.

That is an
admirable quality.

Mmm.

That tastes like heaven.

Would you like to get
a drink after this?

See, you already
want to spend

the rest of your life
with me.

I don't know if I could handle
the sarcasm for that long.

Now this...
Is to die for.

You gonna let me
try some of it?

You know, I don't know
if I can even part with
a bite of this.

Hmm.
-It's very difficult for me.

Fine. Open wide.

I'm kinda nuts
about you.

Nutty nutters,
taste like peanut butters.

I really can't.
I'm allergic.

I really was having
a great time.

â™ª What a beautiful
sister... â™ª

And we all lived
happily ever after.

Bummer.

Nora finally got
her dream job,

donuts included.

Oh, my god.

â™ª I have been crying â™ª

â™ª with blood in my hands â™ª

â™ª his eyes are now buried â™ª

â™ª beneath all the sand â™ª

â™ª so now he can see â™ª

â™ª when I lie on the stand â™ª

â™ª well that's what I do â™ª

â™ª to protect my friends... â™ª

--There's my girl.
What's so funny?

Olivia found love,

just not with a cub.

--I love your friends.

â™ª And trap me
with anger â™ª

â™ª and grief
in this hole â™ª

â™ª I'm buried alive â™ª

â™ª and I've lost
all control â™ª

â™ª but that's what I do
to protect my friends â™ª

â™ª I've got time
on my hands... â™ª

And me? I got
some killer cheesecake.

â™ª With his blood
on my hands â™ª

â™ª cleaned up
the mess now â™ª

â™ª and I've started
to think â™ª

â™ª how do you smell so good â™ª

â™ª when the stench
of you stinks â™ª

â™ª so I breathe
and wonder â™ª

â™ª as I sleep
on my dreads â™ª

â™ª but that's what I do
to protect my friends â™ª

â™ª I've got time
on my hands â™ª

â™ª I got time â™ª

â™ª with his blood
on my hands â™ª

â™ª I got time
on my hands â™ª

â™ª I've got time â™ª

â™ª with his blood
on my hands â™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª I have been crying â™ª

â™ª with blood
in my hands â™ª

â™ª his eyes
are now buried â™ª

â™ª beneath all that sand â™ª

â™ª so now he can see â™ª

â™ª when I cry on the stand â™ª

â™ª well that's what
i did to protect my friends â™ª

â™ª I've got time
on my hands â™ª

â™ª with his blood
on my hands â™ª

â™ª time on my hands â™ª

â™ª I got time â™ª

â™ª with his blood
on my hands â™ª

â™ª I've got blood â™ª

â™ª I've got blood
on my â™ª

â™ª ooh â™ª

â™ª blood on my â™ª

â™ª I've got blood
on my hands. â™ª
