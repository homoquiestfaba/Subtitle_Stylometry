[mysterious music playing]

Morning, Mr. Chapin.

Busy day, Jessica.

No time to lie in bed.

Man, you are early.

[birds chirping]


you'â€™re not really asleep.

Yes, I am.

We have to be at the office
in ten minutes.[singing]

I'â€™m taking a sick day.

Tell the boss
I'â€™ve got malaria.

I'â€™m the boss and so are you.

Mmm, I keep forgetting

whose idea was to start
this business anyway?

My love, today is Thursday.

What starts tomorrow?

Oh, yes! [whispers]

Ten days with no phones,

-no faxes, no beepers.
-[Jessica] No faxes, no beepers.

I promise.

You promise it won'â€™t be
fives years before our
next vacation.

You'â€™re sorry
you married a working man?

Absolutely.

I'â€™m getting dressed.

[ominous music playing]

[motor whirring]

[tires screeching]

[radio chatter]

Shouldn'â€™t you be back
at the office doing paper work?

Well I heard the call.
I was passing by.
Do you mind?

Not at all.

I can always use the voice
of experience. Right?

Listen, I when we got married

I said I'â€™d stay out
of you cases but--

is Catharine Dobson.

She'â€™s been missing
about three hours.

Doesn'â€™t look like
she met a friend. Does it?

Morning shift
should be in by now.

Maybe they can... dispatch can
pull some bodies for...

house to house.

[indistinct conversation]


Good morning, Michael.

[car sputtering]

[suspenseful music playing]


Sergeant Meyer, call dispatch.

Tell them to pull everyone
they can get them down here.


I want a grid search
of the entire neighborhood.

Tell them first uh,
I want to talk
the old lady'â€™s kids, whoever.

And I need a sector map now.

someone'â€™s got her?

Let'â€™s just get moving all right?

to Chicago.

Jack'â€™s got a flat tire.

Thanks.

Hey, Bob, do you think
in between bites on that donut,

you can let me know
when Sid gets here?

Mr. Lowenstein
asked for him specifically.

Yes, boss.

Hey, buddy,
you look a little stressed.

I don'â€™t believe in stress.

are all down,

we didn'â€™t even lose
that much money.

Frank, you'â€™re a prince.

You know it.


Where would he take her?
To his house?


go too far with her in the car.

-Right?
-Hm-mm.

some place close,
some place private.

The river.

of woods up there,

it'â€™s pretty thick
this time of the year.

Nice and private.

[indistinct chattering]

[suspenseful music playing]

We need twice as many men
to cover this area.

we got blood here.

Took two steps
and there it was.

There'â€™s no trail.
Just a few drops.

Is it human?

for an injured rabbit.

Sergeant, let'â€™s focus
the search here.

Line them up along this path.

And then walk them
straight back into the woods.

We'â€™re running out of time.

Fall in. Fall in

in a straight line.

Fan out 20 meters
on either side of me. Okay?

spread out, spread out.

So that I don'â€™t want you
to miss anything, all right?

You can take it over here,
straight back.

[eerie music playing]

Beth.

She'â€™s right here.

[intense music playing]


She was stabbed and strangled.

I can'â€™t say yet
which killed her.

And it looks as if she
was raped as well.


Call me when you know,
all right?


Let'â€™s go tell the parents.

No, I'â€™ll do that.

You stay here
and get on this thing.

All right?

Come on.

Let'â€™s get to work.

Well, Mr. Hardaway,
you are very welcome.

You work hard.
You just seem like a man
who needed

some base ball tickets.


No, thank you, Mr. Hardaway.

-Did he enjoy the game?
-You bet.

And next month 75
visiting insurance brokers

will be riding
a Rayner Limousines.

You are so lucky
you have me.

-A shameless manipulator.
-[chuckles]

It'â€™s five o'clock.

I have message
from the office staff.

[yells playfully]
Get out of here.

Nice respect from our employees.

We should fire them.

You can'â€™t fire me, I've known
you since you were three.

Oh, I have to call
Ron Baker at the bank.

-Crises is at seven
we keep looking at.
-I'â€™ll take care of it.

I got Jack stuck in Chicago.

-Mr. Wolenstine...
-Out.

[indistinct chatter
and clapping]

You'â€™re gonna take care of it.

about you.

-[girl] Jessica.
-Hey, how'â€™re you doing?

Jessica, we were
catching caterpillar.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

So we almost missed you.

Trying to kick 'â€™em out.

Hey, Jessica, can I see inside
the limousines?

Sure you can, sweetheart.
Come with me.

So you'â€™ll bring in the mail
while we'â€™re gone?

Yeah, no problem. I just
came by to get the keys.

they'â€™re in there honey.

Did you hear
about Katie Dobson?

Someone killed her.

They found her body
at the river this morning.

Do they know who did it?

No idea. That'â€™s what
makes it so scary.


Went to school
with her mom.

Well, you guys picked
a good time to go out of town.

Yeah.

Got to go, have fun.

[pleasant music playing]

[fish-line whipping]

I'â€™m never gonna get this.

Yeah, it'â€™s beautiful.

I guess it doesn'â€™t matter
if I catch it.

[spring winding]


It'â€™s suppose
to be fun, remember.

You'â€™re doing great.


Did I get you?
Are you okay?

Okay.

I'â€™m the fish
you want to catch?


Hold on a second.


[fire rustling]

[Jessica sighs]

-Water is delicious.
-Yeah?

Listen, [clearing throat]
this is almost ready.

So we should think
about getting changed.

Okay.

[mellow music playing]


[mellow piano playing]

Wanna help?


[crickets chirping]

go if you'â€™re gonna go.

Right. Like my fish dinner
was interrupted if you...

-Carol forgot
to lock the door.
-Oh.

You sister is not
doing the job very well.

-We'â€™re gonna
have to cut her salary.
-[Jessica laughing]

Hey, Carol, you here?

-I'â€™ll call her.
-Go ahead.

[Dan sighing in exhaustion]

-[Dan] You'â€™re cooking.
-[Jessica chuckles]

Hi, we'â€™re home.

Oh, it was amazing.
Just perfect.

No. [chuckles]

Listen, did you happen
to leave the door unlocked?

Carol said she'â€™s positive
she locked up

and she'â€™s pretty good
about things like...

that.

Please tell me you did this.

of CDs, what else?

Oh, bottle of scotch.
Can you believe that?

Jess, I am so sorry.

-I could have sworn
I locked the door.
-No.

Carol, sergeant Meyer'â€™s said,
he came in through this window,

and out through
the front door.

I was supposed
to watch the house.

Oh, forget it.

He hardly took
anything anyway.

It'â€™s just weird.

Weird is right.

It'â€™s almost like he just wanted
to go through your things.

I'â€™m sure he was very bored.

Okay.

Everything upstairs is fine.

Do you have every thing
you need, sergeant?

Yes, sir, Mr. Rayner.

I'â€™ll put everything out
in the wire but

truthfully I wouldn'â€™t
be too optimistic.

You know,
could have been teenagers.

If you'â€™re gonna keep
the windows open,

you might wanna look
into getting an alarm.

Yeah, okay,
we'â€™ll think about it.
Thank you, sergeant.

[door closes]

That'â€™s wonderful.


and the police say,
get an alarm.

Just wonderful.

I do have to say
this guy was very tidy.

Little piles of clothes,

screen placed
neatly on the chair.

Your kind of burglar.

I'â€™m going to St. Louis
with Frank tomorrow night
for that meeting.

I think you should
stay at Carols.

Absolutely.

-I think it'â€™s a good idea.
-Dan, Dan, Dan, no.

She lives right up
the street,

it'â€™ll take four seconds
to get here.

Okay?

Now let'â€™s talk about dinner.
I'â€™m starving.

Let me help.

What did you mean
my kind of burglar?

[indistinct chattering]

I think I'â€™ll be heading out
to meet with Sandy

at five about buying
those stretch limos.

Don'â€™t just talk numbers
with Sandy.

We'â€™ll get a better deal
if he likes you.

Well I'â€™ll sweep him off his feet
and be home by midnight.

-Okay.
-Stretch limos,
can you believe it?

Two tycoons. That'â€™s us.

Look, honey, I know you
and Frank love those river boats

so if you wanna
stay overnight and gamble...

that'â€™s fine, okay?

-Stay and gamble?
Never crossed my mind.
-[chuckles]

Hey, you ready
to lose some money?

This was supposed
to be a business trip, remember?

Oh, yeah. What'â€™s it gonna be,
cracks or blackjack?

See you tomorrow.

Have fun.

[crickets chirping]

[ominous music playing]

[door clicks open]

[door creaking]

You'â€™re back?

[ominous music continues]

Dan?

Honey?

Dan?

Is that you?

[enthralling music playing]

[floorboard creaking]



Mr. Chapin! Mr. Chapin!


[dog barking]




[muffled cry]

No, no, no.

No, no, no...





[eerie music playing]


[breathing heavily]

[muffled cry]

You are beautiful.

You, are so beautiful.


[Mr. Chapin] Jessica?

[breathing heavily]

Jessica.
[exclaiming in horror]

Mr. Chapin. [mumbles]

Mr. Chapin...
[mumbling tearfully]

[woman over PA system]

Where is she?
Where'â€™s my wife?

-Mr. Rayner?
-Yeah.

-I'â€™m sorry.
-Is it bad? Is she alive?

She'â€™s alive.
Mr. Rayner is you could
just take a minute, please.

-Look, I want to see her.
-I'â€™m sorry, you can't.

-What do mean...
-Sir, your wife
has been assaulted.

I'â€™m here to make sure
she remains safe.

Now go to the waiting
area, Mr. Rayner!

-Please, I can'â€™t please.
-Let him go.

Go see Jessica.

He'â€™s sorry. Okay?
He'â€™s sorry.

Let me get you
a cup of coffee.

[somber music playing]

Jessie?


Did you win?

What happened?

Someone came into the house.

I was asleep.

I thought it was you.

I thought it was you.
[mumbles tearfully]


It'â€™s okay.

It'â€™s okay.

[indistinct chattering]

Greg Corning.

How are you?
I haven'â€™t seen you in years.

Hi, Frank, I'â€™m fine.

Little over-worked.

Anything you can do to to help
these people out,

I'â€™d appreciate it.
They'â€™re my family.

I'â€™ll make it
as easy as possible.

-Is she up for answering
some questions?
-Yeah.

You should go in.

Dan?

Danny?

Come on, buddy.

And I went to bed about 11:00.

All right.
About the attack...

this one thing
I have to ask you
straight away.

Were you sexually assaulted?

What?

We should do a rape kit
as soon as possible.

I don'â€™t know
I was kind of out of it.

She would remember
if that happened.

She did get a pretty good
knock in the head.

She would remember
something like that.

You don'â€™t need
a rape kit.

Dan I...

I think it'â€™s a good idea.

[camera flash clicks]
This won'â€™t be much longer
now, Jessica.

Just breath for me.
Take a deep breath.

-Okay.
-Just one more.

It'â€™s almost done.


Good.

Jessica, get dressed now.

baggy eyes

weak chin.

He was taller than me.
5'â€™10" maybe.

He had rough skin.

And he smelled.

You have a good eye, Jessica.

You should have been
a detective.

Maybe in my next life.

Hmm.

Okay, let'â€™s just go over
this again from the beginning.


You know this is totally
ridiculous, okay.

She'â€™s been over it
three times already.

Why aren'â€™t you out there
looking for this guy?

-Dan...
-Maybe you should
wait outside, Dan.

So that you can waste
some more time?

No. No, I think not.

All right, detective, time
is over.

[door shuts]

I'â€™m almost finished, doc.

Great.
Did I ask you a question?

now go, get.

[doctor chuckles]

You'â€™re the doc.
I'â€™ll see you tomorrow, Jessie.

came back negative.

That'â€™s a hard little
noggin you'â€™ve got up there.

[both laugh]

Let me take a peak.

[door slams]

Dan, he'â€™s just doing his job.

perfect.


I'â€™m gonna give you
something to help you sleep.

And Dan here
is going to go across
the street to Curlies diner

and get himself something
to eat besides coffee.

I recommend
the meat loaf sandwich

but then that'â€™s up to him.

I'â€™ll be right outside.
I promise.

[door clicks open]


Sent Carol home.
She'â€™s exhausted.
How is Jessica?

She'â€™s in the hospital, Frank.

She was raped.
How do you think
she is?

Greg said, she gave
a great description.

The jerk cop
wouldn'â€™t leave her alone.

She'â€™s exhausted.
Can'â€™t he tell that?

You want a cup of coffee?

No, I don'â€™t want
a cup of coffee.

Yeah, yeah, look I'â€™ll get it.

[woman over PA system]


Glad she'â€™s okay, Dan.

Well, if it isn'â€™t Sam Spade.

You just can'â€™t seem to leave.

I guess you'â€™re convinced
that this guy is some where
in the hospital.

Is that it?

Maybe he is.

There'â€™s few questions
I wanted to ask you.

[Dan sighs]

I told you,

I don'â€™t know anybody
who'â€™d do something like this.

Mm-hm.

[vending machine pops]

You were in St. Louis
the whole night.
That'â€™s what you said, right?

What are you getting at?

You think I did this?

To my own wife?

People do it everyday, Dan.

Even worse than this.

[woman over PA system]

-Where you going?
-I'â€™m gonna find this guy.

What are you talking about?
Do you know who he is?

No, but I know
what he looks like.

You know what the police know.
They'â€™re already looking.

I'â€™m afraid the police
don'â€™t know squat Frank.

I know this town
and I'â€™m gonna find him.

All right.



Where'â€™s Dan?

Where'â€™s my husband?

Honey, you should try
to get some sleep.

But where is he?

I need to see him.

He'â€™ll be back.

Now. [shushing]

Try to sleep.

[door slams]



-[scrambling]
-[Frank] Dan!

[bottles clanging]

[breathing heavily]

You know every
weasel in this town.

Now you tell me
what you heard.

I haven'â€™t heard anything.
What are you talking about?

Dan!

You should be locked up,
you know that?

His wife was raped
last night.

I want to know
who did this!

Come on, Dan.
Let'â€™s go home.
Come on.

Come on, get in the car.





Who are these people?

They'â€™re installing the alarm.

[indistinct chattering]

[hammer banging]

Hey, Bill.

Hey, Mr. Rayner.

Mrs. Rayner, my boys
will be out of your way
in a few minutes.

-Show you how it works?
-Sure.

It'â€™s all pretty simple.

You'â€™ve got your
security code,

areas of coverage...

This indicates the zones,
doors, window.

Now, if there'â€™s someone
in the house--

[clears throat]
Can we...

Can we please
do this later?

Sure, sure.

Why don'â€™t you sit
and get ready for bed.

Jess, you should sleep
much better now.

Excuse me.

[metal clanging]

Well, you stay safe.

Thank, bro.


[crickets chirping]

Dan?

[footsteps approaching]

Dan?

Every thing is set, honey.

The alarm is on.

Go on to sleep,
you'â€™re safe.

Aren'â€™t you coming?

I don'â€™t want you
to worry, all right?

I just thought
I'â€™d keep an eye on things.

You go on to sleep.

Go ahead.

[somber music playing]

[bed spring creaking]

There'â€™s no such thing
as too much food.

We need to get your
strength back
with ice-creams and cookies.

Oh, shut up and pamper
yourself for a change.

I'â€™m gonna pamper myself
right up 300 pounds.

Dan would love that.

He'â€™s so relieved you're okay.
He doesn'â€™t care how many
cookies you eat.


No, Carol, it'â€™s been so...

awkward.

He hasn'â€™t...

he hasn'â€™t been
affectionate. He...

can hardly look at me.

Well, it'â€™s gonna
take some time.

It can'â€™t be easy.

Yeah, it'â€™s like some
damaged goods.

Don'â€™t say that.
He doesn'â€™t think that way.

Don'â€™t even joke about that.

Can you drop me
at the police station?

What police?

They have to do
the sketch this afternoon.

Guess they want you
to do it while you
still remember.

I can wait ten years.
I will never forget.

He just kept smiling
the whole time.

Sometimes I think
he liked it so much
he wants to come back.

That'â€™s not gonna happen.

He knows the police
are looking for him everywhere.

He'â€™s a million miles
away by now.

I guarantee it.

I'â€™ll take the cart back.

[suspenseful music playing]

Jess?


Oh, my god.

[indistinct chattering]

Cheek bones were...

sharper, higher.

You'â€™re good.

Most people come in here
and they say, "he was tall."

Okay.

How does it look?

It'â€™s him.

Still in with the artist, huh?

Detective, I called you
this morning.

Well, I knew you'â€™d be
coming in today

and I thought it would
be a better use of time.

When I call you,
you drop your donut
and pick up your phone.

Wanna know what I did
this morning, Dan?

Yeah, I want to know
what did you do this morning.

Got in at 6:00 am,
and I spent five hours
looking at tread templates

trying to find a match
for that sneaker footprint
in your walk way.

This isn'â€™t going fast enough
for me either,

but things take time.

And there'â€™s nothing...

nothing I can do about that.

Detective.

You know about this.

Thank you.
[clearing throat]

Sara MacMillan.

My sister is a friend
of the family

and she saw the police cars
there this morning.

I'â€™m sure it's the same man
who attacked me.

The same man
who attacked Katie Dobson.

They'â€™re kids, Jessica.

But it'â€™s all
in our neighborhood.

We'â€™re working
that angle

but believe me, I'â€™ve been
on the force a long time

and I'â€™ve seen
a few cases like this.

Now this kind of criminal,

they have a very
specific victim profile.

And you and this kid

and Katie Dobson
they couldn'â€™t be
more different than--

It'â€™s him.

I know it.

Well, we won'â€™t ignore
any possibility.

But right now
I'â€™d like to get the sketch
to the deputy chief

and get it out
to the Illinois state police.

We'â€™ll check it out, Dan,
but it isn'â€™t the same man.

I don'â€™t know
who this guy is.

But can'â€™t you see
what'â€™s happening?

I mean she'â€™s getting worse.

You got to catch
this guy fast.

Please.

We'â€™re trying.

But what your wife'â€™s
going through
is completely normal.

None of it is normal.

None of it.

Just wait here,
Mr. and Mrs. MacMillan.

-I'â€™ll get a car
to take you home.
-Thank you.

[indistinct chattering]

I am sorry.

You'â€™re the MacMillans,
aren'â€™t you?

Do we know you?

No. [hesitatingly]
I'â€™m Jessica Rayner

and I live over at
North Maple and...

Well I read

what happened
to your daughter.

How is she?

We don'â€™t know.

She'â€™s in the hospital.

[exhales nervously]

Well, I'â€™m here because...

because a man attacked me...

in my house.

And I thought, maybe, that...

Can you tell me...

anything?
Can you tell me

how it happened?

We were asleep.

We heard her crying and...

We went in
and he'â€™d gone already.

Did she tell you
what he looked like?


put a pillow case over her head.
She didn'â€™t see anything.

Did he say
anything to her?

He said he thought
she was beautiful.

-[intercom buzzing]
-Yeah.

There'â€™s a Mrs. Rayner out here.
She very insistent.

All right.

[door clicks open]

Detective, I need
to talk to you.

Mrs. Rayner,
Deputy Chief Lasser.

Why don'â€™t you sit down?

No, thank you.

Detective Corning,
it is the same man

who attacked me that
attacked Sara MacMillan.

I talked to her parents.


-I asked them about
the attack and they said--
-[Chief Lasser] Mrs. Rayner?

Let me make this clear.

I understand your feelings

of helplessness
and I sympathize.

But I won'â€™t tolerate
interference in other
active cases.

It doesn'â€™t match
the profile.

He doesn'â€™t care
about your profile.

He'â€™s an animal.

I saw his eyes.

He raped me.

And he raped Sara MacMillan

and he'â€™s probably
raped other women.

And he'â€™s gonna
keep on doing it

until someone stops him.

[door shuts]

[Greg sighs]

Maybe she'â€™s not
too far off, chief.

Three attacks
on the north side in a month,

I mean something'â€™s going on.

What was she doing

talking to those people?

Don'â€™t lose control
of this case.

I won'â€™t have freelance cops.

Understand?

Yes, sir.

God, Jessica, you scared
the hell out of me.

-Where did you go?
-Dan, they don'â€™t believe me.

They don'â€™t think
it'â€™s the same man.

-They won'â€™t listen--
-Tell me when
you'â€™re gonna disappear

like that again.
Okay? Please.

Dan?

You believe me, don'â€™t you?

Jessica, I need to know
where you are.

How can I keep you safe
if I don'â€™t know where you are?

Now let'â€™s go home, all right?

[Dan exhales]

Can we talk about
this at home, please?

Come on.

[thunder rumbling]

Look, I just have to go
into the office
for a couple of hours.

I'â€™ll just get some
deals finished.

We'â€™re not gonna be able
to pay the loan this month.

But it'â€™ll be all right.
Don'â€™t worry.

If you feel weird
or anything call me.

I'â€™ll have this
with me all day.

I can be home
in four minutes.

Memory one,
that'â€™s the cellular number.

Okay?

[engine spluttering]

[cloud rumbling]

[alarm blaring]

[ominous music playing]

[phone ringing]

Hello, Jessie?

Dan, oh my god,
it'â€™s him.

Jessie!

Jessie, hang on.

[horn honking]

Where are you?

Jessie, I'â€™ll be there
in a minute. All right?

Just hang on.

[tires screeching]

[engine sputtering]

God damn it! Jessie!

I can'â€™t hear you. Dan?

-Jessie!
-[tires screeching]

[motor revving]

Dan I can'â€™t hear--

[alarm continues blaring]

Shit!

[suspenseful music playing]

[enthralling music playing]

[police siren wailing]

Go from the other
side all right?

Hey, he was here.


He was here. The screen
is on the chair, there'â€™s foot
print in the bushes.

in through the window.

He...

[alarm stops]

He...

But it was right...

Jesus!

Look I understand
she'â€™s upset and a lot
of things could happen.

-Thank you very much.
-All right.

Appreciate it. Bye.

Look, Jessie...

it'â€™s a stormy day.

The screen could
have been blown out.

-It'â€™s your first day--
-Look, I know what I saw.

I am not crazy.

It was him. I know it was.
He came back.


Okay.

[ominous music playing]


I called Carol.
She'â€™ll be here
in a little while.

[Dan sighs]

I love you.

Me too.

[ominous music playing]

[suspenseful music playing]

Hi, honey.

What is this?

There was a girl raped
and killed last year.

Eileen Murphy,
seven blocks away.

He'â€™s been doing it
since then.

Jessie?

Eileen Murphy, Katie Dobson,

Sara MacMillan and me.
Four of us and two are dead.

I'â€™m just one
of the lucky ones.

Now I'â€™m a witness.

He needs to come back
to finish the job.

You know I think you should
put these all away.


Jessica?

[crickets chirping]

[door thuds]

[board creaking]


Dan.

Dan.

What? What?

-I heard something down stairs.
-Okay.

I'â€™ll just take this.

I'â€™ll go take a look.

[suspenseful music playing]

[footsteps running]

-[Jessica] It'â€™s him.
-[door open and shuts]

[alarm blaring]

[dogs barking]

He'â€™s coming back.

He'â€™s coming back for me.

The guy came
right into the house.

He didn'â€™t even set off
the alarm until after he left.

Well, we cranked
the sensitivity all the way up.

That plus the new
sensors will help.

I have to tell you Mr. Rayner,
our system is perfect.

I don'â€™t care
what it costs, Bill.

Make it perfect. Okay?

Okay.

How you doing, Lou?

Hey, Mr. Rayner.

I did this
on all the doors.

Set the hole double deep,
goes right into the frame.

Go on and bolt this.

See, inside the lock.

Watch this.


Okay?

Now, you want to keep
this key some place handy

because without it

you'â€™ll have to bust that wall
down to get out of here.

-Yeah. Thanks, Lou.
-Okay.

[drill machine whizzing]


You know when
these guys are done,

it'â€™s gonna be
just like Fort Knox.

It doesn'â€™t matter.
He'â€™ll find a way in.

-Jessi--
-He will.

Jessie, he knows
we have an alarm.

He knows
I'â€™m waiting up for him.

I mean the police
are practically

camped out
in the neighborhood.

He'â€™d be an idiot
to try to come back here.

Can you try not
to worry, please?

Please.

[door slams shut]

the break-in
very seriously, Dan.

Half the forces is working
on your case in one way
or the other.

Then why is this guy
still out?

Because he'â€™s lucky.

He won'â€™t be lucky forever.

It'â€™s already been forever.

Greg, please,
my wife'â€™s going crazy.

She can'â€™t sleep.

I mean I can'â€™t sleep.

When are you gonna
catch this guy?

I--

[Dan exhales]

Busy?

This Dobson case...

You know, this is every
sex offender

in the state of Illinois that
owns a beige or brown sedan.

Seems someone may have seen
one parked by the river.

The deputy chief cleared
over time as much as you need.

officers to do that for you.

I know. I just--

I don'â€™t wanna
miss anything.

We did get a break today.

The lab test came back.

Seems as though
some of the blood we found

does not belong
to Katie Dobson.

Our boy has left us
a calling card.

Hurray!

We should get preliminary
DNA back in two weeks or so

and as soon as we catch him,
he'â€™s as good as convicted.

Ahem, [clearing throat]
I won'â€™t make it home
for dinner tonight.

Oh, you want to sneak out
for burger later?

Hey, young lady,
don'â€™t you know

that fraternization
with a senior officer

is strictly against
the department policy?

Yeah, I remember reading
about that somewhere.

[Greg thoughtfully]

Could you do me a favor?

Anything.

When the DNA test
come back,

I'â€™d like to check them
against the semen sample
of Jessica Rayner

and Sara MacMillan.

You think they'â€™re connected?

Maybe.

Jessie, we'â€™ve been
through this already.

I told you the guy lives
in the neighborhood. Right?

-Dan, please listen--
-He must

because he seems
to know his way around.

I figured if we cruise
around long enough,

we'â€™ll be able to spot him.

-Dan.
-Look.

I called Carol
and she'â€™s on her way over.

Please don'â€™t go.

[knock at the door]

[door clicks open]

Hi.

I don'â€™t want
you doing this.

You'â€™re preaching
to the converted.

Look you pay taxes.

Why don'â€™t you let the cops
drive around all night?

Dan, please.

Jess, just make sure
the alarm is set.

[door shuts]

Look how empty it is.

There'â€™s nobody
out here.

Somebody must be
pretty scared, huh?

How is Jessica?

She'â€™ll be fine
once I catch this guy.

Now keep your eyes open.

[siren wails]

[police officer] Oh, it'â€™s you,
Mr. Rayner, take care.

He'â€™s sure out of the force.

I got stopped on my way
over to your house.

Yeah, well whatever
they'â€™re doing, it isn't enough.

I can'â€™t believe Dan
just took off like that.

With all that'â€™s happened,
I can'â€™t believe he'd
leave you alone at night.

I'â€™m not alone.

For gods sakes, Jessi
he shouldn'â€™t be out there

roaming the streets
like some vigilante.

You were almost killed,
he should be home.

In case anything else
happens, he should be here
to protect you.

I don'â€™t want him
to do that. Okay?

I don'â€™t want him
to protect me.
I just want him to--

I just want him
to hold me.

Oh, Jess.

He hasn'â€™t touched me.
Not once, not since...

[sighs softly]

I know he'â€™s trying
to be so strong and...

and I don'â€™t care. I just...

I don'â€™t know if he
wants me anymore.

I want him so much.
I need him.

Dan, it'â€™s getting late.

I think we should go home.

[suspenseful music playing]

It'â€™s him, it's him!

[tires screeching]

[motor revving]

Dan!

[tires screeching]

Dan, just wait.

-Stop.
-Hey, easy, easy.

Stop right there!

All right.

What are you
doing here, huh?

-Easy, easy.
-Frank?

Easy. Hold it, Dan.

Frank, what the hell
is going on here.

For gods sakes,
it'â€™s Rick Stanzo.

He lives in the neighborhood.

He'â€™s been living here
for ten years.


Rick, I'â€™m really sorry.

I'â€™m sorry, Rick

Listen, what are you
trying to do?

Waving a gun around,
you'â€™re gonna kill somebody.

He'â€™s out there, Frank.

Ease up, Dan.

He started this, not me.

You'â€™re acting crazy.

[eerie music playing]

"Crazy."

I don'â€™t think
he'â€™s coming back.

But we are set up
for him this time.

[door shuts]

You can go to sleep.
Just go to sleep.

I'â€™m staying up for him.

Today I'â€™m staying up
for that bastard.

What? What is it?

Let'â€™s go to bed.

No.

We both can'â€™t sleep.

You sleep.

I'â€™ll stay awake,
I'â€™ll keep watch--

Dan, hon,
come to bed please.

I want us to make love.
I need you.

No. I shouldn'â€™t.

No, I'â€™ve to check
the windows.

Now you go,
you go to sleep.

I'â€™ll keep watch.
I'â€™ll be here, I will.

I promise I'â€™ll be here.


[Jessica crying]

Hi, Jessica.

-How'â€™re you feeling?
-I'â€™m all right, detective.

I wanted to know
if there was anyway that...

I could see the police report
on my case.

Those reports
are not for the public.

Why would you
want to see them anyway?

I just need to make
some sense of all this.

All right.

But you'â€™ll have to look
at them here.

[door knocking]

Mrs. MacMillan,
I'â€™m Jessica Rayner.

We met at the police station.

I remember you.

I was wondering if we could
talk about the attack.

This is where he went in.

This is Sara'â€™s room.

She doesn'â€™t...

She sleeps in our room now.

[suspenseful music playing]

[phone ringing]

[phone continues ringing]

Dan?

Dan Rayner'â€™s office.

No, Steve,
he'â€™s on another line.

Yeah. I'â€™ll give him
the message.

Bye.

I'â€™ll leave you alone.

Everything was so good.

The business was finally
coming together.

We had some
extra money to spend...

For the first time.

Everything was so good...

then this.

In one night.

I go away and...

everything good
just disappears.

Oh, God!

In one night.

Dan, things will get better.

It just takes time.

I'â€™ve got the alarm

and I stay up all night

just to make sure
nothing happens.

And now she'â€™s reading

her police files and...

copying articles
out of news papers.

[keys jingle]

[sighing in despair]

She doesn'â€™t think
I can protect her.

She'â€™s been through hell.

All the alarm systems
in world aren'â€™t going
to make her forget that.

She'â€™s got to put
this behind her.

How?

You got to start
doing things again.
Normal things.

Believe me.

It'â€™s the only way
you'â€™re gonna feel right again.

[footsteps walk away]

-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

Are you okay?
You know I called all day.

I just needed
to get out of the house.


What'â€™s that?

You'â€™re having a cleaning fit?

No. [CHUCKLES]

Will put a grill
tomorrow night.

I invited Carol

and Frank and some
of the people from the office.

Party?

No, it'â€™s not a party,
it'â€™s a barbecue.

You know, then I get to wear
my funny chef'â€™s hat.

I don'â€™t know, Dan.

Oh, Jessica, please.

We need it.

We both do.

I mean,
we need to make--

We need to make things
normal again. Okay?

Okay.

Great.

All I need now
is a fine chef'â€™s hat.

[crickets chirping]

[car whirring]

[woman over radio]


[somber music playing]

[suspenseful music playing]

[haunting music playing]

[bottles clanging]

[door shuts]

[intense music playing]


blonde, blue eyes,
35, married.

Hubby was up stairs,
didn'â€™t hear a thing.

I know. It doesn'â€™t make
any sense.

Two women murdered,
two more raped.

Half the police in the city
are tracking down leads

and we can'â€™t connect them.
When the hell is that DNA
test coming?

I don'â€™t know. Next week.

I know you'â€™re
the veteran at this

but none of this matches
with any predator rapist
I'â€™ve ever read about.

I mean kidnappers
don'â€™t do break-in.

And Dobson and MacMillan,
two kids.

And Glen and Rayner
are two grown women.

They don'â€™t even look
like each other.

Well, they'â€™re all pretty tall
and blonde.

Yeah except for

-Sara MacMillan.
-Sara MacMillan, yeah.

Throw her into the mix
and it messes everything up.

I know.

How is a dark kid
have to do with any of this?

She looks like her father.

Mom was tall and blonde--

He wasn'â€™t after Sara.
He was after the mother.

We'â€™re gonna have to pull
every unsolved murder
or rape in the past five years.

See if there'â€™s
any other cases.

Yeah, I'â€™m gonna go back
over all the tests and see
what matches up.

When that DNA
comes in, we can be sure.

I don'â€™t need any DNA.
I'â€™m sure already. Come on.

[soft guitar music playing]

One burnt to crisp
for me, Dan.

Absolutely.

Here you go.

You know, Frank,
you'â€™re absolutely right.

This is a great idea.

Thanks.

Great food.
It'â€™s thanks enough.

She knows about
that woman last night, huh?

Hmm, she wouldn'â€™t
talk about it.

She'â€™s not getting
any better, Frank.

[guitar music continue]

I'â€™m heading out
to the store.

We need some more
trash bags.

Could you stay?
I don'â€™t want to leave her alone.

Yeah, sure thing.

Do you think we should
pull out those bushes?

Because he could hide in there
like he did before and just

jump out.

Yeah, I could do it tomorrow.

Dan and I will trim it back.

Maybe.

Maybe that would be better.
Maybe that would be a good idea.

Hmm.

You need a hand?
Come on.

Move over.
I'â€™m an expert.

He killed another woman
last night, you know.

Yeah, I know.

[water gushing]

He'â€™s coming
back for me. He...

He needs to kill me
because I'â€™ve seen him.

Jessica,

you'â€™re totally
right to be scared,

but have you considered
seeing someone?

You know a psychiatrist.
Someone to help you deal
with this obsession--

It'â€™s not an obsession.

Yeah, maybe that'â€™s
not the right word but--


[alarm blaring]

[intense music playing]

Maybe you don'â€™t need
a psychiatrist.

I'â€™ll hold.

He was in the house.
I mean, he was five
feet away.

He only ran because he heard
a man'â€™s voice.

What if she'â€™d been alone?
God knows what would
have happened.

She'â€™s been saying all along
he was coming back.

saying it all along.

Do you believe her now?

Yes, Frank, I believe that.

You do?

Well, of course, you do.

What are you gonna
do about it?

Yeah, well, look tell him
to hurry up, huh?

Look, Frank we have every
available car focused
on the north side.

We'â€™ve pulled everyone,
traffic, vice, office cops.

Everyone'â€™s on triple shifts
working this case
looking for this guy.

-[sergeant] Detective.
-Yeah.

All right.

He was in the house.

In the middle of the day.

This guy'â€™s got some guts.

Jessie, you'â€™re okay?

-I have to go.
-What are you doing?

I have to go,
I have to leave.

Jess, where are you going?

I can'â€™t stay here.

To move away, another city,

some place where
he can'â€™t find me.
Far away.

Jess, you'â€™re not
going anywhere.

We grew up on this street.
We know who lives
in every single house

and who lived here before that
and this is our street.

No, it'â€™s his.
It'â€™s his now.

Jess, stop it please?

Look,

I'â€™m your sister,

and I love you
but you can not
run away from this.

You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

[Carol inhales]

Honey, he cannot
make you leave your home.

This is your home

and you are going
to have to fight for it.

I don'â€™t know if I can.

So what have we got?

The guys from vice volunteered
to do foot patrols.

Now I figured that
and with the extra sector cars

we should have someone
passing by here
every ten minutes.

Good.

-See you at the station.
-Yeah.

They know the score.

Now things
are gonna happen.

Police can'â€™t protect her.

I can'â€™t protect her.

I know Corning.

He'â€™s gonna nail this guy.

Go home, Frank.

Please.

Just go home.

[breeze blowing]

-Are you all right?
-I'â€™m fine.

When was the last time
you got a night'â€™s sleep?

Come to bed.

No.

I should stay down here,
in case.

I don'â€™t need you down here.
I need you in bed with me.

Look I know...

I know that you
don'â€™t wanna touch me.

And I understand,
I feel dirty too.

Dirty?

[somber music playing]

No.

God, Jessica.

He could never touch
the things we had that I love.

Then what is it, Dan?

I have to stop him.

I can'â€™t let it happen again.

Let what happen?

You didn'â€™t let
anything happen.

I did.

I stayed.

While I was playing
black jack,

he came into our house.

If I'â€™d come home...

none of this
would have happened.


It'â€™s all my fault.

Don'â€™t you see?

I should have been
here to protect you.

Sweet heart, you
cannot protect me.

And the police
can'â€™t protect me.

I have to protect myself.

Look, I can be scared
but I can'â€™t be helpless.

But what if he should
come back?

He will come back.

When he does, we'â€™ll both
be ready for him, both of us.

We won'â€™t be
helpless anymore.

Come to bed.

[Dan exhaling]

Then breathe.

Then bring the gun down.

Always keep the gun
down by your side.

Sure you wanna do this?

You'â€™ve always hated guns.

I do.

Even more now.

All right, bring it up,
release the safety.

Dan, I can'â€™t...

Both eyes open.

One breath...

let it out slowly...


Hey, you'â€™re a natural.


Keep it down.

All right, this time...

start with the gun down,

then bring it up.

In case you have to do
this for real,

you don'â€™t have to spend
all day aiming.

-All right,
on the count of three.
-Okay.

-You ready?
-Ah-ha.

One, two, three.

So much for being
a natural.

All right, well,
you'â€™ll have to do
what the rest of us do.

Practice. Come on.

You'â€™re ready?
Bring it up, fire.

Again.

Okay, let'â€™s start again
at the beginning.

Eileen Murphy
was killed last year

August 1st
which was a Sunday.

Can you be sure
it was the same guy?

No, but it is a good guess.

Now Katie Dobson

was killed June 10th.

He broke into our house

on the 19th
and I was attacked
on the 21st.

Okay, if it was the same guy.
Why did he wait a year?

Yeah and why did he
attack you

and Katie in the same month?

Maybe he had a thing
for summer. I don'â€™t know.

Windows are open
in the summer.

Yeah. Smart guy you married.

Why is he doing that?

Oh, he thinks better
when he'â€™s cleaning.

Now this guy likes to come
after we'â€™ve had guests.


Have friends over,
had a few beers,
you'â€™re relaxed.

Yeah, we set up our alarm
on the 1st and 11th.

When was Debbie Gwen killed?

Gwen, July 31st.

He likes the number,
one doesn'â€™t he?

That'â€™s it.

What? What are you guys
getting at?


Days with one in them.

That'â€™s when
he likes to go out.

Jess, half of the days
in a month have a one in them.

The 1st, the 11th
and the 21st.

Those of the days
he likes best.

That doesn'â€™t make sense. Why?

Because he'â€™s nuts, Frank.
That'â€™s why.

And we don'â€™t need to know why,
we just need to know

when he'â€™s coming back
so we can catch him.


we know.

See, we all kind
of look alike.

Tall with blonde hair
except Sara MacMillan

so I thought

he was after the mother.

You don'â€™t have to
convince me, Jessica,

because the DNA report
came back this afternoon

and it'â€™s a match.
You'â€™re right.

It'â€™s the same man.

Are you absolutely sure
you don'â€™t wanna come
and work with us?

Look, the really important
thing is right here.

Take a look
at this calender.

What are these,
all the attacks?

See, he seems to have
an obsession
with the number one.

I don'â€™t know, Jessica,
it'â€™s a good theory but...

Sara MacMillan
was attacked on the 22nd.

She was attacked at 3 am.

He was out
looking for her on the 21st.

He just didn'â€™t find her
until after mid-night.

See, he'â€™s crazy.
But he'â€™s predictable.

A-ha.

Now Saturday is the 11th,
his favorite day.

-[Greg] And...
-We could be ready for him.

He likes to come after a party.
We'â€™ll throw a party.

He likes to come in
that window--

We'â€™ll open the window.

and we'â€™ll keep
the alarm off.

He'â€™s feel totally welcome
and when he comes in

we'â€™ll be waiting for him.

It'â€™s a long shot.

And I don'â€™t know
if I can get Lasser
to commit to man power.

Detective...

I cannot explain
this logically

but I know in here

that he'â€™s coming on
Saturday night.

Okay.

but she'â€™s thinking clearly.

She wants one cop
on post in her home

if we can spare.

Do we have anyone to spare?

I know it'â€™ll mean
triple shift patrols
every night.

we'â€™ll have to take a lot
of people off the street.

It'â€™s a crazy idea
but I think it'â€™s worth it.

here, chief,

we maybe getting
closer to this guy

but we'â€™re a long way
from catching him.

And hell, I didn'â€™t think
he'â€™s come for Jessica again.

But he did.

She knows

a little something
about the way
this creep thinks.


All right.

[Chief Lasser]
Mrs. Rayner and her--

God I'â€™ve been pretty sure
so far maybe we should
start listening to her.

Greg, you got the duty.

Start tonight.

Keep it going for two weeks
and we'â€™ll reassess.

Beth you coordinate
back up.

Yes, sir.

Thanks, sir.

Maybe we'â€™ll get lucky.

And I'â€™m in this job
for 27 years. I thought
I gotten use to it all.

Last three weeks I'â€™ve slept
in the hall outside
my daughters bedroom.

You believe that?

Yeah.

You get lucky, both of you...

to catch this maniac.

Yes, sir.

Brought you a beer.

[saxophone music playing]

[indistinct chattering]

Hey, honey.

How are you holding up?

Tonight'â€™s tonight.

[Dan clears throat]

Come on, smile.

It'â€™s supposed to be a party.

Maybe this was
a terrible idea.

-You want to back out?
-[Jessica exhales]

No.

I want it to be over.

[music continues playing]

-Please be careful.
-Okay.

Thanks.

Carol.

-Hi.
-Hi.

Should have come
for the party.
Dan'â€™s a grill king.

Truly amazing.

Oh, I have to spend some time
with my beautiful wife.

She'â€™s starting think
I live here.

[door shuts]

Well, dishes are done.

Can'â€™t have him breaking
into a dirty house, can we?

What about this one?

His favorite window?

Leave it open.

Well, now that the cavalry'â€™s
here, I guess I'â€™ll head home.

Thanks, Frank.

-Goodnight, Frank.
-Goodnight, Dan.

Look, if he does come by,

don'â€™t bother saying halt,
just shoot him.

Bang bang you'â€™re dead.

All right.
Have a goodnight.


[door lock clicks]

I got to change.

[ominous music playing]

[dog barking]

Okay, there is food
in the fridge

and cookies in the cabinet.

I don'â€™t know what else to say
except thank you.

Greg uh...

You be careful. Okay?

-Goodnight.
-Yeah, goodnight.

[suspenseful music playing]

I'â€™m shaking.

So glad you'â€™re with me.

Me too.

[crickets chirping]

[wind blowing]

[intense music playing]

[eerie music playing]


[enthralling music playing]

[intense music playing]

[intense music continues]


Police! Get your hands up!


Turn around real slow.

-What?
-[gun firing]

[glass shatters]

[burglar groans]

-Are you all right?
-[gunshot]

Okay, okay.

[breathing heavily]


All right, stay here.

this is 63.

-Are you okay?
-Stay there.

Suspect is in the house.

He'â€™s armed. I say again
the suspect is armed.

Approach with caution.

What happened?

I had him and he bolted.

I got him cornered
in the kitchen.

Are you sure you'â€™re okay?

I'â€™m okay, he took a few
shots at me but I'â€™m okay.

Now look, you stay up there

and don'â€™t worry
about it. I'â€™ll get him.

You keep that door closed.

[glass crashing]

-Greg?
-Stay there.

-Dan?
-Greg!

Dan, please let'â€™s
get back to the room.

Jessie...

Jessie, I can'â€™t wait here.

I have to try to go help.

-Okay.
-[exhales]

You go back.

And you shoot anybody
who comes through that door.

Don'â€™t worry,
I'â€™ll knock first.

I love you very much.

I love you.

[intense music playing]

-Greg?
-[whispers]
You go back up stairs.

Not a chance, man.

All right.

[suspenseful music playing]

[utensils clanging]

All right, come on.

[metal clanging]


Can I have the flashlight?

[enthralling music playing]


[wind blowing]

through here?

He must be out back.

Make sure you'â€™re locked up
behind us.

[lock clicks]

[enthralling music playing]

[indistinct whispers]

[ominous music playing]

What'â€™s going on?

Jessie, he'â€™s outside.

Please just close
the window, okay?





[door knob squelching]





[door vibrating]


[door vibrating]


[intense music playing]

-You son of a bitch.
-[door clicks]

Jessie?


[gun fires]

He'â€™s in there.

-Get away from the door.
-Jessie, come here.

[glass crushing]

He went out the back.

-[Jessie squealing]
-Jessie, no. Jessie!

-[crying]
-Stop!

watch it.

-Jessie, wait!
-No.

[Jessica breathing heavily]

No.

No.[tearfully]


No.


Jessie, your hand.

The suspect
has left the premises.
He'â€™s gone out the back end,

Oh, Danny.

All right, baby.

It'â€™s all right.

Let me see.

-Oh, Danny.
-[shushing]

Come on.

Come on.

It'â€™s okay, come on.
It'â€™s okay.

Come on.

It'â€™s okay.

It'â€™s okay.

It'â€™s okay.

-How you holding up?
-He got away.

We had our chance,
he got away.

We'â€™ve got a 150 cops
on the North side, Jessica.

We'â€™ll get him.

This way please.

Greg.

-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'â€™m okay.

How is the search going?

Nothing yet.

What happened?


He was right there.
A second faster
and this all been over.

Jessica was right
all along.

[nurse humming]

There.

Move it around a little.

Well those are some
nasty cuts.

That'â€™s for the pain.

Thank you.

[woman over PA system]
