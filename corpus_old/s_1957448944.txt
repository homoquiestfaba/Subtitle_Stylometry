(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)

FEMALE NARRATOR:
<i>It began as a holiday.</i>

<i>Arthur Howitzer, Jr.,
college freshman,</i>

<i>eager to escape a bright
future on the Great Plains,</i>

<i>convinced his father, proprietor
of the</i> Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun,

<i>to fund his transatlantic passage
as an educational opportunity</i>

<i>to learn the family business</i>

<i>through the production of
a series of travelogue columns</i>

<i>to be published for local readers
in the Sunday</i> Picnic <i>magazine.</i>

(KIDS CHATTERING AND LAUGHING)

(SHOOING IN FRENCH)

(KIDS YELLING)

FEMALE NARRATOR: <i>Over the next
ten years, he assembled a team</i>

<i>of the best expatriate
journalists of his time</i>

<i>and transformed</i> Picnic
<i>into</i> The French Dispatch,

<i>a factual weekly report on the
subjects of world politics,</i>

<i>the arts,
high and low, fashion,</i>

<i>fancy cuisine, fine drink,</i>

<i>and diverse stories
of human interests</i>

<i>set in faraway quartiers.</i>

<i>He brought the world

(BELL TINKLES)

<i>His writers line the spines of

<i>Berensen,</i>

<i>Sazerac,</i>

<i>Krementz,</i>

<i>Roebuck Wright.</i>

<i>One reporter known

<i>in quality of sentences

<i>One who never completed

<i>but haunted the halls

<i>One privately blind writer
who wrote keenly</i>

<i>through the eyes of others.</i>

(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

FEMALE NARRATOR:
<i>The uncontested crackerjack</i>

<i>of grammatical expertise.</i>

<i>Cover illustrations
by Hermes Jones.</i>

<i>Famously gracious
with his writers,</i>

<i>Arthur Jr. was less courteous</i>

<i>with the rest of
the magazine's staff.</i>

ARTHUR: Oh, no, what's that?

I need a turkey.

Stuffed and roasted
on a table

with all the trimmings
and pilgrims!

FEMALE NARRATOR:
<i>His fiscal management system</i>

<i>was convoluted but functional.</i>

ARTHUR: Give her 150 francs
a week for the next 15 years

against five American cents
per word, minus expenses.

FEMALE NARRATOR: <i>His most
repeated literary advice,</i>

<i>perhaps apocryphal,
was simply this...</i>

ARTHUR: Just try to
make it sound like

you wrote it that
way on purpose.

FEMALE NARRATOR:
<i>His return to Liberty</i>

<i>comes precisely 50 years
after his departure,</i>

<i>on the occasion
of his funeral,</i>

<i>by which time the magazine's
circulation exceeds</i>

<i>half a million subscribers
in 50 countries.</i>

<i>A willow hamper
containing umpteen pins,</i>

<i>plaques,
and official citations</i>

<i>of the highest order
is buried at his side,</i>

<i>along with
an Andretti Ribbon-mate</i>

<i>and a ream of triple bond,
Egyptian cotton typing stock.</i>

<i>He received
an Editor's burial.</i>

<i>In his will,
he stipulated that</i>

<i>immediately upon his death,
quote...</i>

ARTHUR: (ON SPEAKERS) <i>The
presses will be dismantled</i>

<i>and liquefied.</i>

<i>The editorial offices will be
vacated and sold.</i>

<i>The staff will be paid
ample bonuses</i>

<i>and released
from their contracts,</i>

<i>and the publication
of the magazine</i>

<i>will permanently cease.</i>

FEMALE NARRATOR: <i>Thus,</i>

<i>the publisher's obituary

<i>as that of this publication.</i>

<i>All home delivery readers

<i>be refunded, pro rata</i>

<i>for the unfulfilled portion
of their subscriptions.</i>

<i>His epitaph will be taken verbatim
from the stenciled shingle</i>

<i>fixed above the door

Berensen's article.
<i>The Concrete Masterpiece.</i>

Three dangling participles,
two split infinitives

and nine spelling errors in
the first sentence alone.

ARTHUR: Some of those
are intentional.

under a single vast,

glass-and-cast-iron

later demolished,

Like every living city,

Ennui supports a menagerie
of vermin and scavengers.

A mixed blessing.
On the one hand,

the honking,

The emission of toxic fumes

the dangerous accidents,

No, I don't.

BERENSEN: <i>We take as the
subject of tonight's lecture,</i>

the great painter
at the vanguard

and heart of the French
Splatter-school Action-group,

Mr. Moses Rosenthaler.

Widely celebrated,
as you know,

for the bold
dramatic style,

and colossal scale
of his middle-period,

in particular,
of course,

the polyptych-tableaux
known as...

<i>Ten Reinforced Cement
Aggregate Load-Bearing Murals.</i>

He remains, in my opinion,
the most eloquent

and certainly,
the loudest artistic voice

of his rowdy generation.

How does this pivotal
piece come to find its way

into its unique position as
a permanent installation here

at the Clampette Collection?

The story begins
in a mess hall.

(BELL RINGS)

<i>The exhibition,</i> Ashtrays,
Pots, and Macrame,

<i>a group show of handicrafts
by amateur artisans</i>

<i>incarcerated in
the lunatic section</i>

<i>of the Ennui Prison-Asylum,</i>

<i>might, perhaps,
have been omitted</i>

<i>from the annals
of art history,</i>

<i>had it not been
for the inclusion</i>

<i>in its number
of a small painting</i>

<i>by Mr. Rosenthaler,
who was, at that time,</i>

<i>serving a 50-year sentence</i>

<i>for the crime of
double homicide,</i>

<i>and the observation of that
work by a fellow inmate,</i>

<i>the Levantine art dealer
Mr. Julian Cadazio,</i>

<i>who, by fateful coincidence,
happened to be imprisoned</i>

<i>in the adjoining annex
on a charge</i>

<i>of second-degree
sales tax evasion.</i>

Guard.

Who painted this picture?

GUARD: Citizen 7524.

I believe that unit
designates maximum security

for the demented
and deranged.

Are you able to
provide me an escort

and a Friendly Visit Stamp

for immediate use?

(GUARD CHEWING LOUDLY)

<i>Simone, Naked.
Cell Block J. Hobby Room.</i>

I wanna buy it.

Why?

Because I like it.

It's not for sale.

Yes, it is.

No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

No, it isn't.
It is, yes. It is.

All artists sell
all their work.

It's what makes you
an artist.

Selling it. If you don't wish
to sell it, don't paint it.

Question is,
what's your price?

50 cigarettes.

Actually, make it 75.

Why do you keep
looking at that guard?

She's Simone.

Ah.

I don't want to buy this
important piece for 50 cigarettes.

ROSENTHALER: 75.
Or 75 of prison currency.

I want to pay you
250,000 francs

in legal French tender.

Do we agree on the sale?

Uh-huh.

I can only offer
a deposit of, uh...

83 <i>centimes,</i>
one candied chestnut,

and four cigarettes.

Everything I have at this
present moment in time.

However, if you'll accept my
signatory voucher, I assure you

a check for
the outstanding balance

will be remitted to your
account within 90 days.

Where do you bank?

Never mind.


How'd you learn to
do it, by the way?

Paint this kind of picture.

Also, who'd you murder,
and how crazy are you, really?

I need background
information

so that we can do
a book about you.

It makes you
more important.

Who are you...

Moses Rosenthaler?

Born rich,

the son of a Jewish-Mexican
horse rancher,

Miguel Sebastian Maria
Moises de Rosenthaler

trained at
the <i>Ecole des Antiquites</i>

at significant
family expense.

But, by the end
of his youth,

he had shed
all the luxuries

of his comfortable background
and replaced them with...

<i>Squalor.</i>

(OLD-TIMEY SONG PLAYING)

<i>Hunger.</i>

<i>Loneliness.</i>

<i>Physical danger.</i>

<i>Mental illness.</i>

<i>And, of course...</i>

This thing?

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Citizen 7524,
address the class.

What do you mean?

Tell the group
about yourself.

I don't wanna do that.
It's mandatory.

They know me already.
That's not the point.

I haven't even prepared a speech.
Say something.

Well, I've been here
3,647 days and nights.

Another 14,603 to go.

I drink 14 pints of
mouthwash rations per week.

At that rate,

I think I'm going to
poison myself to death

before I ever get to see
the world again,

which makes me feel

very sad.

I gotta change my program.

I gotta go in a new direction.

Anything I can do to keep
my hands busy, I'm gonna do.

Otherwise,

I think maybe it's
gonna be a suicide.

And that's why
I signed up

for clay pottery
and basket weaving.

My name is Moses.

Take a pew.

(BONES CRUNCH)
(MAN GROANS)

What's your name,
<i>gardienne?</i>


BERENSEN: <i>Certain women do
gravitate toward incarcerated men.</i>

<i>It's a recognized condition.</i>

Something about
the captivity of others

enhances the experience
of their own freedom.

I assure you,
it's erotic.

Look at her,
by the way.

Born into
quasi-serfdom,

16 brothers
and sisters.

Illiterate until
she was 20.

Now, a woman of
considerable property.

Radiant.
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

Good God.

Wrong slide.
That's me.

Simone, of course,
refused all

Rosenthaler's
entreaties of marriage,

which, we are told,
were frequent

and marvelously
enthusiastic.

ROSENTHALER: I wanna say it
as simple as I can.

To try to shape it into words.

The feelings in my heart.

I don't love you.
I love you.

What?
I don't love you.

Already?

Already what?

Already how do
you know that?

How can you be sure?
It's so quick.

I'm sure.

Ouch.

That hurts me.

The cruelty of it.
The cold-bloodedness.

You said what
you wanted to say.

I tried to stop you.
That's it.

I said part of what
I wanted to say.

I was in the middle
of it. There's more.

No.

No what? Will you...
No.

Will you marry me?
No.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

(SWITCH CLICKS)

I'm gonna need art supplies.

Canvas, stretchers,
brushes, turpentine.

What do you want to paint?

The future.

Which is you.

Widely not considered
a great connoisseur,

Julian Cadazio, nevertheless,
had an eye for something,

and he did us all
a very good turn

when the hour he was
released from prison...

(CLOCK TICKING)

We're done with flowers
and fruit bowls.

We're finished with
beaches and seascapes.

We're getting out of armor,
rugs, and tapestries, too.

I found something new.

Modern art?

Modern art.
Our specialty, starting now.

I don't get it.
Of course you don't.

Am I too old?
Of course you are.

Why is this good?
It isn't good. Wrong idea.

That's no answer.

My point. You see
the girl in it?

BOTH: No.

Trust me,
she's there.

One way to tell if a modern artist
actually knows what he's doing

is to get him to
paint you a horse

or a flower or
a sinking battleship,

or something that's actually
supposed to look like

the thing that it's actually
supposed to look like.

Can he do it?
Look at this.

Drawn in 45 seconds right in front
of me with a burnt matchstick.

A perfect sparrow.
That's excellent.

May I keep it?

Don't be stupid.
Of course not.

The point is, he could paint
this beautifully if he wanted,

but he thinks
this is better.

And I think I sort of
agree with him.

<i>Simone, Naked. Cell Block J.
Hobby Room</i> is probably a masterpiece

worth a significant,
even exorbitant, sum of money.

But not yet.

Hmm. The desire
must be created.

Mmm.

How long is he in for?

(CHAIN CLINKING)

CHIEF MAGISTRATE:
Mr. Rosenthaler,

why should we put you
back on the street?

Because it was an
accident, Your Honor.

I didn't intend
to kill anybody.

You decapitated two
bartenders with a meat saw.

(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

ROSENTHALER: The first
bartender was an accident.

The second one
was self-defense.

Well, be that as it may,

what demonstration
of genuine remorse,

or, at the very least,

regret can you offer
for beheading these men?

They had it coming.

I beg your pardon?
Forgive me. Uh...

Is there a part of this
ritual where you ask

if anybody has something
to say before it's too late?

Like, at a wedding.

No.
I'll be brief.

We all know this man
is a murderer.

Totally guilty of
first-degree homicide,

any way you slice it.

That's a given.

However, he's also that rare
once-in-a-generation guy

that you hear about,

but never get the chance
to discover for yourself.

An artistic genius.

Surely, there ought
to be a double standard

for this sort of
predicament.

Supposedly, he's a
psychotic, by the way.

That's not his fault.

Respectfully, I submit...

maybe we could think up some
other way to punish him?

BERENSEN: <i>Rosenthaler's right
to petition for parole</i>

<i>was permanently revoked</i>

<i>for the duration
of his sentence.</i>

(POPS LIPS)
No further questions.

Nevertheless,
Cadazio and his uncles

were unanimous
in their decision

to promote the artist
as his exclusive brokers

throughout the free world.

Simone <i>travelled far and wide.</i>

<i>The Ennui Salon.</i>

<i>The Royal Exposition.</i>

<i>The International Pavilion at the
Liberty, Kansas State Fair,</i>

<i>which was very nearly
burned to the ground.</i>

<i>In short, the picture
was a sensation.</i>

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
(AUCTIONEER GAVEL BANGING)

<i>Even the artist's all but
forgotten earlier work</i>

<i>inspired wildly robust sales
on the secondary market.</i>

Meanwhile, Rosenthaler continued
to work in confinement.

Strikingly, the artist
favored raw materials sourced

exclusively from within
the prison-asylum domain.

<i>Powdered eggs.</i>

<i>Pigeon blood.</i>

<i>Shackle grease.</i>

<i>Coal, cork, and dung.</i>

<i>Fire, of course.</i>

<i>Bright yellow scullery soap.</i>

<i>And fresh cream of millet
as a binding agent.</i>

<i>Simone liked to stand still.</i>

<i>Indeed, she was Olympian
in her ability to hold</i>

<i>extremely challenging
positions</i>

<i>for extended
periods of time.</i>

<i>She exhibited
very little vulnerability</i>

<i>to extremes of heat or cold.</i>

<i>After even the most adverse
forms of exposure,</i>

<i>her skin remained unburned,
unblemished, un-goose-pimpled.</i>

<i>Another tidbit.</i>

<i>She genuinely enjoyed
the smell of turpentine</i>

<i>and in later years
actually wore it</i>

<i>in the application
of her toilet.</i>

<i>She was more than a muse.</i>

(KEYS JINGLE)

ROSENTHALER: Throw the switch.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Throw the switch,
you cocksucker.

What's wrong with you?
Go back to work.

I can't.

I won't. It's too hard.

It's torture.

I'm literally
a tortured artist.

(SNAPS FINGERS)

(SWITCH CLICKS)


The French Splatter-school
Action-group.

A dynamic, talented,
lusty, slovenly, alcoholic,

violent pack of
creative savages.

They inspired
and very often

personally attacked each other
for two decades and more.

I'll have my drink now.

(BOTTLE CLINKS)

Remember, in those days,
as you know,

it was much more
socially acceptable

for a painter or a sculptor

to hit another fellow with
a chair or even a brick

or walk around
with a black eye

or a broken tooth
and so on.

Indeed, I'm jumping ahead,
but in my own experience,

Rosenthaler could be quite
unpredictably impulsive.

Uh, meaning, I refer to
the, uh, pigment locker

beneath his studio in
the <i>Boulevard des Plombiers,</i>

on one occasion,
he grabbed me and put me in there,

and inappropriately,
sort of, tried to fuck me

against the wall in the
corner of that pigment locker.

He was crazy.
Officially certified.

The Cadazios, of course,
represented them all.

It's three years later.

We've made you the most
famous painter alive

based on one small,
scribbly, overrated picture.

You're an art school course.

You're an encyclopedia entry.

Even your disciples have won and
squandered multiple fortunes,

yet you refuse to show us
so much as a sketch or a study

for a single new piece during this
entire, protracted period.

How long are
we meant to wait?

Well, don't answer,
because we're not asking.

We already printed
the invitations.

We're coming in.

All of us. The collectors.
The critics.

Even your second-rate imitators
we represent who suck up to you

and smuggle you goodies and probably
turn out to be better than you are.

The bribes alone are
going to be outrageous,

as these guards
can assure you.

But we're gonna pay 'em.

So, finish it,
whatever it is.

The show is in two weeks.


She thinks it's ready,
by the way.

It's ready.

I could use another year.

(YELLS IN FRUSTRATION)

My employer,
at that time,

received the intriguing
summons

by rapid-priority wire.

I refer, of course,
to Upshur "Maw" Clampette.

Astute collector

Great friend
to the avant-garde.

Her collection,
even in its infancy,

was well-known
and important,

as was her residence,

Ingo Steen's first
American commission

informally known as
the Doorstop House.

It was my duty,
and I may say,

my privilege
to catalogue,

archive, and advise,

although she did whatever
the hell she wanted,

no matter what you
told her, anyway.

<i>Thus, we began
the long journey</i>

<i>from Liberty to Ennui.</i>

JULIAN: <i>My dear Mrs.
Clampette, Maw, if I may,</i>

<i>please join us
for the first display</i>

<i>of Mr. Moses Rosenthaler's

<i>which I, myself, have not yet

<i>In order to facilitate the

<i>it may prove necessary for us</i>

<i>to surreptitiously gain
access to the facility</i>

<i>where the artist

<i>Please rely on my operatives</i>

<i>to organize any

<i>and preparations
for your visit.</i>

<i>Caution, do not bring
matches, lighters,</i>

<i>or sharp objects of any kind.</i>

<i>We await your confirmation

<i>Yours most truly,

<i>and Nephew Galerie concern.</i>

Or, alternatively,
just, I don't know.

Maw, nobody has an eye for

Why the fuck

Are they painted

Oh, no. What has he done?

You fucking asshole.

Are you seeing this?

Well, I think it's utterly wonderful.
It's crucial!

It's probably a turning point in

rustle them pictures loose.

We're in a maximum-security

It's federal property.

nightmare would require years

of negotiation with
a team of highly-paid,

a case of mistaken identity.

Have you been in the chicken
coop for a very long while?

Monsieur <i>Nescaffier,</i>
<i>even during his apprenticeship</i>

<i>in a provincial
fire department,</i>

<i>aspired to a lofty perch,</i>

<i>and there can be no higher
position in the</i> metier <i>than that of</i>

Chef Cuisinier
<i>for the private dining room</i>

<i>of the</i> Commissaire
de la Police Municipale.

(CLOCK TICKING)

Forgive my tardiness.

No, not at all.
Not at all.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(IN ENGLISH) Mr. Wright,
may I present my mother

Louise de la Villatte.
You can call her Maman.

We all do.
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur.</i>

THE COMMISSAIRE: This is my oldest
friend, Chou-fleur.

When I met him,
he was a girlish little schoolboy

with ringlets
and a full set of teeth.

Now, he looks like a corpse.
(CHUCKLES)

In the corner,
Patrolman Maupassant.

He'll be serving.

Cocktails.
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

THE COMMISSAIRE:
And this is my son, Gigi,

in the crime-lab smock.

What are you stealing
from my personal records?

Unsolved cases.

THE COMMISSAIRE:
Well, say hello to Mr. Wright.

Hello, Mr. Wright.

Hello, Gigi.

<i>Full name,
Isadore Sharif de la Villatte.</i>

<i>The Commissaire
and his only son,</i>

<i>widowered and motherless,
left the colony where the boy was born,</i>

<i>cemented together
by their shared grief.</i>

<i>Gigi was six.</i>

(SIREN BLARING)
<i>His schoolrooms</i>

<i>were the station house
and the squad car.</i>

<i>He was educated
by forensic tutors</i>

<i>in the traditions
of law enforcement.</i>

<i>His first drawings
were facial composites</i>

<i>based on eyewitness testimony.</i>

<i>His first words were in Morse code.</i>
(BEEPING)

<i>It was, I suppose,
wonderfully obvious.</i>

<i>He was brought up to succeed
the Commissaire himself.</i>

Yes, I've read you.
In the magazine.

To your satisfaction?

Of course. Of course.

Good writer.

I trust you are already
familiar with this genius.

At least by reputation.

Lieutenant Nescaffier.

I surely am.

<i>On three overlapping

<i>I have always been content

<i>As you know by now,</i>

<i>we have kidnapped your son</i>

to a secure location</i>

<i>Release or execute the Abacus</i>

ROEBUCK: <i>The getaway and eventual
motor pursuit was rendered vividly,</i>

<i>if, perhaps, a bit fancifully,
in a comic strip</i>

<i>published the following week.</i>

(CAR ENGINE STOPS)

(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)

<i>Though the infamous
Ennui gang war</i>

<i>"Winter Crimewave"
had eradicated</i>

<i>a healthy number of
thugs and hooligans,</i>

<i>it had also claimed the lives</i>

<i>of a disgraceful proportion
of innocent citizens.</i>

<i>Due to the surprise capture
of the racketeering accountant</i>

<i>Albert "the Abacus",</i>

<i>in possession of a valise
containing payroll stubs</i>

<i>for all three of
the city's major syndicates,</i>

<i>the law-abiding community's hopes
for an accelerated resolution</i>

<i>to the crisis had been renewed.</i>
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

(SIREN BLARING)

<i>However, this turn of events
had forcefully rattled the cages</i>

<i>of the denizens
of the criminal underworld.</i>


For myself, I had failed
to recognize the Abacus,

but as it happened,
I knew the chicken coop.

This is not in the article,
by the way.

If I refer to Mr. Howitzer,
do you know who I mean?

Of course.
Arthur Howitzer, Jr.

Founder and editor
of <i>The French Dispatch.</i>

It was my first week in Ennui
when I suffered the misfortune

of being arrested in
a drinking establishment

on the fringes of
the Flop Quarter

along with a number of
newly-found companions.

What was the charge?

Love.

You see, people may or may
not be mildly threatened

by your anger,
your hatred, your pride,

but love the wrong way

and you will find yourself
in great jeopardy.

In this case, a chicken coop
jail cell for six days straight.

I had no one who cared to rescue me,
and no one who cared to scold me.

And the only local number committed
to my typographic memory was

<i>Printer's District 9-2211.</i>

ARTHUR: <i>While I regret
we are unable</i>

<i>to publish either
of these specific pieces,</i>

<i>I would be very pleased to consider
other submissions in the future.</i>

<i>Or if you find yourself
in Ennui...</i>

ROEBUCK: <i>I'd never
met the man.</i>

<i>I knew how to reach him
only because I wanted a job.</i>

ARTHUR: Let's see here.

High school newspaper,
poetry club, drama society.

Wrote the school song.
Words and music.

Junior researcher, cub
reporter, assistant editor.

Fires and murders.

That's how I started.

My father owned
the paper, of course.

Bit of sports, bit of crime,
bit of politics.

Shortlisted twice,
Best Essays.

Deep South, Midwest,
East Coast.

Vast country.

Haven't been there
in 20 years.

Not now. I'm conducting
a job interview.

Your writing samples are good.
I re-read them in the taxi.

Have you ever done
any book reviews?

Never.

You're gonna be in there another few
hours before they process you out.

Read this.
Give me 300 words.

I'll pay you 500 francs minus
the 250 I advanced for your bail,

but I'll re-advance that
against cost of living.

Bring me a first draft
tomorrow morning

and however you go
about it, Mr. Wright,

try to make it sound like you
wrote it that way on purpose.

Thank you.

No crying.

It came to be known as the
"Night of a Thousand Slugs."

I'm reciting again.

<i>How the Commissaire and his elite
team of experts and analysts</i>

<i>succeeded so swiftly in determining
the location of the kidnappers' lair...</i>

<i>Well...</i>

<i>I just don't know.</i>

<i>The tools of the trade,
I suppose.</i>

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

ROEBUCK: (IN ENGLISH)
<i>But succeed they did.</i>

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

(TRAIN PASSING BY)

<i>Who were they?</i>

<i>It was later revealed.</i>

<i>A hired crew of
bandits and gunmen</i>

<i>imported by the ranking bosses
of the Ennui rackets</i>

<i>and their network
of underworld middlemen.</i>

<i>Chauffeur Joe Lefevre,
a once almost promising instrumentalist.</i>

<i>Stetson, Spinster,
and Hieronymus Von Altman,</i>

<i>Dutch masterminds.</i>

<i>Marconi Brutelli,
the Mediterranean anarchist.</i>

<i>A pair of hooligans,
estranged cousins.</i>

<i>A trio of showgirls,
all junkies.</i>

<i>Plus one small,
resourceful prisoner,</i>

<i>determined to free himself
and reduce taxpayer expense.</i>

(TAPPING ON METAL)

What's that noise?

(COIN CLATTERS)

Uh, air bubbles in the radiator pipes.
It's pressurized.

Sounds like Morse code.

Vaguely, maybe.

I'm Gigi, by the way.
What's your name?

I'm not gonna tell you that.
This is a felony.

You're not a criminal.
You're just a mixed-up showgirl.

Ha.
Ha, yourself.

Shut up.

What color eyes
do you have?

Blue?

Hello.

Hello.

Sing me a lullaby.

I'm scared.

(SINGING IN FRENCH)

(BOTH SINGING)

(IN ENGLISH)
Are you asleep?

GIGI: <i>Uh-huh.</i>

ROEBUCK: <i>The Commissaire adored
Gigi with all his voluminous heart.</i>

<i>However, his mind,</i>

<i>that exceptional machine
for the detection</i>

<i>and investigation
of criminal activity,</i>

<i>had been whirring
since dinnertime.</i>

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

<i>Diner.</i>
<i>Diner.</i>

ROEBUCK: (IN ENGLISH) <i>And he was in a
condition of dire calorific depletion.</i>

<i>Nescaffier, back in the field</i>

<i>for the first time
in six years,</i>

<i>came prepared to dazzle.</i>

<i>Diner.</i>

ROEBUCK: (IN ENGLISH)
<i>The change was instantaneous.</i>


Nescaffier.

ROEBUCK: <i>Even as
the faintest hints</i>

<i>of the aromas of
the great chef's kitchen</i>

<i>ribboned into
the Commissaire's nostrils,</i>

<i>he began to
envision and formulate</i>

<i>a multi-pronged battle-plan.</i>

<i>To start...</i>

<i>Deviled eggs of
the precinct canary</i>

<i>served in shells of
its own meringue.</i>

(PHONE RINGING)

(IN ENGLISH) May I
interrupt with a question?

Please.
Forgive me.

Just permit me to dog-ear
the page. Mentally.

I beg your pardon.

You've written about
the American negro,

the French intellectual,

the Southern romantic...
And the anti-negro.

The anti-negro.

Scripture, mythology,
folklore,

true crime, false crime,

the ghost story, the
picaresque, the bildungsroman.

But more than anything,
over all these years,

you've written about food.

Why?

Who? What? Where? When?
How? Valid questions,

but I learned
as a cub stringer,

never, under any circumstance,

if it is remotely within your
power to resist the impulse,

never ask a man why.

It... It tightens a fellow up.

I apologize,
but I'm gonna

hold you to it...
Torture.

...if you'll agree.

Self-reflection is a vice best
conducted in private or not at all.

Well,

I'll answer your question
out of sheer weariness,

but I truly don't know
what I'm about to say.

There is a particular
sad beauty

well-known to the
companionless foreigner

as he walks the
streets of his adopted,

preferably moonlit, city.
In my case, Ennui, France.

I have so often...

I have so often shared the day's
glittering discoveries with

no one at all.

But always, somewhere along
the avenue or the boulevard,

there was a table
set for me.

A cook, a waiter, a bottle,
a glass, a fire.

I chose this life.

It is the solitary feast that has
been very much like a comrade,

my great comfort
and fortification.

TALK SHOW HOST: <i>Do you remember
where you placed the bookmark?</i>

Of course, silly goose.
"Meanwhile."

"Meanwhile,
across the street..."

(TAPPING CONTINUES)

ROEBUCK: <i>During a lull in the
skirmish, an ancient concierge,</i>

<i>veteran of two wars,
limped across the street</i>

<i>to deliver
an enigmatic message.</i>

(FEEDBACK WHINES)

I'm speaking to the leader of the
gang of kidnappers on the top floor.

Do you have a working
kitchen in your lair?

My son needs a snack.

Allow us to send in
our precinct cook

along with some supplies
and provisions.

He will prepare a supper
of sufficient proportions

to feed you
and all your accomplices.

We already ate.

(ALL MURMURING)

THE CHAUFFEUR:
Is it an underling

or Nescaffier himself?

Blackbird pie.

(THE CHAUFFEUR GRUNTS)

ROEBUCK: <i>Required, of course,
to sample each item,</i>

<i>the chef ate
the deathly poison.</i>

(LOW INDISTINCT CHATTER)

For the little boy.

Stop.

Write down the recipe.



ROEBUCK:
<i>But Nescaffier survived,</i>

<i>thanks to
the extreme fortitude,</i>

<i>bolstered and braced,
season upon season,</i>

<i>by the richest,
most potent plates,</i>

<i>pans, and sauce pots</i>

<i>of his almost
superhuman stomach.</i>

<i>He knew well, of course,</i>

<i>Gigi loathed and despised
the radish in all its forms</i>

<i>with a deep,
unbridled passion,</i>

<i>and had never
so much as touched one</i>

<i>or even spoken the word,</i>

<i>during his entire
young lifetime.</i>

<i>However, as it happened,</i>

<i>the chauffeur
hated radishes, too.</i>

ROEBUCK: <i>Perhaps the most

<i>witnessed over the trajectory of that
protracted dinner date was this...</i>

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(GIGI SNIFFLES)
(SOBBING)

ROEBUCK: <i>A delicious irony.</i>

Monsieur <i>Albert,</i>
<i>accountant to the</i> demi-monde

<i>and remote cause of the entire
spectacular contretemps,</i>

<i>had been forgotten
in the chicken coop</i>

<i>from Thursday dinner
to Monday breakfast</i>

<i>and had very nearly
starved in his cell.</i>

It was only the convalescent
<i>Monsieur</i> Nescaffier himself

who retained
the presence of mind

to prepare the prisoner
an <i>omelette a la policier,</i>

which he delivered warm,

wrapped in a day-old
search warrant.

The Abacus ate well
that morning.

A word from
Gemini tooth powder.


It was supposed to be an
article about a great chef.

ROEBUCK: It is in part.

For the Tastes
and Smells section...

ROEBUCK: I understand.
The assignment was perfectly clear.

Perhaps,
you fail to grasp

that I was shot at and
hand-grenaded against my will.

I only asked to be fed,

and was, marvelously,
as I described in some detail.

Nescaffier only gets
one line of dialogue.

Well, I did cut something he told me.
It made me too sad.

I could stick it
back in, if you like.

What did he say?

(MUNCHING CONTINUES)


(LOW INDISTINCT CHATTER)
MAN: Martin... Martin...

Guillaume Martin.


I beg your pardon?

The toxic salts
in the radishes...

they had a flavor.

Totally unfamiliar to me.

Like a bitter,
moldy, peppery,

spicy, oily kind of

earth.

I never tasted
that taste in my life.

Not entirely pleasant,

extremely poisonous,

but still, a new flavor.

That's a rare thing
at my age.

I admire your bravery,
Lieutenant.

I'm not brave.

I just wasn't

in the mood to be

a disappointment
to everybody.

I'm a foreigner, you know.

This city is full
of us, isn't it?

I'm one myself.

Seeking something missing.

Missing something
left behind.

Maybe with good luck,

we'll find
what eluded us

in the places
we once called home.

(MUNCHING CONTINUES)

That's the best part
of the whole thing.

That's the reason
for it to be written.

I couldn't agree less.

Well, anyway,
don't cut it.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Are we all here?

I guess you know.
It was a heart attack.


<i>Excusez-moi.</i>


No crying.

Is somebody coming
to take him away?

There's a strike
at the morgue.

Who was with him?

He was alone.

Reading birthday telegrams.
(LIGHTER CLICKS)

Psst.

Don't light the candles.
He's dead.

I'll have a slice.

Me, too.

We need to draft something.
Who wants it?

We've got a file.

I'm working on the art.

SAZERAC: That's him.

Let's write it together.

Hmm, write what?
ALL: The obituary.
