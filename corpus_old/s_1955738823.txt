(wicked music)

(thunder booms)

Dear Heavenly Father,

I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit

in the name of Jesus Christ.

No weapon formed against me shall prosper,

for I wear the full armor of God.

I declare that Satan is
beneath me and shall remain so.

I ask that his angels protect
this town and these brave men.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

Hello?

Hello?

That dude at the antique shop

said meet behind the
Devil's Dune at midnight.

Hello?

Yes.

I am here.

I got it, a human tooth.

Show it to me.

How long has it been in your family?

God, a long time,

since 1897, I think.

My grandfather got it
from my great-grandfather.

May I see it?

[Young Man] It's bound with silver wire,

hung from a length of black sinew.

It's just what you asked about, man.

(creepy music)

This is it.

That means you'll pay me now?

Do you understand that
this goes far beyond money

and family?

Yeah, whatever, dude, that's
between you and your tooth.

I just wanna get paid.

(ominous music)

So we're cool?

No.

We are not.

(young man screams)

(suspenseful music)

(vampire growling)

Slick bastard.

You beat me to him, didn't you?

(eerie music)

Wow.

What in the hell is this?

You had to go and turn
archaeologists on me, didn't you?

This is supposed to be
a restoration, isn't it?

Look at this cross.

This is old.

Older than this church.

Looks like it was brought
in from some other site.

And this, what is this?

That would be a stick.

Look.

Restoration is a new route
from these sewer pipes.

This is an interruption.

If we have to start
digging around this thing,

it's not gonna cost you,

it's gonna cost me.

What was I supposed to do, ignore it,

just wait for it to crawl
out on its own and walk away?

It's late.

Look, we'll call the
church in the morning.

They're probably gonna wanna
send somebody out here now.

Thanks a lot for all this.

Let's get out of here.

I don't know why you're mad at me.

It's not my fault.

Wait wait wait wait wait

(girl groans)

Oh whoa, girl, wait, it's all right.

Look, you can keep that coat,

because obviously you
need it more than I do.

Look, I ain't gonna do nothing.

Just give me my wallet.

That's all I want.

It's hard to talk.

Yeah?

Okay.

How about that?

Here you go.

Okay, you don't like the pen.

How about a pencil?

Okay.

You must've went to public school.

Main Street.

You gonna have to be a

There's Main Street

Oh you mean Main Street in Old Town.

Yeah, that's by the riverfront.

That's west.

Wait wait wait wait wait!

Hold on.

Okay.

All right now, eat up.

You probably need to get you some iron,

because you looking a little pale.

(mysterious music)

Hey!

Where you going?

(sirens whirring in the distance)

Kind of late.

Want to bunk here tonight?

I got some blankets and I got a pillow.

I got blankets and we could make a spot,

get warm,

get some real sleep.

What you got in the bag?

Smells good, whatever it is.

Wanna share?

I got some water.

This is good.

This is really good.

What else you got in there?

Oh dear lord,

is that a pickle?

I can't tell you the last time it's been

For a while now.

(punching and grunting)

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I guess that blade was supposed

to be sticking out of me right now,

instead of you.

Yeah, it was.

That's all right,
because now I got my gun.

(gunshots firing)

Go ahead, kill me.

(gunshots firing)

Ow!

Ah!

(metallic slashing)

(teakettle whistling)

[Julian] Are you ever gonna tell me

what you're marking on this map?

Been hearing stories.

With all due respect, sir,

I've been hearing stories for years,

incredible stories.

Are they true?

Don't need to trouble yourself

with rumors and urban legends.

[Julian] Watching people
count on their faith

to save them as the world
around them crumbles,

that's troubling.

Rumors and urban legends,
that I understand.

Do you?

Because once you're inside,
there's no turning back.

You won't easily forget
what I will tell you.

[Julian] I have lived my
entire life as a soldier.

I have never run from a fight.

Surely you aren't asking
me these questions now

after all this time

because you heard things.

Tell me why you ask now.

[Julian] You know I've had visions,

as a child.

[Bishop] You've had visions?

[Julian] Yes.

[Bishop] Visions of things to come?

[Julian] Yes.

[Bishop] And you're having
them again now, aren't you?

[Julian] Yes, in my dreams.

Tell me exactly what you see.

[Julian] An orchid,

one that's been blooming
for years and years.

The blooms wither and
turn black overnight.

Then I see a face rising up towards me

out of the darkness.

[Bishop] We function in a world today

where the very word of
God is being questioned.

The church is either doubted or feared.

Men of coffer are implicated
in scandal after scandal.

One of the few things that
the world does not yet know

is that the church tends to those things

that no one notices,

things that make our lives so much easier,

things taken for granted,

things that if not properly dealt with,

could bring daily life to a halt,

things that people don't want
to know about or deal with.

They only want it taken care of.

(eerie music)

[Julian] That's her,
the face in my dreams.

We knew it was just a matter of time

before she came back.

Men with your ability
have helped us before.

You think it a coincidence
that you're here

under my supervision?

(phone rings)

Yes?

I know, where?

I know exactly where that is.

I'll be there within the hour.

Excuse me?

The reading was neutral.

I understand.

(vexed music)

(airplane roars overhead)

(yearning music)

Excuse me.

Yeah?

I understand you uncovered
some artifacts yesterday

while you were digging.

You from the church?

Yes, I am.

I'm here to evaluate the
importance of the pieces.

It's right this way.

Check this out.

What do you think?

Was this here yesterday?

No, it wasn't.

Listen, I want you to be careful,

because I don't need you falling

through any sinkhole
or anything, all right?

I'll be very careful.

You found two artifacts, right?

Yeah.

May I see the other one?

Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go get it.

(mysterious music)

(digger laughs)

Check this baby out.

Thank you.

What do you think?

Do we have an artifact or what?

No.

Not really, I'm sorry to say.

The cross is old and might be a piece

of one of the original
structures from the area,

but I don't think it's a significant find.

The wooden post,

just a marker.

Probably left over from
a crew at the time.

Sorry to disappoint you.

I can have a few people
out here this afternoon

and we'll get this stuff out of your way.

Seen a woman around here?

She would've looked like a homeless woman,

Why you care?

Have you seen her?

Yeah.

I seen a woman in pretty bad shape.

Somebody messed her up.

Know anything about that?

Yeah I do.

If I could find her,

I could help her get it straightened out.

No.

Oh I done stared down the

so you gonna have to do more
than that to impress me.

Why don't you face me like a man?

(veiled music)

Yeah, I seen her.

She was here last night, about 10:00.

She don't look like that no more,

but she was here.

She happen to say where she was going?

She couldn't talk.

She wrote it down though.

She was looking for Old Main
Street up by the riverfront,

so I pointed her west.

That's it?

Gave her some food, a
coat, some old rubber boats.

She went up that there road.

That's absolutely everything?

Hey what, that's it?

Hey man, I don't know who
you are or where you live,

but you better not be
the one that hurt her,

and you owe me 50 bucks for the radio!

(ominous music)

This is Julian.

Put me through.

Yes, sir, it's her.

I'm positive.

It's Laura.

Plain burger, would you
like anything else with that?

Is it too late to
add some cheese please?

No.

You look beautiful.

Beautiful is not enough.

I want him to be powerless against me,

you can't be in here.

Anybody in there?

[Man] Well yes, but originally

I brought them in from France.

(knocking on the door)

[Laura's Father] Welcome, Pastor.

I'm so glad you came.

It's good to be here.

Bless you for having me.

[Laura's Mother] Please
make yourself at home.

The entire family is here tonight.

Does that mean I'll have an opportunity

to speak with your charming daughter?

Oh Pastor, I wish you would.

I do not like the type she
has been seen with lately.

[Laura's Mother] Our friends
say they've caught glimpses

of our girl talking to
some tall, dark stranger

who's new in town.

Have you asked her about him?

Yes.

She denies knowing anything about it.

I'm about to take a hand to her.

Please, Mr. Wolff, I hope
that won't be necessary.

Would you mind if I speak with her?

You know how fond I am of your daughter.

Maybe she'll confide in me.

Oh Pastor, as far as we're concerned,

you have our permission to
take her under your wing.

We have the utmost
respect for you, Pastor.

I think she would do well too,

allowing herself with
a man of your caliber.

May I pour you a glass of wine?

That would be wonderful.

Consider her under my counsel, Mr. Wolff.

You clean up nice.

We should go somewhere and talk,

Hey hey hey, where are you going?

I just wanna get to know you better.

Can't I get to know you better?

Have a lovely evening.

Shall we?

Hey!

They took a lot of stuff.

Ma'am, you don't have an inventory list,

you don't know the value of the items.

The boots.

Right, you know the value of the boots,

but none of the other items.

Plus, you told us you
didn't actually see anyone.

Ma'am, do you have any security cameras?

No.

with as much detail as you can remember.

Suspect is a white female with brown hair

unknown direction of travel.

Ma'am, stop.

Come over here, we need to talk to you.

Come over here.

David 3, we are at Grant and Hickory

with possible suspect.

[Cop On Radio] David 2 clear.

We are questioning witnesses.

Detain suspect.

David 3 clear.

Put your hands on your head for me.

Take it easy, ma'am.

We're just looking for
weapons right now, that's all.

Where you coming from?

And where are you headed now?

I think we've got ourselves a mute.

There you go.

(mysterious music)

Main Street.

What, you got family there?

Hey, hey, can you write down on there

and tell us where you
were about 20 minutes ago.

We got a homeless guy.

Sounds like he got the crap
kicked out of him pretty good.

martial artist, would you?

A little enthusiastic about self-defense?

[Cop On Radio] David 2 to David 3.

Witness reports the suspect
had some type of trauma

to her neck,

possibly a big cut.

Says she covered it up with a scarf.

David 3 clear, checking now.

Ma'am, can you take
off the scarf for me?

All right, just put your
hands behind your back.

She's gonna bolt.

Hey, don't make this
any harder on yourself

than it has to be!

Damn, that was fast.

Did you see that?

Don't ever let them see you
coming with your cuffs out.

David 3 to David 2, suspect has fled.

Moving north through Grant Park.

Establish a perimeter
from Grant to Market.

(sirens whirring)

(dramatic music)

Stop!

Ah!

I said stop!

Stay where you are!

(urgent music)

Okay, if that's the way you wanna play it.

I got her!

Over here.

Watch out for the wires!

suspect headed west towards Hamilton.

She's gotta come through here.

David 3 and David 2 in position

at the West Gate of Grant Park.

Will intercept suspect and detain.

Damn!

and is now moving through
the Westwood area.

Hey, are we going after her?

(frenzied music)

Laura, stop!

(dramatic music)

(sirens whirring)

(ominous music)

I do not want to hear an explanation.

I do not want to hear an excuse.

You will apologize to the Pastor.

I will not!

You will.

You will because I say you will.

Who do you think you are?

Your mother and I approve of this man.

Do you approve of him
touching me like that?

Shut your mouth!

Why do you speak about him that way?

Are you trying to turn us against him?

You can do no better in this town.

I've already done better.

Ah,

your special little friend.

You will not be seeing
that intruder again.

Yes I will.

And you cannot stop me.


(weighty music)

Then I will pray for you, Julian.

And I will pray for Laura.

If there's hope for any of them,

there's hope for her.

(knocking on the door)


So good to see you, Julian.

I hope the shoulder is feeling better.

Feeling much better.

Healing up very well.

Glad to hear it.

I don't think you know how
important you are to us.

Actually, I think I do.

Who did this belong to?

Originally?

Laura.

Are you sure?

I took it off the man in the alley.

He called himself Lazarus.

You can appreciate the irony in that.

I believe he was using it to track Laura.

Luckily I got to him
before he could get to her.

I trust you will treat that and seal it.

When the time is right, I'll
use it to track her myself.

I see that you got my little gift.

Yes.

You want me to start catching
stray dogs and cats now?

It's something to consider, Julian.

We must make a better
attempt to save them.

Your treatment of Lazarus was shameful.

Oh please.

They're people, Julian.

They have souls.

We must make an attempt to save them.

The church is demanding that we try.

The church has no
idea what they're like.

But Julian, what has happened to you?

What has happened to your faith?

If you were in that
alley with me, you'd know.

I wish I could see the
humanity in them, I really do.

Every time I go out there,

I hope I will see something
that will change my mind,

give me some reason to have

faith in them.

Then I'm forced to kill another one.

You're forced?

Yes, forced.

Do you think I actually enjoy this?

(troubled music)

Why all the sudden concern?

I've been studying the Wolff file,

reading over the accounts
of what happened,

Laura's part in all of it.

Julian, I believe Laura
to be completely innocent

in this entire affair.

This woman has been betrayed by everyone

and everything around her.

She had no way out, no chance.

What will you do if you
find her reading good

or even neutral?

I'll do my job like I always do.

Even if her reading is good?

She won't stay good for long.

Look, Julian, the normal,
average person would--

Placed under those circumstances,

too much temptation.

You have to trust me on this.

How can you be sure?

Because I know what I've seen.

But is this the right thing?

It's the necessary thing.

And what if you're wrong?

Then I'll pay the price for it!

(somber music)

Then I will pray for you, Julian.

And I will pray for Laura.

If there's hope for any of
them, there's hope for her.

Will you at least try to save her?

(perplexed music)

(emotional music)

(chattering on police radio)

(peaceful music)

Don't move!

Let me see your hands.

Holy...

Did you see that?

Where'd she go?

I don't know.

Is she still even in the yard?

(eerie music)

(gunshot fires)

Frank 1, 1030, 1030, officer is down.

(fretful music)

Frank 4, suspect sighted
at the 1100 block of Main.

She just cut between the
bar and the restaurant,

heading west into the alley.

(suspenseful music)

(grunting and thudding)

Ma'am, come out from under
there now, right now!

(suspenseful music)

(gunshots firing)

Frank 4, shots fired,
shots fired, officers down!

(thrilling music)

(nostalgic music)

(dart gun fires)

Stay down!

Stay down!

Listen to me very carefully.

The peace officers will be
catching up with us any second.

You do not want that.

They do not understand who you
are or where you came from,

but I do.

I'm going to give you one
chance to come with me.

It's going to be my way and
it's going to be peaceful,

or I will kill you.

Do you understand?

Do you understand?

Don't move!

Drop your weapons!

Let me see your hands!

This is a DOD matter.

I said drop your weapons
and let me see your hands!

(troubled music)

Oh, this is gonna be fun.

(suspenseful music)

Dear God, please help me.

(sirens whirring)

Finally.

What the hell is going on here?

This man claims to be DOD.

He has this.

That crazy woman is hiding in the church.

I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding, Mr. Hess.

What?!

You have my department's
full cooperation.

I'm going in alone.

Deploy your men around the church.

Set up a perimeter.

If the woman inside gets past me,

you'll have to act very quickly,

and call for backup.

(scary music)

(glass shattering)

(Laura coughs)

(dart gun fires)

Why are you doing this to me?

I'm trying to save you.

I've been trying to save you all along,

from the first time I saw you.

Save me?

Laura, do you remember the Pastor?

He was trying to save you too.

Save me?

The Pastor wanted to possess me

and show me off like a trophy.

He did not love me.

No, that's not true.

Laura, he was trying to free your soul.

You don't know what's been done to you.

I don't know?

You have no idea what I've been through.

Stay where you are.

I mean it.

I'll put a stake right through your heart.

What has become of me?

Where is my life, my memories?

You fell in love with the Devil.

Let me hear your confession.

Let me draw the evil out of you.

What did you do to me?

You did this to yourself.

(gun fires)

(tense music)

Enough!

Who are you?

Turn and face me.

(spooky music)

(Lazarus laughs)

(Laura gasps for air)

(gun fires)

(Lazarus screams)

(Laura gasps for air)

(Laura growls)

Come on!

(dramatic music)

There she is!

Come on, she's getting away!


I'm sorry.

Tie her up.

(dark music)

(thunder rumbles)
(church bells tolling)

(thunder booms)

Go up to the new church site

and look for a crate marked All Saints.

Bring it here.

(wicked music)

Dear Heavenly Father,

I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit

in the name of Jesus Christ.

(Laura growls)

No weapon formed against me shall prosper,

for I wear the full armor of God.

I declare that Satan is
beneath me and shall remain so.

I ask that his angels protect
this town and these brave men

in the name of Jesus Christ.

Amen.

(evil music)

(Laura coughs)

(flesh slicing)

(thunder rumbling)
(church bells tolling)

(heavy breathing)

(Laura groaning)

Get thee down, untamed beast!

(gunshots firing)

Go ahead, kill me.

If I can't see my Laura again,

I don't wanna live like this anymore.

(gunshots firing)

[Julian] I took it off
the man in the alley.

[Bishop] I trust you will
treat that and seal it.

(dramatic music)

(thunder booming)

(Laura screams)

(glass shattering)

(Laura sobs)

(sad music)

(glass shattering)

(warlike music)

Go go go!

Move it!

All right, guys, stay close, come on.

(warlike music)


Hands, let me see your hands!

Get down on the ground, now!

Or else we will deploy.

(gun fires)

Move!

(Laura growls)

(dramatic music)

Williams, Williams, you all right?

Clark, you all right back there?

Clark!

Williams!

Down!

(gunshots firing)

(officer screams)


[Cop] Go go go go go!

(suspenseful music)

Shh.

(expressive music)

[Bishop Voiceover] Then I
will pray for you, Julian,

and I will pray for Laura.

If there's hope for any of
them, there's hope for her.

â™« I just need you

â™« When will I be okay

â™« With a story that's not my own

â™« Story that's not my own

â™« How can I live every moment with truth

â™« When you're there
through all I've been given

â™« When will I be okay

â™« When will I be okay

â™« With a story that's not my own

â™« How can I live every moment with truth

â™« When you're there
through all I've been given

â™« When will I be okay
