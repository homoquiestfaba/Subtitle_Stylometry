[upbeat music playing]

Hi. Unlike you, I'm Rob Lowe,
and I love movies.

The fact is, I'd rather be watching
a movie than doing this right now.

But let's pretend I didn't say that
and just enjoy each other's company.

Thousands of movies
are released every year.

That's a lot of stories,

even though
according to screenwriting theory

there are only seven basic plots:
overcoming the monster...

and the other six.

It's little wonder that stock characters,

familiar story beats,
and convenient plot devices

have crept in over time.

Tonight, we celebrate the clichÃ©s
that have made cinema what it is today:

struggling for relevance
in the aftermath of a pandemic.

<i>Over the next hour,
we'll be looking at Tinseltown's habit</i>

<i>of using
these handy cinematic tropes in...</i>

Attack of the Hollywood ClichÃ©s!

<i>We'll be asking questions like,</i>

<i>"Why do women being chased
by large, scary dinosaurs</i>

<i>have to do it in high heels?"</i>

<i>As we build to some
of my favorite clichÃ©s,</i>

<i>we'll be looking at some of the most
dramatic moments in cinema.</i>

<i>Some of the most controversial.</i>

Sister is teaching the mothers
how to wash their children.

to a form of high art.</i>

[tires screech]

<i>And of course,
how Hollywood deals with sex.</i>

<i>And violence.</i>

And where better to begin
than with a familiar beginning,

from the world of romantic comedy,
it's the meet cute.

<i>That magical moment in movies
when the love begins.</i>

People watch romcoms to get high.

<i>They wanna experience
that first sensation of love</i>

<i>so that when they see those two people
meet for the very first time,</i>

<i>when that moment, that spark,</i>

<i>that chemistry happens,</i>

it feels so real to them

that they have that sensation
in their body.

There's always some funny, contrived
reason why you have the two people

who are gonna fall in love meet,

<i>because it has to be interesting.</i>

<i>They can't meet
the way regular people meet.</i>

Lady, keep driving.
[screams] Get out!

Some kind of embarrassing,
comedic, unlikely scenario...

that brings the two together.

I live just over the street.
I have, um, water and soap.

You can get cleaned up.


you would throw
the rest of your juice in their face.

You'd be like, "No, get away from me."

In five minutes,
we can have you spick and span

and back on the street again,

in the non-prostitute sense, obviously.

fall in love in a film,</i>

<i>whatever the genre, the clichÃ©s
of cinematic romance are ever present.</i>

I hate the water,
and I hate being wet, and I hate you!

Good!

They don't like each other,
are engaged or married to someone else.

Jack, I'm engaged.

I'm marrying Cal.

There has to be a struggle
to go through or else it would be boring.


<i>male strategies vary from annoying
persistence to outright harassment.</i>

Well, how about this for a coincidence?

A lot of films which are shown
from the male point of view

feature what you would
really call stalking.

You wanna dance with me?

No.

Why not?

Because I don't want to.

Well, will you go out with me?
What?

No!
No?

No!
No?

Hey, pal, she just told you.
Why not?

Like in <i>Twilight,</i> when he
climbs up through her window

<i>and says, "I like watching you sleep."</i>

Do you do that a lot?

Just the past couple of months.

Stalking is sexy only applies
when it's men stalking women.

When women are persistent
or stalking male characters,

<i>they become the villain.</i>

I just wanna be a part of your life.

And this is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

What am I supposed to do?

You won't answer my calls,
you change your number.

I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan.

who commands attention,</i>

someone as unique, special,
and one-of-a-kind

as the lead in every other movie.

Since all aspects of your protagonists
have to be remarkable,

it's not enough for them
to just have a job.

Whatever that job is,
they gotta job the shit out of it,

especially if their job is the job:
the cop's job.

You think I'm crazy?
Yeah.


<i>if you want crimes solved
and the bad guys brought to justice,</i>

<i>top of the law-enforcement tree
is the maverick cop.</i>

Now, that's a real badge, I'm a real cop,
and this is a real fucking gun.

The maverick cop is a badass,
he doesn't listen to the chief.

You wanna play some bullshit cowboy cop,
go do it in somebody else's precinct.

They are completely dysfunctional.

He's probably an alcoholic,
terrible father.

You're my daughter, in my house,
and you'll respect me, got that?

Don't call me a fuck-up.
Why shouldn't I?

Mom calls you one.

They only care about the job.

No bullshit. You wanna kill yourself?

You know why I don't do it? The job.

Destroying everything in their path.

[gunshots]
[alarms blaring]


<i>but the poster boy for loose cannons
of law enforcement remains:</i>

<i>Clint Eastwood's</i> Dirty Harry.

You've got to ask yourself one question:

"Do I feel lucky?"
[alarm blaring]

Well, do you, punk?

example of this clichÃ©.</i>

That film tries so hard

to put us on the side
of this beaten-down cop

<i>who really just wants to let go
and shoot a bunch of people.</i>

[clicks]
[man gasps]

He exists by his own rules

<i>and he does what he has to do
to get criminals.</i>

It's painted that the legal system
is either incredibly stupid

or run by bleeding heart liberals.

What I'm saying is that man had rights.

Well, I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

that there's only two things</i>

<i>these cops care about,
and they're both shiny.</i>


where the maverick cop</i>

<i>hands in their gun and badge, like,</i>

"You are no longer someone
who should be in this position."

We know, the audience knows,
he's the only one who should have it.

You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

Just take a couple...


<i>Hollywood has moved away
from making maverick cop movies,</i>

<i>reflecting the disenchantment
with police officers</i>

<i>who take the law into their own hands.</i>

We are led to believe
that they're gonna do the right thing

morally and ethically.

The reality is,
that doesn't appear to be the case

with a lot of police officers.

It is something
that should be rethought by filmmakers,

TV producers, and it is being rethought.

hasn't taken an early retirement.</i>

<i>On TV, there's room for clichÃ©s</i>

<i>to be worked into
three-dimensional characters.</i>

<i>Kate Winslet's </i>Mare of Easttown

<i>has a complex internal life,
but don't worry,</i>

<i>she's still a cop who drinks hard,</i>

<i>bends the rules, gets suspended...</i>

Gun and badge.

<i>...but still gets her man.</i>

[gunshots]
[grunting]

Hollywood loves a winner,

but not every character
in your story can be a hero,

unless it's set in the Marvel Universe,
which only 96% of movies are.

Some characters are so destined to lose

from the moment they walk on screen,

that they might as well turn up
wearing a coffin and get it over with.

<i>You're a secondary character in a film.</i>

Thanks, John.


<i>You're planning on calling it a day.</i>

Tomorrow I'd like you to...

I'm resigning tomorrow, Frank.
What?


Al!

[dramatic sting plays]


American cinema loves to cue

people who are going to die by making
sure we know this is their last job.

<i>They're about to retire, right?</i>

I got three more days,
I wanna make the most of it.

Maybe there's a retirement party
planned for you later.

How about a speech?

<i>And you've just got one more shift to do.</i>



<i>to guarantee
death is just around the corner.</i>

One way, you'll hear a character
talk about his family,

about his aspirations...

And I will marry a round American
woman and raise rabbits.

If they start reflecting
on what they gonna do next... dead.

Often in war films as well,
it will be the G.I. or whatever,

<i>gets out a photo of his girlfriend...</i>

and it's probably been in his pocket
for a while. Big mistake.

Please. Please.
[dramatic music playing]

[bells tolling]
[Lowe] <i>So once you're dead onscreen,</i>

<i>your funeral will be attended
by loved ones</i>

<i>and a solitary figure who,
for some reason,</i>

<i>stands and stares from a long way away.</i>

<i>It also allows the director
to get the wide shot of the ceremony.</i>

<i>But </i>The Fast and the Furious
<i>takes it to another level.</i>

<i>While Paul Walker
watches a funeral from a distance,</i>

<i>Vin Diesel is watching Paul Walker

<i>from a distance.</i>

<i>Of course, once the funeral is over,</i>

<i>the grave site is the perfect setting</i>

<i>to show a character's
fragile emotional state.</i>

I love you.

Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

of explaining where we are in the plot.</i>

I remember everything you said
and I got it all figured out.


<i>And just in case you're not sure
who he's talking to...</i>

There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

<i>...the filmmakers
carved it on the headstone for you.</i>

<i>"His wife."</i>

<i>But it's not always just talking
going on in the graveyard.</i>

<i>Looks like there's one extra stiff
in the cemetery this morning.</i>

One of the things I love most about cinema

is the way it transports you
from your everyday life

into an entirely fictional fantasy land
like Narnia, or France.

[French folk music playing]
<i>The French have a word for clichÃ©s,</i>

<i>but in cinema, one of the most
clichÃ©d cities is Paris.</i>

<i>But how can we tell we're in Paris?</i>

<i>Because the director makes sure</i>

<i>we can see the Eiffel Tower
through the bedroom window.</i>

<i>The loft window.</i>

<i>The train window.</i>

<i>From the balcony.</i>

<i>Through a clock.</i>

<i>Unfortunately,</i>

<i>that means the Eiffel Tower is on the top
of every invaders' to-destroy list.</i>

Actors love working with props

because like all good co-stars,
they never hog the scenes.

And they're usually paid less.

An everyday seeming prop

can make even the most godlike figure
seem like a regular Joe.

Admit it, this grocery-bag baguette combo
I'm holding

has made me seem 26% more relatable.

I haven't bought or eaten bread
in over ten years.

The bag is only a cover

to stop me from inadvertently absorbing
the carbs through my skin.

All movie stars insist on it.

<i>Often, lead actors
have to come across as regular Joes</i>

<i>who do their own shopping,</i>

<i>and a highly visible baguette sticking
out of the bag is parfait pour la job.</i>

<i>It can also be ideal for hiding behind.</i>

<i>The intensity of the performance</i>

<i>is matched only
by the quantity of the bread.</i>

Still warm.
It's the best bread I ever tasted.


One expressive prop
that actors love is the apple,

despite it having
a shocking 19 grams of sugar.

Tell me when you got enough
so I can spit this shit out.

Eating in a scene
definitely is the cocky move.

It's kind of like the ultimate
"I'm here and I don't care."


<i>Killing off an enemy army.</i>

<i>Or snacking between meals
while meeting a superior officer.</i>

Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

<i>An apple is the clichÃ©d way of saying,</i>

<i>"I'm too cool for school,"</i>

<i>while lowering cholesterol
and promoting gut health.</i>

The way your movie is cast

depends on what kind of story
you're telling.

Some stories require a director
to thoughtfully curate

an ensemble
of subtly different personality types,

<i>and some movies
just need a big guy who kills people.</i>


Cinema likes
to tell us that the individual

can take on the system,

and one way it tells us this is possible
is via the one-man army.

<i>You can see this right back
in the sort of Robin Hood,</i>

<i>Errol Flynn films.</i>

<i>You can see it going right through
the Western genre.</i>

<i>You see it, arguably, in James Bond.</i>

It changed in the '80s

when your bodybuilders came into fashion.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, most famously,

Stallone, they all of a sudden
didn't really look like blokes we knew.

<i>They looked superhuman.</i>

When you get Stallone
behind that weapon of mass destruction.

<i>Twenty men being blown to smithereens.</i>

Totally satisfying experience
in carnage and destruction,

<i>with an absolute disregard
for human beings,</i>

um, which you want in those movies.

I think the invincibility
and the indomitability

of the '80s action movie macho hero

<i>became the key
for them becoming franchises.</i>

<i>And then </i>Die Hard<i> came in,</i>

<i>a film that starts out
relatively realistically.</i>

<i>Bruce Willis seems like an ordinary bloke.</i>

Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

Hang on, John!

<i>But then, by the time of part five,</i>

<i>basically, he could
take Superman down in part five.</i>

The skills
are being physically very capable,

<i>more than normal human beings.</i>

They tend to be very much
the strong, silent type.

The one place
where the one-man army will speak up

is immediately after
or just before killing somebody.

We're married.

[O'Hara] <i>The master of the form
is Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

Consider that a divorce.

Sure, your main character
can run around firing guns

and bazookas at every school bus
like the hero they are,

but if they wanna earn our respect,

there comes a time when they'll
have to throw down those firearms

and pick up their fists...

with both hands.


characters on screen had to
express themselves physically

because people got bored
with the intertitle.

<i>They laughed at the flowery prose.</i>

So, what you get was lengthy fight scenes.

<i>Officially,
the first staged fist-fight for film</i>

<i>was the big fight
on top of and inside a train</i>

<i>in </i>The Great Train Robbery.


<i>and we still have guys
beating up on each other</i>

<i>on moving trains,
just in slightly more expensive suits.</i>

Something that I've loved
seeing in the last ten years

is fight scenes getting more gritty
and gross to watch.

[man grunts]

The other kind of fantastic,
I think, clichÃ©,

that makes it more manageable
for us as an audience

is when all of the attackers
come out one by one.


<i>In </i>Oldboy,
in the amazing scene in the corridor,

you're placing your attention
on one kill at a time.

It's kind of very related
to video games, I think,

where this idea
that you might have all the skills

and you're punching through,
but it just never ends.

<i>is the legendary Jackie Chan.</i>

So Jackie Chan was my favorite.

<i>The reason he was so popular
is he went against clichÃ©</i>

<i>and became the hero
who gets beat up the whole movie.</i>

It's absurd what he's doing,

<i>and it's without wires,
and it's death-defying.</i>

<i>I feel like he's the person</i>

that has had the most influence.
And it's all in camera.

Now you have fist fights that,

<i>If you hit somebody 50 times

<i>well, pretty much forever.</i>

<i>In early cinema,
while studios pushed the boundaries</i>

<i>of taste and decency,</i>

<i>there was a growing pressure
to clean up their act</i>

<i>and not present women
as being so free and promiscuous.</i>

Take off your clothes,
get in here, and tell me all about it.

In the early 1930s, you had things
like Barbara Stanwyck in <i>Baby Face,</i>

who slept her way through the layers
of this giant New York bank.

Have you had any experience?
Plenty.

You had these Mae West characters

<i>the big studios had lost their grip
on all of the cinema chains.</i>

Independent cinemas had begun to sprout up

and they were bringing in
exciting new films from Europe,

<i>often which had exciting
and forbidden things like boobs.</i>

As more European films

Hollywood realized,

<i>which put sex back on screen,</i>

Sex in films

but at the same time,
it has its own stock set of clichÃ©s.

<i>Bras rarely ever fall off,

Sorry, did I scare you?

I didn't mean to.
I'm merely introducing our next clichÃ©:

The jump scare, which is...


who ran a low-budget unit</i>

<i>at RKO Pictures,</i>

<i>and he helped raise
a whole generation of filmmakers</i>

who knew how to use mood
to really get to you.

<i>In </i>Cat People,
<i>our heroine is being tracked,</i>

<i>creating a sense of terror.</i>

And of course the final hiss arrives.

[engine rumbling]
[hissing]

<i>Yet it's revealed
that it's actually a bus' brakes</i>

as it pulls up,
and the sequence ends that way.

anyone had used a false scare in cinema,</i>

<i>and the technique became known
as the "Lewton Bus."</i>

<i>Now the jump scare comes in many forms:</i>

<i>Things trying to get through
closed windows.</i>

<i>People throwing themselves against fencing
when you're having a hug.</i>

<i>And full-length coats.</i>


<i>Don't worry, it's not real leather.</i>

<i>Given that the first false scare ever</i>

<i>was from a bus
in a film called </i>Cat People,

<i>it's ironic that the filmmakers'
most clichÃ©d one today is...</i>

[screeches]
[screams]

<i>...the household cat.</i>

[cat screeches]
[gasps, then groans]

Cats are evil, and the clichÃ©
about them being scary

<i>is one of those clichÃ©s
that's completely based in fact.</i>

around the house hiding in closets.</i>


So they can scare a person.

isn't even limited to planet Earth.</i>


Cats are great for this,

<i>because they are beings who exist
with us in our domestic spaces</i>

but who couldn't give a shit
whether we live or die.


in a pet-free environment,</i>

<i>there's always an option
to make people jump with a mirror.</i>

[shower running]

A mirror scare is one of
the greatest clichÃ©s in all of movies.

[dramatic sting plays]

<i>They always work,</i>

because the idea that you're alone
and you shut the medicine cabinet,

and then suddenly there's something
behind you is terrifying.



<i>...it's an amazing moment.
It's great fun, though,</i>

that they can take something mundane
and give it that jolt, you know.

You're not real.

Every time we see a mirror,

or see somebody in a bathroom,
we're worried.

We are our most vulnerable
in the bathroom.

It's a very private place.
I think that that's easy to exploit.


You can also do fake-outs with that.

<i>You can put somebody into a bathroom</i>

<i>and you can build tension.</i>

<i>You don't have to have anything happen.</i>

[man screams]

scream in a movie,</i>

<i>chances are it could be our next clichÃ©.</i>

<i>But you probably didn't even realize it.</i>


The Wilhelm scream is a scream
that was recorded originally in 1951.

<i>The guy's walking through the Everglades,
then the alligator grabs his leg</i>

<i>and he goes: </i>[mimics scream]


Fast forward a couple of years later,

and some sound editor
is looking for a scream

<i>because poor Private Wilhelm
is struck by an arrow.</i>


Yeah, I'll just fill my pipe!


Out comes... Or let's say,
overlaid on top of him

is the Wilhelm scream.

began to show up in Hollywood</i>

<i>whenever a character was shot, pushed,
or obliterated by large plastic ants.</i>

[man screams]

<i>But when it was heard
in a galaxy far, far away,</i>

<i>it became an insider joke.</i>


It pops up in <i>Star Wars,</i>

then George Lucas, Steven Spielberg,

and everybody gets in on it.


It's an industry joke.
Uh, Tarantino uses it...


He's not using that by accident.

That's him absolutely tapping
into the clichÃ© of the sound.

[man screams]

There's something about the pitch of it,

and it's strangely kind of reassuring

that even in scenes of mayhem,
you will hear the Wilhelm scream.


It's such a ridiculous in-joke now.

We need a new scream, in my opinion.

Hollywood likes to think of itself
as a paragon of equality,

but apparently if you look closely,

using a microscope,
which was invented by a man,

there are occasional minor differences
in the way men and women are depicted.


<i>The Smurfette principle
refers to the lone woman</i>

<i>on a testosterone-infused adventure</i>

<i>who ensures the filmmakers
tick that diversity box.</i>


from the iconic Smurf world,</i>

<i>where Smurfette is the only lady
in a land full of Smurf dudes.</i>

[Smurfs whooping and whistling]

This is a trope you'll see in everything,
from kids' cartoons...

What are you doing? Get down.

I'll teach that boy a lesson.

...to <i>The Avengers...</i>

I'm always picking up after you boys.

<i>...to any kind of action film.</i>

["Cherry Bomb" playing]

It is the most cynical construct
in a movie

<i>where they'll stick a woman in there
to have the guys ogle her.</i>

What?

Or they'll stick in a woman
to look at the guys askance

<i>and tell them how immature they are.</i>

I don't understand the physics
of how my toes hurt.


Children. I work with children.

or leading lady,</i>

<i>chances are you'll find yourself
running to or from danger</i>

<i>in high heels.</i>


given a handicap to the women.</i>

<i>They can't run in these heels,
but they don't discard them.</i>

Even in recent films,

they're still staggering around
in the middle of the road.

The idea of women running in heels

goes back to the issue
of Hollywood glamorizing women

<i>to the point
which is completely impractical.</i>

and a leather outfit from a fetish store,</i>

<i>your heroine can become
even more cartoonishly depicted.</i>

Where I do take issue
is when a character decides

what I need if I'm gonna fight
a bunch of people is high heels.

Like Catwoman. You cannot fight
in those. You'll break an ankle.

It takes a female character
who's a badass action hero,

and it makes her phony.

Another pet peeve. Sex scenes
with bras and fighting with heels.

No, I'm not doing it. Not doing it.

stock female character clichÃ©s:</i>

<i>the manic pixie dream girl.</i>

Blah, blah, blah, blah!

I make a noise or I do something
no one has done before

and then I can feel unique again,
even for a second.

She is always extremely pretty,
she's always "quirky"...

I gotta go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him. Wanna help?

Having a weird pet.
[yells] Rat!

pixie dream girl trait.</i>

This is Rodolfo, he's a ferret.

I am probably best known for coining
the phrase manic pixie dream girl,

<i>and I coined that phrase in an article
that I wrote about a movie</i>

<i>called</i> Elizabethtown.

And in <i>Elizabethtown,</i>
there is an unusually pure example

<i>played by Kirsten Dunst.</i>

<i>And she is manic in the sense
that she talks and talk and talks.</i>

I'm so happy we're here
having this conversation

at 3:00 or whatever time it is.

It's such a great time.
Everyone's sleeping but us.

It's nice to have a conversation with you
and that you're really listening.

Then dream girl,
this idea that it's a male fantasy

that we can be depressed,
we can have nothing going,

<i>and this woman will find us</i>

<i>and she will set about
giving our life meaning.</i>

I'm not used to girls like you.

That's because I'm one of a kind.

She shows him how to have fun

and he offers her
absolutely nothing in return.

It's a very, very potent fantasy for men
that there's one woman out there,

one magical woman out there
that will save you.

Often around two thirds of the way
into a movie, the writer realizes

there's still a lot of story to tell
and not enough time.

But it's okay. Just like in Beverly Hills,

you can simply cut out any flab
you don't like using scissors.

Enter montage mode.

Well, when we first started talking
about montages,

it would be about Eisenstein,
and the <i>Battleship Potemkin,</i>

and just ways of cutting
together images from different angles...

[dramatic music playing]

<i>...that taught us that a movie
was not something</i>

<i>you shoot straight ahead like you would
if you were sitting at a play.</i>

<i>Battleship Potemkin</i>
really introduced audiences

to editing for the first time,
and what you can do with editing.


<i>and quickly grasping
the new cinematic language,</i>

<i>filmmakers began
montaging their brains out.</i>

forests, ocean liners...</i>

They're shorthand, really, montages.

Getting across quite a lot of story

<i>Of all the things

<i>Henchmen, stormtrooper,

You know, Hollywood gets a rap

Listen to me!

<i>One of Hollywood's earliest exploitations</i>

I have loved you the way they said.

<i>...was </i>The Children's Hour,
<i>an unsympathetic account</i>

<i>of two teachers,
Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine,</i>

<i>who are accused of a lesbian affair,</i>

<i>which leads to one of them
committing suicide.</i>

<i>But while Hollywood may try to highlight
the issues of LGBTQ characters,</i>

<i>it does kind of seem
to kill them in the process.</i>

At times when it's touching
on the actual misery

or torture of gay people,
I think it's actually okay as a clichÃ©.

<i>So for instance, in</i> Brokeback Mountain,

<i>it's not a love story,
it's about persecution</i>

over many, many years.

And so when that death finally occurs,

it's actually logically
dictated by the film.


Well, award season does really love
a biopic about a dead gay person.

<i>They love a film

Yeah, I can attest to that
because I played a gay character

And the character I played,
Jack Hock, did die of AIDS.

I'd like that on my tombstone.

So yes, that is obviously true.

Every hero needs a villain
to go up against.

It's taken us a while
to get around to him,

but he's been expecting you, Mr. Bond.

<i>If your hero is good-looking,</i>

<i>this means the clichÃ©d bad guy
has to be the polar opposite,</i>

<i>and the filmmakers usually
make it easy for us to spot who they are.</i>

Allow me to introduce myself.

I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

We make them other than us.
We make them ugly, disfigured.

Some scar to say that they're evil,
even if they're a lion.

Murderer.

You're telling a story,
you're telling the audience

that your character has been
involved in nefarious activity

<i>and probably physical violence
in the past.</i>

...and fulfill your destiny.

The disfigured villain goes way back.

<i>Back to silent film.
You have, obviously, Lon Chaney</i>

<i>in </i>Phantom of the Opera,

with the hairpins
stretching his nostrils out.

The problem with that sort of
characterization is the fact that then,

in real life, it translates to people

who have those physical disfigurements

being seen by other people
as dangerous, as scary,

as someone to shun.

Certainly that equating of disfigurement
in some way turning you into a psychopath

is incredibly insulting.

A lot of villains
are more cultured than the hero.

You know, you'll have villains
who talk about their love of Beethoven.

You don't like Beethoven.


You don't know what you're missing.

...gives a sense
that there is another side,

another side to them, which enhances
the fact that they're, you know, evil.

I ate his liver with some fava beans

They're often British.

That tends to be
a real subcategory of villains.

In Hollywood, they thought
that an English accent

was a shorthand for sophistication.

Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

If your baddie had an English accent,
then the hero was dealing with something

that wasn't just plain brutish.

There was something else behind it.

Somehow casting an English actor,
because we're cheap,

and you can say the dialogue,

and you can say gibberish dialogue
with great conviction.

History, tradition, culture,
are not concepts.

These are trophies
I keep in my den as paperweights!

The monologue is a clichÃ©
because it's the stuff of drama.

Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

It's the writer allowing the audience to
understand where this character comes from

and why they're doing what they're doing.

I had a villain's monologue
in the final sequence of <i>Logan.</i>

I'm giving this verse
about why I've done what I've done

and killed his family, all this.

I realized we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

We use those products
to perfect ourselves.

And halfway through my monologue...

he kills me, deservedly.

There comes a time when every movie
simply has to stop happening.

And that time is known as the end.

It's when all the narrative plates
you've been spinning

have to suddenly weave together
in a better metaphor than this.

It's time for
the movie's climactic endgame,

<i>and there are only
so many forms that can take.</i>

<i>The shower scene in Hitchcock's </i>Psycho

<i>with Janet Leigh is seen</i> by many
<i>to be the inspiration for our next clichÃ©.</i>

<i>And for locks on bathroom doors.</i>

Hitchcock popularized this notion
that it would be women going through

these horrific circumstances,
and he set up this expectation

<i>that women would play
a central role in thrillers.</i>

Janet Leigh's daughter,</i>

<i>Jamie Lee Curtis, played a role</i>

<i>which made her an icon of the clichÃ©
now known as the final girl.</i>

The monster versus the final girl,
Jamie Lee Curtis in <i>Halloween,</i>

symbolically stands as the first.

She is the blueprint, the prototype.

The final girl is the one girl
who doesn't have sex,

who's more innocent than her friends.

You must have a small fortune stashed
from babysitting so much.

Guys think I'm too smart.

Because she's not having sex,

she's somehow miraculously
more observant than all of her friends

and senses something wrong first.

If you want
a really good final-girl movie,

you need to take a group of friends...

If you listen to the old timers in town,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

They've all gone off
on a weekend party somewhere.

You need to give them
a spurious reason to go off

in different directions,
and get up to any kind of mischief.

[suspenseful music playing]

That's another clichÃ©, another rule:
If you do the dirty deed,

you're gonna die.

One by one they are dispatched.


There's always a lull in these movies

where everyone thinks
the killer might be dead.

Then it all comes crashing down
and she has to prove herself again.

But she survives and she becomes
the audience surrogate.

I think slasher films
and all their clichÃ©s

would be completely dead right now
if there hadn't existed <i>Scream.</i>

on its blood-splattered head</i>

<i>by dispatching assumed final girl
Drew Barrymore in its opening moments.</i>

I think the <i>Scream</i> franchise
really addressed the horror fans

and their knowledge of the clichÃ©s,
and sort of turned it on its head.

What's the point? They're all the same.

Some stupid killer
stalking some big-breasted girl

who's running up the stairs when
she should be going out the door.

It's insulting.

<i>Today, she's better prepared.</i>

Fuck your family.

and we're making people
scared of her towards the end.

Eat it, bitch!

She is sometimes more deadly
than the people

that she's actually
kind of fighting to survive.

And technically,
has a much bigger body count

than any of the would-be "killers"
in the movie.

I think it's kind of evolved
as a clichÃ© now

into almost
a kind of a comfort-food finale.

Fuck.

and there's a ticking clock.</i>

If the hero doesn't act,
large amounts of people die.

So inherently dramatic.

How much time left?
Twenty seconds!

your heart is in your mouth.

this clichÃ© always comes down to the wire.</i>

You think?

Cut the red or the blue,
the red or the blue?

[suspenseful music playing]

It's one of the great
non-action climaxes ever.

They look sexier now.

<i>Often it's someone trying to hack in
and stop the countdown.</i>

[automated voice]
<i>Cerberus has been deactivated.</i>

If it's your hero defusing the time bomb,
you know he or she is gonna do it.

The fun thing for us is going,

"How close to one

<i>And it goes to one so many times.</i>

of a romance is the lover's mad dash</i>

<i>where one of the pair has a frenzied race
against time and geography</i>

<i>to declare undying love to their partner.</i>

Often, that will involve
a last-minute lover's dash to the airport,

<i>or to stop a wedding happening.</i>

The Graduate's<i> a classic one of that.</i>

Oh, Jesus, God, no.

their other half of their eternal love,</i>

<i>their reward is a passionate kiss,
usually in bad weather conditions.</i>

in kissing the person you love</i>

that you're not even aware
of the terrible weather.

And I think that's what happened
in <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral,</i>

was these two people
having all these obstacles

not to be together,
and finally, in the rain...

Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.

Greta Gerwig, the director,
did that for the end of <i>Little Women.</i>

She wanted that end-of-the-movie shot,
and I remember chatting to her about this

and she was like, "I want it, I want it,
I grew up watching it, and I want it."

If things have gone right, at the end,
the audience is on the edge of their seat

wondering whether the good guy will win,

<i>while knowing, with every
fiber in their being, that he will.</i>

Hey, why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

The morality tale
demands that the hero kills the villain.

<i>The better the death,</i>

the more satisfying
the vanquishing of the villain is.

Someone falling from a great height
has been a classic way

to finish your story.

<i>Brilliantly done in </i>Die Hard,<i> of course,</i>

and it gives them a moment or two
to know that they're beaten.

It's a very satisfying moment
for the audience.

<i>It's to enable them to feel safe.
You vanquish the villain so you feel safe.</i>


the behavior of the villain,</i>

the more karmic justice
we are praying for.

There's a blood lust that a great villain
creates in an audience.

Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

At the end of a movie, we want
to have good overcome bad.

That's what drives that desire
to watch a movie with great heroes.

That everything's gonna be okay
and the world's not scary.

binding sequel brings them back,</i>

<i>the last few moments of the movie
are for the heroes to bask</i>

<i>in their hard-earned glory
before riding off into the distance.</i>

Well, as I said at the start,
I've been Rob Lowe,

and that's it
for our look at Hollywood clichÃ©s.

Nothing for me to do now except
jump on my horse and/or motorcycle

and ride off into the sunset
while rock music and/or hip-hop kicks in.

But that would ruin my suit.

So let's just abruptly roll credits
when I snap my fingers.
