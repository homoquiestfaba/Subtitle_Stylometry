There are other people involved!

Teenaged Journey, narrating:
<i>Mama named me Journey.</i>

<i>Journey...</i>

<i>As if somehow she wished
her restlessness on me.</i>

<i>But it was mama who
would be gone when I was 11,</i>

<i>before spring
crashed onto our hillside</i>

<i>with explosions
from mount Laurel,</i>

<i>before summer came,</i>

<i>with the soft slap
of the screen door,</i>

<i>breathless nights and mildew</i>

<i>on the books.</i>

You shouldn't do this.
It's wrong.

I can't live here anymore.

You're always telling me
what I do wrong.

It's your house, too.
Your children.

They have you.

I'm not enough, Min.

Oh, yes, you are.

You fill up this house, Marcus.

It's your house, your land,

your grandchildren, your rules.

And my fault,
like it's always been.

Someone else's fault.

I can't be
what you want, Marcus.

I never could.

Even when I was little,

you remember when I wanted
to ride the tractor with you?

You said I shouldn't.

When I wanted to work in town,

you said I shouldn't.

When I wanted
to go away to school,

you made me stay here.

Oh, that was a long time ago.

Yeah. You gave up on me
a long time ago.

Is it my fault he left you, too?

I don't think so.

Nobody leaves this place.

Family's lived here forever.

Our family doesn't go away.

I go away.

It isn't fair
to Journey and Cat.

You come and go like a visitor.

That's not a mother's way.

Don't come back.

When I was little,

I used to stare
at daddy's picture,

try to remember him.

Tried to place the picture

so his eyes
would look into mine.

They never did.

They always looked past me.

Do you remember him?

Do you know why daddy ran away?

No one talks about it.

I don't even think about him.

She's leaving.

Again?

She's got a suitcase.

No. No!

I'll send money
for Cat and Journey.

They're better off here.

It's not good enough, Min.

I'll call.

Mom.

I'll come back, Journey.

No, son, she won't be back.

Mama?

She won't be back.

Oof!

Oh!

Oh, no.

Lottie?

Lott...

Ohh...

That's all we have
of Min and the children.

Oh, Lottie.

Cat?

Cat?

Where you going?

I'm rearranging my life.

I don't want my camera,
mama's recorder,

and most everything
else. Including meat.

I spent yesterday
looking into a cow's eyes,

and I will be a vegetarian.

Which cow?

Tired of this, Cat?

My pictures are so...

Boring?

You're right, grandpa.

You take it.

Journey?

I know the farm.

Why would I need to
take pictures of it?

Oh.

Oh, look.
A recorder.

I used to play the recorder.

A long time ago, remember?

Oh, look.

That's mama's shirt.

Journey...

Come here.

Come here, come here.

Cat, come here.

It's o.K.

Lottie?

Turn around.

Good morning, Journey.

Looking for your grandfather?

No.

Where is he?

Taking pictures of cow pies.

Sorry about your mama, Journey.

She'll be back.

Oh, Marcus!

I'm getting
really tired of that.

Hi, Cat.

Thank you.

No return address.

I expect she won't...

Marcus...

Let it be.

I think...

That what grandpa means...

Is that there'll be
money in the envelope,

not words,

not the words you want.

You'll be disappointed.

I'm not disappointed!
I'm not!

There are words.

Our names are there.
Our names are words.

Journey, you keep the money.

Do what you want with it.

I'll put it in the bank.

I'll start a child account.

When mama tells where she is,
we could visit.

She forgot the return address.

She forgot. That's all.

Oh, Journey.

Why do you do that?

Why?

'Cause he needs to.

I don't understand.

I know, honey, I know.

Journey?

Come here.

Let's look at these.

There's your great-uncle Tom.

Oh, and your cousin Bob.

Remember him?

Ahh.

And that's me...

When I was Cat's age.

And that's me again.

Now, that was taken
on a long-ago 4th of July.

You look happy.

I was happy.

That was the day
I met your grandpa.

Aw, and there's your mother...

Same age, same date,
many years later.

Hey, that's aunt Lacy
and uncle Maynard.

That's right.

Your grandpa took that picture.

It's a good picture.

Except for mama.

Journey.

Now, your mama always
wanted to be somewhere else.

Well, now she is...

Somewhere else.

Wait!

Mama!

Wait, mama!

Wait!

Mama, wait! Mama!

Do you ever come through
the door like everyone else?

No.

Here we go, Emmet.

Good boy.

Emmet, hi.

Hey, guys.

How are you?

Will you marry me?

That's the first time
this month he's asked.

He'll get tired of it.

Routine is good.

My mother says so.

So?

She's gone.

He looks like you, Cooper.

Oh, yeah.

That's what everybody says.

We all look alike,
the whole family down through the ages.

Toss our pictures in the air.

When they came down,
they'd all look like me.

Well, I don't look like anyone.

Is that you, Cat?

No.

That's mama,
mama a long time ago.

Oh, it's just that...

We look so much
the same, I know.

Yeah.

There. That's
who I look like.

Look. See?

Yeah, I do.

I do.

Sounds like a wedding.

But you look like mama, too.

Well, well, look
who's come for a visit.

Hello, Cooper.

Hey.

Would you hold that, Journey?

Oh, Emmet. Well,
nice to see you again.

How's my boy?

Ha ha ha!

Yeah. Come on.

Yeah.

How are you?

Sorry.

I didn't mean to do that.

No, no.
That's all right.

You can take as many
pictures as you want.

Trot, trot to Boston,

trot, trot to Lynn,

watch out, little boy,

or you'll fall in.

Trot, trot to Boston,

trot, trot to Lynn,

watch out, little boy,

or you'll fall in.

Trot, trot to Boston,

trot, trot to Lynn,

watch out, little boy,

or you'll fall in.

Teenaged Journey, narrating:
<i>We're in the garden, up and down I go,</i>

<i>my eyes fastened on white
buttons against a blue shirt.</i>

<i>The smell of summer
fills the air,</i>

<i>and voices rising and falling</i>

<i>and laughter.</i>

<i>Watch out, little boy.</i>

<i>Or you'll...</i>

<i>I look at the shirt button
and then the neck,</i>

<i>but there's no face.</i>

<i>It's my father, I know,
but there's no face.</i>

Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

Oh, yeah.

Ha ha ha.

Yeah. There you go,
big fella.

Ah.

Things don't look the
same through the camera,

not the way they
are in real life.

Sometimes, and sometimes
pictures show us

what is really there.

How can that be?

I don't know, Journey.

Maybe that's why
people take pictures...

To see what's there.

What do you mean,
"to see what is there"?

Look.

What does he mean?

That could be you, Journey.

Is that daddy?
It's him, isn't it?

Two of a kind.

It's grandfather, Journey.

Grandfather.

And you look like him.

You are like him.

No.

Cat, I need some milk.

Coming!

I'll come with you.

Come on, Emmet.

Let's go see
Journey's grandmother.

No.

You've got to try.

I can't.

You've got to.

Stop arguing.

We're not arguing.
We're having a dialogue.

It sounds like arguing.

I don't know
how to drive to town.

You'll learn.

I don't want to learn.

You'll be glad someday

to know how to drive!

Why?

I'm an old man.

If I die behind the wheel,

you'll be able to drive.

I'm only a boy.

So drive like a boy.

Just a minute.
Come on over here.

Stand there.

Not another family picture.

Yes. Lottie!

Lottie!

A picture, Lottie.
Get a hat.

It's hot. Why
are we doing this?

I'm not an actor, Marcus.

I'm a hot, old woman.

You're a fetching
hot, old woman.

Timer's set.

10, 9, 8...

7...
Why?

6...

5...

4...

3...

Don't look up.

2, 1.

Oh, no.

Never mind.

Let's get going.

I've got rolls
of film to drop off,

pictures to pick up.

And, uh, other things
to get in town.

Other things?
What other things?

Things. Photo things.

Come on, Journey.

I'll drive
when we get into town.

You drive now.

I can't reach the pedals.

I can't even see out.

Here. Sit on this pillow.

Wait. This is
the brake.

No. The clutch.
The clutch!

You said...
I know. I know.

Ha ha ha.

I remember when he
taught Min how to drive.

Oh, that was some yelling.

Lots of yelling.

Min never did take to anyone

telling her what to do,
especially Marcus.

Especially Marcus.

It's funny how some people

bump up against each other.

Yeah, but they did all the time,

even when Min was little.

Marcus has his way.

She never liked his way.

Well, he never liked
her way, either, Lottie.

Ha ha! That's true.

Maybe she'll come back.

Maybe not.

Maybe it's better
if she stays away.

Hello?

Hello?

Min?

Here.

You sure you wanna stay?

You're a good worker.

Gotta move on.

Maybe you'll come
through here again.

Thank you.

That's it.
He's doing all right.

I can't do this.

Why do you have a car like this?

I love this car.

There aren't many left.

They're extinct, like
the passenger pigeon.

That's what grandma says.

Oh, does she?

Well. Ha ha!

Hold it steady now.

Come on.
Hold it steady.

If we crash,
he'll photograph it as it happens.

Hold it there now.
That's right.

Good.

Hey!

Millie!

Hey!

Hey!

Oh!

Oh.

Hey, jed's back!

Hi!

Hey, Marcus!

Hey, grandpa, look.

Quick! Take a picture.

Oh. Oh!

Cooper! Hey!

Ahh.

You know?

Huh?

I bet that picture of all of us

looking at the airplane,
it'll be fine.

I think so, too, Journey.

Two of a kind.

Come on!
It's coming down harder!

Hurry up. Let's go.

Hurry up, you guys.

I am hurrying.

We can't get 'em all.

Don't we have enough?

Come on, Cat.
Come on, Journey.

Come on, boy.
Let's get inside.

It's wet.

Oh, let's get in there.

Hurry up.

Journey, move faster, go, quick.

Whoa!

Oh, let's get inside.

Here we are.

Saved from the rain.

Well done.

Oh, smell those.

Oh, that's a wonderful smell,
isn't it?

Oh, yeah.

Well, there are ants everywhere.

There are, yeah.

Well, just regard them

like they're sightseers

or like they're visitors.

Marcus...

It's new.

I bought it in town.

Ha ha.

Marcus,
I have spots in front of my eyes.

I can't see.

Go away and be a farmer,
will you?

I'm a farmer who
takes pictures, Lottie.

I'm a photographer farmer.

Ha ha ha.

Marcus, you've got to learn

you cannot always have
things your own way.

Maybe the chickens.

You moved the camera.

That's why the edges are fuzzy.

It's not a good picture,
I guess.

Journey, it's
a wonderful picture.

But I moved the camera.

You did, but you
see how Emmet and I

look like we're
the only ones there,

how we look like we're
wrapped in a cocoon,

away from the rest of the world?

See how the edge is framed?

Yeah, but it's not perfect.

Perfect?

What's perfect?

Journey...

Things don't have to be
perfect to make them fine.

Now, that goes for pictures,

and that goes for life.

Things could be good enough.

Grandfather...

Hmm?

Do you think mama left

because I wasn't good enough?

No.

No, Journey.

You know that
I tell you the truth,

even when you
don't like to hear it.

Sometimes you tell me the truth.

You say that mama
won't come back,

and I know she will.

That wasn't the truth.

You need someone to blame,
Journey, is that it?

Well, here's an important truth.

It is not your fault.

It's not all mama's fault.

No. I can see that
you can't blame Min,

and that's all right.

I remember things.

I remember
"trot, trot to Boston."

I do.

Oh, I'm not surprised
that you remember.

You were very little,

but you wanted to hear
that rhyme over and over.

I remember I sat on daddy's
lap before he went away.

I remember his buttons,

that he held my hands
and wouldn't let me fall.

Mama and papa kept me safe

and cared for me until you...

Until I made them go away?

You think I did that?

Where are the pictures?
I want to see them.

What pictures?

Of papa, mama, me, and Cat

when we were babies, like Emmet,

when I was on papa's knees
and he sang to me.

There weren't many.

I don't need many.

They're gone.

Gone? You mean
mama took them?

The truth?

Yes.

Did she take them?

No, Journey.

Your mama tore them up.

Marcus?

He blames me.

Oh, he blames you.
You blame her.

All this blame.

How could she
leave the children?

How could she do that?

I don't know.

Do you remember when
min used to sit on my lap...

When she was little?

She'd stay for a while,

and then she wandered.

Remember we'd find her
way down the road,

way out in the Meadow,

as if she was going away?

As if she was going away then.

Oh, I don't know, Marcus.

I... I don't know.

I loved her when she was little.

Yeah.

You're trying
not to love her now,

just like Journey's
trying not to love you.

I don't believe
you're sick, Journey.

If you are,

you like us to bring you
ginger ale and soup.

I have a sore throat.

Yeah, let's see.

I have a temperature, too.

How many quilts
do you have here?

1, 2, 3... a quilt, bedspread.

You've got five blankets.
It's summer.

You may turn into a butterfly.

Cat...

Mama tore up our pictures.

I know.

Cat!

You're not sick, Journey!

You're hiding out.

You always hide out
when things go wrong.

Here! Listen
to the music.

Hi.

Hi.

You feeling better?

Cat made me get up.

Cat's a woman of action.

She don't believe much
in introspection.

Introspection?

That's what you've been doing

for the past two days,

thinking mostly about yourself.

You see, Cat...

She believes
that if she keeps busy,

all of her problems
will just go away.

Does that work?

No more than thinking works.

But if you notice,
my garden is... what?

Twice the size it was last year.

We all do the best we can.

Your sister and I,

we garden ourselves
into a kind of madness.

You think yourself
into a sore throat.

And your grandpa takes pictures.

Ha ha ha!

He's going to take
a picture of us now,

that old buzzard.

How do you know?
He didn't look here.

Oh, yes, he did.

I saw his eyes roll to the side.

Why are we whispering?

I don't know,

but I know I'm the smartest
woman on this porch.

When he takes the picture,
we'll cover our face.

1, 2, 3...

Ha ha ha!

He is such a noodle, isn't he?

Grandma...

Why did mama do it,
tear up the pictures?

Journey, I've told you before.

I can't speak for Min.

I'll have to ask her
when I see her.

Come here.

Oh, I hope you get to do that.

I really do.

Grandfather shouldn't
have told me.

He shouldn't have told me

that mama tore up the pictures.

Journey, you asked.

It's funny sometimes how we
just get angry at the wrong person,

you know?

I could have a sore throat.
I could have a temperature.

Do you hear me?

There you go.

Up we go.

Oop! No more.

Scoop the new... ah, get away!

Emmet.

Here we go, Emmet.

Applesauce.
It's your favorite.

Here we go.
Open up.

Here it comes.

All right.

Good boy.

There we are.
Look. That's you, Millie.

Oh, Marcus, you rogue,

leaning out
a speeding automobile,

catching me with curlers!

I saw you driving, Journey!

He made me.

Now, here is one
nobody should own.

Oh.

Who took this picture?

You, Marcus?

It was that hot spell, Boone.

I also have a nice close-up
of your underwear.

In a heap by the pond.

Marcus, you're
a menace, you are.

I've got pictures I'd
rather do away with.

When I was young and gawky.

Aw, when I first
met Mrs. Macdougal,

she had her hair all
swept up to one side.

Lot of lipstick and her
cheeks like little apples.

I wanted to look older.

Didn't we want that?

Yeah.

Journey, would you get the pies

from the kitchen table?

Sure.

I have pictures of when
I dyed my hair yellow.

She looked like a sunflower.

Journey, what is it?

Shh!

It's a Cat.

I've never seen that Cat before.

Beautiful.

Who do you think he belongs to?

No one.

He belongs to no one.

He belongs to someone.

Everything belongs to someone.

Hey, guy, come here.

Have you seen Journey?

No, I haven't seen him.

Journey, what is it?

A Cat.

A Cat?

Well, that Cat

better not get any of my birds.

That's the only bad thing
about grandma.

She hates cats.

Cooper!

Cooper!

Look.

Careful.

Oh, Cat, get the phone,
will you?

Hello.

No.

No, I will not
let you speak to him!

It was no one.

Thanks again, Lottie!
See, y'all!

See ya! Bye, Cat!

Can I do something for you?

No.

Thanks, grandma.
Good night.

Good night.

Good night.

What is it, Journey?

Look.

Oh, look at that.

Well.

Aw, all tuckered out, eh?

Whose Cat is it?

No, Journey.

You know your grandma's
not fond of cats.

She loves her birds.

Well, I love this Cat.

He came to my window.

I think he's mine.

Do not...

Do not name this Cat.

You know the family rules.

If you name it,

you have to take care of it.

If I name it, he's mine.

Oh!

Look.

There's a little blood here. Look,
huh?

Oh, see?

A cut on his foot.

Aw, you're really something.

Yes, you are really
a good pussycat.

What's going on in...

Marcus, for heaven's sakes!

Oh!

Have you named him yet?

Marcus.

Lottie, this is
an injured animal.

We have to be humane here.

Marcus, you know how
I feel about cats.

And cats are not
humane to birds.

Grandma?

I need this Cat.

Actually, Lottie,

it's unfortunate, I know,

but Journey has
named the Cat already.

You know the rules.

Oh, yeah? What's the name?
What have you named him?

Uh, yes...

His name is, uh...

His name is bloom.

Isn't that what you call him,
Journey?

Yes. Bloom.

You just made that up, old man.

You might as well
have called him peony.

Lottie, Journey knows that peony

is no name for a Cat.

Hi.

Mom forgot her sweater and...

Hey, what did you name him?

Bloom.

I'll get the camera!

Such a pretty kitty.

So soft.

Yes, you are.

Hmm.

Grandfather?

Thank you.

You're welcome.

So...

How's Lottie taking all this?

Fair to middling.

More fair than middling.

He's a good Cat bird.

He catches mice, not birds.

Mmm.

Oh, boy.

And does Lottie know
that he is a she?

From the looks of it,

about to have a litter.

Not yet.

Well, she will soon.

Congratulations.

You're going to be a papa.

Did you really think

that I didn't know
bloom was female?

You knew?

Grandma knows everything.

Of course I knew.

This means there's going to be

half a dozen
furry little animals

that are going to grow up to be

large, hungry, furry animals

that are going to eat my birds!

Oh, psst! Psst!

She likes you, Lottie.

Oh,
get out of here. There's work to be done.

What about dessert?

The pie is cooling.
Now, go on.

Oh, not another mouse!

You are a filthy cannibal.

She's angry.

Just get out of here, will you?

Do you want a little treat?

You are a beautiful Cat.

Oh, you are beautiful.

You are the best Cat
in the world.

You like that?

Hi.

Be good.

Still no return address.

It's like she left
this postmark path

he can't follow.

She did it to you, too, Cat.

Better run.

Grandfather wants to take
another family picture.

Everybody!

Come on, hurry!

Come on!

Come on, just one picture!

One family picture!

Come on!

Bloom.

Bloom.

I think we're safe.

Trying to hide from me, are you?

Now, I've caught you.
I've caught you.

Come on now.
Come on now.

Yes, just one picture.

She didn't take them with her.

She left them here.

She sure destroyed
our family, didn't she?

It looks like murder.

I'm going to fix this, Cat.

I'm going to tape these
pictures back together.

Journey...

It's all right, Lottie.

He has a right
to those pictures.

They're Journey's past.

I'm going to put all these
pictures back together,

and everything will be fine.

It will.

Journey, it's too hard.

It's impossible.

There's hundreds
of pictures here.

Hundreds.

Your cowboy hat looks stupid.

Cat,
she tore the pictures up so small,

can't fix them.

Mom is not coming back.

Is she?

The box is all yours, bloom.

You found it, after all.

Hey, thanks
for bringing my bike.

Sorry...

About what I said to you

about your hat.

You been crying?

Yeah.

Well, then, let's go in.

Mrs. Macdougal's
making breakfast.

Why do you call your mom
Mrs. Macdougal?

Well, that's her name.

Come on.

He's learning to feed himself.

Mr. Macdougal!

I've eaten,
Mrs. Macdougal.

I'll have coffee.

Oh, here.

Ooh, pancakes.

Good morning.

Good morning,
Mr. Macdougal.

Come on. Let's
have some breakfast.

Good morning.

Look at this little boy.

Good morning, young man.

Good morning, Journey.
How you doing, son?

Isn't that a face he made?

You eating?

Yeah.
He needs a plate.

Woo woo woo!

Oh, you don't have any pancakes.

There.
Eggs?

Yes, yes, give him eggs.

Is your coffee cold?

No, it's all right.

Syrup.

Here.

You?

Plump as a plum, wasn't he?

Grandfather says pictures
show the truth sometimes.

There's truth in this one,
I'd say.

Look at
my smile. Ha ha.

I'd captured her.

And you see how
happy she is I did?

Sometimes there's truth,
duncan's right,

but do you see that
picture of me there?

Don't we look like
the perfect family?

My brother Fergus
there on the left

was pinching the devil out of me

when that picture was taken.

He did that all my life.

He still does.

Sometimes the truth is
somewhere behind the pictures,

not in them.

Well, I'd better
go hose him off.

It's early, Journey.

Do Marcus and Lottie
know where you are?

You want a ride?

I'm going to ride him home
on my bike, Mr. Macdougal

all right, then.
I'm off.

Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

Wheezer, come on!

Come on, come on.

Ok, wheezer, go home.

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Get out of here, wheezer.

Whoo-hoo!

Whoo-hoo!

Yes.

You are a wonderful mother.

Who taught her?

Taught her what?
How to have kittens?

No, how to be a mother.

Mothers know.

Well, not all of them.

Grandfather.

Hmm?

I want to take a
picture with the timer.

Oh, no.

In the hall, Journey.

Oh, no.

Now we have two of them.

Everybody get closer.

All right.
Get around there.

You sound like you-know-who.

Who?

The photographer twins.

There.

We're starting.

10...

9...

Quick! Camera.

We could keep them in my room.

Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we could.

It's good to eat with people

who don't have food on
their faces. But I love Emmet.

You certainly do.

You're a good brother,
Cooper. Thank you.

Where's she going?

She's going out.
Don't worry.

She'll be back.

She'll come back, Journey.

She'll be back.

Well, thanks.
I'd better get going.

Bye. Thanks again.

Bye, Cooper.

Bye.

Maybe someday I will marry him.

Hey, come and do some gardening with me,
yeah?

I think I'll take a
walk to the henhouse.

Oh, I'll get it, grandfather.

Hello.

Journey?

Journey, is that you?

Journey, it's mama.

Journey?

Yes.

How... how are you?

Mama, a Cat has come...

And the Cat's
a very good mother.

She's staying with me...

Forever.

That's a new one.

Some chicken pecked me.

This taking pictures
is dangerous business.

Mama called.

She asked me how I was.

She never said
she was sorry for leaving.

No...

Min doesn't want to feel guilty.

Then mama said...

"They were only pictures,
Journey."

Your mama...

Doesn't really understand
about the pictures.

Mama wants me to visit her.

I told her I couldn't.

I told her I had a Cat
and kittens to take care of.

I told her someday, maybe,

if she sent me words
instead of money,

I might visit her...

Maybe.

Grandfather?

What, Journey?

I told her nothing is perfect.

Sometimes,
things are good enough.

I like that picture.

Hmm?

Oh, so do I.

Hey, is that the chicken
that pecked you?

Ha.

Maybe. Ha.

Well...

He needs things to look back on.

Shame about the old pictures.

Guess there's no way
to get them back.

Where has he been?

Do you know, Journey?

No.

This is his third trip
to town this week.

Do not follow me.

Ha ha. What's he doing?

Well, let's find out.

Marcus...
My darling man,

what are you doing?

Don't sweet-talk me, Lottie!

Well, we could spy on him.

Better sooner than ask him.

I think it's more fun to keep him waiting,
don't you?

Shh.
Yeah.

It's locked.
Knock.

Grandfather?

I'm busy, busy in my office.

Well, leave him.
Come on. Come on.

Every third or every fourth?

Every other.

Third.

Remember when we used
to make tents in the backyard?

You liked to build the tents,

and when you were done,

you'd sit inside all jittery,

waiting for something more
to happen.

What?

Something grandfather said...

Mama waiting
for things to happen.

Remember when mama
got in the tent with us once?

Yeah.

She sat for a minute,

and then she looked at us
and said, "well, what now?"

You and I, we weren't enough.

Cat...

Sorry I couldn't put the
pictures back together.

I tried to make
everything all right again.

I know.

You and grandfather...
two of a kind.

What do you mean?

Why do you think grandfather
takes family pictures?

Because he likes to,
he likes the camera.

Don't you know that grandfather
wants to give you back

everything that mama
took away... Family.

Cat...

Do you... do you hate mama?

I hate what she did.

You say that,
but do you really feel that way?

I'm trying.

Do you think she cares about us?

In her way, I guess.

What? What's wrong?

Wish I had grandpa's
camera right now.

You're red.

Journey!

I'm going to get you!

I'm going to kill you!
Come back here!

You're dead.

Stop running!
Come here!

You can run, but you can't hide!

Aah!

Can't catch me!

You got it all over me!

Can't run forever.

I'm going to get you!

Stop!

You're a noodle, Journey!
A noodle!

Journey, come back here!

Where are you going?

Journey, where are you going?

Hello, mother.

Hello, Min.

I've not come back.

I didn't think you had.

I...

I can't live here.
I just can't.

I'm sorry.

I'll write you.

And the children?

They seem happy.

Min.

Min, I've learned
to play your recorder.

Are you all right?

Yeah.

I...

I have to go.

Good night, Journey.

Were you in mama's bedroom?

Yeah.
Kitty went in there.

Are you going to bed?

No, I'm not going to bed yet.

No, I've got work to do.
Good night.

Where are your shoes?

What is all this?

Don't talk for a minute.

5... 4...

3... 2...

1... yeah.

This is an enlarger.

The red light is for developing.

A darkroom?

You did all this?

They're black and white
pictures.

They're pictures from the past.

Now, this is a fine picture.

Not perfect.

But good enough.

Ha ha.

And there's more.

Mama's pictures.

There's a baby.

This one.

That baby...

Is you.

That's not the face I remember.

And now...

The other picture.

I know.

I already know.

It was your lap I sat on.

You sang "trot, trot to Boston,"

not papa.

It was your shirt,

your button I remember,

your face.

It was you who took care of me,

not papa.

It was you.

And this is when you knew.

Teenaged Journey, narrating:
<i>That summer night,</i>

<i>grandfather and I walked
out through the barn.</i>

<i>I trailed my fingers
along the wood walls.</i>

<i>I touched the hay,</i>

<i>as if touching it
somehow made it mine.</i>

<i>Once they loved me.</i>

<i>Teenaged when we opened the door</i>

<i>and walked out of the barn,</i>

<i>the night had gone,</i>

<i>and the sun had come up.</i>
