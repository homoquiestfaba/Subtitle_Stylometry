All units, report!

Report! Somebody answer the damn radio!

<i>MAN: Sir, it's inside!</i>

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Initiate scenario D.

Central Command, confirm!
Initiate scenario D. Confirm!


Tell me you'll remember
everything I've told you, Frank.

I'll remember, Mom.

(FRANK GRUNTS)

Sit still. Don't be such a baby.
Do you act this way at the doctor's office?

(FRANK WHIMPERING)

They've tapped our phones.
Your father's working for them.

Don't you understand?
Mom, you're hurting me. Please, stop it.

Look at your hands.
Let it burn into your memory, Frank.

Look at them. Tell me you'll never forget.

I won't.

For the rest of your life. Promise me!
I promise.

Say it back to me. What did I tell you?
Sublevel 3, Vault 12.

That's a good little man.

Eyes shut. Bedtime.

Mommy, no!

That's the way you want it? Come on.
Let's see it.

Daddy! Daddy!
Son, get to bed!

(GUN SHOT)

Crazy bitch! Give me that!



FRANK: Excuse me. Sir, excuse me.

Do you know where Fort Lambert is? Sir!

He can't hear you. He's hearing impaired.

Do you know where Fort Lambert is?

Fort Lambert, the Army base?

She knows.
Can she point the way?

Kazzy. Inside, now.

Sir, do you know where Fort Lambert is?

Can I help you, sir?
Yeah...

Can I see your base commander?
Do you have an appointment?

I tried.

You know the Army.
I mean, it's like you need a chain saw

to cut through the red tape.

But your...
Your CO is Colonel Turner, right?

Look, I know this sounds kind of crazy,
but could you tell him that I'm here, that...

That Frank Sears is here to see him?
I'll only take five minutes of his time.

I drove... I drove 36 hours
straight from New Jersey to get here today.

Sir, if you have no authorized business,

I'm gonna ask you to turn around
and be on your way.

Sir, you have 10 seconds to move out,
or we do the moving for you.

Get a life, douchebag.

ZAREMBA: Do you ever feel guilty?

(BOTH PANTING)

Here we are, sweeping up trash,
while the guys overseas are getting shot at.

Well, I would be happy to sign you up
for a combat rotation, Zaremba.

You like falafel, right?
Sure.

If you worked your back
as much as your mouth,

this job would have been done last week.

Me?

Check out that room.


CARRIE: Radiation below threshold,
zero bio.

Toxicity clear.
Pull everything from these three rooms.

I'll take these items to TTL.

<i>MAN 1 ON RADIO: We fought for decades</i>
<i>to keep Fort Lambert open</i>

<i>as a working Army installation.</i>
<i>This time, we didn't make the cut.</i>

Look at your hands.
Let it burn into your memory, Frank.

Look at them. Tell me you'll never forget.

<i>... have announced their intentions</i>
<i>to build a gambling casino on the site.</i>

<i>MAN 1 ON RADIO: Does the country not yet</i>
<i>have enough places for hardworking people</i>

<i>to fritter away their life savings</i>
<i>while drinking themselves into oblivion?</i>

<i>MAN 2 ON RADIO: The siting of</i>
<i>a world-class casino operation</i>

<i>in a rural area such as Bennell</i>

<i>has lifted the economic boats</i>
<i>of all citizens of the region.</i>

Glenn, I'm on my way down.

Glenn!

We are scheduled to complete
Abatement Phase 3 today,

and now you're telling me
you want another 36 hours.

Erik...

Sir.

My task is to certify the property
free of hazardous substances.

There's 50 years of accumulation
and incomplete record-keeping.

I can't predict what we're gonna find,
or how long it's gonna take.

Well, so far, you've turned up
a quart of moonshine whiskey

and three chemicals
found in any transmission shop.

That's no predictor
of what else might be here.

This property reverts to the Cochiti tribe
once we've finished.

Does the Army want some Indian kid
to dig up a contaminated vial and get sick?

Demolition's scheduled to commence
Friday at 0701 hours.

Do what you can to wrap out by 0700.
Put your crews on double shifts.

If you need support,
I'll give you every soldier I can spare.

If it's humanly possible,
we'll get it done, sir.

Specialist.
Colonel.

You're overdue for a haircut, soldier.
On my next day off, sir.

Washington gives him hard deadlines,

but they won't spend the money
to do the job right.

We need two more crews.
Can we finish by Friday?

If we don't sleep.
CARRIE: We'll push as hard as we can

without lowering our standards.

Agreed?
Agreed.

How's that new pad working?
Fine.

We should check it.

I'm fine.

After you.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: We do not need</i>
<i>a gambling casino here.</i>

<i>We're not fooled by these economic carrots</i>
<i>being dangled in front of our noses.</i>

<i>There is an ill wind blowing into this town.</i>
<i>We must hold firm to the ground,</i>

<i>and not let ourselves be swept up</i>
<i>in its filthy clutches.</i>

Sir! Ma'am!
As you were.

Sorry, Private.
No problem, ma'am.

SOLDIER: All right, ma'am,
I'll watch the door.


Ready?

(CARRIE GASPS)


Nice ass, huh?

Oh. You've gotta keep the weight
off this, baby.

These long days working at the computer...
The worst thing you could possibly do.

Honey, just change the dressing.
Three more days, we're on leave.

A little beach, a little food, a little sun...


I have this funny feeling
my tongue's gonna get a hell of a workout.

Yeah?

But I guarantee you my lazy ass
gets straight R&R.

SOLDIER: Shoot the tires out!

Sir, we've arrived with the subject
at room 23C.

Sounds like I got that appointment.

ARBOGAST: You say your mother
was in the Army?

She worked on this base in 1958.

What dates in 1958?
You tell me.

I tried Army archives, but they said
that my mother's records were lost in a fire.

But I know it was before March 13, 1959,
'cause that was when I was born.

And I was born in Philadelphia.

Did she mention the name of the program?

No.


My mother

was disturbed. So...

Maybe none of this is true.

So just tell me that I'm wrong,
and that I have nothing to worry about.

And I'll apologize, and I'll...

I'll go back to teaching my high school
biology class in Trenton, New Jersey.

And why are you coming to us now?

I've been trying to forget
what my mother said my entire life.

But I was up one night...

I was Googling on the Web, and I saw
that they were tearing down Fort Lambert.

And I tried to call.

But I couldn't get anywhere.

So I got in my car, and I...

I just drove straight here.

As you were.

With your permission...

ARBOGAST: I think we're finished here.
Hold on a second.

Sir?

Proceed, Freeborn.

Tell us exactly what your mother said.
The best as you can remember her words.

She came into my room at bedtime.

It was two weeks before my 10th birthday.
It was a Sunday night, February 27, 1969.

She told me that she worked
at Fort Lambert.

She told me that there was something
locked away underneath the base.

Something bad.

And that it was up to me
to make sure that it never got disturbed.

She said it was in Sublevel 3, Vault 12.

And then she killed my father.

Mommy, no!

Frank Chalmers Sears, go to your room!

Mr. Sears, are you sure of the words
your mother used to describe the location?

Sublevel 3, Vault 12?

There's nothing in my life
that I'm more sure of.

MAITLAND: What'd you get
from Washington?

ARBOGAST: They ran three
separate searches,

with three different spellings
of the name Sears... It's nothing.

MAITLAND: Mr. and Mrs. Freeborn...

Your report says Sublevel 3 was cleared
10 days ago.

Vault 12 was empty.

We wanna have another look.
Washington has no record

of an Eleanore Sears
in the employ of the US Military.

I've checked every branch.

Fortunately, that means nothing.

Tell me what you're not telling me.

Carrie and I found gaps
in the documentation of the activities

on this base during the summer of 1958.

High electricity consumption,
material deliveries

when official records
show no programs in operation.

And how does that impact
the accomplishment of our mission?

Here. Today.
Potentially in every way.

We suspect a secret program
was staged here in 1958.

There's no hard evidence yet,

but the residue of such a program
might still exist.

We can't ignore
what Frank Sears is telling us.

The 1950s was the black hole
of secret Cold War programs.

After Hiroshima, our military believed

future wars would be won
in a laboratory, not on a battlefield.

Unknown billions were spent,

secret laboratories set up
all over the country,

the best scientific minds enlisted to create
the warfare techniques of the future.

Discoveries were utilized
or written off as failures,

or deemed so hideous
they were shut down.

The very knowledge of their existence
buried in a labyrinth of

classified paperwork,
decades of blackout blocks of redacted text

and documents that always seemed
to end up lost or destroyed.

Before we did this work,
we thought the Army must know,

at some level, everything it's ever done.

We've since found out that's just not true.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

No measurable radiation, no bios,
zero toxicity, pH normal.

Well, whatever must have been in here
is gone.

We should check it out, Carrie.

Go to the back wall. Tap on it.

(HOLLOW THUD)

Keep moving along the wall.

(DULL THUD)

Son of a bitch!

What's going on? What's going on?

Don't disturb it! Please!
Don't disturb it! Don't!

Get this thing covered.
SOLDIER: Yes, sir!

Please, don't disturb it! Don't disturb it!
I told you, don't disturb it!

GLENN: Gloves are good.

Seams good. Check.

Air pack at 100%.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: They're bringing</i>
<i>them out. There's 20 more in here.</i>

<i>MAN ON RADIO: Check the power</i>
<i>connection?</i>

(MACHINE BEEPING)

<i>WOMAN ON RADIO: Yeah, I'm pulling it up.</i>

<i>MAN ON RADIO:</i>
<i>Can I get a digital lock on that?</i>

(PHONE RINGS)

Arbogast.

Sir.

<i>CARRIE: Glenn, we've broken through.</i>

<i>CARRIE: Glenn, do you see this?</i>

Get that damned thing moving!

SOLDIER: Colonel Maitland, sir, it's for you.

Yeah, Maitland.

Tank? What kind of tank?

Design unknown. Contents unknown.

It's a 30-day job.
Metallurgy, ultrasound, x-ray.

Look, you got a containment setup

<i>MAITLAND ON PHONE: down there,</i>
<i>this is what your team is trained to do.</i>

<i>So open the damn thing,</i>
<i>figure out what's inside, neutralize it!</i>

I heard him, Glenn.
<i>- GLENN: Carrie...</i>

We'll take it one step at a time.

Promise me,
if you feel the slightest hesitation,

you'll back off, and we'll think it through.

Guys?

I'm good.
We can do this.

<i>STRUSS: Glenn, it's cool, man,</i>
<i>we got her back.</i>

<i>GLENN: Struss, there's a lot of jagged</i>
<i>concrete down there, so let's make sure</i>

<i>everybody watches for breaches</i>
<i>and tears in their suits.</i>

<i>CARRIE: What's our IAT?</i>

<i>I'm not seeing any container as waste.</i>

<i>STRUSS: I'm going up the ladder behind you.</i>

<i>CARRIE: Crane coming up, sir.</i>

<i>Breaking the seal.</i>

<i>Gayle, get this. Taking samples...</i>

<i>CARRIE: Percentages are rising.</i>

<i>Now, we're gonna do a panel.</i>

<i>STRUSS: Winch is good to go.</i>

<i>I'm coming down.</i>

<i>GLENN: Okay, guys, let's take it slow.</i>
<i>Let's get in and out.</i>

<i>CARRIE: Stand clear.</i>

<i>GLENN: Easy. Easy.</i>

<i>STRUSS: Container's open.</i>

<i>Equipment is stable.</i>

<i>GLENN: Now watch your heads.</i>

<i>What've you got, Carrie?</i>

<i>Somebody talk to me.</i>

<i>Laboratory detritus.</i>
<i>Petri dishes, rat cadavers.</i>

<i>CARRIE: Struss, MPP.</i>

<i>GLENN: All right, I'm setting for</i>
<i>a PCR sample.</i>

<i>MCQUEEN: Camera's up.</i>
<i>GLENN: Get a probe reading.</i>

It's formaldehyde.

Checking impurities.

<i>CARRIE: Flashing.</i>

(CARRIE GASPS)

<i>- GLENN: Carrie, what have you got?</i>
<i>- Rhesus monkey cadaver.</i>

<i>No disease apparent.</i>

<i>CARRIE: Struss, bring me an EVC, EFA 6243.</i>

One step at a time, Carrie.

<i>I'm going in closer now.</i>

<i>CARRIE: McQueen, are you getting</i>
<i>these images?</i>

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

<i>CARRIE: Flashing. Flashing.</i>

<i>- Jesus Christ!</i>
<i>- MCQUEEN: What was that?</i>

<i>CARRIE: Human cadaver. Diseased.</i>

Prepare a tissue panel.
Toxics, viral, bacterial.

<i>STRUSS: Yup, we've got three EVCs set up</i>
<i>when you're ready.</i>

What the hell is that?
It's a malignancy.

Freeborn, what does that mean?

Strange pattern. Characteristic
of a growth regulation nucleus.

<i>OSTERLOH: Tank temperature rising.</i>
<i>CARRIE: Clear these animals.</i>

<i>CARRIE: I'll get a specimen</i>
<i>of the diseased tissue.</i>

<i>STRUSS: Carrie, you want to put</i>
<i>the specimen in an EVC or a DH2?</i>


<i>MCQUEEN: What happened?</i>
<i>- Diseased tissue is active!</i>

Come on, Carrie, abort!

Get out of there.
Get the hell out of there, now!

<i>Drop the lid! Seal it!</i>

Carrie, abort! Get the hell out of there, now!

(ALARM RINGING)

Get out of here!
McQueen, get the hell out of here!

<i>CARRIE: Go, go, go, go!</i>

<i>I got it!</i>

<i>Keep going, go!</i>

GLENN: Get out! Get out!

Go!
Let's go.

ARBOGAST: We gotta get out of here, now!

Get on the elevator! Forget that!
SOLDIER: Hold it! Hold it!

Hold the elevator!

Glenn's down there!
Back off!

We gotta go back!
You'll get us all killed.

Emergency ladder. Go, go.
Ladder?

Honey, go. Go!
You go!

ARBOGAST: What happened?
Why are we stopping?

(ALL SCREAMING)

Aneta, go! Go! McQueen, move your ass!

Come on.

Go, Carrie! Just go!

Go!

Go!

Just go!

Hold on to my hand, Glenn!

Go! Go!
Glenn!

Move, God damn it!
Go!

Glenn!

Glenn!

(CARRIE SOBBING)

Let me out of here! Let me out of here!


(GUN FIRING)

FRANK: You opened it. You opened it,
didn't you?

Soldiers!
Friendlies out here. Specialist Freeborn.

Identify!

(SOLDIER STUTTERING)


<i>SOLDIER: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</i>
<i>We have three friendlies coming out.</i>

Zaremba! Ritz, can you see anything?

It's 10 miles south, headed in.

Evacuate!

Condition K-7. Fall back to Perimeter A.

SOLDIER: Fall back! Perimeter A! Fall back!

<i>SOLDIER: Say again...</i>

Say again. What's happening?

(DISTORTED VOICE ON RADIO)

Carrie, I'm so sorry.

It's biological. Living tissue.
Growth rate off any known scale.

That thing?
That's what my mother knew about?

She said don't disturb it.

She wasn't crazy.

You know more about this.
You need to tell me everything!

I told you all I know. I said don't disturb it,

and you did. It's not about me anymore.

Sublevel 3, Vault 12
contained a sealed tank.

Inside that tank
was a diseased body of a man.

The organism grew out of this man's body.

What you saw grew out of this man.

Where did you get this?
The face, Frank. Look at it.

You were born March 13, 1959.

Your mother worked here
nine months before that.

I told you everything I know.
I can't help you anymore.

<i>This is Colonel Erik Maitland, sir.</i>

<i>LAVIGNE: Colonel, we're advised</i>
<i>of your situation.</i>

<i>MAITLAND: I don't think you know</i>
<i>what we're dealing with down here, sir.</i>

<i>I got a biological outbreak.</i>
<i>Nothing we threw at it made a dent!</i>

<i>LAVIGNE: You have your orders, Colonel.</i>
<i>This is a contain and destroy operation.</i>

<i>Your job is to contain</i>
<i>the civilian population.</i>

<i>- Our job is to destroy the enemy.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

Sergeant Kinoshita.
Colonel Maitland, sir.

Set up a command post in here.
Board up that plate glass.

I want a secure line to weapon command.

Yes, sir.
Shourt! Fernandes!

Sir! Colonel Maitland.

Establish perimeter control.
Keep those civilians back.

Kinoshita.
Sir.

Put spotters on the roofs.
I want one there... There and there.

Yes, sir.

Sir,

the civilian, Frank Sears,
is connected to the organism.

His past might help us understand
the nature of the organism.

Specialist Freeborn,
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

We need cooperation at the highest level.

All classified records from Washington

related to programs at Fort Lambert
in 1958.

Teegarden.
Sir.

That civilian is still a prisoner.
Set up a brig inside.

Sir.

Specialist, this is no longer a...

It is now a contain and destroy operation.
Those are my orders.

You'll report to Sergeant Kinoshita
for supply duty until further notice.

Is that understood?

Gates, Franklin, Zaremba!

All right, let's get these tables cleared off.
Put the maps over there, radio here.

Supply staff, set up over there.

I need every civilian out of here, right now.

Quickly, quickly. Secure the back door...

This morning...

The old Indian across the street,
he looked at me like... Like he knew me.

The man in the tank was your father, Frank.

Your biological father.

He knew my face.

He knew your father.

Sergeant Kinoshita's asking
for you now, sir.

MAN: Army dude says it's a drill.

WOMAN: They brought in toxic waste
and dumped it.

'Cause the Feds don't wanna give the land
to our people.

Your people? Miss 11%.
Screw you!

Like you're even half.

Stay clear of them Army soldiers, hear?
They're jumpy today.

All right.

Can I help you folks?
You recognized my face.

Sir, did you live here in 1959?

Grandpa, you know you've always
lived here, since you were born.

Kaz, go to the stockroom
and finish sweeping.

Look at my face.

A man worked at Fort Lambert in 1959.
He looked a lot like me.

I don't know anything about the base.

You used to work at Fort Lambert.
He's got a little forgetfulness issues.

But he's on meds and I help him.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

This is my mother. She worked here, too.

Grandpa, what's the matter?

Why is the Army in town?

Sir...

Virgil, that disease killed people today.

We need to find out what it is right now,
before anyone else dies.

What happened in 1959 at Fort Lambert?

The government swore me to secrecy.
Well, the secret's out.

We opened Vault 12.

VIRGIL: The man in the tank
is Yevgeni Tarasov, a scientist.

Defected here from Russia.

The government set him up at Lambert.

Your mother worked in his lab.

My job was feeding the monkeys,
cleaning up after them.

Toward the end, Yevgeni got sick.

Two days before he died,
he gave me a package.

He said never open it...

Unless a day like this would come.

The bridge is washed out.
We have to walk up this way.

Get the shovel out of the back of the truck.

Kaz, stay here.

Can you watch her?

Yes.

The package

Tarasov gave me is buried under here.

Where are your mommy and daddy?

My mommy left. But I talk to her sometimes.

My daddy's gone a lot
because he owns casinos.

I lost my doll.

We'll find it on the way back.

(BIRDS FLUTTERING)

What's the matter?
Nothing.

You stay there, okay?

You didn't know
Dr. Tarasov was your father, did you?


There's a lot of things I didn't know.

He was a genius, but then he would forget
to tie his shoes.

You know the type?

CARRIE: Kaz?

That's it.

Kaz?

Don't! Kaz!

Frank! It's here!

We've gotta get out of here, now!

Grandpa!
Go out the back door!

Come on!

Get out! Go! Go!

(VIRGIL SCREAMING)

It's coming from that way.

We need to head south, toward town.
Take Kaz. I'm gonna get the truck.

I'll meet you on the main road.

Sir. I've got captures off the M-28 bird.

Circumference exceeds 1,700 meters.

Play the time progression again.

Here's the last hour.

(PHONE RINGING)

MAITLAND: The growth rate has slowed.

Kinoshita.

Yes, sir. For you, sir. Pentagon.

Yes, sir.

Is there a satellite image
that could show us infrared?

That's for the Colonel to order.
He's got bigger matters to attend to.

It's my job to get him the best information.

Switching to real-time infrared.

MCQUEEN: Oh, my God!

Colonel Maitland, sir.
Yes, one moment, sir.

What?
It's growing underground.

CARRIE: Frank!

Frank! Come on!


Get in.

It's grown this much in an hour.

I don't know any plant or animal
that grows that fast, do you?

No, except on a microscopic scale.
Bacteria, viruses...

The Army will stop it, won't they?

Won't you?

Yes. We will.

But first we need to understand
what Dr. Tarasov was doing.

This is... That's what we found.

How do we watch this?
With a projector.

I know we need a projector.
Where do we find one?

My school has one.

WOMAN: Excuse me.
Can you tell us anything, please?

MAN: Did something happen at the base?
Well, what happened?

Daddy!

Kazzy!

I was so worried about you.

They blocked the roads.
I couldn't get home.

RUBY: These snakes are taking over
like nothing I've ever seen before.

You don't believe me, take a look.

Chopped the tail off with my ax,
but the bastard just kept growing at me.

Brother, I got out of there, quick.

Hell, Ruby, that's just an old lizard tail.

Been drinking bug killer again?

MAN: She ran out of Jim Beam.

CARRIE: Where did you find that?

Out on the other side,
where the power lines cross old Route 17,

you know, back side of Lambert?

Grandpa didn't get away.
Grandpa?

What are you talking about, Kazzy?

Giant weeds growing out of the ground up
at the old church, they got Grandpa.

MAN: She's talking about a root.

Okay.

Okay.
WOMAN: What's come up from the ground?

What the hell have you Army people
been doing out there at Lambert?

Calm down. The situation is under control.

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

Calm down. Everything is being
taken care of. Will you calm down?

At the rate it's growing,
how long before it gets here?

About two hours if the growth rate is linear.

And what if it's exponential?

Good thing about public schools is
they never throw anything away.

I was the AV guy in high school.

I've gotta get this analyzed.
I better fly this back to Washington.

I have to go back to my command post,
try to convince Colonel Maitland that this...

You're AWOL. They'll arrest you.
We don't have time for that.

You need a lab, I'll get you a lab.

<i>I do not envy your predicament.</i>

<i>If my wishes have been met,</i>

<i>you will see this only upon the dawn</i>
<i>of a global catastrophe.</i>

<i>Because they refused</i>
<i>to continue funding my experiments</i>

<i>in cellular regeneration.</i>

<i>They declared my work</i>
<i>hopeless and impractical.</i>

<i>The United States government</i>
<i>sees merit in my work</i>

<i>and takes me in like an orphan.</i>

<i>My new father is the United States Army.</i>

<i>I endeavored to create a biological weapon</i>

<i>An infectious organism</i>
<i>that cannot be destroyed</i>

<i>by any means,</i>

<i>I systematically exposed</i>
<i>many varieties of cells</i>

<i>to radiation, extreme acidity, high heat,</i>

Clustering behavior similar
to bacterial colonies.

<i>TARASOV: I grow increasingly depressed</i>
<i>until I realize, one night,</i>

<i>the answer to my quest</i>
<i>is growing inside my body.</i>

<i>I had exposed myself to the same elements,</i>

<i>and my cells had begun</i>
<i>a chain of mutation.</i>

<i>My healthy cells are being displaced</i>
<i>by malignant cells of incredible virulence.</i>

<i>My new cells simply absorb these elements</i>
<i>like a plant drinks in the sun,</i>

The flashes from Torbin's camera. Light.
Gunfire. Flame.

Anything we try to destroy

<i>Within two days, it invaded</i>
<i>every extremity of my body,</i>

<i>and it's accelerating.</i>

<i>More than a simple association of cells,</i>
<i>it's a single grand organism.</i>

That's my father.

<i>TARASOV: self-pollinating with others to</i>
<i>ensure maximum efficiency and survivability.</i>

<i>I have been unable to concoct...</i>

<i>No scheme of reversing the weakness</i>

<i>TARASOV: and flourishes...</i>

That'll do it. There.

Oh, my God! Frank!


Get away!

Oh.

You think that's funny, huh?
Yeah, paybacks are hell.

You need a break to go change
those underwear, homeboy?

Lick my balls, Zaremba.

(ZAREMBA LAUGHS)

Given the current rate of growth,
here's how big it will be tomorrow.

And the next day, and the next.

Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

(CELL PHONE RINGS)

Yes, sir, I will be ready
to receive General Lavigne.

Yes, thank you, sir.

Specialist Freeborn.

Freeborn, where the hell are you?

Sir, I have information
vital to the crisis at hand, sir.

Vault 12 housed the remains
of an experiment

<i>carried out in 1958 by Yevgeni Tarasov,</i>

a Russian scientist who defected to the US.

I have documentation related
to that program.

Freeborn, you are absent without leave.

You will report
to this command post immediately.

<i>CARRIE: I have analyzed a sample</i>
<i>of the organism. I know how it works.</i>

<i>You must cease all attacks on it.</i>

Any weapon you fire, any toxic substance,

heat or energy of any kind
will only make it stronger.

I just issued you a direct order.

<i>CARRIE: Sir, excuse me, but shut up</i>
<i>and listen.</i>

The civilian Frank Sears
has survived an infection.

<i>I believe he contains a genetic key</i>
<i>to destroying the organism.</i>

<i>In the meantime, turn off</i>
<i>all electricity in the valley</i>

and do not attack the organism,

<i>or it will provoke further growth.</i>

Those decisions
are no longer mine to make.

My command has been superseded.

<i>Now, because I respect</i>
<i>the recent loss of your husband,</i>

<i>I'll repeat my order to you one last time.</i>

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

Oh, God.


I beat it.

How do you feel?

Like I ran a marathon.

Only...
What?

Stronger.

Somehow.

Why?

Why did I survive?

You were born March 13, 1959.

Conceived nine months before that,
approximately June 13th, 1958.

By the progression of Dr. Tarasov's disease
in the film,

I think he got your mother pregnant
before the organism developed in him.

You inherited immunity traits from him
which predate the organism.

When you were infected,
these immune factors were awakened,

and your body was able to fight it off.

I think your tissue
now carries this immunity.

No, no, no, Frank.


Die. Die, you fucker.

It's an autoimmune reaction,
that's why it acts so fast.

Your DNA is so similar,
it's accepted by the organism,

but your immune factors attack it
from within, like a Trojan horse.

My father brought this plague
into the world.

I can destroy what he made.

I can make good on his mistake.

He didn't know what he was doing.

He was too driven.
He wasn't thinking about anyone else.

Let me take care of that.

If I didn't come here today,

and I didn't tell you what I knew,
what would have happened?

Sublevel 3 would have been filled
with concrete.

It would have been locked away
for another hundred thousand years.

We never would have known.

And none of this would have happened?

None of it.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry for your husband.


Company, attention!

At ease, people.

Colonel Maitland.
Yes, sir.

Carry on.

You received the transfer of authority?

Yes, sir, I've prepared briefs containing
all relevant operational information,

including...
Thank you, Colonel.

That'll be all.

Yes, sir.

All right, let's move out.

Private McQueen,
we're under orders to move out.

I've got one more document
coming in from the CIA.

Thirty more seconds.

SOLDIER: Let's move them out!
Move them out!

Our objective is to move every civilian
and ourselves south to Rio Rancho.

Go door to door.

Evacuees take nothing
but the clothes on their backs.

No pets. No excuses.

Ready to move out.

You, too. Shako squadron.

Sir. CIA confirms
there was a Dr. Yevgeni Tarasov

defected from the Soviet Union in 1958.

Army set him up here at Fort Lambert.
Carrie was right.

Tarasov specialized in cellular mutation
used as a biological weapon.

Too late for a history lesson.
We've got a town to evacuate.

But Colonel Maitland, sir!

You heard the Colonel, Private McQueen.
The time for questions is over.

We have orders to evacuate this town.

Yes, Sarge.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: A Unit 669 in position.</i>
<i>Commence firing.</i>

<i>Left flank, move north, helix 887.</i>


<i>MAN ON RADIO: Airborne 123, move out.</i>
<i>Helix 678, continue fire. Confirm.</i>

<i>Airborne 523, report position...</i>

(DISTORTED VOICES ON RADIO)


<i>MAN ON RADIO: It's inside!</i>


WOMAN: Somebody, please!
Tell us what's happening!

WOMAN: Please, somebody tell us
what to do!

The explosions are stimulating the growth.

It's here.

We've got to get those people out of here.

Get out there and deal with the situation.
Move it!

Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

WOMAN: Keep moving.

No, you don't need to run.
Just keep moving. Keep it slow, look out.

WOMAN: Sir, do you need some help?
As fast as you can. No pushing.

TEEGARDEN: Who ordered my bus
to get loaded?

CARRIE: Hey. Teegarden!

Sears, I should have known it was...
Teegarden, listen.

You've got to help. You've got to help.

You are absent without leave.
What do you think you're doing?

All right. Okay, go! Go!

CARRIE: Teegarden, stand down! Stop!
Damn it, what do you think you're doing?

Okay.

CARRIE: He's the only person
who can stop it.

CARRIE: He's the only one.

Teegarden, stand down. Stand down.
Freeborn, you have no authority here.

(ALL SCREAMING)

God damn it! Get out of the way!

(TEEGARDEN CHOKING)

Get these people out of here.

Go south.

Go south.

Pick up as many people as you can. Go!
Go, go!

Zaremba, take the street.
Shourt, clear the alley.

Alone?
Well, take Kinoshita with you.

Yes, sir.

I just spotted Freeborn on foot
heading west on Main.

Arrest her on sight.

Go, go, go!

<i>MAN 1 ON RADIO: Pull back.</i>

<i>MAN 2 ON RADIO: Give it everything</i>
<i>you've got!</i>

(STATIC ON RADIO)

All units, report!

Report! Somebody answer the damn radio!

(GLASS SHATTERING)

MAN: got it right here. Come on, Ozzie.

Are you under the bed? Ah, man.
Where did you get to, anyway?

Ozzie, come on back. I'm serious, now.

We need to get out of here.

Something's going on,
and you're gonna be in trouble,

and I don't want to have to...
KINOSHITA: Get out of here!

MAN: What? Dude... Quit shoving, man!
Get him out of here.

I'm not leaving here without my cat, man.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Here, I'll help you. Get in the car!
Start the ignition.

CARRIE: Drive south. As fast as you can.

(FRANK BREATHING HEAVILY)

(DOGS BARKING)

(DOGS YELPING)

You don't have enough blood, Frank.
You can't do it like this.

You're the key to destroying it,
but not if you bleed to death.

Come on, I have an idea! Come on!

Initiate scenario D.

Central Command, confirm!

Initiate scenario D. Confirm!

Confirm!


CARRIE: I can fly this.

I'll get us out of here.

There's an immunology lab in Albuquerque.
I'll take you there.

They can isolate the factors in your blood,

clone them, produce mass quantities
and spray by air.

That thing will cover
North America by then.

The sun's coming up in three hours.
That thing feeds off energy.

A square mile of the Earth's surface
gets enough sun in a day

to equal a two-kiloton atomic bomb.

That thing will grow out of control.

Glenn would know.

Yeah, he'd think this through.

He would know.

What would he know?

You knew him better than anyone else.

What would he be thinking right now?


Growth regulation nucleus.

What?

On Tarasov's chest, a radial growth.

Glenn said
it was a growth regulation nucleus.

On my father's body?

When a part of the organism is severed,
it tries to rejoin the main body.

A single organism,
its growth is regulated by the nucleus.

So if we kill the nucleus?

The growth will regulate to zero.

Then the whole thing dies.

You can drop me off at the base.

I'll find my father's body.

You'll never find Vault 12 by yourself.

I'll take you.

Carrie.

I have the immunity,

you don't.

I'll take you as far as I can.

Delta Charlie 2-8-1, Kirkland Tower.
Wind is 2-9-0 at 7.

<i>You are cleared for takeoff.</i>

MAITLAND: Freeborn.

What happened to you?

We found a way to kill the organism.
I'm flying us into Lambert.

And I'm ordering you to walk out that door.

Frank's blood can...
You are AWOL, Freeborn!

Look, sir, if I kill the nucleus...
One more word out of you...

Look, you didn't listen to me before
and look what's happening.

Colonel!
If you are within 10 miles of here

at 0430 hours, you will be dead.

This valley is going to be carpeted
by tactical nuclear warheads in 25 minutes.

It will feed on the radiation.
It feeds on any energy source.

You have to stop them.

I have no power to stop anything
but your death.

I respected the hell out of your husband.

Now, for his sake,
move of your own accord...

SOLDIER: Colonel Maitland.

Colonel!

Colonel Maitland, are you okay, sir?

Sir, we have an unidentified aircraft
moving northeast in the target zone.

Initiate Mike 86 warning protocol.
Proceed with attack plan.

Roger that, sir.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: Aircraft, flying</i>
<i>in Fort Lambert, heading on zero-five-niner,</i>

<i>you are in violation of restricted airspace.</i>

You need to immediately change course
to heading one-niner-zero.

<i>To repeat, heading one-niner-zero.</i>
<i>And leave that...</i>

<i>You are in violation</i>
<i>of government-restricted airspace.</i>

<i>Turn to one-niner-zero immediately.</i>

<i>You face an immediate military strike</i>
<i>on your aircraft.</i>

<i>I repeat, turn to one-niner-zero!</i>

<i>You are facing an immediate military strike</i>
<i>on your aircraft.</i>

<i>There will be no further communication.</i>

They're still heading zero-five-niner, sir.
They're not moving.

Take them down.
Roger that.

I've got to put this down! Brace yourself!

This goes down to Sublevel 3.

Bullets didn't matter.

Knives.

Guy has the touch, though. Didn't hurt him.

The thing frigging died
when he put his hands on it.

Teegarden, what the hell
are you talking about?

He's got the touch.

He saved my life.

Stop here and set up a Sat-link.

I want pictures.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: Point G-H-5-8</i>
<i>heading south.</i>

<i>Joint L-R-0-7-6, that's point G-H-43,</i>
<i>and proceed south.</i>

You got the coordinates set?

Yes, sir.

MCQUEEN: Infrared is up, sir.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: All units, proceed south</i>
<i>to green line. Confirm positions on arrival.</i>

<i>All units, proceed south to green line</i>
<i>at maximum speed.</i>

MCQUEEN: This is Fort Lambert, two minutes
ago. Last pass of the satellite.

Widen the view.

SHOURT: Crap!

MAITLAND: Zoom in. Track that movement
to the left.

MCQUEEN: Look, there they are.

Oh, my God. They're alive.

Vault 12 is that way, at the end.

Glenn! Glenn! Glenn!

Glenn! Glenn!


(CARRIE SCREAMING)

CARRIE: Frank!

Help, Frank, help!

Help! Frank!

Sir, something's happening.

The sucker's dying.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: Proceed south immediately.</i>

Make sure Air Force Regional Command
is seeing this.

Yes, sir.
Bombers incoming, sir.

This is Colonel Erik Maitland,
United States Army.

Request emergency interrupt
for General Torrence.

Look at your IRSat incoming.

The organism is dying.

I have personnel trapped
inside the blast zone.

Sir, strongly recommend
you abort mission.

Over.

<i>MAN ON RADIO: Delta Charlie 2-8-1,</i>
<i>abort mission.</i>

I repeat, abort mission, Delta Charlie 2-8-1.

<i>PILOT ON RADIO: Roger, Command.</i>
<i>Delta Charlie 2-8-1 returning to base.</i>


Could they have survived?

Whether they made it or not,
we're gonna be the ones to pull them out.

Let's move out.
Yes, sir!

Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
