[bright tone]

Are you ready to go?

[audience cheering]

One minute, everybody.

Stand by, camera one.

[man speaking indistinctly]

[cheers and applause]

All right, here we go.

Six, five, four,

three, two...

[cheers and applause]

<i>[dynamic rock music]</i>

<i>"Real Time" is Bill Maher</i>
is bull's-eye.

<i>It's simultaneously topical,</i>

<i>it's insightful,</i>
<i>it's controversial</i>

and provocative,
but it's funny as hell.

Trump's got a big trip.

He's going to Saudi Arabia,

Israel, and the Vatican--

the cradles of America's
three great religions:

Christianity, Judaism, and oil.


When did it all go to shit?

When your first
sexual experience is with

your cousin or a goat,
you'na be up for grabs.


Have you ever had sex
with a Republican?

I don't know.
I don't get their names.

But what I'm interested in...

Bill focuses
on important topics

but shows that you don't have
to choose between

<i>being entertained</i>
<i>or being educated.</i>

You feel like you left here
learning something.

Yeah.
This is so--

so much better than television.


<i>It takes pretty giant balls</i>

to be that comfortable

<i>with a political show</i>
<i>where you don't know</i>

<i>what's gonna come up...</i>

I'm gonna run out of time
before we hit all the issues

that mightet y fired
from your next movie.


[laughter and applause]

How can such
a nice-looking person

be so screwed up inside?

[laughter and applause]

Could you move
further away from me, please?

Don't recoil, Bill!

These chairs have got
wheels on them for a reason.

<i>He's an iconoclast</i>

<i>and a freethinker.</i>

And he says things that no one
else would say in public.

<i>He is outrageous.</i>

<i>I think he's irreverent</i>
<i>to the point</i>

it drives me crazy.

Preach, Bill, preach.

<i>And yet he's probably</i>
<i>the funniest guy around.</i>

If America had a government
as good as its people,

it wouldn't look like this...

Further consideration
of HR-7-6-1...

It would look like this...

[indistinct shouting]

Oh, I touched the "politically
correct" nerve there.

There iso dot that corporations

own this country.

What?

The truth.
Yeah, I...

<i>What he is on television</i>

<i>is authentic,</i>

and if you are authentic,

theris huge power to that.

<i>Start the clock.</i>

<i>[dynamic rock music]</i>

<i>Right here with me.</i>

<i>Hmm...</i>

Bill Maher, Bill Maher.

Comedian?

<i>I first met Bill</i>
<i>at Catch a Rising Star</i>

<i>in 1979.</i>

<i>Uh, Monday night</i>
<i>was audition night,</i>

and it was up to the emcee--

and that particular night,
it was me--

uh, to decide who got passed

and--and who would get
to go on during the week

and start working
out of the club.

Bill auditioned, and having
the tremendous eye for talent

that I do, I said,

"Hey, you're terrific.

"Why don't--why don't you
and start working out here?"

<i>Bill Maher has arrived.</i>

<i>An Ivy League education</i>
<i>is not enough for some people,</i>

<i>the call of the stage</i>
<i>too great.</i>

We were doing a story
on an up-and-coming comic

at t time, and who knew
that 35 years later,

we'd wind up
in the same stable?


<i>I first saw him</i>
<i>on "The Tonight Show,"</i>

and I thought,
"Well, who's this guy?"

My mother is Jewish,
and my father is Catholic.

That is the truth.

I was raised Catholic formally.

Although I must say,
the Jewish mind comes out

even in the Catholic system.

Uh, give you an example, uh,
we used to go into confession,

and I would bring
a lawyer in with me.

[laughter and applause]


It's true. You know.

Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

I think you know Mr. Cohen.


<i>You know, it's interesting</i>
<i>where comics start out</i>

<i>and where they end up.</i>

Some end up in movies.
Some end up in sitcoms.

Some end up just being

concert performers, you know.

And--and Bill ended up becoming

this guy.

[cheers and applause]

Okay, well,

thank you,
and hi, I'm Bill Maher,

and this is
"Politically Incorrect."

"Politically Incorrect" was--

I was 35 or something
when I started it.

<i>The idea was always--</i>
<i>from the beginning</i>

<i>and to this day--</i>

to approximate...

what goes on in my life

when I'm just hanging out
with my friends.

I always saw the show
as a cocktail party

with the audience as just

one more friend.

All right,
fasten your seat belts

for a bumpy ride.
Let's get to the issues!


Put your thinking cap on.
All right.

43% of--
of Evangelical Christians

believe that the devil
is to blame

for the gay rights movement.

The--the other 57% think

it is the, uh,
high school music teachers.

That's...
[laughter and applause]

You've said that 1995
is the year of the penis.

What can we expect?

I support hunters having guns

'cause that increases the odds
of two rednecks

blowing each other's heads off.


You seriously think...
Wait a minute.

You're gonna run out of air?
I do.

I think there's a hole
in the ozone layer,

I think there's global warming,

I think the ice caps
are melting,

and when I die,
I'm blaming you.

<i>I certainly had never seen</i>
<i>a show like it.</i>

He was deliberately
being provocative

because he's always been
infuriated by the fear

<i>of shaking it up...</i>
I'm leaving.

<i>Of saying things that,</i>

<i>"Oh my God, what if people</i>
<i>get upset by that?</i>

Now, I myself do not have sex

with men or with little boys--

I'm not nearly that religious.


But...

[cheers and applause]

ThePartnershipke
for a Drug-Free America.

Can you imagine America
without drugs,

without their coffee,

without their amphetamines,
their diet pills,

their scotch, their Prozac,
their Valium?

This country is floating
in drugs.

<i>This was sharp.</i>
<i>This was take no prisoners.</i>

<i>And I thought, in that sense,</i>
<i>it redefined</i>

whatou could do with comedy

and with political commentary.

Chris, uh, how did you find
New Hampshire itself?

This is, I assume,
your first trip up there.

It's, um--it's--

This is America.

This is-- this is a really,

really, really white town.

This is, uh...

I'm having a real hard time...
Yeah.

Trying to find
hair care products here.

[laughter and applause]

Really...


<i>Bill's biggest influence</i>
<i>in comedy</i>

has always been Johnny Carson,

and so Bill not only
admired the interviews,

not only admired the monologue,

but he also admired

Art Fern or Aunt Blabby.

Good evening.

I am the beautifu.


Certainly don't want
any violence.

Let's bring her out!

Monica! Monica!

[audience booing]

<i>So we did sketches</i>
<i>for a long time</i>

<i>that kind of served to be</i>

<i>a bridge between</i>

more traditional
talk-variety formats

and then the absolutely
revolutionary format

that we were moving toward.

Once New York starts
going down--

or LA, which is certainly
going down,

um, as we speak.

'Cause of the earthquake.

I get it.

Do you want to screw
Margaret Thatcher?

Yes or no.

There's your answer!

It's been-- it's been a while

since I've been with
a older white woman.




"Politically Correct"
was a designed train wreck

Oh, yeah!

<i>The whole point of the show</i>
<i>was that you were</i>

<i>putting together people</i>
<i>who shouldn't be</i>

talking to each other.

Cool!

Janeane Garofalo
right over there!

Glad you can join us.
It's great to be here,

especially for me to be
back together

with all these nuts again, huh?

You will treat me

and every other woman
with respect...

I don't mean here.
And dignity!

<i>And sometimes it--</i>

<i>it just revealed</i>

what a crazy
Democratic nation we are,

where everyone gets a say.

And everyone did.
I'm sure you do.

And I am tired of the press
getting beat up.

Oh, of course you are,
'cause you are the most

hypersensitive people in
the United States of America.

[laughter and applause]

<i>I loved that he would</i>
<i>bring in guests</i>

from opposite ends
of the political spectrum

d everywhere in between,
and he could talk

<i>to everyone and challenge them</i>

<i>or agree with them</i>

<i>and back up his opinion</i>
<i>with facts.</i>

I always learned something

from watching his shows.

I'm a communist,
and I think that the people

should have control

over their own destiny...
By the way...

And over the profits...
Did you read any

of the history
of the 20th century?

'Cause they did try communism.

You defended the Menendez kids.

What do you care about facts?
ll, e, you absolutely

don't know anything
about the facts.

I knew they blew
their parents' heads off.

No, they didn't.
What did they do?

They--they, uh,
unloaded shotguns

in their direction,
but they didn't

blow their heads off.

Hey!

I distinctly remember
all the critics saying,

"This person is crazy.

"The one area you never
want to do

for entertainment--
that's poison--is politics."


And definitely don't have
your own opinions.

You know, definitely the host

was not supposed
to have opinions.

Isn't a religion just a cult
that doesn't have

to pay taxes,
and shouldn't it pay them?

What about suggesting
that parents watch their kids

instead of trying--
as we seem to be doing--

to childproof the world?

Does show business
turn people into jerks,

or are jerks attracted
to show business?

Who is writing this show?

This is unbelievable.

I just fell in love with him

fr that first day.

<i>He was irreverent.</i>

<i>He said things that</i>
<i>you thought to yourself,</i>

"Did he just say that?"

If being single was a disease,

I could listhe symptoms:

extra money, self-reliance,

and not needing
a special holiday to remind us

to get laid.

<i>And then you said, "Yes,</i>
<i>he just said that."</i>

And it was really,
really funny,

and then you realize
that it was also

<i>really, really wise.</i>
Now, America, we're told,

is a land where anybody
can grow up to be president,

but I think even Betsy Ross

would have added, "Yeah,
but for God's sake,

not Donald Trump."


<i>From the beginning,</i>
<i>people thought</i>

"Politically Incorrect"
was just a cute...

saying, but it's actually

something
that meant something to me.

<i>The world</i>
<i>was too politically correct.</i>

<i>I still think the world</i>
<i>is too politically correct.</i>

<i>Now, that's not to say</i>
<i>that there aren't some areas</i>

where we do evolve.

I've gotten a lot of mail
from women who say,

you ow"When you bring women
on the show"--

I very often have
a bad habit of--

a lot of times, I know them,
and I say, "Hey, beautiful,"

or some word like that.

Hey, baby.
How are you, baby?

Hey, baby.
Hiya, doll.


How you been?
Oh, man,

you must be getting a lot.

Eh, you don't want
to talk about it here.

Hey, beautiful.
How you doing?

Nice to see you.

Go ahead.

[whists and applause]

I'm gonna miss doing that.

I like it, but I have
learned something:

if it hurts a woman,
just don't do it.

Doesn't matter--you don't have
to know why.

So I promise
I won't do it anymore.

<i>It</i> and it didn't mean <i>cept</i>
<i></i>liberal or conservative.<i>,</i>

It just meant the opposite
of politically correct,

which was bullshit.

I always used to definit
the elevation

of sensitivity over truth.

<i>This just in,</i>
<i>you are looking at,</i>

<i>obviously, a very disturbing</i>
<i>live shot there.</i>

Th is the <i>World Trade Center,</i>

<i>and we have unconfirmed reports</i>

<i>this morning that a plane</i>
<i>has crashed into one</i>

<i>of the towers</i>
<i>of the World Trade Center.</i>

<i>Six days after 9/11,</i>

the president,
George Bush, had said,

"Unless you go back to doing
what you normally do,

the terrorists win."

I took that seriously.

Now, I hope, panel,
that you answer

with total candor,

because
political correctness itself...

is something we can
no longer afford.

Feelings are gonna get hurt

so that actual people won't.

And then the first show back,
you know, I was like

the guwho--first guy
on that beach landing

when the thing opens
when they hit the beach...

[mimics gunshot]
Bullet right there.

One of the themes
that we hear constantly

is that the people
who did this are cowards.

Not true.
Not true.

Look at what they did.
First of all...

We're the cowards.
You have a whole bunch

of guys...
Right.

Who are willing
to give their life.

None of them backed out.

All of them slammed themselves

into pieces of concrete.
Exactly.

These are warriors.
Right.

Uh, and we have to realize
that the principles

of our way of life, uh,
are in--in conflict

with people in the world.

And so, I mean,
I'm all for understanding

the sociological causes
of this,

but we should not
blame the ctim.

American's shouldn't
blame themselves

'cause other people
want to bomb them.

But also, we-- we should make--

we have been the cowards
lobbing cruise missiles

from 2,000 miles away.

That's cowardly.
That--that is...

Staying in the airplane
when it hits the building--

say what you want about it,
not cowardly.

You're right.

<i>After the fact,</i>
<i>people were sensitive,</i>

<i>and anybody that moved into</i>

that sensitive territory was--
was going to pay the price.

<i>ABC had no problems that night,</i>

<i>the night of the taping.</i>

<i>It only became</i>
<i>a line crossed later,</i>

when conservative
morning disc jockeys

started getting
their listeners--

who maybe had never seen
"Politically Incorrect" --

to start calling advertisers
and get them

to drop the show.

<i>In the new</i>
<i>cultural mind-set known as</i>

<i>"post-attack Ameri</i>

<i>it is no longer okay</i>
<i>to be politically incorrect,</i>

<i>even on a show</i>
<i>by the same name.</i>

<i>FedEx, Sears,</i>
<i>and General Motors</i>

<i>quickly pulled out</i>
<i>of the irreverent</i>

<i>late-night program.</i>

<i>You only get in trouble</i>
<i>for telling the truth.</i>

Nobody gets in trouble
for lying

or making up crap,
but when you tell something

that's really true,
they go crazy and you're fired.

<i>[tense music]</i>

<i>It's amazing to me</i>
<i>that you could be</i>

<i>literally sitting under a sign</i>

<i>that says</i>
<i>"Politically Incorrect"</i>

and that you have actually
said to the audience,

"If you don't like edgy,
keep-it-real stuff,

do not watch this,"

<i>and they still don't care</i>

<i>and still want you to go away.</i>

That's what blows my mind
is that people

who don't watch you
still get to have a say

in whether you're on or not.

When people say, "Why don't you
run for office?"

or, "Why'd you get fired?"

Folks, let me sum it up
for you:

I think religion is bad

and drugs are good.

[laughter and applause]

I think America causes cancer,

longevity is less important
than fun,

and young people should be
discouraged from voting.

[laughter and applause

So... d young people should be

<i>It's insane</i>
<i>that the only person</i>

<i>who lost their job after 9/11</i>

was a comedian who hosted

a late-night
television program.

That was--and remains today--
bullshit.

[cheers and applause]

<i>I was not planning to leave...</i>

When I got fired.

<i>It seemed like the worst thing</i>
<i>in the world at the time,</i>

but it was the best thing.

[TV static drones]

[bright tone]

[cheers and applause]

<i>[saucy pop music]</i>

Oh, stop.

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

Oh, stop.

[cheers and applause]

Stop!

Oh, please.

<i>It says a lot</i>
<i>about his character</i>

<i>that he didn't try</i>
<i>to change whhe was,</i>

<i>and so he decided</i>
<i>to find a venue that would be</i>

more amenable
to his kind of comedy

and his kind of authenticity.

And to HBO's credit,
they took a risk,

and they were rewarded
handsomely.

ct is that any enterprise

that excludes women
almost always descends

into sexual deviancy--

at least at my bathhouse.

[cheers and applause]

Whether it's the Boy Scouts,

the Penn State locker room,
or on Wall Street,

sooner or later, a bunch
of innocent folks get fucked.


Americans don't want privacy.

They want attention.

They'll put a camera
in their shower

and show it on the Internet.

<i>You need three qualities,</i>
<i>really,</i>

<i>to be a--a great comedian.</i>

One is that, obviously,

you have to be funny.

<i>He's not just funny.</i>
<i>He's quick.</i>

<i>It never ceases to amaze me,</i>
<i>some of the stuff</i>

that he can come out with
on the spot on that show.

Go, Bernie!

Bernie!
[cheers and applause]

[both laughing]

You are more popular
than Stormy Daniels' lawyer.


And you have to be smart,

which he is.

<i>He--he can handle discussions</i>

<i>on a wide variety of subjects.</i>

And the third quality, I think,

and that's really
iswhat sets him apart. ve,

I think all Americans would say

to the police everywhere,
"We want to support you,

"even to love you,
but you have to remember

"it says 'to protect and serve'
on the side of the car,

not 'what the fuck
are you okinat?'"

[laughter and applause]

We have been chosen here
at "Real Time"

to host the fifth annual

fall fundamentalist
fashion show.


And you are gonna love this.

Could we have our first model,
please?

This outfit just screams,
"Look out, world,

I'm a woman
of the 12th century."


There's really not
a lot of avenues

for, uh, people
who speak their mind

and really speak the truth

<i>in the face of sometimes</i>
<i>a lot of adversity.</i>

My sense of why people tune in

to watch Bill is,
they're watching a week

of crap, nonsense, craziness...


<i>And they're--they're waiting</i>
<i>for someone smart,</i>

<i>funny, and interesting...</i>
Wow.

And, you know, no bullshit
to make sense of it.

We don't need new ideas.

We need the balls to implement

the ideas we already know work.

Cut corporate welfare.

[cheers and applause]

Slash the defense budget.

Tax the rich.
Support the strong unions

that created a middle class
in the first place.

[cheers and applause]

<i>I am very lucky</i>
<i>to work with people</i>

who are incredibly funny,

smart, uh, dedicated,

nice--

much nicer than me--

<i>and the favorite part of my day</i>

<i>is the writers' meeting.</i>

<i>Every time I walk into</i>
<i>the writers' meeting,</i>

<i>it's been the same.</i>

I walk in there
with a look on my face

like my mother just died...

because one time, she did.

And so I never want them

to know if something bad
is going on in my life.

And the other reason I do it
is because

I want to be a tough crowd

for those writers
and producers.

I-I know that
when they make me laugh--

'cause I'm pretty jaded--

then we got something.

What defense spending really is

is a giant welfare program,

a jobs program
for defense workers

to build crap we don't need...

<i>You know, there's basically</i>
<i>two kinds of talk shows.</i>

<i>There's entertainment ones--</i>
<i>you know, the ones</i>

on late night--
and then there's

the cable news shows,

but this is not like
either one of those.

It's totally original format.

Here's how Sean Spicer

explained alternative facts.

He said it's like
the weather report.

One weather report comes out

and says it's gonna be cloudy.

Another says there's gonna be
light rain.

No one lied to you.

Yeah, you know, sometimes
weathermen do disagree

on what the weather's
gonna be like tomorrow.

But not on what it was like
yesterday!


[cheers and applause]

I think, as the show
has evolved, it's hit upon

a terrific structure
with the short monologue,

<i>then the interview</i>
<i>with a single guest,</i>

<i>then the panel,</i>
<i>then someone comes out</i>

<i>in the middle of the panel</i>
<i>to kind of give it</i>

<i>a little bit of a bump,</i>
<i>and then you end</i>

on a crescendo
with "New Rules."

New rule: I don't care
if Henry Kissinger

is a war criminal
when he starts melting.


You don't just there
and make vagina hands.


New rule: you can't look
at the before and after

and tell me these two
didn't do it on the ane.

New rul[laughter]'t look
at the before and after

New rule:
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

has to try to look
a little less

like the roommate who comes
to the door and says,

"She doesn't want to see you."


<i>"New Rules" is genius.</i>

<i>If something can make you laugh</i>

and also keep you engaged,

it's pretty great television.

New rule: since our new
national position

on science is, "Screw it,
we prefer witchcraft..."


Let's not just retire
the space shuttle "Atlantis."

Let's drive it to one
of the five stupidest states

and have the locals
beat it with sticks.


New rule: The people--
oh, you're not gonna like

this one...

The people who participate
in the ultra-Orthodox

atonement ritual of kaparot,

where you swing a live chicken
over your head three times

and read Bible passages
while someone else

holds a baby...

have to look me in the eye
and tell me

there's not some point
in the ceremony

where you're thinking,
"What the fuck are we doing?"


Okay, new rule:

if the tabloids are going
to continue to call

these two "Kimye"
and these two "Billary"

and these two "J-Rod,"

they must refer to these two
as "Shitstorm."

[laughter and applause]

My favorite pais the e.

<i>It's sort of Bill</i>

<i>in his full intensity.</i>

<i>You feel like</i>
<i>watching the eclipse.</i>

You know, you have
to wear glasses

because sometimes
it's so intense.

This country
is in quite a pickle.

Conservatives govern
without shame,

and liberals shame
without goveing.

Conservatives govern
[cheers and applause]

<i>Some of them</i>
<i>are enormously complex.</i>

And, as always,
they are very ballsy,

and they're very honest.

When did the American dream

become this pathwayndent,

this economic death spiral
where workers get paid

next to nothing
so they can only afford

to buy next to nothing
so business are forced

to sell cheaper
and cheaper shit?

Walmart employees can only
afford to shop at Walmart.

McDonald's workers can only
afford to eat at McDonald's.

And Hoers itresses
have to wear shirts

they grew out of years ago.


Europe and Latin America,
they take a break every day

between noon and 3:00,
and they call it a siesta.

But let's face it.

[laughter and applause]

They're fucking in the day,
and we're not.


<i>Bill's editorials</i>
<i>are a lot like the show--</i>

<i>that it's this blend</i>
<i>of passion,</i>

politics, and insights
but then also humor.

Now the white supremacists

are the federal government.

And it's liberal states
that are under siege

from federal overreach.

We're trying to defend
our way of life here

and what we believe in.

We believe in sanctuary cities
and pollution controls...

[cheers and applause]

And legalized pot
and gun control

and Obamacare and a woman's
right to choose,

and we're going to defend them.

theebels now!

[cheers and applause]

There's a specific group
of Americans out there

whose name I won't mention,
but it begins with "tea"

and ends with "baggers"...


No, in America,
when a man puts something

in another man,
it had better be a bullet.


There's only one thing
conservatives believe in more

than work, and that's
the God-given right

of rich people to leave
all their money to their kids

so they never have to work
a day in their lives.

[laughter and applause]

Meanwhile, on the other side
of the world,

this man--
ex-KGB agent Vladimir Putin,

AKA Vlad Bat

AKA The Bodfather...


Is looking to install a stooge

in the country he still hates.

But who?

Who's desperate
and dumb enough?


<i>And the dience,</i>
<i>all of their defenses</i>

are coming down.

All of their force fields
are lowered.

"Oh, this is fun.

I like this man.
He's making me laugh."

And then he--when those
force fields are down,

en he zaps them.
We tell our children

they don't have to fix
their flaws

because it's the world's job

to accept everything
about them and love it.

Like they say on reality shows,

the most important thing
is just you doing you.

But what if you
is a big asshole?

[laughter and applause]

<i>He really sets up the argument</i>

in a very logical way,

uh, like a procuto

and at the same time
makes you laugh.

That's an incredible gift.

I don't know
the exact definition

of white privilege,
but being able to talk about

grabbing pussies
and how big your dick is

and still getting
elected president--

that's gotta come close.

[with Southern accent]
You know, uh, we don't need

no outside agitators...


With their "Make America
Great Again" caps

coming in here
to our clean state

and telling uso ta down
our solar panels...


Or how to treat our interns.


Here in our state,
we use tiki torches

they way they're supposed
to be used--

for lesbian weddings
on the beach.

[laughter and applause]

<i>After the show is over,</i>
<i>I start to go over it</i>

<i>in my mind:</i>

<i>"Oh, I should have said this.</i>

<i>Oh, I shouldn't have</i>
<i>said that."</i>

<i>That's why I love</i>
<i>the editorial,</i>

because I get to work on it
all week long.

Sometimes I put in 12, 15 hours

to make five or six minutes,
but I get to say it

exactly the way I want
to say it,

and it's always something
that no one else is saying

and we make it funny,
and, uh...

that's--that's my joy.

<i>[laughter]</i>

Ready, four.
And take.

<i>One of the ways in which</i>
<i>our show is unique</i>

is that we have almost
a true hour on air

<i>completely uninterrupted</i>
<i>by commercials,</i>

<i>so Bill is doing</i>
<i>this obstacle course</i>

every week,
which is incredible.

We think of Megyn Kelly
as the sane one

over there at Fox News.

That's just because
she's surrounded

by Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.

She's like the blonde
dragon girl

on "Game of Thrones."

Everyone else is a zombie
or a dwarf

or fucking their sister,
so she looks normal.


<i>If you think</i>
<i>about the monologues</i>

<i>of the late-night shows</i>
<i>that sometimes have politics,</i>

it was all very tame,
very bland, and that--

that stuff came out
of the Bob Hope era,

if you will.

This was a whole
different thing.

Anytime someone
prefaces a statement

by saying, "I'm not a racist,"

some racist shit is about
to come out of them.

Now, I mean...

He wanted to outlaw blow jobs,

and he lost single women

in the state by 43 points.

But listen to this.
He won married women

by nine.

[laughter and applause]

And...

that is all I need
to know about marriage.

That's--that's all I'm saying.

The budget director also said
about the new budget

that the after-school
meals program--gone.

You know, I've always
said this.

You want Republicans
to care about kids,

you're gonna just have
to jam them back in the uterus.


There's almost nothing
on televisn

that goes out live-live

with no tape delay
and they can't bleep you;

<i>you can say anything you want.</i>

<i>And I think that kind of</i>
<i>edge of danger</i>

<i>is very good for thshow</i>

<i>and I think</i>
<i>it's very good for him.</i>

<i>A lot of shows are like a play,</i>

<i>where there's a script</i>
<i>and it gets rehearsed</i>

<i>over and over</i>
<i>and then it gets taped.</i>

<i>And our show is more like</i>
<i>a sporting event,</i>

where there are umpires,

there's--there's spectators,

there's one team,
there's the other team,

and then once the game begins,
nobody knows exactly

what's going to happen.
<i>I'm sorry, but it's time</i>

for a comedy bit.
Okay.

augh [mimics cracking]


[speaking indistinctly]

Can I use this for a second?


<i>Being on "Real Time,"</i>
<i>it's like the most interesting</i>

dinner party you ever had
with people that

you don't know very well
but you know of them.

And it's
a fascinating conversation,

and then you realize
it's all taking place

on a high wire 100 stories
above the ground,

and one false move
and you're cooked.

The Obama administration
really has to stop

completely blaming everything

on its predecessor completely.

And I really--
I'm sick of hearing,

"Oh, well, we were handed this.

We were handed this."
I know.

Everyone knows,
but we need to move on.

You think that's
what Obama's doing?

You think he's doing that?
I do, to a degree.

Not nearly enough.

Ronald Reagan
blamed Jimmy Carter every day

for eight years.

[cheers and applause]

No--and in the speech--

in the speech,
what President Bush said--

one of the things
he's had to adjust to...

Yeah, I wasn't born yet,
so I don't know.

Well, that's...

I-I wasn't born during
the French Revolution,

but know about it.

[cheers and applause]

[indistinct chatter]

It comes out this week
that Reince Priebus

was talking to the FBI--

he's the chief of staff.

That really is booze.
No, it's not.

You wish it was

after I finish this question.


Things that are in the Bible

that if we took it
literally true:

uh, "slaves must
submit themselves

to their masters,
no matter how harsh."

Right--right off the bat,
we're believing in slavery.

[audience murmurs]

Well...

<i>Bill's success is that</i>
<i>you gotta come prepared.</i>

There are no free passes.

Uh, he's not interested
in sycophants.

He's not interested
in the pabulum

of usual exchange.

<i>You gotta bring your "A" game.</i>
This is a tough guy

to argue with.

But I mean, look...

Okay, so, Bill, listen...
Hey, if it makes you

feel better, I feel like
I'm in high school again,

where I'm just sitting there
like, "I'm not passing

this class."


You always have said to me,

"I'm too stupid
to do your show."

No, no, I-- no, I didn't say--

Have you gotten smarter?
No, sadly.

I saw you a while ago,
and you said something

that changed it, and you said--
I think it was a compliment--

you said, "Oh, are you kidding?

We have guests
much stupider than you."


Listen, they gave me
water tonight.

I got nothing.
I know. I know.

Maybe you got his booze.
Is that what he said?

Could we get Darrell Issa's,

uh, Jack Daniels for...

Let's deal with serious issues.

I know.
You know, fuckups

are fuckups, but when you
don't bring Seth MacFarlane

his liquor...
You're wondering why

he's so quiet right now.
It's not gonna be

a good show.
You know it.


Thank you so much.
<i>Most other shows,</i>

<i>you only get people</i>
<i>to talk real once you get</i>

<i>off the set into the greenroom,</i>

and what Bill has managed to do

is get the greenroom
conversation on the set.

What is it you never liked
about men?

No, I'm just kidding.

There you go.

[gravelly voice]
That's messed up.


Never thought I'd hear
Tucker Carlson say

"tapping her."

He was involved--
he was involved with her

when she was underage.
No, no, you were right.

Tapping.
[overlapping chatter]

You came out.
Um, George Takei--

Mr. Sulu...
[overlMm-hmm. atter]

Also came out.
Is it something with the ship?


Before the crash,
I had most of my savings

Lehman Brothers.

Ah.

I don't have a question.
I just want you to hold me.


Took me forever
to get you here,

but I knew it would happen.

Well, I had to start reading.
Yeah.

You...

<i>Our show is the hardest show</i>
<i>on television to do.</i>

You can't just come on
and give the same

talking points you give
on other shows.

<i>Even celebrities have</i>
<i>to be on their feet with Bill.</i>

<i>He doesn't treat them</i>
<i>any differently</i>

<i>than his other guests.</i>
I say this as a friend...

And as someone who I think

has impeccable credentials
as a stoner.


You smoke too much pot.

You smoke...

You are the most gorgeous
old lady in the world.

[cheers and applause]
You're beautiful.

You went to Haiti.
You went to Cuba.

You went to Venezuela,
Iran, Iraq.

What's wrong with you?


Is that why
you're on this show?

I can't...

I'm not sure why
I'm on this show

There is a litany of things
out there that can kill you,

but it--you...
Hair dye.

Oh, absolutely.
Come on.

But people--here's...

How many of your guests
have stalked off?


I just called him
a bad motherfucker.


I been waiting to use that word
on television

for, what, 15 years.

I know you're concerned
about bad language.

I tried to clean that up
for you tonight.

I'm telling you,
that could have been worse.

It usually is.

It is a great feeling
of freedom

when you can say anything

and they're like,
"No, say anything."

I mean, you know, you--
you could be a diva

and you're not.

First of all,
people who say they're divas...

I--you're not a diva.

I think--I'm pretty sure
you're a cunt.

Can I say that?

<i>It is a dirty show,</i>

but it's not really my fault.

The world is dirty,
the people are dirty,

and especially
some of the people

in your party are dirty.

[cheers and applause]

<i>Politicians are reticent</i>
<i>to go on Bill's show,</i>

<i>and, you know, I think</i>
<i>that maybe they should be.</i>

You know, God forbid
you say something funny

<i>or controversial.</i>

You give Street speeches?

Yes.
The--the author

of Dodd-Frank
with your name on the bill?

And I talk to them
for the same reason I'm here--

I'll be arrogant--
I'm interesting.

So people pay...

People pay to hear me talk.

So when the sea levels rise...

tammering] Obviously,
we could lose, like,

Venice.

We could lose Florida.

And who would know better
about losing Florida?


I just--I...
<i>"Real Time"</i>

<i>is totally unpredictable,</i>

and that's terrifying

to a lot of politicians.

When I told my third daughter
that I was gonna be

on your show, she, uh, said,

"Oh, my God, have you
completely lost your mind?"

Oh, come on, pal.

<i>That's just bullshit.</i>
Bill, I think you're

fading out here.
I-I'm not sure

I can hear the question.
Just wondering who

on my staff agreed
to accept this gig.


Will the next generation
of politicians

act differently
because their entire lives

will be documented on some sort

of online platform?

I think that's already--
I think we all--I mean...

Oh, look at the time.

I gotta get home.

[laughter and applause]

Taxi.
<i>There's not a time</i>

I come on here where
my political folks

are enthusiastic.

<i>Uh, they're always</i>
<i>very pessimistic</i>

<i>about the outcome.</i>

<i>I remember, actually,</i>

one time where I got there
and Bill said, "Ralph Nader

<i>"is gonna be on the show.</i>

one time where I got there
and I've got an idea."Nader

Michael and I are going
to get down on our knees

and beg you not to run.

Please.

[cheers and applause]

Please.

Please.
<i>If there's a little</i>

<i>uncertainty there...</i>

[indistinct chatter]

You know, something can happen.


I'm always telling people
who say two men

can't make a baby,
"Anything is possible for God."

Like, I'm nna ep
inseminating my husband

and keep my fingers crossed.


Maybe...

And, uh...

[speaking indistinctly]
Let's try to not make

these guys thr upin their moute

than already have.

<i>I think it's always more fun</i>
<i>having the conservative guests</i>

and having that--
that back and forth.

Uh, in fact, that's what makes,
I think, the show work.

I agree with you about labels,

but I notice you're sitting
in front of a billboard

that says "Runaway Slave."

I don't have time
to go through all of his lies.

We only have an hour.

Uh, but let's...

I can bat them all down.

Go.
I think you're a great guy.

I really hope you lose
your next election,

because I think
the world about...

I think you're colossally wrong

on a numbehings...
That's okay.

But if--exactly.

If I--if I banned everyone
from my show

who I thought was
colossally wrong,

I would be talking to myself.

<i>I think it's important--</i>
<i>especially when you think</i>

someone is dangerous--
to expose that

to as manyeoe as you can.

So giving someone like Milo
or Alex Jones, um,

or Anne Coulter a platform,

that's a public service.

You id after 9/11
what we should do

is attack Muslim countries,
kill their leaders,

and convert them
to Christianity.

Yes.
Do you still--

do you still stand by
that moderate position?

Absolutely fantastic policy.

I haven't heard a better one.
<i>I love people</i>

who stick by their guns

even when the crowd
does not agree.

I do think that there is
an element of racism

against white individuals.

I-I do.
I do see it.

I think it's been evidenced.

Well, since--
since I'm a conservative

and not a Trump person,
let me just say this:

that's absurd.

That's fucking crazy.

The pope made
a very strong statement

in support of my position
on climate change.

Not yours.

And your position,
when you heard that, was,

"Hey, let's leave the science
to the scientists."

Okay, first of all,
you're not doing that.

But second of all...
Oh--oh, I am.

You're not, because 97%
of all scientists believe...

It's a bogus number.
It's so not a bogus number.

It's so a bogus number.
Okay, yours is. Mine is.

Yours is. Mine is.

<i>This show, like none other,</i>

provides an opportunity
to articulate

deeply held beliefs,

<i>cherished ideas</i>
<i>in the face of people</i>

<i>who are radically skeptical</i>
<i>about them.</i>

[audience jeering]

ld on, Relax, liberal audience.

Let him get his bullshit out
before you boo him!


Thank you for having me
on this show

to present, uh, the other side,
but not every network

does that all the time.
This might be

the only place in the world
where we'd ever meet.

Right.

Everyone knows that
he gives people room to breathe

and he gives people
their time to talk

and make their point, um,

and he will give you your space
to do that.

But then when you look
at the Democrats,

you--you see who's up
against this guy.

This unbelievably useless,

terrible candidate

of Hillary Clinton.

I feel liberated to say
whatever I believe

and some of that is not
very popular.

I've gotten booed
several times by the audience.

<i>Bill is clearly</i>
<i>someone who's a liberal,</i>

<i>but he's not a party-line guy.</i>

You don't do your
political viewpoint,

party ideology any service

if you assume
they're always right.

Obama was against
gay marriage in 2008.

Does he have to resign?

Hillary came around
just last year.

Can she be president?

You can't purge everybody
who doesn't evolve

exactly on the timetable
you did.

remds me of the immigrant

who's been in America
for all of a year

and looks at someone
who came over last week like,

"Huh.
Boat people, am I right?"


<i>Bill picks up on things</i>

<i>that the rest</i>
<i>of the press drops.</i>

I'll be wondering,
"Why aren't people talking

abt this subject
or that subject?"

And sure enough, Bill gets it.

It'll be on his next show.

Denying racism
is the new racism.

Would you agree that there is
some sort of a medical,

pharmaceutical,
food industry complex

that are--where there's
a lot of profit

in getting us sick
and a lot of profit

in selling us pills that
don't really get us better?

[cheers and applause]

Um...
[clears throat]

It can't be the duty
of every American

to say something
if they see something,

except for the people
whose job it is

to do something.

When...

[cheers and applause]

When--when cops ask minorities

why they don't snih
on their own,

minorities have every right
to say,

"You first."

And...


After a shooting,
Bill was the first one,

I think, on air to say,

"It's not enough
to say thoughts and prayers."

I'm so sick
of all the reactions.

I'm so sick of thoughts
and prayers.

First of all...



Thoughts are the opposite
of prayers.



A thought is, "What should do?

A prayer is wishing on a star.

Thoughts and prayers are
the Republican way of saying,

"Tough shit."

Uh...
<i>You know, I-I think--</i>

I'm sure I was the first one
to call Bill

an American treasure on--
on my radio show...


And I meant it.

Uh, mostly because

the comedy is one thing,

but, um, taking on religion

is, uh, something else.

In your album, you say,
"Religion, question religion.

Question it all."Well.

You been watching me,
haven't you?

Religion is a bunch

of bullshit, and it's, uh...

That's what I wanted to hear
from you.

Good to see you, Bill.

Bill, ink,
has a slightly darker view

of all religion,
and so it's not surprising

that he has
a slightly darker view

of Islam,
and I understand that.

<i>The trouble began on the set</i>

<i>of "Realime with Bill"</i>

<i>when author Sam Harris</i>
<i>and host, Maher, suggested</i>

<i>more liberals needed</i>
<i>to speak out</i>

<i>about Muslims' freedom</i>

<i>to peacefully practice</i>
<i>religion.</i>

Islam at this moment
is the mother lode

of bad ide Jesus.

So we have--we have...
That's just a fact.

It's--it's not a fact.
It is a...

It's an ugly thing to say.

How about the more
than a billion people

who aren't fanatical,
who don't punish women,

who just want to go to school,
have some sandwiches,

five times a day,

and don't do any of the things

that you're saying
all Muslims do...

No, wait, wait, wait.
And stereotyping--

I'm not saying all Muslims--

<i>Affleck heating up</i>
<i>as the conversation</i>

<i>quickly turned</i>
<i>to a fierce debate</i>

about jihadists' role <i>in Islam,</i>

<i>the video reaching</i>
<i>over 3 million views</i>

<i>online alone.</i>

Women as equal citizens, um,

complete acceptance
of gay people,

uh, the ability to join
another religion

or have no religion.

If you are a liberal,

these are basic
human rights ideas

that you have to stand behind.

You know, most Muslims
around the world

uAmerican Muslims do
to practice the religion

any way they want,
and American liberals

should make that their cause

instead of conflating
criticizing a religion,

which is legitimate,
with bigotry,

which it is not.

We are never going
to, uh, defeat terrorism

if we don't reform Islam.
Yes.

And we are not going
to reform Islam

if we can't talk about it.

And if Muslims
can't talk about it.

Political correctness,
by and large,

narrows the argument
and locks you in

to identity politics

<i>and all sorts of things</i>
<i>you're not allowed to say</i>

<i>or think because they're</i>
<i>off the table,</i>

<i>no matter how legitimate</i>
<i>or insightful they might be.</i>

I saw a meme going around
the Internet last week

when it was
International Women's Day,

and it said,
"A woman should be...

whatever the fuck she wants."

[cheers and applause]

So...

liberals, you can applaud that,

or you can pretend

this is just a fashion trend.

You just can't do both.

There's a lot of ideas,
I think,

that were not mainstream
when we first started

to talk about them
that have become mainstream.

<i>Atheism, you know,</i>

<i>being single is no wor tha,</i>

<i>marijuana...</i>
I never met a mean pothead.

I've met a mean drunk,
a mean drug addict,

but every pothead--
even the stupid ones are nice.

I mean...
Right.

And--and I know it's supposed

to cure anxiety--
I prefer poppers, myself--

t however, if...


I know.
And it doesn't make you stupid.

Look at you.

<i>Almost no one</i>

comes out and says,

"I smoke weed," on TV,

even though God knows
how many millions

of people do every day.

Millions of Americans
are still trapped

in a no-man's-land

where a pot dispensary
can sell you weed

if you have a "card"

from a "doctor"...


Who certifies

that you have a "disease,"

which is just
"d't a, don't tell"

for pot smokers.

And...


And it creates a culture
of dishonesty

that gives a bad name
to people like me

who genuinely suffer
from whatever it is

I told them I had.

You have given it up for
about a year and a half now...

Yeah.
Uh, and, uh,

I think that's great.

When we were in, uh, Hawaii
last year, in solidarity--

I didn't want to temp you,
so I didn't do it around you

when--when we were together--
but you were one

of tneers.

And I'm not gonna try
to get you back on the wagon

at all, uh, but I just want
to show you--

no, no, I just want
to show you some pictures

to reminisce.

<i>Here's us this last year</i>
<i>in Hawaii</i>

<i>after with Jeff Ross, p pot, </i>
<i>and, you know, you look, uh...</i>

<i>you look okay but not ecstatic.</i>

<i>And, uh--</i>

<i>But here's the year before</i>
<i>when we were</i>

<i>completely baked, all right?</i>

<i>I'm just saying...</i>

<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

But, uh...
That's a strong case.

That's a...

Maybe I should, uh...

[cheers and applause]

I thought,
"Is he allowed to do this?"

You know?

"Is he gonna get arrested?"

Please remember...


Please remember

that legalizing pot is a lg wa

from a done deal.

I know you're tired--
I am too--

of making the same old
obvious pot arguments,

like how pot is less dangerous

than other legal
adult activities,

but somehow,
you can drink alcohol;

you can smoke cigarettes;

you can do that thing
where you cut off your oxygen

with a belt and masturbate...


Which is not only dangerous,
but take it from me,

it'll get you kicked out
of Macy's menswear like that.


<i>I'm not gonna see</i>
<i>Chuck Todd do that</i>

on "Meet the Press."

That's...

I mean, where are you
gonna e that?

And...

see that person back
on the air next week.

Well, that's one

of the things he criticizes
Democrats for--

that they were late to pushing

for marijuana legislation

and late to pushing harder
on gay marriage.

<i>And he was right out there.</i>

I never understand why
the gays want marriage.

I always thought the hip thing
aboubeingay

was that you couldn't
get married.


Which is why you live
more of a gay lifestyle

than I do.
Hello.


If homosexual marriage
comes flooding in,

we will all be losers.

It's going to undermine
the future civilization.

Isn't this a flood
that you can't stop

no matter how hard you try
to put your finger in the dike?


<i>He's been one</i>
<i>of the most pro-gay forces</i>

<i>in popular culture, and I think</i>

<i>he's more effective than most</i>
<i>'cause he's not</i>

<i>some simpering lefty</i>

LGBTQRS kind of guy.

Where is the Democrat

who will stand up and go beyond

the half measures
of civil union

and, "Hate the sin,
love the sinner,"

and say loud and clear,
"There is no sin"?

It's not an abomination,
and no one can control

how Cupid aims his arrows.

And the ones who pretend
they can usually turn out

to be the biggest freaks.

[cheers and applause]

Another thing
about the show is, you know,

you get a sense some people
play to an audience,

including literally
their audience.

You don't get that, uh,
on Bill's show.

I mean, he'll challenge
the aud--

I think he enjoys
challenging the audience.

You know who's superstitious
about Friday the 13th?

Republicans.

They say the country
is having bad luck

because we let a black cat

in the White House.

[audience groans]

What the fuck was wrong

with that joke?

If the audience groans

or thinks a joke is too far,

<i>he takes them on.</i>

He doesn't ignore it.
Oh, go fuck yourself.

I mean, really.

An obvious joke.

Don't start groaning.

I'll go fucking nuts
on you today.

You can see, I am right
on the edge here.

Oh, nothatas fucking funny.

What is wrong with you people?

Fuck you, with the "boo."

What is the booing?

It's gonna be rough unless
you get that stick out

of your ass right now.

My relationship
with the audience

is the relationship of my life.

Kids?

I don't have time for kids.

I've got to reite this e.


It's always where I put
my energy.

It's what I love the most.

That's my truth.

That's the way I was born.

That's what my body
is telling me to do

and always has.

It's why I've always
eated e audience

like they're my friend--
and I mean a real friend.

I trust them enough
to say things

they may not want to hear.

We don't agree on everything,
and we don't have to,

because friends don't
leave each other over that.

We even fight sometimes,

because honesty is love,

and friends don't
bullshit each other.

The night that people
heckled him--

these hecklers kept
interrupting his show...

See, this is the problem
sometimes with...

[man shouting indistinctly]

Hey, do we have
some fucking security

in this building...

Or do I have to come over

and kick this guy's ass
out of here?

Would you get the fuck out
of my building?

Hey, hey.

Hey, hey.
Out! Out!

I just remember
that he had guts, balls.

I was impressed.

This isn't towa caucus!

Okay?

It's not a debate!

It's a debate between us.

You're in the audience.

"Audience" comes from the Latin
"to listen."

[laughter and applause]

What's going on here?

<i>If you're watching,</i>
<i>you don't for one second think</i>

that anything's been altered
to get a rating

or to get anyone's approval,

and I think that's
powerful television.

Before we go on further
with this topic,

we never really got to
the presidential campaign

last week,
and Donald Trump entered,

and I just want to--
weever really discussed it,

and I have to say--
I want to ask you two,

especially,
because I hear all over

the media, "He's just a joke.

"It's just a--it's just
a publicity stunt.

Don't worry about it.
It'll go away."

It's not going away.
Yeah.

I don't think that
Donald Trump's gonna stay

at the poll--stay at the top
of theollsor very long.

I do.
I really don't think so.

He makes everybody else
look like a midget.

Not in a good way,
but you know what?

ke, here-- here's the thing

about Donald Trump.

He never apologizes.
He's never wrong.

No matter what crazy thing
he says, he's totally--

He's the white Kanye.


But isn't this just a promotion

for "Celebrity Apprentice"?

I mean, really.
No.

That's what I think!
No, no.

No, you're wrong.
<i>A lot of people,</i>

in the beginning,
either saw Trump

as just funny

and didn't see the danger,

or journalists saw him
as dangerous

and did not see the funny.

I think Bill was the first guy
to see both.

I certainly don't want
to be shitting on Donald Trump

all night.

Why not?
Oh, I'm just kidding.

Why not?
Believe me, there's plenty

more shitting to come.

Did you watch Tuesday?

Oh, he is--he is getting
a lot closer

to wrapping up the apocalypse.

I have seen this guy
change his position

from the beginning
to the end of a sentence.

Yeah.
"All I know

is what's on the Internet"?

This guy's gonna change
America's symbol

from the bald eagle
to a turtle fucking a shoe.


Where are the other Republicans
to condemn this?

When are they going to say,
"Look, I get it.

"We handcuffed ourselves
to this deadker

but at some..."

They see him as a strong
alpha man...

Yes.
Which is amazing to me,

'cause he's such
a whiny little bitch.

[all chanting]
Whiny little bitch.

Whiny little bitch.

[cheers and applause]

If there's anything scarier
than the fact

that Donald Trump thinks

he's the most important person
in the world,

it's that in eight months,
he could be.

Mm!

New rule: Donald Trump
must immediately submit

to DNA tests to determine...


[cheers and applause]

[clears throat]
To determine whether

he is, in fact, the love child

of a human woman
and an orangutan

from the Brooklyn Zoo.


<i>Donald Trump was going after</i>
<i>President Obama,</i>

<i>pretending President Obama</i>
<i>wasn't born in America--</i>

which was nonsense
and, I think, code language

to people with
racial prejudices

to tell them, "You don't
really have to honor

"the African-American
president.

It's okay.
He's not really one of us."

<i>So Bill called him on it.</i>

But given your face,
your physique,

your intelligence level,

and, of course, your hair...

The American deserve
some real proof

that your mother did not
spend most nights

in 1945

covering her body
in banana oil,

sneaking into the monkey cage,

and compulsively humping
an orange-haired ape.


Somebody had to say that.

He called me and he said,

"You know, maybe it would
make a good column for you

because Donald Trump
is suing me."

You're suing Bill Maher.
<i>Yes, and my friends</i>

<i>at "Fox and Friends"</i>
<i>have it first.</i>

<i>Yeah, I'll sue him</i>
<i>about 12:00 today.</i>

For how much?
<i>For million,</i>

<i>all going to charity.</i>

His lawyer sent me a letter.

I shit you not, this is real.


His lawyer sent me a letter
that says, and I quote...

[laughter and applause]

<i>Bill will speak truth to power.</i>

<i>He will speak truth</i>
<i>to billionaires.</i>

That's what's needed right now.

This may surprise you,
but I am not a big fan

of Rush Limbaugh.


However, if you're one
of the people with a website

devoted to making him go away,

you are part of the problem.

And, ironically,
you're not even

a proper liberal

because you don't get
free speech.

I'm telling you, this is gonna
be the death of liberals,

this nitpicky,
intramural attacking of friends

for insufficient purity,

compulsively cleaning up

a little corner theoom

that's already quite clean...


While there giant piles
of shit everywhere else.

[laughter and applause]

One of the reasons
I admire Bill

is that he says, "Screw that.

<i>"Yes, I am liberal, but I'm not</i>

<i>"politically correct.</i>

"I'm not in chains--

in the chains
of political correctness."

In a world where it's
too politically correct,

people go to some jackass

because, oh, it is a breath
of fresh air

from political correctness.

<i>Donald Trump came along--</i>

<i>and he wasn't the first,</i>
<i>but obviously,</i>

<i>he was sort of</i>
<i>the most significant--</i>

and said, "Okay,
if we currently live

"in a world where everything
is offensive,

I'm gonna create one
where nothing is."

<i>And people defended that</i>

<i>as standing athwart</i>
<i>political correctness.</i>

<i>Now, that's not</i>
<i>what he was doing,</i>

but because
political correctness

had gotten so absurd, he--

it really did allow him

to sort of jump off the cliff.

I'm sorry to have
to kind of be the--

the buzzkill here so early on,

but I think Trump is gonna win.

I-I'm sorry.
[audience booing]

You know what?
Yeah.

Boo if you want.
I am glad you're saying it.

Everybody should say that--
I don't want to say it.

No, no, the--the enemy
is complacency.

Yeah.
But you could tell

he was really raw...

and concerned,

and it's like he knew something
that no one else did.

And I didn't think
for a chance...

that his concerns
were accurate.

I'm gonna be honest with you.

I've had a couple of drinks.


I'm gonna be honest with you.

You've had more
than a couple of drinks.


I really have.

I mean, I'm shitting
in my pants

because, you know...

Let me take you back
a couple of years.

First they said--
everybody said

that Donald Trump,
when he talks about running

fopresident,
"Oh, he's just saying that."

Just saying that because
he wants to, you know,

burnish his brand
and get people

to buy his books or whatever.

Okay.

Then he announced
he was gonna run.

They said, "Well, sure,
he's a reality show star...

"and people think
that's interesting,

but he's not gonna get
any votes."

Then he got votes.

Then he-nd tn they said,
"He's not gonna win

any primaries."

Then he won primaries.

Then they said, "But he's not
gonna win the nomination."

Then he won the nomination.

And now these same people
are saying,

"He's not gonna win
the election."

Yeah, he could win
the election.

<i>This is CNN breaking news.</i>

Donald Trump will be
the 45th president

<i>of the United States.</i>

I mean...

They're gonna get rid
of Obamacare,

probably get rid
of Roe versus Wade.

So you know what?
Enjoy your victory,

Trump voters,
'cause when you're dying

because you don't have
health insurance

to treat the inftionou got
from a back-alley abortion

you had to get
'cause of fetal lead poisoning,

you can say to yourself,
"At least I didn't vote

for someone with
a private email server."

[cheers and applause]

<i>It's interesting,</i>
<i>'cause sometimes</i>

you'll watch the show
and he'll--

they'll be talking about
a particular subject

and you go...

You want everybody
to be watching this.

I ce read the list

of things that Trump does
that sound like

a third world dictator.

Uh, you put your name
on buildings.

You appoint your family members
to positions of power.

Your rallies are scary.

Yote the press and talk about

jailing reporters.

Uh, you want missile parades.

He doesn't have one,
but he wants one.

Uh, you use the ofce
for financial gain.

You love other dictators.

Does anyone agree with me
that he is not going

to leave until
he wants to leave,

including the 2020 election?

He'll probably be reelected.
52% of Republicans

would support postponing
the 2020 election

if Trump proposed it.

He takes their side
and not ours.

That's a traitor.

He calls you a lowlife.

You, who spent your life

defending this country,
especially after 9/11.

He's not on our side.

I know this is a comedy show,

and I'm gonna try
to keep it on that level,

but it's not fucking funny.

There is a slow-moving

right-wing coup...

going on.

Media, do your fucking job.

[cheers and applause]

<i>Our job is to get</i>
<i>the information out</i>

<i>as best we can, and--</i>

and start to mobilize people
to think.

And you can do it
with laughter, but you have

to do it with intelligence
behind it,

and that's what, I think,
Bill does brilliantly.

You can un-friend someone

whose politics you don't like,
but you can't un-friend

47% of America.

Roommates can move out.

Patriots can't.

America needs you
more than ever,

right here with me

and the rest
of the resistance...


[cheers and applause]

Until we can figure ou
w to really

make America great again.

And don't ever
let them forget--

we're still here.

[cheers and applause]

Humor is one
of the best vehicles

by which to deliver
the things you want say

<i>[introspective music]</i>

<i>And, sadly, too many people</i>
<i>on the left</i>

<i>have forgotten that.</i>

<i>You can have a program</i>
<i>that is as honest</i>

<i>as that one is</i>

<i>and is controversial</i>

and still be on for 15 years.

Says a lot.

Two-minute mark.
Two minutes to our show.

<i>I think it's</i>
<i>an amazing track record</i>

<i>of satire,</i>
<i>at the heart of which</i>

is deeply serious
political commentary

which has a very clear vision
about America.

And yes, it's a liberal,
progressive vision,

and--and, um...

and why not?
<i>Roll track A.</i>

Coming to the floor
in 23 seconds.

All right.
<i>That's one of</i>

<i>the great joys</i>
<i>is when people say,</i>

<i>"You say the thing</i>
<i>that's been rattling around</i>

"in brain
and I thought I was alone.

And I'm not alone."
