RADIO JOCKEY 1:
And here's one
for all the night workers

and sleep deprived
along the Lake Region.

â™ª For more than 20 years or so
still... â™ª


â™ª Don't thank me baby

THUG 1:
Come on, oh yo,
what the fuck

are you looking for?

THUG 2:
Rich chick who...

THUG 1:
What the hell is that?

THUG 2:
Did you bring cash?

I don't have any cash.

THUG 1:
In the car.

What, did she give you a list?

THUG 2:
Why do we have to buy
this girl anything anyway?

THUG 1:
It keeps her happy,
it keeps her quiet.

The less scared she is,
the less likely she'll run

and the less bullshit
we gotta deal with?

How many of those
you think we should get?

Just get her two.

THUG 2:
There's like 200 energy drinks
in here,

I don't know what to get her.

THUG 1:
Just pick one, dude,
we gotta get out of here.

THUG 2:
You ever drink this shit?

THUG 1:
Nah, don't settle with me.

THUG 2:
How about this shit?

She say something
about her lips?

THUG 1:
What's the matter with you?

Why don't you just put on
a big, bright neon sign,

so the whole store can see?

THUG 2:
You don't have to be rude
like that.

THUG 1:
Rude?

Let me tell you something,
I could give a shit

what this spoiled little bitch,
alright?

THUG 2:
Yeah, yeah.

THUG 1:
Her high maintenance's
fast as lucky

if they don't wind up
in a fucking ditch.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Thug sighs]

What's up, big boy?

Oh dude,
I got your stuff right here.

THUG 3:
Alright, thanks man.

Can you please...

THUG 3:
Got anything to warm me up
in there?

THUG 2:
Yeah.


What's that for?

Solitaire.

I don't know how to play.

Well, I don't know how to play.


What the fuck do I care
what you know to do.

You want something
to fucking do,

you can fucking do that.

THUG 2:
I could show you how to play.


[Screaming]
Oh God!

Oh my... Shit!
What the fuck.

What the fuck.

Shit man!



[Gunshot]
[Screams]

THUG 1:
You give this bitch
a full cavity search?

THUG 3:
What?

This is not
a fucking cavity search.

[Indiscernible speech]

THUG 1:
Did you check for
a fucking cellphone?


Who the fuck is out there,
man?

[Gunshot]
THUG 3: Shit.

Who the fuck is this?

THUG 3:
What the f... fuck!

Oh shit.

Somebody followed your dumbass!

Huh?

Shit, damn!

[Taking deep breaths]

Oh shit.


[Jules screaming]

Oh God!


[Gunshots]
[Screaming]

Shut the fuck up!

[Screaming & sobbing]

Who's out there?

[Jules screams]

You know what, princess,
I think I got him.

What do you think, huh?

Let's just take it easy,
you'll find out.

Come on.

[Sobbing & grunting]



I'll kill her, yo.

Huh?

THUG 1:
I said, I'll fucking kill her.

[Jules sobbing]

I don't care.

I'm not fucking with you, man.

I didn't say you were,
did I?

No.

Please, please, no.

You know what, she's loud,
kill her.

Please.

Do us both a favor.


You know, I know how to count.

You know?

And you only get six chances,
sport.


[Grunting & panting]

Did my father send you?

PRICE:
What?

Did my father send you?

Oh, your father.

Here, call him.

[Taking deep breaths]

Daddy.

Yeah. Yeah, no,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

Yeah, the um, the man you sent.

What?

What?

He said he didn't send anybody.

I know.

Good evening, sir.

I have your daughter.

And as you can hear,
she's fine.

Now I want you to get together
$200,000 in unmarked,

non-sequential
10s, 20s, and 50s.

And listen to me
just wait for the next call.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Look, I gotta talk
or I'm gonna think

and I don't wanna think about
what happened back there.

Those guys were wannabes anyway,
right?

You start shooting a 38,
you're not wanting,

you're being.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

PRICE:
Hey, is that your father?

Um, yeah.

PRICE:
He's early, an hour.

JULES:
So are you.

PRICE:
He's not alone.

There's a younger guy.
Who is it?

That's Van.

Some sort of super marine.

PRICE:
Super marine, huh?

Come on, let's go.

Mr. Lennox.

And what should I call you?

Price.

[Mr. Lennox laughs]

MR. LENNOX:
Invention, I assume.

I see you're overjoyed
to see that your daughter

is safe and sound.


How are you, Jules?

Everything alright?

I'm doing just fine.

MR. LENNOX:
Good.

Oh no, I... I don't light them.

I'm weaning myself.

You have any children,
Mr. Price?

Just your daughter.

MR. LENNOX:
Well, I thank you for that.

Your uh, mercenary tactics
mean very little to me

in comparison
to my daughter's well-being.

Morality has a sliding scale,
Mr. Price.

I like that you recognize that.

It's a good thing
to bear in mind.

Can I get some pie and a bevy?

Sure, honey.

Hey look, Mr. Lennox,
do not stall me, not me.

There's a briefcase
under the table.

Good.

MR. LENNOX:
It's all there,
just as you asked.

PRICE:
You'll understand my suspicions
if I have to verify

the uh, amount.

Hey!

MR. LENNOX:
Where are you going?

Restroom, it's nice place to...
to count.


So are you gonna make me
kill you?

VAN:
Maybe.


PRICE:
Be good.

Put your weapon, keys,
that stuff on the dash

right now.

Semper fi, mate.

Get in.

No?

What a surprise.


Oh shit.

WAITRESS:
Your check, sir.

[Birds chirping in background]


[Breathing heavily]

MAN 1:
We could potentially be
in a lot of trouble

when she goes forward.

MR. LENNOX:
Well, isn't that why
I hired you, Daniel?

The avoidance of trouble
and such.

I'm not worried about
winning this case.

That's not it.

We'll win the case eventually
no matter what.

Good.
But not before

this woman starts talking.

Don't worry about that,
it's being handled.

DANIEL:
That's what worries me.

Your idea of handled and mine
may not be the same.

As long as you cash my checks,
you don't have the luxury

of giving me lessons
in morality.

Will you excuse me a moment?

Please, keep your seat,
counselor.

Your bladder will hold, no?

What are you doing here?

Protecting our investment.

This doesn't concern me,
gentlemen.

I will not ask you again.

Our friend says,

"Take care of your business,
Martin."

He says, "Soon."

You came all the way down here
to tell me that?

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

Are we clear?

Good.

You may go take your piss now.

So how long
is this been going on?

I don't know.

You ever heard of Valerian?

No.

My son-in-law,
he's an herbalist.

Yeah, an herbalist.

You know, after my Carol passed,
he gives me this Valerian.

Now I sleep better without her
than I ever did with her.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You know, I'd hate to think
that someone was following me.

I mean, how would you react
to something like that?

How would you?


PRICE:
Drive.

[Phone ringing]

Yeah, thanks.

Yeah, who is this?


PRICE: [On phone]
Recognize those moans?

Mr. Price?

I didn't spend money finding you
to try to get even

or some such thing.

You know, I'm...
I'm sorry about the tail,

but uh, I had no other way
to get in contact with you.

Look, you know
before you kill me

or strangle me with a towel
or whatever you're gonna do,

just uh, just keep in mind
that this is a public place.

So just... just hear me out.

Okay, talk.

I really appreciate what you did
for me and my daughter.

Those degenerates probably
would've killed

the little pain-in-the-ass
whether I paid 'em or not.

At any rate, I did some
askin' around about you,

you know, I... I do business in...
in a lot different circles,

you understand.

And one of the privileges
of my position is

I get to choose the men
that I talk to.

You know, it's one of the perks
of my position.

What do you want, Mr. Lennox?

What are you going after?

There's a certain freelance gun
that dropped out of sight

a couple years ago.

Answer the question.

What do you want?

I want you to do a job for me.


I don't do that anymore,
I'm retired.

$1 million.

That's a lot of money.

Yes, it is.

[Birds chirping in background]

MR. LENNOX:
Homewood a little town
about 300 miles from here.

Timeframe?

Huh?

You need her dead, I get that.

When do you need her dead?

Oh, uh less than 10 days.

Understand when I say less than.

My situation is such

anything beyond that point
can be very...

You've decided that
you need her dead.

And that means
she's already dead.

She just doesn't know it yet.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Engine whirring]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm thinking about moving.

Where would you go?

I don't know.

I've never thought about it,

but I guess everyone always
says that, right?

"I'm going to go",
and then no one ever does.

You've said it, too,
before I mean.

A few times.


You know,
I have an uncle in Chicago,

he always says
the same thing.

"Connie, I'm telling you,
I gotta get out of this city."

10 years,
he's saying he's gonna go.


But no one ever does.

[Both laugh]

I know.


Oh shit.

What?

Rick, please not here.

Well, then where?

You tell me, I'll be there.

WOMAN 1:
You do that again,
I will call 911.

I'm not kidding.

Then what, they'll send
a couple of cops

and what are you gonna tell 'em?

That you're scared?

We're having what, a fight?

I'll make a joke,
the cops will laugh,

we'll be riving each other
about your funny, little

neurotic ways.

And when you call 911 again,

they won't feel the need
to come back.

The rest of the evening
will only be you and me.

How should I handle that?

It's over, Rick.

Is it?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Engine whirring]

[Dog barking]

Hey, baby.

I'm on my way.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Come on.

Let's go.

[Phone ringing]

Hello.

Hi, Frank.

When tom... tomorrow?

Yeah, but you're my attorney
not this Michael Donovan person.

You sure that he has to me?

The letters are safe,
I told you.

Uh-huh.

Oh, you make me nervous
when you start using

all these legal terms.

Well, I'll do what I have to do.

It's alright,
it's alright, Frank.

I just... I'm just ready
for all of it to be over,

you know.

Okay.

Alright, thank you.

Goodnight.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Can't sleep either, huh?


[Dialtone ringing]

MR. LENNOX: [On phone]
I was hoping
for the next 48 hours,

Mr. Price.

This waiting has become
somewhat uncomfortable for me.

Can we proceed?

At my own pace.

The money I am paying you,
Mr. Price, is my own,

and so should be the pace.

Am I clear?

Good.

I'll expect confirmation then,
shortly.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Indistinct chatter
& laughter in distance]

â™ª Don't let anyone tell you

â™ª [Indiscernible lyrics]

â™ª Don't let anyone tell you

RICK:
Why are you running away
from me?

Two people who love each other
gotta be able

to talk to each other.

I'm just going home, Rick, okay.

Don't touch me!

If you touch me again,
I will goddamn scream!

[Taking deep breaths]

What do you want to talk about?

I miss you.

God, please don't.

Don't... don't!

Come on!
No, no!

Stop screaming,
stop screaming!

[Muffled scream]
What are you doing?

[Shushing]
No, no!

Come on, come on!
No, don't.

No!
Come on.

I just wanna be with you.

[Screaming]
[Shushing]

Come on!
No!

Hey, come on!

[Screaming]
Come on!



[Rick panting]

No please.


Open your mouth.

Open your mouth!


Now do you believe
I'll kill you?

[Panting]
Yeah, yeah.

PRICE:
You're right.


[Taking deep breaths]

I won't go near her,
I swear to you.

I'll never go near her again.

[Taking deep breaths]
[Cocks gun]

PRICE:
That doesn't ring true.

Okay, please, please.

I don't wanna die.

Nobody does.


Uh, are you alright?

I'm sorry about uh,
whoever he is.

But he won't be botherin' you
again, okay?

Why did you do that?

Hey, um, can I...
can I take you anywhere?

My friend is inside.

PRICE:
I'm gonna go, I'll see you.

Thank you.

Damn.


MR. LENNOX:
Be three designated
call-in times,

so you can keep me posted
on your progress.

And when it comes time to uh,
transact,

it has to be an accident,
not just look like one.

I know my business, Mr. Lennox.

Accident is fine.

MR. LENNOX:
Make sure that's how
it's thought to be.

She's already dead, hmm?

PRICE:
Yeah.

It just hasn't hit
the obits yet.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

WAITER:
Hello, want a drink.

Thank you.

Maybe it was too soon for you
to come here.

I'm okay.

That's pretty much your
default response these days.

I'm okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

Look, I am.

I'm happy to be out.

You know, around people.

Just I...
I feel like such a jerk.

For ever letting Rick
anywhere near me.

I get lonely, I drop my guard.

â™ª We've all got that problem

â™ª Today

Hold on a second.

â™ª You come then you go away

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

I think I owe you a drink.

Already have one.

Why not drink it with us?

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

So what's your excuse?

For what?

PRICE:
Being here.

Answered an ad.

She's gonna be head librarian
one of these days.

Oh, really?

SARAH:
Don't pretend to be impressed.

Doesn't suit you.

And what... what do you do, Jack?

Oh, I import.

What do you import?

Toys.
Unique toys for kids.

Um, home soap-making kit,
cobbler set,

glow-in-the-dark crayons.

Italy's uh, really big
in the glow-in-the-dark arena.

[Laughs]
It's temporary, though.

The toys.

I'm saving my money

and uh, I'm figuring
on finding a place to go.

To go?

A place with strangers.

Nothing familiar.
No past, anonymity.

I knew a guy briefly who lived
in a place called "Andorra".

Near Spain.
Yeah.

Wow, most people
don't know that.

Anyway, I went there on business
to purchase some unusual pieces.

And uh, it just looked like
the kind of place that

I would like to be
some place down the line, so...

Who knows?

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

You know, I see a guy over there
who's just cute enough

to catch my interest
and drunk enough

to think likewise, so excuse me.

[Indistinct chatter & laughter
in background]

No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

PRICE:
What?

Oh.

Beat up one of your boyfriends?


Never.

You?

I never had a boyfriend.


You know what I mean.

The small talk, it's just so
uh...

Small.
[Laughs]

Yeah.

I... I guess I've always
just been um, shy.

A loner.

It's not the best selling point,
but there it is.

Me, I'm a people person.

Can't you tell?

[Both laugh]

So you often gravitate
toward Ricks?

Uh, Connie says
it's low self-esteem.

I say it's bait and switch.

Guy's on his best behavior
when you first meet him,

and then he's not really,
you know.

Look uh, you know,
there's something actually

that... that I have to do, that...
that I should've done earlier.

Um...

PRICE:
You need a lift somewhere?

Your friend uh, appears busy.

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

PRICE:
I thought
you weren't a local girl.

[Sarah laughs]

SARAH:
I'm not.

PRICE:
So where are they?

Well, they live in Nassau.

Here and Nassau.

When they're here, I...
I usually stay

in the guest house.

But uh, I guess they figured
they could be trust me,

because they left and somehow,
I graduated

to the main building.

Hello.
Must be nice in Nassau.

SARAH:
Well, lots of swimming
and sunning,

and swimming and sunning, and...

Do you like to swim?

Huh?

What was that?

Like to swim?

Oh.
[Clears throat]

Actually I... I enjoy swimming
very much, it relaxes me.

Helps you think?

Yeah.

Well, it helps me think um,
better.

[Both laugh]

Sorry.
Dave's kind of large.

[Laughs]
Yeah, I couldn't tell.

Come on, let's go.

Get in.


Wow.

Nice perk for house-sitting,
huh?

Yeah, it's great.

It's great.

To de-stress, feel free,
I love it.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Are you there?

If you're hungry,
I can make you something to eat.

[Sighs]
I gotta...

No, I'm not hungry um,
I gotta go.

Why don't...
why don't you stay for a while?

Wanna stay?


Um, I... I got a like I said,
a tough day, gotta go.

Can I call you?


I don't get a lot guests
up here,

I'm not really good at this.

I'll call you.

Give me your number.

You can call me at the library.

Okay, I'll call you.

Okay.

Thanks for the swim.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Phone ringing]

Hi, this is Sarah.

Hey, uh Sarah, it's Jack.

Jack?

Um, do I know you?

Jack?

Hi.

It's called a joke.

It's generally better
when both people laugh,

but hey, something
to look forward to, right?


Um, hey listen, I was wondering
if you wanted

to get together some time?

You know, get together
some time maybe.

Are you asking me out
on a date?


Why don't you come by the house,
um, 2:00-ish?

"Ish"?

You're not an "ish" person?

No.

But okay.


[Phone rings]

You're late.

Now we made a deal,
Mr. Price.

Where are you in this?

Getting close.

MR. LENNOX: [On phone]
Well, I'm afraid
that's not good enough.

Have you forgotten,
I'm on a timetable, Mr. Price?

Man can't do a job, should not
take that particular job.

PRICE: [On phone]
Really?

Not good enough for you,
getting close?

Too bad.

[Birds chirping in background]

[Doorbell rings]

SARAH: Hi there.
Hey.

Hi.
2:00-ish.


2:00-ish.

I'm on time.

I see, come in.

[Phone rings]

Yes.

MAN 2: [On phone]
Your time is running out.

If you cannot do this,
you know I will have to

and that will make someone
very unhappy.

I know.

MAN 2: [On phone]
He might even question
your usefulness

if you're not able to accomplish
this one little thing.

Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,

tick...


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Birds chirping]

Oh, I love it up here.

I'm more of a city girl,
so it took some time.

You know, the quiet, trees,
moths stuck in the screen door.


So here it is.

I know it looks
a little strange,

but you'll see.

So uh, stand right there.

Okay.
Okay.


I'm gonna show you
how I like to do it

and then you can try.

Alright.

Okay?

Woah.

[Both laugh]

Don't worry, I'm a pro.

That right?

Bang, bang.


Alright.


Five for five.

Can you hold that for me?
Oh.

What, you never held
a gun before?

Oh, a few times, few times.
[Overlapping speech]

The gun range,
I got a little experience.

SARAH:
First time I shot
was with my father.

We owned this land,
he loved to hunt.

He'd get all jazzed up
if he can go out

and come back with
some kind of a carcass.

I never really liked it though.

So when I was like 13,
he took me and my sister

to this bird sanctuary we had.

You know, the wooden cabins
with the bird feeders inside.

So we were in there
and he gave me this gun.

Think it was a little 22.

And he told me,
he wanted me to kill

one of the birds.

I loved these birds.

What'd you do?

I did what any
self-respecting 13 year-old girl

would do.

I started crying.

He was mad at me at first.

Think he wanted me to be
more like him.

You know, share in this
odd fascination he had

with killing
defenseless animals.

[Birds chirping in distance]

SARAH:
Okay, I'm ready for ya.

Ready?

It's a little late for dinner,
don't you think?

I mean it smells good, though.


I like to cook at night.

It's an old habit.

Freeze it all and have a week
of microwave dinners.

Yeah?

Yeah.

I'm a world-class insomniac.

It's my confession to you.

I go to the store.

Hmm?
At night when I can't sleep,

I go to the store.

I don't buy much maybe uh,
milk, gum.

You know, night comes
and I get itchy.

Like you were saying, I guess.

What if the store's closed?


How are you with a knife?

Better than you are with a gun?

Oh, I get it.

I can... I can do that.

Thanks.

[Sarah muffled screaming]



I'm okay.



[Taking deep breaths]

Get up.

Really?


[Yelling & grunting]

Shut up!

Shut up.

What's your name?

[Taking deep breaths]

I'm gonna ask you one more time.

What's your name?
Decatur.

Decatur, who hired you?

Lennox sent me.

[Taking deep breaths]

[Door slams shut]

[Price grunts]

It's okay now.

I don't think I like
being saved much.

Second time, makes me feel,
I don't know.

He didn't hurt you, did he?

I'm okay.

My... my dog.

My dog is gone.

He usually comes back.

He's gonna come back, right?

PRICE:
You want a glass of water?
I'll gonna get you water.

No, I... no, I don't want
any water,

I just want you to sit with me.

Could you sit with me, please?

Just sit with me!

Sure.


I'm gonna...

We should... we should call
the police, right?

No.

I'll do that in a bit.

They're gonna wanna ask
questions, take statements.


PRICE:
Not always.

This is not new territory
for me.

Police, interrogations,
bullshit.

I've seen more
than I want to remember.


I look at you, and I think,
"You've seen too much, too."

Oh, I'm fine.


My share, whatever.

We don't get a share, Jack.

Not if we're lucky.

I was 11 years old
when I saw my mother murdered.


It wasn't until I was older
that I was able to admit it

to myself and go through
something like that.

Mom had all the money,
my dad wanted it.

So he killed her.

Take that water now.

I tried to pretend that
none of it ever happened,

hoping it would just go away,
but it didn't.

So I ran.

And after years of running,
nothing changed.

I figured why not turn around
and run straight at it.

I went to the D.A.
and told him what I saw.

So um, what'd you see?

This man coming out
of their bedroom.

His face, his cheek
like it'd been ripped

in a fight.

And there was letter by the bed,
my mother had written me

that she was leaving my father.

That I shouldn't blame myself.

That she loved me.

And then I walked
to the bathroom,

and there was my mother,
hanging.

I'm sorry.

Um...

Police did their own
stupid investigation,

put my father in front
of a grand jury.

Said it was a suicide.

And that was my letter,

and I was afraid to share it
with anybody.

I was young,
I didn't understand.

The new hearing is next week.

I'm the only witness.

Sarah...

You're a very strong person.

No, I'm a wreck.

[Sarah sighs]

Hey, you should...
you should maybe get some rest.

Price, don't leave.

No, I'm...

Please don't leave.

Hey.

No, no, I'm not leaving.

I'll... I'll be right here.

Come on.

Right here.


I swim.

Hmm?

Um, before you asked me
what I did when I can't sleep.

I go to the lake
and it's just me and the moon,

and um...

...all the quiet in the world.

And uh, I swim.

I like that.


[Birds chirping in distance]

PRICE:
Hey, Sarah.

I'm sorry,
I was trying to be quiet.

I'm just... I'm going to work.

What's wrong, you okay?

You know, keeping a routine
is my only saving grace, so um,

You're welcome to stay.

And I'm gonna be coming back
after lunch.

Are you gonna be here later?

No, not here.


We gotta stay together now.

You understand?

We gotta.

But this house is a bad idea,
believe me.

Okay?

Here's my cell.

Alright.

Okay, okay.

Great, thank you.

Thank you, bye-bye.

[Phone rings]

Hello, can you hold
one moment please.

Hi.

Hi, where can I find
the electronics section?

Um, enter the elevator,
so right... it's left now.

Hello, Homewood Public Library,
Help Desk.

[Indistinct speech]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Elevator dings]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

We need to talk.

SARAH:
No, we don't.

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

JULES:
Either way, I'm going to talk,

so I'm guessing
you won't want to do it here.

[Price sighs]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Honks horn]

Get in.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey.

I came by earlier
looking for you.

20 minutes earlier
before I found you.

I... I was in one of the offices.

In a meeting.

With who?

What?
PRICE: Your meeting.

With who?

Hmm?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Why in the hell
are you following me?


You got it backwards, darling.

You followed me.


She's my sister.

Your...

My younger sister.

We have different mothers.

She came by to warn me.

Talking to your sister
wasn't a good idea.


I don't listen to the help.


The man that killed your mother,
your father,

that's her father?

Yeah, that's what I just said.

Why are you...
Jesus!

You say she came here
to warn you?

Jesus, Jack,
you're scaring me.

The last time you spoke to her?

A long time.

How long?

Years, years, 10 years,
I don't know!

She stayed back with my father,
alright, for the security,

the money.

Why do you wanna know?

Why are you asking about her?

[Sighs]
Talk to me, Jack.

Tell me what's going on.

Go get your things.

Pack your bags,
get on the road.

Okay.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

No!


No!

Oh my God!


Oh my God!

No.

No!


[Shushing]
Oh God!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Grunts]
[Sarah gasps]

[Tires screeching]

What the hell are you doing?

[Honks horn]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Stay here.

If anything happens to me,
leave.


[Birds chirping in distance]


[Birds chirping in distance]

[Sarah honking horn]


Semper Fi, Mac.

[Fires gunshot]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Here, um, uh, Sarah here.

I thought you might want this
I uh, I took it before.

I figured you'd might wanna
have it as a keepsake.

Look at her.

The sweet face she had.

Yeah, who's the guy?

SARAH:
That's my dad.

PRICE:
Hang on, this is your father?

SARAH:
Uh-huh.

Hmm.

Yeah, that's our father.

Who'd you think it was?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Well, aren't you going
to kill me?

That's why you're here,
isn't it?

Small part of me
didn't even mind.

Being tired will do that
to you,

make you wish
for it all to stop.

No, Sarah.

I'm not gonna kill you, okay?

I wasn't completely sure
about that

until that night.

You held me like...

Like it was more than comfort
for you.

For the first time
in a long time,

I didn't feel so alone.


SARAH:
I can't keep running,

can't keep pretending that
none of this ever happened.

My mother, Jules, my life.

Someone has to be responsible.


Someone is.

You and I can do this.

And there's no other way.

I want to.

I want him to die.

To pay for killing my mother,
for killing me,

who I might've been.

He killed that person.

And the law, and the police,
and all this bullshit...


I imagined would somehow b...
bring me deliverance.

Means nothing.

I want him to die.

Okay.

I'll kill him.

But do you understand
what you're saying?

You have to.

You may be just
trading in devils.

Him for me.

I kill people, Sarah, okay?

I kill people for a living.

And I was hired to kill you.

But you didn't.

No.

And then...

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[Country song on radio]

[Indiscernible lyrics]

[Knocking on door]

Oh, fuck.

Yeah, who is it?

SARAH:
More towels, Mr. Lennox.

Oh shit.

How many fucking towels
does one man need?

Do you know who I am?

Oh my God.


And me, I'm sure you remember.

So what do you want?

You want the rest
of your money?

PRICE:
This isn't about money anymore.

Oh, come on,
it's always about money.

You're smarter than that.

We haven't actually met.

I'm Sarah.

Yeah, I know who you are.

What do we call you?

Let... look, I'm not interested
in playing your games.

Get interested.

Okay.

You value your life, then get
Martin Lennox on the phone.

Now exactly what would my life
be worth if I were to do

something like that?

Well, that's a question
of degrees.

How so?

I can kill you fast.

I can kill you real slow.

Either way,
inside of this room

last thing
you're ever gonna see.

Well, you got a cellphone?

He's more likely to take
a call from you.

Hurry.

Mr. Lennox?

Yes, yes, I know.

But... but this is urgent, I...

Hello, father.

Yes, I'm surprised to hear
your voice, too.

I don't think so.

Here's what I'm offering.

I'll drop the case
and hand you the evidence,

but first, you pay Mr. Price
the remainder of his fee,

plus $1 million.

I'll call you with
an exact location in 45 minutes.

And dad, come alone.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's been a long time.

Long time, since I've seen him.

When he gets here,
tell me the number of people

in the vehicle, okay?

I'll be right there.

Driver, can't see the back seat.

[Gunshot]
[Grunts]

PRICE:
Come here.

Move.

Let's go!

She say, "â€œCome alone."â€

Let me see your hands!

You're kidding.

Okay?

PRICE:
Okay.

Good Lord, Sarah,
let me see you.

Stop!

You can look from there, dad.


A lot of years.

Lot of years.

You wanna tell me the story
with the other guy?

MARTIN:
Other guy?

The other Martin.

Oh.


You never knew me to be
a social kind of fellow.

That... that was his job,
the small stuff.

Man in my position can afford
to distance himself.

That's the joy of it, really,
wouldn't you say?

Now may I ask you a question?

Okay.

You waited 20-odd years
for this.


That's a long to time
to harbor anything.

What in heaven's name
possessed you

to come forward now?

Sleep.

Sleep?

I haven't had a really
good night's sleep

since I was 11 years old.

Those images,
they never left me.

Maybe now they will.

She was lovely, you know,
your mother.

But there just wasn't
any other way.

In business, you often have to
do more, go further, be bold

in ways which you might
never have imagined.

It's that very boldness
that has provided me this life.

I'd like to think that I passed
that boldness along to you.

Maybe you did.

MARTIN:
Good.

All I ask is that you,
at least, try to think about it

from my side, Sarah.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's yours now.

Wait till I get back to the car,
then you can take it,

put the bag in its place.

You know, for most people,
doing what you did,

living would be worse
than dying.


For most people?

Perhaps.

Consider this a favor.




[Birds cawing in distance]

We're good?

You and me?

[Engine starts]
