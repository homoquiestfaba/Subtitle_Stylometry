From New York,
the greatest city in the world,

it's the Late Show with David Letterman.

Tonight, from <i>House</i>, Hugh Laurie.

From <i>Cupid</i>, Sarah Paulson.

And musical group Bloc Party.

Plus Paul Shaffer, and the CBS Orchestra.

And now, fresh from
his Turks and Caicos wedding,

David Letterman!

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Thank you.

By the way, spring in New York City,
feels nice, doesn't it?

Here now is the sure sign
that it's spring in New York City:

Earlier today, Regis opened
the windows on his apartment,

and aired out his money!

Beautiful day in New York City today.

So nice, the AIG executives
were counting their bonuses in the park!

So sunny, Yankees third baseman
Alex Rodriguez

came out of a whorehouse squinting!

Here's a story that just
keeps getting better and better.

Alex Rodriguez apparently
goes to the same whorehouse

that former New York Governor
Eliot Spitzer used to go to.

Listen to this: Alex's cousin is
the guy who supplied the Viagra.

Alex Rodriguez and prostitutes,
and, I don't know why,

but Kobe Bryant's wife ended up
with a diamond ring.

I don't understand.

You folks like celebrity birthdays?

Who doesn't?

I got one for you.
Happy birthday to Rosie O'Donnell.

Rosie O'Donnell.

Rosie O'Donnell, 47 years old,
and happy birthday to Rosie O'Donnell,

but I'm telling you something.
I'm beginning to wonder,

starting to worry a little at 47.

Is she ever gonna find the right guy.

I don't know.

Here's some exciting news.
You know Bruce Willis?

Our good friend, fine actor Bruce Willis?

Over the weekend, Bruce--
by the way, is 54 years old--

got married to a former Victoria's Secret
supermodel by the name of...

I know her last name is Heming.

Henning or Heming?

Heming is her last name.

Henning or Heming?

Heming with an M?

With an M.

Thank you.

I have no idea why you're applauding,
but it makes me feel good.

We wanted you to feel better.

They're applauding ineptitude.

Apparently.

Anyway, the woman is beautiful.
30 years old.

Bruce is 54, his wife 30 years old.

Congratulations, but...

Doctors said, "Be careful on
the honeymoon. You could die hard."

That certainly was worth the trouble,
wasn't it?

It's the cough again.

You know about this weasel,
this rodent Bernie Madoff?

Who's in prison now for 150 years,
because he swindled billions?

50, 60 billions
from old people and charities?

This guy swindled 65 billion, and they
sentenced him to 150 years in prison,

but somehow, it's not satisfying, is it?

It's not satisfying.
150 years prison, and, you know,

when he comes out, they think
the recession will be better, but...

And I got a call from Roger Goodell
at the NFL earlier today,

and he said, "You know,
here's what we're trying to do

for halftime at the Superbowl next year.

We'll get that Bernie Madoff out there,
and we'll let victims come down there,

and they'll bring hefty bags
full of their own urine,

and we'll put him right there at
the 50-yard line, and people can line up..."

Poof him with the...

Poof him with the big bags.

And I said, "Why are you calling me?"

But anyway, now-- No, wait a minute.

It turns out now that Bernie Madoff's
accountant was also arrested.

This guy's also arrested. Yeah, what a pair.

Bernie and his accountant.
And you know what else?

They were planning to put together
a musical about the life of Adolf Hitler.

These guys.

Wow.

Yeah, Bernie's in prison right now,
and at this very minute,

he's tapping out stock tips on the plumbing.

How does Bruce Willis' wife
spell her last name?

Does anybody know?

With an M?
With an M.

Yeah, fine. Thank you.

Bernie, though, wants to
be a model prisoner today.

He was teaching his Ponzi class.

I want to tell you something,
ladies and gentlemen.

Maybe you noticed this already.
If I seem in a bad mood tonight,

it's because CBS just
declared me a toxic asset.

That's right.

The Obama administration.
Are you aware of this now?

They wanna unload
a trillion dollars in toxic assets.

I don't know what that means. A trillion--

But do you know how much
a trillion dollars is?

A trillion dollars,
you put them all together,

that's almost as much as the AIG bonuses.

A trillion dollars, just about...

Please.

Do you folks have March Madness?

Do you-- Feeling a little March Madness?

And you know, this weekend now,

the teams are all focused on
getting to the Sweet Sixteen.

It's the same goal as Octomom.

Really?

Octomom.

By the way, did you read about this?

Octomom says she will never reveal
the identity of the octuplets' father.

Never reveal the identity of the guy
who is the father of the octuplets, Octodad.

Will never reveal...

And I thought, well, at least
she can keep her mouth shut.

Wait a minute.

Who said that?

Who said that?

Anybody see the president
last night on <i>60 Minutes</i>?

And, he's getting a little loopy,
and who can blame him?

Because when the guy
came into office, first of all,

the campaign to become president,

I mean, that lasted seven, eight years.

And then he becomes president,
doesn't really get time off,

and he's gotta sit through that parade
on inauguration day,

and that lasted another three, four hours.

And so he's exhausted,
and he's loopy so on <i>60 Minutes</i> last night,

he was a little bit giddy,
and people are now saying,

"Now, wait a minute. Is this guy--"

First of all, I wouldn't give
this guy's troubles to...

a monkey on a rock.
A monkey on a rock.

But people are saying,
"Is he taking things seriously?"

Well, here. Take a look.

Oh, no. There's gotta be a little
gallows humor through the day.

You know, sometimes my
team talks about the fact

that if you had said to us a year ago..."

Got a thing... Did you see it? Is he...

Yeah, I don't know.

And now, here's the example
of political nitpicking.

Because nobody really knew how
to criticize what the president is doing.

Because first of all,
the task ahead of him is impossible.

And, you know,
he's at least out there trying.

So what really can you say wrong?

Listen to this. Critics are now criticizing
his overuse of the teleprompter.

Okay, maybe he should
think about stepping down.

Overuse of the teleprompter.
So we put together a piece here tonight.

It's entitled
"Teleprompter vs. No Teleprompter."

Take a look.

This was the time when we performed.

In the words that are
carved into this very chamber.

"Something worthy to be remembered."

I mean...

Tell people why I say... I mean is it...

This has been
"Teleprompter vs. No Teleprompter."

That's exactly what I'm talking about.

There, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Shaffer.

Say hello to my buddy Paul.

Thank you, David.
It's exactly what I'm talking about.

A two, three.

Oh, what a show.
We'll be right back with Hugh Laurie.

Coming up after the break, Hugh Laurie.

I don't know if you remember
last fall during football season.

We're all excited about
the Ball State fighting football Cardinals.

Because they had an undefeated record
during the regular season,

and they did not win their conference,
but came very close.

And then they went to some Bowl,
and then they got beat in the Bowl,

and they're coach left.

And what's turned out to be a--
started out to be a happy, lovely story,

turned out to be rather ugly, frankly.

Well, listen to this. Ball State
women's basketball, talk about a program,

knocked off Tennessee 71-55,
and they're going to the NCAA final weekend.

The fighting Lady Cardinals.

So congratulations,
and hats off, and way to go.

And my other tourney pick,
I predicted Butler would go all the way,

and meet Louisville in the final.

Butler was defeated in the first game.

But we have a guy here
in a Hoosiers sweatshirt.

Does that mean anything to anybody? No.

Now here's a book, ladies and gentlemen.

It won't solve all your problems,
but once you solve this problem,

you'll be able to take care of
the rest of the problems in your life.

And that's weight loss. Have you
ever tried to lose any weight?

It's impossible. I'll tell you what
I tried a couple of weeks ago.

Pancakes. You ever tried pancakes?

I mean, call the cops,
because you have them,

and you put a little butter,
and a little syrup on them,

and you have a stack of like a dozen...

Well, that's the problem.
But we got a guy on.

Our good friend, the man who saved my life,

Dr. Lou Aronne wrote this book,
and in a minute, he's gonna come out here,

and make him feel at home, because he's got

a nice bright, white, crisp lab coat on.

And he couldn't look cuter.

And he gonna come out,
we're gonna talk about the book,

then George Clarke,
our building engineer, is on this program,

and Lou started him on the program
two weeks ago on this very show,

and we're gonna find out
how much weight George has lost.

George was 257. But now Dr. Lou,
the author of this book,

put him on the Dr. Lou regimen, and
we'll just see in a couple of minutes here,

how George Clarke did
in the last couple of weeks.

It's impossible,
as you know, to lose weight.

But Dr. Lou, and wait 'til you
get a look at the lab coat.

Now here we go. Get ready.

Because this is something
you're gonna tell your kids about.

On Saturday, March 21, 2009, on
Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands,

Bruce Willis was married to
British model Emma Heming with an M.

They've been dating for just over a year,

and they plan to have a civil ceremony
when they return to California.

So congratulations,
and we couldn't be happier for Bruce.

Okay, that was Saturday on Parrot Cay
in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Now, on Thursday, at 3 p.m., March 19, 2009

at the Teton County Courthouse
in Choteau, Montana,

I was married to Regina Lasko.

He's not kidding! He did it!

Congratulations!
Congratulations! You did it!

All right, now.

He finally did it!

Finally did it.

Now let me give you
the tale of the tape on this. We--

Regina and I began-- All right!

It's a little bit of a surprise.

We, Regina and I began dating February 1986.

That's what I mean. That's what I mean.

And I said, "Well, things are
going pretty good. Let's just...

see what happens in about ten years."

We have a five-and-a-half year old
son named Harry.

Yes, you do.

Justice of the Peace John L. "Pete" Howard
performed the civil service.

So, there you go.
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.

That is beautiful. Congratulations.

And people say, "Jeez, Dave.
You were together so long,

does it feel any different?"

And I say, "Yeah."

Yes, it... It does.

Oh, my God. So what
a big weekend that was for me.

And I don't know what else
to tell you, but here we go.

Please.

They say, "Well, why did it take
you so long to get married?"

And, of course, the answer honestly is,

we wanted to make sure
we had the prenup just right.

It's too late for that.

So what do we got here?
Bernie Madoff is in prison,

and people have been wondering
how he spent his time under house arrest.

Oh, my God. That's right.
Before he went to prison,

they had him locked up
in his penthouse apartment.

Well, we have some rare footage

of Bernie and his lovely wife Ruth at home
during those months of house arrest.

Watch this.

How can I help you?

Package for Madoff. Sign here.

Have a nice day.

Yeah, you too.

I just love being an ass--

Okay. We'll be right back with
Dr. Lou Aronne, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you. Beautiful, Felicia.

Thank you.

And I avoided getting married
pretty good for like 23 years.

And I honestly,
whether this happened or not,

I secretly felt that men
who were married admired me.

You know? Like I was...

Like I was the last of the real
gun slingers. You know what I'm saying?

So now, we get ready to go, and we
gotta drive into the courthouse,

and it's muddy.
And we're supposed to be there at 2.

So it's me, Regina and Harry
in the truck. In the pickup truck.

I know Bruce Willis is saying,
"What, it's like I have a twin."

So we get two miles from the house,
and we get stuck in the mud.

I mean "turn the truck over"
stuck in the mud.

Oh, no.

So now, we think,
"Well, somebody will come..."

No. Nobody comes along. Nobody comes along.

It's Thursday afternoon. Who's coming along?

Zorro? No. Nobody.

So I get out of the truck, and I walk
two miles back to the house.

Into a fifty-mile-an-hour wind.

It's not Beverly Hills.
It's Montana for God's sakes.

Wow.
And the whole way

I'm thinking, "See, smart ass?"

See? You try and get married,
this is what happens? See?

Well you got nobody to blame but yourself.

Could've happened any other day,
but you wait now.

See? This is what you get."

So then we get in the car, and Harry says,
"Are we still going into town?"

And I said, "Yes we are."
And he gets very upset.

Because Mom had told him if I wasn't back
in an hour, the deal was off.

Oh, no. We're going into town!
We're going to town!

Sit back there and be quiet!
Oh, no! We're going to town!

Here, ladies and gentlemen.
I talked about this earlier,

and we're gonna have the weight-in.

George Clarke, two weeks ago--
Now we'll see what he did.

I don't know what's going on back there.

So not just George, his family, his health,

but the career of this man right here,
Dr. Lou Aronne, are in the balance.

Raise the thing, and let's go back there,
ladies and gentlemen,

and see what's happening. Here we go.

Hello. How are you?
How're you doing?

Congratulations.

What do you think? Huh? What did I tell you?

George, how're you doing?

Good, sir.

How long you been on the diet
here with Dr. Lou?

Little over two weeks.

Two weeks, and you're a guy
who really liked to eat before,

and would eat with abandon.
Is that accurate?

Correct, sir.

And so now, it's kind of a radical change.

Was it so radical for you,
making this change?

It was tough for the first three days.

Did you feel yourself kinda
a little lightheaded?

A little weak in the knees?

Yes.

What would you do when you
got lightheaded, and weak in the knees?

Well, Dr. Lou told me
to have some chicken broth.

Chicken broth? Good. Good.

And am I correct? You're trying
to lose weight off your knees?

Is that what it is?

And again, this is an
exact replication of Lou's office.

So if you see him...

Same thing.
Same thing.

All right. This book, by the way,
will be in stores tomorrow.

Is that correct?
That's correct.

And it's going to be-- I'm telling you--
will be an instant best-seller.

But you know, George.
It's not just you and your welfare,

and the health, and concern of your family,

but Lou has put his life on the line, here.

I know.
Okay.

So last week, how much was it?
Two weeks ago, it was what?

257.
257.

What would you expect
in two weeks on this procedure?

I think he could probably lose ten pounds.

Ten pounds. All right. Okay. You ready?

Hop right up there.

What is that? 12 pounds?
11 pounds.

11 pounds. 11 pounds. Congratulations.

Thank you, boss.
Wow.

Lou, you want to get on the scales?

Oh, no.

Well, this is the... How long
is he gonna be on the thing.

For weeks.

And what is your target weight?

About, what? 210?

We think if he could lose
20, 30, you said 40 pounds?

I think he'd feel great.

We want to get his waist down
to less than 40 inches. That's our goal.

What is his waist now?

His waist right now-- He started at 49.
He's down significantly low.

He's lost three inches from his waist.

Three inches off his waist,
ladies and gentlemen.

There it is. <i>The Skinny on
Losing Weight Without Being Hungry</i>.

Nice job, Dr. Lou.
We'll see you soon. Nice job, Lou.

We'll be right back with Hugh Laurie,
ladies and gentlemen.

Our first guest tonight stars as
the voice of Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.

in the new animated film entitled
<i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>. It opens Friday.

Please welcome the very talented
Hugh Laurie, ladies and gentlemen.

How you doing?
I'm doing very well, thank you.

Good to have you with us again.
Thank you for being here.

It's very good to be here.

Do you remember-- And, of course,
I'm sure you're in New York City frequently.

Work and so forth, travel back and forth?

No. I would say, no. I come here
in my dreams obviously all the time.

Really?
But in reality, less often.

What was it like the first time?

Remember your first time?
My first time was...

Yes, the first time I came
was when we shot <i>Stuart Little</i>.

I was in a film called <i>Stuart Little</i>.

We shot for a couple of months
in New York which I absolutely adored.

I actually spent two months
living at the Plaza Hotel.

Well, very good for you.
I was like a little Elouise.

Although, I actually did-- That was
not my intention when I came.

An American friend of mine recommended
a very, sort of, British hotel that...

It certainly was very British.
It was that kind of Britishness

that all you lot left Britain
to come to America for.

It was absolutely a miserable hotel.

Oh, sure.
And it felt like someone had died

in the room about an hour before I moved in.

And I thought to myself, "I cannot
stay in this place. I have to leave."

But it was about midnight so
I can't go traipsing around the city.

So I went downstairs,
and I hailed a cab. I thought,

"I'll have just one night at the Plaza,
and then I'll find somewhere tomorrow."

And I hailed a cab,
and I said, "The Plaza Hotel."

And the guy said, "What are you nuts?"

And I said, "No--" Well, "Hello."

"Do you want to go to the Plaza?"

And I said,
"Yes. It's a good hotel, isn't it?"

"The Plaza Hotel is a very good hotel.
It ranks amongst the finest."

"Well then take me thither,
young man, with all due speed."

So he then drove his cab about 12 feet.

There you go.
I could've...

I could've gone in one side, and out
the other. Would've been just as good.

So then, of course, I had to make up
a story about how I had a bad back.

I see.
And that's why I couldn't lift my case.

You're lucky he didn't take
you to LaGuardia and back.

All right, there it is.
That'll be 80 dollars, thank you.

But speaking of things English,
you received one of these--

And I don't know how often they're
giving out these knighthoods, or...

What are they, BSEs or BOEs or...

It's called an OBE. It's like a very,
very junior knighthood.

It's like the first part of your kit
on your way to getting a knighthood.

And the initials...

So they're like action figures
you have to collect.

It's a sort of... I'm technically an
Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

Well, very impressive.

Again, that would be something
you all came here to avoid.

And how do you know about this? Are you...

You campaigned for it?

No. No, I don't think so.

No, I just... It arrives in the...
In fact, they ask you,

if you were to be offered,
would you accept it.

And there were very, sort of,
mixed feelings in Britain.

Some people think it's a vestige
of an antiquated imperial system.

Why would they think that?

And others think that,
you know, it's just a...

I actually asked my son--
My was 16 at the time.

I said, "Do you think I should take--
Is it a good thing or not?"

He said, "You'd have to be so
up yourself not to take this."

So, I...
There you go. From a 16-year-old.

That was a very healthy response.

But it's interesting to me that they
mention in the congratulations,

"You've been awarded the OBE.
Are you interested?"

It just seems like, well,
if you're worthy to be awarded,

it doesn't make any difference
whether you're interested or not,

you get it.
You take it.

You take it and be grateful.
You'd think, wouldn't you?

I suppose they just don't want
a lot of "Nah, thanks. I won't..."

They're trying to avoid that.

You think they do get that?

I don't know, actually.
Because they... It's possible.

It's possible. But I took it,
and I went along, and I...

And there's the big thing,
and the Queen is there.

Big thing with the trumpets, and...

Sure.
Tailcoats, and...

And I met the Queen for
about four to five seconds,

and she, sort of, completely glazed over.
I could've said absolutely anything.

I could've propositioned her,
and she probably wouldn't even notice.

Well, that's how you
get your award right there.

But do you... Who else was
in your class of inductees?

Well, this is the slightly trying thing.

The people-- There were two guys
before me who were--

And they read out the merits
of their award before they get it.

And these two guys were up
before me, and it was for

defusing a bomb while
under severe enemy gunfire.

You know, Corporal so-and-so,
and Sergeant so-and-so,

and they get their medal.

And then the next up,
for services to the entertainment industry.

It's just...

Ouch.
It's really...

We each serve in our own way, don't we?

We answer the call.

Let's see. <i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>,
and you're Dr. Cockroach.

Have you done...

This movie's gotta be a hit
if your character gets a laugh.

Dr. Cockroach, people seem to like.

That seemed to go well so far.

Have you done much...
Cockroaches? I haven't.

Animation. So, voiceover.

I've done some in Britain, but this is
the first time doing a big American one.

And it was... I mean, the cockroach is...

It's a troubling thing to be offered this,

because you have no way of knowing
whether they had a cockroach,

and thought, "Now who do
we get to play-- Oh, I know.

It's that guy..." Or whether they
wanted me in the film, and they said,

"Well, what's he gonna play?
Oh, I know. A cockroach."

You can't win either way.
Neither one is good.

Let's... This thing--
The movie opens Friday.

And let's show a clip here, Hugh.
What are we gonna see?

We are going to see... Reese Witherspoon
plays a 49-foot-tall woman.

Now, do you get... Wow.

49-foot-tall woman.

Somebody would have to put you up to it.

Wait a minute.

Let's take a look. It's Hugh Laurie as
Dr. Cockroach in <i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>.

Throw the switch, Doctor.

But don't do the laugh.

Now, you're going to feel
a slight pinch in the brain.

Sorry.

Susan! Yoo-hoo!
Am I small again?

I'm afraid not, my dear.

In fact, you may actually
have grown a couple of feet.

Dr. Cockroach.

Very impressive.

I wouldn't be surprised
if you get another award.

You think?
Yes, I think so.

The film opens on Friday,
<i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>.

And then, also, we didn't even
mention the show, of course.

How long have you been doing that?

It's coming to the end of our fifth season.

Oh, good for you.

Hugh Laurie, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

Good to see you. Thank you very much, sir.

We'll be right back
with Sarah Paulson, everybody.

Be sure to tune in to tomorrow's Late Show.

David is joined by Mary Tyler Moore,
<i>Gossip Girl</i>'s Blake Lively,

and musical guest White Lies.

Our next guest stars on
the new television series

<i>Cupid</i>, which premieres March 31.

Please welcome the lovely
Sarah Paulson, ladies and gentlemen.

How are you doing?

I'm a little nervous.

Are you nervous? I'm sorry to hear that.

What about? Why are you nervous.

I'm afraid that I'm gonna have a stroke.

Like literally.
I can't feel my fingers or my feet.

You know we have Dr. Lou here.

I might... I might actually...
I need his services.

Do you have-- Do you suffer hypertension?

In my mind, I do.

I really...

You're a hypochondriac.

Incredible hypochondriacal.

We're kindred spirits.
I also am a hypochondriac.

I do. I'm always worried
I'm about to have a stroke.

You know? You sort of feel like
tasting pennies in your mouth?

Now have you ever actual--
Any actual serious illnesses or disorders?

No, just imagined.
Just imagined, yeah.

See, I used to be a really,
really inveterate,

enthusiastic hypochondriac.

And then I had open-heart surgery.

That pretty much knocks it right out of you.

When you finally have something
like that, everything goes away.

Does this manifest itself regularly?

Yeah. I would say I was
a bit of a nervous person.

Yes, it's not good. I mean
I'm sort of seeing spots right now.

Really?
There's one there.

And one there.
Wow.

Boy, this sounds awful.

When are you at ease in your life?

Never.
Really?

Yeah, it's bad. It's really, really bad.

You wanna feel my hand a little more?

That's very-- That's wet, right?

Yes it is.

Yes it is.

Can I drink this? 'Cos my tongue's
sticking to the roof my mouth.

Thanks so much.

And what will--
And I don't want to dwell on this,

but what kind of a situation
will make this condition worse?

I guess being on a TV show
is probably not ideal for you.

No, that actually...
I can sort of... That I can do.

It's bizarre. Getting on an airplane
is not good for me.

Yeah, I get a little nervous about that.

Especially when-- I have this ritual where
I like to talk to the pilots before I fly.

And just a sort of going in the cockpit
and check everything out.

Make sure it looks good to me.
Since, you know,

I know a lot about what all those gadgets
are supposed to look like.

But I think that they tend to, sort of,

mistake my anxiety
for some sort of flirting.

So, inevitably,
I will get a box of chocolates,

or a drink sent to wherever I'm sitting,
or a note that sort of says,

"Hey, if you wanna talk more about
your anxiety, you can call me at..."

And it's very bizarre,
and I just sort of think,

"Hey, sir, really. Do me a favor.
Don't be writing down little notes,

and sending them to, like, 3C or 39D,

because I need you to focus
on the task at hand."

Fly the machine.
That's right.

Have you taken any of these classes
where they help, sort of,

ease your fear, your anxiety about flying?

No, because I'm quite
attached to my anxiety.

I'm afraid that it's my anxiety
that's actually keeping the plane aloft.

Which is like...

Wow, this just gets stranger and stranger.

So this is multifaceted, isn't it?

Oh, yeah.

I mean, you're not kidding around.
You're not a beginner.

Well, I'm glad you're... I hope you
didn't have a tough trip coming in.

You came in from California?

I didn't come in from California,
but I do often fly back and forth,

'cos I just moved back to New York,

and it does cause me to be on
the plane more than I'd like to be.

See, I would like to talk to you about this,
but I don't want to be misinterpreted,

especially now that I'm married.

Because I think I can help a little.
I don't know that I can help completely.

Okay. I'd love to know.

But, you've also done theater
here in New York?

I have done a theater in New York.
Yes, I just said, a theater.

That happens also when you're nervous.

Well, that's all right.

You say "a", when you're not
supposed to say "a theater."

It's kind of hip, actually.

Sure.
The theater.

I did a play recently that was
directed by Kathleen Turner.

Which is a sort of wonderful experience.

She's really great,
but she has that very recognizable...

Her voice seems to be getting
deeper and deeper and deeper.

It does in fact, and every night
before I go on stage,

she had sort of recorded
the announcement

that suggest the audience
to turn off their cell phone.

So every night
before I got on stage, I hear,

"Ladies and gentlemen,
please turn off your cell phones.

If you have any gum or candy,
please unwrap it now."

Very strong.

Do you do any other impressions?

I do.
What else do you have?

I have Holly Hunter.
Holly Hunter. Okay.

Dave, listen. It's great. I mean,
I thought you were great.

I mean, I am so excited to be here.
My show <i>Saving Grace</i>, it's a great show.

And, I mean, it's great.

I love this audience,
everyone's great. You're great.

Also very good.

A dolphin, is that right? Is that a dolphin?

Would you like to see that one?

Okay.

Wow. Do that in the cockpit.
Everything'll be good.

And finally... And this--
I like this because it's a little...

I mean, this is a specialty impression.

Julia Roberts, but Julia Roberts smiling.

Is that correct?

And from the side.
Smiling and from the side.

Okay, all right. Let's take a look.

Are you ready?
I am ready.

Yeah. Okay. All right.

You and Julia Roberts do bear
a pretty strong resemblance.

I wish that were true.

No, it is true. So we're gonna have
to take away points for difficulty.

Because it was...

So you can see <i>Cupid</i>,
premieres March 31, 10 p.m. on ABC.

Gosh, it was nice meeting you.

Thank you.
Thank you so very much.

Ladies and gentlemen, Sarah Paulson.

We'll be right back with Bloc Party.

All right, ladies and gentlemen.

Our next guests are an acclaimed
rock 'n' roll band from England.

I'm gonna show you something
here so get ready.

Get ready to take a look at this.
It's their most recent album.

Get ready to take a look at this.

Let's see this thing.

It's called <i>Intimacy</i>. Are you ready?

See this thing. I'd like to see this.
Yeah, I'm ready.

Seriously, if you're not ready,
I'm not gonna...

No, I think we're ready. I'd like to see it.

Oh, wow. Intimate. That's intimacy.

Look at that.

I get the feeling some of you
weren't ready for that.

That's their most recent album, <i>Intimacy</i>.

Please welcome back
