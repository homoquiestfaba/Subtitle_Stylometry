A woman came up to me one day...

Thanks, Darrin.

You're welcome.

She said I'm not ready...

I'm not ready to give up
my wicked ways...

You want to be
my girlfriend?

Sorry, but I want to marry
Michael Jackson.

Darrin, Lilly,
get in there and sit down.

...he gives me a hard time

Yeah, yeah

I told that woman

I told that woman how
could you hold out any longer

When you see that Jesus...

Oh, alleluia

I'm looking for that stone,
yes, I am

Flew down the mountain

And it's coming

Yes, it is

Oh, yeah, and the Lord

All the way down
Coming all down

To redeem a dying world
To redeem...

Yes, it is

...a dying world

A dying world.
World!

Bless you.

Oh, my goodness,
there she goes again.

Wouldn't be a normal Sunday

if Faye didn't get
slain in the spirit.

Uh-huh.

Oh, Maryann.

Pastor.

This boy is growing like a weed.

You must be feeding
him fertilizer.

And his teachers say
he's the smartest in his class.

There she is.

Hold her, Reverend.

The nerve.

Standing in the house of God

and all the while
singing the devil's music.

Paulina, what's this all about?

I found this down
at Robinson's store.

It's Maryann,

singing that R&B sex music.

Oh. Oh, uh, uh,

uh, Maryann. Maryann!

What you got to say
about all this?

I finally got my chance
to become a singer.

I didn't think
anything was wrong.

Reverend, the church bylaws
clearly state

that no member shall partake
of fornication,

Amen.

Gambling.

Amen.

And drinking, which
is all going on down

at that juke joint
where she sings.

Just take a look at this.

"Do it to me again."

My, my, my, my, my.

Now, we all know
what "it" means.

Paulina.

I'm surprised you'd
even remember what "it" is.

And besides,

what were you doing
down at the record store

Iooking through
"the devil's music"?

I got the Lord on my
side with this one.

Paulina, you need to hush.

Tell her, honey.

Because this girl

ain't doing nothing
to hurt nobody.

Amen, sister Sally.

Need I remind you
of the church motto?

Tell her, sister!

"Beware of brief delight
and lasting shame."

That must be them kids
on that organ again.

I'm-I'm gonna go.

Stop stalling, Paul.

You know the church rules.

You're supposed to handle this.
Paulina,

I'm the pastor here.
Leave it to me, please?

You do your job, boy,
or I'm going to go and get Mama.

Now, you know you're supposed

to call me "reverend"
around here.

I'm going to handle this
my way, okay?

Now, Maryann.

It's like this.

It's like she says.

You stop singing
that secular music,

or you're going to have
to leave the choir.

I'm sorry.

It's your pick.

Make up your mind, child.

Think about what
you're doing, sister.

Wave good-bye to Aunt Sally.

Darrin, here's that

market research you wanted,

and I know you're real busy,

but there's something
you should know.

Yes... I'm going
to blow them away.

I'm a player.

I'm in the zone.

Corner office, huge window.

Take care of these
credit card bills for me.

All right.

Use this one
to pay off this one, okay?

Okay.
And, uh, do a balance transfer

from... oh, excuse me...
from here to here

for that one, all right,

and cover this one
with that one.

So, what were you
trying to say earlier?

There's a private investigator
over there looking for you.

Why?

Who's trying to find me?

I'm double checking...
is Darrin Hill around?

What did he say?
Did you tell him anything?

Does he know what I look like?

No. Chill.

I told him you're not in,

so he's leaving a message.
Uh, tell him I'm out of town.

I did.

Good.

Time to climb
the corporate ladder.

By our projections,

this plan will increase
the market shares

of Lincoln & Gerald Liquors
by a whopping eight percent

in as little as two years.

We were hoping to see
faster growth.

We can give them
double digit growth.

As I said, it is

the company position that
eight percent growth should be

the goal.

Now...
lf there's a different opinion

that'll lead to better growth,
we want to hear it.

Now let me ask you

which demographic consumes
the most malt liquor?

Go ahead, you can say it.

Black people.

There you go.

Very good.

However, I noticed
in your company report

that you don't have
a malt liquor division.

I noticed that, too.

I propose

a new ad campaign
for a malt liquor division

that maximizes exposure
in the African-American market.

Place positive images
of your product

in areas
where black people live.

By tapping into
the buying power

of this consumer base,

you'll pass single-digit growth
faster than a pro athlete

can get his criminal charges
dropped.

That, my friends,
is not thinking outside the box.

That's realizing
there is no box.

Now, those are the kind of ideas
we hired this company for.

Where have you been hiding
this one, Fairchild?

He's one
of our junior executives.

This man needs to be
on the team.

I mean, he was a junior
executive... before today.

Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.

Thank you, sir.

Where'd you learn
that kind of thinking?

Yale.
Oh, I'm a Princeton man myself,

but I see we let one get away.

Okay, well, we better leave

and let them get started
on this interesting idea.

Well, I guess I'll be giving you

a corner office with a view.

Thank you, sir.

Cigar?

Well, this is France's finest.

I first encountered it
growing up in Monte Carlo.

Please, you're a New York boy
if I ever saw one.

No, I lived there
until I was 17.

Wow, I have never met a brother
who grew up in Europe before.

Actually, I was born
in South America.

Where?

Homé Vidéo.

That's in Peru, right?

Venezuela.
My father was in oil.

You sound so American.

Well, I went to prep school
here... at Andover.

Money was no object.

Cool.
Mr. Hill,

I'm afraid your credit card
has been declined.

R-Right, that was, uh,
not activated yet.

Okay. Uh... try this one.

Darrin, Mr. Fairchild
wants to see you

first thing in the morning.

Great.

Great, great, great.

As you can see,
there is nothing

in my refrigerator but water,

water and wine.

This is the dining room.

We don't spend a lot of time

in here so it looks
very nice and well-set.

Like this chandelier...

it's not just
a normal chandelier.

It's just kind of funky and fun.

You wanted to see me, sir?

Darrin.

What I have to say
is very difficult.

We have a, uh... situation.

A situation that involves
deception,

a lack of candor,

and an unbridled passion

to get what one wants
at any cost.

I think you know
what I'm referring to.

Of course, sir, company policy.

No, no, no...

well, yes, of course it is,

but in this case
it's something more personal.

Darrin, you're fired.

Fired?

But why?

A representative
of Lincoln & Gerald

has an annoying habit
of checking up on things.

It seems that you were
thrown out of Yale

when it was discovered

you faked your high school
diploma from Andover.

How long did you think
it would take

before your deception
caught up with you?

But, sir,
I've been doing such good work.

Mr. Hill,

we cannot be represented
by people who tell lies.

We're in advertising.

You obtained this job
under false pretenses,

and now you've caused the firm
great embarrassment

in front of important clients.

I'm sorry.
I have to let you go.

You're good, you're smart,

but you broke
the Eleventh Commandment...

"Thou shalt not get caught."

Now...

Sir, please,
you're making a big mistake.

I'm here for you.

I'm smart, I'm ambitious...

Have your things

out of here in half an hour.

I'm disappointed in you.

I expected more
from a congressman's son.

Darrin Hill?

Yes.

You've been a tough one
to track down, Mr. Hill.

I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

but this is for you.

What is it? A subpoena?
Summons?

Ploy to distract me
while you repo my stuff?

Sure, those are fun,
but no.

Oh, my Aunt Sally died.

"We request your presence
at the funeral

and reading of the will."

Oh...

The funeral is tomorrow.

Maybe you should
ask your boss

for some time off.

You know you just cut
a brother, right?

Oh.

Hurts when you do that, man.

Sorry.

Come on, baby.

Make me happy.

Cash advance.

Be a winner.
Be a winner.

Whoo-hoo!

Thank you, Bank of Piscataway.

Heaven only knows

How much I love you, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
oh, oh, oh

Heaven's in your eyes...

Baby, please

Please don't take
your love from me

I am yours forevermore

Till eternity

Silently

Listen to the words
I say

Now I'm not talking
just for play

Listen to me, please...

I told you kids ain't got

no business playing
a man's game.

Funny, that's the same thing
someone told me...

oh...

two hours ago.

Don't you know

Don't you know,
don't you know

Love is all I need

'Cause I love you
and I need you

Yes, I want you,
gotta have you

Ooh, yeah, yeah.

Spent my whole life

On the way
to someplace else

Thinking right around
the bend

I might find myself

But the search goes on

I won't quit
till I get home.

Hi.

Hi.

Can I get something
to eat around here?

Reed?

Coming right up.

Better make that to go.

I need a taxi.

Reed's only got two hands.

Wait until he fixes
your dinner.

Right.

No signal.

Wait, wait, wait.

Oh!

You must be Darrin.

Damn, word, get low.

What's up?

Darrin, I'm Lucius, man,

I'm your welcome committee.

Oh, well,
how'd you know I was here?

Man, word travels
fast, and Aunt Sally

always bragged she had a
successful nephew from New York.

Let me get your stuff, man.

Really?

Come on.

Oh.

Monte Carlo didn't change, man.

It used to be a one-horse town.

What, did the horse die?

No, see, see, now you'll see,
you'll see, you'll see.

We got everything to offer
that a big city does.

Oh.

I'm happy to have another
player in town, man.

I've got tired of
holding this down solo.

Hey, man, reach over there

and pull this handle
from the inside.

It only open from the inside.

Okay.

Appreciate that.
Sure.

So you came by train.
That's cool.

I was trying to meet the bus.

Going to the Canaan Inn.

Okay, that-that Canaan Inn,

that's straight down this road

about five minutes.

Oh. Whoa.

Your door won't open,
and mine won't stay shut.

But it opens.

Oh.

Yes, it opens.

The next hour of programming

is brought to you by
Mitchell's Funeral Home,

where the caskets are so nice,
you'll wish you were dead.

Now for the news.

Like to give a shout out
to Darrin Hill,

in town for Sally's funeral.

Welcome home, little Darrin.

That's news?

I'll be right back
with traffic.

There is no traffic.

There is no traffic.

This is easy.
I could do this job.

Oh, I wonder what
the temperature is.

The temperature is 85.

Thanks.

Boy, you done got up there
in New York and got soft,

and this ain't nothing compared
to July and August.

That's when you can take an egg
and just fry it on the sidewalk.

Well, you can keep that.

After the funeral, I'm going
straight back to New York City,

where we don't have eggs frying
on the sidewalk.

Why? Because it's cold?

No, because it's civilization.

There's too much urine
on the sidewalk.

See, boy, see, you don't
know what you're missing.

Now I'm telling you,
now the hotter

it get down here,
the less and less

the honeys start wearing.

You know, they got to
let that booty bo...

...got to let
that booty breathe.

Now I'm telling you,

I know you got all your

Naomo Campbos
and your Holle Berrys,

and your Teary-Eyed Banks,

all them models
and junk up there,

but for the booty, you
got to come down south.

We booty experts.
Booty-ologists.

Booty is in the eye
of the beholder.

No, booty gonna be in my hand.

Check it out now, you see,

now your Louisiana booty,
it gets its renowned buoyancy

from its heavy seafood diet,
while your Alabama booty,

it's characterized
by its density.

You're talking
about a quarter-bouncing ping.

And as for your
Mississippi booty,

it's been an ongoing debate,

but consensus say that the
Indian-genetic contribution

gives us its beautiful tone.

And as for your
Georgia booty,

it's been known for ages
that the Georgia sun

bakes and seals
all the booty juices

into a slow roast.

I see I'm dealing
with a connoisseur.

Oh yeah, for sure.
A booty connoisseur.

Oh. Who's that?

Lilly. Please, hurry up.

That's Lilly.

Forget all of that booty stuff.

She's in a spectrum
of fine as the energy

is so potent, she got
a class-action suit

against her right now

for reckless endangerment, man.

Sounds like

a special kind of woman.

Well, holler at me
later on tonight.

I'll hook you up with her.

This is where you're staying.

I thought they were
putting me up in a hotel.

This looks like a house.

It's a boarding house.

It's the only place
that has room.

The prison officer's
convention is in town.

Hey, Jimmy B.

Hey, what up, Smooth L?

His grandmother
owns the place.

You Darrin?

Yes.

You're late.

Yo, come on, everybody
is already at the funeral.

Um... uh...
Get in.

Mama catch me put a whuppin'
to my backside

And even as a crack fiend...

Hey, man, now, come on, look.

That's inappropriate
music for this occasion.

Show some respect.

This man's auntie is
about to be maggot food.

At any moment, the funeral
is beginning

of Sally Walker.

Let us have a moment of silence
to pay our respect.

Uh, uh, sorry 'bout that.

I guess I was celebrating
her life

a little late, uh,
into the night.

Oh, Simon. Sarah,
how are y'all doing today?

This is Aunt Sally's nephew,
Darrin.

Nice to meet you.

Sorry about your aunt.

Oh, yes, we all
loved Miss Sally.

Why, she was little
Nicholas' godmother.

Hey, little man.

You know I'm your daddy, right?

Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

I'm in the friggin'
twilight zone.

Wake up.

Wake up.

Oh, Sally!

Why'd it have to be her?

Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.

Good Lord, Faye!

Couldn't you find someplace else
to be slain in the spirit?

Grandma, get up.

She's your grandma?

Yeah.
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord.

They've got a lot of nerve

showing their faces
in the House of God.

I'm glad my dear departed
husband James

isn't here to witness
this abomination.

You can't keep people
from a funeral, Paulina.

Besides, they all love Sally.

They're a bunch of heathens.

I don't even know why she cared.

Move down.

Brothers and sisters,
we are gathered here today

to pay tribute
to a great woman...

Yeah!

...Sally Walker.

And we will now be blessed
with a selection from the choir

and their lead singer,

Reverend Shirley Caesar.

Oh...

I got a signal. It's a miracle.

Son, if that ain't Jesus
calling, shut it off.

Sorry. Go on.

I, uh... I...

cell phone's been out of range.

Has Mr. Fairchild
changed his mind?

I...

What?!

They've already started
repossessing your stuff.

Not my TV!

Nothing can replace Aunt Sally!

Not my TV, not my Bose
home theater system...

Yeah, let it out, son,
let it out.

Mm, yeah. Mm.

Keep stalling the creditors,
I'll call you back.

It's all right.

Gonna be all right, man.

The church is in mourning

Mourning

Glory to God

The church is in mourning

Mourning

Oh, yes, oh, yeah, yeah, oh

The church is in

Mourning

Mourning

Good God almighty

Another soldier

A true born soldier

Has gone...

Gone home

Hallelujah!

Well, we're here today

For the home-going

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

And the celebration
of a wonderful woman

Aunt Sally

Everybody loved Aunt Sally

She took the young people

And carried them under her wings

And she cared for the elderly

I just want to say, listen

We might not have this chance

Sleep on, Aunt Sally

Sleep on, Aunt Sally

And take your rest

We loved you, Aunt Sally

But God loves you best

If you see my mother there

Tell my mama I'm on my way

I'm on my way

Our hearts are in mourning

Mourning

Glory to God

Yes, to lift our hearts
in mourning

Mourning

Good God almighty

Good God almighty

Yes, to lift our hearts
in mourning

Soldier

Another soldier

A true born soldier

A Holy Ghost soldier

A heaven-bound soldier

Has...

Gone

Gone, gone

Gone

Gone on home

Gone home

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

Yeah...

Hallelujah!

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah...

Let the church say amen.

Amen!

Let the church say amen.

Amen!

Yes, Lord...
Amen.

Yes, Lord!

Yes, yes, yes.
Well, well, well.

At this time,

we'd like to give

some of Sally's
family and loved ones

an opportunity
to come up here

and say how much
she meant to them.

And it's only fitting
to start with the person

that came the farthest way
to be here.

That's her great-nephew, Darrin.

All right, Darrin, all right.

Oh, yeah, brother Darrin.

Yes, my brother.

Come on.

Oh, yeah. Amen.

Hi.

Many of you don't remember me.

The one that had the phone.

Yeah. But before that,

I was Aunt Sally's
favorite nephew.

Hmm!

I thought we'd see forever,

but forever's gone away.

And it's so hard
to say good-bye

to yesterday.

Boyz II Men.

I got one amen.
Can I get another?

Amen.

My mom passed away
a few years ago

in a hit-and-run accident

when I was still a teenager,

and it's the talks
I had with her

I cherish more than anything.

I remember her telling me...

that it was Aunt Sally
who took us in

when I was just a baby,
after my father died in Vietnam.

I'll always love her for that.

Your mama dead, too?

He just said it.

Young man,

I'm so glad that you came
for your aunt's funeral.

Yeah.

She was always telling us

how well you were doing
up in New York.

With your important job.

What was it?

What was what?

Your job.

It's funny, she never mentioned
what it was.

Boy, I haven't seen you

since you were knee-high
to a grasshopper.

Reverend, um, have you seen
this very pretty lady...

I think her name is Lilly?

She ain't no lady.

Oh, now, Mother Cooley.

All sinners are welcome
in the house of the Lord.

Sinner? She's a sinner?

What kind of sinner?

Unrepentant.

Really.

Well, Darrin, I just come

to offer you my condolences
and to just let you know

that to be absent from the body
is to be present with the Lord.

You got to understand
that she's in

a far better place, okay?

Yes, ma'am.

You know, I got to tell you,

you and that choir...
boy, you're pretty good.

Pretty good? Huh.

And to my neighbor
and best friend, Faye,

I leave all my favorite recipes.

Thank you, Sally.

Now, Faye, depending

on what I die from,

you might want to divide
the Crisco measurements by half.

Don't change
that Chicken Supreme.

And to Paulina Pritchett,

I leave my collection
of church hats

that she always
complimented me on.

She should really enjoy
wearing them,

unless, of course, she was lying
to me all those years

but criticizing my taste
behind my back.

I'll wear them every Sunday.

And now,
for my only surviving relative,

my great-nephew, Darrin.

To Darrin, I leave the box

containing the letters
his mother sent me

after they left Monte Carlo.

I also pass on to him

the charge of returning
to Monte Carlo

to continue the family tradition

of... directing
the Beulah Baptist Church Choir.

No!
No.

I-lt's her dying wish.

I was next in line

to get the choir.

I been waiting years
for Sally to die.

God rest her soul.

Listen, lady, you can have it.

I'm not staying, let alone
leading some small-town choir.

Good.

O-On the condition that Darrin
gets the choir accepted

into the annual Gospel Explosion
in Columbus,

and performs there,
I also leave him

my entire stock
in Georgia Telecom,

currently worth $150,000.

I was just kidding
about that small-town stuff.

And the church bus.

How much that worth?

No way! Mm-mmm!

I don't care
what Sally's dying wish was.

We all know she was losing it
these last few years.

Besides, Paul,

it's your church,
and you have final say

over who leads
the choir.

It's in the bylaws.

Well, I guess
that would seem kind of odd

to have someone
with no musical experience

leading the choir.

No, no, I have plenty
of musical experience.

Now, you all
don't know this,

and I didn't tell
anyone, but, um...

I'm a music producer.

Oh.

Yeah, that's what
I do for a living.

Ooh, looks like Sally
might have been onto something.

W-W-W-What kind
of producing have you done?

Well, I've worked with, uh...
P. Diddy.

Dre, Dark Child...
all of them.

Who that?
That's the gangsta stuff

that's polluting
my grandson's mind.

I was the one that put an end

to that whole East Coast
versus West Coast thing.

Yeah, I just sat them all down
and made them watch <i>Roots.</i>

I think
I read about that.

So, what
is this Gospel Explosion?

Oh, it's the annual event

where choirs
from all over the southeast

come to Columbus, Georgia,

to compete for the best
gospel performance

and a $10,000 cash prize.

Yeah, a prize that could pay

for some much-needed
church repairs...

...if a certain musical producer

would bring it home, yes?

Paul Lewis, have you lost
your natural mind?

I wish Mama was alive

to see how you turn
on family like this.

Sally was as close to family
as anybody can get,

and I intend
on honoring her dying wish.

Now, Darrin,
the choir is yours.

You have six weeks

until the Gospel Explosion.

Whatever you need,

we're at your disposal.

But you're going to have to talk

to the church treasurer
about logistics.

Let me guess.

You're the treasurer.

Yes. Everything you need
is at my disposal.

Great.

Take it easy.

Oh, oh, uh, Paulina,

can I get a ride
back to my room?

Oh, Darrin.

Since you're going to be here

for longer than I thought,

let me give you
the extended stay rates.

Great.

There's an extra charge

of $1.50 for every
bar of soap you use,

from now on,
$2.00

for any clean towel you require,

and $1.00 a minute
for all calls made.

You get one
free 9-1-1 call.

I suggest you use it wisely.

Air conditioning?

You're charging me
for air conditioning?

It gets 100 degrees at night.

What is that?

It's a Monte Cristo.

It's a cigar.

Obviously.

Cuban?

Of course.

Cool.

Hey!

That-That cost me $20.

This is a no-smoking house.

It's a no-smoking,

no drinking, no fornicating,
no point of living at all house.

Why are we here?

You'll see.

A little Southern delight.

Now the honeys in here,
they make them girls in Atlanta

Iook like somebody hit them in
the face with a sack of nickels.

And I don't mean that
in a sexy way.

There she is.

You're on your own.

I see somebody
that owes me some money.

Hey man, don't run away from me.

Man, I told you
I was going to get...

Ooh, hi, sexy.
Hey, baby.

Oh...

You give me fever...

Fever... oh...

Oh...

You give me fever

Fever in the morning

Fever when

You give me fever

Fever

Fever when you kiss me

Fever when
you hold me tight

You give me fever

Fever

In the morning

And fever

Baby's so damn sexy

But baby

Baby knows just what to do

Got me boiling past 102

Give me a fever

Ooh...

Everybody's got a fever

That is something
you all know

Fever isn't such a new thing

Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet

And Juliet felt the same

When he puts
his arms around her

He said, "Julie, baby,
you're my flame"

Give me fever

When we kisseth

Fever with a flame in you

Fever... I'm on fire

Fever, yeah,
I burn and soothe

Now that you listened
to my story

Here's a point
that I have made

Chicks were born
to give you fever

Being Fahrenheit
or Centigrade

They give you fever

When you kiss them

And fever
if you live and learn

Fever, until you sizzle

What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to burn...

What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to...

Burn...

Fever.

Whoo!

Tea with honey.

Here you go, Lilly.

Thank you.

You really know how
to connect with your audience.

That was hot.

It's a part of my act.

I pick out the guy
who's drooling the most,

and I make him sweat.

Well, it worked.

Can I buy you a real drink?

I'm Darrin.

You really don't remember me?

That Lilly?

You kept asking me
to be your girlfriend.

And you kept saying no.

Yeah, I was determined to be
Mrs. Michael Jackson.

And how's that going?

Ah, turns out
I'm not his type.

I can't believe you
remember that stuff.

I left town when you
were what, five?

Four.

Man, we heard about you
all the time.

Every week in choir rehearsal,
Sally would tell

us poor country folk
how well you

and your mama were
doing in slick city.

She was very special
to all of us.

Yeah.

When I talked to her
on the phone,

just before she passed,

she kept saying that
she wanted me to come back

and be with her
friends, like you.

You spoke with Sally that day?

Oh, yeah.

She went on and on.

I suppose she hung up
the phone and, uh...

And her dying wish
was for us to hook up?

God love her.

Sally was in a coma
two weeks before she died.

That's right.

It was...

must have been a couple
of weeks ago...

Right.

Anyway, I'm back

amongst all you
wonderful people

who need consoling
as much as I do.

How long are you in town?

Just tonight.

Hey, how about being
my girlfriend,

for old times' sake?

I've got a man.

Oh.

Dean is big and strong

and has a real big
jealous streak.

Sometimes he watches
from the back.

Excuse me,
I got a show to do.

Uh, okay.

Hey, knock 'em dead.

Your act is terrific.

Yours needs a lot of work.

I know I missed your call, Rosa,

but this is the only place
I get a signal.

More charges came in,
more late fees.

You're up to 44 grand now.

Okay, listen, I just came
into some money, all right?

And I'll be able to take care of
everything in just a few weeks.

Just, uh, make sure they
don't know where to find me.

I'll do my best.

You're a doll.

Kick ass.

Sorry.

Okay, when
everyone gets here,

we'll begin rehearsals.

I was thinking
we should just

stick to that number
you did at the funeral.

Should be good enough to get
into any gospel competition.

That was Shirley Caesar, fool.

She hasn't gone
to this church for years,

but since she loved Sally,

we let her and her choir
sing at the funeral.

She's gone?

She's gone.

Well, where's our choir?

You're looking at it.

This is it?

Six measly people.

Actually just five.

Um, I'm just here 'cause
my wife's family's in town.

They're staying at my house.

Too late.

You're in the choir now.

Well, actually there
are two or three others.

Yeah, but they never show up.

Man, this is busted.

Why do I have to be here?

Oh, Brother Darrin?

When are you going to get us
our first record contract?

I want to hurry up
and get a Benz.

Hey, I didn't know we
were going to be famous.

You know what?

Definitely count me in now.

Um... let's do, uh...
"Amazing Grace."

Amaze...

Maze...

Amaze...

Ah-amaze...

...zing grace

How sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me.

Stop, stop, stop.

Stop, please.

Okay, okay, okay,
let's not panic.

Um...

I'm open to suggestion.

Hey, when you get us
that record deal,

and they do one of those
VH1 <i>Behind the Musics</i> on us,

I think it's best
if we don't talk about

me trying to leave the group.

You know?

They'll just make it look ugly.

Everything I do
is just for you

Counting every second
till we rendezvous

You want
to rendezvous

Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, baby, oh, baby

Oh, and I want to give it
to you, baby

Give it to me, baby

I want to give it to you

Oh, give it to me, baby

Hey...

'Cause everything I do
is just for you

'Cause everything
I do is just for you

All for you

Come on, give me your love.

Uh, hello, there.

I just had
to see you again.

Aren't you supposed
to be gone?

Yes, but, uh,
I was feeling bad

about our little
misunderstanding last night.

No misunderstanding,

just using Aunt Sally's memory
to hit on me.

That's low.
Come on.

Can I at least
buy you a drink?

Is that Dean?

No.

Okay, you can buy me a drink.

Oh, I'm sure you heard

about Aunt Sally's will.
No.

It seems she wants me

to take care of
the choir down at Beulah.

Why did she put you
in charge of it?

I'm sorry,
that came out wrong.

Oh, no, no, no.

It's okay,
it was a shock to me, too.

Yeah, it's a big job.

That's why I've cleared my
schedule for the next six weeks,

put some business deals on hold,

so that I can focus
on getting the choir

into the Gospel Explosion.

No.

I been there and done that.

Look, if it's Paulina
you're worried about,

I'll take care of Paulina.

I'd love to see that one.

I'm the choir director now.

Yeah, for six weeks.

Listen, if she starts getting
all Christian on you...

Christian?
Yeah.

She is not a Christian.

My mama said hollering
in the church

don't make you
any more of a Christian

than standing in the garage
makes you a Cadillac.

No, man, I can't let
those hypocrites

Iook down their noses at me
just because I...

Sing sexy songs for a living.

Exactly.

And just because I...

Dress like that.

What's wrong with
the way I dress?

Oh, no, no, I'm just
finishing your sentence.

I was going to say
because I...

Cheat on your boyfriend

with hot choir directors
from New York City?

Stop...

Finishing your sentences?
Look.

I know your kind.

You came here last night
'cause you wanted something.

You came back again tonight
'cause you want something else,

and tomorrow you're going
to want something else.

I can smell when a man
is trying to use me,

and mister, you stink.

Okay, is that how
you feel about it?

Fine.

This town is full of singers.

I don't need you anyway.

And remember, everybody,
Handy's Funeral Home

offers limousines
for all occasions.

Why not get in one
while you're still living?

Well, now that we done
paid the bills...

Ladies and gentlemen,

sitting directly
across from me,

I have Mr. Darrin Hill
all the way from New York City.

So Darrin,

tell the good people
of Monte Carlo

what brings you
down here with us?

I'm responsible
for rebuilding the choir

down at Beulah Baptist Church.

In fact, I'm holding auditions
tomorrow morning,

and anyone with any musical

ability can come by.

As long as they are,
as we say at Beulah,

fully committed to God's work.

Amazing Grace

How sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me.

Whoa!

Forgiving my sins

Baptized in the water

Freed by the Holy Ghost

Washed in the blood
of the lamb

Forgiving my sins

Baptized in the water

Freed by the Holy Ghost

Washed in the blood
of the lamb

God's going
to move this place

God's going to move
this place

God's going to turn the world
upside down

Auditions for the Beulah Baptist
Church Choir are still open.

Applicants need not be fully
committed to God's work,

but shouldn't be against it.

I'm the hottest shit in
New York since Air Force Ones

And from the borough that
brought you Chris and Pun

Yeah, a lot of cats rhyme,
but not like some

I make it hard, like breathing
with a slug in your lung

Blow, blow, now you got
to deal with me

Isn't she lovely?

Isn't she wonderful?

Isn't she precious?

Isn't she precious?

Just one minute old

You got to be kidding me!

I never thought
true love would bring

One that's has lovely as she

But isn't she lovely?

Made from love.

News update.

Auditions for the Beulah
Baptist Church Choir,

atheists may now apply.

Oh, thanks for coming, Lucius.

No problem.
Where to?

Oh, I just need to print
up some more fliers.

Paulina won't let me use
Jimmy B's printer anymore.

She says it's running
up her light bill.

Oh, well, you know
old folks in the south

believe some crazy stuff.

Tell me about it.

When it's storming,

she doesn't even
use the electricity.

You don't play with God.

Right.

You don't sing, do you, Lucius?

Do I sing? Y-Yeah.

They say I sound like
a black Al Jarreau.

Great, you're in the choir.

Oh, whoa, wait a minute.
What'd you say?

Pump your brakes.

I'm not planning on
joining the church

until I have sown my wild oats.

Then I'm going to get me
a young virgin and settle down.

Say no more.

Besides...

word's out.

Paulina's bad enough,
you done pissed her off.

Don't nobody want
to be a part

of that mix
made in hell.

Now the only way
I can join is...

is if... is if you paying.

How about the prize money?
50/50?

Done deal, 50/50.

Hello, are you Joseph?

Yeah.

Can I line you up, son?

Actually I just came by
to post some fliers

for my choir auditions,
if that's okay.

Sure.

Seeing how you're new
in these parts,

it's going to be kind of hard
for you

to attract people.

Most folks around here,

they don't trust an outsider.

It was years
before I told anyone

I'm not from Mississippi.

I've got a guy here

who needs his ears lowered.

Hey, Lilly.

Dean, my man.

Come on,
I'll get the seat.

That's Dean?

He's big, strong and jealous,

so watch yourself.

So I see you done met

the big-time music producer
from New York, huh?

Music producer?

Lilly has the best

voice in town.

I know.

You don't have to wait with me.

No one else's mom
waits for them.

He'll be fine.

Okay, I'm going to be
next door, all right?

Dean, don't talk to strangers.

Yo, big man.

You want us to sing you
a song like we did last time?

Yes, please.

It'll cost you.

I'll give you
a thousand money.

Deal.

Ooh...

When I was a little boy

When I was just a boy

And the devil
would call my name

When I was just a boy

I'd say "Now who do,

Who do you think
you're fooling?"

When I was just a boy
I'm a consecrated boy

When I was just a boy

I'm a singer in a Sunday choir

Oh, my mama loves me

She loves me

She get down on her knees
and hug me

Oh, she loves me like a rock

She rocks me
like the rock of ages

And loves me

She love me, love me,
love me, love me

When I was grown
to be a man

Grown to be a man

And the devil would
call my name

Grown to be a man

I'd say "Now who do,

Who do you think
you're fooling?"

Grown to be a man
I'm a consummated man

Grown to be a man

I can snatch a little purity

Oh, my mama loves me,
she loves me

She get down on her knees
and hug me

Like she loves me like a rock.

Lilly.

You know, at first I was
afraid you'd follow me here,

but I actually feel a lot safer

knowing you're not
in the same room with my son.

And to answer
your next question, no...

You're not married.

Don't finish my sentences.

That's why you're
a sinner.

Stay far away from me.

No, no...

No, I'm saying, that's no
reason to treat you badly.

I mean, how dare they?

It's not your fault.

Well, it's 50% your fault

because it takes
two people to...

Well, you know what I mean.

No.

I'm saying it's a pity

that you don't have
a complete family,

but it's still no reason...

Oh, don't talk to me
about family,

Mr. Didn't Call Aunt Sally
For 20 Years.

Hi.
Hi.

I'm sorry.

I'm starting to see how
tough things are for you.

Oh, yes.

Boo-hoo for the poor,
black mother

stuck in her hometown
without a man.

Whatever shall I do?

I didn't mean it that way.

Excuse me, Lilly, I'm sorry,

but your card
is maxed out again.

I forgot to put
my paycheck in.

Thank you.

Excuse me.
Hmm-mm.

Hey, try this one.

Sorry, Dr. Hill,

yours is declined, too.

Dr. Hill? You a doctor?

No, that's just my music name.

You know, like Dr. John,
Dr. Dre.

Try this one.

Well, that's cleared.

Of course.

Sign here.

Thank you.

That was really nice.

You didn't
have to do that.

That's what I'm saying,
I'm a nice guy.

I don't know
what the problem is.

I usually get along better
with beautiful women.

Okay, I'll...

I'll give you a check
tomorrow, first thing.

Oh, um, cash.

Cash.

Reverend.

Oh... Darrin.

Thanks for meeting me here.

Uh, how's it going
with the choir?

Well, I'm still having trouble
recruiting the members.

Son, it's at times like these

I suggest listening
to God's voice.

Sorry, Rev, I'm not
into the spooky stuff.

Oh, just open it up.

And these people can sing?

Oh, yes.

Please don't tell my sister.

Hello, everyone.

I'd like you to welcome

the new members of our choir.

So when is this competition?

In a few weeks.

And our new organist.

You touch my keyboard

and I kick your
drunk 'bama ass.

Oh, oh, wait, Homer.

Now, if we stand any chance

of getting into
the Gospel Explosion,

we could use
all the help we can get.

Shoot.

Bringing all these drunks

up into the church
with hats on

and drunks and everything.

Okay, everyone, please.

Okay, good.

Good. Uh...
I'd like to...

I'd like to try a new song.

Um... uh...

Tasha?

Can you, uh, get rid
of the gum, please?

Sure.

Okay.

That was nasty.

Uh..."Swing Low,
Sweet Chariot."

Oh, ah, uh, Homer, please.

Scooter.

Swing low

Sweet chariot

Comin' for to carry me
home...

Wait-wait-wait,
wait, wait, stop, stop.

Stop, wait, um...
this is not working.

Um...

You need to pick
a lead singer.

You'd know that if you knew what
you were doing.

Oh, oh, could-could I maybe try?

Bessie...

would you, uh, like to try?

No.

My dear departed
husband James said

that when I sing, it
made him think of heaven.

Probably meant he wanted
to blow his brains out.

Paulina,

you've sung lead

before?
I have,

and it gave me great joy.

Oh, good. Then it'll hurt
that much more

when I find someone else.

Be careful, Dean, baby,
don't hurt yourself.

Oh, let the boy be.

He's already wearing
more protection

then they gave me
when I fought in the war.

Oh!

Hey.
Hey.

You're the pain in the butt
from the barbershop.

He must have heard
that somewhere.

Hi, there, young man.

I'm Lilly's grandfather.

Hello, sir.

I've been waiting
for a nice, strong young man

to come and whisk Lilly away.

Somebody did that already,
remember?

She shouldn't be wasting
the next 25 years of her life

taking care of no old man.

No, she should go off

and have a life of her own.

Cool!

Sammy Sosa.

What do you say?

He said cool.

Dean?

Thank you.

Look, Granddaddy.

I got Sammy Sosa.
Oh, okay.

So have you changed
your mind about the choir?

Why should I,
'cause you gave Dean a toy?

No. Yes?

Why is this so important to you?

Because it's what
my Aunt Sally wanted me to do.

Every time I pack my bags
to leave,

I get that image
of her helping my Mom out

when I was little...

and because
it was her last wish

to get into the Explosion,

and because...

And because
you're getting $150,000.

I thought I'd finish
your sentence for you.

That is the truth, right?

Yeah. Yes.

Thanks for being honest,

but I can't.

What?

You mean, I just told the truth
for nothing?

Thank you for the loan
yesterday.

I know you want cash.

You know, this truth stuff
is highly overrated.

I don't care who started it.

You both should be ashamed.

Okay, let's try it
once more from the top.

Hey. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

I'm not doing this for you.

The truth is I'm doing this
for Sally.

Well, thank you anyway.

Choir, I'd like you to meet
our new soloist, Lilly.

What's your last name?
Tramp.

I knew this would happen.

No-no-no, wait, wait,
wait, please, please.

Let me handle this. Please.

Have you forgotten that Jesus
loved Mary Magdalene?

She was a ho.

"Let him who is without sin

cast the first stone."

Thank you for handling it.

No, no, no, no, no,
I-I don't mean it.

I'm just saying it
for effect. Please.

It is your duty

to help fallen women.

I'm willing to help.

Hi.
I agree. It's about time

we get some young Baptist booty
up in this choir.

Ask her how come she has to keep
so many husbands

away from their homes down

at that old sin hole
she be working at.

Would Aunt Sally
have been this harsh?

No.

No, Sally would've wanted Lilly
to stay in the choir...

Amen.
Unlike some people.

Amen again.
That's right.

If she was a respectable woman,

she would have
a respectable job.

The last thing we need
is another loose woman

up in the choir stand.

Now she should just
go on home, take care

of that little bastard baby...

Leave my son out of this.

Talk to her. Tell her.

Dean is a gift from God.
