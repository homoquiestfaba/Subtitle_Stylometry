Gimme back that money!

Pow, pow, pow!

I got you now!

Pow, pow, yeah!

Hey. What's up with the dolls, Beeman?

Here you go.

Hey, I got it right here, right here.

They're waiting for us.

<i>Yeah, you're not listening, okay?</i>

<i>I don't know why you're not listening,</i>

but you're not listening.

I'm already down eight million
on oil today, okay,

because some blogger says
China's going big on solar.

<i>Will, this is a huge risk.
You're overexposed.</i>

It doesn't matter.
<i>And over-leveraged.</i>

Look, I don't care if it's still
decades away from saving the world.

Just add another 150 points
to our position and do it fast

before the rest of the street
sees a not so sunny light.

<i>Laura's on the line.</i>
Yeah, thank you.

Hey, hun.

<i>Danny's in the principal's office.</i>

What?
He's been hit again.

Is he okay?

<i>Yeah, he's okay,
but he really needs his dad.</i>

I mean, right now?

I've got a kidney removal in an hour.

<i>There's no other doctor on call?</i>

Bill's here, but I'd rather
not hit him up again.

All right, yeah, I'll move
a few things around, okay?

<i>I'll go get him.</i>
Great.

All right, thanks, hun.
Yeah, all right, bye.

Hey, did the meeting with
the Saudis get moved to today?

Yes, 3:00 p.m.

Get Laura back on the phone, please?

<i>Got it.</i>

Fourth time this year, Will.

Will, what are you doing down there?

We're taking a trip.

Great, can you move my call
with GE to next week?

<i>Yes, absolutely, got that taken care of.</i>

Perfect.
<i>Have a good trip.</i>

See you Monday, then.
<i>Bye.</i>

You ready for this, kiddo?

You know, my dad took me
on my first deer hunt

when I was half your age.

I don't know, Dad.

Ah, come on, buddy,
you're gonna love it.

The rush, the feeling of accomplishment.

I told you, we're gonna do
everything the right way.

One shot, no pain, no suffering.

How do you know there's no suffering?

When was the last time
you got shot with a rifle?

Well, you get to see where I grew up.

First ten years, anyway.

And you'll get to see
Aunt Dottie for the first time

since you were a baby.

All set?
Yeah.

Jesus. Man, are you kidding me?

Marvin Howell.
That's the chief of police, Danny.

He was even a friend of
my dad's before his accident.

Dated Aunt Dottie, too, back in the day.

Let me see your license.

Billy Beeman? That's you?

Just Will now, sir.

William, right?
Your name is William,

but everybody calls you Billy?

You remember?
I do remember, yes.

Hey, this is my family,
this is Laura, my wife.

How do you do?
My son back there, Danny.

Hey, Danny, how you doing?

He's a very smart kid.

Hey, look, I'm sorry
about that close call.

I, uh, I don't know,
I wasn't paying attention.

I'm okay, you're okay, you're okay.

What brings you home?

Actually, we're going
for a weekend at Dottie's.

Gonna show Danny where I'm from.

Hm.

Roughing it?

Well, you're in for a treat, young man.

This little town is truly a gem.

You folks have yourself a nice visit.

Hey, thank you.

I'll only ask you for one favor.

I want you to keep your eyes open, okay?

We had a little trouble at the bank,
and I'm advising everybody

to exercise caution till it's resolved.

All right, will do.

And...

Drive carefully.

Thank you, sir.

All right, kiddo, come on.

Who's hungry?

The fridge is full, and
the place is all ready for you.

Daniel, you come give
your great aunt a hug!

Go on, give her a hug.

There's my little man!

God, it's been so long!

Laura, honey.
Hi, Dottie.

And there's my favorite nephew!

Only nephew.
Oh, well, who's counting?

You're not taking that thing
out tomorrow? Are you?

Yeah, why not?
That thing's gonna get stuck

before you can get started.
You take the Ridgeline.

That'll handle anything up there.

<i>Hey, Marv, what's up?</i>
How you doing?

Do you have anything to tell me?

For thousands of years,

men have viewed hunting as something

much more than just
a means of survival, Danny.

Okay, it's... it's a test of
character and courage.

I mean, the singular act

of tracking another
living creature, Danny,

and then possessing the will
and the skill to end its life.

All right, maybe this'll help.

Whoa, cool!

This was your grandfather's rifle.

He left it to me when he died.

One day, when you're ready,
it'll be yours.

Can I hold it?

Of course, kiddo, that's why we're here.

All right, but first,
there's some rules, okay?

Well, there's three of 'em.

Safety, safety, and safety, you got it?

Mm-hm.
This is a dangerous weapon.

I need you to promise me
you're gonna be extra careful.

I promise.
I'm serious.

I am, too.
All right, buddy.

Let me show you how to hold it.

Now, you grip it with your
left hand here, all right,

and you get the butt of the rifle

right into your shoulder,
just like that.

That's how you brace yourself, okay?

Now, the safety's on,

but you never put your finger
on the trigger

until you're ready to take
your shot, okay?

All right.

This, right here, this is
how you load the cartridge.

It's called bolt action.

See that?
Mm-hm.

There we go.

Now just imagine a huge
whitetail steps out of the brush.

And I'm talking a 12-point, 275 pounds,

a real prize animal.

And you got a clear shot,
just for a second,

so you line him up, you put
him dead in your cross hairs,

take a deep breath,
steady your nerve, and then...

Then what?

Well, then you find out
what you're really made of.

Wanna give it a try?

What do you say?
Yeah.

All right, let's do it. Here.

Now that's a loaded weapon,
all right? Safety's still on.

When you're ready.

That's all right.

First one's practice, come on.

Dang it.

It's okay, it's not easy.

Try again.

All right, Danny.
Just take your time, okay?

Take your time, I want you to focus.

Whoa-ho-ho!

That's my boy!

Good job, buddy.
Thanks.

All right, let's try again
with your eyes open, okay?

Dinner's ready!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Danny.

You never point your gun
at another person, ever.

Safety, safety, safety.
Good.

Let's go get something to eat.
Okay.

Come on, kiddo.

What's the matter?
You know where I stand.

Danny is who he is,
he doesn't need to change.

Him getting bullied doesn't
make him weak or inferior.

It's the problem with
the bully, not Danny.

Laura, no one's trying
to change him, okay?

But I mean, he's gotta learn
how to stand up for himself

and not be pushed around.

If you get out there, and he doesn't
wanna pull the trigger, don't make him.

Hey, kiddo.

Kiddo, time to wake up.

It's not even light out, yet.
Early bird catches the buck.

Come on.

One of my best memories of
grandpa is hunting in these woods.

Hey, check it out.

Cool.

Let's put your hood up.

Oh, I got you!

I got you.
Come on, Dad. Come on.

Come on.

Keep your hood up.

What's that?

Oh, that's a tree blind.

Hunters build them so
they have a hidden vantage

to gaze down their prey.

You know, sometimes they'll
spend days up in one of those,

waiting for just the right buck.

That's not fair.

Danny, fair's got nothin' to do with it.

Now let's hold up here.

Grab a sip.

All right, we're not actually
that far from the car.

There's a road right up
there that leads back

once we bag our deer, all right?

Come on, Dad,
we've been here all morning.

We haven't seen a thing.

Yeah, well we're not going anywhere.

Patience, buddy.

Dad. Dad, Dad.

Look.

Get down, get down, get down.

All right.

Chamber your round.

All right, take a deep breath.

And when you're ready, it's all you.

Okay.

It's all right.

Here, give me that.

He's probably the guy
from that ATV we saw.

Keep walking.

What's going on, Dad?

It's fine, it's nothing, all right?

Just stay here, one sec.

I told you, it's in a safe place.

Fuck you, that wasn't the arrangement.

I know, but there was
this car at the drop.

I swear, the guy inside
looked right at me.

Looked, I panicked and
took off to stash the bag.

Then where, where did
the fuck did you put it?

Listen, shouldn't we sit on
this a week or two, anyway?

What with all this heat on us now?

You are one stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

Fuck you.

I should've known you'd steal it,
you fucking hillbilly.

I didn't steal it, man,
the drop went bad.

You want it today?

I'll take you there.

You just give me my cut,
and we're through.

Just as we planned.

Well that plan is long gone now.

New plan is you got five seconds

to tell me where the fuck that bag is.

Yeah, I'll take you there.

You're just gonna kill me anyway.

Oopsie daisy.

You're a stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

Now nobody gets it.

Danny, shh.

Who's there?

Huh? I know someone's there, come out!

I said, come out!

Shh, Danny, it's okay, all right?

You hear?

I know you're there, come out!
Come out!

Dad!

Danny!

Stay there, Danny.

Fuck me.

<i>Dad!</i>

Stay there!

Dad, look!

Look, he's alive!

Danny, come here, now!

Shit. Shit.

Here, take this.

What are you doing?
Taking him to mom.

What about that thing
he threw over there?

I saw where it went.

This man's bleeding to death, come on!

Should we go get it?

Daniel, come on!

Laura!

Guys?

Oh my God, what happened?

He was shot.
Danny, go get some towels.

Who is he?
Uh, I have no idea.

He just appeared in the woods.

Laura, you've gotta do something.
He's lost a ton of blood.

Did you shoot him?

What, no!
Did Danny?

No, no, he was with
another guy, all right?

They were arguing about something,

and the other guy just
fucking shot him, point blank!

Why?

I don't know, all right?

I think he owed him money or something.

Um, where's the other guy now?

Danny, go play some video games.

Will, where is the other guy now?

I killed him.

You shot a man in front of our son?

I had no choice, all right?
We'd witnessed what he'd done.

He was gonna shoot us next,
it was self-defense.

What are you...

Hey, look, you weren't there, all right?

I did what I had to do!

Now can you please fucking
help this guy before he dies?!

He needs a hospital.

Yeah, well there's no time.
The nearest one's an hour away.

We'll call for an airlift.
Laura, you know better than I do,

this guy's running out
of time, all right?

Do something.

Hey, wake up!

Wake up!

There's bandages and gauze in my bag.

All right.

This is gonna hurt.

He's all right.

How are you doing?

Yeah, all right.

I'm gonna go up to Dottie's
and call him an ambulance.

Hey, Laura. Just hold on
a second, would you?

What?

Listen, it's just right now,

we're the only ones who know about this.

Why don't we just wait
for this guy to wake up

and tell us what happened?

What are you so worried about?

Hun, I mean, if it was
really self-defense,

it's not gonna be a problem...
He was a cop.

Laura, the guy I shot was a fucking cop.

Shh.

You let go of my son right now.

I can't do that, mister.
I need him.

What for?

Put the gun down.

Put the gun down!

All right, all right, all right.

He says he knows where my key landed.

I need that key more
than you can understand.

There's gonna be cops
all over that place

any minute now, so I gotta get there.

All right, all right, all right.
Why don't you take me instead?

Okay, I saw where it landed, too.

I mean, come on, he's just a kid.

You don't expect him to
remember the exact spot, do you?

I'll take my chances.

All right, then we all go.

Dottie!

It's okay, buddy.

Just hop in the back seat, okay?

Buckle up, kiddo.

Okay.

Giddyup, city boy.

Will!

You all right, Danny?
Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

Know where you're going?

Yeah.

You wanna tell me
what happened back there?

You seem like nice people.

I hope you get back to
that cabin before the cops do.

If so, I suggest you head home.

Why don't you let my son stay here?

I think he's been through
enough for one day.

Come on, man.

I don't need him seeing that body again.

Thank you.

All right, buddy,
you're gonna stay here.

I'll be right back, okay?
Just keep the doors locked,

and if you see anything,
honk as loud as you can, okay?

All right.

Can't have you trying to run off, now.

It's just up here.

Take me right there.

Freeze!

Stechel.

Don't do this.

Don't do it.
Get me that key.

Please, don't do it.

Ah, fuck!

Find the help wanted
notice board outside Earl's.

Meet me there.

Meet me there!

Ah.

Ah!

Damn it, my son's in there!

Dad! Dad!

Buckle up.

Fuck!

Get down and stay down!

Stop that.

We're just gonna play a game.

It's called Dukes of Hazard.

Shit.

Don't shoot! Hey!

Please stop!
Get down, and stay down!

Dad!

Don't fuckin' move!

My son is in that car.

Was there another officer
out here with that man?

Yeah. He's dead.

Shh.

I'm sorry.

Danny.

Goddamn shame.

Laura, come here.

Have you talked to anyone about
what happened this morning?

No, Dottie wasn't home, I couldn't call.

You sure? What about the cop
who drove you here.

What'd you tell him?
Nothing.

Nobody else saw this?

Nobody else heard this,
nobody heard any fuckin' gunshot?

All right, listen.

Danny and I never came back
to the cabin this morning, got it?

Okay.
We went out for our hunt...

We went out for our hunt, and
this is the first you've seen me since.

You don't know anything
about anyone getting shot

or stitching up any wounds
or anything, okay?

What are you talking about?
I can get Danny back.

How?
He offered me an exchange.

What, like ransom?
Before he was shot.

The guy through a key into a bush.

If I get it for him, Danny goes free.

Then do it!
I'm going to,

but it means not a word to
the cops until Danny's safe, okay?

Just get him back.

Will Beeman?

Twice in two days?

You wanna tell me what's going on here?

Yeah, um, I was out
taking my son for a hunt

when two men appeared out of nowhere.

The first guy caught me by surprise,
grabbed my Remington.

Levi Barrett is his name.
You've never seen him before?

He say or give anything to you?

Like what?

The Remington isn't your
pop's old shooter, is it?

So Levi snatches your stick
and turns on my officer.

Yeah, they both fired at the same time.

Officer Stechel got off a few rounds,

couple went into the side
of that barn over there.

How long was this before Richie arrived?

I don't know, maybe five minutes?

He says the boy was already
in the vehicle when he got here.

Doesn't make sense.

Yeah, well, uh, after Levi was shot,

he was in pretty rough shape,
so he went over there to sit down

and collect himself, and I sent Danny
up to the car to get a first aid kit,

and that's what he was doing
when Officer Richie arrived.

This is Officer Tom Davies.
One of my best and brightest.

He'll take care of anything you
need until you find your son.

All right.

How long did it take you
to walk up that ridge?

A few minutes.

You hear any shots on the way up?

Something doesn't feel right.

You think he's working with Levi...

I think he's lying, is what I think,

and if he is, I can't figure out why.

You stay on him, I'll handle Levi.

Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.

That's what all kidnappers say.

How would you know?

Because I watch TV.

How old are you?

Eleven.

Where are you taking me?

I'm not taking you anywhere.

I'm just trying to stay alive.

Why do you need me?

I made a deal with your dad
to get me my key.

If I let you go,
he's got no reason to do it.

What if he doesn't bring it?

He will.

Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

Haven't thought that far ahead yet.

That's when you start hurting me.

Why'd that cop shoot you?

Uh, it's grown up stuff.

Like making babies?

Yeah. Like making babies.

What are we doing?

Here? Walk.

You better be right about all this.

What'd you want me to do,
tell 'em I killed a cop?

Look, as soon as it's dark out,

I'm gonna go get that key
and find Levi, okay?

He's just a boy, Will.

He's a smart kid, all right?
He's gonna be fine.

I'm gonna make it fine, I promise.

Got a favorite game on that thing?

Yeah, I got a lot of games.
What's your favorite?

I don't know.

Well, I got some cool games
where we're going.

Killer Instinct's still my favorite.

My parents don't let me play that.

Ah. More grown up stuff.

Killer Instinct's one
to look forward to.

It's got some crazy shit.

Sorry. Gotta watch my tongue.

Did it hurt?
What?

Getting shot?
Ooh, wee.

Like a motherfucker. Oh.

Sugar snaps, I, uh, did it again.

There you are!

Who the hell is this?
It's Danny.

And you're supposed to be
watching the TV, keeping tabs.

I just checked, nothing new.
You sure?

After what I've been through today,
I thought Anderson Cooper'd

be checked in to the Beaumont by now.

Jesus.

His ma's the one who fixed me up.

I gotta go pee.

Oh, be my guest, right through there.

Just don't scare the kid.

<i>Still no suspects in Thursday night's...</i>

<i>Granville First National heist.</i>

<i>Police say they vow to return
all 2.3 million to the bank,</i>

<i>despite it being federally insured.</i>

<i>Bailouts are not the Granville way,</i>

<i>stressed police chief, Marvin Howell.</i>

<i>No, I ain't nobody's taxi to no place.</i>

<i>But he can't stay here the night,
they're gonna find us.</i>

<i>We have to stay here
until I get the key.</i>

<i>Just trust me, I know what I'm doing.</i>

You fall in?

Danny, you come on out now.

Danny!

There you are.

I though you might've try
to slither down the drain.

Oh, uh, that's Adele's mom.

Say hi, Mabel.

What's wrong with her?

What isn't wrong with her?

Diabetes, onset chronic renal failure,

80-pound tumor in her gut.

Eighty pounds?
That's more than I weigh.

Even with health insurance,
she can't afford proper treatment.

All right, yeah, uh, come on.

I'll show you them games
I was talking about.

Daryl, yeah, it's Levi.
Yeah, right, I need a favor.

Uh, you know that help wanted
notice board outside Earl's?

Yeah, that's the one.

Now write this down.

All right, I think it's dark enough.

I'm gonna head off.

Please just bring him home.

I will.

And, Will, if you do encounter Howell,
just... be careful.

This heist is the biggest crime

to hit Granville in decades,

and he's gonna solve it
one way or the other.

Take the jeep.

Thanks, Dottie.

Officer.

Give me the key.
What key?

Oh, yeah that key.

Okay.

Here you go.

What the... what the fuck?

Beeman.

You're fuckin' dead, Beeman!

You're having bad luck
with keys tonight.

Fuckin' dead, Beeman!

Beeman! Beeman!

I swear to...

How'd you even do that?

Those are good.

Ah... sugar snaps.

Yes.

I knew you'd like it.

Just don't tell my dad, okay?

It's our secret.

Why'd you rob that bank anyway?

Same reason anybody does.

Money.

I figured my cut'd be enough
to cover Mabel's medical care,

till I could put a ring
on Adele's finger.

Mabel's all the family she's got.

She matters to Adele, she matters to me.

So, what went wrong with the robbery?

It was wrong from the start.

Should've known I was there
only to take the fall.

They told me all I had to do

was crawl through that tunnel
they dug and fill the bag.

Everything else was already square.

The alarm, security camera, loot itself.

See, there was this armored truck
rolls through town

every other Thursday
carrying over $2 million.

Feeding the town, two weeks at a time.

Been that way 50 years.

So, you got caught?

I got out of the bank just fine,

but when I drove to the old
feeder mine to make the drop,

there was this car in the lot.

Place has been closed near 10 years.

Should've been empty.

It was probably just some driver

trying to catch some shut eye,
but he spooked me good.

I bolted.

Probably the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

'Cause now I know them
Stechels would've killed me

the second I gave up that bag.

Here, don't worry about that.

Rematch.

Place has been tossed, sir.

Yeah, probably by Charlie.

The girlfriend's place is empty, too?

<i>No one's seen Adele since Thursday.</i>

Does Levi have any family
or friends we can question?

Man likes his solitude.

What else I don't get is
why he took the boy.

He's already got the money, right?
Why take a hostage?

Are you telling me there isn't
one usable piece of evidence

in that entire apartment?

Not unless Levi's got some cancer
we don't know about.

There's a whole stack of
tumor removal pamphlets here.

Cancer?

Chief Howell, line one.

Marvin, how can I help you?

Listen, do you have a patient
named Levi Barrett

on any tumor patient lists over there?

<i>Now, you know I'm not
allowed to tell you that.</i>

Laverne, it's off the record,
just like always.

<i>Nope, no Levi Barrett anywhere.</i>

What about Adele Fantion?
<i>No Adele Fantion either.</i>

Oh, wait. We got a Mabel Fantion.

Her primary contact is daughter,
Adele Fantion.

Anybody home?

Drop that gun now.

On the floor, now!

The hell are you doing here?

I was just trying to find my son.

You're here alone?

Who else would I bring?

Didn't I tell you to wait for my call?

You think I'm not doing my job?

No, no, no, that's not what I...

How did you know to come here anyway?

Uh, you know, just asking
around town about Levi.

Really? Asking around?

Like some sort of door-to-door canvass?

And what exactly were you
planning to do when you got here?

Politely request that Levi
just give you your son back?

Or maybe you're gonna shoot him first?

Unless you got something else to trade.

That's what's going on here?
You have something Levi wants?

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Just like your dad.
I see that now.

So I want you to hear me
loud and clear, Billy.

Just let me do my job, and
this ends well for everyone.

What's wrong with her?

The biggest thing wrong
with her right now

is how unhelpful that she's being.

What?

One more time a little louder, hun.

Thirsty.

Thirsty.

She's thirsty.

Well.

Why didn't you say so?

I'll get you some water.

Jesus Christ.

<i>Chief Howell? Peterson, here.</i>
What is it, Peterson?

<i>It's about Will Beeman, sir.</i>

<i>We think he's lying about
the shooting this morning.</i>

Go to secure channel four.

Do you know where my son is?

<i>We found the two shell casings
from Charlie's side on 'em.</i>

<i>But one was no where near the other.</i>

<i>We think Charlie shot
Levi out in a clearing,</i>

<i>then walked over to
the barn and fired again.</i>

Making it unlikely that
Levi fired that rifle?

<i>Copy that.</i>

Good work, officer.

Here you go, one glass of
Granville lager at your service.

Where'd he go?

Where did he go?!

It's just up here.

I lost my iPod.
What?

I think it fell out
of my pocket back there.

That's all right,
I'm sure your mom and pop

will swing for a new one.
I want my mom and dad.

You'll get them real soon,
buddy, I promise.

Here.

I barely knew your dad,

but what he did to Charlie this morning,

that's not easy to do.

And he did it to protect you.

You think he can't handle
finding you out in the woods?

Now, as soon as he gets here,
this'll all be over.

It'll just be some cool story

you can tell your friends
back at school.

I don't really have many friends.

Aw. Then it will just be some cool story

you can use to help you make some.

Believe me.

Hey, who wouldn't wanna be friends

with a tough kid like you?

And, uh, look.

There's my bunker.

Where?

Exactly.

Oh, here, sit down, Danny.

Fuck!

Drop that bag!

Are you kidding me?

Drop that bag.
You're under arrest.

Oh, yeah, what for?

For murdering an officer of the law.

And aiding a bank heist, you idiot!

Aw, man, you got this all wrong.

All right, I know this
doesn't look good,

but I can explain, all right?

Yeah.

All right, it's true.

I killed Charlie Stechel.
It was self-defense.

I was just trying to protect my son.

We saw him shoot Levi without
provocation, all right?

And then he turned on me and Danny,
he was gonna kill us!

And I'm pretty sure
that Charlie and Richie

did the bank job with Levi.

Shut up. Highly unlikely, Billy.

The Stechel brothers are
two of my finest officers.

Yeah, well, there's
no other explanation for

why they were all out
in the woods like that.

Yes, I'll be sure to look into
it as soon as this is all over.

What is this?
This looks like a rendezvous map.

No, it's not like that, all right?

Look, Levi told me to come here,
and to get the money for him,

and... and... and he insist
that I not tell the cops,

what was I supposed to do?
Tell the cops!

Come on, man.

Why would you even attempt
something like this?

I didn't attempt anything, all right?

I'm just trying to get
my son back alive.

What is it? You need a new rush?

You're not listening.
Levi Barrett took my son

because his accomplices,
your fucking officers,

were gonna kill him.

All right, now I'm begging you,

that money is the only way
to get Danny back.

Why don't you just pay him
out of your own pocket?

Because that's not what he asked for,
this isn't a normal ransom situation.

Of course not, you'd rather
give him other people's money.

Just let me take this money
and go get my kid.

Please. And then once he's safe,

you can do whatever you want
with Levi Barrett.

Hey, hey, hey!
You do not call the shots.

You ready to get your son?

You're not taking me in?

Levi's expecting you this morning.

The longer we wait,
the more suspicious he becomes.

He'll think either you're not coming,

or you went to the police.

You're just gonna do
this alone, no back up?

I got you and the money.
What else do I need?

Let's go.

I don't blame you for not grabbing 'em.

Never easy being the one
holding all the cards.

You're lucky I didn't run away.

Where would you have gone?
We're miles from anywhere, kid?

My back.

Here, why don't you go
grab us some firewood.

I packed breakfast.

Laura!

Laura, honey, breakfast is ready!

Laura?

Lau...?

Hello?

She what?

I'll be right there.

So this is where Levi hid all that time?

We combed this area a dozen times.

You know the story?

He sat up there close to a half a year.

Got me all kinds of bad press,

nearly had the town rooting for him.

Truth is, I enjoyed every minute of it.

Exhilaration, tracking your prey.

Hemingway said it best.

"There is no hunting
like the hunting of man."

I guess maybe you got a
little taste of that now, huh?

After killing Charlie.

Fuckin' ay.

Richie, this is Tom, come in, over.

<i>Stechel, what's your 20?</i>

Shut up, bitch!

<i>Richie, this is Tom, come in, over.</i>

What were you and your dad
doing out in the woods anyway?

Took me on a hunting trip.

Whitetail.

Ah. You wanted to be
a big man hunter, huh?

No.

Well.

Why was he teaching you?

Oh, little city boy and
his son bonding, huh?

There's this kid at school
that keeps beating me up,

and he thought that hunting
would... I don't know.

I tried to tell him
it was a stupid idea,

but he wouldn't listen.

Well.

Especially since you
already got what it takes

to handle a bully.

It's true.

See, bullies are about
one thing, intimidation.

And they feed off fear.

You take that away from 'em,
you stop 'em cold.

And I seen you not be
intimidated in spades.

You know when you're
playing your video games

and you're fully into it and
focused, ready for anything?

It's like you're outside of yourself,

but in control of this warrior.

That's the attitude you gotta
give a bully. Completely still.

In your mind, you're able to
change what's about to happen.

In your heart, there's no fear.

There is nothing he can do to
you that you can't overcome.

You stare at him,
think you're unstoppable.

You shake your head.

No more.

That'll back 'em down,
99 times out of 100.

What about that one time it doesn't?

Well.

In that case, son, you just
hit 'em with all you got.

Or run.

Hey, no shame in either.

Just like you did with Charlie,
before you threw that key.

Yeah, something like that.

Danny.

I'm sorry I put you through all this.

It's okay.

You remind me of him.

I always liked your pop.

Your mom, too.

Very special woman, your mom.

I think about her sometimes.

When I was young, I remember thinking

I was gonna grow old with these people.

Jesus.

Now, here I am, about to retire,

and I feel like...
Like it's a different life.

It's tragic what happened that day.

I couldn't believe when
I came around that bend

and saw him at the bottom
of that ravine.

I scrambled down the cliff
as fast as I could.

I thought you heard him fall.

His yell, that's what
it said in the paper,

that's what Dottie told me.

Good memory.

I guess you're right.

It's been a long time since
I thought about that day.

All I'm trying to say is, you were...

You were just lucky to
have really good parents.

Yeah, well, I just wish
I'd gotten to know him

as well as you had.

What are you waiting for?

Geez, where is she with that firewood?

You know, I also brought some of this.

Who doesn't love those
little marshmallows?

<i>Levi!</i>

It's Will Beeman!

Come on.

It's all here!

You come alone?

Yeah.

You got the money?

I got your money, you got my son?

Should we let him in?
Yeah!

I'm coming in.

That full?
It's all here.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry, kiddo.

Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

No, no, no.

He's not the real robber, Dad.

Well, he is, but...
I know.

You got the money?

Possibly.

Are we good? Can we go?

Levi.

Any chance I can get my rifle back?

Kinda special to me.

Come on, let's go.

Good luck, Danny.
Good luck, Levi.

Who is that?

Who is that?
I tried.

Okay, you tried?
I tried to come alone...

Who is that?
It's Howell.

You brought Howell?
Look, I tried, all right?

He's behind the robbery.

Hey, Danny, you just stay back there.

The mastermind of
the whole goddamn thing.

What?
I told you not to bring any cops!

God damn you, city boy.

Come on out, now!

There's some bad news
about your girlfriend!

She's dead!

Hey! You hear me?

Come on! It's all over!

Don't do it, man.

Come on, let's go.

Hey, hey look at me.

Danny, Danny, look at me.

It's okay, all right?

Hey, we got this, all right?
Come on.

<i>Give me my fuckin' money!</i>

Come on, let's go!

Let's go!

Let's go!

All right, let's go.

Come on, Dad!

Aw, fuck.

On the ground, bitch.

Ah, shit.

No one can find Richie anywhere.

Laura knew that Will
was at the post office,

which means Richie
probably knows now, too.

So is that where we should go?

No, look, look.
One mile due north of the mill run

and Grugen Hollow intersection,
we go here.

Okay.

How's that?

Come on, Tom, we ain't got all day!

Move it!

All right, here it is, come on.

All right, I need you climb up
there and wait for me, okay?

Yeah.

You're gonna get your
body flat on the floor,

and don't make a sound or move
a muscle until I get back.

You got it?
Got it.

All right, I love you, kiddo.
Love you, too.

Go do it.

Come on, let's go, now!

All right, now lay down.

Okay.

Richie, get that kid!

Okay!
No!

No! No, no!

Room for two up there?

You let her go!
That's my money!

I'm not letting her go!

This is over, Howell!

What are you some kind of hero, now?

I got news for you, Billy.
It doesn't work that way!

See, I know about heroes,
I protect this entire community.

You fucking steal from it.

It's federally insured, you idiot.

The bank will give you
back every last cent.

What's a lousy two million
for all I've done

for the people of Granville?

Now throw that fuckin' bag over here?

Uh-uh. No more.

I'm gonna count to three.

You need to let her go.

You can count to three?

Who the fuck do you think you are?

Now get the fuck out of here before
I put one in your fuckin' head.

One.

I gave my life to this town,

and what thanks do I get?

Two.

I'm gonna put two in her
fuckin' head, right now.

Let's see if you got the precision

to splatter my brains and not hers.

Go ahead, you're a killer now, right?

Since you shot Charlie yesterday?

You got all that juice
flowing through you?

I remember how that felt,
the first time.

Right after I pushed
your dad off that cliff.

Three.

Put the gun down!

Danny! Danny, no!

Oh my God, isn't this precious?

<i>Danny!</i>
I got the shot, Dad.

No!

You know what they say about
women and children first.

Danny, no, no!

I can do it!

Put the gun down, son.

Danny, Danny!

Levi!

Levi, come on!

Danny, Danny!

Mom!
Danny!

Are you okay?

I'm okay.

Oh!

My goodness.

It's pretty exciting, we were able
to recover all the money for the bank...

Why don't you add this
to your collection?

Think it belongs here anyways.

Besides, Danny doesn't need
to shoot anything

to prove how tough he is.

He's already more of a man than most.

You good, kiddo?
I'm good, Dad.

That's my boy.
