NETFLIX PRESENTS


<i>Always looming.</i>

<i>The future, I mean.</i>

["Young" playing]

<i>And then, suddenly...</i>

<i>It's here.</i>


<i>we've been thinking about</i>

<i>since the first day of senior year.</i>

<i>Summer break.</i>


<i>One last chance to not care.</i>

Woo!

<i>- To call it off.</i>
[beeping]

<i>â™ª Slip away â™ª</i>

<i>To get it on.</i>

<i>â™ª I'm here to stay â™ª</i>

<i>To make plans.</i>

<i>â™ª Call me a dreamer
but I'm wide awake â™ª</i>

<i>Or make a plan B.</i>

<i>â™ª The only way to know
where we're headed â™ª</i>

<i>- One last chance to love yourself.</i>
[beeping]

<i>Or to pretend you're anyone else.</i>


<i>â™ª Once when we were young â™ª</i>


<i>One last chance to act on all crushes.</i>

<i>Make a few stupid decisions...</i>

Hey, he's here.

<i>...and go all in.</i>

Oh! Hi, sweetheart.

<i>right?</i>

When I saw you I...


No one ever fell in love
and said that it was easy.

[boy and girlfriend laughing]

So you're planning on staying together?

Well, we know it will be a challenge,

'cause our colleges are eight hours apart.

And neither of us have a car.

We say goodnight every night.


[boyfriend] For sure, we will.
Plus, we have these.

Promise rings.

So it's totally, like, a promise.

Right.

Of course.

Check this out, man.

What's this?

A summer wishlist?

Have you even been watching the news?

How dare you?

This is strictly consensual.


You have a point system.

I assume this ranks by personality.

Obviously. I'm not an animal.

That accounts for a bonus point.

Gisele?

Tom Brady might have
something to say about it.

She represents cougar.

Doesn't have to be her specifically.

So she's representative?

Okay.

Maybe you should just narrow this down

to who might be willing
and see who's left.

All right.

[engine starts]


Do you know how insulting it is

to get waitlisted at your backup school?

It's like the biggest weirdo in school,

that guy who wears a cape,

saying he's not sure
if he wants you to blow him.

And you're like,
"Dude, you wear a fucking cape!"

the whole personal assistant thing

could be a career path.

But she has a kid.

And I hate kids.


I give up!

I mean... what are you supposed
to wearÂ to a breakup?


and it is empty!


in that Ramsey House.

Didn't they have all the parties?

his stomach pumped there last year.

How do you know that?

the ginormous beer bong.

[cell buzzing]

[Sierra] Paige Wilcox posted it.
[Dad] Who is Paige Wilcox?

[cell buzzing]

give her a phone.

[beeps and bangs]



[Reece] I can't find it.
[Chad] Find what?

Big party. Warehouse district.

I can't believe I can't hack the address.

Right. 'Cause they lost the invitations.

Grad week. People really cut loose.

We could have hooked up.


That's a negative.

It's a tale as old as time.

The hot girls will hook up,
because they've always been hot

and dated the guys
who gave them experience...

But not with us?
[Chad] Correct.

And the average girls,
the ones we actually have a shot with,

well, they won't hook up,
because they lack experience.

The ultimate zero-sum algorithm.

Any luck with the fake IDs?

Six hundred dollar PayPal to China.
Nothing.

Can you trust no one these days?

When did it happen, Reece?

When exactly were we designated uncool?

Freshman year.

You got caught reading <i>Harry Potter</i>
at the homecoming game.

It was <i>Deathly Hollows.</i>

I stand by my choice.

Anyway. I bet
that party tonight is totally lame.

[Bro] Yeah!
[crowd shouting]

[Bro shouting] What a time
to be alive, people!

[crowd shouting]
[electronic music playing loud]



Welcome back, man!

What up, man?

Looking good!

Yeah, you too!

Little sober, but I can remedy.
Yeah, for sure.


for that one, huh?

No, I...
Yeah!

I hear she's interviewing people
for this documentary.

You should definitely volunteer, bro.
[scoffs]

I'm okay.
No, seriously!

I hear she's going to USC.

Documentary's supposed to be about a...

A real thinker piece.

Yeah. [laughs]

Real informative.

[cell beeping]

Back here should be good.


[laughs nervously] Oops!

[inhales] Um...
[chuckles]

So I was thinking about what you said
and um...

about how many try to stay together
going to different colleges. It's just...

So high school.

Right. The whole idea
of waiting until August...

A slow death march. [laughs]

S-So, should we talk
about how this will work?

I mean...

Do we still talk?

Maybe not. You know, I just mean...

If we're really gonna do this.

Yeah, I agree.

No talking.
I guess, um...

maybe we could text?

Occasional texts. Okay.

That-That's nice.
Yes.

Um...

What if one of us starts seeing someone?

[chuckles]
I don't have anyone in mind. I...

Alec, I just think we respected each other
when we were together, so

we should respect each other
when we're apart.

I mean, we've been together two years.
Mmm.

Well...

have a great summer.

Thanks.

You too.




Doing the right thing, guys.


I'm proud of you both.

[laugh awkwardly]

Thank you, Mason.

[laughs]
Yeah.


Hey, Juicebox.

Uh, no.
So, I'm Foster.

And I just wanted to say...
No, means no!

Foster.

All right. [laughs]

How you doin'?


Paige Wilcox.

She checks all the right boxes.

Is she on your list?
Didn't even bother.

I'm not worthy.

[sparkling bells]

Hey, stranger.
Hey, how are you?

Good. I heard about you and Erin.

I'm so sorry.
I'm Foster.

Mm-hmm. Um...


Do you wanna hang out?

I... Yeah. Sure.

[Alec] Um...
Now?

Can I just pretend I went to college

and then backpack around Europe instead?

Do people really fact-check resumes?

I feel like that's very time-intensive.

You don't really want to do that.

I'm not saying
I'm gonna put an Ivy League.

Although I could put Harvard
and just test the waters.

I feel like it's easy to pretend
you went to Harvard.

You just have to bring it up a lot.




[Alex] Bring it back in there.
[Paige] It's hard. I drink beer,

[Paige] I don't play with it.
[laughs]




Come on.
[scoffs]

Fishnets?

Wait, you're...

Griffin.

Right. How are you?

Great.

Normal.

Actually, I...


He's great, Phoebe. [laughs]

You know, we were actually
just catching up.

You know, Griffin here, he definitely
wants to be interviewed.

Oh, really?

[Mason] Yeah!
[Griffin] Mm-mm.

No. I don't remember saying that.


Have a different perspective.
You left for high school, right?

Yes, he did.
Yeah, I did.

Cool, we'll reach out. When you're free.

It's Phoebe...
Fisher.

Right. Thanks.

You know her name is Phoebe Fisher.
Blow me.


[Lilah's mom] So the woman at the agency
said you have a car,

which is important because I'll need you
to drive Lilah to and from auditions.

Auditions?

Well, Lilah has been modeling and acting
for some time now.

You know what they say,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

I was a child actor when I was younger.

Bit of theater, commercial work,

and I was in a pretty well-known movie.

<i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

Wow, that's... cool.

Lilah,

this is Audrey. She's gonna
be helping us out this summer.

Hm.

I'll let you two get to know each other.

So...

So your mom tells me
you're quite the actress.

It's a challenging endeavor.

I'm just trying to hone my craft.

Ooo. [sighs]

So who's the next lucky lady on the list?


Christine Purdy?
[Foster] Mm-hmm.

You planning to attend Bible study now?

She's probably a virgin.

It would be my honor.


[tire squealing]
[Alec] Woe!


Hey!

Grad gift! What do you think?

Oh, man, this is...

this is amazing.

Right? I mean, it was this or double D's,

but I think I made the right choice.
My boobs already rock.

Oh! Beach bonfire party. Are you down?

I... sure. Yeah.

Okay. I will text you the info.

And I will see you tonight.

[engine starts]
[Paige] Bye, boys.

[engine roars]

Does she have a sister?

[tire squealing]

Mom?


<i>I feel that we have
such an opportunity in this...</i>

<i>really connected world
to get to know each other.</i>

<i>Maybe even wipe away some hatred
based on stereotypes.</i>

And what do we have to show for it?

Snap streaks.

Makes me wanna throw my phone
in Lake Michigan. [laughs]

Okay. Final question.

Name the one thing you wanna accomplish
during your college experience.

Yep.

To never have my stomach pumped?


Okay. I think we have it. [laughs]

I feel like that was
utterly unremarkable.

You did great.

some of the others.

Ah, nice setup.

Yeah.

the guy who owns the studio.

on my laptop, but

this place has full-on effects,

sound mixing...

I don't really know how to do
some of the techy stuff. [sighs]

Especially the audio.

ProTools, huh?

Yeah. Not my friend.



and bring down the track.

[mouse clicks]

How does everyone knows
how to do this except for me?

about everyone else,

but I've been recording stuff
since I was a kid.

Do you need anything else?

So you're shooting
your film for SC, right?

What?

USC? Film school?

Mason said you were...
No. NYU.

In New York?

NYU of New York. Yes.

Um... I'm not doing it for them.
It's for a festival this summer.

NYU, huh? Lady Gaga.

Oh, please. Did she even graduate?

I can play that game.

Okay. Actors...

Ethan Hawke,

Billy Crudup, Miles Teller.

It's okay.
You prefer directors?

I do.
Okay.

Um...

Spike Lee, Oliver Stone,

Martin Scorsese.

Okay.
[laughs]

Wait, where are you going?

Columbia.

So, we're both in New York.

Yeah.

Columbia.

James Franco...

about Columbia, but...

if I were to attend an alumni mixer,
I may run into Alicia Keys,

Jake Gyllenhaal.

Yeah, no big deal.
And then maybe grab a beer with

Teddy Roosevelt, Barack Obama...

I don't know, Gandhi?
[laughs]

Strong finish.

Well...

Um, thank you so much
for the interview and the...

audio expertise.

Yeah, no problem. Anytime.

Right.

["Clementine" playing]

<i>â™ª Fifty states, 50 lines â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª FiftyÂ crying all the time's â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fifty boys, 50 lies â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fifty I'm gonna change my mind's â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I changed my mind â™ª</i>


Hey.
Hey!

Hey, look, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to, uh...

to hang out.

I mean, it could be now.

Just in general. Flexible.

Griffin, that's so sweet. Um...

I just can't.

I'm spending this summer
just focusing on my film.

[Phoebe] You know?
Yeah.

[Phoebe] It's not rally...
I totally understand,

I just thought I'd ask.

It's not an excuse. I just...
[Griffin] Yeah.

Okay.

<i>Doors closing.</i>


<i>â™ª Wasted â™ª</i>


that an unnamed organicÂ orange juice
account is about to be in play.

Print, TV, and social media.


[man] I expect you to be eating,
Excuse me.

...sleeping, and drinking OJ...
Sorry to interrupt.

I have a large double latte "NF"?

Non-fat. That's me.
[man 2]Â Wait!

[man 2] That could be me. No foam?

You know, we'll come back to that one.

How about a small cappuccino, bone dry?
Right here.

Soy, right?

Yes. Soy.

For sure.

Um... Black coffee?

Just plain black coffee?


All right, mine's easy.

Large iced coffee?



Brianna Jenkins?

[cell beeps]

[woman] Come on in.
[Brianna] Thank you.

Your mom is running late.

Hm.

She says to enunciate.

Absolutely.

And she also said that you should...

"Don't slouch and smile big."

And to make sure to take out your...

[laughs]
[woman] Lilah Norris?

Present.

Hi.

[door closes]

Here's the thing, high school's over.

We can create completely new reputations
from here on out.

Hey, yogurt dorks,
you're out of rainbow sprinkles.

Woe, how about addingÂ some
rainbow sprinkles to your personality?

Look.

I don't think you ever noticed.

No, I remember, yeah.
Sophomore Spanish.

Junior Lit.
I'm always lit.

[laughs]
And you can't forget about history class


He wore the same pants.

Everyday!
[Alec] Everyday!

I was like, are you buying the same pants

over and over again?
Are you washing them?

See, this is why
I've always had a crush on you.

You're so sweet, and you're so funny!

And I never thought
that we'd get a chance to date

because you and Erin were, like,
the perfect freaking couple!

Can we not talk about her?

Yeah. No, I'm sorry.

You and Erin, like,
just broke up a week ago,

and I shouldn't evenÂ be mentioning her,
and... I'm doing it again.

[Alec laughs]

[electronic music playing]

[music stops]

[mouse click]

Hey, Griffin!
Hey!

Back form the gym?Â You got
a pretty good routine going lately, huh?

Yeah.

Just trying to keep up.

Think I'm the last guy
in the weight room without tats.


Hey, I just want to make sure you wrote
those letters to ask for fraternity recs.

Oh! Uh... Not yet, but I will.

You're asking my friends for favors
to help get into a house,

they won't appreciate
being asked last minute.

from some old guy is gonna do anything...

Griffin, it was a letter from an old guy

that got you into Columbia
in the first place.

Right. How could I forget?

You know what? Don't get the recs.

Whatever.

Nice to be home too, Dad.

[bugle playing]

[crowd cheering and applauding]


Woo!

So what exactly does a personal assistant
do for a woman who has no job?

Cares for her child,

alphabetizes her Poe collection,

make sure nothing in her life is dull,
or hard, or slightly annoying.

But at least she scored us these seats.

I could probably get you an internship
at the agency if you want.

I mean, my job is infuriating
and makes me want to cry in the bathroom,

but it looks great on a resume.

Yeah, as great as that sounds,

I can't afford to not get paid.

Hey, Jones, is that a cup you're wearing
or are you just happy to see me?

[man laughs]
That's disgusting.

I'm so sorry, I don't know her.


[cheering, applauses, and whistles]

[bugle plays]

[man over PA] <i>Jenkins off of first base,</i>
<i>and here's the one-two pitch.</i>

<i>- Fastball</i>
[audience shouts]

<i>Fouled off on the left side,</i>

<i>is it gonna stay in for Santos?</i>

<i>He's ranging toward the crowd and...</i>

Erin, watch out!
[groans]

[man over PA] <i>Rookie sensation</i>
<i>Ricky Santos makes a spectacular catch!</i>


[sighs] Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. [chuckles]

I'm really sorry.

I'd wanna take care of the mustard but
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

Yes, go do you.

All right.



I wasn't enjoying
that hot dog or anything.

Please no one even worry, I'm...

<i>â™ª For it's one, two
Three strikes you're out â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª At the ol' ball game! â™ª</i>



Thanks. [chuckles]


If you weren't my best friend,
we could never be friends.

You literally have dates
falling out of the sky.

Come on. I'm not actually
gonna go out with him.

Yeah, no. He's young,

he's successful, and he's hot.

Gross!

Give me that, I'll make sure
it's disposed of.



Enjoy it.
Thanks, dude.

right here.

on every single string,

holding all of them down.

hard enough,

it doesn't quite have the same effect.

Dude! This is a snooze-a-palooza.

I wanna shred the solo on <i>Paradise City.</i>

Well, please,
by all means, Garrett, go ahead.

You have to teach me first.

Right. Exactly like before.

[cell ringing]

From your chick?

What? No.

She's sexting?

Lemme peep that.

[cell beeps]

[cell beeps]

[cell beeps]

[cell beeps]

[cell beeps]

[cell beeps]

Damn it!

Crap!

It was going great.

It was going great,
and I started getting cocky.

I got cocky, started cracking jokes
that clearly didn't make sense

and I made it awkward!


[cell beeps]

It's her!

It's her!



Probably just poor reception.

[car engine roars]

to your sister's rehearsal dinner?

Well, she was your first babysitter.

And she gave you baths.

So she has an intimate knowledge
of your penis.

Terrific. Well, I can't wait to bond
with her new husband over that.

Aw.

We're early,
and the catering's gonna suck.

Oh! Wanna grab a bite?
Sure.

Two buck longnecks, half-priced wells
till 6:00, guys. What'll it be?

Uh... Well... Yeah, I guess...

Long neck.
Preference?

Surprise me?

Yeah. Good for me.

Gotcha.

I almost forgot...

We're doing 10 dollar buckets.

Great deal, Tracy.

Bucket it is.
You got it, sweetheart.

She didn't card us!

I've no idea what we just ordered.

It's the suits! The ties!

We look like everyone else in here.


No!
Yeah...

Crazy day at the CBOE, huh, guys?


So crazy. Yeah!

How did you know?

Most of other traders are already drunk.

Well, I guess we got
some catching up to do.

To our new friend, Tracy.

You guys are sweet!

that everyone else can have a thing like

a capella or tattoo sleeves,

but I'm an outcast at school
because my thing

is Jesus?

I mean...
I feel like I can't even say "Jesus"

without making people uncomfortable.

Jesus!

Jesus!
Right.

Like when I suggested a Bible study
to the guys I bodybuild with,

they laughed at me.

You're a Christian bodybuilder?

You never told me that.

I dabble.


Let's all pray.

Dear Lord,

we thank you for the opportunity
to break bread and share your bounty.

And we welcome my newest friend, Foster,

who has been a beacon of hope for me

amid the confusion
and darkness of adolescence.

[Christine] We search...
[boy] Dude, go home.

You got no shot.

I'm here for Jesus.

Seriously. Give up.

What do you know?

Man to man?

Telling ya. She doesn't even kiss.


[man] <i>What the...</i>
[Walter] <i>Have they called yet?</i>

<i>What the hell is this?</i>

<i>My dirty undies, dude.</i>

<i>Laundry. The whites.</i>

[laughs]
[man] <i>Walter,</i>

<i>I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.</i>

<i>The ringer could not look empty.</i>

<i>The Big Lebowski?</i>


with the Coen brothers.

<i>Fargo?</i>

<i>- No Country For Old Men? Blood Simple?</i>
[chuckles]

You're so full of it right now.

Your IMDB app is literally exploding.

I'm sorry, IMDB?

[European accent] What is this
you speak of?


Like, Dracula?

No.
Let me see your phone.

Hey. No, hey!
Let me see it.

Hey! No! You're in... Hey! Stop!

You're invading
my personal bubble here, okay?

[Phoebe throat]

Do you wanna get some food or something?

I'm sorry, I promised my mom.

She ordered Chinese.

No, it's cool.

I didn't mean to cross over into,

you know, official date territory.

Not that it would have been our first,
by the way.

Eighth grade. Bladeland.

Yeah. You may recall it was retro night.

That's right. With the four wheel skates.

And the disco ball.
[laughs]

Remember they had that couple skate?

And they played, like, a cheesy slow song
and we had to do a lap.

Well, yeah, we did two so I could work up
the courage to hold your hand.

Did you?

No. You would have remembered,
I'm quite the interlacer.

I probably would have taken us both down.

I would have cushioned your fall.

Aw.

Then you left for school.

Yeah. Came home for Thanksgiving
and it's like the whole world here

had changed.

The abyss of high school.

This is me.

I had fun tonight. Thank you.

Sure.

Night.
Night.

So, do you have a boyfriend?

I used to.

This guy named Tyler.

He was kind of a slacker.

Netflix and chill is like
his life mantra.

So why did you date him?

I don't know.

My friend Erin wanted me to date him.

And he wasn't, like, the worst option,
so I guess he was okay.

Why would you settle for a boy
who's just okay?

I don't know.

Nobody has ever asked me that before.


I always get the biscuits and gravy.

Even for dinner time.
[Erin laughs]

Thanks.

So, do you bring
all your first dates here?

Oh, only the ones I land on.

No, this place reminds me of home.

But never for a date.

Mmm, where's home?

Falls City, Texas.

Couple thousand people.
I actually grew up on a ranch.

Wow. [laughs]
Big change, huh?

Yes, ma'am.
[Erin laughs]

Shouldn't you be, like, out with your
teammates getting drunk with groupies?

Shoot, am I late for that already?

Um...

No, I've...

I have an opportunity here

and I don't wanna blow it.

My parents sacrificed a lot.

And I kind of owe it to them
to take this seriously.

You're making it very hard to judge you.


You wanted to judge me?

Not wanted, but expected... yeah.

I mean, come on.
It's no secret how ball players are.

Not a newsflash.

Oh, yeah. No, you're right.

Um... Most of my teammates
are set, you know?

And I am still playing off of
my minor league contract,

so it's just... different.


not my idea of fun.

Well, what is your idea of fun?




Honey baby,

are you almost done?
It's like 2,000 degrees out.

Last coat.
"Honey baby"?

[Paige sighs]
[Alec] Shut up.

Summer sucks.

Everyone's working.
Do you have any suggestions?

You could get a job.

Why?

[Alec] Foster! Bro!
Uh?

The sidewalk!

[nervous laugh]

["Sweet Home Chicago" playing]

<i>â™ª Come on
Oh baby don't you wanna go â™ª</i>

[men cheering]

<i>â™ª Come on
Baby don't you wanna go â™ª</i>

Yes! Yes!

<i>â™ª Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago â™ª</i>

[crowd shouting]

<i>â™ª Well, one and one is two
Six and two is eight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come on baby don't ya make me late â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hidehey
Baby don't you wanna go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago â™ª</i>

[music stops]

[cheers]
[man] Yes!


and then I feel like
they're kind of crossing over,

so, as it fades out,

it might be interesting
to just let this part go like this.

You know, you're really good.

Can't believe you're wasting all of this
to study business. Yuck.

I know, right? Over a safe,
stable career in the arts.

What am I thinking?
[laughs] I'm serious, though.

Did you ever consider
studying music instead?

Yeah, I did. Berklee was my first choice.

Okay, so did you not get in, or...

No. I got in.

I don't know, my dad had
some pull at Columbia. So...

<i>Promise rings.</i>

<i>So it's totally, like, a promise.</i>


I give them two weeks.
Three, tops.

Wow, I'm sure
New York restaurants will rock,

but Chicago owns gyros.

And barbeque.

So true. Lem's can't be touched.

Lem's?

Come on, Smoque is way better.
You're kidding, right?

Lem's is authentic,

Smoque is...
Consistently voted

best barbeque in Chicago.
By white people who work at <i>the Reader.</i>

What?

[laughs]
Okay, Mr. Top Chef.

One of these days,
go get your best Lem's dinner,

ribs, chicken...

Fixin's.
Fixin's.

And I'll get a Smoque dinner,
and we'll have a 'que-off.

[clicks tongue] I don't know, Phoebe.

What?
Well, that's sweet, truly. But

I'm really trying to focus this summer...

on teaching guitar to 12-year-old dweebs.


the thing to do,

but the last thing I want

is four moreÂ years of classes
and teachers and bullshit.

Like, I just wanna start
doing something now.

Like what?

Like...

what I really want
is to have my own reality show.

Isn't there a kind of
prerequisite of fame to do that?

Pre-what? [scream]

Like, prerequisite.
You know, like, fame before the fame?

A real career path...

Boom, my career's over. Reality show!

I don't know why we're doing this.

We have people who...

You don't get the same satisfaction.

No one's gonna clean your car like this.


My friend Jordan just got out of surgery.

Well, is everything okay?

No. No!

Her doctor says she can't unwrap them
for three days,

and no bikini tops for a while. [gasps]

Oh!

Is "ginormous" spelled
with a "J" or a "G"?

Uh, a "G".

<i>in different cities and we were gonna wait</i>

until the end of the summer, but...

exactly what you mean.

Were you dating someone back home?

Yeah, for three years.

We tried to stay together,

but I was playing all over,

and winter ball in Mexico...

I mean, it was sad, but, there was
just no way it was gonna work.

Oh!

Sorry about the truck,

she needs a little bit of attention.
No, it's fine.

I actually like it.


My teammates give me a hard time about it.

But I am saving up for a condo.

And, hey, she still runs.

[kid] It's Ricky!
Look!


Hey, buddy! Nice hat!

Thank you!


That's so cute!
That's cute.

That's gotta make you feel good.

Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy.

Uh... I mean, two months ago I was playing
for the Tennessee Smokies.

Yeah?

And then a guy gets traded,
and then two guys get hurt, and here I am.

I think it's amazing.

I mean, you're 22,

you're paying your own bills,
you have your own place.

I feel so far away from that.

Oh, no. I think you're doing all right.

You strike me as the kind of person
who's got the whole world at her feet.

["Beyond" playing]


<i>â™ª Don't wanna get ahead of myself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feeling things I've never felt â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's kinda hard for me to explain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Her personality and everything â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Brings me to my knees, ooh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She shines me up like gold on my arm â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna take it slow but it's so hard â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I love to see her face in daylight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's more than just our bodies
at night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But she's really tempting me, ooh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Do you think I'm being foolish
if I don't rush in? â™ª</i>

No! [laughs]

[scream]
Hey, hey...

<i>â™ª That the love is real,
that the shoe might fit â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She might just be my everything
and beyond â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Beyond â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Space and time in the afterlife â™ª</i>

That's a big clown.
Mm-hmm.

You sure you don't want a balloon?

I'm... No, I'm good. Not from him.
[laughs]


The place
of the magical finger interlacing.

[exhales]
[chuckles]

Do you wanna do a couple laps?

See if we can stay upright?
Uh... Negative.

No, it's not really good timing
for an ER visit.


Yeah, fair enough.
[chuckles]

We're still on for tomorrow. Right?

Look, if you wanna back out, I get it.

Oh, no. Do not worry, cowboy, I'm down.

Blue chips are ready to run, my friend.

Thinking about lowering
my client's exposure to techs, though.

I don't know, Jerry.

Think you might be bailing
a little premature on that one.

I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

China.

China is a secret?
Chinese teens, man, yeah.

The online gaming sites
are flooded with them,

and let me tell you, those kids,

they can play.

You play videogames online

with teenagers from China?
All the time.

For research.

You know, there are more tech-savvy
young people in Asia

than all of the world combined.

Brilliant.

Thanks, man.

Hey, if you're ever looking,

our company cars are Teslas.

Will keep that in mind.


We should hit that.

Yeah... right.

Those girls are old. They're probably 23.

[Western music playing]

[horse nickering]
[horse whinning]


What do you say we call it a draw?

Nice.

Come on.


Wow!

Wow.

[clears throat]


You that good with condom wrappers?

You okay?

[guitar music playing]

Your mom is at work, right?

Yeah.

It'd be kinda an awkward first meeting.
Shh.

<i>â™ª Untone between the past
that I wanna keep â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With the feeling like I lose
that part of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Try to hold myself together
I wanna risk it all â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'm holding on to you
We've been fall and fall â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I want you by my side
Along the way â™ª</i>

a new low last night.

You know, I was thinking,
I might have been aiming a little high.

So I sent myself back to the minors
to lift up my average.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you...

remember Brenda Bonner?

Brenda Boner?

I hope you double bagged
the groceries, bro.

Okay, get this.

<i>We're on the sofa. TV's on.
Things start heating up.</i>

<i>Before you know it, I'm talking
buttons and zippers flying.</i>

The boxers are off,
and it's game on, finally.

I think I've heard enough.
No, listen up.

So just before the... bell sounds...

<i>I hear a door.</i>

Shit.
<i>- Her mom?</i>

Her dad!

He's huge and he's hammered.

No way!

So he comes stumbling in, all right?
Totally buzzed,

and plops on the couch right beside us.

Did I interrupt a little smooching?

No.
<i>- You are kidding me!</i>

And it gets worse.

So we sat there, under a blanket,

I'm butt-ass naked,

and watched <i>Nottingham Gardens</i>
until he finally passed out.

<i>And get this, here's the best part.
Brenda Bonner, after all that,</i>

she leans over to me, and says,

"Do you wanna go upstairs?"



Hey, maybe it's a sign.


It makes me sad.

["Let's Hurt Tonight" playing]

<i>â™ª When, when we came home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Worn to the bones â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I told myself, "this could get rough" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And when, when I was off â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Which happened a lot â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You came to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and said, "that's enough" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh I know that this love is pain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But we can't â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª cut it from out these veins, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I'll hit the lights
and you lock the doors â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We ain't leaving this room
til we bust the mold â™ª</i>

[music stops]

[under breath] Yes!

Oh, uh... All set for the nine o'clock.

Yeah. The 9:00 a.m. got moved up.
It's over.

They've all gone.
Gone where?

I think to get coffee.



It's just a fundraiser,
so we won't be late.

Be good.

And Sierra, thanks for watching Griffin.

Ten bucks an hour.

Twelve if I have to play with him.

That's my little attorney.

Griffin?

You okay?

Girl trouble!
I'm not having girl troubles.

[door opens and closes]


You have to tell her.
Are you gonna tell her?


Maybe. I...

I don't know. I think. I... [sighs]

I hate that he put me in this position.

It shouldn't surprise me.

Just when things are going right
for the first time I can remember,

he comes in and wrecks everything.

It will work out.


I know you're under the gun
with your film, and...

No, I'm glad you told me.

Really.

The film is the film.

Well... It's turning out incredible.

Really?

For sure.

[clicks tongue] Come on. Flattery will not
win me prize money.

Okay? I need ideas to make it better.

It's amazing, Phoebe.


You might have
to start wearing a beret.

Beret? You think?

Would you even date such a person?

Probably not.


Griffin, I can't afford NYU.

What?

That's why this film festival
is so important to me.

Why I didn't want anything to distract me.

I applied for every loan, every grant...

You know how you just need

one fucking win in your life
so badly you can't even explain it?

So stop being nice
and tell me what I can fix.

Okay.

What are you doing after the summer?

Plans-wise.

Plans? I'm living 'em now, bro.

Actually thinking about going pro, man.
Yeah?

Me too, actually.
The Cubs could use an arm.


Right.

So, what's the deal with you andÂ Pheebs?

You two seeing each otherÂ in New York?

Or is this just aÂ summer fling?

We haven't talked about it yet.

Ah! Keeping the mystery alive.

[laughs]
[Mason] I dig it, man.


I'm having a party on the 4th of July,
you two should definitely come.

What, your cabin?
[Mason] Yeah.

Yeah, sounds fun.

You know, I think you can help me
with something.

I want to engage your mixing expertise
on a littleÂ somethin'-somethin'.

[Griffin] Yeah?
Yeah.

Got this special event on the horizon.

[Mason] Gonna be dope.
Yeah, of course.

Nice, Zachary!

Maybe I've got this all wrong.

and worry about...

Catching a buzz? [laughs]
A breeze?

Hitting my tricks.


Why hurry to worry,

McFlurry?


Woo!

You need more cheese-head, like

[Wisconsin accent] Wisconsin.

Wisconsin.

[Wisconsin accent] Wisconsin cheese
is the cheesiest.

You're gonna kill it.
[laughs]

[Lilah's mom] You guys, it's on!
Come on, it's on!

Oh! <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

Here it comes.

[Lilah's mom] There's Molly Ringwald...

and that's me.
The little girl crossing the street.

Wait. You were an extra?

Lilah...

I was Wedding Girl Number Three.


[car horns honking] [siren wails]



Saw the bloodbath in the market
today, guys. These are on me.

Hey, T, what's the scoop
on those two over there?

Janet and Claire. Advertising, IÂ think.

Mmm.
Oh, God. They saw me.

Probably think I'm a stalker.

It's no big of a deal. You'll be fine,
just be cool, hey, breathe.

[inhales]
Ooo.

Breathe with me.

[heavy inhale and exhale]

Here you go, buddy. Oh, they're here.
Okay.

Mind if we join you guys?

Absolutely. Have a seat!


[clears throat] So...

I'm Reece, this is Chad...

Mm-hmm.
[clears throat]

So what brings you lovely ladies...
Reece?

Chad?

How about we cut the shit
and order some shots?

[knocking on door]

[Phoebe's mom] Hi, Griffin!

I'm Phoebe's mom.

It's so niceÂ to finally meet you.
Come on in.

Hey, hi, yeah...

Nice to meet you... too. [inhales]

[Phoebe's mom] Can I get you anything?

I'm good. Thanks.

You sure about that?
That was a pretty long "um".

We have soda, water...

I'm... really, I'm fine.


So you guys finally met?
And I look like this.

[Phoebe's mom] I just got back
from the gym.

I'm not surprised...
with your exciting dating life.

She's never home anymore.

I feel like she's theÂ teenager
and I'm the mom.

My exciting dating life.
[Phoebe] No, I love it!

be a keeper.

Anyway, honey, Griffin doesn'tÂ care
about any of this.

No.

Okay. Well, that's our cue
to hit the road.

Bye, Mom.
Bye.

at Mason's cabin, like, BYO-Indica?

What's up?

Nothing.

Did my mom say something weird?

I mean, I love her.

She's my best friend,
but she's still a mom. [chuckles]

No, she's fine.

She was just sharing
all that dating stuff, I guess.

Yeah. She always does that.

I mean, talking too much.

But... whatever.

She's in a good place right now, so...

With this guy?

So he's...

I mean, I guess she really likes him.

I mean, at her age she's lucky

to find someone
who isn't like a serial killer,

married or both, so...

I'm like, you go, girl!

You sure she didn't say anything?

No.

I just wasn't expecting
to meet her right then.

You are not good at acting
off the cuff, are you?


Oh!
Like this.

Last call, kids.

Okay, so our firm
is one big popularity contest.

We have the cool kids,
you have the nerds, the...

the outcast.

It's like high school all over again.

I know exactly what you mean.

This guy I was seeing

got a slogan on a bottle of mustard,

and thought it entitled him
to sleep with everyone.

"Spicy goodness".

Two words
and he thinks he is J.K. Rowling.

Sorry. Nerdy reference?

No. Are you a Potterhead?

Guilty.

Okay, I am stopping
this topic of conversation.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

I got a sense of it and I'm drawing
my final conclusions and... [inhales]

Your old boyfriend is an idiot.

I mean... look at you. You're...

Totally hot.

[small laugh]
And smart.

Uh, and stuff.

Take me home.

You don't want to hang out anymore?


You are hysterical!
[laughs]

[door opening]


So, I know it's a shoebox.


from getting something bigger
near Wrigley.

No, it's amazing.



Hm... Decent view of the city.

Pretty cool...

Do you know what the first thing
I noticed about you was?

Your tie.

Yeah, well.
I'm still getting used to them.

They always come out crooked...

["Hold On Tight" playing]

<i>â™ª Whenever it comes I am ready â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause I know
you been through the worst â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know it's dark, but don't you worry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I know love, it shouldn't hurt â™ª</i>

Woo! Hoo! Ha!

Yes! Yes!
Woo!

We did it! We did it!

What are you doing?


Just supervising biological photoshop,

normal assistant stuff.

Thank God Lilah is
at her grandparents' this weekend.

She doesn't have to absorb any of this.


Hey, Erin.
You gotta get a load of these honkers.

No, no. Mm-mm.
I'm sorry, but you have to.

No, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes.

She's totally out of her mind.

Watch this. [clear throat]

Hey, um, Margot?

We're gonna borrow your car,
some Vicodin and your credit card tonight.

You good with that?




Are you still gonna have time to meet
with that college rep? I mean,

it seems kind of a lot.

Yeah, well, it turns out

that the admissions guy from Clarke
is gonna be in town.

But I don't know
if I even want to meet with him.

Audrey, are you kidding?

The only way to get off the waitlist
is to go for it. I mean,

you should be calling every day.

Getting rec letters...

sending flowers to his wife...

Do I really want to spend
four years in Dubuque?

Hurts my heart.

I don't know.

Hey, speaking of hearts,

are we expecting a good season
for the Cubs?

Let's just say,

I am very glad
to be going to school here in the city.

Ooo!
[Lilah's mom shouts] More Vicodin!



Oh, my God, I just peed a little.


You're thinking about dumping her?

We never have anything to talk about.

And why are you trying to talk?

to talk to you and instantly regret it.

If Paige Wilcox wants to date you,

you date Paige Wilcox
until Paige Wilcox is done with you.

Say Paige Wilcox again.

I will if it makes her appear.

So Milo and Lucy totally have
this twin thing going on.

Like, Lucy got stung by a bee,
and I swear Milo could feel it.

And they talk to each other.

No joke. They have conversations.

oh, my God.

They were just chatting
and going on and on,

it was the cutest thing ever.

I'm pretty sure
they were talking about cheese.

So, how do you keep yourself busy
in the summer?

I do driveway sealing.

You know, like blacktop?

It's just a summer gig,
but it's my own business.

Ew, does that involve manual labor?

Uh, yeah.

Boring. Moving on. Hot tub, anyone?

Hot tub, everyone.

[Mrs. Wilcox] Woo hoo!
[man] Yeah, I'll take 'em.



We are on the field! [laughs]

Welcome to my office.
Wow!


Where are you taking me?

Just wanna show you something.

Okay. [giggles]

Come on.


A little scary, but I gotcha.

There you go.
Thank you.

Good job.

This is the scoreboard?

Okay, my dad is going to flip out

when I tell him about this.

Pretty cool, huh?

You threw a picnic?

Little bit, yeah.

Hope you're hungry.
So cute.



Hi.
Hey.

That's where we met right there. Remember?


Wow!

Pretty cool, huh?

Yeah. [chuckles]

You've only been here three months
and you already own the place.

Uh, yeah, at least until I hit
my rookie slump.

Not on my watch, sir.

Well, you know I am batting .344
since I ruined your dress,

so I guess you are kind of
my good luck charm.

See?

[romantic guitar music plays]

[uplifting music playing]

I come in peace.
Hey.

Sorry to ambush you. I...

I sent you texts, but I...
I know.

I'm sorry.Â Things have just been
kind of crazy lately.


Listen, I've been thinking...

and...

the summer is just going by way too fast.

And I wanted to see you
before we both leave for school.

Should I take that as a no?

Alec, we had an agreement.

Then you went and posted pictures

with your new girlfriend
15 minutes after we broke up.

She posted that. I...

You know what? You're right.

I'm sorry. I hated that she did that,

and I wanted you to know
it's nothing like that.

What is it like with Party Paige?

[car engine roars]


[car engine revving]

Hey!

Wait, is that... That's...

I gotta go. But, um...

Have a nice 4th, okay?

What is this?

I got signed to Under Armour,
so no more squeaky brakes.

[Erin] Nice. Can I give this to you?
[Santos] Absolutely. I'll take it.

[Erin] Very nice. I really like it.
[Santos] Kinda cool, huh?

than the last car.

[car engine roars]

Happy Independence Day.



One, two, three!

Woo!

[girl] Yeah!
[boy] Go get 'em, man!

Yeah!

[yells]
[Mason] Woo!

Yes!

Woo!

[teens yell]



Mm-mm.

[girl 1]Â Hi!
[girl 2] Oh, my God!

They are perfection! Can I feel?
Sure.

Oh, my God!

That's my kind of ilk.

The dude that I told you about.
He's hot for you.

Right?


Three million people
all trying to get ahead of each other.

Everyone fighting for the same spot.

I guess I never really thought of it
like that.

Yeah, that's because

you cutthroat traders

are too busy pillaging
your way to the top.


You're the first guy I've met here
who I don't feel has a secret agenda.

Quick pit stop
before we head to the fireworks?

For sure. [laughs]

I'm sorry. Is this Chicago,
or is this Heaven?

No, dude. We gotta tell 'em.

Claire wants me to have lunch with her dad
who's a big honcho at Morgan Stanley.

Wear the yellow tie. Says old school.

Dude, I'm not kidding.

Chad, remember...

in a few weeks we're leaving for college.

And the girls?

They move on to some workforce douchebags
way worse than we are.

[indistinct voices]


[explosions and screams]


Seriously?
[boy] Woo!


You wanna...

Yeah.


I bet you had to fight off all the girls
with a stick this summer.


Actually, you might be surprised.

Really?

I was thinking...

why we don't go find our own spot

and make our own fireworks?

So you can tell me where I rank!

Wait. What?

Let me just publicly declare

that I'm not the next fool
to fallfor this idiot's hook-up list.


It's gone viral, douchebag!

No one is gonna sleep with you.

Ever.

Ew!
Ah!

[girl] Jerk!
Ah!


Just like you someday.

I don't know.

What? You're so talented.

You'll at least have a lot of choices.

Well.

I mean, you will too, Audrey.

Have you heard back from that college?

Nah.

Still just waiting around
for the low-hanging fruit.

Wait.

College has fruit?


It's an expression.

I've been settling for anything
that's left on the tree.

My ex.

My college. This job.

Wait.

Why would you ever
just settle for anything?

And what do you mean, this job?


No, I mean, you're really good at it.

And you're like my favorite person
that's ever worked for my mom.

And there's been more than I can count.

I am?

Yeah, [laughs] you are.

Yeah, well, I mean, I am pretty awesome.

[fireworks explosion]
[Audrey sighs]

Look, they're starting!


They look so close! Whoa!

Wow.
Yeah.


I can't imagine what that party
is looking like now.

Yup. [laughs]

I'd much prefer doing something like this.

I think I've always sort of been
an outsider on the inside.

You know?

Sometimes I feel like...

I'm floating over my body,
like, watching my interactions.


I feel it too.

Like, my dad's not in the picture, and...

I think I handle it better
because I feel it less.

Sometimes I...

fear...

whether I'm...

even capable of love.

Or if I'm just destinedÂ to observe it
for the rest of my life.

You know what I mean?

I wish I felt less sometimes.

But I don't think
you need to worry about it.

No, I just... I worry...

if I've never been able

to fully let my guard down with someone,

maybe I'm not capable.

Look, Phoebe.

I'm gonna be real honest with you.

I would like to be that person.

And I love...

that you are
a way-too-wise-for-your-years artist.

And that you look like an angel,

a sex goddess,

and a nerdy librarian,
all at the same moment.

Not that you look
like a librarian, or a nerd.

I love nerds.

Not in a weird way.
[chuckles]

Phoebe.

There's something I have to tell you.

I'm listening.

I can't tell you while you're kissing me.

I'm not very good at taking direction.

What do you wanna tell me?


I don't know.
I just... I have to tell you that...

I'm so embarassingly in love with you.


I'm right here.

[crickets chirping]



It looks like it's all gone.



[Erin] I think so.
[Santos] Oh yeah.

[Erin] It's so beautiful here.
Yeah.

Yeah, this place is great.

Thanks for helping me find it.
You're welcome.

And this barbecue that you did
was first class.

The last one that I hosted
had plastic chairs and a pig roast.

I know what you mean. [laughs]

I'm used to parties
where people are taking shots and...

throwing up everywhere.
Ew.

Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

The guys on the team enjoyed
seeing you here tonight.

Mm-mm.

I told them to get used to it.

You're gonna lose. [laughs]
Oh, my... [laughs] Oh, my God!

Big fail.

You are not gonna believe it!

I submitted your reel,

and you have a tryout

with<i> America's Got Talent.</i>

[Lilah's mom] But we have
a lot of work to doÂ before then,

so I want to start
full rehearsals this Friday.

This Friday?

But... Audrey and I were going
to the beach. We had a whole plan.

You can go to the beach any day.

This is the big time.

[Lilah's mom] This could be national TV.

[Lilah's mom] So Sebastian's coming over
to work on your inflection.

I think<i> Baby Love</i> will knock 'em dead.

You want me to sing?
You know I hate singing.

Lilah, you have a beautiful voice.

So, unless you have some hidden talent,

like juggling blindfolded,

you are going to sing.

[footsteps moving away]

[car engine roars]

[man on the radio] <i>...and there's a smash</i>
<i>from Ricky down the line.</i>

<i>This kid is unbelievably hot.</i>


I'm rooting against my own team
because of that guy.

He, y bro, which is worse?
My hookup list flameout

or you ending things with Paige willingly?

I'm sorry, bro.
She has the IQ of a toaster.

I can't do it.

This was gonna be the summer.

I'd been planning it for months.
No. Don't sweat it, bro.

Honestly, the hookup gods
are just punishing you

because you were getting too greedy.

I don't know, man...
No, seriously, bro.

From the fat kid in 8th grade

to theÂ jacked badass sitting
next to me right now,

you had a pretty sick run
with the ladies in high school.

Yes. You did. You did it. [laughs]

Right?

Wait...

Wait, wait... [chuckles] what?

You're...
[sighs]

No! [laughs]

What?

How can this even be possible?
[laughs]


You know, I was so busy with ball,

you know, I was traveling every weekend

and had camps every summer,
I just never really...

But I just figured, you know...

This was the summer
I'd make up for lost time.


I don't know, man, I...

I guess that list was pretty lame.

Kinda got what I deserved.


Forget it, man.

All right? Just clean the slate.

[birds chirping]

[electronic music plays]

[cell ringing]

May-sawn!

Griff!

Dude, how's my mix coming?


Dude, I'm working on it right now.

We're sitting at 100 beats per minute,
you're gonna love it.

<i>chillin' out bongapalooza.</i>

Perfect, bro.

I'm stoked. Special occasion.


Oh, hell, yeah. [laughs]


[knocking on door]

Hey, honey!
[Griffin] Hey, Mom.

Oh, you have a friend downstairs.

Cute.

Hey.

Guess what?

You okay?

No, my mom found out

that the piece of shit
she's been dating is married.

Can you believe that?

Oh.

I'm so sorry.

Is this an epidemic?

Like, can anyone be faithful anymore?

You know, my mom feels like
she's been sucker-punched,

and it makes me feel
like you can't trust anyone.

He justÂ seemed like the most normal guy.

Have you met him?
Yeah, once. Why?

No. I'm...

just processing this.

It makes me want to tell hisÂ family.

Did you... talk to her?

No, no. I haven't.

Well, you have to.

Look. We have to talk.

Come on.

Bye, Mom.
[Griffin's mom] Wait.

You're taking off?

Yeah. We're just gonna go for a walk.

It was really nice to finally meet you.

One of the last good ones, maybe.

He always speaks very highly of you.


He's a pretty great one, isn't he?

Okay. Let's not get me too much credit.

Bye, Mom.
[Griffin's mom] Have fun.

Sorry. I shouldn't have said
you have to tell her.

I know it's up to you in your own time.
But I really wanna...

call this guy's family

and just tear his life apart.
Hey, Phoebe.

Look. I know who your mom has been seeing.

What?

The guy from the gym.

I tried to tell you...
What are you talking about?

Is that your dad?

[car door opens and closes]

You knew?

[under breath] My God.
Phoebe, I'm sorry.

I'm gonna be sick, or I'm gonna
punch something, I don't know which.

So when you saw him with the woman,

then you met my mom, you...

So, you've known...
How longÂ ago was that, like a week?

Five days.

So the whole of the 4th of July
together you were lying.

I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you.

No, I should thank you, Griffin.

Because I almost started to let my guard
down for the first time in my life,

but luckily you just ruined the last shred
of faith in humanity I had left.

Wait, Phoebe. Stop! Look...

I get you're mad.

But this is his shit. I didn't do this.

You knew that my mom thought this was real

and you went along and did nothing.

I didn't know what to do!

through this before.

That's not an excuse.

I don't wanna talk anymore, okay?
Leave me alone.

This is spiraling very quickly.
Can you give me one second?

I should have never let you in.
You were a complete waste of my time.

Phoebe.

Leave me alone.

why you go to the gym so much.

Griffin.

Okay. I'm sorry.

I don't know what you know, exactly.

But it's over. I put an end to it.

So you wouldn't get caught.

Real honorable of you. And you're not
even telling the truth right now.

She found out you were married.

Does Mom know?

[under breath] No.

Look,

this is something you won't be able
to appreciate until you're much older.

And asÂ important as this relationship
with her daughter may seem...

Don't patronize me.

And quitÂ calling her the daughter.
Her nameÂ is Phoebe.

And they are realÂ people

whose lives
you just completely dicked with,

same with the people in there.

Quit telling me I don't understand.
I understand perfectly.

Okay.

I made a mistake, Griffin.

It happened and I'm sorry.

But I assure you.

It meant nothing to me.

No shit!

Griffin!

Here you go.


I bet it's a nice day at the beach.

[cell beeps]

"Wedding Girl Three"
is stuck in a meeting.

Of course she is.

And she says to enunciate.




You wanna go make a sandcastle?

Ab-so-lutely.


[dog barking in distance]

Phoebe isn't home.

She doesn't wanna see you anyway.
[Griffin] I came to see you.


So I did nothing.

And I'm sorry for that.

Griffin, this is all still really raw.

I know.

And I get why you bothÂ wanna
lump me in with my dad...

But I am not my father.

Believe me, I know
the kind of person he is.

And I understand how awful this
must have been for you

and how it must have impacted Phoebe.

She means so much to me.

And I know she was hurt by this.

She was.

I guess I just...

I didn't want this to end.

And that was selfish.

I'm just really, really sorry.

[footsteps moving away]

[music playing in the car]


Thanks for the beach.

It was the best day in my summer.


It's really fun
just to be a kid sometimes.

I'm really proud of you, Lilah.

And you know my mom is gonna fire you?


I guess I shouldn't ask
for a letter of recommendation.


No. She's gonna be really mad.

You okay? I can stay and take the heat.

No, I got this.
I know how to handle her.

You do.
[Lilah's mom screams] The beach?

Are you kidding me?

[Lilah's mom] I got you an audition!

Good luck with your interview.

Don't forget you're awesome
and deserve the best.


Where were you earlier in my life?

I was learning how to talk.

[Lilah's mom]Â Next time
I am not gonna hire...

[clumsy voice]Â Go.
...a teenage babysitter.

[Lilah's mom] Young lady.

You are gonna hear it from me.

[door closes]

I'm calling the agency.

Yeah, you're not going anywhere in life.

[uplifting guitar music playing]

Biscuits and gravy, right?

Thanks.

Hey.

Um... Babe, did you order takeout?
That's so sweet.

Did he already pay?


You know what? This one's on the house.

[Erin] Enjoy.
Hm. Thank you.


Erin, wait. That's my ex.

The one you broke up with?


Listen, we were together for a long time.

And we still talk.

And...

things are... um...

[under breath] complicated.

Hm. Right.


Then you should figure it out, then.
Take all the time you need.

[doorbell ringing]


[man] Phoebe Fisher?
Yeah.

Enjoy.

[romantic music playing]

[knocking on door]

[Griffin's mom] Griffin?

I, uh... I picked up
a new laundry bag for your dorm.

Oh, thanks, Mom.
You know, you'd think that...

with you having been away at Berkshire...

that all this goodbye stuff
would be easier.

[clumsy voice] But it isn't.

Mom.

There is something I need to tell you.

[romantic ballad playing]

So, I know it's short notice, but, uh...

my family is renting this place
in Michigan for Labor Day weekend...

Claire...
...it's really gorgeous.

[Claire] There's no TV.
Claire...

[Claire] So at night we sing songs...
Claire!

I'm 18.

What?

I just graduated high school.

I'm not a trader.

what CBOE stands for.

I do now, because I googled it, but...

Was wondering how long is was gonna take
for you to tell me that.

What? You knew?


Oh, please.
You are way too sweet to be a trader.

And that first morning,
your wallet was open on the floor.


Along with your robotics club
membership card.

I had no idea you were treasurer.

Should really lead with that more.

What about all that stuff
about meeting your dad?


And Janet?

She's not pissed
we're just a couple of lying dorks?

Does she look pissed?
[Reece] One more. One more.

Whoever said that you weren't cool

doesn't really know you.

I do.

And this is who you are.

Can we, like, get married today?


[boat horn]

[Mr. Edmunds] To be honest, Ms. Jarvis,
your transcript is very...

average.

Yeah. Well, my GPA sufferedÂ the past
two years because I've been working.

Pretty much all the time.

Oh! In what capacities?

Fast-food joint, coffee shop.

You take what you can get, you know?

Well, obviously,
we can't offer admission to everyone.

And believe me, you would be lucky
to have our institution in your life.

Nonetheless, we do see some potential...

and that is why we are willing
to take a risk

and offer you admission to Clarke College.

You mean I'm in?

On a probationary basis.

What's that mean?
You may enroll,

but you will not be
eligible for campus housing,

the Greek system or student government.

So basically I am shut out
of all the fun parts of college.

Congratulations.

Mr. Edmunds...

I pass.

[Mr. Edmunds] What?

You guys were my last choice and...

I don't wanna settle.

[Mr. Edmunds] You're passing on us?

So, you're left with nothing?

No.

I'm left with me.

Look, I may not know what I'm gonna do,

instead of attending my backup school,

on a probationary basis.

But whatever it is...

the shit out of it.

Thank you, Mr. Edmunds.

Twenty-three driveways
and two parking lots. Record summer.

No doubt. I'm beat.

Hey, you think you can handle
this invoice for me?

There's something I need to do.

That sounds extremely vague, but...


Sure. Go ahead, I'll finish up.

Good work this summer.
You too.


[knocking on door]

So we're all finished. Mrs. Davis.

Oh, not Mrs. anymore. Nicole's fine.

Looking really good.

I've been watching you guys all week.

Yeah.

Um...

So, I've got your invoice.

Let me go get my checkbook.

Come on in. I'll get you something cold.

for something

hot.


[announcer over PA] <i>And here comes</i>
<i>local product, Mason Riley,</i>

<i>who has a shot at the podium
here in his final run.</i>

Woo!


[announcer pver PA] <i>He sticks it!</i>
<i>He sticks it!</i>

<i>You've just punched your ticket
to the fall season tour.</i>

[crowd cheering] Mason! Mason!

[inhales heavly]
Mmm. Are you okay?

Two breakups in one summer,

maybe if I hurry up
I can cram in a third. [laughs]

Okay, but you don't have time
for those childish games anymore.

I mean, you're a college woman now.
[laughs]

How was your interview?

So... big news.

[clears thoat]
Yes?

I'm not going to college.

But I am enrolled

in Teachers Without Borders.

Well, that's amazing,

but you're gonna go
to college eventually, right?

Okay.

I love you.
[Erin] Mm-hmm.

But we come from different places.

You just have to understand

that you've got different opportunities
because of that.

I'm sorry. Are you upset because
I got into my first choice?

Because I worked really hard.

I know you did. And I would never
take that away from you.

Look, Erin. You're gonna be successful.


I just... I need you to not judge
my version of success.

Which is...

not settling for Dubuque.
[laughs]

It's teaching
little twerps English in Borneo.

Aw.
[laughs]

And it turns out...

I like kids.

Mmm. I'm proud of you.

Are you mad at me?
Are we gonna fight?

Uh, no. I love you, like, too much.

-[Erin inhales heavly] Mmm.

[Erin] Hmm...
[Audrey] What?


[Erin] Hm.
[Audrey] Oh, wow.

This is dramatic enough.

Are you sure?
Go! Get the hell out of here.

Okay. I love you.
I love you. Good luck.

[under breath] Thanks.

Hey.

Your parents sent me an invite.

I wasn't sure if I should come.

I'm glad you did.


So where's the rookie of the year?

Ah. Struck out.

[Erin laughs]
[Alec scoffs]

What about Paige?

Turned the page.

There was a better book
out there somewhere.

Ah, what was she, a scratch and sniff?


I miss smart people.

I missed you.

I was thinking...

Um...

maybe we weren't ready to break up
when we did.

Yeah, I think that we thought

we'd make this moment less sad
if we did it sooner.

Yeah, it's unavoidable.

Next week I'm on a plane to Oregon,

and you'll be up in Evanston.

Last time we had this conversation,
we agreed to <i>stay</i> friends.

How about this time
we agree to <i>be </i>friends?

Friends.
[Erin] Friends.

Okay. Walk away. Erin, walk away.

Just friends.
[Erin] Friends!


For God's sakes... Cake!

[crowd murmurs quietly]

Thank you. Yeah. I'm just happy...

Thank you.

[electronic music playing]

<i>to know our future</i>

<i>if we don't even know the world's future?</i>


<i>the only thing that really stays</i>

<i>constant is... love.</i>

[applause and cheering]

Thanks so much.

Congrats.

If that doesn't win,
I say the whole system's rigged.

I know. We'll see.

I'm still pretty nervous, so...

Thank you for coming, I mean, your work...

made a big difference.

Nice crowd.

I don't know half of these people.

[Phoebe sighs] I think Mom just invited
a bunch of randoms she met on the El.

How is she?

She's good. Thanks.

Yeah, she looks proud. She should be.

I really appreciate you coming to her

and what you said. [inhales]
It took a lot.

How is it with... with your parents?

Uh...

My dad didn't own up to it.

I told her. I told her myself.

My mom's a saint.Â They're trying
to work things out, I guess,

but I'm leaving on Friday, so...
On Friday?

I thought Columbia had
like two more weeks.

They do, yeah. I'm going to music school.

What? [laughs]
[Griffin chuckles] Yeah.

I figured if I'm going scorched earth
with my dad, I may as well go all in.

He's not paying.
I'm doing financial aid and everything.

I'm so happy for you, Griff.
That's, that's...

really good news.

Listen, Phoebe. Whether you win
this thing or not, doesn't matter.

You've already proven

that this isÂ clearly
what you were supposed to be doing.

NYU is lucky to have you.

Thanks.

[Phoebe's grandpa] Phoebe! You're too busy
for your grandparents? [laughs]


Congrats.

[romantic pop music playing]

[Bladeland DJ over PA] <i>Come on, now.</i>

Lace up your vintage pair for
our last couples skate of the season.

[Bladeland DJ over PA] <i>Summer's</i>
<i>almost over.</i>

Is that true?

Is summer really over?


How'd you know...
I thought I might find you here.


Thanks, by the way.

It's, um... very thoughtful.

It looks good on you.

So, shouldn't you be out celebrating?

With new admirers and hangers-on?

Who says I'm not?


Wow, look at you!
I know!

So... Berklee College of Music.

Let's see...

Uh... John Mayer.

Quincy Jones...

Melissa Etheridge.

Four hour train ride to New York.

Yeah, so now we're going
to different colleges

in different cities.

I give us two weeks.

Three, tops.

All right. We should call it a day.

So, do you wanna cut?

It's coming!
