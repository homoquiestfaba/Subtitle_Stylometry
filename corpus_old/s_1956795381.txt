I thought I smelled

Call it, Sparks.

This is Little John

First weapons test terminated.

Back up all telemetry

Nice shootin', Johnny.

Thanks, Sparky.

'It feels good, though.'

Moving the capacitor

Really helped fix
the balance.

Always glad to help.

And whose idea was that?

[helicopter whirring]

Let's, uh, take

a closer look, senator.

Bring that video over here,
Burke.

On it, sir.

'Oh, alright.'

[helicopter whirring]

How's the voltage holding?

Solid.

Still got 57.2 megavolts.

Check the amp-curve.

It's perfect.

You knew alloy

Cool, just like you.

Now, what about the data

(John)
'Yeah, it's great.'

Impressive, isn't it?


It's amazing weaponry.

This was maximum power?

Is that what you were told?

Forgive my asking, ma'am.

Uh, what's your

security clearance?

Level four.

Well, then I guess it's alright
for me to tell you

That I've personally made
some adjustments

That increase

the intensity considerably.

That would be
something to see.

Always doing my best in the

service of my country,

Well..

Keep it up,
lieutenant..

Nathaniel Burke, ma'am.

Keep this up,
Lieutenant Nathaniel Burke

And you'll be a captain

in no time.

Yes, ma'am.

(David)
'Senator Nolan, we're ready'

This village

has been set aside for us

as a training area.

(female #1)
'Ammo! Ammo!'

This isn't, uh,

people's rifle.

No, ma'am,
it's a sonic cannon.

It pumps out
an ultra-low-frequency

Burst of sound energy.

Can take out
a whole line of troops.

Without killing them.

Just leaves them stunned.

And you like that idea?

Not killing 'em?

Yes, ma'am, I do.

Set to a higher gain,
it can bring down

An entire wall like that one.

Why not the whole building?

We haven't tested

those parameters.

Everything's set on the street.
Let's do it.

(male #2)

This is Little John.

Get ready to storm the castle.

(male #3)
'Let's get the medic!'

Sparky!



When you managed

to remove the concrete

what did you find?

The senator

had been killed, sir.

And Lieutenant Sparks?

<i>(John)</i>

<i>She had a severe spinal injury.</i>

And her legs had been crushed.

She may never walk again.

I can imagine how difficult

it must have been for you.

Now, we've heard the testimony
that you shouted out

To Lieutenant Burke

just before he fired.

Did you see how the weapon

was calibrated?

Yes, sir.

What intensity level was set?

The maximum, sir.

A parameter that had
never been tested

Or even approved for testing,

is that correct?

Yes, sir.

Burke knew what he was doing.

Oh, is it?

Who recalibrated the weapon?

Lieutenant, who did it?

Burke did it, sir.

[indistinct chatter]

(male #4)

That's all.'

'Thank you, lieutenant.

Thanks for selling me out,
brother soldier.

Out of my face with that.

What you did was foul.

I should bust your ass

for what you did to Sparky.

Bust my ass?

Do you know where I was headed?

You know what I could've done

with those military

You stupid..

Ugh! Ah.

Huh. Hey, man.

<i>- (David) - He's lucky
He just got dismissed</i>

Instead of being sent

to Leavenworth.

It's been a rotten damn deal
all the way around

But you're gonna feel
a whole lot better about this

When we go back to work.

Now, we've got to create
a new unit here and press on.

We got a golden

opportunity here.

"Opportunity?"

These weapons

are far more powerful

than I'd ever hoped.

Come on, you still have those

buildings folded up.

We've created a whole

new generation of weaponry here.

We can't turn our backs on this

kind of potential firepower.

Maybe you can't. But after

what happened Sparks, I can.

Sir.

So what did you say
to the police?

What could I say? I know

those weapons are top secret.

I just wanna know
how they got on the streets.

Well, the NSA tells me

that every weapon created by us

and our civilian suppliers

is accounted for.

I had it in my hand, sir.

What do you think blew over

their squad car anyway?

A twister?

I saw a street-gang kid holding

a USR model 3.5

sonic eliminator!

Hey, hold it, hold it.

Are you on a secure phone?

What difference does that make?

What are we gonna do
about those weapons?

You just calm down, lieutenant.

The NSA is on it.

Hey, big guy.

Tonight's the night.

Stick it in your ear.

How do you read?

Five-by-five. Receiver?

Transceiver. So be careful

what you say about me.

It's good for 20 miles.

And so is this.

(Joe)
'Whoa, you go, girl.'

Wow. Video.


So I can see what you see.

What is this?

A man named John Henry

has just got to have a hammer.

Of course, I designed it

to do more than pound things.

And I did the metal work.

I especially like the shaft.

What?

Look, guys, I appreciate

what you've both done for me.

But it might get

a little dangerous.

I laugh at danger.

I boogie around danger

like a "Soul Train" dancer.


No, no, no, no. You just do

what you started to do, yeah?

Once I explain this to you, I'm

ready for a little field test.

It is time

to make the final piece.

[intense music]

I know you want to stay away

from weapons work, son, but..

Sometimes you gotta fight

fire with fire.

[music continues]


Well, I'll be damned.

John Henry Irons

has turned himself..

Into the Man of Steel.

[instrumental music]

such a good actor.

You think so?

You think he was funny, though?

Hey. Yo, give me the wallet.
Oh!

Let me see some cash.
Alright.

Here.
Break yourself now!

[indistinct chatter]

Please don't hurt us.

You alright?

Can you believe that?

[intense music]

'Not a nice way to treat

Who's that?

I'll shank you, man.

Just give them their stuff back

and we won't have a problem.

I got no problem.

[instrumental music]

Oh, yes, you do.

Surprise.

Whoa!

Whoa! Come on, man,

what you doing?

I didn't do nothin', man!

My God, come on, man.

Hang around a minute.

Oh, oh, oh..

I believe this bud

just been born again.

Please don't kill me.

I got a wife and kids.

Remember how it feels.

Okay.

Do it again,

and that's your ass.

Okay, man.

I'm cool. I'm cool.

Come on, man!


Look at that.


9-1-1 is a recording.

Can you believe it?

No, I... can't.


I think this belongs to you.

Uh, thank you.

Tell the cops
he's hanging around the corner.

And on behalf of the

of Los Angeles

citizens

I would like to apologize.

[music continues]

Y'all be cool now.

Did you see everything?

And taped it,
so you can watch the reruns.

'The audio and video

Your body temp's up a little.

We gotta think about

more ventilation.

I'm fine. I'm fine.

Hey, bro.

Hey.

You told him
about the gang fight

Let's not bite off more than

we can chew the first time out.

Hey, look at this guy.

Let's break up, man.

Damn, hommie,

what the hell is that?

Hey, move out the way, fool,

this is our hood!

Now put the gun down

and there won't be any trouble.

Oh, man, please, I'm about

to smoke you like a blunt.


Oh, do I wanna look?

One of us has to.



Well, I'll be damned.

Enough with this stuff.

Let's get a body.

[indistinct chatter]

Uh, Johnny..

[tires screeching]

What's he gonna do?

Hit us with his little hammer?

Run him over, I say.

Get that fool!

[indistinct shouting]

Sonic is forward?

Yeah, forward.

Johnny!

It's hammer time.



Well, I'll be dipped in shit

and rolled in bread crumbs.

One of Odessa's recipes?

Oh, man.

You should always buckle up.

Let's smoke his ass.

Nah, man, he saved us, man.

No, we don't need no help
from no cop!

(male #7)
'Man, he ain't no cop, man.'



[indistinct chatter]


Ah!

'No way, man.'

'What?'

Go!
What is this?

I'm outta here, man.

I'm outta here!

Go! Go! Go!

Yeah, go, man!

(woman on radio)

'Shots fired..'

You're about to have

official company.

Let's get out of here.

Yeah, come on.

Watch your back, baby.



Yo, son, this guy has got eyes

in the back of his head.

You got it, and I'll be

watching you. Get out of here!

Run!
Yeah.

Good looking out, Sparky.

You be my leg, man

I'll have eyes for you.

[indistinct chatter on radio]

And you've got
more blue coming.

[indistinct chatter on radio]

[siren wailing]

From the south and west.

Got 'em.

He knows a way out of this?

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I'm-I'm sure he does.

Yeah.

Alright, Sir Lancelot,

move away from those weapons.

Get your hands up. Way up!


[instrumental music]

Well, that is way up.


[siren wailing]

Phew.

'I can do this.'

No.

Don't even think about it,

Johnny.

Piece of cake, Sparky.

No, the rangefinder says

it's too far.

'Are you listening to me,

John Henry?'

In high school, I finished

second in a long jump.

You weren't wearing 75 pounds..

Johnny.

Johnny.

Whoa!


Damn fool.

[siren wailing]

That's one for the computer.

[sighs]
Thank you very much.


Yeah. This way. This way.

Martin..

No time to breathe.

Keep going.

Come on!

'Where is he?'

What? Geez.

Ah, we got, we got him.

Man.

Hey, he jumped.

Shoot!

[instrumental music]

A hundred-and-thirty feet to go.

'Hundred. Eighty.'

[line snaps]

No!

Johnny?

No!

Ah!

Johnny? Johnny, are you okay?

'Johnny?'

'Johnny, a-are you..'

Just a little trashed.

I guess I better do
some more work

On the tensile strength.

That's a good idea.

Hey, it's a work in progress.

[intense music]

The cops are right behind you.

[siren wailing]

[indistinct chatter on radio]

[siren wailing]

Whoa, cool.


They're about a block and a half

and gaining, Johnny.

Sparky!

Got a red light, I see it.

I see it. Hang on.

I'm working on it.

(Johnny)
Gotta work faster.

[tires screeching]

[car honking]

[tires screeching]

I still got reds.


Uh-oh!

"Uh-oh?"

I don't wanna hear "Uh-oh!"

'Sparky, come on.

I need help here.'

'Sparky!'

Just kidding. We're cool.

We're not cool. Sparky!

It ain't easy being green.

There.

Oh, Lord,

I'm getting too old for this.

This should close the door.

Yes.


No!

Move that car. Move it!


Should be able to give you green

Oh, really?
Yeah.

Lord, have mercy.

Wow! Ooh!

Geez, who was that guy?

Ooh, my..


Welcome home.

Hee-ha!

Airtech, where the hell

are you?

(male #8) - Right behind you.
We'll spot him.

[helicopter whirring]

[tires screeching]

Sparky, what's up?

Don't you trust me?


[helicopter whirring]

You done good, boy.

What, what, what?

All they gonna see
is a pile of junk!


(male #9)

but a pile of junk.'

'Nothing down here

'I'm heading north.'

Where'd that son of a butt

go?

The Bat Cave?

[instrumental music]


since the Mets won the series

I ain't felt this good

back in 1968. Ha-ha!

'69, Uncle Joe, '69.

'68, '69, uh, all the same..

Man..
That was a long time ago.

When that wire pulled me up,
my heart dropped.

Yeah, and when it broke,

my heart stopped.

Work in progress. Did you see

the look on those kids' faces?

[chuckles] - Looked like they found
Their Jesus.

Excuse me,
but next time will you please

Trust my rangefinder
before you jump?

Boy, you sure are lucky
this is stainless

Otherwise your butt

would be rusted.

I've got a printout coming
so that we can evaluate

All this data.

Sparky.

I don't know what I'd do

without you.


I'm on fire tonight, Uncle Joe.


Well, at least your record's
intact, boy.


Then he came jetting past us

doing, like, 80.

Morning, Martin.

I hear you've become

quite interested

in our new microchip
game technology.

Yeah, that new interactive unit.

It sounds, um, fly. Yeah.

Fly.

Why don't you and I
go take a look at it?

Alright, cool.

So you really saw
that man of..

Yeah, steel. Heh.

Last night.

He got some skills.

And he's a brother.

Really?

You think
he's from your neighborhood?

Well, he damn sure
ain't from Beverly Hills.

Mm. Where exactly

is your neighborhood?


He, he's an

about seven-foot-six.

African-American,

Yes. Very big.

As big as a mountain.

'And he was covered in

Yes.

steel.'

And he returned

all of our belongings. See?

And he was,

he was extremely polite.

(male #10)

'Yeah, he was amazing.'

Wait up for me.
Why are you going so fast?

Alright, alright.

Yo.

What up, lieutenant?

Nice chain. Subtle.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

we getting paid.

Now, what's wrong
with a little flossing, man?

You floss too much, man,

and your gums are bleeding.

Maybe you'll end up

just like Cutter.

Hot dog?

I don't eat no pork mess.

That's turkey mess.

Word?

Singer will pick
you guys upstate

Precisely on the schedule.

How much we give him

A lot. Now, what do you know

about this Steel guy?

Come on, some crazy-ass fool

Never underestimate

your enemy.

And keep your gold
out of sight.

Eat the hot dog,

Yes, sir.

Five nights, and still

I mean, don't get me wrong,

I like having the time

on my chair, but..

Stay on point, Sparky.

Something's gonna pop.

Alright.

[music continues]

Yeah.


[electricity crackling]



Heads up. Something's cooking.

The emergency services

Something is going down.

We're on it.

Proceed.

This is papa bear.

Go. Go.

'Who's shooting at us?'

Oh, no..

Is he okay?

Oh, come on!

We've got company.

[dramatic music]

Now I wonder

who that could be.

Give it up!

Ice his metal ass!


'Go, man, hit him.'
Go outside.

Yeah, read on him. Get a read..


You're too far away
to use the magnet.

The alloy of those guns

is not magnetic.

Who's he talking to?

I'm scanning for it, sir.


Ah!
Hey, man.

Hey, get down. Everybody down!


It's got armor

just like yours, Johnny.

'What's that?'

Yo, it's tear gas, man.

Yeah. Come on. Let's-let's go.

Let's get out.

Come on, let's go!

You're about to get the blues.

Turn left on Flower.

'Better use your deterrent.'

Uh, Johnny, he's closing on you.




Hang in there, Johnny.
Okay, keep going straight.

You'll see the rabbit hole.

'I know you're hurting.

You can make it.'

[siren wailing]

He stopped transmitting

before I could triangulate.

'But I got some parameters.'

Good. Find his home base.

And transmit those video

to the TV stations.

Mm-hmm.

(woman on TV) - 'This was the scene
Moments ago'

'from the LA Federal Reserve.'

'And it's the second time..'

I want some of them weapons.

Yeah.
Alright.

'This video is transmitted

'Ballistics experts are
stunned'

'and they've never seen anything
like this before.'

[speaking in foreign language]

<i>Pronto.</i>

Oh, my God.

You may be steel
on the outside

But you're flesh and blood
on the inside.

Oh, the boy gonna be
just fine.

It's just a scratch.
I'm alright.

Will you cut the macho bull?

You know your rib is broken.

Well, that's tough going,

no question.

But it's just like what the old
John Henry had to go through.

Yeah, and we all know
what happened to him.

He died pounding steel,
but at least

He beat that old steam
drill.

But he died doing it.

Well, I guess I can't argue

with you on that.

Of course, now,
he didn't have you to help him.

That's got nothing
to do with it.

Of course, it does.
Looky here...

Can I have some water,
please?

Water?

You don't have to do this.

They got a warrant out for me?

For the man in steel.

Some of the cops think that

you're all part of the same gang

because you all use

the same weapons.

Somehow they got videotapes

of the robbery.

I think

this.

Nathaniel's mixed up in

I gotta get those weapons

off the streets.

What you've gotta do

is get some sleep.

[telephone ringing]

Rampard Division.

Officer Craft.

Good evening, officer.

Would you like to know
where to find

The fancy weapon that shot down

your helicopter?

[siren wailing]

You are really leaning on him.

I noticed at the mill that

the iron that goes through

the hottest fire

makes the best quality steel

on the other end.

Well, if it ever gets that far.

Why are you pressing him

so hard?

'Cause I love him..

And what he's trying to do.

Same reason I love you, Sparky.

[whispers]
Evening.

<i>Souffle?</i>

I'mma get it right

if it kills me.

What did you do

to your chin, son?

Oh, I, uh,

bumped into something.

So you did.

You see any of that

big old robbery stuff on TV?

On TV?

No, ma'am.

Times is hard on the street.

Everybody feel like they got

this big old black cloud

hanging over 'em.

Only hope seems to be

that Steel boy.


Here's a long drink of water.

Big, tall. Like you.

Kinda tired. I think

I'm gonna get some sleep.

What's that in your ear,

son?

It's a, it's a hearing aid.

You never had

no hearing problem.

Huh?

I said you never had..

Don't you play with me, boy.

Now, I want to know

the truth.

Are you..

[glass shattering]



Doggone it!

Johnny.

Ah!

Get on the ground,
get on the ground

And put your hands
on your head.

Now!
Grandma, what's going on?

(John)
I'm down, I'm down!

This is a search warrant.

John Henry Irons,
you're under arrest

'for suspicion
of armed robbery, assault'

'and possession
of illegal weapons.'

What's he talking about, Johnny?

Sir, this was in the basement.

'Yeah.'

Yeah, he definitely fits
the description.

For what?

To be the man they call Steel.

You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say
can and will be used against you

'in the court of law.'

Number one, step forward.

Not tall enough.

No.

Number two,
front and center.

Got it, man. I always wanted

to be course line.

Put a sock in it, number

two.

You know, detective,

he was very kind to us.

We wouldn't wanna do anything...

I know, ma'am.

But serious crimes

were committed.

'Well, two's not big enough.'

No.

Officer, the man who helped us

was on the right side
of the law.

Yeah.

'And, uh..'

He's not up there.

No.

No.

Alright, thanks for

coming in.

Marcus, come here.

Yeah.

You got a good look at him,

right?

Well, look,
it was kind of dark.

I mean...
Hey!

Get in there and ID him.

[door opens]

[instrumental music]

(male #13)
'Just relax, buddy.'

Okay, Sparky, I'm back.

Why won't they let you
come home?

(John) - 'They're holding me
For questioning.'

NSA is flying Colonel David
in tomorrow.

Well, maybe he can help.

Don't count on it.

Did you check on what I said?

'Find out anything?'

The TV station said
the videotapes of the robbery

Were sent anonymously.

Big-time infomercial.

High-tech weapons
not available in any store.

And if you act now...

How does a buyer make contact?


there's only one way.

In this day and age

The Internet?

Damn right.

We can pick up all kinds

of good crap, not just porno.

Have you found it?

Of course.

But now the bad news.

The big auction is going down
in 11 hours.

They give a location?

Not till the last minute.

Hey, call that detective for me!

Or what? Did you get tired

of talking to the trees?

He's gone to lunch.

Save it for the army, fruitcake.

He's not gonna be
that much help.

Sparky,
I need to get out of here.

We got you covered.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

I've already made quite a few

I'd kiss her sorry

Now, gentleman,

here's the deal.

I can supply you

with weapons like these

on a sort of permanent lease.

Lease?

I buy, mate. And that's flat.

And you're welcome to do that,

But unfortunately, these weapons

are highly-sophisticated

And only I can do that for you.

Only we.

'Hey, mate.'

Sparky, you read me?

Damn, we in deep stink here!

Got that right. Step away

from the truck, old man.

Damn. Damn! Damn! Damn!

You don't know

you?

who you messing with, do

Come here, Lilly.
Yes.

Yes. I owe you a big stake,

Lilly.

(Nathaniel)
'Keep him quiet over there.'

'Okay, you've seen how

powerful'

these weapons are.

But, gentleman, now I have

developed a new weapon

that is five times
more powerful.

(John)
'Only five times?'

What do you got?
A water pistol.

My hammer's got

more juice than that.

I find that hard to believe.

See for yourselves. I'll let

my hammer speak for itself.

Just hit it right there

on the bottom.

Don't turn the red switch.

She'll get too hot for you.

Really? We'll see about that.

I was planning to use you

as a demonstration, anyway.

Killing two birds

with one stone, as they say.

Move it, y'all!

Come on, come on! Go, go!

[dramatic music]

We're airborne.

Be there in 15!

Yeah, well, I hope

you make it in time.

They'll never make it.

If he kills me,
you'll all lose out.

We don't need your help anymore,

except as a target.


The red switch.

Well, you know

I've got to push the envelope.



Yeah, I know you do.

Kill him!

Maybe not.



[indistinct shouting]

'This way, this way!'

Johnny.




Why should you have
all the fun?


Just get out of here quick.

This quick enough?

[instrumental music]


[indistinct yelling]


(male #14)
'Go!'


'Come on..'



Ah!

Get out! Get out!

'Go on! Get out of here!'

Come on, let's go!

Yeah!

Nathaniel, give it up!

First let's see

what's behind door number two!

My new best friend!

Let me go!

You understand, Johnny?

Success has never
been enough for me.

'I need to see my enemy

panic, cower and fail.'

So why don't you just
back off?

Martin and I are gonna take
a little ride.

Guess again.

[Joe grunts]



Help!


Pick it up!

There's no way out!

There's no way out!


Up there! Throw it! Quick!

'Throw it!'

I never made these.

Oh, hey, bend your knees

and follow through.

Come on!

[dramatic music]

Uh..

Yes!

No!


Damn! Ugh!

Never saw my new toy, did you?

Mr. Steel, let's see how

your armor stands up to this.

'You're going
to the scrap heap.'

Oh, no!



Oh, no!


How do we get out of here?

Uncle Joe, here, here I am.

Uncle Joe, are you alright?

Ah..


Go! Come on.

[tires screeching]


Ah! Ah!

Johnny?
You Johnny, ain't you?

Get in the van, quick.

My own brother is Steel, yo!

Yo, I wanna help.

Shut up and get in the van.

Man, I could be Robin.

Yo, I could get a cape.

I could be like Dre.

You could be like Snoop.

You wanna know
what you can do to help?

What? Anything.

Don't tell grandma.

Get in the van, let's go.


We were lucky to get out.

Uh, ma'am..

[helicopter whirring]

Alright, move, move, move!
Move!

[indistinct yelling]

Stop the engine.
Stop the engine.

Out of the car, lady,

and get your hands on your head.

'Now!'
Let's go!

[indistinct yelling]

Break it up, break it up.

Colonel, this one's

willing to talk, sir.

Good work, soldier.

[man coughing]

I'm glad you called.

The SEAL squealed

and fingered Nathaniel.

The coroner is still
raking through the rubble

For his teeth.

The SEAL also gave us

another tape of the bank jobs

showing the gang kid

shooting down the helicopter.

You're in the clear, so, uh..

Keep him talking,

we don't have him yet.

So, uh, why don't you tell me

who you are behind the mask?


does it?'

'Doesn't really matter now,

I've accomplished
all I wanted to.

You won't be seeing me anymore.

Wait a minute, wait a minute,
we might be able to do

Some good work together
in the future.

I might even consider

letting you, uh

use that new hot Humvee.

(John) - 'Colonel, colonel,
Tracing this call'

'is a complete waste
of your time.'

Your comm-data person

gonna think we're in..

Cincinnati.

Cincinnati.

We got him. They're

at a diner in Cincinnati...

Forget it.
'But, sir, I was... '

'That will be all, Nancy.'

'Yes, sir.'

Listen, Arnold, I know

this isn't your real voice.

'Tell me the truth, damn it.'

Is this you, Irons?

(John) - 'Ooh, can't talk anymore,
Colonel.'

'Phone might not be secure.'

I'll be seeing you around.

Peace.

[kids giggling]


al fresco guy anyhow, huh?

Hey, Odessa, just who is this


and sit down.

Oh, Joe, you go on over there

Use your mouth for something
else besides wise crackin'.


Ooh, a-alright, alright.


today's special, please.

Um, grandma, I'll have

Think you need to find out

what it is first.

Lobster served out of the shell.

With sweet-potato cream sauce

garnished with crisp okra.


Grandma Odessa, you are amazing.

No, I tell you what's amazing.

All this stuff we hear
on the news

About that, uh, steel man.

Well, uh,
tell me something, Odessa

How do you,

how do you feel about that guy?

I think anybody

would be mighty proud

to have him in their family.


about that, girl.'

'I think you're right

Now, I have a surprise

for everybody. Ha-ha-ha.

My <i>piece de resistance.</i>

Lay it on us, girl.


'Yeah!'
'It's about time!'

Whoa!

You finally made your

harmony <i>souffle.</i>

Of course, I did.


Hey!
Ah, shh..

Not so loud.

They'll cave in.

Well, ain't that somethin'?

What a person can do

if they really

put their mind to it.

Especially, when you got

the right kind of help.

And I do like those

new wheelchair modifications.

You haven't seen

the best part yet.


'Ooh, look at that.'
'Oh.'

(female #3)
Look what's she doing.


I love it, girl.

So do I.

(Odessa)
'Oh...'


Yes! Oh..
