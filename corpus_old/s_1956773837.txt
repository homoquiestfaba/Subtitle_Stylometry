<i>[upbeat music]</i>

[kids yelling]

[retches]
Oh!

What are you doing?

[screams]
Oh, my God!

<i>- On Nickelodeon's craziest
hidden camera show,</i>

<i>you've seen your favorite stars</i>

<i>get completely transformed,
and go totally undercover...</i>

So good.

<i>- As the most insane
substitutes ever,</i>

<i>all to give kids and schools
the surprise of a lifetime.</i>

Smell like hot garbage to me.

<i>- But get ready
for new footage...</i>

<i>- And the most out-of-control
countdown you've ever seen.</i>

[all shouting]

No!
Malfunction! Malfunction!

<i>- This is the top ten
wildest pranks...</i>

<i>from "The Substitute."</i>

We're gonna be
the brightest room in America.

And lights off.

Whoa.
[munching loudly]

[kids shouting]
Oh, my God.

<i>- Actor and singer Asher Angel</i>

<i>became a smarty pants
substitute,</i>

<i>who knew everything...</i>

Hello, students.

<i>- Except how to teach a class.</i>

You want to see a folk dance?

<i>- And his open-door policy
was outrageous</i>

<i>in our hilarious
number ten prank.</i>

Do you trust me?
Yes.

An open-door policy, right?
Yes.

[kids shouting]

Open-door policy.



â™ª Open-door policy â™ª

Oh, you rock.

You are really great.

Hey, hey, hey.


Do you think--
Mr. Chin.

This is not good.
Who knocked this down?

Maybe I should go, you know?
Thank you, guys.

You guys
were wonderful students.

Hey, open-door policy.

Thank you.
Well, have a wonderful meeting.

Wait.
[kids gasp]


Don't get it in my hair, okay?

[overlapping chatter]


It's just so annoying!

She's going to get fired.

<i>- For our number nine prank,
internet sensation</i>

<i>and breakthrough
pop artist Jojo Siwa</i>

<i>convinced a class
on a field trip</i>

<i>that she was an actual robot...</i>

I can't wait
to show you guys this.

What the heck?
Whoa.

<i>- Despite some
major malfunctions.</i>

[gears whirring]

[stammers]

Sorry. It glitched.

What were we talking about?

I have a question.

I don't think
we want to find out.

Do you guys like to dance?
Yeah.

I like to robot dance.

Engage robot dance.

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

Robot dance not stopping.

System, stop.

System, stop.

Stop this arm.
Somebody, please.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Sorry, guys.

I might need
control pad solution.

Oh, no, oh, no!

Help me get a paper towel!

Oh--I need them all!

I need them all.
I need them all.

Help. This can't get wet.
It can't get wet.

Can't be wet.
I need more.

I need more, I need more,
I need more, I need more,

I need more.
System is wet.

System is wet.

Help!
System, save to laptop.

System, save to laptop.

Okay, good.

Uh-oh.
Why is that smoking?

Oh, my God.

Not good.
Malfunction! Malfunction!

Malfunction! Malfunction!

System malfunction.

Malfunction. Malfunction.

Don't--don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

Don't touch.
This could be very dangerous.

That was strange.
I'm a little glitchy today.

No, but why is it smoking?

I mean, it's done smoking.
I think we'll be fine.

Well, that's reassuring.

I don't like staying
at my friend's house.

Oh, no, no, no.

Cats love the sun,
and lizards love the sun

and I love the sun.

How my skin look?
It look okay?

Ahh.
[kids screaming]

<i>- You've seen "All That"
star Kel Mitchell</i>

<i>play tons of characters...</i>

I actually that.
That's funny.

I'm taking this hair home.

<i>- But when he went undercover
on a nature field trip</i>

<i>as a survival guide...</i>

I think I'm prepared.

<i>- His unusual tips</i>

<i>became a complete disaster</i>

<i>in this savage
number eight prank.</i>

Sometimes,
you don't have order.

You have to use
the rain storm brainstorm.

Sit down, 'cause this
could get a little crazy.

But what's gonna happen?

Oh, yeah.


All right, so you put
this on like this, so...

Can I get some volunteers?

Me, me, me!
All right.

So water comes from the sky.

And who wants to shoot
water at me?

Okay, so go in there.

Get the blasters.

Blasters. Okay, wait!
Wait--oh!

Wait!

Wait a minute.
Wait!


Wait.

[kids shouting]

PC! PC!

Yell out, "PC."
kids: PC!

PC!
It's working.

Okay, I'm hydrated.
I'm hydrated.


Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait,

what a minute, children.
This is survival.

Hands up...

Oh. Oh!


[kids shouting]

Oh, oh, oh.

Okay. You know?

Oh, oh.

[kids laughing]

[overlapping chatter]

All right.
All right, children.

<i>- Coming up,
see where some of these</i>

<i>gross pranks landed on the list.</i>

[retches]
Eww!

<i>- And later,
find out who topped the list,</i>

<i>as our wildest
number one prank of all time.</i>

<i>- Welcome back to our countdown</i>

<i>of "The Substitute's"
top ten wildest pranks.</i>

[screams]

<i>- Henry Danger and "Danger
Force" star Cooper Barnes...</i>

We are going to get
our prank on.

<i>- Got completely disguised</i>

<i>as secret-agent-turned-
substitute</i>

<i>who thought the whole class
was out to get him...</i>

I'm gonna do a quick sweep
of the room

to check for bugs.
Uh...

<i>- In this ridiculous
number seven prank.</i>

Oh, this is nice.
Look at this.

Nice apple.

I like it.
I like apples.

Who brought it in?
You brought that in.

I did not bring this apple in.

This apple was here.

So interesting.
You think I brought

this apple in.
Who said that?

Someone.
[giggles]


It's a good apple.

Which one of you
put the apple on my desk?

You did?
No.

No? Well, which is it?
What's your name?

Jasmin.
Jasmin?

Is that your real name?

Yeah.
Are you sure?

Yeah.
People call me Jazzy, though.

Oh, people call you Jazzy?

Why don't they call you
by your real name?

What do you got to hide?
My name's Jasmin.

What are you hiding, Jasmin?
Nothing. My name's Jasmin.

Charles,
you gave me the apple?

No.
So now you--for real,

you guys don't know
about this apple?


[kids laughing]

Okay.

Eww!

Oh, God.


[kids shouting]

Guys,
ever seen Michael Jordan?

[kids clamoring]

<i>- Smashing the list
at number six</i>

<i>is singer and actor
Johnny Orlando.</i>

We're gonna age you,
so I'm gonna try

a couple noses
on you real quick.

Okay.
Nose is more

and then the rest of the stuff
is more about aging you.

I look like my dad.

<i>- Johnny took the spot
when he became</i>

<i>a super-competitive
gym teacher...</i>

<i>- I am not a gym teacher.</i>

Let's get that straight,
all right?

I am a competition coach.
I teach you how to win!

<i>- Who needed to learn a few
lessons about sportsmanship.</i>

Can I get a "Whoo"?

kids: Whoo!

This is actually
my bowling trophy.

I won it eight years in a row.

I'm gonna be putting this
on the line today.

If I win,
I keep my beautiful trophy.

But if you win
at any point today,

then you guys win it.

[laughs]

All right, this is what
I like to call handball.

You tape the ball to your hand,

and the last one
to get it off, loses.

Never cheated once
a day in my life.

Can you help me out, please?

Count me down.
From three, two...

all: One.


[kids cheering]

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

No!

[kids screaming]

Give me the trophy.
I have to present it to you.

Yeah,
let me present it to you.

Let me just present it to you.

[kids giggling]


You are so mean.

You guys are all cheaters.

[kids clamoring]

[bones crackling]
Oh!

<i>- Our number five wildest prank</i>

<i>was absolutely disgusting.</i>

Oh!

<i>- As comedian
and host Lilly Singh...</i>

A new set of victims.

<i>- Shared some very
questionable ideas</i>

<i>on personal hygiene.</i>

See, now my feet are gonna
get a little irritated.

I feel it already.

Do you mind?
I must really quickly

take my shoes off
for one second.

Don't mind.

No, don't do that.

Just getting little bumps
under my feet right now.


Does that happen to you
when you have allergies?

kids: No.

I just itch my face
'cause it blows up.

I always come very prepared

because I always
have so many allergies.

[overlapping chatter]

Oh, that's terrible.

Ahh.

We're gonna keep going here.
One second.

You shouldn't cover them.
It's a harmless thing.

It's just foot spray.

Would it be terrible
if I ask you to do this for me?

Oh. Oscar!

Would it be terrible?
It's just a spray.

It's just a spray.
It's not gonna hurt you, love.

Just a--just very little.

Very, very little.
A little bit of spray.

A little bit of spray.
Just a little.

Oh!

That's it, that's it.
Ooh, good.

This is it.

All right, one more, one more.

[kids shouting]

Thank you so much.
Actually, you know what?

It's supposed to be for feet,
but honestly,

when tongue also gets
a little bit itchy,

and you can-- [kids shouting]

This is normal.

Trash it all.
Rip it, rip it up.

[kids shouting]
[sniffs loudly]

<i>- Who could forget X-Games
and Olympic gold medal winner</i>

<i>Shaun White winning
our number four spot...</i>

We're about to pull off
the gnarliest prank.

<i>- When he was disguised as
an uptight business teacher...</i>

Today, we're gonna talk
about business.

I like to call it biz for short.

[laughs]

<i>- With some impressive tricks
up his sleeve.</i>

Now, part of business
is minimizing risk.

Again,
I'm gonna put this helmet on.

So what do I--how do I start?

You get it.
I don't want it.

Okay, okay.

Is this real?

Oh, ho, ho!


Oh, my God.

Oh, jeez.


In business,
you gotta try again.

Oh, jeez.


Okay.

Okay.

Okay.
Am I shrekin' right now?

All right, let me try a wheelie.

Oh.

Ooh.

Dang!

Oh, this--I used to learn
this in dance class.

[kids shouting]

[kids yelling]

Let's get radical, huh?

Who cares?

Mr. Decker, baby.

Get rad, huh?

No, please.

Oh, yeah.

<i>- Coming up, who knocked
down the number two spot,</i>

<i>and who blew away everyone</i>

<i>to claim the title
of number one?</i>

<i>- Welcome back.</i>

Oh!

<i>- We've been going through
all the craziest,</i>

<i>most out-of-control moments,</i>

<i>and counting down
the top ten wildest pranks</i>

<i>from season one
of "The Substitute."</i>


[mumbling] Gimme the rest!

Okay, toes on the blue line.
Toes on the blue line.

<i>- When "Henry Danger" star
Jace Norman</i>

<i>went undercover
as a much older gym teacher</i>

<i>who got way out
of his comfort zone,</i>

<i>he fell right into our
number three spot.</i>

[mutters]


Call 911.
Are you all right, dude?

I'm fine, I'm fine.
Back to that line.

Back on the blue line.

Guys, guys,
he needs some help.

Next.


This one,
you gotta go up and over.

Oh, that's pretty hard.
Are you sure you got this?

I got this.
You got this.

[kids clamoring]

Help me up.

Help me!

Sir, sir.
Help me get up.

[overlapping chatter]

Yes!

Yes!

Yes!

[kids shouting]

Yeah!

[cheers and applause]

You're so good at this.

Will you catch me?

kids: Yeah!

Let's go.
We're gonna catch him?

How much do you weigh?

Oh, no, I'm good.
I'm good, bro.

That's all you.
That's all you.

Here I come!

[kids groaning]

911!

Back on the blue line!

I got you.
Come on.

Do you need help?
I'm okay.

Do you need help?
I'm so sorry, sir.

Good job, good job.

You're a good guy.

Art is everywhere,
and everything.

Oh, my God!

We love you, Nana!

[kids shouting]

<i>- At number two, singing
and dancing sensation Ne-Yo...</i>

So this is
kind of a good look, too.

[laughs]

Morning, class.

[laughs]

Whoo!

[shouts]

That's what I'm talking about!

<i>- Was disguised
as a substitute music teacher</i>

<i>who rocked...
[all shouting]</i>

<i>And rolled
right into serious trouble.</i>

[imitating rapid
guitar riffing]

all: [imitating riffing]

L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l!

[guitar riff]

â™ª â™ª

Because the rockest
thing ever is to play

with a part of your body
that you're not

supposed to play with,
like your nose.

All right, look,
I'm gonna show you guys

some real presentation, okay?

If I was at a show right now,
and I'm rocking out.

L-l-l-l-l-l--
And the crowd's going wild.

And you give a little--whoo!

And you jump and you kick!

Yeah!

Can I try?
You want to give it a try?

I want to try, I want to try.

I want to try!

Wait.
That might not be a good idea.

'Cause if you hurt yourself,
then it's on me,

and if it's on me,
I already got priors, bro,

so we're not
gonna let that happen.


Whoo!

[kids screaming]

[kids groaning]

<i>- And now...</i>

<i>- The moment everyone's
been waiting for...</i>

<i>- Killer sub.</i>

<i>- Our number one wildest prank
in "Substitute" history.</i>

<i>- I've developed
some sort of old-timey</i>

New England-type
firefighter character

who is supposed to be brave

but afraid of everything.

<i>- WWE superstar John Cena</i>

<i>transformed into a ridiculous</i>

<i>fire safety expert
at a summer camp.</i>

We're surrounded
by hazards everywhere.

I'm slightly afraid of heights.

[laughs]

All right,
Dotty's in the tree.

Okay.
I'm about to climb the ladder.

Oh, no.
It's a bit of a hazard.

Everything's a hazard, guys.

[sniffles]

Are you crying?
[laughs]

<i>- And it was his demented fire
extinguisher demonstration...</i>

Just 'cause this
is not a real fire

doesn't mean
it's not a fire hazard.

<i>- That totally blew us away.</i>

Anyone know what this is?
It's a fire extinguisher.

It's a fire extinguisher.

This right here
can save your life.

But it's also...

kids: A hazard.

A hazard.
Yup.

Huge hazard.

And you want to make
sure you're in a safe place

and a safe distance from both--

Whoa.
Wow.

So that's an example.

That scared me.

It's usually
supposed to do more than that.

Whoa!

Don't open your eyes!


Your beard is smoking.

Yo, he doesn't have his eye--
don't open your eyes!

Is my face... smoking?

kids: Yes.
Okay, this is important.

Is my beard still the same size?

kids: No.
It is not?

My beard has shrunk,
and my face is smoking.

[kids shouting]


[kids laughing]

So let's review, uh...

What did we learn today?

Please.
Everything is a hazard.

That's correct.
And, uh, I just learned

if you happen to spray yourself
with a fire extinguisher,

it may make you pee
your pants a little bit.

Oh.
Eww.

<i>- Those were the ten
wildest pranks</i>

<i>from season one
of "The Substitute,"</i>

<i>but no episode would be complete</i>

<i>without everyone's
favorite part--the reveal.</i>

Today got a little strange.

You probably have
a lot of questions, right?

Many, many, many, many,
many, many, many questions.

So maybe this video
will answer them for you.

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

<i>â™ª â™ª</i>

What's up, guys?

It's me, Asher Angel.

Hey, everyone.
It's me, Jojo.

Kel Mitchell.
Cooper Barnes.

Johnny Orlando.

Lilly Singh.
Shaun White.

Jace Norman.
Ne-Yo.

John Cena.

You're on Nickelodeon's
"The Substitute."

[kids shouting]

Spartans, let's give it up
for Shaun White!

[kids cheering]

Jojo Siwa!

[kids cheering]

John Cena!

[kids cheering]

Rico and Raini Rodriguez.

[kids cheering]

Was I a good substitute?

all: Yeah!
Did I pull it off?

On behalf of me
and Nickelodeon,

I present your school
a check for--

both: $25,000!

[kids cheering]

The most rewarding moment

is right now
when we can give back,

and I think
that's really important.

[all cheering]

<i>- I'm so happy
I chose this school,</i>

and that they got
this moment of giveback

because the students
genuinely deserve it.

<i>- I have always had an
absolute respect for teachers,</i>

but after stepping into those

very, very difficult
shoes to fill,

my respect for them
has gone up about 75 notches.

<i>- Having fun
is an understatement.</i>

We had a blast today.

It was so much fun today.

So should I hire her?

all: Yes!

Oh!

This is probably
the craziest thing

that has ever happened
to me in my life.

This is the best surprise
of my entire life.

Did I fool you?
[kids clamoring]

This is the best day
of my life.

<i>John Cena's my idol.</i>

I'm just so shocked right now.

[kids shouting]

[all cheering]

<i>- And that's it for our
top ten wildest moments.</i>

<i>But...</i>

<i>You won't want to miss it
when we are back in session.</i>
