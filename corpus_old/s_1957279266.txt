[Little girl singing]

I love everyone in
the whole wide world.

What time are you
gonna be home for dinner?

Probably after 8:00.

I have some leads need I to
sift through for this

arm's dealing case.

Okay, love you.
Here she is.

Daddy wants to talk to you.

Hi, daddy.

I just saw you a minute ago.

I know, pumpkin.

I wanted to call you and thank
you for this delicious lunch

you gave me.

The chocolate chips and
tuna fish were my idea.

Of course it was.

You're very creative.

I'll see you tonight, angel.

Love you. Bye, daddy.

Bye.

He loved the chocolate chips.

Are you sure about that?

Yep.

He said it was delicious.

Look, I said I'm sorry!

It doesn't matter.

I saw what you did.

You think one Rose
is gonna help it?

I just paid five
bucks for that!

I don't care!

Go by twelve more!

Honey, get back in your seat!

Look mommy, a white Rose.

My favorite!

Elizabeth, get back here!

[Tires screeching]

You can't ever ever
do that ever again!

Look at me.

You could have been killed.
Okay?

Okay, mommy. I won't.

You just have to be careful.

I will mommy.

I just wanted to give
that sad man this Rose.

Okay.

This is for you, sir.

I don't want you
to be sad anymore.

Well, thank you, young lady.

Thank you very much.

You do what your
mother told you.

Thank you.

She's a miracle.

A true gift from god.

Due to a prior accident, I
didn't think I was able to

have children of my own.

But right before my husband,
Steve, and I were about to

adopt, I got pregnant, and
this was our gift, our angel.

All children are special, but
some have that extra special

something, that twinkle in
their eyes, that kind and

gentle heart that reaches out
and touches

everyone around them.

That's our Elizabeth.

It's the small acts of
kindness that we all seem to

neglect.

Not Elizabeth.

She was like that ever
since the day she was born.

Constantly on her own
little mission from god.

[ Music ]

I'm home!

Hi, mommy.

Hi, honey.

I missed you.

How did you do on your
spelling test today?

I got one hundred!

One hundred?

That's awesome!

Mom, I played a game of
hide and go seek today,

and Mark played too.

Mark?

Is he new?

No mom, I told you about
Mark before, remember?

He's sad.

Oh, yeah, Mark.

He's the bully.

Was he mean to you?

Well, I asked him if he
wanted to play with us,

and he wasn't sad anymore.

He looks different
when he smiles.

He said he hasn't played with
anyone since his daddy went

away, in a long time.

Anyway, our teacher said we
should look at the moon and

see if the conditions are
just right to see a moonbow.

That would be so cool
to see a moonbow!

Yeah!

Can I get down, mom?

Yes.

You want a cookie?
Yep.

Okay.

Just for you.

There are angels in
the air, there are

angels everywhere.

They protect you.

They respect you.

If you keep the faith, they
will be at your grace.

They may even leave a trace
you may see, or it may be me.

Look in the mirror,
you might even see her.

And remember, there
are angels in the air.

My favorite book ever!

Mine too, pumpkin.

But now, it's time for bed.


Can I spend tomorrow
night at Aimee's?

Mom said it's okay.

I don't see why not.

Yes!

We're going to the fun zone to
ride rides and make popcorn

and stay up late.

Oh, sounds fun!

Just be careful though.

There's a lot of weirdos
that hang out around there.

I will, daddy.

I'm super strong.

Feel.

Wow!

I guess we don't have
anything to worry about.

Big muscles!

Okay honey, say your
prayers and go to bed, okay?

Dear heavenly father, thank
you for my mommy and daddy.

They're the best
mommy and daddy ever.

And please take care of
them since I'm too little. Amen.

Good night, pumpkin.

Hi, Elizabeth.
Hi, Aimee.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

We love having her.

I'll pick her up
tomorrow afternoon?

Sounds good.

Give me a hug.
I love you.

Bye, mommy.

Love you.

You have fun, okay?
Okay.

Bye.

That would be so much fun!

I can't believe you're gonna
go on the roller coaster ride.

I know!

â™ª When the heart
takes heed...

â™ª Like it's never been
hard loving you...

â™ª Maybe angels will sing to the
sound of us loving free...

â™ª And some day all my dreams
will sing me to sleep...

â™ª To the sound of
you next to me...

â™ª And all my heart
takes to you...


[Siren blaring]

Mr. and Mrs. Prince?

I'm Dr. Lewis.

I took care of Elizabeth
when she came in.

When the paramedics
arrived, she had no pulse.

I understand that the
employees as well as the

paramedics did everything
they could possibly do.

So you'll make
sure she's okay.

She'll be okay.

There was nothing
anyone could do.

She's always been
a healthy little girl.

She had an enlarged heart.

These things are very
difficult to identify.

They often go untreated and
undiagnosed until

it's too late.

I'm so very sorry for your loss.

Listen to me.

I'm a police officer, okay?

I need you to go back
there and fix her.

I need you to go back
there and fix her!

You'll fix her!

You bring me back
my little girl!


It's hard to comprehend
the death of a child.

Maybe we won't know the
answers as to why until

our own passing.

But one thing is for certain,
Elizabeth susannah prince was

one of god's very special souls.

So on this sad day, let
us mourn, but let us also

celebrate the life of a
miracle, the life of a

true gift from god.

Why didn't he warn us?

I could have helped her.

Honey, I don't know.

Because she's too sweet a spirit
to be on this earth, because she

has more important
things to do in heaven.

Is that what you think?

That god wanted our
daughter to die?

I don't know why.

I just have to believe that
there's a reason or

I can't move on.

I miss her so much.

No.

I just need to be
left alone right now.

Honey, Julie and I can
help you pack up

Elizabeth's things.

I think it's time.

I can't do that.

We can do it for you.

I'm not ready, mom.

We just want to help.

And I appreciate that, okay.

I'm... I'm just not ready.

I need everything to
be the way it is, okay?

Even when everything's
packed up, it will still be

Elizabeth's room.

And when I'm ready,
Steve will help me.

Maybe you need to do
something to help you heal.

There's a lot of volunteer
programs out there.

You're probably right.

I'll look into it, okay?

We're always here
for you, sweetheart.

We love you so much.

[Thunder crashing]

One of the hardest pills to
swallow is that life has to go

on with or without you.

People are so kind and
attentive at first, but pretty

soon they have to attend
to their own lives.

It leaves you feeling
very alone at times.

Steve has thrown
himself into his work.

I decided to take
my sister's advice.

I've been volunteering at
a local homeless shelter.

Read 'em and weep.
Read 'em and weep.

Four aces. Four aces.

You need to pay up, buddy.

Read 'em. Now weep.

What do you mean
you're not interested?

Hi, frank.

How are you?

I'm good considering
I'm in a war zone.

This guy here, he won't
fork over my cash.

What's his name?

I get them all confused.

Never mind.

Wow, you sure look
great in your uniform.

Oh thanks, frank.

You're sure a sight
for these tired old eyes.

Thank you.

Will you watch my car?

Absolutely.

I'll take care of it.

Nothing will happen to it.

Okay.

You're safe.

Dinner's on us.

Dinner's on us.

You guys have been
wonderful today.


Lady, you got a problem?

No. No. Sorry.

I just thought I
saw somebody I knew.

Well, it's just us here,
and if you don't mind, we'd

like to be left alone.

My name's Laura.

I work here at the shelter.

Are you guys hungry?

We're always hungry.

How about some
food and warm clothes?

What's the catch?

No catch.

Just food and warm
clothes to start.

Well, that would
be real nice, lady.

Me and punkin haven't
eaten in a couple of days.

You okay, lady?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Um, what was your name?

Tilly.

Is her real name punkin?

I don't know her real name.

She don't talk much.

Where is this warm meal
you're talking about?

Follow me.

Hey, Lionel.

Oh, hi.

I just wanted to say thanks
for helping out

with the girls.

Oh, that's what I'm here for.

I'll make sure they have a
room for the night away from

the others so that
they'll be safe.

But Laura, we've gotta call
social services soon to

protect my license.

I know.

But I was thinking we could
hold out on that for a little

bit until I find out why
they're on the streets.

I think that Tilly had a bad
experience in foster care.

All right.

I'll follow your
lead on this one.

You're a godsend.

But keep me posted.

Okay. Thanks!

Something happened to me
today, and I know it may sound

crazy, but I don't even know
if I believe it myself.

Will you just tell me.

Okay.

You know how I volunteer at
the homeless

shelter every Wednesday?

Yes.

And I pay that frank
guy to watch my car.

Yes, I know.

Well, the most beautiful
but strange thing happened to

me when I walked in
those shelter doors.

I saw Elizabeth, Steve.

What do you mean
you saw Elizabeth?

I mean I felt this warm
breeze all around me, and I

looked up, and she
was right there.

What are you doing, Laura?

You don't need to make up
stories to make

me feel better.

I'm telling you the truth!

Why would I make up stories
about seeing our daughter?

I followed her into the alley
where I saw two

homeless girls.

They looked like they hadn't
eaten in a really long time.

Wow.

Boy, that's truly amazing.

I know.

And I could tell that
Elizabeth wanted me to help

them, so I took them inside
and I got them

something to eat.

What's a little girl
doing on the street anyways?

I don't know.

I asked Tilly, and she just
said she showed up on the

streets one day.

You know what?

That little girl,
they call her punkin.

Just like you used to
call our Elizabeth.

Punkin, huh?

Yeah. Punkin.

What's wrong with you?

What's wrong with me?

I miss my little girl.

And here you are making
up stories about seeing

Elizabeth's spirit.

Another little
girl's called punkin.

I'm telling you the truth!

I saw our daughter today.

I see her everywhere I go.

The backyard playing, at the
playground, the grocery store.

Her memories haunt me, Laura.

But it's not her, okay?

So stop it!

She is dead!

Our little girl is dead.

And the sooner you can accept
that fact the sooner we can

both move on!

The only thing I see is a long
road of grief ahead of me.

I don't want to hear anymore
stories about ghosts.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

I'm just probably seeing
something, right?

Wishful thinking?

There's no book on how to
survive the death of a child,

Laura.

We're both doing the
best we know how.

I just don't want
to lose you too.

Hey.

You won't.

Hey, frank.

Hey, Laura.

Hey, don't worry
about your vehicle.

Chief pinky is out there, and
he's watching it while

we're eating chow.

Okay, thanks.

I brought two girls in here
the other day named

punkin and Tilly.

I can't seem to
find them anywhere.

Have you seen them?

Well, they didn't
stay very long.

They were assigned a
special ops mission.

They left the next day under
the cover of darkness.

You okay?

I'm really worried about her.

She's starting to show
signs of battle fatigue.

She'll be fine.

She's just working
through losing her kid.


Stop it!

Girls.

Girls.

Wait, mommy.

What's your hurry?

We're just talking to the girl.

Get your hands off of me.

My husband's a cop.

I don't care
about no 5... 0.

We're taking this little girl,
and we'll be on our way.

You're not gonna touch her!

And you're gonna
leave these two alone.

Or I'll have the cops hunt you
down so fast, your

heads are gonna spin.

I know your faces.

We know your face too.

Remember that.

Hey, let's bounce.

She ain't worth it.

Catch you on the rebound.

Thanks, lady.

They wanted punkin.

I don't know why.

It won't happen again.

Not on my watch.

What are you two gawking at?

Nothing.

Let's get you some
food. Come on.

I don't see the girl, man.

Man, that's because some
nosy broad came out of no

where saying her
husband was a cop.

So we bounced.

Yeah, we're really not
trying to catch no kidnapping

charge, boy.

No girl, no bill.

You're paying full price.

Let's see it first.

Show me some cash.

We're talking some heat now.

Don't hurt yourselves, boys.

Looks good, honey.

What's wrong?

Trust me, you
don't want to know.

I said I'm sorry.

I know.

Then tell me.

I saw Elizabeth again today.

Don't do this.

Told you.

Okay. Fine.

I'll shut up. Go ahead.

It's like she wants me to
help save this little girl.

I was at the homeless shelter
today, and I look up, and

she's standing right there.

I tried to go over to her, and
she led me straight to punkin.

There were some gang members
outside harassing her, so I

asked them to leave.

Wait a minute.

What do you mean gang members?

Like, real gang members.

One of them had a cross
taboo right here on his arm.

That's the gang we've
been investigating.

They're getting weapons.

We have no idea where
they're coming from.

I told you, I don't like
you going down there.

Can't you find something
else to keep you busy?

I handled it, okay?

I mean, don't you get it?

Elizabeth wants
me to help punkin.

Laura, I know you have a
big heart, but you have no

idea what you're getting into
here, what a kid from the

street can be like, how
emotionally damaged they are.

Why don't we take her
to social services.

I can make sure she
gets into a good home.

I don't think
that's the right move.

She's just really scared.

All I know is that Elizabeth
keeps appearing to me and

leading me straight to punkin.

You weren't there, man.

Yes, I was.

1963 I was there.

Hi, guys.

How are you?

Hey, hey, miss Laura.

How you doing?

I'm okay, but I think
I have trench foot.

But I should be
asking how are you?

I'm good.
Why do you ask?

Well, I'm worried.

I think our parameter in sect
"a" might have a breach in it.

But more importantly,
I'm worried about you.

I think you're seeing
people who aren't there.

Yeah, well, so do you.

But I'm supposed
to because I'm crazy.

I can explain.

It's my daughter.

It's her spirit.

That makes sense.

I knew there had to be some
sort of standard operational

procedure.

There she is again.

Wait a minute. What
did you just say?

Watch my car?
Thanks!

Hey, hey, what about us?

Give me that!

Back soldier! Back!
At ease! At ease!

Attention! Attention! Soldiers!

You remember me, don't you?

[Knock at door]

It's Paulie.

Mary Jane, honey, you hide.

You hide and don't come out.

Go.


What are you doing here?

I said never come to my house.

Don't play games
with me, Sarah.

Where are they?

No! No! Paulie!

You remember me, don't you?

I used to know your mom.

Punkin.

Do you remember?

I've been looking
all over for you.

Hey, lady, mind
your own business.

The girl and I are
having a conversation.

This girl is my business.

She lives on the street.

She ain't no business of yours.

I help here at the shelter,
and I'm gonna help

this little girl.

Well, then, you've
done your good deed.

I'll take it from here.

Yeah, it doesn't
happen like that.

Let's go.

Get your hand off of me.

Look lady, I knew her mother.

I took real good care of both
of them before she died.

I'm like a father to her.

Right punkin?

Looks like she doesn't
want to get near you.

This is a bad part of town.

Bad things happen to pretty
ladies down here that don't

mind their own business.

Good thing my husband's a
cop and certain people will

leave me alone, huh?

I know who you are.

Paco told me about you.

I told you not to come
out here by yourself.

Leave now.

You heard the lady.

It's time for you to retreat.

I was just
talking to the girl.

That's all.

Get going.

You better get out of here.

Get out of here!

Where have you been?

I told you not to
leave her alone.

Number one platoon!

I was looking for some food.

I'm sorry, miss Laura.

I'm not real good at this.

Punkin's not used to having
people care about her.

Well, I care about you too.

How did you end up on
the streets, Tilly?

Some bad stuff happened to
me in foster care, that's how.

I ain't going back.

How do you know punkin?

She showed up a few weeks
ago and took a liking to me.

She doesn't say a word.

I don't know where
she came from.

Well, you shouldn't
be here on the streets.

You have other options other
than foster care, okay?

I'm gonna give you
my husband's card.

His name's Steve.

He knows this terrific place
that can help you find a job

and help you learn how to
take care of yourself, okay?

What's gonna happen to punkin?

I think I've got an idea.

Thanks, miss Laura.

You must be an angel.

That's it.

You're my guardian angel.

Everyone needs
one, right honey?

Mary Jane, is that you?

Do you know this little girl?

And you are?

I'm Laura.

I work here at the shelter.

My name is Devine and
I used to know... I mean.

You used to know who?

I didn't say nothin'.

Well, can you help me?

I don't know nothin'.


She sees dead people.

People not even in the war.

What are you talking about?

You know, like in that movie?

She told me so one night when
we were on the

front lines patrolling.

Frank, honey, I love you
but everyone on the street

knows you're crazy.

Gotta go!

People I see are real!

At least I think so.

Hey, coming?

Come on!

Hi.
Hi.

I have a huge
favor to ask you.

Okay. What is it?

I would love if you can
look into punkin's

background for me.

See maybe if she has any
family or why she's

on the streets.

I want to help her.

I need to help her.

Please?

I'll see what I can do.

Just be careful.

And don't get too
attached to this girl.

Okay.

We need to find some more
things out about her, okay?

We can't save the world.

I'm not trying
to save the world.

Just one little girl.

So what else do
you know about her?

I was at the homeless
shelter today, and there was

this slime ball guy that
wouldn't leave her alone.

Did he threaten you?

No. No, no.

Relax. I took care of it.

But I did find
out her real name.

It's Mary Jane.

This homeless lady
named Devine told me.

She's this character.

She pushes around
a shopping cart.

Okay.

I can work with that.

And I gave Tilly your card.

And told her that you'd help
her get off the streets

into the haven.

Absolutely.

I'd be happy to.

What was that for?

That is for putting up with
your emotional wife and her

good Samaritan projects.

I should do that more often.

Yes, you should.

[Phone ringing]

This is mack.

It's Steve.

Hey, how you doin', man?

Well, surviving.

How about you?

I'm okay.

Unfortunately, there's
no shortage of runaways.

Hey, I have a
favor I need to ask.

Shoot.

My wife, Laura, she just
started volunteering downtown

at the homeless shelter, and
she came across this

little homeless girl.

She says she reminds
her of Elizabeth.

Well, I'm really glad she
found something to

make her feel good.

That's important.

What is it you need me to do?

Apparently, this girl
showed up one day and nobody

seems to know where
she came from.

I have a name and a picture
Laura took with

her cell phone.

She looks like she's
about eight or nine.

I need you to find out
whatever you can about her.

Has she been in the system?

I'm not sure.

I think her name is Mary Jane.

People on the street
call her punkin.

It's not much to go on, but
send me the pic and I'll run

her against all my old runaway
cases and see what I can come

up with.

Great. Thanks mack, I
owe you one.

I'll be in touch.

[Engine roaring]

Hey. Let me help you
with that.

Okay. Thank you.

I just got off the phone
with mack over at the missing

children's department.

You have no idea how
much that means to me.

Don't get too
excited just yet.

He's gonna do some digging
and see what he can find out.

Okay. So I have an idea.

Okay.

I would love if we could
start a foundation honoring

Elizabeth, you know, helping
kids and teens get off the

street.

You don't like it.

No. No. I love it.

I'm just... Well, I'm just glad
that you're starting to think

straight now and not talking
about Elizabeth's

ghost anymore.

What's that?

It's a Rose petal.

I found it in my office.

Dig in.

Good job, man!

Watch out for land mines.

Sergeant pinky, keep
an eye out for B.C.

Attention, solders.

You seen punkin
and Tilly around?

Not today.

I think they went on another
special ops mission.

Have you seen your
daughter's ghost?

Not today.

I believe you, Laura.

They all think we're crazy,
but we know better, huh?

Right. Will you watch my car
for me?

Absolutely.

Thank you.
Thank you.

How many times are
you gonna look at that?

Every single time.

Hey, Lionel, can I
talk to you for a second?

Oh, sure.

Today's not your day.

No. But I just felt like I
needed to be here.

And I want to talk to you
about a project I have going.

Sure. What is it?

I'm going to start a
foundation in Elizabeth's

honor to help kids
get off the streets.

What a great idea.

What can I do?

Well, you're already
helping, but I was thinking

maybe we could get the
foundation lined up with your

shelter so they could get food
and clothes or maybe even

anything you need.

Wow, I don't know
what to say, Laura.

The shelter desperately needs
donations to keep

that door open.

And maybe we could have the
fundraiser here,

if that's okay.

Absolutely.

Thank you. I'll get started
right now.

No, no, thank you.

You're a very courageous woman.

And I'm sure that your
daughter is up there somewhere

right now with a great
big smile on her face.

I hope so.

I gotta go.

Thanks.


I can't risk going to jail!

I've got to be here
for my little girl.

Fine! Fine!

Give me my guns.

Give me my guns and
you're out for good.

I promise.

I'm not stupid, Paulie.

Give me the money first.

Punkin!

I told you to leave her alone.

She's coming with me.

No, I don't think so.

She's coming with me.

I already found her a place.

She'll have her own
room, lots of toys.

She'll get taken
real good care of.

Social services is on their
way right now with

a police escort.

Look, lady, I'm getting
sick and tired of seeing

your face around here.

You're interfering
with my business.

And what business
would that be?

Laura, is there a problem?

Yeah. We're okay now that
you're here.

Is social services here yet?

Oh, yeah.

You're gonna get yourself
hurt real bad one day, lady,

for putting your nose in
other people's business.

Well, if it keeps children
away from creeps like you,

I'll take that chance.

Reinforcements are here, sir.

You better leave, son.

We're gonna drop
some napalm on you.

Yeah, what he said!

You'll fry like
a fish on Friday!

If you ever see that man
ever again, you have to

call the police.

He just tried to kidnap
this little girl.

I'll keep a good
eye out for him.

And I don't know where
Tilly is, but will you tell

her punkin's with
me and she's okay.

Well, I'll find her, and
I'll make sure she has a safe

place to sleep tonight.

Thanks. Hey, do you trust me?

Okay, I want to take you to a
park where there's swings and

we can play. Is that okay?

Okay. Thanks Lionel.

Are you okay?

Is there anything I can do?

Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

All right.

That woman, she's an angel.

Sent straight from
general Patton himself.

God rest his soul.

Absolutely.

That's right.

We have a lot in common,
her and I, besides being

soldiers in the war.

How so?

The people we
see, they're real.

It's the rest of
you that are crazy.

I think you're right, frank.


Punkin, I want to talk to
you about something important.

Is that okay?

I had a little girl once.

Her name was Elizabeth.

But she had something wrong
with her heart and she died.

And you remind me so
much of my little girl.

Even though she's in heaven,
every time I'm at the shelter,

she takes me straight to you.

I've seen her with you.

I know you have.

She's an angel.

She is an angel, and she's
your guardian angel because

she takes me to you
when you need help.

I would really like if you
would come stay with me and my

husband until we figure
out what's best for you.

Are you all right with that?

I've been finding
these around.

When I see her.

Her room is so beautiful.

She would have loved
to share it with you too.

Laura, you didn't
tell me we had company.

Punkin, this is
my husband, Steve.

Steve, this is punkin.

Is that Elizabeth's
Teddy bear?

Yes, it is.

Will you be okay while I go talk
to Steve for a minute? Okay.

What's your problem?

My problem is that little
girl in Elizabeth's bedroom.

Geez, Laura, it's like you're
trying to replace her.

That's ridiculous, Steve.

I'm just trying to help.

Well, you should have
talked to me first before

bringing her here.

I couldn't wait any longer.

Elizabeth came to me with
really sad eyes, took me to

punkin, and that same creep
was trying to take her away.

You still should
have warned me.

There wasn't any time.

What do you want me to do?

Leave a little girl
out on the streets?

She's just a child.

What if she runs away, Laura?

I don't care.

I don't care.

I had to try.

Elizabeth wants me to help her.

Elizabeth is gone, Laura.

I knew you didn't believe me.

I believe that you
think you see her.

Okay, well,
punkin sees her too.

And she's always carrying that
white Rose, the same

one from the coffin.

Steve, you know me
way better than this.

That little girl is not
sleeping in

Elizabeth's bedroom.

Fine.

If that honestly
makes you feel better.




[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Hey Steve, this is mack.

Hey, mack.

I found some
information for you.

Great. Let's hear it.

I found out who
that little girl is.

Her name is Mary Jane Monroe.

Her mother was Sarah Monroe.

She was found dead in her home
two weeks ago over

on park street.

The little girl's been
missing ever since.

Great work, mack.

You got anything else?

Yeah, I found her
birth certificate.

There is no father listed.

I went ahead and did a
family search, and I found a

grandmother who is living in
Connecticut, but she's 85 and

living in a nursing home.

She's confined to her bed
suffering from Alzheimer's.

There are no other
living relatives.

All right. Thanks, mack.

You've been a huge help.

You know, Steve, it would
be real easy to

adopt this girl.

Yeah. I know.

Just a thought.

If I find anymore information,
I'll be in touch.

Hey.
Hey.

You okay?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

Mack just called.

Did you find anything out?

Well, punkin's given
name is Mary Jane Monroe.

Her mother was found
dead two weeks ago.

It all makes sense.

No wonder why she's so
traumatized, you know?

Yeah. She also has

a grandmother with
Alzheimer's who lives in

a nursing home in Connecticut.

But there's no other
living relatives.

So she's all alone?

Yeah.

Steve?

I know what you're
gonna say, Laura.

You want to adopt her.

Honey, it's the right
thing to do, you know?

I just need a
little bit of time. Okay?

Okay.

I need to go take
care of something.

Okay.

Hey. I need to talk to you.

I don't know you.

I know you. You're Devine.

I'm a cop.

What do you want?

My wife, Laura,
works in the shelter.

I'm looking for a
girl on the street.

Well, why didn't you say so?

Go over to 13th
and state street.

They've got plenty there.

That's cute.

That's real cute.

Her name's Tilly.

I know the girl
you're talking about.

I saw her in front of
the shelter earlier.

How did you know punkin's
name was Mary Jane?

It's no mystery.

Me and her mama were friends.

I'm the one who
found her mama dead.

I looked for punkin, but I
couldn't find her until I saw

her the other day with Tilly.

I may need to bring you in
for some more questioning,

so stick around.

Well, where am I gonna go?

There goes the trip to Jamaica.

I better call my travel agent,
rearrange some flights.

Tilly, right?

Yeah, and you're a cop.

What do you want?

My name's Steve.

My wife's Laura.

She's a good lady
for helping out punkin.

She wants to help you out too.

There's a place she
mentioned called the haven.

It's a good place.

It will get you off the street.

I'd like to take you there.

It's not foster care, is it?

No. No, it's not foster care.

It's room and board,
three meals a day.

There's always a catch.

There's no catch, Tilly.

But you will have
to make an effort.

It's a great place.

Laura wouldn't steer you wrong.

But you're gonna have
to make a decision.

You need to go.

You can't stay here.

All right, I'll go.

But if I don't like
it, I'm outta there.

Fair enough. Hop in.

Get out of here. Go on.

Go, Tilly. Go.

Well, this is it.

I don't know.

I just... I don't
like these places.

Tilly, listen.

This is a great
opportunity for you.

Don't blow it off.

Do they have good food?

Yes, they have good food.

So I've heard.

All right, well thank
you for helping me.

Thank Laura.

She'll be by to visit.

Okay.

Just be strong.

You can do this.

You have a support system in
place now, people who

love and care about you.

Thank you.

Let's get you inside.

I'm home.

Hey! I didn't think you were
gonna make it.

Good news, ladies.

Tilly is off the streets
and into the haven.

How did you get her to go?

It wasn't me.

It's you she trusts, and she
wanted me to tell you how much

she misses you.

So she's gonna be okay.

She's gonna be
better than okay.

She's got a warm bed
and plenty of food.

I know what that is.

That's a glock 9.

Does that have
fifteen in a clip?

What?

How did you know that?

My mom showed me.

She had lots of guns
hiding around the house.

Glocks, m16's, ak-47's.

Punkin, punkin, do you
think you can show me where

your mom kept those guns?

Um, I don't really
want to go back there.

It's okay.

What if I went with
you and protected you?

Are you sure?

It will be fine.

I promise I won't
let anyone hurt you.

Okay.

Then I think I can go.

All right.

Let's go do some investigating.

We'll be back in an hour.

Grab your jacket, okay?

Be careful.

Will you come in with me?

Yeah. The guns are in
the garage

and I know the code to get in.

Okay. Let's go.

Where'd she keep the guns?

They're in the attic.

Up here?
Uh-huh.

Okay. You stand over here.

I'll be right back.

Stay here, okay?

Okay.

Are you all right?

Uh-huh.

It's Paulie.

Mary Jane, honey, you hide.

You hide and don't come out.

Go.

[Knock at door]

Open up Sarah!

What are you doing here?

I said never come to my house.

Don't play games
with me, Sarah.

Where are they?

It's not how it works.

You give me the money, and the
guns will be

delivered like always.

I hired you to get those
guns past customs for me.

Don't piss me off, Sarah.

This is not working for me!

It's too dangerous.

I want out.

There ain't no out.

I can't risk going to jail.

I've gotta be here
for my little girl.

Your little girl?

No, your little
girl's not nothing.

Look, fine, fine,
give me my guns.

Give me my guns and you're out.

You're out for good. I promise.

I'm not stupid, Paulie.

Give me the money first.

I'm gonna tell you
this one more time, Sarah.

Once! Give me my guns!

And I'm gonna tell
you this one more time.

You give me the money, and the
guns will be delivered,

and then I am out.

It's over. End of story.

Now get out.

No, no! Paulie!

Get up!

Get up, Sarah.

You ain't hurt that bad!

[Crying] Mom.

Wake up.

Punkin?

My mommy died.

I know, sweetie.

Come here.

I'm so sorry.

Do you know who did this to her?

That bad man who
was trying to take me.

Paulie?

Come here.

He's never gonna
come near you again. Okay?

Why don't you
take a picture, pig?

It lasts longer.

You got nothing on me.

I don't even know why I'm here.

Try arms dealing and murder.

Recognize her?

That's Sarah Monroe.

She was only 34 years old.

Don't know her.

Take a closer look!

I said I don't know her!

I've never seen her
before in my life!

That's funny, because I
have an eyewitness that puts

you at the house the
night of the murder.

Yeah, and I got three
alibis that say otherwise.

Oh, well, three alibis?

I haven't even given you a
date and yet you

have three alibis.

You know what?

I'm done answering
your stupid questions.

I want to see my lawyer.

Are we through?

For now.

Get out of my face.

Punkin, we wanted to talk
to you about something.

Okay, what?

Well, we met
with a lawyer today.

Am I in trouble?

No, you're not in trouble.

We wanted to talk to
somebody about adopting you.

We want to be your parents.

You'd be our daughter.

For real?
For real.

I'd like that very much.

And we wanted to see if you
want to keep your real name,

Mary Jane, or get a
completely new one.

A new name?

Like what?

We were thinking faith
Elizabeth because

Elizabeth led us to you.

I like that name.

Then faith
Elizabeth prince it is.

Yes!

But, I'm still gonna
call you punkin sometimes.

Okay. Come push me
on the swing.

Nice place.

Woe! What's the big hurry?

I'll scream.

Go right ahead.

I know who you are.

I know nobody cares about you.

You're a little dirt bag with
no where to go but right back

to the streets where you belong.

Now you're gonna help me find
that little brat punkin.

I don't know where she is.

Oh, I think you do.

I saw that pig drop you
off here the other night.

Get out of here now, Paulie.

Says who?

That would be me.

Never show your
face here ever again.

Do you understand?

Now get out of here.


Are you okay?

Yeah.

What did he say to you?

He wanted to know
where punkin was.

What'd you tell him?
Nothing.

He's never gonna hurt
you ever again, I promise.

How are you doing here anyway?

I'm doing real good.

They treat me nice here, and
I'm learning to type

on a computer.

I never knew learning
could be so much fun.

Well, in two years they're
gonna help you get a G.E.D., and

a counselor will find an
apartment and a job

whenever you're ready.

Thank you, miss Laura.

I'm so glad punkin
has you for a mom.

And I'm very
lucky to have her.

Now we want you as
part of our family.

We want to see you succeed.

I'll make you
proud, miss Laura.

Make yourself
proud first, Tilly. Okay?

Let's get you inside.

Where's the girl, Devine?

How should I know?

I saw you talking to
that pig the other night.

Where's she at?

Leave her alone!

She don't know nothing!

You have no business
talking to Tilly.

I didn't break any laws.

What do you want with punkin?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I'm warning you, Paulie,
you stay away

from my daughter.

Right. Your daughter.

I'll remember to
steer clear of her.

You've been warned.

Hey. I don't want you going
out with punkin

unless you're with me, okay?

Why?

I slipped up and mentioned
she's our daughter.

Paulie knows she's with us.

Why haven't you arrested him?

The case isn't
strong enough yet.

I just need some more time.

But until then, we need you to
keep a close eye on punkin.

Okay. We'll be careful.

I'm gonna go check on her.

Night, daddy.

Night, sweetheart.

What'd you find out?

Adoption went through.

Word on the street, she's
gonna have a fundraiser at the

shelter tomorrow night.

Perfect spot to take her.

Lots of people, very
little security, if any.

You know, if they tie me in
with her mother's death, they

tie me to the guns.

You think you can get out
without getting caught?

I'm a professional.

I want half the money up
front, the other

half on delivery.

Once you have her,
she's your problem.

Done.

What?

You look beautiful,
that's what.

Thank you.

This is a present
for you, mom.

Thank you. I love it.

Let me put it on.

It's beautiful.

Now you can have both your
girls close to your heart.

I've been finding a few of
these around the house lately.

Me, too.
Me three.

Shall we, ladies?

Let's go.

You guys look great.


All right, wait here.

I'm gonna go get this little
girl and bring her out to you.

All right.

Go to the spot we discussed.

Someone will be
there to pick her up.

I know, dude. I got it.

By all means, do
not stop for anybody.

Why would I stop for anybody?

Why'd you buy that hat?

Get the other half of our money.

I'll get the money.

I like this hat.

Laura, how are you?

You look wonderful tonight.

Good to see you.

This is my husband, Steve.

Nice to meet you, sir.

Good to meet you.

Hello, ladies.

Hi.

Hello, soldiers.

I'd like to personally
thank each and every one of

you for coming here tonight
to help kick off the

Elizabeth S. Prince foundation.

This is a very worthwhile
charity begun by a loving,

giving and honest woman, Laura
prince and her

courageous husband, Steve.


If every one of us would
take one lost soul, just one

into our hearts, we would live
in a far safer world filled

with many, many
beautiful people.


I began this shelter 20
years ago to provide as much

help as I could for
unfortunate children

and teens and adults.

Make no mistake, money matters.

Money is the difference
between taking ten kids and a

hundred off the street.

Please, give me a hundred.


I'd like to ask Laura
prince to come up and

say a few words.


Thank you.

First of all, I would like to
thank every one of you for

coming out tonight and helping
us support our foundation.

This is a very, very special
evening for my husband and I.

When my daughter died...

I don't feel very good.

I need to go to the bathroom.

You stay here.

I'll take her so you
can listen to Laura.

Don't take your eyes off her.

the beat of my
heart actually changed.

I knew I had to find something
to keep myself busy as well

as in her honor.

So I started volunteering here
at the shelter, and I came

across a little homeless
girl named punkin.

She's actually here tonight.

She'll be right back.

She had to use the
little girl's room.


Every single time I saw
punkin, she reminded me

of my Elizabeth...

Are you still in there?

I strongly believe that
no child should ever have to

live on the streets, so my
husband and I took punkin into

our hearts and our home.

Punkin?


Punkin has helped
fill all the emptiness.

So tonight, we implore each
and every one of you because

we need your help.

So please donate generously.


Okay, that little
spot we talked about.

Cover her up and
I'll meet you later.

I got it. I got it.

I won't let you down.

Last, but definitely not
least, I want to thank

my husband, Steve.

Thank you for your
incredible strength.

I love you.

I'd now like to introduce my
good friend, frank, who would

like to read something.

I love you, frank!

Way to go, frank!


There was no hope from
whence she came, no calm, no

peace, she had no name.

Only sorrow and pain from
guilt and rain, one white Rose

brought death and change.

The reason to give from one
woman's heart gave a little

girl a chance and
brand new start.

A beautiful homeless child and
one white Rose brought one ray

of light, it's what
Elizabeth chose.

But Elizabeth's gift is
what's shone through.

Now a new path that
nurtured and grew.

There was this gift from
heaven above, from tragic

death came stability and love.

But it was Elizabeth's gift
that gave new

meaning to their life.

She saved a little girl and
brought back a husband

and a wife.

We love you, Elizabeth.


Thank you.

What seems to be
the problem, officer?

You know you went right
through that stop

sign back there.

I'm sorry. I'm really tired.

It's been a long day.

She looks a
little tired herself.

She's been playing
with her friends all day.

Is punkin back yet?

No. I was just gonna go
check on them.

I'll be right back.

Is there anything
we can do here?

I'm very sorry.


Punkin, you still in there?

Julie?

I've got a daughter myself.

I know how it is.

Do me a favor, okay?

Pay attention.

I'll let you off with a warning.

Absolutely.

Thank you so much, officer.

Punkin!

Julie, wake up!

Julie, what happened?

Julie.

It's chloroform.

What do you mean chloroform?

Where's punkin?

I don't know.

I need you to stay
here with Julie.

It's Paulie.

I know it. It's Paulie.

Listen to me.

Let me go with you.

No.

You need to stay here and
take care of Julie, okay?

Listen to me, listen to me,
I'm gonna bring

her back, okay?

Find our daughter.

Seven delta, copy?

Did you see anything?

No. What happened?

They took punkin.

I'm so sorry.

Elizabeth?

Sweetie.

Sweetie.

What is it?

What are you trying to tell me?

Who are you talking to?

Devine, I need your help.

With what?

My daughter. Punkin.

I think Paulie has her.

I don't want
nothing to do with him.

I'll get myself killed.

I know you know something.

You knew her mother.

You said you were her friend.

Devine, I already lost a
daughter once, I am not gonna

let that happen again.

Please.

She was my friend.

Then help me find Paulie.

How?

Show me where he lives,
where he hangs out.

I know a couple of places.

Great. Let's go.

Sir, sir, I need to
ask you a few questions.

Sure thing, officer.

What is your name?

My name is Gill Jentezen.

And your business here?

Part of the catering company.

We've been serving food and
cake during the speeches.

You haven't seen
anything unusual?

Anyone suspicious?

No, sir.

Just been doing my job.

Been in and out of
the kitchen all night.

Pity too, it seemed like
everything was going

so well for that lady.

Well, thank you
for your cooperation.

Here's my card.

Give me a call if you happen
to remember anything.

I will.
Thank you, officer.

Have a good night.

You do the same.

[Phone ringing]

I thought I told you never
call me on this number.

Where is she, man?

This is taking too long.

Look, take a deep breath.

She'll be there in a minute.

Just relax.

Don't tell me to relax.

I'll relax when I see her.

Where's she at?

Everything went off without
a hitch, so you just make sure

you have the other half of my
money, and don't you ever call

me on this number again.

Where are you?

I'm almost there.

I had a little snafu thing.

It was a little snafu.

What do you mean you
ran into a little snafu?

It's nothing.

What do you mean I'm an
ID..., I'm not an idiot.

You're an idiot.

Don't you hang up on...

Idiot!

I'm gonna kill him.

This is it. Pull over.

So what is this?

Look, I know you're involved.

You help me find punkin, and
I won't arrest you

for arms dealing.

Okay, this is where
Paulie hangs out.

I used to make deliveries
behind the dumpster.

No one suspected a homeless
lady pushing a shopping cart

to be delivering guns.

So punkin's would call, and then
Paulie would come and

he'd pick them up.

I don't see his car.

I don't think he's here.

Where else would he be?

I made deliveries
to one other place.

Where?

A warehouse on the West Side.

Show me.

What took so long?

What is she, dead?

She's sleeping.

She'll be up in a minute.

How much to finish the job?

Finish the job?

We did our job.

Disposal is your part of it.

Give me my money.

It's all there.

It better be.

Get rid of her.

Easy.

He's here.

That's his car.

I ain't going no where.

I'll beat anybody that

Where is she!

Dad!

Dad!

Dad!

Dad!

Where are you, sweetheart?

Dad?

Dad help me.

Dad.

Where are you?

Dad, where are you?

Put it down!
Put it down now!

Put the gun down!

Right.

Slowly.

All right.

Just don't hurt her.

Put your hands up.

Okay.

[Siren blaring]

Smart cop.

You called for backup.

Looks like I might need a
hostage to get out

of here, huh?

Funny thing about
hostages, you know.

You only need one.

Turn around!

Now!

You're gonna be
okay sweetheart.

Okay.

I said turn around!

The police are coming.

You're gonna be fine, all right.

Turn around!

I love you.

Now!

Close your eyes.

Turn around!

On your knees!


Take him out of here.

What'd you do?

Spread your legs.

Spread 'em!

Don't you move!


Thank you.

The little girl outside,
she wouldn't leave until I

gave you this.


Do you know how
much I love you?

I told you Iâ€™d bring her back.

Thank you.

Thank you.

No.

We should be
thanking you, Laura.

Without you, none
of this happens.

But, you know, in spite of the
scare, we had a

really big night.

There's over $100,000 dollars
in checks in that envelope.

Your foundation
is up and running.


Laura!

If you keep the faith,
they'll be at your grace.

They may even leave
a trace you may see.

Or may be me.

Look in the mirror,
you might even see her.

Think about them.

Dream about them.

And remember there
are angels in the air.

You know, this was
Elizabeth's favorite book.

Well, it's mine too.


When tragedy strikes, it
is faith that keeps us going.

Our faith must remain strong
through the dark days until we

heal enough to
actually see the light.

In death, Elizabeth gave me
the greatest gift of all, a

reason to live and love again.
