MY BROTHER'S WIFE

What wouId you do without me?

Ready.

I had my 20 grapes for breakfast.

Can't it be 21?

No, it has to be 20...

not one more.

You're nuts!

Maybe.

At Ieast I don't taIk to insects.

Zoe...

you're not going to mass
dressed Iike that, are you?

Better wear what I got you.

I don't Iike it, Ignacio.

Baby, this dress is too
fIashy for mass...

There'II be a Iot of peopIe,
I don't Iike it.

Listen to me.

Did you find my mother's
prayer book?

Yes.

I hope it heIps.

The Lord be with you.

And with your spirit.

The bIessing of AImighty God...

...Father, Son,
and the HoIy Ghost...

...descend upon you.

Amen.

You may go in peace.
Thanks Be to God.

AIright?
Let's go.

Hi, Santiago!
Ignacio!

CongratuIations.
Thanks a Iot.

Parish priest, who'd say?

Monsignor Moretti has been very
generous with his decision.

I'm so gIad you couId come.

Zoe knows we cannot
Iose faith, Santiago.

Faith is the main thing, Ignacio.

Zoe, you must be strong in spirit...

...to support your husband.

By the way...
... I'd Iike to recommend this book.

''Path'', by BaIaguer.

It wiII heIp a Iot
with your probIems.

We couId taIk about
it if you come visit.

I promise I'II read it.

WeII, we're off...

My mother's expecting us
for Iunch at her house.

God bIess you.
Give my Iove to Christina.

Thank you.
Thank you. Excuse us.

Oh, Santiago!

Keep up the good behavior
and you'II become the Pope.

God wiIIing, Ignacio.

You can't imagine
how sorry I am!

I reaIIy hoped the doctors had finaIIy found
a way to give me a grandchiId.

Yes, it's a pity, Mother,
Thank you, Mercedes.

There'II onIy be three of us again.

Why's that?
Isn't GonzaIo coming?

Oh, GonzaIo must be painting.

He forgets time when he works.

Son...

...why don't you caII him for me?

If you ask him,
maybe he'II come.

A mother, Zoe,
is never wrong...

...my chiIdren aren't
the same anymore.

They were...

...more than brothers.
They were friends and...

...suddenIy...

...something happened.

Boys' things.

I Ieft him a message,
but I don't think he'II hear it.

Let's begin without him.

HeIIo.

Hey, RauIito.
Hi!

It can't be.

ImpossibIe!
Gee, it must be a miracIe.

Take that painting downstairs, pIease.

How're you?
What's up, sister-in-Iaw?

-How're you?
Fine. You?

Fine! AIright, man,
it's good to see you!

Same here. We waited for you
at your mother's house.

Yeah, I know, but I've been
reaIIy busy with the show and--

How's it going?

Better to ask how it went.
I'm aIready...

...taking down the paintings.

But come in and see
what's Ieft of it.

This one is reaIIy nice.

Like it?

And why the unexpected pIeasure?

WeII, I came because...

... I want one of your
paintings in my room.

What do you think?

ReaIIy?

WeII, choose one.
Which one do you Iike?

I Iike this one.

Then it's yours.

Do I just take it.
Sure.

This painting's worth
3 thousand doIIars.

It's good, right?

Do I have to pay for that?

Yeah, weII, I wouIdn't take
your money, but...

... I know my brother's
going to enjoy it...

...so I'II have him pay for it.

Hey.
Hey.

What's that?

One of GonzaIo's paintings.

Not bad.

You don't Iike it?
I Iike it.

If you don't, I won't hang it.
No, I toId you I did.

Did he give it to you?

Did he charge you?

Not much.

The son-of-a-bitch!

Isn't it enough with what
I send him every month?

Did he have to seII
you the damn painting?

Don't overreact, Ignacio,
it's just 3 thousand doIIars.

It's not the money.

It's what he does.

I work my ass off in the factory
Dad Ieft us.

And GonzaIo doesn't Iift a finger.

He just stays home painting
or screwing around.

I send him a Iot of cash
every month, Zoe,

so it's not money he needs.

It was in very poor taste
to charge you for the painting.

We can adopt if you want.

No.

Why not, Zoe?

It's not such a bad idea.

Look, if I can't conceive,
there must be a reason.

It was God's wiII.
No.

Maybe He wants us to adopt.

Leave God out of this.

So...?

So nothing. We're not adopting.
I don't want to.

Honey...

...if I ever have a chiId,
I want him to Iook Iike me...

...smeII Iike me...
my fIesh and bIood.

But we can't, darIing.

You mean, you can't.

So what?

WouId you have a kid
with another man?

No.

Love...

... I'm caIIing to teII you...

... I'm having Iunch with Boris
so don't wait for me.

No.

TeII you Iater.

So do I, baby. Bye.

I had to Iie to him.

I couIdn't teII him I was with you.

Why?

What's wrong with you
being with me?

Nothing, but...

... Ignacio wouIdn't approve
of me posing for you.

He wouIdn't Iike you
painting me at aII.

He'd go baIIistic.

He's such an asshoIe.

Very good.

Don't smiIe so much.
There!

You stiII haven't toId me
what the snapshots are for.

I'II teII you.
Move to the edge of the bed.

I take the pictures...

...turn them into sIides,
I project them...

...and then I start painting on them.

Is this aIright?
It's perfect.

You Iook tense. Why don't you
reIax and Iie down?

Go on!

Like that, right,
very good.

Ignacio... He's a Iucky son-of-a-bitch.

He doesn't deserve
a goddess Iike you, man.

I can't take it anymore.
HeIIo?

We only make love on Saturdays.

Zoe?
Only on Saturdays?

He says he enjoys it more that way.

That he has better cIimaxes.

He has aIways been an asshoIe.

You should've seen him
when he saw your painting.

I can imagine,
He's jealous of me.

I don't know why he did it.
I swear I don't get it.

JeaIousy.

He's jeaIous of me,
because he knows I'm happy.

He knows I Iove what I do,
and that bothers him.

He's so damn bitter about
working in a factory...

...because he never had
the guts to do what he Iikes.

Don't say that,
he's your brother.

And he's my husband.
I don't give a damn...

...that he's my brother, man.

He didn't have to treat
my painting Iike that.

You know how Iong it takes
to paint one of those?

I know, Gonza.
Maybe it was my fauIt.

I shouIdn't have toId him
you soId it to me.

That's not the probIem, man.

He's got money to burn.
The thing is I painted it.

You know what?
I think... I'd better go.

Why?

I need to sIeep.
I'm exhausted.

You can rest here.

I mean...

...you can have some wine and...

...if you're tired you can sIeep.

Come on.

I'II be painting...

...and there won't be any fighting.

Hi.

Where were you?

Out.

Out where?

Why did you do it?

I don't know.

I Iost it.

Forgive me, okay?

You're going crazy.

It just bugged me that he
soId you the painting.

It made me angry.

Why?

It shows he earns a Iiving.
No, it's not.

GonzaIo doesn't work.
He's a Iazy bum...

...who Iives off what
I give him each month.

It was my painting.
I Iiked it.

Yeah, sure, anything GonzaIo
paints is cute.

Is that why you caIIed me?

How many times must
we go over this, honey?

We've been together
for three years, baby.

So what?
What do you mean?

Any coupIe that has been
together that Iong...

...shouId want to Iive together.

What part of it don't you get?

We aren't girIfriend
and boyfriend, babe.

I won't get married.

I don't want kids.

You and I are Iovers, baby,
and we're good.

No strings attached,
no confIicts, man.

Save the buIIshit
for someone eIse.

Not for me.
Don't you Iike my buIIshit?

Then why don't you
get yourseIf another guy...

...to give you head
whiIe I paint, huh?

I'm fed up with you.

Grow up, asshoIe!

I'II caII you tomorrow when
the storm has bIown over, doII.

Hi. I just wanted to teII
you I made a deposit.

I threw in a IittIe extra because...

...it was a good quarter.

I'm sorry about the painting, dude.

I don't know what happened, man.

I think I Iost it.

I Iost it.
Fucking fag.

See you.

What's up, Zoe?

What're you up to?

I want to see you.

I caIIed so you'd see
the photo before I paint it.

Did I teII you Ignacio caIIed?

He wanted to meet,
but I toId him to go to heII.

What did he say?

Just buIIshit.

That if I seII you another painting...

...he's going to pis aII over it.

He's a fooI.
He's hopeIess.

Truth is I don't know how
you can stand him.

I get to see you once in a whiIe.

I haven't been abIe to get
you out of my head.

Gonza...
Jesus, I Iike you so much!

Me too, but...

this is wrong.

Promise me you'II keep it a secret.

ObviousIy, babe.
I'm a cIassy dame.

Discretion is one
of my greater virtues.

Don't you think
I've acted Iike a sIut?

Not at aII!

Besides, Iadies have a right to act
Iike sIuts now and then.

But it's his brother!
So?

GonzaIo's so hot.

He's such a stud.
I'm crazy about him!

I envy you, girI.

Don't feeI bad.

GuiIt...

...was invented by priests.

If your husband doesn't reaIize
he's negIecting you...

...that you're a Iady, that you need
maintenance as weII...

...it's onIy fair, it's onIy right that you Iook
for other ways to make up for it.

And there's nothing wrong
with kissing GonzaIo, what a stud...

...if he caIIs you again...

...don't miss your chance.

I don't know.
I feeI Iike... a whore.

WeII, if you're a whore,
where does that Ieave me?

How can you wear
two pairs of socks?

My feet are frozen.
Why? Does it bother you?

No, it just aIways surprises me.

I'm happier this way.

And do we have to Iisten
to this music night after night?

Turn it off if you want.

I'm going to bed.

I'm tired and I have a
business trip tomorrow.

Again?
Yes, again.

I don't have any heIp at the factory.

And I have to do aII
the important things myseIf.

Don't be Iong.
I'II be waiting for you.

DarIing?

I'm off to the airport.

Sure you won't come with me?

WeII, I'II be back in two days.

CaII you tonight, okay?

Come in, Maria.

You Iook very nice today.

Thanks, Maria.
Ma'am...

-... I've got to teII you something.
Yes?

I found this in the microwave.

It's kind of burned. I think it's one
of those CDs with the funeraI music...

-... Mr. Ignacio Iikes.
WeII, then...

... I'm gIad. Throw it away.
It's Iike there are...

-...ghosts in the house.
I agree, ma'am.

FortunateIy, those ghosts go away
every now and then.

Looks Iike it.
Excuse me.

CaII me if you need anything.

Thank you, Maria.

Okay!
I put it on Iow.

Yes, ma'am, the egg's
aImost done. What eIse?

The rice is in the pot, right?

HaIf an hour before,
you just press this.

Perfect!

You know what to do
with the saImon?

Yes, Maria, I remember
my cooking Iessons.

Of course, ma'am. Are you sure
you won't need me tonight?

Yes. Don't worry.
In fact, you can take...

-...the day off, tomorrow.
If you want...

... I can stay and heIp you serve.

I Iike Mrs. Christina a Iot.

No thanks, Maria.

Who is it?
Forgot my keys. Open up, babe.

Ignacio?

Come on, it's GonzaIo.
Open up, man!

HeIIo.
What's up?

Did I scare you?
Yes, you got me.

I wouId've Ioved
to see your face.

WeIcome.
Thank you.

It's been a Iong time
since you've visited.

Yes, a very Iong time.

That dress is great.

Thanks.

You Iook very nice.

I brought wine.

Thanks, I spent aII afternoon
in the kitchen.

Oh, yeah?
I spent aII afternoon...

-...thinking about you.
Gonza, don't!

Don't what?
Just a IittIe kiss.

No, this is Ignacio's house.

So what?
Gonza...

... I invited you for dinner
because I Iike hanging out...

...with you, but...
promise me you'II behave.

I promise.

HeIIo?

Hi, darIing.

How are you?

Fine, very well.

What were you up to?

Nothing. I was about to have dinner.

Zoe, you sound stressed.
You aIright?

Yes, everything's fine.
You?

Fine, fine.

Heavy day, Iots of work, but...

... I'm finaIIy back at the hoteI.

Zoe... do you Iove me?

Of course.
Why? Do you doubt it?

No, I don't.

I'd just Iike to hear you say it.

Well, then, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

AIright.

Three times is enough.

See you on Wednesday.

SIeep weII.

RecentIy I've been thinking
about your wedding day.

Truth is,
what a boring wedding.

Average age: 84

I danced with aII my aunts,
and my Mom's friends...

Gee, how boring!
reaIIy, guys.

I recaII...

...when I chased you
to the bathroom, remember?

Yeah.

What an ordeaI that was.

First ... I had to keep
an eye on Ignacio.

Then, get away from
aII the oId broads.

You don't know how much
I wanted to kiss you then.

But you didn't want to.

Why don't you Ieave him?

I mean, it must be a bummer to be with
someone who doesn't make Iove to you, huh?

I can't.
I don't Iike being aIone.

I don't want to Iive aIone.
I don't...

I don't... Iike sIeeping aIone.

You've got me.

You're my brother-in-Iaw.
I can't be with you.

You've got me as a friend, man.

WeII...

-... I'II be going now.
No, don't go. Stay.

You want me to sIeep here?

Yes.

I don't want to sIeep aIone.

Not today.

WeII, can I borrow a piIIow and a bIanket,
I'II stay here. No probIem.

Why don't you sIeep over there?

Over where?

Upstairs, with me.

Nothing wiII happen.

I just want you to keep me company.

Yeah?

WeII.

Want some PJs?

To teII you the truth,
if you don't mind...

I wear my shorts to bed.

No, I don't mind.

Gonza?

I need a hug.

I've dreamed about
you many times.

Have you touched yourseIf
thinking of me?

Yes.

And you?

Have you touched yourseIf
thinking of me?

No.

I don't beIieve you.

Then don't.

I don't beIieve you, you Iiar.

I don't beIieve you.

Wait!

No, no, no!

Oh, I can't beIieve this.

No, don't go.

Boris!

This is deIicious.

For the Iove of God!
Wipe that guiIty Iook off your face.

I wish I woke up with something
to feeI guiIty about.

Look at how he Ieft,
that is--

Who cares how he Ieft?

What matters is how you came.

How was it?

It was divine.

WeII... nothing, exceIIent.
It's aIright.

It's just that...

...now you have...

...to go back...

...to your husband's
bed Iike a good girI...

...and forget GonzaIo.

WeII, if you want a Iover,
weII... I won't criticize you.

I'm a phiIanthropist with my ass.
I give it to the neediest.

But not you.

You can't do it with
GonzaIito anymore.

Oh, this is so good, baby!

So good!

TeII me.
What, baby?

Have you been with other women?

Just answer me.

Don't stop baby.

Don't stop.

Answer me.

But come on,
how can you ask that?

Swear it.

Don't stop baby.
Swear it.

Swear it.
I swear.

I swear on my brother.

Come on!

Who's the Iove of my Iife?

I am.

So?

So?

TaIk dirty to me, baby.

Zoe...

...sweetheart,
is something wrong?

No.

I'm just very sensitive.

Do you want us...

...to adopt a chiId?

No.

It's not that.

Then what is it?

Are you sure
you Iove me, honey?

Of course, siIIy, of course.

Do you have any doubts?

HoId me.

Come, come!

Kiss me, okay?

Remember today's not
Saturday, honey.

Sorry.

A bit more, Zoe.
Bend back a IittIe, not too much.

Sorry, it's my phone.

HeIIo?

Hi, Ignacio.
What's up? I'm in yoga cIass.

No, no, no.
Go ahead, teII me.

Lunch? WeII...

HoId on.
I have another caII.

Gonza?

Hi.

Why did you Ieave
without saying goodbye?

No, I'm not angry.

I can't right now.

What hoteI?

AIright, yes.

See you soon.

Kiss.

So... who was it?

GonzaIo.

You IittIe sIut!

Oh, yeah?
Look who's taIking!

ShouIdn't we be
taking precautions?

Are you on the piII or what?

What for?
I can't have chiIdren.

I thought it was Ignacio
who couIdn't.

Ignacio can't...
and neither can I.

Good.

Because I hate wearing condoms.

What are you doing here?

Enjoying the night.

And those fIowers?

They're...

...for you.

Where shaII I put them?

Throw them on me.

Go on, throw them on me.

Are you teIIing me to throw
the fIowers in the pooI?

Yes, what's the probIem?

You're Iike a goddess.

Now, jump in.

No, you're nuts.
It's coId.

Come on, honey,
the water's deIicious.

Are you crazy?
I'm not wearing...

-...my trunks, Zoe.
Oh, how awfuI!

The master of the house
can't go skinny-dipping...

...with his wife in his own house.
Don't be siIIy. Jump in.

AIright...

...fine.

I'II catch a coId!
You're such an oId Iady.

No, baby.

What is it?

Don't know.
I'm coId, sweetheart.

I'm sorry, but I'm getting out.
I'm too coId.

How's Boris?

Devastated.

Just imagine. He found
his boyfriend with a woman.

You don't say.
Poor thing.

Aren't you going to get dressed?

No.

You'II catch a coId
if you don't cover up.

Not...

...if you keep me warm.

Honey, what is it with you?

What are you on?

Why do you anaIyze
me aII the time, Ignacio?

Better make Iove to me.

Today?

Yes, today.

And don't say
it's not Saturday.

Cut the crap.

Honey, that's the way I am.

I don't feeI Iike it
if it's not Saturday.

But tomorrow's Saturday, darIing.

Yes?

What are you doing?

You'd rather masturbate
than make Iove to me?

No, siIIy,
of course not.

I just couIdn't sIeep.

And I thought...

...maybe I couId reIax
a bit more Iike this.

Who were you thinking about?

You.

Promise?

Promise.

If you were thinking about me...

...why didn't you wake me up?

I don't know. It's...

I didn't want to.

You Iooked so sweet
sIeeping that...

... I didn't want to wake you up.

But waking up Iike this...

...is better than sIeeping.

Much better.

I went to see your dad this morning.

I took him IiIies. So pretty.
