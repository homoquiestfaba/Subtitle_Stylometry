Proudly Presents
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS

Translated from dutch

Excuse me, sir,
Can We Help?

Can we help you with something?
Did I miss the show?

I am afraid so.
The show was this afternoon.

Did you participate with the group from Green Haven?
Come, we will call them for you

No, I was on my own.
It's okay.

We call it home
so they pick you up.

I say that I was alone. Maybe you
without those rings are not deaf and dumb.

He is very attentive.
Sorry, I meant it not.

Your rings look very nice.

Take that back to my trailer walker
so we can pack.

I have to pick this car park.
Go sit in the wheelchair...

and then we go inside to call.
Please.

Drive through.
How are you?

I seek 's song I do not think.
A nursing home, Greenhaven.

Hopefully, they sweat.

I went without anyone noticing
out.

Greenhaven. A nursing home.
Hello?

Hagenbeck-Wallace for bankruptcy.

Yes, you know circuses?
I've been on two.

Can I still call to someone else?
The first was the Benzini Brothers.

Benzini Brothers. When?
1931.

How long?

You know them by the end of 1931
have never met.

Tell me now that you were there...
There in the middle.

Incredibly, because after the fire at Harper
and the bankruptcy of Hagenbeck-Wallace...

is the most famous circus tragedy ever.

Are you okay?

Need something else to drink
than apple juice?

Yes, I think so.

Please.

I remember you.
How long have you been in that nursing home?

Too long. Why do they call it
a house? You know nobody there.

They give you so many drugs
that you do not care anymore.

Five children and none of them
I can stay since their mother died.

They take turns visiting.

My son forgot whose turn it was, limiting speeds...

I can 't blame him.
He is 71, begin to forget.

'S are not bad kids.
It's not their fault that I am old.

I had a good life.

A grand life.

Sit down.

I'm sorry.
My name is Charlie O'Brian III.

Jacob Jankowski, the only one.

Well found.

You should not call the nursing home?

Let them sweat.

But if I could, I was wondering...

can you tell me what
happened in 1931?

We will need another bottle.

It was a big day:
My last exam.

I was not fast enough.
My life was finally beginning.

And I knew exactly where it lives
bring me to send it.

In our house there was no sign of 's depression.

My mother and father had
Poland in worse condition.

According to them, none could be poor in America.

I love you.
I love you.

After six years of dissections,
castrations and my hand in a cow of his hole...

more often than I care to remember,
I was in 't end of the day a veterinarian.

And that at the end of that evening I was
the first boy to Catherine Hale...

ever 'r bed had been invited.
She loved me.

You have two hours for the exam
finish. When it is finished...

close the book, put the
upside down and raise your hand.

With my approval you can 't
exam to bring me...

and leave. Play on.

I had a new life mapped out.

And then with it open to show a door...

lost all my plans.
Mr. Jankowski?

May we talk here?

Jacob, I fear that there is a
car accident.

Can we still call relatives?

According to our record, there is no
error, Mr. Jankowski.

The house and all possessions,
with the practice of your father...

his possession of the bank loan due.
You got it wrong.

My father owned the house.
These documents were four years ago...

signed by him.
They had something when money is needed?

My school.
There you have it.

If you're not going to college
gone, you had a house.

But as your father did his business,
is highly unlikely.

My father was feeling good man.
He offered more assistance to...

He was a irresponsible man.

People could pay him
with chickens and eggs, everything...

instead of money.

This longstanding depression on.

And the only people who do not suffer
are the ones who take what is needed.

Do not make the same mistake as him.

I remember that through the front door
left.

I forced myself not to look back.

I could not stay where I
I would remember them.

I saw it again at no point in
go to school.

There were many men when
no home, no family.

Living in small villages
where they died.

It was rumored that there was work
in the big cities.

So I got it in my head
to walk to Albania.

I've never met.

Do not tamper with Blackie. People
Trains throwing is part of his work.

We do not need bums on this train.

Quiet. Put the gun away.
Let him go.

And I mean on the inside
of the train.

I say not you, we want no problems.
Look at his clothes.

He's not a tramp.

No fear, it's almost a reflex of the m.

I am Camel.
They are Grady and Wade.

I'm Jacob Jankowski.
Jankowski?

Poland?

Thanks.
You're young to roam. Are you running?

No, no such thing.
Where are you going?

No idea.
Are you hungry?

No work? You must therefore
not ashamed.

What can you do?
Everything, I suppose.

We are in Deposit morning.
We look for work there for you...

and if you still alive in the evening,
I'll take you to August...

the master of the
known and unknown universe itself.

Who is that?

Hang on, you start
the ride of your life.

Quiet.

See that?

I do not know if that train me
train if I have chosen...

but something told me that my parents
I have moved ahead.

That is all I believe.

Hello, ma'am.

What are you doing here?
Go out of there.

You do not hear from the menagerie.
Come on.

I have work for you.
Animal?

Be sure.

Much manure I've never seen.
It holds 27 in a wagon.

How do you endure the smell?
What smell?

Ladies and gentlemen, come see
to the staggering collection...

of miracles in this world.

If he gives the signal,
we ought to push people to the entrance.

The rest follows
all will be well.

Utter perfection.

All but a dime
and believe me it will be your best edition ever.

I guarantee you.
This way.

Ladies on the right side,
men left.

Foot for foot and the body follows.

Take this. Save with it...

when you see heads peek
without paying.

Silver.

Good boy.

You okay?

You're shaking "a bit.

Excuse me, ma'am?

Can I see?

Walk on.

Stacey, walking.

Showtime. Forward.

Ladies and gentlemen...

and children of all ages,
welcome to 's most extravagant...

it 's human eye can see.

Welcome the stars of the Benzini Brothers
most spectacular show in the world.

She seemed at first not really.

How she looked in that big arena.
Among those lights.

This phenomenon almost blinded me.

Benzini Brothers surpass God.
They created the sky in one day.

And just as soon the sky again.

Take a breath, but otherwise
throw it all out again.

What is that?
Jake, all we have.

Damn cheap junk.

I am not an American man
a drink to remember.

Will not change the constitution,
then a man is entitled to happiness?

Come on, I'll take you to August.

Now? It is night.
Then the circus alive.

Musicians and entertainers
standing above us, but...

In the special numbers
which are under the trainer.

Everyone is under the bosses.
Never forget that.

Note these clowns.
Nobody touched by this corridor intact.

Lucinda, my dear.
Good evening, how are you?

You let it shine here.
I know you. I saw you in my show.

Do you want a private dance?

How's your pipe?
Calm down, Barbara.

Good evening, ladies.
We can do it.

We think like him.
Good evening. Do not talk...

Before you familiar with our language
if your head is stamped...

as a villager in the city
and artists are artists...

certainly not directly say.
How do I call them?

Artists.
Do not talk to them and you live longer.

Be quiet in here, because we have
show respect to the ladies. Men.

Camel, who is the woman who
the horses work?

That is the wife of the boss.

Marlena. The main attraction
and they talk to anyone.

And you are not with her.
She points on you anyway.

I have a son same age as you.
He lives in Pennsylvania.

I 'm not seen for years.

Put your shirt properly.

Before we do this, I ask you something
and I want to use does not interfere...

but I do know that you still
not long wandering.

So, before you start I must ask you:
If you got a life back to where you can...

you should do that.

I did not.

I'm sorry.

Remember, let me talk.
And never talk about the Ringling Brothers.

He hates them tremendously.

This is Earl and he will let you in.

This is Jacob.

Pleasant.

What is this?
A stowaway...

Polish those alcoholic
took under his wing.

A college boy.

I think we know each other yet.
Jacob Jankowski, sir.

And what do I do with 'n Jacob Jankowski do?

I'm looking for other work.
Have you ever worked?

No, sir.
Ever seen a show?

Yes, the Ringling Brothers.

Ringling, eh?
Yes, they were bad.

They try to do, right guys?

Have you seen our show?
Yes, sir.

What is your favorite act?

The one with the white and black horses.

You notice a lot.
My best part.

I do believe that we have someone
Search for the elephants.

We do not have elephants.

That sounds perfect.
I like working with animals.

Come here.

Is this a day?

Why would a college boy are
hands dirty?

I think because among all
sweat and dirt...

you like working with these men that
do not participate in daylight to be seen.

So much beauty.
Streaming now with me?

No, sir.
That was nicely said.

Still traveling in my train,
eat my dinner without permission...

while hard working men
every day for the same things.

And this mess is my family.
You're an intruder.

Throw him there the next stop.
He studied poetry down.

I study veterinary science,
no poetry.

And I can tell you something:
That top horse of your...

can in a couple weeks not walk,
let alone make a presentation.

Wait.

Veterinary Medicine?
What school?

Cornell.
A Cornell graduate?

He shoveled manure or afternoon.
Pretty good.

He is not a horse doctor
horse shit all day because he was intercepted.

Ringling has established its own vet.

Cornell, come on.

Are you sure?
Yes.

Good.

Unbelievable.

Breathtaking, huh?

My star is lame and I get no horse
middle of it season.

So, make sure the horse is acting
and you get the job. Nine dollars a week.

If you do not mind doing
I give you a dream life.

Come on.

I can make a man 's degree is used.

You are tired to talk
guys with no sense.

Come on.

Kinko.
August.

I got a roommate for you.
What is it?

Jacob Jankowski.
I asked what, not whom.

He is our new vet.

Iveay League, thereby
He is estimated to be higher than you.

Maybe you want your bed to offer.

See you tomorrow morning.
Then we're talking about that horse.

I had a Jack Russell.

He was smart.

You get the bed.

May I introduce you to...
Jacob Jankowski.

Benzini Brothers' own vet.

Is he the vet?

That he studied at Cornell University.

On the right front hoof.

It's an abscess.
Honey.

In the show it looked not so bad off.
Do you need a star need?

I do not think so.
It is cold and heat.

And a salt link.
It'll be fine.

Come on, boy.
Help him to enter.

Come on, boy.

Well?

I wanted to say anything on her.

The horse has laminitis.
In english.

The connective tissue between
the hoof and the bone is inflamed.

If he is running, the bone
to allow the hoof.

Until it is through.
But not yet?

No, but they will.

And he suffers much pain.
How much time?

Two or three days.

He must be completed.

You know all that by just
watch? Can you do anything?

No, it's pretty serious.

'M sorry.
I appreciate it.

Honey, Cornell agrees
with you that it is okay.

Joe, Pete lets help Marlena.
That will feed the tigers.

We are doing well.
You care for him.

They each have a bucket.

Are you sure this stuff they like?
It's already rotten.

They love goats.

The goats are all.

Start with Rex here in the middle.

Should I open the door
and throw it inside?

Unless you want to formally sit down?

Slow and quiet.

Then he notices that you're not.

Have they not learned in school?

Lay it gently.
Not throw.

You want to scare him.

Do you think that's funny?
Yes.

I had lost my arm can be.
Not true.

He has no teeth.

Does it hurt?

Something?

You wanted to finish my star?

No treatment, no need star,
Cornell only your courage.

You know what a circus survives?
You said it yourself.

Blood, sweat, pain and shit.

When the circus comes ill with food
animal waste. People eat anything.

Your heart goes out to the animals.
Very noble.

Very good, but you've obviously
people never suffer.

Before I get back from the city do
everything they have learned from you...

and you make sure that horse
ready for the parade.

Until we can walk
we give a performance.

It is not an abscess, is it?

He has an infection in his hoof.

It's okay, honey.

We had him from the show
should achieve.

It's not your fault.
It just happens.

It is not uncommon.

However, he suffers.

The pain is worse.

He would be killed.

That will not happen, do you?

Not if he has a few ideas
For August can do.

Here everyone works
to them under the ground.

He can only die if August says so.

And then August?
I am a vet. It is my decision.

That's your last.

Just go.

No, I keep him quiet.

Good boy.

Okay?

It'll be fine.

Mr. Jankowski...

I will be sorry when you leave.

This circus, my circus
is a sovereign nation.

If you break my law,
you pay a price.

I tell you that your horse hoof
to heal.

Then you break my law.
The penalty is the red light.

You need to get out.
Only we do not stop.

So unlikely that you survive.

Let me explain.
Not required.

You took the initiative.
I respect that.

I keep the law.
Throw him.

Wait.

The only reason you are not permanent
forms part of the landscape...

is that you might have avoided
that Marlena would get hurt.

And you have a big problem
solved for me.

You saw what we gave the tigers to eat.
That was not good.

Through them you will Silverstar
We provide fresh meat to sell tickets.

You have my best song being killed.

If we do not sell tickets
and the men are not paid...

they want someone to blame.

Welcome to the circus, Cornell.

In three cities, we had
cancel performances.

It was rumored that there are four men
were piloted to save money.

Then we might save.

We lost a lot of circuses in 1931.

The people were tired of being mistreated
be, so they revolted.

The directors saw the end approaching
and went with all the money away.

There were a lot of animals and performers around.
Bones that you could take.

Fortunately we found one in Cochin.

And August was all for a bargain.

The rest of them would never
play a show.

When I saw their faces I thought,
August is right.

I've never seen
people were hungry.

Honey, one moment please.

Erwin, here.
Joe, pour the champagne.

I want you all
the 'earthquake effect' experience...

from what I'm going to show you.

I have made a purchase which
The Gasoline Brothers are at the top.

Treasure.
Yes?

Silver Star I can not really replace you,
but give me a chance to try it.

You should not have to do.
Joe the doors.

Kids, meet our salvation.

Here's a guaranteed sale.
Elephant acclaimed by the crowd.

Her name is Rosie.
She was 53.

And she's beautiful.
What's in her mouth?

She ran away.
She was eating at a cemetery.

I'm going to invent a whole star attraction
around you and her.

Since I did not climb.
I've never ridden an elephant.

You did not know how to ride a galloping
horse to stand, until I showed up.

You learn fast.
This piece will be the highlight.

Where we let her?
Make it instead.

How we pay her?

I pay the men just
a few weeks.

We've done it before.

If we sell out, the men so much
money that they do not know what to do with them.

This is great.
I know.

Are you the olifantenman?
He is my vet.

If you do not have olifantenman,
I must inform the municipality.

Otherwise I can not sell her.

I am the olifantenman.
Say that then.

This beast is the dumbest beast
that God's good earth around.

Here's your stick elephants.
He will need you.

Success. An elephant dumber
I have never seen in my life.

Cornell, go look at her.

Jump to know.
You will write history.

He has gone mad.

You know how hard it is
to a new song to do?

My name is Jacob Jankowski.

Pleasant.
This is...

Marlena Rosenbluth.

You're a beauty.
Your skin is somewhat dry.

We need to do something. The first thing you
Notes on a woman her age is her skin.

Great. That is what we needed that.
Another alcoholic.

You're welcome.

Flirting as elephants?

Will you be alone?

I think she loves music.

It's a beautiful song.

"I confess that I love you."

So hot that song.
Of course.

Louis Armstrong.

It might as well be now.

Climb it.
So jump into the deep.

Can you help me with this step?

August gave me bluntly
a monkey song.

The meanest monkeys you've ever seen.
They bit me during the entire performance.

And I laugh and pretend it belonged.

I think it is very important to a band
to build off-piste around.

How do I look?
Stupid for sure.

No, you were made for each.

She is beautiful.

Mr. and Mrs. Rosenbluth invite you
for cocktails and dinner.

Come inside.

Glad you could come, Jacob.
To celebrate our beautiful new elephant.

Is something wrong?

I do not really have the right clothing.
Nonsense, I told you already

Nothing but the best for our own
Cornell graduate vet...

what the bastards of Ringling
have not. I have checked.

I thought you ever could use new clothes.

And a shave.

My vet can not smell
to his patients.

Do you do that?
Of course. Perfection.

When I started it was Benzini
this show is nothing but a scam.

And man could not walk straight
without having been robbed.

Benzini was an impostor.

He invested a cent
new songs.

When he stopped it, everybody thought
that was with us.

Not me.
You were 19 right?

August sent all pickpockets
and crooks from office.

He sold two clowns and a wagon to
Lucinda, our beautiful colt now.

And Rex.

You kept the dancers.
Their earnings were convincing.

I needed money.

I had every bankrupt circus stripping
to every song that we have.

I do not have to buy.

With you I had married.
That's right.

Were you an artist?
August taught me everything I know now.

He said that on one day as large
would like the Ringling Brothers.

That damn brothers were brilliant.

That gave the family the idea that they show a
saw their mothers and sisters could see.

No sex, no scam.

Safe for children.
And no one could surpass their visitor.

But, we're on the right track.

That elephant should be spectacular.

I care for the show, now I have someone
needed that allows for the elephant.

August olifantenman want you to be.

You alone will train Rosie.
With increase in salary.

A modest increase in salary.
You notice you do not agree.

I know nothing about elephants.

Shall we tell him the truth?

A group of us will eat carcass
if we the people entry.

And I mean a crowd on their feet
falls to us to come inside.

That elephant must make. She has to.
I gotta tell you something.

I do not know if you remember me familiar
after you have heard.

Cornell I've never finished.

I am not a real vet. I have
no diploma. I have no license.

Do you think Lucinda, the fat lady,
400 weighs?

Up to 200.

Do you think the lady her getatoerde
has tattoos of headhunters in Borneo?

She is from Pittsburgh.
Those tattoos, because she did about nine years.

Tell him about the hippo.

When she died, we did formaldehyde
in her water and let her see...

last two weeks we traveled
with a stuffed hippo.

The world is run with tricks.

Everyone plays.

It is a true talent.
A gift you can give a diploma.

You have such talent.

A Look at Silver Star and you knew it.

You must learn, dear boy...

that the rules of the 'United Bastards'
not apply to us.

On talent and illusion.

On Rosie.

On Rosie.
In everyone we love.

Softly, dear.
We have a guest.

You squeeze too hard.

I'm here.

Come to bed.

Excuse us, Jacob.

Is everything okay?
Yes, he has too much to drink.

Bessie Smith.
I wish I was able to sing.

Should I leave?

No, I want to dance.

A dance, then you go home.

Was it fun tonight?

August can you really like.

He can use a friend.

We both.

That's a nice song.

"Tell him what happened."

No, I would never do.

So hot that song.
"Tell him what has happened to me."

That song?
Yes.

Go ahead.

I think you should go.

Exactly.

Good night.

Bravo, Queenie.

This is my new friend...

and roommate, Jacob.

I want you all to ensure
that he feels at home.

I want you to feel at home.

Hello, beautiful.

What did I do last night?

You gave to Barbara.

Your balls itch?

Yes.

Thank you did.

It is growing again.
Bundles.

What happened to Queenie?
Why?

She hates me anymore.
There is something wrong.

She must have eaten something wrong.
Give her some honey from the kitchen...

and if you can some ground oak bark.

If that fails, we can tomorrow
see if they have parasites.

My real name is Walter.

Good morning.

I had forgotten how great you were.

Want to work?

Go easy on me today.
I'm not really in shape.

Do you want to walk?

Rough party I've heard.

The most I lost it.

The rest of those guys apparently do not.

About last night...
It was champagne.

What?
You're not familiar with it.

If a woman tells you right in your face,
do not like you forget it.

Good.

I meant what I said
about friends.

What are you doing?

Good morning, children.
Good morning, darling.

Where were you?
I was early for her to practice.

Your charms seem to work well
to that yearning for love pachyderm.

Too bad they are with Barbara
not have worked well.

Barbara?

Rumor has it that you did not,
but you did it on his "Cornell's" tried.

Can we please continue?
Of course.

Cornell, if you work with an elephant,
you need absolutely no charm.

Every living creature needs to know
who's the boss.

They smell when a man
power at its strongest.

And if that is not.

First, you start anything with an elephant
Gaddafi stick.

And with that, you have the role of master
claim immediately.

You use it just above her shoulder.

You use a loud voice for the command.

Run.

Rosie, run.
Put her.

They must know that you mean it.

Rosie, run.

Run. Come on.

Rosie, run.

Look at me.
Backwards.

Ladies and gentlemen and children
of all ages.

Welcome to the most buitensporigste
extravagance...

that the human eye can comprehend.

Welcome the stars
The Benzini Brothers...

the most spectacular show in the world.

Okay?
I landed wrong on my heel.

Grab the elephant before we left the city
off. Forget elephants do not stick.

The boys go into town.

I'll help. Come on.

Sorry.

Sorry.

Is yours.
We will be there for.

Thanks.
Pay my cabbage.

They love to drink.

One sip of this and she thinks
no more grain.

This I got from Wade and Grady.
The master gives me enough.

Pay, sir.
I will.

That is wasted on such a pachyderm.

My leg.

Follow them?
Yes.

Good.

Okay?
Fine. My joints hurt.

A bruised heel.
It'll be fine.

August wants to drink something.
You take some. To relax.

Did you catch that elephant?

Eventually she got back in the car.

Good.

Do not.

She did well.
She came back alone.

She needs more time.
She was not ready.

Stop.
Stay down.

I mean it.

You do need a lot of whiskey.

I do not understand why such a man
near animals want to be.

If you ask me he has no right.

Marlena.

Marlena has sent you?

No.

She does not see me.
She will not talk to me.

This time she forgives me.

Maybe you can talk to her?

There is no excuse for what I did.

Rosie is okay?
She needed whiskey.

Here, take everything but what I have.

Take it.
Do you want to tell Marlena.

What?
I saw her go up to the elephant...

and run away with her,
then I lost my mind.

I know this is no excuse.

I've already spent the money to the elephant.

I have to work with it.
I have to repay debts.

I have to sell tickets.

The elephant we can no longer use.

Marlena If I lose, you lose
I get this all.

What was your plan, stick with that elephant?

Is this too much?
Soon she is drunk.

She weighs four tons.
She is just sleepy.

They can thus have hardly move.
It'll be fine.

I do not know what to do.

The next time he will kill her.
You can not do.

Thus a man throws people off a moving train
so he does not have to pay.

You'd think he think twice
God's innocent creatures to murder.

Give me that other cloth at once.
Under your feet.

Put your leg up.

Read it aloud to Rosie.

It helps if he "please" says.

Say...

What does this mean?
Try it now but.

Next.

In the only authentic miracle of success.

This removes all sins.

Do not you think? Only the thought.
Put all things right.

Anyway, on Rosie...

our great big, beautiful
bullseye of a star.

I still need more champagne.
You got it.

No, sit down.
It's my party.

It is good to see him like.

Seems that from now on
only his pitches.

You know how many star attractions we have
had to pack them?

How much money we earned
and lost?

Earned and lost.

Silver Star paid our new track.
Look what happened to him.

Why do you do with him?

I was born in a train.

I lay wrapped in newspaper under
a chair in the Baltimore Ohio.

I was only three days old.

I grew up in foster care.
I always dreamed about who my parents were.

When I was five, I did one year long
though my mother was an Appaloosa.

Really.

And I had a foal.
I dreamed that when I was a girl.

And one day I woke up
and then would run home.

I was safer than in those stables
home I've ever been.

Then came the circus in town.

And there were those six wonderful
black horses.

Red tassels hanging in their manes.

It was so beautiful.
August and went in front.

As soon as he looked at me, I knew
I never would live with strangers.

So I got married.

And where I finished?

In a train.
The only home I ever knew.

And you know I'm the star.

Not there.
I have nothing.

Just like everyone else.

You're a beautiful woman.
You deserve a wonderful life.

So it's just.

Where were you when I was 17?

Let's dance.

Robbery.

Robbery.

Jacob.
Hold it.

This way.

You okay?
That was close.

My stockings.
They are also of silk.

How do we find our way back?

If we do not find it August?

We should probably go look for him.

Follow me.

I told myself to let her go.

August to say that I lost
was in the crowd...

was the best.
The best for everyone.

I could not do it.

I convinced me that I had to stay
to protect Rosie.

In order to protect Marlena.
You could not trust August.

The truth was that I might
The man who could not be trusted.

There is something wrong with Camel.

Hello, boy.

Nice to see you.

What is it?
I do not know.

I woke up this morning and
zwabberden my feet.

I feel they are not good.

That's not all.
There are also other things.

Down there?
Things Men?

What is wrong with him?
An alcohol leg.

I've seen.
Nonsense, doctor?

Plastids are installing it in...

the loophole that Jamaican
ginger extracts are not sold as beverages.

That stuff you should not drink.

What should I drink that shake
counter?

It is prohibition.
I'm not a millionaire.

Tomorrow we get paid.
We take care of drinks.

Do not lie to him. You get paid.
Blackie has nine persons discharged.

That can not be true.

Nine men have disappeared
between Goshen and Weehawken.

We have not stopped.

Will he get better?

As Earl of Camel as Blackie sees it's over.

We need to keep him out of sight.

About one week he may have legs
do not move.

He told me that he has a son,
in Reading.

We are about three weeks.

He needed only three weeks.

Blackie and his men watch
not in my closet.

Good morning.

May I sit?
Of course.

Can we talk confidentially?

Why? Is something wrong?

I wanted to apologize
for what happened last night.

What weird.
Why would you apologize?

You were not even there.

August I have explained everything.
As far as I remember something.

With the champagne I'm not in his right mind.

There was a crowd.
They began to push.

I fell and tore my stockings.

Good morning, children.

That was quite an adventure last night.

Thanks, Paulie.

I do not have to pay bail for you.

How did you get home?

By ferry.
Great.

And cheap.
Fine, man.

I have slept last night.

Thanks, honey.
August, not in public.

You have nothing to be ashamed.
Man and woman united in the marital bed.

This is a sacred act.

My Marlena has forgiven me.

The world looks good again.

No, in a circle.

Wonderful, Jacob.

I was really worried last night
to you two.

If something happens to Marlena...

if anyone hurt her or something,
or touch her but...

I should not think.

Bring her back.

Up.

If August already knew something about that night
could you not notice.

He seemed just to Rosie
to worry.

Out of love she played her role
without batting an eyelid.

We all did.

Everything was as it was before.

So it seemed.

But nothing was the same.

August was again right.

Everything is an illusion.

All seats were sold out.

August promised the men that he
would finally pay them.

With interest if his debts
would be paid.

Success of August had a new man
made, they all said.

But, I looked at him and knew that
but it would be a matter of time.

The circus is nothing without its traditions.

It's a family.
And as with any family...

when a new family member that is born must
celebrated. And we should be grateful.

We were all busy
sold out performances.

Praise the Lord.

This morning, for the show,
I wish we were together.

We do our eyes closed.

And we owe, who is there
also above for steering...

of desperate men to the track.

Because it was a happy day
When Jacob Jankowski...

jumped on our train.

It is because of his discovery,
the biggest star that we have...

in the history of
The Benzini Brothers.

Therefore...

We welcome him officially welcome
in our family...

We do our eyes open...

and we give him the traditional
Gasoline Brothers baptism.

Congratulations, Jacob.

Rosie bring to my tent
and tell it to anyone.

Where do you want her?

There. That's perfect.

I have a surprise for August
preparing.

I've never been so happy having company.

Maybe we can Ringling Brothers
still repay.

Do you need anything?

No thanks.

A handkerchief.

What is this?
For you. A surprise.

Congratulations, honey.
Thanks, honey.

Where you going, Jacob?

It's for you.
Join us.

Of course.

In August. A man who performed miracles
by making me a star.

Thanks.

Thank you both.

Sorry I was so early and so
ruining the surprise.

I can go outside again.
Then you have more time.

Or better yet, I can raid 'call
and everyone will flee.

That's an idea for the show.
A new number.

It goes like this.

A first dance.
Two people.

A remarkable young man, hopelessly
love with a woman beyond his reach...

who plays games with his affection.

We start with a romantic melody
them on the dancefloor swing.

He does his arms around her.

He does his arms around her.

Do me a favor.
I'm inspired.

The public will love it.

Now they look into each others eyes.

August...
Look at him.

She touches his cheek.

Puts her hand gently on his neck...

and plays with his hair.

Always keeps her eyes on him.

Let him believe that it is his own.

He let his hand slide lower.

And lower, under her plea.

But, she gives him a blow.

As if to defend her honor
against that insolent Don Juan.

The audience will love it.
They love the illusion.

They will never think that you do not honor
have to protect.

August, please.

It's funny how things
prove.

I always knew what
kind of woman you really are.

Sit in front of your dress.

To watch the parade.

That little girl with eyes that do not
knew what to do.

With such a beautiful almost transparent skin.

Clear to me.
I could always see through.

I'm sorry that I say,
you're pretty ordinary.

Marlena, we gotta go.
Is this the plan?

You leave me for him?
No.

You must be special.
Please, August.

If he does nothing for you,
say that I should sack him.

Sack him.

Tell me I Blackie and his men
on him to release him a lesson...

so he does not touch my stuff.
It's okay, Marlena.

Go away, Jacob.

A disagreement in grades.

Betrayal is beyond lust.
That sell your cards with.

August, look at me.

I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here.

Do you want me to leave?
No.

But, I'm your wife.
Not one of your things.

Prove it.

Look at me.
There is nothing wrong. Can you hear me?

I'm never leaving you.

An innocent woman would naturally
must not kneel.

You can not help it.

It is a habit for a woman like you.

Baas, spectators.

Go away, otherwise it will be much worse.

I trade it off.

The only thing you now stay afloat
are spectators.

August hatred witnesses.
What did you do?

I leave her with him.

Come back. Close the door.
I must find her.

If you go outside, he shoots you down.
Nobody can stop him.

You just got fired.
So you're an intruder.

Is everything okay?

The girls learned that August Blackie
instructed...

to follow you to go if we went riding.

Make sure you're rid of the train.

Hurry.

We are not far from a hotel.

Stay no longer than one night.
Come with me.

You think there is nothing out there for you.
That is there. You just do not see it.

You do not understand.
I can not. He finds me anyway.

Marlena, there's a better life
that is for you.

Or that living with me or not.

Whether you love me or not.

It does not matter.

It must happen now.

How long have I slept?

We can not stay here.
We must continue.

Do not worry.

We take the best first bus.

We go to Ithaca, I exam...

We tackle each job in
until I get my license.

Then we go to Ringling.

You will not just at Ringling.

You can not just eat them.

Not if we offer ourselves as a team.

You as an artist, I as a veterinarian.
Nice outfit.

Do you think they take?

No.
There's nobody on.

Ladies and gentlemen. This way.
Follow my voice. Do not be shy.

Enough time for the big show starts.

Jacob, it's good.
I do not have much time.

Where are Walter and Camel?
They jumped off the train last night.

August was crazy. He Blackie's men
all night search.

Wade and Grady were lucky
and found Walter and Camel.

They were on the rocks cases.

They did not make it.

Wade and Grady take August to address.
I do not know how, but you have to leave.

I seem to matinee begins here.

Then I go to town.
There will be a church or so.

That is there.

You do your number.

Come to me when the show starts.

August will not know that you're gone for
the second song starts...

so we have a lead.
I gotta go.

Promise me you will.

Otherwise I'll get you.
I swear.

I'll be there.

I love you.

Ladies and Gentlemen
and children of all ages.

Welcome the stars
the Benzini Brothers...

most spectacular show in the world.

Take Queenie.

The tigers have escaped.

Official reports
August was trampled.

Blackie was not seen when
Grady Wade and dragged him out of that tent.

No one was accused of being
those animals from their cages had left.

According to police, it could be anyone.

The Benzini Brothers were officially bankrupt.
Ownership of Altona Pennsylvania.

The other smell that soon enough circuses
and then take our remnants along.

I would not expose Rosie.
Nobody would ever have her touch the stick.

As I was going, I did my exam...

and my diploma was a Ringling
nice thing with our animals and Marlena's number.

Our first son was born that season.
Walter.

He spent his first seven years
at Ringling by, so I can not...

understand why he did today
not come.

There was a circus in town.

By the time our third son
was born, we had enough.

Rosie retired.

Luckily the vet to
the Albany zoo death...

So I got that job.

We bought some land. The horses could
keep Rosie and five children.

Before you know it, the kids borrowing
the car and leave.

When we were alone with Rosie.

When Rosie died...

Marlena cried for days.

We had our whole life thanks to Rosie.

And Marlena?

Marlena is dead in her bed.

Still beautiful.

We have been together many years.

I do not know how, but I find everything
given what I had ever promised.

And boy, that was life.

I tell you.

You take me?

I do not know.
What about your health?

Nothing wrong with me.
I'm just old.

Work is the best against old age.

A man like me to work
at a cash register...

not trapped
like a freak show.

If you think that I can not cost
deserve, call it home then.

They will not argue.

You will not regret it.

We have put you in the record book.
The oldest man who ran away with the circus.

I'm not running.

I come home.
