MISS KAPP THAT CLEARLY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MISS KAPP?

HER NAME MUST BE KAPLINSKY
IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

OH, NO, SHE COULDN'T... I'M
NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND ARGUE.

JUST TELL ME WHY IN THE WORLD YOU

I JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE

WE CAN'T HAVE HER KIND

NOW I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO DISMISS HER...

AND PRAY GOD SHE DOESN'T GO RUNNING

FOR GOD'S SAKES, MAN. GET SOME
GLASSES, STUDY WHO YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.

I WILL, I WILL. AFTER
WORK THIS EVENING.

TAKE THE DAY IF YOU HAVE TO.

OH.

BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T FEEL
IT'S ANYTHING PERSONAL, DO YOU?

OH, GOD, NO, MR. GARGAN. NO.

<i>[Man On Radio] WHY

SOMETHING ABOUT THEM.

WHAT, MOTHER? WHAT?

YOU LOOK JEWISH. COULDN'T
YOU GET THE RIMLESS KIND?

I... I TRIED THOSE TOO.

THEY ALL DO THE
SAME THING TO ME.

THESE ARE BETTER THAN
ANY ON THAT ACCOUNT.

<i>OH, WELL. I DON'T SUPPOSE
ANYONE WILL NOTICE.</i>

DON'T SUPPOSE.

HOW'S MR. GARGAN? HE'S JUST FINE.
MR. LORRING IS IN FOR A WEEK OR SO.

LORRING?

HE'S HERE FOR THE ANNUAL
REVIEW OF PERSONNEL.

HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

<i>[Women] GOOD MORNING,

GOOD MORNING, MR. LORRING.

SEND IN MISS HART, PLEASE. <i>[Woman

[Clears Throat]

PSST.

<i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>

GERTRUDE HART. HELLO.

HELLO.

SIT DOWN, MISS HART.

I AM. THANK YOU.

UM... UM...

<i>HOW LONG WERE YOU WITH
THE SPANCHER COMPANY?</i>

<i>UH, WELL, I WORKED
THERE ABOUT THREE YEARS.</i>

MM-HMM. MM-HMM. AND
HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?

THREE YEARS. I...

OH. I'M SORRY. I...

<i>AS YOU, UM... I'M SORRY.</i>

I'M SORRY.

<i>[Chuckles]</i>

DO YOU HAVE, UH, UH... HAVE YOU
EVER USED AN ELECTRIC TYPEWRITER?

ONCE IN A WHILE. I HAD A CHANCE TO
USE ONE. WE ONLY HAD ONE IN THE OFFICE.

<i>IT WASN'T BIG LIKE THIS PLACE.</i>

<i>[Lorring] JOHN, I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE A WORD WITH THAT NEWMAN.</i>

MM-HMM. YES.

I ASSUMED YOU HAD THAT.
<i>UH, NO, I UNDERSTAND.</i>

I CAN RUN ONE PERFECT
WITH ONE DAY'S PRACTICE.

IT'S EASY TO LEARN HOW TO RUN
THEM IF YOU'RE AS GOOD A TYPIST AS ME.

WE PREFER PEOPLE WHO...

I WAS BORN EPISCOPALIAN,
MR. NEWMAN, IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING.

<i>BUT YOU ARE WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE, RIGHT?</i>

I'M TOO MUCH OF A LADY TO
TELL YOU WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

EVERY PLACE I GO, IT'S
THE SAME STUPIDITY.

I'VE HAD SECRETARIAL JOBS
WHERE I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO TYPE.

<i>YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD JOBS.</i>

WHAT'S THE USE?

YOU KNOW WHAT THEY OUGHT TO DO TO
PEOPLE LIKE YOU? THEY OUGHT TO HANG YOUSE.

WAIT. MISS HART?

<i>[Door Closes]</i>

COULD YOU SEND IN THE
NEXT APPLICANT, PLEASE?

MISS BLANCHE BOLLAND.
YES, MR. NEWMAN.

<i>[Man] GOOD NIGHT.</i> GOOD NIGHT.

<i>[Lawrence] SEE YOU MONDAY.
HAVE A NICE WEEKEND.</i>

LAWRENCE.

UH, MR. LORRING HAS BEEN LAYING
OUT A BIT OF REORGANIZATION.

I WON'T GO INTO
DETAILS RIGHT NOW, BUT...

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MOVE YOUR DESK INTO HOGAN'S OFFICE.

HOGAN'S OFFICE? MR. LORRING
THINKS THE BEST THING WOULD BE...

FOR YOU AND HOGAN TO
SORT OF SHIFT POSITIONS.

JOBS? WELL, YES,
SHIFT JOBS. EXCHANGE.

NOW, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW THAT
HOGAN'S NOT MAKING YOUR SALARY,

BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CUT YOU.

YOU'LL KEEP MAKING
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

AT PRESENT. IS THERE
SOMETHING I'VE DONE...

OH, NO, NO, IT'S
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

BUT HOGAN HASN'T BEEN HERE
BUT FIVE YEARS, MR. GARGAN.

I'VE BEEN HERE OVER 20 YEARS. I UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL, LAWRENCE.

I WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IN HIS POSITION.
HOGAN DOES IMPORTANT WORK.

BUT WHY? MR. GARGAN, HAVEN'T I
DONE MY JOB? I GOT MY GLASSES.

I JUST HIRED A FINE GIRL. MR. LORRING
AND I JUST FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER...

FOR EVERYBODY CONCERNED IF YOU
WERE TO WORK IN MR. HOGAN'S OFFICE.

NOW, THERE'S NO RUSH,
BUT, UH, TRY TO HAVE

YOUR THINGS MOVED BY
THE FIRST OF THE MONTH.

MR. GARGAN, I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HARM I'D BE DOING IN MY OFFICE.

FRANKLY, I HAVE TO SAY THAT
I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING...

UNTIL MR. LORRING DREW MY
ATTENTION TO IT, BUT I CAN SEE HIS POINT.

WE DON'T THINK YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT IMPRESSION...

<i>ON PEOPLE WHO MIGHT COME INTO
THE OUTER OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME.</i>

<i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE TO TELL YOU, FELLA.</i>

MR. GARGAN, I DON'T THINK I
CAN ACCEPT THIS EXCHANGE.

IT'S NOT AS IF YOU DON'T
KNOW MY BACKGROUND.

MR. LORRING DOESN'T
KNOW BUT WHAT HE SEES.

AND MR. LORRING HAS THE RIGHT
TO HIS OWN IDEAS, DOESN'T HE?

I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THEN.

I'M NOT SAYING LEAVE.
I'M SAYING SHIFT JOBS.

SLEEP ON IT. THERE'S NOTHING TO
SLEEP ON. I'LL HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

THINK IT OVER.
THERE IS NOTHING
TO THINK OVER!

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE, MR. GARGAN!

DINNER'S IN THE OVEN, MA'AM,
AND I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

HELLO, DEAR. HANG YOUR JACKET UP
AND COME IN AND SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE.

I'LL COME DOWN AFTER I'VE
SHOWERED. GOOD NIGHT NOW.

GOOD NIGHT.

â™ªâ™ª [Big Band]

<i>[Footsteps]</i>

<i>YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THE OTHER
NIGHT, DID YOU, DEAR?</i> HEAR ANYTHING WHEN?

THE OTHER NIGHT. NO. WHY?

AHA. I THOUGHT NOT.

<i>I TOLD THE POLICE YOU'D HAVE SAID
SOMETHING IF YOU HAD.</i> WHAT POLICE?

<i>A POLICEMAN CAME
BY THIS MORNING...</i>

PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE
MAKING INQUIRIES ALONG THE BLOCK.

INQUIRIES ABOUT WHAT?

<i>SOMEONE IN THE
HOSPITAL. A WOMAN.</i>

<i>SHE WAS BADLY BEATEN.
SHE'S IN CRITICAL CONDITION.</i>

AND HE SAID THAT SHE
MAY HAVE BEEN RAPED.

WHY WAS HE ASKING HERE?

WELL, APPARENTLY SHE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A NEWSSTAND ON THE CORNER.

<i>YOU KNOW THE WAY I SLEEP. I
TOLD THEM I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING,</i>

<i>AND NOR HAD YOU OR YOU'D HAVE
TOLD ME IF YOU HAD, I TOLD 'EM.</i>

OF COURSE.

DID HE ASK ANYTHING ELSE? <i>NO.</i>

EXCEPT... EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS FOUND
LYING IN THE STREET OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

<i>SHE SLIPPED INTO A COMA, AND
NOW SHE'S CRITICAL, THE POOR THING.</i>

<i>A PUERTO RICAN I
THINK HE SAID SHE WAS.</i>

THOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT A PUERTO
RICAN WOULD BE DOING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

NO. I WONDER.

<i>HE SAID SHE HAD
NO IDENTIFICATION.</i>

â™ªâ™ª [Continues]

OH, LAWRENCE.

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
WATER THE GRASS BEFORE DINNER.

OTHERWISE IT'S
GONNA BURN UP SURE.

<i>[Man] GET THAT WATER
GOING.</i> JUST GETTIN' TO IT.

<i>[Man] WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?</i>

<i>[Fred] JESUS!</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª [Calliope]</i>

<i>[Dogs Barking]</i>

SUNDAY PAPER! BUY
AMERICAN, MISTER.

JUST A MINUTE.

WHAT'S GOING ON, FRED?

JUST MAKING SURE BILLY HERE
GETS HIS RIGHTS. THAT'S ALL.

MONEYBAGS OVER THERE WAS
TRYING TO PUSH HIM OFF THE BLOCK.

IS THAT SO? IMAGINE
THE NERVE OF THAT KIKE.

<i>[Billy] PAPER, MISTER?</i>

SURE.

I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
HAVE TO MAKE 'EM SO THICK.

HEARD YOUR DOGS LAST
NIGHT. ANYTHING WRONG?

<i>[Fred] MUST'VE BEEN THE MOON.</i>

<i>THERE WAS A FULL MOON LAST
NIGHT. DID YOU NOTICE THAT, CARLSON?</i>

<i>[Carlson] YEAH. [Newman] THEY
REALLY BARK AT THE MOON, EH?</i>

<i>[Fred] SURE. YOU
NEVER HEARD OF THAT?</i>

NO, I NEVER DID. IS THAT A
SCIENTIFIC FACT? <i>IT'S A FACT.</i>

I READ ABOUT THIS SCIENTIST
WHO SAID WE'D BE TRAVELING...

TO THE MOON IN ROCKET SHIPS
AFTER THE WAR. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

ANYBODY WHO TRIES THAT
WOULD BE SMASHED TO PIECES.

I BETTER GET HOME. MY
MOTHER'S WAITING FOR HER PAPER.

THANKS, MISTER.

SEE YA!

GRANDMA, MOM'S ON THE TELEPHONE.

YOU OUGHTA BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

ASHAMED, I SAY!

WAS THAT MRS. DEWITT SHOUTING?

YES. HER GRANDDAUGHTER'S OVER FOR
THE DAY. UP TO SOME MISCHIEF, I SUPPOSE.

THIS ISN'T THE<i> CITIZEN.</i>

I DIDN'T GET YOU THE<i> CITIZEN.</i>
FINKELSTEIN WAS SOLD OUT.

<i>DIDN'T HE SAVE ONE FOR YOU? YOU KNOW
THAT I PREFER THE</i> CITIZEN<i> ON SUNDAYS.</i>

[Indistinct Chattering]

THE INVASION'S ON.

<i>[Newman] SO I SEE.</i>

<i>GOT YOURSELF SOME NEW SPECS, EH?</i>

I CAN SEE A MILE AWAY. IT'S
'CAUSE... 'CAUSE I EAT VEGETABLES.

THAT'S WHY DOGS EAT GRASS WHEN
THEY START TO LOSE THEIR SIGHT.

I THOUGHT THEY ATE
GRASS FOR CONSTIPATION.

CONSTIPATION LEADS TO BAD SIGHT.

I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
<i>SURE. NEWMAN.</i>

CAN YOU READ THE SIGN
ON THAT TRUCK DOWN THERE?

<i>"ORCHARD STREET, MOVING AND
STORAGE. 629 ORCHARD STREET."</i>

<i>ORCHARD STREET. THAT'S
THE LOWER EAST SIDE.</i>

THAT'S THE ELEMENT THAT
HE'S BRINGING IN DOWN HERE.

CARLSON BET ME THIS MORNING
YOU'D BUY FROM HIM. FROM FINKELSTEIN?

I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T. WE'RE GONNA HAVE BILLY
ON THAT CORNER EVERY SUNDAY FROM NOW ON.

SWELL.

YOU WERE IN THE ARMY,
WEREN'T YOU? YEAH.

23rd INFANTRY. THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT.

PETEY TOLD ME THAT YOU GOT
YOURSELF A FRITZ ONCE. IS THAT TRUE?

YEAH. YEAH, I GOT A FRITZ.

HOW WAS IT? HOW'D YOU GET HIM?

DID YOU GO UP TO HIM AFTERWARDS
AND SEE WHERE YOU GOT HIM?

WAS IT ONE SHOT? IT'S SOMETHING
I DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT.

YOU KNOW WE'RE PLANNING TO PUT THE
FEAR OF GOD INTO THEM HYMIES, DON'T YOU?

WE'RE GONNA DRIVE 'EM OFF THE
BLOCK. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

WE GOT A REALLY BIG
ORGANIZATION HERE, NEWMAN.

YES? YEAH, AND WHEN
THE BOYS GET HOME,

THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR AN
ORGANIZATION THAT GIVES 'EM WHAT THEY WANT.

THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE STANDING FOR A LOT OF
KIKES TAKING ALL THE JOBS AND BUSINESSES.

NO, I GUESS NOT. NEWMAN,

WE'RE GETTING MORE
PEOPLE IN EVERY DAY.

AND WHEN WE GET ENOUGH, THAT'S
WHEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUR MOVE.

WE'RE GETTING ONE OF THEM
MEETINGS UP PRETTY SOON AGAIN.

YOU GONNA COME THIS TIME OR NOT?

YE... SURE. YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS.

YOU'LL JOIN THE ORGANIZATION.
'CAUSE IF WE ALL STICK TOGETHER,

WE CAN CLEAN UP THIS SITUATION.

WE CAN KNOCK THEM
OVER LIKE TENPINS.

YOU WANNA JOIN?

EVERYBODY ON THE BLOCK
WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU...

CARLSON, PETEY, EVERYONE.

NEWMAN,

WE WANT YOUR CLASS OF PEOPLE.

THIS MORNING, CARLSON WAS
WILLING TO LAY A REAL BET...

THAT YOU'D BUY FROM FINKELSTEIN.

HE THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE TYPE. WHAT TYPE?

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BUT
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, NEWMAN.

YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE ON
THE BLOCK I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH.

HAVING TROUBLE WITH ME? YEAH,
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

I... I GOTTA WALK MY
PUPS, NEWMAN, OKAY?

I'M BUILDING A MODEL SAILBOAT
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

YOU SEE THE LIGHT ON,
YOU COME IN, OKAY? OKAY.

YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, NEWMAN.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

I'LL SEE YOU LATER. <i>YEAH.</i>

<i>[Man] OH, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A POSITION WITH US?</i>

I'M INQUIRING, YES. I WONDERED
IF YOU HAD ANYTHING IN MY LINE.

I SEE. WELL, JUST
WHAT IS YOUR LINE?

I'M PERSONNEL. I HIRED MOST OF THE
PEOPLE IN THE LAST COMPANY I WAS WITH.

I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
FOLKS HAD ANYTHING OPEN.

FRANKLY, TRUTWELL ISN'T LOOKING
FOR ANYONE IN PERSONNEL RIGHT NOW.

THAT'S QUITE ALL
RIGHT, MR. STEVENS.

I'M JUST GOING OVER THE
GROUND FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

<i>I STOPPED BY BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF OUTFIT WHO WOULD BE USING...</i>

<i>MY TYPE OF MAN.</i> OF COURSE.

I'M DOING A SORT
OF LAY OF THE LAND.

I HOPE YOU'LL COME SEE US AGAIN IF
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING MEANWHILE.

BE HAPPY TO, MR. STEVENS.

<i>AND THANKS FOR THINKING OF US.
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS AGAIN?</i>

<i>NEWMAN. LAWRENCE
NEWMAN. GREAT, GREAT.</i>

<i>WELL, I HOPE YOU COME UP AND
SEE US AGAIN. I'LL GIVE YOU A TRY.</i>

YES. YOUNG WILLIE DOYLE.

WELL, HE'S BEEN WORKING JUST A
BLOCK FROM ME ALL THESE YEARS,

AND WE NEVER KNEW IT.

NO, NEITHER OF US KNEW IT.

WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED HERE
AND I WON'T BE LATE, ALL RIGHT?

ALL RIGHT.

SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE
GOT YOURSELF A FINE POSITION.

ACTUALLY, I'M IN CHARGE
UNTIL THE WAR'S OVER ANYWAYS.

CHIEF'S IN THE NAVY.
SO, HOW 'BOUT YOU?

I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE CHANGED QUITE A LOT. HAVE I?

I DON'T THINK I WOULD
HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU.

WELL, YOU HIT 40 AND... [Chuckles] I
GUESS. YOU NEVER GOT MARRIED.

NO, NO, NEVER HAD THE TIME.
WORKING. PAYING OFF THE HOUSE.

HOW'S THE JOB?
YOU STILL OVER AT...

NO. UH, ACTUALLY I DECIDED
TO MAKE A BREAK FINALLY.

ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING FOR
ANOTHER PLACEMENT. IS THAT SO?

HOW LONG YOU BEEN OUT?
SINCE JUST THE OTHER DAY.

YOU JUST STARTED LOOKING?
YEAH. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

I JUST WONDERED IF YOU KNEW OF ANYTHING
AT YOUR PLACE. I'M IN PERSONNEL, YOU KNOW.

SAY, I DO KNOW A
PLACE FOR YOU TO TRY.

I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE NAME
OF THE COMPANY THAT HE'S WITH.

I SAW HIM ON THURSDAY AND HE SAID
HE'S LOOKING FOR A MAN IN PERSONNEL.

STEVENS. COLE STEVENS AT
THE TRUTWELL CORPORATION.

<i>THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE
MAN YOU WANT TO SEE.</i>

I THINK THEY'RE
OVER THERE ON 37th...

I KNOW WHERE THEY
ARE. BELIEVE ME. ANYWAYS,

YOU WANNA GET THERE FIRST THING,
BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

I-I-I WILL. I'LL GET THERE FIRST
THING. LET ME KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

YES, I WILL, WILLIE. THANK YOU.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU TAKE CARE. YEAH.

<i>â™ªâ™ª [Calliope]</i>

[No Audible Dialogue]

<i>[Newman] I'M LAWRENCE
NEWMAN, MR. STEVENS.</i>

<i>I'M A CHRISTIAN PRESBYTERIAN. DO YOU
WANNA SEE MY BAPTISMAL CERTIFICATE?</i>

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! YOU
DARE NOT DO THIS TO ME, GODDAMN IT!

I AM NO ONE BUT LAWRENCE
NEWMAN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!

MISTER, ARE YOU OKAY?

YES.

<i>[Fred] YEAH. I'LL DO ANYTHING
THAT YOU SAY, MEL. ANYTHING.</i>

<i>[Fred] YEAH. YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU KNOW.</i>

<i>THEY ARE DOING IT RIGHT IN
GERMANY. WE GOTTA GET IT RIGHT. YEAH.</i>

<i>CLEAN OUT THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, RIGHT?</i>

<i>ACTION. YOU'VE GOT
TO HAVE ACTION, MEL.</i>

<i>YOU'RE OKAY, MEL. YEAH, YOU'RE
OKAY. [Phone Clatters In Cradle]</i>

<i>[Carlson] WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL HIM WE GOT A LIST?</i>

<i>WE GOT NAMES AND ADDRESSES. WE
KNOW WHAT TO GO AFTER, WHO TO HURT.</i>

<i>WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
HIM ABOUT THE LIST?</i>

<i>[Fred] BECAUSE, CARLSON, HE'S COMING
TO SUPERVISE THINGS PERSONALLY.</i>

<i>[Carlson] MEL'S GONNA
SUPERVISE. [Dogs Barking]</i>

<i>[Fred] SHH!</i>

<i>WHO'S THERE?</i>

OKAY, SETTLE DOWN.

WHO'S THERE?

<i>[Dogs Barking] [Fred]
COME ON, BOYS.</i>

<i>[Newman] GOOD-BYE, MOTHER.</i>

<i>GOOD-BYE, DEAR.</i>
SEE YOU AFTER WORK.

THEY KICKED MINE AROUND
TOO. WHO'S DOING THIS?

WHO ALWAYS DOES IT?
THE UNION CRUSADERS.

IT COULD HAVE
BEEN SOME CHILDREN.

I DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP TILL 1:00
LAST NIGHT, AND GOT UP AT 5:00.

BETWEEN 1:00 AND 5:00, YOU DON'T
FIND CHILDREN IN THE STREETS.

BUT YOU GOT NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT, MR. NEWMAN.

BY YOU, IT WAS PROBABLY
A MISTAKE. WELL, IT MUST BE.

IF IT WAS EARLIER IN THE NIGHT,
I MIGHT HAVE HEARD SOMETHING,

LIKE THE NIGHT THAT
WOMAN WAS BEAT UP.

YOU SAW THAT? NO, BUT
I HEARD THE SCREAMS.

IT'S HARD TO TELL
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

YOU KNOW, I TOLD THE POLICE.

THEY WERE ASKING PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOOD TO TRY AND IDENTIFY HER.

NO PAPERS, NOTHING. NO FAMILY.

SO I DID MY DUTY. I WENT
ROUND TO THE HOSPITAL,

BUT, UH, I NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

<i>IS THERE A POSITION OPEN?</i>

EVENING, MR. NEWMAN.
GOOD EVENING, MRS. DEWITT.

NEWMAN. HEY, NEWMAN.

<i>[Woman] HELLO, MR. NEWMAN.</i>

FRED!

YOU DIDN'T BY ANY CHANCE SEE ANYONE
IN MY GARBAGE CANS THE OTHER NIGHT?

GARBAGE? YEAH.

ONE WAS TURNED OVER. GARBAGE
ALL OVER THE LAWN. REALLY?

<i>NO, I DIDN'T... I
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.</i>

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT, LARRY.

<i>SORRY.</i>

<i>[Door Opens]</i>

<i>[Woman] MR. NEWMAN.</i> YES.

YOU CAN GO IN NOW.

<i>WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?</i>

MR. ARDELL'S GONE OUT AND I'M
TAKING OVER UNTIL HE GETS BACK.

IF YOU WANT, YOU
CAN WAIT FOR HIM.

SOME MEN DON'T LIKE TO BE
INTERVIEWED BY WOMEN. NO, I DON'T MIND.

YOU WANT TO WORK HERE?

I WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING
HERE FOR A PERSON OF MY EXPERIENCE.

YOU DON'T NEED YOUR
EXPERIENCE FOR THIS

PLACE. ALL THEY DO IS
ASK IF YOU'RE A CITIZEN.

JEWS, NIGGERS, WOPS. ANYBODY.

YOU THOUGHT I WAS A JEW. I
WANT TO APOLOGIZE, MISS HART.

I WAS UNDER TENSION THAT DAY.

I CAN IMAGINE.

I... I HAD ORDERS. I
COULDN'T TAKE THE CHANCE.

THAT COMPANY DOESN'T
HIRE THEM. THEY NEVER

HIRED ANY SINCE THE DAY
THEY OPENED THEIR DOORS.

NONE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYHOW.
I CAN'T HIRE YOU MYSELF. <i>I... I...</i>

I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT!

I... I'M...

I'M... I'M JUST SO PLEASED TO HAVE
RUN INTO YOU AGAIN, MISS HART.

I'VE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT YOU SINCE THAT DAY.

PLEASE, BELIEVE WHAT I SAY.

I REALLY HAVE.

YEAH?

YEAH.

I'VE BEEN HAVING
A HARD TIME SINCE...

WELL, TO TELL THE TRUTH,
SINCE THE DAY YOU SAW ME.

I, UM... YOU SEE, I HAD TO...

WELL, FRANKLY, I HAD
TO QUIT THAT POSITION.

THEY WERE GOING TO
TRANSFER ME TO A CLERK'S JOB.

WHY?

THEY SEEM TO FEEL THAT
SINCE I GOT MY GLASSES...

I DON'T MAKE THE KIND OF APPEARANCE
THEY WANT IN THE FRONT OFFICE.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THEN?

I KNOW JUST WHAT YOU MEAN.

I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET PLACED,
AND IT'S THE SAME EVERYWHERE I GO.

SURE, THEY'RE ALL MORONS. YOU'LL
NEVER GET ANYWHERE WITH 'EM.

THAT'S WHAT I'VE DECIDED.

HOW'D YOU KNOW THIS
PLACE WAS JEWISH?

IT IS?

DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

WELL, THE NAME.

MEYER IS A JEW.

YOU DON'T WANNA
WORK HERE NOW, HUH?

<i>YOU BETTER WANT TO.</i>

<i>YOU'RE IN A BAD WAY
YOURSELF, MR. NEWMAN.</i>

I CAN SEE THAT NOW MYSELF.

CAN YOU?

OH, YEAH.

IT'S THERE, ALL RIGHT.

I'M SORRY THAT I...
MISTOOK YOU THAT WAY.

IT'S ALL RIGHT. GOD, IT
WASN'T THE FIRST TIME.

LISTEN.

THE REASON I BLEW UP
AT YOU IS I THOUGHT YOU...

YOU KNOW.

YOU REALLY DID? <i>YEAH, I
DID. I THOUGHT YOU WERE.</i>

WHAT? YOU THOUGHT I WAS WHAT?

JEWISH.

OH.

I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY...

THAT YOU WERE WHAT?

MR. NEWMAN,

I CAN'T HIRE YOU.

<i>BUT IF YOU COME BACK IN ABOUT AN
HOUR, I'LL TELL MR. ARDELL ABOUT YOU.</i>

IS THERE A POSITION OPEN?

WELL, IT ISN'T EXACTLY YOUR OWN
LINE, BUT IT'S A DECENT KIND OF JOB.

<i>THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A
MAN WHO CAN INTERVIEW</i>

<i>PEOPLE WHO COME INTO
THE COMPANY TO SELL THINGS.</i>

<i>IT'S KIND OF A SALES
TRAFFIC CONTROL THING.</i>

THE COMPANY'S BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS, AND I
GOT AN IDEA IT'LL BE AN AFTER-THE-WAR JOB.

UNLESS THE WHOLE COUNTRY
CLOSES DOWN OR SOMETHING.

YOU'LL COME BACK?
OH, YES.

YES, UM... YES. IN
AN HOUR, YOU SAY?

YEAH.

MAKE IT ABOUT AN HOUR.

I'LL RECOMMEND YOU.

YEAH? <i>YEAH.</i>

THANKS. THANK YOU, MISS HART.

CHALK IT UP.

HEY, LARRY!

WILLIE. HOW ARE YOU?

VERY WELL. DID YOU SEE STEVENS?

NO. I'M ALL SET UP AT
MEYER-PETERSEN. MEYER-PETERSEN?

IN NEW JERSEY. HOW
LONG YOU BEEN THERE?

<i>THREE WEEKS NOW. THREE
WEEKS? HOW'S IT GOING?</i>

<i>IT'S SWELL. IT REALLY IS.</i>

EXCUSE ME, WILLIE. MY DATE.

[Wolf Whistle]

UH, GERTRUDE, WILLIE DOYLE.
WILLIE, GERTRUDE HART. HI, WILLIE.

HI.

LOOK, I GOTTA GO MEET A FRIEND, BUT
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

BYE, WILLIE. IT'S A
PLEASURE. WHOO!

I WANNA WALK.

WHAT DO YOU DO FOR
EXCITEMENT USUALLY?

NOT MUCH. I'VE BEEN PRETTY BUSY
MOST OF MY LIFE JUST WORKING.

SOME HAVE IT ALL
AND SOME GOT NOTHIN'.

THAT'S THE TRUTH, I GUESS.

ALTHOUGH, I'VE HAD
MY SHARE OF THINGS.

LIKE WHAT?

OH, A NICE HOME
AND A... GOOD JOB.

BUT YOU DIDN'T EVER HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH YOU, LAWRENCE.

THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS
PICKED ACTORS. THEY

MAKE A DOLLAR AND SPEND
A DOLLAR TWENTY-FIVE.

<i>[Woman Giggling]</i>

[Both Chuckle]

SO, UH, ARE YOU GONNA
KEEP TAKING ME OUT?

WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO? SAY YES
OR NO. I'M NOT THE HARPOONING TYPE.

WELL, OF COURSE I
WOULD... I WOULD LIKE TO.

I JUST, I WONDERED
WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

MMM, YOU GOT ALL
THE ANSWERS, RIGHT?

YES, I WOULD LOVE
TO. [Chuckles] HEY, WAIT.

<i>DID YOU LIKE IT IN HOLLYWOOD?</i>

<i>I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU IN A PICTURE.
I THINK YOU'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL.</i>

NAH. I GOT THE WRONG
TYPE OF BEAUTY.

I GOT A TEST, BUT THEY
THOUGHT I LOOKED TOO TRAGIC.

SO, WHATEVER THAT MEANS. ANYWAY,

I WAS THERE ABOUT TWO YEARS
AND I WORKED FOR THIS MAN...

WHO OWNED A DOG MANICURING
PLACE... YOU KNOW, WASHING AND CLIPPING.

HE WAS ALL RIGHT
TO ME... FOR A MAN.

THAT'S WHEN I FELL IN
LOVE WITH THIS ACTOR.

I BROUGHT MY MOTHER OUT
FOR THE WEDDING. FROM WHERE?

HOME. BUFFALO.

I GOT SEVEN SISTERS.
THEY'RE ALL MARRIED.

BUT I'M THE OLDEST. THE MA.

HE DIDN'T MARRY
YOU? NOT EVEN MAYBE.

HE JUST LIT OUT, YOU KNOW.

ANYWAY,

I WENT BACK TO
BUFFALO, YOU KNOW,

TRIED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WENT WRONG.

DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN BUFFALO?

WHAT, YOU DON'T BELIEVE
ME? YEAH, I-I BELIEVE YOU.

YEAH? OF COURSE.

YEAH. LIKE YOU BELIEVE
EVERYTHING I SAY, RIGHT?

YEAH.

OH, LAWRENCE, THAT'S...


OH, GOD!

<i>WHA-WHA... WHOA!</i> [Laughing]

NO. I MEAN, IT'S NOT
ALLOWED. COME ON!

WAIT. WHA... <i>COME ON!</i>

WE'RE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE.

YOU... HEY.

YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING? WHAT?

I'M THINKING WHAT I'D SAY IF
YOU ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU.

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

I'D PROBABLY SAY NO.

WHY? WHY WOULD YOU SAY NO?

I'D PROBABLY RUIN YOUR LIFE.
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
RUIN MY LIFE?

<i>DANCIN'. I LIKE TO DANCE.</i>

YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE ME
OUT DANCIN' ALL THE TIME.

I'D TAKE YOU DANCING
ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

I NEVER DID STUFF
LIKE THAT BECAUSE,

WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH THE
KIND OF WOMAN WHO APPEALED TO ME.

REALLY, GERTRUDE, I NEVER
STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU.

IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU FOR YEARS.

THAT'S WHY YOU STRUCK ME
SO THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU.

NOW YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

MARRY ME, GERTRUDE.

ALL RIGHT. WHEN?

WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO?
TWO WEEKS FROM SATURDAY.

ALL RIGHT.


I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU HOME TO MEET
MY MOTHER. DO YOU THINK SHE'D LIKE ME?

OH, I'M SURE SHE WILL. SHE'S BEEN WANTING
ME TO GET MARRIED FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

SO, IS SHE RELIGIOUS? NOT FANATIC, BUT
WE'D HAVE TO GET MARRIED IN A CHURCH.

THAT'S THE ONLY
PLACE. ABSOLUTELY.

HOLD IT.

IT'S HOT.

<i>[Fred] WHEN ARE WE
GONNA CUT THE CAKE?</i>

HOW YOU DOIN'? WOW.

<i>FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS?</i>

THANKS.

THAT'S IT!

<i>[Giggling] WHAT DO YOU THINK?</i>

<i>[Giggling]</i> MMM.


YES.





AND THAT'S WHEN I
LOOKED UP AND I SAW FRED.

<i>[Newman] FRED'S HOUSE, AND
I SAW ELSIE IN THE WINDOW.</i>

<i>I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS WEARING.</i>

<i>IT-IT SURE LOOKED ODD TO ME.</i>

[Doorbell Rings]

YOU'VE GOT A RETURN? YES.

<i>[Fr. Crighton On Radio] GOOD
CHRISTIAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS...</i>

GOOD MORNING, FRED.

MORNING.

GOING TO THE COUNTRY
FOR THE WEEKEND.

I GO OUT WITH THE
DOGS SOME DAYS.

FRED, YOU GOT A LIGHT? SURE.

<i>[Crighton] WE ARE
REACHING THE END OF THE</i>

<i>MOST HORRIFIC WAR IN
THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.</i>

<i>OUR SONS, OUR BROTHERS...</i>

I USED TO LISTEN
TO HIM BEFORE. WHO?

FATHER CRIGHTON. YEAH, I WAS
GOING THROUGH SOME BAD TIMES.

FELT LIKE HE WAS TALKING TO ME
PERSONALLY. <i>[Newman] BYE, MOTHER.</i>

MADE ME BELIEVE IN GOD AGAIN.

GAVE ME HOPE, YOU KNOW?

YEAH, HE'S A GOOD MAN.

I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
IT SOMETIME. NICE TALKING TO YOU.

<i>[Applause On Radio]</i>

READY? UH-HUH.

THANK YOU.

<i>[Radio Audience] FATHER!
FATHER! FATHER!</i>

<i>[Engine Starts]</i>

SOMETHIN'. WHAT'S THAT?

IT'S ABOUT BUFFALO.

I WASN'T BORN THERE. I WAS
BORN AND RAISED IN STATEN ISLAND.

BUT I ALWAYS SAID BUFFALO SO
EMPLOYERS WOULDN'T THINK I WAS A JEW.

IT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND.

YEAH? YOU MAD ABOUT WANAMAKERS?


I-I JUST DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
$100 DRESSES DELIVERED FROM STORES...

WHEN YOU KNOW WE
HAVE TO SEND THEM BACK.

WHY? EVERYBODY DOES IT.

COME ON. I JUST WANTED TO TRY
SOME THINGS ON AT HOME FOR YOU.

WELL, YOU HAVE
EXCELLENT TASTE, GERT.

NO, R-REALLY. I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU COULD LOOK LIKE THAT.

LIKE AN ACTRESS. YEAH?

YEAH! EXCEPTIONAL TASTE.

WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I PRIDE MYSELF ON.

OOH! GET OVER HERE.

COME ON.

WISH WAS WITH US? FRED.

WHY FRED? HE SEEMS NICE.

IT WAS NICE OF YOUR MOTHER
TO INVITE THEM TO THE RECEPTION.

YOU KNOW, NEIGHBORLY. WE
OUGHTA GET TO KNOW THEM BETTER.

I DON'T KNOW. I THINK HE'S
THE ONE WHO TURNED OVER...

WHAT? WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

THERE IT IS, GERT.

<i>[Gertrude] OH, LOOK!
I'M SO EXCITED.</i>

<i>[Giggles]</i>

OH, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

<i>[Woman] TALKING ABOUT
ORGANIZING A BRIDGE GAME.</i>

VERY NICE CROWD HERE.

HELLO. THERE'S A YOUNGER COUPLE.

[Gertrude Chuckles] LEAVE
THESE RIGHT HERE.

ALWAYS SOMEONE INTERESTING TO
TALK TO HERE. NICE, LIVELY CROWD.

I WANNA TAKE A SWIM
BEFORE LUNCH. <i>YES, SIR?</i>

HI. UH, LAWRENCE
NEWMAN. YES, SIR.

I CALLED LAST WEEK. I TALKED
TO A YOUNG MAN, A MR. SULLIVAN...

ABOUT A FRONT ROOM.

HE TOLD US YOU'D BE ABLE
TO HELP US. A RESERVATION?

NO. HE SAID THERE'D
BE NO PROBLEM.

YOU CAN'T GET
ANYTHING HERE. FULL UP.

OH.

<i>UM, IS MR. SULLIVAN AROUND?
I'M SURE HE'D REMEMBER ME.</i>

UH, HE'S SWIMMING, BUT
HE COULDN'T HELP YOU.

HE'S MY SON. I OWN THE PLACE.

OH. I JUST THOUGHT HE'D REMEMBER
ME. I WAS HERE FOR TWO WEEKS.

MISTER, WE'RE FULL UP.

I COULDN'T HELP
YOU IF I WANTED TO.

WE'LL GO ON TO THE
OTHER ONE THEN, LAWRENCE.

WE WANTED TO SAVE ON
GAS. THAT'S WHY WE TRIED YOU.

I'D BE GLAD TO HELP YOU
IF WE WEREN'T SO FULL UP.

OH, YEAH, WE KNOW. WE SAW THE MOB
OUT THERE. WHAT, WITH 12 CARS OUTSIDE.

HOW'D EVERYBODY ELSE
GET HERE? BY YACHT?

I SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY, LADY.

JUMP IN WITH YOUR SON
AND DROWN, WILL YA?

<i>LET'S GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE WE GET
SQUEEZED TO DEATH BY THE MOB IN HERE.</i>

<i>[Birds Chirping]</i>

<i>[Gertrude] YOU WOULD THINK HE
COULD'VE THOUGHT UP A GOOD EXCUSE.</i>

CROWDED. I WANTED TO CHOKE
HIM. DON'T TAKE IT TO HEART.

YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE ANYMORE
WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING.

JUST GO TO ANOTHER PLACE, LULLY.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WE'RE GOING HOME.

NO! I WANNA GO TO ANOTHER PLACE!

I WANNA GO TO ANOTHER
PLACE! STOP THAT!

WHAT... LET ME OUT! LULLY!

JUST LET ME OUT!
STOP THE CAR! STOP IT!

I'M NOT GOING HOME! STOP
IT! WILL YOU CALM DOWN?

I WANNA FIND ANOTHER PLACE. NO!
I'M NOT GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

AND I DON'T WANT YOU
INSULTED EITHER. TURN AROUND!

THEY'RE ALL RESTRICTED
HOTELS ALONG HERE.

IT'LL BE THE SAME NO
MATTER WHERE WE GO.

THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED
TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

GOT THE RIGHT TO DO
ANYTHING THEY WANT.

BUT THEY'RE WRONG, AND YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD HIM THAT! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM?

TELL THEM WHAT,
GERT? TELL THEM WHAT?

IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE THAT ATTITUDE
WITH YOU, YOU CAN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING!

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN TELL THEM?

THEY PULL THAT ON ME
AND I TELL 'EM WHAT I AM.

NOBODY MAKES A JEW OUTTA
ME AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.



THERE'S A-A LITTLE STATE
PARK UP THE ROAD HERE.

WE'LL HAVE LUNCH.
WE'LL SIT BY THE LAKE.

I DON'T WANNA SIT BY THE LAKE. I
CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN TODAY!

NOW STOP IT!

<i>[Newman] DO JEWS EAT CLAMS?</i>

NO SHELLFISH.

HAVE YOU DECIDED? YES.

CLAMS. MY WIFE WILL HAVE CLAMS.

AND I'LL HAVE CLAMS TOO. A
LARGE ORDER OF CLAMS FOR TWO.

THAT'S AN ORDER OF CLAMS FOR
TWO, SIR. OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE?

NO, NOT JUST YET.
WE'LL SEE AS WE GO.

OKAY.

WE'LL TURN AROUND, WE'LL DRIVE BACK
DOWN THE ROAD FOR A COUPLE OF MILES.

WE'LL FIND ANOTHER PLACE.
MUST BE ANOTHER PLACE.

OKAY.

I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING TO HIM.

<i>[Gertrude] NO! NO! THAT'S
TOO COLD! I DON'T CARE.</i>

CALL. TWO OF A KIND.

FULL HOUSE. OKAY.
[Gertrude Laughs]


THOSE ARE PERFECT.
[Gertrude Laughs]

WAIT! [Laughs]


IT'S USUALLY OPEN ON SUNDAY.

<i>SOMETHING MUST'VE HAPPENED.</i>

HELLO? MOTHER, WE'RE HOME.

<i>[Mother] OH, HELLO, DEAR.</i>

I'LL GO PUT THE CAR
AWAY. ALL RIGHT.

HI.

DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

YES, WE DID. WE HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

SO I FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME THAT
FINKELSTEIN GOT IN A FIGHT WITH SOME GUY...

OVER THAT KID WHO SELLS
NEWSPAPERS ON SUNDAY.

WAS HE HURT? NO.

THEY FELL AGAINST A
WINDOW AND IT CRACKED.

SHE SAID SHE SAW IT FROM HERE.
THE WHOLE BLOCK WAS WATCHING.

SHE TOLD ME ABOUT FRED.

THE TWO OF YOU USED TO GET TOGETHER AND
TALK, VISIT WITH EACH OTHER IN HIS CELLAR.

YOU DON'T DO IT ANYMORE? MM-HMM.

AND HE'S A UNION CRUSADER? I
KNOW HE'S A UNION CRUSADER.

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT, LULLY.

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT HE INVITED
YOU TO A MEETING AND YOU DIDN'T GO.

AND ABOUT THE GARBAGE CANS.

I ASKED FRED ABOUT
THE GARBAGE CANS.

AND WHAT DID HE SAY? HE
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

OH, LULLY! THAT'S
PART OF THEIR TACTIC.

FIRST WITH THE GARBAGE CAN, AND
THEN THEY BLOW OUT A WINDOW OR TWO.

NOT MY WINDOW, THEY'RE NOT.

WHO ARE THEY?
I DON'T KNOW.

I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM
BEFORE. HE'S HAVING A MEETING.

<i>[Dog Barking]</i>

OH, EXCUSE ME. IS THIS 144?

NO, JUST NEXT DOOR.

THANKS A LOT.

COME INSIDE.

THERE'S SOME THINGS
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

AND MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE, BUT THERE
ARE THINGS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME EITHER.

WHAT THINGS? WHAT HAVEN'T I
TOLD YOU? ABOUT THE GARBAGE CAN.

AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE UNION
CRUSADERS ARE ALIVE AROUND HERE.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT.

WE GOTTA STOP
FOOLING AROUND HERE!

YOU EITHER GET IN WITH
FRED AND YOU JOIN THE

UNION CRUSADERS, OR
WE GET OUT NOW AND FAST.

GET OUT OF... WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT AM I
TALKING ABOUT? I JUST TOLD YOU.

AND YOU HEARD ME. LOOK.

I WAS OUT SHOPPING, AND I HEARD THE PEOPLE
TALKING ABOUT THIS MEETING NEXT SATURDAY.

LULLY, YOU SHOULD GO.

I DON'T KNOW.

ALL RIGHT, DON'T GO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

<i>BUT WE GET IN OR WE GET
OUT. THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE.</i>

HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THE UNION CRUSADERS?

I JUST KNOW, OKAY?
HOW?

THAT GUY I TOLD YOU I WORKED FOR
IN HOLLYWOOD, THE DOG GROOMER...

I LIVED WITH HIM, LULLY.

<i>I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE, SO I STAYED.</i>

<i>I STAYED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.</i>

LULLY,

HE'S A UNION CRUSADER.

<i>SO I HEARD A LOT.</i>

<i>THEN THEY STARTED
BEATIN' UP ON JEWS,</i>

<i>AND THE POLICE CAME AROUND.</i>

<i>I'D HAD ENOUGH, SO I GOT OUT.</i>

BUT I DIDN'T GET OUT BEFORE I
GOT TO KNOW THOSE PEOPLE, LULLY.

THAT FAT GUY WE SAW DOWNSTAIRS,

<i>I SAW HIM IN L.A.</i>

<i>HIS NAME'S MEL.</i>

HE'S REAL IMPORTANT
WITH THE CRUSADERS, LULLY.

THEY DON'T BRING
HIM IN UNLESS THEY...

IT'S GONNA GET REAL DANGEROUS.

<i>OKAY? THEY GOT
RIFLES, THEY GOT BOMBS.</i>

<i>FRED'S GOT RIFLES.</i>
FRED GOES HUNTING.

<i>AND REVOLVERS, LULLY? YOU
GO HUNTING WITH REVOLVERS?</i>

THEY'RE DRAWING
A RING AROUND US.

<i>NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS,
BUT THEN WE HAVE TO MOVE RIGHT NOW.</i>

BUT WE'RE NOT JEWS!

OH, LULLY, LISTEN TO ME.

IT ISN'T FAIR,

BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

WHEN THEY MAKE UP THEIR
MIND ABOUT WHO YOU ARE,

IT'S OVER.

SO YOU GO TO THE MEETING
OR YOU GET OUT NOW.

<i>OH, GOD.</i>

<i>[Clattering Noise]</i>

<i>[Dog Barking]</i>

LET'S GO.

<i>[Car Departing]</i>

<i>[Crickets Chirping]</i>

<i>[Whistle]</i>

<i>[Chattering]</i>


<i>[Police Dispatcher] CALLAHAN
PETE'S, 221 FLATBUSH.</i>

<i>TWO MALE NEGROES,
POSSIBLY JUVENILES.</i>

BOB, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

<i>EXCUSE ME. THAT'S
SAVED. I'M SORRY.</i>

<i>[Man] THERE HE IS.</i>



FATHER! FATHER!

FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER!

YOU MUST BE FRED.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

FATHER! FATHER! FATHER!

FATHER! FATHER! FATHER!

THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

<i>THANK YOU! PLEASE BE SEATED!</i>

I COME TO YOU
TONIGHT, GOOD PEOPLE,

IN THE TERRIBLE
HEAT OF THIS DAY,

TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO
FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT...

AGAINST THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN
PROPAGANDISTS,

AND TO STAND FAST... FAST...

AGAINST THE INTERNATIONALIST
WARMONGERS...

<i>DETERMINED TO CRUCIFY
CHRIST ALL OVER AGAIN!</i>

STAND FAST!
YES! YES! YES!


<i>THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY...</i>

<i>WHEN 95 PERCENT OF
OUR FELLOW CITIZENS...</i>

HAVE THEIR MINDS AND
EMOTIONS AROUSED BY ONLY...

FIVE PERCENT OF THESE
INTERNATIONALIST WARMONGERS,

<i>WHOSE MAIN CONCERN IS THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE...</i>

IN THE SERVICE OF COMMUNISM!

<i>[Man] YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!</i> BOO!

<i>THIS IMPENDING MENACE MAKES IT
NECESSARY FOR US TO SOLIDIFY...</i>

<i>A CLOSELY WOVEN UNION CRUSADE...</i>

TO BLUDGEON THIS ASSAULT BY
THESE INTERNATIONALIST BANKERS...

AND THEIR WARMONGERING
COMMUNIST BROTHERS!

<i>[Cheering] AND WE ALL
KNOW WHO THEY ARE!</i>

<i>[Man] JEWS! JEWS!</i>

<i>NOW WE MUST BE
DILIGENT IN ROOTING OUT...</i>

<i>THESE MAGGOTS THAT FEED
ON THE ULCERS OF CIVILIZATION,</i>

<i>AND GROW FAT ON THE
DOCTRINES OF ZIONIST GREED...</i>

<i>AND MARXIST ATHEISM!</i>

<i>WE MUST BE RESOLUTE IN
DENYING THESE PARASITES...</i>

<i>THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAX FAT...</i>

<i>ON THE WOUNDS OF OUR PROSPERITY!</i>

<i>[Cheering]</i>

<i>BUT, BUT, BEFORE I CONTINUE,</i>

DEAR BRETHREN AND CO-PATRIOTS,

BEFORE I CONTINUE, I
SHOULD LIKE TO INFORM...

NAY, WARN YOU... THAT THERE
ARE AMONGST US TONIGHT...

<i>HOW SHALL I SAY IT? THE
INTERNATIONALIST PRESS.</i>

<i>YES! LOOK AROUND YOU!</i>

<i>I THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO TELL A
NATIONALIST FROM AN INTERNATIONALIST.</i>

<i>I SUSPECT THESE
PRESS PEOPLE WILL...</i>

GIVE US DUE ATTENTION
IN THEIR NEWSPAPERS.

AND WE MUST STEEL OURSELVES FOR
EXCLAMATIONS OF DISSENT TONIGHT.

AND SHOULD ANY SUCH
DISSENT BE NOTICED,

I TRUST YOU WILL
RESTRAIN YOURSELVES...

<i>AND DEAL WITH ANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS
AS BEFITS OUR CHRISTIAN VALUES.</i>

AMEN!

<i>AS YOU ALL KNOW,</i>

<i>WE ARE CLOSE TO THE END OF
THE MOST BRUTAL WAR IN HISTORY.</i>

<i>A WAR TO WHICH MANY OF YOU...</i>

<i>HAVE LOST BROTHERS,
HUSBANDS, FRIENDS.</i>

<i>AND I TELL YOU, WHEN
OUR BOYS COME HOME,</i>

WE WILL RISE UP AGAINST THE
MONEY-GRABBERS WHO STARTED IT!

AND OUR BYWORD WILL
BE<i> ACTION</i>! ACTION! ACTION!

ACTION!
ACTION!

ACTION! ACTION!

<i>STAND UP, MISTER!</i>

<i>NOW FRIENDS, PLEASE!
PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN!</i>

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
YOU? HE DIDN'T CLAP ONCE.

FOR PETE'S SAKE, I NEVER
CLAP. HE'S A JEW, A SAMMY.

YOU'RE OUTTA HERE! STOP IT!

<i>[Fr. Crighton] SIT DOWN! PLEASE
GO BACK TO YOUR SEATS! PLEASE!</i>

LET US EXERCISE SOME
CHRISTIAN COMPASSION.

LISTEN TO ME!

<i>[Door Slams]</i>

MY NAME IS LAWRENCE NEWMAN!

MY FAMILY CAME FROM
ALDWICH, ENGLAND IN 1861!

ALDWICH, ENGLAND,
FOR PETE'S SAKE!

MY-MY ANCESTORS
WERE PILGRIMS, EVEN!

PROTESTANTS! PRESBYTERIANS!

I... LISTEN!

YOU BETTER GO HOME, MISTER.

WELL, I... I... YOU HURT?

NO, NO, BUT THEY'RE OUT OF
THEIR MINDS. THEY'RE CRAZY!

<i>CAN'T THEY SEE? I'M NOT A HEBE!</i>

BETTER GO HOME NOW.

MR. NEWMAN. CAN I HELP YOU?

UH, UH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE YOUR
JACKET OFF. IT DON'T LOOK NICE.

ARE YOU GOIN' HOME?

I'D LIKE TO WALK WITH YOU, IF
YOU DON'T MIND MY COMPANY.

I SEEN THERE WHAT HAPPENED.

I FIGURE THAT THEY'LL COME TO ME
ANYWAY, SO FIRST I'LL GO TO THEM.

I STOOD OUTSIDE. I SEEN
WHAT THEY DONE TO YOU.

FIRST, I'M ASKIN' YOU
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

I'M... I'M AFTER INFORMATION.

I AM A MAN WHO READS EVERY
DAY, SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS.

ALL KINDS, FROM COMMUNIST
TO THE UTTERMOST REACTIONARY.

IT'S MY NATURE I
SHOULDN'T BE HAPPY...

UNLESS I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS GOING ON.

WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS HOW SO MANY PEOPLE...

CAN GET WORKED UP TO
SUCH A PITCH ABOUT JEWS,

WHEN IN THAT WHOLE HALL THERE AIN'T A
PERSON WHO KNOWS HIMSELF PERSONALLY...

MAYBE MORE THAN
THREE JEWS TO SPEAK TO.

MOST OF THEM AREN'T
VERY INTELLIGENT.

YEAH, BUT SOME THERE LOOK
MORE INTELLIGENT THAN ME.

I-I WANNA LAY THINGS OUT
ON THE BOARD, MR. NEWMAN.

IF YOU DON'T MIND, YOU
CAN DISCUSS WITH ME.

WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO GET
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

IT ISN'T YOU, PARTICULARLY.
IT IS ME PARTICULARLY.

IF YOU WANT THE JEWS TO GET
OUT, YOU WANT ME TO GET OUT.

I DID SOMETHIN' YOU DON'T LIKE?

IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF DOING
SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE. YES, THEN, WHAT?

YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO KNOW THIS, DO YOU?

WHY, DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL
ME? NO, I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU WANT.

THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE JEWS.

UH, FOR ONE THING, THEY HAVE
NO PRINCIPLES. PRINCIPLES?

YES. IN BUSINESS, FOR INSTANCE,

YOU'LL FIND THEM CHEATING
OR TAKING ADVANTAGE.

LET ME UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT ME NOW?

NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOU. SOME, YOU MEAN.

OF COURSE I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

THEN SOME GENTILES, NO?

OF COURSE, YES.
SOME GENTILES, YES.

YOU EVER PUT A NICKEL IN FOR A
LOCAL CALL? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

THE PHONE COMPANY COULD MAKE
A GOOD PROFIT CHARGING A PENNY.

THIS IS A FACT FROM THE
UTILITIES INVESTIGATION.

THE PHONE COMPANY IS
RUN AND OWNED BY GENTILES,

BUT SHOULD I HOLD
YOU RESPONSIBLE?

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT ISN'T WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

IT'S WHAT OTHERS OF
YOUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE.

SO, IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT ME, YOU DON'T SEE ME.

I DON'T SEE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I MEAN WHAT I SAID.

YOU LOOK AT ME AND
YOU DON'T SEE ME.

SO WHAT DO YOU SEE, MR. NEWMAN?

I...

WHAT HAPPENED? YOU'RE
ALL DIRTY. I'LL WASH LATER.

LAWRENCE, YOU'RE CUT! I WAS
SITTING THERE WITH SOME MORON.

HE STARTED YELLING AT ME.

WHY? WHAT'D YOU
DO? I DIDN'T DO A THING.

HE-HE SAW I WASN'T APPLAUDING.

I NEVER APPLAUD. YOU KNOW
THAT. <i>BUT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?</i>

HOW CAN YOU TELL
THOSE MORONS ANYTHING?

THEY WENT CRAZY
AND SHOVED ME OUT.

SO YOU DIDN'T STAY TO THE END?

THEY PUSHED ME OUT,
FOR PETE'S SAKE! RIGHT.

YOU SHOULD HAVE APPLAUDED.

WHY? WHY SHOULD
I HAVE APPLAUDED?

THEY'RE ALL MORONS.

<i>[Crickets Chirping]</i>

[Doorbell Rings]

<i>[Car Approaches]</i>

<i>TAKE CARE.</i> OKAY,
YOU TOO. GOOD NIGHT.

<i>I WANT TO SEE YOU, FRED.</i>

WHO'S THAT?
IT'S ME.

SIT DOWN A MINUTE, WILL YOU?

YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

WELL, UH, WHAT DO
YOU WANT, LARRY?

I COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING, NOW COULD I?

I JUST DON'T WANT TO
BE MOLESTED AGAIN.

MISTAKES HAPPEN.

THEY JUST GOT EXCITED,
LARRY. THEY JUST GOT EXCITED.

AS EXCITED AS THEY GET WHEN THEY
THROW MY GARBAGE ON MY LAWN?

I TOLD YOU,

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE GARBAGE ON YOUR LAWN.

OH, COME ON, FRED!

YOU SAW IT THE FIRST TIME, WHEN YOU
WALKED YOUR DOGS BEFORE I GOT UP.

BUT LET'S STOP FOOLING
AROUND, ALL RIGHT?

LET'S BE HONEST, ALL RIGHT?

ALL RIGHT.

WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO, LARRY?

I WANT MY NAME
TAKEN OFF THE LIST.

I KNOW YOU GUYS KEEP A
LIST, AND I WANT MY NAME OFF.

A MAN DOESN'T GET
GARBAGE TWICE ON HIS LAWN...

OR GET ATTACKED LIKE
TODAY, UNLESS HE'S A JEW.

AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT, FRED.

I TOLD 'EM.

I SAYS, THE MAN HAS BEEN A
NEIGHBOR OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME.

BUT THEY CLAIM THAT THEY
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

AND TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, LARRY,

I WAS MAKIN' HEADWAY UNTIL
YOU BROUGHT THE MISSUS AROUND.

GERTRUDE? YOU
THINK SHE'S JEWISH?

YOU MEAN, SHE'S NOT?

NO! WHERE'D YOU
EVER GET THAT IDEA?

OH, GEE, I'M...

I'M AWFUL SORRY,
LARRY. I DIDN'T KNOW.

I THOUGHT YOU'D DONE GONE AND
MARRIED YOURSELF A JEW WOMAN.

I'M NOT GIVING UP
MY HOUSE, FRED.

WHO GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

I'M TALKING, FRED, AND I'M
TELLING YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

I BOUGHT AND PAID
FOR THAT HOUSE,

AND I'M NOT GIVING IT UP!

AND AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,
DON'T KID YOURSELF ABOUT ME.

I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

I CAN TAKE PRETTY GOOD CARE
OF MYSELF, SO DON'T KID YOURSELF!

WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT THAT
WOMAN PETEY RAPED THAT NIGHT.

MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT
ME AND GERTRUDE.

MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT
FINKELSTEIN THERE,

OR MRS. BLYTHE OR MRS. DEWITT.

MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT WHO OF US
WOULD COME OUT TO HELP EACH OTHER...

IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ONE
OF US, LIKE TO YOU, FOR INSTANCE.

OR FRED OR FINKELSTEIN.

<i>YEAH, I'M INCLUDING HIM, LIKE I'M
INCLUDING THAT WOMAN SCREAMING...</i>

WHILE PETEY RAPED HER AND
NONE OF US CAME OUT TO HELP.

WHAT WAS IT ABOUT, CARLSON?

IT WAS ABOUT YOU
AND FRED AND PETEY...

AND ALL THIS GODDAMNED HATRED
GOING AROUND AND AROUND US...

LIKE SOME CRAZY
CAROUSEL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!

THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
ABOUT. ALL RIGHT?


GOOD EVENING AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU?

I WANTED TO ASK
YOU A FEW THINGS.

HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IF THEY COME AFTER YOU?

YOU GOT SOME DEFINITE INFORMATION
THEY'RE GONNA START WITH ME?

WELL, IT'S COMING, ALL RIGHT.

I DON'T KNOW WHEN, BUT IT'S
GOING TO COME. WHAT WILL YOU DO?

THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A
LOUISVILLE SLUGGER. SOLID WOOD.

WHAT ABOUT THE
POLICE? THE POLICE, SURE.

IF WE COULD GET A
DELEGATION TO COMPLAIN.

BUT IS THAT POSSIBLE
ON THIS BLOCK?

MR. FINKELSTEIN,

I'LL GIVE YOU MY HONEST OPINION.

I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE
SENSIBLE THING FOR YOU TO DO.

YES? I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO THINK ABOUT MOVING.

<i>IT'S MY HONEST OPINION.</i>

ARE YOU A JEW, MR. NEWMAN?

NO, BUT THEY THINK
YOU ARE, RIGHT? WELL...

SUPPOSING I TOLD YOU
TO MOVE? MR. FINKELSTEIN,

I CAME TO GIVE YOU MY OPINION.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUYING FROM THEM
ON SUNDAYS BECAUSE THEY MADE YOU BUY.

I THOUGHT NO MATTER WHAT YOU
DID, YOU WERE STILL MY FRIEND...

BECAUSE YOU WERE A MAN OF
INTELLIGENCE. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO...

FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T YOU
SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

THERE'S HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN

THIS COUNTRY, AND A
COUPLE OF MILLION IS JEWS.

IT'S YOU THEY WANT, NOT ME!

<i>THEY ARE A GANG OF DEVILS...</i>

<i>AND THEY WANT THIS COUNTRY.</i>

AND I MUST TELL YOU, IF-IF YOU
HAD ANY REGARD FOR YOUR COUNTRY,

YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME TO MOVE.

I WILL NOT MOVE, MR. NEWMAN.

I WILL NOT DO IT. I WON'T!

I SIMPLY WAS
TRYING... NO, I WILL NOT!

DID YOU TALK TO FRED?

I TALKED TO FRED AND I TALKED TO
CARLSON AND I TALKED TO FINKELSTEIN,

AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE HAVING ANY
TROUBLE WITH OUR GARBAGE CANS ANYMORE.

ALL RIGHT?

I WAS JUST ASKING, THAT'S ALL.

WHY'D YOU TALK TO FINKELSTEIN?

TO WARN HIM TO MOVE.

YOU DID? YOU TOLD HIM TO MOVE?

AND FRED. WHAT ABOUT FRED?

GERT, I TOOK CARE OF THINGS.

ALL RIGHT? PLEASE, DON'T WORRY.

OKAY.

OKAY.

<i>[Crickets Chirping]</i>

<i>[Banging Sound]</i>

<i>HI, ELSIE. HOW'S FRED DOING?</i>

OH, HE'S OKAY. GREAT.

FIVE. THERE YOU GO.

HAVE A GOOD DAY. THANK YOU.

AH. OH, EXCUSE ME. I
THOUGHT I WAS NEXT.

HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON,
MRS. HAMILTON. THANK YOU.

MRS. DEWITT, LET ME GIVE
YOU A HAND WITH THAT.

YOU GO AHEAD, MRS.
NEWMAN. YOU WERE BEFORE ME.

AH. THANK YOU.

<i>THIRTY-FIVE. THANK YOU.</i>

THANK YOU.

HELLO, ELSIE.

OH. I'M SORRY.

I'LL BREAK YOUR HAND IF YOU
PICK THAT UP. YOU REALLY...

DON'T, DON'T. IT'S GONNA BE
VERY PAINFUL WHEN I DO THAT...

AND SAY, "GIN!"

<i>DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS, LAWRENCE?</i>

THAT WOMAN IS STILL IN A COMA.

<i>STILL?</i> YES.

WHO'S THAT?
OH.

JUST SOME WOMAN. THE POLICE THOUGHT
SHE MIGHT'VE BEEN ATTACKED NEAR HERE.

YEAH?

BUT SHE'S PUERTO
RICAN, NOT JEWISH.

SO IT ISN'T, YOU KNOW...

WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

OH, COME ON, GERT. IT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

<i>GERTRUDE,</i>

WE'VE GOT TO START
ENJOYING OURSELVES AGAIN.

I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE, LULLY.

YOU... DO YOU MEAN, MOTHER?

<i>OR...</i> NO.

OR ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

I THOUGHT THINGS HAD CHANGED WHEN YOU SPOKE
TO FRED AND CARLSON, BUT THEY HAVEN'T.

IT SEEMS THEY GOT WORSE.

SOMETIMES I THINK WE OUGHTA MOVE
FROM HERE MAYBE, TO ANOTHER CITY.

NOW, LET'S EXAMINE THINGS, DEAR.

<i>LULLY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA MAKE A LIFE FOR ME.</i>

I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GET TO
STAY HOME AND FIX A PLACE FOR YOU.

I AIN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO
COOK SOMETHING NICE. I COOK GOOD.

<i>I AIN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE
TO HANG UP CURTAINS.</i>

ALL IT'S BEEN IS TROUBLE
AND MORE TROUBLE.
WHAT CAN I DO?

<i>THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT EXACTLY CAN I DO?</i>
GO TO FRED.

GO TO FRED! GO TO FRED! I CAN'T.

LULLY, LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

THEY'RE GONNA TAKE OVER THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD AS SURE AS YOU'RE BORN,

AND I WANNA KNOW WHAT END
OF THE BROOM WE'RE GONNA BE ON.

<i>GOOD NIGHT. [Mother]
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.</i>

DO YOU FEEL THEY HAVE THE RIGHT
TO TELL FINKELSTEIN WHERE TO LIVE?

OR FOR THAT MATTER,
TO TELL US WHERE TO LIVE?

NO, BUT THEY DO.

EVERYBODY ON THE COAST
WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

THEY'LL HAVE SPECIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
FOR ALL OF US, OR EVEN SPECIAL STATES.

OH, NONSENSE.
THEY CAN'T DO THAT.

OF COURSE THEY CAN. LOOK
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN EUROPE!

I AM NOT GETTING DOWN ON MY KNEES
TO FRED OR THAT GANG OF LUNATICS...

FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF
LIVING IN MY OWN HOUSE.

WELL, WHEN THE WAR'S OVER
AND THEY START CRACKING DOWN,

WE'LL FIND OURSELVES FORCED
OUT OF HERE ALONG WITH FINKELSTEIN,

WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT, I'M TELLING YOU.

I'LL GO TO FRED. MAYBE
HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

NO, ABSOLUTELY
NOT. LISTEN TO ME!

I FORBID IT. YOU UNDERSTAND ME?


GERT? GERTIE, COME ON.

LISTEN. FORGET IT. COME ON.

LET'S GO TO THE
MOVIES, ALL RIGHT?

WE'LL WALK OVER,
WE'LL CATCH A MOVIE.

I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

BOTH OF YOU BEHAVE.

DRIVE SAFE.


MUCH. IT'S NICE OUT.

GERT, HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TAKE A LONG TRIP?

TO HOLLYWOOD, SAY?

IT'S CHEAP TO LIVE OUT THERE.

NO, NO. I MEAN, TO VISIT.

IS IT TRUE THAT YOU CAN BUY MAPS
THAT TELL YOU WHERE THE STARS LIVE?

YEAH. BEVERLY HILLS.

[Men Chattering]

EXCUSE ME.

THAT SEEM STRANGE?

NOT PARTICULARLY.

WHY WERE THEY STANDING AROUND
THERE? WELL, MAYBE WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF 'EM? NO.

<i>[Train Whistle Blowing]</i>

<i>[Actor #1] WHAT ARE THEY
GOING TO DO WITH US?</i>

<i>[Actor #2] BETTER WE DON'T KNOW.</i>

<i>[Baby Crying] [Actress
#1] NO, NOT MY CHILD!</i>

<i>NO! [Sobbing]</i>

<i>[Actress #2] THEY CAN'T KILL THE
CHILDREN JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE JEWISH.</i>

WHY NOT? [Chuckles]

WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, IKEY?

<i>[Woman #1] HEY,
WE'RE WATCHING THIS!</i>

<i>[Woman #2] THEY'RE
JUST A BUNCH OF JERKS.</i>

<i>[Baby Crying]</i>

<i>[Train Clattering Over Tracks]</i>

<i>[Crickets Chirping]</i>

GERT, YOU'VE GOT TO
STOP BEING THIS WAY.

I HAVE NOTHING TO
SAY TO FRED ANYMORE.

I CAN'T ACT THAT WAY.

EVEN IF THEY DECIDED
THAT I WAS ALL RIGHT,

I COULDN'T GO ALONG WITH THEM.

AND NEITHER COULD YOU.
YOU'RE TOO FINE A PERSON.

YOU ARE!

TOO FINE.

GERT, I WAS THINKING.

WHEN THE WAR'S OVER, MAYBE
YOU COULD STOP WORKING...

AND WE COULD THINK
ABOUT HAVING A CHILD.

HEY, SAMMY, WHERE YOU GOIN'?

DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM?

WHAT'S YOUR HURRY? HEY!

ALL RIGHT, NOW CUT THAT OUT!

HEY! NO! NO!

LULLY!
RUN!

OH! STOP IT!


OH!


<i>COME HERE!</i>

<i>MR. NEWMAN!</i>
AAH!


<i>[Dog Barking]</i>

AAH!

AAH!

HOLD IT!

ALL RIGHT, YOU HEBE BASTARDS.

THIS WAS A WARM-UP.

I AIN'T FINISHED WITH 'EM YET!
YOU'RE FINISHED! LET'S GO!

COME ON, BOYS, LET'S GO.

SHAKING? SO ARE YOU.

HERE.

EASY.

HOW'S YOUR HEART?

NOT WHAT IT WAS. ICE?

DO YOU HAVE ICE? <i>IN THE BACK.</i>

OVER THERE. OVER THERE.

HOLD IT AGAINST YOUR
NOSE. KEEP YOUR HEAD BACK.

YOUR WIFE? IS YOUR WIFE HOME?

WEDNESDAY NIGHTS, SHE AND THE CHILDREN
AND THE OLD MAN GO VISITING TO THE BRONX.

TO THE... TO THE RELATIVES.

DID IT STOP?

NO, NO, NO. KEEP-KEEP
YOUR HEAD BACK.

<i>I TELL YOU, MR. NEWMAN,
WE WERE LUCKY, HUH?</i>

I'M THINKING OF THAT WOMAN.

SHE DIED TONIGHT, YOU KNOW.

SHE DIED?

YEAH.

I DIDN'T KNOW.

<i>IT'S A TRAGEDY, I MEAN,
WHAT'S HAPPENING...</i>

WHAT'S HAPPENING THESE DAYS.

PEOPLE MURDERING ONE
ANOTHER, NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING.

ANYWAY, WE...

WE SHOWED THOSE BASTARDS
SOMETHING, DIDN'T WE?

YEAH.

WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT?

YEAH.

THANK YOU, MR. FINKELSTEIN.

<i>[Door Opens]</i>

<i>[Closes]</i>

LULLY! OH, MY GOD!

YOUR FACE! WH-WHAT
WERE YOU DOING IN THERE?

I-I THOUGHT FRED
COULD STOP IT FASTER. I...

YOU WENT TO THE WRONG GUY.
I WANNA TALK TO YOU, LARRY.

THAT WOMAN DIED, FRED.

DID YOU KNOW?
IT'S A HOMICIDE NOW.

I KNOW, BECAUSE I SAW
PETEY RAPE HER THAT NIGHT.

SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA
TALK ABOUT, FRED? HUH?

WHAT THE HELL ARE
WE GONNA TALK ABOUT?

<i>[Gertrude] OH, MY GOD.</i>
