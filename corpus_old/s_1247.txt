Thank you for the horse.

You liked him?

Oh, it's beautiful...

but l thought
we were going sailing today.

You promised.

Well, that one's too old.

See, now? That'll do.

Come on!

Come on, Mr. E.

-It's broken.
-Who says?

Mokelock.

Now, Edward, we agreed.

No more Mokelock.

Mokelock is the bogeyman.

Mokelock wants me where l am.

We can fix it.

Edward.

Sing a song of sixpence.

Sing a song of sixpence.

A pocketful of rye.

Four and twenty blackbirds.

Baked in a pie.

Rise and shine.

Mr. E is doing fine.

Did we go sailing?

Almost.

Mokelock showed up.

Mokelock is the bogeyman.

Mokelock wants me where l am.

Mokelock is a pain in the ass.

Where'd he get Mokelock again?

Mother Goose.

-Henry.
-Barry.

What's the matter, Barry?

Edward's parents are here.

He needs a haircut.

He loves it when you visit.

My husband
wonders if that's true.

He wants to place Edward
in the hospital.

I'm sorry, Catherine.

Mr. Baines...

l've been working on
this project for seven years.

I know, Henry.
I know.

Please don't take offense,
Dr. Kent.

Your work's invaluable
to this company.

But you're not sure about me.

We've waited eighteen months
for signs of progress.

There has been progress.

There's no proof, Catherine.

With all due respect,
Mr. Baines...

I'm not the one
who designed the procedure.

I mean, I wish I could take
credit for it, but I can't .

I was chosen to do ajob.
They picked me.

But if you think
there's someone better...

or someone who's more devoted
to your son, then--

No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.

What is it, then?

There's no proof, Catherine.

There's no proof
the procedure works.

All you're giving me
is the belief...

that your interaction
with my son...

is not a...

hallucination.

Shit!

I better get back to work.

Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.

-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. Baines.

Come, shall we? Lucien.

Lucky she worships you.

Why? Because he hates me?

I wouldn't say "hates."

Distrusts,
dislikes immensely...

can't bear the sight of.

What's the verdict?

Well, we've got
another six months...

and Barry had to push for that.

I want to reverse the feed, Miriam...

now more than ever.

We've been through this
a hundred times, Catherine.

it's too risky.

Why not?
What do we have to lose?

When I did social work,
it was always better...

when we took the kids
out of their environment.

Foster homes
can be scary at first...

but eventually they see
that things can be different.

Edward is like that right now.

He--he's living in a world
that is not healthy.

Let's show him
a different place.

All right.
Let's say we do it your way.

We reverse the feed, and
we bring Edward into your mind.

Can you imagine his shock
when he finds...

that he's been thrust
into this whole other world?

-I do it all the time.
-You're a willing participant.

You're aware
of what's happening.

Edward's in a coma.

And be sides, we don't know
what effect it will have on you.

I mean,
you're already exhausted.

-Have you been sleeping?
-Yes.

-Any more nightmares?
-No.

-No.
-Good.

Leave work here.

Don't take it home in this.

Hey, you.

What are you looking for, hmm?

Want some milk?

That's fun. Let me try it.

Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.

Edward, is that you?

Edward, were there sea gulls
being killed on the beach...

while you were sailing?

Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is that you?

Don't be afraid.

No one will hurt you.

Edward, is that you?

Go to sleep.

Help!

Somebody, help me, please!

Somebody!

Help me!

Can you hear me?

Help!

Thanks for waiting, Cole.

Teddy Lee, no problem.

Special Agent Ramsey.

-Cole.
-Morning.

Who found her?

The surveyor for the rail road,
about 6:00 this morning.

Skid marks appear to match
the tire tracks from Reno.

And it looks like he scraped
the rail and lost some paint.

It's on its way to the lab
already.

Dumped the body over there.

Bleach.

Anne Marie Vicksey.

She makes seven.

Jeez, this stinks.

Do they all look like dolls?

Every unfortunate soul.

What's that?

Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.

The way he puts it there?

He makes it for them.

lt makes him feel
they belong to him.

Is the water always this low?

Yeah, this time of year.

Give me a coroner's report
right away.

Preliminary for ensics, too.

l don't want anyone
dragging their ass on this.

So, how was work?

Oh, exhausting.

I have no idea, Jean.
For God's sake.

Good luck with the monster.
I love you, too. I gotta go.

-OK. Thanks. Bye.
-All right. Bye-bye.

Hot off the presses.

There's nothing new to report,
gentlemen.

A match on his semen.

Water in her lungs...

show high levels
of chlorine and rust.

What, pray tell, is this?

They say they found
some dog hair?

From a canine unit?

No. There was no canine unit.

And Anne Vicksey
doesn't own a dog, Teddy.

l want to see this.

What you got, Teddy?

Hypomelanosis.

And that means?

A complete absence of melanin.

The dog is an albino.

He'd love an animal like that.

Gentlemen...

I believe an albino dog
is a rare animal indeed.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

You poor boy.

You're gonna be OK.

Baby, I'm so sorry.

Jesus Christ, Peter.

Thought you were gonna get
some sleep, clean yourself up.

I did.

-They're waiting, you know.
-I'm ready.

Let's go.

We're gonna do this two ways.

Breeders of German shepherds.

Ford dealers.

I want you to be through,
and I also want you to be fast.

This guy's accelerating.

He only waited six days
this time.

When he first started,
months could pass.

And that means
one of two different things.

One, he thinks we're stupid,
and we can't catch him.

Two, which is the one
that I believe...

he wants to be caught.

The dog hair thing is sloppy.

He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey
in three inches of water.

He knew that we'd find her.

Now, there's one thing
I know for certain.

If we can't stop him...

he ain't gonna stop himself.

Will this be all right?

Yes, ma'am, that's great.
Thank you very much.

She was still
living at home, ma'am?

We were looking through an partments.

But they're not
moving in together...

until after the wedding.

Julia wants to be married.

Did she ever mention anything
out of the ordinary?

For instance,
somebody she was seeing mad...

or somebody perhaps watching her
or following her?

Pardon me.

Ramsey.

What if you made a mistake?

Maybe this isn't the man.

Maybe Julia's safe.

There's certain things
that he does...

that make us pretty positive
that this is the man.

Last year,
I lost my husband to cancer.

I went through
such terrible pain.

But Julia,
she was always there for me.

What's going on, Gordon?

Riverside sheriff found
a dog breeder in Woodcrest.

Three years ago,
she had a buyer...

for an albino shepherd pup.

Sheriff checks D.M.V.

Son of a bitch
drives a 92 ford pickup.

-Guess what color.
-Aquamarine.

Ramsey!

-Novak!
-Where is it?

Edison,
just east of Loma Park.

S.W.A.T.'s had the house
under surveillance...

for about twenty minutes.

Carl Rudolph Stargher.

No registered weapons,
no priors.

Got a license for his dog,
though.

Named him Valentine.

You're the bad man,
aren't you, Carl?

Mairzy doats and dozy doats

And liddle lamzy divey

A kiddley divey, too

Wouldn't you?

Brock,
Agent Ramsey, Agent Novak.

We got here as fast as we could.
l briefed them on the way over.

Where do we stand?

Here's the situation.

We got a high-ground team
on the roof...

a four man element to the east.

We got an entry team in the van
across from the house...

a two man element to the south.

Have you seen him yet?

No. There's been some movement
in the kitchen.

Can't tell what it is.

-You think the girl's in there?
-We'll assume she is.

-FBl!
-Go!

Freeze, mother fucker!

I got the dog!

-Clear.
-Clear.

They'll take him
to County General.

Reid's already there.

Make sure he stays cuffed.

I want two men on him
at all times.

I don't want anyone
to treat him but Reid.

Not so much as a thermometer
up his ass, understand?

She's not here.

You should come downstairs.

Mommy!

Please take care
of my little baby!

Please, are you there?
Hello?

Please hear me.

Can you hear me?

l need something.

l need you...

Anybody here?

This is not happening to me.

This is definitely
not happening.

Please help!

Have you ever heard
of Whelan's infraction?

it's a form of schizophrenia.

it's very rare,
and it's very severe.

in any schizophrenic...

these areas would be affected...

but in someone with Whelan's ...

they're hit hard,
and they're hit fast.

Can't you load him up
with thorazine or doxepin?

Normal psycho tropics don't work.

This thing
is caused by a virus...

that infects the neurological
system in utero.

lt lays dormant...

until it's triggered
by some kind of trauma.

Most likely, he's exhibited
symptoms for some time...

but the infraction,
or the breach...

didn't occur until today.

The triggers can vary.

Uh, usually water-related,
but the results don't vary.

He's notjust catatonic.

He's disappeared--

like having a dream
and never waking up.

For how long?

Oh, forever.

Lee, l think we might be missing
the bigger picture here.

Now, whatever state
that he happens to be in...

there is a girl
that is missing...

and her name is Julia Hickson...

and he is the only one
that knows where she is.

He keeps them in this thing...

for about forty hours.

Now, he took Julia Hickson
at 7:30 last night.

Peter, you know me.

if there were
anything, anything...

What?

He provides them with food...

drinking water, and a toilet.

Now, she thinks
she's been kidnapped...

that there's a chance
of survival...

but it's just a form of torture.

This is a kind of ritual
for him--

a cleansing
before he takes them home...

and turns them into a doll,
a toy.

Now, this thing
is fully automated...

and unless we find her
by tonight...

this will happen to her.

At the request
of Mr. Cooperman...

we've contacted
your board of directors...

and they've given
their approval.

And so have Edward's parents.

But the decision is yours.

It's up to Catherine.

She's the one
who would have to face...

whatever risks there might be...

so, l support
whatever decision she makes.

Can l ask you something?

Please.

If he wasn't like this...

If he was conscious...

do you think that he would
tell you where she is?

There's always a chance
of a confession. Yeah.

And there's things he's done
that show a need for disclosure.

He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.

He wants someone to listen,
to try and understand him.

Look,
I feel for this girl, I do...

but Stargher
may no longer know the truth.

For severe schizophrenics...

there's no discerning
between fantasy and reality.

Is it possible?

If he came to trust me, yes...

but it takes months to earn
that kind of trust.

Is it possible?

Daddy?

Come here...

and save me! Save me!

I'm daddy's girl.

His levels are too flat.

What happened here?

We removed fourteen steel rings.

Should have left him
the way he was.

He used to suspend him self, didn't he?

They're comforted by
the feeling of weightlessness...

like floating in water.

Now, this, gentlemen,
is the catalyst.

The neurological connectic
transfer system...

not only maps the mind...

it sends the signal
to another party.

All you need to do is tune in...

but you do much more
than tune in.

You become part of the show.

He's ready.

Why are there three stations?

For a while, we tried
joint the rapy sessions--

two shrinks
for the price of one--

but Edward hated it
and only talked to Catherine.

She has a gift.

Are you sure?

I'm sure.

OK.

Response signal...

functioning.

We implanted a touch-sensitive
microchip in her hand...

so if she wants
to stop the session...

or if it gets too intense,
she can give the signal...

and we abort.

When we were ready
for practical testing...

Miriam and l auditioned...

some of the best child
therapists in the country.

And all they did was observe
and report, nothing more.

Catherine
was the least experienced...

but she came
so highly recommended...

that we decided, what the hell,
we'll give her a shot...

and immediately,
we could tell she was different.

You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.

You're an animal!

Hey, you.

Yeah, you like that, don't you?

Is your name Carl?

You know, l know another
little boy with a horse.

His name's Edward.

l mean the boy, not the horse.

What's wrong?

His victims.

Where you come from?

Gentlemen, she's back.

I'll be right there.

All right. Come on, Catherine.

She's had quite a journey.

Unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

-So she's made contact?
-Oh, yes.

She's gone very deep
into his world.

At times too far.

It's cold.

That can be dangerous.

What are you talking about?

Well, if she came to believe
that Stargher's world is real...

then theoretically, her mind
could convince her body...

that anything
that was done to it there...

is actually done.

It's like the old wives' tale
where you die in your dream...

you die in real life.

Henry, could you raise
the temperature in here, please?

-Dr. Kent?
-Just a moment, please.

Dr. Kent, can l come in there
and speak with you?

We have to be patient.

l mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.

Let her wake up.

We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?

Our father,
who art in heaven...

hallowed be thy name.
