<i>(1 st man) Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?</i>

<i>(2nd man) Never heard of her.</i>

<i>(3rd man) The patronymic's Borisovna.
Katya Borisovna Orlova.</i>

<i>- Have a think, Barley.
Don't know a Katya.</i>

<i>Never screwed one,
never flirted with one,</i>

<i>never proposed to one,
never even married one.</i>

<i>What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?</i>

<i>(1 st man) She visited the British Council's
audio fair in Moscow exactly a week ago.</i>

<i>(4th man) Audio fair?</i>

<i>(Barley) Cassettes.
Books of the bloody future.</i>

<i>- (4th man) So why didn't you go?
(Barley) l can go. l can not go.</i>

<i>l'm my own man. But you wouldn't
know anything about that.</i>

<i>(American man) Crap, Barley. You rented
a stand, booked your hotel, your flight...</i>

<i>Why didn't you show up?</i>

<i>(Barley) l have a board.
l have family shareholders.</i>

<i>The firm's having withdrawal pains at the
bank, if it's any of your bloody business.</i>

<i>(4th man) lt is.</i>

<i>Tell me something.
Do you know Niki Landau?</i>

Excuse me. Do you know
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

<i>Yeah, l know Niki. Short-arse Polish
cockney sales rep. Goes at it like a rabbit.</i>

Barley? Sure, l know Barley.

House of Abercrombie and Blair,
publishers, drunk or sober.

A gent. One of the best.

l must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
lt is very urgent.

He's not here, darling.

But he was not here yesterday.

Mr Scott Blair never came. He's absent.
AWOL. Not among those present. Sorry.

<i>(Barley) lrritating little sod.
l'm quite fond of him really.</i>

l have an important manuscript for him.
lt is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.

Listen, l'm trying to make a living here.
And not for Mr Blair, love him as l may.

<i>(3rd man) Might one inquire
why she should ask Niki about you?</i>

<i>(Barley) l don't know. l don't know her.</i>

<i>(4th man) So you know Niki,
but not Katya?</i>

Oh, now you're getting it, old boy.

ls that Scotch over there?
Help yourself.

Hold everything.

OK.

You must be very kind and help me.

A Russian friend of mine
has written an important novel.

lts message is important
for all of mankind.

Nice.

ln spite of glasnost, my friend's
novel cannot yet be published...

in the Soviet Union.

Mr Scott Blair has undertaken
to publish it... with discretion.

Don't worry. With Abercrombie and Blair,

your friend's book is virtually guaranteed
to appear in total secrecy.

lf you love peace, please,
take this to England to Mr Scott Blair.

lt is a gift of trust.
lt is better that you smile.

Excuse me?
Smile.

This is Anglo-Soviet cultural exchange.
We smile, we exchange culture.

Looking scared is something different.
Got it in there, have we?

This is dangerous for you.
You must believe in what you are doing.

Smile.

We smile, we kiss. Formal Russian kiss.

That's right.

Now we've done it. You have brought me
an official farewell gift from...

October Publishing
on the last day of the fair.

<i>And l have given you Shakespeare's
Sonnets for Careful Drivers.</i>

Would you... like
a nice dinner out somewhere?

lt is not convenient.

Thank you.

<i>(1 st man) You can't think of any reason
why a book editor called Katya Orlova</i>

<i>should risk her neck
to send you a manuscript?</i>

Barley?

Who said... ''risk her neck''?

l did.

Must be quite a book.
lt is.

May l see it?
Let's begin with the letter.

<i>(groans)</i>

<i>''Personal. For Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Urgent. ''</i>

We'd like to find out why a woman
you don't know should send you a letter

beginning ''My beloved Barley'',
and sign herself ''Your loving K''.

She's potty. Certifiable.

Where is this manuscript?

<i>- That's none of your business.
Like hell it isn't.</i>

<i>She sent it to me as a publisher.</i>

lt's a bloody sight more mine than yours.
Please calm down.

lt's in safe hands, Barley.

The manuscript was in three notebooks.

<i>When Niki couldn't find you in London,
he had the sense to bring them to us.</i>

The first notebook is worthless,
scientifically speaking.

Oh?

Peacenik manifestos, slogans,
poems, quotations.

lt has psychological interest, Minister,
in so far as the writer sounds...

Absolutely barking.

<i>- Would you say?
lt's not a medical term, sir.</i>

Unstable, perhaps.

As for notebooks two and three?
Genuine science.

Written by someone in the business.
No question.

The business?

Destruction paths, payloads, aim points,
bias, rate of burn, trajectories, telemetry.

Of course, it doesn't necessarily
describe the true state of affairs.

<i>What the hell does it purport to describe?</i>

ln a nutshell, the Soviet's strategic
capability for waging nuclear war.

And addressed to boozy Barley Blair.

Well, if it's strategic, we can't
evaluate it without the Americans.

So it's their baby, not ours.

Throw Scott Blair to the Americans.
Unfortunately, we haven't found him yet.

Eureka! We've got him.

A Lisbon bank account, my dears!

We've got him.
Lisbon.

<i>- Why did you run away?
(Barley) Run away? l own a flat here.</i>

<i>(American accent) Why Lisbon, Barley?</i>

<i>(mimics accent) Why Langley, Bob?</i>

You brought a woman?

What's it to you if l brought a woman,
a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?

What do you do with yourself
in Lisbon, Barley?

Well, l was having a drink.

<i>Until l was interrupted.</i>

<i>(Barley chuckling)</i>

Mr Blair?
Eh?

l believe l'm addressing Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Yes? Correct?

Yes.
l'm Merrydew. l'm from the embassy.

We received a rather urgent
message for you over our link.

Are you trying to tell me
someone's dead, old boy?

No. That would be consular.
l'm commercial.

Well, l never knew an honest debt
that couldn't wait till Monday.

Loosen your girdle, Merrydew.
Have a drink with the unwashed.

l say, Blair, the man's the Queen's
emissary, for Christ's sake.

Have they moved the embassy, or are you
hijacking me? What's going on, tubby?

l'm commercial. Strictly commercial.
Mr Blair, sir?

My name's Ned.

l'm about to move the goal posts.

There's no urgent message. There's no
crisis in your affairs - beyond the usual.

l'm from British lntelligence.

Come and meet the others.

This is Clive. This is Walter.

<i>Over here is Bob, who is almost family.
Meet Barley, everyone.</i>

Hello, Barley!
Proud to know you, Barley.

l'm the odd man out here. l work
for the Central lntelligence Agency,

which, as you probably know, is based
in Langley in the state of Virginia.

Let's have some fun. Let's do some good.

Now isn't that jolly?

So, where are we all off to?
Nicaragua? Chile? lran?

Or are we just assassinating
some local nuisance?

Don't rant. Sit down.

Perhaps you can tell us
what this letter's all about.

Recognise the handwriting?
Read it slowly.

Take all the time in the world, Barley.

She's barmy.

<i>(Barley) Who is she?</i>

Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?

Never heard of her.
The patronymic's Borisovna.

Katya Borisovna Orlova.
Have a think, Barley.

l don't know a Katya. Never screwed one,

<i>never flirted with one, never proposed
to one, never even married one.</i>

<i>What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?</i>

<i>So, she wrote you a letter
signed ''Your loving K'',</i>

and you tell me you don't know her?
l told you. l never met the hag.

She's off her tree.

She wasn't even there.

Where?
At Peredelkino.

<i>lt's a Soviet writers' village.</i>

<i>They value their writers. The ones
who behave get their own dachas.</i>

l was lucky enough to be a guest.

When was this?

Three or four months ago.
One of my trips.

But there wasn't any Katya.

<i>- What happened?
l was brilliant.</i>

<i>- Yes?
Oh, yes.</i>

<i>How to save the world between
lunch and dinner. l was flying.</i>

<i>l believe in the new Russia.
You may not, but l do.</i>

20 years ago, it was just a pipe dream.
Today, it's our only hope.

We thought we could bankrupt you
by raising the stakes in the arms race.

Gambling with the fate of the human race.

Barley, you won your gamble.
Nuclear peace for 40 years.

Oh, rubbish. What peace?

Ask the Czechs, the Vietnamese,
the Koreans. Ask the Afghans.

No. lf there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.

We have to save each other,
because all victims are equal.

And none is more equal than others.

lt's everyone's duty to start the avalanche.

A heroic thought, Barley.

Listen, nowadays you have
to think like a hero

just to behave like
a merely decent human being.

And did you believe this nonsense?

l don't know. l believe it when l say it.

But you've got to be there.

You're taking a leak
in some filthy public urinal,

and the man in the next stall leans across
and asks you about God, or Kafka,

or freedom versus responsibility.

So you tell him. Because you know.
Because you're from the West.

And before you've finished shaking your
dick, you think ''What a great country.''

That's why l love them.

And they're very fond of me.

Anyway,... later we talked about jazz,
and l played some.

What, somebody had a saxophone?

What else? Drum kit? Rhythm section?

<i>(* saxophone effect
through a comb and paper)</i>

<i>(* improvised jazz continues)</i>

How many women were there?

Three or four. But no Katya.

<i>But there was someone, wasn't there?</i>

Yes. There was someone.

Someone who is the reason
why we're all here. Yes?

A man or a woman?
Name?

Christ. The way you people
come alive when you smell blood.

<i>(amplified swish)</i>

<i>(amplified crashing)</i>

<i>(amplified)</i>

They called him... Dante.

<i>As in ''lnferno''.</i>

<i>The others said he was on holiday.
A drinking holiday.</i>

He worked some place
where drinking wasn't on.

<i>Everyone deferred to him.</i>

<i>He never spoke.
He just got drunk and stared.</i>

Stared?
Mm. At me.

<i>Did Dante arrive on his own
or with others?</i>

l don't know.

Keep going.

Then l decided to give them all
a rest from wonderful me,

let them talk Russian for a while.

There's a graveyard
a couple of hundred yards up the hill.

<i>lt's a place of pilgrimage.</i>

<i>(speaks Russian)</i>

''lf there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.''

Ah, Dante, old chum.

Come to pay your respects
to old Boris, have you?

Boris Pasternak.

Do you think he knows
people are allowed to read him again?

''All victims are equal.
None is more equal than others.''

<i>Yes, well,... some write better than others.</i>

''How sweet it is to hate one's native land,
to desire its ruin,

and in its ruin to discern
the dawn of universal rebirth.''

Pasternak?
No. Pecherin. An earlier poet.

Pecherin understood that it's possible to
love your country while hating its system.

lf you say so.

l love my country.

<i>l love it too - your country.</i>

And l'm reasonably fond of my own.

To save it, perhaps
it's necessary to betray it. Yes?

Because you and l, we love truth.

Who are you, Dante?

What do you do for a living?

l am a moral outcast.

Oh, it's always nice to meet a writer.

And what sort of rubbish
are you turning out now?

Lies.

l am the lie.

Really?

You spoke the truth.

Promise me that you are not a spy, and
then l will make you a promise in return.

l'm not a spy, actually. Not my line.

You are nobody's spy? Not even ours?

Dante, l'm getting a bit jumpy,
to be honest.

l'm nobody's spy.

Let's talk about something else.
How about chess?

Oh, chess. ln chess there are no lies.
But in my game lies are everything.

What game is that?

The Soviet knight is dying
inside his armour.

You are in danger only from our lies.

l commit the lie every day.
l lie even to my masters.

So, promise me that if l ever find
the courage to think like a hero,

then you will act like
a merely decent human being. Right?

Dante, leave me out, will you?
Hey, you cannot reject me.

Because l am strengthened
by your rejection.

So, promise me.

What the hell am l promising,
for God's sake?

Promise.

All right.

lf you ever manage to be a hero,

l'll be a... decent human being.

OK?

Promise?

l promise.

Why didn't you come to us?! l know why.
You put your head in the sand.

<i>Don't know because don't want to know.</i>

l'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

<i>Then l asked him ''What am l supposed
to be promising, for God's sake?''</i>

<i>Why didn't you come to us?! l know why.
You put your head in the sand.</i>

<i>Don't know because don't want to know.</i>

Who the hell is that?
Walter? He's a character.

<i>l'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.</i>

That's it.
And the notebooks?

The notebooks don't mesh
with any disinformation artist,

con man or intelligence peddler we know.

Our psychology and handwriting gurus
tried to fault them.

And?
They failed.

Try harder, Russell.

No.

No.

No.

Not even a perhaps or a maybe?

No. Not even a tickle, old boy.
They're not in Dante's class.

All right.

ls that Katya?

That's her.
You remember her now?

No such luck.

Choose someone else.

We didn't choose you. Dante did.

Because l wasn't a spy.

We're not asking you to build
the beastly rockets or push the button.

Only to help improve
our knowledge of the enemy.

And if the enemy turns out to be a friend,
where's the harm?

l thought we were all supposed
to be chums together now.

Oh, my dear Lord!

Because this year it suits them
to roll over and play nice doggie?

Because this year they're
on the floor anyway? You ninny.

All the more reason to spy
the daylights out of 'em.

Kick 'em in the balls
every time they get to their knees.

Well, that's where l disagree.

l'll back my Russia against yours
any time.

Nah.

l'm sorry, Ned. No go.

Bloody woman. l must've given offence.

She has a point.

Worry about Dante.

He reached out for you.

Would you rather
throw him to the Americans?

Don't be fooled by Bob's Yaley manner.

The Yanks will take Dante,
put him on a spit and have a barbecue.

How will you live with yourself?

<i>l don't live with myself.</i>

ln fact, l try to give myself a wide berth.

l'm offering you a fresh start.
And a fat cheque.

Never mind the money.
Barley's far too grand.

This is something people write in for.

The chance to be an active player
in the defence of their country.

You live in a free society.
You've no choice.

Any decent church would've
burnt you bastards years ago.

You're a fool to use me.

l let people down.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

<i>Abercrombie and Blair.</i>

ls it the office of...
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

<i>Yes. But he isn't in at the moment.</i>

<i>Can l help, or would you
like to leave a message?</i>

No, thank you. lt is a publishing matter.

l will telephone again. Thank you.

<i>(Ned) Crowds are good,
if you keep moving.</i>

<i>Open spaces are good.</i>

<i>Talking in the street is OK, if you have to.</i>

<i>Never, never talk in a car
or in your hotel room,</i>

<i>except for the benefit
of their microphones.</i>

<i>lf you've read anything about playing
the radio or running the taps, forget it.</i>

That's right. The source
is the star of the show.

And the star decides
whether to make the meeting or abort.

This is fun. ls that why you keep it secret?

Did you spot our watchers?

The tramp raiding the dustbin,
the woman with the white shoes,

and, of course, the man with the tracksuit.

You scored nil. Out of a possible 1 2.

The lesson is
you'll never know who they are.

lf you need to write something down, use
a single sheet of paper on a hard surface.

That leaves no impression.

How many such surfaces
can you see in this room?

Well, including the windowsill... four.

Seven.

This is often easiest.

Then wipe it clean - rubbing hard.

<i>The issue is why.</i>

That's what you're looking for all the time.

lf we trust the motive, we trust the man.

Then we can trust the material.

Why did Dante pick on Katya?

Why does he put her life at risk?

Why does she let him?

<i>ls she a spy?</i>

lt's voice-activated, sir. You switch...
l know all this. l've had it up to here.

l just want to get it done.
What's the hold-up?

lt's everything we ever wanted to know
about Russia and were afraid to ask.

Sounds like the pot of gold.
Sounds like a crock of shit.

Some unidentified walk-in is telling us
the Russians are way behind,

they can't hurt us,
we can pull in our horns.

Who the hell is gonna
sell that story on the Hill?

Russell?

lt could turn around
and bite us right in the ass.

Let the Brits run with it for a while.

Dante is their source,
and, uh... Scott Blair is their problem.

l'll go with that, Russell. But l want
Joe and Larry with him in London.

Friendly observers, OK?

You'll do us proud, Barley.

l've brought you a present.

lt's not to keep. lt's just to sniff.

Am l supposed to offer to publish it?
Offer him anything he wants.

Say anything you need to say
to keep him with us.

Except the truth?

Bon voyage, Barley.

<i>Come back with the goods on Dante,
starting with his real name,</i>

<i>and l'll get you a knighthood for literature.</i>

The Russia House.

Barley Scott Blair.
Abercrombie and Blair?

<i>London. The publishers.</i>

l believe you know Niki Landau.

<i>Yes.</i>

Well, Niki was very insistent that l should
give you a call. How do you do?

<i>How do you do?</i>

l'll tell you why l'm calling.
l'm here in Moscow.

And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea.
Well, a couple of pounds.

l hope you like tea.

l was wondering
if we could arrange a handover.

<i>- A handover?
Do you ever escape for lunch?</i>

Yes. Of course.

<i>Well, how about today?
l'm at the Ukraine Hotel.</i>

<i>- That would be convenient.
Good. Marvellous.</i>

Well, l'll be outside from 1 2.30 on.

<i>- How will l know you?
Oh, listen, l'm easy to recognise.</i>

l look like a large, unmade bed
with a shopping bag attached.

We're off.

Hi. Hello.

You're Katya, of course.

Yes. And you must be Mr Barley.

Yes, indeed. The same. Well done.

Well, er... where shall we go?

l brought your stuff from Niki,
but l'll carry it.

How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?

<i>Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer
to the Venus de Milo.</i>

That is ridiculous.

l was nearly arrested here
three years ago.

They said l was photographing
a military subject.

And were you?
No. A soldier and his girlfriend.

They asked me to take their picture.

Obviously l received the manuscript.

l will take you to where
we can have lunch.

lf you do not mind, l will first buy shoes.

Shoes?

Today there is a shipment of shoes.

With perestroika, there is
even less available than before.

Really? l thought things were improving.
Everything is corrupt and incompetent.

Perhaps different people
are now stealing. l don't know.

Keep your voice down.

Complaining is our new human right.

Glasnost gives everyone
the right to complain and accuse,

but it doesn't make more shoes.

Tell me about your new Russian book.

Oh, yes. The book.

Well, my problem is that, er,
l don't know the author's real name,

let alone where he gets
all his information from.

Learned his craft and so forth. Hm?

Such personal questions
are not appropriate.

Some writers can only work in obscurity.

But you know publishing, hm?

lf a fella's written about
the hill tribes of northern Burma,

well, you're entitled to know if he's
ever been further south than Minsk.

Especially if it's a really important book.
Which this one is.

Dynamite, in fact.

The author was inspired by certain
opinions of a British publisher

concerning world peace.

Do you think he'd like
to meet that publisher again?

lt is not known. This can be established.

<i>The publisher would like
to meet him again.</i>

How long are you staying in Moscow,
please, Mr Barley?

Seven days,... Mrs Katya.

<i>(* plays mournful tune)</i>

Where do you live?
With my children.

Your children? How many?

l have a boy and a girl.
They are eight and nine years old.

lt is not relevant.

What does your husband do?

lt is not important.

ls he a publisher too?
No.

ls he a writer?

No.

A composer? A cook?

ls he a dressmaker in Vladivostok?

His factory prefabricates houses
for rural areas.

We are divorced.
Like everybody else in Moscow.

<i>(* mournful tune continues)</i>

Unfortunately, l have
to return to my children now.

lsn't someone looking after them?

Well, ring up. Tell them
you've met a fascinating man

that wants to talk literature
to you all day.

l'm sorry. l cannot.

Oh, look, we've hardly met.

l need time.

l've got 10,000 enormously
serious things to discuss

with a beautiful Russian woman.

l don't bite, l don't lie...
Have dinner with me.

At least show me something of Moscow.
lt is not convenient.

Then give me your home number.
lt is not convenient.

Will you call me, then?
Perhaps.

When?

Perhaps l shall call you late tonight.

No, not ''perhaps''.

l shall call you.

You forgot to give her the tea.

Mr Blair, sir?
Wicklow.

Excellent morning's work, sir.
No problems.

Oh, by the way, you asked why so many
Russians use the word ''convenient''.

ln Russian it's ''udobno''.
But it also means ''proper''.

A bit confusing really.
Yes, it is indeed.

We have an interim, sir.

Katya left her office, took a taxi,
unknown destination. We have it covered.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

<i>Da?</i>

<i>Da, eta Alina.</i>

<i>- Dobry dyen.
Barley!</i>

Welcome to Moscow, my dear chap!
Alik.

Why do you look so healthy? Why
have you no hangover? Are you in love?

How did you know, Alik?

Meet Leonard Carl Wicklow,
our new editor of Soviet books.

Alik Zapadny of VAAP,

the all-suffocating
Soviet Copyright Agency.

How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
Oh, Russia's top of the pops these days.

Mention to the money boys
that we want to build up a Russian list

and they throw money at us.

Have you a sales force, or are you
still relying on divine intervention?

And how about translators?

On fiction we will use our own
and take another 5% royalty. How's that?

We'll consider it.
No, l don't think so.

We don't have the margin.

Exactly.

Well done, Wickers.

Jesus, Barley!
Yuri.

What are you doing here?
You're a month early for the book fair.

Yuri, l want you to meet Len Wicklow,
our new Russian-speaking specialist.

Hello. You a spy?

Only in my spare time, sir.
Jesus, l like him.

Oh, thank you. Sit down, friend.

Let's deal direct, OK?

To hell with those assholes at VAAP.

Stay away from them.
Especially Zapadny.

l don't say he's KGB.

All l say is he needed some damned good
friends to get him back into circulation.

Know what l mean?

<i>- Cheers.
Na zdorovye.</i>

Oh, Barley... l have something for you.

Some of these writers haven't yet
been to jail. But l'm working on it.

l'll make them famous in the West
even if it kills them.

<i>(phone rings)</i>

lt's me.

Do l disturb you?

Deeply. Come over.

You invited me to show you Moscow
tomorrow, l think.

l did. Where do l send the glass coach?

l have the tapes, and l've never heard
such pussyfooting around in my life!

Barley has gotta tell Katya:
no more Greta fucking Garbo.

And Dante better shit or get off the pot.

<i>l'm being pelted with crap
in the streets here!</i>

All right, Russell, message understood.

Brock?

Russell's metaphors are becoming
rather scatological.

Signal Paddy at the embassy.
l want him to talk to Barley.

Er, we're this way.

l hope you like churches.

ln Russia we don't ask that.
lt is not convenient.

Ah. l think you mean ''proper''. No?

Proper?
Mm.

<i>Nyet. Convenient.</i>

Now you know why hardly anyone
comes up here. Mind your head.

One more to go. This way.

This is just like school.

Dear old, bloody old... school.

Who is that man down there?

Oh, he's my editor. He's keeping lookout.

Are we ready? Thank you, Brock.

Why is an editor keeping a lookout?

Well...

Do you drink this stuff?

No.

Me neither.

What's Dante's real name, huh?

Who is he?

Does he test things?

ls he a physicist?
An engineer? ls he army?

Does he like ice cream?

Does he like the movies?

<i>ls he one man? ls he two? ls he a group?</i>

Why don't you just start talking
and let's see how it goes?

Come on, Katya. You started this, l didn't.

Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
l do jokes, l do bird noises, l drink.

l'm a friend.

Who is he?
l don't know what l may tell you.

What did he tell you to tell me?

Whatever is necessary.
That l should trust you.

He was generous. lt is his nature.

Why did you send me the book
if you didn't trust me?

lt was for him that l sent it.
l did not select you, he did.

Oh.

He is... my friend.

ls this what you usually do for friends?

Smuggle their manuscripts
out to the West?

Risk your life, your children?

Does he understand the consequences?
Does he care?

He is reconciled.

Are you?
Of course.

And your children?

lt is for them and their generation.

He is inspired by the new openness here.

But he knows that nothing
will change by itself.

And you agree?
Yes! And so do you!

You spoke for him.
lt is for you we are here!

That's worth a drink.

He is not a soldier.
He is a scientist. He is a physicist.

<i>- Also qualified in aspects of engineering.
Better! Ha-ha!</i>

Engineering.
We're making progress, gentlemen.

Where was he trained?

He went to the LlTMO.

Afterwards to postgraduate studies
at the university.

What's the LlTMO?

Leningrad lnstitute of Mechanical and
Optical Science! Write that down, fellas.

LlTMO is the Leningrad lnstitute
for Mechanical and Optical Science.

He was extremely brilliant.
At 1 4 he won a mathematics olympiad.

Mathematics.

When l was at school,
they were the people l couldn't stand.

Naturally, if you are not so intelligent,
you will be jealous.

<i>(hugely amplified clanging)</i>

<i>(bells ring)</i>

From university he went
to Academgorodok,

the City of Science at Novosibirsk.

He was... like a meteor there.

ls that where you met him?

No!

ln Leningrad. l was a child.
A great intellectual of 16.

l met Yakov at the club...
Yakov?

Yakov is Dante?
Yes. Yakov.

First name Yakov!
Jacky.

We met at the Club of Scientists.

lt was at a closed showing
of a foreign film.

<i>lt was by Godard.
À bout de souffle. Breathless.</i>

l went with my father.

And what year are we talking about now?

1 968.

You remember '68?

The Paris students at the barricades,
American students against Vietnam,

and for us it was Czechoslovakia.

Yakov said that the Russians
would never stop

the extraordinary reforms
happening there.

lt was the start of a new age.

He had come back to Leningrad
to be a part of it.

From where?
From the military.

They had seduced him with privileges,
money for his researches...

They had corrupted him.

He had come back to Leningrad
to recover his innocence.

He was beautiful.

Not like a scientist, like an...

artist.

So you fell in love with him.

He was my first lover.

lt was the same night
that the tanks entered Prague.

There was no more innocence anywhere.

Yakov said that innocence
was a delusion.

And a few weeks later
he returned to the military.

l did not talk to him for many years.

Until last year, when he met a British
publisher who spoke to his heart.

Next day, Yakov telephoned me
at the office.

He had decided what he must do.
He needed my help.

<i>ls he alone in this?
Does he need anyone else's help?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>- None of his drinking friends?
No.</i>

How can you be so certain?

Because l am certain that
in his thoughts he is completely alone.

Are you happy with him?

Please?
l mean, er... do you like him?

As well as loving him.
Does he make you laugh? Hm?

l believe that Yakov
is a great and important man,

who is trying to restore himself
and cannot survive without me.

Oh.

Jesus Christ, Mother of God! lt's Savelyev!

Yakov Yefremovich Savelyev!

Did he mention anything about, er...
falsification of results?

He talks about ''the great lie''.
Everything is part of the great lie.

Ah. Go on.

Are you part of the great lie also, Barley?

What?

l think l am also allowed to ask questions.

Oh, of course. Ask.

Are you Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

Aw, for God's sake...
Are you?

Yes.
Are you a publisher?

Yes.

Are you a spy?

No.

Are you alone in this,
or were you sent by others?

Answer her.

l'm alone.

Jesus! Fuck.

l'm alone, and that's the God's truth.

Never been more alone.

Yakov said he will meet you in Leningrad
in four days from now.

He has proposed three places
and three times.

He will keep one of the appointments,
if he can.

Good.

<i>(cork pops)</i>

Reconstruction. Openness.

He's going to reconstruct
the balance of terror,

and open the ultimate can of worms.

Savelyev?! My God, if Dante is Savelyev,
you guys don't know what you've got!

<i>- Yes, we do. Trouble.
(phone rings)</i>

Yakov Savelyev is
the right hand of God over there.

<i>(scientist) And he says it's shit?
The Soviet threat's one big lie?</i>

<i>And look at this.</i>

They're bullshitting the Kremlin.
Honour is due, Ned.

<i>Russell, l need your money.
And your love.</i>

l want an American partner for Barley.
l want him in Leningrad on Friday.

l hear you, Ned. l'll get right back to you.

lf he says they can't hit Nevada on a clear
day, you better believe it. And be joyful.

Joyful? Most of our customers
come to this town with contracts

to bring peace and prosperity to
the arms industry for the next 50 years.

But how the fuck
do you peddle an arms race

when the only asshole you've got
to race against is yourself?

<i>(phone rings)</i>

The night train to Leningrad.

l may have mentioned Mr Potomac Books,
my new American partner?

Well, he's doing Leningrad,
and he summoned me for a powwow.

<i>- Powwow?
l thought you knew English.</i>

''Powwow'' is not English.

<i>- You must sit down.
Sit down? Why?</i>

lt is our custom before a long journey
first to sit down.

Well, l'm lying down. Won't that do?

Well,... you are supposed
to sit on your luggage

and sigh a little and cross yourself.

Hold everything.

OK.

<i>(sighs)</i>

l was more comfortable lying down.

Are you coming back to Moscow?

<i>No, not this time.
l have to fly straight back to school.</i>

School?

<i>Work. England.
lt's a stupid expression of mine.</i>

l hope l didn't bore you last night.

<i>You did not bore me.</i>

Oh. Perhaps next time.

l'll make a special journey
just to talk about myself.

l wish you a good journey, Barley.

l'll miss you.

l want you to know something, Scott.
This little country is on the move.

l smell hope here.

l smell change. l smell commerce.

And we are buying ourselves a piece of it.
l'm proud. Proud.

0800 hours. Barley and Wicklow
are in Leningrad.

Checked in at the Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.

<i>Good. We're on schedule.</i>

<i>Barley's got three chances
to make contact.</i>

<i>Now it's up to Dante.</i>

You want to sell me something?

Cigarettes, Scotch, drugs, currency?

No, thanks. Cheerio.

You get lost?

<i>That's a good idea. Why don't you try it?</i>

One down, two to go.

Where are you, Dante?

Sir. Excuse me, sir,
but l think we are acquainted.

Good God! The great Dante,
as l live and breathe!

We met at that writer's party
at Peredelkino, remember?

The only two sober people there.

How are you?
l'm very well.

Welcome to Leningrad.

You can walk a little?
lt is safest to keep moving.

Yes, they told me that.

Barley's made contact! He's done it.

Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.

So he gave it to our authorities.
People of... discretion. Experts.

You have betrayed me.

Nobody's betrayed you.

l told you. Your manuscript
went astray, that's all.

<i>Our authorities admire your book.</i>

But they need to know if it's true.

The best way would be
for you to talk with them.

You came to tell me
you refuse to publish me?

Dante, you're going too fast.

Russia has no time.

When the ice is thin,
you have to walk fast.

To lose time is to lose everything.

And then we all slide into the grave.
So be it. l will be the first corpse.

And Katya second. What about her?

She also chose.

lf we act together,
we will survive together.

Have you forgotten
your words at Peredelkino?

l am not the man you thought l was.

You do not need to remind me that
man is not equal to his rhetoric.

Our new people talk about openness.

Disarmament. Peace.

Words.

You like graveyards, Barley?

Look. Here is ours if we fail.

Chose a monument.
