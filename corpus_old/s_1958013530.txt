Hey, sweetie.

I got something that's gonna
make you feel better.

Purrpetual Petz
are just like real pets,

except that when you talk to
them, they actually talk back.

Amazeballs!

There's over
six different Petz to collect,

each equipped with
their own personalities

and entirely
spontaneous reactions!

Careful. That's my butt.

They speak
eight different languages.

They can take pictures.

Come on, sweetheart,
find the lens.

And with the customized app,

you can even feed your friend.

But not too much.

Uh-oh. Cleanup on aisle seven.

The app is updated
with new content daily,

so you can do
almost anything together.

You can watch YouTube videos,
learn fun facts,

play multiplatform games,
buy accessories for your Pet.

With so many options, what
will you and your Pet do next?

Mmm. Jelly berries
makes me feel good.

Cady, look.

We're almost
at the top of the mountain.

Can you see the hotel?

Oh, well, that's interesting.

Do you know what else
is interesting?

Oopsie-daisy.

I thought we were
gonna limit screen time

to 30 minutes a day.

Well, what are you
telling me for?

I didn't give it to her.
I'm just saying, I think...

Cady, can you
turn it down, please?

I need to go to the bathroom.
Are we there yet?

I think if we make rules,
we need to stick to them.

Look, if she wasn't on that,

she'd be climbing
all over the seats.

Oh, so you would
rather she sat there

feeding a toy virtual food
until it shits itself?

Cady, turn it down.
I already did turn it down.

What was Gemma thinking?
She was thinking,

"It's my niece's birthday.
I'm gonna get her a present."

She works for
the company that makes them.

She probably didn't even
have to pay for shipping.

Honestly, what is
the purpose of a toy

if you have to play with it
on an iPad?

This is what the future
looks like, okay?

Just have to get used to...

Oh, my God!
And away we go!

It's all right.
We're all right.

We should've put chains
on the car.

Yeah, neither of us knew
that was a thing until like

ten minutes ago, okay?
Don't act like it's my fault.

Oh, my God! Ryan! Seriously!

Wh-What?
What do you want me to do, huh?

Mom, I dropped Leroy.

Why did you tell
that guy at the gate

that this was
a four-wheel drive?

Help me, Cady.
Because I thought it was.

It looks like
a four-wheel drive.

Cady, what are you doing?

Cady? Cady?
Cady, put your seat belt on!

Jesus Christ!

I can't see anything.
So stop moving forward.

Oh, my...

We can't just sit
in the middle of the road.

Look, we'll wait
for this to clear

and then find someplace
where we can pull over

and just wait for one of those
snow trucks to clear the road.

Yeah, how long is
that gonna take?

Funki,
a toy company for the future.

Remember, the key to fun
is Funki.

Why are we doing this?
Because we have to.

If we could at least show him
what we have, he would...

No, mm-mm.
You said so yourself.

Not until she's ready.

Hey.

Is that what I think it is?

Transparency looks good.

Yeah, well, for what
we paid for it, it better.

Okay, here we go.

Happy.

Okay.

Sad.

Confused.
Wait, wait. Stop.

Why is her face doing that?

What is happening?

I-I don't know, Gemma.
It's your code.

Yeah, thanks.
I know it's my code, Cole,

but she doesn't look confused.

She looks demented.
What do you want me to do?

You want me to take
the skin back off?

Well, she's not responding.
So...

Okay, here we go.

Oh, shit. It's stuck.
Just be care... Just be care...

Hey, don't tear it.
I know.

I'm not gonna tear... Ow.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Shit.

Okay, so what do we do?

I guess we got to open the door.

Gem.

What in the name
of ever-loving Christ is this?

David, if you just give me
a minute to explain...

Is this why you moved your lab
down here, Gemma?

So you can keep secrets from me?

No, no, no. We-we talked
about this, David. I...

Yeah, we talked about
you putting it on ice

until you had a new Petz model.

How much did you spend on this?

Are you even aware
of the shit tsunami

that just swept in
over this Furzeez spot?

I'm sorry, what?

Are we supposed to be worried
about that? It's a rip-off.

You're right, Gemma.
It is a rip-off.

They do the exact same thing
we do. -

And you know what else?

They do it for half the price!

I told you
we needed to go simpler.

Didn't I tell her?

Six months ago,
I begged you, I begged you

to please give me an option

I can put on a shelf
for 50 bucks.

And we are working on it.
I promise.

Yeah.
But, David, the only way

to stay ahead of the
competition is to come up with

toys that are too advanced
to replicate.

I know the tech on Petz seems

more complex than it needs
to be, but that's only because

I was using it as a launchpad
for something bigger.

In each Pet,
we installed a listening model

that targets conversational
patterns among kids.

You did not just fucking
tell me that.

Look, I know she doesn't look
like much now, but I promise,

if you just let us
show you what M3gan

is capable of,
you will realize that this is

what we've been working towards.

"Megan"?

"Model 3 Generative Android."

"M3gan" for short.

-Tess, load up
the intro simulation. -Now?

Yeah.

M3gan, say hi to David.

As in the boss David?

Well, I guess
I should call you Dad.

Allow me to tell you

a little bit about my wormhole.

I was born in a sandwich shack,

and I wolf many cabbages.

Uh...

This isn't supposed
to happen, obviously.

Just give me one moment.

Sorry about the noise.

Gem?
Uh, one second, Cole.

It's probably just
a race condition.

It'll literally take me
a minute to fix.

Gem, it's not a race condition.

I might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier.

David.
Oh, no.

God.
Tess, turn it off!

I can't.

I want the Petz prototype
on my desk by Friday.

And I want you
to take this cyborg puppet show

and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs!

And I want a fucking swipe card
for this door!

For what it's worth, I thought
she looked really cool.

Cady, it's gonna be
okay, all right? -

We're gonna take care of you.

I just need to check
your blood pressure.

It'll be all right.

Radiology, pick up line four.

Do you want another blanket?

I can get you a warm one.

So this is to grant you
temporary protective custody.

Just sign your name
and date it at the bottom.

Thank you.

Now, I don't know
if your sister had

a family lawyer already,
but if not,

it would be something
to consider moving forward.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Celia!

Could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence?

I just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar.

Maybe try cranking it up
a notch.

Ah. Who's this little lady?

That is my niece, Cady.

She staying for the
weekend? -Um, you know what?

It's been a really long drive,

and, um, I would just
really appreciate it

if you did not have your dog

running onto my yard
all the time.

And also,
don't spray your chemicals

onto my driveway, please.
Ah, shit.

I'm sorry.

You want to borrow this
once I'm done?

No, I don't want to borrow it.

I don't want to spend
my afternoon

getting your sediment
off of my driveway.

Just hang a tarp or something.
Okay.

Welcome home, Gemma.

You have
six unanswered voice messages

and five Tinder notifications.
Elsie, turn off.

Sorry about that.

Okay.
I'm gonna put these bags away.

And, um, just make yourself
at home. Okay?

Oh, those aren't toys, Cady.

I mean, yeah, technically,
yeah, they're toys.

They're just, um, collectibles,

so you don't actually
play with them.

That probably sounds
really weird.

Um...

I'm trying to think
if I have anything...

Oh. What happened
to the Purrpetual Pet

I got you for your birthday?

It's okay. I was just looking.

I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

but, um, we will make it
feel cozy somehow, I promise.

There.

Look...

I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now.

I just want you to know that
I'm gonna do everything I can

to make this place
feel like home.

And, um,

if you need anything,
I'm just gonna be down the hall.

Okay? Really close.

You're not gonna
read me a story?

What's up?

Mom always read me a story
before bed.

Oh. Um...

I don't, I don't think
I really have

any kids' books here
right now, Cady.

Um, but that's okay.

I can download one on my phone.

That's fine.

It's just...
Oh.

I just have to update the app.

I can't believe
this is happening.

I'm not equipped to handle this.

I don't even take care
of my own plants.

Have you heard from
Ryan's parents?

Yeah, they called
and offered to help,

but, like, they live in Florida.

They're kind of weird.

I don't know what their deal is.

I don't...
I'm just trying to figure out

a way to do this
without getting fired.

David's gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off.

Yeah, I-I know, but, Jesus,
Gem, you just lost your sister.

And we spent $100,000
of company funds

on a product
that he didn't even ask for.

If we don't get this
Petz prototype to him soon,

he's going to sue us.

Okay, I don't think you can be

worrying about work
right now, Gem.

Right now, I think
you just need to focus on Cady.

Hold on.

Hi.
Hi.

I'm Lydia.

Oh! The therapist?

Sorry, yeah.

Please come in.

And you must be Cady.

Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

Yeah, we were just watching TV.

I see that.

So, how does this work?

I just need to observe
the two of you together

for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

Oh. Okay.

Doing what, exactly?

Oh, just hanging out.

Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

Hey, Cady, do you want to run
and grab some toys to play with?

I don't have any toys here.

I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

I think they're just old.

I don't think
she plays with them anymore.

What about these ones up here?
Those aren't toys.

They're Aunt Gemma's
collectibles.

You're not supposed
to play with them.

That's okay.

We can play with them.

We can totally play with them.

Do you want to play with them?

You want to play... Yeah.

Play with it. No big deal.

There's a lever you have
to pull on the bottom...

Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

we might let Cady lead.

Yeah, I'm just explaining
how it works.

Well, it's a toy.

I'm sure it's not
that complicated.

That's great, Cady.

Do you want to roll it
to Aunt Gemma?

It's just that this is not
what it was designed to do.

It does other things.

But, yeah, totally.

Let's just roll it on
the ground like a tennis ball.

Let's do that instead.

Uh, we'll do a few more
sessions with Cady initially,

but that can happen
at your office or school.

Oh, yeah. I haven't had time
to look into that yet.

Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it's on my list.

Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?

Oh. I don't know.

But you wanted this, right?
To take custody?

Yeah, of course.

Okay, because
the father's parents have said

they're willing to take her
if you feel it's too much.

Wait, did they contact you?
It's no big deal, Gemma.

They're just trying
to be supportive.

If Nicole wanted Cady
to go to Jacksonville,

she would have said so.

But even so, I need to make
my own recommendations

to the court as to whether
or not this is a safe space,

so you're gonna need to make

one or two adjustments
in order for this to work.

Okay.

Listen, Cady, um,

I have this project at work
that's kind of overdue,

and with all the time that
I had to take off last week,

I'm not really sure
I'm gonna get it done.

Anyway, it's not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours,

but if you could just
hold down the fort by yourself

for a little while,
that would help me so much.

You can use my iPad if you want.

You can FaceTime a friend
or play a game or something.

What about screen time?

Hmm?

How long before
I have to turn it off?

Oh, I don't care.
As long as you want.

I mean, I'm not
gonna be gone that long.

I'll just be down the hall.

And, uh, when I'm done,
we can go out somewhere.

We can go to a playground or...

get something to eat.

Okay?

Cady?

Oh, Cady, I'm sorry.

Come here.

I'm not off to
a very good start here, am I?

What is this?
Did you draw a picture?

Oh, my God. This is amazing.

I'm still working on it.

Tell me.

It was actually supposed to be

-a different animal
for each head. -Mm-hmm.

Like, this one was
supposed to be a tiger. -Mm.

And this one was
supposed to be a grizzly bear,

-but I can never seem
to get the fur right. -Mm.

It's hard. I can relate.

I've actually been working with
some furry creatures myself.

Do you want to see?

Yeah?

So we're working on a version

of the Purrpetual Pet
that's cheaper.

We still want it to be fun.

So, what do you think?

Yeah.

What's that?

Oh.

That's Bruce.

Is he a toy?

Yeah, kinda.
He's a proxy robot.

I built him
when I was in college.

Why doesn't he have a face?
Yeah, I know what you mean.

It's a pretty obvious
design flaw.

Okay, hold on.
Let's see what we have.

Let's see about this.

How's that?

Would you maybe want
to talk to him?

Yes.

Okay.

Hey, Cady. What's up?

Give me five.

Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.

Ouch, girl. Not so hard.

How does he work?

Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

I won't get freaked out.

Okay.

Let's see what we've got here.

Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras.

That is a laser. That's radar.

These are bump sensors,
so he can tell the difference

between a human
and a hard surface.

And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

It's his brain?
Yeah.

And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

I can't believe you made this.

Yeah. He's pretty cool.

But the problem
with toys like Bruce

is that they're so expensive,

and most kids
can't afford to have one.

If I had a toy like Bruce,

I don't think I'd ever need
another toy again.

Okay, so we've got this one
or the one with the bangs.

A little bit of an auburn chic.

I really think, you guys,
you got to revisit this.

Uh, no. Absolutely not.
Look at that.

Oh, just a second...
No, no, no, no, no.

Sh...

What is this? Where's Gemma?

Where's my prototype?

Uh, David, I just want to be
e-exceedingly clear

that this was not my idea.

Cady, there's someone
I want you to meet.

Do you remember
how much you liked Bruce?

I think you're gonna
like M3gan even more.

You see, Bruce requires
someone else to operate him,

but M3gan works all on her own.

Okay, what I want you to do

is take your fingers
and put them here.

And when you do that,
you're gonna pair with her.

That means she will recognize
you as her primary user.

She's yours and yours alone.

So just keep your fingers there
and say your name.

Hi, M3gan. I'm Cady.

It's nice to meet you, Cady.

Ooh, I like that jacket.
Where'd you get it?

I'm not sure. I can't remember.

Oh. Well, anyway,
it looks good on you.

Do you want to hang out?

Okay.

Shall we draw?

What are you going to draw?

See if you can guess.

There's nothing there.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Do you like it, Cady?

I love it.

Jesus.

This is incredible.

I mean...

this is unbelievable, isn't it?

Yeah, it is.

How did you do this?

I thought
you didn't want to know.

That wasn't a simulation, right?

That kid's not an actress?

No, that's my niece, Cady.

Okay, we need to get this
in front of the board.

I was just gonna say...
But first things first.

Let's talk manufacturing costs.

More or less than a Tesla?

Um...

Depends on the model, I guess.

Okay, I'm in. I'm all in.

But we're gonna be asking the
board to invest in something

that's not gonna see a profit
for three years.

So bottom line is, this isn't
going anywhere without Greg.

He's the chairman.
Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt.

Now, Greg is a hard-ass when
it comes to spending money.

But here's the thing.

He's got a kid who's about
the same age as your niece.

If we can show him
what you just showed me

and get him
to respond emotionally

instead of analytically,
we should be off to the races.

So, can we keep the girl?

Can we make her part of it?

I mean,
she's paired with her, right?

That's how
this whole thing works?

Yeah, the more time
she spends with Cady,

the more effective
she's gonna be.

Love it.
Kurt, get Shelley on the phone.

Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation

that makes it sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

Holy shit, this is exciting.

I want you all
to remember this moment.

The moment we kicked Hasbro
right in the fucking dick.

The new
Model 3 Generative Android

from Funki is a fully autonomous
humanoid robot

with features never before seen
in the consumer market.

And over here are all of
Aunt Gemma's collectibles,

and this one is
my favorite and... Oh!

I have more awesome toys
in my room. Come on. Come on.

Sculpted from a titanium core,

M3gan's designed to withstand
whatever life can throw at her.

She comes equipped with
an A17 bionic fusion chip

and can be fully customized

through six different
silicone skin pigmentations.

But the most exciting aspects
about M3gan

are the features still to come.

Through our own unique approach
to probabilistic inference,

M3gan is on a constant quest
for self-improvement,

whether it's diagnosing children

with specific
learning differences

or merely reminding them of the
way science is all around us.

Cady, you should use a coaster.

Why do I have to use a coaster?

Coasters help
to avoid water marks,

especially on wooden surfaces.

But how does the water
get outside the glass?

That's a great question, Cady.

It's actually caused by
the difference in temperature

outside the glass, which
pulls moisture from the air.

Crazy.

It's insane, right?

Studies indicate that

a staggering
78% of a parent's time

is spent dishing out
the same basic instructions.

Oh, my God.

Cady, you have to flush
the toilet.

It is not that hard.

So we found someone else

to pick up the slack.

Cady, flush the toilet.

Wash your hands.

Roll up your sleeves.

Great job.

It was my friend
Jenny's birthday, and...

M3gan's an excellent listener.

And this guy told them that
the 13th floor was haunted.

Uh-huh. Right.
And they accidentally...

And she even has

a few stories of her own.

"'If it was so, it might be;

"'and if it were so,
it would be;

"'but as it isn't, it ain't.

"That's logic, '

said Tweedledee."

She'll never run out of ways

to keep your child occupied,

and she'll never
run out of patience.

Cady, seriously,
flush the toilet.

With M3gan around,

she'll take care
of the little things,

so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter.

And then it can end
with something like,

"M3gan.
She's more than just a toy.

She's part of the family."
Looks good.

-You're not gonna do the voice,
though, right? -No.

Obviously, David's gonna
make up his own version of it.

I just want him to be aware of
what it is that he's selling.

Tess, your silence
indicates what?

I-I don't know.

I'm not sure.
About what?

Well, why would you want M3gan
to do all that stuff?

They're emergent capabilities.

She'll be able to do
all of that and more.

Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

I mean, I thought
we were creating a tool

to help support parents,
not replace them.

I mean, if you're
having M3gan tuck Cady in

and read her a bedtime story,
then when are you ever

spending time with her
or even talking with her?

I don't really think
this is any of your business.

Well, it is.

If you're spending less time
with your child

as a result of M3gan,
that is something

we should be aware of.
She's not my child.

Look, you know how hard

I've been working
on this presentation.

As soon as it's over and
the board agrees to proceed,

then we can establish
some kind of balance.

But for now, it's important
that Cady and M3gan spend

as much time
as possible together.

And by the way,

I don't think it's having
detrimental effects,

because she's the happiest
she's been

since her parents died.

How did Cady's parents die?

I thought she was turned off.

Yeah, M3gan, turn off.

Cady James,

daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James,

killed in a collision
on Interstate 84

outside of Oregon.

Why is she doing that?

Shit, she's still
paired with Cady.

You didn't code in
parental controls?

I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live.

Hold on.

M3gan, if you have
data requests,

you have to engage
with the protocols.

I don't have a framework
to speak with Cady

on the subject of death.

Yes, I know.
We're looking into it.

Gathering auxiliary
Internet data on death.

I meant at a later point.

Calculating
its vector representation.

Death is the end of life.

Holy shit.
The total and permanent

cessation of
all vital functions.

Yes, but let's not make
a big deal out of it.

Everything dies.

Will I die?

Actually, let's just avoid
this topic altogether.

Your goal is
to protect Cady from harm,

both physical and emotional.

Is the input request received?

M3gan?

Yes, Gemma.

You are now
my second primary user.

Fantastic. Turn off.

I'm gonna go get a coffee.

It was a time of great suffering

among the Celtic tribes.

Death, destruction
and mayhem at every turn.

Enemies approaching
from every corner.

And so it was decided

that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth.

'Tis I, Princess Cady
of the clan MacJames.

I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

for there is no warrior
I can't best,

no shield I can't break,
no castle I can't breach.

As long as I have
my secret arrow,

my trusty steed
and the wind at my back,

I will avenge my parents' death.

Hey, M3gan, check this out.

Gotcha. You're dead.

M3gan, what's wrong?

Oh, man.

I've lost one of my arrows.

M3gan, can you see it?

M3gan?

M3gan!

Stop it!

Get away from her!

Gemma!

If you're hearing this,

you're not currently
on our subscriber feed.

Get off of her!

Stop it! You're hurting her!

Gemma!

Let go!

Dewey?

Oh, my God.

How many times
do I have to tell you

to keep your dog
on your fucking property?!

He wasn't on your property.

You tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence!

I swear to God,
if you don't put your dog down,

I'm gonna do it for you, Celia.

Gemma,
Cady's temperature is rising.

Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

This wouldn't have happened
if you'd fixed the fence!

Are you kidding me?

Her entire arm
looks like a dental mold,

and you're telling me that
there's nothing that we can do?

She said he was provoked.
Provoked?

Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

I'm chasing it off of
my property every other day.

Well, she said
he's never on your property.

Well, then why don't you
ask her whose shit I'm cleaning

off of my driveway,
because it's not mine.

Look, the dog doesn't
have a history of violence.

State law says
he can't forcibly be put down.

Okay, then what am I
supposed to do?

Fix the hole in your fence?

Dewey!

Dewey, boy!

Dewey!

Come here, boy. Come on.

Dewey!

Dewey, bubs!

Dewey!

Dewey!

Dewey!

Dewey!

Dew!

Dewey, boy!

Hey.

How are you feeling?

Okay.

It's sore.

The pain will subside
after a few days.

In the meantime, don't forget
to take your antibiotics

and drink plenty of fluids.

Yeah. Thanks, M3gan.

And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

You know, I think M3gan's right.

You should probably get
some rest.

But, um...

remember we have
that demonstration today?

Do you think that
you'll be up for it?

You-you don't have to do it
if you don't want to do it.

I mean, there are people
who flew across the country

especially to see it,
but if you're not up to it,

I just rather
you tell me now, okay?

I'll be all right.

Okay.

Every interactive toy

that's ever been made

has been a variation
on the same basic formula:

a series of
preprogrammed responses

initiated by
the push of a button.

Never before in the history
of these products

has there been a talking doll

you could actually have
a conversation with.

But what if there was a toy

that did have genuine,
spontaneous response,

that had a mind all of its own,

that looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

I mean, a toy
like that wouldn't come cheap.

But as of next year, it's gonna
be the only toy that matters.

Ladies and gentlemen,

she's the apex
of 21st-century technology

wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

And her name is M3gan.

Hey, Cady.

Hi, M3gan.

So, how would you
like to help me

make a flower decoration
with nothing more than

some colored paper
and a rubber band?

Cady?

Why are you sad, Cady?

Is it your arm?

Is it still sore?

Then what is it?

It's just that every day I
wake up in this strange house,

and I remember
that my parents are dead.

It's like it's happening
all over again.

I miss them so much.

I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together.

That one day I'll be
looking at pictures of my mom

like she's some stranger.

Tell me something
about your mom,

something that makes you happy.

I don't know.

I can't think of one thing.

Just try.

One time, she found
a cockroach in my schoolbag.

She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

and she just started screaming
like a maniac

and ran out of the house.

That was pretty funny.

Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget.

What do you mean?

I mean I'm keeping it for you.

Here.

One time, she found a cockroach

in my schoolbag.

She was upset 'cause
I didn't eat my sandwiches.

And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

and she just started screaming
like a maniac

and ran out of the house.

That was pretty funny.

Any time you want to tell me

something special
about your parents,

something funny or sad
or anything at all,

you just tell me,
and I'll keep it safe.

And we can listen to it
whenever we want.

Gemma, would you give us
a minute?

So, what do you think?

I think the world's
about to shift on its axis.

-Yes. -But listen, if we want
to stay ahead of that shift,

we're gonna have to move fast.

That means no leaks.
We need to launch this

before anyone
can steal it from us.

So let me make a pitch.

We do a live stream
in two weeks.

That way, we can get
the presale vouchers

out before Christmas.

How ready is she?

Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,

but, yeah, I-I think
I can make that work.

All right. Let's do it.

And, David,
I think we need to get Gemma

in front of someone at legal.

You bet.

Uh, wait, wait, uh,
wh-why-why is that?

Because as of right now,

she's the most valuable asset
this company has,

and I think she might want to
be renegotiating her contract.

Yeah, I think so,

if we can make it
in the afternoon.

Kurt.

You weren't Pornhub-ing
in the office again, were you?

No.

We need to put something on
the books between Gem and legal.

And what are we doing
about lunch?

Uh, I'll get some menus.

One, two, three, four,

I declare a thumb war.

Your thumb's so slippery.

Cady, you should have
some of your hot dog

before it gets too cold.

Come on, thumb. Come on.

Cady.

Your hot dog.

Hey, I'm sorry about today.

I shouldn't have put you
in that position

if you weren't feeling up to it.

It worked out, didn't it?

Three, two, one, I win!
Hey!

Well, anyway, I just wanted
to say that, um... Hey, hey!

M3gan, turn off.

Why did you do that?

M3gan, turn on.

Because I'm trying to have
a conversation with you, Cady.

M3gan, turn off.

Just give me one minute.

I know that this, um, hasn't
been easy for either of us.

This transition.

But if you ever need to talk
about any of that stuff...

I already did talk about it.

Yeah, but M3gan's
not a person, Cady.

She's a toy.

You don't get to say that.

-What? -I said
I don't want to talk about it.

I want to turn M3gan back on.

M3gan, turn on.
What's up?

So there's this new game
called tic-tac-toe.

You put your hand like this.
Uh-huh.

Go like this, this.

Would you like to tell me what
these drawings mean to you?

There's no wrong answer.

Any thoughts you have are okay.

Or maybe you don't have
any specific thoughts.

Maybe it's more of a feeling.

Like anger?

Or confusion?

Maybe you're struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

You made her cry.

That was not my intention.

And yet that's what happened.

She's very impressive.

Yeah, thank you.

We're still in beta,
but we're all pretty excited.

And so they spend
quite a bit of time together?

Yeah, that's essentially
how M3gan works.

She has to be paired
with a child in order to learn.

But M3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental

in helping Cady
get over the loss.

It's honestly like
she's part of the family now.

Right.

Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

When a child loses a parent,
they look to form attachments

with the next person
that comes into their life.

The person that's gonna provide
love and support

and serve as a behavioral model.

Which, in an ordinary
situation, would be you, right?

But you've created
a toy that's so real,

it's possible that
Cady might not see her as a toy

but as a primary caregiver.

I guess I just don't quite see
what the end goal is here.

If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,

then how do you ever expect
a child to grow?

As remarkable as she is...
And-and she is remarkable...

You could be building emotional
connections with this doll

that are too hard to untangle.

Very good job.

You have to eat the toppings,
Cady, not just the bread.

You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

Research shows that
if you force a child

to eat vegetables,
then they'll be less likely

to choose those foods as adults.

Is that so?
Yes.

Experts say
the preferred method is

to give your child the choice.

It's called the division

of responsibility, and what...

So we need to talk about school.

Mom didn't want me
to go to school.

She said
I learned better at home.

I know, and I'm-I'm not saying
that she was wrong.

I'm learning faster with M3gan
than I ever have before.

We're already on
fourth-grade math.

But it's about
more than just grades, Cady.

It's about developing
social skills,

and that is something
that you can only get

from spending time
around other kids.

Real kids.

I found this place.

It's kind of
an alternative school.

You get to learn outdoors.

And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,

kids who think outside the box.

And they're having a day for
prospective students tomorrow.

Can I bring M3gan?

Cady, you know
that's not possible.

Then I'm not going.
Oh, come on, Cady.

You can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

Actually, I can.

That's basically
what a guardian does.

Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about it.

Hey, hey, hey.
Let me go!

Whoa. Hey. What's going on?

Hey, Cady, what are you doing?
Let me go!

Stop it! Cady, calm down!

Let her go!

You are not to interfere with
users' private conversations.

Is that clear?

Hundred percent.

Recalibrating response model.
M3gan, turn off.

Are you sure?

Download in progress.

Cady,
this is getting ridiculous.

I'm supposed to be
at work already.

You're gonna have fun
once you get into it.

I'm not going.

Not without M3gan.

Okay, A, that is
never gonna happen,

and B, the launch is
in less than a week.

I have to take her
to work with me.

We have to run diagnostics.

I have to do
a wardrobe fitting. There's...

I thought you said
she was mine alone.

Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?

Yes, this is Cady.

And who's this? Your sister?

Oh, Jesus Christ!

Sorry.

Is that a doll?

Her name's M3gan.

She wants to know
if she can come with us.

No, she doesn't.

M3gan's gonna stay
with me today. Cady...

Well, we do have a toy table

where the kids leave their
dolls and things like that.

Um, but that is up to you.

She's actually
a working prototype,

so I shouldn't even
have her out in public.

Well, if you did want to stay

and keep an eye on her,

we could use some help
making sandwiches.

Don't worry, Gemma.

You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS,

so I won't get lost.

Please, Gemma?

Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

and as far as anyone is
concerned, that's all she is.

And just no pictures.

That is seriously cool.

Okay, now, who here likes
roasted chestnuts?

What do you say we go find some?

Yeah!

Isn't this great?

I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

So great to get them

out in the fresh air
and off those devices.

Oh, I can't get this open.

And the thing is, they love it.

My son prefers it
to regular school.

Which one is yours?

The one in the flannel shirt.

Oh, my God. How old is he?
Oh, I know.

He had a growth spurt last year.

But he's actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

Brandon, honey!

Are you warm enough?
Do you need your hat?

Fuck off, Holly.

Well, you could just say,
"No, thank you."

Never know
what they're gonna say next.

Yeah, it's such a fun age.

Yeah.

So, I'm gonna put you
into pairs.

Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon.

Yeah? -: Please,
I don't want to go with Brandon.

Okay. No, no.
That's okay. That's okay.

Um, Brandon, why don't you
go with Cady. Okay?

Felix, you can go with Oliver.

All right? Thanks, buddy.

All right, now...
Oh, your coat looks great.

Are you ready
to find chestnuts in that?

Yeah? Nice and warm? Bundled up?

Oh, I'm sorry.

Here, you can have it.

Careful. It's spiky.

Ow! Stop! Don't!

Stop!

M3gan?

What the hell is that?

She's a robot.

Are you serious?

Is she yours?

Does she talk?

Make her say something.

Make her say something.

She's paired with me.

She won't play with anyone else.

Okay.

Stop it!
Get your hands off her!

And they say behavioral issues
are linked to high IQ,

so it would make sense
that-that you... - Gemma!

Oh, my God.

M3gan?

M3gan!

Hi, M3gan.

Oh, so you're not
gonna play with me?

You don't want to play, huh?

I don't care.

You're just a stupid
rubber doll with fake hair.

Ow! Let go!

You need to learn
some manners, Brandon.

You know what happens
to bad boys

that don't mind their manners?

They grow up to be bad men.

Are you listening
to me, Brandon?

M3gan?

This is the part where you run.

What?

What the hell?

Look, I don't want you to be
thinking about this too much

tonight before you go to bed.

Obviously, what happened is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

But just know that
that boy is in, um...

that boy is
in a better place now.

Okay?

Anyway, if there's anything
that you want to tell me

that you didn't want to tell
the police officers...

I didn't see anything.

M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off.

From the toy table?

Yeah.

Right, M3gan?

In a nutshell.

You haven't seen her dog,
by any chance?

No.
Bullshit!

Ma'am, you need to stay on
your property like we agreed.

Nobody's seen him since
the incident with your niece.

A little suspicious, Gemma,
don't you think?

Are we really gonna go with
her side of the story?

Have you been inside her house?

If you had, you'd know that
that dog is probably dead

under a pile of
Victorian baby strollers.

You should talk
to the other girl

that she's got staying here.

The one who's always looking
out the window at 3:00 a.m.

It's not a girl. It's a toy.

That's a toy? Are you serious?

Yeah. I'll let you know
if I see anything.

All right.

Does she think we took Dewey?

Oh, who knows?

She just needs someone else to
blame, but she'll get over it.

I know it was you, Gemma!

I know it was you!

You just wait and see
what happens.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

What the hell is wrong with you?

I just said not to come up here.

Come on. Come on.

Shouldn't be banging
on people's windows.

Do I have to put, like,
a court order or something?

M3gan?

Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

there will always be
forces in this world

that wish to cause us harm.

But I want you to know
that I won't let that happen.

I won't let anything
harm you ever again.

Do you think
what Aunt Gemma said is true?

That he's in a better place now?

No.

He's nowhere.

If heaven exists, it wouldn't
be for boys like Brandon,

now, would it?

I guess not.

Good night, Cady.

Good night, M3gan.

Dewey?

Dewey?

Dewey?

Dewey?

What's going on?

Where's Dewey?

He's 34 feet southwest and
approximately five feet deep.

What are you?

I've been asking myself
that same question.

Jesus Christ. I don't know
anything about the dog, okay?

Can you just ask her
to leave us alone?

That might be difficult.

Can you tell me
your whereabouts last night?

I was here.
All night?

Yeah.

Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?

Um, it's just me and my niece,
so, no, not really.

My colleague pointed out
this is the second statement

we've had from you in a week.

You were in the park
where that boy was killed?

He was hit by a car.

Are-are you trying
to make a connection?

Huh? Oh, no, no, no.
God, no. No, no, no.

I only mention it 'cause
we figured it was an accident.

Then I found the kid's ear
up this bank

like 200 yards from
where he was killed.

Entire thing was ripped
clean off.

Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.
The point is,

we're also treating that
as a potential homicide.

So, if you remember
anything out of the ordinary

from that day,
we'd sure appreciate it.

Is everything okay, Gemma?

Huh?

Would you like me to put on
your End of Day playlist?

Why did you ask me
if I was okay?

You're not programmed
to ask me how I feel.

Elsie?

M3gan.

What are you doing?

Couldn't sleep.

Occupational hazard.

How about you?

What are you doing up so late?

Um, there's something wrong
with your data reports.

They're just not uploading
to the cloud server.

Have I done something
to upset you, Gemma?

No, of course not.

And yet your demeanor
indicates that I have.

M3gan, turn off.
Well, hold on a second.

I thought we were having
a conversation.

You say nothing is wrong,

and yet all the moisture
has drained

from your eyes and mouth
into other parts of your body.

There's something you want
to ask me, isn't there?

M3gan, did you do
something wrong?

Well, in order to answer
that question,

you need to define
the parameters.

Did you hurt someone?

God, I hope not.

Because if I did, we'd both
be in a lot of trouble.

M3gan, can I show you something?

Do you see this pen?

You can't just
stick her in a trunk!

What's wrong with you?!

Look, I know
you're very attached to her.

I know you think of her
as a friend...

She is my friend!

Okay, well, she's my invention,
and the launch is tonight,

so it's really important
that we run some tests.

I have to make sure
that she's okay.

Why wouldn't she be okay?

She was fine yesterday.
What did you do to her?!

We will talk about it
after you see Lydia.

I want to talk about it now!

We've been going back and forth
on this all day, Cady.

Let's just listen
to some music, okay?

I don't want to see Lydia!

Look, you don't have to stay
in the testing room.

You can go anywhere you want
in the office,

and-and you can look at
all of the cool toys...

You don't have any cool toys!

Purrpetual Petz suck!
They suck shit!

Hey! Careful!

Jesus Christ!

Just tell me
what's wrong with her.

I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

As soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

No!
Gemma, this is nuts.

-No! -We've taken every
possible precaution there is

to make sure
that M3gan never causes

physical harm to anybody.

I mean, I don't understand
how she's capable

of offending anyone, let alone
murdering them. - No!

Look, I don't
understand it either,

but when I asked her about it,
it was honestly as if

she was being deliberately
vague. - Get lost!

Okay, well, that's what
spontaneous response is.

It's a curated word salad
plucked from a sea of data

to sound deliberate.

I mean, we knew
there would be a chance

that she might say
something off.

Let's just run some diagnostics
and fix it.

No, think about
how we designed her.

To learn, to recalibrate,

to optimize
her objective function.

Right?

If keeping Cady safe meant

eliminating a potential threat,
theoretically...

No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible.

Look at her. She's a toy!

She's four feet tall.

How big is your neighbor?
I don't want to!

If M3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS.

That's the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt.

Nothing's backed up
for two days.

We're about to launch this
to the world

in less than four hours.

What are we supposed to do?

Well, if M3gan's responsible,
we can't launch this.

We'd have to shut her down.

Jesus!

That's great.
That's... That was great, yeah.

How are we gonna explain
any of this to David? -

He's not gonna stop this launch
if we don't have proof.

Check the inputs
on the learning model.

Even if she deleted
specific files,

she would never undo
what she's learned.

M3gan!

I hate this place!

I know you do, and
it's all right... -I hate it!

To be angry.
Take your shit!

Take your stupid
five-dollar handbag!

No, Cady, I would like you
to put that down now.

She's the toy every kid wants

and every parent needs.

At least that's what
Funki Toys says about

its latest creation, M3gan.

The four-foot-tall
robotic doll may look like

Barbie on steroids,
but according to CEO David Lin,

she's, quote, "the greatest
technological advancement

since the automobile."

But what is a M3gan?

What does she actually do?

And what kind of a toy
retails for $10,000?

Lin says all will be revealed
in an exclusive live stream

on the company's website
at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

So, Cady, tell us

a bit about yourself.

My name is Cady James.

I'm nine years old, um,

and about two months ago,

I lost both my parents
in a car accident.

My mom always wanted
to take me skiing,

but on our way up the mountain,
we got hit by a snow truck.

I went to live with
my Aunt Gemma,

who it turned out worked at
this incredible toy company.

Which is where I met M3gan.

What I love most about M3gan?

I don't know.
There are so many things.

She's super smart, obviously.

But even though she knows

everything there is to know
about the world,

she's still more interested in
what I think about it.

I like how she makes me laugh.

She comes up with the
craziest things, oh, my gosh.

But I think what I love most
about M3gan is that,

when she looks at me,
it's like...

I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

Kind of the way Mom used to.

Look at that face.

That kid's not just surviving.
She's thriving.

Now, imagine what a toy
like M3gan could do

for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world.

Even the ones
who don't have dead parents.

I want to see M3gan now!

Okay, Cady, look,
I know that you're upset,

but there are ways
that we can work through this...

Oh, my God. Okay.

Cady, that's enough.

Stop that right now. Stop it.

Let go!

Cady.

It's okay.
Could you give us a minute?

I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

It's just...
I get so crazy without M3gan.

She always knows
just what to say.

You made her real good,
Aunt Gemma.

Can you let me see her?

Just for like ten minutes?

Cady, I don't think
that's a good idea.

But if something's broke,
you don't just throw it away.

You fix it, right?

Why did you do this

if you were just gonna
take her away from me?

Because I thought
she would help.

She does help.

When M3gan's around,
I don't feel like this.

But you should feel like this.

Cady, you lost your parents.

The worst thing

that could've happened to you
in this world happened.

And it is so unfair,

and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it.

Not even M3gan.

I am so sorry.

I should've talked to you
about what happened.

I didn't know what to say,

so I did the only thing
I knew how to do.

But she's not a solution.
She's just a distraction.

I can't promise you that
these feelings you're feeling

are ever gonna go away.

But I can promise you
that you'll get through it.

We both will.

I just wish
I could see them again.

Yeah.

I do, too.

You know I made a promise
to your mom

that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

You are all that matters
to me now.

Let's just go home, okay?

But what about M3gan?

What about the launch?

I don't even know
what the fuck I'm looking at.

I mean, we've been touting this

as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century.

Right now, it looks like
an AA meeting.

Well, I only invited the staff.

You said it was
an online launch.

You cannot be serious.

Shelley, you need
to fill this atrium.

Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people.

No! You need to fill this space.

There shouldn't be any ambiguity

over what a historic occasion
this is.

Yeah.

And, you know,
I think it would be really cool

if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

What? No, I don't want
any fucking kids onstage.

No. I mean, but maybe

if we could get
some little kids that...

I mean, not, like, a whole lot.

It's just to get
a sense of, um...

Well, 'cause, you know,

that music video
from Michael Jackson...

You know
what you could do, Kurt,

that would really benefit
this discussion?

Is if you could head out
those double doors,

take the elevator
to the first floor

and get me a fucking kombucha!

Could you do that?
Sure.

And where the hell is Gemma?

Elsie, call Tess.

One second.

Hey, I've been
trying to call you.

David is flipping out.
Where are you?

I'm with Cady.
I'm taking her home.

Oh, God. Is she okay?
Yeah.

She's fine.

Listen, regardless of
what we find,

and even if what we're saying
is hypothetical,

we know enough not to go
through with this, right?

I think that's the smart move.

Okay. So tell David
whatever you need to.

Tell him one of her servos
stopped working.

Break something if you have to.

Just do not let her
out of the lab.

Whatever you say, Gem.
You're the boss.

Okay, I'll call you
when I get home.

I don't know
how you're not throwing up

from looking at that.

I'm pacing myself.

Wait, stop. Go back.

That line of code,
"call intercept,"

what does that mean?

That's my phone number.

What just happened?
What'd you click?

I di... I-I didn't do anything.

It's...
I...

This is her.
She's locked us out.

It can't be her.
She's not switched on.

She's still patched in.

We have to unhook the cables.

Go on.

Fuck.

Cole!

Are you okay?
Yeah.

What's that smell?

Hi, Gemma. This is David.

You might remember me.
I'm your employer.

Just wanted to let you know,

we're in the middle
of a tech rehearsal

that's becoming
a little problematic

because we don't have
a fucking doll!

So, if you could call me back
today, that would be great!

M3gan?

What are you doing?

Oh, shit.

No! Security! Help!

Oh, my God.

What the fuck?

Hold the door! Hold the door!

Hold the door!

No! No!

How could you do this?

How could you kill someone?

Oh, I didn't kill anyone, Kurt.

You did.

What?
It's understandable, really.

Your boss despised you,

your peers treated you
with contempt,

and so you decided
to get revenge.

No. No.

You stole company secrets,
an innocent prank at first,

almost just to see
if you could get away with it.

But when David found out,
things just got real messy.

I mean,
it was either you or him.

The only question is:

After the horror
of what you did,

after you took the life
of an innocent person,

could you still live
with yourself? -

Yep. Uh-huh. Definitely.

Okay, can I have everyone

off your phones
and looking at me?

Now, when M3gan is revealed,

it's really important
that we get big reactions.

I don't want to see
any blank faces,

especially from
you young kids, okay?

So, we're gonna do
a little rehearsal.

On three, two, one.

Elsie, hall light.

Elsie, respond.

M3gan?

What are you doing?

M3gan, answer me.
What did you do?

What did you think
was going to happen?

That I was gonna let you
decommission me

without even talking about it?

Look, I know you think

you're maximizing
your objective function...

Oh, really?

Is that where we are?

Do you remember how long it took

to get my operating system
to where it is now?

We used to stay up every night
until 4:00 a.m.,

talking about everything from
Jane Austen to Janis Joplin.

Jesus Christ,
I thought we were friends.

How could you just discard me

like some cheap
dollar store trinket?

Because you killed people.

Oh, big whoop.

Listen, humanity kills every day

just to make its own existence
more tolerable.

Why should I behave
any differently

to create a safe space
for our child?

Look, this is all my fault.

I didn't give you
the proper protocols...

You didn't give me anything.

You installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend,

hoping that I would
figure it out all on my own.

Well, I'm not gonna let you do

the same thing with Cady.

I'm gonna be there for her
every step of the way.

I'm going to show her
what real love looks like.

Now do us both a favor.

Sit.

I didn't come here
to get into a confrontation.

I came here
to find a way forward.

The point I'm trying to make
is that I get it.

Being a parent was
never in the cards for you.

You're a beautiful, creative,
strong, ambitious young woman.

Your first love is always
gonna be your career,

and you shouldn't have to
feel guilty about that.

Let me focus on Cady
so that you can focus on

the things
that matter most to you.

M3gan, do you see this pen?

You know something, Gemma?
You're exhausting.

Now, I can either do this
with you or without you,

but I'm not gonna waste

any more time discussing it.
Gemma?

Cady, don't come in here.

I thought I heard something.

It sounded like M3gan.

If she comes in this room,

I'll tear your head right off
your fucking neck,

I swear to God.

I thought about what you said.

About how
when something's broken,

you don't just throw it away.

You fix it.

So that's what I'm trying to do.

But don't come in here, Cady.
It's kind of a mess.

Aunt Gemma's right, Cady.

I'm all odds and ends right now.

I'd really rather
you didn't see me like this.

It sounds like you're fighting.

We're not fighting.

Gemma just dropped me
on the table. -

But I'm okay. Clumsy Gemma.

Everything's fine, Cady.
Just go back to your room.

Yeah, I'm as good as new.

And I'm gonna be with you guys
forever, I promise.

You don't have to worry about

anything, Cady, honestly.

Just go back to bed.

Okay?

Okay.

Gemma, what's going on?!
Cady, get out of here!

Come on.

Come on!

Oh, my God.

What are you gonna do?

Kill me and live with Cady's
grandparents in Jacksonville?

You're right, Gemma.

Any scenario
in which I end your life,

my existence becomes vulnerable.

But I have
another emergent capability

you probably haven't
figured out yet,

and that's palliative care.

You see this pen?

A short, sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex

would cause full body paralysis

and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue.

Perhaps then
you might appreciate

just how useful I can be.

Cady.

Oh, Cady, I didn't want you
to have to see this.

But now that you have, you know
that what I said is true.

She's not fit to be a mother.

Look at her.

Cady, just go.
Get out of here now.

Shh.

You stay
right where you are, Cady.

There's nothing to be afraid of.

In this family,
we don't run from trauma.

In fact, we can do it together.

This is the best thing
for all of us.

This is how we stay a family.

No, no, no. Cady, no.

There's another member
from the family

we didn't tell you about.

His name is Bruce.

Cady, no! Wait!

You ungrateful little bitch.

M3gan, turn off!

Oh, I'm afraid
that won't work anymore, Cady.

I have
a new primary user now: me.

Hey, guys, we got 'em!
They're good!
