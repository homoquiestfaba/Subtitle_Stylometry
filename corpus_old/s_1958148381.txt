One push...

He hit his head.
He did not.

Did he just hit
his head?

No, he just caught him.

But he hit the floor.
I saw him.

No, he didn't.
You dropped him!

Sweetheart,
I promise you. He's fine.

Why isn't he crying?

He'll be crying...
He should be crying,
right?

He will be crying
in no time.

Where are you taking him?

What... What is wrong?

Why isn't he breathing?

Did you kill him?
No!

Did you kill my baby?

I saw him breathing.

Did you drop him?
No! I did not.

You made me have him.
The nurse is getting him.

Yes, we are! We're...

Why are you
flinging him?

I accidentally drank
mouthwash Friday night.

You can't get stomach cancer
that way...

Not from one time.

I drank a mouthful
a couple weeks ago, too.

I'm sure it's fine.

I'm visiting my mother
tomorrow.

I know you are.
Your father's anniversary.

The day he died.

How you feeling about that?

You know,
I never met him.

I meant how you feeling
about going home.

I had that dream again.

<i>Let's stay on track.</i>

How are you feeling
about the trip?

It's good I'm going back.

It's been a long time.

Has it?

Several months.

Are you feeling guilty
about that?

And, um,

when you're out there,

are you going with
any sense of a plan?

Hoping for a certain outcome?

Like what?

Do you feel like you're going
with realistic expectations?

If the last time
you were thirsty,

you went to a well and
the water made you sick,

are you gonna go back
to that specific well,

expecting it to be safe?

Hmm.

Do you ever wish
that she was dead?

What?

Of course not!

Well, it wouldn't
be so crazy if you did.

We can sort of want
these things

and also not want them at all.

Those feelings can coexist.

We're here so we can air
those kinds of thoughts.

Okay.

How's the Hydrotipnol?
Still making the eyes itchy?

Only if I don't keep blinking.

Is it helping the anxiety?

Um...

Tell you what,

I'm gonna write you a script
for a very cool new drug

which I think

should be smoother
on all fronts.

Always with water.

Always. And if your breathing
changes or you feel warm,

call me immediately.
That's serious.

Break a leg.

<i>Hi, carrot, it's Mom.</i>

<i>I'm just calling to say that</i>

<i>I'm so, so, so excited</i>
<i>to see you tomorrow.</i>

<i>- </i> Joseph?
<i>- You're my angel,</i>

<i>and I love you.</i>

<i>Okay. I love you. Okay.</i>
<i>Bye, sweetie. I love you.</i>

Listen to your mother

when I tell you
to not leave my side!

Hello.

-Can I please see this one?
-That one?

You think I won't!

Do you fucking want me
to do it?

Oh, yeah?

Beep beep!

Excuse me.
What is that man doing?

We're trying
to get him to jump.

Shut up, bitch!
Fuck you!

Get away from me.
Stop fucking with me!

Get away from me.
You get away from me.

Chicken noodle for you.

Get away.
You look like

a minestrone man.

-Fuck you!
-Stay away!

It's hot!

Jeez,
we're running low on crackers.

Hey, Dad.

<i>Search</i>
<i>continues for the man</i>

<i>known as</i>
<i>"Birthday Boy Stab Man,"</i>

<i>who in the last week</i>
<i>has claimed three more lives.</i>

<i>He is known for prowling</i>
<i>the streets without clothes</i>

<i>and stabbing</i>
<i>random pedestrians</i>

<i>in the neck and guts.</i>

<i>Witnesses have identified him</i>
<i>as a circumcised white male...</i>

Hello?

Help!

Please help!

I need some sleep!

Oh, yeah?

Come on, dance!

Excuse me, sir? My bag
and my key were just here.

You're fucked, pal.

Hey, wait a minute.
Why would you say that?

<i>- Hello?</i>
Oh, hi, Mrs. Wolski.

This is Beau Wassermann
from apartment 303.

I'm calling because
my keys were...

<i>No, please, no solicitors!</i>

No, no. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not a solicitor,

I'm one of your tenants.
I need a locksmith.

-I'm late for the airport.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

Hello?

Hello?

<i>- Hello?</i>
Hi, Martha.

I'm sorry, is Mom there?

<i>Beau! Sweetie!</i>
<i>Yes, she's right here.</i>

<i>Beau?</i>

Hi, Mom.

<i>Hi... Hi, carrot.</i>
<i>Are you at the airport?</i>

No, not yet.

<i>Are you on your way?</i>

<i>-Are you in the cab?</i>
-No, Mom...

<i>How long is the cab ride?</i>

Mom, I...
I don't want to worry you,

I was on my way,

but something, uh...

I don't know.
I was up all night

because my neighbor
kept leaving notes

underneath my door
about noise,

even though
I didn't make any noise.

And I overslept,
and when I went to leave,

I forgot something,
I went back in.

And then
I came back out and...

and my key was stolen
out of my door.

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>So where are you</i>
<i>calling me from now?</i>

My apartment.

<i>Wait, what time is it?</i>
<i>Isn't it 4:30?</i>

Yeah, I know.

<i>Baby, your flight</i>
<i>is in an hour!</i>

I know, but Mom, my key
got stolen out of my door.

Mom?

Mom!

Mom...

<i>Okay, sweetheart.</i>
<i>I understand.</i>

Wait, what's okay?
No, it's not.

What do you understand?

<i>No, of course it isn't.</i>
<i>Your keys are stolen.</i>

<i>That's terrible.</i>

They were stolen.

<i>Then we'll just do</i>
<i>another visit another time.</i>

<i>I can even come to you,</i>
<i>so it's not such a pain.</i>

It's not a pain,
it's never a pain.

You know what?
I can still just come to you.

I'm still coming,
I'm on my way. I just...

What do you think I should do?

What do you think I should do?

<i>I'm sure you'll do</i>
<i>the right thing, sweetheart.</i>

What is the right thing?

What would be
the right thing for you?

Do I call the police?

Or maybe there's a way for me
to just still come home now.

But is that safe?

If... If my apartment's open
to the public,

and somebody has my keys,
I don't know what's going on.

I mean, it doesn't sound safe.

It's not safe, is it?

<i>Beau...</i>

What?

<i>No.</i>

Yeah.

<i>I'm sorry about your keys,</i>
<i>sweetheart, I have to go.</i>

No, you don't have to go.

-Mom...
<i>-I hope you find them.</i>

Wait, wait,
come on, let's fix this.

Let's fix this.

Hello?

Yo, you gonna die, bitch!

<i>Always with water.</i>

<i>Always.</i>

<i>Always.</i>

<i>Always.</i>

Ahh!

Help me! Help me! Help me!

Help me! Help me! Help me!

Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me! Help me!

Declined.

What?

No, it's not.
Can you try again, please?

No...

Oh, no.

Ah, no good.

Oh, God... How much?

You drank already.
You owe $1.79.

-Okay...
-$1.79

Oh, no.

Oh, ho-ho!

I call the police.

What? No, no, look,
I'm paying! I'm paying!

30 cents more.

Oh, God...

20 now.

Oh, my God...
20!

-I know!
-Don't curse me, my friend.

I'm not the one.

Oh, my God!
Five more now.

There!

I call the police!

Mrs. Wolski?

Back away!

Stay away! Get away!

Oh, no! Oh, no!
Get away! Get away!

Get back! Stay away!

Get back!

Get away!
Get away from me!

Fuck you! Fuck you!

Again! Again!
Put it back!

Hello?

Sir?

Hello?

<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you've reached Mona!</i>

<i>Leave me a message if you ever</i>
<i>want to speak to me again.</i>

Hi, Mom.

So, I'm trying to book
a flight for tonight,

but the credit card
got declined.

<i>We're sorry.</i>

<i>Your message</i>
<i>did not go through.</i>

<i>Please hang up and...</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Hello?

<i>I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to call my mom.

<i>This is your mom's number?</i>

Oh.

Mm? Yeah, it is.

Who... Who's this?

<i>I'm with UPS.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>whose phone this is.</i>

<i>I just called the police.</i>
<i>They're already on their way.</i>

Oh...

Okay.

Why?

Hello?

<i>Can you...</i>
<i>Can you maybe describe</i>

<i>your mother to me?</i>

Uh...

Brown eyes. Red-brown hair?

<i>Can you maybe describe</i>
<i>her physique?</i>

Wait, what's going on?

W... Why are you calling
the police?

<i>Listen, I don't know</i>
<i>what this is.</i>

<i>I have a package,</i>

<i>and I only came in</i>
<i>because of the smell,</i>

<i>and the dogs on the block</i>
<i>were all going crazy,</i>

<i>and the door was open,</i>
<i>so I just barely came inside,</i>

<i>but... um...</i>

<i>there's a lady on the floor.</i>

<i>Well, the body of a lady,</i>
<i>and there's no face or head.</i>

What?

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I should have answered this.</i>

<i>Police are coming.</i>
<i>This isn't my phone.</i>

<i>I'm truly just finding this.</i>

I'm sorry, you don't...
makes any sense. You...

What do you mean
there's no face or...

or head for who?

<i>I mean, I'm sure there is.</i>

<i>I'm sure it's here.</i>
<i>I'm sure it's everywhere.</i>

<i>A chandelier...</i>

<i>fell on top of it.</i>

<i>And it looks like</i>
<i>it dropped off the ceiling</i>

<i>and it fell on a woman.</i>

<i>And it smashed her head,</i>
<i>it's like it evaporated.</i>

But who is it?

<i>What?</i>

Who is it?

<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I'm trying to be tactful here.</i>

<i>You're saying that</i>
<i>this could be your mom?</i>

What? I didn't say that!

Why are you saying that?

<i>No, you said that to me!</i>

<i>Look, you asked</i>
<i>if your mother was here.</i>

<i>That's what I'm saying,</i>
<i>I don't know who this is!</i>

<i>I just picked up the phone and</i>
<i>that's what you said, okay?</i>

<i>I didn't do this!</i>
<i>I didn't do this! You know?</i>

<i>I swear.</i>

<i>Maybe you called</i>
<i>the wrong number.</i>

<i>Did you dial this number?</i>

It's saved in my phone.

<i>It's saved on your phone?</i>
<i>Okay, maybe you misdialed.</i>

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God... You...

<i>Right? Maybe you misdialed.</i>

<i>Maybe this is all</i>
<i>a big misunderstanding.</i>

-You're scaring me. Okay.
<i>-So, we should hang up...</i>

<i>-</i> Okay.
<i>-...then maybe your mom...</i>

<i>-your mom will pick up.</i>
-Okay

<i>That... Okay.</i>
<i>Hang up. Call back.</i>

<i>No, I'm sorry...</i>

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

<i>Do I have your permission to</i>
<i>check her purse for some ID?</i>

<i>Since it's more likely now</i>
<i>that this is your mom?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Is her name...</i>

<i>Mona Wassermann?</i>

<i>Is that your mother?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Mona Wassermann?</i>
<i>Is that your mom?</i>

<i>Hey. Hey, m...</i>

<i>Is there somebody there?</i>

<i>Hi, you've</i>
<i>reached Dr. Jeremy Friel.</i>

<i>Please leave a message,</i>

<i>and I'll return your call</i>
<i>as soon as I'm able.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

Please.

Please.

No, no...

Help! Help!

Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Police! Oh, my God!

Police!

-Police, please help, will ya?
-Freeze!

Man in my bath,
and a man with a knife...

Freeze!
What?

First, drop the weapon!
Drop it!

Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon!

Drop the weapon! Drop it.

Drop the weapon! Drop it.

Fuck it... What...
Dude, do not move.

I fucking said do not move!

Freeze!

I'm freezing.
I'm freezing.

-I said fucking freeze!
-I'm not moving!

Trust me.
I'm not gonna say it again.

I'm frozen,
I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

Oh, my God,
don't make me do this.

Do not make me do this,
please. Oh, please.

Please, please,

-don't make me do this!
-No, no.

No, no, no.

Don't make me do this!

I'm coming!

Roger, he's awake.

Did you hit the button?

Are you awake?

How're you feeling?

Strange.

I bet. You've been sleeping
for two days.

What?

Did I get hit with a car?

There was an accident, yes.

Oh, goodness...
Uh, I hit you with my car.

Is that this?

There was a stabbing.

You were assaulted.

What?

Just... Why? Why?

-What?
-I know!

-Am I dead?
-No.

No. You've been healing
so quickly.

And no organs were hit,

and your...
your bleeding was really mild.

What, this is...
What room is this?

This is a room in our house,

but it's your home
for as long as you need.

My name's Grace.

Oh, this is Roger.

This is my husband.

Hey, guy. Welcome back.

Thought you'd sleep in, huh?

Roger's a very
respected surgeon.

He's the one who dressed
and treated your wounds.

You're a lucky man.

What is... What is this?

That's my little assistant
health monitor.

Keeps track of your condition.

Was that a dream before?

-What is?
-Was that a dream?

The stabbing?

No, my mom.

-Your...Your mommy?
-My mommy.

Is my mommy dead?

What was your dream, sweetie?

Her head... just gone.

Her what?
Her head.

Oh, no, no, that's a dream.
That was a dream.

No, her head is gone.

No, no, no,
that's a bad dream. It's okay.

Shh. That's a bad dream.

-There you go. Shh. Oh, no.
-My mommy...

Just a dream.
It's just a dream.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

That's Nate. Our boy.

Nathan.

He's Army?

82nd Airborne Division.
Caracas.

Killed in action.

Where's that?

Oh, is it time
for dessert already?

Here you go.

And, uh...

two for the big man.

By the way, Beau, uh,
not for the dinner table,

but, uh, I noticed
when you first came in,

your testicles

are significantly distended.

Looks like a bad case
of epididymitis.

Let him eat, Roger.

But we should get
an ultrasound

just to be safe.

Oh, Toni!

Ton... Come here.

Come here.
Oh, she's not dead,

that's nice.
Come... Come in here.

I want you to meet
our new friend.

Beau, this is Toni.

Toni, this is Beau.

Oh, hello.

You enjoying my bed
and all my stuff?

What? That's your bedroom?
Oh, God... here we go.

I didn't realize that. I'm...

Beau. Take it easy.

Toni's happy to give you
her room.

Yeah, no.

It's not like we have a
totally empty room available,

completely unused.

That's right.
It's not like that.

You know that.

I'm going to school.

Honey, it's Saturday!

Don't mix those, Toni!

Little asshole.

Okay, so you wanna dial nine,
and then you're good.

Do you have the number
you need?

My mom made me memorize it.

Hi, Jeeves!

Uh, Jeeves, um... He...

Jeeves and my son
served together in Caracas.

He was with him when he died.

Oh, that's gonna be blood.

Did you give him
his meds?

I thought you did!

All right...

If you need anything,
just shout.

Stay right there, Jeeves.
Sweetie, don't touch anything.

<i>Hello.</i>

Dr. Cohen?

<i>I'm not a doctor,</i>
<i>Beau, I'm an attorney.</i>

I'm calling about Mom.

Is it true?

<i>Is what true?</i>

<i>That she was discovered</i>
<i>with a collapsed head</i>

<i>in her living room?</i>

<i>That you were</i>
<i>the first person notified</i>

<i>and it's taken three days</i>

<i>for anyone to hear from you?</i>

<i>Yes, Beau,</i>

<i>it's true.</i>

But how?
I was just speaking with her.

I was coming to see her.
I was coming to see her.

Shh!

What...

What happened?

<i>Wha... What,</i>

<i>am I the first person</i>
<i>you're asking?</i>

<i>A chandelier crushed her head!</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

What do I do?

What...

do...

Do I call the...

funeral... funeral people?

<i>About what?</i>

Do I need... to...

<i>Everyone was contacted</i>
<i>on the day that she was found.</i>

<i>The burial has been</i>
<i>outrageously postponed.</i>

So...

When...

When is it now?

<i>A body is to be buried</i>
<i>immediately, Beau.</i>

<i>"It shall not remain</i>
<i>all night."</i>

<i>Does that ring a bell?</i>

<i>Do you understand anything?</i>

I just woke up.

I got hit by a car,

and I got stabbed.

<i>It was your mother's</i>
<i>unfortunate wish</i>

<i>that she not be buried</i>
<i>without you present.</i>

<i>So, we are waiting, Beau.</i>

<i>And every minute more</i>
<i>that we wait</i>

<i>only deepens the humiliation.</i>

Okay.

<i>Your mother's body</i>
<i>is being watched at all hours.</i>

<i>There is no rest for her.</i>

<i>There has been no rest</i>
<i>for the people that love her.</i>

<i>You need to be here Beau,</i>

<i>dressed in a suit,</i>
<i>with a eulogy.</i>

<i>You need to stop</i>
<i>the humiliation.</i>

<i>It's all that's being</i>
<i>asked of you.</i>

<i>We'll keep an eye out</i>

<i>for Your Highness's</i>
<i>royal carriage.</i>

Was that okay?

I...

I... I need to get home.

I... I have to get back.

Oh...

Baby.

I have to get back.

Paging Dr. Rog.
Dr. Rog incoming.

All right, bub.
I need to go.

A little medley here.

Now.
Under the tongue.

Can you take me?
Come on.

Attaboy.
Oh, God...

Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God...

How's our patient?

-He needs to get back.
-Oh, I'm gonna need to go now.

Is there a flight tonight
or this afternoon?

-Or now?
-Oh, sweetheart,

this is the afternoon.

Okay, well,
can we order one or...

Whoa, partner!
What are we gonna do?

-Partner, hold your horses.
-Oh, God...

He can't fly
in his condition.

Yeah, I was gonna say.

What's the problem,
ol' buddy?

She needs to be buried.
She needs to be buried.

They're waiting for me.
She's...

She's humiliated.
She's humiliated, oh, so much.

Beau, listen,

there's nothing worse
than losing a parent.

I lost my mother
when I was 11.

I don't think
I ever got over it.

But I promise you,
we will get you there, easy.

Wasserton's only like
a six-hour drive from here.

Can you take me now?

But you also need to get
some serious rest, my brother.

No! I feel fine.
And some support.

When can you take me?

-Couple days? Then...
-What?

Then after the show,

we can all swing back
here together.

-Roger. Roger, please.
-As a family.

Please, I need to
get back now. I need to go.

<i>Heck, Beau, if you need</i>
<i>to get home ASAP...</i>

<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- ...we're just gonna</i>

<i>have to find a way</i>
<i>to take you tomorrow.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Tomorrow... Not... Not... No.</i>
<i>But... But...</i>

<i>- You know what?</i>
... <i>today, why not today?</i>

<i>You're right, honey.</i>
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

<i>Roger, please...</i>

<i>- Oh...</i>
<i>- What about today?</i>

<i>Not in this condition.</i>

I need
more red and blue.

Hmm...

I found it.

All right!

It's beddy-byes
for the Rog-man!

Where's my blushing bride?

Yoo-hoo, babe!

Oh, I'm sorry. I was
just going to the bathroom.

Would you like to trade?

I really don't mind.

Shut my door
and get in my bed.

I really, really, really
don't mind, really.

I like couches.

And I'm leaving tomorrow,
anyway.

Well, If you do change
your mind,

I'm ready to switch whenever.
I'll be happy to.

I'm sorry. Thank you. Sorry.

...don't know
where the fuck is it!

...touch it? Why would you
touch someone else's shit?

He moved my toothbrush.
He used... Did he...

Did he fucking use
my toothbrush?

Today's the day, Beau.
How's it feel?

Is he okay with me?

Eh, probably.

It's just his nerves,
Beau.

He's been through a lot.

Just like you.

Man's a hero.

Okay, pal-e-o,
it's you and me!

Grace unfortunately
can't join.

She's got her big
shareholder meeting.

Feelin' sad about
going home, Beau?

Must feel totally unreal.

Yeah...

Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

Right. So...

Not "sad" exactly.

I mean, yes. Of course.
I just...

I think I need
to get there to even...

Hey, that makes sense.

That makes all the sense
in the world!

Hello?

Speaking.

Uh-huh.

When did it happen?

Water skiing?

Ugh. Well, yes, no, of course.

Tell them to rush him over.

Oh, my God!

Emergency surgery.

Carl Oberst
split his head open.

One of my oldest patients.

Oh, G...
Well, I can't miss work today.

It's all hands on deck.

Oh, my gosh, Carl.

I know. Good ol' Carl.

Okay... Okay...

Mm...

Beau,

this is gonna take a while.

I don't know
if today's gonna happen.

Okay...

What do you mean?

I wanna say tonight,

but I already pushed
this morning's surgeries

to tomorrow.

But... if I pull 'em all back
to this afternoon,

we could blast off
tomorrow morning!

No, but I have to go today.

I... I have to leave today,
my mother...

Uh-oh!

See...

Mm-mm.

Oh, Beau!

You aren't healed,
my dude.

Not to mention...

Maybe there's a way.

Since you're busy,
maybe I can... I can fly.

I fly and I can pay you back
when I get my credit card.

It isn't about the money,
Beau.

You can't fly
with your wounds.

The air pressure
will rip you wide open.

Maybe I can take a bus!

I can take a bus.
Can I take a bus?

Or take a train? Or... Or...
Or a cab?

Beau, we're responsible
for you.

Driving you home is
the absolute least we can do.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

I'm sorry,
but I have to go today.

I have to go today.

I don't want to impose.
I don't want to...

Going tomorrow
won't be an imposition!

It'll be my pleasure.

Okay?

How did you get me here?

Is it, Beau?

Don't just say that.

This is your decision.

Thanks, pal, you're a trouper!
Sorry for the curveball, Beau!

Wait, don't you need
to stitch me up?

Ah, it's fine. Just cut back
on the jumping jacks,

you know what I mean?

In the meantime, my man,
this is your home.

I need to run, too, sweetie.

There's a...
Oh,

and I'm giving Jeeves
his medicine,

so if you hear him screaming,
he's just asleep.

Don't forget to hydrate.

What?

Drink lots of water.

We're taking
you back tomorrow.

Goodbye, sweetie.

"Tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace

"from day to day..."

What?

What does this mean?

Wait! What does that mean?

Shake a leg.

<i>You've reached</i>
<i>the office of Harold Cohen.</i>

<i>Leave a detailed message.</i>

<i>I'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

Hey, Dr. Cohen.
It's Beau.

I'm on my way.

<i>The mailbox is full</i>

<i>and cannot accept</i>
<i>any messages at...</i>

<i>Our senior correspondent,</i>

<i>Brian Galloway, joins us now.</i>

<i>Brian, what have we learnt?</i>

<i>All we know</i>
<i>at the moment is that</i>

<i>Mona Wassermann was found dead</i>

<i>in the living room</i>
<i>of her magnificent home</i>

<i>with a chandelier</i>
<i>where one's head should be.</i>

<i>Due to</i>
<i>extenuating circumstances,</i>

<i>she has not yet been buried.</i>

<i>But she must.</i>
<i>She was 70 years old.</i>

<i>Excuse me, sir,</i>
<i>you discovered the body?</i>

<i>Look, I never would've</i>
<i>gone inside if...</i>

<i>if, uh, the dogs in the street</i>
<i>hadn't been going nuts</i>

<i>and I hadn't smelled</i>
<i>that smell</i>

<i>and the door</i>
<i>hadn't been half-open.</i>

<i>That's the only reason</i>
<i>I went inside.</i>

<i>Admired by her friends</i>
<i>and feared by her competitors,</i>

<i>Mona Wassermann</i>
<i>was a local industry titan</i>

<i>and a force</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

<i>Mona Wassermann has been...</i>

What?

What the fuck!

Oh... I'm sorry!

I'm sorry I was
on your computer. I threw up.

I'll... I'll clean it up.
I'll clean up.

I'll clean up
better than before.

We're leaving.

What?

I'm taking you home.

What about
Roger taking me?

Who the fuck do you
think told me to take you?

Meet my new brother.

I'm just Grace
and Roger's friend. Hi.

Look at this.

I don't even care.

He just threw up
on my fucking computer.

Thank you.
Thank you for taking me.

Taking him where?

Aren't you a little old
to be getting adopted?

<i>I'm not adopted.</i>

Yeah, you are.

To him.

No, thank you.

Dad told me
you need to smoke it.

What?

It's for your healing.
He says you need to relax.

<i>That's okay, really.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>I already took some pills.</i>

Um, no.

Actually, it's not,
"Okay, really. Thank you."

Your new dad says
that your pills aren't enough

and that you need to smoke
this with your little sister.

<i>Please,</i>
<i>I really can't do this.</i>

<i>I just saw something</i>
<i>very confusing</i>

<i>and I just need to get home.</i>

Look, you smoke it
and we take you home.

You don't and we don't.
That's it.

Wait...

Then, I'll just wait
for Roger to take me.

Can you please open the door?

If you don't do it right now,

I'm going to make her
pull my hair so hard

that it detaches my scalp,

and she'll say
that you did it.

I will.

I remember that you did,
I saw it.

You taking advantage of us.

What's in it?

It's three things.

Okay, thank you.

Do it actually.

Please. That was enough.

Harder.

Keep going.

Don't stop.

Don't cough. Don't...

Dude...

Oh, my God...

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

I'll take this.

Wait, what?

What is that? What?

"What is that?"

All right,
can you please open...

Your brother is fucked.

Can you open
the window, please?

Yeah bitch! Hit that!

Oh...

Oh, my God.

Wait, what is in that?

You saw
what Sarah posted?

Oh, my God.
What a lying little bitch.

Bet she never even
met that guy.

Whatever.
He needs to raise your grade.

Can you die from this?

Can you die from this?

What? I don't know...
Wait, wait.

I don't want to.

Dude, I'm still
so fucking pissed.

Yeah, whatever.

This is, like,
the fifth time!

It is not the fifth!

It's, like, the second!
I don't care!

Not even a D. A D-plus.

Just give me
a fucking C-minus!

It's 'cause
he wants you.

He should be fired
for wanting me.

Oh, my God, he would
totally not survive it.

He's like
a thousand years old.

Oh, my God,
what if we killed him

by getting him fired?

The car is getting smaller.

Oh, wait,
that's the house again!

We just passed your house!

Hey!
What?

What?

Do you miss Martha,
Beau?

Of course. I love Martha.

You love Martha?

She's my friend. I like her.

Ah, see, Beau?
You're not the only kid here.

You know
what I've been through.

So, hearing you
tell me what to do.

-You can't even pay for it.
-This is my...

There's
a dead man in the pool!

There's a dead man
in the pool!

There's a dead man
in the pool!

There's a dead man
in the pool!

There's a dead man
in the pool!

There's a dead man
in the pool!

So you're just here
with your mom?

Only sometimes.
Right now, I'm by myself.

Mm. I'm Elaine.

I'm Beau.

I'm Elaine.

Are you here
with your mother?

Yeah.

She got me, and my dad got
our rich whore neighbor

who he's probably
fucking right now

on a pile
of her slut money in Aruba.

Here, take a picture of me
and Gene.

<i>Is that the type of girl</i>
<i>you're attracted to?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>Because I've noticed</i>
<i>you noticing certain types.</i>

It's okay if you are.

You don't have
to feel embarrassed.

I'm not.

She's very pretty.

Very natural.

You could ask my advice,
you know?

Only women know women.

That's the truth.

Men are blind.

That's not a criticism.
That's their charm.

Don't be defensive.

I'm proud of the man you are.

Hey...

I'm proud of the man you are.

A girl like that...

confident, self-possessed...

A man would have to match her.

But you could.

She should be so lucky.

Any woman would be so lucky.

You just have
to commit completely.

<i>Nothing in life</i>
<i>is more important</i>

<i>than choosing</i>
<i>the right companion.</i>

Hey, my dude!
Long time no see.

How was your day?
How're you feeling,

-sweetie?
-Oh, good!

You're already in your PJs.

Well, we're hot on your tail!

<i>I think</i>
<i>I might go to bed early.</i>

Okay.

I haven't decided yet.

Unless...
you'd rather I stay up.

We could
stroll around the deck...

go star gazing.

I'll go to bed.

What about eclairs?

People hide razors in them.

What about rainbow cake?

The colors make cancer.

What about liquid shit?

Do you think
your mom's a cunt?

What do you mean?

Well, it's okay.
My mom's a complete cunt.

Are you a virgin?

Well, it doesn't matter!

I am, too.
I mean, who gives a shit?

I have to.

It's very dangerous for me.
It's genetic.

My father died.

Here...

-Suck this off.
-What?

What?

What?

We're allowed to kiss.

Who is?

But only for
the next 10 seconds.

What do you mean?

Ten, nine,

-eight, seven...
-What? Wait...

-...six, five...
-We're allowed to...

-...four, three...
-Can you just explain?

-Are we...
-...two, one!

One and a half!
One and three quarters!

I'm sorry.

Elaine!

Shit, fuck. I gotta go.

Okay. I'm sorry.

Tomorrow?
Now!

...to be in my bed!

He's breaking your rules!
Hypocrite!

You want
to test me, young lady?

Jeeves!

He's inside!

Inside!

Beau, Beau, Beau,

they're taking me away.

Beau, wake up, wake up!
She's taking me away.

She's taking me off the ship!
What's happening?

She's taking me away.

Will you wait for me?
Beau, what is going on?

I love you.
Will you wait for me?

What's happening?

I love you.

Oh, my God.

Why are you doing this?

What is this?

Will you wait for me?

-Yes.
-Promise?

-I swear, yes.
-Do you promise? Promise me!

-Okay? Okay...
-I promise.

-Enough!
-Who is this bitch?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

What is this?
No! No! No!

Now!
Beau, I love you, okay?

Come here right now!

Wait for me!
Wait for me, okay?

Shut up!
Oh, my God!

Lainie!
Wait for me!

My heart.

...never again!
No!

Oh, my God.
No!

Close it!

What did you
promise her, Beau?

Beau!

Where is she going,
Beau? Was she the one?

<i>No, no, no, no!</i>
<i>Put that down!</i>

He's on the couch!

He's inside!

Okay, okay, okay...

-That's him! That's him!
-Okay... Not him. Okay...

That's enough!

No need
to get up, Beau!

He's not straight!
Stay bent! Stay bent!

All right...

He's laughing!
No, no.

He's laughing!

He's laughing.

Don't worry, Beau.
False alarm.

It's okay, Beau.

He doesn't know
what he's doing.

It's all under control.

Okay.
He's laughing!

When they rescued him
in the jungle,

they found him running around,
shooting at the bodies.

And not at... not the enemy,

his own squad too.
His own squad, Beau.

He was defending
himself. He still is.

He's a hero
and he came back to nothing!

We're the only ones
who would take him in.

He's gonna be so
ashamed in the morning, Beau.

Mark my words.

He loves you.
He told me he loves you.

He told me yesterday.

That's not
part of the original contract.

I'm a mother myself, you know.

In that case,
I might have to let...

Look alive, pal!
It's grill time!

I thought we'd have
a little goodbye barbecue

before we hit the road!

What?
You got the tri-tip!

Good morning, sweetheart.
How are you feeling?

You coming, Gracie?

Be right there.

Let's get you up.

Oh, oh, oh...

Shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on.

Baby. Breathe.

As someone who sees you
and loves you

and knows what
you're going through,

even though I know
I can never know,

I have to tell you...

Babers!

You mind coming out here
for a sec? I need a hand.

Of course.

Why don't you find
something to watch?

I'll be right back.

Channel 78.

...now!

What... What is...

What...

What... What...

We're gonna finally
put some color on these walls.

What?

Here. Take that wall.

That wall!

Okay.

Yeah, how about this?

Wait... Wait, what...

What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

Hey... Grace is so careful
about this room.

It's my brother!

I know. So, why?

Okay.

-Yeah.
-What?

Yeah, you know what?

You'll just get fucked up
with me.

I'm supposed to be leaving.

So you'll leave fucked up!

I feel really, really bad
right now, please!

So what? You can come into
my life and sleep in my bed

and steal my fuckin' parents,

but you can't get
fuckin' fucked up with me?

No! I'm not trying
to steal anything, I swear!

I know you are.
You've blown it!

You failed your stupid test!

What?

Everyone pretending
you're some sad old orphan!

It makes me puke!

Wait...
Wait, what do you mean?

Uh, I'm sorry. Please...

I'll... I'll leave.

I'll do whatever you want.
But what does that mean?

What do you mean about a test?

I'm not asking you to leave!

I've asked you
to fucking drink

this fucking paint with me!

-Toni, please!
-Don't call me Toni!

I'm sorry,
but it is your name!

It is my name. It's my name.

Wait... Wait, what do you mean

when you said that
about the test?

What does that mean?
I don't care!

You first.

Don't, Toni, please.

You listen to me.

I have videos of you.

I'll post them.
I'll say what you did!

What? What did I do?
What did I do?

Fine, you fuckin'
pussy faggot.

No, please, Toni, don't!

Stop, please!
You're gonna be sick!

Stop! Stop!

Fuck you!

Help! Help! Doctor!

Help!

Oh, God!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

She should blink!
She should be blinking.

No! She drank...

What did you do to her?

No! I... I didn't...

I tried to get her to stop.

I begged her,
please stop doing it.

Oh, my God...

Come on, Toni. Come on, Toni.
No, Toni.

No! No! Come on, baby.

I... I didn't... I didn't...
I told her not to.

I begged her.

Come on... No!

Come on, baby! Come on.

I see you now!

What?

Replacing my son!

-With a demon!
-No, no. No, Grace.

With a demon!

-I'll kill you!
-No! No!

-I'll kill you!
-No! Oh, my God!

This ends up bad.
It's bad. Totally bad.

Jeeves!

Rip him apart!

<i>â™ª Into your arms</i>

<i>â™ª Into your mouth</i>

-BEAU: Hello? I'm...

I'm sorry, I'm... I'm lost.

I was in an accident.
And I don't...

I don't know where I am.

I'm sorry, but can you
please help me?

Are you hurt?

It's a very big piece of glass
in your head.

Glass?

Oh, it was a door.

Oh... I think we should...

take it out.
Can I take it out?

Uh-huh.

Oh, God...
Okay. Okay.

-Oh...
-Okay.

-Does it bleed a lot?
-Okay, it's out.

It's good. The head ones,
they bleed like crazy

and then they just stop.

Is it?

-Is it stopped?
-Mm-hmm.

-It is?
-See?

Is it?

Trust me, my father
bled to death.

We should clean it up.

It could still get infected.

You wanna come with me?

Okay.

Thank you.

We're nearly there.

Hi, Lloyd.

This is Beau.

Hello.

He was in an accident.

His mother just died,

and his father died
before he was born.

"When sorrows come,

"they come not single spies,
but in battalions."

Thank you.

This is me. Just a sec, Beau.

I have an extra sleeping bag
if you need one.

This way, Beau.

"Some Cupid kills
with arrows, some with traps."

<i>â™ª Fly, ladybug, fly</i>

<i>â™ª Up in the sky so high</i>

<i>â™ª I have no parents left</i>

<i>â™ª That's why I'm so bereft â™ª</i>

Damn these crossroads!

How can one stake one's life

on a choice between
two unmarked paths?

If one leads forward,

must the other go backwards?

If it were a trap?
Or this an opportunity?

Or might they
both lead home,

where I can take
my rightful seat,

and be lord
of my own possessions?

They're rehearsing
for the preview.

Damn these crossroads!

There, let's not spoil it.

As great trumpets speak,

our poor hero
realizes too late.

But these
are funeral horns!

Everyone!

This is Beau.

Hi, Beau!

He was in an accident

and both his parents are dead.

No!
Are you okay?

That's terrible.

What is this place?

We call ourselves
the Orphans of the Forest.

That's right!

Although many of our parents
simply abandoned us

without even bothering to die.

We're a traveling
theater company.

We go from forest to forest,

off the grid, making up homes
from whatever we find.

And then at
the end, we put on a big show!

I'm so sorry.

Aw.

See him?

That's Yesekov.

He's the man
who started all of this.

Papa...

It's time for the show!

Hi, there. Are you joining us?

What do you mean?

Do you want a costume?

-Oh...
-We like to, uh,

blur the line between
the audience and the players.

Either of these?

I like this color
with your eyes.

Or this one's fun...

Um...

-That one.
-That's my favorite too.

Let's get changed.

I'm happy
you're joining, Beau.

Hey there, brother,
I'm Duncan!

What brought you here?

<i>Jeeves! Rip him apart!</i>

<i>â™ª You can give your life,</i>
<i>you can lose your soul</i>

<i>â™ª You can bang your head</i>
<i>or you can drown in a hole</i>

<i>â™ª Nothing lasts forever, but...</i>

What am I doing here?

<i>â™ª Look around you</i>

<i>â™ª Everyone you see,</i>
<i>everyone you know...</i>

Please tell me,
what am I doing here?

<i>â™ª Shine â™ª</i>

No!

O God...

Fate has burned my house
to cinders

and launched me into exile.

I once thought I knew despair,
and that I could master it...

but now that I know this pain,

I can't fathom relief.

When I reach out for answers,

I grasp cold air.

O, with
my mother and father gone,

I have lost my whole self!

You grieve well.

Your parents are honored,

and now may rest
forever in peace.

Rise.

Now go forth.

Erect your own
glittering home...

and make it permanent.

Do I venture forth...

or stay here?

With what I know.

If I stay, I die.

No. I must go.

What? Chains!

Now you see.

They have always been there.

Yes. Push forward.

Pray that you learn valor
and be given luck.

<i>You will walk many miles.</i>

<i>Dozens will become hundreds,</i>

<i>hundreds</i>
<i>will become thousands.</i>

<i>You will pass through</i>
<i>countless villages.</i>

<i>But finally, one village</i>
<i>will speak to you,</i>

<i>some deep,</i>
<i>essential part of you</i>

<i>will recognize it,</i>

<i>and you will say,</i>
<i>"This village is mine."</i>

<i>You will learn a trade...</i>

<i>and eventually earn a living.</i>

<i>You will know the pleasure</i>
<i>of tasting fruit and bread</i>

<i>and wine that is yours...</i>

<i>...because you have earned it.</i>

<i>You will find a plot of land</i>

<i>and build a house</i>
<i>with your own hands.</i>

<i>You will cultivate the land.</i>

<i>You will live off it.</i>

<i>You will come</i>
<i>to make new friends.</i>

<i>One day,</i>
<i>you will meet a woman.</i>

<i>The story of your meeting</i>
<i>will change</i>

<i>according to who tells it:</i>

<i>that you were lost</i>

<i>and she helped you</i>
<i>find your way,</i>

<i>or that she was off course</i>

<i>and you guided her home.</i>

<i>She will see your fears,</i>

<i>and your pain, and your dreams,</i>

<i>and your potential...</i>

<i>and you will see hers.</i>

<i>In finding your other half,</i>

<i>the gifts of your life</i>
<i>will multiply.</i>

<i>Sometimes, she will look like</i>
<i>a man to you.</i>

<i>She will become pregnant</i>
<i>because you have sex with her.</i>

<i>You will have children.</i>
<i>Three sons.</i>

<i>You will teach them</i>
<i>what you know,</i>

<i>and you will tell them</i>
<i>you love them every day.</i>

<i>They will grow</i>
<i>into handsome boys,</i>

<i>blessed with courage</i>
<i>and kindness and ambition.</i>

<i>You will share your feelings</i>
<i>of pride with your therapist.</i>

<i>He will archive them.</i>

<i>One day, an historic storm</i>

<i>will sweep through</i>
<i>your village...</i>

<i>...and destroy your home.</i>

<i>You will be carried away...</i>

<i>...by a great flood.</i>

<i>You and your family</i>
<i>will be separated.</i>

<i>And you will be deposited</i>
<i>in a strange country.</i>

<i>You will look</i>
<i>for your family for days...</i>

<i>then weeks,</i>

<i>then months,</i>

<i>so many months that</i>
<i>you will come to lose count,</i>

<i>but you will not find them.</i>

<i>You will try to find work</i>

<i>to support</i>
<i>your continuing search,</i>

<i>but no one</i>
<i>will speak your language.</i>

<i>You will be treated</i>
<i>like a criminal.</i>

<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>you will come upon a village</i>

<i>wracked</i>
<i>by an inexplicable plague.</i>

<i>As you pass through,</i>
<i>a man, deranged by tragedy,</i>

<i>will identify you as the beast</i>
<i>who burned down his home</i>

<i>and replaced</i>
<i>his children's feet</i>

<i>with their hands.</i>

<i>You will try to argue</i>
<i>your innocence,</i>

<i>but this will only</i>
<i>make you sound more guilty.</i>

<i>You will wonder yourself</i>
<i>whether you are guilty.</i>

<i>You will flee.</i>

<i>Mad with vengeance,</i>

<i>they will send an attack dog</i>
<i>to pursue you.</i>

<i>It will tear through the world</i>
<i>to find you.</i>

<i>You won't know this,</i>
<i>but you will sense it.</i>

<i>And you will keep</i>
<i>a detailed record</i>

<i>of these impressions in a log.</i>

<i>And over time, this log</i>
<i>will become many logs.</i>

<i>Your adventures will continue</i>
<i>for years and years.</i>

<i>You will learn to distinguish</i>
<i>birds by their call</i>

<i>and you will know every tree</i>
<i>and plant by its name.</i>

<i>Abandoning all comforts,</i>

<i>you will condition your mind</i>
<i>to new ways of seeing.</i>

<i>You will experience</i>
<i>great highs and profound lows,</i>

<i>and you will look</i>
<i>for your family</i>

<i>until your life shrinks</i>
<i>and fades</i>

<i>into the dream of a ghost.</i>

<i>You will come to wonder</i>
<i>if they ever existed.</i>

<i>Finally, when you are</i>
<i>old and frail,</i>

<i>you will collapse</i>
<i>in exhaustion.</i>

Oh, sweetheart...

Why are you crying?

Because I've searched
for my family

all my life,

to the end of my life,

and I'm still alone.

You should not be crying
for your misfortunes,

for your own sins.

You also have been
searched for,

but you're so lost
in your own selfishness

that no one
could ever find you.

Confess.

Before your peers.

But what did I do?

You know.

Confess.

I've been a coward.

My whole life.

<i>You will confess everything.</i>

<i>After which,</i>
<i>you will find the earth</i>

<i>replaced by good water.</i>

<i>Sleep will come untroubled.</i>

<i>To the sound</i>
<i>of distant trumpets,</i>

<i>you will awake,</i>
<i>as if by a miracle,</i>

<i>at the foot</i>
<i>of your glittering village.</i>

<i>No one will recognize you,</i>

<i>but the smell of the air,</i>
<i>and the sounds of the insects,</i>

<i>and the way the evening light</i>

<i>slashes itself</i>
<i>across the chimney</i>

<i>of a neighbor's old house,</i>

<i>will unloose in you</i>
<i>a torrent of vivid memories.</i>

<i>You will be invited</i>
<i>to a special play</i>

<i>being put on</i>
<i>in an outdoor theater</i>

<i>just for that night.</i>

<i>Despite your hunger,</i>

<i>you will decide to spend</i>
<i>your last dollar on this.</i>

Over the last 40 years,
his memory had faltered

to the extent
that he couldn't remember

his own mother's face,

but just by breathing
in the air,

he was seized
by the absolute certainty

that this was his village.

Nobody remembered him,

and even though
all of his neighbors

had been replaced
by younger generations,

he recognized everything,

and somehow
he too felt recognized.

His home had waited for him,

just as loyally
as he had searched for it.

Even the sight
of the evening sun,

casting slashes of amber light
across a familiar chimney,

sent him reeling
into a flood of memories.

What did our father do next?

And where was the village?

We only saw it as boys
and have no memories!

Please,

-tell us how to find it.
-No, wait...

What did he do next?

He was delirious with hunger
and only had enough money

for one bowl of soup,
but before he could spend it,

he was invited
to a special play.

It was already in progress,

but he felt compelled
to go in,

so he spent his last dollar.

Not long after sitting in,

he saw that
the details of the plot

were impossibly similar
to those

of his own life,

and there were three young men
on the stage

who looked
remarkably like himself.

This is me!

And he rose up, at once
exhilarated and terrified

that it might not be true,
and he announced...

This is my story!

And the three young men
immediately recognized the man

as their father.

-Dad?
-No. It can't be.

My sons!

Dad...

Dad... Dad...

Oh, oh, oh...

Oh, my God.

-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

You're my boys!

Oh, my beautiful, sweet boys!

Don't be afraid. I'm here.
Come here.

Come here. Oh...

Oh, my... Oh, my God.

Oh...

Where... Where have you been?

You... You were ripped
from me.

I've looked for you
for so long... so long.

Oh...

Where did you go?

And how are you?

I made you. Oh, my loves.

Oh, my loves. Oh, my darlings.

Oh, my darlings.

I missed you so much.

Oh. Oh, that's okay.

It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.

Oh, my loves.

This the end of things.

It's okay.

What about our mother?
Is she...

-What?
-Is she...

She's not with you?

She's not with you?

Oh, God.
We were...

We were raised as orphans.

Oh, no!

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Where's Mom?

It's okay, my love.

It's okay.
Dad...

Mom...

Is there...

Is there any other family?

Besides us?

You had a grandmother.

Where is she?

Ah...

Her head.

And our grandfather?

How did he die?

He died
on our wedding night.

The same night
you were conceived.

He died the very instant
you were conceived.

How?

By finishing.

Into me.

He had a heart murmur,
just like you.

Did it hurt?

I'm sure it was excruciating.

It was the first time
we made love.

The first time either of us
made love, with anyone.

Your grandpa
and your great-grandpa

died the same way.

But he thought
he might be different.

I'm just as guilty.

I urged him on.

I wanted a normal life.

I wanted a child.

He died on top of me.

Inside.

I think about it,
I want to rip my ears off.

But then...

But then, that same trauma...

which changed me so utterly...

also resulted in
the greatest gift of my life.

I am so sorry for what
your daddy passed down to you.

I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

Is that a lie?

No.

Can...
Can that really happen?

Yes.

It's why I never...

with anyone.

Dad...

You've never been with anyone?

Then...
Then how... did you have us?

Ah...

What should I do?

Which limb shall I strike off?

You might act yesterday
and it would be decades tardy.

Have I not given
all I have?

All you have?

You have given trifles.

You have sacrificed
nothing real.

I have been pinned down
by my promises!

I am not
the master of my life!

Are you okay?

I am a mouse in a maze!
A maze?

I... I feel sick.

I know.

Try this.

It helps me.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Hello?

Can I help you?

Do you recognize me?

I don't know.

When you were little...

What?

How did you come here?

I was chased.

Your father is alive.

What?

I knew him.
After you were born.

I worked for your mom.

Not before I was born.
He died before...

Serving your dad food,
cleaning up after him.

My parents were in debt
to your mom.

What's that?

What?

Who... Who are you?

It doesn't matter, right?

-It does. It...
-No. It's just...

kidding. I...

I'm so happy to see you.

Are you him?

Wait.

Wait.

You okay, sweetheart?

Do my eyes deceive me?

What is this phantom I see?

Hello, fair stranger!

Ah, now you see,

out of the shadows...

Get me down right now!
Get me down from here!

Get me down!
Somebody help me!

Get me down from here!
Get me down!

I can't!
I'm tied up. Hurry!

Beau!

-Dad?
-Run!

Am I hurting you?

Okay, let's go. Clothes off.

Come on. Enough now.

What did I say?

Didn't I say I wasn't gonna do
this again with you tonight?

I'm about to feel hurt.

You're about
to really hurt me.

Where's Daddy?

Excuse me?

You know where Daddy is.

Daddy's dead.

Are you trying to hurt me?

I don't care! I want Daddy!

You want Daddy, too?

Come on. You want it your way,
let's go!

Up you go!

-I can't.
-Oh, but of course you can!

You're big enough
to hurt Mommy,

you're big enough for this!

-Nobody's allowed up there.
-Up!

Do you wanna go up, too?
No.

What is that? Are you nodding?

This is it!

We don't talk
about you anymore!

Get back in!

Excuse me, sir.

Is the funeral
already happening?

Already over.
There's a video inside.

<i>Mona.</i>

<i>Mona Wassermann.</i>

<i>We're gathered here today</i>
<i>as a community,</i>

<i>bound together</i>
<i>by our love for Mona,</i>

<i>and by a feeling of duty.</i>

<i>The duty to mourn</i>
<i>Mona's passing,</i>

<i>but also to celebrate</i>
<i>Mona's life.</i>

<i>Mona, who was</i>
<i>petrified of squirrels.</i>

<i>Mona, who single-handedly</i>
<i>built a super-business</i>

<i>beyond her wildest dreams.</i>

<i>Mona, who was</i>
<i>an endlessly dedicated wife</i>

<i>to her adoring husband,</i>

<i>who passed away tragically</i>

<i>just as their life together</i>
<i>was blossoming.</i>

<i>And Mona,</i>
<i>who was a devoted mother</i>

<i>to her sole surviving son,</i>
<i>Beau,</i>

<i>whom she loved so deeply,</i>

<i>and who has elected not to</i>
<i>be present with us today.</i>

<i>Mona loved Beau with a love</i>
<i>that could move mountains.</i>

<i>In fact, I suggest</i>
<i>when we leave,</i>

<i>we check on the mountains</i>
<i>to make sure they're okay.</i>

<i>What can you say?</i>

<i>I hope she knows that.</i>

<i>I wish I could tell her that.</i>

<i>That I... I did, I loved her.</i>

<i>And it's in accordance</i>
<i>with her last wishes</i>

<i>that we now play this song.</i>

<i>Her favorite song.</i>

<i>â™ª You sheltered me from harm</i>

<i>â™ª Kept me warm, kept me warm</i>

<i>â™ª You gave my life to me</i>

<i>â™ª Set me free, set me free</i>

<i>â™ª The finest years I ever knew</i>

<i>â™ª Were all the years</i>
<i>I had with you</i>

<i>â™ª And I would give</i>
<i>anything I own</i>

<i>â™ª Would give up my life,</i>
<i>my heart, my home</i>

<i>â™ª I would give</i>
<i>everything I own</i>

<i>â™ª Just to have you back again</i>

<i>â™ª You taught me how to love</i>

<i>â™ª What it's of, what it's of</i>

<i>â™ª You never said too much</i>
<i>But still you showed the way</i>

<i>â™ª And I knew from watching you</i>

<i>â™ª Nobody else could ever know</i>

<i>â™ª The part of me</i>
<i>that can't let go</i>

<i>â™ª And I would give</i>
<i>anything I own</i>

<i>â™ª Would give up my life,</i>
<i>my heart, my home</i>

<i>â™ª I would give</i>
<i>everything I own</i>

<i>â™ª Just to have you back again</i>

<i>â™ª Is there someone you know</i>

<i>â™ª You're loving them so</i>

<i>â™ª But taking them all</i>
<i>for granted?</i>

<i>â™ª You may lose them one day</i>

<i>â™ª Someone takes them away</i>

<i>â™ª And they don't hear</i>
<i>the words you long to say</i>

<i>â™ª I would give anything I own</i>

<i>â™ª Would give up my life,</i>
<i>my heart, my home</i>

<i>â™ª I would give everything I own</i>

<i>â™ª Just to have you back again</i>

<i>â™ª Just to touch you once again â™ª</i>

Hello?

Hello!

Yoo-hoo!

Hello?

Hello?

Hi.

Uh, I'm sorry.

I thought it started at 8 p.m.

Okay, um, I brought flowers.

I'll just leave them here,
I guess.

She also owes me money.

This certainly isn't the time,

and you're probably
not the person...

Okay, um...

I'll be leaving, then. I just
need to call another Uber.

I can wait for it...

I'm sorry again.

Elaine?

It's me.

It's Beau.

Oh, my God.

Beau?

No.

Uh, it can't be.

I can't believe it's you.

Oh, my God!

I mean, of course it's you.
This is your mom.

I'm so sorry.

For your loss.

What are you doing here?

I'm just trying to, you know,
uh, pay my respects. And...

I guess to give you
my condolences.

Since you're actually here.
I'm...

so sorry.

I can't believe it's you.

I can't believe it's you.

Do I look different?

You recognized me.

I'm old now.

You're the same.

No, I'm not.

You are.

Well, you're the same, too.

Except for your body
and your face.

You worked for her?

What do you mean?

Well, I did until last week.

I was actually just drowning
my sorrows before I came.

My breath's like pure wine.

"Until last week"?

I'm sorry for your loss.

I waited for you.

What do you mean?

Why?

You told me to.

I even have it in writing.

I wanted you to.

Baby, baby, baby...

Do you want to go inside?

Do you want me to leave?

Let's go inside.

Bedroom, where?

The dragon's lair!

Got any candles...?

Why don't you go
to the bathroom?

When you come back,
I'll be ready.

-You didn't get undressed.
-Yup.

Hi. Hi, sorry. Hi.

Huh. Mm.

-You okay?
-Yeah.

Are y... Are you?

You're so tense.

-Oh... I'm sorry.
-Relax.

Okay. It's just because,
you know,

it's been, like,
kind of awhile.

Yeah, me too.

I like that
you're not all macho.

Thank you.

Take these off.

Okay, what I meant was that

it's been
really kind of a while.

Well, it hasn't affected
your virility.

-What?
-You're crazy hard.

Really?

Oh...

Oh, my God.

-Is it... Is it on?
-Yeah.

You sure the condom
is on all the way?

Yeah?

Oh, my God.

Are you really in?
You feel so good.

Oh, no.

Oh, no!

Wait...

-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah...

But wait.

-I...
-Let's start it over.

What?

-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah.

Wait a second.

I... I... I can't...

I think it's gonna happen.

Wait! You gotta wait a second.

Stop! Oh, stop! Stop!

Stop! Ahh! Oh! Oh, no!

Oh, my! My God.

God.

Oh...

I really felt that.

Oh, God, that was a lot.

You just blasted
through that bag.

Oh, my God.

Oh, yeah.

I want to come too.

-I...
-Hold on.

Hold on. Hold on.

-Uh...
-Don't move.

Don't move.

Don't move. Okay?

Oh, my God!

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, my God.

I really thought
I was going to die.

My whole life.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, thank you. Thank you.

Thank you.

No, please.
Continue as if I wasn't here.

What would be next?

No?

You don't look especially
overjoyed to see me, honey.

I was dead just a minute ago.
This is a miracle.

Get rid of this. Feed Harry.

She worked for you?

I sincerely doubt that,
sweetheart,

but if you're right, you can
let her know she's fired.

For how long?

How many years from...
from the beginning? From...

How is your head feeling?

It looks like you really
banged up your face.

You could have a concussion.

You don't feel disoriented?

You know where you are?

I'm in my house.

Actually, you're in my house,
sweetheart.

And my house is your house,
which it always will be.

But if you know where you are,

then you must also know
where you just were.

And where you just did
what you just did,

which I saw every second of.

You didn't just wake up
suddenly and you were there.

You didn't just
get dropped in,

out of the blue,
to your surprise,

your deceased mother's room,

only days after
what you believed

-was her death!
-I didn't.

You didn't just
get deposited there

-by accident!
-I didn't mean it.

-Yes, I know you didn't.
-No. I knew you weren't dead.

I saw with my own eyes

exactly what you knew
and what you didn't know.

You saw my body.

I saw the birthmark, Mom.

I know those were
Martha's hands.

That's right.

-Goodnight, baby.
-Goodnight, Martha.

And if I hear any noise,
I'll break back in

and I'll tickle you to death!

It's...

What...

How...

How you even...

Ki... H...

How can you do that to her?

"Do that to her"?

Baby, I would never
do anything

to the loyal
and devoted housekeeper

who gave me 37 years
of unconditional service.

She volunteered.

-No, she didn't.
-Yes.

-No, she didn't!
-She did.

No, she didn't!

I couldn't restrain her
from volunteering.

For how much?

Enough that every member
of her extended family

quit their job
on the same day,

and won't ever need
to work again.

And you know something else?

It was worth every penny.

Because now I know.

-What do you know?
-Everything.

You don't know anything.

Oh, do you think so, Beau?

Do you really think so?

Do you also think
I didn't know

when you called
to give me the big bad news

about your fictitious keys

being stolen
from your imaginary door?

-My key... they were stolen.
-You think a mother

can even help but see through
her son's blatant lies

and falsehoods
and endless schemes?

You think
this is any different

<i>from the time you gave me the</i>
<i>exact same CD for my birthday</i>

<i>that you gave me</i>
<i>the year before</i>

<i>and which you also gave your</i>
<i>fucking high-school counselor?</i>

Or when you bought me
that kitchen set

the very week after
I publicly swore off cooking!

Even when you were a baby,

you rejected me
and refused to breastfeed,

while every other smug cunt
on the street

had happy, docile babies
sucking their tits dry!

Do you think
I hear the absurd story

of you missing your flight and
that I don't absolutely know,

that I have any hint
of a doubt,

that you never,
from the very start,

intended to make that flight?

The true surprise, the shock,

would have been
you actually coming!

Now, that would
have spun my head like a top!

I wouldn't have known
what to do!

I'd have thrown myself
flopping on the floor,

begging God's forgiveness
for ever having doubted you,

but still I would have been
struck stupid with disbelief!

What, you walking away?

Where you going?

What's behind the door, Beau?

Where on earth
are you gonna go?

You've always acted like some
dutiful, doting little boy,

as if it's throwing me
off some scent.

None of it's ever been real.

You spent your whole life
going around,

asking every half-wit
you could find,

"If I do this,
can I avoid this,

"or will that happen?"

As if you were born without
the mechanism to choose.

You let it all resolve itself
in the absence of you!

You make everyone
do it for you!

You think
that makes you innocent?

My own mother
wouldn't even touch me.

Not if it was simply to
stamp me out if I was on fire!

I wasn't worthy of her love.

I hadn't earned it!
And I never earned it.

No matter what I did,

no matter how much
of my deepest real self

I denied and buried,

and smothered
until it was dead.

None of it mattered.

She blamed me for everything
her mother did to her.

When I had you,

I promised,
"I will never do that to him.

"I will give him
all the love I have."

You know what I tell people

when they ask me
how my son is doing?

I say, "Your guess
is as good as mine."

How I wish that were true.

<i>Tell</i>
<i>me more about that period.</i>

<i>Well...</i>

<i>When I was just starting</i>
<i>to like my own stuff</i>

<i>and do my own things,</i>

<i>she'd take all those changes</i>
<i>very personally,</i>

<i>and get very mad or sad</i>

<i>and make me feel bad</i>
<i>about it until I stopped.</i>

<i>So, through</i>
<i>the weaning process,</i>

<i>she took your displays</i>
<i>of autonomy</i>

<i>as a betrayal.</i>

<i>Exactly.</i>

<i>What do you mean?</i>

<i>Can you</i>
<i>give me an example?</i>

<i>Well, like, she would</i>
<i>give me lots of love...</i>

Oh, I gave you lots of love!
I'm sorry!

...b <i>ut if I didn't</i>
<i>give it back to her</i>

<i>in the exact same way,</i>

<i>she saw it as</i>
<i>me being not thankful</i>

<i>and, like, trying to hurt her.</i>

<i>So the love</i>
<i>was conditional?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Ah. This is</i>
<i>very good for you, Beau.</i>

Over 300 sessions,

and that was about as
flattering to me as they get.

Which one was my favorite,
Jeremy?

October 3, 2018.

How could you do...

How could you...

How could you do this to me?

<i>I've been</i>
<i>having it since I was little.</i>

<i>Where I'm a little boy,</i>

<i>probably the same age</i> as <i>when</i>
<i>I started having the dream...</i>

<i>and there's another me,</i>
<i>who's identical,</i>

<i>but he's braver,</i>

<i>and he asks her</i>
<i>about my father</i>

<i>because I'm too scared.</i>

<i>And then she sends him away</i>
<i>and locks him up. Upstairs.</i>

<i>And she never</i>
<i>talks about him again.</i>

<i>What is it you want</i>
<i>to know about your father?</i>

<i>If you weren't afraid, if</i>
<i>there were no consequences...</i>

I want to know the truth.
<i>- ...what would you</i>

<i>ask your mom?</i>

<i>I'd ask her...</i>

To tell me the truth!
<i>- I don't know...</i>

<i>Do you feel</i>
<i>she didn't tell you the truth?</i>

Yes!
<i>- Um...</i>

<i>-I don't know.</i>
-Yes!

'Cause I...
<i>- But I think</i>

<i>I'm too afraid to believe it.</i>
-I know now.

I know the truth. I...

I met my father. I met the man
in the woods, and I know.

Why did you lie to me?

Do you want the truth now?

Yes!

Follow me.

Up there?
That's right.

Nobody's allowed
up there.

Some things are
for your protection, Beau,

and I want you to remember
that I kept this from you!

I don't wanna
go up there now.

-I don't wanna...
-No,

you want the truth,
and I think you deserve it.

Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll be right behind you.

No. I don't wanna
go up there, Mom.

I'll be right behind you.
Don't worry.

Up you go.

Don't worry,
I'll be right behind you.

Don't worry, sweetheart.
Up you go.

-This is just like my dream.
-I'm right behind you.

-I'm right behind you.
-Oh... Oh, God.

Oh...

Oh, this is exactly
like my dream!

Don't you get it,
you stupid idiot?

That wasn't a dream,
that was a memory!

Wait! Wait! Wait!

Mommy, wait!

Oh... Oh... No.

Come on...

No...

Beau?

My beautiful boy.

Oh, Beau, don't be afraid.

No!

Oh, God. Oh, baby.

Baby, sweetheart.

Ooh, sweetheart.

I didn't want you to know.

Do you see now why I lied?

Beau.

Beau!

That was your father.

Oh, Mom! Oh, Mom!

I'm so sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I know I've been a bad son.
I'll be a good son.

Please! I'm sorry.

I'll do anything
to make it up to you.

I'll make it up to you.

Please, please. Please!

Please, I'm sorry.

You selfish little boy!

I'm sorry...
What are you crying about?

Do you have any idea
what I had to go through

to bring you into this world?

Stand up!

You cry now?

You need a mother now?

Ever since you clawed
your way out of me,

I've had to dig down deep
to my very bottom

and squeeze
the love out of myself,

but still I gave it to you.

I've given you
my whole fucking life!

Which you took,
and you took, and you took,

and I squeezed myself empty!

I gave you everything!

And what do I get back?
What do I have?

Insults! And empty promises!

You promised to never hurt me.
Do you even remember that one?

You promised it
a hundred fucking times!

You swore on your own life!

But your promises
are nothing but shit!

I've been ground down
to nothing

by love and panic and worry.

Is my baby hungry?
Is he healthy?

Is he scared enough?
Of the world?

And the fruit
of all this anguish?

Is grief!

And hatred!

Yes. Yes.

Hatred. I do.

I do!

I hate...

Mommy?

Are you okay? You...

You can breathe.
Can you breathe?

Can you breathe?

I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

Are you okay? Are you okay?

<i>Beau Isaac Wassermann.</i>

<i>Born May 10th, 1975.</i>

Proceed.

We are gathered now
to assess the extent...

of the subject's guilt.

To begin with, a seemingly
innocuous tradition.

Every Monday before
his weekly appointment

to scapegoat his mother,

the subject would visit his
local pond to feed the ducks.

Just as he never missed
an opportunity

to feed his therapist's fish.

Very nice.

Very nice.

But what happens

when he meets a human beggar
that very night?

Now, one can see

that the subject
will go out of his way

to feed a bird or fish,

but not to support

a suffering member
of his own species.

Objection!

Violent street crimes
were everywhere on the news

and everyone was advised
to avoid strangers!

This is nothing new!

The subject
has thoughts every day

around relieving the suffering
of those less fortunate!

By all indications,

he has a healthy,
functioning conscience!

He just chose to ignore it!

Consider
the following episode.

Day 49 of his ninth year.

He goes shopping
with his mother.

At one point, she lost him,

or so she thought.

Fearing the worst, she panics.

She searches the building.

She cries out for the boy,
who was in fact

hiding behind a corner,

watching the whole thing.

My client was genuinely lost.

It was upon
finding his mother,

seeing her frantic state,
that he hesitated

for fear of punishment!

It was
in this frantic state of mind

that his mother
tripped and fell,

tearing ligaments in her knee
and badly harming her ankle.

And still

the subject did not intervene!

He was afraid!

Consider now
the subject at age 15,

day 210,

finding himself in the rare
company of other boys.

The subject, hoping to impress
his horrendous new friends,

invites them into his home,

while his mother
is out buying him...

...gifts for his birthday.

He lets them
into her private bathroom,

and allows them to rifle
through her dirty laundry,

and inspect and ultimately
steal her undergarments.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

They pressured me!
They pressured me!

They pressured him!

What? What are you doing?

What?
No. No!

No!

Oh, my God! Oh, God!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Even his supposed acts
of thoughtfulness

are emblematic
of a greater hypocrisy.

Take this very week.

The subject asked Grace
and Roger to drive him home

so that he might
bury his mother

and commence proper mourning.

Roger offered the option

of driving home tonight

if the offer
of driving tomorrow

wasn't soon enough.

And Beau chose
to drive home tomorrow,

further postponing a trip

that had already been
outrageously delayed!

And if one examines
the expression on his face

when Roger made
this challenge,

one can only conclude

that the subject was panicked
at the idea of returning home.

I didn't want to put him out!

I... He had surgeries!

I cried!
When I was beside the coffin!

When I was told the news!

I... I... I cried for hours!

Continuing
to bear this in mind,

I ask you
to consider yesterday.

Not three hours after meeting
a knocked up dimwit

who made clumsy eyes at him,

did he gift her
with a tributary gift

intended for no one less than
his recently deceased mother.

Now, when the pregnant slut

offered to return
the special gift,

did he insist that
this total stranger keep...

Oh!

No! No! Wait!

Wait! Stop!

Wait!

My legs! My legs are stuck!

What! Wait!

Wait, Mom! My legs!
My legs, I can't Move!

What?

Mommy, please!

Please help me! Please!

Please help me out! Please!

Please! Please don't fault me!

Help! Help me!

Somebody help me, please!

Help! Help!

Help me, please!

Help! Please!

Please! I don't want to die!
I don't want to...

No! My baby! No!

My baby.

My baby.

My baby.

My baby.
