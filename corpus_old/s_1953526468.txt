SMELLS LIKE LAVENDER.


[cell phone
playing jingle]


UGH.

[jingle continues]



HELLO, IT'S--
IT'S FRED.

WHAT'S GOING ON,
MULBERRY?

OH, HI.
MR. PHILBROOK.

HI. OH, YOU CALLED
AT A PERFECT TIME.

STOP TALKING, FRED.
JUST...[chuckles]

ARE YOU GOING TO THE FITZPATRICK
TODAY OR NOT?

TODAY?

OH, I--
YES, TODAY.

I NEED YOU TO HEAD OUT
TO THE FITZPATRICK

TO SIGN
SOME VERY IMPORTANT PAPERS.

IS THERE--
IS MY--

YOU REMEMBER
MY LOVELY WIFE LORNA.

SHE'S GOT A BIG DAY TODAY,
AND IT'S, UH--

SHE'S STARTING
HER OWN BUSINESS,

AND IT'S HER FIRST DAY.

SHE'S GOT A BIG ORDER.

FRED, YOU'RE GOING
TO THE FITZPATRICK.

THERE ARE
NO OTHER OPTIONS.

THE PAPERS WILL BE
AT THE FRONT DESK.

AHH! NO! NO.

GOOD MORNING.
HEY, BUDDY, HOW ARE YOU?

GOOD.
HI. HI, HONEY.

HI.
WHAT'S UP WITH THE SUIT?

UM...UH...

I THOUGHT THAT IT
IS A BEAUTIFUL MORNING,

WE'RE PACKING 20 CASES
OF STARVALICIOUS BARS.

ROSE, FREDDIE, FINISH UP.
GET YOUR HOMEWORK.

WE'RE LEAVING
IN FIVE MINUTES.

I'M NOT DONE EATING,
AND I'M STARVING.

I'M DONE--THESE EGGS
SMELL LIKE CHICKEN BUTT.

HEY, THAT'S MOM'S FOOD.
KIND OF LIKE YOU.

THIS IS GONNA BE A BIG DAY
FOR YOUR MOM.

BIG DAY.

HONEY, I HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE
VERY QUICKLY,

LIKE, FOR FIVE MINUTES,
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
NO.

YOU SAID YOU WOULD HELP.
NOW--

NOW, PLEASE HELP.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

PHILBROOK CALLED, LIKE,
LITERALLY A MINUTE AGO,

AND, UH, HE WANTS ME
TO JUST GO BY SOMEWHERE

AND SIGN SOMETHING
VERY QUICKLY.

WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST HAVE LISA RUN THEM BY.

I KNOW, RIGHT?
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

I CAN'T.
IT'S THE MENTAL INSTITUTION.

THE FITZPATRICK.
WHAT?

YEAH, SO--
THE CRAZY HOUSE,

HALFWAY, OKAY.
TWO HOURS, YEAH.

NO, NO.
I'M COMING RIGHT BACK.

HE'S, LIKE, FIVE--
HE'S, LIKE, INCHES AWAY

FROM BECOMING GOVERNOR.

YOU KNOW THAT,
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

THIS FAMILY'S TURNING AROUND.

LIKE, WE'RE GOING UPTOWN.

COULD YOU BUY ME
AN ANT FARM?

I'M--SHH. QUIET.
WE'RE NOT BUYING YOU ANYTHING.

OKAY.
THIS IS JUST SO IMPORTANT.

TAKE THE KIDS WITH YOU,
DROP THEM OFF AT SCHOOL,

IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD DO THAT
WITHOUT THE KID PART?

OKAY, LET'S GO.

I CALL SHOTGUN!
YOU DON'T GET SHOTGUN.

YOU'RE YOUNGER.
NOT IF I GET THERE FIRST.

UH-UH, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET THERE FIRST, THOUGH!

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING WHEN YOUR MOUTH IS FULL.

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

[phone ringing]

THIS IS GREENE.

OH, HELLO, MR. PHILBROOK.

HOW'S THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
GOING?

CUT THE CRAP, GREENE.

NOW, LISTEN, DR. MULBERRY'S
ON HIS WAY OVER AS WE SPEAK.

JUST HAVE THE PAPERS MARKED,
WAITING AT THE FRONT DESK.

UH, SHOULD I MEET HIM
AND EXPLAIN?

THE LESS HE KNOWS,
THE BETTER.

[sighs]

WHY DO YOU HAVE A BAG
HANGING IN YOUR CAR?

CAN I JUST TAKE IT DOWN?
MM, SWEETIE, NO.

I'D RATHER YOU NOT, OKAY?

AND IT'S THERE FOR...

PREPARATIONAL REASONS.

IF YOU'RE AT A PLACE
IN YOUR LIFE...

WHERE YOU JUST WANT TO--
[screams] OH, MY GOSH.

WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH, THAT'S...

[frog croaks]
YOU KNOW, VOL--LET'S--

WE CAN REACT
WITHOUT THE VOLUME.

WHAT IS--
LEAVE IT ALONE.

IT'S MY SCIENCE PROJECT.
IT'S DISGUSTING!

WHAT IS IT?
SO'S YOUR FACE.

OKAY, HEY. HEY!
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING THERE.

ALL RIGHT?
DON'T MAKE ME BE OFFICER.

OFFICER OF WHAT?
OF...THE SIT--THAT--

THE SITUATION
THAT JUST HAPPENED.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

[whispers]
STUPID.

[sighs]

HEY, COLIN,
ROSE IS HERE.

SHUT UP!
OH, MY GOD, I HATE YOU.

YOU RUIN MY LIFE.

HEY, DR. MULBERRY.

WHAT?

I'M STARTING
TO PLAY FOOTBALL NOW.

I DON'T THINK
THAT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.

OH, MY GOD, DAD.
YOU ARE SO RUDE.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DATE

THE FIRST PERSON
THAT TALKS TO YOU.

YOU DESERVE--
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

OH, AND YOU DESERVE
TO SLEEP IN THE GUEST HOUSE.

OH, WAIT,
YOU ALREADY DO.

MY DAUGHTER--MY DAUGHTER
JUST SAID THAT TO ME!

MY DAUGHTER...
SAID THAT TO ME.

MY DAUGHTER
JUST SAID THAT TO ME.

THAT WAS SO RUDE.
MY DAUGHTER.

[knock at door]
ENTER.

SO I NEED TO START PROCESSING
DOLORES'S RELEASE.

SHE'S NOT BEING RELEASED.

SIR, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THIS.

BUT DOLORES TURNS 18 TODAY,

AND HER FATHER CAN'T
STORE HER HERE ANY LONGER.

NO RELEASE.

TO SIGN SOME PAPERS
TO KEEP HER HERE.

WITH ALL DUE RESPECT--

I APPRECIATE
THE RESPECT,

BUT THE FEELING'S
NOT MUTUAL RIGHT NOW.

DOLORES IS A DANGER
TO HERSELF

AND EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THIS INSTITUTION.

SHE'S STAYING PUT.

BUT, SIR,
WE CAN'T KEEP HER HERE.

"WE" AREN'T KEEPING HER HERE.
I'M KEEPING HER HERE.

DROP THIS FOLDER
ON YOUR WAY OUT, PLEASE.

[electronic humming]

[breathless]
NURSE NANCY.

IT'S--IT'S TEDDY.
I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

I'VE LOOKED
IN THE REC ROOM,

IN--IN THE CAFETERIA,
IN THE GYM.

WELL, HERE COMES DOLORES.
I'M SURE SHE KNOWS.

HEY.
WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

YEAH.
THAT IS SO PRETTY, DOLORES.

TEDDY MADE IT FOR ME
AS A GOING-AWAY PRESENT.

BUT, UM, ARE THOSE
MY RELEASE PAPERS?

NO, BUT MR. GREENE
IS HANDLING THAT.

HAVE YOU SEEN TEDDY
THIS MORNING?

UM...SURE HAVEN'T.

BUT WITH FAMILY DAY
AND ME LEAVING,

HE'S PROBABLY
A LITTLE FRAZZLED.

SHOULD I GO ASK MR. GREENE
FOR MY PAPERS?

THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

I'M SURE HE'LL COME TO YOU
WHEN THEY'RE READY.

OKAY, WELL, UM,

I'M GONNA MISS YOU,
BIG JOHN.

HEY.
AND...

I'M GONNA MISS YOU TOO,
NANCY.

YOU'RE TOUGH, BUT YOU'VE
ALWAYS BEEN HONEST TO ME.

THANKS, DOLORES.
IT MEANS A LOT.

WELL, UH, SEE YA.

WOULDN'T WANNA BE YA.

[classical music playing]

â™ª

[music shuts off]

[cell phone
playing jingle]

[clears throat]
HELLO.

I NEED YOU TO STOP OFF
AND GET SOME GROCERIES,

SO WRITE THIS DOWN
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL FORGET.

OKAY, YEAH, WELL,
I'LL JUST WRITE IT DOWN.

10 POUNDS OF ORGANIC,
FAT-FREE VEGETABLE SPREAD...

OKAY...
AND 30 POUNDS OF RAW OATS.

OF COURSE!

I NEED 20 POUNDS
OF ORGANIC ALMONDS.

OKAY.

â™ª HERE AGAIN SOMEDAY

â™ª THE MORE I MISS YOU,

[coughs]
OW!

OH, COME ON!

OH, MY GOD.

[indistinct chatter on TV]

[coughs]

WELL, THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP,
RICHARD.

I FOUND TEDDY.

PERHAPS NEXT TIME,
YOU CAN LET ME KNOW

WHEN YOU LET A PATIENT
WALK UP OUT OF HERE

AND DRIVE OFF
ON A TRACTOR.

TO THE PHILBROOKS,
FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING.

I GO TO THE SAME CHURCH,

ROOT FOR THE SAME
FOOTBALL TEAM,

AND KISS THE SAME WOMAN
EACH NIGHT BEFORE PRAYERS.

THANK YOU.

LET'S GO, TEDDY.

MY NAME IS PHINEAS PHILBROOK.
LET'S GO.

AND I WANT TO BE
THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF OKLAHOMA.

GOOD, AND I'M ASSUMING
HE PAID?

GOOD. OH, HANG ON
JUST A SECOND.

CAN I HELP YOU?
OH, GOD.

I'M DR. MULBERRY.
I'M HERE TO SIGN SOME PAPERS.

OH, UM, YEAH.

[coughs loudly]

AGH!

YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

YEAH, I'M HERE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

OKAY, SO TELL ME ABOUT IT.

YEAH, JUST A SECOND.
[sniffles]

YES, I WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT IT.

OF COURSE.

SO YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
WITH HIM AGAIN? THANKS.

OH.
THANK YOU.

SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

DO YOU THINK I COULD DRY OFF
WITH A TOWEL OR...

ANYTHING LAYING AROUND
OR SOMETHING?

UM, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK,
IS IT?

PROBABLY NOT, I WAS JUST
GONNA SAY PROBABLY NOT.

UM...

SORRY, DO YOU HAVE, LIKE,
A BATHROOM OR...

I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST A TEMP.

UM, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
RIGHT DOWN THERE,

THERE'S A WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM.

SO MAYBE
THERE'S A MEN'S TOO?

HANG ON A SECOND.
I HAVE TO BUZZ YOU IN, SO...

YOU'RE SO KIND.

YEAH, THIS PLACE
IS KIND OF BIZARRE.


[shower running]

[children chattering]

LOOK, I KNOW FAMILY DAYS
ARE HARD FOR YOU,

BUT YOU GOT A FAMILY,
TEDDY.

EVERYBODY HERE IS A PART
OF YOUR FAMILY.

I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

I KNOW.
WE'LL DO IT IN A MINUTE.

I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

OHH,
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

I KNOW.
COME ON, WE'RE COMING.

STOP THAT.
HAVE YOU SEEN DOLORES?

'CAUSE I NEED TO TELL HER
THE NEWS.

NO.
I DID.

NATHAN AND I WENT
ON THE ONLINE MACHINE

'CAUSE SHE'S SO HAPPY
TO GET OUT,

AND WE WENT
TO GO FIND HER FATHER.

LOOK, HER FATHER
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE ONLINE MACHINE?

MR. GREENE,
ALL THE PATIENTS--

LOOK, I'M NOT EVEN
TALKING TO YOU.

WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR HER FATHER?

I GOTTA GO.

I GOTTA GO NOW.
OKAY, YOU CAN GO IN A MINUTE.

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU NUT CASE.

YOU STAY AWAY FROM DOLORES.
YOU GOT ME?

MR. GREENE.

I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM SO BAD.

THERE'S A LOCKER ROOM
RIGHT OVER THERE.

I HAVE TO GO.
YOU GOT TWO MINUTES.

OUCH.

[shower running]




OKAY, TEDDY,
YOU GOT YOUR TWO MINUTES.

YOUR TIME IS UP!

[water running]

ALL RIGHT, TEDDY,
I'M COMIN' IN!

[grunts]

TEDDY?

GET OUT!
I WANT YOU OUT THIS INSTANT!

DO YOU MIND?
NOW! OUT!

WHAT THE--
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

NOW!

WAIT, YOU CAN'T JUST
WALK IN HERE.

WHERE IS MY PHONE?
WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES?

I WANT YOU DRESSED
IMMEDIATELY!

THESE ARE NOT
MY CLOTHES,

AND YOUR TONE
IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

I DEMAND TO SPEAK
TO YOUR SUPERIOR AT ONCE.

I AM THE SUPERIOR.
NOW GET DRESSED!

OH, I AM SORRY,

BUT YOUR AUDACITY
NEEDS TO BE LEASHED!

I AM ALREADY PAST
THE LEVEL OF OUTRAGE!

ORDERLIES,
LOCKER ROOM, NOW!

DO NOT TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M SOME PETITE,

ADOLESCENT SHEEP DOG!
I AM A DOCTOR!

I DEMAND TO SEE
MY PERSONAL ITEMS AT ONCE.

WHAT DO YOU NEED?

WELL, TEDDY'S DECIDED
TO PULL ONE OVER ON US.

PROBABLY THE STRESS.
TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS ROOM.

JOHN, YOU STAY
OUTSIDE HIS DOOR

UNTIL WE GET HIM
SETTLED DOWN.

LET'S GO, TEDDY.

NO, I--NO.
NO, NO, NO!

NO! NO!

LET GO OF ME,
YOU INCOMPETENT BEASTS!

NO, NO!
CALM DOWN, TEDDY.

NO! IT'S PREPOSTEROUS!
CALM DOWN.

I AM BESIDE MYSELF!
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
NO!

YOU ARE A ROACH!
TEDDY, CALM DOWN!

STUPID OAF.

THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

NO! NO!

YOU AREN'T EVEN LISTENING
OR PAYING ATTENTION, YOU...

[shouting continues
indistinctly]

SO, WAIT, IF YOU MET HIM
AT YOUR BROTHER'S WEDDING,

HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S NOT, LIKE,
A COUSIN OR SOMETHING?

YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

SO WAIT, IS THIS--

IS THIS THE PILOT,
OR IS THIS THE PLAYWRIGHT?

[grunts softly]

THE BARTENDER?
HMM.

DAD THERE
AND YOUR GRANDMA AND STUFF?

I DON'T KNOW.

MAYBE, LIKE, FOUR.

YEAH.

WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN ON TUESDAY,

BUT I'M NOT SURE.
HE DOESN'T MAKE VERY GOOD MONEY.

DEADBEAT.

OH, MY GOD.

UH, HANG ON.

EXCUSE ME.

YES?
FIND EVERYTHING OKAY?

YE-YES.

THANK YOU.


I DON'T KNOW.
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

HMM.

PEOPLE HERE
ARE WEIRD.

YEAH, PROBABLY NOT,
THOUGH.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

YEAH, I CAN MEET YOU THERE,
THEN.

[door squeaks]

NO! OWW, MY--
OW!

MY ARM HAIR!
MY--ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?

DO YOU EVEN KNOW THE LEVEL
OF EMBARRASSMENT

YOU'RE DIGGING FOR YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW?

SHUT IT!
THAT'S IT.

[muffled]
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

BUT 20 MINUTES AGO,
YOU WERE THE GROUNDSKEEPER.

AND LAST WEEK,
YOU WERE A SALESMAN.

NOW, WE HAVE SUPPORTED
ALL OF YOUR CAREER ADVENTURES,

BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

YOU WILL NOT TREAT US
WITH DISRESPECT!

SO I SUGGEST YOU MIND
YOUR MANNERS, TEDDY,

OR ELSE THIS WILL BE
YOUR LAST ADVENTURE.

TAKE HIM TO HIS ROOM.

GOD!
HOW COULD YOU LIE TO ME?

DOLORES, CALM DOWN.
NO! YOU'RE A LIAR!

YOU LIED TO ME
THE WHOLE TIME!

WHAT IS THIS, A ZOO?
I'M SICK OF THIS PLACE!

YOU'RE A LIAR!
NO, NO!

CALM DOWN.
YOU STUPID ANIMAL TRAINER!

[William Tell Overture playing]


[horn honks]

OH!


AH, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS--

I'M SORRY,
THERE'S NO LISTING

FOR "WHAT'S THE GEL?"

WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
ANOTHER DESTINATION?

HOME!

THANK YOU.
PROCEED TO TURN LEFT

AND HEAD SOUTH
ON HIGHWAY 131.

[gasps]

GO, GO, GO, GO!

AAH! AAH!

NO!
[pounding on door]

NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO!

NO, OPEN THE DOOR.
OPEN THE DOOR THIS--

WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S THAT?

YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!
LISTEN TO MY MOUTH!

CAN YOU HEAR?
CAN'T YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

OPEN THIS DOOR!
OW!

OW! GOD.

AGH! OH!

AGH!

HELLO, TEDDY!
WELCOME BACK.

[whimpers]

OH.
BOOKS.

UH, MY NAME'S NOT TED.
IT'S FRED.

UH...

THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

I KNEW A FRED ONCE.

FRED HENRY,
WORLD WAR II.

BAD TIMES.
BAD TIMES.

RIGHT.

POOR BOY, HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH A NURSE,

BUT IT COULD NEVER WORK OUT.

OH, PSH.

YOU MEAN THIS FRED?

IS THIS THE FRED
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

OH, DON'T BE
A SILLY GOOSE.

THAT'S A CHARACTER
IN A BOOK.

ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT,
TEDDY?

YOU SEEM
A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS.

I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

YOU, UM...

YOU MIGHT WANNA
PUT ON SOME CLOTHES

'CAUSE THERE'S STILL
QUITE A DRAFT IN HERE.

[sniffles]

DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TIME

I ENTERTAINED
A SMALL WAGER

ON MY ABILITIES TO GO
AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS?

[chuckles]

WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
IT WAS QUITE AN ADVENTURE.

TOGETHER WITH MY--
MY TRUSTED VALET <i>PASSEPARTOUT,</i>

OH, MY GOSH, WE DID--
WE DID SO MANY THINGS

NEITHER ONE OF US
WOULD EVER HAVE DONE

IF WE HAD NOT ACCEPTED
THIS CHALLENGE.

AND, UH, WE RODE
ON A HOT AIR BALLOON...

YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LISTEN TO ME, ARE YOU?

YOU'RE JUST GONNA
KEEP TALKING, RIGHT?

'CAUSE NEITHER ONE OF US HAD
EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT

AND, UH,
AND HAD NO TRAINING.

NO--NO REAL,
FORMAL TRAINING.

AND HE WAS ALLERGIC
TO WICKER IN THE BASKET, SO,

THEY'RE ALL
MADE OUT OF WICKER,

AND--AND I DON'T
LIKE HEIGHTS.

I DON'T HAVE MANY PHOBIAS,
BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS.

UM, BUT, UM...

OH, AND WE RODE
ON AN ELEPHANT,

WHICH WAS JUST
SO INCREDIBLE.

I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE EVER DONE THAT.

THEY'RE VERY BIG
AND LUMBERING.

THEY LUMBER ALONG,
AND YOU LOOK KIND OF...

AND THEY FEEL LIKE
A CRUMB CAKE.

IF YOU'VE EVER TOUCHED
AN ELEPHANT--

IF YOU'VE EVER GOTTEN REALLY,
YOU KNOW,

CLOSE AND PERSONAL
WITH AN ELEPHANT,

IT, UM, IT CAN BE
QUITE AN EXPERIENCE.

AND, UH, IN--

AND YOUR THIGHS START
TO STRENGTHEN AFTER A WHILE.

UM, THAT'S ALL I NEEDED.

THAT'S ALL I NEEDED
TO BE SATISFIED.

I NEEDED TO RIDE
AN ELEPHANT

AND, UM, AND--

AND HAVE STRONGER THIGHS.

[Vivaldi's <i>Four Seasons</i>
<i>playing]</i>

â™ª

AH! AH!

[cell phone
playing jingle]

[sizzling,
phone line ringing]

[cell phone
playing jingle]

YES?

HEY, HAVE YOU LEFT YET?
YES!

NEED YOU TO STOP OFF
AT THE CREST FOODS ON ELM.

THEY HAVE
THE BEST ORGANIC SELECTION.

YOU STILL HAVE THE LIST,
RIGHT?

YES!
OKAY, WELL, GREAT.

THANK YOU.
PLEASE HURRY HOME.

YES!


[bell rings]
OH.

I HOPE
THEY HAVE CHOCOLATE CAKE.

THERE WAS THAT TIME
AT THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.

DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT THAT ONE?

YES, YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE.

OH, WELL, OKAY.

NO, BUT IT WAS INTERESTING.
IT WAS SO FASCINATING 'CAUSE--

BOOKS ARE REALLY FASCINATING.
IT'S SO FASCINATING.

LISTEN.
IT'S BEEN A GREAT TIME.

REALLY INTERESTING.
HAPPY READING.

[door creaks]

TEDDY!
LUNCH IS THIS WAY.

[silent]

OH, NO.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

GEORGE, GO AHEAD
AND GO TO LUNCH.

YOU KNOW THE WAY.
PUT HIM DOWN!

YOU NEED TO SETTLE DOWN AND ACT
LIKE EVERY OTHER PATIENT.

I AM NOT
ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS!

MY NAME IS
DR. FREDERICK MULBERRY!

I AM
A PROFESSIONAL PSYCHIATRIST.

IF YOU WANT TO SORT THIS OUT,
CALL MY SECRETARY.

CALL MY WIFE!

OKAY, TEDDY.
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

405...
MM-HMM.

405-5--UH...
EXACTLY.

NOW, JUST GO TO LUNCH!

I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER!
I DON'T REMEMBER IT!

TEDDY, I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
NOT EVERYBODY REMEMBERS

THEIR OWN NUMBER!
ENOUGH!

[light music playing]

â™ª

HEY, MR. MULBERRY.

NEED SOME HELP?

IT'S ME, COLIN.

ROSE'S FRIEND?

I SAW YOU WHEN YOU DROPPED HER
OFF AT SCHOOL TODAY.

COLIN! RIGHT.
COLIN. AH.

OKAY. COLIN.
COLIN.

WELL, THE EFFORT
DOESN'T MAKE ME GO.

I'M GONNA GO ANYWAY, SO...
YEAH, I KNOW.

COME ON.

WHERE ARE WE GOING ANYWAY?

RIGHT OVER HERE.
GOING TO LUNCH.

I LIKE THIS TILE.
WHAT IS IT, TERRA COTTA?

NO, UH-UH.
YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

YEAH.
I DOUBT IT.

I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
OF A PULL YOU HAVE HERE,

BUT, UM--
WHEN YOU GUARD--

BUT, UM, I WAS, UH--

THANK YOU.

I JUST--IF YOU CAN GET ME
OUT OF HERE,

I WOULD...

REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

AND IT'S--
IT'S LIKE, UM,

IT'S AMAZING KARMA

WHEN YOU DO GOOD THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

TEDDY, YOU ALREADY
KNOW THE RULES.

WHAT NURSE NANCY SAYS GOES.

[sighs]
ORDER SOMETHING.

OH, MY GOD.

EVERY--IS IT YELLOW DAY?

I'LL HAVE THE--

I'LL HAVE THE--
THE CORN.

WELL, IS THAT CORN?
WHAT IS THAT?

CORN--CREAM OF CORN
OR CORN--CORN--

THE--THE ACORN DOESN'T FALL
TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.

OKAY, I'LL HAVE
SOME OF THE CORN.

THAT CORN THERE.

AND SOME OF IT.
NOT A LOT.

AND THEN, UM, I'M JUST HERE
FOR--TEMPORARILY.

AND, UH, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL HAVE, LIKE, A BEAN.

BUT NO MORE THAN THAT.
I DON'T WANT THAT.

AND I WOULD LIKE--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
SOME OF THE CORN.

DEFINITELY NO CHEESE,
AND I'LL HAVE--

THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DIDN'T WANT.

HEY, JASON.
LOAD IT UP.

[sighs]
OH, HEY, HEY.

HI. CAN--CAN YOU
GET ME OUT OF HERE?

WHAT IS THIS, <i>FAWLTY TOWERS?</i>

WHAT...

HELLO? MR. MAGOO?
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

YEAH, BUDDY.


UH, ALL'S WELL
THAT ENDS WELL.

ALL RIGHT, JASON.

[light instrumental music]

UH, SIR...

I WANTED TO ASK YOU...

DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE

I COULD TAKE ROSE
TO THE SPRING DANCE?

WELL, HAVE YOU ASKED HER?
NOT YET.

I WAS GOING TO SEND HER
A TEXT LATER TONIGHT.

TEXT? WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HER IN PERSON?

WELL, I ONLY SEE HER
AT SCHOOL.

SHE'S ALWAYS
WITH HER OTHER FRIENDS.

WELL, COME OVER, UH,
COME OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

REALLY?

IT'S FAMILY DINNER.
COME OVER.

WE ALWAYS HAVE FAMILY DINNER.

GREAT. I GET OFF AT 6:00.
I CAN HEAD RIGHT OVER.

THAT'S FANTASTIC.

TEDDY...
HI.

I HAVE
REALLY HORRIBLE NEWS.

<i>YOU</i> HAVE HORRIBLE NEWS?
YES.

SOON AS I GET OUT OF HERE,
MY WIFE'S GONNA KILL ME.

WAIT, WHAT?

[sighs]

ALL I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
WAS DUCK IN,

SIGN SOME PAPERS,
AND DUCK OUT--THAT WAS IT.

OKAY, UH, TEDDY,
I REALLY NEED YOU TO LISTEN.

THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET ME
OUT OF HERE.

WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
OKAY, TEDDY, I'M SERIOUS.

THERE'S A DOCTOR
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW

WHO CAME IN AND SIGNED A FORM
TO KEEP ME IN HERE.

TEDDY...
YEAH?

CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

RIGHT NOW?
OKAY. YEAH, SURE.

SORRY.
JUST A MINUTE.

I'M SORRY.

[claps hands]
LET'S GO.

I'M COMIN', I'M COMIN'.
HE IS THE MAN.

ALL RIGHT, SO DON'T WORRY,
I'M NOT GONNA--AGH!

LISTEN, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM DOLORES.

[choking] WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

LISTEN, IF I EVER CATCH YOU
TALKING TO HER AGAIN,

I WILL LOCK YOU UP
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

THE REST
OF YOUR NATURAL-BORN LIFE.

YOU GOT ME?
GUH!

[gags and coughs]

ENJOY YOUR LUNCH, BUDDY.

[chokes]

UHH.

 <i>BUENO.</i>


<i>CUANDO TE VAS</i>
<i>A LA CANTINA,</i>

<i>ME DICES QUE VAS</i>
<i>A LA IGLESIA.</i>

OH, OH.

<i>NO ES LA VERDAD.</i>

<i>NO ES LA VERDAD.</i>

<i>O CUANDO DICES</i>
<i>QUE ESTAS CON TUS AMIGOS--</i>

 <i>O CUANDO DICES</i>
<i>QUE ESTAS CON TUS AMIG--</i>

<i>NO ES LA VERDAD.</i>
<i>- WHY DOESN'T THIS ONE WORK?</i>

CAN I TRY THIS ONE?

 <i>BUENO, OTRA MENTIRA.</i>
<i>[beep]</i>

<i>NI NADA ME SORPRENDE</i>
<i>DE TI.</i>

CAN I JUST TRY THIS ONE?
NO!

<i>NI NADA ME SORPRENDE</i>
<i>DE TI.</i>

<i>YO SABIA QUE ESO</i>
<i>IBA A PASAR.</i>

I JUST WANTED TO TRY ONE.

CASH OR CREDIT?

UM...
[cell phone playing jingle]

 <i>BUENO.</i>

<i>AY, COMO ERES ESTUPIDO!</i>

ME?
HELLO?

WHAT IS TAKING YOU SO LONG?
HI.

OH, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS TAKING LONG.

AM I TAKING--
IS THIS LONG?

[sighs]

ON YOUR WAY HOME,
I NEED YOU TO STOP

AND GET FREDDIE
FROM SCHOOL.

APPARENTLY,
HE'S IN TROUBLE AGAIN.

I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEAL WITH THIS TODAY.

WHAT ABOUT THIS?
OKAY.

WHAT IF I GO OUTSIDE
OF THE SUPERMARKET,

I GET IN THE CAR,
AND I PUT MY SEATBELT ON,

AND I GOT THAT THING
THAT'S NOT REALLY A KEY,

BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A KEY,
AND THEN IT STARTS,

AND THEN WE'LL GO,
AND I WILL GO GET HIM

AT--WHERE AM I GOING?

[sighs]
AT ST. MARY'S,

WHERE YOU WENT THIS MORNING?

OKAY, BYE.
IS THAT A HOSPITAL? HELLO?

OH, NOW YOU READY?

I'M READY.
I WAS READY WHEN I GOT HERE.

WHERE AM I GOING? I DON'T--
YOUR MONEY.

<i>TENGO UNA LINEA.</i>
<i>- OH, MY MONEY, YEAH, YEAH.</i>

OKAY, IT'S NOT--
THAT TIME WAS MY FAULT.

THE OTHER STUFF
WAS YOUR FAULT

'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

'CAUSE I--
DO YOU SPEAK SPANISH?

<i>BUENO. CIAO.</i>

OKAY.
 <i>CIAO.</i>

2 IS 30--34, 35.
37 BEANS.

37 BEANS,
I-I-I CAN'T DIVIDE BY TWO.

CAN'T TO 37 BY 2.
TH-TH-THAT'S--

THAT'S A FRACTION.
THAT'S A FRACTION OF A BEAN.

THAT'S .5, .5 BEANS.

I...

36.

7. TH-TH--37.

I HAVE 37.

WHY WOULD YOU
INVITE COLIN OVER?

I'M HOME!

GET THESE GROCERIES.

NO LAUGHING!

[giggling]

TOLD YA SO.

[euphonium blowing out of key]

â™ª

ENOUGH!

ENOUGH!
JUST STOP IT.

I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE
MY EARS BLEEDING ANYMORE.

I NEED THEM TO HEAR, ALL RIGHT?
I NEED TO THINK.

YOU'RE WEARING THAT?

I JUST--I THINK IT'LL BE
A LITTLE HARD TO PRACTICE

WITH--WITH THAT, UH...
WITH...

I GUESS YOU JUST MIGHT
HAVE TO PLAY WITHOUT ME.

SORRY.
OH, UH, WELL--

WELL, ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT'S JUST--

IT WON'T BE THE SAME.
AND--

YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
WE'RE, UH, BREAKING UP

BEFORE WE EVEN HAVE A HIT,
UH, YOU KNOW?

SO MAYBE--MAYBE YOU COULD,
UH, RECONSIDER.

MAYBE YOU COULD--

Y--NO, YOU JUST--
YOU JUST DON'T STOP.

YOU DON'T STOP, YOU JUST--
STOP?

YOU CAN STOP.
YOU CAN STOP TALKING.

RIGHT NOW, I'M FEELING A
LITTLE BIT LIKE PAUL MCCARTNEY,

AND YOU'RE LIKE JOHN LENNON,
AND WE'RE ON THE ROOF,

AND THE POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY.
THAT'S A <i>LET IT BE</i> REFERENCE!

OH, THAT'S SO SMART!
UH, OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW--

DO I LOOK LIKE I WANT
TO HEAR THIS RIGHT NOW?

OH, GOD, JUST GO, GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO.

I'M GONNA GO, AND THEN,
YOU KNOW,

JUST WHEN YOU FEEL UP TO IT--
YEAH.

WE'LL GET THE BAND GOING,
THOUGH.

I'M SURE IT WILL WORK OUT.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.

COME ON, BERT, LET'S GO.
OH, LOOK, AN ASIAN!

HEY, IT'S YOKO.


OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD.

WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
WHERE DID THAT--

LET'S STAY ON POINT.

I'VE BEEN OVER YOUR SITUATION.

[sighs]

I THINK I CAN HELP YOU
GET OUT OF HERE.

WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU--

ABOUT TONIGHT?

TONIGHT WILL DO
JUST FINE, YES.

BUT THEY'RE WATCHING YOU.

THEY ARE ALWAYS
WATCHING YOU.

ARE THEY WATCHING--
ARE THEY WATCHING ME,

OR ARE THEY
WATCHING EVERYBODY?

IT COULD BE ANY OF THEM.

THERE'S NO TELLING
WHO THEY'RE PAYING OFF.

[inhales deeply]

YOU MEAN THEY'RE PAYING THEIR
PATIENTS TO SPY ON EACH OTHER?

OF COURSE THEY ARE.

TONIGHT, THEN.
THE SOUTH CORRIDOR.

JUST AFTER LIGHTS OUT.

TELL NO ONE.

I WON'T.
I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYBODY.

NO ONE.

[electronic humming]

SO--

GOD, THAT GUY
LOOKS LIKE HE SHOULD BE

IN THE KINGS OF LEON.

UHH.

AWW, HANNIBAL,
THEY PUT YOU IN A DIAPER.

YEAH.

BECAUSE, UH...
WELL, YOU KNOW,

I POOP
THROUGH MY PORES.

THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
THE PORE POOPER.

I'M SORRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

I'M SORRY
THEY LOCKED YOU UP IN HERE.

WELL,
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.

MAYBE I DO BELONG
IN HERE.

WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

BECAUSE...MY MOM
COULDN'T HANDLE LIFE,

SO GUESS I CAN'T EITHER.

YOUR MOM
IS YOUR MOM.

YOU...ARE YOU.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

YEAH.

WELL, DO YOU WANT
TO HELP ME HANG THESE POSTERS?

UM...

YEAH, BECAUSE THIS
IS GOOD TIMING.

I THINK IT IS.

I CAN STICK MY TAPE
BETWEEN YOUR ARMS.

THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
BUT YOU MIGHT BE--

YOU KNOW, JUST WATCH OUT
'CAUSE I MIGHT DROP IT

'CAUSE I HAVE--
I HAVE POOP SLIPPAGE.

[laughing] OKAY.

THIS IS SO GOOD.

[munching and slurping]

SHOULD WE SAY GRACE
OR...

AMEN?

PRAYER?
PRAY?

SHOULD WE PRAY?

I THINK
WE SHOULD PRAY.

AHEM.


DEAR GOD.

I WANT TO THANK YOU

AND JESUS...

AND MARY AND...

[inhales deeply]

ZEUS AND...KRISHNA

AND OTHER...
EVERYONE.

IT'S NOT JUST YOU GUYS.

THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
WATCHING THIS.

THERE'S THE KABALAS

AND BUDDHA.

UM...THE EXPLORERS,

LIKE DORA AND GOLLUM

AND...

IKE AND TINA TURNER.

PECOS BILL.

UM, COLDPLAY.

THAT SONG, <i>YELLOW,</i>

GOD...

OHH.

MAKES ME SICK.

AND THANK YOU
FOR ALLOWING US

TO HELP CONCEIVE
THIS ONE,

THE LITTLE ONE OVER THERE
ACROSS THE TABLE

AND THE OTHER ONE, THE--
THE DAUGHTER,

AND...THE CHINESE
THAT BROUGHT THIS FOOD HERE

AND SLAVED AWAY
AND BUILT AN EMPIRE,

JUST TO MAKE THIS PLATE,
EVENTUALLY,

FOR US TO ENJOY
OR SAVOR IN OUR MOUTHS,

OUR PALATES.

OKAY, WELL,
I THINK THAT'S IT.

GOD BLESS US ALL.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

AND...I LOVE YOU.

AMEN.

AMEN.
AMEN.

I HAVE TO GO MAKE
ANOTHER BATCH OF GRANOLA.

YOU GUYS JUST
GO AHEAD AND START.

[whispering]
YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU?

NO, NO.
YOU STAY HERE. EAT.

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

TEDDY...
WE'RE YOUR FAMILY HERE.

WE DON'T DO THIS STUFF
TO HURT YOU.

TURN AROUND.
IT'S TO PROTECT YOU.

YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS DOOR
UNLOCKED,

JUST IN CASE YOU GET UPSET.

DON'T DO NOTHIN' STUPID.

ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT.

WELL, YEAH, UM...

APPARENTLY
TOM, UH, SAWYER

IT'S A REAL MESS,

OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

DO YOU--DO YOU THINK
I OUGHT TO HELP?

UH, NO, 'CAUSE, UH...
JIM'S COMING BY.

REALLY? OH!
JIM IS SUCH A HOOT.

I-I-I, OH,
I SO ENJOY SEEING HIM.

HE'S REALLY, REALLY VERY FUNNY,
I REMEMBER.

YOU GOTTA BE QUIET.
OTHERWISE, JIM'S NOT COMING BY.

YOU KNOW JIM.

OH, YOU'RE DARN TOOTIN'
I KNOW JIM.

HEH.
[whispered squeal]

[door shuts]

[sighs]

PSST!

OH, MY GOD!

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

YOU COME HERE TO CHIT-CHAT
OR YOU WANNA GET OUT OF HERE?

I NEED SOME ANSWERS.

WHAT KIND OF ANSWERS?

I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE THE FILING ROOM IS.

THAT WOULD INVOLVE
GETTING PAST THE DOGS.

ARMED GUARDS.
LASER BEAMS.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A MINIMUM-SECURITY FACILITY.

[chuckles]

THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU
TO THINK.

FORTUNATELY FOR YOU, I HAVE MAPS
OF THE ENTIRE FACILITY.

GREAT.

THESE AREN'T GONNA WORK.

WHY NOT? THEY'RE MAPS.
I KNOW THEY'RE MAPS.

THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE
DRAWN UP BY RAIN MAN AND CHARLIE

AND THEY ALL GOT TOGETHER
AND DID THIS MESS.

THAT'S WHAT THEY
WANT YOU TO THINK.

WHO WANTS ME
TO THINK THAT?

I THINK THIS IS--
LOOKS LIKE A--

HOW TO WIN <i>ANGRY BIRDS.</i>
<i>- REALLY?</i>

OR WHAT IS THIS,
<i>BEING JOHN MALKOVICH?</i>

WELL, THEN, MAYBE I'LL JUST
SAVE THEM FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

THAT'S YOUR LIFE.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

WHERE DO I GO?
POINT!

WHERE? COMMIT.

OH, MY GOD.

THAT WAY?
THIS WAY.

MR. PHILBROOK--
DON'T YOU GET SMART WITH ME.

YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING.
I CAN TELL.

STAY AWAY
FROM MY SPEECH TOMORROW.

I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT,

AND I CAN TAKE IT AWAY,
JUST LIKE THAT.

GOOD EVENING, TEDDY.

HI! HELLO.

I WISH I HAD
MY INVISIBLE CLOAK.

I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA TAKE
ALL THE BOOKS

WE'RE GONNA NEED
FOR THIS MISSION.

I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GONNA DO IT.

WE NEED EVERY ONE
OF THESE BOOKS ON THIS BED.

EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THESE BOOKS.

WE JUST NEED LIKE LITTLE
PASSAGES FROM SOME OF THEM.

BUT EVERY BOOK ON THIS BED
IS GONNA HELP US

TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO,
AND I--

I--I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GONNA DO IT.

AND THEN I GOTTA
PUT CLOTHES IN HERE TOO.

'CAUSE I HAVE TO--
I CAN'T WEAR THE SAME THING

TWO DAYS IN A ROW.

I'VE GOT--I HAVE TO HAVE
DIFFERENT CLOTHING.

YOU KNOW, IF I HAD THAT
INVISIBILITY CLOAK,

THIS WOULD BE A MOOT POINT.

WHOA.

CAN I COME IN?

OKAY? YEAH?

SO...

FOUND A DELIVERY SERVICE THAT
CAN TAKE OUT THE BOXES TOMORROW.

I KNOW! IT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT?
THAT'S--YES.

THAT'S GREAT!
IT'S GOOD.

NO, THAT'S AMAZING.
YEAH! YEAH.

SO THAT'S GOOD.
YES!

UM...ARE YOU GOOD?
[scoffs]

YOU WERE KIND OF QUIET
AT DINNER, YOU KNOW.

LITTLE BIT.
YEAH, IT WAS JUST...

YOU KNOW, I'M JUST...

IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH MR. PHILBROOK?

YES.

ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, JUST, YOU KNOW.

IT'S--IT'S FI--

YOU KNOW.

HE'S...

HE'S NOT NICE TO ME.

HE'S NEVER NICE TO YOU.

AND YOU JUST TAKE IT
AND YOU...

SORRY.

YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY, I JUST--
I CAME OUT HERE TO...

APOLOGIZE.

I, UH...

I ALWAYS CRITICIZE YOU

FOR PUTTING
YOUR WORK FIRST,

IN FRONT OF US
AND THE KIDS,

AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT MY SON WAS GONE.

OUR SON.

SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST GONNA,

I DON'T KNOW,

TAKE A STEP BACK
OR SOMETHING AND...

PUT WHAT'S REALLY--YOU KNOW,
WHAT REALLY MATTERS FIRST,

WHICH IS THE KIDS,

AND--AND YOU,
AND OUR MARRIAGE.

WHAT'S LEFT
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

YOU KNOW?

IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK
INSIDE TONIGHT...

[chuckles nervously]

WELL...

THE INVITE'S OPEN.

OKAY.

IN ALMOST A YEAR.

WOW.

[laughs softly]

TEDDY?

I-I'M FRED.

I'M DR. FREDERICK MULBERRY.

I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT--

THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING MISSING?

ME TOO.

YOU'RE SO HANDSOME.

[chuckles]

THAT'S WHAT I TELL HER
EVERY DAY.

I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A BROTHER.


LET'S GO.

CAN I HAVE Y'ALL COME
TO THE STAGE, PLEASE?

[muttering softly]
IF I BECOME GOVERNOR

OF THIS GREAT STATE...

ALL RIGHT, DOES EVERYBODY
HAVE THEIR PART?

SHE'S WITH THE CREEPS!

NO, SHE'S WITH ME!

MULBERRY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY.

I'M FINISHED DOING
WHAT YOU TELL ME TO DO.

YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.

MY MISTAKE
WAS NOT PUTTING MY FAMILY FIRST.

CLEARLY THAT
IS NOT A CONCERN FOR YOU.

HEY, MISTER,
CAN WE HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

SURE.

WHATEVER.

HERE YOU GO.

THANK YOU.
YOU GOT A PEN ALREADY?

YEAH.

THIS CONVERSATION
IS OVER, MULBERRY.

FORTUNATELY FOR ME,

IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.

HOW ABOUT WHAT I THINK...

DAD?

YOUNG LADY,
D-DO I KNOW YOU?

SECURITY!

YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO DENY ME AGAIN?

[scoffs]
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

SHE KNOWS.

[on P.A.]
WE ALL KNOW.

MY MOTHER DIED
BECAUSE OF YOU.

AND YOU'VE HAD ME LOCKED UP
IN THERE FOR YEARS.

YOU'RE MY FATHER.

HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.

OH, OF COURSE I CAN.

[chuckles]
WELL, COME ON.

LET'S BE REASONABLE.

I'M--I'M SURE WE CAN COME
TO SOME KIND OF, UH,

A FINANCIAL RESOLUTION.

IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

IT'S ABOUT THE FAMILY.

I ALREADY HAD A FAMILY.

YOUR MOTHER
TRIED TO BLACKMAIL ME.

I COULDN'T RAISE YOU AND--
AND MY OTHER FAMILY.

I'M OUT OF HERE.

[awkward silence]

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY,

IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE
SHOCK THERAPY.

[gun pops,
electricity crackles]

SAY HELLO
TO MY LITTLE FRIEND.


NOW, COME ON, DEAR.

THAT WOMAN
IS NOT MY DAUGHTER.

MULBERRY, YOU'RE THROUGH.

I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.

SO MUCH FOR FAMILY VALUES.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

YEAH. FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME.

DR. MULBERRY,

I AM SO SORRY.

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
YOURSELF AN ATTORNEY.

BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING.

NOT FOR YOU.

I HAVE A BROTHER,
