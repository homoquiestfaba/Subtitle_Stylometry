[deep inhale]




[birds chirping]

Kevin, have you
ever done this before?

Like... planned to
hook up with somebody?

Like, set a date? [laughs]

Yeah.

No. [chuckles]

Can I ask you something?

What?

Why do you want to do this?

Do what? [giggles]


I mean, the timing of
the whole thing is just...

The funeral was...

I just... I find you really
attractive and you're a good

actor, and you're smart.

That's a turn-on.

I mean, you said the other day
in class that 'The Old Man and

the Sea' was your favorite book
and I just thought that was very

wise of you.

Well, that's very nice of you.

Thank you.

Now you have to say
something about me.

Something nice.


Yeah.

O... okay, um...

you...

uh, you... you
have... I like your,

uh, sense of fashion.
[laughs]

that... is that weird?

Do you want something else?

I have...


Um, you should
take this off, right?

Might get in the way...
Uh, yeah, for sure.

Or something.

could give me a hickey?


Why?

I... I think they're pretty.

Aren't they just,
like, popped blood vessels?

Yeah. [laughs]

So?


[both laugh]

Just...

â™ª soft ambient music â™ª

Things have been weird.


At least I've been coping well.

I mean, I haven't been
cutting myself or...

drinking or taking drugs,
so that's cool... I think.


Uh, we haven't really talked
about it since the funeral...


I mean, all these... these
strangers were there and,

um...

they all said they were my
mom's best friend but...

I mean, how could they have
been if I had never met them,

you know?



It's good?

Sophieee!
[Sophie] Whaaat?

Hi, baby, I love you.

Mwah.
Oh, okay.

Love you, too.

The claws.


Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

It's okay.

Hello.

Okay, so we can...

Hey.
[Riley] You're late, kid.

You like your ladder, boy?

I do.

You should go check yours out.

Okay, I will.
[Riley] [laughs]

[multiple people] Whoa!

[overlapping shouting]

[Ms. Baum] It's okay,
we're good, we're good!

being a drama queen.

[overlapping
shouting and laughter]

All right.


Oh.

So scary. [laughs]

I know.

I saw that you were jumpy
and I just saw an opportunity.


I mean, I...

I know this is stupid
but I am a little nervous.

Why?

It's just tech week.

I just... I want to be perfect.

Which sounds
insane, but whatever.

I mean...

you're gonna do great, Jones.

Don't even worry about it.
[Sophie] [sighs] Okay, Riley.

Thank you.


What?
What even... did y... what...

Don't touch!

Let me... I just
want to feel it!

Okay, no!

Don't do that.
[laughs]

[overlapping chatter]


Hey, what's up?

Um...

uh, about the... the hi...

Oh, no, no, it's cool.

I... it doesn't hurt or anything.

Really?

It hurts a little bit.


I'm sorry. [laugh]

Yeah, it's... it's okay.
Okay.

Um, break a leg.

You too. [laughs]

How far have you guys gone?

Um, we've only

um, made out a little bit.

Mm.
Mm.

Sexy.

Works to your advantage.

What do you mean?

Don't you

Okay...

HUMPING A PILLOW?!

[both laugh]

You do!

Yes, I do...[laughs]
masturbate by humping a pillow.

[both giggle]

Okay?

Don't know how that happened,
I just... discovered it.


What do you think is next?

Like...

are you gonna let
him eat you out?

No.

Why?

I mean, I just... I
feel like I'm gonna laugh!

That's, like,
the way girls come.

I'm going to laugh.

It's going to tickle.

It's not gonna
tickle! [laughs]

How could it not?

A person's, like,
little tongue...

[both giggle]

licking my vagina?

That's so... gross.

It's not gross.

I kinda wanna blow him, though.

Really?

Yeah.
Yeah?

I, uh... [laughs] I feel
like it gives me the power.

You know?

'Cause I could just bite
his dick off if I wanted to.

[both laugh]

You know?
Yeah, yeah.

â™ª "Ad Nauseam" by MUTT â™ª


Yeah.

We don't have napkins.


maybe paper towel.

You excited about tomorrow?

Sophie?

What?

Are you excited
about opening night?


yeah.

Good.

Actually, Dad, I
was gonna ask you.

I know this is kind of a huge
favor but I was wondering if we

could host one of the cast
parties at the end of the month.

Sophie...


Yeah, what not?
[Sophie] Really?

Sure.
[Lucy] Dad...

[Sophie] That would be awesome.
Yeah, I think that'd be good.

No, I don't
think you understand.

What?

I mean, like, there's gonna be
drugs and alcohol and sex and...

I just don't think you should be
promoting that kind of behavior.

Well, I didn't know that's
what happened at cast parties.

It doesn't.
It does.


I mean, we're not hosting a
party if... if that's what... if

that's what happens, all right?

Do you understand?


What are we gonna do
with all these flowers?

Hey, uh, Sophie, uh, do...

[both laugh]
[Sophie] Yeah, sure.

â™ª "Damage" by James Meyers â™ª


I don't really want to

Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm not... I'm
not gonna bite you.

Wait. [laughs]

I'd hope not.

I was... I was
joking. [laughs]


But, um...
We don't have to.

I can... I can do
something for you.

If you want, I mean.

Like what?

Um, you can switch with
me if you want. [laughs]

[laughs] Okay.
Okay?

Yeah.
You wanna s... sit down?

[Kevin] Yeah.

Um...

Maybe just... just

Can you...

Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. [laughs]

Oh, shit. [laughs]

Yeah, okay, just,
like, take them...?

Yeah.
Okay.

Um...

Um, no, you

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I tried texting you last night.

Yeah, I saw.

Uh, can you stay and... talk?
No, I have to go.



â™ª "Infinit" by Max Tartaglia â™ª

So do you know a lot of
people that are gonna be here?

Um, kind of.

Like, they're all in my... I
mean, they're all in my grade.

Like, I don't know if
we're "friends" but...

I know them.

You'll love them
and they'll love you.


I'm serious, Soph.

[Sophie] [chuckles]
I'm serious!

Okay.

Do you need me to
pluck that brow?

that crazy one that makes you

look like Frida Kahlo.

Can you blow on my face?

[both laugh]

Can you please blow on my face?

[blows]
[laughs]

Okay, I haven't
even plucked one yet,

so...

I feel like these hairs just...

I feel like
you're picking my nose.


You can pick my... Sophie,
isn't that what best friends do?

Ow.

Okay, do you want brow gel?

I just don't think
I can walk in these.


It's for fashion.

So, are you guys

like...?

What the fuck, Sophie?!


I mean, this is my ex.

Oh, yeah!

I'm so dumb.

â™ª â™ª

Hey. [chuckles]

Hey, Sophie.


Sorry, I just... I don't know if
I'm supposed to be in here or...

That's okay.

Come in.

You have a really nice house.

Thank you.

[Tony] Hey, Kate.
Hey.

Um... who was that?

You don't know who that is?

No.

For real?

Yeah.

That's Tony.

has a huge crush on you.

No.


Oh, my gosh, in math
class, he's always spacing out,

and, like, when he
wakes up, he says,

"I had the most wonderful
dream about Sophie Jones."

You're joking.

I'm not!

You should totally fuck him.

He has this long list of
sophomore girls waiting to just

suck his dick.

He's kind of a legend.

Okay.

[both laugh]

You know Savannah?

Yeah.

Okay, so she fucked him, right?

And she told me that the
first time they had sex,

he put on 'Reservoir Dogs' and
asked her to take a shower with

him.

His dad was
upstairs the whole time.

Seriously, it's so hot.

Yeah, that's crazy.

should totally do it.

So, um...

you've had sex, then, right?

Of course.

You haven't?

What's it like?

I can't even begin to explain.


Okay.

I think I'm gonna
go talk to him.

Mm-mm, no.

I will talk to him in class.

I'll give him your number.

It's the chase he's after.

If you show you're into
him, he won't be interested.

You get it?

Got it.

Okay.


Okay, do yo want some?

Um, no, thanks.

I... I don't do that.

Okay, suit yourself.

Oh my God, Riley,
are... are you okay?!

[vomiting sounds]

Okay.

[vomiting continues]


Oh, God.




[both laugh]

Jesus Christ.

Oh my God, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to laugh.

That was mean.

Not mean.

You're fine.

You have a little something.

Oh.

No, that side.

What?

[groans pitifully]


Just put it in the toilet.

[both laugh]

Fuck off.


Why won't you tell me
about what happened with Kev?

I don't really want to
talk about that right now.

I mean, [laughs] ask him
if you're so concerned.

I did.

He's... he's pretty
torn up about it.

Okay.

I'd really...

I'd really love it if you
guys could be friends again.

For my sake.

Maybe just, like,
all hang out and...


I... I just miss you.

I just...

I should go.

What?

Where... wait, I'm your ride.

I'll walk.

Hey!

â™ª soft ambient music â™ª

coffee is coming.

[Lucy] Morning!
[Sophie] Morning.

[Lucy] Thank you.
Do you want coffee?

Um, I'm okay, thank you.


and Brian, huh?

you hear about that?

There's nothing to talk about.

I heard that he was
looking at your butt.


And that's it.

Do you think you're
gonna...[whispering] bone?

[chokes and laughs] No!

God, no.

what was that?


Nothing.

Sophie's just being weird.



No, it's not...

She went on a date with Brian.

I did not, I went to lunch!

I went to lunch.

You did?

And we... we didn't
even, like, go out,

we just ate our own
packed lunches in a hallway.

It wasn't... [laughs]

You sat in the hallway
and ate your pack lunches?

Sounds like a date
to me, right, Sophie?


It's okay, you
don't have to be so,

like, mmm about it.

Like, it's fine, he's cute.
I'm not being "mmm" about it.

I gotta run.
[Sophie] Okay.


Love you guys.

It's your turn.

Robertson took you on a date?

It's still crazy.

We had sushi and then we went
to his house afterwards and his

dad was there and
we all had tea...

His dad?!

Had tea together.

Like a tea party?

Yeah.

That's so weird.

He must really like you.

I don't know, I... I
don't want all this,

like, extra stuff.

So you don't want any tea?

[both laugh]

No, I just...
No, seriously, why?

I... you know, knowing
someone wants me, like,

to meet their
dad, that's weird.

Like, that turns me off.

You know?

It's weird.

Not really.

I...
So what?

I mean, I just... I like
it being mindless more.

Sophie, you know you can
talk to me about... whatever,

right?

I know that.

Okay, then maybe this Tony
Robertson thing isn't such a

good idea.

Okay, well, what do you mean?

I mean...

it just seems like
ever since your mom died,

you've turned into
this crazy nympho.


I'm not crazy, Claire.

I know, Sophie.

But how many guys have you
hooked up with since January?

Only a few.

Yeah.

Only a few but, like,
it's from literally what,

nothing?

I dated in middle school.

Come on, Soph, that's not
what we're talking about.

I touched Ethan
Williams' dick, remember?

Yeah, we all did that.

We all touched his dick.

Look, Sophie, I just
don't want you getting hurt.

Guys are assholes.

They don't have feelings.

They just see us as
objects that they can fuck.

When they come, they leave.

Have any of the guys you've
hooked up with even made you

come, Sophie?

What are you
even talking about?

I mean, I'm
talking about, like,

pleasure.

Do you feel pleasure?

Have any of the
guys you've been,

like, made you feel like that?

[both chuckle]

Wh...?
Like...

Like what?

Have they made me feel pleasure?

Yeah, they haven't, have they?

That's not the point, Sophie.

All I'm saying is that
people have been talking.

I'm just concerned.

What people?

People in my grade and
people in your grade.

about what other people think?

they say about my best friend,

yeah!

Why wouldn't I care?

Well, I... I just don't care
what people think about me.

I don't.

At all.

So if you have a
problem with me,

you can just fuck off.

I can fuck off?

Sophie, are you
joking right now?!

Sophie!

Are you gonna get
your fucking lunch?!

â™ª moody rock music â™ª

I mean, I thought
you didn't want to.

I mean, that's what I
thought initially but...

Uh-huh.
Um...

I have this
theory, like...

all these intense
things happening in my life,

it's a sign I should
just lose my virginity too.

I mean, I know it sounds crazy
but I just feel like if I do

this, then everything
will balance itself out,

you know?

I just need to get
everything out of the way,

you know?

Yeah.

So, uh, are you gonna
start smoking meth now?


Look, I thought you
wanted to have sex,

okay?

It wasn't just me.

Listen.

I do.

Of course.

I just want to make sure
it's what you want as well.

That's what I want, so...

[Tony] Good. [laughs]
[Sophie] So...



Ow.

Am I... am I hurting you?

No, of course not.

Fuck.

Uh...
Um...

Maybe you're
just not wet enough?

I don't know why,
it's just not going in,

you know?

Okay.

[both grunt]

Are... are you nervous?

I can just, like, eat you out.
No, don't be stupid.

Just push more.

All right, you've got it.

[both grunt]




Oh, it's in.


Oh, yeah, we're having sex.

[breathing heavily]

This is [grunts] sex?




Wait...
Shhh.

[heavy breathing]




Ow, what the fuck?!
[Sophie] Shit.

What the fuck?!

[Sophie] I'm sorry!
What the fuck?!

Ow!
I'm sorry!

I just don't want to
have sex right now,

okay?


What the fuck, Sophie?!

Are you fucking crazy?

Ow!
I'm sorry, okay?


Fuck...

What the fuck?

â™ª soft ambient music â™ª


It's me.

I know we haven't talked in
a while but I miss you and,

uh, I'd love to talk
soon, so just give me a call.

Okay, bye.

[soft crying]

Hi, Mom.

People keep saying
that... you're still here.

you in my heart or something.

It's not healthy
to think like that.

People say I, um...

have your eyes but...

I don't know if that's... that's
something people say to just be

nice or...

I don't know if I really
do have your... your eyes.

I, um...

I really hope you're...
you're not disappointed in me.

I mean, [laughs] all the
guys I've been hooking up with,

they're... they're hot, right?

there's something to that,

I guess.

I'm so sorry, Soph.

whatever, you know?

It's not, it's...

it's not okay.

I mean, at least he's a senior.

He'll be gone next year, right?


Right.

Wait, whoa.

Sophie, no!


You know why!

This... this is not you.

Okay, just, like...

No, I...
Wait.

Riley, I know you like me.

I can't do this
with you right now.

Oh, my God.

Fuck you, Riley.

Like, for r... really.
[Riley] Nice, nice.

Really.
[Riley] Real mature.

Fuck, close the
fucking door, okay?


[Sophie] Oh, my God.

When you go to school,
just pretend like it's work.

Hey!
Hey, Sammy.

Do you want me to

Um, maybe later.

Uh, Sophie, would it be
cool if we talked for a sec?


Um, sure.

Maybe in... in private?


Have fun!
Okay. [giggles]

So... what's up?

about you and Riley.

What about me and Riley?

Just that, like, you kind of
went to his house and tried to

throw yourself on him.

What?

That you tried to
force yourself on him.

I'm sorry, what?

It's just that he has a
thing with my sister and I...

Kate, yeah.

Yeah, they've
been dating for...

Did Riley tell you this?
Yes, he did.

I just think it's kind of fucked
that you'd try to do that.

And you believe him?

I mean, I just don't
want Kate getting hurt.

Is that okay?

Okay. [scoffs]

Well, you can tell

So it won't happen again?

You can bet on that.

just for today.

I don't know, Sophie.

If I say yes today, you're just
gonna want to eat lunch with me

and my friends every day.

Well, you know, Claire just
left and I really don't want to

eat lunch alone, so...

Why can't you just make
a friend your own age?

I don't like the

We've gone over this before.
What about Riley?

He still hasn't apologized.

Um, look, I have bio now, so...

Okay.

Please, Lucy?

No, Sophie.

I don't know, anything.

See, this is what I was

What are you talking about?

Look, you wanted to
have sex this time.

It wasn't me that
initiated it, so it's not...

No, no, I know, but...

be nice if we could just do

something else after.

It feels like we're always
having sex and then you're going

home.

Plan B is, um, it's most
effective if you take it right

away.

I mean, you wouldn't
want me getting pregnant,

right?

Are you okay?

About what?

Yeah.

Well, can I ask you a

I thought you were going home.

It's just, like,
you're my boyfriend,

I should, um...

I should know
everything about you,

right?

Yeah, but I don't
think this is about that.

I mean, you know my

It's... it's only
fair that I know yours,

right?

I don't.

Not really.

Look, I know that
your mom died, okay?

But I don't know much else.

You haven't really
opened up to me about that.

And hey, I really
wish you would,

you know?

I want you to feel comfortable
opening up to me and stuff.

You don't open up
much either, so...

Well, there's not much to say.

I, um...

I went to school...

the day my mom died.

I skipped all my classes and I
just... sat in the auditorium

like all day.

And then I went to rehearsal.

During break, I went to get my
phone and my dad had texted me

"Where are
you?" like 30 times.

He just kept calling me.

So I...

I knew it was happening.

So I ran home in the rain and I
pounded on the door and my aunt

let me in, and I raced upstairs.

She breathed a
couple of seconds more,

like she had been
waiting for me.

My dad cried.

It was the first time
I had seen him cry.

And my sister and I,
we went downstairs.

And I took a picture of a
vase... with a white rose in it

and some red wine in a glass.

Then I went
upstairs to say goodbye.

My aunt had washed her body.

And I kissed her
on the forehead.

Her body was yellow.

And then the people
came to... take her away.

My dad told me to go downstairs
but... I didn't listen,

so I ran upstairs into my
parents' bedroom again and I

looked out the window.

And I saw my mom being
pushed into a black van.

And then it just went away.

So...

I'm so sorry.

Don't be.

Hey, so when am I gonna
meet my daughters' boyfriends?

you have met them.

No, I mean formally meet them.

You know, they're... they're
always avoiding my questions.

That's why we
don't bring them over.

Why are we even
talking about this?

Um, I... I signed up for
a... a dating site last week.

And I'm gonna go on
a date this week.

Don't you think
it's a little soon?

Sophie...


I don't.

I think this is what your
mother would want for me.

We're happy for you, Dad.

Really.

Thanks, Sweetie.

Can you... can you just
try and be more supportive?

I mean, how does a
person even move on so fast?

You know?


It doesn't feel that way to me.

Me neither.

You're serious?


Like, I feel like
this is a mutual thing.


Yeah.

I just... [sighs] I feel like
I've become dependent on you.

I just think it's good
to be alone sometimes.

So it's just a break, like
for a short period of time?

I mean, it's just a short
period of time and we most

likely will get
back together, so...


You sure this has
nothing to do with your mom?

anything to do with my mom.

The anniversary has
nothing to do with this.

[Ms. Baum] Eyes are closed.

Let's all take one
deep inhale together.

Fill your bellies and
let out an audible sigh.


[Ms. Baum] Yeah.

Hey, Sophie?

Lily here is gonna
give you a ride home.

What?

Um...

my sister is about
to pick me up, so...

I really think it's for the
best that she gives you a ride

home.

Um...
Oh.

Okay. [laughs]

Okay, great.

So, why did Ms. Baum
ask you to give me a ride?

you'd, um... you... she said that

you'd understand.

Understand what?


Are you okay?

[tearing up] I don't
know anything right now.

Okay, can you
please... can you pull over,

please?


Why are you crying?


I'm... I'm so sorry, Lily.

I'm really sorry.



What did you do? [laughs]

I don't know what to do.

I don't know what to do.

I don't know what I did.

I mean, you would... you
would think I would know,

right?

[both laugh]

Like, you would...

I...

I don't know.


Do you ever feel
like she's still around?

Um...

my sister...

um...

our mom communicates
with us in her dreams.

Sometimes I think that's true.

Hey, there.

Hey. [giggles]

What ya working on?

Um, chem project.

Oh, yeah?

Good.

Okay, well, lunch
is almost ready.

Dad?

Yeah, honey.

What's your favorite color?



You know, maybe, uh...

you know, maybe
it's forest green.


Why?

I... I didn't know Mom's
favorite color and I... I think

it's important
that I know yours.


Yeah.

Fuck me up!

â™ª â™ª

Wait, Lucy, please don't.

Oh, hell yeah!

â™ª â™ª

it, all of it, all of it!

I read a book a while ago about
how male gorillas leave fruit

out in the rain
for, like, months.

And then they lure the women
into drinking the stuff and then

they rape them.

Okay, Sophie, lighten
the fuck up. [laughs]

Oh, my God.

Jesus!
[Sophie] It's true, it's true.

sure it's true,

but we're not fucking gorillas.

We've evolved a lot
since then, my friend.

Sophie, I love you, like,
more than time can tell,

but I'm not gonna kiss you
for the third year in a row.

I'm gonna go fucking find a guy.

ask, but you do you.

[Claire] Okay, I love you!
[Sophie] Okay.

Oh, my God.

â™ª â™ª


Wait, Sophie.

What... what's going on?

Um, nothing.

Sophie!

Aren't you together?

We're fine, we're
just taking a break.

Okay, whatever that means.

It's fine, he's his own
person, he can do as he pleases,

you know?

Like, he's his own...

You're staring.

I'm not staring, I'm only
staring because you brought it

up, so...
Okay, okay.

Okay.
Keep... keep saying that.

Yeah.

It's fine.

Oh, my God.


Sophie!

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Sophie!

Sophie.

Um...

what are you doing?

I'm going home.

What does it look
like I'm doing?

Um...

are you okay?


I'm just... I'm going home.

Like, why are you following me?

I'm not following you.

I mean, you just
looked upset so I...

I... I'm not dating
Kate, if that's...

I didn't even care.

I didn't even see you.

Oh, okay.


Okay?

Okay.

I just really want
to go home right now,

so...
Why?

'Cause I just
don't want to be here.

I don't want to be doing this.


Doing what?

I haven't d... I haven't...

I'm not... it's not about...
I'm not talking about you.

I just really want
to get out of here,

so...

What, do you think I'm...

Do you... do you need me to
drive you home or anything?

Do you need a ride?
You think I'm drunk?

I'm fine, okay?

I'm not gonna get
into my car and,

like, crash into a
pole or something.

I didn't say that.

Okay.

Well, I'm great, so you
don't have to worry about me.

Clearly.

You're fantastic.

All right.

Okay.

I'll see you back at
school or whatever.

happy New Year's.



Mm.
Mm-hm.

you guys like it.

[Aaron] It's wonderful.
Thank you for bringing it.

Oh, you're welcome.

I have to tell you the truth, I
really messed up the first time

around and had to
throw one away.


Well, it was worth it.

You did a great job.

I'm glad you like it.
Yeah.

Um, so Sophie, where are you
thinking about going to college?

Well... [sighs]

I didn't really go to any
of my classes in high school.

Um, so I'll probably be going
to the one with the 89 percent

acceptance rate.

Which one is that?

It's called, um, City
Island College in New York City.


You must really love big cities.

Mm-hm.

New York is way
too crowded for me.

Oh, I love crowds.

The bigger the better, you know?

[all laugh]

thinking about studying?

Well, um, I really
would love to study acting,

but my father over here would
like me to study something more

practical like
English or History.

Mm-hm.

I just... I think it's a good
idea to have a backup plan.

Yeah.

Yeah, always good
to have some plan B,

for sure.

Yup.

What about you, Denise?

What do you do?

Well, I teach
kindergarten but, um,

I actually really love to garden
and that's one of my hobbies,

and I actually
really like to sing,

too.

Oh, how lovely!


You should sing us a tune.

[all laugh]

Uh, I think the quiche is the
only thing I'll be contributing

today.

[all laugh]

Mm.

Well, maybe another time.

Sure.

She's actually a great singer.

She sings for you a lot, Dad?

[Aaron] No, not a lot but...
[Denise] [giggles]

bit of singing.

just... I just do it for fun.

Mm, nice.

So?

What do you guys think?

I liked her.

She was really pretty and nice.

Good.
Yeah.

Good.

What about you?

There's literally
nothing wrong with her,

so...

Well, I'm glad you liked her.

Yeah.
Good.

I'm glad she's
nothing like Mom.

What do you mean?

She didn't make me laugh once.

I'm gonna go clean up.

Okay, do you want our help?


Okay, thank you.
[Aaron] Sure.

[birds chirping]

Why did you do it?

Do what?

Tell everyone that I
tried to have sex with you.

I don't know, I...

I just... I've
liked you since, like,

the third... since, like,
the third grade and...

I guess [sighs] I just
wanted Kevin to know that...

That I liked you too?

Yeah.

I'm sorry, that's...

that's really fucked up.

should do this. [laughs]

What?

You want... me to kiss you?


Okay.

[both giggling]

Okay.

Can I have this one?


[Lucy] Why?
That's my favorite shirt.


It's my favorite because I only
wear it on special occasions.

That literally
doesn't make any sense,

but okay.


You're not doing it right.

Just give it to me.

I'm not folding
clothes in a right way?

you have to roll them.

I have to maximize the
space in my suitcase.

plenty of space.

I'm going to New York.

I'm going across
the country, okay?

It's far away.

I'm gonna miss this.

what? [chuckles]

Our fights, your

My annoying voice?

Yes!

Will you miss me?

Of course I'll miss you.


Yeah.



Of course I'll miss you.

Promise you'll call every day.


I'll call every day.

Don't worry.

I'll harass ya, woman.


Okay, show me how to do it.

It's very simple.

like a true master.

really quite simple.

You just roll it up.

[birds chirping]

Um...

so you're going to
ORU in the fall?

Yeah.

A full ride, so...

That's... that's impressive.

Thanks.

I heard about you and Riley.

That you guys...

that you guys kissed and stuff.

Well, uh...

we're not together anymore so
I don't really know why that

matters.

I miss you.

Really?


I really do.

I miss you too.

I, uh...

I think about you a lot.

What do you think about?

How you were there for me.
