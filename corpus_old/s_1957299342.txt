Come on! Let's go! Hey, they're shootin' at us!
We gotta ride outta here!

Hyah! Come on! Move!

Chuy, you couldn't hit them
if they were standing still.

Filthy miner.

Ha ha! Don't get up.

There's new boys blasting back
here. Let's go get Walt and Nate.

No. Let's go get his gold.

We can't go down there.
We'll be sitting ducks.

Those boys will hunker down
and shoot us stone dead.

Now we ambush.
Now let's go.

You boys finding any color
in these parts?

Little, I guess.

We ain't quite
really that sure.

I see a couple of nice pickers
on the front pan, though.

Is that a fact?

Claim jumpers!

Dynamite!

Not much here, jefe.
Maybe half an ounce.

When are we gonna
split the color?

Later. Gather up
everything you can carry.

Walt, get down from there!

You want me
for something?

We don't do the digging.
We let them do the digging.

Just trying
to find more gold.

You ride with me,
you do as I say.

You two strip the bodies.

What for?
All the gold is in the box.

I'll do it. No. Let them
strip the bodies.

You get back
to camp now, boy.

I want it to look like
the desperate Mimbrenos did it.

Someone told me once

that death is not
the end of a life,

but a doorway.

It feels like the end.

I just turned 18
when the cholera took my mom

and baby sister Clara.

Ma was supposed
to get better,

but then she got
the cholera anyway.

Pa was hoping Parson Jenkins
could come to the funeral,

but he and the missus were
both down with the cholera, too.

And Pa says we'd be burying
the Jenkins by next week.

I guess God don't cut no slack
for preachers, either.

I took to watching my brother
and two sisters as best I could.

The house sure is different
without Mama.

It seems empty
in many ways.

Sarah helps me with much
of the day-to-day stuff,

and for the most part
takes care of herself.

You can tell she wants
to be a grownup

and leave the kid stuff
behind,

but I keep telling her
to enjoy it while it lasts.

Katherine plays with Barker
or her dolls most of the time,

but she helps with
the chores if she can.

It's fun to watch
the two girls together

because they're
just so different.

And then there's Billy.
My, my.

Well, he likes rocks
and throwing rocks.

I don't know if it's just
a boy thing or what.

It's... It's real work
keeping him in line.

But he doesn't mind
getting dirty,

so I have him get
the water from the well

and gather wood for the fire,

and we get by and all.

But raising young'uns is
not a job for the weary.

We came to
the deserts of Arizona

because Pa heard of new gold
deposits that were being found.

So we hurried out
to the middle of nowhere.

All those crazy miners
would get up real early

and pan for gold.

They'd even have the women
out there in dresses

in the freezing snow melt
panning.

"Did you find any color?"

That's what they
call gold, "color."

Well, you're not gonna
find me out there

digging some random
holes in the desert.

I'd rather pluck chickens
and do laundry. I don't know.

Mama said I should
find me a man,

but I don't want some
dirty stinking miner.

Anyway, Pa,
he had the fever.

Gold fever.

Ma, I have some concerns,

but I don't want
to say anything

because I think people would
get upset at me for saying such.

I don't think the Lord
hears my prayers.

The Good Book says that the Lord is
a present help in the time of need,

but I don't see him
or hear him.

Not at all.

Just being honest.

I do miss you.

Mattie! Mattie!

Mattie!

Come help me with this pie!

I fear it'll burn if
we don't take it out soon.

Well, I gotta go
help Sarah.

I swear she's a worry wart
all the time, Ma.

I'll see you next Sunday.

Mattie!

I'm coming! I'm coming!

Oww! Oww!

Oww!

Oww!

Pa! Pa!
Mattie strapped me, Pa!

She strapped me hard!

She gave you some pretty
good-sized welts there, boy.

What'd you do
to deserve that?

Nothing, Pa!
I didn't do nothing.

Mattie just hates me.
You ought to strap her, Pa.

She's the one who needs it.
Strap her hard.

You strapped him pretty good.
Did he have a need for it?

He left the henhouse
gates open.

We lost some of
our best layers. Well, that's not good, but...

That was after he flipped over your
concentrate bucket and used it for a drum.

And that was before he put the lizard down
my dress and down my undergarments, Pa.

And pulled Barker's tail
and pushed me down.

Is that right, son?

And you know, he hasn't done
his chores for the last two days.

And you know Ma's rule
about the chores.

I ain't never got
strapped, huh, Pa?

It appears to me
Billy has a point.

See? You'll get yours
now, Mattie.

I hope he gives you
some big old welts.

You know, Mattie, I shouldn't have
left you to do any of the correcting.

Hand me the strap.

No, Mattie, no! Don't let
him take me to the woodshed.

Please, Mattie!

And no more lizards!

And don't push me down!

Well, what do you think,
Mattie?

All right.
Get on after them hens.

Come on, Barker,
help me find those chickens.

You weren't really gonna
strap him, were you?

Well, what do you think?

I think you're funny, Pa.

Oh, you do, do you?
Come here!

Ah, kids.

Old Parson Jenkins
should be proud of that, Jess.

Well, I reckon
when we get a new parson,

he'll make some
good use out of it, too.

Well, I'm sure he will, Jess.
I'm sure he will.

Billy!
Oh, I swear it, Billy,

you throw one more rock and that next
one's going straight at your head.

Now git!

Looks like you're doing a fine
job with them children, Mattie.

I think you're just a natural-born
to raise children, don't you?

I noticed your Pa is starting
to get some color back.

Yep.

Putting on some weight, too.

Uh-huh.

1-2-3, go!
Go, go, go!

Put on the bottom weight then.

Careful. Easy up now.

A little bit up
on that east end.

I got it.
I got it.

Easy up, now. Are you okay, Jake?

Yeah.
My hand slipped.

You know better.

Sorry, Zeb.

Looks like it was a good idea
to invite Zeb and Jake today.

Yeah, it looks like.

How's that new claim
working, Zeb?

Things are looking up.

Just you and Jake up there
taking of everything?

Yeah, it's a lot of work,
all right.

Appears to me you might be
needing a wife and some young'uns

to help you
with all that work, Zeb.

You wouldn't mind Zeb
bringing home a wife sometime

to help you with all the
chores, would you, Jacob?

Nah, I guess not.

Jacob and I
will be all right.

Besides,
I ain't home much anyhow.

That's a fact.

Well, Jake, it's a big
country out there,

and a man's gotta take
a looksee once in a while.

Bobbi Jo,
you better settle down.

Oh, I haven't seen
a man like that.

Oh! Bobbi Jo!
Oh, Bobbi Jo!

Oh, you're heavy, Bobbi Jo.

Praise the man upstairs
before we eat.

Heavenly Father, we humbly
approach this table, Lord.

We ask for your blessing
on this meal, Lord.

We thank you for all your
grace and mercy in our life,

and we dedicate this church
to you, Father.

First in Christ's name
we pray. Amen.

Amen!

Pretty good, huh? Good job.

Whoo!

Good day it was.

I think these beans
came out of Will's garden.

You want any green beans?

Hmm! Worked up
an appetite today, huh?

I noticed your pa has
picked his step up a bit.

Must be feeling a might
better these days. Yep.

Is that Zebediah Fulton sitting
over at the end of the table there?

Yup, it sure is.

Is he somebody special?

Could be, Sarah,
he could be.

Zebediah.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Go get some cider, Jake.

Be staking me a claim.

Sure, Zeb.

I hear you like to dance.

Sometimes.
With someone I know.

Name's Zebediah.

Zebediah Fulton, but all
my friends call me Zeb.

And how many friends do
you have, Zebediah Fulton?

Well, Mattie Springer
has a little spunk in her.

That's fine by me.

Fine by you or not,
I am who I am, Mr. Fulton.

Well, you knew my name. I've been hearing it
all day.

Is that so?

It is.

Well?

Well, what?

Are you gonna
ask me to dance?

I thought I already did.

No. You said
I heard I liked to dance.

Ain't that the same thing?

No, not to me.

Well?

Well, what?

Are you going to dance?

Well, that depends.

Depends on what?

On whether you're
asking or telling.

I see.

Well, I better ask you.

Then maybe I'll
give you an answer.

Would you like to dance,
Mattie Springer?

Why, yes, I would,
Zebediah Fulton.

It's about time.

You're welcome
to call me Zeb.

And you're welcome to call
me Mattie. All my friends do.

And how many friends
do you have, Mattie?

Well, my mama always said

if I could count my best friends
with one hand, then I'm fine.

Well, this was just grand.

Zeb and I courted
for a few months,

and finally he proposed.

Well, it was off to town to go
get supplies for the wedding.

I love going into town.

Just between you, me,
and the gatepost,

I like to see everybody.

People watch, you know?

And you always hear
the latest gossip

and news from all around.

I love watching the
stagecoaches come and go.

What do you mean,
there's no gold in this?

I know
there's gold in this!

I only looked at it because
you wanted me to assay it,

and I need my five bucks
for assaying it. Five bucks?

Well, you know,
I got the sign out here.

I'm an assayer. You come
to me because I'm an expert.

Uncle Benjamin and Aunt Mary

came to help do
some of the planning,

along with their daughters.

Now, my cousin Ellen is the
sweetest girl you ever meet,

and she was
very well finished,

coming from
a rich family and all.

Uncle Benjamin
worked for the railroad.

Ellen, however, I don't think
she's ever drawn water from a well

or plucked a chicken
in her life.

But the one thing
she could do is shop.

And if it was expensive,
she'd find it.

Oh.

Hello there, young ladies.
How are you today?

Oh, we're fine.
Isn't this beautiful?

Hello, Mrs. Tuttle.

Hello, Mattie.
You know, it's very rare

that I would even have
a dress like this in the shop,

but Brenda Lee's daughter
decided to elope,

and I was left with
this wonderful inventory.

Well, did you know that
Mattie just got engaged?

I did not know that.

Congratulations, Mattie.

Thank you.

Do you think she could
try it on, Mrs. Tuttle?

Well, it is quite expensive,

but I think it would
be all right.

Mattie, why don't you step behind
the screen, and I'll get the dress.

Okay.

So have you seen
Zeb's place yet?

No, but Pa has.

Well, what's it like?

Not sure.

Zeb and Jake's mama
died a few years ago,

so the house might be
a little rough.

But I'm sure they're preparing
for a lady to come in.

Uh-huh.

Oh, Mattie,
it's so beautiful,

as if it was made
just for you.

So, any mention
of a honeymoon?

Well, Zeb did say something about
taking a trip down to the Colorado River

to a special little place
he knows.

You're so lucky.

I wish I could find
someone like Zeb.

I'll want to hear
all about it.

Well, I think you ladies
have found the perfect dress.

It doesn't even
need altering.

Oh, really, Mattie,
it looks beautiful on you.

Pa, what do you think?

Oh, Mattie,
you look so beautiful.

Just like your mother.

Well, Pa,
it's awful costly.

I could pick out something else
or wear something from home.

Oh, no, no, no,
absolutely not.

Not for your wedding.
How much is it?

It's... It's fifty dollars.

Uncle Jess?

Fifty dollars.

But Uncle Jess, isn't she the most
beautiful bride you ever did see?

Fifty dollars?

But Uncle Jess, you only buy
a wedding dress once and all.

Fifty dollars?

You know, ever since Zeb
proposed to Mattie,

all she could do is talk
about her wedding dress.

Isn't that what girls
dream about?

I remember her mother
on our wedding day.

It's like it was yesterday.

I want Mattie to be happy,
but fifty dollars? That's...

That's just more
than I can do.

Go on, take it.

Just let me have one dance with her
at the reception in that pretty dress.

Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

to witness Mattie and Zeb

enter the wonderful life
of matrimony.

The best evening of my life.

All my family was there,

and everyone was
so happy for us.

And now it's off
to my new home.

I felt like a queen
going to her new castle.

This is our place.

Oh.

Welcome home, sweetheart.

Mm, mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

We ain't had much cleaning since
Ma passed on about three years ago.

Zeb and I ain't
too good at that.

Hmm. Say that again.

Ain't nothing a little soap
can't cure, right, Mattie?

As soon as we get
this place up to snuff,

you can get started
on some supper.

I'm starved.
How about you?

I'll go get you some firewood
and a couple chickens.

There's also some flour
and stuff out back.

And I'll get you
some cured bacon.

That'll be just fine, Jacob.
I'll get started in here.

Jake, you wouldn't mind sleeping
outside tonight or in your mine,

considering this being our
wedding night and all, would you?

Sure, Zeb,
yeah, I understand.

All right, go ahead and leave
it open. It's a nice night.

Married life is wonderful.

You learn a lot
about yourself

when you're so involved
with someone else.

Zebediah went on his
first prospecting trip

a few months
after our wedding.

I know miners have to go
where no one else has been

to get fresh claims.

And he would send me
telegraphs from time to time,

letting me know
how he was doing.

I have my friend Doris Mae
go and get 'em in town.

Sure I got a horse.
His name's Strawberry.

He's a good horse, too.
He's fast and strong. Well, that's nice.

It's such a lovely night
tonight. It sure is, ma'am.

Ma'am, don't let that cowboy
convince you as if he's got any money.

No.

Darling, where you going?
I'm still here.

Why, you wretched snake!

I ain't taking this
from you. You better slow down, boy!

You know you still
owe me money.

Ah, too rich for my blood.

So where are
we headed next?

Ah, I've got all kinds of claims
sprinkled well north of the Grand Canyon.

But not gold. Silver.

Silver?

Well, I hear silver
is wonderful.

I've even heard of prospecting your
way to riches within a year's time,

chasing those veins
that are just packed!

You from around here,
stranger? Up north?

Out west?

Utah has some hills that
no one has ever touched.

Just waiting
for some dry washes.

Not so friendly, I guess.

So once we head up to Nevada,
that silver will be everywhere.

We're gonna get rich quicker
than those gold boys down here.

All we need to do is head
up that Pass toward Tonophah,

and the silver will be
waiting for you.

You listening in
on our business, mister?

I bet you
he's a claim jumper.

Now, now, boys,
ain't no call for violence.

A man can't but overhear things,
especially in a place like this.

Tell you what.

You go ahead and buy a dance
with them nice ladies.

I gotta be getting on home.

Jefe, I'm bored up to death.

When are we going out again?

I got Nate out scouting.
He should be back any day.

Scouting? Where?

Down by Vivian mining camp.

We've been down
those parts already.

Besides, they have
a sheriff down there.

Yeah, but they ain't likely to be
far from some Mimbrenos in that area.

Mimbrenos? Yep.

They've been chasing some caballeros
down there by Kingman just recently.

And you want
to go to Vivian?

Chuy, your brain ain't got
but two speeds: slow and stop.

It don't matter
where the sheriffs are.

It don't matter
where the Mimbrenos are.

We can blame them Indians
for every raid in that area.

So Vivian is
ripe for the taking.

Just the way we like it.

Well, I'm gonna race you!

Jefe!

Who goes there?

Good job, Barker.

I guess you heard Zeb
come in this afternoon.

I heard.

Mmm. Smells good.

Look who showed up.

Looks good, too.

Mattie,
where'd you put my...

Any trouble?

No, no trouble. You?

None to speak of.

Ran into some Maricopa Apache
that weren't too friendly.

We came to an understanding.

Yeah, I bet.

Zeb, what...

Aw, it ain't nothing.

Trust me, they ain't
nearly as frightful

as those Mimbreno Apache I ran into
a few years back over in Texas Canyon.

Now, they were
downright inhospitable.

Zeb, why on earth do you tempt
fate like that for no reason?

Can't help myself,
Mattie.

Just born to roam,
I guess.

But I say I can outrun any
Apache in the territory.

But why take the chance?

There's no sense in it.

You have a house
to take care of and me.

I came home, didn't I?

And it looks like you and
Jake done a real good job here.

That's not the point.

Maybe I should leave y'all two
alone for a little while.

Maybe you should.

Well...

Well, what?

Well, why are you
acting like this?

I figured you'd be
happy to see me.

Why should I?

Because you're my wife.

And you're my husband.

Although it might be a bit hard
for anybody to tell.

Now, what's that supposed
to mean, Mattie?

It means that I'm tired
of waking up a morning

just to find you lit on another
one of your private adventures.

Just up and go
whenever you please,

not caring about
what I think or I feel

and not knowing
when you're coming back

or if you're
coming back at all! Now, Mattie...

Don't you "Now, Mattie" me,
Zebediah Fulton.

We are a family, and family
don't treat each other this way.

I didn't never hear
Jake complain.

Well, you ain't married to Jake,
and I ain't either.

But he's the one that gets the chores
done around here day in and day out.

And where are you?

What kind of husband are you? Now, hold your tongue, woman.

You got no call
to talk to me like that.

Pa would have slapped my ma clean
into tomorrow for raising her voice.

Well, I ain't your ma,

and I speak my tongue
as I see fit,

whether you like it or not.

That's enough, Mattie!

You are something else,
ain't you?

You surely are the
feistiest woman I ever known.

Just be careful
not to push me too far,

lest I forget
my gentleman manners.

And how far have you
pushed me, Zebediah?

I am your wife, but you have
yet to become my husband.

What's wrong, Zeb? She was a
little too much for you to handle?

Shut up, Jake.

Well, finally
the church was built,

and right at the same time
came the new parson,

Parson James.

He was a sweet man
and a great preacher,

but I was just as fond
of his wife Clara.

She was very smart
and ambitious.

She teaches me to speak
more proper English.

And we hit it off
right away.

Where's Zebediah? I
haven't seen him in a while.

Well, he's off up north
somewhere.

He heard there was some gold
in the Kaibab country, so...

I didn't realize
he ventured off so far.

Yeah, he goes
as far as he pleases

and whenever
he's feeling like it.

I see.

Oh, no, don't get me wrong. He's
not a bad person or anything,

and I'm still his wife.

Some men just have
a more difficult time

when it comes to
settling down than others.

Sad to say,
some men never settle down,

and a woman's got a responsibility
to take care of herself.

Oh, what do you mean?

I've been keeping the house
by myself since Ma died. Yes.

You do, Mattie,
but you have your Pa around

as the man of the house
for protection.

A woman has got to know how
to defend herself if necessary.

Yeah, with all this violence that's
been happening around here and all.

Mattie, let me teach you
something else besides English.

Oh, Lord forgive me.

Wha...

Is that thing loaded?

Is there any other kind?

Listen, why don't you and Jacob
come on over for Sunday supper?

All right, we'd love to.

Let's go.

The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

Of whom shall I fear?

The Lord is the stronghold
of my life.

Of whom shall I be afraid?

When evil men advance
against me to devour my flesh,

when my enemies and foes
attack me to devour my flesh,

they shall stumble and fall.

Though an army besiege me,
my heart will not fear,

though war
break out against me,

even then
will I be confident.

So nice of Jacob to take
time off on the Lord's day.

I wish Zeb would sit in
once in a while.

It'd do him some good.

Give him time, Mattie.

All right, Mattie,

hold it like this.

Aim right at the target...

and shoot.

Now, Mattie,
when you fire a gun,

you don't want
to pull the trigger.

You want to squeeze
the entire gun.

Well, praise the Lord.

Why don't you keep that?

Oh, no, I couldn't.

Honey, I got plenty of them.

Jacob, good morning.

How's it going? Good.

Got some more for you. Let me take a look.

You heard about them
claim jumpers and thieves

that had been spotted
by the Sacramento wash?

Yeah, I heard.

Getting mighty violent
out there.

Heard from your brother?

No, not in weeks.

Well, good to
see you, Jess. Swede.

Jess. Jacob.

Billy, can you get those
concentrates out of the wagon, please?

Hear anything from Zeb?

Not in weeks.

Is that a fact?

You heard about the Walkers?

He heard.

Jacob,
I've been hearing things.

What things?

You heard what happened
to the Walker women.

Yeah, I heard.
Makes me sick.

Makes us all
sick and afraid.

I still have
two girls with me,

and you have my Mattie
up with you and Zeb.

Just keep her safe, Jacob.

I will, Jess.
You have my word.

Hey, Jake.

Yes, sir?

I know... I know Mattie's
married to Zeb, but he ain't...

Zeb has just been busy,
Jess, that's all.

Zeb's a good man.

I don't mean anything by it.
It's just...

Mattie's my daughter, and I don't
want her to get hurt, understand?

I understand, Jess.

I got all the concentrates, Pa.

Here, let me
get that from you, son.

Thank you very much.

You hear about
those Mimbrenos? He heard.

Ain't no Mimbreno gonna raid
our house, ain't that right, Pa?

I hope not, Billy.
I hope not.

Strangest thing,
though. What's that?

The Mimbreno killed all the
people and burned down the house.

And what's strange about that?
They've been doing that for years.

They didn't take
the animals. What?

The animals.
I heard the sheriff say

that the chickens, cows,
pigs, all got left behind.

Mighty strange
for the Mimbreno.

How'd your ore do
at the assay office?

Good. Good enough
to keep me digging.

Won't Zeb be surprised?

I reckon.

He's proud of you,
you know.

I know.

You ever think
about tomorrow, Jake?

Well, tomorrow's Tuesday.

No, not tomorrow tomorrow.

Tomorrow in the future.

Do you ever think
about getting married?

Having a family
of your own?

I've thought about it.

Yeah, well?

And?

And I'm still
thinking about it.

Well, that's a good thing.

It's good to think
about those things.

What about you and Zeb?

What about us?

Are you...
I mean, is there...

Are we gonna have babies?

Yeah, I suppose. Whoa.

Someday when he's ready to
settle down and raise a family.

What if he never does?

I'm sorry, Mattie.
I shouldn't have said nothing.

Ain't none of
my business no ways.

No, it's not, Jake.

It's between
me and my husband.

Mattie!

Mattie!

Mattie!

Mattie, Mattie...

Oi! You shouldn't have
come home so soon. Jacob!

Mattie, get down!

Blow the crate, Mattie!

Are you the one causing all
the trouble in these parts?

Are there more of you
out there?

Speak up or you'll lose
that comfortable bench.

Answer me,

or you'll answer to God
right now.

It wasn't my fault.
I'm just a scout.

Scouting for who?

Lockett.

When he finds out
that I'm missing,

he's going to come
looking for you.

What's he want around here?

Gold. Same as everyone else,
minus the work.

You're gonna hang
for what you've done.

You understand?

Not unless Lockett
gets ahold of you first,

or your women.

Sheriff, can we speed up the
system of justice in this town?

I think that can be
accommodated in this case.

How about tomorrow...

morning...

early.

Damn mutt.

Who goes there?

Ho, in the cabin!

Don't shoot!
We're up from Prescott.

Been on the run
from some Mimbrenos.

What Mimbreno?

We didn't take time to ask!

We just need some food and some
feed for our horses, mister,

and we'll be on our way.

We'll pay for the supplies!

Billy, hold on to this
until I come back inside.

Sarah, watch your sister.

And nobody comes through that
door except for me, understand?

Pa!

No! No!

Let's go.

I'll catch them later.

We can't leave anyone alive.

Suit yourself.

No sense in running, girl.

You ain't gonna get far.

I got him.

Let's get out of here.

Jess! Jess!

Jess!

Jess! Jess!

No! No!

I appreciate you...

You know. I know.

All of them?

I found Jess
and little Katherine.

No sign of Sarah and Billy.

Indians?

Possibly, but it
could've been Commancheros.

Where's Zeb?

I don't know.

Probably far away
from here.

He'll come back
as soon as he hears.

Can you find
Sarah and Billy?

I'll do my best, Mattie.

I can't bear the thought
of losing them, too.

And with Zeb gone...

I know it's wrong
to think certain things,

but I can't help but wonder
what God's doing sometimes.

You know,
I've been thinking Jake.

About what?

I'm not doing much good
around here these days.

You only been back
a month, Zeb.

I know,

but I heard they found
some silver up in Nevada.

They say a man
could get rich overnight.

I figure it might be a good
time to grab us some new claims.

We've got claims
right here, Zeb.

And what about Mattie?

Well, you're here.
You can take care of her.

That ain't right, Zeb.

Look, Jake,
you know how I am.

I can't be tied down like this.
I just can't do it.

She ain't even over her grief
yet. It's been hard on her, Zeb.

You think I don't know that?
I'll make it up to her.

I'll have her come on up to
Nevada once I get set up and all

and take her away
from all of this.

When are you
gonna tell her?

Well, I was thinking
you could do that for me.

She's not herself right now.
She might not understand.

Coming from you would be
a lot easier on her.

Look, don't do that
to her Zeb, okay?

She has a right
to hear it from you. You, me, what's the difference?

The difference is that you're
her husband, and I ain't.

I know, but coming from you
would be a lot easier,

you not being
attached to her and all.

I can't do it, Zeb.

Just think about it, Jake.

You're my younger brother,
and I wouldn't ask

unless I thought
it was best for all of us.

Best for all of us
or best for you, Zeb?

All I'm asking is
just think about it.

He's gone again, isn't he?

Mattie, he was gonna
tell you himself, but...

No, he didn't.

The Lord seeks
the lowly and the meek.

It is something about
the character of God.

He is attracted to empty,

while people are
attracted to full.

The Lord wants the soul
that is poured out.

And sometimes to be poured
out, we must go through pain.

Away with these saints who
say if you had great faith,

you will not
go through anything bad.

But my question to that is,

if you didn't
go through anything,

how would you know
you have great faith?

It is the trial that
gives you your testimony.

Do not be thankful that you
were able to avoid trouble.

Be thankful that you were able to
stand in the midst of the storm.

Therefore, whoever heareth
these sayings of mine

and doeth them,

I will liken him
as a wise man

who built his house
up on a rock.

And the rains descended
and the floods came

and the winds blew
and beat upon that house,

and it did not fall because
it was founded upon a rock.

Notice that the scriptures
state that the storm will come

whether you be
righteous or evil,

for it is the trouble
that reveals the truth.

You are not going
to avoid all trouble.

Instead, it is your ability
to stand on the rock

that will reveal
where you built.

The work of ministry,

it never seems to end
in these parts.

However, my wife Clara and I
felt called to soon minister

to the nearby
Indian villages.

One thing I know,

whenever you're doing
the Lord's work,

you never know
what you're gonna find.

[no audible dialogue[

[no audible dialogue[

They're exhausted.

I guess I would be, too.

I should probably
head on out to the mine.

You could stay
in here, Jake.

Well, I'll be fine out there.

It's okay.
You take the bed.

I don't feel like
sleeping anyway.

It's your bed, Mattie.

Well, after Billy and Sarah
were home, I felt a lot better.

Life was worth continuing.

You think I could learn
how to mine gold, Jacob?

Yeah, I reckon.

It takes a lot of patience
and a strong back.

Well, I'm real strong
and patient.

All right.
Grab that chisel over there.

Gold tends to travel
in quartz, okay?

I found this vein
about a year ago,

and I've been chasing it
ever since.

Hey, Sarah, could you shuck
some more of this corn?

How do you want them cooked?

Oh, I don't know,
how about boiled?

That's boring.

Pa always liked it
roasted or creamed.

Yes, he did.

Your choice.

Um, roasted.

So can you get rich
doing this kind of stuff?

Oh, yeah. Here.

Chisel right down
that fracture, right here.

All right.

How does Jacob
like his corn?

Oh, he'll have it
any way it's prepared,

just as long as
there's plenty of it.

What about Zeb?

Well, let's see.

I guess I don't know
how he likes his corn

because he'd never been around
when we had any of it.

When is he coming back?

Whenever he feels like it,
I guess.

You miss him?

Of course I miss him.

Does he miss you?

I guess so.

Why all the questions?

I'm telling you, if you're willing
to learn and work real hard,

you can collect a fortune.

Gold is all around us.
We walk over it every day.

People hurting and complaining
about things they don't have.

They just don't see what's
available to them, I guess.

He give you a baby yet?

No! No baby yet.

Someday.

Someday soon?

Why don't you just
keep shucking that corn?

Come back here,
you claim jumper!

We're gonna get you!

I got you now, boy!

Where'd he go?

Let's back up.

Go! Hyah!

So what happens now,
Jacob?

What do you mean?

Me, Sarah, and Billy.

Can we stay here a while
till I figure things out?

What are you
talking about?

Well, Zeb's gone.

The mine's yours now.
I just figured that...

What?

Well, that you'd
want us to go.

Go? Why in the world
would you think that?

So you don't
want us to go?

No, Mattie,
this is your home.

You sure?

Mattie, you stay
as long as you like.

Sarah and Billy, too.

Thank you, Jacob.

And, Mattie?

Yes?

Never mind.

I'm so sorry, Zeb.

I'm so sorry.

Hey! Breakfast is ready.
Come on, you two.

We got a lot of
cleaning to do today.

I know.

And you need to get those
concentrates cleaned.

I know.

What are you doing today,
Jacob?

I reckon, I ought to head on
down to the assay office

and check on some
ore ratios and prices.

Can I come with you? Not until you get those
concentrates cleaned.

Mattie!

I still need to fix
that leak on the roof.

You think you can have those
concentrates done by the time I finish?

You bet I can.

Hey, you won't be out
after dark will you?

No, I don't think so.

Okay.

What's with you two?

Nothin'.

Sarah says you two are gonna get
hitched and have a passel of babies.

Uh, I-I better go.

Gonna go fix that roof.

I oughta tan
your hide good.

It was Sarah
who said it. I did no such thing.

Well, you're not too old for a good
strap across your backside, either.

You wouldn't.

Mattie, what's wrong?
I didn't mean anything.

It's just that I barely got
to know Zeb, and now he's gone.

I just don't know
what to do.

Mattie,
can I ask you something?

What?

Will you tell me
the truth?

About what?

Jacob.

What about Jacob?

I think he loves you,
Mattie.

No.

He can't.
I married Zeb.

He loves you just the same,
and I think you love him, too.

I can't. He's...

What's wrong with
loving someone,

especially when
they love you back?

What is it, Mattie?

Oh, it's probably nothing.

It's probably
just an old coyote

wandering too close
to the cabin.

Now, just stay in bed
and be quiet.

Where's Jacob?

He went to the mine.
He hasn't come back yet.

Maybe the Mimbreno
got him. Billy!

That's enough!

Now be quiet,
the two of you.

Ho! In the cabin!

Don't shoot now.
We're friendly.

We've been on the run
from some Mimbrenos.

We just need a few provisions,
and we'll be on our way.

Can you help us out?

Mattie, don't do it.

He's the one who killed
Pa and Katherine.

No, we don't open the door
at night, mister. No offense.

So just take what you need on
the porch and be on your way.

I don't blame you
being cautious, ma'am,

not with your menfolk
being gone and all.

Well, the men are
due back anytime now,

and you don't want to be
here when they come in.

They don't take kindly
to strangers.

So I've got a gun,

and I'll shoot the first man
who steps foot through that door.

Are you okay?

I was so...

Mattie, I was so scared. I know.

Shh. It's okay.

I thought
they got you.

No, no, they didn't get me. Good thing.

Yeah, good thing.

Sarah said dinner's
gonna be late again.

I guess that pie's taking
longer than she expected.

That's all right. I still gotta
show Billy how this rocker box works.

You're gonna be a good dad
one day, Jake.

Billy thinks
the world of you.

He's a good boy.

He's just a little
high strung.

Zeb used to be
the same way when...

Well, that was
a long time ago.

I loved him, Jake.

I know you did.

I guess you always will.

I will, just how I love
Ma and Pa and Katherine,

Baby Clara.

I'll always love them, even
though I can't see 'em anymore.

Yeah.

I brought you down here 'cause
I wanted to show you something.

I don't want to pretend
to know it all, but...

this is what I've learned.

God is the ultimate
prospector,

and at times,
he applies pressure to us.

Tough stuff just like the
water here in this rocking.

All the heavy good stuff
stays in the box,

and all the light, unusable
material washes off the top.

And finally,
after it's all said and done,

after all the pain, grief,
and the loss,

after you've let go of all your
bad habits and everything unusable,

the pressure stops,

the storm cease,

and you will be like
fine gold.

You'll be in
a place of destiny,

the right place at the right
time with the right one.

Are you the right one,
Jake?

Mattie, I...

Oh, God, forgive me,
but I do love you, Mattie.

I've loved you since the first
moment I laid eyes on you.

Always have.

Jacob...

I told you so.

Well, Ma, Pa,

life has had some
interesting turns.

I married Jacob.

He's such a ham.

You know that mine
he was digging?

Well, one day...

Whoo hoo hoo!

Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

Yee hoo hoo!

Aah! Mattie! Mattie!

He brought a big dirty rock
into my clean house

and set it on that table,
and my table broke,

so I gave him a smack.

But then he told me
what it was worth.

I gave him a big ol' kiss.

But most of all,
I wanted to tell you

that the Lord took me
out of my home

to discover who He is.

I've discovered that the Lord
is a present help

in the time of need,

and that he is able to get me
to where I'm supposed to be,

even through tragedy.

I'll always love you Ma, Pa,
Katherine, Baby Clara.
