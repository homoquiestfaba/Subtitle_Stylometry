Oh, jackpot.

Get the hell away from my cans!

-Them cans is mine.

Now, I done told you,
them cans is mine!

SHAWNA:
Summer. This one started out

just like the last one
and the one before that.

Taking the bus to the Quarter,

sneaking up onto some
bougie hotel rooftop

and watching my best friend
Pedro get a tan.

Um, when did you get all that?

Get all what?

Okay, what you need to do
is flaunt them shits.

Theyâ€™re way cuter than
those little mosquito bites

you was working with
last summer.

Youâ€™re not even
supposed to like boobs.

I never said I liked them, mami.

Why donâ€™t you get
some of this sun?

Iâ€™m not trying to get no darker.

SHAWNA: We didnâ€™t know it yet,
but this summer...

this summer was about to be

very, very different.

"Different" ainâ€™t even the word.

I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say
is this summer,

the summer my whole world got,
like, messed-up beyond belief,

the summer I got breasts,

that was the same summer
I fought vampires.

PEDRO: Ooh, Iâ€™m so excited
about tonight.

What you got going till then?

SHAWNA: Got to go see my mom.
Trying to roll?

To Ombreux? Mm, no, thanks.

Itâ€™s not that bad.

But it really is, though.

You excited about tonight?

Beaucoup cute boys.

Trades, you feel me?

Platinum Percyâ€™s spinning.
You love to dance.

Not in front of other people.

That why you didnâ€™t try out
for the dance team?

No, I didnâ€™t try out
for the dance team

â€™cause 90% of the girls
they pick are Creole.

Thereâ€™s a certain look.

Okay, that just means
ten percent ainâ€™t Creole,

-so thatâ€™s all you.
-

Since when did you become
a life coach all of a sudden?

Donâ€™t you have your own stuff
to figure out?

Like?

Like a full scholarship
to a great boarding school

with a nationally ranked
track team.

Yeah, but itâ€™s in Texas, though.

So?

So, if I leave New Orleans,

is it really even
New Orleans anymore?

Like, can this bitch survive
without me?

Oh, my God.

And whoâ€™s gonna be here
to educate your ignâ€™ant ass

about our cityâ€™s
magnificent history and culture?

Whoâ€™s gonna remind you
that we did not host

the countryâ€™s first Mardi Gras

but we did put on
the first opera?

And whoâ€™s gonna explain to you

why poâ€™boys got to be
on stale bread?

Okay, I get it, Professor.
You staying.

Plus, my family, you know.

So, this party tonight?

I donâ€™t have anything to wear.

Hell nah. No, you are not
backing out on me.

We show up together,
we leave together, and we dance

with as many cute boys
as we can in between.

What time we meeting?

Depends on when my dad
gets off of work.

What time, Shawna?

Like... 7:00-ish, maybe.

All right, bitch. 7:00.

Donâ€™t be late.

See you.

-

Yo. Whatâ€™s going on, partner?

my site to show me love...

Save the Ombreux!

Save the Ombreux! Thatâ€™s right!

OLD MAN: Youâ€™re never too young
to start fighting

for what you deserve.

If not now, then when?

If not us, then who?

ACTIVIST:
Save the Ombreux!

SHAWNA: If you wouldâ€™ve
asked me back then,

I wouldâ€™ve told you
these people are crazy.

Like, donâ€™t they have
anything better to do?

I mean, the Ombreux
was hardly worth saving.

Besides the fact that
it was falling apart,

this shit had basically become
a one-stop shop

for sellers and users.

If you werenâ€™t
slanginâ€™ or coppinâ€™,

you didnâ€™t have
any business there.

I was probably
the only normal person

who ever came out this way.

Or maybe not.

-Mm, thatâ€™s Chris Thompson.

Junior, popular, cool, fun,

and the absolute last person
I expected to see

walking into the Ombreux.

-

-

Come on. Come on.

H-Hey, Mommy.

I, uh...
I brought you some stuff.

Any money?

Iâ€™m not supposed to be
bringing you...

I just need to buy some Tampax.

What, I need permission from
your father to do that, too?

I know I put a dollar
in here somewhere.

Um...

Iâ€™ll just leave these here,
I guess.

Shawna, wait.

Iâ€™m sorry I hollered at you.

Itâ€™s just...

things your father put
in your head about me, they...

Iâ€™m better.

I-Iâ€™ve been better
for months now.

Well, then...

...maybe you could just
come home, then.

Oh, uh-uh.

Ainâ€™t that easy, baby girl.

You been watching my plants
while Iâ€™ve been away?

Jamal has.

And they ainâ€™t died yet?

Mm-mm.

He do know that zebra plant
need light all day?

Itâ€™s tropical.

-I miss you.
-

We all do.

I miss yâ€™all, too.

Hey, uh...

Yeah.

I look at these pictures
every night

and pray to Jesus
I can come home.

My friends say,
"Girl, sell that thing.

You know how much money
you could get?"

But I ainâ€™t never
gonna sell this.

Um...

You got any money for Mama?

Even just a dollar?

-

gold bottles, gold letters

Late Night with Letterman

the winning was better, man

STEVEN:
And dinner is served.

Hey, Jamal, go ahead and turn
off that music if you could.

JAMAL:
Dad, what is that?

That is a casserole.

Are you sure?

Sit. Eat.

-JAMAL: All right.
-

Dad, do you think maybe
Mom could come home soon?

I mean, maybe sheâ€™s better.

Or maybe she could be better
if she was here.

Your momâ€™s got some stuff she
needs to figure out on her own.

-If she cared, maybe sheâ€™d try
a little harder. -Hey.

She cares, all right?

Itâ€™s just, sheâ€™s been through
a lot since the storm.

The storm? Thatâ€™s her excuse?

Dad, that was like 15 years ago.

Yeah, well, sheâ€™s still hurting.

Lot of folks are.
Show some respect.

I saw Chris today, J.

-STEVEN: Whoâ€™s Chris?
-Just a boy.

-A boy?
-SHAWNA: No...

JAMAL:
A boy who ainâ€™t feeling her.

How you know?

â€™Cause Chris got
mad light-skinned

Creole girls with wavy hair.

-And?
-Look how dark you is.

You look like
Wesley Snipes with braids.

Jamal. You gonna give
the girl a complex.

JAMAL:
My bad. Sorry.

STEVEN:
Yeah, youâ€™ll be sorry all right.

You understand?

Youâ€™re gonna be sorry.

And you too young
to be worrying about boys.

Eat.

Both of you.

-"Creole girls." Ridiculous.
-

Wesley Snipes.

donâ€™t give me that, no

-

-

some more...

Excuse me.

when you wiggle low

wiggle low

wiggle low...

-What are you doing?
-Iâ€™m trying to help you out.

You look crazy, girl--
like, legit homeless.

You know, next time,
you getting ready at my house

so I can approve beforehand,
â€™cause just...

-Ew, no, no.
-Okay, okay, I get it.

SHAWNA:
It was him again.

Chris.

Those eyes, those lips.

Ooh, those muscles!

Even his hair was perfect.

Oh, my God. I admit it, yeah.

I was thirsty.

You got exactly 30 seconds to
go over there and holla at him,

or Iâ€™m not gonna talk to you
for the rest of the summer.

What are you even talking about?

Bitch, donâ€™t even try me,
â€™cause you know I ainâ€™t playing.

Pedro.

29, 28,

27, 26...

-Hey, what about...
-25, 24,

23, 22...

-CHRIS: Iâ€™m telling yâ€™all.

-Hey, Chris.
-We do this every weekend.

Saints game, I promise yâ€™all.
And then New Yearâ€™s.

Like, yâ€™all donâ€™t,
yâ€™all donâ€™t really understand...

Hey, Chris!

Hey.

Uh, hey. Do I know you?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, we met before.

Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m Shawna,
Jamalâ€™s little sister.

-Oh. Right.
-

Youâ€™re on the dance team, right?

-Mm-hmm.
-

Like, thatâ€™s really cool.

SHAWNA:
Um...

I think I saw you today
over at the-the Ombreux.

No.

Ombreux? Nah.

Nah.
-Yeah, it was definitely you.

Um, maybe, like,
around 4:00, maybe...

I said nah,
that-that wasnâ€™t me, man.

Okay.

Yeah, I just wanted to, um...

I just wanted to come over here

and just tell you
that I liked your shape.

I liked your shirt.
I liked your shirt.

Um...

yeah, I just...
I just wanted to come over here

and tell you that, so Iâ€™ll,
uh... Iâ€™ll see you around.

All right, Samantha.

Be easy.

PEDRO: Oh, you wonâ€™t
have to take me there.

SHAWNA:
 I was so stupid.

I shouldâ€™ve just stayed home.

Two big lessons from that night:

think before
you shoot your shot,

and never walk home alone.

Pedro.

Sorry to dip on you like that.

I just wasnâ€™t feeling
that party.

I probably shouldnâ€™t
have even come.

It was stupid of me to even
think that I could just...

Just...

You know what?
Just-just hit me back.

-Yo, help a brother out!
-

I donâ€™t...
I donâ€™t have anything.

SHAWNA: Why they always
asking me for money?

Dang.

-

What the...

Hey!

Hey, leave him alone!

SHAWNA:
His skin was freezing.

Felt like-- I donâ€™t know--
leather or something.

Cold leather.

-

-

Am I crazy?
Did that really just happen?

Was I bitten by a... vampire?

Vampires are for real?

I canâ€™t even believe
Iâ€™m asking that.

Sunlight, I knew, was bad.

I didnâ€™t want to turn
into a bat or nothing

while I was asleep.

So I decided it was best
to stay awake.

-

Youâ€™re up early.

Uh, couldnâ€™t sleep.

Nightmares?

Something like that.

Hey, what happened to your neck?

Uh, curling iron.

Who did this?

I did, I guess.

Youâ€™re too old to be tearing up
the house like this, Shawn.

Wait, wait.

Get some sleep, Shawn,

after you take down
the rest of this.

What?

Took me a minute to figure out
what to do, what to say.

I get how I wouldâ€™ve sounded.

Still, I knew what I saw,
and I knew what happened to me.

Hola, Shawna.

Back from the dead. A miracle.

You know, Iâ€™ve been
hitting you up, chica.

I know. I know.

Um, can we talk?

In private.

-Okay, no way.

Get off my iPad.
Go read a book or something.

See why I canâ€™t
leave this place?

-Everyone would be illiterate.
-

So, what did you want
to talk about?

Okay. If I tell you
what I have to tell you,

you canâ€™t call me crazy,

and you have to promise
to believe me no matter what.

-Youâ€™re freaking me out.
-Promise!

Dios mÃ­o. I promise.

Okay.

That night, after the party,

I was walking home, and, uh...

I got, uh...

-Spit it out!
-I-I got attacked.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

-Are-are you o... -By a group
of homeless vampires.

-Bitch, is you smoking?
-You promised.

Okay, uh, maybe I should
just walk you out.

No.

Look.

-It wonâ€™t heal right.
-

-What is that?
-I told you, I got attacked.

-Are you sure it wasnâ€™t,
like, a dog? -Hmm-mm.

Homeless vampires.

Shawna, mami, you probably,
like, blacked out

and had some, like,
crazy delusion or whatever.

You might got the rabies.

Homeless vampires.

Well, I guess that at least

explains why they bit you,
right?

What?

You looked extremely homeless
that night.

Hello. Iâ€™m joking.

-Thereâ€™s no... -No, they mustâ€™ve
realized I wasnâ€™t homeless.

Thatâ€™s why they let me go
and kept biting that other dude.

-What other dude? What?
-You know, the dude, the dude...

the dude thatâ€™s always begging
for change over on Benton.

Oh, you mean Mr. Ooh-Wee?

-Heâ€™s just a crackhead.
-Okay, well, homeless people,

bums, crackheads,
whatever you want to call it,

thatâ€™s who theyâ€™re after.

Well, if theyâ€™re after
crackheads...

If theyâ€™re going
after crackheads, then what?

Um...

OLD MAN:
And what goes in its place?

-WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
-OLD MAN: Mixed-use development?

WOMAN:
Thatâ€™s right.

OLD MAN: Thatâ€™s code for
"weâ€™re not invited."

This is it. This-this is...

PEDRO: Shawna, thereâ€™s
no such thing as vampires.

Mom?

What?

Where could she be?

Whereâ€™d she go?

Mom?

Mom. Mom.

Mom!

See? Sheâ€™s fine.

-Letâ€™s go.
-Listen, Mom.

You got to come back home now.

Okay? Weâ€™ll figure it out
later with Dad,

but it ainâ€™t safe for you
to be living like this anymore.

You-you need anything else?

Whereâ€™s your necklace?

You know what?

It doesnâ€™t matter.
Weâ€™ll come back for that.

Right now we just need to...

PEDRO:
Oh, my God.

That doesnâ€™t mean anything.

Y-Youâ€™re all right.

Look. Look. I got it, too.

See? See?

Iâ€™m all right.
We both all right.

Just because you got bit,

that doesnâ€™t mean anything.
I...

Cold leather.

Shawna! Watch out! Watch out!

-Oh, my God!
-PEDRO: Stop! Stop.

-Move! Move! Move, Shawna!

We got to move! Mami, mami, no!

Mami, no, no! Move!

SHAWNA
No. Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Mami.

-Mami, we got... we got to go.
-No.

SHAWNA: The cops didnâ€™t know
whether to call it

a homicide or a suicide
or an accident,

but I knew exactly
what to call it.

It was murder.

I didnâ€™t know who or what
was responsible,

but I was gonna make â€™em pay.

No matter what,
they were gonna pay.

-

SHAWNA: This is what
you wanted to show me?

An empty lot?

This is the house.

Was the house

where me, your mom and Jamal
stayed before Katrina.

Finally tore it down
a few years back.

And they cram us all down
on the floodplains,

knowing all they got to do
is wait for the next storm

just to press the reset button.

Itâ€™s not like weâ€™re much
better off where we are now.

Another big one hits,
weâ€™ll be in the same boat.

No pun intended.

Shawn, I brought you here
to talk about your mom

and how we should remember her.

Dad, we donâ€™t
have to get into...

No, no, we-we do.

Okay? Itâ€™s important.

You know, she was grown,
so ultimately,

sheâ€™s responsible
for her mistakes.

Lord knows there were
plenty of those.

But history matters.

It was so chaotic after Katrina.

The help she needed
just wasnâ€™t there,

and it never came.

Look, Iâ€™m not saying
things were perfect before.

Iâ€™m just saying
things definitely got worse.

And who knows how bad
it wouldâ€™ve gotten

if it wasnâ€™t for you?

-Me?
-Thatâ€™s right.

She was pregnant
when the storm hit.

She called you her miracle baby.

She said you saved her life.

And I think she was right
about that.

I had to hide it when she left
so she wouldnâ€™t...

Sheâ€™d want you to have it.

Uh, the police found that one.

Listen, Shawn.

Youâ€™ve got to be brave now.

This city, this world--
it takes bravery.

Okay?

SHAWNA: I needed to know the
rules of the game I was playing.

Lucky for me,
New Orleans is full of people

obsessed with monsters
and magic and stuff.

I reached out to
this white girl named Granya.

She hosted a vampire book club
thing in an abandoned church.

-Weird, but I needed info,

and Iâ€™d get it any way I could.

Anne Rice, huh?
Sheâ€™s from New Orleans.

Hometown hero.

Oh, my God, this must be what
McAdams Academy looks like.

What you mean?

PEDRO: Letâ€™s just say
Iâ€™m not super excited

about being surrounded by a
bunch of white folks from Texas.

Itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re gonna
roll out the welcome wagon

for an immigrant kid
from Mexico,

no matter how fine I am.

-GRANYA Okay.

-See you guys next time.
-Bye.

GRANYA:
Hey, you must be Shawna.

Iâ€™m Granya.

So, are you guys interested
in the world of vampire fiction?

Donâ€™t know much about fiction,

but I do have
some questions for you.

Thatâ€™s a very loaded question.

Thereâ€™s really no consensus

how someone gets turned
from human to vampire.

Okay, but can you just walk me
through some of the basics?

Well, thereâ€™s
the school of thought

that you have to be drained
of all human blood

and have it totally replaced
with vampire blood.

Ooh, or...

...thereâ€™s a line of thinking

that you have to be bitten
and the venom

has to overtake your system
and thatâ€™s all.

Sorry to interrupt yâ€™all,

but why do you meet
in a place like this?

Like, why not go
to someplace less weird,

like a library?

The girls like the vibe--
itâ€™s gothic--

and they give us
the room for free.

Oh, but youâ€™re not, like,
a witch or whatever?

Presbyterian.

Is there anything you can
tell me thatâ€™s, like, for sure--

narrow it down, why one person
would turn into a vampire

but another wouldnâ€™t,
even if they both got bit?

They have to die.

Thatâ€™s what all the stories
have in common.

So, to become a vampire,
you have to die?

If the character doesnâ€™t die,

I donâ€™t see how
they can become a vampire.

Theyâ€™d just be
a person who survived.

Okay.

And how can a vampire die again?

Besides, like, sunlight.

Well, I mean, sunlight
is highly debatable.

Trust me, mami, no, it ainâ€™t.

Uh, besides sunlight,
thereâ€™s fire and decapitation,

wooden stake through the heart.

Okay, and what if you wanted
to catch a vampire

but, like, just keep it alive?

Why would anyone
want to do that?

Yeah, Shawna, why would
anyone want to do that?

You werenâ€™t serious in there.

Mami, we almost died
last time...

My mom did die, â€™Dro.

What do you need me to do?

We need everything on this list.

Everything.

PEDRO:
Garlic, stakes and a Bible.

Shawna.

Except donâ€™t worry
about the silver chains.

I can take care of that.

Oh.
-CHRIS: Oh.

Um, hey.

My mom wanted me
to bring these to yâ€™all.

Red beans and rice.

Sheâ€™s sorry she missed
the repass.

Thanks.

Uh, come in.

You know, she said she used
to kick it with your mom

in the Calliope,

play spades and shit,
before they tore it down.

I ainâ€™t know that.

Yeah, me, neither.

I guess that sort of
makes us peoples.

-Guess so.
-

-Jamal around?
-Mm-mm.

Do, uh, they know
what went down yet?

Nah, not yet.

Do they think it was, like...

Did somebody kill her?

She wouldnâ€™t have
done it to herself.

Look, if you or Jamal
ever catch wind

of any nigga that mightâ€™ve had
something to do with it,

I got yâ€™allâ€™s back.

Mm-hmm.

Chris.

You for real about
having my back?

Yeah.

OLD MAN:
If they tear down the Ombreux,

what will we do?

Where will we go?

Theyâ€™re taking everything
from us:

our low-income houses,
our jobs...

What you think of that dude?

I think he crazy.

Maybe.

He ainâ€™t wrong, though.

-He ainâ€™t?
-Me and you, we lucky.

We donâ€™t got to stay
in the projects.

But a lot of people,
this all they got.

The Ombreux?

I mean, I guess.

Why you think
so many people left

after the storm
and never came back home?

Ombreuxâ€™s the last
of the bricks.

I mean, where people
â€™posed to live?

Well, like you said,

lucky for us,
we got another place to stay.

For now.

SHAWNA:
Did you get it?

-Uh...
-Chris, this is â€™Dro.

â€™Dro, this is Chris.

Uh, can I talk to you
real quick, mami?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Okay, what is he doing here?

Weâ€™re not exactly the strongest,
fastest people in New Orleans.

I hold, like,
three city-wide track records.

You know what I mean.

-Does he know about...
-Not yet.

Shawna, I really donâ€™t think
right now is the right time

for you to be making
a love connection.

Iâ€™m not making
a love connection. I-I...

So, uh, the guy that did it,
whereâ€™s he at?

Okay, I donâ€™t know
if he did it or not,

but he might know who did.

Same shit. Letâ€™s go.

SHAWNA
Right.

PEDRO:
Maybe we should just go.

Are you sure
dude even stays here?

How did you even
find out â€™bout him?

Just a hunch, I guess.

A hunch?

-

CHRIS:
Shit.

Probably just a...

...rat, right?

Maybe we should just go.

Geez, â€™Dro,
you always got to be...

-

-

CHRIS:
So you killed your own mom?

Yeah.

Well, no, I mean...

It-itâ€™s really whoeverâ€™s
responsible for making her...

A vampire.

Fuck.

Okay, you shouldnâ€™t
have brung him.

You donâ€™t drop shit
like that on people.

Heâ€™ll be fine.
I mean, itâ€™s just...

Itâ€™s just a lot
to j-just, like, process.

And what about our other amigo?

Time to get some answers.

MARVIN:
I donâ€™t know that damn woman!

Old Marvin never turned nobody.

-If not you, then who?
-Uh...

now, if I tell you,
theyâ€™re gonna kill old Marvin.

Again.

CHRIS: What makes you think
we wonâ€™t kill you, nigga?

For someone who hates himself,
you sure looked happy as hell

when you was about to chomp down
on a niggaâ€™s neck.

Oh, man, I...
I couldnâ€™t help it, bruh.

I ainâ€™t ate in days.

Whoâ€™s turning people
into vampires?

Oh...

Yâ€™all had garlic in there?

Yâ€™all-yâ€™all playing foul, bruh.

Donâ€™t-donâ€™t...
donâ€™t come no closer.

-Whatâ€™s it feel like?

You been tear-gassed
by the police?

No, but Iâ€™m guessing by
your nosebleed I donâ€™t want to.

Tell us what we want to know.

-

-Straight like that.
-Okay.

Okay, okay, Iâ€™ll tell you.

Just get that shit
away from me, man.

Itâ€™s this nigga named Lefrak.

He building an army.

-An army for what?
-I...

I donâ€™t know, but any homeless

or any addict down on his luck,
thatâ€™s who heâ€™s enlisting.

How do we get to him?

You canâ€™t.
He donâ€™t fuck with humans.

He got to eat, right?
Human blood?

Where does he stay?
Where does he stay?!

-

An old mansion
down in the French Quarter.

Heâ€™s always got that
red Escalade parked out front.

Truth be told,

I hope you get
Lefrakâ€™s bitch ass.

â€™Cause if he dies,

they say we all
turn back to normal.

You think thatâ€™s true?

Too bad you wonâ€™t
be alive to find out.

-Huh? -We let you go,
next thing you know,

we up on some vampire hit list.

Oh, no, no.

How you kill
one of these bitches?

Wait. Hold up.

No one said nothing
about no murder.

I think we use a wooden stake.

-PEDRO: What?
-What?

Shawna, what are you doing?

Chris is right, â€™Dro.

We canâ€™t have him snitching
before we get to Lefrak.

Get to Lefrak? Mami...

-

I ainâ€™t gonna drop
a dime on you, baby.

Old Marvin
never turned on nobody.

SHAWNA:
I have to get to Lefrak, â€™Dro.

And if this works,
Iâ€™m-a put a stake

-right through his heart, too.
-Come on, bruh.

Yâ€™all canâ€™t do me like this.

-Through the heart, right?
-

Guys, letâ€™s just
think this through.

Yeah!
Letâ€™s think this thing through.

-I untie you right now...
-Shawna.

...tell you
you can have every drop

of his sweet Mexican blood,
what you do?

I told you.

SHAWNA:
Wait.

This is my beef.

I should do it.

You sure?

No, not really.

But I gotta.

Get him, then, killer.

PEDRO:
Shawna.

Come on.
Do you really want to do this?

-

-

Hmm.

Huh.

Hmm.

Yo, can I holla at you
for a second?

Look, I donâ€™t do surprises,

especially not surprises
about monsters and shit.

Look, Iâ€™m sorry.

Look, obviously,
it wonâ€™t ever happen again.

Give me your phone.

Whatever yâ€™all do
to this Lefrak cat...

SHAWNA:
Dang. He fine even when he mad.

...I want in.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, o-okay.

Iâ€™ll call you.

SHAWNA: Lefrakâ€™s mansion
in the Quarter-- check.

Lefrakâ€™s red Escalade
parked out front-- check.

Me getting inside and putting
a stake through his heart--

to be determined.

Why are you staring at me, punk?

What?

You know, I researched
this house some.

Anything that can help us
get to Lefrak?

No, but some pretty cool
history stuff.

-About?
-What have I told you is

the alpha and omega of
this here New Orleans history?

Slavery?

The man who built this house,

one of the most notorious
slave owners in Louisiana.

Little bitch owned
400 slaves at his peak.

-Ugh.
-Savage.

He must have really loved it.

Held on to the bitter end.

Built an underground
tunnel system to hide

his slaves from Union soldiers.

Yeah, history. Cool.

Okay, can we focus on the now?

All right, well,
itâ€™s getting late.

-The sun is gonna go down.
-Uh-uh. Weâ€™re never gonna

see nothing if we leave
every day before dark.

Theyâ€™re vampires. Duh.

Mami, you know
what could happen.

Stop acting
like such a girl, â€™Dro.

Okay, fine. If you want
to stay, thatâ€™s fine,

but donâ€™t expect me to put
my fine Mexican ass on the line

â€™cause you want to act
all stupid.

-Iâ€™m leaving, for real.
-Okay.

And donâ€™t even try to stop me.

Bye.

I canâ€™t believe
weâ€™re doing this.

Thatâ€™s the third pair
to come out of there tonight.

Vampires like hos.

So what?

SHAWNA: I had a plan,
but I needed another girl.

I knew just the person
crazy enough to do it with me.

In fact, she went straight
SAT prep mode on my ass.

GRANYA:
So, this one says itâ€™s possible

for some vampires to use

psychic mind control attacks
on their victims.

So...

So, doesnâ€™t that explain why
the ladies of the night...

-Ladies of the night?
-The prostitutes.

Oh, the hos. Right.

Lefrak probably used
some kind of mind control

to make them forget
about the feeding.

Makes sense.

Okay, but if he uses that on me,
Iâ€™m a goner, right?

Not exactly.

I read up
on psychological attacks,

and I came across
this military study

from, like, World War II.

Okay. And?

If Lefrak tries
to hypnotize you or whatever,

just, you know, remember
something from your past

to keep you in the real world
and out of dreamland.

So I just need to think
of a memory?

-Thatâ€™s it?
-Thatâ€™s it.

Hey, do you think
Iâ€™ll meet a cute one?

I cannot believe Iâ€™m doing this.

I canâ€™t believe
Iâ€™m on this side of town,

in this store, doing this.

I take it this ainâ€™t
your typical afternoon activity.

Uh, no.

My parents keep my itinerary
pretty full.

With what?

With diving, chess, debate team,

Model UN, drama.

Oh, and Mandarin and French.

And like a thousand other things
Iâ€™m probably forgetting.

SHAWNA:
Weâ€™re gonna need some makeup.

So, while me and Granya
worked on our entrance plan...

We got pizza,
extra garlic powder.

SHAWNA: ...Chris and Pedro
worked on our exit plan.

And I worked on
the plan of attack-- alone.

Even with help,
it was pretty nuts

to think I could pull this off.

Iâ€™m not Buffy.

Iâ€™m just--
I donâ€™t know-- Shawna.

But I wasnâ€™t about
to give up now.

Night before, couldnâ€™t sleep.

Day of, couldnâ€™t eat.

STEVEN:
All right, headed out.

-Where are you going?
Oh.

What are you doing?

What does it look like?

It look like you giving up.

Dead is dead, Shawna.

Donâ€™t stay out too late.

Okay, are we good
with the getaway plan?

-Yeah.
-Letâ€™s do it, then.

Wait. I actually need
someone to help me

tape the stake to my leg.

Um, okay. Can you hold it?

Thanks.

Why doesnâ€™t mine look like that?

Fashion 101, mami:
big risk, bigger reward.

I couldnâ€™t figure out
where to hide it

â€™cause thereâ€™s not much room
for a stake, but...

I was thinking maybe my leg...

Iâ€™ll do it. Okay.

Too tight?

Perfect.

-Hey, I have a question.
-

I know why Pedroâ€™s helping me.

Heâ€™s my best friend.

And Granya, well, sheâ€™s, like,

obsessed with vampires,
so itâ€™s a no-brainer, but...

you I donâ€™t really get.

I mean, Iâ€™m-Iâ€™m happy
that youâ€™re doing it.

Just, um...

why?

Letâ€™s just go kill
some vampires.

Okay.

SHAWNA:
This was it.

I didnâ€™t have time to
figure out why I had a stalker.

Revenge was just
a few steps away.

-GRANYA: Wait.

I donâ€™t want to do this.

-This is a horrible idea.
-No, itâ€™s too late.

-MAN: Yeah?
-

I get it.
You looking for Lefrak.

You got your days mixed up.
Come back Thursday.

Uh, we were told
to come tonight.

You know what?

I thought yâ€™all had money,
and we were really ready

to get down tonight,
so just forget it.

We donâ€™t have time for no games.

-MAN: Hold up.

Yâ€™all are too young...

and too delicious
to let walk away.

Yâ€™all go chill inside.

Iâ€™ll see if Lefrakâ€™s ready.

Mmm.

-

OLD MAN:
I was once on the bottom, too.

But now we all have new life.

Weâ€™ve been reborn.

This time on top.

Those days of us
being pushed aside,

forgotten and abused--
well, those days are gone

so long as youâ€™re willing
to fight.

-Fight back!
-

We must...

Just make sure that
you take them all with you.

Be hungry.

-Are you with me?
-OTHERS: Yeah!

All right.
Who wants to go first?

Come on, then.

Lefrak is ready for you.

-I usually donâ€™t like my girls
as dark as you. -

Sorry.

What you lack in beauty

you more than make up for
in youth.

And I like â€™em young.

No silver.

SHAWNA:
Cold leather.

Yo. Theyâ€™re in.

-Got the garlic powder?
-Yeah.

All right, letâ€™s get this pumped
through the windows.

Ready?

Donâ€™t be scared.

-I ainâ€™t.
-Mm.

I...

I need to use the bathroom.

LEFRAK:
Hurry up in there.

Donâ€™t we need a rubber?

Not for what Iâ€™m about to do.

Look deep into my eyes.

SHAWNA:
Mind control.

Relax.

SHAWNA:
I needed a memory.

I needed a memory quick.

You wonâ€™t remember me.

You wonâ€™t remember.

Do you know where you are?

I canâ€™t remember.

What is going on here?

OLD MAN:
Get Lefrak!

-

Come on.

She did it. Come on.

Who are you?

Iâ€™m Deniseâ€™s daughter.

Who is Den...

-She good?
-You okay?

-Oh, no.

Get back!

Go. Go. I got it.

-CHRIS: You all right?
-SHAWNA: Yeah, I guess.

CHRIS:
Letâ€™s bounce.

Come on. Letâ€™s go. Letâ€™s go.

Four children
are leaving the house.

Bring them to me.

Dead, alive-- I donâ€™t care!

It doesnâ€™t matter!

Yo, Chris. What you doing here?

Iâ€™m with Shawna.

You guys sure you donâ€™t
want to take a shower?

We have plenty of clean towels.

Shawna, did you know
that Pedro got into

McAdams Academy in Texas
and heâ€™s not gonna go?

-Mm-hmm. -Thatâ€™s, like, one of
the top schools in the country.

I wouldâ€™ve killed to go there.

Look, I belong in New Orleans
and nowhere else, okay?

It ainâ€™t that deep.
He just scared of white people.

Fair enough. White people are
sort of terrifying. I get it.

Iâ€™m not scared.

Letâ€™s just stay focused
on vampire stuff.

CHRIS: Well, I guess we know,
if you kill the leader,

shit stays the same.

Except maybe we didnâ€™t
kill the leader.

Let me see those pictures.

There he is.

Thatâ€™s the street preacher
from the Ombreux.

Yeah. Heâ€™s operating
out of the same house

he was a slave in.

Thatâ€™s sort of poetic.

Okay, so this little bitch is

a crazy street preacher
and an ex-slave vampire.

That doesnâ€™t mean
heâ€™s the leader, though.

No, but the way
he was talking in there.

His whole-- I donâ€™t know-- vibe.

-I think he was in charge.
-CHRIS: Could be.

Okay, b-but we took
our only shot, mami.

Not like we can
go back there now.

Damn, Shawna,
whatâ€™s your problem?

-Okay.
-

Okay, wh-what...
what should we do?

-Calm down.

If itâ€™s them, they canâ€™t come in
unless we invite them.

-"Them"?
-We should go.

-Go where?
-

Go away!

-Itâ€™s okay. They canâ€™t come in.
-

Should we jump out the window?

Out the window? What the fuck
is wrong with yâ€™all?

-Yâ€™all smoking or something?
-Are you guys even listening?

There are rules.

-They canâ€™t come in.
-We got stakes.

-Stakes? What...
-

I said go away!

-Go! -Oh, shit!

-CHRIS: Jamal!
-Oh, shit!

Jamal!

GRANYA:
This canâ€™t happen!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

-

-

-

CHRIS: Yo, Granya, I thought
you said they couldnâ€™t come in.

GRANYA:
Sorry.

Say, bruh, one of yâ€™all
better tell me

what the fuck is going on.

SHAWNA:
Turns out my cabbie stalker

goes by the name of Tunde.

At 800 years old, he was

one of the oldest vampires
in the world.

Tunde told us
there are several covens

and heâ€™d been at war with the
street preacher named Babineaux

for over a century.

Tunde told us that Babineaux
was once a slave in the city.

-

That heâ€™s seen
the worst in humanity.

-

One night, he was attacked
by a vampire...

-

...and turned.

Babineaux took power
into his own hands

and killed his master.

And from the ashes
rose a new power.

After Katrina, he became worse.

And as the gap between
the haves and have-nots

-continues to grow...
-

he believes
itâ€™s time for action.

Heâ€™s been building an army
right under humansâ€™ noses,

seeking the down-and-out
and turning them into soldiers,

as he thinks
they will not be missed.

Babineaux is
a vampire supremacist,

one of the last coven leaders
to think this way.

He looks at humans
the way a lion does a gazelle.

Just prey.

Um, if you a vampire,
how come you ainâ€™t eat us?

With modern-day technology,

it is archaic to eat humans.

So, why were you watching me?

I was there to observe
Babineaux.

You were just
a curious variable.

And the sun?

TUNDE: The sun is
a nuisance to new vampires.

It hasnâ€™t affected me
in about 500 or 600 years.

Survival in the daylight
is possible with time...

and melanin.

Only vampires
with an ample supply

can endure the light.

Itâ€™s like a superpower.

Then youâ€™d make
a good vampire, then, Wesley.

Why do you call her that?

â€™Cause she mad black
like Wesley Snipes.

When I was a boy,

long before I was like this,

in my village,

there was what
you might call a princess--

the chiefâ€™s daughter.

Her skin was as dark
as the nighttime ocean.

All of the other girls
were envious

and spent hours in the sun

trying to look just like her.

She was the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen.

You are not unlike her.

Your brother
or anyone in your presence

should consider themselves
very lucky.

I agree with Tunde.

Youâ€™re beautiful.

PEDRO:
Yeah. Me, too.

Itâ€™s your sister, dude.

I missed the fight!

TUNDE:
Yakubu...

while Iâ€™m away,
watch over these children.

Watch us? Where you going?

Iâ€™m going to put an end
to Babineauxâ€™s antics.

Okay, if youâ€™re getting
Babineaux, I want to go.

Shawna, what you did
with Lefrak was very brave.

But it was also
incredibly foolish.

You have disturbed
an uneasy peace.

Stay with Yakubu.

Heâ€™s strong and trustworthy.

He will keep you safe
until the morning.

You canâ€™t cut me out of this.

You are no longer part of this.

Mm-mm.

I brought you two forks
so you could share.

CHRIS:
What is that?

I donâ€™t know. Dad made it.

Yeah, I think maybe
Iâ€™ll take that shower after all.

I think Iâ€™m good.

My brother.

Huh?

Earlier, you asked me
why I wanted to help you.

My brother.

Heâ€™s on that stuff,
just like your moms was.

Oh.

Wait, so I did see you
over at the Ombreux.

Itâ€™s embarrassing.

Is your brother, um...

I mean, did he get
turned into a...

A vampire? Nah.

He came home last week.

Not sure it really matters,
though.

What you mean?

I donâ€™t know who to be mad at:

Kelvin...

dealers, crooked-ass cops,
my folks.

But you,

you got somebody
to take it out on.

I guess I...

sort of wanted in on that.

Guess it makes me
sort of selfish...

No, it donâ€™t.

I understand.

I thought you might.

I meant what I said earlier.

Youâ€™re beautiful.

I am, arenâ€™t I?

Yo, and humble, too.

Â¡Ay, Dios!

-Oh...

Heâ€™ll be all right.

-

Babineaux is not here.

-

Itâ€™s been too long.

-Yeah.
-Weâ€™ve been waiting.

That was Tunde.

Did they get Babineaux?

The coward is hiding somewhere.

So, what are we supposed to do?

Wait until they find him.

Itâ€™s shaping up
to be a long night.

CHRIS:
So, where did Babineaux go?

He couldnâ€™t have gone far,
right?

The tunnels-- under the mansion.

If they were built
to hide slaves,

Babineaux would know about them.

-We should tell Tunde.
-CHRIS: We should go.

What? Chris.

I have extra stakes
under my bed.

Shawna.

Listen, â€™Dro, if you donâ€™t
want to go, itâ€™s cool.

Youâ€™ve done enough already.

Shawna, you know
Iâ€™ve supported you

in every crazy thing you wanted
to do since your mom passed.

Trust me when I say this is
the worst idea of them all.

Give me a stake.

Iâ€™m going to that
boarding school in Texas.

I mean, if we make it
out of this shit alive,

-then yeah, Iâ€™m going.
-

I just... I figured,

if you can fight vampires
over the summer,

then I can deal with a bunch of
white folks for a couple years.

And I-I deserve it.

Family will be fine.

Youâ€™ll be fine.

But if I donâ€™t go, I wonâ€™t be.

Donâ€™t worry,
Iâ€™ll come back and visit

-your trifling ass
for Carnival. -Oh, shut up.

What yâ€™all doing?

Weâ€™re gonna go get Babineaux.

For Mom.

Hey, Yakubu?

What is it?

-JAMAL: Go!

Go, go, go!

We got to hurry.

-I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going.
-What?

Why not?

Vampires arenâ€™t
so much fun in real life.

Yeah, I guess they ainâ€™t.

SAT prep sounds pretty good
right about now.

SHAWNA:
Thanks.

For everything.

Okay.

GRANYA:
Good luck.

Go kick some vampire butt
for me.

-Yo. Get down.

The tunnels.

-

-

You missed!

-No. No, no, no.

-No. Shawna, Shawna!
-BABINEAUX: Feast.

Shawna, help me! Help me!

SHAWNA:
No, Pedro!

-Pedro, no.
-

Pedro.

Chris.

Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.

-

I only want to talk.

Only a loss could make you
this determined, this angry.

Who did you lose?

My mother.

You stole her from me.

I gave your mother power!

I gave her a shot
at immortality.

-It was a gift.
-A gift?

Sheâ€™s dead.

Well, every great struggle
has its martyrs.

What?

They put us down,
they-they kick us,

and then they wonder why we
havenâ€™t gotten up on our own.

Iâ€™ve watched it for centuries.

I saw it when we were in chains.

I saw it when we were
in the back of the bus.

I see it now as they push us
from our homes.

But why? I mean, why now?

This is the beginning
of the end for us in this city.

The Ombreux was the last straw.

-What? -When Katrina
didnâ€™t swallow us up,

well, they... then they turned
to development.

Soon, there wonâ€™t be enough
of us left to band together.

Band together?

I mean,
youâ€™re-youâ€™re a murderer.

All the protests weâ€™ve had,
all the marches weâ€™ve done.

People want to make
a difference.

You couldâ€™ve just convinced us
to just fight with you.

The marches,
the protests, the riots.

Slave revolts. Iâ€™ve seen it all.

1859, 1968, 1992, 2020.

All bright flames
that suddenly got snuffed out.

But when youâ€™re immortal,

you get to watch
the whole big picture.

You learn how to stoke
the flames,

to keep it burning.

Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing.

Youâ€™re sick.

You should just give up now

â€™cause Tundeâ€™s already
destroyed your army.

Iâ€™ll just have to build
another one, wonâ€™t I?

I mean, this is New Orleans.

Thereâ€™s never gonna be
a shortage of the down-and-out.

I have nothing but time.

You... No.

You could join me.

You could... you could
actually lead by my side.

Someone with your ability,

with your determination--

youâ€™d be a powerful vampire.

Your skin.

Youâ€™d be day-walking
by tomorrow.

You...

You could help.

You could actually
right the wrongs

that gave your mother the
problems she had to deal with.

Iâ€™d rather die.

-

-

It tastes so much sweeter

when itâ€™s against your will.

Eat this!

-

This is for my mother.

CHRIS:
Shawna.

No, no. Pedro, Pedro.

Pedro, Pedro, Pedro,
itâ€™s gonna be okay.

Pedro, itâ€™s gonna be okay.
Just c-come on.

Just stay with us.
Pedro, Pedro, stay with us.

Pedro, no. No, Pedro, please!

Please stay with us!

Pedro, please stay.

Please stay!

Pedro, no.

No. Please!

SHAWNA: Remember what I said
about my world

getting messed up beyond belief?

Yeah, well, that doesnâ€™t even
begin to cover it.

But Pedro always
used to say to me...

heâ€™d say,

"Mami, hell no. Iâ€™ll call
the fashion police on you,

and they gonna give you a
life sentence for that outfit."

You know what else he said,

like, when I would get sad
or whatever?

Nothing.

He didnâ€™t have
some inspirational quote

to cheer me up.

Heâ€™d just crack a joke,
and next thing I know,

weâ€™d be laughing and smiling
and barely remembering

what we were sad about
in the first place.

So thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m gonna do.

Iâ€™m gonna smile.

So that was the summer

I got breasts
and fought vampires.

I lost my mother
and my best friend.

But I gained some people, too.

Life at home with Jamal
had never been better.

You look pretty today, Shawn.

Just like Ma.

Thanks.

Granya and I became
friends for life.

She even convinced me
to try goat yoga.

Hey. Would you like
to sign our petition?

Babineaux was wrong
about a lot of things,

-but some things are worth
fighting for. -Okay.

-For my family...
-Hello.

-...my community... -Would you
like to sign our petition?

-...for myself.
-Cool. Okay.

-And of course, there was Chris.
-Sign right there.

Duh.

CHRIS:
Aâ€™ight, so I handed out

-a bunch of pamphlets.
-Mm-hmm.

-Iâ€™m gonna head out.
-You leaving?

I got to bring my brother
to this addiction meeting thing.

I said Iâ€™d be there.

But you still want
to kick it tonight, right?

How about...

you go pick us up a pizza,

and then we meet
back at my place?

What about your pops?

As long as you leave
before morning.

Oh, Chris...

extra garlic.

Jamal? You here?

Or do I have
the whole place to myself?

Including the bedroom?

Chris, did you remember the...

PEDRO:
Hey, mami.
