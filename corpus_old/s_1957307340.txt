Man:
<i>As scientists</i>
<i>continue to wonder</i>

<i>what caused this</i>
<i>all to happen...</i>

<i>(overlapping dialogue)</i>

<i>Scientist believe</i>
<i>that with proper care</i>

<i>and consideration...</i>

Woman:
<i>...following our exclusive</i>
<i>well-used network...</i>

<i>(overlapping dialogue</i>
<i>continues)</i>

Man:
<i>...what officials fear</i>
<i>is becoming an epidemic.</i>

Woman:
<i>And welcome back to WNN.</i>

<i>I'm joined with my two guests</i>
<i>here in the studio today.</i>

Man #2:<i> You tell me</i>
<i>why he disappeared.</i>

Vision on.
<i>(chime)</i>

Woman:<i> Well, maybe</i>
<i>we were too hard on him.</i>

<i>Too invasive.</i>

Man #2:
<i>He became a celebrity,</i>
<i>for god's sake.</i>

<i>He probably makes</i>
<i>more than all of us combined.</i>

Man #2:<i> Boo-hoo.</i>
<i>Woman: Hold on.</i>

Progress out.

<i>(chime)</i>

Man #2:<i> Come on.</i>
<i>If you were in his shoes,</i>

<i>with the cameras following you</i>
<i>and people always in your face,</i>

<i>don't you think</i>
<i>you'd disappear too?</i>

<i>I mean, think about</i>
<i>all the aggressive fans</i>

<i>and the stalkers</i>
<i>who really affected him.</i>

<i>The man is an exception.</i>

<i>Exceptional.</i>

<i>If you saw</i>
<i>a white tiger in the woods,</i>

<i>you'd follow it, right?</i>

<i>You'd poke him,</i>
<i>try to take a picture.</i>

Woman:
<i>Okay, forgive me.</i>

<i>But you do realize</i>
<i>you're talking about him</i>
<i>like if he was an animal.</i>

Progress out.
<i>(chime)</i>

Woman:
<i>Today, on Star News,</i>
<i>we haven't--</i>

Progress up.

<i>(chime)</i>

Up.
<i>(chime)</i>

Up. Stop.

<i>(alarm ringing)</i>

<i>(chattering on TV continues)</i>

Computer:
<i>The time is 4:45 am.</i>

Computer:
<i>The time is 4:45 am.</i>

<i>(alarm continues)</i>

Vision off.

Computer:
<i>The time is 4:45 am.</i>

Alarm off.
Computer:<i> The time is...</i>

<i>(alarm stops)</i>

All lights,
level two of ten.

Woman:
You run, too.

I know who you are.

And now I know
where to find you!

I know where you live!

(car alarm blares)

Hall lights on full.


Woman:
Victor.


Victor.

My name is Emilina Fox.

And I'm
a "World News" journalist.

Here's the thing;
I just want to talk.


Just give me
a second, okay?

Emilina:
Victor?

Look, I'm by myself.

I'm giving you
a choice here.

Talk now, or I can make this
very public, very quickly.



Emilina.

Fox. Yeah, I got it.

Um, could we go sit?

What do you want?

I just want to talk.

Fox:
This is incredible.

You've been here,
this whole time, alone?

Am I the first person that--

The first woman?

All right, look.

I'm gonna need you
to sit down,

and tell me
what you want.

On the chair.

Talk.

I want to know
where you've been hiding.

What you've been doing,
how you survived.

When you're alone, it doesn't
really matter, does it?

Alone is alone.

Well, self-seclusion
and being alone

aren't exactly
the same thing.

I did not do this to myself!

Where were you
and your dedication
to the story

when there was
two million of us?

A million?

500,000?

When there was 10,000 of us.
You weren't looking for me.

Now that I'm the only one...

why do I suddenly matter?

You're a celebrity, Victor.

Why don't you take
full advantage of that?

If you can't make
the most of this situation,

then how can anybody else?

Why should I care...

about anybody else?

I am one...

of a kind!

What do people do
to people like me, huh?

Stick me in a zoo?
Lock me in a lab?

What are you doing here?

You're locked up here.

I mean, you're no more free
here in this apartment

than if you were
locked behind bars.

It's a choice!

Do you even know
what a choice is?

Oh, fuck!

There has to be a way.

You think I'm stupid?

You don't think
I want to be out there

all the time?

I am literally...

a statistic.

And I don't need
to be confronted

by more people like you,

trying to push their way
into my life.

Please, please.
Hey, hey, hey!

Oh, my--
You don't get it, do you?

Could you stop, please?
No.

Let me go.

You said you came here
for a reason?

Want to see
what it's like
to be me?


You're not alone.


I'm sorry.

It's not something that I--

It's okay, you don't
have to explain.

I--

That was me,
I pushed too hard.


I need to show you something.

That's my son.

He turns ten today.

And I promised him...

I get it.

How could we understand
what it's like to be you?

But you have to understand
that we're not all
the same either.

I'm just a woman
that fell in love

with someone like you
years ago.

A lot like me?

'Cause you, uh...

had a kid with some
black guy?

I just thought that we could
help each other this time.

I don't want
my son to feel alone anymore.

Okay.

I'm gonna go.

Wait.


What's his name?

Xavier.

<i>Centuries.</i>
