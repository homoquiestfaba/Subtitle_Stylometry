<i>You got him! You got him!</i>

<i>Only ever met one man I wouldn't want to fight.</i>

I can't stop that.

Here. Get out of here, you useless tit.

<i>When I met him, he was already
the best cut man in the business.</i>

Can you stop it?

<i>Started training and managing in the '60s,
but he never lost his gift.</i>

No.

Let me have a look at him.

He's fine. He's fine.

Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

I'll give you one more round.

Seconds out. Let's go.

What do we do? Tell me what to do.

You let him hit you.

<i>Sometimes, there's just nothing you can do.</i>

<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone...</i>

<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

<i>or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.</i>

<i>There are all kinds
of combinations you come up against</i>

<i>down in the different layers of meat,</i>

<i>and Frankie knew how to work every one.</i>

<i>People love violence.</i>

<i>They slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

<i>Boxing is about respect-</i>

<i>getting it for yourself...</i>

<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

I'll warm up the car.

Mr Dunn?

Hmm. I owe you money?

No, sir.

I know your mama?

Don't rightly know, sir.

Then what is it you want?

I was on the undercard. I won my fight, to0.

Maggie Fitzgerald.

Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

Did you happen to see it?

Nope.
I did pretty good.

Thought you might
be interested in training me.

I don't train girls.

Maybe you should.
People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

Girlie, tough ain't enough.

It's a mistake.

Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

Just push, will you?

What did Hogan want?

Offered us a title shot.

'Bout time.
I turned him down flat.

Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.

You lose it, it may not come around again.

Now, two or three more fights,
and we'll be ready.

Whatever you say, Frankie.

<i>Frankie liked to say
that boxing is an unnatural act,</i>

<i>that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

<i>Sometimes...</i>

<i>best way to deliver a punch is step back.</i>

Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy.

Annie, to0.

Other than that... you know what I want.

There's no use me repeating myself.

<i>But step back too far, you ain't fightin' at all.</i>

Thank you for your prayers.

Bye.
Goodbye.

Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.

Made me weep.

What's confusing you this week?

Oh, it's the same old one God, three God thing.

Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

You only come to Mass every day to wind me
up. It's not going to happen this morning.

Well, I'm confused.

No, you aren't.
Yes, I am.

Then here's your answer: There's one God.

Anything else? Cos I'm busy.

What about the Holy Ghost?
An expression of God's love.

And Jesus?
Son of God. Don't play stupid.

Well, what is he, then?
Does that make him a demigod?

<i>There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan!</i>

Did you write to your daughter?

<i>Absolutely.</i>

Now you're lying to a priest.
You know what? Take a day off.

Don't come to Mass tomorrow.

<i>Some people'd say the most
important thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

<i>Frankie'd say,
"Show me a fighter with nothing but a heart</i>

<i>and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating. "</i>

<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

My name's Dangerous Dillard

<i>Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch
Out of Broward County, Texas!</i>

<i>Danger showed up a couple of years back.</i>

<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

<i>Apparently, Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
'fore he introduced himself.</i>

Hey. You know, I gots nothin' against niggers...

Well, that's nice to hear.

Yeah. Yeah.

Lots of people where I comes from does,

but my mama taught me not to cause hurt
to no man, niggers or not.

You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

<i>Just one of those questions,
but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.</i>

Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the Welterweight Champion of the world.

And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,

<i>to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!</i>

<i>Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.</i>

You got to have at least one fight to be ranked.

<i>Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!</i>

<i>Hey, you a bad man, huh?</i>

Hey, come on, get in the ring.
Go a round with me.

Shawrelle...

I will.

Leave him alone.

Danger, you goon back to training.

Will do, Mr Scrap.

<i>Ow!</i>

Them some nice tights, Danger.

I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.

<i>Those pants look real pretty on you, bro.</i>

Give his mama back her tights.

<i>Shawrelle Berry
had a left hook that would move a tank...</i>

<i>but he had a heart the size of a split pea.</i>

<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

<i>Frankie found out... most gyms lose money.</i>

I thought I told you I didn't want Danger
working out here anymore.

Oh, he ain't hurtin' nothin', Frankie.

Well, he's hurtin' me.

Breakin' my heart watchin' him
punch the air like it's going to punch back.

And how many times have I got to
tell you that bleach is bleach?

Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff?

You don't always have to buy expensive stuff.

It smells better, Frankie.

Bleach smells like bleach.

Hey, Scrap.

Hey, Mr Willie.

Hey, nice fight last night.

Big Willie.

Hey, Sally.

Nice fight.
Thanks, man.

People are talkin'.

"Ta cul fionn is dha shuil ghlasa agat".

What the hell kind of language is that?

What do you want?

I just thought you might like to know

you got a fighter out there
not talking to another manager.

Not talking to another manager?

Not just any manager.

Mickey Mack.

You came in here to tell me
that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

Not a word. Neither one of 'em.

I'm trying to read here.

Well, if you think that's more important...

Who's your new girl?

What?

Jesus Christ.

Better hurry up.

If she keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

<i>You're wasting your time.</i>

<i>- I told you I don't train girls.
Thought you might change your mind.</i>

There's dozens of trainers who train girls.

You won't have any trouble finding one.

Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

<i>- Willie, you ready to work?
Anytime.</i>

If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?

No.

I might as well just keep calling you it.

<i>She came from
southwestern Missouri...</i>

<i>the hills outside
the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia,</i>

<i>set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere
between nowhere and good-bye.</i>

<i>She grew up knowing one thing:</i>

<i>She was trash.</i>

It's for my dog.

<i>She'd come 1,800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

Workin' the bag, boss.

Not your boss... and that bag's working you.

Give her her money back.

You sure?

How much did she pay?

<i>Six months.</i>

Oh, Jesus Christ.

<i>No, I'll just give it back.</i>

No. Don't be a smart-ass now, will you?

Woman thinks I'd throw away six months' dues
just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

But just don't encourage her, understand?
OK.

And... And what's Danger doing out there?

<i>What's he lookin' at?</i>

Looks like a bottle of water.

He paid his dues?

Dues?

Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?

Get out of my office.

Fuck me.

Can't think of it as a bag.

I'm not a trainer,

but I can show you this, if you'd like.

Appreciate any help I can get.

OK. Let's see.

What you want to do is
you want to think of it as a man, see?

And he's constantly moving.

He's moving towards you. He's moving around
you. He's moving away from you, all right?

You don't want to hit him
when he's coming towards you

cos what he's going to do is push you back.

He's going to smother your punches,
take your balance, right?

So watch him carefully.
Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving,

and keep one shoulder back
so you're always ready to fire a power shot.

Right? Go ahead, now.

Good, good. Keep rotating.

Keep moving. That's it.

Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

Come on around.

Keep moving, keep moving.

Good, good, good, good.

Like that?
Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots.

Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.

<i>That's good. That's good.</i>

Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

You do have a speed bag?

I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

All right, you goon home now.

I'll walk out with you?

No, I am home. Want to see?

Yeah.

It's nice.

Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

No, just...

pull the door closed when you leave.

Thank you.

<i>If there's magic in boxing,</i>

<i>it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance,</i>

<i>beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

<i>It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.</i>

<i>OK, come on. Watch the footwork.</i>

Hey, Flip.

Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

I think I found somebody you can beat.

I don't fights women.

Why not, bro?
It's perfect, bro, cos you know why?

Cos she - nah, you-you could fight to him

and then you could kiss to him, and then
you could fight to him one more time.

That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

It's like poetry.
You been reading and shit.

Thanks, bro. That's a girl, man?

I'll be damn, Flip. I think you right.

Look at her little bitty titties.
They're like mosquito bites.

Geez, man, there's barely even a mouthful.

Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

<i>Canvas has titties.</i>

Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

<i>Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.</i>

Come on, bro, the floor is having titties?
That's funny, bro.

Shut up, man.

What you laughing at?

Man, hold the bag, stupid.

Yo, when they start making those tights for men,
Flippy?

Punk.

All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

I'll give you a rubdown.
Oh, I can't, Frankie.

My middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Gracie I'd drive her.

Oh. Something wrong with Gracie's car?

She hates that car. Wants the old one back,
but the dealer won't do it.

Said he's already got a buyer.
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

I'd appreciate that.

<i>OK.</i>

Thanks.

See you later.

The man's a rubdown whore.

Today he doesn't want one?

You ever do any work around here?

Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

Little girl seems to be coming along.

Yeah.

It's almost like someone's been helping her.

She might just be a natural.

Looks like she's got something.

She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.

I wonder how the hell she got that.

I wonder.

I'm going to need that speed bag back.

This bag?
Yes, that bag.

That's my bag, and if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

Is that such a bad thing, boss?

Yes, yes, it is.

Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.

Yeah. Well,
I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.

I understand.

Yeah.

Look, you seem like a nice girl.

Can I give you some advice?
I'd appreciate that.

You're going to find a trainer,
either here or somewhere else,

that's going to want to train a girl.

It's the latest freak show out there.

But the trouble is, they're going to be wasting
your time because you're to00ld.

I don't feel that old.

Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

Takes about four years to train a fighter.

How old are you?

<i>- 31... until my next birthday.
Oh, well, there you go.</i>

31.

You wouldn't start training
to be a ballerina at 31, now, would you?

Already been working it for three years.

And you can't hit a speed bag?

What kind of training is that?

I've never had any, boss.

Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

Yeah.

Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr Dunn.

You're not going to cry now, are you?

No, sir.

Yeah.

Here.

Keep the goddamn thing.

No, you need it.
No, take the bag.

I haven't seen it in 20 years, anyway.

I've had three since then.

Just uh... just enjoy it, will you?

I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.

Yeah.

Just don't lose it.

Yeah, I know, Hogan.

Your guy's the champ, so we don't split fifties.

<i>But if I don't see 40%...</i>

Look, you call me back when it's 60-40,
or don't call me back at all.

Hey, Willie.

Hey, Frankie.
Is something wrong?

I'm sorry to come by your house like this.

I-I know you don't like people dropping in.

Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

I want to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.

Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favour.

Gracie broke out and cried
when she saw it.

Really?

I also needed to talk with you about business.

Oh, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan.
We're all set for September.

Everything but the split.

I gotta leave you, Frankie.

What?

Willie, the... the title is just two fights away.

It ain't that. It's...

It's like you said, I got one shot.

If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

I need somebody in the action,
who can make things happen.

And I gotta make the change before the fight.

Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

So, I get you to the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

Only way he'd do it.

I'm sorry, Frankie.

I know how long
you've been waiting on a title.

I wish it could've been with me.

Mickey Mack's a businessman.

He can't teach you nothing.

You already taught me
everything I need to know.

<i>There's some things
people just don't want to hear.</i>

And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,

to fight me for the
Welterweight Championship of the whole world.

Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

Just working on my footwork, Mr Scrap.

Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

Danger, while you thinking about that punch,
I'll be right back.

I'm... I'm thinking how
I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr Scrap.

<i>No one had the heart
to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

I heard about Willie.

That's cold. That's dead cold.

Course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

Yeah. At least I can see through both eyes.

Yeah, mm-hm. Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

Well, I've got the gym.

Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

Willie tell you why?

It was Mickey.

Mickey's got the connections.

It ain't about connections, Frank.
It's about you not believing in him.

Well, I found him.
I stuck with him for eight years.

How's that for not believing in him?

You could've got him a title fight two years ago.
Hell, he knew that.

<i>I'm amazed he stayed this long.</i>

Yeah, well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head, not protect him?

Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship?

Yeah.

Oh, well, now it makes sense.

Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

You were a hell of a fighter,
a lot better than Willie.

He get you a title fight
or did he just bust you out,

banging your head against other people's fists
until you lost your eye?

I had my shot.

I went out swinging and no man can say I didn't.

Yeah, well, I remember.
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter

spending the second half of his life
cleaning up other people's spit.

<i>Yeah, right.</i>

Right. You're the smart one.

You're the one learning Greek.

It's Gaelic.

Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

How do you say that in Gaelic?

<i>Sorry.</i>

Thanks.

<i>Boxing is an unnatural act...</i>

<i>cos everything in it is backwards.</i>

<i>You want to move to the left,</i>

<i>you don't step left, you push on the right toe.</i>

<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do,</i>

<i>you step into it.</i>

<i>Oh, my God! He hits the
champ with a right hand and the champ's down!</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the ref has ended the count.</i>

<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world!</i>

<i>It's unbelievable how this
has taken place tonight.</i>

<i>But there you have it, folks, a new champion.</i>

<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

Want a cheeseburger?

You bought me a cheeseburger?
Yeah.

I never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.

You watch the fight?

Yeah, I watched it.

Willie did good.

That's what you've got to say?

Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up.

That's good work.

You watch it?

Yeah, I got HBO.

How can you afford HBO?

How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson

<i>at the Stadium Club in Tupelo, Mississippi.</i>

That true?

Yeah. Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

Don't you remember nothing?

Well, I remember walking halfway,

and thinking I was going to be lynched.

I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

Yeah, well, I got a ride.

The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.
I had to walk back two miles.

Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

Hmm.

What the hell's that?

It's her birthday.

You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

So, it's your birthday, huh?

How old does that make you?

I'm 32, Mr Dunn...
and I'm here celebrating the fact

that I spent another year scraping dishes
and waitressing, what I've been doing since 13.

And according to you, I'll be 37
'fore I can even throw a decent punch...

which after working this speed bag for a month
and getting nowhere,

I now realise may be God's simple truth.

Other truth is, my brother's in prison,

my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her babies is still alive,

my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home,

find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

If I'm to00ld for this, then I got nothing.

That enough truth to suit you?

This your speed bag?

Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

OK.

Just hold it, hold it.

I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

No. Sorry.

You're in a position to negotiate?
Yes, sir,

because I know if you train me right,
I'm going to be a champ.

I seen you looking at me.

Yeah, out of pity.

<i>Don't you say that!</i>

<i>Don't you say that if it ain't true!</i>

I want a trainer.

<i>I don't want charity,</i>

and I don't want favours.

If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

Stop, stop, stop.

Goddamn it, stop.

What the hell are you doing?

OK.

If I'm going to take you on...

You won't never regret it.

Look, just listen to me.

If I take you on...
I promise I'll work so hard.

God, this is a mistake already.

Mm-mm. I'm listening, boss.

If I take you on, you don't say anything.

You don't question me.

You don't ask why, you don't say anything
except maybe, "Yes, Frankie".

<i>And I'm going to try to forget
the fact that you're a girl.</i>

It's all I ask.

And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

<i>- All righty.
We got a deal.</i>

No, not quite.

I'm going to teach you how to fight.

Then, we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

I hate to argue with you, but...

Don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it.

I teach you all you need to know, and then
you go off and make a million dollars.

<i>I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.</i>

I don't want to hear about it either way,
that's how it is. It's the only way I'll do it.

All right.

Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is, you never move your feet.

You stand there just flatfooted.
You've got to move your feet.

That's one of the best things
I'm going to be able to teach you.

So, here's what you do. You get yourself...

Bend your knees a little bit.

Get in an athletic position.

Look like you're going to hit something.

<i>- Move 'em how, boss?
Uh, just, you go hit the bag.</i>

<i>- Stop.
What'd I do wrong?</i>

OK, you did two things wrong.

One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

Now, what I want you to do...

It's not about hitting it hard.

It's how good you hit it.

So, watch me.

And you can count with me if you want,
just count;

On a one count, I hit right through the bag.

Can you show me that again?
You just...

Just say "one", please.

<i>- One.
OK, one.</i>

One.
OK.

Yeah, just say one.
That's good. That's good.

Then I move over to my right foot.

You'll see my weight is
shifting to my right foot.

Then I hit it with the back of my hand,
sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

Then I come over,

and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

And ice pick manoeuvre again, and I come
over on my right foot and hit it right, left.

Don't watch anything but my feet.

One, two, three...

Just do it like that. Just keep practising.

<i>Need to show 'em how to
stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

<i>To make a fighter,
you got to strip 'em down to bare wood.</i>

Rest when you're dead.

Come here.

<i>You can't just tell 'em
to "forget everything you know".</i>

<i>You got to make 'em forget it in their bones.</i>

Left uppercut, left, left.

<i>Make 'em so tired they only listen to you,</i>

<i>only hear your voice,
only do what you say and nothing else.</i>

Move your feet.

Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

<i>Show 'em how to keep their balance</i>

<i>and take it away from the other guy.</i>

Not so low. Look at me.

Right hook and just turn right over...

<i>How to generate
momentum off your right toe...</i>

<i>...and how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

<i>How to fight backing up,</i>

<i>so that the other guy
doesn't want to come after you.</i>

<i>Then you got to show 'em all over again -</i>

<i>over and over and over till they think
they were born that way.</i>

Shift. Shift away. Shift away.

OK, that's enough for today.

Good work. Good girl.

Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?

Hey.

<i>Hey, come here.</i>

You're not breathing.

Hate to disagree with you.

Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

Now, stop doing that.

OK.

But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?

I mean, for a girl.

I don't train girls.

Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?

Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

I'd like to, but you've
been keeping me to0 busy.

Got any family, boss?

What?

You been spending all this time with me.
I didn't know if you had any.

<i>No.</i>

Well, I've got a daughter - Katy.

That's family.

We're not exactly close.

How much she weigh?

What?

Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

Yeah.

Not very big.

Used to be real athletic.

Don't know if she kept it up.

<i>So... what do you think?</i>

Am I ready for a fight?

Hey, Sally.

Come here for a minute, will you?

Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, OK?

<i>Can I see you a minute?</i>

Sally here is a real good manager.
Has a couple Golden Glove boys.

Looking for a girl, Sally?

I'm looking for a good one.

Well, see, there you go.

Nice working with you, girlie.

What'd you want?
Nothing. It's nothing.

<i>I ain't lying. I been watching you work.
You've got a hell of a left.</i>

Thank you.

So, you want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?

Yeah, sure.

Good... cos I think you're ready for a fight.

All right.

<i>Break!</i>

What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

You're doing great. You're wearing her down.
Just keep punching.

I ain't doing great. I'm losing.

You're wearing her down.

Nice night, ain't it?

Jesus Christ.

That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

Hell of a fighter. 11 and 0.

Your left. Keep your left up.

Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ.

Yeah.

<i>Your left, damn it!</i>

Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight,

but Sally's a good manager.

He must think she can take her.

<i>Jesus H, your left!</i>

<i>Keep your left up!</i>

You think she can hear you from back here?

Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

Might even help him.

Lonnie's girl gets another win,

Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

Hey, what do I know?

I just come cos I enjoy the fights.

<i>Mother of God!</i>

<i>OK, break!</i>

<i>Hey! Come here, come here.</i>

<i>Hey, get over here!</i>

You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?

You're doing a hell of a job of it.
Is this how you advise your lightweight?

Dunn, what the hell are you doing?

I'm talking. What you doing?
This your fighter?

<i>It's my fighter!</i>

It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

Fine. You take her.
She can't fight worth a shit, anyway.

Somebody tell me what's going on.

I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

You're telling me this is your fighter?

Yeah, this is my fighter.

Then you got ten seconds.

I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it drops.

Well, let it drop.
That'd be a lot easier.

She thinks she knows you, that's all.

Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top,

so you just wait for her, see?

That's all she's thinking about.

And when she cocks
that big right hand, you hear me?

And when she does, you step to the side
and come over with this big "good night" hook.

Got one?
Got it right here.

OK.

Fight, or I'm calling it.
Go give it to her.

<i>The body knows
what fighters don't - how to protect itself.</i>

<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

<i>Twist it just a hair more, and the body says,</i>

<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here, cos you obviously
don't know what you're doing".</i>

Neutral corner.

<i>Two, three, four...</i>

See the way she did that?
Yeah.

Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.

<i>"Lie down, now. Rest, and we'll
talk about this when you regain your senses".</i>

<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

Don't get all carried away, now. Good girl.

Thanks, boss.

You, uh... You forgot the rule.

Now, what is the rule?
Keep my left up?

It's to protect yourself at all times.

Now, what is the rule?

Protect myself at all times.

Good, good.

You gave me away. How's that protecting me?

It wasn't.

It's OK.

I'll work on my left, boss.

Drink your water.

Other than that, how'd I do?

Fine. You did fine.

You gonna leave me again?

Never.

That place you work - do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

Sure.

Not the kind with the canned filling crap?

Oh, big can, yea size.
It says "homemade" on the label.

I want you to take the weekend off.
It's only Thursday.

You gonna argue with me?

Know better than to do that, boss.

Good.

<i>All fighters
are pig-headed some way or other.</i>

<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

Can you uh... spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong,</i>

<i>even if that one thing
is going to be the ruin of them,</i>

<i>if you can beat that last bit out of 'em,</i>

<i>then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

Thought I said I'd see you Monday.

You sure did, boss.

That was last night.

You said not to argue with you.

Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

You want my advice?

What?

Where are your shoes?

I'm airing out my feet.

You got big holes in your socks.

Oh, they're not that big.

Didn't I give you money for some new ones?

These are my sleeping socks.

<i>My feet like a little air at night.</i>

How come you're wearing 'em
in the daytime, then?

Cos my daytime socks
got to0 many holes in 'em.

Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

Please.

Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.

Might find its way to the track.

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.</i>

I got the breathing thing down.

No, you ain't breathing because you're knocking
'em out in the first round.

Thought that was the point.

The point is to get good.

Can't get good if you keep knocking 'em out
in the first round.

How am I going to get you fights?

Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed.

<i>Why am I still doing four-rounders, boss?</i>

Cos you haven't got the lungs for six rounds,
that's why.

I do if I keep knocking 'em
out in the first round.

<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

<i>just to let her know who was boss.</i>

Three, four, five,

<i>six, seven...</i>

Sorry, boss.

<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

<i>Down!</i>

To the corner. Three, four...

<i>five...</i>

<i>six, seven,</i>

<i>eight...</i>

<i>nine, ten! It's over!</i>

<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her
decent fights,</i>

<i>sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

<i>But that only worked for so long.</i>

<i>Then Frankie did something he hated doing.</i>

<i>He took a chance.</i>

<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

Break. Break. Step back.

<i>Time.</i>

Dang.
Dang.

Hey, give us two seconds, will ya?
Just two seconds.

<i>- Your nose is broke.
Dang!</i>

Fix it.
I can't. I can't.

You can fix it.

I can't. I've gotta call it.
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

The ring doctor's gonna call it.

Please. If you can stop the blood, I can beat her.

Bite down on this.

OK.

Inhale.

What?
Inhale.

What?

Breathe in.

OK, huh?

Yeah, it's OK.

Yeah. All right.

You got 20 seconds before
this turns into a geyser

and it's gonna spray all over the front row.

20 seconds - that's all you've got.

Get goin'.

<i>Go to your corner!</i>

<i>Two,</i>

<i>three, four, five,</i>

six, seven,

<i>eight,</i>

<i>nine, ten!</i>

"Mo cuishle".

Whatcha reading?

What's she saying?

Wants to know what you're reading.

It's Yeats.

Keep your head back.

Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her?

Show her what a treat that is.

When the hell they gonna get to her?

I'm OK, Frankie.

What'd you learn tonight?

Always protect myself.

What's the rule?
Always protect myself.

<i>- Margaret Fitzgerald?
Here.</i>

I'll be right here.

How you doin'?

Me?
Yeah, you.

I'm not the one who's hurt.

Broken nose don't hurt that much.

Why are you telling me that?

No reason.

<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

Did you write your daughter?

Every week.

I've no idea why you come to church.

<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

<i>The first was to fight Billie "The Blue Bear"
Osterman for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

<i>Billie the Blue Bear!</i>

<i>Billie was a former
prostitute out of East Berlin.</i>

<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

<i>Didn't matter to her
something like that could kill a person.</i>

And the crowds loved her.

<i>He turned it down without even telling her.</i>

<i>The next was to fight the British champ,
a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.</i>

Hello?

Not interested.

<i>He turned that down, too.</i>

That's a lot of money, boss.

Yeah. You're making money.
What're you still working here for?

It's a title match, right?

Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.

She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

Might still be a good fight.

Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight.

To0 good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.

Well, you can get yourself another manager
any time you want.

In fact, if you'd learnt
to protect your face a little better,

I wouldn't have to turn down this money.

My face out there so much,
it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss.
