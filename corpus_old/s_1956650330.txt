(train horn blowing
in distance)

(quiet chatter)

COOK:
Here you go, love.

â™ª HERBIE HANCOCK:
Come Running To Me

â™ª Tears at night cos you're scared

Thanks.

â™ª Little girl all afraid

â™ª Stuck between
night and day...

Didn't you ask
for scrambled eggs?

Yeah.

It's all good.
No, it's not.

It's just eggs.

I have a thing about that.
Eggs?

No, about people
not doing their job well.

Man, she got four kids and
an alcoholic husband at home.

She doing the best she can.
How do you know that?

She comes through my line
every Sunday,

yelling at her kids,
giving me a stack of coupons.

She can never find
her Costco card,

so I always let her use mine
so she can get a discount.

That's nice of you.

Can I ask you something?

I don't know. Can you?

Easy. I know good grammar.
Do you?

We're not in a classroom.

Are you gonna ask me
your question or not?

What took you so long
to respond to me?

I didn't realise
that much time had passed.

I sent you a very well-crafted
message three weeks ago.

I spell-checked it
and everything. Got crickets.

Then, today, out of the blue,
you hit me up,

asking if you want
to grab dinner.

What changed?

I had a shitty day.

What was so shitty about it?

The state decided
to execute my client.

I didn't know that was still legal here.
Yep.

It's legal in 31 states,

and Ohio happens
to be one of them.

Was he innocent?

Even if he's not,
the state shouldn't decide

whether he lives or dies.

Sorry.

Me, too.

Normally, I would go home and
have a glass of wine by myself,

but I didn't feel like
being alone.

Not tonight.

You didn't have any friends
or family you can call?

No.

So you turned to Tinder.


What made you pick me?

(chuckles softly)

I liked your picture.

Word?

You had this sad look
on your face.

I felt sorry for you.

Damn.

I didn't mean for that
to sound shady.

Well, it did.

My dad took that picture of me.

And, to be honest, I don't have
many photos of myself.

Why not?
I know what I look like.

Pictures aren't just
about vanity.

They're proof
of your existence.

My family know I exist.

That's enough.

(chuckles softly)

You gonna eat that?

You can have some.

Mm.

Man, they always use just the
right amount of dressing here.

Do you really like this place,

or is it the only spot
you could afford?

It's black-owned.

TouchÃ©.

QUEEN: You know, you really
shouldn't text and drive.

SLIM: Ain't nobody texting.
I'm making sure I don't get lost.

I could tell you
how to get to my house.

Give me my phone.
Relax. I'm gonna give it back.

So, you gonna tell me where to turn?
Yeah, just...

SLIM: Oh, so now you're gonna
point the directions?

I'm telling you where to go.

You made a playlist?
That's cute.

Don't go through my phone.

Did you like In A Sentimental Mood
before or after Love Jones?

I knew about that shit
way before Love Jones.

Mm-hm. Don't lie.

I mean, OK, I fucked with it more
after I saw the movie.

I appreciate your honesty.

â™ª Soul only knows

â™ª This type of vibe...

So, what happens tonight?

You're gonna drop me off,

and then you'll go home, I guess.

Oh.

we were gonna have sex?

(Queen laughing)

Nah. What do you...

No.

Wow.

I thought we were
gonna hang out.

Maybe get to know each other.
Mm.

Nah, I'm good.

â™ª You're all that I feel

(tyres squeal)

â™ª Soul...

(Slim sighs)

(siren whooping)

OFFICER (over speaker):
Pull over.

SLIM: Damn.
(siren wailing)

Do you have any warrants?
(siren stops)

Really?
Do you?

Nah, I ain't got no warrants.

Do you have any weapons
in the car? Any narcotics?

Um, I got a...
I got a pocketknife

in the glove compartment.

That's fine.
I know it is.

â™ª Like spaces that fall
in my soul

â™ª See, baby, that has no rhyme

â™ª Do you like how it feels

â™ª When I smoke you out?

â™ª Head down to your toes

â™ª Making you, making you...

OFFICER:
Turn the radio down.

(music stops)

Put your hand down.
QUEEN: He only had it up

because you're shining
a light in his eyes.

I'm just trying to see
inside the vehicle.

It's just us.

Licence, registration.

I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm grabbing my wallet.

(chuckles)
I can see that.

Well, y'all like to shoot first
and ask questions later, so...

Got something
you want to say to me?

No, I don't.

You know why
I stopped you tonight?

No, sir.

Failed to execute
a turn signal back there.

You're swerving
a little bit, too.

Oh, my bad.

Yeah, it is.

QUEEN:
I can't believe this shit.

SLIM:
Just chill.

I ain't trying to die tonight.

OFFICER (over radio):
Copy that.

1104, dispatch.

DISPATCH OFFICER:
What do you got?

Two occupants... driver's a black male,
passenger black female...

in a white Honda Accord.

Licence: "Trust God."

Operator failed
to execute a turn signal,

is driving erratically.

Possible DUI. Over.

Do you need backup?

Negative.

(indistinct police radio
communication)

(knocks on window)

I'm gonna ask you to step out
of the vehicle for me.

Can I ask why, Officer?

No, you may not.

Step out of the car.

Let's go, man.

(unfastens seat belt)

Back bumper.
Hands on the hood.

I'm gonna ask you one time -
got anything on you

I need to know about?
No, sir.

Illegal substances?

No, sir.

What about in the vehicle?

No, sir.

(indistinct police radio
communication)

You been drinking tonight?
(chuckles) No.

Why is that funny?

Cos I don't drink.

Could you do me a favour,
pop the trunk?

Why?
Cos I asked you to.

Ain't nothing in there
but shoeboxes.

Let's see 'em.

Right there.


(honks horn)

(window whirring down)
OFFICER: May I help you?

Do you have a warrant?

agreed to the search.

I don't need a warrant.

What's in the boxes?
Shoes.

You mind if I take a look?

That's fine.
(rummaging)

(indistinct police radio
communication)


(indistinct police radio
communication)

Could you please hurry up?

What did you say?

It's just cold.

Put your hands on your head,
and get on the ground now.

Are you serious?
Get on the fucking ground!

Get on the fucking ground!
Why is he under arrest?

Back in the car,
or you're going to jail, too!

QUEEN: I am an attorney,
and I demand to know why

this man is under arrest.
Sir.

Sir, sir, sir, we don't
have to do this.

Why is he under arrest?

What is your name?
Get back in the car!

What is your badge number?
Get back in the fucking car!

Get back in the car. We got this.

Why is he under arrest?
What is your badge number?

Sir, sir, it was a turn signal.
I ain't done nothing wrong. Sir...

I'm reaching for my cellphone.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em!

I have the right to record this arrest.
Hands where I can see 'em!

I'm reaching for my cellphone!

(grunting and yelling)

Put your fucking hands...
Stop resisting!

Stop! Stay down on the fucking ground!

Stop...
Please stop!

Stop fucking resisting!
Now stay down!

(grunting, yelling)

Stop fucking resisting!

Stop!


(officer gurgles, exhales)


(shuddering breaths)

(shuddering breaths)

Are you OK?

Yeah.


You good?

Huh? You OK?

(trembling breaths)

Let's go.

We can't just leave him here.

Yes, we can.

Now, let's go.

Come on!

SLIM:
I got to call my dad.

(window whirring down)
What the fuck are you doing?


QUEEN: We can't call anybody.
It'll make them accomplices.

SLIM: You could've just said that.
Now we ain't got no phones.

QUEEN: Phone ain't nothing
but a tracking device.

SLIM: You're bleeding a lot.

QUEEN:
It's OK. It only grazed me.

SLIM: Fuck!
Why didn't you stay in the car?

QUEEN:
So, this is my fault?

If I didn't get out the car,
you would be dead right now.

SLIM: We got to get you to a hospital.
QUEEN: No!

We can't. Just keep driving.

(trembling breaths)
SLIM: Here.

Use this to stop the bleeding.
QUEEN: Fuck.

SLIM: What if he was wearing
a body cam, huh?

There was a camera in the car.

This shit about to be
all over the fucking news.

QUEEN: That's why
we have to keep going.

We can't run forever.
I know that!

But we got to keep running
until we come up with a better plan.

SLIM: Start throwing out some ideas.

QUEEN: Since when am I in charge
of coming up with the ideas?

Since you made the decision to run!
We made that decision together.

SLIM:
I don't remember that.

Man, fuck this.

(tyres squeal)

(tyres squeal)

Where are you going?
I'm a find somebody

with a phone so I can call my family.

If you do, they'll know where we are.
Great.

What if they kill us?
Don't say that!

There's no guarantee they won't.


You're a black man that killed
a cop and then took his gun.

I'm not a criminal.

You are now.

I just want to go home,
and I want to see my family.

If you turn yourself in,
you will never see them again.

All we can do is go forward.

There is nothing
back there for us.

Please.

Let's just keep going.

What about your family, huh?

You don't care about
leaving them behind?

No, I don't.

We can't just keep driving.

We need to figure out what
the fuck we gonna do.

All right.

All right, all right.

Let's go to my uncle's house.

We can... We can stay there
for a few days,

then we can figure out
our next move.

Where does your uncle live?

New Orleans.
That's hours from here.

Then we should get going.

(shuddering breaths)

(dog barking in distance)
(Queen exhales sharply)

(engine starts)

â™ª MARVIN SAPP:
The Best In Me

â™ª See, he's mine

â™ª And I am his

â™ª It doesn't matter what I did

â™ª He only sees me for who I am

â™ª Does anybody know that tonight?

â™ª Oh

â™ª See, he is mine

â™ª And I am his

â™ª Said it doesn't matter

â™ª What I did...
(sighs)

Could you please
turn that shit down?

â™ª For who I am...

It's the only thing
that calms me.

Well, I can't
hear myself think.

I don't care.

â™ª I'm his

â™ª Said it doesn't matter what I did

â™ª It doesn't matter...
(music stops)

Don't touch my shit.
Pull over.

Why?
So I can get out.

You ain't going nowhere.

We in this together.

QUEEN:
Why are you slowing down?

SLIM:
I'm out of gas.

QUEEN:
Why didn't you say something?

What you mean, why didn't I say something?
I had other shit on my mind.

Now we got to flag this car down.
I hope they black.

QUEEN:
That ain't always a good thing.

(doors open)

(door closes)

(brakes squeal)
MAN: Y'all having car trouble?

Uh, yeah, we...
we ran out of gas.

Ma'am, are you all right?


Yeah. I just...
I accidentally cut myself.

Tell you what,
why don't y'all hop in my truck?

I got a first aid kit
in the back seat.

There's a gas station up the road.

I'll give you a ride.
We don't mind walking.

Come on, now. I don't bite.

I'll give you a ride.

Sure you're all right there?
QUEEN: I'm good.

Oh, fuck.

What?
What?

Something wrong?

No, I...

I didn't know you were a sheriff.
Oh, yeah.

I'm off duty today.
(Slim chuckles)

You know what?

I think we can walk
the rest of the way.

(both chuckling)

No.

This will be my good deed
for the day.

SLIM:
Uh-huh.

Y'all OK?
Y'all... You seem jumpy.

(Slim chuckles)
No, we're fine.

We just uh... We took a wrong
turn somewhere and got lost.

Uh... Where are we?

Oh, this here is Kentucky,
my friends.

Don't you worry. We'll get you some gas,
and you'll be on your way.

Ma'am, how's your leg?
Uh... much better.

Thank you.

SHERIFF:
Gas costs money.

SLIM:
Oh, shit, oh.

I left my stuff back in the car.

QUEEN:
Me, too.

SHERIFF (chuckles):
All right. I got you.

(grunts)
Thank you.

Thanks so much.
Yep. I'll be right back.

(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

(electronic chiming)

Howdy. Y'all got gas cans?

Uh... yeah. First aisle.
Can't miss it.

I'd like to fill this up.
That's gonna be ten bucks.

All right.

DISPATCH:
187, 10-29 Frank.

Officer shot and killed in Ohio
by two assailants.

Suspects are
one young black male,

one young black female.

YBF was wounded by officer.

Suspects are said to be
armed and dangerous.

Last seen operating
white Honda Accord.

Stop pacing.
I can't help it.

You look guilty.
I am guilty.

Have you been charged?

No.
Then you're not guilty.

Why is he staring at us
like that?

I don't know.

(cash register beeping)

CASHIER:
Do you need anything else?

Is that it?

Um...

Yeah, yeah, that's uh...
that's it.

Get in the driver's seat.
Are you crazy?

I think he knows.

(engine starts)

Oh, fuck.
Y'all gonna leave without me?

SHERIFF: Whoa.
Get in the car.

Take it easy.

The fuck?

(scoffs)
Take it easy.

Get in.

All right. All right.

I'm getting in.

SHERIFF:
My name's Edgar.

I've lived in Kentucky
all my life.

My wife died three years ago,

and I've been raising our son
all by myself.

I'm all he's got in this world.

Watching him grow up has been
the greatest blessing of my life.

Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill you.

Well, is it true?
Did y'all kill that police officer?

It was self-defence.

Oh, I'm sure it was.

I've got some colleagues

who have crossed the line
more than once.

QUEEN:
Pop the trunk.

SLIM: Why?
Just do it.

(trunk opens)

Get in. Please.


EDGAR: Look, I don't know
what happened,

but whatever it was,

I'm sure you had good reason
for doing what you did.

Now, please let me help you.

What'd you do that for?
He wanted to help us.

He isn't gonna help us.

It is their job to make you
feel like everything will be OK,

but the second you confess,
you become property of the state.

Is that what you want?

You want to be
the state's property?

No.

(truck door opens)

SLIM:
Slow down.

QUEEN:
I got it.

SLIM: I'm just trying to keep us
from getting pulled over again.

QUEEN:
I'm hungry.

SLIM:
Me, too.

Let's stop at McDonald's
or something.

QUEEN:
That's disgusting.

SLIM: Now ain't the time
to be choosy.

BOY (laughs):
Do it again.

(both sigh)

Ah, shit.
We ain't got no money.

Check the glove box.


Anything?
No.

Look at God.
(chuckles softly)

(boys laughing, chatting indistinctly)

Oh!
Ooh.

Oh, man.


Hey!
What you doing?

QUEEN:
Chill. I got this.

Hey. You want to make some
money and get some free food?

What's the catch?

Ain't no catch, little man.

All right.
What y'all want?

Let me get
a double cheeseburger

with a ten-piece chicken nuggets
and sweet-and-sour sauce.

And I'll have a chicken sandwich
with no condiments and a small fries.

You can keep the change.

Ain't gonna be that much left
after all that.

(boy grunts)

(chewing loudly)

You make a lot of noise
when you eat.

Woman, this could be my last meal.
Would you just let me be?

It's just hard for me to eat
with you making that much noise.

(chewing quietly)

I never heard of someone
not being able to eat

because they're disgusted
by the sound of other people eating.

I know it's weird,
but I have a thing about it.

How you avoid the sounds
of people eating?

I eat alone most of the time.

That's not surprising.

You scared?

No.
(chuckling): You're lying.

How do you know?

You answered too fast.

BOY (in distance):
Come on, man!

I thought,
if a person answered quickly,

that meant they were
telling the truth.

My dad always told me the person
that answers too quickly

had a lie ready to go.

Well, that's good to know.

How you know if your clients
are telling the truth?

I don't.

Then how can you defend 'em?

That's my job.

Are you a good lawyer?

BOY (in distance):
Come on!

I'm an excellent lawyer.

Why do black people always
feel the need to be excellent?

Why can't we just be ourselves?

BOY (in distance):

We should go.

Hey.

Is this y'all?

(shouting on video)

Nah, man, that ain't us.

(engine starts)
Wait! My daddy want to talk to y'all.

Wait, where you going?
(engine revving)


MAN (groans):
Fuck!

Daddy! Daddy!
God!

Oh, shit!

(man groaning)

Nigga, watch where you're going, dawg!
I'm sorry. I didn't see you coming.

You almost killed my daddy!
God, think you got my bad knee.

Can you move it?
You broke my daddy leg!

MAN: Stop crying like a little
bitch! I'm a be a'ight.

Mama told you to stop
calling me a little bitch.

Nigga, I'll call you
what the fuck I want.

We have to go now.
MAN: Ooh.

Y'all gotta take him to the hospital.
We can't go to a hospital.

So, I can get y'all food, but you can't
take my daddy to the hospital?

Where's the nearest hospital?
We don't have time for that.

Would you calm down?
Don't talk to me like that.

I'll talk to you however I want.

MAN: Y'all sound like
me and my bitch.

BOY:
Don't call my mama a bitch.

Nigga, I wasn't talking
about your mama.

Come on, we're gonna take you
to the hospital.

I got plenty of hos.

Your mama ain't
the only one, too.


Ooh. Move your fat ass.
Come on.


Boy, just gonna sit there?
Oh, God.

No problem.
Shit.

No, you enjoy it, man.
(groaning)

Sick and tired of you.
(whimpering, groaning)

(engine starts)

MAN:
Oh, goddamn.

Fuck.

Damn, my knee!

I support what y'all doing.
What do you mean?

You killing all these
crooked-ass cops.

Need to take out
all these motherfuckers.

That's not what we're doing.
I've seen the tape, OK?

Shit, if a cop shot at my bitch,
I'd have killed his ass, too.

Mm, cop killers, cop killers!

Shut the fuck up, man.

Are y'all the new Black Panthers?

Is that what this is?

No.

Oh, this revenge.
For what?

For that nigga
he killed two years ago.

What?

Some dude was taking
his daughter to school,

minding his own business.

And that cop killed him for no reason.

Did you know about this?

Of course not.
MAN: Hey.

Hey. Hey, the hospital
on the left.

Pull over. Pull over.

All right, we're here.

Y'all gonna help me
with him or not?

Nah. Nah, nah, nah.

There's probably cameras
all up and through this bitch.

(groans softly)

Come on. Come on.

Come on, come on.

Come on, boy.

SLIM:
Sorry, man.

Power to the people.

Come on, Dad.
(groaning)

I got you. I got you.

(grunting, groaning)

â™ª Look alive, life too short

â™ª Mine is double the reports

â™ª Speaking 'bout me and you

â™ª Since they got me off the porch

â™ª I've been beaten black and blue

QUEEN:
So, how many views did it have?

SLIM:
100,000.

QUEEN:
Fuck.

SLIM: How long before a helicopter
starts flying over us?

I don't know.

SLIM:
Please tell me you didn't

fuck with that cop on purpose.
Of course not.

SLIM: I don't know you
like that. You could be crazy.

QUEEN: It should be a sin
to call a black woman crazy.

SLIM: You one of those that think
God is a black woman?

I don't believe in God.

SLIM:
Lord, help me.

QUEEN: You're on "E" again.
Fuck.

I need you
to start paying attention to that shit!

Why don't you pay attention?
You're driving!

â™ª I still remember when
we used to always chat

â™ª Afraid to be in love,
afraid to just be friends

â™ª I still remember when
you used to call me up...

SLIM: I don't think it's smart
to be walking into gas stations.

QUEEN: It's not that scary.
I already told you what to do.

SLIM: Only cos
you don't have to do it.

QUEEN:
You got this.

I believe in you.

SLIM:
Don't patronise me.

QUEEN:
I'm not.

QUEEN:
There's one.

NEWSWOMAN: The city council and
the mayor now are taking action.

They've been hammering out
an ordinance for weeks.

Now they have drafted a final
version of the legislation

that could be voted on as early as
the next council meeting.

NEWSWOMAN 2: Now the
breaking news out of Ohio.

QUEEN:
Just be cool.

Local PD are on
the lookout for two suspects:

an African-American man
and woman,

who they say shot and killed
a police officer

during a roadside altercation.

Dashcam footage of the shooting
was released late...

(shuts off engine)
(radio stops)

QUEEN:
Fuck.

(banging)
Fuck.

(bell clanging)

Let me get 40 on pump nine.

Is that a Glock?

Yeah.

Can I hold it?

No, you can't.

I'll pay for your gas
if you let me hold it.

It's not a fair trade, like...

You don't let me hold it, you're gonna
have to stick up another gas station.

Man, I'll kill you right now.

You don't look like a killer to me.


What's it about holding
a deadly weapon

that just makes me feel so alive?

What the fuck are you doing?

What you doing?

(fly buzzing)

What you doing?

Hmm?

I'm just messing with you, man.

(cash register beeps, clicks)

(bell clangs)

â™ª Hold up

â™ª SOLANGE:
Almeda

â™ª Pour my drink, drink

â™ª Sip, sip

â™ª Sip, sip, sip

â™ª Pull that Lac on 'em

â™ª Sip, sip

â™ª Sip, sip, sip

â™ª Brown liquor, brown liquor

â™ª Brown skin, brown face

â™ª Brown leather, brown sugar

â™ª Brown leaves, brown keys

â™ª Brown zippers, brown face

â™ª Black skin, black braids

â™ª Glass waves, black days

â™ª Black baes, black days

â™ª These are black-owned things

â™ª Black faith

â™ª Still can't be washed away...

(shuts off engine)
(music stops)

(dog barking nearby)

(music blaring in house)

Damn, why you knock
like the police?

If you didn't throw our
phones out, we could've called.

If I didn't throw our phones out,
the police would've caught us by now.

TouchÃ©.

(music continues blaring
in house)

(dogs barking nearby)

Can I help you?
My uncle here?

Who's your uncle?
Bitch, don't play with me.

He in the back.

â™ª I'm a ride-or-die
and I don't need the heat

â™ª And drop that ass
and pop it like a shootout

â™ª I pull them panties down and start it
like they brought the food out

â™ª I hop up on that face and
make my hips go like a luau

â™ª I showed you I'm a gangsta...

(music continues in other room)

Well, if it isn't
the black Bonnie and Clyde.

I don't know
what the news is saying,

but whatever it is,
it's not true.

(long sigh)

Y'all hungry?

Yeah.


(chewing loudly)

EARL: I'd always hoped
you'd escape this life

without getting shot at.

Who patched you up?
She did.

You ain't do a good job.

What's your plan?
We need to figure that out.

Y'all need to hurry up
and figure it out quick.

The police, they like slave catchers.
They can smell a runaway for miles.

I'm aware.

How you gonna outrun
the police?

We don't have to. We just have to make
sure they don't know where we are.

That ain't hard to do.

Cops are dumb as shit.
Not all of 'em.

She only say that cos she used to fuck
one of them motherfuckers.

Don't be jealous.
I ain't jealous of nobody.

Niggas jealous of me.
We might need to stay here for a while.

Oh, hell, nah.

SWAT team probably
already on they way.

I don't need muscle-neck motherfuckers
sniffing round my shit.

So, what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.

You'd just let us get killed?
That's the risk you take.

Fuck you, Earl.

How long you need to stay?

A night or two.

Well, which one is it?

Two nights.

Fine.

We need some cash.
How much?

Enough to last us for a few days.

What else?

We need one of your cars.

You can kiss my black ass.

He love them cars
more than he love us.

I ain't got no extra cars
just laying around.

What about the blue Catalina?
Goddess, shut the fuck up.

And it's turquoise.

I don't know
how low-key we gonna be

riding around in a turquoise Catalina.

That's the whole point.
We'd be hiding in plain sight.

Do you agree
to my terms or not?

(scoffing chuckle)

I ain't giving you no damn car.

You owe me.

OK.

Go get my car keys.

Sit down.

Y'all need to figure out
what the hell

you gonna do
once you leave here.

We will.

Youngblood.
Hmm?

She speak for both of you?

No.

Could have fooled me.
QUEEN: Don't do that.

Well, I'm just trying to
understand this nigga mind.

You ask me, he seems a little...

a little slow.

I think we should go to Cuba.

EARL:
That's what I'm talking about.

Isn't that where um... um...

Assata Shakur went
after she killed that state trooper?

Allegedly killed.

We just gotta keep driving
until we get to Miami, then...

We'll be standing in front of
a large body of water.

How we supposed to cross that?

I don't know yet.
Of course you don't.

You got a better idea?

Where you think you're going?
To lay down.

I'm exhausted.

Y'all ain't going nowhere
till you shave your heads.

We're not doing that.

Wanna keep walking around
looking like that tape?

You're not shaving my head.

Fine. You can choose.

You're a woman.

I believe in
a woman's right to choose.

But you ain't shit.

Use the cheap razor on his ass.

â™ª Cos we young, made and paid

â™ª I lay on white butter,
my ice'll make you stutter

â™ª I'm young, local and gutter
but thoed as a motherfucker

(electric razor buzzing)

â™ª My album Who Is Mike Jones?
coming soon

â™ª My album

â™ª Who Is Mike Jones
coming soon

â™ª I'm a pimp, I walk with a limp

â™ª I step inside Pappadeaux
eating on shrimp, shrimp

â™ª I'm a baller, lane-to-lane crawler

â™ª Clarion faller,
candy roll hogger...

Man, this is fucked-up.

This what happens when
you're on the run from the law.

â™ª I'm a grinder,
that's why I'm a shiner

â™ª I left behind whiners
to be a big-timer...

(song fades)

(winces in pain)

I didn't know Earl had a niece.

We're not close.

Who's he related to?
Your mother or your father?

My mother.
Mm.

She and I weren't close, either.

Damn. Who are you close to?

Are you close to your family?

Yeah.

They don't care how I make
my money, as long as I'm happy.

Are you?
Sometimes.

What makes you happy?

Uh... robes at fancy hotels,

a good lace front,

and when your uncle
kisses me on the forehead.

Mm.

What?

Nothing.

I'm just surprised

by the amount of love
he has in his life.

Well, he don't always
deserve it.

He needs us to worship him.

Out there, he ain't shit.

But in here, he a king.

(chuckles softly)

You like it?

I don't know yet.

You like this shit.

Shut up.

NEWSWOMAN: A nationwide
manhunt is underway

after a police officer
was shot and killed

during a routine traffic stop
last night in Cleveland, Ohio.

Investigators are looking
for two suspects,

one African-American male
and one female,

in connection with the killing
of the officer.

Police say the suspects
fled the scene

in a white Honda Accord

and are considered to be
armed and dangerous.

Dashcam footage of the shooting

has been posted to social media
and news outlets

in an effort to track down
the suspects.

The shooting has gained
national attention

and highlighted a racial divide...

I know you stole
my pinkie ring.

Whatever, nigga.

My daddy gave me that ring.

Don't nobody care
about that fake-ass ring.

..information on the shooting or the
suspects, please contact our hotline...

That's your problem.


You don't care about shit.

Oh, that's my problem?

Yeah.

(takes deep breath)

That your problem.

Nigga, you're my problem.

Bitch, give my goddamn ring!

Oh, you want to get crazy?
I'm crazy, and I will fuck you up.

I'm sitting here trying
to mind my business...

Time for you to give my ring back.

Oh, hell no, nigga!
Fuck!

I'm sick and tired of you putting
your motherfucking hands on me!

I deal with too much to be dealing...
Here he go.

EARL:
Give me my shit, bitch!

Give me my fucking ring!

You want me to talk to him?

Give me my goddamn respect!
No.

I want my motherfucking respect!
We're not gonna go there.

EARL: Bitch, I will
choke you out of these braids.

Please don't.
(arguing continues)

He didn't used to be like this.

(Earl continues shouting)

Iraq fucked him up.

(Slim sighs)

I don't want to deal
with this shit.

Let's leave
first thing tomorrow.

You OK?
Yeah.

How is that possible?

You took somebody's life
yesterday.

I guess um...

I'm just used to saying
that I'm OK when I'm not.

I know the feeling.

What if God wanted me to die
and I messed up his plan?

I don't think
that's what he wanted.

How do you know?
I just...

I just think
you were meant to be here.

I'm making
an executive decision.

We're going to Cuba.
"Executive decision"?

We can't leave tomorrow
and not know where we're going.

What about that large body of water?
We'll figure it out.

(Queen sighs)

I'm scared.

That's all right.

I'll be brave enough
for the both of us.

Hey, uh...

why does your uncle owe you?

I got him out of prison once.

For what?

He killed somebody.
Damn. Who'd he kill?

My mother.

(panting quietly)

I'm rubbing your head
for good luck.

I don't believe in luck.

I think everything is destined.

(pounding on door in distance)

(dog howls in distance)

(rapid knocking)

(dog barks)

(pounding on door)

Who the fuck called you?


I'm just here to make sure
everybody's OK.

You still fucking this nigga?

No.
Why the fuck he here?

I ain't call him.
Why the fuck you here?

A neighbour heard some commotion
and got concerned.

Oh, shit, it's the cops.
Get down. Get down.

Don't worry.

I take real good care
of my property.

Do you?

Oh, yeah.

She my biggest draw.

You got a new truck?

EARL: I don't know
who the fuck truck that is.

You mind if I come in?

Not without a warrant, nigga.

You go get
your paperwork together.

I'll give you the grand tour.

Think I will come back
with that warrant.

Make sure you use
the large font.

I can't see shit.

Keep your hands
to yourself, Earl.

I didn't want you to come here
in the first motherfucking place.

Close the gate, nigga.

You know I'm gonna have to kill
that nigga one day, yeah?

Y'all need to get the fuck
out of here.

Shit.

QUEEN:
There's clothes in the closet.

Oh, shit.

(panting quietly)

Take this.

That should cover your gas
for most of the way.

And the man at that address
will take care of you.

His wife ain't shit,
but he cool.

Johnny Shepherd?

Who's he?

We served together.

I saved his life once.

He'll be expecting you.

And he got a friend
that got a plane

to get you over
that body of water.

Thank you, Uncle Earl.

Nigga, I ain't your uncle.

GODDESS:
Mm.

Take care of yourself.
You, too.

Take care of her.

Love you, baby girl.

QUEEN:
Love you, too.

You have to be honest all the time?

Do you want me to be silent?

(song fades)

What are you doing?
(music playing nearby)

Are you crazy?
I heard a band playing.

I wanted to see
where it was coming from.

We need to keep going.

I mean, I know,
but I'm exhausted.

You knocked out in the back
while I'm trying to stay awake.

Fine. I'll drive.

When was the last time
you heard some live music?

I don't know.

I mean, we're only
a few hours from Georgia,

so we got time.
(sighs)

Would you have gone
on a second date with me?

No.
Damn.

It's not personal.

I just like being alone.

I get it.

What would the second date
have been?

I'm not telling you.

Come on.
Don't do me like that.

Nah. You should've said yes.

OK, fine. I'll go.

It's too late now.

I have the right
to change my mind.

(engine starts)

OK, I'm officially saying yes to the
second date. Now, what are we doing?

(engine stops)

I'm taking you dancing.
Let's go.

Can we dance when we get
to where we're going?

Just to be safe?
I'm tired of playing it safe.

You're willing to risk
getting caught so we can dance?

Hell, yeah.


One dance, and we can leave.
I promise.

I'll buy you a drink.

Yeah. Come on.

You good?

Let's go.
We got to get a move on.

â™ª Pocketful Of Money

Hey! Yeah.

â™ª I got plenty money, babe

â™ª Just let me come inside

â™ª I got plenty money, baby

â™ª Just let me come inside

â™ª Well, I keep plenty money, babe

â™ª Just let me come inside

Why you so jumpy?
I'm nervous.

Ain't nobody out here
thinking about us.

â™ª I got plenty money, babe

â™ª Just let me come inside

â™ª Well, I got plenty money, baby

â™ª Just let me come inside...

Watch your hands.

â™ª I'll dump all my pockets
for you

â™ª Spin it a while

(both laughing)

â™ª Spin it a while

â™ª And we'll dance all night

â™ª When you see me comin'

â™ª Know I got a pocketful of money

â™ª When you see me comin'

Don't you owe me a drink?

â™ª I got a pocketful of money...

What you want?

Bourbon.
The expensive kind.

â™ª Well, girl, you can get it all

Hey, handsome.

Hi.

What can I get you?

A bourbon.
(bartender chuckles)

(song ends)
(cheering and applause)

Oh, I don't drink.

Maybe you should start.

Oh. These are on the house.

Oh, thank you.

Don't worry.
You're safe here.

â™ª Oh!

The bartender recognised me.

Oh, shit. We got to go.

I think we're good.
I don't know.

Trust me.

â™ª Hey, hey, hey, little girl

(grunts, chuckles)

â™ª Standin' out here by your door

â™ª Well, aren't you gonna
open up your door?

â™ª Or you gonna stand there
and act a fool?

â™ª Yeah, I'm wonderin',
I'm wonderin'

â™ª What road will you take
from here?

â™ª Yeah, I'm wonderin',
I'm wonderin'

â™ª What road will you take
from here?

(song fades)

SLIM:
What do you want?

QUEEN:
I want a guy to show me myself.

I want him to love me so deeply

I'm not afraid to show him
how ugly I can be.

I want him to show me scars
I never knew I had.

But I don't want him
to make them go away.

I want him to hold my hand
while I nurse them myself.

And I want him to cherish
the bruises they leave behind.

(muffled cheering and applause)

We should go.

QUEEN:
What do you want?

I want a ride-or-die.

Oh, my God.
What does that even mean?

I just want someone
that's always gonna love me

no matter what.

Someone that's gonna hold
my hand and never let it go.

She got to be special, though.

Cos she gonna be my legacy.

What do you mean?

Look, I ain't gonna
bend the world.

Long as my lady
remembers me fondly,

that's all I need.

â™ª I called you up,
but you weren't there

â™ª And I was broken-hearted

â™ª Hung up the phone,
can't be too late

â™ª The boss is so demanding

â™ª Opened the door up,
and to my surprise...

SLIM:
Skinny Luther or fat Luther?

Mm, skinny Luther.

Oh, fuck.
What?

See, I don't trust people
that like skinny Luther.

Skinny Luther was dope.


He had a lot more energy,

he sang better,
and his clothes fit.

You crazy as hell.
Fat Luther was the shit.

Look, who else you know
that can pull off a Jheri curl

and a three-piece suit
at the same damn time?

Nobody.

â™ª A thousand kisses from you
is never too much

â™ª Never too much,
never too much

â™ª Never too much

â™ª I just don't wanna stop

â™ª Oh, my love...

SLIM: What you doing? I thought
you said no more stopping.

QUEEN:
I changed my mind.

What you mean, you changed
your mind? We got to go.

Relax.
(shuts off engine)

Oh, f...

Hey. He's gonna get scared
and kick you in the face.

They're not wild.

Well, how you know?

My uncle used to take me
horseback riding when I was a kid.

Really?

He told me nothing scares
a white man more

than seeing a black man
on a horse.

Why?

Cos they have to
look up at him.

(Queen chuckles softly)

I never been on a horse.
(sighs)

You should try sometime.

Maybe I should do it right now.

You should try it
when we have more time.

I'll take you.
When?

I don't know.

What if you don't make it?

We will.
You don't know that.

I'm getting on a horse.

(Queen chuckles)
(Slim claps)

(Queen smacking lips)

(whispers): Come on.
(Slim sighs, sniffs)

SLIM: Ready?
Yeah.

Yeah, climb up on this side.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Got it?

That's right.

Yeah.

All right, hold on.

You got it?

(horse whinnies)

(Queen chuckling)

QUEEN:
It's nice, isn't it?

Yeah.
(Queen laughs)

MAN (in distance):
Hey!

Shit. Shit.
MAN: What are you doing?

QUEEN:
Let's go. Let's go.

MAN:
Get the fuck off my property!



Go, go, go, go, go, go.
(engine starts)

(Queen laughing)

â™ª FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI:
Shakara

(both laughing)

(both panting, sighing)

(engine sputtering,
steam hissing)

SLIM: Motherfuck.
QUEEN: Damn.

(music ends)

SLIM:
Oh... (groans)

(Queen exhales sharply)

I think I saw a body shop
somewhere back there.

Hell, that was a while ago.

Well, we need to get
the car fixed.

All right, get in the car.
I'll push.


(grunts forcibly)

MECHANIC:
Your radiator's fucked.

Your water pump, too.
That don't sound good.

I can probably get it
back to you tomorrow

for about two grand.
Two grand?

We need it back today.
Y'all in a rush?

Yeah, we're...
we're on our way to visit family.

Now, why y'all want to rush
to do that?


Well, I can probably
get it back for you tonight,

but it's gonna cost you
a little more.

How much more?
Another 500.

Come here. Come on.

That's all our money.
What's the alternative?

I ain't got all day.

We gonna do this or what?

Here. That's all we have.

SLIM: Need the car fixed
as soon as possible.

I'll work as fast as I can.

Can I use your bathroom?

Yeah.
It's right in through there.


(ringing tone)

MAN:
Hello?

Dad?

Are you OK, boy?

Yeah, I'm fine.

This ain't like you.

I know.


I just want to let you know
that I'm OK...

..and that I love you.

I love you, too, son.

We're trying to get to...
(click, dial tone)

Now, why would you do that?

Get out of my house.

You're under arrest
for helping a fugitive.

You do what you got to do.

Oh, we're gonna find him.

Yeah, but not with my help.

(music playing faintly on radio)

What you about to do now?

Oh, damn it!
(slams tool down)

Y'all are working on my nerves.

Why don't you go
take a walk or something?

We're not leaving you
with this car.

Don't nobody want to steal your car.
I just want to make sure.

Man, you got
bigger problems than me.

You know who we are?

I'm old, boy, not blind.
Then why not give us a discount?

Unlike the rest of these simple-ass
niggas, I don't approve of what y'all did.

We didn't have a choice.
That don't matter.

You gave them a licence to kill us.

He shot at me.

You gave him an excuse.
You weren't there.

No, I wasn't.

But if I was, I would've took
my ticket and been on my way.

Can you work more
and talk less?

I could work a lot faster
if you left me the fuck alone.

I'm not leaving you
with this car.


Damn! This is bullshit.

What about if I give you
some insurance?

I don't want no house keys
or no driver's licence,

cos all of that can be replaced.

Son.

Yes, sir?

How'd you like to take
these nice folks on a walk?

Yeah.

Um...

Yes, sir.

You keep 'em occupied till I finish
this car. Stay off the street.

I'm uh...

I know who you are.

What's your name?

Everybody call me Junior.

Hi.

It's an honour to meet y'all.

JUNIOR:
Going to a protest tomorrow.

SLIM: For what?
JUNIOR: To support you.

Can't believe
y'all are here, man.

I was just watching y'all,

like... like, on TV, and then...

now you walking
right next to me.

That shit is crazy.

Really hope y'all make it.

Yeah, me, too.

Just know, even if you don't,
it'll be OK.

QUEEN:
How so?

Cos then you'll be immortal.

SLIM:
I like that.

QUEEN:
I'd rather live.

JUNIOR:
I want to be immortal, too.

SLIM: You're too young to be
worried about all that.

JUNIOR:
No, I'm not.

I could die today.

SLIM:
Don't say that.

JUNIOR: I just want people
to know I was here.

QUEEN: As long as your family
knows you were here,

that's all that matters.

(engine starts)
(Queen and Slim sigh)

Yo, Junior.

Could you take our picture?
(closes door)

Yeah.
(car door opens)

I don't think
that's a good idea.

Come on.

I want proof we were here.


Right here.

(camera clicks)

(tyres squealing)

SLIM:
Yo.

Yo.

Do you mind
if we make a detour?

Uh... I do, actually.

You OK?

Not really.

QUEEN: We were close
when I was younger.

But as I got older,
I felt like...

I didn't know her any more.

She didn't know me, either.

We could go months
without talking.

And when we did, I hated it.

I had nothing to say to her.

She wanted a connection
so badly.

And I just didn't care.

I didn't need her any more.

(Queen shudders)

(sighs, sniffles)

(sniffles, sighs)

My grandmother
left the house to both of them.

My mom wanted to sell it.

My uncle wanted to live in it.

Typical family bullshit.

SLIM:
Mm-hmm.

One night, they were
up at the house, fighting.

He was really fucked-up.

He pushed her.

She fell down a flight
of stairs, cracked her skull.

She bled out so quick,

by the time
the ambulance got there,

she was already dead.

I had just passed the Bar.

I was desperate
to try my first case. I...

I never thought
that that would be it.

How could you defend the person

that killed your own mother?
(Queen sighs)

(voice breaking):
I knew it was an accident.

Does it ever piss you off
that he's alive and she isn't?

(exhales sharply)

All the time.

(sobbing softly)

(Queen taking deep breaths)

(protesters clamouring)

MAN (chanting):
Let them go! Let them go!

WOMAN:
Stop shooting us!

MAN: Stop shooting us!
WOMAN: Not one more!

PROTESTERS (chanting):
Let them go! Let them go!

Let them go!

Let them go! Let them go!
(indistinct shouting)

Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!


You're gonna pay every shot!

(clamouring continues)

Stay back.
Stand back.

Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!

Let them go!
We got to fight the power, man!

Let them go! Let them go!
Let them go!

Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

Let them go!

Let them go! Let them go!

Let them go! Let them go!
(officer shouts)

Let them go! Let them go!

OFFICER:
Get back. Please, back.

â™ª Can't keep runnin' away...

Stop killing us!

Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

(gas hissing)
Stop killing us!

(protesters screaming)

(clamouring continues)

OFFICER:
Stop resisting! Stop!

(panting, moaning)

â™ª Can't keep runnin' away


(clamouring)
Get off our street, man!


â™ª Can't keep runnin'...

Let's go!

Come on!

I'm ready.

Come fucking shoot me!
Come on!

Come get me!

(Queen gasping, moaning)

â™ª Can't keep runnin'...

You need to get out of here.

If you don't vacate
the premises,

I will arrest you, son.
I'm not your son.

What's your name, young man?
I ain't got to tell you that.

I'm not trying to hurt you,
just to clear these streets and do my job.

You're not supposed to be here.
So what you gonna do, shoot me?

You gonna shoot me if I don't leave?
No, but I will arrest you.

Listen, man, I'm begging you.

Just go home, all right?

What you...

(gasping, moaning)

(Queen squeals)
(Slim grunting)

â™ª Can't keep runnin'

â™ª Can't keep runnin' away

â™ª Oh...

(birds chirping)

(engine shuts off)

(doorbell chimes)

And a young man was killed.

His father came out
and said he fixed your car.

What do you mean,
he was killed?

MRS SHEPHERD: He shot
a police officer in the face.

We were just with him.

MR SHEPHERD:
You knew the boy?

We spent some time
with him, but...

MRS SHEPHERD:
Did you order him to do it?

Are you crazy?
We would never do that.

Well, these kids, they think it's OK
to kill cops cos of you.

Who made it OK
for cops to kill us?

We didn't want this.

There's a war going on
out there,

and you welcome this
into our home?

They didn't start it.

I want them gone
by the morning.

We can leave right now.

MR SHEPHERD:
Hey, hey.

Don't let your pride
get you killed.

I ain't staying here.

Look, I got hiding spots
all over this place.

Even if the cops come,
they won't find you.

This is a safe place.
Right?

Y'all hungry?

Come on.

There's a bounty out
on your heads.

How much we worth?

250.
Total?

Each.
That ain't much.

It's enough to pay
our mortgage off.

You gonna turn us in?
No.

Earl told me you need a plane.

Yeah.

I know a guy in Florida.

Already gave him a call.

This is his address
and directions to his house.

If you lose that,
you're fucked.

Let's eat before it gets cold.

MR SHEPHERD:
I'll lead us in prayer.

May I?

Course.

I'd like to start by thanking God
for the breath in my lungs.

I'm grateful that we have
a place to sleep tonight,

food to put in our bellies.

Thank you for bringing us
this far.

Thank you for this journey...

..no matter how it ends.

Amen.

SHEPHERDS:
Amen.

(chewing quietly)

Get upstairs now.

What's going on?
Just go.

Get under the bed in our room.

Take the back stairs.

Police! Police!
(Mrs Shepherd screams)

OFFICER: Hands on the table!
Tell us where they are!

Living room, clear!

May I help you?
Hands on the table!

Tell us where they are.
OFFICER: Upstairs!

Who's "they"?

OFFICER:
Go, go.

Right side, clear.

Closet, clear.



Clear!

(police radio chatter)

You tell us where they went,
we'll let you go,

and you can enjoy
the rest of your evening.

How can I tell you where they
went if they were never here?

Then where'd the fancy car
come from?

People park their cars
around here all the time.

You look a lot smarter
than your husband.

You want to tell me
where they went?

(helicopter passing overhead)

OFFICER:
Sergeant.

leave here at some point.

I'm not trying to walk
into an ambush.

I heard cars leave hours ago.

I'm sure they left some folks behind
to keep an eye on the house.

Stay here and die of starvation if you
want but I'm getting the fuck out of here.

(door creaking)

They got to be out front.

We got to jump.

I mean, it's too high.

What you got to do
is bend your knees

when you hit the ground, OK?

Bend and roll.

This ain't no damn fire drill.


All right. Hold on.

Be careful. Careful.

QUEEN:
OK.

(grunts, groans)

Fuck.


(grunting, panting)


(Queen panting, whimpering)

All right?

We... We need to move.

We need to move.
I'm gonna need you to get up.

I'm gonna need you to get up,
all right?

Lean on me. Lean on me.
Lean on me. Lean on me.

(panting, shuddering)

Almost there. Stay here.
I'm a check out front. OK?

(Queen gasping, whimpering)

(groaning, gasping)

Sit down here. Sit down here.
Sit down here.

Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

(door creaking)

OK, I know how to do this.

But you got to promise not to scream.
Can you do that?

I believe in you. Hm?

I think there are cops out front.

If they hear you, it's over, we're done.

(exhales sharply)

I know how strong you are.

You can do this. Yeah?

Wait. Give me your jacket.

Here. Take that.

All right.
(sniffling)


All right. OK.
(muffled whimpering)

All right.

One...
(muffled whimpering)

..two...

(shushing quietly)

(joint cracks)
(muffled scream)

(shushing)
(muffled sobbing)

It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. OK.

(birds chirping)
(wind whistling softly)

Did you hear that?
Hear what?

Sounds like somebody's crying.

No. That's just nature.

City boys ain't used to that shit.

Don't refer to me as "boy."
I ain't no boy.

You know what I meant.
I know the difference

between a person
and an animal, too.

Then go walk around.

Better watch
how you talk to me, man.

Ooh, touchy, touchy.

I need to find a screwdriver.
You know how to boost a car?

I used to. My older brother
taught me one summer.

Toolbox.

(Slim exhales sharply)

Only car we ever stole
was my dad's.

He should've known better
than to leave that Acura around us.

(Slim panting rapidly)

(Slim panting rapidly)

Damn it. Fuck.

(prolonged beep)
(ignition sputtering)

(ignition sputtering)

(engine starts)

(both sigh)

Now, how we supposed
to get out of here?

What was it?

Couple of deer
caught in some branches.

I set 'em free.

Told you.


(Queen panting softly)

(takes deep breath)

Yo, what you doing?


Are you crazy?
Get back in the car.


F-Fuck.




Are you trying to die?

No. I just always wanted
to do that.

Well, don't do it
while I'm driving, OK?

You should try it.
Nah, I'm good.

Pull over.
Nuh-uh.

Come on, pull over.

Pull over.

If I do it, will you please

let me drive
the rest of the way in peace?

Swear to God.

Swear on something
you believe in.

OK, fine.
I'll swear on you.



Fuck, man.

Shit.
(Queen laughing)

Oh, shit!

Oh, shit!
Fuck it. I'm coming back in.

No, no, no. You got it.
You got it. You're good.

I'll just drive slow.

(both laughing)

â™ª Brand-new Cedes Benz...
(engine stops)

(music fades)
(crickets chirping)

Will you please get back
in the car before you get shot?

Ain't nobody here.


I was hoping we'd pull up
to a house and get some sleep.

Well, there isn't one.
I can see that.

They're gonna find us.
No, they're not.

How about you get in the back
and get some sleep?

I'll sit here. Huh?

Make sure nobody kills us.

(Queen sighs)

Take that.

Thanks.

(takes deep breath)

(crickets chirping, water lapping gently)


I can't sleep.

You want me to turn on
the radio?

No.

I want you to tell me a story.

What kind of story?

Any story. I don't care.

When I was little, I asked
my mom where babies come from.

She said I was
too young to know.

Then I asked my dad.

And he said, "Babies are
a product of two people

that needed something
from each other."

So I said, "Needed what?"

He said, "Maybe they needed
to feel seen.

"Maybe they needed
to feel loved.

Maybe they needed
to feel human."

And then what?

Then I asked my grandmother.

She said, "Babies come from God.

They're his way of making sure
no one ever really dies."

I remember her saying,

"Through our children,
we are reborn."

Then I went
to my older brother,

and I asked him.

And he said,

"Nobody knows.
You're just born.

That's it.
Now leave me alone."

(Queen chuckles)

I wasn't satisfied with
that answer, either, but...

I ran out of
family members to ask,

so he got the last word.

So, who was right?

None of 'em.

Babies come from fucking.

Plain and simple.

(both gasp)

Why y'all acting
all scared and shit?

Cos you pointing a gun
in my face.

Man, I was just fucking
with you, player.

Come on.

You know the Shepherds?

Hell, yeah.

Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

How we know you ain't lying?

I mean, you don't.

Then why should we go with you?

What other choice do you have?

Well, how you know
the Shepherds?

From way back.
How long?

Damn, man, why you giving me
the third degree?

I'm trying to help you out.

They said you had a plane.
They lied about that one.

Well, if you ain't got a plane,
we not going with you.

Look, man,
I ain't got that kind of money.

But I got a friend that do.

He a baller. He can get you
whatever you want.

When we get to my trailer,
I'll give him a call for you.

Why can't you call him

Cos I ain't got
my phone on me.

Damn!

Look, y'all can either
roll with me

or stand here like some dummies

and wait for the police
to come get you.

â™ª I put the foreground of life

OFFICER:

(heavy gunfire)

â™ª Hollow one...

GAYLE KING: Angela Johnson
and Ernest Hines

were shot and killed today
by Monroe County Police.

The two suspects
have become quite infamous

for their ability to escape
authorities across state lines

after killing Officer Reed
in Cleveland, Ohio.

Monroe County Police Department
released a statement

saying they had hoped
to arrest the suspects

so that they could have
their day in court,

but they had no choice
but to open fire

because the suspects were armed
and considered dangerous.

It was a tragic ending to
a six-day nationwide manhunt.

The pursuit that began in Ohio
ended on a Florida tarmac,

yards away from a jet plane

intended to be
their final escape.

Despite the two
being wanted for murder,

hundreds of thousands of people
across the nation

pledged their support,
gathering in the streets,

protesting against
the fallen officer

who shot and killed
an unarmed black man

just two years ago
in an unrelated incident.

Johnson and Hines became
a social media phenomenon,

Dashcam footage links them

to the shooting death
of an officer.

â™ª If lovelessness

â™ª Is godlessness

â™ª Will you cast me

â™ª To the wayside?

â™ª Well, I feel the peeling

â™ª Of half-painted ceilings

â™ª Reveal the covering

â™ª Of a blank sky

â™ª Am I vital

â™ª If my heart is idle?

â™ª Am I doomed?

â™ª Cradle me

â™ª So I can see

â™ª If I'm doomed...

(muffled, echoing laughter)

(indistinct chattering)
