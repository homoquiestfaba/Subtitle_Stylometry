WHITNEY HOUSTON JUST DIED.
WHAT'S THAT?

WHITNEY HOUSTON
JUST DIED.

THAT'S A JOKE.
all: NO.

WHITNEY HOUSTON
JUST DIED?

SHIT. HOUSTON,
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

TOO SOON!
TOO SOON?

APPARENTLY NOT.

[guitar riff]
HEY.

LOOK OUT, EVERYBODY.

JEFF ROSS HERE.

YEAH!
HOLA!

WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP?

I'M HEADING OUT
ON MY FIRST NATIONAL TOUR,

ROASTING MY WAY
AROUND AMERICA...

HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GONNA
GET ROASTED BY THE MASTER?

IF YOU'RE PREGNANT
OR WEIRD-LOOKING...

YOU HAVE
A CIVIC OBLIGATION...

TO GET 15 SECONDS OF PAIN,
IF YOUR SKIN IS THICK ENOUGH.

VOLUNTEER ONLY.

HERE WE [bleep] GO.

FINDING OUT
WHO CAN TAKE IT...

LISTEN,
SLUMDOG THOUSAND-AIRE.

YOU'RE LIKE
A SITCOM BLACK DUDE.

YOU'RE NOT
A REGULAR BLACK DUDE.

LOOK AT THAT!

AND WHO CAN'T.

AAH! OW!

WHOO! OW!

LET FREEDOM ZING...
[mic thuds]

AND LET THE ROASTING BEGIN!

MY FIRST STOP
WAS MY SECOND HOME, SEATTLE.

I WARMED UP BACKSTAGE
BY ROASTING MY NEPHEW, JARED,

RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
IF YOU GROW UP?

NICE OUTFIT, I DIDN'T KNOW
BABY GAP HAD WOMEN'S CLOTHES.

JARED LOOKS LIKE JUSTIN BIEBER
IF HE CUT HIS OWN HAIR.

THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

BEHAVE OR I'LL DROP YOU OFF
AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY.

PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER
FOR THE ROASTMASTER GENERAL,

JEFFREY ROSS, EVERYBODY.
[cheers and applause]

THIS WORKED OUT.
THANK YOU, SEATTLE.

I GOT A HAIRCUT
FOR YOU PEOPLE.

I TOLD THE GUY, "MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE GADDAFI'S NEPHEW."

IT ALMOST RAINED TODAY,
DIDN'T IT, SEATTLE?

ALMOST.

HOW MANY DAYS A WEEK DOES IT--
YOU THINK IT RAINS HERE?

all: SEVEN!

SEVEN DAYS A WEEK?

YOU PEOPLE ARE WETTER
THAN WHITNEY HOUSTON

IN A BEVERLY HILLS
HOTEL BATHTUB.

YOU PEOPLE--

TOO SOON!
NEVER TOO SOON, SIR.

HOW [bleep] STONED
ARE THESE MOTHER[bleep]?

PEOPLE SMOKE POT
IN SEATTLE?

[crowd cheers]
YEE-HAW!

YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING WHILE
YOU'RE HOLDING IN POT SMOKE

AND IT MAKES IT OKAY,
RIGHT?


MOM'S DEAD.



UH-OH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT IT.

I WANT TO STICK MY PINKIE
IN YOUR ASS[bleep].

I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

I INVITED COURTNEY LOVE,
BUT SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

SHE TOLD ME
SHE'S WRITING HER BOOK.

THAT'S GONNA BE
A CAN'T-REMEMOIR.

THAT PLOT'S
GONNA HAVE MORE HOLES

THAN KURT COBAIN'S GARAGE.

[laughter and groans]

TOO SOON FOR THE KURT JOKES,
SEATTLE?

I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK,
BUT I BET IT ENDS WITH A BANG.

ALL APOLOGIES.

HOW FAR DOES BILL GATES
LIVE FROM HERE?

BILL GATES IS SO RICH,

HE WIPES HIS ASS
WITH SEAHAWKS TICKETS.

BILL GATES IS SO RICH,
HE'S 100% OF THE 1% OF THE 1%.

BILL GATES IS SO RICH,

HE HIRED CANCER
TO KILL STEVE JOBS.

THIS IS MY GUITAR
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

I CONSIDER IT
AN OLD FRIEND.

WHEN I'M ON THE ROAD,
I BRING IT WITH ME,

AND, UH,
IT KEEPS ME COMPANY.

STEVE JOBS WAS A GREAT AMERICAN,
AND THAT ONE--

THAT ONE WAS--

AT HIS FUNERAL, HIS FAMILY MADE
THIS ELABORATE TRIBUTE VIDEO,

AND THEN IT DIDN'T WORK
'CAUSE YOU NEEDED FLASH.

[strumming guitar riff]

â™ª

THEY PUT HIM IN
THIS REALLY EXPENSIVE COFFIN.

THEN THEY PAID EXTRA
FOR A PLASTIC CASE

TO PROTECT IT
FROM SCRATCHES.

DID YOU SEE HIM?
HE WAS THINNER THAN THE iPAD 2

AT THE END THERE.

[playing guitar]

â™ª

EVERYBODY WANTED TO
WORK FOR STEVE JOBS,

EXCEPT HIS PANCREAS.

â™ª

STEVE JOBS,
ROAST IN PEACE.

[cheers and applause]

I MADE A CHALLENGE
THAT I WOULD TRY

SPEED-ROASTING VOLUNTEERS
FROM THE AUDIENCE.

I DON'T PICK ON PEOPLE.
IT HAS TO BE VOLUNTEER ONLY.

15 SECONDS OF PAIN,
SEATTLE.

WHOEVER WANTS TO COME UP,
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

I'LL TAKE THE FIRST, LIKE,
EIGHT PEOPLE OR SOMETHING.

OKAY, HOLD ON,
THAT'S ENOUGH DUDES.

WAIT A SECOND.

ALL RIGHT, JUST WOMEN NOW.
JUST WOMEN ONLY.

WOMEN ONLY.
ALL RIGHT.

OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS

WHAT'S UP?
I LOVE YOU, JEFF!

OH, MY GO--OH!

POP! POP!
YOU'RE SO SEXY.

OH, MY GOD, WOW.

SOMEBODY GET HER
A BLACK [bleep] FAST.

OW! OW!

LOOK AT THIS GAY NAZI
OVER HERE.

HEIL HITLER!

COME ON, DO IT WITH ME.
DO IT WITH ME.

HEIL HITLER!

[indistinct shout]
[laughs]

AND THIS GUY,
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

I SAW YOU AT THE THEATER
WHEN I WALKED BY

AT, LIKE,
WHAT TIME TODAY?

UH, I THINK IT WAS,
LIKE, 2:00.

THIS GUY GOT TO
THE THEATER AT 2:00.

I THOUGHT HE WAS
A REALLY BIG FAN,

TURNS OUT
HE'S [bleep] HOMELESS.

WHAT DO YOU DO?
UH, I'M A LASER OPERATOR.

A WHAT?
A LASER OPERATOR.

YOU MUST
GET TONS OF [bleep].

JUST ONE.

JUST ONE?
YEAH.

YOU HAVE A WIFE?
UM, IN A COUPLE MONTHS.

OH, YOU'RE GONNA--
YOU'RE ENGAGED?

YES.
WOW, WHAT DOES SHE DO?

SHE--
I KNOW SHE'S NOT A DENTIST.

YOU ASKED FOR THIS, BUDDY.
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T--

NO, HEY, HEY.

COME HERE, LADIES.

LET'S CHECK YOU OUT
FOR A SECOND.

TWO FIVES
MAKE A TEN, RIGHT?

RIGHT!
[laughs]

YEAH! WE'RE DOING IT!
WE'RE [bleep] DOING IT!

WOW.

YOU HAVE SUCH A SWEET FACE.
AW, THANK YOU.

ARE YOU, LIKE, MISSING
A CHROMOSOME OR SOMETHING?

YEAH, FOR SURE.
FOR SURE.

BUT--BUT IT MAKES EVERYTHING
SO MUCH BETTER.

I FEEL YOU.
I COULD SEE THAT.

I COULD TOTALLY SEE THAT.
GOOD.

I LOVE YOU GUYS.
AND LOOK AT YOU.

YOU STOLE A TABLECLOTH
FROM CHUCK E. CHEESE.

HEY, MAN, IT'S A RECESSION.
IT'S A RECESSION.

YOU TALKING ABOUT
YOUR TITS?


OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT.

I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU BOTH
MY SPACE NEEDLE.

BET YOUR [bleep]
SMELL LIKE PIKE'S PLACE.

TAKE A BOW, YOU GUYS.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR SEATS.

SUPER, SUPER COOL OF YOU LADIES
TO COME UP HERE.

GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PUBIC HAIRS
COMING IN.

ALL RIGHT, ANY TIME NOW.

LOVE YOU.
THANK YOU, DARLING.

SECURITY, ESCORT HER
BACK TO MY HOTEL ROOM, PLEASE.

A COLD, BEAUTIFUL DAY
IN TORONTO.

NO ROASTING OF AMERICA
WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A STOP

AT OUR COUSIN'S BACKYARD
TO THE NORTH.

OUR BIG, DUMB COUSIN,
CANADA.

IT'S KIND OF LIKE
VISITING THE FAMILY.

IT'S KIND OF
AN OBLIGATION.

GOTTA REMIND THESE CANADIANS
WHO'S BOSS.


THIS ISN'T A ROAST,
IT'S A THAW.

MY [bleep] IS INSIDE MY STOMACH
RIGHT NOW,

IT'S SO COLD OUT THERE.

UH, I WATCHED A CANADIAN
PORNO MOVIE YESTERDAY.

THAT WAS COOL.

TWO GIRLS,
ONE STANLEY CUP.

LAST TIME
I WAS IN MONTREAL,

CELINE DION HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH
TO IDENTICAL TWINS,

WHICH WAS QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT
GIVEN HER AGE AND FACE.

TOO SOON
FOR THE CELINE DION JOKES?

THERE GOES
MY MICHAEL J. FOX ROUTINE.

I'M NOT MAKING FUN
OF MICHAEL J. FOX.

THAT'S SHAKY GROUND
RIGHT THERE.


OH, MY--HEY,
HOW ABOUT A HAND FOR THE BAND,

DOING A GREAT JOB TONIGHT.

IF YOU'RE PREGNANT
OR WEIRD-LOOKING,

YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO YOUR FELLOW CANADIANS

TO COME ONSTAGE RIGHT NOW.

ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD.

WOW, THIS IS WORKING OUT.
COME ON.

HOLY SHIT,
LET'S TALK TO THIS GUY.

COME OVER HERE, SIR.

SIR, WHEN I ASKED FOR PREGNANT
PEOPLE TO COME ONSTAGE,

I WASN'T TRYING TO
REFER TO YOU,

BUT--COME HERE.
COME HERE, DOLL.

LET'S JUST--
LET'S JUST COMPARE YOU TWO.

YOU GUYS ARE--JUST RUB BELLIES.
JUST RUB BELLIES A LITTLE BIT.

THE THREE OF US.
THE THREE OF US.

YOU GUYS ARE ALL SO CUTE.

COME HERE, HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
AMANDA.

AMANDA. YOU ARE SO
SEXILY PREGNANT RIGHT NOW.

THANKS.
WHO'S THE BABY DADDY?

HE'S OUT THERE.

THIS WOMAN IS TOO PREGNANT
TO BE OUT IN PUBLIC RIGHT NOW.

I'M SO H--CAN I TOUCH?
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

A BOY.
OH, THAT'S AWESOME.

I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THEY SAY

IT'S VERY HEALTHY
FOR THE BABY'S DEVELOPMENT

TO HEAR PEOPLE LAUGHING,
TO HEAR THE MOTHER LAUGHING.

THAT'S RIGHT.

IMAGINE IF I WAS
LICKING YOUR [bleep] RIGHT NOW,

HOW GOOD THAT WOULD BE
FOR THE UNBORN BABY.

WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

SURE.

MMM, I GOTTA JERK OFF AGAIN.
HOLD ON A SECOND.


OH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
COME HERE.

YOU ARE SO--
LOOK AT YOU.

WOW, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WERE

ON THE WAY HERE.

WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS [bleep] OUTFIT?

IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

DID YOU MAKE IT IN OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED, EXACTLY?

THEY RIPPED YOUR--
HALF YOUR DRESS OFF.

I WANT TO BITE YOUR SHOULDER
RIGHT NOW.

YOU'RE A CREEP.

WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
SARAH.

SARAH WITH AN "H"?
YES.

OH, I GOTTA JERK OFF.

WHAT DO YOU DO
ALL DAY, SARAH?

A STUDENT.
OH, YEAH?

OF WHAT?
MBA.

I KNOW
IT'S NOT FASHION.

all: OH!

IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, SARAH.

YOU'RE HERE
AMONGST FRIENDS TODAY.

MISS, IT WAS GREAT
TO MEET YOU.

HONEY, I'LL SEE YOU--WHEN?
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU?

AFTER THE SHOW.
AFTER THE SHOW?

DO YOU EVER SUCK [bleep]
FOR COKE?

HOW ABOUT DIET PEPSI?
DO YOU TAKE DIET PEPSI?

MAMALA, THANK YOU
FOR BEING A GOOD SPORT.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING UP HERE

WHEN I ASKED FOR
A VOLUNTEER.

GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BABY
AND YOUR DADDY.

OH, THAT WAS SO FUN.

WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS
A REPUTATION FOR BEING UPTIGHT.

THAT WASN'T THE CASE WITH
THE PEOPLE I WAS RUNNING INTO.

HEY, HONEST ABE!

WANT TO COME HEAR ME
ROAST ABE LINCOLN?

LAST TIME I ROASTED
SOMEBODY THIS STONED,

IT WAS CHARLIE SHEEN.

ABE, YOU WERE AMERICA'S
BEST PRESIDENT EVER,

AND OUR
WORST THEATERGOER EVER.

TOO SOON, TOO SOON.

TOO SOON?
 all: TOO SOON.

I HEARD THAT PLAY
WAS SO BAD,

HE WAS HOPING
TO GET SHOT IN THE HEAD.

[laughter and groans]

TOO SOON,
TOO SOON, TOO SOON.

OF COURSE,
ABE LINCOLN FREED THE SLAVES.

IS THAT WHY ALL BLACK PEOPLE
DRIVE LINCOLNS?

NOW I'M GONNA GO ROAST
MARTIN LUTHER KING.

COME ON!
YEAH!

I HEARD THAT THEY
JUST APPROVED MEDICAL MARIJUANA

HERE IN WASHINGTON TOO.
IS THAT TRUE?

IT'LL BE
A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

DOCTORS WILL START
ADVERTISING ON TV.

"DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE
SLEEPING 12-14 HOURS A NIGHT?"

SOMETIMES I WAKE UP
AFTER NINE OR TEN HOURS.

"ARE CARTOONS NOT AS FUNNY
AS THEY USED TO BE?"

WE'RE IN A POLITICAL AREA.

DO YOU GUYS THINK, UH,
THE PRESIDENT

SHOULD GET HIS JOB BACK?

NO!
[scattered boos]

REALLY?

HE GETS A LOT OF CREDIT
FOR, UH, BEING ON THE LOOKOUT

FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND KILLING
THAT MOTHER[bleep], RIGHT?

OSAMA BIN LADEN, LIVING IN
THAT RUN-DOWN COMPOUND

FOR YEARS

WITH HIS 3 WIVES
AND 11 KIDS.

I HAVE A THEORY
THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN

CALLED THE NAVY SEALS
HIMSELF.

"SOMEBODY [bleep] KILL ME

"BEFORE I DO SOMETHING CRAZY.

"I'M AT
1313 [gibberish] BOULEVARD,

"ABBOTTABAD.

A-A-A-B-B-B-A-A-
B-B-A-A-A-A-

B-B-B-A-A-B-A
AS IN AAH!

ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO
COME ONSTAGE.

IT HAS TO BE
VOLUNTEER ONLY.

THIS IS GONNA BE--
LOOK AT THIS GUY, WOW.

YOU GOT [bleep] BALLS
FOR COMING OUT.

THAT'S [bleep] AWESOME.

YOU COULD STAY.
YOUR BUDDY COULD STAY.

HOLY SHIT.
THIS IS TOO [bleep]--

OH, MY GOD,
WHEN DID HAROLD [bleep] KUMAR?

LOOK AT THIS, WE GOT THE [bleep]
BOB'S BIG BOY UP HERE.

THE F--

HOLY SHIT, YOU GOT
THE BIGGEST TITS UP HERE.

WHAT'S UP, MAN, HOW YOU DOING?
WHAT'S UP, BRO?

NICE TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.

ARE YOU REALLY
ON THE REDSKINS?

DAMN RIGHT.

WHAT POSITION DO YOU PLAY?


BOTTOM?

YOU GOT BRASS BALLS
COMING UP HERE

TO GET [bleep]
SPEED-ROASTED.

THIS GUY HAS SEEN
MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE

THAN I'M EVER GONNA SEE

OR MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER SEE
IN THEIR LIVES.

I TALK SHIT FOR A LIVING.

I LIVE IN A COUNTRY
WHERE FREE SPEECH

IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO ME.

SO THESE GUYS OVER HERE,

AND THIS [bleep]
TOUGH MANIAC OVER HERE,

PROTECTS MY RIGHT
FOR FREE SPEECH.

[cheers and applause]
YEAH.

YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
FROM THE HOSPITAL

EVER TO COME UP ONSTAGE
DURING ONE OF MY SHOWS,

AND HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE [bleep] HAPPENED TO YOU,

BUT THIS IS A LONG WAY TO GO
TO LOSE WEIGHT.

I KNOW, RIGHT?

I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING
A [bleep] BLAST.

I DID, IN AFGHANISTAN.
WHAT?

I SAID I DID HAVE A BLAST,
IN AFGHANISTAN.

[laughs]

AWESOME.

FUNNY MOTHER[bleep].

I WAS EXPECTING
TO TAKE A BOW.

TAKE A BOW?

I'LL TAKE ONE WITH YOU.
YOU READY?

WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER--
HOLY SHIT.

SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA [bleep] THIS GUY.

HEAR YE, HEAR YE!

ALL THAT TALK
ABOUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

MADE ME WANT
TO TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT.

SO I TOOK THE DAY OFF

AND HEADED TO
THE SUNSHINE STATE.

YOU ALL LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL.

WHOOP.

FORGET SPEED-ROASTING,
I WAS ROASTING IN MY SPEEDO.

[disco music]

â™ª

USA! USA! USA!

SIR, PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON
AND EXIT THE WATER IMMEDIATELY.

â™ª

AM I IN TROUBLE?

YEAH, YOU ARE.
FOR WHAT?

PLEASE STOP THE FILMING.

YOU DO NOT HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO FILM ME.

STEP OVER TO
THE LIFEGUARD TOWER, PLEASE.

AND LET'S NOT MAKE A SCENE

BEFORE THEY PULL UP
THE PADDY WAGON.

all: ROSS! ROSS! ROSS!

UH-OH, BUSTED
FOR DESECRATION OF THE FLAG?

WELL, I TALKED TO THE COPS, AND
THEY LET ME OFF WITH A WARNING.

APPARENTLY, IT'S STILL
ILLEGAL TO ROCK OUT

WITH YOUR [bleep] OUT
IN THIS COUNTRY.

JEFF ROSS!

NEXT STOP, MINNEAPOLIS.

EVERY DAY'S
ANOTHER ADVENTURE, YOU KNOW?

YOU PASS THROUGH PLACES
THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN,

AND YOU PASS THROUGH PLACES
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN.

SO THERE'S ALWAYS
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT EMOTIONS

EVERY SINGLE DAY.

WHEN I WAS 17, I HAD SEX
WITH SOMEBODY NAMED KAYLA,

AND SHE TRACKED ME DOWN
THROUGH MY WEBSITE

AND SAID SHE WANTED TO
COME SAY HI,

SO I THINK SHE'LL BE THERE,

WHICH IS, UH, COOL
AND WEIRD, AND, UH,

I GUESS KIND OF FUNNY.

I KNOW YOU GUYS
CAN TAKE A JOKE,

AND I'M SORRY
THAT THE, UH, VIKINGS

AREN'T IN
THE SUPER BOWL TOMORROW.

THAT'S--
[scattered boos]

I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT LOOK,

AT LEAST YOUR WNBA TEAM
WINS EVERY [bleep] CHAMPIONSHIP.

[cheers and applause]

WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?
all: LYNX!

THE LYNX?

MORE LIKE MISSING LINKS,
WHAT THE [bleep]?

THEY'RE [bleep] 8 FEET TALL,
THOSE [bleep] WOMEN.

THEY'RE AWESOME THOUGH.

THEY'RE THE ONLY TEAM
FROM MINNESOTA

THAT DOESN'T
PLAY LIKE GIRLS.

I HAVE SO MUCH--
[woman] I LOVE YOU, JEFF ROSS!

THANK YOU, SIR.

I LOVE YOU TOO, SIR.

I LOST MY VIRGINITY
TO SOMEBODY FROM ST. LOUIS PARK.

ARE YOU HERE?

COME HERE,
SAY HI FOR A SECOND.

HOLY SHIT,
THIS IS NUTS.

WOW, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

THAT IS SO CRAZY.

YOU TURNED OUT
A LOT BETTER THAN I DID.

WOW.

YOU WANT TO TELL THE STORY
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

IT'LL BE REALLY FUN.

[laughs]

IS THIS OKAY
THAT I'M DOING THIS?

DOES IT MATTER?
NO.

YOU GOT A BABY!

THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.

THAT WOULD BE CRAZY
IF MY, LIKE, 20-YEAR-OLD SON

CAME DOWN THOSE STEPS
RIGHT NOW.

IT'S THE DUDE
WITH THE BEER.

DON'T EVEN [bleep] WITH ME
RIGHT NOW.

TOO SOON, TOO SOON.

THE WAY I REMEMBER IT,
YOU SAID TO YOUR FRIEND SUE,

"I WANT TO LOSE MY VIRGINITY,
AND THAT GUY JEFF

"JUST HAPPENED TO BE
OVER AT YOUR HOUSE,

SO I'M GONNA [bleep]
THAT GUY TONIGHT."

I WAS JUST SOME FAT LOSER
WITH BRACES.

NO, NO,
YOU WERE CUTE BACK THEN.

[both laugh]

YOU HAD A MISSION,
AND I HAPPENED TO BE THE LUCKY,

VERY LUCKY GUY

WHO GOT TO PUT HIS 17-YEAR-OLD,

3-INCH PENIS

INSIDE YOUR FOOT-LONG-DEEP,

18-YEAR-OLD,

SWEET, SUPER-TIGHT,
DELICIOUS--

YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE,
YOUR FIRST TIME,

AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY AWKWARD,
BUT I REMEMBER IT, IN THE END,

LIKE, VERY BEAUTIFUL,
AND A VERY FOND MEMORY

OF HAVING SEX WITH YOU
FOR 15 SECONDS

IN SUE ARBETTER'S
PARENTS'...

PARENTS' BED.
BED.

[both laugh]

WHICH BEGS
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION,

WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

THAT WAS SO AWESOME.

THANK YOU, KAYLA.

WOW, WHAT THE HECK
JUST HAPPENED?

HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN WATCHING
THAT AIDS DOCUMENTARY ON FOX?

all: NO.

I THINK IT'S CALLED <i>GLEE.</i>

I HOPE THOSE KIDS ARE OKAY,
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

BY THE TIME I GOT TO WISCONSIN,
I WAS IN FULL ROAST MODE.

MADISON, HOLY SHIT,
YOU PEOPLE ARE FAT.

NO OFFENSE.
WHAT DO YOU PUT IN THE WATER?

CHOLESTEROL?

I LOST MY VIRGINITY FROM SOMEONE
FROM MINNESOTA.

I MOTORBOATED A DUDE TODAY.
IT WAS CRAZY.

YOU ARE FAT, WISCONSIN.

LOOK AT ME.

[cheers and applause]

THIS IS SO CRAZY,
WHAT ARE YOU?

COME HERE A SECOND.

LOOK AT THAT!

WAIT, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!

OH, MY GOD,
COME UP HERE, FELLAS.

LET'S [bleep] TURN THIS INTO
<i>ERNEST GOES TO A COMEDY SHOW.</i>

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU GUYS

LIKE COUSINS DO,
WISCONSIN STYLE.

LET'S PUT THE "SIN"
IN WISCONSIN.

ARE YOU GUYS RELATED OR MARRIED,
OR WHAT'S THE STORY?

NO.

YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER?

NOPE.
HOW CAN TWO GUYS BE SO SIMILAR

AND NOT EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER?

[mocking guffaw]

WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SIR?

PAUL.
PAUL.

AND, UH?

LEIF.
"LEAVE"?

LIKE "GET THE [bleep]
OUT OF HERE"?

AND LOOK AT THIS.
HOW YOU DOING, BABY?

COME HERE A SECOND.
OH.

IF YOU HAD TO [bleep]
ONE OF THESE...

ESCAPED PRISON INMATE--

I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THESE ARE.


HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING
THE EXACT SAME HAIR ON YOUR FACE

AS I HAVE ON MY BALLS?

ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
YEP.

I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THIS.
WHAT DO YOUR KNUCKLES SAY?

COME HERE A SECOND.
"THE TRUTH."

WHAT'S THAT?
"THE TRUTH."

THE TRUTH?
THE TRUTH?

YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.
NO, I CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH.

IT'S YOU--I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH

BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS
YOU NEED A [bleep] BATH.

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

YOU GUYS HAVE A GREAT WALK
BACK TO THE WOODS.

THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT?

TELL MOM AND DAD
AND COUSINS ALL I SAID HI.

BEING ON THE ROAD
CAN BE LONELY.

ALL RIGHT,
NOW SHOW YOUR HEINIE.

WHOO!

SO BY THE TIME
I GOT TO VEGAS...

HEY, JEFF!

I WAS READY
TO BANG ANYBODY.

I'D LIKE TO DOUBLE DOWN
ON THOSE RIGHT NOW, WHOO!

I'M ALL-IN.

I LOVE COMING TO VEGAS, MAN.

I WANTED TO STAY
AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK,

BUT IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE,

SO I STAYED
AT NEWARK, NEWARK.

THERE'S A GUY TAKING A SHIT
IN THE LOBBY.

I LIKE WHEN YOU FLY IN,
YOU SEE THE LUXOR.

YOU SEE THAT [bleep]--

THAT BAT-LIGHT
FOR [bleep] HOOKERS GOING.

THE TRAMP LAMP.

YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN VEGAS
WHEN YOU SEE THAT SHIT,

RIGHT, HONEY-TITS?

I WENT TO
THE DAVID COPPERFIELD SHOW.

THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

HE DID HIS BEST TRICK EVER.

HE MADE CRISS ANGEL DISAPPEAR.

WHA-HA! GONE!

I WANT
YOUR SHOES, BITCH!

I WANT
<i>YOUR</i> SHOES, BITCH.

I WANT MY BALLS
IN YOUR MOUTH, BITCH.

IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT
IN VEGAS.

THIS IS A SONG THAT MY DAD
USED TO PLAY FOR ME

RIGHT BEFORE HE USED TO STICK
HIS PINKIE IN MY ASS[bleep].

[playing <i>Dueling Banjos]</i>

THAT'S THE ONLY PART I KNOW.

I USED TO PASS OUT
RIGHT AFTER THAT PART.

â™ª

I REMEMBER THE LYRICS.
THE LYRICS WERE...

"SHH."

I KNOW IT'S MARCH MADNESS.

WE MUST HAVE SOME SPORTS FANS
IN THIS WEEKEND.

I'M MORE OF
A FOOTBALL FAN MYSELF.

I LOVE FOOTBALL.

TOO SOON FOR THE PENN STATE
SEX SCANDAL JOKES?

all: NO!

IN HONOR OF THE RECENT DEATH
OF COACH JOE PATERNO,

I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
TAKE 12 YEARS OF SILENCE.

HEY, I DON'T KNOW IF
I WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY

WHERE A COACH
CAN'T WASH HIS PLAYERS' LEGS

AFTER A WORKOUT.

LET'S NOT FORGET
WHO THE REAL VICTIMS ARE,

THE GUYS WHO WORK AS JANITORS
IN THE PENN STATE LOCKER ROOM.

HEY, I CARE, PEOPLE.

I READ THE [bleep]
TEN-PAGE INDICTMENT.

I [bleep] TWICE.
I HAD TO PUT IT DOWN.

WE LOST TWO GREAT COMEDIANS
FROM THE ROAST WORLD LAST YEAR,

PATRICE O'NEAL
AND GREG GIRALDO.

IF YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS,
SHOW 'EM SOME LOVE.

IF YOU DON'T KNOW 'EM,
LOOK 'EM UP, BUY THEIR STUFF.

IT'S WORTH IT,
I PROMISE.

YOU KNOW,
WHEN COMEDIANS LOSE PEOPLE,

WE FEEL PAIN
MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE.

THAT'S OUR TRADE, PAIN.

IT WAS SO SAD
WHEN MY FAVORITE RAPPER,

RIGHT HERE IN VEGAS,
TUPAC, WAS MURDERED.

I GUESS NOW HIS NAME WOULD MAKE
MORE SENSE BACKWARDS, RIGHT?

CAPUT.

[strumming guitar riff]

â™ª

FOR YEARS,
I THOUGHT TUPAC SHAKUR

WAS A JEWISH HOLIDAY.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR TUPAC SHAKUR?"

"I DON'T KNOW,
IS THAT THE ONE

WHERE YOU DON'T EAT
FOR 24 HOURS?"

"I THINK IT'S THE ONE
WHERE YOU GET SHOT IN THE FACE

IN LAS VEGAS."

"OH, OKAY."

IN HONOR OF MY DAD,
JOE PATERNO, STEVE JOBS,

TUPAC, GREG, AND PATRICE,

ROAST IN PEACE.

â™ª

LOOK AT THESE

[laughs]
RIGHT?

THAT'S MY DAUGHTER, YEAH.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN RELATED?

23 YEARS.
"TWENTY-TWEE" YEARS?

"TWENTY-TWEE," YEAH.
JESUS.

I'M FROM BOSTON.
HE'S FROM BOSTON!

YOUR [bleep] BREATH
SMELLS LIKE HER [bleep],

THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
YEAH, [bleep] RIGHT.

DON'T GET SMART STANDING
WHERE YOU ARE, MOTHER[bleep].

[laughs]
[laughs] OKAY, THERE, UH...

WERE YOU CROSBY,
STILLS, OR NASH?

I NEVER GET--

WOW, MAN,

THANK YOU,
YOU'RE VERY UGLY IN PERSON,

JUST FOR THE RECORD.
THANK YOU.

WOW, AND WHO THE [bleep]

I'M THE ONE
THAT'S BEEN YELLING AT YOU

ALL [bleep] NIGHT.

WOW, WAY TO GO,

WHOO!

HOW DID SHE GET UP HERE
AFTER ALL THAT?

WHAT THE [bleep]
IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?

GIVE ME YOUR SHOE, BABY.
SHH SHH SHH.

WHY IS THIS

SOMEONE--
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

GOOD JOB, JEFFREY.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

YOU GUYS ARE VERY DISGUSTING.
[bleep] YOU.

WOW.

OH, MY GOD.

I HEARD

OH, MY GOD.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

[laughs]

I'LL DO THE JOKES,
GLADYS, OKAY?

WOW, YOU ARE F--

I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

[laughs]

OH, MY GOD, WE GOT
THE WHOLE [bleep] CAST

OF <i>THE GOLDEN GIRLS</i>
HERE TODAY.

DON'T KNOCK IT
TILL YOU'VE TRIED IT.

WHAT'S THAT?

DON'T KNOCK IT
TILL YOU'VE TRIED IT.

I'LL [bleep] TRY THE KNOCKERS
ANY TIME YOU LET ME.

I LIVE IN VEGAS,
AND THESE ARE REAL.

WOW.

I GOTTA JERK OFF
RIGHT NOW.

OH, MY GOD,
YOU ARE THE SEXIEST STRIPPER

I'VE EVER SEEN.

WOW, LOOK AT YOU.

WHO DOES YOUR HAIR,
THE JOKER?

YOU ARE GONNA
GET IT TONIGHT.

WOW, YOU HAVE
THE TITS OF AN ANGEL

AND THE ASS OF A PLUMBER.

BABY JESUS.

LIFE IS SHORT,
MAKE AS MUCH LOVE AS POSSIBLE.

I MEAN,
I READ A CRAZY ARTICLE

IN THE NEW YORK TIMES
SCIENCE SECTION.

SOME OF YOU
MAY HAVE SEEN THIS.

SOME MEDICAL RESEARCHERS
THINK THAT BLOW JOBS

COULD POTENTIALLY
CAUSE CANCER.

DON'T PANIC, LADY.

IT'S NOT PROVEN YET.

SOME DOCTORS THINK
THAT THERE COULD BE A VIRUS

IN THE MAN'S SEMEN THAT,
IF IT GETS IN YOUR THROAT,

COULD CAUSE CANCER.

THEY HAVEN'T PROVED IT YET.
WE'LL KNOW WHEN THAT'S PROVEN

'CAUSE THAT'LL BE
THE BIGGEST STORY IN HISTORY.

OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, BLOW JOBS
CAUSE CANC--WAIT, HOLD ON.


WE FOUND A CURE
FOR BLOW JOB CANCER.

WHEW!

SORRY, BREAST CANCER,

YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
A LITTLE LONGER.

DOCTORS HAD AN EMERGENCY.

I REPEAT, BLOW JOBS
DO NOT CAUSE CANCER.

THAT WOULD BE TOUGH NEWS
TO SWALLOW.

BACK TO YOU, KATIE.

THANKS, BOB.

IN OTHER NEWS,
JEFF ROSS IS IN TOWN.

NO, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M A GOOD LOVER.

I'M GOOD AT THE--
THE BUILD-UP, YOU KNOW?

THE--THE RAMP-UP.
THE PREPRODUCTION.

THE, YOU KNOW,
THE FOREPLAY.

WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE--
[imitates bed squeaking]

I'M GONE IN 60 SECONDS.

I TOLD MY GIRLFRIEND
WE NEED A SYSTEM, YOU KNOW?

KEEP ME FROM HAVING
AN ORGASM SO FAST.

I SAID, "WHAT IF YOU
JUST, LIKE, WHISPER--

"IF WE HAD A CODE WORD
THAT YOU JUST WHISPERED

"THAT WOULD MAKE ME, LIKE,
FLIP THE SWITCH IN MY HEAD

AND NOT--
AND JUST LAST LONGER."

SHE SAYS, "WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT YOUR CODE WORD TO BE?"

AND I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

I JUST THOUGHT OF
THE WORST THING EVER

THAT CAME TO MY MIND.

I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW,
JUST SAY, UH,

JUST SAY 'HOLOCAUST.'"

COUPLE MORNINGS LATER,
WE'RE MAKING LOVE, AND--

NOTHING BETTER
THAN SOME MORNING LOVE,

AND WE'RE HAVING
SOME GRITS AND BAGELS.

AND WE'RE MAKING LOVE,
AND IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL,

AND SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL,
I'M ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

AND SUDDENLY, SHE WHISPERS
IN MY EAR, SHE SAYS,

"I CAN'T BELIEVE THOSE POOR
6 MILLION JEWS WHO DIED

IN THE CONCENTRATION CAMP
AT AUSCHWITZ."

I WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

I DON'T WANT A WIKIPEDIA
PRINTOUT RIGHT NOW."

THEN I [bleep] ON HER TITS
AND KILLED

ANOTHER 6 MILLION JEWS.

TOO SOON?

NEVER TOO SOON.

[bar piano music]

ALL RIGHT, NASHVILLE,
LET'S FINISH THIS UP

WITH A POEM.

[cheers and applause]

YEAH!


THIS IS AWESOME!

THIS IS MEGAN MULLINS,
AN AMAZING, AMAZING MUSICIAN.

JOHN RICH, ONE OF
THE TOP SONGWRITERS IN HISTORY.

I TRIED TO FIND
A COWBOY HAT TO FIT YOU.

[laughs]

I LOOKED ALL DAY.

I FOUND A COUPLE
THAT WOULD FIT YOUR HEAD,

BUT NONE OF 'EM
COVERED UP YOUR FACE,

SO I DECIDED
NOT TO BUY ANY OF 'EM.

WOW, I LOVE THAT.

TODAY, WE WERE
SHOOTING GUNS, AND--

AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT
YOU THOUGHT A 9-MILLIMETER

WAS A BIG GUN.

BUT THEN
IT ALSO OCCURRED TO ME

THAT YOU MEASURE YOUR [bleep]
BY CENTIMETERS.

[laughs]

THANK YOU SO MUCH
