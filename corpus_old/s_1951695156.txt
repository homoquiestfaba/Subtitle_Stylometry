Hey, Kevin.

She loves Kevin Smith, really.

Kevin Smith, he's brilliant.

Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Smith.

That was...

That was a really...
That was a sweet reaction.

That almost, almost makes up
for the fact that, you know...

...Charles is gonna marry Camilla.

Almost.

This is a very intimate room.

When I heard "theater," I was like,
"Right on, theater."

But this is kind of like
Affleck's living room.

Except not as many whores,
I don't think.

We have a few members
of the British press...

...in attendance tonight as well.

So if you see people
writing shit down...

...punch them in the face.

Not really.
Bunch of them went, "Nuts."

The British press I've had, you know,
a decent relationship with.

I haven't really gotten beaten
the shit out of like some people...

...but last time I was here,
I got into a bit of a row, as they say...

...with some fucking chavs
in the British press.

That's the thing,
they weren't even chavs.

If they were chavs,
I could've gotten along with them...

...but they were just
three fucking cunts.

I don't say that in the charming British,
like, "Oh, you fucking cunt."

I say it in the hard-core American,
like, "You dirty fucking cunt!"

These three broads, they call
themselves the 3am Girls...

...they write for the <i>Mirror</i>, is that it?

So you've heard of them.

We were coming over to do
a <i>Jersey Girl</i> premiere...

...and, of course, Affleck,
at the last minute...

Well, not "of course."
We all expected he was going.

But suddenly came down
with bronchitis...

Hence his new nickname,
"Bronchifer."

And had to bow out.

So it was me and the little girl,
Raquel Castro, who's in the movie...

...who wound up doing
all the press...

...which was, you know, weird,
because nobody knows her...

...and what do you ask
an 8-year-old anyway?

Like, "What do you wanna be
when you grow up?"

Because the kid's like,
"Fuck you, I'm it. I'm acting."

And then me,
who wasn't really in the movie.

Basically, I was the guy who was just
making excuses for the movie...

...apparently, most of the time.

So it was kind of
a lackluster premiere...

...and it was heralded
in the 3am Girls' column by...

You know, I never forget anything,
so I bring shit.

I have an elephant...
Elephantine-like memory.

And ass.

So this is...
This is what they said initially:

"Surprise, surprise,
Ben Affleck has pulled out...

...of the U.K. Premiere
of movie turkey...

<i>... Jersey Girl,</i> in which he starred
alongside ex-fiancée, Jennifer Lopez.

The star was due to attend tonight's
screening with director Kevin Smith...

...and young actress Raquel Castro...

...but the 31 -year-old is staying away
because he has, ahem, bronchitis."

That "ahem" is just like...
Just dig it in, you know?

So anyway, this is the part that really
stood out to me. It's a quote:

"'It's a shame Ben has pulled out...

...because it's obvious this film
needs all the publicity it can get'...

...says an insider."

Now, A, we didn't want publicity
on the movie.

We had too much of it.
Sadly, all bad.

But the thing that really bugged me,
who the fuck is the insider?

Like a British insider?
Like, who was it?

As far as I know, there were no Brits
in the cast or the crew.

And I checked.

Because I said "cunt" an awful lot.

If you say it here, people are like,
"Right on, mate," you know.

You say it back home, they're like,
"Oh, cunt?"

As if people don't like it.

As if we were in Toronto.

So the quote... Or the insider
went on to say:

"It's unusual for none of the big stars
to put in an appearance...

...and it says a lot about
what they think of the movie."

What? So who is this
fucking random person...

...and why do they have
so much to say, and why...?

Is their finger really
on the pulse and shit?

Like they know so much
about Hollywood.

So we're at the premiere that night,
and this chick, Caroline Hedley...

...who is one of the 3am Girls.
Hedley. You know, right there.

Most people are named, you know,
back in the day for what they did.

I'm Smith, presumably somewhere
in my line I had a blacksmith.

Hedley?

That says cocksucker to me.

So...

So I'm meeting
with Caroline Hedley...

...and of course I fucking
remembered her name...

...and her atrocious-looking
face from the byline.

So I said, "Hey, what's up?
Who's the insider?

Why are you trashing
the movie without giving it a shot?

Why do you have to write like that?

Why does it always have to be
negative? Can't it be positive?

Little girl's here, first time in England,
she's in the movie, and why...?"

And she's like:

"You know what, you're right.
You're turning me around here."

And I was like, "I am?"

And I said, "Right on." So I started
giving her a pretty decent interview.

Then she wrote this:

"It's obvious to everyone else
that Ben Affleck and J. Lo...

...do not a good movie make.

But at least the director of their latest
flick has the grace to admit as much.

The pair dubbed 'Bennifer'
made <i>Jersey Girl</i>...

...before their rather acrimonious split
earlier this year."

Now, this is my quote.
This is the guy saying...

This is the director having
"the grace to admit as much."

"'I think from now on I'm gonna have a
no-couples rule in my movie,' he said."

That's me.

"The negative vibe surrounding them
has definitely taken away...

...some of the business
we could have done."

Is that really me admitting to anything,
or going like, "I'm so fucking sorry.

This is the worst thing that's happened
to humanity since the Holocaust...

...and I don't know what I was thinking.
Please, mea culpa, mea culpa"?

No, not at all.

But this is the really weird thing.

She refers to me as "the movie's fat,
bearded, hobbit-look-alike...

...director, Kevin Smith."

Now, I'll take fat and bearded...

...and you can throw in sweaty...

...but hobbit-like?

Like, if I'm a hobbit,
this bitch is an Orc.

But the thing that really
bitched me out the most...

...the thing I really couldn't stand,
was the insider thing...

...because it's just so vague, right?

You could make shit up and be like,
"Insider told me. Total insider."

And I think, in this case, it meant
some dude was fucking inside her.

But two can play at that game...

...because I did some investigating
of my own...

...and insiders tell me...

...vis-à-vis, regarding
the 3am Girls...

...that for a euro...

...not a pound, mind you,
a fucking euro...

...you could take any one
of the 3am Girls...

...and brick in her fucking mouth.

Now, mind you,
I don't know if that's true.

It's just what some insiders told me.

Seemed credible.

But these British press people
aren't like that...

...so don't punch them
in the fucking face.

I changed my mind...

...in the middle of that story.

All right, so enough about
fucking me.

Let's go over to you guys...

...and then come back to me.

Who's got the mike first?
This side of the room. You got it?

You got the mike?

Yeah, it's a real hand-raising...

And don't, you know...
Jut right the fuck...

Be American about it.
Like, "Hey, I demand things!

It is my right, according to our
Constitution that we piss all over."

First question of the night, sir.

Set the tone.
Okay.

First of all, on behalf of everyone here,
thanks a lot for coming to England.

It's great to have you here.
Thank you, very grateful to be here.

Thank you.

Thank you.

My question is regarding your
fictional cartoon characters...

...Bluntman and Chronic.
Yes.

Is there a chance that we might see
a <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i> movie?

And also, if you don't make one...

...is there a particular
Marvel or DC comic character...

...that you'd like to make
a movie about...

...seeing as you've already
starred in <i>Daredevil.</i>

So basically, in England
there's a 46-part question?

It's never as simple as, like,
"Who would you fuck?"

I'm like, "Well..."

Let's take it piece by piece.

I've gotta wait for you to get around
the room, so I've gotta get it all in now.

Right, right. Cram it all in there.
Exactly.

I understand. I grew up fat.

So I always understand the feeling
of, like, "This might be my last meal."

That's why that's...
You feel my pain, thank you.

You got...? Oh, really?
All right, let me see what your gut.

You don't look that fat.

You're sitting next to a chick?
Do you know him? No?

You will by the end of the night.

I'm gonna romance you two.

For each other.

Oh, you're with him?
Fuck that guy.

Why...? He seems rather fit.
Go for the heavy guy.

Heavy guys are awesome lovers.

Once you get past the grotesque
swinging gut.

Heavy guys try harder...

...because they've got
a lot to make up for.

And they're so fucking
slobberingly grateful...

...for even the tiniest piece
of pussy they're thrown...

...you will be eaten out like
you've never been eaten out before.

You'll be eaten out like a man
coming off a desert island...

...digging into a chicken.

I mean, you do have the skills
to back this up, right?

I would hate to go this distance
and have you be like:

"Sorry, I like cock, you know."

So <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i>.

Are we ever gonna make a <i>Bluntman</i>
<i>and Chronic</i> movie? Came close.

And that's what eventually became
<i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i>.

Like, I had initially thought:

"Hey, maybe a whole movie
about <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i>."

I forget who I ran it past.

I think I ran it past Mewes,
and I was like:

"What about us as superheroes
the whole movie?"

He was like,
"You really wanna do that?"

I was like, "Wouldn't it be cool?

We can do, like,
a fake comic-book movie."

He's like, "You're gonna wear tights?"

I was like, "You're right,
maybe just a scene."

Because we don't need that.

So, no, probably no
<i>Bluntman and Chronic</i> feature.

Maybe in the comic-book form.

Maybe I'll get around to doing another
<i>Bluntman and Chronic</i> comic...

...but I can't see myself doing
a whole... A whole feature about it.

And what about the sort of
<i>X- Men</i>- type character angle?

Would you ever think about doing like
a <i>Batman</i>- or <i>Superman</i>- type movie?

Or a <i>Fantastic Four</i>?

Do a big comic-book movie?
Yeah.

At one point I was attached, and
still am kind of, to <i>The Green Hornet.</i>

I was gonna... I was doing <i>Superman</i>
at one point a long time ago.

But... And we won't talk
about that anymore.

But I was attached
to do <i>Green Hornet...</i>

...up till recently
when I decided to not direct it.

I wrote it. I turned in a first draft,
turned in a second draft...

...but I don't wanna direct it,
because for me...

...I don't have the patience
to do a movie like that.

Like, Harvey Weinstein,
the chairman of Miramax is like:

"You wanna do
the <i>Green Hornet</i> movie?"

And I was like,
"You wanna give me...?

You wanna give me
a comic-book movie?

I love comic books."

He's like, "That's why I asked you."

Said, "I would fucking love to do it."

It was one of those things
that you're so happy to get...

...that you don't think about it
until, you know...

...the smoke is fucking cleared
and it's announced and shit like that...

...that you have no interest
in doing it whatsoever.

Like, I love watching
comic-book movies, but making one?

Fucking boring.

Like, the few times I've actually
had to shoot an action sequence...

...what passed for an action sequence
in some of the flicks we've done...

...it's always so tedious
and fucking slow...

...and it's just, like, you grab
this little piece here...

...then you shoot that fucking
until it's right...

...then you grab this little piece here.
It's a series of cuts.

Whereas, shooting dialogue,
it's just people shooting the shit...

...and they're saying the dialogue
you wrote...

...and I'm kind of in love
with my own shit, so it's just fun.

I'm like, "That's great, let's do it again."
Like, "It wasn't good enough?"

I'm like, "It was great,
I just wanna hear it again."

Action sequences
take like a day to shoot...

...and at the end of the day,
when you cut it together...

...it's like maybe 10 seconds
of screen time.

So that kind of shit's boring to me.

Also, I just don't have it in me to be
a real, like, visual, visceral director.

Like, I'm not the guy...
My version of the <i>Green Hornet...</i>

...would be, like,
the Green Hornet and Kato...

...leaning against the Black Beauty...

...the amazing super car
that can do anything...

...and talking about,
you know, pussy.

I mean, it's that simple.

And then Kato would just be like:

"Hey, is that a crime happening
over there?"

Pointing off camera.

And we wouldn't even pan to it.

And Green Hornet would be like,
"Yeah, you're right.

We should do something about it.
Let's roll, Kato."

And then they step out
of the frame...

...and we hold on the car,
and we just hear shit...

...ass kicking,
and then the two come back...

...and they're just like:

"So where was I?

Oh, totally, dude.

Anal sex has nothing to do..."
You know, and just go on from there.

And nobody wants
to make that movie.

Like, if I could get away with making
that version of the movie...

...like, the least visually interesting
comic-book movie of all time...

...that's essentially like
one of my chick...

One of my flicks, but just putting
motherfuckers in masks, I'd do it.

But nobody will finance that.

And the thing is,
once you take a budget...

Like, the budget in <i>Green Hornet</i> is
gonna be like 50, 70, 80 million bucks.

Once you take a budget...

...you have to start listening
to what other people say.

It's no longer your flick.

<i>Green Hornet</i> would never be
my movie.

It would always be like this movie
that was kind of noted to death...

...because, wisely, the people
who invest the money in it...

...which would be Miramax or whatever
the new company Miramax becomes...

...or Harvey and Bob
become when they leave Miramax...

...they would wanna make
back their investment.

You don't make your money back
doing my version of the movie.

So essentially they'd be like:

"An action beat has got to happen
every 10 pages."

You've got to follow a formula.

Like, you'd hear a lot of like,
"Do it like <i>Spider-Man.</i>"

Something like... What,
he should shoot fucking webs...

...and act really stiffly?

I was gonna say,
if you were to make it...

...would you put Affleck
in the leading role?

I would totally cast Affleck.

Totally, totally.
I would cast that dude in anything.

Anything whatsoever.
Yeah, <i>Green Hornet.</i>

I'd cast him
as Green Hornet and Kato.

Just have him doing
a really insulting Asian accent.

Do split screen.
Have him talk to himself.

"Kato, do you like pussy?"
"Oh, me love pussy."

Just where critics were like,
"We don't even know what to say.

He's fucking lost his mind.

Yeah, it's funny,
but he lost his mind, you know?"

So, no, you've got to give movies
like that to people like Bryan Singer.

Like, you know, I love...
He did the <i>X- Men</i>, he did <i>X- Men 2</i>.

And I love those movies.
He's doing <i>Superman</i> now.

And I love fucking <i>X- Men 2.</i>

I thought that was an insanely
well-made comic-book movie...

...and balanced a lot of story lines
and shit like that.

And just it works so well
because it's just one big, gay parable.

You know, essentially <i>X- Men</i>
is about being gay...

...and how weird it is to live in a world
surrounded by people who are like:

"You're gay."

So it's totally entertaining.

But meanwhile, you know,
most people don't view it like that.

Most people view it, you know,
the way it's presented...

...where fucking Toad is getting
the shit beat out of him by Cyclops...

...or some such shit.

Or Wolverine is taking on fucking...

Colonel Stryker's attacking...
The team attacking the mansion.

But me, I'm sitting there going,
"This is all about being gay."

So you come out of the theater...

...and little kids are like,
"I love Wolverine."

And you're like,
"Come here, come here.

You like Wolverine, dude?

Because if you like Wolverine...

...it's pretty much saying
that you'd put a cock in your mouth.

Let me explain shit to you about
what a gay parable this movie is."

Then you drop science on, you know,
a little 10-year-old for 20 minutes...

...and then, by the end, you send him
off into the world ready to eat cock.

Because that's what
the <i>X- Men</i> movie is.

It's just preparing a whole
next generation of kids to be like:

"Hey, it's all right to be gay.

I'm down with it. Wolverine's gay.

That fat guy told me he is."

So I'm kind of hoping Bryan Singer
takes, like, <i>Superman</i>...

...and just turns that
into a gay parable as well.

Just make it all about
how Superman's gay...

...and Lois is like, "Oh, Superman!"
And he's like, "Whatever.

Hey, Jimmy...

...I see you have a camera."

So, I don't... Give it to those cats.

Those cats know
how to make movies like that.

I don't know
how to make movies like that...

...and I'm really not that interested.

Like, as soon as the smoke cleared
from <i>Green Hornet</i>...

...and the fallout of <i>Jersey Girl,</i>
I was just like:

"You know what, fuck,
I'd rather make a small movie."

I'd rather make something cheap.
And that's eventually...

Then we were working on the <i>Clerks X</i>
DVD, the 10th anniversary DVD.

And I was like,
"This is what I'd rather do.

I'd rather go back and see
what these dudes are about."

It's like making <i>The Green Hornet,</i>
just taking off the mask.

Well, my version of <i>The Green Hornet.</i>
But just taking off the mask.

So that's where I switch
and was just like:

"This is what I'd rather...
This is what I'm made to do."

Like, "This is what I like to do,
shit like this."

I love to watch
comic-book movies...

...just don't wanna make them.
Too lazy.

Way too lazy.

Because they just require
too much effort and shit like that.

I'm the guy who, like...
I don't even fuck on top, sir.

Like, I'm a bottom guy...

...because being on top
takes too much energy.

Like, well, how can I direct
a superhero movie...

...if I won't even have... Give my wife
the courtesy of climbing aboard.

Where I'm just like, "Go."

Maybe you're looking to be
the antihero in that?

In my relationship with my wife?

Like I'm the villain and shit?

I hadn't thought about it like that.

I guess so.

My idea of being Lex Luthor is like,
"No, you fuck me."

"Don't you want
to take over the world?"

"No. I just don't want to
do the fucking...

...because I get sweaty,
and then the gut swings.

Just, you jump onboard
and tell me when you're done...

...and then I'll wrap up,
and we'll watch some TV."

So no <i>Bluntman and Chronic</i>.

Thanks a lot.
Right on.

Upstairs.
Hello.

Hello. Where are you?
I'm actually up here. You missed me.

Hello.
One, I think you're great.

I love all your movies
and your comics.

Thank you. "Comics."
Your comics.

So cute. "Comics."

"Never read one because I'm a girl."
That is not true!

You read comics?
I've got loads.

You're a comic-reading chick?
Yes.

Right on. Hard-core.
Got over 300.

You must be fucking swamped
in a comic-book store.

I used to work at Forbidden Planet,
so I've got loads of access.

Did you really? You worked there?
Yeah.

You know half those dudes
came in...

...they didn't even give a shit
about comics, they were just like:

"She's got boobies."

Big ones, I know.

"She's one of those,
what do you call them?

What do you call them, Gordon?

Ladies. Yes.

She's one of them ladies.

Hello, love."
My accent... My accent's not that bad.

It's not that bad?

I've got a comic-book store.
I know what I'm talking about.

Same shit, they just don't have
the cute accent.

I'll come work in your shop, then.

Yeah. Oh, please do.

We'd triple business.

We'd triple foot traffic.

I don't know if anybody would buy
anything unless you were like:

"Who wants to buy this,
I rubbed it on me bum."

Then you'd see motherfuckers
trample one another to get a book...

...that touched a lady's bum.

I hope you got a question.

My question is, though,
you listed <i>Shaun of the Dead...</i>

...as one of your top-10-favorite
films of last year...

I loved <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>.

Would you consider
working with them?

That's so easy, man.
You just come to the fucking...

Do the hometown favorites.

You're like, "I love
<i>Shaun of the Dead</i>," they're like:

"So did we. We're fucking British."

I love <i>The Office</i>.
"He's a smart one, he is."

I don't like <i>The Office.</i>

You don't like <i>The Office</i>?
No.

Get out.

You didn't like <i>The Office</i>?

No.
<i>Office</i> is brilliant.

It takes all sorts.
That job I offered you? Forget it.

It does take all sorts.
So anyway, your question was?

Would you consider
working with them?

Would I consider working with the
bunch that did <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>?

I mean, yeah, if they were like,
"Hey, you wanna be in our movie?

Try to ruin it like you ruin all yours?"

I just can't imagine they would...
They don't need help, man.

Those dudes are doing great.

I never saw <i>Spaced,</i>
is that what it's called?

Yeah. It's really scary.
Until I was flying over...

...and watched
an episode on the plane.

Fucking brilliant. It's really, really cool.
So I'm gonna grab like...

I guess the first three seasons
are out here?

There's only two.
There's only two?

Yeah, we've been bugging them for the
third season for quite a long time now.

When you say "we," you mean?
The British public.

Me and my bloke.

We go to the network,
we're like where's three, eh?

It's like the first question that's always
asked, like, "What's a Nubian?"

"When's season three coming out?"
"Oh, for fuck's sake."

They get that question a lot,
do they?

And then they're like, "Wait a second,
you're one of them ladies."

Yeah, so I like that.

I thought that was really funny
and kind of very much in the...

Looked and felt like
<i>Shaun of the Dead</i>.

So now I wanna see all that.

I love those dudes, but I don't think
they'd need any help.

Seem to have their own crew going.
Call them.

Next time they work an event,
I'll tell them to call you.

Right on. I think I'm gonna see them.
I think... I'm doing the Empire Awards.

I'm getting an Empire Award.

<i>Empire</i> magazine has an awards
thing they do every year...

...and they're giving me an award.

And I think those dudes are gonna
be there, so I'm gonna hit them up.

Be like, "Can I be in one
of your movies?"

They're like, "I think the fat <i>Clerks</i> guy
wants to be in one of our shows.

No."

Thank you very much.
"J. Lo lover."

Thank you.
Thank you.

Down here. Yes, sir?

Yeah, a while ago
you did the commentary...

...the director's-cut commentary,
with Richard Kelly.

I did the <i>Donnie Darko</i>
commentary, yes.

Just, basically, I wanted to know,
A, how that came about...

...and, B, there was a kind of
phrase that you said...

...where you kind of said to Richard:

"Now you've done <i>Donnie Darko</i>...

...people are wanting you to remake
this film, like, over and over."

And you said that's basically
how you felt with <i>Clerks</i>.

I was just gonna ask,
with hindsight...

...would you actually consider
going back...

...and maybe have done
<i>Jersey Girl</i> earlier...

...or maybe have done something
without Jay and Bob?

Would I...?

Well, I don't think now,
having done <i>Jersey Girl...</i>

...I don't think I'd ever make another
movie without Jay and Silent Bob.

Because people are like,
"Are they in it? No? Fuck it.

Fuck it."

But, no, I don't think I'd ever do...

I'd have ever done anything
differently, looking back.

I really kind of like
the way the dominoes fell.

You know, and it sucked that
<i>Jersey Girl</i> didn't do more business...

...but, like, whatever, it doesn't
make me go and wanna go back...

...and to catch the fucking DeLorean,
jump back in time...

...and nearly have sex
with my mother.

For the record, I took my brother
to see <i>Jersey Girl.</i>

He said it was your <i>Annie Hall</i>, which
I think is a really big compliment.

And he said what?
He said it was your <i>Annie Hall</i>.

My <i>Annie Hall</i>? I thought he was like,
"It was your only hole."

What is that?
British slang for, like, "good job"?

It's your only hole, mate.

You're only fucking hole...

...you fucking cunt.

<i>Annie Hall</i>?
He called it my <i>Annie Hall</i>?

That's very sweet.

I basically mumble...

...because some fat guy told me
about Wolverine was gay, you see.

So you're gay?

Not really.
No?

Lot more options when you're gay.

Shit's opened up.
I was at a comic-book show and...

Pun intended.

I was at a comic-book show in
San Francisco about two weeks ago...

...the WonderCom...

...and at the same time,
across the street...

...they were having this big bear
convention about the bear movement.

Like where big dudes who look
like me, and, if I may, like you...

...who are kind of, you know,
hairy and large...

...are referred to in
the gay community as "bears."

There apparently are a bunch of dudes
who like dudes who look like us.

Those dudes are called cubs.

Or twinks.

But I like "cubs." That's cute.

So apparently, like, these dudes
make out like...

Like my friend Malcolm Ingram.
Big, big burly dude.

I don't know,
you might've seen him in stuff.

He directed <i>Drawing Flies,</i> and he's
been around some of our stuff.

Great guy. Big Canadian idiot.

But one day he was just like...
He called me up...

And he never represented himself
as being anything but into chicks.

Then one day he called me up like,
"Fucking weirdest thing happened."

I was like, "What is it?"
He said, "I went out with some dude.

Went out to dinner, and turned out
it was a fucking date."

And I was like, "What?"
And he was just like:

"I just thought I was going out
to dinner with a fucking dude...

...and it was the fucking date load.
All of a sudden, we were on a date.

He told me he was gay
and we were on a date, eh?"

I was like, "Well, did you then accept
the fact that you were on a date or...?"

He was like,
"Well, you know, he was paying."

So that was Malcolm's...

Years later, I realized that was
Malcolm's charming way of saying:

"Hey, I'm gay," without just saying,
"Hey, I'm gay."

He acted like he got fucking
hornswoggled into being gay.

"Some dude bought me a pizza,
and all of a sudden I'm gay. Go figure.

Well, I guess that's what I am,
you know."

So Malcolm told me, Malcolm's like:

"Dude, fucking A,
if you liked guys...

...you'd be huge
in the bear community...

...because, you know,
you fucking make movies...

...and you're very sexy to cubs."

And I was like, "What?"

And he was like, "Truly.

You wanna see?
This is a picture of my boyfriend."

And Malcolm whipped out
a picture of his boyfriend...

...and I would fuck this dude.

Like this dude's real, like,
Joe-college cute and shit like that.

Like real good-looking dude.

And the fact that he wants to fuck
Malcolm is like...

I wanna get the kid some therapy.
Some help.

Because I got no problem
with being gay...

...but, like, being gay
and wanting to fuck Malcolm?

You're like, "I'm choosing a life
of nothing but fucking ridicule...

...and people fucking
getting on my ass...

...and I can't fucking do what
straights fucking do...

...without hearing it from
the fucking Church...

...and I'm gonna fuck the fat
bearded guy too," you know?

Like just make it
a little harder on himself.

So Malcolm's like,
"I'm telling you, man...

...if this straight thing don't work
out for you...

...you can totally fucking fuck
a lot of guys."

And I was like, "All right, man,
that's good to know."

Because it would just kind of
open up a world of options.

He's like, "You go to a fucking
bear bar, you'd be Marilyn Monroe."

And that's when
I started thinking about it.

Because I always kind of wanted
to be like Marilyn Monroe.

That didn't pan out for me.

So I'm like, "Essentially these dudes
are like chubby chasers?"

He's like, "Yeah, you know,
you don't have to be mean about it."

And I was like, "Well, I married
a chubby chaser, apparently."

He's like, "Well, but, you know,
she don't have a dick."

And that's when we moved
onto another topic.

So, yeah, bears, dude. If you ever
think about... Fucking, you'd make out.

Apparently.
Yeah.

You like chicks, though?

Yeah. I haven't found one
in about 10 years though, so...

Time to try the guys.
I know.

What was your question, though?

I mean, basically, the whole
<i>Donnie Darko</i> thing was...

...because apparently you're
in <i>Southland Tales</i>?

I'm in Richard's movie
<i>Southland Tales.</i>

He cast me in it.
I don't know if I'm in it yet.

We haven't shot yet.
It's just kind of the whole kind of...

...second movie thing.

I mean, if you could
go back in time...

...would you do <i>Mallrats</i> with Miramax
rather than Universal?

Yeah, basically,
if I could go back in time...

...and narrowly avoid sleeping
with my mother like Marty McFly...

...I wouldn't have made the movie...

I wouldn't have made <i>Mallrats</i>
at Universal.

I would have waited another year
and then made it at Dimension.

Because at that point
Dimension existed...

...as this kind of genre
offshoot of Miramax...

...but they didn't do comedy,
they only did shit like <i>The Crow.</i>

So a year later they started doing
genre comedy as well.

So we could totally fit right in there.

Which is where we wound up doing
<i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.</i>

That was about it.

That would be the only thing
I would kind of think about changing.

But I don't really have any regrets
regarding doing <i>Mallrats</i> at Universal.

I mean, I did on opening weekend,
when the movie did, like, no business.

But then the movie
found its audience.

It was kind of this wonderful
organic discovery of its audience.

And the audience discovered it,
and suddenly it felt like:

"That's the way it
was supposed to happen."

I just wish somebody told me when I
had the fucking shotgun in my mouth.

The day after the movie opened,
you know, where I was just like:

"Oh, it's over."

But I didn't have any bullets.

So I don't think
I would have changed that.

<i>Southland Tales</i> is a movie
Richard Kelly is doing.

For those of you who don't know
Richard Kelly...

...he's the guy
who directed <i>Donnie Darko.</i>

And he was like,
"Hey, you wanna be in this flick?"

And I was like, "Right on."

Because you ask me to be in a movie,
I'm like, "Okay."

Because I'm kind of a whore
for that thing, that kind of shit.

So I said, "What do I do?"

And he was just like,
"You're a guy who...

You're kind of like
a Harry Knowles kind of guy.

You run an internet site.

It's not really a movie,
it's called <i>Southland Tales</i>.

You traffic in Southland section
of Los Angeles gossip.

Kind of like a Drudge.
And I was like, "Right on."

So, you know, I read it.
Brilliant script.

I was like, "I'm totally in."

A month ago, he wrote me an e-mail,
he's going:

"I'm doing a redraft of your character,
and you're still the guy who you are...

...but now you're an Iraqi war vet
and you have no legs."

So I was like, "Like Lieutenant Dan?"

He said, "Kind of like that."

He's going, "Also, I was wondering...

...and I hope you don't take
this too personally...

...but I was wondering if... Do you think
you could lose 50 pounds to do it?"

And I was like, "If you chop off
my legs, I will lose 50 pounds."

I said, "Other than that,
unless you've got, you know...

...like gastric bypass
in your budget...

...that's really not gonna happen,
Richard."

He's like, "Right, right.
What about shaving your head?"

And I was like, "No.
That shit's going thin already.

Like, I'm not gonna speed
the plow on that one. Fuck it."

He was like, "All right. But you will
pretend you have no legs?"

I was like, "Yeah, that's easy."

He's like, "Right on." Click.

Because he's just, you know...

He's the most normal guy
you'll sit there and talk to.

He's a dude from Virginia and shit.
Real straight-laced. Good guy.

Talk movies and shit.

But, like, then you see
<i>Donnie Darko</i>...

...and the credits roll, and you're like,
"What the fuck happened?

What happened in that movie?"

And I ask him,
and he still can't fucking explain it.

<i>Southland Tales</i>, you can understand.
It kind of... Like, it makes sense.

But <i>Donnie Darko</i>, still to this day,
is fucking mystifying.

And he... I don't even think
he knows what the fuck it means.

I think he just shot a bunch of shit,
threw it in the air...

...taped it back together
and said, "Here it is."

And people were like, "It's brilliant!"
Especially here. They loved it here.

You guys ate it up
like fucking candy over here.

In the States, people are like:

But here they were like, "<i>Darko</i>.

<i>Darko</i>'s our religion," you know.

Richard is very, very happy with
the reception of the movie here.

I told him I was coming over here...

...and he was like,
"They love my movie there, dude."

I was like, "I'll be sure
to drop your name."

He's like, "But don't tell them the role
I want you to play in <i>Southland Tales.</i>"

I said, "I won't."

We good?
Thanks very much.

Thank you, sir.

Thank you, sir.

Yes?
In <i>Jersey Girl</i>...

...one of the funniest bits, I found,
was the whole Will Smith story line.

Yes.

I just wondered how you managed
to get him in the film.

Did he had to have
a special contract...

...where he was contractually
obligated not to do any of his raps?

That's one very long question...

...that just builds up to you
fucking slamming Will Smith.

You don't even
wanna know anything.

You're just like,
"I'm going to ask a question...

...and totally make fun
of Will Smith.

The floor is mine."

I think he's great,
but the raps are a bit dodgy.

They're dodgy, are they?

You don't go for, like,
"Get Jiggy Wit lt?"

It's a shame. I'll let him know.

You are a white girl, though.

I don't know if he really
writes for you.

How did we get him?

It was, basically...
There was a contract involved.

It was a contract
he had to sign that said...

...this would be the lowest-grossing
movie he's ever been in.

Because that movie...
Like, he opens in movies...

...and just fucking... they fucking
explode and shit.

We were probably the lowest-grossing
movie that dude's done in 10 years.

Like, I'm sure he looks at
his track record, he's like:

"Hundred million, 100 million, 100...
What the fuck's that?

It goes off the chart."

"That's <i>Jersey Girl.</i>"

"Fucking fat guy.

Ruined my edge."

How did we do it? We got him
through Ben and Jen, really.

Because I sent him the scene
and shit, and sent him a letter...

Originally, it was written
for Bruce Willis...

...because it was set in '86,
and it was around that period...

...where Bruce Willis thought
he was a singer for a little while.

I don't know if you all remember that?
When he was Bruno...

...and he released an album
as Bruno?

When you pick up the album, you're
like, "That looks like Bruce Willis."

And people would be like:

"It is."

He did. He released two albums
as fucking Bruno and shit.

As if we wouldn't notice
that it was Bruce Willis.

And he'd go on stage,
and people would be like:

"You gotta call him Bruno."

I thought that was so funny.

So I wrote about that.
Like, basically he ran into...

Basically, the thing
that Ollie got fired for...

...for was for essentially being:

"It's fucking Bruce Willis.
It's not Bruno."

And then later on he met him
years later and shit like that.

And we sent it to Bruce Willis,
and Bruno, just to be safe.

I never heard back from him.

Ben was just like,
"I'll fucking handle this, dude.

We were in the fucking
space-rock movie together.

Running from the space rock
and shit.

He'll fucking answer me back
because I was like, 'Harry, I love you."'

And Harry didn't
answer him back and shit.

Harry's like, "I don't love you back,"
you know.

So we never got a response,
so I rewrote it.

I was thinking,
"All right, that leaves us out of '86.

We can update it.

And who is, you know,
if I count back Gertie's age...

...who would be the pop-culture figure
who was, like, big now...

...who wasn't that big then."
And I was like, "Oh, shit, Will Smith."

So I wrote it for Will Smith...

...and then we got it to him,
and he was like:

"You know, I kind of...
It's funny, and I'd kind of like to do it...

...but I think if I play myself
people might think I'm arrogant."

Because he's such a sweet guy,
and so, like, unassuming...

...and one of the best people
in the business.

Real sweetheart of a fucking dude.

So I was like, "You've gotta talk to him,
dude," you know, to Ben.

I was like, "Talk to him. Talk that
famous-person talk to him and shit.

Start talking, like, in the millions...

...and whatever you guys
make and shit.

Bentleys, Hummers,
throw those words around.

You know, and maybe
he'll say yeah."

So Ben talked to him and shit,
and Ben was just like:

"Look, man, like, don't worry.
Like, he's easy to work with and shit.

And you'll come off great.

Trust me, like, you playing yourself,
you come off way better...

...than when I played myself
in this motherfucker's last movie.

So do it."

So basically, those... Ben...
And then also Jen talked to him...

...because they were gonna do
a movie together at one point...

...Will and Jen, this remake
of <i>A Star Is Born</i> or something.

So she knew him through that.
So they both basically asked him...

...and spoke to him
and made him feel at ease.

And he was like,
"All right, I'll do it."

Showed up, greatest fucking...
The sweetest dude in the world.

No entourage and shit. Nice dude.

And it was weird, like,
rehearsing with him...

...because you're, like...
He'd do the lines, I'm like:

"You wouldn't say it like that."

He's like, "Well, the hell I wouldn't.
It's me, ain't it?" You know.

I'm like, "All right, you're right.

Get jiggy with it," you know?

What's the big chav community
out here?

What's the big chav community
out here?

Not in this room. Anyone...?

Is anyone really...? What is indicative
or representative of a chav here?

Burberry?

Burberry?
Is that a town, or the scarf?

It's a scarf? So if you wear
a Burberry scarf you're a chav?

So my wife is a chav?

Trousers tucked into socks?

A chav will take your wallet?

Good to know.
I know a few chavs.

I brought one with me.

Are you back there, chav?

This shit's always
pretty well planned.

Is there a chav buried
back there anywhere?

Is there one? Ladies and gentlemen,
my chav, Jason Mewes.

What's a chav again?

They love me.

It's amazing.

Why don't you field
some questions, sir?

I'm here. I'm ready.
I have a story to tell, though.

Yeah?
About your toilets.

Yes.

I think I'm gonna bring
the toilets that you have out here...

...because it's really deep
and there's hardly any water in it.

So I feel bad for the women
who have to clean the shit...

...that, like, slides on the side.

But I was shitting
before I came out here.

I know you was wanting to know that.

But I went to give myself
a courtesy flush...

...and the water comes
from the front...

...and it fucking splashed
all over my balls.

I had to tell that story.
I was thinking, I'm...

So I think I'm gonna bring it home,
and I'm gonna put it next to my bidet...

...and I'm gonna be able
to clean my ass and my balls...

...before I get my dick sucked.

Isn't that right?
It's a really good thing.

But anyway, I thought
it was pretty amusing.

My balls are clean now, so if anyone
wants to suck my dick?

Ladies, that's an open invitation.
No? No takers.

Or fellas.

And it'll never get more
appealing than that.

A dude who's balls
have been washed by toilet water.

It's gross, though, what...

Like, the women
have to clean that shit, you know?

When the water rushed at your balls,
did it mix with the shit water?

No, because it shoots out the front.

It shoots out the front, and it's so deep
that the shit's way down anyway.

But it's, like, there's no water
for the shit to, like, go in...

...so it just slides down the side
of the fucking...

It's pretty gross, so... You just have
to deal with it all the time, I guess.

We were on our way here today,
and the...

Oh, no.
Yes, sir.

The cutest thing happened.
We get off...

When you travel international
and shit...

...you gotta fill out a card,
the disembark...

Embarkation card? Disembarking...?
The fucking card you gotta fill out...

...any time you go someplace,
like a different country.

And, you know, they ask for your name
and ask for your passport number...

...and then they ask
for your nationality.

And, you know, we're American,
so I wrote "American."

Then I looked at Jason's card...

...and under nationality
he wrote "Polish."

I learned something new today.
You did.

I was like, "What, dude? What?"

He was like, "Well, you know,
I've got some Polish in me."

I was like, "That's not
what they're asking there.

They're asking the country
of your birth, sir."

I really didn't know.
No.

I think they thought it was a joke, like
I wrote it as a joke, but, no, I didn't.

We thought the dude was gonna
be like, "So you're from Poland, then?"

"No."

"Well, that's funny, because it
says here that you're Polish.

Which isn't really a nationality."

The guy just let me through
because I was laughing so hard.

He was like, "Go."

We were in line laughing, and
the dude was like, "What's so funny?"

And I was like,
"My friend's a fucking idiot."

"Welcome to the U.K."

Yes, sir.

If you could be half man,
half sausage...

...which way around
would you have it and why?

One more time. If I could be
half man and half sausage...?

Which way around would you have it
and why?

Well, that's the part that...

Right, so you could have, like,
top half man, bottom half sausage.

Okay, so which end would
I rather be the man?

Or top half sausage, bottom half man,
so you can run around. Classic.

Which side...? Which side do I want
to be the sausage side?

Oh, yeah.

That is hands down the best question
I've ever been asked.

I would choose
bottom-half sausage...

...because then I would finally have
a massive dick.

Top half, not real good.
Genius.

That's brilliant.

Is it a good enough answer?

Not nearly as brilliant
as the question, though.

I've seen you cameo on shows
and movies and stuff.

Do you just...? People call you up
that admire your work...

...and ask you to be
on these shows...

...or do you have like an agent?
Do you actively try and get work?

The only... There were two shows
that I actually pursued.

Or I didn't... It wasn't hardly...
It was hardly a pursuit.

It was me going, "Can I do this?"

And somebody was like,
"Yeah, I guess."

And one was <i>Law & Order</i>.
I was a huge <i>Law & Order</i> whore.

And I called up my agent, and I was
like, "You never do anything for me."

He was like, "Excellent way
to start a conversation.

I can tell you want something."
I said, "Yes, I do.

I would love to be on <i>Law & Order</i>."

He's going, "What do you wanna play?
Like, the fucking suspect?

You want to be a lawyer? You know,
one of the defense attorneys?"

I said, "No, I just wanna be the guy
that leads them to the guy...

...that leads them to the guy
who leads them to the suspect."

He's like, "Let me see
what I can do."

Called back 10 minutes later,
he's like:

"You go to New York next week.
You're in."

I was like:

And I went, and I wound up being
the guy who lead them to a guy...

...who lead them to the guy
who lead them to the suspect.

You know, it was fucking awesome.
Yeah, I saw it.

It was kind of...
It was just fun to do.

It was creepy because
I wasn't expecting...

You know, <i>Law & Order</i>, in America,
is on pretty much 24 hours a day.

Yeah, basically.

I mean, it's on like four
different channels. USA, NBC...

But anyway, I was watching, I'm like...
TNT.

It's a good show to watch...

...when you basically don't wanna
watch anything...

...because everything's
wrapped up in an hour.

So I'm watching, I'm going, "Yeah..."
Well, that's like most TV.

Well, I know, I know.
Everything wraps up rather quickly.

Well, anyhow...

So I'm watching it, I'm mildly
interested, I go, "Kevin Smith!"

Yeah.

Now I've got heightened interest
in this one.

That was my reaction, as well,
and I knew I was gonna be in it.

What I did was,
I went to the mall, to a TV store...

...and just hung out there...

...turned every TV to fucking
<i>Law & Order</i> and waited.

And then when I popped up,
I was like, "Kevin Smith."

And there was one
65-year-old black guy...

...who was like,
"That's the dude from <i>Leno</i>."

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Yes?

Hi, what was it like working
with Will Ferrell...

...and have you got any funny stories
about that?

Again?

What was it like working
with Will Ferrell?

Will Ferrell.

I don't know what the fuck you said.

Honestly, I thought you were like,
"What was it like with Boba Fett?"

And I was like, "I don't know,
what was it like with Boba Fett?"

"Well, it was quite nice, actually."

What was it like working
with Will Ferrell?

You know, the dude's hysterical
as fucking hell.

Just really, really funny guy.

Constantly, like, making jokes,
but not like, you know... kind of jokes.

Just constantly funny.
Can't help but be funny.

Even when he tries to be serious,
the dude's kind of funny.

So no, like, killer fucking stories.

He would come in, shoot,
and then go back...

...because he was working on <i>SNL</i>
at the same time...

...so we didn't get to hang out much.

Do you...? You have any...?

No Will Ferrell stuff?

Nothing. Great guy.
No.

Funny.
Funny.

Sweet.

Can I ask Jason a question?
Yes, please do.

I was wondering
if you'd make my night...

...and say "snoochie boochies"
in a seductive way to me.

Oh, no.

I don't know if I can do that.

It's not a sexy word, is it?
Please?

Now you've got me on the spot.
I don't know if I can do this.

Hold on.
Let me get in the mood.

Snoochie boochies.

I tried.

I never had to do that before.

That might work, huh?
Are you a little wet in the pants?

Yeah.
You are?

It might work. I'm gonna try
that tonight when I go out.

I'll be like, "Snooch."

Thanks. Thank you.

I'm by myself.

Questions? Anywhere?
Fuck this thing. Fuck that.

Fuck these guys.

Up here.

Fuck that. You're too far.

Dude.

Fuck the mike.

It's my show now.

It's <i>Evening With Jay Mewes</i>. What?

Do something for us.
Do a monologue.

Do a monologue about...

...eating a clit, licking the clit.

Do it.

Okay.
All right.

You say you're the clit commander.

Can I be your commander in chief?
I like the clit too.

I love the clit. I love the clit.
And I take my... Just dip it in.

But you've got get the hood apart.
You've gotta just pry the hood apart.

And then just get your tongue
in just underneath there...

...and then just tease it, tease it
a little bit with your finger tip...

...and then slide underneath the clit,
and around...

...and then inside, inside, inside...

...and then back to the clit,
back to the clit.

Don't over do it. Not too hard.
Don't bite. Never bite the clit.

Never suck too hard.

Just lick it, lick it gently.

How was that?
Love that.

Was that okay?

If it was my movie, I'd cast you, sir.
Thank you.

If I could cast you, I would.
Thank you.

Awesome.

I might want you
to eat my ass tonight, sir.

Sorry, I don't do ass, sir.
Oh, come on, sir.

Oh, okay. Maybe in your case
I'll make an exception.

That was awesome.

You know Woody Allen
don't have q and a's like this.

Where were we?
I think she was...

She's got a mike.

Who was it?
Hi, I had a refined question.

But, no, after that.

Me and my friend Neil earlier were
talking about sex euphemisms.

My personal favorite being
"pole in the hole."

And Neil's... What was yours?

Would you like a portion?

Did you see my man?
Yeah.

You know, she's... You know
what she said, right? No?

I didn't hear a word.
Sex euphemisms.

What's your favorite sex euphemism?
And yours was what?

Pole in the hole.
Pole in the hole.

And she said... What's his name?
Neil.

And she goes, "Neil has one.
What's yours?"

And he goes:

She puts the mike down:

"Would you like a portion?"

It was the delivery that was genius.

Brilliant delivery.
Would you like a portion?

Right on.
That's my new euphemism.

What's yours?

It's that, now.

Would you like a portion?
What...? What is mine?

What's my favorite sex euphemism?

I don't even really have a dirty one...

...because my wife doesn't let me
get away with really dirty ones.

You're... What's yours?

How about "give her
a couple of inches"?

What's that?

A couple inches?

I said, "How about give her
a couple of inches?"

That's a... Really?
Is that what girls say over here?

Maybe just me.
Fuck, we're in the wrong country.

Because you asked for just a couple
inches, that's what you get from me.

It's all in.
It's there.

All in.
That's balls deep right there.

Can I ask a nicer question?

Have you ever been watching one
of your own movies...

...and sat there
and smugly thought to yourself:

"I'm a fucking comic genius"?

No.

I sit there, watch my own movies,
and I'm just like:

"Would you like a portion?"

No, I don't know, I rarely watch
the movies anymore, you know...

...because you spend so much
time with them, making them...

...that you don't really think about it.

But, you know, you spend one...
That makes no fucking sense.

You spend so much time
with the fucking movies...

...by the time the movie's done,
you don't want to ever see it again.

Like, I've seen every one of those
movies so many fucking times.

Then you let some years go by.

<i>Clerks</i> I was only able
to appreciate it again recently...

...because I hadn't watched it
in a while.

I was like, "It's pretty fucking good.
It's fun. This dude's funny."

But, never, never like,
"I'm a comic genius."

Because, like, my man who stood up
and did the fucking...

His clit monologue.

And suddenly I'm like,
"Well, anybody can do that shit."

He's lying. You're always just like,
"I'm fucking brilliant.

I'm so...

Mewes, leave."

Come on.
I wanna be alone with myself.

He does.
Would you like a portion?

What...?

What is your euphemism for sex?

"Knock the bottom out,"
you're talking about?

Knock the bottom out.
Knocking the bottom out.

Does that work?
Let me knock the bottom out.

So hit a girl...
Go ahead, hit her with it.

Come on, I already did the "snooch."
Come on.

Yeah, but you would never do
that in real life.

Like, "snoochie boochie."
No, I wouldn't.

After, how do you...?
How do you approach them?

You just say, "Let me knock the...
Let me knock the fucking bottom out"?

How do you say it?
I don't know.

I mean, mine's more jokey.
I'm not really...

So let's hear the joke.
I don't know, dude. There's a bunch:

"Knock the bottom out."
"Let me get up in them guts."

You do it.
What?

Let me...?
Let me get up in them guts.

Dude, your mom's here.
Don't ask me this stuff, sir.

I hate it.

Because you really...?
That fucking works on somebody?

No, it never works.

This is what works.

Not really.

Because that... Yeah, no...

I've got to piss really bad,
so I'm leaving.

And I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

And I'm gonna go jerk off.
All right.

I'm gonna go have
my balls washed, okay?

What did he say? What is it?
"Let me get up in them guts"?

Is that what he said?

Let me get up in them guts.

Would that work on you, if some dude
was like, "Let me get up in them guts"?

Maybe if it was Jason.
Usually not.

Like that,
with that harsh, hostile tone?

Let me get up in them guts.

I think I'd be like, "Oh, shit."

Try whispering it.

What is it?
Try whispering it.

Try whispering it?

I don't even think
the guy can pull that off.

It'd just sound spooky, wouldn't it?

There's nothing fun
about that, or playful.

Do you like your vag
being referred to as "guts"?

Let me get up in them guts.

Bloody hell, no.
You're the bear.

What was your favorite
euphemism?

Pole in the hole?
Pole in the hole.

That's how you refer to it?
Not normally, but it amuses me.

Not normally, though?

No, I understand what
pole in the hole means...

...but thank you
for the demonstration.

Because that was a little...
"What does she mean?

Pole in the hole?"

That's when you're sitting around
with your girlfriends:

"Oh, we got a little pole in the hole
last night."

But you don't say it to your man.
You're not like, "Come on..."

If I'm out with my lady friends, it's
"giving away the whole pudding," or...

What is it?
"Giving away the whole pudding."

I didn't hear that. What?
Giving away the whole pudding.

"Giving away the whole pudding"?
Yes.

You British broads are dirty.

I mean, when you say
"the whole pudding"...

...you mean H-O-L-E,
or W-H-O-L-E?

Like "giving away
the whole pudding"...

...or "giving away the hole pudding"?

Whichever takes your fancy,
go for it.

Or a bit of fanny fun.

What was the other one?
A bit of fanny fun.

A bit of funny fur?

Fanny fun.

Fanny fun?
Fanny fun.

Family fun?

Fanny fun.
Spell.

F-A-N-N-Y.
Fanny fun. Like ass play?

No, no.

Not ass play?
"Fanny" here means "fanjita."

What is it?

Pussy.

"Fanny" covers pussy here as well?
"Fanny" means "pussy" here.

Back home, fanny is your ass.
Yeah, no.

It's not here?
No.

That would...
I could see why every British...

British woman I've tried to fuck
has been very confused.

"Would you like a bit of fanny fun?"

"Oh, Jesus. Yes."

"I said, fanny fun."

"So did I."

So fanny is the front part,
the girl part.

It is indeed.
It's literally ass back home.

Like, "I'll spank you on your fanny."
Not here.

Wouldn't wanna get spanked
on your fanny.

Nasty surprises.
No.

How many international incidents
have been caused...

...because of that, you know...?

Fanny fun. Interesting.

Two company...
What is it, two countries...?

Two countries separated by
a common language, is that it?

It all comes down to "fanny fun."
Yes. And the word "fanny."

I think that was the cause
of the Revolutionary War.

I think so too.

Excuse me.
Yes?

After that conversation what does your
mother think of you and your career?

I don't know.
Can we ask?

It was weird, when I knew I was
coming over here, I was like:

"Would you would you wanna come
and see me do q and a in England...

...because it's just like doing
the q and a in America...

...but everyone sounds smarter."

Except for that broad, but...

I forgot that the show tends
to be a little bit blue.

She has spent a lot of show
with her head shaking.

Have you really been shaking,
up there just editorializing?

Shaking your head like:

My mother, in the beginning,
I remember, when the movies...

When <i>Clerks</i> got picked up and shit,
she was just like:

"I think it's terrible.
All they do is curse in the movie...

...and I think that reflects
poorly on me."

I was like, "Really?"

She's going, "Everyone's gonna think
that I raised you with a potty mouth."

And I was like,
"Ma, I'll set them straight."

So here's me doing it.
And my mother never cursed at me.

My mother's one
of those people that's like:

"Oh, H-E, double hockey sticks."

She don't curse, really.
Until you get her really fucking mad.

And then she's like,
"Fuck that fanny fun."

Thank you. Yes?

Jason, I saw <i>R.S. V.P.</i>
Let me get up in them guts.

Did it work? No?
All right, whatever.

Yeah, let me find out.

How old are you?
Seventeen.

I was gonna say, she's a child.
Oh, wait.

"I'm 14.

What guts are you talking about?

Mommy."

I'm out of here. Probation.

<i>R.S. V.P.</i> what?

I saw <i>R.S. V.P.</i>
And <i>Tail Lights Fade</i> too.

I was wondering does anyone offer you
any other kind of role other than Jay?

Here and there.

Here and there. Not a lot, though.

But I'm doing a movie,
we start shooting next month.

This guy Erik wrote and directed.
It's called <i>Bottom's Up.</i>

It's about fucking.

No, but Paris Hilton's in it.

So hopefully we'll be fucking.

Not really.

But she is in it,
and I think Paul Walker is in it...

...and some other dude,
I don't know.

It's like a $3 million budget.

But, no, you know, no one's beating
my door down...

...for <i>Batman</i> or anything like that.

So...
Is that the dream?

Why, are you giving me a job offer?
You got a movie?

My friend sort of does.

Not movie. Not a movie.

Just this stupid thing.
He's gonna kill me.

Does this movie involve
a video camera and...?

Yes.

And Mewes and...?
No, it's just skateboarding and things.

It's stupid.

There you go, dude.
I can do some moves, right?

Yeah, you can fucking ollie a bus.
I could kickflip.

Totally.
Right?

I'll let him know.
I can't.

Is that your dream role? Batman?

No, no.
"Nobody's offering me <i>Batman</i>."

Like if somebody called right now like,
"Will you play Batman?"

You're like, "I'm gone, moves."

No, I don't...
You wouldn't do it?

I couldn't be the Dark Knight, sir.

I couldn't play that.

What a sincere answer that was.

Not like, "That would never happen,"
or, "You know, it would just..."

"I couldn't be the Dark Knight, sir."

Thanks so much.
Thank you.

Okay, going up.

Yeah.
Good evening to both of you.

It's a question...

So very British.

"Yes, good evening to both of you."

I do have a question
for both of you.

If you had the job of deciding
the official word of the day...

...what would today's
word be and why?

The official word of the day?
Official word of the day.

Can it be a hyphenate word?
Sure.

"Fanny-fun."

"Polish."

Thank you.
Thank you, good night.

Thanks, that was easy.

Shit, why aren't they all like that?

Who's got it over here?
Or you can pass it over to somebody.
