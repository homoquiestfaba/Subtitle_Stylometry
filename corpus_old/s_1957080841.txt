[helicopter blades whirring]

[music continues]

[handcuffs clicking]

[buzzer blares]

[door slams]


<i>thank you for accepting
the call.</i>

Uh, can I speak to Greg Bernard,
please?

[woman over phone] <i>Mr. Reid,
Mr. Bernard isn't available.</i>

All right, can you put me
through to his cellphone?

It's urgent that I speak to him.

There was a situation
in general population.

It wasn't my fault,
but they sent me

to solitary confinement
for it as punishment.

I can let Mr. Bernard know.</i>

No, ma'am, just don't apologize.

Just listen to me, okay?

They... they've confiscated
all my belongings.

I don't have anything,
not a pencil, not a paper.

So unless Greg can help me
retrieve my things,

I won't be able to mail out
my statement

for petition to appeal.

It was supposed to go out today
for my hearing next week.

Do you understand?

<i>I'm being informed</i>

<i>that your hearing
was postponed.</i>

[Harlow sighs]

Okay, okay. This is... excellent.

Thank you.
When is it rescheduled for?

How long do I have
to get my statement in to Greg?

<i>I'm sorry, but</i>

<i>your hearing has been
postponed indefinitely.</i>

You said you were just informed.

By who,
one of the other partners?

Can I speak to one of them,
please?

Put them on the phone.

[tapping gate]

They... they're gonna send me
back to my cell.

Can you put one of them
on the phone, please?

<i>That's just not possible.</i>

I don't think you understand me.

They've given me a life sentence
and I'm innocent.

This is not a joke.

<i>Mr. Reid, I'm sorry.</i>

Why do you keep
apologizing to me?

Just put one of them
on the phone.

received notice in the mail.</i>

<i>You're being sued
in civil court.</i>

<i>Your assets have been frozen.</i>

<i>And since you're technically
unable to pay,</i>

<i>the firm has decided not
to move forward with your case.</i>

Greg would not do that to me.

We have been friends
since middle school.

We sent you the documents</i>

<i>so you can refile your appeal
with a public defender.</i>

<i>Or you can represent yourself.</i>

<i>I'm really very sorry.</i>


[tense music]

[gate clanks]
[buzzer blares]

Let's walk.

It's just a random check.

For what?

[guard 2] What's this?

You know,

there is nothing
that you can think of

that I haven't thought first.

[music continues]

Oh, what's wrong?

I thought all dogs like
the smell of their own rectum.

That's not mine.

According to who?

It's according to whom.

Oh, it's according to whom.
[chuckles]



Yeah.

If you were smart
as you think you are,

you wouldn't be here,

would you, Dr. Reid?

I read your file.

I got a jacket on...

all the inmates here in the SHU.

I was already searched.

Oh, not by me.

You see, if I had to strip
searched you and this turned up

stashed in your cavity,

I would have shoved my boot
so far up your ass,

this razor would have
come out of your mouth.

Get up.

First offense is 90 days.

Anything like this
happens again,

I'm gonna add on a whole year.

[door shuts]

[peaceful music]


You like to hurt women? [laughs]

Yeah, you know that's why Sacks
is fucking with you, right?

Hey, friend,
with all due respect,

it's been a long day.

I really don't feel like
talking right now,

so if you don't mind.

Excuse me, guard.

When do I get my belongings?

My legal papers.
It's... it's urgent.

I need them today.

the Four Seasons, motherfucker.

[footsteps receding]

[toilet flushes]

[tense music]

[toilet flushes]

[toilet flushes]

[water rushing]

[toilet flushes]

[toilet flushes]

[toilet flushes]
[alarm blares]


[banging on door]

Goddammit, Zeke.

Pull the mattress
off the window.

[indistinct shouting]

Keep this up and you will
suffer the consequences.

in this prison...

This ain't right.
[toilet flushes]

[indistinct shouting]

The fucking bitches...

[indistinct shouting]
[Zeke] Don't!


let me out of here!

[indistinct shouting]

[guard] We're coming in.
[Sacks] Three seconds.



[indistinct shouting]


One. Open the cell door.

[shouting indistinctly]


away from me!

[banging]
[indistinct shouting]


You're breaking my fucking arm!

You're breaking my arm!

Fuck you!

[indistinct shouting]

Show the warden some respect.


Ow! You're fucking hurting me!


[imitating monkey]

[ominous music]

[indistinct chattering]

[Sacks whistles]


[Sacks continues whistling]

My tray, I don't think
I had a full portion.

Can I have a little bit more?

Please?

[ominous music]

Oh, don't you look nice.

Sorry I'm late.

It's okay.

Understood.

Careful.

Thank you.

Oh, look.

It's our guardian angel.

It's what we call pareidolia.

Our brains are wired
to perceive faces in things.

It's actually a form of
pattern recognition.

Can't I just appreciate
the view?

You don't think that that's...

Interesting?

Mm-mm.

So, you didn't bring any clothes
to work in?

I thought the whole point
of buying this boat

was so that we can relax.

We haven't even started.

Baby, it's such a beautiful day.

Why can't we just enjoy it?

Why don't we take the boat out
for a lap around the bay,

and then we'll work, I promise.

We need this.

We need what?

To fix this.

[ominous music]

I'd like to share with you,

one that occurs to me
in times like this.

Let every man be subject
to the governing authorities

for there is no authority
except from God.

And those authorities
that do exist,

have been instituted by God.

Yeah.

I don't like
the segregated housing unit.

It changes people.

Every time an inmate has to be
extracted, they call me down

and I see it firsthand.

That man in the cell
next to you, Zeke,

he flooded out his cell
because he was desperate,

desperate for human contact.

I have a prison to run.

I have a responsibility
to my staff

and to the other inmates
to segregate the troublemakers.


That's not mine.

You know that.

It was in your mattress.

Maybe...
I can help you help yourself.

If, for instance,
you were willing to enroll

in a behavior modification
program,

I can commute your stay
in the segregated housing unit.

You would be able to reenter

the general population
immediately.

What does one have to do
to get into this program?


Just obey the rules,

and sign a confession.

The road to rehabilitation
starts with acceptance.

[tense music]

No.

Harlow.

move me to a new cell?

You two deserve each other.


Do you believe in God?

[music continues]


I know you hear me, boy.

I'm trying to save your life.

How's that?

If you got something to say,
say it.

Otherwise, just leave me alone.

look out in the hallway.

Do you see them lights,

the long ones up there
on the ceiling?

That's where they live.

They feed on the energy
and travel through the vents.

That's how they get
into the cells.

Do you believe in ghosts?

I'm afraid whatever it is
you think you're seeing,

that's just your mind's way
of... of keeping you company.

to keep me company.

They're trying to kill me!

Who's trying to kill you?

we all got victims.

Some of those victims, the ones
who ain't with us no more,

they're looking for revenge.

It sounds like you're having
a crisis of conscience.


You sound like a shrink.

A psychiatrist, yes.

talk to me, motherfucker!

Hey, I was not passing judgment.

All right, you're the one
that said you wanted to talk.

something then?

Like...

how'd you kill your wife?

[tense music]

I'm innocent!

I'm innocent.

[sirens wailing in distance]

[buzzer blares]

and I hear this groaning.

So I walk down the hall

and I see this
big Mexican motherfucker.

He's holding his cock
in one hand

and squeezing his wrist with the
other,

trying to cut
the circulation off.

You know, apparently,
it feels like someone else

is jerking you fuckin' off.

[man 2] I think
I'll have to try that.

[ominous music]

[voices whispering]

[fan whirring]

[ominous music]

[voices whispering]

[music continues]

[fly buzzes]


[seagulls squawking]

The sooner we resurface
this deck,

the sooner that Amber sets sail.

[suspenseful music]

[thunder rumbles]


What?

[ominous music]

So,

you do still love me?

[tense music]

Free at last.

Free at last.

[Sacks whistles]

Sacks!

Uh, Sacks, Sacks,
excuse me, please.

I'm so sorry,
but can I just have, um...

can I have a sharpened pencil,
please, something that works?

You want a pencil, huh.

Yeah, if it's not too much
trouble, that'd be nice.

Thank you.

How does it feel to want?

[tense music]

them treat you like a bitch,</i>

I'm gonna have to
take care of myself.

Yeah, I'm talking to you.

[tense music]

All right, all right.

I am an innocent man</i>

<i>serving a life sentence
in a federal penitentiary.</i>

<i>I respectfully request
an opportunity</i>

<i>to appeal my conviction.</i>

Look at that!

<i>It gives me great pleasure
to inform you</i>

<i>that I have discovered evidence
within my case file</i>

<i>that was never presented
at my original trial.</i>

Fucking lawyers.

<i>Due to the negligence
of my attorney,</i>

<i>I've decided to act
as my own counsel</i>

<i>and will be filing my petition
to appeal personally.</i>

They're gonna get the truth,
Zeke.

Soon enough.

Go thank your friend, Harlow.

I want you so bad right here.

No.

Right now.

I'm sweating.

Right now, I don't care
that you're sweating.

Besides, people are gonna see.

I don't care who sees.

No, you can wait.

This is what you get
for putting me to work.

Suit yourself.


[tool whirs]

[Amber chuckles]
[tool whirs]

[Amber chuckles]

You know what?
If you keep that up,

<i>you might get
what you're looking for.</i>

[somber music]

[ominous music]

[whispering indistinctly]

[Amber moans]

[banging on door]

We got a pervert in the house!

up and offed themselves

in the last 24 months.

No one even bats an eye.

She ain't gonna stop.

All she has to do
is keep us here.

The SHU does all the work
for her.

[tool whirs]

[phone beeps]

[seagulls squawking]

You got a message.


You sure?

can wait.

Who was it?

My mother.

I told her not to call me
this weekend.

What does she want?

[Amber exhales]

Mm.

I'll call her later.

You sure? You can just,

you can call her now
if you want.

[tense music]

What did she want?

[seagulls squawking]

What did she text you?
Nothing.

Nothing.

Show me the text.

I want you to show me
the message right now.

<i>How does it feel to want?</i>

[Amber gasps]

[alarm blares]


It can't be.

[breathing heavily]
I've seen your face.


You had a face like an angel's.

What happened
to your beautiful face?

are you talking to, Zeke?


Stop! Stop looking at me!

Get away from me! [sobs]


[suspenseful music]

[man] Help!
[electricity buzzing]

Call the warden.

[indistinct shouting]


what have you done?


[Zeke screams]

Ezekiel!

Zeke!

What happened, man?

Hello?

[tense music]

[somber music]

please accept my apology</i>

<i>for the time it's taken
to draft my personal statement</i>

<i>and file for an appeal.</i>

<i>It's become
increasingly difficult</i>

<i>to obtain a suitable
writing utensil</i>

<i>while serving time in the SHU.</i>

Hey, Ezekiel! [laughs]

Sacks!

Can I just get just
like a little bit more food?

[fly buzzes]

[pencil snaps]

I demand

a new pencil.

How long you been up, Harlow?

You can't stop me
from filing my appeal.

I want my pencil.


Maybe you oughta just...

lie down.

Go to sleep.

I want a pencil.

Now.

Hmm.

Maybe tomorrow.

[music continues]

[fly buzzes]

[intense buzzing]


[intense buzzing]


Rule number one,
don't let nobody,

nobody disrespect you
up in here.

They don't know
what you're capable of,

but I do.

My nigga! [laughs]

[dramatic music]


is my birthday.

Hey, yo, Zeke.

Ezekiel!

Is this your doing, Zeke?

[distorted voice] Harlow.

Use the ink
that's flowing in your veins.

Yo, Zeke, is that you?


Man, man.

You gonna leave me over here
alone like this, man?

Not bad, not bad.

[ominous music]

I intend to prove</i>

<i>that unfair racial profiling
led to my arrest,</i>

<i>and the selection of a jury</i>

<i>with preconceived notions
about my character.</i>

<i>Requestioning key witnesses
will prove this theory.</i>

<i>You should also know
there's a corrections officer</i>

<i>here in the SHU
determined to silence me</i>

<i>by any means necessary.</i>

I just wanted to talk to my mom.

I don't think there's anything
wrong with that.

It's not gonna work like this.

You are a control freak.

You still don't get that
you brought this on yourself.

Things were like this
before the affair.

Everything I say to you,
you end up using it against me.

You're constantly
looking over my shoulder

and second-guessing
everything I do.

What do you want?

[tense music]

I don't want anything.

You don't want anything?

Then fuck off then!

Why did you bring me here?

Do you have any idea what
kind of man they'll think I am?

I don't wanna be
analyzed by you.

I just needed to talk.

There's nothing wrong with me
talking to my own mother.

You don't think that
she's gonna tell him?

What do you care
what my father...

Because!

He gave me the money to start
my fucking practice, Amber!

So this is about money.

This is about me
not having to defend my choice

not to leave you!

I'm gonna make this
easy for you.

Hey.


[Sacks] To the window!
[banging on door]

When we call you to the window,
you get up and move.

Get dressed.

Mr. Reid.

I have good news for you.

Your time in the segregated
housing unit is up.

I trust you're ready
to try again

back in the general population.

God, yes.

Thank you.

Thank God indeed.

You'll have to spend a few weeks
in the step down unit.

Good luck.

Prepare the prisoner's
personal items.




Thank you.

Warden.


What happened to Zeke?

Zeke.

If I were you, I wouldn't
concern myself with him.

Come on.

[ominous music]

[music continues]

[gate rattling]

[indistinct shouting]

[buzzer blares]
[gate rattling]

Face the bars, prisoner.

[gate rattling]
[buzzers blares]

You know, if...

if things were different,

I might actually have been able
to help you.

Huh/

Too bad there's not
a couch in here, huh, Harlow?

[elevator dings]

Go on.

I hope whoever cut you
got what they deserved.

Two years.

Two years in the SHU

plus the time
he'd already served.

And every night, I go home,
look in the mirror,

and think to myself

if today that sorry excuse
for a human being

just happened to,
you know, stop breathing,

I'd be doing the world
a huge favor.

[ominous music]

And every day, I decided
I was better than that,

so I did nothing.

You did the right thing.

[Sacks scoffs]

Piece of shit.

Eventually got out on parole.

Within a few months, he was
back to his lowlife ways,

driving around
with a truck full of drugs.

Cops pursued him
for almost 26 miles.

Finally, he lost control.

[elevator dinging]

He plowed into
a 13-year-old girl

waiting for a school bus.

[music continues]

That's when I knew,

people like him...

[elevator rumbling]
[bell ringing]

[suspenseful music]

...people like you...

don't deserve second chances.

[dramatic music]

You will be back in the SHU,
Harlow.

And you'll do the dirty work
for me,

just like...

the guy...

who gave me this.

I can't wait to see you
swinging from your bed sheet.

For me,

that's justice enough.

[elevator dings]

[somber music]

[Sacks whistles]

[tense music]

[suspenseful music]


[thudding
[grunting]

Hey!

[Harlow screams]

[distorted shouting]

convict, now!

Don't move!

[Harlow screams]
[Sacks shouts]

[Harlow screams]

[somber music]

[machine beeping steadily]

[phone beeps]

[intense music]

What did she text you?
Nothing.

Nothing.

Show me the text.

I want you to show me
the message right now.

[intense music]


<i>I needed to talk to my mom</i>

and there's nothing wrong
with that.

And every time
I try to talk to you,

you end up using
everything against me.

You're looking over my shoulder

and you're second-guessing
everything I do.

And it's not gonna work
like this.

No, you're right,
it's not gonna work this way

'cause you still don't get...

that you brought this
on yourself.


[ominous music]

[door slams]


<i>Looks like Officer Sacks</i>

<i>gave you more than</i>
<i>just a pencil.</i> [laughs]

[tense music]

[voices whisper]

[electricity buzzes]

[suspenseful music]

[Harlow screams]



Help!

You just earned yourself
another 90 days, prisoner.

No!

No!

Get up.
No!

No!
Go get yourself cleaned up.

We should call psych.
No, no, no.

[banging on door]

Pull back, prisoner!

You go ahead and get cleaned up.

I got this.
I'll take care of the trays.

Fine.

I'll be right back.

If you're gonna act
like an animal,

I'm gonna treat you
like an animal.

Please.

Eat up, Harlow.

I would rather starve.

I can wait if you can.

[dramatic music]


Fuck Sacks.


Trust in God.


<i>swinging from your bed sheet.</i>

Shank that bitch in the neck.

<i>You had a face like an angel.</i>

<i>What happened
to your beautiful face?</i>

[distorted voice]
<i>Do you love me?</i>


<i>You know, Harlow.</i>

<i>You know what you did.</i>

Sign a confession.

[Harlow grunts]

[suspenseful music]

[Amber moans]

[Harlow pants]

[tense music]

Thank you.

Yes.

Just the way I like it.

<i>Bon appetit.</i>

[Sacks laughs]

You're trying to bait me into
being the kind of man

that you think that you deserve.

When I spoke to my mother,
it was in a moment of weakness.

You don't get to call it
a moment of weakness

when you can't get through
an entire day

without having a breakdown.

Have you been taking the pills
that I gave you?

There's nothing wrong with me.

You don't like the way
that you feel without them.

The issue
will not resolve itself, Amber.

The issue is that I don't like
the way you treat me.

Stop!

Respect me.

I'm sorry.


<i>What is it you want?</i>

To get outta here.

[Amber laughs]

Zeke.


<i>What you want, Harlow?</i>

<i>If we was anywhere else
but here,</i>

<i>you wouldn't even give me
the time of day.</i>

<i>You're just one of them
fair-weathered friends,</i>

<i>ain't you, Harlow?</i>

[electricity buzzing]

No, I'm not.

You got this, motherfucker.

Come on, Harlow.

Man the fuck up!

We gonna be in here
for the rest of our lives.

Better get used to this.

You part of the statistic now.

One in three, that's your ass.

Plus my ass.

That's two, 2.3 million
motherfuckers in jail,

behind bars!

You're one of 'em.

You a slave.

They took away the chains,
put them shits back on

'cause you fucked up!

No.

This is your fault.

It was an accident
and you know that.

You,

you bad.

You know.

No.

You know.

You know.

<i>Harlow, you guilty as hell.</i>

<i>You might as well cop to it.</i>


Zeke?

Zeke?

Talk to me, Zeke.

You're all that I have.

What?

I didn't do it.

I didn't do it.

I didn't do it.

No, I didn't...

What's happening to me?

[music continues]

Did I fucking do it?

I didn't do it.

I didn't do it.

What?

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

I didn't do it.

I... no.

What?

What?

[muttering indistinctly]

[suspenseful music]

Respect...

me.
Stop it.

[voice echoing]
[intense music]

[Amber gasps]

[ominous music]

[dramatic music]

[Amber sobs]

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

[Sacks screams]

[Harlow screams]

[tense music]

I did it.

I did it.

I killed my wife.

I wanna do the program.

You killed your wife and
now you wanna make a deal?

Yeah.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Thank you, yes.

Please.

Get me outta here.

Not on my watch.

<i>Get the fuck away from me.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait, no, no.</i>

<i>Don't touch me.</i>

<i>No! No, no, no.</i>

[electricity buzzing]


[voices whispering]

[Amber screams]

Warden!

I'm ready to do the program!

Come get me!

I'm ready!

Come get me!

I'm ready to do the program!

I'm ready to accept
responsibility for my actions!

Come on!

Come on and get me!

Come get me!

Let me out!

Let me out!

Let me out!

Let me out!

Please.

[toilet flushing]

[toilet flushing]

[water bubbling]


Come on!

Warden!

Yes!

Come get me!

Come on!

I wanna see the warden!

[alarm blares]
Help!

I need help!

Get me out of here!

I'm done!

I'm done!

Lord Jesus Christ,
please have mercy on us.

[Amber gasps]
[Harlow grunts]


Stop it.

[Amber screams]

[intense music]

I'll never let you go.

[tense music]

[music intensifying]

[intense music]

[Harlow screams]

Stand up, prisoner.

Please.

I'll sign whatever you want,
please.

Just get me Perez.

[alarm continues blaring]

Get him cleaned up.

Go!


[tense music]

[buzzer blares]

[Harlow, distorted]
<i>We need to fix this.</i>

[Amber, distorted]
<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

[voices whispering]

You're making
the right decision.

We'll be able to get you
into a program

within a couple of weeks.

[intense music]

[Amber screams]

Get away from me, please.


Stop wasting everyone's time.

Uncuff the prisoner.

[intense music]

Respect...

me.
Stop it.

[Amber screams]

If you are not going to sign
the document,

you need to go back
to your cell.

I'm walking away.

Mr. Reid?

[intense music]

[Amber gasps]

No!

[tense music]

Take the prisoner
back to the SHU.


Stop this at once!

Let her go.

[Sacks grunting]
[guard] Drop the weapon.

Remove the pen from
Officer Sacks's throat.

She's trying
to make me kill myself.

No idea how crazy you sound.

Officer Sacks, not another word!

She's torturing me.

She's torturing Zeke.

I'm not the only one.


Just listen to me, okay?

Just watch the security tapes!

She's trying
to turn my mind against me!

I'm not going back there
with her.

I will look into this.

Trust God.
If you're a man of God,

then check
the damn security tapes.

I'm begging you.

You have my word.

Just let go.

I can't.

Let go.

Let go, Harlow.


Let go.

[Sacks grunts]


Stand down!

Get out.

[dark music]

back to his cell, sir.

Last chance.

I might be guilty
of a lot of things,

but I know I am not guilty
of killing my wife.

[thunder rumbles]

<i>While serving hard time</i>
