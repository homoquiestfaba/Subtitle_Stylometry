[MUSIC JACK MARTIN AND THE TYREE
BROTHERS, "HOUND DOG"]

Y'all know why white
women PMS, right?

Because they deserve it, man.

Hell, boy, I don't care.

I pull that string
out with my teeth,

Flop it back and forth to
make me some red wings.

I ain't into that
crime scene sex.

Hell yeah.

Y'all some sick fucks.

I just like the extra lube, man.

Hell, boy, I don't care.

Bloody or not, here I come.

We ain't worried
about the women.

The only two things that
matter in the deer woods

Is cold beer and no
nagging old lades.

And weed.

REDNECK: Hell, yeah.

Careful, it's got a
bit of creep on it.

We're in for some
good hunting, boys.

[Typewriter sound]


[Air raid siren]

Fuck, what was that?

I thought you said

You already freaking out.

I ain't freaking out.

Shut up.

I'm going to check it out.

Oh, shit!

Good morning.

First of all, I'd like to
remind everybody of the exam, 9

O'clock Monday morning.

It's going to cover
all the material up to

And including what
we talk about today.

So open your text to chapter 13.

We're going to talk a
little bit about cost

Benefit analysis, which we
started discussing last week.

A major consideration
in assessment

Of feasibility of any
project that you undergo

Is the cost benefit analysis.

It would be foolish.

So cost benefit analysis is a
decisive step in the systems.

Roger, Stacy?

So nice of you to join us today.

I hope coming here
didn't (DISTORTED)

Put you out too much?

Sorry, Miss Gerlen.

Yeah, sorry we're late.

We, uh.

["Jeopardy" style music playing]

We had a flat tire.

Well, at least you're
creative with poor excuses.

Do you have your report
finished, you know,

The one on macroeconomic
analysis, the one

That's due this morning?

Uh, my cat ate it?

Class, please pass
up your reports.

Good citizens, we have a
major epidemic on our hands.

Our sources have reported a new
virus has infected our people.

Scientists are baffled
by the recent deaths

Of three rednecks,
two yuppies, four

Trekkies, and some other
people not worth mentioning.

We have no idea how
this virus works.

And we're pretty sure
there is no cure.

So stay inside, people,
and remember stay clean.


Avoid unsafe sex.

Stay in school.

And most of all,
don't have any fun.

To that devil worship music.

Yeah, but I know

Oh, my god, it was so gross.

I tried to run away, but I
slipped on the blood. [Sobbing]

Ahh.

Eww.

Eww.

Eww.

Miss Stacy, I knew her.

Actually, now that Roger's

It was all right.

Well, as you can see, the kids

[Music playing]

In 1988, I had this
tabby cat named Wanda.

Of course, my girlfriend, she
hated the cat at the time.

I loved that cat.

I still have that cat.

I lost the girl.

And in 1990, after
my hernia operation,

I was riding this
pony named Bugs

Right down to a swamp gully.

That's what it was,
a swamp gully, yeah.

And, anyway, that
thing was so fast,

It ran and it ran and it
ran right into the lake.

Drowned himself.

And then I got this other pony.

I, uh, forgot what his name was.

But we had it for my
six-year-old daughter's

Birthday party, because all of
the kids wanted to ride a pony.

So we got the pony,
and then, right

In the middle of that party,
that pony just dropped dead.

I thought that, oh, the kids
are going to be disappointed.

But I wasn't going
to let it happen.

I'm going to let them
kids ride that pony.

I let four of them sit
on that pony, and I drug

It around in a circle.

That's what I did.

That's when I realized
that ponies was stupid.

So I guess better just
stick with tabby cats.

What are you talking about?

That's the thing
about driving a cab.

Some days are good.

Some days are bad.

You got to roll with
the punches, you know,

Keep your head up.

And you can't go
looking for trouble

When trouble is spelled with
two T's and an eight-ball.

And in 1982, I was a clown
traveling with the circus.

Then I met this dude.

He was a lion tamer,
a big son of a bitch.

He was a big son of a bitch.

I'm telling you, he
would six-foot eight.

Yes, he was.

His name was C.J. Lerone.

Old C.J., he don't
take know guff.

He says, I like them lions.

And I liked him.

I liked him a lot.

That's when I got
my first cat, Barry.

He got hit by a train.

Flattened him out
like a pancake.

As you can imagine, I, I was
fairly distraught over it.

Oh, god, I feel like shit.

Oh, and one time,
I accidentally

Lit my cat, Jerry, on fire.

I didn't know what the cat was.

God, I was drunk.

Can I tell you what?

I feel like shit.

[Voice sped up and distorted]

Just let me out here.

Fucking zombies, always
messing up my cab.

Well, at least
she left her weed.

Oh.
