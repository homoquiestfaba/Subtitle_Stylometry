Damn it.

What's that up there?

It's a terrible place,
a place filled with sickness and suffering.

Never go there.

Do you hear me? Never!

But why?
Because that's where she died.

Who died?

Me!

Miss.

Miss.

What is your name?

Heather. Heather Reed.

Miss Reed, today's the first day of my class.

And if I bore you already, you should
probably find another university to attend.

However, if you'd like to join the rest of us
and possibly learn something...

I highly suggest
you sleep on your own time.

As I was saying...

White Death claimed more than 60,000 lives
in this county alone.

Or, as some like to refer to it,
as the romantic disease.

It took you
when you were young and beautiful.

Remember, there will be a biology test...

and 10-page report due on modern medicine
and the cure for this horrific disease.

Have a nice weekend.

Miss Reed, try and get some sleep.

I don't know what's going on.

Heather, wait up.

Are you all right? What happened in there?

I don't know.
I haven't been sleeping much lately.

Why, you seem to be doing
a lot of it in class.

I'm sorry. This is my friend, Tori.

Hi.
Hi.

Heather just transferred here
from Danver State.

Heather. Hey, are you okay?

"Truth or Scare. Annual Initiation Party.

"Provocative Bedtime Attire A Must."

Definitely not.

Oh, no, but you have to go.

It'll give you the opportunity
to meet more people.

And it's only the most important event
of the year.

Besides, I was kind of hoping
that maybe you could bring Tori.

She lives right by you.

Okay. What the hell. We'll all go.

Welcome to Truth or Scare...

<i>broadcasting live
from the scariest place on Earth.</i>

<i>Are we having fun yet?</i>

<i>Each contestant will be blindfolded and
placed on separate floors of this building.</i>

<i>There, they will be free to remove
their blindfolds and explore the corridors.</i>

<i>If they dare!</i>

<i>The rooms and corridors have been
equipped with hidden cameras...</i>

<i>just to make sure there is no cheating.</i>

<i>Everything is going according to plan.</i>

<i>Anybody could scare these girls.</i>

<i>It's a piece of fucking cake.</i>

<i>My rules.</i>

<i>My initiation.</i>

So, what brings you here?

My parents went here, so...

I think they want me to be just like them.

But they're important,

so nobody's special except them.

Nice outfit.

Thanks. I'm Tori, this is Heather.

Devon.

Sure, I'll have another one.

That's okay, Heather, I'll get it.

Come on, girls.

<i>You cannot stay in one place
for more than one hour.</i>

<i>You must spend the entire five hours inside,
no matter what happens.</i>

<i>Now, at your feet you will find a key
that will allow you to remove your masks...</i>

<i>and face your fears.</i>

<i>Remember, five floors...</i>

<i>five girls...</i>

<i>five hours.</i>

What the fuck!

<i>I almost forgot.</i>

<i>Did I mention five ghosts?</i>

Five ghosts?

Fuck you, Ashley, for getting me into this.

<i>Where the fuck is she anyway?</i>

Hang on. They changed our clothes.

<i>Well, you girls have a great time. I gotta run.</i>

<i>Who is Elizabeth?</i>

Devon?

<i>... told me that I'm gonna be better.
That I'm cured.</i>

<i>Elizabeth.</i>

<i>Elizabeth.</i>

Devon?

Devon? Devon!

Devon!

Devon?

Jesus, man.

Can you hold the damn light straight?

I'm trying, man.
It's just so fucking cold in here.

Look, I'm going as fast as I can.

Now this shit's gotta work.
Not like the last time when you did it.

You burned
the whole fucking building down.

<i>You're just lucky I was there
to bail your sorry ass out.</i>

Fuck you, man.

Fuck you.

<i>- Fuck you!
Fuck you!</i>

Is everybody having fun tonight?

All right, welcome to Truth or Scare.

This is the wildest initiation party
of the year.

A few of you ladies out there will be
fortunate enough to attend all our parties...

hang out at the best house on campus...

and some will even get to know me
a whole lot better.

Ladies, please, please. I'm flattered, really.
But it's not that easy.

We have a special initiation process
for you this year.

Watch it, bitch!

Ashley's got real class, huh?

She's Miss Rich Bitch. Her family
owns about half the real estate in Kentucky.

Who's he?

That's Richie.
She acts like she owns him, too.

<i>Forget it, though.
He's way out of your league.</i>

Okay.

You ready?

Five floors.

Five girls.

Five hours.

<i>You make me sick.</i>

<i>Now I make you sick.</i>

It's just a game.

I wanna go home!

I wanna go home!

<i>I wanna go home!</i>

<i>You are home.</i>

<i>I hate all of you incurable people.</i>

<i>Ashley?</i>

<i>Liz, is that you?</i>

Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.

I'm scared.

Look, I just wanna go home.

Stop! Stop! Stop!

Shit. I'm never gonna get out of here.

Shit!

<i>Oh, that's good. Five ghosts.</i>

<i>My rules.</i>

<i>My initiation.</i>

Gio, where the fuck are you, man?

Tell them, Don.

<i>Thank you, Richard.</i>

<i>We're live, via satellite, from hell.</i>

<i>Five lucky contestants will be chosen...</i>

<i>to spend the night
in a place of unimaginable terror.</i>

<i>Anybody could scare these girls.
It's a piece of fucking cake.</i>

Shit.

Where the fuck is everybody?

<i>Oh, Richie, you really know
how to show a girl a good time.</i>

"Scariest place on Earth."
Are you kidding me?

Where did you find this place?

Another one of your family's
twisted secrets?

What's with that skank Heather?

I see the way you've been looking at her.

<i>You know, sometimes...</i>

I wonder why I ever picked
a loser like you anyhow.

<i>You're weak, Richie.</i>

You walk around pretending
like you're something special.

But inside...

you're just like the rest of those...

incurable people.

Don't you ever fucking call me that again.

Face it, Richie,
you're the disease and I'm the cure.

And, baby, you'll never see these again.

<i>Ciao.</i>

Tori, there's something here.

I feel it.

What are you talking about?

There's something wrong.
There's so much pain.

They say this place is haunted.

You know, a TB hospital.

I heard 63,000 people died here.

It's so cold in here.

I'm freezing.

Heather, don't.

<i>What's that up there?</i>

<i>It's a terrible place,
a place filled with sickness and suffering.</i>

<i>Never go there.</i>

<i>Do you hear me? Never!</i>

I've been here before.

<i>I know you're watching me, Richie.</i>

<i>Still thinking of little Heather now?</i>

<i>I'm better now.</i>

<i>You can touch me, Mommy.</i>

<i>You can touch me now.</i>

What was that?

<i>Not what, Tori, who? Who was that?</i>

There's gotta be a way out of here.

I mean, someone will come and get us,
right?

Richie said five hours.

Yeah, and he also said five floors.

Watch out!

What is with you?

This is where she died.

Who died?

Listen, there's a way out.

Do you smell that?

<i>Someone's making breakfast.</i>

<i>I don't smell anything.</i>

Pancakes and syrup.

Oh, Annie, they're making sweet potato pie!

Can't you hear the train?

They're coming for the bodies.

Oh, no!

Ashley!

Oh, Annie, can't you hear the train?

Why did you call me that?

Where were you just now?

Silly...

I was with you.

Who are you?

You're hurting me!

Why did they keep us together, Tori?

They said we'd all be on separate floors!

Who's on the fifth floor?

Come on, let's find out.

Tori.

Come on.

Come on!

Ashley?

Devon!

Where is everybody?

Ashley?

Where are you guys?

Devon.

Guys, where are you?

Oh, my God.

Tori, please.

It's okay.

Tori, don't.

It's okay.

Tori, we don't know what's in there.

See, Heather,
you are such a spaz sometimes.

Tori!

Heather, help me!

I don't wanna die.

Ashley!

Elizabeth!

Oh, my God.

Open the door!

You've gotta come here!

<i>We know everything.</i>

<i>How could you let them all die?</i>

<i>They came to you for help!</i>

<i>And so I helped them
by giving them a quick, easy death...</i>

<i>instead of the slow, agonizing decay
of disease.</i>

It's just a ball.

Devon?

<i>Five floors...</i>

<i>five girls...</i>

<i>five hours.</i>

Tori.

What's happening?

<i>They're not infected!</i>

<i>Not infected.</i>

<i>Can't you hear the train?</i>

<i>I'm coming for the bodies.</i>

<i>Five floors...</i>

<i>four girls...</i>

<i>four hours.</i>

<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

<i>Tori!</i>

Help me.

So cold.

<i>Nothing more than a two-bit whore.</i>

<i>How could you? I loved you!</i>

<i>You're infected.</i>

<i>But curable.</i>

<i>Your baby is crying.</i>

Tori!

<i>I was doing the community a great service.</i>

<i>The removal of undesirables.
Getting rid of the infected.</i>

<i>Your baby is crying.</i>

Stop!

<i>How could you kill your baby?</i>

<i>How could you kill our baby?</i>

Stop!

I'm gonna keep it.

R-J-V.

Oh, my God! That's them.

<i>Rock-a-bye, baby, in the treetop</i>

<i>When the wind blows, the cradle will rock</i>

<i>When the bough breaks</i>

<i>he cradle will fall</i>

<i>And down will come baby</i>

<i>Cradle and all</i>

Tori! Ashley!

Richie!

Heather!

Ashley!

Heather!

Heather!

Tori?

Is that you?

Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

I'm so sorry, Richard.

I didn't mean it.

I just want it to be...

how it used to be.

Help me get rid of it.

I just want it to be...

how it was.

Well, listen, all right,
everything is gonna be fine.

But we gotta go find the others,
and we need to get out of here.

We need to get you to a doctor...

No!

You're the one
who's always taken care of me.

Don't take that away as well.

I just want you to love me...

the way you used to.

Where are you going?
We ain't got time for this shit.

We got to get the...

Kill our baby!

Ashley!

Heather.

Where is everybody?

Oh, my God. Devon.

Devon, come on up.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, my God.

<i>Five floors...</i>

<i>three girls...</i>

<i>three hours.</i>

Heather.

Heather?

No. It's not your precious Heather.

It's me, remember? Your fucking girlfriend!

What happened to you?

Get the fuck off of me!

You had your chance and you blew it!

Ashley!

<i>Ashley!</i>

<i>Devon's dead.</i>

Come on, now,
we gotta go get the other girls.

Okay? All right?

They're dead.
Heather?

What's with the ax?

They're all dead.

What are you saying?
They're dead.

What part of "dead"
don't you fucking understand?

And she killed them!

Heather, give me the ax.

Give me the ax.
Don't be a fool.

Give... Give me that!

Ashley?

Don't listen to her, Richie. She killed them!

I don't know what's going on.

She killed them, Richie.
She's a goddamn fucking psycho!

I didn't kill anyone.

Look, this isn't a coincidence...

why we're all here.

There's something that this place wants.

Something that it needs us to know.

What the fuck is that?

<i>My mother gave me one like this...</i>

when I was little.

Just like this.

It was my grandmother's,
and she was very ill with a disease.

If you were infected...

you had to wear one of these.

This was around Elizabeth's neck.

These are the initials of that place.

Don't you get it?

We're in that hospital!

This is really...

I know it sounds crazy.

We all have a link to this place!

We're all related to someone who was here.

This is fucked up.

Come on, Richie,
you're not buying into this shit, are you?

The initials stand
for Richard James Vangard.

I guess you could say that...

my grandfather was the lunatic
that used to run this place.

You happy? Now you know.

Oh, well, bravo! My compliments!
Ashley, come on.

You guys win!

You've both succeeded in freaking me out!

Ashley, stop. Leave her alone.

Listen, bitch.

You and Richie...

and both of your fucked up families
might belong here...

but Richie is mine,
and I'm not letting him go.

Not even over...

my own dead fucking body.

I'm out of here.

Ashley, don't...
Fuck you!

What the fuck is it?

Come on!

Come on. Get down.

Don't breathe.

Don't move.

He's going away.

Where's the flashlight?
It's right there.

Richie.

What?
Listen.

It's the records room.

Read that?

"Vangard Sanatorium opens to aid
widespread epidemic."

"White Death claims more lives!"

More than 60,000 lives in this county alone.

"Sanatorium unable to cope
with excessive death rate."

"Underground tunnel to be built
for use as body chute."

"A 500-foot tunnel...

"will be built to aid removal
of infected diseased patients."

"Vangard, madman or genius?"

"Dr. Richard James Vangard
was accused before a grand jury...

"of using an underground body chute...

"to hide the death rate
of his hospital's patients...

"claiming they were released
from the hospital cured.

"He was also charged
with using the research grants...

"to support his lavish lifestyle."

You knew about this?

You knew all along,
and you still brought us here?

How could you do that?

Look, no one was supposed to get hurt.
This was just a setup.

We'd scare people away
from possibly attaching...

wrongful death suits
for their family members.

And as for all this shit,
this was all Ashley's idea.

I had nothing to do with this.
Not a goddamn thing!

Her family owns this place, this hospital,
everything, and it's worth millions.

I had nothing to do with this.

Ashley was in on this the whole time?

But why?

Because that sick, fucking,
piece of shit grandfather of mine...

had an affair with the head nurse,
Ashley's grandmother.

And the two of them concocted
this whole scheme.

There was stealing all the grant money,
all the research money, everything.

Lying about this fucking place
curing people.

They were all dying.

How could they do that?

How could you do that?

I don't know! I'm nothing like him!
I'm nothing like him!

I have nothing to do with this!

Man, I'm glad this scandal
ruined that sick old man!

One of the nurses...

she contracted the disease
and she hung herself, all right?

<i>But she didn't die.</i>

Her best friend came in and finished the job.

And the other one...

The other one what?

The other one died
from electrocution. Fuck.

<i>Ashley?</i>

Oh, my God.

Something in this place remembers...

and it's fucking pissed off.

We're reliving its past.

<i>Remember, five floors...</i>

<i>two girls...</i>

<i>two hours.</i>

This isn't happening to me.

We're not going to get out of here.

<i>I wonder why I ever picked
a loser like you anyhow.</i>

<i>You walk around pretending
like you're something special.</i>

<i>But inside...</i>

<i>you're just like the rest of those...</i>

<i>incurable people.</i>

"A little girl found frozen to death."

Elizabeth.

"More tragedy linked
to Vangard Sanatorium.

"Tracia Willis, a nurse stationed
on the fifth floor from Mills, Kentucky...

"jumped off the roof to her death.

"She had been severely depressed
about being pregnant out of wedlock."

Help me get rid of it.

<i>This is where she died.</i>

Who died?

Oh, God.
Tori!

<i>I neither have the strength nor heart...</i>

<i>to say the things I'd like you to know.</i>

<i>Either I go where there's peace...</i>

<i>or else I get better.</i>

Enough.

Tori!

Tori!

Tori!

<i>We're live, via satellite, from hell.</i>

<i>I have lost everything.</i>

<i>Hope for our children.</i>

<i>I cannot bear the guilt.</i>

<i>I cannot bear this child.</i>

<i>I hope you're listening when I'm gone.</i>

Tori!

Oh, my God, don't do it! Don't do it!

Don't, Tori!

Come here.

Richard, I knew you'd come.

You still love me.

I love you so much.

I swear to God, everything's gonna be
just how it was. I promise.

But you got to step away from there.

I killed my baby.

It's okay. It's okay.

I love you, all right?

Now you just step away from there.
Just come to me.

That's it. Just come to me.

That's it.

<i>Five floors...</i>

<i>one girl...</i>

<i>one hour.</i>

There's no way out.

We know everything.

How could you let them all die?

By giving them a quick, easy death...

instead of the slow, agonizing decay
of disease.

Oh, I have always hated the weak.

They feed off the strong and the healthy.

They drain us of everything
until we are just like them.

Weak, pathetic invalids!

That's pretty selfish of them,
don't you think?

You're sick!

Oh, I'm afraid you're mistaken, my dear.

You're the one who's sick.

Can't you feel it?

Choking you from inside.

Squeezing the blood up into your brain
until it explodes.

Stop it! Leave her alone!

I'm disappointed in my own flesh and blood.

Infected by the plague of a conscience.

You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

I'm nothing like you!

You're both amongst the frail
and the weak...

from a disease you all call love.

And you don't even know you're sick.

Well, let me assure you...

there's no way out.

Only death.

Where am I?

He must have knocked us out.

Heather.

Heather.

Heather.

Heather.

Train, we gotta go.

I don't feel good.

I'm sick.

We gotta get out of here, he's coming back.

I can't leave.

Yes, you can. Come on.

There's something wrong.

I'm freezing.

What are we gonna do?

I don't feel good.

Vangard said the only way out of here
was death.

The only way out of here
is the Death Tunnel.

Come on.

So many people have died here.

So many souls. And he just killed them.

The train, we gotta go.
No. I can't leave.

Yes, you can. Come on. It's almost over.

They need our help.

We can't save them!

I can't leave them.
Don't you wanna live?

You don't understand.

Someone has to make things right.

Richard. I can't do this.

We need to find a cure.

Find? There was no cure.

Go on without me.

You're coming with me.
We're getting out of here. Come on.

There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

Who are you?

<i>Here, I am God.</i>

<i>I am Life.</i>

<i>I am Death.</i>

Heather, you're not sick.

<i>You're infected.</i>

<i>No one is curable.</i>

You can't have her!

Heather?
You don't understand.

<i>We're all related to someone who was here.</i>

Come on.

<i>Five ghosts?</i>

Incurable people.

Richie, I can't leave.
Come on.

<i>We all have a link to this place!</i>

Listen to me, Richie. I belong here.

Who's on the fifth floor?

Don't you get it?

This is the last thing they saw
before they died!

Damn it! Come on!

Come on!

<i>A light at the end of a tunnel.</i>

<i>This is where she died.</i>

Who died?

Me.

Me.

Oh, Richie. Don't.

It's okay.

It's going to be all right.

It's contagious.
I don't care.

Just go.

Save yourself.

It's settled then.

Come on, we're gonna find the cure.
