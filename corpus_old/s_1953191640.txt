(birds chirping)

-( dog whines)
Come on.

Let's go.
Come on.

(woman chanting in Hindi)

Hey, "Buddha."

Love you, Lily.
Love you, too, Dad.


( horns honking )

( groans )
I already have to get up so early.

( Phone ringing )

Shut up.

(treadmill beeps)

-( ringing )
This is Ash. Leave me a message.

Hey, Ash. It's me.

I need to pick you up
15 minutes early

'cause I still gotta
do some prep

before our meeting
with Winchester.

Call me back.

( Reel whines, clicks)

Well, I don't think
we'll be eating her for breakfast.

Is that me?

Nice.
Very Rubenesque.

Miss Tisdale?
Remi's not painting right.

The sky is not green.

Oh.

Well, haven't you ever seen
a winter sunset on the lake

when the sky
turns silver-green?

No.

Well, that's too bad,

because it's one of the most
beautiful sights you'll ever see.

Right, Remi?

Ugh, come on, Ash.

(sirens blaring,
horns honking )

(woman groans)
Where are you?

The fact that they're
involved in litigation

means great clients for us.

I'm persuaded.

No worries, you're fine.

They just started
about 10 minutes ago.

Receptionist:
Coffee, Ms. Tisdale?

I have your contracts,
depositions, profiles,

and your notes.

Rapture's bringing in huge revenues.
Approved.

On your recommendation.

Just make sure
they're well vetted.

Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up--

Ash.
You're already here.

Now that we're all here,
can we get started?

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, baby, that's breakfast!

-( Dog barking )
Beautiful.

( Gas hisses )

(dog whimpering )

What are you doing?
What? What?

Do you want to play?
You wanna play?

Get it!

-( Dog barking )
Get it!

( Hissing continues)

Ms. Tisdale:
I can tell you exactly.

Page 13, paragraph 42D.

Yes.
"Pursuant to indemnity,

purchaser shall place
in escrow--"

I'm gonna have to
call you back, Counselor.

I waited for you
for 20 minutes.

I took a cab early.
I called, I texted--

I left my phone in the office.

If you had moved in with me
like we talked about, you'd know.

Don't even go there, Ash.
Right after you left,

Winchester
chewed me out good.

Well, you do look
good enough to eat.

Don't let them bully you.

If you're not the predator,
you're the prey.

Yeah, easy for you to say.
You just made partner.

You're on your way.

Don't be pissed at me.
I remembered your dress.

I asked you to bring
the green one.

But I love this one on you.
And it's my party.

Well, if you love it so much,

then why don't you
just wear it?

Ahem--!

Winny.

Take it easy on my girl.

See you at 7:00?
Wouldn't miss it.

Tisdale.

You have to be our face
on the merger.

I'd rather have a partner lead,

but you have the best rapport
with United Textiles.

Of course.
I'd be honored, sir.

Familiarize yourself
with their share exchange ratios

and employee contracts.

My office, noon?
We'll work through lunch.

I'll be there. Thank you.

Jeanne?

"Rapture Real Estate"-
who sent this?

It says, "Call me."
Do you want me to call?

-( Can lid pops)
Sugar free?

Of course.
I love you, Jeanne.

That dog never quits.

-( Loud blast)
-( Lily gasps)

( laughter )

That's okay, Remi.

Woman on intercom:
Miss Tisdale?

Not now. I've got to be in
Winchester's office in two minutes.

It's your sister.
She says it's urgent.

Lily. I actually can't talk
right now.

I'm right in the mi--

ls-.

Are you joking?

( Sighs )
I'm not going.

Sara...

he was your dad.

I'm already on thin ice
with Winchester and--

I'll manage him.

He lied to all of us and Mom
still thinks he's God's gift.

Sara.
Come on, come on.

You have to go.

Only if you're by my side.

I can't face them
without you.

The firm can't
lose us both right now.


United Textiles will just have to

interface with me.

Sara?

My proposal still stands.

You can turn me down
as much as you like.

I'm still here.

Call me, okay?

You're so beautiful.

â™ª Well, I was walking
to the water â™ª

â™ª To wash away some sin â™ª

â™ª So much for walking â™ª

â™ª I think I'll jump right in... â™ª

Tell Winchester that I brought
the depositions with me.

I'm totally on top of it.
I can work from here and--

-( line clicks)
Jeanne?

Jeanne...?

Uh-hh. Is it still string and tin cans
around here?

Dad?

Dad?

Man:
Miss? Miss?

Yo, miss?
Oh--

Am I on the right road for the
Booker T. Washington Memorial?

Oh, I don't--

I don't live here.
Sorry.

I'm Tim Ernandes on your
hometown radio station

at Smith Mountain Lake,
Lake Radio 330 WSLK.

We have a report
about a new sighting

by the Smithy Lake Monster
Research Society.

Stay tuned.
We'll bring you the details.

Cute.
.' I need a highway from home .'

â™ª The road I love to roam â™ª

â™ª I need a highway
from home â™ª

â™ª It's a road
they're building â™ª

â™ª That's in the air â™ª

â™ª On my own. â™ª

Sara, you came.

You look, uh, like crap.

Thanks, Lily.
So do you.

Besides, you like snakes.

Yeah, well,
you like boys.

Hey, no boy?
Where's your swank L.A. lawyer?

Oh, uh--
he had to work.

Huh.
Sounds like a putz.

You just sounded
like Dad.

Where's--
Come on.

Mommy?

Thought you'd
never get here.

I had to fly into Greensboro.
It was a two-hour drive.

Wish you could've come here
the summer I invited you.

I guess you won.
Won?

Whatever cruel game
you were playing with your father.

Now you don't have to see him after all.
Mom.

She didn't mean that.

( Sighs )
'Course, he didn't know I'd need them.

Need what, Mama?
Keys to the shed.

We mow on Monday.
Someone's got to mow the grass.

So you can hire a gardener.

Mom: Dave Boyers
at the bank might know.

About our shed?
No, where those papers were.

Your father's papers.
What papers?

His passport? Stocks?
Sara.

Give her a chance.
This is something that I can handle.

I did go to law school.
And you never came back.

Lily? We're gonna need
some food for the reception.

Yeah, I'll go to Tinnell's
and order.

No, I can go.
I have to pick up some things.

Mom, I've got it.
No.

You've already paid
for a plane ticket, a rental car.

Lord knows
when we'll ever see you again.

I also need some ketchup.

I shouldn't have come.

Then why did you?

'Cause you'd never forgive me
if I didn't.

Sara, she won't admit it,
but she's--

-( phone ringing )
Oh.

I have to take this.
I'm sorry.

There you are.

Have you sent the orals?
Jeanne: Of course.

Also, I need you
to do me a favor

and move my flight up.

Man: You married, huh?
Sara: No.

Boyfriend?
Yes.

Dang.

'Cause my grandson's 26.
He'd be perfect for you.

These platters will be ready
first thing tomorrow, right?

Okay, I get it, hon'.

Just-- just take this receipt
to the register.

That's all right, I understand
you're very busy. I just-

they're for my dad's funeral.
He decided to blow himself up.

Oh-- Ray
was your daddy, huh?

Sorry.

Anything I can help
you with, I'm Vic.

Anything at all you need,
you let me know.

Thanks, Vic.
Mm-hmm.

Oh, ketchup.

It's two aisles over yonder.

You wouldn't happen to have
any sugar-free Red Bull, would you?

Red what?
Might try the candy aisle.

Mrs. Tinnell.

How can I help you, Jim?

Flyers for the wine festival.

Ainsley-- well, hello there.

Jim McCarren, chairman
of the Wine Festival Committee.

I'm running
for re-election next year-

I don't live here.
Yes.

Ainsley...
Mrs. Tinnell: Can I help you, darling?

Hey, we're gonna miss you
at the meeting, Old Vic.

Hey, why it gotta be
"Old Vic"?

Whatever happened to "Big Vic"?
You got old.

Umph.

With the platters,
that'll be $46.74.

Oh, my God.

Well, just give me 40, then.
That's fine.

Oh, no, no, no.
It's just so cheap-

in L.A., that would be
like 200 bucks.

In L.A., they should just go
to "Brangelina's" house

and borrow some ketchup.

Mrs. Tinnell:
Wait-- Sara Tisdale?

Goodness!

I'm so sorry about Ray.
Thank you.

Ooh, sorry.
We're huggers around here.

Don't you worry
about the platters.

Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, no, no, no.

Your daddy was
a good customer here

since before you could walk.

And a good friend.

You tell your mama and Lily
we're thinking about them, okay?

I will. Thank you.

My. my, my.

â™ª Tarpaper simmers
under your feet â™ª

â™ª Your confession box
lies there... â™ª

A map would've been nice, Ray.

â™ª Shut up and listen
one time â™ª

â™ª Like you never seen â™ª

â™ª But you know why â™ª

â™ª You know why â™ª

â™ª Whoo-ooh â™ª

â™ª Don't leave me now â™ª

â™ª Don't care anyhow... â™ª

I knew it, Ray.

â™ª Whoo-ooh... â™ª

Rapture Realty?

â™ª Don't leave me now â™ª

â™ª Don't care anyhow. â™ª

Man: We solemnly swear to prove
the existence of "Smithy,"

the ancient creature
living at Smith Mountain Lake.

Group:
We do.

Sorry I'm late, boys.
Man #2: Hey, Carl.

Are we ready to do this?
Yes, sir.

Let's do it.
Okay, okay.

The Smithy Research Society
will hereby come to order.

First order of business-

a moment of silence for Ray.

By the way,
I ran into Ray's daughter at Tinnell's.

All:
Ooh--!

You wanna marry her.
No, no, not Lily.

The other one,
the attorney from L.A.

Sara?
Oh.

Okay, next order
of business.

What did we learn
from our last stakeout?

Larry?
No Mallomars.

They melted
all over my backpack.

Carl:
Okay, boys. New business.

The Smithy Research
Society now has...

night vision.

( laughs )
Oh, wow.

He can hide from us
no more.

That's very true.
Man: Ooh, Larry.

I can see your chakras.

Well, get 'em off me.

Bob: Hey, you guys
see Futterman's show last night?

Larry: Of course.
Russell: Yeah, buddy.

Carl: Hey, you know what?
We should get Futterman to come here.

Vic: Mark Futterman ain't gonna
come to Smith Mountain Lake.

He goes for big-name stuff.

Bob: Yeah, like that episode
on Bigfoot they found in Malaysia.

No, no, Bob, that's stupid
because Bigfoot ain't real.

I know Bigfoot's not real, Carl.

Vic:
I think Bigfoot killed Kennedy.

Ash? Ash?

Oh, my God, Ash.
I can actually almost hear you.

How's it going?

This is way more stressful
than I thought it was gonna be.

I just-- I wish
that you were here.

. L..
-( phone line clicks)

Ash? Ash?

Oh, this is so cool.

What do you see?
What is it?

I think I see Sara.

Vic: Hey, are you looking
for Smithy or Lily?

Man:
What are you doing?

( Yells )
Argh! Hey!

Hey there, Tyler.

It's just the, uh,
Smithy Research Society.

We're on a stakeout.

Ain't gonna find Smithy
up there, boys.

Just remember,
the water's this way.

Absolutely.
Yes, sir.

We did know that.
Thank you.

Thank you
for protecting and serving.

Have a good night.
Namaste.

( Groans )
I keep getting disconnected.

Why don't you stop torturing us all
and use the house phone?

Because the bill
would be astronomical

and you won't let me
give you money.

Dear Lord,
bless this food for our use

and thank you
for bringing Sara back.

Please take good care of Ray.

Amen.

Still dating that Ashland?

Ash, yes.

What is it,
three years now?

Since I graduated
law school.

And he still
hasn't proposed?

Actually, he has.

Twice.

Can't be serious if he won't even
come to your father's funeral.

I mean, what kind of a man
is that?

Can we not
talk about Ash, then?

Ahem.

So, how's work?
Great, actually.

Our biggest client
loves me.

They want me to be
lead chair on a huge merger,

which should
help me make partner.

Well, you always were
ambitious.

Is that a backhanded compliment?
No, it's just a statement.

You're ambitious.

Aren't you the one
who always encouraged us

to go out in the world
and make something of our lives

instead of sitting around
with a husband who's always gone

doing who the hell
knows what?

( Door closes )

Jesus, Sara.

The only thing
I came here to say

I guarantee you
she won't hear.

Well, you're the lawyer.
Ever think of the way you're saying it?

Come on, Lily.
Don't give me grief, too.

I can't handle it
from both of you.

All right, then.

Come on.
I know what you need.

â™ª I made a fool of myself â™ª

â™ª I made a fool of myself â™ª

â™ª It didn't seem
to matter anyway â™ª

â™ª It's cold outside,
but it felt like sunshine â™ª

â™ª When she looked down
on me... â™ª

Wow.
( laughs )

Nothing's changed, huh?

Yeah, it's part of its charm.

Hey, Lily.
Hey, Irene.

Do you know my sister Sara?

Honey, I heard
you were in town.

Really? How'd you know?
I just got here.

Hey, I am so sorry
to hear about your dad.

You two need anything,
it's on me tonight.

You back in town to stay?
No.

I mean, I'm just here
for the funeral.

Ainsley:
.' You are, you are... .'

Poor Ainsley needs a man.

â™ª You are, you are... â™ª

Every week, that girl
plays groupie to the band.

Everybody knows
her name, huh?

I'd shrivel up and cry.

Not when we were kids.
You would've knocked out the lead singer

and stole the microphone.

Sara, you can be
real proud of your sister.

When my boy Remi
first got sick,

Lily was my..

Thanks, Irene.
Remi's doing real well in class.

My little Picasso.

You two need anything,
you just holler.

Anybody here you don't know?

You, for starters.
You never told me Ash proposed.

â™ª There's a storm
that's brewing outside tonight... â™ª

You know,

I don't think Mom and Dad
were ever the same after you left.

I think you broke his heart.
He broke mine first.

Is that why you took off?

Hey, people grow up.
They move on.

I needed to move on.
Oh, please.

If you start singing "Circle of Life,"
I swear I will slap you.

Answer my question.

Dad was everything good
about this place.

Getting up early
to look for deer

and Sunday barbecues

and even his
frickin' "BFL."

You're the one who started calling
Smithy the "BFL."

Yeah, well, I learned
I can't trust any of that.

He was cheating on Mom.
You're full of crap.

With someone named Betty.
Sara, stop.

I found the letters in the attic.
Dad is gone!

You better figure out if you're gonna be
poison around here or a cure.

Find your own way home.

Lils-- wait, Lils!

Lils!

I think I might need
a ride home, Irene.

Honey, I gotta be here
'til 2:00.

I can take her.

Thanks, hon'. But we need somebody
that knows his way around.

I have the perfect solution.

Tyler Humphries?

Hey, Sara.

You look great.
You look different.

Yep.
Got contacts.

Tyler, you think Sara
can bum a ride home with you?

Yeah, sure.
Anything I can do to help.

Keep the change, Irene.

I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

We used to go fishing
together all the time.

Thanks.

( Owl hooting )

Hear that?

Get the horned owl
this time of year.

Oh.
Well, thanks for the ride.

Will I see you again?
Tomorrow.

At the funeral.
Oh, yeah.

Okay, good night.
Night.

Mom?
Why don't you go to bed?

I'm just gonna
sit here for a bit.

Bed's so big
for one person.

Your dad proposed to me
on a Friday.

Gave me
a single pink rose.

He knew I loved roses,
but he couldn't afford a whole dozen.

Every Friday for 34 years,

no matter where he was,

he made sure I got my rose.

Pastor: We are here today
to celebrate a life.

To pay our final respects
to our friend,

our husband, our father,
Ray Tisdale.

Ray loved this lake.

Ray and I spoke many times
about his belief

-( woman sobbing )
that appreciating the majesty of this lake

was, for him,
giving glory to God.

You know,
Ray did not frequently...

Who's that bawling
back there?

I don't know. I feel like
my head's gonna explode.

( Phone ringing )

Figures.
Finally get service.

-( Phone clicks)
Sorry, Ash.

This is where Ray wanted us,
the people he loved, to gather.

And so we bid Ray farewell,

evoking the spirit
of his Saxon forebearers.

(whispering )

I've changed my mind.

Uh-- listen.

It's what he wanted,
Vivian, you know.

I know. But given
the circumstances of his death,

I'm sure you'd agree
that this is not appropriate.

Uh, this lake was
a big part of Ray,

and now he's gonna
become part of it.

Pastor: Ray did want us
to celebrate, Viv.

I know.
You're right.

Come on.

You must be
tickled pink, Ray.

( Rock music playing )

He's not in there, is he?

No.

â™ª Smoke on the water â™ª

â™ª A fire in the sky â™ª

â™ª Smoke on the water... â™ª

( Music continues)

Vic: Did you know
something, though?

I wish I would've brought
a flask of 'shine

just to stick
right in this coffee.

( laughing )
Hi, honey, how you doing?

I don't think he'd mind
if we were having a good time.

Mm-hmm.
You want a muffin, Vic?

Thank you very much, yeah.
Sure.

Carl?
You holding up all right, sweet pea?

My deepest condolences.
Thank you.

Have you seen Sara?
Yeah, she's...

Pay my respects?
...out on the deck.

Thank you.

That's the only way
to send a guy like your dad out.

Oh, Tyler. Hey.

I didn't see you
at the service.

It was my boat
that put out the fire.

He was a great man.

Taught me a lot
while I was in prison.

I'm out on
work release now.

I'm kidding.

I run marine patrol.
Oh.

And you seem underwhelmed.

Of course, my gigolo business
does pretty well.

Summer renters, mostly.

Elderly and lonely.
Oh.

But horny.
Stop.

They're saggy.
Gross.

Gassy.
You are evil.

( Sputters )

( man coughs)

Sara? Years back,
when you took off--

Yeah, I gotta take off now.

Out already?

Anything I can do?
No, it's been great seeing you,

but my flight takes off
in a few hours.

Sara?

Sara!
You can't leave!

I have a huge case.

You can't abandon me
with this.

Come on, Lily.
Give me those keys.

Can't you think about someone
other than yourself for one minute?

Damn it, Lily.
I have to go.

Fine, just run away again.
You're mad at Dad, so I lose a sister.

That's not fair.
Fair? You're gonna go back

to your L.A. life
and your cush job.

I'm stuck here
taking care of Mom.

Whatever he did, just-

don't take it out on us.

Help me.

Thank God
for the old moonshiners.

Thank you, girls,
for humoring your old mother.

I just got tired of cleaning up.
Sara: Yeah, right.

Little Lily, here.
You're drunk enough for all of us.

Hair of the dog, baby.

I got only two days
to get in shape for the festival.

He's gone.

He loved you girls so much.

Freshman year,

I got a message
from dorm security

that I had a whole bunch
of flowers,

and I got all excited, like,
"Oh, who are these from?"

They were from Dad,
of course.

You didn't thank him.

That hurt.

It's not that simple, it's--

Dad was-

There were things about him
you didn't know.

Did you know
this was his dream?

He wanted to raise his sons
hunting and fishing

and then you two girls
came along.

Think there's
a thunderstorm coming.

Oh, I miss those in L.A.
( thunder rumbles)

I think we'd best
go back inside.

Here, I got that.

Vivian: The thing is,
it's a dry heat.

Huh?

Arizona, that's what they say.
It's a dry heat.

And I think it'll go quickly.

What'll go?
The house.

You're gonna burn
the house down?

I mean, this could be a tear-down.
Huh?

They buy 'em and tear 'em down--
I know what a tear-down is

but I don't want
our house to be one.

Then I need $117,000.

So, if you don't have
that kind of money layin' around,

I think that the condo
is very reasonable.

What condo?
What condo?

Rancho Del Monte.

I liked it right off 'cause
I used to use their tomato paste-

not too acidy.

You can't sell this house.

What am I gonna do
rattling around here all by myself?

Hello?
I still live here.

Honey, you just
made it quite clear

that you need
to go off to art school.

Am I the only one
that doesn't get to leave this place?

This is crazy.

And Sara, don't you make me
wait to see you again.

Arizona's right next to California,
last time I checked.

What are we gonna do?
She already got an agent.

( Splashing )

Dad?

I didn't think you'd have
the guts to face me.

Remember when you were little
and you tried to row this boat

all the way across the lake
by yourself?

You had to rescue me.

You were only seven and you already
knew that you could do anything.

'Course, you were too small
to use the oars,

but the wind was blowing.

Before we could figure out
where you'd gone,

you were three,
four hundred yards out.

That scared the living daylights
out of me.

I jumped in the water,
swam out there,

and you were having a grand old time
watching me splash around,

trying to climb into the boat.

It wasn't so grand
when we capsized.

That's true.
I thought Smithy'd get us.

You had to put me on your back
and swim me to shore,

and you squeezed me
for like 15 minutes.

It's good to see you, sunshine.
Yeah, how am I--

Seeing me?
Yeah.

How cool is this?

What the hell happened?

It was an accident.
And trust me,

nobody tries to have
an accident like that.

I even lost my damn hat.

I'm hungry-

I used to love to eat.
Mm-hmm.

Always with your mouth
wide open.

You all hated that,
didn't you?

My three sophisticated ladies
of the lake?

Three, huh?

Is that all?

No other special lady
at your funeral?

You're not gonna let that go, are you?
What about Mom?

All those years
that you lied to her?

Like a rose every Friday
makes up the difference.

Well, sunshine, I can see
you're no romantic.

I want to go home.

Take me back.

The Willards.
They brought you pancakes

with chocolate chips
and peanut butter.

Oh, Mom.
I can't eat that.

But it's your favorite.

Yeah, when I was like, eight.

(birds chirping)

New painting technique?

It helps me organize my mind sol
can be open to the gifts of the universe.

( Sighs )
So what are you painting?

Nice.
Very minimalist.

Ha-ha.

It was for Dad.

He wanted me to capture
this view of the lake.

My first and only
commission.

I kept putting him off
and putting him off

and, well,
there's no hurry now.

Lily, this is who you are.

( Scoffs )
I know who I am.

I'm a small-town art teacher
who paints cities she'll never visit.

I never even made it
to Chicago.

I should've burned my portfolio
when I had the chance.

What?

I got the gas can from the shed
and Dad stopped me.

He said it'd be a shame to waste
the canvases, so he took them down

to the church's
Joyous Junk Sale and--

I guess they got what they deserved,
all painted over by amateurs.

I thought you liked
being a teacher.

I do, I--
I love the kids,

but watching 10-year-olds
draw robots and me,

and me as a robot, it's not exactly
how I pictured my life,

you know?

I'm all in my head.

I've gotta just get my Kundalini flowing
and open up my heart chakra.

"Under heaven,
all can see beauty

only because
there is ugliness."

If you ever quit teaching,

you could start writing

"You will soon be leaning over a bar
with several old friends..."

Both:
"In bed."

( phone ringing )

Hello?

Man on phone: Is this Carl Burger?
Speaking.

Yeah, you sent me
63 e-mails.

This is Mark Futterman,
with The Exploratory Channel.

M-Mark Futterman?

Oh, my God.
Sir, we love you.

Well, we're in scramble mode
because of a cancellation.

But I'd like to bring a crew out there
and do an episode on Smithy.

For real?
That would be awesome!

Why didn't you tell me, Ray?

We don't have the money
to pay these people.

You promised we were gonna
grow old here together.

And now you just left me
here alone.

Ray:
Darlin', after 34 years together,

does it feel like you're alone?

No.

No, maybe that's the problem.

You're everywhere.

Our books, our bed.

You even built this shed.

You were always my home.
This was the girls' home.

If you're leaving
'cause you think you have to,

well, the girls can help.

The girls.

Lily feels stuck here
taking care of me

and Sara just wants to take
the first plane out of here.

( Door opens )

Mom?

Mom, why are you selling
the house?

I don't have a choice.

Rapture Real Estate.
Why do I know that name?

Apparently, they have
the deeds to the house.

You have two weeks to pay
or you're gonna have to be evicted?

Mom, this letter
is dated 10 days ago.

Why didn't you come to me
with this earlier?

I didn't know about it.

But I thought that Dad paid off
the mortgage when we were kids.

One day, Ray comes in,
he just says,

"Go for it, darling.

Build the kitchen
of your dreams."

So he refinanced.
Yeah,

with Dave Boyers
down at the bank.

I never heard word one
about these Rapture people.

If I don't sell the house
and pay these people, I'm--

I'm gonna end up
with nothing.

Mom, I'm gonna figure this out.

Hello?
Jeanne?

Sara, where the heck
are you?

United Textiles' rep
will be here in an hour.

Oh, I tried to call you
but I don't have any cell phone service.

I missed my flight.
Let me see how quickly I can re-book.

I'm actually not coming back
right now.

Winchester's on a rampage.
He needs you at the briefing.

Ash can cover for me.

Look, there was a card on my desk
that said "Rapture Real Estate."

Give me those details
as soon as you can, okay?

Okay.
Thank you, Jeanne. You're the best.

Oh, Dad.

How am I supposed
to find anything in this?

The She-Doos are still here.

I wonder what they wanted out of life
when they were my age.

( Motor starts )

(flock quacking )

How does Rapture fit in?

These guys
are all over the lake.

Sara, here's one more
probate file.

Oh, thank you so much.

Great blouse. My favorite color.
Thank you.

Sara?

Oh, Tyler.

What are you doing here?
I thought you left town.

I'm trying to establish chain of title
for my dad's estate.

You seem stressed.

You wanna grab
some lunch?

I have a boyfriend.
Yeah, well, he'll have to buy his own.

Let me drop off my dock permit.
Give me two seconds.

Don't go anywhere.

So why in the world
are you doing marine patrol

here at
Smith Mountain Lake?

Well, I love issuing
fishing citations.

But the bullhorn.
That was the real sell.

Seriously?
There's something magic about this lake.

Don't want to be
anywhere else.

Now, you said
you'd never leave.

And then, just as we were
about to get serious-

You went off to school.
Well, I wrote. I called.

L-- I needed
a change of pace.

I have a confession to make.

I saw you the other night

trying to throw yourself
off the dock.

Trying to get frickin'
cell phone reception.

Well, you gave quite a show
to some locals looking out for the BFL.

Hey, they deserve to see
something, at least.

( laughs )
That's the Sara I remember.

Y'all know
what you'd like?

Uh, yeah. I will have
a pulled pork sandwich,

iced tea, and some
onion rings, please.

For you, hon'?

Side salad
and water with lemon.

Bottled.
All right.

So, how's your mom?
Holding up?

She-.

She wants to sell the house
and move to Arizona.

Well, it is a dry heat
out there.

Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

There ya go.

I'm sorry,
I have to go.

Well, now I know
how you stay so slim.

You don't eat a damn thing.

Let me make you
dinner sometime.

Tyler...

I'm just here to settle
my father's estate.

Larry.

Nice to meet you, Larry.

Russell, with an L.
With an L. Duly noted.

Hi, I'm Bob.

Can I get your autograph?
Yeah, I'll make sure that happens.

Say, um, Mr. Futterman,
if I may.

Why is it that you sound
so different in real life

than you do on the TV?

For the show,
I like to use the dialect

so that the viewers actually
think it's one of their own

telling them a story.
You understand?

It's Hollywood.

So, look, what I'm gonna do
is flush out some interviews,

mix it with some actors,
some CGI.

For example,
if you hit "Enter" on the computer,

you're gonna see footage
of the project we did on "Cressie."

Shot it up in Newfoundland.

As you can see
from the footage,

we got tons of monsters
on green screen.

We can augment that
with shots of your lake.

We can put the creature
anywhere we want.

How do you know
what he looks like?

Doesn't matter
what he looks like.

Not gonna get any footage
of the creature. Come on.

( laughs )
That's why we do reenactments.

Come on, fellas.

It's not radio. We gotta show them
something visual.

Okay.

Say, me and the boys are gonna go
get a drink down the road.

Would you like to join us?

No.
No, I'll skip that.

Yeah.

( Music playing )

Sara: I don't remember
the last time I had this much to drink.

I love Jack Daniels.

It always feels a little zesty.

Guess what?
I had a lunch today with Tyler

You bad girl. How did that go?
No, no, no, no.

I found Betty.
What?

She's a waitress in town.
No.

Oh, yeah. How are you so sure
she really exists?

'Cause I have the letters.
I can show them--

I don't believe it.

This lake, this life,
it's not an illusion-- or delusion.

Listen to you. You talk about
how this place entraps you.

Why don't you come
out to L.A. with me?

Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
I'll leave Mom now.

That's nice.
Oh, man.

How long are you gonna
use Mom as an excuse?

"Okay, class. Let's get our
Kundalinis flowing in our chakras,

and I don't have to risk
taking a real critic."

Take that back.
Oh! Hey!

Oh, Carl,
I'm so sorry.

That's okay. Beer has spilled
on this shirt before.

And will again.
Like that, maybe.

( laughter )

Gee, thanks, Vic.
This was yours.

Hey, Carl. Heard you guys
meta big movie star today.

We sure did. Mr. Mark Futterman,
from Exploratory.

He's doing an exposÃ© on Smithy.
For real?

Guys:
For real.

Say, listen. You mind
if I bring him around?

Vic:
Yeah, you know, like,

show him where
the legend began.

Sure, my dad
would be so proud.

Cheers, guys.
All: Cheers.

Bye!

That was so nice of them
to give us a ride.

I know! So nice.
Oh, God.

They're always there.
I forgot about the stairs.

Lily: This is why
I never go to the gym.

So, uh, it must
be pretty weird

coming here after your
glamorous city living, huh?

Does he take you
to parties all the time?

He who?
He who? Lawyer boy.

Is he the one?
The one? I don't know.

Ash is-- he should be,
but, you know,

he's such a lawyer.

Why are you with him, then?

Uh-oh.

Ash is smart and funny and--

Ooh, wow. I got it.

Oh, stars.

You never see those in L.A.

I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

I didn't mean it.

Hell, it's true.

I'm a medium fish
in a small, small pond.

Well, a lake, really.

I'm safe, you know.

Safe and boring.

Oh, one thing
you will never be is boring.

Both:
"In bed."

Sara: Thank you for seeing me
so early, Mr. Boyers.

As you know, my father
refinanced with this bank,

but the chain of title says that Rapture
holds the papers to the house.

Your father came to see me
three years ago.

He wanted to use some equity
to pay for some upgrades.

A gift to Vivian.

So he re-mortgaged.

This area got hit very hard
by the recession.

Everybody was overleveraged.
A lot of people were missing payments.

Rapture, well...

Rapture claimed they would
treat this community like family.

So we sold
a group of loans

at an acceptable loss.

As mortgage-backed
securities.

And now they're calling
these loans.

As they have
the right to do so.

My mother doesn't have
that kind of money.

They're forcing her into short sale.
Sara, I'm sorry.

I can't make them
live up to their word.

If there's anything
I can do.

I'd gladly repair this
if I could.

Thank you.

Whoa, good morning.

I got the idea
to tell some folks

that you were looking
into Rapture Real Estate.

Mrs. Tinnell:
Hey, Sara.

I was just telling your mom that for us,
it started when Dale's foot injury

forced him to leave
the state police.

The bills were just piling up.

Mr. Boyers
couldn't help us any--

too risky.

And then Rapture just swooped in
and offered us a way out.

Irene:
Same thing with the bar.

I couldn't work 'cause I was with Remi
in the hospital, you know?

I had to take out
a second mortgage

to help pay
for the radiation therapy.

These people came to us
like they was guardian angels.

Rapture ain't no angel.
More like "Raptor Real Estate."

How'd you find these guys?

They put flyers
on the hospital bulletin board.

It didn't strike me at the time
how sick that is.

Fella came by
the electronics shop.

If something doesn't change soon,
I'm gonna have to sell--

just like you, Viv.

That's a lot of complaints
in one year.

( Phone ringing )

Thanks for calling me back.
Woman: Sure thing, Sara.

But I gotta tell you. We've looked
into Rapture before, hon'.

We never had enough
to build a case.

Sara: They're clearly
trying to manipulate the market.

Good luck to you, honey.
That's gonna be tough to prove.

Sara: At least let me bring you
what I've found.

All right. I can give you
10 minutes tomorrow at 5:00.

I'll be there.

( Phone ringing )

Hey, baby.

How's it going up there
on the mountain?

Been kidnapped
by the McCoy clan yet?

Don't say that.
You're always knocking those hillbillies.

They're my family.

People around here, they wave to you
when you drive by them.

They'll do anything
that you ask them to do,

and you really should see it.
Next time, baby.

We're totally swamped
on this merger.

When you get back,
we'll do it up.

Yamashiro.
That halibut carpaccio you love?

That's the one you love.

Then we'll go to a place
you like, okay?

Just hurry up
and get back here.

I have to deal with
Rapture Real Estate first.

Finally.

I didn't want you to mix
business with personal, but--

Yeah, they have so-called
clients all over the lake.

They buy failing loans off the bank,
jack up the interest,

and then force people
into short sales.

I'm convinced that I can
press criminal charges.

I'm going to meet
with the D.A. and--

Ash, are you there?
Uh, Sara, I-I'm here-

What do you mean
"criminal charges"?

Are you there?
Sara?

Damn.
-( phone beeps )

(saw whines)

Folks, I am here in the town

of Smith Mountain Lake,
Virginia.

Now, Carl, you say there's
an entire town under this lake.

A bunch of houses, anyway,
Mark Futterman.

Cemeteries, too.

Some folks didn't believe the water level
would get as high as it was marked.

Ended up having to leave
everything behind.

Carl Burger heads up
a local group,

the Smithy Research Society,

in search of a giant
plesiosaur known as "Smithy."

Now Carl, what can you tell me
about the beast?

Okay, first of all,
calm down, relax.

We're gonna cut it there,
we'll make this work.

When I ask you this question,
just relax, okay?

Okay.
Your note would be,

"More good, less suck."
Don't be nervous,

don't stare at the camera,
don't stare at me.

And stop saying my last name.
It makes you sound ridiculous.

Yes, sir.
All right? You good?

Ahem.

So, Carl, what can you tell me
about the beast?

Well, Mark Futterman,

"Smithy" was the name
that the old fisherman gave him.

It was our friend, Ray.
He named him Smithy.

We believe he may be hundreds
of years old and weigh over two tons.

Sounds like my mother-in-law.

You can cut that part out,
obviously.

-( Ceiling creaking)
Lily?

UP here!

Nice job tearing down
that sign-

what's going on?

He...

told me he took these
to the junk sale.

Oh...

I can't believe
you were gonna burn these.

Crazy.

Oh, Lils.

This is great.

Keep it.

What were you saying about being
"open to the gifts of the universe"?

Hello?
Yeah. Well, fine.

Let's go figure out
how to save the house.

You coming?

In a sec.
Okay.

Why'd you tell me
that story before?

Well, maybe it was to remind you
of a girl who wasn't afraid of anything.

I went to L.A. by myself.
Exactly.

By yourself.

Now you're tethered
to some man

who'll do anything he can
to keep you away

from all the people
that you really care about.

That's just speculation.
Well, excuse me, Your Honor.

Everybody's got their secrets.
You should know that.

What do you mean by that?
Betty?

She is one big step down
from Mom.

What'd she offer
you anyway, Dad?

Two-for-one specials?

I have the letters.
You were a teenager, Sara.

If it wasn't the letters, it'd have been
something else that made you upset.

Take me back.

Now.

You're way off base.
I know that you wrote those letters.

Yes, I did.
I wrote those letters.

Every one of them.

When you think you've got
everything figured out,

you might wanna just
look a little deeper.

( Echoing )
Look a little deeper.


One night.

Can't I just get
one night's sleep?

Vivian:
Hello.

Y'all here to see the house?
Oh.

Are you selling?

Moving to Arizona.
Oh, dear.

Well, it is a dry heat.

I'm so sorry to hear
about your husband.

I'm Dottie Price.

I own the gift shop
at Bridge-water Marina.

I think you know
Dee-Dee Bondurant.

I hope
you won't move.

Ladies wanna come up?
Both: Sure.

It's kinda old,
but this is what it is.

Boo!

You don't want this house!
This house is haunted.

Lily Tisdale!
I'm so sorry about that.

We didn't actually come to see the house.
Pffft.

No, we all wanted
to invite you

to join the She-Doos.

Oh, I'm not much
for jet skis.

We do a lot more than that
all around the lake.

For instance, one thing we're doing
is helping with the wine festival.

I don't know, I'm--

Dottie:
A lot of us are widows.

I lost Herbie six months
after we moved in.

Reaching out is so much better
than tucking in.

We'd love, if you could
spare the time,

to help us set up the art displays
at the festival.

That's good, that's good.
Thank you.

So, Mr. McCarren...

what is your take
on whether or not

the serpent
actually exists?

Well, as chairman
of the Wine Festival Committee,

I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
Sure.

But I really don't know
what you want me to say--

That's good, Ainsley.

My official position
is that Smithy exists.

My private position
is that he does not.

However,
my public position is

that folks here love
this sea serpent,

therefore so do I.
( chuckles )

So, when do we roll?

Oh, we've been rolling.

-( Crew laughing)
What? But I-- well, you can't--

I swear, if you idiots do anything
to mess up my wine festival,

I'll-- we're done here.

You've got to be
kidding me.

Go. You said "Full"
when I left.

Shocker.

Oh, man.
Where is your flare, Dad?

Help!

Anyone?

Ash:
I took the red-eye to Virginia.

Winchester: You, too?
What is it with this place?

Ash: I have to head off
potential litigation.

People here are completely nuts.
24 hours.

Ash, the ink isn't dry
on your contract.

So if one of you isn't back
in 24 hours,

you're both terminated.
I understand, sir,

but my GPS
isn't working at all.

Hmm. Okay.
Was that a llama?

Hello? Hello?

Okay, let's keep the chatter down.
Please and thank you.

Let's do this.
Ready?

Okay.
I think we're all set here.

Carl, I think we got enough of you
and the Smithy boys.

Yeah.
Okay. Want me to hold the boom, or--

I think we--
I think we got it from here.

Appreciate the stuff, though.
Great stuff, really.

Okay, great. Thanks.
Good stuff.

Sorry.
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

I am sitting here with none other
than Lily Tisdale.

Now, she is the daughter
of Ray Tisdale,

the original Smithy spotter.

Have you ever seen the monster?
Hmm.

Well, there was this one night
where my dad was fishing late

and my mom started
getting scared,

and when he finally
drug himself in,

he was soaking wet, and he said
this huge lizard had capsized the boat.

Smithy?
Yeah.

He said it was all like--

Was it now?
Mm-hmm.

Now, you tell me this.
What do you think that was?

Oh, that he was drunk
and he flipped the boat himself.

( laughs)

Cut it, cut it. Tell me you got that.
I got it.

Lily, that was beautiful. That's gonna be
very very wonderful on television.

All right.
You're a natural.

Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I am going to give you my card.

And if you can think of anything else,
you don't hesitate to give me a holler.

As a matter of fact,
Steve's gonna be spending some time.

He's got to transfer tapes
and the-- and technical nonsense.

But, I've really got
to get back to the motel.

You think you can give me a ride?
Sure.

Producer, huh?

Might bring a chaperone.
Futterman: No need.

You were great-

Will you hand that to Steve?
Yeah.

Lily: Mom, can you make sure
the neighbor kids get home?

Sara?

Sara? Sara?

Boat trouble?
Tyler, thank God.

I can't get her started.

Do you have gas?

Oh, I forgot you like them gassy.
Ha-ha.

Dispatch, we've got a newbie here.
Newbie?

The gauge was broken.
"Mysterious Disabled Boat Syndrome."

We're gonna tow her in.
Dispatch: Roger.

I've got to get to the D.A.'s office.
You're not gonna make it.

Besides, I just saved your life.
You owe me dinner.

Oh, come on.
You know what could've happened here

if I hadn't come along?
Bad sunburn,

giant radioactive catfish,
the BFL.

Let's go.
Okay, you win, you win.

Watch your head.

Hey. Can you tell me how to get
to Scruggs Road?

Ooh, you know it'd be easier
to take ya than to tell ya.

It'd be quicker on the water.
You got a boat?

Do I look like I have a boat?
No, son.

You look like you have
an attitude problem.

Hicks.

Futterman:
I am glad I asked you for a ride.

I would've been lost
with this.

Okay, front seat's all yours.

Good girl.
I like the paint.

Yeah, I did it myself.

Thanks for letting me be
a part of this show.

My mom will get
a real kick out of it.

No, that's my pleasure.

You seem destined
for far greater things.

Thanks.
I'll tell ya.

Would you like to go to my room
and have a drink?

Would you like that?

I would, but I'm working
on something and I really got-

Focus. You're focused, aren't ya?
Mm-hmm.

I could tell
the first time I saw you.

Well, I'll tell you what.

Tomorrow,
before the stakeout,

you give me the inside story
on the Smithy nuts,

and you and I,
AKA the two of us,

will go
and have dinner.

What do you say to that?
I will--

I'm gonna take that
as a yes.

I'm gonna take that as a yes,
served on a bed of yes,

rinsed down
with a cup of yes.

I'll see you tomorrow!

Good night!

You are a terrible chaperone.
Terrible.

Sara:
Smells good.

Chilean sea bass.
fingerling potatoes...

and some Keswick
"vee-on-yay."

It's local.

I always thought when they said "local"
they meant "moonshine."

There's about 20 wineries
in the region.

Sara:
Hmm.

What is all this?
Uh, artifacts.

I find 'em while I dive.

It's for another book
I'm writing.

Another?

Well, technically, I'm on sabbatical
from my day job.

I'm a professor
at Virginia Tech.

My first book's right there.

"Knots"?
The other one.

Oh.

"Lake Effects...

Infinite Ripples,

by Dr. Tyler Humphries."

My doctoral thesis.
Pretentious as hell, yes.

But everybody
calls me Tyler.


Oh, I found this.

Thought you'd like it.

That's my favorite color.
Yeah, I remember.

You know what? Save it.
I really have to--

Oh, come on.
One more drink.

I'll tell you about the ruins.
On the lake?

Oh, it's dangerous.

There's a lot of places a diver
can get snagged, you know?

Barbed wire fences
and tree branches.

And visibility's
just piss-poor.

Just when you thought
you'd seen it all,

you gotta look
a little deeper.

I mean, it's amazing
down there.

There's houses
with cans of food

lying in the pantries.

So we can have
clean energy.

And all this.

And that's why
you came back.

I'm just trying to honor the people
who lived here, you know?

What are you doing?
Beautiful night for a swim.

No, it's not.
It's freezing.

Coming?
No.

Oh, I forgot.

You're not from here
anymore, are ya?

Newbie.
Hey.

Oh, it's on.
-( water splashing )

Whoo-hoo!

( Coyote howls )

( owl hoots )

<i>Hey.
Tyler?</i>

Oh...!

I have a boyfriend.

I heard that somewhere.

( Rooster crows )

Hello?

Anybody?

Come on. There's gotta be somebody
on one of these boats.

Morning.
Oh, hey.

Thank God.
Someone who's awake.

My GPS is dead.

Is this Smith
Mountain Paradise?

That's on the other side
of the lake.

What are you doing over here?
Don't ask, dude.

I spent the night waiting for the boys
from "Deliverance" to show up.

Can you tell me how to get there?
Sure.

But you'd make better time
on the water. You got a boat?

Do I look like--

No.
No, I don't.

All right,
what you want to do,

you're gonna go
about 10--

You know what?
Why don't you come inside?

Got some coffee and a map.
We'll get you squared away.

Thanks.

All right, we are here.

And you needed to be here.
Oh.

Hey, you mind if I--
Go ahead.

Uh, Tyler?
What is my bra doing-

Sara?

Oh, my God.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Me? What are you
doing here?

You backwoods son of a bitch!
Ash! Stop it!

My boat got towed
and I couldn't get home last night.

What are you doing?
Ash, look-- Ash!

Predator, prey!

Wait a minute.

If you're not the predator,
you're the prey.

Rapture Real Estate?
Who sent this?

Rapture's bringing in
huge revenues.

You represent
Raptor Real Estate.

That's why you came here.

Rapture.
I did it for you.

So that you'd have clients
in your hometown.

I had no idea they owned
your parents' loan.

Now grab your stuff
and get in the car.

I'll even forgive you for being
with "goober boy" over here.

You'll forgive me?
Go home, Ash.

You owe me.
I'm not going home without you.

Ah!

You've ruined my mom.

How soulless
can you be, Ash?

Hunt for those...

"predator."

What if Futterman
doesn't find anything?

What do you mean by that?
I mean, what if he sets up

with all his cameras and lights
and Smithy doesn't show?

You heard him.
That's when they bring out all the...

CSI.
Vic: Larry's right.

You know what they do
on his show.

He's gonna make us
look like idiots.

Nobody can make us
look like idiots.

Only we can do that.

We gotta make sure
he sees something.

Yeah. How?

Guys,
I think I've got a plan.

Whew...

I coulda taken him,
you know.

Come on, "slugger."
Let me buy you breakfast.

I can't.

You gotta eat sometime.

I can't do this.

Hey. hey-

Before you run out again,

without telling me why,
at least-

at least let me put all my cards
on the table.

I love you, Sara.

I've always loved you.

Now, if you could see
what's in my heart-

It's not you, I'm sorry.

Sara!

Carl is gonna be
so surprised.

You know what? You'd better hurry up
and get that thing to the dock.

Let's go.

Futterman, you want Smithy,
you got Smithy.

Careful, careful.

-( Dog whining)
Louie, what is it?

What is it?

( Barking )

( sobs )

Irene down at the bar told me
your Ashland and you had a fight.

You all right?
All right?

I just cut my own throat.

To fight Rapture,
I'd have to fight my own firm.

I was in line
for a partnership.

Now I'll never be able
to face Winchester again.

You know how proud I am
of all you've accomplished?

I know you didn't want to end up like me.
No, Mom.

That's not why I left.

Sara, why don't you
just tell me

what it is
you've got to say?

I have-

You think you gotta tread lightly
'cause I allowed myself

to fall into
the depths of grief.

I loved your father
with my whole heart.

But I'm not that fragile.

Now, I chose this life.

I chose family
and community

and simplicity and nature

over wealth and power

and position and fame.

Now, I respect your choices.

I know folks in your neck of the woods
don't respect mine.

But I expect you
to know better.

I taught you to be
a straight shooter-

rifle or man.

You just take a deep breath,

relax...

and squeeze
that trigger slowly.

That's how you handle
Mr. Winchester.

I am not accustomed
to negotiating

with my own employees,

but I'm sure we can come
to terms, Ms. Tisdale.

Persuade me,
Mr. Winchester.

I will stipulate that
Rapture should have been

more rigorously vetted
before Ash signed them.

So, how can our client
avoid criminal proceedings?

Rapture returns ownership
of the house to Vivian Tisdale.

Done.
And pay six months of her mortgage

to the bank for time and suffering.
Done.

The same goes for Tinnell's Market,
Jim Powell's boat,

and 14 other owners.
I'll forward a list.

Agreed.
Anything else?

Your client is through
with Smith Mountain Lake,

in fact, in the entire
Commonwealth of Virginia.

In exchange, you will not
pursue any criminal action

against Rapture for any infractions
or tortious activity,

nor will you involve
any third party.

Mm-hmm.
Deal.

You're a good lawyer,
Sara.

Your values
are your strength.

Now get the hell back here.
What about Ash?

That person
no longer works at this firm.

We did it.

It's finished.

( gasps )
Dad would have loved that, Lils.

Chairman McCarren:
My fellow citizens.

Chairman McCarren:
My fellow citizens.

We have dozens of Virginia's
finest vintages on tap--

well, not on tap, of course.
That's beer.

I mean, uh, decanted.

No, no, you can't decant.
That would've been done by then.

Breathing!
Vic: These are fertile Smithy waters here.

â™ª We're one goodbye
from losing this â™ª

â™ª One tear away
from one last kiss â™ª

â™ª I don't behave... â™ª

Elizabeth?

Side salad,
water with lemon.

Hell, if I had your body,
I'd eat like a rodent, too.

So, how did you know
my father?

Ray was a good friend

when not too many
other people were around.

How-- how good a friend?

I didn't have the most
wholesome reputation,

but it didn't mean
I deserved a man like Waylon.

Ray got me out of there.

He gave me money
for a room.

He even took me
to see the doctors.

I never knew that about him.

You were too young
to know about such things.

I will always be grateful
to your daddy.

Did he ever call you
by any kind of nickname?

No.

Some folks here call me Liza,
but I hate it.

I prefer Elizabeth.

Elizabeth.
Mm-hmm.

Then who is Betty?
Betty? Hmm.

Hey, come on down
to the lake.

The Exploratory guy's
doing a project for TV.

Come on.

Carl: We often pick up
some motion right around here.

'Course, we don't have
the fancy equipment that y'all have.

Yeah, 'course you don't.
No.

Hey, Carl.

Me gusta, baby.
Me gusta.

Cameraman: Ready?
Futterman: Okay.

All right,
you know what?

Let's get a countdown from five.
Get it rolling.

In five, four,
three, two--

I am standing here with Carl,
on the shore of Smith Mountain Lake--

The package is in play.
Repeat.

Cut it, cut it.
The package is in play.

What is-- you hear that?
The package is in play.

Excuse me!

Yes, thank you!
We're rolling sound here!

Hey, come on, everybody.
Just pipe down.

Hit it again.
I'm sorry about that.

It's fine, it's okay.
Sorry.

Here we go.
And we're rolling.

I am here with Carl on the shore
of Smith Mountain Lake,

to get a look at a sea monster
they think lives beneath the water.

( "Ride of the Valkyries" playing )

Futterman
is gonna love this.

Sara: Where's that music
coming from?

Ladies and gentlemen,
keep your eyes on the horizon.

This is the first modern
documented sighting

of a lake monster.

( Music continues)

Bring it back around.
Let's get the heck out of here.

I can't.
What do you mean you can't?

You wired it, Boy Scout.
It's not turning-

like there's something pushing us!
Why'd you wire it wrong?

Hello, I would like
to introduce you--

( snapping )
I-- excuse me!

Could I have your attention, please?
What?

We have Miss Virginia here,
for goodness' sake!

Pay no attention to those idiots!
What is that?

I don't know.
Is that a joke?

No, sir.
Is that a joke?

Is that our Smithy?

I am so sorry.
( feedback squeals)

(flame roars,
music continues)

I think that's some of my--

Are you trying to make a mockery
of Mark Futterman?

Is that what you're doing?
I would never think of doing that.

Russell: It's not stopping!
We're gonna hit the rocks!

You laughing at me?

No, wait, Mr. Futterman, please.
Smithy is real.

If you just let me explain-

Please do not go--
Crap. Crap!

( Music stops )

Carl?

You shoulda asked me.
You know, I do a really mean Smithy.

( Growls )

You think I knew
about this?

Come on, it's made
out of scrap metal.

Carl: They must've done it
out of love.

You're telling me you had
nothing to do with that?

No.

Still, though, I'm not gonna
throw away an entire friendship

just for one stupid,
stupid mistake.

Carl:
I know what's in their hearts.

The least I owe them
is to let them explain it.

Rascals.
.' We can see forever .'

â™ª And some say it's heaven â™ª

â™ª I found my heaven
in your eyes... â™ª

Oh, Sara. Sorry to hear
about your father.

Well, sorry for what happened,
not sorry to hear about it.

Of course I heard about it.
Your father's well connected in this town.

Oh, yes. Look, I think Miss Virginia
needs your help, Mr. Chairman.

Oh, excuse me. Official duty.
Yes.

I'm gonna tell you what. That's the
last time I answer an unsolicited e-mail.

Can't be all bad.
Beautiful view,

great wine,
friendly people.

You sound like
a travel brochure.

Free tour,
if you're interested.

You might be destined
for bigger things.

Let's talk.

Hey. You married, huh?
No.

Engaged?
No.

Boyfriend?
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

That's great, 'cause my grandson's 26
and he'd be perfect for you.

Yes, well, are you thirsty?

â™ª Words in the moonlight... â™ª

You're supposed
to spit it out.

Why waste
perfectly good wine?

Do you know who did this?

That's mine.
I did that painting.

It's astonishing.

How much
are you asking for it?

I'm sorry.
It's not for sale.

I love how it glitters.

Let me know if you change your mind.
Okay.

I'm opening an art gallery
in Bridge-water Marina.

I'd love to commission
something like it.

A landscape of my view.

Oh, thank you.

â™ª And you're the reason why â™ª

â™ª Stars are falling â™ª

â™ª And so am I... â™ª

Oh!
-( audience laughing)

Dottie-'s gonna set me up
with a studio space

behind her gallery,

and, she's got contacts
with dealers in D.C.

Oh.

She told me I could go home
whenever I wanted.

Oh, Mom.
This is painful.

Lily, you were a beauty.

Yeah.

What happened?
Hey! Jerk.

Just hand me the gear,
Mr. DeMille,

if you'd be so kind.
Ray: Hold your horses.

Hey, guys! This is me and Big Vic
and we're going fishing!

Hey, Big Vic. What kind of bait
we using this morning?

Only the finest quality.

The kind
the masters bait with.

Honey, that was Vic
that said that, not me.

I'm going blind
over here!

I don't understand
why he left you like that.


I made him go.

A man needs to spend time
with his friends.

And so did I.

He was cheating on you.
Sara--!

Your entire marriage.
Don't be silly.

Her name was Betty.
-( laughing )

Before you girls were born,

we both worked
in sales at Carrulean.

Ray was on the road
all the time.

So?
Well, when he was traveling,

we used to write to each other,

and he got it into his head
to call me "Betty."

Like Betty Boop.

You're Betty?

Well, didn't you ever wonder
why letters addressed to someone else

ended up in our attic?

But those letters.
They're-

they're filthy.
Uh-huh, I know.

Ugh.

Lily:
I'm in the room here.

Gross.

I missed
all of your anniversaries.

I missed every-

Oh, shh.

I thought I'd be a hypocrite.

Oh, honey.

Oh, my girls.

( Water splashing )

Dad?

How could I believe
Betty was real?

Maybe you needed
to find your own road.

Didn't you care when I stopped
coming home to visit you?

Daddy?

When I stopped
answering your calls?

Of course I did.

Maybe you needed to believe
that Betty was real,

or something like that,
to give you the strength-

to give you the fire
to venture out in the world.

But I love you more
than you'll ever know, darling.

I love you so much.

Well, look at that.
You found it.

I probably looked for that thing
all over the lake.

You're gonna do just fine,
sunshine.

Just fine.

-( Wind whistling)
Dad?

Morning.

Good morning, sunshine.

Would you like
some French toast?

Sara! Lily!

Duty calls.

Get the roast out of the freezer.
I want to cook it tonight.

I never would've guessed.

She looks happy.

-( Horn honking )
Whoops-- there he is.

He who?
I got a date.

Hey, Carl.
Hey, Lily.

Wait.
Oh.

Have fun
in La-La land.

-( Phone ringing )
Oh.

Whoever that is,
I will call them later.

See you soon.

Lily:
This is gonna be fun.

â™ª Can I rekindle this flame â™ª

â™ª That burns
within my heart? â™ª

â™ª We hit the finish line running â™ª

â™ª After one or two
false starts â™ª

â™ª Can I rekindle this flame â™ª

â™ª That burns
within my soul? â™ª

â™ª We hit the finish line running â™ª

â™ª But we made our way
back home â™ª

â™ª We made our way
back home â™ª

â™ª We made
our way back home â™ª

â™ª We made our way
back home â™ª

â™ª We made
our way back home â™ª

â™ª We made our way
back home. â™ª

â™ª You are like a sweet dream â™ª

â™ª In the middle of the night â™ª

â™ª You are like a healing touch â™ª

â™ª To a blind man's sight â™ª

â™ª You are like a soothing voice â™ª

â™ª Into a baby's ear â™ª

â™ª You're so far away â™ª

â™ª Soon enough you'll be
right back here... â™ª

Excuse me, ladies.
Yeah?

Know anything
about a sea monster

lives out in the lake?
You ever hear anything about that?

Been a rumor about a 600-pound catfish
out by the dam.

Whoa, that's a lot
of Long John Silvers, isn't it?

You know this is
a man-made lake, right?

It's only 45 years old.

No, ma'am,
I did not know that.

Well, what she means is that

Smithy probably
swam into the lake

once the valley
had been flooded.

What's wrong with you?

â™ª But her name sounded
like something â™ª

â™ª Right out of a fairy tale â™ª

â™ª Her hair's so dark,
her eyes so blue â™ª

â™ª Man, I'm telling you â™ª

â™ª I can't explain
the way she looked â™ª

â™ª I can't explain
the way she shook... â™ª

Miss?

Uh, miss.
Could you tell me--

Oh, you again.
Never mind.

No, no, no, it's okay.

I... I live here.

Oh.
What are you looking for?

â™ª I told my daddy
the chores would wait â™ª

â™ª I put the latch
on the garden gate â™ª

â™ª And I headed over
the Chestnut Ridge to you â™ª

â™ª I can see to the county line â™ª

â™ª And I can feel
in my heart this time â™ª

â™ª That I'm closer now
than I've ever been â™ª

â™ª To you â™ª

â™ª I'll say Sarah â™ª

â™ª Sarah â™ª

â™ª Would you love a heart
like mine? â™ª

â™ª I know your love is true â™ª

â™ª I will be holding you â™ª

So high.

â™ª I'll make â™ª

â™ª You shine â™ª

â™ª The Parker farm's for sale today â™ª

â™ª 30 acres of rolling hay â™ª

â™ª And I've got some money down
for you â™ª

â™ª Granddaddy's
got an old John Deere â™ª

â™ª It needs a wheel
and a pinion gear â™ª

â™ª I've got everything
I need now but you â™ª

â™ª I say Sarah â™ª

â™ª Sarah â™ª

â™ª Would you love a heart
like mine? â™ª

â™ª I know your love is true â™ª

â™ª I will be holding you â™ª

So high.

â™ª I'll make â™ª

â™ª You shine â™ª

â™ª When the evening stars
shine their light â™ª

â™ª I'll find my way home â™ª

â™ª And in the morning hours,
you call my name â™ª

â™ª And darling, I will come â™ª

â™ª Oh, Sarah â™ª

â™ª Sarah â™ª

â™ª Would you love a heart
like mine? â™ª

â™ª I know your love is true â™ª

â™ª I will be holding you â™ª

So high.

â™ª I'll make â™ª

â™ª You shine â™ª

â™ª Oh, Sarah â™ª

â™ª Oh, Sarah... â™ª

â™ª Could you love a loving heart â™ª

â™ª Like mine? â™ª
