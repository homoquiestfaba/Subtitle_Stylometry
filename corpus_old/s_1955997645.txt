â™ª Here's the time to shine
when you're fighting crime â™ª

â™ª Power it up â™ª Who's got the power?

â™ª We got the power

â™ª Breaking through the wall,
gonna do it all â™ª

â™ª We don't quit â™ª Who's got the power?

â™ª We got the power

Oh! Yeah!

â™ªâ™ª

Buttercup: Okay,
put it over there.

Bubbles: Over here?

No, Bubs, over on...

[ Crash! ]Ugh...

-And there we go!
-Oh, it's perfect!

Do I even want to know
what you guys are doing?

Only if you're interested
in a little thing called...

the truth.

â™ª Dooo-dooo-dooo-dooo

It's out there.

Aah! Oof!

We're building
an intergalactic portal,

so we can make
contact with aliens

from
the Xanchronian Nebula.

The blueprints are
in this month's copy

of Paranoid Boys' Life.

Ugh, you guys!

There's no such thing
as space aliens.

You know
how I know that?

Because there's
absolutely zero proof.

If you can't see it,
it doesn't exist.

Well, we will see it
very soon, or them.

Point is, we know
what we're doing.

It's all very scientific,
Blossom.

Hey, Barry, where
does this toaster go?

Just cram it in anywhere.

Okay.

Wait, is that
my toothbrush?

Well, we couldn't use
one of our toothbrushes.

You expect us to meet
aliens with bad breath?

Ugh, fine!

Enjoy talking to aliens.
Tell them I say hi.

Okay, will do.

Barry: T-minus 15 seconds
until activation.

Safety goggles?
-Check!

-Tinfoil hats?
-Check.

"Welcome to Planet Earth"
fruit basket?

Big check!Okay.

Activating space portal

in three, two, one!

â™ªâ™ª

Nothing's happening.

Aw, but we followed
all the instructions.

[ Roaring ]

[ Screaming ]

Dude, it's an alien.

Blossom says hi.

I am Bleeblar from
the Xanchronian Nebula.

Take me to your leader.

Me! It's me!
I'm the leader.

Lies! Bleeblar knows there is
no way you are the leader.

Uh-oh.

I shall now
destroy your planet

with my mighty alien powers.

Together:
No! Please! No!

Take Barry!

[ Laughs evilly ]

[ Blossom laughing ]

Ha! Gotcha!

Together: Blossom!

Very funny, Blossom.

[ Laughs ]
It was funny, wasn't it?

Aw,
where you guys going?

Don't you want to take
a picture with Bleeblar?

[ Laughs ]

Oh, wait, Buttercup!

â™ªâ™ª

[ Snoring ]

All this sleeping
is exhausting.

[ Yawns ]

Some strawberry milk
should help.

â™ªâ™ª

Ahh!

Yum-believable.

Huh?

Ugh, they left that
thing plugged in?

What a waste of electricity.

Hmph.
I can't believe these guys,

all the junk
in the backyard.

I'm going to take
my toothbrush back.

Wait, where is the off switch
for this thing, anyway?

[ Portal hums ]

Huh? What's going on?

[ Electricity crackling ]

Uh....

Chiroo!

Whoa.

Chiroo!

What -- what are you?

Chiroo!

[ Trills ]
Uh. Wait!

What's a Chiroo?

[ Chirping ]

â™ªâ™ª

Whoa!

Chiroo!
Chiroo, chiroo!

Wow!

What -- Wait!

Chiroo! Chiroo, chiroo!

Whoa.
[ Laughs ]

Oh, wait, wait! Stop!

Chiroo!
Whoa.

Chiroo, chiroo!

[ Laughs ]

Hey, hold up!

Chiroo, chiroo, chiroo!

[ Trills ]

Chiroo, chiroo.

Wow!

This is incredible.

Chiroo!

Chiroo?

[ Trills ]

Chiroo, chiroo!

Chir-chiroo.

Chiroo, chiroo![ Laughs ]

Yay!

Chiroo, chiroo! Chiroo!

Whoo-hoo!
Chiroo, chiroo!

â™ªâ™ª

[ Yawns ]

Good night, Chiroo.

[ Purrs ]

Mm...

[ Gasps ]
Chiroo! What?

[ Gasps ]

Buttercup, Bubbles, wake up!

Did you see it, last night?

The alien!

Yeah,
we saw your costume.

Har-har-hi-larious.

No!
I went out to the portal,

and a real alien came out,
a real one!

He made a forest
appear in the backyard,

and we danced, and he went,
"Chiroo, chiroo,"

and there were fireflies,

and he drank an entire
glass of strawberry milk!

An entire glass
of strawberry milk?

[ Mockingly ] He must be
some sort of galactic monster

from beyond Pluto!

Fine, I'll prove it.

How do you explain this?

Huh?

Blossom, raccoons
aren't space aliens,

but they are so adorable,
it's out of this world!

That was where he
made the tree grow,

and this is where we danced
with the fireflies.

Where did it all go?

Do you think that,
maybe, just maybe,

you dreamt it all?

No! Chiroo is real.

Wait, ha! That's it!
I'll call him out.

Yeah, that'll work.
Chiroo, Chiroo! Chiroo!

Listen, I think there's
a perfectly good explanation

for all of this.
-There is?

Yes.

You're a nutbar.

Chiroo is real!

Then where's the proof?

You said it yourself,

"If you can't see it,
it doesn't exist."

But it does exist!
You'll see Chiroo!

I'm going to prove it.
You'll see! You'll all see!

Chiroo, Chiroo, Chiroo!Okay, I'm out.

[ Raccoon chirps ]

You said it, Ignatius.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Gong clanging ]

Bloss, what are you--Shh!

Bloss, this alien business
was fun before,

but now it's getting
a little crazy.

[ Growls ]

Is it crazy to find proof?

Is it crazy to know
what's really out there?

Is it crazy to dress up
a raccoon as Napoleon?

Kinda.[ Growls ]

You're distracting me.

[ Gong clanging ]

Ugh,
back to the gong again?

Barry:
I'll take it from here.

Barry Macherbacher,

paranormal investigator

and ghost-o-tologist.

So, Blossom, tell me
about this alien you saw.

He came from the portal.
He has magic powers,

and he smells like
cinnamon mocha swirl.

Cinnamon mocha swirl, eh?

So is Chiroo real
or not?

Um, hard to say.

See, the alien you
described to Buttercup

looks nothing like the creatures
from the Xanchronian Nebula.

If one of them came
through the portal,

it would look
more like this.

Really? I thought it would
look more like that.

[ Roaring ]

[ Screaming ]

Buttercup!

Bubbles!

This looks like a job
for Barry Macherbacher,

paranormal investigator!

Ignatius, help!

[ Raccoon chirps ]

Oh.
Waterloo all over again.

[ Grunts ]
It's pulling us in!

Um, if we go through
the portal, is that bad?

â™ªâ™ª

Only if you want your organs
on the outside.

Okay, Bloss,
call off Chiroo.

Ugh, this isn't Chiroo!

[ Energy pulsating ]

Yeah!
-What?

[ Whoosh! ]

-Whoa!
-Aah!

-Whoa!
-Aah!

All: Ugh!

[ Gasping ]

-Aah!
-Whoa!

[ Roaring ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ Crash! ]

Chiroo!

All: Ooh!

[ Trills ]

Chiroo!

It's gone.Then, that means...

Ha! I was right!
I told you Chiroo was real.

Uh-huh, oh, yeah! I was right!
I told you! I was right!

Pbbt! [ Laughs ]
-You're still a nutbar!
