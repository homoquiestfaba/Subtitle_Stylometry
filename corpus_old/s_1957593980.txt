No Clothes (2012)(Gay Short Film)

Nice shirt!

What? Me?

Your shirtâ€¦ is really nice.

Oh really? Thanks, it's old.

It looks really comfortable.

I guess.

What fabric is that made of?

Gonna have to go with cotton on that one.

100% Iâ€™m sure.

Iâ€™m Joseph.

Alan.


[cellphone vibrates]

Hey babe, whatâ€™s going on?

Yeah? Ok. Alright. Bye.

Would you by any chance mind watching my stuff real quick? I'm just running an errand.

Totally.
Thank you.

Whatâ€™s wrong sweetie?

Somebody stole my clothes!

Donâ€™t worry, your friend took them.

My friend, what?!

Fuck!

Hey!

What are you doing here?

Hmm...

That's my shirt.

No, itâ€™s not.

Yes it is, it doesnâ€™t even fit you.

It looks actually ridiculous. Give it back. Now.

Make me.

Seriously. Youâ€™re gonna hit me with a hanger?

Relax!

Relax.

Give it back.

Now.

Get it off.

Pants too.

Ok, oh right.

Oh right.

What?

These are mine.

Yeah, they look really good.

Thanks.

I like these.

Yeah?
Yeah.

I got it from the laundromat down the street.

Itâ€™s opened 24-7, you know.
