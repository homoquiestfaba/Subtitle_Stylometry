MAN: <i>Are you ready?</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

(LAUGHTER, CHATTER)

What do you guys think?

These outfits are to <i>die </i> for.

I need a serious second wind
before I compete today.

(CELL PHONES CHIME)

Hey, what's that?

"To Kayla,

good luck today,
love, dad."


I have had my eye
on this dress for weeks.

Your dad's the best.
I know.

How do I look?
You look amazing.

Nick is going to pass out
when he sees you in that.

Nick!

ANNOUNCER: <i>What up, Summit Valley?</i>
It's time to ride!

<i>Next up, representing</i>
<i>Swift Snowboards,</i>

<i>is Nick Swift!</i>

<i>This year, Sebastian Swift</i>
<i>is relying on his son Nick</i>

<i>to bring home the gold</i>
<i>at "Fire and Ice."</i>

<i>Coming in for his first hit,</i>

<i>a big frontside 9.</i>

<i>A backside melon</i>
<i>with some style!</i>

<i>A huge backside 9,</i>

<i>and look at that amplitude!</i>

<i>And the landing!</i>

<i>Fantastic ride by Nick Swift!</i>


<i>And the judges reward him.</i>

<i>And the boys winner</i>

of this month's
snowboard challenge

is once again Nick Swift!


<i>All right, next up,</i>
<i>team Swift's reigning champion</i>

<i>in girls half-pipe,</i>
<i>and repeat champion</i>

for, oh, about six months now,

but who's counting,

our very own Kayla Morgan!


Patrick, where's my daughter?

Uh, has anybody seen Kayla?

<i>Anybody at all?</i>

There she is!


Oh.

Now, this is what I call
fashionably late.

<i>And Kayla Morgan down into
the pipe for her run.</i>

<i>Frontside air, with...</i>

<i>A little bit of air.</i>

<i>Another frontside, with...</i>

<i>I guess some style.</i>

<i>And she holds on</i>
<i>for the landing.</i>

<i>All right.</i>

Now, let's see what
the judges have to say.


And the girls winner
once again, folks,

give it up for

<i>Kayla Morgan!</i>
<i>All right!</i>

<i>With wins today</i>

<i>from both Nick Swift</i>
<i>and Kayla Morgan...</i>

<i>Team Swift is poised</i>
<i>to be the team to beat</i>

at this year's Fire and Ice.
Honey.

That's my girl.
Hi, daddy.

Another victory.

You make it look so easy.

Hey, Mr. Morgan. Yo.

Hey, Nick.

You looked great out there.

You think so?
I know so.

Well, just wait till
you see me tonight.

Oh, really.

I'm getting some serious
dad eye right now.

Well, it's not you.

You're the best boyfriend ever.

No, he's just really
overprotective.

He doesn't want me to get hurt.

Well, that's too bad.

'Cause it's really
gonna hurt...

When I beat you to the lodge.

Oh, yeah!
Good luck with that!

Comin' through!
Whoa!

(DOG BARKING)

You're good,

you're doing good,

and you're good,

and you're good.

And...

oh, no.

Donald.

He play roadkill on you?


Oh! Does he always do that?

Only when he's bored.

That pooch has personality.

Almost gave me a heart attack.

You goin' somewhere, mom?
Uh, yeah, hon.

I had to pick up a shift at the cantina.
I'm sorry.

I thought the point of quitting your
other job was to start a business.

Yeah, well, now
I need to pay for it.

Things Will pick up here soon,
I promise.

Oh, and you remembered to use the
anti-frizz conditioner on Chimchim, right?

Dog pound gangsta.

We're out of anti-frizz.

Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry.

Ohh, what happened here?


What? That's my boy.

I miss that smile.

It's the same smile.
See?

Please put that away.
That's behind me.

Eh..

Never say never.

(DOOR BELL JINGLES)

Come on, buddy.
Let's get some fresh air.

BOTH: Whoo! Whoo!


You can't catch me!

Whoo!

Whoo! Ha ha!

Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

I'm gonna win!
Whoa!

I win.

Ha ha! Nice.

(DOG BARKING)

You got the top down,

sun in your face,
wind in your hair...

who could be depressed
on a day like this?

Will Cloud.
Now, <i>that </i> is sad.

He got hurt, Nick.
It's not his fault.

But still, I mean, the guy
was a legend in the making.

Now he just drags
tourist dogs around all day?

I gotta look away.

That's better.

You are so cute.

Hey!


Oh, hey, let me help you.

Yeah, that'd be great.

Of course.
Go jump in there.

Okay, smile.

(CLICK, BEEPS)
It's great!

Yeah, this sign is the pride and
joy of Summit Valley Resort.

Word is this sign was
crafted from an old oak tree

felled by beavers at
the turn of the century,

carved by artisans
and maintained

by a very devoted team of...

yep, it's a really old sign.

Comin' in!
Yeah! All right, Dink!

What's goin' on, dude.

How ya doin'.

Hey, Donald, say hello
to Sam and Dink.


How ya doin'?

Barometric pressure's
dropping steadily,

temperature's holding
at 32.2 degrees.

This is a great day to get
back on the slopes, man.

Dude, check the pressure in your <i>head.
Weather's fine.</i>

Look, Will's not gonna
go back out there

just because we're due
for several inches

of the most pristine powder
of the season.

Is that your attempt
at reverse psychology?

Yes.
Did it work?

No.

Whoo!
Yeah!

Ohh!

Aww!

Seriously?
Relax, Cloud.

It's just a little bit of snow.

You don't like it maybe you and
your little girlfriend there

should go to the doggy park.
He's a male.

Ho ho!

And the Mountain air
is good for his joints.

What?! Ha ha! Later!

Just think how good it would feel
to burn these guys on the pipe.

They'd stop laughing
real quick.

I'm not competing
this season, guys.

Come on, man.
Just give it a try.

Okay. Well, look,

there's always a place
for you on the team

if you change your mind,
you know that.

Thanks.

Let's ride.

Um, I'm not the valet.

It's a little unfair,
don't you think? What?

Best female boarder around,
prettiest girl on the carpet,

<i>and </i> your dad throws
a killer party?

My dad owning the resort
does have its perks.

Hey, dad.
Hey.

Hey, coach.
Wasn't Nick great today?

Yes.

Not great enough.

I think my lift's
getting a lot stronger.

Hello? It <i>definitely </i> is.
Really?

I heard the air
he caught on his lift

had to be a new personal best.

Wow. I just don't know
if his personal best

is gonna be enough
to win at Fire and Ice.

Gotta <i>be </i> the best.
Period.

Yes, sir.

Don't listen to him.

We were great today,

and we have the trophies
to prove it.

(CROWD ROARS)

Hey, everybody,
I'm Sebastian Swift.

How we doin'?

Welcome, welcome, to the Summit
Valley Fire and Ice kick-off party

brought to you by Swift gear.

Let me hear it!

ALL: Ride Swift
or ride slow!

Whoo!

We're not here for me,
we're not here for me.

We are here to celebrate
our future stars. You ready?

Two-time local champion,
my son, Nick Swift!

(ALL CHEER)

Thattaboy.

Whoo-hoo!

Next up, the man
who slices through air,

Mike Lamb, otherwise
known as the wizard!

Whoo!
(ALL CHEER)

Boost and bangin', yo!
Whoo!

Next, the human cannonball,
Burke Brighton!

(ALL CHEERING)

And last but most
certainly not least,

our number one glamor girl,
Kayla Morgan.

(ALL CHEER)

Hi.

As many of you know,

Kayla's dad owns
this beautiful resort,

so Richard,
where are you, my friend?

Richard? There he is.

Richard Morgan
and his lovely wife Madeline.

Now, as you guys know, the fire and
ice event is coming up real soon,

but what you might not know
is that this year

Team Swift Will be
taking home the gold

on national television!

(ALL CHEER)
That's right!

All right!

With that, I'll let you guys
get back to your party,

d.J, hit me. Thank you,
everybody!

(MUSIC BLARES IN DISTANCE)


It's not as fun as it looks.

That's one part of the game
I don't miss.

NICK: Dad, it's a party.

Can we talk about this later?

Look, Nick, I'm not trying to
be a bad guy here, come on.

But you gotta start
thinking like a winner.

Okay? You gotta be Willing
to do whatever it takes.

All right? Come on,
you know I'm right.

Hey.

You okay?
Yeah.

Why do you ask?

You just seem upset.

Everything's cool.

Okay.
You know my dad,

he's just intense.

Yeah, yeah.

For a minute I thought
it might be me.

(NEWS SONG STARTS ON SOUND SYSTEM)

This is our jam.

(LAUGHTER, CHATTER)

KAYLA: I'm so stoked.

I mean, Team Swift
on national TV.

Do you have any idea what this kind
of exposure is gonna mean for us?

I think I'm gonna
step up my game.

You know, bust out some new moves.
Like what?

Like the Cloud 9.

You know, the move doggy day care
tried when he broke his leg?

Yeah....
But nobody's ever

successfully
pulled that move off.

I mean, isn't Will Cloud the only
one who even knows how to do it?

I can figure it out.

I'll just watch his wipeout on
Youtube till I get the moves down.

Oh, yeah? You want
a sno-cone for dessert?

You <i>better </i> run!

(LAUGHTER, CHATTER)
Hold still!

Try this!

Dudes, check this out.

Come on!

Come on, get on.
Whoo! All right!

Now slide me like a shih tzu!

Here we go!
Get off.

Why? Because it looks like fun,

and you're not going first.

Kayla, your chariot awaits.

That sled looks nasty.

Come on, it'll be fun.

Don't let a few clumps of wet
dog hair ruin the moment.

Come on.

Don't you trust me?

Ohhh.

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

This is gonna be epic.

You ready?
Yeah, I guess.

Ha ha ha!
Whoo-hoo!

Whoa!

NICK: Hold on tight!

Aaaah!
This is awesome!

This is kinda hard to steer.

Nick, slow down!

(KAYLA SCREAMING)

I can't control it!
What?!

I'm sorry, Kayla!

Aaaah!!!

Aaaah!

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)


Oh, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Aaah!

Ohhh!

Hey, you.

Come on!
Go! Go!

KAYLA: Sir, this was
an accident, I swear!

We were just goofing around!

What do you mean "we"?

Guys?

(OWL HOOTING)

Great.

Thanks.

(PHONE RINGING)

Hot Doggers.

Yep, this is Will.

My sled is what?

Once again, our sincerest
apologies,

and I truly appreciate
you keeping this between us.

Mr. Morgan, I'll do
whatever you want,

since you...
Own the resort.

I'll just say I ran into the sign
with my snowplow or something.

Great.

I'm sorry.

Don't apologize to <i>me.</i>

Apologize to Will.
You broke his sled.

Will, I'm really sorry.

That was totally
not cool of me,

and I hope that
you can forgive me.

Huh.

Now, I'll fix the sign,

but you're gonna have to pay
for Will's sled yourself.

Will's mom is our newest
tenant here at the resort,

and I betcha she could
use an extra hand.

What do you mean?
What he means is,

you're gonna work at the dog
kennel every day after school.

What?!
Huh?

Dad, I don't have time
for that!

Then you better
make time, Kayla.

That is unless you want to
tell me who else was involved.

No?
No.

How's three P.M.
on Monday?

Great. It's settled.

Well, see ya at three. Sorry to
interfere with your busy schedule

of shopping
and spending daddy's money.

Ha! You don't even know me.

Oh, really?

So tell me, what are you good at?
Besides accessorizing.

Um, first of all, accessorizing
isn't just a skill, it's an art.

And second of all, I think everyone
knows that I shred major powder.

That's overstating it a bit.

Excuse me?

I've seen you ride.
You're decent, but sloppy.

You don't finish your moves,
and your transitions are weak.

Then how did I make
the Swift Team?


Your daddy owns the resort.

That has nothing to do with it!

Yeah, walk away,
doggy day care!

Why don't you go find some...

Poop that needs scooping?

Bye.

Kayla. Hey.

Oh.
Ow.

Are you okay?

What do you think?
You abandoned me.

We panicked and ran.

I thought you were
right behind us,

but when we turned back,
you weren't there.

Well, I totally got busted
because of you guys.

And now I'm literally
in the dog house.

I have to work at the <i>kennel.</i>

It's so unfair that
you went down for this.

I was just telling the guys, if I
could trade places with you, I would

in a heartbeat.

I have to go.

I'll call you.

(CABIN DOOR SLIDES SHUT)

VOICEMAIL:
<i>Hey, it's Nick.</i>

<i>I'm chillaxin'.</i>
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

<i>(BEEP)
Hey, Nick, it's me.</i>

Just, uh... Give me a call
when you get the chance, okay?

(DOOR BELL JINGLES)

Here is buford's medication,
along with a schedule.

Of course, Mr. roarke.

We Will take great care of
buford, and the... Schedule.

Very well.

Be brave.
(DOG WHIMPERS)

First day and you're late.

Not as late as
that flannel shirt.

Hello?
Are we in Seattle?

I think you're gonna find when
you bathe a 50-pound bloodhound

it's not the time
for a fashion statement.

All right, boys,
this was not my idea,

but let's make the best
of the situation.

(DOG WHINING)

Aaah. What are you doing?

Letting the dogs out
so they can meet you.

You don't want 'em to see you
as a threat and... Attack.

Yeah. Gotta say,

not really sensing the threat
of impending doom here.

They're depressed.

You would be too
if you were cooped up all day.

If it wasn't for my sled rides,
they'd hardly ever get out.

Please. If anyone
should be depressed here...

It's me.

Whatever.

First order of business:

Fill... The food bowls.

I can't.
Come on, buford.

Will! I'm allergic to dogs!


(DOGS WHINING)

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

SEBASTIAN:
<i>Kayla, it's Sebastian.</i>

<i>I heard about your,</i>
<i>uh, escapade last night.</i>

<i>The Swift snowboarding team</i>
<i>code of conduct</i>

<i>you signed</i>
<i>when you joined the team</i>

<i>gives me the responsibility</i>

<i>to remove any athlete</i>
<i>under my charge</i>

<i>for conduct unbecoming</i>
<i>the team.</i>

<i>Therefore, your blatant disregard
of the rules forces my hand.</i>

I'm afraid as of now you are no longer
affiliated with Swift snowboarding.

You can turn your Swift gear in
<i>to the equipment manager.</i>

<i>I'm sorry about this, Kayla,</i>
<i>but... You leave me no choice.</i>

(DOG WHINING)

Uh-oh. Heh. Angry lady
missile, three o'clock.

I'm off the team.

Your dad kicked me off the
team because of the accident.

Nick, you have to talk to him.

Kay, it was either you or us.
What was I supposed to do?

Wait. You knew? You knew he was gonna do
this to me and you didn't say anything?

Kayla, we didn't have a choice!

Do you really want me to come forward
and get us all kicked off the team?

No, but if your dad knew
that we were all to blame,

then maybe he'd ease up
on the punishment.

We can't take that chance.

The competition is
right around the corner.

Yeah, and the team is
gonna suffer without me!

No, we won't, actually.

Wow. Look at the time. Heh heh.

You can't win this competition.

shredder in Summit Valley, Nick.

I've been winning the
challenge here all season.

Kayla, my dad made sure
that only girls you could beat

went against you in the challenge.
Who told you that?

Everyone knows that.
Your dad wants you to win.

My dad wants to keep your dad happy
since he's bankrolling the team.

Kayla, you're all worked up.
Now, just calm down.

Calm down?!

I thought I was good,

and now I might
actually be <i>bad.</i>

You're not bad.

You're just...

Not great.

And you knew that...

And that Sebastian rigged all
the competitions for me to win.

Yeah... no.

Well, uh, I-I suspected.

Uhh! What's it matter
about winning or losing?

You're out there having fun.
Isn't that what counts?

This? This is not <i>fun, </i> dad.

This is pretty much
the exact opposite of fun.

No wonder everybody thinks I'm
just daddy's little rich girl.

Kayla, people are <i>always</i>
<i>gonna be jealous of you,</i>

but you feel no shame because
of my success in business.

Ohh. I don't, dad.

I feel shame because I was acting
like someone that I'm not.

And if I knew that
I wasn't any good,

I would have worked harder.

Because I know
that I could be great.

I'm a fake...

And everyone knows.

Including you.

Oh, honey, I...

I was just trying
to protect you.

I love you.

Y-you know that.


(DOG BARKING)


What's up, dude?

I didn't know you
had a twin brother.

He's been seeing double

ever since he tried a cab 7
melon grab on the half-pipe.

Hi!

Hi.

Didn't exactly stick it.

Hey!

You got a new assistant, Will?

Yeah, something like that.

Look, I <i>thought</i>
<i>i could nail it.</i>

I've been practicing,

and last night I saw an owl.

What does that have to do with anything?
It's a good omen, Dink.

And he thinks <i>my </i> weather
forecasts are crazy.

You want to know what I think?

I think you released the board
before the descent.

You gotta keep your knees bent
while staying in position.

You been doing those stretches
I showed you? Yes! Yeah.

Look, my head is pounding.

And I'm starving.

Those are doggy treats.

I think we need
some pizza therapy.

Wait. Will.

Where are you going?

To get pizza. I'm hungry. What?!

Here. Secure Donald
in his cage,

and then there's a list
of everything you need to do...

On the counter.


NICK: <i>Hey, it's Nick.</i>

<i>I'm chillaxin'.</i>
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

<i>(BEEP) Hey, Nick.</i>

It's me. Again.

Just, uh, give me a call

when you... Get the chance.

Okay, bye.

Okay, come on.

"Secure Donald
in his kennel."

There you go, Donald.

(DONALD GROWLS)

I hope we're not going
to have a problem here...

Donald.


"Give buford a bath."

Who is buford?

Buford...

Okay. Come on, boy.
Let's go. Bath time.


Don't just <i>lie </i> there.
Get... Up!


Okay, clearly,
I do not speak dog.

See, buford?

Life is never so bad
that you can't wash your hair.

But believe me...

This is a new low for me, too.


Donald!


Donald! Uhh!

(ALL BARKING)

Get back here right now!


No!!!

KAYLA: Hey!

Stop!

Heel?

Uhh!

(DOGS BARKING)
KAYLA: Come back! You!

Slow down! Do not
make me get angry!

I think that we are not
understanding each other!


(AWKWARD GIGGLE)

Hi.

Hey, are you okay?

Yeah. I'm great.
Heh heh.

I, um, I've been calling you.

Have you not gotten
my messages?

Oh, yeah. I dropped
my phone in a puddle,

so it's probably dead, you know?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Sounds alive to me.

Uh, Kayla,
I need to talk to you.

Ohh, me too.

I <i>really</i> want to
thank you, Nick.

For what?

For telling me the truth...

about my dad
and the challenges and...

Like, I'm just so grateful that
through everything I still have you.

Y-you kind of smell like dog.

I know.

Look, Kayla, I don't know
how to tell you this...

you don't have to say anything.

So I'm not on the team...

just gives me more time to cheer
for my superstar boyfriend.

Yeah, that's not
gonna work for me.

Why not?
I'm a great cheerer.

No, no. The part about
me being your boyfriend.

You see, I gotta focus
on my training right now,

and I can't have
any distractions.

So I'm a distraction?

I'm sorry, Kayla.

I wish things
were different, but...

If you want me to win,
I gotta have my space.

What happened?

Ask Donald.

That dog is mean and cruel
and no friend of mine.

(DONALD WHINING)

Today has been
the worst day of my life.

I got kicked off Team Swift,

Nick broke up with me,

I chased these dogs
halfway up a Mountain,

and then I ruined
my super-cute boots!

Gosh, that's terrible.

I'm sorry, honey.
Thanks.

I'm fired though, right?

No! This was not
your fault.

You should have been trained
before you were left on your own.

Oh. So this is my fault?

No. Will, I don't
blame you at all.

I accept full responsibility,

and I understand completely

that you <i>need to fire me.</i>

Let's get you something
warm to drink

and get you dried off,

and you can take the rest
of the day off, okay?

So you're <i>not </i> gonna fire me?

No.

Oh, man!


Kayla? Step away
from the light.

It's like snow.

Like the finest,
fluffiest powder

on a winter's day.

One day it's there,
and then, poof!

My whole life just... Melted.

Can I just start by saying

Nick Swift doesn't deserve you,

and he's a complete idiot for not
seeing what an amazing catch you are.

And <i>i </i> never liked him.


She never liked him, either.

Thanks, guys.

But honestly, I did.

I liked Nick.

And I liked competing,
and being on the Swift team.

And now...

That's just... Gone!

Remember when I failed my
drivers ed test three times?

And I had to take the <i>bus</i>
<i>to the dance recital?</i>

And then I met that cute guy who
ended up taking me to homecoming?

Yeah.
This is like that.

Maybe something really great
is gonna come out of all this.

I don't know, pia.

You got... Cute bus guy

and I got...

A kennel full of smelly dogs.

Well, to be fair,
Will Cloud isn't uncute.


What's "epic fail"?

It's what they call
Will's crash on the Internet.

His video won some award for
most epic fail of the year.

There's an award for that?

(LAPTOP CHIMES)

Ohh. I never could
bring myself to watch this.

VIDEO ANNOUNCER: <i>Welcome back to the
Fire and Ice finals championship,</i>

<i>and there he is, Will Cloud,
ready for his final run.</i>

<i>This kid is really</i>
<i>on top of his game,</i>

<i>and you just have to love</i>
<i>his winning attitude.</i>

I can't believe that's Will.

<i>All he has to do is complete</i>
<i>this final run</i>

<i>and he beats Team Swift for the
Fire and Ice championship.</i>

<i>And I hear he's got</i>
<i>something special for us</i>

<i>a move he's invented</i>
<i>called the Cloud 9.</i>

<i>Beautiful front 7.</i>

<i>Into a cab 7, huge air,</i>
<i>sticks the landing.</i>

<i>Here comes the Cloud 9.</i>

<i>Oh, he's off line!</i>

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>he's gonna make it!</i>

Whoa.

(POP MUSIC PLAYS ON CAR STEREO)

(TURNS MUSIC OFF)

Aaaah!



Oh, no.

On top of everything...

I'm a dog killer!

Come on, boy. Come here.

(DONALD BARKS)

Wait. He was <i>faking?</i>

Yeah. We call him
"Donald roadkill."

He's got a sick sense of humor.

That's a relief.

I don't know what I would do with myself
if anything happened to you, Donald.

Wow! Somebody's
taken a liking to you, boy.

Whatever.

KAYLA: Does it ever occur to you

that the dogs might
be less depressed

if this place was, like, less...
Depressing?

What do you mean?

You seriously haven't noticed
it's a little blah in here?

We don't really have the money
to make it less blah.

It doesn't take a lot of money
to have a whole lot of style.

I found this pair of vintage
tortoise shell sunglasses

in the thrift store
last week for fifteen bucks.

I mean, they can retail
upwards of five hundred.

Sorry, I think I actually
fell asleep

in the middle of your story.
Ha ha.

I'm just saying you guys would probably
have a whole lot more customers

if this place were
a little... Classier.

Appearances aren't everything.

Says the boy
covered in dog hair.

Hasn't this been
your whole problem?

That you've been appearing
to win all these trophies

without actually deserving them?

What's under the surface
is more important.

I take substance
over style any day.

Okay.
So let's make a deal.

I'll help you make this place
look better on the outside

if you help me show
people that there's more

to me than what they
see on the surface.

And how would I do that?

Train me to compete
in Fire and Ice.

You're joking, right?

Will, it's all about potential.

I mean, I know that I'm not the champion
snowboarder that I thought I was,

but with some coaching
and some really hard work,

I think I can win a medal
that I actually deserve.

And I know this place
may look really shabby now,

but I think I can turn it
into something really special.

We both win.
I'm not a coach.

Oh, come on!

I heard you with your friends.
You know your stuff.

The last time I rode,
I tore a tendon in my knee,

shattered my ankle
and collapsed my lung.

I almost died.

Yeah, but you're
all better <i>now, </i> right?

This conversation's over.

I saw your video.

To be as good as you were,
you have to really love it.

And if you love it that much,
you can't just walk away.

Well, I did.
Come on, boys.

Uhhh!

So because one thing happened
one time, you're gonna

lock yourself up in your house
for the rest of your life?

Honestly, Will,
what are you so afraid of?

I mean, you know that fall you had
was a total freak accident, right?

Oh, so I'm a freak now.

I'm just saying that if you
were to get back out there

the chances of something like that
happening again are super-low.

Look, even if I agree to train
you, you don't have a team.

Well, what about them?

DINK: Check this out!
WILL: Sam and Dink?

Whoo-hoo!

They're your old teammates,
right? It's perfect!

Obviously we'd need to have a serious
discussion about team uniforms,

but I have some ideas.

I can't imagine you being
serious enough to compete.

You spend more time styling outfits
than working on board technique.

That is not fair, because
styling comes naturally to me.

And I can change.

So bring on
the board technique.

I don't know, Kayla.

Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

What's up, bra?

BOY: Go, Skye! Whoo!

Whoo!
Yeah, Skye!

Go, Team Swift!

Yeah!

Looks like they didn't waste
much time replacing me.

That was a killer run, Skye.

You saw that?
Oh, yeah.

Wait a minute. Is that...

Skye Sailor.

But... she's with
pro ice in Aspen.

I've heard she's never lost.

You know, the Swifts didn't
just kick me from their team.

They also beat you, and you
haven't competed since.

They don't think
either of us is a threat.

Wouldn't it be great
to prove them wrong?

What is she talking about?

Kayla's gonna join your team,
and I'm gonna coach you.

Oh! Ha ha!

DINK: Yeah!

Yeah! Uh, wait, wait.

You mean you're
gonna coach <i>her.</i>

Right? Because, I mean,

we all know that
I don't need coaching.

You know? 'Cause
I'm the best <i>ever.</i>

(ALL CHUCKLING)

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

PIA: Let me make sure
I have this right.

You and Will Cloud
are forming your own team

to compete at Fire and Ice.

Me, Will, and these two.

Well, <i>hello, </i> ladies.

Ahem. Low pressure system
movin' in this afternoon.

What are you, a weather man?

I dabble.
But if you're interested,

I could show you some of the
finer points of snow formation.

No, thanks.

Just think about it.

I know. I know.

NICK: Yeah, cool, man.

Catch you later, man.

Be strong.


Did he just
silent what-up me?!

(EXCITED CHATTER)

Is <i>that </i> the girl
you were talking about?

Skye Sailor.

She just moved here from Aspen.

Like Fire and Ice wasn't gonna
be hard enough already,

now I have to compete with her.


You're right, linds.

She obviously doesn't know
that double studs are over.

There is no emoticon to express the
tragedy of her fashion choices.

I pity her.

Good form.

Good amplitude.

Crisp holds.

(CROWD CHEERING)

She's <i>good.</i>

Yeah, I know.

Thank you, everyone,
for the warm welcome.

As exhausting as it is
being a celebrity,

fans like you make it
all worthwhile.


Hi. I'm Skye.

So I've heard.

Oh. Would you like
an autograph?

No. I'm fine, thanks.

Come on, don't be silly.
Anything for my fans.

Who should I make it out to?

Kayla.
As in Kayla Morgan.

Maybe you've heard of me.

Of course I have.

Hmm.

"To Kayla.

Everybody's favorite
daddy's girl."

Actually, why don't you
make it out to

"Kayla, future winner
of Fire and Ice."

And how are you gonna do that

now that the competition
<i>isn't </i> rigged?

I don't know. How are you
gonna deal with those split ends

I could see from all the way
across the Mountain?

It's a good thing Nick's dad
replaced you with me.

Now team Swift has
a chance of <i>winning.</i>

We'll see about that.
Mm-hmm.

Split ends?

She started it.

You want to show Skye Sailor
what you're made of?

Stop trading insults
back and forth

and beat her at her own game.

Over there.

You're right.

<i>â™ª Wakin' up,</i>
<i>ready for some action â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª strappin' in,</i>
<i>ready for the ride â™ª</i>

concentrate and land it.

<i>â™ª Now that I can take it</i>

<i>â™ª all the way to Cloud 9</i>

bend your knees!

<i>â™ª Droppin' in,</i>

<i>â™ª sun is out, the wind</i>
<i>is in my hair â™ª</i>

Watch your airs!
<i>â™ª ...else could be quite as awesomeâ™ª</i>

<i>â™ª as when I'm soaring</i>
<i>through the air... â™ª</i>

this is your idea of working?

Yes, actually.

Donald here was in desperate
need of a mani-pedi.

A what?
Trust me.

Depression is no excuse
for cuticles like his.

Okay, boy. Go take those
babies for a test drive.


KAYLA: See?

Everybody feels better
when they've had a makeover.

Which reminds me, I have
a project to attend to.

<i>â™ª So here we go</i>

<i>â™ª and we're gonna</i>
<i>take it slow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª we're ready now</i>

It does.

After about fifty more times.

Nice grab.

<i>â™ª Don't give up,</i>
<i>keep on takin' chances â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Put in time</i>
<i>till you get it right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm on Cloud 9</i>

wow.

You guys, I'm blown away!

You like it?

I love it.

And clearly, so do the dogs.

This must have cost a fortune.

WILL: Not for Kayla.

She's a bargain-hunting
machine.

Well, you two
make a great team.

Hey, have you seen the dog brushes?
Yes. I washed them.

Rufus did a number
on the large ones.

I thought you were
allergic to dog hair.

I'm just allergic
to bad hair in general.

And right now,
Rufus is one up on <i>you.</i>

You kiddin' me?
I like my look.

Yeah? And what look
is that?

Shaggy dog?
You love it.

Okay. You just keep
tellin' yourself that.

Hey, why don't you two
call it a day?

You sure?
Yeah.

I can close up here.
Go have fun.

All right.
I'll be right back.

Thank you, Kayla.
Of course.

No. I mean,
thank you for Will.

I haven't seen him this happy
since back when he was competing.

After his accident, I didn't know
if he'd ever be the same again,

but he's got
his old smile back.

Thank you.

Check this place out.

Have you ever noticed how sometimes
that Mountain looks really...

Scary?

Yeah.

Tyson's peak <i>is </i> scary.

Ice, wind, jagged rocks,

75-foot drop
off the vertical face.

It's intense.

Some people want to
snowboard down it,

but you can't get up there
without a helicopter.

Well, has anyone ever tried?

Yeah. Tyson.

They never found his body.

(BOTH LAUGH)

No, but seriously,
snowboarding down Tyson's peak

is... It's impossible.

Nothing's impossible.

So tell me honestly,

what do you think our chances
are at Fire and Ice?

I'll admit,
at first it was shaky,

but you guys are starting to look
like a real threat out there.

Because...

I've been thinking
about something

that could make our team
an even bigger threat.

Oh, yeah?
What's that?

You.

Me?

I think you should
compete with us.

That wasn't a part of our deal.

I know, but Will, I've
seen you out in the snow.

You look like you belong there.

I've never seen anyone
who loves it like you do.

You need to get back out there.

I don't think so, Kayla.

Come <i>on.</i>

I mean, you heard your mom,
we make a great team!

So let's make it official and let's
take down the Swifts together.

Just... Promise me that you're
gonna think about it, okay?

Okay. Good night.

Good night.


MADELINE: I spoke with
Will Cloud's mom last night.

She said Kayla's doing great
at the dog spa,

and I guess Will
is coaching their team.

RICHARD: Yeah, I heard that
she's working really hard.

You say that
like it's a bad thing.

Well, I hate to see her
try so hard only to fail.

Isn't there any chance
she might win?

Against the Swift team?

Honey, that's impossible.

Nothing's impossible.

I want you to teach me
the Cloud 9.

And I want world peace.
Can you get me leash?

You said it yourself, Will.
I've made real progress.

You have.

Okay. So then
what's the problem?

I mean, you're my coach,
right? Coach me.

It's not that simple.

You don't believe in me.

You're just like my dad.

After all this, you still think
I'm all style and no substance.

You've got it all wrong.

It's not about whether
I believe in you...

it's about whether you
believe in yourself!

What do you mean?

Up on that Mountain,

when it's just you
and your board,

it doesn't matter
what anyone else thinks.

You cannot be afraid...
not even for a second.

It takes no fear.

And you're just not there yet.

Do you think that's
what happened to you?

You wiped out because
you were afraid?

Will, I watched your video.

I saw you out on the half-pipe
with that big smile on your face.

I mean, you belong there.

I mean, the Cloud 9 could be a
second chance for both of us.

You're still not ready.

I have done everything
that you've shown me!

It's too dangerous!

For me or for you?

(DOOR CLOSES)

Hi, Marshall.

Kayla. Hey, what's up?

I'm here for my ride.

Today. In that.

Um...

I think there
must be a mistake.

I'm booked out all afternoon.

Oh, but my dad said he called
you weeks ago to schedule this.

I'm gonna have to
give him a call.

He's gonna be pretty upset that
I interrupted his meeting.

Uh, wait a minute. Wait. Um...

not a problem.
Plenty of room.

Plenty of room.

Plenty of room.

Hey.

Be careful.

Circle around.
We gotta get this.


Nothing's impossible.

No doubt.

No fear.

CO-PILOT: <i>Base, I've got</i>
<i>this teenage girl,</i>

<i>Kayla Morgan, gonna board</i>
<i>down Tyson's peak.</i>

<i>You gotta take me live.</i>

BASE: <i>Copy that.</i>

Okay, time to go live.

It's Kayla!
(ALL MURMURING)

Yo. Ha!

Check it out!

Kayla?

Great!

(ALL OOHING AND AAHING)

Kayla?



(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Oh!

(LOUD CRACKLING)

Aaaahhh!!!

She's crazy!
Come on, Kayla!

Oh, no.

Aaahhh!!!

Come on, Donald,
we don't have much time.

She can't breathe
under the snow.

<i>Get search and rescue.</i>

(CONCERNED CHATTER)

Go find her, boy.
(DONALD BARKING)

Kayla! Kayla,
where are you?

Kayla!

Kayla!

Kayla. Kayla, come on.

Come on, Kayla.

Kayla!

Kayla!
Kayla.

Kayla! Kayla, hey,
can you hear me?

Oh, come on, say something.

Nothing...

Is...

Impossible.

You risked your life
just to prove a point?


(ALL CHEERING)

CO-PILOT: <i>She's all right.</i>

(KAYLA LAUGHING)

(BOTH LAUGHING)

WILL: I still can't believe
you jumped Tyson's peak.

It's the only thing I thought
would impress you enough.

Impress me for what?

For what else? Cloud 9.

Kayla.

It took me months
to learn the Cloud 9.

But that's because you were...

Creating it
and figuring it out, Will.

I mean, now it's all about
guidance and technique, right?

I just want to be great, Will.

You were great.

I just want the same chance that you
had to do something incredible.

The Cloud 9 was
a triple cork mctwist 1440...

With a couple of grab
modifications for stability.

That's three rotations.

That sounds impossible.

I did it in a practice run.

So teach me.

Brought you guys some towels.

I should go.

Yeah, it's...
Getting really late.

SAM: If you were a few inches
taller you could dunk.

Man, I'll be in there.

You can try.
You know it.

Uh, what's goin' on?

Will's agreed to join our team.

Bro!
Yes!

But... We don't just
accept anyone.

So let's see what you got.

And hey, no fear.

Whoo! Go, Will!
Yeah!!!

You see this?

ALL: Whoo!

SAM: All right, Will!

KAYLA: Oh, go, Will!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Uh-oh.


Will?
Ho ho ho!

Come on.

Once an epic failure,
always an epic failure.

Come on, guys.

Will!

Will! Will.

Somebody go get some help!

Aaah!

I gotcha.

Were you playing
roadkill on us?

Yeah. But I'm okay.

I'm a little sore,
but I'm okay.

Don't ever scare me
like that again.

Ow!

I need you.

I need somebody to
teach me the Cloud 9.

What?
What?

Will says that I'm getting

a whole lot stronger.

And he says that
if I stay really focused,

I can even compete with...

Skye?

Glad to see you're
enjoying your "space."

Hello, Kayla.
Nothing personal,

we just weren't a good match.

Yeah. Winners should
be with winners.

Sorry things didn't
work out with us.

No hard feelings, okay?

Hey.

Hi.

Uh, so, do you think
that my hands are small?

They look fairly
regular-sized to me.

Um, why don't you hold it
a bit more normal?

Is this better?
Yeah. Much.

Um...

See ya after school?

Yeah. Same time,
same channel.

KAYLA: So what makes her
so special?

Who?
Skye!

I mean, sure,
she's a great athlete,

and she's traveled,
and she's totally hot.

But besides that, she literally
has nothing else going for her.

<i>â™ª Got my high heels on and my new short
skirt â™ª there you go! The melon!</i>

â™ª I don't need to try...
Yeah! Backside 5!

<i>â™ª My makeup's fly,</i>
<i>all I need now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª is to find a good time</i>
<i>there you go! Bigger!</i>

That's what I'm talkin' about.

<i>â™ª Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª tasty like a chili pepper,</i>
<i>can't you take the heat? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª be ready for a dancer</i>
<i>if you come along with me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª yes, I'm burning,</i>
<i>feeling so free... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

Nice.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah â™ª</i>

how am I supposed
to compete with <i>that?</i>

Are we still talking
about snowboarding?

What else would we
be talking about?

NICK: Great run, Skye.

Forget it.

Let's start on the Cloud 9.

<i>â™ª The worried days</i>
<i>are over now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've been lost</i>
<i>and I've been found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª another day, yeah</i>

<i>â™ª no more waitin'</i>

part one. You got it?

Yeah.

<i>â™ª There's more to life</i>
<i>than passing time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm getting deeper</i>

<i>â™ª yeah, it's gettin' nearer</i>

you got it, Kayla.

<i>â™ª I can't help it</i>

<i>â™ª I'll always be a dreamer</i>

â™ª nothing's gonna stop me now

<i>â™ª whatever comes,</i>
<i>the way I'm feeling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª you'll never</i>
<i>break my spirit â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª nothing's gonna</i>
<i>bring me down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª oh, no, oh oh, oh oh oh â™ª</i>

you gotta get more tuck.

<i>â™ª Oh oh, oh oh oh</i>

<i>â™ª isn't fair</i>
<i>how much I stress â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª creating more,</i>
<i>forgetting less â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I was burned and down</i>
<i>and getting nowhere â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª because of that</i>
<i>i looked outside â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª there's more to life</i>
<i>than passing time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm getting deeper</i>

<i>â™ª yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>it's getting nearer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª yeah, I can't help it,</i>
<i>I'll always be a dreamer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª nothing's gonna stop
me now â™ª she'll get it.</i>

Wait. Your board.

<i>â™ª The way I'm feelin'</i>

<i>â™ª you'll never</i>
<i>break my spirit â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª nothing's gonna</i>
<i>bring me down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm gonna keep holding on</i>

<i>â™ª I'm gonna keep holding on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't help it,</i>
<i>I'll always be a dreamer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª nothing's gonna stop
me now â™ª you okay?</i>

Yeah.

Um...

I think I just need
to take a break.

Maybe get some food.

Get my energy back.

Okay.

I'm getting this, right?

Yeah. You just gotta
get that grab.

Okay, great.
Are you coming?

I'll catch up with you.

Okay.

Gotta hand it to you, Cloud.

Team's lookin'...Better.

Thanks.

Especially Kayla.

She is one determined girl.

Once she gets an idea
in her head, that's it.

Like learning the Cloud 9, that
was probably her idea, wasn't it?

She can handle it.

I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about <i>you.</i>

It's bad enough the Cloud 9
ended your career,

but if Kayla doesn't pull
it off and she gets hurt,

that'll be on you.

All right, here we go.

Backside 5. Take your time!

Okay, crippler 7!

Up... Top...

Nice!

All right, Cloud 9.

Double cork. One...

Two...

Uhhh!

Ohhh!

Did you see that?

That trick Kayla's working on,
what is that?

That's the Cloud 9.

She can't actually
pull that off.

Not yet, but I wouldn't
count her out.

You said you could beat her.

Yeah. And you said she was a
pampered princess with no talent.

But you were wrong.

That girl can ride.

You're hesitating!

I can see it in your turns!

You know the moves,
but you're not attacking!

Okay. So then...

I'll go again.

No.

That's it.

We're out of time.
You're just not ready.

Are you giving up on me?

I'm not gonna teach you this
move just to watch you get hurt.

It's not worth it.

What's not worth it?

I think we both know what this
competition is really about for you.

What?!

That little hand-holding stunt
you pulled in school?

I think it's pretty obvious all you
care about is winning Nick back.

That's not true.

I mean, things are
so different now.

They're not different enough.

We're done.

Yeah, we're done.

I need to stop wasting my time
with guys who don't believe in me.

I'm in this
one hundred percent.

And I don't care if Nick
or my dad...

Or anyone else thinks that
I can't win at Fire and Ice.

But I need you
to believe in me.

I believe in you.

Kayla.

You don't look happy to see me.

Yeah.
Can you blame me?


And that's what
I want to talk to you about.

Listen, I owe you an apology.

I should never have kicked
you off the Swift team.

I'm man enough to admit
I made a mistake,

and I'm just hoping
you'll give me another chance.

'Cause I want you
competing with us tomorrow.

What? Swift snowboarding
has a chance

to set the world on fire.

I want you to be part of that.

I want you wearing
a Swift jacket tomorrow.

Are you serious?
Yes.

But what about Will?
And our team?

Oh, please. But let's talk
about that after Fire and Ice.

Right now, this is about <i>you...</i>

And whether you want to be part of a
team that's gonna put you on the map

as the most well known
female boarder

on the national circuit.

Think about it.

Okay?
Okay.

I hope you make
the right decision.

All right?

All right,
what do you guys think?

See any lucky owls
outside, Sam?

Hey, bro, we don't need luck.

Yeah, he's right.

Forecast calls for
victory, straight up.

Where's Kayla?

I, uh, I think I can
help you with that.

KAYLA: I'm here!

Hey, there you are.

Hi.
Hey.

As of last night, Kayla
rejoined the Swift team.

I'm sorry.

Welcome back, kiddo.


What are you doing?

I forgot to turn in
my Swift gear.

I couldn't wear it anyway.

I mean, teal is just...
So last season.

You're gonna regret that.

You're... you're...
hey, Kayla.

SEBASTIAN: Kayla! You had
me worried for a moment.

Sorry, but it's gonna take a whole
lot more than a new uniform

to get rid of me.

Oh, they came just in time!

I give you the Kayla Morgan
designed team uniform for...

Hot Doggers!


Nice.
Thank you.

Turned out great.

There you go, hon.

Okay. Donald, up.

Whoo! All right, we're gonna
go find a good spot to watch.

Break a leg. I mean,
don't break a leg.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Do great.

(CHEERS, APPLAUSE)

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>go home, 'cause this event's</i>
<i>for maniacs and shredders!</i>

(FIREWORKS POPPING)

<i>Up first, men's half-pipe.</i>

<i>The crowd is ready to see these
top-notch riders throw down!</i>

We got this!

<i>Oh, and a nice cab 7.</i>

<i>Beautiful landing.</i>

<i>Goes for a backside 9</i>

<i>and absolutely eats it.</i>

<i>Up next, Will Cloud.</i>

(CHEERS, APPLAUSE)

<i>A frontside 7 indie</i>
<i>into a cab 7...</i>

Whoo! Whoo!

<i>A nice front 9...</i>

<i>Followed by a front 7.</i>
Ahh!

<i>What could be a major upset</i>
<i>after the first round,</i>

<i>Will Cloud has the lead</i>
<i>over Nick Swift.</i>

<i>Coming up, run 2.</i>
<i>Will Cloud.</i>

<i>Will dropping in.</i>

<i>Nice method.</i>
<i>Look at that air.</i>

(CROWD CHEERS)

<i>Follows it up</i>
<i>with a beautiful front 9.</i>

<i>Into a cab 7.</i>

<i>Amplitude and style,</i>

<i>Will Cloud, excellent run,</i>

absolutely nailing the landing.

<i>Next up, Nick Swift.</i>

<i>Third jump, and it's cab 9.
</i> Come on!

<i>The crippler!</i>
<i>Oh, whoa!</i>

<i>My goodness!</i>

<i>Into a front 9...</i>

<i>Look at that style and grace!</i>

Oh, wow.

<i>Rounding it out</i>
<i>with two amazing flips.</i>

Yes!

Yes!

It was the close at the top,

but the winner of
the men's half-pipe,

from Swift snowboarding,
Nick Swift!

Not bad for taking a year off.

Watch out for me next year.

<i>It's clear who's vying</i>
<i>for overall team victory.</i>

<i>All the men's top finishers</i>
<i>are either from Swift</i>

<i>or from Hot Doggers.</i>

<i>Next up, women's half-pipe.</i>

<i>We've seen some great rides here
</i> from our first two competitors,

<i>but no doubt the crowd</i>
<i>is anticipating the showdown</i>

<i>between Skye Sailor</i>
<i>and Kayla Morgan.</i>

Come on, Kayla!

<i>Next up, Kayla Morgan!</i>

<i>Whoa, a nice one by Kayla!</i>

Whoa!

<i>Would you look at that?</i>

<i>Into an indie!</i>

Yeah!

<i>And she rocks out a crippler!</i>

<i>Unbelievable!</i>
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

<i>She is all over her style</i>
<i>and execution.</i>

<i>That is a huge run</i>
<i>for Kayla Morgan.</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

<i>Skye Sailor of Team Swift</i>
<i>up next.</i>

<i>Skye dropping in,</i>

<i>starts out strong.</i>

Whoo!

<i>Into a cab 7,</i>

<i>a very strong cab 7,</i>

<i>for a beautiful, solid run.</i>

<i>After the first round,</i>
<i>Kayla Morgan</i>

<i>is giving the unbeaten</i>
<i>Skye Sailor a run for the gold.</i>

Whoo!

<i>Women's run two, Skye Sailor.</i>

<i>Into a front 5.</i>

<i>To a back 5.</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>A beautiful front 7!</i>

<i>Can she stick it?</i>
<i>Yes, she does!</i>

Man.

Look at the scores!

Yeah!

Oh, wow!

Skye Sailor with a killer run!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Yeah. Come on, girl.

Beat that.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE CONTINUING)

I'm gonna go find Kayla.
Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a
heroic effort from Kayla Morgan,

our final competitor.

But it's gonna take an
impossibly perfect performance

for her to beat Skye Sailor
for the women's title.

Kayla.
Dad?

I owe you an apology.

When I saw you
up there tonight...

I realized how much
I'd underestimated you.

I'm sorry for that.
It's just...

Ohh.

You've always been
my little girl...

But tonight I've realized

you've really grown up.

I couldn't be
more proud of you.

Hey. <i>Hey.</i>

Come here, hurry up.
Check this out.

You see that?

Huh? All that
sappy fatherly pride

is gonna take the edge off her

right before she drops in.
That's gonna help us.

How's a father supporting
his daughter a bad thing?

Oh, come on!

What?

You know I don't see any point
in excessive praise, all right?

How about <i>any </i> praise?

Anything?

You know, dad,
believe it or not,

there are some parents that
are proud of their kids

just for who they are,

without making them win
medals or cheat to get ahead.

Hey. Be careful what you're
doing right now, okay?

Here's an idea.

How about we tell Kayla
what <i>really </i> happened

with her and Will's sled?

Hey. This is not the time
or the place for this,

okay?

Nick.

I steered Kayla into that sign

so my dad had a reason
to kick her off the team.

What?!

I was just following orders.

Yeah. Like always.

So tell me, dad,
you proud of me now?

Everything I've
always done for you,

I mean everything, has been to
help you achieve your dream.

It's not my dream.

It's yours.

I'm sorry, Kayla.

You're going for it,
aren't you?

Nothing's impossible.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I can't imagine the pressure
Kayla must be feeling.

Not only is the women's
title in play,

but also overall team victory.

With the Swifts leading,

Kayla Morgan would need
to do something spectacular

to win both the women's event

and give her team glory

over Sebastian Swift's club.

Come on, Kayla.
No fear.

No fear.

Ladies and gentlemen,
our final competitor,

Kayla Morgan!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Yes! Come on, Kayla.

One...

Two...

Three...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Oh, yeah!

Yeah!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Whoo!

For the first time ever,

someone has finally
landed the Cloud 9!

Can you say unbelievable?

Whoo!
