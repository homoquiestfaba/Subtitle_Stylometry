When you go to London

You are a person who does not come home for Christmas.

And he tries to

I can not lose him, I could not.

You need to relax.

I'm always awake.

This aircraft has not landed.

No one got out of this plane.

Then where is he?

can not, just that I've got him!

You're thinking I'm crazy,

If he disappear?

I know where he is.

I was so scared, when I saw

Then why are you still here?

It is in the Bible.

camp in the summer time,

everyone is talking about this.

They say that one day
millions of people will just disappear.

Millions?

Moreover, they say?

I do not remember.

It's been a long time.

What did you say, this act of the devil?

Not.

It is the Lord.

Do not tell me you believe this.

It does not matter what I believe.

Where are they? Where did they go?

Go to heaven.

No you're not.

Maybe he's better off without

No, I do not have.

But I have a mother.

But it was all to no avail.

I came home from school one day,

and I found him.

He just lay there,

silent, do not you do that to Katie.

I may not know what is happening
these days, but this is not the fault of Katie,

what do you hear me?

Yes.

If he's out there right now,

see us.

Yes, that's good.

Give me that.

Hey, this is not about us.

It's about the truth.

You have to focus on the truth.

That actually, Ray?

Are you serious? lya.

This is not about the past
us, it's about this time.

What happened to this plane today.

Could happen in everywhere, now also

So they are all in heaven, the conclusions.

Without talking to anyone else outside of this plane.

You will follow the explanation that comes to your head.

I already knew this would come.

In all details

How is it possible

But the way it happened,
how they disappeared,

Even the way their clothes are still there.

The details are perfect.

How can he know that?

Think about it.

Why did not you think about this?

You lied to me about your wife,

Do you lie to your wife about this flight.

You even lied to his own daughter.

Seems that you can lie to everyone in your life,

and now you're asking me to seek God.

Hattie.

You do not understand.

You're here every day.

You work here, preaching here.

Not what counted.

What do you mean?

I know all the words, I could
cite all the chapters, but it was not enough.

You have to believe.

Believe?

Believe in what?

In God who killed my father?

God who took me from my mother and sisters of this world?
God who crashed the plane and destroyed the city?

He took them to protect them.

From what?

From the darkest period in the history of this world.

Murder, war...

And 7 years of darkness, they took him

And what we are all that's left?

What about me? What should I do?

This is not about what we do, it's about
requesting amnesty and surrender our lives...

Stop it!

God the mother I'm talking about,
will not ever do something like this.

Chloe, I beg...

Listen to me.

Dengarkanmu?

Why should I do that?

You do not even listen to yourself.

Are you okay Marshal?

Yes.

Good, I'm glad to hear it.

Peacon 257  This is the control tower

This is Peacon 257,
call control tower

257  This is
Peacon marcus, are you there?

Marcus, I'm 20 minutes outside of JFK,
I have to spin. Where are you?

You're a loss how many victims?

So it happens everywhere?

The whole planet friend

No one knows how many
, but millions

seems to be no way out.

What about my family?

I need you to call
Irene, make sure they are safe

How are you feeling?

Critical. I would be very lucky if achieving

Listen, all aircraft landing everywhere,
is not possible if you're landing at JFK

How Werdia Luke?

Sorry, Ray!

So where do I go?

You should land.

Marcus, I could not land

We'll let you know, when it's ready

It is not possible, you have to talk to them
. clear the way for us.

Marcus?

Marcus!

JFK tower, this Peacon 257, I'm in the emergency fuel shortages
, I need a foundation, I repeat, I need grounding.

So...

Is there a backup plan?

We do not have it.

We're not just a shortage of fuel, but gas as well.

JFK is the nearest airport, we
will be lucky to get there.

We only have one choice,

I hope they clean up the runway
and they do it quickly.

What about the sea? ./ I do not know.

We hit the water, I do not know what
this plane will survive.

We can not, we can not
harm these people.

Hey...

Are you okay?

You probably do not remember me,

In your father's office you sit at a table
yellow.

I remember thinking, this guy definitely
wants everything the best.

They have a small plastic table.

But when you're on the table, the table becomes a table
as the best among others.

Sometimes I also think like that.

Well...

At least he tried.

And I have a daughter too.

I mean, he's big now, he's married now
,

she never existed in my office desk.

To be honest, I was always too busy,

I hardly ever see him again.

You know, before all this happened, I
never even thought of him.

I wish I could say now that I do,
but I think about money, and jobs.

Maybe this is the best .

I'm sorry...

You know what he said about heaven
?

Although I really wanted to see it,

time I came home I
hope he was not there.

I need you to look for me.

I'm trying.

I'm sure this is uh... ended more fun than in the
plane.

I can understand that.

Jim to the tower, do you hear me?

We are leading towards the beach.

Our fuel is almost exhausted.

I need a path to a clean landing.

I repeat, I need
path to a clean landing.

Listen to me...

I control the plane with many passengers here.

I do not have nothing, not
no flag, no elevators.

And if this run correctly,
occurrence can not be repeated.

I need to refuel.

Oh...

Damn...

There reply?

He who controls consolenya.

What else? What can I say.

He turned.

I should not leave him today.

You do not know.

All I know, he came to meet me and I
go.

I left it alone.

Only God knows what he went through
down there.

He loves you, right? He will understand.

I can not let this be the last
thing for us.

I just can not.

I must tell the truth to him.

And I have to tell him that this is not the fault of his mother
, everything is my fault.

Every time I call God, I turned.

Mother...

I do not know if you can hear what is not...

But there is what I'm saying.

This morning
I feel we as a family will be destroyed.

And I blame you.

And I know that I hurt you.

Father, forgive me

I'm so sorry.

Hello?

Who is this? ./ Chloe...

This is Buck. / Thanks

Thank God, you're alive.

Where is my father?

He is here.

Chloe, honey, are you okay?

Dad...

I think you've died

Are you okay?

Yes, yes... I think so.

Mother and Raymie, they both disappear

I, I told you about this.

Yes, and he also had to tell me.

I love you very much.

I love you more than anything in this world.

I, father. I also...

I'm so sorry, I lied to you this
day and I'm not there with you today.

I just want you to know how much I love you
.

No matter what happens.

Well, dad... Why
do you talk like this?

What happened? Where are you?

Well... we still are in the air. We
the way, but there is a problem.

All electrical path outages...

What?

And I do not have enough fuel.

Chloe...

Dad...

Chloe...

The passengers...

We are entering the New York area.

Good...

All its airport closed.

And I want you to keep on kuris you

Fasten your seat belt,
and try to remain calm

But I have to be honest...

This is a very serious situation.

We talked on the tower controllers, and we
try to alternate landing area

But very little fuel us

Please note well our flight crew.

And if you believe
with the power of prayer.

Perhaps now is the time

Do you want to pray with me?

Yes, of course. Course.

No nothing.

Still not getting the signal.

Keep on trying.

I'll do it.

Well, now you have to put it down.

Put?

Where? ./ Aquatic...

But you said...

I know...

I want to fly in the JFK long as I could, but
I can not fly there without there are landing pads

This all happens in all airports

By flying there, it is impossible

We flew 4,000 times

JFK tower is 257 Peacon we need airstrip immediately

Continue to try

Well everything,
I need you to pay attention because we enter the emergency procedures.

I need you guys

Listen to instructions from the flight crew

JFK tower is Peacon 257, we need
emergency landing, now.

JFK tower. JFK tower is Peacon 257,
I need emergency landing now.

Come on...

right.

Buck, can you hear me?

Chloe

Biarakan I speak in speakers

I think I found a place where you can land
.

In the highlands in the west, there is a large
lane and I was cleaning the track.

Nothing is guiding us, we
can not land in the dark.

Hey, check your phone and open the application compass...

Well, wait a minute.

Well, I've got it.

Well, see the below screen is no sequence of numbers.
I need you to read it to me.

North West... 40.66.34 73.78.32

I got

Chloe, how long
path that we have a foundation?

Uh... There is about half a mile, father.

And there's more...

How much longer? I need at least 1 mile.

Well, wait a minute.

Chloe... Chloe, what are you still there?

Around 17:10

18...

Buck... Buck, can you hear me?

Hello?

Come

You've got to be kidding on me

Come on.

We need a vision or something,
so we can know when the landing would begin

you want me to sit here shortly
? ./ Yes... Yes...

Do not stop praying, and
all will be fine.

We're running out of fuel.

What?

Not.

This can still be used for landing
at least we should try to land

Or we will hit the ground quickly.
Is not nothing we can slow down, just brakes alone.

I need you to seek the best for us

Father...

Chloe...

Chloe...

About 9/10 mi. This is the longest track
I can try.

I mean 9/10 is enough?

But you need something
sign up so I could see the runway being

right.
I play my car lights, what do you see?

No, we were too far away for that, we need
bigger and brighter as a beacon

We ran out of time, I
have to land now.

Chloe...

I just need my lighter...

What we are going through there?

If no, I do not want him to think it was a mistake
he

This is it, we're going to land.

Did you see something?

No.... / Keep looking,
about 3 miles.

We only have one chance,
we must know when to start

Still nothing whatever

Come on darling

There!

Try opening wheels for landing.

Dad, you're going to hit me.

Oh...

We're home

All right, get out of the plane, now.
Come on, hurry.

We should fast. Let

Come...

You can get down, I beg
away from the path, / Come away

Hey, hey

Hey!

Buck.... / Chloe.

Thank you.

You've done an incredible job.

You also

I'm sorry.

I know.

Dad...

I should be there with you.

With the mother, and Remy.
I'm not supposed to leave you.

I'm quite happy you okay

I thought you might want to keep it.

Could this be the end of the world?

Not. Still yet.

I'm sure, is just the beginning
