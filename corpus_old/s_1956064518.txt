It's not mine.

It's not mine.

Confess, Billy.

It's not mine.

Look, this is mine.

That's mine. That's my top. That's my top.

This is definitely not mine, I swear to God.

That's not my shirt! That's...

No, that's fucking not mine!

If you don't have money, the Muslim guys...

Smash them.

They're not good for my business.

I'm not gonna beat up
some fucking Muslims, all right?

You're a boxer, man. Don't be scared.

I'm not fucking scared.
I don't give a fuck about that.

I'm not scared. I'll beat up everyone
in this fucking prison if I have to.

I'm saying to you I just need a hit now.

If you fucking give me a hit now,
I'll fucking do whatever you want, man.

I'll do whatever you fucking want.

They almost died.

I told you, just beat them,
not try to kill them.

Billy!

<i>Family visit...</i>

<i>for prisoner William Moore!</i>

You see me?

I'm happy to see you.

Are you okay?

I had a fight.

I won.

Number one.

I'm sorry to see you like this.

It's all right.

Take care...

Billy.

Stop!

Sit down!

Why don't you care about each other?

You eat together.

You sleep in the same room.

You do activities together.

Don't you have any sense of unity?

Prison is for men,

not for dogs!

Can't you speak to one another?

Why do you fight?

What is there to gain?

I'm here to train.

I want to train!

Go!

I'm a boxer. I can show you I can fight.

I need to fight.

Let me in.

Come on, just...

Just let me show you, all right?
Same, same. I'm a boxer.

Go!

Come on, man. Let me in.

Hey.

How are you?

Look, I'm sorry about not bringing
the cigarettes back.

I've had a fucking rough time.

And I was wondering maybe
if I could get some more cigarettes.

Join the boxing team.

I want to fight again.

Just give me this one chance
and I promise I'll pay you back.

I sear to God, Fame.

I'll prove to you.

I'll make it up to you.

I'll make it up to you.

Hey.

Hey.

I've got the cigarettes.

Your turn.

Okay.

You fight?

Boxing.
Oh, boxing.

I want to bet.

Cigarettes.

How many?
Two packs.

My fish won. Hey, two packs.

Cigarettes.
No.

My fucking fish won.
It wins every time.

My fish won.

Give me two packs of cigarettes.

I fucking won, man.

I fucking won.

Fucking...

The rule is the rule. He won.

No, boss. This prick is tricky.

Follow the rules. How much did he bet?

Hey.

It's from your girlfriend?

No, no, no. Fighting fish.

Okay.
I won a bet.

No girlfriend, no family.

No, no girlfriend.

I wanted to apologize, actually.

Because...

I lied to you about my dad.

Not having a family.

I've got a dad, I've got brothers.

They don't know I'm in prison.

It's okay.

Why are you in here anyway?

I killed my father.

Why?

He beat me.

He was not happy with who I am.

Sorry.

Put 'em up, man. Put 'em up.

Put 'em up!

Put 'em up.

William.

Just fucking do it.

See and decide.

You... No! Okay?

Again.

Strong.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey.

78.

Hey!

Fucking go!

Fucking go!

Your fight at Songkran was a fucking mess.

You will be transferred.

You're going to move to the boxing team cell

and share their privileges.

You're the first foreigner to compete
to qualify for national tournament.

Consider this an honor.

The tournament will take place
in another prison.

You have only two months to train.

If you don't want to represent
our prison, say now.

I can.

I want to fight.
Good.

Thank you, sir.

Wait.

From your father.

Thank you, sir.

William Moore.

See you later, man.
Look after yourself, all right?

When I was arrested,

I pleaded guilty for my girlfriend.

I got five years.

When I realized I was gonna
be in for five years,

I went wild.

I killed three people
in prison, stabbed them.

Three. Three people.

He killed three.

It's been 13 years now.

Seeing people leaving this prison
makes me want to go home.

So I joined the boxing team,
trying to be a better man.

You know what you get from being a boxer?

Your life inside here is better
than any regular prisoner's.

Sometimes, you can fight outside
and see your family.

Even if it's just for a few minutes,
it warms your heart.

Me...

South Thailand and Bangkok.

I killed...
Two people.

My family is poor,
so I decided to be a hitman.

Life sentence for a hitman.

William.

You...

No good.

You start here.

Okay?
All right.

Go, William.

Fame.

Fame.

Hey, sorry, I'm busy now.

I'm busy now, okay?

I'm not talking to you.

I'm not fucking talking to you!

I'm not fucking talking to you!

Come here!

I fucking want to know!
I want to fucking know!

Come over here. You're a fucking liar.

You're a fucking liar!

I said fucking hit me!

Fucking hit me.

Come on. Fucking hit me.

Come on. Fucking hit me, man.

Fucking hit me then, okay?

Fucking hit me!

Hey! Fucking hit me.

Hey!

Hey, I'm sorry, okay? I fucked up.

I made a mistake.
Sorry?

Look, I'm fucking sorry.

This song is about a woman

who is ready to wait forever
for the man she loves.

Okay. One more!

Hey, Billy.

Money!

I'm gonna get your money, all right?
I'm gonna get it.

I've got a fight coming up.
I'm gonna win, okay?

I'm gonna win. I'm gonna fight.
I'm gonna win, okay?

I'm gonna fucking win, all right?
I'm gonna fucking win, okay?

I'm gonna get the money for you,
all right? I'm gonna win the fight.

No.

I got AIDS. You want?

You lose...

I'm okay.

I've got to tell them I'm coming up.

It's all I've got.

The reason you have a rupture
is because of boxing

and the massive abuse of drugs and alcohol.

Any more trauma and frankly...

you could bleed to death.

Look, Mr. Moore.

I'm sorry.

I'll keep my guard up.

William Moore.

Okay.

Okay?

Billy!
Billy!

Billy!

Hello?

Hello?

William Moore.
