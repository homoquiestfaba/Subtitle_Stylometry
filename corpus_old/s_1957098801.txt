Well, let's see, he was in
charge of me,

my life, me.

But he comes up every once in a

just in my mind.

The name is very clear.

Sator, it was Sator, who

was in charge of everything.

MOTHER ON TAPE: All upon
the face of the forest,

shall tremble at his presence.

And the mountains shall be
thrown down.

For Sator's eyes are in every
place

on those who fear him,

On those who hope for his
kindness.

his acceptance.

Every beast of the forest,
(FOOD SIZZLING)

everything that moves is his.

Sator has made a covenant of
peace,

illuminating all harmful
beasts from this land.

And uses their flesh
(CAN CLACKS)

to cloak his disciples,

so that we may all live
securely in the wilderness

and sleep soundly in the woods.

We find you stranded

in a howling waste of a

We observe you.

We learn all about your ways.

And when the sun rises,

we withdraw and lie down in our

I don't know who you are?

Oh, hello.

Hi.
Hi.

Good to see you.
(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC)

Fred, Jack, Joe? (CHUCKLES)

You know, you know me.

No, I don't.
You know.

I don't recognize you. Why is
that?

I don't know.

It'll come to you.
Oh, I don't know why.

I just don't recognize
you for some reason.

PETE: I'm your grandson.

Well I thought so, but
you got a beard, you've grown

considerably since I last saw
you.

I was just here yesterday.

(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC)

Yesterday?
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

We had a good talk yesterday.

Who did?
Me and you.

How you've been sensing spirits.

NANI: I don't remember
yesterday.

PETE: Oh, that's okay.

What kind of things did...

What kind of things happen
around here

that are peculiar?

You sure that was yesterday?

PETE: I'm pretty
sure that was yesterday.

MANI: Well occasionally,
something happens.

Yeah.
Yeah?

NANI: Things are,
they'll be moved somewhere

from one place to another.
Yeah.

(CAMERA WHIRRING)

NANI: Yeah, and you know darn

you didn't do it yourself.

(GENTLE MUSIC)

(BOX SCRAPES)

Hey, where are you?

What are you doing?

What's going on with you?

You playing hide and go seek?

Who are you?
Okay.

Oh, my God.

(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC)

I used to do automatic writing,

and I was told what to write by
spirit.

PETE: It's implanted in your
brain?

Yeah.
And you just transfer it

from some other entity
that's telling you what

to write down

Yeah, it's that sort of thing.

Like my guardian

I have a guardian

that I, he, he's always there.

I always, he's gonna

just let me know something is
not right.

Mm-hmm.
If it's going to

be a good thing or something
I...

Sator is like a human being

that lives around here
somewhere.

Somebody who manages to get into
my brain

and talk to me. Knew everybody,

what they were saying and doing.

And he was aware of
everything that was done

and what should be done
and what has to be done,

what wasn't done.

How you people are this and
that.

Sator would help me, was
teaching me,

training me to be a person.

Every once in a while,
I just wake up in bed

and he's there.

He talks to me.

(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC)

It's interesting to have that
kind

of care. The talking in my head.

I have nothing to do with it.

It just starts, and I listen,

and if I'm supposed
to write it down.

I write it down or whatever.

I don't know.

People think you're nuts
if you tell them that.

PETE: Well I don't think
you're nuts.

Oh good, I hope not. (LAUGHS)

(CAMERA WHIRRING)

Although, when I feel
like wanting something

that I want to know about

(DOOR CREAKING)
or think about

or something, I just think about
it

and he comes in my brain,

or (LAUGHS) he manages to
(DOOR CREAKING)

make me aware of him,

talks to me and do, you know,

make me do some things and
stuff.

That was just a period of time.

Mm-hmm.
Then I went off

on my own way, I'd guess you'd
say.

I still wrote stuff.

What's that for?

NANI: I would hear
from him occasionally,

have something written to me.

When I've taken something

and tried to write on it,
Come on.

NANI: he gets in there

and telling me I should not be
saying

and doing what I was doing and
saying.

My dog ran off.

I'm sorry.

NANI: Things got so
complicated

and too many people involved.

Think something hurt him?
NANI: He still gets

a word in every once in a while

that I'm aware of.

Although he did, he talked to
James. Jimmy.

I'll keep an eye out.

NANI: I don't know any more.

Time has swallowed it all up.

PETE: Well that's
very interesting, Nani.

(NANI LAUGHS)

(WHIRRING)
I had voices.

I get messages,

and I still do in a sense.

And he comes to the house.

He comes here,

Sator does, often.

And just not in this particular
area

but out there where he
comes and stands around

and (LAUGHS) and just
watches what I'm doing

or whoever else is there, you
know,

he watches them.

And it still happens.

I still get messages from Sator.

PETE: Ugh, Sator can fuck
off, dude!

ADAM: I don't know
what else to do, dude,

and like, he's holding
Ma hostage somewhere

and doesn't want her to fucking
remember.

Goddammit.

(TRUCK WHIRRING)

I don't know, maybe, I think
I need a cigarette right now.

Seriously though, Brother.

trips me the fuck out what the
brain chooses

to hold on to.


PETE: Like helping
Grandpa Jim build his cabin.


I have this image really
fucking clear in my mind.

But then I found a photograph of
this,

and that's what I'm actually
seeing

is a damn photograph.


I don't remember that day at
all.

It's the same shit with Evie.

I have all these photographs,

but I can't remember her or the
accident.

And that shit was recent.

But we were fucked up
most of the time together.

So I guess that's different.

along the lines there,

I wanted to have something
going on in my life.

out was that in my head,

I was being told about things.

I was writing down stuff

Yes. That was sad.

(SOFT MUSIC)

He seemed to be involved

dying somewhere before,

that this is what he is
intending to do.

And he walked out of the house

and went out laid down in the

and we found him, and he died
there.

That's all I remember at this
time.

Yeah.
'Cause he died.

(SOFT MUSIC)

His death
caused Pete to get into

Oh my, yeah.

He's been in a home now for a

He gets out today.

Oh.
I get to pick him up.

Oh.

We have to show him how proud
we are of him.

been making to get better.

Can we visit him?

No.

I feel bad for just
leaving them up there.

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC)

Excuse me?

You feel bad because
you left him up there?

Did you even see how
it wasn't exactly safe

'Cause I don't remember
you making the decision

everyone because you didn't.

I left him out there.

Give me a goddamn break, Pete.

Doesn't anyone talk
to you in your head. (LAUGHS)

I don't know how to explain it.

It's just, it's been given to
me.

Sator will send messages
that land in my head.

And so do the other
people who if they want to

will just talk to me.

Right here, talking to me.

Like you now...

What is it that you need?

(NANI LAUGHS)

What do you want to know for
sure?

That Sator loves you?

That he cares about you?

That you're being good?

That you're not being good

about some things,

a little antagonistic,
at times.

Well, I don't know where this
comes from.

I find you quite well organized,

and take good care of me and
what's here.

And I get this voice saying,

and does what we tell you to.

Okay, your turn.

Any messages coming?
