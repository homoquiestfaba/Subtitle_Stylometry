( ''One Girl Revolution'')

I wear a disguise,
I'm just your average Jane

The super doesn't stand for model
but that doesn't mean I'm plain

If all you see is how I look,
you miss the super chick within

And I christen you ''Titanic, ''
underestimate and swim

And I'm a one-girl revolution
I'm a one-girl revolution

some stories that have to be told,

but I never realized
my memoirs would be one of them.

...that I wanna be
I am confidence and insecurity

I am a voice yet waiting to be heard

I'll shoot the shot bang
that you hear round the world

(all cheer)


Hey,

I caII it ''Dance of FamiIy.''

and I couIdn't have choreographed it
without my best friend KeIIy,

Yes! Oh!
Oh. Amanda. that was,,, that was fabuIous,

You know. I. um,,,

I was reaIIy abIe to sense the eternaI
struggIe of nature versus. um. nurture,

Sorry,
KeIIy. how's your famiIy project going?

Oh. weII,,,

Oh, Weren't you gonna write a short story?

WeII. that was before I was gonna do
the famiIy scuIpture garden,

Hi. Dad!

Oh,,, argh!


You know. I've decided to show the worId
the way the famiIy reaIIy works,

I've decided to caII it La Familia,
a fiIm by KeIIy CoIIins,

It's great,

Then over to Myanmar,

(Kelly laughs)

And then ThaiIand!

I'm gonna miss you. Dad,
Me. too. honey,

But I'II have my ceII phone on aII the time,

Dirty-water hot dogs!
Dad. I so need one,

Yeah. the best Manhattan has to offer,
Ooh,

Dad... my family.

Divorced, alone,
yet having a terrific time.

He knows he has me, the light of his life.

Ooh,,, oh. I gotta get you back, Taxi!

Taxi! Taxi!

See that?

I have to do everything.

(tires squeal)

(taxi driver) Hey!
(horns honking)

Ooh,,, ssss,

Mom - a worker, a mother.
She has me, the light of her life.

Can I caII you back? Soon,
Thank you, Bye-bye,

The generaI? Looks very important,
He is to me,

They are so cute together.
especiaIIy when he takes off the hat,

Ex-husband. ex-wife,
A nucIear famiIy that once expIoded,

But it expIoded as gentIy as possibIe,

KeIIy,,, KeIIy, No. KeIIy. KeIIy,

The water damage wasn't that bad,

And you know what? You managed
to save most of the fish,

I saved them aII.
because every fish's Iife is sacred,

Maybe if you sIow down just a IittIe bit,,,

Mom. Dad said you can't think about art,
It's something you feeI and just do,

WeII. your father is a grownup. sweetie,
Sometimes,

OK, I seriousIy promise you. no more

'Cause in case you haven't noticed.
I don't caII you anything but ''uh,''

''Uh.'' ''Joe.'' ''sir,'' Your choice,

Sir,,, How about Sir?

Mom and Sir, I Iike it,

And I just want you both to know
I am totaIIy.

totaIIy determined
to make this reIationship work.

but if you wanna be a part of our famiIy.

I wouIdn't be getting married if I thought
that it wasn't gonna be good for both of us.

Oh. KeIIy. I Iove him,

Love,,, Wow, I hear it's great,

Try not to crush my wedding gown,
Don't worry. I got it. I got it,

Ha-ha,

One he's aIways wanted,

Hm? Good, Because
I've been Iooking in the want ads,

Nobody seems to be Iooking
for a retired generaI,

So. what's he gonna do?
Some things are gonna change. hon,

Like I'm gonna be doing a Iot Iess editing,
We'II be moving upstate,

I'm gonna Iearn how do to things Iike
make curtains and maybe even cook,

Cook? Whoa,
I think you shouId take it sIow. Mom,

Did you say moving?

What? Yes. to a pIace that has no takeout,

But you know what? It's gonna be fine,

It's gonna be great, ReaIIy,
It's gonna be fine,

Moving? Mom. we can't be moving
out of New York,

Where wiII I get my dirty-water hot dogs?
Oh. do you want one?

No,

KeIIy. I promise that
we'II drive into the city a Iot,

A Iot? We can't move so far away
that I can't commute to my schooI,

They have a wonderfuI schooI
where we're going,

But I Iove my schooI. Mom, I Iove it,

This new schooI has very high standards,
The academics are great,

How do you know.
and I mean reaIIy know?

WeII. I know. KeI. because Joe is gonna
be the principaI. onIy more so,

Mom. in what way more so?

WeII. he's more than just a principaI,
He's Iike a,,, a commandant,

A what?

And it's a very caring. very structured
which wiII be good for you -

miIitary schooI,

MiIitary schooI? Uh. no. no,

Like where they wear uniforms
and they march aII around together?

You can't do this to me. Mom,
I'm not going,

KeIIy. we are gonna be a famiIy.
and famiIies Iive together,

I mean. the house is right on the campus,
You'II be coming home every weekend,

How about if you two go and I stay here?
You can come and visit anytime you want,

I don't think so,
What about if I move in with Amanda?

Her parents won't even notice,

KeIIy. you're much too much fun
to Ieave behind,

And you know what?
FamiIies don't Ieave anyone behind,

Yeah. but,,,

I'm not going!

Promise we'II be best friends
aIways and forever,

I promise, Anyway. I'm not going,

And promise you won't Iike it more there
than you Iike it here,

No chance of that,
They wear uniforms,

They go to a schooI where they Iearn
about miIitary strategy, They sit in desks,


No!
Yes!

WeII. it doesn't matter,
Because I'm not going,

I'm not going, I am not going,

(man, over PA) Welcome to
the George Washington Military Academy.

(continues indistinct)

,,,1 8. 1 9. 20,,,

I don't know but I've been toId


 Streets in heaven are paved with goId
 Streets in heaven are paved with goId

Where can I get a cafe mocha?


three,,, four,,,

I could not believe
that this was the man we married.

Sir looked a whole lot different
standing there

than when he was kissing my mother
in our living room.

HeIIo, I'm CarIa,

KeIIy, Nice to meet you,

You're gonna Iike it here. you know,
I can't beIieve I have to sIeep in a pIace

without a singIe decent piece of art
on the waIIs,

Yuck, We got Captain Stone again,
You know. she's going to dismember us,

Who's this Captain Stone anyway?

Just the meanest 1 6-year-oId in America,
She's our squad Ieader,

She's the one who teIIs us
what to do and when to do it,

That can't be possibIe, We've got brains,
We are thinking peopIe,

Not around her. you're not,
I hear she's got a buzzard for a pet,

She's probabIy gonna be going
with Brad again this year,

Brad? What's a Brad?

He's the best-Iooking.
most perfect boy around,

And he goes to schooI here?
Why not me?

As if a cadet major wouId
be interested in any of you guys,


I wouIdn't do that if I were you,
It's not reguIation,

It's just a bIanket,
It's not Iike anyone's gonna see it but us,

Everything here is by the book,
Thanks for the warning. CarIa.

but I'd reaIIy Iike to try and retain
my individuaIity around here,


I'm sorry, Did I accidentaIIy snatch
this ratty oId thing away from you?

In my experience. peopIe don't snatch
accidentaIIy, And it's not ratty!

It is now,
And keep it out of my barracks!

Why wouId you do something Iike that?

Oh! My bad,
You must be Captain Stone,

Hmm, You're on my Iist,,, maggot,

You'd be on mine if I had a Iist,

I'II pretend that you didn't say that,

As you were,

Ooh! TroubIe ahead. girI,

WeII. there'II be troubIe ahead for her. too,

You don't get it, In her mind.
you're just a IowIy speck of dust,

WeII. that's not how I see it. OK?

We may be in miIitary schooI.
but we stiII Iive in a democracy,

Some things are just gonna have
to change around here,

You're gonna change a schooI
that's been around for a hundred years?

I don't think so,
My advice - don't cross Jennifer,

I hated it - the uniformity, the rules,

the khaki of it all.

It was totally clear to me
that George Washington Military Academy

needed to become a kinder, gentler
school, and it was up to me to do it.

I have to do everything.

(female cadet) Lights out! Ten minutes!

What?

Excuse me,
My mom Iets me stay up tiII midnight!


( ''Reveille'')

(female cadet) Let's go. Iet's go!
Ladies. roII out of those racks!

Inspection's at 0800 hours,
Let's go! Move!

Come on! Out of those racks now!



You wiII adhere to the foIIowing scheduIe,
Am I understood?

Sir. yes. sir!

ReveiIIe at 0600 hours!

First mess 0645!

None of this made sense.
There were 2 4 hours in a day, not 600.

And why, after cleaning,
would you make a mess? (scoffs)

You again,
Everything cIear. maggot?

WeII. now that you ask.
my watch onIy has 1 2 hours on it,

You get dumber by the minute. don't you?

That is aII,

You're forgetting something. maggot,

What?

Oh!

Now. who wouId put that there?

Ma'am. permission to speak. ma'am,
It's about the maggot. ma'am,

Ma'am. this cadet voIunteers
to teach the maggot

miIitary protocoI and terminoIogy. ma'am,

Do it, Fast!

And teII her about the crocodiIe I wrestIed,

First Iesson: zip it and Iisten,

Two things I have never mastered,

Everybody has a rank,
BasicaIIy. you saIute officers,

I've heard of generaIs,

Uh. weII. you can teII a person's rank
by Iooking at their chevrons or insignia,

Oh. Sergeant. Major!

Sergeant Major, Hi,

I'm guessing. but nobody seems to mind,
Hey,

Hey. hey. hey, Stone. Stone,

AII right. there he is,

How's my hair?
Perfect,,, as usuaI,

Whoa. is that Brad?

Or the cutest boy I've ever seen?
Or both?


Oh. my gosh. he Iooks just Iike a rock star,

And I wouId know.
because I've been this cIose to NSync,

Better stay away,
He's the Stone's man,

And you'II be seeing them together
at the WeIcome Back dance on Friday,

Did you say dance?
Yeah,

We're invited too, Everybody's invited,
Do we get to wear reaI cIothes?

Wear 'em if you got 'em,

HaIt!
I am so there,

Dismissed!

OK. so I'm gonna casuaIIy bump into him

and just bring up
the WeIcome Back dance,

Yes. ma'am,
AII right,

Hair is good?
Yes. ma'am,

Good,


(boy) What was that aII about?
(Brad) I have no idea,

(clears throat)

I thought she'd be happy
about how quickIy I was Iearning,

Oh,

It was here. just south of Mont-Saint-Jean
that NapoIeon fooIishIy tried to spIit

the combined forces of WeIIington and
BIucher, Now. the resuIt of this was that,,,

Can this wait?
WeII,,,

it wouId be dishonest of me not to teII you
right now that I'm a conscientious objector,

I don't think I got anything right,
It's just a test to gauge your IeveI,

I don't think I've hit a IeveI yet,

At my oId schooI. we onIy had to do math
when we feIt Iike it,

It was a reaIIy good system, We didn't have
to sit whiIe we were doing it. either,

Hey. whatcha got?
Oh. nothing,

Just my dress for Friday night,

Let me see,
Oh. my gosh. it's so beautifuI,

You wanna see mine?
Yeah. yeah!

Let me see,

Is this yours?
It's such a great coIor,

Oh. great,

The driII team's a big deaI,
It's Iike our arms footbaII team,

You know. miIitary Iife may be
for some peopIe. but it's just not for me,

It's something you have to adjust to,

PeopIe Iike Jennifer are used to it,
Both her parents are army,

Commandant coming,
There's dust on those boots,

At ease. Cadets,
Where are you young Iadies going?

Home. to pick out some dresses
for the dance Friday night,

Sir,

Be sure to pick out some nice ones,
Carry on. Cadets,

We wiII, See ya. Joe,

You cannot taIk to the commandant
Iike that,

WeII. I sort of can,

You see. he's my stepdad,
He and my mom met at a wedding.

and they Iiked it so much.
they decided to have one of their own,

You shouId teII Jennifer,
She wouId go way easier on you,

That's a negative, She's my own battIe,

Come on!
I,,, I,,

It's OK,

( ''I Need To Hear It From You'')

You shouId pick first,
They're yours,

Oh. no, It's so much more fun for me
if you go first,

There she is! Hi. baby!
Hey. Mom,

One of the great things about Mom
is she always greets you

like you've been gone for three years.

So? How's schooI?
It's,,, very niceIy structured,

Mom. this is CarIa,
Hi. CarIa, Nice to meet you,

Hi, Nice to meet you,

It's fabuIous. so ten-minutes-from-now,

You know. girIs. Iunch is aImost ready.

to miIitary Iife,

Argh!

Oh!

Mama's not here to hoId your hands,
Let's go. peopIe! Move it!

Let me see those knees up. up. up!

Come on. come on. come on!

I'd Iike to see you skip that,

That's right - if I did. you wouId've
had to faII back and do it again,

(male cadet) That's right,
That's right, Come on!

This is not a tea party!
(Jennifer) Let's go! Up. up. up. up. up!

Get down here right now. you maggot!

So. what are you gonna do when a
member of your team is counting on you?

You're gonna Ieave a man behind?
No! You're gonna rappeI down that rope

and you're gonna get him!
No one gets Ieft behind! Is that cIear?

I hate heights,
I'm even hoping not to get too taII,

HeIIo! I faII even
when I'm just waIking around!

Atten-hut!

Is anyone eIse out there?
(all) Sir. no. sir!

WeII done, The WeIcome Back dance
begins at 1 900 hours,

Dismiss your squads,

Dismissed!

Um,,, I'm getting a IittIe hungry,

Ooh. how about sending for some Caesar
saIad with a IittIe bit of Cajun chicken.

a touch of ciIantro and a IittIe bit
of Iemon dressing on the side.

with some of those oyster crackers?

Yummy,

Fine,

Oh!

Mommy!

Whoo,

Sergeant Ramos wiII take over from here,

You're gonna do this course
untiI you get it right,

But what about the dance?

Hmm. uh. you're not gonna be there,
Are you sure you're aIIowed to do that?

What are you gonna do about it?
TeII your stepfather?

Hmm?

I'II teII you what I'm gonna do about it,
What?

AbsoIuteIy nothing,,, ma'am,

Maggot,

Ten-hut!

Back up! Let's go! Onto the tires!

Go quick! And pick your feet up!

Oh! This is just great!

Why me?
Let's go!

Sergeant Gloria Ramos,
my own private slave driver, was tough,

but she didn't have
Jennifer's 1 00 percent look of hatred.

I decided to try and find the real Gloria,
the one who was craving to be human.

I'm sorry you have to stand over me
Iike this and miss the dance,

I don't dance,
Don't you wanna Iisten to the music?

I hate music,
Nobody hates music,

It's a primitive instinct which I'm sure
you couId unIeash any time you want,

Never happened,

We have got to get to the bottom
of your deniaI,

Get moving!
I intend to,

I can diagnose and cIimb at the same time,

Under the wire. Cadet!

Ow! Ah!

Your arm is bIeeding!
Oh. that's what that sticky red stuff is!

How do you feeI?
I don't feeI! I just wanna finish!

I'm gonna do this.
and it's gonna be my personaI best!

EspeciaIIy since
I've never done this before,

From the haIIs of Montezuma.
to the shores of TripoIi

That's the Marines!

How about,,,
Row. row. row your boat. gentIy,,,

Ah! That's the Navy,

I don't think I'II ever be abIe to do this,

Back home in Ponce.
we have the most beautifuI stars,

When I'm crawIing in the mud here.
I pretend I am there.

on the beach.
and the sand is soft and warm,

Oh. GIoria. that is pure poetry,

Let me show you, Use your eIbows,

It gives you more stabiIity
and heIps you get there faster,

Use your knees to push,

Then. when you have
to get under some wire.

fIatten yourseIf out compIeteIy. Iike this,

Ready?
Yeah,

Go!

I'm doing it!

It stopped raining!
Thanks. GIoria,

Maggot!

(girl #2) Way to go. KeIIy!

WeII. at Ieast somebody knows
how to get down and dirty,

It would've been so cool
if Sir had invited me to his office...

under any other circumstances.

As you know. my father was
commandant of this academy.

so I understand the position you're in,

He was harder on me than the others
just to prove he was fair,

You know. in those days.
peopIe didn't understand

how fragiIe a chiId's psyche couId be,

Don't worry. sir,
You'II put it behind you someday,

I am not happy about your performance
your first week here,

I'm not exactIy happy with what's going on.
either, Things couId be much better,

Did you know that there's this whoIe group
who practice throwing around rifIes?

They're Iike robots or something,

I was one of those robots
when I was in schooI here,

It's OK, You were young,
You didn't know any better,

Captain Stone says that you purposefuIIy
damaged her personaI beIongings

in the form of a white dress.
which you wiIIfuIIy Iaid your hands on,

It was not purposefuIIy,,,
or wiIIfuIIy. sir,

I Iost my footing approaching the dance.
and I accidentaIIy,,,

Captain Stone isn't the onIy one
that I've had compIaints from,

Your teachers are finding
your Iack of discipIine,,,

probIematic. to say the Ieast,

It's time that you Iearn
how we operate around here,

Uniformity is something we strive for,

Are you sure that's a good thing?
I'm positive,

AIthough individuaI dignity is respected.
the individuaI is at the service of the group,

That's why we caII it the service,

That's a Iesson you need to Iearn.
Private CoIIins. and you wiII Iearn it,

Dismissed,

AII right, It's time for you to go home,
TeII your mother I'II be there shortIy,

You have reached Adam Collins.
Please leave a message.

I just caIIed to say hi,

There's absoIuteIy nothing to worry about.
even though I'm kinda miserabIe,

It's because I'm aIIergic to the country,

OK. I gotta go, Bye,

I had given George Washington
a whole week,

and it seemed that it and I
would never get along.

I had to tell Mom,
''I don't wanna stay here. ''

Mom. can I have your Iap?
I need to teII you something,

OK, 'Cause I have something
to teII you too,

You can go first,
OK,

Uh. KeIIy. uh,,, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it. OK?

We're gonna have a baby,

A ba,,, a baby?
Yeah,

A baby?
A baby,

Wow. a baby,

You know. KeI.
I wiII stiII Iove you 1 00 percent,

And I'm sure I'm gonna Iove this baby.
but I wiII aIways Iove you Ionger,

Me too. Mom,
I wiII aIways Iove you Ionger,

OK, (clears throat)

Ta-da!

The baby's room is gonna need those
beautifuI paintings you do so weII,

Oh. I Iove it
when you use psychoIogy on me,

Mom. you have made me
a very happy daughter,

Good,
Now. what were you gonna teII me?

Me? Um,,,

I,,, I was going to teII you that. um.
CarIa's turned out to be a very good friend,

I couldn't tell her I wanted to quit school.

We couldn't bring a baby into this world
among even one ounce of chaos.

HeIIo,
Hi,

How are ya?
Good,

Yeah,

CongratuIations,,,

big sister,


Suddenly, it dawned on me
that Sir wasn't ready to be a father yet.

List of things to do.: give Mom
total support, woman-to-woman,:

help Sir understand his new fatherly role,:

and try to convince the military
to let people use their own blankets.

I had to do everything.

( ''Reveille'')



WeII. I know there has to be
something wrong here,

Ma'am. no. ma'am,

WeII,,,

you got away with it this time -
whatever ''it'' is,

(Jennifer sighs)

You know,,,

I do beIieve that I said something

Oh. yeah, That I never wanted to see it

Hmm,

Sweet dreams. maggot,

ShaII we get a Iawyer?
The cadets run these things themseIves,

I review the verdict
and mete out the punishment,

Oh. honey. that puts you
in such a difficuIt position,

So you know what? Don't go too easy
on her, But maybe not too hard. either,

This is the job I've wanted aII my Iife,
Ever since I was a kid here,

Listening to my dad. watching him.
Iiving in this house, I can't bIow it,

And you think one IittIe girI
is gonna make that happen?

I didn't,,,

I think I'm gonna take a waIk,

Joe,,,

I'm sorry. Mom, I didn't mean to,

OK,

I hereby sentence you to,,,

The driII team?
Sir. I'm not reaIIy good at being on teams,

I'm more of a soIo artist,

you to be equipment manager,

You're expected to keep the uniforms
orderIy: poIish boots and brass:

maintain rifIes. guidons.

WeII. I just caIIed to teII you that,
Oh, OK. honey,

And. uh,,, what might those be?

We have a baby to raise. sir, And frankIy.

They have to be smiIed at constantIy.

That-that-that,,, this is my soIo,

I don't even remember what I did,

Anyway. it doesn't even matter,
I mean. there was fire. spirit,

Our team couId use a IittIe more of that,
Do it again - it was good,

The BattIe of the Choisin Reservoir
in the frigid winter of 1 950-51

was not a retreat
but an advance to the rear,

One of the greatest strategic
rescue operations in miIitary history.

even if it was the Marines,

So. advancing to the rear is a good thing,
In this case. an exceIIent thing,

The 1 st Division stayed together.
worked together and survived together,

Wow. It continued to amaze me

that the stuff you learn in military school
could actually apply to real life.

I suddenly understood why it was
important to stomach Jennifer.

Hi,

Uh,,, I mean. ma'am. hi. ma'am,

together. there's no teIIing what,,,

ActuaIIy. there's not gonna be
a next year for me,

You see. my father got transferred
to Europe. so. uh,,, I'm moving,

But I do have one wish for you. Cadet,

That you become a pIatoon Ieader,,,

and have to deaI with a IittIe maggot,,,
just Iike you,


Forward,,, hup!

Right face!

Stop!

Left face!

Present arms!

Spin order,,, arms!

Since this is my first autobiography,
I might not have gotten everything right.

The events are true,
the feelings are genuine,

and my memoirs are finished.

But I might have forgotten
what everyone was wearing.
