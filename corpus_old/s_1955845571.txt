[reporter on radio

<i> In other news,</i>

Â¶

[Christen laughing]

What'd you get me?

What did I get you?
Yeah, what'd you get me?

You'll see.
Is it lacy and frilly?

[Christen laughs]

I'm intrigued.


[Tyler sighs]

Â¶

Do you know how you always
leave your stuff
in my bathroom?

Yeah, you hate it.

Do you know
why I hate it?

Because it's girls' stuff
and it's not
a girl's bathroom.

[scoffs]
But it could be.

[engine revs]

We should talk
about it.

We should<i> talk </i>
about it...

After this long,
completely avoiding
the subject.

Sure.

Seriously?

Seriously.

Deal?

[laughs] Deal.
Hey?

Yeah?
Shake.

All right.
Deal.

Pleasure doing
business with you.

Nice doing business
with you.

Â¶


[Christen laughs]

[chatter and laughing]

[Tabby] Big brother!
Hi.

Hi! You look great.

He really cleans up,
doesn't he?
Yeah!

Finally!
Birthday boy! Hey!

Happy birthday! Oh.
[laughing]

Yeah! Hey, there he is.
Sorry, everyone.

My fault.

My keen instinct told me
you would all be here,

so naturally
I had to change

to dress down
to your level.
[laughing]

Ha ha.
So selfless, even
on your birthday.

You're welcome.
Yeah.

Well, we've been
celebrating
without you.

Mm.
Mm. Hey, bud,
one more bottle.

My wife ordered
for you already. Halibut.

Prime filet. Rare.

Hmm. [clears throat]

Crab.
Yes.

Burger with side
of Brussels.
Mm-hmm.

Chicken<i> piccata.</i>

Salmon, no mushrooms.

And Hadlee.

Says she's filled up
on bread,

but ends up picking
at everyone else's food.


I thought we'd all
like to share.

Are we really
that predictable?

Not predictable--

committed.
Mm.

Insane people
are committed,

or sell art at my gallery.

We are steadfast.

Or stubborn.


How does it feel
to be old?

I asked him
the same thing.

How old am I again?
You're old.


Old enough to know
what you want.

What do you want
for your birthday?

A toast.
Yes, a toast.

To my--
No, not your toast.

It's not your toast.
[laughing]

It's okay.
I'm still drinking.


I thought it was
just a silly clichÃ©,

but you are living proof

that things really
do get better with age.

[scoffing]
Okay, okay.

Okay. Babe?

I'm so thankful to celebrate
your birthday with you,

and I'm looking forward
to many, many more.

Hey, sweet.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Cheers.

Mm.

Oh!
What's this?

I thought no presents
'til tomorrow's brunch.

Yeah.

I guess we're not all
predictable after all.

You guys got him presents?

Yeah, it's his birthday.

[chattering and laughter]

What?

Escape room?
Yep.

Yeah.
What is that?

You're locked in a room

until you solve a series
of puzzles to get out.

And you've only got
one hour.

No, that sounds horrible.

That sounds really fun.

I've heard
it's the latest craze.

Remember that, um,
secret mask thing,

the<i> Macbeth</i> thing
in New York last year?

That wasn't
an escape room.
I know.

I'm just saying
it's the latest
underground thing.

They're popping up
everywhere.

I think Shakespeare
in any form is
so fucking boring.

Yeah.
I agree with you.

This won't be.
I promise.

What happens if we don't
figure it out in time?

We're trapped.

Forever.


It's a challenge.
A test of intelligence.

Hmm.

All right, I'm in.
Where is this room?

The mystery
is part of the game.

Ooo, exciting!
So how do we get there?

I've arranged everything.

I just need you
to play along.

How did<i> you...</i>
Oh!

... come up with something
so adventurous?

Excuse me! What,
are you surprised?

Very surprised.

Good. Happy birthday.

Let's get drunk.
[laughing]

Â¶

Really, it's not necessary.
No, I'm just kidding.

[overlapping chatter]

This is us.

Oh!
Oooh!

This is how to party.
Yes.

Damn.
I want to come.

Babe, we were so specific
about reservations.
[groans]

If we could ever
get ahold of you...

Ugh, I'm so unlucky.

No, honey, you're
just a wild card.

Goodbye.
[Conrad] Come on,
beautiful.

[Tabby squeals]

It won't be the same
without you, kid.

At least I already
have plans.

Do you want me
to call you a cab?

I'll get a ride.
You guys have fun.

How you gonna get home?
Oh, I'm not going home.

This girl's got
a sexy party to go to.

[laughs]
Sexy party.

Ay, ay!

Trouble.
Yeah.

[chatter, glass clinking]

Oh, my God,
that's good.

Look at the--
Oh, look who decided
to come in!

[indistinct greetings]

Hey, buddy,
there you are!

What's up?
Happy birthday, man!

Happy birthday!
[van door closes]

[music playing]
[laughter]

I love this stuff.
I know.

This is amazing.
Thank you.

Oh, don't thank me yet.


[Natasha] Oh, come on.
Okay, guys.

Gonna need
your cell phones, please.

[clears throat]

Hell no.
[laughter]


Can't have you
looking up how
to solve a puzzle.

No help from anyone.

Uh...


There's no lifelines
in this game?

Come on!
No.

For an hour?

Come on,
what's the big deal?

As birthday ambassador,

I order all of you
to relinquish your phones.

Thank you.

Hey, you know what?
Fuck it.

Hand 'em over.
Here you go.

Thank you.
Here.

As you wish,
birthday ambassador.


What?
It's everyone or no one.


Proud of you, Anderson.

Fuck off.
[laughing]

Ouch.
Why is he so mean to me?

I love him and he's
so mean to me.

All right, guys, I'm also
going to need your wallets,

your purses, anything else
in your pockets.

Fuck.
[whistles]

All you can take with you
are your wits.

And there's insurance
on this game and all,
right?

I take full responsibility
for everything.
Okay.

Thank you, Conrad.
You're welcome.

All righty. Got it?
[Tabby] Nice.


[sigh]
Happy birthday.

[music playing]
Yeah!

Whoo!

Â¶

[ice rattles]

[bottle clatters]

Does anybody know
how long we've been
driving for?

How could we,
when we can't see
anything?

ask the driver.


Maybe it's not
supposed to open.

It's all part of it.

Christen, how'd you
find this place?

They're everywhere.
Hiding in plain sight.

What, is there
an escape room app?

You just tap
and sign up? What?

[laughs] The Uber
of entrapment games?
[Conrad laughs]

No, no app. No nothing
on the Internet.

Well, then
how'd you find it?

I got this.

What is<i> that?</i>

An invitation.


It's cute.

Yeah, but the question
is, who sent it?

I don't know.

But I know with all the research
I've been doing on escape rooms,

my name got on some list,

and this ended up
in my mailbox.

It's Morse code.

It spells G-A-M-E.

Game.

[beeps]
Oh!


[Conrad] What?
Oh.

Huh.


All right,
that is cool.

Yeah, that's awesome.

Legit.

[laughing]
[electricity buzzes]

[rattling noises]

Oh. [chuckles]

Oh, what the fuck
was that?

We're here.

[unzips bag]


You've got to be kidding me.

It's all part of the game.


Well, I'm too buzzed
to care at this point
anyway, so...

I'm so nervous.
I got this, babe.

Ugh.

I'm so ready.

All right. Let's do this.

There's a team player.
[Conrad] Whoo-hoo!

Ow! Ha ha!
Lock hands, everyone.

I don't want to lose you
when I lead you out.

[laughing]
[Tabby] Whoo!

This is awesome.

[laughter]
Whoo-hoo!

You're not wearing one?

Somebody's got to be
in charge.

Isn't that cheating?


Â¶

But it's all part of the game.

[door slides open]

[Conrad, whispering]
This is crazy.
[laughing]

Where's your hand, Tabby?

are on my ass.

[Conrad] That's exactly right.
[laughing]

[Tyler] Jesus!
[Christen] Okay,
is everyone ready?


where's your hand?

[Tyler] I'm--
I'm right here.
[thudding]

Jesus!
[Anderson] Well,
that sounds safe.

Don't touch your blindfolds.

[Conrad] She swat me
like a dog?
Yes, I did. You know what?

If you behaved,
I wouldn't have to.


[indistinct whispering]

right now.


You have one hour.

Â¶

[distant chatter]

[distant door closes]

[door slams shut]


Â¶




[electricity snaps]
Ow!

[electricity hums]
[machinery powering up]

[clocks ticking]

Christen?

<i> What the fuck is this?</i>


All right. All right.


All right.

Well, um...

[Anderson grunts] ...three.
Are you done yet?

What are you talking about?
I'm talking to Christen.

She's tying something
to my hands.

Yeah, she tied something
to my wrists, too.

this thing off.

[sing-song]
You're not playing
the game right.

[sighs]
<i> - Â¶ And down beside the sea Â¶</i>

All right.

That's... You're just

Okay.
No, that's...

Fuck.

Conrad?


Wha-- anybody?

Boo!
[gasps]

[laughs]
Oh, my God, you scared me!

Oh, mission accomplished.

Mm. You're so bad.

Aw, you like it.

Yeah, I do.
[laughs]

Whoa.

Okay, this is weird.

This is sick.

This is weird.

What is<i> this?</i>

Um, I don't know,

but can we do something
about this first?


Okay. [laughs]

Oh, my God.
What is this?

I don't know. I thought
it was you grabbing me

and I kind of liked it.

I was blindfolded,
Conrad.

How would I have put
this on you?

<i> God, I can't believe</i>
<i> Christen did this.</i>



Really? [laughs]




All right. Um...

["Pack Up Your Troubles
In Your Old Kit Bag" playing]

Okay, how 'bout--

how about if I do...
No.

Okay, let's--
Just stop, Anderson.


I'm trying
to figure this out.

Yeah, well,
it's obviously
not working.

It's a fucking puzzle.
There must be
another solution.

Like what?

We have to work
together, okay?

Fine.


Okay, what did we do
before that
hasn't worked?

Like, we need
to rethink this thing.

Well, we can't untie it.
We can't go around
each other.

How about
if we go through it?

Through it?

Yeah, like this.
Like through it.
Like through.

<i> Like this.</i>
<i> Like through.</i>

What? No, that's
not right.
Yeah.

Oh, no, no, no.
You were definitely
on to something here.

Okay, you put
your hand here.

What's the number?

Tabby, it's part of the game.
You gotta figure it out.

a reason they put

this horrible thing
on you?

Yeah, it's a clue.

All right, so we have
to figure out a number

that relates to the worst
pair of underwear ever.

Yes, we do.

[laughs]

Yeah. Let's do that.

<i> So there are</i>
<i> four numbers.</i>

<i> Let's</i>
<i> assume</i>
<i> A is one, B is two,</i>
<i> and A-B-C.</i>

You can't go higher than nine.
[Tabby] This is complicated.

All right, babe,
let's brainstorm.

Why would I be wearing
this belt?

Mm... sex is definitely
out of the question.

I think you nailed it.

I'm definitely
not nailing you.

No, babe, what's
a four letter word

that has to do with sex?

"Fuck?"

Uh-uh.

That's
too many digits.

"Kink?"

Oh, wait!
What about head?

Okay, maybe we can
talk about<i> that </i>
after we're done with this.

No, babe,
that's the answer.

Oh.


Okay, so H.
So... H, so eight.


So E...
Babe.

Yeah?
Five.

All right.

A is one. Okay.

And D... Fuck.
Four.


Â¶

Ah!
Yeah!

<i> - [laughs]</i>
<i> - Oh!</i>

[Tabby]<i> We did it.</i>
<i> - Yeah, we did.</i>
<i>   Now, I'm gonna do it.</i>

<i> - [laughs] </i>
[Tabby]<i> Oh, I like it.</i>



Â¶

Ah!
Anderson.

Fuck! Tyler?

[music playing]
You all right?

Yeah, the fucking thing
cut me in the finger
when it opened.

Is Natasha with you?
I'm right here.

[Anderson]
Is Christen with you?
No, I'm alone.

Oh, that sucks.

Is there a knob on your side?

Um... no.

Just a latch
to this compartment.

you're knobless as well?

Just a combination dial.

What's the story
in that room?

I don't know.

Thought it was decorated
by a bipolar novelist.

Oh.
Where are you?

My room is filled
with antique televisions

and out of sync clocks,
too many to count.

Ah. Aside from some
Davy Crockett shit,

we have clocks
in here, too.
Huh.

[liquid sloshes]

Uh, they don't seem
to be working, though.

How many are there?

Four.

And all of them are stopped?
Looks like it.

They're all stopped
on an hour.

Okay, are they all stopped
on different hours?

Yes.

Okay. Tell me the times
on the clocks.

Uh, 12 and six,

five, and eight.


Damn it. [sighs]

Â¶

Okay, where are the clocks?

I don't know.
All over the room.

What?

There are two
on the left hand
side of the door

and two on the other.

All right, of the clocks
on the left,

what is the time
on the one furthest
from the door?

Uh, 12.


And the first clock
on the right hand side?

Uh, five.

Second one on the left?

Six.

And the last one
on the right.

And eight.

Shit.
[Natasha sighs]

You did it. [laughs]

No problem.

Wow, fashionable.
Yeah.

We'll see.

Â¶

Guys.


All right.

It works. [laughs]

[cuff clicks]
[sighs]

[key clatters]
[snorts, laughs]

Hey, there's a card here.

Wonder what
it's doing there.

Is it a piece to a puzzle?
I don't know.

Yeah...

[Natasha sighs]

Is this-- Is this
how you took it out?

Now what?

Yikes.

Exactly.

Well, the only way out
is the exit door,

which I assume will open
when we win.

<i> If</i> we win.

Anderson. Come on.

We just killed
that first puzzle
without breaking a sweat.

Don't you want to win?

We're going to get
out of here in record time.
Just get on board.

All right. Lead the way,
birthday boy.

But how do you suspect
we're gonna find the others
if there are no doors?

It's all gotta be
part of the game.

Â¶

What are you looking for?
I don't know.

[laughs]
That narrows it down.

Oh, come on, Anderson.

There has to be something
that leads to the next thing.

You know, like a clue?

Oh, really?

So do you mind
enlightening me, then?

All right.


Okay, well,
how about these?

They're a series
of animal paintings
in a line.

So what?

So it could be a clue!
I don't know.

Yes!
[music playing]


I bet it's based on weight.
Take those off.

Oh, yeah.

It's the food chain.

Brilliant.
Trade me.

Rabbit.

Fox.
Coyote.

[machinery whirring]
Whoa. What?

[Natasha laughs]


Seriously?

Slackers.

Typical.

Hi. Oh, yeah?

You guys busy?
[Natasha] Hmm?

We can't hear you.

We can't hear you.

We... we can't
hear you.

Oh, my God.

It's like he doesn't know
it's my sister.


Hey, where do you think
that door leads to?

Well, it looks
like it's connected
to the other room.

But there is no door
in the other room.

I<i> know</i> that,

but you're telling me
that doesn't look
like it's connected?

Oh, it's definitely
connected.

Â¶

What're you doing?


Oh!
Whoa!


Ah. [grunts]

Oh, so there<i> was</i> a door.

Here.


Thank you.
You're welcome.

All right, let's
get rid of these clocks.

Okay, so where's the key?

How about the ones
that unlocked the ropes?

Ah. Yeah.

Stop it.

What? Come on.

There's no way
this is gonna fit.

Nice.

It was your fucking idea.

Look, there's gotta be
a key here somewhere,

let's just find it.

Oh, my God.

Would you just...
[Tyler] God.

Hey, hey, look for a clock
that only has a minute hand.

Why?
Just fucking do it,
Anderson.

Okay.
Here, got it.

This clock only has
a minute hand.

Okay.
What the hell is up
with these clocks?

Here, here, here.

All right,
what the fuck?

[clock clatters]

If I...


Hm.

That's impressive.
Very impressive.



Here, help me.


Ah?
Yes!

Yeah! Hey, guys.

You're my hero.
Thank you.
Hey.

You guys rescued us.

Yeah, any longer
and someone's pants'd
be on the floor.

She's wearing a skirt.
That is correct.

Oh, gross.
[laughs]

[TVs powering up]

What the fuck?

Â¶

Uh...


Oh, my God!

Where is she?

Yeah, things
just got weird.

Wow.

What?

It's all part of the game.

Â¶

fucking cool.

Look, look.
We have 41 minutes
to rescue Christen.

That's the game.

Christen said
we had an hour.

Well, the timer
must have started
when we got here.

It was probably me.
I flipped the switch
over there.

Oh.

Why isn't she
in here with us?

Why would she lock herself
in a cage somewhere?

I don't know, Anderson.
That's what we have
to figure out.

Fine.
Whatever.

At least we know
what we're playing for
now, right?

Bingo. That's
the can-do attitude

we like to hear
from you, Anderson.

Now, time is of the essence.

So, it's a good thing
I know exactly
what we have to do next.

Check it out.

What happened?

What do you mean?

Weren't there squares
with letters on them
right here?

Oh, yeah,
there were.

Yeah, but they were
there the whole time.

Are you sure
about that?

'Cause you guys
were just sucking
a whole bunch of face.

Yeah, well, when was
the last time you two
sucked face? Huh?

Look, as soon
as we got out
of the room,

it must have
disappeared.

It's probably
the door. Huh?

[hisses]
[beeps]

Hey.

Wait!
Shut it again.

you have to spell
something.

Yeah, but what?
[Tyler exhales]

There's got to be
something.

Oh, that--
What the fuck is that?


Nice.

Was that thing
strapped to your junk?

It sure was.

She released the Kraken.
Oh!

[laughter]
Well, I'm not getting it.

Getting what?
It's another card.

Oh.
Mm-hmm.

Fuck it.

Ugh.

Guys, come on.
It was on the outside
of my pants.

He's clean.
I would know.

Excellent.

Well, I don't see
any other clues here,

so let's keep focused.
[claps and snaps fingers]

Go. Go, go, go.
Yeah.

Â¶

Well, it obviously
wants us to spell
something,

so...
How big a word?

Nine letters?
Nine letters?
Fuck, big word.

It's like an answer
to a crossword puzzle.

Oh, you love
crossword puzzles.

He does.
[Tabby chuckles]

And the answer is
in one of these newspapers.

Yes.

We don't have time
to go through all of these.

some of us look
for crosswords

while the others
look for clues.

You know,
get a system going.

That's gonna
take forever.

<i> There has to be</i>
<i> some kind of order.</i>

<i> Oh, what if there's</i>
<i> a clue in a headline?</i>

Well, theme in this one
is dead celebrities,
if that helps.

Well, did any of them
die on today's date?

Maybe that's
a fucking clue.

The dates.

That's actually
not a bad idea.

Nice, Christen.

My birthday.

Look for today's date
30 years ago.
Yes.

Â¶

is all 1990s.

'70s.

Oh! I got the '80s.
[Conrad laughs]

[Tyler] Perfect.
Yes!

Okay...

All right, who's got
October 13th?

Ah, got it.

Yes, right here.

That's it.

All right,
it wants one word.

[Conrad] All right,
how many letters?
Nine.

Nice.
All right, the clue is...

"narcissistic notes."

Interesting.

I'm glad we got
an easy one.

All right, well,
uh, shut me in the room

and I'll put in words
until I figure it out.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

We started in there.
Let us take this one.

Tyler.

Conrad, this
is gonna involve

some quick
problem-solving
on the fly

and I'm not really sure
that's your forte.

Whoa, whoa.

What?

You can let someone else
do something, Tyler.

All right.

All right.

Oh! I got it.

"Egomaniac."

Actually,
that could work.

Yes.


[Tyler sighs]

Well...

[tones playing]

[exhales sharply]
Damn it.

Narcissistic notes.

Something about
letters... memos.

Ego's memos.

That has an apostrophe.

So?
So it's definitely
not the answer.

Oh. What if note isn't to do
with something written?

What'd you mean?

Like a musical note?

Like what is
a narcissistic's song?

[Conrad laughs]
Oh, looks like Anderson
needs a hug.

egotistic?



What is Carly Simon's
"You're So Vain"?

That definitely won't fit.

Also, this isn't
<i> Jeopardy,</i> so...

Well, you come up
with something,
smart guy.

Whatever it is,
it's your theme song.

What did you say?
Huh?

Nothing, just that
my wife is stuck up
and she doesn't know--

No, not that.
I love you.

Try this.

T.

T? Okay, T.
Yes.

[no audible dialogue]

Theme song.

Theme song.
A-B-C-D-E-F--

[beeps]
Yes!

[gasps]
Yes!

Yes! [laughs]

<i> Ha!</i>


Nice. I'll go
let 'em out.

If they<i> want</i> to get out.
I'll never
get used to that.

Oh, who's the protective
big brother?

Stop.

I love how when you pretend
to have a conscience...

I said fucking stop!
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

Â¶

[key snaps]

Hey! Fuck!

What's wrong?

The key broke off
in the fucking door.

What do you mean it broke?

I tried to open it
and it wouldn't open.

Damn it.
You disappoint me.

Really, Anderson?
[sighs] Jesus.

I don't see--

That's a little much.

<i> - [Conrad singing]</i>
<i> - Whoa! So fancy.</i>

<i> [laughing]</i>


You're gonna have to sit tight

'til we can figure
how to get you out.


Wait.

What's that?

[gas hissing]

It's all part
of the game, right?

Yeah. That's weird.

What?

We solved the puzzle.
Why would the door
close again?

Well, maybe--

maybe there's something else
that we have to do?

That doesn't make sense.

Wait.

[loud hissing]

Â¶

Something's wrong.


What is that?


It looks like it's burning them.

Like... acid.


Oh, my God!

[gasps]
Oh!

Tabby! Tabby!


Holy shit!
What the fuck
is happening to them?

Tabby! No!
Oh, shit...

[slow motion breathing]


Tabby!
[ticking]


Ah!
Fuck!

Damn it!

What is happening?
Tabby!


Something's happening to them!

No!
[Anderson] Oh, my God!

Tabby!
Oh, my God!

[Natasha screaming]
Tabby!

Get down!
Get on the floor!

[gagging]
[Natasha] Oh, my God!

Tabby!
[Anderson] Oh, shit!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Fuck! Fuck!

Oh, my God...

Holy shit.
Tabby!

Conrad!
What the fuck
is going on?

[Anderson] Oh, my God!
Tabby!

What is this?

Tabby? Tabby!

Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

[Natasha] Fuck!
[Tyler] Fuck!


Fuck.

Â¶

What the fuck
is this place?

[labored breathing]


Â¶

[Anderson gasping]

No.

What did you do?

I didn't--

I didn't do anything.

It locked on its own!

I-I-I tried to open it.

No, you fucked it up
and look what happened.

You couldn't do anything!
I tried to help them!

Look at you!

I tried to help them.



No.

Don't hurt her.


No.

It's real.

It's all real.
Real?

What are you talking about?
Of c-- of course...

Why would Christen
bring us here?

Christen's
in trouble, too.

Then why the fuck
isn't she in the room
with us?

She's locked
in a fucking cage,
Anderson!

Christ.

It's not a game.

We have to get out of here.

Help me!

Fuck!


Fuck! Fuck!
There's no way!

What? So--
so we're trapped?

There's no puzzle
to get us out of here?

Fuck these puzzles!


[Natasha cries]
[exhales]

All these rooms
are enclosed.

Yeah. We figured that out
a long time ago.

What are you getting at?
Which means there must be
some sort of ventilation.

Here!

Fuck.
I'm here.

Take this.

[grille clatters]

We have to go.

No way.
No fucking way!

Do you want
to get out of here?

Did you see
what just happened
to Conrad and Tabby?

There's got to be
another way
to open up the door.

Do you really want
to wait around
and figure it out?

What if there is
no way to open the door?

What if it's
just a matter of time

until this entire place
fills up with more acid fog

and we fucking fry,
Anderson?

I'm going.

What?
I'm going.

We're going.

[breathing heavily]

[duct thudding]

Tash.
I got... I gotta go.

[shaky breath]

Okay. Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

The vent turns.

Just keep moving.
[groans]

I'm right behind you.

[Natasha] Anderson!
Fuck!

Â¶


There's something up ahead.

Like it could be an opening.


[labored breathing]


Â¶

[grunts]
[Natasha] What?

It's another
fucking puzzle.


Fuck is with this shit?!

Let's just go back!

No! There's a puzzle,
we'll solve it,
we'll get out of here.

Get out of my way!
Shit!

Jesus!
[grunts]

Fuck!

Shit!

It's fine, we're getting out.
We just gotta--

we gotta...

I don't understand this.
[groans]

Okay. Maybe it's--

No, no, no, wait,
wait, wait!
[beeps]

Shit.
Why the fuck--

God damn it, Natasha!
I didn't know!

Fuck!
Move!

Help-- Let me see it!
Let me see it!
Fuck!

Shut up! Fuck.
[Natasha] Fuck.

[Anderson] Move!
No!

Fuck!
Just let me see it.
I can do this.

No, shut up!
Tyler!

Fuck!
Move, he's good
at these things.

Fuck.

It's the Greek riddle
of the Sphinx.

Well, then answer it.
Hang on!

[metallic scraping]

Did you hear that?
What?

What?
Just, shh!

Just listen.
You hear it?

[metallic scraping]

Yeah, I hear it.

Oh, my God,
it's getting louder.

Anderson!
It's getting louder!

Anderson!
Okay, okay, okay.

Um, find a sun.
Okay.

Put it next to the sunrise.

Good, good. Next.

Now find a star
and put it next to that.

Yes!
All right.

Next one, next one. Come on!

An infant.
What?

A baby!
A fucking baby!
Okay, where?

Put it next to that.

Okay. Next.
Next one, come on!

All right.
Hurry! Just hurry!

An old man!
Here, here, here!

[gasps]
[metallic scraping]

Fuck.

Fuck!
What?

What the? Something
just shut the duct
behind me.

Are you okay?
No! What the fuck is it?

Oh, my God!
[shouting]

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Come on!

My leg is stuck.
Go!

My leg is stuck!
My leg is stuck!

Help me! Help me!
Oh, my God! Help!

[squelches]
Oh, my God!

No.

Â¶

Anderson!

Anderson, come on!

He's not coming.

<i> We're gonna die in here.</i>

We're gonna die
in here.

We're gonna die.

[breathing deeply]

He knew.

What?

Anderson knew.
He had to know.


I wanted him
to know.

I wanted him
to get mad at me.

[exhales]
I wanted to<i> feel </i>
something.

Jesus fucking Christ.

He never said anything.


Hey!

Pull your shit together!

Oh, my God.

Oh... oh, oh!

Oh, my God!

Why are all these wires
coming out of the TVs?

Tyler.

These. They're
primary colors.

It's gotta be another
fucking puzzle, right?

I mean, look at them.

Yes.

Yellow and red make orange.

And blue and yellow
make green.

[crackling]
And green and orange
are left.

It has to be. Yes.

[music plays]



[music plays]

<i> [grunts] What the fuck?</i>


Fuck.

What do we do?
I don't know.

What the fuck do we do?
I don't know!

It's all part of the game,
Tyler.

You always know the answer.

What the fuck do we do?
I said I don't know!

Exactly.
You<i> don't</i> know.

You think you're
so fucking perfect,
Tyler.

Shut up.

You think Christen didn't see
through your bullshit,

that everyone didn't know
what you were doing.

Shut the fuck up!

She knew.


"Teddy Bear Picnic."
What?

Only Christen would know
that I<i> fucking</i> hate that song.


Oh, fuck.

Fuck!

Â¶

We only have three minutes.
Shut up!

I feel something.
There's a handle.

[music stops]

Thank God.

[lock clicks]
[music plays]

Oh.
Fuck, fuck!

It locked again.
Shit!

Â¶

[lock clicks]

Yes!


Oh, shit!


Fuck!
[groans]

Fuck! Fuck!

What?
The door's too heavy,
I can't open it.

Come do this.

[music plays]
I'll open
the goddamned door.

Okay.

I think I feel something.

Do it!
[music stops]


[lock clicks]
[gasps]

What happened?
[whirring]


started closing on my arm.

You hold it,
I'll hold the door open,

and when I say "go,"
you run.

Â¶

There's no time to waste,
Natasha!

Okay, okay!
Jesus.

[nervous breathing]

Now!

It's closing! It's closing!

It's closing, Tyler!
It's closing!

Just a little bit more!
It's closing on my arm!

It's closing
on my arm, Tyler!

Oh, it's closing!

[screaming]
Just a little more.


Oh, my God! Hurry!

It's cutting my arm, Tyler!

Stop, Tyler!
It's gonna break my arm.

Stop opening it!

It's closing, it's closing!

I'm sorry.

I'm fine.

What is this, Christen?

<i> What?</i>

What is this?

<i> What are you talking about?</i>

Why did you bring us here?

<i> What do you mean?</i>

Why did you bring us here?

<i> I didn't do anything.</i>

<i> I didn't know. I wasn't--</i>

Have you been watching
this whole time?

<i> Tyler..</i>

Saw them all die?

Is that your fucking idea?
[cries]

Did you plan that?

They're all dead
because of you.

<i> I-- How could you say that?</i>

<i> Don't, Tyler. It's--</i>

<i> How could you say that?</i>

My sister is dead.
My sister is dead!

<i> Because of you.</i>
<i> Is this some sort of sick joke?</i>

No.
<i> - Tell me.</i>

<i> - Tyler. </i>
Oh, oh.

So I assume you had-- you had
nothing to do with this?

<i> No! I woke up in this cage.</i>

I don't fucking believe you,
Christen.

I just want this to be over.

You think I can't tell
when you're lying to me?

I didn't do anything.
I'm so-- I'm so--

Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I-I can't hear you, Christen.

You know, because I can't hear
anything over fucking lies!

Tyler, what's happening?
You're lying!

Believe me!
There's no time, Christen.

Tyler!
No! Say it!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
