Dominoes, the greatest game
ever invented mother fuckers.

Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen,

Wannabe domino players,
fans, groupies,

and niggas sick
and tired of losing

all the motherfucking time.

Welcome to my Masterclass.

I am the Pimpfesser
Dr. DMF, AKA Big Dub.

Look, I'm here to
explain this shit,

so sit down and
shut the fuck up.

See dominoes was
started by the Chinese.

Down in the Compton
part of China.

[laughs loudly]

[gun shots ring]

Back in the war.
[Man] What war?

Would you shut the fuck up?

I told you I'm on TV.

It don't matter what war.

Nigga we got so many, who cares?

Yeah, shut the fuck up.

Like I was saying before
I was rudely interrupted.

[cart speeds off]

My great-great-great-
great-grandfather

learned the game
from the Chinese.

He snatched the big six.

We wrote the whole damn game.

Then he smuggled
it back to America.

Where it spread like
mudbutt on ribs.

You dig?

Mother fuckers from all parts
of the world took to it.

'Cause see, that's
the magic of dominoes.

It brings people together.

Even the saltiest motherfucker
will pull that stick

out of their ass when they
sit down and throw them bones.

28 bones to be exact.

Yeah, yeah I know, real bones
are white and so are dominoes,

but they wouldn't mean shit

if it wasn't for them
black dots, you feel me?


Can I get a witness?


Ah fuck you.

Big six is the highest number.

Match the numbers in
your hand to seven

with the bones on the table.

If you can't play,

that's when you draw from
the boneyard until you can.

Score in multiples of five,

and play until you
have your last domino.

And when that's gone,
you yell "Domino!"

Or as we say in the hood,
"Domino motherfucker!"

To let them know you run shit.

And that's all there is to it.

Buy my app, if you're too slow

to figure the rest
of this shit out.

Now, for real, shut the fuck up

while I watch the wildest,
ratchetest domino tournament

ever played.

[laughs loudly]

I know y'all ain't ready.

Oh, sorry.

Oh, thank you.

Yeah, it's pretty
fly stuff right?

Yeah, we're getting
dozens of responses.

What do you mean our
credits in the toilet?

In fact, it depends on
how your defining toilet.

money for the kids.

No.


You can't take the
boys away from me.

they're coming with me.

Oh my God, just.

I really got a good feeling
about this, this is the big one.

it's the last straw.

Just stick with
me, honey, honey!

[Camera man] Everything okay?

Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, if you
could, just give me a sec.

[Camera man] Yeah.

[Walter sobs loudly]

[chill hip hop music]

This is my kitchen.

Where I cook things I like.

I don't know what
white folks like.

That's the living room.

That's where I play dominoes.

Hey, hey, don't touch that!

Still got a game going.

I'm sorry, I didn't know.

Who's she?

That's Ella May.

Sweetest most faithful
woman to ever live.

[harp fading in]

Ella, I wanna
give you something.

I wanna give you this ring.

Gerald, Where'd you
get this ring from?

I know you didn't buy me no
ring with no gambling money.

I don't want no gambling ring.

I told you I ain't
gambling no more.

I got this ring with
my hard earned money,

and I want you to have it.

I ain't lying.

Then I'll wear it,
and cherish it forever!

Shit, you better cherish
that damn ring forever.

You with me for the long haul.

Till death, do us part.

Okay.

[mosquito buzzing]

Goddam mosquito.

Where the waiter at? Goddamn.

Been waiting for our
damn food for 30 minutes.

All they brought us
is some damn wine.

I'm hungry!

[harp fading out]

That's your room on the left.

Wait a minute.

Slow your roll son.

Everything in here
is important to me.

I don't want you to forget that.

Neat, I definitely
will, Granddad.

And I'm not your granddad!

Do we look related?

My good for nothing,
all the time, son

ditched you on me.

And that's what this
is, social service.

So since we gotta be
trapped in here together,

I got some rules and shit.

Don't touch nothing
that ain't yours.

Wash your ass, keep
my house clean,

and make yourself useful.

White privilege is a foreign
term in Compton, boy.

If you didn't
know, now you know.

And that's my room on the right.

Whoa, that's a lot of pills.

Hey, don't touch those.

They're for my heart.

I forget them sometimes.

So you see them lying
around, leave them be.

And you must be Ms. Jeffries.

Mr. McDonough.

Yes, Walter McDonough,
so nice to meet you.

Pleasure to meet you.

Please, let me show
you around the venue.

Now, Pastor recently
bought this place.

So it's still a
work in progress.

Oh, don't mind the mess.

As long as you don't
mind my camera crew here!

You're so gorgeous!

You should be in the movies!

Oh, I wish I was.

I mean, this crib could
use some renovations.

I mean, wasn't
Jesus a carpenter?

Yes, and a divine one.

Oh, all right.

Well, hopefully
he'll come back soon.

We could really use him, huh?

You know, I'm just,
I'm like a chameleon.

I'm always rebuilding
myself, rebranding.

After 34 years of
award-winning service,

they just revoked my
retirement fund, huh?

I guess you don't send a
little old mimis around

with the lady showing her-

But, uh, you know,

so I had to dabble in a
lot of different things.

And some of them were just
right before their time.

[chuckles softly]

You know, they say
you miss a 100%

of the shots you don't take.

So I'm glad I took those swings.

It's just unfortunate that
they ricocheted right back

and hit me in the nuts.

Oh, this way to
the pastor's office.

He should be in there now.

Give you a hand there.

Thank you, Mr. McDonough.

There you go.

Follow me.

[pastor praying quietly]

Goddamn, Ms. Jeffries.

Even the Devil knocked twice.

I was just spreading some...

[Ms. Jeffries] God comes
in a thief in the night.


Okay, we brought a
guest, a visitor.

Pastor Steele, this
is Mr. Walter McDonough.

He's the gentleman who's
going to rent the venue

tomorrow afternoon.

His crew is loading
in right now.

Okay, you got my check, right?

Yeah, yeah, I sure do.

It's right here.

Yeah, there you go.

All right, all right.

Thank you, Jesus.

All right, Ms. Jeffries,

You go and run that
money down to the bank.

You know, take care of,

and I'll put you on

Be marching with you, okay?

Shit, for an old lady,

Ms. Jeffries got ass.

But anyway, you know, this
was a Mexican restaurant.

And they was selling
some nasty tacos.

That's why it shut
down, but you know,

and then I decided to
get ordained by the Lord

and we went into
business together.

So we got a lot to do, man.

A lot to catch up on.

So I'm going to
take y'all around

in the spirit of the Lord.

[chill hip hop music
playing softly]

Granp...

Mr. Edges, your food is ready.

Hot damn Rufus,
it's been your play

for the last five
fucking minutes.

Mr....

Not now, boy!

Can't you see I'm busy?

[Andy sighs]

What, boy? You're
breaking my concentration.

Well, your food's ready.

My mom says the body needs
three square meals a day

to be happy and healthy.

You sure she stopped at three?

What I need is to play somebody

who ain't just sold their fridge

to get that China Brown.
[Rufus snoring]

What I need is somebody
I can talk shit to.

You can talk shit to me.

Watch your fucking
mouth in my house.

What you know about them bones?

It's basic
probability, really.

It all comes down to
how many variations

of numbers you can play

based on the factors of
the hand you've drawn.

And then you calculate the
most efficient statistical one,

until you're down
to a single tile.

You mean you know
how to play this shit?

Well, I, uh, yeah.

Hell, Andy!

Shit!

Hell!

Damn!

Shit!

Why didn't you say so?

Rufus.

Rufus!

Take your ass home!

No, no way down
to the damn floor.

Go on home, you
ain't no good here!

I'm gonna call your mama
and tell you on your way.

You know I ain't got no car.

You calling me an Uber?

Uber?

The fuck is a Uber?

I got some Goobers.

You want some peanuts?

Bye, Rufus.

Let's see what you got.

Watch them.

[mellow hip hop music]

That's all you got?

[dominoes clacking on table]

That a bitch!

Your mama do voodoo or
something like that?

Damn!

Is white privilege in Compton?

Domino?

[vinyl record squeaking
to a sudden stop]

The fuck just happen?

What kind of Twilight Zone
have I just slipped into?

Is this what a
stroke feels like?

Sorry, well, my mom
says I don't make friends

because they're intimidated
by my intellect.

And that I should be
proud of my gifts.

I try to listen to her.

But it's hard to see your inner
light, or much light at all,

when you're stuffed
inside your locker.

Yeah.

Well how the fuck did your
little albino sausage fingers

learn to throw bones like that?

Oh, from this app.

App?

The fuck is a app?

It's a way you can
play people on the phone.

It was actually
beating the AI system

that got me so proficient
at it and the...

Fuck, wait a goddamn minute!

You're telling me you ain't
playing against people

just your damn phone?

Well, there are other
opponents on their phones, too.

The fuck is the
world coming to!

Dear God, Jesus, you oughta
just come back and kill us all.

Oh, bring the rapture, Lord.

Look.

You can't play bones
with a screen, boy.

Dominoes, real dominoes is
all about the mental game

just as much as
it is the numbers.

You hear me?

We got a lot of training to do...

We?

I'm sorry, I just, I
can't cheat for you.

My mom would...

It ain't cheating actually.

Niggas do bones with a spotter.

You do wanna be a
real nigga, don't you?

Ah, don't you answer that shit.

I see that shit eating
grin on your face.

Look, I need a spotter.

You wanna be a real nigga.

Everybody wins.

So come on.

Let's practice.

What's you got in your hand?

Double six.

No, no, elephant ass, no.

It's called Big Six!

Look, I don't want you
getting laughed off the table

with your Oxford English
motherfucking speaking ass.

All right?

Lord, help me, he
got a ways to go.

You know, you sure talk a lot

but I'm beating you 75 to 25.

Are you?

You think you're winning, huh?

What I see across from me

is a neglected little boy.

You know my son is

[chair squeaking]

pumping your momma right now.

Putting an integrated
baby in her with my DNA.

That's going to be
stronger, faster,

and a million times more
mocha latte lovelier than you.

And when that baby comes,

it ain't gonna take no time

forgetting your pasty, two
tons of fun ass ever existed.

[slams domino onto table]

Domino.

See.

You don't win at bones unless
you get in the folks head.

The game is all mental.

I'm tired of this game.

Why don't you me about
that scary devil guy

you were talking about?

Never mentioned that
guy's name in my house.

And if there is a God,

he'll give me my revenge

at this tournament
I'm training for.

I want the whole
world to see me whoop

that tweaking bully's ass!

[funky music]

See, usually ladies,

I don't mingle amongst
them gangster thug

sober motherfuckers.

Who in the fuck gonna
gang bang if you're sober?

That's silly, I
don't trust them.

See, if I want to win this
tournament and get my crown,

I had to call in the
baddest gangster bitches

security guards I know.

And it was you and you.

You gotta understand
this is about me.

I am the greatest
motherfucker that ever lived.

There's God.

And then,

there is me!

[laughing loudly]

[snorting cocaine loudly]

[high pitched excited yelling]

[funky music]

You know the Lord
laid his hand down

in this one right here.

You know, this is the room.

You know, this is the one
for all my entrepreneurs.

You know, the big wigs.

Yeah man, what a blessing.
So, but this is the lobby?

Oh yeah, yeah, what a
blessing, what a blessing.

Well it just seemed like the
pictures made it look bigger

in the pamphlet.

Yeah, we do that.

Namita, hold off one second.

Is this ceiling load-bearing?

Uh, partially.

Hey, God bless you.

Well, let's just
hold off for a second.

Till I get this figured out.

I got a lot of run
running on this

and I can't have any lawsuits

'cause I've technically
maxed out my credit cards

and put a lien on my house.

But it's all good.

It's all good.

Whoa!

Oh, I gotta sit down.

Woo, who knew?

But yeah, it's good.

You know, I haven't
seen my kids in a while.

Ever since my wife threw me out.

She said, and I quote,

"I'm an abject failure and
a complete joke of man."

But I think this tournament's

gonna turn everything
around, right?


Yeah!

We can do this, right?

Namita, give me, give it up.

All right, yeah.

My name is Namita Sodhi.

I am the event coordinator
and general task master

for the WDC.

I'd like to say, for the record,

that I'm here to serve my
client's personal needs

and tastes.

And that if I were
running things,

my decisions would have been,

different.

But considering the I'm
the only, even marginally,

competent person here,

I think things could have
turned out a lot worse.

And by that, I mean we've
yet to have anyone seriously,

injured.

[ladder clacking]


This is fucking heavy.

Oh shit, shit, shit!

[glass and metal crashing]

And this is my
prize back here.

'Cause the Lord said,
"Let there be light!"

[electricity zapping]

There it is.

Oh, yeah.

Does that happen a lot?

Oh, when you got
Jesus on the main line,

anything is possible.

Okay.

And I call this my incubator.

These are the companies
and the brands that I own.

It's not for you.

I got some big stuff for you.

I got the big room for you.

This is just
collaborations of brands

I wanted to introduce
you to, you know,

like I can partner with you.

Well, it's nice.

It's not exactly
what I envisioned

but what's that saying?

"A shoddy craftsman
blames his tools."

[Pastor laughing]

I don't know what the
fuck you talking about

but do you wanna
partner with Mac Woo?

Macaroni and sushi?

Bomb.

Oh, sure we're always
looking for sponsors.

Yeah, I'm just really
excited to get going here.

It's gonna be a great show.

Me too.

And so when Ms.
Jeffries' cash that check

and it go "cha-ching",
then we can go.

Until then, you don't want
me and the Lord on your ass.

No, no I don't.

Don't don't make
me pray for you, boy.

Okay.

[sighing exasperatedly]

[electricity buzzing]

Oh, come on! Namita!

Can you please do
something about this light?

Hey, Walter, it's cool.

I got this.

[sighs loudly]

I'm sorry.

We just got such a
big show planned.

People are gonna be asking
you what are you doing here?

They'll be all up in your grill.

But fact of the matter is,
once we have our winner,

we'll be able to edit this
together in a nice tight promo.

And sell it to a
couple of investors

I got coming out
on tournament day.

So, everything goes as planned,

we're gonna be in business.

think you can get this off

without a hitch?

Well, you know what?

I've pretty much
lost everything.

So what's the worst
that could happen, huh?

His dumbass got no idea.

Follow me, ladies.

I'm trying to tell y'all

and then when we do
what we gotta do.

What the fuck?

Do you know who
the fuck that is?

No, cuz.

Well kick the
motherfucker in the ass!

Get him!

[women yelling]

[man grunting and yelling]

[laughing loudly]

This is my brother!

Ain't these some bad
motherfuckers, aint they?

You better tell them who I am!

Okay, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

We don't need to
kill my brother.

Boy, y'all are some bad
motherfuckers though.

Now y'all get back over there.

Take my keys, what we doing

[whispers softly]

This ain't WWF motherfucker!

I'm gonna take your ass-

[yelling and arguing]

Hold on, killas!

Calm down.

There's plenty of ass to kick.

It's cool, shit, hold up.

This is important to me.

Excuse me, she's calling me.

[snorting loudly]

Ain't nothing more beautiful

than breaking a
motherfucking domino.

When you break a
motherfucker in dominoes

it's like breaking their
motherfucking soul!

Let me show you
motherfuckers something.

See this shit here?

[locks clicking]

[mimicking angels singing]

Y'all do this shit?

No.

No, thanks.

You wanna start?

[trippy music]

It's like 37
orgasms at one time.

Now, what we're gonna do,

is this right here.

Follow me.

[roller skates screeching]

[funky psychedelic music]

Look at it!

Look around.

Don't touch nothing!

This right here, ladies,

my greatest prized possession!


[upbeat funky music]

Domino D.

This motherfucker was
undefeated, never lost a game!

I tore his ass up just when
he thought he had it made!

[short quick yelps]

And the nigga passed out.

I went to his funeral.

Best funeral I ever been to.

Boy, I enjoyed it.

[sighs loudly]

Gerald Edges.

I've been beating this
motherfucker his whole life.

Even with his wife dying.

I just don't give a fuck.

I got his ring.

I love beating
this motherfucker.

And when I beat this dude again,

my book will be complete!

Domino OG, I hate to do
it to you but I had to.

Ah, man.

Man, Calvin, I'll
catch you little later.

I'ma get you.


I'ma get you.


What's up, buzzard?

What's happening, man?

Let's [indistinct] blood,
what's happening, man?

What you been doing?

Uh, nothing, nothing.

I ain't seen you in
a good minute, bruh.

I had probably thought
you were up and relocated

or something.

Ah, shit, nah man. It just
happened like that, man.

You know what I'm saying?

I've been in the
wind, you feel me?

I had to get relocated a little
bit, you what I'm saying?

I'm out to play my priorities,
blood, you feel me?

Prison, nigga.

Okay, right, right.

I understand every word
you just said, man.

Shit, I see you're
still representing

for the Swetto, blood.

That's what's up.

Oh, for sure. For sure.

I rep every day.

I wake up in the morning saying
Sewoo-nothing but the blood!

I even do them when I go to bed.

Sewoo, I pray. [snoring loudly]

All right, what's up.

I'd be happy to be free,
you know what I'm saying.

'Cause like with
the Lord on my side,

I can go down a righteous
path, you feel me?

And put all that shit behind me.

I'm tryna win this domino
tournament, you feel me?

and get all the bread from that.

And get my own spot.

So right now, I'm
at the point where

every time I think about beating
the shit out of somebody,

I just rub my thumbs
against my earlobes

and shit like this, right?

And I just be like
"On bloods, nigga.

Don't break this
nigga's chin on bloods."

That shit be working
every time though.

Not every time.

Sometimes I still fuck a nigga
up but other than that nigga,

I'm basically out here
living a zen life-

Oh shit.

Who the fuck threw
the ball at me?

I don't know, OG.

Throw me a shot.

[yelling excitedly]

[fist smacking face]

Oh, hell no, shit!

[low tempo hip hop music]

[speaks Spanish]

Oh, why don't you
stay out of my business

and off of the tables, kiddo.

Because Dominica has
been embarrassing

the whole family lately.

Who's Dominica?

My alter ego.

Get out of my room.

[yells in Spanish]
[speaks Spanish]

I'm a grown ass woman!

Sure doesn't look like it.

We just wanna know where
you're going [speaks Spanish]

To practice for the
domino tournament tomorrow.

What?

Is that allowed?

What do you think, Mom?

[speaks Spanish]

So why don't you follow your
mother's example for once?

Respect the men of
the house, you know?

How about you find your balls

or get my dad's out
of your fucking mouth!

[speaks Spanish]

Do I look okay, papa, huh?

I don't know how
to answer that.

Why do you have to be this way?

It's unnatural!

You know, after a long
day's work, men come home.

They like to unwind
over a game of bones.

We should have
that right as men!

Women, they have
their own sports even.

Like volleyball.

Ribbon dancing.

Basket weaving.

Basket weaving, ha!

For real?

You guys can talk all the
misogynist shit you want

but when I come back
holding this trophy,

my seat at the table
will be undeniable!

I'll be the best domino
player to carry the Ines name.

[upbeat music]

[pounding on wall]

Andy!

Come on, boy, wake up!

It's time to go.

We got a tournament to win.

â™ª Watch me run it up â™ª

â™ª All up in your face â™ª

â™ª Watch me run it up â™ª

â™ª I can't get enough â™ª

â™ª She gon' give me top yeah â™ª

â™ª Let's go hit the cook now â™ª

â™ª Stick stuff in they cup aye â™ª

All right, boy, we got to
get there early and register.

Then go over a few things.

We're not taking the car?

Why would we take a car when
it's just a couple of blocks?

Gas is as high as a
giraffe's coochie.

Granddad.
You better hurry up.

Wait up.

Unless you got
navigation on that phone.

And I ain't your damn granddad.

[Andy panting out of breath]

Hurry up boy!

I'm on a mission.

I'm gonna take this bitch down.

And this is gonna be it.

Me and Tenspeed.

I'm coming for you!

Worst day of my fucking
life, you feel me?

Worst.

You know you're still white

even though you
wear Nike's, right?

Man, pay attention
what I'm saying!

My bad, nigga, my bad.

What I'm saying is, before
I even could do anything

she walked in on me
with her sister, man.

Fucked up.

Ah, man, what'd you say?

Man, I said I was trying
to get to know her family

a little better, you
know what I'm saying?

Get a little relations
with the relatives,

you know what I'm saying?

Shit, nigga, did it work?

No, it didn't work!

I can't take my advice from
Shaggy songs, my nigga.

That only works for
light skinned niggas

with their shirts off.

Hey, did you just
see this Rastafari

with this check right here?

You know how many
Nike's and tattoos

that he can buy
with that, nigga?

That's 10 thou-wow!

Oh we about to get it, nigga.

[Gerald panting]

What kind of ghetto
ass operation is this,

not having a ramp
for my wheelchair?

Y'all trying to kill the king

before I get a chance
to sit in my throne?

So who do I need to
make wild passionate

chittlin grease love to to
get some water up in here?

[Andy coughing loudly]


body completely shut down

and reboot itself stronger.

That's the way real
black slaves did it.

And you're welcome for
the history lesson.

You poor thing.

Are you okay?

Thank you.

I love you.

Okay.

I mean, I'm Andy.

Have some water.

Hi, I'm Andy.

Get out of my
fucking way, kid!

Look, you can't be going around
with my name in your mouth

acting softer than baby shit.

You got to take
pride in yourself.

You wanna be a Edges?

You don't take nothing
off of nobody, ever.

[funky, psychedelic music]

Shit.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Tenspeed is in the building.

[laughs loudly]

Drop it [screams]


You wanna get this [indistinct]

Ha, if it ain't the S.N.I.C!

You know what that means,
little white fella?

No.


Well, let me tell you.

If it ain't the saddest
nigga in Compton,

Gerald motherfucking Edges.

Tenspeed.

I see that rehab
went terribly bad.

The judge must've
been on drugs.

He shouldn't have been trying
to stop me from doing cocaine.

I love cocaine, nigga.

That's not what this is about.

This is about if you think
you finna come to Compton

and take my victory from me.

See, let me explain something
to you about winning.

Only a loser would lose
something so precious.

You're a loser, Gerald.

You can't fool a nigga like me.

You lost the most precious
thing that God gave to man.

That you vowed that
you could keep it

and you lost it!

When you get your ass
played at dominoes,

you think about this.

It's 2020.

You run around
here like it's 1974

with all that goddam chest
hair on your goddam chest.

You look ridiculous!

You need to get a tattoo
that says "Flammable".


I love this shit.

[roller blades screeching]

Come on, Andy.

Don't worry, Grandad.

No matter what it takes,

if it means bending
the rules a little,

I'm gonna help you
bury his second rate

Scooby Doo villain looking ass.

Because Edges stand up
for themselves, right?

You damn skippy, my
little soda cracker.

[roller blades skidding]

Look at all this sweet shit!

Hell, look at all
these goddam brownies.

Trying to fuck up
my blood pressure.

All this sweet shit.

Let me add a little,

a little flavor to this.

Tenspeed flavor.

Don't want to put too much...

Just balance my blood sugar.


[deep bass hip hop music]

Name please.

Slams. S-L-A-M-S.

Oh, sorry, your
birth name, sir?

Oh, that's
Rutherford Wrinkleton.


Really?

Yeah, it's on my parole
bar, you know what I mean?

I just got out.

You know, I did like a quick 10.

I don't even know what's
bracking these days.

What you like to do?

You like going to the binema?

Sorry, what?

The movies, you like
going to the movies?

Oh, mm-hmm.

Okay, bull, bull.

So maybe after this, we can
go catch like a [indistinct]

matinee or something?

I'm more of a Netflix
& chill girl, honestly.

All right, Netflix is bull.

I could do that, what's that?

That's the new shit?

Okay, I'm with that.

My name right there though.

[chuckles softly]

Excuse me, miss!

I'm gonna need you
to hold on a second.

I'm gonna need you to step
over here for a second,

big fella.

Random search!

I really don't think
that's necessary.

I rolled a dice and
his number came up!

I want you to know I'm extremely
proficient with a taser.

And I have a certificate.

I'm gonna need you to
assume the position

I'm sure you're familiar.

Please spread them!

Oh my god this is ridiculous!

What's going on here!

Is this a weapon?

Is this a weapon?

Are you moving suddenly?

Do not move suddenly, sir!


I got this under
control ma'am!

It's a spork, blood.

I don't do forks no more, man.

They too sharp.

And spoons are too dull.

That's a hybrid utensil, blood.

A spork.

All right, I'm gonna need to
take this one to the back.

Why?

Why?

[Security Guard]
Ma'am, let me do my job!

I have an online degree!

No!

All right, full cavity search.

The fuck you say?

Stand down!

Don't you know who this is?

This is legendary
Bonesmith Big Slams.

From the D Block.

Come on, G.

I am so sorry, Mr. Slams.

It's bull.

It is not bull,
it is not bull.

We're gonna treat you like
the pampered prince you are.

We're gonna make sure
you get all the L'Croix

and hand sanitizer your
massive heart can handle.

All right?

And some cocoa butter so
your elbows don't get ashy.

I know, 'cause I
get ashy elbows.

Little known fact,
white guys get ashy too!

Yeah, it's true, it's true.

All right, come on Namita,
let's get him his name tag.

What are you doing?

Give me that.

What's wrong with you?

How would you like it?

Jeez-ah!

[taser zapping]

Put that away!

Walter!

Harold.

How's it going?

You must be Quinton?

Yeah, it Quilton, actually.

Quilton?

Yeah, like a quilt.

Oh, and your parents
named you that?

Family names.

Very artistic!

You know what, Namita?

why don't get these guys
the VIP pizza rolls,

that little area?

And give them triple pepperoni!

On the house.

Enjoy. Here we go, there it is.

Hey, and everyone,
I want y'all to know

that black lives
absolutely matter!

Probably more than ours!

Definitely more than ours!

I mean, haven't we
screwed it up enough?

[crowd mumbling in agreement]

So, black lives matter at
this tournament especially.

[exhales sharply]

Big Slams is coming up fired up.

[grunts loudly]

[sighs sharply]

Man, I get mad about that.

Am I the only one
that misses Obama?

Am I right here?

Jeez!

[sighs sharply]

That guy had it going on.

And Michelle, can we
talk about Michelle?

[upbeat music]

This is the most beautiful
shit I've ever seen.

[speaks Spanish]

I'ma get you.

[upbeat hip hop music]

[roller blades screeching]

[laughs loudly]

You good?

Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

I'm just looking for
somebody for registration,

you know what I'm saying?

This is the Domino
Tournament, right?

Absolutely, this is
the Domino Tournament.

I'm a domino tournament.

You know, I'm a child prodigy.

Look, I'm a long line
of domino champion.

You know what I'm saying?

You're a prodigy?

Yeah. I ain't lost
since I was three.

I'm just here brother,
I'm just here to help you.

Matter fact, since
you're a prodigy,

I got something for you.

I wanna welcome you.

Take one of these
bralettes, man.

Registration right there.

And make yourself at home.

This is what this is about.

All right man,
thank you, brother.

A prodigy.

Well, I appreciate that, man.

Matter of fact, you
take two, take two.

Oh man, thank you, man.

I ain't know it was
gonna be like this man.

You know I got your back man.

Oh man, thank you.

Yes.

What's up buddy.
Hi.

I need to holler at you.

You got an appointment with
one of Jesus' disciples.

Let's go.

It's starting to pick up.

It's getting hot.

I'm excited.

Oh thank you.

[laughs loudly]

Do you love the Lord?

Oh yes, I love the
Lord, hallelujah.

Praise the Lord.

You know, because the
Lord says, don't be cruel,

'cause I will never
be that cruel to you.

You know.

it's my prerogative.

You know?

Didn't Bobby...

[objects clanking]

You're coming up in
here with bounced checks,

playing with me.

You thinks this is a game?

No, no, no.

It's not a game.

Listen, about that,

my wife, she must've put
a block on my account,

but good news,

I've got the gate money.

[chuckles softly]

You can take that.

You can have it.

Gate money?

giving me permission

to have my own fucking money?

I will cut a mother fucking
pie hole out of you.

Hold on.

You know what I mean,
you scared of this?

[gasps sharply]

Yeah, yeah.

Guess what, guess what?

I got three, 50
pound cockroaches.

The size of pit bulls right

[metal clanking]

You hear me?

Cockroaches?

Yeah, yeah.

God, no.

Hey, what?

Oh, you're gonna use
the Lord's name in vain?

No.
Huh?

I didn't.

In my fucking establishment?

Do you know I'm a man of God?

Clearly.

You got till 4:00
PM to come up with

my mother fucking scratch.

Okay.

Or I'ma have these
these cockroaches

bite the shit out of you.

You hear me?

[chains rattling]

Oh Lord, forgive me.

Cockroach, cockroaches?

[upbeat hip hop music]

[laughs loudly]

Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming out.

Oh, hi there.

So we're getting about to
get started in a minute.

Oh look, we got some
hotties coming in.

Just want y'all to know
we're gonna get this show

on the road.

So just sit back.

Yeah, sit back.

Time to party.

All right, let's hear
from DJ Dominoes.

Oh yeah.

Y'all know what time it is.

It's your girl DJ Dominoes.

[imitating horn sounds]

I'm here to drop knowledge
and drop some dope sport beat.

Not trying to hate, but I
taught her everything she knows.

Facts.

Let's take a look at
our strongest contenders

as we enter the first round.

On table one, we have Tenspeed.

The highest ranked player
according to Liberty Parks,

top 10 winners.

He's most famously
here for his ability

to mind fuck opponents,
hard and deep

with no lubrication, y'all.

Somebody move all your asses.

Then there's big
slams on table two.

Who've been locked up
for the last 14 years

and it has shit else
to do but play bones

for 23 hours in his cell.

And on table three,
got Camilla Ines.

Known for her lewd and
downright nasty trash talk.

Oh, Ines is getting personal.

It looks like a family
rivalry is a brew

as her cousin Fredrico,
a big time champ himself

sits at table four.

On table five, we've
got Pimpdaddy fresh,

a retired pimp whose fashion
sense is a mix of mace,

bargain, late 2000s.

We don't really know.

But it doesn't seem like
Pimpdaddy has his opponent yet

as we wonder where the
great veteran Gerald Edges

has disappeared to?

Somebody find me a man.

Where are you at? [indistinct]

Are you hanging out
with aunt Jemimah?

What's you doing?

All right.

So you have a flip
phone, so texting is out.

Okay, this is three, five.

This is four, six.

And if you have any doubles,

it can be, oh, Lord,
it's hot in here.

All right?

Get it?

Yeah, I got it, I'm
black and I see now,

and it ain't that
damn difficult.

Yeah, it's not like
talking with girls

or anything like that, right?

Hell you're talking about?

Well, I was just wondering

if I help you with dominoes,

maybe you can help
me learn about women?

Oh, shucks.

Hormones raging, huh?

Okay, ain't nothing
more beautiful in life

than finding the
love of a good woman

'cause you'll never
be able to find one

half as good as mine

'cause my Ella May
was the greatest woman

that ever graced
this green earth.

Having love is like pure magic.

There's no greater feeling.

Losing it is like a
repeated kick in the ass

with a steel toed boot.

That damn Tenspeed got her ring.

That's the only memory
of her I got left.

I don't wanna lose it for life.

Not while I'm still half alive.

He beat him in the losing
in last tournament.

We got to win it back.

All right, let's get it back.

But what you were
talking about with girls,

I think I found my Ella May.

Look, we don't have
a lot of time left,

so we're gonna have to do
a crash course, all right?

Two things I'ma give you.

A, [indistinct whispering]


And lastly, about you
random motherfuckers

who are definitely gonna lose.

[exclaims loudly]

It looks like Gerald
Edges has finally decided

to come on through and play.


[chuckles softly]

Uncle Ben.

Did you just climb
out of your rice box?

Man. I want all these
beautiful people

to watch me whoop your ass.

And there ain't gon' be no
sympathy here Papa Bones.

Although, I would like
to formally thank you

for the invention
of peanut butter.

That shit is good as fuck.

Especially with jelly, goddam.

George
Washington[indistinct]looking ass.

Lemme tell you what.

What?

Get on up, so we can get down.

Oh man. What was
that from the 50s?

Goddam, get on up
so we can get down.

There were no cars
when you was born, sir.

All right, all
right, all right.

About to play some dominoes.

And no sore losers up in here.

Y'all got it?

Let's keep it cute, Compton.

Let's get it.

[sighs softly]

I'm about to tear your ass up.

Come on with
the big six again.

Is this sponsored by ARP?

Got you right there.

[sighs softly]

Come on.

What you got?

Nickel.

Nickel.

Alfred Lord Tennyson.

What the fuck that is.

How does that feel, Gerald?

Painful?

Do you got your
arthritis acting up?

Oh, a dumb ass mistake
from Gerald Edges.

He must be getting old

or is it that
dementia kicking in?

What's wrong pops?

Come on man.

Ah, that's right.

Circle of life Mufasa, the old
clearing out for the young.

Your time is up.


[laughs loudly]

Go get this ass whooping boy.

[laughs loudly]

Yeah, legendary Tenspeed.

Yeah, I heard about
your motherfucking ass.

Guess what?

What's that?

I ain't scared
of your bitch ass.

My momma told me all about you.

You ain't nothing but a
motherfucking crack head.

All this time I've been
fucking your mama nigga

it's the first time she
telling you about me bitch?

And it should have been your
daddy that told you about me

motherfucker.

And just don't disrespect me

with an unlit cigarette

and you taught me to cocaine?

What the fuck crack head
cocaine do many things.

I do cocaine motherfucker.

I do the finest shit
in the Peruvian.

Come on, I defeat
everything I do.

And next time I fuck your mama,

I'ma tell her to keep
your ass in the house.

10.

15.

First of all, I didn't
hear shit you said.

Is your mustache too big?

And I will suck your bitch ass
but you ain't gonna feel it.

Oh you're a genius, huh?

You real slick with your
motherfucking mouth.

Let me tell you something

you little irrelevant
motherfucker.

20.

It ain't never too
late for an abortion.

So you should shut
your goddam mouth.

You see what I'm saying?

What?

Dominoes, that's
what motherfucker.

[screams loudly]

I'm about to tear your ass up.

46, 46 trombones
in the big parade.

It looks like
I spoke too soon.

Gerald is racking up points.

The fuck he is.

Very white.

The fu...

Two four, three five.

Hey.

Sorry, I have Tourette's.

Tickle that teat.

Security, security.

Oysters.

Some kind of commotion
going on in the crowd.

We're gonna have the
monitors take a look.

25 big booty bitches bouncing.

[domino bangs]

Shocker, shocker, doing
the pink, what a stink.

Dominoes.

Stop.

Tell your
grandmamma I said hey.

She'll remember me.

And a huge come from behind
victory from Gerald Edges.

Congratulations.

You must start taking your
fish oil halfway through

I see that.

[chuckles softly]

Ooh, Camilla Ines is looking
surprisingly shaky out there.

You know, I've been meaning
to ask you this all game.

Aside from the fact
that you are dressed

like Cleo from "Set It Off,"

how does it work when
you're in the bathroom?

Like are you standing up?

Are you sitting down?

Are you on there backwards?

What are you doing?

Well, I'll be
standing only when

it's in your momma's mouth.

[giggles loudly]

Nasty.

You should make
sure you hold onto her

before you lose her.

Call her and shit.

All right?

What?

Are you good?

Are you okay?

Are you having a mental
breakdown right now?

Are you suffering
from identity crisis?

You wanna write your
feelings in your diary?

Huh?

Go ahead, you got time.

You can have a
whole lot of time.

I'm just be over here,
spanking that ass.

Who the hell invited Mr. old
town road to this tournament?

See, this is gentrification
at its finest.

I'm telling you.

Miguel, right?

Vandersloot, right?

Good to see you.

You too, man.

You build that wall yet?

Working on it.

Let it rip.

Boom.

There you go, Willie Nelson.

Come on, let me see
what you on there.

Well, it's anything
like last time.

You know exactly how this goes.

Mmh okay, that means I'm
gonna leave out of here a winner

and you get to go
back to your cousins.

That's exactly what that means.

[chuckles softly]

Boom, there we go.

Okay.

15, put a lasso around
your ass for that one, huh?

Hey, well, sorry to
disappoint you 'cause,

domino bitch.

[crowd cheering]

That's right.

Oh, you're gonna
cry now, aren't you?

Look, I know it hurts.

[cheering loudly]

Willie Nelson
looking motherfucker.

Come on, get out of here.

â™ª I'm gonna take my horse â™ª
to the hell out of here â™ª

Get yo ass up out
the damn chair.

That's right.

Seems like it's officially
national douche bag day

as Fredrico wins his
first game, advancing on.

[grunts loudly]

Camilla still struggling.

You know, I hope
you learn from this.

I truly, truly hope
you learn from this

and find out what
happened when you fuck

with the superior sex.

Look at this goddam shirt.

I look like a African pill.

Kick his cheat ass.

I have, I learned that
having a dick means,

if you try hard enough, you
can always go fuck yourself.

Dominoes.

Get the fuck out
of here Bernie Mac.

[cheers loudly]

Man, wait a minute.

Where did this even come from?

Somebody check her.

[speaks foreign language]

Lets swing the
action onto table two.

Look like big Slam is coming
for blood on them bones.

You remember that bitch
you wasted at the park blood?

Bitchuation? What the
hell is a bitchuation?

[exclaims loudly]

Oh, you talking
about the situation

when you beat the
black off old dude

for hitting you
with a basketball

and I might have ran away?

Kinda, yeah. I know what
you're talking about.

Yeah, word on the street
is bloody got knocked out,

and he ain't wake up yet.

He taken a nap?

He had to be in the hospital.

In the boma, blood.

You mean a coma?

I mean a boma?

Police are looking everywhere
for the nigga that did it.

I wonder who did it.

They checking for witnesses too.

Hold up, witnesses?

You bee anything Balvin?

Did I see anything?

I mean, did I bee anything?

Hell no, I ain't bee anything.

Do it look like I can bee
any damn thing right now?

If I find out somebody's
snitching a bump

on their gums about me.

Well, I ain't got

'Cause you got my back, right?

Technically you

So I got partial of it.

I'm just saying if I find
a nigga snitching on me

in my proximity again,
I'ma changed man blood,

but on the set, I'll kill blood.

You said you're gonna kill him?

Absolutely nigga, I

Something ain't right.

Okay?

that little white kid.

That wippy kid?

Yes, the little chunky one.

The one who fails to do sit ups.

What's up?

That one.

That motherfucker
is up to something.

What, what is it?

Ain't no way a white kid
hang out with a black man

if they're not being kidnapping.

Ain't no ransom involved
if you don't hang out

with a little white kid.

That's what I told ya
I'll to get to my fault.

I'm going undercover and
tryna find out what's wrong.

Did you get the mics?

We got it, we got it.

[clears throat]

So, our fish was
pretty great, right?

Yeah, sushi gives me gas.

I'll regret it later,
as will your mother.

Our marriage will
be tested tonight.

Papa, come on, please.

Leaving without me now?

This has gone far
enough, Camilla.

You need to stop now.

You need to quit the tournament

before you do even more
damage to this family.

No, no.

You're making a laughing
stock of all of us.

I'm not.
Yes.

Look, I know we
have our difference.

But how can you
treat me like this?

I'm still your daughter.

[speaks Spanish]


You're working with
the area motherfuckers?

I just wanted a Fresco.

My fault homie.

Old habits die hard you
know what I'm saying, blood?

You can't run up on me
like that from the back.

You know where I'm from
you get shanked homie.

Cool.

[upbeat hip hop music]

[laughs loudly]

I like you, Gerald.

I liked your
motherfucking old ass.

And the way you
slapped them bones,

you damn motherfucker.

Dude you slapped the
fuck out them bones.

And the next batch
is gonna come to us.

So why don't you
just go on ahead

and drown yourself and
all that upcoming hand.

You know what, Gerald,

let me tell you something, man.

I like you.

If a old motherfucker
did a lot for me,

and you made a way for
a young fighter player

motherfucker like
myself to do what I do.

I'm telling you something,
that little fat white boy,

he's a little
chucky motherfucker

you're running around with
playing up Mr. Rogers with.

That motherfucker
is up to something.

And up to nothing.

That's my son's new
stepson, all right?

Yeah.

Him and his mom have been
living this white privilege life

living off their hard work.

Fuck you doing?

I'm just checking man.

Just say what you gotta say.

But he's a little fat
roly polis son of a gun.

I got arrested of
their life, you know?

But they just left them on me.

I don't know what he does.

I don't know where
he goes to school.

I don't even know his last name.

You know. How the fuck
white people will come

to hood just yelling.

Six, four.

Everybody know six
four on domino.

That's some bullshit, Gerald.

So goddam bullshit, Gerald.

So why don't you just
forget about this little

Cheddar Bay biscuits eating boy

and focus on the one who's
gonna fuck your life up

better than a
NyQuil [indistinct]

I like that, Gerald.

I like that.

There you go.

That's some bullshit like daddy.

Take this guy down,
fuck that bullshit.

Sup Slams?

You look like they
revoke you bro.

Competition here is
tough as hell man.

And I need that,
my girl dumped me.

Well that sucks.

What happened?

What do you do?

I ain't do nothing.

Do you try talking to her?

I tried talking to her but

she ain't trying
to hear that shit.

Now she's scared of
me all of a sudden.

I feel you, man.

How long have you
two been together?

About two and a half hours.

I know it ain't a long time,
but it was real, you know?

[upbeat music]

If it isn't popping fresh,
you get your shit together?

Oh, you gonna try to
fool me like you did,

when y'all was yelling
out all that slick shit.

How can I help you Mr. Speed?

Actually is me who
wanna help you to see

there's a rumor going around

that your little
chunky ass is more

than the cocktail spectator.

Some say you're the
greatest ever did this shit.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

I don't know
what to talk about.

Yeah, and you and Gerald
trying to fool me,

running around here
like y'all best of kins

and this little
interracial family shit.

But I'ma tell you
something you don't know

little chunky fella.

Guess what?

Gerald don't even like your ass.

You don't believe me?

Listen to this.

That's my son's new stepson,
they just left him on me.

I don't know what he does.

I don't know where
he goes to school.

I don't even know his last name.

See, you goddam step kid.

He been using your ass

and he been using me too.

You don't even like it?

He don't give a fuck about you.

Listen to this little fat boy.

But he is a little fat growing
son of a gun [indistinct].

Yeah kid, go on crying.

She used to cry [indistinct]

What's going on?

What's wrong with you?

Game's about to
start in a minute.

Hey, where the
hell are you going?

Home, I'm ordering an Uber.

Maybe look it up.

What?

We're about to win the
whole damn thing kid.

I don't wanna play anymore

and I definitely
don't wanna be related

to you anymore either.

[door creaking]

What the hell just happened?

[hip-hop music]

We're back bitch.

And it's time for some lip
smacking, bone slapping fellas.

Is y'all ready?

All right everybody,
take your seats.

We're about to start
the final round of WDC.

[Crowd cheering and clapping]

Come on DJ Dominoes
hit it with the beat!

Guys we got some
investors in the house.

Big up to the
bankers in the back.

You know what's
great about bankers?

They always have money.

Y'all watch busy bagels.

Is this organic chorizo or...

Oh yeah.

No, I'm good.

[dominoes rattling]

I'm not feeling too

I'm gonna take a minute.

It's a vibe.

'Cause this here is the big one.

We've got Ines vs Ines,

where the fans loyalty lies.

Well, well what's

I mean, I would
think you'd be used

to it by now [speaks Spanish]

[chuckles softly]

I swear this isn't
even fun anymore.

Hey, hey you promised me
a fight not a massacre.

[speaks in Spanish]

Thea, she's got five.

Is that seriously
the best you got?

Oh sweetheart you're frazzled.

[sniffs loudly]

What's that smell?

Did you get your period?

Oh okay no, no, no it
must be your hair braided

too tight.

Either way I think
you worked out

on me beating you
bloody [speaks Spanish]

Thank God for the red table.

This is starting to look
pretty bad for the one

and only Dominica.

Oh, you're gonna cry, right?

No don't do it right here.

Fuck this bullshit.

If I'm going down, I'll be
sure to bite your dick off

when I'm there.

[speaks in Spanish]

Thea.

But I'm your nephew.

[speaks Spanish]

Bro get your wife,
who are you smiling at?

Camilla

[crowd cheering]

You boys may think dominoes
is machismo game huh!

The thing you boys
forget about dominoes

is that the bones might
be hard and loud and cold

but the only thing anyone
actually gives a fuck

about out of those
little periods

laying enough together
on every side.

[speaks Spanish] motherfucker.

[laughs loudly]

What the fuck?

You gotta be...

Come on, man.

[crowd cheering]

[crowd applauding]

And the party don't stop

heaviest hitters go

[speaks foreign language]

[upbeat hip hop music]

I got that
activated [indistinct]

Man, come on man.

What about this?

No, you gotta go home, bro.

You've got to like that.

Tenspeed, what did
you do to that boy?

When the fuck you
start giving a fuck about

a motherfucker you don't give
a fuck about motherfucker?

Who's a motherfucker?

You are a motherfucker.

Oh, so little squirty
you wanna fight dirty, huh?

Why don't we just cut the
games and throw down clown?

1974 style a box,
I don't give a fuck.

Put them up.

I'll knock your old ass out.

I'm about to knock the
wrinkles out of your grandma.

Swing bitch, that's right.

Die right now motherfucker.

You deserve it,
you deserve to die.

It's my heart.

Fuck your heart, nigga.

My Angina.

Fuck your aunt vagina and
the rest of them bitches.

You cool O.G?

It's like your grandmamma
is sitting on my chest.

Fuck your chest.

Die, why are you

It's the big one Ella May.

God, why are you still
taking so goddam long

the devil wouldn't
have been [indistinct]

I'm coming.

Don't you come over

Mr. Edges.

Fuck this nigga.

We should get you

No, no, no, no.
Fucker.

I just need to get
the blood pumping again.

I ain't quitting.

Okay, let me get

Let him die.

You okay?

[breathing laboriously]

Well everything seems normal

but you have to take it easy.

No more fighting. Promise?

Promise.

You promise to do
something for me?

But that is the
saddest I've ever seen.

We're in front of white
people in bow ties.

Can't take y'all niggas nowhere.

The footage is great.

I mean, twists and turns,
drama around every corner.

This is gonna be good,
real good, you know?

But I'm a hustler.

I get it done.

What's up buddy?

Though I'd pray for you.

Come on man, come to
my office, you know.

Prayer changes.

Okay.

And I realize, you know,
you're on my property,

I haven't prayed for you.

Okay.

Put your hand on the Bible.

Now look motherfucker,
it's 4:00 PM.

The bank is closed.

Now, somebody about to lose
some motherfucking fingers

if I don't get my cash.

Okay, listen.

I can't, I tried, I
don't have the money.

Don't please, wait, wait, wait.

I don't even have
the prize money yet.

I'm hoping that this
film blows up, you know.

That's why I invited
the investors down

but I am 20 grand
in the hole myself.

Oh, for real?
Yeah.

That's some shit.

I'm desperate,
I'll do anything,

just give me a few
more hours, please.

So you want me to
give a few more hours?

Well, you, my friend are in luck

because the Lord has anointed
me to get my certification

to be a same day lender.

Oh, that's convenient.

So you can sign right there

and I can loan you money
for the next 45 minutes.

Okay.

Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah.

God is good.

Where's my money?

Oh, white Jesus.

That's your credit.

That's right, that's the savior,

He saved your ass today.

All right.

It's gonna be good.

It's gonna be real good.

[sniffs loudly]

Big, big [indistinct]

[laughs loudly]


Big wink wink [laughs]

Look, wink, wink.

I want to have your
big homies know

that the first time you caught
a case at nine years old,

you got caught stealing
some goddam twinkies.

You was a motherfucking
twinky gangster.


Nigga with the cream filling.

Then give me 15 while you
sitting there thinking.

Who the fuck
told you that shit?

Your grandmother.

She's a sweet lady.

Grandma always talking shit.

Running her fucking mouth.

Hating ass bitch.

Still in that halfway house?

So tell me, when
did you get out?

I spend 175 days in the hole.

Nothing but darkness and the
sound of my own heartbeat,

blood sweeping through
my veins, homie.

Hey shit you can do
that can break me.

I been through
everything, blood.

Give me that 20.

[laughs loudly]

You like that, huh?

Congratulations on
your new relationship.

How the fuck you
know about Sherry?

Sherry?

EBP?

What the fuck is EBP, blood?

Nigga, that's
everybody person.

And don't even get mad.

I fucked twice.

The pussy barely decent, you
shouldn't be getting that mad.

Uh Oh!

I can't hear what they're saying

but it looks like Tenspeed
found his opening.

Fuck you, nigga.

Oh, you wanna fuck me now?

Prison must have really
clean the best of you.

Listen nigga, get
off your feelings.

Calm down.

Everybody's neighborhood
say good things about her.

Here, see, hold on, look
at that pretty smile,

ain't she gorgeous?

What the fuck is this?

That was her in
church with her grandma.

She sending you
pictures, nigga?

That was just at church.

Ain't that smile pretty?

Oh, this one you might like.

Don't that smile look pretty?

With my dick in her mouth?

Oh shit, slam is
about to lose it y'all.

Everybody get down.

This negro finna blow.

Everybody hit the deck.


[objects rumbling]
[dominoes crashing]

[indistinct mumbling]
[taser buzzing]

[muffled screaming]

[phone ringing]


Hey Andy, it's Namita.


Hey, I don't know
where you are right now

but can I talk to
you real quick?


I'm outside on the steps.

Okay, cool, I'll
be right there.

There you are.

Everyone's worried about you.

I really doubt that.

Oh Andy, of course
they're worried about you.

You've become quite
the talk around here.

Damn!

A tragic loss for one of
the best to bang the bone.

Everybody get the fuck down.


[wailing loudly]

Anybody wanna try some
shit I'll put your ass down

just like him.

Damn, I need a better agent.

Oh, hell no cuz.
Fuck this shit.

Hey, get your
big ass over there.

Hurry up.

Yeah, nigga, make a move and
I promise I started bursting.

Yeah, all right.

Put your hands in
the air fat wink wink.

Do some.

Get your tiny
ass on the ground.

Please, I have several
adult rescue cats.

Hand cuff yourself.

Everybody is scared except me.

I ain't scared of shit.

Hurry the fuck up.

Ah, I'm trying.

Yeah, that figures.

Sad, lonely white kid
that nobody loves.

I'm sure they're all laughing.

You know I'm different too.

When I first came here, it
was hard for me to fit in.

People judge me by my outside.

But you know, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

You just can't
always see through

the rough exterior sometimes.

My parents don't
even care about me.

They're too busy focusing
on their own lives

and Cabo or whatever.

I'm sure that's
not true, not really.

Like your granddad, they
may be distracted sometimes,

but people tend to come
around when the dust settles.

You think so?

I do, family's
for life after all.


[upbeat music]

Move it here.

Fill the fucking
bag [indistinct]

Fuck you're looking at.

Trick or treat mother fucker.

This is [indistinct]

I think you might be the
first real friend I've ever had.

Well, I doubt that, but I
am definitely your friend now.

So what do you say we
get back in there...

Namita, can I
ask you a question?

Do you have a boyfriend?

And what's reverse cow girl?

Is it like a
time-traveling lady cowboy?

I'm going to time travel

and pretend that last three
seconds never happened.

Right now, we need to get
back to check on your grandad.

He had an accident trying
to defend your honor

against Tenspeed.

Where is he?

Is he okay?

Tenspeed better
not have hurt him.

Let's go.

Anybody else got
something to say?

And who the fuck is you?

Get the fuck in here.

Huh?

And get the fuck over there,

you hear the fuck I'm saying?

There's a fucking gun,
man, put that shit down.

Grab the fucking hook.

You're ruining everything.

Okay, yeah, pass the
bag around[indistinct]

[speaks Spanish]

[yells in Spanish]

[crowd screaming]

My blood pressure is too much.

[speaks Spanish]

[crowd screaming]

Motherfucker.

Bitch get the fuck off.

What's wrong with you?

Tenspeed, bitch.

[crowd screaming]

Oh hell yeah.

Where y'all going,
the motherfucker's dead?

wrong with you?

No, no, no, no, no, stay.

Everybody stay in here.

Not in my house, they're
not gonna stop my dreams.

Look, what just happened
was a horrible experience.

And I'm sure it's gonna
cost me thousands more

in medication, therapy,

which I absolutely do not have.

But just stop for a second
and think about it, okay?

Listen, some of you paid
a perfectly reasonable,

but not minuscule price
to be in this tournament.

And some of you spent
your hard-earned money

to come out here and see the
world's best dominoes players

go for the grand prize.

$10,000, $10,000

that has still not been claimed.

I have it right here.

Now, are you seriously
willing to walk away

from what we've started?

What we're part of?

History.

Just because a couple of
trick ass gangsters choose

to disrupt our championship?

Fuck those guys.

Fuck those guys.

Now, who are the
winners in this place?

Huh?

Is it us or is it them?

'Cause I went on a search all
through South Los Angeles,

terrifying journey to
find the best of the best.

And those are the winners
that stand before you today.

And for one of you,

the title, the
respect, the glory

is still yours for the taking.

[crowd cheers]

As long as you don't
let those losers win,

we just keep fighting
for our dreams.

[crowd cheering]

Now, who's with me?

I mean, come on.

[crowd cheering]

Yeah, yeah.

[crowd cheering]

It's party time, let's
get this started.

[crowd cheering]

[Police Officer] LAPD.

Hello officer.

There's just been
an armed robbery.

[Police Officer] All right.

How quickly can you be here?

[Police Officer]
What's your location?

We're in Compton.

[Police Officer]
Oh, I don't think

we can make it out there.
There's white people here.

[Police Officer]
Oh, in that case,

we'll be there in two minutes.

Okay, great, thank you.

Papa we should get
you to the hospital.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[speaks Spanish] I'm fine.

Are you okay?

I don't know what
I would have done.

If they'd hurt you.

I'm fine Papa.

Listen.

Dominoes was never
about pretending

to be something I'm not.

It's actually the only time

I've been able to
be who I really am.

But maybe this is a sign that
maybe this is not for me.

No [speaks Spanish]

No, no, no, no,
no, no stop Camilla.

Listen.

I was wrong too.
No.

No, you [speaks Spanish]

are strong.

You have got more balls than
that punk cousin of yours.

[speaks Spanish]

[laughs loudly]

[speaks Spanish]

You can be whoever you wanna be.

You're still my baby girl.

Papa, that's
all I ever wanted.

[sobs loudly]

I gotta say, Walter, what
we've seen here today has been-

Real, right?

Quite the experience.

Yeah a bit too
real for my blood,

but, hey, thank you for
an unforgettable ride.

So unreal.

I guess suddenly will
start their work then.

What work, sir?

Well, you guys as
producers must know

that the real in
reality television

isn't really what it seems.

That security guard you think
he's a real security guard?


Actor!

What?

Oh, hell yeah.
No, no way.

Genius.

No, no.

Those dudes that
came in, actors.

Wardrobe, acting, all
of it guys, come on.

Why are you gonna do
one cheap promo piece,

when you can get hours
of ad sponsored footage

for a reality television show?

I see it.

You see it?

I mean it's it's yeah, it's-

What about this
one right here?

Yeah, actor.
No.

[laughs loudly]

So real.
Yeah?

You don't know man I almost
shit my pants I was crowning.

Oh yeah?
Prairie dogging it.

Oh yeah, me too.
Am so thankful.

Me too I was into it.

Yeah.
Yeah.

I mean that
speech you felt wow.

I felt it.
Well, now I'm in it.

Like now we are in.

You're in it?

We are in.
Yeah, yeah.

Do you guys want
some of the Forty?

Yeah, what is that?
What is that?

Mr. Edges, I heard
you're sick, are you okay?

You just took down a
crazy ass bitch with a gun

and you worried about me?

Only white folks.

Well, yeah, I saw you
forgot this at home.

So I grabbed them just in case.

They are for your heart, right?

Yeah.

But ain't nothing wrong
with my heart boy.

This is nothing this little
pills can take care of.

I ain't got it no more.

I've been weak out there.

I was faking just to buy time

and now I realized that,

ain't no more time
in this game for me.

Time for some new blood.

You're the one that got us here.

You the man now Andy.

I want you to go over
there, take my place.

I want you to show
the world what we got.

Me against Tenspeed?

Against the world
starting with Tenspeed.

He's gonna roll over
and crush me though.

He ain't crushing you boy.

You smarter than
all these people.

You've proven it to me
now prove it to yourself.

You're ready.

All right?
Okay.

Now I want you to
go on over there,

when you sit down, I
want you to represent us.

Okay.

Him for me.

[upbeat hip hop music]

It's been a wild
night tonight guys,

but let's get back into it.

We have a last minute change
for our championship round.

We got Gerald Pablo Bones,

he's passing his seat seat
onto his grandson, Andy Edges.

Get him youngster.

Go on.

And this is it.

Andy Edges is growing up fast

as he sits in for
his ailing grandad.

Is good versus evil.

Purity and innocence,
versus a heart

of the blackest midnight.

Hey, bitch, what you doing
that old racist shit for?

Fuck you calling midnight bitch?

Hey fuck you Tenspeed.

I hope a Lego falling
your skate boots,

how about that?

Now let's fucking domino.

[crowd applauding]

Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy,
Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy.

What the fuck

[upbeat hiphop music]

Let's go, shake em.

â™ª Activated, all ma â™ª
niggas fully activated â™ª

â™ª Activated push your button â™ª
watch me activate it â™ª

Hit six.

Bam!

15 like that.

You know one thing
going on about dominoes?

It ain't about no
goddamn app [indistinct]

It's not about that shit.

It's mental.

This is all about psychology,

and to win the mental game,

you gotta know people Andy.

You gotta know their strengths,

[bangs table loudly]

you gotta know their weaknesses,

[bangs table loudly]

but most of all,

you gotta know what makes them

[bangs table loudly]
buckle, under pressure.

See, you don't know people.

Just a loser.

You just a little
chunky, obese little boy

loudly] in Tenspeed house.

Now,

[bangs table loudly]

Tenspeed officially revealing
he was raised by wolves,

is going in on Andy,

Can we please contact
child protective services

[bangs table
loudly] on the line?

[bangs table loudly]

Give me 10.

Like to count Andy?

[bangs table loudly]

Give me 25.

Think about everything
you're doing.

Yeah.

In the hood when you fuck up,

some time you got to get out

[bangs table loudly]

other times you gotta
go to the ball yard.

Oh Tenspeed with the blocks
as Andy keeps the digging.

But goddamn, I know he
is a human skid mark,

but the nigga can show domino.

Another one.

Oh, try again

and again.

Look Andy Edges,
digging his own grave.

Don't follow the light Andy,

don't follow the light.

You better call on Jesus.

Don't follow the light.

Shut the fuck up, can't
you see he is trying

to concentrate?

Oh, ungrateful ass nigga.

You don't win at bones unless
you get in the folks head,

the game is all mental.

[bangs table loudly]

That's 10 bitch.

[crowd cheers loudly]

Mr. Tenspeed Sir.

That's me there,
that's my grandson.

[crowd cheers loudly]

Wow, Andy Edges noting
the comeback is essential.

15 Sir.

Looking not so little man, go.

You think we having fun?

Get in Andy.

Winning ain't fun
until it is won.

Won is fun.

He's moments away
from taking it home.

That's 10 looks
like five to go.

Oh, looks like it's
all over for Tenspeed.

There is a God.

Is he heading for the boneyard?

Fucking brilliant.

[solemn classical music]

You only need five to go, jeez.

But not that jeez, domino!

Little mother fucker,
you can't beat me.

Talking about the
mind, psychology.

Go on over there you goddamn
loser, that's the game.

[domino crashing]

[cheers loudly]

Damn, what kind
of bullshit is that?

Well, I guess that means
Tenspeed wins, yippee.

Now let me take my
ass and get a drink.

And the winner is Tenspeed.

[wails loudly]


[laughs loudly]

Focus on the money,
let's focus on the money.

Oh, oh, oh.

Yeah, focus on the
honey lady there.

And I wanna give a big shout out

to drugs.

Because they try to
make you think drugs

ain't good for you,

they're lying to you man.

Some of the greatest ever
did, it was on drugs.

I wanna thank Nino Brown
from New Jack city.

I wanna thank Rollo
for a good time.

Johnny Cash, 'cause like
he said, I did it my way.

You are my first interracial
friendship and without you,

I mean shit it still be the same

but I'm really
emotional at this point.

Only the world know
that I deserve this.

The American dream ladies
and gentlemen, you saw it here.

The World Dominoes Championship.

Keep your head up.

It's not you.

Your grandfather ain't
shit, never been shit.

I been kicking his
ass his whole life.

And guess what?

If I'm number one, that
make you number two.

And guess I got
something for you.

You keep that little
chunky [indistinct]

[somber music]

You done good.

I'm proud of you anyway.

But I didn't get your ring.

No, no, no.

I'm proud of you because in
spite of all this trash talk

you stood up to a bully

and earned everyone's
respect, especially mine.

You stood firm when
someone was trying

to put fear in you.

That's the very first thing
every black man learns

in this society.

So maybe you coming around,

grandson.

Look Andy, he can have it.

I'm good.

Mr. Tenspeed wanted
me to have this.

What?

Boy don't be taking
that from that guy?

Could be anything.

What's in there?

Is this Ella May's ring?

Yeah, I don't give a damn
about no ring no more son,

I got you.

Thanks granddad.

Hey, I still got her
panties though nigga.

[yells loudly]

[door bangs loudly]

[shouts loudly]

And where are you going?

You know what?

You were clearly a pimp at
some point, am I correct?

But now I'm
pimping for the Lord

and don't nobody take
the Lord's money.

'Cause that's my money.

You understand what I'm saying?

Now where the fuck
is my money at?

Good news, good news.

I got an advance on
the reality show and

[laughs loudly]

Hey man, that's bad.
Yeah

That's bad, Sam.

Thank you, Lord.

Thank you, Jesus.

Now about that inches.

Oh yeah.

Yeah.

White Jesus?

Oh white Jesus,
Holy Lord white Jesus.

All right, we're good now.

No, no, no, like the
paperwork you signed

Interest.
The collateral, white Jesus.

Okay, well what could the
interest be on a 45 minute?

Let's see, 45, 58%.

See, see, see.

You know what your
problem is, Walter?

You shouldn't sign shit
under duress, right?

Ah shit.

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

Now I got to cut
the shit out of you?

No.

Yeah, I gotta cut
you, I gotta cut it.

You don't have to cut me.

I have to because
you know why?

Why?

People think I'm
old school, see?

They think I preach
out the Old Testament.

Old Testament preaching, dude.

I'm more like a New Testament.

Oh shit, I'm ordained,
I'm an ordained Minister.

[grunts loudly]

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

I'm anointed.

How many fathers smite him?

I don't believe in the
effectiveness of your


Come on come on big
guy. Come on big guy.

And I survived with
all my fingers.

You know what Namita,

I could not have done
this without you.

Why don't we make
this permanent?

I'm gonna make you
vice president of WDC.

That's right.

You're the new vice president.

You know how real is that?

I don't know what to say.

Good.

Because I got a lot of
thoughts going through my head

and I don't want you

"Man, what you doing?"

He was like "Man, I'm over

And he was making these
sexy balloons and I said,

"Why don't you come on down

and be an entrepreneur?"

So now we've got
the erotic balloons.

urge to run a 58.

58 miles, man I thought
the tournament was over,

which is crazy.

'Cause I'm ready to go.

I'm ready to rock.

So I just got a lot
of energy right now.

That's the only one to
stand to stay apart.

Anybody wanna build it.

Build a house.


Nah, I didn't get to play.

Right now, I feel like if you
put dominoes in front of me,

I could build an
origami out of dominoes.

You ain't never seen
that shit like that.

Thirsty on parts?


You don't just sit down and
just cordially play dominoes.

What a motherfucker.

Hey, nice hands.
