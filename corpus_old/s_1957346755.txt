[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

[THUNDER CRASHING]

[LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING]

[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

Youâ€™re talkinâ€™
through your ear,
Snoose.

The Middle Fork
and the Feather River
have been worked clean.

There ainâ€™t no gold there.
You sayinâ€™ Iâ€™m lyinâ€™, Amos?

Heâ€™s not sayinâ€™ that,
Snoose.

Stupid poundinâ€™
horseshoes.

A couple brothers washed out
$1100 in one pan.

That is an old story,
Snoose, and it ainâ€™t true.

I had my first claim
on the Feather.
It was clean then.

You know, Jimmy,
any gold you got
belonged to somebody else.

Snoose,
stop talkinâ€™ like that.
Jimmyâ€™s no thief.

He hides dust in the collar
of that ugly dog of his.
I seen him do it.

Come on!

[MUSIC STOPS]

Oh, not in here.
Now knock it off!

SOPHIE: Stop!

Iâ€™m sorry, Miss Sophie.
You all right?

Ow! You bit me!

Get outside! Now get out!

Come on, Snoose, come on!
Give it to me!

Come on,
you son of a gun!

[JIMMY YELLING]

JIMMY: Snoose, Iâ€™m gonna
eat your liver.

[SNOOSE AND JIMMY YELLING]

Stop!

Uh, may I help you?

Is this Lucky Diggins?

Yes, it is.

This is Scatterâ€™s Saloon.
Iâ€™m Mr. Scatter.

You are?

Iâ€™m Mrs. Arvella Whipple
from Buttonfields,
Massachusetts.

We answered your advertisement
in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle
</i> to run your boardinghouse.

Weâ€™re here.

Um, ahem, so you are.

I didnâ€™t expect you so soon,
Mrs. Whipple,

and I didnâ€™t expect
youâ€™d be bringing your family.

You think
Iâ€™d discard them somewhere?

No.

Whereâ€™s your husband,
Mrs. Whipple?

Dead. May I please
see the boardinghouse?

Oh.

Right this way.
Come, children.

This is it.

This isnâ€™t
a boardinghouse,
itâ€™s a tent.

Itâ€™s a boarding tent.

About the only houses
in Lucky Diggins
are outhouses.


Go on, children.
Go on in.

Weâ€™re buildinâ€™
a real boardinghouse, though.

We only have three boarders
at the present time.

Iâ€™ve been tryinâ€™
to get more,

but with some of the miners
wantinâ€™ to be closer
to the river,

well, I havenâ€™t had
much luck so far.

I can see why.

SCATTER: Yeah.

If you just follow me outside,
thereâ€™s a tent for you.

It might be a bit small
for four.

The payâ€™s $10 a month.

Could be more if your
cookingâ€™s any good.
It isnâ€™t.

This tent is too small
for four squirrels,
Mr. Scatter.

I trust youâ€™ll replace it
with a larger one
in the morning.

Huh.
Go in, quick, quick.

Weâ€™re not actually
really staying here,
are we, Mama?

Of course we are,
California.

We didnâ€™t come all this way
just to turn around
and go back.

Just wait until morning,
children.

I bet itâ€™s a fine place.

[MEN CHATTERING]

[HORSES NEIGHING]



You know,
I havenâ€™t seen any riverbeds
paved with gold, Mama,

or fruit hanging
from every tree.

All I see is mud
and leaky tents

and more dirty men
than Iâ€™ve ever seen
in my entire life.

Well, look again, California.
You just open your eyes,
you might like it.

Iâ€™ll never like it.

If Pa were here,
heâ€™d see how horrible it was

and heâ€™d take us home
immediately.

We are home,
and weâ€™re gonna be happy here.

Your pa would see
how beautiful it is.

If you canâ€™t see it,
donâ€™t spoil it
for the rest of us.

Yeah, California.
I like it here.

I like it here too.

Itâ€™s awful.

CALIFORNIA:
Weâ€™ve been here
over two weeks

and all weâ€™ve done
is work and work.

why Mr. Scatter
started this town?

This is where his mule died.

I mean, no decent town
ever started that way.

And now that
all the mud is gone,

thereâ€™s nothing but dust
covering everything.


I mean, are these
the wonderful...

Possibilities
you promised us?

[BUTTE AND PRAIRIE LAUGHING]

What you dumb
sons of bitches
donâ€™t know

is goldâ€™s not just
in the streams.
Itâ€™s in the hills too.

Thereâ€™ll be no swearing
in here, Mr. McGrath.
My children are present.

You should have stayed
in Massachusetts,
then, maâ€™am.

Apologize to Mrs. Whipple,
Snoose.

CARROTS: I donâ€™t think
he fathoms the concept
of table manners, maâ€™am.

The truth is, the easy gold
is gone, and we all know it.

JIMMY: It donâ€™t matter
if itâ€™s easy or hard.

Thereâ€™s gold out there
waitinâ€™ to be found.
It is needinâ€™ to be found.

Now, we seen the elephant,
and we ainâ€™t blinked.

And there ainâ€™t many men
that can say that,
nor dog neither. Hallelujah.

ALL: Hallelujah!
MAN: Praise God.

SNOOSE: You know, I dreamed
I hit pay dirt last night.

JIMMY: If you dream it,
it comes true.

SNOOSE: Mule poop.

[HORSE NEIGHING]

Excuse me.

Uh, Iâ€™ve seen you reading,
California.

You like books?

I love books.

But my mama
only let me bring 10,

and Iâ€™ve read them
so many times
the pages are falling out.

You really do like to read.

My nameâ€™s Joshua Beale,

but everyone here
calls me Carrots
on account of my hair.

I hate my name too.

My mama always dreamed
of going west,

and so she named us all
after things out here.

My brother is Butte
and my sister is Prairie,

and I have
the horrible misfortune

of being called
California Morning.


So, what are you
doing out here?

Well, uh,

oh, I was a lawyer

with no clients.

We, umâ€â€ Well, I decided
to make my fortune
in the gold fields,

but I havenâ€™t had
much luck yet.

What does
"seeing the elephant" mean?

Well, it means everything
about the gold rush.

The ordeal of getting here,

leaving your family
to dig for gold.

The joy of finding
even the tiniest nugget

and the heartbreak of not.

I wonder
what my pa would think
of this place.

I miss him so much sometimes
that it aches inside.

I think my maâ€™s forgotten
all about him.

Thatâ€™s not likely, miss.

SNOOSE:
Hallelujah!

Is anyone minding the store?

Sophie.

Iâ€™d like two pounds
of bear fat,
a quart of vinegar

and a sack of flour, please.

You get used to
this dust pit yet?

Well, not entirely,
but I like it here.

You like runninâ€™
Scatterâ€™s brokenâ€down,
smelly old boardinghouse?

Itâ€™s honest work.

Bull.

Everybody comes for gold.

I didnâ€™t.

I came here
to give my family
a better life.

And you picked
this muleâ€turd town
to follow your dream?

Howâ€™d your husband die?

Pneumonia.

Too bad.

Well, plenty of men
in Lucky Diggins
are lookinâ€™ for wives,

and theyâ€™re not lookinâ€™
at me.

Well, they best not
look at me, either.

How much?
Five dollars.

Iâ€™ll have Jonas
take it out of your wages.

Thank you.

CALIFORNIA:
<i>Dear Gram and Grampop,
well, weâ€™re here.</i>

<i>Thereâ€™s no school,
no church and no library.</i>

<i>Iâ€™m almost 14
and should not have to live</i>

<i>in a place
where people will die
to see elephants.</i>

<i>Mama thinks Lucky Diggins
is heaven, but I think
itâ€™s the other place.</i>

"...thou mayst overpower,
for God made women weak,
and..."

What am I supposed to do
with this?

Well, thereâ€™s meat
for to feed us
and our boarders,

so youâ€™ve gotta
shoot some rabbits
and squirrels.

Me? Iâ€™m not even
a good shot.

Isnâ€™t this a job for Butte?

Butte has a job
at Mr. Scatterâ€™s,
and meatâ€™s too expensive,

so here you go.

all I do is work around here.

Now I have to slay
little animals?

I donâ€™t even have enough time
to read anymore.


All right.

I can pan for gold.
I can do that.

Thatâ€™s a good idea.

All you have to do
is dig up about a ton
of dirt a day,

then squat kneeâ€deep
in iceâ€cold water

and sift through the dirt
till your arms are numb.


Donâ€™t forget this.

Pick some blueberries,
like your pa liked.

This ainâ€™t what I expected,
Bernard.

"...since the time
of Abraham downwards,

"there have been women
who have devoted
their thoughts to heaven,

"and their actions
to the works of kindness
of men,

"tending the sick,
feeding the hungry,
and relieving the distressed.

And among these
will I, Rebecca, be numbered."


At first I thought
it was a grizzly,

but when I got closer,
I saw that it was a person.

I think it was an Indian.
Iâ€™m sure he went off
to get the rest of his tribe.

We just canâ€™t
stay here anymore, Mama.

I know, I know.

We might be captured
and have to live on acorns
and crushed grasshoppers.

Well, we might.
You are all
imagination and no sense.

But, Mama, I really did...

"But, Mama" nothing.
Lord, you are
the spookiest child.

Whatâ€™s to become of you?

Every tub has to learn
how to stand
on its own bottom sometimes.

Now, as for you,
no meat, no supper.

Iâ€™ll starve.

Thatâ€™s the best reason
I know to find meat.


California Whipple!

CALIFORNIA: <i>Mamaâ€™s gotten
mean as a skunk.</i>

<i>This may be my last letter,
because sheâ€™s starving me
to death.</i>

Food for the mind
and food for the body.

Oh, thank you, Mr. Beale.

Iâ€™ll return them
as soon as I read them.

Oh, theyâ€™re just my law books.
You can keep â€™em.

California,
Iâ€™ll be leaving soon.

Can I go with you?

Besides, your mama needs you.

She doesnâ€™t need me at all,
except to do work.

You better take
a grownâ€up look, girl.

Your mama does need you,
and for a lot more than work.

You ought to be grateful
you can take care of her.

You donâ€™t know
what it feels like
when you canâ€™t.

Now, look, you eat that there
before I get in trouble
for stealing it.

Goodbye, California.

Bye.

CALIFORNIA: Iâ€™m sure
it was an Indian,

but he was very small and...

Maybe it was
a prehistoric man

and Iâ€™m the first
<i>Homo sapien</i> to see him.

Oh, God.
Butte, donâ€™t go to sleep.

What do you think?

He was an Indian.

They love to scalp
little girls.

The lantern attracts them.

Itâ€™s Godâ€™s truth.

[GUN FIRING]


MAN 1: What was that?
MAN 2: I was sleepinâ€™.

[ALL CHATTERING]

Carrots done gone
and shot himself
in the head.

SCATTER: Heâ€™s dead.

MAN: Bless us, O Lord.

No, no! No, no, no.
Itâ€™s best not to look.


Why would he do
something like that?

Didnâ€™t find no gold is why.
Wife and six kids in Ohio.

AMOS: Damn shame.

Well, why is gold
so important?

I hate this town.
I hate it, itâ€™s horrible.

Lucy...
At least he saw
the elephant.

Wait, let her go.
Why?

I need your help
preparinâ€™ the body.

Miners are too squeamish
to mess with stiffs.

You ever done it before?

My husband.

So did you actually see
the body and the blood?

He wasnâ€™t a barn rat, Butte.


You know, getting buried
in a box doesnâ€™t make you rot
any slower.

What do you suppose
Pa looks like now?

I mean, do you thinkâ€â€?

How could you think
of him like that?

Sometimes I think
of scary things
to practice for being brave.

Iâ€™m the only man
in the family
now that Paâ€™s dead.

Yeah, well,
youâ€™re not Pa, okay?

I think of him
as being sweet and kind,
not like you.


[â™ª]

[TWIG SNAPS]

Who are you?

Annie Flagg my name.
Itâ€™s mine.

Iâ€™m California Whipple.
I live in Lucky Diggins.

Were you the one watching me
in the meadow?

Whatâ€™s that red thing there?

A book.

<i>Ivanhoe.
</i> Have you ever read it?

Canâ€™t read.

You can come in
if you want.

You made this hut?

And you made all these things?

Oh, whatâ€™s that?

That a bone whistle.

You just blow
right there.

[WHISTLE BLOWING]



Here a slipâ€noose snare.

Catch go slow.
Gun no good.

You wanna catch â€™em,
Iâ€™ll show you where to look.


[WOLF GROWLING LOUDLY]

Huh.

Hungry.

Thereâ€™s no buckshot.

Now, how did you
manage that?

Well, itâ€™s better
without a shotgun, Mama.

A slip noose is best
for a goâ€slower...
A possum.

And a drop cage
for the prairie chickens.
You just use corn for bait.

Annie taught me, Mama.

She lives in this stick house
that she built all by herself
in the woods.

And she also taught me
how to speak to crows.

She calls them skyâ€scratch
because of their
scratchy voice.

[MIMICKING CROW]

And she has
this huge white wolf
that she feeds bones to,

Silver Dog.

Where do you come from?

You donâ€™t believe me?

Well, first it was Indians
and grizzlies
and now itâ€™s a forest child.

Would you please
live in this world
for a moment?

Mr. Scatter just told me
that my bread is as hard
as tree bark and not as tasty,

so Iâ€™d like you
to do the baking from now on.

[CALIFORNIA SIGHS]

So you need to go over
to a store
to see if the sugar is in.

[â™ª]

Morninâ€™.

Young lady!

Iâ€™m lookinâ€™ for the town
of Lucky Diggins.

Well, this is it.

For the love
of Uncle Peterâ€™s dirty socks,
this is it?

This is all there is.

Hoo! My goodness.

Oh, top of the morninâ€™
to you, maâ€™am,

and I canâ€™t remember
the last time Iâ€™ve seen such
a fine top of the morninâ€™.

My name is Brother Claymore.

I am the sole founder
and minister

of the Free and Independent
Church of the Outdoors.

Come here to save souls.

And I was wonderinâ€™
if thereâ€™s about here

a family that might
show the charity to possibly
put me up for a spell.

May I be able to depend
on your charity?
You are Sister...

I am Sister nobody,
Mr. Claymore.

I am Arvella Whipple,
and I have little affection
for men of the cloth.

My charity costs
$18.20 a week.

Mama!


[MULE BRAYING]

Iâ€™m afraid that we donâ€™t have
that sum, maâ€™am.

Well, then, the ground
will have to serve you, sir.

Mama, why were you so rude
to that man?

I have no use
for religious men.

They leave a bad taste
in my mouth,
like old mushrooms.

Our pastor back home
knew our family for 50 years,

but when your father died,
because he wasnâ€™t
a churchgoing man,

he refused to bury him.

So thank you just the same.

Now, big old Brother Claymore,
I mean, no one cares a lick
about his sermonizinâ€™.

Weâ€™re up there workinâ€™,
he gets up on the rocks

and starts preachinâ€™
to the air.

He sounds like a damn foghorn.

I told him heâ€™d do
a lot better if he worked
as hard at mininâ€™.

Clyde, he laughed.
He said,
"I am mininâ€™, brother.

ALL: "Mininâ€™ for souls."

[ALL LAUGHING]
McPHEE: I listen to him.

It wouldnâ€™t hurt
if some of the rest of you
did too.

Plenty of sinners
at this table.

Damn Bible whacker!
MAN: McPhee!

Sit down
and put that knife away
right now.

I will not tolerate fighting
in this establishment.

Here is the balance
of your bed and board.

Now take it and get out
and donâ€™t come back.


Miners donâ€™t have souls
worth saving.

Well, listen to her, will you?
I was gonna propose.

I was gonna make you
Mrs. Amos Frogge
one of these years,

but I donâ€™t know now.

California Frogge. Hmm.
Might be a problem.

People might think
youâ€™re gonna hop, croak
and eat bugs.

[ALL LAUGHING]

AMOS: I can see her now,
jumpinâ€™. The toad girl.

Eatinâ€™ bugs.
Thatâ€™s a sight. Eatinâ€™ bugs.

Why didnâ€™t you
stand up for me?

I wasnâ€™t the one who told them
they had no souls.

Why do you listen
to those miners, anyway?

Truth is,
you need thicker skin,
California Whipple.

My sister, the swamp frog.

Shut up.

The truth is, you like
having them laugh at me.

At least Pa loved me.
You donâ€™t even like me.

[FIDDLE PLAYING ROMANTIC TUNE]

[ALL CHATTERING]

AMOS: You make this pie,
honeydew?

Yeah.
I changed my mind.

I will marry you
when you grow up.

Mmm! Scrum delicious!

There are gravel monkeys
up in them canyons

livinâ€™ on hog fat
and acorn flour biscuits,

give an ounce of gold
for one of your pies.

ALL: Yeah!

[ALL CLAMORING]

CLYDE: God gives it,
and he gives it to you free.

All that he asks back
is that you love him.

Youâ€™re lookinâ€™
in the wrong place, gentlemen.

The gold you seek
is in your own souls.

[CLYDE CONTINUES PREACHING]
Hi! Fresh pies!

Want a pie?
Iâ€™ll take one.

One dollar.

One dollar?
Uhâ€huh.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Pies! Fruit pies!
You want a pie?

Want a pie?

Pie?

You want a pie?
Nah.

Pies! Fresh pies!

Go on and get out of here.

Go along.

Hey!

He said, "You wanna hide God
from man?

"You really wanna hide him?
You hide God inside man,

"â€™cause heâ€™ll never think
to look there."

Iâ€™m sorry
my mama was rude before.

Oh, thatâ€™s all right.

Do ministers speak for God?

No. No man can speak
for God.

But I do know
sometimes God speaks
through men.

You see, I gave God
the reins to my burrow
a long time ago.

I just let him do the drivinâ€™,
because every time I drive it,

somehow or another
I manage to run it
right into the crick.

But I do know that God
will show you the path.

And whether or not
you choose it,
now, thatâ€™ll be up to you.

What I need is a new name.

Rebecca?

No.

Louisa?

Nah, too girlish.

Desdemona?

Ugh.

Lucy?

No. But itâ€™s short.

Lucy. Lucy Whipple.

Iâ€™m very pleased to meet you.
My name is Lucy Whipple.

From this day forward,
I will be known to the world
as Lucy Whipple.

Lucy. I like that.

I know 48 words for liquor.

Hooch, cactus juice,
catgut, cougarâ€™s milk,

gator sweat, jackâ€aâ€dandy,
gullet wash, panther piss,
cough and varnish...

Now, why call liquor
cough and varnish?

Youâ€™re so dumb, California.

Do you know whatâ€™s dumber,
is memorizing stupid words
for liquor.

And Iâ€™m not
California anymore.
You can call me Lucy.

What?
I changed my name.

To Lucy?
It sounds like some showoff
from the city.

Ugh and puke.

Shut up, Butte.
You know, Prairie liked it.

Just donâ€™t tell Mama.

Then why did you change
your name?

You wouldnâ€™t understand.


Lâ€Uâ€C...

Y.

Good.
Now, what does that spell?

"Lukey."

Close. Itâ€™s Lucy.
Iâ€™ve changed my name.
Iâ€™m Lucy now.

Go to California
and be called California!

Lucy.

L, Y.

Is your pa a miner?

No, miners are bad people.

Well, they do swear
and smell.

And they kill all the Indians.

A...
Where does
the rest of your family live?

Not supposed to tell.

[MAN WHISTLING]

Oh, thatâ€™s Joe.

Morninâ€™ to you, Miss...

Joe, this is Lucy.

Uh, I didnâ€™t know
you had company.

Itâ€™s all right.

Pleased to meet you,
Miss Lucy.

I just done come by
to visit Miss Annie here.

Iâ€™ve never met
an actual Negro before.

Iâ€™ve read about them
in <i>Robinson Crusoe,</i> but...

Iâ€™ve never seen you in town.

Do you live...
Do you live off the land,
like Annie?

Uh, I donâ€™t have
as fine a house as Miss Annie
done built herself here,

but I manage,
sleepinâ€™ under the stars.

Well, you should stay
in our boarding tent.

I mean, my mamaâ€™s
not a very good cook,
but thereâ€™s a lot of food.

No, Missus, I...
I just donâ€™t want to cause
that kind of trouble.

Do you want a chokeberry pie?

Itâ€™s only a dollar.

Did your ma cook it?

I did.

In that case,
itâ€™s gold well spent.

I love chokeberry pie.

Thank you.

So you donâ€™t think
I made up Joe?

No. Jimmy Whiskers
knows him too.

What kind of trouble
do you think
he was talking about, Mama?

Well, some white folk think
that colored folk arenâ€™t fit
to live with white people.

Well, he shouldnâ€™t
have to stay in the woods
all winter.

Why doesnâ€™t he stay with us?

Well, thatâ€™s not a good idea,
California.

Though he could live
in our mule shed

and I could make him
breakfast and supper
for $10 a week,

if heâ€™ll eat it outside.

Thatâ€™s the best I could do.
The mule shed?

Mama, do you think
heâ€™s not fit to live
with other white people?

Donâ€™t preach to me,
California.

Take it or leave it.

Fine.

Iâ€™ve changed my name to Lucy,
by the way.

Take it or leave it.

Come back here.

What do you mean,
youâ€™ve changed your name?

California is a place,
not a person.

What kind of mother
would name her daughter
after a godforsaken state?

It just proves
that you hate me.

Donâ€™t you ever say that again.

If you werenâ€™t so selfish
and stubborn, I would tell you
how I feel about you.

Until then, donâ€™t make
such outlandish assumptions.

My masterâ€™s name
was Mr. Sawyer.

He took to drinkinâ€™
by night

and beatinâ€™ me
by day.

So one night when Master Sawyer
was drunk,

I let off.
I took a horse.

Miss Lucy, I know that done
right make me a thief,

but out here,
I ainâ€™t no slave.

Iâ€™s free.

Iâ€™d just as soon live outside
as in. Thanks for savinâ€™ me.

Whatâ€™s your last name,
Joe?

Donâ€™t know.

Master called
all his slaves "Joe."

Easy to remember.

Well, everyone should have
their own name,

especially one you like.

Iâ€™m an expert
on name changing.

Donâ€™t bother.
Itâ€™s okay.

I have the perfect name
for you.

Bernard.

It was my fatherâ€™s name.

He had big hands like you
and he was sweet like you also.

Bernard?

I like it.

Itâ€™s a mighty fine name,
Miss Lucy.

Iâ€™ll be proud
to carry it.

Well, Iâ€™m very pleased
to meet you, Mr. Bernard.

Pleased to meet you too,
Miss Lucy.

Cut it like this.

[WHISTLE BLOWING]

See?

[WHISTLE BLOWING]

Your friend Annie teach you
how to make that?

So you believe me now?

Scatter says
her ma and pa live
up on Bottle Creek.

She has some brothers too.

Well, how come
they donâ€™t come into town?

I donâ€™t know.

But I donâ€™t want you
going up there, ever.

Well, why not?

You can visit with Annie
in the woods,

and sheâ€™s welcome
to come here,
but donâ€™t go there.

But you have to have
some kind of reason.

The reason is,
I said donâ€™t go there.

Now go find something
useful to do, goose.
Playâ€™s over.

[LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING]

[PEOPLE CHEERING]

What are they celebrating?

The gents struck it rich.

Gold is awful.

We should have stayed
in Buttonfields.

Pa said it was
a little piece of heaven.

Well, it wasnâ€™t.

Your pa kept you away
from anything unpleasant.

ARVELLA: He really didnâ€™t have
much use for the real world.

Well, why would he think
California would be better?

Why donâ€™t we just
get some sleep?

Good night, Mama.

Why donâ€™t you
ever talk to me, Mama?

If I talked to you
every time you wanted to talk,

nothing would ever get done.
Night, Mama.

Well, weâ€™re not
doing anything now.
We canâ€™t even sleep.

Itâ€™s just not the time, Lucy.

You called me Lucy.

I would like to welcome
Mr. Claymore to our table.

Well, thatâ€™s kind
of you, Mrs. Whipple.
Thank you.

AMOS: Uh, Clyde,
what is this religion
youâ€™re preachinâ€™?

What are the rules?

Amos, Iâ€™m not big on rules.
I preach free will.

Although I have to tell you,
I havenâ€™t had much success
as a preacher.

Iâ€™ve had no converts.
I have no followers.

But I do know that thereâ€™s
gonna be wagon trains
headinâ€™ back east

full of people who feel that
God does not wanna know them

because they have not acquired
the riches expected of them.

And I think someone
should go along to remind them
that God is with them,

always has been with them,
and always will be with them.

So Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™
of goinâ€™ along.

Brother Claymore,
would you refuse
to bury someone

because he wasnâ€™t
a churchgoing man?

Absolutely not.
I say the man doesnâ€™t
need church to know God,

and I canâ€™t see
how not buryinâ€™ a man
would help him, help me,

or especially help God.

AMOS:
Thatâ€™s a real good point,
Reverend.

No, Lucy, I will not allow you
to trek 3000 miles back east
with Mr. Claymore.

One good answer
does not make a good man.

And one bad pastor
doesnâ€™t make them all bad,
either.

Well, listen to you.

Youâ€™re getting mighty good
at standing up to me lately.


Someone else
can do the baking.

I donâ€™t need a baker, Lucy.
I can do that myself.

What I need is
to find some way

to pull myself up
out of the void left
by the death of your father.

So please help me.

LUCY:
<i>Dear Gram and Grampop,</i>

<i>please plant bluebells
on Papaâ€™s grave
next time you visit.</i>

<i>They finally built us
a new boardinghouse,</i>

<i>but we still live in a tent
so small you couldnâ€™t
swing a cat by its tail.</i>

Got it!

[ALL CHEERING]

[LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING]

AMOS:
Man, how â€™bout a dance?

SNOOSE:
As long as I can lead.

If you are not
a vision of beauty,
Mrs. Whipple.

Well, I wish you wouldnâ€™t
exaggerate, Mr. Claymore,
but thank you kindly.

I just hope
weâ€™re gonna have enough pies
for everyone.

It is rude to stare,
Mr. Claymore.

These are for you, Mama.

Papa used to get bluebells,
but they donâ€™t grow
around here.

May I have this dance?

You most certainly may.

Iâ€™ll guard those for you.

Thank you.

MAN: Here we go!

We talked about this, Annie.
Iâ€™m gonna be at your side
every minute.

And thereâ€™s gonna be food
and dancing and storytelling.

Bernard, tell her.

Iâ€™s ainâ€™t so sure I should
go in on my own self,
Miss Lucy.


You both are going.

Letâ€™s go, Bernard.
Come on.

Hello. Iâ€™m Lucy Whipple.
This is Annie Flagg
and Bernard Freeman.

Mrs. Whipple, I donâ€™t know
why your daughter
brought those two in here,

but they canâ€™t stay.

Really?
Well, I admire her for it,

having the courage
to befriend outcasts.

Thatâ€™s what Jesus did so well,
isnâ€™t that so, Mr. Claymore?

That is the gospel truth.

And should we do any less,
Mr. Scatter?

Come with me, please.

Mrs. Whipple...

Lucy, Mr. Scatter
has something to say
to your friends.

I just...
Just that I, um...

I, uh...
Welcome to our party.

Thatâ€™s all.
Welcome aboard.

Annie, Bernard,
this is my mama.

Welcome. Welcome.

Thank you kindly.

This here is the ballad
of Rattlesnake Jake,

a man with a devilâ€™s grin.

Heâ€™d pick his teeth
with a bowie knife,

and heâ€™d rob, and heâ€™d shoot,
and heâ€™d kill.

Then Sheriff Ben Bueller,
he came to town
with a star of shiny tin.

And he said, "I swear
upon my motherâ€™s grave

"Iâ€™m gonna bring
that bastard in."

Now, Sheriff Ben Bueller,
he drew first,

but a gunfighter he was not.

But Jake was ready,
he was cool as ice,

and he dropped him
with just one shot.

Now, the bullet went
through the Sheriffâ€™s skull
like piercinâ€™ an empty can,

bounced off a bedpost
made of iron
and off a minerâ€™s pickinâ€™ pan.

And out through the window
that bullet flew,

like a projectile
surely beguiled,

and it pierced the heart
of a grizzly bear

about to devour a child.

Now, when the posse
caught up to Jake,

he actually shed a tear.

[IN HUSKY VOICE] Said,
"Iâ€™m sorry that Sheriff,
he got in the way.

"I was just aiminâ€™
at a hungry bear."

Thunderation,
that manâ€™s a vicious liar!

Oh, shush, shush.
If I catch up with him...

So Jake went free
to rob and kill and maim

with no remorse.

And he picked his teeth
with his bowie knife

as he rode off on his horse.

So if, in your camp,
you should spy a man
whose smile is fake,

lock up your gold,
your wife and your dog,

â€™cause it might be
Rattlesnake Jake.

Damnation!
Amos, you got us all riled up.

Mr. Scatter,
can you open the bar?

The saloon is open!

[ALL CHEERING]

AMOS: Quite a little tale,
right, Brother?

Itâ€™s a fine story.
Thank you.

Thatâ€™s a fine, fine story.
Thank you.

That was terrifying.

Truth makes
the most powerful story.

CLYDE: But you tell it good.

Might you mind joininâ€™ me
in a celebratory potation?

I thank you kindly,
Mr. Claymore,
but I donâ€™t drink.

Well, actually, neither do I.


Good night, Mrs. Whipple.

Arvella.

Excuse me?

My Christian name is Arvella.

Well, good night, Arvella.

Good night.

Itâ€™s Buck McPhee.
It has to be.

No one is his friend,

and he doesnâ€™t let anyone
in his tent.

And he has
that huge bowie knife.

He has to be Rattlesnake Jake.

But I thought
it was only a tall tale.

But Buck is different.

He has snake eyes
and he doesnâ€™t drink
or swear like everyone else.

Why?

But Jake could
do those things, California.

Lucy.

But not if heâ€™s trying
to conceal his identity.

And if he were
Rattlesnake Jake,

Iâ€™m sure
thereâ€™s some kind of reward
for his capture.

And if I got that reward,
Iâ€™d have enough money
to go back home.

[HORSE NEIGHING]

There he is.

He comes this far
every Sunday.

Are you sure he be Jake?

"Is," not "be."
He is Jake.

Maybe this is where
he buries his victims.

There he is.

See that bag on the side
of his saddle?

Thereâ€™s probably
a head in there.

Come on.
Letâ€™s get down there.

I believe heâ€™s takinâ€™
a bath, Lucy.

I suppose
even Rattlesnake Jake
takes a bath.

Donâ€™t look.

Why? We can look.

Donâ€™t matter.

I believe heâ€™s a she.

Oh, come on!

LUCY:
<i>Dear Gram and Grampop,</i>

<i>Lucky Diggins
is a very strange place.</i>

<i>Nothing is ever
what it seems, ever.</i>

<i>Butteâ€™s caught the gold bug.</i>

<i>He quit his job at
Scatterâ€™s Store and is panning
</i> <i>at Cyclone Creek.</i>

<i>Heâ€™s crazy.
All miners are crazy.</i>

<i>Iâ€™ve started a lending library
at 5 cents a book.</i>

<i>Whatâ€™s so surprising
is that miners want books.</i>

<i>I miss Gramâ€™s
Indian pudding with cream</i>

<i>and Grampopâ€™s laugh
like a locomotive starting up.</i>

<i>I wish I could come home
to live with you both.</i>

<i>Your granddaughter, Lucy.</i>

<i>P. S. Iâ€™ve changed my name
to Lucy.</i>

<i>California is dead.</i>

[BUTTE EXCLAIMING]

Whatâ€™s wrong, Mama?

You stay here.

What the...?

Thereâ€™s somebody
in the water!

The boyâ€™s in the water.

Get him, Amos.
I canâ€™t swim.

I canâ€™t either.
Somebodyâ€™s in the water!

Boy in the water!
Boy in the water!

Rusty, get him
from your side!

Get him!
Boy in the water!

We gotta help him.

I got you. Hold on.

Iâ€™ll get to you, Clyde!

Clyde, grab this!

Hold on! Hold on!

AMOS: Got you!

Boys, boys, pull him out.

Take my hand.
Pull him out.

Give me the boy.

Donâ€™t you let that life
out of you, son.

CLYDE: Donâ€™t give up, son.
Donâ€™t give up.

Here comes his ma.

Hold on, son!

CLYDE: Son.

Donâ€™t die, boy.

You hold on
to that life, boy.

Boy, donâ€™t die. Stay with me.

Donâ€™t you let that life
out of you, son.

Come back here, boy.

[ARVELLA CRYING]
Hold on.

Stay with me, son.
Stay with me, boy.




ARVELLA: Is he all right?
Is he all right?

Thank you, Mr. Claymore.

You better thank God,
Mrs. Whipple,
â€™cause I canâ€™t swim.


LUCY: <i>Dear Gram and Grampop,</i>

<i>Mr. Scatter says
Butte swallowed water</i>

<i>thatâ€™s been poisoned
by mining.</i>

<i>But Iâ€™ve seen raccoons
drinking from it
every morning,</i>

<i>and theyâ€™re fine.</i>

Take another. Take another.


Good boy.

Okay.


Good boy. Shh.


Arenâ€™t there any doctors
close by?

Thereâ€™s no work for â€™em.

A miner would rather die
than give a doctor his gold.

Maybe Sacramento,
but thatâ€™s four days
by riverboat.

Itâ€™d be a whole lot faster
by horse.

I got a good horse.

Iâ€™ll go, Lucy.

Amos got it wrong.

The bullet stuck
right in the Sheriffâ€™s hat.

It was hard as a rock.

Murder, it was.


[IN WOMANâ€™S VOICE]
Just kiddinâ€™, Lucy.

Listen,

donâ€™t tell anyone
my secret, okay?

I like gold,

but I donâ€™t trust miners
with women.

Hyah!

Watch it!

Dag diddy.


Dag diddy!

Buck went for the doctor?

Buck is not
Rattlesnake Jake, Butte.
I told you that.

The good news
is sheâ€™ll be back
in two days.

The doctorâ€™s a woman?

No, um, Buckâ€™s horse is.
Sheâ€™s a mare.

If I die, you wonâ€™t have
a man in the family.

We donâ€™t have one now, Butte.

But, if by some impossible,

oneâ€inâ€aâ€billion chance
something happens to you,

me and Mama can take care
of the family just fine.

I guess you could.

You have a lot of guts
after all, Lucy.

I remembered some more.

Bug juice, chain lightning

and sheep wash.

[â™ª]

If Butte dies,

Iâ€™ll never talk again.

My sister, she died.

She was 6.

What happened to her?

I talk to her a lot
and she talks back,
so I donâ€™t miss her.

But you canâ€™t talk
to a dead person, Annie.

You know words
and writinâ€™,

but some things
you donâ€™t know.

I was...
I was blowing my whistle
in my dream.

Do you think Iâ€™ll have it
where Iâ€™m going, Mama?

I wish I got to be a man.

I saw the elephant,
didnâ€™t I?

I feel
like all the kickâ€™s
drifting out of me.


Like steam
rising from wet shoes.


Phlegm cutter

is the 49th word
for liquor.

[EXHALING HEAVILY]


[ARVELLA SOBBING]


Iâ€™ll prepare his body.

I got the doctor.

Itâ€™s too late.

Please, letâ€™s not
dishonor Butte Whipple
by mourninâ€™ his passing.

But letâ€™s rather
celebrate his presence

and the fact that
God honored us with him.

All thatâ€™s happened here now
is that Godâ€™s called him home.


Heavenâ€™s brew.
Thatâ€™s the 50th.

[â™ª]

He was looking for gold
so I wouldnâ€™t have to work
so hard.

Sure is a noble gesture,
isnâ€™t it?

Noble for anyone,
let alone a 10â€yearâ€old.

Made nobler by the fact
that you never asked him
to do it.


Itâ€™s all right.

Itâ€™s all right.

She hasnâ€™t talked
or hardly eaten in days.
I just...

Youâ€™re gettinâ€™
the boarders fed.

I donâ€™t know what to do.

This is what you can do.

Sheâ€™ll come back
when sheâ€™s ready.

Here, Mama,
I made this for you to try.

Here.
No, thank you.

Arvella,

you can sit out here
until the cows come home,

but thatâ€™s not gonna
bring your Butte back.

You know,
you have to let him live
in your heart.

â€™Cause heâ€™s no further
than your heart.

But you have to start tendinâ€™
to your daughter,

or else I know that
youâ€™ll surely lose her.

Well, maybe
not in body,

but in soul, and thatâ€™s
much more important.


Iâ€™m sorry, Lucy.

Iâ€™m so sorry.

I did wrong
to drag you children
to this wild place.

Mama, donâ€™t.

I keep thinking that Butte
would still be alive

if I hadnâ€™t insisted that...

Itâ€™s not your fault.

People die everywhere.

Pa died in Massachusetts.

Itâ€™s not your fault, Mama.

You and I are so different.

Me always looking ahead,

you always looking behind
at what you loved and lost.

I just wanted us to be safe.

Thereâ€™s no place thatâ€™s safe.

Just Godâ€™s abiding love
and our own two feet.

We have to trust in both.

Butte trusted, and heâ€™s dead.

And when you see God,
you can ask him why.

Butteâ€™s paying us a visit.

Yeah.

LUCY: <i>Dear Gram and Grampop,</i>

<i>Butte is dead.</i>

<i>And now that heâ€™s gone,
I realize how much
I truly loved him.</i>

<i>He was my friend,
and now I need a friend
more than ever.</i>

Annie? Annie!


What happened to you?

LINUS: Who is it?
Go away, Lucy.

LINUS: Whoâ€™s out there?

Well, well!
Is this your friend, Annie?

Introduce me properâ€like.

Lucy, this is my pa.
Pa, this is Lucy.

LINUS: What you got there?
Pie.

LINUS: Is that a fruit pie?

Well, now, ainâ€™t that nice?

Well, come on in.

We got some sweet water
would go good with it.
Mmâ€mm.

Well, let me see.

We got some plates.

Go over and get some cups,
Annie.

Oh!

Oh, I just thought...

Annie, your mother
and brothers

are up there on the ridge
pickinâ€™ some berries.

Why donâ€™t you run up there
and fetch â€™em?

We can all have some pie.

Go on and get â€™em.

Young lady,
wonâ€™t you please have a seat?

I was a bigâ€game hunter
in California

before there was
hardly a soul here.

Everybody used to come
to my door.

You should have seen it then.
Bountiful.

All gone now.

My eye got took out
by a grizzly.

I did all right trappinâ€™
for a while,

till the damn gold miners
scared all the small game
away.

Your pa,

he a miner, girl?

No, heâ€™s dead.

Oh.

Well, thatâ€™s too bad.
Girl needs to have a pa.

Yeah.

Well, you sure are
a purty little thing.

Your skin is so nice
and smooth,

and your hair is so purty.

Where you goinâ€™, girl?



[LINUS SCREAMS]

Lucy! Lucy!
Go on, get out of here.

BERNARD: Get out! Run!



Good Lord, what have I done?

You canâ€™t tell no one
about this, Lucy.

Paâ€™ll kill you
if he hear you do.
I know him.

Annie!

Did your pa
kill your sister, Annie?

You canâ€™t stay here.
You gotta come home with me.

No, heâ€™d find me.
Iâ€™ll stay in the woods.
I know places he donâ€™t.

In a few days, heâ€™ll forget.


He...

He hits Mama.

She donâ€™t hardly talk
no more.

Will you come see me?

Youâ€™ll come?

Iâ€™ll come. Iâ€™ll come.

This is the best I could do,
Bernard.

Mr. Flagg would never think
to look for you here,

and I know
how to shoot a shotgun
if he does.

Itâ€™s just fine, Miss Lucy.

I just ainâ€™t never had
no one lookinâ€™ out
for me before, thatâ€™s all.

Well, Iâ€™ve never had anyone
save my life before.

Bernard has decided
to stay in the shed
in case of forest fires.

Yes, I would say
that you are workinâ€™
much too hard.

Would you let me please
just help you chop
a little bit of this?

Well, thatâ€™s very kind
of you, Mr. Claymore.

Clyde.

Clyde.

Thank you,
but I canâ€™t pay you.

You know, I donâ€™t offer
out of any charity

or for the hope of
any sort of future employment.

And can you not just accept
and swallow the fact
that I wanna help you,

plain and simple? Damn!

You made me swear.

Anything else?

No.

No.


All right, step back.

I wouldnâ€™t hold the bottom
of the ax.

Thatâ€™s rather dangerous.
Oh, no, please, watch this.


Itâ€™s a wonderful shot.

Whatâ€™s goinâ€™ on?
Someoneâ€™s been shot.

Heâ€™s got a bullet hole
in the back of his head.
Haul him out of there.

Who is he, Jonas?

Linus Flagg.
Somebody murdered him.

Annie?

Your pa is dead.
Somebody shot him.

He a varmint.

AMOS: Jonas,
the Sheriffâ€™s cominâ€™.

SCATTER: Deputy Scraggs.

They told me you found him
in the crick?

SCATTER: Yep.

I guess heâ€™s a miner.

Nope, he was a trapper.

Huh.

Anybody see anything
or hear anything?

I guess maybe a woodpecker
could have done it.

If you ask me,
it was that nigger, Bernard.
He done it.

Bernard wouldnâ€™t
harm anyone
and you know that, Snoose.

SCRAGGS: Iâ€™ll decide
who done the killinâ€™.

This fella got a family?

They got a little place
up on Bottle Creek.

SCRAGGS: You show me
where thatâ€™s at?

Some of you gents ought
to bury this noâ€neck stiff
before he draws flies.

Itâ€™s gonna get hot.

You donâ€™t want to see this.

Arenâ€™t you coming?

I may be needed
as a character witness.

Sheâ€™s been reading
those law books.

AMOS: Looks like the Sheriff
arrested Flaggâ€™s wife.

JIMMY: Did they bring
their young â€™uns?

Annie! Annie?

Annie, if you donâ€™t come
to the trial,
theyâ€™re gonna hang your mama.

Annie!

All right,
take your seats, please.
Take your seats, please.

I call this court to order.

Now, in the absence of a judge
and a prosecutor

and a defense lawyer,

I, Deputy Sheriff
Ambrose Scraggs,

Iâ€™ll serve as all three
of them myself.

Mrs. Flagg here
will be the first witness.

Mr. Claymore, will you
swear her in, please, sir?

You donâ€™t, uh...
You donâ€™t tell lies, do you?

You swear to God?

Mrs. Flagg,
did you murder your husband?

Sheâ€™s guilty.
[ALL AGREEING]

Yeah, string her up!
Get rid of her!

SCRAGGS: Sit down and shut up,
all of you.

Iâ€™ll decide whoâ€™s guilty.

Whyâ€™d you shoot him,
Mrs. Flagg?
Was he doinâ€™ somethinâ€™ to you?

Was he doinâ€™ somethinâ€™
that provoked you
to killinâ€™ him?

He was beatinâ€™ on Ma
with a sycamore stick,

because theyâ€™re real hard
and they donâ€™t break easy.

Everybody knows Linus
was a mean son of a bitch.

You donâ€™t talk in this court
unless youâ€™re a witness.

SCRAGGS: It ainâ€™t evidence.
Itâ€™s hearsay.

Mrs. Flagg, take your seat.
And if thereâ€™s
no more witnesses...

I would like Mrs. Flagg
to demonstrate
her marksmanship, Your Honor.


Iâ€™m Miss Lucy Whipple,

and I would like
to defend Mrs. Flagg.

[CROWD CHATTERING]

You would, would you?

How old are you, daughter?

I was 14 on Sunday,
but no one remembered.

Now, Mrs. Flagg
has the right to a lawyer,

according to the laws
of California,

which became a state
September 9th.

I deeply volunteer.

Youâ€™re just a little olâ€™ girl.

Whatever would make you think
you could defend
a fullâ€grown woman

whoâ€™s, by the way,
already confessed
to the killinâ€™?

Thereâ€™s no age limit
in the law, Your Honor.

And Iâ€™ve read law books,
so Iâ€™m not entirely
uninformed.

All right. All right.
Go to it.

Letâ€™s hear
what you got to say.

Lucy, what are you doing?

Mama, you said
every tub needs to stand
on its own bottom sometime.

Well, Iâ€™m standing.

Now, Your Honor,
if Mrs. Flagg shot Mr. Flagg,

then we need to demonstrate
how well she can shoot.

How are you gonna do that?

Uh, Mr. Scatter, can you
get me the rifle, please?

SCRAGGS:
But you be damn careful, lady.
Youâ€™ve already killed one man.

There ainâ€™t no need
of killinâ€™ any more.

Now, Mrs. Flagg,
do you think you can shoot
this mug right there?

[GUN COCKING]

[PEOPLE EXCLAIMING]

SNOOSE:
Damn, weâ€™re losinâ€™ beer.
Plug it up.

AMOS: I got it, I got it.

As you can see, Your Honor,
sheâ€™s very badly nearsighted.

So how could she
have shot her husband?

That was pretty clever.
Pretty dang clever.

But it donâ€™t prove nothinâ€™.

She could have missed that mug
on purpose.

I donâ€™t care if sheâ€™s blind
as a bat, dearie.

She could have snuck up
behind her husband anytime
and just blasted away.

No, I think she shot him
pointâ€blank from the front

when he came after her
with a sycamore stick.

And Iâ€™ve seen that
same evidence of that stick
on his daughter, Annie.

Not evidence. Thatâ€™s hearsay.

Well, he inflicted these
on me, Your Honor,

and that is not hearsay.

Damn.

SCRAGGS: Iâ€™m sorry.

But the fact remains,
you canâ€™t be a defense lawyer

and a witness
in the same trial.

Now, the jury will just
disregard what you saw
and what she had to say.

Tell me this, Miss Whipple.

You say
Mrs. Flagg shot her husband
pointâ€blank from the front.

How come the bullet was able
to get around the back

and blow the back
of his neck off?

Have you got an answer
for that, dearie?

It ricocheted off the pots
and pans, Your Honor.

SCRAGGS:
They found him in the crick.

There ainâ€™t no pots and pans
in the crick to ricochet
no bullets off of.

But itâ€™s clear as cold water,
Your Honor,

that he was dragged
into that creek
after he was shot.

Now, as to the pots
and pans,

I will refer
to the extraordinary case

of Rattlesnake Jake,
a true murderer.

Now, when Jake
shot the Sheriff,

the bullet bounced
off the brass bar rail
and whizzed through the night,

where it hit a grizzly
about to devour a child.

Now, Jake lied and said
he was aiming for the grizzly
and not the Sheriff.

But Mrs. Flagg,
she aimed right for Mr. Flagg
in selfâ€defense.

And missed.

And the bullet ricocheted
off the pots and pans,
zinged around the room,

and hit Mr. Flagg
in the back of the neck.

And just like that,
he was dead
as a can of corned beef.

[PEOPLE LAUGHING]

Thatâ€™s poppycock.
I never heard nothinâ€™
like that in all of my life.

I gave you the right
to defend this wretched woman,

not to make a mockery
out of this court
and her justice.

Now, dearie,
you get over there
and you sit down and hush.

The woman freely confessed
to murder.

I donâ€™t give a hang
if sheâ€™s as blind as a bat.

I say she snuck up
behind her husband

and killed him in cold blood
like a lowâ€down coward.

Sheâ€™s gonna hang by the neck
till sheâ€™s dead.

[ALL MURMURING]

What is it now?

A verdict of murder
may be rendered

only if there is unanimous
agreement among the jurors,

who have examined the evidence

and concluded
beyond a reasonable doubt

that the defendant is guilty.

Your Honor,
the Statutes of California.

Now,
thereâ€™s not enough evidence
to prove that she killed him

or she didnâ€™t kill him.

So there is reasonable doubt.

And thatâ€™s all
Iâ€™m trying to say.

All right.

Everybody in the jury
thatâ€™s for conviction,
raise up your hands.

The juryâ€™s hung
higher than a dead pig
at Christmastime.

[PEOPLE LAUGHING]

Sheâ€™s free, Annie.

Yeah!

Mrs. Flagg, you can go home.

Mr. Scatter,
can we open this bar?

[ALL CHEERING]

Well done, dearie.

Thank you.

Hey.

Your pa
had the devil in him,

and what happened
was Godâ€™s justice,

you hear me?

Iâ€™m grateful
for all your doings, Lucy,
but it ainâ€™t right.

It is so.

Your pa would have
killed you, your ma
and your brothers.

Annie, you had to shoot him.

You knew I shot him?

And you donâ€™t feel guilty
before God about lyinâ€™?

I ainâ€™t lyinâ€™.

I just said
I couldnâ€™t prove the truth.

I mean, you took one life
to save another.

What happened
with Mr. Flagg?

Well, he didnâ€™t have time
to do much.

Annie fetched Bernard
and then he laid him out
like a side of beef.

Why didnâ€™t you tell me?

Because you have
a big temper, Mama,

and you would have
blown his head off

and then you would have
gone to jail for 150 years,
thatâ€™s why.

Thatâ€™s probably true.

Itâ€™s also true

that Mrs. Flagg
would be hanging
from a tree right now

if it wasnâ€™t for you.

Reading books
did some real good.

So from now on,

I think you should take
two hours every day
for reading.

Thank you, Mama.

That doesnâ€™t mean three hours
or that you donâ€™t
do your chores.

Iâ€™m sorry for forgetting
your birthday, Lucy.

Iâ€™m proud of you.

I am indeed.


I smell smoke.

Do you smell it?

Fire!
Fire!

Fire!

BOTH: Fire!

[ALL SHOUTING]

Get a bucket for me!
Get a bucket for me!

Get going!

Take this. Take it.

SCATTER:
To the right, to the right!
Go! Go to the main tank!

These buckets are empty!

AMOS: We need more water!

MAN: Faster!

The store! The store!

SCATTER: To the store!

AMOS: All of you!

Give me a bucket.

AMOS: Itâ€™s gettinâ€™
the boardinghouse!

ARVELLA: Go and get Prairie.

Be careful.

Prairie, get up.

Quickly, quickly. Prairie!

Take her.
Yeah, I got her.

All right, come on,
we gotta go.

Lucy.
ARVELLA: Come on.

We need the buckets
goddamn faster. Faster!

Here, take the baby.

You be careful.
You be careful.

Iâ€™m on fire! Hey!

Youâ€™re all right.
Youâ€™re all right.

Oh, jeez!

MAN: The trees!
Head for the trees!

Sad morninâ€™.

This townâ€™s gone.

God took it.

Yeah, itâ€™s finished,
sure enough. Wiped out.

We ainâ€™t had nothinâ€™
but bad luck
since you came into town.

It started near your shed.

Iâ€™m startinâ€™ to think
youâ€™re like a Jonas,

bringinâ€™ hard times.

It wasnâ€™t Bernard.
I kicked over a lantern.

An accident,
pure and simple,

and Iâ€™m awful sorry.

Oh, so, what?

This town wasnâ€™t nothinâ€™
to begin with.

Ashes to ashes.

"Ashes to ashes"!

So the town burned down.
Does that mean
weâ€™re supposed to give up?

Well, I donâ€™t give up.
Not me.

You try, you fail,
you try again.

I set up home here,
and Iâ€™m stayinâ€™ here.

You folks can do
whatever the hell you want.

Iâ€™ll stay too.

MAN: I got no place else
to go.

ARVELLA: Seems like
Butteâ€™s really gone.

We donâ€™t have
a shirt or a shoe
to remember him by.

Well, maybe itâ€™s time
we go back to Massachusetts,
Mama.

Mama, I found Butteâ€™s whistle.

[WHISTLE BLOWING]

Good girl.

LUCY: <i>Lucky Diggins is gone,</i>

<i>burned to ashes in 33 minutes.</i>

<i>A lot of the miners
are leaving.</i>

<i>The only good thing
</i> <i>that happened
is from a bad thing.</i>

<i>Jimmy Whiskers found
a 13â€pound nugget of gold
in the ashes.</i>

<i>Lucky Jim. Unlucky Diggins.</i>

Youâ€™re not leaving,
are you, Bernard?

Reckon I am, Missus.

Uh, I was talkinâ€™
to that fella,
that Jed there,

and, uh, he told me about
these fellas, lawyers,
in San Francisco.

Help a colored man like me
get free of slavery.

Iâ€™m gonna be free.
Legal free.

I wish I was free.

But it seems like
Iâ€™m stuck here like mud.

Miss Lucy, now, it could be
that hereâ€™s where
youâ€™s supposed to be stuck.

Godspeed to you, Miss Lucy.

I donâ€™t know what to do.

Why does everything
have to change?

Why canâ€™t life
just stay the same?

MR. WHIPPLE:
<i>It wouldnâ€™t be life if it did.</i>

Papa!

<i>What if you had your wish
and nothing changed?</i>

<i>Then nothing would grow,
not even you.</i>

<i>And I wouldnâ€™t want that.</i>

<i>Change is a gift, Lucy.</i>

Papa!

Papa?

Papa.

Now, what do you think
the good Lord has planned
for us now?

Weâ€™ve been through the fire.
Maybe the flood.

Week before the fire,
I was pickinâ€™ berries
up at Calico Meadow,

and there were
all these butterflies.

They were yellow and blue

and like a carpet.

And never before had I seen
more evidence of God,

like Godâ€™s palette.

And as I watched,
I thought to myself,
I said,

"Arvellaâ€™s more alive
than all these butterflies.

"Sheâ€™s more real.

Sheâ€™s more beautiful."


This was my favorite pan.


Thank God
he brought you here.

Amen.

The question is that

if he wants me to go...

will you come with me?

Seems like a lot of people
are moving on.

Leaving Lucky Diggins.

Well, who wants to live
in filthy ashes, Mama?

I thought weâ€™d come
and stay here forever,

but now I know
that my heartâ€™s desire

is to always see
whatâ€™s on the other side
of the mountain.

Where are we going, Mama?

Well...

that depends.

Clyde is leaving.

Heâ€™s going
to the Sandwich Islands

to be a missionary
to the natives there,

and he wants us
to go with him.

You and me and Prairie.

The Sandwich Islands?
Yes.

You canâ€™t be serious, Mama.

Where are
the Sandwich Islands?

And why would he want us
to go with him?

Heâ€™s asked me to be his wife.

His wife?

But you donâ€™t even
like preachers.

But Clyde is different.

Heâ€™s a seeker and heâ€™s good
and heâ€™s kind.

And I think that, with time,
I could come to love him.

If you knew
I wanted to be safe,

why would you drag me off
to some remote island

with murdering savages?
We will be safe.

Clyde will make a fine father.

He loves you and heâ€™ll
protect you.
I had a father!

And you have forgotten him,
and I havenâ€™t.

That is not true.
Neither have I.

Go to the Sandwich Islands.

But I wonâ€™t.

I wonâ€™t go, either.


Is this rock taken?

No.

So I heard the stagecoach

is cominâ€™ through
Rabbit Creek next week,
goinâ€™ east.

Iâ€™m gonna be on it.

Do you wanna go?

Yes.

But I donâ€™t think
I have enough money.

I do.
I made a lot of money here.

My corset is my bank.

But Iâ€™m pregnant,
so Iâ€™m quittinâ€™.

Well, are you getting married?

No.

But Iâ€™m gonna say I was
and he died in a fire.

But my critterâ€™s gonna
be born on the trip,
so Iâ€™ll need help.

If youâ€™ll do it,
Iâ€™ll pay your way.

Yes.

Really? Yeah?

Deal?
Deal.

No, you may not go back
with Sophie Meagan,
and that is that.

Mama, I ran the boardinghouse
when you were sick.

I can live in the forest
if I need to.

I can take care
of Sophieâ€™s baby.

Now, going west again
is Brother Clydeâ€™s dream
and yours,

not mine.

Iâ€™m going home.

Youâ€™re just a child.

Iâ€™m 14, Mama.

Now, go find
your heartâ€™s desire
and let me find mine.

Sheâ€™s a strong, smart girl.
Sheâ€™s gonna make
a fine woman.

I hope my biscuits and pies
werenâ€™t that bad.

MAN: They were good, hon.

I wish I never said
you donâ€™t have souls,
â€™cause I was dead wrong.

And Iâ€™ll miss you all
horribly.

[LUCY SIGHS]

Now, donâ€™t talk back to Mama
like I did, okay?

I wonâ€™t, Lucy.

Love you.

Brother Claymore,
Iâ€™ve been thinking.


I love my real pa,

but if I canâ€™t have
my real one,

then Iâ€™d rather you
than anyone.

Thatâ€™s about the nicest thing
you couldâ€™ve said to me.

So take care of them.

Well, between God and me
and your daddy in heaven,

thereâ€™s nothinâ€™
thatâ€™s gonna happen to them.

Iâ€™ll miss you.

Weâ€™ll see each other again.

Weâ€™ve got to,
because weâ€™re family.

I want you
to have this locket.

Mama.

I love you.


I love you too.

Goodbye, all.

Byeâ€bye.
So long, darlinâ€™.
Weâ€™ll sure miss you.



Bye.
Goodbye.

You all right?

Mama?

PRAIRIE: Mama, look.

[â™ª]

You were right, Mama.

You told me
to follow my heart,

and my heart is yelling at me
to stay,

so Iâ€™m staying here,

in godforsaken, burntâ€out,
washedâ€up Lucky Diggins.

[ALL CHEERING]

And Iâ€™m gonna need
a library,

because thatâ€™s
my heartâ€™s desire.

So Iâ€™m staying put.

My goodness,
but you are muleâ€stubborn.

Just like you, Mama.

LUCY: <i>Dear Mama, Clyde
and Prairie,</i>

<i>weâ€™re rebuilding the town
with a new boardinghouse</i>

<i>and a real library.</i>

Mr. Scatter,
will you make sure
this roof doesnâ€™t leak?

We donâ€™t want the books
to get wet.

We will.

Lucy, I want my boys
to learn to read.

Miss Lucy,
I believe this sign
will go real nice here.

Itâ€™s wonderful.
Yes, maâ€™am.

Maybe you could have classes.

I know a fistful of miners
who might sign up.

LUCY: <i>The miners all pay
a dollar a month</i>

<i>to run the library,</i>

<i>and pay me,
the head librarian.</i>

<i>We already have 81 books.</i>

<i>New folks arrive every week.</i>

<i>I miss you all horribly,</i>

<i>but you were right all along
to bring us here, Mama.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Your loving daughter,
Miss Lucy Whipple, librarian</i>

<i>and heartâ€™sâ€contented citizen
of Lucky Diggins,</i>

<i>where things change every day.</i>

[â™ª]
