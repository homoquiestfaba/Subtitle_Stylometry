â™ª You want any time that you
like â™ª

â™ª Any time that you like â™ª

familiar lucky strangers

who are playing tonight on
the third day

of Milwaukee's own
starfest music festival.

You'll have fun if you're going.

All kinds of music stages
supported by area corporations

and yummy food by some of your
favorite restaurants.

Temperature is already
75 degrees on its way up

to a hot and humid 92 by
the after...

â™ª

(horn honking)

good morning, Mitchell.

Hey.

It's just me.

So how are you?

I messed up, I'm sorry.

Your nightgown
is kind of brown now.

Look, uh, I'm taking
dad's boat out.

Hope that's okay.

Boy, You're up early.

Going camping or what?

I'll give that to her.

Great.

(station phone ringing)

hey, Mitch.

Take a look at this.

We could use someone like
you around here.



applause

as they attempt
to water-ski across the lake.

All 80 miles!

(applauding and cheering)

woo... yeah!

Going 80 miles!

This dude's going 80 miles!

Duly noted!

Across the lake!

Across the lake!

(crowd chanting) across the lake,
across the lake, across the lake!

(engine starting)


(motor revving)

â™ª And I don't wanna waste my
time on you â™ª

â™ª Taking cures â™ª

â™ª And I don't wanna spend
my time on you â™ª

â™ª Hoping for more â™ª

â™ª


(motor whining)

hey!

Hey!

Over here.

Are you all right?

Hey!

Over here.

I'm coming to you, all right?

Are you all right?

Hey, are you all right!

Hey!

Hang on!

Come on, give me your hand.

Reach!

All right, I got you...
I got you.

Come on, hold on.

Be careful.

Ahh!

Come on, get your leg up.

Come on!

Ahh!

(motor sputtering)

who the fuck are you?

What am I doing on this boat?

Your plane crashed...
I rescued you.

Where is it?

Your plane?

No... the backpack!

Get it.

Bring it back here.

You stay up there...
Throw it back.

Throw it!

Where are you from?

From Milwaukee.

What's your name?

Mitch Lowe.
Lowe?

Yeah, Mitch Lowe...
What's your name?

You don't know who I am?

I'm supposed to know you?

Oh.

Oh, my arm.

Is it.
Did I break it?

Yes, it's broken.

Sol put it in a splint.

Ah... I can't
move my fingers.

I don't know how long you
were in there,

but the cold probably
kept the swelling down.

My chest feels like it
was crushed.

Must have hit
the yolk when I came down.

So you're from a world where

people just pull knives
on each other.

Yeah.

We lost the prop.

No service.

Not all the way out here.

What the hell...
Just more shit.

So who are you?

Where are you from?

Michigan.

Michigan.

I've been there.

â™ª

What's your plan?

I'm paddling.

Paddling.

What direction?

West.

I don't think so.

You're paddling in
the direction of the clouds,

which prevail generally
from the west.

Especially this time of year.

Which means you're moving
to the east.

Look...

I gotta get to Wisconsin.

Well, that's why I'm
paddling west.

I agree we should be
heading west,

but it's the other
direction, I'm telling you.

I know what I'm talking about.

Ow!

Anything to eat?

You have nothing onboard to eat?

Plenty to drink.

Freshwater lake, but don't
kid yourself.

If you drink this
shit, you'll have the runs

till kingdom come.

No way.
Oh yeah.

There's been significant
progress

over the last few years.

The lake is actually improving.

I've forgot more about this
lake than you'll ever know.

Trust me.

You know what?

The school of fresh
water science

has some interesting
things to say on the matter.

For example, some of these
big boats,

they come in off
the ocean, like the Caspian sea,

they've got these
invasive mussels

that are on the bottom of them.

They let go, they go down
about 300 feet

and they're like filter fish.

My understanding is they're
helping clean things up.

How great is that?

You know what?

Why don't you stab me after
I give you some water?

Who'd you call?

What do you mean, who'd I call?

You said you called for help.

Who'd you call?

No I didn't...
I didn't say that.

You got no radio?

What are you doing out here in
the middle of the lake

with no cell phone,
no radio, no ship to shore?

â™ª

What's that?

Whitefish...

Pickled in sour cream
and chives.

It's herring.

Open it.
No way.

Open it.
No way.

That thing hasn't been in
a refrigerator in like 20 years.

It's toxic.

Yeah.

Shit.

It's actually a pretty
good product.

My mom was a bookkeeper forever.

You didn't
take my wristwatch off

when you dressed my
arm, did you?

You didn't, huh?

Thought it would help keep
the swelling down.

No wonder my arm feels like
it's going to explode.

You gotta take this thing off.
All right.

Get my fucking wristwatch off!

Take it off!
Stop, stop!

All right, all right, I got it.

Let go.
Take it off.

Let go... I got it.
It's acting like a tourniquet.

Oh!

Take my watch.

Point the hour
hand toward the sun.

It'll bisect it with
a 180 degree line.

It creates two right angles.

That line is north and south.

Do it.

Do it... I'm serious.
Give me your arm, give me your arm.

I'm serious.

Gin or vodka?

Vodka.

It's a little early for
that, isn't it?

What else you holding out on me?


too early.

You should lift it up.

It's all right.

Lift it up.

What's your
paddling in a semicircle?

Look, Cousteau, who was my idol

I know what I'm talking about.

You're not heading west.

Point the hand to the sun.

Paddle any way you want.

He'll be here soon anyway.

You should elevate it for
a little while.

Keep paddling.

West.

â™ª

Are there...

Do boats have speed limits
out here on the open water?

I don't know.

â™ª

All right.

West.

So you gonna tell me your name?

Kelly...

Enwright.

How'd you crash your
plane, Kelly?

Flying to an
air show in Osh Kosh.

You were gonna stunt fly
in that thing?

What's your job...
What do you do?

I was a, uh, part-time
supervisor at a warehouse.

Was?

Yeah.

Yesterday was my last day.

What's the warehouse?

Just a manufacturer.

Yeah?

God, how do the bugs get
all the way out here?

What's it manufacture,
your warehouse?

Driveway markers.

Driveway markers?

Yeah, you know,
like, on a road, you can see...

Driveway markers.

I guess everybody's gotta
do something.

So was it bad weather that
made the plane crash?

No, I took off before dawn.

No sun glare.

Temperatures are lower.

Less traffic.

Kept it low.

Then what?

Why'd you keep it low?

Hey. Kelly!
Huh?

You kept it low?

Kept it low.

Barnstorming's like ice skating.

Skimming.

You descend and you let the
floats dance a couple times

with the surface before you
take off again.

At 40 feet... or what
I thought was 40 feet...

It was foggy, had to depend
on my instruments.

They let you down.

Must have been a faulty
altimeter.

I thought, uh,
the water was further away

than it turned out to be and
the floats caught the surface.

Stupid.

Anybody can make a mistake.

Why don't you just
keep paddling?

What are you doing out here?

Middle of lake Michigan in
this old tub with no food,

no phone.

How far did you
think you were going to get

in this old dinghy without
more gas?

Sounds stupid to me.

Sounds stupid.

â™ª


I overheard in
a restaurant recently.

The guy said that every
day there are signs

or messengers that
come into our life to help us

only most of us can't see them.

What?

I just don't think like that.

Think like how?

I tried to think
like that and I realized

that most of my life has
to do with water.

Body's made up of mostly water.

I drink a ton of water.

Love to swim in water.

I'm even a water sign.

Pisces.

Think that's the kind
of sign he meant?

I don't know.

What are those two?

Bleach and nitroglycerin.

Is that why you're out here?

That was the basic idea.

What the hell kind of way is
that to kill yourself?

I don't know.

Bleach and nitroglycerin...

Are you some
kind of poet or something?

What kind of idiot are you?

What's up with that?

There are guys who do
it violent ways.

A car.

A gun.

Way you're trying to do it is
like a woman would do it.

Carbon monoxide,
pills, poison liquid shit.

Guys don't give a shit.

Gun to the head, bam.

You're out of here.

I'll tell you what.

Why don't you take
this, okay, huh?

Knife to the heart?

End it.

No?

I've had this since high school.

It would be an honor for
it to take a life.

No?

I'll tell you what.

I'm going to put this over there

and if you summon enough stupid
fucking courage to do it,

it'll be easy to get at.

In the meantime, keep paddling.

Nitroglycerin?

It's liquid dynamite.

Where'd you get that shit?

How are you planning
on doing it?

What difference does it make?

You gonna drink it?

Jump up and down until you
fucking explode?

You asshole holdout.

You want some?

Yeah.

Don't eat all of it.

It's my mother's recipe.

These are great.

Your mother know you're out here

planning on doing what
you're doing?

Yeah, she knows.

Whether or not she can actually
comprehend anything is a.

She dead?

Alzheimer's.

Oh man.

Six years.

Your wife or girlfriend
know you're out here?

I'm not married
and I don't have a girlfriend.

How are you, Kelly?

Hey, john.

I'm good.

You been working some
seriously long hours.

Yeah.

Need any extra money beyond
the overtime?

Yeah.

Okay.

Take this backpack
to your first stop.

Leave before dawn, make
the connection,

three grand is yours.

You in?

Yeah.

That's good.

(plane passing overhead)

when's your birthday?

Mid-march.

What day?

The 21st.

You said you were
a Pisces, right?

Yeah.

How were you delivered?

What?
Caesarean or natural?

How do I know?

Was your mother into astrology?

I have no idea.

My wife knew this woman.

She was expecting, so she had
the doctor do a caesarian

so the kid
would be a Sagittarius

instead of a Scorpio.

So what does that have
to do with anything?

You're a Pisces.

But maybe only because
your mom didn't want you

to be an Aries or a Taurus
or a Leo or some shit.

You saying she messed with
my fate on purpose?

Maybe.

No.

No... no!

The bag was open, all right?

The bottle was in my hand.

The decision was made.

Ow!

Are you trying to tell me that
this isn't my destiny?

Is that what you're
trying to say?

It doesn't have to be.

Put that shit down.

â™ª

Hey!

Help. help!
Help!

Hey, help!

Hey!
Help!

We're over here...
Help!

Help!

Help...
We're over here!

Help... help!

We're here!

Oh, shit!

Hey, help!

Mitch, Mitch, Mitch...
Ow, god!

Mitch!

Mitch!

Man.

Sorry.

You're not a well man.

You need attention.

It was an accident...
I didn't mean to.

What are we gonna do now?

No kidding.

If I don't make my connection,
you'll be dead too.

What?

I don't know who I'm
supposed to meet.

If I don't make my drop,
they'll send guys after me.

And who are you but here
and dead?

What drop?

There's a sealed GPS tracker
in this bag.

They know my flight
plan, they know exactly

where I'm going to be.

If I'm more than
30 minutes late.

What?

They send guys after you.

Are you like some kind
of messenger?

A courier.

This lake has shipping
lanes across it.

Up in the sky there's some

transportation highway
connecting

the bordering states.

Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin.

They criss-cross it a couple
times a day.

It's faster than driving.

And there are no cops.

Fact is, I was looking for
their boat or their plane

since you
pulled me out of the water.

What would they need you for if
they have access to a plane?

Minimize their risk.

I get popped,
I'm just a courier.

If I could have got those
skiers attention,

could have dumped me off
with them and been on your way

and when you were alone,
done the deed.

Now you're in
the middle of my shit.


you all right?

Fine.

I'll take
some of that vodka now.

Thanks.

What are you doing?

I am going fishing.

Like that?

Yeah.

Something my dad and I used
to do when I was a kid.

Are you kidding me?

They got 100-pound salmon
in this lake.

It'll take your toe right off.

Oh!
No.

Yeah.
No.

Yeah.
Did you get a bite?

Watch this.
You got a fish?

I do...
Look at this.

It's a walleye.
You got yourself a fish.

There's no place to cook it.

Too small anyway...
Toss it back.

Throw it back.

You all right?

Yeah, I'm all right.

Here.

Where is everybody...
I'm seasick.

Put a little pressure
on your wrist.

What?

Like this, it'll
help with the seasickness.

H ow?

Three fingers below
the crease of your wrist.

Put... like that... between
the tendons.

Just hold it.

I got a broken arm.

I'll do it for you.

Like that.

Feels weird.

You ever try to
kill yourself before?

I've thought about it.

Who hasn't?

Actually, I have tried
a couple times.

Yeah?

Last week, in fact.

I was on the bridge
on the south side of town.

I just pulled on the wheel of
the car to try to get it

to jump over the guard rail.

I would have fallen 200 feet

into the industrial floor below.

What the hell?

The curb was too high.

My wheel base was too low.

So the car just
kind of banged off the wall

and the tire just skidded along.

Ever try to do something like
that when you're sober?

No.

You were drunk.

A little drunk.
A little.

Which means it was a botched
attempt, I think.

You think it's easy,
you try it some time.

This attempt on the boat
botched too, I think.

I didn't botch this attempt.

You botched it for me.

And I'm not drunk.
Yet.

What, you never messed up
this bad?

No.
You crashed.

Yeah.

You crashed your plane
and almost killed yourself.

Yeah, but I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

Those skiers
might have rescued you,

which means I'm not responsible
for you if you die.

Me on the other hand...
What?

It's because of me that my
father had a job.

Okay.

Someone died because of a
decision that I made.

Almost like you just did.

No way...
I had a choice.

With our help...
People have choices.

With our influence...

Even if you don't make a choice,
it's a choice. we are who we are.

Your dad... we're
talking about your dad here!

Are you a man or a mouse?
We are who we are.

You're a mouse.

When I was a child, my mother
used to say to me,

"if you had another
brain, it would be lonesome."

Talking to you, I finally
understand what she meant.

Regret?

The worst thing about it

is it's like
a debt you can never repay.

We'll see.

Are you like this with women?

Like what?
A pain in the ass.

I don't go out much.

You should get a hobby
or exercise more.

You like to
swim, you should swim.

You married?

Yeah.

Got a picture in my wallet.

A fold-out thing.

Here.

That's my family.

Beautiful.

We were living
in a really nice house.

Way beyond our means, actually

Then the economy
tanked and they cut my hours.

My wife got laid off.

Love you, dad... have a good day.
Mm-hmm.

Love you too.

Started looking into anything
including franchises.

There were some
good ones out there.

For some reason, the good ones
didn't interest me.

There was one in
particular that seemed easy.

Wasn't really my thing, but I
had to have something

and we were running out of time.

It was that stupid stop sign

at the corner of grey fox
and fourth.

And you're
coming down the big hill

and you can see a million
miles each way

that no cars are coming.

You have to make that
sharp right.

So what's the point
of coming to a full stop?

Because it's against the law.

I've seen you do it...
Why... why do you do this?

I don't want to use my
brakes for that.

What?

I don't want
to use my brakes that much.

Why?

To save them...
To save money.

Okay, I'll tell you what.

Next few times we want
to go out to dinner, we won't.

That'll cover the cost
of the brakes.

Use your brakes.

Got so bad
we almost moved into this

really crappy trailer park.

So what was the easy franchise?

Selling electronic cigarettes.

Can you believe it?

Electronic cigarettes...
Me, a health nut.

They don't make real smoke.

I mean.

So I took on more courier hours

'cause I wanted to spend
more time with my family.

You get the picture.

After you've been you've been
in jail a while,

would it seem worth it?

At least I'm trying, which is
more than I can say for you.

Really?

Look, I've forgotten more about
living than you've ever known.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You get to be a pilot.

How many people in
this world get to be a pilot?

You'd be surprised.

Some money and a bunch of hours,

you can pilot a plane.

Remember, I carry
parcels, not people.

It's a whole different
licensing process,

if you want to be
rated to fly anything bigger

than a twin engine
six passenger.

Still.

I mean, one in nine
people in Alaska

have their pilot's license.

Probably out of necessity.


Oh!

Here.

Thanks.

Tastes good.

How's it look?

It's okay.

What's your wife's name?
Kim.

Kim?

You ever think we're kinda
supposed to be like,

what our names are?

You know,
like, Robert Brickhouse

or Karen light or me,

Mitch, Mitch Lowe.

Am I supposed to be low 'cause
that's what my name is?

You don't like it, change it.

If it doesn't matter,
don't do it.

Yeah?

What would Kim Enwright have
to say about it?

Mrs. Enwright would say...

"don't be stupid."

They have a new male raptor
at the nature center.

Red-tailed hawk.

And I just figured out yesterday
that he only has two eyelids.

Now all raptors are
supposed to have three eyelids.

They have an upper lid
and a lower lid

and they have this
third, transparent eyelid

that closes laterally
across the eyes.

And this one
keeps the eyes moist

and it protects their eyes
when they're flying

and it protects their eyes when
they're eating.

But this little guy
just doesn't have that.

Doesn't have that extra bit
of protection.

That's me, Kel.

I'm that extra
bit of protection.

You have to let me in.

You don't, you
don't have to shoulder

everything by yourself, baby,

but I can't help
if you don't let me in.

(Mitch urinating)

holy cow.

Didn't realize we were that
close to Niagara falls.

Jeez.

Now I gotta take a leak.

Got a pail or anything?

God... oh god.

Put it down there.
Just put it down there.


I miss my family.

Probably just
getting out of tae kwon do.

Tae kwon do?

Yeah, they're probably
going rollerblading

or maybe to a movie.

Shit.

I think I'm off by an hour or so

seeing as how we're
in the middle of a lake.

What does the middle of the lake
have to do with anything?

Well, we're smack dab
on top of the time zone line.

Really?

Time's almost right down
the middle of the lake, huh?

I didn't know that.

Yeah.

(radio signal coming
through intermittently

brewers are pretty good
this year.

Yeah?


yeah.
(radio station playing football game)

there you go.

That's good.

You know what the laws are
in Michigan concerning suicide?

Oh, come on.

'Cause if we're closer
to Michigan than Wisconsin,

there could be stiffer fees
and penalties.

Are you telling me that someone
came up with a law

against killing yourself?

Of course there's suicide laws.

And they differ from
state to state.

What do I care...
I'm dead anyway.

Somebody's going
to have to dispose of you.

I don't know about Wisconsin,
but Michigan's conservative.

They could come after
your estate.

I don't have much of an estate.

Doesn't matter...
You'll still owe it.

Somebody's going to be on
the hook for it.

Yeah, how much?

Could be as much
as 10 grand, maybe more.

Wow.

Oh... god.

Oh, come on!

Goodbye, brewers.

Any damage?

Ow!

Ah!

That's gotta hurt.

Man.

They wear helmets?

Who?

The kids, when they rollerblade.

They wear helmets?

I don't know...
They probably do.

They wear those wrist
guard things.

That's good, but you gotta
make sure they wear helmets,

every single time.

I mean, they're
gonna fall... it's guaranteed.

What are you so hot about?

If somebody told you that soon,

you were gonna fall on
the concrete

at 10 to 15 miles an hour,
you'd protect yourself.

Right? yeah, probably
I would, yeah.

Yeah, of course you would.

â™ª

Have you ever split up with
someone and both of you decide

not to talk to each other
for a few weeks,

you know, to kind of see
what it feels like,

if you miss each other and all?

Yeah.

Yeah?

Yeah, but not for two weeks.

But I mean, you think
it's common?

That people do that?

I don't know.

Laurie suggested that we
do that.

That's not good.

Yeah.

Wasn't my idea.

During that time, she went out
with her girlfriend.

She said she met somebody
and that he was her soul mate.

Then she went on a trip with
him to new york.

They went
rollerblading in central park.

She fell down and cracked
her head open.

She died.

Jeez.

How long were you two together?

Not long, but. I think she
might have said yes

if I would have
asked her to marry me.

Maybe she would have.

Nobody

Nobody ever
made me feel like that before.

What are the chances of
that happening,

meeting somebody so fast?

Why didn't she just talk to me?

You know?

I mean, if she was feeling
something before,

why wouldn't she have just...

Maybe there's something that
I could have done different.

Should I have done something,
should I have done more,

should I have tried harder?

Don't do that to yourself.

Not worth it.

I don't even have a picture
of her.

We're sinking.
What?

Look at the back of the boat.

Shit.

Whatever knocked off
the propeller

when I ran over your plane
must have punctured the hull.

Great... now we're the
Edmund-fucking-Fitzgerald.

We're going to have
to shift our weight

to the front of the boat.

Not them?
No.

What's in the bag, Kelly?

Cash.

I was supposed
to pick up a container

at a pre-determined time
and location.

What's in the container?
I don't know.

You don't know...
What do you think?

I know it could be one
of two things,

considering it's
black market and all.

Drugs, maybe...
Probably.

Maybe body parts.

Black market body parts?

There's a shortage.

Kidneys, hearts, eyeballs.

People stop
filling out the donor box

on their driver's license.

How much do you
charge for an eyeball?

I decided what my stock answer
would be if I got caught.

That I was going
to an air show in Osh Kosh,

but I wasn't going to Osh Kosh.

I was going to an
airport outside of Milwaukee.

How did they get you mixed up
in all this?

No other pilots available.

I hear about this shit...
I know what's going on.

Probably $125,000
in this backpack.

$125,000 in that backpack
right there?

Poor choice on their part.

I want to see.

The backpack's lined with
Kevlar.

You can't open it.
We'll see about that.

No, I don't get
paid if the seal is broken.

So we'll reseal it.
No, no.

It's sealed electronically with
UPC or something like that.

It's not possible.

You ever try
to put the plastic seal

back on a bottle of
a salad dressing?

No way to.

You can't open it.

Why not?

I want to get paid.

(sea gull cawing)

is it true what they say, Kelly,

that up in the sky,
a ship's wake

is visible for up to 10 hours?

A ship?

Is that what you see?

Haven't you ever been to

the museum of science
and industry in Chicago?

Of course.

Who hasn't in the Midwest?

Remember learning that?

What?

My mom, dad and I went on
a family trip once

up in door county.

I was a teenager.

We were at the beach
and we all went to the water

at the same time.

My mom and I, we went
swimming immediately.

My dad didn't follow us in.

She said he
was probably hanging back

because he was so spooked
from the year before.

And not knowing, I said,

"what happened
the year before?"

She said that between the cold
water and a hearty wave,

he got overpowered
and for a moment,

in the lake that he loved,

he was drowning.

Huh.

And that afternoon, I went
swimming with him, alone.

Just me and my dad.

I helped him through his fear.

And all he
had to say about it was,

"if I ever die before
your mother,

when she passes,
make sure she's cremated

so she doesn't
get cold."

Hmm.

Jerky.

Forgot.

That's all I got.

Really?

Asshole holdout.

Yeah.

Joseph Lowe?

My dad.

What?

Come on, Mitch, give me
the long and short of it.

On second thought, just
give me the short.

My dad typically bounced
around from job to job.

The beginning of the year,

he found himself
running low on opportunities.

With my mom basically
brain-dead,

he was getting lonely.

So he was hired to do some
general work

around the warehouse.

I got him the job.

I taught him what to do.

He was killed.

His head was crushed.

Man.

Your dad?

I was the one who told him to
go help out with the semi.

I should have
been the one to help.

He was not experienced enough
to do that job.

Here...
You take this.

Fucking do it.

I'd kill myself if I saw
something like that.

I can't get
the image out of my head.

It just plays over and over
and over again.

I just keep seeing it.

The insurance company voided his
policy on a technicality

They said that, um.

Due to his
advanced age and condition,

he wasn't suitable for the kind
of work I had him doing.

Jeez, Mitch.

Nobody's gonna...
The insurance company basically

confirmed the fact that
it was my fault.

Nobody's gonna want to be
near you.

You gotta talk
to someone about that.

But you can just kill yourself.

We gotta get
the water out of this boat.

We gotta get the water out
of this boat.

Gotta get the water out.

Come on.

We got to get you in the bow...
Come on.

Get away from the water.

Come on.

Be careful.

The water.

You need a dog.

Why-you got a dog?

Yeah.

What's it's name?

Joey.

What kind is he?

Dachshund, rescue dog...
Greatest dog in the world.

We were in the woods
a couple years ago

and he got shot.

No.

Yeah... hunter
mistook him for a raccoon.

His hips and his legs
are useless.

One evening, I was reading
the paper in the living room

and I farted really loud.


Joey just looked at me and
wheeled himself out of the room.


that's a good story.

You gave him that opportunity.

You couldn't prevent
what happened.

Same thing
with your ex-girlfriend.

Couldn't prevent what happened.

Thanks, Kelly.

(electronic beeping)

what, it's a bomb now?

GPS tracker.

They must be getting close.


here, hold on...
Hold on.

This cramp in my arm.

Just breathe...
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

Oh, god.
Breathe.

Breathe...
Take a deep breathe.

Take a deep breath, come on.

I want my wife.

I want my wife.


here.

How do you figure out
the shit that women do?

Or men for that matter?

You all right?

Kelly?

Hey!

And that name thing.

You know,
where we are our names.

Reflections of things.

Okay, what about it?

High to low.

High to low?
High to low.

High to low, top to bottom.

I don't understand.

Top to bottom.

Yeah... you okay... don't
close your eyes... hey, Kelly!

Don't close your eyes,
all right?

Can you keep
your eyes open for me?

It's not time to sleep
right now... you okay?

Balancing.
What?

Balance?

Time.

The time.

The time?
The time.

The time...
You want to know the time?

I got your watch.

The time, the time
in Michigan is 6:17.

It's 6:17!

It's 6:17 at home,
okay?

Kelly, open your eyes...
Open your eyes.

Come on... come on!

Just stop it.

All right... well, just
stay with me.

Just breathe, okay?

Anxiety will kill you.

Often times I think of that
guy who got arrested

trying to bulldoze down
this free-standing ATM machine.

Yeah?

You okay...
I don't understand.

Think of the anxiety

The stress that guy was feeling.

I realize...
What was I talking about?

You were talking about somebody
with an ATM machine

and stress
or anxiety or something.

Oh!

You all right?
My head!

It's okay.

Hey, it's all right, just
breath.

Where am I?
Just breathe.

Hey!

Hold on now.

Come on, breathe...
Breathe.

You gotta breathe.

Breathe, come on!

Kelly!

Kelly, you gotta breathe!

Breathe!

Breathe, take
a deep breath, come on!

Shit!

Come on, man.

Come here.

All right, come on.

Come on, you ready...
Here we go.

One, two, three.

Come on, come on.

One, two, three.

Come on, man.

Good.

You okay?

Good.

That's right.

(phone ringing)

hello?

Kelly.

Uh, who's this?

Is this Kelly?

I need to speak with Kelly.

Can you tell me who you are?

I have been trying to reach
Kelly all day.

I understand, but I need
to know who you are.

Is he the one the boat with you?

Give us the backpack.

Do you have it?

You want the backpack?

Fine.

You want the backpack?

Take it.


9-1-1, can I help you?

Yes, hello,
is this 9-1-1?

Hello?
9-1-1, may I help you?

Hi, we're... we need emergency
assistance right away.

What is
the nature of the emergency?

I have a plane crash victim.

He's in his mid-50s and he's
in convulsions.

Where are you located?

We're on lake Michigan.

In a little boat that's sinking.

You need to be more specific
about your location.

I don't know... we're in
a small sinking boat.

We're on the lake.

I hope that's Milwaukee
over there.

Okay, can you be more specific?

No, I can't be any
more specific!

We're in the middle of a lake!

Please try to remain calm.
Please come.

Hello?

All right, here's what
we're going to do.

Here's what we're going to do.

You all right, buddy?

We're going to call Kim.

How about that...
Is she in here?

I'm going to call Kim right now.

There it is.

Kim.

Calling Kim right now.

You want to talk to her?

Kelly?

Is this Kim?

Kelly, where are you?

No, no, this isn't Kelly.

This isn't Kelly.

I have Kelly here, he's hurt.

My god, it's been hours.

He's hurt, but he wants
to say hi to you.

He can hear you.

Okay, so say hi.

Okay, say hi.

He can hear you.

Kelly, did something happen?

Can you say hi?

Kelly, are you okay?

Say hi...
She can hear you.

Come on now... you
hear her?

You hear her?

Kim...
Hello?

Hello, Kim?

It's all right, she heard you.

She heard you,
she knows you're okay.

All right, it's going
to be okay.

They're going to
come and get us, all right?

Help is on the way...
Help is on the way.

Breathe...
Goddamn it, come on.

Breathe!

That's right.

Breathe.

Stay with me... no, no, look at
me right here... right here.

Yeah...
Just breathe... that's right.

I know it hurts.

Come on now... they're coming,
they're on their way.

Okay?
