[Man breathing heavily]

[Crowd cheering]

[Bell dings]

Young Charlie: Son...

Elliot...

what do I always say?

Pawns can't be kings.

But what can they be?

â™ªâ™ª

Free.

That's right.

Free to roam.

[Cheers and
applause in distance]

No heavy crown weighing us down.

Man: Round three!

[Crowd shouting indistinctly]

â™ªâ™ª

Listen, I have to
take a fall in the third.

â™ªâ™ª

Don't worry.

It's gonna look a lot
worse than it really is.

â™ªâ™ª

I love you, son.

You never forget that.

â™ªâ™ª

Young Elliot: Dad!

Dad! Elliot: Dad.

Dad! Dad.

Dad! [Camera shutter clicking]

I love you, son.

Woman: [Echoing] Look this way.

[Breathing heavily]

Lean forward.

[Women conversing
indistinctly in distance]

â™ªâ™ª

Sample.

Stand up.

Jacket.

â™ªâ™ª

Your shoes, your trousers.

Sample.

Sit down.

Breathe.

DCI Harks, is he here?

Pardon? Where is DCI Harks?

V-Victoria. Victoria.

D-Detective Chung, is she here?

Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Where are we?

His readings are stable.

I'll be back to check on him.

Aah!

Man #2: Sit.

Who knows he's here?

Man #2: No one, sir. All yours.

â™ªâ™ª

[Light whining]

â™ªâ™ª

Please confirm your name.

Elliot.

Elliot Carter. I'm an
undercover police officer...

Just the questions
I ask, please.

You were present at the
Hotel Reno last night, correct?

Correct. And you came in contact

with Sean Wallace at what time?

Around... 0400, 0430.

Between those two times.

And you left the
location at what time?

I don't know.

You don't know? I didn't
stop to check my watch

when your people
started shooting at me.

What were you running from?

I just told you. No, Elliot.

You didn't. What
department you say

you were with again?

â™ªâ™ª

Sean Wallace blew up
a building two days ago.

That's an act of terrorism.

Terrorism? Hmm.

So, I need to know why you
went to meet him last night.

[Metal banging]


What's that?

What's in the bags?

Now you are asking
the right questions.

â™ªâ™ª

What's going on?!

â™ªâ™ª

[Helicopter blades whirring]

Female reporter: There have
been reports of an explosion

in the city tonight at
the Belvedere Tower.

Male reporter: Emergency
services arrived in record time

just moments after...
As the area was cleared,

the extent of the
damage became apparent.

News of the Belvedere Tower
collapsed has overshadowed

what should've been a
morning of celebration

for Nasir Afredi and his party.

Here's what the new
Mayor of London had to say.

I come to office in
the advent of a disaster

which has shook London.

Thankfully, the recently
completed Belvedere Tower

had not yet opened,
and no lives were lost.

Emergency services have
been working through the night

to eliminate any immediate
danger to our civilians,

and, as always, the
people of London

have come together... Well,
thank you very much, Mr. Dumani.

We'll be in touch. in the spirit
that they are known best for.

Reporter: Mr. Afredi, do you
have any more information

about what could cause a
new building to collapse?

For now, I can confirm
a thorough investigation

is under way to determine
the cause of the blast

which took down Belvedere Tower.

So I ask you all to remain
vigilant, and as your new mayor,

I will do everything in my power
to protect this city from harm.

â™ªâ™ª

Harks: His death's on us,
Vicky. Anthony was a good cop.

How do I explain
that to his family?

Tell me, how the fuck
do I explain that, Vicky?

I just need you to listen
to me. I know... Wait...

I'm going after Elliot.

What?

He can stand trial
with Sean Wallace.

I want you to talk to Elliot's
girlfriend, Shannon Dumani.

Get as much information
from her as you can

before they shut
this thing down.

I'm sorry, Vicky.

I know how much you put into it.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Hallowed be thy name.
Hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come.
Thy kingdom come.

Both: Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day
our daily bread,

and forgive us our trespasses
and forgive us our trespasses

as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation,

but deliver us from evil.
But deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory

forever. Amen.
Forever. Amen.

I don't know where Sean is.

Give me time.

I'll get him away from London.

He shot me, Marian.
He could've killed me.

But he didn't.

For Christ sake,
Ed, we're family.

He took down their building.

They want you and
Sean dead, Marian.

And if I don't deliver
that, Alexander dies.

Tell me where he is, and I'll
spare Billy and Jacqueline.

â™ªâ™ª

[Heavy hip-hop music playing]

[Indistinct conversations]

â™ªâ™ª

Alex: [On phone] You've
got our investors' attention.

Sean: Good.

Soon I'll have the
world's attention.

Every building I take down
will bring more questions.

They want to meet.

Face to face, make a deal.

[Heavy hip-hop music
playing in distance, muffled]

â™ªâ™ª

Face to face?

â™ªâ™ª

Yeah.

Okay.

I'll send you my address.

We go together.

â™ªâ™ª

Okay, brother?

Yeah.

â™ªâ™ª

[Cellphone beeps]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Knock on door]

Cameron: We've unlocked that
cop's phone for you, Mr. Wallace.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Line ringing]

Oh, come on, come on, come on.

â™ªâ™ª

[Cellphone vibrating]

â™ªâ™ª

[Cellphone beeps]

Sean, mate, where
the fuck are you?

I'm out here by myself.

Look, we're gonna be
stronger if we're together.

But I don't know
where you are, so...

call me, please.

â™ªâ™ª

[Cellphone beeps]

â™ªâ™ª


Fuck, fuck, fuck!

â™ªâ™ª

Reno, Reno, Reno.

That's gonna bug me. [Chuckles]

In what state is Reno situated?

Duncan: Nevada.

â™ªâ™ª

Okay. Let's get back to it.

Why did you run when the
officers arrived on the scene,

Elliot?

For my safety.

Police have the right to
shoot a suspect who runs.

You know that.

So why did you shoot back?

I was confused.

Or maybe you were
acting on an order.

What? Who gave
you the order to run

when the police
entered the building?

No one.

Mr. Duncan. No one.
I don't know what...


[Muffled groaning]




â™ªâ™ª

Come on, now. Who ordered you?

You're pissing me off, Elliot.

No one ordered me!

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Talk to a Victoria,
Detective Chung.

She's my handler.

Or Harks, DCI Harks. Talk
to Harks. He'll back me up.

Harks? Oh.

Talk to Harks. He'll
tell you everything.

Harks. Yes, your
superior, Harks.

â™ªâ™ª

No.

I don't think he will.

â™ªâ™ª

We're your only
friends now, Elliot.

You're on your own.

No. No, I didn't do that.

I didn't do that!

No!

[Both grunting]

I wanna know about the people
who invest in the Wallaces.

I wanna know if you had
any contact with them.

And I wanna know who the
fuck you are working for now.

Because it ain't
Her Majesty's Police.

â™ªâ™ª

[Bell tolling in distance]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Mr. Kapadia?

â™ªâ™ª

Here's where we're at. I've been
on the phone to Asia all night,

and our clients have
been completely reassured

that their assets are all safe.

When America wakes
up, I'll be on the phone

first thing to New York,
and then the West Coast.

You know, our underwriters,
they've been working overtime.

Guys, I am telling you,

there is nothing to worry about.

Mr. Kapadia, your
time has run out.

We can help you, or
you can help yourself.

[Car horn blaring]

[Car horns beeping, honking]

[People arguing indistinctly]

Asif: You are
very kind, minister.

My son is a genuine person.

I'm on my way to see
him, and I'll pass that on.

Right.

Thank you.

[Cellphone beeps]

Henry, I'll walk the last block.

[Car horns continue beeping,
people continue arguing]

Who won?

Nasir Afredi? Who won?

Yes. Actually, Nasir is my son.

Aw, he's such a lovely man.

I just met him at
the victory party.

You must be so proud of him.

I am.

Asif Afredi.

Pleasure to meet you.

And what is your name, my dear?

Nasir got my vote.

We're all looking forward
to hearing him speak.

â™ªâ™ª

[Laughter, dance music playing]

â™ªâ™ª

[Music fading]

â™ªâ™ª

Oh, Mr. Afredi,
are you after Nasir?

He took a meeting
with a journalist.

They're upstairs.

Thank you.

â™ªâ™ª

Nasir.

Oh, thank God.

I don't know what
I was thinking.

â™ªâ™ª

[Gasps, speaks native language]

â™ªâ™ª

[Murmuring in native language]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Well?

It's done.

You got what you wanted.

I feel nothing. Nothing at all.

At least honor his
death with satisfaction.

You are judging me?

Why did you come back here?

I've helped you get Asif.

What do you expect from me?

Nothing.

I'm going back to Kurdistan.

I'm not like you.

I only wanted to hurt one man.

All the other bloodshed's
because of you.

You're prepared to
let your own family die?

That's the reality
of my struggle.

We suffer.

This life's a choice for you.

I didn't choose this.

Every penny I make
goes back to Kurdistan.

I stand for the
freedom of my people.

Who do you stand for now, huh?

Your business is over. Your
family's being hunted down.

Why are you here?

â™ªâ™ª

Fuck you, Sean Wallace.

â™ªâ™ª

Woman: [Automated] Please
leave your message after the tone.


Jevan, it's Alex.

I have a solution
to our problem.

I'm on my way over.
It's gonna be okay.

Woman #2: Stand back,
please, sir. Stand back.

[Indistinct conversations]

â™ªâ™ª

[Siren chirps]

â™ªâ™ª

[Siren chirps]

[Indistinct
conversations continue]

â™ªâ™ª

Stand back, please,
sir. Stand back.

Joseph: Did the investors
kill Jevan Kapadia?

I don't know anything
about any investors.

I know you're lying, Elliot.

But that's okay.

We'll get there.

What took you so
long to get to Sean?

Elliot.

[Both grunting]

Tell me how you found him.

Billy! His brother Billy!

Woman: [Over P.A.] All flights and
boarding gates are experiencing delays

due to an increased
level of security.

Please allow additional time
to reach your boarding gate

and passing
additional security tests

before boarding the plane.

Elliot: Billy. Billy,
can you hear me?

I can't find Sean.
I'm worried about him.

He's on his own, Billy.

Listen, Bill, you're safe.

I know you are. But he's not.

Everyone's turned against
him. Everyone wants to hurt him.

Just... tell me where he is

so he doesn't have to be alone.

â™ªâ™ª

Bill.

Billy.

There's an old hotel
by Dagenham Docks.

It got ruined in the '70s. It's
now a club run by Yardies.

They still rent rooms there.

I keep one for when
I need to escape.

If I was Sean,
that's where I'd be.

Room 307, Hotel Reno.

Thank you. Don't thank me.

Just keep my brother safe.

â™ªâ™ª

And if anything
happens to him...

if anyone hurts him...

â™ªâ™ª

I'll kill you, Elliot.

â™ªâ™ª

Ready?

Yeah.

â™ªâ™ª

Female officer: I've
got eyes on Elliot Carter.

He's just finished up on a call,

and he's heading
east on Markville Road.

Stay on him.

We're on our way.

[Siren wailing]

â™ªâ™ª

Carter's heading east on foot.

With any luck, he'll lead us
to Sean Wallace. Let's go.

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

â™ª Fast falls the eventide â™ª

How did we get here? Finn.

â™ª The darkness deepens,
Lord, with me abide â™ª

Finn Wallace
charmed us all to death.

And you chose him.

â™ª When other helpers fail â™ª

You broke my heart.

â™ª And comforts flee â™ª

I tried.

â™ª Help of the helpless â™ª

I'm exhausted, Marian.

Exhausted.

Let me get Sean away from here.

I can't.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Swift to its close â™ª

â™ª Ebbs out life's little day â™ª

â™ª Earth's joys grow dim â™ª

â™ª Its glories â™ª

Ed.

â™ª Pass away â™ª

Marian.

[Helicopter blades whirring]
â™ª Change and decay â™ª

[Silenced gunshot] â™ª
In all around I see â™ª

â™ª In all around I see â™ª

â™ª O Thou who changest not â™ª

â™ª Abide with me â™ª

[Voice breaking] I'm sorry.

â™ª I need thy presence â™ª

â™ª Every passing hour â™ª

â™ª What but thy grace â™ª

â™ª Can foil the
tempter's power? â™ª

â™ª Who, like thyself â™ª

â™ª My guide and stay can be? â™ª

[Knock on door] â™ª Through
cloud and sunshine â™ª

â™ª Through cloud and
sunshine, Lord, abide with me â™ª

Shannon Dumani?

Shannon: Yeah.

Can I have a word?

I want to know about your
ex-husband, Steven Young.

What about him?

You say he's in
prison, but I couldn't find

any of his records.

I did find the missing person's
report his mother filed in 2016.

People go missing all the time.

Who you protecting, Shannon?

Your dad?

Your brother?

Look, I know your
husband wasn't good to you.

No, you know fuck all.

You've got a good poker face.

Could use someone
like you on the inside.

I need an informant.

You are out of your mind.

And I would hate
for social services

to think that there was anything
wrong with Danny's welfare.

You fucking threaten me again...

I don't give a fuck how
some wife beater met his end.

But if leaning on this
gets you on my side...

then, yeah.

I just want Sean
Wallace, Shannon.

I only told Elliot
he was in prison.

Does he work for you?

Elliot's no longer on the case.

He fucked up too many times.

You'll never see him again.

So he's police?

Was.

Look, I know you're
not like your family,

and I know you just wanna
protect Danny, I get it,

but is this really the
best life you want for him?


Think about it.

Come and work for
me, and I promise

I will get you both out.

Does anyone else know
that you're here? 'Cause...

if my dad finds out...

No.

Just between us.

I'm sorry. I just need a moment.

â™ªâ™ª

[Phone line ringing] Elliot:
Come on, Vicky, pick up.

Pick up, pick up, pick up.

Woman: [Automated] Hello.
This is Dave's Mechanics.

Please leave a message,

and we'll get
back to you. [Beep]

It's me.

Sorry I ignored your calls.

Look.

I've got Sean
Wallace's location.

I'm bringing him in.

This is it.

He's gonna stand trial.

Hotel Reno, Dagenham Docks.

Room 307. That's all I've got.

I'm sorry, Vic.

I'm gonna make sure
this has all been worth it.

â™ªâ™ª

And, Vic...

look after yourself, okay?

â™ªâ™ª

[Cellphone beeps]

â™ªâ™ª


Shannon: There's a lot
you don't know about me.

What the fuck? [Gunshot]


â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Mr. Carter.

â™ªâ™ª

Did the investors get to
you before Reno, Elliot?

[Muffled screaming]

Who are you working for?

[Muffled groaning]

What was said? What
did they have you do?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Female officer: U.C.
Carter is on the move.

Harks: Don't let
him out of sight.

I'm preparing an SFO unit.

[Siren wailing]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[Indistinct conversations]

â™ªâ™ª

[Cellphone vibrating]

â™ªâ™ª

Sean: Glad you made it, Elliot.

Come on up, my friend.

â™ªâ™ª

Female officer: Assembling SFO
units outside Hotel Reno, over.

This is DCI Harks.
We'll wait for Carter

to bring Wallace
out into the open.

Await my instruction. We
can't afford any more casualties.

[Indistinct conversations]

â™ªâ™ª

[Heavy hip-hop music playing]

â™ªâ™ª

Give us the fucking money!

Where did you fucking
put it? Where is it?

Male officer: Sir, confirming that
Carter has entered the building.

[Heavy hip-hop music playing]
It's pretty crowded in here.

[Heavy hip-hop music
continues playing]

â™ªâ™ª

[Heavy hip-hop music
continues playing, muffled]

â™ªâ™ª

I'm here to see Sean.

Who are you?

Elliot. Man: Arms up.

What? No weapons in here, mate.

We're a hippie commune.

I'll look after that for you.

[Heavy hip-hop music
continues playing, muffled]

So you got to Billy?

We're worried about you, mate.

That's very sweet
of you, Elliot.

Belonged to Anthony, that
undercover you went after.

Dead, along with
Colin, apparently.

Had some interesting
messages, too.

Messages about you.

And the people you work for.

[Gun cocks]

You fucking snake.

You disgust me.

There's nothing
worse than your kind.

I can think of worse.

I let you into my home
the day of my dad's funeral.

You sniveled your
way into my family

using some lie about
a dead wife and child.

It's not a lie.

Who are you?

Just police. No.

You're messed up.

Why do you want to take me down?

It's not personal.
You're a criminal.

You have to request
to go undercover.

You didn't have a life, did you?

Now you're fucking a
gangster's daughter.

Is that exciting for you?

I don't give a shit what
you think about me.

My whole life I've seen
people like you get away with it.

You think you're special.

Different rules apply.

And you're right.

Most of the time.

This some righteous mission?

Nah.

It's just a mission.

[Gun clicks] [Gasps]

I think you've enjoyed this job.

A man taking down the Wallaces.

Gave you a purpose.

Otherwise, you're just a nobody.


I've got something very
special lined up for you.

[Breathing heavily]

[Knock on door, door opens]

â™ªâ™ª

[Water pouring,
muffled grunting]

Who are you working for, Elliot?

Elliot, give me a name.

Elliot, give me a name. A name.

Elliot. Elliot, give me a name.

That's enough. Elliot.

Forensics need a word.

And I need to check his vitals.

Be quick.


He's running out of time.


â™ªâ™ª

Elliot, you've done really well.

â™ªâ™ª

Now I need you to listen
to me really carefully.

[Whispering indistinctly]

â™ªâ™ª

These words.

Do you understand?

[Breathing heavily]

No, no, wait, please, please.

Thank you.

Hello, Elliot.

Thirsty, huh?

I need to make a call.

What the fuck did
you just say to me?

If you want me to
tell you about them,

I need to speak to
my dad. Whoa, whoa.

I need to say goodbye.

Do not fuck with
me, Elliot, hmm?

No more chances now.

[Numbers beeping]

[Line ringing]

Charlie: Hello?

â™ªâ™ª

Hello, Dad.

Elliot?

Is that you?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's me.


Dad, Dad, listen. I've
been calling and calling.

Got into a bit of a
scrape, haven't I?

It's gonna look like I
took a fall in the third,

but I'm gonna
take it all the way.

â™ªâ™ª

Where are you, son?

You... You remember that place

we used to talk
about travelling to?

â™ªâ™ª

Yeah, sure.

I know where you mean.

How about you make a head start?

So soon?

Yeah.

I'll catch up with you.

Oh, Dad...

you was wrong
about one thing, hmm?

Pawns can be kings.

â™ªâ™ª

I love you, Dad.

Never forget that.

â™ªâ™ª

Joseph: I've kept to my word.

Now you keep to yours.

Hmm?

Tell me everything
you know about them.

[Door opens]

When I found out who you were,

I wanted to crack
your skull open.

Then I realized you
might be the only way

for me to get what I want.

My father was hiding cash
for our so-called investors.

Funds meant for
hospitals or schools

in some piss-poor
corner of the world.

Real corruption.

That building I blew up,
80% of the capital used

came through tax havens.

All the people involved.

All the companies.
Years of information,

years of implication on there.

Why are you doing this?

Ah, I got it wrong.

I've been punishing
the wrong people.

You want me to go after
the people you work for?

The buildings they own,

there are bodies
in the foundations.

Work with me.

These people will never see
the inside of a prison, Elliot.

They build them.

Now you sound righteous.

I'm on a fucking crusade.

What about Alexander?

He already chose
his side of the fight.

too gone today, ha â™ª

â™ª Don't care at all
what the haters say â™ª

Cameron: Stop.

Raise your arms.

[NEFFEX's "Messed Up"
continues playing in distance]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª But I can't seem to say
no, man, to another hit â™ª

â™ª If you figured it out,
this is a metaphor â™ª

â™ª My apartment is looking
just like the corridor â™ª

â™ª By the end of the
night, I'll need a coroner â™ª

I'm asking you to
look beyond the circus.

Take down the real showmen.

[Knock on door, door opens]

Cameron: Alex Dumani.

Sean: Let him in.

Brother.

How are you?

I need to speak to Sean alone.

No, Elliot stays.

Okay, then, let's me and you go.

No.

We're all staying 'round here.

Say what you've gotta say.

I know there's no
investors waiting.

[NEFFEX's "Messed Up"
continues playing in distance]

You fucked it, Sean.

What did you expect to achieve,

directly attacking
our investors?

The Wallace organization's
hanging on by a thread.

They killed Finn, now Jevan.

You can't win.

[Chuckles quietly]

What? Something funny?

Yeah.

You still think any of
this means anything?

Wake up. Think
about what we built.

It's all sand and lies.

And billions of fucking pounds!

Which we could've lived on!

Spent, invested, done
whatever the fuck we wanted!

You know, people kill for this.

My father must've
recognized himself in you.

Your filthy greed. Fuck you.

If you want to take his place...

you're gonna need to be
good at more than just numbers.

â™ªâ™ª

If you do this, Alex,

you'll never come back from it.

I promise you.

No one else knows you like I do.

The shit we've survived.

There's no one on
the planet like us.

No. No one.

[Gun cocks]

It's too late, Sean.

If you kill me, Alex...

you'll be alone.

You know that, don't you?

Think you can do it?

You're not an evil
bastard like your dad.

Shut up. How many has he killed?

Fucking gravedigger.

We're nothing like
our fathers, Alex.

It don't fucking
matter now, does it?

'Cause I don't have a choice.

Yeah.

You do. You took down my family.

No, you have a choice.

You're the smartest
person in the room.

Cleverest man I know.

[Muffled hip-hop music playing]

We can work this out, Alex.

Just me and you.

Think about it.

Really think about it.

I have thought about it.

I fucking love you, Alex.

Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

[Breathing heavily]

We started together.

We can fucking take
them down together.

â™ªâ™ª

Me...

and you.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

It's alright. It's alright.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

No! [Gunshot]

Male officer: Shots
fired! Shots fired!

Go, go, go, go, go, go!

â™ªâ™ª

Ms. Kane: Mr. Carter.

â™ªâ™ª

Sean Wallace must
never stand trial.

â™ªâ™ª

Alex Dumani must remain in play.

â™ªâ™ª

That is non-negotiable.

â™ªâ™ª

Male officer: Charlie-Bravo
6-2 [Speaks indistinctly]

Who are you people?

[Tires screeching]

â™ªâ™ª

Go, go, go, go, go!
[Men shouting indistinctly]

[Canisters firing,
windows shattering]

Fuck.

â™ªâ™ª

Cover your mouth,
Alex. Cover your mouth.

I'm unarmed! I'm
unarmed. I'm unarmed.

I'm unarmed.

[Police shouting indistinctly]

I am, I am. I am, I am.

I am, I am.

I am.

â™ªâ™ª

Do you understand what we
are asking of you, Mr. Carter?

[Breathing through gas mask]

â™ªâ™ª

We know you have
lost loved ones before.

You have a chance
to save their lives.

â™ªâ™ª

Male officer: Sean
Wallace is dead.

I repeat, Sean Wallace is dead.

â™ªâ™ª

[Indistinct shouting]

[Elliot grunting]

The people who wanted
Sean Wallace dead.

Tell me how to
find them, Elliot.

You've only just
brushed up against them.

I've been on this for...

years.

Help me.

And what about me?

You can be whoever
you want to be.

You can go wherever
you want to go.

We're offering a
life few get to live.

Trust us.

The people I work for...

sent you a message.

Okay.

I am protected under
diplomatic immunity

by the Republic Of Panama.

[Phone dials]

He's saying he's
working with them.

Panama. What now?

Hmm?

Fuck! [Cellphone beeps]

You have just bought your way

into a very dangerous
world, friend.

Shit.

Marian.

â™ªâ™ª

I'm going to help you.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ª Walk out the door with her â™ª

â™ª He could see everyone
dressed in black â™ª

â™ª A class that seem
too far, too fetched â™ª

â™ª She said, "Look at you,
look at you, the game is over" â™ª

â™ª Your cup is full,
your cup is full â™ª

â™ª Stop praying for
more exposure â™ª

â™ª It is obvious
that you're trying â™ª

â™ª Dubious, stop
or you die here â™ª

â™ª You're pretending
but no one is buying â™ª
