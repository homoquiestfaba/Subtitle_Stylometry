I know this has dragged
on for a while,

but it could have been much
worse, relatively speaking.

You did yourself a big favor

by documenting
everything so well.

I can't believe he lost his gun
and tried to blame you for it.

So if all looks in order,
just sign here.

[pen scratching]

And second copy.

[pen scratching]

And that's it, we'll have
our courier deliver these

to Mr. Landers right away.

Congratulations,
you're a free woman.

[horn blaring]

[phone buzzing]

Fuck.

Hello, Mother.

<i>I wanted to call and tell you</i>

<i>that I've been talking
with your sister,</i>

<i>and we've decided
to come to your house</i>

<i>for Thanksgiving this year.</i>

Okay, yeah Thanksgiving's
a week away,

and I remember discussing
in excruciating detail

that this year I
was gonna stay home,

<i>and you were gonna
stay not near me.</i>


<i>your sister's doing quite
well and she can afford</i>

<i>to purchase plane
tickets for all of us,</i>

<i>and Todd flies so much
he has what they call</i>

<i>a platinum status
with the airlines,</i>

<i>so we can all fly first class.</i>

No, wouldn't wanna
be stuck back in coach

with size-questionable element.

<i>make sure that you clear out</i>

<i>enough room for me, your sister
and Todd for four nights.</i>

<i>Make sure that
there's enough towels.</i>

<i>And I know you tend to use
that cheap discount detergent,</i>

<i>but I don't wanna
risk the skin irritants.</i>

<i>So please use Flux
detergent only.</i>

Whoa wait, Debra could afford

fancy first class plane
tickets, but not a hotel?

<i>you're not listening.</i>

<i>Debra isn't paying
for the first class tickets.</i>

<i>Let me explain it to you.</i>

<i>You see when you set up
a membership with the airlines</i>

<i>- and then you fly...</i>
[Nicole screaming]

<i>amount of points</i>

<i>to your account
for each one you take.</i>

<i>The more flights you're on,
the more points you get.</i>

Fuck!
[Mother] <i>Are you with me?</i>

<i>- As you accumulate points...</i>
[Nicole screaming]

<i>membership elevates,</i>

<i>platinum is the highest.</i>

<i>This is what Todd has achieved,
platinum Nicole.</i>

<i>And because of this achievement,
all of us</i>

<i>are getting upgraded to first
class at no additional charge.</i>

Thank you for that, Mother.

What I'm saying is,
why do you assume

you're staying with me?

<i>need your mother, darling.</i>

I'm not Norman Bates.


Nothing.

<i>How are you, how's Jake?</i>

I'm fine, Jake is fine,
everything's fine.

<i>and Todd, I have to say,</i>

<i>they are just doing
exceptionally well.</i>

Oh, well that
really is something.

<i>we're praying for you.</i>

<i>Maybe one day real soon,
things will turn around.</i>

That would certainly
be a feather in my cap.

Okay, gotta go.


â™ª

[horn blaring]

You know, I've been
coming here for years.

I don't know who
you think you are

treating me the way you are,

but I actually don't
even have time for this,

'cause I have to go to work.
I mean, do you understand that?

No, of course you
don't understand that.

You stand behind a counter
all day fetching coffee,

and you can't even
get that right, all right?

Maybe I can change your attitude

if I just had a conversation
with one of your managers,

how about that? Because
you clearly have eyes, right?

And you're capable of
seeing that I have a coupon,

and it clearly states that
I get 20% off my next purchase,

but you're charging
me for the full price.

I can see that
you have a coupon.

Boy, am I ever impressed.

So you can stop
waving it around,

it's not a Polaroid picture.

Okay, so you are so smart.

That's why you make
minimum wage right now.

I also get tips.
Oh, oh, so super smart.

Then why don't you explain to me

why you're charging me full
price when I have a coupon?

Well, if you had
taken the time to look

underneath the
advertised 20% off,

that gives you what,
85 cents savings?

Which some people
might not consider

worth the time and
energy to act like

an entitled buffoon.
Okay...

You would see this offer
actually expired last week.

Do you know how much money
I spend at this place, okay?

You're not the only place
that makes this stuff.

I could go anywhere, all right?

And you know,
I'm gonna be telling everyone.

Believe me, I am better
than you and this coffee shop.

I'll be taking
my business gladly

somewhere else, all right?

No. Stop. Come back.

Okay, all right,
you son of a bitch.

You'll be hearing me
from my Yelp review.

It'll be me, thank you.

Excuse me. [fist pounding]

Can I get some
goddamned service here?

I've been waiting in
that line for goddamn ever.

You too, huh? Yeah.

God forbid you should
have to wait a minute

to get that fucking muffin.

Now, what can I get for you?

â™ª

All right, okay.


Oh, oh, oh yeah.

Oh come on, ah, oh yeah.

Oh come on, oh yeah.

Oh no, yeah, yeah. [yelling]

Yeah. [doorbell ringing]

Ah, ah, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Not done,
not done yet, come on, come on.

No please, keep going.

[doorbell ringing]
Oh fucking goddamn it.

What, what?

Delivery for Mr. Landers?
Yeah, whatever.

Sign there.

You have yourself a great day.

Yeah, they're all great,
aren't they?

Jackass.
[door slamming]

Goddamn it.

Dammit.

So speaking of craziness.

Yes.
[laughing]

My mother announced to me a week

before Thanksgiving
that her and my family

are coming to stay
with me for four days.

Yeah, that's...

It's like going to
the doctor and being told,

"Oh you're fine now, but in
a week you will have cancer."

My family makes my world
constantly grey and stormy

with clouds of shit. [laughing]

Yes, my family is a shit cloud

that follows me around
and rains constantly.

They have umbrellas
for clouds of shit?

Oh forgive me, I misspoke.

My family is not a shit cloud,
but a category five

shit hurricane, that actually
arose from the depths of hell,

and there's not too
many umbrellas for that.

So who's coming, your mom?

My mom, my sister,

and her douche-nozzle
husband person.

Is your dad around?

he died when I was young.

I'm sorry.
[Nicole] No, that's okay.

Of course one of the
best parts is gonna be

telling them I'm divorced,

'cause I haven't quite
gotten around to that yet.

That'll be a nice
surprise for them.

Yeah, if I had told them sooner,

it would just given them
time to plot all sorts of

nifty ways to use that
information against me

and make my life hell.

One of life's
biggest challenges,

figuring out how to
deal with shitty shit birds.

Yes, always gotta play
that shitty shit bird game

and stay one step ahead of them.

It's fucking ridiculous.

my fucking family.

It's really hard
to know what to do.

You know,
in most situations in life,

I feel like I know
what the smart thing is,

but not smart enough to
actually do the smart thing,

which I guess kind of makes
me dumber if you think about it.

Well if you're gonna be stupid,
you gotta be smart about it.

What is that, Nietzsche?

Nietzsche can suck my dick.

He wishes he could say
something that profound.

So obviously you're
a philosopher, what else?

A psychoanalyst?

Might help you deal with people
like your family,

if you could get
inside their heads.

no, are you kidding me?

Holy shit, I don't wanna
know what I'd find in there.

Sounds like a bold adventure.

the human condition

is a terrifying spectacle it's
hard to keep your eyes off of.

I'm happy that you share
my aversions toward humanity.

I don't know if it's
a complete aversion,

more like this weird
push and pull I have

between spending half of my
life depressed, lonely as hell,

feeling like I don't
fit in with humanity,

and the other half absolutely
delighted for the same reason,

I don't fit in
with those assholes.

I like blood.

I like people
with bloody fingers

from clawing their
way out of society's box.

Oh, I'm sorry to say
I don't have bloody fingers,

'cause I actually crawled
my way out so long ago,

they've actually healed.

<i>â™ª I just want to be alone â™ª</i>

Have you ever waded through
the gutters of online dating?

Yeah, couple times.

Well, everybody has
their deal breakers, right?

But it's gotten to
the point that I swear,

people are actively searching
for fault in others.

They spell out
the exact attributes

that their mate must have,

and profiles say things like,

Must have "X, Y, Z,"
or, "Must be X, Y, Z,"

before they'll
even speak to you.

What kind of bullshit is that?

How can anybody possibly
know the exact attributes

that a person they're gonna
connect with is gonna have?

Yeah, those people miss
out on trying new things,

having new experiences
and learning from someone.

Yes, why don't people
wanna go outside

of their comfort zones?

I don't get it, I don't get it.

I hear you.

Well, it's nice to be heard.

It's nice to know someone
that's open to new things.


be anything else?


I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

[Server] Whenever you're ready.
[Nicole] Thank you.

[patrons chattering]

â™ª

So it's getting late,
I need to get going.


â™ª

Well it was really
nice hanging out with you.

I had a good time.
Me too.

I mean, I had a good time too.

Hope we can
hang out again together.

Yeah, I think
that would be good.

[car beeping]

[bag rustling]

â™ª

<i>Oh, hello Nicole.</i>

<i>I was talking with
your sister and,</i>

<i>I think I heard a beep.</i>

[phone ringing]

Thank you for coming in.
Yes, of course.

Is there a problem?

Yes, unfortunately.

Paul is no longer
with the company.

He has turned in his resignation
effective immediately.

Oh really?
Yeah, yeah.

Well, that's too bad.

We want you to
take his position.

Really, VP of Sales?

Well thank you, I'm honored, I...

You deserve it.

You've done really nice
work since we brought you on,

and closing that Robertson
deal was impressive.

Thank you.

Assuming you're on board,
I'd like to

schedule the meeting with
the rest of the executive team

and get you started right away.

Okay, great.

Here's our compensation
and benefit package.

Take it home, look it over.

Let me know if you have
any questions or concerns.

Okay, thank you so much.

I heard you were recently
divorced from your husband.

I imagine this will really help,

now that you've gotta
help yourself out.

Well, I divorced my
husband and I've always...

yes, thank you very much.

You're welcome,

let's touch base
in the next couple of days.

Okay.

â™ª

[phone buzzing]

Hey.
[Nicole] <i>Hey, how are you?</i>

I am so fucking
marvellous right now.

Yeah, me too.

I was wondering if maybe
we could get together again.

Yeah, got a little
time tomorrow after work.

<i>arcade by the cafÃ©?</i>

Yeah.
[Braeden] <i>Let's meet there.</i>

We'll have a super fun time.


<i>Cool, I'll see you then.</i>

Okay, have a good night.

<i>â™ª All I want is
A second chance â™ª</i>

[Jake crying]

<i>â™ª Come on, give me back

[Jake crying]

<i>â™ª We were known
As that couple â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Always hand in hand â™ª</i>
It's good.

It's good.

<i>â™ª No woman every loved so â™ª</i>


Yeah, no, no.

I'm kinda really bloated
and kinda sluggish.

Can I help you?

Yeah no, after three
days you can really feel

the toxins leaving your body.
Hello?


Yeah, so I'm back on caffeine.

Hey.
Yeah, give me a...

No, no, no, not you.

Can you hold one second?

I'll take a cafÃ© latte.

Yeah no, it's just this
person at the coffeehouse.

So anyway,

yeah it was crazy. [laughing]

It was all green and runny.

Yeah, my wife kept calling me

the Green River Killer.

Uh-huh, totally.

Okay, so I'll talk to
you in a little bit, all right.

Yeah, yeah.

Excuse me.
Oh my gosh.

That's so, that's so funny.

[Customer] Can I get...
Yeah,

I don't know if I'll have time.

See, I got this DeVry Institute
valedictorian looking at me.

I really need to kick
him in the fucking teeth.

Oh, [chuckling] nope,
he's a real fuck stick.

Okay, yeah, bye.

How about my latte, fella?

Oh, sorry, that's all
the time we have for today.

My shift's over now,
so better luck next time.

I'd like to talk to the manager.

I'll bet you would, pal.

Hi, can I help you?

What?

[arcade games beeping]

So how was your day?

Special,
just another day in the life

dealing with
entitled ass clowns.

Well that is special.

I close my eyes,
take a deep breath,

go to a happy place,
and imagine all them

poop-butt motherfuckers
getting Hanta virus.

that's sociopathic.

I try and try.

So how are things at your job?

Good, yesterday I
got offered a promotion.

Really?
Yeah.

That's fucking awesome.
Thank you.

So what's the new job?
VP of sales.

Holy shit, well done you.

Yeah, I guess things
are really coming up Nicole.

Well, congratulations.

So.
Yesh?

When's the last time you
laughed really, really hard?

Uh... The other day I saw
someone using a selfie stick,

and I think it's funny
that after 8,000 years or so,

civilization is finally
coming to an end.

So I laughed and laughed.
[Nicole laughing]

What do you dream about?

Oh, good question.

My dreams are usually
these crazy labyrinth places,

and I'm disoriented and
trying to find my way out,

Like I'm a character
in a Kafka novel or something.

What's the craziest
thing you've ever done?

Oh boy.

One time I went to McDonald's
and ate a McRib sandwich.

[Nicole laughing]

Have you seen that thing?

I'm pretty sure
eating one of those

is the craziest
anyone could ever do.

What do you fear?
Besides a McRib?

Besides the McRib.

That no matter what,
I'll always feel trapped,

like I'm stuck in a cage.

And even if there's a moment
where the door was left open,

I wouldn't know what
to do with the freedom,

and I would just run
right back into my cage.

â™ª

So I learned a valuable
lesson tonight.

Yeah, what's that?

I suck balls at video games.

Just try not to take it as
a rejection of you personally.

Yeah, I'll do my best.

â™ª

â™ª

So I got a question.
Yeah?

You talked about not knowing
what to do with freedom,

and that you might just
run back into your cage.

Yeah.

What is it that
you're scared of?

Well, when good things happen,

I see it more like
someone's taunting me,

luring me outta my cage,
and just slam the door closed

right in my face before
I can even get out.

And then I worry if I did ever
break free of all this crap,

would I even know what
to do with the freedom?

Would I even know it's there,
or would I feel like,

my cage is safer.

Of course, then I always end
up with shitty abusive people

who convince me
I'm unworthy anyway,

so I end up feeling
even more trapped.

I'm sorry.

My mother is really
good at sending people

like herself to my doorstep.

â™ª

I'm really sorry,
but I have to get going.


and I have a lot to do tomorrow.

Oh, that's okay.

Hey, I got an idea.

Why don't you come
over to my place tomorrow?

Yeah?

Yeah, we can have dinner.

Hang out.
Okay, that would be nice.

I'll send a text
message to your phone

with my address and stuff.

Okay.
All right, cool.

I'll see you then.
Okay, bye.

Bye.
Night.

Sounds great.

[phone ringing]
This is Nicole.

<i>I've been trying to call you</i>

<i>on your cellular phone, but
I've been unable to reach you.</i>

Yeah, well I've been very busy.

<i>I hope that doesn't mean</i>

<i>you've been too busy
to begin preparing</i>

<i>for Thanksgiving dinner.</i>

I'm gonna get a turkey
whenever I have time.

<i>really don't mean to upset you,</i>

<i>but we're gonna be there
in just a couple of days.</i>

<i>And many people do purchase
turkeys for Thanksgiving.</i>

<i>Why, sometimes even

I'm going to get a turkey,
and it's gonna taste the same

no matter when I get it.

<i>have to cook it for a long time,</i>

<i>and I do realize that sometimes</i>

<i>you have trouble judging time.</i>

Oh my God,
that one time when I was a kid

I missed your curfew,
and that was like, oh my God.

Do you have like
a Nicole mistake roll

that you could just pull one out

at any given moment
to use against me?

<i>you know what occurs to me?</i>

I absolutely cannot wait
to hear what occurs to you.

<i>reading various periodicals,</i>

<i>and some of them contained
just marvellous recipes</i>

<i>to cook a truly magnificent
Thanksgiving meal.</i>


<i>these periodicals.</i>

No Mom.

No Mom.

No Mom,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

<i>I don't mind,

I know that's exactly
what you're trying to do.

[Mother] <i>Well, you just know...</i>
Okay, have to go.

I'm at work, very busy.

<i>wait dear, darling? Oh.</i>

[Nicole sighing]

[sirens wailing]

[doorbell ringing]

â™ª

for having me over.


<i>â™ª I can't shake this
Feeling of weightlessness â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And burning at the
Guilt of being gone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't take to
Wake up in silence â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Knowing that
I did you wrong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What if I could
Dream forever â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Do you dream forever â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Do you dream forever â™ª</i>

That's not how it goes.

Gotta put your arms
into it more at the end.

I was just playing.
Yeah.

Are you all right?

I've just got a lot on my mind.

Like what?
A hole.

A whole lot of just stuff,
work stuff.

And actually I've
been thinking about

your situation a lot,
with your family.

Are you ready for them?

as anyone could be

for dealing with them.

So what are you gonna do?

grin and bear it

and get through it.

This could be an opportunity.

Your mom coming to your house.

It's not like you'd be
stalking her in a dark alley.

What do you mean?

I mean the stereotypical
dark alley.

People forget that
everyone has a fear

of the dark and
unknown on some level.

So when people are
in those situations,

they have heightened senses.

It puts them on an
instinctive fight level

that gives them
a lot of strength,

even more than they
ever knew they had.

I've always wondered
why there's so many of us

that creep in these dark alleys,
somehow forgetting

that people in those
situations are more likely

to fight us off or cause
damage that will get us caught.

And you always
see movies of killers

with this stupid,
crazy shit like,

like leaving their
killer calling card,

or taking trophies from
their victims. [laughing]

I mean what, what a joke?

You never wanna take anything,

and you definitely never
wanna leave anything behind.

That's one of the quickest
ways to get caught.

But I imagine for you,
just having your mom

out of your life
would be trophy enough.

Come on, you wanna be free.

Since she's coming
to your house for dinner,

she's gonna be relaxed, feeling
safe with her guard down,

and here you are stressing out.

Really, it's an opportunity.

If you do it right,
I really think you could.

I'm just kidding around.

Oh.

Yeah, I watch a lot
of "Law and Order."

<i>â™ª Dun dun â™ª</i>

Nicole, Nicole, Nicole.

The fuck are the
fuck are you doing here?

I've been trying to call
you all day, are you okay?

Dude, are you serious?
Why the fuck are you here?

Nicole, I need to tell
you something, it's very...

Leave, get the fuck out.

Nicole, the guy you're
seeing is a serial killer.

What did you just say?

The guy you are currently
dating, serial killer.

No, how do you know
I'm seeing someone?

Nicole, that does not
matter right now at all, okay?

This is a person who kills...
Oh no it matters,

no, it matters.


Okay, okay.

Last week you went to
dinner at Fedori's, right?

Well that same
night after you left,

someone was suffocated
to death right down the road.

And then last night
he was at River Walk Park,

where two people
were beaten and buried,

and I saw him there
with a shovel.

And I've been seeing all
his reports from the news lately

about people being murdered,
and I mean,

do I have to paint
you a picture?

you've been stalking me.

Same old Nicole,
fucking ridiculous.

I came over here to
fucking take care of you,

and you're gonna stand
there like some sarcastic bitch?

Fine.
[Nicole screaming]

Jesus.
[Nicole screaming]

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[Jake thudding]
Okay.

Fuck you.
[casserole splatting]


Okay, okay,
now get it, Nicole, Nicole,

he's a killer,
he's a killer, okay?

Same old Jake, huh?

But you don't get to
talk to me like that anymore,

fucking bitch.

Nicole, let's just put
everything aside for a second.

Listen to me, okay?
He's a killer.

We need to call the police.

Let me take care of you.

You haven't called
the police yet?

No I, as soon as I found out,
I came right over here.

I had to make
sure you were okay.

[Nicole chuckling]
Nicole?

It's a blessing that you came.

He's on his way over here.

What? Holy shit.

Okay, we have to get the
fuck out of here right now.

I am not joking, we need
the fuck out of here right now.

It's okay, it'll be okay.
I'm safe, I promise.

Nicole, seriously.

I hear you, but it'll be okay.

He's not on his way
over here to kill me.

He's on his way over for dinner,

and because he thinks
there's a future between us.

Who knows what he would do

if we canceled
right before dinner.

The best thing is to just
keep it on, like all as normal.


we don't have to cancel dinner.

Couldn't we just like,
call the police

and have them arrest him,
and then it'll be all over?

Really?
You wanna trust the police

to arrest him like that?
Come on.

He's a CIS straight white male.

It's not like they're gonna
believe a hysterical woman.

But...
And believe me,

I have to get
through this dinner.

If anything goes wrong,
you know my mother

would use it against
me for the rest of my life.

Can you imagine if we had
Thanksgiving

in a police station?

so what are we gonna do?

Stay, just stay, and
we'll get through it together

and move on,
really it's for the best,

and we can do it together.

So I'm gonna have Thanksgiving
dinner with your family

and the serial killer
you've been seeing?

Yes.

Oh, okay.

I haven't told my family
that we're separated,

and I was just gonna tell
them that Braeden is a friend

who didn't have anywhere else
to go, so it'll all work out.

What's he gonna think
about me being here?

Well, when he comes,
I'll take him aside

and tell him that they
expect you to be there.

Jesus fucking Christ, Nicole.

Now everybody's
gonna be here soon.

So why don't you go clean up,

and we'll get through
this together, okay?

I'd do anything for you, Nicole.

[knuckles rapping]

Why, hello there, dear.
[Nicole] Hello, Mother.

It looks as if
the lawn hasn't been

properly watered
in quite some time.

my aversion to proper lawn care.

Hi Nicole.
Hello, Debra.

[baggage clattering]

It is really great to see you.

Really, really great.

I am just,

we are just so happy to be here,

and to share this
special day with you.

It's really great.

Okay Todd,
we're having turkey in honor

of Puritans murdering
and slaving,

so let's try to maintain
some composure now.

What is she talking about honey?

Oh I don't know, but your
little sister is the best.

Just the best.

Now Todd darling, why were
you just handling the luggage

with your persistent back pain?

This is something we
all have to be mindful of.

In fact, I think you and Debra

can take the master bedroom.

I'm sure there's plenty of
couch space for Nicole and Jake.

Hey Jake, it's good to see you.

[Jake grunting]

was just dreadful,

positively dreadful.

Yep, a little turbulence.

Yep, yep, there surely was,

but I reckon it could
have been a bunch more worse.


[birds tweeting]

â™ª

Hey.
My ex-husband's here.

What?

So, how are things?

You two getting along terrific?

Oh yeah, just, just terrific.

Just, just great.

Yeah, right on, yeah.

Yeah, I'm really, really sorry.

But he showed up, and my family
doesn't know we're divorced,

so I can't tell them now, fuck.

So Jake,
may I ask, is it you or Nicole

that is tasked with
watering the lawn?

Because might I say,
it appears that task

hasn't been completed
in quite some time.

that'd be my job.

I've been slacking
over there, sorry.

Hmm, just a bit.

So what do you wanna do?

Will you please just stay?

I'll tell them you're a friend

who didn't have anywhere
else to go for Thanksgiving,

and after dinner, it'll
just be the two of us, please.

Yeah, sure.

What is Nicole doing?

She's talking with her...

Of course.
Friend.

Her friend?

Mm-hmm, her friend who's
gonna be eating dinner with us.

[Debra scoffing]

Nicole invited a friend

for a holiday Thanksgiving
family gathering?

Yep.

Oh my.

â™ª

This place could really
use a little cheer.

I think you could stand
to go home accent shopping.

Home accent shopping?
Hmm.

Yeah, Todd and I
just recently purchased

some really nice home accents.

I understand IKEA has
some remarkable products.

We actually went there.

Yeah, it was a week ago, what?
Two weeks ago.

So that would've
been right after

you came back from Atlanta.

Oh, that's right.

Yep, yep,
I was pretty jet lagged,

but she had the list waiting
for me as soon as I got home.

So, no sleep for this guy.

Oh.
Oh.

Mm.
Mm.

got this fabulous coffee table

for only $139, and then
we got a duvet cover for $30.

I believe it was $40.

I think it was 30 honey.

Maybe you're right, honey.

Yeah, oh and then
we went to Lowe's

and we got some patio furniture.

Which goes great
with my Genesis 9000.

That's a grill.

This guy used to never,
ever wanna cook.

And I'm telling you,
ever since he got that grill,

he could stand outside
and just cook all day long.

That is a true story,
if I ever heard one.

Mm.
Mm.

See what I'm talking about,
Nicole?

Have you ever considered
going to IKEA?

Or what was that
other place, honey?

Lowe's.
Yes, Lowe's.

That certainly is
something to consider.

Hmm.


Green bean casserole.

Oh.

Remember when we had
dinner at your home last year,

and you made that sun
choke fennel apple salad?

Wow, now that was
a tremendous meal.

Ah, thanks mom.
Oh well.

Oh.

[gravy splashing]

I, I like gravy.
Oh.

So...

Nicole, how's your job?

Oh, is the marvellous
adventures in patio furniture

and IKEA portion
of the evening over?

'Cause my career
is going very well.

I just got promoted
to VP of sales.

Ooh. [glasses clinking]
Did you know that Debra

and her entire church group

recently spent an entire
evening at a soup kitchen,

feeding meals to the homeless?


to make such a difference
in people's lives.

I mean, if you could just
see the look in their eyes,

just one time,

you would know why I do this.

Amen, not just anybody
could do the things

that Debra does,
you must be very proud, Todd.

She is certainly amazing.
Mm.

[Braeden choking]

Sorry, just a little
something in my throat.

huh guy?

[Todd and Debra laughing]

It certainly is
unusual for a friend

that no one's ever met before

to be invited to
a family gathering,

especially a holiday
family gathering.

Oh Mom, If Nicole wants to have

a friend over for dinner,
just let her.

Jesus, thanks for
granting me permission

to have my friend over to
my house for the dinner I made.

Oh, you're welcome.

Oh yeah Nicole,
this is a great idea.

What could possibly go wrong?

Now, now,
Jake, it's quite all right.

We're all accustomed
to Nicole's behavior.

It's typical of Nicole
to think only of herself.

Her behavior sometimes hurts us,

but we deal with
it the best we can,

because well, we care about her.

Yeah, we do.

So Jake, all in all,

I'd say that you've
been really quiet tonight.

How's everything with you?

Jake?
What?

Fine, fine, thank you.

Well, did you know
that Todd's been traveling

a lot for his job?
He's been a real jet setter.

[Debra and Todd laughing]

Jake and I are divorced.
[Debra gasping]

What?
Oh my Lord.

What are you saying, Nicole?

What I'm saying Mother,
is I divorced Jake.

I'm no longer married to him.

He does not live in this house.

I am a single woman
living my life.

Well, this is quite a surprise,

but I can't say that
I'm completely shocked

that you were unable
to keep a man.

You were never
very good at keeping

much of anything together.

I mean, it's any wonder
that you've managed

to keep a job all of this time.

Now Mother,

let's just placate Nicole,
like we always do,

and we'll deal with this later.

Yes.
Yeah.

Far be it for me to
ruin a family gathering.

Let's just move
on with this meal,

and we'll talk about this later.

Okay.

[silverware scraping]

So then Braeden,
what is it that you do?

Well...
Braeden's a serial killer.

He's a, a killer?

A killer what?

Literally, he's a killer.

He kills people
and gets away with it.

And my adoring wife here
thought it'd be a great idea

to have him in our house.

Ex-wife, my house.
Ah right, sorry honey.

My adoring ex-wife thought
it'd be a great idea

to have a serial
killer in her house.

So who do you kill,

like prostitutes or something?

Honey.
I'm sorry.

I don't kill prostitutes.

They have a hard
enough life as it is.

Okay, I'm sorry,
but isn't the real question

we should be asking
ourselves here is,

what are we gonna
do about the fact

that there's a
goddamn serial killer

sitting at the dinner table?

Okay, Nicole I know I
said we'd deal with this later,

but we have a broken family now.

Why didn't you tell us
that you were getting a divorce?

I mean,
this is just so like you.

So, how many people
have you killed?

Really, that's the question?

You don't ask,
I don't know, how I'm doing?

You don't say, "I'm sorry
your marriage fell apart."

You don't ask, "What happened?"

You know,
I take of fence to that question.

You wouldn't ask a soldier
who's just come back from war

how many people he's killed,
would you?

You know it it's,
it's typical Nicole.

Your sister asks you a question,
and what do you do?

You just turn it around
and make it all about you.

I pray one day you grow up.

I, I, I just,
I have to say something here.

You know,
my father and grandfather

both fought for this
country to give us both

the freedoms that
we enjoy today.

It's the reason
you have the freedom

to go around killing people.

And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit here

and let you talk about
the troops that way.

Jake, sit down.

not even married anymore,

why are you listening to her?

For that matter,
I mean, why are you even here?

Why am I even here?
Hmm.

Why didn't you ask why
there's a serial killer here?

You know, I wasn't
literally comparing myself

to a soldier, by the way.

I was just saying,
like they might take of fence

to that type of question.

I'm sorry.

Well then Braeden,
what was your childhood like?

[Nicole chuckling]

Oh, well your laughter
is quite inappropriate.

It's a completely
legitimate question.

For instance,
if Braeden were to say

that he came from a,
a broken home,

or perhaps he was adopted,

you might understand
why he is the way he is,

a, a killer,
as Jake describes him.

You can really talk
some shit, mother.

It's like a laxative made
shit come outta your mouth.

Honestly, Nicole.
Nicole.

do you kill people?

I'm, I'm sorry,
is that okay to ask?

Yeah, yeah it's, it's fine.


I, I don't really know.

Don't you think,
surely there must be

some kind of a reason?

Probably,
but who can afford therapy?

And by the way,
did you ask if he was adopted,

'cause Christ,
he should be so lucky.

Nicole, don't say that.
No, no, that's okay.

Nicole has never been very
grateful for my many sacrifices.

So how do you kill them?

Are you a shooter,

a drowner,

a strangler, stabber,

a...

cannibalizer?

You know, since this
dinner has become a forum

of brutal honesty,
let me tell you Todd,

I have never liked you.

You're the dumbest motherfucker.

Well, one of the dumbest
motherfuckers anyway,

and you're a creep ball.

You're the kinda guy that
would go up to a girl in the bar

and be like,
"Hey, is your daddy a baker?

'Cause you got
a great set of buns,"

and think you're super cool.

You're the kind
of guy that mothers

would call the police on if
they saw you near a playground.

Of course my sister here
is rather creepy herself.

Maybe in a different
sort of way,

but I guess that's why you
two are, [giggling] so in love.

Wow.

How could you say this, Nicole?

Todd is a good man.

He buys me flowers,
he rubs my feet, he...

I water the flowers
that I buy for her.

Yeah, he waters the
flowers that he buys for me.

I mean, you are just
way outta line here.

Is this seriously
happening right now?

I mean, we're sitting
next to a serial killer,

and all you people
can talk about is this

family drama, and...
What exactly, foot massages?

I mean Jesus,
goddamn, he's a serial killer.

He kills people, but
somehow Nicole is out of line

for saying something
about your husband,

who is clearly a weirdo,
by the way.

That's saying something.

[Debra sighing]
Well,

Braeden is just
being true to himself,

if he is a serial killer.

But what you said was
an attack on my character.

Plus you've been phoney
to me all these years,

pretending to like me, not cool.

That's right.

You really should
be more considerate

of other people's feelings.

Probably another reason
that your marriage fell apart.

Do you people hear yourselves?

I mean seriously, aren't
there more important things

going on here than
your family issues?

Well, this is a family function,

and not a single family
gathering has gone by

that Nicole doesn't act
out and make it all about her.

Don't worry about it, mother.

She's just jealous.

You have no right.

Actually I do, because
Jake's father and grandfather

fought for my right to call
your precious Todd a weirdo.

Huh, right,
yeah, I'm the bad guy here.

And I can see way you
left me over this fucking guy.

What, wait, what?

Wait a minute,

am I to understand that,

that this man is
not just a friend,

but somebody with
whom you're having

some sort of a
sexual relationship?

Wait, am I to understand
that a grown-ass woman

could do whatever the
fuck she wants with her vagina?

[Debra gasping]

I beg your pardon?

I don't know what it is
you're trying to say Nicole,

but I certainly don't appreciate

that kind of language
at the dinner table.

You don't know what
I'm trying to say?

Let me break it down for you.

I'm an adult,

and you don't have
control over me anymore.

None of you people have
control over me, by the way.

Sometimes my decisions
lead to shitty situations,

but I'm pretty sure...
[Mother] I'll say so.

I'm pretty sure that
you are the reason

why I can't have
anything resembling

a normal, healthy,
functioning relationship.

You are the reason why I attract
abusive and violent people,

and you are the reason
why I find myself

in these situations over,
and over, and over again.

And you are the reason
why we are all sitting here

at one big cluster fuck
of a Thanksgiving dinner.


That's really quite some little
performance you've put on,

and might I say,

many from your generation
think that way.

They blame all of their,

their shortcomings
on their parents.

All the while,
indulging themselves in a,

a barrage of medications.

You have hurt me deeply Nicole,

but I'm still your mother.

And I want you to know
that I am deeply concerned

for your well being, young lady.

What you call my shortcomings

are just a result of your abuse,

because I put a big
old sign around my neck,

that told all the
other abusive people

to come on down
and abuse this girl.

But I'm not a victim,

so it is over.

Wow. [chuckling]

Even for you,
this was quite a display.

I think we all need to
take a deep breath...



And regroup and
just try to enjoy

this precious time
that we have together.

Are you really this clueless?

Are you incapable
of seeing anything?

Have you blocked out
what you put me through?

What my childhood was like?

My whole life, did you?

It's like I've been conditioned
to feel love through pain.

Why did you do this to me?

How did you do it?

You're evil.

[silverware clattering]

Okay, I have had just
about enough, Nicole.

I am not going to sit
here and listen to you...

bullshit any longer, and
I'll tell you something else.

I am not going to stay
here in this house tonight.

Oh no, you're not
gonna stay in my house?

But I cleaned the
sheets and everything.

Oh, how sweet of you.

[mimicking crying]

Come on Todd, let's go pack.

We're going to a hotel.

You're right,
yeah this is some bullshit.

Well hey, it was really
nice to meet you, man.

You know who I
would like to kill,

is those guys from that TV show,
"Full House."

You know, Uncle Jesse, Uncle
Joey, just [mimicking choking]

murder them all. [laughing]

[Debra] Todd.
Coming dear.

Come on Mother, let's go.

as painful as this is for me,

I realize that your sister
really needs me right now.


and I'll call you later.

Okay.
Goodbye, sis.

[Debra screaming]
[Debra stomping]

[silverware clanking]

Please pass the potatoes.

â™ª

Nicole, I can't let them...
It's okay.

What are you doing,
don't you think

this fucking sideshow's
gone on long enough?

Jake, don't you start.

This isn't exactly
your shining hour, Nicole.

Mother.
Yes.

Shut the fuck up.

Nicole, I have held my tongue

throughout this entire ordeal.

I am shocked at the
behaviour and the language

I have witnessed tonight.

Why you would decide
to host a Thanksgiving dinner

without telling your
family that you're divorced,

and then inviting your,
your ex-husband,

as well as the man that
you're currently involved

in some kind of a,
an extramarital affair with.

All the while
perpetuating the ruse

that this man is some sort of a,
a serial murderer.

[knife thudding]
[Mother gasping]

Christ, Nicole!

â™ª

What the fuck?

â™ª

[Nicole screaming]
[knife stabbing]

[Nicole sniffing]

What, what, what the fuck?

What, ah, oh, oh God.

[voice becoming distant]
Okay, oh, Nicole,

what the fuck Nicole?

[voice normalizing]
I mean, you killed your mother.

What is wrong with, whoa.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get the fuck back.

Crazy son of a bitch, fuck back.

I'm not messing
around here, man.


[Jake choking]

â™ª

I'm sorry.

â™ª

I, I love you.

[gunshot blasting]

â™ª

Honey, was that a gunshot?

I don't know, honey.

You know your sister lives in
one of those high crime areas.

Great.

[door clattering]

â™ª

You know what else was a crime?

That green bean casserole.

I bet those mushrooms
weren't even fresh.

[knife squishing]

[knife squishing]

â™ª

[door clattering]

Honey, are you okay?

Honey, are you sick on
the green bean...

Wait, what?

[Debra screaming]

[Debra screaming]
[knife stabbing]

[blood gurgling]

[blood gurgling]

â™ª

[indistinct police radio]

â™ª

All right, let's go
through this one more time.

Can you explain why
you had your family,

your ex-husband,
and your new boyfriend

over here at your
house for Thanksgiving?

have all of them over,

just my family and Braeden.

And then Jake
just shows up, and...

And it's at this point
that your mom ends up

slumped over the table with
a bunch of holes in her back.

Your ex-husband's throat is cut.

He's bleeding out in a bowl
of mashed potatoes and gravy.

Your brother-in-law's
head is cracked open.

Your sister was
stabbed to death,

and your boyfriend's
got a bullet in his skull?


Why did Jake show up?

He said that he had
to tell me something.

He said that I was in danger

because Braeden
was a serial killer.

<i>did Jake know that?</i>

<i>Oh,</i> [sniffing] <i>he</i>
<i>said that he was jealous</i>

of me seeing other people,
so he started following us,

and started following Braeden.

He said that he always
saw Braeden in places

where people were
being murdered,

because he saw it on the news.

He said he saw Braeden
at River Walk Park with a shovel.

All right,
so your ex-husband admits

that he's following you,
and that he's figured out

that you're dating
a serial killer,

and he came over here
tonight to warn you?


He must have cared about you.


Why didn't he call the police?

he was worried about me,

and wanted to check on me first.

And then he was gonna
call the police.

the police when he told you?

I didn't believe him.

I mean, my ex-husband
was abusive, and he comes over,

and tells me he's been
spying on me, and, and,

and, and that Braeden's
a serial killer.

I mean, who would believe that?

My mother didn't believe it.

Oh, and then it
all happened so fast,

because Braeden came in and,

and Jake, and he heard Jake,

but Jake didn't see him,
and then Braeden

pushed Jake into the table.

And then he... he stabbed him.

And then he stabbed my mother,

and then my sister came
downstairs and she screamed,

and she ran back upstairs
and then [crying]

Braeden chased after her.

Okay, so not only did
you not call the police,

but you didn't
take this opportunity

to run out the front door.

You just stayed down
here while your sister

and your brother-in-law
were killed.


I, I, yeah I mean,
how was I supposed to stop him?

He's, he's bigger
and stronger than me.

And what was I gonna do?

And then I, I couldn't
remember where my phone was,

and I couldn't think straight.

And then...

I, I checked on
Jake and my mother

to see if they were still alive,
but, [crying]

and, and then I,
and then I found the...

Yes?

There was a gun in Jake's
back pocket.

So, what do you do?

I, I pulled it out

and then Braeden
came downstairs,

and he had a knife, and he said,

"I'm so sorry,
but I have to kill you."

And then he came at me and,
and I thought,

I thought I was gonna die.

I thought I was gonna die,
I'm so sorry.

I didn't mean to. [sobbing]

And so you shot him.
Yes.

[officer whispering]

we've got a unit

over at Braeden's
apartment right now.

It's probably not gonna come
as a big shock to everybody,

but we found evidence
of multiple murders

that were committed
probably by him.

[Nicole crying]

Looks like this is kind of a
clear cut case of self-defense.

A man who apparently
is responsible

for multiple murders
was in your house.

He killed your family,
it was you or him.

Okay, we're gonna
wrap it up here.

We're gonna file a report
with the district attorney,

and then I would recommend
you stay available for them,

but I don't think they're
gonna press any charges.

But I gotta say,

you allowed a serial
killer into your home

and your ex-husband tried to
warn you and you didn't listen,

and now your whole
family's dead.

And this is because
of your actions.

Something you're
gonna have to live with

the rest of your life.


I'm gonna have to
live the rest of my life

knowing it's my fault
that my family isn't here.

Guess you were lucky your
husband came to protect you,

and he had the gun to save you.

I know.

you gonna be okay?


[officer sighing]

Ocean couldn't do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You asked
For clear skies â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I gave you
The darkest blue â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You wanted sunshine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I gave you the moon â™ª</i>
