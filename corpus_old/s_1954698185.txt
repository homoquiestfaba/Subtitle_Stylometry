Miracle of the Heart

%%


When the call came
in I was thinking

Multiples from the accident.

No, there's just one.

My wife met a drop-dead
gorgeous girl at the office.

Why are you always
trying to fix me up?

I'm your friend.

I'm looking out for you.

You work too hard.

Well, you can't
have a relationship

And this job at the same time.

Works for me.

Well, let's go,
William, duty calls.

All right, let's
get him into x-Ray.

Let's go, let's go.

This kid got a name?

Sean Addison, 19 years old.

Two-car collision
on the interstate.

X-rays?

Both legs are broken.

His pelvis is fractured.

But he's awake and responding --

His ultrasound is positive,
his abdomen's pretty tight,

He's a tough kid.

I'm worried about that
internal bleeding.

Hey, how you doing?

That's a dumb question.

Doc, it's real
important to my mom

That I get home
in time for Christmas.

Let's do this: Let's get
you home for Christmas.

Anesthesiologist:
Okay, Sean,

I want you to start counting
back from ten for me.

Ten, nine, eight...

Get him protamine.

Damn it!

I need to get a clamp
on the iliac to grab it.

It's okay, it's okay.

It's not okay.

Come on, Sean,
c'mon, hang in there.

More surgicel and gelfoam.

We need a sponge.

We're losing volume,
we need pressure.

Get two units of blood.

The bleeding's out of control!

We are losing pressure.

Come on, Sean, come
on, hang in there.

We're losing him,
we're losing pressure!

Sponge.

Nurse:
Doctor?

Doctor!

Come on, Sean, come on.

Damn it!

Nathan?

Nathan?

Nathan!

(water running)

You did everything
you could, we all did.

I can't do this anymore.

It's not your fault.

I blew it.

Look, every surgeon
has gone through

What you're going through.

I lost him.

Things go wrong,
things beyond our control.

You don't understand,

I promised this kid I'd have
him home for Christmas.

I understand there's
a family sitting out there

We have to help through this.

I lost him.

Give me your wallet.

Whoa!

Hey, dad.

What are you doing here?

I'm just taking a few weeks
off from the hospital.

You're on vacation?

Well, I'm a little burnt out,
but yeah, sure, I'm on vacation.

Wilsonville's not my
idea of a vacation,

But, you know,
whatever turns your crank.

What, can't a guy take some time
off and bond with the old man?

Bond?

Are you feeling all right?

Shoes...They would be...

Ah.


Man on CD:
<i>Como esta usted.</i>

Como esta usted.

Como esta usted?

Como esta usted?

<i>Yo estoy bien.</i>

Yo estoy bien.

Yo estoy bien.

Yo estoy bien.

<i>Mui bien.</i>

Aww...

(Spanish continues indistinct)


Ah, disculpe.

Trabajas tu aqui?

Eschuche me.

Eschucha me?

Trabajas tu aqui?

I'm sorry, I don't
speak...I wish I did.

I really wish I did.

I got it, I got it,
I got it dad.

I got it, I got it.

Can I...

Ah, si, si, si.

These books are a mess.

Let me see the Bill, Jack.

You're family, I'm not
going to charge you.

I just want to see it.

It's in here somewhere --
I'll stick it in the mail.

I know this lady
at church, Lydia.

Smart as a whip!

She's got half
the businesses in town online.

Nice lady.

Lost her husband about six years
ago, sings in the church choir.

I'll call her.

Okay, okay.

(Spanish on CD player)

Como se llamo usted?

Me llamo Meghan.

Hey, ma'am, you just picked up
a nail, but you're good to go.

Yo pienso tengo un poco dinero?

No, no, no money.

No dinero.

Just come back as a future
customer, that's good enough.

Bueno.

(car starts)

You're cute, Mr. Mechanic.

Muchas gracias!

Well, I'll be.

Hi, grandma.

Don't call me that.

What are you doing here?

I'm just taking
a little time off.

Well, don't take
too much time off.

When I need my coronary
bypass I want you to operate.

The older you get, the more
you remind me of your mother.

We just lost one of our

After-school
playground volunteers

Over at
the elementary school.

Oh, sorry, I'm just
here on vacation.

So, when you're on vacation,

That means you can't
help little kids?

I'll call the school
and tell them to expect you.

And don't be late.

Yes, ma'am.

Dad, have you seen
mom's Christmas shoes?

What?

Her red shoes, I've looked
everywhere for them.

They're on the top
shelf in the closet.

I checked there.

Son, I don't know.

Well, think!

Aw, jeez.

What?

They might have got mixed in
with some stuff I donated.

Going to the church.

Damn it!

Man: I already signed you
up, so you're all set.

Are we still going to move
to Alaska and go fishing?

As soon as I save up the money.

(bell rings)

Dad, will you walk
me to my class?

I got work to do.

Please?

Hey, don't screw around
after school, okay?

We're lucky to get
a couple of jobs

After only being
here for a week.

I need your help today.

Two blocks down this street --
big gray house on the corner.

Okay.

Feeling all right?

Yeah.

Now that I have
everyone's attention,

We're going to play a game.

The game is called spotlight,

And today in
the spotlight we have...

Hola mejor Jose,

O, Clara, no.

Va hacer Charlie Bennett.

Stand up, Charlie.

Charlie is new to
the school and the community,

So, tell us a little bit
about yourself, Charlie.

Where did you live before
you came to Wilsonville?

Well, my dad and I moved
here from Rockville,

And before that we were
in Silver Spring, Maryland,

Before that, Indiana.

My dad works on big estates
so that's why we move a lot.

Hey dork, there's no
estates in Wilsonville.

Okay, buddy, that's enough.

Very good, Charlie.

Sasha, could you flip
the lights for me?

Now, who can tell me
what cinco de mayo means?

Cinco de may-o is
Mexican mayonnaise.

(class laughs)

Okay, uh, Charlie.

Mexico's independence.

Exactly right, Charlie.

It's actually one of
the biggest holidays in Mexico,

And speaking of the holidays,

We all know that the holidays
are about family and friends,

So, I want you all
to start thinking about

Writing a paper on
someone who's important to you,

Someone special.

Maybe even a family member,

And don't forget it's
due on December 15.

(bell rings)

Okay, gracias, everybody.

Class:
Gracias.

Marty James got the chicken
pox, so we're one man down.

So what do we want to do?

I can take both of these guys.

No, you have to play
two on two.

How can...

Hey, what's your name?

Charlie.

Charlie, do you want to play?

We're a man down.

Sure.

All right, it's you
two against you two.

Buddy, you're first.

All right, here we go,
two on two.

(whistle blows)

Whoa, steal!

Nicely done.

(boys chattering)

Oh, well done!

Very good.

All right, let's see
you do that again.

It's not gonna happen again.

Oh, between the legs he goes!

Very nice!

We got a player here.

Very good!

You should play
with us more often,

You could really whip
these guys into shape.

I gotta go.

Well, think about it,
Charlie, you're really good.

Emily, look at you!

You are getting so big.

If you ever need
me to baby-sit...

I'd love that, but Emily
hasn't been feeling well.

Oh, sweetheart.

Well, you just
let me know, okay?

Bye, hon.

Bye.

Are you...

Hey, are you all right?

Did you hurt your --

Oh, hey you --

Slowly:
Hola, me llamo Nathan.

Let's cut the Spanish, okay?

I'm in pain now.

I was just practicing
on you this morning.

It's my first semester here,

I was teaching
a section on Mexico.

Mui bien.


So you were at the garage this
morning, and now you're here.

What's going on?

I'm stalking you.

No, no, I'm a volunteer here.

I was just playing basketball
with the kids earlier.

Your ankle feels okay.

That's because you're
holding the wrong one.

Right.

Meghan:
I can't believe I tripped.

This one.

Looks like it's
just like a sprain.

You might want to ice
it ten, 15 minutes,

Three or four times a day.

Instead of ice you can use
frozen peas or corn works well.

An ace bandage, too --

Wrap it up and keep it
elevated if you can.

Where did you learn all that?

Uh, I took a couple first aid
classes this Summer.

You know, lifeguard and stuff.

So you fix tires in the morning,

A playground monitor
in the afternoon

With a little sidewalk
first aid thrown into the mix.

Am I overlooking anything?

No, that's pretty much me.

Well, okay.

Send me a Bill for the flat tire
and the ankle, all right?

Hey, no charge.

Thanks.

What's with the shirt?

Uh, see that little
house over there?

Some of the other teachers
and moms and I

Decided to start a fundraiser
so that we could buy it

And turn it into
a daycare center.

We're doing a benefit
Christmas Eve.

Nice.

I gotta get going,
I'm late for training.

Nathan:
Training?

What training?

Cross country.

I'm a runner, six Miles a day.

Once a jock, always a jock.

Well, you shouldn't train
today, not with that ankle.

Are you kidding?

Haven't you ever heard
the expression, "no pain --

-- No gain," I know.

But still --

It's kind of a metaphor
for life, don't you think?

Well, okay, if you're not going
to take my ankle advice

Then you're going to have
to pay for the tire.

Okay, what do I owe you?

Call me at the garage,
maybe we can have dinner.

(children playing)

Hey Charlie, it's Nathan.

You need some help?

Yeah, sure.

Too bad you had to
leave the game so early.

Yeah, well, my dad needed me.

We're a team.

Nice place.

My dad and I don't live
here, we just work here.

When I was a kid we used
to take all the leaves,

Put them in a gigantic pile,

I'd hide inside
and our dog would go run,

Jump in the middle
and try to find me.

I never had a dog.

Does your mom work, too?

I don't have a mom.

I don't have a mom, either.

She died when
I was about your age.

I remember some things
about my mom, but not a lot.

She left when I was little,
to be an actress in Hollywood.

An actress, wow.

At least, that's
what my dad said.

I hate not having a mom.

Nathan:
Ah!

Look at this.

Aww!

Charlie.

Oh, hey, dad.

We were just... playing.

Sorry, it's my fault.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Nathan Andrews.

I'm volunteering
at the school,

Just playing hoops
with the kids.

My first week.

This isn't a playground,
it's what we do for a living.

I --

See you at school, Charlie.

(car starts)

What the hell were you
doing playing basketball?

Charlie:
It's fun, dad.

Why can't I once in a while?

I mean, I'll be
careful, I promise.

The coach said I was a natural.

Coach?

He's not a coach.

What does he know?

He knows I'm good.

That right?

Wow, thanks, dad!

Perfect.

The shoes are gone.

I'm sorry, son.

I know it was a long time ago,
but I can't help it, you know?

I was attached to them.

I know.

Dad.

I don't think I'm going
to be a doctor anymore.

What?

Nathan:
It's not for me.

I mean, there are other
things to do in life.

What, like be a mechanic?

What's wrong with
being a mechanic?

You're a mechanic.

Yeah, but if I was smart
enough to be a doctor,

I'd be a doctor, Nathan.

I don't know, I just --

Oh, wait a minute,
what are you saying?

You think you're gonna
move back in here with me?

Is that it?

Why not?

Son, I'm planning
on selling the house.

What are you talking about?

I'm getting restless
here, I need a change.

Dad, you can't -- no!

You can't do that.

What do you mean, no?

I mean, it's okay for you to
make a change in your life

But not me, is that
what you're saying?

Dad, I grew up in this house.

(country western music playing)


Okay, where are we?

I take all the girls I'm trying
to seduce to this very place.

Really?

Yeah.

Brave of you.

It sounds like a good choice.

Well, if you can't
bring the girl to Texas,

Bring Texas to the girl.

Wow.

Right?

I had no idea
this place was here.

Oh, yeah, I'm full of surprises.

Cheers.

(glasses clink)

So how'd a Texas girl
end up in new England?

Oh...Cowboys.

Let's just say
I took a bad fall.

Tex loved NASCAR, rodeo,
and Pat Conroy --

Deadly combination in my book.

I thought he was
the only guy for me,

And he fooled me into thinking
I was the only girl for him.

So, when I picked myself up,

I thought it would be a good
time to go someplace else.

What about you?

Yeah, there was one.

Rachel.

We fought like cats and dogs but
we were crazy about each other,

Talked about marriage
the whole year.

We actually planned
on running away together.

The day came, we gathered
up all our clothes

And what little money
we had in a dirty sock,

And then our moms caught us
and we got grounded.

What was this, fifth grade?

Fourth grade, yeah.

Oh, okay.

So nothing serious since Rachel?

My mom always said you don't
look for the right person,

You...Discover each other.

%% on Friday night when
I see her out %%

%% even in a crowd %%

%% she's hard to miss %%

%% there ain't
a man breathing air %%

%% who wouldn't stop and stare %%

%% and the best part is %%

%% she doesn't know
she's got it %%

%% she doesn't know

%% she doesn't know
she's got it %%

%% and that's
what's getting me %%

You must be proud of yourself,
building up a business.

What?

What'd you say, Lydia?

I said, you must be
proud of yourself,

Building up a business.

Oh, yeah, it's
only a garage, so...

It's yours.

Reflects your hard work.

A lot of men couldn't have
accomplished what you have.

Well, I'm not the most organized
guy in the world, so good luck.

That's okay, at least you have
a computer, that's a start.

Yeah, that was from my son.

It was a few years ago.

He says I need to upgrade?

Oh, I think I'll start
with what you have

And we'll go from there.

Good, you do that.

Answering machine: <i>Nathan,</i>
<i>John Wilson at the bank.</i>

<i>We are processing</i>
<i>the home loan application,</i>

<i>Shouldn't be a problem, but</i>
<i>call if you have any questions.</i>


<i>Nathan, this is Dr. Goetz.</i>

<i>William and the rest of</i>
<i>the team said to tell you</i>

<i>We sure could use some good</i>
<i>help around here --</i>

(voice cuts off)

So you think I'm nuts to want
to buy the house I grew up in?

Mmm, I moved around
so much as a kid,

There's not one of the houses
I'd ever want to go back to.

My mom died in that house.

So...Your plan is to live in
the house that you grew up in

The rest of your life,
and die in it like your mom did?

The house has memories.

Mmm, houses don't have memories.

People have memories.

Come on.

So, right now, it's
just an empty house,

But after we buy this place,

I'm going to bring in
all kinds of furniture:

A fridge, a microwave,
a new stove.

Upstairs, we're going
to have all kinds of,

You know, beds and cribs
for the children to nap in,

And then in the backyard

We're going to have
a swing set with slides --

Everything you need to open
up a daycare center,

And I love that it's across
the street from the school.

Whenever a single mom has a job,

She'll know that there's a safe
place she can leave her kids.

If anyone can do it.

You know what else?

I'd like to get every
doctor in town

To donate just an hour
or so every month.

Most of the women that would
come to a place like this

Would be just like my mom:
No health insurance,

Working two and three
jobs, no husband,

Always worried about leaving
their kids somewhere.

Can I be the first
person to volunteer?

I'm an expert plumber.

You're hired.

I can also probably get
a couple doctors to volunteer.

Another round?

Why not?

Here you go.

Old friend?

Yeah.

Wife.

Ex-wife.

Dad.

All right.

I was just leaving.

You came here just in time.

Wow, Christmas lights.

I love Christmas.

Your mother left
us on Christmas,

That always left
a bad taste in my mouth.

Last year you said
she left us on Easter,

Right before the resurrection.

Well, it was a holiday,
I remember that.

You know, she's probably
dancing on Broadway

Right this very minute.

Oh, come on, dad.

You're always making stuff up.

Like what?

One time you said
she was an artist

And she ran away
to Italy to paint.

Another time you said
she was in a country band,

And then another time you said
she was an actress in Hollywood.

Well, she's been
gone a long time.

She's done all that stuff.

What, you think I'm
making all this stuff up?

Okay, all right,
Mr. Smart guy.

She was a dancer.

These belonged to your mother.

Wow, man.

Nathan?

Hey.

What's up?

Rita's having trouble
getting her car to start.

Could you look at it?

Sure.

Whatever it costs,
I'll cover it.

Okay.

Thank you so much,
I really appreciate this.

No problem.

So, what do you think
the problem is?

Just a loose spark
plug wire, she's lucky.

Could you take
a look at the baby?

Rita doesn't have
health insurance.

Nathan, anything you can do.

Meghan, I'm a mechanic.

Do you know how much
trouble I could get in

Trying to diagnose a baby?

I've taken a few
first aid classes.

Nathan, please?

Meghan, I --

Please?

Come on.

All right.

(baby cries)

Thank you.

Hi, do you mind if --

She won't stop crying.

I can see.

Hi, hey little one.

Aww, you're okay.

Hi, hi, I know.

Is she going to be okay?

Yeah, okay, oh...

Yeah, I think she's
a little colicky.

Maybe it's her diet.

Milk allergy?

Let me give you the number
of a doctor friend of mine.

His name's William, and
he'll take care of your baby.

Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

Nathan, would you
give me a lift home?

Sure.

Oh, I know.

Baby, don't cry.

Bye, sweetheart.

I love you.

Oh, thank you.

Rita was my mom
and I was that little girl.

Thanks.

What?

Who are you?

What does that mean?

You're one of
the good guys, aren't you?

Meghan, you can't
do that anymore.

I can't give out medical advice.

But you're good at it.

I'm good at lots of things.

Really?

Prove it.

Where is this guy?

Meghan: He'll be here,
he's a good guy.

Man: I need the environmental
impact report.

I need it not the day after
tomorrow, not tomorrow,

I need it today, now.

There he is.

I know, Mr. Layton,
but I'm having --

Look, this is an honest,
small-time businessman,

And this environmental lobby's

Trying to shut him down
any way that they can.

And he doesn't have 20 lawyers

Like all the bad guys do,
he's got us.

We're it.

I know, Mr. Layton.

I'm just having a problem
getting the reports from --

You know, you need to
get beyond the problem,

That's why you're here.

That's why you
became an attorney.

And if you have
a problem with that,

Then maybe you ought to
find a different career.

You think that guy's going
to donate to your cause?

Forget it.

Nathan, please.

I need all the help I can get.

If I don't get a down payment
by the end of the month

Then I lose the option
on the house

And there goes
the daycare center.

Excuse me.

Meghan.

Hi, Robert.

Hey.

Hi, Nathan Andrews.

Robert.

She's going to be
a good attorney one day,

She just doesn't know it yet.

This is a list of people
I've contacted

Who are willing to contribute.

Oh, Robert.

Thank you.

It's a great idea,
we need to find more ways

To contribute back
to the community.

Well, you wouldn't by
any Chance know someone

Who would want to help
administer this program?

There's legal
and administrative issues.

Well, I'd love to help,

But I think you should
talk to Julian Haymer

At legal aid society.

I've talked to him;
he's willing to help out.

Great!

Again, thank you.

You bet.

It's nice meeting you.

You, too.

Well, you're a great
judge of human nature.

Hey, would you come
out here a minute?

I need your advice.

You know, Lydia,

I was thinking about your idea.

Yeah, well like you
said, it's been 18 years.

Time for re-roofing
and repainting, right?

Yeah.

Nathan:
Dad.

There's got to be a better way.

What are you talking about?

You're using
20th century equipment

On 21st century technology;
it's inefficient.

You're the one that
went through college,

I mean, you're telling me
you can't figure this out?

You want me to do it?

No, I can do it,
it's just going to take

Two or three times
longer than it should.

You really need to invest
in some new equipment.

It would pay off for you,
for both of us.

I think Nathan's right, Jack.

It will increase
the value of the business.


And so, I can afford this?

Sure.

Then, we'll see.

Your son is very handsome.

Jack:
Takes after his mom.

I think he's got
a lot of you in him,

Especially through the eyes.

So, Nathan must have been pretty
young when he lost his mother.

He was about ten,
it's tough on him.

Tough on both of you.

And, of course,
after a few years,

People think you
ought to be over it,

Get on with your life, right?

What do they know?

I could be in line
at the post office

Or at the grocery store
or in church,

And I'd just start
bawling like a baby.

Felt pretty stupid sometimes.

Well, you couldn't help it.

Unless you've been through it.

That's right, you got
no idea what it's like.

Yeah, and you never get over
losing someone like that, never.

It feels like yesterday.

I know exactly what you mean.

Do you date at all, Jack?

No.

Well, I mean, I have off
and on over the years,

But I haven't given it
much thought lately.

I have.

Well, just a little.

Hey, what are you doing?

Toss those bags in the truck.

Hey dad, how long have
you had the dancing shoes?

I don't know, a long time.

How come you've never
shown them to me before?

Well, maybe I lost them,
or maybe I couldn't find them.

Could have told me about them.

Tucker:
What would you have done?

You'd drive me
nuts, that's what.

Hey, if you don't want
them, I'll get rid of them.

No, no, I want them.

Did mom take dancing
lessons when she was little?

How'd she get so good?

You know what kind
of dancing she does?

Charlie, what do you think
I am, a damn encyclopedia?

Dad?

What?

You have any idea how
good she was at dancing?

Charlie, why don't you
just maybe sit down

And do some homework
or something, okay?

All right, let's beat
these bums, come on.

Nice, nice.

Charlie?

Charlie?

Charlie!

Charlie, talk to me!

Nathan, what is it?

What's wrong with him?

Oh, my God.

What happened?

Go get help, hurry.

Call 911.

We've got to get him
to new England general.

Guys, give him some room.

Back up, please?

Hang in there, buddy.

Stay with me.

Meghan: Why did we have to bring
him all the way to Burlington?

What's happened to him, Nathan?

What's going on?

Good to see you again.

His father's on his way.

His 02 levels are up.

Right, right.

His aorta's enlarged,
Marfan syndrome.

This boy had his chest
opened when he was three.

They sewed in a graft but
the repair was never perfect.

It's gotten considerably worse.

Excuse me, but, what's
wrong with Charlie?

How does a healthy
ten-year-old boy

Go from playing
basketball to the ICU?

Charlie's not healthy.

He's got a cardio condition that
could have major consequences.

Yeah, his heart, Meghan,
it's -- it's failing.

Well, can you fix it?

I mean, can you do something?

We've put him on some new
medication that may sustain him.

It's our only hope, he's
not a transplant candidate.

I hope this means
you're back, doctor.

Hey.

How's Charlie?

I just got back
from the hospital.

His medication is working, he
should be home in a few days.

Good.

How are you?

I must be coming
down with something.

Maybe disappointment.

Look, Meghan, I didn't
mean to deceive you.

Then what were you doing?

Because you sure
could have fooled me.

I just didn't want
everyone in town

Knowing that I'd
left the hospital.

What do you think
everyone's thinking

When they see you working
at the garage, Nathan?

Hello?

I don't know --

Don't be dishonest with me.

Look --

I had my fill of that in
Texas, I don't want it again.

I am not being
dishonest with you.

I'm not.

No, you just didn't tell
me what you've spent

The last 12 years
of your life doing.

Nathan, figure out what's
holding you back in life,

Let it go, and move on.

And don't lie to me!

Woman's voice:
"dear Nathan,

How excited you must be on
your high school graduation.

I wish I could have been there.

I bet you looked so handsome
in your cap and gown.

Right now, you're probably
trying to figure out

What to do in life.

I did, too.

I loved music.

I was so grateful when I was
chosen to lead the youth choir

In the annual Christmas show.

What a surprise!

What fun!

If I could say anything to you,

I would say to do
what you love to do.

To be happy in your
work is a blessing.

All my love, mom."

Hey dad, remember those letters
mom wrote to me before she died?

I forgot that she
was thinking about

Being a music major in college.

Man, she could do anything.

Hey, some of that new
equipment is coming in, huh?

Oh hey, and here she talks about
the first time she met you.

I don't want to talk about it.

Nathan: You guys had
your picture taken together

At some county fair?

Are you listening to me?

Am I getting through?

Dad --

Look, every damn holiday,
every damn vacation

You come home from school

And we drag out the pictures,
drag out the letters,

Talk about mom, cry about mom.

It makes me feel
good to talk about her.

Well maybe it makes you feel
good, but then you'd leave.

For the next month I'm walking
around with my guts hanging out.

I can't live like that
year after year, I can't.

So, what are we supposed to do,
pretend mom never existed?

Is that what you want?

No, I need to live
like she's gone.

Well, I don't.


Why are you really here?

What do you mean, why?

I told you, I don't want
to be a doctor anymore.

Baloney.

You ate, drank,
and slept that stuff

And now suddenly you
change your mind?

I just wanted to
come home for a bit.

Your senior year of high school,

You said you couldn't wait
to get out of this house,

This dumpy little town.

Yeah, well, maybe I've grown up.

Or maybe you haven't,
maybe that's your problem.

Hey, dad, are we going to have
Christmas lights at our place?

Probably not.

Why not?

I already told you,

I get a bad taste in my mouth
when it comes to Christmas.

Hey, dad --

Charlie, look.

In case you haven't noticed,
we're trying to work here.

Hey, dad, how tall was mom?

Don't you have some
homework to do?

How many school
days did you miss?

This is my homework.

I have to write
a report about mom.

Now, how tall is she exactly?

Five foot five.

Brown eyes, right?

When I first met your mom,

She was a waitress at
a truck stop outside Cincinnati.

Yeah, she had the most beautiful
brown eyes I'd ever seen.

She could make me laugh,
like nobody I'd ever met.

She had big dreams,
way bigger than mine.

I figured out pretty quick that
I couldn't live without her,

So we took off,
just the two of us, got married.

Well, what kind
of dancer is she?

I don't remember.

You don't remember?

Didn't you ever watch her?

I mean, what did it look
like when she danced?

Did she have a costume,
or did she dance alone,

Or with a bunch
of other dancers?

Do you know the name of
the kind of dancing she did?

Fred something or other,
I think.

That's all I remember.

Fred?

Who's Fred?

The dancer guy!

Why don't you ask your teachers?

Why I pay all
the damn taxes I do.

Fred...Something.

%% was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay %%

%% in fields where they lay
keeping their sheep... %%

(doorbell rings)

Charlie, what are you
doing out so late?

My dad said it was okay.

All right, come in.

Megan: It sure is good to
see you up and about,

Looking so good.

Miss Sullivan,
I kinda had a question.

Okay, let me just turn this off.

Running is hard.

To do anything well is hard.

Come on, let's sit.

So, did you come here
for some math help?

Um, I was working on
the report about my mom,

And she's a dancer.

Ooh, a dancer.

What kind of dancer?

That's what I came
here to ask you.

All my dad said
was Fred something.

Fred Astaire?

You know him, this Fred guy?

Well, I don't know him,

But I know the kind of dancing
that your mom does.

Could you show me?

Um...Well...

Charlie:
Please?

Okay, I'm not very good,

But I've seen a lot
of the old movies.

It's very elegant and romantic.

The men get all dressed up,
usually in their tuxedos,

And the women, they wear these
beautiful dresses and shoes

And they kind of glide
across the dance floor,

Staring into one another's eyes.

Hey, coach, what
are you doing here?

Oh, I was just going
to visit your teacher.

Meghan's a good friend of mine.

My teacher sure
can dance, coach.

She sure can.

Charlie, you need a ride home?

Okay.

Thanks.

So, Charlie, you've been
sick a long time, huh?

As long as I can remember.

Been to a lot of doctors?

Yeah, my dad's taken me to
about a thousand of them.

You remember to
take your medicine?

Yeah.

You sure?

Because I've been thinking
of a way you can remember.

We could tattoo it
on your forehead,

Or we can get some of the girls
at your school to remind you.

No, coach, I promise
I remember.

Okay?

Honest.

All right, because it's
really important that you do.

And sorry,
but no more basketball.

Coach, remember how I
said my mom was a dancer?

Yeah.

Look.

These are her dancing shoes.

Where...

Coach, are you okay?

Yeah, I just...My mom had
a pair of shoes just like this.

Thanks for the ride.

Later.

Stay after those pledges.

Can't stop now, we have too many
moms and kids depending on us.

Okay, Meghan.

We can do this.

We've got three weeks
'til the benefit.

All right, see ya.

Bye.

Hey.

Hey.

You got a minute?

Can we talk?

Sure.

I know this is going to sound
nuts, but when I was a kid,

I bought this pair of red shoes
for my mother, on Christmas Eve,

The night she died, and for
years I hadn't seen them,

And in fact I thought
they were lost,

But somehow Charlie
has found them.

You think I'm crazy, don't you?

No, not really.

Well, just a little bit.

So, Charlie has
a pair of red shoes

That once belonged
to your mother.

What's going on, Nathan?

Is this about losing
a pair of shoes?

The day I walked
out of the hospital,

I lost a teenage kid
on the operating table.

When I was looking down on him,

This wave swept over me
and I was ten years old again,

And afraid -- afraid of losing
someone else, you know?

Afraid of losing my dad.

So --

So, that's why you moved
back into the house.

Yeah, so we could be together.

I can't shake that
feeling of losing him.

You're not going to lose
your dad, Nathan, okay?

And you're stuck with me.

I just think sometimes I'm
too tough on him, you know?

I mean, a man wants to
do right by his kids,

But...Gosh, sometimes you just
don't know what right is.

Yeah, I'm thinking of
selling my business.

My son's not going to like it.

How old's your boy?

He's late twenties.

He's a good kid,
he's confused maybe,

A little like his old man.


I don't know, maybe it's
not such a good idea.

Tucker, kind of new around here.

Jack, been here too long.

Hey, you don't mind
an opinion, do you, Jack?

No, go ahead.

Well, your kid, he's got
a whole life ahead of him,

And you don't.

Here's to fatherhood.

You don't come
here much, do you?

What makes you say that?

Well, you're one of those guys
that stares into his beer

Instead of drinking it.

It's a dead giveaway, man.

My wife died 18 years ago

And in those days I came
in all the time.

But -- I started thinking
about my boy at home

And I realized I was spending
way too much time here.

I've been lying to
my kid for years.

His mother left us and then
she was killed in a car crash.

I started making up stories
to make it easier on him,

You know, and hell, when he was
little, it worked pretty good.

But he's older now;
he's asking more questions,

And I'm running out of
stories and answers.

How about the truth?

No, I could never tell him.

I could never tell him.

Thanks.

Sure.

Christmas.

Man: I'll draw up the contract

And get the papers over for you
to sign as soon as possible.

Looking forward to
hearing from you.

You bet.

Dad, hey.

Hey!

Place looks great, huh?

Yeah, listen, I need your help.

I was a little tough
on you the other night.

No, it's fine.

The bank turned me down
for the loan on the house.

Well, you owe about a million
bucks in medical school loans,

And you're not a doctor
anymore, so it's no wonder.

Right, but they'll accept
a loan if you'll co-sign.

Well, I can't do that.

What do you mean
you can't do that?

I'm selling the garage.

A guy just left here,
he's in real estate,

And he says he can turn
the place over fast, so --

Dad, you can't sell
this place, too.

What is going on?

Son, you've got your whole life
in front of you, and I don't.

This is a great
opportunity for me.

You think this is easy?

Selling my house, my business?

Letting go
a chunk of my life?

I have to.

Lydia:
Jack?

Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah.

I just can't believe we
finished the place is all.

Yeah.

A lot of hard work, wasn't it?

Mm-hmm.

It was definitely worth it.

Lydia:
I think so.

So what are you going to do,
after you sell the place?

You know, I worked
my whole life,

And I've never really done
anything, been anywhere,

And I was thinking --

I was thinking I was
going to get an R.V.

I'm going to get an R.V.,
I'm gonna travel around,

Maybe go fishing, go to Florida.

I really appreciate
what you've done for me.

I never could have done
any of this without you.

So, you know, if you want to
send me a Bill, that's fine.

Yeah, sure.

Hey, Lydia.

Thanks.

%% don't waste your time
looking over your shoulder %%

%% those loves from the past
ain't getting no closer %%

%% when I look in my future
you're all I can see %%

%% so honey don't go
loving on nobody but me %%

%% nobody but me gonna love you

Meghan?

Whoa, whoa!

Excuse me.

Nathan.

Tell me.

Tested positive for hep b.

The liver biopsy showed
severe hepatic cirrhosis.

Viral, with irreparable damage.

Could have had it for
the last six months or so,

The symptoms mimic a bad flu.

We need to get a transplant
team involved, now.

I can't lose her,
William, I just can't.

Say, Mr. Mechanic.

Is there any Chance I can
get a new transmission?

My mama always said Christmas
was the time for miracles.

Sometimes it's tough
waiting for the Miracle.

I've got some bad news.

I told the front desk

You're not allowed to have
any visitors from Texas,

Particularly those big,
strong cowboy types.

I don't need the competition.


Tex and I didn't
want the same things.

All I wanted was commitment.

Maybe it's old-fashioned,
but it works for me.

It's funny how things
work, isn't it?

If none of that happened,
I wouldn't have left Texas,

And I wouldn't have met you.

I guess I owe Tex.

I've been reading
my mother's letters.

And?

She said, one day,
I would meet a girl

And my heart would skip a beat
when she smiled at me.

And then the day would
come when I realized

I couldn't live without her.

And she was right.

Hmm.

Hey, Meghan's friend, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, Nathan.

You remind me of somebody.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah, I just can't
figure out who.

I've had that happen.

How's she doing?

She's not good.

Can I go see her?

Yeah, I'm sure she'd love that.

How are you holding up?

She's really sick, and there's
nothing I can do about that.

And now this house
that she wants to buy,

The option's up
on Christmas Eve,

So that's not going to happen.

You never know
what's going to be.

See you.

Hey, how's Meghan?

What do you care?

Hey!

Nathan, come here.

I want to show you something.

Come on.

What is it?

Sometimes, when you
were at school,

And I knew I was by myself,

I'd get a little crazy
because I missed her so much,

And...

Nice, huh?

I thought about
plastering it over,

But over the years when
stupid things would annoy me,

I would come in here,
I would look at the hole,

And I would realize what
was important in life.

Yeah, well, if I never came home

I wouldn't be going through
any of this right now.

I would go through
everything --

The pain and the loss
all over again,

To hold your mother
one more minute.


Hey, Charlie boy.

How'd you get in here?

I kinda snuck in.

Thank you.

Well, sneaking in is
the best way to visit.

How's school?

I finished my paper.

It's called "mom."

You did?

Can I read it?

Yeah.

There was a fire
in your trailer?

Yeah, when I was a baby.

Sweetheart, that's terrible.

Everything got burned up,

Including all
the pictures of my mom.

You know, my mom used to say

That you learn the most about
God when times are tough.

My dad and I have had
a lot of tough times.

We must be at the top
of God's list, huh?


Yeah, and you are right at the
top of my list, that's for sure.

An a?

Wow!

Well, it's one of the best
papers I've ever read.

What's wrong with you?

I have a bad liver.

I need a new one.

Are you going to die?

Maybe.

I don't want you to die.

Charlie, look at me.

Here, come here.

The best thing you can do
for me right now

Is not to worry about me.

Take care of yourself, okay?

Okay.

Okay, here we go!

Charlie, Charlie.

A little Christmas cheer, buddy.

Dad?

I don't feel so good.

Daddy?

Hi, coach.

Hi, Mr. Three-point jump shot.

I guess I'm not
doing so good, am I?

The medication's
not working anymore.

So your heart can't work
the way it's supposed to.

What's Heaven like?

I don't know.

But I bet it's beautiful.

Do you think you can see
everything from Heaven?

You don't want to
see everything.

Garbage can, inside of a toilet.

But I bet I'll be able to see
buddy cheating at basketball,

My dad cleaning gutters.

I bet you will.

Why is God taking me?

Charlie, God isn't taking you,
he's receiving you.

I don't know why
it has to be now,

But I believe that
God must need you.

He must want you to be with him.

Maybe he needs a good outside
shooter for one of his teams.

Maybe he does.

What does your mom look like?

Well, she's not very tall,
and she has brown hair,

And blue eyes, these
dimples, and a great smile.

And she's got a great laugh,

So if you see someone up there
that looks like that,

It just might be her.

If I see her, would you like me
to tell her something for you?

Yeah.

Tell her that I still miss her,

And that I love her as much now
as I did when she was here.

Okay.

Coach?

Could you do something for me?

Sure.

I'd like my teacher
to have these.

You got it.

Charlie:
Hi, dad.

Hi.

I guess I'm not going
to make it to Alaska.

Alaska's not all it's
cracked up to be.

It's too damn cold
up there, anyway.

I know it's not
Christmas yet, but...

Here, let me help you.

Charlie?

It's your mom.

I just saw her, dad.

I just saw her.

I think mom is where I'm going.

She was dancing,
dad, she was dancing.

Look, you just rest, okay?

Because I've got this
little job to do,

And I'll be back later.

Dad?

Could you stay?

Just this one time?

Yeah, sure, I can stay.

My coach says you can see
everything from Heaven.

When you go to Alaska,
could you pick salmon for me?

Yeah, sure.

My teacher's real sick.

Yeah, I know.

Dad, I want you to
promise me something.

Anything, son.

Anything you want.

Hey.

Hey.

So I guess you got that
transmission after all.

Why did it have to be Charlie?

I don't know,
Meghan, I don't know.

But the important
thing is, you're alive,

And Charlie was
a big part of that.

You helped him
through, didn't you?

Of course.

And he helped me through.

Oh, he wanted you to have these.

They belonged to his
mother, and my mother,

And now they belong to you.

I love you so much.

Nathan, thanks for coming.

Yeah, not a problem.

Sit.

Listen, a long time ago,
years, I was a jerk.

All I cared about was my work, I
spent no time with my daughter,

Marriage was on the rocks --

Mr. Layton,
I'm not sure I should --

And on Christmas Eve
I met a little boy

At Wilson's department store

Who was trying to buy
a pair of shoes for his mom.

Thanks, mister.

My God.

That night changed my life.

If it hadn't been for you,

I never would have been able
to buy my mom that present.

I guess we were both
meant to be there.

Tell Meghan not to worry
about the kids' house.

Who'd have thought
a pair of shoes

Can change people's lives?

Thank you.

Nathan.

You're doing great.

Your mom would be proud.

(phone dialing)

(phone ringing)

Lydia:
<i>Hello?</i>

Hi, it's Jack.

<i>Oh, hi Jack.</i>

Listen, there's a fundraiser
tonight in the town square

With some sort of surprise guest
or surprise something,

And I was wondering,
if you're not busy,

That maybe you
could meet me there.

A little.

Hey, you ever been to Florida?

No, but I'd like to.

Joe, thanks for making
the call to Nashville.

I feel so thankful.

Yeah, me too.

Hey, I'm going to go back
into the hospital -- pediatrics.

Nathan!

And, there's something else.

A little early
Christmas present.

The house.

Robert bought the kids' house.

%% ... God will see us through %%

Thank you.

Merry Christmas, everyone.

We have a surprise

All the way from
Nashville, Tennessee.

Would you make
welcome Blake Shelton.

Merry Christmas,
Blake, we love you!

Thank you, thank you.

A new song, everybody.

Let's hear it for them.

I also want to send out a
special thanks to Robert Layton,

Who put all this
together for us tonight.

Thank you, Robert.

You know, there's one person
who probably understands

More why we're here tonight
more than anyone else.

Meghan?

Is Meghan out there?

Meghan?

She's right here.


Thank you, thank you
so much for coming.

Tonight is about raising
money for the kids' house.

I would like to rename the
kids' house "Charlie's House,"

In honor of a very
special little boy.

Charlie wasn't in this town for
very long, but he touched lives.

I know he touched mine.

He gave me my life back.

Charlie, I love you.

Blake?
