Party Boat! Party Boat!

Attention,
Lake Everett Seniors!

Let's get wild! Let's get weird!
But let's not get pregnant!

Party Boat! Party Boat!

Come on! Ha ha!

Hey, you!
Oh, man.

Promise me
no one dies tonight!

Listen. We are
five years in, my man.

Nobody's died yet.
That we know of.

If no one dies
on my last night,

I'm gonna be real disappointed.

You've been threatening to quit

for three seasons now, Kiley.

I don't think
it's gonna happen.

Hey. Did you guys go
to our school?

No!
Yes!

Best friends since fifth grade.

Fourth! Fourth.

We are living proof

that with a little bit of hustle
and some luck...

And a predatory loan.

All your dreams
can come true!

That is the best dream ever!

It is. Aim high!
Whoo!

That's what we do, Sean!
We make dreams come true! Unh.

Oh, yeah!

Whoo!

Three, two, one! Go!

That was pretty cool.
That was awesome.

Hey, guys! Look alive!

Get in there.
What the hell?

What, do you guys live here?

Oh, yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

Sad-cool, maybe?

Shut up! Do you know how
much trouble we would get into

if lake patrol boarded us
and found this stash?

It's a lot.

What kind of drugs
are those anyway?

Combination Locks.

What the hell is that?

It's Adderall mixed with molly
mixed with acid.

It's like a combo meal,
extra fries.

Kinda makes
your brain just... lock.

Hmm.
Then you're flying high!

Oh, you're flying high, huh?

Too bad we're gonna have to
confiscate them. Give me that!

What?
That's right.

You heard me right!
Get out.

No!
Back to the party, man.

Smoke some weed or something.

Those are the breaks!
Damn!

We definitely have
to take some of these.

We are definitely throwing
those in the lake.

Awww.
Immediately.

Sean.
Max.

Sean.
Max.

Sean.
Max!

Fine.

Can't waste these.

Who needs aspirin?

You really want to leave
all this behind?

Can't be afraid
to move on, Max.

But nothing's gonna change,
right?

It'll be you and me,
like always.

Always!
First mates forever!

Well, well, well.
Who is this stranger?

Ah. It's my birthday bestie!

What's up?

Maximus!

You ready to party tonight?
Absolutely!

Hey, let me see that rage face!

All right, ditch your fuzzies.
Let's go.

Yeah, but I gotta clean
the boat, so...

You never clean the boat.

I'll be right down!

Uh, did Greg get you
the final guest list?

He did.
And the wine list.

And the appetizer list.
And the playlist.

Yeah.
Hey, Kev, how we lookin'?

Clear skies. Calm waters.

Awesome.
Can't lose.

Anyway. Um. Sorry.
Dr. Greg loves his lists.

"Dr. Greg." Don't you mean
"Orthodontist Greg"?

Hey, by the way,

have you ever told him that you
actually worked on this boat?

I mean, he is your boyfriend.

Uh... Yes. Yes. Obviously.
Hmm.

He doesn't know all the stories.
Oh!

Because he would run scared

if he knew all the shit
I got up to with you guys.

Well, then let's call him...
No, absolutely not!

Seriously! Sailor's code, dude!

All right, let's go.

Cool, yeah, no, I'll just...
clean up everything, as always.

Thanks, dude!

Tonight, Sean.

I'll have you in handcuffs.

Not "soon."

Tonight, Sean,

and your little dog too
are going down.

You know, Sean...

What?

What? For the love of God!

Every time!

Hey, buddy!
How's it going, Walsh?

It's all right.
My god.

This is janky.
You wanted to see me?

I did. Lock that door,
would you?

There's two locks. Lock both.
One's a bolt.

The other one's in the
door handle right there itself.

Just... we wanna be
snug as a bug... in two rugs.

How long you been
on the force, Hicks?

You mean lake patrol?

Three days.

You know, most partners
only last one week with me.

What happens to them?
They tap out.

Choke's a choke.
HR gets involved.

It's, it's better to just
cut 'em loose than go to trial.

What brought you, uh, to LALP?

You love the lake?
Search for justice?

Craigslist.

Craig's a good guy.
Tell him I said hi, okay?

It's a website.

Do you live here?

No. Live here? No.

I got a big house. No.

There's a bed. There's, like,
drool stains on the pillow.

'Cause I was sound asleep.

You take a lot of all-nighters
that you gotta pull here.

A lot of surveillance work. You
could take a nap if you want.

You're probably tired,
out in the sun all day.

I'll lay with you
if you're frightened.

I'm good.
Okay.

Why is your pans all crusty?
You cook here?

Yes, I cook.
I cook quesadillas.

I cook mean quesadillas.

You can have a quesadilla.
I'll cook one for ya.

I'll clean the pot first.
And the pan.

And then you probably
can sleep here.

You can lay down and take a nap.
I'll lay with you

in case you get frightened.
I'm good.

Is that piss?

You can go if you want.
It's all right.

It's just two dudes.
It's all right.

It's totally normal.

What's-what's that bucket for?
That's composting.

You don't wanna go near that...
Ugh!

That's shit!

You take the feces
of other animals

for the benefit of a garden.

You know what? Yes!
I live here. Okay?

And I'm proud of it.
You know why I live here?

'Cause of that white boat.
And these two assholes...

Well, he's an asshole.
He's kinda handsome in a cool...

They think they run the lake.
But they don't run that lake.

Hicks, I run that lake.

But you wanna know
what this is right here?

This is my golden ticket
for that white boat.

This is the Lake Council
telling me

I have full authority
to bring those assholes

and burn 'em
to the ground, tonight!

So if you're in,
if you're down with the job,

cop a squat, take a leak,

drain the train,
have a quesadilla,

take a nap, I'll lay
with you if you want,

because tonight, we roll.

Let's go buzz their tower!

Okay.

Hey, wait, wait!

Slow down, white lightening!

Wait, Kiles, hold on!

Hold on.
Sad, Max.

Yeah, I know.

Oh!

Oh, please, come on.

It's not like Dr. Supercuts
can keep up with you either?

Greg ran track at Trinity.

Of course he did.

Dude...

I really need you guys to be
friends if this is gonna work.

I need to be friends
with that guy

like you need to adopt
more puppies.

Don't talk smack about my pups.

I'm ride or die
for those bitches.

You really serious
about this whole thing?

I don't know. Sometimes
it feels like I'm faking it.

Running a shelter.

I guess I wish
I could be back on the boat

mixing drinks with you guys.

Well... I know a guy
who can make that happen.

But I was actually talking
about you and Greg.

He is the sweetest, most
supportive guy I've ever met.

I think I found someone
really special.

Ah.

Can you just try to be nice?

Please? At least for tonight?

Yeah.

Fine.

But... only because...

Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. You're so gross.

...I love you so much.

Gross. Gross.
Gross. Gross. Gross.

Oh, God, get off.
Let's go.

God, you sweat
like Trump's ball sack.

Well, yeah.

All right. One more mile.

Okay.
Try to keep up.

You're getting slow
in your old age.

You got this tonight, Sean.
This is a big party.

This is one of our biggest.
What do we got?

Smooth jazz, check.

Pinot Grigio, check.

Officers boarding vessel.
Mm-hmm.

What do you want, Walsh?

French vanilla? Creamer?
You're a pussy.

Where's your partner?

He's running errands.

Oh, really?

Ooh! Looks like
you guys are in line

for another shitshow tonight.

That's nice.
Actually, sorry to disappoint.

Tonight's a classy party,

hosted by
a locally respected doctor.

Oh, he's an orthodontist,
actually.

I don't care if it's Sean's
mom's vagina doctor.

Doesn't matter.

I've been waiting
for this moment for ten years.

This is my moment!
What moment?

What moment? I just got word
from the Lake Council

you guys haven't paid
any of your fines.

You guys are in the hole, uh...

what's the number
up to now, Hicks?

I think like
eighteen grand, sir.

Eighteen thousand dollars.

First of all... don't talk
about my mom.

Or Dr. Nancy.
Second,

we're gonna have the money.

Why do you know the name
of his mom's gynecologist?

You don't think that's odd?

How are you gonna get the money

if I ding you
with citations tonight.

If you guys screw up,
and you will screw up.

Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Not gonna happen.

Mayday!
It's not gonna happen!

Mayday.
Hey, guys,

where should I put
these fireworks?

It says it's "illegal in the
contiguous United States." Huh.

Thank God we're on a lake.

Also, I opened up the tramp...
Hey. Hey. Hey.

...for...

Why don't you go upstairs
for a second.

I think I saw a, uh, Teletubby.

Yeah, yeah, totally.

This is going to be so easy.

Come on, Hicks, let's go.

Come on. Hicks!

I freaking hate that guy.

Seanie, why have we not been
paying our bills, man?

Uh, it's the fines, Max.

The fines that your party tricks
keep sticking us with.

Me?
Yeah.

Bobbing for lobsters.
We got a fine for it.

What about the Mermaid Olympics?
Remember that? Human catapult?

That was awesome.
No, that was awesome.

That was...
that was pretty cool.

Look, man, we got into
this business together

as equal partners, man,

and I'm doing everything I can
to keep us afloat

but the fines are crushing us.

Kiley's party is
the payday we need.

So for one night,
I need you to help me, okay?

We have to keep things low-key

and we have to keep Walsh
off this boat.

All right. Fine.
I got you.

Hey, first mates forever.
Two times.

Two times. Mm.
First mates forever.

All right, cool. Checklist: Gas?

Yeah. Absolutely.

Man, you run out
of gas one time...

It was three...
Three times.

That's right. Uh, did you fix
the door on the lower deck?

Come on, man. This is Kiley
we're talking about.

You don't think
I want tonight to be perfect?

I think that I'm like this close
to getting her back on the crew.

It's been two years.
She's rescuing puppies now.

Listen, I'm gonna say this to
you as your best friend, okay?

You gotta let her go.

Hey!

Pick up a bag!

We have to be prepared

for anything when
we're out there, Hicks.

Tonight...

Look at this horse stance.
Look at this!

Anything at all, buddy.
That's why we train.

That's right, buddy.
Come on, let's train.

Nah. Calm down.

We're just lake patrol.
You know that.

Just lake patrol?

Is that what you're gonna say
when you're...

when you're out
in the shit, tonight?

"I'm lake patrol."
You gonna take a selfie?

Put it in your wifi cloud?
Is that what you're gonna do?

No.

I'll probably just tweet it.
Suit yourself,

lazy. What?

No, I'm talkin'
to Hicks there, Sean.

What?

What was that, Sean?

What was that? Hey, Max?
Wanna eat a dick?

Whoa!

Hey, Sean!

He's tall. Sean's taller.

Upwards. To the Adam's apple.

He falls towards you? Little
shoe shine on the way down.

Hey, Sean.

Ooh! Ooh!
Elbows. Right there.

Six stitches above the eye.

You ever see guys
with really cool stitches?

It's either hockey
or they caught one of my elbows.

Right there.

Why won't you just train
with me?

Honestly, I mean,

I feel like
you're gonna lose your shit

and accidentally hurt me, so.

Well, who knows? Right?

I don't accidentally
lose my temper.

Pain is a valuable,
valuable lesson.

Maybe you could use
a lesson or two.

I'll get on the boat,

I'll write some tickets...

but I don't wanna do that.

This is good footwork.
That's mat work, man.

Mat work's good for ya.

Just train. That's the problem

with your
entire generation, buddy.

Got your faces in your phones.

Palm strike. Palm strike.

Box cutter!

You're not gonna learn anything
on the internet.

That was...

Where the hell
did you learn that?

The internet.

You don't even know
what that's called, do ya?

Yelling?
Can you stretch?

Let's see you stretch.

Why don't ya go sit down
before you get hurt?

You didn't stretch!
A'ight.

Hoo!

The ancients believed that
every object had a soul.

Meet your maker!

Oh, that is sweet.

What'd I tell you
about playing with knives?

That they're awesome?
Didn't say that. Put it away.

Oh! But I am a fruit ninja!

You are a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

You better look alive tonight,

because Kiley's gonna be
on the boat,

and you are already on the verge
of being replaced, my friend.

Huh? What's that?

Ahoy, mateys!

Oh, great, the human
mouth guard has arrived.

Keep up the good work, man.
I shall. Always do.

Hey!

There they are.
The party boys.

Lookin' sharp, Greg.
I like that!

Thank you, good man. You know,
I went with the full seersuck

since we're on a boat.
Yeah.

<i>â™ª I'm on a boat â™ª</i>
No. No, no, no. Never.

Never that song.
Never on our boat.

Hey, buddy.

So we feel good?
Special night, right?

Yeah.
Yup, it is.

But why are you here
an hour early, Greg?

Dr. Greg is always early
for his appointments.

I just wanted to make sure
all our ducks are in a row.

Our ducks are in a row.
Aren't they, Sean?

They are, Max.
As a matter of fact, Greg...

We have bow ties
on all the crew.

We have smooth jazz
on all the speakers

and wine in every glass.

Trust me, Greg,
we're all over it.

Bow ties?
Uh-huh.

Jazz?
Yeah.

I thought Kiley wanted to have
her birthday on our boat

because she likes the way
that we do things,

Sean.
Kiley?

Booking the boat was my idea.

You know, for nostalgia.

I just wanted to remind her
where she came from

before showing her
where we're going.

That's amazing.
Isn't that amazing?

What does that mean?

Between us...

I'm gonna ask her
to marry me tonight.

Whoo!

You know, it feels so good
being able to say that out loud.

Wow! Our first proposal.

Big time.

Now, I'm gonna need you
to help me out

and take extra care
of my Eomma.

Jesus, Greg. You look like
an asshole in that suit.

Welcome aboard, Miss Kim.

Uh, hope you brought
your dancing shoes.

The Kims don't dance.

Now, where's the bar?

It's gonna be great.

I like your mom, Greg.

Hey. Are you serious with this?

I am. And, uh,
can you hit that top button?

No!
Yeah. Please.

How you guys doing?

Oh, hey, welcome!

So I'm thinking,
if we wanna avoid Walsh,

our best bet is
to hug the shore,

anchor down in the cove.

Yeah, we should be
in good shape.

You hearing me, Max?
Were you saying something?

Oh, hey! There she is.

Ready to get behind that bar,
birthday girl? Two times!

Unh!

You guys remember
my sister, Lauren.

Yeah, sorry about the divorce.
Tough break.

Hmm. Screw off, Max.

This boat better not sink.

That's for sure.

'Cause I'm paying
for the return trip too.

Come on, ladies,
all aboard!

Get in there!

Babe,
that suit looks great.

Hey, Max?

Hmm?

No!

Yes.
No, no...

All right. You ready?
You ready to do this?

Yeah. I'm good.
No, you're not good.

Yeah, you've got a citation
book, but you're forgetting

the number one danger
out there on that lake, man.

What's the matter
with you? The sun!

You got... the sun, 'cause the
lake reflects all the light up.

So what's this?
Uh...

weird pocket dildo?
I wish!

I don't know.
Sunscreen, buddy.

You gotta get lubed up.
I can't have you burned.

Your tattoos will look like
crumbled fresco.

It'll look like some kinda weird
Jackson Pollock, you know? Here.

So much!
Look up. Look up.

There you go. Now be still...
Oh, God.

be still, don't talk.
What are you doing?

Lubin' up.

Ooh. You... Yeah.
A lot of push-ups, I like that.

Why are you touching
my nipple like that?

I don't know, I didn't
expect it to be that long.

Sorry. Here.
Ah! God!

What the hell?
You gotta keep your eyes closed!

You're all right.
You want a nice tan line.

You got it in my eyes.

Here and I'll rub that in too.
It's okay. It's okay.

Oh!
It's okay.

I think I can't see anymore.

Let's go get those assholes.

Okay, let's go.

Look at her, man.

That is her
"I'm bored as hell

but I'm trying
to be polite" face.

Ugh, it's pathetic.

You know, Max,
it's a great thing

you and Kiley are just friends

and you're totally
not in love with her.

Otherwise, this news
of her impending engagement

would be one hell of a punch
to the nuts, huh?

I'm not "totally"
in love with her.

I guess the great part
about being just her friend

and, as you specifically noted,
nothing more,

is that you'll get to help her
choose out a wedding dress.

And when she's stressed out
about the props

in the photo booth
and her batshit mother-in-law,

you'll get to be
her totally platonic,

non-sexual shoulder to lean on.

And once she's married,
you'll get to be her confidant.

When she's worried that

Greg is no longer interested
in her sexually...

Enough!

We've just never been single
at the same time,

and I didn't want
to mess up our friendship.

Besides, I've been waiting
for the perfect moment.

You've been waiting
since fourth grade, man!

Yeah, well, there's a lot
of elements that go into

the perfect moment, Jonathan.

Trust me,

I'm the party guy.

I know a thing or two
about "moments."

Okay, well,
how about you make one!

Okay? Before Mr. Doctor Man
wifes her up?

Yeah.

Yeah.

You know what? You're right.

But I will need your help.

Sean putting us
into the cove so you...

Oh, no can do, buddy.

Not to be selfish,
but tonight is all about me,

whoever the hell that is, and
the rest of our lives together.

Don't even bother.
Lauren will swallow you whole.

That's the plan.

Hey, my name is Jonathan,

and I'm here to help you find
your smile on this voyage.

Shove that smile up your dick.

My husband screwed
his life coach

and left me with two kids
and no child support,

so pour me a goddamned whiskey.

Charming as ever, Lauren!

One sadness on rocks!

The bottle, Max.
Okay.

Twenty bucks says I take her
to the township of pound.

Yeah.

But if I don't,
I get to keep the money.

That's not how betting works.

Oh!
I know it.

Lauren?

Hey. You know we're not
actually gonna sink, right?

No, we're sinking.

We just won't know it
until it's too late.

Come on, it's not that bad.

Listen to me, Kiley.
You graduate college,

and everything's great.

You meet a guy.

And he's gorgeous
and boring and predictable

and incredibly safe.

And no one ever went wrong
with a nice guy, right?

That's wrong.

Trust me,
I know you love Greg,

but don't rush into anything.

Are you ready for this?

Are you ready?

This one is special.
I can tell.

Did you see
the-the anger in her eyes?

The hatred in her voice?

That's so hot!

She's the one, Little J.

She's the one.

We can't screw this up.

Okay, no false starts.
No second act slumps.

We need to be
on top of our game!

Now, I'm not gonna lie...

I'm nervous.

But you can't be, okay?

I need you to rise
like the sun in the east.

Looking sharp, Little J.

Looking sharp.

Yeah.

Table one, thank you.

So far so good, huh?

Yeah, if you like funerals
at sea.

Max, don't sta...

Hey, what do you guys think?

Proposal at sunset
or under the stars?

Sunset.
Stars.

All right. I trust you, Max.

Stars it is.

Sean, on my cue,
you play that song,

and I'll take care
of the rest, okay?

Yes.

I'm excited.
Yeah!

I'm nervous.
Should I be nervous?

Of course...
Yeah, have you thought this through?

Did I think this through?

I've been rehearsing this
for weeks.

Look, look. Do-Don't worry
about a thing. Okay?

Everything is set.
You're gonna do great.

Yeah, yeah.
Yeah! Come on, man!

Whoo!

That's an all right dude.

That guy's keeping TJ Maxx
in business.

No, don't do that, okay?
We need to get paid, Max.

And that only happens
if Greg walks away happy.

And that doesn't happen
if she's having a shitty time.

Look at her, man.
She's bored out of her mind!

Come on.

Dr. Greg can do
his thing later, okay?

Right now,
what we need...

is to flip this party.
No.

No, no. What about lake patrol?

You had the captain
put us in the cove.

You don't think we can handle
Chuckie Walsh?

Come on. Sean?

All right, fine. Just promise
me nobody dies tonight.

We've been doin' this
for seven years.

We haven't lost
anybody yet!

I'm serious, Max.

Shoot.

Still nothing.

Still nothing?
They just pulled into the cove.

That's gonna be the crime scene.

You just gotta be
patient, Hicks!

Why are you always
on their case, man?

Because they're the reason
I'm standing here on a dinghy

with a dinghy that looks
like Sammy Hagar's son

instead of out there throwing
detective cock all over town.

Ugh!

2007, that's when it
all changed, my man.

2007... I don't want these.

I used to break up
their high school parties.

That was me.
I was the big bad wolf.

"Here comes Officer Walsh,

everybody put
your cups down and run!"

You should have seen
the looks on their dumb faces

when I came through the woods
with my big spotlight.

Then I had to stop, I didn't
feel like doin' that job anymore

and it was a misunderstanding.
It's, uh, it's stupid.

Wait, I remember that night.
No. That's impossible.

You're the guy
with the big spotlight.

First of all,
let's keep our voices down.

Because water,
sound travels differently

than it does, not water.

Sean told me a young man
needed counseling.

So I pulled him aside
to counsel him, okay?

Okay, but why was
your pants down?

We were in a restroom.

Makes perfect sense.

Makes perfect sense to me.
And a judge. A state judge.

Give me these. You know what?

Watch this.

Look what I'm doing
with my eyes. Watch this.

You see that?
You're not even looking at me.

Look what I'm doing with my eyes.
Can you do this?

I can see just as far
as those are.

Hello, attention everyone,
up here.

Hello, hi.

My name is Max.

I'm co-owner of this ship,

but I also happen to be
an old friend of Kiley's.

Now, as some of you know,

Kiley was a founding staff
member of the S.S. Party Boat.

And that first summer,
our original idea was

to just park her at the dock,

use her as a floating bar.

But it was Kiley

who stood up and told us,

something that has moved this
business forward ever since.

She said, "A ship is safe
in the harbor,

but that's not
what ships were built for."

Quickly we found out that
she got that

off of a mug
at the marina giftshop.

Wrap it up!

But that is precisely why
we love Kiley so much.

Because she knows
that pursuing adventure

is much more rewarding than just
sitting safely in some harbor.

And she also happens to be

the best damn bartender
in all of Lake Everett.

So watch your back, Jonathan!

<i>So raise a glass.</i>

To Kiley.

To Kiley.

Now, there is one more thing

that Kiley Abigail Miller
will not stand for.

And that is
a boring party, okay?

It's time to go off
the script a bit.

Off script?

So put down your cellphones,
toss your inhibitions,

'cause it's time to boogie!

â™ª I'm a jet set player
yeah I'm doing life right â™ª

â™ª Rooftop party man
them flashing lights bright â™ª

â™ª Big shot talking girl
I do it all night â™ª

â™ª Don't stop win it girl
let's get it right â™ª

â™ª Party in the penthouse
Trump Tower â™ª

â™ª Private jets any hour â™ª

â™ª Day or week â™ª

â™ª Dripping all them diamonds
diamonds platinum â™ª

â™ª In my earrings
so classy â™ª

â™ª Living like high rollers
that one percent â™ª

â™ª Yeah we do it
how we do it â™ª

â™ª And then we do it again â™ª

â™ª 'Cause we're the high rollers
don't forget â™ª

â™ª Yeah we in it just to win it
there's no limits we bet â™ª

â™ª 'Cause we're the hi-i-i-i-i
high rollers â™ª

â™ª We're the hi-i-i-i-i
high rollers â™ª

â™ª We're the hi-i-i-i-i
high rollers â™ª

â™ª We're the hi-i-i-i-i
high rollers â™ª

â™ª Call me Cool Hand Luke â™ª

â™ª 'Cause man
I really can't lose â™ª

â™ª Party with my people... â™ª

Man, they got some
fine <i>mamacitas</i> up there!

I knew it. I knew it.
I hate them.

I'm so jealous of the fun
that they have.

You know what you do when you're
a real cop in a real town?

You arrest people,
you put them in handcuffs.

Now look at me.

There's fish underneath us
right now.

Fuckin' fish.
I go to work with fish.

Hey, what do you bench anyway?

Are you a rep guy
or a max guy?

Out of my way!

What the hell?

Ken Doll-looking motherfucker.

Ma'am? Sorry,
I just wanted to make sure

you didn't need anything.

It can get kind
of unsteady out there.

What I need is fresh air.

It's rather pungent upstairs.

Like sweat mixed
with... failure.

Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to enjoy the view.

Max! Eomma overboard!

Eomma is overboard!

Oh, wow!
Oh!

When do we get to see
your boyfriend's rage face?

Does he even have one?

Greg's not much of a dancer.

Well, I'm sure he has
plenty of other fun,

youthful, carefree qualities.

Save me, you mofos!

Don't worry, I got you!

Wait! No! Don't touch me!

What?

Black people can't swim!

Oh! Oh, damn!

We had fun though, didn't we?

Always.

Um...

Is everything okay?
Are you sick?

Uh...

Kiley... ever since
we were kids,

I've always wanted
to tell you...

Oh, my God, Max.
Eomma's in the water.

What?
Loo...

Okay, okay, okay.

Just let me say
what I was about to say...

No, go! In the water!

Max, go!
Give me the jacket! Just...

Max! Max!

Calm down.
I'm trying to help!

Hey! I was finally
alone with Kiley.

It was the perfect moment!

What's the matter? You forget
how to save old ladies?

She's racist!
She's not racist.

She's Asian, man!
Asians can't be racist.

She's just old.

White devil!

White devil?
White devil!

She is racist.

What the hell is going on
down there?

Um, Greg's Eomma
fell overboard.

Max went in to save her,

but I don't know why there's
so much splashing.

Because she's drowning.
Lucky bitch.

Don't worry, ladies!
I got this under control!

BRB.

Is that guy slow or something?

Uh, no. He just lives
on Planet Jonathan.

It took me six weeks
to train him.

Oh! Not that asshole too!

Help! I'm a very poor swimmer!

What are you doing out here
if you can't swim?

I was trying to impress
Kiley's sister!

What?

Help!

I'll save her.
You help this idiot.

Max! Don't let me die!
I got you.

Max! Don't let me die!

I got you, just stop
poking me with your keys.

What keys?

Oh, my God!

Nobody panic.

I'm a highly trained
aquatic professional.

I am not gonna let you die!

I am not gonna let you die!

Oh!
Oh!

Oh, my God!
He's got a boner!

Dude, I was already hard
when I started kissing her.

Kissing her?
What the hell's going on down here?

Eomma, are you okay?

Oh, my God!
This shit is going viral!

We're gonna need a bigger boat.

You sure you're okay, Eomma?

I'm fine. Stop fussing over me.

Do you still have the ring?

You gotta be careful with this.
I don't trust the black guy.

Now, someone get me
some aspirin.

My head is throbbing
like that bartender's cock.

Hurry! Oh, jeez.

Here you go.

Uh... It's... Okay.

You know what? Here.
Take two.

Ooh.

Dude, what were you thinking?

Full mast?

So soon?

We don't want to scare Lauren,

we wanna... woo her, all right?

Don't get me wrong...

it was impressive the way
you handled that cold water.

You didn't back down
for a second.

Look, I know
how you can get, right?

You wanna...
you wanna rush in there,

you wanna save the day,
we all do, be the hero.

I need you to be patient...
and trust me. Okay?

That's all I need.

I need you
to stand down, soldier.

That a boy.
That... a... boy.

Bro, you told me
you fixed the railing!

I did! Which railing
were you talking about?

Dude, this shit is awesome!

You delete that video!

Freedom of the press, dude!

Yeah, don't censor her.

I can't believe I trusted you.

A woman almost died.

And you're uploading
the evidence to Instagram?

Come on, Sean.

Chuckie Walsh has never even
heard of Instagram.

These guys are dumber
than we thought.

Yeah. Only three hashtags?

What losers.

Total losers. What's a hashtag?

It's...
I'm talking about the old lady

almost dying.

Oh.

Why don't we just go in?

We can't go in, because
the old lady has to be dead.

Unfortunately,
she didn't die.

Right.

You're kidding, right?

Is that a home perm?

I want to get one, but I
don't think I have enough hair.

All right, that's it.

I'm getting this party back
under control. Give it up.

Give what up?

Max.
Sean.

Max.

Sean.

From now on, we're sticking
to the script.

It's time to call in
the big guns.

What are these guys
gonna do next?

Look at this!
Nobody's wearing a life-vest.

That's just safety!

Who among ye
be ready to die?

'Cause as of this moment...

...we pirates be taking over
this boat.

And we be taking you
to... Fun Town!

Ha ha ha! Arrr!
Yes! There they are!

Hey, guys!

Max! Water war?

Water war!

Two teams there be:

Red the color of blood

and blue the color
of the sea.

The rules are simple.

Only head shots count.

Three headshots, and ye be out!

Where ye
is shot, there ye shall fall.

Last one standing be the winner!

Are ye ready?

Are ye set!

Go!

Ha ha!

Fly, Carmichael, fly!

You go right,
and I go left.

I feel like he's right
in front of us.

I know, I just wanted
to feel cool.

You know, like an assassin.

Aww, you're my little assassin.

You guys are
on the same team!

Why?

Why, Little J?
Why was she immune

to all of our fire power?

Both barrels, both guns?

The plot thickens, doesn't it?

Hmmm, Lauren and I are going
to have beautiful babies.

So beautiful. Ooh!
It kicked!

'Cause it's a soccer ball!
Get it? It kicked it!

Murder on the high seas

part of one of your lists,
Greggy-boy?

Oh! Save yourself!

Save yourself, baby!

I'll always... love you.

No!

Sorry, Max.
But it's my party.

Just, uh, wait...
Just one second.

Just... You can, but just
wait one second.

Jonathan, hit it!

Uh, Jonathan!

Can you hit it?

On it! I'll hit it!

<i>â™ª One, you're like a dream come true â™ª</i>

â™ª Two, just wanna be with you â™ª

â™ª Three, girl,
it's plain to see â™ª

â™ª That you're
the only one for me â™ª

â™ª Four, repeat steps one
through three â™ª

â™ª Five, make you fall
in love with me â™ª

â™ª If ever I believe
my work is done â™ª

â™ª Then I'll start back at one â™ª

â™ª Yeah yeah â™ª

â™ª So... â™ª

All right, where we at now?

Uhh, we peaked at 73 decibels.

And the lake limit is 80.

Dammit!

The silky, dulcet tones
of Brian McKnight

are not getting us there.

Hey, uh, you don't think
you're going off the deep end

a little too much there, Chuck?

I have not gone
nearly deep enough.

Max! Dude, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah! Yeah.
What the hell was that?

How was I supposed to know
that was their song?

Oh, my goodness,
that was amazing!

How'd you know that was Greg
and I's karaoke song?

I didn't! I-I thought
it was our song!

You remember
the eighth grade trip to D.C.

We wore that song out!

Brian McKnight is
Greg's spirit animal.

You're the best!

You're welcome!

Dude, that was genius!

Oh, yeah?
See, I thought you were going rogue with the pirates

but a nostalgic watergun fight

moving seamlessly
into a romantic dance moment?

That's next level shit!

I like it. Keep it up.
Sure.

There's no sign of lake patrol.
You keep it up.

Yeah, man, I meant to do it!

Max! You were so right!
That Kiley chick is so cool!

I mean, holy shit,
her drinks are awesome.

She is the Nicki Minaj
to your Nickelback.

Nickelback is misunderstood!

And I could mix circles around Kiley.

I don't know about circles.

In fact...

I'll bet you that you couldn't.

That... was... awesome!
That was great!

That was great.
Hey. You.

It was you. All day.
Mow-wow-wow.

Okay, let's get outta here.

You're not going anywhere,
water scum.

Say bye-bye!

Lady! That's a rental!
That's our boat!

You thought you could
take me out, didn't you?

You do know
we're party pirates, right?

We had a bar mitzvah
last night.

My Father was
a Kuk Sool master.

Hand-to-hand combat.
Up close and personal.

Everything he learned,
he passed on to me.

Now, back! Back off!

Get in there!
Get in there!

Now!

Get in there!

â™ª Baby baby
baby baby baby â™ª

That's how I won the war.

That's right.
Took this baby all the way

to Vietnam.

What?

What?

You wanna bang Jonathan.

Supersoaker? I don't think so.

Come on. That's why
I brought you here.

How long has it been?
It's... forever.

It's been forever.

Yeah, exactly.

â™ª On my boat pourin' drinks
for ladies... â™ª

My ex-husband left me
for methmouth.

So what?

So, clearly,
having sex with me

is like riding
a rusty Ferris wheel.

So let him scrape off some rust
and lube you up!

Excuse me, princess. But I need
to steal the guest of honor

to help me settle
a bet. Okay?

What the hell is he doin' now?

Are you even...
I can't see. I don't have binoculars.

Ladies and gentlemen!
Boys and girls!

It's time to settle this one
once and for all.

Who is the best
party boat bartender

on all of Lake Everett?
Now here are the rules.

You'll be making
three drinks...

in three different rounds.

The best two
out of three drinks

will win
the entire competition.

Too easy.

Total cakewalk.
Who's the judge?

Drink number one:
Your very best rum cocktail.

Ooh!

You only have one minute
for each round.

Your time...

starts...

<i>now.</i>

<i>All right, flexing is not
part of the competition. Okay?</i>

All right, there she goes.

Looks like she's going
for something modern

and sophisticated.

Meanwhile, Jonathan is just
smashing citrus fruits.

Whoa! Behind the back!

Nice move from Jonathan.
He actually caught it.

Shake that shaker, girl!

Are you ready for Kiley
or are you ready for Jonathan!

Sean's taking all bets!

Who do you got?
Who do you got?

Something's coming together,

looks like a fruity daiquiri
of some kind.

All right, all right,
here we go!

And time! Time! Time!

Stop. Stop.
Back away, missy!

Back away.

Lauren?

I call it "Girls,
We Rum the World."

Yeah, ladies!

Very nice.

I call that the "Crooked Cock
and Hairy Balls."

<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>
Just...

Yeah. I'm just gonna call
this one. Winner!

Whoo!
What?

Go, Kiley!

<i>All right, round</i> numero dos.

Let's keep it easy.

<i>Shots.</i>
You can do it, sweetie.

Thanks, babe.

<i>Ready?</i>

Go.

Oh, God, Jonathan,
what are you doing?

Uh, could you pass me
that gin?

That's not a health code
violation, ladies!

He's been tested!

That's a health code
violation!

All right, looks like
they're almost done.

Who likes shots?
You like shots?

You like shots.
You like shots. You like shots.

You get a shot.
And you get a shot.

And you get a shot.

All right,
Kiley's just finishing up.

Here comes... It's getting
right down to the wire.

Jonathan better hurry up.

<i>Five, four, three...</i>

two, one, time!
Time. Time. Time.

Whoo!

Shots.

This is a "Dirty Harry."

Do you feel lucky? Bitch?

Uh, it's definitely dirty.

All right, well,

in honor of my Dr. Greg,

who's thrown such
a wonderful party,

please enjoy
some "Novocaine."

What?

Impossible.

Mmm. Oh, God, gross.

Greg, I told you
to give me gin, not vodka.

I-I'm sorry.

Never trust an orthodontist!

Jonathan takes round two.

And now, for the final
and most important round.

Bartender's choice.

You have one minute...

to prepare...

any drink you want.

And the clock... starts now.

<i>It all comes down
to this, party people!</i>

The master versus the moron!

Will Kiley keep her title?

Will Jonathan remember
to keep his shorts on?

It's anybody's game!

Oh, oh, he's walking away!
He's walking away!

Oh! He's comin back!
Here he comes!

Oh, he's got nothing on her!

Three, two, one!

Hands up. Drinks down.

All right.

This, I call
a "Quarter-Life Crisis."

Something we all know
a thing or two about.

Oh, shit. That's good, girl.

Uh-huh, whatever.

Who needs good
when you have...

the "Dwayne Johnson."

Strong as hell, but everybody
thinks it's over-rated.

But they're wrong.

<i>Survey says...</i>

Oh, yes, there you went!

Ba-ba-ba-ba. Ba-ba-ba-ba.

That means that
the winner and still

reigning champion
of the Lake Everett

party boat bartender
extravaganza is...

The Kileynator! Yeah!

Are you kidding me? Max!

Yes! Yes!
<i>Whoo!</i>

Whoo!
Wow!

Dude, that was so much fun.
Mm.

So... what do I win?

Oh. Well, I do have
one more surprise for you.

Follow me.
Of course you do.

I'll be right back, babe.

Let's go.

That was amazing. Whoo!

That was good.

She's still got it.

I think I need to move
this proposal up.

Sure thing. When?
To now.

Okay, uh, I just need to cue up a few...
No, no, no, sorry.

Let me put this another way.

If you don't get Max
under control

and you don't pull this proposal
off without a hitch,

I'm not paying for any of this.
You understand?

Yeah.

This way, right this way.
What are...

My birthday surprise is a trip
to the storage room?

Not exactly, I gotta find it.
Just, uh...

Oh, my God,

you still have this old thing?

Oh, yeah.
I love this hoodie!

Whatever happened
to my red hoodie?

Currently, it is being worn by
a mechanical large-mouthed bass

at the bottom of the lake.
Oh.

Now I'm jealous
of a cozy, singing fish.

Spotlight good?
Sean,

I can't find Kiley anywhere.

Hey, everything is all good.
I got it set.

We're ready to go...
No. I need to find her now.

Let's go.
Okay.

Whoa!

Do you remember this?

Diver Dan.

Came out of retirement
at his own party

to jump in the lake
and save that entire family.

Oh, what a legend.
Yeah.

Hey.

The nurses!
The spring fling, right?

Yeah! By the end
of the night,

they were giving
each other IV drips.

That's not all they were giving each other.

Ah-hah! I found it!

What?

This.

What is this?

This is the flower
that I gave you

the night of your last party
ever on the boat.

Senior's last dance!

Yes! Yeah.
I remember you gave it to me at the bar!

Yeah.

Why do you still have this?

Just needed a memento.

Of a high school
graduation party?

Of the night... that I knew...

That you knew what?

That I knew that...

There you are.
I've been looking for you!

Uh, Max was helping me find
my bartending prize.

Yep! And we're still looking
for it so...

Could you come back
to the deck, baby?

There's something
I wanna show you.

More surprises!
Well...

it's a surprise in that
it's something

I've meticulously planned
for months,

preparing for every contingency,

leaving no room
for unplanned results.

So, yeah! Sure!
Cool.

Get out of my way.
I can't have you messing up the program.

And I can't have Kiley marrying
that jackass.

I know you love her.

I know you've loved her
since forever,

but stopping him from what
he's about to do right now

is not the right move, man.

Oh, what.

It's all about money,
I'm assuming, huh?

Oh, you mean that thing
we have none of

because every time
we leave the marina,

you find a way
to get us fined.

Money is your thing!

So you deal with it.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Sean! Come on!
What are you doing?

I'm dealing with it!

First mates forever?

I'm sorry.

I screwed everything up.
I thought my,

my bartending prowess
could get the job done.

I needed your energy up there.

Your spark.

Okay,

let's keep it
together, man, okay?

If we dig deep
and work as a team,

we can find a way
to get Lauren's heart racing.

I have an idea.

Follow me.

Tough loss.

Mmm, I threw it on purpose.

Made a bet with Max
that I'd win.

Mm.

Come on.
I want to show you something.

Okay.

In Korea, this is called
<i>jug-eum-ui chum...</i>

the Dance of Death.

Throughout his entire life,
my father was undefeated

and tonight,
I will continue his legacy.

Aaaaaah!

Now you.

Stupid slow finger.

Man, this is the bullshit
I'm talking about.

â™ª A tisket a tasket
a green and yellow basket â™ª

Pathetic!

Father, guide my hand.

Who is the victor?
Eomma!

Who is the victor?
Eomma!

Who is the victor?
Eomma!

Oh!
Oh!

Oh!

Eternal shame!

<i>Can I get everybody up
on the main deck please.</i>

You're going through some heavy stuff right now, aren't you?
Yes.

Divorce. Heartbreak. Self-loathing.
Yes.

Mmm. Colors are muted, food has no taste.
Yes!

What do you need, Lauren?

I need...

What do you need?

I need...

that Dwayne Johnson.
Hmm.

Testing. Testing.
Testing, one, two, three.

K-I-L-E-Y.

L-O-V-E.

Y-O-U.

Lights!

Good evening, everybody.

I'm up here because I have
something very important to say.

So here goes.

Oh! Ah!

Okay, okay.

Kiley...

you are the center
of my universe.

You're the light...

that illuminates my life.

Well, it's a good thing
I am one negligent bastard.

Oh, yeah.

What the hell is he doing?

I remember the first day
that we met.

I saw you from across the room.

You threw your head back,
and you started to laugh.

It was the most beautiful smile
I've ever seen.

Aww.
Aww.

I knew from that instant
that my life

would never be the same.

But here's the thing:

If you all know Kiley,

you know what
her favorite show is, right?

<i>So You Think You Can Dance!</i>

So You Think You Can Dance!

Okay. All right.
Come on! Come on.

She never misses an episode,

which means,

for better or worse,
I never miss an episode.

So a few months back...

I was thinking how can I make
tonight extra special.

<i>And so...</i>
No.

<i>Yes!</i>
No. Really?

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Okay. Okay.

Come on up here, guys!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Oh, God!
This is incredible.

<i>Hit the music, Sean.</i>

â™ª Jump left right
up and down â™ª

â™ª Left right up and down â™ª

Ha!

Oh!

This is gonna be fun.

â™ª Left right up and down stop â™ª

â™ª Show me something... â™ª

What the hell's
gotten into you?

Aspirin.
Oh, no!

Greg's mom!
Those weren't aspirin.

Sweet dreams, boy band.

Oh! Ah!

Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

Oh!

â™ª Jump left right
up and down â™ª

â™ª Left right up and down â™ª

â™ª Left right up and down â™ª

â™ª Left right up and down... â™ª

Oh! Oh! Oh, yes!

â™ª Stop
show me something â™ª

Oh, my God! Oh!

Shhh!

Make sure you drink
a lot of water tomorrow, okay?

You won't remember a thing.

Ah!

Oh!
Greg!

Oh! Oh, my God.
<i>Ah!</i>

Oh!
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

Good dancing, guys.

Okay, now...

now for the main event.

No...

Eomma! Eomma, could you
join us on the dance floor?

Greg, You need to go
to a hospital.

What I need... is Eomma
to be on the mark!

Screw it.

I'm fine. Aah! Oh!

Kiley... Abigail Miller...

will you marry me?

Please?

Will you marry me?

I...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Hey! Oh, you okay?

What the hell was that?
W-W...

You just threw a buoy
at my boyfriend!

First of all, it's not called
a buoy, it's called a fender.

But what the hell
was that though? Right?

I just thought
it was a birthday dance.

I had no idea
he was gonna propose.

Well, it's okay.
You did the right thing.

I just need time... to think.

It's weird being back
on this boat with you and Sean.

Good weird though... right?

I don't know.

I guess. Yeah.

So... my whole life I've had
this idea of the perfect moment.

But now, I think that maybe,

you know, sometimes you just
got to take a leap of faith.

So...
So I should marry Greg?

No, I mean that I need
to take a leap of faith.

Because I love you.

Yeah, I love you too.

No, I mean...
I'm in love with you.

Shit!

I know.

You know,
you could not have picked

a shittier time
to dump this on me.

Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
come on.

It could be you and me.
Like it always was.

Just having fun.
Living in the moment,

partying on the boat
all the time.

It's just that now,
there would be...

a little kissing thrown in.

Come on, Max.

That was...

Yeah! It really was.

I only hit my head
like a thousand times.

I only pulled my groin twice!

You wanna know something?

What?

I knew from the second
I saw you

that we had the most...
amazing connection.

Shut up.
No, I'm serious.

You wanna know
how serious I am?

When I saw Max,

I bet him twenty bucks
we'd get together.

What?
Yeah.

Which is something we do,
uh, but normally, I don't win,

or I do win,
but I can never provide proof.

I can't believe this.

No, no, no. I-I'm saying
I-I normally lose the bet,

b-but I saw my soulmate

and when you have a soulmate,
you can't lose!

I'm making this worse, aren't I?

Actually...

no.

I've never been
the subject of a sex bet.

It feels awesome.

I don't want you to worry
about a thing, Greg.

I'm gonna get us back
to the marina. Okay?

What's the point?

Just throw me overboard.

Hey, Sean...
No... I need you to take this

and, uh, get some ice
for Dr. Kim's leg. Okay?

But, Sean...
Why aren't we moving?

That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

I think we ran out of gas.

What?
Did he just say we're out...

Go get the ice.

Um, look, you relax this leg.

Excuse me for one second.
I'll be right back.

Are we stranded?

Eomma? Are you okay?

I-I lost the Dance of Death

and was defeated in battle
by a pasty manchild.

My father is looking down
on me with shame.

Hey, you can't let
his approval run your life.

Look...

Eight years ago...

I told my father
that I like women,

and he totally freaked out.

And then fortunately, I haven't
spoken to him since.

But that's on him and not me.

Understand?

I think I do.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Can I help you...

get out of this?

Hey! There you are!

Guess what?
I finally told... Whoa!

Hey! What is...
Come on.

Hey, What's up?

You said you filled the gas!

Ha! I say a lot of things.

We're stranded out here.

And if I call lake patrol,
we're totally screwed.

Lake patrol, really?

You're still afraid
of those guys?

You've been letting Walsh
push you around

ever since high school.
They're not pushing me around, Max!

They're trying to kick us
off this lake!

That's our business.
The one that you have again

put yourself ahead of.

You've compromised everything
we ever worked for.

We can find more money.
No, we can't! There's no more money!

Have I ever let you down before?
Yes!

Fair enough!

There is no way that Greg
is gonna pay for this party

after you just ruined
his proposal.

You know what?

We're done.

What, you don't want
to be partners anymore?

I don't know if I even want
to be your friend.

Oh!

You hear that?

Wait, what the hell is that.

Is Greg about to jump?

Greg, what the hell
are you doing?

Leave me alone, Max!

And there it is.
Someone's finally going to die.

Just... go get Kiley.

Greg?

Why don't you just come back
to the party, man?

You know? Show us some more
of those cool dance moves.

I think I broke my ankle.

Yeah, um...

Listen, man, about that.
I'm really sorry. Okay?

I just... I got really...
carried away.

Yeah, so did I.

I don't know
what I was thinking.

Well, you were thinking about
sweeping her off her feet, man.

It's a poor choice of words.
I'm sorry. I...

Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

Hey. Uh. Yeah.
Quick question.

Why aren't we movin'?

I was actually just reading
some of your Yelp reviews,

and apparently
you guys are pretty...

Kiley?
...well known for running out of gas.

Kiley? Kiley?

Yeah. Okay. Good talk.

Whats up?
Greg's up front,

says he's gonna jump.
Shit!

Greg doesn't know how to swim.

I'm telling everyone

you guys are irresponsible
and incompetent.

Yeah, why haven't you called
for help?

Fine, you know what?
What's the point.

Everyone hold tight
while I call lake patrol.

Greg. Greg, what are you doing?

I'm sorry, I couldn't say... yes
to your proposal

in front of all those people.

You were never going
to say yes.

I clean teeth,
and I wear seersucker.

Yeah, but you were
rockin' it, man!

Lake patrol, this is
S.S. Party Boat. Come in, over.

Well, well, well. Let me guess,

that menace of a ship of yours
ran out of gas,

you've got a passenger
that's about

to commit harakari
off the bow,

and you're on this radio
to beg for mercy.

Well, guess what?

You're not getting
any mercy, Meadows.

No. Say the word.

I want to hear you say
the word,

and we can call this off
once and for all.

Over.

I just wanted to say that

your people have
the most beautiful skin.

And you are a wonderful,
wonderful swimmer.

Uhh, you okay?

Flyin' high.

Mayday.

Greg.

Baby, just come down.

Okay? We'll go to shore.

We'll get your leg fixed,
and we will talk about this.

You know, I always thought

Max didn't like me
because I'm an orthodontist.

Tonight I realized it didn't
have anything to do with me.

It was always about you.

I'm allergic to dogs,
and I clean retainers.

I thought I could dance, but...

Now I know.

Oh, what's the point.

Whoa, whoa! Hey!
Whoa! Hey, man!

Hey! Greg, We got you

a lifetime supply
of Allegra at Costco.

You make
people's smiles straighter.

Without you, I would have
never opened the shelter.

You force me to believe
in myself.

Greg...

it's Max again.

Uhm, I've known Kiley
since fourth grade

and you've known her,
what, two years?

So, that kind of makes you
a Kiley novice.

Shut up, Max!
No, no, no, I-I got this.

Trust me.

Greg, listen to me,
you two left-footed

son of a bitch.

She loves you.

No, she doesn't.

Yes, she does.

Just tell him.

Come on, Kiley.

Just take the plunge.

Oh, no, no, no, no. Not...

Not you!

Jesus, this guy's so literal.

Hey,

you know what you have to do.

You can't be afraid
to move forward.

I love you,

but so does he.

And I know that you love him.

You can do this.

Gregory Hampton Kim...

will you marry me?

Attention, everyone!

I would like to present

the future Mr. and Mrs....

Nobody cares. Okay?

What are you doing on our boat?

Your buddy got on the radio
and said those magic words.

Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Which gives me

full authority
to come on board

and commandeer your vessel,

so I'm commandeering
your vessel.

Hicks over here is gonna write
you guys so many tickets,

you'll never pay them off.

You'll think your student loan
is a nickel

found in the couch.

I've waited ten years
for tonight.

Ten years since we...

caught you counseling
that kid in the bathroom

and got you kicked
off the force.

Mmm.

What is that, Hi-C?

You're a pussy,
and I'm embarrassed for you.

This is like a, what,
a high school reunion?

Is that what you guys
are doing here,

getting the gang
back together?

You got the Hawaiian shirt guy.

We have the theater nerds,
still playing dress-up.

What are you, forty?
What are you doing?

What is this?
We got the teen mom,

still trying to convince
everybody she's still hot.

Mm-mm. Luke warm.

Very high luke warm,
don't get me wrong.

There's the popular girl,

still playing
with all the boys' heads.

Then we got the wise ass.

Everything you say gets
everybody else in trouble.

You know that?

Then we have the know-it-all.

Well, guess what, Sean?
You're not a know-it-all

because you partnered
with a wise ass,

your boat ran out of gas
and it sunk,

and that's why I'm here.
You're done.

In two days, you guys are going
to be pumping gas, you follow?

You're gonna be pump...

Wow.

There is-you can tear it.

Pumpin'... Pumpin' gas.

Pumpin' ga... Whoa!

Fishies. Pumping... Pumping gas.

Pumping gas,
pumping gas, pumping gas.

Pump's a funny word! There are
two P's. Pumping gas!

What in the hell is going on?

So, you know how Chuck has been
snatching cups out of my hand

and chugging 'em
since we were freshman?

I took a couple
of those Combo Locks

and put them in my drink.

Pumping gas,
pumping gas, I'm pumping gas.

Pumping gas.

Come on, let's go.

Are you serious?
I am.

Boogie-woogie-woogie...
Whoo!

Whoo! Volume!

I believe Officer Walsh
is asking for some volume.

Would you like to provide
the man with some volume?

I think I would.

Are you sure you're okay?

Yeah, Max gave me
some aspirin!

Wha...

Hey, sparky,
what's your full name,

rank, and badge number?

Lake Everett Patrolman
Chuck Walsh,

badge number 2-5-5-3!

2-5-5-3! Whoo!

And what are you doing
on this boat?

I'm tripping balls!

What was that?

I'm tripping balls!

Yeah, I'm tripping balls!

Yo!

Sorry I dosed
your partner, Hicks.

Not even worried about it.

Looks like
I'm getting bumped up.

Also...

looks like you won't be needing
these citations.

Hey!

My man!

Let's party!
Let's party!

Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any spare gas, would you?

I think I got a few cans. Yeah.

Let's party, man.

Let's party.

I gotta say,

epic party, Max.

Thank you.

You know, I got some ideas
on how to cut costs.

Get a little leaner,

except you'll have
to show me the, uh...

The books.
Yes!

Then again you'll have to
tell me what the numbers mean.

Absolutely.

But you do know tonight wasn't
all about the money, right?

I know.

I'm really proud of you,
Seanie boy.

Yeah?
Yeah.

For what?

Standing up to Walsh
the way that you did.

That took...

You know?

I also want to thank you
for always having my back too.

Tonight, last week...

the last twenty years.

Dude. First mates forever.

Ah, Seanie,

I love ya. Always have.

I love you too.

Now...
Uh, there it is.

Oh! Oh!
There it is.

There it is.
Hold on. Hold on. Look at this.

Cheers.

Mmm.

Whoo!
What do you say

we show these people
how to really party?

Especially that girl
right there.

Right there? Let's go.
Yeah.

Let us dance til' dawn! Arrgh!

Body roll!

Fly, Carmichael. Arrr!

That was the best party
of my life!

I'm telling everyone
you guys rock!

Awesome.

Please let me stay!

I wanna live on this boat!

Thank you.
You don't gotta go home,

but you gotta get
the hell out of here!

Thank you, guys.

Eomma, I hope we showed you
a good time.

It was the night of my life.

What the hell was that?

That's the S.S. Party Boat
weaving its magic,

that's what that is.

Uh, should we get breakfast?

It's on me.

Ooh.

That guy's crazy.
It might work out.

Guys, this is my masterpiece.

Too bad you have to delete that.
Mm-hmm.

Freedom of the press, no way!

What! What happens on the party
boat stays on the party boat.

Stays.

Guys,

I can't thank you enough.

Oh, Greg, you don't have
to do this.

Tha-That party was a disaster.

Hey. She said yes, right?

Well, technically, she said no,
but then you said yes.

I'm a man of my word.

You should really hang out
with us more often, Greg.

Really?
Yeah.

It's good with me, matey.

Well, just take it easy
on the mateys.

Okay?

I'm gonna go catch up
with my Eomma, all right?

So, floating wedding next year?

Again, about everything,
I'm really sorry and...

Stop it.
You threw a great party,

and you gave me the greatest
proposal story of all time.

Anything for my first mate.

Come here.

L-Let go.

Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Let go.

My bad.

Congratulations.

Thanks, I'll see you soon.

You got it.

Wow.
Yep.

Our work here is done.

And nobody died.
Nobody died

Hey, Sean!

You know what I was thinking?
What's that?

Tahiti.
Tahiti?

Tahiti.
You wanna do Tahiti?

Absolutely.
We should do Tahiti.

Sailboat.

You like it?
Dude, I love it.

You know what?
I do like Tahiti.

I'm telling you man,
stick with me,

I'll make all your dreams come true.
We're going places,

we're going places.

Tahiti!

We're coming for you, bitches.

Oh, God.
No rush. There's no rush.

Hey, Hicks, what's Eddie Van
Halen look like in real life?

I don't know. Get to the bed.

Three locks, three locks.
Get to the bed. Get to the bed.

I'm going! You're not even
on the bed.

I know I'm not.
Oh, my God.

You know what? You need
a quesadilla. You need one.

No, no, no, lay down.
Lay down.

Walsh!
What?

Lay down!
I got muenster in the fridge.

Lay down and relax!

I'm relaxed, you're the one
that's not relaxed.

Alright, Walsh.
I'll see you later.

Probably at your hearing.

At my hearing.

I can hear.

Hicksy, slide me over
one of those buckets, okay?

Which one?

It's too early to tell.

You know what, just scoot over.

You're too wasted
to leave alone,

and I'm too tired
to go home, so...

Big spoon or little spoon?

It's too early to tell.

Are you sure this bed is...

Oh, God.

I can smell your sunscreen.

Go to bed, Walsh.
