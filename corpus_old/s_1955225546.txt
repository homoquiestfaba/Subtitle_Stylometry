             Man:               
   Look at the size of her!     

      And the skin tone--       
         what a glow.           

It's hard to believe            
she's finally here.             

Julia, it's our first,          

       And look at her,         
   she's so soft and cuddly,    

         you just want          
        to squeeze her!         

What a beauty.                  

We've been dreaming             
about this for so long.         

         Won't bruise,          
        won't spoil...          

    Genetically improved,       
    resistant to disease...     

             And--              

             Both:              
      They taste better!        

                  You two really
               need to get away.

I love you.                     

             Man:               
       All in the wrist.        

                        See?    

          The finger,           
       watch the fing!          

     Nobody wants a finger      
        in their salad.         

      Besides, you might        
        need it one day         

    For a special occasion.     

            Hey...              

         Fresh bread,           
       oh, that's good.         

       Don't get bland, come on,
           seasoning, seasoning.

               Let's taste that.

               Oh, that is good,
                     mmm, mmm...

     Now remember, folks,       

      Keep things cooking       
       whilst I'm away.         

                        Leaving?

            Where are you going?

A couple of weeks               
of fun ithe sun                 
with my kids.                   

            Kids? You have kids?

Yeah, two of 'em,               
boy and a rl.                   

And they're both                
just like me...                 

Irresistible.                   

                      Mmm...    

            Mmm...              

I have to retake this picture,  
it's horrible.                  

            You can't reta it,  
         we're leaving tomorrow.

People are gonna                
see this, mom.                  

                Who do you think
               works at customs,
                 cindy crawford?

                        Come on.

          I'm excited about th  
                  we're gonna go

    And have the best time      
         in our life.           

       You, thomas, me,         
           russell,             

        We're gonna be          
    on that little island,      

   It's gonna be beautiful!     

   Balboa island is perfect     
         for families.          

We're not a family.             

         Yes, we are.           
      We will be, anay,         

       You just have to         
       get to know him,         
       he's really nice.        

Unless I dress up               
like carrot                     

And max like                    
a piece of lettuce,             

's not even gonna               
notice we're there.             

        That's not true         

          Hello, sweetheart.    

Asparagus.                      

           What? Oh.            

      Hi, kids, I didn't        
        seyou there.            

Now, julia,                     
I just found out                

That the cargo hold             
is not pressurized.             

                    Lucky for us
             we're flying coach.

Yes, well, not all of us        
are samples, remember?          

It's freezing down there,       
they'll never survive.          

            We'll take the crate
            on the plane, right?

Won'fit in the overheads--      
I checked.                      

           What are we gonna do?

              Buy a plane ticket
               for the tomatoes?

              You didn't, right?

I had to.                       

Julia, they're so delicate,     

And then think about            
our corn and our squash,        

And what about                  
our eggplants?                  

You know how temperamental      
they can get.                   

Yeah, but the next thing we know
  they're gonna fly first-class.

                        Russell?

                       Russell?!

Coach was booked.               

We can't show up                
at the symposium                

With frozen                     
or mashed samples,              

We are finalists for            
the templeton grant.            

                         I know.

                   You're right.

Now, that flight is full,       

So they had to put us           
on the next flight.             

                 Are we at least
               sitting together?

Oh, no, I mean, julia,          
I'm sorry,                      

I-I meant that you              
and suh--, um, suh--            

                     We're nna  
            sit together, right?

Yeah, you and the boys          
are gonna still fly tomorrow,   

I meant we...                   
The vegetables and I.           

             Whoa!              

            Loui                

Ha h                            

              I'm gonna get you!

                      Come here!

                          Ha ha!

       ( both laughing )        

             Aah!               

               Stop it, matthew!

               Matthew! Matthew!

     He's been waiting two hours
                for you to come,

              Now that's enough!

Hello...                        

              Oh, no, you don't!

                     Oh, no, no!

 Dad, you're too old for this.  

          And hello to you...   
                 Too!           

            Yeah!!!             

Aaahh!                          

                 She sends a few
           every week, you know.

   Yeah, thoughtful of her.     

        A woman audits          
    an anthropology class,      

   Flips for the professor,     
      next thing you know       

        She's living in         
      some cave in peru.        

                 All ght, now,  
        never mind their mother.

                    You promised
                      those kids

           You were going to    
        find a bigger place.    

                 I know, I will.
              But I'm takin' '  
                    on vacation.

Well, matthew,                  
showing them a good time        

For two weeks every summer      
is really not enough.           

           They're getting toe  
               too much for you.

No, that's not it--             
they need their father.         

                       ( sighs )
                     listen, ma,

                 Just let me get
              my life organized.

                The restaurant's
                 up and running,

               But we're working
              seven days a week,

               Lunch and dinner,
         it's a lot of pressure.

Matthew, what's more important? 

Your job or your kids?          

                 You know I love
               my kids to death.

Then why don't you show it      
and be there for them?          

     ( alarm clock rings )      

             Yes!               

          ( snoring )           

     How did so many years      
         of evolution           

     Bypass this one room?

        You look tired          
           and pale?            

          Mom, it's five o'clock
                 in the morning.

    Right.                      

Five-oh-three, actually.        
Check your watches.             

           ( beep )             

And off we go.                  

        ( bell tolls )          

        Come on, guys,          
        let get going--         
          we're late!           

We're always late.              

         If dad hadn't          
        slept so long,          
     we wouldn't be late.       

                You did it, too.

Let's get that                  
in there...                     

There...This goes

Okay, ma.                       

Thank you so much.

        It'lkill your grandma.  

You wouldn't want to            
lose your safety net, right?    

                     I told you,
              I have to do this,

             It's for all of us.

             My kitchen's almost
            working like I want.

              We're all gonna be

                   By the end of

             Or I smash your car
                 out of the way.

Because I

One-twenty...                   
Ahead of schedule,              

We made excellent time.         
Look at that!                   

         That's ours--          
           all ours.            

   We can hike, bike, swim--    

Sail?                           
           Sail.                

        Come on, kids.          

                 Come on, louis.

                           Merv.
           Merv!                

                  Come on, daph.

                  Come on, daph,

          We start our vacation,
                 it's tradition!

         A sacred family ritual.

        We can free our spirits,
              cleanse our souls,

       Wash off the daily grind!

Can't we just unpack            
or something?                   

         Come on, dad,          
    she doesn't want to go.     

           Let's go.            

               Okay, find. 'bye!

           Aaahhh!!             

                 We're going in!

                We're going in!!

                         Daphne:
           What are we gonna do?

     Do I love this place!      

            Ahh...              

            Louis:              
           Shut up.             

Daphne:                         
Here, louis,                    
take your backpack.             

      Dad, can we just break in?
       'cause I really gotta go.

I gave you the key.             

      This is so typical.       

         Why isn't it           
        on your chain?          

What chain?                     

   You need to get a chain,     
 'cause this is why it's lost.  

         Dad, I really gotta go!

Maybe there's                   
a window open.                  

                       ( sighs )
              I'll keep looking.

      ( sigh of relief )        

                      Ahh...    

             Aah!               

             Aah!               

       Thomas, did you see him?!

    Mom, they're after us!      

What? What is it?               

                     She's here!
                   In the house!

               See? Right there!

          What the--            

Oh, my god.                     

      That's that lunatic       
        from the ferry!         

           You! Hey!            

          Hey, lady!            

      I know you're mad,        

      I know you're angry       
     you missed the ferry,      

     But you're here now,       
        okay? So relax.         

  I don't know that you think   
    you're doing in there,      

        But you are in          
     some serious trouble!      

    Open up is door--now!       

      You open this door        
    or I'll break it down!      

       I'll not tolerate        
         any violence.          

       I have a weapon--        
          step back!            

       I'll use it, too,        
           now shoo!            

                     "shoo"?    

That's right,                   
leave us alone!                 

This is my house!!              
                           Yeah!

Your house? Ha!                 

            Right--             

         That does it!          

Then use your key!              

                  Good one, mom.

     I can't find my key!!      

Don't make me hurt you!         

    What are you gonna do,      
       lob me to death?!        

This is trespassing!            

Okay? It's breaking             
and entering!                   

It's harassment!                

     Yes, and with good behavior
     you might be out in a year.

Me? Well, we belong here,       
because we have keys!           

Daddy.                          

        Well, so do we!         

              Ha!               

            And.                

           It fits.             

             See?               

            Woman:              
           Come on,             
     don't worry about it.      

    They're right in there.     

    ( all talking at once )     

           This is just a simple
       misunderstanding, really.

     I rented the house to you--

             Yes.               

    And then I leased it to you.

      Yes--the software,        
     just a few glitches.       

We love this house              
and we were alreadmoved in.     

            You moved in because
    you cut us off at the ferry.

You cut a whole row off         
at the ferry.                   

 I rent this house for two weeks
        every summer--it's mine.

Oh, really?                     
Well, I happen to have          

A fully executed                
rental agreement.               

I have one of those, too.       

Not on me, or...                
Hermetically sealed in plastic. 

What about the deposit?         
I sent in a wire transfer--     

Dihe pay?                       
I bet he didn't pay.            

       Of course I paid!        

           Didn't I?            

     Let me see...              

            Let's take a look...

 Yes, we received your check,   
   mr. Fariker, on the 10th.    

      Oh, we redeposited        
for lack of funds on the 13th,  

  And received miss weeland's   
     transfer on the 14th,      

      So I suppose then,        
        technically...          

But that's not fair.            

      Sorry, sweetheart.        

         Take it easy,          
       they'll find you         
        somewhere else.         

                     Well, wait.

             See, that's kind of
              impossible because

     The whole island is booked.

Booked? What--                  
what do you mean, booked?       

     Oh, yes, every room,       

     Every inn, every bed       
        and breakfast--         

     It's our busy season.      

                           Busy.
          Busy.                 

Too bad, we've already          
moved in here                   

And we're not                   
going anywhere.                 

         Yes, you are.          

No, we're not.                  

 I mean, really perfect, dad,   
   they're total strangers.     

            You think I like it?

     What are we supposed to do?
            Evict them by force?

Yeah!                           
                           Yeah?

            Look it's only for--

         --One night.           

 We'll keep our doors locked,   

And they'll find ather place    
        in the morning.         

       Like they're gonna leave.

I hate this vacation!           

           ( sighs )            
             okay.              

                      Excuse us.

                      Excuse me.

The produce is beautifully      
displayed in your country,      

But what are these?             
Golfballs?                      

                No, they're just
                   not ripe yet.

             When they do ripen,
              they turn to mush.

        You should see          
         my tomatoes.           

I'd love to see                 
your tomatoes.                  

What? She gets to               
see 'em and not me?             

I live with the woman,          
and she won't show me           
her vegetables.                 

                   I do not live
               with this person.

          I merely share a space
                 withis family  

                For a very, very
         limited amount of time.

No, I've generously agreed      

To keep them off the street     
for a night.                    

                           Hmph.

So what's so special            
about your tomatoes, huh?       

                  Redder, riper,
                      juicier...

Green thumb?                    

             Ph.D.              

In tomatoes?                    

What do you minor in,           
brussels sprouts?               

             No, my degree is in
            genetic engineering.

Oh, franken-fruits,             
fish genes in the tomatoes.     

Bunch of radioactive vegetables 
souped up in a lab, huh?        

                 There's nothing
         radioactive about them.

            Better than anything
   you'd ever put in your salad.

Listen, sweetheart,             

You trone of my salads,         

You'll think you died           
and gone to heaven.             

   Really? What are you, a chef?

Yeah.                           

      Burger king or mcdonald's?

            Woman:              
   Checkstand 5 is now open,    
  no waiting at checkstand 5.   

       Are you together?        

         No!                 No!
No!                  No!        

         Who's first?           

          Let's get these things
                 out of the car.

                            Aah!

                        Louis...

        Thanks, daphne.         

      Here's one for you,       

              Some for us...    

          Come on, let's go.    

                         Daphne:
        Dad, watch your fingers.

         Lovely fresh parsley...

           Ha ha ha!            

           Ha ha ha!            

       Perfect, perfect.        

       Now...Hot, hot...        

     Oh, smell it, this is      
      going to be superb.       

     Are you expecting applause?

   It's all in the balance,     
           you know.            

         I'll tell you          
   something about applause.    

    Smell, smell, smell...      

            Mmm....             

         You can tell           
          a whole lot           

        About a person          
     by the way they cook.      

          Bon appetit.          

Ha ha!                          

After dinner we have to sit down
        and make some schedules.

Schedules?!                     

   Yeah, for cooking and cleanup
           and showers and such.

Lady, you're only               
gonna be here one night.        

            No, you're only here
                  for one night,

           And I want everything
                in perfect order

       For when russellrrives.  

Tell me russell                 
is a turtle...                  

Or a small hamster.             

Close.                          

          Russell's my colleague
                  and my fiance,

     And he's arriving tomorrow.

That's when                     
the real fun starts.            

            Ha ha!              

We've got an uptight            
german dude coming?!            

Actually, he's an uptight       
american dude.                  

                  That's enough.

                 Russell daniels
                  is a brilliant
                      scientist,

               And a very decent
                    human being,

         And fortunately for me,

             Both professionally
                 and personally,

        He's part of an exchange
              program in munich.

All beverages included?         

                      Excuse me?

It may be the language barrier, 

But you soun                    
just like a brochure.           

Well, our english is excellent--

       Their father is american.

And you...                      

Guess you might have a thing    
for english-speaking guys, huh? 

     You'll never make it across
        this border, believe me.

Ha ha ha!                       

                  Don't mind me,

               I'm just going to
                   wedge in here

               On this amazingly
                 rock-like sofa.

I called heads.                 

      ( car horn honks )        

       ( rao blaring )          

           Matthe               

            Felice!             

        How are you, sweetheart?
           I knew you'd be here!

Delighted, for                  
the first time all day.         

I'll be right down.             

             Okay.              

      ( turns radio off )       

                Wow...          
              Who's that?       

    It's felice.                

    I thought she               
    got married.                

    ( sighs )                   

                         Felice:
         Same old story, though,

                 You know, first
             he's madly in love,

 Then daddy mentioned that nasty
       little word "prenuptial,"

           And things cooled off
                   considerably.

           Makes a woman wonder,

         Was he in love with me,
             or my mutual funds?

Well, for me, it's you, fece.   

It's always been you.           

                  Oh, you should
                   have told me.

No, it's not what you think,    
not what you think at all.      

                 You wanna cook?

You had to ask?                 

        ( starts car )          

                     Good night.

       'night, darling.         

     Oh, and don't forget       
        daddy's party.          

           ( sighs )            

          Psst! Daph!           

         Daph! Louis!           

           ( sighs )            

                           Merv?

                    Hee hee hee!

Julia:                          
Russell,                        

Do you know what I              
really, really want to do?      

    Oh, russell, make love.     

      I want to make love       
        in the dunes...         

You do?                         

And the surf...                 

Again and again...              

    Again?                      

         And again...           

    Mmm...                      

         ( sniffing )           

           Russell?             

             Aahh!              

                           Aahh!

                      Aahhh!    

               Get out! Out!    

                    Get out!    

          ( snoring )           

        ( door closes )         

           Russell:             
            Julia?              

            Julia?              

                     Ungh...    

                    Don't shout!

                       Ungghh...

                    Lemme guess,
             you're the hamster.

I beg your pardon?              

                 Russell, right?
Ssell.                          

                    Hi, russell,
         how ya doin'? I'm matt.

Matt?                           

                I'm in love with
                    your fiance.

Ugh!                            

         I know it sounds crazy,

                 I know it comes
                     as a shock,

       But one night with that--

                     Hey! Oh ho!

                    I don't have
                    to tell you.

                       Ha ha ha!

Julia?                          

      She makes that booty talk!

Julia weeland?                  

             Yeah.              

            Julia:              
           Russell?             

Julia!                          

Julia.                          

Julia, who is this man?         

                Um, he's nobody.

                Uh, it's nobody.

       You don't have to        
        pretend, julia.         

    I told him everything.      

       Ignore him, please. Okay?

Julia...                        

Julia, who is he?               

                      Hey, matt.

         He came with the house.

     Where's the coffee?!       

         Where is it?!          

Hi, boys.                       

Good to see you.                

Ha ha ha!

                           Yeah.

That dog just

       He smells! Beast.        

                Don't talk about
       your boyfriend like that.

             Whoa!              

            Sorry.              

             Ahhh!              

Ha ha ha!                       

                  Are you crazy?

Are you okay, honey?            

Thomas, my friend,              
you've got a choice.            

Spend your life memorizing,     
or take a chance.               

Go on, talk to her!             

        Looking is a lot easier.

Do you want to                  
go for a ride?                  

Come on!                        

                            Dad!

             Dad!               

           Russell:             
          Oh, my hat!           

    Is that pride and prejudice?

    Yeah.                       

               I love that book.

Me, too.                        

                  I readt when  
                 I was your age.

Oh, really?                     

I'm only halfway through it,    
but it's an excellent book.     

      It's such a beautiful day.

    Hey.                        

                Come on, thomas.

Um, actually, I've never        
rode a horse before.            

              No problem, kiddo,
  the sand will break your fall.

                  You all right?
Yeah.                           

            Thomas!             

       Get down! Thomas!        

            Omas!               

Get down from that horse!       

           Mom, we're just going
   for a ride, it's no big deal.

You don't know                  
how to ride a horse.            

           It's time he learned.

Not here, it isn't.             

If you want lessons,            
you can take real lessons,      

From a proper instructor.       

          It's no big deal, mom,
      we're riding on the beach.

All we need right now           
is for you to fall              

And crack your head open,       
get down.                       

       He's real gentle,        
   you don't have to worry.     

           You hear that, julia?

     Thomas, it's gonna be fine.

Thomas, get down.               

             Now!               

  You made me look like an idiot
           in front of everyone.

Thomas--                        

                            Mom.

      Just leave me alone, okay?

Julia:                          
They survived the trip          
beautifully.                    

           Yes, indeed they did.

             Oh, would you look?

             Look at the curves,
        look at the proportions.

        Not too shabby.         

                        Wow!    

                 This would make
          one awesome parmigian.

        Oh, no, no, no.         

        These eggplants         
     will never be cooked.      

     We're presenting him,      

       Along with all of        
      the other samples,        

 At the genetic botanical arts  
  symposium in san francisco.   

                Wow! Can I still
           get tickets for that?

       I....Don't know!         

     But we are finalists       
for the symposium grand prize.  

       Is that like the pulitzer
                  for fake food?

          Fake food?            

You can make your little cracks 
about our work,                 

But let me tell you,            

Whatever stunts you pull        
on this island is your business,

Just leave my boys              
out of it.                      

                   This is about
        the horse riding, right?

            Julia, you gotta let
        your kids have some fun.

Excuse me?                      

                    Both o'em.  
                Let 'em breathe.

          You're smothering 'em!

Oh, like your children,         
letting them run wd.            

                    My kids know
                    spontaneity.

So do mine.                     

Within a certain                
safe structure.                 

            Now, please, please,
                    settle down,

         Everyone has his or her
         own style of parenting.

        What's yours, professor?

                 You're gonna be
                  a parent soon.

Well, you...                    

I'm sure russell                
will impart                     
the same wisdom                 

And resourcefulness             
he shows in the lab.            

          Ha ha! I bet the party
      never stops at your house.

        Oh, thank you.          

         ( grunting )           

              Oh!               

                         No!    

                     My eye!    

                 Ow! My eye!    

                     My eye!    

               Look what you    
              did to my eye!    

    Ah!                         

                         Ha!    

Let me see that.                

Find any?                       

Chest hairs.                    
I saw you looking.              

I did the same thing            
with my boobs.                  

            No luck either, huh?

    Wow...                      

You mean your dad               
makes these?                    

               Yeah, he sends me
            the ones with flaws.

                 See, this one's
                 almost perfect,

               Just a tiny crack
                    in the iris.

Bitchen.                        

What do you mean,               
he sends you them?              

     He lives in california now.

Yeah, my mom                    
lives in peru.                  

                           Peru?

Yeah, she's on                  
an expedition.                  

She sends me gifts              
that she digs up,               

Like last time she sent         
this really cool statue.        

                        Bitchen.

Yeah, I guess it is.            

And I thought                   
you were mad at me.             

    Please. This is for russell.

Russell?!                       

Listen, he's adorable,          
but he's bunkin' with you.      

                  It's only till
             my kids are asleep.

You gotta be kidding me.        

The two of you                  
are engaged.                    

                 I don't have to
             flaunt it all over,

              Like traipsing off
         with some strange woman

     In the middle of the night.

What, with felice?              

You should be so lucky.         

       Heeeey, roomte.          

Hey.                            

              Ah.               

          ( snoring )           

     ( snoring continues )      

           Russell.             

          Yo, romeo!            

              Oh!               

          You're on.            

              Ah.               

             Ssh.               

        Coming, coming.         

                   I missed you.

Oh, no, darling,                
no, I couldn't.                 

I couldn't,                     
no, I--                         

Not with him                    
in the next room,               

I just, I--                     
I can't,                        

Oh, sweetheart, ow!             
Ow! I just can't, I--           

( snores )                      

                    We're going!

             Huh?               

See you later, mom.             

            Where--             

     Where are you going?       

            Thomas!             

Dad.                            

                      Hey, daph.

                    What are you
                    up to today?

Um, we were                     
going skating,                  
remember?                       

                       Oh, sure.

                        I, uh...

Forgot.                         

              Well, no, I, um...

            Well, I just thought
         maybe we'd do it later.

Whatever.                       
I'll see you later.             

                     Oh, sorry--
                     I love you.

    What?                       

                     Um, europe.
                  I love europe.

Isn't that                      
a foreign country?              

                       Yeah.    

Cool.                           

                   Come on, kel,
                       let's go.

Do you wanna hang?              

                       Hang?    

Yeah. Just chill.               

                   By all means,
           let's hang and chill.

She is so bizarre.              

             Yeah.              

Forget that, man,               
I'll teach you.                 

I'm an excellent sailor,        
I've been lots of times.        

             Well, I don't know.

What do you have to do,         
go ask your mommy first?        

                         No.    

           We don't have a boat.

No problem.                     

                  What do we do?

Here, take a live vest.         

             How do I put it on?

    Zip it.                     

Max, just grab the front.       

Turn it around--ready?          

One, two, three!                

       ( both grunting )        

               All right, now we
               gotta push it in.

Louis, I really dot             
know how to sail.               

           Don't worry about it,
           I'll take care of it.

                       Ungh!    

                    Come on!    

                          Julia:
      He says I smother my kids.

     I don't smother them, do I?

No, not at all.                 
Look at this one!               

                       Oh...    

                       Ha ha ha!

                     Oh, this is
             the life, isn't it?

                 Just you and me
     and all these wild berries.

How wild do you                 
want to get?                    

            You mean right here?

     Oh, julia, I would love to,

              But all these poor
        little berries, I mean--

                 And think about
            the stains involved.

Well, the house--               
it's empty.                     

                           Yeah.

           Max, grab the rudder.

I-I'm not ready yet.            

                   Come on, man,
                     just do it.

Okay.                           

                       Watch it.

               Grab the serer.  

                         Got it?
Yeah.                           

             Max:               
         Hey! Thomas!           

         Hey! Thomas!           

Hey, thomas, look,              
I'm sailing!                    

                     Oh, my god.

                    Is that max?

Look, I'm sailing!              

Thomas, look!                   

             Ha ha ha!          

            Oh, my god, the dog.

      Oh, leave the dog.        

          Merv! Merv!           

          ( humming )           

       Ow! My feet hurt!        

                 Oh, you rascal.

             Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

                   Oh! Russell?!

Don't stop now.                 

                       Aahh!    

             Aah!               

Julia! Where you going?         

Come on, julia,                 
don't stop now...               

We'd just gotten started!       

Julia!                          

Where is she?                   

             Um...              

Julia.                          

It was karl binder              
from the symposium.             

They want us up                 
in san francisco                

                        They do?

We are going to                 
fill in on a panel!             

                          Ha ha!

It's such an honor!             

Unh...Unh...                    

Aah!                            

You should get dressed.         

What did he do now?             

                        He left.

Figures. Where to?              

                To guest lecture
               at the symposium.

My father?                      

             No, I mean russell.

Men suck.                       

                 Don't say that,
                        not yet.

         Hey, daphne,           
        there you are,          

       I've been looking        
       for you all day.         

                     Wuzz?      

       Hey, I know you,         

       Don't tell me...         
        You're my son.          

                      Ha. Funny.

Where's your brother?           

                He's out sailing
                     with louis.

          He's what?!           

            Sailing, with louis.

                    Don't worry!

         Louis is a good sailor,
                they'll be fine.

            Well--              

     ( thunder crackles )       

       ( louis screams )        

Louis!                          

    No!                         

Louis!!!                        

Here, grab on!                  

          We're doing           
     everything possible.       

       You can't tell us to just
            stand here and wait.

         Our ds are out there!  

       Sir, if you care         
        about the kids,         

      You will calm down        
    and let us do our job.      

Come on! Grab on!               

Hold onto my hand!              

You listen to me--              

You're gonna get on that horn   
and get out the whole fleet     

If you have to                  
to find our kids!               

Now! You understand? Now!       

          Yes, ma'am.           

    Come on!                    

                    ( coughing )

            Radio:              
      Things are getting        
    pretty rough out here.      

    This is the coasguard       
  reporting offshore swells,    

        Wind northwest,         
         50-75 knots.           

    Vessel is described as      
       a small sailboat         

    With two male juveniles     
           on board.            

          Helicopter:           
          Roger that.           

   Reporting clearing skies.    

    We have them in sight.      

       What's your eta?         

     Eta 20 to 30 minutes.      

          Help! Help!           

       Hello! Over here!        

       Over here! Help!!        

The waves were like             
200 feet high,                  

I thought for sure              
we were shark bait.             

    You must have freaked.      

No, I was cool.                 

        The point is, your safe,
           you had an aenture.  

An adventure,                   
is that what this is?           

            Well, it's something
                they'll remember

        The rest of their lives.

They're lucky they have         
the rest of their lives.        

            Julia, take it easy,
                   they're fine.

Yeah, an hour ago               
you were a bowl full of jello.  

                          Jello?

   I would never, ever be jello.

              Chocolate pudding,
             maybe, never jello.

That's it.                      
                           What?

Out of the house,               
I want you guys                 
out of the house!               

        Mom, it's not his fault,
       okay? It's not his fault.

Thomas, they're dangerous,      
don't you see?                  

     But it's not louis's fault,
     he's a good sailor, really.

           I made him do it.    

Why would you                   
do such a thing?                

           To learn how to sail.

  I thought maybe if I knew now,
    dad might take me next time.

I'm sorry, louis.               

I'm sorry,                      
I thought it was you.           

    Usually is.                 

                Don't get cute--
       the repairs for that boat

                  Are coming out
              of your allowance.

I don't have an allowance.      

                        Details.

    Thanks.                     

                  Just don't say
             you weren't scared.

         ( knocking )           

No lights.                      

            I know.             

You, uh, gonna be all right?    

          Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

C-c-c-can I sleep with you?     

                      What?!    

Just sleep with you.            

                     I told you,

        I thought it was russell
                  in the shower.

You know, in the corner,        
or on the floor.                

I could cram in                 
behind the chair over there.    

                  You're afrai  

No, I'm not afraid,             
I just feel a little...         

 Exposed, sleeping out there    
 in the living room.            

   You know, thunder is just air
 suddenly heating and expanding.

Can I sleep here, or not?       

                   Not! Go sleep
                  with the kids.

I don't want them to know.      

       ¶ it's amazing ¶         

         ¶ how you can          
   speak right to my heart ¶    

   ¶ without sayin' a word ¶    

 ¶ you can light up the dark ¶  

      ¶ you say it best ¶       

¶ when you say nothing at all ¶ 

           ( sis )              

            Ha ha!              

       Okay, watch this.        

Put it on!                      
              Ssh!              

                 Is it true that
         all good chefs are men?

          No, there's           
      women masters, too.       

                         Daphne:
                          Dad...

        Let me tell you         
       something, guys.         

       Every man should         
      learn how to cook.        

How did you do that?            

      I'm glad you asked.       

   It shows inquisitiveness     
    and a scientific mind.      

       It's practical--         

      In a world of love,       
 it's a very persuasive skill.  

               What do you mean?

        If you cook for         
      a woman you adore,        

    Prepare it and serve it     
     with your own hands,       

    That woman, my friend,      
        will be yours.          

                  Mine for what?

Thomas:                         
Matt, you're a professional--   

What are we supposed to         
cook for girls--grilled cheese? 

         Why not? Cook anything,
  as long as you do it together.

          There's only one thing
                  more seductive

                Than cooking for
            a beautil woman...  

 And that's cooking with her.   

Hey, uh, max,                   

Maybe we suld go                
check on the shrimp.            

                  We're gonna go
            check on the shrimp.

      I'll be right back.       

     We've improvised just about
 every home experiment there is.

And I've cooked                 
just about                      

Everything perishable           
in the entire house.            

Except your vegetables,         

And I wouldn't dare             
touch your vegetables.          

                   You can touch
                  my vegetables.

                         Really?

Um-hmm.                         

                          Julia:
                  Where are they
                      all going?

I don't know,                   

Maybe the clubhouse             
has some power--wanna go?       

Man:                            
Wendell, you survived!          

There's bottle water            
in the back.                    

Clubhouse is for                
owners only--                   
I'm so sorry.                   

        Oh, gee, that's too bad,

              I guess that means
    we're just gonna have to eat

               All these skewers
                of spicy shrimp,

              Stuffed mushrooms,
                   eese puffs,  

      Canapes and chocolate cake
               all by ourselves.

Hey, everybody,                 
they brought food!              

Feed her.                       

                         Hi.    

    Hi.

                   I made these.

Hey, guys,

            Ha ha!              

                 Boy, do we have
         some good news for you.

We found several vacancies.     

Several vacancies?              

  Yes, isn't that wonderful?    

The storm must have             
washed some folks away.         

                     Out to sea.
                       Ha ha ha!

         There is still, though,

    The question of which family
         is gonna have to leave.

Well...                         

That is what you want,          
isn't it?                       

                     Absolutely!
Of course!                      

Well, the trip's                
most over, right,               

So I think moving               
would be such a disruption.     

                   And the kids.

             The kids are really
              getting along now.

It would be a shame             
to split them up.               

       So I think I'm just gonna

         Have to bite the bullet
              on this one and...

                       Stay put.

                 Okay.          

             For the kids' sake.

          For the kids' sake.   

           All right, okay,     
            we got to run.      

What do they mean               
"for the kid's sake?"           

            To our first time...

               Cooking together.

    Yes.                        

  Today we're going to be making
      a lot of different dishes.

             've got all these  
    fabulous fresh ingredients--

             Vegetables, spices,
                   herbs, and...

        Julia, you don't have to
                     take notes,

     It's n a chemiry class.    

               Cooking is a very
            sensuous experience,

            It's all about taste
             and smell and mouth

      And color and touch and...

Okay.                           

                  It's hands on.

                    Take it off.

What?                           

                      The watch.

       You have to take it off--
                let me help you.

Well...                         

                           Oops.

                   There we are.

                    Um...Salmon.

          Look at that marvelous
                     piece of...

          Fresatlantic salmon.  

                    ( sniffing )
    mmm, I thought we'd poach it

               And serve it with
         a tomato buerre blanc--

              What do you think?

Can we use my tomatoes?         

I got them from the market.     

                    The market--
               the organic ones.

       I think we'd love to cook
             with your tomatoes.

                         Daphne:
                So when are they
                getting married?

Thomas:                         
Mom said after                  
the potato crop comes in,       

And then we've got to           
move to america                 

So she caninish                 
her exchange program.           

     So you guys are going      
        to be a family,         

      Like all together?        
         Not like us.           

Dad said I'm moving in          
with him this summer.           

      Get it in writing.        

Come on.                        

 I'd much rather have your dad  
not around than russell around. 

Unh-uhn, just...                

                But threcipe--  

Good chefs always               
cook by feel,                   

Now come on,                    
put your hand in.               

Yes...                          

             Now for some oil...

  ¶ sometimes I feel myself ¶   

     ¶ losing control... ¶      

                    What's next?

We let it rise.                 

                      Feel good?

( panting )                     

               You're dad's fun.
         He makes you feel good.

Well, your mom's                
smart and interesting,          

And really cool.                

       She's interested,        

      I mean, she listens       
    and she's really cool.      

What if they...                 
Got together?                   

                No way!         

    You saw them danceogether,  
    I mean, I'm just saying.    

Yeah, I could see that          
totally happening.              

            Dancing's one thing,
 but a couple? I don't think so.

He's a lot different            
than russell.                   

All righmerv, come on.          

              Why don't you just
            leave the dog alone?

Felice asked me to              
drop this tuxedo off.           

Here's matt's invitation,       

She said she'll                 
see him at the party.           

            Thanks.             

Looks like they've              
been cooking.                   

       Smells more like         
 they were burning something.   

      Hey, dad, I got this stuff
            for you from felice.

For her father's                
birthday party.                 

              Tonight? I forgot.
                         Thanks.

You're going, right?            

           Oh, I got a lot of...

                Straightening up
                     to do here.

No, no, it's my mess.           
I'll do it.                     

I'll do it!                     

( irritated: )                  
go on, I'll clean up.           

                      Wake up...

        What's with you tonight?

I'm sorry.                      

Must be too much sun.           

Come on.                        

         Who's hungry?          

 You're                         
 gonnaook?                      

             Um, no, your father
              left a few things,

            So I'll reheat them.

    Good.                       

              Felice's last name
                   is templeton?

Um-hmm.                         

                   Her father is
               cedric templeton?

Um-hmm.                         

 As in the templeton fountion?  

Um-hmm.                         

      My god, it's in the grant.

        This is great!          

    Okay.                       

          Oh....Oh...           

Happy birthday.                 

      My gracious alive,        
       it is beautiful!         

Like it?                        

        Oh, thank you!          

         Good evening,          
         how are you?           

                  Oh, thank you.

              Oh!               

            Cedric:             
         Well, well...          

    Julia.                      

 Is this my birthday present?   

    ( all laugh politely )      

          I'm dr. Julia weeland,
          sir, nice to meet you.

Well, it's nice                 
to meet you.                    

Is that for me?                 

                     Yes, it is.

   And it's my honor to wish you
          a very happy birthday.

Vegetables.                     

         ( all laugh )          

    Ah...                       

           Genetically improved.

                They're bursting
                     with flavor

              And saturated with
        every essential vitamin.

Well, they are colorful.        

She blocked an enzyme.          

      I beg your pardon?        

She blocked an enzyme.          
Sir.                            

              Oh.               

Hold on. Dr. Weeland?           

You're one of                   
the grant finalists.            

                   Yes, sir.    

              And mr. Templeton,

              If you'll just try
           one of my vegetables.

             Aide:              
         No, no, no...          

                   I'm afraid he
                  can't do that.

                    Now, just...

Julia, julia.                   

Julia.                          

                      I'm sorry.

                  I'll take care
                   of this, sir.

Well, ahem,                     
what's next?                    

          What am I going to do?

                  Three years of
            scientific research,

            What was I thinking?

It's gonna be all right.        
Come on.                        

        Oh, thank you!          
        Oh, thk you!            

    ( swing music playing )     

     Ladies and gentlemen,      
       enjoy the buffet.        

                         Cedric:
                Yes, let us eat.

Come, come, come.               

            Cedric!             

             Yes?               

In honor of your birthday,      

I have created something        
really special.                 

My gift to you.                 

                     That's, uh,
          too rich for you, sir.

Nonsense.                       

       Sir, remember your ulcer.

    Fork!                       

    Genius.                     

                    Pure genius.

Thank you, sir,                 

T I'm only as good              
as my ingredients.              

The real genius here            
is dr. Julia weeland.           

  These are your vegetables?    

Yes, they are.                  

    Oh, they are exquisite.     

      Smythe, write her a check.

              I beg your pardon?

You heard me--                  
the grant money.                

                 Sir, what about
            the other finalists?

                  The committee?

I am the committee.             

                       Sir, sir.

Do it!                          

Oh, mr. Templeton,              
thank you so much.              

You don't know                  
what this means to me.          

            Ha ha!              

                      Julia.    

     Why did you do this for me?

Russell:                        
Julia!                          

          Um, just another dish.

Forget the vegetables, darling, 

      I've got something        
        better for you.         

                          Julia!

Russell!                        
Where did you come from?        

              Timothy, your son,
        he told me what you did.

 Thomas.                        

   You-you brought mr. Templeton
                    our samples?

                   The tenacity,
           the ambition of that!

                Congratulations.

Ha ha ha!                       

We've won, russell.             

              Oh, this calls for
                  a celebration.

              Let's get married.

What?                           

           You want spontaneous?
      I'll give you spontaneous!

           Is there a justice of
              the peace in here?

Get married now?                

I think it's a wonderful idea.  
           Isn't it?            

         Well, I think that's...

                    Up to julia.

No, no, no.                     

I can't get married.            

Not without my sons here.       

            Let's surprise them.

No. No. They hate surprises.    

They always say,                
"mom, please don't              
surprise us."                   

We'll have to wait.             

           Until tomorrow, then?

Tomorrow?                       
                       Tomorrow!

Hey, dad.                       

             Hey.               

Dad, why don't we               
go to the beach?                

The waves are                   
totally great today.            

      Yeah, we should go.       

I'll go get my suit.            

    No, I mean leave here.      

What?                           

                            Why?

        I don't want to         
       be here anymore.         

          Excuse me.            

But it's not time               
to leave yet.                   

           ( sighs )            

      Go pack your bags.        

But I don't want to go!         

    I said pack your bags!      

      You hear me? Move!        

      Ah, louis, come on,       

        Wait a minute--         
          I didn't--            

                  Is it that bad
                  being with u  

Daphne, it's not                
about you and louis.            

Okay?                           

Hang on, will ya?               

    ( sighs )                   

                        Hey.    

     Russell's a good man.      

       Solid. Reliable.         

Sounds like                     
you're buying a car.            

                    I like matt.

We thought                      
you liked him.                  

       Matt-matt's fi           
        for a few weeks         
        on a vacation.          

      A person like that        
        in real life...         

    Gets tiring real quick.     

And russell?                    

                   He'll put you
                       to sleep.

        You know what,          
           you guys?            

     I'm marrying russell.      

  I'm not gonna get involved    

       With another man         
  who walks out on his kids.    

                           Matt:
                            Hey.

            Come on, let's walk.

    Look, I wanted to leave     

      Because I feel like       
       we're intruding,         

    It's got nothing to do      
      with either of you.       

You know this is                
the only time                   
we spend together.              

         No it's not.           

Yes it is,                      
and you know that.              

    We've had a great trip,     
          haven't we?           

       I mean, we've had        
     a lot of fun, right?       

                           Yeah.

                    We come here
                and we jump into
                the stupid ocean

                  And play house
          for a couple of weeks,

  And that's supposed to last us
           the rest of the year?

           Why don't you want to
                be with us, dad?

             I do.              

You have a funny way            
of showing it.                  

        Come on, guys,          
        you know I want         
        to be with you.         

            When it's convenient
              for your schedule.

     How can you say that?      

              Because it's true.

      You keep saying next week,
        next month, next year...

                     What are we
              supposed to think?

      Look, I'll make it        
     up to you, I promise.      

               You don't have to
               make it up to us,

                  Just be there.

                  Be our father.

           ( sighs )            

Tt, this is yours. Matt--       
                          ha ha.

               It was big of you
         to cut your trip short.

I wouldn't want to              
rain on your honeymoon.         

You're a lucky man.             

                         I know.

Max, I can't take that.         

I mean, I-I don't even          
have anythg to give to you.     

               It's okay, louis,
                you already did.

                    Thanks, max.

Hey.                            
                           Hey. 

So, um, call me when            
those chest hairs come in.      

     Yeah, same wityour boobs.  

I guess I'll be                 
calling you first.              

               Stay weird, daph.

          Strange works for you.

Here, dad.                      

Catch you later, man.           

                      Take care.

                        I just--

Sure.                           

            Thanks.             

                         Thomas.

         Remember, always go for
                  what you want,

      And be kind to the ladies.

'bye, julia.                    

'bye, sweetie.                  

                     Max! Ha ha!
           Keep on sailing, boy.

                    But be safe.

Ye, sweetheart.                 

          Thanks for everything.

Thank you.                      

Daphne told me                  
about your plans.               

  Oh, yeah, we're gonna look for
   a 3-bedroom when we get back.

         Figure I need my kids  
                 around me to...

                Keep me in line.

I'm happy for you, matt.        

         I'm happy for you, too.

           Russell:             
            Julia.              

       I told the judge         
     we'd be there at two.      

Two, two-fifteen,               
what's the difference?          

Let's go.                       

Come on.                        

Russell:                        
Can't keep him waiting.         

Hey, max!                       

I'm gonna keep an eye on you!   

                         Daphne:
          Louis, get in the car.

            Thomas:             
     See you later, guys.       

Daphne:                         
'bye!                           

            Judge:              
      E have to                 
        get readnow,            

      Everybody together.       

   You are so lucky, julia.     

        You found a man         
    who loves you for you.      

   You share the same work,     
      the same interests.       

            Judge:              
 Can we get going now, please?  

        Shall we begin?         

    Yes.                        

  Sir, the eggplant. Please.    

           What? Oh.            

                      Oh, right.

                     Well...    

        ( sputtering )          

                Just be careful.

            So now can we begin?

    Yes.                        
                           Yes. 

    Max.                        

           Russell:             
 Boys, I need some quiet here.  

   Boys, what are you doing?    

              No!               

      Catch it! Catch it        

           Russell:             
      He's irreplaceable!       

   Oh, my god, the chlorine!    

Russell, save max!              

            Thomas:             
           Max! Max!            

Max! Here, max!                 

You went for the eggplant!      

                    He can swim!

                 Quick, take it,
   the chlorine's gonna ruin it!

                Some fresh water
            and a towel for him.

I hope you two will be          
very happy together.            

       ( all laughing )         

         Guys, you did          
       a very good job.         

See you later, russell.         

              Wha-- toby! Timmy!
                          Tommy!

                       Tony!    

          Oh, my baby, oh...    

       Oh, no, oh no, oh....    

        Oh, she's delicious.    

          Well, guys,           

    If we're gonna do this,     
   we better get organized.     

           You know?            
 Make some schedules, lists...  

Since when do you eat tomatoes? 

        Julia said it's a fruit.

We're never gonna               
make this ferry.                

                   Yes, we will.

     ( tires screeching )       

          ( honking )           

            Julia!!             

                   Hiya, cookie.

You cut in line.                

                          I did.

           Sometimes you have to
    to get where you want to be.
