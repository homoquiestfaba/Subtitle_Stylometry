              Ow!

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

      <i> Â¶ There's always</i>
      <i> Someone saying Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Somebody needs</i>
    <i> Something changing Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ It's all a game</i>
       <i> We're playing Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ It's never ending Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ And no one can keep up Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ Makes you feel</i>
     <i> Less than perfect Â¶</i>

        <i> Â¶ Feels like</i>
   <i> It's so not worth it Â¶</i>

<i>Â¶ Labeled some kind of misfit Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Tell me haven't you</i>
     <i> Just had enough? Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ Beauty has many faces Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ You'll see them</i>
     <i> Different places Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ I only wanna be myself Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ And I am beautiful Â¶</i>

           SUZANNE:
 <i> That goofy ballerina is me.</i>

  <i> At this point in my life,</i>
<i> I didn't worry about my weight</i>

       <i> but, of course,</i>
      <i> that didn't last.</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ And I am beautiful Â¶</i>

 <i> Â¶ You can refuse to listen Â¶</i>

        <i> Â¶ To all the... Â¶</i>

 SUZANNE:<i> Like most average</i>
       <i> American girls,</i>

      <i> I grew up seeing</i>
<i> 200 to 400 advertising images</i>

        <i> of what women</i>
  <i> are supposed to look like</i>

     <i> every day of my life.</i>

      <i> Â¶ And who you are</i>
       <i> Is just fine Â¶</i>

 <i> Â¶ Unique and one of a kind Â¶</i>

 <i> Â¶ No pressure now to define Â¶</i>

<i> Â¶ Anything to anyone but you Â¶</i>

SUZANNE:<i> The women in the ads</i>
<i> we see are a size 0 to size 4.</i>

   <i> Even though the average</i>
<i> American woman is a size 14,</i>

        <i> the same size</i>
     <i> as Marilyn Monroe.</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ And I am beautiful Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

SUZANNE:<i> Ninety-six percent</i>
      <i> of American girls</i>

      <i> say they feel bad</i>
      <i> about themselves</i>

   <i> because they don't look</i>
     <i> like a supermodel.</i>

      <i> Â¶ I am beautiful Â¶</i>

      <i> Â¶ I am beautiful Â¶</i>

     SUZANNE:<i> There are</i>
<i> three billion women on earth</i>

       <i> and 100 of them</i>
      <i> are supermodels,</i>

   <i> which makes supermodels</i>
<i> the rarest of genetic freaks.</i>

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ I only wanna be myself Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

<i> thousands of hermaphrodites,</i>

  <i> people with the genitalia</i>
       <i> of both sexes.</i>

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

         <i> Â¶ I'm happy</i>
   <i> When I'm just myself Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

           SUZANNE:
      <i> So don't feel bad</i>

    <i> you're not a genetic</i>
      <i> freak supermodel.</i>

   <i> Feel bad you don't have</i>
    <i> a penis and a vagina.</i>

       Because at least
 you had a shot at that one.

          ( LAUGHING )

           All right.

      <i> You guys, papers</i>
     <i> are due on Friday.</i>

           Please,
     I have office hours.

        <i> My TA, Elise,</i>
      <i> has office hours.</i>

         Come to us.
     I want to help you.

       I want you guys
     to impress me, okay?

SUZANNE:<i> It's ironic I teach</i>
<i> Feminist Media in Los Angeles,</i>

          <i> the belly</i>
 <i> of the entertainment beast.</i>

      <i> No real woman can</i>
<i> live up to Hollywood images,</i>

  <i> not even the women in them.</i>

SUZANNE:<i> I'm not actually fat.</i>
 <i> But you can't tell me that.</i>

   <i> Even on my wedding day,</i>
  <i> when I had lost 15 pounds</i>

<i> and was swimming in my dress,</i>
 <i> I didn't feel thin enough.</i>

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

   SUZANNE:<i> My whole life</i>
 <i> I have had one simple wish.</i>

  <i> To finally stop obsessing</i>
      <i> about my weight.</i>

       <i> Â¶ I feel alive Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ And I am beautiful Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

         <i> Â¶ I'm happy... Â¶</i>

 SUZANNE:<i> How you choose to</i>
<i>think about a small roll of fat</i>

     <i> can change your life.</i>

 <i> For me, it all started with</i>
<i>a woman's head between my legs,</i>

    <i> but not in a good way.</i>

           ( SIGHS )

             Hm, you're running
                    out of time

              to get these buns
          in your oven, cookie.

   Statistically speaking,
     the day you turn 40,

   your chances drop by half.

            Boom.
             Oh.

                      You know,
       I called over to the lab

      and they haven't received
      your husband's sperm yet.

 <i> Five more days, we're gonna</i>
 <i> have to freeze those eggs.</i>

 What's his big problem anyway?

       He's very busy.
      It's pilot season.

         Big TV executive can't
     find the time to jerk off?

    I thought that's what
       they're best at.

              Ha.

   Well, you better get a jar

   and you better drive it
     to the lab yourself.

   <i> Get on the stick, sister.</i>

       Okay, I'll do it.

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

       Who's a good boy?

 Come on, buddy, we're gonna
 go see Daddy at the office.

   Okay, buddy, go kennel.
     Oh, he's a good boy.

       He's a good boy.
    Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

      Good boy, go kennel.

           Good boy.

             Okay.

     That's Daddy's sperm.

          Good boy.
            Stay.

  <i> Â¶ This is where we decide Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ To put it all behind Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ Yeah yeah yeah yeah Â¶</i>

    You can't just drop by
the office for a jar of sperm.

I'm taking the week off
so that I could get knocked up

and so that I could
neuter the dog.

              Why didn't we get
  a labradoodle, like I wanted.

                  Now we've got
             this nutless mutt.

Don't call him that.
He can hear you.

         Look, honey,
 I get that the hormone shots

     are making you moody.

<i> Moody?</i>

Do you realize
that I have gained one pound

for every single day
this week?

               Look, sweetheart.

 Mm-hm.

     A man in my position
     can't just jerk off

        in an equal opportunity
                     workplace.

       The lawyers told us this.

You have a private bathroom.
What's that for?

           Michael?
      It's not for that.

  Oh, hey, speak of the devil.

                  Oh, I'm sorry.

Don't worry.
I was just telling my wife

      what a great place
       this is to work.

     Hi.

          You know,
that equal pay for equal work

      and blah blah blah.

( PHONE RINGING IN BACKGROUND )

     Jessica's in reality.

     Right. We have some
      awesome new shows.

  We have this one that we call
       "Dancing With the Cons."

            It's a contest show.

                  It's convicts
           singing and dancing.

            And I'm telling you,

             these convicts are
          surprisingly likeable

     and really talented, right?

              For, like, crooks.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

        Wow.

Well, so,
this has been great, Jessica,

thanks very much
and I'll be with you shortly.

                Oh, sure.

                   Sorry.

                        Thanks.
              Nice to meet you.

      Nice to meet you.
       Super cute dog.

SUZANNE:
<i> Aw, thank you.</i>

       I like his little outfit.

( CLEARING THROAT )

She couldn't be
more adorable.

             Ha.
             Ha.

            ( CLEARING THROAT )
     Wow, they just get younger

         every year, don't they?

    What's with the cookie
    poufed-up fakey lips?

            Oh, oh, I like 'em.
          Fake is the new real.

Really?

  You know what, though?
  I have been really distracted.

                      I'm sorry.

I know but we have to
focus on this.

This is our life.

     No, no, I'm focused.
We have to get this together.

No, no, no, I'm focused.
I'm focused.

                          When?
              When, when, when?

Well, on Thursday
we have that therapy session
at Beverley Hills.

                      Yes?

I'll go to the clinic
after that and make a
big old deposit, okay?

                        Promise?

       Yeah, bucketful.

                 Oh, thank you.
                    I love you.

                      All right.

   It's four pounds from today,
            but I will take it.

You know what, baby?
On you, it looks good.

                No, it does not.

My grab handles right here.

       <i> Oh, don't call it that.</i>
                  <i> I hate that.</i>

                   I got to go.
               BooBoo, come on.

Yeah, get that dog
outta here.

                       SUZANNE:
       <i> He's a good boy, c'mon.</i>

That is not a good boy.
It's not even a boy.

Really, I don't even know why
we're in couples therapy today

'cause we're actually
really happy.

<i> It's just that I'm trying</i>
<i> to get pregnant</i>

and we just sort of thought,
you know, we'd come in

and do a little preventative
something, you know.

<i> I mean, it's not like</i>
<i> we really have any issues.</i>

It's probably
just a waste of time.

          ( GIGGLING )

        Well, Suzanne,
        as you know--

My God.
Oh, my God.

 You're leaving me.

<i> You're leaving me.</i>
<i> He's leaving me.</i>

He's leaving me.
He's leaving me.

He's leaving me.
You're leaving me.

     Suzanne, we've talked about

    these hormone-induced
mood swings you've been having.

No, no, this is not
a hormone-induced mood swing.

 This is how he fires people.

I've heard him do it
on the phone.

He says this phrase,
really calm, like,

"As you know,
as you know,

like as you know,
the ratings are bad.

As you know,
profits are down,"

and then the poor son-of-a-bitch
that he's firing,

he says it so many times
that at the end of it,

he's, like,
"I know, I know. I know.

I know, I know,
I know, I know."

       Suzanne, please sit down
   so we can work through this.

          ( SOBBING )

                Michael.

     Michael, would you like to
  address what Susan just said?

                Yeah, of course.

It's Suzanne!

           Of course.

        Well, I wanted
     to harvest the eggs

             because I'm really
           a strategic planner.

                 That's kind of
           my number one skill,

           although I don't get
             any credit for it.

    Mm-hm, but what about
    what Suzanne just said

          about you leaving her?

  Could you please address that?

            Oh, I'm leaving her.

            I decided months ago

        but that's why I wanted
            to freeze the eggs.

  <i> I'm really the practical one</i>
          <i> in the relationship.</i>

      When she goes back
     on the marketplace,

            then she can either
   get fertilized by, you know,

    a sperm donor or, you know,
              the next partner.

           <i> It's really for her.</i>

 I realize I'm not gonna get
     any credit for that

    and I'm actually fine
          with that.

Suzanne, could you
please sit down again

so we can address this
before we can move on?

Can't cancel me,
Michael.

I'm not some death row
talent show.

Oh, my God.
This is making me sick.

Please.

I'm gonna be sick.

          ( VOMITING )

 You know what?

These hormone injections
were your idea.

 You can have the credit.

 And you can have the vomit

because I am so
not cleaning that up.

          ( SOBBING )

I have to go.

        ( DOOR CLOSING )

           All right, then.

Do I really
have to clean this up?

                   I have a dog.

        <i> Â¶ Hey hey hey Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ I've been standing here Â¶</i>

      ( DOORBELL RINGING )

     <i> Â¶ Since you left me Â¶</i>

             Hi.
      Suzanne Nicholson?

    Yeah.

            Happy 40th birthday!

          Just need you to sign
                   right there.

( indistinct ) figure out
it was my birthday.

                   There you go.

Okay.
Geez, that's funny.

I just don't know who would
send me something like that.

              From your husband.

   What?

Okay, that's weird because
we've had kind of a rough week

so I'm surprised
that he would--

     It's not that weird.
     You've been served.

        <i> Â¶ Hey hey hey Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ I'm feeling too old to</i>
  <i> Still be wishing on you Â¶</i>

          <i> Â¶ Hey hey Â¶</i>

LAWYER:
<i> Look, you did sign a prenup</i>

but I'm confident
I can get you some more.

         I don't want his money.

          ( SNORTING )

                   I just-Jesus.

( PHONE RINGING IN BACKGROUND )

            I make my own money.

                    <i> That's why</i>
       <i> I'm on the tenure track</i>

    and it's not a ton of money
               but it's enough.

              I'm gonna be fine.

You can't be serious about
giving up the house, though?

          All I want is the dog.

                  And trust me,
       he's not gonna want that

               because it's not
         a frigging labradoodle

        which is what he wanted.

         I just--I swear to God
         I thought I had, like,

                you know, like,
       an M&M in here or maybe,

         like, a Hershey's Kiss
      left over from Halloween.

                       I just...

                  You know what?

           You guys should just
               serve chocolate.

                You should have
             big bowls of M&Ms.

I don't get the feeling
you're paying attention.

      Or squeeze bottles
      of Hershey syrup.

       People could just do 'em
                 like shooters.

                That would work.

  It's inhumane what you people
                are doing here.

      <i> It's like you're running</i>

          ( SPITTING )

       All right, there's lint.
         There's lint in there.

There's something
I need to tell you and--

     I thought I had a Dove Bar.

I hate that I'm the one
to have to say these words.

         Ah, you know what?
         Let me guess.

        He's sleeping with
        somebody else, right?

      MICHAEL ON PHONE:
        <i> Hey, Suzanne,</i>

        <i> I wanted you</i>
    <i> to hear this from me.</i>

     <i> I'm getting married</i>

        <i> You met her.</i>
<i> Oh, and also, she's pregnant.</i>

          <i> Okay, bye.</i>

     <i> Sherry, who's on 3?</i>
     <i> I thought we were--</i>

 When you met her, he said,

"Jessica,
I'll be with you shortly."

 And now he is.

                  Exactly right.

  She's got those fake poufy
Angelina husband-stealing lips.

Those are the lips
that launched a thousand lips.

         Ohh...

SUZANNE:<i> I tell you what the</i>
<i> worst thing about all this is.</i>

Michael ends up
being right.

I'm glad I have these
stupid frozen eggs.

 I'm always happy

when I have something
in the freezer, you know?

A bean burrito,
my genetic materials,

 it's all good.

            Right, if your life
         was a romantic comedy,

            who would your sexy
                sperm donor be?

Hm, good one.

         Oh, your dog gets sick
           and we go to the vet

        and your vet is smokin'.

        Vets are hot.
            Yeah.

Only problem is
I have a female vet

so I'd have to get
a male vet

and I've got to get him
to masturbate into a jar.

 It's very, very complicated.

Why am I smoking?

                   I don't know.

I don't even know
how to smoke.

Look at me.
I'm like a child.

I'll tell you what,
I have not smoked in 10 years.

I've not had sex with strangers
in 10 years.

And all I really want to do
is eat.

              Wow.

     KIM:<i> We don't want</i>
      <i> a live-in nanny.</i>

We want a live-in divorced lady
    and her de-balled dog.

        So where are you anyway?

       I am sitting in
my $400 baby jogger with BooBoo,

     <i> trying to teach him</i>
       <i> how to like it</i>

  so that we can go jogging
          together.

       Okay, that's it.
      You're moving in.

                Honey, I had to.

I love Suzanne.
She's family.

      I know, she's got her dog
            in a baby stroller.

          ( LAUGHING )

           SUZANNE:
  <i> We're getting a divorce.</i>

       He gets the house

  and I get the coffee shop,
           I guess.

              Wow.

I hope you guys can stay
friends, you know.

You're both
really nice people.

      ( CLEARING THROAT )

               He cheated on me.

 I never liked him.

            Wish you would have
                said something.

JAROD:
<i> I should have said something.</i>

You know what?
That's on me.

I will not let you
pay for that.

                 Jarod, I can't
            accept a free lattÃ©

        just because my husband
                 cheated on me.

Seriously, okay?
I have to redeem my gender.

Also, you have a
( CLEARING THROAT ),

 you have a little thing.

            Oh, God.

    Michael never tells me when
  I have a chocolate moustache.

      Or when he's impregnating
                his co-workers.

          ( COUGHING )

                 Sorry.

           That might have been
  more than you wanted to know.

  SUZANNE:<i> When discussing</i>
<i> the airbrushed women in ads</i> ,

  <i> my favorite quote is from</i>
  <i> Cindy Crawford who said,</i>

   <i> "Even I don't look like</i>
<i>Cindy Crawford in the morning."</i>

      In a recent survey,

      <i> 69% of women say</i>
  <i> they'd rather lose weight</i>

      <i> than fall in love</i>

            Andrea, be careful.
               Don't drop that.

            Really?

  I thought "Fragile" meant
  throw it down the stairs.

                 ( indistinct )
  It's like a Respect Festival.

It's so weird that your nanny
joined the Army.

      Oh!

              What? I know.

                  Hey, stop it.
                       Stop it.

                 Go and stop it.

              Go.

       Sophie, stay in the yard
              but away from me.

If Barnaby knocked up
some skank co-worker,

I would do to him
what the vet did to BooBoo,

only with the pliers
and a butter knife.

       Hi, this is not
       about you, okay?

                This is about me

              and how I have to
        rethink my entire life.

   Okay.

You know
what you should do?

You should finally
write a book.

             Oh.
             Yes.

    Well, you teach, like,
 how women are always trying

        to live up to
   these ridiculous images.

     You always say this.
     I have no idea why.

I'm an agent.

I think you're interesting
and I could make money.

Ooh, once again, about me.
Yay!

Okay, I don't know if
you're ready to hear this

 but I'm gonna tell you anyway.

You need just to get out there
and find yourself a real man.

     I don't want anyone to see
                my grab handles

              and my muffin top.

I would hurt a puppy
to lose weight.

 I would yell at kittens.

          ( LAUGHING )

I would skin a dolphin.

          I just-I never thought

               that I was gonna
               be dating again.

   I'm like a born again virgin.

        I don't know what to do
               on a first date.

               Do you have sex?
                  I don't know.

   No.

It's like first date,
it's like first base.

             I never knew that.
                    What is it?

                 Is that, like,
          they touch your boob?

           That's--
     No. It's not boobs.

 First base is kissing.

Okay, second base is boobs.

     I don't think that's right.

Yeah.
I mean, you know what?

And we'll check it
on Wikipedia right now.

          Yeah, you do check it
          'cause you know what?

             I bet there's been
                 sex inflation.

      It's probably boob by now.

 No. Uh-oh.

 Ah, mm-hm.

 First base is kissing.

 Boob is second base.

 Blow jobs are third.

                   What?

Oh, my God, there's
so much stuff I didn't know.

Do you know
what a grand slam is?

                    No.

Having sex four times with
the same person in one night.

             Ow.
       KIM:<i> Yeah, ow.</i>

            Jeez.
            Okay.

     Do you want to know
     what a vagumach is?

          ( GIGGLING )

     No, you need to know this.
                          What?

A vagumach is when your vagina
and your stomach meet up.

     That's what I have.
         No, you d--

           Look at my vagumach.
                        Agghhh!

 That's not a vagumach.

                I'm a vagumach.
                Do you like me?

You shut your vagumach.
That's not a vagumach.

Ooh.
And you know what?

 When you're out there,

do not let yourself
get pre-issed.

             Ohh.
      Do you wanna know?

                     Mmm.

Pre-issed is when
they stop moving.

 They just fall asleep.

          That's happened to me.

    It does happen a lot.
      I've had that one.

It saves energy though.

                  It's not good.

GREGORY:<i> So many celebrities</i>
 <i> come to me for weight loss.</i>

Please,
just sit on my balls.

This is the way
nature intended us to sit.

 There you are.

Now the key to weight loss
is within our own bodies.

You see, your mind
manufactured your fat.

            Well, no, honestly,
      I think I manufactured it

        with hormone injections
                   and M&Ms so.

( LAUGHING )
That's a very cute thing to say

but that's something
that your mind is telling you.

                No, no, I think
        it's my fat telling me.

Oh, really,
does your fat talk?

( EAST INDIAN ACCENT )
Is your fat

calling you from Mumbai
right now? Uh?

( SOUTHERN ACCENT )
Or is your fat

some good old southern
redneck cracker from Alabama

who's got nothing but time
and liquor on his hands?

( BRITISH ACCENT )
Was your fat

one of those chaps who says,
"I'm in hospital,"

instead of
"In the hospital,"

'cause it doesn't have time
to say articles

 in the middle of a word?

                   I've no idea
          what you're talking--

'Course you don't have
any idea what I'm talking about

but that's because I'm trained
in this profession.

    I am at--

       ( GONG SOUNDING )

 A homeostasis, okay?

I'm at my ideal weight
right now.

               ( LAUGHING )
               I'm sorry.

           To me--
             Hmm.

      You're just a little bit,
            not thin, you know?

             I mean, no offense.

                I don't want to
        hurt your feelings. I--

I am at my ideal weight
right now.

          But you're really not.

Okay, no, no.

What you're mistaking
for too much weight

is actually called
soft muscle.

            Okay.
    See, if I was a woman
          right now,

I wouldn't even
be able to menstruate.

My eggs would be all dry
and just refusing to come out.

That's how lean
I really am, right now.

                  Okay, I just--

You don't
have to talk anymore.

 Just lift up your shirt.

I want to talk to
that fat of yours face-to-face.

    I just don't really--
       Just lift it up.

I've seen lots of
this kind of thing.

   Oh.
   Oh, my God.

     Oh, Jesus.

I didn't expect to have
that reaction.

          I'm sorry.
        I can put it--

No, no.
No, no, it's all good.

Well, look at that,
you have a muffin top.

Hey, there,
little muffin top.

How you doing,
little muffin top?

 What you got down there?

Is that blueberries
or cranberries in there.

           Ohh!

               You know, I just
         really don't even know

       why they have to call it
                  a muffin top.

                    I just wish
    they'd call it a Satan top.

                    That's what
           it feels like to me.

Fine, fine. Satan top.
Use that.

Look, your mind
created this dis--

please, pull that down.

Your mind,
it created that disgusting

blueberry-filled
muffin top.

 It is yours to name.

                           Okay.

I want you to send in
to my lab your stool sample.

                   Eugh.

And most importantly,
I want you to begin each day

by drinking two fluid ounces
of your own urine.

                          What?
                   No. Oh, God.

          Oh, I can't, I can't,
                   I can't, no.

Now, look,
it's simple to do this.

All you do, most of my clients
they just take it,

they take the two ounces,

they dump it
in their morning lattÃ©,

just chuck it down.

Never even know
the difference.

Others make themselves
what they call a "pee tea"

and heat it in the kettle
on that stove.

Because Gandhi
drank his morning pee

every single morning.

                 Mahatma Gandhi?

Yes, and now think back to
how thin Gandhi was.

                      Okay.

Hold on.
Stay on the ball.

Now, I need you to mail me
your stool sample

<i> in this envelope.</i>

<i> It is self-sealing.</i>

Do not do as many people do
and lick it.

And this, right here,
these are your supplements.

                    SUZANNE:
                    All right.
       Okay.

               I'll do it.

It really was a pleasure
to meet you.

                     Thank you.
      It was so nice-thank you.

             I'm truly grateful.

               Oh, look, sorry.
                 I'm just not--

I would stand first,
but in my culture,

it's appropriate for women
to stand before men.

          Look, I just--I'm not
 good at the ball thing but I--

               thank you.

Thank you so much.
I'm really grateful.

       Mmm.

You will be pretty someday.

  It's our new house, buddy.
      What do you think?

   Want to give Mommy kisses?

   BooBoo, give Mommy a kiss.

      Oh, there's a kissy.

    Oh, not with the tongue.

   That's confusing to Mommy.

           Oh, yeah.

  Come on, you son of a bitch.

           Oh, Jesus.

        Here, let me.
           No, no.

    I'm so sorry.

That was so weird.
I just--

I have this thing where, like,
if I don't see it go in,

I just Gaslight myself,

like this old
black and white movie.

      Yeah, where Charles Boyer
   tries to make Ingrid Bergman

      think she's crazy.
             Yes.

    I love that movie.

  Me too.

                      I thought
          I was the only person

       who Gaslights themselves
                at the mailbox.

 I totally do that.

     It's just some stupid crap
                I have to send,

                I'm treating it
                like it's gold.

            Did it go in there?
                    Am I crazy?

 Yeah, it's just some crap.

  Thank you.

                 You're welcome.

    Morning.

     ( GIGGLING )
     See ya.

Decaf, double shot,
no foam, skinny lattÃ©

with extra room like
you asked for it three times

even though I heard you
the first time.

                 Thank you.

      Oh no, you don't.
            What?
           I-what?

JAROD:<i> I saw what you poured</i>
<i> in that.</i>

That is a decaf, non-fat,
skinny pee pee lattÃ©.

                   How on earth
             did you even know?

I run a coffee shop
in West L.A.

I see every crazy diet fad
that comes in here

and that Gregory tells people
to spend $300

to drink their own urine?

I mean, no wonder
they lose weight.

They go through the day
too disgusted to eat.

               They lose weight?

Seriously,
that's all you heard

 from what I just said?

All right, I'm gonna
make you another lattÃ©.

          Look, I--
      Oh, you know what?

               You-that's mine.
            You've-that's mine.

 Oh, sorry.

Oh, no, wait a minute.
Good news.

We ordered exactly
the same thing.

Here, here's mine.
I didn't touch it.

Take that, we're fixed.

      No, it's not fixed
     because that's mine

          and it's very special.

 No, look, it's okay.

I already put my fixings in
so you take that one

and it's a win-win.

   It's seriously not a win-win
              because it's mine

       and I just really would--

I know that we don't
know each other

but I'm just gonna
say something here.

I think I understand
what you're going through.

You are afraid of change, right?

             No.
      Of losing control,

so you fixate on the idea
of ownership of objects.

You know, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

I'm taking your lattÃ©
and I'm giving you freedom.

You're gonna thank me,
you are.

          Oh, mm-mm.

I'm tasting your freedom.

              So not my freedom
                you're tasting.

 And we are back.

Now, ladies,
I would like to ask

how you feel about
the current epidemic

of female self-mutilation
through plastic surgery.

Oh, hon, count me among
the self-mutilators.

         See my neck?
         I hated it.

        Had more rings
     than an old redwood.

         So I went in
    and had a nip tuck me

       and now I love it.

Well, Marcia,
you are an actress

and obviously
you felt pressure

 from the male-dominated media.

      No, hated my neck
        so I fixed it.

   As a transgender person,
   I've had some work done.

     Well, it's all drag
      anyway, isn't it?

         ( LAUGHING )
        Amen, sister.

             Haaa!

          Why don't you tell us
                  a little more

    what you mean when you say,
                 "It's a drag"?

      No, not "a drag."
    "Drag," men and women.

     We're all drag queens.

                             Oh.

       I mean, come on,
      no one's natural.

        <i> I don't judge</i>
       <i> anybody's drag.</i>

        True feminism should be
               complete control

   of your own body whether
   it's abortion or Botox.

I am sorry, but that is
a complete insult

to the feminist movement.

           I'm sorry.

        But do you run
    the feminist movement?

Well, my dear,
my books are all about

how the beauty oligarchy
destroys women's self-esteem.

Now I do not color my hair.

I do not wear make-up
and I will never,

ever mutilate myself
with cosmetic surgery.

            Oh, I'm sorry, dude.

   Just because you wrote a book

   automatically makes you
    the boss of all of us?

 Well, I'm sorry, dude,

but maybe because
you used to be a man

you don't understand.

                 Oh, that's it,
     play the man card with me.

         Just because
     I used to be a man,

         you're gonna use me as
 the proverbial bad guy, I see.

          You know,
       I have to say--

           Oh, mercy.

Hear that?
Cut! Cut! Cut.

          <i> 'Scuse me!</i>

             Hey.
        Closed-minded.

      Yeah, that's what
      I'm talking about.

    Unless she can hear me
'cause I'm super scared of her.

     Oh, she can just bite me.

     She can just bite me.

       Let's talk about
   something more cheerful.

     <i> Are you seeing anyone yet?</i>

     No. No.

     Come on, you know
     what they say

     about falling off
     the horse.

    You've got to get back
     in the saddle again.

      Hah!

             I keep telling her
   she just has to go out there

   and get that first time
          over with.

     I actually say
     that sex after a break-up

     is like the first waffle.

     You know, if it's no good,
              you throw it out.

     But it gets the iron ready
         for the other waffles.

     My iron is ready.

    I've been spraying it
   with non-stick hormones.

                     CHRISTINA:
    <i> This is probably different</i>

but when I first started taking
       hormone therapy,

       all of a sudden
       every man I saw

          was, like,
     ridiculously doable.

      Right.

    If I were in your shoes,

        I'd do it with
        one of the oh,

    5,000 smoking hot young men
                on that campus.

      A student?

      The simple fact is
      there is no human

             more grateful than
    a 20-something-year-old man

      you just slept with.

    Hey, I got the inside
   perspective on that one.

      Hello.

    Oh, I got a early call
    tomorrow, I should go.

      My private cell.

   If you would like a makeover
          for the first waffle,

     it's on me.

      Thank you.

                          Yeah!
    Waffles for all my friends!

    Oh, hon, I don't think
    this drinking thing's

    gonna work out for you.

      Hey, sure.

     I've never been
     drunk before ever.

    My cheeks are so numb.
    Are they turning pink?

              KIM: I found this
         awesome dating service

      called "It's Just Drinks."

You're not serious?

                         It is,
            "It's Just Drinks."

        Terrible idea.
      It's a great idea.

    I already signed us up
    and paid for us both.

We are not doing it.
You are married.

Look, I just want to check out
what my current market value is

           when I'm not driving
           a minivan covered in

       "My Little Pony"
       stickers, okay?

                   And Barnaby,
       he's super cool with it.

Oh, I'm sure
he's very cool, yeah.

 He is super cool with anything
          that gets me to shave

      above the knee, all right?

 Oh, well,
 that I could believe.

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

     So let's mix, mingle
and remember, it's just drinks.

            Ha, ha.

You're a car salesman,
that's awesome.

Good for you.

              What will it take
           for you to say "Yes"

            to sleeping with me
                       tonight?

          ( LAUGHING )

                           <i> Huh?</i>

          ( LAUGHING )

Well, I don't know.
How about a tsunami?

MAN:<i> So in addition to running</i>
     <i> my own hedge fund,</i>

 I am also a plushie.

      I don't know what that is.

Oh, I like to dress
in a furry pink rabbit suit

that has a hole cut into it
for my genitalia.

                       Hah!

                  Must get cold.

          <i> What are you driving</i>
                   <i> these days?</i>

I'm driving a Ford.
I got to go.

       I'll-thank you.
   Suzanne sounds European.

                  You should be
             in a European car.

                I'm just saying.

 Well, thank you.

I'll call you in three years
when my visa's up, okay.

 Thank you.

         So, how was
     "It's Just Drinks"?

It was just horrible.

 Oh, oh.

             I love you so much.

    And please, please, please,
           don't ever leave me.

    Don't ever make me go.
           I won't.

              Oh.

 She shaved her legs.

        I did. I did.
        Both of them.

          ( KISSING )

 I'm happy for you.

BARNABY:
<i> I'll take it.</i>

         ( KISSING )
       <i> Mmm, thank you.</i>

           SUZANNE:
   <i> You were at my wedding.</i>

<i> You could have said something.</i>

            LINDA:
    <i> What am I gonna say?</i>

        <i> Great dress.</i>
     <i> Run for your life?</i>

         Besides, you loved him.

  I know.

                  You know what?

          I am gonna fix you up
     with a genuinely good guy.

             Ohh.
         No, no, no.

       This guy's new professor
             to the department.

                 He's divorced.
                   He's lovely.

         It's not on.
        He's luh-vely.

                Trust me.

         I am very good at this.

    And besides, he couldn't be
 worse than the guy you picked.

 You know what?

I just wish I could stop
thinking about them

all the time.
It's all I think about.

                 Hi.

 Oh.

         Um, you know, I always
         really did admire you.

 When I was an undergraduate,
 I actually took your class.

Then you took my husband.

            Ha, ha.

           No, no.
      Whoa, whoa, whoa.

           Hey, hey.

             Cut it out.

       ( PHONE RINGING )

Hello?
Yeah, no, I'm good.

       Did that actually happen?

              No.

          ( LAUGHING )

 In my head, it happened.

          ( LAUGHING )

           Well, it should have.

     <i> Â¶ I don't know why</i>
   <i> He does these things Â¶</i>

Listen, people usually go out
for coffee on a first date

 but you and I have had coffee,

 like, a ridiculous
 amount of times.

Plus, I saved you
from drinking your own pee,

<i> which I think</i>
<i> should count for something.</i>

So I was wondering...

could I cook dinner
for you at my place?

            Yeah.
            <i> Okay.</i>

                        <i> Yeah.</i>

       Good.

   KIM [ON PHONE]:<i> So when</i>
<i>did Jarod start serving waffles</i>

     <i> in that coffee shop?</i>

      <i> Mmm, first waffle.</i>

           Shut up.
KIM:<i> He's, like, what? Twelve?</i>

 No, I think he's 30.

  KIM:<i> And I can't believe</i>
  <i> you are going to a tranny</i>

      <i> for a sex makeover.</i>

        <i> Where's Jarod</i>
     <i> taking you anyway?</i>

 He's making me dinner.

             KIM:
   <i> In his Easy-Bake oven?</i>

       <i> That is so cute.</i>

            Shut up.

          ( LAUGHING )

     Now quality lingerie
    is to 40-year-old sex

 what MI semiautomatic rifles
        were to D-Day.

         What?

        You can't go in unarmed
     and you can't go in naked.

             Oh.
    I love war analogies.

           I get it.

           Okay. Men.

It's all about
the hair and the boobs.

So whatever you can do
to get your hair big, do it.

            Okay.
   Now, as for the boobs--

            Yeah.
      Same as the hair.

Men like big boobs.

  They can never be too big.
            Right.

    And since you're gonna
    keep your bustier on,

                    we're gonna
            kick it up a notch.

         ( LAUGHING )
         With these.

           Oh, my God.

       Chicken cutlets.
          Hold that.

Let me get
these girls in here.

  Hello, mama.

             Wow.
           I know.

           Ooh, cold.

Ah, I know it's cold,
honey, but look.

 Bam!

Maximum firepower
right there.

   Wow.

                 Now the reason
       I got you in shapewear--

            Yeah.
 Is to boost your confidence.

              Ohh.

You don't like
your tummy or your thighs

so we're gonna
direct him up here

        to the girls.
            Right.

       Yo, and the most
       important part.

         Here you go.
         Spread 'em.

<i> There's a pee flap</i>
<i> pull-out.</i>

Check it out.
Okay.

 It's very handy.

It's like a puppet.

Hello, I'm old and desperate.

Okay, so if the clothes
are gonna come off--

            Okay.
     Go in the bathroom.

You lose the shapewear.

You've got your underpants
on so you're good.

                   Right, right.

You check your teeth,
you fluff your hair bigger.

Yeah. And you're gonna be
good to go.

                   Oh, I dunno.
        It's a lot to remember.

              I just don't feel
            like I can do this.

   Well, of course, you can
      and you know what?

         I made you a checklist.

Do not, I repeat,
do not take off the heels

and do not
take off the bustier.

 What if he asks me to?

 You tell him no.

Believe me, it's not
a deal-breaker for him.

                       Bam.

            JAROD:
    <i> You're really pretty.</i>

            JAROD:
 <i> Do you mind if I say that?</i>

  No.

Oh, I-sorry, I have to,

uh, just have to go
to the bathroom.

           Oh. Okay.
           It's right there.

Need to take my purse
for girlie stuff.

        Take your purse.

                    I'll just--
              just two seconds.

                    Sorry.

          I got it.

   It's a Bumpit.
   It's a hair thing.

 It's for making my hair big.

 Oh. Thank you.

        I'm so sorry.
 Cool. It's like a hair toy.

         That's fine.
         It's weird.

       It's not weird.
       It's all right.

    No! No.

                           Okay.

           I'm sorry.

 Is that weird?

       I would rather--
  It's fine. No, I like it.

           Really?
         Yeah, yeah.

          I mean, it's actually
              pretty cool but--

              it's kind of nice.

                      It just--
             it freaked me out.

              a middle aged man

          wants a Mercedes Benz.

           So what do you think?

You had me at
"I'm getting liposuction."

           SUZANNE
   <i> Did you get my message?</i>

<i> I just want to do the Angelina</i>
 <i> husband-stealing lip pouf.</i>

                 All right.

       I read this in Wikipedia.

           You can take the fat
        that you are gonna take

       directly out of my butt--

           DOCTOR:
           <i> Uh-hm.</i>

             And you can put it
                  into my lips.

         So people can actually
                   kiss my ass.

          ( LAUGHING )

Okay, so what's happening now
is the meds are kicking in.

                I feel good.

I can see that.
That's wonderful.

You know, we're not
gonna have this conversation,

       though, about--
  Can we please just do it?

                      I'm here.
     No, we can't please do it.

          I will give you money.

We're not gonna have the
conversation about, you know,

what procedures
we're gonna do or not gonna do.

<i> We're not gonna do that</i>
<i> right now.</i>

         ( CRYING ):
        Did I tell you

        that the woman
        that stole my husband

        has those lips, those--
             they're beautiful.

       Okay.

I'm gonna give you
a temporary injection

into your lips of saline.

That is going to give you
the pouf
that you're talking about.

          Thank you.
       It's temporary.

          Is that my fat?

DOCTOR:<i> It is your fat, yes.</i>
         SUZANNE:<i> Ahh!</i>

DOCTOR:<i> Say goodbye.</i>
<i> Wave goodbye to your fat.</i>

    SUZANNE:<i> It's yellow.</i>
      DOCTOR:<i> Yes, it is.</i>

      It's like butter.
            Yeah.

       Which is perfect because
         that's where I got it.

DOCTOR:
<i> Mm-hm.</i>

              Can I keep my fat?

              Can I keep it?

Suzanne,
if you sign a release,

I will give you your fat.

                  Oh, thank you.

   'Cause, God knows,
   it is your fat.

          Thank you.
          Thank you.

Yeah, keep your hands down.

                 That face mask
        looks so pretty on you.

               Do not drop that.

         It's my fat.
          All right.

           I made it.

             I know you made it.

              And you know what?

  Do we need to bring it inside?

                      I don't--
                    no, no, no.

            Aghh!

               Okay, you did it.

              Yay, you!

                     All right,
       let's just get this off.

                Okay, there.

      All right, can you just--
    no, just help a little bit.

                   All right.

         Okay.

Okay, oh, wow, okay,
that's convenient, huh?

 Yeah. Lucky you.

All right.
Oh, okay, there you go.

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

I can do it,
I can do it.

                        I know,
         you're high as a kite.

           Come here.

                   I'm so tired.

 I know you're tired.

                      Get in it.

At that New Year's Eve party,

did you or did you not
sleep with John Brady?

                  <i> Uh-huh? Yeah.</i>

       I knew it.

 I got to call Marilyn.

                      I knew it.

         KIM:<i> Hey,</i>
 <i> Suzanna-ranna-danna-banana.</i>

   <i> Time to get up, lipohead.</i>

           <i> Come on.</i>

           Hey, Suze.

Did you forget you're speaking
on a panel today?

 Morning.

Oh, God.

 Honey, you got to get up here.

Okay, we got
a slight problem.

Just a slight problem,
but don't worry.

I called the doctor
and she said that it's
just an allergic reaction

to the lidocaine
in the saline solution.

And that you don't need to
worry about a thing

  because it's gonna go down.

What's gonna go down?

It's gonna go down.

           Oh, my God!

         What happened?

Eventually, I mean, not today,
     but it will go down.

           It will.
          ( CRYING )

    No, don't panic,
    though, honey.

         Don't panic.
         Don't panic.

      We can fix this.

 Accessories.

            What?
             Yes.

             No.
It's all about accessorizing.

        Okay, here. Huh?

        What? Hey.

  Oh, is that the croc hunter?

        No, okay, look.

          Oh, my God.
         There. Huh?

That's-it's stupid.

 It draws the eyes upwards.

          <i> I got it.</i>
   <i> Here we go, here we go.</i>

   Look at this,
   look at this, huh?

       What? Huh?

I don't want to
( indistinct ).

  No one's gonna say anything.

    It's racist if they did.

           <i> Hello.</i>
      What's she do to me?

       She said it was
   only gonna be temporary.

 No, it is temporary.

It's just-actually,
I just want you to shut up.

Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

            Linda, we're having
   a little nip tuck situation.

 Didn't you get my message?

          No, what?
      Remember that guy,

that new professor
I was gonna set you up with?

            Yeah.
          He's here.

         Oh, my God.
      He's on the panel.

   No, please don't say that.

                Oh, no, no, no.
   Just don't talk, don't talk.

It's a panel.
She has to talk.

Don't know why
it itches so much.

             Okay, honey, okay.
                     Calm down.

             MAN:
    <i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

       <i> please welcome</i>
     <i> Dr. Cameron Scott.</i>

Cameron Scott,
this is Suzanne.

                     Oh, my God.

        CAMERON SCOTT:
        <i> Jane Austen,</i>

arguably the most widely read
 English novelist in history,

    never actually put her name
          on her work because--

             writing novels was
  considered vulgar as a woman.

  Every single one of her books
       was published as simply,

                    "By a lady."

Suzanne,
what are your thoughts?

          ( LAUGHING )

        Women writers have been
            completely ignored.

          ( LAUGHING )

         Cut it out.
            What?

          I'm really not
          trying to be funny.

                   I just--

           Stop it.
  Why is everybody laughing?

     <i> Â¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else Â¶</i>

  <i> Â¶ I only wanna be myself Â¶</i>

           SUZANNE:
 <i> The personal is political.</i>

       <i> Can a feminist</i>
    <i> get plastic surgery?</i>

     <i> To me, feminism means</i>
  <i> I'm in charge of all my own</i>
 <i> decisions about my own body,</i>

     <i> even the stupid ones.</i>

          ( LAUGHING )

This is two pounds
of my liposucted ass fat.

          ( GROANING )

<i> I know, gross.</i>

And I also had
a temporary lip pouf,

which, thank God,
has gone away.

I've spent my entire
academic career

  studying pop culture

and, as of last week,
I became pop culture.

          ( LAUGHING )

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

            WOMAN:
            <i> Ooh.</i>

   SUZANNE:<i> Internet video</i>
    <i> has made it possible</i>

      <i> for anyone to be</i>
   <i> a celebrity overnight.</i>

  <i> More people watched this</i>
 <i> adorable dancing Pomeranian</i>

<i> than watched the network news.</i>

   <i> And more people saw me</i>
        <i> than the dog.</i>

Which means
that my humiliation

was actually bigger news
than the news.

  <i> When you are going viral,</i>
      <i> you have no idea.</i>

 <i> You're just living your life,</i>

 Awesome.

                    No, Andrea,
             it is not awesome.

      That isn't the definition
                  of "awesome."

               The Grand Canyon

     Go clean your room.
    Go read a dictionary.

         I hate you.
            Good.

    That's what I was going for.

      You know, Suzanne,
I found this in your room and--

         ( GIGGLING )
    I was just wondering,

         is there something
         you want to tell me?

You know what?
It's a weight loss device.

             Oh, it is? Look at
        how skinny I'm getting.

Oh, stop it.
Just stop it.

      ( PHONE RINGING )
        I will. Fine.

     Oh, hang on.

 Oh, God.

It's Hayes, my attorney,
we're closing this thing.

Hi.

<i> What?</i>

Are you kidding me? Oh my--

          What? What did he say?

                What did he say?

After I gave on the 401(k)?
Are you kidding me?

                           What?

Look, listen,
I have an agent here.

Hang on one second.

Michael wants his fancy
blender back and,

if he doesn't get it back,
he's gonna go for dog custody.

         He cannot have BooBoo.
            We will fight this.

         ( WHIMPERING )

SUZANNE:
<i> Okay.</i>

He says that for sure,
he would get half-time custody.

You know what?
Hayes, fine, screw it.

Just close it.
Let him have it.

 He's not getting my dog.

Thanks.

<i> I can't believe it.</i>

                     I will get
            the blender to him.

      I'll make sure he gets it.

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

                     Hi.

              Hi.

I knew you were
gonna cheat on me.

                   What?

                      Oh.

                   ( LAUGHING )
      Yeah, I did cheat on you.

       Listen, I'm really sorry.

I get it.
I get it. I get it.

We're not gonna date.

But I wanted to say
I'm sorry, though,

for that scene
with my mom.

                  Oh, well--

You know,
she's very dramatic.

And she's an actress,
so what are you gonna do?

 I really enjoyed it.

        You.

                  Me too.

I thought so, you know,

based on your reaction
at the time.

            Yeah.
         ( LAUGHING )

        I don't see why
        we can't be friends.

     Plus, you must be jonesing
            for a decent lattÃ©.

       I mean, no other barista
 can satisfy you the way I can.

                   That is true.

True.
Thank you very much.

 And thank you.

         Okay, look.
 I don't care what it costs.

It has to be delivered upright
and only to Michael Nicholson.

 It's a very special package
  for a very special person.

          Enjoy, you douche bag.

      And Marcia Wallace
called again, like, five times.

           Really?
            Yeah.

I'm just gonna email her.

          Okay, but you did get
       a big bouquet of flowers

from the Cheswick Fair Magazine

                saying congrats
            on the viral video.

 What's that about?

                  I don't know,
          but they're gorgeous.

 Wow.

                      Oh, also,
          Michael called again.

       He sounded really pissed.

                     Ohh! Jesus.

       ( PHONE RINGING )

          ( LAUGHING )

                  Hi.

         You are sick, Suzanne.
    You need professional help.

   I'll have you know

 I've taken out
 a restraining order.

             So did Michael get
       his little gift package?

 Yeah. Good one, Kim.

He's filing a restraining

And, uh-uh,
I have bigger problems

<i> than you provoking my ex.</i>

            Yeah.

                       I almost
          didn't recognize you.

 Without my crazy clown lips?

          ( LAUGHING )

         I do like these better.

           I just wanted to say
                    I'm sorry--

 I'm really sorry and I--

         ( BOTH LAUGH )

            Sorry.
I guess that's taken care of.

                   Listen...

       I was wondering if you'd
   like to have dinner with me.

    Uh, insert lame excuse here.

          Sorry?

       Men always make
       some lame excuse

         for why they're asking
  a pretty woman out to dinner.

         Like, seeing that it's
  a solar eclipse or something.

          ( GIGGLING )

                   So I thought
        I'd maximize my chances

               and let you pick
               the lame excuse.

  But pick something persuasive.

                    I'd love to
           spend time with you.

Yes.
I-yeah, I'd love to.

           Really?
            Yeah.

                  Great.

              When are you free?

Are you parked
under this building?

                      Yes.

Okay, this is gonna sound
really weird.

But I'm being stalked
by a sitcom star

and I could really
use a ride.

       I hate when that happens.

          ( LAUGHING )

              Sure, let's go.

             I don't know where
                  but let's go.

    Yeah.

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

           CAMERON:
            <i> Wow.</i>

You'll do a lot to get away
from a beloved TV icon

 whose kids you've shagged.

                He's not a kid.
                  He's-he's 22.

                       Oh, God,
       why did I tell you that?

I'm glad you did.

I'm going to get
a lot of mileage out of that.

                        Really?
        Is that what you think?

It's what I hope.

 What I'm wondering is,

if I'm the rebound guy
from the rebound guy,

 what are my chances?

          How scary is your mom?

 She's five feet.

You can take her.

          ( LAUGHING )

                Then we're good.

 I just had a great idea.

                      What?

How do you feel
about weddings?

                    Oh, God.

   Kind of like how boat people
              feel about boats.

It's just that tomorrow
I'm supposed to go to

my ex-wife's new husband's
pregnant daughter's wedding.

            Jeez.
     And I was wondering

 if you'd want to be my date.

                     Mmm, no.

 You can meet
 my whole crew,

including my snarly
body-sprayed teenage son, Ian.

             That sounds deeply
                   unappealing.

      I just really don't think
                  I want to go.

My divorce is
ridiculously friendly.

And my ex-wife's new husband
worries that I'm lonely.

                     Oh, my God.

        Well, I guess you think
    that just because I'm naked

           I'm the kind of girl
      you can take to a wedding

               on a second date.

              But the thing is,
     I don't even have anything

           to wear at a wedding.

The bride
is eight months gone.

Trust me,
it's not that formal.

                  Okay.

                  Fine, I'll go.

           I'll go.

         <i> He's so nice.</i>

       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

         ( SQUEALING )

      ( MUSIC CONTINUING )

It's just great how you all
are so friendly with each other.

   Cameron moved to Boston
when I had some business there.

    Trevor's a big success
   in the profit business.

    And so Ruth and I came here
 when he got his professorship.

<i> It's better for Ian, you know,</i>
        <i> if we're all together.</i>

             Oh.
         IAN:<i> Yeah.</i>

This wedding is so gay.

           CAMERON:
      <i> In this instance,</i>

        gay means lame.

 Dad, no one says lame.

    Lame is gay.

       RUTH:<i> So sorry,</i>
    <i> he's being dreadful.</i>

       CAMERON:<i> I have to keep</i>
              <i> reminding myself</i>

                 my sweet boy's
            in there somewhere.

You're an actually nice man,
aren't you?

                I think so.

           Is that unattractive?

  No.

          ( LAUGHING )

      What we have to do now is
   to find someone for Cameron,

                     <i> you know,</i>
       <i> so that he doesn't feel</i>

   <i> like such a third wheel</i>
<i>when we go on holiday together.</i>

( LAUGHING ) You all go
on holiday together, I see.

       Trevor has a private jet.

       No, no, I just lease one.

                <i> Does the trick.</i>

      Wouldn't it be wonderful,
                       darling,

        if these two, you know,
               made a go of it?

          ( LAUGHING )

       Yes.

    How long's it been, Cameron?

       Forty-four hours
      and nine minutes.

          ( LAUGHING )

                   Right, right.

                 Well, probably
         a bit early to say yet

      but here's to the success.

      Here's to success.
          Thank you.

 No pressure.

( LAUGHING )
Yeah.

It's really just
almost scary

how nice you people are
to each other.

                 Well, the fact
    that there's been a divorce

    doesn't mean to say there's
  got to be any unpleasantness.

     Really?

That was not my experience.

Suzanne, I knew
I'd find you here.

 Yeah, every afternoon.

Yeah, it's kind of
our secret spot.

          So don't tell anybody
                     I told you

        but we had your initial
                 tenure hearing

      and Deborah wants you out.

 What?

            ELISE:
  <i> This can't be happening.</i>

Are you serious?
You're not--

      Yeah, I'm serious
      as a vampire bite,

           you are
            O-U-T.

She's my mentor.
This can't be happening.

            She's really pissed
            that you got a lipo

        and did a lecture on it.

What about my, you know,
the personal is political?

     That's how I teach.
   That's what she teaches.

            She says you're not
               a real feminist.

             Oh.
            What?

   Yeah, we vote on Friday.
   She is gunning for you.

      This is just like
 when we were in high school

   and all the popular kids
 went on the big senior trip

      but we stayed home
     because we didn't go

      and then we looked
       at the yearbook

and we were, like, "Oh, my God,
that looked like so much fun,

  I wish we would have gone."

  But then the popular kids
          were like,

    "You should have gone.
 I mean, it was so much fun."

      But if we'd gone,
we would have just gotten hives

     and would have gone
       to the hospital.

   Don't you see,
   that's what this is?

        No, it's about the lipo.

         <i> You know what she says</i>

             about the surgical
           mutilation of women.

                    Look, I got
            a breast reduction.

            What?
  'Cause they were too big.

          I had to.
   I stuff my bra for work.

     <i> No one knows.</i>

 I wouldn't have known.

  You stuff your bra for work?

      Okay, stop looking at 'em.

         Yes, ma'am.
   And keep it to yourself.

 We'll say nothing.

 Thank you.

      Sorry, girl.

 Thank you.

       They look so real.

I never knew.
I never knew.

 She's enormous breasts, still.

 It's crazy.

       RECORDER VOICE:
       <i> Call incoming.</i>

        <i> Unknown caller.</i>

 Hello?

Hi, I'm calling
for Peter Durton.

 Did you get the flowers?

( LAUGHING )
Why, yes.

But I have no idea why.

They're from Peter.

<i> He's in town</i>
<i> for the Oscars</i>

and he would like to
set up a drinks with you

at his private screening room

to discuss a book deal
through his publishing arm.

I'm sorry,
do I know you?

( LAUGHING )
Not me.

Peter Durton, the editor
of Cheswick Fair Magazine.

He also does books.

He rents a private
screening room

to watch the nominated films.

He has a suite
at the Peninsula

but it always gets him
depressed.

So and he can't possibly
watch the movies

on a regular television,
oh, that's a nightmare.

Anyway, can you do
Tuesday at 4?

I'm sorry,
how does he even know me?

From the Internet,
obviously.

Congrats on that,
by the way.

 Hence the flowers.

        Ah.

Tuesday at 4.
We'll see you.

   I'm so glad you came by.
   Can you stay for dinner?

            Maybe.
            Yeah.

                     What a day.

She was my mentor,
you know?

I was counting on this.

      Well, you've got alimony,
                  I'm guessing.

       No.

We had a prenup
and I didn't fight it

'cause I didn't really
want to get paid by somebody

to not have sex with them,
you know?

                 That's ethical.

      I admire that but clearly
            you need more wine.

      Clearly.

I dunno, maybe
this Peter Durton thing

will turn out to be
something.

                   You're going?

Yeah.

You're not upset,
are you?

           Date anyone you like.

 It's not a date, okay?

His assistant said
it's drinks.

                 In his private
                 screening room

             because he's bored
     of his luxury hotel suite.

          It sounds like a date.

             Lunch is a meeting.

     Drinks in a screening room
                     is a date.

Please tell me that
you are trying to be funny.

           No, I'm dead serious.

       But then again, I'm just
  the rebound from the rebound.

          There's a whole world
                     out there.

I just-- I thought
you were the nice guy.

               Is it not Monday?

                      No, it is.

        Good to see you, buddy.
          You remember Suzanne.

  Hi.

                Oh, yeah, sure.
                   Hi, I guess.

                 Is she staying
                    for dinner?

 No. No, I can't.

Thanks.
I have to go actually.

 Thank you, though.

We can talk later, right?

                Yeah, I'll give
                    you a call.

                       Bye, Ian.

 Later.

        ( DOOR CLOSING )

                That looked gay.

                  What happened?

She has a date
with a billionaire

who has a screening room.

                     That sucks.

Yeah. That it does.

        I can't believe Deborah
        wants to give you the ax
        because you had lipo

           when it's so obvious
           that she's had Botox

           and her hair colored.

Really?
How do you know that?

            The same way I know
                 you had Botox.

God, like,
how do you even--

        I am like CSI of beauty.

             <i> I know everything.</i>

     Mm.

       Is there a night
  where Deborah doesn't book

     any events at school?

<i> Yeah, tonight.</i>

That's her "me" time.

                     <i> Oh, I bet.</i>

              Well, we're going
           on a beauty stakeout

    'cause she's a goddamn
hypocritical skank in call "O."

I've no idea
what you're talking about.

         Just trust me.

         <i> We're gonna</i>
   <i> blackmail her bony ass.</i>

       ( STEALTHY MUSIC )

        ( DOOR OPENING )

Get her.
Film it.

    ( WHISPERING ) My God.
     That's Dr. Delaney.

        She's the one
      that did my lipo.

( WHISPERING ) Yeah. She's the
best in ( indistinct ) Botox.

          Ha, ha, ha.

          All right,
        let's go look.

Yeah, let's go.
I'll film it.

       Okay, you film it.

                     What is it?

          Botox. God.

   Aging gratefully, my ass.

                     She's such
                   a hypocrite.

        Ho, ho, ho, ho.

                      You know,
            I can't wait to see

                       the look
           on her Botoxed face.

     We are gonna nail her.

                 We already did.

        You're a genius.

The March issue
closes today.

    You need to understand
Peter's time is very valuable.

       Oh, don't call him Peter.

What do I call him?

                    Nothing.

          If he asks you to say
      something to him, say it.

             Otherwise, no name.

Okay, no names.

        And don't look
        at the house.

    It belongs to someone
     ridiculously famous.

       Do not look at the house.

     You can see but don't look.

           And if he offers you
      something to eat, eat it,

                 even if you're
          allergic or whatever.

                  We'll get you
             medical attention.

                He's very proud
                   of his food.

               Watch your step.
                    Don't look.

 Okay, I'm not looking.

Jeez.

          ( GROWLING )

                     I'm Peter.
         You can call me Peter.

              We need champagne.

                   You like Dom?

You know, actually,
I never had it.

           This is the good Dom.

 There's bad Dom?

     There's regular Dom
        which is good.

           Uh-huh.
  Then there's the good Dom.

 Thank you.

          ( INHALING )

Oh, my God.
Oh, that's nuts.

 That's, like, amazing.

         Told you so.
            Yeah.

                So, I want you,
        to write a book for me.

   Oh.

              Angelique, cheese.

          ( INHALING )

                            Mmm.

           You'll do good media.

          I'm into thin slicing.

I don't know
what that is actually.

            It's snap judgments
         based on my instincts.

Oh.

  I didn't even need to see
   your whole viral video.

                      I get you.

                    He gets you.

           <i> He gets you without</i>
             <i> listening to you.</i>

      That's why he's so genius.

His genius is that
he doesn't listen?

                       He hears
             without listening.

               Anyway, the book
      is called "F the F-Word."

     Discreet against feminists.

        With you naked
        on the cover.

    Oh!

      Not nips and pubes
      naked, obviously.

       Nobody wants to
        see you naked.

Feminists suck.
Totally agree.

                        Me too.
                   ( LAUGHING )

You know, I have to say,
I don't totally agree

because I wouldn't actually
call myself a feminist.

And that's kind of
important to me.

           Right, right, right.
              Yeah, yeah, yeah.

                Really, for me,
           it's about the cover

          and the media message.

         You should really have
           some of this cheese.

                Comes from cows
     that have had better lives

               than most people.

I, uh, you know, I will--

       Eat it.

 I will try it.

I just, you know, I will
take this offer very seriously.

It's very tempting.
I--

Mmm, mmm.

 Oh, my God.

                    That's what
             I'm talking about.

That's cheese?
That's, like, amazing.

           That's--
     Don't say yes or no.

    First of all, we're talking
       significant six figures.

                <i> Second of all--</i>

            Mm-hm?
    <i> Just think about it.</i>

          BTW, I want you to be
      my plus-one at the Oscars

and the magazine's party after.

         ( STAMMERING )

        We'll give you clothes,
   you know, hair/make-up team.

           Yeah, we'll make you
                    look great.

           Well, better, anyway.

<i> Sorry, are you--</i>

I mean, are you talking
about the Oscar Oscars?

'Cause that's crazy.
I'm not that kind of person.

                         Great.
                  She'll do it.

            Perfect.

             I've got to scoot.
       I've got another drinks.

 This, will be great.

           DEBORAH:
      <i> This is pathetic.</i>

     You guys aren't cops.

    You can't blackmail me
 with DNA evidence of Botox.

My doctor isn't gonna violate
doctor/patient confidentiality

 so this is just really stupid.

      And the very fact
      you even tried it

           tells me
 that my instincts about you

    were right on, Suzanne.

        You are so out.

          CHRISTINA:
     <i> But unfortunately,</i>

  there's no hairdresser/client
               confidentiality.

 Oh, right.

Your hairdresser,

 Rafael, she knows him.

               And you go on TV,

<i> bragging how you</i>
<i> don't dye your hair</i>

        when Rafael says you do
                tops and tails,

      but you're a lousy tipper,

         which is a big mistake
                   for somebody

    who expects confidentiality
            from her pube dyer.

 We're gonna make

             a video with Rafael

                and we're gonna
             link it to Suzie's

 fat lip video,

      and everybody's gonna see,

 <i> just what a hypocrite you are.</i>

                And we're gonna
           Auto-tune your pubes,

              which is not good
                 for book deals

                or "Today Show"
                   appearances.

                 Think about it.

 You should think about it.

                 You nailed it.
              You were amazing.

  Well, I can't imagine her
      fighting you now.

( PHONE RINGING IN BACKGROUND )

    God, I hate hypocrites.

         I thought we were just
   gonna bust her on the Botox,

              then you whip out
          Auto-tuning her pubes.

          ( LAUGHING )

       My God, that was perfect.

Honestly, I can't even
believe you would stay here.

I mean, that woman
represents

everything that's wrong
with the movement.

                I know. I agree.

       ( PHONE RINGING )

                    Oh, hang on.

        It's Cameron.
     He keeps calling me,

       and I don't want
       to talk to him.

      ( PHONE RINGING )
      He was just awful,

               about that whole
            Peter Durton thing.

      I think you should
      answer the phone.

       ( PHONE RINGING )

       You know, I know
   it's none of my business

       but I feel like
 I got to tell you something.

Peter Durton is a dick.

I slept with him
as a girl, years ago.

                       Wow.

Then you tell me about
this nice guy Cameron

who's all freaked out
about this rich guy

and, I mean,
what the hell.

Why is he freaked out
about it anyway?

Wait a sec, why am I freaking
about it?

Maybe I'm just jealous.

You know, it takes
a very unusual sort of man

to even want to consider
being with me.

I just, you know,

 I would take a nice, normal,

slightly insecure guy
any day.

       RECORDER VOICE:
       <i> Call incoming.</i>

         You answered.

     Hi.

              Hi.

        Have you ever
        seen the film,

           "Harvey"
     with Jimmy Stewart?

   It's where Jimmy Stewart
      honestly believes

       he's got a friend,

        <i> who's a giant</i>
  <i> invisible talking rabbit.</i>

Yeah, I know the movie.

     It's just my ex, Ruth,

          she left me.

 <i> Trevor's a great guy and all</i>

        <i> but they knew</i>
      <i> each other before</i>

         and I guess
  I'm a little wrapped tight

    when it comes to women
I care about and billionaires.

 I'm sorry.

<i> I don't know</i>
<i> what that has to do</i>

<i> with a giant talking</i>
<i> rabbit, though.</i>

        Because I was
    having a conversation

with someone who wasn't there:
            Ruth.

     Because she left me
       for a rich guy.

I get it.

           I'm sorry.

     I probably came off
    as crazy and jealous.

          <i> I'm sorry.</i>

       <i> I was wondering,</i>

     if maybe, you wanted
     to come over Sunday

      and we could watch
     the Oscars together.

I'm actually
going to the Oscars

 with that Peter guy.

     Wow, he's taking you
        to the Oscars.

He gave me
that book deal.

        That's great.
      I'm happy for you.

 Maybe we could--

   Sure, just give me a call.

 I'll call you.

     <i> I should let you go.</i>

           All right.

          All right,
   good luck with all that.

           All of it.

       RECORDED VOICE:
<i> Message from Marcia Wallace.</i>

          <i> Hi, doll.</i>
 <i> You never returned my call.</i>

        <i> I over-reacted.</i>

    <i> I just wanted to say</i>
         <i> I'm sorry.</i>

   <i> It's just that sometimes</i>

 <i> it's hard to take the bear</i>
   <i> out of the momma bear.</i>

        <i> I was wrong.</i>
         <i> I'm sorry.</i>

Look, I hate to harsh
your whole princess trip here

but I just read through
the book contract

 from Peter Durton.

And, as your literary agent,
I have to tell you,

which I hate to tell you
because it is so much money

and I love money,
but it is the worst deal ever.

                     What? Why?

           What's wrong with it?

It's indentured servitude
with better outfits.

I mean, seriously,
you have no creative rights.

 He basically owns you.

He tells you
exactly what to write.

I mean, granted,
for a lot of money

and, seriously,
better outfits.

They literally
have the right to dress you.

                    What?

It's like
you're Author Barbie.

     All right, well, you know,
 we'll just negotiate with him.

I doubt it.

Look, you feel free

to stay here
as long as you want

and to write a book
that is actually good,

which I believe
that I can sell.

 All right?

You know, granted
there's no guarantees but--

                   I can't keep
          living here for free.

You keep doing
my grocery shopping

and you can stay here
forever.

And you have to play
Candy Land

with Sophie
any time she asks.

   I love playing Candy Land.

        I'm good at it.

Okay, well, seriously,
there's no strategy.

You just pick and what you get
is what you get.

           I mean--
             No.

       When I play it,
      there's strategy.

Oh, really?
You know how to, like--

     I'm not telling you.
         Okay, fine.

           All right.

REPORTER:<i> Welcome, everybody,</i>
<i> to the Oscars Red Carpet or,</i>

        <i> as I know it,</i>
   <i> the Prom of the World,</i>

     <i> where I get to feel</i>
<i> like a buck-toothed wallflower</i>

        without a date.

              You look fabulous.

  Those hair and make-up people
           are miracle workers.

             Right.

           BTW, Peter wanted me
              to show you this.

           You're gonna love it.

    You are our new star author.

                Congratulations.

Okay, but this is not me.

                 But it will be.

            You should be proud.

     Peter normally only spends
          $10,000 on retouching

                  but he wanted
              to fix everything

        that was wrong with you,

              so he put $15,000
                    towards it.

             I--
       You look great.

I should be proud--

                      Mm-hm.

That it cost $15,000
to make me presentable--

            Yeah.
        As an author.

             It's a compliment,
                     obviously.

 Obviously.

 I just need a lattÃ©.

             We don't have time.

 Hi, new star author.

 I say we do.

I am out of here.

Wait.
Where are you going?

         You have to bring back
     the dress and those shoes.

 Have fun at the Oscar.

    Should bring 'em back
     dry cleaned as well.

      <i> It's kind of funny.</i>

Michael bought this same exact
coffee maker for our house

and I wanted
to be a good wife,

so I learned
how to use it.

Michael, being Michael,

he prefers
having coffee out

so, I've noticed lately

that you're kind of
short-handed around here

so I was wondering
if you would consider hiring me.

This is a good lattÃ©.
What do you think?

                     Yeah, sure.

             Yes?
         Yeah, sure.

Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

 I will take the job,

because, I need a day job

because I'm gonna try
to write a book.

                That's awesome.
           I'm so proud of you.

Thanks, boss.

So we'll talk
about this tomorrow.

I have to go.

It's a very long story.

          Thank you.
            Sure.

The Oscars are gay.
Going to Mom's.

He likes you.

                           What?

He's trying to be
a good wingman.

 He loves the Oscars.

               Is he homophobic?

Oh, no.
His best friend's gay.

 Sometimes I think,

the only reason
to have kids

is to feel stupid
all the time.

 You look gorgeous.

            It takes a village,
                    apparently.

           Oh, that was so nice.

I'm a nice guy.

       Yeah, I figured that out.

        I don't know what to do

 Would you like some pizza?

He took the meat lovers,

You know, I would actually
kill for pizza.

<i> Earlier this semester,</i>

<i> before my bad lip job</i>
<i> went viral,</i>

I asked you guys who do you
think is a feminist icon.

And I've been
thinking about it,

and I think that here
in Deborah's department,

     no one is.

<i> I can't be honest with</i>
<i> my students about anything,</i>

<i> not even my own fat.</i>

       So,

I have actually
resigned my position.

            What?
            Yeah.

   I know.

<i> I'm gonna write a book,</i>

which I'm really
excited about

 but I'm also really terrified.

But the biggest thing is
that I'm just really

 gonna miss all of you.

   And so I decided to make
    presents for you guys.

     I hope you like them.

   This shirt fits everybody.

It fits anybody that actually
 really cares about equality,

     regardless of gender.

  Because to me, that's what
    a feminist looks like.

      And I just really
      want to thank you

      for letting me be
        your teacher.

         I've loved it.

         ( APPLAUDING )

      Who wants a shirt?

            Yeah.
            I do.

        <i> What? Don't look at me</i>
                    <i> like that.</i>

             I'm gonna miss you
                       so much.

Oh, honey, oh, I know.
We're real friends.

I'm gonna see you

When I met Suzanne,

 I thought one thing.

I thought,
"There's a woman."

And the second thing
I thought was,

and I don't
like to use this word

but in my profession
I have to,

 "There's a fat woman."

 And when she, God help me,

 I hate to use this word too,

when she waddled
into my room and she,

 and I hate to use this word,

"sat her fatness down,"

I tried to look her
in the eye.

But all I could do
was look her in the fat

 and I thought,

"If I don't help
this woman now,

she'll be dead
within a week."
