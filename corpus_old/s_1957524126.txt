Hello.

My name is Mona Screamalot

and welcome to my family movie night.

This is my pet grandpa, Oats.

This is my puppy, Shrimp.

This is my asshole druggie brother

and the rest of my druggie family,

my poor fucking grandma.

Ew, Grandpa!

And me and my crazy family
have plenty of things

lined up for you in our
Trashy Treasure Chest.

And look, they're in
glorious HD, high defecation.

All right, one of my
favorite Christmas stories.

This little tidbit of terror

is called "Trendish".

Put it in, Grandpa.

Man, oh man, today's the day.

I've waited and it's finally here.

The new Bank Money Double C video dropped.

That hat is gonna make me

the coolest kid in high school, finally.

Mom, dad, it's the best day ever.

What, did you sprout your first pubes?

Good one.

No, not yet, but the new Big Money

Double Z video dropped.

Can't wait to see that great new hat.

That's nice.

Hey, how about if he get outta here?

We're busy, can't you see?

Okay, well I'm out of this, pop Stan.

I'm gonna go watch that video.

Buzz off, numb nuts.

Kid drives me fucking crazy, you know?

It's like, he sucks the
life out of me, you know?

Here, here, there you go.

What the fuck is with this kid?

I don't know.

I wish I understood
him, but I really don't.

These goddamn teenagers these days.

I'm so sick of all these trends.

Jesus Christ, why can't he
be more like his brother?

It's so much easier with Kyle.

He just wants what is easy and simple.

Nothing complicated about him.

Yeah, but the only problem is

that he is a serious DVD
hoarder and you know it.

I love my DVD's, my sanctuary!

My kingdom of DVD's!

I have everyone, I have
everything, all of them

but I still need more!

It's here, it's here.

The new Big Money Double Z.

I gotta see this new video

to see that great new hat.

Enter!

â™ª Hey yo, wanna look like me â™ª

â™ª Wanna look like me, wanna be like me â™ª

â™ª Wanna flow like me â™ª

â™ª What you got to do is buy my hat â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat and buy my hat â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat and buy my hat â™ª

â™ª Then you can be just as cool as me â™ª

â™ª Yo you might say what is wrong â™ª

â™ª You're not even wearing your own hat â™ª

â™ª I don't need to wear my hat â™ª

â™ª Because I'm already the
coolest mofo all around â™ª

â™ª But if you buy my hat â™ª

â™ª You'll be just as cool as me â™ª

â™ª Cool as me â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat and you'll be just like me â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat, buy my hat â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat and you'll be a cool â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat and buy my hat â™ª

â™ª Yo yo buy my hat â™ª

â™ª You better buy my hat â™ª

â™ª Buy my hat, buy my hat, son â™ª

Oh my God.

That hat is glorious.

Think I know what I want for Christmas.

Wait, not want, need.

Oh, that new hat, I've
never seen anything like it.

Mom, that hat is unbelievable.

Better than I could have ever dreamed.

I need it for Christmas.

Do you think we are made of money?

I can't get you every little
thing that your heart desires.

I'm sorry, we just can't
afford all that junk.

But you get Kyle anything
that he ever wants.

Oh, come on.

I don't wanna go on and
on about this stupid hat.

Get over it!

But I need to know that I'm
gonna get it for Christmas.

I need to know that I'm
finally gonna be cool.

Oh, a come on, stupid hat
isn't gonna make you cool.

No, you don't seem to get it.

This hat makes anyone cool.

Ask Big Money Double Z, he'll tell ya.

Get that your Double Z, number one, hat,

big money, whatever out of here.

Tell your father about it.

You just don't get it, mom.

Dad.

What the hell do you want?

I'm busy, can't you see me working?

Dad, dad, mom just told me to tell you,

I need that hat for Christmas.

She won't listen.

I think you'll get it, you'll understand.

Goddammit, can't you
see me working here?

You're always asking for
some needy, needy, needy.

"I need this, I want this."

People in hell want a cold drink?

I'm so tired of hearing about this hat.

What?

You know, you're an ass hat.

But I need the hat.

If I don't get the hat, I
don't know what I might do.

Oh, I'm shaking in my boots.

Why don't you get the fuck outta here,.

"I need this, I want this."

I'm tired of it.

Get the out fuck out.

I don't wanna hear any more
about that goddamned hat.

They just don't understand.

I need it, to be cool.

Tired of being lame.

Hey Kyle.

What do you want?

I'm trying to look at my DVDs here.

Look, Kyle, can you please just try

and convince mom and dad that I need

the new Big Money Double Z hat.

It's the only way I'm ever gonna be cool.

I'll see what I can do.

I've got really important things
to do in here with my DVDs.

Like look at my DVDs,
like categorize my DVDs,

like review my DVDs, like kiss my DVDs,

like masturbate to my DVDs.

And maybe even try and fuck my DVDs.

Too much information.

Just please do.

You have everything you
could ever dream about.

Every DVD.

And this is all I really
need for Christmas.

Just convince them somehow, anyhow.

Oh yeah, whatever, okay?

Oh, just a little lube

and I can finally lose
my virginity to a DVD.

I can't wait.

Look at that, a glue gun.

Okay, boys, it's time
to open your gifts.

Mom, dad, can I open mine first, please?

Okay, if it's okay with
Kyle, then you can go first.

Sure, it's Christmas, go ahead.

I can't wait.

Well, we know you
wanted a hat really bad.

So there you go, there's a hat.

This wasn't the hat I wanted.

This isn't it.

You made a mistake, you
must've made a mistake here.

This isn't it.

This isn't gonna make me cool.

It's a hat.

A hat is a hat.

And besides, the one you
wanted was too pricey for us.

Thanks, mom and dad, just what I wanted.

But Kyle, over there, he
gets everything he wants.

He got everything he wanted this year.

It doesn't make any sense.

Well, Kyle is a straight C student.

He deserved those DVD's.

Well, I should be just
as a part of this family.

This isn't right.

You'll be sorry.

What's with him?

What's his problem?

We got him the stupid hat.
Yeah.

And what's with that damn shirt?

He wears it every day.

Oh, Christ, it looks like
somebody threw up on it.

No, he made it...

What, did he make it in arts and craft?

He made it himself.

With that hippy dippy art teacher?

He thinks his gonna make them

and sell them on Ebay or something.

He has to ask for the extra rubber bands

from all the family
members for the fucking...

I don't want one, I hope
he doesn't make me one,

I don't need either.

Well, at least I got my DVD's.

Jerk material for me.

You know, I really thought

they were gonna come
through for me this year.

But I guess not, yet again.

Kyle gets his way and I get nothing.

They foiled me again.

This will not do, this won't do at all.

Kyle is the perfect son for them,

but somehow I just get shafted every year.

Well, they're gonna regret it this year.

I tell you what.

I'm gonna do something
unforgivable this year

for their presents

because they didn't come
through for me yet again.

You know, I really feel bad.

He really wanted that hat, honey.

We should have gotten him that hat.

Wasn't that big of a deal.

It was expensive.

We couldn't afford that hat.

On top of all those
goddamn DVD's for Kyle.

He just has to have them.

So, you know, somebody has to suffer.

So it had to be him.

And he always gets
the bad end of the deal.

Oh well, that's how it is.

This will not do, not again.

This will not do.

This will not do at all.

Every year that tubby
bastard gets everything.

Every DVD he wants.

I, everything he wants.

I don't get one thing I need.

I need this to be cool,
without it I'm lame!

And after tonight,

I'm never gonna be lame again

because what I do, it's
gonna fix them good.

Hey, mom and dad.

Your favorite son is here, you know?

The one who got exactly what he wanted

for Christmas this year.

What the hell do you want?

Jesus, I just got to sleep.

Mother and father.

You didn't get me what I
wanted for this Christmas.

So you know what your present from me is?

Death!

The sweet release of death, you die.

No!

No!

No!

Oh, no!

Where did I put that damn anal lube?

I need to try and do it with my discs.

Hello, brother.

Are you all right?

What happened?

They didn't get me what I wanted.

I just wanted to be cool.

What did you do?

They never cared about me.

They never thought anything of me.

It was always about you,

Kyle this, Kyle that,

Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

Oh my God.

What did you do to mom and dad?

Oh, you know, cut them up.

A little dicing and a little slicing.

And I'm gonna do the same to you, Kyle.

Forgive me, father for I have sinned.

Shalom.

DVD, Blu-ray Trading Stop?

Well, let's just say I
got a whole mess of DVD's

and Blu-rays to trade in for y'all today.

I'll see you later.

Oh man, with all that moolah,

I'm gonna be able to afford
every hat I've ever wanted.

I'm gonna be the coolest
guy around.

Well, I would have wanted a
barrel of acid for Christmas,

easier to dispose of your
parents' stinking corpses after.

And this blasphemous bowel
movement is "Baby Cakes."

Put it in, grandpa.

Things just really got out of control.

I mean, he's a good baby and all,

it's just the things
he's been doing lately.

They don't make sense.

What she's trying to say is

he just can't be left alone
with people he doesn't know.

That's why we brought you here.

You know, we heard a lot of good things

about you online or on television.

And you are a master
when it comes to putting

ill-mannered babies and
children in their place.

Well, listen, you know,

I'm gonna need a bigger picture.

If you could just kind of
flesh out a little bit,

the little babies behaviors

so I can get a more tactile
sense of what's happening here.

Well, I don't even know where to start.

He only seems to eat
the female babysitters

and kill the male...

Knock it off.

What she's trying to say
is he's only a bad baby

when he's left alone with
people he doesn't know.

I see, I see.

All right, here's what we'll do.

Now tell me the incident.

And I want you to describe the incident

that led you to call me
at 2:00 AM in the morning.

Well, yesterday Buddy and I went out

for a nice candle lit dinner.

So I hired the next door neighbor, Sam

to come over for a few hours.

Thanks so much, Sam for agreeing
and babysitting Baby Cakes.

Buddy and I rarely get to go out.

Now remember, Sam do not go in that room

under any circumstances if you
hear any noises whatsoever.

All right?

We have him under heavy sedation.

A big plane can crash down
this motherfucker right now.

And he won't wake up, you understand me?

Okay, but I've been your
neighbor for like two years now

and I still don't know what
little Baby Cakes looks like.

Well, let's just say

he doesn't like the outdoors that much.

And he's very malnutritioned

so we don't like taking him anywhere.

Well, the doctor's say he's special,

but anyways, we gotta go.

We're running late, we
gotta get to the restaurant.

I'm hungry as hell.

Just call us if you need us.

Right on Mr. Driscoll.

Don't worry, I'll make
sure he's safe and sound.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

Baby Cakes has been having
very bad diarrhea lately.

So if the air smells like shit,

just spray a little bit of air freshener.

When we get back, we'll change his diaper.

Bobby, Bobby, come here.

I wanna see this thing already.

Did you see the baby yet?

Did you see the baby?

Relax. Relax, relax.

Why?

Take your time.

No, no, no, no, no.

I got the camera here.

You're we gonna be rich and famous.

We're gonna be all the national news.

We'll have hookers, sluts, Jacuzzi's.

We're gonna be famous.

We have all the time
in the world for drugs.

We only have a little bit of time

until their parents come back.

Okay, let me get the camera.

Holy fuck!

The stories and rumors I
heard were true all along.

Oh my God.

Did you know this thing
ate two babysitters before?

Two females, just gobbled them right up!

Have I heard what?

Okay, let's get this thing started.

Oh God.

Get away.

So Roy, you see, that's what
we came home to last night,

which was the final straw.

And I know you can help
us with little Baby Cakes

and his anger problems
towards the babysitters.

Tell me, what did you
do with these bodies?

Well, we just stuffed
them in garbage bags

and threw them on their
family's front porch.

Okay, I think I've heard enough.

Let me see this baby of yours.

Baby.

There's my piggy.

Hi.

See what I mean?

He loves us, but he hates strangers.

Well, don't worry about it

after all that is my job,

taming these little bastards.

You little, animal!

You motherfucking piece of baby shit!

I am going to show you
who is boss around here.

Do you understand?

Do you understand?

You don't even speak English,

you silly little infant of shit.

This is gonna be a bit more
difficult that I imagined.

I'm gonna need you to leave me alone.

Finish your cookie.

No, no, thank you.

Leave.

I'm gonna work a little magic.

No, thank you.

No, thank you.

Goodbye.

Mr. Rumpeldickskin wants to play.

Do you like it when Mr.
Rumpledickskin plays with you?

Wants to play with you?

Baby, baby!

Get, get over here, you little baby!

Get, get over here now!

Screw it.

That is the worst baby
I have ever dealt with

in my entire career of baby training.

Screw it.

You're getting her all flustered.

You're not gonna leave us, are you?

Because you know, Baby Cakes
needs some training here

and you're the only professional we know.

Long before I was a
celebrity baby nanny guru,

I did some time in
Southeast Asia as a preacher

and I did some exorcisms there.

I think there are dark
forces at work here.

That thing in there is an
absolute cauldron of evil.

So I think we're gonna have
to perform an exorcism.

You don't think are baby's
possessed by demons, do you?

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

You used to be an exorcist preacher?

Why did you stop?

Well, I was fired selling
dope in a nun's outfit.

That is immaterial.

You sure this is gonna work?

No, it should.

Just remember, he who doth
tamper with the forces of nature

open the door to disaster.

What was that?

Just a little saying

we used to say at the Brotherhood
of the Foreign Exorcism.

No biggie.

Let's see.

You know what?

I may have chanted the
wrong phrase in Latin.

So I may have just invited
Satan into his vessel.

Yes, I am Satan.

Come to me, come here, come here.

Come here, come here.

Who's gonna change my diaper?

I'm covered in shit.

Come to me.

Come here.

Hey, hey, hey.

Let me the fuck in!

Who's gonna change my diaper?

I have a big old shit.

Now let me the fuck in!

Thanks Mr. Roy.

You've done everything we hoped you'd do.

All the years of practicing Satanism.

What the hell, are you talking about?

We brought you here because
of your exorcism powers.

Now me, Buddy and Satan's Baby Cakes

will take over the world

and everyone will bow down to us.

Fuck me!

All right, well "Baby Cakes" is done.

Don't you love when the Satan
worshipers win in the end?

I do, it brings a tear to my brown eye.

All right, I'll do the next one.

Oh, "Bloody Hell."

We're watching "Bloody Hell".

What's this place like, Jake?

Well, it's a
little hard to get through,

but we got a little over 200 acres.

So perfect to camp.

Are we there yet?

No, about maybe 40 more miles.

Max, get your damn dog off me.

Why don't you pay more attention
to that fleabag of yours?

You really think it was a good idea

to bring that dog along?

Of course, she's the
best oil tracker around.

I need you guys to wait right here

while I take a look around.

I just gotta make sure that
we're on the right property.

All right?

While I'm gone, can you
guys unload the stuff?

Yeah.

I won't be long.

We'll get the stuff.

We'll get the stuff, okay?

I'm back.

Yeah, we're on the right property.

I'll help you with that.

Where did Max go?

He went to take a leak.

Did he bring his dog with him?

I think.

Yeah.

It's messed up.

Okay, we'll be able to start prospecting

for some oil!

Woo!

I think that's all of it.

Okay.

Let's go.

Okay.

Yo, Max!

This should be far enough.

Emily, you dropped the shovel.

Go out there, and pitch a tent.

Thanks, see you in a bit.

We should be up there
in about two hours.

Thanks.

Great.

It looks like a good
spot to start digging, men.

Oh, my hands are freezing.

My hands are also freezing.

All right.

And if you wanna take a break you can.

Okay, Jeff, let's start.

Oh, sorry.

Did you hear something?

No, just a feeling.

Max, can you get the oil rods ready?

We're getting deep.

Yeah.

Pretty soon, the filtration will kick in.

Hurry, we've implanted the oil rod.

What about the reinforcement?

We've got to pack this in, all right?

Tomorrow, we'll try and
transplant the stuff.

The oil out of the ground, into our bags.

Hope Emily's got some nice
big supper ready for us.

Your idiot, sister.

I don't even know why
we brought her along.

Jake, Max, we had better
head back to the tent.

It's gonna be dark soon.

All right

Let's do that.

Hey, Jeff.

What?

I think I heard
something out there.

Can you check it out?

Yeah.

Jake?

Yeah?

Shine your light.

What time is it?

2:30.

Where's Emily?

Get out, run!

No, no, no!

Oh, what a happy ending.

That morbidly obese bowser
lost weight the easy way.

And this next one is "The Prom."

Starring Don and Murph.

Good find, Oats.

Mail for me!

Mail for me!

Murph, Murph, we got a letter, a letter.

Our very first letter.

No, Don, you mean our second letter?

Don't you remember the first one we got?

You know, the one from the Mormon.

Murph, I don't know
what you're talking about.

I forget things within hours.

Sometimes within minutes.

Oh Don, that's fine.

Some people remember
things better than others.

What?

Don, may I please see the letter?

What letter, Murph?

What's it say, what's it say Murph?

What's it say?

It says dear Don and Murph,

we are pleased to inform you

that you have been invited to

a special prom just for you

for an award ceremony

for all of the reviews that you've done

over the last few years,

the award ceremony will be held
at Saskatchewan university.

Wow, Murph!

What are we gonna wear to
such an auspicious occasion?

I don't know.

It should be something elegant yet snazzy,

but not too formal at the same time.

Let's just ask my parents, Murph.

Mom, dad, me and Murph got
invited to a prom just for us!

What should we wear to such
an auspicious occasion?

Oh, Don.

Auspicious, what the fuck it that?

Prom?

Who gives a shit, you fat fuck.

Why don't you go to Omar the tent maker?

See if he's got a a tent to fit your ass.

That skinny bean pole,

he can go as a goddamn pole.

I don't know, Don, don't ask me.

And don't ask me for any more money.

I just spent the last of my money

on my special shake making magic bullet.

So don't ask me for anything.

Oh, come on, come on,
we need something, please.

Well, you know, on second thought,

I think there's a tarp in the basement

that I use to cover the car over

when we went on trips.

We could maybe make that fit your fat ass.

That gives me a good idea.

Why don't you get out

our old graduation gowns and wear them?

That would be a perfect
thing to wear to the prom.

Yeah, yeah, he could wear those.

I don't know though.

I don't think there's a hell,

I don't think they're big enough.

Maybe get down to the church
and get the whole church choir.

And sow them all together, that'd work.

Don!

This is a little strange.

I think I'm gonna walk around the halls

and see if there's anyone else around.

Okay, Murph, have your fun.

But come back soon.

Oh no, I have to take a shit!

Ah, someone's in here pooping.

Well, everyone, what a showdown.

If only my prom were like that.

The only action I saw

was a bunch of baby
fetuses in the toilets.

Good times.

Onto the next one, "Caged Girl."

That's the girl of my dreams down there.

I want so bad to be with her.

But she'd never go for a guy like me.

But she will be mine.

What's happening?

Oh no, no, it's okay.

Don't be afraid.

You see, I'm your new boyfriend?

Boyfriend, I don't know who the you are.

So let me out of here
before I bite your dick off.

You're not going anyway.

You're mine now.

And I'm gonna do do
whatever I want with you.

If you don't let me out of
here my father will kill you.

He knows karate.

Karate?

I ain't afraid of that shit.

I'm going to bed, I'll see you tomorrow.

When I see you tomorrow, you
better be a better girlfriend.

Otherwise I don't even wanna say

because I'm a good Christian.

I should make the Dame some breakfast.

Yeah, and something
that'll make her smile.

Make her allegiance tinkle.

Young one, young one.

Awaken from your dream state.

I brought you something to munch on.

All that did was turn me on.

You bitch.

You stupid bitch.

Just for that, you
don't get any more food.

You don't get any bathroom,
or any shower or anything.

You're gonna piss yourself for all I care.

That bitch, that stupid bitch.

She doesn't like me.

I'm gonna make her like me.

I'm gonna make her like me.

You know what?

I'm just gonna...

All right, here's how it's gonna be.

If you want privileges,
you have to treat me right.

You have to treat me
like a real boyfriend.

That's it.

That's it, that's all you gotta do.

All you gotta do is treat
me like you really love me.

Can you do that?

Cause if not, then forget about it.

Hello.

Yeah, hey, Mr Peterson,
Patterson, I'm sorry.

It's been a busy day.

This is the office of Hanson
and Sons, the realtors.

We just wanted to make sure

everything's working
out with your new house

because we care here at Hanson and Sons.

This is what I do.

I follow up on all my
business transactions

because I look forward
to a long relationship

in the real estate realm
and continuing the business

of our relationship,

it's just absolutely tantamount.

Oh, the house is great.

But I can't overlook the fact
that my daughters missing.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm really concerned
about that, but you know

let me, let me just tell
you one father do another.

Don't worry, she'll be back.

Girls will be girls,

plus they're all little bitches

and little fucking sluts anyway.

Just probably out sucking
neighbors dog's dick.

Little whore.

Goodbye, Mr. Peterson, it
was nice talking to you.

Just remember, you can always call

the offices of Hanson and
Sons where we deeply care.

Hey there.

So, how you doing?

Oh, I'm doing fine.

How about you?

I'm fine.

So, are you ready to get physical now?

You know when I put my male
thing in your female thing?

You know?

Oh no, I smell down there, like fish.

I haven't had a shower in days
and my clothes are filthy.

Oh no, don't worry about it.

Smells like that don't bother me.

I love fish.

Oh, well it bothers me quite much.

I want our first time to be special.

Something erotic, something you see

on one of those movies
on TV, late at night.

I don't wanna smell terrible for you.

You'll always remember that.

All right, I guess that
makes sense in a way.

I really do love that smell.

So listen, I have an idea.

How about this?

You let me go upstairs
and let me take a shower.

Of course, you lock me in

and while you lock me in the shower

and I'm, you know, cleaning everything.

You go to the store and pick
me up some new accessories

for females and some new clothes.

How about it?

Huh?

That sounds fine to me.

Let's go.

There you go, that's what I got you.

So, you're all washed
up, no more fish smell.

Nice, squeaky clean, new
clothes, feminine accessories.

You're ready to get physical now?

Oh, I can't.

Why not?

I've done everything for you

and given you everything you've asked for.

What else could there be?

Well, I was thinking
about you in the shower

and I was feeling myself,
if you know what I mean?

Well, I'm not really sure, but continue.

What I'm saying is, I'm
all dried up and prunish.

All right, I'm gonna go in
my room and play with myself.

I was so ready.

I must dream tonight.

Hey, baby, you ready now?

Oh boy, I'm ready.

Oh, you're making me so horny.

Oh, you're making me so wet.

Oh baby, oh baby.

Oh, you don't know what
you're doing to me.

Over here.

Kiss me, baby, kiss me.

Gazooks, truly one of
my all time favorites.

That hottie had all the men after her.

I'm surprised you all managed
to stick around in one piece.

Well, this next one will definitely

leave a bad taste in your mouth.

It's "A Pain In The Gums."

What the hell is wrong with my mouth?

Hello, Evan!

Hello?

I said hello, dummy!

I said, hello.

Well, my name's Beth.

And I'm the bacteria inside of your mouth.

And I don't have any place to go

so I'm gonna stay here and
eat out your gum, okay?

In my mouth?

I must have accidentally
ingested some LSD or something

because this is not possible.

Well, it certainly
is not an hallucination.

Well, then what the hell is it?

Where are you?

I'm the bacteria that's living inside

your dirty water from last night.

The water from the sink?

Oh, am I so calling my landlord.

Don't be so drastic.

As long as you keep me
fed, you'll be good.

Look, look, look.

I'm gonna humor you,

even though I think I'm
really loosing it right now.

I've gotta be out of my mind.

Listen, this is gonna be a problem for me

because I've got a really
important interview

and I can't have you murmuring

inside of my head the whole time.

You're giving me a headache.

You're just gonna
have to get used of me

because I'm not going anyway baby.

That breakfast burrito was pretty good

but next time, don't use anymore chilli.

That ruins everything.

Shut up!

Jesus Christ, I'm talking to my mouth.

I'm really loosing it this time.

You're really loosing it this time.

You're fucking batshit crazy.

Gotta get it together.

Get it together, get it together.

You are not helping.

Just be quiet.

This interview is very important to me.

Jobs are for losers.

To our
next on the chopping block.

Hi.

Hey, how are you sir?

Oh, Mr. Paisley.

Oh, it seems, you've been unemployed

for the last four years.

Well, yeah, but I've been
doing a lot of volunteer work

and I babysit a lot.

Well, that makes up for
a fun-filled four years.

I've always kind of, you know,

wanted to be in broadcasting.

Shut the up fuck up!

Excuse me?

Who are you talking to?

Who was I talking to?

Oh, nobody.

I wasn't talking to anybody.

Shut the fuck up!

Did you just tell me
to shut the fuck up?

No, no, no, I didn't.

I didn't say, I didn't say anything.

No, go, go on, you were saying.

Well, my father's been
running this company

for the last 22 years.

Okay, you know what you
ungrateful piece of trash?

Get the hell out of my office.

Have a nice day!

Fuck my life!

What a fucking nut job.

I'd never hire anyone
with those work ethics.

Time to get back to business.

Step inside, you're
letting all the flies out.

Shut up!

You gotta eat.

I don't wanna eat.

You got to hell!

You can't starve me.

If I don't get rid of you now

I'm gonna starve you until you die.

I'm gonna fucking spit you
back out into the sink.

You fucking bitch!

Hurry up and feed me.

I don't wanna feed you, leave me alone.

No!

Okay fine!

That's it, I've had it!

I can still hear you!

Goddammit, that's it,
I'm gonna fuck you up!

Fuck you!

It's time to bring out the big guns.

Fine, do whatever you want.

Oh, how I love talking gum diseases.

Just last week, I had
a periodontal disease

in a Gingivitis milkshake.

I wanna watch another movie.

So sad, it's all done.

The show is all over.

We have to get going to our second job.

Let's get the fuck outta here.
