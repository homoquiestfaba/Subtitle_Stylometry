PRINCIPAL: Monroe.

Monroe!

â™ª

MO:
<i>I know this seems bad,</i>

<i>but it's not entirely my fault.</i>

â™ª

MO: <i>It's his.</i>
â€ Yo.

MO:
<i>Zeke was my sister's boyfriend.</i>

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if they called themselves that.</i>

<i>I mean, for all I know,</i>
<i>he had other girlfriends in other houses</i>

<i>who babysat their little brothers.</i>

<i>But what was I gonna do?</i>
<i>Kate was a big girl.</i>

<i>And I was not a big guy.</i>

<i>But Zeke never made me feel small.</i>

<i>You know, he didn't talk to me</i>
<i>like my parents or teachers did.</i>

<i>He took me on rollercoasters,</i>
<i>he took me to Râ€rated movies,</i>

<i>he let me taste beer.</i>

<i>He showed me a picture</i>
<i>of a naked girl on his phone.</i>

<i>Adult stuff.</i>

<i>He was the man,</i>
<i>and he made me feel like the man.</i>

[riders screaming]

ZEKE: [scoffs]
I could be an actor.

KATE:
No, you're too ugly.

ZEKE: Yeah, but like, in a hot way
like Steve Buscemi.

KATE: Oh, okay.
Like Steve Buscemi.

â€ What, you don't think
I could be an actor?

â€ No, I didn't say that.

â€ All right, fine. Try me.
Mo, tell me my dog died. Go ahead.

â€ What?
ZEKE: Tell me my dog died.

â€ Your dog died.
â€ No, like, break the news to me.

Like it's real.

â€ Zeke, I'm really sorry to tell you this.

â€ What?

â€ Your dog is dead.
â€ Stop fuckin' lyin', man!

There's no way he's dead.
Are you sure?

Are you sure?

This is insane.
I was just with him yesterday.

He looked so healthy.

God! What the fuck?!
â€ Jesus, Zeke!

â€ Eh? How about that?
â€ Do me. Do me.

â€ All right, all right, all right.
Here we go. All right.

Moâ€â€

Monroeâ€â€

Your dog was hit by a car last night.

â€ What?
ZEKE: He was killed.

â€ No. No, it'sâ€â€
â€ I was driving the car.

I was shitâ€faced.
It was against my better judgement.

KATE: All right, okay, he's 10.
He's 10, Zeke.

â€ Don't you start crying on me, bro.

Don't you start crying,
'cause then I'm gonna start crying.

â€ What the F?!

â€ Eh? That was fun!
All right, you go.

Yo. I didn't doâ€â€
I'm sorry. Iâ€â€

â€ You're sorry?
Why did you fuck her to begin with?

â€ I didn't fuck her.
â€ You did fuck her!

â€ I absolutely did not.
I just liked her photo.

â€ You're gonna fucking lie?
You're gonna cheat on me and thenâ€â€

â€ She used to be fat
and she lost a bunch of weight.

And it's summer and she looks good,

so I liked the photo
and I said, "Damn!"

â€ I justâ€â€ I can't do it anymore.

ZEKE: I'm sorry!
â€ I'm done. I can't do it anymore.

â€ I'm sorry!

Come on! Come back!

Pleaâ€â€? Ugh. Fuck.

[motorboating sigh]

MO:
Where you going?

â€ You should go back inside.

â€ Can I come with you?

â€ No, I don't think
she would like that very much.

MO: Please?

â€ She broke up with me, dude.
It's not, you know... Sorry.

â€ Does this mean
we can't be friends anymore?

â€ Don't you have friends your own age?
I mean...

â€ But you're way cooler.

â€ This is true.

All right, hop in.
We can hang for like an hour.

What are you doing?
Get in the front.

â€ Oh, I'm not allowed to sit in the front
because of the airbag.

â€ Don't be weird.

â€ Hey, Zeke!

â€ The driveâ€thru lady knows your name?

â€ Hell yeah, little homie.
â€ Sick!

[Mo grunts]

[car honking]

[continues honking]

â€ Tonight?
â€ I didn't know.

â€ Wait. What time is it?

[Mo descending stairs]

â€ Hey. I'll see you guys later.

â€ [continues honking]
â€ Where are you two going?

â€ And why does he have to honk like that?

â€ Uh, we're just gonna go get some dinner
and then watch the baseball game.

â€ Were you even gonna ask?
â€ Um, please?

â€ Why doesn't he come in to eat?

â€ Seriously, does he think
we're hard of hearing?

SHERRI:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

You know what, I already made dinner
and I don't want it to go to waste, so...

â€ [continues honking]
SHERRI: Take that. And fork.

â€ Fork. Got it.
Thanks. Love you, Mom.

â€ Hey, I thought we were gonna
watch the game together.

â€ Um, I mean, we never said that.

So, can Iâ€â€?
â€ [grunts]

â€ Okay, cool. Thanks.
Bye.

[door opens, closes]

â€ It's amazing how, you know,
you meet some kidâ€â€

some 16â€yearâ€old punkâ€â€
and you have no idea at the time

that he's gonna be parked
in front of your house every day

for the rest of your goddamn life.

â€ You gotta jerk off
before you go fuck a girl.

You know what I'm saying?
Because if you don't,

you'll come really fast
and she'll laugh at you, okay?

I jerked off before I picked you up.

Always, man.
Gotta always be prepared.

I don't know
where the fuck we're going tonight.

I made a decision.
MO: Okay.

â€ I'm gonna be a talk show host.

â€ No way! Like Jimmy Kimmel or something?
â€ Yeah.

â€ Yo, that's sick. You should do that.
â€ Yeah.

â€ You should start a podcast.
â€ Totally.

But, like, I should do that
like talk show host thing, right?

â€ Yeah, definitely.
â€ You can be, like, one of my guests.

â€ Really?
â€ Yeah.

â€ Wait, seriously?
â€ Yeah, they all have weird sidekicks.

Like Andy Richter
or like that Guillermo guy.

â€ Thanks, man.
â€ You're my Guillermo.

[indistinct bar chatter]

â€ A pyramid in Antarctica is weird.
â€ That's some shit.

â€ Explain that shit.
â€ It's from <i>Alien vs. Predator</i>, dude.

It's not real.
â€ Listen to a Joe Rogan podcast, buddy.

There's shit goin' on.

[indistinct chatter]

â€ Look at this.
â€ But I've got a tab open,

so if you guys want anotherâ€â€
â€ Hey!

Hey, I'm sorry about our friend.

Uh, we found him in a dumpster.
He's a rescue.

Sorry.
â€ [chuckles] It's okay.

Oh, don't worry, he got all of his shots
though, so, he won't bite. He's chill.

â€ What about your puppy?
â€ Who, Mo?

â€ Yeah, I mean,
he looks a little young to be in here.

â€ You look a little old to be in here.

Mo actually just got back from the army.

GIRL: Yeah?
ZEKE: Yeah, he was there for 16 years!

â€ Let's not talk about it, yeah.

ZEKE:
Anyway, he hasn't been laid in 16 years.

How crazy is that?
â€ But, hey...

...to Mo.
â€ To Mo.

â€ Welcome back, brother.
â€ Yeah, man.

â€ Hooâ€rah, right?
MO: Hooâ€rah.

â€ Hey, may we all make it to heaven
before the devil knows we're dead, baby!

ZEKE: Yeah!
MO: Cheers.

ZEKE:
Wait. What does that mean?

â€ Like, we're sinners andâ€andâ€and
bad motherfuckers and he's coming to

suck us backâ€â€ he wants us.

â€ Isn't that, like, a Buzz Frontier song?
â€ Who wants us?

What did he do?
What do we do?

â€ Satan, motherfucker, wants us.

[quarters clinking]

â€ In your fuckin' mouth.
In your fuckin' mouth!

That's a home run.
Hey, yo, Nick!

I got a home run!
Yup, I got a home run.

Fuck yeah!
â€ Okay, okay. Who's gonna drink it?

â€ Uh, this motherfucker.

â€ What? What? Whoa, whoa, wait.
Hold on, what's in that?

â€ Uh, what's in it?
Uh, whiskey,

beer, orange juice, cough syrup,

and... Xanny bar.

â€ I don't know, man.
I feel like he's gonna die

if he drinks this shit.
I'll just do it.

â€ What? No!
â€ Whoa! Hey!

â€ Fuck you! I can do it.
â€ Fuck you.

Yeah, let the kid do it.
Come on.

â€ I can at least try, bro.
â€ Yeah.

NICK: All right.
â€ I can do this probably.

â€ Oh, yo, I gotta put my song on.
Hold on.

â€ [exhales]
â€ Damn.

[<i>Word Up</i> by Cameo playing]

â€ What, are you puttin'
that thing through college, man?

Let's go. Drink up.
Fuck. Come on.

â€ Oh, damn.

Oh.
Oh, shit.

NICK: [chuckling] Jesus.
â€ My dude.

â€ How you feel?

â€ Strong.
NICK: Strong. All right.

Go ahead, strong man, hit me.

â€ Okay, yeah.
You mean for real?

â€ Yeah, hit me as hard as you can.
MO: Okay.

â€ Hey, yo, if he pukes
on any of this shit,

I'm gonna be so fucking furious,
I swear to God.

Yo, fuck!
â€ [laughing]

â€ Ha ha, pussy.


â€ Oh, hey, babe!
â€ Hi!

â€ What up there?
â€ [squeals, giggles]

What are you guys doing?
ZEKE: Oh, Mo just drank a home run.

HOLLY: What?
â€ Mmâ€hmm.

â€ Is he okay?
â€ Yeah.

â€ Yeah. I'll be fine.

Hey, Hollyâ€â€

â€ He's great.
â€ [coughing, gagging]

MO:
Ugh, fuck my life.

â€ You okay, man?
â€ Ugh. Huh?

â€ Yeah, I'm fantastic.
Who is that?

â€ It's Stacey. What up?

â€ Hey, Stacey.
I'm just like a little hungover, dude.

â€ It's Thursday.

MO: Ugh.
â€ Dope.

MO: I'm dying.
â€ [toilet flushes]

â™ª

[quiet chatter]

â€ That was fucking insane.
You're an animal.

â€ What?

â€ You literally spent
the entire first period in the bathroom

and nobody said shit.

â€ Yeah, well, if they don't notice you
when you're here,

they're not gonna notice when you're not.

â€ What?

â€ Uh, nothing.

â€ Listen, if I can get you cash,
can you get us alcohol for Paul's rager?

â€ Paul's rager?

â€ Dude, Paul Finnlin's throwing
a fucking Pimps and Hoes party

at his house on Saturday.

â€ Paul the senior?
How'd you get invited to that?

â€ Dude, they love me.
I told him I can get him alcohol.

Can you get me alcohol?
â€ No, I'm not gonna get you alcohol

so you can go drink with some seniors. No.

â€ Oh, my God.
You can come with.

Have you ever even been
to one of Paul's parties?

â€ No. Have you?
â€ No.

â€ Did they even say I could come?

â€ Don't worry.
I'm a fucking god to these people.

I can bring whoever I want.
I'll get you cash.

â€ Okay, look, I'll see what I can do,
but I don't reallyâ€â€

â€ Yes! It's so fucking on!

WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir?

Excuse me, sir.
â€ Huh? What's up?

â€ Which microwave would you recommend?

â€ Well, it depends what you use it for.
â€ It's for my grandson's dorm room.

â€ [phone vibrates]
â€ Well, who's your grandson?

Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta go.
Uh, the black one's cool.

â€ Well, what about the stainlessâ€â€
â€ [car honking]

â€ Oh, shit!
MO: Yeah! Guess who's licensed!

â€ Sick.

All right.
â€ Yeah.

â€ Jesus Christ.
It's so fuckin' hot, bro.

What's up?
â€ Not much, dude.

â€ This is tight, bro.
â€ Yeah, thank you.

It's my sister's old one.
â€ Oh, I know. I've been in here.

A couple times.
â€ It's crazy. Look.

Check it out.
Check my license out.

It's like I'm a real person now.

â€ "Monroe Leslie Harris."
â€ Yep.

â€ I didn't know they gave licenses
to people who can't reach the pedals.

I gotta say, though,
it's gonna be nice having a chauffeur.

â€ Whoa. No, no, no.

I'm not driving you around.
I'm not your chauffeur.

â€ The hell you are.
â€ No!

â€ I've been driving you around
since you were, like, nine.

You owe me, bro, and I have
an hour left for lunch. Let's fuckin' go.

â€ Fine. Fine.
Uh, play with this while I drive.

â€ He said we can keep the change?

â€ He didn't really say,
so, I mean, I guess so.

â€ All right.

You know I invented
that Pimps and Hoes party, right?

â€ You've mentioned it a few times, yeah.

â€ Well, do people talk about it?
Like that I created it?

â€ Nah, not really.
But I know.

â€ Hey, when were you gonna tell me
that your sister moved in

with her new hotâ€ass boyfriend.

â€ How'd you find out?
â€ Does it matter?

â€ I don't know, you guys broke up
so long ago, I didn't think you'd care.

â€ I don't. I don't care.
I justâ€â€ I like to be informed.

Don't you like to be informed?
It's nice to be informed.

Oh, this looks sick!
Let's get this.

â€ Yo, what are you doing?

â€ Don't worry.
We're not gonna need all of it. Relax.

PLAYER:
You suck.

â€ Okay, so my mom has
this really dope fur coat,

and I feel like it'd be a really good idea
if I wore it.

â€ Yo, are you guys talking about
Paul's Pimps and Hoes party?

â€ Huh? What?
No.

Just a senior thing.
Super lowâ€key.

â€ Yeah, I mean, Stacey invited me, so...

â€ Whoâ€â€ who's Stacey?

â€ You know, he's got big chapped lips,

kinda looks like
he's confused all the time,

wears really douchey clothes.

â€ Fire crotch.

â€ Yeah, he said if brought alcohol,
I could come.

So, I'll see you guys there?

â€ Stacey's going rogue.

â€ Ahh!
â€ [chuckling]

â€ Why do you wanna quit the baseball team?
You're so good!

â€ I used to be so good
when I was 11 and you were the pitcher.

But this is high school varsity,
and these kids are massive.

â€ Did you even ask
if it's all right to stop playing?

It's not too late in the year?
â€ No. We're not having this discussion.

No. You are not a quitter.

And what are you gonna do after school?

You know, just sit around at Zeke's
doing God knows what? No.

And you're not too small.
I mean, look at Jose Altuve, you know?

You just need to practice more.

Hey, hey, do you wanna
go work on your swing?

We canâ€â€ we can do it right now.
We can do it right now.

â€ That is such a great idea!
â€ Yeah, I mean...

Well, I was, uhâ€â€ I was supposed
to go to Zeke's tonight, so...

But he's, he's gonna be
helping me with my homework.

[both scoffing, chuckling]

MO:
What? Why are you laughing?

â€ You don't actually think
we believe that, do you, Mo?

â€ Yeah, I mean, I can help you
with your homework.

I do have two degrees,
which is two more than Zeke.

â€ Yeah, but Zeke's had
most of these classes before, so...

â€ All right, be back by 10:00.
â€ Thank you.

REUBEN: And be careful in that car.
â€ I will.

â€ All it takes is 10 seconds of stupid
to ruin your whole life.

â€ What are you talking about, bro?
Your parents love me!

â€ No, you know how my dad gets.
He just freaks out about stuff.

Oh, hey, don't put
too much water in that.

They're gonna notice if they're,
like, drinking straight Evian.

â€ Yeah, but it don't matter.
Nobody's gonna say anything.

Nobody wants to be the dude
who don't feel it.

â€ So, you've never seen this game before?
NICK: This is awful taxiing.

JORDAN: Come on!
Come on, time's about to run out!

â€ I'm trying!

â€ I'm gonna get us to Pizza Hut.
Move.

â€ Yo, let her learn!

ZEKE:
Holly, do you believe this shit?

NICK: Watch me work.
JORDAN: Come on, come on, come on.

â€ He says his parents don't like me.

â€ That's absolutely ridiculous.
â€ Mmm, 'scuse me.

â€ What parents wouldn't want
their teenage son hangin' out here?

â€ What? I don't ask him to hang out.
He just comes over.

HOLLY: Uhâ€huh.
â€ Fuck you. I'll leave right now.

â€ Don't. Please.

Dude.

â€ What?
â€ Stop being creepy. You're staring.

â€ I wasn't staring, dude.
What are you talking about?

â€ She's not a piece of meat.

â€ My gosh, will you leave him alone?

Here.
â€ I'm good.

â€ Oh, he don't smoke.

â€ What? Why?

Well, do your friends smoke?

â€ Hello!
â€ No, your high school friends.

â€ Iâ€â€ I don't really have any.

I mean, I like hanging out
with these guys more.

â€ No, it was actually a good gig, bro.

'Cause you didn't actually
work for the zoo.

We worked for, like, an independent thing.

So, it was like I was actually
a professional photographer.

â€ You're missing out on some
of the best memories you'll ever have.

â€ No, you're not.
â€ Yes, he is.

Zeke still wishes
he was back in high school.

â€ That's not true at all.

â€ It's okay, I do too.
I'll admit it.

â€ Well, that's 'cause
you guys were, like, legends.

â€ That's true.
â€ We were.

â€ Yo, I got an idea.
You know what you should do?

You should sell my pot at your party.
We'll make mad money.

â€ What? No.
I don'tâ€â€ no.

â€ Why not?
You just show up with a bunch of drugs.

You'll be the drug guy at the party.

â€ No, no, no, I'm good.
No, thank you.

â€ Back me up.
â€ I'm not touching this.

â€ Hold on.
MO: No, dude, I just...

I seriously hate him sometimes.

â€ No, you don't.
You love him.

You guys are like an old married couple.
It's cute.

â€ Yeah, well, he only treats me like this
to impress you.

ZEKE: Alrighty then.

So, I got these for, like, 30 a pop.

So, I say you sell them
for, like, a hundred.

And then we'll split it down the middle.

â€ What, you think
I'm just gonna walk into a party,

and everyone's gonna
wanna buy pot from me?

â€ Call me crazy.

[bass thumping in house]

â€ Am Iâ€â€?
â€ Downstairs.

â€ Okay.

â™ª hipâ€hop music plays â™ª

â€ Yo, dude, where the fuck you been?

â€ I got lost, I don't know.

â€ Who's ready to party?!

[indistinct party chatter]

Isn't this the best?

â€ Yeah, mmâ€hmm. Yeah, this is cool.

â€ Bro...

â€ Yeah. Okay.
â€ See that girl over there?

She's so fuckin' hot!

â€ Uh, you mean your sister?

â€ Oh. Fuck.

â€ What the fuck are you doing here?
â€ Hey, Lisa.

Well, Josh said if I bring alcohol,
I could come.

â€ Where did you getâ€â€?

Do Mom and Dad know you're here?

â€ Please don't be a bitch.
â€ Is that my hat?

â€ Look, you never wear this.

This has been in your closet forâ€â€
â€ I'm texting Mom.

â€ Sheâ€â€ she's bluffing.
We good. We good.

[chuckles nervously]

â€ Hey, look, so Staceâ€â€
I, um...

I brought some weed.
â€ What?

â€ I mean, if you're not interestedâ€â€
â€ What? I can't hear you.

â€ I brought marijuana.

â€ Bro, you're my goddamn hero,
do you understand?

â€ How much you want
for all of these?

â€ Um, I don't know, maybe like 200?

Does that sound likeâ€â€?
â€ You are the fucking man!

â€ Yeah?
â€ Do you take Venmo?

â€ Sure. Okay.
STACEY: See? What did I tell you?

He's one of us!
He's a 10!

PARTYâ€GOER:
I gotta text Danny to get in here.

â€ Yeah, sweet.
So, if you Venmo me, that's perfect.

â€ You're not gonna hang and smoke with us?

â€ What? No, I'm blazed, bro.

I smoked before, so...
â€ He's a legend. Holy shit.

PARTYâ€GOER: True dat.
STACEY: That's my fucking boy, friend.

â€ Yo. Next one.

[indistinct chatting]

â€ Hey, sorry about him.

â€ What?
â€ Excuse me?

â€ Yeah, I just found him out back
in the dumpster. He's a rescue.

â€ Bro, are you fuckin' serious?

â€ You should rub his belly.
He likes that.

Just 'cause, like, you're a dog,
so I was makingâ€â€

â€ You little piece of shit!

PARTYâ€GOER: Chad, Chad.
â€ What the fuck, man?!

â€ Don't fuck with Mo.
Mo is crucial.

You need a smoke?
Come on, let's smoke.

CHAD:
But he called me aâ€â€

JOSH:
Let's smoke.

â€ I don't think he got your joke.

â€ Yeah, no, I thinkâ€â€
I think I fucked up the punchline.

â€ I didn't know you were friends
with any of these people.

â€ Well, I'm not really.
â€ Oh.

â€ Yeah, but, I mean,
most of my friends are just older.

â€ Like your parents?
â€ [chuckles] Funny. No, um...

Well, my best friend is Zeke Presanti.
Do you know him?

He used to go to our school.
He was a big deal back in the day.

But, yeah, he sort of, like,
invented these parties.

â€ He invented hanging out in basements?

â€ Yeah, well, I think so.
â€ [chuckles]

â€ So, how'd you get invited?
I mean, you're not a senior.

â€ Oh, I don't think those rules
apply to girls.

â€ Oh, gotcha.

â€ Who's Reuben?
â€ Oh, Reuben? He's just, um...

Just a pimp that I know.
Let me borrow his robe.

â€ Reuben is your dad.
â€ Reuben is my dad, you're right.


â€ I think they honestly
just got bored of drinking

in the same shitty basement
every weekend,

so they gave each party a theme.

I mean, they're not always pimps,
but the girls are always hoes.

â€ So, what kind of hoe
are you supposed to be?

â€ What did you just fucking call me?

â€ Wait. No, no.
I didn't mean it like that.

I just meant because, you know...
â€ I'm kidding.

I mean, this is the only costume I had,
and Hermione was the ultimate pimp.


â€ Whew. Uh.
â€ What is that shark?

â€ Oh, I just saw <i>Jaws</i>.
â€ You just saw it?

â€ Yeah, it's great!
Have you seen it?

â€ [chuckling] Yes.
â€ It's so good.

â€ You're so ridiculous.

â€ Look, I know you're all
into your new hot boyfriend,

but do you have to shove him in my face
and, like, the whole internet's face?

Like, we get it.
â€ I'm not shoving him down your face.

I'm living my life.
Also, by the way, you should try it.

â€ [scoffs]
What do you think I'm doing?

â€ You're just getting tattoos.
I don't know.

â€ Is this your belt?
â€ No, that's not my belt.

Fuck, this was a mistake.

â€ What's wrong? What?

â€ Because I'm 23,
I'm taking the LSAT in less than a month,

and I'm fucking my childhood boyfriend...
â€ Childhood?

â€ ...in the parking lot
of a Raymour & Flanigan.

â€ Childhood? We are children.
What are you talking about?

â€ I'm not, actually.
I'm dating an adult man.

â€ Oh, excuse me.
"I'm dating an adult man."

Well, you wanted to do this.

â€ I know I wanted to do this.
That's not the point.

It's different this time.
I don't think we should do it again.

â€ All right. Sure.

â€ Okay.
â€ Well, whatever you want.

â€ I'm gonna go.
â€ Okay. All right.

[car door opens]

â€ I need you to walk me to my car.
It's really dark and sketchy out there.

â€ Sure.

Pea shoots? What the fuck are pea shoots?
â€ I don't know.

Dude, selling to those kids was
so much easier than I thought.

Like, they just ate it up.

â€ Wow, are you telling me
that 17â€yearâ€olds wanted drugs?

Hey, sir, do you know
where the pea shoots are?

Fuckin' Holly.

â€ No, it was just crazy 'cause like
I didn't think they'd wanna pay that much.

â€ Dude, kids your age don't know
how much drugs cost.

It's hilarious, you know?

And the rich ones don't care.
They just want to get high.

Dude, where the fuck are the pea shoots?
â€ Dude, just ask someone.

â€ I just did.
â€ I know, but ask someone that works here.

â€ Yo, bro, do you have pea shoots?

â€ Pea shoots?

Is that like a vegetable?

â€ I don't know, man. My girlfriend just
gave me this whole list of shit to get.

â€ Do you know where the pea shoots is at?

â€ Nah, man.
â€ Go fucking look for 'em, man.

â€ Yo, did you just
call her your girlfriend?

â€ I did.
â€ No way!

â€ Yeah.
â€ That was fast.

â€ No, it's time for, like,
an adult relationship, you know?

Like, childhood's been over.
You know what I'm saying?

â€ Who's your girlfriend?
Is she bad?

CLERK:
I don't think we got any pea shoots, boss.

â€ Sophie was at the party, too.

â€ Dude, one thing at a time, all right?

â€ She looked hot.
â€ Huh? Who?

â€ I told you about Sophie.
â€ Yeah.

â€ She's hot.
â€ Yeah.

â€ She was at the party.
â€ Sick.

â€ I don't think we got
any pea shoots, boss.

â€ All right, well, do you have,
like, an equivalent?

Or should I just get regular peas?

â€ Don't ask me.
Just get the next thing on the list.

â€ Fish sauce?
SUPERVISOR: Fish sauce?

What, you mean, like, cocktail sauce?
Like, fuckin' shrimp dip?

â€ Yo, what the fuck is she cooking?

â™ª

[Holly laughing]

â€ This was great, Holly.
â€ Thanks.

â€ Yeah, she's like
the best cook in the world.

â€ Yeah, even though you didn't get me
anything I asked for.

â€ 'Cause everything you asked for
was fuckin' stupid.

â€ [chuckles]
â€ He's only saying that to impress you.

â€ It's working.
â€ Yo, Mo likes a girl.

â€ Who?
â€ Uh, her name's Sophie.

She goes to my school.
You might know her, actually.

She was a freshman
when you were a senior.

â€ Sophie Miller? Sophie Pierre?
Sophie Huebscher?

â€ No. Sophie Willits.

â€ Sam Willits' little sister?
ZEKE: What the fuck?

How do you know everyone in the yearbook?

â€ Does she like you back?
â€ Honestly? No clue.

I mean, she's got this superâ€sarcastic
sense of humor,

which makes it really hard to tell
when she's being serious,

but, I don't know, I kinda like it.

â€ Ah, dude, she likes you.
What's not to like?

â€ You think so?
â€ Look, this is how you get her. Ready?

â€ Please.

â€ All you have to do
is give her tons of attention.

Call her a lot, you know?

Be like, "Hey, what's up? It's Mo."
You know, "How are you?"

And she'll be like, "Oh, hi."

â€ Call her, not text her?
â€ Mmâ€hmm. Pay attention to what she likes.

Like what drinks she likes at Starbucks.

That's really cut if you, like,
get herâ€â€ walk her to school

and be like, "I got you a Frappe."
You know?

And then just as you start getting close,

that's when you slowly start to back away
and you go fuckin' ghost.

â€ Very cool.
â€ Yeah, and then she'll go nuts.

She'll be like, "What the fuck?!
I thought Mo liked me!

Why isn't he liking my photos?
Am I ugly? Did I do something wrong?"

And that's when you got her.
That's when you swoop in like a hawk.

â€ Sex?
â€ Yes.

â€ Oh, my God.
You guys are gross.

â€ What? Am I wrong?

â€ No, you're right.
And your advice will definitely work.

But you just use these tricks
because you're a dick.

Maybe Mo can just be himself,

and girls will like him
because he's such a great guy.

â€ Yeah, you're right.

â€ You know,
Mo is way better looking than you.

Hot guys don't need to play
those kind of games.

â€ Wow. In my own house.

â€ What do you mean you already ate?

â€ Well, Zeke's girlfriend
actually made me dinner.

It was pretty good.

â€ Oh, perfect! Maybe Zeke's girlfriend
can do your laundry

and pay for your school
and driâ€â€

[phone ringing]

â€ Hello?

<i>Hello?</i>

â€ Hey. Sophie?

Uh, hey. It's uhâ€â€
It's Mo.

Monroe. Harris.

â€ Yeah. What's up?

â€ Nothing much. Uh, you?

â€ Did you just call me to say hi?

â€ Yeah, is thatâ€â€?
That's weird, isn't it?

â€ Yeah.

â€ Well, uh, what areâ€â€
what are you doin'?

â€ <i>Just watching</i> The Wire.

â€ Nice.
â€ Yep.

You know, you're, like,
the first person since eighth grade

to call just to say hi.

â€ Oh, yeah?

Well, who's the one with no friends now?

â€ I have friends.
They just text me like normal people.

â€ Yeah, that makes way more sense.

â€ There are fewer awkward silences.

[Mo chuckles]

â€ So, what are you doin'?
â€ You already asked me that.

â€ Right, um...
You know, can, um, can I call you later?

â€ Maybe you canâ€â€
â€ Or text. Or I'll text you.

â€ I'm messing with you.
You can call me.

MO:
<i>Right, no, yeah, no.</i>

â™ª

[student chatter]

â€ Hey, Soâ€â€
â€ Mo, my man!

â€ Hey, Stacey, what's up?

â€ How'd you like
that party the other night?

â€ It was fun.
â€ Yeah, it was fucking dope, dude.

It was, like, a 10.
â€ Yeah. Okay.

â€ Yeah, we're doin' it again.

This weekend. Paul's house.
Bring the party supplies.

â€ Wait. Paul's parents
are letting him do that again?

â€ Paul's parents
don't give a fuck about anything.

It's very dark.

Just bring that sweet, sweet drink
and that loudâ€ass dank.

You know what I'm saying?
â€ [chuckles]

Dude, that was sort of, like,
a oneâ€time thing. I'm not like aâ€â€

â€ Listen, man.
I need this, all right?

If I don't get my penis touched
once in my life, I'll kill myself.

â€ I thought you said
Lauren touched your penis that one time.

â€ That was a lie.

â€ Okay, yeah.
I'll talk to my guy, all right?

Hey, Sophie! Sophie!

Uh, you like coffee?

â€ Yeah, bro, I can only get, like,
two ounces with my medical card.

Nick, you got a card?
â€ Yo, man, can I swing?

â€ Hey, honest opinionâ€â€

The kid's gonna ripped off.
You should go with him to the party.

â€ I ain't goin' to the party.
â€ Why not?

â€ Seriously, man, can I bat?

â€ I can't go to the party,
because Mo's a minor.

So, if Mo gets in trouble,

he'll just get in trouble
like those kids get in trouble.

You know, he'll have to,
like, erase a blackboard

or go to detention.
Me? I'll do hard time!

I'm not ready for that.
I can't be the face of this operation.

â€ Well, I don't wanna be
the face of this operation, either.

â€ Yo, hit.
â€ Oh, come on!

â€ Step up, kid.

ZEKE:
What the fuck was that?

MO: That one didn't feel good.
â€ Do you listen?

Remember what I told you?
â€ No.

â€ You gotta use your height
to your advantage.

You gotta get low,
so there's no strike zone.

You'll walk every time.

TONY: He's in a fucking cage, man.
He can't strike out.

â€ This feels weird.
I never saw you do this.

â€ 'Cause I was good.

â€ Okay, if you're so good,
why'd you leave the team?

â€ 'Cause itâ€â€ it was very political.

MO: Oh, hey, can you take the next right?
Take a right up there.

ZEKE: Why? All right, all right.
Where are we going?

â€ Uh, I just have to stop by
my sister's new place

and pick up a box
that she wants me to store for her.

â€ Huh? Fuck no! What?

â€ What? Are youâ€â€?
Why are you freaking out?

â€ I can't just show up
to your sister's house unannounced.

I'd look insane.

â€ You're not showing up unannounced.
You're with me.

â€ It's fucking weird, dude.
Does she know I'm coming?

â€ No, but I didn't talk to her, okay?
My mom did.

â€ This sucks, bro.
You suck.

Dude, is her stupidâ€ass boyfriend
gonna be there?


What are you laughing at.
â€ I don't know.

It justâ€â€ it brings me a lot of joy
to see you this flustered.

Never seen you like this.

â€ You're mean.

All right, I'm gonna wait in the car.

MO: [scoffs]
Fine.

â€ I'm not gonna wait in the car
like an asshole.

Wait up.

â€ Monroe, my man!
â€ What's up, Doug? How you doin'?

â€ What's up, buddy?

Zeke! How's it goin', buddy? Hey!

Hey, sorry about the boxes.
We're still moving in.

You guys were at the batting cages?

ZEKE: Uhâ€huh.
MO: Yeah.

â€ Man, you should've told me.
I used to love that spot as a kid.

â€ [chuckles]
We're the same age.

â€ Momo, thank you!

You didn't say
you were bringing your babysitter.

â€ Yeah, well, it is a fullâ€time job, soâ€â€

â€ You guys want something to drink?
â€ No.

â€ Sure. Yeah.
â€ Okay.

Don't you have homework or something?
â€ Yeah, don't you?

'Cause then Mom and Dad
are gonna be mad at me,

and I don't want them to do that.
â€ Come on, stick around for one.

Beer for the big guy,
Coke for the little guy.

â€ Oh, for sure.
â€ Cheers, guys.

â€ Enjoy your Coke.
Really nice place, guys.

Fuck.

DOUG: You like it?
â€ Hmm?

â€ It's actually one of
my favorite artists working right now.

â€ Oh, that.
The painting. Yes.

DOUG: Yeah, all of his stuff
sort of makes fun of

the overâ€commercialization
of the art market.

It's fascinating stuff.

â€ Yeah, bro, it'sâ€â€
It's mad orange.

â€ [chuckles] Yeah.
â€ Yeah.

We've actually gotten
super into collecting recently.

â€ Oh, have you?
Oh, that's nice.

â€ And a guy at my firm said
it'd be a really good investment, so...

Kinda just been diving in headâ€first.

Oh, let me show you
this other thing I bought.

â€ Ah, that's all right, man.

DOUG: No, come on. You're gonna love it.
â€ Nah, I'm all right.

DOUG: Come on, it's so good.
â€ All right, fuck it.

DOUG: We'll be a couple minutes.
â€ Okay.

Why did you bring him?

â€ [chuckles]
What?

â€ You should, like,
be making friends your own age.

â€ You sound just like Dad.

â€ No, I'm being serious.

â€ I went to a house party last week.
â€ That's amazing!

See, that's what you should be doing.

Not, like, driving around
with Zeke all day.

â€ I like hanging out with Zeke.

â€ I'm sure you do.
I liked hanging out with Zeke, too,

but it stops being fun really fast.
Trust me.

ZEKE:
<i>Yo, that dude's a fucking tool.</i>

MO:
I kinda like him.

So, I've been thinking about
this whole drug thing.

â€ Yeah?
â€ And it was fun to do it that one time,

but I don't want to be
the party supplier guy.

You know what I mean?
It just kinda like feels sketchy.

â€ No, no, you're trippin'.
It's not the same thing.

You're not a drug dealer.
â€ But I mean, likeâ€â€

â€ You're not! You're just a guy
that sells weed and booze to his friends.

They'd find it anyway.

â€ Yeah, but I feel like it's gonna
become this whole thing.

â€ It won't.

â™ª

MO:
See you, buddy.

â€ Hey, guys.
How was your night?

â€ Hey, uh, it was good.
What, uh, what are you doing?

â€ Mom said you went to the batting cages.
I would've driven you.

â€ Yeah, no, sorry.
We were just, uh, by.

It wasn't, like, a thing.

â€ Go get ready for bed.

Hey, Zeke, can you hang on a second?
â€ Okay.

What's up?

â€ Hey! How's it goin', bud?

â€ Uh, good, good.
But I should get going, so...

â€ Oh, no, no, no.
No, no.

Look, Zeke, I actually like you.
â€ Okay.

â€ And I know that Eddie Haskell shit
works wonders for Sherri.

â€ I don't know who that is.

â€ But not me.

I work in advertising, so...

Mo looks up to you.

You know, he's never had an older brother,
and he's always seen you that way.

â€ Yeah, yeah. I totally get it.
I totally get it.

Well, I should be going, so...

[starts engine]

â€ Okay, look, Zeke,
I'm not your dad, you know,

but, just, just, you know,
you and your friends,

forget that he is 16.

â€ What's this?
â€ That's for taking care of Mo.

â€ Oh, no, I like hanging out with Mo, man.

It's not a job.
You don't gotta pay me.

â€ That's why I'm giving you this.

Because it is a job.

You know, if he starts
smoking dope or drinking then...

you're not doing your job.

â€ Well, I think Mo's a really great kid.

â€ I do too.

â€ So, can I have a raise?

Mr.â€â€ Mr. Harris?
Can Iâ€â€ can I have a raise?

Mr. Harris?

â™ª <i>16 yearâ€old</i>
<i>Bitch</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Daytrip took it to ten</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I got hoes calling</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>A young nigga phone</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Where's Ali</i>
<i>with the motherfucking dope?</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I be ballin' like a mo'fuckin' pro</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I be ballin' like my nigga Mo</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Sheck Wes, I ain't a mo'fuckin' joke</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Steph Wes stay with the fuckin' pole</i> â™ª

â€ Mo! There you are!
â€ You know my name?

â€ Question.
â€ What's up?

â€ Is there any way
you could score me some molly?

You obviously have some insane hookâ€up.

â€ Um, I mean, I couldâ€â€
â€ No, no, no. Trust me.

Have you ever had sex on molly?

â€ [stammering] Well,
um, yeah, I mean, all the time, yeah.

â€ It would be very fucking cool of you.

â€ That's Tylenol,
and let's see what we got here.

Oh, these are Xannies.
These'll work.

I don't know what the fuck that is.

Uh, this is Propecia.
You'll find out what that is soon enough.

Uh...

Mmâ€hmm.

Sick. Molly.
All right, cool.

You can't get anything less thanâ€â€

â€ Thirty for your molly.
â€ Fuck, yeah.

â€ That cures your ache,
cures your ache.

â€ So, like, what is your, like, best weed?

â€ "My best weed?" What?
Who invited this guy?

[all laughing]

No, I'm kidding.
I love you, sweetheart.

â€ Is this gonna get me fucked up?

â€ [chuckles]
What the fuck do you think?

[all laughing]

Yo, what do you think about this jacket
for my date with Sophie? You like it?

â€ Yeah, man, I mean, we got money now.
Go for it.

â€ Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
Yeah. I like it.

I think it sort of
looks like a ninja coat, you know?

â€ Hey. Hey! Excuse me?

Do you have a ninja coat in,
like, a child's size?

Dude, you should bring her over tonight
to the crib, you know?

See her with your boys,
you in your element.

â€ I'll make you look really good.
â€ You think?

â€ Fuck yeah.
You know that.

â€ Yeah, maybe I will.
That sounds like a good idea.

ZEKE: Cool.

â€ As long as it doesn't
turn into the Zeke Show.

â€ Zeke Show?
â€ Yeah, Zeke Show.

â€ What do you mean Zeke Show?
What's a Zeke Show?

â€ Do the thing you do were you're like,
"Ah, look at me!"

â€ Bro, you wouldn't even be
with this chick if it wasn't for me.

Relax.

â€ Dude, do you think I should
do something different with my hair?

â€ Guess what I did the other day!
â€ What?

â€ I quit my job!

â€ You quit?
ZEKE: Yeah! Isn't that awesome?

â€ Uh, okay. Yeah, why?

â€ I don't know, I figured things are going
so well with, you know, me and you.

I figured, why...

Why work?

â€ Sure. I guess.

â€ Plus, your dad even gave me,
like, 50 bucks.

â€ Why? Wait, really?
â€ Yeah.

What, do you think
I like hanging out with you?

This is a job, okay?

And if you're out
smoking dope and drinking,

then I'm not doing my job.

â€ [chuckles]
So is this, like, your move with girls?

â€ My move with girls? What?
I don'tâ€â€ I don't haveâ€â€

â€ Yeah. Take them to sushi?

â€ No, this is, this is
my very first time doing this.

â€ You've never been on a date?
â€ No, I just...

Like, I mean, this is the first time
I've brought a girl here.

â€ Have you been on a date, though?

â€ [chuckles]
No.

Have you?

â€ No.
I mean, not really.

Not, like, an adult date like this.

â€ So, um, you doing anything after this?

â€ I mean, you asked me out on this date.
I mean...

â€ I was just thinking, you know, maybe
we could go over to my friend's house.

â€ What do you do at your friend's house?

â€ Um, anything really.

It's like the chillest place
on Earth you can go.

And, like, there's just
all these older dudes,

like, smoking weed and drinking and stuff,
playing video games.

It's sick.

â€ Doesn't sound sick.

â€ Bro, I swear, every time we order this,
it's, like, a different meat.

â€ Everything's gross, man.
We live here.

â€ I think this is cat.
â€ I believe that.

â€ Jesus, dude, you gotta
fix the fucking AC, man.

â€ Why don't you
take your fucking sweater off?

â€ No, it's dope.

â€ Hey, guys.
We interrupting something?

â€ Hey!
â€ Ah, new friend. Hi.

â€ Hey, be nice.
â€ So, this is your secret clubhouse.

â€ Yeah, I hope he blindfolded you
before he came here,

'cause we can't let this location out.

â€ That's fuckin' creepy.

â€ I was kidding.

â€ Hey, Momo, come here, doggy.
â€ Yo, what's up?

â€ Let me talk to you, man.
â€ Thank you.

â€ You know I'm the last one
to judge you, right?

â€ Yeah, of course.

â€ Okay, well, as your boy,
I gotta tell you,

you're acting real silly right now,
all right?

That chick is, like, 16 years old.

Shame on you.

â€ Nick, I'm 16.
â€ Exactly... What?

â€ Why are we doin' this, man?
â€ Come on, man! It's for Mo!

â€ Here, for maximum grip,
get that thumb.

â€ [chuckling] Okay.
â€ All right, you're set. Cheers.

â€ Dope, dude, thank you.

â€ Do me.
â€ [sighs]

â™ª rap music playing â™ª

â€ Here you go.
â€ Really?

â€ Drink responsibly, okay?

â€ If I can just get it over
the fucking brim, then...

Shit.

â€ So, Mr. Rispoli gave us
a pop quiz out of nowhere,

and I was like, "What the fuck?"

So, Tiffany, my friendâ€â€
she's kind of a whoreâ€â€

she gave me, like, three Adderall
and I was...

â€ Sophie's cute.
â€ Right?

â€ Yeah.
â€ Well, thank you.

â€ And I still got an 89, so, yeah.

Wait, are you the DJ?
Play Meghan Trainor!


â€ Mo, come on, let's dance.
â€ Okay, yeah, let's dance.

â€ [phone vibrating]
â€ Wait, Mo. Your phone.

â€ What? No, that's not mine.
That's Zeke's.

[indistinct chatter]

â™ª

â€ Hey, Holls, tonight's been
real eyeâ€opening for me.

You know what I'm sayin'?

This motherfucker's 16 years old.
Been kickin' it with this dude for a year.

Fuck, man, I'm pushing 30.
I don't even have a car.

[bottles clanging]

â€ Yo, you pissed yourself!
â€ Nah, it's beer, B, it's beer!

â€ Nah, it's cool, bro.
Me too.

[both laughing]

â€ Finish! Finish!

ZEKE:
Oh, shit! She's done!

[all cheering]

ALL: Yeah!

SOPHIE:
I mean, you don't have to wait for me.

I mean, it's two minutes away.

MO: Nah, it's cool. Don't worry about it.
â€ Okay. [chuckles]

It's cute the way that you look at them.

â€ Cute? Wait, who? Them?
â€ Yeah, you love them!

â€ I don't love them.
Zeke's like he's my older brother, okay?

â€ You guys are like Batman and Robin.
â€ Well, sort of.

It's more like Batman
and Batman's fuckedâ€up older friend.

[both laughing]

â™ª

[phone vibrating]

â€ Well... that was weird but fun.
â€ Yeah.

â€ Uh, I guess I'll see you at school?

â€ Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you at school.

â€ Okay. Bye.
â€ See ya.

â€ Hey, how you spell Zeke again?
â€ Oh, it don't matter, man.

â€ Oh, my God, guys!
That was amazing!

â€ You just fucked that girl?

â€ What? No!
I was out there for, like, three minutes.

No, but, like, we kissed and stuff.

NICK: Oh, thank God.

â€ What? Guys, it was sick!
There was lots of tongue and everything!

She brushed up against my penis!
It was like...

â€ [Nick laughing]
â€ Tongue Daddy.

â€ Tongue Daddy!
â€ Aaaaaahhhhh!

This is dope.

â€ This one?
â€ Yeah.

â€ Yeah, um...

Yeah, it sort of just looks like a bunch
of scribbles and dicks on a blank canvas.

â€ Yeah.

When you get older,
you realize that's kinda all life is.

It's just a bunch of scribbles and dicks

â€ [chuckling] There's more to life

â€ No, there isn't.

Hey! Do you work here?

â€ Yes.
MO: What are you doing?

â€ Trying to prove to your sister
that I'm not a loser.

How much for that?
â€ Excuse me?

â€ I wouldâ€â€ I would like

â€ Yeah, how does this work?

â€ There are poster prints

â€ What, is she mad 'cause of all theâ€â€?
â€ No, she's not mad at that.

No, she's just...

Girls are fucking weird, bro.

Like, they get mad at you for shit

They're like, "I'm mad at you."

And you're like,
"Well, why? Everything's great!"

â€ What did you do
that you didn't know you were doing

that got her all mad?

â€ Don't worry about it.

â€ All right.
â€ How's your girl?

â€ I mean, good, I think.
You know?

I don't know if I can call her

â€ Yeah, you should probably

I think it's time.

â€ Yeah, but we kissed.
â€ 'Cause of me. You kissed 'cause of me.

â€ Just go take a shower.

â€ We can't tell them

â€ Everything. All of it.

â€ This is exactly

â€ Sweetheart, justâ€â€ just stop talking.

â€ Come downstairs,

â€ No, no, you just got out of the shower.
No, put your hand down.

Put it down. Put it down. Put down.
Now! Put it...

â€ Oh, please don't.

â€ You permanently inked "Tongue Daddy"

â€ Oh, my God.

â€ It's fine!
It's an inside joke!

â€ So, why did you put it

â€ 'Cause I'm an idiot!
â€ Oh, you are really on a roll tonight!

We could hear you downstairs.

â€ Go head, go ahead.

I got it at the mall.

â€ <i>It was used, but it's cool.</i>
â€ Dude, I'm in a lot of trouble.

Can we focus, please?
â€ Well, are you allowed to go to school?

â€ My parents aren't grounding me

â€ Well, that's good, I guess.
You're still going to the party, right?

â€ Are you listening
to anything I'm saying, like, at all?

â€ You have to go to the party, dude!
Nick already got all those drugs!

â€ No, I can't!

â€ Sneak out the fucking window, dude!
You're a foot tall!

Use the doggy door.
â€ No. Iâ€I can't.

â€ [sighs] Dude.

I quit my fucking job for you.
â€ I didn't tell you to do that.

[bedroom door opening]

â€ I need to talk to you.

â€ Sure. Yeah, okay.

â€ Who's that?

â€ Zeke.

â€ Hang up.

â€ Did you hear that?

â€ Yeah, is that Reuben?

â€ Yeah.
â€ <i>You'll be all right, man.</i>

Kids are supposed to make mistakes.

That's what the whole point

It's the best.
You get to fuck up, you know?

I used to fuck up all the time.
â€ Okay.

REUBEN:

'Cause there is
nothing you can possibly do

that I won't find out about.
â€ I know. I'm sorry.

â€ You're not allowed to see him anymore.
â€ Who?

No, Dad. Don't blame Zeke.
This isn't his fault.

â€ Of course it is.

â€ No, youâ€you can't do this.
He's my best friend!

â€ He's 23 years old,
he smokes pot all day, doesn't have a job.

â€ He's starting a podcast.
â€ [laughing] No.

â€ What?
â€ No, he's not.

And you know how I know that?
Because he didn't.

The world doesn't care about
what you <i>might</i> do

if you really put your mind to it.

The world cares about
what you actually <i>did</i>.

â€ I'm not gonna stop seeing him.

â€ Fine, Mo.
Do whatever you want.

â€ Oh, hey!
â€ What's up, baby? You coming tonight?

â€ Oh, shit, dude.
I'm so sorry. I can't.

â€ What? You have to.
â€ No, I'm grounded tonight.

â€ Right, so just sneak out.
â€ I just told you that I can't.

â€ I am begging you, Mo.
Come on!

â€ Yo, hold on. Whoa.
Is Josh talking to Mr. Clark?

What the fuck is that about?
â€ I don't know, man. It could be anything.

â€ Fuck this, dude.

â€ You're being paranoid, man.
I'm telling you.

â€ Dude, the whole thing
just feels sketchy, okay?

Like, the school's on to us.

I have to sneak out tonight?

Like, it just feels like
I'm the only one taking risks.

â€ We're all taking risks here, baby.
â€ Don't call me baby.

â€ Hey.
â€ Oh, shit.

Fuck.
â€ Okay, listen.

You need to chill the fuck out, all right?

Just calm down. Nobody knows anything.
â€ Hey, keep your voice down.

â€ Okay. All right, fine.
So, we have a deal?

â€ Yeah, fine, but the price is going up.

â€ I fucking love you so much!
I love you! I love you!

â€ Okay, it's fine dude. It's fine.
â€ Oh, yo, can you bring condoms?

â€ What? For who?

â€ Seriously?

â€ You don't even care.

â€ Yo, you've just been

Can you hold on a minute, please?

â€ You want some solid dating advice?

Zeke and I broke up,

you don't wanna hang out with me anymore?

â€ You and Zeke broke up?

â€ He was cheating on me.

â€ Oh, um...

That sucks.
I'm sure he didn't mean to do that.

â€ You know what's crazy?

We've known each other for so long

Yeah. Yeah, that is weird.

â€ How are things with the girlfriend?

â€ Uhâ€huh. I don't even wanna think about

the other shit
I probably don't know about.

â€ That'd be best.

â€ Look, it's obvious he hangs out with you
so that he can feel cool.

But one day he's gonna wake up and realize

that you're just hanging out with him
because you need to feel cool too.

And then he won't 'cause he's the last
person on Earth who thinks that you are.

Dude, what are you doing?

â€ That was what you took
from what I just said?

â€ I love you a lot.

â€ What?
â€ Why would I want to kiss you?

What the hell is your problem?

â€ Wait, but I justâ€â€ I apologized.

â€ Yeah, so? You're a dick!

And you're fucking sketchy.
You're like a child drug dealer.

You let everyone use you.

You're the guy with the bag.
That's weird.

â€ Yeah, but we kissed.

â€ Yeah. I liked you.
I don't like you anymore.

â€ [stammering] Wait, are you joking?
'Cause I can honestly never tell.

OFFICER: [knocking]
Monroe Harris, are you in there?

Open the door.
This is the police.

â€ Danny, fuck off, okay?

â€ I don't think that's a kid.
OFFICER: Open the door!

Open this door right now!
â€ Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

â€ You locked the door?

â€ Yeah, I kinda thought
this was gonna go better.

â™ª

OFFICER: Do not make this worse.
â€ I'm opening it.

â€ No, no, no, Sophie.
Please, give me a minute, okay?

â€ What the fuck is going on?

â€ Look, I do this all the time, okay?
It's fine, I do this at home. It's fine.

OFFICER: Open this door!
â€ What the fuck!

OFFICER:
I'm not gonna ask again!

â€ This isn't me, I swear.
â€ Are you killing yourself?

[pounding on door]

BOY:
Hey, are you okay?

OFFICER: Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

â™ª <i>Where the boys are</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Someone waits for me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>A smiling face, a warm embrace</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Two arms to hold me tenderly</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Where the boys are</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>My true love will be</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>He's walking down some street in town</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>And I know he's looking there for me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>'Til he holds me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I wait impatiently</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Where the boys are</i>
<i>Where the boys are</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Where the boys are</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>Someone waits</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>For me</i> â™ª

[song ends]

â€ I'm so fuckin' screwed, man.

I mean, think about it.
They know my name, they know where I live.

They can find me!

And I can't stay here forever.

â€ Ah, dude, relax.
You're fine.

â€ Yo, shut the fuck up, dude.
That's easy for you to say.

You've literally never cared
how this was going to end for me.

And I have to fucking move now!
I have to change my name!

My fucking parents, dog!

[softly crying]

â€ Hey, don't beat yourself up over this.
This is not a big deal.

You're 16.
â€ [crying]

â€ Dude.

You serious right now?
Come on.

â€ I justâ€â€
I don't wanna end up like you, man.

â€ That's a bad thing?

â€ Yeah, it's a fuckin' nightmare.

â€ Oh.

All right, yeah.

You're not gonna end up like me.
You're good, man.

â€ Look at me, dude, I'm alreadyâ€â€
I'm already like you.

It's already happened.
Iâ€I sold drugs...

Sophie won't even talk to me.

My friends just use me for alcohol,
my parents hate me.

I hooked up with Holly.

â€ What?

Like...?

Oh.

Wow.

Fuckin' bitch.

Like sex?


Word. Mmmm.

Sick! You lost your virginity, eh?

â€ I know, dude, and...

I wanted to tell you really fuckin' badly,
but it was to your girlfriend.

â€ Yeah, yeah.
I can imagine how that could be rough.

Mmm.

Come here, bro.
Come over here.

I love you, fuckin' idiot.


Stop crying.
It's weird.

We don't cry in this house.
We do drugs in this house.


You're good, dude.
You're not gonna get in trouble.

â€ What am I gonna do, dude?

â€ Tell the fucking cops.
Just be like, "Hey, um..."

Just blame it on me. Just be like,
I sold you alcohol and drugs

and all that nonsense.
Whatever, it's cool.

â€ [scoffs]
Really? Just like that?

â€ Yeah. What are they gonna do to me?
Look at where I live.

What's the worst that could happen?
Take my DMX poster and fucking...

You're cool, man.

Just get outta here
before I change my mind.

â€ No.

â€ Huh?
â€ No.

No, I can't do it.
â€ What do you mean no?

â€ I think this is my fault, and I...

I gotta own it.

â€ Nah, bro, we got this.

Yo, one time me and Nick,
we got a wholeâ€â€

â€ You've done enough.

ZEKE: Mo!

â™ª

REUBEN: Hey! Morning!
SHERRI: Hi, sweetie.

â€ Hey.
REUBEN: Uh, movie tonight?

â€ Yeah. Sounds good.

REUBEN: Oh! Okay.
SHERRI: Are you hungry?

â€ No, I'm good. Thanks.

SHERRI: Hey.

You okay?
â€ Mmâ€hmm. Yeah.

PRINCIPAL: Monroe.

â™ª


â€ Yo. What up?

â€ Stay away from my son.

â€ Huh?

I'm not gonna stay away from Mo.
You're not my dad.

You can't tell me what to do.

What the fuck?
What's up?

The fuck?!

Ow!

What's your problem, bro?

â€ I have no idea what it is about you
that he finds so special.

I really don't.

And I think about it all the time.

I mean...

What, because you let him smoke and drink?
I mean...

Was I supposed to do that?

I'm his father.

For the record, I don't blame you.
I can't.

But Mo is nothing like you.

And he should've known better.

So, do me a favor and just,
you know, leave my son

and my daughter and my whole family
the fuck alone.

MO: Dad.
â€ I told you to stay in the car!

â€ I got expelled.

â™ª

â€ Don't tell your mom
about that, okay?

â™ª

RECEPTIONIST:
Monroe.

â€ Bye, Rhonda.
â€ See you Thursday.

â€ Hi, can I get a, um,
a number nine with no pickles, please?

DRIVEâ€THRU WORKER:
<i>That'll be $8.21. Second window.</i>

â€ Okay. Thank you.

ZEKE: Oh, shit! Momo!
â€ Zeke?

â€ [softly crying]
I don't know what I'm gonna do, man.

He was my best friend.
I lost my best friend, man.

I don't know.

Fuck!

What a fucking good dog.

Huh? Whatâ€whatâ€what do you think?

â€ Yeah, that was all right.

â€ That was great!
That was likeâ€like Oscar stuff.

You know, like Chalamet or something.

â€ Oh, definitely.

â€ Yeah.

â€ So, how long you been working here?
â€ Um...

â€ Like two weeks.
Something like that. Yeah.

â€ Yeah, cool. Good for you, man.
â€ Thank you.

â€ I see you're going by your full name.

â€ Oh, yeah, got me.
It's corporate here, you know?

Big company. Just wanna look good.
It's professional, you know.

I told you,
everything always works out.

It always works out.
Look at us.

â€ I mean, sort of. You know,
I mean, I did have to switch schools.

And my mom cried for a month straight.

And I can only drive the car to go
to community service or pee in a cup.

â€ Right. But... but...

â€ Yeah?
â€ We have...

a memory. We have a memory
that we get to share together.

â€ Not a lot of people get that, right?
â€ Mmâ€hmm.

â€ Yeah. Mmm.
â€ Sure.

â€ Yo, did I tell you?
I wrote a script!

Like, a movie. Like, yeah...
â€ No way!

â€ Yeah!
â€ Did you actually?

â€ Yeah, yeah. It's like
a horrorâ€actionâ€comedy type thing.

And, uh, there's actually
a character in it based off you.

I think you'd like it.
â€ Yeah, can I read it sometime?

â€ I haven't written it actually yet.
It's in my head right now.

It's in that process.

But I will write it down.
I heard that is the easiest part.

So, yeah, we'll cross that bridge
when it comes.

â€ Cool.
â€ Very cool.

â€ Yeah.
â€ Yeah.

So, uh, what are you doing later?
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

You wanna hang out or something?

â€ No, I sort of have to hang out
with my parents tonight.

You know.

But, uh, yo, you wanna come?

â€ Ha! No thanks.
Yeah, I get it. Um...

Okay, if not, maybe tomorrow?

I'm off tomorrow actually.
Tomorrow's better. Tomorrow?

â€ Sure. Maybe. Yeah.
â€ Cool.

â€ I'll, uh, I'll let you know.
â€ Okay.

â€ All right, I guess somebody
who works here will fix that.

See you tomorrow?
â€ Yeah, I'll see you around, man.

â€ Tight. I'll walk you out. Come on.
