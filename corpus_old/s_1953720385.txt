<i> I called Aaron Milton. </ i>
<i> whole family are engineers. </ i>

<i> Several generations of nerds. < / i>
<i> Understand me right, I'm not bitter. </ i>

<i> We are good to find out </ i>
<i> how things work. </ i>

<i>  I have other interests. </ i>
<i> In the past it has caused problems. </ i>

It's pretty basic.

Quantitative chemical analysis,
Applied Physics, -

Technology II,
Technical Mathematics II.

You skip the first semester.
That's my boy, that.

And  electives have you...
What did I do now that I selected?

What about arts and crafts?

There is a fine university,
is not a summer camp.

Here it is.
"Integrated Design II"

Honestly, Phil.
Now we'll make it.

I can be calculated Jupiter landing,
so I can run uphill.

You've known it for months.
It's a simple equation.

That's why I divorced myself from your father.

Look at this.

Is it or Woodstock?

My God, they're so young.

Seven out of ten have had intercourse.

Four out of ten use drugs.
One in ten is gay.

What is left then?

Me.

Is that all you get
for $ 35,000?

A cell?
It's not so bad.

Take the furthest away from the door.
It's safer.

I bring anything to your room.

To my little scout!
Did you hit it?

Have not been good?
I have something more.

Some have rich parents.
You did earn it.

But it does not have
to hang on the wall.

Lawyers do, dentists.
Even my gynecologist.

Then I get a receptionist
and a diary.

Perkins 101?
Ja... Hey.

What's going on?
My name is Aaron.

These are my parents.
My name is William.

You can call me Will or Bill
or whatever.

Fiona here
call me Wild Bill.

I met just her parents.
"When I take over, mother."

It is the
we've worked for all these years.

We?

I should have kept up a year.
You're only 17 years old.

I have really wrapped things up.

What are you talking about?

Do not make the same mistake as me.

What error?
What are you talking about? Dad!

Women or snopper?

What?
Like chicks or snopper?

Women.
Yeah. I just fucked.

Can you trick with the door handle?
No.

If you have someone with you in the room,
and will not be disturbed, -

so use the door handle.
Attach a tie on, you know the other -

that it is busy.
"Come back later."

Can not we just
put a note on the door?

"It's busy., We fuck?"
No, we could have a code.

"Zebra Tango Niner"
or something.

Shit. Do I teach a virgin?
No, I'm not a virgin.

Do not smell the new car.
When scares you away pussy.

I am not a virgin!
Okay. Do not flip out.

Just remember the trick with the door handle.
My brother is studying at Columbia.

It works.

Okay.

What about this one?

Perverse, your Scoutmaster.
I like it.

<i> Attached is a map of </ i>
<i> female genitalia. </ I>

<i> Please keep in mind </ i>
<i> the red area called "clitoris ". </ i>

<i> Its location </ i>
<i> is a bit illogical, - </ i>

<i> but it is the key </ i>
<in > woman's satisfaction. </ i>

<i> Had I known it a little before, </ i>
<i> could have saved my marriage. </ I>

Is the science library on the map?

Hi... Perkins?

No, Aaron.

Perkins, the Senate.
You live there, right?

Yes, yes. How do you know?
I live on the same floor.

I saw you on the way to the shower.
Ok...

My name is Darcy.
Aaron. Hey.

I have already said.
There it is.

'll See.

By the way...
Nice bathrobe.

Congratulations, you have been raised
on my design seminar.

Only the very best fit.

See you around well.

Most people here think
that they can walk on water.

And you know what?

When this seminar is finished
you get the opportunity to prove it.

Everyone must create a device as
you can walk on water in the swimming pool.

You should design it, build it
and compete with it.

When the semester is finished,
<i> would you like 20 year olds cope </ i>

as Jesus did before he was 30

You can start by looking at
good old Archimedes...

Why can not I change electives?

Do you know how many students had
killed to make room on my team?

You are the only first-year student.
You can do this here.

It's a waste of time to drawing.
It can already.

How do you know?
I was the one who got you into.

Some of my colleagues thought
that you were too young.

And your mother said
that you have some social problems.

If you want to talk about...
Does my mom talked to you?

You can say it all.
I'm good.

I've even gone to college.
A drawing courses can not hurt.

Why I chose you?
I love finding out how things work.

And so do you.
You'll love the class.

Sorry.
You're late.

I have gone away.
I thought it was an engineer hour.

Do you always take with you sketchbook di
to the engineer class?

It looks like you have talent.
I want to have simple, clean lines.

Draw what you see.

Sorry.
Sit there.

Look at it positively.

You are certainly not flauere
than this in your whole life.

You should just know...

Well done, mr. Milton.
But that's not what I asked for.

Clean and simple...

My God, it's just so cool.

Wait, Da Vinci!

Why such a hurry?
I'll have chemistry.

I should have psychology. If we shirk
and take a caffeine drop?

One can then not shirk first week.

Can not?

This is really awesome.

Thanks.

Okay.
Well, but... may I ask -

how to...
Was a freshman?

I mean...
You're a freshman, right?

I have been caught up as everyone
other. You thought I was favored?

No, but you're...
Beautiful and talented?

You're just...
Just ask then.

Absolutely no censorship.

Without tribe. Lighthouses loose.

Why do you do this?
That's a good question. Direct.

You have real talent.
Talented people will blurt out.

Drop manners.
This is how you set the a question.

"Linda, you are at least
10 years older than the rest."

"What makes
an old chick like you here?"

It was not what I wanted...
That's what you thought.

I thought it that way.
Who are you trying to protect?

Say I had three breasts -

think you not that I knew it
before someone said that to me?

You are polite for your own sake.
Not mine, the trebrystede berta.

<i> Archimedes sat in the bath </ i>
<i> when he saw the light. </ I>

<i> Think of volume. </ I>
<i> Think of buoyancy. </ i>

<i> You have the entire semester to build </ i>
<i> their water times. </ i>

<i> But it is </ i>
<i> 95 percent of their character. </ i>

It's a tradition here at Perkins.
Is there one that has a tape measure?

When we use a ruler.

Can you do this somewhere else?

When it is your turn.
We lack only two, -

so we can officially appoint
Perkins' biggest dick.

It is not the greatest,
only the longest.

Shut up!
He's right.

We also need to measure around...
No, you can not.

Then measure the circumference just one place.
Okay sir engineer.

How do we measure as best
our penises?

We measure
best volume by displacement.

Imagine a beer mug
filled with water.

One takes the object into the mug
and measure how much water is left.

There are only a couple of hitches to it.

There's something about the angle of
and a beer mug.

And who should then check it?

I could just pour out some water.
"My dick is huge!"

Someone should check it out.
Fuck volume.

When it's your turn, rain stick.
No, I sit and read.

You want us out of here
so you can read?

Measure your penis.
No! I do not measure my dick.

<i> You have real talent. </ I>
Yes, I have.

<i> Nice bathrobe. </ I>
<i> Three breasts. </ I>

<i> Perkins </ i>

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU ARE KING!

COLLEGE MEASURE THE TAURUS

where we got you, buddy.

16 centimeters. There are certain
a bit above average.

Next week we see
who has the biggest balls!

Do you have dinner plans
tomorrow night?

No...
I eat well in the cafeteria.

Could you imagine getting
and get some real food?

I make lasagne.
It's better than sex.

You world.
Embarrassed You?

No. No, then.

I said "better than sex".
Not "prelude to sex."

You are the scarlet.
Hold up.

It goes well.

<i> Come. It is Hawaii party </ i>
<i> out by the showers. </ I>

Five dollars.

Was not your name Darcy?
Jo.

Aaron?

Nice shirt.

My God! You've mastered while
repulsion and attraction.

With tongue!
In English, Aaron.

It's impossible.

So it's your turn.

There must be something you can.

I can conjure up his roommate.
Hail, Hell residents.

Who's your little delicate mimosa?
Should it be funny?

Is Darcy.
It's my roommate William.

Wild Bill. A pleasure.
Yes, yes.

Do not be so astringent.
You do not have so much to offer.

I'll see you, Aaron.
Cheers.

What is it with you?

Darcy!

I'm sorry, he's an idiot.

Excuse. I may seem like a male chauvinist
, -

But if you get to know me,
I am an ok guy.

Great.

This here is memories.

He is pure caveman.
Is he your friend?

No. roommate. Big Difference.
How do you keep utmed him?

I'm sorry.
He â€‹â€‹has some sick ideas about girls.

Women, Aaron.
I'm sorry.

"Women" makes me think of my mother's friends
. We lack a word.

He is wrong.

You have plenty to offer.

Thanks.

You could also have these books.
Why are you reading that?

One must still have...

Do not say that you have a date?

I have not actually...
Above average.

Who is your secret girlfriend?
She's gorgeous, yes!

And old.

And leaking.

You never told me about
thus to be an old lady.

Oh, that...
Yes, I am a mature student.

Yes, yes, that makes me sound like an old
cheese.

No, but that thing when
put to school again.

So what did you...
When you were away from school?

I lived only in the world.

It was not exactly in the cards
that I should have an education, -

as it certainly makes for some.

I decided not
to grow up in a pale.

Just grab a beer.
I take a quick shower.

Who the hell are you?
What?

Who the hell are you?

My name is Aaron.

Going on romantic dinner?

No, just lasagne.

Lasagne?
When it is in the box, dude.

When Linda stock
lasagne she ends always in bed.

Why do we have this conversation?
Because your fat ass is here.

So you can not talk to me?
Yes, but it must be so belligerent?

Belligerent... Where did that word,
college kid? Did you hit it?

Linda teeth maybe
a large vocabulary -

but I do not light it.

What are you?
Her daughter?

I'm Beth. Her roommate.

Cut out your horny bitch!

If there is a problem,
I can just go.

Nice. Stitching for Christmas.
Okay. In like manner.

Wow, that was tame.
"In like manner"?

I know you do not even,
but you talk too much.

Damn you, Aaron.
Fuck you and a big, fat stick.

Damn you, Beth.
Fuck you with the whole tree.

So you have greeted each other?

You should have told you have a daughter.
Have not I?

No. It has not.

She is just starting in the ninth.
And it's Cleopatra.

They greeted each other.

Thanks for the wine, Aaron.
Was the screw cap stock?

He damn well.
Speak nicely, Beth.

Okay. He does not care.
Ok, a little taste.

Thanks.

Do not you want anything?
Linda does not drink.

Did not she say that?
Now hold it.

Excuse.

I did not know... Excuse me.

Aaron, you are so polite again.
I love to have wine on the table, -

but not in my glass.

Sometimes I feel that I
I fit in there.

Thou perfect.
You are outstanding.

Because she is old?
No! Look at her.

Linda gets the other college girls
to resemble craze aunts.

She has confidence,
she is full of life.

Speaking always as an old man?

Do you think she's hot?
She has unfortunately inherited my mouth.

And your exuberance.
What the hell does it mean?

He says you are leaking.

Tell me you blush?
No.

He does.

Come on. Dance with me.
No.

I do not dance.
I thought you'd never ask.

Then it's you. Come.

You have to.

I should have brought sangria.

Come here.
Who's on the couch?

My God!

Do not say I miss this...

Cut it out.
I know you're awake.

Can you believe this?

Do they do that often?
Oh. Neighbors complain.

I'd better go.
So boring you are.

Hold up!

What was that?

Sleep well, moron.

Glad you could come...
I'm sorry.

You look worn out.
If you only knew...

You need some home cooking
and a soft bed.

What are you doing?
Put some value.

No, do not.
We are going to jail. Do not do it!

Are you aware
how fast you were driving?

Obviously not fast enough, handsome.
I throw your ass in jail.

You can also just
give me a round in my apartment.

Is that him?

He's just a kid.

Where are your manners?
Aaron, right? My name is Wes.

Hello.
I have a few clams to you.

What the hell was that?

Cheers.

Sample this one.

God.
It's gorgeous.

So you are a police officer?

Was it because of the
police car or uniform?

Earth call Wes.
He â€‹â€‹tries to converse.

I do that too. What keeps you young
at university about her?

You thought at first she was a teacher?

None particularly note
at her. We are so different.

Are you?
Are there similar to me?

No way! They take
not up losers and skinheads.

Now, do not hurt me.
You can not be wounded.

Do not let her treat you like a friend.

Look.

Do not let her get away with it.
When she starts talking about guys, -

so set your foot down.
You are not her friend.

Put â€‹â€‹your hands off me, you bastard!
Otherwise I blow your head off.

Now she fucking quit!
Watch your language!

Your daughter is aiming at me,
but I have to watch my language?

Give me the gun.
What are you doing with it?

Robbing a bank. Just give me the...

I should hide seen.
You know what? Give me that.

There were bullets in this time, Wes.
Was it?

Do not you dare.

Wes! For fuck!

If she continues like this,
she ends of the cage.

Take Aaron and buy the cakes.

And Cigarettes!

How old are you?
13? 14?

Significantly older than you.
How do you come up to it?

I have lived in hundeÃ¥r.
Woof.

Hey, Ray Ray. What's going on?
Hey, Beth. Not much.

This is my cousin Winn.
He â€‹â€‹goes on fabric.

My uncle gives him college apparel
and hope the Straits him.

So stupid.
Fight it, man.

I just take one day at a time.

Can I get a package mentolrÃ¸yk -

and some cream puffs?
Five or six pieces.

Fair.

When shall we meet?
Have a little party?

You're too old for me.

Your cousin Winn?
I just wanted to lighten the mood.

I have some gifts for you.

Stole from him?

You are totally inexperienced, what?
What?

You are inexperienced, like me.
No, I am not.

Do not be embarrassed. I think it's sweet.
You're not like the rest of the wolves.

You should not set limits
in my home.

I do not want to lose her.

It takes enough a while.
Now you're stuck with me.

It does not matter.

Do you...
Do you live here?

Yeah, would not you done?
I swiped it right away.

What are you drawing?

You.

Stop looking at me like that.
It scares me.

Can I see it?

Just find the page.

Come on in.

Hello.

I'm so...
Come in and sit down.

Talk to me.
I do not bite.

I just thought that with Wes.
Do not worry about him.

He does not believe in
that men and women can be friends.

Although
are attracted to each other, so what?

But Wes does not understand it.

Is there an attraction here?

Between you and me?

Well, you are appealing in a way that
Wes never.

You are sexy between the ears.

Should imagine a compliment?

That's when the worst
you could say to me.

There is definitely a compliment.
Do you think that I'm attractive?

Ja...
I thought it was obvious.

I do not know.
I think I look all right.

But in a 17-year-old eyes
I can just be like Queen Elizabeth.

It's probably not a problem.
Trust me.

I trust you. I tend not to invite
young guys in the bedroom.

There is no endowment.

It said the study office.

We should stop here
before it becomes serious.

We should stop.
We should stop.

Vent. What am I doing?

I'm so hopeless.
I will not spoil it here.

Go. It is an order.

Ok.

Good night.

You can do it, Aaron.
Yes, I just have to think about.

There is nothing to wonder about.
Whether you can or you can not.

That's the great thing about our discipline.

I'm really sorry,
but fails in this way.

I must first see it for myself.

You do not until you have something on the blackboard.

SURFACE TENSION?
Skater?

Skater

Perkins?

Hello, Perkins...

Wake up.

The library closes.
Shall we have a cup of coffee?

Cheers.
Cheers.

But...

Not that it's my business,
you just have to stop me, but...

... I've heard
that you are with a married woman.

Really?
Have you heard?

A married woman with children.

I've even heard that one of them was your
, but I do not believe.

I did not think anyone knew who I was
.

Everyone at Perkins know.

I'm so protagonist
in some other rumors about you.

I'm flattered.
You will not tell me...

No. That is not true.
What is right?

There with the married woman.

She has only one child.
It's not mine.

I have taken paternity test.
There was then a relief.

Do you sleep there?
Yes.

It is easier.
She drives me back in the morning.

Yes, it rhymes jo...

But how do you sleep then?

Bill will enter.

Who's in there? The hot mom?
Damn! Respect handkerchief.

Hurry!
I would enter the room.

I do not like hair removal.
It's terrible.

It's okay.
I did not ask for your approval.

Did I say something wrong?

Have you ever been with a natural woman?

I do not know what that means.

You do not have to shave, -

and I hope you are intelligent enough
not to expect it of me.

I have not thought about it.
You certainly do not handle it?

What is it?
I... We talk maybe too much.

This Barbie doll walking, talking,
farting and underarm hair.

If you do not like it,
, you should have taken the other model.

Excuse !
Come, Darcy.

Wait then. Darcy!
Come on, then!

Damn.

You should buy boxer shorts.
Take her!

What are you doing here?

Do not look.

I came because...

This here makes me absolutely crazy.

What?
Not dork. Fucking her?

Who?
Linda, you fool!

Why rake it up?
You can not just come here.

Because...

... I love you.

No, you do not.
Yes, I do.

How can you know that?

You have this effect on me.

Every time you come into the room
traveling hairs on my arms.

As a charge.
A charge?

And then I totally weird in the stomach, -

And I have to...
It is a bit embarrassing, go to the toilet.

So I'm a laxative?
Yes.

And what is love?
What else you call it?

Try to go for a walk on
pharmacy and ask for some stomach-regulating.

I knew you would make fun of me.

I will not hurt you,
but you're 14!

I do not date a 14-year-old.
So do not date me.

So just lie to me.
No, Beth!

You will be the first.
No, stop.

You will be the first.
Stop.

What are you doing?
Go away!

Now What?
You are the only one who understands me.

What the hell?!
No! No! No!

It...

It's not what it looks like.
3 to 5 years of community service?

Hello. My name is Beth.

Dattera?!
Beth, go left your jumper.

What was your name?
Wild Bill.

Wild? Really?
Pull back the sweater.

Give me your keys. Come on!

Your roommate is a bit sweet.
Shut up.

Hello, beautiful.
I have on the little blue as you like, -

and right now they are
overflowing.

Pardon?

This is Susan Milton.
I will talk with my son.

Excuse.
I thought it was...

I want to talk to him now.

He is not in the room right now.
Can I take a message?

Yes. It's for you.

I hear not of him in
a day, I hold you responsible.

I'm with.
Will do.

Talk. Goodbye.

No.

Do you never bit easy?
Respect handkerchief.

It is your own words.

Fuck handkerchief.
It is also my words.

It should not.

Well done, Milton!

You all right, mate?
No.

No, I am not.
Use me. I'm actually an expert.

No, it's not.

For it is not about to fuck.

It may sound silly,
but I'm certainly in love.

She is a child!

No, not her. Her mother.
The education I'd had.

Maybe she's sexual science
finest universities.

Just like Yale.

Is she interested in you?

Yes. No.

I do not know.
It's complicated.

She's in a relationship.
A relationship?

With a cop.
You're in deep water.

Unfortunately, there is no improvement.
Very well, Mr....

Aaron Milton.

Writing style must be sanded a bit on,
but your arguments are outstanding.

But one thing worries me.
Yes?

You are not enrolled in the course.


Be honest.
What was wrong with my style?

Analysis lacked depth, shades...

What is it you like
of Greek tragedy?

I love women.

They are ballknusere.
They are strong and principled.

Intense.

Fuck with you, and she tears your heart out and leave
your friends eat there.

But you treat her well
she gives you the planets, gods, -

Heaven and Earth.

She can change your life.
I can hear your passion.

But there's just not enough.
Not here.

Give me a chance.

I have seen this play out
again and again.

You can not measure up with them.

You know me not.
Yes, I do.

I have a student
like you every semester.

You know what?
Fuck you.

Maybe it's just someone who does not
fits into a nice university.

Who said that? A stupid professor
with a Doric column up the ass?

Yes, that's right.

Do not let him touch you down like that.

It's not just him.
It's me.

I thought it would be different here.

Different than all the other
I have tried.

But it's the same story over again.
Just smarter assholes.

I'll help you hide.

With whatever.

You are cute.

The last night...

I will not talk about it.
What are you doing here?

Can not your cousin and you
come up to me?

I have some friends visiting.
It's so funny.

No, I have to do homework.
Take them. So, I help you.

Will you be my tutor?
Something like that.

What do you say, little man?
It's not up to me.

Maybe another time.

Thanks for the extra topping.
Just say so.

Why do you expose me for this?

It is not a felony,
just a little pot.

Does your mother there?
It is not her case.

I do not think a 14-year-old to smoke pot.

Or go with weapons.
Or have sex, for that matter.

But it's ok to wash
mother when she has done in his pants?

What are you talking about?
Bathing her, patching the lips.

Rolling her around the page
so she gets strangled in vomiting.

I was six or seven years.

Can you give me a light?

Can you now better imagine
the good old days?

Before we moved here.
Before Linda was a model student.

Sorry. I did not know.
No, you do not know Linda.

It's not a pretty sight.

Can not you live with your grandmother
in Jacksonville?

At ayatollahs?

She's quite a lady.
No thanks.

Henne we will never return to.

Well... you will have a draft?
No.

Figured well there.

Canceled , we tell you of something?
Driver you with a little couch gymnastics?

Well... see something new?

Wes...

It's okay.
Tampen burner.

God.

What?! What the fuck?

I marry your mother.
Maybe, Wes.

It is not true!

Is that the best you can?
Ask her.

Is that the best you can?

For shit.

No, no, we've talked about it.
I'll take care of it. Relax.

What the hell are you doing?
You can not just go up here.

Calm down, Beth.
Have you learned it at a police course?

"Calm down, Beth."

Do not do this to your mother.
You can not tell me. Out!

Is that what you want?
I do not know.

I have not said yes yet.

He insisted.

He said I should try to see how it feels
.

And?

It stops blood flow.

You never our family.

Damn you!

Hold Now shut up, otherwise I dry
the grin off your face.

Are you afraid that Linda hear me?
Get lost, you piece of shit, -

otherwise I'm sticking out
eyes on you!

It was good.
You think?

Stop.
Let go of me.

Get off me!

Wes? Wes!
Leave her alone.

The little bitch has provoked me long enough.

Wake up your hands.
Are you kidding me? No, no...

End!
Hold up!

Let me.

Oh god, Linda.

Get out of my house.
You know I meant it.

Now!

Thank you for driving me home.
I would not even married.

Why would you do that?

Do you plan to see him again?
What do you think?

<i> Pull over. </ I>
That's not true.

He can go to hell.

I do not stop, you bastard.

<i> Pull over now. </ I>
Damn.

Slow down, Linda!
<i> I detain you. </ I>

You do not.

Slow down!

What are you doing?

Watch out!

Hello.

Say that he is ok.
Is he ok?

How can you worry about him?
Not Wes.

Dog.

See how you look.
And so are you worried about your dog?

It ran away.
It's okay.

Are you okay?
It's all my fault.

No, it's not.

No, it's not.

No.

No, it's... I can not...
Sorry.

Do not go.

Do not you with her?

So stay with me.
Please?

Structure seems solid.

Wait, do not say anything.

There should be a skater?

It looks a little strange...
Not weirder than this.

Aaron, this is an outstanding
subscription of English anchor time.

Macabre, but outstanding.

How can one with such great visions
struggle so much with the calculations?

You came here because you have talent
. I committed a big mistake?

I do not think he will be happy for this there.

Is there
you take all your phones?

What's going on here?
Sorry. I tried to stop them.

What really happened?
Was she drunk? Went on drugs?

It was an accident.
It was sake.

I will hide
know what a 17-year-old boy-

make a car
with a woman in the 30s!

She is my friend.
Is she your friend?

If that's what you want to believe...
Dad, she is a student.

She has helped me a lot.
You should meet her.

I will not pay for this!
I have struggled to get into.

Will you throw me out again?
Because I'm friends with a woman?

It's crazy!

It does not hurt to see her.

Are they here?
Not yet.

What did you call this?
A karryrett.

You've never tasted it before?
I use curry, but not like that.

It's festive.
There are Indian. Not Indian.

I know. It is neither
maize or Indian beads i

I think it's lovely.
Where did you two meet, Linda?

We go to the same art class.
Is not it a bit inconvenient?

We have all hobbies, but...
It is perhaps for me.

But when you have such great talent
as your son, it is worth gold.

What is so cool about being an engineer?
That one can sit in tjenestebil?

I do not think that's what they do.
No, but he is a great artist.

Give him a chance.
Maybe hen is the next Picasso.

There are not many Picasso.

And the rest starve.
It's not good enough for my son.

Your friend Linda is...

... A wonderful woman.

Oh, she's gorgeous?
Yes.

I think that too.

You got yourself some scratch, what?
I'm much better already.

How many accidents have there been in your life?

Pardon?

Many, I believe.
I'll go with dessert.

The boy in there know nothing.

You get him enough
to feel special.

As a real casanova.

I see right through you.
It makes enough adult men too.

It is easier to fold over the children.

Now hold it.
You are the mother.

Let me ask you
from one mother to another...

If you saw your baby on the way downhill
cliff, would you stop it?

I got it.

Now it's war.

So, who wants to dance?

With your neck and arm
it's probably not that smart.

Phil, you look like a samba champion.

Yes, stand on the Paps!

I see that you are enjoying this.

No thanks.
Tough.

What is going on?

What the hell?
This can not be happening.

Does she have something going on with him?

With who?
The old she dances with!

He shall receive.
The experienced min.

It's a long story.
What do you want?

I will make amends.
I would still marry her.

I would wait
to book the church.

It's best you go.
I will say that you asked her.

What...

Thanks, sweet.

What has just happened?

Your son just asked
a cop to go.

Now we go.
But we have it's funny.

Does it look like I'm having fun?
Do not make me ask again.

Stay away from my son,
otherwise I tear you to pieces.

Ask him what he wants.
I do not care!

I know what he needs.

I'll show you
what he needs.

Phil!

Go home, Susan. Your son is cute and sexy and
have talent.

Once you are off you go
for him, he is unstoppable.

Now you hear anything else.

Phil here is a delicacy.
He â€‹â€‹could easily lit, -

if you had blood in your body
instead of coolant.

For God's sake, what...
Salaam, Susan.

It say in India
when guests visit.

Take your coat.

No, I'm staying.
You're coming home with your family.

The  sleeves like a family to me.

The sleeves as a family
than you are.

Will your new family pay
university, rent and food?

Say something to your son, then!

Stay here.

I'd done.
Asshole.

What happened to you?
I do not know you anymore.

No, you do not.

Salaam, Mom.

Sorry that we have destroyed your life.

You are in love with her, right?

I knew.

My mom just run
away with everything I have.

I am not so romantic now.
You kissed her back.

You think I'm blind?
It was nothing.

I actually hurt your mother.
Why?

You chose the one that my mother
in front of her. It must sting.

There he is, yes.

Come here.

Wes...

Wes...

Aaron?
Yes?

Excuse...
I dreamed.

I did too.

Hello.

Just tuned.

Wait a minute. Are you sure?
Yes. Oh my God!

God.

God.

What? What is it?
You have to be quiet.

God, Wes.

It's me, Aaron.
What are you talking about?

Does not matter.
What is your problem?

Who were you in bed with?
To hell, then.

What have we done?

Do nothing big deal out of this.

We're just friends who fuck.
And it was miserable.

Okay? Ops.

Hold up.
I did not mean it like that.

It did not look right.

Aaron...
Hold up.

Have you ever loved a
instead of fuck?

For the sugar sweet...
Yes, I've loved with someone.

How did it feel?
Very much like to fuck.

Do not come back.

Go away and never came back!
Just go!

Cut out, Beth.
You got what you came for. Insert.

You do not know anything about.
Linda eaten pills like candy.

She is going down.
I have seen it before.

You do not know shit.

She's just pain.
I promise that she is well again in a couple of weeks.

Do not promise anything. People are
shit bad at keeping promises.

People do not care.

I come in, Bill.
You idiot!

Damn you! I'm tired.
I want to sleep.

I'm finished with this!

It was not the intention.
We just sat and talked, and then...

Can not you just shut up?
We sat and talked about you.

It was only
why she even bothered to talk to me.

So I fuck with a
which I think is another, -

while fucks with a
who thinks of me.

It's so fucked up!

Now, are you lost?
Have you finally gotten to you?

Was it mom?

I did not mean your mother.
God, how did it anyway?

Can you imagine that?

I have no clothes, no friends
, -

I have no family,
and ten o'clock in the morning -

I will bring mathematical proof
I can walk on water.

If I fuck it,
I can wave goodbye to the trust fund-

and goodbye to the university.

Now you need to pull yourself together.
I do not like others say more.

From now on, I do
I even want to.

As soon as I know what it is.

Well, when there came
something on the blackboard...

Is this just a joke to you?

It's these numbers
you are looking for.

Not quite. Just because you give me
skater...

I assume it's me?

Even with skater legs
I do not get their speed.

They turn gravity, because the
goes 100 body lengths per second.

So one of my size have...

... Go with 645 km per hour.

But maybe you can move
so fast? Can you, Aaron?

There is still hope.
You could lose 64 kg.

How much do you weigh?

66 kg.
What?

It is a day of competition.

You can go. See you at the pool
tomorrow at nine.

Hey, Aaron. </ I>
<i> Is Beth with you? </ I>

<i> Then you must let me know. </ I>
<i> must know where she is. </ i>

Did not she say something?

She packed her bags and said
that I would not look for her.

Why are you here?

What the hell do I do?

Call the police, the hospital!
Behave as if you care!

Beth is much stronger than me.
She'll be fine.

Can it?
She's 14!

She is only 14 years.

Has it not occurred to you
that there may have been something to her?

That you may never
get to see her again?

What are you doing?
It's pitiful.

Where is Ray Ray?
It's his night off.

Damn. He promised me cream puffs.
With some extra topping, you know.

He's up there.

Can we help you?

I mean it.
Who the hell are you?

Where do you think you are going?
Come here, buddy!

Your nanny has certainly arrived.

Do you know how old she is?
She knows what she's doing.

She is 14,
half as old as you.

And you are half as big as me.
I can crush you anyway.

It's not just about size.
Do you know the leverage effect?

What are you talking about?

You are full of surprises, cousin.

Stop! Let him go!

Get rid of him.
Aaron!

Beth!

Have a nice evening.

You are not true.

What the "sting" you do not understand? "

Now I'll help you...
Namely. Get lost, or in prison.

You are fucking dead.

What the hell?

Stand over there with their hands in the air
the girl is out.

You heard Batman.
Get out of my room.

You never talk to her.
Understand?

Are you okay?
See you, Beth.

Get her downstairs,
and take care of her.

Come here.

What is it with you?
She's not your daughter.

Remember those balloons
you bought for Linda?

That "good recovery" nonsense?

Sometimes I wonder if
if I had enough of them...

... Then I could fly away?

You are the engineer here.
Can it work?

Yeah, maybe.

I'm so sorry, Beth.

I'm so sorry, dear.

Who's dead?
Hi, Mommy. It's me.

Where are you? Are you ok?
I'm fine.

Surprisingly enough.
How much is it?

<i> Is... </ i>
<i> It's pretty late. </ I>

<i> I just wanted to say </ i>
<i> I'm ok . </ i>

Was that why you called
?

Quite honestly,
you can be pretty annoying.

But you mean it quite well, and I
know you've done a lot for me.

So I try realy
just to say thanks.

I'd call you.
I know.

That's why I called first.

Good night, Mom.
Good night.

Then there's the big day.
Are we ready? It looks like it.

Milton.
Has anyone seen Aaron Milton?

None?

Okay, so get them in the water!

Now you see what you're made of.

On your marks...

Are you ready, engineers?

Let me see you
walk on water!

Who's that over there?

You can do this.

You did it, Aaron.

But it may not be quite the task
spirit.

It did not go well with
diet.

Damn.
Have not they told you?

What is going on?

I was going to call, but...

I would not disturb you
middle of the competition.

No, we must at last not.
But now that you do not disturb, -

so tell me why
everything is packed away.

You were right. It's time
I become a better mother.

I did not want you to move.

I'm moving to Jacksonville
with Beth. We'll be staying with my mother.

So what?
What are you going?

Would you flee from place to place?
I do not know...

But I must do something for Beth.

I do not trust myself
right now.

Here I have no
supporting me.

I'm here.

Yes, and you're swell.

But you can not look after us.
You're 17

You should commit your mistakes.
Do not clean up after mine.

Have you brought with you
my favorite foods?

You are so kind to me.

You fought for us.
And I love you too.

Can not you talk to Beth?
She must know that it is okay that we're leaving.

I'll be brave
and let you go, but how?

Take it easy, I have a plan.

I've thought about it all night
while we packed.

I just need to clear a couple of years,
until I'm 18

Until then, you're an old guy
in the 20s.

You're a hot artist
in New York -

surrounded by groupies and
rÃ¦vslikkere.

But it will not be enough for you.

And then I come.

And you will realize
what's missing in your life.

I really would not
that you travel.

Promise me you will not forget me.
People are the bad shit on promises.

Other people. Not us.

I promise.

Admit it.
This is what you've wanted all along.

Hello, Perkins.

You have a pretty exciting life.

Yes, it has begun
to dawn on me.

And I've figured out your trick
cherry.

You tie the knot
before the stalk in his mouth.

Engineer Hours gives certain results.

Maybe.

I come back to you on that.
