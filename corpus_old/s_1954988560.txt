CROWD: Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.
Do him.

Do him.
Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

You violated the oath.

We manufacture drugs
for other people.

We don't use ourselves.

In doing so, you
have jeopardized

The whole operation.

You know the rules, now
you must be punished.

CROWD: Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

Do him.

I'm not hooked, man.

Listen to me.

I can stop anytime I want to.

Mongo, I can stop anytime.

What could I do?

It was all around me.

Ah.

We must protect our lab
from traitors and intruders.

One more week, we will
disband, we'll have

All the money we ever need.

Yeah.

Yeah.

CROWD: Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, Ms. Morris,
if you're ready,

I have everything I need to
show you that nice little piece

Of property.

Yes, I'm ready, and
please call me Susan.

So Susan, you said your
husband passed away?

Yes, two years ago.

That's too bad.

I am sorry, but may I
be so forward as to ask

Is the way you're going
to purchase the property?

With insurance money?

Well, yes, some insurance
and some savings.

It's what my
husband and I always

Talked about doing someday,
buying a piece of property

Out away from everything,
away from the rat race,

Then... then he was killed in a
car accident by a drunk driver.

I'm sorry, Susan.

I didn't mean to sound
so, well, what I mean,

I was just trying
to see how we could

Get the best deal for you.

I hope you understand, it really
does help if I know how much

Money a buyer has to work with.

Sure, I understand.

Well, anyway, this
property sounds

Like what you're looking for.

It's been on the
market quite a while

And I think I can get
you an excellent deal.

But, like I said,
it's out in the sticks

And we're in for quite a drive.

It sounds real nice, Cecil,
exactly what I'm looking for.

Now, Susan, don't let the
width of the road frighten you.

The many times I've been on this
road and haven't seen a soul.

And the times I have,
they've all been courteous.

Real nice people
live in this area.

I consider myself
a good driver.

It doesn't bother me.

Oh, jeez.

I don't believe this.

You do have a spare, I hope.

Course I do.

I should have.

Better have.

I do.

Ah.

It's even got air in it.

What do you think?

I don't know.

Ow, damn it.

Cecil, let me help, please, OK?

Oh, fine.

You know, every time one of my
three brothers ran out of gas

Or got a flat tire, they'd
make me go to the gas station

Or change the tire.

They said because I was a
girl, I needed the experience.

Now I know exactly
what they mean.

Huh, you seem to have
the touch, all right.

Thank you.

All right, let's go.

Sure.

Let's go.

Jesus, what the hell was that?

That guys could've killed us.

Now, Susan, relax, please.

Probably just a couple
of kids out having fun.

No big deal.

I don't think so, Cecil.

That looked that truck
I saw back at a ranch

Where we had the flat tire.

I don't know what ranch
you're talking about.

Ah, just some kids.

Well, OK, Cecil, but
I don't like this.

Don't you think we should
turn around and go back?

Now, Susan, you're here to
see a nice piece of property

And that's what I'd
like to do for you.

This could be your dream house.

I think you ought to have the
opportunity to have a look at.

Now, wouldn't you agree?

Those were just a
couple of punk kids,

Nothing to be frightened about.

And besides, I'm here.

They're [inaudible],
you dipshit.

What the hell do they want?

I don't know, but they're
messing with the wrong guy.

Oh, man, this is screwed.

SUSAN: I agree, let's
get the hell out of here.

Oh, shit, we've had it.

Don't say that.

What do you want from us?

They want to kill us,
that's what they want.


Cecil, oh, jeez,
are you all right?

I'm not dead.

I got down, but
I'm... I'm not dead.

Hell of a ride.

Cecil, my legs are
stuck, I can't move.

Look at my car.

I... I can get out.

No, Cecil, wait.

Pull me out of here.

I... I'll get help.

SUSAN: Wait,
please, help me out.

God damn you, Cecil, let
me out of here, help.

No truck again.

I'm getting the
hell out of here.

Trust me, Susan, I'll get help.

Trust me.

Trust me, I will.

No, don't leave me here.

Cecil, please, help me out.

Cecil, God damn you, come back.

Help me out.

I can't believe this
has happened to me.

Cecil, where are you?

What kind of person are you?

Oh, shit.

What the hell is this?

Oh, shit.

There's that son of a bitch.

Cecil?

Cecil?

Cecil, it's Susan.

Cecil, you bastard, how
could you leave me like that?

I could have died
in that damn car.

How do you like my jacket?

I tried to be friends with him,
but I don't think he liked me.

[Door slamming]


I never liked that
stupid jacket anyway.

Ah.

Ah.


Yoo-hoo, is anyone home?

Can the little girl
come out and play?

I'm afraid of the dark.


Come out and play.

Let go of the door
and come out and play.

Is there a light in here?


What have they done to you?

Ah, let go of my
hand, you bitch.

You're hurting me.

Please, you're hurting me.

Please, my hand.

Please.

You bitch, you bitch.

Let me go and... and
I'll be nice to you.

Please, nice little girl, I
can help you get out of here.

Let go of me and get me
out of here, you bitch.

Shit, now what?

I swear I'll be nice to you.

Bitch.

Ah.

Bitch.

Oops.

You get over here and help me.

Going some place?

No, wait a minute, I
don't what the problem is,

But I didn't do anything
to any of you people.

I'll kill you.

Get me out of here.

Don't you leave me here.

And as for you, girl,
there is no more problem.

Not for us, anyway.

You bitch, get over here.

Somebody get Apples.

What do you think Mongo's
going to want us to do with her?

I know what to do with her.

I know what to do too.

What do you think you're doing?

Yeah, what do you
think you're doing?

I'm going to take
care of the problem.

What problem?

She's mine.

She's mine.

She's mine.

I'll kill the bitch.


Mongo, Mongo, I
saved her for you.

I saved her for you.

SUSAN: Hey, you're the son of a
bitch that ran us off the road.

You are in my territory.

You are ruining my
fucking operation.

Tie her up in the barn.

The rest of you,
get back to work.

How can we make any money?

No drugs, no money.

Now, tie her up now.

What's going on here?

Should I dump it?

No, use it.

You should be nice to me.

I can make your short
life a lot easier.

Ow, shit, that hurt.


I'm one bad bitch,
don't fuck with me.

Wow.

Oh, shit.

Terk, get some
people and get her.

Damn it, get her.

What about Star?

What about Star?

You're a dead
fucking shit if you

Don't do exactly what I say.

Now you just lay there you
keep your fucking mouth shut

Or I'll cut your fucking throat.


Get the bitch.

Ha-ha, man, she did you.

She really did you.

What?
What?

Hang on.

Oh, what?


SUSAN: Help me.

Please, help me.

Help me.

I don't know where I'm
at or what I'm doing.

Let's go inside and
we'll call the sheriff.

What are you doing?

What's wrong?

I need your help, please.

I need your help.

Here's your loose end, Mongo.

Take care of it now.

The silly bitch ran to
the wrong ranch for help.

Huh?
Huh?

What?

What did I to you?

You didn't do anything.

You're just a game.

Game's over, Mongo.

Take her back to the
old ranch and kill her.

Kill her?

Shut up, bitch.

You're dead.

You died when you did this.

Yeah, you dead, you
dead, you fucking dead.

Then do it now.

What'd you say?

What did he say?

Mongo, she's a problem for us.

We stand to make lots of money
on these next few shipments.

We should be making drugs,
not chasing this bimbo around.

Bimbo?

The San Francisco
shipment is ready.

All we're waiting for is you.

The super shipment to
LA will be ready when

You get back with the cash.

As far as the girl
is concerned, I'll

Deal with her as I see fit.

And remember, don't forget
to come back with that cash.

OK, Mongo, I just want to make
sure everything is all right.

We all stand to make
some quick money.

And after the LA sale,
we'll disband this operation,

And we'll all live
happily ever after.

Right, Mr. Wilson?

Yeah, right.

The game's not over.

When we get back to our
ranch, tie her up in the barn

And take her shoes.

She gets away again,
she won't get far.

Let's go, move it.

Yeah, the game's not over.

What did he say?

You heard the man, move it.

Let's go, come on.

OK, listen up.

You three, put the shipment
in Mr. Wilson's car.

Come on, let's go.

I'll be one or two
days in San Francisco.

Good.

When you get back with the cash,
the LA shipment will be ready.

Take care of that woman.

She's trouble.

Don't worry.

She's no big deal.

That's what makes me so
good at selling drugs,

Because I worry about detail.

She's no problem.

Me and Mongo are like that.

Tight, man, tight.

I'm the only one he trusts.

So he sent me in here
to check up on you.

Oh, Jesus.

Now you be quiet.

Kiss me.

What?

Kiss me.

Now what's the problem?

Take the tape off.

I can't do that.

And you're getting
me out of the mood.

Take the tape off and I
will do whatever you want.

Shit, I hate that.

You scream and I'll
cut your eyes out.

If I did that, I'd have
a barn full of men beating

Me and slapping me around.

I wouldn't want that.

All I want is you.

Kiss me.

Now what?

What the hell is the problem?

Untie my hands.

I can't do that.

Oh, you think I'm
stupid or something

Or you're fucking with me.

Don't fuck with me.

No, I don't think
you're stupid.

You've got a knife
and my feet are tied

And you're much stronger
than I. All I want is you.

Kiss me.

Untie my hands and I'll really
show you how to make love.

Oh.

Now, see, isn't that better?

Oh, shit.

Kiss me.

I want it all.

She's gone.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Fuck.

Come on.

Get that bitch.

Let's get her.

Terk, take some men and get her.

Bring her back dead or alive.

I'll pay 5,000 alive,
10 if she's dead.

Shit.

Hey, watch out where
you're going, George.

Move your head.

God.

There she is.

Oh, God damn, shit.


What have I got to lose?

Wait, wait.

Wait.

Wait, wait.

Ha-ha, hey, no matter where
I go, women chase after me.


Go get her, Billy.

Go on, go, go, go.

Hey, hey.

Oh, my God, thank you.

Hi, my name is Geno.

SUSAN: Drive, damn it.

They're trying to kill me.

Please, get me the
hell out of here.

Drive, get in the car.

Let's go.

All right, a chick.

OK, OK, Billy, get
your ass in here, dude.

Hey, damsel in distress,
Geno to the rescue.

Get the hell out of here.

Drive.

OK.

OK, come on, let's go.

SUSAN: You don't understand,
they're trying to kill me.

Shut up.

Beer here, dude.

Come on, over here, over here.
Come on, crack me one.

Crack me one.
Here we go.

Dig it.

All right.

Oh-ho-ho, party hard.

What are you doing?

Why are you slowing down?

It's cuz he can't drive worth
a shit while he's been drinking.


Let me out of here.

Just please let me out of here.

Ah, no, no, no.

Oh, look, a sheriff's car.

He'll save us.

Please stop.

Oh, no, no, no, I can't stop.

Get her out of sight.

Sit on her if you have to.

Get her out of sight, man.

Geno's had two DUIs.

He gets one more, he's
looking at a year in the can.

Sorry, lady.

SUSAN: They're after.

They have to be stopped.

All right, we did it.

Hey, hey, we did it.

You dumb fucking cop.

Ha-ha, Geno, you're
just one smooth dude.

Mhm.

A-hoo.

You dumb son of a bitch.

Hey, Geno, you didn't
have to do that.

Shut up.

Just shut up, Billy.

SUSAN: What the
hell are you doing?

You're going to kill us.

Get us back on the main road.

Oh, shut up, lady.


All right, yeah.

It's time.

What does he mean?

Time for what?

Time to dip your
wick in, dumb fuck.


I... I can't do that here.

Oh, come on.

What do you mean you can't?

You get firsties...

Hurry up.

Or I'll take firsties.

We can't do this, man.

We can't.

Oh, what do you mean?

You're nothing
but a wimp, Billy.


Let me out.

Let me out of here.

No, what the hell are you doing?




Is this the shit you've
been talking about?

This is what I've
been trying to tell

You and your dumb fuck friends.

Shit.

Get out of here.

Shit.

Jesus.

Oh, God.

God.

He pulled the ignition wires.

No.


Shit.

Oh, no.

I bet you never listened
to your mothers either.

Why?

Why are you doing this to me?

What the fuck do you want?

Mongo will be here soon.

You ask him.

Oh, jeez, a fucking unicorn.

What did she say?

She said a...

Now your die.

Not so fast, Spike.

Crap.

Hey...

How the hell did she do that?

Hey, hey, hey.

MONGO: Get her.

Get her, God damn it.

What are you waiting for?

Move.

Move.

Go.

Shit.


You stupid son of a
bitch, you almost shot me.

Who are you calling a
stupid son of a bitch,

You asshole, you fucking idiot.

Don't call me an idiot, stupid.

Come on, Terk, we've
got a job to do.

Let's go get her.

Let's go.
Come on.

Go.

Hello?

Hello?

Is anybody there?

Hello?

Shit.

It started, damn it.
It started.

I'm out of here.

You left the keys
in the fucking car.

It's Frankie's fault, pushed me
into the trees, made me forget.

I ought to shoot your ass and
leave you here for the bugs.

Come on, both of
you, shut the fuck up.

Now wait a minute, wait a
minute, it's no big deal.

I got a plan.

I've got to hear
this, you asshole.

We know this road, we know
what direction she's going,

So what are we waiting for?

We cut across that way
and her ass is ours.

Well, then, let's
go, all right?

Come on.

You fucking idiot.

You're the one that fell
first, fucking asshole.

Lost my gun.

Oh...

I'll kill him.

Unless I get my
hands on him first.

Oh, my God.

Shit.

[Tires squealing]

I'm losing my temper, Buck.

I want her real bad.

Let's get her.

This way.

She has to come this way.

Here she comes.

Shoot the tires.

Yeah, sure.


Shoot the fucking tires, huh?

Let's go.

We got her.

We got her in the sheriff's car.

We got her and it
was my idea too.

So where's the car?

That's the problem.

She's driving the car.

She's driving the car?

She's driving the fucking car?

What do you mean?

It's no problem.

She's heading for the canyon.

We can take a shortcut through
there, boom, we got her.

No big deal.

OK, fuck head, but
you better be right.

I'll be back at the ranch.

What in the hell
is she doing, Terk?

How the hell do I know?

Just like a woman,
changing her mind.

Come on.

Told you this was a
stupid idea of yours, Buck,

You fucking idiot.

Who are you calling names?

She's coming back.

She's coming back.
Let's go.

Come on.

Come on.

Go.

Good idea of mine, eh, Terk?



She's in there.

There she is.

We got her.

I told you it would work.

I told you it would work.

It's not her, it's the
sheriff, you dumb bastard.

Yeah, but, Terk...

Shut up, man.

Looks good, Jake.

Open it.

This shows a lack of faith
in your fellow brother.

When it comes to money,
I don't have any brothers.

OK.

Word on the street
is someone's been

Selling some bad shit, man.

Couple of kids died.

This makes me look bad.

Makes you look bad, huh?

Cut 'em off, then
you raise the price.

They just OD'ed man.

What the fuck?

You lost a couple
of kids, big deal.

Keep 'em.

They ain't mine.

Get that shit out of there.

White motherfucker stole
that car, fucking thief.





Aye, Mongo.

Mongo, come here,
man, look at this.

Buck, come here, man.

Get over here.

Nice if you to drop by.

Saved us a lot of time.

Nice outfit.

You can push me, but you
can only push me so far.

Now, it's my turn.



Whoa.

Ach-yeah, ch-yeah, whoa,
karate, black belt, 15 years.

Ballet, six months.

Ow.

Get her.

Get that bitch...

Ah.

You have disgraced me.

Now, let's fight to the death.

Argh.

Ow.

What the fuck was that?

What?

Huh?

What?

Get her.

Oh, shit.

Go, go, go.

Come on, get the bitch, man.

Get her, get her.

Forget her, man.

Let's split.

Dump this whole operation, man.

We've got enough money.

No way, she's going to die.

Listen to me.

She's going to die, Terk.

Listen to me,
she's going to die.

Do you understand?

She's going to die.

Ah.

Hey, assholes.

Ah.

That bitch, that
fucking bitch is dead.

Oh, damn, man, she's pissed.

Damn, she's mad.

She's going to do us all.

I told you, Apples.

Shut up, Georgie.

Both of you shut the fuck up.

She's just one woman.

How can she do this to us?

Because she's pissed, man.

That's how she's going
to do that to us.

Shut the fuck up,
I'll clean it myself.

Oh, she's pissed, man.

She's going to do us all.

Let's get the bitch
before she gets us.

That's the way that
game is played.

Let's go.

Yeah, watch your feet though,
she's had ballet lessons.

GEORGIE: She's going
to do us all, man.

You're mine now.

Easy 10 grand.

Why share three ways?

I'm gonna cut her ear off.

I'm going to cut
the bitch's ear off.

No, not yet.

We're going to take
her back to the ranch

And hang her right in the
middle of the courtyard.

I'm going to cut
her ear off first.

I don't give a
fuck what you say.

You see this?

She's going to pay.

She's going to pay for this.

Back at the ranch,
she can pay for that.

Georgia, listen to me.

If we cut her ear
off now, she's going

To get sick, throw
up, and pass out,

And we'll have to carry or.

Do you want to carry
her back to the ranch?

Fuck no, you don't.

Get that rope.

Heh, I don't know
what the big deal was

Because she ain't that tough.

What?

What did you say?

I don't know what
the big deal was.

She ain't that tough.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What the...

It's a trick.
It's a trick.

She's going to do something.

Bitch will trick you.

Ah.

I knew it.
I knew it.

I knew it.

She hurt me.

Damn it, I knew something
like this was going to happen.

I knew it, I knew it.

Well, well, little lady.

Do you know what time it is?

It's time to die.

I wouldn't come any
closer if I were you.

Why?

Are you going to
scratch out my eyes?

Heh-heh-heh.

No.

This place is booby trapped
and you're going to die.

She's going to do us.

She's going to do us all, man.

You're lying.

It's time for you to die, lady.

Say your last words.

You squat when you pee?

Ah.

I knew something like
this was going to happen.

Apples, man, you OK?

Shit, man.

We're supposed to
be the bad guys.

Oh, shit, I ain't
doing too good.

Not too good at all.

Bitch.

OK, Terk, you're right.

We'll get back to the
ranch and pack up.

Yeah, I had enough
of this crap.

Get Mr. Wilson to split the
money and we're out of here.

That crazy broad did
one good thing for us.

There's less people we have
to share the money with.

Yeah, the less survivors,
the more money we get.

That's the way
the game's played.

Yeah, we in, they lose.

Terk, go to the way up and
pack up the rest of the drugs

That are ready for sale.

Yeah, we don't want to
cut us short of any money.

I'll go to the house, pick
up the rest of the cash.

I hope Mr. Wilson
will be here soon

With the rest of the money.

Let's do it.

Let's go.

What's going on here?

Where's everybody at?

They're dead, man.

She killed them all
except for me and Mongo.

You're stupid, man.

You're all fucked
up, all of you.

I told you to get
rid of that bitch.

I did my job.

I got the cash.

Now you do yours.

It's too late, man.

It's not too late.

I need my share of the LA sale.

Get rid of that bitch now.

I said forget it,
man, it's too late.

No, get rid of
her now, damn you.

How about I get
rid of you, asshole?

I'm back.

So what?

Ah.

You bitch.

Ah.


Ah.

Ah.

No.

Yes.

Yes, woo.
