What are you doing out here?

I'm lost.
This is a restricted area.

Oh, I didn't know that. There's no signs.

They're everywhere.

Let's see some ID.

Why?

If you broke the gate back there
your trespassing.

Excuse me sir.

That gate was open and I was under
the opinion this is a detour.

Let me see your ID. Take it out.

What kind of uniform is that?

I'll ask the fucking questions!

It's a private outfit, huh.

I tried to get one of those jobs. I
like guarding things.

Really.

Here you go, sir.

I think what must have happened is I
got turned around there.

I guesstimate that I have about 50 lbs of
copper wire...

100 lbs of chain link fence...

and 2 manhole covers, the nice thick ones.

I'll give you 50 cents a pound for the wire,
15 for the fence and 10 for the covers.

That's below market value.

Market value?

You've got a cop that came by asking
about manhole covers?

I'd like to counter...

$1.00 per pound for the copper,
$0.30 for the fence...

and 20 cents for the covers.

Sell them somewhere else.

I'd feel good at 75, 25 and 15.

I'm not negotiating with you.

I think we're close.
I'm done!

I'm willing to take less to establish
a business relationship.

If that's your last best offer, then
I guess I accept.

Alright, drive around back and
unload them.

Excuse me, sir.

I'm looking for a job.

In fact, I made up my mind to find
a career...

that I can learn and grow into.

Who am I? I'm a hard worker.

I set high goals and I'm told that
I'm persistent.

Now I'm not fooling myself, sir.

Having been raised with the self esteem
movement so popular in schools...

I used to expect my needs to be considered.

But I know that today's work culture
no longer caters to the job loyalty...

that could be promised to earlier generations.

What I believe sir...

is that good things come to those
who work their assess off.

And that people such as yourself who
reached the top of the mountain...

didn't just fall there.

My motto is: If you want to win
the lottery...

you have to make the money to buy a ticket.

Did I say that I worked in a garage?

So what do you say? I could start
tomorrow or...

even why not tonight.

No!

How about an internship then?

A lot of young people are taking unpaid
positions to get a foot in the door.

That's something I'd be willing to do.

I'm not hiring a fucking thief.

[Joe Loder] Let's go.

We're first.
No shit.

Get a shot on the other side.
Alright, alright.

Get a shot inside the car.

Go around get inside the car. What the
fuck am I paying you for!

Get back, Loder.

Get back!
I'm back, I'm back.

Excuse me.

Will this be on television?

Morning news. If it bleeds, it leads.

What channel?

Whoever pays the most.

What do you get for something like this?

Not nearly enough.

But enough to buy all that gear.

Let me tell you something.

It's a flaming asshole of a job.

Can I ask you are you currently hiring?

Fuck no.

Well...

Thank you for taking the time to
discuss what you do.

You've been very helpful.

designed for competitive road cycling.

This bike has a lightweight space-age

positioned to put the rider in a more
aerodynamic posture.

It also has micro-shifters and 37 gears
and weighs under 6 pounds.

I won the Tour De Mexico on this bike.

It cost me over 8,000 new.

700.
2500 and that's giving it away.

No bike has 37 gears.

$ 2,000.

No.

Can I speak to your boss, please.

I'm the owner.

How about 800 and a store credit.

What are you after?

A camcorder and a police scanner.

I had a great fucking angle back there
till you trotted out.

Get the fuck home. There's people trying to
do their fucking job.

Fucking asshole!

Yes, it's Ace Video. Your leads
gonna be at 1st and Western.

Tell you when I get there.

It's a shooting.

Yeah I got some great footage of a
victim being treated.

No the LAPD hasn't released it but the
manager of the Walgreenâ€™s...

said that it was a carjacking
and the victim was the owner.

He's Asian and critical.

Right.

Look I got a 60 second cut with the
manager and a neighborhood.

$500.

Well then make me a deal, $400.

$300. Alright, deal.

Are you fucking kidding me?!

Get outta here.

Let's open with the shooting in Downey.

She wants a stand in with the story.
Okay, do what you have to.

I don't think that's gonna cover it.
Hey it's not my call.

Oh, excuse me.

Excuse me, I have video footage.
Down the hall to the right.

Put the neighbor here and the kids with
their mother by the door.

And date it back from 2:16.
Okay.

Then I want to run in some sound. Let's
leave the neighbors dog barking.

And try taking the crying kid from B roll
and drop that in the background.

Okay.

Are you my film operator.
I don't think so.

I'm Lou Bloom. I have some
footage for sale.

A stringer?

What?
Who do you work for?

At the moment, I work for myself.

See Frank out there the
way you came.

What's it timed to?
01:06

What do you have?

Something I'm fairly certain you'll
be excited about.

What is it?

It's a shooting.

A man was shot, several times in fact...

he was laying on the ground, he was
bleeding on the ground.

I'd be surprised if he survived, honestly.

He was shot during a carjacking.

Western and 1st?

Yes, that's right.
Okay well we're getting that from this.

I was there. I was much closer to
what happened.

Okay, okay. Let's see it.

Fast forward through this.

Keep going, keep going.

<i>Walk away or I'll arrest you for a ...</i>

Get out of here!
A minute and a half in.

Ah, there.

I got no pulse.
Oh fuck!

I need you to see something.

Yeah.

Lou Bloom, Frank Kruse our assignment editor.

Play it back.

<i>- I got no pulse.
He's unresponsive.</i>

And that's the lead.

I want to break it up and do a wrap
around from the scene.

I want a walking stand up, a teaser
at 5, a repeat on the half...

and I want the copy to start with a warning.

You're gonna show this?!

With a warning.
It's excessive.

We should have packages like this every day.

People are eating breakfast.

And they'll talk about it at work.

Tie it in with the carjacking last
month in Glendale...

and the other one, the van, in Palms.
When was that, in March?

Yeah March.
It's a carjacking crime wave.

That's the banner.

Call the victims family, go to court,
you know what to do.

Yeah.

How much?

I'm selling this particular piece
for $1,000.

Not even close. This late you have
nowhere else to go.

And the quality is for shit.

I'll give you 250 that's the
most I'll give.

Now let's get you paid.

Here you go.

Buy yourself some better equipment.

A directional mic and get
interviews when you can.

You have a good eye.
Thank you.

I'm just beginning, so praise from someone
such as yourself...

as you can imagine that means quite a lot.

Well I'll help in any way I can.

And of course you can help me by
calling us first.

I want you to contact me when you
have something.

Something like this.
That's right.

Bloody.

Well that's only part of it. We like
crime, but not all crime.

Carjacking in Compton, for example.
That isn't news now is it.

Nina.

We find our viewers are more interested
in urban crime...

creeping into the suburbs.

What that means is a victim...

or victims, preferably well off, white.

Injured at the hands of the poor, or
a minority.

Just crimes?

No, accidents play. Cars, buses,
trains, planes, fire...

But bloody.

Well, graphic.

The best and clearest way that I can
phrase it to you Lou...

that captures the spirit of what we are...

is think of our news cast as a
screaming woman...

running down the street with her throat cut.

I understand.

I'm a very, very quick learner. You'll
be seeing me again.

I believe you.

Live from the KWLA broadcast
center in Los Angeles.

This is KWLA 6 News at 6am.

Coverage you can count on.

A tragic drug store visit to help
his ailing wife...

claimed the life of a loving husband last
night near Hancock Park.

Reporting from the scene is Ron De La Cruz.

An act of kindness turned into
a savage, deadly attack...

just outside this market on Western and 1st
around 2am.

Where 68 year old Richard Cho of Mar Vista
was walking towards his car...

with a prescription for his sick wife...

when he was confronted right here by a man
with a 9mm handgun...

who police believe wanted to take
his vehicle.

The vicious tragedy and senselessness
of the brutal shooting...

as well as the victims final moments,
were all caught in graphic video...

which we are about to show.

Viewer discretion is advised.

Paramedics worked feverishly to
save the life of Richard Cho...

but despite heroic efforts, the husband
and father of three...

was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital.

Alarmingly, this is the third
violent carjacking...

in the area in recent months.

And residents here are growing concerned...

as police are still without any leads.

This is Ron De La Cruz, reporting live.

Rick.

I'm Louis Bloom.
Oh, hey Lou.

Louis.

Sit down.

The situation is that I lost an employee
and I'm interviewing for a replacement.

The ad didn't say what the job was?

It's a fine opportunity for some
lucky someone.

Okay.

I'd like to know about your prior employment
and hear it in your own words...

what you learned from this position

My old jobs?

I did landscaping for a couple months...

Mold blue and gold??

I learned that I had hay fever, so I quit.

Other jobs?

Like a week here a week there.

Why hire you?

Sell yourself.

Ok.
Go.

I'm Rick, of course..

I took three buses to get here, I
finished high school, I need a job...

I'd do pretty much anything if
you hire me.

What's your address, Richard?

I don't have one right now.

You're homeless.
I was for a while.

You trick.

What the street, no.
Wasn't a question.

I'm straight.
How many straight guys trick?

Do you have a drivers license?
Yeah.

You know Los Angeles?

Yeah I grew up all around here.
Can you start tonight?

Doing what?

I run a successful TV news business.

We film breaking stories.

Maybe you saw my item this morning,
the fatal carjacking.

No, I don't have a TV, but that's cool.

Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah.

Does it have GPS?
Yes, it does.

Congratulations, you're hired.

Okay.

Your job will be to listen to emergency
radio, learn police codes...

help navigate and watch the car.

Okay.

And what does it pay?
It's an internship.

Man, I uh...

I can't do that, I need money.

I'm giving you a chance to explore
career options...

and gain insight into my organization.

It's not at all unusual for me to make
full time job offers to my interns.

I just...

I gotta get paid, I need something
at least, you know?

I'll give you $30 cash per night.

OK.

Okay.

Yes.

Next left coming up.

I need more warning next time.

Where are we going? Talk to me,
what's  next?

Keeping on this 5 or 6 blocks
and then a right.

On what?!

I made a mistake, it was a right
five blocks back.

It's just 5 blocks.

Did they bring them out?
They just left 2 minutes ago.

You're a lifetime too late. Nice camera.

I bet I wasted $5 in gas just getting here...

or don't you think that's a lot of money?!

I'm sorry. I couldn't see the street you
were driving so fast.

First of all, Richard...

Don't answer me by telling me a problem.

I have enough of those already. Bring me a
solution and then we can make a decision together.

Okay, maybe if you didn't rush me.

Don't rush you. Okay, I can use that.

You see Rick, they've done studies...

and they found that any system that
relies on cooperation...

What?

You're going really fucking fast, man.

Get out of your head Rick, it's
a bad neighborhood.

And when you get a chance, I'd like to
know where we're going.

Left on 3rd in six blocks.

Find a more appropriate place to park the
car and don't get blocked in.

Sir, what's going on?

Who the fuck are you?

TV news, what happened?

It was a shooting.

I told the cops that he was waving
a gun last week...

but they didn't fucking care.

Can you try one more time without swearing.

I'm not doing it again.
But this is for TV.

Yeah? I don't have a TV.

It's over.

Shot to shit.

<i>[Nina] Great shot.</i>

Oh that's fantastic.

Oh that's a great piece of tape.

You couldn't get an interview with the couple?
I have footage of them.

I had an interview with the neighbor,
but she curses.

We can cut that out.

How did you get inside the house?

The door was open.
They allowed you?!

I heard somebody yell to come in and
nobody was inside, I left.

The only shot of the couple is
through a window?

The police were shutting it down.

I don't like it.
Like what?

The footage looks like he broke in.

There's no closeup of the homeowners...

and he's giving us their name off a piece
of private correspondence.

Excuse me, that's junk mail.
Well I have a problem with that.

We'll knock out a killer package.
This is my job.

No!

Your job is writing the tweet of the day.

And getting Deb to turn sideways during
the weather forecast.

We're running it!

I like how you handled Frank. You didn't
soften the truth or dilute it.

I think being clear with your objectives is more
important than...

trying to present your ideas in a
non-confrontational manner.

Do you have experience in an office?

Nice ?? I'll have you know.

Where did you get all that?
I study a lot online.

Oh, yeah? Like what?
All sorts of things, actually.

I'm on my computer all day.

I haven't had what you'd call much of
a formal education...

but can find almost anything if
you look hard enough.

Last year...

I took an online business course
for example.

And I learned...

that you have to have a business plan
before starting a business.

And why you pursue something...

is equally as important as what you pursue.

The site advised you to...

answer the following question before you
decide where to focus your abilities.

The question was...

"What do I like to do?"

The site suggested making a list
of your strengths and weaknesses.

"What am I good at? What am I not good at?"

Maybe I want to strengthen and develop
knowledge about the things I'm good at...

maybe I want to strengthen my weaknesses.

I recently remade my list.

And I'm thinking...

that television news...

might just be something I love...

as well as something I happen to be good at.

On TV it looks so real.

Yes, it does.

Well I have a show to do.

Your checks at the desk.

Outstanding work, Lou.
Thanks, Nina. That means an awful lot.

It's every parents nightmare. Imagine singing
a lullaby to your infant and tucking them into bed...

and then having to shield them as a barrage
of high caliber bullets...

literally blasts into your home.

For the Cahills of Echo Park, that fear
became a terrifying reality...

when an adjacent house became the setting
for a scene right out of the wild west.

Rick, I'm very pleased with how
you've progressed.

You're doing a great job.

However, you just spilled gasoline on
my car which will eat the paint.

I need you to tighten up a bit on this.

Because if you spill it like that again I will
terminate you immediately, I promise you.

Bed, Bath & Beyond.

That's a good store.

Making peace with what you don't have
is what it's all about.

Living will attain that, right?

Don't you think?

TV news, what happened?

I think it was a head on collision. There's
a guy who's dead over there. There's a woman...

Did you see what happened?
Am I supposed to help move...

I didn't see it. I came after...

Can you tell me exactly what happened.
Will you get the camera out of my face!

Get it out! I'm trying to talk to 911!

No, the guys down.

Already through here.

Son of a bitch.

Oh, fuck this!

Here you go.

Ben Waterman wears the same
gold tie on Fridays.

We're leading with it. That's your 3rd
start this week.

I'm focusing on framing.

A proper frame not only draws the eye
into a picture but...

keeps it there longer.

dissolving the barrier between the
subject and the outside of the frame.

Is that blood on your shirt?

I don't think so.

I recently heard of a Mexican restaurant
called Cabanita.

Have you heard of it?
It's also on your sleeve.

I didn't see that.

What I'm asking is do you like
Mexican food, Nina?

Yes.

Cabanita has been called an authentic
taste of Mexico City.

Do you want to go with me? I think
we could have fun together.

Thanks but I'm busy.

Saturday is your night off, isn't it?
I have a rule, Lou I...

I don't date people I work with.

And I'm twice your age.

I like older women.

Besides I don't work with you. You're
someone I sell to.

And I don't want to fuck that up.

What if by saying no you fuck it up?

Is that what you're saying?

I didn't say that.

Well I don't know what to say.

<i>Good morning and thank you for joining us,
I'm Lisa Mays.</i>

<i>I am the Ben Waterman. First up this
morning on KWLA News...</i>

<i>A horrible car crash over on Benedict Canyon
it's claimed the life now of one man...</i>

<i>and severely injured a young woman.</i>

Hey, Lou.

Hey man, Joe Loder, Mayhem.

Really good tonight.

They closed it down by the time we
showed up.

You were waiting for me out here?

No I was driving by, I saw your car.

You're not dropping your shit off
are you? Nobody does that.

You need an Air Card if you want to be
in the game.

Import the video to your laptop,
cut the video...

upload to the FTP site and notify the
stations you have something for sale.

Boom, boom, boom.

Otherwise, it's a nice ride.

Listen man, you've got a good run going,
but there's valleys out there.

Take it from me. I've been night crawling
14 years.

You heard I'm adding a second van?

No, I didn't know that.
That'll be a game changer.

Cut my on scene time in half...

I'm setting up a dedicated dispatch too.

No more listening and driving. That's
for suckers.

Do you like the Canon 305?

I never used one.
$6,000 a piece.

2.4 megapixels, night vision and 18:1 zoom.

I've got one of those puppies with
your name on it.

I have a camera.

I want you running my second van.

Two crews, half the area to cover.

I know what you're thinking.
Half the money, right?

You should be thinking twice the sales.

Cause we're gonna be the first to every scene.

Why compete when we can work together?

I'll share my press cards, puppy dog off
my police connections.

This is the big move, the next level.

We'd corner this whole thing.

I'm talking about putting some heavy digits
in our pocket, bra.

Thank you for offering me the position,
but working for myself...

is more in line with my skills and career goals.

Take a few days to think about it.

No!

You need to hire someone else and I
don't want to hold up the process.

You want to be on the inside of this cause I'm
gonna be tag teaming every call.

You keep talking like...

it's something that I may be interested in,
but I'm not.

You don't even understand the offer.

If you did you'd be fucking sucking
my dick!

You're asking me questions. What does this
mean. What does that mean.

I feel like...

grabbing you by your ears right now...

and screaming in your face...

"I'm not fucking interested."

Instead, I'm gonna drive home and do
some accounting.

Fuck you.

Twerp.

Didn't wake up til 5.

My body's so off I feel like it's time for...

breakfast.

I bet you're beautiful every time of the day.

In fact...

I'd say you're much prettier than Lisa Mays.

I like the dark makeup on your eyes.
I also like the way you smell.

So where you from, Lou?

The north end of the valley.

Some of the calls sometimes take
me over there...

but nobody I know still lives out there.

You're from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

How'd you know that?

It's online.

Everything about you's online. Not everything,
but definitely a lot.

I've watched all videos from when you were a
reporter. I'm sure you've looked at those of course.

No, god no. Not without a drink
in my hand.

I watch my work all the time.

You want to become a reporter?
No.

Most of you guys want airtime.

Not me.

I want to be the guy that owns the
station that owns the camera.

The business is going well, but...

In order to grow to the next level...

I need to stay one step ahead of my
competition and take risks.

I also need financial support to
implement expansion.

Would you like another margarita?

One is enough.

Thank you for coming out to talk.

The place I'm in now, is that I...

want a relationship with someone I
can team up with...

And share, the same job and hours
and what not.

I could do another laundry list, but
you get the idea.

Yes.

Well I hope you find someone.

Here's the thing about that, Nina.

I'm quite certain I already have.

Okay.

Let me put this politely.

I only came out to dinner with you Lou,
purely as a professional courtesy.

Thank you.

I don't think it's any secret that I've
single handedly raised the unit price...

for your ratings book.

Uh...

ratings book price?! Whoa.

I'm a very fast learner.

We had a conversation where I specifically
mentioned that. Do you remember that?

Well do you?
Yes.

I recently learned for instance that...

most Americans watch local news
to stay informed.

I also learned that the average half hour
of LA television news...

packs all of it's local government
coverage...

including law enforcement, budget,
transportation, education and immigration...

into 22 seconds.

Local crime stories however not only usually
lead the news,

but filled 14 times the broadcast adding
in 5 minutes and 7 seconds.

KWLA relies heavily on such stories.

With Los Angeles crime rates going down...

I think that makes items like mine
particularly valuable.

Like rare animals.

I can only imagine that your needs will
increase during next months ratings period.

Whoo! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Yeah, well we certainly appreciate
what you do.

There are certain good things about
being alone.

You have time to do the things you want
to do, like study and plan, but...

you can't have dinners like this or be
physical with a person...

I mean that's not a flirtation-ship.

Where are you going with this?

I want that.

With you.

Like you want to keep your job
and your health insurance.

Look.

Just for starters, I don't need you to
keep my fucking job!

You're the news director, on the
Rampart shift...

at the lowest rated station in Los Angeles.

We have what could be considered an
almost exclusive relationship...

there are many other places I could go.

I have to think that you are invested in
this transaction.


Enjoy.
Thank you.

Where did you get the balls to even
suggest something like this?

We're still talking.
No!

There's nothing more to say.
You can leave.

Well okay, look, you've done well.

Okay? And we pay you well, very well.

We always have.

If you like, I can get you an exclusive retainer.

That would be on top of your segment fees.

I could maybe even get you a job at the station
starting as a production assistant...

so that you could learn the business from
the inside.

That's where you said your interests lie.

Uh huh.

You're not listening, Nina.

I happen to know that you haven't stayed at
one station for longer than 2 years at a time...

and you're coming up on 2 years soon.

I can imagine that your contract is
for that length of time...

and next months ratings directly
affect that.

So you're threatening that if I don't...

I'm negotiating.
You're threatening to stop selling to me.

That's your choice.

The true price of any item is what
somebody's is willing to pay for it.

You want something...

and I want you.

To fuck you.

And as a friend.

Jesus Christ. Friends don't pressure friends
to fucking sleep with them.

Oh see, that's not true, Nina.

For then I'm sure you know...

a friend...

is your gift to give yourself.

Okay left on Roth and then 6 blocks to
the ramp.

You're putting me on the 5?!

Yeah, to the 5 then the 110 to the 10.

Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?

Did I read it?

Yeah I read it.
What did it say?

About the 5.

I looked at it okay, why?

Well for one thing it included that the 5 has
construction in the fast lane the next few weeks...

so given that I expect you to put me onto
the 2 to the 101 to the 110 to the 10.

That's half of one, six of the other.
It's "Half dozen of one, six of the other".

What I'd like you to do is admit that you
didn't read what you said you did.

You know I'm a reasonable person,
but no one likes to be lied to.

Okay, then when am I gonna get my raise?!
That's reasonable right?

You keep talking about this performance
review. When's it gonna happen?

Been out here 2 months already busting
my ass every night.

I'm tired of your promises for more pay...

and I'm sleeping in a garage.
Rick!

Trying to leverage your salary in this
economic environment is near impossible.

Most firms have set starting wages. Ideally
you could leverage with other offers...

but that's just not the case in
this situation right now.

<i>[Scanner] North division, battalion 12</i>

Can you route us to that.

We're like 22 minutes from the Foothill
and only 5 from the 1.

They're rolling heavy rescue and
an air ambulance.

Get me there, please.

You're not getting through here.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all over there
buddy. Turn it around. Let's go.

You're late.


Five fatals. Came screaming out of
the fucking sky.

All lit up with the brush on fire. Mine.

Exclusive. I'm banging.

And my other vans in Carson getting
a jumper.

You know...

I was trying to hook you up, man.

Trying to teach you something.

Welcome to the future, bra.

A car crash.

None of this is gonna knock anybody out.

I can't use any of this in my rundown.

Is this it?

No, I have that stabbing in Corona.
Where's the plane crash at Foothill?

I don't mind saying that I'm trying to bring
you stories that happened here on the ground.

2 has it. It'll be their lead.

Well I hope that works well for them.

Now, let me show you
the stabbing in Corona.

I don't give a god damn about
fucking Corona!

You know how important this week is.
This shit is fucking death to me.

I understand your frustration. I was just
trying not to be too hard on myself.

I sold you upstairs as some kind of
fucking sweeps savior.

And I'm leading with a goddamn stabbing.

In Corona.

So you want that then?
I want you to get in the goddamn game!

I want something that people
can't turn away from.

I want what you fucking promised me!

<i>Good morning and thanks for joining us.
I'm Pat Harvey.</i>

about to see is graphic...</i>

<i>and viewer discretion is advised.</i>

Since when did Coldwater become
faster than Laurel?

What was the thinking there?

I didn't ask that to hear myself speak.
Because you know Coldwater only has six lights.

But Laurel has places to pass. I can't
get around this person until Ventura.

It's a silly argument, man.

I said this route, you wanted to take
Laurel, you should've said something.

I thought that you worked in other factors.

If I didn't think that you could do better,
I wouldn't ride you so hard about the routes.

I think you know that, Rick.

I think I have a higher opinion of you
than you have of yourself.

Goddamn it!

Son of a bitch!

This is to a van traced to Moorpark?
Who cares. What's the rush?

Why aren't we at the rape at Griffith Park
like everybody else?!

Oh, fuck...

Oh fuck me, oh god, that's the fucking
Mayhem van.

Joe Loder and the other dude.
What's his name? Fucking Marcus.

Park the car and get your camera.

<i>We've got one guy inside.</i>

<i>Can't get that in right there?</i>

What the hell happened?

According to witnesses, they were driving
at high rate of speed...

probably toward Griffith Park...

when apparently they ran head on into
this light pole and another car.

How do they just run into a pole?

Hey don't film that man, he's one of us.

Not anymore, Rick. We're professionals.

And he's just sales.

Man we were way the hell out here.

We beat the police.

What do you want me to do?
You know what to do, Rick.

What is going on?

We're leaving.
What? What's in there?

What's going on?

What happened in there?

You should have walked with me.
You're curious.

That's what I pay you to do. You
just show initiative.

There is no better way to achieve
job security...

than by making yourself an
indispensable employee.

I heard gun shots!
All the more reason you might have helped me.

You might have learned a new skill that
made you more useful...

and put us on a track toward growth.

Stay in the car.
Why?

Because I said so.

I've been trying to reach you for
the last hour.

In the future when you don't have
anything...

man up and don't dodge my fucking call!

I do have something.

What?

Home invasion, triple murder
in Granada Hills.

That's just breaking now.
We got there before the police.

You have it?

I'm not gonna list the many benefits
of this piece...

it's probably best if you just watch it
for yourself.

We could have had someone out there
by now. Why didn't you call?

To increase the need and prove my
value in person.

Frank, Jenny, bay 2 now!

Get Linda in here.

Home invasion in Granada.

He got there before the cops with 10
minutes jail time.

How much of this can we show?

You man legally?

No morally.  Of course legally.

Have they been identified?

It just happened so you have to assume no
and that's just one of the issues.

You can't broadcast their identities
without notifying the next of kin.

We're not identifying them.
You are by proxy by showing their faces.

We pixelate the faces.

Where did you get this?
A stringer.

Hi Linda, I'm Lou.

Oh Jesus, is that a dead baby
inside of there?

No, the crib was empty.

Well for Christ's sake, are we breaking
the law by showing this?

Dot the faces, don't give out the exact
address. Do that...

I guess, I do not know...

I wouldn't think so, no.

Journalistically and ethically...
This isn't Hartford.

We are beyond all broadcast standards.

Have you seen the overnights?

I'll risk the fine.

What did you pay for this?
The price hasn't be negotiated yet.

Give us a moment.

Thanks.

How much?
$100,000.

How much?
$ 50,000.

I need a number. In 9 minutes
I need a number.

I just gave you 2.

$ 3,000.

You paid $3,000 for the food truck
stabbings.

There were more dead.

Those were poor Mexican people in
a roach coach.

2 of them were illegals.

These are 3 wealthy white people, shot
and killed in their mansion.

Including a suburban housewife shotgunned
in her bed.

I know you, Nina.

I know your interest and excitement is
greater than the amount you're offering.

$ 5,000.
$ 30,000.

$ 7,000.
$ 25,000.

$ 8,000.
$ 15,000.

$ 9,000.
$ 15,000.

$ 10,000.
$ 15,000.

Give me a serious number.
$ 15,000.

Can't do it, never happen, it's a matter
of price. 10 is my last best offer.

Okay.

Really?

Where are you going?

7 has approached me at least several
times.

Dan Vito gave me his number.

They'll make me a better offer. It's
a 5 minute drive.

Hold on!

12.

15.

I can't spend a months budget on a single story.

What if the story's not over?

The people who did this escaped.

They're still out there. Walking around
with the rest of us.

If I had a family and I lived in a home,
that might make me nervous.

I'd want updates on what was going on.

With this footage, people would turn to
your channel for the story.

Now I like you, Nina.

And I look forward to our time together.

But you have to understand $15,000...

isn't all that I want.

From here on, starting now...

I want my work to be credited by the
editors on a burn.

The name of my company is
Video Production News...

a professional news gathering service.

That's how it should be read and that's
how it should be said.

I also want to go to the next rung, and
meet your team.

And the station manager and
the Director and the anchors.

And start developing my own personal
relationships.

I'd like to start meeting them this morning.

You'll take me around and introduce me as the
owner and president of...

Video Production News.

And remind them of some of my many
other stories.

I'm not done.

I also want to stop our discussion
over prices.

This will save time.

So when I say a number is my lowest price,
that's my lowest price.

And you can be assured that I arrived at
whatever that number is very carefully.

Now when I say...

that I want these things...

I mean that I want them. And I don't
want to have to ask again.

And the last thing that I want, Nina...

is for you to do the things that I ask you
to do when we're alone in your apartment.

Not like the last time!

So...

I'll tell you what.

I have the van crash on Moorpark tonight...

with a couple of stringers actually.

That could lead by itself on an
average night.

I'd be willing to throw that in for free.

What do you say, do we have a deal?

Lisa Mays, Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

Hi, pleasure to meet you.
Hello, how are you, Lisa?

You remember Lou from the
Benedict Canyon crash.

Oh yeah, great stuff.
Good stuff.

That was my company, Video Production News.

I would just like to say, that I think that
what the 2 of you do...

is incredibly valuable.

Thank you. That's very kind.
Very kind of you.

We appreciate it.

I do not know how long this tape runs
in like that.

20 seconds to back. Ben and Lisa
20 seconds to back.

Set the standard #22 jump.

Where is the banner?

Did you decide on one?
Horror House.

What do you talk about?
Hold on.

Put it on CZ1.
Back in ten seconds.

Nine...

Eight, seven, six...

Five, four, three...

Two, one...

spin it.

Lights, dissolve, cue.

<i>Hello everybody, this is KWLA with
breaking news...</i>

<i>Over the last half hour or so...</i>

<i>we've now received word of a home
invasion triple homicide.</i>

In the Granada Hills area of the
San Fernando Valley.

Now at present, the number of those dead...

<i>- has not been confirmed yet by police...</i>
Prep camera 2.

<i>but KWLA has obtained exclusive footage
from inside the crime scene...</i>

<i>in which at least three bodies can
be observed.</i>

<i>Now we're going to show you segments
of that footage...</i>

<i>throughout the rest of this broadcast
of course...</i>

<i>but also throughout the day...</i>

Now Lisa, have the tape. When you're ready
let's go to it. I'll follow you.

<i>Again, we're about to show you exclusive
KWLA video from inside the crime scene.</i>

It's graphic, repeat it!
<i>- Before broadcasting this video...</i>

<i>we want to warn our viewers that these
are extremely graphic images.</i>

<i>and I'm hearing from my control room
that we have that video.</i>

<i>- and they're gonna show it now.
Let's roll it now.</i>

<i>This is footage that was obtained
exclusively by KWLA...</i>

<i>from Video Production News</i>

<i>this is a professional news gathering
service.</i>

<i>And this is what appears to be a shotgun.</i>

<i>something you might use for home defense...</i>

<i>We can see the pistol grips on the front and
back. Quite possibly the murder weapon.</i>

<i>Now, Lisa, as we move inside, this is
a beautiful home.</i>

<i>A beautiful home in a very safe neighborhood.</i>

<i>or what most people think is a safe
neighborhood. It appears...</i>

<i>- that is the first body.
There's the body.</i>

<i>A young woman, I'm guessing from this
angle, on a sofa.</i>

<i>All of the faces have been blurred out.</i>

They escaped, they're on the loose.

<i>That is the first of what we understand are 3
bodies in the home in Granada Hills...</i>

<i>and this was committed by a suspect or
suspects...</i>

<i>who are still out there. They are
believed to have escaped.</i>

<i>and if you think about that, that is a
very frightening thought.</i>

Repeat that!

<i>Yes scary and very concerning, particularly
given what we're looking at.</i>

<i>The savagery of what these pictures show.
There on the floor Lisa, I'm guessing what is that...</i>

<i>- A bloodied article of clothing.
Seems like a silk shirt.</i>

<i>- Maybe a woman's silk blouse.
It's so sad. Now as we move...</i>

<i>- to one of the bedrooms.</i>
Dissolve to camera 2.

There obviously is the second body.

<i>- The person or the people...</i>
They escaped. Repeat it!

<i>who committed all of this brutal
home invasion robbery...</i>

<i>they're presently unidentified and at
large. Still on the streets there.</i>

Hit it again, harder!

<i>has got to be a huge worry, not only to the
residents in this neighborhood, Granada Hills...</i>

<i>- All of Los Angeles if you think about it.
The entire Southland tonight, absolutely.</i>

<i>An apparent family...</i>

<i>savagely killed, we believe this is
their own home.</i>

<i>in what is one of the quieter...</i>

<i>frankly more upscale and
affluent neighborhoods.</i>

<i>- In the whole valley.
In all of Los Angeles.</i>

<i>And now as we're moving, this is
a nursery.</i>

<i>- And you hope to god that thereâ€™s not a...</i>
Build it!

<i>a baby in that crib.</i>

<i>We're just praying that that crib is empty,
cause this is definitely a child's room.</i>

<i>And now as you look, thank goodness...</i>

<i>- In fact our understanding is that
there was no baby found...</i>

<i>in the house or any baby that was
seen at all...</i>

<i>by the people who filmed this for us.
</i>

<i>- Thank goodness.
Again that's Video News...</i>

<i>a professional news gathering service
that we use.</i>

<i>Apparently what we're hearing from
their photographer...</i>

<i>is that they arrived even before
the police...did...</i>

<i>and then entered this home to help or
at least offer some sort of assistance...</i>

<i>and then came upon what you're
looking at here...</i>

<i>- A gruesome crime scene.
He came upon 3 bodies.</i>

<i>- And that right there is the 3rd body.
There's the third body.</i>

<i>Obviously this is a man, gray hair, what
do you think Lisa, maybe 40, 50?...</i>

<i>- Yeah 50's maybe even 60.</i>
Vicious attack!

<i>The only thought I have, we've been
looking at all this graphic footage...</i>

<i>- just the viciousness, the severity of it.</i>
Stand by master control we're coming to a break here.

We're going to commercial then
cutting to Joe...

and a police statement.
<i>- I'm getting word right now that the police...</i>

<i>are getting ready to issue a statement...</i>

<i>- from the scene and Joel Beatty is there for that... </i>
Ready camera 2.

<i>- I think right now we're gonna take a quick break...</i>
Tape 2, take a break in five...

<i>- with more to come on this vicious home...</i>
Four, synching music, three....

<i>- invasion in Granada Hills.</i>
Two, one, fade to black.

That's a ten.

I want theme music on the return...

the cut we used for the scene we
all crash.

Audio, cut 32 please cut 32 when
we come back.

Hello?

Thank you.

Well actually he'd like to meet you.

<i>Heads up you guys, the police spokesman...</i>

<i>- is making an announcement in 60 seconds.</i>
I've gotta go.

Nina, we are getting a ton of heat from
the police out here about that video.

Tell them to call the station.
15 seconds.

They want to talk to the person who
shot it.

I shot it!

Joel it's Video Production News.
Tell them to call me.

Lou, they can't hear you.

Coming back in five...

Four...

Three...

One...

A...

fade up.

HORROR HOUSE

<i>We have more information coming in
from the Granada Hills area...</i>

<i>and a scene of an apparent home invasion...</i>

<i>that has left a husband and wife and
their housekeeper...</i>

<i>What we know at the moment is that
sometime around 5 this morning...</i>

<i>gunmen broke into this upscale...</i>

<i>Citizens are concerned and disturbed by
the brutal triple murder...</i>

<i>The way we got it though is that a
video production crew...</i>

<i>that we work with from time to time...</i>

<i>they apparently arrived on the scene
in Granada Hills...</i>

<i>- before the police ever got there.
Before anybody.</i>

<i>And the photographer who took those pictures
told us earlier that he walked up to the door...</i>

<i>he saw what we all saw in his video tape...</i>

<i>and then he started to look inside so
that he could help...</i>

<i>or render assistance to someone...</i>

<i>that's when he walked into the house and
started shooting the video.</i>

<i>- [Knocking on the door]
He found the 3 deceased in the house...</i>

<i>the 3 females and the one...</i>

Hello
Hi.

I'm Detective Frontieri and this
is my partner Detective Lieberman.

Are you Louis Bloom?
Yes, I'm Lou.

You live here?

Yes, that's right.
May we come inside?

Why?
Why not?

You want to?
Yes.

I don't care.
Wonderful.

You were in Granada Hills last night.
Yes, that's right.

Shot the video in the house?

Yes, ma'am, I did. That's right.

You went inside the house, you...

filmed all through the house?

Even filmed the bodies.

All before the police came.
That door was open, ma'am.

Detective.

The door was open and what I did, was...

I went in to see if I could help,
because the alarm was ringing.

The active crime scene.
I didn't know it was a crime scene.

You knew what it was.

I know that an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

And then sold it to be shown on TV.

We're a professional news gathering service.

What did you see when you arrived?

Two men leaving in a vehicle.

You saw two men.

It was the shapes, I was afraid so I hid...

And then I saw the shapes of two men
moving inside the vehicle. If that helps.

Describe the men.
It was dark.

And then they drove away. I...
Black, white, tall?...

I couldn't see.
What were they driving?

An SUV.

Dark-colored.

Rims, tinted windows?

Maybe. Not that I saw.

Do you have any film on the men
or the car?

No I don't. I only started filming when
I was inside.

I'd like a copy of that footage.

Do I have to give it to you?

Is there any reason why you wouldn't?

No, no. I made you a copy. I expected
someone to come.

AUTO LICENSE PLATE SEARCH

WILL SEARCH FROM 181,857,231 RECORDS

CONTINUE TO NEXT STEP

What's wrong man?

I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

Why we starting so early?

One of the people in the house
last night was alive.

I cut that part out.

I also cut out the men leaving in their car.

I have a name and an address.

We're gonna drive their. We're gonna
find the person that drove that car.

So, you know who killed
those people?

One of them, quite possibly yes.

You gotta call the cops.
And we will, at the right time.

I'm offering you...

a real opportunity here, Rick.

To do what?

I don't usually share my business
plan with you.

But a moment has arrived, that could
allow the company...

to make enough money to expand
to the next level.

We could call this...

the critical moment.

I'm inviting you Rick, to be part of the
team that pounces on this opportunity.

You've been asking a lot about your
performance review?

Yeah.
Well...

for starters...

I've been seeing a great improvement in
your overall focus and order following.

Given complex problems, you're developing a
real ability to find clear and simple solutions.

I am also aware of your
increasing enthusiasm.

It's great to see your eyes light up when
you're working on a new idea.

I hope that you're inspiring us with your
innovative thinking for years to come.

Thank you man. I'm trying, you know.

Which is why I'm promoting you...

to Executive Vice President...

of video news.

What am I now?

You're an assistant.

That...

Does it come with a raise?

Absolutely.

How much?

Pick a number. You pick a number.

100...

$75 per night?

Agreed.

Hey, what about more?

Not now.

We closed the deal.

I could have gotten more, couldn't I?!

Absolutely.

Alright it's coming up on the left.

Halfway down the block. 1701 North Burns.

Is that car?
That's the car.

Oh shit.

Do you think there's a reward?
There is a reward.

How much?
50,000.

Do I get any of that?
I just give you a raise.

But that's salary, I mean like a bonus.

Bonuses come at the end of the year.

So you gonna call it in?
Gonna wait.

For what?

First we want to see if he's actually inside...

and then we want to find a more interesting
place to film the arrest.

Like where?

Anywhere we want.

What we're gonna do is we're gonna wait
and then we're gonna follow...

and when we reach a road that's in a better or
more populated neighborhood...

then we'll report it's location
to the police.

He's a violent wanted criminal. I
can't believe...

he's just gonna peacefully surrender.

Okay, I want more money.

A lot more.

What makes a job desirable, Rick isn't
just the dollar amount attached to it.

You're at the ground floor of a growing
business. Your reward is a career.

Fuck that. You're talking about some
seriously messed up shit.

You're just expecting me to just go along
with it. I want more.

I can't make people do things, Rick.

You have a choice if you want to do this
and I have a choice if you don't.

You trying to fire me?

Hey I've got something too. How about
not calling in criminals...

waiting for them to start some shit so you
can film it. That's against the fucking law.

Yeah cops would be really interested
in that no doubt.

Okay so I want more money.

We can re-open negotiations , Rick.

But remember, when it comes to your
work reputation...

you can't unring the bell.

Well, I want half of whatever we make today.

How did you arrive at that number?

Just two of us sat here, so...

fifty/fifty.
I counter at 10,000.

You don't set the numbers on this. I
want half! I want half.

Well if you're saying I can't negotiate,
then listen.

Just gonna have to give it to you.

Well alright then.

Now I can feel good about it. At
least now I'll go the extra mile.

That's what you never understood, man.
It's been the problem all the time.

You gotta bring people in, Lou, seriously. You
gotta talk to them like they're fucking human beings.

I'm saying this for you dude, for the future.
To help you.

Because you got a seriously weird ass
way of looking at shit.

You know you do.

The trouble is man, you don't fucking
understand people.

Okay?

I'll take the first watch.

Okay.

Guys inside.

He's leaving.

Is that him?
That's one of them.

You're too fucking close, man.

Oh shit.

We're too fucking close.

This guy might have already seen us and
he's pulling us in as a trap.

You ever think of that?

Oh shit.

They're gonna see us. We're in a
red fucking car.

Lower your window please.

Keep your window down.
I'm fucking cold.

Shit they're parking.

Keep going.

<i>911 what's your emergency?</i>

Ah, yes, good evening, hello. I'd like to
report the location of...

2 men responsible for the triple murder
in Granada Hills last night.

<i>What's your address?</i>

I followed them and they just pulled
in the Chinatown Express...

at Western and 3rd.

I can see them inside.

Okay, it's a restaurant called
Chinatown Express...

at Western and 3rd.

That's right. I can see them at the
counter and they're ordering.

These men are wanted for the triple
murder in Granada Hills last night.

<i>- What's your name, sir?
Louis Bloom</i>

<i>Do you have a description of the men?</i>

Yes I do. They're both Latin American men.

Probably what you would call Hispanic.

One is big, very much on the heavy side...

and the other's face is scratched. There
are scratches on his face.

<i>How old are the men?</i>

30, perhaps 35.

<i>What are they wearing?</i>

The big man's wearing light pants and
a striped sweater...

and the man with scratches is wearing
brown pants...

and a vest, he looks like he has a...

gun!

<i>You said the suspect is armed?</i>

I believe so, yes. I'm sorry I have to
go, otherwise they might see me.

<i>[Scanner] All work units possible 187,
suspect is at Western and 3rd...</i>

<i>Western and 3rd at Chinatown Express.
Suspects are two male hispanics...</i>

<i>number 1 large build, number 2 with
scratches on his face.</i>

<i>inside the location and possibly armed</i>

<i>Code 3 Incident 357...</i>

There's fucking people in there.

I count six.

They could start shooting.

They could.
So you said we were waiting for...

a better neighborhood with more people,
not a fucking restaurant.

We work with what we're given.
<i>- [Scanner] Unit 14 responding to that Code 3.</i>

You're going to go down the street and
get an angle inside from over there.

Steady hands, use your zoom...

no fast pans. I'll be filming from here.

Fuck that! I'm not getting out of the car!

I need a second angle from down the
street. We'll cut it together.

The two angles.

Believe me it's more dangerous
here in the car.

I don't believe anything you say.
This is fucked.

Do you know I've never once sworn in
front of an employer.

I'm not doing that. I'm not getting
out of the car.

You're making a mistake.

I don't care about the fucking job title.

What if my problem wasn't that I
don't understand people...

but that I don't like them?

What if I was obliged to hurt you for
something like this?

I mean, physically.

I think you'd have to believe afterward
if you could...

that agreeing to participate...

and then backing out at the critical
moment was a mistake.

Cause that's what I'm telling you.

As...

clearly...

as I can.

<i>[Scanner] 7-A-14, we're close to the location.</i>

<i>7-A-21 provide backing for 7-A-14.</i>

Oh, god.

<i>7-A-21, we're close in with 7-A-14.</i>

Oh my god.

Oh god.

Fuck!

<i>[Scanner] Shots fired! Shots fired!
Officer down. Officer needs help.</i>

Fuck!

Did you get it?
There's people dead in there!

<i>[Scanner] 7-A-27, I'm in pursuit of the
fleeing vehicle.</i>

<i>7-A-27 Roger.</i>

<i>All units on 350 standby...</i>

Aim the camera at the car and
start filming.

<i>7a-27 in pursuit...</i>

<i>The suspect vehicle is a black Escalade</i>

Rick, start filming!

<i>7-A-27, in pursuit on Western Street</i>

Stay on the police car..
You're right up his ass.

Wide angle. We want all of it.

<i>Requesting back up and an air unit.</i>

<i>All air units...</i>

Lou, Lou, Lou!
I got it.

<i>South bound, 70 miles/hour approaching
a bright red.</i>

Steady hands, Rick.

It's a red light. It's a red light.
Red light!

Holy shit!

<i>Give me an ETA on that air unit.</i>

<i>Air units ready for take off, standby.</i>

<i>Heading north bound Western. Suspect
approaching another bright red.</i>

Oh shit!

7a-27, come in.
My God...

<i>- 7A-27, come in.</i>
Did you see that? Did you see that?

<i>We lost 7-A-27</i>

Lou, look out!

<i>7-L-7 I'm in the northbound lane.</i>

<i>Suspect is charging.</i>

<i>7-L-7...</i>

Lou, Lou please. We're way too close!

This guy's crazy! Fucking damn it!

<i>He's ramming my vehicle.</i>

<i>All units outbound Western...</i>

<i>Suspect rammed police vehicle.</i>

No matter what, keep shooting.

<i>North bound...</i>

Fuck!

Oh shit!

Oh my God!

<i>7-L-7 come in.</i>

<i>- 7-L-7 come in.</i>
Turn off the car.

<i>7-L... [Scanner stops]</i>

He's dead. Get this shot.

Steady hands.

Use your zoom.

Put the gun down!

<i>Police radio chatter</i>

You saw him.

You saw him!

I can't jeopardize...

my company's success, to retain an
untrustworthy...

employee.

You're crazy.

You're crazy.

You took my bargaining power, Rick.

You used it against me. You would have
done it again. Just admit it.

I don't know.

I don't...

I know.

I know.

<i>[Background chatter]</i>

Hello, Juliana.

Hello, Willie.

Hello Ben. Hello Lisa.
Hi.

It's Lou, right?

Yes, that's right.
Video News.

That's right.
You got something good for us tonight?

I think so. I'm about to show Nina
right now.

I can tell by your tie, it's Friday.

You can go.

Wasn't that your partner?

As a matter of fact, that's him.

Well I'm sorry.

And it's amazing.

Thank you.

I mean just...

amazing.

Thank you.

No, thank you.

Thank you for bringing it to me.

You're welcome.

I want it, obviously.
How much do you want it?

You tell me.

Take this to graphics.

[Detective] Who's in charge here?
Who are you?

LAPD, major cases.

Pull the footage from those screens,
mount it up. Let's go...

all copies.
Excuse me.

I'm the news director, can I help you?

You can help herself...

by collecting up every copy of the shootout,
the chase, the crash, all of it, now.

It's KWLA property.

It's evidence.
Of what?

I got a cop near death in a hospital.

3 dead, 4 wounded and a dozen major
crimes stretching a mile and a third.

This tape is evidence.
It's news footage...

bought and paid for from an
independent contractor.

Well how do you think you got it?

If there's an issue, speak to him.
Don't get in the way of this.

Unless you have a judges order, we're
going with it in 4 minutes.

Hey...

isn't that him?

<i>Camera 1 stay center there.</i>

<i>Camera 2 we'll do a zoom out when
they come out.</i>

Joel's got a source on the task force
who says they found drugs...

at the Granada Hills house.

Cocaine in wrapped packages, hidden in
crawl spaces, over 50 pounds...

and confirmed it with an investigator
at the scene.

It wasn't a home invasion. It was a
drug robbery.

Give it to the noon crew.

This is news!
It detracts from the story.

It is the story!

The story is urban crime, creeping into
the suburbs. That's the story.

Jesus, you sound like Lou.

<i>[Engineer] 10 seconds to back.</i>

I think Lou is inspiring all of us to
reach a little higher.

<i>Five...</i>

<i>Four...</i>

<i>Three...</i>

<i>Two. ..</i>

<i>One...</i>

<i>Sting it</i>

<i>Mic's. Dissolve</i>

You understand that you've been read
your right to an attorney.

That's right, yes.

And this is being recorded and filmed.

Yes with that camera up there.

In wide angle.

Can you tell me how it is you were at the
Chinatown Express tonight and called 911.

Of course.

It began earlier in the day...

I was watering my plant.

I looked out my window in my apartment,
the one you visited...

and I saw a dark colored vehicle with 2 men
inside parked across the street.

I didn't think anything of it, otherwise
I would have reported it then.

We began our night...

my...

employee and myself.

And around approximately 12:38...

I looked in my rear-view mirror and I
saw what looked like the same men...

in the same vehicle following us.

I made an evasive maneuver, circled back...

And tailed them to the restaurant.

At which point I saw them go inside and
recognized them as the...

same men from the home invasion.

You told me you didn't see the men.

You didn't get a good look at them.
Well...

it all came back to me when I saw
them going in...

the shapes and the movements...

And then I saw that one of the men
had a gun under his shirt and so I...

immediately got my phone and dialed 911.

That's your story?

That's what happened, that's why I'm
sitting here with you.

I think that...

the men saw my footage and...

they tracked me down.

Want to know what I think?

Yes, please.

I think you withheld information.

I think you saw the two men in the
murder house in Granada Hills...

and you saw the car...

and you sat on it.

To get something you could film.

What do you think about that?

I think that would be...

a very unprofessional thing for me to do
in my business.

It would be murder.

I can understand why you're looking
into, but I didn't do anything like that.

Nothing that could be considered wrong.
You don't fool me for a minute.

I'm glad.

I think everything you said is a lie.

I wish my partner was here to backup
what happened.

You left your dead partner.
Well, the ambulances arrived.

They're trained professionals.
Yeah you seem real broken up about that.

Well...

He died doing what he loved.

You filmed him, dying.

That's what I do, it's my job.

I like to say that if you're seeing me your
having the worst day of your life.
