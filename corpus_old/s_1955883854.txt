NOTHIN' BUT A HIGH-PRICED

MESSENGER BOY

TRYING TO BE A BIG SHOT

LIKE HIS BROTHER.

I TOLD THAT LITTLE MEXICAN PRICK

THAT IF HE WANTED

TO DO ANY BUSINESS

ON THE WEST COAST

THAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH ME.

HE DIDN'T LISTEN.

TOO BAD.

YOU PISSED OFF THE COMPETITION.

CARMEN VASQUEZ MAY JUST WANNA

TAKE OVER PABLO'S BUSINESS.

HEY FUCK HIM.

I'LL TURN

THAT FUCKIN' RICE AND BEAN

TO MOTHER FUCKIN' TO DOG BAIT.

NO WETBACK SON OF A BITCH

MOVES IN ON DANNY ABRUZZO.

HIS BROTHER TRIED IT,

NOW HE FRIES IN HELL.

SO YOU HAD HIM SNUFFED.

GARRET, PLEASE HUH.

I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER.

CAPISH?

CAPISH.

I MERELY SUPPLIED

THE RIGHT INFORMATION

TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE,

THAT'S ALL.

I HAD NO REASON TO PUT HIM

IN THE GROUND.

HIS BROTHER HOWEVER...

CARMEN?

CARMEN VASQUEZ

KILLED HIS OWN BROTHER.

WHY?

PABLO WAS TRYIN'

TO MOVE IN ON HIS BROTHER

AS WELL AS ABRUZZO.

WHY THE BIG VENGEANCE ACT?

WHY THE BLOOD BATH?

APPEARANCES.

IF A CARTEL FINDS OUT

HE'D KILLED HIS OWN BROTHER,

WELL, IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST.

YOU SEE HE HAD TO

PLAY THE CHARADE

OR HE'D BE AS DEAD

AS HIS BROTHER.



SAM CALL AN AMBULANCE.

SLADE IS DOWN.


WHAT'S WRONG?

COULDN'T STAY AWAY.

YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

YOU WILL ALSO BE VERY STILL.



VICTOR, TRANQUILO.

TRANQUILO.

YOU REMEMBER VICTOR, SAM?

HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

ITE SEEMS HE BLAMES YOU

FOR THE LOSS OF HIS TONGUE.

YOU SEE I HAD IT PULLED OUT

FOR TALKING TOO MUCH DURING

ONE OF YOUR INTERROGATIONS.

BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM

AND HE'S BEEN FIERCELY LOYAL

EVER SINCE.

HOW ARE YOUR LEGS, SAM?

YOU KNOW, I'M STILL AMAZED

THAT YOU SURVIVED THAT FALL.

BODINES ARE HARD TO KILL.

WHAT DO YOU WANT VASQUEZ?

REVENGE FOR MY BROTHER.

BULLSHIT!

YOU HAD SOMEONE USE HIM

AS A PINCUSHION.

THAT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME

LIKE BROTHERLY LOVE.

HE WAS WEAK.

WEAK AND STUPID.

AND HE HAD NO COJONES.

HE HAD BALLS ENOUGH

TO TRY AND PUSH YOU OUT.

WHERE IS GARRET, SAM?

IN THE ARIZONA STATE PEN.

VICTOR.



NOW THAT WAS A LIE.

IF THERE ARE ANY MORE OF THEM,

I WILL TURN GARRET'S WOMAN

INTO SOMETHING VERY UGLY.

MANOLO [FOREIGN LANGUAGE].

NOW, WHERE IS HE?

I DON'T KNOW.

HE HASN'T BEEN AROUND ALL DAY.

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

SO, NOW WE WILL

FINISH WHAT WE STARTED

SO MANY YEARS AGO

WITH YOUR LEGS.

YEAH.

IT'S A PITY ABOUT AGENT SLADE.

I WANT YOU TO LEAVE GARRET

A MESSAGE.

TELL HIM TO MEET ME TOMORROW

BY 10:00 AM AT DEVIL'S ROCK

OR YOU AND THE GIRL WILL DIE.

YO, SAM!

OFF WORK?


* MUSIC




NEVER HAVE I FELT SUCH SKIN.

IT'S A SHAME THAT SUCH BEAUTY

SHOULD BE EXPOSED

TO ALL THIS UGLINESS.

VASQUEZ!

IT'S 10:00, I'M HERE!

LET THEM GO!

YOU WILL COME IN NOW

OR I WILL SEPARATE

THIS LOVELY HEAD

FROM THIS MAGNIFICENT BODY

AND LEAVE IT ALL

FOR THE BUZZARDS!

ALRIGHT.

ALRIGHT I'M COMING IN!

GARRET!

SAM!

YEAH.

YEAH I'M OKAY KID!

BACK OFF!

SO HERE WE ARE TOGETHER AGAIN.

ONLY THIS TIME SAM,

I'M SURE THAT YOU AND GARRET

WILL DIE.

IT'S STILL A TOSSUP

AS WHO DIES TODAY, CARMEN.


I DON'T THINK SO.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL US

AND GET IT OVER WITH?

NO.

NO QUERIDA.

YOU SEE, I WANT THEM TO KNOW

THAT DEATH IS ONLY MOMENTS AWAY

AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING

THAT THEY CAN DO.

YEAH AND WHAT IF WE WON'T

PLAY YOUR LITTLE GAMES?

YOU'LL PLAY GARRET.

FIRST, YOU'LL LISTEN

TO HER SCREAMS, THEN SAM'S,

AND FINALLY YOUR OWN

BEFORE YOU DIE.


GRACIAS.

I HAVE A LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT

PLANNED FOR YOU.

IT SEEMS THAT ONE OF MY MEN

HAS BEEN CAUGHT

STEALING FROM ME.

EDUARDO.

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

MANOLO.

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE,

PERHAPS YOU WILL GO FREE

AND I WILL BE DEAD.


* MUSIC






AND NOW WE WILL BEGIN THE HUNT.

SAM, YOU AND GARRET

WILL HAVE 15 MINUTES TO GO FAR

AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN

AND WE WILL COME FOR YOU

AND WILL KILL YOU.

VICTOR!

WHAT ABOUT TRACY?

I WILL KEEP HER

AS A SPOIL OF WAR.

AS LONG AS SHE DOES

WHAT SHE IS TOLD--

YOU FUCKING BASTARD!

YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES

BEGINNING NOW.

* MUSIC

LOOK, I'LL STAY HERE

AND TRY TO HOLD THEM BACK.

YOU HEAD TO THE HIGHWAY.

OH YEAH?

WHAT WILL YOU DO?

THROW ROCKS AT THESE GUYS?

DAMN IT GARRET, LISTEN TO ME!

MY LEGS WON'T HOLD.

I'LL JUST SLOW YOU DOWN.

BESIDES THERE IS NO DAMN REASON

FOR BOTH OF US TO BUY IT.

YOU AND ME, WE SPLIT UP.

THE GUYS AND VASQUEZ SPLIT UP.

WE COME BACK AND FREE TRACY.

LET'S DO IT!

* MUSIC

VICTOR, VAMONOS!

MANOLO.

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

* MUSIC

THEY SPLIT UP.

GARRET WENT OFF

IN THAT DIRECTION.

SAM WENT THAT WAY.

KILL HIM.

* MUSIC

STOP IT!

LEAVE ME ALONE!

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


BITCH!

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


SON OF A BITCH!

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


DON'T MOVE ASSHOLES!

ALRIGHT.

IT'S ALRIGHT.

IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT.


WHAT IS IT?

WHAT?

VASQUEZ.

WHERE?

HE'S GONNA--

WHERE IS HE?

HE'S GONNA KILL

GARRET AND SAM.

NO YOU DON'T

YOU SON OF A BITCH!

* MUSIC


* MUSIC


* MUSIC




SAAAAM!

YOU SEE, AS I TOLD YOU,

THIS TIME YOU BOTH DIE.

OH, BUT DON'T WORRY

ABOUT THE WOMAN.

ONE AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE

WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST.

GOODBYE GARRET BODINE.

FUCK YOU!

YOU KILL HIM,

I KILL YOU VERY SLOWLY.

AND I'LL HELP.

SLADE, YOU'RE DEAD.

THEY SAID YOU ARE DEAD!

KEVLAR!

BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMICALS.

NOW PUT THE GUN DOWN.

I SWORE BY MY MOTHER'S EYES

TO KILL YOU.



HERE'S TO THE BODINES.

AND THE END OF CARMEN VASQUEZ.

YEAH.
