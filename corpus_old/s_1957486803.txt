This is nuts! This is so crazy!

and a bag of Crossbone Crunch.

It's a party.

I'm... I'm just so,
so thrilled for you, Kate.

To Comet Dibiasky, right? Cheers!

It's gotta be, lookâ€¦
It's gotta be an Oort cloud comet

just based on where you saw it.

Probably the last time
it was this close to the Sun

was long before human civilization.

Look at the arc on that thing.
God, it's amazing.

How would we find out the comet's
velocity in orbit, Professor Mindy?

That is a good question. [sighs]

This will be fun. I haven't done
orbital dynamics since grad school.

Question is, whatâ€¦

What would Carl Sagan do?

He would take it back to first principles.

The topocentric vector is rho.

Kate, what are the initial coordinates?


Twenty-four.

Thirteen.


Sixty-seven.
Wow. Now you got me pumped.

[man 1] Dr. Mindy.
All rightâ€¦

How many terms do you have to calibrateâ€¦

of coordinates in Marsden, '85.

Now that we have the comet's orbit,
we will check the ephemeris

and that will give us the distance
between the comet and planet Earth.

Why does the ephemeris
keep getting lower and lower?

[breathes deeply]

Professor Mindy?

Professor Mindy?

You know what, guys? Let'sâ€¦

Let's call it a night, huh?

[man 2] But what about
the relative position?

I can't figure this one out.
Not tonight, guys. Sorry.

[man 1] Let's hit it, man. I'm beat.
[woman 2] Me too.

[man 1] Kate, this was amazing.
[man 2] Congratulations.

Hey, Kate.

You stay.

[line ringing]


a Michigan State professor
and his grad students...

This is Dr. Calder.
You pulled me out of a meeting

where I had to tell my team
we lost eight billion in funding.

I am so sorry, Dr. Calder,

but we are seeing some
awfully strange orbital numbers

on this comet we just found.

They should be in your inbox, right?

[Calder] Is this it?
Yeah. This is it.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let me get
Dr. Oglethorpe on the line.

<i>Please hold.</i>

Uhâ€¦ Uh, I'm on hold.

She's calling a Dr. Oglethorpe.
Who is that?

Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna put them on speaker.

[music playing on speaker]

"Dr. Oglethorpe,

head of the Planetary
Defense Coordination Office."

Is that a real place?
I have no idea.

[music continues playing]

[man on speaker] <i>This is Dr. Oglethorpe.</i>

<i>Yes, this is Jocelyn Calder</i>

from Kennedy Space Center.


<i>Listen, we got a sighting</i>

of an NEO from Subaru telescope.

<i>Okay. Uhâ€¦</i>

Why you just didn't report it
to the Minor Planet Center?

<i>and a bunch of Michigan State students</i>

<i>who identified something big.</i>

Really? How large?


<i>We clocked it in around
five to ten kilometers wide.</i>

About five to ten kilometers wide.

Uhâ€¦ That's a big boy.

And, uh, was this professor the one
who first made the observations?

Hi, yes. Uh, Dr. Mindy.

And... And no,
PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky found it.

I did the orbital calculations.

I, uhâ€¦ I study trace gasses
in dead galaxies.

I haven't published in a while
so you probably haven't heard of me.

But anyway, that doesn't matter.

<i>Sorry. What was your question?</i>

What are the most updated estimates
on its trajectory?


Umâ€¦

I've been running it all day.
I keep getting the same result.

A direct hit of Earth
in six months and 14 days.

Me too.

<i>what are your calculations?</i>

<i>Um, Scout program
is saying six months, 14 days.</i>


And it's roughly five
to ten kilometers wide.

Whichâ€¦ Which, uhâ€¦


An extinction-level event?

Well, let's not be dramatic here.

Okay, uhâ€¦

First move is to get
the school field trip out here to DC.


<i>I need the person who first had eyes
on the comet</i>

and the person in charge.

What?

[indistinct chatter]

â€¦share this data immediately
with Cambridge, Caltech and IAU.

Wait a minute.
This is classified information.


<i>at the discretion of the president.</i>

Is this really happening?

â€¦and the dead galaxy professor
to Hickam Air Force base.

Hey! Hey, Kate. [clapping]

<i>This isn't happening, right?</i>

Kate, this isn't real, right? This is, uhâ€¦

This is just some sort
of alternate reality, right?

<i>Say something.</i>

I gotta go get high.

Word is that I need you both in DC fast.
Only plane I got going there is that one.

Anyway, I am Dr. Mindy. This is...

Hi! Oh.
[soldier] Go, go, go!

[soldiers yelling]

[Mindy] Where do we sit, Kate?
I have no idea.

any customary seating forâ€¦

[upbeat tense music playing]

Is this a goddamn joke?

Holy shit.

This can't be happening. No.

[indistinct chatter]

Brendon. You mean Brendon?
Yeah, Brendon.

You know, he didn't keep his head down.
It's all politics, Teddy. You know that.


Yes. Yes, hi.

I'm Dr. Oglethorpe,
but you can call me Teddy.

I'm sorry. Did you say your nameâ€¦

I should call you "Teddy"? Teddy.
[Oglethorpe] Teddy. Yeah.

because he ain't no teddy bear.

General Themes.
I'm the Pentagon's eyes on, uh,

you know, whatever this turns out to be.

The president is famously late,
and you've had a long flight, soâ€¦

[both sigh]

[sighs] Michigan State Spartans.
[Kate] Mmm.

Is that the Oval Office?
Yeah, that's the Oval Office, yeah.

It's a lot smaller
than in the photographs.

should be here shortly.

She's already been briefed.

Correct, Scott?


Are we really about to tell
the president of the United States

that we have just over six months

until humankind, basically every species,
is completely extinct?

[breath trembling] Yeah. That's exactly
what we're about to do. Yeah.




[upbeat instrumental music playing]

[woman 1] Yes, I said law enforcement.

But I didn't wantâ€¦ I mean,
you told me that he was clean.

[indistinct chatter]

Hello, Madam President. Dr. Oglethorpe.

Madam President, I'm Dr. Oglethorpe.
I believe Jocelyn briefed you toâ€¦

Hey, Jason.
[Jason] Yeah? What up, yo?

Come on, man. What the hell?
This is real world.

Yeah. I know. We need five minutes.

We have a problem with our Supreme Court
nominee. Five minutes. Thank you.

and I don't know what's going on.

I don't understand
how many more times I need to tell youâ€¦

Well, there's a bunch of stuff about
their nominee not being qualified,

but I don't see
any articles about our thing.

Social media is just going on and on

about that singer Riley Bina
and DJ Chello breaking up.

That's just too bad.

They seem like sweet kids.

Hmm. I don'tâ€¦ I don't know them.

Which isâ€¦

It's a shame though.
Yeah.

Do you know them, Kate?
Yes.

But I don't really give a shit right now.
Oh.

[footsteps approaching]

They charge
an arm and a leg for this stuff.

Ten apiece ought to do it.
[Mindy] Oh.

[Scott] Grab a water.
Thank you.

I've got Kate as well.

Perfect.
[Kate] Thank you.

Here's a 20.
[Scott] Oh.

No.

Oh!

I'm very sorry. I have to be

What? Are you serious?

This is very important.
I have to go quell the natives.

Tell your daughter I said hello.

Isn't it important that he was

[upbeat jazz music playing]

Where do I pay for these?

It's free.

Really?

Yes, it's the White House.

The snacks are free.

What?

The general.

He charged us
for the snacks, but they're free.

Oh, gosh.


Hey, peeps, uh, it's not looking
like it's gonna happen tonight,

and I feel horrible.

We're gonna put you up
in a hotel somewhere.

Excuse me, does the president
know why we're here?


why we're here, right?

They know. Uh, but you heard 'em.

Do they even realizeâ€¦
[Oglethorpe] Be ready for tomorrow.

â€¦how long it took for us to getâ€¦

[suspenseful music playing]

for over seven hours,

but they never called us in.
I couldn't believe it.

Of course they didn't call you in.
Kate, have you watched any news today?

No, I've been pretty wrapped up
in ourâ€¦ project.

Turn on your TV right now.

President Orlean is in
the middle of an all-time shit storm.

<i>was already a controversial nominee,</i>

<i>with no law degree and a record
of "shoot first and ask questions later."</i>

You watching?

<i>With his background as a nude life modelâ€¦</i>

Yeah, I'm watching it right now.

<i>â€¦the White House is in full crisis mode.</i>

<i>And, get this.</i>

I found five former students

who are willing to go on record
that Conlon got noticeably aroused

when he posed for their drawing class.

<i>I have no shame in what I did.</i>

Now, should I say "noticeably aroused"?

Or "engorged"? Because
I don't want this to read like clickbait.

<i>You know, this is a real article.</i>

I justâ€¦ Kate, can I get
something from you, please?

[clears throat] Sorry.

Out of sorts tonight.
<i>- Can we have this conversation?</i>

I feel like we're skirting around this.

Do you have an issue with my mom?
Is that what this is all about?

[music playing on TV]


It's just the protocol.
Please, don't worry.

Oh, Marshall got a 172
on his LSATs and we're celebrating.

Way to go, Marshall.
I'm proud of you, buddy.

Whoo! Thank you, Dad. Miss you.
[chuckles]

Hey, how's Evan feeling?
Are the new meds working out?

I'm a solid four.
[Mrs. Mindy] Ooh!

<i>He's a solid four.</i>

Well, that's better
than last month, right?

You know, just remember to speak up
in the meeting tomorrow. Okay?

Yeah. I will.
<i>- You get so quiet.</i>

When it's time to take credit,
you kind ofâ€¦

She <i>asked</i> you if you were a lesbian.
She did not say that you <i>were</i> a lesbian.

It was a question.
Hey, look, I'mâ€¦

Can I sit down with your mom
to have lunch in, like, seven months?

Sevenâ€¦ That's weirdly
specific and distant.

<i>What isâ€¦ This is my mom.</i>

[upbeat tense music playing]


I heard there's an asteroid
or a comet or something

that you don't like the looks of.

tell me why you're telling me about it.

You got 20 minutes.

Twenty minutes?
That's you, Doc.


Uhâ€¦ [clears throat]

Madam President. [breathing heavily]

[clears throat] Uhâ€¦

Approximately 36 hours ago,

uh, PhD candidate
Kate Dibiasky here discovered

a very large comet.

Oh.

[Mindy] Yeah.
Good for you.

A comet between
five to ten kilometers across,

that we estimate came from the, uhâ€¦

From theâ€¦ from the Oort cloud.


Which is the outermost part
of the solar system.

And, umâ€¦

And using Gauss's method
of orbital determination

and the average astrometric uncertainty
of 0.04 arcseconds, we then asked...

[chuckling] Whoa! What the hell isâ€¦ What?
I'm so bored. Just tell us what it is.

What? Stop what?
[Jason] Seriously, stop.

What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is
there's a comet headed towards Earth,

and according to NASA's computers,

that object is gonna hit the Pacific Ocean

at 62 miles due west
off the coast of Chile.

Then what happens? Like, a tidal wave?

No. It will be far more catastrophic.

There'll be mile-high tsunamis
fanning out all across the globe.

If this comet makes impact, it will have
the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.

[exhales sharply] There'll be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes...

You're breathing weird.
It's, uh, making me uncomfortable.

I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to articulate the science.

I know. But it's so stressful.
I'm trying to, like, listen...

the gravity of the situation.

I'm trying to articulate it
the best I can...

Madam President, this comet
is what we call a planet-killer.


Mmm-hmm.

So how certain is this?

There's 100% certainty of impact.

Please, don't say 100%.

Can we just call it
a potentially significant event?

[Orlean] Yeah.
Yes.

But it isn't<i> potentially</i> going to happen.

It <i>is</i> going to happen.

Exactly. 99.78% to be exact.

Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.

Well, scientists never like to say 100%.

Call it 70% and let's just move on.

But it's not even close to 70%.

You cannot go around saying to people

that there's 100% chance
that they're gonna die.


We should get some of
our scientists on this, you know.

No offense, but you're just two people
that walked in here with...

Dr. Oglethorpe.

Dr. Ovâ€¦ Ogilvy. Yeah.

I've been head of planetary defense
at NASA for 15 years.

And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at Michigan State,

where Miss Dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate.

[Orlean] Good.
I'm sorry. Did you say Michigan State?

Exactly. They have
an excellent astronomy department.

[Mindy] Yes.
Come on, bro.

You kidding?
You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?

Okay, let's bottom line this.

What is this gonna cost me?

You know, what's the ask here?

There are government plans in place.

Um, actions we can take through NASA.

[Mindy breathing heavily]
Drones that can be outfitted with nukes

to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet.

We must act now.

All right, all right, all right.

When are the midterms? Three weeks.
Three weeks.

So, if this breaks before then,
we lose Congress.

Then there's nothing we can do about it.

It'll be gridlocked.

The timing is justâ€¦ It's atrocious.
[drawer opens and closes]

Okay, at this very moment,
I say we sit tight and assess.


on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.

And you and I will review the NASA plans.

Okay?
I'd greatly appreciate that.

Am I to understand correctly that,

after all of the information
you've received today,

the decision you're making
is to "sit tight and assess"?

I'm sorry, who is she?
Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?

I'm the fucking Chief of Staff,
Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.

So I'm doing fine.

This place is a freak show.

is trying to say

is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely, extremely dangerous...

Oh, oh! [laughing]


Thank you.
One good thing happened today. [chuckles]

Okay, funny story. [clears throat]

When I was running for president,

I had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign

because, you know,
photographs of me smoking

went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?


So, I'm always hiding, but,
you know, I just got sick of it.

And I just said, "You know what,
I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to."


Guess what happened?

I went up three points in the polls.
[Jason] They loved that she kept it real.

They love watching a smokeshow smoke.

I can't think of another president
that I'd ever wanna see in <i>Playboy.</i>

Do you know how many, uh,
"the world is ending" meetings

that we've had over the years?

Economic collapse, loose nukes,
car exhaust killing the atmosphere.

Rogue AI.
Drought, famine, plagueâ€¦

Uhâ€¦
[Orlean] Everything.

population growth, hole in the ozone...

Jason, hey.

Read the room for once in your life.
Sorry, Mom.

Point is, I have a job to do.

You do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event.

This is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds...

Dr. Mindy, I hear you.

I hear you.

You should be proud.
[breathes deeply] Thank you.

I'm taking it very seriously.
I'm taking it straight in the heart.

I'm so glad to hear that.
You have no idea.

Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked
about in here, super classified, right?

[Oglethorpe] Yeah.
Cool.

Thanks for dressing up.

[upbeat tense music playing]

we're just gonna leak it to the press?

Isn't that illegal?
Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.

In case you didn't notice,
the White House just blew us off.

My boyfriend, Phillip,
says he knows a reporter

from the <i>New York Herald</i>
who will talk to us.

Adul Grelio.
Good. He's a heavy hitter.

And I'll reach out to more of
the scientific community on the down-low.

I just feel like this isn't what I do.
You're just telling a story.

Keep it simple.

No math.

But it's <i>all</i> math.

[music continues playing]

[uplifting electronic music playing]

[male voice on video] <i>It all started</i>

[man 1] We love you, Peter!

[audience cheering loudly]

[man 2] We love you, Peter!

Hello, everyone.

All of my life's work,

really, I see has been driven
by an inexpressible need for a friend

who would understand and soothe me.

And you know, now all those years of work
have come to fruition with BASH LiiF,

our new BASH 14.3, uh, phone

is fully integrated
into your every feeling and desire

without you needing
to say one single word.

If I feelâ€¦

Sad.
[boy] Afraid.

Or alone.

The BASH 14.3 phone,
when set to the life setting,

instantly senses my mood
through blood pressureâ€¦

Uh, heartbeats and...
[phone chimes]

[automated voice] <i>Your vitals</i>
<i>show that you are sad.</i>

<i>This will cheer you up, Peter.</i>

<i>You are my best friend â™ª</i>

[singing indistinctly]
<i>â™ª You make me happyâ€¦ â™ª</i>

[Peter laughing] Oh, that's wonderful.

That video. Umâ€¦

It also, seriously, uh, schedules

a therapy session
with a nearby professional,

so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return.

May I say something, Mr. Isherwell?
[Peter] No.

And to support, uh, BASH LiiF,
uh, I wanna officially announceâ€¦

Oh, give me the phones. They're not yours.

[softly] Say bye.
Bye, Mr. Isherwell.

Bye, Peter.

Um, I love you, Peter.

Are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster

is optimizing our prepubescent
sense memory consumer sector?

I find the bird quite threatening.

We will cross-check
the data on that, for sure.

Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent
wanted me to give this to you.

He got it from
an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.

Oh, my.

What other confirmation
do we have on this, Adul?

and he confirmed it and all the math.

Then I showed it
to Dr. Franks at Columbia,

and he almost fell out of his chair.

So, look, I have to admit.
I was very skeptical at first,

but this is all quite credible.

The calculations are credible.

Jesus.

And the president
really said to sit tight?

[Mindy] Yes. That's correct.
"Sit tight and assess."

She's probably worried about the midterms.

We need to move fast.

The feds will claim breach of security,

so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney.

[woman 1] You can use my attorney.
You can certainly afford it now.

We're gonna hire a lawyer?

[woman 1] That wasn't necessary.
[woman 2] It was.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

That was not called for.


How is it criminal if we just tell people,

like the public, you know,
what we saw, and tell them the truth?

Make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows.

He seems a step slow.

What does that mean,
I need media training?

They want us on a show
called <i>The Daily Rip</i>

first thing in the morning
before the article comes out.

You guys know what <i>The Daily Rip</i> is?

It's like the best show.
Everyone wants to be on it.

Brie and Jack have legendary chemistry.

They asked me to go on once.

I was so excited
I couldn't sleep for two nights,

but then they cut me for time.

Still hurts me to think about that.

I know what show you're talking about.
My wife loves that show.

Okay, can you just tell me
what this is all about? Okay?

'Cause you haven't read my article
on Conlon getting hard in the art class.

Now Adul Grelio has come down
from his mountaintop for your thing.

You won't even give me
a lousy pronoun? Come on.

A comet, bigger than the asteroid
that destroyed the dinosaurs,

is headed directly at Earth.

If it isn't deflected,
the entire planet dies.

Wait, what did you just say?

It's for a video game.

Are you being serious?

Yes.

I love your hair.

Thank you.

How are we gonna do this?
I talk about the discovery and youâ€¦

Talk about how urgent it is
that we take action.


Shouldn't we practice it or write it out?
[woman 1] Can I get you some water?

Yeah, water. Yeah, water would be nice.

You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

Riley Bina, you'll come on and...
I get to talk about my single, right?

A portion of the profits
goes to the manatee sanctuaries.

Yes, but the, uh, breakup first.

And then Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky,

you'll come on and talk about
that planet you discovered.

Uhâ€¦ Comet. We found a comet.

They know what we're here
to talk about, right?

Of course. Jack and Brie
love doing science segments.

Just remember, keep it light, fun.

Jack and Brie love having a good time.
[sighing]

That's not promising.

You guys discovered a comet?
That's so dope.

I have a tattoo

Oh.
That's terrific. [chuckles]

We heard about your breakup too,
so we just wanna sayâ€¦

We're very sorry, right?

We're real sorry.
You seem like aâ€¦ great person.

Why don't you mind
your own business, you old fuck?

[girls chuckle]

Okay.

Not gonna lie, but, um, my friends

and my Vroom Vroom Army
have been so amazing.

So, I'm really grateful for that.
But, yeah, I can't lie. It's been hard.

You're an inspiration. It's incredible.
To so many.

You're really owning that pain.

You know, Jack, I feel like
there's some kind of conversation

that we need to be having here.
Is there any message

that you would like
to send to your, uh, ex, DJ Chello?

You know, umâ€¦


Yeah.
Right here in this camera.

Tell him. As if that was him.
You tell him exactly what you're thinking.

Okay, umâ€¦ [clears throat]


Chell.

and, um, after many sleepless nights,

three,

I wanna take you back.

I'm sorry. Whoa, uhâ€¦

Is that okay?
Yeah.

[Brie on TV] <i>He cheated on you.</i>
Oh, my God. You guysâ€¦

Yeah. I do.

Diddly just exploded.
So did Vroom Vroom.

BASH News just sent me
eight push notifications.

About this?
Yeah, look.

My phone just purchased
DJ Chello's latest single.

What theâ€¦ It just did that without asking.

I'm being told that
we have DJ Chello live on a Mugg link.

What's he got to say for himself?
I love the producers here.

<i>Hey, baby doll. Hey.</i>

Hi. Hi, baby. [crying]
[Jack] He's in tears.

<i>- Your kid messed up bad.</i>
I know.

<i>Lady Baroque wasn't wearing
any panties in the club that night.</i>

It's fine.
<i>- I just got all crazy.</i>

<i>I wasn't thinking straight.
I made a mistake.</i>

<i>But, look, it's always been you.</i>

Oh! I get it. It's okay.

<i>I hooked up with her too,
last year at the Music Globes</i>

<i>right before I ran off
with that power forward from the Nuggets,</i>

and none of that matters.

What about "Forget breakup sex.
Try breakup relationship"?

That's good.
Come on.

"Ten famous second chances
for two-timers," guys.

It's on a plate.

<i>I've been scared, but, honestly,
I'm not scared anymore.</i>

Okay.

<i>My little bumblebee, will you marry me?</i>

[gasps] Oh, my God. Of course.
[Jack] Oh, wow.

<i>- Chell, of course.</i>
[DJ Chello] <i>Yes!</i>

<i>- Yes!</i>
That's sick.

[DJ Chello] <i>Yes!</i>

All right, DJ Chello.

[cell phones vibrating]
What is happening?

Just bought another.

Who are these people again?
They're like the biggest namesâ€¦

[Brie chuckles]

Well, the fireworks
have certainly gone off today.

They have.
What a zinger!


From a wedding proposal
to a little science experiment.

I'll need a temple rub
and a martini later on.

a pretty big discovery in space.

Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy

and PhD candidate
Miss Kate Dibiasky are here.

Welcome to the show.

Can I ask you one thing before we go
any further? I have to know this.

Is there life out there?

Can you tell us? Yes or no, final answer.
We don't have the data.

But sure, in the vastness
of space, why not?

Yes, aliens are real.

I knew I'd like this guy.
Didn't I tell? You owe me 50 bucks.

little green men in flying saucers...

Please don't encourage him, Dr. Mindy.
That's what he's saying.

We'll never get out of here.

Now, Jack was having some fun here.

Dad looks great.
What didâ€¦

Doesn't he look good?
They did something with his beard.



[Jack] So much.
[Brie chuckles] Dr. Randallâ€¦

You'll regret it. Now, look,
Jack's just having some fun here

with the aliens or whatever,

but there's a <i>New York Herald</i> story
that's just come out that talks aboutâ€¦

Keep it right there. You're doing good.

â€¦the two of you have made.
[Mindy] That's right, Brie.

Kate was, um, observing supernovasâ€¦

Yo, that's your girl?

Yeah.
Not bad.

â€¦an absolutely shocking
and once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

I had no idea that Subaru made telescopes.

This has to be exciting.
Tell us what you found, Miss Diabasky.

Um, I was monitoring exploding stars

to help measure
the expansion of the universe and...

For your PhD, right?
Yeah.


<i>It was a comet.</i>



It's headed directly at Earth,
and it really likely will hit.

This sounds very, very exciting.

Exploding stars, like,
stars actually explode.

Um, how big is this thing?

Can it destroy someone's house?
Is that possible?

Well, Comet Dibiasky, which is
what it will officially be named...

[Jack] After her?
Yeah, after her.

[Brie] Congratulations.
[Jack] What an honor. Congratulations.

It's somewhere between
six and nine kilometers across.

So...
It's big.

It would damage the entire planet.

Not just a house, you know?

The entire planet.

Okay, as it's damaging,
will it hit this one house in particular

that's right on the coast of New Jersey?
It's my ex-wife's house.

Can we make that happen?

You and Shelly have
a great relationship. Stop.

You need to stop.

I will, but in all fairness,
I actually paid for the house.


I'm sorry, are we not being clear?

We're trying to tell you

that the entire planet
is about to be destroyed.

[Jack] Okay, umâ€¦
[Brie] Well, it's, you knowâ€¦

It's something we do around here.
We just keep the bad news light.

Right. It helps the medicine go down.

Speaking of medicine, tomorrow we've got...

Well, maybe the destruction
of the entire planet

isn't supposed to be fun.

Maybe it's supposed to be terrifying.

<i>And unsettling.</i>


<i>- And you should stay up all nightâ€¦</i>
[Adul] Please.

â€¦every night crying,

when we're all 100%
for sure gonna fucking die!

[crying]
Hey, Kate.


Hey, man.

My brother has bipolar disorder.
So if you ever need anyone to talkâ€¦

Uhâ€¦ [inhales sharply]
Okay.

Is she always like that?

I...
[Brie] Something I said?

[Jack and Brie chuckle]
[Jack] Right?

Maybe I should have given her
that extra Xanax that I had.

[Jack and Brie chuckle]

Listen, if you don't have enough,
we all have enough around here for her.

A spoonful of Xanax
makes the medicine go down, right?


We're gonna have to get you back.
[Jack] I knew I'd like this guy.

Is he a plant? [laughing]
[Jack] I knew it.


Well, the handsome astronomer

can come back anytime,
but the yelling lady, not so much.

when our guest will be the man

that many say will challenge
President Orlean in two years.

Senator Jeff Lerner will be here.

And wrongly-convicted murderer,
Michelle Weems,

talks to us about her controversial
third-place finish on <i>Celebrity Dance Off.</i>

I thought she would've won.
Yes. I still think she's guilty.

That's <i>The Daily Rip,</i> guys.
[Brie] Have a great day.

[producer] And we're out!
The show's over?

I mean, didn'tâ€¦
[Jack] Yeah.

Did what we wanted to say come across?
No, it's over.

You were great, but I think mullet girl,
she probably needs some media training.

Really?
Yeah, no, terrible, buddy.


Uh, we usually get drinks at Aundrine's
after our five o'clock staff meeting.

You know, it's fun. You should come.

Oh, I'll have to see.
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.

Mmm-hmm.

Kate? Kate?

Hey. You were awesome.
Oh, thanks.

Can I get a photo of you for my portfolio?

Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

[camera clicks]
Thank you.


is when Riley Bina
asked to take DJ Chello back

on the segment before you.

We saw engagement across
all social media platforms.

Hmm. And what about our story?


{\an8}your TV appearance got some nice traffic
when Miss Dibiasky cursed.

{\an8}But, unfortunately,
there was an immediate backlash

{\an8}- that quickly became a meme.
[Kate gasps]

Oh, Jesus.

Oh, that's terrible.
They just think I'm crazy.

I mean, look at that.
That's so unnecessary.

You can move on, Erin.
Yeah.

That is just soâ€¦
Is that even allowed on the Internet orâ€¦

I think that's Photoshop, Kate.

to not take it personalâ€¦

had some very high favorables.

Veganâ™ªBabe wrote,
"Meow! Me likey hunky Star Man."

Uh, some accounts called him
"The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet"

or A-I-L-F, which means
"astronomer I'd like to fuck."


I don't see what that has
to do with anything, do you?

And that's everything.

We did not feature or push on any sites,

and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories.


So thatâ€¦ Thatâ€¦ That's it?

[Kate] I knew it.
That's it.

Thank you, Erin.
[Erin] Yeah, no problem.


I don't understand. There's no response.

There's absolutely noâ€¦
Why aren't people terrified?

What do we have to say?
What do we have to do?

There are scientists in Mexico and Spain
who are currently going through the data,

and, uh, South Korea has expressed...

That's great. South Korea.
Hey.

Let us not bullshit each other.

The bottom line is,
you guys told us the science was 100%.

It's not. Now we look like idiots.

No. Who said the science is not 100%?
Excuse me?

I wanna talk to this person.
You tell me who said the science...

Dr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA,

just came out calling it
"more near-miss hysteria."

She's the one
who told us not to say anything.

"More near-miss hysteria."

Is she even an astronomer?

She's the head of NASA, but maybe
she doesn't know what she's talking about.

She's the head of NASA, but look,

she's a "former anesthesiologist
and a President Orlean super donor."

Let's not be dramatic here.

It's all corrupt.

Yes, but the point is that Adul's right.
There's still serious debate.

And now the <i>Herald</i> has egg on its face.

We've taken that story as far as it goes.

Ladies, gentlemen,
I wish you a very pleasant end of times.


We have precisely six months, ten days,

two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds,

until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub

tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on Earth.

do those calculations?

I put the moment of impact on a diet app.

So, impact is when my diet ends.

Only I'm not on a diet.
I'm just crying five times a day.

I'm scared.
Hey, come on. Come on.

Everyone should be
panicking right now, okay?

Don't cry. Come on.
[Kate] I know.

[cell phone chimes]


That prick!

[upbeat tense music playing]


Guess my boyfriend just broke up with me.

God, what a day. What a dayâ€¦
[crying]

You're gonna die!
You're gonna die! You'reâ€¦

[slow rumbling]

[reporter on TV] <i>It started with</i>
<i>a photo many thought was an armpit</i>

<i>or the chin of a man with a strange beard.</i>

<i>But what's emerging now is a scandalâ€¦</i>

{\an8}<i>President Orlean sent
her Supreme Court nominee</i>

{\an8}<i>a cell phone picture of her private parts.</i>

<i>- Holy crap!</i>
[woman] <i>It's clickbait material.</i>

<i>Is this what you want

<i>Isn't she the same person

<i>She actually said that.</i>

{\an8}<i>A source also confirmed to me that</i>

Someone's here to see you.

Who? Oh, boy.

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, God, right. Okay.

Right.

Are you Dr. Randall Mindy?

Fuck off, please.

[Orlean chuckles] I think
it was Winston Churchill whoâ€¦

Or maybe it was Bobby Knight
who said, "The great labor of leadership

is to lay down one's yoke of pride

and admit that mistakes were made."

as was I, but the end result was,

we had our scientists who went to,
uh, the prestigious schools of Harvard,

Princeton, et cetera.

They confirmed the data.
So we would like to offer you aâ€¦

Presidential apology.

Really?

And we are fully prepared to mobilize

in historic fashion
in order to save this planet.


we've heard in a long time.

So, basically, what you're saying is

you're about to lose the midterms
'cause you got caught

sending pictures of your cooch
to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.

So now it's to your advantage
to act on the comet?

Right.



that you guys are doing something.

Hey, come on. Hey.
This has been reallyâ€¦

[crying] Really, really hard.
Come here.

This has been really, really,
really stressful on all of us.

Yes, I will agree.

This will take some
heavy weight off all of us...

so bad when you cry.


People are gonna ask
why we didn't act earlier.

So you're gonna have
to take the hit on this one.

Yeah, but we'll take care
of you down the road, Jocelyn.

We will.
Of course, Janie.

I will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow.

[Orlean] Good. Yeah, good.
That's weird as hell.


I'm going to make a statement,

presidential statement
to the American people.

And we're not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time

because that way
it will have the appearance

of a breaking emergency sort ofâ€¦

[cheers and applause on TV]

[rhythmic music playing on TV]

[man on TV] <i>We interrupt this broadcast</i>
<i>of</i> Jackpot FiancÃ©

<i>for an emergency message
from the president of the United States.</i>

<i>Citizens of the United States
and peoples of the world,</i>

<i>I have just been handed</i>

scientific findings that
confirm a worst-case scenario.

An unprecedented comet,
nine kilometers wide,

is now on a direct collision course
with our cherished home, planet Earth.

{\an8}<i>Estimated time of arrival
is approximately five months from now.</i>

{\an8}<i>So we haveâ€¦</i>

We've drawn up a massive
Congressional spending billâ€¦

I have already put together an emergency
spending package for Congressâ€¦

and the House have agreed upon.

That's good to hear.

<i>And that will enable NASA
and our great military</i>

<i>to launch a preemptive strike,</i>

using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites

loaded with nuclear explosives.

We will blow Comet Dibiasky
off her courseâ€¦

But we're gonna need a hero.

We're gonna need a pilot, real guns andâ€¦

Shouldn't this mission be accomplished
using remote technology?

Washington's always gotta have a hero.

I have asked

Medal of Freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot, Benedict Drask,

<i>to undertake this difficult andâ€¦</i>

Isn't he the mercenary gentleman

that was screaming at all those children
on the White House lawn?

He was given the honor of leading

the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise.

Get a little air into it, you lard-assâ€¦

You look like a goddamn bunch of pussies.

[Mindy] I'm sorry.
He's just of another generation.

You know, I used to date him.

Know what happened to the last pussy
I worked with in combat?

You ever see inside a man's torso?

[cheers and applause]

Benedict Drask reporting for duty.

<i>- Thank you for theâ€¦</i>
He's gonna be fantastic.

{\an8}He's got a great voice.

{\an8}- We're gonna let him make a statement.
<i>- Some are saying this is aâ€¦</i>

He's got a great body too.

[Calder] <i>He does.</i>
[Orlean] <i>Yeah.</i>

<i>â€¦suicide mission.</i>

Well, all I ask is,

if I get snuffed,

that you all earn
the extra living my sacrifice gives you.

The extra living
my sacrifice gives them. [gasps]

{\an8}- Right?
I wrote that.

Isn't that from <i>Saving Private Ryan?</i>

Yes.
No, that's something totally different.

And special thanks should also go
to this team of scientists behind meâ€¦

<i>everybody's help on this.</i>

Everybody.

All have to pitch in
and push out this message.

Miss Dibiasky, sheâ€¦

And we have Kate Dibiasky,

but don't blame her.

and the mentally ill.

And other marginal groups.
Thank you.

[Oglethorpe] We'll do whatever we can.
As long as you do the right thing.

We're there for you.

Especially you, Dr. Mindy,
because you poll so much higher

than your colleagues.
It's wild. [laughing]

He will help us destroy
our common enemy, Dibiasky.

Wonderful. Well, I think we're done.



We've been dying to hear
what you gotta say.

I didn't vote for you.

But this is obviously
much bigger than my misgivings.

So I will be 100% behind this effort.

No matter how offensive I may find you.

Hmm. Wow. That's great.


You know, I did have the FBI
put that bag over your head.

They don't do that.
The CIA does, but I made them do it.

You know, I had a feeling. I really did.

It's a good feeling
'cause that is what I did.

And it was very funny and cool. [laughs]
[Orlean] Okay.

May Jesus Christ
bless every single one of you,

especially the honorable members
of my own party.

We will prevail.

Wow.

Two former presidents. Wow.

What, my turn?
[chuckles] Yeah.

Oh. All right. My fatherÂ was

My mother,
she cut hair out of the kitchen.

Uh, about two years ago,
our family dog, JoJo, died,

which was really, really emotional.

I can't remember crying that much ever.

I was in the Navy.

Nope. It's turning around.

some confusion here amongst the crowd,

but I'm not gonna lie to you.

This reporter
is at a loss for words right now.

It's definitely turning around.

I'm looking straight at it.

Drask's ship is definitely turning around.

Does anyone know
what the fuck just happened?

It's still locked.

I just don'tâ€¦ I don't understand
what could've happened.

I mean, the mission was working, right?
Everything was on track.

Yeah. I mean,
it could've been anything, uhâ€¦

Guidance system could've malfunctioned,
uh, nuke destabilized, myriad of things.

Who was that guy that walked into
the Situation Room? He looked familiar.

That was Peter Isherwell, CEO of BASH,
and the third richest human ever.

He's the guy that, uh, bought
the Gutenberg Bible and lost it.

[door opens]


Things are, uh, extremely fluid.

Dr. Randall, you are now the Chief
Science Advisor to the White House.

What?

As such, you need to attend
an emergency Cabinet meeting

where you will be debriefed.

What about us?

You do not have clearance
for this, sweetheart. Don't trip.

Got you some crackers, some waters.

You don't need to throw it on the floor.

Gonna be three, four hours, tops.

Here, Kate. I don't know
why he threw 'em down. Here.

What if we have to go to the bathroom?

We'll lay out some newspaper for you.
Grab you a can of Febreze.

and simple science.

I'll be back. All right. Come on.

Science tells the truth, Randall.


Fuck. Do you wanna come?

Yeah.

what we thought,

what the world thought
was an impending and terrifying danger,

turns out to be
an astonishing opportunity.

Our allies are very confused
and demanding answers...

Well, tell 'em to wait.

According to the most recent
spectrometer readings of Comet Dibiasky,

made by the astrogeologists
at BASH Cellular,

we've discovered something.

Something truly miraculous.

Peter. Peter?

Oh, thank you, Janie.
[chuckles]

As, uhâ€¦ As some of you may know,

the most valuable minerals in the world

are fast becoming those that are deployed

in the manufacture
of cell phones and, uh, computers.

Yttrium, terbium, osmium, dysprosium,
on and on and on.

We're running short.

Uh, and the problem
is exacerbated, of course,

because China has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines

that produce
these valuable rare Earth assets.

So you can imagine. [laughing]

Wow!

Just how happy we were at BASH

when our astrogeologists discovered

and then determined that this comet,
hurtling towards us from deep space,

actually contains at least $32 trillion
of these critical materials.

Critical to technology.

If we're to proceed...

I'm sorry. Is that why
you aborted this entire mission,

is because you're trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals?

we should hold all questions

until the end of the presentation,

and you might find
that your questions are answered.

Yes, Madam President.

When youâ€¦
When the other metals are factored in,

the comet actually contains

almost $140 trillion worth of assets.


[Orlean] Yeahâ€¦
[laughter]

What do these trillions of dollars
even matter if we're all gonna die...

the same question, Janie.

Why weren't we consulted?

All due respect, Madam Presidentâ€¦

Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?

again and again and again in my head

and I still can't make sense of it.

He's a three-star general.
He works at the Pentagon.

Why would he charge us for free snacks?

One time, I met Sting,

and I swear to God,
he farted right in front of me.

Didn't break eye contact
and didn't even say "excuse me."

And the thing is,
he actually pulled it off. [chuckles]

'Cause I still found him
to be quite charming.

Come on, let's go. Come on, now.

It's insane. Like, completely insane.


I had the exact same reaction.

This is a nine-kilometer-wide
planet-killer we're talking about,

not roaming charges.

Look, Iâ€¦ I was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too,

but they've got
Gary Talcamont from Stanford

and Lisa Inez from Princeton
on their team.

I mean, this is next-generation
cutting-edge technology.

Obviously, one giant comet is a major
and existential, uh, threat to our planet,

but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.

Our BEADS, that stands for
BASH, uh, Explore and Acquire Drones,

that you see here,

attach themselves to the comet

and scan it with nanotechnology

developed by
Nobel Prize-winning scientist,

Dr. Gary Talcamont.

And then we immediately deploy, don't we?

Nobel and Polonsky prize-winning scientist

Dr. Inez's micro-targeted,
quantum fission, uh, explosives.

You see, deep into the objectâ€¦

Dr. Inez, would you like
to explain what's happening?

Thank you, Peter.

We've been developing
phase-fission reactions

in the CERN particle accelerator

that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces

with breathtaking accuracy.

These segments are then steered
and decelerated by each BEAD

into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation
by waiting US Navy ships.

And when theseâ€¦ Thank you.

And when these treasures
from heaven are claimed,

poverty as we know it,
social injustice, loss of biodiversity,

all these multitudes of problems

are just gonna become relics of the past

and humanity is gonna stride through
the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin naked

into the the glory of a golden ageâ€¦

And is this nanotech work peer-reviewed?

Well, I haven't reviewed the data,
but it's been modeled.

Has any of this been peer-reviewed?

Nope.

Interplanetary, interstellar,

intergalactic existence
for the human race.



I understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet,

it can end world hunger.

[Oglethorpe] Oh, I see.
[Kate laughing]

Why are you laughing?
[Oglethorpe] That's true. No, I see.

So that's the pretty little bow they're
putting around this line of bullshit.

I bet they'll say freedom and puppies too.

All right.
Yeah.

You want me to quit the mission?
I'll quit the mission. That's fine.

But you have to understand,
this is now beyond our control.

They have all the power.

So who do you want
in the actual room to make sure

this whole thing doesn't turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster?

Jason Orlean?
You want Jason Orlean in that room? Huh?

I have news for you.
It's already a complete disaster.

They're talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain

hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone company's stock!

You better take that down
about four or five notches now.

Were you yelling about that mission?
Why were you talking about cell phones?

My friend was just theorizing
as to what's going on.

We're confused too.

That's an awfully official-looking
White House badge you got there.

I don't know why I have this on.

Listen, just tell us what's going on.

I got three scared kids at home.
Just tell us something.

I understand.
I wish I could share information, but...

We're people just like you.
We deserve to know!

They're right.

They deserve to know.

Do you really wanna know what's going on?

[woman] Yeah.
[man] Please.

[Oglethorpe] Kate, don't. Kate.
[Mindy] Kate.

They found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet.


So they're gonna let it hit the planet

to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich!


[people clamoring]

[people shouting and screaming]


â€¦everything I could, they won't listen.


Now, I'm starting to think
you just like riling people up.

I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I am.


Where's Brie Evantee?

Shouldn't you two
be playing footsie in a restaurant

that only serves cubes and foam?

Well, she ain't wrong.
You did lose the thread in a big way.

And what do you suggest we do?
An online petition, huh?

You want to holdâ€¦
Get a mob and hold up picket signs?

You wanna overthrow the government?
I mean, look at this.


White House wants her off the grid.

Come on, now. Look...
[agent] Now.

What the hell does that mean?

What does "off the grid" mean?
[Mindy] Hey, Kate.

Oh, gosh. Kate! Are you okay?

[people shouting indistinctly]

Teddy, come on!
What choice do I have here?

A man's always got choices, Randall!

Sometimes you just gotta
choose the good one!

[dog barking]

[uneasy music playing]


the charges against you are
violation of national security secrets,

inciting a riot,
and destruction of private property

owned by Bojo Mambo's Shrimp LLC.

What? I didn't...

However, the Attorney General
is willing to not pursue prosecution

if you will agree to the following:

"The suspension
of all public media appearances

and incendiary language relating to
Comet Dibiasky and BASH Cellular."

Fine. Give it to me.
I don't give a shit anymore.

Mom. Dad.


Unlock the door.

No politics. None.

What are you talking about?

Your dad and I are for the jobs
the comet will provide.

[Kate scoffs]

The divisions in this country
are bad enough.

We don't want more of that in our house.

[serene music playing on TV]
[laughing] <i>Whoa!</i>

<i>- Slow down, kids.</i>
[boy] <i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

<i>I worry about my kids and their future.</i>

<i>Sure, the jobs
the comet's gonna create sound great.</i>

<i>What if it's not safe?</i>

{\an8}<i>Right now, millions of you are having
these same doubts and questions</i>

{\an8}<i>about the approaching comet.</i>

{\an8}<i>That is why BASH Cellular</i>

<i>in conjunction with
the United States Government</i>

<i>is creating a new hotline, free of charge,
to answer all of your questions.</i>

<i>And who knows? Maybe,
just maybe, one of our scientistsâ€¦</i>

<i>Thank you, Sharon.

[Brie laughing] So, I thought he was
the ambassador. I was just flattering him.

Now he's got an ego the size of Texas.

Oh, my God.

June, what, uhâ€¦
What are you doing here, sweetie?

Had a feeling
something was going on and justâ€¦

we're discussing important business.

That's what we're doing.
Oh, yeah, that's really very important.

Oh, can we just
skip past this part, please?

Where you get to feel self-righteous

and we put our tails between our legs.
It is just so boring.


You wanna skip the part where
you feel bad for screwing my husband?

Ohâ€¦ No, I don't feel bad.

Randall and I are having a wonderful time.
So, I think the question is,

do we keep having a wonderful time
or does he go back with you to Wisconsin?

Or Montana.

Michigan?
Michigan.


You know, umâ€¦ she is actually right.

That's the only question. Soâ€¦


[breathing heavily]
Sometimes in life things are, you know,

they're complicated and they just...

[Mrs. Mindy] Oh, okay.

Oh, that was fast, umâ€¦

[clicks tongue]

Well, before I go, um,

let me just give you some instructions

on how to take care of Randall.

Uhâ€¦

Yeah, here's the Xanax
he takes for his panic attacks.

Oh, gosh.

Here's the Zoloft he takes
for the crashing depressions.

Not so much recently. Okay, you know...
Oh! Oh, good for you. Great.

Uh, this is for his blood pressure.
Ow.

Restless leg syndrome, that's a fun one.
God.

Oh. Appetite suppressant to counteract
the weight gain from his other meds.

And, uh, for America's sexiest scientist,
a bottle of goddamn Cialis!

Ow! Gosh.

Goodbye. Goodbye, Randall.

I guess I'll just tell your sons

that Dad's fucking
the lady on our television.

June, Iâ€¦

I really thought for a second
that was gonna work out.

[door closes]
[sighs]

<i>People, they wanna
manage the comet to create jobs.</i>

<i>Thirty-seven percent
don't want the comet to hit.</i>

<i>That's actually down by three points.</i>

<i>And 23%, they don't think
there's a comet at all,</i>

<i>and that number is way up.</i>

Not Bitcoin, RatCoin. RatCoin.

[indistinct chatter on TV]

I'd like to buy these sunglasses.

You that girl from live TV
who said we're all gonna die?

No. What's your purchase?


What the fuck?

Yeah, that's you. It's definitely you.
Yep, that's me.

Holy shit. You're a stone-cold legend.
Word is bond.

I got a picture of you on my board.

Picture on his fucking board.


If you don't have one, get out of line
and make room for other customers.

Can I touch your hair in a non-sexual way?

Get the fuck away from me.
Oh, dude, have someâ€¦ Umâ€¦

Call Diogo, he'll freak out.
Will you say hi to my friend?

Dude, he's obsessed with you.
We love you. We don't likeâ€¦

Can't stand Orlean, either.

Yo, yo, yo!
[Diogo] <i>Yo!</i>

What's up? Yo, check outâ€¦

Yo, shut the fuck up.
Check out who we're with.

Yo, bro! What up?
<i>- What up?</i>

[laughter and chatter]

I mean, we have a purchase,
but we don't have payment,

which is a metaphor onâ€¦

Cash?
[man] <i>Also, Phillip, I've been toldâ€¦</i>

Right.
<i>- â€¦That you wrote a book</i>

<i>about your past relationship
with Kate Dibiasky.</i>

<i>Funny you should say that,
I'm working on that now.</i>

<i>It's gonna be called</i>
A Brush With The Devil, <i>and it's, uhâ€¦</i>

You calling security
or something, with your eyes?

No. You're free to go.

[man] <i>That sounds terrible.</i>
Just like that?


You don't give a shit, do you?

Sure, I do.

I care about DrinkMo's guarantee
of quality service.

Well, we don't give a shit either.

Not one single shit.

We hang and board behind the abandoned
Burger Crown from 7:00 to whenever.

Yeah, we do.

You should come hang.
If you're not a fucking pussy.


Fuck. Okay. Thanks.
<i>- â€¦And a bottle of scotch.</i>

<i>It's a joke. But alsoâ€¦</i>

{\an8}[dramatic music playing]


uh, to mankind's savior,
BASH Explore and Acquire Drone.

It's incredible.

It's incredible, isn't it?

I call this one Primo,
the first. [laughing]

It's like my first child.

Primo, my boy.
It's your father, Cronos. [laughing]

Don't be shy. Come on.
You're gonna be a god in the sky.


Are you at all concerned about
the sync on the BEAD explosions?

Oh, Doctor.
There are always questions and fears, andâ€¦

I have a report here from a Dr. Inez.

If you'd just take a look at this study.
Oh, thanks.

Listen, a lot of my colleagues,

they've either been removed
or resigned from this project,

apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here.

So I just wanna make sure that you'reâ€¦

That you're open
to the scientific peer-review process

and you're not approaching
this mission like a businessman.

You know? That...
What did you say?

I wanna know if you're...
Did you call me a businessman?

You do own a corporate...
You think I'm just a businessman?

Do you think you know me, Doctor?

Business?

This is evolution.
This is evolution of the human species.

What are you doing bringing thisâ€¦
[Orlean] Well...

You know that BASH has
over 40 million data points on you,

on every decision you have made
since 1994, Doctor?

Iâ€¦ I know when you have colon polyps

months before your doctor does.

You got four or five
at the moment actually.

You know, they're not of concern,
but I'd have a checkup as soon as you can.

But much more importantly than that,
I know what <i>you</i> are. I know who you are.

My algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types.

You are a lifestyle idealist.

You think you're motivated
by beliefs, high ethical beliefs.

But you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain.

Like aâ€¦ Like a field mouse.


[inhales deeply]

I just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project.

I hope you understand...

Our algorithms
can even predict how you'll die.

To 96â€¦ 96.5% accuracy.

I looked you up after we met.

Your death was so unremarkable and boring.

I can't remember the details,
apart from one thing.

You're gonna die alone.

Alone.

If you'll excuse me, Madam President.
I've got some work to do.


My God.
I was trying to do my job.

You are just so lucky
that Peter adores you.


You're with the grown-ups now, Randall.

I can't even follow this shit anymore!

[music playing on speakers]
[indistinct chatter]

BASH got Orlean to pay
the Chilean government, if I'm correct,

$90 billion to let the tsunami
hit off the coast of the country.

That sound right to you?

[man 3] Isherwell built
an underground bunker

for him and all his executives.

No, I heard that
they built an escape ship.

You guys,
the truth is way more depressing.

They're not even smart enough to be
as evil as you're giving them credit for.

[glass shatters]

[people clamoring, cheering]

Ugh!

What?
No.

[people shouting]

Fuck! You're driving me fucking
crazy, Kate. [chuckles nervously]

Fuck it. We're all gonna die.

<i>And the early word is
it's already a classic, Brie.</i>

<i>Well, and what a stellar cast.</i>

Devin. Yeah.
I love Devin Peters.

<i>He's great. Everything he does.</i>

<i>- What's it called again?</i>
[Jack] <i>It's called </i>Total Devastation.

It cost $300 million to make.
[Brie] Whoo!

I mean, these movies...
[laughs] It's more than you earn.

And my friend Farley, he saw it.

He said it's a ton of fun. That's right.
Well, Farley likes it.

All right, well, what Farley says goes.

<i>But, uh, first,</i>

and yes, you can tell from my smileâ€¦


That America's sexiest scientist is here.
Dr. Randall. Welcome.

Dr. Randall, how are you, sir?

I'm gooder than good.


All right. So, Randall, we're hearing
that there is no comet,

or that there is a comet but it's
a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.

<i>We are so confused.</i> [chuckles]

So, could you please help us out here,
you know, oh, wise scientist?

Well, first and foremost, Brie, umâ€¦

is a comet.


And we know that there is a comet
because we have the data.

Umâ€¦ [clears throat]

There has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late.

You see, the peer-review process
is absolutely essentialâ€¦

If BASH's stockâ€¦
â€¦for us to get to the facts ofâ€¦ Yes?

If BASH's stock is any indicator,

we don't have to worry
about the peer review.

It is going gangbusters.

And full disclosure.
I bought as many shares as I could.

I advise you to do the same.

You are such a shameless capitalist.

Said the woman who will be
in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck

when I put it in from the stock.
You know me too well.

That's right.

Dr. Randall, you sure you're okay?
You want a glass of waterâ€¦

I don't feel so good.

to commercial break...

No, Please, Brie. Don't cut away.
Let me say something.

Okay.
You came to the right place.

We like to say things.

Would you please
just stop being so [bleep] pleasant?

I'm sorry, but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever

or charming or likeable all the time.

Sometimes we need to just be able
to say things to one another.

We need to hear things.

Look, let's establish, once again,

that there is a huge comet
headed towards Earth.

And the reason we know
that there is a comet

is because we saw it.

We saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope.

I mean, for God's sake,
we took a fucking picture of it!

What other proof do we need?

And if we can't all agree
at the bare minimum

that a giant comet
the size of Mount Everest

hurtling its way towards planet Earth
is not a fucking good thing,

then what the hell happened to us?

I mean, my God, how do...
How do we even talk to each other?

What've weâ€¦ What've we done to ourselves?
How do we fix it?

We should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance,

but we didn't do it.
I don't know why we didn't do it.

And now they're
actually firing scientists like me

for speaking out, for opposing them.

And I'm sure many of the people out there

aren't even
gonna listen to what I just said

'cause they have
their own political ideology,

but Iâ€¦ assure you,

I am not on one side or the other.

I'm just telling you the fucking truth.

This would be a good time to establish

that Isherwell and the president
have both said

that there's benefits to be...

Right, well, the president
of the United States is fucking lying!

Look, I'm just like all of you.

I hope to God, I hope to <i>God</i> that
this president knows what she's doing.

I hope she's got us all taken care of,
but the truth is,

I think this whole administration

has completely lost their fucking mind!

And I think we're all gonna die!

[breathing heavily]



I just wanna go home more than anything.

[breathing heavily]

But if there is one thing,

one thing that I prayâ€¦

That I pray that all of you hear
from what I have just said,

is that all of us, all of usâ€¦

[car door opens]


Why'd you do that?

I really liked you
and I despise most people.

I really thought I loved you.

Really?

Wow.


Yeah.
[car door opens]

We gotta get this man off the grid.


No.

on the power, you know,

like any kind of power.

It's like he knew eventually that I was
gonna find out that the snacks were free.

Right.
You know what I mean?

Yeah.
So it was just like a power play.

Yeah, guys are weird.

I'm starting to think that all this
"end of the world" stuff is bullshit.

It's not.

It's definitely happening. I've seen it.

I feel like if God wanted to destroy
the Earth, He would destroy the Earth.

You believe in God?

Yeah, I mean,
my parents raised me Evangelical,

and I hate them,
but I found my own way to it.

My own relationship.


I'd appreciate it
if you didn't advertise it, though.

I won't tell anybody. [chuckles]
I think it's kind of sweet.

Wanna make out?
Yeah, why not?

Can you not say "why not"?
It makes me feel like you don't want it.

It's shitty.

Sure, whatever.
That's better.

That's, you know, kinda scary.
Oh! Exactly.

It's unbelievable. It'sâ€¦

It's horrific and it'sâ€¦
And it's beautiful at the same time.

Oh, my God.
[laughing]

We've been trying to tell you.

We tried to tell you this whole time.
It's right there. It'sâ€¦

It's right there, Kate.

[horns honking]


I'm in Lansing, Michigan

Well, I'm in Illinois.
I could be ready by tomorrow.

[uneasy music continues playing]

There it is!



[bell dinging]

Go outside into your yard,
onto a roof, onto your sidewalk,

and just look up into the sky.

The star's gonna appear fuzzy.
It's got a long streak coming off of it.

That's the comet's tail.

<i>It's real and it's coming.</i>

<i>If anyone tells you any different,
they're full of shit.</i>

<i>Just look up into the sky.</i>

<i>It's a fucking fact.</i>

<i>- We have proof.
Just look up.</i>

<i>Guys, please just look up, okay?
Screw the manatees and just look up.</i>


[all] <i>Just look up!</i>

You tell your parents
that President Orlean and Isherwell

are sociopaths and fascists!

[cheers and applause]

And do you know why
they want you to look up?

Do you know why?

'Cause they want you to be afraid.

[audience cheering]

They want you to look up

because they are
looking down their noses at you.

<i>They think they're better than you.</i>

[chanting] <i>Don't look up!</i>

<i>They wanna rob you of your freedom,

[man yelling] <i>Just look up!</i>

<i>â€¦has not included India
or any other nation in the world</i>

<i>to be a part of this mission.</i>

<i>This dude is a known pornographer
named Kipâ€¦</i>

<i>Don't listen to that dumbfuck.</i>

<i>The United Nations have been
considering its own deflective mission.</i>

[laughing]
<i>- Just look up, for fuck's sake!</i>

is supporting the Just Look Up movement,

but I haven't seen a pin like that.

Yeah, this pin points both up and down.

Because I think, as a country,
we need to stop arguing

and virtue signaling. Just get along.

[woman] That is so refreshing.
Hmm.

we're all tired of the politics.

Yeah, yeah. Wellâ€¦

That's why we made <i>Total Devastation.</i>

It's for everyone. You know?
It's a popcorn movie.

You keep your eye on the road ahead,
you put your head down.

And you put
one foot in front of the other,

step by step.

[people cheering]


[people chanting] Don't look up!
Don't!

[captivating music playing]

So we wanna say something loud and clear.

There is no safe way
to bring this comet back to Earth

and exploit it for profit.
It cannot be done!

Nations of the world,
defy Orlean and BASH!

Launch your own nuclear deflection mission
now and save this planet!

[breathing heavily]

And now, uh, there's Riley Bina
with her special guest.

[people cheering]
I forgot the name. Thank you.

{\an8}["Just Look Up" playing]

{\an8}[Riley vocalizing]

<i>â™ª We knew no bounds
Fell at the speed of sound â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Riding against all odds but soon
Against ourselves â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You haunted every memory â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With no goodbyes out there for me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Your pride put out the fire
In our flame â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then just one look is all it takes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I feel your eyes
They're locked on every part of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And then my dumb heart says â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just look up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There is no place to hide â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª True love doesn't die â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It holds on tight
And never lets you goâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Is that a rock-solid tenÂ smokeshow
of a president or what?

[people cheering]

If she wasn't my motherâ€¦

There's three types of American people.

There are you, the working class.

Us, the cool rich, and then them.

[people booing]

I'm sorry, but we need them.

We need them because
you build us up to fight them.

The working class, the lower.

You understand?
No, I don't get it.

Do you understand? I'm talking aboutâ€¦

I'm talking about nutritionists.

I'm talking about personal trainers,

people at the spa,

but not the ones that check you in
and they're not the masseuses,

but they walk you down the corridor.

They're thereâ€¦

<i>â™ª Know I let you down
A nigga can't deny it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And there's so much that we're losin'
Yes, that matters â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've been dealin' with madness
Wasn't the man you needed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You dealin' with sadness
Truthfully, it's all on meâ€¦ â™ª</i>

[Oglethorpe] Divest from BASH when?
[people] Divest now!

Divest from BASH when?

<i>â™ª Time is oh so preciousâ€¦ â™ª</i>

We will not be quiet!

<i>â™ª Take my hand, baby
I'll never leave you, Riley â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Though what he's really trying to say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is get your head out of your ass â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Listen to the goddamn
Qualified scientists â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We really fucked it up
Fucked it up this time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's so close
I can feel the heat big-time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And you can act
Like everything is all right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But this is probably
Happening in real time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Celebrate or cry or pray â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whatever it takes
To get you through the mess that we made â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause tomorrow may never come â™ª</i>

[cell phone ringing]


Hey, good afternoon, Adam.
What do I owe the pleasure of this call?

What time?


Well, uhâ€¦ Well, thank you for calling.

Umâ€¦

Yeah.

[indistinct conversation]

What?

What?

Orlean and BASH
cut Russia, India, and China

out of the rights for the minerals.

So they tried their own
joint deflection mission,

but, uhâ€¦ approximately 40 minutes ago,

there was a massive explosion detected
at the Russian's Baikonur launch complex.

So it looks like the mission failed.

That's it?


What do you mean, "that's it?"

Teddy?

Right?

There is still the BASH mission.
It's all we have now.


["Just Like Paradise" playing on speakers]

[people cheering]

These Just Look Uppers

want millions of illegal Chileans
to come across the border.

[people chanting]

[all chanting] Don't look up.

The hell is that?

[people continue chanting]

Fucking lied to us.

The president just texted me.
[glass shattering]

"Don't trip. It's all good. Don't trip."
[people shouting and booing]

Hey, now.

You cut my face, you fucking rednecks!

[wind blowing]

a car in, like, an hour.

Everyone's watching the BASH launch.

What are we doing again?

I told you. We're, uhâ€¦
We're gonna go buy some groceries.

[song playing on radio]

[volume increases]

The Mills Brothers. Great band.
You know, Duke Ellington found this band.

I think they were originally called
the Four Kings of Harmony.

<i>â™ª We'll call on each memory
Till thenâ€¦ â™ª</i>

"Till Then," this is the song.
It's about, uhâ€¦

It's about soldiers
going off to World War II

and thinking about home.

Listen to this part.

<i>â™ª Although there are oceansâ€¦ â™ª</i>

"Although there are oceans we must cross
and mountains that we must climbâ€¦"

<i>â™ª I know every gainâ€¦ â™ª</i>

"I know that every gain must have a loss."

<i>â™ª So pray that our lossâ€¦ â™ª</i>

"So pray that our loss
is nothing but time."

<i>â™ª Till then, let's dream
Of what there will be â™ª</i>

[Yule] Okay, I gotta ask you something.
What?

Dr. Mindy, can I be vulnerable
in your car?


I've never met anyone like you

and I feel a connection to you
on a level thatâ€¦

I don't know,
I haven't felt with anyone else,

and going out on a limb,

but would you want to spend
more time together?

[song stops playing]
Maybe even get engaged or something?


Wow.
[Yule] Are you laughing?

No?
[Kate] I'm smiling.

Well, sure.
[Mindy] This is sweet.

Why not?
This is pretty sweet.


[Orlean hesitates] And you read
the tea leaves for Dr. Mindy.

You showed him the algorithm.
[Peter] Oh, yeah.

with that information.

How he was gonna die.
[Peter] Yeah, it is shaking.

It got me so excited
to know about my own death.

[both laughing]

I don't think I wanna know.
Yes, I do. I wanna to know.

You're gonna be eaten by a Bronteroc.
We don't know what it means.

A what?
A Bronteroc.

Oh.
Okay, people, we have clear skies.

[pensive music playing]

And we are a go for the BEAD launch.

Madam President?

Citizens of planet Earth. Nowâ€¦

Look at this, Kate. They have wild salmon.

Look at the difference between that
and the farm-raised stuff.

You see how that looks justâ€¦
I don't know. Looks fake, right?

Hey, why don't you go find some, uhâ€¦

What are the little potatoes called,
the tiny ones?

Fingerling potatoes?
Yeah.

I fucking love fingerling potatoes.
Let's get fingerâ€¦

Do you wanna say something too?

That was beautiful. Yeah.

What up, world? Jason Orlean,
uh, Chief of Staff, United States.

Umâ€¦

I've been noticing a lot of prayers
recently for people during this time

and I commend that, um,

but I also wanna give a prayer for stuff.

There's dope stuff, like material stuff,
like sick apartments and watches,

<i>and cars, um, and clothes and shit</i>

<i>that could all go away
and I don't wanna see that stuff go away.</i>

So I'm gonna say a prayer
for that stuff. Amen.

[man on TV] <i>Just a quiet trepidation</i>
<i>among this much smaller crowd.</i>

<i>I can hear the sounds
of some people praying.</i>


Yes, sir. Here we go, people.

Ten.

<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

<i>five, fourâ€¦</i>

[uneasy music playing]

[doorbell rings]

Hey.

Hi.

[flames roaring]

[dramatic music playing]

We, uh, got some groceries.

[dramatic music playing]

Yo, what was that?

We lost BEAD number 12.
[alarm blaring]


It's fine. It's fine.

We had anticipated a margin for error.

Everything is fine.

I was hoping
we could, um, have a family dinner.

[Evan and Marshall] Hey, Dad.

Hey, guys. Hey.
Hey.

What do you say?

Yeah.

[Mindy] Thank you.
Yeah.

This is, uhâ€¦ This is Kate.
Oh, hi.

Hello. Hi, Kate.
Let me grab those bags.

Nice to meet you. I'm Yule.
Yule.

I'm FirePuma142 on Twitch. You game?

It's really doubtful she knows.

You're right.
Who said I game?

Iâ€¦ I got these for you.

Thank you. That's really sweet, honey.

I'm so sorry. You have no idea.

I really am.
[sighs] I know. I know.

I've missed you.
I missed you so much.

When we dated in college,
I fucked Aaron Tran.

Oh?

Yeah, so, uhâ€¦

[Motown song playing on speakers]

[indistinct chatter]

That is really good.
Really good, right?

Hey, everybody.
Hey!

Sorry I'm late, but not empty-handed.
Hey, my friend.

Evan, Marshall, June,
this is Dr. Oglethorpe.

[indistinct chatter]

[dramatic music playing]

BEADs have approached
optimal escape velocity

and now approaching Comet Dibiasky
and are ready for attachment mode.

[crash on video]
[gasps]

[alarm blaring]
Uhâ€¦ Okay. All right.

Eight and 27 are lost
due to lateral control malfunction.

Okay, so, nowâ€¦ Now, Peterâ€¦

Peter, we're six drones down.
Is this thing still gonna work?

Well, the engineer's assured me
that yes, 24 drones is enough.

Well, how many can we lose?


[alarm blaring]

{\an8}<i>We're being told that several
of the BEADS have exploded on launch.</i>

Got the head seat right there.
[Oglethorpe chuckles]

You're way too kind, Randall. Thank you.


Do you want more wine?

Hey, cheers, everyone. Huh?
[Oglethorpe] Cheers.

Cheers.
[Mindy] Love you.

Love you.
Thank you so much for having us.

Thank you for being here.

It's so special.
Thank you.

[dramatic music playing]

Commence simultaneous
explosive separation stage now.

[gasps]
[alarm blaring]


[dramatic music playing]


[Mindy] Thank you, pal.
Yeah.

Yeah, it really is.
And it's really good to have you home.


Oh. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

That's right. Okay.
[laughter]

Yep, I was on, uh, magazine covers
and everything. I know.

[Kate] You looked great.
I'll take your shots.



[Mrs. Mindy] I love you.
Love you too.

[intense music playing]
All right. We need a report.

Need a full status report
on the explosive devices.

Get on it.
Still waiting for a full status report.

[cell phone ringing]
[gasps]


[breathing heavily] President Qi of China
says that the comet is still whole.

We got four misfires and sync was off.

It's still intact.


We've got four misfires
and the sync was off.

Okay. We're all fine. Everyone's fine.

It's gonna be all right.
If you'll excuse me. [chuckles]

Nature calls.

I'm just gonna go to the restroom
for a moment.

Yes, uh, I think
that I should also step out

to the restroom for a moment.

[alarm continues blaring]
[indistinct chatter]

[Jason] Should Iâ€¦
No, I'll be fine.

Sir, the president.

We need to know
what the mission status is.

She's coming right back.

Screw this. I'm going to see my husband.

[people clamoring]

I'm sorry. I've got a 20-year-old
daughter. I've got to go see her.



She's coming. She's coming back.

[people clamoring in panic]


In case we were wrong,
and clearly, we were wrong.

Of course you've got a ship.


It's state-of-the-art cryo-chambers,
and it's set to find

the nearest Earth-like planet
in a Goldilocks Zone soâ€¦

Hmm.

<i>There's room for you and one other.</i>

Brie, your wife, your call.

I'm good, but thank you for the offer.
You, uhâ€¦ You have fun with Jason.

Jason?

Oh, shit.

[alarm blaring]

She's coming back.

[uneasy music playing]

I'm thankful for that night
I fell asleep out in the backyard.

Woke up face-to-face with a baby deer.
I remember that.

Yeah.
Yep. It was the best day of my life.


I'm gratefulâ€¦


Man, oh, man, did we try.

Well, we're not the most religious here
in the Mindy household,

but, um, maybe we should say "amen"?
Should we do that?

[Mrs. Mindy] Don't look at me.

What, you just say, "Amen"? I don'tâ€¦

I got this.
Wrap it up?

I got it.

Dearest Father and Almighty Creatorâ€¦


â€¦we ask for Your grace tonight,
despite our pride.

Your forgiveness, despite our doubt.

Most of all, Lordâ€¦

We ask for Your love
to soothe us through these dark times.

May we face whatever is to comeâ€¦

[music continues playing]

<i>â€¦in Your divine will with courage
and open hearts of acceptance.</i>

Amen.
[Oglethorpe] Amen.

Wow. Youse got some church game.

That was beautiful.

{\an8}The comet remains intact.

{\an8}[people clamoring in panic]

We just neverâ€¦ [sighs]

Of course, there's only one story
everyone's talking about tonight.

<i>Topless urgent care centers.</i>

[people clamoring]



Orâ€¦ we can fuckâ€¦

[breathing heavily]

â€¦or pray, orâ€¦

Honestly, I think
I'd just rather drink andâ€¦

Talk shit about people.

[rapid gunfire]

You'll never take me alive!

Look out!

[dog barking]

[indistinct chatter on TV]

[grunting]
[woman screaming]

[people screaming]

[birds chirping]


[indistinct chatter]

I'm definitely gonna have
some more of this apple pie. It's so good.

It's actually store-bought,
but you really can't tell.

If I'm to be completely honest,
which at this moment, why not?

I actually like the junky taste
of store-bought better than homemade.

You gotta be kidding me.

No, I'm not kidding.

You know what? I know what he means.
It's like a childhood memory thing.

[piano music playing]

[people clamoring]


[music continues playing]

[electricity crackling]

Nothing is better than homemade, right?

This coffee doesn't taste
store-bought. Is it?

I grind my own beans. Yeah.

Yeah, Dad's kind of a coffee nut.

Every time you have coffee,
you have to grind your beans?

Randall is very particular
about his coffee.


[utensils clattering]

Thing of it is, we reallyâ€¦

We really did have everything, didn't we?

I mean, when you think about it.

[floor rumbling]

actually higher than on Earth

by nine percent,

so you might feel a bit light-headed.

And cryo-chambers were 58% successful,

which is much better than anticipated.

Yeah, we only had 47 dead
in our section, soâ€¦

I think this is gonna work out quite well.
Quite well, indeed.

Goodness.

I wonder, are those feathers
or are they scale...
