Dude get off me!

(SIREN WAILING)

(CHAINSAW REVVING)


(CROWD CHEERING)

Yesterday during the final, a guy
ran out to the field with the phrase,

"Natural Born Prankster"
written on his chest.

Nothing says "good clean fun" like
spending the night in a Brazilian prison.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
That just... Oh!

(ALL GIGGLING)

(PHONE RINGING)

(RINGING CONTINUES)

ROMAN: <i>Hey, what's up buddy?</i>

DENNIS: <i>It's snowing outside
man, not a whole lot.</i>

ROMAN: <i>Ugh! I know. I got some
good news, though. Call Vitaly.</i>

DENNIS: <i>All right, hold on.</i>

(PHONE RINGING)

VITALY: (SLEEPILY) <i>Hello?</i>
MAN 1: <i>Yo, V, you waking up at 2 p.m.? Come on.</i>

VITALY: <i>Two girls in my
bed, you know the deal.</i>

ROMAN: <i>Yeah, right. Listen, I got some good news.</i>
VITALY: <i>What?</i>

ROMAN: <i>We're making a movie. The guy
called, he wants to make the movie.</i>

VITALY: <i>A porn movie?</i>
ROMAN: <i>Not a porn...</i>

<i>Like an actual movie, a prank movie.</i>

<i>Get rid of them chicks,
we're bringing the dicks.</i>

BIG BOY: <i>Real 92.3, LA's hip hop
and R&B, it's your partner Big Boy,</i>

<i>the voice of Los Angeles,
matter of fact, LA.</i>

<i>We looking at some beautiful
weather man, it's gonna be sunny.</i>

<i>But let me tell you all, those boys
from Ohio and that crazy ass Russian,</i>

<i>they are on their
way to Los Angeles.</i>

<i>So, with that being
said, watch your back.</i>

<i>You have been warned.</i>

All right, so here we go. So, at 8:00,
you're gonna have your first person here.

We expect all these people to be prompt.

They've been told that
the person who lives here,

John, which is each one of you.

So we're John every time?
You're John every time.

You don't really know me.

Your boss lined this up. Your
boss can be an agent, a manager.

You guys can be yourselves if you want.

So, hopefully these people will be
on time. Thanks a lot for coming by.

My normal girl's out of town.
Cool.

What do we do for a living?
I'm all jammed up.

Whatever you want. That's where you can improv.
VITALY: Okay.

Oh, it looks so good.

Okay, go.


How does that work?
CLAPPER: Boner prank, take one.

VITALY: <i>Can you hold it with your
legs and kind of let it go later?</i>

Can you, like, put your
legs together and hold it?

Oh, she's here. She's here.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

Hey, she's hot.

Oh, hi. How are you?
Hi. Good. How are you?

I'm John.
Nicole.

Nice to meet you. Thank
you so much for coming.

Oh! I've just been so tight.

ROMAN: Do you do a lot of massages or...
Mmm-hmm.

That's all you do?
Yeah.

ROMAN: Ah, that's perfect.

Just the right amount of friction, too.

No way!
She's looking at it?

Yeah, look.

How long have you been doing this?
About five years.

Oh my God. You smell so good.

Thanks.
Oh, my God!


Oh, my God!

ROMAN: (SOFTLY) Oh, yeah!

(BOTH LAUGHING)


(ROMAN MOANING)


ROMAN: What's up?
Nothing.

Yeah, just a little
faster and harder, please.



A little excited?

Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

Oh, my God.
(LAUGHS)

Is this... This is normal, right?

Um... No... Uh...

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(DOORBELL RINGS)

DENNIS: Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot. Motherfucker.

I'll go grab him for you.

Hey!
Hey. How are you?

What up?
John.

You're John, I'm Bob.
John.

Bob? Bobby.
Yeah.

Yeah.
VITALY: Where you from?

Topanga Canyon.

Where? From Nigeria?

No, Topanga Canyon. (CHUCKLES)
Oh.

We're good.
BOB: What kind of work do you do?

I'm a music producer.

Are you?
I do beats.

Yeah.
BOB: Wow.

How often do you get treatments?

Usually like, once a week.
Uh-huh.

But usually by a female, never a male.

Well...
But I heard male hands are nicer and stronger

and they can really, you know,
do what needs to be done. You...

I usually work exclusively on women, but...
Oh!

I don't mind working on you, and...

Wow, you've got a hot body. (LAUGHS)

You take off your shirt. That's awesome.
I'm 62.

62? You look great.

What the fuck?

VITALY: <i>Whoo!</i>

I love it. You energize.

(MOANS)
Yeah.

I'm an energy kinda worker, too.
Oh, yeah.


Are you uncomfortable? You look a little bit.
Not at all.

Let's make some eye contact.
Okay, sure.

I have no problem with that.
All right.

my arms out like that. Keep going.

You can do whatever you want, man.

Just keep going.
I'll work around it.

I never had somebody touch me like that.

That's cool.
(MOANS)

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Sorry about that.


VITALY: You can take your jeans off.

If you're cool with that.

We're in the house, dude. Just
jeans off if you're fine with that.

You know, I would feel more comfortable

if you take your jeans off.
Really?

(ALL LAUGHING)

(BOTH LAUGH)

VITALY: Oh, great!


What was that?

Oh, I'm just talking about my job.

I almost got fired today.

Wow. That's tough being, you know, in
a position where you might get fired.

Let me see your butt.

(BOTH LAUGH)

VITALY: So, how many...

How many males did you ever have sex with?

None.
Really?

BOB: Yeah.
VITALY: Oh, wow.

I'm not...
What if I just give you one kiss?

Whoa, my boner's going crazy.

(VITALY MOANING)

(MOANING CONTINUES)


Fuck!

(CLAPPING)
What's this?

DENNIS: Hey, welcome
to Tailpipe Dreams, man.

Tell the camera your name and
what kind of car do you have?

My name is Joey Alcazar.

JOEY: I have a 1958 Chevy Del Ray.

My name's Angel Antunez.
They call me Bullet.

ANGEL: My car, Primeros,
'68 Chevy Impala convertible.

DENNIS: And why do they call you Bullet?

You don't want to know.

Robert Salinas, AKA Hollywood.

ROBERT: I have a 1964 Cadillac convertible.

DENNIS: And so, how long
have you had this Cadillac?

I probably had it about 15 years.

Well dude, it matches you.

Yeah.
It's like a good match.

That's why they call me Mr. Hollywood.
(ALL LAUGH)

DENNIS: Ah, that's good, man. So,
what do you enjoy about your car?

What do you love to do with your car?

You know, I just got into the
Uso Car Club a couple years ago.

ROBERT: We just love the family
that we build in, you know?

And you know, when we see each other,
it's like we've known each other for years.

DENNIS: Hey! Wait. Hey! Are
those guys with you right there?

Hey!
Hey!

Hey we need to get attention
to this... Robert's car here.

We got some people. Maybe
we gotta call the cops.

ROBERT: What are you doing, bro?
VITALY: What's that?

What are you doing to my car?
Getting gas.

Wait, you're getting
fucking gas out of my car?

VITALY: Yeah.
What are you doing that for?

Because...
'Cause why?

What are you doing?
I know this looks bad, bro.

I know it looks bad.
Chill. Relax. Why would you do that?

Get the fuck off my car.
Mr. Holly...

Get the fuck away from my car!

Get the fuck off my car!

VITALY: Relax... Relax!

Get the fuck off my car.
VITALY: What am I...

Get out of my car!
Relax! Let me get my gas.

Get... Get...
Let me get my gas.

You motherfuckers!

Relax.
Okay, we...

If you would ask for fucking
money, I will give you money!

Don't touch people's fucking car!

Give me a kiss.
What's your name, bro?

See, why do you have to be a punk?

In Russia, we give kiss to
each other to say goodbye.

Get the fuck out of here!

ROBERT: Do you want your ass kicked?
For what?

DENNIS: Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
What's your problem?

Let's get the cop, we'll get
the police coming, Robert!

Why you talking shit, motherfucker?

Come on, motherfucker!

Come on, motherfucker!

Come on, motherfucker! You
want to fuck with me? Let's go!

Just one gallon, bro, one
gallon. One gallon for my moped.

One gallon for my moped.

Okay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving.


Don't hit me with a belt.

Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

Come on, bro.
Please.

He doesn't want to talk.
I just wanted his name.

Please, don't do it. Don't whoop me.

DENNIS: Hey, hey, hey.
MAN: We're shooting a movie. We got cameras all over.

Robert, Robert. Hey, you're
being pranked right now.

VITALY: You've been set
up, bro. You've been set up.

My friend, it's just a joke, my friend.
DENNIS: It's just a joke.

VITALY: It's just a joke.
Everyone's in on it, brother.

VITALY: Your buddy set you up, bro.

VITALY: We didn't scratch your car...

(ALL LAUGHING)

We couldn't even take
your fuckin' gas cap off.

Why are you fucking doing that
to me? You guys are assholes.

(ALL CHEERING)

Nice job.
Why? Why?

ROBERT: Why, people? Why? You made
me come all the way for this shit?

Hey guys. Today we're on
Miami Beach with Vitaly.

We brought our friend here. (LAUGHS)

(BOTH SCREAM)

(WOMEN SCREAMING)



(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
VITALY: Watch it. Hey.

(TASER BUZZING)
(VITALY LAUGHS)

VITALY: Oh, my God.

Wow.

Oh, asshole!

I'm gonna go get that taser.

ROMAN: The idea is we bring somebody
in, maybe a guy off the street,

and we're going to make him believe
we're shooting an independent film.

We're gonna be playing a camera crew...
MAN: What's my part in the bit,

I'm getting robbed and I don't know...

ROMAN: You're getting robbed
for real and you don't know.

ROMAN: Hey, you wanna
learn how to act? All right.

When he pulls up, you're a sound guy. Okay?

Okay? Play the part.

You're a camera guy.
VITALY: I'm a fucking audio guy.

(VITALY EXCLAIMS)

ROMAN: Stop it, bro. Come on. Be a human.

MAN: Hey, they're pulling in right
now, so be professional, please.

VITALY: Who's the girl? Oh, God.

Hi. How are you?
WOMAN: Hi. Great.

ROMAN: Great? Good.
WOMAN: Yes.

ROMAN: So, because we have
a short amount of time,

let me just run you
through what we're gonna do.

And let's have fun with it. So
we got a very small crew here.

We're gonna have just a mic and a
camera, and we're gonna run you through.

We actually have our own register here.

You're gonna come through the
door just like a robber would.

You're gonna look around, sneak
around, maybe see what's up.

And stay in this area, and
you're gonna rob the cashier.

WOMAN: Okay.
All right?

We're gonna have a guy here.
He's not gonna give you the money.

You gotta get the money.

I gotta get the money.
Yeah.

Yeah, let's rehearse.
Go ahead and step out.

All right, let's start over here.
Right here, get on your mark.

Dennis, you're gonna be behind her.

Okay, the cashier is
here. Now, listen to me.

Let's get the money and get out. All right?
Okay.

You ready? Camera's rolling?

Audio? Roll sound. Action.

Give me the fucking money right now.
What the fuck? Ma...

Shut the fuck up and give me the fucking money.
Ma! What the fuck? Ma!

Shut the fuck up!
Oh, shit!

Shut up! And give me the fucking money!
Okay! Fuck, I got a daughter.

Stand up or else I'll fucking shoot you!

Okay! Okay! I'm unarmed!
Fucking moron!

Get the fuck up!
Okay, okay!

Okay! Fuck!
Hurry the fuck up!

Just don't shoot!
You know what? Give me all that shit!

Shut the fuck up! I will blow your brains.

Don't kill me. I just want
to go home to my daughter.

Fuck all that!

Just don't kill me! Oh, shit!
Give me the fucking money!

Don't kill me please.


WOMAN: Shut the fuck up.

Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

OFFICER 1: Get down, get down. Drop the gun.
Ahhh!

Drop the gun! Drop the gun now!

Now get on the ground!

Get on the ground.
CASHIER: I'm not armed.

Is this a joke?
BOTH: Turn around!

Do I look like I'm joking?

Put the bag down! Put the bag down!
Put the bag down!

I'm with the film crew!

BOTH: What film crew?

OFFICER 2: We got a silent alarm.

They sent me... I swear to God. I...

OFFICER 1: Put your hands over your head!

Is this a joke?
I'll cuff her.

Oh, my God!
Get your hands over your head!

Put your hands on top of...
CASHIER: Officer? Can I come out?

Yes, come on out.

They set me up.

OFFICER 1: Sure they did.

Oh, my God!
We'll get your purse.

Stand up.
You'll get your purse at the police station.

I swear to God!

We'll clear this all up at the police station.
Are you serious?

WOMAN: Wait, what...

Is this? Wait a minute.
Bend over the car.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, my God!

Oh, my fucking God!

They set me up!

Oh, my God!

You scared the shit out of me!


(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

Excuse me, sir.

We're doing inspection today, seeing
if you're wearing any underwear.

Would you mind pulling
those pants down for me

and see what kind of
underwear you're wearing?

What's up? What did you say?
You called me an asshole?

No, I'm calling...
Why would you call me an asshole?

I... I never do that.
Come here.

He called me an asshole.


Why would you call him a name like that?
I never do, sir.

Yeah, you do.
You don't know.

You have a gun.
Well...

You are a cop.

I am?
Will you stop messing with... Is he a cop?

If he looks like a cop, I'd say he's a cop.

All right, 'cause he's playing with me.
Smells like a cop.

Ma'am have you been drinking?

Yeah.
Yeah? I thought so.

You got that look.

Hey, you got a little spider
on your shoulder there.

It's going around the back, here.
Oh, my God!

Hey, you sexy motherfucka!

Hey, buddy.

Hey guys, how you doing?
Welcome to Hooters.

Can I get you something cold to
drink, a soft drink? We got a full bar.

Okay. We'll make that happen.

So we're in Burbank. It's
absolutely beautiful here.

We're about to pull a
prank with these guys.


Little babies. Look at the
cute little babies. Look at 'em.

This is called people who eavesdrop.

This is kind of a prank on people
who eavesdrop on conversations.

Basically, this prank is, we try
to make people shit their pants.

That's really the goal here.

Hello, it's Tom.

There we go.

I'm sorry... Dude, if
you're gonna scream...

I... I can't... I can't hear you talk...

Husband?

Dude, she didn't say
anything about being married.

Be mad at her, dude!

She did not say nothing
about being married.

Oh, he's listening. He's listening.

You want some of this? Dude...

Bring your buddies.

<i>Dude, I did not have sex with
her! I don't even know her!</i>

I'm across the street. I'm at the bus stop.

I'm wearing a flannel shirt. I think I'm
ready to get on the bus right now. Come on.

Yeah.

Fuck.

Does he get on the bus?
VITALY: Yeah.

DENNIS: <i>Damn.</i>
ROMAN: <i>Oh!</i>

DENNIS: (ON WALKIE) <i>Hey,

<i>You got a good practice run
there. Looked great on camera.</i>

So, let's go ahead and
just wait for another mark.

Oh, shit, he's back off! He's back off!

ROMAN: <i>Yo, Tom. He came back out.</i>

He's still there. Keep
going. Walk away, walk away.

Send him in.
Send 'em. Send 'em.

Hard. send him hard.

That's that motherfucker right there.

That's that motherfucker right there.

Oh, shit!
(LAUGHS)

Hey man. Come on over here I

Step... Just step right here.

Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.
Oh, look at that.

So, you sleepin' with my wife.

No, that was the other
guy. He's back up there.

Back up? What you mean "the other guy?"

What other guy?

He's in the blue shirt down
there. He was yelling on the phone.

And so you're not... You

No. It's not me. It's not me.
What do you mean, it's not you?

It's not me!

Oh, he's scared.
MAN: <i>Give me your phone!</i>

Look, it's not me. See? This is my

That's me and my boyfriend right here.

That's bullshit!
He ain't gay.

That's bullshit.
That's me and my boyfriend right there.

So what y'all think I should do to him?

What you all think I
should do to this dude?

<i>I was standing right next to the
guy when he was on the phone.</i>

He was screaming...
So how do you know who this dude is?

I heard, I was standing right next to him

when he was yelling at
someone on the phone.

I think you're lying! I think you're lying!
I'm not lying.

I'm not lying.
So you're lying to me. You're fucking my girl...

(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God.

No. I have a boyfriend. I'm gay.
You're gay?

I have no interest in girls whatsoever.

You know what? Give me your phone.

Give me your phone or
I'm gonna fuck you up.

ROMAN: Yo, yo, yo. You're being pranked.

(ALL LAUGHING)
Oh!

(ALL CLAPPING)

I was about ready to sign
my own death certificate.

ROMAN: You killed it, Tom.
VITALY: He's gay.

Come here, man.

I want to apologize to this guy right here.

Such a good sport.
I'm sorry, man.

One take, huh? One take.

ROMAN: Nice job, Tommy. You the man, bro.
Thank you. Thank you.

TOM: (LAUGHS) <i>That was
good. Oh, that was funny</i>

(SIREN WAILING)

We have a nine month pregnant... Yvonne.

Probably one of the
craziest women I've ever met.

Her husband doesn't know she's
about to give birth to a black baby.


(PHONE RINGING)

GEORGE: (ON PHONE) <i>Hey we're about to
finish up in about five, ten minutes.</i>

<i>Can I call you back?</i>

I think, I... I'm having some contractions.

I think you might want to
just start coming home now.

<i>Really?</i>
Yeah.

Okay, good. I'll see you soon.

<i>Okay.</i>
All right. Bye.

VITALY: Dude, the poor guy!

(BABY COOING)
DENNIS: I... Oh, man.

ROMAN: He's coming in.
MAN: Here he comes. He's coming.

Guys, he's pulling up right now.

He's pulling up. Oh, man.

Yvonne, you did a wonderful job.

The baby looks very healthy.
YVONNE: Oh.

Oh, shit.

DENNIS: <i>Hello.</i>
GEORGE: <i>Hello. Hi.</i>

Is this Jukka?
This is my husband, George.

Congratulations, George.

Congratulations. Yvonne had a very
healthy pregnancy, everything was great.

We're gonna prepare her for transport.
(BABY COOING)

Oh, my God! Look at his face!
MAN: Go tight in on his face.

Oh, no!

Um... It...
(BABY COOS)

Let's give him a minute to talk.

Guys, get out of there.
Let him have a minute.

DENNIS: <i>Excuse me, sir. We're
gonna prepare for transport.</i>

And we'll be we'll be right
back. One second, okay?

(BABY COOS)

I was meaning to talk to you, but...

It's...

You gotta say something.

He's in shock. In shock.

Is this our baby?

I...

Go, Will, go.
WILL: Yeah.

DENNIS: Okay, guys, are you
ready to go for transport?

Do you want to help carry her out?

You don't want to hug your baby?

Eve, Eve.

MAN: Oh.
Oh.

I just got the... I just
got the text. Is she okay?

Oh, shit!

Yeah. She's doing great.
Oh, my God.

She looks amazing.
This, this, this is Will.

George?
Oh, shit!


I'm so glad I could
facilitate this for you guys.

I am blessed to be a part of this.

Congratulations, guys.
Oh, my God.

She's so beautiful. She's healthy.

Wait, what's going on?

Oh.

George, please. Congratulations, man.

We're gonna raise a family together.

ROMAN: <i>Oh, my God!</i>
Congratulations.

Congratulations. It's wonderful.

Thank you. Thank you, guys.

Beautiful baby.
You look amazing.

Oh, you look so beautiful.
Thank you.

Congratulations.
Kiss the baby.

Wow! Oh, my God.

Look at this poor guy, dude. This is...

This is like watching
someone get beat with a bat.

So we're gonna go ahead,
prepare for transport.

You wanna ride,

follow us in the ambulance?

Maybe you, you two can
catch a ride together, maybe.

ROMAN: <i>Well, let him speak.
He's trying to say something.</i>

Can we all go together?

Oh, my God, dude!

Oh, my God! Bro, he's taking a picture.

Ask the dad to take a picture.

Ask him to get in for the photo.

You wanna come in on this, sir?

Are you okay? Is there something wrong?

Can you get in with the photo or...

What's going on?
Hey, you guys look beautiful.

Yvonne... Yvonne did a wonderful job.

Come on, get in here. You're having a baby.

I mean this is... (CHUCKLES) This is it.

Guys, can we leave him and
his wife alone, by himself?

Take the baby in the back
room and just leave them alone.

Ah, let me see.
Okay.

Let me go ahead and do a couple tests real quick...
Yeah, no problem.

WILL: Can I... Can I stay with the baby?

Oh no, one second.
No, you got one moment.


I'm sorry.

What's wrong?

Is this how George reacts
usually to situations?

How...

I've been delivering mail here
for four years now. (CHUCKLES)

When I found out that you guys may
have a problem conceiving, I was...

Ecstatic to help.


How... Wait.

It's okay.

Wait, don't...

MAN: Hold on.
Uh-oh.

Are you okay?
Did you not tell him?

No. I was going to.
You didn't tell him?

You didn't tell him?

YVONNE: But the baby came sooner...
No.

When I came over and had tea
all those times and everything...

Every day I've come... You didn't tell him?

You thought... I thought you
said he was happy about it?

This is so good.

Wait, when? When did you have tea?

When did you have tea?

Often.

Let's reveal.

It's your baby now.

My part's done.

No, dude. You are not the father.


Oh, my God!

GEORGE: She's a beautiful baby.

MAN: Oh!
(ALL LAUGHING)

The first thing he can say!

WILL: Oh, my God, I'm so... He speaks!

Nice meeting you.

Yeah. You as well.

Thanks. Sorry about today.
Well played.

You're both jerks.

ROMAN: We'll take that.
Yeah. So... Natural Born Pranksters.

Can you take our picture for me?

I just want to take a snapshot.
Just a snapshot over here.

(WOMAN SCREAMING)
(DENNIS SCREAMING)

Hey man, what's up, guys?
I just want to say nice car.

(MAN IN CAR) Thanks.
Yeah. Hey can you do me a quick favor?

Tell me if this stinks.


(INDISTINCT TALKING)

guy on Mario... The Mario game.

Remember that game, like on N64?

Like when you're playing, you see that
little turtle flying around with the camera?

That's you, dude.

Yeah, this and then the two...

The two chili dogs from last

DENNIS: Dude, your...
So we're gonna have two canvases out there.

If you guys have to barf, make
sure you barf on the canvas.


We gonna paint?

All right.





Hi. Hi.

My name is Joseph. I'm the lucky one

who gets to be presenting to
you some of this beautiful art,

and we are honored to
have some guests with us.

You haven't met them yet. This is Rome.

ROME: Hi. Nice to meet you.

This is Art.

And this is Dan, and Dan

where are you from?

Turkey.
Turkey.

And they are part of a group of artists
that I have decided to represent.

The main artist who, who could not
be here, is working on his next piece.

He finds inside of himself something,
that I think, most artists just throw away.

They discard, they don't
think about it as art.

I think he finds it to be
something that you can create,

and you can find within yourself also.


Did everybody get a ticket tonight?

Everybody got a blue ticket,
correct? Did everybody get one?

Everybody's good, right?
Somebody's gonna be a lucky winner tonight.

You are gonna get to win
this piece of art right here.

I hope I don't see it on eBay.


Now let's remember that
the last two pieces of art,

one went for $18,000 to a man from France.

(CROWD GASPS)
And the other piece went for $27,000

to a collector up in Northridge.

Okay?

This piece here is beyond
those pieces, beyond.

Okay, so...

Whoo. Let's see who's gonna be
the lucky winner tonight. Okay?

(CROWD APPLAUDING)

That's it. Let's hear it.

Um...

Let me get one from the bottom.

The lucky winner of tonight's painting

is number 519

096.

Right here.

Are you serious?
(CROWD CHEERING)

You're so lucky. You are so lucky.

So amazing.

This piece of art, it's different,

it's new, it's original.


Okay.

CROWD: Oh, wow.

ROMAN: Thank you.
ANNOUNCER: Don't be afraid of different.

This is real art.

WINNER: What's that smell?
I want to show you how this art is created.

We have a video of our artist,

working on this particular piece.

Okay, everybody. Watch.

DAVE: <i>My art comes from
a place deep inside me.</i>

<i>A blank canvas so full of potential,</i>

<i>there to receive my paint</i>

<i>and my brush strokes.</i>

<i>Through my art,</i>

<i>I express myself.</i>

<i>My art is all of me.</i>

<i>All of my soul explodes
onto that canvas.</i>

<i>In that sense,</i>

<i>I am my art.</i>

(CROWD GROANS AND LAUGHS)

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

ROMAN: We just love what we do.

Please take the painting.

Take the painting.
No, no, no.

Please take it.
WINNER: Listen to me.

Don't let Fluffy fool you up in here.

ROMAN: Maybe this video
will change your mind.

VITALY: Maybe this video
will change your mind.

This is how we actually made the painting.

This is the actual painting
we're giving you. Poo-tella.

(LAUGHS)
That's right, poo-tella.

All right.

Ta-da.

VITALY: It's a piece of shit.

VITALY: That cup's full
of, like, liquid smell.

It's black goo mixed with Styrofoam.

Ah, buddy, I hope it's not flammable.

MAN: All right, so, what time
is Vitaly's mom getting here?

Yo, she should be here any
minute. Why, are we closing this?

ROMAN: Yeah, let's...
Let's hang out. She should be here, five minutes.

MAN: Yo, you better get her a
kick-ass mother's day gift this year.

When is mother's day?
I don't know.

It's in May, but you're gonna have to
really go heavy on the gift this year.

Nah, she doesn't even care, dude.

VITALY: This is it, bro.
Magic. Please go off.

VITALY: What's up, beautiful?
Finally. Looking good.

VITALY: I love your hair.

Oh, no!

No! Vitaly! Stop!
(LAUGHING)

Oh, no!



VITALY: (LAUGHS) I'm sorry.
You're a fucking asshole!

I'm sorry. I love you.

I don't love you anymore.

MAN: (LAUGHING) Trade

Argh! I feel disgusting!

Hey...

DENNIS: Karma's a bitch!

WOMAN: I don't know. I

ROMAN: Hey!
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

(DOGS HOWLING)

MAN: You guys can both get in the back.

Have you guys been hiking up here before?

No.
Whoo!

Let's go. This is gonna be so...

You ever been on an
adventure like this before?

WOMAN 1: No, I... No. I
don't go at night. It's scary.

MAN: Hey man, we're just
pulling down Crystal Springs,

I think. Am I meeting you at
that same trail we were at before?

MAN: Okay.
WOMAN 1: Are we gonna see some deers? I love deers.

MAN: I saw two coyotes
on the way down here.

WOMAN 2: What! Well, you know with
my big ass, I can't run or nothing.

WOMAN 2: Why in the hell did
I let you talk me into this?

WOMAN 2: You know black people don't
be going hiking at night in the woods.


MAN: The last time we were at this other
little trail, somewhere right around here...

MAN: So, where's...

(CAR ALARM BLARING)

WOMAN 2: What the fuck is going on?

MAN: We're filming a movie.

This is some bullshit.
(LAUGHING)

WOMAN 2: Oh, my God. I pissed on myself!

(LAUGHING AND CHEERING)


See, see, I was trying to do the right
thing and get healthy and go hiking.

This is why big people should not hike!

Big people stay your big ass home and eat!
(LAUGHING)

And don't go to no damn mountains!
(LAUGHING)

Go swimming at the gym or something!
(LAUGHING)

Fuck this hiking shit!


MAN: Whoo!

What's up, guys. Today we're with
Furrious... Okay. (CLEARING THROAT)

MAN: You said, "Furrious." It's Furious.
(MIMICKING VITALY)

What's up, guys. Today we're
with Furious Pete. (LAUGHS)

MAN: Go!

My name's Peter Czerwinski. And I
am a professional competitive eater.

(WOMAN LAUGHING)


We're gonna do an eating contest.

(IMITATING A SEAL)

MAN: And whoever finishes first
hits the button in the middle,

and those who have not finished
get their plates cleaned for them.

And it's literally as simple as that.

I don't want to do this shit.
Oh, I'm sorry.

(LAUGHS)
I don't either, to be honest.

To be honest, I don't want to
do it either, but, you know...

MAN: All right, let's go, let's go.

(BOTH VITALY AND DENNIS) What the fuck is that?
(LAUGHING)

DENNIS: What is that?

ROMAN AND DENNIS: Well,

Oh, Pete! You're the man, dude!


You still have that one. You still got one!
Nah, I got fuck all!

Ahhh! You, fuck you!

(CLAPPING)

Was that worth it?

(CRASH)
(LAUGHING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Hi!
Are you serious?

Some tanning, my friend. Tan, tan.
(LAUGHS)

Yo, whatever you do, don't
go for the full 30 minutes.

ROMAN: He just looks like a Miami club owner.
VITALY: Yeah, yeah.

ROMAN: (LAUGHING) Dirty dude.
(LAUGHS)

What's your name?
Gilbert.

Gilbert?
Yeah.

Hello everybody. My name is Gilbert.

Au revoir, I am Francis.

And today, we're promoting
a new tanning bed.

And it might be a little burning man tanning bed.
(LAUGHING)

Oh, are you okay?

It's so... It's so... Argh, it's so hot!
He's okay. He's okay.

That's our new tanning bed.
(ROMAN WAILING)

VITALY: Welcome, mademoiselle.
There's my manager over there.

Oh, good afternoon.

Where are you from?

I am from... French. How 'bout you?
WOMAN: (LAUGHS) French?

So what are you here for, ladies?

I'm here for a tan because I'm so white.

Come, let's see.

Oh, yeah, yeah...
She's negative 35.

This is my darkest.

You are more like negative 22.

So tan. You're gonna be so tan.

So tan?
So which... Which tan do you want?

Do you want a... Is this
the tan? The sexiest tan

or do you want this tan, the okay tan?

I like your tan a little bit better only because...
VITALY: I'm too dark?

(BOTH WOMEN) Yes.
Are you calling me black?

It looks a little fake.
No. I just think you're a little too dark.

Okay, so let me tell you
something very exciting today.

Today, we got our new machine from USSR.

It was discovered in
2014, which is last year,

and if you minus 2015 minus 2014,

that's one year, correct?

Correct. So today, it's fair to say the machine is safe.
Look how he's selling.

This is very new.

I suggest... You try it first time.

To $9.99, you like, you
buy package $150 for ten.

We got somebody in there.
You will be second and third.

(SCREAMING)
Or you can do same time.

MAN: Ow! Ow!

Hello?
(SCREAMING)

Monsieur! Monsieur?
VITALY: Are you okay, sir?


Sorry, it's our...



(CRYING)
VITALY: Call 9-1-1.

ROMAN: Please help!
VITALY: Francis!

Would you like to do the session?



You should
call 9-1-1 now!


WOMAN: No, no, no...
Please...

No, your friend is staying
here. You're coming with me.

You're coming, it's free.

What the fuck! Don't go with him!

It's free. It's free. It's okay.
No!

Get under.

Just stop!
Don't go in there!

It's 99 cents and she can afford it.
What the fuck? 99 cents?

It at least costs three grand.

This guy is never gonna
frickin' be the same!

(SCREAMING)
What the hell are you doing?

ROMAN: (SCREAMING) Get it off!

WOMAN: No, no, no.

VITALY: No, please. Please, come
here. Come here. You need a tan.

VITALY: What about a happy ending?

DENNIS: Oh, man.


DENNIS: Excuse me, ma'am. Hey, you think
you can just take a video for me for my...

In front of my girlfriend's car for me?
Yeah.

Okay, cool. Here, just
stand right here for me.

Okay.
And just let me put it on video.

Then just hit record.

Is it recording?
Yes.

Does it look good?
Yes.

WOMAN: Go for it.

Hey Stephanie. I just want
to say I love you so much.

And I'm so happy for the
time that we had together

and I can't imagine
being with anybody else.

And I can't imagine you being
with somebody else, either.

And that's why I can't believe that
you would do this to me, because...

DENNIS: We've been through so much
together, and we have this kid,

and this... It's what you've done to me...

It's like it doesn't even
hurt me, it hurts our family.

And I know you're here in
North Hollywood Park right now

with your boyfriend or whoever
the hell he is right now,

and...


You can't be with him.

You can't be with anybody.

(GLASS SHATTERING)
(CRYING)

DENNIS: So you're not gonna be with shit.

DENNIS: You're not gonna be with anybody.

So I'm gonna fucking take your laptop,

and fuck that.

Right? And you're gonna cheat on me.

You have your boyfriend's wallet.


(CAR ALARM BLARING)
You fuckin' betrayed me!

You betrayed me.

DENNIS: You betrayed our fucking family!

DENNIS: I can't... Wait a minute.
(CAR ALARM BEEPING)

Oh, my God. That's not her car.

Hold on. Oh, my God. That's not
her car. Wait, it's this car.

Here, I need to do that
video again. No, no, no, no.

I need you to do my video again, please.
I'm sorry.

I need you to take a video. Again.
I can't.

(CAR ALARM CONTINUES)

Excuse me, boss. Can you help me out?

My car... I locked my keys in the car.

Excuse me, man. Yo.

Can you give me a hand?

I locked my keys in my car.

Excuse me, man. I locked my
car key. Can you help me in?

No.

Yo, excuse me, my man. Can
you guys help me unlock my car?

I'll give you $100 bucks.

I'll help you out, but you ain't
gotta give me no money, man.

Why would I not give you money?
It's cool, man.

I don't need money.
Oh, man, you're a nice person.

Thanks, dude. I get it in there, but...

What do you need me to do?
Just unlock my car.

You left your keys in there?
Yeah.

MAN: Just give me a minute, mom.

WOMAN: You have AAA?

Yeah, I'm gonna try to make a phone call.

All right, I'm gonna take care
of it from now on. Thanks, dude.

I got the picture.

Picture of what?
I got, I got a picture of that.

It's not my car. Thanks, dude.

Call the police now. Excuse me.

He tried to accuse him of stealing the
car, you know, after asking for help.

Hey! No!

Hey! Hey!

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Thanks, dude!

Okay, no. It's a movie. It's a movie.

Yo! Chill. Chill. No, no, no, no.
(DOG BARKING)

(WOMAN SHOUTING)

Relax. No. No, it's a... It's a movie.

Yo, she's gonna put the dog on me!

VITALY: Yo, guys it's a show.

VITALY: She was about
to let her pitbull on me.

MAN: Whoo!

Here. You want to start the car?

VITALY: I can go now?
Yeah.

VITALY: Hmm?
(BUZZING)

Oh!

Tim,
9-1-1.

MAN: So broad strokes of this prank...

You're getting picked up and
getting taken to our location.

You're in the backseat. You
tell him he has to take a detour.

So, we're gonna give him
a bogus address at first...

Yeah.
Right? We'll start headed that way.

Change of plans, I need
you to come to this address.

And these guys know, or no?

These guys are...
Do they have any idea?

They think they're PAs for something else.
All right.

VITALY: Can you put the windows down?

Oh, yeah. Right here,
right here, right here.

Yo!

VITALY: Usually we don't even
come inside. He just walks in.

MAN: Roger that.

Listen, dude. Be quick. Quick.

What's up?

MAN 1: Shut the car off. Give me your keys.

VITALY: Damn.

You're late.
What's up, guys? What do you mean, late?

It's not my first time here.
You're late!

I don't think I met you
before. What's your name?

Assassin.
Nice to meet you.

He comes here all the time.

Great, how are you?

What's up?
What's up?

So, I'm going to Vegas this weekend, and...

Hmm.
I'm gonna go for my buddy's birthday, 21st birthday.

Vegas.

So, I stopped by for some goodies, if
you know what I mean. Some party favors.

VITALY: I need 15 grams this time.

15 grams.
15 grams.

Half now, half later. I'll pay
you after I come back in Vegas.

What?
VITALY: Only half with the cash.

You gotta be kidding, homes.

VITALY: I can pay... Dude, you know
my address, you know where I live,

you have my phone number.
MAN: All right.

All right.
We'll take care of you. Come on.

Let's ask him.

Who's your driver?
Uh...

He's... Yeah, don't worry
about him. He's cool. He's new.

He's good.

Where the fuck is he going?

MAN 1: So, when are you
guys going to Vegas again?

VITALY: We're going this Friday.

VITALY: So yeah.

MAN 2: That's it?

VITALY: I told you. You're really
gonna take my money like that?

MAN 1: Dude, we said half, yo!

Take the shit out of
your pockets right now!

Tell them we didn't see nothing, man.

I'm pulling all your fucking
clothes off in case you're a cop!

I'm not a cop!
Shut up!

MAN 2: Why'd they bring you in
here? Why'd they bring you in here?

DRIVER: I don't... I'm just a driver, man.

MAN 1: What do you mean you're a driver?
I just drive with these guys.

That's all. They hired me to drive.

That's all I know. I
don't know nothing about...

MAN 3: This is the last
day you're ever gonna drive.

MAN 3: You know. You know!

No, I know nothing.
Shut the fuck up!

I didn't see nothing.

You fools think you guys are strong, huh?

DRIVER: I'm not strong or nothing.

MAN 2: Let me see your muscles.

I know nothing, man. I know nothing.

MAN 1: Are those man boobs?

MAN 3: Touch his fucking man boobs!

Fucking touch his boobs?
Nah, man, just...

Sit down. Both of you guys sit down.

Indian? Okay.

ROMAN: Why did you drive us here, dude?

I didn't... They told...
You told me to come.

You don't know how to sit
Indian style, motherfucker?

Please.
MAN 3: Put your fucking knees on the ground!

You're still not fucking sitting like I asked you.
How you want me to sit?

Like a fucking Indian!

How do you... Is this it? I don't know.
