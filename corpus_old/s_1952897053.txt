albino boy being born in F-3?

Want me to call your mommy

Of any hair growing on your bald head?

His father is a pilot...
Whose father is a pilot?

Weirdo's father.

And you're Marcelo...

No, no, not now,
I can't see you now.

I'm his mother, they called me.

Oh, come in please...
What did you do this time?

Look madam, if your son doesn't
change he will be a looser.

You do it!

My son!

I'm with you!

I'm here with Renato Jaques...

who has become a great success...

In a way. Renato...

What are your plans now...

What are you plans
foryour career?

Amaury, first of all, thank you...

Anyway, it's a struggle, you know?

Do you understand that, Kohai?

Do you want to be like me?
I want to be like you, dad.

You got that one, huh?!

Do you really think you've got
to leave home to become a pilot?

Yeah.
What about your mom?

Mom is never going to let me
get offthe ground, dad.

I can help you.
I don't need money.

I want to be like you are,

I want to do things
my way, all normal like.

Asign you're growing up.
I need advice.

Do you rememberthat bedtime
story I used to tell you?

Which one?

About the boy from Okinawa.
Who walked day after day...

to get to the monastery
in Tohoku.

Where Toshiro Tamaoki
taught the art of archery.

The boy arrived at the exact same
instant in which great Tamoaki,

with his eyes blindfolded,
was about to shoot an arrow.

Suddenly, the master
lets loose the arrow.

Zoooooom-pow! And he hit
the target in the bull's eye.

The boy shouted...

"Master! You hit the bull's eye!"

And the master said:
"The bull's eye hit the arrow."

The boy said,
"I don't understand, master!"

"You don't understand because
you haven't learned the art yet."

Teach me the art, master,
the boy asked.

And the master gave him
a serious look and asked him:

"Have you already had breakfast?"

And he: "Yes."

"So go wash the dishes kid."

And nowyou know
whatyou have to do.

I have to... shit, I have
to do as you've done...

Iook for a small airfield,
far away from here

and start from scratch, that's right?
Yes, start from scratch, Kohai.

Yes, it's no use looking
forthe airfield...

the airfield will find you.

My, it looks so natural,
wonderful, wonderful!

And howis Marcelo?
Great! So sweet!

Kids are great. They're great even
afterthey growup, huh?

Yeah.
Everything is so wonderful.

But, all he wants
to do now is to study.

And he's a genius,
you know, Marcelo...

it's not just because he's my son,
not at all, but he is...

Yesterday the school principal
even called me over...

to tell me that.

That he's...
That's so nice!

Yeah, my son won't bejust
going to be another nobody in life,

I won't let him be.

Marcelo will be
my pride and joy,

he will be famous and
make me so happy...

Very good.

What? What did he say?

What's that?

Tell me, who do you work for?

I work for Pacheco.

Why is he saying
you stole his plane?

I don't know...
I'm going to take you...

and then take the plane back.

What did he say to you?

Aren't you afraid
of death clown?

If you shoot me, the
plane crashes man!

I knowhowto fly too, sucker!

If you knewhowto fly,
you'd already have shot me!

Howlong you been flying?

Alone?
I'm serious, kid!

Howlong we've been
in the air?

Around forty,
forty-five minutes, why?

Plus the fifteen it took
me to get you...

Shit, that'd be
my first hour flying solo.

Is that where
we're going to land?

Yeah.

What the fuck you doing?

It's a crosswind!
Oh my God!

Joystick to one side,
pedals the other.

Hold on man, we're

Holy shit.

Shit!

Who is this guy?

Nowthat you've completed
yourfirst hour of flying...

let'sjust see howmuch
longeryou've got to live.

What are you doing, man?!

What are you doing?

Lucky boy, huh.

But, let me tell you something...

Pacheco's gun will be sure to go off.

Let's do this, you stay here...

until you become a real pilot.

I'll send the plane back,

We have a deal or not?

You'll help me get my license?

Welcome to Paraguay, kid.

Tell me, what's your name?

Carrera.

Let's go, Tatu!

Goal!

3 to 1
Come on!

Fuck!
You fool, take off the ball.

Listen, I've got a
kamikaze flight here...

with a bonus and an
additional 10%, who'll go?

Nobody? Jair?

I've got a kid to raise,
shit, give me the ball.

Open a bed and breakfast in Bahia
then if you don't want to work.

Tatu?
I'll go!

No, no, no.

Why not? What's the problem?

It's a kamikaze flight and you don't
have enough experience...

I can do it man.
I can do that!

Come on!
You were with me in the crosswind!

The cargo is worth a lot...

if you go down with it I'm the one
who's screwed, I can't...

Give me a chance, man.

Go ahead then,
it's all yours boy...

It had to be him anyway...

you'rejust all a bunch oflowlifes.

Give me the fucking ball!
Try retiring man!

Give me the ball!

Back to the game, guys.

That's it, at the center.

What's a kamikaze flight?

When the load is worth a lot, you have
to fly it kamikaze, you get me?

You take offwith just enough fuel...

to fly to the delivery point.

It's the boss's guarantee
you won't steal his load.

The airstrip is kept in the dark...

until the time you're
supposed to be arriving.

Kiddo, if you are not
a fucking good pilot...

you're screwed!

It's him, now!

Dad? Can you talk?

I think now I've become
a real pilot!

Yeah, my boss is
a great guy. It's just that.

Criminal no way. I'm a pilot...

I'm a pilot, like you!

What...

I didjust what you told me to do!

I...

Hello? Dad?

Hasta la vista, baby!
Ra-ta-ta-ta!

Come in, Carrera.
Come here.

Sit down.

Boss, I can't work
for you anymore.

What happened?

Happened...

I don't want you to get
mad at me...

but when the guys
opened those crates and...

they were full of guns inside.

I'm no good for things like that.

Son of a bitch!
No, I'm sorry, it's not...

No, no... I'm not talking about you.

It'sjust some guy in your
country I owed a favortoo!

Son of a bitch! I'm ashamed!

Guns?!

I hate guns!

Stick with me, Carrera!

I'll give you my word that
this won't happen again.

Take the cap...
It's for you.

Yes, yes.

Carrera, Carrera, Carrera.

Good night, Paraguay.

Now, I am no longer Carrera...

I am now...
Russo, Renato Russo.

Take your hands off of me
I don't belong to you

You won't get me
With all that control

I may be alone
But I know exactly where I am

You may even doubt
I don't think that's love

Only this one?

Maybe it's just imagination

Maybe nothing will happen at all

Maybe that's all in vain

Do you think we will win?

Ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô

Why fight
If we don't mean to?

Who will protect us?

Maybe we will have to answer

For our mistakes
You and I

Thank you very much!

Thank you, Paraguay.

Close the back.

Cover everything!

Great! Where's Assis?

What's wrong Assis?

What's up man?
Booze.

You drunk, man?

Beat it, beat it!

You don't work here anymore man!

Edgar, I'm going to deliverthis myself,
you stay here by the plane.

Half an hour, there and back.

Baña, we have a problem man.

Assis is drunk...

I don't knowman,
I'm going to deliver it myself.

No problem, Baña. No problem,
everything'll work out.

Come on, let's go!

What's the matter bro?

It's the engines.
You knowanything about car engines?

More or less... but
I'm in a real rush, man.

Can't you move it over
to the side of the road?

It won't start!

Could you give us a hand?
What do you think it is?

I don't know, I don't know
anything about engines.

You don't have
a license either?

We're trying to get
around the roadblock too.

I'm going up to my boss's
farm up ahead man.

This road don't lead
to no farm, no way.

It ends at a lake.

Listen, I'm real sorry, but
I can't help you guys.

I'mjust going to back up from here.
I think it's the battery...

don't you have a rope
you can pull us with?

Nope, I'm loaded
with manure here.

Could I take a look at
that manure back there?

You lose, joker.

You called me boss?

You have to go
to Brazil to get Carrera.

OK, boss.

Let's get straight
to the point here...

Tell us, what's your
boss's name - uh, Dennis.

I don't have no boss, man.

I work on my own, really.
Right.

Silva?

Tell me something, who was
it that ordered the "manure"?

I'm going to read
a list of names...

to see if you recognize
anyone ofthem, OK?

Jair? Dotori?

Teká? Mantóva?

The names these guys have.
Tatuzinho?

Baña? Carrera? Soza?

Hold it, stop!
Soza?

No the other guy. Carrera.
Right.

You knowthis guy?

And you guys don't?!

Everybody fucking knows him.

Why would that be?

Carrera is the guy's son, right?

He's not his real son,
but it's like he was.

Like he brought him up
to be his heir, understand?

Heir? It says here he'sjust
another pilot.

Just another pilot?!

The guy's a fucking
good pilot.

Considered...

You remember when they attacked
that American base in Colombia?

The DEAbase.

You guys never hear
about that?

It was Carrera.

They had a F-16 fighter plane...

and an Apache helicopter
at the base.

One ofthem was
always in the air.

If any drugs were flown through the region,
the guys would shoot it down on the spot...

no kidding, just shoot it down.

One day they shot down a plane
belonging to Carrera's father.

They say that this really
pissed him off!

So what did he do?
He took ajet...

a normal jet, painted it all black.

And souped-up the turbines so
they'd spit firejust like a bomber...

and then waited.

One day the F16 landed...

before the helicopter
could take off,

this black bomber with
fire coming out, black, matte...

of its turbines flewby
and strafed the base.

And the Americans
couldn't believe it:

What the fuck? What the fuck?
Mayday, mayday!

And whatever.

Meanwhile a plane belonging
to Carrera's fatherflewby...

full of cocaine.
You ever hearthis story?

Everybody knows about it,
fucking great story!

They say that...

they want to make
a movie out ofit with that...

blond guy... who did...

Listen...

tell us what does this
Carrera guy look like?

I don't know.
I hear he's good looking...

good-looking guy.

They say he always wears
a Porshe Carrera cap.

Listen guys, his lawyer's
already called twice.

WARRANT FOR RELEASE
But it looks like you...

ain't just no small fry,
huh, Dennis?

Awarrant for your release,
from Brasilia.

You got some heavy people
behind you, don't you man?

How does it look?
Handsome?

Can I go then?

Sure.

Listen, you can get out
ofthis life...

blanket immunity.
You ever hear ofit?

Lt'd be good foryou.

Can I go now?

Shit. We arrest them, the guys
upstairs set them free.

Call Samuca and tell him
to keep on his tail.

Samuca, the guy's leaving,
keep on his tail.

FEDERAL POLICE
He's coming out, he's leaving.

Hey Carrera...

They caught him, bro.

Fuck, it's not working...
Fuck!

What's going on man?

Where are we going?

Take this, take this.

Look howhis eyes glow
with the light.

I could throwthis fish in
the frying pan right now...

but, as a good Christian
and I'm not hungry...

I'll throwhim back
in the water.

Take the bag, it's foryou.

Open it.

A prize for keeping
your mouth shut.

You don't have to pay me
for doing that.

You deserve it.
You don't refuse gifts!

Nobody evertaught you manners?

Take it, it's yours.

Thank you.

That's better.

Use it to take a vacation,
but don't spend it all.

Vacation?

Carrera is going to have
to disappear.

You've attracted
too much attention...

and ifthey come looking for
you they just might find me.

And besides, I don't want
to lose my best pilot.

Nobody can stop Carrera, boss.

If that fish I hooked could think...

it'd thinkjust like
you, Marcelo.

My name is Carrera.

Go on back to your
mother's house...

ifl need you, I'll get in touch.

My mother?

Isn't her name Silvia?

Isn't she the one you
send money to?

Come on, Marcelo...

My name is Carrera.

You made Carrera up yourself.

Marcelo...

Son...

My dear, you...

Tell me, where have you been?

With whom have you been?

I knowyou are the one
sending me money.

I knowit's you.

I'm a plane pilot mom.

Who got you into flying?

You've always been like this,
ever since you were a kid...

Always been Like this,
haven't you?

Like what?

Like what?

Like, you're... you're...

Like what?
Like that, you're...

What am I like?

You're like... it's... Is this
what you want out of life, son?

Do you want...

You want to be a nobody
all your life? Is that it?

You got the key here?

Is the door open?

It's open...

Whiskey please.

Straight.

Breaking news.

One of the most wanted
traffickers in Brazil...

was arrested this morning
by the Federal Police.

The pilot was transporting
around two hundred kilos...

of cocaine in
a single-prop plane.

Carrera, a dangerous drug smuggler...

wanted by international police...

is suspected of having delivered
a heavy blowto the American DEA base...

Making him one of the most
well-known traffickers...

on the Brazil Paraguay border.

The investigation was
already going on for 4 months...

was made in cooperation between
the Brazilian Federal Police and...

I've got some
medicine if you want...

Need any help?

Jesus Christ, son!

What are you doing with your life?

You were right.

I'm sorry.
It's OK.

No, no, I'm sorry.
You were right.

It's OK son, OK.

Get a grip on yourself, son.
You want to wind up like Gonzalez...

sitting inside a bathroom
smelling shit the whole day?

Did you knowhe used to be
an important bullfighter in Mexico?

He told me that the biggest
mistake he's ever made in his life...

was not having died
in the arena.

And that is why
he's a nobody, nothing.

Look at me, son, look at me!

In Mexico, they say that when
a bullfighter dies in the arena...

it wasn't the bull who killed him,

it was the bullfighter
who let himselfbe killed.

I think you knowwhat you
have to do now, don't you?

Weirdo?

Is that you Weirdo, man!

You're mistaking me
for someone else.

I already knew...
For sure, it's you Weirdo!

No way! I don't know
any Weirdo man!

I'll have another one too please.

No, it's Henrique who'll be going.

I can't guarantee
that because you know...

he likes to keep a lowprofile
and he's sort of...

but who knows they can't work
out something on the spot.

That'd be great.

OK, fine.

So, we'll see you there, then.

Hey, can I take a photo?

Girls, girls!

Go on by, quick, quick.

Great, the seven and
eight o'clock soaps!

Fantastic! Great!

Smile for me Lu,
look at me, great Lu!

That is very nice!
Yeah, like that. That's it!

This'll make the front
coverfor sure, huh!?

Beautiful! Beautiful.

Have you seen my
husband around here?

No, no I haven't.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Atoast!
Cheers!

I really don't think it's right...
Give me that, Sandra!

Renato Jaques?

Hey, Eike! Howare you?
Hey, Renato! Are you having a good time?

A lot!
Great party!

Good night. Nice people!

Who? Hold it!

That is Constantino?!
Sure!

Good night, Constantino...

Great. Howare you?

Renato Jaques.
Renato...

Constantino, I'm so sorry.
What for?

Jeez, I didn't recognize
you there! Real sorry.

No way, Renato, I talked to you
because I'm a big fan of yours.

Valter! I was looking
foryou, stay here with me!

Hold it Sandra.

I'm going over to say hi
to Henrique Constantino there, look.

Henrique Is here? Where?
I'll be right back.

Jeez... that's not him!
You'll make a fool out of yourself!

What's that face like,
the one you use in the soap?!

No way... I'm working on
a newproject now...

Constantino.
Hello.

Howare you?
Fine.

Valter Meireles.
Valter. Haven't we met before?

Didn't we have dinner
once together, in Brasilia?

Yeah, I think so...
At Roberto's house.

Right.
Wasn't that it... the senator...

Yeah, you're right.

Howare you?
How's your wife, uh...

Sandra.
Sandra!

I think I sawher around
here somewhere, right?

Yeah, she's here...

but, in reality, I'd like to ask you
something aboutjets.

After all, you know
all about them, right?

Athing or two.

It'sjust that I'm thinking about
trading mine in for another one.

It's getting on my nerves,
a whistling sound...

What you have? A Learjet 24D?

Who told you?

It's because the 24D
starts making a noise,

like that when it gets up to around,

let's say, forty thousand feet.
Precisely.

But ifl were you, I'd keep it.

You think so?
It's a greatjet.

Could you take it out for a spin,
to see what you think?

Sure, wheneveryou want.
Excuse me, Valter...

Is it here?
Yes.

Excuse me. Just a second.

Could I talk to you?
Sure.

Come on there!

Eike, great party.
Thank you.

Congratulations.
Thanks.

Let me tell you something...

Jeez, keep away from that guy
Valter Meirelles.

He's a real jerk.

But, wait, isn't Valterthe owner
of... what's that factory?

He's the owner of nothing.

You're the owner...
you and your brother...

Valter is flat broke.

The money there all belongs
to his wife, Sandra, poor thing.

Why "poor thing"?

Depression. Sandra is crazy,
right, man?

Spends all her time locked up
in institutes. Forget about them man.

Look...

You wanna have some fun?

Yeah.

So, let's go man,
to the scene ofthe crime.

Let's go!
Let's go!

I'll introduce you
to some girls, come on.

My pleasure.

Nice meeting you.
We're all friends now!

Come on, come on!

I told you we would have fun...

We decorated there...

I like those...

palm trees...
Beautiful!

I can't believe the shorts
that guy is wearing, look.

What about them?

Listen, that guy there is
Henrique Constantino, you jerk.

He should dress betterthen,
don't you think?

Come on, you think he's
like your playboy friends?

Henrique is a real
down-to-earth guy, look.

I'm going to show him
my turnstile project, you'll see.

That guy there is
going to fix me up.

Well, he's shorts are
kinda cute, aren't they?

Nowyou're getting the idea.
I thought that...

No, I'm here with...
Ellen, no "H", double "L".

With Ellen without an "H".
Double "L".

What's going on?

Henrique Constantino,
he's rescheduling Ellen's ticket.

Can you pack your bag in five minutes?
Of course she can!

She's on her way then, OK?
Ohh thanks a million!

I'd like to introduce you all
to Henrique Constantino.

Who happens to be Constantino's brother.
The president of Gol Airlines.

Henrique thank you so
much for being here.

Congratulations about
the success of your company.

I was wondering if you could
explain to everyone watching us,

howGol Airlines
has managed to grow...

despite this crisis
affecting everybody?

In reality, there's no secret at all.

We base ourselves on
the basic principle...

of never owing anything
to anybody.

Constantino??
Gol Airline owner?!

This guy is Dennis! I held this guy!

And this is the first time that Gol Airlines
participate in a carnival party?

Yes, the first time...

but I think we'll be
participating more and more...

because this party here
is great, huh? Just fantastic.

So, congratulations again,
and give our best to your father...

Congratulations for
Gol Airlines's success,

and our best to all the company directors.

Thank you. And you too,

you can always count
on us for anything you need.

And fly Gol, the only way to go!

No. You talked like the
real heir of Gol Airlines.

I'll ask Renato Jaques to go with me.

Fine?

Is everything fine with you?

the guys might want to kill you?

businessmen is a drug trafficker...

ho works for one ofthe biggest drug
cartels in Latin America.

It's not the bull who
kills the bullfighter...

Is the plane fueled up?
Yes, it is.

And Mrs. Sandra? She said...

Mrs. Sandra, she...
She's not coming.

I'm going to have to call her, she said
that you'd be leaving together...

Sure, of course. If you don't believe
the owner of Gol Airlines,

you'd better call.

No, no, it's not that,
Mr. Renato, it'sjust...

Look, Paulo, if you're going
to call, call now, man,

cause I've got to shoot again one
whole episode ofthe soap opera,

he's going to Rio and
isjust doing me a favor.

She's probably asleep

He got away?
Where did he go to?

To Rio?

that they will have to invade.

Because the situation
is out of control.

Soon back with more information.

What's up? Come back here, brother!

This shit will explode like this!

And my command is in São Paulo.

And my guys there are all buddies
with your guy on the phone.

You with the PCC, bro?
Give me the fucking phone.

Listen Mico, there's this...

Mico, this is Juliano from the PCC.

If you enter, he will be killed.

Tell him to drop the guy.

Drop the guy!

The perimeter is surrounded.

Free the hostages
or we'll break in.

We want to settle this
nice and easy, captain.

"We" who boy?

Look here in my eye
and see if I'm lying.
