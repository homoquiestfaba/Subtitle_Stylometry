(BELL RINGING)
(LAUGHTER)





Oh, really? Okay, okay.

Yeah, why not?

Hey, isn't that Mia?

CATHERINE: I'm so sorry,
I-I must have slipped.

GIRL: Did you have a nice swim there?
(LAUGHTER, SPLASHING)

Don't touch me.

(LAUGHTER)
GIRL: Oh, my God!

CATHERINE: It was an accident, I swear.


Dude, your sister is so lame.

She's not my sister.

Come on.

ALEXA: Let's go.


Oh, my God!

CATHERINE: Such a loser!


Why is she all wet? I swear!

I'm sorry about that.

But we are going to
see you tomorrow, right?

Yeah. Tomorrow.

Okay. Bye.

It's going to be amazing! I promise!

Amazing! Bring your bikini!

Do you want to tell me what happened?

You should just drive.

(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC)

Hey, Mrs. Riley.

Hey!

Whoa, did you go for
a swim in your clothes?

MIA: Shut up, Ben!

Hey, Mimi!

MIA: Don't call me that!

Why are you all wet?

Why is she all wet?

I have to talk to her, babe.

What happened? Hey! What happened?

Somebody pushed her in the pool at school.

No big deal.

It's not my fault that nobody likes her.

You know, that's a real nasty thing to say.

Sorry.

Sasha!

Look, I know it's tough moving here,

but you two got to look
out for each other, okay?

Okay.

Thanks.

You guys about done?

Yeah, you are all loaded up, boss.

Alright. Thanks, Ben.

See you tomorrow?

See you tomorrow, Carl. Get some rest.

Yeah. I will do.

Alright, thanks.

(BIRDS SINGING, TREES RUSTLING)

(KNOCK ON THE DOOR)

JENNIFER: Hey. Mind if I come in?

What's going on?

I hate it here.

Mia, you're so much stronger
than you think you are.

And if your Mom were here,
she'd be really proud of you.

Well, she's not here, is she?

Well, I'm proud to call you my daughter.

Look, I know you and Sasha have a
hard time sometimes, but we're family.

She's not my sister.

(WAVES LAPPING)

(GRANT MURMURS)

It's very good.

It's great.

(GRANT SIGHS)

Hey, I almost forgot to show you
guys what I found this morning.

Look at this.

(JENNIFER MURMURS)

MIA: That's a shark tooth.

Yeah.

MIA: Is it a great white?

GRANT: I think so.

Where did you find it?

We uncovered a passageway that
leads to a new part of the city.

JENNIFER: Nice.

MIA: But how did the shark get in there?

I don't know.

Maybe he swam in from
the sea, chasing a seal,

GRANT: got lost in the
tunnels hundreds of years ago.

That's so cool!

GRANT: You can keep it.

That kind of brings me
around to something else.

GRANT: Girls, I know I said I was
going to hang with you this weekend,

GRANT: but opening this new passageway,

GRANT: it means that there's
this team of archaeologists.

GRANT: They fly in from Europe next week.
MIA: It's fine, Dad.

So I got to finish mapping
the caves, laying the lights...

You don't have to explain.

But your father planned something
very special for the two of you.

What?

Well, the shark tooth is a clue.


Girls, come on. Here, show them.

JENNIFER: There you go.

A glass bottomed boat ride

SASHA: to see great white
sharks in their natural habitat?

Sounds fun to me.

No. This is for tourists.

Well, we're kind of tourists.

Girls, it's going to be awesome.

They take you out to where
the great whites feed.

You get to watch them through this
viewing gallery in the bottom of the ship.

GRANT: It's awesome.

No. I have plans for tomorrow.

Well, you'll just have
to rearrange your plans.

And besides, I think this is a
wonderful way for the two of you

JENNIFER: to spend quality time together.
GRANT: Yeah.


JENNIFER: Where are you going?

To let Alexa and Nicole know
that I can't hang out tomorrow.

Is that okay?

Watch your tone.

Well, I am sorry about tomorrow, but
the sharks are going to be really cool.

And maybe next week you
and I can go scuba diving.

GRANT: Remember how much you
used to like diving with me?

Yeah, I was, like, ten years old, Dad.

Ten years old. The youngest
person I'd ever seen scuba dive.

Come on. Are you kidding me?

JENNIFER: And the cutest.

GRANT: Yeah, you were
like a little sea monkey.

(JENNIFER LAUGHS)


ANNOUNCER: Alright, guys. Who's
ready to see some sharks today?

(BEN LAUGHS)
(CROWD NOISE)

GRANT: I'll pick you up
on the way home. Okay?

GRANT: Alright.

GRANT: Hey, Mimi, don't
get eaten by a shark!

Stop!

Yeah, Mimi, don't get eaten by a shark!

(BEN LAUGHS)

(CARL HOLLERS)

Hey, if you start to drown,
we'll come and save you.

I'll save you!

(LAUGHTER)
(CAR HORN BEEPS)

(CARL AND BEN HOLLER)


Look!

CATHERINE: I can't believe she's here.

Oh, my gosh!

(CAR SCREECHES)
(CAR HORN BEEPS)

(CAR SCREECHES)

(HORN BEEPS)

What the hell are you guys doing here?

NICOLE: Come on. We had plans.

I told you, I can't.

Dude, I am going to
take you to a place that

no tourists would ever
find in a million years.

Chance of a lifetime.

Or would you rather stay
on this stupid boat instead?

Yeah.

ALEXA: I mean stay. Stay if you want to.

Hey, maybe you can become
friends with Catherine.

(CATHERINE GIGGLES)

ALEXA: Talk about how beautiful she is!

She is beautiful though.

Dude, shut up!

It's up to you.

NICOLE: Come on!
SASHA: One second.

(TONGUE CLICKS)

SASHA: You really want to spend
all day on a boat with those girls?

SASHA: Come on.

CATHERINE: She's so scared.

(ALEXA SIGHS)
NICOLE: What do you think?

I don't know.

Don't let those girls get to you.

Catherine.


SASHA: Come on.


Goodbye, Catherine.

(UPBEAT POP MUSIC)

Let's go. Come on.




(EXCITED CHATTER)

(LAUGHTER AND CHATTER)

(MUSIC ECHOES)

(JUNGLE WILDLIFE SOUNDS)

Okay, watch your step.

(ALEXA GASPS)

ALEXA: Guys, come on! We're almost there.

SASHA: You keep saying that.

ALEXA: This time I mean it.

(ALEXA SIGHS)


Oh, my God!

(NICOLE CHUCKLES)

NICOLE: Whoa!

SASHA: I mean, how did you
even find out about this place?

ALEXA: Ben took me here.

SASHA: Ben? Like my
stepdad's assistant Ben?

Oh, she... stop with that. Oh, my God!


Okay, so how do we get down there?

So there's a path that'll
take us around and down.

(NICOLE SCREAMS)

(NICOLE CHEERS)
(SPLASH)

Or you could go that way.

(SPLASH)
(NICOLE GASPS)

What are you waiting for?

It's amazing!

SASHA: I don't know, I...

(ALEXA SCREAMS)

(SPLASH)
(ALEXA CHEERS)

We should take the path.

(ALEXA AND NICOLE LAUGH AND SHRIEK)

That was amazing!

Screw the path.

(MIA AND SASHA SCREAM)

(MUSIC FADES)

That's so cool.

NICOLE: Look at all this stuff.

Whoa.

(SASHA GASPS)

SASHA: That's a lot of scuba gear.

This is all the equipment that your
stepdad and Ben have been storing

for the archaeologist team
that's coming next week.

Is this the entrance to the City?

MIA: Guys, if my Dad finds
us, he's going to kill us.

ALEXA: Chill. I talked to Ben.

ALEXA: Your Dad is on the other side,
mapping out the new tunnel they found.

ALEXA: They will never know we were here.

Doesn't look like much of a city to me.

It's Mayan.

It was built underground,
out of their burial sites,

to hide from the Conquistadors
when they invaded.

Rising sea levels put
most of it underwater.

NICOLE: Thank you, Professor.

NICOLE: Did Ben ever take
you diving into the city?

Yeah, once.

MIA: What's it like?

It's pretty insane down there.

I mean, we only went as
far as the first cave.

It was built as an entrance to

ALEXA: ...is it Xibalba? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MIA: Xibalba! Yeah!

MIA: Place of fear.
ALEXA: Yeah.

Like I was saying, the Mayan underworld.

Burial caves.

Yeah, it's pretty scary,
but it's really cool.

They have all these old
statues, and altars, and stuff.

So what are we waiting for?

Come on. Just the first cave.

MIA: But my Dad...
NICOLE: Is miles away!

Yeah, they have a different way in.

Here, look. Everything we need.

I mean, there's no fins, so...

Come on! It's the first cave.
We're not swimming the whole city.

Guys, cave diving is dangerous.

NICOLE MOCKING MIA:
Cave diving is dangerous!

SASHA: No. Mia is right, Nicole.

I don't really know about this.

Look, we've come all this way and
we don't even see the temple? Really?

It's unlike anything you ever seen before.
NICOLE: Yeah.

ALEXA: We should just go in, go once
around the first cave, and then out.

NICOLE: Yeah. Come on.

When was the last time you went diving?

Years ago.

MIA: I used to go all the time with Dad,
ALEXA: Perfect.

but I've never been in caves before.

It's like riding a bike, right? I mean...

NICOLE: Come on, Mia!

Mimi!

NICOLE: Yeah, she's going to do it!
Let's go! Let's go, that's great!

ALEXA AND SASHA: Let's go, Mia! Yes!
NICOLE: Come on! We're doing it, let's go!

Hey, it's going to be fun, okay?

Just remember, keep your
movements nice and small.

Last thing you want to do
is kick up silt down there.

You won't be able to see your own hands.

ALEXA: Okay. You guys ready?

I'm going to lead. Keep
behind me at all times.

One circuit around the
first cave, and back.

NICOLE: Yes, teacher.

ALEXA: Nicole, I'm serious.
Either you do as I say, or...

Yeah, I hear you.
(SPLASH)

we don't do it at all.

(NICOLE GIGGLES)

(UNDERWATER ECHO)
(SPLASH)

(NICOLE SHRIEKS AND LAUGHS)

NICOLE: Let's go, ladies. Get a move on.

Everyone okay? Sasha, are you good?

Yeah.

ALEXA: Mia?

Yeah, I'm good.

Everybody check your air gauges.
You should all have a full tank.

MIA: Mine's on 100 percent.

SASHA: Me too.

NICOLE: Come on, I'm getting old already!

Okay. Turn your lights on.

Follow me. The entrance is
just at the bottom of the steps.

Let's go.

(WATER MOVEMENT)
(BREATHING)

ALEXA: You guys are going to
freak out. It's insane down there.

ALEXA: Come on!

SASHA: Oh, my God. Are you sure about this?

ALEXA: Yeah, trust me.

NICOLE: Oh, my God! This is so crazy!

ALEXA: I can't believe we're
doing this. (ALEXA LAUGHS)

Look at that.

(BUBBLING SOUND)

ALEXA: Run out of air in a cave, and your
last chance is sucking the air from those.

Seriously?

ALEXA: For sure. You want to try it?

The corridor gets narrow
up here, so single file.

Just through here.

ALEXA: You all okay?

NICOLE: Yup.
SASHA: Yeah.

MIA: Yeah, I'm good.

NICOLE: Sasha, you could barely
get your ass through there.

(SASHA LAUGHS)

Shut up, Nicole. At least I have an ass.

ALEXA: All okay? Mia?

MIA: Yeah.
ALEXA: Sasha?

(SASHA MURMURS)
ALEXA: Nicole?

NICOLE: Yes, teacher!

You guys ready for this?

(GENERATOR SOUND)


SASHA: ...crap!

MIA: That's so cool!
(SASHA LAUGHS)

ALEXA: I told you guys.

Xibalba.

This place is insane, right?

Hey. Nicole! No!

Keep behind me and keep together.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

One lap around the altar,
and then we head back, right?

SASHA: Right.

Let's go.

(NICOLE GIGGLES)


Oh, my God!

MIA: They made human sacrifices here.

Creepy.

NICOLE: Guys, did you see that?

I think I saw something move.

ALEXA: There's nothing down here, Nicole.

NICOLE: There was something there.

ALEXA: Oh, come on, Nicole.
(SASHA LAUGHS)

Maybe it was a mermaid.

NICOLE: Shut up, Sasha. I'm serious.

ALEXA: Come on, Nicole.
Stop messing around.

MIA: Maybe it was my Dad.

ALEXA: Your Dad's on the
other side of the city.

ALEXA: There's nothing there.
Nicole's just being an idiot.

NICOLE: I heard that, Alexa.

Come on, let's just go back.

We said we would come in, and
then head straight back out, right?

ALEXA: Nicole!

Nicole?

SASHA: Nicole, stop being an idiot.


NICOLE: Come, look, look!

NICOLE: Look!

ALEXA: Oh, my God!

NICOLE: Where are its eyes?

MIA: It doesn't have any.

MIA: It's a Mexican
tetra... a blind cave fish.

ALEXA: Wait, I heard about these.

No light down here, so they
don't need color or eyes.

They evolved without.

SASHA: How does it know where it's going?

MIA: Heightened senses.

I didn't know they got this big.

It's probably never known a human.

It's hiding from us.

Well, who says it's us it's hiding from?

Stop! (LAUGHTER)

NICOLE: Here, fishy fishy! Nice to meet...
ALEXA: No, Nicole. I wouldn't.

(SCREECHING)
(NICOLE SCREAMS)

ALEXA: No!
(NICOLE SCREAMS)

(NICOLE SCREAMS)

No, stop it from falling!

No!

(PILLAR CRUMBLING SOUND)

(MIA'S MUFFLED SCREAMS)

MIA: Guys? Guys?

(DISTORTED RADIO VOICE)

MIA: I can't hear you!

ALEXA'S VOICE DISTORTED: Nobody move!

MIA: Anyone? Nicole? Sasha, where are you?

(ALEXA'S VOICE DISTORTED)

MIA: Guys? I can't see
you guys, where are you?

(MIA BREATHING FRANTICALLY)

MIA: Sasha... I can't hear
you, guys, where are you?

MIA: Sasha!

MIA: I can't see anyone.

(ALEXA'S VOICE DISTORTED)

MIA CRYING: Sasha!

(MIA BREATHING FRANTICALLY)

Sasha!

Alexa, I can't see!

ALEXA'S VOICE DISTORTED: Mia!

BEN: Mia! What are you doing here?

Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

MIA: We were at the lake and...
BEN: Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

BEN: Calm down, alright? It's okay.
MIA: It was really stupid, I'm sorry.

Let me guess. Alexa persuaded
you to come down here, huh?

And then we knocked over a stone column,

and I got totally lost in the silt.

You didn't think to come
down here with a guideline?

ALEXA: Mia! Mia! Thank God!

BEN: Oh, man, I should've known.

So you thought you'd try a
little bit of cave diving, huh?

I'm... I'm so sorry.

Honestly, we were supposed to just go
in and then straight back out again.

BEN: That's the last time I'm
showing you any of my secret spots.

BEN: I take it Sasha
and Nicole are close by?

ALEXA: They're waiting by the exit.

BEN: Yeah? What a surprise.

BEN: Let's just get you guys the hell
out of here before your Dad finds out.

MIA: You're not going to tell him, are you?

BEN: Are you kidding me?

(CRASHING WATER SOUNDS)
(MIA AND ALEXA SCREAM)

(WATER SPLASHING AS BEN STRUGGLES)
(BEN SCREAMS)

MIA: Alexa, where are the others?

MIA, FRANTICALLY: Where are
they? Sasha? Nicole? Sasha?

SASHA'S VOICE ON RADIO: Mia! Where are you?

NICOLE: Sasha! Look
they're here, they're here!

MIA: Guys, there's a shark.

SASHA: Mia, what is it?

MIA: There's a shark. I'm serious.

MIA: It killed Ben.

SASHA: What?

ALEXA CRYING: We have
to go. We have to go now.

NICOLE: You're really
freaking me out right now.

SASHA: Guys, if this is some
kind of joke, it's not funny.

MIA: Sasha, behind you!

SASHA: Yeah, right. (SASHA SCREAMS)

(SHARK HAMMERING AGAINST ROCKS)

Push. Help me push. Come on.

Push.

Help me move these rocks.

(NICOLE BREATHING FRANTICALLY)

ALEXA: Push.

NICOLE: We're trapped.

ALEXA: There has to be a way out.

ALEXA: Come on.

SASHA: You guys, it's pointless.
It's pointless. Alexa! Alexa!

(ALEXA GROANS)

SASHA: Alexa! Look at me.

SASHA: You said Ben and my Dad
went through a different entrance.

ALEXA: Sasha, this place is a maze.
I would never be able to find him.

MIA: Guys! Guys, there's a line.

Ben... Ben, he had the guideline with him.

It leads back to where they were working.

NICOLE: What about the shark?

MIA: It looked blind. Like the tetra fish.

MIA: It must have evolved down here.

When my dad opened up the new
cave, it must have let him through.

SASHA: Mia, was that a great white?

Yeah, I think so.

Everybody check your air.

SASHA: I have about forty percent left.

SASHA: What about you guys?

MIA: I have forty.

NICOLE: Thirty eight.

ALEXA: Thirty five.

Okay, we don't have much of
a choice, as far as I can see.

Everyone needs to stay close, okay?

ALEXA: But what about the shark?

MIA: We can do this, Alexa.
It's going to be okay.

SASHA: Okay, come on. Let's go.

(SWIMMING SOUNDS)

SASHA: The line's caught on something.

(ALEXA PANICS) ALEXA: Come
on. Sasha, we need to move.

(EERIE MUSIC)

SASHA: Guys.

(ALEXA SHIVERS WITH FEAR)

What are we going to do?

SASHA: We need to keep going.

We're going to die down here.

SASHA: No. Grant has to be close.

SASHA: We can't give up.

(ALEXA CRYING)

(EERIE MUSIC)

(SASHA'S CLOSE BREATHING)

ALEXA: No, no, it's a dead
end. We have to go back.

SASHA: There's no other way.
Where are we going to go back to?

ALEXA: We're going to run out
of air. We're going to drown.

ALEXA: We're going to drown!

Wait! Wait!

MIA: It's too narrow
for the shark to follow.

MIA: Are you okay?
ALEXA: I'm fine.


SASHA: Guys, the air tastes bad.

ALEXA: It's an air pocket.
It's been here a while.

We can't breathe it for long.

MIA: So what do we do?

SASHA: I can't see any way out of here.

SASHA: How much air do you have left?

NICOLE: Okay.

MIA: I'll let you know
when I'm on the other side.

There's no point in
all of us using our air.

MIA: We found a small air pocket.

MIA: She's back there with Alexa and
Nicole, but I can't hear them any more.

SASHA: Shut it off!
ALEXA: Don't!

GRANT: Girls! Girls! Look!


They're gone.

Where did they go?

MIA: They're scared of it.

The sharks... they've evolved blind,

and they have a heightened
sense of hearing.

GRANT: It must be the frequency.

MIA: Maybe we can use the
alarm to scare them away.

MIA: I mean, someone's
going to come looking

for us when we don't
come back tonight, right?

SASHA: The only people that know
where we are, are right here.

GRANT: I just found the
entrance to this cave.

GRANT: I'm the only one
who knows where it is.

GRANT: And there's no way we can
get back up without the ascender.

SASHA: What are we going to do?

GRANT: We got to go back
down. There's no other way now.

ALEXA: What?
MIA: What?

GRANT: Listen, this
cave goes out to the sea.

If we follow it, we'll
come out in the ocean.

GRANT: There'll be strong currents there
that are going to try and suck us down.

GRANT: So we're going
to have to keep together.

ALEXA: No. We're going to die down there.

GRANT: If we stay here, we'll die.

We're going to watch each other's backs.

And we can survive this.

Okay? Girls, I believe in you.

What are we going to do?

We have to do what he said.

MIA: No!
ALEXA: Yes, we have to go back down.

I can't. I can't do this. I can't. I can't.

SASHA: Mia, we have to go.
We have to do what he said.

SASHA: We have to go back down.

SASHA: He wouldn't want
you to give up now, okay?

Do we even have enough air?

We have no choice.

What if we're wrong?

What if the alarm has nothing to
do with why the sharks are gone?

We got to try.

You ready?
