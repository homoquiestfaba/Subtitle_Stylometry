Oh, did you see the ray?
(chuckles) Yeah, huge.

Look what I got.
Whoa, nice.


Hey

Look what I scored.

(all laugh)

What? How did you do that?

You need to learn
the way of the fish.

Having fun, sis?

Yeah.
Group shot.

All right, okay, you ready?
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.
One, two, three, smile.

(shutter clicking)
(soft orchestral music)

That was so much fun.

(both chuckle)

I'm so glad you got
me back into diving.

You're a natural.

Like you?

(waves crashing)

(birds squawking)

Hey, what's that?

Oh, I don't know.
How good

are the islands going to be?

I know, right?

The tropical water,
all that sunshine,

fish everywhere.
Mm, yeah.

Can't wait.

Greg come around to it yet?

Not really.
Come on.

It's just like book club only
with fish and spear guns.

He gets that, doesn't he?

Sort of.
Hmm.

He'll come around to
it once he realizes

what it means to you.

Isn't that Greg?

Yeah, it is.

Hey, babe. Ladies.

What are you doing here?

a nice way to greet the guy

who's come to give
you a ride home.

But I said I had a lift.

Okay, well, I
thought it'd be nice

to pick you up myself.

Thank you.

See you, sis.

See you guys.
See ya.

(ambient music)

Hey, this is Cath.
Leave a message, bye.

Hey, sis. Uh, hope all's okay.

Um, just give me a ring. Bye.

(upbeat electronic music)

(door closes)

Hey.

How was your day?

Hmm?

Have you left the house at all?

Uh, well, I'm an exotic bloom,

so I'm not meant to be outside.

Oh, okay, well, exotic bloom,

like we agreed, if you're gonna
be staying here for a while,

you need to be
pulling your weight.

You sound like mom.

Well, she has a point.

Look, I'm just
different. Okay?

I'm not like you and Cath.

Mm-hmm.

(phone dings)

(ominous music)

Hey, I gotta go, but
I'll be back soon, okay?

(phone ringing)

Hey, this is Cath.
Leave a message, bye.

(ominous music)

(door creaking)

Hello?

(suspenseful music)

Greg?

Greg?

Greg?

She wouldn't listen.

(suspenseful music)

Where's Cath?

Where's my sister?

She made me do it.

(waves crashing)

Hello.
(gasps) There she is!

How are you?

Wow, look at you.

Ah, Jodes, guess who's here?

Nic! We we starting to worry.

I didn't know if you
got my last message

about the change of address.

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

It's, uh, hard getting
online in rural India.

India. How was that?

It was good.

Well, I got something.

(bag unzips)

Tequila?
Ooh-ah!

Party time.
(Nic chuckles)

(soft electronic music)

It's so good to see you.

Yeah, you too.

It's amazing, isn't it?

Yeah, it is.

Yeah, I'll go get the drinks.

(ice cubes clinking)

What do you
think? Is she okay?

At least she's here.

Yeah.

Ready?
Ready.

(soft electronic music)

Here you go

Oh, thanks.

What? Annie.

Oh my God. What
are you doing here?

I wanted to surprise you.

Huh. Yeah, you've
definitely done that.

So what you're into diving now?

Well, yeah, sort of.


What's that?

Oh, that, we wanted
to talk to you about it.

You know, coming here
was Cath's dream.

So we thought it'd
be the perfect place

to pay our tributes.

We all thought it
was a good idea,

but if you don't
think it's right then-

No, no, I'm sure
it's great. (chuckles)

Uh, I'm kind of tired
from the long trip.

Where's my room?

Yeah, I'll show you.

Hmm.

(both sighing)

Here you go.

Thanks.

(tense music)
(fan whirring)

(door closes)

(Nic crying)

(Cath screaming)
(water bubbling)

(Nic gasping and crying)

(soft dramatic music)

(waves crashing)

Can I have the wine after you?

Yeah.
Oof, look at you go.

Want some more.
Yes. (laughs)

Why don't we make a toast here?

Top up?

Oh, yeah, thank you.

(wine pouring)

Hmm.

What have you been up to?

Not much.

Um, just working,
looking after mom.

I made an apple
pie the other day.

What? You're cooking?


(glasses clink)
(both chuckle)

(waves crashing)

So is it true?

You were working in the
Greek Islands on a dive boat?


Yeah, taking happy
snaps of rich divers.

But, um, yeah, it
didn't really work out.

Stopped diving, actually.

Really?

Yeah.

Hey, come and help me
cook the marshmallows

'cause I keep dropping
them in the fire. (laughs)

Watch out for that.

Clutz.
(Annie chuckles)

(soft dramatic music)

Here.

(indistinct chattering)

(women laughing)

(fire crackling)

(Nic sighs)

(soft dramatic music)

Three days of
paddling. Three days?

I thought you said it was two.

It's two nights, but
three days paddling.

Two days wouldn't
be worth coming for.

Three days of paddling.

Don't worry. We'll
take it easy on you.

Won't we, Jodie?

Of course.

You did say that there was
gonna be a four-star resort.

There is, absolute luxury,
rising pool, cocktails.

Everything a girl could want.

That's the third night.

The third night? Great.

(gentle guitar music)
(waves crashing)

Here we go.

Look at that.
Oh.

Oh my God.
Come on, slow pokes.

(Annie chuckles)

Let's go.


Actually, Annie,
thinking about it,

maybe you should take
one of the yellow ones.

Easier to get in and out of.

Sure.
Lisa,

you'll take the
other yellow one.

Okay.

Okay. Let's get packing

And remember to distribute
the weight evenly.

Is she always this alpha?

Mostly. (chuckles)

(ominous music)

(waves crashing)

(suit zipping)

Okay. Let's go.

(bright music)

(water burbling)

(water sloshing)

(Annie breathes uneasily)

How are you? You okay?

Yeah.

You look tired.

You wanna take a break?

No, I'm not really tired.
I don't need a break.

You know, Annie
don't get me wrong,

it's great to see
you, it's just like

this isn't really you.

(birds squawking)

You might be surprised.

Come on. I'll tow you.

I'm fine. Thanks.

(paddle taps)
(water splashes)

(Nic sighs)

Hmm.

(soft guitar music)
(water burbling)

(water sloshing and dripping)

this is the place.

Yes. Hey, we're
gonna go for a dive.

Oh. It's so beautiful.

(Annie chuckles)

(Nic breathes uneasily)
(ominous music)

(Nic exhaling)

Mm.
Oh.

Hey.

Ready?

Uh, I'm just
gonna float up here.

Come with us?

Okay.

(ominous music)

Let's go over here for a bit.

(water sloshing)

Nic, follow me down?

I'll come down in a minute.

Okay.

(kayaks thudding)

(intense music)

Oh, hey.
Hi.

Can you help me get out?

Well, yeah, of course.

Okay.

I think I've
damaged my spearhead.

(suspenseful music)

Hey, you coming down?

Oh, my sinuses are playing up.

Think I'm coming
down with something.

Okay. See you soon?

Mm. Yeah.

Okay.

(water splashes)

(water sloshing)

swimming on that island.

Wait, what's that?

Lots of fish around.
Must be a bait ball.

(water burbling)
(suspenseful music)

(water sloshing)

Shit.

What?
I think I saw a shark.

Was it big?

I don't know. I, I just
saw the tip of the fan.

(suspenseful music)
(water burbling)

(spear gun fires)

We should let them know, right?

Yeah.
Nic!

Nic, there's a shark!

(suspenseful music)
(water burbling)

Nic, there's a shark!

Come on! Nic!

Look out! There's a shark!


Check this out.


(Jodie panting)

(suspenseful music)

Nic, come back! I
think I saw a shark!

Come back!

(water burbling)

(suspenseful music)


Okay.
Stay calm.

Don't splash.

(suspenseful music)
(water sloshing)

(Nic breathes uneasily)

(water burbling)

I didn't see anything.
(breathes uneasily)

(suspenseful music)

(water splashing)

You saw a shark?

Annie did.

How big?

I don't know. I
just saw the tip.

It's probably a reefy.
There's lots of 'em around.

Yeah. They're mostly harmless.

So many fish came through.

I know. Look what I scored.

Oh, wow.

It's almost lunch time.

The sooner we get to the
island, sooner we eat.

Nic, why don't
you and I go ahead

and start cooking up this fish?

You sure you're okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.

I was just worried
about you guys.

Go cook lunch. I'm starving.

Okay.

Okay?
All right, let's go.

(water splashing)

(water sloshing)

Feeling better?

Yeah.

Nice.

(Annie breathes uneasily)

You all good?

Yeah. I'm fine.

Is that the first
time you've met the man

in the gray suit?

What?
The man in the gray suit.

That's what surfers call sharks.

Really?
Yeah.

I've seen a few.

They're pretty timid usually.

It's the big ones you
have to worry about.

(Jodie whimpering)

(kayaks thudding)

Annie, we need
to flip the kayak.

Yeah.

Hey, you're gonna have
to get in the water.

(Annie breathes uneasily)

I'm gonna get in, we'll
turn it over, okay?

(Nic breathes uneasily)

(suspenseful music)

We have to get to the island.

That's where we're going.

No, I mean right now.

There are kids swimming
on that island.

(suspenseful music)


Jodie! Jodie!

There are kids in the water.

Oh my God. I'll go warn them.

You stay with Annie.

You're okay. You're
all right, baby.

(Demi sobbing)
You're okay.

(water splashing)

Are you okay? Hey?

(Demi sobbing)

(indistinct chattering)

Lisa's gone. She's gone.

Come here. It's okay.

(Jodie sobbing)
It's okay.

(Nic breathes uneasily)

Okay. All right, come on.

Hey. It's gone, right?

Come on. Let's go, okay?

(Demi sobbing)

Demi! Demi!

Here, here! I got her!

Get her up here! Come on!

Get the towels! Quick, quick!

Oh gosh.

Give them to me. Okay, okay.

We have to put pressure on it.

(Demi sobbing)
Keep pressing, that's fine.

Keep pressing. Keep pressing.

Okay. You're okay.

You're gonna be
fine. Look at me.

Okay, yeah. Look at me.

Is there anyone
else on this island?

No. We came here fishing
with our husbands two days ago.

Okay. Where are they?

They've gone.
They've taken the boat.

They'll be gone for days.

(Demi sobbing)

Okay. You're
okay, you're okay.

Maybe we should elevate the leg.

Right.
Here are a few towels.

It's okay. You're
gonna be okay.

You're all right.

And breathe in.
Okay.

It's all right.
Here you go.

Here you go, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

Do you have any phone
reception, internet,

any way of getting help?

No. It's all dead.

The, the next island there's
reception and people.

Okay. What about boats?

There's, there's a runner boat.

Okay. Can you show us?

(waves lapping)

(suspenseful music)

That? That's not safe.

Look what it did to the kayaks.

Hey, what are you doing?

I'm just gonna have a look.

Wait. I'll come with you.

(water sloshing)

(suspenseful music)

(suspenseful music)

(water sloshing)

(boat scraping)

(waves lapping)

(Nic sighs)

I know we have to help her.

Okay? I know that.

But this, this won't
get us to the island.

You saw what it did to the
kayaks and the pontoon.

Jodie?

Yeah, it's not great.

So there are no other boats?

What if we make it more stable?

If we tie one of the kayaks here

and the other one here,
we can make it stable.

Yeah, maybe,

but we're still
not gonna be safe.

(soft dramatic music)

What are you doing?

I'm going to try it out.

Let me help ya.

Annie.

I know we need to get to
the island, but not like this

Annie, this isn't safe.

We need to get her help.

I'm going to get the kayaks.

No. Jodie.

Annie, please just wait!

(motor buzzing)

Annie!

(intense music)
(water rushing)

(Cath screaming)

(water bubbling)

(Nic breathes uneasily)

(motor buzzing)

Is this good?
Yeah, it's good.

Three, two, one.

I can't get it out of my mind.

Poor Lisa.

Jodie, come here.

Look, what happened
to Lisa was...

But we have to keep going.

You made it.
(breathes uneasily)

Yeah, once you get used
to it, it handled okay.

So we just need to
finish trying it here

and then we can go get help.

So this is your plan?

Yep.

Yeah, it's that simple?

I guess so.

"Cause what could
possibly go wrong?

Look, if you don't
wanna come, that's fine.

It's not that.

We need to slow down and we
need to think this through.

We don't have time to slow down.

Yes, there is. We need
to think this through.

I have thought this through.

No you haven't. Not properly.

Would you just listen to me?

This isn't you,
you can't do this!

Don't tell me what
I can and can't do!

You don't know me.

And you know what?

Your sister Cath,
your best friend.

You didn't know her either.

(soft dramatic music)

(Nic breathes uneasily)

We have to do something.

(Nic breathes uneasily)

(suspenseful music)

Remember what to do?

Mm-hmm.
Hi.

How are you all?

Here. These are for you.

Some protection
if it comes back.

Thank you.
No, thank you.

We pray and make it to
the next island safely.

(waves lapping)

(machete scraping)

I'm coming with you.

You don't have to
do that, Nic. Really.

Yes, I do.

Okay.

(suspenseful music)

Here.

Let's go.

Three, two, one, push.

(motor buzzing)

(soft dramatic music)

(water splashing)

(motor buzzing)

(waves slapping)

Looks like we're
near the channel.

(suspenseful music)

(water sloshing)

Shit.

What?
We're leaking.

Oh shit.

How bad is it?
I don't know.

It's hard to tell but
it's definitely coming in.

Here, bucket.

Where's it coming from?

Can anyone see where
it's coming from?

(Annie gasps)
Oh shit.

Sorry.

Let me have a go.
No, it's all right.

I've got it.
Sit down.

(Nic breathes uneasily)

(motor stalling)

Fuck.

(motor stalling)

Come on.

Check the petrol.
Come on.

It's not the petrol.

Please, check.

(suspenseful music)
(water burbling)

It's half full.

Maybe we hit something.
Check the prop.

I don't think so.
I would've felt it.

(motor clattering)
Oh, shit.

(water burbling)

Here, let me have a go.

(suspenseful music)

(motor clattering)

(water splashing)

(Nic gasping)

What is it?

Nic?

I thought I heard something.

(water sloshing)

(motor stalling)

Fuck!

I knew we shouldn't have
come out here in this thing.

Well, we had to do something.

Look I know, but not in this!

I said you didn't have to come.

I said that Jodie and
I were gonna do it.

would have changed anything!

This still would've
happened, Annie!

Okay. Well at least
I tried something.

At least I did something and
I didn't run away like you.

Fuck you!
No, fuck you!

All right, all right. Enough.

(soft dramatic music)

All we can do is paddle.

So let's paddle.

(oars splashing)

What did you mean

back at the beach?

What did you mean when you said

I didn't know who
you and Cath were?

Oh, nothing.

It was nothing.

Can you just tell me?

Okay.

Well, you didn't
come to the funeral,

and then the next day you
are out of the country

and you haven't come back.

I was left holding
it all together.

The funeral, the police inquiry.

Mom's depression. Mine.

I'm not as weak
as you think I am.

Who said you were weak?

And Cath, she
wasn't weak either.

You didn't know her
and you don't know me.

You left.

I couldn't.

I just couldn't.

(oars splashing)

(suspenseful music)

Hey, look.

Paddle. Come on, paddle.

(paddles splashing)

That's it, come on.

Uh!

You're all right. It's okay.

Come on. I've got you.

Let me see. Let me see.

Come on.

Here. Get this off.

Get this off.

Oh, my God. Just
got the life jacket.

Oh my God. It missed you.

It missed you.
Oh!

(both crying)

(soft dramatic music)

You're alive.

You're alive.

I'm sorry for everything,

for not being there to help you,

for not being at the
funeral, just everything.

I just, I couldn't,
I couldn't, I just...

I could have done
something. I...

(Nic sobbing)

I should have known. I
could have done something.

Save my sister, I should
have done something.

No one knew. That's
the worst part.

She never said anything.

(Nic sobbing)

(soft dramatic music)

(water spraying)

(suspenseful music)

(intense music)
(Jodie gasping)

Oh, God. It's still here.

What the fuck? Fuck off!

Shit!

(all gasping)

I can't see it anywhere.
Oh, fuck.


There!

Fuck.

Oh my God. Oh my God.

Why doesn't it leave
us the fuck alone?

(suspenseful music)

Nic, what are we gonna do?

We have to get to that island.

(water sloshing)

We have to keep paddling.

Nic?

Nic?

No.

No?

No more paddling.

What, what do you mean?

That thing is stalking us.

Okay, I don't know why,

if it's the paddling or what,

but it's hunting us and
it's not gonna stop.

We head for that island,
it'll come for us again.

We have to get rid of it.

We need to kill it.
(chuckles) Are you crazy?

It's a huge fucking shark.

How are we going to do that?

Do we still have that fish?

Yeah, why?

We trap it.

We put the fish on the anchor,

then we tie the
anchor to the kayak.

When it takes it, it'll
get stuck to the kayak,

and it'll drown.

This is ridiculous.

To beat it, we're gonna have
to try something different.

We're not gonna outrun
it. We're just not.

(soft dramatic music)

Annie?

I'm in.

Jodie?

Come on. Help me untie this.

Okay.

Okay. Got it.

(wood splashing)

(hook stabs)
(anchor plops)

(suspenseful music)

(water sloshing)

(suspenseful music)

Wonder if it's gone.

I mean, if it's gone, we
should be going for the island.

Hasn't gone.

How do you know that?

Because it won't.

Jodie's got a point.

If it's not here,
then we should be

paddling for the island, right?

I mean, we're losing time.

Nic, if it comes,
we'll take our positions.

Exactly.

We have to get going
and get help for the...

(suspenseful music)
(water rushing)

Oh my God. It hasn't gone.

(Nic gasping)

Where is it?
I don't know.

I don't know.

Where did it go?


Where the fuck is it?

(water sloshing)

(rope splashing)

(intense music)
(all gasping)

(water rushing)

(rope creaking)

Undo the rope! Undo the rope!

Jodie, undo the rope!

Hold on!
Jodie!

Jodie! Oh fuck!

(intense music)

(water rushing)

Jodie, hurry up!
Jodie, untie it!

Come on!

(machete scraping)

Hurry up!
(machete clinks)

(rope whooshing)

(kayak splashing)

(water sloshing)

Whoo! (laughing)

We did it!

We got it!

We got it.

It worked. It worked.

Oh, we actually got it.

(Annie laughing)

We did.

Yeah.

Wow.

We should paddle.

Yeah, we'll go faster
if we all paddle.

Let's get rid of this.

Yeah, that's a good idea.

(bright music)
(ropes rustling)

(water sloshing)

(Annie chuckles)


Yeah, let's go.

(oars splashing)

We're almost there.
Yeah.

(water splashing)

(suspenseful music)

(water splashing)

(Annie gasping)

(water rushing)

(Nic whimpering)

(water sloshing)

(shark slams)
(Jodie gasps)

(intense music)
(water bubbling)

Jodie!
Jodie!

(Jodie gasping)

Paddle, quick!

Nic, it's coming!

Jodie, go, go!

(water burbling)

Jodie, give me your hand!

That's it.

(intense music)
(water burbling)

Oh!

Pull! Come on!

(Jodie gasping)

You're okay. We've got you.

You okay?

Can you stand?
Uh-huh.

shoulder, it's my shoulder!

All right. Hold it
close to your chest.


All right. Ready?

One, two...

Oh shit.
(Jodie groaning)

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm gonna put your arm in.

I've got you. It's
gonna be okay.

(Jodie groaning)

All right.

Hey.

(Jodie groaning)

Okay.

You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

Yeah?

(Angie panting)

Oh my God.

Shit.

(water sloshing)

Nic, get down.

(suspenseful music)

Where'd it go? (panting)

Where is it?

Oh, it's there. It was there.

Oh my God.

(water burbling)

(intense music)

Oh my God! It's coming!

It's coming, Nic! It's coming!

Shit. Shit.

(Jodie gasping)

Okay, the trap didn't work, we-

(intense music)
(shark thrashing)

(all screaming)

(shark slamming)
(water splashing)

(shark thrashing)

(Nic gasping)

You okay?
Yeah.

You?

Annie, you okay?
Yeah.

Good.

Oh shit. We're filling up.

(suspenseful music)

Where's the bucket?

We're fucking sinking.

How are we gonna
get to the island?

What are we gonna do?

(suspenseful music)

(water splashing)

We're gonna trap
it and drown it.

Yeah.
Okay?

Kill it. Just kill it.

Yeah.

Okay

(suspenseful music)

Hey, help with this.

What are you doing?
I'm gonna trap it

in the net.

Here, tie it. Make
sure it's tied tight.

(intense music)

Grab the net.

When I say throw, you throw.

Hey, no matter what happens,
we get to the island.

Okay?
Okay, what about you?

Don't worry about me.

Nic, what about you?
Just do it!

(intense music)
(water rushing)

Throw! Throw!

(water splashing)

Oh shit!

(shark thrashing)

(Annie yelps)

Annie!

(water bubbling)

Where's the machete?

(machete plops)
Oh shit!

(intense music)

(water bubbling)

(shark chomping)

(Cath gasping and screaming)

(water bubbling)

(intense music)

(shark thrashing)

(water bubbling)

(machete stabbing)
(shark thrashing)

(water bubbling)

(Nic gasping)

Annie. (gasping)

Annie. Annie, please!

Annie! Annie, hey.

(Annie coughing)

Oh my God.

Are you, are you okay?

Yeah.
It's okay.

It's okay. I've got you.

Here we go.

(soft dramatic music)
(Annie cries)

It's okay. It's okay.

(Jodie breathes heavily)

(waves lapping)

(phone ringing)

Oh, it's Demi.

Hello, hi!
Hey, Demi!

How are you?

Good. Really good.

Hey, Demi. How's your leg?

See?

That is gonna be
a beauty of a scar.

Huh, I know. I'm now
known as shark girl.

The girl that...

Oh.
Oh.

Oh.

(waves lapping)

(somber music)

To Cath and Lisa.

You'll always be
with us forever.

Always in our hearts.

(Annie sighs)
