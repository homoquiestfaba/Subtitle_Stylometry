and loyalÂ to Edward, King of England,

to never again bear arms
against him or his... heirs.

So help me God.


Sir Robert, your father
is an oldÂ and valued friend,

a great warrior who saved
my life in the Holy Land.

You fought well for eight years,
but not always on the right side.

I welcome your renewed fealty,
and accept your submission.

Is that all?
[man] Yes, Sire.

Good.

My lords of Scotland,
today you have each pledged fealty to me

as your rightful overlord.

Any lands confiscated during this conflict
will now be returned to you.

See? That wasn't so bad.
[Edward] I hope you see the futility

of your years of opposition,
and accept responsibility

for the bloodshed
that could have been avoided.

Lord John Comyn, Lord Robert Bruce...


have a strong claim on the Scottish crown.

However, neither can be favored.
Therefore,

England will continue to governÂ your
province and receive its due in taxes.

Our viceroy, Sir Aymer de Valence...
Sire.

of Scottish administration.

You both will be proud to serve under him,

and you will take that opportunity,

if you are wise,
to heal the differences between you.

Offer your hands.

Now let us be what we once were...

friends!
[noblemen cheering]

Music! Drink! Feast!

[whispering indistinctly]

[Edward] Rob!
[Bruce Senior] Your Majesty...

a memorable day, Sire.


That must have been painful for you.

I've had worse, Your Highness.

Do you rememberÂ our summers
at Westminster, when I was a little boy?

Our footraces,
dueling with wooden swords.

You were always so good at everything.

That was just because
I was older than you.

What would you say to a duel right now?

Like old times?

And break my oath already?
[chuckles]

The order was to come unarmed,
Your Highness.

Quiet.

Let's say five pounds
to whomever wins leverage.

Let's make it ten.

I heard you'd developed
a taste for wagering.

Piers, fetch him a sword.

[Prince of Wales] It's unfortunate
you hadÂ some sentimental notion

of fighting for the people.
It's understandable.

Whoa!

[crowd laughing]

[man] Not a good start, Bruce.
[man] Watch yourself, brother.

[Prince of Wales] Endearing, even.

[crowd laughing]

I just wanted to win.

So...

William Wallace...

the last rebel standing.

[both laughing]
[man] Well done!

[under his breath] Prick.
How much have you had to drink?

Not nearly enough.


They say he lives in Selkirk Forest.

Some consider him a martyr...

others, a madman.

What do you think?

[breathing heavily]
I think he is a man

who loves his country more than his life.

[Prince of Wales] Diplomatically put.

[Robert sighing wearily]
All right, fortunately,

you Scottish nobles
donâ€™t shareÂ that passion.

[Robert coughs]
Or weâ€™d have to kill you all.





he wishes to see you at once.

[Prince of Wales]Â Shut up,
you sniveling fool!

[man] You're late.
[man] You know how much this means to me.

Please, for once use your brain.
Stay there.

Thank you, Bishop.
I'll see what I can do.

You're the one who was up all night,
clutching your chamber pot!

[all laughing]

What the hell are you doing?

You have responsibilities.
We've had petitioners.

Sit down!

When are you gonna grow up?

Robert insisted we wager on swords.
And I have grown up.

You just donâ€™t like me very much.

Pardon me, Sire.

There is one last petitioner.

James Douglas.


Your Majesty,
I am the son of Sir William Douglas,

who died a prisoner
in the Tower of London.

Your father was a treacherous rebel.

Our lands were seized
and giftedÂ to Sir Richard de Clifford.

Traitors forfeit their lands.
That land, Sire, is my birthright.

You heard my father. Get out.
You have balls, I'llÂ give you that.

Get out of here,

before I have them removed.

Royal decree: I never want to hear
the name Douglas again.

[noblemen laughing]

I know this young man. I baptized him.

Pardon me, Sire, for his insolence.

Go!

Do not push your luck today!
[James] He can't do that!

He slandered my name.

through the eye of a needle.

[Bruce Senior and Edward laughing]

Sire, ready.

Good.

Come! Rob, I have something to show you.

[men shouting indistinctly]

Friends, join us.

We have a spectacle.

[fanfare playing]

Has there not been enough humiliation?

Lord Oliphant tried to surrender
two days ago.

Edward refused to accept.

Wants to be certain we get the message.


[drums beating]

Everyone needs to understand
that this surrender is final.

Light the Greek fire.

Also, it took three months to build,
so I don't want to waste it.

[raised voice] My lords...

and ladies...

I give you...

the War Wolf.

[crowd cheering]

[choir singing a hymn]

Now you can accept the surrender.


Congratulations, my lords.
Today, you're on the winning side.

I'm proud of you, Robert.

You had the courage to stand up to me,

and the wisdom to stand down.

Well done for bringing
your son round, Rob.

[choir singing a hymn]

[crowd clamoring and laughing]

Sir Roger de Mowbray,
fierce steward of the north,

vanquisher of Stirling!
Our thanks!

[crowd cheering]

Finally, Sir Richard de Burgh,
[crowd cheering]

valiant marshal,
loyal servant of the Crown.

[Richard de Burgh] Your Grace.

We give the hand
of your daughter, Elizabeth,

my god-daughter,
to Sir Robert de Brus.

[crowd cheering and laughing]

And may this pairing symbolize
the harmonious union of our two countries.

[crowd cheering and laughing]


Youâ€™ve mourned her long enough, Robert.

Edwardâ€™s intentions were well-meant.

The important thing is we are favored.

This council with Valence...

is a mere formality.

Edward will offer us the crown.

He all but promised me.

Youâ€™d be a lackey.

Yes...

if it meant me being king.

And after me, you.

King Robert.

or be hounded to death. It's that simple.

And you trust Edward's peace, Angus?
I didn't say I trusted him.

What is peace with a sword
to the throat?Â I say we fight...

We swore an oath, Alexander, to God.

If we break it, we'll have no honor left.

And live like cowards?

That's not what I meant...
[yelling] Enough!

Father...

made the decision.

It is ours to bear.

[Richard de Burgh] His family has
vast lands northÂ and south to the border.

You could do a lot worse.

What happened to his first wife?

She died giving birth to his daughter.

Do I have to call her Mother?

No.

I wonder if sheâ€™ll like Jessie.

[Robert chuckles]
Well, sheâ€™d better!

[Robert groans]
[trumpet blares in distance]

Are you ready?

I hear this one's got
two legs for a change.

Heard she smells like Jessie, too.
Quiet!

Hairy old thing.

[Prince ofÂ Wales] Robert.
Your Highness.

My father sends his best.

And you know Bishop Lamberton, of course.

Bishop.
Congratulations, Lord Bruce.

My lord.

[Richard de Burgh] My lord,
my daughter Elizabeth.

My lady.

My lord.

Welcome.

And you must be Marjorie?

[dog whines softly]
And whoâ€™s this handsome fellow?

Our dog, Jessie, my lady.

Call me Elizabeth.

Elizabeth?
Mm-hmm.

[choir singing hymn]

[ceilidh band playing]

My lord, your new estates in Ireland,

from which you will now gather rents.

Most kind, my lord.

What do you think you're doing?
Lord Bruce bid us celebrate in here.

Get back in the kitchen.

Are you enjoying yourself?

Trying to.

Are you?

I'm...

appreciating your honesty.

[Elizabeth chuckles]

My lord.

It's about time
to retire to your bedchamber.

Please, follow me.

[crowd cheering]

Yes, that's it, Bruce!Â Off to bed!

Time to rut! [laughing]

[Lamberton reading prayer in Latin]

Amen.

[Robert]Amen.
[Elizabeth] Amen.

Was this her room?

Yes.

Thank you for enduring
what you had to tonight.

I'm sure it was difficult.

Sleep well.

[door opens and closes]


[door closes]

That was... quick.

plenty about that,Â Seamus.

[humming "Bonny at Morn"]


"Bonny at Morn."

That's pretty.

Thank you.


Taxes for honey!

This way, please.
My lord,

you promised our taxes would be reduced
once the wars with Edward were over.

Aye, I know, Iain.

Sadly, we're still paying Edward
compensation for the rebellion.

Aye.

How are you?
My lady.

[Elizabeth chuckles]

by the horses.Â Everything else over here.

All baskets over that side.

[man] Get out the way!
[man] In the name of the King!



[man] Move yourselves!
I'll handle this, Father.


[panicked cries]

It is our feudal duty to provide fighting
men for our overlord, King Edward.

You assured us
these obligations would be over!

I'd hoped they were.
[woman] Heâ€™s not yet 14!


Stop!

My father is Richard de Burgh,
a senior marshal in your army.

I presume you have heard of him?

I know for a fact he prefers
to command men, not children.

Let him go.

Let him go.


[knock at door]

What you did today was...

brave.

Anything else?

No.

Good night, then.

Good...


[Elizabeth laughing]
[Marjorie laughing and squealing]


gets theseÂ conscription papers

straight away, my lord.

[coughing and wheezing]

Did I ever tell you of the time,
Robert, when I...

went to the Holy Land to fight?

I bought a small monkey on a chain.

Moses, we christened him. [laughs]
[Robert laughs]

All the hours me and King Edward
spent training Moses...

In the end,Â he could ride a horse.

He could even fire a tiny bow and arrow

that Edward himself had fashioned.

Aye.

Edward...

was my friend, Robert.

He was my brother in arms.

But I fear I've made a...

a grave mistake in trusting him.

[exhales heavily]

[exhales heavily]

Father?

Father?

[choir singing mournful hymn]

[singing mournful hymn]

Robert, you just buried your father.

Iâ€™m still obliged
to pay my taxes to our king.

Fresh pies!

Would you like a pie, sir?
[Angus] What do you have, my dear?


Bless you.

Clear the way!

[man in low voice] Bastards!

This yours, little fellow? Eh?
Did you lose something?

[Angus laughs]

Taxes from Carrick.
[man] Thank you, Lord Bruce.

[crowd clamoring angrily]



[girl screams] No!
Bastards!

Go home!
[man] Soldiers! Form a line!

Disperse by order of the King!
[woman] You murderers!

[woman] You murdering bastards!
[Angus] They've killed Wallace.


[soldier yelling] Move back!
[man] Bastards!

Make way in the name of the King!

Move!


Move!

[panicked shouting]

[soldier yelling] Get back!


[Angus] Get back, Robert!
[man] Robert!

[soldier] Beat them back!
[soldier] Disperse!

Get back!

Bastards!


This is for Wallace!


We have to do something here!

They're too strong.



Robert, we have to fight back!


[man] Wallace!
[man] Come on! Robert!


More wine, my lord?
Thank you, Seamus.

Elizabeth, I have to speak to my brothers.

That's fine.
I can hear what you have to say.

Alone.

Seamus, Gayle, Drew.



Good night.

We swore vows on King Edwardâ€™s Bible...

that we will need to break.

Why? What happened?
Wallace is dead.

The people are up in arms.

There can be no peace.

What would Father say?

Father is gone. This is my decision.

But you are my blood.

My family.

I cannot do this without you.

We need to raise an army.

It's crucial we get as many Lords
on our side as possible,

including John Comyn.

[door opens]

but I...

I know you have no need for my counsel.

Itâ€™s true,Â I have seen
very little of the world.

However, a young lady of my standing
is afforded a great deal of time to read,

to form distinct opinions, and...

to draw her own conclusions
about the nature of power.

All right.
Power is making decisions.

Power is not allowing yourself
to beÂ buffeted on the tides of history.

Instead, it is choosing a boat,
climbing aboard, and hoisting the sail.

I choose you.

And whatever course you are charting,

I choose you.

My husband.


Good night.

Good night.

[door opens]

[door closes]

I don't like it.

We can't trust Comyn.




I confess,
I was surprised to receive your letter.

â€œI do urgently desire to discuss with you
a matter most delicate.â€

It's a bit cryptic, wouldnâ€™t you say?

It was intentional.

I see.

And if I were to infer that your aim
was in fact to reignite a rebellion...

We already tried it.

For eight bloody years.
And we failed.

Because we didnâ€™t unite.

No, because your family

were too busy trying to claim
a crown that wasnâ€™t theirs.

Are you saying you wish
to relinquish that claim?

Iâ€™m saying we need to set aside
our rivalry and win back our country.

Then we can decide
who wears the crown. <i>Us.</i>

Not Edward.

John, between us,
we couldÂ raise 20,000 men.

We could have a fighting chance.
Itâ€™ll never work.

The people are tired of war and suffering.

Wallace was tortured and slaughtered.
The people aren't tired,

they are desperate for justice.

Wallace got what he deserved.

He wasnâ€™t a man, he was an idea.

A destructive and dangerous idea.

Almost as dangerous
as the idea youâ€™re proposing.

You Bruces are all the same.

John...
Youâ€™re not worthy of our country.

And I swear Iâ€™ll do whatever it takes
to keep you from being its king.

And once I explain to Edward
the meaningÂ of your furtive letter to me,

heâ€™ll place a noose over your head...

and Scotlandâ€™s crown upon mine.

[Comyn grunts]

[Comyn choking]


[Comyn panting]

[wind whistles]

You had no other choice, Robert.

We have to tell Lamberton.
I'm a damned man now.

at least we stand a chance.</i>

as the Pope will surely demand.</i>


If we disown him now,
we remain at the mercy of Edward.

The survival
of the Scottish church is at stake.

No one is arguing that,
but you are asking us

to support a murderer.

The answer is clear, is it not?

[approaching footsteps]


And I will absolve you
for the murder of John Comyn.

If you vow to support the Church,

we will support
your inauguration as our king.

It must be done quickly. In Scone.

Scone may be dangerous.

Itâ€™s next to the English garrison
at Perth.

For the people, it must be Scone.
We need legitimacy,

particularly now.

Scone it is.


[door closes]

Slaying his rival on sacred ground.
Itâ€™s lunacy!

I knew he detested John Comyn,
but I never thought he'd go this far.

He'll have himself crowned king
before the Pope can excommunicate him.

King? Robert? You think he would dare?

Yes.

[Prince of Wales]
Put me in charge of this.

I know you think me incompetent, Father,

but I am to be king...
[Edward] Hm.

...one day. Let this be a test.

What would you do, son?

I would raise the dragon, Father.

Get word to Valence.

Robert the Bruce to be declared an outlaw.

Any man or woman who would give shelter
to him or any of his ranks

to be executed without trial.

My son will raise the dragon banner.

The codes of chivalry are ended.
There will be no quarter.

Your recklessness
is going to getÂ us all killed!

Not if we stand side by side.
The bishops absolved him.

Surely you can do the same.
Itâ€™s not as simple as that.

Why is it not as simple as that?
Because we promised our people peace!


We had no choice because we had
no one to lead us.

Perhaps now we do.

The Comyns
and the Balliols will never swallow that.

[mocking laughter]

The Balliols have had their chance.

Think about what you're doing here.
It's time for change.

Malcolm.


Robert... I'm with you.



[Elizabeth sighs]

We must be careful on the road to Scone.

We have enemies on all sides now.

I am sorry...

for bringing you into this.

I understand.

And I know my duty.

Hm.

Thank you.

I'll be with you the whole time.


Please, can we take him?
We can't. I'm sorry.

Seamus here will take good care of him.
Please.

Let's move out.


Just be ready.

What is your business?

Halt.

I said halt!


I am James, son of William Douglas
of Douglasdale.

I recognize your father in you.

I've come to pledge myself
to you as your defender.

He could be a spy,

loyal to Comyn, perhaps,
or even Edward.

What is it you actually want?

I want what Edward stole
from my father and me.

I want my land back.

I want my name back.

Now, you give me that,

I will be loyal to you forever.

I killed John Comyn at the altar.

You should knowÂ the man
to whom youâ€™re offering loyalty.

Are you a good man?

Iâ€™m trying to be.

Thatâ€™s good enough for me.


You can bring up the rear.

Let this blow be
the last you receive unanswered.

Next.

by every Scottish king

has been stolen by the English King.

So, too, our ancient coronation stone

and yet remains in Scotland a little gold
and good men to work it.

We have a crown.

We have a king to wear it.
Praise be to God.

I inaugurate you,

Robert Bruce, son of Robert Bruce,
son of Robert Bruce,

son of Isabella Huntingdon,
daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon,

son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon,

son of David, King of Scots.

God bless the King of Scots.


Your Majesty.

[choir singing hymn]

[bishop reciting blessing in Latin]

I wear this crown

as a symbol of my duty
to serve the Scottish people.

My title is King of Scots.

Not of the land, but of the people.


I vow to avenge
this murderous insult to God!

[crowd cheering]

I hereby pledge my undying fealty

to Robert Bruce, King of Scots.

Thank you, my lord.

[Robert chuckles]

Scrymgeour, you have hands like rocks.

These are paws. My father was a bear.


I, too, pledge my undying fealty.

Valence's men are assembling in Perth.

And now the real test begins.

Aye...

Your Majesty.

You were wise to join us.

That murderer is no king of mine.

Nor anyoneâ€™s much longer.
The Prince and his envoy are on their way,

unbound by the shackles of chivalry.

Theyâ€™re flying the dragon banner.

[panicked shouting]

As King of Scots,
I speak for our sovereign nation.

I demand that you return
our castle at Perth.

I demand that you return to your homeland.

â€œKing of Scots.â€

You murdered my brother-in-law

and made my sister a widow.

I look forward to this fight.

We can resolve this conflict
by fighting one-on-one.

Now.

I accept.

But today is a Sunday.

I know you donâ€™t much respect
holy matters, but I do.

Tomorrow then.

Tomorrow then.

That wasn't the plan, Robert.

The man's a bloody beast.
Are you sure this is a good idea?

I can handle myself.

And what happens if he kills you?

Shouldnâ€™t you wait for the Prince?

The Prince has served his purpose
by raising the dragon banner.

Are you sure that's a good idea?

The King has made it clear
that we must do whatever it takes.

We are dealing with outlaws, man.
They have no rights.

[flute playing]

[man laughs]
[man groans]

everyone's money again,Â Archibald?

You fancy a game of knucklebone, Sire?

Perhaps later. Go easy on them.

[man] You arsehole.
[men laugh]

Did you get them, Drew?

Yes, Sire.

Good man.

I couldn't find any decent goblets.

Nor any decent wine.
No. [laughs]

[Elizabeth laughs]

[Robert sighs]

Alas, we are but King
and Queen of the May.

And tomorrow will come
to strip us of our crowns.

No.

We have too much work to do
to let that happen now.

"We"?

We.

[Elizabeth gasps]

[both laugh]

[Elizabeth laughs]

[Robert sighs heavily]

[both breathing heavily]

[Elizabeth moans and breathes heavily]

[Elizabeth sings lullaby]
<i>â™ª The sheep is in the meadow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the kye is in the corn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thou's ower lang in thy bed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bonny at morn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Canny at night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bonny at morn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Thou's ower lang in thy bed â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Bonny at morn â™ª</i>

[whispering] If I die tomorrow...
No. I wonâ€™t speak of it...

If I die tomorrow...

you are Marjorieâ€™s and she is yours.

Do whatever you must.

Do you understand?

[wood splintering outside]

What is it? Robert?

[Angus screams] Ambush!


Now, come!
[Elizabeth] Marjorie, up.

[Marjorie] What's happening?
Up. Go.

Go! Get down!
[Marjorie screaming]

[Elizabeth] Marjorie, hold on.
[Robert] Down!

[screaming and clamoring]

[Robert] Neil! Now, go!
[Neil] I'm with you, Robert.

Take them to the horses, go!

Loose!

[screaming and clamoring]

Come on, I need you to run!


Foot soldiers.

[foot soldiers screamingÂ and clamoring]

Atholl men, on me!

[Atholl clansman] Come on, you bastards!

Take them to Kildrummy.
Lord Fraser's a friend.

Donâ€™t worry, brother.
Theyâ€™ll be safe with me.

[Neil] Come on.
Lord Fraser will take you to France.

I want you to take me. No.


You take us. Daddy, please.
Be brave. I love you.

Come on, Marjorie, let's go.
[Robert] Look after each other.

[Marjorie] No! You can come!
[Elizabeth] Marjorie.

[Neil] Come. Quickly.
[Robert] I'll come find you.

[Marjorie whimpering] Daddy!

Charge!



[James screams] Douglas!

Douglas!


Retreat! Pull back!

John!

Go! Go!

[Angus] Move! Get him out of here!
[man] Go! Run!


Kill all the prisoners.

Let the Scots see what comes of pledging
fealty to their new "king."

[soldier] On your knees!
[man] What about Atholl? He is an earl.



The king will hang him for treason.

And, Percy, spread word.

Gold to those who lead us
to Robert the Bruce.

[Marjorie crying]

Perhaps you should say
a few words to the men.

And say what?

Let's get these men on the horses.

Here, Duncan. Come here.

[John groans in pain]

Thank you.

We can go to Islay, to my home.

Itâ€™s so remote, no one will think
to look for you there.

We can enlist the islanders.
Replenish our ranks.

Robert?

What do you think?

We don't have a choice, do we?

Fifty men to fight
the strongest army in the world.



Have you come to join us?

And why would we be wanting to do that?

No more taxes for Edward's pocket.

No more good men
dying in wars not of their making.

We can unite Scotland.

We could win her back.

Youâ€™ve got nerve, Bruce,
Iâ€™ll give you that.

Comyn was my cousin.

Youâ€™re no king of ours.



[Lord Fraser] Your Majesty.

Follow me.

Welcome to Kildrummy.

You know, Marjorie,
your mother grew up here.

You can have her bedroom. [chuckles]
[Marjorie giggles]


[soldier] Hang the bastards!
[villagers screaming and clamoring]

[Prince of Wales] This is what you get
for supporting Robert the Bruce!

We go south,
we run into Valence's men.

And north,
we go back into MacDougall land.

If we take the boats across this loch,

the other side of that hill
is the coast to Islay.

Ah, it's a wonderful idea
in theory,Â Douglas,

but there's more hole than boat.

This boat's good.

We can't leave the horses.

We don't need horses, we need men.

Euan, gather provisionsÂ as you can.

James, put the horses in the forest.
Alexander, you come with me.

We need as many men
on that boat as we can.

Hamish, John.
[James] Horses in the forest now!


Weâ€™ll be back for you.

and follow me into the woods.


It's too small.

[Robert shouts] Angus!

Look! MacDougalls!

[indistinct yelling]


[James] Into the boats!
[Euan] MacDougall!


Bruce's men!

Hold the line!

[MacDougall soldier]
Die, you Bruce bastard!

[man] To the boat!
Quickly!


Get on the boat!


Come here. I've got you.


Alex?

[Angus screams] No! No!

Alex!

No!

No!

We need the space!

[Euan screams indistinctly]



Douglas! Come here!

Get on!

Row!
Row!


Valence.

You failed to wait for me.

You attacked by night,
you had the upper hand,

you had the element of surprise,
and yet you lost him.

The battle was a success.

We crushed them mercilessly.

A few managed to escape.

Including the Bruce!

Your aim, <i>our </i>aim,

was to capture him, and you failed!

My scouts are searching for him,
Your Highness.

And a reward has been offered.

It will be <i>your </i>head if he's not found.

[Prince of Wales] Lord Buchan.
Your Highness.

You bring news of the Bruce?

No, Your Highness,
his wife and child.

Marjorie, we've been riding
horses for days. Are you not tired yet?

[women laugh]
No.

[door opens abruptly]

English soldiers approaching,
we have to go now.

Get to the trees,
I'll send horses and men. Go.

Lord Fraser!

We know you have
the Bruceâ€™s wife and child.

Hand them over and I spare the castle!

[commander of archers] Draw!

They are not here, Your Royal Highness.

[commander of archers] Loose!


[Lord Fraser]
Thereâ€™s no need to burn us down.

I will open the gate.

[Prince of Wales] Neil, where's Robert?


Where are his wife and daughter?

They left for Turnberry on Tuesday.

They left for Turnberry on Tuesday?

[Marjorie] Ow!
[Elizabeth whimpering]


Where is your brother?

I swear I don't know.

I swear I don't know!

[Marjorie] Uncle Neil!
I swear!

You forced my hand, Neil.
[Marjorie] Elizabeth!

[Neil] I swear!
[Elizabeth] Let him go!

[Neil] I swear I don't know!
[Marjorie] What are they doing?

No, please. I swear.
[Marjorie] Uncle Neil!

[Elizabeth sobbing] No! No!

[Marjorie crying]




[Marjorie crying and screaming]

No! Stop!

No, Neil!

Where is your husband?


We donâ€™t know.

Please, have mercy.
Your father is a tyrant, you are not.

You think me weak?

Compassion is not weakness.

I have all the traits my father has,
save one:

mercy.

Fraser.

You seem like a...

reasonable man.

Where's the Bruce?

I truly donâ€™t know.

[blade slicing]

[Marjorie screams and cries]

Hang them both up

for all to see what becomesÂ of those
who support the outlaw Bruce.

Take the women to England,
seize all his lands.

Leave him with nothing.

[woman screams]

[screaming and clamoring]

[indistinct chatter]

See you later. [chuckles]


[Marjorie whimpers]


I heard a rumor you made yourself king,

and the Prince is tearing Scotland
apart looking for you.

I've come to ask for your support.

[Lord Mackinnon] My men and I
stood with Wallace at Falkirk.

Where were you then?

You know that.

How can I follow a man
who's never won an open battle?

From what I've been told,
you barely escaped Methven alive.

We were ambushed in the dead of night.

How many men have you?

Forty.

I'm still rounding people up.

I wish you luck. I truly do.

Come on, Lachlan!
I've known you for over 25 years.

Now just please, give us some people...
Angus!

[Euan] We've come here for your help.
Are you done?

I believe, in time,
you'll change your mind.

And I'll be waiting.

Move.

Hamish, how you doing?

How you doing, boy?

My darling! [grunts]

Where the fuck have you been?

You said three weeks,
itâ€™s been four months!

Much has happened, my love.

Oh, Angus.

[both laughing]

[Angus laughs]
[woman squeals and giggles]

Maybe I'll see you later, then.
Sure.


Our new king.

Aye.

Welcome, Your Majesty.

It's good to see you again, Aine.

Come! Letâ€™s get you warm and fed.

<i>â™ª There is â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A blackbird â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sits on yon tree â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Some say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It is blind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cannae see â™ª</i>

One man to down the horse.

And one man to remove the knight.

And then to kill him.

Weak spots under the arm,

the neck... On your feet.
And in the groin.


You go near my daughter again,
I'll cut them off and use them as bait.

Are we clear?

What you doing, you bastard?


I'll kick your bloody arse, Douglas, eh?
[James] You taste sweeter!

[Angus] You think that's bloody funny?
[Robert laughs]

Right. Who's next?

[door opens]

[Elizabeth sighs]


to our convent for religious training.

Only the girl.

Oh.

Isn't that wonderful?

The sisters want to look after you.

And they are gonna take
such good care of you.

Come, child.

Are you coming?

No.

No, but...

we'll all be home again soon.

I'm certain of it.

And Father?

Mm-hmm.

Come on. Come here.

No.
Come on, Marjorie.

Please, don't make this hard.

No, I don't want to go! No!

Marjorie, I'll see you soon. I promise.

I love you.

No, I want to go back!
I love you.

You'll be fine.
[Marjorie] Let go!

No. Elizabeth!
Let go of me! Elizabeth!

[women of Islay singing in Gaelic]

Your Grace.

Angus's other daughter.

Oh, here he comes.
This could get interesting.

[Robert laughs]

Kildrummyâ€™s fallen.

Every man massacred.

Your brother was hanged,
drawn and quartered.

My wife? My daughter?

Theyâ€™re both alive.

Taken by the Prince.

We have to go back.

[breathing heavily]

You wanted to be king.

Well, you're king now.

This is the price you pay.

We only win if you survive.

Thinking about revenge?

I know the feeling.

It tears at the soul.

But it can also be a weapon.

No more chivalry.

Now we fight like wolves.


You know him?
Aye.

Come on, James.

Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Lord Bruce.

Your Majesty.

Your Majesty.

Iain.


Where have you been?

Took an age to fix it.


Letâ€™s unload this
before they gut the both of us.

[soldier shouts the alarm]


What've you got in there?

Porridge.
Oh...

I'll have some of that, then.

Come on, get me a bowl.

Of course.

[James roars]
[screams]



Die, you bastard!

To the stairs! Follow me!



Seamus. Are you all right?

Your Majesty! Itâ€™s good to have you home.

We canâ€™t stay.
Theyâ€™ll know where we are.

Youâ€™re all to come with us.
Aye.

We take what we can, and burn it down.

[Seamus] Gayle!
[Robert] Leave nothing for the enemy.


This is how we do it.

We travel in stealth.

Strike without warning.

Take the land back castle by castle,
destroying them as we go.

Itâ€™s not exactly chivalry, but I like it.

Burn it all and take what you can!


Robert, you know,
my fatherâ€™s land is only a dayâ€™s ride.

It would mean so much to me
if I could take it myself.

You know, Iâ€™d only need two or three men.

Take five.

And keep your wits about you.

I've already lost two brothers,
I can't bear to lose another.

Everyone out!

Good luck, boy.

[church bell ringing]

[woman shrieks]


[church bell ringing]

[priest chanting]Â <i>Alleluia!</i>

[congregation chanting]

[congregation chanting louder]
<i>Alleluia!</i>


[congregation screaming in panic]


I watched once, from that very window,

my mother and father standing
in this courtyard.

And my father whispering
in my motherâ€™s ear.

I donâ€™t know what he said,
but it must have been funny because she...


I used to drink this water.

Poison it.
Throw the bastards down the well.

Whereâ€™s that cunt Clifford?


Well, then, Iâ€™ll see him soon enough.

Friends, don't be afraid. Please join me.

[prisoner screams] No!

Come, enjoy this Palm Sunday feast.

It was prepared for your enemies.

It is yours now.

As is everything in my familyâ€™s castle.

I serve Robert Bruce, King of Scots!

Join us to free our land!

[crowd cheers loudly]

Sir Richard's castle
in Scotland has also fallen.

The man responsible may have been mad.

He was heard screaming
the same word over and over.

Douglas.

He claimed to be fighting
for Robert the Bruce.

The outlaws continue
to sack their own castles,

and as word of Bruce's exploits spreads,
so does his support amongst the people.

Of course, there are still nobles
who remain loyal to the Crown.

This morning...

I woke up...

performed my ablutions,

and then walked
from my bedchamber to the great hall.

And on the way, I stumbled.

No reason, just...

just lost my footing.

Well, I lose my footing sometimes.

Especially in the morning
when the body is still waking up.

It was my hope to grow old

and not die on the battlefield.

But I see now

that the great danger
in a deathÂ from natural causes

is that one may
be lying in one's bedchamber,

thinking of all the things

that have been left undone.

Fear not, Father.
We will not fail you again.

Well, you managed to imprison a few women.

These gentlemen of France
were in the dungeon. They wish to join us.

[speaking French]

[speaking French]


Youâ€™re the King of Scots?

He certainly is, you cheeky wee shite.

Hey.

Go tell all your friends
weâ€™re going to win our country back.

Aye, Sire. Come on, Arthur.



Drew!
[Drew] Your Majesty.

[Angus] Good to have you back!
[man] We found them on the road.



I have something for you, Sire.

I managed to take it from Methven.

Rise.

You look after this for me.

Youâ€™ve done a grand job so far.

I'll guard it with my life.

It's good to have you back.

[Elizabeth breathes heavily]

[Elizabeth sobbing]
[woman gasps]

It's all right.

All's well, Elizabeth.

[Elizabeth sobbing] You're here!

[Elizabeth laughs and cries]
[woman] It's all right. We missed you.

[door opens abruptly]

Elizabeth.

[Elizabeth breathes heavily]

Be calm.

Be strong. Look at me.Â Look at me.
Look at me.

I have known you all my life.

Now, my father is only
granting you this chance

because you are his goddaughter.
Is that understood?

We are very grateful...
Margaret.

[whispers indistinctly]

Now, Elizabeth,
you are to renounce the title of Queen,

and the marriage will be annulled.

Uh...

Sign.

Your pitiful union is a charade.

[Elizabeth moans] Oh...

[whimpers and sobs]


You're doing the right thing.
Do not weep.


[Prince of Wales] Come now.

Robert will soon be dead,
and you can go home to your family.

If he will soon be dead, then why...

why force me to forsake him?


He's continuing to evade you...

isn't he?

[sniffles and laughs]

[Elizabeth screams]

Why do you laugh at me?

I have been kind!

I have given you this opportunity
to redeem yourself!

Now sign it!


Elizabeth...
Take the quill in your hand. Now sign.

Sign.
Sign.

I cannot.

Guards.

[Richard] No, no, no. No, my lord...
[Margaret] Elizabeth...

[guard] Come on!
[Richard] No!

[Elizabeth sobbing]

No! No!

[guard] Lower her down.
[Elizabeth crying desperately]

Wait, wait, wait!


Itâ€™s time to come out in the open.

Their army. Our army.

Aye.

Theyâ€™ll destroy us.

We've no chance against their cavalry.


If we try and face them head on,

in an open battlefield,
theyâ€™ll be riding straight towards you.

Let them.

Weâ€™ll be ready.

We'll be like the spider and its web.

Best to wait, Robert,

gather our strength.
No.

I'm done with running,
and Iâ€™m sick of hiding.

We'll provoke them
until they come after us.

castle at Lochmaben

by Robert the Bruce...

and 50 men.

[Robert's army singing Gaelic ballad]

Go ahead.


[soldier] The King!
[soldier] Halt!

[Edward groaning]

If I die, you are to boil my body
and carry my bones

into every battle...

with the Scots,
until Robert the Bruceâ€™sÂ head

is on an English spike.
You understand?

With pleasure, Father.

Promise me.

I promise.

[Edward inhales sharply]

Do you know...

I have never been able to imagine
you leading an army into battle...

[Edward groans]

...driving your horse forward
to the sound of the drum,

risking your life
for the honor of the English crown...


Do you remember, Father,

when I was a boy...

and you would beat me?

I never cried
because I knew it scared you.

The thought that I was stronger than you.

And the truth is...

I am.

I always have been.

And soon, the whole world will know that.

Iâ€™ll make sure of it.

[Edward rasps and exhales steadily]

Bury him here.

Shouldn't we honor his wishes?

No.

You should honor mine.

Onward to Scotland!

Looks like you've got your fight, Robert.

Go back to your home!


They would take our land.

But they donâ€™t know our land.

Here. This is the place.

Good length.

Aye, that should do.

Take them over there. Sharpen them up.

My mother says you have to return it.

Oh, I promise I will.

I've a daughter your age.
I'm sure she'd like you.

Where is she?

I wish I knew.

[men sing]
<i>â™ª Sometimes they call me James â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Singing didy-i-o, sing fal-a-do â™ª</i>

Come on.

Wait until you try my black pudding, boys.


[Prince of Wales] Halt!

Halt!

This gauntlet...

belongs to Robert the Bruce,
King of Scots.

Now, you see that hill over there?

It's Loudoun Hill.

Weâ€™ll fight you under it tomorrow.

These people.

[soldiers chanting]

Seems itâ€™s better for us both
if this battle were to end swiftly.

It will.

With 3,000 mounted soldiers.

Yes. My portion of whom
are to have a single aim...

the man whom you failed to capture.

[woman singing in Gaelic]



We cannot match their strength...

so we will not even try.

We leave the horses behind,

and use the land to our advantage.

At all costs, we hold the center ground,

and we force them to the flanks.

Simple.

[laughs wryly]

God willing, that will be enough.

Your Majesty.

Forgive me.

I should never have doubted you.

How many men have you?

We have 40.

You're here now.

That's all that matters.

Thank you.

Join us, please.

You heard King Edward
did not surviveÂ the journey?

Aye. His sonÂ may be
the more dangerous enemy.

Here, eat.

[Elizabeth sings
the Lord's Prayer in Latin]

<i>â™ª Amen â™ª</i>

[blows sharply]

[horns and drums beating]

[horns and drums beating continue]

[forceful drum beating]

Remember this!

The men that we fight today

have sworn fealty to a godless murderer!

[English army yelling angrily]

Make no mistake,

his aim will be to take our England next!

[English army yelling in the distance]

I could talk about God,

but he has no place where we are going.

I could talk about honor,

but you are here.

You know enough about honor.

I know you all as men,

but today...

today, we are beasts.

If you fight for God, for honor,
for country, for family,

for yourselves, I do not care,
so long as you fight!

[Robert's army cheering]

Take the day!


Hold!

Now!

Move!

[Angus] Down!
Pikes ready!

Ready! Now!

It's a trap!

Archers!
[James] Loose!


Forward! Forward!


Move right! Use the flanks!

Follow me!


What is he doing?

What is he doing?

Valence!

Any way you can!

Avoid the bog!
[soldier] It's too deep!

Come on!

Clifford!

Know who I am?

What's my fucking name?

Douglas.

Yes!

[commander of archers] Loose!

Bruce! You bastard!

Charge!

Find the Bruce!

Go around the bogs!

We're stuck!

Keep formation!

Solid ground here!



Riders in the center!

[screams wildly]

[gasps for breath]

Retreat!

Retreat! There's no winning here!

[English soldier] Retreat!


[English soldier] Retreat!

Retreat!

[Robert's army cheering]


[Prince of Wales] Robert!

[Prince of Wales grunts and groans]


[sobbing hysterically]


Help!


[Prince of Wales] Help!

Help me!



[Prince of Wales wails in despair]

Help!

[Robert's army cheering]

Where's Marjorie?

She's waiting for you.
[laughs]

Welcome home, Your Majesty.

I brought you something.

[both laughing]

My Queen.
