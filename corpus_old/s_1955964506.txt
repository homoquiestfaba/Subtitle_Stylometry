Jimmy:
WELL, THIS IS A BIT SURREAL.

Tommy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

Jimmy: YOU KNOW,
ALL THIS STUFF--

"MEET ME IN PARKING LEVEL 6,

COME ALONE,
LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE."

IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D THINK I SHOULD BE WORRIED.

Tommy:
YOU WATCH TOO MANY MOVIES.

THIS WAY.

WE CAN DO
OUR BUSINESS OUT HERE.

NO REASON NOT TO ENJOY
THE OCEAN, COOL BREEZE.

Jimmy: WOW, THIS IS SOME
NICE VIEW YOU GOT HERE, TOMMY.

Man: THANKS. THERE'S
A LOT WRONG WITH THIS CITY--

TOO MUCH TRAFFIC,
TOO MUCH POLLUTION,

OVERPOPULATION--

BUT THE ONE THING
THAT MAKES IT ALL BEARABLE

IS TO COME HOME
AT THE END OF THE DAY

AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

Jimmy: I'M SORRY.
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET.

Man: I'M ALEX BRANDT.

Jimmy: MR. BRANDT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL IN RIO.

Alex: I GOT TIRED OF BEING
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

Jimmy: I MEAN IT'S A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

Alex: MY ASSOCIATES
HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOU.

THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE DONE
SOME GOOD WORK FOR ME.

Jimmy: I TRY.

Alex: I KNOW YOU'RE HERE
TO FILL TOMMY IN

ON SOME DETAILS OF A DEAL
THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON.

Jimmy: YES, SIR.

THERE'S A LARGE SHIPMENT
THAT SOME PEOPLE I KNOW

NEED TO UNLOAD QUICKLY.

NOW, I'VE
NEGOTIATED THEM DOWN

TO SELL THE PRODUCT
BELOW MARKET VALUE.

Alex: MY BOYS
HAVE VOUCHED FOR YOU.

I'M IN ON THE DEAL.

Jimmy: GREAT.

Alex:
TOMMY WILL LOOK AFTER YOU.

ONE THING, JIMMY.

Jimmy: YES, MR. BRANDT?

Alex: WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT PHIL RAPHAELSON?

I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED

A RELATIONSHIP
WITH MR. RAPHAELSON,

AND I GUESS I GET
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE

WHEN ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES
STRIKES UP A CHUMMY RELATIONSHIP

WITH THE PROSECUTOR.

Jimmy: MR. BRANDT, I ASSURE YOU
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON.

Alex: SO THE INFORMATION
I RECEIVED IN BRAZIL

THAT YOU HAD CUT A DEAL WITH
THE PROSECUTOR IS INCORRECT?

Jimmy: THEY TRIED TO PINCH ME,
BUT THEY HAD NOTHING.

NO DEAL WAS MADE.

Alex: AND IF I WERE
TO CHECK YOU FOR A WIRE?

Jimmy: I'D BE CLEAN.

Alex: WOULD YOU MIND
IF TOMMY CHECKED YOU?

Jimmy: NO. GO RIGHT AHEAD.

Alex: VERY GOOD.
YOU HAVE A LOT TO DO.

TOMMY WILL LOOK AFTER YOU.

YEAH, I'M BACK
IN THE COUNTRY.

HOW DO WE GET
THIS PROSECUTOR,

THIS PHIL RAPHAELSON,
TO CALL OFF HIS DOGS?

I DON'T KNOW.

BE CREATIVE.
THINK OF SOMETHING.

HE-- HE'S GOTTA
GET THE POINT.

NO, NO, NO.
TOMMY'S TAKING CARE OF THAT.


YEAH, JIMMY'S
NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

Frank: HEY, PHIL.

Phil: THANKS FOR
COMING SO QUICKLY, FRANK.

Frank: WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S THE STORY?

Phil: WELL, THE NEIGHBOR
CALLED THIS BODY IN

ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT
THE MURDER TOOK PLACE HERE.

Frank: IT'S A BODY DROP.

ISOLATED AREA.
NO TIRE TRACKS.

PRETTY CLEAN.
LOOKS PROFESSIONAL.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEYS

USUALLY AREN'T CALLED IN
ON A CRIME SCENE,

SO I ASSUME YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM, RIGHT?

Phil: YES, I DO.

Frank: WHO IS HE?

Phil: NAME'S JIMMY COSTON.

WE HAULED HIM IN FOR
RACKETEERING A FEW MONTHS BACK.

THE MOMENT I THREATENED HIM
WITH SOME JAIL TIME,

HE JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO START
WORKING FOR ME AS AN INFORMANT.

Frank: WHO'D HE WORK FOR?

Phil: ALEX BRANDT.

Frank: HE TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT BRANDT?

Phil: NOTHING
WE DIDN'T KNOW ALREADY.

WE WERE WORKING ON SOMETHING
TO NAIL BRANDT.

THERE WAS A DEAL
ABOUT TO GO DOWN,

AND BRANDT WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

Frank: OH. MAYBE BRANDT
FIGURED OUT SOMETHING WAS UP.

THAT'D BE MY GUESS.

Phil: WE GOT A REPORT

THAT BRANDT ARRIVED BACK
IN THE COUNTRY A FEW DAYS AGO,

AND THIS
COULD BE OUR CHANCE

TO NAIL HIM
ONCE AND FOR ALL, FRANK.

BUT WE GOTTA MOVE FAST BEFORE HE
TRIES TO FLEE THE COUNTRY AGAIN.

CAN I COUNT
ON CSA's COOPERATION?

Frank: LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

Frank: ALL RIGHT.

Marvin: THIS CAME IN FROM
OUR BRAZILIAN FEED THIS MORNING.

IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH.

Alex: I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT KIND OF MONEY.

YOU KNOW,
ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION.

Man: ALEXEI ALEXANDERVICH...

NOW THAT PLANS ARE FINAL.
WE NEED A WAY TO SECURE FUNDS.

Alex: YOU'RE RIGHT.

I'LL FINALIZE
THE DETAILS TOMORROW.

Man: FRESH START READY TO BREAK
GROUND ON THE SITE RIGHT AWAY.

Marvin: FRESH START?

Frank: FRESH START
CONSTRUCTION.

THAT'S RAY JACKSON'S
COMPANY.

THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

TIME TO SADDLE UP.

Frank: FAST EDDIE BAUTISTA--

STRONG-ARM ROBBERY,
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

DOESN'T LOOK THAT TOUGH.

MIKE "THE MACK" MITCHELL--

EXTORTION,
FRAUD, EMBEZZLEMENT.

NICE GUY.

ALL RIGHT, HERE'S OUR BOY
RIGHT HERE.

YOU'RE WITH ME, MARV?

Marvin:
I GOT YOU 5 BY 5. OVER.

Frank: RAY JACKSON.
THAT'S HIM.

I'D READ YOU HIS RAP SHEET,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

I'M GOING IN.
WISH ME LUCK.

Man: BUILDING #5, ALL RIGHT?

WE GOTTA HAVE A GOOD DAY.

Eddie: OK, WE HAVE
14 TRACTORS, 14 TRUCKS.

WE'RE GONNA WORK
ON THE FOUNDATION,

WE'RE GONNA
LEVEL THE FIELD--

Frank: HEY, EDDIE.

Eddie: HEY.

Frank: MORNING, RAY.

Ray: FRANK DARNELL.
WHAT'S WITH THE GETUP?

CSA FINALLY
HAD ENOUGH OF YOU?

Frank: NAH,
THEY STILL PUT UP WITH ME.

Eddie: HEY! IT'S THE COPS!

Frank: QUITE A SETUP
YOU GOT HERE. I'M IMPRESSED.

Ray: YOU MOVED IN HERE
PRETTY SLICK.

I'M IMPRESSED.

Frank: SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON, RAY?

Ray: YOU TELL ME.

YOU COME IN HERE,

ROUST ME
IN FRONT OF MY BOYS.

HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DO THAT
AND WALK AWAY IN ONE PIECE?

Frank: ALL YOUR BOYS HERE
ARE ON PAROLE, RIGHT?

I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYBODY HERE

THAT WANTS TO PICK UP
A VIOLATION

FOR INTERFERING
WITH A FEDERAL OFFICER.

IT'D BE KIND OF STUPID,
DON'T YOU THINK?

MEET MY BOYS.

Ray: HA HA HA!

Agent: DON'T MOVE, EDDIE!

Man: FREEZE!

Woman: FREEZE!

Man: KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!

Frank: IT'S YOUR CALL.

Ray: NOT BAD, G-MAN.
NOT BAD.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Kathy: POWERBAR. IS THAT
YOUR DEFINITION OF BREAKFAST?

Susan: I'M IN A HURRY. WE HAVE
A PEP ASSEMBLY FIRST PERIOD.

OH, AND I WON'T BE HOME
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

I'M MEETING SOME FRIENDS
AT THE MALL.

Kathy: DO THESE FRIENDS
HAVE NAMES?

Susan: WELL, JENNA AND MADISON
AND MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE.

Kathy: MAYBE'S
NOT GOOD ENOUGH, SUSIE Q.

Susan: MOM, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE LIKES ME.

Kathy: CALL ME.

Kathy: LOVE YA!

UHH! UHH!

Phil: GET THOSE PAPERS TO MY
ASSISTANT BY TOMORROW MORNING.

Caroline: WISH ME LUCK.

Phil: YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW.

YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

Caroline:
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

I NEED TO DO THIS
FOR MYSELF,

AND I WANT TO LOOK MY BEST
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

Phil: WELL,
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,

BUT YOU KNOW
YOU'RE PERFECT TO ME.

Caroline: THANK YOU.

[INMATES YELLING AND TALKING]


Guard: ON YOUR FEET,
CUPCAKE.

Guard: GET YOUR EYES OFF ME,
CONVICT.

Frank: MORNING, RAY?
YOU SLEEP WELL?

Ray: WHY SHOULDN'T I?
I GOT A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.

Frank: THAT MAKES ONE OF US.

Ray: YOU COME TO APOLOGIZE
AND SEND ME HOME?

Frank: THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I'M HERE.

HOW DID YOU KNOW?

Phil: I'M HERE
TO OFFER YOU A CARROT,

A CHANCE
TO GET OUT FROM UNDER

BEFORE I FILE INTERNATIONAL
MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES,

AND I SUGGEST YOU TAKE
FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT.

Ray: AND IF I DON'T?

Frank:
RAY, I'D BET MY PENSION

THAT YOU'RE LAUNDERING MONEY
FOR ALEX BRANDT.

I'VE BEEN CHASING THIS GUY
AROUND THE PLANET

FOR ABOUT THE PAST 3 YEARS

AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'M GONNA
LET THE TRAIL STOP WITH YOU.

RAY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

WHAT HAPPENS
WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY?

Ray: ENLIGHTEN ME, PLEASE.

Frank: RAY, THAT MONEY
GOES TO FUND

SOME OF THE MOST RADICAL
TERRORIST GROUPS IN THE WORLD,

NOT TO MENTION SOME VERY PROMINENT
ENEMIES OF THIS COUNTRY.

WE INTERCEPTED A TRANSMISSION
FROM A SOURCE IN EUROPE.

WE HAVE ALEX BRANDT

TALKING ABOUT AN ELECTRONIC
TRANSFER OF FUNDS

TO AN ACCOUNT, YOUR ACCOUNT.
FRESH START CONSTRUCTION.

SO WHY WOULD HE
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT

IF YOU WEREN'T DOING
A LITTLE LAUNDRY WORK FOR HIM?

Ray: I DID MY TIME,
AND WHEN I GOT OUT,

I DID EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NICE PEOPLE WANTED.

I WENT STRAIGHT. I BECAME
A SUCCESSFUL CONTRACTOR

AND I PUT A LOT OF GUYS
BACK TO WORK

WHO COULD'VE WOUND UP
BACK IN THE JOINT.

Frank: I'D LIKE
TO BELIEVE THAT.

Parker: YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A CONVICTION.

Phil: COME ON, PARKER.
WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH

TO HOLD JACKSON INDEFINITELY
WHILE WE INVESTIGATE

AND WITHOUT BAIL.

Ray: THIS CONVERSATION
IS OVER!

I WANT TO TALK
TO MY LAWYER ALONE.

DO SOMETHING, FLEMING.
WHAT AM I PAYING YOU FOR?

Parker: HEY, RAY,
THEY'RE BLUFFING.

ALL RIGHT? NOW LOOK,
WE'LL FILE AN INJUNCTION,

CLAIMING RESTRAINT OF TRADE.

NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT THE HELL
THEY HAVE ON YOU.

Ray: NOTHING.

Phil: RAY'S THE WORST OF THEM.
HE'S DONE HARD TIME BEFORE.

Parker: OH, REMEMBER, PHIL,

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THURSDAY.

Frank: WHAT'S THURSDAY?

Parker: OH, I WAS HOPING
TO COAX THIS GUY

INTO ANNOUNCING
HIS CANDIDACY.

Frank: OH, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

Frank: THAT'S WHAT CAROLINE
KEEPS SAYING.

Parker: I'M GONNA THROW
A LITTLE FUNDRAISER FOR HIM,

GENERATE SOME INTEREST,
MAYBE EXTRACT SOME MONEY.

Frank: IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN
TO THE MONEY.

Parker: HOW ABOUT CAROLINE?

WILL SHE MAKE IT
TO THE PARTY?

Phil: WELL, I WOULD THINK SO.

I HAVE TO PICK HER UP
AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE

A LITTLE LATER
THIS AFTERNOON.

A LIMO'S
GONNA BRING HERE THERE.

Phil: HA HA! LISTEN TO ME.
I SOUND LIKE A MOVIE STAR.

Frank: HA HA!

Anna: AND HOW ARE
OUR PAMPERED PATIENTS

DOING THIS MORNING?

Mac: SAME AS YOU LEFT THEM.

MS. RAPHAELSON'S
PACKED AND READY TO GO.

OH, HER HUSBAND CALLED
AND SAID HE'LL PICK HER UP

AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

Anna:
AND WHERE'S WILBUR?

Mac: CAR MUST BE
IN THE GARAGE BY NOW.

I'M OUTTA HERE.

Anna:
MAC, WOULD YOU STAY

A FEW MINUTES
AFTER YOUR SHIFT

SO I CAN TAKE HER
DOWNSTAIRS?

Mac: MM-HMM.

Anna: ALL RIGHT, CAROLINE,
ARE YOU READY

FOR YOUR BIG DEBUT?

MR. RAPHAELSON IS GONNA MEET YOU
AT DR. MANSER'S OFFICE.

LET'S SEE. DO WE HAVE ALL OF
HER PERSONAL BELONGINGS, WILBUR?

THANK YOU.
AND LET'S MOVE OUT.

Wilbur: BYE-BYE, MRS. R!

Mac: HEY, YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF NOW.

Anna: DON'T TRY TO TALK IF YOUR
FACE FEELS TOO SWOLLEN.

IT'LL TAKE A FEW DAYS FOR YOU
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.

[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

Man: HEY.

Anna: HEY.

YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO?

Man: YES. DR. MANSER AT
THE DESHIELDS MEDICAL BUILDING.

OK.

I MAKE THIS RUN
3 TIMES A WEEK MAYBE.

I THINK THAT GUY'S SO RICH,
HE COULD BUY BEVERLY HILLS.

Anna: HA HA!

Woman: GOOD MORNING,
MRS. RAPHAELSON.

THANKS, TOM.

HERE, I'LL TAKE THAT
FOR YOU.

WELL, IT'S SHOW TIME.

YOU MUST BE SO EXCITED.

YOU'RE IN EXAM ROOM 4
TODAY, OK?

THERE WE GO.

AND GET RIGHT UP
ON THIS TABLE HERE.

UP YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.
HOW YOU FEELING?

Dr. Manser: CAROLINE, GOOD
TO SEE YOU. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

Phil: HI, HONEY.

YOU READY
TO MEET THE NEW YOU?

Dr. Manser: I ALWAYS WARN MY PATIENTS
NOT TO EXPECT TOO MUCH CHANGE.

THE GOAL OF RHITIDOPLASTY
IS TO ERASE 10 YEARS,

NOT TO TURN YOU
INTO A SUPERMODEL.

Phil: FRANKLY, SHE LOOKED
JUST FINE TO ME BEFORE.

Dr. Manser:
DRUMROLL, PLEASE.

NOW, DON'T BE SCARED
BY WHAT YOU SEE.

THE SURGERY WENT VERY WELL,

BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE
2 OR 3 WEEKS

FOR THE SWELLING
AND THE BRUISING TO DISSIPATE.

HOW WAS HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY?
DID THEY TREAT YOU GOOD?

I SEND A LOT OF PATIENTS THERE.

LET'S SEE
WHAT MAGIC I'VE WROUGHT.

Phil: WHAT IS THIS?!

Phil: UH, HEY! WHAT--

HEY, STOP! COME BACK HERE!

Woman: EXCUSE ME, MISS!
WAIT! WHERE ARE YOU GOING!

Phil: WAIT A SECOND!
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

Dr. Manser: NURSE!

Phil: WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU!

DAMN!

Owen: COME ON, COME ON!
GO. COME ON!.

Girl: GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

Phil: STOP!

WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?!

WHERE IS MY WIFE?!

Girl: THERE YOU GO.

Woman: BYE.

Kathy: HI. CAN I HAVE
A NONFAT VANILLA LATTE, PLEASE?

Girl: SURE.

[TOW TRUCK BEEPING]

Girl: THERE YOU GO.

Kathy: WAIT! WAIT!
HEY, WAIT!

LOOK, I KNOW I PARKED
IN THE RED ZONE,

BUT I ALWAYS DO THAT!

COME ON!

HEY! HEY, COME BACK, PLEASE!

OHH! OHH!

Frank: HI.

Kathy: OH! OK, OK.

WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT, FRANK?

Frank: I WANT TO HELP YOU
GET YOUR CAR BACK.

Kathy: RIGHT.

Frank: NEED A RIDE?

Kathy: ACTUALLY, I DO.

Kathy: I'VE GIVEN YOU
MORE AT-BATS

THAN A KINDERGARTEN
SOFTBALL LEAGUE,

AND IT ALWAYS ENDS UP
THE SAME WAY--

WITH YOU TALKING ME
INTO WORKING WITH YOU

AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT.

Frank: YOU GOT GREAT JUDGMENT.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

I THINK
WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

I THINK
WE WORK WELL TOGETHER.

WE GOT SYNCHRONICITY.

Kathy: SYNCHRONICITY?
LIKE THAT IDENTITY THEFT CASE?

Frank: WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MADE MORE SENSE

THAT I TOOK THE WOMAN OUT
THAN YOU.

Kathy: HA! FOR DINNER
AND DRINKS MAYBE,

BUT NOT THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

Frank: A GOOD POINT.

Kathy: HA HA! GOTTA GO.

Frank: UM...

Kathy: FRANK, I GOTTA WORK.

Frank: LOOK, JUST HEAR ME OUT
FOR A SECOND.

WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY
HIGH-PROFILE KIDNAPPING

OF A FEDERAL OFFICIAL.

Kathy: KIDNAPPING?
WHO'S THE VICTIM?

Frank: CAROLINE RAPHAELSON.

SHE'S THE WIFE TO THE
U.S. ATTORNEY PHIL RAPHAELSON.

Kathy:
YEAH, I KNOW WHO HE IS.

Frank: WELL, PHIL AND I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON A CASE TOGETHER.

HAS TO DO WITH MONEY LAUNDERING
AND TERRORIST FUNDING.

IT'S GOT EVERYTHING IN IT.

Kathy: I'M LISTENING.

Frank: ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR--

CAROLINE RAPHAELSON
JUST GOT A ROUTINE FACE-LIFT

FROM A DR. ANDREW MANSER.

NOW, SHE WAS TRANSFERRED
TO A LUXURY AFTERCARE FACILITY,

A PLACE CALLED
HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY.

SHE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE.

TODAY, THE LIMO COMES BY,

PICKS HER UP, AND TAKES HER
BACK TO THE DOCTOR

TO HAVE
THE BANDAGES REMOVED.

Kathy:
OK, WHAT'S THE PUZZLE?

Frank:
THE BANDAGES CAME OFF,

BUT IT WASN'T
CAROLINE RAPHAELSON

THAT WAS UNDER ALL THAT GAUZE.
IT WAS A TEENAGE GIRL.

TEENAGE GIRL GETS UP,
SHE BOLTS OUT THE DOOR.

Kathy: WELL, THAT'S A NEAT TRICK.
CAN I GO VISIT THIS DOCTOR?

Frank: LOOK, IF IT WAS EASY,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

PHIL SAW HIS WIFE LAST NIGHT.

SAID THERE WAS NO QUESTION
IT WAS CAROLINE.

Kathy: SOMEBODY
OBVIOUSLY MADE THE SWITCH

PRESUMABLY AFTER HE LEFT
HIS WIFE IN AFTERCARE.

Frank: WE INTERVIEWED THE NURSES,
THE TECHNICIANS, THE WHOLE STAFF,

THEY SAY THERE WAS NO WAY
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

Kathy:
REALLY? THAT'S INTRIGUING.

Frank: LOOK, I NEED PHIL
FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS, OK?

THAT MEANS I WANT YOU
TO FIND THE WIFE.

YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON
FOR THE JOB.

Phil: HERE ARE THE MOST RECENT
PHOTOS I HAVE OF CAROLINE.

IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING NEW,
I'LL BE AT THE OFFICE.

Officer: ALL RIGHT, SIR.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Phil: HELLO?

Man: I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT.

Phil: WHO IS THIS?

Officer: WHAT IS IT?

Man: WE HAVE A VERY PRETTY LADY
WHO WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

Phil: CAROLINE?

Man: SHE'S A LITTLE EXCITED,
BUT WE'LL CALM HER DOWN.

Phil: YOU--
YOU BETTER NOT HURT HER.

Man: IF YOU COOPERATE,
SHE'LL BE FINE.

IF NOT-- WELL, I SUGGEST YOU DO
WHAT WE TELL YOU.

Phil: I'M LISTENING.

Frank: HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE
TO RENT A LIMO FOR THE EVENING?

Man: IT'S $85 AN HOUR

AND WE HAVE
A 4-HOUR MINIMUM.

BOSS SAYS NO EXCEPTIONS.
COMPANY POLICY.

Frank: WHAT'S YOUR COMPANY
POLICY ON KIDNAPPING?

Man: I GO GET THE BOSS.

Frank: I DON'T WANT TALK TO YOUR BOSS.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

YOUR NAME'S
GREGOR ALEXSAVICH, RIGHT?

Kathy: YOU DROVE
CAROLINE RAPHAELSON

FROM HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY
TO DR. MANSER'S THIS MORNING?

Gregor: RIGHT.

Frank: ANYTHING HAPPEN
OUT OF THE ORDINARY

WHILE YOU WERE THERE?

Gregor:<i>NYET.</i>
DRIVE TO DESHIELDS MEDICAL,

ENTER ON LEVEL 2,
PARK, AND WAIT.

Frank: DID SHE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU?

Gregor: NOT A WORD.
NOT EVEN "THANK YOU."

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

Frank: YES. FRANK. GO.

WHEN?

OK, I'M ON MY WAY.

UH, EXCUSE US.

PHIL JUST GOT A CALL
ON THE RANSOM DEMAND.

WE GOTTA GET OVER THERE
RIGHT AWAY.

Kathy:
FRANK, I GOTTA GET HOME.

Frank: YOU GOT A CHOICE.

EITHER YOU GO WITH ME
OR I'LL HAVE THE LIMO DRIVER

TAKE YOU BACK TO THE GARAGE
AND DROP YOU OFF. EITHER WAY.

Kathy: WELL, THAT'S NICE. THE LAST
LADY THAT GOT IN HIS CAR DISAPPEARED.

Frank:
LOOK, I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING,
CALL ME AT THAT NUMBER.

Kathy:
TALK ABOUT KIDNAPPING.

Phil: FRANK.

Frank: HI, PHIL.

Phil: THEY'VE GOT CAROLINE.

THEY PUT HER ON THE PHONE.
SHE SOUNDED TERRIFIED.

Kathy: ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS YOUR WIFE'S VOICE?

I'M SORRY. I'M JANE DOE.

Phil: YEAH. YEAH,
OF COURSE I'M SURE.

ANYWAY, THEY CALLED ME
ON MY PERSONAL CELL PHONE.

Kathy: CALLER ID?

Phil: RESTRICTED.

Frank: YOU SAID THEY.

WAS THERE MORE THAN ONE CALLER
ON THE LINE?

Phil: NO. IT WAS JUST
THE ONE GUY,

AND I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
HIS VOICE.

I'M SORRY. SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

SORRY. I KNOW
I'M NOT BEING OF MUCH HELP.

I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR
FOR 30 YEARS,

BUT WHEN
IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU--

Frank: TELL ME
ABOUT THE RANSOM DEMAND.

Phil: THE CALLER SAID THAT
IF I DON'T DROP ALL CHARGES

AGAINST RAY JACKSON

AND RELEASE HIM FROM JAIL
WITHIN 72 HOURS,

CAROLINE WILL BE KILLED.

Kathy: RAY JACKSON?

Frank: YEAH.

Phil: HE ALSO SAID
THAT IF ANY OF THIS LEAKS OUT,

THEY WON'T EVEN WAIT
THAT LONG.

Kathy: WELL, EXCUSE ME,

BUT WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DROP THE CHARGES

AND REFILE THEM
A WEEK LATER?

Phil: NO. I HAVE TO
DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE

SO THAT JACKSON CAN'T BE
REARRESTED AND CHARGED AGAIN.

Frank: WELL,
THEY DID THEIR HOMEWORK.

WHAT'D YOU SAY
TO THE CALLER?

Phil: I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, REALLY.

I STALLED, I PLAYED DUMB,

JUST TRYING TO PUSH BACK
THAT DEADLINE.

OF COURSE, IT WAS NO USE.
72 HOURS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Kathy: FRANK TOLD ME
THAT YOU VISITED CAROLINE

AT HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY
LAST NIGHT?

Phil: YES. SHE WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT THE UNVEILING.

Frank: PHIL,
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS CAROLINE

UNDER ALL THOSE BANDAGES?

I MEAN, YOU'RE POSITIVE?

Phil: YEAH. I'D THINK
I'D KNOW IF IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

Frank: I'M JUST TOUCHING
ALL THE BASES, PHIL.

Phil: I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

WHAT'S KILLING ME

IS THAT I SHOULD'VE
SPOTTED IT IMMEDIATELY

AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

I MEAN, THE WAY
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

THE WAY
SHE CARRIED HER BODY.

I JUST PUT IT DOWN
TO NERVES.

IF WE COULD'VE GRABBED
THAT GIRL RIGHT AWAY,

SHE WOULD HAVE LED US
RIGHT TO CAROLINE.

Kathy: CAN YOU DESCRIBE HER?

Phil: THE POLICE
SENT ME THIS FAX.

LOOKS JUST LIKE HER.

Kathy: SHE BARELY LOOKS 16.

Frank: FOR ALL WE KNOW, SOMEBODY
COULD'VE GIVEN THIS GIRL

100 BUCKS AND TOLD HER THEY WERE
PLAYING A PRACTICAL JOKE.

Phil: I SUPPOSE.
BUT WHOEVER THAT SOMEONE WAS

MADE PRETTY DAMN SURE
SHE GOT AWAY.

Kathy: CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HER AT ALL?

Phil: NOTHING MORE
THAN I TOLD THE POLICE.

SHE WAS ABOUT CAROLINE'S HEIGHT,
CAROLINE'S COLORING.

SHE WAS PRETTY,
BUT NOT A GREAT BEAUTY.

NOT LIKE CAROLINE WAS.

Girl: HOW LONG DO I
HAVE TO STAY IN HERE?

Owen: TILL IT'S TIME TO GO.

Girl: WELL, WHEN'S THAT?

Owen: OH, YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.

Girl: LOOK,
THERE IS NOTHING TO DO.

Owen: QUIT YOUR WHINING.
YOU'RE GETTING PAID.

Girl: I'M NOT WHINING.
I'M BORED.

Owen: TAKE A NAP,
READ A BOOK, DO SOMETHING,

BUT DO IT QUIETLY, HUH?

[DOOR SLAMS]

[PADLOCK CLICKS]

Marvin: HI, BOSS.

I HAVE THE INFORMATION
YOU ASKED FOR--

WORK-UPS
ON DR. MANSER'S STAFF

AND THE CAR SERVICE PERSONNEL
PHONE RECORDS,

FINGERPRINTS
FROM MRS. RAPHAELSON'S ROOM

AT THE AFTERCARE FACILITY--

Frank: ALL RIGHT, MARVIN,
CUT TO THE CHASE FOR ME.

ANY CONNECTION
TO RAY JACKSON AT ALL?

Marvin: NO, SIR,
BUT WE'RE STILL DIGGING.

Frank: OK. GOOD.

PULL UP THE GRAPHICS
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

Kathy: SO, FRANK,
YOU REALLY THINK

THAT RAY JACKSON
IS INVOLVED?

Frank: IT'S TOUGH TO BE GETTING
19 COUNTS OF BANK ROBBERY.

JACKSON'S A REAL ROLE MODEL.

HE EMPLOYS A BUNCH OF EX-CONS
AT HIS SITE.

Kathy: SO YOU THINK
HE EMPLOYS THEM

TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
LIKE KIDNAPPING?

Frank: COULD BE. MARVIN,
ARE YOU HAVING ANY LUCK

PIECING TOGETHER THAT CHATTER
INTO SOMETHING COHERENT?

Marvin: NOT COMPLETELY,
BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.


Frank: AND THIS CAME IN
JUST BEFORE WE ROUSTED JACKSON.

THAT'S ALEX BRANDT.

Kathy:<i>THE</i>ALEX BRANDT?

Kathy: YOU'VE BEEN CHASING
THAT CREEP AROUND FOR YEARS.

YOU GOT A LINE ON HIM
THROUGH JACKSON?

Frank: MARVIN, COULD YOU
PULL UP THE PHOTOS FOR ME?

YEAH, WE THINK ALEX BRANDT IS
USING RAY JACKSON AS A FRONT.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW
IS THE IDENTITY

OF BRANDT'S U.S. PARTNER.

Kathy: WHAT ARE THEY TALKING--
A MEETING?

WHAT IS IT? A MONEY LAUNDERERS'
CONVENTION OR WHAT?

Frank: LOOK, LISTEN TO ME.

I NEED YOU TO CONCENTRATE
ON CAROLINE RAPHAELSON.

I'LL TAKE CARE OF JACKSON.

WE NEED TO DIG FAST.
WE'RE ON A NASTY DEADLINE.

MARVIN,
YOU REMEMBER JANE DOE.

Marvin: JANE DOE.

Frank: YOU GET HER
ANYTHING SHE NEEDS, OK?

Marvin: YES. THEN
YOU'LL WANT TO SEE THIS--

BACKGROUND ON MAC McINTYRE.
HE WAS THE NIGHT NURSE.

ON DUTY FROM 11 P.M.

UNTIL HE WAS RELIEVED
AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING

BY THE DAY NURSE,
ANNA REICHMAN.

THERE WAS ALSO AN ORDERLY,

A, UH...
MENTALLY CHALLENGED GENTLEMAN

NAMED WILBUR RUSSELL.
HE CAME IN AT 8:00.

McINTYRE WAS ALONE
IN THE HALLWAY ALL NIGHT

WITH A CLEAR VIEW TO THE DOOR
OF CAROLINE RAPHAELSON'S ROOM.

HE COULD'VE SEEN THE SWITCH

OR...MADE IT HIMSELF.

Kathy: WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS MAC McINTYRE?

Marvin:
OK, THAT'S THE KICKER.

HE HAS WHAT APPEARS
TO BE AN EXCELLENT RESUME,

EXCEPT EVERY REFERENCE
TURNED OUT TO EITHER BE

A WRONG NUMBER
OR OUT OF ORDER.

Kathy: HOW CONVENIENT.

Marvin: UH-HUH. WE'RE RUNNING
HIS SOCIAL AND HIS PRINTS.

IF IT GETS HAIRY...

I CAN ALWAYS SEND HIS DNA
TO CODIS.

Kathy: EXCELLENT.
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS, OK, MARVIN?

Marvin: YES.

Kathy: THANK YOU.

Frank: ANYTHING?

Kathy: DINNER.
HOW AM I GONNA GET HOME?

Frank: OH, UH...

Kathy: COMPANY CAR?
MOVING UP, HUH?

Frank: THIS, TOO.

Kathy:
AND A BADGE. OLD TIMES.

Frank: BE CAREFUL WITH THEM.

Kathy: I WILL BE.

Jack: HELLO?

Kathy: HEY, HONEY!

Jack: HI. BUY A NEW CAR
AND NOT TELL ME ABOUT IT?

Kathy: NO, IT'S JUST A LOANER
WHILE MINE'S IN THE SHOP.

Jack: HEY.

WHO'S THE GIRL?

Nick: THANKS
FOR DRIVING ME HOME.

Kathy: I DON'T KNOW. THANKS!

Nick: BYE!

Kathy: HE LOOKS KIND OF HAPPY.

Jack: YEAH.

Kathy: EXCUSE ME.
WAIT A MINUTE.

Nick: WHAT?

Kathy: WHAT'S GOING ON?

Nick: I JUST WANT A SNACK.

Kathy:
I'M JUST STARTING DINNER,

AND BESIDES YOU LEFT
THIS MORNING ALL DEPRESSED,

AND TODAY YOU'RE HAPPY.
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL?

Nick: YOU GUYS WILL JUST
MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

Kathy: WE WON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

WILL WE, JACK?

Jack: WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

Nick: OK. YOU HEARD THEY'RE
HAVING A SCHOOL DANCE, RIGHT?

Kathy: HEARD?
I BARELY ESCAPED

HAVING TO SERVE ON
THE REFRESHMENT COMMITTEE.

Jack: I WASN'T SO LUCKY.
CHAPERONE COMMITTEE.

Nick: WELL, I'M GOING...

WITH CARLA SOLOMON.

Kathy: YOU HAVE A DATE?

YOU CAN'T HAVE A DATE.
YOU'RE A BABY.

Jack: HA HA HA!
THAT'S MY BOY!

Nick: FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT A BABY.

I'M ALMOST 13.

Kathy: YOU'RE GONNA BE 13
IN 11 MONTHS.

I MEAN, YOU CAN'T-- YOU'RE JUST
TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A DATE, HONEY.

I MEAN, PRETTY SOON
YOU'RE GONNA BE MARRIED,

AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE KIDS
AND THEN I'M GONNA BE A GRANDMA,

AND I'M WAY TOO YOUNG
TO BE A GRANDMA, YOUNG MAN.

Nick: AREN'T YOU GETTING
A LITTLE AHEAD OF YOURSELF?

ANYWAY, SUSAN'S GOING
TO HAVE KIDS WAY BEFORE I DO.

Kathy: BITE YOUR TONGUE.

Nick: IN SOME PARTS
OF THE WORLD,

PEOPLE GET MARRIED AT 12.

Kathy:
WELL, IN OTHER COUNTRIES,

PEOPLE EAT THEIR NEIGHBORS
FOR DINNER.

IT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT!

Nick: THIS IS WHAT
I CALL MAKING A BIG DEAL.

Kathy: [SIGHS]
ALL RIGHT, SO I LIED.

Nick: JUST DO ME ONE FAVOR.
DON'T TELL SUSAN.

Kathy: WHY NOT?

Nick: BECAUSE BEYOND THE USUAL
EVIL BIG SISTER ISSUE,

SHE'S FRIENDS
WITH CARLA'S SISTER COURTNEY,

AND SHE'LL DRIVE ME NUTS
ABOUT THIS.

Kathy: WELL, MAYBE
SHE'LL BE HAPPY FOR YOU, HONEY.

Nick: SURE, JUST LIKE
MY PARENTS ARE.

I'M GONE.


Jack: HELLO?

YEAH, JUST A SECOND.

IT'S DARNELL FROM U.S. PUZZLE.

Kathy: OH. HI.

Frank: MAC McINTYRE.

Kathy:
ANXIOUS TO MEET HIM.

Frank: WELL, DON'T LOOK
FOR HIM AT WORK.

THOSE PHONY REFERENCES
TURNED OUT TO BE A COVER-UP

FOR A FELONY CONVICTION
ON ARMED ROBBERY.

Kathy: THAT'S A COINCIDENCE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

Frank: EX-CON RAY JACKSON
OUR PRIME SUSPECT,

EX-CON MAC McINTYRE
STATIONED NEXT TO THE VICTIM.

YEAH, I'D SAY SO.

SO FAR,
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING

TO LINK THE TWO
OF THEM TOGETHER.

I'M AFRAID
HE'S GONNA SKIP TOWN.

Kathy: FRANK--

Frank: YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TONIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO.

Kathy: OK.

WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

[MEN TALKING FAINTLY]

Mac: UP! PASS IT UP!
LEFT! LEFT! LEFT!

STRONG SIDE! STRONG SIDE!

GOOD SHOT, DAWG.
GOOD SHOT.

Man: OVER HERE! OVER HERE!
OVER HERE, MAN!

Mac: AH-AH-AH!
HANDLE! HANDLE! HANDLE!

AH, HA HA HA! AHH!

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

Man: STAY ON HIM!
WATCH THE SHOT! WATCH THE SHOT!

OHH!
AW, MAN, CHECK HIM OUT.

Man: OK, YEAH,
WE GOTTA GET BACK, MAN.

[ALL CHATTERING]


Man: OK. HERE WE GO.

Man: YOU GOT IT, BRO.

Man: HEY, YO!
LADY, THE BALL.

Kathy: ONE OF YOU
MAC McINTYRE?

Man: COME ON, WOMAN.

GIVE US THE BALL.
WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.

Kathy: WELL,
HE'S IN BIG-TIME TROUBLE.

NICE.

Mac: YEAH, I'M MAC McINTYRE.
THIS ABOUT HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY?

Kathy: YEAH.

Mac: WELL, LISTEN, I LIED
ON MY RESUME, ALL RIGHT?

SO THEY SEND THE FEDS
OUT FOR THIS NOW?

Kathy:
NEVER SAID I WAS A FED.

Mac: WELL, YOU GOTTA
BE SOMEBODY

CRACKIN' UP ON MY GAME
LIKE THIS, RIGHT?

Kathy: I'M JANE DOE
FROM THE CSA.

I'M HERE BECAUSE CAROLINE
RAPHAELSON WAS KIDNAPPED.

Mac: YEAH.
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

I TOLD THE NURSE AND DIRECTOR
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

SHE FIRED ME ANYWAY.

Kathy: SORRY ABOUT THAT.

Mac: YEAH, ME, TOO.

SO UNLESS YOU GOT
SOME MORE QUESTIONS,

I'M GONNA GET BACK
TO MY GAME WITH MY FELLAS

BECAUSE I GOT MONEY
HANGING ON THIS,

AND AS YOU KNOW,
I'M CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED.

Kathy: COULDN'T RAY JACKSON
HELP YOU WITH THAT?

Mac: WHO'S RAY JACKSON?

Kathy: YOU DON'T KNOW HIM?

Mac: NAH. I AIN'T NEVER
HEARD OF NO RAY JACKSON.

Kathy: ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
PHIL RAPHAELSON SWEARS

THAT HIS WIFE WAS
AT HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY

LAST NIGHT.
THIS MORNING SHE DISAPPEARED.

NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW THAT HAPPENED?

CAN YOU HELP ME AT ALL?

Mac: LISTEN,
WHEN MR. RAPHAELSON LEFT,

HIS WIFE DIDN'T MAKE A PEEP
FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT, OK?

'CAUSE I COULD SEE HER DOOR
FROM MY STATION.

Kathy: YOU NEVER LEFT
YOUR DESK?

Mac: HEY, MAYBE I WENT
TO THE VENDING MACHINE

OR USED THE BATHROOM
OR SOMETHING,

BUT NOT ENOUGH TIME
FOR SOMEBODY

TO TAKE HER BODY
OUT OF THE ROOM

AND PUT SOMEONE ELSE
IN THERE.

LISTEN, LADY, I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH ALL THIS.

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, A'IGHT?

Kathy: I HOPE YOU DIDN'T,
FOR YOUR SAKE.

GOOD LUCK.

Man: HEY, MAN,
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

Mac: EVERYTHING'S COOL, MAN.
COME ON, LET'S PLAY BALL.

Man: ALL RIGHT, COOL, MAN.
HEY, BALL IN, BALL IN.

HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

Mac: I GOT IT.

[ALL CHATTERING]

Mac: OHH!

[LOCK BUZZES]

Guard: ON YOUR FEET, PUMPKIN.
YOU GOT A VISITOR. MOVE IT.

Ray: YOU ALWAYS DROP IN
WITHOUT CALLING?

Frank: I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

Ray: I HAVE A LAWYER,
YOU KNOW.

Frank:
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG, RAY.

I'LL BE GONE
BEFORE HE GETS HERE.

Ray: SO, WHAT
BRINGS YOU BY, FRANK?

Frank: FIRST
WE HAD YOU FOR SUSPICION

OF MONEY LAUNDERING,
NOW KIDNAPPING.

YOU'RE MOVING UP, RAY.

THAT'S A CAPITAL OFFENSE.

Ray: YOU KNOW, UNLESS
I DEMATERIALIZED OUT OF MY CELL

AND REMATERIALIZED
BACK IN IT,

YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
I DIDN'T KIDNAP ANYONE.

Frank: YOU GOT 50 EX-CONS
WORKING FOR YOU.

I DOUBT
IT WOULD BE MUCH TOUGHER

FOR FRESH START CONSTRUCTION
TO PUT TOGETHER A CRIME GANG

THAN IT WOULD A ROOFING CREW.

Ray: WHY DON'T YOU
TELL YOUR OFFICE

TO DROP THEIR CASE
AGAINST ME?

SAVE EVERYONE
A LOT OF GRIEF.

Frank:
TRUST ME ON SOMETHING.

IF THERE'S ANY GRIEF
COMING DOWN,

IT'S COMING YOUR WAY.

Ray: YOU CAN'T PIN
KIDNAPPING ON ME

ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN
PIN MONEY LAUNDERING.

YOU GOT A CASE
AGAINST ALEX BRANDT,

THEN ARREST HIM,
DO YOUR JOB.

OTHERWISE,
LET ME GO DO MINE.

Parker: DON'T TALK!

Ray: THANKS FOR
WATCHING MY BACK, FLEMING.

Parker: DARNELL, PLEASE.

YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO MY CLIENT ALONE.

Frank: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WHEN YOU BROUGHT PHIL HERE?

HE'S TOO EMOTIONALLY
INVOLVED IN THIS.

Phil: I MADE HIM.
I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE DENYING

ANY CONNECTION WITH
MY WIFE'S DISAPPEARANCE?

Parker:
OF COURSE WE DENY IT.

ANYBODY COULD HAVE USED
MR. JACKSON'S NAME.

Ray: I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED.

YOU LOOK A LITTLE LIGHT
IN THE LOAFERS TO ME.

Phil: YOU--

Parker: PHIL! PHIL!
CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!

WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO SETTLE THIS.

PLEASE, CALM DOWN!

Phil: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

CAROLINE'S LIFE IS ON THE LINE
AND HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT!

Ray: I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

CAN I SUE HIM FOR ASSAULT?

Parker: PHIL, YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE.

Frank: WE GOT LESS
THAN 48 HOURS.

Phil: WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON, PARKER?

WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR 20 YEARS!

Ray: 20 YEARS?
OH, YOU TWO ARE BUDDIES?

YOU'RE FIRED, HAIRCUT!

FRANK, GET HIM OUT OF HERE
BEFORE HE HURTS HIMSELF.

Frank: COME ON.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

WELL, THAT WENT WELL.

PHIL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STAY AWAY.

Phil: I COULD
KILL HIM MYSELF.

Parker: WE'LL HAVE TO PRETEND
WE DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

PHIL, YOU KNOW
WHERE MY SYMPATHIES LIE.

AND NOW THAT I'M NO LONGER
REPRESENTING THAT GUY,

I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN.

Phil: I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.

Parker: JUST DON'T LET THIS
KEEP YOU FROM YOUR FUTURE.

THERE'LL BE AN LOT
OF INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE

AT THE PARTY THURSDAY NIGHT,

PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED
IN INVESTING

IN A CANDIDATE LIKE YOU.

FRANK.

Kathy: ANNA?
ANNA REICHMAN?

Anna: THAT'S ME.

Kathy: COULD I SPEAK
WITH YOU FOR A MINUTE?

I'M FROM THE CSA.

Anna: OK, WELL,
IF YOU COULD MAKE IT FAST.

I'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE BANK

AND I'VE GOT
A ROCK STAR FACELIFT

ARRIVING IN ONE HOUR.

Kathy: ROCK STARS SHOULDN'T
BE HAVING FACELIFTS.

Anna: ROCK STARS
SHOULDN'T BE COLLECTING

SOCIAL SECURITY EITHER,
BUT THEY ARE.

Kathy: HOW WELL DID
YOU KNOW MAC McINTYRE?

Anna: NOT AS WELL
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

UH, HE IS NIGHT SHIFT,
I'M DAY SHIFT.

OTHER THAN SAYING HELLO
TO HIM IN THE HALL,

I CAN'T SAY
I KNEW HIM AT ALL.

Kathy: HMM.

Anna: I ASSUME YOU'RE SAYING
THAT HE WAS INVOLVED

IN THE KIDNAPPING?

Kathy: WELL, HE WAS ALONE
WITH THE PATIENT ALL NIGHT.

SO COULD YOU BE POSITIVE

THAT THE WOMAN
WHO WAS WHEELED DOWNSTAIRS

TO THE LIMOUSINE ACTUALLY
WAS CAROLINE RAPHAELSON?

Anna:
HONESTLY? NO, I CAN'T.

YOU KNOW, HER FACE
WAS COMPLETELY COVERED,

AND SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

LET'S SEE. I TOLD HER
NOT TO TRY TO TALK

BECAUSE USUALLY
A PATIENT'S FACE IS SO SORE

THAT IT'S PAINFUL
FOR THEM TO TRY TO SPEAK.

I'M SORRY.

I WISH I COULD
BE MORE HELP.

MRS. RAPHAELSON SEEMED
LIKE SUCH A NICE PERSON,

AND OF COURSE IT REFLECTS
SO BADLY ON HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY.

YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN HERE 12 YEARS.

WE HAVEN'T HAD
A BIT OF TROUBLE UNTIL NOW.

Kathy: EXCEPT FOR
THAT OCCASIONAL ROCK STAR

SCREAMING, "MEDS! MEDS!"

Anna: HA HA HA!

Kathy: OH, MY, THAT'S SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE.

LOOKS ANTIQUE. IS IT OLD?

Anna: IT'S NEW TO ME.

BIRTHDAY GIFT
FROM MY MOTHER.

Kathy: THAT'S-- OH,
AND THE MATCHING RING

AND EARRINGS.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

WELL, BACK TO THE SALT MINES.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE
WILBUR RUSSELL IS?

Anna: YES, HE'S
JUST MAKING UP ROOM 425.

Kathy: 4-- IS THAT
CAROLINE'S ROOM?

Anna: YEAH.

Kathy: OH.

Anna: YOU KNOW WILBUR IS...

Kathy: YES,
MENTALLY CHALLENGED. I KNOW.

Anna: BUT HIGHLY FUNCTIONING.

WE'VE NEVER BEEN SORRY
WE HIRED HIM, NOT FOR A DAY.

Kathy: THAT'S GREAT.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

WHOOP! SO SPARKLY.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. BYE.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]
WILBUR?

Wilbur: YOU'RE THE LADY
FROM WASHINGTON.

HOLY COW. I HEARD
YOU TALKING WITH MISS ANNA.

YOU'RE THE CSA.
THEY'RE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

WE STUDIED IT IN CIVICS CLASS.

Kathy: OH!

ACTUALLY, THE HEADQUARTERS
IS IN WASHINGTON.

I WORK RIGHT HERE IN L.A.

Wilbur: HOW LONG
HAVE YOU WORKED THERE?

DO YOU CARRY A GUN?
IS IT A FUN JOB?

Kathy: SOMETIMES IT'S FUN
AND I'VE WORKED THERE

FOR A LONG TIME ON AND OFF,
MOSTLY OFF,

AND, NO,
I DON'T CARRY A GUN.

I DON'T BELIEVE IN 'EM.
I USE MY FINGER.

SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE
AT HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY?

Wilbur: OH, HOLY COW.

6 YEARS, 8 MONTHS,
AND 4 DAYS.

Kathy: YOU MUST BE
VERY GOOD AT YOUR JOB.

Wilbur: I TRY EXTRA HARD
'CAUSE I HAVE TO.

Kathy: OH, WELL,

THIS IS AN A-NUMBER ONE
HOSPITAL CORNER.

UM, HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW
MAC McINTYRE?

Wilbur: MAC WOULDN'T DO
ANYTHING BAD

NO MATTER
WHAT MISS ANNA SAYS.

HE'S ALWAYS
REALLY NICE TO ME,

EVEN WHEN
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.

EVEN IF--
EVEN IF I FORGOT SOMETHING

OR MADE A MISTAKE.

Kathy: WE'RE NOT SAYING
HE DID ANYTHING WRONG.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
CAROLINE RAPHAELSON DISAPPEARED.

SO DO YOU REMEMBER

IF SHE SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU YESTERDAY?

Wilbur: NO, NOT IN WORDS.

SHE GRUNTED ONCE
AND SHE WAVED.

Kathy:
SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE

IF CAROLINE WAS THE WOMAN
YOU TOOK DOWNSTAIRS YESTERDAY?

Wilbur: WELL, I PUT HER
IN THE CHAIR.

MISS ANNA TOOK HER
TO THE GARAGE.

Kathy: MISS ANNA?

Wilbur:
I THOUGHT IT WAS HER.

SHE WAS WEARING
THAT BIG HAT.

Kathy: OH, YEAH.

WELL, WILBUR,
IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE,

WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL ME?

Wilbur:
IS THIS A REAL CSA CARD?

Kathy: YEAH.
THANK YOU, WILBUR.

Wilbur: BYE-BYE.

Owen: FEELING BETTER?

Girl: LET ME OUT.

Owen: YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SCREAM, ARE YOU?

I HEARD YOU LAST NIGHT.

FYI, SWEETHEART.

I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN HEAR YOU.

Girl: LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO GET OUT OF TOWN, OK?

YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY,
I DISAPPEAR.

I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY.

Owen: OH, I WISH
I COULD BELIEVE THAT.

Girl: LOOK, I REALLY
DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

Owen: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.
YOU DO KNOW ME.

ONE DAY YOU COULD BE READING
THE NEWSPAPER AND...

Girl: LOOK, YOU CAN'T KEEP ME
LOCKED UP HERE FOREVER!

Owen: I NEVER PLANNED TO.
IT WAS A TEST

TO SEE HOW STABLE YOU WERE.

FRANKLY,
YOU'RE NOT DOING SO WELL.

Girl: I'LL DO BETTER.

I PROMISE.

Owen: OH, PLEASE, KID, HUH?

Girl: COME ON, MAN.
LET ME GO.

Owen: OK, ON ONE CONDITION.

I PUT YOU ON A PLANE MYSELF

AND YOU NEVER
COME BACK HERE AGAIN.

Girl: FINE.
SEND ME ANYWHERE.

I DON'T CARE,
AND I WON'T COME BACK.

I DON'T EVEN READ
THE NEWSPAPERS ANYWAY.

Owen: WELL,
REMEMBER IF YOU DID,

YOU'RE IN THIS EVERY BIT
AS DEEP AS I AM. YOU DIG?

Girl: I DIG.

Owen: GOOD.

Jack: LOOK AT THIS.

EVERYBODY'S BEEN
SO BUSY LATELY,

IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
A FAMILY DINNER.

I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD TAKE A PICTURE.

Susan: NO, PLEASE DON'T.

Jack: HOW MANY TIMES
DO I GET TO SIT TOGETHER

WITH ALL MY FAVORITE PEOPLE?

Nick: I THOUGHT WE ALWAYS GOT
TOGETHER LIKE THIS EVERY NIGHT.

Jack: GUYS, HUMOR ME,
WOULD YOU?

Kathy: YOU TWO,
HUMOR YOUR DAD NOW.

[ALL CHUCKLING]

Jack: SO, NICK, ARE YOU EXCITED
ABOUT YOUR DATE?

Nick: OHHH!

Susan: NICK HAS A DATE?
THIS NICK?

WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER,
THE SCIENCE FAIR?

Kathy: NICK HAS A DATE
FOR THE DANCE,

AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HAPPY
FOR HIM, HONEY.

Susan: WHO'S THE VICTIM?

Nick: NO ONE YOU KNOW.

Jack: CARLA SOMETHING, RIGHT?

Susan: CARLA?
NOT CARLA SOLOMON.

MY BROTHER'S GOING ON A DATE
WITH CARLA SOLOMON?

NO! THIS IS A TRAGEDY.

THIS IS LIKE A REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD DREAM.

Jack: WHAT'S WRONG
WITH CARLA SOLOMON?

Nick: NOTHING.

Susan: SHE'S COURTNEY'S
LITTLE SISTER,

AND SHE'S EVEN
MORE OF A NERD THAN NICK IS.

Kathy: YOUR BROTHER'S
NOT A NERD, HONEY.

Susan: YEAH, HE IS.

Nick: I LIKE CARLA.

SHE'S SMART AND SHE'S FUNNY,
UNLIKE YOU.

Susan: I DON'T CARE
IF SHE CAN FLY,

I DON'T WANT YOU
EMBARRASSING ME

BY BRINGING HER
TO THE SCHOOL DANCE.

Jack: YOU KNOW,
I MAY HAVE A SOLUTION.

WELL, SINCE YOU'RE SO UPSET
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER

TAKING CARLA TO THE DANCE,

MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE THERE
TO SEE IT.

AFTER ALL, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO COMPROMISE YOUR REPUTATION.

WHAT DO YOU THINK, HONEY?

Susan:
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING! MOM?

Kathy: IT MIGHT BE HAPPENING.
LET'S SLEEP ON IT.

Woman: I'M SO GLAD
YOU ENJOYED IT.

YOU KNOW SHE SAID
THAT SHE THOUGHT...

Frank: NICE SHOT.

Parker: THAT'S ENOUGH!

Frank: I GUESS
JACKSON WASN'T KIDDING

ABOUT THE TENNIS CLUB
GOOD OL' BOY NETWORK, HUH?

Parker: WELL, MR. JACKSON
HAS A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER

THE SIZE OF KANSAS.

Frank:
THINK PHIL'S GONNA CAVE,

DROP THE CHARGES
AGAINST JACKSON?

Parker: JACKSON'S NOT MY CLIENT
ANYMORE, REMEMBER?

HE FIRED ME.

Frank: YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

IT WOULD HELP IF
YOU WERE BACK ON THE CASE.

LOOK, YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH BOTH MEN.

YOU MAKE THE PERFECT
INTERMEDIARY. IT WORKS.

Parker: OH, DARNELL,
YOU GOT SOME NERVE.

YOU KNOW THAT?

YOU STARTED UP
THIS WHOLE HORNETS' NEST

AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO GO
AND BEG FOR MY JOB BACK

FROM THIS SEMI-LITERATE,
TWO-TIME LOSER.

HELL, WHERE DO I SIGN UP?

Frank: DO YOU USUALLY REPRESENT
PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE?

Parker: I INVARIABLY REPRESENT
PEOPLE I DON'T LIKE.

YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO PROOF
THAT JACKSON HAD ANYTHING

TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS,
RANSOM DEMAND OR NOT.

Frank: STILL SOUND LIKE
HIS LAWYER TO ME.

Parker: [CHUCKLES]

ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO HIM,

BUT I'M GONNA TELL HIM
WE HAD THIS LITTLE CONVERSATION.

IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY ME,
YOU PICKED THE WRONG GUY.

Frank: I'M NOT TRYING
TO PLAY YOU.

MIND IF WE GO OFF THE RECORD
FOR A MINUTE?

LOOK, THE TRUTH IS
I'M WORRIED ABOUT PHIL.

HE'S GOT A LOT ON HIM
RIGHT NOW.

I'M JUST SAYING AS A FRIEND,

IS THERE ANYTHING YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO FOR HIM?

Parker: YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
MY LITTLE FUND RAISER

WOULD CHEER HIM UP.

Frank: NOTHING LIKE
A BLACK TIE EVENT

TO HELP YOU FORGET
ABOUT YOUR KIDNAPPED WIFE.

Parker: YEAH. HEY,
YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME IF YOU WANT TO.

HERE.

Frank: $100 A PLATE?

I DON'T THINK I'LL BE GOING
TO ANY PARTIES SOON.

Parker: WELL,
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,

I KNOW PHIL COULD
USE THE SUPPORT.

Alex: I UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION IS COMPLICATED,

BUT IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

THAT'S WHY I HIRED YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF THESE THINGS.

NOW, LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
GET THE FEDS OFF MY BACK.

Tommy: SO, MR. BRANDT,

IS THE TRANSACTION
STILL ON FOR LATER?

Alex: OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE'VE RUN INTO SOME TROUBLE.

THE FEDS HAVE FROZEN FRESH
START CONSTRUCTION'S ASSETS,

AND THAT'S CREATED
A BIT OF A DILEMMA.

WITHOUT ACCESS TO OUR MONEY,
WE CAN'T DO BUSINESS.

Tommy: SO WHAT'S NEXT?

Alex: WE WAIT,

AND WE LET OUR EMPLOYEES
DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO.

Tommy: AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF THEY'RE UNABLE

TO COOL THE FEDS OFF?

Alex: IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT I HAD TO COME

ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THIS COUNTRY

TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS.

IF OUR EMPLOYEES
CAN'T DO THEIR JOBS,

WELL, YOU AND I MIGHT HAVE
TO MAKE SOME HOUSE CALLS.

Tommy: I UNDERSTAND.

Kathy: HELLO?

HELLO?


Kathy: OH, HELLO. HI.
UH-- UH--

CALM DOWN.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

OK, I'M JUST GONNA
BE GOING RIGHT NOW.

Eddie: DANGEROUS PLACE
TO BE SNOOPING AROUND

ALL BY YOUR LONESOME.

Kathy: I'M NOT
REALLY SNOOPING.

I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
OPENING A BOUTIQUE HERE

IN ONE OF THESE, UH,
YOU KNOW, PLACES.

Eddie: YOU SEEM NERVOUS.

Kathy: NOT REALLY.


Kathy: IS HE TRAINED?

Eddie: NOT REALLY.
YOU A COP?

Kathy: NOT REALLY.

WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE GOING.

AREN'T YOU BOYS
BEING A BIT OBVIOUS?

YOU WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE?

Man: WHO IS THIS LADY?
COME ON!

Kathy: WHOO! GOOD THING
IT'S THE COMPANY CAR.

Man: IDIOT, LET'S GO!
OVER HERE!

Man: STEP ON IT!
STEP ON IT!

Man: THERE SHE GOES.
THERE SHE GOES.

HEY, WATCH OUT!

Kathy: WHOA! HA HA HA!

OHH!

Man: AAH!

TURN, YOU IDIOT!
COME ON! TURN IT AROUND!

GO BACK THAT WAY!
FOLLOW HER THAT WAY!

Kathy: [EXHALES]

WHOO-HOO! ALL RIGHT!

Man: THERE SHE GOES.
THERE SHE GOES.

Kathy: â™ª COME ON


Kathy: HA! HOPE YOU HAD
YOUR SEAT BELTS ON, GUYS!

Man: [COUGHING]

Second man: UHH!

Man: NICE.

YOU IDIOT!


Man: OH, GREAT.
NOW THE BOSS IS HERE.

LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA
EXPLAIN IT TO HIM, OK?

NOT ME THIS TIME. YOU!

YOU LOST HER,
YOU TALK TO HIM!

Owen: WELL, THIS LOOKS
LIKE IT WENT GREAT.

Man: YEAH, WELL, WE KIND OF HAD
A HARD TIME KEEPING UP.

Owen: DRIVING A MUSCLE CAR
WITH A V-8 ENGINE?

Man: WE DEFINITELY
GOT HER ATTENTION, OK,

JUST LIKE YOU WANTED.

Owen: MORONS!

Frank: ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?

ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I GOTTA GO. RIGHT.

Kathy:
FRANK, I GOT TO GET HOME.

ANY IDEA ON THE GRUESOME TWOSOME
WHO WERE CHASING ME?

Frank: NO, NOT ENOUGH INFO,

BUT THE MAN YOU SAW THEM MEET,
I WAS ABLE TO NAIL HIM DOWN.

HIS NAME IS OWEN KRAMER.

Kathy: NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

Frank: HE'S A P.I.

STRANGELY ENOUGH,
HE'S IN GOOD STANDINGS.

HE LIVES IN VALLEY VILLAGE.
WANT TO COME ALONG?

Kathy: WELL, IT'S PRACTICALLY
ON MY WAY HOME.

Kathy:
YOU FIND ME AMUSING?

Frank: NO, I-- I--
I FIND YOU REASSURING.

IN THE WORLD OF
CHAOS AND CONFUSION,

KATHY DAVIS NEVER CHANGES.

Kathy: ALL RIGHT.

I LOVE THIS CAR.
YOU WANT TO RACE?

HEE HEE HEE!

Owen: YOU GOT
EVERYTHING PACKED?

Girl: YEAH.
I'M READY TO GO.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Frank: HI.

Owen: HI.

Frank: YOU OWEN KRAMER?

Owen: YEAH.

Frank: MY NAME'S FRANK DARNELL.
I'M WITH THE CSA.

THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT ONE OF YOUR INVESTIGATIONS

HAS INTERSECTED
WITH ONE OF OURS.

I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

YOU GOT A MINUTE?

Owen:
SURE. WHAT'S THE CASE?

Frank: IT HAS TO DO
WITH AN EX-CON

NAMED RAY JACKSON.
YOU KNOW HIM?

Owen: I CAN'T SAY I DO.

Frank: EVER DO ANY WORK FOR
FIRST START CONSTRUCTION?

Owen: NOPE.

Frank: HOW ABOUT FLEMING,
WALLACE, AND DELUCA?

Owen: DOESN'T RING A BELL.

Frank: SURE ABOUT THAT?

THE REASON WHY I ASK
IS BECAUSE WE--

WE PULLED
YOUR PHONE RECORDS AND...

LET'S SEE, YOU'VE CALLED
3 TIMES THERE

IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS.

Owen: HUH.

FLEMING, WALLACE...

Frank: DELUCA.

Owen: WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

FLEMING, WALLACE--

OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I DID SOMETHING FOR THEM. A SKIP TRACE.

Frank: A SKIP TRACE.

Owen: MM-HMM.

Frank: DID THAT HAPPEN
TO INVOLVE A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

BLONDE, 5-FOOT-5, 120 POUNDS?

Owen: NAH.
I'D REMEMBER THAT, HUH?


Frank: YOU MIND
IF I LOOK AT YOUR RECORDS?

Owen: SURE.
GOT A WARRANT?

I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,

BUT THOSE RULES ARE THERE
TO PROTECT US

FROM GOVERNMENT HARASSMENT.

Frank:
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

JACKSON FEELS THE SAME WAY.

Owen: IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I GOT TO GO TO THE AIRPORT.

Frank: YEAH, SURE.
LISTEN, UH...

IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING,
GIVE ME A CALL.

THE GIRL'S IN MORE TROUBLE
THAN SHE REALIZES.

APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

Owen: COME ON, LET'S GO.

Girl: THEY KNOW ABOUT ME?

Owen: YEAH.

WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE SPENDING NEXT WEEK

IN A LUXURY HEALTH SPA
IN ARIZONA,

ALL EXPENSES PAID.

GIVE ME SOME CREDIT, KID.

I'VE BEEN AT THIS
A LONG TIME.

COME ON, GET YOUR STUFF.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

Kathy: DID YOU GET
ANYTHING OUT OF HIM?

Frank: NAH, HE'S DANCIN'.

WE'RE NOT GONNA GET IN THERE
WITHOUT A SEARCH WARRANT, THOUGH.

Kathy: YEAH, WELL, I FOUND THIS
IN THE TRASH CAN.

DOESN'T LOOK LIKE KRAMER'S
TYPE OF READING MATERIAL.

Frank: I'LL CHECK IT OUT,
SEE WHAT COMES UP.

Kathy: GOOD.

Kathy: DON'T YOU PEOPLE
EVER SLEEP?

Frank: NO, NEVER.

Kathy: HERE'S YOUR COFFEE LIKE
YOU LIKE IT, BLONDE AND SWEET.

Frank: THANKS.

Kathy: SO,
WHY'D YOU DRAG ME DOWN HERE?

WHAT'S GOIN' ON
WITH THE KRAMER P.I. GUY?

Frank: WELL, HIS RECORD
CHECKS OUT,

AND HIS STORY
CHECKS OUT, TOO.

I, UH-- I REACHED
FLEMING, WALLACE, AND DELUCA.

THEY SAY THAT
KRAMER'S A REGULAR HIRE.

HE ALSO HAS NO CONNECTION
TO RAY JACKSON

OR FRESH START CONSTRUCTION.

NOW, THE MAGAZINE YOU FOUND?

WE RAN THE PRINTS.

NOTHING COULD BE USED.

Kathy: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

WHAT ABOUT THIS ADDRESS
ON THE LABEL--

TOP ONE MODELING AGENCY,
16 DARTMOUTH STREET?

IT'S A GIRLS'
MODELING AGENCY?

Frank: IT'S WORTH A LOOK.

Kathy: ME?

Frank: YOU.

Kathy: I BROUGHT THE COFFEE.

Frank: IT'S YOU. GO.

Kathy: [SIGHS]

Renton Skylar: YEAH,
YOU'VE DEFINITELY GOT POTENTIAL.

COME BACK WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO START.

OH, SORRY, LADY,
YOU ARE DEFINITELY IN THE WRONG PLACE.

Kathy: NO, I REALLY WANTED
TO LOOK AT YOUR CLIENTELE.

I HAVE A PHOTO SHOOT
COMING UP,

AND, UH, I COULD USE
SOME FRESH FACES.

Skylar: COULDN'T WE ALL?
ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN.

LET'S LOOK AT SOME GIRLS.

UH, YOU TWO,
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

Girl: OK.

I'M SURE WE'VE GOT SOME GIRLS
FOR YOU HERE SOMEWHERE.

AH, HERE.

TAKE A PEEK.
THESE ARE AS FRESH AS THEY GET.

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

Kathy: THANKS.

Skylar: SKYLAR.

YEAH, WELL, SHE<i>LOOKED</i>18.

[HANGS UP]

I HATE POLITICIANS.
SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

Kathy: WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

Skylar: UH, NO, NOT HER.

SHE'S, UH,
ON A JOB RIGHT NOW.

Kathy: NO? OH, REALLY?

WELL, I KIND OF
HAD MY HEART SET ON HER.

Skylar: OH, COME ON!
YOU'RE MAKIN' A MESS!

Kathy: LOOK, UM,
SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A BAD TIME.

I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

Skylar: HEY, LADY!

HEY, YOU GOT ANY DAUGHTERS?

Kathy: YOU TWO, OUTTA HERE.

Girl: WHAT?

Second girl: OH!

FRANK? I KNOW HER NAME.
IT'S--

WHAT?

OH, NO.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

Frank: OVER HERE.

16 YEARS OLD.

Kathy:
MY DAUGHTER SUSAN IS 16.

Frank: THEY IDENTIFIED HER
AS HOLLY BRUBAKER.

SHE'S A RUNAWAY
FROM BILLINGS, MONTANA.

Kathy: SHE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT SHE WAS GETTING INTO.

Frank: PHIL AND MANSER MADE A
POSITIVE I.D. OFF THE PHOTO.

Kathy: NOW WE KNOW
OUR KIDNAPPERS ARE MURDERERS.

Frank: THIS LITTLE GIRL
NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT HER.

Kathy: YEAH,
BUT SHE DID KNOW WHO.

TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

I LIFTED THIS
FROM HER MODELING AGENCY.

IT'S HER CONTRACT.

DO YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT THE
NAME OF THE COMPANY THAT HIRED HER?

Frank: "REMARK."
NO, NEVER HEARD OF IT.

Kathy: NEITHER HAVE I,

BUT I KNOW THAT "REMARK"
SPELLS "KRAMER" BACKWARDS.

COULD BE
A COINCIDENCE, BUT...

Frank:
IT'S ENOUGH OF A REASON

TO GIVE KRAMER
ANOTHER VISIT,

MAYBE JAR HIS MEMORY.

[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]

Frank: FREEZE.

HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

TURN YOUR BODY TO THE LEFT
AND WALK INTO THE CAR.

LEGS APART.

Owen: I KNOW MY RIGHTS!
NOW, EITHER BOOK ME

OR GET ME OUT
OF THESE HANDCUFFS!

SEND ME TO THE POLICE STATION!
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOIN'?

Frank: YOU REMEMBER THOSE INTERSECTING
INVESTIGATIONS I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT?

THEY COLLIDED.

YOU KNOW HER?

DO YOU KNOW HER?!

Owen: I RECOGNIZE HER.

OUT-OF-STATE BAIL-JUMPER,

MULTIPLE D.U.I.s.

GUESS SHE GOT BACK
BEHIND THE WHEEL, HUH?

Kathy: SOMEONE GOT BEHIND HER
WITH A TIRE IRON.

Owen: YEAH?

YOU GOT ANYTHING?
PRINTS, WITNESSES, ANYTHING?

Frank: IF WE DID, YOU WOULDN'T
BE WALKIN' OUT OF HERE.

Owen: IS THAT A THREAT?

Frank: ABSOLUTELY.

Owen: IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU AIN'T GOT SQUAT.

Frank: LOOK AT HER.

LOOK AT HER.

WHAT WE HAVE IS A DEAD BODY

AND A VERY NICE YOUNG LADY
WHO'LL BE DEAD BY TOMORROW

IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING
TO STOP IT.

NOW, I WANT RAY JACKSON,
AND I WANT HIM NOW.

Owen: YOU KNOW, BEATIN' UP
GUYS IN HANDCUFFS

IS VERY BAD FOR YOUR IMAGE.

Frank: BOOK HIM.
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

Owen: YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING.

Kathy: NO, YOU SAID THAT.

Susan: OH, NO, THAT'S HER!

THE LIGHT OF MY FREAKISH
BROTHER'S LIFE.

Jenna: LOOK
AT THOSE GLASSES.

I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S COURTNEY'S SISTER.

Susan: I KNOW!
THIS DANCE IS MAJOR.

IF SHE SHOWS UP WITH A MEMBER
OF MY FAMILY LOOKING LIKE THAT,

IT WOULD BE A DISASTER.

Jenna: TOTALLY.
I MEAN, FORGET ABOUT HEAD CHEERLEADER.

Susan: OHH! I REFUSE TO LET LITTLE
MISS EINSTEIN RUIN MY LIFE.

COME ON.
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

Susan: CARLA SOLOMON?
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

Carla: BUT--
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET MY MOTHER HERE.

WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING ME?

Susan: ONE MAKEOVER
COMING UP.

Kathy: HELLO?

ANYBODY HOME?

Kathy: OHH.

GREAT.


OHH.

Susan: OH, HI, MOM.

YOU KNOW JENNA AND MADISON.

Jenna: HEY, MRS. DAVIS.

Susan: AND HAVE YOU
MET CARLA?

Carla: NICE TO MEET YOU,
MRS. DAVIS.

Kathy: SUCH A PLEASURE.
HOW ARE YOU?

Carla: I'M GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

Kathy: GOOD.

Carla: THAT'S GOOD.


Jack: OOH! [LAUGHS]

OHH! WELL, SCRATCH ONE
POTENTIAL SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT.

I TOLD YOU A ROCKET ENGINE
WOULDN'T WORK ON A MODEL AIRPLANE.

Nick: CARLA?

Nick: YOU LOOK LIKE
A CHEERLEADER.

Carla: AND DO YOU LIKE IT?

Nick: WELL,
IT'S, UM, DIFFERENT.

WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU LIKE IT?

Carla: I LIKE IT.
NOW, CAN I SEE YOUR PROJECT?

Nick: OK. IT DOESN'T LOOK
TOO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

Susan: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

Susan: SEE? I TOLD YOU.

NOT ALL COOL KIDS
WANT TO BE SMART,

BUT ALL SMART KIDS
WANT TO BE COOL.

Jack: THERE'S
SOMETHING TO BE SAID

FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF SOCIAL SKILLS.

Susan: SKILLS? YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN CARLA AT THE MALL.

HER OWN MOTHER DIDN'T
EVEN RECOGNIZE HER.

SHE SAID SHE FORGOT.

SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT FLOOR
TO PICK HER UP ON.

Kathy: WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

Susan: THAT SHE MADE UP
SOME LAME EXCUSE

ABOUT WHAT FLOOR
SHE'D MEET US ON.

Kathy: OHH! THANK YOU!

YOU JUST HELPED ME SOLVE A PUZZLE
THAT'S BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY!

Susan: OK.

Kathy: HEY, MAC.
CAN I COME IN, TALK TO YOU?

Kathy: THANKS.

Mac: ANYBODY EVER
TELL YOU ANYTHING

ABOUT RIDING ALONE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

Kathy: YEAH, BUT I'M THE TYPE
OF PERSON WHO BELIEVES

THAT NEIGHBORHOODS
AND PEOPLE

AREN'T AS BAD
AS THEY'RE MADE OUT TO BE.

LIKE YOU, FOR INSTANCE.

Mac: WHO, ME?

Kathy: YEAH. I CHECKED.

YOUR BIG FELONY RECORD?
THAT ARMED ROBBERY CONVICTION?

TURNS OUT TO BE
AN ANCIENT ACCESSORY BEEF

FROM A BOTCHED
CONVENIENCE STORE HOLDUP

THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN DO.

OTHERWISE, THE NAVY SEALS
WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU

OR GIVEN YOU
AN HONORABLE TICKET, RIGHT?

Mac: SO, I WAS STUPID
WHEN I WAS 16. SO WHAT?

Kathy: YEAH, WELL,

I DON'T THINK
HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY FIRED YOU.

I THINK YOU QUIT.

Mac: WHY WOULD I QUIT?

Kathy: WELL, BECAUSE
THEY IMMEDIATELY BLAMED YOU

FOR CAROLINE RAPHAELSON'S
DISAPPEARANCE,

AND THAT TICKED YOU OFF.

Mac: THEY CAN BLAME ME
AS MUCH AS THEY WANT.

WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT
SOME RICH WHITE LADY?

Kathy:
I THINK YOU DO CARE, MAC.

I THINK YOU LIKED HER.

I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO
SEE HER HURT OR KILLED.

LOOK, MAC,
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

Mac: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
PAYING YOU AT THE CSA,

BUT THEY SURE ARE GETTING
THEIR MONEY'S WORTH.

Mac: YEAH, YOU KNOW,
UM, AHEM...

I LIKED MS. RAPHAELSON.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

SHE WASN'T ONE
OF THE KINDS WHO, UM,

STAYED AT THE MANICURIST'S
OR HAIR SALON ALL DAY,

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

SHE'S A SCUBA DIVER, TOO.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

SHE WAS REALLY GOOD, TOO.
DEEP DIVES. OPEN WATER.

SHE EVEN EXPLORED CAVES.
REALLY GOOD DIVER.

WE USED TO FLASH
DIVING SIGNS TO EACH OTHER.

SCUBA DIVERS SAY "OK"
LIKE THIS.

BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE UNDERWATER,
THIS MEANS YOU'RE GOING UP.

Kathy: OH. I CAN SEE WHY
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA CONFUSE 'EM.

Mac: YOU KNOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

YOU ASKED ME IF I WAS SURE
THAT IT WAS MS. RAPHAELSON

THAT WAS ROLLED INTO
THE ELEVATOR ON FRIDAY MORNING?

IT WOULD'VE HAD TO
HAVE BEEN, BECAUSE, UM,

WHEN SHE LEFT,
SHE DID JUST LIKE THIS.

YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF NOW.

NOBODY ELSE
WOULD'VE DONE THAT.

Kathy: THANK YOU.

THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW.

OH, WAIT.

DID ANNA REICHMAN
EVER MENTION HER MOTHER

OR THE EXPENSIVE JEWELS
SHE GAVE HER, EVER?

Mac: NO. NO. SHE, UM,

SAID HER MOM DIED
WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

Kathy: WHY DOES
THAT NOT SURPRISE ME?

YOU KNOW, MAC,

THE CSA COULD ALWAYS USE
A FORMER NAVY SEAL.

WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO BRING YOU AN APPLICATION?

Mac: YEAH, SURE. CAN I PUT YOU
DOWN AS A REFERENCE?

Kathy: YEAH. YEAH.

Alex: TOMMY.
COME HERE A SECOND.

WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM
OUR FAVORITE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR?

Tommy: NOTHIN' YET.

Alex: WHAT'S HE WAITIN'
SO LONG FOR?

WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO
WHEN A MAN WON'T STEP FORWARD

TO SAVE HIS KIDNAPPED WIFE?

Tommy: MAYBE THEY DON'T
GET ALONG TOO WELL

AND HE'S HAPPY TO HAVE
THE HOUSE TO HIMSELF.

Alex: GIVE IT
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

DO YOUR BEST TO STAY
ON TOP OF IT.

Tommy: NO PROBLEM, BOSS.

Wilbur: DID YOU FIND
MISS ANNA?

Kathy: NO, NO, NO. I DIDN'T
THINK SHE'D BE AT HOME,

AND I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D BE AT WORK EITHER.

Wilbur: IS THAT WHY YOU WANTED ME
TO MEET YOU IN THE PARKING GARAGE?

Kathy: OH, NO, NO, NO.
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK

SOMETHING OUT DOWN HERE
BEFORE I FILED MY REPORT.

Wilbur:
AND DID IT CHECK OUT?

OK, THEN.

Kathy: WAIT, WAIT!
NO, NO. COME BACK.

NO, I WANTED
TO ASK YOU, UM--

Wilbur: OK.

Kathy: THINK
ABOUT FRIDAY MORNING

WHEN YOU PUT MRS. RAPHAELSON
IN THE WHEELCHAIR.

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN REMEMBER,

ANYTHING AT ALL?

JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND PICTURE HOW IT HAPPENED.

Wilbur: IT-- IT'S MY JOB
TO GET THE WHEELCHAIR READY

AND MAKE SURE THE PATIENTS
ARE COMFORTABLE.

OH, THERE WAS SOMETHING.

THE FOOTRESTS WERE STICKY,

AND I TOLD MYSELF, "BE SURE
TO PUT THE OIL ON THEM."

I EVEN WROTE "OIL" ON MY HAND
SO I WOULDN'T FORGET.

MISS ANNA TOOK MRS. R.
TO THE CAR,

AND WHEN SHE BROUGHT
THE CHAIR BACK,

I WENT TO PUT THE OIL ON,

BUT THE FOOTRESTS
WEREN'T STICKY AFTER ALL.

DOES THAT SOUND DUMB?

Kathy: NO.

THAT'S THE SMARTEST THING
I'VE HEARD ALL DAY.

THANK YOU, WILBUR.

Wilbur: BYE.

Kathy: BYE, WILBUR.

Wilbur: BYE!

Kathy: FRANK,
NOW I KNOW FOR SURE

WHO KIDNAPPED
CAROLINE RAPHAELSON.

IT WAS THE NURSE,
ANNA REICHMAN.

WOW! GREAT SUIT.
DO YOU HAVE A HOT DATE?

Frank: NO, NO. IT'S JUST
THE FLEMING SHINDIG THING.

I'M JUST TRYING
TO SUPPORT PHIL.

WHAT-- WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

Kathy: OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
ANNA, ANNA.

SEE, I LIKED HER FOR IT
EVER SINCE I SAW HER JEWELRY.

YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T DO SAPPHIRES
ON A BUDGET. I'VE TRIED.

OH, GOD. IT WAS SO EASY.
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT

UNTIL I REALIZED
<i>WHEN</i>THE SWITCH WAS MADE.

NOW, YOU REMEMBER,

ANNA WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK
CAROLINE TO THE ELEVATOR.

[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

Kathy: WELL, SHE MUST'VE PUSHED
THE BUTTON, NOT TO LEVEL 2,

WHERE THE LIMO WAS,
BUT TO LEVEL ONE.

[CAROLINE GASPS]

Caroline: WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

Anna: TAKE IT EASY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. UH-HUH.

OK. GOOD. GOOD GIRL.

Owen: COME ON, COME ON.

Anna: YEAH. UH-HUH.

Owen: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HER
OUT OF HERE. COME ON! COME ON!

Anna: YOU JUST RELAX.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

Owen: LET'S GO! LET'S GO!
GET HER THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

SO IT WOULD'VE TAKEN NO TIME
AT ALL TO MAKE THE SWITCH,

AND THEN ANNA CONTINUED
DOWN TO LEVEL 2...

Kathy: AND WHEELED HOLLY
TO THE LIMO.

AND OFF THEY WENT
TO DR. MANSER'S OFFICE.

Kathy: WILBUR REALIZED THAT THE STICKY
FOOTRESTS WEREN'T STICKY ANYMORE

'CAUSE IT WASN'T
THE SAME CHAIR.

Frank: WELL, THAT EXPLAINS WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE REAL WHEELCHAIR.

BUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE REAL CAROLINE?

Anna: HERE YOU GO.

YOU NEED TO TAKE
SOME FLUIDS.

THAT'LL HELP
FLUSH YOUR SYSTEM.

Anna: THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

Caroline: I HURT.

Anna:
I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND.

YOU JUST REST.

EVERYTHING IS WORKING OUT
JUST FINE.

Caroline: SO SLEEPY.

Phil: FRANK.

YOU CAN FORGET
THE INVESTIGATION.

I'VE DECIDED TO DROP THE CHARGES
AGAINST RAY JACKSON.

Frank:
PHIL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

Phil: I HAVE TO!
CAROLINE IS MY LIFE.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT NAILING
JACKSON ANYMORE.

Frank: PHIL, WE HAVE
EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE

THAT HE'S HOLDING
YOUR WIFE HOSTAGE.

Kathy: UH, ACTUALLY,
NOT REALLY.

I MEAN,
JACKSON'S THE RANSOM,

BUT WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT
HE'S ACTUALLY A KIDNAPPER.

Phil: WELL, WHO ELSE BUT JACKSON
WOULD'VE MADE ALL THOSE RANSOM DEMANDS?

Kathy: WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
BUT HERE'S ANOTHER.

WHY WOULD A MAN WHO HAS 50 CAREER
CRIMINALS AT HIS FINGERTIPS

HIRE AN OUTSIDE NURSE
AND A P.I.

FOR SUCH A DELICATE JOB?

IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, PHIL.

Phil: I KNOW YOU'VE BOTH
DONE THE BEST JOB YOU CAN,

BUT THE STAKES
ARE TOO HIGH.

FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,
I'M DISMISSING THE CHARGES

AGAINST RAY JACKSON
WITH PREJUDICE.

Frank: PHIL, LISTEN,
YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT.

OK? WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

RIGHT NOW,
LET'S GO TO THE PARTY.

Phil: I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS CHARADE.

Frank: LOOK, HEY,
WE GOT EVERYTHING COVERED, OK?

WE GO TO THE PARTY. WE'LL MAKE
IT SHORT AND SWEET, ALL RIGHT?

LET'S GO.

KEEP LOOKING.

SEE IF YOU CAN CONNECT RAY
JACKSON TO ANNA REICHMAN.

Kathy: OK.

Marvin: ANNA REICHMAN?

Kathy: YES, YES, YES.

LET'S CHECK OUT
HER BANK RECORDS,

SEE IF THERE'S BEEN
ANY BIG DEPOSITS LATELY.

Marvin: WHO'S WRITING HER
ALL THESE CHECKS?

GOT IT.

PARK FIELDS
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION

FOR CONSULTING SERVICES?
NICE AND VAGUE.

Kathy: PARK FIELDS.
PULL IT UP.

THAT NAME WAS ALL OVER
RAY JACKSON'S OFFICE.

Marvin: SO, REICHMAN'S
WORKING FOR JACKSON?

Kathy: I DON'T THINK SO,

BUT MAYBE THEY WERE GETTING
PAID BY THE SAME PERSON.

Marvin: PARK FIELDS
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.

Kathy: YES, EXACTLY.

SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

Marvin: GOT IT.

Marvin: NO. NO.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE ON THE BOARD.

Kathy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
LOOK AT THE C.E.O.

I'M GOING TO A PARTY.

THAT'S THE WRONG FACE
UP THERE.

WAIT FOR MY CALL.

Kathy: OH, HONEY!

YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME
IN A SUIT.

YOU SHOULD WEAR ONE
MORE OFTEN.

Jack: ONLY WHEN I HAVE
TO CHAPERONE A DANCE.

YOU WANT TO COME?

Kathy: I DID IT LAST YEAR.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

Jack: NICK, SUSAN,
WE GOTTA ROLL!

Kathy: YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE!

YOU LOOK SO CUTE, BABY.

Nick: I LOOK LIKE A DORK.

Susan: YOU ARE A DORK.

Kathy and Jack: SUSAN.

Nick: CAN I STAY
AT QUENTIN'S TONIGHT?

Susan: I'M STAYING
AT JENNA'S.

Kathy: I LIKE YOUR BROTHER'S
APPROACH BETTER,

BUT, YES. BYE.

Jack: BYE, HONEY.

Kathy: BYE!

Kathy: ALL RIGHT, MARVIN.
LET'S GO.

IT'S ME, JANE.

Marvin: WOW.

BOY LIKE JANE.

[JANE LAUGHS]

Kathy: THANK YOU.

Kathy: OK.

WHOA.

DON'T YOU HAVE TO BUY ME
DINNER BEFORE YOU DO THAT?

[KATHY LAUGHS]

Kathy: THANK YOU.

Parker: JORDAN HERE IS ONE OF
YOUR MOST INFLUENTIAL SUPPORTERS.

Phil: OH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

Parker: HE'S CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
CAMPAIGN IN A NUMBER OF AREAS.

AND I THINK
HE'S GOING TO TRY...

Kathy: OH. THANK YOU.

Frank: WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

THANK YOU.

Frank: UM, MISS, ARE YOU
HERE BY YOURSELF?

Kathy: ARE YOU TRYING
TO PICK ME UP?

Frank: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

Kathy: WE'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE, FRANK.

Frank: OK, I'M LISTENING.
GO AHEAD.

Kathy: PARKER FLEMING
WAS PAYING OFF ANNA REICHMAN.

Frank: YOU THINK PARKER FLEMING
HAD ANNA REICHMAN

KIDNAP
HIS BEST FRIEND'S WIFE

AND THEN FRAME RAY JACKSON,
HIS OWN CLIENT, FOR THE CRIME?

Kathy: YEAH.
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE CRAZY,

BUT IT MAKES SENSE.

Frank: I'M NOT SAYING
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

Kathy: LOOK, FRANK,
YOU GOTTA CALL IN YOUR BOYS.

Frank: LOOK,
IF THIS IS TRUE,

WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PROVE IT.

Kathy: I'M WORKIN' ON IT.
GO BACK TO YOUR BLONDE.

Kathy: WOW.

Caroline, groggily:
WHO ARE YOU?

Kathy: UH, I'M HERE TO TAKE
YOU OUT OF HERE. COME ON.

Caroline: HOW DO WE DO THAT?

Kathy: WE WALK, CAROLINE.
COME ON.

UP, UP, UP!
OHH! UP, UP, UP!

LEGS OVER HERE.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

OOH. THAT'S KIND
OF CONSPICUOUS.

OK. JUST HOLD ON.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

UP, UP, UP, UP! UP!

COME ON, COME ON.

GOOD MORNING.
HERE WE GO. ARMS UP!

EXCELLENT. GOOD WORK.

SHAME ON YOU.

YOU'RE WAY TOO PRETTY
TO DO ANYTHING TO YOUR FACE.

WELL...

THAT'S STYLISH IN
A DESPERATE SORT OF WAY. NO!

NO, NO. COME ON. LET'S GO.

LET'S GO. COME ON. LET'S GO.

UH-UH. ONE FOOT
AHEAD OF THE OTHER.

WE'LL PUT A MARTINI
IN YOUR HAND,

YOU'LL LOOK
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

Caroline, groggily:
WHERE AM I? WHO ARE YOU?

Kathy: UH, I-- I WORK
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

YOU KNOW THAT PHRASE,
"HELP IS ON THE WAY"?

I'M PRETTY MUCH IT.

OK.

Kathy: YOU JUST
WAIT HERE FOR ME, OK?

I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

Kathy: EXCUSE ME, OFFICER?

THERE'S A DRUNKEN SENATOR
IN THAT BEDROOM,

AND HE'S GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

I THINK YOU SHOULD
CHECK ON HIM.

Kathy: COME ON.
UP, UP! THERE YOU GO.

TURN AROUND. THERE YOU GO.

RELAX, RIGHT UP HERE.
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

Parker: JOHN! YOU MADE IT!

IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

HEH HEH. AHEM.

Parker: ALEX. WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

Kathy: MR. BIG.

Alex: WE NEED TO TALK,
MR. FLEMING.

Kathy: OHH!

Kathy, whispering:
Go in here.

Kathy:
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GO?

OK, OK, OK.

HERE. HERE.

Parker: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
IMPORTANT THIS EVENT IS TONIGHT

FOR THE FUTURE
OF OUR ORGANIZATION?

Alex: WITHOUT MY MONEY,
THERE WOULD BE NO ORGANIZATION.

SO LET'S GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS.

I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE
ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY.

Parker: GOOD.

Alex: AS YOU KNOW, THE CSA STILL
HASN'T RELEASED RAY JACKSON.

WE NEED A NEW FRONT. NOW.

Parker: WELL, IT'LL TAKE ME SOME TIME
TO FIND ANOTHER SETUP LIKE THIS.

Alex: OH, I HOPE NOT,
FOR YOUR SAKE.

I DON'T WANT THERE
TO BE ANOTHER INTERRUPTION.

Caroline: P-PARKER?

Alex: WHO IS THIS WOMAN?!

Parker: I DON'T KNOW.

Caroline: WHAT'S HAPPENING?

Alex: THIS IS
PHIL RAPHAELSON'S WIFE?!

Parker: OH, MY DEAR.

Alex:
AND WHO'S THIS WOMAN?!

Kathy: ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THE BAR,

REALLY. OH!

WHOO! HI! [CHUCKLES]

Parker: ARE YOU
ON THE GUEST LIST?

Kathy:
YEAH, I KNOW PHIL. I--

Alex: I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

DEAL WITH HER!
NICE OPERATION.

I'LL BE SURE
AND TELL MY ASSOCIATES.

UNACCEPTABLE
IN MY ORGANIZATION.

Kathy: YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

Parker: OH, I THINK I DO.

YOU'RE WORKING
FOR DARNELL. OHH!

Frank: ACTUALLY,
WE WORK TOGETHER.

Kathy: SO YOU KIDNAPPED
THIS WOMAN

AND THEN FINANCED
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S CAMPAIGN

WITH YOUR DIRTY MONEY, HUH?

Parker: NOBODY'S PERFECT,
SWEETHEART.

Kathy: MARVIN,
DID YOU GET ALL THAT?

Marvin:
LOUD AND CLEAR, JANE.

LOUD AND CLEAR.

Kathy: THINK HE DID.

Frank: LET'S GO, COUNSELOR.

Kathy: OK?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

Frank: GO!

[WOMEN SCREAMING]

Kathy: YOU DID CALL
FOR BACKUP. THANKS.

Frank: ANY TIME.

Officer: LET'S GO!

Agent: WATCH YOUR HEAD, SIR.

Man: WE'RE READY
TO EXECUTE THAT WARRANT.

Phil: HERE. KEEP THIS ON.
STAY WITH ME.

I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

Kathy: OH, WE WERE
JUST DOING OUR JOB.

Caroline: THANK YOU
SO MUCH, MISS...

Kathy: UH, JANE. JANE DOE.

Frank: LET'S GET YOU HOME.

Phil: WATCH YOUR HEAD.

Frank: YOU KNOW, I FEEL
RESPONSIBLE THAT RAY JACKSON

IS SITTING IN A CELL
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

EVEN THOUGH THE MONEY WAS LAUNDERED
THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY,

I DON'T THINK
HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

Phil: WE'RE GONNA RELEASE HIM
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

Frank: YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A MORAL TO THIS STORY.

Phil: OH, YEAH. WHAT IS IT?

Frank:
YOU CAN NEVER TRUST A LAWYER.

Phil: I'LL TRY
TO REMEMBER THAT.

Frank: I'LL SEE YOU.

Frank: WELL, I THINK
WE CAN CALL IT A NIGHT.

Kathy: THIS PARTY'S
KIND OF OVER, HUH?

Frank: YOU WERE GREAT
IN THERE.

Kathy: SO WERE YOU.

Frank: SEE YOU AROUND.

Kathy: MAYBE.

Kathy: HEY, FRANK.

HEY, YOU KNOW,
THAT TUX IS PRETTY HOT.

YOU SHOULD KEEP IT
IN YOUR PLAYBOOK.

Jack: HONEY? NICK'S DATE
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

SUSAN'S REPUTATION
REMAINS INTACT.

Jack: WELL, HELLO, GORGEOUS.

Kathy: WE'RE ALL ALONE...

FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

Jack: LOOKS THAT WAY.

[KATHY LAUGHS]

Kathy: NICE.

[JACK AND KATHY LAUGH]
