<i>Before war...</i>

<i>New York...</i>

<i>Before I was born.</i>

<i>The place I've only seen pictures of.</i>

<i>I know you...</i>

<i>but we've never meet.</i>

<i>I'm with you...</i>

<i>but I don't know your name.</i>

<i>I know I'm dreaming...</i>

<i>but it feels like more than that.</i>

<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

<i>How can that be?</i>

<i>March 14, 2077.</i>

<i>Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

<i>And I'm still haunted by these dreams.</i>

<i>Victoria and I were assigned together.</i>

<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll join the others.</i>

<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

<i>It's been half a century
since the scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

<i>Forced to leave their own dying planet,</i>

<i>they came to take ours.</i>

<i>Without the moon,
the Earth was thrown into chaos.</i>

<i>Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.</i>

<i>Tsunamis wiped out what we make.</i>

<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

<i>We used the nukes.</i>

<i>We won the war, but lost the planet.</i>

<i>Left it contaminated.</i>

<i>Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the earth.</i>

<i>We built the Tet, our mission control.</i>

<i>The Temporary Space Station
before the migration to Titan.</i>

<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

<i>Well... almost every one.</i>

Thank you for the coffee.

<i>Remainants of the scavengers army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

<i>They attack our drones at night.</i>

<i>They try to kill me during the day.</i>

<i>They're still fighting them, but I don't know why.</i>

<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

<i>And we are an effective team.</i>

<i>Vica's my communication officer.</i>

<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

<i>And I handle drone maintenance.</i>

<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

<i>Vica can't wait to go.</i>

<i>Me? I'm not so sure.</i>

<i>I can't shake the feeling that Earth,</i>

<i>in spite of all that's happened,
Earth is still my home.</i>

Jack Harper, Tech 49

Morning, Bob!

<i>Tower, call check!</i>

<i>Drone maintenance technician 49,
Hydro Rig support.</i>

All Bobby ship system are green.

I'm good to go.

Copy Tech-49, you're clear,
be careful out there.

Always am.
No, you're not.

You're right.

I gotta work on that.

Alright, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.

Relay Hydro Rig coordinates now.
Contact visual.

I got them.
Hydro Rigs are sucking sea water.

You got them, Bob?

Drone 185 looks good.

Jack, we've got two drones down.

Shit!

Stand by! Mission coming online.

<i>Okay, Tet contact.</i>

Morning, boss.

Tower 49, this is mission control.

How are you feeling this lovely morning?

Another day in paradise, Sally.

Uploading data now.

49 mission log, day 1642,
Hydro Rig support.

I have two...
Two drones offline,

perimeter's compromised.

Copy that. Relaying to Tet, stand by.

Jack. 166 is down in grid 37.

Linking to beacon now.

You go there first.

Got it. On my way.

Tech 49 is on route to grid 37 now.

Can you plug that hole with drone 109?

Negative. 109 is in the dock.

Still waiting for parts.

Jack's better find those drones and get them flying.

Those rigs can't be exposed overnight.

Copy that.

Tower, did he fixed 166 recently?

Jack has fixed all the drones recently.

And if we had the parts
that we'd been asking for,

we wouldn't be running
a skeleton grid down here.

Understood. We're doing the best we can.

Are you an effective team?
We are an effective team.

Your directive today is to
rehabilitate 166 and find 172.

Get them flying by Sunday,

and I'll buy you two rounds of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.

You'd better be ready, Sally.
Two weeks now.

Well I'm keeping track.

Well, glad to be here, buddy.

Tech-49.

Tech-49.

Jack?

Copy Tower.

What happened? I lost you for a second.

Really?

Coming up on location.

There it is.

We have multiple scav kills.

Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.

Got any movement?

No sign of scavenger activity.

I've got a limited visibility here, Jack.
You should handle this mission.

<i>Copy that.</i>

I am coming in now.

Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

Always do.

You know, I've read about this game.

It was played right here.

The last Super Bowl.

Please don't tell me it was a classic.
Classic game.

Ahead by 4.

<i>The ball...</i>

It was on the 50 yard line.

Seconds left on the clock.

Ball was snapped.

QB fumbles.

Disaster.

Looks like the game is over.

I'm reading the whole
central core off alignment,

you don't have the necessary
tools down there.

<i>A new fuel cell's not gonna fix that.</i>

But this QB runs back-
Jack.

<i>picks up his own fumble.</i>
Hold on, what did you just do?

<i>A wall of linebackers closing in on him.</i>

<i>So he throws a long ball,</i>

<i>with no idea who is at the other end.</i>

Hail Mary.

80,000 people on their feet,
watching this ball sail through the air!

And down field...

would be wild receiver, first strike,

just leaps out of the back...

Touch Down!

Contact! West contact!

Jack?

It's okay, Vica.

It's just a dog.

Now go away!
Get out of here!

Go on! Get out of here!
Go!

Tech 49 Jack Harper.

You're welcome.

166 back online.

<i>Two drones shot down today.</i>

10 fuel cell stolen in just over a month,

these scavs are getting bolder.

<i>Well, Hydro Rigs are taking all the bullshit.</i>

Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

<i>This is bullshit!</i>

We won the war.
And we have to leave.

Two more weeks, Jack.

And we'll be on our way to Titan.

Yeah.

That drone is out there somewhere.

We just have to find him.

Without a beacon, it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

For it we go our ground game.

Tower.

Located 172...

in a sinkhole.

No visual but I can hear it.

Tet so far off angle, I can barely see you.
How does it look?

It's good! It's good! There's no sign
of scav activity on top.

<i>Tet's offline in 15 minutes.</i>

<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

<i>Mission, this is Tower 49.</i>

<i>Jack has located drone 172.</i>

<i>Engage recovery now.</i>

Requesting backup to his location ASAP.

I've got a visual on drone 172.

Jack?

What the hell?

Shit!

Jack!

Tech 49 Jack Harper.

Jack Harper Tech 49.

Oh, come on!

Not my goddamn bike!

"And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,

For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his Gods?"

Jack.

Yeah!
I'll be right there.

<i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>

How does 109 look?

Can it fly?
Barely.

But without armor she's a sitting duck.

Well I'll talk to Sally about that
shielding in the morning.

Again.

What, Jack Harper?

Where did you get this?

It was growing, and...

Come on Jack, you know the regulations,

we don't need a mistake, we have
no idea what kind of toxins

could be on something like that.

It's a flower, Vica....
Yeah, that's not the point.

It's that we are so close to the end,

and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk.

Okay.

Every day you have to go down there.

And see what was lost.

But we've done our job, Jack.

It's time to go.

I don't think they were trying to kill me today.

The Scavs.

They were trying to catch me.

I can't have you.

Come on.

You should come with me some time.
Before we leave.

There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

I'll show you something.

Oh, my God...

It was a six stage melt-down
from inside the Hydro Rigs core.

It's offline permanently.

Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.

I need to know exactly what happened.

Jack claims the scavs weaponised
one of the stolen fuel cells

and got it into the suction.

Tower, hold!

Tower?

I've got a rogue signal in grid 370.
You seeing this?

Yes!

It's gotta be scav.

It's not one of ours.

Jack.

The signal's being directed off planet.

On my way.

Tower, our logs show, you are missing
an additional 9 fuel cells. Can you confirm?

Negative mission, that number is 10.

Drone 172 was lost last night.

109 is combat ready since you get that shield ring.

We can cover the remaining rigs with drones
in the field. I've run the numbers.

We're using the numbers in the field, Tower.

I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.

Copy.

Our job is to run those rigs,
your directive is to maintain them.

We cannot afford to lose another.

Do you copy?

Copy.

Are you and Jack an effective team?

Damn right, we are!

Jack?

You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

Jack?

Yeah, I got it.

It's some kind of repeater.

The scavs are using a
building as an antenna.

Can you decrypt?

It's a sort of coordinates.

Grid 17.

It's a goddamn holy beacon.

Grid 17.

What the hell is out there?

Nothing!
It's in the middle of nowhere!

What is going on?

Why would the scavs
send a signal off planet, Jack?

I'm shutting it down.

Tech-49, check your course.
You're headed right for the border.

That radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it.

It's okay Vica, I see it.

I'm gonna do a perimeter check...

before I head home.

I may go off comm.

Jack, we should keep in contact.
Just let me know where you are.

Do you copy?

Jack, do you copy?

That's right, Bob.

You know where we're going!

You're gonna miss me?

I'm gonna miss this place.

It would've been great.

Vica! Vica, did you get that?

Jack, where have you been?

An object came down in 17.

That's the beacon coordinates.

Exactly.
I saw it...

It's some sort of vessel.

Jack, Mission's almost offline.
I'm under it now.

Mission, we have an unidentified
object impact in 17,

it came down to coordinates sent by
a scav beacon. My tech's on route now.

Tower, we're going offline soon,

but drones are already mobile and executing.

Have your tech stand down.

Copy.

Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.

That's a negative, Tower!

With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.

I want to know this site is secure!

Sally, my Tech is concerned
about the security of the site.

Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.

Keep your tech out of it. Do you copy..?
Copy. Command, I...

Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this!

I'm on site.

Jack, the drones have eyes on you.

Command's offline.

I think it's one of ours.

This thing is ancient, it looks...

pre-war!

This is scavs, they brought this thing down, Jack!

There's no sign of scavs.

Technician, this is your control.
I order you to pull out

and return to the Tower immediately.

Touching down!

They are human!

Tower, we've got survivors.

There are four, check it, five survivors.

They are human!

Stand down!

Vica, the drones are firing at survivors.
Jack, the Tet's offline, I....

I don't have control!

Stand down!

Jack Harper, Tech-49

Back off, you son of a bitch!

Back off!

Open the door!

Vica!

Get the med case.

Get the med case!

This has to be reported.

Then you should report that the drones
killed the crew from one of our own ships.

See what Command makes of that.

It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

Jack...

Here. You're still dehydrated.

Where are we?

I'm Victoria.

This is Jack.

What's your name?

Julia.

Julia...

I'm sorry for what I have to tell you...

But you were on a crash.

Your ship came down.

Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.

But none of your crew survived.

What do you mean?

You're the only one that made it.

I'm sorry.

You've been in delta sleep for a long time.

Some disorientation is normal.

How long?

60 years.

At least.

I have to get back to the ship.

It's too dangerous down there,
you need to rest.

Vica...

Don't touch me!

Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon.

From the surface.

You know anything about that?

What was your mission?

It's classified.

But we have no record of an Odyssey's...

I can't tell you anything until I get
the flight recorder from my ship.

Julia,

a lot's changed in 60 years.

When you were in delta sleep,

Earth was attacked.

We call them scavs.

They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

Then they invaded.

We won the war.

But Earth was ruined.

Everyone's on Titan now.
That's the moon of Saturn, we're on the...

space station getting ready to go.

We're here for the security
and drone maintenance.

We're the mop-up crew.

You lost people. Everything.

If you want to be alone, we understand.

The drones killed her entire crew.

If I hadn't gotten there...
I want her gone first thing.

Vica...

Do you have any memories before the mission?

Before the security wipe?

Our job is not to remember.

Remember?

Do you remember her?

Jack...

That was a scav beacon that brought her down.

We don't know who she is.

Or what she is.

Let's just get trough the night.

Okay?

You fly that thing?

Yes.

What happens now?

Tet will be online soon...

Victoria will report your rescue.

And they'll send someone down for you.

From the Tet?

Yes.

I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.

The scavs, they move at night.

They could be all over...
I need to know what happened.

You need to know what happened.

Please!

Jack. What are you doing?

Vica, she is a flight officer.

She wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder.

Now you'd want the same thing.
<i>Jack...</i>

I can't protect you.

Yeah, I understand.

This one's on me.

I couldn't save them.

Jack. Jack!

Jack, can you hear me?

Alright, it's time to go.

Jack!

I found it.

Jack!

Tower 49, how are you all this lovely morning?

Another day in paradise.

Sally...

Jack...

took a pre-doom patrol,

and...

went off comm.

Near the canyons in 17.

Now, I know we're low on drones.

But, um...

Requesting one to sweep the area.

Just a quick scout!

Copy 49, tasking 185 to grid 22.

And how can a man die better
Than facing fearful odds,

For the ashes of his fathers,

And the temples of his gods?

I've been watching you, Jack.

You're curious.

What are you looking for in those books?

Maybe it will bring back old memories?

You won't get anything from me.

My memory's been wiped to protect...

Security of your mission? Yes.

You can't have your precious memory
falling into the wrong hands, now can you?

Tell me.

Have you ever met a...

Scav up-close?

Of course not.

You just repair drones.

Don't go in to the radiation zone.

Don't ask too many question.

A part of the job description.

Lights!

We are not aliens, Jack.

We are human.

Of course for us, being human is a problem.

Old steel fighter tech.

Shielder from your scanners.

Focus scrambler.

Keeps your drones confused.

Well...

Most of the time.

The drones are programmed...
To kill humans, Jack!

You saw what they did to those sleep box.

You almost got yourself

blown to bits protecting that woman.

Why did you do that?

Anyone would have.

Anyone?

Interesting...
We're wasting our time.

The drone will track him here.

Sergeant Sykes.

He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.

I hope you'll prove him wrong.

Mission, I'm picking up a biotrack
somewhere near the west canyons,

can you confirm the sequence?

Stand by.

DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

Vica, you're okay?

Everything good between you two?

Of course!

You're still an effective team?

We're great!

Never better.

We were running a ground
game and losing.

So we decided, what the hell.

We gotta throw the long ball.

It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.

That's how you brought down the Odyssey.

Why?

The Odyssey's compact reactor.

Courtesy of NASA, very hard to come by.

You liked the show last night?

And it was just one fuel cell.

Imagine what 10 of them will do.

With the core of weapon's grade plutonium.

We have a nuke.

We have a drone to carry it.

But we can't access it.

It doesn't know who we are.

But it knows you, Jack.

We need you to program the drone

that will carry our nuke to the Tet.

End this war.

There are people up there.

Sergeant...

Program the drone to return to the Tet.

It needs to go right to the center.

Screw you!

We haven't got time for this.

No!

Let's go!
Get him out.

185 just went off grid.
Copy Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

Permission to task two additional drones?

If one drone is here, more will come.

They won't stop till they find me.

They'll turn this place to dust.

But if you let us go, I'll call them off.

It's your only chance.

I've been to your radiation zone.

If you're looking for the truth...

that's where you're gonna find it.

You risk all our lives.

Everything.

Why do you think he is different?

She does!

Mission,

I found my tech over 37.

You can call off the search.

Copy that Tower, glad Jack's safe.

Tasking the unit drones, back to rig support.

Where're we going?

Who are you?

What aren't you telling me?

Jack...
What were you doing on the Odyssey?

What was your mission?

It's was a research flight to Titan.

My first.

That's what it was supposed to be!

Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners
picked up an alien object.

We were re-assigned to investigate.

They put us all in delta. They must have...

woken you and Victoria first.

What?

That object...

was the Tet, Jack.

The Tet was our mission.

That's impossible!

That's impossible!

Who are you?

I'm your wife...

I don't know what happened!

But you're not who you think you are.

Jack, we were here.

You asked me to meet you.

You brought me up on top of the world.

I could tell you were nervous that day.

It was right here, Jack.

You said...

Look through here...

And I'll show you the future.

And I hold up a ring.

And you said...
Yes!

There you are.

There you are.

Vica, I'm coming in!

Do not report to Mission
till I get back, do you copy?

Do you copy?

Vica, open the door.

Stay away from me.

I don't want to hear.

It not safe here, and we need to leave now.

It was always her.

Wasn't it?

Vica...

She's my wife.

Mission, this is Tower 49.

Go ahead, 49.

No...
I'm having a problem with my technician.

You don't know what are you doing!
He found a survivor on the crash site.

Vica, listen to me!
She's impeding his abilities.

And he's unfit for service.

I'm sorry to hear that, Vica.

Are you still an effective team?

Vica...

Open the door, Vica!

No.

We are not an effective team.

Vica, please.

You know we have to go now.

No, I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack!

There's a place I know...

We'll be safe.

I'm going to Titan.

There is no Titan.

They were lying to us.

Just stay away from me!

Vica, please.

There are things...
Things you need to know.

I don't want to know.

Jack.

Hi, Jack.

I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

What have you done?

You can't blame yourself for this.

Drones are unreliable.

Sometimes things go wrong.

Go wrong?

You killed her.

I know.

It's tragic.

She was a wonderful person.

Jack, we want to bring you here.

I've been authorized to tell you,
we're going to asign you a new mission.

You and the survivor.

There's a lot of interest up here.

Bring her up.

We can debrief and anything's possible!

It's time to go home, Jack.

Jack?

Jack...

Jack.

I'm sorry.

Hang on!

Lightning.

That's the plan.

We need cover!

There!

Are you okay?

No!

Don't worry, here we're staying out of there.

Are we gonna die?
No!

Maybe.

Jack!

Son of a bitch!

Wait here!

Who is he?

Hey!

Wait!

Wait!

Drop your weapon!

Easy.

It's okay!

Don't move!

You have to shut that drone down.

Stop moving!

Jack!

It's okay!

Julia!

Julia!

Don't touch me.

Hold on!

Just hold on!

Jack Harper.

Tech-52.

There you are.

What's happening?
Are you okay?

I thought when you came across
the border that I lost you.

False alarm.

I should get back out there to...

You come all the way home
and I don't get a kiss?

What's going on up there?

I was thinking...

Why don't you come down with me?

To the surface.

We can go right now.

Now?

Yeah.

Are you serious?

You won't believe what's down there.

Jack...

You know the regulations.

Yes.

Can we not do this again,
I'm done talking about it.

Okay.

This is gonna hurt.

Hell of a day, huh, Bob?

You always loved this song.

I'm not him.

I know I'm not...

But I've loved you...

For as long as I can remember.

I don't know how else to say it.

You know what you said to me once?

You said, when it was all over,
you'd build me a house on the lake.

We'd grow old and

fat together.

Then we would fight.

Maybe drink too much.

Real romantic.

And then we would die.

And be buried in the meadow by the lake.

And the world would forget about us.

But we would always have each other.

I remember.

Those memories are yours, Jack.

They are ours.

They are you.

Good morning.

I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.

You still can.

I have to go.

Those people need my help.

We'll come back when it's over.

Promise me.

We'll come back when it's over.

You had me worried for a second.

I thought you weren't coming back.

Well, I had to prove him wrong.

You look like shit.

You should see the other guy.

If I told you, what you'd find out there,
you'd have thought I was crazy.

I still do.

Malcolm Beech.
Julia Harper.

Come on...

Mission, I'm picking up a biotrack
somewhere near the west canyons,

can you confirm the sequence?

Stand by.

DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

Mission, 185 just went off grid.

Copy Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

I'd been in the army less than a year
when that unholy thing arrived.

Saw the moon get taken up.

Right up here in the night sky.

Couldn't believe it.

After that, nature took over.

There's bed rocks around Chicago, so we were
spared the worst of the waves... quakes.

Most people just starved.

And the Tet set crew ships down.

The door is opened...

And out you came.

Astronaut Jack Harper.

Thousands of you.

Memory wiped.

Programmed to kill.

They had taken one of our best...

turned him against us.

No soul.

No humanity.

The Tet...

what a brilliant machine.

Feeding off one planet after another for energy.

Phase two.

was drones repairmen.

50 years of watching those
Hydro Rigs suck our planet dry.

Then one day,

I saw you sat down.

another the drone to fix.

But in the rubble that day

was a book.

You picked it up.

You studied it.

And I...

thought I saw a way.

When you stepped in front of that
drone and saved here...

I knew.

You were in there, somewhere.

I just had to find a way to bring you back.

Watch it.

Give it some space.

Come on, you're making it nervous.

That is one pissed off weapon.

No, it's just a machine.

Oh, I would love to be there
to see that thing's face when this goes off.

That would be a one way trip.

Yeah...

But it'd be worth it.

Welcome back, commander.

Open the door!

Shit!
Spread out!

I'm okay.

The drone.

Send the drone.

It's going in.

I though we had it.

I really did.

I can take the bomb myself.

You know it will swat you like a fly.

Not if I go.

No.

She asked you to bring me up.

So bring me up.

We'll go together.

It reminds me of home.

Ready?

Jack.

Dream of us.

Flight recorder, play back for the Odyssey mission.

3-8, 2017.

Okay, Bob.

Ready for space.

Good morning, Odyssey,
from your friends here in mission control.

Morning, Mission!
This is commander Jack Harper.

Thank you for that fantastic wake up call.

Pre rendez-vous checks complete,

electrical guidance and nav systems are all good.

Range behind object 250 clicks.

Twelve below V bar closer rate 200 kilometers per hour.

Copy that.

It's good to see you, Jack.

After the very last days of sleep,
sounds like you're ready to go.

Oh, I'm ready to go.

Your next battle will bring you
up level and to speed

at 50 kilometer range where you'll hold.

Copy, we go 50 clicks from object
for sensor scanned evaluation.

Targets look good.

Initiating burn in 3...
2... 1... Ignition.

I see a good burn.

Are you reading any output from the object?

Negative, zero heat. No MR.

There's no sign of life.

How is the rest of the crew doing?

Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should join me shortly.

Rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.

Copy that.

You missed a hell of a game last night.

Well I tell you guys no spoilers
about last nights game.

I'm looking forward to watch it when i get back.

You're not talking about football already, are you?

Good morning, Vica.
Good morning, Sally.

How are you doing this lovely morning?

Another day in paradise.

For the history.

Tech-49.

I have you on approach.

Hello, Sally.

It's a busy morning, huh?

I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.

It's Julia Rosakova.

Female survivor from the crashed module.

Stay your intention.

Deliver the survivor

as requested.

We are

more effective team.

Proceed entering.

Mission, we got a situation.

The last burn was spot on to give us
a 50 click hold from object.

But radar range still decreasing.

We are accelerating toward the object.

We're gonna need full house burn to pull away.
Initiate now.

Enter target.

Set.
Target's good.

All forward engines.
Engines on.

Ready? Let's go!

Mission, we're on full house burn,
trying to back out.

There's a lot of vibration.

We're not getting away
from this thing.

Odyssey, telemetry shows structural over-stress.

Shut off the burn.
Do you copy?

Getting off burn.

Mission?

Sally?

Increased acceleration toward the object.

Estimating contact within two minutes.

I'm going to eject the sleep module.

It's programmed for insertion
into Earth orbital.

Now flight command module oughta
vibrate free.

I want you back there now.
Absolutely not.

That's an order.
Jack, no, we're team!

We gotta go, Jack!
30 seconds!

Dream of us.

Jack...

Tech-49, enter at headway speed.

Entering at headway.

Welcome back.

Don't go all shaky on me.

Jack, I can't help notice your respiration
and heart rate have increased.

I'm just exited to finally meat you, Sally.

There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.

Yeah.

I feel bad about that.

Your voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.

Tell me why you're here.
You have 5 seconds.

I want Julia to live.

And our species to survive.

This is the only way.

Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.

Welcome home, Jack.

Jack, you're doing the right thing.

I don't know what you are

or where you're from, but...

How about I tell about something I've read.

A story.

From Rome.

A city you destroyed.

It's a classic.

There was a guy...

Horatius.

He held the bridge alone against a whole army.

And what Horatius said was:

"How can a man die better..."

You don't have to die, Jack.

She doesn't have to die.

Everybody dies, Sally.

The thing is to die well.

Jack, that's not the survivor you've promised me.

No, it's not!

And what

Horatius said was:

"How can a man die better

Than facing fearful odds,

Drone! Get inside!
Get inside!

For the ashes of his fathers,

And the temples of his Gods?"

Fuck you, Sally!

<i>Earth</i>

<i>after the war.</i>

<i>3 years have passed since I saw your face.</i>

<i>I wonder if I come to you at night in dreams.</i>

<i>And the day</i>

<i>as memories.</i>

<i>Do I haunt your hours</i>

<i>the way you haunted mines?</i>

<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

<i>when you look at her.</i>

Mommy, look!

<i>If we have souls,</i>

<i>they're made of the love we share.</i>

<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

<i>Unbound by death.</i>

<i>For 3 years I searched for the house he built.</i>

<i>I knew it had to be up there.</i>

<i>Because I know him.</i>

<i>I am him.</i>

Who is that?

<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

<i>And I am home.</i>
