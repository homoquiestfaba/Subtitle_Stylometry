Now, count the money carefully

Otherwise, in and out

Let's go

Albert, you stay here with me

What?
-- Why? We don't go nowhere, eh?

Those Irish punks, they kiss our ass

I'm going to go crazy, just waiting

Go crazy.
-- Shit! .. Go!

Go on, what're you waiting for?

Close the door behind you,
cause it's freezing.

Don't see why I can't go

Game time, Frankie.
-- No shit, McCain.

Where is it going down, Terry?
-- Back room of Charlie's Pub.

Frankie you take the back.
-- Dylan, you're with me.

Hey, you talk to me when you get inside, huh?
--You got it, Frankie.

This is going to be fun

Hey, if something happens, Dylan,
you know I love you.

Fuck you, Terry.

Such a heart-breaker

#Oh, Danny boy..#

.. #The pipes, the pipes..#
-- What the hell you doing?.  ---.#. they call ..#

I'm singing..
-- Well, shut the fuck up, and go back inside.

Hey, I know you!  Johnny Flannigan,
.. St. Mary's ..

Yeah, I remember ..

You're that little asshole.
-- Yeah, that's me, all grown up.

Turn you ass around before I fuck you up

psss, you two must've been really tight

Is DiMarco afraid to deal
with us face-to-face?

Mr. DiMarco can't be bothered
fucking around with you potato-heads.

Well, he must be losing his mind
to trust you with $3 Million in cash.

Talk to me Frankie

Hey, yo, yo, freezing out here

Let's do this thing!

Stupid, fucken punk!

Hey!  Police!

You all right?

Yeah, where's Frankie?

Frankie!

Dylan!

Shit!

He fucked up my jacket, man.
-- I'll buy you a new one.

Don't you fucken move

Stay back!  Stay inside.

Get up!

You and me are gonna
have a little talk

One of DiMarco's guys got away

Get against the car

Get the car open. get the car open.

He's been in there an hour,
for God's sake.

Hey look, Sam
relax, huh?

Leave the man alone

Come on, Tony, quit dicking me around.
I know you work for DiMarco.

I know everything about that operation

I need to hear you say it

Ok, let's see what flying through
a window does to the human body.

broken ribs, broken nose,
multiple contussions ..

Sprained ankle, ah, sprained ankle ..

Fuck you, I know my rights

Let me tell you something ..

I've wasted the last three years
of my life on DiMarco.

I'm getting tired of watching him
walk in and out of courtrooms

in his $2 K dollar suits and silk ties

You start answering my questions or
I'm going to shove these broken ribs

right through
your fucking lungs

What?

I .. I .. couldn't hear that last part.

You weren't supposed to

oh, ok.

What's it going to be, Tony, huh?

What's it going to be Tony .. huh?

Huh?

DiMarco set up the whole thing

I was just doing what I was told.
-- Good, you hear that, Lucas?

Yeah.
-- You're going to swear to this in court, right?

Right?

Yea. Yes!

Good

That wasn' so bad, was it?

Where is McCain?

Hey, Captain.
-- Let's cut the shit, where is he?

ah, he's .. just .. ah ..
He's finishing up.

Hey, Captain

Got a confession

Oh, ah .. listen, when I was
asking him questions

he got a little upset
having to relive everything

Twisted his body
hurt himself a bit

check it out

What did you see?

I ..  I was looking down on.
ahm, ahm, I'm always looking down

What're you crippled? Move!

Sit.

Want some wine?

Did you eat?

Ok, what happened to the money?

It all happened so fast

Three fucking crazy cops
and those goddamn Irish punks

and everybody trying
to kill each other

Mr. DiMarco
I'm real sorry.

That would sound
a lot better on your knees

Vinnie

You know we're talking
about $3 Million in cash?

You realize that?

Mr. DiMarco, you know that
I would never steal from you.

Of course, of course.

Come here

Get him out of here

I want my money

Find me those cops

The court finds
that the statements

incriminating Mr DiMarco
are inadmissible as evidence

and cannot be used
in the criminal proceeding

brought by the state

These statements
were obtained

through the use of
E X C E S S I V E  FORCE

case dismissed

We'll get him next time, Terry, huh?
Let's get out of here.

I'm sick of your goddam antics

This hearing was a joke, sir.
-- Save it.

You're out of control, Terry

This isn't the first conviction we've lost

because of your short fuse

Now, personally
I could give a rat's ass

about how you treat
the DiMarcos of the world

But when you make me look bad,
we've got a problem.

You understand?

You gotta cool out, huh?

Terry

Terry

Hold on, Terry

Hey, listen to me

Fuck Devlin

Even though DiMarco walked,
we almost nailed him.

It's the third time he beats me,
Dylan, the third time.

Yeah, well, he beat me too, but you
don't see me getting crazy about it.

Look at him

E X C E S S I V E
FORCE

What the hell was that?

I thought you said
everything above the belt

I saw the opportunity.
I couldn't help myself.

You want to play, Frankie?

Come on. We'll play.

Let me help you up, Frankie

Get out of here

Dirty, but sweet

Misplaced Melancholies

mann, this filly be smiling at me.

Hey, homeboy, why don't you come
to the races with me on Saturday?

Huh? I mean you haven't done nothing ..

Since you and your lady
have called it

We ain't called nothing, Frankie.

Just needed some space, that's all.

Space

Homeboy, you need to get laid

Hey, how about it, man.
Why don't you, ah ..

Why don't you come out to
some clubs with me, tonight?

See what kind of women you can
attract hanging out with me

Oh yeah?

Oh, Frankie, you know
what I hate about Anna?

What?

She knows .. I ain't never going
to find another woman like her.

Damn, gotta do something
about your ties, Frankie.

You're a sick man, McCain.

I'm not the one doing
a jig in the middle of the night.

How are your hands?

They're alright

I'm telling you,
shake up your life..

Do something crazy with it
Play music for a living.

Are you saying what I do now
is not crazy enough?

Getting kind of old, ain't it?

Laying awake at night

worrying about a piece
of crap like DiMarco?

Yeah

..yeah, I suppose so, Jake.

Hey, ah, did Anna call by any chance?

I thought you said your birthday
didn't mean all that much to you.

Yeah, but it did to her.  Oh, well.

I'm going up to my room, Jake.

Look at this, Vin ..

A thousand dollar gate
with a $20 lock

<i>Lisa - who is she?
<font color="#D900D9">Susan Wood [born New Zealand]</font></i>

Are we still going out?

Yeah. Let's go wake up McCain
and show him

not everyone in the world
forgot his birthday

Hey, kitty

Just a second

This is a great song

How are you doing?

Do it

Get him out of here

Dylan?

What a waste

This is Dylan

If you can deal with that,
leave a message

Dylan, where the hell are you?

Are you dogging me
on my birthday?

you doing what
I think you're doing?

Always got you smiling, you sick ..
alright, call me.

Don, get my stick okay?
-- Yeah, Pop.

Okay, Detective Riley,
where's my money?

There was no money

only three guys left that room:
You, Frank Hawkins, and Terry McCain.

I'm telling you, it wasn't there

All I want is a little honesty, huh?

No .. listen.

I swear to God

I swear to God, I'm gonna get
my three million bucks back.

Where's my money?
-- I don't know!

Ok. The legs.

Can I do him?
-- Alright, come on.

Sit.

One or both?

Both

Guys ..

How can I fucken tell you,
when I don't fucken know!

Sit .. still

What fucking money?

I hate all you Irish pricks

Last chance, Detective.

Fuck you

ok, your mother's waiting up ..

You know how she gets

It's Lisa, Matt Dylan's girlfriend ...

Somebody popped her

old lady found her
about an hour ago

Saw the busted door,
-- Where's Dylan?

Nobody knows

Any ideas?

If I did, I wouldn't be standing here

Terry ..

That's his gun

He wouldn't go down and pick up
a newspaper without his gun

Maybe Dylan had made himself
some serious enemies

What does that mean?

come here, let me talk to you

Hey, Terry
Take it easy out there.

Word has it DiMarco lost
$3 million on your last bust

Bullshit ..
Bullshit on both accounts.

Which are exactly?

one of DiMarco's guys
got away from us that night

Now you know the fucker
had the good sense

.. to take the money with him.

Secondly .. Dylan, god ..

Dylan was
the cleanest man I knew.

"was"?

Dylan's dead

We both know it

DiMarco's been an obsession
of yours for years

I kept telling you ...

keep it in check ..

I just said keep it in check

Well, you become Chief in less than a week,
you don't have to deal with my ass anymore..

Chief or no Chief, I'm making this my priority ..

Let's just say DiMarco's guy
got the $3 million

and convinced DiMarco
he didn't have it

that means he thinks
one of us took it

What it means is he's gonna
be coming after you next, or Frankie.

You guys stick together. Understand?

Terry,

.. think, this was for you

What do you want me
to do with it?

Come here, little guy

These assholes
think they're funny, man

dumping the body in
the garbage like that

No!

Hey, man this is a private club.
-- This won't take long.

You fucking deaf here?

Who the hell are you?

Get out of my way

I'm looking for Vinnie DiMarco

Obviously he's not here

Where is he?

I don't know, man

I'm going to ask you all,
one at a time

Now, I'm not leaving here
until I get an answer

That's one.

What about you?
-- He said he was going out.

Where?
-- Metro.

That's where he hangs

You better hope he's still
hanging when I get there.

Get that son of a bitch

Get off of me

Come on, Vinnie

Regards to the old man

Have a nice night

How did you get in here?

I had a set made

Don't trust a cop

Oh, that's right, Yvonne ..

We're all dirty, scum-sucking pigs,

Out to make
your life miserable.

I think it's time for me to go.
-- Sorry.

I'll see you Friday
at the photo shoot

You don't just storm in here after
three months, like it's still your home.

What are you doing out running
at night?. It's a fucked up city.

I would have assumed by now
you would have cleaned it up.

You need two guns now?

That's right

One I shoot the fucker with

the other one takes on any
fuckers who are coming at me ..

while I put a few more shots
into the first fucker ..

to make sure he's dead.

You're drunk

I didn't expect it
to be a secret.

He wasn't living here
when I left.

Oh, shit. I forgot to feed it.

And it's a she

So you just break into my house,
get drunk, and feed your cat?

This does not constitute a break-in

Just .. just, take your cat and get out.

She was a present from Dylan
for my birthday

He's dead

They dumped his body
in a junkyard, for a joke.

Before they blew his head off,

they smashed his knees

His knees, for Christ's sake

Get me some napkins

Would you like a cookie?

It's just not good for him

Yeah, that's my point

You know what I'm saying?

You try to resist

Yeah

What was that about?

You

Norman thinks you're going
to blow away DiMarco

I told him I'd cover your ass
when you did it.

You now, man,
we had one thing going for us ..

Now, these punks, man. They'd think
twice about killing  a cop ..

because, they know it brings
down serious misery

that's gone to shit now

When a DiMarco feels that
the cops have ripped him off

it grows him a whole new set of guts

So I say to Devlin,

I says, you really going to come
after us if we kill this bastard?

What did he say?

Nothing

Nothing. Which to my mind,
he's giving it his silent blessing..

As pissed as he may be
to give it.

Hey, man.
Swing by my apartment, will you?

I've got to get out
of these clothes.

Why don't you, ah, grab us a
couple of beers, alright?

I've gotta get out of this,
we'll swing over your place ..

You want a sandwich or something?
-- Nah, we're drinking, not eating.

I'll be right down

Frankie!
Come on, let's go.

Yo! Frankie..

You're not going to like
what you see, Captain.

How you doing?

You know what, Devlin,
you and my are a lot alike,

What're you trying to say, McCaine?

There are plenty of times,
you've looked the other way. Plenty.

You're right
we are a lot alike

You do what you have to do

Terry?

Remember, none of this conversation happened

Okay, clean up this shit, ok.

Get some coffee

Hey, Tom.

Piece of shit

Where is he?

You look good
wrapped in garbage

Go get him

Don't you move

Let's not do anything
irrational here

Come on, I'm right here

What do you want?

What do I want?

I want to see the tough guy

I want to see the guy
who smashes knees

Shoots people in the face

Come on!  I want to see him!

I'm not gonna fight you

Get up

Get up!

Please ..

.. please.

Let's make sure it stops right here.
-- Shut up!

Don't  kill me

Die with a little dignity

You keep the money, okay?
.. keep the money.

Don't kill me

Jesus ..

You're pathetic

Thought we'd drop by for a visit

I don't have any milk
for the cat

She's fine.
How about you?

I heard about Frankie ..

What's happening, Terry?

You want to talk about it?

Kids grow up in this city ..

knowing things
are rigged, and fixed

It's just a given

I don't know,
I guess I grew up weird

I wasn't going
to accept that shit.

I went to kill DiMarco
last night.

And?

He wasn't home

Terry

What?

He was pathetic

So pathetic, I couldn't do it.

You bring your enemies
to their knees

They're not supposed to jump
down there on their own.

Let's get the hell
out of here

take a vacation
What do you say?

Just like that?

I haven't seen you
in three months

Now you want
to go away together?

Sure. Why not?
-- Ok.

It's gotta be somewhere pretty warm ..

and someplace
pretty expensive

like the Caribbean, St. Bart's or something..

Terry?

Excuse me

Oh, god

Somebody killed DiMarco

What?
Terry

Would you like a drink, Mr. Devlin?

Lime and soda

Sit down

You are out of
your fucking mind.

I called your office
three times.

You know I have the DA's office
sitting directly behind me.

I didn't kill DiMarco

can I get you a drink?

No

You ready to order now?

No, I'll call you

What do you mean, you didn't kill him,
I got two witnesses.

Same guys you kicked the
shit out of, remember?

I was there, but I didn't kill him

Don't fucken lie to me, Terry

I told you I'd protect you
Don't lie to me.

Have I ever lied to you?
Have I?

Look
I'm innocent.

Then we haven't got a problem

I need a couple
of days on my own

to find out what
the hell's going on

Get your ass out of here
before I have to arrest it.

Thank you

<i>A suspect has been named

Salvatore DiMarco</i>

<i>The suspect, Chicago Police
officer Terrance McCain,</i>

the Tactical Narcotics Unit</i>

$3 Million cocaine bust</i>

<i>on the south side</i>

McCain!
Get your butt down here.

<i>Terrance McCain has

<i>- to high fashion-model Anna Gilmour could not</i>
-- They're talking about you on the radio..

What?

You'e been named as
a suspect in DiMarco's murder

Terrance McCain

linked to the high-fashion model, Anna Gilmour,

Give me the phone

They're gonna get her killed

Come on, baby, pick up

It's her machine

Scaring the shit out of someone
is not the why to protect them.

Believe me, I'll never do it again.

You should be proud of me

I remembered everything
you taught me.

I don't remember
teaching you anything

about punching me in the mouth

Relax. My agent
is sending me photos.

Anna, wait a minute.
Get away from the door.

I won't open it
I'll just look.

It is the messenger guy

Hi, come in

You'll have to sign right here

At the bottom?

Terrance!

What is your jaw made of?

Who was he?

two-bit fucken gangster DiMarco hired

DiMarco's dead

His son.
He came after you to get at me.

I have to get you out of here
for a few days

You all right?

It's amazing

All that's been going on
and we end up back here.

We had some good times
in this house.

Sneaking down to hide
Christmas presents

making love under the tree

Yeah

Making love was the
only way we related, Terry.

Damn good why to relate

Yeah, a good bust over a good fuck any day, right?

I was being an asshole
when I said that.

Shame I didn't
know that at the time

It had gotten out of hand

I was thinking about you
all the time.

I was thinking about you
before I went in on a bust

So I made you feel less
like a tough guy?

It's the first thing
in my life ..

that I didn't have
the balls for.

Until now.

It's just you and me

Hello?
Hold on.

Phone for you

Yeah?

What the fuck you doing to me?
Huh?

I thought you were gonna
buy me some time.

DiMarco had friends
in the media.

His son knew who to call ..

This is Chicago, for Christ's sake.

Where are you?

Look, not on the phone..

Well, how the hell are
we going to talk, McCain?

Just tell me where to meet you

I don't know..

ahh, Christ ..

What about the ahh train repair shop
on Wilson.

the north end parking lot?

Yeah. What time?

10:00 O'clock,
I gotta go.

Something wrong, honey?

When isn't something wrong?

I gotta go back into the city
I'll be gone a couple of hours

that's all

Wait a minute,
come here.

I want you to feel something

ah, Terry,
-- I want you to feel it.

Terry, that boy can see us

I want you to take it out
.. slow.

.. Terry ..
-- Go on, do it.

Good girl

Now when I get home tonight,
I'm gonna teach you how to shoot it.

Damn

Shit

that way

Game time, buddy

Give it up

Fuck you

Oh, that's original

Who sent you?

There's enough juice in this
thing to move an entire train

Who sent you?

Yeah?

I heard

It was as much your idea
as it was mine,

Relax, I'll take care of it

All I need to do is find him

Really?

And nobody else knows
about this place?

Good .. good.

Yeah

About time
you paid your respects

Respects, Vinnie? no

Everybody's got something
crooked in their family tree.

Every Irishman who's a cop
had some uncle that's a hood

that did some favor
for some Italian.

What I'm telling you is ..

any business between
your father and me

was as a typical
part of this city

as the Cubs to Wrigley Field

That's enough, Tommy!

It's about an hour out

Hey, don't underestimate this guy

Like the three specialists did?

Three specialists
you brought in?

The ones they pulled
out of the train yard?

Just a small town
we're living in

The glory days are over, Vinnie

What's left of Little ltaly?

See what you did?
You know what's left?

One city block

Don't even dream alone at night
of fucking with me.

How's it going, Sam?

Terry, what do the hell're you doing?

Devlin's got every cop
in the city out after you

Shoot to kill, is that the order?

God!
you're bleeding.

Devlin set me up.
Why?

Did he kill DiMarco?
is that what it is?

Come on, Sam,
I'm asking as a friend.

All I know is DiMarco
and Devlin go way back ..

Back to when Devlin
was working the streets

He was on the take?

A lot of us were back then

But it was a long time ago

If he was still involved
with DiMarco ..

I swear to God, I don't know.

Of course he was, Sam

that's why he wanted
DiMarco dead

He was becoming
Chief of Police

He had to get the scum
off the bottom of his shoes.

I did everything he wanted me to
but pull the trigger.

And now, I'm the one loose end

You gotta go
over his head, Terry

You gotta find somebody
you can trust.

I trust nobody

I'm so sorry, sorry

Hold still

Let me do that

<i>Anna Gilmour - who is she?
<font color="#D900D9">Charlotte LEWIS (1967) [England]</font></i>

Thank you

It is time that the people
of this city stop accepting ..

that there will always be
corruption in Chicago

I don't accept it

And now that
I'm Chief of Police,

what I accept or don't accept
becomes the reality.

There have always been members
of this department ..

and, yes, if you look
in the news right now

there still are members
of this department

who create violence

It is true that the use
of  E X C E S S I V E   FORCE

has been tolerated

It has been tacitly condoned
and until now, undisciplined

To even begin to deal
with this problem

we have to get to the core

Wake up,
get up.

And the core of the problem
is fundamentally

a question of supervision,
management, and leadership

Shit. Where's the gun
I gave you?

Downstairs

Stay here

Terry

Don't stop

Get in. Hurry up

Don't move till I come get you,
you hear me?

Here. Take that.

What do you know?
You're a natural.

What? What? come on

Son of a bitch

Mario

What are you
fucking looking at?

Go find him

Hey, Nick

Nicky

It's all right come here

What about me standing here
in one piece

scares the shit
out of you, Jake?

What are you talking about?

I turn around, and out of nowhere
you're standing there in the dark.

Vinnie DiMarco and his boys

paid me a little visit
this morning out in the country.

only three people knew
about Anna's farmhouse

Dylan, Frankie ..

and you, Jake. Nobody else.

Not, not  Devlin .. nobody

That you could be even thinking
what you're thinking ..

Dylan and Frankie are dead

Aw, man

Tell me, Jake

You and Devlin got something going?
Is that what it is?

Fuck you

Tear the place up ..

Go on!

Only do yourself a favor, man
Don't bust up the piano..

cause then you won't have
anything to play your music on.

When you think you got
a problem with somebody

that's when you feel
like you're at your best

You know that game
You're an artist at it

that's what you've been
refining in yourself

Look where it's got you
This ain't your town..

or Devlin's
or Vinnie DiMarco's

There were people here
before you Irish and Italians

Now, if you're not gonna
bloody me up, McCain

then, please,
get the fuck out of my club

Hey,
you're late.

check-out time was 1:00 o'clock, huh?

Yeah, yeah, that's right

Misplaced Melancholies,
all right? To, ahh, to win.

Get the fuck out

I love you. Get the fuck out

Here's a birth certificate
for the newly born

passport, and I want my ticket

Now, this is very
interesting, you know

but I won't be working
for a living next time around

So, where's my fucking money?

The money's safely hidden,
Frankie

Don't sweat it,
but we got a problem

DiMarco's kid screwed up..

McCain is still out there

Now you got a problem
-- nah, ah

Yeah, yeah, you do

Now, you got a lot
of guys on the force

who'll do any shit
for you, man

You even got me a dead body
to blow up, huh?

Not now,

Not now that I'm police chief

You'll have to kill
your friend

You're dead

So it's not exactly gonna
screw up your life, is it?

I can't .. I can't go after McCain

Don't be so afraid of him,
Frankie

Listen, you'll have
the jump on him

It'll take him a few seconds to
realize he's not seeing a ghost

I'm not afraid of him, man
I'm not afraid of anybody

I just don't wipe out
my friends

Yeah, well, unfortunately,
McCain did the unexpected

and didn't blow
DiMarco's head off, did he?

I would have bet money
on him, man

I would have bet everything that
he would've taken out DiMarco

You did bet, and you lost,
you lost half of $3 Million.

Hey, don't fuck with me, Devlin

You can win it back

You know him
better than anybody

You'll find him easy

So, you take him out
and you take him out fast

Because if I go down,
you're gonna go down with me

Do the right thing

Misplaced Melancholies

Frankie

Hey, it's me
leave a message

Terry, I'm at Yvonne's loft

We're gonna go ahead with
the photo shoot tonight

I'm worried about you
call me soon as you can

I love you

Jake

Jake.
Hell, man ..

You know, I didn't think
anybody was here

It's good to see you, buddy

You know, I was supposed
to meet McCain

but I couldn't remember
the chick's address

You look pretty good
for a dead man, Frankie

Trust me, it's a long story

Give me that

We'll fill you in on it
later, all right?

Now the piece

Let's go downstairs

Sure .. sure.

Let's call the police, Frankie

Sit down

Shit .. shit!

Fuck!

Jake

Jake ..
Jesus.

Jake

oh, here come on
Hold it. Hold that

Give me your hand
Push on that

Don't move

This is Detective McCain

I need an ambulance
at the Deja Vu Jazz club

1125 Bleeker.
A man's been shot

Here, you,
keep this against it

Frankie

I know.  I know.

Listen, you gotta
hang in there, man

you're going to be alright

You gotta go

I'm not going anywhere
I'm staying right here

He's after Anna

Yeah, well, Anna ain't home
don't worry about it.

Yvonne

Go on .. go on.

Sam.
Hold on. Hold on.

Frankie Hawkins is alive

Relax. Don't exert yourself.

I'm telling you the truth
McCain went after him

He's gonna need some backup.
Now get your asses over there.

Get him outta here

Devlin

Yeah

What did he say?

He mentioned you, Raymond.

Where was he shot,
in the brain?

He's in shock

Go to the hospital
Keep him quiet

What do you mean?

I didn't mean put a bullet
in him, lieutenant

Seal the room off

make sure no one goes in
until he comes out of it

Yvonne, take a look
at the lighting?  Yvonne?

Terry, is everything ok?

I didn't know you were coming

Get everybody out right now

I want you to take
everybody out of here

Go out the back door
Just do it right now

ok

Yvonne, come on
Let's do what he says

Smile, Terry.

You're not gonna shoot me
in the back, Frankie

You don't know that

The grave changes a man

I'm betting
you're the same man

You won't shoot me
in the face, either

Don't gamble, all right?
now, that's my thing

You may not be so good at it

Drop the gun, Terry

Don't fuck with me
Man, drop the gun

Ok

Here it is,
ok?

Come on, partner

Drop the other one

Now, just take it easy,
Frankie

Take it easy?

You didn't kill DiMarco, man

Goddamn it,
you didn't kill him

So you did

What was I gonna do, man?

Sit around and wait for him to
do to me what he did to Dylan?

You took his money, Frankie

I tripped over it

I got knocked on my ass by
$3 Million in cold, hard cash

I figured, what the hell,
man, roll with it, alright

God ..

That was
so fucking stupid

You keep talking
like that, all right?

You make it easy, man

Think about all the blow you're gonna
have to buy with that money

Just to deal
with what happened to Dylan.

Think about that, Frankie

Don't say stuff like that, man

Where are you gonna aim,
Frankie?

Right between the eyes?

Fuck you, man

Get up .. get up.

ok, ok, that's enough, Terry

That's enough

Hey, Captain, look.

hey, man, it's over,
all right? It's over

Not likely

Captain

Captain

Hold it, Captain

Son of a bitch
He's up the fire escape

Take the stairs, Sam

You didn't think I'd run off without
saying goodbye, did you Terry?

You set me up

You fucked with me
You fucked with Frankie

Frankie came to me
with the money

Who the fuck do you think
you're dealing with?

You sleep?

of course, he's asleep.

Hey, you asleep?

I'm not sleep

anymore

I knew it

Hey, look who wanted
to come see you

Hey, there.

You missed me?

She sure did

Is it broken?

Yeah

Good

What do you mean, good?

I thought you wanted me
to play music for a living

Your left hand sucks.
It could use the practice.

oh, yeah?

Thanks a lot

What happened
to the $3 Million?

They didn't say anything
about it in the paper.
