New York, it's "late night with
Seth meyers."

Tonight -- Jennifer garner,

msnbc host and journalist
Stephanie ruhle,

music from bebe rexha,
featuring the 8g band with

Allison Miller and Pearl.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

[ Cheers and applause ]
Ladies and gentlemen,

Seth meyers.
Seth: Good evening.

I'm Seth meyers.
How is everybody doing tonight?

[ Cheers and applause ]
That is great to hear.

In that case, let's get to the
news.

After the "New York times"
published an op-ed anonymously

written by a senior white house
official yesterday criticizing

President Trump, trump tweeted,
quote, "treason, question Mark."

Even weirder, Mike pence tweeted
back, "sure, let's do it."

[ Laughter ]
A spokesman for housing

secretary Ben Carson said today
that Carson did not write the

anonymous "New York times" op-ed
by senior white house official.

Hey, don't worry, literally no
one thought it was you.

[ Laughter ]
We didn't even know you were

awake.
[ Laughter ]

According to
"the Washington post," after

"the New York times" published
an op-ed anonymously written by

a senior white house official,
President Trump told a friend

that he could only trust his
children because they don't know

how to write.
[ Laughter ]

"Well, I know it wan't either of
you two bozos."

[ Laughter ]
Former white house press

secretary Sean spicer said in an
interview today that he believes

many trump administration
officials are burnt out.

While the president himself just
looks burnt.

[ Laughter ]
President --

[ cheers and applause ]
President Trump today thanked a

north Korean leader Kim jong-un
for saying he had, quote,

"unwavering faith in president
trump," which is only going to

make it harder when trump sees
Kim's "New York times" op-ed.

[ Laughter ]
A pilot flying over a

Cape Cod beach today spotted
eight great white sharks in the

water.
Unfortunately he didn't spot the

one that was right behind him.
[ Laughter ]

Just so you know, that's by far
my favorite of all these.

[ Laughter ]
A Japanese hotel now has a

robotic motion detecting
dinosaurs that check guests in

at reception.
Or, if you want to see robotic

dinosaurs here in America, watch
Brett kavanaugh's confirmation

hearing.
[ Laughter ]

[ Cheers and applause ]
A company has developed

$1,500 mirror that has an
embedded video screen that can

live stream fitness classes into
people's homes.

And then three months after you
buy it, you can hang your

clothes on it.
[ Laughter ]

Researchers in Croatia believe
they have discovered the world's

oldest cheese which dates back
7,000 years.

They found it at little caesars.
[ Laughter ]

According to new research, more
than one in four people have

deleted the Facebook app from
their phones, while others

deleted it, then re-downloaded
it, checked it, got into a

fight, and then deleted it
again.

[ Laughter ]
And finally the NFL's

green bay packers have added
several new concession items to

their menu for the new season.
Including a bratwurst covered in

a blanket of fried cheese curds
stuffed in a pretzel bun.

Man, pretty soon nobody's gonna
be able to stand for the anthem.

[ Laughter ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
fantastic show for you tonight.

Her new movie "peppermint" is in
theaters this weekend.

Jennifer garner is here tonight.
[ Cheers and applause ]

So happy to have her back on the
show.

She's the host of "msnbc live
with Stephanie ruhle,"

stephani ruhle joins us.
[ Cheers and applause ]

Very excited about that.
And we have an amazing

performance you won't want to
miss from bebe rexha back on the

show, as well.
[ Cheers and applause ]

So you're here on a good night.
Before we get to any of that,

the white house has been rocked
yet again by an anonymous

warnings about the president's
fitness for office, and yet

Republicans are still moving
forward with his supreme court

pick.

For more on this, it's time for

"a closer look."

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
[ Cheers and applause ]

Seth: Trump is being allowed
to fill a lifetime seat to the

nation's highest court despite
constant leaks about how

dangerous and erratic he is.
Every day new details emerge

from famed journalist
Bob woodward's upcoming book

"fear," whose cover looks like a
lifetime movie poster about an

evil stepfather.
[ Laughter ]

And those details confirm that
trump is as vulgar and petulant

in private as he is in public.
In the book, even his own aides

describe trump as an unhinged
idiot and professional liar who

acted like, and had the
understanding of a fifth or

sixth grader.
[ Laughter ]

Of course, you don't need a book
to know that.

[ Laughter ]
You just need eyeballs and ear

holes.
[ Laughter ]

Trump is in private exactly who
he seems to be in public.

It's both shocking and not
surprising at the same time.

I mean, the guy literally
misspelled his own wife's name

in a tweet.
[ Laughter ]

Not like he's doing that in
public and then in private

besting world leaders in games
of chess.

[ Laughter ]
"Bad news, Angela, it seems you

failed to counter act my queen's
gambit by taking my pawn.

And now my knight has your king
in check.

[ Light laughter ]
So if you'll excuse me I have to

meet my wife, melanoma."
[ Laughter and applause ]

Now one of the most eye-catching
allegations in the book is that

trump's closest aides have

resorted hiding documents from

him to stop him from signing or

reading them.

Woodward described an
administrative coup d'etat and

the nervous breakdown of the
executive branch with senior

aides conspiring to pluck
official papers from the

president's desk so he couldn't
see or even sign them.

Woodward also details the
actions of some top aides in the

white house including former
economic adviser Goldman sachs's

veteran Gary cohn.
Quote, according to woodward,

cohn stole a letter off trump's
desk that the president was

intending to go sign to formally
withdraw the U.S. from a trade

agreement with South Korea.
Porter consulted cohn,

Gary cohn, who told him,
according to woodward, quote, "I

can stop this, I'll just take
the paper off his desk."

Seth: The craziest thing
about that story is that if you

steal a piece of paper from
trump's desk, he won't even know

it's gone.
[ Laughter ]

He's like who's blown away by
the first half of a magic trick.

"Oh, my god, how did you get
that lady inside the box?"

[ Laughter ]
This isn't even first time

there's been an explosive
allegation from a tell all book

about how the trump white house
deals with paper.

You might remember that just a
few weeks ago former trump aide

omarosa manigault-Newman wrote
in her book that she once saw

trump eat paper in
the oval office.

[ Laughter ]
Now in fairness maybe he was

just eating it so Gary cohn
couldn't steal it first.

[ Laughter ]
Gary comes in late at night

looking for it and then trump
flips on a light and says, "oh,

are you looking for your paper,
Gary?

[ Laughter ]
Because I'm afraid I put it

somewhere safe in my belly.
[ Laughter ]

Now if you'll excuse me, I have
to meet my wife, majorca?"

[ Laughter ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

But the book --
but the book is also filled with

stories from trump aides who
have loyally served him and

agree with most of his agenda.
Trying to cast themselves as

heroic saviors protecting the
public from the whims of a

madman.
For example, cohn threatened to

resign after trump's comments on
charlottesville.

But trump persuaded his economic
advisor to stay on.

Chief of staff John Kelly then
confided to cohn that he shared

cohn's horror, trump's handling
of the tragedy and shared cohn's

fury with trump.
Kelly told cohn, "I would have

taken that resignation letter
and shoved it up his ass six

different times."
[ Light laughter ]

Man, I would have loved to see
that conversation.

"I'm going to shove this
resignation letter up your ass."

"Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm going to shove it in

my mouth and it'll end up in the
same place.

[ Laughter ]
Second, it's easy to talk tough

but unless you're actually
willing to resign and tell the

American people everything you
know, then your tough talk is

worthless.
John Kelly is like a kid who

tells his friends he's going to
stand up to the bully who steals

his lunch money and then when
lunchtime comes, tells the

bully, "keep shaking there's
more in my back pocket."

[ Laughter ]
Now trump has denied all of this

and yesterday in the oval office
he called woodward's book a work

of fiction, but that's not what
he told woodward on the phone

when he called him just a few
weeks ago to complain that he

hadn't been interviewed for the

book.

Woodward recorded the call and

trump was very complimentary.

I spent a lot of time on this,

talked to lots of people --
all right, good.

And as you know and are
living, we are at a pivot point

in history.
Right.

And I would have liked to
have done that and I maximized

my effort.
Right.

And somehow it didn't get to
you or --

it's really too bad because
nobody told me about it, and I

would have loved to have spoken
to you.

You know I'm very open to you.
I think you've always been fair.

Seth: Oh, my god.
How is there always a secret

tape that contradicts everything
trump says?

[ Laughter ]
Although I guess I shouldn't be

surprised the same guy who can
be tricked into not signing a

piece of paper doesn't realize
everyone around him has a gopro

strapped to their heads.
[ Laughter ]

But, hey, in fairness to trump,

he probably didn't know he was

being recorded.

I'm turning on -- >> good.

My tape recorder --
oh, that's okay.

With your permission.
[ Light laughter ]

That's okay.
Seth: Oh, my god.

[ Laughter ]
He's like a --

[ cheers and applause ]
He's like bank robber who waves

at the security camera.
[ Laughter ]

The craziest part of this phone
call is when trump explains that

his aides never asked him if he

wanted to do an interview with

woodward because they were too

afraid.

It's a chance missed, and I do

not know how things work over
there in terms --

very well.
Of getting to you.

[ Laughter ]
Well, if you would call

Madeleine in my office.
Did you speak to Madeleine?

No, I didn't but I --
Madeleine is the key.

She's the secret because
she's --

well, I talk to raj about it.
She's the person.

I talked to kellyanne.
A lot of them are afraid to

come and talk, but you never
called for me.

It would have been nice, Bob, if
you called for me in my office.

I mean, I have a secretary.
I have two, three secretaries.

If you would have called
directly, a lot of people are

afraid.
Seth: So to recap, trump says

Bob woodward's book is a work of
fiction because he never spoke

to woodward because his aides
were too afraid to talk to him

about doing an interview for
woodward's book which is

literally called "fear."
[ Laughter and applause ]

Trump is such a bad liar, even
his lies prove that he's lying.

[ Light laughter ]
"Your book called 'fear' is

totally inaccurate and I would
have told you that if my aides

weren't too afraid to come talk
to me.

[ Laughter ]
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have

to meet my wife, mesothelioma."
[ Laughter and applause ]

For almost two year's we've had
this frustrating spectacle,

trump's closest aides
anonymously warning us that the

president they work for is
erratic and dangerous but

refusing to actually do anything
about it.

And yesterday we got the most
stunning example of that yet

from an anonymous op-ed in
"the New York times" titled, "I

am part of the resistance inside
the trump administration,"

warning about trump's behavior.
And now the op-ed has put trump

supporters in the weird position
of having to defend the

president's mental health.

Like south Carolina senator

Lindsey Graham who said this

Wednesday on CNN.

To those who believe that this

man is a fool, that this man is
crazy, that there's something

wrong with Donald Trump and it's
just the people around him that

keep us safe, you don't know
what you're talking about.

Seth: Yeah, if you're out
there saying he's a kook or he's

crazy or he's unfit for office,

you don't know what you're

talking about.

I think he's a kook.
[ Laughter ]

I think he's crazy.
I think he's unfit for office.

Seth: Oh, my god, the author
of the op-ed was Lindsey Graham!

[ Laughter ]
That would explain the paragraph

where he calls trump crazier
than a wet mule eating corn

through a picket fence.
[ Laughter ]

But this week has been a perfect
distillation of the gop's

complicity of the trump debacle
because even as a parade of

trump officials quietly warn the
public that he's unfit for

office, they're letting him hang
around to fill a lifetime seat

in the supreme court with his
hand-picked nominee

Brett kavanaugh.
And in his confirmation hearing

so far kavanaugh has been
exactly the kind of loyal

partisan trump would want.
For example, he's been asked a

series of questions that could
be crucial to the Russia

investigation, like can the
president pardon himself, does

he have to comply with a
subpoena?

And every time he has refused to

answer even those basic

questions.

President Trump claims he has
an absolute right to pardon

himself.
Does he?

The question of self-pardon
is something I've never

analyzed.
Can a sitting president be

required to respond to a
subpoena?

So that's a hypothetical
question.

Seth: No, it's not.
The president's lawyer

Rudy giuliani is on TV every day
talking about how trump would

just ignore a subpoena.
You know, this guy, always

looked like he just had a
resignation letter shoved up his

ass.
[ Laughter ]

I mean it's mind-boggling that
we're even considering allowing

the president to fill a lifetime
seat on the supreme court while

his own aids warn the public
that he's unfit for office.

But that's corrupt bargain the
gop has made.

They're not heroes containing

trump, they're collaborators

working with him even though

they know he's --

a kook.

[ Light laughter ]

Seth: This has been

"a closer look."

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
[ Cheers and applause ]

Seth: We'll be right back
with Jennifer garner, everybody.

[ Cheers and applause ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ª I don't give a damn
'bout my reputation

you're living in the past
it's a new generation â™ª

â™ª a girl can do
what she wants to do

that's what I'm â™ª
â™ª going to do

and I don't give damn
'bout my bad reputation â™ª

Seth: Give it up for the 8g
band right over there.

Also this week, our drummer is
from right here in New York

city.
She's one of our favorites.

We're always happy to have her
back.

The new album from her band
science fair is available

September 21st.
Give it up for Allison Miller,

everybody.
[ Cheers and applause ]

Also sitting in with us this
week, it's a been an absolute

delight to have her.
She's an amazing vocalist whose

her new album "heartbreak and
canyon revelry" is available

now.
And everyone in the audience is

receiving a three-song sampler
download card tonight.

Pearl is here, everybody.
Give it up for Pearl.

[ Cheers and applause ]
Thank you both.

Our first guest tonight is a
golden globe winning and

Emmy-nominated actress you know
from "alias" and such films as

"13 going on 30," and "Dallas
buyers club."

She stars in the action-packed

film "peppermint" which is in

theaters tomorrow.

Let's take a look.

Hurts doesn't it?
Knowing that it's all over and

there's nothing you can do about
it.

You didn't serve justice, your
honor.

I will.

Seth: Please welcome back to

the show our friend,

Jennifer garner, everyone.

[ Cheers and applause ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Seth: How are you?
[ Cheers and applause ]

Great.
Seth: Happy to have you here.

So happy to be here.
Seth: That's why -- I have to

say, that's why it's so helpful
to have a clip from a movie.

Because I think if you heard
there was a film called

"peppermint," you wouldn't
naturally --

right?
Seth: Think it would be a

scene like that.
Right, you think --

Seth: Yeah.
No.

Seth: Yes, this is --
not that.

Seth: A very -- and I do want
to talk about the film.

But first, I want
congratulate -- you got a star

on the Hollywood walk of fame.
Congratulations.

[ Cheers and applause ]
Yes, I did.

Do you stand it?
I kind of can't believe it.

I saw, you know, Burt Reynolds
today.

Seth: Yes.
Wonderful --

Seth: Rest in peace.
Yeah.

Rest in peace.
And I saw him.

And I thought, "oh, my gosh.
I have a star like he does."

Seth: Yeah.
I mean that's like -- it's

still there.
It's still there right now while

we're talking.
Seth: It's -- yeah.

That's not just like --
unless they've jackhammered

it out.
Seth: I think your safe.

They do that now.
Seth: They do every now and

then jackhammer one out.
You know.

Seth: But I think you're in
the safe zone.

We'll see today.
Seth: Whole family come?

Did a lot --
the whole family came.

Seth: That's really great.
There were a lot of us.

Oh, my gosh.
Seth: That's a beautiful

photo.
Look how proud everybody looks.

Oh, yeah.
My sister, Melissa, my sister,

susannah, my nieces and nephews,
brothers-in-law.

Seth: That's great.
And then --

kids, parents, mom and dad.
Seth: And then you had

Steve carell, Bryan cranston --
I know.

Seth: -- Judy greer, all
came to make speeches.

That was so meaningful.
The kind of weird mix of my

family who are never at
Hollywood things and then three

of my dear friends speak about
me.

It was just -- it was really
cool.

Seth: It's really cool.
It's such an amazing thing while

also just being on the street.
Yes, exactly.

[ Laughter ]
Seth: Yeah.

With gum on it.
Seth: Yeah.

Anyway, do you have one?
Seth: I don't.

Oh, shoot.
[ Laughter ]

Seth: You know, that's one of
things --

oh, that's awkward.
Seth: I'm glad we brought it

up, though.
I am too.

Seth: And again --
I am too.

Seth: You know what?
I do.

Seth: I'm so happy for you.
I don't even need one.

[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

That's my star?
You're my star.

So, obviously, this is a -- you
are a vengeful mother in this

film.
Yes.

Seth: You're -- some bad
things have happened to your

family.
And you're taking it out on the

people.
So angry.

I'm so angry in this movie.
Seth: Is -- was it -- is it

cathartic?
Is it cathartic to have mom

rage?
Deeply cathartic.

Seth: Yeah.
Yes, it is.

It is deeply cathartic to punch
things and to use, you know,

learn to use weapons correctly
and for pretend and not for

real.
Seth: Yeah.

But it is.
It's like -- there's something

about making this movie that
plays out every bit of mom rage

you've ever had on the
playground or every bit of mom

rage you've had like when your
child is put in the back of the

class and like a -- and you feel
like they should be in the

front.
Seth: Yeah.

Or their feelings are hurt.
Seth: I'm glad you never

actually reacted the way you
reacted in this movie.

Right.
Seth: That would be a real --

if any of this stuff was on the
playground, that would be a real

tmz moment.
Yeah.

I'd be wearing something else.

Seth: Yeah, exactly.
Yes, yeah.

Seth: It's the same director
as the film "taken."

Yes.
Seth: It's just --

Pierre morel.
Seth: Yeah, Pierre morel.

Were you drawn to the idea of
doing --

for sure.
I definitely wanted to work with

Pierre.
Because he understands what I

believe so firmly which is that
an action movie is just a drama.

And it's a drama that goes
really far and really off the

chains.
And -- but you have to have the

drama there in order to buy the
rest of it.

Seth: And -- you know,
obviously, the through line of

both of "taken" and this film is
like also parents and family --

right, yes.
Seth: Of what people are

willing to do which I think
anybody can watching those can

associate with the character
immediately when they know

that's -- it's not just a crazy
action movie where people are

doing these things for no
reason.

They actually have a core.
No, it's definitely grounded

in something.
This woman is fighting for kind

of just vengeance for her family
and for justice for something

that happened to them and the
corruption, the broken system

that led to them just being gone
with no reason and no recourse

for anyone.
And she goes off the rails a

little bit.
And it is a fantasy.

It is not a how-to video.
[ Laughter ]

But it is -- it's just
satisfying.

It's just like when the critics
showed up and said that they had

cheered in the movie theater.
And I know they're going to

write -- you know, I don't know
what kind of reviews they'll

write.
But I can imagine.

But I know that they had -- they
had that feeling of, like,

"yeah, get him."
You know?

Seth: It's also -- I feel
like it's been a long time since

the "alias" days -- >> yes.

Seth: Which is surprising.
Because, and I mean this

genially, you look the same.
So you kind look back and go,

"oh, 'alias' was a long time
ago."

Come on.
Yeah, it was.

Seth: Did you have to -- was
it fun to return to sort of your

action roots?
It was.

It had been such a long time
since I had done any action.

I mean, the last thing I did
that was action was "the

kingdom."
and my daughter learned to

crawl.
And she's 12.

So that was a long time ago, you
know?

[ Laughter ]
That's how you kind of --

Seth: Unless she was a really
late crawler.

[ Laughter ]
And yet, she was an amazing

crawler.
And don't cry, too.

Seth: Oh, "peppermint,"
"peppermint," "peppermint."

This is what's happening
right now.

But, anyway, yeah, the funny
thing was that when I actually

started shooting, there would be
things where I would do a take.

And I would say to the director,
"I'm so sorry.

I need to do that again."
I did that as Sidney.

Seth: Oh, really?
Yes.

Seth: Wow.
Which is the character I

played in "alias."
Seth: Yes.

And -- because she is like, I
mean, the way I would walk up

the stairs, I did it so many
times over five years.

I would like, take a couple
steps, and then look back at the

camera and then forward again.
And I was like, "hold on a

second.
Hold up.

That was -- that was -- it's on
abc right now.

Got to do it again.
I'm sorry.

Seth: And did you find -- was
your recovery the same as your

"alias" days?
No.

Seth: Yeah.
No, nothing is the same.

I mean I just -- I got in a
fight.

And this guy had a huge rifle.
And he twisted my hand.

And I was -- it swelled up.
And the crew members are like,

"what happened to your hand?"
And I was like, "oh, don't worry

about it.
We've got to keep fighting.

We've got to make our day."
And then, the next day, they

were like, "your hand doesn't
look good."

And so they brought an X-ray
machine to a trailer.

[ Laughter ]
'Cause they didn't want to want

to stop shooting.
And while they were turning the

camera around, they said, "go
put your hand in this X-ray

machine."
and the guy's like, "it looks

fine."
[ Laughter ]

And then months later, it's
still like this big.

And a doctor is like, "yeah,
that's a fracture."

Seth: Oh, wow.
I was like -- but I mean --

Seth: They brought in a prop
X-ray machine.

I survived, right.
[ Laughter ]

I'm okay.
But yes, the recovery issues are

real at 46.
Seth: Yes.

It's whiplash, a lot of
whiplash.

Seth: I -- you know,
fortunately your real children,

unlike your cinema children, are
fine.

Thank goodness.
Thank god.

Seth: And you post some
things on Instagram.

How old is you're son?
He's six and a half.

Seth: Okay.
So he sometimes will leave you

art projects.
Sure.

Seth: Like -- very gifted.
Okay.

Seth: Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

This is something.
This a wonderful drawing he did

in your calendar.
F-a-r-t.

Look at his spelling.
Seth: That's incredible.

Look at his penmanship.
Seth: Yeah, no, that's what

everybody is impressed with.
I mean it's block letter.

You like it, right?
Seth: And I don't want to

make it a contest, but this is
really amazing, your daughter.

She's older.
Yeah.

Seth: So let's give her a
break -- you know, give your son

a break here.
But she made you a 12-foot --

oh, my gosh.
Seth: She made you a

12-foot -- >> yes.

Seth: Long scarf --
yes.

Seth: As a birthday present.
She just started fourth

grade.
Seth: And that -- I was

thinking, "what does a 12-foot
long scarf look like?"

And it's a lot of scarf.
[ Laughter ]

It's mostly scarf, yeah.
It is.

Look, she gave it to me.
We do birthdays in the morning

at our house for some reason.
And she gave it in the morning

of my birthday.
We're about to leave for school.

And I said, "I can't wait to
wear this."

And she said, "it's chilly
outside today, mama."

And she was like, "you can wear
it."

And I was like, "yes, I can."
[ Laughter ]

I can.
I can.

And I will.
I look forward to that.

Seth: It's like one of those
nature videos where a boa

constrictor is eating an
antelope.

[ Laughter ]
It does.

Seth: Congratulations on both
of your kids and the film.

And it's always so great to see
you.

Thanks so much for coming by.
So good to see you too.

[ Cheers and applause ]
Seth: Jennifer garner,

everybody.
"Peppermint" in theaters

tomorrow.
We'll be right back with

Stephanie ruhle.
[ Cheers and applause ]

"msnbc live with

Stephanie ruhle" and "velshi and
ruhle" weekday mornings on

msnbc.

Please welcome to the show

Stephanie ruhle, everybody.

[ Cheers and applause ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
nice to be here.

Seth: Welcome.
I'm so happy you're here.

Now, you work in the building?
I do work in the building.

Seth: You have a studio but
you do not have a studio

audience?
No, I don't, but this

morning, I came in and I see the
amazing line because everyone's

here to come see your show and I
decided to give like a, "hey,

you know, anybody from Jersey?"
I'm like waving, I'm smiling --

not one person talks to me.
So I want to say sorry because

you all must me totally
disappointed.

I saw you six hours ago and
you're all like, and now I'm the

guest.
Seth: No.

No, this is a picture.
You took this picture.

These people are obviously very
excited to see you.

No, not one.
Not one.

Not a single one.
[ Light laughter ]

Seth: Well surely, this guy
was excited to see you.

Yes.
Nope.

Seth: Really, all right.
Not even remotely.

It's like my kids, I'm like,
"hey, guys, I'm going on

Seth meyers, do you want to
come?"

And they're like, "to talk
news?"

"No."
[ Light laughter ]

And my husband is like, "who
else is going to be there?"

And I said, "Jennifer garner,"
and they're like, "what,

electra?"
13 going on 30?

Yes.
And I was like, "forget it now."

Seth: And now, you're not
invited.

No, no.
Seth: We have shown clips

from your show before.
There's a personal favorite we

have.
A lot of times, you have people

on your show, people who are
defending the trump

administration, and sometimes
they're a little fast and loose

with the facts.
You always seem very quick with

a factual rebuttal.

And here's an example of that

that we enjoy.

Are we turning around 4% gdp?
When was the last time you heard

4% gdp growth?
Five times during the Obama

administration.
[ Cheers and applause ]

Seth: So, I mean, certainly
to some degree, you are aware of

some talking points that they're
going to come, and was that one

where you just couldn't believe
how happy you were to hear

something that could so quickly
be rebutted?

Well, the thing that's
amazing, these are major

business guys, and they think,
"oh, it's close enough, I'll

just say it," and the president
loves to say such negative

coverage, "everyone is out to
get me," but we're living in a

house of unforced errors.
The president is approaching

having told 5,000 lies.
Seth: Yeah.

That makes him --
Seth: The most ever, he's

very happy to tell you.
[ Light laughter ]

There you go.
That clearly makes him a

habitual liar.
So fact checking him every day

doesn't mean it's negative
coverage.

The economy -- I mean, that guy
knows the economy.

What President Obama didn't do
was sell the economy well.

President Trump is a fantastic
salesman, but like a used car

salesman, he's not telling the
truth and it is our job to fact

check him.
So we do.

Seth: When someone like that
comes on, and this happens a

lot, do you think, you know, a
trump-supporting ceo like that,

do you think he actually
believes what he's telling you

or does he just think he's going
to be able to slide it by?

Because, certainly, you would
think he would know that it

happened five times under the
Obama administration.

Without a doubt, but I think
they think, "oh, it's close

enough, and in the world of
President Trump, things are

close enough."
Because one thing he has done is

give people confidence, consumer
confidence is up, business

confidence is up, because he
gets people excited.

The problem is there aren't the
facts to back it up and they

don't think anyone is actually
going to check.

And in this short-term
environment, people don't.

President Trump makes people
feel good.

When they watched him on TV, on
"the apprentice," it was

primetime.
They were sitting in their house

on their couch and he's, "I'm
this business guy, I'm this real

estate guy, I don't take
anything from anyone."

People built a relationship and
they trusted that.

Seth: You were in business
for a long time before you were

in television.
What is your take, you know,

coming from the world of
finance, is this idea of trump

is a great businessman, is it a
mirage or is there something to

the idea that he was good at
this other thing before he was

president?
Well, if you were to compare

him to mitt romney, when
mitt romney ran, all of his

peers in private equity backed
him.

When President Trump ran, you
didn't see anyone from the big

real estate universe.
You didn't see any big New York

business people back him.
You saw people in middle America

who wanted a change.
And the thing is he did a

brilliant thing in that he went
to see them.

Those rallies were in places
where I haven't visited.

I don't know if you visited.
And it gave people hope.

The twisted thing is he gave
them hope without an actual

resolution.
He had the smarts to say I'm

going to solve income and
inequality, but he's not doing

it.
When he says, "I'm going to go

after trade," that's a good
idea.

There are issues.
China?

Yeah, there's problems there,
but what he's actually doing

makes no sense.
And he said, "intellectual

property or artificial
intelligence, we're going to go

after that."
President Trump, if you asked

him about ai, no joke, he would
think it was a steak sauce.

Seth: Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

So what he's offering the
American people --

[ cheers and applause ]
He's a brilliant marketer with

no real solutions, and the
country needs solutions.

Seth: You know, he falls back
on the economy every time it

seems like he's cornered.
Is there anything missing

because like you said, consumer
confidence is up, you know,

business confidence is up.
Is there an argument to be made

that he's making a fair point
when he says, "hey, despite

everything and despite how it's
a circus at the white house, the

economy is good," or is there
something that he's leaving out

there?
Well, there's something to

remember.
The economy was good before

President Trump took office.
It was a slow and steady climb

out of the financial crisis.
What Obama didn't do was sell it

very well.
He's a -- somewhat of a, not a

soft spoken guy, but certainly
more humble than trump.

Everyone is.
Seth: Yeah.

[ Light laughter ]
And when trump says things

are great and it's trickling
down, it's not.

We have lots of people with
jobs, and that's great, but they

just don't pay enough money.
And so this idea that things are

going to trickle-down, if you
look at Republicans that running

for office now in the midterms,
they don't talk about the

economy because they know in
their states people aren't

living comfortably.
It's those who don't need to run

again.
They're saying, "look at this

economy, it's great."
It's great for big business.

Right after trump won, I don't
know if you remember, he snuck

out of trump tower and he went
to the 21 club, right?

One of the fanciest restaurants
in New York.

Lots of people love it.
Filled with wealthy people, and

he said, "I'm going to lower
your taxes."

And he did.
So President Trump wanted to

impress and do this for the
wealthiest people and he has

done that.
The concern is that people who

voted for change aren't going to
get that change.

Seth: I showed one of your
greatest hits, and again, I'm a

fan of your work, but I do -- I
think it's only fair to show

what really one of the flubs of
the year.

I have to tell you, I loved it.
We were really happy when you

did it.
I'm glad you were.

My kids were too.
My kids were.

Seth: This I will say, if
your mom was on TV and you were

a kid, you'd be very happy about
this.

So here you are not as sharp as

you were earlier.

Let's take a look.

As California is farting,
excuse me, fighting, the largest

wildfire in the state's history.
[ Laughter ]

They're farting.
Well, there are a lot of

vegans in California.
Seth: That's true.

[ Laughter ]
There are a lot of cleanses

that go on.
So they could be farting.

Seth: No, right.
They're farting the wild fires.

They could be farting.
Listen, I did not get into

television until I was 36.
Seth: Yeah.

So if you wanted a TV
presenter who is a teleprompter

super star with perfect posture
and all of those things, then

you picked the wrong girl.
Seth: No, I want, you know,

once a year someone who actually
says farting.

[ Light laughter ]
You know what, we're going to

be keep it real and you know,
farting happens.

Seth: It does happen.
Thank you so much for being

here.
It's such a pleasure to meet

you.
Thank you.

Seth: Really appreciate it.
Stephanie ruhle, everybody.

"Msnbc live with
Stephanie ruhle" airs weekdays

at 9:00 A.M. and "velshi and
ruhle" airs weekdays at

11:00 A.M. on msnbc.
We'll be right back with more

"late night."
[ Cheers and applause ]

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
Seth: Welcome back,

everybody.
Sorry to do this, but if I may,

there's something that's been
bothering me that I need to get

off my chest.
I'm in the elevator earlier

today, just me and this one
other guy.

And when he gets off at his
floor, he turns to me and he

says, "have a good one," and I'm
like, "have a good what?"

And he says, "huh."
And I say, "you said, "have a

good one," so I'm asking you,
"have a good one what?"

But then, he just stares at me
until the doors closed.

And I'm sorry, but I gotta say
it, these casual pleasantries

can all go straight to hell.
At this point in the

broadcast, Seth launched into a
spontaneous and profanity filled

rant about casual pleasantries
and how he believes they are the

worst thing in the english
language.

Due to the obscene nature of his
comments, network policy

prevents us from broadcasting
them.

But due to a technical issue, we
are forced to air the video

portion of the show.
In short, Seth's position is

that words are important and
casual pleasantries are like hot

air balloons.
Colorful but ultimately empty

and by the time the ride's over,
you're 20 miles away and have

pissed in your pants.
[ Light laughter ]

He then sternly declared that he
will never have a good one nor

will he ever take her easy.
And if you say "ciao" and you're

not Italian, you can "ciao" down
on my sack.

Seth then took issue with the
expression, "don't be a

stranger," saying, "how could I
be a stranger, you know me."

You would never say don't be a
stranger to an actual stranger,

at which point, an actual
stranger appeared near his desk

and said, "are you talking to
me," to which Seth applied, "no,

do I know you?"
To which the stranger replied,

"I don't think so."
"Do I know you?"

To which Seth replied, "get the
hell out of my studio, you

creep."
at which point, the man started

to leave.
But then, Seth said, "hey,

before you go," and the man
said, "yeah?"

And then, Seth looked the man
dead in the eye and said, "don't

be a stranger."
Seth then took issue with people

who use the expression, "I can't
even," saying, "you can't even

what?"
"finish the sentence."

Is it, "I can't even dab."
Is it dabbing that you cannot

even?
Because I can dab.

In fact, I can dab cool.
Seth then dabbed a lot and

quickly, and it was upsetting
and bad.

And someone hollered from the
audience, you ruined it.

Then Seth said, "if you ever
suggest we circle back on

something, I'm going to stick my
size 12 rhombus square up your

quadrilateral, to which his
stage manager, Tom, replied,

"every rhombus is a
quadrilateral," to which Seth's

cameraman gene replied, "but not
all quadrilaterals are

rhombuses."
to which Albert Einstein

replied, "very good, gentlemen,
looks like my work here is

done."
then, as he was turning to go

back to wherever the hell he
came from, he stopped and said,

"Seth, I have something very
important to tell you."

To which Seth replied, "yes,
Albert Einstein?"

At which point, Albert Einstein
looked Seth dead in the eye and

said, "don't be a stranger."
To which Seth replied,

"[ bleep ] You,
Albert Einstein."

Albert Einstein then playfully
shimmied out of the studio

because as we all know,
Albert Einstein was famously a

little stinker.
Then something happened that we

can only legally show in a
series of courtroom-style

sketches.
Seth stood up on his desk and

shouted, "to everyone who says
it's a jungle out there, no,

bish, it's a jungle in here."
He then pulled on a rope hanging

above his desk which lifted a
curtain, revealing a live puma

in the studio, which caused the
audience to panic and stampede,

at which point, Seth said,
"relax, she's not dangerous."

At which point, the puma left
from the stage and tackled

Albert Einstein, biting off his
face and savaging his body,

before casting aside his bloody
carcass like a rag doll.

Following this, the puma turned
and set her sights on the

courtroom sketch artist brutally
savaging him as well, which

necessitated a second sketch
artist to take over drawing

duties.
Even though they were a

decidedly poorer artist and
ultimately, all of this resulted

in Seth putting his head in his
hands and saying, "I can't

even."
nbc would like to ask viewers to

disregard Seth's opinions about
casual pleasantries as they do

not reflect the network's
position and barely count as

opinions to begin with.
We now resume our broadcast.

Seth: And no, you can't pick
my brain, but you can pick my

foot out of your ass.
Whoo, that felt good.

We'll be back with music from
bebe rexha, everybody.

[ Cheers and applause ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Seth: My next guest is a
chart toping artist whose album

"expectations" is out now.
