You wanna be Atticus Finch. Good.

I like him.
Why?

He's honest.
Yes.

He stands up for the right thing.
Yes.

And he's a good father.
He is.

Did it all by himself.
Did what all by himself?

Raised his kids.
He didn't raise them by himself!.

Who was the woman that
came to their house every day?

Calpurnia.
Calpurnia. He remembered.

And what about Boo?
What about Boo?

I think that Boo Radley...

is one ofthe most interesting
characters in To KillA Mockingbird.

Excuse me.

I'm a teacher.

Xmas is not a word
in the English language.

It's either ''Merry Christmas''
or ''Happy Holidays.''

Thankyou.

Sure.

Mom, tell me more about Livia.

She killed everybody so her son Tiberius
could inherit the throne-- like Nixon.

It's awfully common.

The same stories, the Shakespeare, like
those plays we saw at the Old Globe.

Anita?
Hey, Mom.

Want something to eat?
No, thanks. I already ate.

Areyou sure? I made soy cutlets.
I'm fine. I already ate.

Wait.
You've been kissing.

No, I haven't.
Yes, you have.

I can tell.
You can't tell.

Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

Whatyou got
underyour coat?

It's unfair that we can't
listen to our music.

It's because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex.

Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

It is the poetry
ofdrugs and promiscuous sex.

Honey, they're on pot.

First, it was butter.
Then it was sugar and white flour.

Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock 'n' roll, motorcycles.

Then, it was celebrating Christmas
on a day in September...

when you knew it
wouldn't be commercialized.

What else areyou gonna ban?
You want to rebel against knowledge.

I'm trying to giveyou the Cliff's Notes
on how to live life in this world.

We're like nobody else I know!

I am a college professor.
Why can't I teach my own kids? Use me.

Darryl says thatyou
use knowledge to keep me down.

He says I'm a ''yes'' person...

and you are trying to raise us
in a ''no'' environment.

Well, clearly ''no'' is a word
Darryl doesn't hear much.

I can't live here! I hateyou!

Even William hates you.
I don't hate her.

You do hate her.
You don't even know the truth.

Don't be a drama queen.
Feckyou!

This is a house oflies!

There it is.

Your sister used the ''f'' word.
I think she said ''feck.''

What's the difference?
The letter ''u.''

Areyou really
in our grade?

Yeah.
Hey, guys, check it out.

William doesn't have
any pubes.

How old areyou, man?
He's not a man.

He's a little baby kid.
Bet he doesn't even get zits yet.

Everyone has hair.
What's wrong with you?

Pipsqueak!
What's your age, man?

How old areyou?
You're pathetic!

Where areyour pubes?

I had 'em.

I shaved 'em off.

He's a funny guy!

Seeyou, Pubes.

Hey, noodle.
Hi, guys.

Put on your seat belt.

We got our annuals today.

Receivedyour annual.
Right, received.

I look so much younger
than everyone else.

Enjoy it whileyou can.

Mom, it's time.

Can this wait till we get home?
Mom, pull over.

Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

He knows how old he is.

But other kids make fun ofhim
because ofhowyoung he looks.

Nobody includes him. They call him
''The Narc'' behind his back.

They do?
What's a narc?

A narcotics officer.
Well, what's wrong with that?

Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

I'm twelve.
She skipped me a grade.

Big deal.
I'm a yearyounger.

They're 1 3, I'm 1 2.

Aren't I?

I also putyou in first grade when
you were five, and I never told you.

So I'm how old?

Don'tyou realize that
this is gonna scar him forever?

Don't be Cleopatra. We have to be
both his mother and his dad.

You put too much pressure on him...
How old...

and when he rebels
in some strange and odd way...

don't blame me.
am I?

I skipped you
an extra grade.

You're 1 1 .

Eleven?
Soyou skipped fifth grade.

There's too much padding in the grades.
I taught elementary school.

Eleven?

You also skipped
kindergarten...

because I taught it
toyou when you were four.

This explains... so much.

You've robbed him
ofan adolescence.

Adolescence is a marketing tool.

Honey, I knowyou were
expecting puberty...

butyou'rejust gonna have to
shine it on for a little while.

Who needs a crowd?

Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

You're unique. You're twoyears
ahead ofeverybody.

Take those extra years
and do whatyou want.

Go to Europe for a year.
Take a look around.

See whatyou like.

Followyour dream.

You'll still be
theyoungest lawyer in the country.

Your dad was so proud ofyou.
He knewyou were an accelerated child.

What about me?

You are rebellious
and ungrateful ofmy love.

Well, somebody's
gotta be normal around here.

Eleven.

This song explains why I'm leaving home
to become a stewardess.

We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

I loveyou.

Here'sa theory
foryou to disregard...

completely.

Music, you know--
true music--

notjust rock 'n' roll--
it chooses you.

It lives in your car, or alone,
listening toyour headphones--

you know, with the vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

It's a place apart...

from the vast, benign...

lap ofAmerica.

Did you know that ''The Letter''
byThe Box Tops...

was a minute, 58 seconds long?
Means nothing. Nil.

But it takes them less than two minutes
to accomplish...

whatJethro Tull takes hours
to not accomplish!

See this? This is fatuous,
pseudo blubber!

You know--
Which is fine, but...

to foist it offas art--

OrThe Doors?Jim Morrison?

He's a drunken buffoon
posing as a poet.

I like the Doors.
Give me the Guess Who.

They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons. Which makes them poetic!

It's quite an honor to have
the world's greatest rock critic...

and editor of Creem magazine...

back home in San Diego
for a few days.

Lester Bangs.
Live ''American Woman''?

Haveyou ever--

The most brilliant piece
ofgobbledygook ever.

Give me some
''White Light/White Heat.''

Iggy Pop!

Amen!

Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist either.

Isn't it a bit early for that?
Not for me.

That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom, and here is Iggy Pop.

Soyou're thekid who'ssentme those
articles from theschoolnewspaper.

Yeah. Yeah.

I've been doing some stuff for
a local underground paper also.

What areyou, the star ofyour school?
They hate me.

You'll meet them all again
on their longjourney to the middle.

Yourwriting is damn good. It'sjust
a shameyou missed out on rock 'n' roll.

It's over.
Over?

It's over. You got here
just in time for the death rattle.

Last gasp.
Last grope.

At least I'm here for that.
What doyou type on?

Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

And you like Lou Reed?
The early stuff.

In his new stuff,
he's trying to be Bowie.

He shouldjust be himself.

Yeah, but if Bowie's
doin' Lou...

and if Lou's doin' Bowie,
Lou is still doin' Lou.

Ifyou like Lou.

You take drugs?
No.

Smart kid.

I used to do speed.

You know, and sometimes
a little cough syrup?

I'd stay up all night,
just writing and writing.

I mean,
like 25 pages ofdribble--

You know, about The Faces,
or Coltrane.

You know,just to fucking write.

All right.
It's been nice to meetya.

Keep sending meyour stuff.

I can't stand here all day
talking to my many fans.

Right, yeah. I understand.

Okay.
Good-bye.

Yeah. Bye.

Bye.
Bye.

You need a ride?

No, man,
I took the bus.

You know, because onceyou go to L.A.,
you're gonna have friends like crazy.

But they're gonna be fake friends.
They're gonna try to corruptyou.

You got an honest face,
and they're gonna tell you everything.

Butyou cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

Is it okay ifI--
Ifyou're gonna be a truejournalist--

you know, a rockjournalist--

First, you never get paid much.

Butyou will get free records
from the record company.

Jesus.

Fucking nothing aboutyou
that is controversial, man.

God, it's gonna get ugly, man.
They're gonna buyyou drinks.

You're gonna meet girls, they're gonna
flyyou places for free, offer drugs.

I know it sounds great,
but these people are notyour friends.

These are people who wantyou
to write sanctimonious stories...

about the genius ofrock stars.

And theywill ruin rock 'n' roll,
and strangle...

everything we love
about it, you know?

'Cause they're trying
to buy respectability...

for a form that is gloriously
and righteously dumb.

You know, you're smart enough
to know that.

And the day it ceases
to be dumb...

is the day it
ceases to be real, right?

And then itjust becomes
an industry ofcool.

I'm telling you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock 'n' roll.

I mean, the war is over.
Theywon.

And 99% ofwhat passes
for rock 'n' roll these days...

silence
is more compelling.

That's why I thinkyou should turn,
go back, and be a lawyer or something.

But I can tell from your face
thatyou won't.

I can giveyou 35 bucks.

Give me 1 ,000 words on Black Sabbath.
An assignment?

You have to makeyour reputation
on being honest...

and...

you know, unmerciful.

Honest.

Unmerciful.

Ifyou get into ajam,
you can call me.

I stay up late.

Look at this.

An entire generation ofCinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

Youjust remember, you wanted to be
Abraham Lincoln.

You wanted to be Atticus Finch in
To KillA Mockingbird.

You want to get high?
Looking to get high?

All I have to do is listen.

That's what Lester Bangs said.
As long as I know this is a hobby.

I'll pickyou up right here
at 1 1 :00 sharp.

Ifyou get lost,
use the familywhistle.

Good luck.
Thanks.

Don't take drugs!

Yes, Mother!

Hi. I'm William Miller.

I'm here from Creem magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.

Not on the list.

Sir, I'm ajournalist. Here's a copy--
You're not on the list.

Go to the top ofthe ramp
with the other girls.

We won't bite.

What happens after
I go to the top ofthe ramp?

Who areyou with?

Me? I'm with myself.

No. Who areyou with?
What band?

Oh. I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm ajournalist.

I'm not-- Not a--
You know.

You're not a what?

You're not a what?

I'm not a... groupie.

We are not groupies.

This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

Groupies sleep with rock stars 'cause
theywanna be near someone famous.

We're here because ofthe music.
We are Band Aids.

-She used to run a school for Band Aids.
-We don't have intercourse with them.

We support the music.
We inspire the music.

We're here
because ofthe music.

Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.
It's famous.

It's a long story.

I'm retired now.
Visiting friends.

She was the one
who changed everything.

She was the one who said,
''No more sex.

No more exploiting
our bodies and our hearts.''

Right.
-Just blowjobs, that's it.

It's all happening!
It's all happening!

Okay, this is
ourjournalist friend.

Journalist friend,
meet Polexia Aphrodisia.

Estrella Starr.

And you are--

William Miller.

Here comes Sabbath!
Ozzy! Tony, it's us!

It's me, Polexia!

I think I saw Sapphire in there.

Does anybody remember laughter?

Sapphire!

Come on!
Passes, girls!

Come and get 'em!

No, not this one.
Who brought Opie?

He's with us.
Top ofthe ramp!

Don't go anywhere, Opie.
I'll take care ofthis.

IfI can.

Come on, boys.
Pick it up, will ya?

This is outrageous.
We're an hour and a halflate!

I'm coming, I'm coming.

Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

I'm ajournalist.
I write for Creem magazine.

Oh, the Enemy.
A rockwriter.

Right. I'd like to interviewyou
or somebody from your band.

Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?

We play for the fans,
not the critics.

Russell,Jeff...

Ed, Larry.

I really loveyour band.

I think the song ''Fever Dog''
is a big step forward foryou.

And you guys producing ityourselves
instead ofGlynJohns...

that was the right thing to do.

And Russell, Russell,
the guitar sound...

is incendiary.

In-Incendiary.

Way to go.

Hey, man.
Don't stop there.

I'm incendiary too, man.
I didn't mean ''fuck off.''

How areyou doing?
He's with us. This way, bro.

He's not on your list!
Here's a list ofpeople who do belong.

Takeastraightandstrongercourse

Hey, Red Dog.

Hey-hey! We're playin' here
tomorrow night, man.

Yeah?
Howyou doin', brother?

Good to seeyou, man.
You too.

That's the Allman Brothers
Band's number one roadie.

How are the guys?
Havin' a ball, man. Havin' a ball.

You know, when we party, we have
an Allman Brothers Band party, man.

Everybody's boogyin'. Everybody's
gettin' off. Like family, man.

Hey, we got these now.

Check that out.

Yeah, you can taste the colors
with your mind, brother.

Y'all gonna be
in Maryland, right?

Yeah.
All right, all right.

Hey, Dickey and Gregg
send you love, brother.

Cool.

Take it easy.
Same toyou, brother.

Seeya, man.

Somepeoplehaveahard time
explaining rock 'n'roll--

really explain rock 'n' roll.

Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle
and a way ofthinking...

and it's not about money
and popularity.

Although some moneywould be nice.

But it's a voice that says,
''Here I am...

and fuckyou
ifyou can't understand me.''

And one ofthese people
is gonna save the world.

And that means that rock 'n' roll
can save the world...

all ofus together.

And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that thing.

The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

What I'm talking about is--
Wait, what am I talking about?

The buzz.
The buzz.

And the chicks, the whatever...

is an offshoot ofthe buzz.

Likeyou saying
you liked ''Fever Dog.''

That is the fucking buzz!

Found you a pass.

Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

Oh. Stillwater.

Nowyou're mysterious.

How old areyou?

Eighteen.
Me too.

How old are we really?

Seventeen.
Me too.

Actually, I'm 1 6.

Me too. Isn't it funny?

The truthjust sounds different.
I'm 1 5.

What's your real name?

I'll never tell.

The Enemy!

Russell! Hey.

This is Penny Lane.

Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

Pleasure.

''Penny Lane,'' like the song.
Have we met?

Oh. Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.

It's not whatyou
put into it.

It's whatyou leave out.

Listen to Marvin Gaye.

A song like
''What's Happening, Brother?''

There's a single ''whoo''
at the end ofthe second verse.

You know that ''whoo,''
that single ''whoo''?

I know that ''whoo.''
Yeah. Whoo.

Yeah! That's what
you remember, man.

It's the little things,
the silly things.

The mistakes. There's only one of'em,
and it makes the song.

It's whatyou leave out.

Truly.
Yeah, that's rock 'n' roll.

Whatyou leave out.

And you're supposed to be the enemy.
What areyou, 1 8?

Yes.
Thereyou go.

Still young enough to be honest.

All right. Come on.

We want her around,

Hey, be cool.

Penny, youjust missed Russell.

He said he's at the Riot House all week,
and foryou to call him.

He's under the name
Harry Houdini.

You know about the Riot House, right?
I think I've heard ofit.

He had a message. He said, ''Tell her
it's not California withoutyou.

We wantyou around,
like last summer.''

No! He said, ''Tell her it ain't
California withoutyou, we want--''

I get the gist.
Right.

So, how well doyou guys
know each other?

Call me ifyou need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

I think I live
in a different world.

Speaking ofthe world...

I've made a decision.

I'm gonna live in Morocco
for oneyear.

I need a new crowd.

Doyou wanna come?

Yes.

You sure?
Ask me again.

Doyou wanna come?

You've gotta call me.
Okay.

It's all happening.

It's all happening.
It's all happening.

You all right?
Yeah, yeah. Great.

Andit'snotaboutmoney

Andthe chicksare great. Right?

Hey, Darryl.
Hey.

So, your sister's
a stewardess now.

Yeah, yeah. She and Mom
are still sorta--

I'd say not speaking...

but I don't know
that they ever did.

The things your sister and I
used to do inside these fourwalls.

That's okay. That's okay.
I don't want to know.

It is my room now.
We flew the friendly skies.

Okay, okay, okay.

You seem cooler.

I am-- I am thinking
about going to Morocco.

Let me know ifyou need
a little help with your mom.

Little may not be enough.
Yeah, she still freaks me out.

Yeah.
She's famous.

Listen, um, I--

Go ahead and do
whateveryou were doing.

I'm just gonna
hang in here for a moment.

Okay.

I worryabout
drunk drivers.

I worryabout
drunk drivers.

Mom, I'm 1 5.
Right?

Yes, you're 1 5.

And here's that money
I oweyou.

Your father's favoritejoke.
I don't do it as well.

No, I thought
that was pretty good.

Keep the small bills on the outside,
and call me ifanyone gets drunk.

I will call you ifanyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

Good.
And don't take drugs.

Ha-ha. Very funny.

See? Sense ofhumor.

Funnyjoke. Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

Mom, stay.
Okay.

Loveyou. Bye.

I always tell the girls,
never take it seriously.

Ifyou never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

Ifyou never get hurt,
you always have fun.

And ifyou ever get lonely...

youjust go to the record store...

and visityour friends.

Soyou and Russell--
No!

Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

It's all happening.
I'm about to useyou as protection.

These guys are with Alice Cooper.
I'm gonna pretend I don't know them.

Penny. Hey. Does Alice
knowyou're here?

Oh, I'm just showing myvery dear, very
wonderful friend William Miller around.

He's a very important writer.
He knows Lester Bangs.

And I'm responsible
for his moral conduct while he's abroad.

Penny Lane!
God's gift to rock 'n' roll.

I'm retired,
and don't argue with me!

''Retired''? Again?
Penny!

Oh, it's Reg.
That's Humble Pie's road manager.

Penny, come to Portland
with us, love.

Have we met?
Have we met?

I've made a decision.

I'm going traveling
to India...

and then I'm going
to learn to play the violin.

And then I'm going to college...
for oneyear.

There's nothing they could teach you
in college, darling.

Right on.

Call Alice. He's staying under
the name Bob Hope.

I heard you were with Russell Hammond.
Please. I throw the little ones back.

I lost my head.

Martin Bell's
a fucking asshole!

And I'm in love with
Jeff Bebe.

Polexia!
Opie?

Areyou okay?
Harry Houdini, please.

Houdini--
Harry Houdini!

It was Sable.
Sable, Sable.

And we had this really great night.

He said it was going to
mean something and--

And I'm in love withJeff!.
-Jeffis a great guy.

I saw them on the 7th floor.

Mr.Jimmy Page, Mr.John PaulJones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

Mr. Robert Plant, he signed--

signed myT-shirt five minutes ago.

Please don't smear it.
Oh, dear God. Please don't smear it.

But five minutes ago,
he touched this pen.

Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
I picked that up.

He tours with them,
but not, you know, with them.

Yeah, they're on the twelfth floor now.

There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

William Miller.

Hey, you're that comedian.
Leonard.

Blow me!

Okay, time to put on
the lampshade.

Ladies and gentlemen!

At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

for the captain has turned on
the ''No Smoking'' sign.

Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

and in their full,
upright position.

The hell with it.

Play on.
Miss Penny Lane.

Oh, thankyou, thankyou.

Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

about him.

Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

but he goes right for her.

Act Three, in which
it all plays out...

the way she planned it.

She'll eat him alive.

We've got to stop them.
Stop them?

You were her excuse
for coming here.

I need ice.

I worry about people using her.

'Cause she brings out
the good side in everybody else...

but what do they do for her?

Life kills me.
Doyou have any pot?

No. Not on me.

Doyou smoke?
No.

But, I-I grow it.

Yeah. Grow it.

Funny-- Funny...

ifyou were only taller and English
and rich and a guitar player...

and older.

I'd-- I'd be
somebody else.

Yeah. Good point.

The Enemy.

I'm always around ifyou
wanna talk some more.

Okay.
All right.

Bless me, father,
for I may sin tonight.

How does it end?
What?

The story about the girl who dumps
the guywho has the ex-ex wife?

Calls her a hundred--
Okay, five times...

and doesn't even leave
a pass in San Diego.

I mean, wake up.

I'm retired.

I never believed you, anyway.

You're too good-looking and
too talented to be trusted.

Everybody knows that.

You're retired
like Frank Sinatra's retired.

Miss Penny Lane, let me tell you
what rock 'n' roll will miss...

the day that
you truly retire.

The way thatyou turn
a hotel room into a home.

The way thatyou pick up strays
whereveryou go.

The way thatyou--
You know the words to every song.

Every song,
especially the bad ones.

It's mostly
the bad ones.

That green coat

The real name
thatyou won't reveal.

I could keep goin',
but my glass is full.

Damn.

Comin' to Arizona?

Never.

Leave Thursday morning, 9 a.m.,
and pack light this time.

Jesus.

William Miller?
This ishe.

This is Ben Fong-Torres. I'm the
music editor at RollingStone magazine.

Wegota couple copies ofyourstories
from the San Diego Door.

Is this the same William Miller?
Yes, it is.

''Voice ofGod, howling dogs,
the spirit ofrock 'n' roll.''

This is good stuff, man.
Thanks.

Uh, thanks. Thanks.

I thinkyou should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

How about Stillwater?
Stillwater?

''Hard-working band makes good.''
New album out, their third.

Starting to do something. Crazy.

Let's do 3,000 words.
We'lljoin thebandon theroad.

Don't let the band
pay for anything.

We can onlypay, letmesee...

3,000 words--

Seven hundred dollars.

All right, a grand.

What'syourbackground?
Areyouajournalism major?

Yeah.
Whatcollege?

Honey, Ineedyou to do that thing
thatfixes thegarbage disposal.

Well, I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

Crazy.
Crazy.

Stillwater?

Beware, beware of
RollingStone magazine...

because theywill
changeyour story...

they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill--

But besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

You got starry eyes, my friend.

Look. Do the story.

Who cares, you know?
It'll be good forya.

Remember this: Don't do it
to make friends with people...

who are trying to useyou...

to further the big business desire...

toglorify worthless rockstars
likeStillwater!

Don'tlet those
swillmerchants rewriteyou.

''Swill merchants.'' That's good.
Yeah, swillmerchants.

What areyou listening to?
Stillwater.

Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

No more than four days...

and I wantyou to give me
a phone numberwhereyou are.

I wantyou to call me twice a day,
and you do not miss more than one test!

And no drugs.

Oh, this is a big mistake.

Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

This is what I was talking about.
Russell, excuse me.

I was wondering
ifmaybe we could...

find some time to talk
when we get to Phoenix.

I want to interview everyone separately,
and I thought we'd start with...

-justyou and me.
Absolutely.

Because I got a thing
in a couple ofdays.

What?
Oh, it's a thing...

whereyou go there
to graduate.

School.

I never graduated.
Lookwhat happened.

You're here
interviewing me.

Don't put that
in RollingStone.

Man, our bio says
that we all graduated.

Him with honors.

We'll figure out
something better later, okay?

Just enjoy the ride.

Keep playing that song.
All right.

I may need to stay
in your room tonight.

Russell's in a bad mood.

He's very Bob Dylan
in Don'tLook Back today.

He's trying to write.
Yeah. Sure.

Yeah?
Sure.

You okay?
Yeah.

Could you put a ''Do not
disturb'' on my phone?

Here's your key.

Larry, Silent,
bag's in 1 0.

Come by in a few minutes.
We'll do that interview.

All right?
Sure.

Is this Mr. Miller?
Yeah.

You have a message from Elaine.

Your mother.

She's a handful.

I know.
She freaked me out.

Tell her to stop.

I'm worried, man.

No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

But it's RollingStone.

He looks harmless, but he does represent
the magazine that trashed ''Layla''...

broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

Don't forget the rules, man.
This little shit is the Enemy.

He writes what he sees.

IfI don't get into a room
and take a Valium--

Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

You are going to get me
in so much trouble!

Oh, my God.

Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

Housekeeping.

Go away!

Should I come by later?

Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood.

Maybe that's a good thing.
Go away!

You okay?
Yeah.

Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

Go away!

Bye.
You're so rude.

The guitar and songwriting
of Russell Hammond.

The vocal stylings ofJeff''Behbay''--
''Baybay''--Jeff''Baybay''--

''Behbay.''
Uh, Bebe.

Bebe.
''Fever Dog.''

The band is Stillwater.

Watch with your mind
as they materialize.

Look at the dogs wearing the funny hats,
jugglingjust foryou...

freaks and family.

It's Quince with Stillwater,
here, live.

It's The Night Circus.

Every minute
a baby is born somewhere.

Life, death...

hermetically sealed bags
ofhuman emotion--

bags oflove.

Bags ofkindness?

How'd you all get together?

Well, not to get into a ''me'' thing,
but I did start the band...

some time, actually, ago...

and I placed an ad in
a magazine called Peaches...

and Russell Hammond answered.

Peaches.

I think it was a gift
from God, actually.

Nobody plays
like Russell Hammond.

Aw, shit, man. Thankyou.

Oh, right. You might want
to hit that delay button there, Quincy.

Quince?

Now we're talkin', right?

Right? Why the fuck
doyou have to wait...

till an interview in Arizona
to say something nice about me?

Why don'tyou say it
to my fucking face sometimes?

'Cause I tell you every time
I thinkyou nail something.

Everybody pays you
compliments.

It's not
my fuckingjob...

to kiss
your fucking ass.

Seriously, then whose
fuckingjob is it...

because my ass is dying
for a kiss, man...

and I know
yours is too.

It's my fuckingjob,
and I thinkyou're all geniuses...

and I'd like to say
to the folks out there--

I'd like to leaveyou
with this thought: smegma.

Nice.

Fellas?
Feces.

The name ofthe song...

is ''Love Thing.''

Your mind is starting
to take effect.

They've all come
to watch you swallow fire.

You scream...

soundlessly
on The Night Circus.

I thought that went well.

Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.

May I speakwith William?
He'sstillin thebar with theband.

Theyjust got back from the radio
station. Is this Maryann, with the pot?

Hello?

No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

This is Elaine.
His mother.

Could you give William
a message for me, please?

Tellhim to callhomeimmediately,
andalso tellhim...

I know what's going on.

Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

You should be
really proud ofhim.

'Cause I know men,
and I'll betyou do too.

He respects women,
andhelikes women.

Andlet'sjustpause
andappreciateamanlike that.

You created him out ofthin air,
you know, you raised him right.

He's having a great time.
He's doing a goodjob.

And, don't worry, he'sstilla virgin,
andwe'realllookingoutforhim.

You know? That's more than I've
ever even said to my own parents.

So thereyougo.

This is themaidspeaking,
by the way.

Can you please hold it down?
Sorry, ma'am!

Russell! So, what is it
you love about music?

Shut that thing off for a second
and I'll tell you the truth, all right?

Look-- Fuck. I trustyou,
so I'm just gonna lay this right on ya.

Just make us look cool.

I will quoteyou
warmly and accurately.

Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

Some ofus...

we got girlfriends
back home, you know?

Some ofus have wives.

And some ofthe people
thatyou meet on the road...

are really amazing people.

Likeyou.

But some ofthe stuffthat happens,
it's good for...

a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

a million people.

Understand what I'm trying to say?
Yeah.

'Cause, see,
you're dangerous.

You see everything.

Most people,
they'rejust waiting to talk.

Butyou listen.

See, I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

I'm past 'em,
as musicians, but...

the more popularwe get,
the bigger their houses get...

the more responsibilities,
the pressure, you know--

The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

Then you forget--

forget what it's like
to be a fan.

You hear it in bands all the time.

Doesn't sound
like music anymore, you know?

Sounds like--

lifestyle maintenance
or something.

''Lifestyle maintenance.''
That's--

I used to be able
to hear...

the sounds ofthe world--
everything.

To me,
it sounded like music.

And now I don't hear it,
you know, anymore.

Doyou understand
what I'm trying to say?

Yeah. Yeah.

Help me!

What am I doing?

I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

We'll do the interview tomorrow.

So tonight, it's--
Well, friends.

Yeah, right.
We trustya.

Larry Fellows, how would you describe
your role in Stillwater?

What is the chemical
you add to the chemistry?

I'm the bass player.

Right.

And when you take that away,
what would be missing?

Stylistically,
what chemical?

The bass?

Okay.

Hey, what's going on?
Russell just got electrocuted!

Okay! Everybody, be cool!

Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

This is bullshit, man.
Who's taking care ofus?

Who's responsible for the gear?
I'm gonna deal with it.

Get on the bus!
Please, everyone!

Let's go!
Hey, cowboy.

You the manager ofthis band?
That and more!

You didn't finish
your full set, man.

Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

You trashed my fucking dressing room,
and you didn't doyour 25 minutes.

-Don't fuckwith my band's safety, ever!
-Fuckyou, man!

I'm gonna reportyou
to every promoter in this country!

I'm gonna talk
to Frank Barcelona tonight!

You don't know Frank Barcelona!

You're a bunch ofamateurs!
Fuck off!.

You want it?
Come on!

What doyou got?

Hey, watch the shirt, fuck!
Now I'm gonna kickyour ass.

Take it easy. Take it easy, man.

I hopeyou got
a good lawyer.

You better make a live album,
'cause this is your last fuckin' tour!

What? What?

Fuck off!.
What is that? What areyou, Bruce Lee?

Come on. Come on.
Come on!

Take it easy!
Dick, let's go!

Lock the gates!

Let's go through the fucking gate.
This is your last fucking tour, man!

Lock the gates
on these fuckheads!

Where's my goddamn cart?
William?

I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

She says you gotta
call home immediately.

And she says to tell you,
''I know what's going on.''

So, I'll seeyou guys
in Topeka, okay?

Amateurs!

You don't know whoyou're
dealing with here! Lock the gates!

You wanna buy a gate?
Yeah!

Youjust bought a gate!

Hey, give that
to me, William.

Give me that!

Russell, wake up.

Wake the fuck up, man.
It's a girls' running team.

Goddamn!

Let it go.
Let it go, buddy.

When do we get in to Topeka, man?

Larry, you're a sick individual.
Wake up, man.

Look at all these fucking
tasty-looking high school girls.

We can't stop the bus every time
you see a girl in shorts.

Hey, when we go to Morocco...

I thinkwe should wear
completely different clothes...

and be completely different people.

What will our names be?

What doyou think of Russell?

I like him.

But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

You should give 'em a break.
There are real problems in the band.

Offthe record.
What problems?

Okay, I got it. Your name should be
Spencer, and mine will beJane.

I can't keep up with you.
Oh, no one can.

You're comin'
to Cleveland, right?

Cleveland, Ohio?
Oh, no.

I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

You've got to help me, okay?
Here's the thing about Russell.

He's my last project.

I only do this for a very few people,
and I thinkwe should do it together.

Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

What's your real name?

All right, let's go!

Oh, it's okay.
I'm easy to forget.

Just leave me behind!

I'm only the fucking lead singer!

So, Ed Vallencourt...

what doyou love
about music?

Okay. Okay.

You toldmeyou'dtellme
whereyou were everyminute.

You toldmeyou would
callme twicea day.

You told meyou wouldn't miss tests.
I'llbehome forgraduation.

Mom--
Whereareyou?

Right now, Topeka.
Then Greenville, then home.

Whataboutgraduation?
Wehadanagreement, William.

I'm sorry I didn't
call you yesterday.

I guess I just miss you,
and I don't understand...

why I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

Byallpracticalrules,
don'tIgetyouforanotherthreeyears?

Was I not fun?

Yes.

This is Beth from Denver.

She's one ofthe legendary,
original Band Aids.

She's clairvoyant!
I can't read your mind or anything.

Imean, Ipick up things
hereandthere.

Estrella says hi.

She says I can stay in your room.
Sure.

Great. I'vegotsome...

hydroponic pot!

Wow, your aura
is really fantastic!

It's this beautiful purple color.
Iloveyou.

I missed the last thing you said.

Youraura ispurple!
I loveyou.

What?
Purple!It'spurple!

Mom, what?
Youraura ispurple.

I miss you and I loveyou!

I loveyou.

All right.
Fire away. I'm ready.

Doyou have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

Doyou have to be in love
to write a love song?

Is the song better
ifit really happened toyou?

Like ''Love Thing.'' Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

When did you get
so professional?

Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

It's the record company's mistake,
and theywill pay.

T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

Can wejust skip the vibe, and go
straight to us laughing about this?

Yeah, okay.

Because I can see byyour face
you want to get into it.

How can you tell?
I'm just one ofthe out-of-focus guys.

Here. Take it.

Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

See, you love this T-shirt.

It lets you say
everything you want to say.

Well, it speaks
pretty loudly to me.

It's a T-shirt.

Doyou give a shit
about a T-shirt?

I'm just hungry, man. Let'sjust go out
and find some barbecue or something.

I'm always gonna tell you the truth.
Areyou doing coke again?

Oh, yeah!
All the time!

This is big stuff, man.

From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

That's the dynamic we agreed on.

Page, Plant, Mick, Keith,
Blackmore, Gillan.

But somehow it's all turning around.

We have got to control
what's happening!

There's a responsibility here.
Excuse me.

Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

I can't say any more
with the writer here.

You can trust him.
Saywhatyou want.

He won't write it.

I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

You know what I do?
I connect.

I get people off!.

I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

and I make him get off.

Actually, thatyou can print!

And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm ajoke toyou?

You want to pretend this isn't
gonna be a very big band? Well, it is!

You call yourself
a leader ofthis band...

butyour direction
allowed this T-shirt...

when you allowed Dick
to manage us.

'Cause he's your friend!

Don'tyou see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

Is it my turn now?

Because I thinkwe should, for once,
saywhat we really mean.

This is the part whereyou quit!
Right. I'm so predictable.

Deal with it.

And let me say
what nobody else wants to say.

What?
Your looks have become a problem!

All right, enough!
Break it up.

Everyone out ofthe room
for five minutes.

Hey! Yeah.
William. Sorry.

Come on, man. Come on.

Let's go find something real.

From here on out, I'm only interested
in what is real.

Real people, real feelings.
That's it.

That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

You're real.

Thanks.
You know...

you know all about us,
and I don't know shit aboutyou.

Tell me,
what's your family like?

My dad died ofa heart attack...

and my sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

that she had to escape our family...

and they can't seem to find
a way to get through it.

I mean, they don't even speak
to each other anymore.

Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess?

It's good to talk about.

Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

to the one guyyou're not supposed to
tell your secrets to.

You're Russell from Stillwater.

Well, yeah, on my better days,
I am Russell from Stillwater.

Hey, you wanna go to a partywith me
at my friend Aaron's house?

I mean, I knowyou're
a big rock star and all...

but doyou wanna hang with some good
people looking to have a good time?

We'rejust real Topeka people, man.
Smoke some righteous weed.

Thanks.
You too.

Oh, my God! Holy shit!

Fuck!
I grew up with that lamp shade.

I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

That's William over there.
Hey, William!

You, Aaron,
are what it's all about.

You're real.

Your room is real.
Your friends are real.

Real, man, real.
You know? Real.

Real. You know?

You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

Silly machinery.
And you know it!

In eleven years, it's gonna be 1 984,
man. Think about that!

Wanna see me feed a mouse
to my snake?

Yes.

Can I have that bitchin' belt?
Take it.

Thanks, man.
Thankyou, brother.

Russell, we should probably
get backwith the others.

Oh, it's over, daddy.
Hey...

there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

That's mine.

Topeka. Check it out.

Please, don't give him any more acid.
Thankyou.

Dick? Dick, I got him.

He's okay.

He is on acid, though.

I can't really tell.
How doyou know when it's kicked in?

I am a golden god!

Yes, you are!

I am a golden god!
Hey, Russell!

Don'tjump.

And you can tell
RollingStone magazine...

that my last words...

were...

I'm on drugs.

I thinkwe should work
on those last words!

Okay. Oh, I got it, I got it.
I got it.

I got it. I got it.
This is better.

Last words.

I dig music.

I'm on drugs!

Look,just come on down...

and we'll go back to the hotel.

Okay.

-Jump.
-Jump!

He's not coming up.
Something's wrong.

Somebody help him.

I'll saveyou, Russell!

They'vebeen crying foryou
likeabunch ofwhimperingpussies.

Oh, thisband's over.

This is my family now.
That's right.

Right, man.
Definitely.

He's staying with us.
Let'sjust ride on down to Greenville.

We'll listen to some great music.
We'll finish the tour...

and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

Then we'll come back here,
whereyou'll live.

That sounds good.
Yeah, and he can stay in our basement.

-I see whatyou're doing, and I like it.
-Okay, good.

Come on.

I got it, man, I got it.
Yeah.

That felt kinda good, though.

Excuse me, kids.

Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

How do we know
you're not a cop? Huh?

The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

He's your guardian angel,
all right?

Don't worry. He only means half
ofwhat he says.

Which half?

Dick,justhelpmeget
myinterview.

I have to go home, Dick.
Okay, okay.

I have to go home.
Look.

You saved the tour, and that's
good enough for now, all right?

Come on, big fella, let's go.
I hurt the flower.

Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

We hopeyou all enjoyed yourselves.

And we'll seeyou all again in 1 974.
Good evening!

In CarlJung's opinion...

we all have a sixth sense--
intuition.

When you meet someone and you suddenly
feel likeyou can't live without them...

this could be the memory ofa past love
from the collective unconscious.

Or, it couldjust be hormones.

I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

On the whole, I'dsay
mostofthe fuck-ups in the world...

come from thebrain
andnot theinstincts.

Mywhole thing is
to try and make my--

Mywhole thing is to try and make
my brain go away...

but I can't,
except onstage.

The brain, I think...

should be a softening influence
on the instincts...

but the instincts should drive...

trying to reconcile
the brain with urges...

that come out
ofmillions ofyears ago.

The way the brain
interprets these instincts...

is a heavy trip.

Vallencourt, areyougetting
on the fuckingbus, or what?

Let's get on the bus and go.

Usually, I'm brain...

andRussellis instincts.

Buton the days when
we'reboth instinct...

that's when we'vemade themusic
peopleknowbest.

Becauseit's thebest.

Show me any guywho ever said he didn't
want to be popular...

and I'll showyou
a scared guy.

I've studied
the entire history ofmusic.

Most ofthe time,
the best stuffis the popular stuff.

It's much safer to say
popularity sucks...

because that allows you
to forgiveyourselfifyou suck.

And I don't forgive myself.
Doyou?

Lester, Rolling Stone is callingme.

I don't have my key interview.
I don't know what to say.

Days arejust going by out here.

You're flipping out. It's good.
All right.

This is howyou blow their minds.
He's gonna askyou--

This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
Yeah, yeah.

He'sgonnaaskyou
howthestory'sgoing...

and this is whatyou do.

Tell him...

you know, it's a--
it's a think-piece...

Think-piece.

aboutamid-levelband...

struggling with
their own limitations...

in the, you know,
harsh face ofstardom.

Harsh... face--

Yeah, he'll wet himself.

All dressed up and no place to go.

Greenville--
I'm bored.

Who hid the quaaludes
from me?

I have to pee.

Wow. They're cute.

Let's deflower the kid.

Whoa, hold on, hold on.
Wait.

I should leave. I think
things are going backwards for me.

Backwards?
Well, I don't know. I just--

I thought maybe we could hang out,
you know, do some stuffback home...

like regular stuff...

get to know each other
a little bit better...

and then I'd seeyou pee.

I mean, you know, that'sjust the way
I usually do it.

You're one ofus.

Ifyou come to Cleveland...

Bowie's gonna be at Swingo's,
the greatest hotel in America.

I'll introduceyou to him
and his security guard, Dennis.

Don'tyou have any regular friends?

Famous people
arejust more interesting.

Well, I would be worried
that theywere using me.

Boy, ifthis was the real world...

Not that anybody's using you!
and some guy talked to me like that--

No. Hold on.

I'm not famous. But--

Your time has come!
Did Russell call?

Deflower.
Opie must die.

Pants him, girls.
Stop. We're talking.

Opie must die.

Okay.
No, come on!

No, come on, please.

Guys, come on, I have to write.

Baby, yes.

Come on, Penny,join us.

Takea vacation fromyourself.
Leave this up toprofessionals.

Don't worry, William.

I'veseen the future,
andthisall works outreasonably well.

Reasonably?

Hello?

Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres

Hi, Ben Fong-Torres
from RollingStone.

Hello, hello.

You're out there tointerview
andreport. Yougotme?

Now, this isn't Creem magazine.
This is RollingStone.

We need this story in four days.
Now I wanna know how it's shaping up.

It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

struggling with theirown limitations
in theharsh face ofstardom.

That's great.

I like what we're saying.

Let me try and getyou
a thousand more words.

Now, it's in consideration
forthe cover...

butdon't tell theband.

The coverof Rolling Stone magazine.
Crazy.

Crazy.

Some coffee.

Me too.
Greenville is so boring.

You know, any other city
in the world...

and you'd still be a virgin.

Oh, God. Oh, God.
What?

I've neverwritten anything more
than a few pages in mywhole life.

Don't worry, baby, you will.

I gotta find Russell.
I gotta find Russell.

Oh, will you take the laundry?

Take the laundry?

What am I toyou?
Huh? Tell me.

Tell me right now.
What am I toyou?

Excuse me, sir,
would you mind signing for this?

Good morning.

Please go the fuck away!

Hey, man, we'll, uh,
do the interview in Cleveland.

I can't go to Cleveland.

Come on, man.
We'll have more time there.

Don't be tense.

Come to Cleveland.
Come to Cleveland.

I can't go to Cleveland.

Hey, can we help it
ifwe like having you around?

I don't wanna go
to Cleveland!

Okay? I want to go home.

That's good, man.
I like it when you yell.

But I'm not gonna letyou miss out
on the rock mecca ofthe Midwest.

Rock mecca.
Hey, you're with us.

Rock 'n' roll?

Rock...
And roll.

It's all--
I know. I know.

It's all happening.

Hi.

Oh, my God!
It's Stillwater!

Hi, welcome to Swingo's Celebrity Inn.
You must be Stillwater.

''Memory ofa Free Festival,''
''Wild-Eyed Boy of Freecloud.''

I mean, that's vintage Bowie,
you know?

New stuff-- I mean,
Ziggy Stardust is good, but it's--

It's mass media, you know?
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.

It's Bowie! Bowie!
Bowie!

All right, that's doubles.

JeffandRussellare
the figureheads oftheband...

but the true Stillwater fan,
your absolute Stillwater fan...

knows that the purity, the essence,
the core ofStillwater's music...

comes from
Silent Ed Vallencourt.

Hi, Mom.
I'm flying back Monday morning.

No, no, no,
I'll only miss one test.

I'llbeback forgraduation.

Tellheryou'reaslave to thegroove.
Youcan'thelpit.

Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

Hey, how does it feel
to be the mother ofthe greatest...

rockjournalist we'vemet?

Hello?

Look, you got a great kid here.
There's nothing to worry about.

We're taking good care ofhim.
You should come to the show sometime.

Hey, listen tome, mister.
-Join the circus.

Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm ontoyou.

Oh, ofcourseyou like him.

Well, yeah.

He worships you people.

And that's fine byyou
as long as he helps makeyou rich.

Rich? I don't think so. We sit--
Listen tome.

He'sasmart, good-hearted
15-year-oldkid...

with infinitepotential.

This isnotsomeapron-wearingmother

He's not ready foryourworld

and diminished brain cells

Am I speaking toyou clearly?

Yes, ma'am.
Ifyoubreakhis spirit...

which is law...

something you may not value,
but I do...

at the otherendofthis telephone.

And it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

Uh, yes, ma'am.
Ididn'task forthis role...

but I'll play it.

Now go doyour best.

''Be bold and mighty forces
will come toyour aid.''

Goethe said that.

It's not too late foryou to become
a person ofsubstance, Russell.

Everybodyknows

Yeah, youhadtobe there

Girl, youhadtobe there

When you play a great show
like tonight--

Okay, I need everyone's attention,
please.

Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

Right.
Well, it seems the rumors are true.

The record company has sent
a big-time manager here...

to try and talkyou
into replacing me.

His name is Dennis Hope.
I knowyou've all heard ofhim.

He's got all the big bands,
and he's outside right now...

and he wants five minutes with you.

And, well, I think
we've gotta do this.

Well, send him in.
Yeah, bring him in.

We'll send him out on a rail!
All right.

We'll finish the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from Maryland, okay?

Hey, we've already got a manager.
He's been with us from the beginning.

Respectfully.
We all have our roots.

I believe in bands
holding on to their roots.

Those roots need to be augmented.

I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

I may enrage some
and enthrall others.

I don't really give a fuck.

Your manager here
needs a manager.

Example-- ifyou hadn't have run out
on your contract in Phoenix...

we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

Butyou left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

You effectively traveled a long way
to pay that promoter to electrocuteyou.

Okay, your damages have putyou
way in the hole for this tour.

Right now, you owe the record company
more than you've got.

Butyour record's selling.
There's money to be made.

So I brought a plane in. We could add
more shows to make up the difference.

Respectfully.
We travel by bus.

Doris is the soul ofthis band.

That bus has been our home since
we were theJeff Bebe band. No way.

Hey, man, I'd travel on a pogo stick
ifI thought we could make more money.

You could play more dates
with a plane.

Well, it's not about money. It's about
playing music and turning people on.

Clearly. Respectfully.

But on the distasteful subject
ofmoney...

just know thatyou're all
making it right now.

And it's all out there.

I'm just talking about
bringing it back here.

Why should we payyou for something
we can do ourselves?

Doyou know how to keep
from getting charged...

for the ice below the floorboards
at Chicago Stadium?

Doyou know how to do
a headlining tour?

Doyou know Claire Rothman
at the L.A. Forum?

Doyou know Bobby Cowan,
Danny Marcus, Lisa Robinson?

Doyou know Frank Barcelona?
This is Cleveland!

Where's Kid Leo?
Where is he?

Doyou know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

And as much as you may believe that
this is gonna last forever, it does not.

Your biggest fan right now--
your biggest fan--

soon they're gonna want
to go to college...

gonna want to buy some clothes...

spend that money
some otherway.

And you know what?

They'll tapeyour record
from a friend's copy.

You gotta take whatyou can,
when you can, whileyou can...

and you gotta do it now.

That's what the big boys do.

Because ifyou think MickJagger'll
still be out there...

trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly, sadly mistaken.

Yes, well, uh,
thankyou, Dennis.

We'll, uh, we'll think
about whatyou said.

Oh, no, you--you don't understand.
I'll think about it.

I'm not auditioning.

I came here to decide
whether I want to representyou.

So I'll stand outside
for a moment and...

think about
whether I want to stay.

It was a good show.

I miss him already.

I'm tellingyou, you're comingalongat
a very dangerous time forrockandroll.

The waris over.
They won...

andthey willruin rockandroll...

andstrangle everything
we loveaboutit.

Put them up.
All right.

I don't know what that was.
It was a donkey dick, man!

No matterwhereyou come from,
a donkey dick is funny.

It ain't funny, man.

Can I helpyou?
Is Russell Hammond here?

Hey, the Enemy!
Come on in, son.

Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

This game's been going on for twoyears.
Come on, find a spot.

This is Mick. He's with The Who.
Howyou doing?

This is Raymond. He's with the Eagles.
This is Reg. He's with Humble Pie.

I thinkyou know Red Dog.
Hey, brother!

We've been developing this system
ofpoker over theyears...

soyou can play it
in any condition, which helps.

We only let Russell in
because he brought the hash.

Easy, easy.
The press is here.

Don't mention me
orThe Eagles.

Well, I'm done.

Uh, I'm out.
Out. I'm out.

All right, I'm in.
All right, all right.

Side proposition to the winner.

For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

I'll throw into the pot
three lovely ladies...

including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

who have to leave the tour
before New York.

Is that okaywith you?
Russ is getting soft on us.

Is that okay?
Okay.

It's a deal.
Show 'em.

Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

Be good to 'em, Reg.
We oweyou $50 and a case of Heineken.

All right.

-Joint?
-You know how I know this is good stuff?

How's that?
This is from Crosby.

Is that the Crosbyweed?
Yeah, this is from Crosby.

Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.

Give me this.
Give me a light. I want fire.

Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

She already knows that Leslie's coming
to New York tomorrow.

Everybody understands.

This is the circus.
Everybody's trying not to go home.

Nobody's saying good-bye.
Would you like some?

I may.
How many?

Quit looking at me like that.

Happy, happybirthday
Happy, happybirthday

Happy, happybirthday
Happy, happybirthday

Happy, happybirthday
toyou

I'm making a wish.

So... Penny, our friend,
has gained anotheryear...

but long ago
she threw it in gear.

She rocked the South,
the East, the West.

Could we get off
this endless tour...

where we're Black Sabbath's
fucking special guest?

Yes!

She says she's retired...

but we've
heard that before.

She chose us.
In Penny Lane we trust.

She is a fan
ofthis band...

much more so than us.
Yeah!

Cut the cake
Let's go!

Who wants it?

Thankyou, baby.

Who wants the ''P''
in Penny?

Happy birthday.
Oh, thankyou.

I'm sorry
the plane isn't bigger.

Who didn't get cake?

Any extra plates? Anybody?

You thinkyoucan foolme.

I can read you.
I know whatyou're thinking.

What's that?
You're worried about me and Russell.

Yeah, I gotta work on that.

You're so sweet.

God, ifthere was more ofyou in him.

Don't tell me this stuff.
I wanna like him.

Did you miss a test or something?

You have no idea.
Look, I know I'm not on the plane.

I'm not going
on some other band's bus.

I could go with the Stillwater road crew
but that would be pathetic...

and the girls are all going
with Humble Pie.

So, ifyou could find out
from Russell--

Forget it.
I'm flying to New York myself.

I've got a bunch ofpartial tickets.
I know his ex-wife...

current-girlfriend thing
is gonna be there.

I'm not sure that's a good idea.

What areyou saying?
Did Russell say something?

I don't know anything.
Well, I know he wants me there.

Wake up!
Don't go to New York.

Why areyou yelling at me?
I thought we were going to Morocco.

There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

There's not even a Penny Lane.

I don't even know
your real name.

IfI ever met a man
in the real world...

who looked at me
the wayyoujust looked at me--

When and where
does this ''real world'' occur?

I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

and all these sayings and nicknames.

Honey, you're too sweet
for rock and roll.

Sweet? Where doyou get off?

Where doyou get sweet?

I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!.

And I could be very dangerous
to all ofyou.

I am not sweet!

And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

Look, you should be happy for me.

You don't know
what he says to me in private.

Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody--

Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case ofbeer?

I was there.

I was there!

Oh, God.

I'm sorry.

What kind ofbeer?

Welcome to New York!
It's okaytobenervous.

You should be nervous.
All you can do is beyourself...

and leave a pint ofblood
on that stage.

We showed you America.
We did everything but getyou laid.

No. Yeah?

I'm from the Church of Lenny. We bow
to his will and all it represents.

He's the king
ofthe king ofkings.

Can I get an autograph?
Who should I make it out to?

She's here.
Make it out to Lenny.

Russell, can I haveyour autograph?
Yeah.

Leslie!

Howyou doing?
-Jeffrey.

Room's fully stocked.
Air-conditioning's on.

And, by the way, you look stunning.
Thanks. Seeyou later.

All right, bags in five!

Cars leave for the party at 6:00.

There are lighter souvenirs, you know.

Well, I kept thinking
I was gonna go home the next day.

Yeah, so did I...
1 5 years ago.

That's the wrong bag,
you idiot!

William?
Vic.

It's all happening.
They're here.

and Keith Richards

came to the front ofthe stage,
and he pulled me out.

And they
took me backstage...

and gave me a Coke
with ice and a lemon.

And I neverwent home.

I've done twice the things
I said I did.

What aboutyour mom?

She always said, ''Marry up.

Marry someone grand.''

And that's why she named me ''Lady.''

She named you ''Lady''?

Lady Goodman.

Lady Goodman-- that's great.

Nowyou know all my secrets.
You've got me.

Hi, this is Craig, yourpilot.

Itappears we've caught the edge
ofthatelectricalstorm...

we were trying to outrun.
Oh, my God.

Electrical storm?
Sobuckle up tightnow.

We'regonna do ourbesthere.
Rock and roll.

We shouldn't be here.

Oh, my God!
Whoa, baby!

Doris, wemissyou!

All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

We found a field to land in.
A field?

I can't breathe, man.

It's gonna be kind ofa rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

Just hang in there,
and we'll getyou out ofthis.

Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

Hejust told us we're gonna die.
We're gonna die?

...Thywill be done on Earth--

I'm trying to maintain,
but the fucking thing won't--

Oh, my God!

Ifsomething should happen--
Maybe I never said this enough.

I love all ofyou.

I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit and run.

I hit him andjust kept on going.
I don't know ifhe's alive or dead...

but I'm sorry.

Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

Oh, my God!

Look, I loveyou all too.
You're like family to me.

Especially since Marna left me.
And listen, fellas...

I just wantyou to know, ifI took
an extra dollar or two here and there...

it's because I knew I'd earned it.

Yeah. I slept with Marna, Dick.
I did too.

I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

You slept withJeff?
Yeah, but it didn't count.

It was the summerwe decided
to be free ofall rules.

And you sayyou love me!

I don't loveyou, man.
I never did.

None ofus loveyou.

You act above us.
You always have.

Finally, the truth.

Youjust held it over us,
likeyou might leave.

Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

I had to live with you.

And now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair.

Please, enough!

And I'm still in love with you,
Leslie.

Oh, I don't wanna hear any more.
Shut up,Jeffrey!

It's all happening.
What the fuck!

Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead.
Don't be self-righteous, Russell.

Not now, man.

You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

last summer up until yesterday.

Why don'tyou tell Leslie that?

Shut up!
I quit!

I'm gonna kill you!
I quit!

''That groupie''?

She was a Band Aid.
All she did was loveyour band.

And you all used her.

All ofyou.
You used her and threw her away.

She almost died last night
whileyou were with Bob Dylan.

You guys, you're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

She was your biggest fan.

And you threw her away.

And ifyou can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

And I love her!
I love her!

Fuck it!

I'm-- I'm gay!

Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

We're out in the clear now.
Sweet relief!.

Sweet life!
Hallelujah, dear God!

We made it. We're alive.

Write whatyou want.

Just leaveyour package
on the desk.

Oh, I'm not a messenger.
I'm one ofyourwriters.

William H. Miller.

It'sjust a kid!

Go right on in.

You're William Miller?

Yep.
Oh, baby.

Didn't anything happen? I mean,
after $600 in room-service bills?

Didn'tyou get anything on tape
with Russell Hammond?

And where wereyou in this piece?
What did you wanna write?

Because this reads
like what theywanted you to write.

You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

Something must have happened.
Let's push up Flippo's Who cover.

Good, 'cause it's gonna take me
three days to get through this research.

It's all handwritten
on little bits ofpaper.

It's a puff-piece.
They refer to the women as ''chicks.''

-As a woman, I have a problem with that.
-You want 'em to likeyou.

I know it's a side issue.
It happens.

It's embarrassing.
Ben! You told me to send what I had.

It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

Oh, man, youmade friends with 'em.

See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

'cause theywantyou to get drunk
and feel likeyou belong.

Well, it was fun.

Because they makeyou feel cool.

And, hey, I metyou. You are not cool.
Iknow.

Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

Because we are uncool.

While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

most ofthe great art in the world
is about that very problem.

Good-looking people--
they got no spine.

Their art never lasts.

They get the girls,
but we're smarter.

Yeah, I can really see that now.
Yeah, 'causegreatartisabout...

you know, guilt and longing...

and, you know,
love disguised as sex...

and sex disguised as love.

Hey, let's faceit.
Yougotabigheadstart.

I'm glad you were home.

I'm always home.
I'm uncool.

Me too.
You're doinggreat, youknow?

The only true currency
in this bankrupt world...

is whatyou share with someone else
when you're uncool.

Listen, myadvice toyou--

andIknowyou think
theseguysareyour friends--

ifyou wanna be a true friend to them...

be honest and unmerciful.

''I'm flying high
overTupelo, Mississippi...

with America's hottest band...

and we're all about to die.''

Dark, lively.
Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

Did this all really happen?
I'll call and check the quotes.

Holy shit! I just got offthe phone
with RollingStone.

They called me too.
What's he using?

All-- he's using it all.
This, according to the ''fact-checker.''

So what?

''So what''?
We come offlike amateurs...

some average band trying to come
to grips with success...

jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

We're buffoons.

''Rock and roll can save the world''?

''The chicks are great''?
I sound like a dick.

You are a dick.
I never said that.

Maybe wejust don't see ourselves
the waywe really are.

Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

This kid has you on acid screaming,
''I'm a golden god'' from a fan's rooftop.

They used him to fuck us. They'll
probablyjust putyou on the cover.

Wait. I never said,
''I'm a golden god.''

Or did I?

We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.

I liked him as a person.

He was never a person.
He was ajournalist!

You! You had
the right idea all along!

How about the plane flight?
It's all there.

Don't worry.
It's unspecific who says what.

No names are mentioned
in the more embarrassing sequences.

It'sjust completely obvious
who's who, and we're fucked!

I told him he could write
what he wanted.

Hey, they haven't talked
to Russell yet.

You can always deny the key stuff
to the fact checker.

One phone call.
Then they can't print it.

Is that true?

This is war, my friend.

Ifyou'd have met me earlier,
he would have never been around.

He'll live.

Let's identify
the goals here.

T-shirts, foreign markets, renegotiating
your contract, merchandising.

Happiness.
Realizing your dreams.

Money. Cool.

Meeting the Beatles.

Let's put all ofit in the pot.

It all depends on mystique.

Not giving too much away.

I'm going to L.A. tonight.
Call me ifyou need me.

But before I go, let me
giveyou a lesson in mystique.

You can only have one.
Which one doyou want?

Which one
areyou gonna choose?

As long as you can't see
what's in this hand...

you'll always want it more.

It's phenomenal, William,
to be quite honest with you.

It's sophisticated, intelligent. We
only had to cut out a couple of'graphs.

Jeff Bebe's mother already sent over a
whole shoe box full ofchildhood photos.

She did?
But it's really gonna look fantastic.

The bandjust denied 90 percent
ofthe story. It's a fabrication.

You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

Russell Hammond is the one
who denied it.

Now wait a second.
Denied it.

We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

He'sjust some fan.
What doyou expect?

So, anyway, put those two pieces--

Ben. Wait.

You guys, this is my brother.

Nice to finally meetyou.
You have a good day.

You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

I think I'm needed.

I'll seeyou.

You look awful, but it's great.

You're living your life.

You're free of Mom.

Hey, I'll take offwork.

Let's have an adventure together--
you and me-- finally.

Anywhereyou wanna go,
anywhere in the world.

This is not my idea ofa good time.

-Just get me to my bed.
I'll deal with her.

I forgiveyou.

I didn't apologize.

I am out ofhere.

Hey, Sapphire.
Hey, boy.

I hate good-byes.
Me too.

All right,
so I didn't likeyou much.

Do we have to
like each other?

I sorta thought so.

I think it would have
worked against us. I really do.

You know what they say.

All the great partnerships
hated each other.

We didn't hate each other
that much, did we?

No, maybe not.
I could work on it, though.

I just can't
pictureyou with Leslie.

I'm theyou they get
when they can't getyou.

Sorry.
I got it. It's cool.

I'll seeyou later on.
All right, seeya.

All right.

Is Penny okay?

The Quaaludes incident?
Well, it wasn't pretty.

She could've died.

You know, I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

I guess I was wrong.
One ofthem ended up saving her life.

What doyou care? I mean,
we all know whatyou did to him.

I mean, everybody knows.

Even Penny Lane.

Something tells me
that 20 years from now...

we'll remember her...
and not much else.

Hey, Russell.

Can you believe these new girls?

None ofthem use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

You know, to truly love some silly
little piece ofmusic, or some band...

so much that it hurts.

It's Russell.
Don'thang up.

Ican'treally talk rightnow.
I'm inaroom fullofpeople.

Actually, I'm alone.

I won't call again, I promise.

ButIneedtoseeyouface to face...

because I'm neverasgood
as whenyou're there...

andIcanseemyself
the wayyoulookatme.

AndI'msorry. Ifwe couldjustget
togetherandfindsome time to talk.

Let's say all the things
we never said.

Givemeyouraddress.

I'm coming toyou...

this time.

Gotapen?

I'm Russell Hammond.

So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

Come in.

Is she home?
Who? Anita?

Where am I?
Hello?

You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

Oh, man.

My son is very important to me too...

and I do thinkyou owe him
an apology.

I appreciateyou showing up.
No, no, I agree...

ma'am.

There's hope foryou yet, Russell.

Well--

So this is...
where the Enemy sleeps.

You know, I thinkwe both wanted to--
to be with her.

And she wanted us to be together.

You should give her a call.

You both live in the same city.

You really think I should?
Yeah.

That girl really cares aboutyou.

Man, I never even knew her real name.

Oh, I called your magazine...

and told them the truth.

I don't know
what they're gonna do with it...

but I told them
everyword you wrote was true.

We are gonna do this one more time.

So, Russell...

what doyou love about music?

To begin with...

everything.

Tickets!
How much?

Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.
