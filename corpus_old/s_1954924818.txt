Honey, You Gonna Be In There All Night?
I'Ll Be Right Out.

I Can'T Believe
There'S No Television.

Oh, Don'T Be
Such A Grump.

I Think It'S Quaint.

Hey, Aren'T We
On The Top Floor?

Yeah, I Think.
That'S What I Thought.

It'S Just That
When I Was In The Bathroom,

I Heard This, Like,
Weird Creaking Noise.

It'S An Old House.

You'Re Right.

Mmm!

So, You Want To Go
Antiquing Tomorrow?

No, I Want To Go To
The Witch Museum.

The Witch Museum? Everyone
Goes To The Witch Museum.

I Know,
But When In Rome...

All Right, Witch
Museum It Is.

Thank You.

Anything
For My Baby.

But Now We Have
To Go To Sleep,

'Cause We Have To
Get Up Early.

Okay.

Good Night.
Good Night.

Dan, I See
You Found The Place.

Yes, And I Did Not
Get Lost This Time.

Gretchen, This Is
My Wife, Jessica.
Jessica, This Is Gretchen.

Nice To Finally
Meet You.
Hi.

This Is My Aunt Rose.
She'S The Current Owner.

Rose, This Is Dan
And Jessica Coffey.

They'Re Here To
See The House.

Hi. Your House
Is Lovely.

You'Ll Have To
Excuse My Aunt.

This Is Very Hard For Her--
Handing Over The Business
To Strangers.

I'M Sure
You Understand.
Of Course.

The House Is Over
350 Years Old.

It'S One Of The Oldest
In All Of New England,

Dating Back To
The Early Colonists.

It Needs Some Updating,

But That'S Part
Of The Charm.

Wow.

Great View.

Absolutely.

It'S Nice, Right?
Yeah.

We Have
A Main Residence

And Then Three Guest Rooms,
All Upstairs.

How Long Has It Been
A Bed-And-Breakfast?
40 Years.

My Aunt And Uncle
Converted It When
They First Bought It.

If You Don'T Mind Me Asking,
Why Are You Guys
Selling The Place?

He Died About A Year Ago,
A Heart Attack.
It Was Very Sudden.

She Tried To Keep The Place
Going On Her Own,

But It Was Just
Too Much For Her.

Did They Not Have A
Handyman Or Any Other Staff?

No, It Was Just
The Two Of Them.

My Uncle Was
The Fix-It Type.

Liked To Do Things
Himself.

So, What'S Gonna
Happen To Her?

Assisted Living.

We Found A Lovely Place
Just A Few Miles From Here.

I Have To Warn You,
The Upstairs Is
A Bit Of A Mess.

So What About All
This Furniture Here?

What Do You Guys Plan
On Doing With It?

It'S Included. It'D Be
Too Much Trouble To Move It.

And Besides,
It Belongs To The House.

So, What
Do You Think?

Can We Afford This?

Yes. We'Ll Be...
We'Ll Be Fine.

Are You...
I Promise.

Okay.
Let'S Do It.

Really?
Yeah,

If You Think
We Can Do This.
I Know We Can.

Okay.

I Love You.
I Love You, Too.

This Is Gonna
Be Great.

Okay. Well, I'Ll Go
Back To The Office
And Draw Up The Paperwork.

Pleasure Doing
Business With You.

Absolutely.
Thank You Very Much.

Congratulations.
Thanks.

I Know Running
A B & B Is Crazy,

But It'S Been Your
Dream Since As Long
As I'Ve Known You.

I Know. I Just...

Well, I Guess
It'S Our Dream Now.

I Am Completely
Okay With That.

Okay.
Next Time We
Drive Up Here,

It'S Gonna Be
Our Home.

Honey, Where Does
This One Go?

Uh, The Kitchen.

Kitchen. Okay.
Wylie, Come On, Boy.

Excellent.

Honey, I Got
The Phone Working.

You Want A
Gold Star Or Something?

Yes, Actually, I Would
Love A Gold Star.
Thank You.

All Right, Well,
Why Don'T You Order Us
Some Food On That Thing?

I'M Starving.

How Is It?
Okay.

Yeah?
Mm-Hmm.

Oh.

Mm. Mm-Hmm.

Did We Unpack
The Glasses?

Hm-Mmm.
Not Yet.

Okay.

This Is Gonna
Have To Do,

Madame.

Okay.

A Toast

To Our New Home
And Business.

Look At Us.

So Classy.

Okay, Well, Mine'S...
Do You Want To Know
My Lucky Numbers?

Yes. No. I Want To
Read You My Thing.
What Are Yours?

"Keep In Mind Your
Most Cherished Dreams

In The Future."

Oh, That'S
What We'Re Doing.
Yes.

And, Um, "To Catch A Cold"
Is

Huh?
Exactly.

Hey, Honey?

What Time Do You
Want To Wake Up
Tomorrow Morning?

Mm, Early.

Like, 6:00 A.M.

Okay.

Excellent.

We'Ll Have
Breakfast In Bed.

What Do You Want,
Pancakes Or Waffles?

Pancakes.

I'M So Tired.

Yeah? Long Day?

Yeah.

Hmm. Mm.

What?
What?

I'M Just Checking Out
My Gorgeous Wife'S

Incredibly Cute Ass.

Can We Do This
Tomorrow?

Tomorrow?

Don'T You Know
The Rules?
What?

You Have To Christen
Your New House
In Your New Bed,

Or It'S Incredibly
Bad Luck.

Rain Check?
          "Rain Check"?

Yeah,
I'M Tired.

Did You Pull
That Card On Me?

Okay, But Remind Me

To Oil The New Bed

For The Rain Check.

Sweaty Dreams, Baby.
"Sw-- Sweaty Dreams"?

Yes.

You Are Cruel.

You Love Me.
Yes, I Do.

Hi.
Hi.

I Forgot Where I Was
This Morning.

Don'T Worry About It.
It'Ll Take Some
Getting Used To.

So What'S First
On The Agenda?

Got Anything?

No.

All Right. Um...

How About That One?

Uh, No.

All Right, Then.

What About That One?

Oh, Yep.
That'S The Kitchen.

That... Is The Kitchen.
All Right.

This One Is

A Bit Of A Mystery.

Okay, So I'M All Done.

Cool. Can You Help Me
With Some Of These Boxes?

Maybe.
Come On.

Dan?

Are You Down Here?

Babe?

Oh, Hey.

What Is All This?

Uh, I Don'T Know.

Some Kind Of Storeroom,
I Guess.

Oh.

Oh, Weird.
Look At This Chair.
I Know.

At Least, I Think
It'S A Chair.
What Is That?

I Don'T Know,
But I Wouldn'T Go
Touching It If I Were You.

That'S Pretty Nasty.

Why Does It Have
Straps On It?

I Don'T Know.
You Tell Me.

I Don'T Know Why
There'S A Strap On It.

I Don'T Know.

You'Re The Smart One.

So Much For
That Rain Check.

Good Night, Hot Stuff.

I Have To Feed Them.

I'M Waiting For You.

Dan! Dan. Dan.

Dan, Wake Up!

Oh, Dear.
I Woke You.

No, I-I Don'T Know
How She Got In.

That'S The Point.
We Woke Up, And She Was
In Our Bedroom.

Yeah, Okay.
No, No, No, No, No.

What?
I'Ll Call Them.

The Children.

Take Care
Of The Children.

My Norman.

My Sweet,
Sweet Norman.

This Way, Mrs. Stanton.

Such A Nice Girl.

Too Bad.
I'M Very Sorry
About This.

Apparently,
She Just Walked Out.

So She Made It
All The Way Here.

Well, This Is
What She Knows.

This Place,
It'S What
She Remembers.

She Must'Ve Walked
Through The Woods.

Without Any Shoes?
How Far Is That?

Um, They Always
Kept A Spare
Hidden Outside.

That'S How
She Got In.

You Might Want To
Change The Locks,

All The Same.

Gretchen Said She Didn'T
Even Have Any Kids.

That Just Doesn'T Make
Any Sense. Then What Was
She Talking About?

Babe, She'S Confused.

She'S Old.

I Don'T Know. I Feel Like We'Re
Somehow Taking Advantage Of
Her Or Something.

Are You Kidding Me?
You Saw Her.

She Didn'T Even Know
Where She Was.

If It Wasn'T Us That Came
And Snatched Up This Place,

It Would'Ve Been
Somebody Else.

At Least
We'Re Good People.

Give Me One Sec.

Okay.

Hello?

So That Was Roger.

He Wants Me To
Fly Out To Chicago.

But I Thought I Had You
For The Next Week.

I'M Sorry. Apparently
There'S Some Client
I'M Supposed To Meet.

It'S Really Important.

Okay.

Sorry.

Hey, Babe,
I'M Heading Into Town
For Some Supplies.

You Need Anything?
Nope. I'M Good.

Okay. I Guess
I'Ll See You In A Bit.
All Right.

Where Did You Get
That Weirdo Book?

It'S Not A Weirdo Book.

I Got It
At The Library.

You Know,

That Big Building
In Town

With All The Books
In It.

Right, Right, Right.
That Place

With The Words
On Paper.

Yeah.
Oh.

Anyway, So Why Are
You Reading It?

I Don'T Know.

Thought I'D Try
To Brush Up On
The Region'S History.

Mm.
You Know,
Just In Case

Our Guests Ask.

That'S Very Smart.

Oh. Oh, Babe, Look,
It'S Our House.

It Says Here That
The Man Who Built It
In 1665,

Arthur March,
Was A Carriage Maker.

Hence The Name.

That'S Clever.

You Are Such A Dork!
I Know.

Oh, His Wife, Lydia,
Was A Midwife

To The Early Colonists.

Hmm.

That'S Kind Of Cool.

Oh, Babe,
Listen To This.
Look.

"When A Mysterious
Illness

"Plagued The Colony'S
Children,

"Lydia Was Blamed
For It

"And Accused Of
Practicing Witchcraft.

She Was Tried
And Hanged In 1669."

Can You
Believe That?

Some Kids Get The Flu,
And Immediately It'S
A Woman'S Fault.

What?

Just, I Love
My Little Feminist.

Well...
So Cute.

Yeah, Just...
It'S A Little
Frustrating.

I Love You.
I Love You.

Hurry Back, Okay?
I Will.

Bye, Wylie.
See You Later.

Wylie? Wylie?
You Want To Go For A Walk?

All Right.
All Right.

Come On! Come On!
Yeah!

Wylie?

Wylie, Come On, Boy.

Hey, What'S Up?

Is This Your Dog?
Yeah.

What'S His Name?

Wylie.

Hey, You'Re The New Owner
Of That Inn, Right?

You Mean
The Carriage House?

Yeah, The Old
Witch'S Place.

You, Uh, Want One?
Uh, No, Thanks.

I Don'T Smoke.

Hey, Listen,
I'Ve Got To Get Back.

My Husband'S Going To
Start To Worry.

You Want To Let Go
Of My Dog?

Sure Thing.

Thanks.

Come On.

See You Around.

Wylie, Come On.

Wylie, Come On.
Let'S Go To Bed.

Wylie? Wylie.

Hey, Come On.

Wylie, Get Away
From There.

Weird.

Hello?

Hello?

<I> Are You Sure? </I>
Yes, Dan, I'M Sure It Rang,

But It Said
It Was Coming From
The East Room.

<I> That'S Weird. It'S Probably</I>
<I> Just Something Wrong</I>
<I> With The Wiring.</I>

<I> I'Ll Check It</I>
<I> When I Get Home.</I>

Okay, Yeah. I Guess
I'M Just Being Silly.

<I> Hey, I Got To Go,</I>
<I> But I'Ll See You</I>
<I> Tomorrow, Okay?</I>

Okay. Bye.

Damn.

Norman, You Dirty
Old Man.

Jess?

Sweetie,
You In There?

Honey?

Hey, I'M Home.

Hey, There.

You Want Some Company?

No, No, No, No.
I Didn'T Want You
To Turn It Off.

I Just Wanted
To Let You Know
I Was Home.

Okay.

Hey, Is Something Wrong?

I'M Fine.

I'M Fine.

Okay.

You Made Quite The Dent
Here Today, Babe.

Yeah.

I'Ve Been Busy.

I Can See That.

Tried Calling You.

Oh?

I Didn'T Hear
The Phone Ring.

I Was A Little Worried.

Hey,

Is Everything Okay?

Yeah.

I'M Just Tired.

I Haven'T Been
Sleeping Too Well.

,i Missed You.

I Missed You, Too.

Hey.

Where Were You?

Bathroom.

Mm.
You'Re So Cold.

Smells Good.

Wylie.
Hey, Buddy.

You All Right?

Hey, Is Something
Wrong With Him?

He Looks Spooked.
Wylie.

No, I Don'T Know.

Honey...

Have You Been
Beating Our Dog
While I'Ve Been Away?

You Have, Right?

No, I Would Never
Do That.

I'M Just Kidding,
Jesus.

What'S... Were You Doing
A Little, Like, Gardening
Before Breakfast?

Oh, I Forgot
To Mention That

There'S Something Wrong
With The Washing Machine.

It'S Flooded.

Okay. I'Ll Take
A Look At It.

Hey, Jess, Have You
Seen My Hammer?

Jess?

Hey, Jess,
You In There?

Jess?

What The Hell
Is That Locked For?

Um...
You Didn'T Hear Me

A Few Minutes Ago,
Trying To Get In?

No.
What Are You
Doing In There?

Nothing.
Just Straightening Up.

You'Re Straightening Up
With The Door Locked?

I Heard Whispering
In There.

Babe, Who Are
You Talking To?

No One.

Think A Raccoon
Just Tried To
Jack Our Car.

Wylie?
        Wylie, Come On.

We'Re Going
Upstairs, Buddy.
Hey. Upstairs.

Wylie, Come On.
Upstairs.

Come On.

Come On.

So... I Was
Just Wondering,

Um, What Happened
To Your Shirt.

I Tore It
On A Nail.

You... You Tore It
On A Nail, So You
Threw It Out?

I Ended Up Using It
As A Rag.

As A Rag?
You Loved That Shirt.

You Got It
On Our Honeymoon.
It Got Old.

Hey, It'S Me.

I Mean, She'S Been Acting
A Little Weird Lately.

Moody Or Something.

Yeah, That'S
Very Funny. No.

You Can... Yeah,
You Can Go Ahead
And Tell Her That,

Because I'M Not Gonna.

Can You... Can You
Hang On A Second?

Oh, You Have Got
To Be Kidding Me.

Hey, Can I
Call You Back?

Damn It!

What The Hell?

Oh, Jesus.

"Live Feed"?

Huh.

My God.

These Cameras Are
Still Working.

What The Hell?

Oh, Hey.
You'Re Awake.

Uh, I'M Gonna Run To
The Store, And I'Ve
Got To Fix The Roof.

You Gonna Be Okay?

I'M Fine.

Okay.
All Right, See You.

You Sure
About This?

The Suv Is Gone.
I Saw Him Pull Out.

What About
The Dog?

Really, Dude?

Keep A Lookout.

Stay Here.

Dylan?

Dylan?

Eric?

Come On, Guys,
This Isn'T Funny.

They'Re Still Here.

Hey, Honey,
Just Want To Let You
Know I'M Home.

What Do We Have Here?

Unbelievable.

"October 27th, 1998."

"October 27th, 1998."

What'S The Matter?

What Do You Think About

Getting Out Of Here
For A Few Days?
When?

I Don'T Know.
How About Tomorrow?

We Still Have
A Lot Of Stuff
Left To Do Here.

I Know, And We'Ve Been
Working Really Hard,
Especially You,

With The Unpacking
And The Renovations.

I Just Think
It Would Be Cool

If We Just Took Off

And, Uh, Cleared
Our Heads.

I Just Think
You'Ve Been Working
Really Hard,

And You Deserve...

I'M Not Going Anywhere
Until We'Re Finished Here.

Dan?

Where Have You Been?

On A Walk.

Did You Sleep In Here
Last Night?

You Were Snoring.

What... What'S
The Matter With You?

Nothing.

Look, I Don'T Know
What I Did

To Make You So Mad
And Distant.

Okay, Maybe It Was
My Trip To Chicago

When I Was Supposed
To Be Here For You,
I Don'T Know.

I'M Not Mad.

"Record."

Hi. Mrs. Stanton?

If You Can Just
Sign In Here,

And She'S In Room 119,
On The Left.

Mrs. Stanton,
Do You Remember Me?

Uh...

My Wife And I, We Bought
The Carriage House.

We'Re The New Owners.

Uh, Mrs. Stanton,
The Other Night

You Mentioned
Something To My Wife

About The Children.

Did I?

You Don'T...
You Don'T Remember That?

Uh, Did Your...

Did Your Husband Ever
Mention Seeing Anything?

You Leave My Norman
Out Of This.

My Husband Was
A Good Man!

I'M Sure He Was.
I Just...

I Need To Know If

He, Uh, Saw
Anything Unusual.

That Room...

It Was Supposed To Be
A Nursery.

What Room?

The East Guest Room.

Only, The Wife
Couldn'T Have Children.

But That Didn'T Stop Her.

Wait A Minute.

I Remember You.

Those Children,

The Ones You'Ve Seen?

I Didn'T Mention
Anything About...

They Need To Be Fed.

They Should Have
Burned Her.

Hanging'S Not Enough.

You Need To Burn Her
Before It'S Too Late!

I'M Sorry I'Ve Been
Acting So Strange Lately.

It'S Just This House.

That'S...
Totally Fine.

It'S Okay.

Where Are You?

I Know You'Re There.

What Are You
Waiting For?

Jess?

Let'S See What
You'Ve Been Up To.

Where'D You Go?

There You Are.

What Are You Doing?

Hello?

An... Anyone There?

Hey.

You Out For
Another Walk?

Yep.

Are You All Right?

No, I'M Not All Right.

I Have A Headache.

I'M Definitely
Coming Down
With Something.

Where'S Wylie?

Don'T Know.

You Didn'T Take Him
Out With You When
You Went For A Walk?

Nope.
He Wouldn'T Come.

You Said It Yourself--

He'S Been Acting Strange.

Oh, He'S Been
Acting Strange?

Wylie?

Hey, Boy!

Wyles!

Come On! Come On!

I'M Sure He'S Just
Out For A Walk.

Hey, Um,
I'M Just Wondering,

Were You Burning
Something In The Kitchen
Earlier This Morning?

It'S Just
Some Incense.

"Incense."
Okay, Um, Can You
Do Me A Favor

And Not Do That Again?
Because It Smells Like Shit.

Just Great.

What Are You Doing?
Jesus!

What Are<I> You</I> Doing?

I Heard A
Sound Up Here.

I Was Just
Investigating.

Just Go To Bed.

Jess?

Jessica?

Jess?

Man, Where
The Hell Is She?

Jess?

Jess, You Down Here?

Jess?

What Have You
Done To Me?

Let Me Out
Of This Thing.

Jess...

There'S An Evil
Inside You, Dan.

But Don'T Worry.

We'Ll Get It Out.

Jess, Wait.
Just Listen, Okay?

Stop It. Jess, Jesus!

Jess, Hey, Stop.

Please Stop!

Stay With Me.

You'Re Crazy!
You'Re Crazy.

I Wasn'T Expecting You
So Soon.

Traffic Was Quicker
Than We Had Expected.
Ah.

Hi.

Hi.

I Have The Perfect
Room For You.

It'S The East Room,
Upstairs And To The Left.

Thanks.

Enjoy Your Stay.
