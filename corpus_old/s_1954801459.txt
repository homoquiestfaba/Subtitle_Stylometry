Is it okay if I do this the whole time?

Is it okay if I do this?

Um, being naked is like...

Being naked is really fun.

It can be, like, super weird.

Yeah.

I wish we were both naked right now.

Listen up, ladies.

It's "Girl Code."

On this episode of "Girl Code"...

It's that voice in the back

of your head that makes you

feel bad about eating all of the ice cream.

Guilt.

Also, just because we hear you

doesn't mean we're paying attention.

We're learning how to listen.

Then, our code qualifiers

take your issues to task on Ask Girl Code.

I hate to make it gross,

but let's talk about
sometimes when you fart

and you're sitting down,
it goes up, kind of

in the front, like, ooh.

That's kinda fun.

That's the worst.

But first...

We were born like this, but it's

usually hard to feel flawless

when it comes to being naked.

I love being naked.

My best friend Katrina, because

we live in a studio, hates it,

'cause I always walk around naked,

and I'll throw, like, a right

titty in her face.

Just 'cause.

I'd like to wear as little

amount of clothing as possible.

If I could get away with just,

like, wearing a little denim

strip over my labia,
that's what I would do.

I love being naked.

I feel like... I mean,
everybody has a body,

so... You know, it's nothing,

it's just like skin and some body parts.

I like being naked, it's totally cool.

I mean, (bleep), are you asking

me to get naked?

Let's do this (bleep).

Do you have another question?

Well, being naked as a kid

means bathtime, and then being

naked as an adult means sexytime,

which needs a bath afterwards.

I remember my brother,

my twin brother and I would take

baths together and then we would

go naked and jump on the bed

and we would sing the song,

"You have a penis, I have a vagina,"

and his was, "You have a vagina,

I have a penis,"

but we probably mixed it up

and that's where I got all these

gender issues.

My sister saw my dad naked

and said, I want one of those.

His (bleep).

Is she a lesbian, too?

No, we don't want (bleep)

That's not what being a lesbian means.

Well... I feel like I'm teaching

a lot by sitting next to you.

Great.

This is what a gay person looks like.

Being naked in a gym

locker room blows my mind.

There are women who are...

It's, like, always the older

women, and they're having full

conversations, fully naked,

bush just rocking out,

and they're like, oh, Joan,

how are the kids?

And she's like, well, Antonio

is now in law school.

Great.

My Morton, he's in law school.

It's like, your bush is out!

It seems like the people who

go to the gym are looking to

just, like, creep up and, like,

pick up their legs and, like,

give you a zoom all the way into

their uterus, and I'm like,

please don't, like, I don't want

to know you like that.

Everybody has imperfections
with their body,

everybody has, like, a certain

way that they are,

so you just gotta learn to

accept that and love that,

because chances are, the girl

that you're sitting in

the locker room with and she's

looking at you naked, she feels

a way about her body, too.

If you think you have a (bleep) weird body,

but you are just, like, have no problem

showing it, no one is gonna say (bleep)

to you, and if they do and you tell

them to (bleep) off, like,

you just won high school.

I feel like girls should be

the ones who want to get naked

more than men because girls'

bodies are, like, look like

works of art where my body just

looks like a bag of trash.

Right before I see a guy

naked, I'm just like, I want

see his (bleep), I want to s

his (bleep), oh, my God, oh, my

God, oh, my God, I'm gonna s his (bleep).

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

Oh, my God, that's his (bleep).

And then that's it, after that,

it's just like, yeah, okay.

I mean, I've definitely

unwrapped a present that

I wanted to return the next day

if you know what I mean.

When you're getting naked
in front of a guy,

I don't think you should do

lights on or lights off.

I think you go somewhere in the middle.

I call it cellu-lighting.

I'm most insecure about my

thighs when I'm naked, 'cause

they look like lava is just

spreading out, 'cause there's so

many divots and, like, holes and...

It's like very jiggly

and they're moving around a lot.

My thighs move when I'm not even breathing.

When are you not breathing?

When I do a test to see if my

thighs will still move.

I feel like fat girls get

real self-conscious about being

naked and they shouldn't!

Because it's more cushion for

the pushin', and some guys like fat women.

Light a candle, that's

perfect, everyone looks good in a candle.

But remember to blow it out,

because you're gonna burn yo


You don't want to die
with t mother (bleep).

It's the first time you (bleep) him.

If you feel uncomfortable

being naked, I always tell

people to get a spray tan

because it makes you look more

fit and less dead.

I gotta get one.

Some people need to be in

shape in order to be comfortable

being naked, and some people don't.

Some people are just happy

with their flabby flabs.

You know?

Like most men.

Coming up, it's the guilt

that keeps on giving.

Society loves to make women

feel guilty, like, that's kind

of the game, is, like, women

should be guilty for being women.

We're kind of born guilty, We're like, oh,

you're not a man?

What's up with that?

â™ªâ™ª

I want to be in charge of the money.

You're not allowed.

Why not?

Because, you're a woman.

It says right here women can't

be in charge of money.

What's this game called again?

It's Manopoly, the new board

game that's so much like real

life, it's almost not a game at all.

Oh, I passed yes.

$300, please.

Me too!

Pay me.

You only get $230.

Why?

Manopoly.

Fun for the whole family,

as long as they're all men.

Yes.

No, no, no.

You gotta pick a secretary card.

But, what if I wanna be an executive?

Don't be silly.

Manopoly.

You can be pretty or smart, but not both.

Yes, River Canyon!

I'm gonna buy it.

Not without your husband or your dad.

What?

I'm sorry, who invented this game?

There's something for everyone.

What's period jail?

Oh, I landed on the smile space!

I get to tell you to smile

and if you don't, you need to go

back to start while I yell at you.

What?

Smile!

Your boss finds you too attractive.

$10 fine.

Great, well, there's the rest of my money.

It is impossible to win this.

Manopoly.

It's just life, so quit complaining

and have fun with it.

Boom!

The cards may be stacked

against you, so we should all

know how to play up the guilt.

Guilt is when you do

something and you're like, oh!

I feel in my heart that I don't feel good.

I feel guilty.

It's almost like you ate too much cheese,

but it's not actual
cheese, it's just, like,

emotional cheese, you're just like, oh!

You just have, like, chills,

just guilty cheese chills.

That's guilt.

I feel guilty because I was

late to work today.

Sorry.

Society loves to make women feel guilty.

That's kind of the game,

it's, like, women should be

guilty for being women.

We're kind of born guilty, we're

like, oh, you're not a man?

What's up with that?

I feel like girls do guilt themselves.


was, like, cheating on
his girlfriend, like,

left and right,

and then she found out and she's

like, it's my fault.

I'm just like, what?

I was like, look, I'm not one to

break like any type of code,

but I was like, it's really not.

Women feel that all the time.

Girls be guiltin'
themselves on the regular.

Women be shopping and guilting

themselves afterwards.

You guys give guilt and feel

guilt for everything.

You ever seen a woman
try and eat a cupcake?

I've never felt so much stress

in my entire life.

I never make myself feel

guilty about (bleep),

even if I'm, like, trying to

diet, which is never, but if I do,

I'm like, oh, I just messed

it all up, I have to start all

over again, I feel so guilty.

I don't... No.

I wanted that (bleep) donut,

I ate the donut, I (bleep) and I feel good.

Some people are vegan because

they feel guilty about animals.

I'm all like, kill 'em.


Just kill 'em.

Did my parents ever make me feel guilty?

Does a bear (bleep) in the woods

and wipe his ass with a rabbit?

Yes.

I was brought up in a conservative home.

So... (sighing)

We can't do nothing.

They would say things like, Awkwafina,

did you know that if you
were born in China,

that you would be putting in the hairs

of the Barbie doll?


With two little chopsticks?

Moms were created just to guilt us.

They're guilting machines.

Like, my mom, I feel like, would

be happy, if I would crawl back

into her uterus.

Like, I feel like on a daily

basis, she's guilting me for

just being outside of her uterus.

You know, when people gui

you, they never just say wha

they want you to do.

Mm-hmm.

They'll just be like, it

would be really nice...

If you could find the time.

If you could just find th

time to call your grandma today.

I mean, she's alone in that house.

It's like, who's gonna be like,

oh, no thanks.

Hi, sweetie.

Um... Just calling because I haven't

heard our voice in a while

and I miss my baby.

Okay, bye.

Rip my heart in half, I feel so

guilty, I'm sorry, Mommy, please

still love me.

I have a couple of friends

who like to guilt me for things

that aren't my fault,

they're like, I was so lonely this weekend.

And I'm like, oh, that's weird,

you didn't text me,

so I couldn't read your mind.

Like, if a friend's guilting

you all the time, be like,

listen, Quinn, I'm not gay.

If I was, I would like you.

I would like you.

But, like, but don't you wanna be gay?

But don't you want to be gay

I want to be gay, but it's not a choice.

Be gay.

It's not a choice.

It is a choice for you.

It's something you're born with.

I'll choose for you, you're gay.

The biggest guilt that everyone gets...

Come on, let's go out.

No, let's go.

You're not gonna stay home, let's go out.

You'll meet somebody.

Guilt from your friends can

be good, 'cause it can really

keep you out of trouble, like,

if your friends see you doing,

like, some self-destructive

behavior, like, it's like, dude,

every time I talk to you, you're hungover.

Maybe you should stop drinking so much.

That's cool guilt.

That's guilt that'll keep you

healthy and alive.

I don't use guilt to, like, help people.

I use guilt to be like, do you

remember that time when you made

me feel not nice?

Will you please buy me
a cocktail right now?

Thank you, that made it feel

a little bit better.

I don't like resorting to

guilt in a relationship to make

the person do what I want, but I

am a big believer of the motto,

pout and you shall receive.

Ahh... I've used guilt to get what

I want in a relationship and I

will tell you the number-one

thing I want in a relationship,

and that's a mother (bleep)

massage.

I think you should save it

for the big stuff, and not the,

you know, oh, you left the towel

on the floor, oh, you did this.

I think you should save it for the,

did you just like ten of this

bitch's pictures in a row at

3:00 in the morning and I saw you?

You don't want to guilt them

into, like, texting you, or

telling you who they were with or why,

or taking you out or, like,

having sex with you, which is,

like, the craziest thing ever.

If you're guilting someone into

having sex with you, that is insane.

Dump that mother (bleep) and

delete his number out your phone.

Coming up, just because we

hear you, doesn't mean we're listening.

Girls talk a lot, like,

I have to listen to a lot of (bleep).

Yeah, yeah.

I think it's harder for you,

'cause you have to, like, list to a girl.

If I had to listen to a girl all

the time, I'd be like, blech,

I'm not a lesbian anymore.
Yeah.

Let's all take a minute to

bow down to Kathryn Bigelow.

She's a kick-ass director,

producer and screenwriter.

And she's the first woman to win

an Academy Award for best
director for her movie, "The Hurt Locker."

And in that same year, she beat

her ex-husband in the same category,

so the next time that you feel

like the odds are against you,

just remember that Kathryn Bigelow

paved the way for women in film

and she beat her ex in the process,

so let's all take a minute

to bow down to Kathryn Bigelow.

Welcome back to "Girl Code."

Whether you're the talker or the talkee,

you can save everyone a lot of

trouble if you're actually listening.

â™ª Listening is... â™ª

â™ª Listening... â™ª

Hold on.

â™ª Listening â™ª

â™ª To you and your questions â™ªâ™ª

Listening is so important,

like, you need to be a good

listener to be a good friend,

to be a good girlfriend, boyfriend.

To be good in anything,

you have to just shut up and listen.

Sorry, what?

Stupid joke?

Okay.

That's me not listening.

That's the joke.

I hate myself.

Listening and hearing are

definitely completely different things.

Listening is when you're

actually trying to understand,

like, what the person is trying

to communicate, like, not just

what they're saying,

but how they're saying it.

Do they want something from you?

Are they, like, expressing an emotion?

And hearing is just, like, oh, sounds.

Cool!

I love sounds.

I think a good listener is

somebody that makes you know

that they're paying attention to

you and they're really, really

understand what you're saying

and they're not being
creepy and just, like,

staring at you in a very,

like, lesbian type... I'm kidding.

I'm a great listener, sometimes.

Other times, people talk and I'm like...

Uh-oh.

They're gonna stop and I'm gonna

have to respond.

The best listeners are super

patient, usually easygoing,

usually have very low standards of friends.

Lonely.

So basically, losers are good

listeners, because, really, how

else are you gonna get popular?

I think to be a good

listener, you have to...

You can be a good listener.

You have to want to have with that person.

Yes, for sure.

That's it.

Yes, 100%.

100%, you're right.

You won.

A good way to see if

someone's listening to
you is just ask them,

are you listening?

So you just go, are you listening to me?

And then if they, like, get

a little startled, they were not

listening to you in the slightest.

I don't know if you're listening

to me, 'cause I talked about how

stupid girls look in heels

sometimes and you guys still look stupid.

Why'd you leave the house
looking like that?

You look like a dinosaur stomping around.

All of a sudden, your arms are
like this and you gotta move

like that just to get across the street.
You look stupid.

One of my biggest pet peeves

is when somebody's talking to

you and then they're looking

beyond you for someone better.

Like, what, am I not good enough?

My cable TV credits aren't good

enough for you?

If you say anything to me and I go..

"That's a good idea."

I'm not listening.

I didn't listen to a thing you just said.

"That's crazy,"

and "oh, for real?"

That's how I know you're not listening.

89.9% of the time, it's your

fault someone is not listening to you.

You are boring as (bleep).

And you are talking about

yourself or your stupid boyfriend too much

and then people just go, uh-huh,

yeah, okay, sure.

Filing nails and whatnot,

so don't be boring.

Fake listening is actually

very important to a relationship

because a lot of times, we don't

really want someone to listen,

we just want someone to hear.

When I'm fake listening,

you can tell, 'cause this

is what I look like.

Just try to be as normal as possible.

Just try and, like,

strip it... like, just...

just stop doing stuff.

All right.

You're obviously not listening to me, now.

I wish somebody would giv

advice, how to be a good

listener in a relationship.

My boyfriend listens to

everything I say and all I do,

is, like, ignore, ignore, ignore.

I think being a good listener

is just one of those
things that comes along

when you're invested.

When you're invested in

something, you wanna do

everything that you can do

to get a great return.

I'm a good listener in my relationships.

Liar.

I am.

My boyfriend doesn't talk a lot.

That's why.

Girls talk a lot.

Like, I have to listen to a lot of (bleep).

Yeah, yeah.

I think it's harder for you

'cause you have to, like, listen

to a girl, like, if I had to

listen to a girl all the time,

I would be like, blech,

I'm not a lesbian anymore.

If you want a guy to listen to you,

here's what you have to do.

Go to another room, get an XBox Live,

put on the headset and talk to

him while he's playing.

Fight levels together, and in

the meantime, you can talk about

how terrible your boss is.

Now I'll listen to you.

Someone stole your Lean Cuisine?

That's terrible.

Now shoot that guy.

Oh, you could totally make your boyfriend

a better listener.

Just, you gotta stop (bleep) him.

You got to.

Be like, wait, I told you

earlier what to get from the store.

Were you not listening?

Well, you know, I forgot.

Oh, you forgot?

Well, I forgot to (bleep) you tonight.

It's gonna be funny.

It's gonna be funny

after a month when I forgot

to (bleep) you every day.

Real quick.

They get into shape real fast,

trust me, use it.

Coming up... Things get a little bunched up

on Ask Girl Code.

I'm always camel toe-ing,
always, I love it.

Wait, you also have a big vagina, then?

Yeah, big chubby labia.

Yeah.

It just always looks hungry for fabric,

whenever I wear pants.

It's like... (vocalizing)

Munch it up.

It's normal to, like,

wipe your butt after you poop

and then just want to, like,

inspect it a little bit, right?

Like, not touching it, just,

like, looking at it?

Asking for a friend.

Welcome back to "Girl Code."

If at first you don't succeed,

you can try, try again.

Or just Ask Girl Code.

Dangerous_Love5 asks, is it a crime

if I run around town without a bra?

No way.

No, no way.

Oh, my gosh.

Let 'em be free.

Yeah.

Let them titties out.

Do you know how much happ

we'd all be as women if we all

never wore bras?

Yeah, bras were never invented.

'Cause you know who they invented for.

It was not for us.

It was... Why?

'Cause they were distressing, or...?

It was, like, a corset-y

thing for beer maidens.

Like, if you watch, like,

"Game of Thrones," or whatever,

they're always, like, serving

meat and stuff, and they've got,

like, their tits up here.

"Game of Thrones"

isn't legit.

The girls have, like...

They don't have even bushes

on "Game of Thrones."

Well, when's the last time

you just didn't wear a bra?

Like, what's happening?

I always have on a bra.

I have issues with, like,

the slope of my boob and I always

want them under my chin.

Me too, me too!

I sleep in a bra.

I slept in a bra until, like,

college, and then I was just, like, okay,

this is what they do.

When they're big, it's not

comfortable having not a bra...

They literally flop around.

It could get caught under things.

Yes.

Yes.

It's why I wear underwear 'cause I just...

I have that problem too.

I got a big vagina too.

I'm always camel toe-ing,
always, I love it.

Wait, you also have a big vagina, then?

Yeah, big chubby labia.

Yeah.

It just always looks hung for fabric

whenever I wear pants.

It's like... (vocalizing)

Munch it up.

@_ghost_gurl asked,

is it okay to change yourself

when nobody at school / work likes you?

Oh... No, you shouldn't change yourself.

You should just find people

who like you for who you are.

Yeah, right?

I feel like... I'm a weirdo.

I found you guys.

Yeah.

It sounds like _ghost_gurl

is in a (bleep) work / school

situation, which we've all been in.

I've gone to schools where

people hated me, I've worked at

jobs where everybody hated me,

but I know that changing myself,

like, to please those people

would not have made me into

a person I like, you know?

Yeah, totally, 'cause when

you're at school or at work,

you don't really choose the people

you're surrounded by.

Exactly.

So you get stuck with a lot

of, like, randos, and you have

nothing in common and then of

course they don't like you, 'cause, like,

you like weird stuff.

Yeah.

Yeah, like I didn't reall

have a lot of friends
until I found theater.

Right.

@helloiamname asks, is it

weird that I like it when my

booty muscles are twitching

after I work out?

Yeah, so weird.

I don't know what she's talking...

I've never had a butt twitch.

Oh, really?

Well, I don't work out, but

sometimes when I walk and move

my body, my muscles are like,

oh, don't do that, you don't use

those enough, and then I get,

like, leg twitches and butt twitches.

But what's... How is it twitching?

Is it going, like...


in the "7/11" video and it's just,

moving on its own?

Like, can you see the twitch?

I bet it's an internal feeling.

I hate to make it gross, but

let's talk about sometimes when

you fart and you're sitting

down, it goes up.

Kind of in the front, like, ooh.

That's kind of fun.

That's the worst.
