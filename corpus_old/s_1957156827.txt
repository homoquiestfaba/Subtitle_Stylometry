[â™ª]

[water lapping]

[waves crashing]

[indistinct chatter]

[blender whirring]


And this is for you.

All right. Thank you.

Uh-huh.

See you guys.

Gotta go, buddy.

See you later. [kisses]

See you.

Bye, honey.

-Love you. -[Mary] Love you.

[children chatter indistinctly]


-Are we ready? -Yeah.

[imitates explosion]

Have a great day, baby!

Bye!

And you, my darling.

[Mary purrs]

-Kioki. Hi. -[laughs] Mary.

So nice to see you.

Dazzling as ever.

I brought my new associate,

-Darlene. -Hi.

You guys have a seat

and I will get us something to drink.

Looks like you're keeping busy.


I mean, between the school committees

and then the twins' schedule,

it's just... it gets so hectic.

I don't know how I ever worked.


Delirium, as you know,
is still our best-selling series.

So, you want to do a
spinoff and hire a ghost writer.

You know how I feel about this. Go ahead.

actually, along those lines,

-we're stuck. -We're struggling, Mary.

The publishing landscape has changed.

We're going through a massive transition,

and could really use your help.

What? Wh-What is this?


One I think...

The numbers, they make sense.

One more book in the series
and we can make it over the edge.

Get through the transition... -Stop,
stop, stop right now.

Uh, this is not what I thought
we were meeting about.

You mislead me, Kioki.

I thought this was
something totally different.

Mary, I'm just trying to...

You've been through this before,

you're gonna find a way out,

I know you will.

-Okay? -[Kioki] Mary...

Mary, I assure you, we...

[Mary sighs]

[thunder rumbling]


Your check will continue
to arrive every quarter.

Thank you.


not to have to worry about your children,

whether or not they'll
have a roof over their head

or a good school to attend.

You're Mary Morrison, best-selling author.

Yet there was a time when Mary

couldn't even get one
publisher to read her work.

So,
she resorted to writing salacious stories,

and now gets to sit
back and rake in residuals

without a single thought
to how she got there

or who put her there.

I am right, aren't I?

[thunder rumbles]

You know nothing about me.

You don't know what you're talking about,

and you should be fired.

[door bangs closed]



[instrumental rock music playing]

-[Tom] Hey, babe. -Hey!

Wow, smells great! Hi, kids.

-I made your favorite. -Mmm.



-[Alexandra] Hi, Dad. -How was school?



I don't know.

Weren't you gonna tell me about this?

It was just a meeting, I didn't think

-it was a big deal... -No, not that.

You weren't gonna tell me about this offer?

-[Mary] But... -That's more money up front

than all your other books combined.

Baby, let's have dinner. It's ready, okay?

Kids, hey, go to the table.

Hey, dinnertime.

Honey, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to keep anything from you.

-I didn't even see this. -I know,

but you have to seriously consider this.

All right?

I do?

Do I get an A? Do I get an A-?

-B? B+? What is it? -[Tom chuckles]

[audio fades]

Hello.





[crickets chirping]

I have something I need to tell you.

Um...

[clears throat] I messed up.

Well,
you know that proposal Barry brought me,

and he kinda taunted
me to go in with him...

[audio overlapping] It
wasn't my... He told me...

...perfect time... got in too early...

...in over our heads... I figured that...

...it was before we ever...


When did you make that trade?

Um, six months ago.

Six months ago and you're just telling me?

Tom! How much?

Nearly half, I think it was...

Nearly half of the reserves?

Half of the reserves?!

You... You promised me!

You swore you would never do that again!

[audio fades]

[moans with pleasure]

You're taking the offer, love.

I don't know.

You've never seen me when I'm writing.

Doesn't matter.

After it's over,
you go back to normal, right?


I turn into a different person.


to get your ass out the door.

You could add momentum
to enter a new chapter.

To do the things that you want to do

so you can create the
things you want to create.

What you need is a full-time sitter.

Oh, what you mean to say is "nanny."

Mm-mm. I did not spend thousands of dollars

to conceive those children

just to spend thousands more

to pay somebody else to take care of them.

I have a client,
she's a headhunter for sitters.

Mm-hmm?

Here.

Hmm.

Well, if she's so great,

why aren't you using her?

Well, I can't afford her.

Plus, she only takes on certain clients.

Oh, hell, no!

No, those kids always end up with problems.

I only work at the
office three days a week,

but if I had to work full-time,

this is what I would use for child care.

The girls she recruits, they're different.

They go to ivy league schools,

they're fluent in at least two languages,

they cook, they clean,
run errands, everything.

I'm telling you, Mary,

it's exactly what you need to get through.

Mm.


[door buzzes]

Welcome, Ms. Morrison.
[Mary] Thank you. Hi.

Please sign in and then have a seat.

Angela will be with you shortly.

-Okay, thank you. -Mm-hmm.

[Mary gasps, laughs]

Hi!

[footsteps approach]

-[Angela] Hello, Mary. -Hi.

It's so nice to finally meet you.

-I'm Angela. -Nice to meet you.

If you come follow me,
I'll show you around.

Sure.

[children giggling]

So, here we have a little activity room.

One of several areas we have in the office.


[children, nannies chatter]


a state-of-the-art security system.

Most parents prefer to
have help inside the home,

but should you ever need to go out of town

and want supervision, we can provide it.

-Huh. -[Angela] I must say, Mary,

I think you will be very pleased

with what we can offer.

Our young women come
from impeccable backgrounds.

Many of them are
attending prestigious schools

and looking for creative
ways to pay tuition.

We provide scholarships
based on performance.

How about I send over

a few potentials for you to meet with?

If none of them work out,

we can revisit, go from there.


â™ª Ding, dong, ding â™ª

â™ª Ding, dong, ding â™ª


All right. I'll just get you
to fill out some forms.

Okay.

Oh, my God, I love your house!

It has the best lighting
ever. It's great for photos.

I recently got engaged, so,

I'm kind of using this as a
learning curve for myself.

And one little boy brother, total monster.

I'm so thankful for this
opportunity to be here,

-because I love kids. -Mm-hmm.

And I'm just so excited
to share the word of God

with your little lambs.

And I'm also a princess entertainer.

-Okay. -I actually have...

my tail in the car.


Yeah, so, I actually have a niece,

um, she's about eight years old.

I'm so happy because when she was a baby

she was gross. [laughs]
How old are your kids?

[Tom into phone] Hey, hon.

How are the interviews going?

No one impressive.

But, I mean, they're nice girls.

Not one?

Think you're being a little hard on 'em?



and apprehensive, but you and I both know

if you don't have any
help with the menial stuff,

it'll absolutely kill you.

Plus, it might be good for the kids.

I just can't picture anyone

taking as good a care of them as me.

This isn't easy for me, either.

You're the best mother.
No one can replace you.

Oh, honey,
wait. I think another one's arriving.


[indistinct chatter]

-[Mary] Hello, hi! -Hi!

You must be with Huntsman Enterprises.

-Yes. -Great! Come on in.

Welcome.

Thank you.

I'm gonna make some tea, if that's okay.

-Yes. -I've been at this all day

and I just need a little pick-me-up.

-Have a seat. -Oh, okay.

[kettle whistling]

[kettle whistling louder]

So, you read a lot?

Oh, uh, yeah.

Sorry. Whenever I can.

But don't worry,
I would never around the children.


Gosh, I think it would be amazing for them

to see a young person
reading an actual book.

Lord knows we need more of that these days.



-[Grace] Thank you. -Mm-hmm.

This is nice.


Mmm.

Oh, uh... Laddie,

-by Gene Stratton-Porter. -Stratton-Porter!

Oh, yes! I read A Girl of the Limberlost.

But it was years ago, I... Is this as good?

Well,
considering it's my third time [laughs]...

-Yes. -Wow.

Porter has this knowledge
and passion for nature

coupled with the rich girl-poor boy romance

set in the countryside
of the 19th century...

You could say I'm a little obsessed.

-[Mary giggles] -There's this quote,

the mother of the main character,

she hangs in the house.

It has nothing to do with the main plot,
but...

"The way to be happy is to be good."

-Hmm. -I'm sorry,

I realize I've never introduced myself.

I'm Grace.

Hi, Grace,
nice to meet you. I'm Mary Morrison.

So...

tell me about yourself.
Where'd you grow up?

Oh, uh, in a small town

called River Springs. You've
probably never heard of it.

Anyway,
I grew up there with a large family.

-[phone rings] -Oh, excuse me.

Sorry.

[into phone] Hi!

Uh-huh.

Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine with all those conditions. Uh-huh.

[Mary, distant] Well, that's wonderful.

Great, great...

Yeah... That's great!

Great, wonderful news...

[Mary continues talking, indistinct]

[door opens]


Alex is being mean to me.

No, I'm not. You're just being a big baby.

How is Alex being mean to you?

Who are you?

I'm Grace. I'm a friend of your mom's.

-Mom! -Honey,

your mom is on a really
important phone call.

Is that a drawing? Can I see it?

So,
then the elephant says to the zookeeper,

how dare you throw mud on me like that?!

-And he got really angry. -[Sam laughs]

Thank you so much, bye.
[Grace] So he took a big,

deep breath and sprayed

all this water on the zookeeper

and the zookeeper was drenched!



Hi, guys, how was school?

-Super awesome! -Great!

Good. Well, this is excellent!

Wow!

Can you guys go play in your room

while Grace and I finish our meeting?

-Sure. -I'll be in soon.

Ooh!

I didn't realize Blume wrote other stories.

If this were a library,
I would check it out.


follow me.

Okay,
I'm gonna pick a really good book for you.

[Mary quietly] Oh, this one's good.

Wait, you're a writer?

These are your books?

Well, yeah,
but I haven't written in a while.

I can't believe I'm standing in the home

of an actual writer!


Grace, um...

I don't know if I really
need someone full-time,

but I definitely need some help next week

if you're up for it.

Because I'm starting a new book.

Are you serious?

That would be incredible.

If you need to look for
something more full-time,

I totally understand.

No, no, no, this is perfect.

-Okay, great! -Thank you!

Oh, thank you so much!


Well,

I will see you on Monday.

See you on Monday. Thank you.

You're welcome! [laughs]

[sigh of relief]

[no audible dialogue]

She can't be real.

I need to get me one of those.

Oh, don't get too excited,
I only have her a week.

She's cute, though.

Hello.

Mom, can we go swimming, please?

-Yeah, please, can we go? -Please?

I can take them, if you'd like.

-Okay. Yes, okay. -Yes!

-[kids laugh] -Oh, my, oh, my.

Grace, do you want to borrow a suit?

I have one if you want to try one of mine.

-Yeah, that'd be great. -[Mary] Okay.

Would you like a cover-up?

-Yeah. -[laughs] Here you go.

Thank you.

-Let me help. -Yeah.



The only one-piece you have,
and it just happens to be

from the cover of a
Playboy swimsuit magazine?

Oh, listen,
I do not need to worry about her.

She is a prude!

And you know what they say about prudes.

I have nothing to worry about with her.

I mean, if anything, she needs my help.

Hey, babe!

Hey, nice to meet you, I'm Tom.



I'll see you tomorrow!

-[Elaine] Bye, babe! -[Mary] Bye!

-Wow! -Mm-hmm.


Well, you tell me.


-Mmm. -[kids chatter indistinctly]

[both moan]

-[kisses] -[chuckles]

When's the last time
we did it in the kitchen?

Oh, my.


Mm, mm! Wow!

-Mm. Right? -Uh-huh.

Come, come, come.

Come.

Yeah.

[heavy breathing]


Hi!

If it's fine with you guys,

I'd like to get them in the
shower and ready for bed?

Oh, no, no, that's okay. I'll do it.

No, no. That sounds great.

Thanks.

Okay. Okay, great. Come on, guys, let's go.

Yeah.


I have my girlfriend back, huh?

-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! -Pretty fun.

Mmm.

[water running]

Okay. Okay, guys, come on in.

Okay?

Ahh, yes.

Mm, I am impressed.

-Not bad, right? -Mm-hmm.

Oh, Grace.

You wanna join us for dinner, maybe?

Oh, that's so kind.

But I'm a firm believer

that this is important family time.

They're in their room,
playing, ready for bed.

-Today was so fun. -[Mary laughs]

See you first thing in the morning?

Yes, thank you so much, Grace.

Okay, thanks. Good night.
[Mary] Good night.





-Hi! -[Grace] Hi.

I brought you some goodies.

Grace, you did not have to do this.

You don't have to take
care of the kids and me.

I know, but I like to.

Please let me.

Okay! It's adorable.

Today's goal is the kitchen,

tomorrow is the office.


You are a godsend.


Mmm.


[Mary screaming]

Ooh! Ah!

Ah! Ooh.

Thank you, Grace.

Ugh, I don't usually take a
bath at 11:00 in the morning,

but I just thought maybe it would

get the ideas flowing, you know?

Ah.

Ow! Ooh!

Eee!


You know what I think we should do today?

Play hooky.

But what about...

It'll all be here when we get back.

Come on.

-[Mary] Here we are! -[door bell jingles]

[pop music playing over speakers]

Oh, this is too much, really.

No, Grace, you deserve it!


Could you fit my young
friend here for a new bra?

Oh, no problem, follow me this way.

Okay.

Okay. Be right back.

-[laughs] -I'm excited!

Me, too.

[sales woman] All right, here's a few.

Excellent.

Let me know if you need anything else,
okay?

Thank you.

Let's try this one, it's so pretty!

How does this feel? Let's have a look.

Um...

-Oh! -It's a little tight.

It's so lovely, though!

Here, let me adjust it.

That's good.

It's so pretty!

Oh, that's so nice.

Better.

-Yay! -[laughs]

Okay, let's try one more.

-Okay. -Here, let's try this one.

Okay, so this...

Let me get it for you?

There you go. This one is a front closure.

Let me help you.

Oh.

I remember when mine
used to look like this.


I never understood why
anyone wanted to go bigger.

I can barely keep these in order.

I agree, totally, yes.

There. Wow!

Turn around.

Have you ever heard the phrase,

"Youth is wasted on the young"?

That's how I feel about me. I wish...

that when I was young,
I had spent more time

just feeling good about my body

rather than worrying about all
of my perceived shortcomings.


This looks lovely.

In case you wanted to remember.

[knock on door]

Um, yes?

How we doing in there, ladies?

Great. Some of these are gonna work.

[sales woman] Great, good to hear.


Also, I have all these clothes

that I don't really wear anymore.

So, why don't you try 'em on,

see if anything fits.

-Okay. -Okay!

-Honey? -Hmm?

What do you think about
women who get plastic surgery?

What do you mean, fake boobs?

-I mean... -Mm, maybe something else.

Like a fake butt? [chuckles]

-I love your ass. -You sure?

-Yeah. -I don't know, though.

I mean, maybe I ought to consider it.

You know, it's not like I'm..

Thirty-five anymore.

Maybe, just,

you know, like, a little nip,

a little tuck, like a little...

something. What do you think?

You know what really gets me off?

What I find most exciting?

Your brilliance.

You're not only hot and perfect,

you're the most amazing
mother to our children,

and you have the most
creative and intuitive mind

that I've ever interacted with.

I have the pleasure
of living with that mind

every day of my life.

[clicks tongue]

Mmm, really?

Yes, really.

-Oh! -Sorry!

I don't mean to interrupt.

I just wanted to let you know, Mary,

that I'm gonna be in
a little late tomorrow.

I have a doctor's appointment.

-Okay. -The kids are in bed, asleep.

Thanks, good night.

All right, good night.

[door closes]

Mmm.



[clicks lighter]



[birds cawing]


I'm sorry, what?

Of the mother being the killer in the end?

You want our hero to
suddenly become the villain?

That's your idea of a twist?

I mean, it's on point

with where everything's headed right now.

On trend, don't you think?

Yes! Take this woman,

who we made into a hero and...

Flip it. Make her the anti-hero.

That's not actually the way it works.

I like it.

Just a thought.

You're the professional.

We trust you. You'll
come up with something.

Always do.

Are there any other notes

we want to give Mary while we're here?

I love how you paint your characters,

your descriptions, the world.

You're excellent at this, Mary.

Just think there's a real opportunity here

for you to explore her darker side.

She's longing for something more.

Your words are so vivid on the page...

...think if you could somehow
weave this into her back story,

then you would have
something truly special.

Okay.

All right.

[Mary exhales]

Have you ever been
attracted to a woman before?

Are you sure? Think about it.

No. [laughs]

It could all be in your head.

A subconscious fantasy.

It's like, one minute

she's like this innocent young child,
you know?

Then the next minute,
it's like she's this master seductress

and I'm just her lap dog
waiting for the next treat.

Honestly, you're probably just sex starved.

No, no. [whispers] Tom is amazing!

No complaints there.

I mean, in this strange,
sexual servant type of way,

I feel like she would do
whatever I asked her to do.

To me.

That's bad of me to think like that,
isn't it?

Careful, love, maybe this is her plan.

Get you hooked on her so that

she can overthrow your
kingdom and take everything in it.

Really?


I told you,
strange things happen when I write.

I'll say.

Make her your muse, then.

Use her and this thing and write about it.

You said you're having writer's block,
right?

-Yeah. -You're already paying for her.

Get the most bang for your buck.



You must have been some tough kid.


I was the grandson he always wanted,

and finally got.

Oh, hey, hon.



-[kisses] -[Sam] Okay, look at me.

How was your workout?

-[Mary] Good! I'm sore. -[Grace chuckles]


I got it.

Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey.

What's going on?

[kids talking, indistinct]

What,
did your instructor make you horny again?


But I do think we should go out tonight.


we have that fundraising dinner.

-[Mary] That's tonight? -Yeah.

I totally forgot.

I didn't even book a sitter.

I'm not doing anything tonight.

Um, if you need me to stay late, I can.

Oh, Grace.


-Can you help me? -Yeah.

-All right. -Stunning.

-Thank you, really? Great. -Mm-hmm.


if we're not gonna be late.
Okay, I'm coming.

-[sighs] -What is it?

I just wanted to say thank you.

I mean, this job,

you, Tom, the kids, it...

It means the world to me, Mary.

Oh.

Listen, Grace.

You...

are a very special young lady

and we are lucky to have you.

Are we going?

Yeah, yeah, of course we are.

All right,
we'll be back before midnight, okay?

-No problem. -All right.

-Have fun. -Thanks, Grace.

Good night, Grace.

[garage door opening]

She said she was one of eight children.

Mm-hm. I knew she was home-schooled.

So I...

don't really know her whole story,

but from what I gather,

we're the only people she has.

Do you think...

we should make her
more a part of the family?

[seatbelt clicks]


Shh.

[humming "Hush Little Baby"]

[continues humming lullaby]

-Oh, there they are! -Hi!

Hello, thank you for coming.

-So nice to see you. -Great to see you!

Thank you!


The boss lady, who is looking amazing!

-The boss lady, mmm! [laughs] -Thank you.

Look at those earrings, I love them!

-Thank you, thank you, baby. -Oh!

-Every seat filled. -[Mary gasps]

Tonight alone will raise more money

than all the other fundraisers combined.

-Amazing! -Cheers!

Congratulations!
How's the writing going, Mary?

I hear you're in the midst

of adding another book to the series?

All I can say is... finally.


she doesn't want to
talk about that tonight.

-That's true. -[Elaine laughs]

Live music is a rarity.

-Uh-oh. -That must be you.

[Elaine laughs]

-All right. -All right.


to answer your question, yes.

I am going to write another book

to add to my series,

but there's just one problem...

I really don't want to write it.

Well, book four has to be my favorite.

Yeah, you and everybody else,

but can I tell you something?

I wrote that book at one of
the darkest times of my life.

And so now, you know, it's...

Not that easy.

I love all the twists and turns.

Couldn't figure out who the
killer was until the very end.

If you don't mind me saying, Mary,

lean into the dark.

That's where your best stuff is.

[small combo playing light up-tempo jazz]

Shall we?


Oh, Grace, you didn't have to do that.

Could you do something else for me?

Could you put this on my back?

-[Grace] Yeah. -Thank you.

[inhales, sighs]


That feels good.

[Mary moans]

Whoo! [laughs]

Oops!



Go ahead.

Don't worry, no one can see you out here.

Wow, goddess!

Really?

[Mary laughs] Yes!

Yay!

Whoo-hoo!

Doesn't that feel good?

[Mary sighs]




Broke the story.


We should celebrate, right?

Not yet.

Well, maybe. Just a little.

Both of us. [laughs]

["Joey" by Concrete Blonde playing]

I used to be obsessed with this song.


Do you want a whiskey and soda?

Wait, wait. Are you old enough?

[Grace laughs] Yeah.


â™ª Don't get â™ª

-[Mary humming] -â™ª Crazy â™ª

Here you go.

-Thank you. -â™ª Detours â™ª

-Cheers! -â™ª Fences â™ª

-[giggles] -â™ª I get â™ª

â™ª Defensive â™ª

â™ª I know you've heard it all before â™ª

â™ª So I don't say it anymore â™ª

â™ª I just stand by and let you â™ª

-[giggles] -â™ª Fight your secret war â™ª

â™ª And though I used to wonder why â™ª

â™ª I used to cry till I was dry â™ª

-[laughs] -â™ª Still sometimes I get â™ª

â™ª A strange pain inside â™ª

â™ª Oh, Joey â™ª

â™ª If you're hurting, so am I â™ª

-â™ª Joey â™ª -Okay.

-Whoo! Ah. -â™ª Honey â™ª

-Oh, my goodness. -â™ª I've got â™ª


â™ª Some money â™ª

What? -â™ª All is â™ª

-What is it, Grace? -â™ª Forgiven... â™ª

I've never felt more loved,

more at home,

more a part of anything than...

when I'm here with you.


Oh, no, of course we would never!

We'll be here for you forever,
Grace, we love you.

-You're very special to us. -[crying]


Did you know that you're the reason

that I broke my writer's block?

-Really? -Yeah.

Yeah.




[playing "Mary Had a
Little Lamb" on recorder]


Bravo.

-Hey! -Way to go, you guys!

You did so great!

-One, two, three. -[shutter clicks]

-Oh, it looks so good. -So nice.

Good job, you guys.

Now, Grace, take one with us.

-No, that's okay. -[Sam] Please, Grace!

-It's a family thing. -Come on, hop in.

-Okay. -[Sam, Alex] Yay!


Here we go, everybody smile.

-[shutter clicks] -Very good, one more.

-Wonderful. -[Mary] You guys,

go get a cookie, okay? You deserve it.

-Yes, thank you! -All right.

Um...

I'd say they did pretty good.

[Elaine laughs]

Grace, could you just come
talk to me for a second?

Sure.

-I just... -Did I do something wrong?

No! No, no, nothing like that.

I-I... I just...

What happened the other day...

can never happen again, and...

I don't think that we
should even talk about it.

What happened?

I have no idea what you're talking about.

Okay, okay, good. Good.

All right, let's go back.

[Mary humming]

[door opens]


May I?


Mmm.


Let me make you happy.

All I want to do is make you happy.


[breathing heavily]



[door closes]

Oh, thanks, babe.

Mmm.

[both chuckle]

You're so hot.

Baby, I can't.

I can't, I'm writing.

-Okay. -Mmm.

[â™ª]

[â™ª]

[â™ª]

You are not allowed to disturb her, Sam.

Ouch, that hurt.

-Grace is right. -But Dad...

I know you miss her, but listen, bud,

we're gonna support your
mom by letting her work, okay?

And when she's done,
you can bug her all you want.

-Okay. -All right, go get in the car.

Oh, have we made you late?

Uh, no, I was gonna take the day off,
anyway.

In fact, after we drop the kids,

how 'bout we stop for a bite to eat?

Um, I would, but I...

Grace, I think you need a break

and I could use the company.

-Uh, okay. -All right.

[â™ª]

[indistinct chatter]

Hi, what can I get started for you?

I'll have a slice of quiche

and a Bloody Mary.

Okay, and for you?

Um, yeah. I'll have the same.

-All right, sounds good. -Thanks.

I've never seen this side of you before.

What do you mean?

Something about you is...

different. I'm not sure what,
but I like it.

Hm.


-Enjoy. -Thank you.

Apparently we should
let you out more often.

Give you a break from the little monsters.

They're good kids.

Oh, yeah, they are.

So are you.

Hey, I'm no kid.

[both laugh]

[server 2] Here you guys are.

So, how old are you, anyway?

How old do you think I am?

Well,
two weeks ago I would have said twenty.

Today, maybe more like forty.

Hm.

Mmm.

What?

I hope you like sprouts on your sandwich.

Sure! Now,
I haven't done this in a long time, okay?


Here we go!

Yippee!


better than this?

-[Grace] Nothing! -[Mary laughs]

So, what do you think?

-It's perfect. -[laughs]

[Mary laughing]

I always want to get to the other side,

but I never know how I'm gonna do it.


To an incredible woman

and a brilliant writer,

on her first draft.

Thank you, sweetheart.

I could never have gotten
this far without you, truly.

You are the best partner
a girl could ever have.


Oh, I brought this poem.

I first read it when I was in college,

I thought you might like it.


I shall walk up and down
the patterned garden paths

in my stiff brocaded gown

The squills and daffodils...

[audio fades]

[music, no audible dialogue]

And the softness of my body
will be guarded from embrace

By each button, hook, and lace

I see so much of myself when I look at you.

Mm.

Grace, I...

I think we should stop.

-Did I... -No, no, no.

You're perfect.

You're so, so perfect.


Who would do such a thing?

I've gotta call Tom.

[frog croaking]

[footsteps approaching]


-[Tom] If it matches with what I think...
-[Mary] Hey!

Hey, I've been trying to call you,
where've you been?

Oh, I guess I left my phone inside. So,
sorry.

Where'd you guys go?

-We... -Well, we thought about...

[both laugh]

We went to this place by the river,

it was extraordinary.

You remember that wooded
area that we found a while back?

Where you took me a few years ago?

Mm-hmm! Finally got some time to explore.

Well, maybe you'll take me there sometime.

Let me see this.

What's going on?


What?

When was the last time
you were intimate with Tom?

I don't know, like, uh...

I guess before I started writing.

You know what they say,

if he's not getting it from you,

where is he getting it from?

Oh, come on!

You're actually... You're
saying you think Tom...?

I mean, seriously.

First, you're just criticizing Grace.

Now, you're all paranoid about Tom.

I mean,
why don't you tell me what's going on.

-What?! -I mean, seriously.

First there's the fundraiser,

I saw the way you were looking at him.

Stop it.

What are you doing here now?

What were you guys talking about?

I was here to talk about you.

Me? What about me?

Let's talk when we can
get a little bit more privacy.

But just know that I love you

and I only want what's best for you.

You have to know that.

[engine starts]

Mmm!

Something smells good.

One of my family's secret recipes.

Something my aunt used to make.

Tom and the kids are...?

On a walk, I think.

Oh, babe! Oh, no.

Let me help you.

Put it down.

Let's be very careful.

Look. Ta-da!

[Mary chuckles]

No more E.R. visits.

Let me get you some chili.

Okay.

Mmm.

Do you know how beautiful you are?


Did you know that

tomorrow is my and Tom's anniversary?

I hope when I'm older
I look as good as you.


Did you hear me, Mary?

I bought a new dress,

it's black and it's backless.

I hope he likes it.

Mary.

Please.

You deserve this.


[Grace moans]

[breathing heavily]




-[door opens] -[Sam] Mom?

[door closes]

Hey, it smells great! What's cooking?

-Yeah, I'm starving. -[Sam] Me, too.

I... I'm just suddenly not
feeling so great, baby.

I think I'm just gonna go lay down, okay?

I'll get you some water.


Hey, guys, how was the park?



I love you, babe.

Mm, love you more.


Tom.

[Grace, distant] Not that hard, you idiot!

[indistinct distant yelling]

[Grace moans]

[Tom and Grace moaning]

[moaning continues]


[Tom and Grace breathing heavily]


Oh, that's it.

[both panting, moaning]


Oh, that's a good boy.

Who's in charge?

I said, who's in charge

and will always be in charge?!


she won't remember any of this.


Yeah, sort of, yeah.

Just had a horrible dream.

Sam, Alex, time for dinner.

Come on, take your seat.

No more video games.

Well, as long as you survived your dream,

that's all that matters.


I seem to remember you saying that

this was sacred family time.

So...

what the hell are you still doing here?

What are you talking about?

Um, she's right.

Must have been a pretty awful dream.

Teacher says a bad dream
is actually a nightmare.

You and my husband

-were fucking! -[Tom] Mary!

Over there, on the counter!

-Damn it! -It was so real!

It was so real!

And you were like a
totally different person,

you were like somebody else.



Mommy's not feeling very well.

I think you need to go back and rest.


I'm really sorry.

When Mommy writes,

sometimes the things
in her mind are so vivid

that she can't tell the difference between

the imaginary and the real.

What happened to you out there?


I'm not really sure.


I do know, actually.

You know that nightmare?

That's really how I feel about us.

That's how I feel about you,

that's how I feel about everything.

Because for the longest time,

I've just been sitting in the backseat

and I've been letting you drive.

And I've been supporting you

in everything that you wanted to do.

And I've been taking all of my
energies and all of my talents,

and pouring them into you

and into the kids and into this life.

Because I wanted to
build something together.

And what do I get for it?!

What do I get for it?!

Fucking screwed!

You betrayed me!

-You crash us into a wall -Come on, Mary...

-and then, and then -Mary...

You expect me to pick up the pieces

and make everything better again!

-Mary, I'm sorry. -No!

-Come here. -No, don't comfort me!

-Come here. -Don't comfort me!

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry, I fucked up.

But you're my world,
you're everything to me.

You and the twins.

I want to find a way to make it up to you.

I promise, I will.

And you're right, we're never gonna

live like that again.
No! You're damn straight!

Yeah.

-You mean everything to me. -[sniffs]

Come on. You're almost through.

Just let's not let this thing

kill us on the way out.

-All right. Yeah. [sniffs] -Okay?

[laughter echoes]

-Happy anniversary. -Happy anniversary.

I'm gonna head in early today.

-Rendezvous tonight? -Yeah.

[Mary into phone] Oh,
hi, this is Mary Morrison.

I'm calling about a check
that I sent in a while ago,

but it seems like it
hasn't been deposited yet.


I've been meaning to call you.

Yes, I have your check right here.

I was just waiting to hear

which caregiver you want to go with.

What?

I should have called you sooner,

I'm sorry, we've been terribly busy.

Um...


You have a Grace, right?

Sorry, we don't have anybody by that name.

Mary?

Um, okay, thank you.

Thank you so much. Thank
you for letting me know

that it will be deposited soon. Okay,
bye-bye.

I was thinking of changing
the master bedroom sheets.

Since it's your anniversary.

Yes, of course.

Grace, I...

I just want to apologize about last night.

I really don't know what came over me.

I think I had a fever.

I understand.

Nightmares can feel so real sometimes.

If this were a library,
I would check it out.


follow me.

She's your best friend and you
don't even know her last name?

I do know a book she checked out recently

is Laddie, by Gene Stratton-Porter.

Ah.


The only person to check out Laddie

in the last three months.

Elaine, please, please call me back,

I need to talk to you.




[latch clicks]

Oh! Thank God, here you are!

I've been trying to call you!

You would not believe... [gasps]

[gasps, screams]

Oh, my God!


Ah! Oh! 911!

Please hurry!

Please come! Oh, my God!

[distant sirens]


Mrs. Morrison.

Would you mind coming down to the station

to answer a few questions?

Of course, whatever you need.

Your husband's going to meet us there,
okay?

-Okay. -Okay.

an open and shut case.

[officer #2 sighs]

So... a writer, then.

Mm-hmm, yes. Yes, I'm a writer. Um...

Is my husband here yet?
I'd really love to see him.

He's on his way, Mrs. Morrison.

In the meantime,

you mind telling me what
medications you're taking?

Any kind of psychosis you
may have been diagnosed with?

Wh-What?

What is this?

We have footage of you, Mary.

Early this morning, around 1:00 am,

driving to the location of the deceased.

That's not possible.

And the deceased is my
friend and her name is Elaine.

We also have a witness,
a neighbor of yours,

saying you and Elaine were
in some sort of argument

yesterday evening outside your home.

Do I need a lawyer present?
Because I thought I was

just coming here to help
you with the investigation.

And we have your fingerprints
on the murder weapon.

The scissors Elaine were stabbed with.

That's just not possible.

Mary, the evidence is all pointing one way.

You either tell me something I don't know,

or I'll lay it out for you.

That could be anyone.

We found this too, among your belongings

hidden in your writer's room.

Too many similarities
between this made up story

and the one going on in real life,
wouldn't you say?

No, this does not make sense!

Anyone else have access to your work,
Mrs. Morrison?

Yes, of course, my publisher.

-My husband. -You're so hot.

Oh, and our nanny, Grace.

[door opens] Mary, don't say another word.

Oh, babe.

Honey, I'm so sorry.

It's all right,
we're gonna figure this out.

How is Rick doing?

He's in shock.

He doesn't think you did it, either.

I don't understand how
I'm the main suspect.

Well, they don't have
enough evidence to hold you.

But what...

What about the
fingerprints on the scissors?

Well, my fingerprints are on them, too.

The kids' fingerprints are on the scissors.


Mary, where, um...

Where... Where were you last night?

I-I got up to smoke...

and then I saw that the light
was on in my writer's room,

so I went there to check.

But nobody was there,

and I locked it up and
then I came back to bed.

-You didn't go anywhere else? -Mm-mm.

After you checked the house, you didn't...

No. No, honey.

You were gone for nearly three hours.

Honey, really, I came right back to bed.

You believe me, don't you?

The slashed tires on the bike...

They found a Swiss Army knife in the garage

and the blade matches
the markings on the bike tire.

And yours are the only
fingerprints on that knife.


When was the last time

you were at Elaine's office for a session?

Years ago.

Well,
they found some handwritten note that...

seemed like a diagnosis,

or that it outlined what you have.

That is the time that I met
her at the gym to work out.

Those notes, they could be...
They could be about anyone.

I know.

[Grace, echoing] Who would do such a thing?

Um...

Uh...

I've got to go to the restroom, okay?

[footsteps fade]

[tires squeal]


Really,
I'm on my ass wanting to speak to you.

Where are you?

If you need something,
if you're in trouble...

I love you.


[normal voice] Meet you at home.

[turns off engine]

[dog barking]




There's no point in standing there.

I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not selling anything.

I was just hoping I could talk to you.

It's about Grace Taylor.


I'm her aunt.

Oh, um, I just drove two hours to get here,

would it be okay, I really need a restroom.

Could I come in?

Thank you so much.


Okay, thank you.

I don't know what she wants.
Something about Grace.

[deep voice] What the
hell you let her in for,

for heaven sakes!

[door opens]

I am so sorry that I
just showed up like this.

It's just that I'm Grace's employer.

She looks after my children.

I was hoping that maybe you could help

answer a few questions about her?

You're not from around here, are you?

[deep voice groans] Christ.

Here we go again.

-[normal voice] Have a seat. -[Mary] Okay.


My Grace was one of the oldest.

After her parents were sent to prison

for nearly starving
their children to death,

and God knows whatever
else they did to those kids,

she came here to live with me.

Last I heard, she got a job

at one of those hoity-toity fitness clubs

-in the city. -[dog whines]

-[dog barks] -[deep voice] I said no!

Idiot, get back in there!

-Dumb dog! -[dog yelps]

Christ!

[metal scrapes]

[dog whimpers]

[normal voice] That's a good boy.

-That's a good boy. -[dog whimpers]

That's a good boy.


[laughter echoes]


to kick your ass out the door.

Use it as momentum to
enter into a new chapter

and to do the things that you want to do,

so you can create the
things you want to create.

...run errands, everything.

I'm telling you, Mary, this is

exactly what you need to get through.

You have a lot going for you, Grace.

Many talents.

-[child cries] - Oh.

â™ª FrÃ¨re Jacques, FrÃ¨re Jacques â™ª

â™ª Dormez vous? Dormez vous? â™ª

â™ª Sonnez les matines Sonnez les matines â™ª

â™ª Ding, dong, ding Ding, dong, ding â™ª

As I was saying...

You are obviously a delightful
and talented young woman.

Unfortunately, we just aren't taking on

any new caregivers at the moment.

We'll be sure to keep you
in mind for the future, though.

I really need this job.

What is it?

I'm not fancy enough?

Didn't go to the right schools?

I'm overqualified compared to those brats!

I'm sure you'll find a nice
family who needs your help.

Plenty of them exist.


We'll be sure to keep you
in mind for the future, though.

Thank you for seeing me so soon.

I really appreciate it.

And if you need help with anything at all

around the office, cleaning, whatever...


[into phone] Tom, I'm on my way, okay?

But whatever you do,
do not let Grace into the house.

I have reason to believe
that she's really dangerous.

So, whatever you do,
please don't let Grace in.

-[phone beeps call ended] -Tom?

-[phone beeping] -Tom?


you go back to normal, right?

[Mary, distorted] But I
turn into a different person...

[water running]

[video game sounds]

[footsteps clicking]

[water stops]


Yep, it's me.

I thought we could use a little playtime.

Grace, I already told you,

I don't want to play these
games with you anymore.

You told me you loved games.

All men love games. [chuckles]

You've been a terrible boy, Tom.

And it's time for you to pay.

Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

-Now, you listen... -No, you listen!

You will do exactly as I say

or suffer the consequences.

What are you talking about?

Are you crazy? Are you fucking insane?!


One thing you should know about me, Tom,

is I'm completely insane.

And I always get what I want.

[flower pot shatters]

I don't want to have to hurt you,
but I will.


You hurt me?

That's hilarious.

-Uh! -Oh!


[both struggle]

-[slices] -[Tom] Oh!

Wait! Grace!

-[slices] -Ah!

[grunting with effort]

Grace!

-[slices] -Ah!



[breathing heavily] I told you,

I always get what I want.

[turns engine off]

Tom?

Honey?

[Tom weakly] Mary...

Here!

Coming!


Kids?

Kids?

Tom, where are you?


-I'm so glad you're here! -Grace!

Where are the twins? Where's Tom?

The twins are in the game room, safe.

Tom has...

Oh, No-no-no-no! Don't go in there!

It-It's a mess.

-I'll get some things... -Tom?!

-[Mary] Tom! -[Grace] I'll clean it!

Where are you?

-Here... in here. -[Mary] Tom!

[Tom gasping] I'm in...

-I'm in here. -Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! What happened?!

I... I didn't mean to...
I never wanted to...

Honey, don't talk.
You gotta believe me...

I do!

She sedu... seduced me!

-[Mary] It's all right. -I never want...

Okay, okay, I believe you,
please, don't talk.

Just hang in there, okay?


Oh! I'm-I'm so sorry for the mess!

Grace! Grace!

I need you to call 911
right now! Right now!

[breathing heavily] Okay. Right,
right, right!

Um...

Hello? Yes, um...

We need an ambulance.


and he's-he's... he's dying!

And he's gonna bleed to
death if you don't come soon.



Grace?

Who did this?


I tried to stop her!

I told her you were nice people

-and you could help us. -[weakly] Honey...

You tried to stop who?

Me, you cunt!

Margaret.

Kill her, bitch!


Please don't make me!



She betrayed you. She doesn't love you.


She does love me! She does!

You love me, Mary, right?

Grace?

[in Grace's head] Kill her, bitch!


[in Grace's head] Kill her, bitch!

Kill her, bitch!
[Grace] I can't stop her.

-[Tom] Run! Run, Mary! -[Grace] Run!

Kill her, bitch! Kill her, bitch!

[Mary screams]

[distant ruckus]

[video game sounds]

Hey!



[both screaming]

[blender whirs]

-[rips] -[screams]

[Grace screams] Mary!

-Grace? -[crying] How could you?


[Mary screaming]

[door handle rattling]

Too bad, so sad. [chuckles]

And Grace was actually
starting to like you.

Thought she could get rid of me.

Replace me with you.


Leave me alone!

[Margaret chuckles]

Now, we know that can never happen now,
don't we?

ever get along in this world

if it weren't for me?

Let's play our game?

Not now, Adam.

Come on, please?



I'm the one who got us through hell!

And this whore just thinks she can

waltz right in and replace me? [laughs]

Because of love?


-[in head] This isn't love. -Shut up!


is use you!

Eat you up and spit you out, Grace!

Until there is nothing left of you!


[in head] We have to make her go away,
Grace!


-Leave me alone! -[Mary screams]

[in head] No, the bitch must die!


[in head] Kill her! Kill her!



Grace! Grace, Grace.

Grace?

[Grace moans] Mary...


Please don't give up on me.

I won't.

-I love you, Mary. -[sirens approach]


I love you, too, sweet girl.

[fire crackles]

[Tom, kids chatter in distance]

[â™ª]

[kids laugh]

Working on a new book in the series,
Ms. Morrison?

Actually, no, I'm doing something different

that I've been wanting
to do for a long time.

Bye.

Bye.


All I needed was to get
my ass kicked out the door.

It's all for you.


[wind whistling]

Hi.

[knocks on door]

Deal me in.

-Mary! -[Mary chuckles]

Mm, I've missed you!

Aw, I've missed you, too.

-I have something for you. -[gasps]


-Ta-da! -[gasps]

Oh, you're the best!

Simply the best!

-Thank you! -[laughs] You're welcome!

What are we gonna play?

Um, Crazy Eights.

Okay!

Four, five,

six, seven,

eight.
