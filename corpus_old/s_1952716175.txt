<i>After the Terror wars,
Governments fell.</i>

<i>Corporations took control,</i>

<i>fighting over what remained.</i>

<i>Eight companies survived and
divided up the world.</i>

<i>Those companies were collectively
known as IRON FIST.</i>

<i>The American territories fell
to the mightiest corporation of all,</i>

<i>Tekken.</i>

<i>Once a year,
they hosted a tournament...</i>

<i>which was no game. Kill or be killed.</i>

<i>Outside the walls of Tekken city</i>

<i>in the burned up slums
they call the Anvil...</i>

<i>That's where it all started.</i>

Tekken

<i>5 days earlier</i>

Anvil.... Sector 197742-C7-443

Open up!

I told you to use the side entrance.

I have knocked, nobody answered.

I can't hear anything over
all these whole din.

Hey! This is real music,

not that corporate shit they're
playing in the city.

What was that song you're
playing last week?

-The Roaches?
-The Beatles!

You see what I am talking about? Lost
of art! The end of creative thought.

What happened to you?
It's nothing.

You're the only one who
gets through the gang zones.

I don't know how you do it.
I guess I am motivated.

What you are Jin, is a believer in the
cause. You just don't know it.

I am not a joiner, Bonner!

Come on man! Play your cards right!

One day... these could all be yours.

20,000 gigs. Get's some serious speed
with this.

For what?
Secret internet...

new underground,
of the Tekken subgrid.

Sorry I asked.

Used to be you had a choice.
free market, justice system...

Now, everything's Tekken.

Look... just save the speech

...until after you paid me.
Woah...

Keep the change.

What's this, Bonner?

You said global dollars.

I say a lot of things... I drinks...

You said 'Global' dollars.

Oh...

We good?

Now, we're good.

When you going to need another run?
Don't know.

Iron Fist coming up.
Jack Hammer is cracking down.

Now you're talking.

Jin, get back! How about another one?

<i>Disciplinary Unit Instructions!</i>

<i>Fallen... through discpline.
Peace... through grace!</i>

<i>These are the goals
demonstrated each year</i>

<i>in Iron Fist tournament.</i>

<i>These reigning champions
for the past four years...</i>

<i>We are honored
to host the Iron Fist tournament</i>

<i>in Tekken city.</i>

<i>Strength through order!</i>

<i>That is Tekken!</i>

<i>Thank you for your loyal listening
and appreciation.</i>

<i>There are just two days left before
the kick off the Iron Fist tournament.</i>

<i>That's right, there's two days left!</i>

<i>And how could you begin back where
it all started, here in Tekken City.</i>

-With Iron Fist I can go in...
-Ahhh... too early to tell.

How's my tab?
You're up to $350.

Tap out.

How about now?
Ooh!

That's why you're my
favorite customer.

Catch you later!

Hey!
Hey!

You got anything interesting?

Everything I got is interesting to
somebody. You know what I mean?

How about coffee?
Coffee...

Yeah. Coffee!

That's 100 an ounce.
Jesus!

Hey man! This none of that free drive

step going into them bullshit,
you know what I mean?

You know what they used
to call Columbian?

That's what that is right there,
this is the good shit, my friend!

Alright.

Give me one of those oranges too.
And a bar of chocolate.

Aww... business must be booming.

That will $200 Tekken ring.

-How bout a $100 global blue?
-That will work.

Nice doing business with you.

Always.

Hey Jin! Haven't seen you around man!

Been busy.

Thought of anymore better offer?
No! Sorry.

Hey! Just wait a minute, man!

You're tough, man!

I used to watch you street fighting.
That was for money.

And this is for a cause.

Heihachi Mishima and his Tekken
gestapo treat us like slaves.

I have got my own life, my own problems.

I told you man, this asshole is...

...a waste of time.
-No... no!

He's just another punk who'd rather
die in the Anvil

than stand up like a man.

Hey! Hey man!

Is everything prepared?

Representative fighters are en route
from their home corporations.

Good! Good!

I am transferring command on
Tekken Jack Hammer

to you for the duration of
the tournament.

Oh... father, I am honored.

Take the security in the Anvil in
the outer sector.

I will send additional units to
patrol for anti-corporates insurgents.

Not even minor inference
will be tolerated.

With respect...

I should have given the
speech tonight.

A chance to pass the torch,
from father to son.

When I think you're ready.

I have been ready for years!
Which is obvious to maintain security...

Do not disappoint me.

I remember those moves.

You should. You were my best student.

I was your only student, Mom!

You hungry?
I have been mashing protein squares.

How about an orange?
Very funny!

Coffee?

You always talk about missing
it so much.

These must have cost a fortune!

I can afford it. Runs have been good.

Jin, running anti Tekken contraband
will get you killed.

I could always enter "Iron Fist"...

... make some real money.

You will have nothing to do
with Tekken! Do you understand?

I will not have you waste your talent.

Well, it wouldn't be a waste. It pays.

And what difference does it make?

Who cares where the money comes from?

I care.

This is not what I trained you for.

And what the hell did you
train me for?

Do you think that life
on the other side of that wall

will bring you happiness?

Trust me! it won't.
Oh... here we go.

The world burnt because people
had to have more.

And this is better?

Rationing protein squares?

Is that what my father would
have wanted for us?

Don't!

Why won't you ever talk about him?

Your father is dead.
That's all you need to know.

You know what! Forget it.
I am out of here!

There's a curfew tonight.
There are Jacks everywhere!

The Jacks are always everywhere!

I am telling you not to go!

Jin?

Hey, Kara!

Come here!

Where have you been?
Been around...

What is it?
Chocolate.

Are you serious?

Sounds like I have been replaced.

We cut it in yet?
Another minute.

We're dropping it on the
west firewall.

We will be inside the Tekken video
sub grip for 60 seconds.

We will interrupt this program
to bring you the truth.

No one understands how
you're not dead.

Guess I am lucky.

About to get lucky.

I miss you.

Wasn't easy back tracing your hack.

It was smart to use none
of Tekken's hardware.

Now... almost none.

Now this, is an American classic.

Your revolution will not be televised.

Oh shit!

Jacks!

We got to separate. You will be fine.

Sir, we have located the insurgent
in Sector 9.

Burn everything! And everyone.

But sir, our men are still in there.
I don't care! Destroy it!

<i>You will have nothing to do with
Tekken. Do you understand?</i>

<i>I will not have you waste your talent.</i>

Tekken?

Jin...

I should have been him!
She asked me not to go!

It's not your fault.

Heihachi Mishima killed her!
I know how you feel.

My father was killed in a
Jack Hammer raid.

And what did anyone do about it?
Nothing!

What does anyone ever do about it?

Nothing!

He's going to pay for what he has done.

<i>Contestants for open call,
please proceed to Tekken east gate.</i>

Ok! Ladies and gentlemen! Listen up!

So who's going to be the next
People's choice?

And the next Iron Fist champion, huh?

Hey! We will never win this shit anyway.

Ain't nothing but a goddamn meat
grinder to pump up the crowd.

Take off!

A real north wind is coming.

So my guess is you going to need oil
to keep those kitties from freezing.

I got $100 global dollars.

$100 global dollars to any man who will
go one round against "Marshall Law."

One round!

You're a bunch of wankies,
every last one of you.

Except you, white boy! Inside!

Last call!

Going?

Going...
Wait!

I want to sign up.

Ok! Sign here!

Leave the bag!

Knock yourself out!
Dead man walking!

Hey... gentlemen, as you know,
this is a corporate event.

3 minute round.
So, please make it entertaining!

Eh... big guy! You're up first.

You scared?

I am fine.

I am not.

Hey, where you going?
To hell with this!

Wanker!

Eh! He's up next.
Get him in the cage, now!

Hey! Isn't that Jin?

Hey! That one is Jin.

I am going to Iron Fist,
and you're in my way!

You will learn some respect.

<i>This kid doesn't have what it takes
to stand up to Marshal Law.</i>

He's going to be roadkill!

<i>- Break free!
I can't!</i>

<i>If you could still breathe,
you could still fight.</i>

<i>You're only beaten when you decide!</i>

<i>Again!</i>

<i>... has just become
the Peoples choice.</i>

Respect!

Do you hear it?

I have never seen Marshall Law
beaten by an amateur.

Ratings are up.

Our viewers love him.

He represents the street.

Let's see what the street is talking.

Hey... come on!
Give us some space. Move!

Come on! Out of the way, come on.
Give us some space.

What's your name?
Jin.

Jin! You know what you just did, Jin?

You just beat a Tekken fighter.

Hey! You say you're from
the Anvil, huh.

Right...

So... who taught you to fight?

My mother.

Huh! Your mother? No way!

She's dead.

Eh! You just won the only
open slot in "Iron Fist."

Every other fighter in this tournament
has sponsors, everyone except you.

Say, who's taking care of

registration, paper work, training...
all the silly little details.

I can take care of that for you.

What's in it for you?
I don't know... 30%.

What? You take 10.

I like your attitude, but no!

20% and we're done.

Fine!

Smart choice! Let's go!

Eh! You don't have anything
to pack, do you?

I don't think so. Come on!

<i>I remember those moves.</i>

<i>You should. You were my best student.</i>

<i>You will have nothing to do
with Tekken! Do you understand?</i>

<i>The world burnt because people
had to have more.</i>

<i>Tekken was built on people
wanting more.</i>

What is the old man waiting for?

I am his son... his heir.

Tekken should be mine now.

Kazuya!
Father ...

I see that.

Explain yourself!

We wiped out a pocket of insurgents.
I took a moment to unwind.

You should be making preparations
for Iron Fist.

Everythings been taken cared of.

After all this time,
you still don't understand.

Winning Iron Fist

means power and prestige for Tekken!

And honor for the Mishima name!

Winning here means we win
in the world.

So you said!

Eh! You stay close to me, ok!
Keep your mouth shut.

Eh! You got to stop checking the Jacks.

-Why?
-It's not the Anvil!

This is civilization, my friend!

Land of opportunity!

Let's go!

Raven. G-Corp.

Former military intelligence,
from technology to webwork.

Lethal. Ninjitsu expert..

Eddy Gordo from Valencorp.

Capoeira master. Underworld enforcer.

There's a price on his head
from a neo Salvadorian group.

He's powerful
but he is easily frustrated.

Sergei Dragunov, Sambo fighter.

Trained by the now defunct
Russian military.

Spent a year in a Siberian gulag for

search warning governemnt
re--integration.

Anna and Nina Williams, sisters.

Professional assasins from Eyderdex.

Wanted by 3 Corporations for
Exec level hits.

Master in Koppo and Aikido.

Christie Montero, Vectrocorp.

Skilled mixed martial arts trained
by her grandfather.

Also easy on the eyes.

Miguel Rojo, Zipota Specialist.

He's all style strategy

but he's a crowd pleaser.

Yoshimitsu, Master swordman.

A true samurai warrior.

And finally.. Bryan Fury. Power boxer.
Kenpo fighter at his physical peak...

and our current Iron Fist champion.

What is this? Are you kidding me?

It's signature.

I am not wearing those.

See, things are different now Jin.
This is "Iron Fist."

Iron Fist, image is key.

You have your signature move.

And guess what, now you
have your signature look.

Steve Fox.

Who is this guy?

Never seen him before.

Who raps?

Just another amateur.

He's nothing.

So they must love you.
They gave you Marshall Law's digs.

Stick around. I will be right back.

What's your problem?

Nothing...

You know it's rude to stare.

Sorry. I was just admiring your toes.

Excuse me?

I mean Baguazhang requires very
precise foot placement the way you

spread your toes, it's uhmm...

it's impressive.

You studied Bagua?
A little.

Who are you anyway?
The name's Jin.

So you're the Peoples choice?

You seem surprised.

You don't look like much!

You will remember you said that,
when I win Iron Fist.

Right...

Eh... Jin, this way!

See you in the arena!

<i>Coming to you live from this year
Iron Fist tournament in Tekken City.</i>

<i>That's right. History was made</i>

<i>when for the first time a wild card
open call play was won by an unknown.</i>

<i>His name is Jin.</i>

<i>This young fighter won with
spectacular style</i>

<i>and will appear next to the world
greatest fighters.</i>

<i>Raven!</i>

<i>Miguel Rojo!</i>

<i>Nina Williams!</i>

<i>Anna Williams!</i>

<i>Sergei Dragunov!</i>

<i>Bryan Fury!</i>

<i>Eddy Gordo! Valencorp!</i>

Staring at my ass is a good
way to get yours kicked,

I'd keep my head in the game
if I were you.

<i>Christie Monteiro! Vectracorp!</i>

Eh... Jin! You feel ok?

I felt sick!

You think you're going to puke?
I already did that.

<i>The first Anvil fighter ever
to win an open call,</i>

<i>... Jin, the People's choice!</i>

He's quite impressive yesterday.

Yeah, but not on the same level as
the other fighters.

Maybe you should ask Marshall Law.

He caught Law at a weak moment.

Why are you so threatened
by this fighter?

I am not.

I just hate to see Tekken embarrassed
by a lucky amateur.

<i>Raven Vs. Eddy Gordo!</i>

<i>In the first round of the
"Iron Fist" tournament.</i>

-Bring it on, boy.
-Come on!

<i>Raven is the winner!</i>

<i>Advancing to the next round!</i>

<i>Miguel Rojo!</i>

<i>Jin, the People's choice!</i>

You're up kid!

Good luck!

This guy's a prick. He thinks he's the
second coming!

His ego tilts way too over confident.

He's damn good!
Yeah... he is.

But use that ego against him,
use the speed against him.

Tired this guy out, ok! Second move.

Let's go! Come on!

Come on! You ready? Let's go.

Eh! One last thing ok,
you get ready to release your jab

when he throws his right...

Everytime he throws his right,
he locked up his left knee, ok!

Great, thanks!

Use it!

Like I said, not in their league.

You know where you are?

This is Iron Fist!

Come on!

Yes!

Yes!

Get him!

That's it, kid.

Get up... Jin, shake it up. Get up!

So much for the People's choice ...

Shut up!

What's the matter, Monteiro?

The Anvil rat got under your skin?

When we see what's under your skin,
Cyborg!

What did you say?
You heard me!

<i>Never underestimate your opponent!</i>

<i>Watch! Attack!</i>

<i>Every strike should be your best!</i>

That's it Jin! Get up!

Jin!

Stop it! Jin! It's over!

You were saying?

Thanks for the tip.
Well, that's my job!

See, the more fights you win,
the more money I make.

Does that hurt?
It hurts everywhere!

Nice finish!

Very entertaining but
completely out of control.

You know you don't have time
for that shit right, huh!?

I know why I am here.

You do?
Yeah.

Good! Because you were damn
lucky in there.

Next time you got to get
everyone as quick as you can.

You got to hit him hard,
you got to hit him high!

Steve Fox.

Back from the Anvil.

Ohh! We both know
Tekken city is my home.

Of course...

I have heard you advised your expertise
to our new fighter.

Let me introduce you.
This is Jin, People's choice.

Well, congratulations on a
spectacular fight.

You have impressed my father,
not an easy task.

I'd like to thank
Mr. Mishima in person...

... for this opportunity.

Well, continue winning, and you will.

There's something familiar
about your style.

Did your father ever fight
in Iron Fist?

Didn't know my father.

Another common in the Anvil.

Work hard, keep training.

Someday you could be
an asset to Tekken.

I will never belong to Tekken.

We will see about that...

What was that?

Just... just do your job!

<i>Defeat is a choice, so is victory.</i>

<i>You're only beaten when you decide.</i>

Again!

I got to get out of here for a while.

Thought that was against the rules.

Not if you don't get caught.

<i>That's Jin, the People's choice...
entering the club.</i>

<i>Let's go! Give it up!</i>

Eh Jin, you were great today!
Thank you.

Three days ago, I got Gang Bang
trying to kill me.

And today you're a celebrity,
get used to it.

So what happened up there with Rojo?

I beat him! That's what happened.

You did more than just beat him.
You almost killed him.

Can I give you a little advise?

Iron Fist isn't about killing
or getting yourself killed.

So you brought me here to warn me?

I am just saying... an attitude like
that is going to get you in trouble.

Guess I should be more in-control.

Like you...

You don't know anything about me.

You grew up just outside
the American territories.

Your grandfather taught
you how to fight.

Entered you into amateur leagues.

Made you a champion.

I have seen you in the Iron Fist promos.

Well, those promos just showcase
on my skills.

Ok! He's gone.

I shouldn't ...
I think you should.

I need sleep.

I may have to kick your
ass tommorow morning.

You promise?

Go to bed!

Jin!

Stand up for Christ sake!

I knew it!

They're worried because they actually
believe you have a shot.

Nothing changes.

There's no way, no way
they're going to let someone from

the Anvil win the Iron Fist.

Maybe it has to do with
something else.

Where did you get this?

Belonged to my mother.

Jun Kazama.

I knew her!

You knew her?

We were in Iron Fist together.

That's not possible!

She was a Tekken fighter, Jin.
She was good.

You don't know what you're
talking about.

Every single thing about
your mother was unique.

Even her fighting style.

Why didn't she say anything?

Why would she lie to me?

Maybe she was trying
to protect you, Jin.

Listen to me, Jin.

Right now you need to get out of here,
go underground.

She's right.

I am not leaving!

Forget Iron Fist.
I don't give a damn about Iron Fist!

I came here to kill Heihachi Mishima.

Do you know what a nightmare this is?

I think you worry too much.

Don't talk back to me!

You failed me! He's still alive!

It was a fluke! It won't happen again.

No! You are underestimating him!

And now, I have to clean up your mess.

Stay where the TV cameras can see you.

They won't try anything if the
world's watching.

<i>Christie Monteiro.</i>

<i>Nina Williams!</i>

I think it was her.

What?

Nina Williams.

She was one of the assasins.

Good to know.

I am a little late last night.

I like your boyfriend, he's cute!

Sorry. I don't share.

A $100,000 global dollars to
whoever kills that kid from the Anvil.

What makes you think
I need your money?

Replacing bone with Flex steel
isn't cheap, is it Bryan?

Neither is the maintenance...

It's no wonder you could
punch through wall.

I am!

But the corporation's made me.

As I recall, Bio-enhancements
are illegal in Iron Fist.

Christ... Bryan, you're half robot.

You will be banned for life.

Log in the fights selector.

What are the Jacks doing here?
Extra security.

There was an incident inside
the barracks last night.

I read the report.

Insurgent forces inside Tekken.

There is no reason for concern.
I dealt with the problem...

... personally.

I don't want anything to
happen to this young fighter.

Hey! How're you feeling?

I am good...

<i>Jin! The People's choice!</i>

Let me see!

Shit!

Yoshimitsu!

Eh, I have something for you.

My old power gloves.

Well, it's been a long time.

A little worst for wear now...

Give me your hand.

It's going to keep you safe.

When you're out there today,
you stay smart, ok!?

You got to bob, you got to weave,
you got to fly if you have to.

But you don't let Yoshimitsu
touch you! Ever.

Take him!

Nice!

Re-cycle the challenges selection.

What are you doing?

This match is better suited for
the semi final.

No!

You can't do that!
These two have to fight, now!

Are you questioning me?
No, I am replacing you!

Jacks!

What are you doing? Stand down!

You put me in charge of security,
remember... father?

The Jack Hammers answer to me!

Kazuya, do not do this!

It's done!

I am through waiting.

Tekken is mine!

Maintain the original fight selection.

Jesus!

<i>Yoshimitsu was a past
Iron Fist champion.</i>

Look at the ratings, through the roof!

You see the only thing audience is
craving more than blood...

... is death.

You see father, I have learnt.

<i>Yoshimitsu is out for blood.</i>

<i>He's decimating Jin.</i>

Stop the fight!

There is no honor in this!

You are about to witness the
death of Jin Kazama.

Kazama?

Apparently the bi-product of one
of my youthful indiscretions.

You have a son!

I had a son!

<i>Security Alert!</i>

<i>Security Alert!</i>

<i>Destroy the mask of death.</i>

<i>And you will see there is nothing
behind that you fear.</i>

<i>Security Alert!</i>

<i>Security Alert!</i>

Damn you old man!

You... will regret this!

Take him!

<i>Security Alert!</i>

Enough of this!

Jin, take this off!

We got to get him out of Tekken city.

<i>Iron Fist fighters are to be detained.</i>

Jesus!

They arrested Mishima!

We need to get out of here now.
Come on, let's go... this way.

You can't arrest us!
We're Iron Fist fighters.

Get in there!

His shoulder is dislocated.
Give a hand over here!

Why the hell are you looking at me?
You want to help here?

Just do it!

Let's get you up! He's going to... Ok!?

Ok... on...

Three!
Thanks!

What are you trying to do?

My father always stress the
importance of Iron Fist.

Frankly, I never saw the value.

It was a brutal mindless game.

But I finally understand.

In the arena, perception is power.

After the audience thought
Jin killed Yoshimitsu,

the ratings spiked to their
highest level ever.

Which is why I decided...

that the remainder of the tournaments
fights, will be to the death.

I am sure you'd all rather
die fighting in the arena.

Iron Fist continues tomorrow.

I suggest you get some rest!

So what now?

We kill or be killed.

We have a choice.

If there are no fighters, there is
no tournament and no one has to die.

Alright, line up against the wall!

Hands behind your back!

Hands behind your back, I said.

I don't think so!

Come on! Let's move! Now!

This way, come on!

Lock us down!

Mishima...

Mishima...
You take it easy, Jin!

Jin Kazama!
You owe me a life Mishima.

I owe you nothing, young man.

How does it feel to be behind bars?

We got to move!

I am going to need those access codes,
right now!

Get me out of here, I can help!

Key!

This way, old man!

Heihachi Mishima is with them.

They're heading towards the
workers access gate.

Anvil: Green Zone - Tau sector

Move it! Come on!

Take it easy, you ok?
Are you ok?

Yes, I am alive.

Kazuya will be sending the
Jack Hammers.

I know a safe house. It's not far.

So maybe I am crazy. Can we go?!

Come on!

Tear the Anvil apart!

I want the fighters found,
and recaptured.

Go!

Rest!

A moment!

I knew your mother, Jun Kazama.

Formidable fighter.
One of Tekken's best.

My mother tried to keep
me away from Tekken.

Now I know why.

Do not judge all of Tekken
by Kazuya's mistakes.

Mistakes? Tekken destroys lives!

I created Tekken,
not only as a corporation

that is immune to stand the chaos.

We are remaking the world,
raising it from the ashes.

You tell that to the people die,
everyday, in the Anvil.

We brought humanity back from
the brink. We restored order.

Tekken is peace.
Tekken is fear!

My mother's blood is
on your hands Mishima!

I saved your mother's life.

What the hell are you talking about?

Many years ago after the tournament,
I found her beaten, violated.

I am the one that had to take
her from Tekken city.

It was always the sadistic part of him
that I could never control.

Who?

Kazuya... my son.

Your father.

You're lying!

Until today, there was only one
heir to the Tekken throne.

Now, there are two.

Jacks!

Get down, Jin!

Run! Run!

What?

You thought I'd do nothing?

Tekken belongs to me!

You never understood the
spirit of Tekken.

That's why I could not place
Tekken in your hands.

Tekken is in my hands, old man!

Don't you see?

It's over for you now!

It's not about me or you.

It's about the Mishima name.

A name that you have not lived up to.

And that's why in the end,
you will fail.

Take Heihachi Mishima away.

Destroy everything...

... including him!

I am Mishima Heihachi.

I am Tekken.

Heihachi Mishima is dead.

<i>Citizens of Tekken and the world.</i>

<i>Today, Iron Fist will make history</i>

<i>and you will be histories witness!</i>

<i>The remaining fighters will no longer
fight for the simple glory of victory.</i>

<i>Now, they will fight, as we all must
fight. Everyday we draw breath.</i>

<i>They will fight for their lives!</i>

<i>They will fight to the death.</i>

<i>Sergei Dragunov and Bryan Fury!</i>

<i>In the first round of the
Iron Fist semi-final.</i>

What? No hug for your old man?

I remember your mother.

She put up quite a fight.

Frankly, if I knew that whore
was pregnant,

I would kill her right then and there.

You want to kill me, don't you?

I... understand that.

But in order to get to me,
you will have to kill the champion...

Bryan Fury.

That's how Iron Fist works.

Get off of me!

Imagine what I will do to her
if you don't fight.

You will fight!

The world will watch!

And my legacy will be written
with your blood.

Take her!

When the time comes,
I pray you die screaming!

Behave yourself!

Jin, I saw what you did to Rojo.

You let your anger take
control of you.

Anger doesn't fuel the fighter's soul,
it incinerate.

But before that I saw something.

I saw greatness in you.

You're not just fighting
for yourself anymore, Jin...

you're fighting for all of us.

You can become champion.

There are a lot of people
depending on it.

<i>- So... who taught you to fight?
My mother.</i>

<i>Attack!</i>

<i>Your mother?</i>

<i>She's dead.</i>

<i>Do you think that life
on the other side</i>

<i>of that wall will bring you happiness?</i>

<i>Trust me, it won't.</i>

<i>I told you man, this asshole is
a waste of time!</i>

<i>He's just another punk
who'd rather die in the Anvil</i>

<i>than stand up like a man.</i>

<i>But you are Jin is a believer in the
cause, you just don't know it.</i>

<i>So... you're the People's choice?</i>

<i>You don't look like much.</i>

<i>My father was killed in the
Jack Hammer raid.</i>

<i>And what did anyone do about it?
Nothing!</i>

<i>One day you will have a
chance to make a difference.</i>

<i>That's why I trained you so hard.</i>

<i>Because one day, you will not just be
fighting for you and me.</i>

<i>You will be fighting for all of us.</i>

<i>I love you, Jin!</i>

<i>Bryan Fury Vs Jin,
the People's choice!</i>

<i>It all comes down to this moment.</i>

<i>Two fighters remained.</i>

<i>Bryan Fury and Jin,
the People's choice.</i>

Ain't nothing going to save you now, boy!

<i>It's been a hell of a
run for this young fighter.</i>

<i>But, can he last against Bryan Fury?</i>

<i>Every opponent has it's weakness.</i>

<i>See it... exploit it!</i>

<i>Strike!</i>

Jin, come on... Jin! Jin... Jin!

Yes!

<i>Did you see that?
This kid is full of surprises!</i>

Enough! Introduce me, the Final Match!

No!

Jin won!

He's the champion, you can't kill him!

Watch me!

<i>Now entering the arena, fighting for
the honor of the Tekken Corporation.</i>

<i>Kazuya Mishima!</i>

I should thank you.

Your coming here give me the
opportunity to take control of Tekken.

Your mother taught you any styles?

All quite strong.

Yes!

There it is!

The lust for vengeance!

The hunger to kill!

Like fire,
coursing through your veins.

You can't deny it, Jin!

It's what makes you who you are!

The curse of the Mishima blood.

Like father, like son!

It's your curse, not mine!

You won!

Citizens of Tekken and the world.
I give you, Jin Kazama!

The winner of Iron Fist,
the People's choice!

Now the People's champion!

I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

<i>You have got to say that that
was the greatest champion ever.</i>

Drinks on the house, it's on me!

Where you going to go?

It's time to go home.

<i>On that day,
the house of Mishima fell.</i>

<i>Tyranny had been
challenge and defeated.</i>

<i>And the name Kazama became synonymous
with hope, strength and freedom.</i>

<i>But freedom comes and goes.</i>

<i>And the world had no idea
or warning that the</i>

<i>true legacy of Tekken's
only just beginning.</i>
