[Glass breaking - Dog barking]

[Glass breaking]

Hey!

[TV playing]

What?

I cut my arm.

Told you to stay in your room.

But I've been in there ever sin...
Shut up and just leave me alone.

[Water running]
That's what you get for not listening.


[Car honking]

I'm going out.

Hey mom!

What?

You know what today is?

I don't have time
for your games right now

But mom, It's a really special d...
Dammit Eli!

You got blood all
over everything in here.

Mom, I didn't mean t...
How many times

do I have to tell you
to stay in your room?

Now stay in there or so help me!

[Door slams]
Mom, wait!

[Car door slams]

[Drawer opens]

[Cabinet doors slam]

[Front door opens]
Mom?

[Cabinet doors slam]

Dad!

How are you doing?

Good.

Hey, look at you.
Where's your mom at?

Out.

Out. What's that mean?
Where'd she go?

Hmm.

Skank owes me money.

Ooh.
What, no booze for your old man?

Hey dad.
[Fridge door slams]

Hey kid.

Know what today is?

I do buddy.

It's Friday.

It's alright. I know where
your mom keeps her cash. - Uh.

[Can slams against cabinet]
Where is it?

I, I don't know I...

Where'd she put it?
I don...


Don't mess with me kid.
Where's the money?

It's, it's right here.

Don't lie to me boy.
Where's the rest of it?

That's all I found!

That's all you found?

I swear!

You swear?
I swear!

going to lie to me.

No!

[Police talking over radio]

I knew he was going
to take that money.

He's not usually alone for this long.

It's not like this happens all the time.

It was my friend's party...

Social worker's going to meet you
in the ER at Providence. - Okay.

Is he going to be okay? - Uh, he seems
pretty tough. I think he'll be alright.

February 24th.
Today's his birthday.

Happy birthday, kid.

He can't go to the hospital.
I don't have insurance.


[Engine revs]

You're late.

So, I'm the boss. - Well, it wasn't
easy getting these seats, boss.

Okay so who's the target?
Margaret Summerfield.

Summerfield.
The oil Heiress.

Her portfolio lost 20 percent last year.
Probably not to happy with Lavallee.

Lavallee? Seriously?

That guy's a dinosaur.

You know what happens
to dinosaurs, they die.

They went extinct.
No, they died.

[Scoffs]
Soft spots?

Kids! - Seriously? She couldn't be into
like saving the whales or something?


Ms. Summerfield, good evening.
How are you?

Hello. - I heard Lavallee lead
you a stray on renewables this year

Oh my dear, yes. Renewables were
going to be the next internet.

I warn my clients to
stay away from them.

Seems Lavallee is gotten a bit lazy.
He's following fads.

Mr. Matthews,
I really don't think I...

So, um, which of tonight's charities
are you involved in Ms. Summerfield?

My church, St. Andrews,

sponsors a summer camp for foster kids.

Wait, Ken.

Isn't that the camp you're
volunteering for this summer?

You're going to be a camp counselor?

[Clears throat] Um, yeah.
I'm. I love kids.

I do. And It's actually
going to be the first summer

that I'm volunteering
at the camp.

I just find it to be...
of importance to

take time for the things
in life that matter.

Oh. It's so nice to meet someone
in this business who realizes

that there are more important
things in life than money.

It sure is.


room for another boy.

why do you do this to me?



[Phone rings]

Yeah, this is Tammie.

I noticed in your church bulletin
that you're looking

for more male counselors
for camp this summer.

My boss is really looking for a
way to give back to the community.

I'm hoping it's not too late.
I believe his mother goes to your church.

Great! Yeah, um,
what's his name?

Ken Matthews.

She does.
Beverly Matthews.

You know, he'd have to work
with a bunch of really rough kids.

Oh, he loves kids.
Adores them.

Well we will send over an application
and a background check.

He's already missed the training so he's
going to have to read the manual on his own.

I will make sure
he reads every page.

Okay good. Talk to you soon.
[Beep beep]

Ken.


Excuse me a second. So l got
the kids from Locustwood here.

Uh huh.
Word about this one.

History of attacking other kids,
Dad has a restraining order,

mom just died of an overdose
two weeks ago.

That's why I asked him to come.

Well, I just hope we don't
have to send him back.

Have faith Bonnie.
Have faith.

I know. Okay.

Sam, it's good to be
back at Pine Lake, huh?

Definitely.

[Mufï¬‚ed phone conversation]

No, no. Look, she needs to know
I'm at camp. Her camp.

Otherwise,
this whole thing's a waste of time.

Hey, Katelynn, I gotta go, alright?
Alright.

Hi there. I'm looking for
the camp director, Tammie.

You don't recognize me, do you?

Tammie Parker, Bridgepoint High.

Class of '99.

Oh, I should remember you.

Well y...
Wait, wait, wait.

Tammie Parker? Wow.
You used to be so um...

Fat. - Yes. No. What I meant
to say was you look great.

You didn't read the manual?

I skimmed it, yeah.

So then you missed the part about no
cell phones or personal vehicles.

Weren't you really into cars?

Like, the only girl in auto shop?

Yeah, weren't you supposed
to be like a big rock star now?

Yeah, well it looks like things turned
out just fine for me, doesn't it?

Why didn't you meet us at the church?

No offense but uh, I'm not
gonna ride up on the bus.

Don't jerk me around, Ken.
You're here to do a job.

You're looking at the
counselor of the year, okay?

Sam. - Reporting for duty.
This must be our new recruit.

Mmm hmm! And this is one
of my best counselors.

He's a retired Army Sergeant. He has
a healthy respect for the rules.

This is Ken Matthews. He's our
new counselor. Show him the ropes?

Yes ma'am. Glad to meet you.
Grab your bag, soldier. Let's get to it.

Are you sure this is our cabin?
Yeah, Spruce Cabin. We sure lucked out.

It's one of the nicer cabin's up here.
Nicer?

Yeah, it's real close to the bath house.

We got the best shot at the hot showers
before the water heater runs out.

Wow. Fantastic. - Plus, they did
a better job of sealing this one off.

So, we won't get as many of the
critters inside. - Critters?

Yeah, you know. Tarantulas,
snakes, the occasional rat. - Rats?

I ate one of those in basic.
Tastes like chicken.

That was a joke, soldier. A joke.

Uh, hey, Samuel.

These kids.
Yeah?

They're not normal. Right?

You didn't read the manual?

Uh, no I... - Good. It's a bunch
of namby pamby stuff if you ask me.

Look,
here's what you need to know.

You're not the foster parent or
the caregiver. You're not the teacher.

You're just here to help the
kid have fun for one week.

Easy enough.
[Phone rings]

It's really not that hard if...
[Phone beeps]

You leave your life behind and
you focus on your camper.

Hey, Kaitlynn, what's up?

We got a nibble from Summerfield.

Alright, let's seal the deal.

And let's not forget
who's amazing idea this was.

Make it happen, alright?

I want a raise.
[Phone beeps]

Don't let Tammie see that.
Come on, I'm gonna show you camp.

Little R and R before the craziness begins?
Yeah, I'm definitely a fan of that.

Pete here's an airline pilot most of the year
but this week he's in charge of the pool.

Right on man.
Swimming already huh?

Yeah, I like to open the pool for
the counselors before the kids get here.

Great idea. I used to be a guard
myself in high school. - Really?

Yeah, yeah. Alright,
I'm gonna go get my trunks I think.

So what I'm thinking is...

Hey, no cell phones.
I'll just take it and put it over here.

Hey, give me that back. Oh you girls
wanna play? Let's play. - Well.

[Screams - Splashes]

knows what he's gotten himself into.

[Screams - Splashes]

Where'd you find this guy?
Just keep an eye on him for me.

[Splashes - Laughter]


Eat up.
Only goes downhill from here.

This is better than
the chow they gave us in Baghdad.

He's joking, right?

It's amazing what you'll
eat when you're hungry.

Hey Everyone!
Glad to see you're back.

These kids have had rough lives

and this is our opportunity
to share our hope, with them.

Couple quick reminders.

There are no cell phones
around the kids, Lacee.

Yeah. See,
all these new smartphones,

they're just a temptation
for the kids to steal them.

Bonnie, dress code.

Okay.

One piece bathing suits
or cover-ups, ladies.

I don't want to see any
of that cleavage or crack.

Lacee.

Alright,
so without further ado,

the moment we've been waiting for,
camper assignments.

Tammie?
[Excited chatter]

Alright.
We've put a little bit of information

about each camper
on the back of the card.

Keep them with you as a reference.
Redford! [Cheers]

What's the big deal with Redford?
Thinks he's an alien. Great kid.

Alright, we're dismissed!

Go get your cabins ready.
We're going to have a good week!

[Applause - Cheers]

[Phone beeps]


Alright guys.

I can't believe it's
already been a year. Right?

Ken!

[Mufï¬‚ed phone conversation]

Come here,
we're going to say a prayer.

Hold on, let me call you back.
[Phone beeps]

Let's pray that God helps us be a
blessing to the kids this week, right?

[Mufï¬‚ed prayer]
Not a praying man, huh Ken?

Not exactly, no. - Well, you
might be by the end of this week.

[Mufï¬‚ed prayer]

[Engine roars]


You're going to love camp! There's a
pretty good chance that my friends,

the ones from out there,
are going to come.

You mean aliens? Like in Beasts Vs. Aliens?
They're disgusting.

Loser.

Go away.

What are you going to do?
Bite me like a girl?

If I bite you, they'll
send me back, retard.

Who you calling a retard?

Don't make me use the Volcan death
grip on you. - You kidding me?

Hey, there's camp!
[Excited chatter]

This place has a pool?

Here they come.
Here they come.


Redford!
Hey, good to see you.

Hi!
Hi, are you Bella? I'm Bridgett!

Can we go swimming?
[Laughs] Yes!

I've been missing you.
I've been missing you so much!

Bella!
Elizabeth!


Are they sisters?
Yes. Different foster homes.

[Sighs] - They only
get to see each other at camp.

Hi.
Are you Maribel?

Uh, yeah.

I'm your counselor, Lacee.

That's why I have this sign
with your name on it, silly.

Oh, yeah!
Silly!

Let's go get you unpacked.

Are you ready to have
a great week? Yeah, come on!

How was the bus ride over?
Was it fun?

Hey, what's your name.

Eli.

Hey Ken.

Ken, this is your camper.

Yo, kid!
What's up, my man?

Screw you.

What the hell was that?

Looks like
you got a runner, soldier.

Is anybody going to do anything?

We're wondering
the same thing about you.

Pick it up, double time!

Hey, kid!

Hey. Honey, come on.
Let's get off the bus.

Where are we?

Honey, we're at camp.

What is that?

They must not have told
her where she was going.

Oh.

Sweetheart,
you don't have to be scared.

Camp is a place for kids
to have fun.

Come on.
I'll walk with you.

Come on,
let's go have some fun, okay?

He might be trying
to contact the mothership.

I don't think so, Red.


Hey, get down from there.

Come on!

Hey! Kid, you can't just
run off like that, okay?

I'm your counselor, do you
know what that means?

It means you have to listen to
me and do what I say, okay?

Alright, let's go unpack.

Kid, do you understand me?

I have a name.

Everyone has a name.
So?

I hate you.

Look you're really starting
to push it, okay? - Hey, Eli.

I'm Samuel.
This is my buddy Redford.

Redford's been up here,
what, like uh, 3 times now, Red?

Yes, sir.

Tell you what,
we can go unpack now, or

we can go see the stump first
and unpack later.

The stump?
Really? Sweet!

What do you say soldier?

Fine, whatever.

Come on.

Here,
camper's have been writing

their names on it
for over 25 years.

My name's on it 3 times.

One for every year
I've been to camp.

Isn't it awesome?

I wouldn't go straight to awesome.

You can tell how old it is
by counting the rings.

There's this thick one up here.

Probably from when
the tree got burnt

from the second invasion
from Talus Prime.

You're weird.

Thanks!

Hey guys,
I see you found the stump.

And you must be Eli.

Welcome to camp.
You going to sign your name?

My counselor says
my name isn't important.

Okay.
Hey Redford, nice to have you back.

How has your year been?

Sad to report, no word
from the mothership yet.

[Singing: Peace Like A River]

â™ª I've got joy like a fountain â™ª

â™ª I've got joy like a mountain
in my soul â™ª

â™ª In my soul â™ª

â™ª I've got love like a mountain
I've got love like a mountain â™ª

â™ª I've got love like a mountain
in my soul â™ª


Lame. - What are you
talking about kid?

That is quality entertainment.

Awe, thanks you guys.
Hey, we're going to be doing

a lot of singing this week
so I hope you're ready.


Remind me to tell you a story
about this guy

who was taken from his family.

He was in and out of prison

but God had a
special plan for his life.

And he ended up working for
the King of Egypt. [Woah]

I was taken from my sister.

My dad's in prison.

Is this the Joseph in the bible?

I think we have some
announcements right now.

So, would you guys
help me welcome

Ms. Tammie,
our fabulous camp director?


First the rules.
[Awes]

Oh, we only have two.

Be safe, and have fun!

[British accent]
And please do come to my tea party.

Tea parties are for girls.

Well, then I guess the girls are going
to get all the cookies.

Samuel, how are we going to get cookies?
We'll work something out.

Oh, and a reminder, the variety show.
I want to see all your talents on the stage.

Stupid kids. They don't have talent.
Hey, be nice.

I think, um,
I think that's it, right?

The pool!
Swimming!

Swimming!
Pool! Pool!

What?
I, I can't hear you.

The pool, that sounds like fun.
Lame.

You're joking, right?

Oh! Okay.
Swimming!

Yeah,
Lifeguard Pete and I

decided there's not going to be
any swimming this year.


What do you think Lifeguard Pete?

Hmm.

Go to your cabins
and put your suits on!

The pool is open!

Let's go guys!


Hang on Redford, I got your
sunscreen right here buddy.

Alien snot, sweet! Doubles as a shield
against photon rays. Let's go!

Did you forget your swimsuit, stupid?

No!

I just don't want to swim.

What's your problem?
You don't know how to swim?

I can swim. - What are you?
Afraid of the water? Little chicken.

Shut up!

Bock! Bock! Bock!

Shut up!

I know why you really don't
want to go swimming.

That's enough, Amigo.
Come on, let's hit the pool.

Sissy!
Turd!

Look kid, it's alright that you're afraid
of the water. I was just teasing you.

I told you I'm not afraid of water.
Stop saying I'm.

What's your problem?

You.

Funny.

Find your swim trunks, let's go.
Don't touch me!

Woah, woah.

Look,

all the other kids, are down
at the pool having a good time.

Don't want to miss out
on that do you?

Go to hell.

Get your swim suit on now
and let's go. - [Spits]

You serious kid?

Alright guys listen up.
There's only one way to get this arm band.

You have to swim all the way across the
deep end without any help whatsoever.

So, who's going to be the few,
the brave?

Who's going to join the ranks of
Pete's Ultimate Camp Swim Club?

You can do this.

I'm not sure.

I will be cheering for you
the whole way.

But what if I don't make it?
You totally will.

You are so strong
and I will be waiting for you

on the other side
when you finish.


Ready?

You're not going to let me drown,
are you?

Not in my pool.

Now, on the count of three.

Okay Bella.

Ready?
One.

Two. Three. Yeah!

Go Bella!
Come on Bella!

You can do it.
You can do it.

Yes! Yes!
Yay Bella!

Welcome to Pete's Ultimate
Camp Swim Club! [Cheering]

I've never won anything before.

I'm so proud of you!

You got it girl!

Hey Ken.

Hey.

For the free planets of the
delta quadrant! [Splash]

Oh my gosh!


You got it.

I almost made it.

Just keep working on it with Samuel.
You'll get it.

Where's Eli?
I told him to stay at the cabin.

What?
You left him alone?

The kid spit on me,
okay?

Whatever.


There you are.

Okay, the three of us
need to have a talk. - Fantastic.

Someone here needs to apologize.

It's me.

I really wanted you to come to camp, Eli,
but we were short a counselor.

So, Ken, even though he doesn't know
how to be a good counselor,

he came up to fill in.

It's okay,
I always get screwed.

Okay.
So how about this?

No spitting,
stick together,

and camp will be great!

Fine.

I hear there's
a kickball game happening.

Why don't you two go down
and play before dinner?

Don't leave him alone again.

get on base buddy! Let's go!

Who's up? Oh, I think it's me!

Kick that sucker to Zenith!


Nice!

[Claps - Cheering]

Eli, you're up!
Eli's up!

Alright Eli, come on!

Out!
What the hell, I was safe!

Sorry Eli,
you were out.

Come on, it's no big deal.
You were out.

Figures you would take their side.
Who's counselor are you anyway?

Get off the field, kid.

I told you, you were out.
Even your counselor says so.



I'm going to count to five
and you better be down here.

Do you understand me?

I know how to count to five.

Well alright then. Here we go.
One.

Two.

Three.

Four.
Five!

Fine! Stay up there. See if I care.
I got all night.


Hey soldier.

Serellian wamba beast liver!
Yes! I'm starved!

Kid, you can't run off
like that, okay?

I was hungry.

Wow! You swam all the way
across the deep end?

Isn't she awesome?

Hey,
I want one of those.

Sorry kid.

Only brave little boys who can swim
and obey their counselor get one.

Hey, maybe you should
trade your phone in for one.

You know, the one
you've been texting on all day?

Give it up, kid.

Come on, get me one! What kind
of a stupid counselor are you?

Look, you want an arm band?
You have to swim, okay?

[Under his breath] Can't believe I have to put
up with this food for the next four days.

Bon appetite!

They look like alien brains and fingers
mushed up all together!

That's disgusting.

Can I have some?
[Laughs]

Did you look through your other bag?
Like three times! Man, where is it?

[Door opens]

Hey Samuel, here to relieve you.
Jimbo.

Well, as soon as you guys get settled in
your bunks, we can start the story time.

Sweet!
Do you have any UFO stories?

Hey, kid, what's that whole
mess you're making up there?

Alien defense.
I don't want them

sneaking up
and sucking out my intestines.

I see.

Ready for a story now.

Here it is!
It's in Eli's bag, he took it!

Whatever,
you probably just put it there.

Why did you take it?
He's always taking stuff at Locustwood.


[Door opens - Groans]

Not again, man,
I'm getting tired.

Let's go soldier,
double time!

[Door closes]
Is it safe to come out yet?

[Reading] There we are, said
Mrs. Puddleduck, good as new.

the warm sunlight spill into the cozy room.

roses growing in the garden just below.

lovingly at Charlotte and said,

just come to me every day and let me
remind you how much I care.

Alright, story time is over.
Time for bed.

No, no!
I don't want to go to bed.

Can we read another story,
please?

No, we're going to have
a long day tomorrow.

You've got to get some sleep.
Come on, into bed!

I'm not tired, can we go
for a walk, Bridgett?

Uh.
Please?

You, almost fell asleep
on the ï¬‚oor, Bellie Boo,

and I can barely
keep my eyes open myself. Come on.

No, no! I don't want to go to bed.
Let's stay up, please, please!

It's okay. It's okay Bella.
Bella, it's okay.

Bella, you're safe here. You're okay.
Nothing is going to hurt you.

He'll come here too.
He will.

Uh, Bridgett, can you move
your bed next to hers?

Um, yeah.

How about that? Look, she's going to put
her bed right next to yours.

Look how close.
Better?

[Snifï¬‚es]

My magic blanket!

Magic blanket?

Almost forgot that I brought it.
Okay.

My great grandmother made it.

It's pretty.

Come here.

My grandma made this,
not only with stitches and cloth,

but with all of her love.
Here.

Read what it says.

Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

Guard me Jesus through the night
and wake me with the morning light.

You know, I don't really use it that
much anymore. You want to borrow it?

Really?
Mmm hmm.

It is magic.

Just leave me alone.
[Door closes]

I give up.

Ken, go!

These are the only shoes they sent Gabby
up with and they're two sizes too small.

I let her borrow my ï¬‚ip ï¬‚ops.

I'll have Pete go in to town
first thing. Size?

Five.

[Door opens]

So it begins.
Yeah.

Sam. - Randy took
Bryce's stuff over to Cabin five.

What'd the nurse say
about the bite?

Thankfully,
it didn't break the skin.

What about those two?
What are you thinking?

I hate to admit I was wrong.
I should have known.

Eli's social workers wanted us to
send him back if he got violent.

I'm going to have to
send them both back.

Give them one more day.

I can't risk the entire camp for them.
Look Sam, a lot can happen in a day.

[Door opens]
Then he runs again, yeah.

Yeah, I think she gave me the
worst kid here on purpose.

Hey, I got to go but as soon as you
get that meeting you let me know.

Okay? Alright, bye.

[Phone beeps]

So, how was your first day?

Thanks for the troubled kid.
What's wrong with him?

Nothing.

Nothing?

[Door opens - Door closes]

Is there anything here but junk food?
There's some apples in the fridge.

Excellent.

So, what's up with your freak kid?
Uh, Robert.

Redford.

Yeah, seriously?
What's that kid, like 10 years old?

He's already in some need
of serious therapy.

You know, I wonder if these kids here
wouldn't benefit more

from a bunch of psychos
rather than us. Right?

The first day can be pretty hard.

Yeah, no kidding!
My kid had me run probably

20 miles
around this place today.

It's going to take a month's worth
of chiropractic work to fix my neck.

Hey Randy, how long did you say
you've been doing this again?

Three years.

Glutton for punishment, huh?

You know, I thought
you had the worst kid, but

obviously Tammie
has it out for me.

You know what I thin...
Time to go!

Hey man, take it easy!

Don't "easy" me! Now you listen
and you listen good, maggot.

You may be good at making money
in your pretty little office

but, I have been
to hell and back.

I've killed in service and I've watched
my buddies bleed to death from IED's.

Camp, is a walk in the park compared
to war you non contributing zero.

When I think back to my army
days it gets me all worked up.

Believe me, when you're under fire
in a war zone

you think of the oddest things.

Wayne,

was the only person who
told me he loved me,

ever.

Wayne?

My counselor,

from this camp.

I was a mean,
violent, nasty kid.

Hated everyone,
especially Wayne.

Must have bit him
like 20 times.

And when I
left camp,

he told me he loved me.

And I spit on him
when I got on the bus.

Tried to find him
when I got out of the service.

He had died the year before.

Never got a chance to tell him

thanks for changing my life.

So, I don't care
if you don't like the food,

or me,

or camp.

You will figure out a way to be
a good counselor to that kid.

You get me?

Figure it out.

<i>[Dreaming] How many times do I have
to tell you to stay in your room?</i>

No mom, no!

Ken!

[Phone beeps]

[Dialling number]


<i>- Who the hell is calling me at 3am?</i>

Um, uh.

<i>- What do you want?</i>

Dad?

<i>- Eli? What are you doing?
Where are you?</i>

I'm at camp at Pine Lake.

<i>- Camp?
What are you doing at camp?</i>

I don't know.

They made me come here.

My counselor's awful
and the food is worse than Locustwood.

<i>- Alright, don't worry.
I'm coming to get you.</i>

No dad. Never mind,
I'm okay, I'm fi...

<i>- I said I'm coming to get you!</i>

No dad, no.
[Line goes dead]

What time is it?
Time to get up, princess.

Eek! Call that beauty sleep?
You might want to try something else.

Eli, rise and shine soldier!

Where's my phone?

You're not supposed
to have a phone.

Funny kid.
Have you seen it?

No.

Are you sure
you haven't seen it?

Oh, here it is.
I thought I plugged it in.

Check your messages later.
We've got to get moving.

Redford. If you don't get up we're not going
to make it to muddy creek before breakfast.

Muddy creek!
Crawdads!

That's right soldier. The early
bird gets the, Crawdad!

Does he really have to strip
right here in front of everyone?

Where else
is he going to change?

I'm not changing
till everyone leaves.

That might be a problem see, cause we
can't leave until you change clothes.

Seriously kid, we're all boys. It doesn't
matter if we see each other in our underwear.

Eli, come on.

Hold on a second, Sam.

What do you think?

Fine, whatever.

Alright then. Hurry up.
Come on, find your pants.

All the good fishing spots
are right out here.

There's gonna be some really great
crawdads right over there, okay?

If you're waiting for it to dry
it's going to be a long wait.

You find any leeches,
soldier, you let me know.

Leeches?
Seriously?

They'll be attached to your toes.

Leeches, great.

That's what I'm talking about.

See this crawdad, they look like these
creatures I've seen on my home planet.

This is your home planet,
stupid.

No it isn't.
I'm from Zenith.

Don't call me a liar.

Mm, mm, mm. You've insulted
Zenithians for the last time!

Hey, come on guys.

Woah, woah, woah!



Good one, Ken!

I like the new look!

Oh, you haven't heard?

Mud does good things for your complexion.
Come on down, I'll show you.

No, no. Thanks, I'm good.
Are the crawdads biting?

Oh yeah, they're definitely
some kind of alien creatures.

They like raw meat.
[Nom, nom, nom]


Oh bacon!
I've never seen so much bacon!

So, Bella and I are going to go
to aunt Tammie's tea party.

What do you think kid?
Want to join them?

What?

The tea party's for girls.
Right.

Eli, want to go swimming today?

I already told you, no swimming.

Hey, the water's not
going to hurt you.

Besides, you know,
it's hot out. Take a dip in th...

No swimming, okay?

Okay.

Okay, mister party pooper.

We'll just stay in the cabin
all day and do nothing.

Sound fun?

[Phone beeps]

Tum it off, put it away,
keep it away.

Look, I've got an important
prospective client.

It could be worth a lot,
so...

Okay. Well,
remember Eli, your camper?

He's important too.

I know.

I'm aware I suck at this, okay,
but I'm trying to do better today.

We did the whole
get in the mud thing.

You're mean to him.

He's mean to me.

He's ten!
So!

Put the phone away
and maybe

you'll be able
to keep track of your camper.


Remember? We've got to
stick together, alright?

[Cheers - Splashes]

Sure sounds like the kids are having
fun over there at the pool, huh?

You know,
I used to be a lifeguard.

It would be like you had
your own personal,

lifeguard.

I told you,
I'm not afraid of water.

Well you know what, that's sure
what it sounds like to me, kid.

I'm not a liar!
I hate you!

Here, let me help you.

No, no, no, not like that.
Can't you ju...

I've just never done it before.
It's not that hard.

Can't you just take
the arrow and pu...

I've never done it before.
Neither have these kids either, okay?

You know what,
just forget it!


Wow!
I want to ride the bikes!

We can ride the bikes.
Let's go check it out.

No we can't.

Sure we can.
There's plenty left.

Look, there's a purple one right there, you
want that one? It looks about your size.

I don't know how.

What do you mean?

They said
I'm too fat to ride one.

Gabby,
do you know what today is?

What?

Today's the day you're gonna
learn how to ride a bike!

Really?

Uh huh!
Let's go!

Can we grab that one please?

Alright, come on.

Got it?

Alright, you got this.

Gabby. You okay?


Gabby!

I'm okay!
Oh, good.

Can I try again?
Of course you can, come on!

Look,

kid. I didn't mean t...
Whatever, okay?

Okay, okay. You don't want to swim,
you don't like archery,

you don't want to go to the tea party.
What would you like to do instead?

Shoot, anything.
I'm up for it, tell me.

I want to go
to the other side of the lake.

I don't think
they allow that, kid.

Why don't we do something
back here at camp, okay?

Figures.
You said it but you don't mean it.

That's not fair and you know I...

You said it!

You just lie
like everyone else.

We should go back to the cabin now.

Look what I got!
Made from alien skin.

Pretty sure he swallowed
half the pool, but he made it!

Hey, let me see that.

No, it's mine!
Hey.

That's not a nice way to
treat a fellow soldier.

Can we just go back to the cabin now?
I hate it here.

Back to the cabin.

Figures, I get the kid that wants
to do something we can't even do.

He wants to hike a mile away.

Where?

Come on. Looks like we're
going for a hike now.

Ugh!

Why don't you try to talk to him?

Yeah, I don't really feel like going for
a hundred yard dash again,

but thanks.

Why do you think he runs?
Because he likes being a pain?

Try again, soldier.

Man, all I know is
he's testing my patience.

He is testing you

to see if you give
a damn,

because no one else does.

How's it going?

I just want to get away
from that stupid camp.

Yeah, no kidding.

Think you're right about the tea party,
that would be pretty lame.

Sounds lame. What do they
even do there anyway?

I don't know.
We'd have to go to find out.

They do have treats though.

Yeah, but you've got to dress up.
Girl stuff.

It sucks
not having an arm band.

Yup,
gotta get into that pool.

You know, you could really get me
one if you wanted to. You suck.

Hopeless.

You know what, kid?
[Thunder cracks]

Come on.
Up.

Finally! The mothership
has come back for me!

Take me home!
Take me home!

Take me home!
[Thunder cracks]

These mountain storms
pass quickly.

It'll be sunny again tomorrow.

That's the closest
the mothership has come yet.

Sucks, huh soldier?

They'll come back for me,
someday.

Why don't we check our mail?

Hey,
did I get a letter from my dad?

Got something here
from Tammie for you.

No thanks.

Alright, here you go Bella.

Here you go Maribel.

You can open those, Maribel.

I'm saving them.

You'll get more tomorrow,
go ahead and read them.

I don't like reading.

Don't like reading?
Uh.

Everyone likes
reading their letters.

Lacee.

Maybe she's not that good at it.

What?

Reading.

Oh.

Maribel, can we talk?

What grade are you in
at school, sweetie?

My mom, my mom didn't
like taking me to school.

I have an idea, can I
read your letters to you?

"Dear Maribel, You rocked it
on the kickball field today soldier.

You can be on my team anytime.
Sergeant Sam."

Read this one.
Okay.

"Dear Maribel, You are so much fun
to hang out with here at camp.

Tomorrow,
we get to do the tea party."


"You are going to be so beautiful
in one of the dresses.

I can't wait to see
which one you pick.

I'm so lucky to have you
as a camper this week."

You wrote that one!

Yeah, I did. Do you want
to read more? -Yeah.

Red, turn that thing off
and go to sleep soldier.

I can't find my alien band.
You're not supposed to take it off.

It was itchy.

Here it is!

No, uh, wait!

That one's not yours.
I found it.

What do you mean you found it?

Wait a minute.

You took my alien band
because it's made of alien skin

and you want to be
an alien, like me. Admit it.

Look, there's no such
things as aliens you freak.

Guys!

No mothership, no Zenith,
and we eat spaghetti for lunch,

not alien guts.
No one is ever coming for you.

Never, ever, ever.

Ow!

Hey, what are you doing?
Huh?

Hold this, sweetie.

How do you feel?

I've had worse.

Well, you certainly took it like a champ.

Samuel, is it true?

What's that?

The aliens aren't coming for me.

Hey, you don't give up hope, you hear me?
Don't give up hope.

You and these stupid arm bands. Why
can't you stop taking what's not yours?

I didn't.

Oh really? Well somehow it magically
ended up on your bed then. I wonder how.

Nothing to say huh?
Yeah, figures.

You know, with all your running away
and stealing things,

you're making me look like
a bad counselor.

That's because
you are a bad counselor.

No, you know what?
You are bad, you.

[Door slams]


Let me exp...
Just wait here.

So when do I go back?

We can't have kids
beating other kids up.

You understand?

Ken hasn't been
the best counselor, huh?

Ken's the worst counselor ever.

Okay.

Tell you what,

I'll give you a second chance

if you think you can give Ken
a second chance.

Okay.

Good. Come on,
get in bed. Up.

Up, up, up.

Ms. Tammie.

Yup?

Will you tell Redford
I'm sorry.

I will.
Goodnight Eli.

[Phone beeps]

Well, when's he going back?
What?

When is he going home?
Shh! Ken.

Is that what you want?

Tammie, If we're not careful
I may end up gett...

we may end up getting sued
by Redford's parents.

What parents Ken? His dead mom
or his drug dealer dad?

You know, look. You can't just throw out
right and wrong okay?

The kid has broken every single rule
and there need to be consequences.

In Eli's world, right and wrong,
they tend to get a little bit muddled.

And if the adults in his life can't tell
the difference, how can we expect him to?

Alright so forgive me if I have a
little bit of compassion here.

But please, don't you worry.

Nobody's going to complain
that Eli's counselor doesn't give a care.

I'm trying to care,
Tammie.

But that kid
is totally screwed up.

I can't do this.

I mean,

how do you like
a kid like that?

You just have to find
one thing to like.

Just one thing.

And pray for him.
[Scoffs]

All these kids
could use our prayers.

Alright, okay.

Well, for example,
there's one thing I like about you.

Really?

Porsche Carrera 4.
[Laughs]

330 horsepower, 0-60 in 5.2 seconds.
Be still my beating heart.

Nice. Girls don't like boys,
they like cars and money.

Okay,
goodnight Ken.

Goodnight.

And Joseph told his brothers,
who had sold him to be a slave,

that what they meant
for evil,

God used for good
for his entire family.

Amen.


Well, my friend Pete has an announcement
to make, so Pete, would you come on up.


Great news!
Yesterday at the pool,

four more campers joined
the hundred year tradition

of Pete's
Ultimate Camp Swim Club!!

[Applause and cheers]

So, if the club is 100 years old,
how old does that make you?


Please stand
and raise your bands high!

[Applause and cheers]

Way to go guys!
Really good!

Can you get me one of those arm bands?
You know I can't.

Buy one, steal one. You could do
it if you were a good counselor.


Come on, I want to show you something.
[Singing] - We can't just leave.

Who's going to stop us?

â™ª ... we like fun â™ª

â™ª It's great just knowing I'm a part of
God's family, playin' under the sun â™ª

This is your car?! No way!!
Yes way.

You wanna get in - Yes!
Come on, hop in, dude.

Whoa!

How did you get this?

Well, I didn't steal it, or trick someone.
I worked really hard for it.

If you want something bad enough,
you'll do almost anything for it.

You really want that wrist band, right?
Yea.

Look, I may be a lousy counselor,
but I'm a great swimmer.

And I can teach you to swim across
that pool faster than anybody.

But, I don't want to swim
Yeah, yeah, yeah

and you aren't afraid of water,
blah, blah blah.

We only have a few days left
here at camp

and it's going to take time for me
to teach you how to swim.

So what are we going to do?

Eli.

Let's be honest.

We don't really like each other
or get along too well, do we?

But there is one thing
I like about you, dude.

You're a fighter.
A real fighter.

And if you really want that wristband,
you're going to have to fight for it.

Whatever is keeping you out of
the water... you've got to fight it.

[Laughter and splashing]

Hey. Give me your towel.
Just go for it.

Hey.

On three we jump in
together, okay, Eli?

Okay.

One. Two. Three.


Come here. Come here.

Whoa!

[Splashing, laughing and yelling]


Fancy.

The tea party's this afternoon.
That's what I hear.

Did you know?

You know... um...
about Eli?

I try not to think about
their past too much.

I focus on a hopeful future.

[Door shutting]

Hey you!
You were awesome in the pool today!

I think you won,
like, every chicken fight?

Hey, why are you
wearing that dress?

[British accent]
Oh, I'm going to a tea party.

I know, I know,
it's just for girls.

Okay, well we are off.

Enjoy your tea party.
I shall.

Hey, do me a favour.

Hold on to this for me.

Come on!
Eli, wait up buddy!

We totally dominated that pool.
That was so awesome.

See,
I told you it would be fun.

How was I supposed to know?
First time in a pool.

Hey. Come on.
What do you want to do now?

Cookies do sound good right now.

I wish I didn't have to get
dressed up for that tea party.

[British accent] My lovelies, thank you
for coming to my tea party.

Welcome, welcome!

You all look beautiful! Bella, you look
absolutely smashing in that dress.

[British accent]
Why thank you Miss Tammie.

And those ï¬‚owers in your hat,
they are marvellous.

Why thank you for noticing. You
ladies all have such great manners.

The gardener just has...

We heard you had good tea?
A little birdie told us this is a black tie event.


Why, you look dashing!
Please sit, join us, join us!

Hello, ladies.


Ladies, let's have a toast,
shall we?

To our first gentlemen tea guests.
Now remember our manners.

When in doubt.
Pinkies out.

Cheers. - Cheers.

To the ladies.

Mmmm. Delicious.

So,

to what do we owe the pleasure
of your company?

Oh, we're here for the cookies.

Oh, please!
Yes.

All of them!

[Screaming and yelling]

Go! Go! Go!

Operation cookie rescue!
Leave no cookie behind!

All of them!
All of them! Let's go!

I'm going to get you, Redford!

[Screaming, yelling, laughing]

[Song: Life Like This by Logan Martin]
â™ª I'll take my time, safe and sound â™ª

Feast on the spoils of our ravages!

â™ª tried to turn it all around â™ª

â™ª Do you wanna laugh we're at,
try to fly our way apart â™ª

Who got the most girls? Who got
the most girls? - I think I did!

[Chatter - Laughter]

AHHH!

â™ª I'm just hanging by the rooms â™ª

â™ª Hell he's lucky
I never want to move â™ª


â™ª This is over, way too soon â™ª


â™ª I can't let you
how things are at  home â™ª

Hey, Miss Tammie.

â™ª Dance with you, going on â™ª

Way to go! Yeah! â™ª This is life from
now on I know it's time to move â™ª

â™ª This is over, way too soon â™ª


Whoa! - Whoa! â™ª This is life from
now on I know it's time to move â™ª

â™ª This is over, way too soon â™ª

Go on, kick your feet, kick your feet.
You got it, you got it!

â™ª Dance with you â™ª

You're doing it! Well done!
â™ª You know, I wanna be with you â™ª

Ladies, we have mail.

Bella, something for you.
Maribel.

You did a great job on the swim test.
Welcome to the club, Lifeguard Pete.

And we have one here
for Tammie from...

Porsche.

Who's Porsche?

Obviously Ken.

Ha, ha, ha. Well, I don't
know, but let's find out.

My heart throb, Tammie.


Let's go for a ride. We can ditch that
guy named Ken who normally drives me.

With all my horsepower,
Porsche.

Hey!

Gabby, let's hear one of yours.

Yeah!

Hey Gabby, I hear you're going to sing
for us tomorrow at the variety show.

So excited to hear your voice,
James.

You're singing in the show tomorrow?
Yeeees.

And it's going to be
awesome!

[Chatter - Laughter]

[Alien music]

[Pirate music]

my counselor is cool! â™ª

[Ballet music]

Is it a 5 of diamonds?


[Hawaiian music]

â™ª He's got everyone there,
in his hands â™ª

â™ª He's got everyone,
everywhere in his hands â™ª

â™ª He's got the whole world
in his hands â™ª


What a great show! Do we
want to have some more fun?

Yes!

We have one more act and I'm pretty
sure you guys are going to love it.

You see, one of our
camp counselors this week

is actually
a very talented musician.

In fact,
he was in a real rock band.

Ken?

You were in a rock band?
A long time ago. Where did you get those?

Your mom donated them to the
church rummage sale, come on!

I didn't tell her she
could get rid of them!

Alright, come on you guys, you want
to hear some rock and roll or what?!

Yeah!

Ken! Ken! Ken!
Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!

Are you gonna play?

Sure looks that way.

Just promise not to run
away if I suck, alright?


Just pretend you're back
in high school. - Alright,

as long as you do the same.
Oh I will.

Wooooo.

Oh, hush up!

One, two, three four.

[Drumming and cheering]


Thank you, I love you,
thank you.

How did you get to be a drummer?

Well, umm...

okay.

So, I always wanted a drum set.
Ever since I was like, this big.

And, um, my parents didn't like the drums.
And I got really mad. At my dad, mostly.

And when I was twelve.
My dad,

he died.

I never met my parents.

My dad's in prison.

Life doesn't always work out the
way it should, I guess, huh?

But, before my dad died, he did get me
these drums as my birthday present.

That is a sweet birthday present.

Yeah, they're pretty cool, right?

For a while, I was angry
at my dad for dying.

I played the drums a lot then.

I practiced to much
the neighbours actually

called the cops on me
for making too much noise.


I guess I was, uh, trying to
prove something. To myself.

To my dad.

My father never told me
he loved me.

But he got me these drums.

Right?

Well, enough out of me.

Hey,
you guys ready to rock?!

Yeah!

[Drumming and cheering]

You really got these
for your birthday?

Yep.

I hope
I get a birthday present someday.

What do you mean you never
got a birthday present before?

My mom said
I never deserved one.

Wow, um.

That's lame.

Tell me about it.

Why are you here?

Well, um.
It's cause of her, huh?

Who's her?
Tammie.

Oh, that her.

She's a severe hottie.

You think so?

Out of your league.

Yeah, you're probably right.
Hell, yeah, I'm right!

You know, um...

it's not important
why I'm here.

What matters...

What?

What matters is that I'd be
your counselor any day.

Hey you wanna try these out?
Really?

Yeah, take the sticks.

It's real easy. You cross
our right hand over your left hand.

Okay,
here you go.

One, two. One, one, two.
Take a stab at it.

Not bad, man.
Not bad.

You know my mom is dead?

Like your dad?

No, I didn't know that.

She was the meanest person.

She never let me go out
of my room.

She wanted to be
with her boyfriends.

She made me hide
when they came over.

She didn't like it when I talked
to other kids. She hated me.

Well, I hate you mom,
I hate you!

Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

Hey it's okay.

He's uh,
he's just a little upset.

Hey Eli.

The other kids are making s'mores.
Wanna come get some?

What are s'mores?

[British accent] - Oh they're just
the most delicious dessert.

All marshmallows
and chocolate all melted together.

They're really quite exquisite.

Sure.
Come on.

Yeah, yeah,
go on, go on.

I wanna go
for the armband tomorrow.

Yeah.

You're gonna get it.

No problem.

I..., I have to help out
with the s'mores, but um,

this is for Porsche.

[NO dialogues]

Are we gonna get in
trouble being out here?

I won't tell if you don't.


So, you were pretty obsessed
with me in high school, huh?


I mean you did buy my
old drums from my mom.

Your mom donated them!

You kept them.

Well I did like your band.

Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what
you thought of me that night!

I should have been ï¬‚attered, I..., why did you
ask me out on stage? In front of everybody?

Okay, because my friend
dared me to do that.

Yeah, and you could have let me down
a little bit, you know, smoother.

Yeah, that wasn't one of my
classier moments, was it?

Well, I do hope that me
giving you are ride in my car tonight

helps to sooth some of those
high school wounds.

It doesn't.

You want me to tell you what does?
Yeah, please do.

You teaching Eli how to swim.

He really likes you.

So what happens next?

You mean when he goes back
to his world

and we go back to ours?

Yeah. No.
It's hard.

So what do you do?

I pray that God
will watch over them.

Yeah. Not me.

Not you?

I prayed.
When I was a kid.

I asked Him for things.

And he didn't answer?

No, no.
He answered.

He let my dad die.

He didn't save him from cancer.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, I haven't talked
to God much since then.

God can love us no matter
what our situation.

That means, it's whether
we can feel it, or not.

And that's what
you tell these kids here?

I hope you're right about Him.

Me too.

Do you want
to get into some more trouble?

Come on.

Hey Roy!

This isn't what it looks like.

Yes it is!

I don't even want to know.



Keep kicking!

Come on Eli!

Yeah!

You did it! You did it, Eli!
That was amazing!

I thought I wasn't going to make it.

I'm so proud of you, kid.
Really.

See, you're a real fighter.

Dad?
Hey!

Get your hands of my kid.

Who's this guy
and wha...

Get your damn hands
off my kid!

No, dad,
I didn't mean for you to come.

Shut up boy, you called me.
I'm taking you home.

Bonnie, get the kids out of here, now!

Let's get him to the nurses station.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Keep touching him
and I'll kill you!

Shut up, dad!
Shut up!

Somebody call the cops.

Get off me!

Hey Jenny.

What's going on here?
What happened?

His father showed up.

Hey.
You okay Eli?

Just leave me alone.

You don't have to be embar...
Just leave, just leave.

Okay, buddy.
I'll be outside, alright?

It's going to hurt a little bit, okay?

Anybody want to tell me
what that was about?

He's pushing you away.
What?

We're friends.
I mean...,

I don't get it.

I have to call Locustwood.

I wanna know, how did he
even know he was here?

I don't think it was Locustwood.
What do you mean?

He said something about Eli calling him.

Eli can't call him.
Eli doesn't have access to a...

Three thirty in the morning?

Do you know this number?

No, no I don't know
that number.

See, this is why we don't
allow cell phones here.

Huh, how do you know
Tammie's aunt?

What are you talking about?

Margaret Summerfield.

You've got a bunch
of missed calls from her.

She's a huge financial
supporter of our camp.

Why is my aunt calling you?

She's umm... she's been in the market
for a new financial advisor,

and I found out that she's...

No. No, just...

Tammie, Tammie.

Hey. Hey. Wait a minute.
Let me expla...

Are you serious?! That's why
you wanted to come to camp?

You used me. You used these kids.
For my great aunt's money?

Look, I did not come to camp initially...

Well,
it looked worse than it was.

No stitches
so he should be good to go.

Hey buddy, look.
You got your arm band.

It's your fault!

Go follow him!

No.

No.

This isn't right.

What did you expect, huh?

That years of pain would somehow
magically disappear in a week.

That you could fix him
in a couple of days?

So your just going to
give up on him now, huh?

Great.

My fish is going to be bigger
than your entire head.

It's going to jump out of the boat.
Mine's going to be bigger.

Ours is going to be bigger.
[Engine revs]

Come on.

Hey, look who made dinner.

Where's Ken?

We haven't seen him.

Good.

We'll keep an eye on him.

Hey sweetie,
you don't want to lose this.

Eli.
You want something to eat?

Look, Eli, Bothean tree worms.
Delicious and nutritious.

Shut up, freak.

Do you want to do anything, Eli?
It's our last activity for the week.

No.

Crawdads, canoes?
What do you say, soldier?

I wish I never came.

Come on, chin up.

[Truck backing up beep]

Camp Pine Lake, are you
ready to have a party?

Because my friend Eli's never
had a birthday party before

and I thought today would be
a great day to celebrate it.

What do you think?


You came back?

Happy Birthday, Eli.

It's my birthday?
It's my birthday party!

Hey Red,
this is my birthday party!

And what would a birthday party be
without presents?

Presents?

Here's one for you, Luke.

Oh, wait,
and here's one for Bella.

Yayl!

And Redford
Sweet!

And for Gabby...

A bicycle!

And for Jose.

Oh you know what?
Wait a second,

I think I have birthday presents here
for everybody!


And something
extra special for Eli.

They go with the drums.

Drums?
Are you serious?

[Song: Sun Sunny Sun
by Sarah Hart]

Happy birthday, buddy.
Happy Birthday.

[Cheering, laughing, party sounds]

0h yeah!

â™ª Sun sunny sun â™ª

â™ª Chase all your clouds away,
come out to play oh sun â™ª

â™ª Sunny sun,
come out and smile for everyone â™ª

â™ª Sun sunny sun â™ª


â™ª Maybe the grace is fading away,
its blue skies from your heart â™ª

â™ª Sun sunny sun â™ª


â™ª Sun sunny sun â™ª

â™ª Chase all the clouds away,
come out to play â™ª

â™ª Oh sun, sunny sun,
come out and smile for everyone â™ª

â™ª Sun sunny sun â™ª

It's been a pleasure serving
with you this week, soldier.

Feels a lot longer than that.

Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

They've had more than enough
of that in their lives.

Oh, and uh.

Bring your shades.

Well, I guess
I can't put this off forever.

Don't cry, soldier. The mother ship will
come soon and I'll be able to go back home.

Hey, Mandie?
Yeah?

I think I forgot to be sad this week.

That's good!
That's so good.

Here. Bridget helped me
write this letter for you.

Hey kid.

You okay?

No.

Am I going to see you?
After I leave this place?

Uh. I don't know.

Can you promise me we'll
see each other again?

I can promise you one thing.

I'll never forget you.

I love you, Eli.

I'm going to ask God to watch out for you.
You understand?

Okay kids, on to the bus.

Okay,

get on the bus.

[Saying goodbyes]

Bye sweetheart!

Keep your head up!

Bye guys!
We love you.

I love you, Bella!

Bye!

You miss Lacee, huh?

It's okay,
where are you going?

West County Home
for Girls.

I've been there once.
It's not so bad.

They have a really nice playground.

It's okay.
Here, take this.

You'll get your own next year,
but until then, you can borrow mine.

Thanks.

We had the best counselors.

My favourite part of camp was
when we got caught in the rain.

What was yours?

The drums.

That was sweet too.

Hey Red?
Yeah?

Tell me about your home planet.

Well,
I come from the Planet Zenith

where everything's made of gold
and everyone is purple.

The diameter of the planet
is 63 miles by 63 miles.

If you think about it, it's like...

Hey.
Hey.

So the counselors bus
is getting ready to leave

and I still have
some cleaning up to do.

Would you mind giving me
a lift off the mountain?

You did really great this week.

Seriously, thanks for coming.

Tell me.

Well, I've started
talking to God again.

And, I've been asking Him why
He lets them suffer like this.

I ask the same thing
all the time.

And?

And I don't know. I mean maybe
He can use the suffering for good.

Like he used Jesus' suffering
to help all of us.

And that makes you feel better?

No.
But it gives me hope.

Well, I was hoping for
a little bit more than hope.

It's hard to go back.

Yep.

For the whole week, I couldn't wait
to go back to my real life, you know?

And uh,

now I... feel like

my real life is fake,
and camp is real.

Kinda weird.

Man, that kid could run.
You know? He could run.

Will I ever see Eli again?

Pray for him.

[Door buzzing]

Not quite so intimidating
when I'm sober, huh?

Eli writes me letters.

Talks a lot about...

camp and...

his counselor.

When you become a dad,
you uh...

The thing is, I...

The only example I had
was my dad,

and he didn't exactly
help me out. You know?

Hey, it's okay.

No, it's not okay.

It's not okay!

I'm a failure as a father!

Eli's going to have
no dad to help him out.

He's going to get screwed
just like I got screwed.

I talked to my attorney.

He wrote this up.

I know it's...
it's a lot to ask.

Eli doesn't have a lot of options.

Working with real family kids
is not

like a typical

camp.

A lot of these children feel

like they are in the way.
They feel, like they are not important.

They don't have anything to their name.

I'm sorry.

Like they show up
with a trash bag

of shoes
and cloths that don't fit them.

I saw where

hair had been pulled out of uh,
their head.

We have had kids here
that had cigarette burns on them.

We have had kids that been abused
the worse way you ever can imagine.

And I'm very angry with the adults
that put them in that position.

A group of incredible people
spend a week with them,

providing
healing and hope,

as well as
great memories,

for a
young child.

Being in foster care
uh,

sometimes
builds up a lot of anger.

Um...,
I was a biter.

And, uh,
anytime another kid would

um...,
mess with me

or tick me off,
you know

I just go grab them
and bite them.

She was worried about uh,
someone coming in

and she's like
hey someone is coming in.

In the cabin, someone is coming
into the cabin and I can't go to sleep.

It was a quilted blanket actually
from my grandmother I had with me.

And, I gave it to her and I was like
here take this blanket

you can sleep with it.
You know, a week long.

And it has like
this special stitching on it

it's like super secret.

Like a super secret blanket
that keeps you invisible

and no one can touch you.
It protects you when you are asleep.

And she is like, okay.
And she like slept with the blanket

for like
the entire week.

And, uh,
she then even,

she went to sleep pretty easily
like for most of the nights.

I said, James, what you want?
What can I do, to help you?

I was pretty
out of patience by then.

He just said,
I won't my dad to get out of jail.

And started crying.
And um,

And um, I have, you know
my father actually was an alcoholic.

We hugged
and we cried together.

And we prayed
for our fathers together.

And as we walking up
to the dining comments

I was complaining to my wife
that I did not want to be on a camp

for abused children
on my birthday.

And from behind us
I heard this little guy speak up

and he said:
I never have had a birthday.

What you mean you never had
a birthday. I mean,

it was so,

it was so much a given,
you know, in my life.

So I ran into town,

uh, to, to the Kmart here
and I got him a watch.

And my wife said just, you know that,
it literally changed Royal Family forever.

She said I wonder
how many other kids here

don't experienced
a birthday party.

And we found out,
none of the children,

none of the kids
we took to camp that year

had ever had
a birtday party.

And this counselor says: okay,
George wants to go

do the swimt est.
And he is doing his dog peddling

kicking like crazy. Everyone in
the pool area is cheering him on.

There was so much screaming...
Just screaming 'Go George, go George',

 'Go George', it was like he just got
a gold medal it the Olympics.

Okay,
he gets his band,

and it's just,
it's like, his.

The best treasure
he could ever have.

He worked with this counselor
to be,

to be able to do that,
to archive that.

Lot of kids don't,
they come to our camp

they don't get
that positive reinforcement.

I have never seen the boys
eat more bacon

at any other place in the word
than on a Royal Family kids camp,

it's disgusting.

They will,

they will pile their plate up with bacon
and they will consume

the whole plate.

I said well that's dangerous,
yep, it probably is.

She couldn't read,
uh,

she hadn't been to school,
she wasn't in school.

So, I would sit there with her
each night and read her,

her letters and stuff,
and, uh,

you know, and I saw her face like,
as I was reading him to her

she is like balance
for me.

And I was like,
yeah, balance for me

She said can someone else help me
because I want to write you something

and she actually took all the time
and effort to sit there and write out

you know, thank you for being
my camp counselor, I'm going miss you

see you, and I had
a great time at camp.

I cried the whole way home.
And, uh,

it's weird I haven't
remembered this

since last year.

So, um...,

I got home,

and I told Jessica,
um...,

we have to,
we have to find this boy Michael.

We, we sat out a mentorship program
that we were able too.

We talked to him every week
and see him.

Trough that process we found out
he needed a home,

and was needing
to be adopted.

And it didn't take long
until we decided that

we needed to be that home
and adopted him.

Creating a safe place
for these kids for a week

it just be, who they are in love
them exactly where they are at

is probably the most powerful thing
we can do for them.

You feel like, you're poking
the devil in the eye.

Yeah,
that's what it's like.

Know what you are doing,
you punch them right in the nose.

That's what it's like,
you stand right up there

and you grab them by the throat
and punch them right on the nose.

That's what we do
every week.

Come to camp.
It's one week

and,

it can really make a difference
in the life of a child.

We asked ourselves:

have we done anything
that's been this hard ever in our life?

No.

So we sat around.
We cried out every tear we had.

We, uh,

we loved the children
to the best of our ability

as we went around the world
we all said

I don't think I can do it again.

And then someone said it:

'How can we not?'

Yeah.
How can we not do it again.

[Music orchestral]
