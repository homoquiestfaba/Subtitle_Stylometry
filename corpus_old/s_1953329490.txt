Never did eat your lunch, did ya?

I'd better
get back to the office.

These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

Why don't you call your boss and
tell him to take the afternoon off.

It's Friday, anyway.
Huh?

Yeah? What do I do
with my free afternoon?

Walk you to the airport and--

Laze around here a while longer.

Checking out time is 3:00 p.m.

Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in when you come in,

but when your time's up--

I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

I have to go.

I can come down next week.

No.

Not even just to see you,
have lunch? In public.

Oh, we can see each other.
We can have dinner.

But respectably.

In my house, with my mother's picture
on the mantel,

my sister helping me
to broil a steak for three.

I'd kinda like to
meet your sister.

She, um--

She look anything like you?

Sam.
No?

All right.

Marion, whenever possible
I want to see you,

and under any conditions,

even, uh, respectability.

You make respectability
sound so disrespectful.

No, I'm all for it.

Look, a couple years, I'll have
my father's debts paid off at the store.

And I told you, alimony stops as soon
as she gets married again.

Ohh. I haven't even been
married once yet.

Yeah, but when you do,
you'll swing.

So, let's get married.

You really wanna live
in a hardware store in Fairvale,
eat beans out of a can with me?

Oh?
Yeah, that'd be a lot of laughs.

Tell you what--
When I send my ex-wife her money,

you can lick the stamps.

I'll lick the stamps.

Marion, you wanna cut this off,

go out and find yourself someone
who's, uh, available?

I'm thinkin' of it.

Don't you go break my heart, now.

Don't miss your plane.

Hey, wait.
We can leave together, can't we?

I'm late, and you have
to put your shoes on.

Is Mr. Lowery
back from lunch yet?

He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris St. property.

You know, the oil lease man?
Right, right, right.

So, that's why he's late.

You getting a headache?

It'll pass.

Headaches are like resolutions..
You forget about 'em
as soon as they stop hurting.

You got aspirins?

I have something.
Not aspirins, but--

My mother's doctor gave these to me
on the day of my wedding.

Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

Any calls?

Oh, Teddy called me, and my mother
called to see if Teddy called.

And, oh, your sister called to say she'd
be going to Tucson to do some buying...

and she'd be gone
the whole weekend, and--

Whoo!

Hot as fresh milk.

You girls oughta get your boss
to turn on the air-conditioning.

He can afford it today.

Marion, will you get those copies
of the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

Of course.
Tomorrow's the day.

What a sweet little girl.

Not you, darlin'. My daughter.
Oh.

She's my baby, but tomorrow she stands
up there and gets married away from me.

Here, I'd like you
to have a look at my baby.

Eighteen years old,

and never known an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

Come on, Tom.
The air conditioner's on in my office.

You know what I do
with unhappiness?

I buy it off.

You unhappy?
Oh, not inordinately, no.

Oh.

I'm buyin' this house
as a wedding present for my baby.

Now, that's not buyin' happiness.

That's buyin' off unhappiness, see?

Yes, sir.

Four hundred thousand dollars, cash.

Not to worry, now.

I never carry more than I can afford
to lose. Count 'em up.

I declare!
I don't.

That's how I'm able to keep it.

Tom, uh, cash transactions of this size,
uh-- most irregular.

Yeah, well, so what?
It's my private money. Now it's yours.

Suppose we just
put this in the safe,

and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good--

Speaking of feeling good,
what happened to that bottle
you said you had in your desk?

Mmm.

You know, sometimes I can
keep my mouth shut.

Lowery, I'm dyin'
of thirst-a-roonie here.

I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

Put it the safe deposit box
at the bank.

We'll get him to give us
a check on Monday instead.
Okay.

Oh! Ahh.

He was flirting with you.

Guess he must have noticed
my wedding ring.

Uh-huh.

Lowery.

Come in.

The copies.
Thank you.

If you don't mind, I'd like to go
right on home after the bank.

l-I'm feeling a slight headache.
You go ahead on home.

Me and your boss are gonna go out and
get ourselves a little drinkin' done.

Of course.
Do you feel ill?

Oh, it's just--
just a little headache.

You need a weekend in Las Vegas.
Playground of the world.

I'm gonna spend the weekend in bed.
Thank you.

Only playground
to beat Las Vegas.

Mmm.

Marion, what--
what are you doin' up here?

Where in the world did you get
all that money?

Y eah. It's more than I need
to get out of debt.

So I said, "Sandy,

you see anything there you haven't
at least had a fifth of before?"

Sandy looks all up and down--

Sandy looks all up and down the bar,
and he says, "No."

5-27, you comin' in 10-1?

5-31, try again in your new location.

21-13, are you available
for check five duty?

Hold it right there.

In quite a hurry.
Y es.

I-I didn't intend
to sleep so long.

I almost had an accident last night
from, from, uh, sleepiness,

so I decided to pull over.

You slept here all night?
Y es.

As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open, so--

There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've--

I mean, just to be safe.

I just pulled over.
Have I broken any laws?
No, ma'am.

Then I'm free to go?
Is anything wrong?

There's nothing wrong,

except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

Now, just a moment.

Turn your motor off, please.

May I see your license
and registration?

Why?
Please.

Have a nice day.

Hey, Larry!
How soon do you want this?

Pick up line one.

It's about time.

O.B.'s working on that.

Be with you in a second!

5-28, was that Victor-Charlie-Bravo?

5-28, 10-4.
Victor-Charlie-Bravo.

I'm in no mood for trouble.

What?

There's an old saying
that the first customer of the day...

is always the most trouble.

But I'm in no mood for it, so I'm gonna
treat you so fair and square...

you're not gonna have
one human reason--

Can I trade in my car
and take another?

You can do anything you have a mind to.
Bein' a woman, you will.

Is that yours?
Yes. Yes.

There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just--
Sick of the sight of it.

Well, have a look around, see if there's
anything that strikes your eye.

Meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

I was just about to make some coffee.
You want some--

No, I'm in a hurry. I just wanna make
the change and start--

A person ought not to be in a hurry,
but it's too nice a day to argue.

So, I'll just shoot your car
in the garage.

O.B.!

Y eah, boss?

What's up?
Can you take this one,
give it the once-over?

Sure. No problem.
I'll give it the standard.

Say, that's the one
I'd have picked for you myself.

How much?
Go ahead. Spin it around.

Oh, no, no, no.
No, it looks fine.

How much will it be
with my car?

You don't want the usual
day-and-a-half to think it over?
No.

You are in a hurry.
Somebody chasin' ya?
Well, of course not.

Please.

Well, that's the first time I ever saw
the customer high-pressure the salesman.

But I figure, uh, roughly,

your car plus...

four thousand?

Four thousand.
Four thousand.

Ah, you got time
to argue price, though, huh?

All right.
Four thousand dollars.

I take it, uh, you can prove that
that car is yours.

I mean, out of state license and all.
I have all the necessary papers.

ls-- Is there a ladies' room?
l-ln the building.

Thank you.

Hey!

Forgot your bag.

Put 'em in the back, please.

Heck, Officer, that was the first time
I ever saw the customer...

high-pressure the salesman.

Is somebody chasin' her?

I'd better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

She look like a bad one to you?
Acted like one.

Funny thing is,
she paid me in cash.

Y es, Mr. Lowery?

Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

Buzz me the minute she comes in.

Call her sister.
If no one's answering at the house--

I called her sister where she works--
Hard Core Vinyl Record Store.

She doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

Run out to the house.

She may be unable to answer the phone.

Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

No, I haven't
the faintest idea.

I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

She said she didn't feel well, wanted
to leave early and I said she could.

That was the last I saw--
Wait a minute.

I did see her some time later, driving.

Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

Quick.

Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $400,000.

I'll get it back,
and if any of it's missin'...

I'll replace it
with her fine, soft flesh.

I'll track her, never you doubt it.
Hold on, Cassidy.

A girl works for you for ten years,
you trust her.

It must be some kind of a mystery.
I can't--

Check with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her.

You still trust her?
Hot creepers, man.

She sat there while I dumped it out,
hardly even looked at it,

plannin', and even flirtin' with me.

You trust her.

Gee, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't hear you in all this rain.

Go on in, please.

It's a dirty night.
Do you have a vacancy?

Oh, we have 12, in fact.

Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies.

They moved away the highway.

Oh, I thought I had gotten
off the main road.
I knew you must've.

No one ever stops here anymore
unless they've done that.

Oh.

Ah, but it's no use
dwelling on our losses.

We just keep on lightin' the lights
and following the formalities.

Uh, and, uh,
your home address.

Town will do.

Los Angeles.

Cabin one.

It's closer, in case you want anything.
Right next to the office.

Oh, I want sleep more than
anything else. Except maybe food.

There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside Fairvale.

Am I that close to Fairvale?
Fifteen miles.

I'll get your bags for you.

Uh, it's stuffy in here.

Well, the mattress is soft,
and there's hangers in the closet,

and there's stationery
with "Bates Motel" written on it,

just in case you want to make
your friends back home envious.

Ah. Mmm.

And, um,

uh, the, uh--

Over there.

The bathroom.
Mm-hmm.

If you want anything at all just tap on
the wall, 'cause I'll be in the office.

Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Norman Bates.

You have something
that most girls don't have.
I have?

There's not a name for it, but it's
something that puts a person at ease.

Well, thank you again.

You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to that diner, are you?

No.
Would you do me a favor, then?

Would you have dinner with me?
I was just about to myself.

Nothing special.
Just sandwiches and milk.

But I'd like it if you came up
to the house.

I don't set a fancy table or anything,
but, uh, the kitchen's awful homey.

I'd like to.
All right.

Well, then you get settled in,
take off your wet shoes...

and I'll be back
as soon as it's ready...

with my trusty umbrella.

No, I tell you! No!

I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper.

By candlelight, I suppose,

in the cheap, erotic fashion
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

Mother, please!

And then what?

After supper, music?
Whispers?

Mother, she's just a stranger.

She's hungry,
and it's raining out.

"Mother, she was just a stranger."

As if men don't desire strangers.
As if--

Well, I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

Do you understand, boy?

Go on. Tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite
with my food or my son.

Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

Shut up! Shut up!

Shut up!

I've caused you
some trouble.

No, uh, Mother--
my mother--

Oh, what's the phrase?

She isn't quite herself today.

Well, you shouldn't
have bothered.

I-I really don't have that much
of an appetite.

Uh, I'm sorry.

I wish I could apologize
for other people.

Don't worry about it.

Well, as long as
you've fixed us supper,

we might as well eat it, huh?

It might be nicer and warmer...

in the office.

It's stopped raining.

Eating in an office is just...
too officious.

I have the parlor back here.

Sit down.

Thank you.

You're very kind.

Oh, it's all for you.

Go ahead.
I'm not hungry.

You eat like a bird.

You would know, of course.

Not really.

I hear that the expression
"eats like a bird" is really a falsity,

because birds really eat
a tremendous lot.

I don't really know
anything about birds.

My hobby is stuffing things.

You know-- taxidermy.

Yeah. Yeah, l-l-I guess
I'd rather stuff birds,

well, because I hate the look
of beasts when they're stuffed.

You know?

Foxes and chimps?

Some people even stuff dogs and cats.
I couldn't do that.

No, l-l-I think only birds
look well stuffed...

because, um, they're kind of passive
to begin with.

That's a strange hobby.
Curious.

It's uncommon too.

I imagine so.

It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really.

Uh, needles, thread, sawdust.

The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

A man should have a hobby.

Oh, it's more than a hobby.

A hobby's supposed to pass your time,
not fill it.

Is your time so empty?

No. I run the office.

Tend the cabins, grounds.

Do little errands
for my mother,

the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

Don't you go out
w-with friends?

Uh, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

You haven't had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

Only my share.

Where are you goin'?

I didn't mean to pry.

I'm looking for
a private island.

What are you running away from?

Why--
Why do you ask that?

No.

People never run away
from anything.

Rain didn't last long, did it?

You know what I think?

I think we're all in our private traps,
clamped in 'em.

We can never get out.

Oh, we scratch and claw,
but only at the air,

only at each other.

And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

I was born into mine.

But I don't mind it anymore.

Well, you should.
You should mind.

I do.

I just--
I say that I don't.

Y-You know, if anyone
ever spoke to me...

the way I heard--
the way she talked to you, l--

Sometimes when she
talks to me like that,

I feel like I could curse her out
and leave her forever.

Or at least defy her.

Well, but I know I can't.

She's ill.

She sounded strong.

Uh, no.
I mean, ill.

She had to raise me all by herself
after my father died.

I was only five.
Must've been quite a strain for her.

It's not like she had to go to work
or anything like that.

H-He left her a little money.

Anyway, um,

a few years ago
Mother met this man.

He talked her into
building this motel.

He could've talked her
into anything.

And when he died too,
it was just--

just too great of a shock for her.

And the way that he died--

I-I guess it's nothing you should be
talking about when you're eating.

But, anyway, uh,

it was just too great
of a loss for her...

and, you know,
she had nothin' left.

Except you.

Yeah.

A son's a poor substitute
for a lover.

Why don't you go away?

To a private island, like you?
No. No.

Not like me.
Just--

I couldn't do that.

Who'd take care of her?

She'd be all alone up there.

The fire'd go out.

It'd be cold and damp,

Iike a grave.

If you love someone,
you can't do that to 'em.

Even if you hate 'em.

Understand, l--

I don't hate her.

I hate what she's become.

I hate the illness.

Well, wouldn't it be better...

i-if y-- if you--

if you put her someplace or--

Do you mean an institution?

A madhouse?

People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

Put her in... someplace.

I'm sor--
I didn't mean to sound uncaring. I--

What do you know about caring?
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

The laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes studying you?

My mother, in there?

She's harmless.

She's as harmless as one
of these stuffed birds.

I am sorry, l--

I on-- I only felt l--

You felt what?
It seemed that she was--
she's hurting you.

I-- I meant well.

People always mean well.

They cluck their thick tongues
and they shake their heads...

and they suggest,
oh, so very delicately.

Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

I hate to think about it.
She needs me.

It's not as if she were a maniac
or a raving thing.

She just...

goes a little mad sometimes.

We all go a little mad sometimes.

Haven't you?

Y es.

Sometimes only one time
can be enough.

Thank you.

Oh, um--
Thank you, Norman?

Norman.

You're not goin' back
to your room already.

Oh, I'm very tired,

and I have a very long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

Really.

I stepped into
a private trap back there,

and I'd like to go and try
to pull myself out of it
before it's too late for me too.

Well, you sure you don't wanna stay
just a little while longer,

just for talk?

All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

I'll bring you some breakfast.
What time?

Very early.
Dawn.

All right,
Miss, um, uh--

Crane.

Crane.
That's it.

Good night.

Mother?

Oh, God!
Blood! Blood!

Blood, blood,
blood, blood,

blood, blood,
blood, blood.
