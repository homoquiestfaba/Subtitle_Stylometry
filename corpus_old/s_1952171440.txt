The countdown is under way here
at Edwards Air Force Base.

The new experimental rocket plane,
which was developed
by Altman Aerodynamics,

<i>is scheduled to launch tomorrow morning</i>
<i>at 7:30 Pacific Time.</i>

The four-man crew will be led
by a familiar face,

astronaut and civilian test pilot,
Steven Wagner.

<i>Wagner became a national hero</i>
<i>four years ago,</i>

<i>when he made</i>
<i>a courageous emergency landing</i>
<i>in the space shuttle during reentry.</i>

A national hero
in my very own living room.

But I'll never be a hero to you, will I?
You were once.

<i>[Steven]</i>
<i>Is this it?</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>TheJoanne Raphelson Story.</i>

You wanna read it?
You're Chapter Five.
How many chapters are there?

Fifteen.
Wow.
You've been a busy girl, Joanne.

And that's only Volume One.

You really went into detail?

My editor insisted on it.
The juicier, the better.

<i>That's why I called you, Steve.</i>
<i>I didn't want you to be surprised.</i>

I appreciate that, Joanne.

I really do.

So, has anyone seen this
new version yet?
Not yet.

When do you hand it in?
Next week.
I'm still proofreading it.

Cheers.

Oh.

An olive, a cherry and an onion?
What do you call this?

A Spacewalk.
It's my own recipe.

It's a good name.
I feel like I'm flying.

Oh.

So, do you wanna read it?
I plan to.
That's why I'm here.

But... I've changed my mind.
Oh.

Hell, I've been a test pilot
for 15 years.

I once landed a space shuttle
in the ocean.

I think I can handle
whatever's in Chapter Five.

So hand it in.
Hit me with your best shot.

Thank you, Steve.

Mmm.

<i>Sir, there's a rumor you might</i>
<i>be considering a run for Senate.</i>

I don't know.
I've been to Washington.
Look at you.

I think I'm a lot safer in outer space.
Damn, you're cute.

<i>After this mission,</i>
<i>I'm going to sit down</i>
<i>and review my options.</i>

<i>But I will say this: Lf I choose</i>
<i>to run for public o</i>ffic<i>e,</i>
<i>I'll treat it like any other mission.</i>

I will fully commit,
and I will win.

Failure is not an option.

<i># [Up-tempo Folk]</i>

<i>Hey, who's in charge here</i>

<i># It's a jungle out there</i>

Hello?
Miss Raphelson?

Miss Raphelson, I see your car.

Miss Raphelson?

[Gasps, Speaks Spanish]
Miss Raphelson!


Career Day.

What would I talk about?
Your career.

Your job.
Yeah.

Come on, Mr. Monk.
It would mean so much toJulie.

Yeah. L-I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

L-I can't speak in public.
See, that's not true.

Remember when I first started working
for you, and you made that list
of all your fears and phobias?

There were 103 things.
Public speaking wasn't one of them.

There were a couple of things
that I didn't mention.

I didn't want you to think I was weird.
Why don't you ask the captain?

Oh...
Whatever it is, thank you for asking,
but I can't do it.

<i>[Monk Coughing]</i>

The housekeeper has her own key.
She comes in every other week.

She found the body right here
couple hours ago.

Her name is, uh,
Joanne Raphelson, 36.

Former Vegas showgirl.
The coroner just took the body.

Said she's been dead for five days.
So that makes it, uh...

Two days...
Wednesday morning.
Wednesday?

Excuse me.
Why are we here?
She killed herself, right?

<i>Uh, maybe.</i>
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

I noticed a few things.
I wanted to run 'em by you.

<i>I found a letter from</i>
<i>a publisher in New York.</i>

She was about
to have a book published.

A memoir called
<i>Between the Sheets:</i>
<i>TheJoanne Raphelson Story.</i>

<i>"Between the</i>...<i>'"</i>

Oh, yeah, yeah.
I get it. I got it.

And a check for 50 grand,
which she has not deposited.

Pretty weird time
to hang yourself, huh?

Good work, sir.
You don't have to sound
so surprised, Randy.

Oh. I'm not surprised.
I'm awestruck.

Awestruck.
Well, don't be.
And that's an order.

You're ordering me not to be awestruck?
That's right. Stand over there,
and don't be awestruck.

Yes, sir.

Anything else?
Uh, yeah.
Looks like her computer's missing.

There's a power strip
with a surge protector,
a printer and no computer.

Excuse me, sir.

Sorry. I've never disobeyed
an order in my life.

It's really good work.
It's awesome.

Randy, why don't you go outside
and talk to the neighbors?

Yes, sir.
It's awesome.

So, am I right?
Something's not kosher.

It's her driver's license.

How tall you think that stool is?

Mmm, about 18 inches?

The rope's 7'6".

But according to her license,
she's only 5'5".

I'm 5'5".

Step up.

You're right.

It doesn't add up.

So, how long have you lived here?
Fifteen years.

Maybe 14.
You know what?
My old lady'd know that.

You can ask her when she gets back.
If she's sober.

Mmm. Hey, you want
one of these? Nectarines?

They're the perfect fruit.
There you go.
Oh. Okay.

Now, why is the garage door
open again?

Benny, what did I tell you about this?
I didn't open it.

Really? Well, then, who did?
Maybe Donna did it.

You ever think of that?
Your sister couldn't open up
a box of crayons.

She's six years old,
for cryin' out loud.

Mr. Cain, I just have
a few more questions.

How well did you know
Miss Raphelson?

Not as well as I wanted to,
if you get my drift.

Hey, she was hot.
What a waste.

Did she have any visitors last week?

Uh, say, Tuesday or Wednesday?
Mm-mmm. No.

Nobody. Nobody.
Not as far as I recall anyway.

Oh, for crying... Now the...
Hector's out!

Benny, could you go get
your dog, please?
Why should I?

Because you opened up the garage.

<i>Hey, smart guy,</i>
<i>this is a police o</i>ffic<i>er, right?</i>

I could have him lock you up.
You think about that.

How's it going?
Captain,
this is, uh, Darrell Cain.

Darrell Cain,
Captain, uh, Leland Stottlemeyer,
Natalie Teeger, Adrian Monk.

Hi.
<i>[Disher] Mr. Cain says he was home</i>
<i>last week, but he didn't see</i>...

Excuse me. That box
is addressed toJoanne Raphelson.

Yeah.
It was on her porch.

Well, I'd heard she died.
I figured it was up for grabs.

You can't just take mail
from somebody's porch.

Yeah, you can if it's fruit.

The law doesn't apply to fruit
because it's perishable.

Actually, sir,
the law does apply to fruit.

Are you eating one?
No.

I was just putting that back.
Captain, you wanted
to see her phone records.

Yeah.

No calls at all on Tuesday
or Monday?

The last call she made was
Saturday morning at 2:05 a.m.

[Line Ringing]
<i>[Whistling]</i>

Hello. This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco Police.

Who's this?

<i>[Instrumental]</i>

<i>Captain Stottlemeyer?</i>

Yeah. Hey.
Uh, is this a bad time?

Oh, no, no. Some friends
are throwing me a little party.
It's sort of a tradition.

Well, congratulations
on your flight.

Oh, hey, and, uh, congratulations
on that crash landing four years ago.

Oh, and, uh, marrying
a figure skater.

Yeah. Congratulations
on your whole damn life.

Uh, this is Lieutenant Disher,

Natalie Teeger
and Adrian Monk.
Hey.

Monk. I know that name.

You're the detective,
the one who quit.

No, l-I didn't quit, uh, exactly.

It was a... It was
a kind of a leave of absence.

It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk.
Some people just can't
handle the pressure.

L-l-l-I didn't quit.
Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry.

My daughter just wrote
a school paper about you.
Good. I need all the P.R. I can get.

She's not gonna believe
that I met you.
Do you mind if I take a picture?

Not at all.
Thank you.

I'm-I'm not a quitter.
I didn't quit.

There were
extenuating circumstances.
There always are.

The trick is not to let them stop us.

Captain, you said it was important.
Oh, yeah. Um...

Do you know a woman
named Joanne Raphelson?

She's dead, isn't she?

She finally did it.

You're not surprised.
[Sighs]

Joanne's been depressed for months.
For years, really.

Was about to have a book published,
but somehow that made it worse.

Like I was saying to Mr. Monk,
some people just can't
handle the pressure.

It was a psychological discharge,
for God's sake.
It's only temporary.

I plan on being reinstated.
He's so much better.

How well did you know her?
Intimately.

When was the last time
you saw her?
Five years ago.

No, wait. Uh, she called you
on the phone last week.
That's true.

She calls me once or twice a year
when she's lonely, depressed or drunk,
and sometimes all three.

Steven? Honey,
we're cutting the cake.

Look, uh, we can talk
about this tomorrow, okay?

That's all right, Captain.
I have no secrets from my wife.

Honey, these gentlemen are detectives.
Joanne Raphelson is dead.

Oh, no. Poor girl.
I made a mistake, Captain.

Five years ago.
Nicole knows all about it.

I don't deserve this woman.

Excuse me, ma'am.
What is that you're drinking?

It's called a Spacewalk.

My husband invented it.

Is-Is-Is that an olive?

And an onion and a cherry.

It's my claim to fame.
Would you like one?

No, thank you. Mr. Wagner,
I was reading about your flight.

They said they almost
had to cancel the liftoff.

You were running late?
That's true.

I got lost on my way to Edwards.
Can you believe it?

You... You got lost?
I tried a different shortcut.

L-l-I guess I'm a better navigator
in the sky than I am on the highways.

Congressman,
glad you could make it.
Steve!

Hey, when are we gonna have
that talk about your future?
The sooner, the better.

Will you excuse us?
Uh, my friends are waiting.

We can talk about this
some other time?
Absolutely.

Great.
It was nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

He's the guy.

Who's the guy?
The astronaut.

He killed her.

Somebody made that exact same drink
atJoanne Raphelson's house
before she died.

Monk, it's not possible.
He was in space.

He did it.
Outer space, Monk.

He was on TV.
He was orbiting the Earth.

You gotta admit
it's a pretty good alibi.

He... He's the guy.

Monk, 99 times out of a hundred,
I am in your corner.

But I just can't see it.
Steve Wagner is a national hero.
It's true, Mr. Monk.

He was on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.
Actually, it was <i>Newsweek.</i>

Actually, it was both. Now, look,
we need to tread carefully here.

First off, there's no motive.
The wife knew about the affair.

A lot of people did.
But it wasn't just the affair.

We just talked toJoanne Raphelson's
editor in New York.

She was about to hand in
her next draft,

which contained a couple
of real bombshells.

Like?
Like, which of her ex-boyfriends
beat her up five years ago.

Somebody put her in the hospital.

She had a concussion, right?
Mm-hmm.

And you think Steve Wagner's involved?

I just don't believe it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

Look, Wagner wants
to run for office.

A story like that would bury him.

Okay. Maybe you found a motive.
Maybe.

But it doesn't matter,
and I'll tell you why.

Because your suspect, Monk,
was in outer space.

He wasn't on this planet.
It's true.

Julie and I watched it
on television.
The whole world was watching.

He took off on Monday,
and he landed on Friday.

Here's the case file.
Now, the coroner
is 100% sure.

He is certain thatJoanne Raphelson
died of ligature strangulation
on Wednesday morning...

while your man was in space.

Now, maybe we should take a minute
and see if we can think
of a better alibi.

It's a pretty good alibi.
Yep.

She had drugs in her system?
Barbiturates.

Yeah. Coroner said
she took some pills.

They didn't work,
she went to Plan "B" and dangled herself.
It happens all the time.

But you said yourself,
the crime scene didn't look kosher.

Yeah, Monk,
what I'm saying is it might be murder,
but it wasn't him.

Captain, I think Monk's right.

Thank you!
Reinforcements.

I think I know how Wagner did it.
Okay, this is the ship.

And let's pretend this globe
represents the Earth.

That's a globe.
It does represent the Earth.

Right. Okay.

Here's what happened.
The first part was easy.
He takes off.

[Mimicking Engines Firing]

As he passes over San Francisco,
he activates the escape pod.

Well, wait. Uh, wait.

Was there an escape pod
on the ship?
No, not officially.

But I think he smuggled one on.
Mm-hmm. And where did he get it...
the escape pod?

He built it.

Yeah, out of a kit.
In his basement.

He's resourceful.
Anyway, splashdown.

Climbs out of the pod,
makes his way to her house,

kills her,
climbs back onto the pod,
fires up the engines, back in space.

Thank you, Randy. That's...
It's just a theory.

I don't think so. No.
I've heard theories before,

and, uh,
they don't sound like that.

<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

It's him.
It's Steve Wagner.

Hello? Yes.

Really? Oh, that's wonderful!

<i>Uh, tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.</i>

Oh, the kids are gonna
be so thrilled.

Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

Steve Wagner is speaking
atJulie's school for Career Day.

Wait. You invited him?
Yeah, I met his P.R. Person
last night as we were leaving.

Natalie, he killed his ex-girlfriend!

Monk, maybe you should go too.

You think the guy's involved?
It'll give you a chance to feel him out.

Fine. Okay.
I'll do it.

You're both coming?

I'm gonna be class mom of the year!

When I was your age,
I was a Boy Scout.

Who here knows the Boy Scout motto?

Be prepared!
That's right.

<i>And that motto saved my life.</i>

<i>Because when the landing gear</i>
<i>didn't come down, I was prepared.</i>

I knew what I had to do.

I went around Florida...
good-bye, Florida...
over Louisiana...

<i>and landed the space shuttle here</i>
<i>in the Gulf of Mexico</i>
<i>with a great big belly flop!</i>

And you weren't even scared?

No, I wasn't scared.
I was terrified!

[Chuckling]
People called me a hero.

<i>But anybody</i>...
<i>anybody could have done that.</i>

You or you or you or you or...

you or you.

Being brave is being afraid of something,
but doing it anyway.

What are you gonna do next?

Tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet
for the air force called the F/ A-22 Raptor.

It's the most advanced fighter
in the world.

<i>She's faster than the speed of sound,</i>

so if you hear a big boom
in the sky tomorrow,
that's me saying, "Hello, kids."

Before I go,

I brought some official Steve Wagner
laser pointers for all you kids.

There you go. Take one,
pass them back.

Well, I had a great time. And remember,
what does Steve Wagner want you to do?

Aim high!
Right there.

<i>Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner.</i>
<i>Wasn't he great?</i>
<i>Let's give him a hand.</i>

Thank you. Okay,
soJulie's next guest
is Mr. Adrian Monk,

who's also my boss,
so everybody be extra nice.

<i>He's going to talk about what it's like</i>
<i>to be a police detective.</i>


Hi.

Hi. I'm... I'm, uh...

I'm...

[Clears Throat]
Leave it.


I'm, uh...

I'm Adrian Monk.

Who wants to be a detective
when they grow up?

What about you?
No.

No?

Everybody in your row
has their hand up, so...

If you put your hand up,
um, it would be a perfect row.

Put your hand up!

Where's your gun?
Um, I, uh...

I don't... I don't have one.
You can't carry one
'cause you had a breakdown.

<i>[Chuckling]</i>
Oh, well, uh...

<i>Julie said you're afraid of milk.</i>
[Chuckling]

Well, everybody's, uh...
everybody's afraid of something, right?

Julie said you're afraid of everything.
Mr. Monk, l... I really...

<i>Have you ever caught a</i> real <i>killer?</i>

Oh, yes. Oh.

Yes, I've caught a lot of killers.

Some killers are very smart,
and some are very powerful.

Some are even famous.
They don't think
they will ever be caught.

But in the end,

they... they are always caught.

And I'll tell you why.

Because the police
can make mistakes.

I make mistakes all the time.

But, uh... But...


See, a-a killer has to be,
uh... has to...


A killer has to be perfect,
and, uh,

nobody's perfect.

The first police officers appeared...

in, an... in ancient Rome in 200 B.C.

They were called centurions.

In many ways,
they were like our modern police force.

It was their job to... to...

To enforce laws...

and to... and to maintain order.

Uh, they were, uh,
chosen for their...

<i>[Chuckling Continues]</i>

For their loyalty and courage!


Here, Mr. Monk.
Drink that.

Are you okay?
Oh.

That was a good, good speech.

I think the kids learned a lot.

Yeah. They're...
They're still laughing.

Well, they'll have to stop soon.
Period's almost over.

Oh, I am such a...
What do you call it?

Wuss. No, Mr. Monk,
you are not a wuss.

Well, I'm not a man.
I know that.

I'm a mutant.
I'm half man, half wuss.

I'm a "muss."
Here you are,
our brave centurion.

I liked your speech,
especially the little dance number
at the end.

Those laser pointers
can be very dangerous.

Yeah, they're a real menace.
I hear you've been checking up on me...

calling Joanne's family,
her publisher,
turning over rocks.

If you want to talk to me,
let's talk right now,
man to "muss."

Did you hit her?
Hit who?

Joanne. Did you hit her so hard
that she woke up in the hospital?

I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk.
That's slander.

Besides, who would believe it?

But that's why you killed her, isn't it?
Because she was about to go public.

She was about to tell the truth
about you.

You're a sad little man.
I can't believe you and I
breathe the same air.

I was on a spaceship, Mr. Monk,
circling the Earth with my crew.

Why doesn't that satisfy you?

Am I making you nervous?

Never. You know why?

[Snaps Fingers]
See?

You flinched.
See, you're a flincher.

You'll never stop me,
because when the chips are down,

when it really counts,
you are always going to flinch.

<i>[Chattering]</i>

Sir, sorry to interrupt.
We have to go.

Would you excuse us?
The governor's waiting.

<i>[Door Closes]</i>

Oh, my God.
You were right.

He killed her.
That was almost a confession.

But how?

How did he do it?

I mean, they were just toys...
little red flashlights...

but I was terrified.

I wanted to scream.

What... What did you do?

I screamed.

Least, I heard screaming.

I'm pretty sure it was me.

Adrian, you were giving a speech
in front of a group of people.

That's real progress.
No, really, I'm very proud of you.

Yeah.

You're never going to be
completely free of fear.

You can't expect that.
But real courage is being afraid
of something and doing it anyway.

No.
What?

Steve Wagner said
the exact same thing.

Really?
The... The astronaut.

Doctor...
Killed his girlfriend.

Wh-Wh-Which I do not condone.
It's indefensible, of course.

See, now I'm afraid all the time.

I'm so tired of being afraid.

Adrian, I'm anxious to talk
about your phobias.

We talked about aversion therapy.

Okay. Let's... Let's... Let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

Okay, okay, all right.
Here we go.

Which of your fears
would you like to work on first?

Glaciers.
Glaciers.

No. Rodeos.

Ah, glaciers.
Glaciers.

W-W-Wait.
Why don't we just start
with a basic one... fear of heights?

Ah, okay. Heights.
Heights.

Let's do it.
Okay, good.
Let's get up on the roof right now.

Okay, wait, wait.
All right. Wait. Sit.
I'll sit.

Sit down.
Okay, I'm down.
I'm sitting down.

I'm not... I'm not ready...
for that.

Uh, let's...

Let's just build up to it gradually.

Here's what...
Why don't we sit here...

and, uh, name really tall things?

I'll go first.

The Sears Tower.

Mmm. Oh,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

Mmm. No. That...
That's too tall.

Uh, not... not the Sears Tower.

Just a regular Sears, maybe.

Just a regular Sears.
Mm-hmm.

Department store.
Adrian, why don't we work on
your phobias another time, okay?

Okay.


When l... When I look at a man...

a real man like Steve Wagner...

I just feel weak.

I just feel so inadequate.

I know he's guilty,
but I'll never be able to prove it.

Adrian, Steve Wagner
is a human being,

and if he's guilty, I know something
he's very much afraid of.

What's that?

You.

She's in the house.

He is up there in space...

circling the Earth.

Maybe he had an accomplice.
No.

We have statements
from all of the neighbors.

There were no visitors, no cars.

She was definitely alone.

Somehow, he killed her
from up there.

Well, she collected a lot of dolls.

Lot of really ugly dolls.

Natalie, holes.

How did we miss that?

They were drilled recently.

<i>So? She wasn't killed out there.</i>
<i>She was killed in here.</i>

She was <i>found</i> in there,

but she could have been killed
someplace else.

<i>[Clanging]</i>

Speak of the devil.
Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.

Are you looking for something?

I wanted a flower
from her garden.

She loved this garden.

I cared for the girl.
I won't deny that.

You came a long way
to pick a flower.
<i>Actually, I was heading up here anyway.</i>

I have a test flight at Paxton
in a couple of hours.

Now it's your turn.
What are you doing here?
I'm investigating Joanne's murder.

Her suicide.

It was murder.
I think we both know that.

<i>Come on, man!</i>
<i>Are you deaf? Please,</i>
<i>just close the damn garage door!</i>

Well, I did, three times!

Right! Well, guess what?
It's open again!

<i>Well, maybe it's broke!</i>
<i>It ain't broke!</i>

It's brand-new!
Holy son of a... Look at this!

<i>Look at him!</i>
<i>He looks just like</i>...

Hey, you know what?
I think that is.
Who?

The... Who? The...
He's the... the guy,
the... the spaceman from TV.

He's famous!
Go get the camera, would ya?
Stay with your brother!

Go get the camera!
Uh, excuse me.

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Uh, you're...
You're famous, right?

You're that, uh, Steve Walenski?
Wagner. Steven Wagner.

Wagner! That's...
I knew that.

Wagner!
You're the space cowboy, right?

Oh, man!
You're that dude that landed
the space shuttle when it was on fire!

That's correct.
I lost 10 bucks on that.

Sorry to disappoint you.
Would you excuse us?

We're in the middle of something.
Could you excuse us, please?

You folks live across the street?
Is that right?

How... Yeah, that's us.
Right over here.

That's right. How are you, man?
Hey, good to meet you.

I'm... I'm Darrell.
This is my daughter Donna here,

and, well, this is Benny.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

What the hell are you doing here?
Would you...

You're curious, aren't you?
That's the best thing a boy can have...
curiosity.

I was friends with the lady
that lived here.

Oh, man.
That's a shame.

That's... That's heartbreaking.

Could we get a picture?
I can do better than that.

I'm flight-testing a brand-new jet
in a couple of hours.
How'd you like to come and watch?

Bring the whole family.
Be my guests.
Are you... you kidding me?

They wouldn't mind?
You have every right to be there.

You're a taxpayer, right?
Yeah. Sales tax.

Could we come too?
I'm a big aviation buff... fan.

<i>[Natalie] So true.</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Fan</i>... <i>Fan or bu</i>ff.

Such a fanatic. Just...
I love airplanes.

Crazy about the, uh...
Can't get enough of'em.

The... The takeoff.
<i>[Monk] And the wings and all.</i>

<i>[Natalie] And the landing.</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>What do you call it? The rudder.</i>

You wouldn't mind if we come,
do you?

<i>[Aircraft Passes Overhead]</i>

<i>[Wagner]</i>
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>state-of-the-art technology here.</i>

The most advanced warplanes
ever built.

Some of these planes are prototypes.
That means nobody's ever flown 'em.

<i>[Darrell] It sounds dangerous.</i>
<i>[Wagner]</i>
<i>It can be dangerous.</i>

Then why do you do it?
If I didn't do it, Benny,
somebody else would.

And where's the fun in that?

Now, you kids will love this.
This is a flight simulator.

It's kind of like
a 30-million-dollar video game.
Cool!

Want to check it out?
Okay.

You grown-ups stay here.
We'll be right back.

Captain Savo, you're in charge.

He is good people.
Yeah, he's good people.

Hey, how well you know him?

Well enough to wonder
what he's doing.
Let's go in.

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's a little dark in there.
No, just...

Let's just wait out here
for a while.

<i>Paulie, why is this garage door open?</i>

Don't know, Sarge.
Opened by itself.
Maybe we installed it wrong.

I got the same problem
with my garage.

It's like an epidemic.

Natalie, I know how he did it.

I know how he killed her!
It's all about the garage doors!

It is?
Yes!

Dad!
Daddy!

Where's Mr. Wagner?
He left. He said
he was late for something.

What's wrong, sweetie?

The astronaut took her doll.
He took her doll?

That's it! Natalie,
it's all about the doll!

You said it was all about
the garage door!
It's about the doll and the garage doors!

It's about both!

Mr. Cain, where did you
get that doll?

L...
Come on.
You stole it, didn't you?

It was in a box
sitting on Joanne's front porch,

and you took it, just like you took
the Fruit of the Month box.

It was sitting there
for three days, all right?

I figured she wasn't home.
You're a horrible neighbor!

<i>Daddy!</i>
<i>[Sobbing Continues]</i>

Honey, it's gonna be all right.

<i>I wanna go home, Daddy.</i>
It's gonna be okay.

It's gonna be all right.
Sweetie, come on.

<i>Huh?</i>

This is Captain Savo.
I just lost two of my civilians.
Notify the law enforcement desk.

Okay, thank you.
Captain's on his way.

We have to find Wagner
before he gets rid of that doll.

Monk, I don't understand.

Here's what happened.
Before he left,

<i>Wagner must have</i>
<i>gone toJoanne's house.</i>

<i>He drugged her,</i>
<i>but not enough to kill her.</i>

<i>Just enough to knock her out</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

Then he built a machine...
a murder machine...

<i>a machine that would hang her on Wednesday,</i>
<i>long after he was gone.</i>

What kind of machine?
A garage door opener.

<i>He left her there drugged,</i>
<i>probably tied up,</i>

<i>and then took o</i>ff <i>into space</i>
<i>with the whole world watching.</i>

Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

I don't know.

<i>They're at Ramp Two.</i>
<i>He's handling the missile.</i>

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Those are missiles!

Th-Th-They could be nuclear weapons!

Then stop me,
for the love of God.

It's all right.
<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>

I don't understand.
She died on Wednesday.
How did he activate the machine?

It was so simple,
it was brilliant.
He used a remote control.

<i>He taped it or glued it down</i>
<i>so it stayed on.</i>

<i>Then he put the remote control</i>
<i>inside one of those dolls.</i>

<i>Then he mailed it to her own house</i>
<i>second-day mail.</i>

<i>Second-day mail.</i>
<i>Wednesday morning!</i>

Exactly.
It was like a time bomb.

<i>The mailman delivered the remote control,</i>
<i>put it on the front porch.</i>
<i>[Beeps]</i>

<i>On the other side of that door,</i>
<i>she was being strangled.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>But they found her in the living room.</i>

After he landed,
Wagner went back to her house.

He dismantled the machine
and moved her body
into the other room.

It was a perfect plan,
except for one thing.

<i>The doll was missing!</i>

<i>He must have panicked.</i>
<i>He went back there again</i>
<i>today to f</i>i<i>nd it.</i>

<i>He knows that remote</i>
<i>can tie him to the murder.</i>

His fingerprints are all over it.
Excuse me. Hi.

Hey, nice ride.
Hi. Listen, we're looking
for Steve Wagner.

He may be on the flight line.
I think they just cleared him
for takeoff.

Great. We'd love to watch.
Which way?

You can't miss him.
He's in a brand-new F/ A-22.

Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hello again.

Could you settle a bet?
My friend and I were wondering if, uh,

somebody could drop anything
out of the cockpit of an F/ A-22?

Of course, uh, I say no way.
Of course you can!

Like what?
Uh, you know, a Japanese doll.

About this big.
Well, there's an air lock,
like a chute,

to drop flares
and emergency transmitters.

I owe you one. Go figure.
Thank you!

<i>[Monk] That's unbelievable.</i>
<i>You win that one.</i>
Wait a second.

Hey, where's your escort?
Just go. Just go, go, go!

<i>Where you goin'?</i>

<i>[Jet Engine Rewing]</i>

No, no, no!
Mr. Monk, wait!

Wait up! Wagner!

Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey!

<i>Pull over! Pull over!</i>

Put your hands on your head
and get on your knees.
[Rifles Cocking]

<i>Sir, step away from thejet.</i>

<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>
<i>Please step away from thejet.</i>

San Francisco Police Department!
That's my man out there!
[Shouting]

Safe your weapons!
Stand down! I say again!
Safe your weapons! Stand down!

[Engine Whirring Down]

Captain...

The doll, sir.
Give me the doll.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Security team,</i>
<i>secure the suspect.</i>

<i>Cu</i>ff <i>the suspect</i>
<i>and secure the aircraft.</i>

<i>Control, suspect's secure.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Julie, come on.</i>

Mr. Monk,
Julie made something for you.

What?
Well, all my friends at school
were talking about what you did...

and how we were so wrong
about Mr. Wagner...

and how you caught him.

Well, um, anyways,
I made you this in art class.

Oh, Julie.
It's a Medal of Valor,

'cause you're the bravest man
I've ever known,
except for my father.

Oh, sweetie.
I'm gonna get the camera.

Well, l... Julie, thank you.
L-I mean, thank you.

What is that? A pin?
Yeah, it's okay.
I'll be careful.

Yeah, don't... Wait, wait, wait.
You know, that...
that can puncture the skin.

People get infected.
I'll just hold it.

How about that?
That's just as good.
Okay.

Okay. Smile.
You too, Rambo.

Hey, wait. Look.
It says "courage."
Yeah, I see that.

I see that.
Take... take the picture.

Okay. "Cheese!"
No flash. No flash.
Retinal scarring.
