Man:
If there's anything else
you can remember,

Or anything you want
to talk to us about...

I think
that's about it, sir.

I got statements
from all the other kids.

Sir.

What's the story
with Harper and Wheeler?

They went to talk
to the suspect's parents.
They had a warrant.

I already know that.
Why haven't we heard back?

I'm trying to tell you.
They called 15 minutes ago.

What do the parents say?
The parents are dead.

Multiple gunshot wounds.

They were still in bed.

Homicide's on the scene.

The final count
at the school

Was six decedents...

Two wounded in the hospital,
one critical.

Same weapon used
in both locations.

Shooter's dead.
The parents are dead.

We got nothing.
Yes, sir.

What about the girl?

That's the other thing
I wanted to talk about.

She still hasn't said
a word.

Her name is
Alicia Browning.

She was standing directly next
to the perpetrator

When tac officer Parker
took his shot.

It was messy.

Yeah, I saw.

We brought her straight here,
but like I said, she's hardly
spoken a word.

I thought you might have
better luck.

When I was in high school
there was this kid,

Paul Ashley was his name.
I hated him.

I really despised the guy.

So one day I decided I was going
to do something about it.

We ended up throwing punches

In back of the field-house
after school.

I gave him a black eye,
he broke my nose.

You can hardly tell.

I remember that when
my parents found out,
they went ballistic.

I was grounded
for a month.

I ended up losing
a girlfriend over it.

What happened
to Paul Ashley?

We became best friends.

This boy today was packing
a tech-9 semi-automatic

With hollow-point rounds
and two clips to spare.

"Perpetrators,"
"decedents."

High school's no place
for kids anymore.

Can I bum a smoke?

Wait a minute...
How old are you?

Gimme a cigarette
and I'll tell you.

Alicia, my name
is Martin van zandt...

I'm chief detective
for the county,

And I've got an awful mess
on my hands.

I really need you
to help me here.

I want you
to understand that you
are not under arrest,

And there are
no charges pending.

I looked you up,
and I guess

You probably know
that you've got a file.

There's an outstanding
shoplifting complaint
against you,

But we're going to
overlook that for now.

Having said that,
we've taken a number
of statements today

Which have caused us
to leave you here for
the duration.

Statements that seem
to confirm

That you and the suspect
in question

Were acquainted.
Is that correct?

Look, did he tell you?

Did you know this was gonna
happen today?

Hey, let's slow
it down, okay?

But, I need you
to know that

If you were aware
in advance and didn't
say anything,

You could get in a lot
of trouble.

Not shoplifting trouble.

Real damn trouble.

Look, as much
as anything else,
we want to know why.

You knew this kid.

You might be able
to help us make some sense
out of this whole thing.

Point of fact,
this young man's grades
were very good.

That's always the weirdest part
about these things.

Common sense
would have you think
that the troubled kid

Would pull stuff like this,
the kid with the temper.

But it never happens like that,
does it?

It's never the bully.
Alicia: Of course not.

Bullies have to graduate,

So they can become
police officers.

How about it,
detective Martin van zandt...

Did you ever pick a fight
in high school?

I would bet almost anything
that you did.

Alicia, did you know
it was going to happen?

No.

If I find out different...

If i...

Please don't let me
find out different.

Can I go now?

Sure.

Man:
Why the hell
did you do that?

She's got something to tell us.
She just wants to do it
on her own.

Bullshit!
What the hell was that?!

I want to know more about her.
Pull her school records.

You know the drill.
Yes, sir.

I just don't understand...
The attitude of these kids.

They think they can
tell us anything,

Like we don't get it.
We're not as stupid as
she thinks we are.

Right.

By the way, how much
did that lighter cost you?

Reporter:
Good evening.

Another high school shooting.

This time in our own backyard.

Police have now confirmed that
there were six fatalities...

God, I was so scared.
I didn't know for so long.

I must have called
the school a hundred times.

I'm okay, dad.

That was your classroom,
wasn't it?

Did you know
any of the kids?

I knew all of them.

What can I do?
Do you want to talk?

I didn't know
if you wanted dinner.

I'm going to bed.

Do me a favor,
please...

Leave your door open
tonight,

so if you need
anything I can...
( Door slams )

Martin:
No, I can't tell you
anything else.

You know the news.

Is he asleep?

How much did he see?

Man:
There are lots of questions.

Our people are working hard
to make an arrest,

So that we can get
some answers.

Our hearts go out
to all the families.

Honey, listen,
I'll have to call you back.

I know.

Captain?
Where the hell is everybody?

We've got a team over
at the high school,

Another team
at the kid's house.

I sent everybody else home.
Sent them home?

Sir, respectfully,
you shouldn't have gone on TV

And said that
there would be an arrest.

And why would that be?

Because this case
is practically closed already.

No, this case is
very much open.

Sir, I don't know
what else you want me to do.

Do you want me to remind you
of your goddamned
job description?!

You will respond.
You will investigate...

And you will apprehend!

That gun had to come
from somebody!

The gun was registered
to the father,

And I can't arrest him.

Well...

Then somebody else knew.

Somebody who could've
prevented all of this.

Somebody who decided

That the lives of two parents
and five classmates

Weren't worth the time
and effort it took

To pick up the phone
and dial 911.

And you will find
that person, detective,

Because that is your job!

Look, Martin,

All of those families
depend on us,

On you and on me.

Martin,

How long is it going
to be before your kid
is in that school?

You will find somebody

To be held accountable
for this atrocity,

And once you have them,
I'll bury them alive
if I have to.

Why don't you just burn them
at the stake?

Are we in agreement here,
detective?

Yes, sir.

( Engine starting )

Sir, the police want
to take more pictures.

Man: Finally.

Kelly...

Who is that?

Kelly:
That's Alicia Browning.

Alicia,
what are you doing here?

I have tests coming up.
I have to go to the library.

Alicia, dear,
there isn't any school.

Not now.

You must understand.

There won't be any classes
for a while.

Well, can't I just...

Okay, what I mean is,
it's still a school, right?

Of course.
You should have been called.

We put it on the news.
I don't watch television.

I'm sorry.
You should have been called.

I have tests coming up.
I'm already a year behind.

I have to get out
of this school.

Of course, but there
aren't any classes right now.

We're coordinating
with Wilson high school.

We want to try and use...
what the fuck am I supposed
to do all day?!

Thanks for climbing down,
by the way.

He's got
a really bad back.

( Church bells ringing )

What the hell is this?
This is where they told us
to bring you.

Did that detective,
van zandt, tell you to do this?

No, ma'am.
This was requested
by your principal.

Doug.

Doug, look who's here.

Alicia,

I'm glad
you could come.

Police car...
Very subtle.

Would you have come
otherwise?

Look, I'm really not
into this group therapy,

Touchy-feely bullshit.

And that's fine.

But maybe you
could use the help.

There are lots
of people here...
for God's sakes.

Miss, can we talk
to you, please?

No...
No, no, no.

There are other students...
Go talk to them.

We tried.
None of them want
to talk either.

We just want to know
how our son died.

Why would you want
to know that?

You're lucky you don't know.
You should keep it that way.

I know it's hard
to understand.
You're young.

You don't know
what it's like
to lose a child,

To have him taken away
and there is nothing
you can do.

Thank you.
This has been very helpful.

Please.

Alicia?

What now?!

In other places
where this sort of thing
has happened,

Group meetings seemed
like the right idea.

I don't know.

But listen, we still have
a student in the hospital...

Deanna Cartwright,
maybe you know her?

Her parents
are very concerned

Because she can't leave
the hospital.

There's nobody there for her.
What is wrong with you?!

I'm a leper!
Don't you know that?!

Exactly what is it
when you look at me
that makes you think,

"There's a good-hearted
young lady who wants to help"?

None of the other students
want to go either.

In truth,
you're the last person
I would have asked.

Come on.

You said it yourself,
you have nothing else
better to do.

They just spent
the last year renovating
the hospital.

Oh, by the way,
it's got a brand new
library, all its own.

Please, can you go see her?

Just once.

Can your father drive you
in the morning?

No, he can't.

Candrive you
in the morning?

( Sighs )

Will you stop sending
police cars to my house?

Yes.

Don't be late.

Thank you.

This is her room number.

She has therapy
in the mornings.

She should be back
by now.

Will you be needing
a ride?

Woman:
All right,
I'll put you through.

Excuse me,
may I help you?

Yeah...

I'm here to see
deanna Cartwright.

She's in...
I beg your pardon?

She's in room 201.

Are you a friend,
or are you family?
I'm neither.

You must be
Alicia Browning.

Come over here
and sign in please.

Hey.

Hi!

No, come in!
This is the right room.

It's Alicia, right?

They said somebody
might come to visit me today,
but they always say that.

And usually
if someone does come to visit,
it's not somebody like you,

It's what they call
a specialist,

Which is just another
kind of doctor,

Which really isn't
very special to me anymore.

Where did all this shit
come from?

You know,
mom, dad, my friends.

This is the first time you
and I have ever really talked.

You got a haircut.

So did you.

Yeah.

I guess it was
a ricochet, maybe.

The doctor said it hit me
in the back here,

But it didn't Pierce
the skull.

The bullet kept coming
around the side of my head,

Underneath the skin,
but it still gouged out
so much bone that...

I didn't ask.

"Those look like
comfortable shoes."

"Would you like
a choc-olate?"

No, wait!
I was just kidding!

I was just kidding!
It was just...

Forrest Gump.

Shit.

I figured you'd do this.

But I honestly thought
it would be longer than
four minutes.

Look, I did
what you wanted.
I saw her.

We exchanged
pleasantries.

We talked about
the old times.

So, can I go now?
No, you may not go now.

You're going to turn around
and get back up there.

And I'll tell you
something else.

You may consider the rest
of the day mandatory.

No. That's bullshit.

You said nothing
about that yesterday.

What I said yesterday doesn't
mean dick today.

See ya.

How bad do you want
to graduate, Alicia?

I said, how bad
do you want to graduate?

I don't have time
for this petty clique
nonsense that kids

Always seem to think
is so goddamn important.

So, you're going to get
your ass back up there

And do as you're told,

Because I know you don't want
to be two years behind, do you?

Do you?!

I am not staying
one second past 5:00.

Thank you.

Will you be needing
a ride home?

I really didn't mean anything
by that Forrest Gump thing.

I was just...
i don't even like
chocolate either.

Shh-hh.

Okay.

You already read
the sports page.

Shh.

Okay.

What are you smiling at?

Nothing.

It's just really nice
to have company.

Really nice.

I'm gonna go ahead
and watch a little TV
while you're reading.

Do you like animal planet?

By the way,
you'll read twice as fast
if you don't move your lips.

TV announcer:
Animal planet puts
the "wild" back in wildlife

With the "Jeff corwin
experience."

Corwin: You have
to hold your ground.
( Elephant trumpets )

For herpetologists,
I am in seventh heaven.

Oh my God,
what're you doing?!

TV announcer:
Every Sunday night at 9:00,
only on animal plan...

( television shuts off )

I'd like to talk
to you about something...

Look, I'm not here
because I want to be,

I'm in here because
they're making me.

So let's get one thing
straight, okay?

When that clock hits 5:00,
I'm gone... you got it?

This isn't one of your fucking
slumber parties

Where we paint each others
fingernails

And we have
pillow fights.

I'm not gonna Pierce
your ears,

And I'm sure as shit not gonna
sign your goddamn yearbook.

Look...

Why don't you just
do both of us a favor

And keep quiet.

Okay?

Okay.

Kelly, hold my calls
for the next 30 minutes.

Sir, the police...
Especially if it's the police.

John, no...

Gentlemen.
The phone's very impersonal.

You know,
I'm just trying
to figure out

What the hell it is
you guys could still
possibly need from us.

You already have
everything we have.

And the department thanks you
for your continued support
of this investigation.

There's only so much
you can learn about a person
by reading their file,

I just wanted to ask you
a few questions about

A student named
Alicia Browning.

Little miss sunshine.
Why?

It's just part
of the investigation.

There's almost a year
and a half gap in her
academic record.

No one seems to know why.
Have you spoken with
her father?

We will.

As for Alicia,
I couldn't tell you
why she was out

Of school for as long
as she was.

You must understand,

We have a student body
of almost 2,000 kids.

It is impossible for me
to know each and every one.

Okay, fine...
maybe you can tell me
who some of her friends are.

Maybe they can help.
She doesn't have any friends.

I'll get Kelly to throw
together a list of the kids
that she had classes with.

But she doesn't have
any friends.

I can also get you a list
of teachers who...

I'm sorry.
You were saying?

Well, it's not that
she's a loner.

The school has plenty
of loners,

But they all hang out
together.

Alicia is more like a...
Principal: Goth.

I think that's what
they call it.

She not really goth either.

She's more like a goth...

Metal-head, ramp-tramp,
bookworm.

Something for everybody
to hate.

How do you
know about her?

I went to school here.

I've only been out
for a few years,

So sometimes the students
tell me things they won't
tell anybody else.

Martin, take a look at this.
Hang on.

The rest is
just common sense.

Anyone she
would've hung out with
has already graduated.

What the hell happened
to this girl?

Alicia:
"Mr. and Mrs. Colby"?

Deanna:
Marcus Colby's parents.

He was in the room
across the hall.

The night he died,
my door was closed,

But I could still hear
his parents.

That was...

That was hard.

Where are your parents?

They used to be here
all the time.

But now that I'm okay,
they can't spend the whole day
with me.

They're usually in here
in the mornings or after work.

Can I talk to you?

Who sent these?
Huh?

These flowers...
there's no card.
Who sent them?

Bobby launer.

He's an idiot.

Look at this.
Three gladiolus,
five carnations,

And a bunch
of white roses?

I think they're pretty.
It's funeral standard.

Your boy's got
a green thumb up his ass.

Either that, or he's got
a great sense of humor.

Do you know why the carnation
became the funeral flower?

Because they smell
super sweet.

They're overpowering,
right?

So back in the old days,
before they'd figured out

How to preserve dead bodies,
they just had to use

Lots of carnations at funerals
to hide the rotting smell.

That...

Really doesn't help me...

At all.

Neither do those.

I didn't get to go
to any of the funerals.

They won't let me leave
even though there's nothing
wrong with me anymore.

Actually,
he's very smart.

Who is?
Bobby launer.

We're in academic decathlon
together.

It's like a club,
and we have competitions
with other high schools.

I know what ac-dec is.

I think sometimes people hate me
just 'cause I get good grades.

Sometimes I have to act dumb
just so people will talk to me.

But all of my real friends
are in the upper first
percentile.

The "upper first percentile"?

Yeah.

Do you get good grades?
I'm barely passing.

So I guess we could
never be friends.

Is Bobby your boyfriend?

Well, you better strike now
while the iron's hot.

I mean, you're very,
very pathetic right now.

There isn't a guy in the world
who'd say no to you.

Try to make the most out
of this little near-death
experience,

Which, by the looks of it,
you're handling just
fine anyways.

I guess.

You know,
"when life gives you lemons..."

What did you just say?

"When life gives you lemons...

Make lemonade."

That is the biggest
load of crap I've ever heard.

What?
"Time heals all wounds."

"Everything happens
for a reason."

And "I guess they're all
in a better place now," too?

So why do they still
have you here?

Are you cracking up
or something?

That's a very rude way
to put it.

Well, I can't help it.

I'm fascinated by nuttiness
and its causes.

I had a few nightmares,
which really excited them.

They even have
a clinical term for it...

"Repressed memory anxiety,"
which I think sounds a tad bit
overdramatic.

But now they spend
every morning trying to tap
my subconscious fears.

Fears so scary
I don't even know
I have them.

It's a complete waste.

I usually end up missing
"the crocodile hunter."

Then why the hell
do you go?

Because they make me.

Because they think
they can help.

But they can't,
because they weren't there,

So I couldn't talk to them
about it even if I really
wanted to.

You know what else?
The shrink can't keep up
with me.

I'm way smarter
than she is.
Are you?

I looked up
her credentials.

They have a great
new library here.

But anyway,
I have a much higher
I.Q. Than she does.

Your I.Q. Doesn't mean
a goddamn thing in the world.

Time served.

Okay, well,
it was nice to finally talk
to somebody who...

Save it.
Can I have these?

Yeah, sure.

( Stuttering )

You can finish this.

There's a crossword puzzle.
Thanks.

Sometimes it's really...
Late.

But I wanted to tell you...

You're welcome.
Alicia!

What?!

What?

I'm dying inside.

It's a good library?

See you tomorrow then.

Do you want any dinner?

We had some visitors today.
Two fellas from the local
police department.

Detectives Martin van zandt
and Michael macready.

They said they've spoken
to you before.

What did they want?

I was hoping
it was just another
shoplifting thing

Or a curfew violation.

But they just really wanted
to know more about you.

This boy, the one
who killed all those kids...

Did you know him?
I knew everybody.

I already told you that.

Of course you did.

They also wanted
to know why you were out
of school for so long.

What did you tell them?

Dad, what did you say
to them?!

I told them
that you're almost
20 years old,

Legally an adult.

If they want an answer
to that question,

They'll have
to ask you directly.

What did they say to that?

They said they could
subpoena me,

And that they could arrest me
for obstruction of justice.

Can they?
Probably.

But I suggested to them
that arresting me

Probably wasn't
in their best interests

From the standpoint
of public relations anyway.

Is there anything
you want to tell me?

You've gone through more
than anyone your age
ever should.

Please talk to me.

I'm going to bed.

Good night.

( Pops )
( Screams )

You think
that's funny?!

Shit!

How long
have you been here?

You're drooling.

What time is it?

How can you stay
in the sack this long?

The sun rises, like,
straight into this room
every morning.

I'm going to the library.

Man: Good morning, dear.
Deanna: Hello.

Good morning.
Good morning, deanna.

Good morning, deanna.
Hi.

Hi, deanna.
Hi, how are you?

Hey, there you are!

What kind of drugs
do they have you on here?

Why?

How can you already be
this peppy?

I love the morning.
It's my favorite part
of the day.

People who think that morning
is the best part of the day,

Are the same kinds
of people that think crust
is the best part of the pizza.

Do you know
everybody here?

I'm kind of
a high-profile patient.

Lucky you.
You can get back to school
and you'll be twice as popular.

Not for long...
i get to graduate with
your class. I'm a year ahead.

It's not my class.
It isn't?

They already graduated.

Wow.

I'm a year ahead,
you're a year behind...

We have
so much in common.

No.

Actually,
that means we have

Even less in common
than we normally would.

God, what is wrong
with you?

Nothing.

I like to assume
the best about people.
Is there anything wrong...

if you keep picking at that,
it's never going to heal.
I wasn't picking at it.

I'm rubbing it
to stimulate hair growth.

I'm too young
for Rogaine.

Why did you miss a year?

You said this library
was good.

All they have
are medical books

and jama magazine.
"Journal of the American
medical association."

Whatever.
I need English books.

English?
If I don't pass,
I don't graduate.

You're failing
your native language?

Fuck you.

You like that word
a lot.

What word?

F-f...

F-fuck?

You really can't say it,
can you?

Of course
I can say it,

But it's a bad word.

It's like taking
the lord's name in vain,

Which you
also did yesterday.

What, you think that makes me
a bad person or something?

I see.

Where are you going?

Deanna?
Where have you been?

Your session
with doctor hollander
started 15 minutes ago.

Yeah...

Well, let's go then.

Deanna, let's go.

Maybe she doesn't
want to.

Excuse me?

Maybe she thinks
the whole thing is crap.

Maybe she doesn't like
dumping her guts out
to total strangers.

And while I'll give her
locking herself in a room

And taking drugs with
a couple of older women

Probably has a certain
kinky appeal for her,

I'm guessing she just
wants you to piss off.

Miss, that sort of language
is not accept...

Shh...
This is a library.

We were just going
to smoke.

We were?
Smoking is not allowed.

This is a hospital.

Are you coming?

Alicia:
Let's go, head case.

Tell doctor hollander
I'm sorry.

Alicia, wait!

Martin:
I appreciate you both
taking time

Out of
your busy schedules.

I'm sorry it's taken
this long for me to speak
with you personally.

I'm sure you've been
quite busy.

How long is this
going to take?

Basically, I just need
some general information
about yourselves.

About us?
Your daughter.

Anything you think
could be helpful...

Personal things,
her friends,

Her relationship
to the shooter.

She didn't know him.

And I don't think deanna
has a personal life.

( Cell phone rings )
Yeah?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna have to call
you back.

All right, bye.

You're not from here.
No, we're from back east.

Dan works for hyperion
and I'm with the f.D.I.C.

So you both work
in the city.

That's a hell
of a commute.

( Cell phone ringing )
Would you please turn
that thing off?

What I mean is,
there are other areas
you could have moved to.

What was it about
our little town that
made you...

We moved here because
of the schools.

It was my decision.

Look, are you guys going
to charge anyone?

Because it's been more
than two weeks and we...

The other parents,
we haven't heard a thing.

I mean, aren't you
doing anything?

The investigation
is ongoing.

Before this attack,
did you notice anything

Out of the ordinary
with deanna?

Erratic behavior?
No, I told you that before.

What is it
that we're supposed
to have noticed?

Nothing.

You're just her parents.

I'll be in touch.

Deanna.
Hi!

What is the point?

If you want to kill yourself,
there's faster ways to do it.

You know that nurse?
She has it in for me.

She's always
bossing me around,

Telling me where to go,
when to go there.

So one day
I say to her,

"Why do you always
treat me like a baby?"

And she says... get this...
"force of habit, honey,

This used to be
the maternity ward."

And I'm like,
"that is weapons-grade b.S.

Give it a rest, sasquatch."

No.

You didn't say that
to her.

No, I didn't.

But it would have been
so cool if I had.

I like your gloves.

It's like Madonna.

Not, you know,
henna tattoo,

English-accent
Madonna.

More like
material girl,
boy-toy Madonna.

Can I try one on?
Go to hell.

Do boys like you
because you smoke?

My mother says
that boys like girls
who smoke because...

Girls who smoke are easy?

Something along
those lines.

Well, boys don't like me
because I smoke.

Boys don't like me,
period.

Men are
a different story.

What's the oldest guy
you've ever dated?

37.

Deanna: 37?!

I don't know.
I always tried to date
someone twice my age.

Because there's something
to be said for experience.

Of course,
that means every year

The men get creepier
and creepier.

What is that?
That's an exponential
problem, I guess.

I don't know.
I'm failing math, too.

Want a drag?
No.

Yes, you do.

No, it's a filthy habit.
It's disgusting.

It makes your clothes stink.
And it's really expensive.

Oh, like money
is some big object for you.

I've seen you at school.

I've seen your car.

Hey, deanna.

Don't get me wrong...
I don't resent you.

I'm sure you value
all the advantages

Wealth gives people
like you over people
like me.

Even though you waste
your time tooling around
with your friends.

Britney Spears pumping,
wind in your hair,

All the neighbors waving.

You really must be the life
of the subdivision.

All that money...

And Bobby launer
still doesn't have

The slightest
interest in you.

And that...
That is what kills you.

You know
what he told me?

He told me he couldn't
take me to the prom

Because I used to date
his best friend.

What was the eloquent way
he put it?

"Bros before hos."

How immature is that?

You believed him?

Yeah, why?

What I mean is,
I'm sure it had nothing
to do with the fact

That his buddy told him
he never had gotten
anywhere with you.

Nope... never let him
eat you out,

Never polished his knob,
never gave him a rim job,

Never let him grope
your tits,

never let him lick your puss...
there's nothing wrong
with being a virgin!

Alicia:
Of course not.

It's hip to be
a virgin nowadays.

It's never hip
to be a virgin.

It's really hard.
I'm sure it is.

Oh, there's a song
about it.

A song?
Yeah.

I think
it's bananarama?

No, no, no...
It's the go-gos!

"Our lips are sealed."

What?!
"Our lips are sealed."

It's about
a bunch of chicks trying
to stay virgins.

Okay, first of all,
that's gross.

Second of all,
you're wrong.

It's about
a bunch of girls trying
to keep a secret.

If I wasn't getting any,

I'd want to keep it
a secret too.

Now, if you really want
to get Bobby launer,

And he sees you
with one of these...

Like mommy says,

"Boys like girls
who smoke...

Because they think
they're easy."

Here.

( Scoffs )
Now that is just

A terrible waste
of tobacco.

What are trying to do?

Are you trying
to save me or something?

Deanna:
You know something?

I don't think you're easy.

I think you're the most
difficult person I've ever met.

( Groans )

Deanna:
No, it's okay.

No, mom,
I understand.

I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

Right,
tomorrow night.

I love you too.

Bye.

You're checking
those books out?

I'm taking them,
if that's what you mean.

Can I have
my remote back?
Why?

No.

Where do you go
at 5:00?

I go to
a homeless shelter

Where I serve food
to the needy and less
fortunate.

I don't know.

I don't go anywhere.

Then why do you leave?

Can I ask you
a question?

Does it matter
if I say no?

How do you stay
so detached from all this?

I was unconscious
halfway into it

And I can hardly sleep.

You must have seen
the whole thing happen.

What's your point?

You seem like
you haven't missed a beat.
Yeah, well, go figure.

( Distorted screaming )

Wait.

Wait, wait, wait!

Wait! It'll pass.
Okay?

Actually, today's been
a pretty good day for me.

I should be able
to get some sleep tonight.

Okay, well...

I'll see you.
Would you do me a favor?

What?

On a good night,
with the right pills,

I can be asleep
before Jay leno's over.

I was wondering,
would you stay till
the end of Jay leno?

I don't watch television.
You could read your books.

They have...
Visiting hours here.

You don't care
about hospital rules.

Right.

But you could get
in trouble.

If you haven't noticed,
I get special treatment
around here.

I'm not reading you
any fucking bedtime stories.

No, no, no.
That's fine.

Leno?

Not letterman,
not nightline, but leno.

Fuck me.

( "Star-spangled banner"
playing )

( Distorted voices
reciting alphabet )

( Gun cocks )

( Gunshot )

( Anthem continues )

( Whispers )
Alicia, are you awake?

( Low frequency humming )

( High frequency humming )

How did I do?
A little better.

Doctor hollander
wanted me to remind you

How important your therapy
sessions are with her.

She doesn't mind
you having guests,

So long as
it doesn't interfere
with your recovery.

She expects you promptly
tomorrow morning.

And I would really
appreciate it, too.

Okay.

Okay.

Have a great day.
Thanks.

( Baby crying )

Alicia?

What are you doing
in here?

Reading.

Here?

If you spent
a little bit more time
in here,

You'd know this
is the quietest place
in the hospital.

Can we go
someplace else?

Good.

Lets get you out
of here before you burst
into flames or something.

What time did you leave
last night?

Late.
Well, thanks.

Hey there.
Hi.

I slept really well.
Good for you.

You know...

There's something about you
that doesn't add up with me.

What's that?

What was someone like you
doing in a public school?

My parents
wanted me to go
to a private school...

Baldwin prep,
St. benedictine.

But, you know,
I got to thinking.

They didn't go
to a private school,
so why should I?

In a public school,
you can really learn more
about real life.

( Scoffs )

So my world
is just some sort

Of social laboratory
for you, huh?

Alicia, you know
that's not what I meant.

What are you doing
with that?!

Don't change the subject.

The Ivy league
is an afterthought

For someone like you
I'm guessing.

Where did daddy go
to school?

Cornell.
Cornell.

It's a great school.
Yeah, you're right, it is.

But if you get in,
you're never really going
to know, are you?

Know what?

Whether you got in
because you deserved it,

Or if they should just put
put a little plaque

Next to your dorm room
that says, "thanks, dad."

I didn't put that
on my license plate,
he did.

He thought
it was cute.

( Telephone ringing )

Van zandt.

No, I'll be home late.

You know why.

I can't.

No, no, I gotta go.

No, I'm sorry.

Mr. Robbins?

The department
gave us permission
to begin renovating,

So don't give me
any of your shit.

No, it's looking good.
It's good.

I need to search
a locker.

Martin:
It's weird being here
without kids.

You probably see it
like this all the time.

I took summer school once.
It was just like this.

I'm becoming
very concerned about

Your interest
in Alicia Browning.

Why would that be?

Is she involved?

You know I can't
comment on that.

I took her to visit
deanna Cartwright

At the hospital
a couple days ago.

Really?

As I understand it,

At some point here,

You're either going
to have make an arrest,

Or you're going to have
to close your investigation.

Either way,
get on with it.

Take as much time
as you need.

It's called
a gerund phrase.

It's g-e-r-u-n-d.

But you only need
to know that for the test.

You'll never use it
in real life.

Hi. Thank you.

Do you want anything?
No.

It's tempting, though...

Dry Turkey breast,
tasteless fruit,

Cholesterol-free eggs...
Mmm, tasty.

How did you know that?
It's hospital food.

My parents are
coming tonight.

I'll be sure
to leave early then.

You don't have to.
No, no, no.

It'll be all huggy-kissy.

Probably.

Gimme one of those.

You throw worse
than a girl.

Wait.

Close one.

Do they bring you
good shit?
My folks?

You wouldn't be
interested. Look.

Okay, this pretty much sums up
how mom and dad see me.

A coloring book.

What?

Did they bring you
crayons with that?

Yeah.

Thanks.

There's only
one black one, though.

I know it's
your favorite color.

Here's a bop magazine.

Do you like
the backstreet boys?

Yeah, me neither.

You're probably
into that Tori amos,
Fiona apple, whiny rock.

But Kevin and Brian
are hot.

Who the hell
are you talking about?

Forget it.

Are those the guys you think
about when you masturbate?

I don't think we should be...
Don't say that you don't.

I'm not saying that I don't,
I'm just saying

That I don't think I should
be discussing that with...

God, you say stuff like that
just to set me off.

Why do you do that?
Because you make it
so easy for me.

It hurts.

What does?

The first time you do it.
It hurts.

It's what every virgin wants
to know, right?

It hurts.
It burns sort of.

I know.

How...

How much?
I don't know.

I think it's different
for everyone.

It probably doesn't hurt
as bad as,

Oh, I don't know, say,
getting shot in the head.

I mean, come on,
it's not like you see a lot

Of chicks laid up
in hospitals

After getting
their cherries popped.

It stings a little.
On the bright side,

If you do it with
a high school boy,

Chances are he won't be
in there very long anyway.

Yeah.

You know, I don't know
if I can do it.

I mean, I want to do it, but...
Don't worry, it'll happen.

You'll meet
the right guy,

Or you'll meet the wrong guy,
and it'll just happen.

Even Forrest Gump got laid
eventually.

I didn't think you saw
"Forrest Gump."

Oh, I saw it.
I just thought you were doing
a shitty impression, that's all.

I'm really glad
you're here, Alicia.

Oh God.

Here's your damn
God-box back.

My God-box!

The Brady bunch... I love
"the Brady bunch." Do you?

I don't know
if I've ever seen it.
It's an old show, right?

The '70s.
It's totally hilarious.

Jesse James.
Jesse James?

Principal:
Jesse James was a cruel
and vicious killer.

I'm really surprised
at Bobby.

Bobby's teacher
might never have brought

This composition
to my attention if it
hadn't been for this.

He knows better
than to bring a cap gun
to school.

We'll certainly have
a talk with him.

I'm sure he doesn't
intent to make a profession
out of being an outlaw.

( Laughing )
Oh my God!

This show is awesome!
It isn't funny.

Oh, come on!

It is!
( Laughter )

( Siren wailing )

Mike Brady:
He knows better than
to bring gun to school.

( Distorted voices )

( Sobbing )

Deanna:
She's very sad...

Lonely.

I don't know why, but...

I know I like it
when she comes to see me.

I shouldn't.
She's mean to me.

But there's
something else,

Something I can't put
my finger on.

To look at her you'd just think
she was a mean-spirited punk,

But I think there's more
to her than that.

Alicia understands me
better than she should.

I don't know why.

Deanna, it's very important
for me to know everything
I can about her...

Even things you don't think
are important.

I know, it's just,
the truth is we don't...

We don't really
talk about it.

Deanna,
don't pick at that.

I wasn't picking at it,
mother.

Honey, this girl,
she was the only one

That saw everything
that happened in that room
from start to finish.

I know, and I've seen her
with him, but only a few times.

It's not like they hung out
all the time or were dating
or something.

That's not true,
'cause the police have
his phone records.

They know he talked to her
for an hour the night
before the shooting.

Where did you hear that?
Who cares?!

That could mean anything.
Why does she keep coming
to see you?

I mean,
what's in it for her?

I guess,
because I'm tutoring her.

You're what?
Tutoring.

She's failing English.

What?
If she wasn't
failing English,

Can you think
of any other reason?

No. I...
What are you saying?!

I'm sorry.

It's just that...

It's hard for us, too.

You've learned something
that as adults

We hope you don't have
to deal with until
you're much older.

What's that?
That there is very real
evil in this world.

And a lot of times,
evil wins.

But there's nothing
you can do.

You're too late.

If Alicia Browning
had foreknowledge
of this attack,

And didn't say anything,

Under the eyes of the law

She's considered an accessory
before the fact.

It means
she's responsible.

It means she's the reason
you're in the hospital
right now.

Do you really believe that?

I need your help.

You're the only person
she talks to.

I'm not wearing a radio for you
or any of that cop-show stuff.

Deanna, you are speaking
to a police officer.

It's nothing like that.

You just talk to her
like you always do.

But the next time,
ask her...

Ask her if she knew.

That's all I need.

Can you do that
for me?

Yes, she can.

Dr. hollander,
excuse me.

Deanna.

Thank you.

I'm sorry we have to meet
in this room today.

We certainly have been
missing each other, haven't we?

How are you?
Hanging in there.

Yeah, I can see that.

Is the Xanax helping you
get sleep?

Very much so.

How are you feeling?

You already asked me that.

You know, in some parts
of the world, violence...

Can I ask you a question?
Of course.

Do you ever administer the test
where you look at an ink blot

And talk about what
the patient sees in them?

Yes, I have.
Would you like to take one?

Do you think they actually
give you meaningful insight?

Yes, I believe they do, yes.
Does it work the other way?

Can what somebody else
has drawn tell you things
about them?

Volumes... people look
at a Rembrandt or a Picasso,

And they write 300-page
dissertations on what

Might have been going
through the artist's mind.

What does that tell you?

It might help to know
when you did this.

Yesterday.
And it wasn't me,
it was... a friend.

A friend. Okay.

Well, ah...

The color is certainly open
for evaluation.

It's almost random.

Very vivid hues.

The person was pressing
very hard on the crayon.

I'd say whoever colored this
was distraught.

I'm sorry,
you were being serious.

The coloring stays firmly
within the predetermined lines.

Almost perfectly.

Someone is trapped.

And this page
was probably chosen
for a reason.

Rabbits and bears playing
in a park.

You don't think these sessions
are worth a damn, do you?

No, ma'am.

And you probably think
you that should have been
released days ago.

Yes, as a matter
of fact. Yes.

I think this whole
"post-concussion syndrome"
is made-up.

I haven't had
a dizzy spell in days,

My hearing
is getting better,

The only real issue
is my hair.

And if I understand
human physiology,

It tends to grow back.

These are afflictions
of the body, not the mind.

There is something
troubling you,

And this is the place
you can talk about it.

You can't help me.

No, I can't.

Not unless you talk
with me.

You can't help me
because there's nothing
you can tell me

That I can't read
in the same books you do.

Have you been
reading books?

What have
you been reading?

Have you been reading
about post-traumatic
stress disorder?

Have you been reading
the stories

About combat veterans
who have seen and experienced

The most horrible things
a person can?

Is it true that there
is no cure?

It absolutely
can be treated.

With the proper balance
of drugs for the effects,
and therapy.

But, no,
there is no cure

In the usual sense
of the word.

And...

Is it true that
most people who have
post-traumatic stress

Have to live
with it for the rest
of their lives?

For some people
that is so.

But not all.

Okay, that's all
I needed to know.

The only way you're going
to feel better, deanna,

Is if you can talk
about this.

I know.

I know.

That was a nice
long session.

How is doctor hair-farmer?

What the fuck?

Alicia, did you...

Ow! Stop!

What the hell was that?!

Dive bomber.
What did I do?!

You should be less
oblivious.

What is it about your cranium
that invites such folly?

Just lucky, I guess.

Maybe it's your I.Q.

"Oblivious."

Sometimes you use
really big words

For somebody who's
failing English.

Go figure.

You know,
I've been thinking,

I haven't really seen you
around school with boys.

Well, I mean,
I've only seen you
with really one boy.

Personally,
I was wondering...

About you...
Your relationship.

How you... how you feel...
How I feel about boys?

No.

How close you were to...

I'm trying to ask you something
that's really hard for me
to ask.

I'll make it easy, okay?

Huh?

What are you doing?!

It sounded like you were
asking me if I was into girls.

Well, I wasn't!
Which probably means
you're into girls.

I'm not!
If you wanted to know,
you could've just asked!

You could've just lied...
It was the only way to be sure.

But you didn't kiss me back,
so you got nothing
to worry about.

I guess.

You are such a weirdo!

The police came
to see me last night...

About you.

Took them long enough.

They said...
It doesn't matter...

But they asked me
a bunch of questions.

And I think they want
to arrest you.

Fuck 'em.
But they're not
going away.

I don't know what
you're not telling them,

but they're not going away.
That's their job.

What're you going to do?
I'll have to check
my schedule.

Alicia, they're police.
Yeah, we go way back.

No, I mean...
I got a lot of friends
downtown...

Stop it,
stop it, stop it!

I'm so sick of this.

I'm so tired of listening to you
talking like nothing happened.

That this is all no big deal?!
I'm so exhausted.

And I still can't sleep.

My head is so messed up
and I just don't care anymore.

I just can't.

You know those flowers
in my room,

All those presents?

They're almost all
from my parents.

Bobby launer didn't
send me flowers...

I just told you that because
I didn't want you to know.

I read this story
when I was little...

About a princess
who didn't have any friends.

And her father, the king,

Couldn't stand to see
his daughter all alone.

So he used his riches

To buy her some friends.

When the princess
found out,

She was so angry
with the king.

She felt humiliated.

If my father used
his money to buy me

Some pretend friends...

I don't think
I would mind at all.

I want you to leave.

I don't want you
to come back here anymore.

You don't have
to ask me twice.

Then leave. Please.

You know, I got
better things to do
with my days

Than hang around
with a head case
like you.

Then do them.

Fuck you!

You little cunt!

Who the fuck
do you think you are?!

You and your,
"woe is me" bullshit!

You haven't even faced
the half of it yet!

You think
you're alone now?!

Because you have
no idea

How bad it's really
going to get!

Alicia, please don't
do this.

I know exactly
what you were trying
to ask me,

And know exactly
what you think of me.

You fucking drama queen!

Go take your goddamn
guilt trip somewhere else

Because I don't want
to fucking hear about it!

Does this look crooked?

Crooked?
Yeah.

It looks crooked to me
if you stand back from it.
It looks dead-on to me.

So, I've logged
our first piece of...

I guess,
would you call it evidence?

Yes, that's what
it's called.

Good. Well, then,
you must be relieved.

It's progress, right?
I don't look relieved?

I got a lot of work here...
Is there anything else?

No.

Actually, yeah.
I'm gonna have to call
the d.A.'S office...

They're gonna want
to know what charges
we're thinking about filing.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?!

I guess I need
a little clarification.
The hell you do.

Perform your duty,
uphold the law.

It's very simple... it needs
no further explanation.

Yes, sir.
You know damn well
what charges we'll be filing,

So put your call into the d.A.
Whenever you feel like it.

If there is something else
that's bothering you,

I don't give a shit.
This is our job,

Like it or not.

Martin, why did you
let her go?

What are you talking about?

That first night,
why did you let her go?

Because I didn't have
enough to hold her on.

Unlike the Mountain
of evidence we have now.

You had just as much cause
to arrest her that night
as you do right now.

If you really feel so strongly
about what you're doing,

Why the hell did you let her go
in the first place?

We have to be the voice
for those families.

Can you understand that?

If we are going to speak
for them...

Maybe we should find out
what they really want us to say.

All right!

What the fuck?!

What the hell
are you doing out here?

Hey, head case,
I'm talking to you.

What are you
doing here?

I was in the neighborhood.
What do you think?

I told you not
to come back.

Which you had to know was
the surest way to get me
to come back.

Okay, what're you doing
with the needle?

What the fuck is up
with the syringe?

The doctors
can't make it stop.

I want to go home,
but they won't listen.

And I don't care
anymore.

So, we're into
the real deal here.

Okay.
I can't really
remember it.

But when I go to sleep,
it always comes back.

And I don't know
if it's real,

Or if it's just
what I think happened.

But I can hear them.

The other kids...

Trying to get out.

And you figure
if you shoot yourself
full of enough poison,

That'll pretty much
put an end to all that?

That's bullshit.
That is an insult
to all of those kids.

You're trying to take
the easy way out.
So did you.

You shouldn't
have said that...

But, yeah, I did.

And look at how wonderful
I turned out.

Now...

Let me tell you
about this, okay?

See, in the movies,
they don't tell you that

When you slash your wrists,
you also cut through tendons.

Now I can barely use
this hand at all.

It took me over a year
to learn how to write
with the other one.

Look, I don't know
what it is you want me
to tell you.

I'm not real good
at this kind of thing.

Tell me it gets better.

I can't.

Because it won't.

I can't make it stop.

It's killing me.

Good.

It hurts because
it's supposed to.

I mean, what would it say
about you if it didn't?

What would it make you
if it didn't tear you up inside?

What would it make you if
you didn't feel anything at all?

You know what that
would make you?!

Me.

And I would give anything

To feel even half
of what you're feeling
right now.

Okay, listen.

What kind of music
do you listen to?

Pop.
No.

What I'm saying is,
whenever I hear a song

That I already know,
I change the channel.

I look for a songs that
I've never heard before.

Do you listen to songs
you know,

or songs you don't know?
Songs I know.

Okay.

I going to show you
something.

Something you don't know.

But first,
I want you to give me that.

( Sighs heavily )

So, you're smart.

What's in this?

Potassium chloride.

You'd kill yourself
before you hit the ground.

Just faster than smoking.

You made a joke.

Yeah, and it took
a lot outta me, so...

Don't expect another one.

Alicia: Come on.

Deanna:
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

it wasn't
a very good joke.
I know.

( Walkie-talkie chatter )

What room is this?
Shh.

Alicia:
Wait right here.

Deanna:
Alicia, it's cold in here.

Oh Jesus!
What?! What's wrong?!

What the hell
is wrong with you?!

No, why won't you look?

( Screaming )

What, are you scared?!

What is there
to be scared of?!
God damn it!

Alicia: Look.

Turn around and look!

You've got it all wrong.

There's nothing here.

Nothing.

You wouldn't have been afraid
of him when he was alive,

Why should you be afraid
of him now?

There is no hatred
in this room.

No anger.

There's no violence.

There's less
to be afraid of in here

Than anywhere else
in the whole world.

Alicia:
So, what do you think?

You look just like him.

Hey, get out of here.

Do whatever it takes,

But get your parents
to get you out of here.

It'll kill you
if you don't.

You're not coming back,
are you?

I'm not going
to see you again, am I?

I'll be around.

Alicia.

Are you real?

I mean, this whole thing,
it really happened.

Good night, deanna.

Bye.

Bye.
Take care.

Thanks.

( Rock music playing )

* that's when
they'll disappear *

* that's when we'll
be feared. *

Wait! Wait, dad,
go back one!

* in the jealous games
people play *

* our lips are sealed

( screams, applauds )
What? Are you okay?!

Yeah. I'm fine.

* our lips are sealed.

If you need them,
they'll be ready.

Captain.
Detective.

What do you need?
Do you remember 1988?

We killed one of our own
undercovers.

I was in charge
of the bust.

Remember that?
Of course I do.

The review board asked me
to resign.

And when I didn't,

They were gonna pin
the whole thing on me.

You went in front of them
and got me off the hook.

Remember what you said
to them?

I've just spent
the better part of the last

Two months looking at this thing
from every angle possible.

And I've spoken
with the families.
All of them.

And now I think that only one
of two things can happen.

Sir, I have macready
and Harper and Wheeler

And half a dozen uniforms ready
to leave here right now.

And I got the order here
from the judge to make it
all nice and neat.

But before I go,
I gotta hear it from you.

One more time...
I want to hear you say

That we're going to lay
nine murders

At the feet
of a teenage girl,

Because of
a telephone bill.

You know,
I don't care too much

About what people say
out there in the world...
we're police officers,

And that means
that at some point,

Right and wrong has
to factor into this.

Doesn't it?

So if you tell me that
this is the right thing to do,

I'll be at her front door
in 10 minutes.

All you have to do
is sign it, sir.

What a mess.

Sir,
with your permission,

This is what
I'd like to do.

Do you know if any
of the others are coming?

I was hoping for
a little better turnout.

My parents don't even
know I'm here.

Deanna:
Is this everyone?

Looks that way.

Listen,
what we're doing here,

A lot of people will say
is a mistake.

That going back in here so soon
is the wrong thing to do.

That it's insensitive.

I think it's very important.

This is the kind
of thing that people want
to put behind them,

They want
to stop talking about it.

And the second you do that

Is the second it happens
all over again.

This is not a requirement.

None of you have to do this
if you don't want to.

Okay then.

It smells kind
of funny.

They painted it.

It smells like paint.
Is it the right color?

Together: No.

It's really close,
though.

There were 16 shots fired
in this classroom.

Most of them came
from the back there.

He ran out as he moved forward
along the side wall.

Boy:
Okay, does that mean
anything?

It means it wasn't a spur
of the moment decision.

He came in
through the back,

Knowing everybody would panic
trying to get out this door.

Boy #2:
Is there a point
you're making?

It's very odd
from the detached viewpoint
of law enforcement.

In a mass shooting,
you usually see twice
as many wounded as killed.

But in this case,
everyone who was shot died.

Girl: Except for deanna.
Martin: Except for deanna.

Of course, why he did it
is still unanswered.

If you wanted to know that,
you shouldn't have killed him.
That's brilliant.

What were they supposed to do,
ask him to politely stop?

Deanna:
No, I think he's right.
They didn't have to kill him.

What, are you both fucked?
Okay, okay! Hey.

Everyone can talk here,
all right?

And just
so you understand,

The tactical officer performed
his job to the letter.

And I bet you gave him
a big fat medal for it.

As a matter of fact,
he resigned.

He doesn't even
live here anymore.

Deanna, how do you feel
about being in here?
I don't like it.

I don't know if they should
ever use this room again.

Boy #3:
But you know they will.

After everybody graduates,
they'll act like it
never happened.

What are your plans
after graduation, James?

You're the class president?
Yes, sir.

I was planning
on going straight
to college, but...

I might just take
some time off.

Deanna?

I just got a scholarship
to Cornell.

That's excellent.
Congratulations.

I don't know
if I'm going or not.

Shit, if I was you,
I'd be like, "see ya."

I'd get as far away
from here as I could.

I'll be stuck
in community college forever.

Girl:
I haven't really thought
about it too much.

I guess I should,
though.

I'd really rather not
even graduate,

If you want to know
the truth.

Doug?

Whatever you cops
will let me do, I'll do.

I don't like to look
too far ahead.

I don't even want to deal
with right now, you know?

This whole thing?
Deanna: You have to.

I mean, it's there,
whether you like it or not.

We graduate
in three days,

So you better be ready
for that black armband.

You know
it won't stop there.

At the five-year reunion,

Be ready for that
moment of silence.

It'll be with us forever.

The sooner you accept that,
the easier it'll be.

I don't know why it had
to happen here.

I mean, it's home room.

We're only in here
for 15 minutes everyday.

Let's talk about that then.

( Sobbing )
Cathy?

You don't have to stay
if this is too hard.

James is right.

It was just such
a normal day.

You know how
some people said that

When they heard
the gunshot that...

It sounded like
firecrackers?

I didn't.

Somehow I knew.

He aimed over here
and I closed my eyes...

And he fired.

And when I opened them,

It was Marcus
that was shot instead.

And I was just so...

Jesus, I was...

What?

Were you glad?

Yes.

You were glad that
he shot Marcus Colby
and not you.

I never got to tell him
I was sorry for thinking that.

There's nothing
to be sorry about.

Self-preservation
is the most powerful
instinct you have, okay?

It gave you the time
you needed

To get out
of the room alive.

I know it's not easy,

But it's nothing to be
ashamed of either.

Now see,
why are we doing this?

This is why
nobody else came.

Once was enough.

What happened
in here was the most...

Alicia:
How would you know?

You were the first person
out the door.

You don't have a clue
what happened in here.

What are you doing here?
I do believe everyone
was invited.

Am I right,
detective Martin van zandt?

Hey, head case.
Hi.

She shouldn't be here.
She's not even one of us.

Martin:
What does that mean?

It means nobody likes her
because she's a damn freak.

If you're what's passing
for normal,

I'll keep the fucking
straitjacket. Thanks.

She looks like the crow.
What is it that makes her
a freak?

That!
That is so warped.

What the fuck? It's my gum.
From about three months ago.

You know,
I think Alicia's okay.

Thank you, Douglas.
That means so much coming
from a skate-rat

Who hangs in the Wal-Mart
parking lot until 3:00 A.M.

It smells funny in here.

Maybe we should get
some carnations.

James:
She's not one of us
because she was supposed

To graduate like,
10 years ago.

Martin: So be it.

But she still has a perspective
on this that might be helpful.

Yeah, she knew
the motherfucker.

So what?
So what if she did?

So I bet he didn't even think
about killing her.

Great! So she wasn't
a marked target.

Maybe if we were all
nicer to each other,

Nobody would ever be
a marked target.

Yeah, "why can't
we all just get along?"

Jesus... happy endings
everywhere.

With you,
even mushroom clouds
have silver linings.

Why do you let her talk
to you like that?

Because she's right.

I am that way.

You stopped smoking.

Yeah, well...

Maybe I started
something worse.

Listen, I don't have
all day,

So let's get to it.

Did it ever dawn on you

That maybe there are
no answers here?

That maybe he came
in here shooting

without a single thought
in his fucked-up head?
It crossed my mind.

I don't think it
lasted longer than
30 seconds.

He shot at whatever
wasn't moving.

People got bunched up
at the door, so...

It made it real easy.

And just so you know,

You didn't get hit
by any ricochet.

He aimed for the back
of your head, point blank.

I thought you were dead
for sure.

The fact that you're
alive right now

Is the weirdest part
of this whole thing.

So if it only took
30 seconds,

And it took us six minutes
to get on scene...

What happened the rest
of the time?

What did happen?

She kept him in here.

You kept him from going
anywhere else in the school.

Because you were the only one
he would listen to.

You stopped him from hurting
anyone else.

Thank you, Alicia.

Yeah.

No, thank you.

I'm a true fucking hero,
is that it?

Yeah, well...

Sometimes I really don't
understand you.

Perfect.
Why do you want everyone
to hate you so much?

You dress so that no one
will come near you,

We have
nothing in common,

We'd never even talked
to each other until you came...

To the hospital.

Wait.

Alicia's voice:
It's tempting, though.

Dry Turkey breast,
tasteless fruit,

Cholesterol-free eggs.
Mmm, tasty.

How did you know that?

If you spent a little bit
more time in here,

You'd know this
is the quietest place
in the hospital.

How can you stay
in the sack this long?

The sun also rises straight
into this room every morning.

Don't.

We had the same
hospital room.

201.

So...?

But you've been back
in school for a while now.

So it must have been
over a year ago.

Before the library,

Before the renovation...

When the recovery ward
used to be the maternity ward.

Shut up.
She told me that.

The nurse made a joke about
how the recovery ward used
to be the maternity ward.

Shut up.

It's okay.

You have a baby,
don't you?

No, you really need
to stop now!

It's all right.

Hollander:
This page was probably
chosen for a reason.

Rabbits and bears playing
in a park.

That's why you missed a year.

Fuck you,
you cocksucker!

You don't know shit
about me!

Who the fuck do you
think you are?!

You think you can come in here
and spend 10 minutes

And come out with
all the fucking answers?!

Hey, I've got one...
Kids pick up guns

And kill other kids!
That's it!

And if that answer
isn't good enough,

Then maybe you should go see
a doctor or a priest,

And you can ask them why.

They'll feed you
all the psychobabble
you can stand.

Or they'll tell you
that God has some greater
plan for everyone.

And when you keep pressing
and those answers aren't
good enough,

All they have left to tell you
is the unholy truth,

That kids just die!

And babies die, too.

It just happens...

So you live with it.

Deanna:
Oh no, Alicia,
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

I shouldn't have...

Oh my God.

Alicia:
You know...

When you don't have...

Any money...

And your baby dies...

The funeral home gives you
this casket...

For free.

I guess, it's about...

This big...

And it's made...

Out of styrofoam.

It's like one of those things
you would take on a picnic.

Did you even know
there was such a thing

As a styrofoam coffin?

How fucked up is that?

When?

Two winters ago.

We had that...

Colossal ice storm.
Do you remember that?

No school for two weeks.

Alicia: Yeah.

She was born...

And she died
on December 21st.

The thing...

The machine at the cemetery
couldn't dig,

'Cause the ground
was too hard.

It was frozen.

We had to wait until
after Christmas to bury her.

Why would you ever go back
to that hospital?

Why did you come back here?

What did you call her?

Your daughter...

What was
your daughter's name?

Amanda.

He called me.

The night before
the shooting,

He called me.

He told me not
to come to school
in the morning.

He told me he was going
to bring a gun,

And that he was going
to kill everyone.

I'm sorry,
I didn't believe him.

I'm sorry
I didn't stop it.

You didn't do anything wrong.
Wait, Alicia.

Alicia,
it wasn't your fault!

Well?!

What are you waiting for?!
Arrest her!

Isn't that what you wanted
to hear?!

Bring her back.

I closed the investigation
three days ago.

It isn't
public knowledge yet.

There will be no arrest.

Then why the hell
did you bring us here?

Because I'm a father,
and my kid will be your age
in less than a heartbeat,

And as soon as he's old enough
to figure this out,

He's going to ask me what
it all means, and I don't know
what to tell him.

You're asking us?!
You're the adult!

You're supposed to have
all the answers!

I can't turn on my TV
without hearing somebody say
why they think it happened...

"too much violence on TV."
"The national rifle
association."

"He was teased too much."
"Harassed by other students."

"Guns without safety locks."
"Guns without safety locks."

"Violent rock lyrics."
"Violent video games."

"Video games."
"Pulp Fiction."

"Pulp Fiction."
"Natural born killers."

"Hatred."
"Cry for help."

"A cry for help."
"Culture of death."

"Culture of death."
"Be on the cover of
'time' magazine."

My head can't even hold
all the answers I hear
every single day!

Cathy:
"'Time' magazine."

Deanna:
So, now you come to us

Because you want
to know why?

You want to know
what it means?

It doesn't mean
a goddamn thing in the world.

* it doesn't mean much

* it doesn't mean
anything at all *

* the life I've left
behind me *

* is a cold room

* I've crossed
the last line *

* from where I can't turn

* where every step I took
in faith *

* betrayed me

* and led me
from my home *

* sweet surrender

* is all that I had
to give *

* you take me in

* no questions asked

* you strip away the ugliness
that surrounds me *

* are you an angel?

* am I already that gone?

* I only hope that I won't
disappoint you *

* when I'm down here
on my knees *

* sweet surrender

* is all that I have
to give *

* sweet surrender

* is all that I have
to give *

* and I don't understand

* how the touch
of your hand *

* I will be
the one to fall *

* I miss the little things

* I miss everything
about you *

* it doesn't mean much

* it doesn't mean
anything at all *

* the life
I've left behind me *

* is a cold room

* sweet surrender

* is all that I have
to give *

* sweet surrender

* is all that I have
to give. *

* the silicon chip
inside her head *

* gets switched
to overload *

* and nobody's gonna go
to school today *

* she's gonna make them
stay at home *

* and daddy doesn't
understand it *

* he always said
she was good as gold *

* and he can see
no reasons *

* 'cause there are
no reasons *

* what reason do you need
to be shown? *

* tell me why
I don't like mondays *

* tell me why
I don't like mondays *

* tell me why
