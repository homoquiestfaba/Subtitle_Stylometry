The tale of the Harimaya Bridge.

Do you know it?

Everybody in Kochi knows that one, honey.

We sing about it during the Yosakoi dance.

# At the Harimaya Bridge,
in Kochi, in Tosa... #

Hello.

Oh, let me take your bag for you.

This one, then.

This way, please.

Look, spare us the song!
This isn't a karaoke bar.

May I take your order?

Yes, he'll have nabeyaki udon.

Zaru-soba.

The hamburger combo.

And I'll have tsukimi udon.

Yes, I understand.
Will that be all for you?

Yes.
Coming right up.

This way!

I'll show him how to use this.

" Like father, like son"
doesn't apply here, huh?

He just landed. He probably
feels awkward right now.

Awkward doesn't equal rude.

Here.

" Education Office"

I'm back.
Thanks.

Daniel-san wants to take
the paintings Mickey-sensei gave to us.

Daniel-san wants to know
where Kubo-sensei is.

Well...

I spoke to her father
not long after she quit.

He said she moved away,
but he didn't say why or where.

He wants us to call her parents,

because they might have
Mickey-sensei's paintings.

Well... it might not
do any good, but I'll try anyway.

Okay, see you later.

Hara-sensei!

Can you take these reports with you, too?

Sure.

Principal, they're here.

Ah, here they are.

" Enjoy your life in heaven!"

Please join me for tea
after you're finished here.

Thank you very much.

You don't say that!
What's wrong with you?! Get going!

Excuse me, Hara-sensei...
My name is Takeuchi.

I'd love it if you could introduce
my student here to Mr. Holder.

Emi.

She was Mickey-sensei's favorite student
in all the schools he taught at.

He said so himself.

And Mickey-sensei was the one
who taught her to paint.

This is Emi.

Don't be shy. Remember what
Mickey-sensei taught you?

Say " hello."

Well, class is about to start.

Please excuse us.

Hara-sensei! Daniel-san!

Go on. Give them to him.

These paintings are very special to her.
She wants Daniel-san to have them.

Daniel-san says "Thank you."

Emi, what did Mickey-sensei teach you
to say when someone says "Thank you "?

I'm sorry! We didn't mean to delay you.

Thank you, Takeuchi-sensei.
And thank you, Emi, for your gift.

I'm back.

Did you talk to Kubo-sensei's family?

I called.
They don't have a single painting.

Her father got very touchy.
He wouldn't tell me any details.

And no singing!
Daniel-san's had a very long day.

You just don't like
people having fun, do you?

I just don't like you having fun.

W- Wait!

Wait! Wait a second!

Daniel-san, please don't do this!

Yuichi, there's a black man here!

Who are you?
I don't want your kind near my house!

You've caused my family enough shame!

Get out of here!

I'm so sorry! This is all my mistake!

Who are you?

I'm Nakayama, from the
Tosa County Education Office.

I'm so sorry!

The education office?!

Please, Daniel-san, let's go!

Your office and the Prefectural
government will hear about this!

I know important people! Just you wait!

Beat it!

Daniel-san, let's go!

Please forgive us for disturbing you.

We're so sorry. Please forgive us.

Please forgive us. We're s-so s-s-sorry...

Do you understand what you've done?!

Do you understand your position as
a representative of the government?!

You completely lack common sense!

What were you thinking, bringing
this person to a private residence?!

You caused a lot of trouble!

And Inoue-san, you bear
a heavy responsibility for this too!

What kind of office are you running here?!
I'm at a loss for words!

I'm so sorry!

Please forgive my lack of leadership!
I deeply apologize!

I'm sorry, please excuse me.

Pardon me.

Emi, could we talk to you for a minute?

Emi, do you remember these paintings?

My gift to Daniel-san.

Yep!

He likes your gift very much!

And he's very interested in this one.

The painting of Kubo-sensei
and the little baby.

You wrote " Kubo-sensei
and her baby" here, right?

Why did you write that?

It's okay, Emi. Please answer.

It's a secret.

But you gave this painting
as a gift to Daniel-san.

He doesn't understand,
so why don't you tell him?

It's okay, Emi.

You've done nothing wrong.

But now Daniel-san just
wants to know if there's a baby, okay?

Cute.

Emi, Daniel-san is interested in
the color you painted the baby.

She's like Mickey.

Emi, do you meet Kubo-sensei sometimes?

Emi? Can you tell us where
Kubo-sensei and the baby are?

Emi.

Do you see how you painted this baby
and Mickey-sensei the same color?

That means Daniel-san
and the baby are connected.

And since he's connected to the baby,
he's also connected to Kubo-sensei.

Other people were
connected to Kubo-sensei.

But they talked like she was a bad person.

So she stays away from them.

But Daniel-san is different.

Why?

Because he's Mickey-sensei's father!

A foreigner!

Nakasone-san!

I wish he'd mind his own business...
