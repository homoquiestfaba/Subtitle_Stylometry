Jen! 

2 
Are you OK? 

3 
You have plans for Russell? 

4 
I am. 

5 
You had to finish yesterday. 
I have been delayed. 

6 
You can not afford you. 

7 
Doug, I ... 

8 
I do not feel well. 

9 
I always those dreams. 

10 
I will tell them 
That we need more time. 

11 
I forget thee. You are returned alone? 
Brian brought me back. 

12 
We must call. 

13 
I can go alone. 
No problem. 

14 
You talk college? 
Yes. 

15 
Where? 
In California. 

16 
You talked about Stroudsburg. 

17 
No, you. 

18 
It's a good college, Kevin. 
And it's not far from here. I do not see ... 

19 
I want to remain here. 

20 
Okay? 

21 
The brother of Brian 
Sold his old van. 

22 
Old? 

23 
1991. It sells $ 1200. 
She 215000 km. 

24 
I submit to the state. 
1991? 

25 
Papa and you were in agreement. 

26 
215000 km ... 

27 
Another year and I am breaking from here. 

28 
I have to go. 
Agreed. 

29 
Goodbye, Mrs. Cole. 
Au revoir, Brian. 

30 
What will not? 

31 
It's your dreams? 

32 
Every night for weeks. 

33 
And now, at the office. 

34 
It is not normal 
Dream in broad daylight. 

35 
I do well in math. 

36 
It's my money, Mom. 

37 
After trying 
For so many years. 

38 
I thought there more. 
Me either. 

39 
How? 

40 
Six weeks. 

41 
It's incredible. 

42 
They wanted a second! 
When Kevin was 3 years old. 

43 
It took a little time. 

44 
C'est tout ce que tu me dis? 

45 
What do you want me to tell you? 

46 
What was not anticipated? 

47 
We will organize. 

48 
Our life will change. 

49 
The important thing 
It is to keep a cool head. 

50 
It does not t'angoisse? 

51 
What m'angoisse, 
It is the future of our business. 

52 
It is preparing for the past 20 years. 

53 
And it was 8 months for it. 
If we do not make it, it jeopardises 

54 
Kevin college, 
The new baby and the rest. 

55 
Sleep, dear. 

56 
Look Mommy, 1 shilling! 
I worked longer. 

57 
So, we arrive late. 

58 
I have 2 pence more. 

59 
Keeps 2 pence. 
Cache them. 

60 
The not candy. 

61 
Sonny, you worked hard. 
It's your money. 

62 
I want you to give. 

63 
Okay. 

64 
She looked me. 

65 
I must be crazy, Mom. 

66 
But no, you are not crazy. 
You are pregnant. 

67 
I saw it ... 

68 
Hallucination. 

69 
A church. 

70 
In Ireland, I think. 

71 
Child, you dreamed of Ireland. 

72 
Thou shalt not talking might say. 

73 
Your family Irish 
Exaspérait your father. 

74 
With school, the dreams stopped. 

75 
Your Irish city. 

76 
You draw cards. 

77 
I kept. 

78 
Tu was only 6 years 
When you designed it. 

79 
It prepares the paperwork. 

80 
Where's Daddy? II was to come. 

81 
He had to go 
On the site of Owen. 

82 
Super, eh? 

83 
I have 1200 dollars, 

84 
But I will borrow 

85 
Approximately $ 400 
To change parts. 

86 
Kevin, it was something unexpected. 
Our budget will be tight. 

87 
I bought anyway. 

88 
How unexpected? 

89 
A baby. 

90 
What? 

91 
I am pregnant. 

92 
You gutters? 

93 
I know the past 2 days. 

94 
You are going to be big brother. 

95 
Super! 

96 
Kevin! The papers ... 
Super ... 

97 
That's it? 
Keep. 

98 
Well ... 

99 
Go Sonny! 

100 
Faster! 

101 
Va raise the trap. 

102 
Quick! 

103 
So? 

104 
I must kill him. 

105 
You have taken one or not? 

106 
What do you do, 
Good God? 

107 
What should I do? 

108 
I can not tell you. 

109 
That was your trap. 
It is up to you to decide. 

110 
It is up to you to decide. 

111 
Dépechons! 

112 
Go ... 

113 
File. 

114 
Tell no one. 

115 
If you. 

116 
Promis. 

117 
It is late! 

118 
Come! 

119 
And do not tell her to him. 

120 
Certainly not. 
No, Sonny. Never. 

121 
In person. 

122 
Promis. 

123 
Kevin, your mother a bizarre air. 

124 
Dr. Wickman told me that at age 42, 

125 
It is not as a mother to 24 years. 

126 
But pregnancy goes well, 
It is not worried. 

127 
You must be delighted. 

128 
Yes. 
Yes. 

129 
Mom told me 
That your budget would be tight. 

130 
I forget California, then? 
Correct. 

131 
Super. The baby is not here yet 
It rots my life already. 

132 
Kevin! 

133 
This is not the end of the world. 

134 
For me, though. 
Enough. 

135 
Thank you. 

136 
Tu as he spoke of dreams? 

137 
The doctor said 
It is common in my state. 

138 
But it is not that. 

139 
Listen, Jen, you will tie 
Too much importance. 

140 
Only dreams. 
However, it looks like something else. 

141 
What do you see? 

142 
It's always the same. 

143 
This family in Ireland. 

144 
I did never gone, but ... 

145 
Where does it in Ireland? 
But nowhere. 

146 
Where do you want to come? 

147 
In geography, Doug. 

148 
Very funny, Maggie. 

149 
Please, 
Did not cheer. 

150 
Where do you think it is? 

151 
I do not know. 

152 
You know what? 

153 
I will leave my Oui--ja. 
It can help? 

154 
You realize how much 
It is ridiculous? 

155 
Again. 

156 
Malahide? 

157 
Hello. I am Jenny Cole. 

158 
I just try map 
I commanded. 

159 
Let me see. I return. 

160 
Pardon. 

161 
Apparently, there are four children. 

162 
Sonny is the oldest. 
It a. .. 12 or 13 years. 

163 
She loves her children ... 

164 
But I sense something else ... 

165 
A misfortune. 

166 
This is nonsense. 
No. 

167 
But if! 

168 
I have. 

169 
It is a detailed map 
Malahide and its environs. 

170 
Look. 

171 
The village. This is the same. 

172 
The road ... 

173 
The church. 

174 
The station. 

175 
Roads are identical. 

176 
Look, here Swords Road. 

177 
That's Malahide. 

178 
This design is about you? 

179 
Without knowing Malahide? 

180 
Not. 

181 
Excuse me. 

182 
It exists. 

183 
If Malahide exist ... 

184 
Who are these people that I see? 

185 
Are there too? 

186 
Oh. 

187 
A book by Dr. Christopher Garrison. 

188 
He teaches theology 
At the university. 

189 
And it is hypnothérapeute. 
It speaks of reincarnation. 

190 
No, Mom. 

191 
You have never been to Ireland. 

192 
Child, already, you count was 
Drawings. And it resumes. 

193 
Garrison said that it is not 
Dreams, but memories. 

194 
It's impossible. 

195 
I am not saying that I believe in it. 
But it could help 

196 
Explain what you feel. 

197 
I call you. 

198 
Au revoir. 
Au revoir. 

199 
Money! 

200 
It is where? 

201 
I know you have the money. 
Give it to me, avorton! 

202 
The neighbors hear. 
Well, 

203 
Swords Road m'entende that! 

204 
This is a child! 
The farm! 

205 
Let her! 

206 
You have! 

207 
Huh? 

208 
Come on, give it to me. 

209 
Give it to me! 

210 
Money! 

211 
Are you OK, mom? 

212 
Jen! Congratulations. 
Thank you. 

213 
Let me take you in a store 
Who balance the layette. 

214 
Willingly. 

215 
You have missed the reunion. 

216 
Saturday Casey, the promoter 
5 which builds houses 

217 
And seeking its contractor. 

218 
Do you remember? 
Excuse me. 

219 
I called. 

220 
Where have you been? 

221 
I need you here. 

222 
We have to stall the contract. 

223 
I want to go see somebody. 
Gary? 

224 
Advanced Delivery is at 4. 
No problem. 

225 
Dr. Garrison, a hypnothérapeute. 

226 
Check the measures. 
Agreed. 

227 
It treats anxiety through hypnosis. 

228 
Wickman said that you are well. 
Forget those dreams. 

229 
Souvenirs. 

230 
What? 
Garrison spoke of memories. 

231 
From reincarnation. 

232 
Come in the office. 

233 
He has a doctorate in theology 
And psychology. 

234 
And he believes in reincarnation? 
He talks about past lives. 

235 
He speaks of senseless things. 

236 
I may be ... 

237 
Lrlandaise this. 

238 
This mother. 

239 
But finally, Jen, you realize 
What you are saying now? 

240 
Whether you croies me. 

241 
You just need to understand that you 

242 
That I have to do. 

243 
OUR LIVES EARLIER 

244 
What have you said to Casey? 

245 
Whether you had a tile. 

246 
That there was no more reliable than you. 

247 
That high school already, 

248 
Always expecting you to leave. 

249 
You thought I t'attendais? 

250 
Lls lived Swords Road. 

251 
The lrlandais. 

252 
I heard him in a dream. 

253 
I checked. 

254 
Swords Road exists in Malahide. 

255 
How do I know? 

256 
I know nothing. 
But reincarnation ... 

257 
I come not believe it, Jen. 

258 
There has been a lot of work here. 

259 
If going to see this type 
Can help you forget all that, 

260 
Will be seen. 

261 
I go back to work. 

262 
Unwind. 

263 
You have read my book, 
You know my method. 

264 
I filmed each meeting to 
To be able to come back and analyze it. 

265 
Sometimes, one thing seems 
Insignificant at first glance, 

266 
But it often 
A detail implausible 

267 
Which can be verified. 

268 
Ms. Cole ... 

269 
We need to know 
What you see, 

270 
What you feel. 
Then we can define 

271 
If it is true memories 

272 
Or not. 

273 
Let's go? 

274 
I will count backwards 
5 to 1. 

275 
At 1, you will not hear 
That my voice. 

276 
Five. 

277 
Farther. 

278 
Four. 

279 
Okay. 

280 
Three. Still later. 

281 
Two. 

282 
You are almost. 

283 
Un 

284 
It returned to Ireland. 

285 
It dates from the time 
Of this life in Malahide. 

286 
You are safe, Jenny. 

287 
You are in Malahide? 
Yes. 

288 
You are alone? 
No. 

289 
With whom? 

290 
Two of the children. 

291 
Is everything OK? 

292 
No, it will not. 

293 
There is a problem. 

294 
I will help you, Mom. 

295 
Sonny, is up to your sister. 

296 
Are you OK, Brigdet? 
Mary ... 

297 
Mary, it's not going to? 

298 
Mama! Elizabeth, quickly! 

299 
J'étouffe ... 
Mr. Mullen! 

300 
A glass of water! 

301 
This is surely a boy. 

302 
He agitated! 

303 
Ms. O'Neill. 

304 
Thank you. 

305 
Wood everything. 

306 
Five, four, 

307 
Three, two, 

308 
One. 

309 
Her name is Mary. 

310 
Yes. 

311 
She is also pregnant. 

312 
I would like to schedule 
A series of meetings, 

313 
If you agree 
To continue. 

314 
Worth to go further. 

315 
I propose Tuesday. 

316 
Mary O'Neill ... 

317 
The tuition is more expensive 
If we go out of the state. 

318 
All universities offer 
Multiple student loans. 

319 
But it is not in a position 
Of debt at this time. 

320 
You can spread the payments. 
This is not a solution. 

321 
Kevin can pretend 
Certain scholarships. 

322 
It's an option. 

323 
We can try. 
Sure. 

324 
And maintenance? And journeys? 

325 
It is already doing a lot. 
Some scholarships 

326 
Include pension and trips. 

327 
We targeted these awards then. 

328 
First, 
Universities in the region. 

329 
I want to remain in the region. 

330 
I will find a job. 

331 
I will pay my schooling myself. 

332 
Ms. Cole, 
I understand your concern, 

333 
Kevin, but also 
Say. 

334 
The west coast is a good choice. 

335 
It hurts! 

336 
The Doctor is with you? 
Yes. 

337 
It can help you? 

338 
Come on, Mary, grows. 

339 
That's it. 

340 
A boy. 

341 
A boy! 

342 
It is blue. 

343 
While blue. 

344 
Sorry. 

345 
Oh, my baby ... 

346 
If she is pregnant again, 
She did not survive. 

347 
More child, John. 

348 
You have a beautiful family. 
Four children vigorous. 

349 
You can thank God. 

350 
Five, 

351 
Four, 

352 
Three, 

353 
Two, 

354 
One. 

355 
This is not possible! 

356 
Everything is fine. 

357 
Everything is fine, Jenny. 

358 
Listen, the strength and 
The depth of emotions 

359 
You feel 
Through this woman 

360 
Lead me to think 
It has existed. 

361 
And you can discover 
Who she was ... 

362 
When she lived ... 

363 
Which connects your life 
In his past life. 

364 
These are not dreams. 

365 
These are your memories.

366 
What has? 

367 
It was so small. 

368 
The tiniest babies. 

369 
It was so sad. 

370 
What baby? 

371 
The Mary. 

372 
It was stillborn. 

373 
And it was in my arms. 

374 
I could feel his presence. 

375 
His death fendait me your heart. 

376 
As my own child. 

377 
Calm yourself, Jenny. 

378 
It was my son. 

379 
That was my life. 

380 
Hi. 

381 
Hi. 
You do what? 

382 
I documented on Ireland 
I know when Mary lived. 

383 
Who is it? 

384 
Mary's daughter. Elizabeth. 

385 
When I was a little girl, 

386 
I called all my dolls 
Elizabeth. 

387 
Your grandmother says. 
It's really bizarre. 

388 
Have you reincarnated? 

389 
I can not ignore 
Certain things. 

390 
But I find it difficult to understand. 

391 
Me too. 
But when you were children, 

392 
How you could draw that? 

393 
Papa returned when? 
It is for my car. 

394 
Zut! I forgot. 

395 
The meeting with Sam Casey. 
I am late. 

396 
Hi. 
Hi. 

397 
I want the same spirit 
At Fairview. 

398 
Okay. 

399 
But I want that all 
Be more modern. 

400 
Jenny offers 
Several fronts. 

401 
Parfait. It continues? 
I almost finished. 

402 
How will the business? 
It starts well. 

403 
That's fine, you be launched. 

404 
It had to. 
I know that. 

405 
At the moment, 
It has four worksites. 

406 
It goes far? 

407 
17 

408 
January, 

409 
1932. 

410 
Bravo, Geoffrey. 

411 
Stops, Frank. 
You are going to tear the hem. 

412 
No. 
Si 

413 
You do all your coats. 

414 
This is not true. 
If it's true. 

415 
Why you do that? 
What? 

416 
You do what? 

417 
The hem of the coat of Frank. 

418 
Come rather in the room. 

419 
I can not, John. 
The coat can wait. 

420 
Pose your needle and just. 

421 
No, John. 

422 
I told you to come. 
And I said no! 

423 
Do what I tell you! 
Let her. 

424 
Sonny, no! 

425 
You ... 

426 
Do not make him evil! 

427 
No! Children! 

428 
Come! 

429 
I beg you! 

430 
Jenny, what has? 

431 
What has? 
It is not finished. 

432 
What? 

433 
What is not finished? 

434 
II knew she could no longer 
Have children. She will die. 

435 
It will not die. 
Listen. These people do not exist. 

436 
Even if they existed, 
They are already dead. 

437 
Not. 
They could still be alive. 

438 
How are you? 

439 
I heard Geoffrey said. 
That was in 1932. 

440 
Children ... 

441 
They may be alive. 

442 
Ah, yes. Thank you. 
Thank you for reminding me. 

443 
Not. It is not too late. 
I go to my office. 

444 
Who is it? 

445 
The pastor of the Church of St. Joseph, 
In Malahide. 

446 
Yes, Father Kelly. 

447 
I am trying to find a family 
Who has lived in Malahide circa 1930. 

448 
The O'Neill family. 

449 
The parents called John 
And Mary, they had 4 children. 

450 
I was told that in Ireland 

451 
Registers were kept 
In churches, 

452 
And I hoped 
You may get information 

453 
On this family. 

454 
It is 3 h. 

455 
Can you send me an e--mail? 

456 
Jenny ... 

457 
You are not computerized. 

458 
Who can do research? 

459 
No, I understand my father. 

460 
Thanks anyway. 

461 
The courier. 

462 
What is it? 

463 
I wrote to O'Neill 14 
In the region of Malahide. 

464 
None of them knows Mary. 

465 
You told them as your dreams? 
No. 

466 
But I said that was important. 

467 
But then, 
Jenny you are or you are Mary? 

468 
That is what I believe: 

469 
I am the revival of Mary. 

470 
I was Mary, 
But today, I am Jenny. 

471 
How she died? 
I do not know. 

472 
But memories become clearer. 

473 
Why? 
According to Garrison, 

474 
Souls who rise quickly 

475 
Feel the need to complete 
What is left unfinished. 

476 
I know it concerns children. 

477 
But I do not know what. 

478 
He had a beautiful wife 

479 
A pretty woman 

480 
She wanted a child 

481 
He had a beautiful child 

482 
He had a beautiful child. 

483 
I love it. 
And you sing so well. 

484 
I like it too. 
That is why you will sing! 

485 
Wait! 

486 
You should be extended. 

487 
We need rest. 

488 
No, I need my children. 

489 
It soon. 

490 
You are going to call it? 

491 
Gregory for a boy ... 

492 
Phyllis for a girl. 

493 
Give me a sister. 

494 
I will try. 

495 
Sonny ... 

496 
If ever ... 

497 
Everything will be fine. 

498 
Thou shalt take care of them. 

499 
Stop. 

500 
Everything will go well. 

501 
You are the eldest. 

502 
Promise me that children 
Remain together. 

503 
Promis. 

504 
What has? 

505 
I got burned. 

506 
I had their minds elsewhere. 
Are you OK? 

507 
Mom ... 
She knew she was going to die. 

508 
What would leave 
With the animal. 

509 
She promised to Sonny 
To watch over the children. 

510 
Despite my research, 

511 
I can not 
To trace them. 

512 
Excuse me. Hello. 

513 
You had to go? 

514 
I took 

515 
3 airfares. 

516 
You will all go to Ireland. 

517 
What? 

518 
You have to finish. For you, 
But for Doug and Kevin. 

519 
They need you. 

520 
You are right. I live in the past. 

521 
I am absent. 

522 
You are going to have a baby. 
You have to be there. 

523 
Find what happened to Mary 
And her children then resume your life. 

524 
Oh, Mom ... 

525 
Thank you. 

526 
And the hotel? And the meals? 

527 
And the car? 
We will get there. 

528 
Jenny, you are pregnant! 

529 
Dr. Wickman is in agreement. 
And our case? 

530 
Suzanne and Gary are there. 
You call every day. 

531 
No question. 

532 
I find nothing here. 
Thou shalt not find anything there. 

533 
I go. 
So, you go alone. 

534 
With me. 

535 
You are all crazy? 

536 
Listen, you are Jenny Cole, 

537 
Not Mary O'Neill. 

538 
Your son is Kevin, 
Sonny or not Frank. 

539 
It was at this family there 
I believe that. 

540 
It is my life to me. 
I think not reincarnation! 

541 
So, you think not me. 

542 
Welcome to Malahide. 

543 
There is. 

544 
You know really where is the hotel? 
It must be there. 

545 
It's bad side. 

546 
Pardon! 

547 
Go ahead. 

548 
It is still there. 

549 
What? 
The slaughter. 

550 
Wait! 

551 
And the hotel? 

552 
It's crazy. 

553 
Look! 

554 
Lls came there every Sunday. 

555 
Hello. Can I help you? 

556 
Hello. I am Jenny Cole. 

557 
Here is my son Kevin. 
I have been on the phone. 

558 
Yes. Ravi you know. 
Hello, Kevin. 

559 
You come to see the records? 
If possible. 

560 
Come, I will drive there. 

561 
The O'Neill is your family? 

562 
Not exactly. 

563 
So? 

564 
You find? 
No. 

565 
Sorry. 
Me too. 

566 
You have called 
Archives Dublin? 

567 
Yes. They have nothing. 

568 
Are you sure 
Swords Road where they lived? 

569 
Yes. 

570 
Malahide is a small town. 
Ask the people. 

571 
It should be there at the corner. 

572 
That tells you something? 

573 
It Swords Road. 

574 
Their house should be there. 
Are you sure? 

575 
Somewhere there. 

576 
It's been a very long time. 
They seem to have everything demolished. 

577 
Excuse me. 

578 
I am Jenny Cole, I seek 
A family who lived here. 

579 
Excuse me, 
I am looking for the O'Neill family. 

580 
Excuse me. My mother and I ... 

581 
Nobody knows. 

582 
It has not yet 
Asked everyone. 

583 
It seems as if. 

584 
Mom? 

585 
I return. 

586 
Hello. I am Jenny Cole. 

587 
The United States, right? 

588 
It is your accent. 

589 
I reside at Dunleavy Inn. 
You live here? 

590 
Yes. 

591 
Tell me ... 

592 
Ask your question still. 

593 
I am looking for the O'Neill family. 

594 
John and Mary. 

595 
They lived Swords Road circa 1930. 

596 
They had 4 children: Sonny, 
Geoffrey, Frank and Elizabeth. 

597 
I can not help you. 

598 
I arrived at Malahide in 1952. 

599 
I just Killybegs, in the north. 

600 
Thank you. 

601 
We are going where? 
Back to Swords Road. 

602 
I will reapply. 

603 
Calm yourself, Phyllis. 

604 
I took him. 

605 
I love you 

606 
So. 

607 
Know that ... Wherever you are ... 

608 
I shall always on you. 

609 
What do you have? 
You are returned to full inside. 

610 
I had not seen. 

611 
Rest here, okay? I can straighten it. 

612 
Excuse us. 

613 
She has not seen slow. 

614 
Are you OK? 

615 
I look for them. 

616 
Papa, it's Kevin. 

617 
Hi, Kev. Everything is going well? 

618 
Not really. It was an accident. 

619 
Mom was driving. 

620 
It goes far? And you? 

621 
Yes, we have nothing. 

622 
How it happened? 

623 
There was a stop sign, 
But she continued. 

624 
She was totally elsewhere. 
Like the other day in Brian. 

625 
It is there? 

626 
It is at the hotel, she sleeps. 
It happened just a few hours. 

627 
You find? 

628 
No, nothing. 

629 
Nothing at all? 
No. 

630 
Enter immediately at home. 

631 
No, Dad. 

632 
Why? 
I saw the church. 

633 
Which church? 
Here. 

634 
The Mary. 
The mother has drawn. 

635 
Kevin ... 
It has drawn 

636 
Because she had already seen. 

637 
We need you to come. 

638 
She needs you. 

639 
I know nothing ... 

640 
I was asleep. 
Yes. It's going better? 

641 
Yes. 

642 
I am going to leave you to the steering wheel. 

643 
Your father was perhaps right. 

644 
What can be done? 
Back to Swords Road. 

645 
You are losing our time. 

646 
Call all O'Neill. 
It has already done. 

647 
Return consult the records. 

648 
There was no trace of a Mary 
O'Neill who lived in Malahide. 

649 
It has tried everything. 

650 
I will walk. At just now. 

651 
Okay. 

652 
Ms. Cole! 

653 
It falls well. 

654 
Arthur McSweeney. 

655 
It was seen at the port this morning. 

656 
With the accident, I was worried. 

657 
I am fine. 

658 
I called a few friends. 
Here Thomas Layden. 

659 
Enchanté. 

660 
Thomas grew up a few houses 
The family you are looking for. 

661 
I knew Sonny. 

662 
Everything that was in the marshes. 

663 
And there was a river 
A little higher. 

664 
Today it is dried up 
Like me. 

665 
But first, 
It would seek water. 

666 
You live where? 
After the river. 

667 
There were how many families? 
Twenty. 

668 
It formed a small neighborhood. 

669 
Therein lies. 

670 
Beware of branches. 
There is almost. 

671 
They lived here. 

672 
If she is pregnant again, 
She did not survive. 

673 
I said no! 
Do what I tell you! 

674 
Let her! 

675 
Sonny, no! 

676 
Wherever you are, 

677 
I shall always on you. 

678 
Remember your promise. 

679 
Remember your promise. 

680 
They went where after his death? 
I have ever known. 

681 
They have lived here? 
Yes. 

682 
There were Sutton, 
The Duffy, Brennan ... 

683 
The Sutton? 

684 
Her name Sutton? 

685 
Not O'Neill? 

686 
Sutton. John and Mary Sutton. 

687 
MARY SUTTON, 37 YEARS 
DÉCÉDÉE THE 24--10--1932 

688 
This is Mary. 

689 
You have found. 

690 
You have failed. 

691 
You too. 

692 
Greatly. 

693 
Mr. Layden said that children 

694 
Were all baptized here. 

695 
If you have the right name, 
We will find them. 

696 
Come, there are others nearby. 

697 
Searching for a family 
That is not yours? 

698 
The Catholic Church does not believe 
To the reincarnation. 

699 
Not. But that does not mean 
She does not believe in miracles. 

700 
When things happen. 

701 
Here's what I think. 

702 
The soul does not die. 

703 
I do not think 
It can be reborn, 

704 
But it is possible, 
In rare circumstances, 

705 
She speaks 
Through another. 

706 
The soul of this woman asks you 
To regain her children. 

707 
I am not talking about reincarnation. 

708 
That is my interpretation. 

709 
That's it! 

710 
I baptismal certificates. 

711 
Yes, that's right. 

712 
Children of John and Mary Sutton. 

713 
They are five: 

714 
Phyllis, Elizabeth, 

715 
Frank, Geoffrey 

716 
And John Junior. 
It Sonny. 

717 
I know of no Sonny Sutton. 

718 
It is not in my parish. 

719 
And the others either. 

720 
It will not. 

721 
This is not necessarily Sonny 
Which put flowers on his grave. 

722 
Although, I am sure. 

723 
Inevitably. 

724 
I almost scared to see it. 

725 
I am afraid to come applecart his life. 

726 
Back to the hotel. 

727 
We will return tomorrow. Viens. 

728 
Go ahead, you. 

729 
I still have a few. 

730 
Mr. Sutton? 

731 
Mr Sutton! 

732 
Sonny? 

733 
I know you? 

734 
I know you. 

735 
I know your mother, your father. 

736 
Your brothers and sisters. 
You know my family? 

737 
You live Swords Road. 

738 
You cross the bay 
To work in the fields. 

739 
Your mother was waiting for you 
When you return. 

740 
Who are you? 

741 
Sorry, I will take wrong. 
I am Jenny Cole. 

742 
I come from Allentown, 
Pennsylvania. 

743 
I remember your family 
Through dreams that I do. 

744 
Dreams? 
I want to talk about it. 

745 
Please ... 
I just want to talk to you. 

746 
But I do not want to. 

747 
I know it seems strange, but ... 

748 
I wanted to make sure that you and 
Your brothers and sisters go well. 

749 
I do not know where they are. 

750 
I have not seen for 65 years. 

751 
But I thought ... 
I do not know. 

752 
I do not know you. 

753 
I will not talk about my family. 
Neither you nor anyone. 

754 
You tell me know. This is false. 

755 
Totally untrue. 

756 
You freed the rabbit. 

757 
Your mother was pregnant. 

758 
In slaughter 
With Elizabeth and you, 

759 
She had a malaise 
And you have to 

760 
And took his hand. 

761 
One woman asked for water. 

762 
The butcher has pushed a drink 
Saying, Ms. O'Neill. 

763 
And your mother took the glass. 

764 
I thought she was called O'Neill. 

765 
How do you know his life 
As if you had lived? 

766 
The father believes Kelly 
It is the soul of Mary 

767 
Who speaks through me. 

768 
Now that I have the right name, 
We can find the others. 

769 
You can ask them 
Malahide to come to ... 

770 
I do not know what all this means, 

771 
But it's too late now. 
Too late. 

772 
Wait, Sonny! 

773 
I can not see them. 

774 
I had Frank on the phone. 
He will be there tomorrow morning. 

775 
We talked about you. 

776 
There certainly not believed. 
Correct. 

777 
But he wants to see his family. 
And Sonny? 

778 
II 1 hour drive each 
Week for the fall bloom. 

779 
But he does not want to come. 

780 
I do not know why. 

781 
There they are. 

782 
She is the one. 

783 
Let's welcome him. 

784 
Elizabeth Sutton? 

785 
Yes. 
Hello. I am the father Kelly. 

786 
Enchantée, my father. 

787 
I have spoken to Mrs. Cole. 

788 
Enchantée, Mrs Cole. 

789 
Call me Jenny. 

790 
You can call me Bessie. 

791 
Bessie. 

792 
Hi, Sonny. 

793 
I can speak? 

794 
You remember my father? 

795 
Very bad memories. 

796 
Even today, 

797 
I hold responsible 
The death of my mother. 

798 
I have long been afraid of him 
And souvenirs. 

799 
Today, I complain. 

800 
He had a wonderful family ... 

801 
He did not know the love and enjoy. 

802 
I heard my mother talk. 

803 
Sonny, I came to tell you 

804 
We found 
Your brothers and sisters. 

805 
But Geoffrey died 
10 years ago. 

806 
We have his death certificate. 

807 
The others are alive. 

808 
Phyllis lives in Wexford 
In recent years. 

809 
It happens tonight. 

810 
Elizabeth arrived 
Kilkenny this morning. 

811 
And Frank arrives tomorrow in England. 

812 
On a visit to church. 

813 
Not. No, Ms. Cole ... 

814 
Why do you do? 

815 
After the death of mother, 

816 
Dad sent us all 
In the fields. 

817 
As daily. 

818 
Small did not arrive, 

819 
Then he struck. 

820 
He was always drunk 
Or angry. 

821 
One night, 
When he was drunk death 

822 
I have taken to the orphanage. 

823 
The orphanage has accepted, 
But I think I was too big. 

824 
Sonny ... 

825 
I knew that the component, 
I do retrouverais ever. 

826 
But I embraced 
Without telling them. 

827 
I ran away. 

828 
I left there. 

829 
I returned 
A few years after. 

830 
I felt so guilty. 

831 
But Dublin was so great. 

832 
With so many people. 

833 
I had no money, 
I did not know where to look. 

834 
I have betrayed my promise. 

835 
I betrayed everyone. 

836 
She was desperate, 

837 
You have asked for the same. 

838 
You do not have a choice. 

839 
I promised him 

840 
That the children would remain together. 

841 
Keep that promise today. 

842 
Come to church. 

843 
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Cole. 

844 
Father Kelly is there. 
With Elizabeth. 

845 
And I see Phyllis. 

846 
Tell them ... 
What you get? 

847 
Everything will be fine. 

848 
Détends up, Mom. 
You pay me nervous. 

849 
Everything will be fine. 

850 
What? 

851 
Mary felt guilty if 
Abandoning her children 

852 
Not to be there for them. 

853 
So I wanted 
Keep you close to me. 

854 
She has not seen her children grow up. 

855 
I am lucky. 

856 
You should go in California. 

857 
I thought rather 
Make my first year 

858 
Pennsylvania. 

859 
On weekends, 
I will be a big brother 

860 
And I can also help. 

861 
I would go elsewhere later. 

862 
Nothing t'y oblige. 

863 
I know. 

864 
Let's go. 

865 
My God, Frank? 

866 
Certainly. Let's go. 

867 
Phyllis. Elizabeth. 

868 
After all these years, I thought 
That there would be more. 

869 
What you have done is wonderful. 

870 
No matter how. 

871 
It's wonderful. 

872 
I am so happy. 
Me too. 

873 
The farm McConnel 
Is on the other side. 

874 
I was going to work 
When I was 9 years old. 

875 
I still see my mother 
Meanwhile here 

876 
Our return. 

877 
Thank you. 

878 
Thank you for bringing us together. 

879 
Since 2 days, I realized 

880 
That all memories 
Are not painful. 

881 
Sometimes 
Before I go to work, 

882 
My mother and I 

883 
Doing a tour of boat 
On the bay. 

884 
There were only two of us, 
On the water, 

885 
At sunrise. 

886 
It was so quiet ... 

887 
If beautiful ... 

888 
You should remembered. 

889 
Yes! 

890 
When I grow up ... 

891 
I will be how? 

892 
Some people believe 
It shows that from birth, 

893 
That man look 
To the child he was. 

894 
Thou shalt be as the boy 
That you are today. 

895 
Gentil. Attentionné. 

896 
Who loves people 
And that people love. 

897 
I am so proud of you. 

898 
I love you with all my heart. 

899 
And I always t'aimerai. 

900 
So, you go where? 
At Penn State or Bloomsburg. 

901 
Bloomsburg! 

902 
Why? 
It's closer. It was the job. 

903 
Doug! 

904 
My angel! 

905 
My Allison ... 

906 
Kevin takes care of you. 

907 
Oh, I go. 

908 
Hi. 
Hi. 

909 
Hi, Grandma. In later. 

910 
You have mail. 

911 
Take Allison. 

912 
Dear Jenny, 

913 
I received a photo of Allison 
This morning, 

914 
I wanted to congratulate you 
For this beautiful baby. 

915 
I see the next summer, 
When you come. 

916 
Franck, Bettie 

917 
Phyllis and come too. 

918 
And they come as a family, 
This time. 

919 
I am happy 
To be part of your life. 

920 
I have lost once, 
As a child. 

921 
I do not want to 
You lose again. 

922 
I also send you a photograph. 

923 
It was between the pages 

924 
Of a book. 

925 
This is a picture of my mother. 
I wish you have. 

926 
Write soon. 

927 
Sonny.
