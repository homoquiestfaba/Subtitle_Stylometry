They know where you are.

[thunder rumbling]


God forgive us.

[dramatic music]

[engine humming]

Where's the boss?

He doesn't want
to be seen with us.

Doesn't want to be seen at all.

He doesn't fly anymore.

-[speaking foreign

-You in?

Jesus Christ!

There's a lot
of names on that list.

Not my territory.

The production
is under our mandate.

Earl contained zero visibility.

See? You're welcome.

Stella?

[Stella speaking on phone]

Gremlin.

They'll never go for this.

It's not their money.

They're paying more,

because they think
they can duplicate our work.

They've tried and failed.

Just like their presidents.

[all chuckling]

[Stella speaking
foreign language on phone]

[indistinct radio chatter]

Now they're putting us up

at the huge spire tower deal,

room service...

...whatever else they bring us.

Gentlemen and lady, we're
starting our approach to Dubai.

It's going to be a
little bumpy going in there.

There's a little chop in the
air, so, uh, sit back, relax.

We'll be in Dubai
within ten minutes, 12 minutes.

Thank you very much.


[dramatic music continues]

[engine humming]

[faint indistinct radio chatter]

Gentlemen...

...they have agreed
to the unit price.

Boom.

At the premium?

Mid 11 figures,

if our lab can deliver on time,

which we'll see.

Are they selling them for parts?

You know me.
I wouldn't allow it.

Do they know who they're
selling them to? We did

-some trials there.
-Do any of you actually know

why we tested our products?

It's time.

Right now. This is his vision

-for global security.
-There are still ethical issues.

Stella, why isn't he here?

You know why.

We all know
where he stands, so to speak.

Remember what he inherited.

Right? He turned this all around

from a R&D death spiral,

into our mighty God...

...prophet.

I still find him
to be a God damned magician.

We owe him this.

Our savior, his swan song

to the highest bidder.

We have quorum.


So...

...let's make
some fucking money.

[faint indistinct radio chatter]

[player chuckles]

Taking food off
our kids' tables?

You go fuck yourself.

[thud on table]


Last time you work on this boat.

You're gonna need

Let me go!

Please.

So there's

this new pub up the road,

hot bartender, got curly hair.

Help you, outlaw?

Paying our boy rise.

See you in a couple months.

You knew you wouldn't kill him.

Yeah, don't have

I'll square you away tomorrow.

Hey, thanks, doc.

Sorry, friend.

So where is he?

Somewhere.

Pretending to be a man.

What a fool.

Oh, you have no idea.

Well, he better be home soon.

A boy?

Oh, that's pretty smart,

So, um, probably a...

Girl.

Lucky lady.

Oh, yeah. You have no idea.

How about I keep you company?

Both of you.

-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

-So--
-Forever.

So...

[Aubrey laughing]

[tender music]

Come inside.

What are you looking for?

Huh?

-[whispering] You.
-[chuckles]

Where did you go this time?

I don't remember.

You left too.


Is work.


Did you miss me?

[moans and chuckles]

I guess you did.

Don't move.

I like your face.


Who are you?

Who is the man behind that face?

[camera clicks]

Hey. Where are you?

Right now.

Everything is...

We should run...

[camera clicks]

Where?

Where haven't you been?

Everywhere without you.

That can change.

Where do you want to go?

Somewhere we can start over...

Yeah, but somewhere
nobody knows who we are.

For how long?

Days...

Ah!

Forever.

I'm serious.

[camera clicks]

I'm serious.

Do you love me...

...or the idea of me?

Lots of men, some women...

...they like the idea of me.

I don't wanna share you
with anyone.

So you're greedy.

[camera clicks]

Do you trust me?

It's only been a few months.

You don't know me.

[camera clicks]

It's long enough.

I might break your heart.

Maybe.

-Maybe not.
-[camera clicks]


Where?

Tell you.


How did you know?

It's not hard.


I remember everything.

Just you and me.

Nobody else.

You should pack.

I bought those
tickets for six.

Plenty of time.

[reflexive music]


Keep going.

Again?

It might move things along.


[dark music]


Come out.

[Abigail chuckles]

-Come out.
-[chuckles]

Come out.

Hey, there you are.

Any day now.

That's what they said.

Do you tell me if I ask?

I don't remember.


He is so much bigger now.

He?

Shit.

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

I thought we said
it was going to be a surprise.

Surprise.

[both chuckle]

It's a boy.

You got any name ideas?

Not yet.

I was waiting for you.

Aren't you sweet?


[sighs softly]

Are you ready for this?

Yeah.

I'm going to sell the tug.

Get a piece of property.

One more season, and--

You're not going anywhere.

I got to get my draw out, babe.

I mean,
you aren't going anywhere.

You aren't afraid of this?

If I left...

...he'd kill me.

I'm serious.

There is nowhere else
for me but here.

Nowhere in the world.

-That's not true.

I don't even

[gun cocking]

Get out.

Please.

I'll explain.

Do you wanna know?

Ask.

Who are you?

A thief?

No.

What's the gun for?

Do you... kill people?


Do you work for the government?

I don't know.

It's one man.

Minnie, I don't know.

I have--

I had to.

They saved me...

...a long time ago.

From what?

Babe, I don't remember.

But they invested a lot
of time into making me who I am.

A contract killer?

I had no choice.

But that's over.

Yes...

...it is.

We gotta go.

Please come with me.

Are we can running
from these people?

No.

Nobody's after me...

...or us.

I'm running away with you.

Who is that?

It's just a name.

You know me.

So your real name is...

...Michael?

And only...

...two people
in the world know that.

Lucky me.

I'm sorry.

But you know me.

Nobody else does.

You do.

Only you.

Okay?

[mysterious music]

Get rid of that.

I'll pack.

Michael?

You're mine now.

[man in chair]
Who are you?

Who are you?

Who are you?

Fuck you!

[man in chair]
Here you are.

[grunting and panting]

You don't look like a Peter.

You look like...

...a Michael.


[man in chair]
But you do, and I you.

But do you know you?

Casa Blanca?

Last year?

Jakarta...

...single shot...

...900 meters

at night. Hmm.

And she knew you.

She could see

who you are.

Now, why is that?

It seems like the only person

who doesn't know you is...

...you.

Would you like to know?

Just kill me.

[man in chair]
There is still
time to break you.

Start with the water.

No, no, no!

Ah! No! No!

[eerie music]

[grunting and yelling]


[man in chair]
That's a record.

I've broken so many before you.

You were the last
of this brave breed.

The strongest, clearly.

I have a schedule, Michael.

And I got all the time

in the world, you piece of shit.

[man in chair]
I wonder how long she lasted...

...under the water.

Go to hell.

Who were they?

Who were they?

Two days, that's all I need.

You killed them.

You killed all of them like,

like you had done that before.

Have you?

Don't use
a landline at the farm.

Who are you?

Call me when you get there.

You'll be safe.

Tell me the truth...

...or there is no us!

You can, you know.

Just let me in.

I'll tell you everything...

...after.

This is happening any day now,

and you can't
leave us like this.

Please, what are you doing?

You two are going,

and I'm gonna follow.

Take this.

Somebody sits
next to you... move.

We'll go.

We will...

...but you have
to tell me who you are.

Really.

[dark music]

What you saw, what I--

What I did...

-Aha.
-...he's gone.

I killed him a long time ago.

Not supposed to exist anymore.

Anywhere. You understand?

I do.

And so do you.

And now so does he.

I have to find out
how they found me.

They are gonna kill you.

You saw what I did?

Mm-hmm.

I have to make sure that...

...they never find us again.

Our son needs his father...

...which is you.

[ominous music]

<i>Two days.</i>


I promise.


You come back to me.

Two days.


That's all.

I love you.

I love you.

Fuck.

Oh!

[somber music]

[man in chair]
Open your eyes, Michael.


Time to find out who you are.

Why?

Why are you doing this?

[man in chair]
To show you.

We are the same.

The same man.

Can't you see?

We are nothing alike!

[man in chair]
You're wrong,

more than you know.

There is more of my life
in you than you can comprehend.

What are you talking about?

[man in chair]
The pain you feel is nothing

compared to what I've endured.

The toll you
have had on my life...

...all of you.


[man in chair]
We don't have time
for that, Michael.

He is prepared
to earn another day of life.

-Are you?
-Who's he?

[man in chair]
The truth, Michael.

-[Michael] Who is he?
-[man in chair] The truth.

-Who is he? Ah!
-[man in chair]
Show me who you are.

Show yourself.

[intense punching and grunting]


[bones cracking]

[yelling and panting]

Is this what you want?

[man in chair]
Yes. Every time

one of them dies,
you are reborn.

Don't you see?

You are worth more to me now.

You are only
alive because of me.

Never forget that.

No.

Why did you kill her?

[man in chair]
No, my dear boy, you killed her.

Had you done what I asked,
she would be alive.

She knew nothing!

[man in chair]
She knew your face,

your body, your touch...

...and she knew your real name.

She was innocent.

[man in chair]
She was, until she met you.

Every day, you killed her.

Again, and again, and again.

-Shut up!
-And again,

-and again.
-Shut up. Shut the fuck up!


[man in chair]
Your rage is bleeding

with truth.

Don't you see?

You failed her as you failed me.

You betrayed us all.

I did. I...

I killed her.

It was my fault.

[somber music]

[man in chair]
And all of these.

I killed them.
[breathes heavily]

I killed them all.

[man in chair]
You are not a lover,

nor a husband,

a father, or a son.

You are nothing to this world,

but everything to me.

Why am I alive?

[man in chair]
I needed you.

You were always
my favorite, Michael.

Don't you remember?

I can show you
who you really are.

Do I have a choice?

[man in chair]
You can die tonight,

a forgotten domino

like the rest of the world,

or I can let you live.

I wanna live.

Please.

Please, I do.

[man in chair]
In my shadow?

Working for me?

Yes.

[man in chair]
Your blind loyalty?

Yes.

[man in chair]
I can't hear you, Michael.

Yes.

[man in chair]
Your forgiveness?

You have it.

[man in chair]
You see,
you are a killer, Michael.

An animal born in a cage.

And your freedom

is this final target.

Someday you will thank me

for this gift of anonymity.

Look at me.

[silencer shooting]

[dark music intensifies]

My son.

You've changed.

A man knows
when he is growing old

when he looks like his father.

I knew you'd find me again.

It was worth it...

...waiting for you.

After all this time...

...why did you come for me?

Because I'm selfish...

...and weak.

I had to see you.

I betrayed you, Michael.

Yesterday.

Years ago.

Who did this to you?

They exiled me,
Michael, from my work.

I'm a banished king,

protected every second.

Even from myself.

We agreed.

We agreed...

...to end this

when I paid my debt.

It should have ended with you,

the first one.

The only one
that mattered to me.

You promised me.

You promised me my freedom.

No, no, my boy,

I promised you anonymity

to make you stronger.

And, look,

you're alive.

I turned you into something

I never intended.

From a man...

...into...

...an animal.

Oh, it was my mistake

to pretend to be God.

I don't care.

You were the only one

who knew who I was.

You still don't
understand who you are.

Who am I?

You came into the world alone.

I took you away.

What I did I had to do.

For the work, I needed you...

...to be.

What is you talking about?

I am not the father you deserve.

I made you...

...but I am not him.

But I was your only family.

Not anymore.

What are you saying?

I have a family of my own.

Impossible.

I am not the animal
you think I am.

A wife?

Tell me her name.

Abigail.

Abigail...

...like the raging wind.

We can end this together.

What do I need to do?

Step out of the shadows

you have worked so hard

to shroud yourself within.

You run.

Stay alive.

There is nothing there

-for you.
-Help me.

Help me, damn you.

In your beginning...

...is your end, Michael.

No man remembers...

...the day he was born,

but his father does.

You were born...

...October 3rd...

...1973.

Where?

Where I took you

so many years ago...

...before you
were taken from me.

Seek yourself...

...in the darkness.

Who am I?

I tried to love you.

Forgive me, my boy.

Once more...

...unto the bridge...

...and after...

...kill them all.

And ghosts

will die, and you,

you will live

in the light...

...once more.

Unto the bridge once...

...once...

...once, more.

Once more

unto the bridge.

<i>-He's here.</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

[baby crying]

<i>What's your name?</i>

[Abigail's voice echoing]

<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>to tell me who you are.</i>

<i>What's your name?</i>

<i>Who were they?</i>

<i>You killed them.</i>

<i>You killed all of them</i>
<i>like you've done that before.</i>

<i>Who are you?</i>

<i>Tell me the truth...</i>

<i>...or there is no us.</i>

<i>Just let me in.</i>

<i>Where I took you</i>

<i>so many years ago.</i>

<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>I killed him a long time ago.</i>

<i>He's not supposed</i>
<i>to exist anymore.</i>

<i>This baby needs his father,</i>

<i>which is you.</i>

<i>They are gonna kill you.</i>

<i>We have to make sure</i>

<i>they'll never find us.</i>

<i>Come back to me.</i>

<i>It was my mistake...</i>

<i>...to pretend to be God.</i>

<i>Who am I?</i>

[ominous music continues]

[metallic slashing]

[silencer shooting]

[mysterious music]

[door creaking]

[mysterious music continues]

<i>You were born October 3rd...</i>

<i>...1973.</i>

[lock clicking]

[door clicking]

[eerie music]


<i>I betrayed you, Michael.</i>

<i>Yesterday.</i>

<i>Years ago.</i>

[silent scream]

[speaking foreign language]


[ominous music]


[ominous music intensifies]

<i>I knew you were going to be</i>

<i>of consequence to this world,</i>

<i>capable of doing things</i>

<i>no other man could,</i>

<i>capable of anything.</i>

<i>Remember, my boy,</i>
<i>you are the ripple</i>

<i>of my creation.</i>

<i>Hear me now.</i>

<i>Use your gifts for good.</i>

<i>Never forget</i>
<i>where you came from...</i>

<i>...who you really are.</i>

<i>I tried to love you.</i>

<i>Forgive me, my boy.</i>

[silencer shooting]

[silencer shooting]

[silencer shooting]


[man in chair]
We few...


...we happy few...

...we band of brothers.

I know you.

Do you remember me?


Do you remember our beginning?

And how he found his muse?

And he made you...

<i>...a bastard...</i>

...from poor breeding.

<i>I died when you</i>
<i>came into this world.</i>

<i>He made you better in every way.</i>

[eerie music]

Our father was no God.

He was a broken man...

...a stupid, blind man.

You were special.

He couldn't see it.

He was blind to your true worth,

your only real
value in this world.

I saw opportunity

in his creation...

...profit

in your profession.


So I took him apart...

...piece by piece,

<i>His company, share by share.</i>

Killed his dream, life by life.

Look around.

Do you see?

Do you see?

In the vessel of his creation...

...the whore...

...that bore his only bastard.

My first kill
was long before yours.

[gunshot echoing]



You...

...you God damned coward.

He knew who you were.

He knew nothing about me!

You're wrong.

He knew...


...what you would become.

And he...

...he wished...

...you didn't exist.

He asked me...

...begged me...

...his only...

...son...

...for one last job.

The promise of my freedom...

...the...

...price...

...to be forgotten.

You know what that was?

You.

You liar.

But I...

...I couldn't take
my own life...

...even yours.


...I paid for it.

You found me...

...but remember?

I let you.

I...

...let you...

...live.

Oh.

And for he
that outlives this day

and comes safe
home shall be my brother.

No, you...

...you are nothing to me.

And you...

...were never real...

...just the echoing dream...

...of a delusional man.

But thank you for killing him.

Thank you.

I planned his death the moment

I knew his weakness.

You.

And now...

...you become...

...a ghost.

[eerie music intensifies]






[somber music]




Put me down.

Put me down.

[groaning and panting]

[somber music]

Hey.

<i>Hey you.</i>

<i>-Where are you?</i>
-Somewhere...

...pretending to be a man.

<i>Are you okay?</i>

Yeah, yeah, I'm--

I, uh--

Can I hear him?

<i>He's sleeping.</i>

<i>You should be here.</i>

What's his name?
[breathes heavily]

<i>We'll decide together.</i>

<i>Come home.</i>

I'm on my way.


You...

...look at me.

You find her...

...you tell her.

Tell her everything.

She deserves to know.

Do tell her, tell her...

[panting and stuttering]

...start from the beginning,
but tell her.

Show her.

He...

...he...

...he can't ever know about me.

[breathes heavily]

[somber music]

<i>He can't ever know about me.</i>

[man in chair]
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

<i>Time to find out who you are.</i>

<i>The only person</i>
<i>who doesn't know you is...</i>

<i>...you.</i>

<i>We are the same.</i>

<i>The same man.</i>

<i>Can't you see?</i>

<i>There is more of my life</i>
<i>in you than you can comprehend.</i>

<i>The pain you feel is nothing</i>

<i>compared to what I've endured.</i>

<i>The toll you</i>
<i>have had on my life...</i>

<i>...all of you.</i>

<i>He is prepared</i>
<i>to earn another day of life.</i>

<i>Are you?</i>

<i>Every time one of them dies,</i>

<i>you are reborn.</i>

<i>You are only</i>
<i>alive because of me.</i>

<i>Never forget that.</i>

<i>I've broken so many before you.</i>

<i>You were the last</i>
<i>of this brave breed.</i>

<i>The strongest, clearly.</i>

<i>This is who you are.</i>

<i>This is what you will always be.</i>

<i>So I took him apart...</i>

<i>...piece by piece.</i>

<i>Killed his dream, life by life.</i>

<i>Now, look around.</i>

<i>Do you see?</i>

<i>It was my mistake...</i>

<i>...to pretend to be God.</i>

[somber music]

[man in chair]
<i>Do you see?</i>

[somber music continues]

[somber music]

[car door shuts]

This is, uh...

It's for you.

He, uh...

He wanted you to see the truth.


I'm...

I'm sorry.

He was a good man?

Please.

I have so many questions.

Come inside?

You can meet him.

[somber music continues]

It's okay.

Go ahead.

He thinks...

...he knows you.
