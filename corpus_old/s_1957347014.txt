[wind whooshing]

[theme music]

Damn.

[keys clanking]

[birds chirping]

As we enter spring semester,

I would like to extend my heartiest congratulations

to our own Dean Pecarino,

for making the Prestigious Dean's List

of Who's Who in American High schools.

[tepid applause]

Thank you, thank you.


Thank you.

Thanks a lot.

Now let's hear it for the Condors,

winners of the North Coast championship!

[upbeat music]

[cheerleaders cheering]


â™ª You might get a shot

â™ª I'll be your honey, maybe for the night â™ª

â™ª Sweet dreams, you'll have them â™ª

â™ª The rest of your life

â™ª Go on, think it over, Rover

â™ª Go on, think it over, Rover

[students cheering] â™ª You won't believe this

Okay. Okay.

Now let's give it up for our all league quarterback

headed straight for UCLA,

Eric Hood!

[students cheering]

That's my man! That's my man!

Thanks, thanks again.

Now it's my pleasure to turn things over

to our Commander in Chief, Dean Joe Pecarino.

Dean,

you the man.

[Joe laughing]

Thanks Brad. Thanks.

[lone student clapping] For many of you - thank you.

This will be your final semester, namely you seniors.


[students cheering]

Seniors rule!

Okay, okay.

Settle down!

One of the great traditions we have here at Tres Rios

is the Outstanding Teenagers of America scholarship

given annually to an outstanding senior.

Deadline's just a week away.

I advise all interested parties to apply forthwith.

All right, I have one more announcement.

For too long now, some of you, identities unknown,

have taken it upon yourselves

to instigate various incidents.

A mockery has been made of teachers and traditions.

The perpetrators claim their actions do no harm.

Their intention is to...

\"awaken slumbering spirits through random acts of chaos.\"

But whoever you are, you listen closely.

This is not a warning. It is a fact.

Misbehavior and disorder will not

be tolerated at Tres Rios.

I will find out who you are,

and you will be punished.

Severely.

You will learn.

[computer beeping]

[distorted duck voice] No onemakes a fool out of this administration.

What's the matter?

[students laughing]

All right.

All right, okay, this is not funny.

Stop laughing, stop now!

Stop! [students laughing]

All right, can you hear me now?


Testing, can you hear me?

Can you hear me testing one, two? Okay.

All right, settle down.

Settle down.

Where was I? Oh yes, of course.

Nobody makes a fool out of this administration.

Believe me, I am in full control of the situation.

[button rolling down]

Better not push that button, Dean.

[sparks buzzing, explosion]

â™ª Bounce, bounce, bounce

â™ª Come on, bounce, bounce, bounce â™ª

â™ª It's like Scorsese, mixed with four leg... â™ª

â™ª Lost in the grill with a pitchfork, baby â™ª

â™ª Stand tall since we exit Broadville â™ª

â™ª Then rip the match like reflecting God's will â™ª

Stop this nonsense!

Stop it, now!

â™ª Celebrate the last place

â™ª Sounds like a panic attack [fire alarm beeping]

â™ª So the photo was dark when the camera was snapped â™ª

â™ª Flashback to Oliver, he was cracked like â™ª

â™ª Alexander is the new plan

â™ª Come over here with my brothers â™ª

â™ª Scar photos, rip these all, boy troll â™ª

â™ª Your swagger, you're playing from a scene â™ª

Pranksters.

[upbeat pop music]

Hey, do you know the Giants have a guy named Dick Hertz?

Check it out.

Nice.

[upbeat pop] [water splashing]

â™ª Looking like a girl, she's pretty â™ª

â™ª Listen to what's underneath

â™ª Living like a wild beast

â™ª She's so hot

â™ª She's so hot

Tiffany Fowler, legend in her own mind.

Those cannot be real.

Wouldn't you love to find out?

[record scratching]

Excuse me?

Let's face it.

Tiffany's got the hottest bod around.

No wonder she's the most popular chick in school.

Who is this person?

My cousin.

[theme music]

Her name is Sage.

Her family just moved here and they're staying at my house.

She saw us working on the voice filter.

Owl, that is a breach of security.

Sorry.

She won't snitch.

She thinks what we do is cool.

In fact, she wants to be a Prankster.

[Larry laughing]

She wants to be a Prankster?

Yeah.

We've never had a girl before.

Get serious.

The last thing we need is some amateur blowing our cover.

She used to go to some arts academy.

Maybe there's a way she can, you know, help.

Yeah, from the looks of her, she's no ordinary girl.

First thing you gotta realize is that being a Prankster

is not just about pulling jokes.

It's a state of mind.

A way of life.

I can dig that.

Look, any moron can pull a joke.

The Varsity Lettermen do all the time,

pantsing freshmen, giving guys wedgies, swirlies.

That stuff is reptilian.

Precisely.

It victimizes the innocent, and what's worse,

lacks imagination.

The whole point of being a Prankster

is to nail someone who really deserves it,

and to do it with panache.

Gentlemen, our motto.

Death to boredom and oppression.

Down with pretension and posers.

Up with laughter and chaos.

And never, ever suck up.


[prankster call]

Tres cool.


That's what people say about us.

I know, but she's really weird.

Who cares man?

We're gonna graduate soon.

So?

So maybe it's time to pass the torch.

Can't be Pranksters forever.

What else are we supposed to do?

I don't know.

There's gotta be more to life.

Ever think about what's next?

You mean working like dogs and being miserable

the rest of our lives?

Exactly. I try not to.

â™ª Impossibe, impossible

â™ª Impossible

â™ª Your love is something I cannot remember â™ª

In your dreams, pal.

[motorbike whirring]

[door knocking]

Have your order.

Dad! The burger guy's here!

Yes, son, how much?

$19.75 Dr. Burris.

Well, here's a 20.

Keep the change.

Thanks.

Say, aren't you in Bradley's class?

Yeah, dad.

He's Chris Karas. Oh.

The A student.

Seems you're the only other boy in school

with grades as good as Bradley's.

Well, I study a lot.

Bradley's grades could be better

if he wasn't student body president.

But you have to be more than a bookworm

to get into Yale, right Bradley?

Oh, yes sir.

I remember my school days.

Track club, Thespians.

Hamlet.

Neither a borrower nor a lender be.

And this above all, to thine own self be true.

And it must follow as the night the day.

Thou canst be false to any man.

Wow, how well you say those lines, Dr. Burris.

I've always had a flare for drama.

Well, I gotta go.

But hey, I have a favorite quote from Hamlet.

Really? Well, what's that, son?

Oh, thou pernicious knave.

How one may smile and smile, and be a villain.

[Greek folk music] [seagulls squawking]


Hey, don't like the music?

Change it.

I'll change it.

No, that's okay, uncle.

[motown music]

What's wrong?

You don't look so good.

It's nothing.

Nothing?

This nothing, she is a woman?

I can tell.

No Uncle Nick, I wish.

Your cousin Doris,

he can meet you some nice Greek girls.

No please, Uncle Nick.

[Nick laughing]

What?

Can I ask you something?

Can you ask your uncle something?

Anything, everything.

Ella. Come.

Do you ever get the feeling that there's something missing

in your life and you can't figure out what?

This world is a life sentence.

Zorba said that.

So now you feel like Zorba, heh?

Here, not so busy.

No.

Take this, go have some fun.

Relax, okay?

And don't forget, old Greek saying,

keep your eyes on the stars.

The clouds come and go, but the stars, they're always there.


[motorcycle whirring]

[TV Announcer] Keep the runner on his toes.

What are you doing home?

Got off early.

How are you going to make any money getting off early?

Uncle Nick paid me.

He paid you for not working.

His head is in the stars.

What if he gets into trouble?

Then who's going to help him?

How was my day? Simply marvelous.

Thanks for asking.

[gentle music]

Hey.

What up? Not much.

Did you happen to figure out that chemistry last night?

Thank you.

I don't remember a Hugh Mungus in this class.

Hugh?


[ball bouncing]

So jump. Right there.

Larry! Oh!


Hey, you wankers wanna play a game?

[tense rock chord]

Yeah, Fasco!

Why don't you see what you can do

against some real competition?

Our luck to have P.E.,

the one period the Dean teaches.

All right, Blotto.

What are the teams?

Heroes versus zeroes.

First to 11?

You got it.

All right, zeroes go skins.

[rock music] Where's your man? Got it!


I'm all open! Let's go!


Oh yeah! Oh!


It's all you, it's all gold!

Here you go, stop!


Oh! Oh!

[players yelling]


Oh! Oh!



Try it again, try it again, come on let's try it again.

[boys yelling]

Take out my man!

We've got to call help!

We're getting slammed.

I know.

Let's smoke these turkeys.

There.


[players yelling]

Hey, that was a foul!

He ran into a screen.

Part of the game.

[upbeat music]




Yeah! Oh!


I got him, I got him, I got him.


Bring it! Come on, Larry!



That's how you play basketball, baby.



Where are you going?

Yeah!


Let's go, baby! That's right, that's right.


Let's go!

10-10.

Our ball, next basket wins.


Dude, let's do it! I got him, I got him!

[ball banging]



Yeah!

11-10!

We win chumps! Let's go!

And the crowd goes wild!

Up yours, pizza face.

Hey, what's your problem, man?

I don't have a problem, what's your problem?

Oh, you gonna cry now because you lost?

You are such a woman, Fasco.

A woman?

You're the one with boobs.

What'd you say?

You got a problem with me, man? You wanna go?

All right, all right, break it up!

You know, Fasco, if you took half that intensity

and put it into learning the game, you might be a player.

But you don't have it in you.

What do you mean?

I mean that at first I was disappointed

that you didn't try out for the team, but now I'm glad,

'cause everything you do is half-assed.

You're not a winner.

What, you got something to say?

Go ahead.

Make my day.

Oh!

Boo hoo!

All right, all right, all right.

Take a lap!

Let's go.

Run!

Larry, wait up.

Don't worry about it, man, okay?

He's an asshole.

No, we had them in that game.

All I had to do was hit my shot and we could have won.

It was my bread and butter and I fricking choked it.

I could have won, man.

So what? It doesn't matter.

Well, it matters to me.

Maybe Pecarino's right.

Maybe I am a loser.

Hey.

Don't let him get to you, okay?

Remember what you always told me?

What?

Don't get mad.

Wreak havoc.

[TV Announcer] They got something going there,

now the crowd is wild.

It's the bottom of the eighth inning,

and so far it's been a very tough game.

Western.

[TV Announcer] He's got the runner on-

Dad, What did you do with my letter?

Stupid team.

They were up by five, now only by one.

When were you going to tell me you applied?

I'm always the last to know.

Well, they accepted you.

Now, how are you going to pay for this Western University?

But you said if I got good grades, I-

I said if you got good grades,

you could go to Junior College.

That way you could live at home and work with me.

But Junior College isn't the same as Western.

Why? You too good for JC?

You know, I had to work. I didn't go to college.

I'm not going to JC.

Fine.

If you want to go to some fancy school,

when there's a perfectly good one right here that's free,

you pay for it.

[TV Announcer] The crowd is loving it.

But dad, how am I supposed to pay for Western by myself?

You should've thought of that before you applied.

You're dreaming like your uncle.

Okay, if you need money, you need to get a real job.

I have work this weekend. I need a man.

[tools buzzing]

[Truck beeping]

[men laughing]

[car whirring]

How's the working class hero?

[dramatic French music]

And so, Monsieur Sartre wishes to say

that we live in an absurd and meaningless cosmos.

A time when there is no longer any certainty

about what is right or how to be.

In the end, we must conclude as Garcin does in \"Huis Clos,\"

that hell is other people.

I always feel so good after French class.

Me too.

I think I'll kill myself.

[people chattering]

What are you doing?

Jeez. Was just checking out this BS.

Outstanding Teenagers of America?

You gotta be one primo-suck up to go for that.

Aloha.

Listen, if you want to be a Prankster,

you got to look inconspicuous.

Roger.

So what up?

All great heroes have a base of operations.

Batman has the Batcave.

Superman has the Fortress of Solitude.

We have Kokopelli's Lair.

Kokopelli? Kokopelli.

Native American God of mischief, AKA, trickster.



I give you

the Lair.

Guys, this is the AV department.

Yeah, audio visual.

Infamous bastion of the super geek.

And the last place any self-respecting prep,

jock or even teacher would ever be caught.


Whoa! [upbeat music]

Two way mirror.

God, there's enough stuff in here

to rewire the space shuttle.

A Prankster must always be prepared for all occasions.

Check out what I snatched from the office

while the secretary was in the loo.

\"From the desk of Joe Pecarino.\"

Awesome.

Not to mention the combination of the announcement board

and the access codes to the PA system.

All right. Nice!

Get 'em! Woo-woo-woo!

Enough backdrop.

Fearless leader, our agenda?

Time for Operation Payback.

[upbeat music]

[girls laughing]

Uh-oh, be cool.

Baseball cards?

How old are you, Larry? Eight and a half?

â™ª Is it just another dream?

Old enough to get you in trouble.

Trade you A-Rod for Madonna or whatever.

â™ª Looking like a girl, she's pretty â™ª

Do you know him?

Larry Fasco was my first boyfriend in fifth grade.

He was kinda cute then.

And he still is, except for he hangs out

with a bunch of dorks!

They don't seem that bad.

Mariah.

I did not get to where I am by wasting my time on nobodies.

I just didn't.

â™ª She knows the world is hers until she says it's not. â™ª

Come on, come on, let's go.

You're on my time. Let's go.

Come on, come on.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[sneaky music]

-All right, settle. -That's Blotto's seat.

The simulators work on a simple principle.

Reverse the polarity and every response

will be read as its opposite.

Good. Owl?

An extra hard drive is already hooked up to the system.

Excellent. How'd it turn out?

Lucky for us, my dad's a video editor.

Wait until you see the sick effects I put in.

Anyone wanna tell me what's going on here?

Watch and learn.

Is that the one you wired, Vish?

Yeah.

Isn't he a tad old for this?

Blotto was clocked doing 70 on Mission.

Got his license taken away.

Now he's got to take driver's ed again to get it back.

Just so happens he's taking his final today.

Wonder if he'll pass?

The test is comprised of situations

you've practiced extensively.

There are 40 points altogether.

You need to keep your mistakes to five or fewer.

Good luck.

Well, looks like everybody did just fine.

Except Mr. Wojonowski.

What?

Your results show you missed 39 out of 40.

There's no way! [students laughing]

Hey shut up, punks!

All right, all right, settle.

Look, you're excused to take your street exam.

Come on, go, go, go.

Except Mr. Wojonowski.

Okay Owl, time to step up.

You know I'm not surprised.

From the beginning you've regarded this class as a big joke.

But I couldn't have missed that many, Mr. Bohr.

There's gotta be something wrong with the machine.

[Mr. Bohr laughing]

The simulator doesn't lie.

But I have to admit, 39 out of 40?

I'll tell you what I'll do.

I'll let you retake the test.

Yes. But this time

you're gonna have to make a perfect score.

You're on.

[car engine roaring]


[Frantic Music]

[boy screaming]

[dinosaur roaring]

[explosions crashing]

[alien laughing]

Mr. Bohr! Mr. Bohr!

[explosion crashing]

Poetry in pranks, there's no other way to describe it.

How do you top that?

Well, there's still the Dean, not to mention Tiffany.

How's your handwriting?

Perfect. Time for Operation Clueless.

[Sage laughing]

Good morning, Dean.

Here's your mail.

Thank you, Judy.


as to call you Joseph?

I wouldn't blame you if you burned this letter.

That would be the prudent thing to do.

I would not have thought it possible,

but the power of l'amour

has conquered my heart.

[door knocking]

Oui.


I must say it.

Although if you dare to confront me with what I've written,

I will be forced to disavow it as a childish prank.

I adore you beyond all reason, beyond all hope,

beyond all despair.

We shall not cease from exploration,

and the end of all our exploring

will be to arrive where we started,

and know the place for the first time.

T. S. Eliot.

What do you suppose he meant by that?

Tiffany?

Sounds like the guy should have never left home.

You're trying to be funny, but in a way you're right.

Chris.

I don't know.

It seems like he means we try all this stuff

to figure out who we are,

but in the end none of it really matters.

We just are.

[keyboard tapping]

Who in the world is pulling these grotesque pranks?

When I find out, I'm gonna kick their ass.

Oh my God, I forgot to update the yearbook

photo schedule in the paper.

Meet you at the bleachers?

[keyboard tapping]

Tiffany is gonna die when she sees this.

Oh Mariah, hi.

I was just looking for Ms. Bell. Is she here?

No? Okay I'll just try back later.

How did you get in?

Me?

The door was unlocked.

No it wasn't.

You were already here.

I never woulda guessed.

What?

Well, this is great,

but I would have ended it differently.

Really?

I mean, what do you mean?

Relax.

The articles you've been sneaking in

are the best thing about this stupid paper.

You think so?

For sure.

If this were to get out-

I won't tell.

I promise.

â™ª Impossible

Okay. â™ª Impossible

Well if you don't mind, I got to be going.

Okay. It was nice talking to you.

Yeah.

â™ª Impossible

What's wrong with the ending?

[jazz music]

That's a great ensemble.

Hey, I mean it.

Those shades are fresh.

Yeah?

Do they make me look inconspicuous?

I don't think that's the word I would use to describe you.

Yeah, most people think I'm pretty bizarre.

I didn't say that.

It takes guts to be different.

You like jazz?

Miles, Coltrane.

No shit! You're into that spacey stuff?

What about poetry?

I don't know.

You want to hear a poem?

Sure.

Well, it's not finished or anything, so.

Wait, you wrote this?


Exemplary.

Moloch Trashes Suburbia,

Low on the horizon in the air conditioned nightmare

of slumbering half lives, a secret horror lurks.

Hail Moloch, whose polyester mutant claws

engulf the city in an embrace that defines

the emptiness they call joy.

[hands clapping]

It's a little melancholy, but I liked it.

For real.

I'm not just a jock.

Oh Pookie. I'm so happy.

So am I.

Today's the big day.

It is?

The preliminary meeting of applicants

for the Outstanding Teenagers of America Scholarship.

If I win, I'll get into Yale for sure.

Yale? Yes.

Doesn't it give you the goosebumps?

Oh yes, of course.

But Bradley-kins, if you go to Yale,

then and how will we be together?

Well, I'll write every week, of course.

Okay.

And most likely I'll be home for Christmas.

Unless I get invited to go skiing

with my fraternity brothers.

But don't worry about that now.

Okay.

It's time.

Oh, oh.

Wait, wait, Bradley!

There's this really amazing article of me

in this week's paper.

Shut up!

A whole article just about you?

Well, that's what happens

when you're naturally charismatic.

Okay, let's read it.

Tiffany Fowler, our very own teen sex goddess

has skillfully exploited her bountiful bustline

to reach the very pinnacle of Tres Rio society.

Yet, the gravity defying perkiness

of her infamous casabas gives us cause for suspicion.

Is that killer rack legit?

Go to AreTiffanysReal.com to find out.

[Tiffany screaming]

[loud rock chord]

[romantic French music]

Oh! Excuse me.

Excusez-moi

We have to talk.

I read what you wrote.

What I wrote?

Yes.

Oh. Oh, I get it.

You're right.

This isn't the time or place.

Ah, say no more.

Comme dit Pascal,

The heart has reasons that reason does not know.

Right.

The Outstanding Teenagers of America Scholarship.

To be chosen, you must stand out from the crowd.

[mic feedback wailing]

Yeah, I think we can do without this.

Where was I?

You were explaining about the scholarship, sir.

Yes. Of course, thank you.

Thank you, Brad.

How is the award decided?

Well, first your records are reviewed by myself

and the selection committee.

Goes without saying, any disciplinary problems

will give you a serious black eye.

Your grades are important,

but just as important are the extracurriculars.

Athletics, club memberships, offices held.

And I should add that we still have spring elections

and tryouts for graduation speaker,

either of which would be a substantial feather in your cap.

The winner will be announced at graduation.

Good luck.

Dean.

I presume you'll take into account some applicants

are planning to attend prestigious universities,

like Yale, for example.

Ah yes. That's, that's a legitimate point, Dr. Burris.

Have Brad mention that on his application.

What a suck up.

Whoa!

Lettermen of the Week!


Letterwoman?

That's kinda hot.

What you doing, money?

Oh, oh, oh, what's up, money?

I was just getting ready for some ball, baby!

[upbeat music]

And so my fellow graduates, I think I speak for all of us

when I say tonight we graduate.

God, that's so feeble.

Hey. No temperature.

In mines, men start talking to self

just before go. [whistling]

Oh no, I'm okay, Uncle Nick.

I was practicing for a speech.

A speech?

You're going to be a speaker like Socrates?

I doubt it.

I just thought I'd try out for graduation.

Graduation.

Fantastic!

We'll invite all the cousins.

No, no, I'm just trying out.

Probably won't get it.

What do you mean?

You speak wonderful English.

Well, yes, but there are other kids trying out.

Experienced speakers.

If they not choose you, it is fixed.

Let me tell you.


Oh no.

What's the matter?

It's the girl you like?

Very nice. Fantastic chest.

No, not her.

Hello? Is anybody home?

Ah, the pretty one with dark hair?

Yes.

I mean no.

God, what am I saying?

I like her.

Oh, the two of you will make beautiful babies.


Okay.

Go, go.


[machine beeping]

Yeah, take your order.

Anyways. He was like, \"I called you last night.\"

And I was like, \"No you didn't.

My phone doesn't show when people don't call.

And he was like, \"Yeah, I did.\"

If it isn't Larry's little play pal.

Can we pay for this with baseball cards?

It depends on the cards.

Your order is...

Yeah, it'll be right up.

Do you know him?

Sure. He's Chris Karas.

He's in our English class?

Duh.

He seems like a nice guy.

Yeah, well, for a nobody you mean?

I mean he seems nice, period.

Well, I'm sure that Eric would find that very interesting.

Okay, we have two Plato Burgers,

one Homeric hot dog with cheese, a strawberry shake,

three cherry colas.

Do you mind if I ask you something?

What?

We were all just wondering if this whole refugee look

you've got going on is something that you do on purpose?

Tiffany, you're so rude.

What are you doing? I was joking!


Okay. I was joke... I'm sorry!

Sorry, I'm sorry!

I'm sorry. Can we go now?

You guys can go, but I don't feel like coming with.

Fine, have it your way.

But if you ask me, you've been acting really whack lately!

[upbeat jazz music]

Play that funky music, white boy!

Hey, what's up?

That sax is dope.

Yeah. Do you play?

No, but I'd like to.

So why don't you?

My father would freak.

It's not part of the program.

See lucky for me, my mom's an ex-hippie.

Check this out.

What do you think?

Vintage.

[Sage laughing]

Come on.

[uplifting Greek music]

Don't just stand there.

Go ask her if she wants something.

Hey, no charge.

Time to step up, dude.

Excuse me?

No, I was just saying that Tiffany has got some attitude.

For sure.

She's been all whiny ever since that article came out.

For the lady and the gentleman.

Thank you.

Oh Mariah, this is my Uncle Nick.

Uncle Nick, this is Mariah Rivera.

It's nice to meet you.

Oh, the pleasure is all mine young lady.

Any friend of my nephew is most welcome here.

Sorry, my Uncle Nick is from the old country.

Really?

What's the old country?

Greece.

Are you from there?

No, I was born here.

Me too.

I'm sorry, excuse me.

How's it going?

Fine I guess?

I don't know.

Okay, take the car.

Where? Where? Anywhere.

Have a good time.

I can't do that, Uncle Nick.

Why not?

Because she's way out of my league.

Besides, she's got a boyfriend.

I'm not asking you to marry her.

Just go for a ride.

Throw the dice, see what happen.

But- There's no but.

In this brief life,

you have to dance like nobody's watching

and to love like there's no tomorrow.

Understand?

Go.

[seagulls squawking]

Can I give you a ride somewhere?

[cool jazz music]

It's pretty cool.

Come here often?

Yeah, to thaw.

You know, get that rah, rah, merit, demerit

crapola out of my brain.

Unagi sandwich?

No thanks.

You're different!

I'm not trying to be.

Can I tell you something?

Sure.

I never wanted to be quarterback.

I just did it because both my brothers did.

Well, the costumes are cute and I hear you're pretty good.

Well, you play a role long enough,

sometimes it plays you.

That's deep. Real deep.

[Sage laughing]

Sometimes I just wish I could resign from being Eric Hood.

Just chuck the whole thing and start over.

Why don't you?

Is that allowed?

[playful music]

Nice ride.

Think so?

Yeah.

Just because Eric's dad is a Mercedes dealer

doesn't mean I'm a snob about cars.

My Uncle Nick says he's gonna give me this beauty

when I go to college.

Oh yeah?

Where are you going?

Western.

For sure?

Yeah. Me too.

They're giving me a full scholarship there.

Wow.

How'd you snag that?

They had some reserved for Hispanic students,

although my parents could have paid for it.

Maybe we'll have some classes together.

Yeah. Maybe.

[upbeat music]

That place is so out of it.

Not only did they give out fortune cookies,

they're not even normal ones.

Listen to this.

The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.

Don't go back to sleep.

What?

I just can't get over it.

That picture of me is so old.

I gave them so many cuter ones.

I know.


Blotto and the Lettermen are going to dress up

in drag for the Senior Follies!

Oh, can you imagine Blotto in a dress?

Ew.

Hey, isn't that Mariah?

What is she doing with a non-entity like Chris Karas?

If Eric found out she'd be history.

Think so?

I always thought Eric and Mariah were, well, mismatched.

Let's follow them.

Watch it, you little dwarf!

You almost spilled on my Louis.

Sorry.

You're Tiffany Fowler, right?

Wow.

I just wanted to say, if I were your guy,

wouldn't matter to me whether they were real or not.

[upbeat cumbia music]

Why are you going this way?

I'm just afraid some kids from school might see us.

Are you ashamed to be seen with me?

Are you kidding?

Just the opposite.

I just don't want people to get the wrong idea or anything.

Which is?

Okay, this may sound presumptuous,

not to mention totally preposterous,

but they might think I was trying

to pick up on you or something.

I don't care.

But what about Eric?

I mean that guy is like all everything, he'd thrash me.

For giving me a ride?

Even if you were trying to pick up on me,

he probably wouldn't even care.

Why?

Have you ever had that feeling

something's missing in your life,

but you just can't figure out what?

[car engine]

Wow.

Nice abode.

Thanks.

Sweet landscaping, who does it?

My father, it's his hobby.

Listen, I better go.

Thanks for the ride.

Sure. Any time.

I just wanted to tell you, it wouldn't be preposterous.

What?

Hey, Chica!

Daddy? You're home early.

Yeah.

Como te va?

I'm fine daddy.

Do you mind speaking English?

No es problema. Entiendo espanol muy bien.

Hey, that's pretty good.

You have a lovely home, Mr. Rivera.

Oh this?

En mis suenos, chico.

Our little casita's in the back.

Later mija.

Y tu Mama's waiting for you to help her

in the big house, eh?

Mucho gusto.

Shoot me now.

What?

Come on.

You have nothing to be ashamed of.

Right.

Listen Mariah, I like you for who you are.

[gentle music]

No wonder she's never had us over.

It's so sad.

Just because I'm substituting,

don't think you can put anything over on me.

Someone is cutting class, and I'm going to find out who.

Yurkoff Ivanna.

Ivanna Yurkoff?

Wang Long?

Long Wang?

Hertz, Dick.

Dick Hertz.

Oh come on now, who's Dick Hertz?

[students laughing]

Yes Dean, I'll do my best, sir.

You know you can count on me.

That's enough, Burris.

Send in the next applicant.

Chris, I didn't know you applied.

So you have, sit down.

I've been calling in the various scholarship applicants

to review the committee's preliminary evaluations.

We have no problems with you scholastically, Chris,

but when it comes to extracurriculars-

Yes Dean, I know I haven't done much,

but I am trying out for graduation speaker.

Good. That would help a lot.

In fact, it could make you the front runner, if you get it.

But failing that, there is something else you could do.

What's that?

Do you know anything about a group called The Pranksters?

I know what they do, but nobody knows who they are.

Well, I would very much like to know who they are.

If you see or hear anything, anything at all,

it could bode well for your application.

[door creaking]

Well, well, well, if it isn't the missing stink.

Where you been?

Had to study. What's up?

What's up?

I don't know, just the Spring Follies,

The event we've been dreaming about trashing all year.

We're gonna fill these bad boys up,

drop 'em from the rafters,

and it's gonna be disco madness.

Blotto will be wearing the adornments of a fine lady.

And the Dean will be chaperoning with Ms. LaFleur.

[laughing, hooting]

Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

Guys, if we get caught, we can get in a lot of trouble.

Uh, and if it rains, the ground might get wet.

What's that got to do with anything?

Nothing, it's just that we're graduating soon.

What I mean is, maybe we should quit while we're ahead.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, time out, man.

Am I hearing you correctly?

You want to fold up and get out while the getting is good?

For the sake of our future.

No, for the sake of your future.

I'm not going to college.

That's awesome, Larry. But I am.

That's what this is about, isn't it?

I thought we were partners.

Yeah we are, but I can't-

But, but what? Huh?

I'm not backing out.

I'm sticking with the plan

whether you guys are with me or not.

Larry! Screw you, man.

Well, if it isn't cry baby Larry Fiasco.

What's wrong?

Did your mom stop breastfeeding you this morning?

Hey Blotto?

If it weren't Be Kind to Imbeciles week, I'd kick your ass.

I'd like to see you try.

I love how you walk around school

like you're so smart and everything,

and yet your name is never on the honor roll.

Hey Blotto, sit on this.

Now see, that's what you shouldn't have done.

[upbeat music]

Swirlie!

No, no, no, no, wait!

No, no, no, no, no, no!

[students yelling]



Fade out, defects!


No!

God, no!


Don't be afraid of the water!



No, no, no!

Oh! Oh you like?


Yo, yo! Go, go, go!

Dean, Dean, you got to do something.

The Lettermen just gave Larry a swirlie.

So you claim.

Come on, Dean!

What'd you do to provoke them?

You're okay, a little water never hurt anyone.

Clean up that mess!

We're gonna get them for this.

Big time.

[Greek music]

Well, I dunno if this guy is bullshitting me or what?

So I lowered the offer on the truck.

So he looks at me with this big tomato face

and he says, \"Okay, I'll take it.\"

[family laughing]

Everyone knows you're the Onassis in this family.

Everybody, a toast.

A toast to Stavros Onassis.

Yasou, yasou!

Hey, where are you going?

Out.

Out? Out where?

There's this thing at school tonight.

A thing? What kind of thing?

Well, if you must know, it's called the Spring Follies.

I'm going with the guys.

The guys, the guys, you're always with the guys.

What, I have to worry you're turning

into one of those, how you say, fruit vendors?


Give me a break, dad.

Hey boss.

Your father, he means well.

He just not know what to say.

Out of 10 things he tell you, take maybe two or three.

Forget the rest.

That's an interesting way of looking at it.

He's a wonderful kid.

Yeah, yeah.

You know what he needs.

He needs to get real.

Stavros, you're my brother and I love you,

but you would clip the wings of an angel

to keep him from flying.

You and your pie in the sky ideas.

I don't want him to get disappointed.

What are you afraid of?

His mother died when he was only five.

I have to protect him or I'm not a good father.

Ah, Eleni, she was so beautiful.

If only she could see him now.

Maybe she can.

Maybe she can.

You want to be good father?

Tell him you're proud of him.

Proud? For what?

For anything, everything. It doesn't matter.

Just tell him.

[crowd chattering]

Bradley-kins?

Don't you think that working with the Dean

to entrap the Pranksters is a little bit squirrely?

Pookie, you have no idea of the pressure I'm under.

Wow, I can't believe you fit into this.

I can't believe how many people believed that article.

Maybe I should make an announcement.

Like, \"My boobs are real, thank you.\"

Thank you.

So one of the really fun things you get to do

at the Spring Follies is announce the senior superlatives!

It is my honor to announce the senior couple.

Assistant, the envelope please.

[paper rustling]

What a surprise, Eric Hood and Mariah Rivera.

[crowd applauding]

Don't just stand there, Eric, give her a smooch!

[crowd cheering]


Makes me want to hurl.

Check it out. 500 balloons.

So what's in 'em? Water.

Plus a special slime additive.

Makes all the difference.

Hoo-ah!

It's show time.


voted most likely to succeed.

Please welcome the syncopated perambulations

of Brad Burris and Pookie Longmeyer.

[upbeat Broadway music]

This is pretty weird, huh?

If you guys didn't know I was a dude,

would you think I was sexy?

[Broadway music]

[audience clapping]

Thank you, hey.

Thanks very much.

They say Spring is a time of transformation.

It is my pleasure to give to you

the Song Girls and the Lettermen

as you've never seen them before.

Take it away, maestro!

[students laughing] [hip hop music]

â™ª Let's do!

â™ª Let's get this party started right â™ª

â™ª All right

â™ª Let's get this party started

â™ª All right

â™ª Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go â™ª

Dean, may I ask you a question?

Fire away.

Do you think what Emma Bovary did was wrong?

Is she a senior?

She's a character in French literature.

Oh, of course.

And she left a very lifeless marriage

to have a very passionate affair.

â™ª Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

â™ª Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

â™ª Here we go, here we go

â™ª Here we go, let's go ya'll

â™ª Here we go, here we go, here we go â™ª

â™ª Let's go, y'all

â™ª Let's go, let's ride

â™ª Let's go, let's ride

â™ª Let's go, let's ride

â™ª Let's go

[electric buzzing]

[disco music]

[students laughing]

Joseph, do you know how long

I've waited for this moment?

Oh no, no, not here, not here!

Why? Why not?

Oh, I've seen the rehearsal.

No, we're safe, we're safe, we're safe.

No one will see us.

But still.

Oh Joseph, please!

Come on, I like a little danger, you know?

Yes, it really turns me on.

Let's live a little dangerously.

[Joseph groaning]

Oh yeah! Oh yes!

Come on you big bad wolf!

â™ª My eyes move a little

â™ª And I wanna solve it

All right, you guys ready?

Time for Operation Slime!

Let's do it.

Look out, here comes Burris!

Shoot.

[Sound pop]

Sorry for the technical difficulties, everybody.

We'll have everything back to normal in a jiffy.

Dammit, we didn't get to drop the balloons.

That was gonna be the best part.


I can't take it any more!


Oh! Oh!


Oh! Is that who I think it is?

Sounds like it.

Yeah, oh! If it is,

they are right behind the curtain.

Do you know how to work it?

I'm not sure.

Yeah, oh!

Joseph, I'm like floating on a boat in a storm.


Yes, take me!

I can't believe this, where's the Dean?


Oh, I could devour you!

[Dean yelling]

[students yelling]

Don't worry folks!

Everything's under control.

Close the curtain!

[slime splashing]

[students cheering]


Well, a little bit of slime never hurt anybody.

[Prankster Call]

[tense music]

Believe me, I have had it up to here

with this Prankster garbage.

Let me kick their ass, Dean.

We have to know who they are first, Blotto.

Oh, stupid.

Brad here has come up with a brilliant plan.

The Dean's gonna videotape an announcement

to play on the school's closed circuit system.

Our job is to leak this information.

Why?

My father's security consultant

planted a microchip in this tape.

Since the Pranksters love to sabotage the Dean's speeches,

they'll steal it, and then we track the chip, and bingo!

I'll kill 'em!

Well, are you sure this will work?

I mean, they're not stupid.

Oh!

Oh, it'll work.

It's too juicy for them to resist.


Here we go, everyone smile.

Oh, that's great.

What club is this? Medical careers.

That's me, all right.

Motivational psychologist.

Ear, nose and throat.

Gynecology.

My friends tell me there are many openings in this field.

You believed this? My God.


Well, it looks like your handwriting.

Am I really that melodramatic?

Thank goodness the superintendent

has given us a second chance.

Why are these kids doing this to us?

Oh I know it's embarrassing, Joe,

but try not to take it so personally.

What?

Well, I just... [laughing]

I just think these pranks are just youthful acts

of self expression,

and they're pretty creative ones at that.

Whose side are you on, Madeline?

This isn't creativity.

It's insubordination and it must be stopped.

Let's roll tape.

Oh, all right.

Three and, okay.

Good afternoon.

A clear and present danger has been posed

to the security of this administration.

I promise you that as long as Joe Pecarino is your Dean,

the forces of disorder and chaos

will never triumph at Tres Rios High.

Cut. How was that?

It's a bit strident.

Really?

Well just try it again,

only this time take it down a notch.

Pretend you're at my place.

Okay.

Oh zoot, we're out of tape.

Oh that's okay. I can get another one.

I'm just gonna go to the little girl's room.

Freshen up.


[alarm beeping]

Yeah?

Oh yeah, baby.

Yeah, you the man. No, you the man.

No, you the main man.

Say hello to my little friend.

You the man.

You know what you are?

You the babe.

You the hot babe.

Yeah.

Bad knee, could have played pro ball.

You look good. You look real good.

They call me Big Joe.

You wanna meet Little Joe?

You love me?

I love you too, baby

Yeah baby.

What?

You wanna see me naked?

I wanna see you naked.

[lusty growl]

[pensive music]

Hey boss.


What do you think of this one?

I am caught in this curling energy, your hair.

Whoever is calm and sensible,

is insane.

It's different.

It's Rumi. Great Sufi poet.

Something bothering you?

Okay.

So graduation speaker tryouts are tomorrow.

Now, I've been practicing my speech all day,

but I don't know if it's any good.

The point is, if I lose the competition,

I won't get the scholarship I need to go to college,

and my life will be ruined permanently.

Oh, poor boy.

No worry so much.

I'm sure your speech is fantastic.

No, Uncle Nick, it sucks.

You know old Greek story of eagle and chickens?

No?

All right, listen.

One time there was a baby eagle. Lived with chickens.

Not know he was eagle.

He grew up in yard acting like chicken,

thinking he chicken.

One day, fantastic bird pass in the sky.

Fly so beautiful.

\"What kind of bird is that?\" ask little eagle.

Other chicken say, \"Oh, that's eagle.

\"We can never be like this.\"

So that little eagle spent whole life in yard

thinking he only chicken.

Sad, eh?

Yeah.

Chris, my nephew.

Don't live life like chicken in yard.

Okay.

We've narrowed it down to two of you

whom we'd like to hear again.

Brad Burris and Chris Karas.

But most of all, I thank my wonderful teachers

for their invaluable help along the way,

and Dean Pecarino,

the best Dean this school has ever had.

Thank you.

And so we venture forth into the world,

taking with us the fond memories and invaluable lessons

that we've been fortunate enough

to learn here at Tres Rios.

Thank you.

I want you both to know

this was a very difficult decision.

The committee feels both of you were excellent,

but unfortunately we can only choose one.

Chris Karas.


What did I tell you?

You are eagle!

So you have scholarship?

No, not yet, but I will be speaking at graduation,

and that should help a lot.

Okay.

We'll have some ouzo.

A toast to the eagles!

Okay.

Yasou.

[gentle music]

Hey.

Where were you this morning?

Figured an ace suck up like you

was probably getting a ride from one of his teachers.

Maybe the Dean himself.

What are you talking about?

Morning Bulletin.

Hearty congratulations to senior Chris Karas,

winner of graduation speaker tryouts.

We know Chris will be a great representative

for our class and school.

Look, Larry, I was gonna tell you.

Guess it doesn't help to explain.

Some things in life aren't explainable, Chris.

This is one of them.

How could you do this?

I needed to, okay?

For the scholarship.

Scholarship?

Outstanding Teenagers of America?

Oh!

This is too good.

Wow, when you decide to suck up, you go all the way.

Outstanding Teenagers of America?

That is the biggest suck-up award there is.

I had no choice.

Bullshit you had a choice,

and you decided to stab your friends in the back.

What did you expect from me?

What, to play pranks the rest of my life,

skip college and become homeless?

Or worse yet, work for my father?

We all have our problems, Chris.

It's the way you decided to handle things.

Yeah, well what way would you have approved of?

Look, I don't know Larry.

Maybe we should cut Chris some slack.

No, he sucked up big time,

and a Prankster never sucks up.

Come on guys, let's nab that tape.

Listen, be careful, okay.

There's something weird about the Dean's speech.

You're out of the loop, pal.

How about you? You coming or not?

I don't think so.

You guys aren't so much fun anymore.

[student laughing]

Well, if it isn't Larry's little play pal.

Looks like you've been playing with more

than just baseball cards.

What are you talking about?

What she means, bed wetter,

is that you've been messing with a Letterman's squeeze.

What's going on?

We were just talking to your new friend.

Does Eric know that you've been cruising with him?

He was just giving me a ride home.

Oh well that's not what I hear.

You don't know jack, Tiffany.

Excuse me, I think that Eric is the one

who doesn't know what's going on.

I bet he doesn't even know that you work as a house cleaner.


You're whack.

Yo man, this little wimp's been messing with your woman.

I think you ought to dust him.

Hit him. Get him.


Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

Pecarino's coming!

Behind the gym after school.

Behind the gym!

Why didn't you just tell me?

I was afraid you might not like me if you knew.

That's silly.

What about this thing with Chris?

We're just friends.

I believe you.

Then you won't fight?

If I backed down, what would people think?

That you have a mind of your own?

Isn't it amazing that adolescent boys

still engage in primitive rituals,

like maiming each other behind the gym?

I find it more amazing that I'm the prospective maimee.

Why don't you do something radical?

Like hand him a flower.

Or roll over on your back, like a dog.

Just trying to help.

[tense music]

You ready?

Yeah.

Hey.

Yeah. Listen, do me a favor.

Just keep everyone away, okay.

This could get ugly.

All right, bro.

All right, everybody back up.

Come on guys, get back.

You don't want to see this.

Come on.

[tense music]

[students chattering]

This is bogus.

Works for me. What about them?

Can you fake it?

Can I fake it?

Can the Dalai Lama meditate?

Let's go.

Ready?



Okay, let's not get carried away.

Well, you don't want them to think we're lightweights.


No, wait.




Now who do you suppose should win this thing?

Right.

Forgot, I'm the wuss.

All right, let's wrap this up.

Ketchup?

You didn't really think I was gonna kick your ass, did you?


No more, I give.

[students moaning]

Learn from that, dude.

How could you?

I was beginning to think maybe you were cool.

My mistake.

Hey wait.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I think so.

Maybe it's not such a good idea for you to be seen with me.

Doesn't matter.

Ever since Tiffany found out about my family,

I've become an outcast.

Yeah, that makes two of us.

Hey! Stop!

It's not what you think.

Really? What was it?

A love fest?

We didn't want to fight, so we faked it.

If you don't believe me, go ask Chris!

I swear it's true.

No, no, no, no, no worries, it's deactivated.

We can reactivate it at will.

So check this out.

Say hello to my little friend.

You the man.

You know what you are?

You the babe.

Hot babe.

You the big man, you're the hot babe.


Chris was right.

Too bad he isn't here to see this.

Yeah, we owe him one.

Where is he anyway?

Probably sucking up as we speak.

[crowd applauding] [music]

There's a little speech from Shakespeare

that I like to quote to young people.

Neither a borrower nor a lender be.

And this above all, to thine own self be true.

And it must follow, as the night the day,

thou canst be false to any man.


Hey boss.

Okay.

Awesome Abs, Maximum Muscle.

Hey Murray!

How much for this Ladies Fashion?

Oh, that's a that's for my girlfriend actually.

Yeah.

[playful theme music]

[birds chirping]

You sure there's nobody named Dick Hertz?

Yeah, I checked last year's yearbook.

Owl, you take care of that nominating petition?

Yep. Forged all 30 signatures

Oh my God.

Better watch it, that could have been the Dean.

Hold me. Hold me.

You think your man has a chance?

Hey, Hertz Dick grow beloved among the people,

even though he's without actually being.

It is their will that he become raj among the students.

Shocking. I'm shocked I say.

A non-existent student

winning student body president.

One of your best ideas, Chris.

Too bad you decided to become a suck up.

You guys look like you're doing just fine without me.

[dramatic music]

Is there, or is there not a Hugh Mungus in this classroom?

Hugh?

Who is this Dick Hertz character anyway?

What do you care?

You're headed off for Yale.

Don't take it so hard, Pooky-kins.

It'll all work out for the best.

Easy for you to say!

With me away, it'll be impossible to keep on.

Besides, I've been thinking.

No offense intended, but what will people think

if I told them I was going out with someone

attending a state college?

I don't believe you!

You know what I don't believe?

That this Hertz fellow is about to win my office,

and I haven't even met him.

Larry Fasco was putting up posters for him.

Fasco?

[tense music]

Hold it right there, mister.

What's the matter, Fasco, got something to hide?

What is this place?

Well, well.

Here's a familiar sight.

Huh, could it be coincidence?

I think not.

Dick Hertz.

You like Dick, do you?

Yep.

Anything wrong with that?

Well, there wouldn't be.

Except there is no Dick Hertz!

Really?

Wow.

I should have known you were behind

all this Prankster crap.

If you know what's good for you,

you'll tell me who else is involved.

All right, Dean, look, you win.

It was your mom.

[Alarm beeping]

The tape! Someone's taken it!

I'll deal with you later.

This way!



This can't be right.

Out of the way.

But Dean, this is my locker.

I knew it!

You've been leading me on all along, haven't you?

You smarmy little weasel!

No Dean, please!


[PA Announcer] Good afternoon.

A clear and present danger has been posed

at the security of this administration.

I promise you that as long as Joe Pecarino is your Dean.

Oh settle down there, Big Boy.

S'all right? S'all right!

You the man. No, you the man.

Well, you the main man.

Oh my God.


Looking good! [laughing]

Say hello to my little friend!

Check it out!

The Dean is talking to his dick.

As outgoing director of social affairs,

it is my privilege to announce the results

from the spring elections.

For vice president, Kassandra Yamaguchi!

Yay!

Thanks Tiff, I just wanna say that I'm so excited.

No.

And for president, Dick Hertz.

All right!

Yeah!

[students laughing]

Who's Dick Hertz!

I just wanted to say that, wow.

I'm totally blown away.

A freshman transfer elected student body president.

And I thought nobody knew I existed.

What do you think you're doing?

Making my acceptance speech.

Speech? Who are you?

I'm Dick Hertz.

Yeah, and I'm Itchy Balls.

Get out of here.

No really, look.

[students chattering]

The Dick Hertz who was elected doesn't exist.

But I exist.

â™ª Dickie, Dickie, Dickie, Dickie â™ª

â™ª Dickie, Dickie, Dickie, Dickie â™ª

â™ª Dickie, Dickie, Dickie, Dickie â™ª

Hold on.

Mr. Hertz, may I see your nominating petition?

Petition? Yeah.

I don't got to show you no stinking petition.

All right, that's it. That's it!

The election results are null and void.

The rally is over, get back to class!

Dean, you can't just void the elections.

I can do whatever I want.

In fact, I'm closing down the campus. That's right!

Nobody goes anywhere until I have the Pranksters.

Well, as long as I have everyone's attention,

there's just something I wanted to clear up.

My boobs are 100% real.


[students yelling]

â™ª Prove it, prove it, prove it

â™ª Prove it, prove it

Fine.

[students yelling]

Settle down!

This is the Pranksters' fault!

They will pay.

I can't believe he called me smarmy.

Tough break about the election.

All my life it's been that way.

What way?

Being small and having a name like mine totally blows.

If only there's a way a guy like me could get even.

What are you good at, Dick?

Me?

Flying model airplanes.

But what the hell good is that?

[glasses clinking] [people chattering]

Some wild happenings today at Tres Rios High,

shut down after a near riot.

A female student exposed herself, apparently in protest.

An anonymous source sent in this tape.

[students yelling]

Are you happy?

All right, settle down, settle down!

You've got to wonder, what are they teaching these kids?

This is Mary Dilts reporting live from Tres Rios.

I don't understand, why is this happening?

You know, Joseph, there seems to be a method

behind the Pranksters' madness.

What are you talking about?

Perhaps they didn't intend it,

but it is as if there is some benign higher power

that is guiding the outcome of their mischief.

Are you nuts?

We wouldn't be together if it weren't for them,

and their pranks aren't really malicious.

In fact, there seems to be

a kind of irrepressible life behind it.

A kind of music, if you will, that sings.

â™ª I am alive


You're getting too way out for me, Madeline.

All I know is we're being made a laughingstock.

Kids are running wild.

Have you ever stopped to think that education

is not about appearances and control?

What?

What I mean is maybe we

have been taking ourselves a little too seriously?

â™ª Na, na, na

Do you hear the music, Joseph?

â™ª Da, da, da, da, da

[Uplifting Greek music]

Hey boss.

Everybody's going to die.

But serious people in big hurry.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Spit it out. You feel better.

If a friend was in trouble

and it was partly because of you,

you'd help them, right?

Even if it got you in trouble?

Zorba say life is trouble.

To be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble.

And what if it cost you what you wanted most?

Boss, long time ago, I learned one thing.

Some things are more important than what I want.

One of them is friend.

[birds chirping]

And so, Mr. Stavros.

It's Karas.

Thanks to a tip from another student,

we apprehended Larry Fasco.

Then the other boys, including Chris, turned themselves in.

Needless to say we were shocked.

You called me in here to tell me my son is playing a joke?

Propagating phony articles,

sabotaging the Spring Follies, mocking the Dean.

These are serious charges, Mr. Karas.

Students have been expelled for less.

However, over my strong objections,

the administration is taking a lenient approach.

What's that?

Community service.

Yeah, Chris and his cohorts will be assisting

the janitorial crew at Tres Rios

after school and on weekends,

from now until the end of the semester.

With no pay?

Sadly without pay.

And I should add that if there are any more incidents,

anything at all, the administration won't hesitate to expel.

Do I make myself clear?

Crystal.

Thanks so much for dropping by.

[car engine]

I'm sorry dad.

For what?

For getting in trouble, for you having to go down there.

You really show that the joker, the Dean,

fooling around with a woman?

Oh yeah.

We heard him messing around backstage.

Bare ass naked?

He was well on his way.

[Stavros laughing]

I would do a job half price to see that.

Wait, listen, I wanna talk to you.

Maybe I haven't been a good father.

No it's okay, dad.

No, no, no, no, listen to me.

I want you to know I'm proud of you.

For what?

For doing good in school and and holding a job,

and for growing up without a mother.

And putting up with me.

That's not easy, I'm sure.

It's fine.

And one more thing. What?

For showing that joker, the Dean,

bare ass naked.

[Stavros laughing]

I can't believe you flashed the entire school.

In Europe it's cool, but what were you thinking?

I don't know, Kassandra, things are happening.

It's like the whole world has gone totally whack.

Even me. Shut up.

No, and the strangest thing is all of a sudden

I just realized that I've just been

this big tease for years.

Shut up!

No, look at the way we dress.

You know, I felt like I was just revealing myself

once and for all.

And I just felt like I was giving something back.

What's more au courant?

Fishnets or these stockings?

Ew!

Shut up forever!

What has gotten into you, Blotto?

I told you, call me Enzo.

Do you see what I mean?

And then they find out that Chris Karas,

the brain A student has been pulling all those pranks.

No. Yeah, and Eric Hood.

I mean, who knows what's going on with him?

[upbeat jazz music]

Wow. This place is jumping.

I thought you'd like it.

So are you getting totally psyched over graduation?

No, not really.

Everybody makes this big deal about high school.

The way I see it, it's just four years of your life.

Not even the most important ones at that.

Yeah, it'd be pretty pathetic to think

that your life peaked at 17 then went down the toilet.

Hey, I almost forgot. I got you something.

This is the most inspired gift anyone's ever given me.

Wow, you must not get very many gifts.

I didn't expect it from you.

You don't have to look different to be different.

I guess not.

So what's next?

House in the burbs? Hybrid minivan?

Yeah, right.

I don't know. All I know is what I don't want.

What's that?

The program, it's over.

I'm not going to college. Not right away, anyway.

Well, I thought you were going to UCLA.

I decided not to play ball, so they said adios.

It's cool.

I could use a break.

What about the other half

of the supercilious senior couple?

Mariah?

She's the nicest girl I've ever met,

but I'm not in love with her.

I want to break up with her, I just can't bring myself to do it.

It'd break her heart.

Hey, it's too bad about Chris and those other guys

getting busted, huh?

Yeah.

I never would've made it through chemistry

without Chris's help.

Wish there was something I could do.

All right boys, after you get done here,

Dean wants you to clean up by liberal arts.

Then behind the bleachers, including the porta-potties.

Oh, great.

[car braking]

Go ahead, take five.


Ah!

The dance of the Kama Sutra!

[students laughing]

Do it with me, come on!

Don't mind them.

How's it going?

Not so hot. Can we talk?

Yeah, sure.

It's not that I don't like Eric.

He's one of the most wonderful boys I've ever met.

It's just, I don't love him.

Why don't you just tell him?

I can't bring myself to do it.

It'll break his heart.

Yeah, if I had a girlfriend like you and you dumped me,

I'd be pretty wrecked.

If had a boyfriend like you, I wouldn't be dumping him.

You hardly know me.

I'm getting to.

I'm probably not experienced enough for someone like you.

Heck, I've never even had a girlfriend.

That's pretty lame, huh?

That's not unusual.

Besides, Eric and I

never really got that, you know, intimate.

You never?

No, never.

Wow.

I don't feel so bad now.

I was beginning to think

I was the last virgin on this earth.

No, my greatest fear is that I would die before I did it.

That's silly.

Oh yeah, very funny.

My sex life is the Gobi Desert and you're laughing.

[Mariah laughing]

You're funny.

I never knew that about you.

â™ª Make me wait

Listen, you better get back.

Thanks for talking.

No charge.

â™ª For us to speak

Oh, one more thing.

â™ª No one really gets me What?

â™ª The way you do

Sometimes it rains even in the Gobi desert.

â™ª To be with you so

â™ª If you ever wonder

â™ª I'll never walk away from you â™ª

â™ª Away from you now

â™ª And when you need a shelter

â™ª I'll never turn away from you â™ª

â™ª Away from you

â™ª Always dancing when there's no music â™ª

Yes!

Since you came forward and admitted responsibility,

then performed three weeks of community service,

the superintendent has decided

you can give the graduation speech.

Really?

I mean,

thank you, Dean.

Thank the governor for cutting school funding.

The programs are printed.

We don't have the budget to change them.

If it was up to me, I would have canned your speech.

Deep breath, deep breath.

Okay.

I'm gonna to give you one final warning,

and I want you to take it very, very seriously.

I'm listening.

I'll be watching your every move.

If you deviate by even one syllable

from the speech you gave at trials,

I will cut you off at the knees.

You and your buddies will never see a diploma.

Do you understand the implications of that?

A life of serving pizza?

If you're lucky.

Get out.

Sir?

What?

I was just wondering about the scholarship?

Selection committee holds

its final meeting this afternoon.

More than that I can't tell you.

Okay, thank you.


three, two, one!

Boo!

[kids cheering]

Let's go, baby!

Well, they say it ain't over 'til it's over.

But this time, sports fans, it is really and truly over.

Except for the ritual ceremonials.

How could I forget?

Graduation!

Last chance to suck up.

What a chance it is.

Come on man.

I thought we said we were gonna lay off of Chris.

Did I say Chris was a suck up?

Far from it.

Au contraire.

Our fearless leader has demonstrated epic loyalty,

and he has perfectly positioned himself

to pull off the ultimate prank.

Oh, I told you what the Dean said.

If I do anything, we all go down.

Yeah, of course he's gonna say that,

it's his job to say that.

But look, the fact of the matter is

he's not going to do a thing.

I don't know about that.

Well, I do.

But hey the problems of four little people

don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

Look here's the point, Chris.

All our lives we've been looking for a chance

to show how we see things, to make a statement.

That's what the Pranksters are all about, right?

Yeah.

Tonight you have the opportunity

to do what no Prankster has done before.

Turn the boring, suck up graduation speech

into a complete travesty.

A defining moment.

One we will remember for the rest of our lives.

Now are you gonna do what someone else wants?

What everyone else expects?

Or are you gonna to step up and do what you know is right?

[gentle music]

â™ª Sometimes the sky is so gray

â™ª There's no way the sun's right there above it â™ª

â™ª But it is

â™ª And sometimes you say it's pointless and useless â™ª

â™ª It's not worth it

â™ª But it is

Mariah.

We need to talk.

Yeah, I know.

You do?

I've been wanting to tell you something for a while.

I didn't know how.

What?

We need to break up.

â™ª Miles to go

Really?

â™ª You don't need tears if you don't care â™ª

â™ª And you'll never

I'm so sorry.

I didn't want to hurt you.

It's okay, really.

I understand.

â™ª It's easy

Are you sure?

â™ª So why should we try to change anything â™ª

â™ª There's a million ways to get lost â™ª

â™ª But just one way to the right place â™ª

â™ª There's no shortcuts in this life â™ª

â™ª The road is hard but you gotta try â™ª

â™ª To do right

â™ª Yeah you gotta try

[students applauding] â™ª To do right

Thank you.

It is my privilege to announce to you the winner

of the Outstanding Teenagers of America scholarship.

Each year, this award is given to the student

who best exemplifies the values

of academic achievement, participation in school activities

and community service.

Not to mention sucking up.

It is my pleasure to present

this year's Outstanding Teenager, Bradley Burris.

[students applauding] [Bradley laughing]


Thank you.

Okay! All right, all right, all right son.

Let go.

I would like to take this opportunity

to extend my gratitude to all the special people

who made this possible.

[huge fart sound]

As I was saying.

As superintendent,

I've seen a lot of graduation ceremonies,

and for me the most moving part is the student speech.

A carefully selected young man or woman

stands before us and addresses the topic

of growing up and moving on.

Tonight we have a very special young man.

Chris Karas, please welcome him!

That's my son!

[audience applauding]

Time to step up, dude.

Superintendent, Dean Pecarino, faculty members,

and last but not least, the graduating class of Tres Rios.

The years spent at Tres Rios are inexpressibly important,

for what we learn here will affect us deeply,

now and for the rest of our lives.

I'm sorry, but I can't give that speech.

It's the speech the administration expects me to give.

My friends, they want me to give a different speech,

but I can't do that either.

The truth is,

I'm a Prankster.

That's it, you're toast.

No diploma, get off.

I said get off!

I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster too.

I'm a Prankster.

Okay, fine, hey.

You guys don't graduate either, great.

I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster. I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster. I'm a Prankster.

I'm a Prankster. I'm a Prankster.

I am a Prankster. I'm a Prankster.

I am a Prankster. I'm a Prankster.

I am a Prankster. I'm a Prankster.

[students yelling]

Now what do I do?

Let him speak.

Ehhh

For me, being a Prankster

has been about being true to myself,

but now it's time to move on.

If there's one thing I can say

to my fellow graduates, it is this.

Each and every single one of us is different,

and that's okay.

I know it's hard feeling that sometimes,

because we're afraid.

We wanna be like everyone else,

to do what's expected to be popular.

But the truth is,

there's nothing wrong with being ourselves.

What else can we be?

It seems to me that life is a journey of discovery,

one that takes courage and trust.

And when we reach the end of our days,

we may ask ourselves, did I follow my dream?

Was I truly myself?

But if we would just

let go into the mystery of that journey,

then surely it will be one worth taking.

Thank you.

[students cheering]

Good choice, Joe.

All right, everybody graduates.

[students cheering]

[upbeat music]

Congratulations, get that smile off your face.

Carol Saviski.

[eagle cries]

Boss! Boss!

Beautiful speech, beautiful!

I'm so proud.

Thank you, Uncle Nick. It was kind of improvised.

Oh, it was beautiful.

Your father and I, we have something fantastic to tell you.

Okay. One minute.

Congratulations young lady.

Thank you.

Okay, I have to tell you something.

And I have to tell you something.

First, you were absolutely wonderful.

And second, Eric and I broke up.

You did?

Yeah.

He took it kind of hard,

but I think he's gonna be okay.

So I guess I'm gonna be a free woman at Western.

That's kind of what I need to talk to you about.

Wait boss.

One minute, uncle, please. Not now.

I won't be going to college, Mariah.

Well at least not to Western,

because I needed to get the scholarship.

Wait! What?

Unbelievable good news.

Here, listen to your father.

I think it's good the speech you give.

And I think it's good to show the Dean

fooling around with a woman.

Anybody gonna do that, they're going to go far.

Okay. And the other part?

Oh yeah.

I talked to my friend Costas from the Greek American club,

and he told me about some big scholarship they have.

So I put your name in, and guess what?

You win!

No way. For real?

I am witness.

Oh!

Thank you dad!

Thank you, thank you.

Oh, thank you so much.


That is awesome.

Isn't it beautiful, Pookie-kins?

Something I'll treasure for the rest of my life.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

You know you'd think at a time like this,

you'd be a little more supportive.

Can you think only of yourself?

What are you doing?

Treasure this, Bradley-kins!


â™ª Don't have a future

Don't worry son.

There'll be plenty more of those in your future.

Dad.

Shut up!

â™ª Let's not fall back

Ooh!

What shade is that lipstick?

I don't know, here.

Just take it.

Thanks.

â™ª I don't wanna

Oh Eric!

I heard you and Mariah broke up.

Want to go to a party back at my house?

Did I hear the word party?

'Cause as luck would have it, I'm available.

All right.

Leave your baseball cards at home.

You got it.

â™ª I cannot remember

She's sweet.

What in the world are you wearing?

Oh, it's a miracle bra.

[metal clanking]

So I guess we made it home free, hey buddy?

Yeah.

I only have one regret.

We didn't pull one last prank.

Are you sure about this?

Yeah.

[electric buzzing] [yelling]

Holy crap!


â™ª Bounce, bounce, bounce, come on â™ª

â™ª Bounce, bounce, bounce

â™ª It's like score sayzee, mixed with four leg... â™ª

â™ª Lost in the grill with a pitchfork, baby â™ª

â™ª Stand tall since we exit Broadville â™ª

â™ª Then rip the match like reflecting God's will â™ª

[plane buzzing]

â™ª World's rat race, I'll celebrate the last place â™ª

â™ª Sounds like a panic attack

â™ª So the photo was blurred when the camera... â™ª

This is great!

â™ª Flashback to Oliver, he was cracked like â™ª

â™ª Alexander is the new plan

â™ª Come over here with my brothers â™ª

[rocket whistling]

[fireworks exploding]

â™ª Your swagger, you're playing from a scene â™ª

â™ª To the arm and hammer...

â™ª I am, from the block infested â™ª

â™ª I do not pass Go, and do not collect shit â™ª

â™ª Oh

â™ª Your family's burning, but the fact is known â™ª

â™ª So when the image gets killed â™ª

â™ª You'll find the state of flow, you know â™ª

â™ª Da, da, da, da

I cannot believe this, everything is out of control!

What am I going to do?

Kiss me, you fool!

[upbeat Greek music]




[upbeat music]


Eric!

I heard you and Mariah broke up.

Do you wanna go back to my place to go to a party?

Sorry. [laughing]


Hey.

If you guys didn't know I was a dude,

would you think I was sexy?

[sexy growl]

[driving rock music]

What am I going to do?

Kiss me, you fool!

No!

You can't even fake kiss me!

My chin!

Am I that despicable?!


[tinkling chimes]
