Hey. -Hey. -Mike, guess
what I got behind my back.

Do I have to? -Oh,
yeah. -A cello? -No.

What do you know? Where'd
you find that? -In the back.

I've been looking for this thing ever
since I bought the place. -What is it?

It's my old lucky ball.
-It's his old fruity ball.

I used to bowl with this
thing when I was a kid.

That's sweet. That is sweet.

It is very sweet. Very sweet
indeed that Ed Stevens used

to bowl with a woman's ball.
-It's not a woman's ball.

Why, just 'cause it's pink?
-The engraving on the ball says

"Fran Jesperson." Fran.
-We agreed long ago

that the name Fran was gender
ambiguous. (<i> applause</i> )

You're gender ambiguous.

Hey, Phil, what's going on?

Our young Lothario here has
vowed to ask his paramour

for her hand in marriage if and only
if he bowls a strike on this next ball.

Really? -That is so romantic.

Ed, you know what
you should do? -What?

Lend him your ball. You
know, for a little Lady Luck.

Emphasis on "Lady." -Excuse
me. Wait. Excuse me. -Hi.

I'm Ed Stevens. I own Stuckey
Bowl. -Hi. I'm Ari. Nice lanes.

Appreciate that. Look,
this here's my lucky ball.

So if you'd like to
use it, it's all yours.

Okay, cool. Thanks.

(<i> laughs</i> )

Oh, my God, he's
really going to do it.

It's got to be some kind of joke.

Barbara

will you marry me?

Yes.

(<i> applause</i> )

(<i> rhythm guitar playing</i> )

â™ª I'm in the sky tonight â™ª

â™ª There I can
keep by your side â™ª

â™ª Watching the wide world
right, and hidin' out â™ª

â™ª I'll be comin'
home next year. â™ª

.:: Prijevodi - Online ::.

Ed. -Yeah?

We want to get married
right here. -What?

We want to get married
right here at Stuckey Bowl.

You... when?

This Saturday night.

(<i> cheering</i> )

And you're all invited.

(<i> enthusiastic cheering</i> )

You can't get married
because you bowl a strike.

You can't get married
because you bowl a strike.

Will you please agree with me?

I agree with you.

Okay, then.

WARREN: I'm going to tell
you a little something.

To please a woman, one
must employ a skillful blend

of tenderness and raw power.

Cheswick, it's been three weeks

since you were up on that mountain

with Donna Totsie.

I'm getting sick
of hearing about it.

Ah, Mark, my fine, virginous friend.

Yeah, jealousy doesn't suit you.

My guess is, you didn't
lay a hand on her.

(<i> laughing</i> )

Well, unfortunately, I'm
too much the gentleman

to convey the details
of my interlude

although I will let
on that I experimented

with certain maneuvers

heretofore attempted
only in the Orient.

Yeah, one-man maneuvers.

Once on HBO

I saw a woman who had
a 90-minute orgasm.

MARK: Oh, lookey, lookey.

Here's your little friend now.

WARREN: Ah, I had a feeling
we might run into her here.

What, she didn't call you last night

to tell you where
she was going to be?

No, it's not that kind
of relationship, okay?

Now you-you guys
just try to act cool

for once in your life, all right?

(<i> sighs</i> )

Hey, Donna.

(<i> clicks tongue</i> ) Hi.

(<i> laughing</i> )

MARK: She's probably
still shuddering

from the tenderness of your touch.

Shut up.

(<i> chuckling</i> )

Mr. Stevens.

Yeah.

Could you put these
shoes in a safe place

till the wedding?

Yeah.

So, you guys are really thinking

about going through with this, huh?

I bowled a strike.

Yeah.

It's fate.

Can't turn your back on fate.

(<i> chuckling</i> )

Fate, well, I mean...
wh-wh-what if I...

what if I took this
coin, and I flipped it

and I said, "If it comes up heads

then you shouldn't get married"?

Okay, but you know what I mean.

How old are you guys?

We're 22.

ED: How long have
you known one another?

BARBARA: Six months.

Yeah... look, Ari, Barbara...
I-I'm just a guy, okay?

Just a guy named Ed.

I'm just a guy named Ed
who happens to be a lawyer.

I'm just a guy named Ed
who happens to be a lawyer

happens to run a bowling alley.

I'm just a guy named Ed... Ed.

What?

Right. Don't do this.

Don't get married

because you happened
to bowl a strike, okay?

Get married because you've spent
a lot of time with one another.

You've gotten to know one another.

Get married because
you're absolutely positive

that you're meant to spend
the rest of your life together.

You get married because the thought
of living without one another

is absolutely unbearable.
Get married for these reasons.

Okay, not because
you bowled a strike.

Do you understand
what I'm saying? -Yes.

Okay. ARI: But you're
forgetting something.

What's that? -I bowled a strike.

Excuse me.

Will you folks be
needing a<i> huppa?</i>

Okay, before we finish up today
we need a new literary quote

of the week for our board.

Anyone?

Come on.

Anything based on any of the reading

that we've done this year.

No?

Mr. Vanacore, how about you?

You have yet to grace us
with a quote of the week.

Mark?

"Just do it"?

(<i> laughter</i> )

Not exactly what I was
looking for, but not bad

under pressure.

Ms. Vesey, excellent
lesson plan today.

It was organized, concise

and you're really starting
to come into your own.

Thank you very much, Warren.

Yeah, so, listen

you know how, um, like,
I'm a great lover, right?

Pardon me?

I'm just saying that
you probably just assumed

based on the way I comport myself.

I'm going to agree
because I feel that

that will make this
conversation end more quickly.

Right. Uh... so,
there's this girl...

Donna Totsie.

Whoa.

How do you do that?

You're like Kreskin or something.

It's like I'm sitting here naked.

Warren, I'm not blind.

I heard about your little weekend

up on the mountain.

Yeah, well, I... I
think I blew it with her.

Why is that?

The window closed on me, Ms. Vesey.

The-the window?

Of opportunity.

The window of opportunity.

I was up on the mountain, and
it was open, and I<i> choked.</i>

I blew it.

You're going to have to give me

a little more to go on here.

Well, what I'm trying to say is...

nothing happened.

See, I...

We didn't even kiss or anything.

It's, like, all we did was talk

and stuff.

What's wrong with talking?

No. Oh, you don't understand.

Nothing. Nothing's
wrong with talking.

Talking is great.

I mean, but like... I mean,
after you talk you got to, like

start kissing and stuff, or else...
that's when the window closes, you see?

And once the window
closes, that's it!

I mean, it's never going
to open up again. -I see.

Yesterday, I ran into her,
and she just, like, dusted me.

She just, like, walked right by me.

I was, like, "What's up?"

Warren

did it ever occur to
you that she's worried

her window of opportunity
with<i> you</i> has closed?

Whoa.

(<i> gasps</i> )

(<i> knocking</i> )

Yeah.

Ed Stevens?

Yeah.

Jamie Masters.

Hey.

Uh, Twizzler?

Uh, no, thanks, I-I'm good.

Oh.

(<i> both chuckling</i> )

Can I help you

with something, Mr. Masters?

Oh, I-I need to get
a restraining order

against my brother.

Oh. Sure. Have a seat.

So, what seems to be the problem?

He's ruining my life.

How so?

Ed, I have a weight problem.

Oh, I-I mean, I don't...

Come on, I'm a fat guy.

Okay.

Now I've been on every
diet known to man.

Fiber bars, breakfast shakes,
liquid protein low carbs, high carbs.

I've tried it all.
Never any luck. -Well...

losing weight can be difficult. -So, a
couple of months ago, my doc tells me

I'm one burrito away from
exploding. -Really? He said that?

Ah, not exactly. I'm being colorful.
-I see. -But I get his point.

You know, if I don't turn it
around, it's bye-bye, Birdie.

Well, how does this
involve your brother?

Well, I'm upset, so I go to my brother
Steve and I give him carte blanche.

Carte blanche? -I told him
that until I lose 30 pounds

he has carte blanche to do anything
he wants to stop me from eating badly.

What does that mean exactly?
-I told him even if I change my mind

even if I beg him to leave me alone,
don't stop. My life's at stake.

You know, he has to do
whatever he needs to do

to prevent me from eating badly.
-So, why the restraining order?

Well, the whole thing's
gotten out of hand.

It started with a polite
reminder, then... Oh, my God.

He followed me here. -Followed you
here to see if you'd eat a Twizzler?

He's got a baseball bat!

Quick for a big guy.

JAMIE: Wait!

Stop! That's my brand-new Taurus!

You like Twizzlers, Jamie, huh?

Go ahead, eat 'em up! JAMIE:
I-I'm throwing them out. Okay?

Too little, too late, tubby, huh?

I've got a very interesting job.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Mr. Masters? Steve Masters?

You're the guy from the bowling
alley. -Yeah, Ed Stevens.

I'm, uh, your brother,
Jamie's attorney, actually.

He got a lawyer? -Yeah. -Why?

Because you smashed up his
car, among other things.

Look, I know Jamie
asked you for help

losing weight, but you're
taking things too far.

You've got to stop doing this stuff.

I've got to stop doing this stuff?

Look, my brother's standing
at a fork in the road.

Either he loses weight or he dies.

And I'll tell you this,
he's not dying on my watch.

Okay, but do you think you
can come up with something

a little more productive than humiliating
him and destroying his property?

Hey, he asked me to do this.

He made me promise to do this

and I intend to live
up to my promise.

Look, no matter how good
your intentions may be

what you're doing is still illegal.

If you don't stop, I'm going
to have to take you to court.

Illegal? -Yeah. -I don't think
it's illegal. -Sure, it is.

I have a signed contract from
Jamie. -What? -That's right.

I'd be happy to send you a copy.
Spells it all out in black and white.

Jamie has given me the
legal right to do anything

and everything to stop
him from overeating.

It stipulates the
contract remains valid

even if he changes his mind.

Huh.

How can you say that Jim
Morrison was not a poet?

I didn't say that, Mark.
I didn't say that.

What I said was that
when I assign you

to memorize a classic American
poem you can't just walk in here

and recite "Riders on
the Storm." -Why not?

It's beautiful.
(<i> bell rings</i> )

Okay, Lizard King.
That's all for today.

Class dismissed.

WARREN: Hey, Donna.

Hey, Donna. -Yeah?

Hey, I was, I was, like, curious
about something. -What's that?

Well, I just wanted
to ask you a question.

I just... bounce an
idea off you. -Okay.

Whenever you have
the time. -Go ahead.

'Cause I-I could-- we could-- set
something up or... Okay, uh... sorry.

Okay, um, I was just thinking
if you were interested in...

Hey, Warren.

Oh, hey, Jess!

Hey, wow, uh...

oh... Jess, this is, um...

Donna.

Yeah, we know each other.

Oh...

Linda told me you really did spend

that weekend up on the precipice.

Yes. That's pretty cool.

Cool, yeah.

Uh, I suppose you
could say it was cool.

But, um, for me the
word that springs to mind

is "epiphanous."

What do you mean?

Jessica, as I stood
atop that mountain

with the majesty of
God's creation at my feet

life's biggest questions suddenly

made their answers known unto me.

Like, what questions?

Like, "Who are you?" I mean, I know

I know you're Jessica Martell

but, like, who are you?

I don't know.

Exactly. Exactly. That's it.

And I do know.

So, who are you?

Who am I?

Mm-hmm.

I'm Warren Cheswick.

But not just Warren Cheswick.

I'm<i> Warren Cheswick.</i>

You know?

Well, that's, that's awesome.

It was awesome.

It was intense.

Well, I got to go to French class.

Okay.

I'll see you later.

Yeah, catch you later.

So, I...

The window...

it is closed.

Oh...

Now, Mr. Stevens, perhaps
your client ought to explain

what his brother has done

to necessitate this
restraining order.

Oh, of course. Go ahead, Jamie.

Thanks, Your Honor.

(<i> clears throat</i> )

January 10, I ate a Pop Tart.

Steve flushes my best pair of
dress socks down the toilet.

January 16...

I eat a slice of pizza.

Steve spray-paints the
words "Captain Tubby"

on my front door.

January 21, I consume

a few too many individual
servings of pudding

and Steve burns my entire collection

of Jack London first editions.

Good-bye,<i> Call</i>
<i> of the Wild.</i>

Adios,<i> White Fang.</i>

Please, lower your voice, huh?

I'm sorry.

February 3, I take one
bite out of a pound cake--

one bite, so help
me God, Your Honor.

Steve calls the guy who works
in the cubicle next to me

imitates my voice and
asks him out on a date.

February 9...

Oh, that's enough. Thank
you, uh, Mr. Masters.

Have you exhausted
all non-legal methods

to stop your brother
from harassing you?

I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

Yeah, all right.

Uh... I'm going to issue a restraining
order effective immediately.

Thanks, Your Honor.

Thank you.

Come on. Hug the fat guy.

How are the wedding plans going?

All according to schedule.

When did you become the sworn enemy
of crazy, romantic spontaneity?

I thought that was your, your deal.

It is, I just want the both
of them to wait, you know?

At least until they're sure
they were meant to be together.

I don't want them to make
the same mistake I did.

Marrying Liz?

Yeah.

How did you guys end
up together, anyway?

She was my dental hygienist.

We fell in love while
she was showing me

the proper flossing technique.

Seriously? No.

I just didn't want to deprive you
of the super cute meeting story.

No, she was, uh, she was friends with
Bruce Cawhill, my law school roommate

and he set us up.

The minute we laid
eyes on one another

it was, like... boom!

Really?

Yeah, we had one of those
first dates where you end up

staying up all night, staring
into one another's eyes.

Mmm.

Four months later, we were engaged.

Four months?

Yeah.

Wow! Four--
I had no idea.

Yeah, it took another three years

before we knew each
other well enough

to realize we didn't
belong together.

I don't want these kids to make
the same mistake, that's all.

Look, I can see
that you have a point

but what if you're wrong?

What if Barbara and Ari are
actually perfect for each other

and they're supposed to
live happily ever after?

If I'm wrong, they can wait a
couple years, then get married.

Yeah, but sometimes in relationships

there's this, this
window of opportunity.

And, and if you miss it...

Eddie! ED: Hey.

Jamie.

Jamie Masters, Carol Vessey.

Carol Vessey, Jamie Masters.

Hi.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

You gave me my life back.

See, there comes a point in time

when you've got to realize,
you are what you are.

I'm overweight. So what?

You know, there are
worse things to be.

STEVE (<i> over megaphone</i>
): Ladies and gentlemen

please direct your attention
to the giant fat guy

in the blue windbreaker.

My God

would you look at
that fat ------- eat?

Would you look at him?

Does this look like a guy

who needs to be
pounding down hot dogs?

Eat, you fat
-------, eat.

He can't do this.

He's violating the
restraining order.

You're violating the
restraining order.

Screw the restraining order.

Forget the restraining order.

I'm taking him to court.

I want my car fixed. I
want emotional damages.

I want it all.

I'm taking him to court.

I am taking him to court.

Okay, calm down, Jamie.
We'll, we'll work this out.

Next question

have you gotten your blood tests?

No, we were going to go to the clinic
tomorrow. -Not necessary, my friend.

I have an old summer camp buddy
who can take care of this for you.

What you're going to do is
go down to the filling station

at the corner of Forbes and Murray.

CAROL: Hey, guys. -Beep me.

Hey. BARBARA: Hi.

So, guys, we have the most
perfect idea for our wedding.

What's that? -My best man's
going to be Colonel Sanders.

The chicken guy.

Isn't that an amazing
idea? -Wow, isn't he dead?

Yeah. -No, no, you're
thinking of Arthur Treacher.

BOTH: Oh.

Yeah...

Yeah, yeah. All right.

I don't think I can do this.
CAROL: Do what?

Participate in this
wedding. -Why not?

You hear those kids
out there? -Yeah.

They want Colonel Sanders to be their
best man. -Yeah. -Colonel Sanders?

So? -This is marriage
we're talking about.

They're not taking the
whole thing serious enough.

Marriage, the blessed union,
the sacrament, man and woman.

Do the words "Till
death do us part" ring

any bells with you?

Yeah, I'm so confused.

In marriage, you don't throw

a fanciful restaurant
mascot into the proceedings.

Ed? What?

This just doesn't sound like you.

Aw, I just don't want to sit idly by

and watch these two
kids gallop down the road

towards misery, that's all.

Colonel Stupid Sanders.

I think that you're
missing the point here.

I'm missing the point?
I'm missing the point?

Yep, little bit. How?

What do you think the point is?

I think the point is,
it's not a bad thing

to want Colonel
Sanders at your wedding.

It's a bad thing if
only one of you wants

to have Colonel
Sanders at your wedding.

PHIL: Okay.

They got me.

I let down my guard,
and they got me.

I've decided to take care
of the catering F.O.C.

F.O.C.?

Free of charge.

And if you repeat
that, I will deny it.

There are reasons why
people in this town

need to think of Phil Stubbs
as a soulless merchant of fear.

Oh.

(<i> bell rings</i> )

Donna, Donna.

Yeah?

Hey.

Look, uh... what I was
going to ask you before was

um, will you...?

Here's the question.

Um...

Will I what?

Will you go out with
me Saturday night?

Okay.

Really?

Excellent.

Oh, yes.

Okay, um... uh,
yeah. Saturday night.

Saturday night.

Okay.

Hey, she said...

Oh... hey, Donna.

Um, just so we're clear on
this, um, when I say "go out"

I mean, like, on a date,
and not just as friends.

Yeah, I kind of figured.

Awesome. 'Cause, you see, my buddy,
Mark Vanacore he's got this theory

And he was, like, "Dude
your window's closed."

And I was, like, "Okay, son, look

I think you've been
watching a little too much

<i> Mars-Venus,</i>
you know. -What?

<i> Mars-Venus,</i> it's the TV
show that dumped Cybill Shepherd.

Remember, in, like...

You're starting to lose me here.

8:00, Park Theater. -Okay.

Okay.

See you then.

Yeah.

Your Honor, my client Steve Masters

is charged with violating
a restraining order

that I believe should not be upheld.

Why? Because his
so-called harassment

of his brother Jamie, comes
at Jamie's own request.

Jamie asked Steve to sign a contract

promising to do whatever it took

to stop him from overeating.

And I quote, "no matter
how much I protest."

You see, Your Honor

Jamie knew there would come a time

when his will would weaken

and he would want Steve to stop.

So now Steve

follows his instructions not to stop

and Jamie sues him.

Doesn't make any sense.

Mr. Stevens.

Your Honor, it's not
the restraining order

that's invalid.

It's the so-called contract.

When Jamie asked Steve
to help him lose weight

he never imagined Steve would
take things as far as he did.

Destruction of valuable
personal property

public humiliation.

Surely the law cannot
protect this type of behavior.

JUDGE: Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

We'll begin with
witnesses tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, Mr. Masters

don't forget that there's still a
restraining order with your name on it.

Yes, Your Honor.

(<i> gavel pounds</i> )

Ah.

Should I get the kind
for sensitive skin

or the kind for
super-sensitive skin?

Since when do you need to shave?

Kevin, you haven't
even hit puberty yet.

You look like a
newborn brine shrimp.

Hey, Warren, don't forget these.

Whoa, whoa.

Mark, I'm not going to need condoms.

We're just going to the movies.

Besides, my mom shops here

so can you get rid of those?

These are the kind
that Jeff Goldblum uses.

I read it in<i> Esquire.</i>

Hey.

Big weekend.

(<i> over P.A.</i> ):
I need a price check

over here.

No!

How much is the Ultra Shave Gel?

It's cheap.

Steve, Mr. Samuels.

STEVKnock it off Hey,over there.

i My client wishes
to settle this case.

No way, no how.

Steve, you should listen
to what we have to say.

You're not going to win in court.

JAMIE: We're brothers.

We don't belong in a court of law.

How crazy is this?

Look, I'm willing to forget
about the money and the damages

if you'll just agree
to stop harassing me.

ED: You can't win, Steve.

There's no way the judge

will uphold this contract.

Will you boys excuse
us for a moment?

I need to talk to my brother.

He's right.

I'm probably going to lose in court.

But lucky for me, we
ain't going back to court.

What do you mean?

I bought myself a
little insurance policy.

A 30-second commercial

on tomorrow night's local news.

If you don't drop this case

and let me keep
helping you lose weight

the whole town's going to see this.

What is it?

I'll see you later, Jamie.

So?

Do you have a VCR in your office?

Come on.

You sure you don't want
to watch this yourself?

No. You're my lawyer.

Plus, I don't have any
skeletons in the closet.

I've got Ring Dings in the pantry

but no skeletons in the closet.

That's my house.

That's me.

I... yeah.

He's going to run this on TV?

If he does that, we'll sue him.

We're already suing him.

If he runs this on TV

I'll be the laughingstock
of the community.

We got to drop the case.

We can't do that, Jamie.

This is blackmail.

If you let him get away with this

it'll just get worse.

Trust me, we'll deal
with this in court.

Now we really need to start
focusing on party favors.

You know, little
keepsake, knickknack

for your guests to take home.

Oh, I don't think we need that.

Now, my cousin Jeal can
engrave absolutely anything.

He once put a bride's initials
on a cocker spaniel's ---.

The man's an artist

and I will give him a holler.

CAROL: Hi, guys.

Hi.

Hey, Barbara. Hey, Ari.

Guys, we've got some bad news.

What's that?

Colonel Sanders
can't be our best man.

No.

Really?

He died in 1980.

Gosh. Hmm.

They sent us a coupon

for free honey barbecue wings.

Hey, look, you guys

you know, I don't mean to sound like

a broken record on the subject

but I'm just not certain

you're taking this whole
thing seriously enough.

Sure, Ed.

We could hold off for awhile.

Maybe in a way that's
the wise thing to do.

But I feel like for whatever reason

we've been given this magic moment.

And I don't want to just
sit around being wise

until that moment passes.

Yeah, but if the magic
were to pass that quick

maybe you shouldn't
be getting married.

I think you're missing my point.

Look, Ed

If you want us to have our wedding

somewhere else just tell us.

Ari, it's not that I want you
to get married somewhere...

Don't be ridiculous.

Don't be ridiculous.

Of course you're
getting married here

and you know what?

It's going to be

the greatest bowling
alley wedding ever.

Thanks, guys.

Thank you.

There you go.

All right. Take it easy. Bye now.

What are you doing?

If they're going to marry

they may as well get married here.

What chance do you
really think this has

of working out?

About as good a
chance as any marriage.

Maybe better.

Look at them.

Oh.

Yeah, I know.

But I just think that they should...

Maybe it will work
out, maybe it won't.

Who knows?

Things go wrong for
all kinds of reasons.

But who are we to stand
in the way of something

that is so obviously meant to be.

Well, I don't think
they should split up.

I just think they should wait.

Waiting has its own set of problems.

What if they start
thinking too much?

What if they start
second-guessing everything?

There's such a thing

as being too cautious, isn't there?

first came to you

with this crazy "contract..."

Objection. We don't think it's crazy

and we think it's a
contract, not a "contract."

Sustained.

What was your
brother's state of mind?

Upset, confused?

Yeah, he was upset.

He'd tried every diet
known to mankind and failed.

He even tried that guy
Jared's thing from Subway

but he didn't have any luck

so he came to me for help.

And you proceeded to
spend the next few months

humiliating him and
destroying his property.

That's what he asked me to do.

That's what he asked
you to do? Really?

So he asked you to smash
his car with a baseball bat?

He asked you to follow him around

with a loudspeaker?

He asked you to videotape him eating

without a shirt on in
the privacy of his home

and threatened to
put it on the news?

He asked you to do all these things?

Well, not those
things exactly, but...

You and I both know that when
your brother came to you for help

he did not plan on any of
this happening, am I right?

I don't know.

You don't know?

Nothing further.

Did you, in fact, do all
those things to your brother?

Yes.

Why?

His cholesterol is 450.

His triglycerides are over 300.

He's a borderline diabetic.

If he continues to
eat the way he's eating

my brother will die.

Steven Masters...

I believe that you care very
deeply about your brother.

And in some circles

your actions could
be considered noble.

But unfortunately, the law
is not one of those circles.

As Mr. Stevens has argued

the agreement between the two of you

does not constitute
a binding contract.

Therefore this court rules

that you must stop harassing
your brother immediately.

However, because of
your good intentions

I'm dropping any claim
for damages against you.

This time.

Dismissed.

Do...

(<i> clearing throat</i> )

Do you... do you enjoy
going to the cinema?

Yes, Warren, I enjoy
going to the cinema.

Me, too.

I also like going to the movies.

Oh, I...

To... touch... e

uh, touche.

Warren, you don't need
to be nervous around me.

Okay.

Hello. Welcome to Park Theater.

What can I get for you today?

We'd like two medium sodas
and two small popcorns, please.

This is a small.

That's a small?

Mm-hmm.

Okay, we'll take two mediums then.

For a dollar less...

you get the large.

All right, we'll
have the large popcorn

and two medium sodas.

You've got to make one
of the sodas a large

to get the combo.

Okay, like...

we can't eat that much popcorn

and drink that much
soda, you understand that?

For the love of God, no one can.

You see these two
containers right here?

Yeah.

These right here
represent your best value.

If you want to buy 32
of these little guys

be my guest, go ahead.

I'm just trying to
protect you from yourself.

Do you even want popcorn?

No, okay, we'll take
this... whatever.

Just take this.

Thanks.

It's expensive.

All right, you go ahead.

I think Jessica Martell
likes you, you know?

What?

No way.

I'm serious.

I saw the way she was looking
at you during group project.

No way. That's... Really?

No.

No, I'm telling you.

I'm not here with Jessica Martell.

I'm here with Donna Totsie, so...

Thank you.

You know, Donna

a woman is like a flower.

You have to feed her
and water her or else...

(<i> yells</i> )

Oh, my God.

(<i> alarm blares</i> )

Oh, man.

I'm fine, I'm fine.

It's cool, it's cool.

A sneaker caught in the escalator.

Oh, my God.

A foot caught in the escalator.

Excuse me. Excuse me, could you...?

Excuse me, could you stop?

Okay, okay, don't move, okay?

Don't go anywhere.

All right.

Could you tell the
manager to turn off...

the escalator has my...

It's going to eat my foot.

That's cool, though. It's cool.

Walk on by.

Hey, have a good night.

I'm just caught in the escalator.

MAN: We come here today

to honor Barbara

and Ari in this blessed event.

Hold on! Hold on!

Heck, you can't have a
wedding without a best man.

Thanks, Ed.

You guys screw this marriage up

I'll have to hunt
you down and kill you.

We won't.

I know you won't.

I had a really great time tonight.

Really?

I mean, cool.

Yeah, cool.

Me, too.

Any date that involves
the Jaws of Life

can't be that bad, right?

Unless...

you were in a car accident.

Warren, um, how...

how come you never kissed me

on top of Mt. Precipice.

Oh, that's...

that's a great question really.

I... I...

just... I don't know.

I was looking for
a sign or something.

Like a signal.

Oh, I just figured you
weren't interested in me.

What?!

No, no, no, no.

That's crazy.

I... I'm...

I'm very interested in you.

I possess a great
level of interest...

in you.

You just needed a signal?

Yeah, you know, 'cause then like

I thought...

I thought I missed my
window of opportunity

'cause you and I
never like, you know

kissed up there or anything.

So I figured it was over

and we'd just be friends and stuff.

Mm-hmm.

You just...

needed a signal?

Yeah.

Like... just like

a look or...

a tap on the shoulder that said

"hey, Warren, now is a
good time to kiss me here."

Like, like something like that.

Warren, shh.

Stop talking.

Okay. All right, cool.

Cool.

Good night.

Good night.

Whew.

â™ª Call me unpredictable â™ª

â™ª Tell me I'm impractical â™ª

â™ª Rainbows I'm
inclined to pursue â™ª

â™ª Call me irresponsible... â™ª

Just like to say to
the bride and groom

may your love and
happiness last a lifetime.

â™ª Yes, I'm unreliable â™ª

â™ª But it's undeniably true â™ª

â™ª I'm irresponsibly
mad for you. â™ª

â™ª Ooh, I'm irresponsibly mad â™ª

â™ª For you. â™ª

You know, you really should consider

keeping Stuckey Bowl open
for weddings more often.

I don't know.

One may be enough.

Not many people want to get
married in a bowling alley.

You think?

It's sort of nice.

As a matter of fact, when I get married
I'm considering doing it right here

at the old Stuckey
Bowl. -Hey, no problem.

You know, as long as
it's not league night.

I think those kids
are really in love.

Yeah, so do I.

But then again, who knows?

'Cause it's all just one
big crap shoot anyway.

I guess you're right.

You can only be so sure,
you know what I mean?

You just got to take the plunge
let the chips fall where they may.

I think I just used two cliches
in the same sentence.

Does this mean you're
coming around on fate?

Fate?

I'm a big believer in fate.

In fact...

If I bowl a strike I'm
going to ask you to marry me.

Is that so?

Mm-hmm.

What's that? -That's me
moving to the edge of my seat.

It gives me a chance
to pick up the spare.

What that's going to get you?
-One night of unbridled lovemaking.

Oh, dream on. Dream on.
-Come on, it's fate.

(<i> laughing</i> )

It's fate. I don't even
want to but it's fate.

There's nothing we can do. -You
don't even want to. -I don't want.

You are messing with the pin gods
here and I will not be a party to it.

I'm serious. I'm serious, too.
