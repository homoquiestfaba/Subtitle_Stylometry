NEWS REPORTER: ...a rocky week
for Governor Jeffs

amid allegations of corruption

relating to the oil industry
and political favors.

This morning,
the governor followed through

on his promise of law and order.

Cartel underboss Juan
Miguel Prado was executed,

in what was the state's
first capital punishment case

in more than seven years.

Governor Jeffs, then prosecutor,
was in attendance

and is holding
a press conference now.

DOC: Fuck is he doing?

Shouldn't you be there?

He's running the show now.
He's the boy wonder, remember?

We had a deal, Billie.

Richard: What I witnessed
this morning

was the State exercising
its right to capital punishment.

REPORTER 1: Mr. Governor,
will you address the...

I need to tell you
this is gonna be a problem.

This is not good.

He's gotta look tough
on crime and the Cartel.

People are scared, Doc.

We just executed Prado's brother

and now he's gonna
take a victory lap.

You gotta talk to this guy.

You know him.

Guys like this will sell
their children to win.


want me to say, huh?

Are you seeing them today?

DOC: Yeah. Okay,

so we don't know
what we don't know.

You'll see them
and then we'll go from there.

"We don't know
what we don't know"?

REPORTER 1: Mr. Governor,
will you address

the corruption allegations
reported against you this week?

Reports that you were
directly compensated

for the Keystone deals?

Those claims are baseless.
Next question.

REPORTER 2: Mr. Governor,
why did you feel

you had to attend the execution?

Well, I was the prosecutor
in the Prado case.

I felt like I owed it
to the families of his victims

and to Mr. Prado, to see
this through to the end.

REPORTER 2: What did
you owe Mr. Prado?

As a reminder

to him and to his brother,
Lalo Prado,

and his heinous
criminal organization,

that this state
and this great country

won't stand for their kind.

[WOMAN CRYING]

With this new Task Force,

I'm going to make it my mission

to eradicate
the Cartel's presence here,

specifically Lalo Prado.

Today's execution
was the first step.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

Next time I'm in that room,
it'll be Lalo on the table,

getting the needle.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

[BIRDS CHIRPING][MUSIC CONTINUES]

CUCO: [IN SPANISH]
Are you okay, brother?

LALO: Yes.

And you?

Yes.

I should have never
trusted the Americans,

his life was worth more...

You told me not to.

CUCO: There was no saving
Miguel, Lalo.

But now...

They're spitting in our face.

And a task force against us...

These are diplomats, Cuco.

Politicians.


And this is America,
not Mexico, we're talking about.

[IN ENGLISH] The United States
doesn't own its people, Lalo.

[IN SPANISH] We do.

[IN ENGLISH] Let me do this,
Brother.

[IN SPANISH]
What would Poppa say to us?

You can never let man
catch you looking up to him...

...or he will look down
on you forever.

Have you thought about

Yeah. Yeah?

The mountains,

It's expensive. I've been saving up.

I have a presentation tonight. About what?

I did it on you

to have a dad
who served in the CIA.

Right.

Well it's... it's just
a little different, that's all.

Billie told me
she's gonna help out

Well, you don't go over there

She should realize that...

you can't keep

I'm here for her, not you.

Honey, do you want another one?

No, thank you.

Can I get a minute?

[POLICE SIRENS WAILING

They're gonna respond, Billie.

Yeah. What did he say?

Nothing. Which is worse.

Okay. So what do you wanna do?

Talk to Rich, tell him to

cool it with the white knight
bullshit, all right?

I don't even wanna think
about what they're gonna do.

You can't do that. Why?

Well, you can.

But he doesn't know everything.

So... What doesn't he know?

He doesn't wanna know,
that's the agreement.

What doesn't he know,
Billie? Oh, come on, Doc.

I've had my arm
up the ass of people like Jeffs

for the past 30 fucking years.

They get to put on their hats

and wave to everyone
from the parade floats,

but they're bouncing
on my fucking knee.

He may be a war hero
in your world,

but here in mine,

Jeffs knows what I tell him.

Right.

What haven't you told me,
Billie?

Tonight is a busy night, Doc.

Why don't you call

maybe we can schedule

It needs to be tonight, Clarke.

What didn't you understand?
The answer is no.


Look at me, look at me.[GROANS]

[LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING]

What is it?
Clarke said it couldn't wait.

Go ahead, Billie.

BILLIE: Damn it.

It's the Prado thing.

We need you to back down
from the Task Force

and let this whole thing
die down a bit.

Why would I do that?

I just announced it.

Remember when you were running,

"Whatever needs
to be done," right?

I told you whatever it is,
I didn't want to know.

Where do you think those large,

anonymous contributions
came from,

or the overwhelming
Hispanic vote, huh?

Those things aren't won
at the fucking wishing well.

What are you saying?

a few partners in this thing.

Prado?

How does this happen?

I'm the sitting
fucking governor.

Everyone makes
their deal with the devil.

This one is yours.

What does he expect
from this deal you made?

We look the other way on things
concerning his interests.

What the fuck
are you saying to me?

Not all, just some,
he's practical.

And most you don't need
to be aware of

because you have Doc and I.

I mean, you hired
me to fucking win.


so shocked, Richard.

Naive doesn't look good on you.

We just executed his brother.

You kill three civilians,
you get the needle,

that's the deal.

Lalo knew
we couldn't save his brother,

but I told you, don't dance
on his fucking grave.

Look, this is just a pit stop.
We thread the needle here

then we get to D.C.
after one term.

Don't shit your pants on me now.

And with this Keystone thing...

How do you figure

I can't think of a reason.

Do you know
an associate of hers,

Yes, yeah, I do.

We have reason to believe
that he is connected

to the Prado organization.

What makes you think that?

that showed up

for Prado's brother's execution.

He also matches
the description of an individual

leaving the warehouse
earlier today.

Doc was my superior officer,
we served together.

I know him to be a troubled man.

If you think
he's connected to the Prados...

we have to consider
him dangerous...

to do to apprehend him.

Okay.

They needed something big

to deflect
from the oil scandal, okay?

And it came up
and bit her on her ass.

And you didn't know about this?

Oh, come on. [CHUCKLES]
I mean you... Seriously?

What, they played you
like they played me?

Give me a fucking break.

[CLOCK TICKING]

Where's Rich now?

He's at the mansion.
He took his family out.

But he's all in, bro.

Hey, you see
the last press conference?

Yeah.Okay.

Now he's gonna take
on the Cartel,

like the big man
that he thinks he is.

It's fucking simple, Doc. Who's Cuco?

That's who's doing this? Yeah.

He's, um, Lalo's half-brother.
Okay, he's the one

that everybody forgets
to mention. He's...

he's the one
with the most to prove

because he's a fucking American.

Real name's Raffe.

But, down in the Sandbox,
he's known as Cuco,

and that means, loosely
translated, "Bogeyman."

[UNSETTLING MUSIC PLAYING]

All the mass graves down there

and the kidnappings,
and the bombings,

and all the murders
and shit, that's him, bro.

That is him.
I met him once with Billie.

When we were down
in the compound, Zaragoza.

Now, if he's got your kid,

I really am sorry, I really am,

but that's got nothing
to fucking do with me.

Zaragoza?

It's a fucking fortress,

like you see
in the fucking movies,

all right?

And then villages
all built up around it.

Jesus Christ, man.

What do they want? What, Jeffs?

They want his head.

What? His head.

Literally?

This is a nightmare to me.

So what are you gonna do?

Anything I have to. Then what?

I'm sorry about that, Karl.

What do you want?

You don't want to know.

Listen, I'm sorry about Billie,
I know how close you were.

But she was fucking using you.

It was her idea
to raid the warehouse.

Her idea to take on the Cartel.

They got Nell.

Oh, my God.

Please let me help, I can help. Too late.

Wait, they're not gonna hurt
Deb and Taylor, are they?

Are you? No.

I won't.

Come on, Doc.

Oh, fuck, God help me.


You know what I thought
about the other day?

That Fourth of July

at the lake, Billie's house.

You and Carla were
together I think.

Yeah.

It was right before
my last tour.

Yeah.
Kids must have been six, seven.

to get married

under the fireworks.

We had a wedding
for them on the dock.

Riggs was the priest. [SIGHS]

I was Taylor's best man.

And you walked Nell

Hey.

CARLA: Hey, where are

Where is she?

I can't tell you that, Carla.

Did you hear
what happened to Richard?

Yeah. I heard.

There was a girl
in there with him,

his press secretary, I think,
it's all over the news.

Deb is hysterical.

But they won't tell her
anything else.

What's happening, Doc?
Are you guys gonna be okay?

Nell's a tough kid, Carla.

I know.

She's gonna be fine, sweetheart.

Doc, listen,
I'm sorry about what I said.

I am still so angry with you

and it drives me crazy
that no matter what,

she'll always love you more.

You're her idol, Doc.

She also knows
what you're capable of.

So wherever she is...

I'm sure she knows
you're coming.

Look, I gotta go.

Your papa's coming.

Your papa is a bad man.

That's why you don't scare me.


No? Mm.

Most little girls
get really scared.

Not you, huh?

You shouldn't have
killed that lady.

But she didn't listen.

She didn't listen to me.

How can you do that?

When was the first time
you killed someone?

When I was a boy.

Younger than you.

What happened?

I was a bastard.

My mother was an American...

but she was also a lady
of the night, you could say.

My skin was lighter
than all of my brothers,

so no one believed
I was a son of Antonio Prado.

And my mother
was a very beautiful woman.

Beautiful.

She died when I was 13.

And my father,
he always made sure

I was taken care of.

But his wife never accepted me.

There was one boy in town...

he called my mother a whore,
the day after her funeral.

So I followed him home
that day and waited.

That night I snuck into his room
and cut his throat.

What happened after that?

No one ever talked
about my mother again.

And what about your dad?

We became very close.

And he knew
what you did to that boy?

My father knew everything
that happened in his town.

So you like it?

I'm a good at it.


Are you sick
to your stomach now?

I thought I didn't scare you.

I don't like burgers
without ketchup.


The girl wants ketchup. [LAUGHS]

All right.

MAN: Right there. That's where
I saw him coming out of.

[TRAFFIC RUMBLING LOUDLY][GUESTS

Now look at you.

Fucking head in a bag, great.

You know, I hadn't thought
about that lake trip in years.

I forgot about it.

And the kids...

married under the fireworks.
God, that was a fucking...

God damn it,
that was a great weekend.

You know, I think
that was the last time

that Carla and I were in love.

It was when I came back
from that last tour,

you remember?

It was fucked up, man,
I couldn't handle it.

Something changed inside of me.

You remember.

I couldn't deal with anything.

And then the whole
husband and daddy thing,

I mean, fuck me.

Everybody was so fucking normal.

I just saw some fucked up shit.

You were running for Office.


And then the divorce, man.

And you know, somehow
I was the pariah.

You know,
nobody wanted to fucking deal

with the basket case.
