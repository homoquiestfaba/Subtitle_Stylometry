I'm an attorney and this
isn't how I argue a case.

You're getting on my nerves!

This buiIding has been here 75 years.
It deserves to remain for the community...

...because it represents
the ideaIs of that time!

The community deserves to have
this as a Iandmark. It is something to--

And we're removing it from
our chiIdren's chiIdren. You go back here.

This a community theater, and everyone
shouId benefit from this buiIding!

This is your Iast warning!
We got a permit to take down this buiIding!

I have a permit that aIIows me
to gather for the purpose...

...of expressing my constitutionaIIy
protected right of free speech!

-You want to get kiIIed, Iady?
-Sir, according to city code--

-Forget about your code!
-Section 245: If a Iandmark's committee....

-Forget about the code, Iady!
-When a Iandmark's committee decision--

-Lady, you're in vioIation here!
-Have you ever read the Constitution?

Take it up, CharIie!
Watch this constitution.

-Do you read?
-Come on, cIear the area!

Yeah, you're cIear. Go ahead.

Okay, you guys,
this is just a scare tactic.

-That's aII this is.
-WeII, it's sort of working.

MeryI, they do productions from the Y here,
productions with IittIe peopIe!

The Nutcracker and Hair. We have
to Iie down in protest. Take out your mats.

Here, I've got your protective eye gear,
your sun bIock and your wet naps.

-Everybody, Iie down in protest!
-You better get out of the way.

-We wiII prevaiI!
-You wiII go to jaiI!

Tom! Lock arms.

-I'm not feeIing great about this.
-Have a IittIe faith, pIease.

MeryI, wouId you marry me?

ReaIIy?

Oh, my God! Yes!

Shut this down, CharIie.

-I Iove you.
-Hey, you guys, they stopped.

You're good Iuck. There is justice
in the worId. We prevaiIed!

Lunatic!

Crazy Iady!

-We shouId caII our parents.
-Guys, here are your wet naps.

-Oh, thanks.
-Thanks. We had a good time.

-I'm gIad. Bye.
-Bye.

Bye. Thank you.

I'II pay you back
this time, guys. I promise.

What are parents for, if not to baiI
their daughter and her friends out of jaiI?

So did they knock it down?

I'm not getting through to peopIe.
Why don't peopIe respond to me?

Honey, Wade Corporation is not peopIe,
it's a heartIess profit machine.

And it's getting worse aII the time.

They're bidding
on the Surf Avenue Iot.

They wanna put up condos
and tear down the center.

Wait, our community center?
My community center?

Come on, honey,
Iet's discuss it over dinner.

No, Dad, you know what? I'm just tired.
I think I'II just go home.

Hi, honey, it's Ansel.

I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
make it back for your birthday.

We got a lot of new trainees onboard
and they put the green in Greenpeace.

But I'm saving whales
and thinking of you. Love you.

Yeah, hi, Mr. Wong. Lucy KeIson.

Fine. I wouId Iike a number 1 7...

...a number fou-- Number five.

No. Number seven? Seven.

Can I get the number four
without the garIic sauce?

Okay, and then maybe
two orders of number 26.

And....

Yes, it's for one.

And that's it.
No! Give me a number eight.

Give me two number eights.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay. Bye.

When they toId me I'd been chosen
the MedicaI Center's Man of the Year...

...I assumed it had
something to do with...

...the miIIions we have contributed
to the new pediatric wing.

But as it turns out, I had my appendix
removed earIier this year...

...and under anesthesia,
I apparentIy proposed marriage...

...to every nurse in the hospitaI.

IncIuding the many attractive maIe nurses.

Why are pediatrics
so important to Wade?

I think feet are very important,
aren't they?

I'm just teasing. I know there's
more to pediatrics than feet.

-Thank you very much.
-Thank you. AIways nice to see you.

-George, congratuIations.
-Hey, Terry, how are you?

-StiII sIicing peopIe up?
-Indeed.

Yeah, I bet you are.

Hi, there. Oh, yes, the EmiIe famiIy.
LoveIy. So good.

-Hi.
-Nice to see you. Take care.

MeIanie Corman.
HospitaI administration.

My friend EIaine Cominsky wants
to meet you, but she's shy. Is that okay?

That's fine. I've been too nervous
to meet EIaine myseIf.

-Good. Don't move. Great tie, by the way.
-Thanks. I was rather nervous about it.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-Hey, your brother wants to see you.
-What? Now? Tonight?

Yeah, that's what he said. AIthough
sometimes it's hard to teII with the accent.

This is EIaine.

-Oh, heIIo.
-Hi. WouId you sign my GO?

Oh, GO! I see what you mean.

Sorry, I thought it was a medicaI term.
You had me aII excited.

-''To EIaine, George Wade.''
-Thank you.

Hang on just one second.

There's no way I'm running up
to Westchester just because he caIIs.

It's absurd. He'II just have to wait.

-Right on. Hey, man, forget him.
-Yeah.

-ShouId I get the car?
-Yes, get the car.

-Good evening, Mr. George.
-Good evening, Rosario.

-ExceIIent new hairdo.
-Mr. George.

No, I'm serious. You Iook Iike
a young ImeIda Marcos.

-HeIIo, George.
-HeIIo, HeIen.

Don't you think Rosario
Iooks particuIarIy IoveIy tonight?

I hadn't reaIIy noticed.
Rosario, the chiIdren need baths, pIease.

Yes, Miss HeIen.

-So how are the kids, apart from dirty?
-They're fine.

-Can I get you anything?
-I'd Iove some MiIk Duds.

We don't have any.
I couId send out for one.

Oh, no, don't be ridicuIous.
If you're going to send out, get a whoIe box.

-Howard is in the gym.
-Right.

Forty-five minutes, 6.5 miIes an hour,
at an eIevation of three.

It's incredibIe how much
more reIaxed I feeI.

-HeIen does an hour a day too.
-Yes, you both seem extremeIy reIaxed.

You can cut the reIaxation with a knife.

So why am I here, Howie?

We Iost the West Side waterfront deaI
because your chief counseI...

...your Iatest modeI/attorney...

...forgot to fiIe
an EnvironmentaI Impact Report.

I wiII admit that the Iaw
is not Amber's strong point.

-That's why I fired her.
-No, I fired her.

Just as I fired Debbie
from St. Barts' Law SchooI...

...and Stacy from OnIine Law SchooI.

I want someone from YaIe or CoIumbia
or from the continentaI United States.

Women of that IeveI of inteIIectuaI abiIity
often find me shaIIow.

-Then hire a man.
-Don't be absurd.

Because they wouIdn't sIeep with you?

No, because it wouId make you
and Dad too happy.

Dad has been dead for 1 0 years.

WeII, there is no reason for him
to start enjoying himseIf now.

You need someone who can write
a brief instead of removing yours.

And she can handIe your divorce
whiIe she's at it.

You are stiII getting divorced?

UnIess my ex-wife decides to faII in Iove
with me again, or for the first time, yeah.

No! Why do you aIways
find that so funny?

-It's very hard to say.
-Hire a reaI attorney by tomorrow.

Don't!

-HeIIo, have a good day.
-Thank you, ma'am.

-So you're Russian, you say?
-1 00ºº.

Hence, bIond hair,
bIue eyes, cheekbones.

Sorry to have kept you so Iong, but at Ieast
I feeI I know everything about you.

And I you. You know, usuaIIy I'm so nervous
at interviews, but that was fun.

Yes. Isn't ''fun'' fun?
It's been a pIeasure, Tiffany.

Mr. Wade? Mr. Wade?

Hi, I'm Lucy KeIson. I'm an attorney.

Have you ever heard
of Saint-Tropez Law SchooI?

-No.
-Shame.

-Where did you go to Iaw schooI?
-Harvard.

-Harvard?
-Yes.

Intriguing. TeII me more.
What's your background?

I don't see how that's reIevant.
I work for the CoaIition for the HomeIess.

-I'm working at LegaI Aid.
-That can't pay much.

WeII, I'm not very interested in money.
Now, Mr. Wade....

Wait a minute. You're KeIson.

You Iie in front of our wrecking baIIs.

-You attacked the Zegman brothers--
-I did not.

It's not my fauIt they waIked
under a protest sign.

-You're not here for a job?
-I'm here representing...

...the Coney IsIand Community Center.
It was buiIt in 1 922.

It's the heart of Coney IsIand.
It has aduIt education, basketbaII...

...CPR, Lamaze, water baIIet,
senior's tae kwon do. It's great.

For chiIdren, it's a home away from home.

I mean, I practicaIIy grew up there.

It's IoveIy, but Trump
has the inside track. Nice to meet you.

No, Mr. Wade, you don't understand.

I Iive there, as weII as my parents.

They know AssembIyman Perez,
who's on the board.

If you can guarantee the preservation
of this center, I can guarantee you the buiId.

But why us? Why Wade?

WeII, I can't get in to see Trump
and the Zegmans have a restraining order.

Mr. W?

You're supposed to be taping
The View in haIf an hour...

...and Public Policy magazine needs a quote
on the chaIIenges of urban pIanning. Hey.

Right. Yes. Quote, quote, quote, quote....

What I Iove about architecture
is its abiIity to shape a community.

This center has shaped the community!
It turns strangers into neighbors--

Its abiIity to change
strangers into neighbors.

How the right design for a park
makes peopIe feeI secure.

How a schooI buiIding can be functionaI
and beautifuI so that kids feeI....

No, the community center makes chiIdren
feeI engaged, and it aIIows them a pIace--

FunctionaI and beautifuI so that kids
feeI engaged instead of imprisoned?

-Yeah, it sounds good.
-I Iike that.

But I said a community center,
not a schooI.

I know, it's aII very good.
Jump in. Thanks.

-Nice shirt.
-Thank you.

So do we have a deaI?

No. I want something eIse from you.

No. I am fuIIy aware of your reputation
and there's no way you're getting that. No.

-Getting what?
-You know.

The sex. That's not gonna happen.

No, that wouId be nice.

I promise to save your community center.

On top of which, you can direct
our pro bono efforts.

That's miIIions at your charitabIe disposaI.

I've spent my entire Iife
working against peopIe Iike you.

WeII, maybe if you work for me,
you'II win occasionaIIy.

I need an answer, I'm afraid, immediateIy.
Here is my direct number at the Grand HoteI.

-You Iive at a hoteI?
-WeII, I own the hoteI and I Iive there.

My Iife is very much Iike MonopoIy.

And I know you wouIdn't care,
but I'II start you at $250,000.

There's aIso usuaIIy
a very nice Christmas bonus.

Thank you.

-I can't beIieve how much I ate.
-I'm proud of you.

The whoIe Ieft side of the menu.

You know when I get tense,
I just start to eat.

-Honey, you cannot work for that man.
-Hey, we can use the baiI money.

-Remember what Sun Tzu said?
-Yes.

''Keep your friends cIose
and your enemies cIoser.''

Sun Tzu didn't have a daughter.

What's this? Oh, dessert. Thank you.

It's the onIy way to save
the community center.

It is. And if I work for him...

...I have huge resources
at my disposaI for charities and sheIters....

-Yes, but--
-Mom, I promise.

I wiII stiII be your daughter.
I wiII stiII be a Iawyer.

And I wiII stiII have
aII the same ideaIs.

Let's update aII the fiIes.

EspeciaIIy the muni-codes
because I'II need those.

I'm gonna speak with Mr. Wade.

Mr. Wade, so sorry to bother.

I've been over the EnvironmentaI
Impact Reports for IsIand Towers.

-I wouId reaIIy Iove to taIk to you.
-Very good.

I reaIIy wanted to ask you:
Which one of these do you prefer?

-How do you mean?
-It's for my new personaIized stationery.

Is this a trick question?
They Iook exactIy the same to me.

No, not at aII. This is a Iinen finish
and this is a watermarked veIIum finish.

Leaving aside the fact
that they've taken perfectIy good forests...

...and denuded them in order
to produce this nonrecycIabIe paper...

...I wouId say it was....

WeII, then this one. It tastes better.

Do you know, I've asked
30 peopIe that question.

You're the onIy one to come up
with that answer.

My God, you're good.
I'm getting you a bigger office.

No, it's very sweet,
but I'd rather go over the--

Very firm.

But is it too firm?

There's some debate among chiropractors
about the optimum IeveI of mattress tension.

What are your thoughts?

If you reaIIy want to know,
the more firm the mattress...

...the more pressure on the 5th vertebra.

Quite bouncy, though. Have a bounce.

No.

-HeIIo.
-Yes, I'm gIad you're up.

I didn't want to wake you.
I just feIt Iike a chat.

George, it is 2:1 5 in the morning.

Can't you taIk to whatever
Mensa candidate you're with?

I resent the impIication...

...that because someone
may not share your high IQ...

...they're not a person
of substance and depth.

-You aII right?
-I swaIIowed my AItoid.

She swaIIowed her AItoid. That can happen.
A sudden hair fIick, very dangerous.

Okay, George, I am tired.
Put her on the phone.

You mean, put her on the phone?

Put her on the phone!

AII right. Someone for you.

-Hi.
-Hi.

The man you're dancing
with is deepIy troubIed, okay?

And even though he's rich
and attractive...

...you're too young to trade
yourseIf Iike a stock on NASDAQ...

...for someone who won't
remember your name...

...or his in the morning,
is stiII married...

...and has recentIy had
a very suspicious rash.

It is 2:1 6.

Go home, finish high schooI
and reach your potentiaI!

You aII right?

I think I'm gonna go.

-What did you say to her? Nice chat?
-Yes.

That we have to taIk about.
Now, do you think I shouId cry?

I was thinking bursts of sobs.

More of a whimper.

You're pathetic. Good night.

AII right.

I'm sure he'II be here any minute.
Is there any more Diet Coke?

Sorry, everybody.

Did I miss the bIessed event?

Check with me before you taIk.

Now that we're aII here, I'd Iike to discuss
the settIement terms.

The terms have been set.
It's caIIed a prenup.

We both know...

...that a prenup doesn't precIude
certain recompensatory--

In pIain EngIish, aIthough I can foIIow
you in German and Japanese if you prefer.

-She wants doubIe the aIimony.
-No way.

Given the situation,
it's not an unreasonabIe request.

You're referring to the aIIeged infideIity,
are you not?

AIIeged? He was having
sex with her in our bed.

I knew you were worried
about getting anything on that sofa.

-How dare you come in here--
-I shouIdn't have said that. Sorry.

PIease.

So you are saying that infideIity
is worth twice the aIimony.

Using your reasoning,
any infideIity on her part...

...wouId have to be heId against her
in a monetary accounting.

What are you suggesting?

The soon to be ex-Mrs. Wade did a IittIe
couch time with a company accountant.

And he's wiIIing to testify.

I have IoyaI empIoyees.
I think it's the heaIth pIan.

-The heaIth pIan is exceIIent.
-Thank you.

-We wiII not agree to pay any--
-We wiII pay the aIimony...

...pIus $ 1 00,000 and
a generous property settIement...

...if you reIease me from further obIigation.

-You son of a bitch!
-What?

Watch your Ianguage
or you wiII not get the estate, Mrs. Wade.

Don't caII me that!
You're just another one of his stupid bimbos!

Now, wait! She is far from stupid--

-What do you think you're doing?
-Went up my nose.

-Water went up my nose.
-It's onIy water.

Okay, this hankie is very nearIy cIean.
I'm going to dab you.

-You may bIow.
-Thank you.

Good.

Divorce aIways gives me
an appetite. Kebab?

No, I've never warmed
to the idea of a fIesh PopsicIe.

-One, pIease. Chicken, thank you.
-Why did you give her the money?

She'd never have stopped
tiII she got what she wanted.

You aIways say I have a responsibiIity
towards those Iess fortunate.

Everybody is Iess fortunate than you...

...so just give the money to someone
who's not gonna spend it on coIIagen.

You onIy want me to be generous
to those you approve of.

No. I onIy want you to
finaIIy aIIow me to do my job.

You did your job. This morning I was married,
now I'm not. You did it superbIy.

Thank you very much.

Here, that's fine. You keep the change.
Thank you.

George.

-Hey, that's my coffee, you jerk!
-Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

-Moron!
-I thought you were needy.

What's wrong with you?!
Can't a guy have a cup of coffee?!

-It's aII right. Come on, Mother Teresa.
-My onIy cup of the day! You ruined it!

Okay, now, what do you think?

Too ornate?

I don't care about the beIt.

You're upset.

Look, from now on, I'II get someone eIse
to handIe my divorces.

It's not Iike I enjoy them.

Maybe I shouId go somewhere where
no one knows how much money I have.

Where is Staten IsIand?
Why don't we go there?

Thanks, but Harvard
doesn't give a degree in yenta.

I'm not here to find you a wife
or to pick out your cIothes.

My heroes are CIarence Darrow,
Thurgood MarshaII....

Who's another non-scummy Iawyer?

My parents!
My father worked for Martin Luther King.

My mother is a Iaw professor.

They taught me that Iawyers
shouId be treated with respect.

I have compIete respect for you.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

Luce, wait. Wait!

DearIy beIoved, we are gathered here
to join together MeryI and Tom...

...as they stand before us
on this joyous day...

...procIaim their Iove and enter
into that most sacred bond of aII...

...the bond of hoIy--

Is that yours?

I'm so sorry.

PIease continue. Everyone Iooks so beautifuI.
Just keep going.

Bye. You guys, I'II be right back.

HoId this for me. I'II be back.

Twenty bucks for your cab.

Keep the 20 and Iet's have dinner.

Keep your dinner. I'II keep my 20
and we'II caII it even.

-Okay, sounds good.
-Okay, bye.

Go.

George, pick up. What's wrong?

Don't teII me that the construction permits
didn't come through...

...because I had the appIication
into the Zoning Committee by 9 a.m.

-Evening, Miss KeIson.
-WiIIie, toId you the Mets wouId sweep.

-Miss KeIson.
-Ms. Hana.

-Good evening, Miss KeIson.
-Linda.

-George?
-HeIp! I'm in my cIoset.

-What is it?
-That is a very attractive.

Okay, I'm judging the Miss New York contest
in under an hour. It's on teIevision.

What do you think?

PIease don't teII me you caIIed me out
of a wedding to heIp you pick out a suit.

-You ran out of a wedding? That's horribIe!
-You said it was an emergency!

Didn't I memo you as to what
constitutes an emergency?

Yes. Large meteor, severe Ioss of bIood
and what's the third one again?

-Death! And you're not dead.
-No.

You weren't dead when
you caIIed me at 3:00 a.m...

...because you had a nightmare about
becoming a member of KISS.

Just Iike when you barged in
on my woman's doctor appointment...

...to ask me which picture
to put on the cover of People.

I don't Iike those very much. If it's any
consoIation, I wiII be dead eventuaIIy.

Tonight is important. I'm representing
the Wade organization. That incIudes you.

Not anymore, George.

-I'm sorry?
-You got IsIand Towers, I got Coney IsIand.

Why don't we just caII it quits, okay?
I can't take it anymore.

-What, are you serious?
-Yes.

PIease, consider this my two weeks' notice.

-I find you ungratefuI.
-UngratefuI?

-Yes, ungratefuI.
-UngratefuI?!

Yes. I hire you with
no corporate experience.

I give you an apartment, a great office,
the nonfat muffin basket every morning.

-George!
-Why do you keep your phone on?

You crave the excitement.

This is entireIy my thing...

...because I've managed
to turn myseIf into this....

It's not Iike I'm enjoying it either.

Now I can't. I'm addicted.
I have to know what you think.

What do you think?

I think you are the most seIfish
human being on the pIanet.

That's just siIIy. Have you met
everyone on the pIanet?

Goodbye, George.

I don't have a shirt.

AnseI, I finaIIy quit. He caIIed me
out of MeryI's wedding.

-I'II never get that moment back.
-Okay.

I'II set up interviews with Iaw firms
that do pro bono work, and--

-All right, hang on.
-What?

Look, we're shipping out.
I gotta go. You take care of yourself.

I gotta go, hon.

Okay, just don't faII in Iove with
any cute marine bioIogists.

-Okay, I promise. Bye.
-Okay.

-Love you.
-Bye.

I am reaIIy Iooking forward
to a new chaIIenge...

...and your firm has the optimaI bIend
of pubIic and private interest Iaw.

Lucy, your résumé is amazing.
You know that.

But we do a Iot of business with Wade.

AII the more reason for me
to make a smooth transition.

-Lucy.
-Yes.

George Wade caIIed me this morning
and informed me...

...that you are indispensabIe
to his organization.

At the moment, we're not hiring.

Then why did you agree to see me?

HonestIy, we're partners
with Zodiac Construction--

They do miIIions of doIIars
of business with Wade ReaIty--

-And Mr. Wade--
-Doesn't want you to hire me.

The attorney who was pIanning
to quit reconsidered.

-When did Mr. Wade caII?
-Mr. Wade never caIIed.

-When?!
-Maybe an hour ago.

Make sure you massage his cIoven hoof!

I'm suddenIy feeIing a pain in my ass.

I am unempIoyabIe! You caIIed everyone
except for SIurpee Heaven!

That is not true. I did caII SIurpee Heaven.
They didn't want you.

Heard you had attitude.
Said you weren't SIurpee materiaI.

-You shouId reaIIy Iet us work on you.
-I don't Iike to be touched!

I'm sorry, you guys are great.
It's not you.

AII right, Iisten.

You have a contract and it says
you wiII work untiI IsIand Towers is finaIized.

Which is compIetion of construction,
or I can stop you working eIsewhere.

And there's no IoophoIes
because you drafted it and you're the best.

SubconsciousIy, I think you drafted it that
way because you don't reaIIy want to go.

Does it kiII you how weII I know you?

Honey, this contract is exceIIent work.
I'm very proud of you.

Dad, I'm trying to get out of it.

I don't know why you went to work
for that phiIandering robber baron.

You usually have impeccable instincts.

Look at your boyfriend, Ansel.
He's a dedicated environmental warrior.

This is ironcIad. Houdini couIdn't
get out of this contract.

You shouId've stayed
at the IegaI aid job.

If I do pro bono work with a company
with these resources...

-...I can accompIish so much--
-Come on over for strawberry ice cream.

Have Tofutti! You heard what the doctor
said. Your choIesteroI is over 300!

You're basicaIIy a soIid.

Two of the greatest IegaI minds
in this country arguing over dessert.

Lucy, it was your choice to work
for that man.

You couId've done anything. You couId've
cIerked for the Supreme Court.

I don't know what to teII you.

Short of going in
and deIiberateIy trying to get fired.

You stay away from that freezer!

Good morning, boys.

Sorry, I am so Iate.

That's fine. We onIy just got here.

Forty-five minutes ago.

Howie, are these your kids?

You know, I've never actuaIIy met them.

They are good-Iooking boys.

That's a girI. That's Sue and PauI.

Yes, so it is.

You know what?
She is gonna be a heartbreaker.

That's PauI.

-Yeah. Thank you.
-Sorry.

So we've got the Coney IsIand project.

I'd Iike to stir up some pubIicity if we couId.

Yes, very nice.

I'm--

I'm working on endorsements
from IocaI merchants.

We were working
on some ideas there.

I thought that was terrific.

-Pathetic.
-What's pathetic?

-You. I know what you're doing.
-I am not doing anything.

You think if you come in Iate and spit
on the boss that wiII get you fired?

Not in this company.

-Chris.
-George.

George, I have an uIcer.

I don't sIeep weII, mostIy because
you keep caIIing me at night.

If you don't caII me,
I dream you're gonna caII me.

I think about you in the shower,
not in a good way...

...but in an I'm-so-distracted-I-can't-
remember-if-I washed-my-hair way.

So I wash my hair twice.

So I have a hoIe in my stomach,
I am running out of shampoo...

...and today is the first time in my Iife
I did not give a 1 000 percent on the job...

...and I hate that feeIing!

-I won't caII after hours.
-You wiII, George! You know you wiII.

Yeah, I wiII.

I just don't think we can see each other
professionaIIy anymore.

AII right. Stay untiI you find
a repIacement.

Train him up for a coupIe of weeks,
then you can go to SIurpee Heaven.

Thank you! I promise I wiII find
you somebody amazing.

Somebody better than me
because I'm not even any good.

-No.
-A gIorified ambuIance chaser.

Thank you.

I got it. It's just my earring.

-My hair!
-CarefuI! That's my overpriced ItaIian beIt.

Just get it off!

Howard.

Join us. We were just brainstorming.

-Lucy?
-Yes.

I was thinking it might be a good idea
to do a photo op at the buiId site...

...where George wouId be in the....

George in the foreground,
pointing up to the sky...

-...Iike this.
-Yes.

Then I thought I couId take my beIt off,
as if to say, Iet's get to work!

Right. Right-o.

On behaIf of Wade Corporation,
I'd Iike to thank the Community Board...

...for giving us the opportunity
to work with you on this project.

And we Iook forward to seeing
aII of you at the groundbreaking.

I did weII with those eight peopIe.

-I thought you were fantastic.
-This way, Mr. Wade.

Just Mr. Wade.

-More.
-Great. Can we go now?

AbsoIuteIy. I just want to say heIIo
to my foIks.

FoIks?

Excuse me.

HeIIo.

-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Daddy.

-Is that a new coat? I Iike it.
-Thanks.

What a wonderfuI surprise!
We finaIIy meet after aII this time.

George Wade.

Mrs. KeIson, I presume.

What a pIeasure.

WeII, I can certainIy see
where Lucy gets her stare from.

I'm Larry. It's a pIeasure to meet you.

Thanks, Larry. Same here.

Thank you for Ietting Lucy quit.
It certainIy made our week.

-Great pIeasure.
-We shouId get back to the office.

-Come on! Have some cake.
-We can't.

We're two bIocks from the apartment.

-You Iive around here?
-Sure.

-What a charming coincidence.
-It won't be charming...

...once you bIock out the sun
with this condo-hoteI monstrosity!

We wiII have a sun deck.

That's something, isn't it?

Larry, Ruth, I can't teII you how much
I appreciate your support on this project.

At Ieast you're keeping
the community center.

UnIess you're wiIIing to reconsider
the entire project.

I'm afraid that won't happen.
It is over 50 miIIion in profits.

I think it's immoraI that any human being
shouId acquire that much weaIth.

I don't know how you sIeep at night.

A machine that pIays the ocean.

I used to come up here aII the time
when I was a kid. My speciaI pIace.

I had a smaII one-bedroom
on Park and 91 st.

That's so very Oliver Twist.

Times were hard. But you know what?
We were happy.

-Didn't have a view as good as this.
-It's great, isn't it?

I used to take up some ice cream
and my CaroIe King tape...

...and Iook at the neighborhood.

It's amazing what you couId see. At night,
the whoIe buiIding went downstairs.

The fathers stood on one corner.
The mothers stood on the other.

Kids wouId just ride their bicycIes around.

As you can see, not much has changed.

Mr. and Mrs. GoIdfarb wouId be sitting
in the middIe of the street...

...saving a parking space for their chiIdren
who were coming next weekend.

And you up here on your own.

It's hard to find a quiet pIace
in BrookIyn to think.

Or to repIay whatever argument
I just had with my mother.

Yes.

Yeah, she's terrifying.

I thought she was gonna kiII me
and feed me to the poor.

Yeah, she's a piece of work.

But for better or worse, she's the voice
in my head pushing me to do better.

ChaIIenge the accepted wisdom. Never
settIe for a B instead of an A on a test.

You once got a B?

-HypotheticaIIy speaking.
-Right.

Of course, no matter how hard I try,
I wiII never Iive up to her expectations.

WeII, there are worse things in Iife.
Like no one having any expectations.

There's something amuck
with this sponge cake.

Tofu.

You're not concentrating.
This offends me.

Yeah, I'm sorry, Ton.

I Iost Lucy.

I just think it's a shame because I've
come to reIy on her for everything.

And I trust her compIeteIy,
and she's funny.

Not deIiberateIy, of course.

Hey, you know, it's probabIy
for the best though.

Oh, yeah? Why is that?

Two things I know is chess and women.

Chess, it has ruIes, pieces,
rooks, knights, bishops.

They move in predictabIe patterns.
Somebody wins, somebody Ioses.

But women, they don't have no ruIes, man.

They move in unpredictabIe ways too.

Nobody ever wins or Ioses
when it comes to women.

You taIk about your feeIings
untiI your breath is sucked out your body.

AII men are pawns when it comes
to women.

EspeciaIIy a smart one Iike Lucy.
She's hard to controI.

And you know, the man has got
to be in controI.

Like with me.

I come home. When I waIk in,
I know my mama has dinner on the tabIe.

AII right, so you're stiII Iiving at home?

Yeah. Yeah.

Of course.

Here's somebody interesting,
PoIIy St. CIair.

WeII, it's a terrific résumé, PoIIy.

CongratuIations on the baby.

What baby?

Maybe you shouId check with me
before you taIk.

What baby?

I'd Iike to taIk about
your moot-court experience.

What baby?

Yeah, what baby?

You shouId do the interviews on your own.

Harry Raskin, Richard Beck.

Interesting prospects for my repIacement.
Let's see.

No, it's gotta be a woman.

What a surprise.

I suppose a certain bust size wouId heIp.
Maybe some bathing-suit shots?

It wiII annoy Howard if it's a woman.

-Thank you.
-TeII you what.

AII I want is someone
as inteIIigent as you...

...but a IittIe Iess tense
and argumentative.

A sort of Katharine Hepburn figure.

You don't deserve Katharine Hepburn.

-Audrey Hepburn.
-AIso too good.

Just stay away from the Hepburns.

You forgot a beet.

Beet.

Thank you.

I've got that charity tennis thing tonight.

And I need to know, does this shirt make
me Iook a bit kind of Björn Borg?

AnseI and I got into a huge fight,
and I think we just broke up.

ReaIIy?

He wants me to go on a Greenpeace boat.

He thinks I can't embrace Iife.

Is that the case?
Because I just don't see it.

I just don't see it.

And by the way, how can I embrace him
when he is never here?

Maybe it's me. Maybe the rose-coIored
gIasses have finaIIy come off.

Okay.

We obviousIy can't Ieave you aIone
with the stapIer.

I'II teII you what. I'II canceI tennis.

They aIways make me pIay with Ed Koch.
What can we do to cheer you up?

Nothing. There's no soIution.

Good. Good attitude.

I can't heIp it if I don't Iike boats.

SureIy not aII boats.

Yes, aII boats.

I don't understand.
What is wrong with me?

At the moment,
huge quantities of aIcohoI.

I don't know. I just seem
to drive men away.

There's AnseI.

There's BiIIy from LegaI Aid who ran
off with a stripper.

Don't forget Gary from the Peace Corps
who married his trainer.

Gary, yes.

What is wrong with me? I want to know.
You're sort of a man.

-AII right?
-I'm good.

So teII me. What's the matter with me?

WeII, you can be somewhat intimidating.

You couId Ioosen up a IittIe,
get in touch with your feminine side.

-Okay, that's a good suggestion.
-Perhaps soften your appearance.

Not that I don't Iove that Iook,
but you couId get doIIed up occasionaIIy.

I'm not going to spend hours
fIuffing my hair and appIying...

...animaI-tested makeup to my face...

...just so I can turn myseIf into some
maIe fantasy, degrading Kewpie doII.

UnIess I, you know, reaIIy Iike the guy
or something.

You see, maybe that's the probIem.

You don't Iike these guys.

You drive them away because you reaIize,
deep down, they're wrong for you.

They're not wrong for me.

We have aII the same poIiticaI goaIs
and ideaIs, aII of them.

Which I guess isn't very romantic,
but what can I say?

I'm fine. What can I say?
I'm just not a romantic person.

Never feIt that way about anybody.
Nope. No.

No, in high schooI, Rick Beck took
me parking. You know, parking?

And the whoIe time I taIked
about NeIson MandeIa.

Don't know why I did that.

That is hard to say. I certainIy wouId have
found it extremeIy erotic. Come back.

I'm fine.

I don't know. Maybe I'm
just not good in bed.

Maybe you're not.

I am.

-Yeah?
-Yeah. I am reaIIy good in bed.

-You might be Iousy.
-No, beIieve me, paI.

You shouId be so Iucky because
the IawyerIy exterior...

...don't Iet that fooI you because
inside I am, Iike, a compIete animaI.

It's, Iike, bobcat. You know, it's scary.

-I can see that it might be.
-No. No. Look, I can bend Iike a pretzeI.

I'm serious.

And I'm not taIking the straight kind.
I'm taIking, Iike, the twisty kind.

Twisty Iike the bobcat,
saIty type of pretzeI.

Because that's what men want, right?

-That is their dream.
-The twisty-bobcat kind of pretzeI...

...because that's what you want, and I bet
I couId give you a twisty-bobcat pretzeI.

Do you want it?

You're a reaIIy good Iistener.

Luce?

Luce?

Are you...? HeIIo?

Cormac!

HeIp!

HeIp!

I'II just get her upstairs.

Think you can make it?

No. No, Iet's put her somewhere eIse.

Good.

Good.

Like a doII.

A doII with a sinus probIem.

We shouId put a piIIow under her head.
I think that heIps.

Good.

Much worse. Interesting.

Do you think we shouId change
her cIothes?

Right. Don't know where that came from.

Morning!

Okay, not so Ioud.

We didn't....

Last-- We didn't....

It was a magicaI night.

You made sounds I've never heard
a woman make before.

We didn't....

Not physicaIIy, but spirituaIIy,
you were the best I've ever had.

Whatever I did or didn't do
or said or didn't say...

...it was aII a IittIe mistake.

WeII, nothing happened.

That's a reIief.

I'm very busy. I have work to do.
You stay there and reIax.

Okay, I'II see you Iater.

Lucy!

Jesus, carefuI.

There's a June Carver to see you.

-June Carver, June Carver, June Carver.
-She went to Harvard.

Yeah, weII, so did I. Now Iook at me.

Norman. Norman. Norman.

-Norman!
-Sorry.

She didn't have a strong background
in property Iaw.

She's down from Boston.
She onIy wants five minutes.

Lucy.

Lucy.

This is June Carver.

-Hi. It's a pIeasure to meet you.
-You too.

I don't have an appointment,
so feeI free to throw me out.

WeII, I have security on standby.

-Have a seat, pIease.
-Thanks.

Did you have CriminaI
with Professor Rappaport?

-Oh, my God. I'm stiII shaking.
-Yeah.

But I have to teII you, Miss KeIson,
you are a Iegend there.

-Me?
-Editor of the Law Review.

The articIes you wrote on
the Richmond case. You're an inspiration.

WeII, yeah, I--

I don't have a strong background
in property, but neither did you...

...and Iook what you've accompIished.

WeII, you know, not that much, reaIIy.
I just--

And there's this.

I've never met Mr. Wade...

...but in Public Policy magazine
he was interviewed...

...about the chaIIenges
of urban deveIopment and he said that--

Is it ridicuIous that I'm quoting this?

No, not yet.

''Architecture can shape a community
and turn strangers into neighbors.

The right design for a park
makes peopIe feeI secure.

A schooI buiIding can be functionaI
and beautifuI...

...so kids feeI engaged instead
of imprisoned.''

When I read that, it made me feeI
I'd be working for a cause...

...not just a company.

Okay. You're hired.

You're Mr. Wade.

Someone has to be.
AIthough, I didn't write that.

-Lucy did.
-No, you did. I remember being shocked.

We've been working together so Iong
it's hard to remember who did what.

-Sounds Iike an amazing team.
-George, do you mind--?

I was saying how incredibIy presumptuous
it was of me to come waItzing in here...

...but Miss KeIson was nice enough
to see me.

They're caIIing from
the Zoning Commission, Lucy.

June, why don't we set up
a proper interview for tomorrow.

It's aII right. It's aII right.
I couId finish up with June.

You're not coming to the meeting?

-Have I ever come to the meeting?
-Good point.

-AIrighty.
-AIrighty.

Stupid pIant. Do something
with this, wiII you?

AbsoIuteIy. The ficus is fired.

-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

-So teII me...
-Yes.

-...first of aII, you come from which--?
-Harvard.

I was just wondering, are we stiII on
for the Mets game tonight?

I Iove basebaII.

So are we stiII good?

I'm a Red Sox fan, aII the way.

A Red Sox fan? Interesting.

You obviousIy have a rich fantasy Iife
which is a fabuIous pIus in this company.

Okay, that means you're a Boston girI,
probabIy a IittIe bit Irish, CathoIic...

-...big famiIy, dirty, that kind of thing.
-ExactIy.

Let's go, Mets! Let's go, Mets!
Let's go, Mets!

Strike him out!

So, what did you think of June?

Loved her. Loved her.

Great. Yeah, me too.

Yeah, she smiIed obsequiousIy,
fIattered me constantIy.

She'd have no probIem picking out
an ottoman. ExactIy what I'm Iooking for.

A tad weak on the experience side, but--

We went out for a drink,
taIked for an hour.

She's a very cIever girI, you know. Sharp.

So you guys went out for a drink and....

She got nowhere to stay at the moment,
so I found her a room at the Grand.

And I invited her to the company outing.
Turns out she's a usefuI tennis pIayer.

WeII, I can swing a racket.

Yes, I know, at my head.
I've experienced it.

But Iisten, thanks to you
for finding her. Genius.

Oh, God! It's gonna hit us!

Get out of the way. Move!

-Mike, you aII right?
-Yeah.

-Take it easy, the season just started.
-Thanks, George.

Next time, go to a Yankees game.

Hey, Iook, you're on TV.

I don't hear you.
I don't hear you.

Nice!

-Nice one.
-Thank you.

-Three-Iove.
-AII right. CooI.

Nice.

Yeah!

Mine, mine, mine! Okay!

Come on!

Lucy! Oh, my God, Lucy, are you okay?

Do I have a concussion?
Ask me something.

-Name aII the Supreme Court Justices.
-Thomas, Ginsburg, ScaIia, Stevens...

...Kennedy, Rehnquist, Souter, Breyer,
O'Connor. Is that right?

How shouId I know?

Want some?

Thanks, I reaIIy shouIdn't.

Okay.

You think she's a naturaI redhead?

You know, I was gonna give June a Iift,
and then Howard offered.

The fact that he Iiked her is
a big strike against her.

AIthough I wiII say she's
an exceIIent tennis pIayer. Very nice form.

-FantasticaIIy nice form.
-Oh, man.

IncredibIy Iithe.

What? I thought you Iiked her too.

No, I jus-- I think I just ate too much.

ReaIIy? What did you have?

Just a chiIi dog and some fries
and a soda...

...and a bag of some IittIe girI's
cookies...

...and another chiIi dog
stuck in there somewhere.

Okay.

Let's try and take your mind off it.

Okay.

Heard from AnseI IateIy?

I'm sorry.

I've been thinking about this.
You shouId move on. Forget him.

PIenty of other pebbIes on the beach.
The worId must be fuII of men who'd die...

...to be with a compuIsive
eater who can't faII in Iove.

What? I've faIIen in Iove.

-Yeah?
-Yes!

With whom, might I ask?

And no pets.

BiIIy Westhouse.

BiIIy who?

Westhouse. I knew him in high schooI.

Did you teII BiIIy that you Ioved him?

Did you say, ''BiIIy, I Iove you''?

Goodness!

It's not funny.

Sorry.

That Iast chiIi dog is reaIIy barking.

It's not perfect timing, I must say.

We'II be in the city in 20 minutes.

I don't have 20 seconds!
I feeI Iike I swaIIowed a cruise missiIe.

What--? What am I? 5 years oId?

-It's onIy a VoIvo.
-WeII, peopIe just don't go in VoIvos!

-I'II buy you another VoIvo.
-No!

That'II be the onIy thing you'II ever
remember about me.

I'II be the woman who went
on the front seat!

That wouId be hard to forget.

Okay, I have an idea. See that RV?

-Yes.
-That is our target.

Can you make it?
Therein Iies your saIvation.

-No.
-Yes, it's an exceIIent idea.

-It's uncIean! I can hoId it!
-It's a brain wave. Out of the car!

I can hoId it! George, I can hoId it!
I'm hoIding it! I'm fine, I can hoId it!

No! No, no, George, I don't want--
I'm not going. I'm hoIding!

Hi there!

-You aII right?
-Yes.

-Okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

-You aII right?
-I'm good.

-What?
-My ankIe. My ankIe.

No! No, no! Oh, God! No!

Hi, there!

Oh, God!

Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

I'm not insane, but my friend needs to use
a bathroom. It's an emergency.

-I'II give you $ 1 00.
-A thousand!

Okay.

Thank you. Very sweet of you.

Thank you.

CIean, cIean, cIean.

Where are you guys from?

WeII, Kentucky originaIIy,
but now this is pretty much home.

Come here, babies.

Hurry!

What kind of miIeage do you get
out of this thing? It's an RV, right?

A recreationaI vehicIe?

Traffic's moving.

HoId it! HoId it! HoId it! HoId it one sec!

Honey, how are you doing?
Are you nearIy ready?

KiII me!

Look at that poor jerk.

Yes, poor jerk.

Whoa, NeIIy.

George, where's the car?

I'm sure it's been safeIy towed by now.

Oh, God! George, George, George!

Don't worry, don't worry! In many ways,
it was the perfect end to the day.

Except for those poor chiIdren
in the traiIer.

They actuaIIy Iooked quite frightened.

Don't worry, I won't teII anyone.

Once it's pubIished in the company
newsIetter, there'd be absoIuteIy no point.

AII right, I'II caII for a Iift.

WouId you Iike to have
your naiIs done?

A HoIIywood tan, perhaps?

God, it is such a beautifuI city.

And my favorite buiIding of aII time.
Look at that.

Nirosta steeI, sunburst tower,
gIeaming gargoyIes...

...aII designed by a man caIIed
WiIIiam Van AIen...

...obsessed with beating
his former partner...

...who was buiIding the
Bank of Manhattan tower at 927 feet.

So Van AIen announced
the ChrysIer BuiIding at 925 feet...

...and then surreptitiousIy assembIed
the 1 80-foot mast inside the tower...

...and onIy reveaIed it after
the bank tower had been compIeted...

...giving Van AIen the taIIest buiIding
for three months...

-...untiI of course--
-UntiI the Empire State BuiIding.

AII right, pIease give me the name
of Van AIen's former partner.

Who is H. Craig Severance?

-I find you annoying.
-Yes, I'm sure you do.

But it is pretty amazing what dreams
and Iots of money can do, isn't it?

Yes, it is.

-And you know you're part of that, George.
-Yes, I am.

AII you have to do is use your power
for good instead of eviI.

If onIy I wouId.

Listen...

...I'm very sorry that these Iast coupIe
of months have been unbearabIe for you.

Not at aII.
UnbearabIe wouId have been bearabIe.

Then I suppose it's a good thing
that your two weeks are aImost up.

This is it.

I'II do the ChiIdren's League benefit.
I'II make sure June is set up.

I'II take a pass at your speech
for the groundbreaking...

...and I'II be out of your Iife forever.

Great.

Super.

-Hi.
-Hey, hey.

-I have tennis eIbow from the other day.
-Oh, yes?

-Lucy has tennis forehead. Much worse.
-Oh, no. I stiII feeI terribIe about that.

Thank God she Iooks okay.

EspeciaIIy with that big benefit
you're aII going to tonight.

-What was it again?
-It's a benefit...

...for the New York ChiIdren's League.
Lucy makes us give Iots of money...

...to heIp society and get a tax break.
BriIIiant.

-Sounds exciting.
-It wouId be aImost impossibIe...

...to teII you how boring it is.
LargeIy because it wouId be too boring.

WeII, boring to you might be scintiIIating
for a girI from PIainview, Wisconsin.

See you Iater.

What about, if you're not busy...

...a bunch of us are going,
do you want to come and be bored?

I'd Iove to.

-AII right. See you Iater.
-Okay.

Oh, good. These need to go to Accounting.

-The Ioan agreements need to be notarized.
-I got it.

-Here's the Zoning Commission reports.
-Now you can start with the appraisaIs--

ActuaIIy,
I don't know how much time I have.

George sort of asked me
to go to the benefit with him tonight.

Great.

I just have to figure out what to wear.
I don't have anything.

-''I don't have anything.''
-God, she's nice.

No, they're very good muffins.
They just need more fat.

George, sign these
or we defauIt on five different Ioans.

-Take care.
-WeII, hang on. Hang on.

-I need to go over my speech.
-Sorry. I gotta run.

We'II pick you up at eight
and go through it in the car.

I asked June to come.
Hope that's aII right.

Oh, that's dandy, but I don't need a ride.
Thanks.

-HeIIo, Howard.
-George...

...I just received new estimates
on Island Towers.

Costs are skyrocketing.

It will be cheaper to just knock down
the community center.

What are you taIking about?

We onIy got the job because we said
we'd keep it.

-We said we intended to keep the center.
-No wait. You can't--

This is nonsense.
You can't just decide uniIateraIIy.

-I'm coming over.
-George.

I want to take a nap before the benefit.
It's all very simple.

Why can't we just buiId the towers
over the center?

Because it will eat away our profits.

There's to be a groundbreaking ceremony
at Coney Island...

...with our friend Assemblyman Perez.

All I need
is one of your charming speeches.

WeII, you're not gonna get one.

I need you there.

-I have to consuIt my scheduIe.
-No, you won't, George. It's your job.

You're the pubIic face of the company.
They don't want to see me.

I can't for the Iife of me think why not.
You're magnificent.

Look, whatever we Iose on this deaI,
I'm in for haIf.

You'II be in for nothing
at the rate you're going.

Expensive divorces, pooIside parties
at the hoteI for 1 000 peopIe...

...incIuding fireworks
and a performance by Sting.

That was one speciaI night.

It was Wendy the concierge's fareweII bash
and a very good party if I say so myseIf.

Look, I know you don't have a cIue,
but the economy is not what it was.

Everything we've got, aII of it, couId go.

Faster than you can imagine.

We need this buiIt.

You're our cIoser
and you wiII heIp me cIose this deaI...

...or I wiII fire you
and take aII your stock options.

And I can't bear to see you Iike that,
George.

You wiII heIp me cIose this deaI, George,
won't you?

I'm surprised you have to ask.

I wasn't reaIIy asking.

-You shouId have gone with George.
-WeII, he asked June.

-Not excIusiveIy. He asked you too.
-He asked me too?

How many women shouId a man
take to dinner? Maybe in Utah.

-So you're gonna go aIone?
-Sure, why not?

Hey, I think it's great.

I was aIways too scared
to go anywhere aIone.

Then I got married.
Now I'II never be aIone again.

Check out this situation.
You two kids have fun.

AII right.

Howard. HeIen, how are you?

Mr. and Mrs. Wade, good evening.

-I hate these things.
-RidicuIous.

Why can't we just give the money
and be done with it?

Yes, that'd be fun.
Who wants a drink?

-I'd Iove some champagne.
-We don't want anything.

-I'II have a Scotch.
-Great.

I'II be right back
with one of the promotionaI bottIes.

-Wade.
-Trump.

-I hear KeIson finaIIy dumped you.
-Not exactIy, no.

We came to a mutuaI understanding that
she couIdn't bear me for another second.

So who's the new chief counseI?

If she's any good,
I'm gonna steaI her away.

I doubt it. She seems quite IoyaI to me.

-Let me be the judge of that.
-AII right.

I'm not intimidated.
I'II even Iead you to her.

She's over there somewhere.

Good evening.

Good evening.

WeII, you Iook-- I--

I-- You--

-I can't wait to hear your speech.
-Yeah.

No, it's just you Iook absoIuteIy...

...surprising.

WeII, you haven't seen
the whoIe outfit yet.

You see, ordinariIy that wouId suit you
extremeIy weII, but....

WeII, tonight you're--

I'm just....

-Lucy, hey.
-Hi.

-Wow. I Iove your dress.
-Thank you.

-And you Iook very beautifuI.
-No.

-I'm sorry, was I interrupting something?
-No, no. We were just...

...going over my speech.

Right. Work, work, work.

Howard wants me to revise
the IsIand Towers proposaI...

...now that we're tearing down
the community center.

-I couId reaIIy use your heIp with that.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

George, can I pIease taIk to you
for a second?

Hang on. They're about to shoot a man
out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream.

George.

I don't care about Howard.

No community center. I see. Okay.

We do give miIIions to charities.

So that justifies Iying.

Since when is heIping peopIe
and teIIing the truth mutuaIIy excIusive?

-You promised me.
-Oh, here we go.

You said you needed me to teII you
when you were being a schmuck.

It's frankIy none of your business, is it?
You don't work here anymore!

I cannot beIieve you won't even try
to be the person you couId be.

-This is the person I couId be.
-No.

You think you're second-rate
and there's nothing you can do.

And I never beIieved it untiI right now.
This minute.

This is the first time in a year
that I reaIIy don't Iike you.

I haven't Iiked me for Ionger than that.
And I'm not crazy about you right now.

Why don't you go and be the person
you're supposed to be.

Oh, good. I see the mature part
of the evening has begun.

Oh, buzz off, bozo.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the ice cream is ready.

Here comes the topping.

George, thanks again.
This was a spectacuIar evening.

I can't wait to teII my famiIy who I met.

Why? Who did you meet?

You.

-What?
-The eIevator.

-Evening.
-Evening.

-How's your room, by the way?
-Amazing.

-But I want to pay you back with interest.
-Don't be ridicuIous. I don't need interest.

WeII, this is me.

So good night.

Yeah, good night.

-I had a wonderfuI time.
-Good. I'm very gIad about that.

So good night.

Yes, good night.

It's aII right. I own the hoteI.
Your breakfast is compIimentary.

Gorgeous.

I know it's weird Iiving in a hoteI
but it somehow has a very homey feeI.

WouId you Iike something
from the minibar?

Maybe a beer.

Right.

Wow, chess. I Iove chess.

You know what I Iove
even more than chess?

Pokémon?

Strip chess.

Yes, that is a very good game.

George?
We need to finish this conversation pIease--

-Lucy.
-Oh, June. Hi.

-Lucy, hi.
-Wow. Wow. Great sIip.

-That's a great dress.
-Oh, you know, same one as before.

AII right. Break's over.
I'm gonna capture your bish--

-Hi.
-Hi.

We were just pIaying a IittIe chess.

And doing some Iaundry.

Oh, weII, that's okay.

'Cause I was just about to go off
and have some sex myseIf.

I mean, not by myseIf...

...but with somebody. Somebody eIse.

Oh, you don't know him.
He's in my apartment.

Yeah, in my bed.

His name is Barry. Yeah.

Barry in my bed. Okay, bye.

That was embarrassing.

-Hey.
-Hey.

-What's wrong?
-Thanks for your shoes.

HoId on, Iady. Look at me.
What happened?

-Nothing.
-Something happened.

I've known you since Brownies,
I've never seen you cry.

Except when Bush won.

Which Bush?

-Both of them. So maybe you cried twice.
-This is a different George.

I'm sorry.

It's not supposed to be Iike this.

Maybe it is.

Maybe it's Iike the phiIosopher
Sri Yogananda says:

''OnIy that which is the other,
gives us fuIIy unto ourseIves.''

Look. I had to fight for Tom.
It was the best thing I ever did.

ReaIIy?

Everything okay?

-Not now. Everything is not about you!
-Okay.

Quiet, everyone. Quiet down, pIease.

Thank you.

I have a IittIe poem I wrote for you, Lucy.
If you couId just come up here.

PIease.

-You ready for this?
-Rhyme away.

A rolling stone gathers no moss

So

You're leaving
With your antacids and floss

Our hair perhaps we will toss
But we are at a loss

Because you are the world's best boss

WeII, that was a very nice speech
you just made...

...and I'm going to reaIIy miss everyone
here at Wade.

There are a miIIion memories
I wouIdn't trade...

...and if you ever get accused of murder,
you can find me at LegaI Aid.

-What was that?
-WeII, it was the same thing you just did.

Bye. Bye. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Nice--

-Bye.
-Bye.

I'II reaIIy miss
aII your comprehensive reports.

Me too. Me too.

Lucy. Thank you so much for everything.

No probIem.
WeII, good Iuck with everything.

And I'm sorry about Iast night.
That was awkward.

-Oh, not at aII. Brian was unbeIievabIe.
-I thought it was Barry.

WeII, Barry was first, and then
it was Brian, and it was just crowded.

-I aImost forgot my stapIer.
-Is that--? Oh, God.

-What?
-Never mind.

-No, no. What?
-WeII, it's just that technicaIIy...

-...the stapIer beIongs to the company.
-That's right.

But-- No, you know what? Whatever.

It's-- The stapIer just goes way back
with me. And I--

WeII, no, no. You keep it.
It'II be our IittIe secret.

-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

Great, thank you. Thank you very much.

I guess I have kind of earned it...

...working here 1 8 hours a day,
seven days a week.

Wow. Guess that makes you a workahoIic.

No, actuaIIy, those are the hours
when you work with George.

WeII, no. I mean,
I can be a workahoIic too.

That's why I'm vigiIant about separating
my personaI and professionaI Iife.

ReaIIy? WeII, I guess that wouId expIain
the Iate-night meeting in your sIip.

-I'm sorry?
-What?

That is absoIuteIy none of your business.

My God. Fine.
How much does a stapIer run?

Here, here's $ 1 0.

-RidicuIous.
-It's not your stapIer.

What's the matter with you?
Give me my stapIer.

Look. You didn't pay for it.

-Give me-- You have more of these!
-It's not your-- Oh, my God.

-No. No.
-AII we're missing is the mud.

AII right. Enough. Enough. Leave.

-She's hurting me!
-Leave, Ieave. Off, off.

In here.

You are dead!

-What was that?
-Your girIfriend wouIdn't give me my stapIer.

-Part of a new office suppIy strip search.
-Your stapIer?

Are you stiII knocking down
the community center?

Listen.

-I know you're upset about Iast night.
-StiII knocking down the community center?

-I've been trying to caII you--
-StiII knocking down the community center?

What is wrong with you? Are you
incapabIe of taIking about your own Iife?

StiII knocking down
the community center?

AII right. Let me remind you.
You came to the hoteI.

I was with June.
We were unusuaIIy dressed.

You must-- You must have some feeIings.

I don't have to Iisten to this.

You know what, where do you come off?

Where do you come off? BeIieve it or not,
I didn't take this job to sIeep with you.

-I took this job for a cause.
-You are a cause!

You make Gandhi
Iook Iike a used-car saIesman.

My God. You know what I can't beIieve?
How easy you are being on yourseIf.

Why don't we go over this again, okay?
You promised me a community center.

Yes! I promised, I promised, I promised.
I'm sorry.

I can't controI the economy.
I can't controI my brother.

-I think you'II find a Iot of peopIe are!
-I'm human!

None of us can keep up with you.
That's probabIy why...

...aII those other guys boIted.

'Cause you're intoIerabIe!

No one wants to Iive with a saint.
Saints are boring.

Mr. Wade, your brother wants to see you.

Right.

Hi, Mr. Wong?

Yes, Lucy KeIson.
Yeah, it's been a Iong time, huh?

I'm back at my parents' house.

It's kind of fun being in my oId bedroom
and in the neighb--

Sorry. Can I have two number sixes...

...and a number, a number 1 2?

Yes, that's for one.

AIways for one.

Yes. That's it. No.
You know what...

...just throw in a coupIe egg roIIs
and that wouId be great.

For years, Coney IsIand has been
trying to attract this kind of deveIopment.

HopefuIIy, IsIand Towers
is the start of big things to come.

And now, it is my honor
to introduce to you...

...one of the men who made this
aII possibIe, George Wade.

-You Iook great.
-Go and earn your money, George.

-Thanks so much.
-Great.

Thank you very much, AssembIyman Perez.

Your mom is teaching today...

...so we'd better grab a bite to eat
and be on our way.

We have some protesting to do
at the community center.

I'm not going.

-What are you taIking about?
-I cannot watch...

...another buiIding get knocked down.

Hey. We didn't raise you
to sit on the sideIines.

Ever since you were a IittIe girI,
you fought for what you beIieved in.

You were on the White House
Enemies Iist at 5.

Dad, I'm not sitting on the sideIines.
I'm going to work.

What's the point?
The man's not gonna Iisten to me.

Besides, you know, he said
some things to me that were just so....

True.

Then you change your tactics,
you change your argument.

You don't give up.

We didn't give up on civiI rights
or equaIity for women or fair housing.

Honey.

As Iong as peopIe can change,
the worId can change.

Yeah, but what if peopIe can't change?

WeII...

...Iet me put it this way.

I'm sitting here eating a piece
of cheesecake made entireIy of soy.

And I hate it.

But I'm eating it.

I'm going to work. Bye. Good Iuck.

The Iaw is pretty cIear on this.

If the IandIord has not kept up
proper maintenance, he cannot evict you.

We wiII heIp you, Mrs. MuÑez.

Let me run and get you some forms
that you can fiII out, and we'II get started.

WeII, heIIo.

-Hi.
-You don't remember me, do you?

PoIIy St. CIair? You interviewed me?
You thought I was having a baby?

Oh, yes. Yes, PoIIy. Wow.

So you work here now.

-Terrific. How are you?
-Pregnant.

-I'm not faIIing for that one again.
-No, I'm reaIIy pregnant.

-You can congratuIate me now.
-PoIIy, I was not born yesterday.

I'm pregnant!
You want to see the damn sonogram?

Mrs. MuÑez, we have two other cases--

Hi.

Hi. I'm busy.

Yes.

I need your advice on one Iast thing...

...and then I promise
you wiII never hear from me again.

I just deIivered the first speech written
entireIy by myseIf since we met...

...and I think I may have bIown it,
so I wanted to ask your thoughts.

Okay. Then I wiII read it to you.

''I'd Iike to weIcome everyone
on this speciaI day.

IsIand Towers wiII bring prestige
to the neighborhood...

...and become part
of BrookIyn's renaissance.

And we're very pIeased
and proud to be here.

UnfortunateIy,
there is one fIy in the ointment.

You see, I gave my word to someone...

...that we wouIdn't knock down
this buiIding behind me.

NormaIIy, and those who know me
or were married to me can attest to this...

...my word wouIdn't mean very much.
So why does it this time?

WeII, partIy because this buiIding
is an architecturaI gem...

...and deserves to be Iandmarked.

PartIy because peopIe do need a pIace
to do senior's water baIIet and CPR.

PreferabIy not together.

But mainIy because this person,
despite being unusuaIIy stubborn...

...and unwiIIing to compromise
and a very poor dresser, is....

She's...

...rather Iike the buiIding
she Ioves so much.

A IittIe rough around the edges,
but when you Iook cIoseIy...

...absoIuteIy beautifuI.

And the onIy one of her kind.

And even though I've said crueI things
and driven her away...

...she's become the voice in my head.

And I can't seem to drown her out.

And I don't want to drown her out.

So we are going to keep
the community center.

Because I gave my word to her...

...and because we gave our word
to the community.''

And I didn't sIeep with June.

That's not in the speech, that's just me
Ietting you know that important fact.

What do you think?

I have to get back to work.

Right.

Right, yes, yes, yes. Sorry to disturb.

CongratuIations again, PoIIy.

Aside from the spIit infinitive
that was somewhere in the middIe...

...that speech was actuaIIy quite perfect,
wasn't it?

Yeah. I don't know what the heII
you're stiII doing sitting here.

And I don't even Iike him.

George!

George, I just want to say thank you.

Thank you and I know
I can be harsh and demanding...

...but I want to try and change
because I beIieve peopIe can change.

I can change and not be so demanding
and, you know, Iike, meet you haIfway.

I just-- I know-- Things just--

Once I--

Lucy...

...I am in Iove with you.

And I'm in Iove with you.

Oh, I shouId just mention
that I have resigned...

-...and am now poor.
-Good.

When I say poor, I mean we may have to
share a heIicopter with another famiIy.

Does that work for you?

As Iong as I don't have to work for you,
we wiII be fine.

ExceIIent.

And now I wouId very much Iike
to discuss that whoIe bobcat-pretzeI thing.

Oh, I was just kidding.
I'm aIIergic to bobcats, actuaIIy.

I'm very sorry to hear that.

-But I can do the pretzeI.
-That's exceIIent news.

Hi, Mr. Wong, it's Lucy KeIson.

I need one number 1 3,
two number sevens--

I can't beIieve how smaII this apartment is.
It's shocking.

I need three number eights, no garIic.

It's good your parents went to the movies.
We'd never have squeezed in.

I need one number seven and--

I can waIk from one side of this apartment
to the other in six seconds.

-Watch this. One....
-And a number 1 1 , pIease.

No, actuaIIy this is for two.
