Although? You can not go!

I still have a lot of things to do...

... But Peter can not thank you
enough to end this strike.

These unionists me crazy.

I really admire that has
working late to put an end.

The Tribune would have sunk without their lawyers.

It was a pleasure, Hall.

Well, if there is anything we can
do for you please let me know.

You bet. Pleasure to review it.

Peter! Finally meet you.

Congratulations on your party.

I want to introduce you to someone.

Hello!
Hello!

Enjoying the party?
Yes, thank you for the invitation.

Now Alan works with
Hall at The Tribune.

I am an intern.

And Hall said that Ime is
a very talented writer.

Well .. Send me when you're done.

I will gladly read it.

Thank you.

Listen. Gotta go. Have a nice day.

Why not stay here until
everyone has gone.

We can discuss your future.

I have to bring home Hall
and I still have things to do.

It's simple...

In any case the party will
even get it later.

I do not think I can.

No, I insist.

Ok, thanks

Ok, Ok! Why not see
if your boyfriend back?

Merv!

This is my roommate Michael,

which gives the impression of being who he really is

Wonderful!

Mervin, not disgust me

It is usually gentle, but is a
little rude when you are drinking

or eating or talking.

He was the first friend I made
when I arrived one year ago

By the way, I'm Tommy.
Alan.

Who do you know here?

I met Peter at
Tribune Los Angeles

In the classifieds?

No, he negotiated the end

He invited me to come back at night.

So you're a writer?

Yes.

You write what?

I'm writing my first book.

What is it?
Ironically,

homosexuality
throughout the ages.

Homosexuality has only
two ages: young, 29 years

I work for change
the negative image of gays.

Michael is my biggest challenge.

Know, I would like to
interview him someday.

This is something new.

Come on.

I gotta go.

See ya.

Hello
Can I talk to Tommy?

Yes, who is?
Alan Oakley, last night.

Oh, hi!
I wonder if you want to have dinner with me?

Of course! What time?

Hi, you should be Tommy?

Alan told me both of you!
Come in, please.

For me?

How beautiful!

Who are you?

Beverly.

Tommy, Hello!

Sorry.

About time!

This is rare.
He met Beverly.

Give presentations.

Alan told me that you are gay.

Beverly!

Just because there's nothing good on TV.

I find it so intriguing!

Not always. Liberace, for example.

Liberace was gay?

Certainly, yes.

Give it to me, thanks.
I'll look at the dinner.

Why do not we met a little better.

How was growing up in San Francisco?

I'm from Texas.

You do Valle?

You're so good!

I'm confused.

Oh, I know honey. Probably you
had a very domineering mother.

So, who planned to menu
tonight? A menage a trois?

Oh, no...

Alan hates French food.

You are unreal!

What was that?

I said... you're a lion.

I must be honest, I do not know many
gay...

Giorgio... except, my hairdresser.
He's so good!

You do your hair?

Not as many people. I myself do.

I loved it!
Thanks.

Oh, and Maurice, my
interior decorator.

You know him?

A fair color?

It's him!

Let's connect...

I'll bring my candles, my bells

This is great...

Are getting acquainted?

Yes, I'm getting to know her.

Before you know it will
a guru around.

I hope...

Huh?

She is a...

Shandi awaits us.

Honey, dinner's ready.

So what you are, relatives?

No.

He is my lover.

He is not a dream?

I need to smoke a weed!

This looks good!

You do not smoke weed, Beverly.

No, we do not smoke but the smoke gods

American Indians smoke.

which brings us closer to our deep...

... Unconsciousness.

And Shandi approve.
You're so good!

No, do not smoke marijuana.

Come on, is like smoking a cigarette.

I do not smoke cigarettes.

Honestly Alan,
you are a slave to reality.

Come on, no big deal...

if you are worried
with his political career

When he decided he wanted to be a writer? "

It has always been my dream since a child.

When he realized the
first time that he was gay?

Well, it has always been my dream since childhood.

Since I was a girl...

His family knows he is working
for gay rights?

They see me as a militant but
know it's something that I believe

and are behind me

The only one who was always behind me
was the boot of my father

"Work, marry,
between the army. "

"Visit exciting places, meet
interesting people and then kill them! "

There is nothing worse than a military father.

once, he was 13, held a
and it accidentally fired.

Killed Patton.

Patton?

Our parrot.

I'll never forget his last words...

"Patton wants a caixãol"

I always remember the way he shook
every time I approach a weapon.

I hear him scream...

Baby you never told me that!

Where are you originally?
Seguin, Texas.

Why come to Los Angeles and change
people's views about gays?

It is as if Texas did not need
more than Los Angeles.

It is bringing people together
in one place.

but they just want to meet
the men's room of the library.

I also spent much time
men's bathroom in the library.

When he had his first encounter gay?

8th grade, January 12, 1968,

at 15:45. a Friday.

This is very accurate.

I was very precise.

Is something going on here.

This is a romantic encounter or what?

I thought he was.

What?

He's kidding, honey.

No. I think not.

Now I understand why not
I wanted to here the principle

Because this is for my book

I'm going home to pray for you, Alan.

Beverly, wait!

I forgot to say something:
'Cocksucker! "

This was an insult?

You're so cool!

Sorry, it was not my intention...
Not so good.

I met her a few months

and thought it was normal?

what was that place?

I'm Republican.

You're kidding, right?

Yes I am. Not much fun, is it?

Anyway not much care.

He worked hard on it. I do not understand
a refusal to accept so easily!

am I missing something?

Can I read now?

Just wanted to forget it.

Ok!

This will cheer you.

Not my type of reading.

Reading? I know what is new with this.

So why not teach me anything.

Lesson 1...

No. Stop!

I do.

Coming!
Not yet!

Come on Alan, do not let your mother waiting!

I hear noises around. Open the door boy!

Good morning

Excuse me.

Larry, are you doing here?

I'm trying to find two weeks ago.
I have good news

After the recent events in
Florida, decided to publish his book

I have nothing to do with this book. That was a long
time and I do not believe that anymore.

Certainly not want my
name associated with something.

Alan, commenting is a big mistake.
No. It was a pleasure to see you.

What a change! You're popular.

Most are friends of Tommy.

Thanks for doing this again for us

It is a pleasure. Oh, before I forget...

These are the house keys...
Thanks for taking care of her.

No problem. What can I do for you.

Where's the incendiary bomb

Who knows? Signing autographs
and kisses, I think...

Looks like you guys to give
well after 4 years.

It is easy to live without others in our house

Interesting, no?

When we drastically change our
life, just the influence of a person.

What do you mean?

What should be driving to The
Tribune now. I would not be happy...

Excuse me...

How is he?

Do not make jokes. Close
eyes and turn around.

Do not look.

Happy birthday.

This is an "A". You missed.
No. They are our initials!

I know. Thank you. I loved it.

One more thing...

A photo of an Oldsmobile.

Too pretentious for a Volkswagen?

It is also his and arrives next week.

Are you kidding?

It's yours!

We can not afford.
We can, I saved.

I can not accept.

Have no choice! Already
paid and no refund.

See, it's for us two.

No.

Yes.

No.
Yes!

So it's easier.

Any idea how much I love you?

No, but you can show me.

How could you do this to me?

Alan, signed a contract with me
4 years ago. This is perfectly legal.

The timing was very good practical
let go and not put your name.

What is the complaint of having a best
seller, a young boy?

Hear that "The citizens of Dade County,
in Florida, voted by a margin of 2-1...

to refuse an amendment in the law that prohibits
discrimination against homosexuals.

"Before that, the singer Anita Bryant
made a public campaign

against the bill to the nation.

After his statement, Bryant said:

"God help us, we will reject
These laws across the nation. "

This book of shit "The truth straight"
and Anita Bryant will be a big problem.

I do not know, I meet David Metzner
tonight to discuss how to control damage.

See you there.

Why not told you the truth?

say wrote the book number
1 of hatred in the nation? Can not make it.

I suppose all this will calm and
nobody will know it was you.

but do not think it's better to be honest?

It would be easier to take the books
the shelves!

Have to face it, Alan.

That's right.

Just talk. He will understand.

I hope so. Thank you.

"TRUTH HETERO" WHO IS THE TRUE AUTHOR? The battle for gay rights in
Florida has made "The truth straight" a best seller, but the author remains a mystery

Where is it?

Here.

I do not want luck?

I need to tell you something.

What?

What is it?

Devastate them.

Thank you, see you tonight.

Bryant's move to end
equal rights for gays in Florida...

... Extended nationally.

We are here with Tommy Ballenger, "High and Strong"
a group fighting to avoid...

... That this cross-Bryant
come to California.

Mr Ballenger,

What The 'Tall and Strong "flaps do to avoid
that this crusade is to extend nationwide

"I think the best thing to do
is to teach all about diversity.

Teem People fear what they do not understand.

Have you read the book "The straight truth"?

It was obviously written by a
Christian aiming to harm us.

Why do you think was published anonymously?

Some words to quit?

Yes, thanks.

I wanted to do according to un
Anita Bryant's friends:

If you stop telling lies about us,
stop telling the truth about you

Rushed an incident during an interview
with reporters. And this is what happened

Our crusade
against homosexuals

Could start on June 8
After our great victory.

But we wanted to avoid
and win it in Virginia

We talked to Norfolk
with protesters

and face all sorts of problems e. ..

Security.

Hurt?
No. At least it was fruit cake.

Yes, I would like to give the name
the author of "The Straight Truth"...

I wanted to stay anonymous.

Mr. Ballenger, it was revealed that the
author of "The straight truth is Alan Oakley,

Who lives with you for four years.

Any comments?

This was a plan to make money
the controversy with Anita Bryant?

Or a plan to attract supporters?

Tell the truth honestly:
Alan Oakley is your lover?

Listen. Farrah Fawcett made in his
thighs. If you do not go away

I'll stick this microphone so deep...

Oh! Her hair is awful, baby!

Cut!

No newspaper in the country, except
will want to gossip

maintaining a journalist who writes
against the rights of others

Not supposed to be published.

A real journalist would never write
something that could not be published!

A true writer should
be responsible for your words!

Until his father agrees with that.

You have created...

an atmosphere of anarchy around.

We have protests outside the building!

The phones are congested
death threats!

I have no choice but to let you go.

Anything you want me to say?

Sorry.

"Stop the attacks on gays!"

"One reason for revolting!"

"Cancer on the gay community"

"Alliance of People with AIDS"

"Fighting for Our Lives"

Excuse me...

Excuse me...

Honey, in a minute you meet.

"Out loud," I can help you...

Yes, Mr. Oakley
will speak during dinner.

No, he is single but I am.

No, I'm not a lesbian!

Well, since my friend and I...

You know, I can see two guys doing...

because they have nowhere to hold.

But two women?

Oh my God. There is a lesbian, is it?

No.

I can only conjure up a department for me.

The Department of Defense.

He is the one of our programs

which will increase its budget heading

Better close your mouth and open it
when it is correct.

It is the only president ever
giving bad news to the American people.

It is a Republican. What do you expect.

With the Germans
We do not talk of war.

If I remember correctly
you were one of those Republicans.

If I remember you'd be a prostitute!

I love your outfit.

It's as Crystal Carrington ":

but you yank your eyes!

Thank you. their clothes are so stunning.

Oh, this? My style prostitute?

people who are alive.

Righteous man who was looking for!

Only if it is heterosexual, I know!
What are you doing here?

It will not work.

Come on!

You did the right thing with the gay community,

He hates me.

Is that you hate yourself.

I can not.
I have to write my speech

something for my birthday

He is sick, Alan.

Michael asked me who told you

He goes in his parents' house after

No, I can not.

Gotta go home.

Home to what?

My parents arrive tomorrow!

His parents come tomorrow?

Yes, you have to change their stuff

I'll buy a new one.

Stop essse present, ok?

I'm perfectly happy with my car.

Alan is a Honda,
how can you be happy with that?

We are not so well.

Are you kidding? Could not be better!

The firm has not lost any process...
I'm talking about us, Peter!

We are far away.

Takes you to the Cape once you have some time.

He should have left him long ago.

Sometimes he could only stand

Nobody here is interested.

Lower your voice!

We are not deaf.

At least it could be of interest
on the welfare of my son!

Respect the interests of all Alan,

This is the first time I hear you
My son complained of forcing you to swallow anything?

I have to put up with it.
