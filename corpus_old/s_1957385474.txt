I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

Your love be with me

[faint slapping]

[ominous music]

[faint thud]

[loud thuds]


[ghostly winds]


[loud screaming]

[ominous music]

[loud clanking]

[faint beeping]

Thank you for calling
male phone sex hotline.

This is, Kanye.

Shawn?

Hey, that's your lunch.

Well that was your lunch.

So what did you get?

Alright I think
I found something.

Like what?

I think I found
a haunted doll.

What?!

Alright, where is she?

Let's go, ill show you.

Okay.

So the lady I talked
to today said she called

a paranormal group to come
out and cleanse her house.

But it didn't work so
they just took the doll,

and now it's being held here

at U.S.A Paranormal
Haunted Museum.

Okay.

Alright so,

so we gotta break her out.

Either that or ask
her to give her over

nicely for a few days.

Okay, plan.

Okay.

I'm gonna go watch a whole bunch

of break out of jail movies.

You do some actual work

and figure out what
we're gonna do.

Yeah I've already
got all that.

No way.

We have a scheduled meeting
with them in 15 minutes.

What?!

[imitates explosion]

Let's go.
Let's do this!

stop being gay.

This is a spider gremlin.

A spider gremlin!

At least that's
what we call it,

because it can latch on to
anyone that makes eye contact

for too long and
reveal their deepest,

darkest secrets and fears.

Like a gremlin!

Shawn.

I'm just saying,
I've seen the movie.

No, but like a demon.

So why don't you just
call it a demon, right?

'Cause he called it a gremlin.

Exactly.

Thank you, thank you.

Someone sides with me.

Right this way gentlemen.

Hey, its your mom.

And here we have
my grandmother.

Ooh!

And when she died we stole
her from the nursing home

and brought her here.

And...


This is Susan.

[ominous music]

And story has it that she can
pull the soul of anyone that

comes into physical contact
with her, directly into hell.

Larry, not to
disagree with you

but I think the
doll's name is Anna.

No this is Susan.

Susanna, my mistake.

You do see the card says Anna?

Yes I see it, shut up Shawn.

Alright I'm just being.

So Larry any uh chance
that any artifact

could maybe leave this place?

You can do any
investigations you want

with anything in here, but
I cant let anything out.

I'm sorry, I cant risk them
getting out into the public.

Even if it is in the hands
of experienced Parators."

Parator?

Oh, he put Paranormal
Investigator together, okay.

So there's not a
single way that...

No.

Anyone could take
anything from...

No.

From this place to do a
little further investigation?

I wish, my hands are tied.

Under no circumstances?

Nothing at all.

No circumstances?

Nothing at all.

What about us two?

I'm sorry I wish I
could help you gentlemen.

Alright, I got this.

Larry, mind showing
me your gift shop

my friends here's
gonna use the bathroom.

The restroom's not...

Oh oh don't worry about him,

he'll find a corner
or something.

What's that?

Oh this is from an ancient
rail station accident.

Rail station?

Mmm hmm.

They say that when you're
in the presence of a demon,

or any creature that collects
souls for that matter,

you'll smell a foul smell in
the air almost like sulfur.

Like from the
railroad way station?

Mmm hmm, yeah.

And you can actually feel

the creature absorbing
your happiness

and feeding negativity
back into ya.

This story in particular
has everything.

Mirror posses, mirror
visions possessions.

It was a night unlike tonight

when there was a fire in an,

when there was a
fire in an orphanage

and everything was destroyed.

The table that she was
sitting on was burned.

She...

I couldn't find your toilet,

but I did find a
nice little cranny

where there was a
whole bunch of books.

They're very absorbent."

Those are rare!

Ow.

evening friends.

This is your host to welcome you

through the creeping
door into the other side.

For another gamble of...


[loud spring]

[rock music]

[ominous music]

[suspenseful music]

me get a focus on you.

Okay.

got, alright perfect.

Action, go!

Alright, what we're
setting up right now

is what we like to call Seven
Days with a Haunted Doll.

It's a, it's a working title.

But before we start,

boom, for our Youtube viewers,

we're gonna take a shot.


I'm not good with
alcohol but, that's good.

Alright, so what we're
doing is we're filming

this in a haunted location,
supposedly haunted.

Alright so, let me show
you where she's at.

This is Anna's bedroom.

That's Anna.

As you can tell,
that's her crib.

Now Jake tucks her in.

Go ahead.

Show everybody.

I'm putting the EMF detector
on either sides of the crib

with the KEMF.


Laser grid.

So that way we can even
get even measurements

on any other-worldly phenomenon
that may be occurring.

Alright, so we're gonna
have laser grids, PK meters.

Lets see, we're gonna
have EMF detectors,

ouija boards, anything
and everything

to measure the paranormal realm.

We're setting up the greatest
investigation known to man.

So, let's begin.

Day one.


Alright you wanna do the...

Yeah, yeah.

We're still rolling yeah.

Alright let's go the...

So let's begin.

Day one.

Alright hold on.

Day one.

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah.

[ominous music]

[loud creaking]

[loud creaking]

Now we just observe.

[rock music]

â™ª She comes across
all Cheyenne red â™ª

â™ª This is glowing blue â™ª

â™ª Tempting you with
all her bones of hell â™ª

â™ª And has your thumbs on screws â™ª

â™ª Raise the levy of
your violent hour â™ª

â™ª I feel way down through â™ª

â™ª By your ticket for
this one way ride â™ª

â™ª This one you got is true â™ª

â™ª One by one we'll
be queueing up â™ª

â™ª To get a glimpse of you â™ª

â™ª She models life with
her unbreakable strife â™ª

â™ª She'll leave you born anew â™ª

â™ª Raise the levy

â™ª I feel you way down through â™ª

â™ª Buy your ticket

â™ª 'Cause what you got is true â™ª

â™ª Save me baby from â™ª

Found something weird.

It looks like the
side of her cheek

is holding some sort of heat.

Well maybe she's blushing.

Try giving her a little
peck on the cheek.

Just a little muah.

[faint creaking]

Okay so I found a few things.

Alright so, apparently

all of the victims are...

Woah woah woah,

are you saying the
victims are not victims.

Wait, are you
saying that air quotes

are some kind of sarcastic?

Course is it.

Wait and everyone knows this?

It's common knowledge.

Huh.

There's a lot of
people in my life

that are really confused by now.

"Shawn, what were you saying?

Oh.

Alright so mainly all of the,

all of the victims are women.

Mainly or all?

What do you mean?

Were all the victims
female or weren't they?

You say mainly
which means maybe,

yes is a definitive answer.

So was it a maybe
or was it a yes?

Yes.

Yes.

We really need to work
on your communication.

We need to work
on your attitude.

So what your saying
is we need girls.

Yeah.

Where are we gonna
find one of those?

I don't think a personal
add on the internet

was the best solution Shawn.


It's better than you
sitting around a mall

using your whole green
eggs and ham line.

Are you kidding me?

That's a great line Shawn.

Oh no, I don't
doubt the method,

just the man.

Are you two Jake Smack-my-bottom,
and Shawn McGreedy?

Oh no, Shawn.

Oh.


Kat.

Oh wait, like the animal?

Kat, it's great
to finally meet you.

Nice to meet you too
Mr. Smack-my-bottom.

You can just call me Jake.

It's cool.

I've meet so many
people with odd names

that it doesn't even
phase me anymore.

Well isn't that nice?

Oh, yeah, ha ha.

So you read the ad.

Do you have any concerns
about it first off?

All the ad said was that
you need a girl ya know,

to spend a few
days at some place,

experience some weird things.

Well that's very descriptive.

So we are going
to do some things

that are a bit out
of the ordinary.

I'm fine with weird things.

That doesn't bother me.

But, if it's going to be
more than just you two

then I'm going to
have to draw the line.

I did that once, wasn't
a good week after.

Oh.

Yeah it's just us two and,

you don't mind us filming right?

I'm fine with that.

You can do whatever
you want, really.

How do you feel about dolls?

I'm fine with them.

They can be a bit
creepy at times but,

I can fit just about
anything you want.

Depends on how big
the doll is but,

then again I'll
try anything once.

I'm lost.

So are you into the
paranormal at all?

I was a fortune
teller for a fair once.

Oh highly qualified!

Well you little miss are hired.

We want to start tonight
if that works for you.

I could do tonight, that
wouldn't be a problem.

You two got my number?

Oh yeah right here.

Well, just text me the address

and the time, I'll be there.

Awesome!

Thank you so much.

Oh before I forget,

you two got plenty
of protection right?

Protection?

Protection?

Yeah, protection.

Oh wait, guns?

Knives?

Oh no we watch plenty
of martial arts movies.

My body is a weapon!


See you tonight.

What are you thinking?!

Run?

She's crazy.

Hi.

I'm here about the ad.

uncles place sucks.

Yeah he had a lot of Prada
projects before he passed.

the heat wasn't one of them.

Yeah.

Oh.

It's got me, it's got me.

Yep yep yep.

Ah, it sucks.

Hey Shawn.

Yea?

Why did you tell that girl
my name was Smack-my-bottom?

No no no, I said
Smack-my-tottum.

Okay so,

so I get that and
you get McGreedy?

I mean, I mean it's
fine if you want

to be Kurt Russel
from The Thing.

Oh yeah, that's
what it was from.

Totally didn't make
the connection.

Sure you didn't.

Did we grab anything
to feed her?

To feed her?

What do you mean?

Are you serious?

We don't have
anything to feed her?

You cant invite a woman
over to your house...

To a haunted house
with a haunted doll

and two strangers, yeah.

Yeah and not give her food!

And what does she eat
oh grand seuth sayer

of estrogen throne?

Slayer of clouds and freer
of the house of Willie?

We need a veggie plate.

Veggie plate?

Yes a veggie plate.

A woman feels comfortable
when there's a plate

for her to eat on of
delicious vegetables!

Where do you get?

How do you get your information?

Where would we even buy that?!

And she's coming in like
three minutes anyways.

Shawn.

Yeah?

No one is getting through
that door until we have a plate

of delicious vegetables
for them to eat.

I mean it.

Alright.

Okay I'll send her a text,

tell her if we're
not back in time

to just go around
back, come right in.

Good.

Alright?

Yep, and you're driving.

Don't hand me...

Fine.


[ominous music]

[loud thuds]

[ominous music]

Boy it's foggy in here.

Aw candles isn't that
just a sweet touch.

Ya know, these guys
are something else.


This better be worth it.

Why is it so cold?

There's a light.

[loud thuds]

[ominous music]

Sorry, I don't do girl on girl.


[loud thuds]

[loud scraping]

[loud thud]
[high pitched siren]

[dramatic music]

[loud thud]


[heavy breathing]
[ominous music]

[high pitch siren]

[low rumbling]

[loud screaming]

No, I don't know
why you always make it

more difficult
than it should be.

You really do.

Next time, give her your number.

She was mentally handicap
bagging our groceries Shawn.

What do you mean she was
winking at you the entire time.

I'm sure that was
apart of her handicap,

she blinked all the time.

Well she only
had blinks for you.

[faint dispatch]

Hey, I wonder what happened.

Diarrhea, indigestion,
mesothelioma,

they are all killers.

Your just listing off
commercials you've seen.

That's where I get
all of my knowledge.

Ooh it's cold!

She'll love this.

Oh!

So whose wasting
electricity now?

You were the last
one out of the house.

I did that on purpose.

It was intentional.

I guess she
didn't show up yet.


Shame.

[loud creaking]

You know, I'm
kinda glad she didn't

because I kinda got
a feeling that girl

was a bit of a freak.

She seemed to turn
everything we said sexual.

I bet she was trying
to hit on both of us.



Yeah?

I think a beaver or
something's getting in.

Could be a possum.

Beaver?

Really?

That's your first animal for
trying to get into the house?

Aw Anna, that mean
old possum scare you?

Opossum.

That's what I said, opossum.

No.

O.

There's an O in front
of possum, opossum."

Do you have to argue
with me in front of Anna?

Wait at least until
she's out of the room.

Aw Anna, tomorrow
we're gonna meet

a satanic lady whose
gonna see if your actually

full of demons and stuff.

And this guy right
there might have a date,

because she's kinda cute.

If I can overlook the fact

that she's working
with witchcraft.

[faint creaking]

No, no I don't
think I can Shawn.

Oh yeah?

Or we'll just sit here and
eat our vegetable tray.

at this over here!

It's like a real one.


underneath the street,

we're under the street.


Spiderweb.

Let's get that web,
let's get that web.

It's like moms house right now.



Ready? Let me get a focus.





Okay so we're here.

We're following some
kind of creepy vamp kid

through something.

We are completely
underground right now.

I'm not sure where we are.

Notice, look at all this.

Okay.

So we're about to see
the satanic ritual

momentarily.

can keep rolling.

Are you ready for this?


Come this way.

She's preparing.


Your place is spider-webbed.

Hmm?

Clem

Clem.

You're name's Clem?

That's a little weird.

Okay so, one question.

Why is there a naked
bloody chick on the floor?"

Her name is Princess Jasmine.

Don't.

I'm so gonna.


He's got the eyes for you.

Shhhh.

Hi there.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I was just
preparing my soul

for the darkness that awaits.

what you were doing?

The ritual, yes.

The ritual requires you to

succumb to all earthly elements,

and be one with the dirt.

And you had to
wear the goat skull?

The goat, yes.

The goat represents
the bond that we have

with the unholy father.

So is that why
you used the blood?

Yeah, how else do you
think I got the goat skull?

Like, are you two sure that
you're ready to be doing this?

This isn't some sort of
internet joke video right?

Of course...

Not!

It's not.

Don't say anything.

Everything that we're doing
is completely [stutters]

legit and is for us
to truly experience

our friend who is in the doll.

You see, what my friend's
trying to say here is,

we wanna see this bitch.

Well boys, don't worry
your pretty little heads.

We will see this

bitch.

So...

Shhhh!

May I see the doll?

Yes, yes you may.

But you see we

left the doll in the car.

Because we didn't want
to just bring her in.

You left her in the car?

I told you to bring her in.

I didn't want to impose.

You need to bring her in when
I tell you to bring her in.

You know what,
you need to stop...

I am sorry.

I left the window cracked okay!

Alright, alright.

I will be right back.

I'm gonna go get her.

This way right?

Yeah.

I'll stay and
do some research.

[ominous music]

Here we go.

Alright,

now, both of you have to
show me that you are clean.

Oh don't worry,

I washed.

No.

Meaning both of you cannot
be wearing any clothing.

Wait, I'm sorry, what?

Like shirts and pants.

Everything.

Socks?

Mmhm.

I'm not doing that Jake.

Well, if you don't,

neither one of you
can be down here

to take part in the ritual.

Alright let's go home.

Pack it up.

Get the doll.
Come on.

that suggested we do this.

Yeah, suggested!

I'm telling you right now,

you talk me out of
things all the time.

I bet you if she was 300 pounds,

hairy, and named Patrick,

you'd be singing a
different tune right now.

Okay well she's not.

She's a babe.

Oh yeah, you're
gonna think that one.

Her name is princess Jasmine.

How does that help me?

Hey I'm gonna do this!

Go ahead.

Okay.

Go ahead.

Well...

You can run out and
you can be "that guy".

Or you can suck it up and
you can get naked with me

and a strange lady.

You know, when
you put it that way

it kinda sounds like fun.

Hey, it's like a dare.

Go for it.

Something I've
never done before.

I'm not doing that Jake!

I'm not gonna get
naked with you!

I'm not gonna get naked with her

and especially that doll!

I hate you.

We're about to witness
a real-life ghost.

We're editing this
part out of the show.

Show?

Show.

Oh a show, show.

We were not showing ourselves.

showing ourselves.

But your not showing yourself

He said show he
didn't mean the show

the way you thought
he meant show.


that's what we said.

I haven't started
the ritual yet.

And being in control,

I choose to show myself
spiritually instead of physically.

Well that explains everything.

Sure.

Okay, everybody
close your eyes.

[ghostly winds]

Is everybody's
eyes still closed?

Yes.

The spirits seem
a bit aggressive.

[speaks foreign language]

[ghostly winds]

[low rumbling]

[ghostly breathing]

[ominous music]

[faint scream]

[whimsical music]

She's here now.

She's in the room.

She's not revealing
herself to me just yet.

Bring her in Jasmine.

Bring her in.

She's angry for some reason.

She's here.

[loud thud]

Willy Wonka ghost!

[ghostly winds]


[ominous music]

I didn't play baseball.

I missed.

Okay okay, alright.

[loud scream]

[ghostly wind]

Can we at least
put on some pants?

Find her, kill her.

Shawn?

Don't ask me.

Ask her.

No I mean when we find her

how are we supposed to kill her?

I don't know.

Why are you asking
me these questions?

You never ask me
these questions."

Shawn...

Yeah?

Footprints.

[ominous music]

Well alright.

Let's get going.


[loud rumbling]

Okay, we're good.

Any possessed girls
wanting to talk?

Yea I call thee possessed girls.

Come out, come out
wherever you are.


Shawn.

[loud screaming]


Nope.

On the count of three.

One, two, three.

[loud growling]

[loud grunting]

[ominous music]
[loud clanking]

Okay.

Are we saying that

came from that?

I don't give a damn.

I'm just gonna kill the bitch.

Hey Jake.

Yeah?

Can I talk to you
alone for a minute?

Okay.

No, alone.

Alone, alone.

[faint creaking]

Yeah.

[ominous music]

You should be asking me
why I would stick around.

well start clapping

and I'll make my way to you.

[loud claps]

[loud growl]

Shawn?

Shawn I'm stuck over here!

Hey come to me!

Ugh.

[low rumbling]



Oh god, okay.


[ominous music]

[faint screaming]

[faint growling]


[loud sobbing]

[rumbling chatter]

[dramatic music]

[ominous music]

[dramatic music]

[fast paced music]


[loud screaming]
[dramatic music]


Shawn.

Shawn?

Shawn?

Shawn!

[suspenseful music]


Shawn?

Yeah.

What happened?

Where were you?

I hid in the bathroom.

You didn't hear all
that happened to me?

Would you feel
better if I said no?

[ghostly wind]

[loud growling]

[loud screaming]

[loud coughing]

[faint humming]
[ominous music]

Find her

You want us to find you girls.

Release Jacob

and we'll find you girls.

[loud growling]

[loud thud]

Is it over?

I did something bad.

[rhythmic thuds]


Jake.

I got a plan.

Why don't we just run?

Oh yeah, let's say
that a bit louder!

Like I planned that last
night when I said it.

You think I really want
to go hunt down girls

for that stupid doll for a
Little Shop of Horrors scenario?

How are we gonna leave?

What we do is we play it cool.

Alright?

We just act like we're
gonna go get the goods

and then just run like hell.

Convert everything.

Hell, I'll do
Scientology if I have to.

Scientology?

I'm desperate Jake.

Hail Xenu.

It's already happening.

Okay.

You ready?

Yeah.

[loud yawn]

Look at that
Shawn we are awake.

Let us go and get
us some females

and sacrifice them to the doll.

You're right!

That is something I have
wanted to do for so long.

Who doesn't like
starting out their day

with a good sacrifice?


Yeah!

I guess we'll be off to
go and get those girls now.

Oh yes!

Mmm mm mmm good!

[ominous music]

[fast paced music]

This way!

Come on!

[loud yell]


We're leaving.

That's what we're gonna do.

What are we really gonna do!?

I don't know.

You said you'd give it girls.

We.

What?!

We made a deal with it.

You're included.

Okay, we will get a girl.

That's what you told it?!

We have to do something.

Do something?!

We go!

Others have!

Those were haunts.

You made a deal with it.

It's not some kind of
paranormal king pin Jake!

It's a fucking doll!

You know as much as I do.

We both don't know!

But,

you made a deal with it,

that's a commitment.

What that means to
it, I don't know.

Okay.

Alright, we just give up.

We tell it we can't do it.

It's a doll, we just
cant do what it asks.

I don't think it's that easy.

So what?

What do we do?

We need to kill her.

Well, exorcize or
whatever you call it.

So you've been taking
priestly classes behind my back?

Hey.

We need a professional.

Oh yeah, a professional
ghost expeller!

Woo, where are we gonna
find that, Craigslist?

Or a psychic.

Okay.

Where do we find one of those?

[ominous music]

It just sounds so stupid to me.

I cant believe that your
even suggesting that.

So you really want
the whole plan to be

where all we do
is say hey listen,

we were attacked by a
doll, people are dead.

I mean, whose gonna believe us?

She's gonna believe us
because of her psychic-ness?

It's the best we got.

Okay.

[upbeat music]

[slow paced music]

So, how may I help you?

Wait.

I'm sensing something.

You want something.

Alright, she's just
gonna pee wee out.

Shh, Shawn.

Yes we do.

Do you do like paranormal stuff?

Paranormal work?

Ghosts, demons,

I don't know possessed dolls.

I'm just throwing it all out.

Yeah, things like that.

Is this ghost
here with you now?

No, it's back at the house.

You're not sensing
its power are you?

Yes.

Yes I do.

Oh it's power is very strong.

How is it affecting you?

Bit me in the arm,
hurt my leg, threw him.

Plus it killed two people.

Allegedly.

We don't know they're dead yet.

Killed somebody, you said?

Allegedly.

Excuse me for one minute.

Please, make yourself at home.

Have a seat, I'll be right back.

Take your time.

Yes, I have two
guys here that are

talking about
murdering somebody.

think she's doing?

I don't know
maybe making us tea.

What do psychics don't
normally leave the room.

Yeah, I know that's
why I'm asking you.

I think she's
calling the police.

No, can you please
get here quickly?

[ominous music]

Dude she's calling the cops.

Well that's not good.

What are we supposed to do?

I don't know
this was your plan.

Okay, I mean I'll stall
them as long as I can.

Okay.

[loud thuds]

[loud screaming]

What are you doing Shawn?

called the cops!

I'm doing it!


No!


I'm sticking
with the damn plan.

You're not gonna
get away with this!

Hurry.

[loud crack]

[ominous music]

She's finally awake.

We're really sorry
about all this.

But, we're serious about
what is going on here.

We also need your
expert guidance.

Believe it or not,

we don't know how
to expel a ghost.

Well, not
professionally that is.

Can I remove the gag?

Careful.

Could be a trick.

How else do you expect
her to expel a ghost Shawn?

What are you talking about?

She's psychic.

With her mind.

[loud creaking]

Hey Shawn.


Do you remember those possession
movies where you had to

stab somebody so many times
and then light them on fire?

I'm gonna say yes to avoid
any arguments, but yeah why?

I don't know.

Just thinking of a back up plan.

Just in case.

Oh.

We would umm, I don't know
