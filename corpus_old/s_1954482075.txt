PREVIEW

Seven children, attending a children's camp,

were guided by mysterious
devices to File Island,

a place where Digital Monsters -
Digimon - lived.

But soon after their arrival, they were
attacked by a ferocious Digimon, Kuwagamon.

Just as they were
driven into a corner, the

tiny Digimon that were
following them evolved.

But, even though they thought
they had defeated Kuwagamon,

it came back, putting the children
in more grave danger...

Explosive Evolution! Greymon

Sora!

Koushiro!

Takeru!

Marching Fishes!

W-We're saved...

Hey, over there!

Faster!

Now we're finally out of danger.

What was the deal with those fishes?

Those were my Marching Fishes.

I'm able to control fish at will.

I see, so it was all thanks to you!
Thank you, Pukamon... I mean...

That is...

It's Gomamon.

Gomamon?

What happened to you, Tokomon?

I'm Patamon now.

We've evolved.

"Evolved?" What's that mean?

Normally, it's when
organisms in a species

change to adapt better
to their environment...

That's right! From that evolution,

I changed from Motimon into Tentomon.

I evolved from Pyocomon to Piyomon.

I evolved from Tsunomon to Gabumon.

I evolved from Tanemon to Palmon.

And I evolved from Koromon to Agumon.

In any case, you seem stronger than before.

Are you still a Digital Monster,
even after you've evolved?

Yup! I'm so glad to have met you, Taichi!

Huh? Why?

I haven't been able to evolve on my own.

I'm sure I was able to now
because I met you.

Then, is it the same for you, Piyomon?

Yes.

Could it be the same for everyone?

Yes it is!

It's all thanks to you, Mimi!

But I don't even know what I did...

Are you able to turn back?

Maybe not.

This still doesn't make much sense to me.

It doesn't make much sense to us either.

More importantly, what are we
going to do now?

Let's go back to where we came from!

We should wait for
the adults to come find us.

That's easier said than done...

We've been swept pretty far away...

It doesn't look easy going
back up that cliff either.

Then what should we do?

How about we look for a road somewhere...

More to the point, where are we?

It doesn't look like the camp site,
no matter where I look.

He's right. The vegetation looks
like they're from the subtropics.

It sure does!

Eh, you know what I'm talking about?

No.

There should be a road that
leads back up there.

Perhaps so. If we go back, we might be
able to find clues on why we're here.

But aren't there more monsters
like the one from before?

Yes, there are.

See?

I don't want to put anyone in danger...

Are there any other humans here?

Humans? Like you?

Yeah.

I've never seen any.
There's nothing but Digimon here.

Only Digimon? But you all
sure look different.

You said that... this is File Island, right?

Is it really an island?

I've never heard of it.

This place probably isn't in Japan...

Anyway, let's go.

There's no point standing around here.

Hey, where do you think you're going?

I saw the ocean awhile ago!

The ocean?

Yeah.

So let's go see it!

Should we go?

Yeah.

In times like these, it's best to stay put
and wait for the adults to save us.

That's also the reason why
we should go back to...

Jyou!

Hurry up!

Hey!

I've never seen trees like these...

I thought they were subtropical at first,
but it appears I was wrong.

Maybe this really isn't Japan...
they look really strange.

These Digital Monsters should have been
a big tip-off that this place is strange.

Digital Monster.. like, electronic monsters?

You can refer to us as Digimon.

You don't appear as electronical
as your name suggests.

What's that, electricity? How's this?

Hey, stop that!

Patamon, you were flying before, right?

Yeah, I can fly now. Look!

Cool!

But I think it's faster if you walked.

I'm much faster! Look!

There's no difference.

Palmon, you look kind of like a plant.

I am. I can even perform photosynthesis.

That's neat! Do it, do it!

Mimi, do you know what photosynthesis is?

Um, not really. What is it?

Well, I don't really know either...

You said there was nothing but
Digimon here, right?

Yeah.

So that means Kuwagamon was a Digimon?

Yeah.

If there was a big one like him around,
there might be others...

We've already said there
are only Digimon here.

I smell the ocean!

And I see it! It's the ocean!

Why is there a phone ringing
in a place like this?

What's wrong, Taichi?

It stopped.

I can't believe there
are phone booths here...

It's irrational!

But they do look like the phone
booths we normally see...

They're the same as the one
next to my house.

Which means...

We must still be in Japan!

Japan?

Jyou, what's that?

...Or maybe not.

Koushiro, lend me 10 cents.

What are you going to do?

Isn't it obvious? I'm calling home.

Oh, then you can use my phone card for that.

Ah, I'm calling Mom!

Me too!

Me too.

Hey, Takeru!

I'll try too.

Even Sora-kun is joining in...

Hello? It's me.

The time is now 35:82:90 AM.

Beep. Beep. Beep. BEEP!

Wha-... What the heck?

Tomorrow's weather will be sunny,
with occasional ice cream.

Huh? Did I dial the wrong number?

The number you dialed is no longer
in service. Calling again is pointless!

This is weird, Onii-chan.

I'll try calling my own house.

What's wrong with this phone?

How are things over here?

Doesn't look like it worked.

Currently, this phone is outside
of all service areas.

Well?

Nothing.

Thought so.

What is with these phones?

How about this?

The time is now 90:99:100 AM.

Beep. Beep. Beep. BEEP!

Next!

He's pretty persistent.

That's Jyou for ya.

No matter where we call, the only thing
we get is random information.

Let's give up and get a move on.

Wait a second.

Even if we can't call, there might be
someone who'll call us. Like the one earlier

It's a waste of time staying here.

It won't hurt to keep an eye out here.

Besides, everyone's tired!

We're all kind of hungry as well.

I guess.

We haven't had lunch yet.

All right, let's take a break!

Does anyone have anything to eat?
All I have is this...

Huh?

This is the thing that came
falling from the sky...

Oh yeah.

I've got one too.

Mine's on my bag.

I have one too.

Looks like everyone is holding one.

I wonder what these things are...

Anyway, we were talking about food,
weren't we?

All I have is a travel-size first-aid kit.

It has adhesive tape, disinfectant,
and some thread and needles.

I have this laptop, digital camera,
and a cell phone...

But since I've come here, none of them work.

I thought I still had some battery left...

You sure brought a lot of junk
to summer camp.

What about you, Taichi-san?

Oh, me?

Just this. A mini-telescope.

I didn't bring any food either.

I did.

See?

Candy! It looks so tasty!

But wait, you're not from our
school, are you?

Nope. Since it's summer vacation,
I came to visit my onii-chan.

Right, Onii-chan?

Y-Yeah...

He calls Yamato "Onii-chan."

Maybe they're cousins...

Mimi-chan, what did you bring?
Your bag looks pretty big.

Oh this? Well...

I have this solid fuel, a Swiss army knife,

A compass, a flashlight, and then...

You're pretty prepared for survival...

It's been a long time since I've gone to
camp, so I borrowed my dad's gear.

Secretly.

You don't normally bring this stuff though.

But they may turn out
to be useful to us now.

That's true... we don't know what
to expect from now on...

Yeah... you're right.

Anyway... looks like Jyou's still
making phone calls,

but there's no way he
could have brought food or...

What the?

He has the emergency food supply!

He does!

Hey, Jyou! You're carrying
the emergency rations!

Why do I have to carry that?!

But that bag...

Bag?

Oh yeah, I've been trying to hand
this over to Mimi-kun!

He's talking about you.

Me?

Mimi-kun, it was your turn to take
charge of the emergency rations.

You need to keep a better eye on it!

But it's so heavy!

Don't be so selfish!

Now, now!

It's great just knowing that
we have something to eat.

Now let's have some lunch!

Right!

Each group is given three
days worth of food.

Since our group had six people, 6x3x3 is...

54 meals.

Right!

So if we divide that up
evenly between 7 people...

Two and a half days.

R-Right...

But since we're sharing with the Digimon,
it'll be half that.

The food won't last for more than a day.

Oh yeah...

We're fine. We'll find food for ourselves.

You don't need to count us in.

Is that really okay?

Yeah, it is. It's what
we've always been doing.

That really helps us!

Okay then, this food will
be for the humans...

How is it? Taste good, Agumon?

Yeah!

<i>aid  it's only for the humans!</i>

Oh relax. Don't be stingy!

No!

What's wrong, Piyomon?

Something's coming.

Wh-What is it?

It's Shellmon!

Shellmon?

This area must be his territory!

Shell!

Shellmon. He is an aggressive
Adult Level Digimon.

Everyone, this way!

Jyou!!

Let's go, guys!

I'm counting on you, Agumon!

Baby Flame!

Petit Fiyaaa... huh?

Magical Fi-...

Huh?

Petit Thunder...

Ugh...

What's wrong?

Their attacks aren't working!

Agumon!

Damn it!

Air Sho...

Poison Ivy!

Huh...?

Baby Flame!

Looking good, Agumon!

How come only Agumon can fight?

I'm sorry... I'm so... hungry...

Gabumon...

I have no strength...

I get it! It's because Agumon ate earlier!

I see...

So does that mean the other Digimon
have no power to fight?

Agumon, we'll have to make do on our own!

Gotcha, Taichi!

Hey! Over here, Shellmon!

Taichi!

Baby Flame!

Take this!

You piece of...

Damn it!

Taichi!

Damn it!

At this rate, everyone will...

Isn't there anything we can do?!

Taichi!

Agumon!

Taichi!!

Wh-What's that?

Agumon, evolve!

Greymon!

He evolved again...

into Greymon?

You can do it, Greymon!

Mega Flame!

Agumon!

You changed back...

Are you okay, Agumon?

Taichi...

I'm hungry...

Hello? Hello?!

There's no reason for us to stay here now.

Yeah...

Eat as much as you want!

We haven't completely beaten Shellmon.

We should leave before he comes back
to assault us again.

That's true.

Then let's go back to that forest!

The forest that we turned up in.

Let's wait for help there!

Like I said before, we fell off a cliff
and went downstream.

We can't get back so easily.

No more Kuwagamon!

Since there were phones here,
there must be people who've put them there.

We should go look for them.

That's a good idea...

I agree with that plan.

All right! Let's do it!

I'll go wherever you go, Taichi!

Thanks, Agumon!

Then it's decided.

Yeah.

Make sure you don't leave
your stuff behind, everyone!

All right! Let's go!

And so, the seven children
and Digimon set off...

into an unknown world of adventure.

"I must protect my little brother
at all costs."

As these thoughts weigh over Yamato's head,
a vicious lake Digimon attacks him!

To save Takeru, Yamato tries
to sacrifices himself,

but then a huge wolf engulfed
in blue flames rushes to his rescue!
