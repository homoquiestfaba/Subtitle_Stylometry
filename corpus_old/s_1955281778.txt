Is this the decision?

It is.

Can you pay the price?

All of it.

The beast requires flesh
to become flesh.

Your blood
will be his price.

Revenge.

A worthy cause,
but at a great price.

No. Ha!

I need you more.

I need to come back
in style.

I need...

a posse.

Who will be

my new playthings?

A little piece
of behemoth.

[raspy breathing]

I dub thee Punchy.

I didn't want all this.
I wanted just one. You.

What? More than
you bargained for?

Consider it a bonus, bozo.

You, Gemini.

Freak Show.

Ahh, succubus.

Batty Boop.

I always wanted
a girlfriend.

What? Where did he go?

Who is to be my victim?

No. What's happening?

I guess we're going
home, schnookums. Oops!

I don't want to go.
I want to kill.

[clown screaming]

Okay, everybody,
listen up. Party's over.
Move out, come on.

Now, let's go.
People, move it.

See you later.

Be careful.

I am so sorry, Officer,
everything just
got out of hand.

And, um...

Do you live here?
No, but I'm house sitting
for my professor.

And he's out of town.

Okay, keep it
down, please.

Yes, Officer.
One warning, that's it.

Okay, thank you.

Good night.
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you.

Good job, baby.

God, what the hell?

Looks like your little
shindig got out of hand,
huh?

This has been
a fucking great party.

Best spring break ever, right?

If it wasn't
for the swine flu,

Whose idea was it
to invite half the campus?

I said only a few people.

You guys have got to
help me clean this place up

before the Professor
gets back.

Sandie, come on, you know?

You know we're gonna help
you clean up. I mean, look.

Whoa, Erica! Erica!

Let me just
get the bottles.
Sorry, okay.

I'll get the bottles.
You get the paper.

be okay. We'll help you
clean up this godforsaken.

OSHA-condemned
disaster zone up.

Stop trying
to make me feel better.

I caught these two
making out in the closet.

Get out.

Awww, that's so romantic.

Yeah, I think that's
romantic, too...

I do.
Zilla, you're so funny.

Dude, what's wrong
with you?

Look, man,
I just get nervous, all right?

Nervous?
You had the entire
night to talk to her.

I know,
but I'm kinda shy, man.

It takes me a while
to warm up to a girl.

You're on the Dean's List.
Girls line up for you, man.

I really like Erica.

Baby, baby, I gotta
get Zilla hooked up.

Zilla?
He's not a little boy.
He can do his own dirty work.

That's what I said,
but he really likes
your BFF.

He's been giving her
those puppy dog eyes
all night.

She didn't notice?

No, she responds
to audible speech
and other social cues.

Not smoke signals.

What the hell's
the matter with him?

He's shy, nervous.
He starts sweating,
fidgeting and stammering.

Hot flashes, cold flashes,
lukewarm flashes.

Then it's just
a total body meltdown.

Frankly, I think the reason
we call him Zilla

is because his breath's
a little stinky.

What the hell happened
in his childhood?

Why does he follow you
around like a puppy dog?

'Cause I'm
the quarterback, baby.
The man with the plan.

He takes care of me
on the gridiron.

And I take care of him
in the real world.
He looks up to me.

Well, he's in trouble.

So are you.

[both gasping]

Sorry, Zilla.

It's fine, Erica.

Are you sleeping
here tonight?

Absolutely, I am.

I think I have a shirt
you can sleep in.

Don't worry about it, Sandie.
I sleep in the nude.

Well, look at that.
It's past my bedtime.

I guess I should get going.

I'll see you guys later.
Later.

Bye, Zilla. Thanks for helping
me clean up. You saved my butt.

You're way
too serious, baby.

It was a mistake
to have the party here.

The Professor gets back
in three days.

This is the last of it.
I finished the bedrooms.

Any puke up there?

Just in the bathrooms.

Thank God for linoleum.

I know. By the way,
where are the mirrors?

What?
I didn't see any mirrors.
Where'd you put them?

Come to think of it

there weren't any mirrors
in the house.

That's odd.

Coffee.

The paper.

I'll get the paper.

That's nice, dear.

What the hell is that?

I have no idea.
I just found it outside.

Somebody obviously
left it for us.

Rojer, I don't live here.

Just a house sitter.

Maybe it's
for the Professor.

Does it have
a note attached?

No, nothing.

I have no idea.
Let's open it.

We can't.
It's probably not for us.

You can't open mail
that's not yours.
Don't you know that?

This isn't mail.
Just some bag.

We're not gonna know
what's inside of it
unless we open it up.

So what do you suggest?

Erica and Zilla
are gonna be here tonight.

Yeah, baby, they will.
What are you thinking?

Maybe it was left
for one of them.

So you want to wait
till later to open it?

Yeah. We'll find out
what's in the bag
later tonight.

All right.

What is it?
We don't know.

Looks like a painting.

Maybe someone has
a secret admirer.

Let's open it.

No, you guys, this could
be for the Professor.

I don't see
his name on it.

Yeah, baby, how long
are we gonna wait?

It's probably
something perishable.

Perishable?
Like fruit.

I'm just impressed he used
a word with more than
three syllables.

Okay, children.
Cut it out.

Okay, fine,
let's open it.

Let's see what
the hell's inside.

thought you needed a mirror.

Maybe they
thought the Professor
needed a mirror, Rojer.

It's beautiful.

So ornate.

It's probably an artifact,

Hey, Roj, check it out.
That's my favorite part here.

Don't worry, Sandie.
Nothing scary happens.
Just watch.

What about it?

[all gasp]


That's your
favorite part, man?

It's awesome, dudes!

Tomorrow night
the Professor's back.

Before back to the dorms.

One more night
to make a little trouble.

I'll drink to that.

Come on,
give me a picture, damn it!

[Batty Boop] Maybe you
need some bunny ears.

Yeah, well, Punchy
ate the last set.

And anyway,
aren't we digital yet?

Do you got the right
input selected?

I don't know.
I'm not an evil queen.

You're dressed like one.
Shut up!

Operation manual.

All right, fish breath,
come on, hand it over.

Here...

Chinese, I don't...

All right, fuck it.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

who's the baddest
motherfucking clown
of all?

I'm talking
about Killjoy.

[mirror rattles]


Killjoy.

Well, you know my name!

Seems you have me at a bit
of a disadvantage, big boy.

What the hell?

It's Killjoy.
You already said that!

Now who the fuck are you?

Well, whatever your
name is...
Zilla.

Zilla. [Laughing]

As in God?

Zilla.

You're scary.

Now what are you
gonna do about it, big boy?

I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass, homey.

[laughs ]

Not "homey." Killjoy.

But don't you think
it would be better

if you picked on someone
your own size, huh?

Oh, Punchy!

Ooph! [Chuckles]

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
And it looks like
it's fight time!

In this corner,
hailing from who
the fuck cares

is a fucking dude named
after a Japanese monster.

But in this corner,
the unstoppable force,

the Babylonian behemoth.

Put your hands
in the air for Punchy,

the hobo clown!

All right,
come here you.
Come here you.

All right, I want
a nice clean fight.

Kinda like a I need
another asshole
in my other armpit.

Right?
[makes farting sounds]

No fish hooking,
no hitting below the belt.

No rabbit punching.

Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

Time to fight,
fight, fight, fight
fight, fight, fight, fight.

Oh!

[bell rings]

Back to your corner,
back to your corner.

Okay, okay.

Okay. [Groans]

That was great, kid.
You almost got this one.
I swear to God.

You just gotta stick
a move, stick a move,
all right?

Come on, come on.

Here, right here,
have a drink. No, wait!

You're supposed
to spit in this one.
Spit! Oh, yeah!

You got this.
Remember your namesake
Zilla, right?

Stick a move.
Work the body.

Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

Up, up, up, go!
Come on.


What the hell are you?

He's the unstoppable force!



No! Come on, Rojer.

[Zilla panting]

Hey, Zilla!

Zilla! Hey!

Hey, what...

No!
What's wrong?

No!

Help!

Sandie, get my phone.
It's on the table.


Hey, buddy.

My friend,
he's having a seizure.

Really?

He's getting the shit
beat out of him.

Send a fucking ambulance!

Okay, here it comes.

What the fuck!

Come on, buddy.
Hey, how are you?
Hey. Zilla.

He's coming to.

[laughs, stammers]

What? No.

Where the fuck did he go?

You should have
finished him off.

Uh-oh... [gibberish]


I hate it
when they get away!

Don't worry, baby.

They ain't going nowhere.

Nowhere but here.

We got him.
He's coming to.

Hey, bud, we got you.

Let's get him up.
Let's get him up.
I got you, come on.

Come on, get up.
Gotcha, bro. Here we go.

Here we go.
On the couch.

I can't beat him.
I can't beat him.
There you go.

He's a huge...
he's a huge...
Zilla, what happened?

Unstoppable force.
You all right, bud?

Big fucking boxing gloves.

What are you on?
Hey, Zilla, doesn't use
drugs, okay?

Big bodies.
It could be something else.

You all right, buddy?
Hey!

I don't know.
Zilla, what happened?

I don't know.
It was like a...

It was like a dream.

A really bad dream.

I saw Killjoy.
Killjoy.
No fucking way.

Who's Killjoy?
No one. Just a hallucination.

No.
What's with the ambulance?
Where's the phone?

The phones are dead.
What do you mean dead?
I thought you got through.

I don't think so.
The operator was...

Was what?
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

I'm gonna get the car.
I'm gonna be right back.

Take Zilla
to the hospital myself.

What the fuck?

What?

What's the problem?
I don't know.
I can't get out!

Something's blocking
the fucking door.

What?
Get back.

Next time, we've got
to get every bit
of him through.

I know, schnookums.

Don't worry.

He'll be back.
As long as he looks
in the mirror.

They'll all look.
They can't help it.

Why can't I just go
in there and kill them?
Booya!

Because if they die
in there,

we don't get to collect
their souls.

They've got to come to me.


That clown was just
beating the hell out of me.

Then you guys pulled me
out of it.

You mean we woke you up.

No, I wasn't sleeping.

You pulled me out of it.

Zilla,
you were unconscious.

Then let him rest.

It's a little hard
to believe this shit.

Our phones
don't fucking work,

and we're trapped
inside this house, okay?

But something weird
is happening.

Come on, Sandie.
As you said,
let's let him rest.

All right, let's try
to get him up to one
of the beds

and then try and find
a way out of here.

Hey, Zilla, buddy,
come on. Here we go.

There we go. Come on,
Sandie, you lead him.
Okay.

I'll be up in a second.

I'm gonna
clean up the blood.

All right.

Thataway, buddy,
thataway. Good job.

Good job.

Oh, my God.

You flatter me.

You can't be real.

Really?

What do you think
happened to your friend?

You think he cut
himself shaving?

Or fell down the stairs?

You're a demon
of vengeance.

What do you want
with us?

Who would want
vengeance on us?

Who indeed?

Vengeance is mine.

But I'm innocent.

Innocent?

Oh, yes, you must
be joking. [Laughs]

[gas hisses]


Innocent.

That may be true.

You see, you're not really
the one that I want.


Your ass is mine!

You guys believe me,
right?

What do you mean?

That I saw him,
saw Killjoy.

Zilla, I think it's better
if you just get some rest.

Yeah, lay back.
We gotta figure out
what's going on here.

Then we're gonna deal
with it.

All right?
Just chill. Just relax.

What's going on?
What's going on?

Huh?
He's...

He's real.
Demon from hell.

Who?

He feeds for revenge.

Ten years ago.

What are you
talking about?

A decade ago
he was summoned.

Killed the boy
who summoned him.

He gets joy from death.

Guys...

stay away
from the mirror.


[no audible dialogue]

Erica.

Erica.

Erica, is that you?


What the fuck was that?

No, Zilla, stay down.
I'm fine, Sandie.

What the hell happened
to you, man?

I don't fucking know.

Thought I saw someone.
Who? Who'd you see?

I don't know. It was weird.

I turned around.
No one was there.

Maybe it was Erica.
It wasn't fucking Erica.

Where is Erica?

I don't know.
You guys haven't seen her?

No.

Erica.

Erica.

Erica?

Erica.

Erica.

Erica?

Sandie, don't touch it.

I think that's her.

Sounds like she's
in the mirror.

Erica.

Hello, kiddies.

Ahhh!

Doesn't she look delicious?

Holy shit,
fucking Killjoy.

You're damn right
it's Killjoy.

That's him, I guess.

That's him, I guess.

What have you done
with Erica?

Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

I'll get to her
in a minute.

What do you want?

A feast, if you will.

So you're just going to
let us all enjoy

this scrumptious meal

by ourselves? Are you?

Oh! Oh!

She smells delectable!

You better get away
from her or I'll...
You'll what?

When you decide
to join me,

you know where
the door is.

Do you think
they'll come?

They'll come.

But where is he,
our guest of honor?

[Batty Boop] Not to worry,
my painted prince.

Hi.

Cheer up.
Your friends will come.

And we'll all have a bite.


Puppy meat,
yum yum now?

Hold on there, tubby.

You'll have your chance.
Keep basting.


Where's the salt?

You're not seriously
suggesting...
You have a better idea?

You don't know what
we're up against.
I have a pretty good idea.

I'm gonna arm myself
any way I can. I suggest
you do the same,

especially if we're
gonna go after Erica.

Okay,
I guess you're right.

So we're going in.

We are going in, right?

Yes, we're going in,

but, Zilla,
you don't have to go.

I may be beat up,
but I'm bigger than
both of you put together.

You're gonna
need me in there.
Here it is.

I see your point.

All right,
what else repels demons?

Zilla, what do you think?

How the fuck
should I know? I'm not
a comic book character.

You were in there.
You had the most
contact with him.

They're the ones that
had all the contact,
with my face.

Easy, guys.
We have to think here.
What kills a demon?

What can we use
against them?

All right, maybe we oughta
slow down and think this
a little bit further.

Change up our strategy
a little bit.

What do you mean?
He's a clown, right?

Why are we afraid
of clowns?

'Cause they're fucking
stupid. How's this
gonna help us?

A lot of little kids
are afraid of clowns.

Yeah, why is that?
Where you going with this?

Because they do
horrible things
to each other,

and we're supposed
to laugh.

I'm not laughing
at Killjoy.

I get it.
That's the point.

What is?
Exactly.

He's a clown.

Maybe we're supposed
to laugh.

What's the hell's
going on here?

Professor.

What are you kids doing?
The door's stuck.

We're trapped.
Trapped?

Sir, you wouldn't believe us
even if we told you.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
It's already begun.

What's begun?
You know what's
going on, don't you?

Did a package arrive here?
You know about this?

When did package arrive
and how did it come?

We didn't know
what it was.
How did it come?

It was in a bag
on the porch.

You took it
out of the bag?

Yeah, Zilla already got
the living shit beat out
of him, okay?

And Erica's stuck
in there, in the
fucking mirror.

With him.

Killjoy.
Yeah.

Killjoy. We gotta go
in there and get her.

No, no, no.
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

Excellent, excellent.

His soul
is the most crucial.

Baby, what's so
important about him?

He is the fool
who conjured me.

It's his blood
that fed my resurrection.

And it's got to be his
blood that completes me.

Pumpkin, then why are we
waing our time

with these dumb kids?

Bat, you floozy!

We've got to get
that old man in here.
He's got to come to us.

Besides, they just rot
when you kill them out there.

Sorry, Mr. Crabbycakes.
Yikes!

I still don't get why you
care so much about this one.

Because this one
stiffed me.

This one owes me a victim.

You cannot just summon
a demon of vengeance

and not have a victim
to sacrifice.

I need sacrifice!

I need blood.

if I got this right.

His name isn't even
Killjoy?

Not his real name,
not the original one.

How do we kill
this thing and
get out of here?

And that's my job,
and your job is to
get your friend back.

This is the research
that I've been doing
on this demon.

As you can see, Killjoy's
a relatively new name,

but he's existed
in the canon since
ancient times.

So why does he keep
coming back?

People conjure him
for vengeance.

Just to wreak havoc
and revenge.

I get it.
What does he want with you?

Well, we have
a disagreement.

You gotta
be kidding me.

That's not important.
Do you wanna get
your friend back?

Or don't you?

Yeah, we do.
What's the plan?

We created demons.
We created religion.

We created the books
that gave them life.

We feed them
with our thoughts,
our prayers

but we're also the ones

that wrote the book.
What does that mean?

It means that if we
understand the demon,

we can control it.

And I can make it
feel pain.

So tell us what to do.

What I'm going to do
is call Killjoy

by his true name,
his original name,

and then that will
give me power over him.

And then with the knowledge

that I've gained
from these ancient pages,

I'll be able to banish him.
Why don't you tell us
his real name now?

It must be
in his presence.

All you have to do is
get your friend back
through the mirror,

and I'll handle the rest.
You sure you can take care
of him on your own?

I've been doing research
on this demon for years.

I'll deal with it.

Okay,
when do we go in?

You getting
cold feet now?

Cold feet?

Young man,

We're about to
come face-to-face

with a pure expression
of evil.

If you're not afraid,
you will be.

Come on, come on,
what's taking them so long?

Perhaps I should give
them some incentive, eh?

Come on out! Come on!

What the hell was that?
Shit, man,
I got a bad feeling about this.

No shit.

What's the holdup?

Dinner is ready and waiting.

If you don't come,

Guess that was
the dinner bell.

Ready, guys?
How could it wait?

Let's get it over with.

I'll go first.

Booya!

Hello, pretty boy.


Am I supposed to be here?

Sure you are.
Where else would you be?

On a rescue mission,
I think.

Finally, someone
to take me away
from all this.

Really?
Save me!

Hey, I got a girlfriend.

What? How dare you make
lewd and lascivious advances

on me when you
got a girlfriend.
Think of her.

I am. I am.

You are what?

You're one of those
crazy psycho-bitches,
aren't you?

I think that's
the sweetest thing

anyone's ever told me.


Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we talk?

Remember,
just get your friend.

Leave Killjoy to me.

Okay.

What the fuck!

Hey, baby,

where have you been
all this time?

I've been a good girl.

Really?

Have you?
Yes.

Where's Erica?
What, you mean dinner?

The main course.

Where's Rojer and Zilla?

Those two pathetic clowns
are being well taken care of.

Don't worry about them.

You fucking bastard,
you better not hurt
my friends or I'll...

Or what?

People keep saying that

and I want to know what.

Let me guess.
You're going to
call me names.

No. Well, then,

maybe you're going to
laugh at me.

Do you find me funny,
huh? No?

Watch this.

Didn't you think
that was funny?
No.

Well, then
you gotta dance.

What?
Dance!

Dance.

Get this through
your pretty little head,

when you say "or what,".

Or what?

You'll never see
your friends again.

We'll have just
a quickie, you know?

In and that's it.

Don't you mean in
and out?

I got teeth everywhere,
honey.

There's no out.

Shit!

Your girlfriend won't know.

She will if my dick's
bitten off.
Really?

Don't you got a boyfriend?

What a dreamboat.

Killjoy.

If you're cheating on him,
he'll cheat on you.

He wouldn't do that.

How do you know?

You see, Punchy,

what I'm getting at
is social equality

is not just
a textbook concept.

It's a reality,
and not just back on earth.

There is no reason why
you can't demand justice,

why you can't
demand equality,

some roll-on deodorant.
And it all starts with you.

The higher-ups aren't
gonna do a damn thing
about it.

They just sit on your shoulders
while you do the brunt
of the work.

What the hell gives Killjoy
the right to push you around?


Come again.
Bunnies.

Bunnies.

Now dance!

Why fight it?

What's that?

Why fight it?

I'm already trapped here.

You're not so bad.
I take offense at that.

I mean...

You're kinda sexy.

Hell, you're hot.

You noticed. Yeah,
I work out a little bit.

It's not all
balloon puppets,

creamy maggot pies
and juggling, you know?

See that?

It would appear
that you're trying
to make a deal with me.

Look,

I know who's boss
around here.

I can get used to this.

I'm not a fool.

But I can be one

for you.

So you want to bargain
for your life?

What could you
possibly offer me?

I could offer you
something that you've
never had before.

And what would that be?

Consensual sex.

And...

I'm a virgin.


Thank you, evil one.

Here's something...
I'm gonna take...

I've never had
consensual sex before.

I'm sorry.
Follow my lead.

Okay.


Nothing.

I thought you said
you were a virgin.

I watch a lot of porn.

Take me. I'm yours.

Okay.

Oh. Hey, baby,
what are you doing here?

I see you're playing

with your food.

This? This is not
what it looks like.

Okay, chowder breath.
What's it look like?

She was coming on
to me.

Are you actually
telling the truth?

Yes, yes.

Ow!

Damn it, Batty!
What the hell!

Am I supposed
to believe that?

Yes, mm-hmm.

Besides, you get
to play with your food.

Weren't you just getting
your rocks off with
her boyfriend?

What?
[Batty and Killjoy] Shut up!

I'm a succubus.

That's my job.
What's your excuse?


I'm Killjoy.

I don't need no
stinkin' excuse!


Let vengeance be mine.

Power to the people,
Punchy.

Power to the people!
Power to the puppies!


What's that?
Yum yum now.

Oh, God.

Welcome all to my feast.

The feast of souls.
The feast of fools.

Well, what are you
waiting for? Dig in!

But before we get
to the main course...

You, Professor,

tried to cheat me.

What?

What is he talking about?

A mistake for which you
and your friends will pay!

It was not a mistake.

What are you talking about?

No?

Enlighten me.

You are a foul aberration,

A sick stench
in the human mind.

You lure desperate people
into your trap.

You prey on the weak,
promising them strength,

and then you take
everything they have.

Do I know you?

You will.

Kinda makes me hungry.

Say it.

Say it now.

Say what?

Dinner time!

No!

No!


Aah!

Why aren't you doing anything?

Ah, you...

Aah!


Hah! Ha ha!

Come on.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

No!
Ha ha ha!


Ooh.

Punchy!

You fat blundering idiot!

Destroy him!

Punchy,

now remember
what we talked about.

There is no reason
you have to take
this abuse from him.

"Aboose"?

He has to take
whatever abuse I give him!

Punchy, listen to me.
These are nothing but rules.

He doesn't have
any real control over you.

Me crush you.

No, Punchy, no!
I am the boss!

Raah!


What the hell are you doing?
Why don't you say his name?

Yaah!

He already killed
Rojer and Erica!

Uhhn!

Hah!

Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha!

There's the mirror.

Aah!

No one's going anywhere!

It's time for dessert!

The only way you're getting
out of here is inside of me!

Feardarig!

Feardarig!

That is your true name.

I have many names!

And this book
contains them all!

Red Cap!

Loki! Manthu!

I command you!

I control you!

I am the father
of one of your victims...

One of the people
that called you
from the depths,

You tricked me.

You used these kids
to distract me, to weaken me,

To exact your plan
of revenge. Ha ha ha!

What?

Professor, is that true?

Careful.
When hunting monsters,

you may become one yourself.

I know what I am!

You sold us out!

I'm doing what has to be done!

It's so devious.

I'm proud of you.

I was the object
of your revenge.

I was the one!

Imagine that. Ow!

All this time it was me.

Shut up!

Why...

here's the part
you don't want to hear.

The fatal flaw
in your little plan!

You see, you're right.


I am a part of you... aah...

And you are all a part of me!

I said shut up!

Aah!

Your son is a part of me!

How will you avenge him?

[Young man's voice, echoing]
Good to finally meet you, Dad.

No.

It's me... Michael.

The son you never met.

Michael?

That can't be you.

Dad, we all become Killjoy.

When we call on him
for vengeance,

we become part of him.

Soon you'll join us.

Dad, soon we'll be together.

I have power over you.

Is my name in the book?

Does it say Michael in there?

You see,
we create these demons.

Welcome to the family.

Fucker!


What the fuck?

He's a clown. Laugh.

He's a clown. Laugh.


What are you laughing at?

Hoo!

Aah!

[barking, growling]

Gotcha!


Stop that!

I still have
the Professor's soul.

I can live.

Feardarig!

Your name is Feardarig!


No.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

No!

No!

Oh, no.



She hasn't stopped
laughing yet.

And what about
her friends?

The police are still
trying to get her

to say where she
dumped the bodies.

We can help her.

We can
stop the laughing.
