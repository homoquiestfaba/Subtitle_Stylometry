NARRATOR: Since the
beginning of time,

Man has created a netherworld
of legend, myth, and folklore.

Today, men still scour the
earth for answers as a quest

For the truth continues.

For some, exploring
the unexplained

Affords the unique
challenge of seeking

Out that which is unknown.

One of the most disturbing
and compelling legends

Is that of a strange creature
that many claimed to have seen

Or had close encounters with.

This animal was,
until just recently,

Thought to be nothing
more than folklore.

Coinciding with
this assumption was

Most of the
scientific community,

Who dismissed the
reported sightings

And attacks as fueled
by the superstitions

Of the Latin American culture.

What is this animal
that has caused so

Much debate among scientists?

And so much fear among
the people of Puerto

Rico, Mexico, Texas,
and several other parts

Of the United States?

None other than the Chupacabra.

Literally translated
from Spanish,

It means one who sucks
blood from goats.

Beginning in the spring
of 1994, the Chupacabra

Began to attack goats
and other livestock

On this side of the border.

South Texas was the
first to be hit by a wave

Of these vicious events.

By the summer of 1996, called
Verano del Mal by the locals,

Or the evil summer, the
attacks had escalated

In number and violence.

Now horses, family pets, and
even humans were also being

Attacked by the Chupacabra.

Although the attacks were
witnessed by several people

And several photographs
were taken of the aftermath

Of a Chupacabra attack,
they were repeatedly labeled

As nothing more than a hoax.

That was until January 1997.

The videotape you are watching
is actual surveillance camera

Footage taken on a cold evening
on a Santa Maria, Texas farm.

This footage became one of
the key components that capped

An intensive
investigation that led

To the death of several people.

This is the true story using
actual video footage shot

By a group of intrepid
students from the University

Of the Rio Grande Valley.

These students set
out on a mission

To track down the
elusive creature.

The team which is headed by
cryptozoology student, Maria

Esperanza, directed their quest
to the small rural community

Of Santa Maria in
southern Texas,

The site of the most frequent
and recent Chupacabra events.

Along with Esperanza were fellow
students Pete Cortez and Daniel

Webster, both of whom
volunteered to document

The events as they happen.

The group also decided
to enlist the help

Of George "Army" Armistad.

Armistad was a former
Marine, personal bodyguard,

And a renowned firearms expert.

Once the team was complete, they
embarked on the daunting task

At hand.

This case, however, has a
deep, personal significance

For Esperanza.

MARIA ESPERANZA: It
was about a year ago

When my uncle first told me
about livestock mutilations.

He said that someone...
Or something...

Was attacking his goats
and other livestock

Almost every night.

He said these things were
occurring closer and closer

To his home, so he was afraid.

I was too.

I suggested that he notify
the local authorities.

And I set up some camera
surveillance equipment.

I saw what was on those tapes.

That thing, that creature,
that killed my uncle,

It is not human.

They found him in the
woods a week later.

NARRATOR: Now, for
the first time ever,

The legendary Chupacabra had
been documented on videotape,

Proving its existence
and catapulting

It into the world of academia.

There were many questions
to be answered... among them,

What was this creature?

And where did it come from?

Some very credible
people believe

That the Chupacabra
was a secret government

Genetic experiment gone wrong.

The US government admits to
having a biomedical laboratory

And Puerto Rico, but will
not divulge any information

About the range of tests
that are conducted there,

Stating it as classified.

Others believe
that the Chupacabra

Is something much worse.

They believe that
the creature is

A pariah, a true symbol of
evil that exists in our world.

Still others believe
that the creature's

Not even of this earth.

Many different people with
many different beliefs.

However, the
Esperanza expedition

Set out to find the truth.

Here is their story.

A series of brutal
animal mutilations,

And other strange occurrences,
has brought the University

Of Rio Grande Valley
School of cryptozoology

To the Texas border
of Mexico... this time

To my hometown, Santa Maria,
Texas, population 800.

For the past several nights this
town has been gripped by fear.

It's being terrorized by
these animal mutilations.

And the carnage has everyone
locking their doors at night,

Including this man,
Mr. Lloyd Jackson,

Owner and chief
operator of Jackson

Cattleman Livestock Company.

Good morning, Mr. Jackson.

Good morning, Miss Esperanza.

I see you've brought a good
portion of Texas militia

With you.

But we travel light.

So Mr. Jackson, you...
You had an animal

Mutilation on you property?

LLOYD JACKSON: Yes, ma'am, it
happened some time last night.

Just as the reports have
said over the last few weeks,

This is no ordinary mutilation.

This is goat has been
disfigured and violated

By a twisted mind of a creature
with supernatural strength.

I would have
cleaned this mess up

By now, what with
it getting so ripe,

But I was waiting on you all.

And the superstitious
farmhands wouldn't

Let me until some kind of
Hispanic holy woman comes and...

MARIA ESPERANZA: Curandera?

Well, whatever... blesses
the goats or something.

MARIA ESPERANZA: This goat
looks like it's intestines

Have been sucked right out.

FARMHAND: No touch it, senorita.

No.

Mr. Jackson, let's go inside.

Excuse, do not go inside.

This is the work of a
Chupacabra... el Diablo.

Hold on there, Victor.

Please, do not touch that
evil flesh unless blessed

By the Curandera.

[Speaking spanish]

Ranch hand is saying that
the holy woman has arrived.

And he seems to be
asking her for help.

Buena dias, Senora.

Como esta Usted?

[Music playing]

[Speaking spanish]

She's asking the holy one
cleanse this evil ground.

[Speaking spanish]

Please destroy this evil demon
who plants these evil seeds.

[Speaking spanish]

She's telling the spirit
to leave this place.

[Speaking spanish]

Answer me.

Why are you here?

I want to learn
about the Chupacabra.

I will not speak of this.

MARIA ESPERANZA: Will
you help us, please.

The answers you seek you
shall find in La Cantina.

La Cantina?

Why the cantina?

No.

No.

[Goats bleating]

[Speaking spanish]

Well, I had 87 till last night.

I got 86.

You've got company.

How you all doing today?

I had a report there's
been some livestock

Found dead out here someplace.

It's dead except for the goat
got its guts sucked out of him.

Sheriff, Maria Esperanza,
University of the Rio Grande

Valley School of Cryptozoology.

Crypt... crypto what?

Cryptozoology.

Pardon me, ma'am.

University of the
Rio Grande Valley.

We spoke on the phone.

Sheriff, do you or
your deputy have

Any comment on the series
of animal mutilations

That have gone on here?

All right, now, hold on, ma'am?

Now do you have
any more information

About the unusual circumstances
surrounding my uncle's

Death, Charles Esperanza?

Tell us, sheriff, what kind
of animal leaves no tracks.

Um... ma'am, our investigation
found that Charlies

Esperanza had been
attacked by a wild

Animal as far as we can tell.

But I can assure you
that our department is...

Mm, hm.

Look, all I can tell you now...

Is that you can't
tell us anything.

You best settle down, ma'am.

Sheriff, my uncle was
murdered here last week.

And you are... you're writing it
off like an animal mutilation.

It's just...

I'm doing the best
job that I can, ma'am.

But there's a lot to this
than... turn that thing off.

Don't touch my camera.

Shut it down now.

Just turn the damn thing
off, would you, please?

Don't touch... keep your
hands off my equipment.

All right, that's enough.

Nice going, fellas.

You all right?

I'm fine.

Sir, your people
and your crypto

Whatever van are
drawing folks in here

From all over Haldago
and Cameron Counties.

Pretty soon some idiot down in
McCallens is call a tach alert.

And every state
agency in Texas is

Going to converge on
our quiet little town

And raise all kinds of hell.

I think it's a little
late for that, don't you?

I would consider 100
livestock mutilation

In an isolated area in a one
month period of time a hell

Raising event.

Turn that thing off now.

There's no vote.

It stops here.

What stops here, sheriff?

The media link?

Or is this where the
conspiracy starts?

Chupacabra.


The discovery of the Chupacabra
has given cryptozoology

Another notch to the
belt. But before we

Pat ourselves on the back,
there are many questions

That need answers.

For example, where does
a Chupacabra derive from?

Is it mammal or reptilian?

We have actual footage... video
footage... of a Chupacabra.

We've studied it, scrutinized
it, frame by frame.

And what do we see is a
Chupacabra that move and reacts

Like a primate,
almost humanistic.

But the samples of DNA
that we have clearly

State that the Chupacabra
is a cold blooded reptile.

[Cat screeching]

[Gun shots]

Hold you fire.

Well?

Congratulations, you
just scared the piss

Out of a man-eating pussy cat.

Put your gun down, stupid.

Hector, you...

I've got enough coverage.

Let's just get out of here.

Cort, cover them.

All right.

Where is that fricking thing?

Oh, it's just the Curandera...


PETE CORTEZ: Maria,
I'm going to get this.

I'm going to get it now.

No, Pete, listen,
it's not worth it.

Look, just let it go.

Nobody move him.

I think he's going to be OK.

Just let him come to on his own.

What about the sheriff?

Oh, God.

MARIA ESPERANZA: Oh, oh, my god.

Oh, my god, he's dead.

MARIA ESPERANZA:
It's everywhere.

PETE CORTEZ: There's
an opening right here.

This is where I
think he got out.

Come on.

Come on.

Are you sure?

Be careful.

I don't see it.

All right be careful.

MARIA ESPERANZA: All
right, Cort, you got this?

PETE CORTEZ: I got it all.

Easy.

Watch out.

Where'd he go?

I don't see anything.

This thing has
more intelligence

Than a normal animal.

Yeah, have you seen the video.

That thing almost
seems to fly sometimes.

And actually, it's
kind of clumsy.

I mean, its legs are too heavy
for this earth's gravity.

Yeah, you put all these things
together, and it's obvious.

This thing isn't of this earth.

PETE CORTEZ: I
think... I think it

Went straight ahead that way.

Webster, I want you
to go to the hill

And get some
coverage over there.

Jackson, do you think you can
get some more police out here?

Hell, the police
were in the barn,

Smacked and splattered
all over the place.

Where do you suppose it went?

PETE CORTEZ: Heck, I don't know.

But I'd just keep quiet.

That thing might be smarter
than the both of us.

Hey, I think it went this way.


[Speaking spanish]

It's OK.

It's OK.

We're going to help you.

LLOYD JACKSON: Take
it easy, Maria.

PETE CORTEZ: Is she hurt bad?

I can't tell.

Look, it's me.

It's Maria.

Look at me.

Look.

We can help you.

It's Maria.

She's got trauma to the head.

Pupils are dilated.

Beyond that, I can't tell.

We're going to help you.

Can you walk.

LLOYD JACKSON: Give us some
help with this poor old woman.

Come inside.

Webster, help out.

You OK?

Let's go.

You're OK.

Hold on.

PETE CORTEZ: What
the hell is that?

Well, any new information
regarding the Loch Monster,

The Roswell incident,
the infestation of crack

Deliberately in the inner
cities, and now the Chupacabra

Is going to be veiled in
secrecy by the government.

There's a lot about this
animal the government is not

Telling us.

They've not responded to
any of the allegations

That the Chupacabra was created
in a lab in Puerto Rico.

PETE CORTEZ: You OK?

PETE CORTEZ: Armistad?

Armistad, are you OK?

I think he's awake.

Amigo, wake up.

Amigo, wake up.

Amigo.


Yeah

You know what I think, I
think your amigo is awake.

He was... he was lying
there and he thought

He was seeing the Chupacabra.

He's a little loco.

Glad you could
make it, corporal.

Where's Esperanza.

PETE CORTEZ: She's
inside the ranch

House helping the Curandera.

And what the hell is hanging
outside your doorway?

Hector, it smells not
like rotten garbage.

I had something like that
pried out of my ass in Nam.

Armistad, you're delirious.

You were never in Vietnam.

You were 10 years old.

Try not to talk and
conserve your energy.

[Speaking spanish]

Garlic salt charm given
to my by some witches

To ward off Chupacabra.

PETE CORTEZ: Does it work?

Until here.

Once again, the
means of extracting

Information from
the enemy surpasses

Anything you've ever done.

PETE CORTEZ: Where
are these witches?

And where can we find them?

I've seen them drink
some beer in cantina.

I can take you there
if you want me to.

I have seen them do things
that normal people cannot do.

Such as?

Keep away Chupacabra.

Armi, are you all right.

Finally, somebody
with some dog sense.

I think that was a compliment.

Are you OK?

We didn't mean to
leave you all alone,

But I checked out you out.

And it seemed OK.

It's OK.

I'm all right.

Do you know where the
Chupacabra's nest is?

Yeah, but lociento, I
would never go there.

All right, Armi, are you
thinking clear enough?

Yeah.

Do you have any ideas?

Well, Hector, do
you think you gather

Enough men tonight, help
us surround the goat pen,

Track Chupacabra.

I can get some stronger darts.

Senor, Chupacabra
is very strong.

We're very lucky to be alive.

Only a loco would
go look for it.

[Music playing]

We were caught a
little of guard earlier.

We didn't know what to expect.

But we've had a
little experience now.

And we're going to
try catch this thing.

We're here in the
goat pen, hoping

That he will come
back to the same place

That he fed on last night.

It's about 10:00 PM, so we
think we got a little time,

Since he struck about 1:00.

Armi seems to have gotten
a stronger dart together.

Armi, how we doing?

I got a much stronger
load this time.

I get enough
tranquilizer in that dart

To stop a heard elephants.

We'll be ready for him.

In case that doesn't
work, I got my shot gun.

Basically, we're just going
to hide out here in the barn,

Be ready, stay alert,
and see what happens.

We've got some movement.

You got a wide shot?

PETE CORTEZ: Yeah, I got
the whole whole group.

OK, good work.

Did you hear that?

Where the...

I haven't had a welcome
like that since...


Go, go, go, go!

MARIA ESPERANZA: Get the door.

Get the door, get the door.

Jesus.

Where's Armi?

He's still out there with
that thing and Jackson.

And we don't know
where that thing is.

Let him in.

Where's the molester?

Open the door.

Please, open the door.

Hurry up.

Just quick pulling
on the handle.

Here, take this.

Hurry.


I don't want to die
here in this van.

Shut up.

You would have just
watch me die out there.

Well, screw this.

This is not why I came here.

I want to leave.

You can't leave.

People are dying.

Lives are being wrecked.

We can't just pack up and leave.

You knew it was going
to be dangerous when

You signed on for this unit.

Come on.

I can't believe this.

Wait.

Where is it?

Hold on.

Hold up.

I don't hear anything.

Well, what are
we supposed to do.

Sit in here all night?

Well, who's got the keys?

I do.

At least I thought I did.

DANIEL WEBSTER:
Ah, that's great.

Just great.

Look, Webster, I've had all the
crap I can take from you today.

If you can't help the
situation, keep your mouth shut.


I can't get a
clear shot at him.

I saw him.

I saw him.
I got 'em.

I got 'em.

I got 'em.

Let's get out of here.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

I have the tapes.

Excuse me.

You want the surveillance
tapes, I've got 'em.

Have you seen what's one them?

Yeah, I have.

Was my uncle killed
by the Chupacabra?

Yes, ma'am, he was.

What?

Why the cover up?

Because the sheriff
figured it was in the best

Interest of the general public.

I don't know.

Why?

To keep information that
could drastically change

Science, history, genetics.

I don't believe this.

Wait.

Why are you talking
about the tapes now?

Because I think... I figured you
should know the truth before...

Just in case... just in case.

Now we can't do
anything about it.

I got to get this
thing started.


What is that?

It's on the roof.

Jesus.

Armi, try again.

Let's get this
thing started, man.

We're trapped.

I can't see him.

Wait, there he is.

Wait.

Look.

Look, there he goes.

He's heading down the hill.
Is he gone?

Quiet.
Quiet down.

Quiet down.

Quiet down.

Look, obviously this
isn't going to work.

OK, we're going to have to make
a break for the ranch house.

Run.

I'll lead.

Deputy Lowe, you back us up.

Do you think you
can handle that?

I can handle it.

Let's just do it.

All right, is everybody ready?

Are you ready?

I said, are you ready?

DANIEL WEBSTER: Fine.

Let's do it.

Let's get out of here.

Go, go, go.

Another interesting
question that

Needs an answer is
early eyewitness

Indicates that
the Chupacabra was

A small, as like a
little kitten, no larger

Than a rottweiler.

But this Chupacabra
is huge, enormous.

Well, judging
from the video, it

Seems very similar
to the theropods,

Which were present in the
middle Triassic period.

The most famous of these
was the tyrannosaurus.

The smallest was the
compsognathus, which was

Only about 2 and 1/2 feet tall.

One interesting point
is that theropods

Were very numerous in what is
now known as South America.

We know that theropods
walked on their hind legs.

They had large heads,
very sharp teeth.

The notion that the
Chupacabra could

Be a descendant from
one of these theropods

Is an interesting one.

But the theropods disappeared
by the Cretaceous period.

It's pretty difficult to
give a definite answer.

But it's possible.

At least, I think so.

This isn't good.

It's going to take forever for
the paramedics to get out here.


It hurts.

I know.

Just relax.

I've seen 911 take two
hours to get to these parts.

Deputy, the Sheriff and I
were discussing the photos

Of my uncles crime scene.

He said I could pick them
up at the coroner's office.

Would that be where I
might find the tapes

Of what happened to him.

You know, you really
don't know what you're

Dealing with here, do you?

You know, Miss Esperanza,
this is probably the biggest,

Baddest Chupacabra in the world.

No, this is the granddaddy
of all Chupacabras

From what I understand.

But you know, they
don't tell me much.

No, see, the Chupacabra
policy is basically

Need to know basis only.

I mean, the boy
never had a chance.

Feel so horrible and stupid.

Hector's been with
me for seven years.

He just stood up
at the last second.

Mr. Jackson, we were all
running around It was crazy.

It was an accident.

No one is blaming you.

He used to eat his lunch every
day under the old oak tree.

Mr. Jackson, what we
have to concentrate on now

Is making sure that thing
doesn't hurt anyone else.

Wait, Hector told me that
there's a couple of witches

And... and they hang out
over at the cantina.

Witches?

I grew up in this town.

Everyone here is superstition.

It's... it's in our nature.

Those two girls
are really weird.

But everyone around
here believes

They've got strange powers.

And, you know what?

All my beliefs have been
blown to smithereens.

I... I could see it.

I guess I could believe
anything right now.

Well, so far we've got
a couple dead goats,

A sheriff with his
guts falling out,

And a ranch hand with
his head blown off.

What has to happen before we
decide to split this scene?

I've been bitten.

What?

What bit you?

That thing.

The Chupacabra?

Yeah, it was in the goat pen.

And everything was happening.

I didn't know at first.

It just was stinging.

But then I...

Doom, mija.

My god.

You are doomed.

You're going to die.

You only salvation is
[speaking spanish] hair

Of the dog.

Great, so maybe if we stick
around here long enough so

The rest can be bitten as well.

You better sit
down and shut up.

Or I'll come over
and do it for you.

Oh, man, you shut up.

Just calm down.

Who knows what kind of
diseases that may have.

Calm down.

Calm down.

Besides I haven't had my
Chupacabra vaccine yet.

Webster, everyone
needs to just calm down.

We're not getting
anywhere with this.

We just need a
good night's rest.

We need to be ready for whatever
is going to happen tomorrow.

I've got some antiseptic
and some bandages.

Patch you right up.

There are bunks in
here for the crew,

And I've got room
for the curandera

Woman and Miss Esperanza.

Victor.

And the cross.

Victor, why don't
you say a few words.

You know him better
than anyone else.

[Speaking spanish]

Amen.

All right.

Let's get out of here.

That thing's still out here.

Let's go.

Get the shovels.

Victor, please.

Nothing else we
can do for him now.

So Mr. Jackson, do you see
the girls we're looking for.

I mean are they here?

I'm not sure, but I think
that's them over there.

What do you know about the
Jackson's ranch last night.

Are you... are you...

[Speaking spanish]

We must not talk
about this here.

Look, we have a place
at the old brewery.

Take us there and
we can talk then.

[Speaking spanish]

Put him on the table.

Another person was bit by
the Chupacabra yesterday.

I see that.

Your flesh rots as we speak.

Relax, it will be out soon.

The pain our friend
endures is but a drop

Of water in the
black sea of pain

In which you will soon drown.

The Chupacabra bite is deadly.

It's venom possesses.

Such bile and infection
that will soon rot away

And melt down your insides.

The worst part is near the
end when you start passing

Your own guts into the toilet.

Sometimes it takes hours.

Sometimes takes weeks.

And sometimes it takes months.

But the curandera
said that our salvation

Was in the hair of the dog.

What does that mean?

The only antidote
is the Chupacabra.

Only you can kill
it to rid your soul

Of a Chupacabra's infection.

All right.

All right.

All right.

What's wrong with him?

The Chupacabra attacked
and bit him last summer.

He grows more sick each day.

We're waiting for
the swell of death.

Kill me.

Kill her.

We understand that you can
take us to the Chupacabra's den.

Den?

That's a good one.

It's a hole.

Your sources are wrong.

You have my word.

Armi, give you 50 bucks.

What's wrong with
you, Esperanza?

75.

100 American dollars cash.

Due in advance.

Wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

Not so fast.

How do we know you're
not fussing with us?

Fine.

Forget it.

Find it yourself.

[Music playing]

Armi, the money.

Here's $50.

You get the other 50, when we
get to the Chupacabra's lair.

No, I'll take the
second half now.

This is ridiculous.

Let's just get out here now.

Give the money back.

Hold on there, boys.

I've seen these girls around.

They'll do what they say.

Well the very existence
of such a creature,

Such as the Chupacabra, makes
us wonder about its origin.

I believe with many
of my parishioners

That the Chupacabra is
not an embodiment of evil.

To say that it's a creation
of Satan would be a mistake.

I believe that all animals were
placed on this earth by God.

There's no creature on
earth that's inherently

Evil, except perhaps for man.

It's the myth that
flourishes behind this animal

That gives rise to the
statement that it's

A device of the devil.

Of course, I understand
why many people

Think the Chupacabra is evil.

Uh... for instance, the
Hispanic culture is

Alive with myths and legends.

The people of Mexico, for
example, are devoutly Catholic.

They're very religious,
but equally superstitious.

They'll believe what
they want to believe.

And even the Pope couldn't make
them think any differently.

Do you know where we are?

Are we there yet?

Jackson, pull off
here to the right.

OK.

I guess nobody with good sense
comes out this way anyway.

This is good.

Hold on.

We go on foot from here.

How far are we walking anyway?

Jackson, keep your eyes peeled.

Webster, we got something.

Check it out.

Oh, god.

God.

Webster, cover it wide.

This is disgusting.

I think I'm going be sick.

Part of its
tissue's picked away.

Probably by animals.

It's looks like he's
been here for weeks.

Let's go.

Wow.

Let's go.

Hey, I've got
something over here.

There's another one.

God

Real fresh.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, no.

Jackson, keep your eyes peeled.

My god.

Dios mio, Carlos.

My god.

Hail, hail, great one, be with
me now and deliver this soul.

[Non-english speech]


Got you.

I got you.

What the hell is
wrong with her?

What do we do now?

Everyone just be quiet.

Hey, hey, hey, just
give that to me.

Stop.


Get her under control.

Look at her.

What the hell.

I have been...

Leave now.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Let's go, go.

My feet hurt.

DANIEL WEBSTER: How many
people have to die before we

Get to this Chupacabra's nest?

I'm sick of this.

Look, why don't
you shut your mouth.

We have no communication.

And we're out here all alone.

Do you hear anybody
else complaining.

Maria, are you OK?

Yeah.

We can rest if we need to.

There's no time.

Are you sure?

Come on.

Maria, are you OK?

I'm just dizzy that's all.

She's definitely
running a fever.

Sarah, how much further is it?

DANIEL WEBSTER: I'm
not going much further.

We're here.

Oh, hell.

Those were put up to
ward away intruders.

I'm from around here.

Anybody who walks through
those doesn't come back out.

MARIA ESPERANZA:
What is this place?

This is where the
Chupacabra lives.

GEORGE ARMISTAD: OK,
people, show time.

Jackson, how many
rounds you got with you?

LLOYD JACKSON: Five in this gun.

Two in each of these pockets.

MARIA ESPERANZA: Armi, how many
of those darts did you bring?

GEORGE ARMISTAD: I got it
up to jack ten Chupacabras.

I got one speed loader left.

That's it.

DANIEL WEBSTER: Hey,
guys, guys, wait up.

GEORGE ARMISTAD: Deputy
Lowe, I want you and Jackson

To cover this perimeter.

Webster, Maria and myself
will be in this direction.

Sarah, I want you...

No, I'm staying here.

Wait, Armi, we've shot at
this thing how many times?

It didn't affect it one bit.

Is it just going to
kill another one of us?

I don't understand.

DANIEL WEBSTER: I'm with that.

Look, this Chupacabra has got
to be vulnerable somewhere.

I mean I can use its eyes as a
port to its brain or its mouth.

I mean, there's a lot
of soft tissue in there.

DANIEL WEBSTER: Yeah, but
what if none of that works?

What then?

Then we'll just use the
rest of the afternoon

To work on plan B.

DANIEL WEBSTER: I thought Maria
already alluded to plan B,

Going back to the ranch house.

Look, I've had just
about enough of your...

DEPUTY LOWE: Over here.

Maria, over here.

GEORGE ARMISTAD: OK,
what do we have here?

The cave, fed by the
last people just like you.

And stuff they left behind.

GEORGE ARMISTAD: Careful.

See they tried to blow it up.

OK, here's what
we're going to do.

We're going to
use that dynamite.

We're going to blow up
the hole to its den.

Block the entrance.

Then when it comes
back from its hunt,

It will at least be confused,
disoriented, frustrated.

Then maybe we have a chance.

Armi, think we if
turn this the thing up

We could make it strong
enough to hold that thing in.

I can get in done.

It's not as strong as I'd
like it to be, but if it was,

Then we wouldn't be
able to up right it.

And then I'm going to
position myself inside.

What?

As bait?

Yeah, don't worry.

It'll work.

Listen, this is
a tricky monster.

We've all seen a lot.

Armi, I'm with you.

I'm going to go inside the
cage to get some coverage.

Let's do it, buddy.

Let's do this.

But if we can get the
Chupacabra in the cage,

We could get some back
up back up out here

And secure this thing
once and for all.

I agree.

Let's get started.

Let's turn this thing over.

Lift on three.

One, two, three.

Hey, Cort, you up?

PETE CORTEZ: Yeah.

The guys are trying to
make this thing strong.

In case this doesn't work,
in case we don't make it,

Whoever finds this tape, you'll
know this Chupacabra is real.

We did everything within
our power to kill it.

Just like the witch told us.

This is the opening to
the Chupacabra's lair.

I got enough dynamite that
the force of the blast

Should seal it shut.

Once that happens, Chupacabra's
got to play by our rules.

Cort, I want you to move back.

Take cover.

OK, Cort, here we go.


With us inside as bait and
the Chupacabra den blown shut,

It should come straight for us.

At that point, I got
a dart waiting for it.

I'll go ahead and drag it
inside, secure the cage,

Douse it with
gasoline, light it up.

Now, if anything goes
wrong, I got the deputy

And Jackson to back me up.

Guys, make sure
you shoot to kill.

DEPUTY LOWE: I'll be
unloading on that son of gun.

LLOYD JACKSON: I'll
be here for you, man.

OK, it's getting late,
so let's get to it.

Thanks, I'm going to need it.

All right, Cortez.

OK, the door is closed.

I'm going to put
this knot in the wire

So you boys can get
at it if you need to.

Let's just say you boys
are crazy for doing this.

But good luck.

Armi, are you ready?

I'm ready.

Hey, Armi, Cort,
you guys OK up there?

Oh, my god.

No, Armi, it's Louisa.

Sarah?

Sarah?

She left us.

Oh, my god.

Did that thing do that to you?

Sarah!

Louisa, she's gone.

We don't know where she is.

I can't die alone.

We're here.

We'll help you.

Not with strangers.

Sarah!

She's dead already.

I heard it.

PETE CORTEZ: OK, I'm rolling.

Keep your eyes peeled.

PETE CORTEZ: Did you hear that?

I can feel it.

Get ready, Cor.


Quiet, quiet.

Why didn't...

Quiet.

Get ready.


I'm getting out of here.

I'm getting out of here.

Calm down.

Keep your composure.

Quiet.

That thing isl still out there.


You all right, Cort?

PETE CORTEZ: I'm fine.

Keep your eyes peeled.


PETE CORTEZ: Stay down.

Shoot it.


Sit tight.

Sit tight.

PETE CORTEZ: It's going down.

It's still moving.

Listen, stay here.

I'm going to go in
for a better shot.

It's down.

That's it.

Cort, here's what
I want you to do.

Go back.

Tell the others to stay put
until I get this thing secured

In the cage...


Stay back, Cort.

Get out of here.

What's going on up there?

Who is that?

It's Cort.

What the hell's going
on up there, buddy?

Jesus, man, what's going on?

MARIA ESPERANZA: Where's Armi?

LLOYD JACKSON: What's going on?

What is it?

What is it?

DEPUTY LOWE: Is that thing
coming down here or what?

LLOYD JACKSON: Go on, Cort.

DEPUTY LOWE: Talk to us, man.

Careful.

Is this where he was, Cort?

PETE CORTEZ: Straight ahead.

DEPUTY LOWE: Stay alert.

Guys, rifle's
still in the cage.

MARIA ESPERANZA: Where's Armi?

There's a dart still in it.

I thought he was with me.

I don't know.

Armistad?

Armi.


[Gun shot]

It's still moving.

Is he all right?

He's down.

Let's drag his ass
into that cage.

Give me a hand Stay
away from his mouth.

Cortez, hand me the
Molotov cocktail.

You're too close to him.

Get out of there.

Let's set the cage a blazing.

We'll get the hell out of here.

Let me get the wire.

Get the hell out of here.

Well, hang on.

I got to wire this shut.

All right, go ahead.

I'm going to burn
this son of a bitch.

He's moving.

Go.

Let's get out of here.


Oh... oh, my god, look.


Oh, my god.

What do we do?

Yeah, what now?

MARIA ESPERANZA: Jackson!

Are you crazy?

Leave him there.

He's up.

Hurry up, Jackson.

We got to get the
hell out of here.


Where?

Tell me.

What happened?

That thing blew up on me.

MARIA ESPERANZA:
Oh, can you make it?

I think I'll be all right.

Come on, that thing is awake,
We got to get out of here.

Come on.

Up here.

Hurry, hurry.

She's moving.

I can't hold on.

I can't hold on.

I'm coming.

Careful.

She all right?

Be careful.

No no, no, get back up here.

Maria, are you OK?

I think so.

God, my knee.

Cort, get me out of here.

PETE CORTEZ: Give
me your hand, Maria.

Are you up?

Hello.

We got to get in there.

Where's the way in there?

Hello?

Let us in.

Please.

Why are they opening the door?

I know you can hear us in there.

I'm a deputy sheriff and this
is an emergency situation.

And I want you to
open this door.


God, hurry.

Open this god damn door now.

You've got five seconds.

Five, four, three...

Jackson, have a seat.

Come in.

Are you OK?

We didn't mean to scare you.

I don't think they
speak English, Cort.

[Speaking spanish]

We're not the border patrol.

[Speaking spanish]

Please.

I hope I said that right.

DANIEL WEBSTER: Cort, what
are we going to do now?

We're going to stay
here for the night.

At first light, we'll
head for the car

And make it back to town.

Maria is not doing too well.

And Jackson's burned pretty
bad, but he's stable.

I'm sure they'll both
make it through the night.

It's just way to
quiet out there.

Can't you do something
to board that up.

Web, you're making me dizzy.

I don't know.

It's way to quiet out there.

It's making me nervous.

It's going to be all right.

It's going to be all right.

I'll find something.

How about one of these boards?

We can pull on of
these boards up here.

[Speaking spanish]

Ask one of those
guys if they've got

Some nails around here...



Be careful.

What is it?

Does he know how
to use that thing?

Get away from that window.

Stay away from the door.

[Speaking spanish]

DANIEL WEBSTER: No,
don't go out there.

MARIA ESPERANZA: Stop.

[Short roar]

[Gun shots]

Where'd he go?


Hey, Web, look at this.

Dr. Hernandez, what
do you make of this?

DOCTOR HERNANDEZ: Looks
Like a bar code to me.

MARIA ESPERANZA:
That's what I thought.

You know what that means.

DOCTOR HERNANDEZ:
It's interesting.

We're here at the cryptozoology
lab at the University

Of the Rio Grande Valley.

We're about to do an
autopsy on this specimen.

It's been in cold storage
for about 48 hours

Since it expired.

We know it seems hasty, but...
Well... before any government

Agencies takeover, like
the CDC or the FBI,

We want to know the truth.

Maria, before we start
cutting into the specimen,

I'd really like to examine it.

This huge cranium, I believe
that's why most people believe

It to be extraterrestrial.

Look at this mandible.

Yeah, I noticed the
angle of langerhans.

DOCTOR HERNANDEZ:
Look at the canines.

See how they protrude
forward instead of down?

Yeah I noticed that earlier.

DOCTOR HERNANDEZ:
That makes me believe

They're used for
holding or grabbing

Rather than biting or tearing.

And there's no occlusion
between the teeth.

The grasping and
holding design is also

Apparent in the double
phalange... hand or paw.

We noticed that up close and
personal, didn't we, Cort?

PETE CORTEZ: Yeah, I try
not to think about it.

I try to put that in the past.

We noticed, doctor, that it has
six areolas, but not just that.

It actually has
developed mammary glands.

But its reproductive
organs are undeveloped.

Do you think it
could be asexual?

Quite possible.

I guess we'll find out
when we cut open, huh?

Maria, this flesh
is almost wing-like.

I know, there
were times when it

Seemed to glide through
the air like it was flying.

Doctor, what do you think
of this spinal material?

It looks like an extension
of the spinal cord.

Interesting.

DOCTOR HERNANDEZ: The tarsals
and metatarsals are double

Flinched, just like the claws.

The feet are extremely flat.

MARIA ESPERANZA: That
explains all the jumping

And landing he did so well.

Ready to take a look inside?

DOCTOR HERNANDEZ: Yes.

MARIA ESPERANZA: We're
now going to a in-nucleate

The eye from its orbit.

Basically, remove the
eyeball from the eye socket.

In order to actually
release the eye,

I'm going to have to
sever the ocular tendon.

Hey, Cort, you getting
pictures of this?

We're almost there.

No wonder its eyes were glowing.

It's the humorous fluid.

The lingual bifurcation,
the forked tongue,

Explains how the specimen
was able to do the siphoning.

That's how he did it.

Can you get it?

Come on.

We're not going to take
a look at the viscera,

The internal organs, by cutting
in through the abdominal wall.

The doctor is cutting through...
Um... the mid-rectus abdominus

Muscle.

MARIA ESPERANZA: Post
autopsy DNA findings show

An erratic molecular structure.

It's as if the chromosomes
are in a battle for supremacy.

This is definitely
one of the most

Unique and disturbing genetic
strains I have ever seen.

As the mayor, I
have seen the people

Come together as a community.

They have watched for
each other's animals,

For each other's safety, for
the good of the children,

And definitely for the
good of each other.

I'm not saying that some of them
are at fear for their lives.

But as you know this has been a
major problem for quite awhile.

And of late, it has become
an even bigger problem.

And it is disastrous
to our well being.

The community thrives
on their animals.

And it is essential that the
breeding stock be preserved.

So they've had to take extra
time and care with the animals.

They can't leave
them in the field.

They have to be very
cautious about the timeliness

And work together
to bring them in.

How's life been?

Well, it's been
pretty quiet in Santa

Maria since all that happened.

Even the curandera
lady got better.

She's kind of local
healer around here.

Things have been pretty
easy going since then.

And I guess for me too.

I've been going though
a healing process.

It's been painful.

But I'm making progress.

Glad the ordeal is
all over though.

It was pretty devastating.

I don't ever want to endure
something like that again.

But the information that was
acquired, it's priceless.

I just feel really bad that
so many people didn't make it.

[Music playing]

It's kind of hard to
deal with sometimes,

You know, the
things that we saw.

Which you can read in my
new book, "Terror in Texas",

A Survivor's Story."

Yeah, we had our critics.

But for the most part,
the scientific community

Valued our work.

So did the tabloid
industry, ironically.

But I feel as... as if
we made a big sacrifice.

I mean, we put our
lives on the line.

But we accomplished
what we set out to do.

We found a Chupacabra.

There was this one critic.

It was awful.

He had nothing good
to say about us.

I remember what he wrote.

We shouldn't have
destroyed a living

Specimen, because it could
have been further studied.

Can you believe that?

Well, I got my Chupacabra.

I got mine.

NARRATOR: During the summer
following the Esperanza

Expedition, a videotape surfaced
from Sun Valley, California.

Its owner claims it
is also actual footage

Taken of a Chupacabra.

The tape has yet to
be authenticated.

MAN: Something's out there.

Something's out there.

SECOND MAN: Think it's the goat?

It's the goats.

MAN: Something's on the fence.

SECOND MAN: See anything?

MAN: I see nothing.

SECOND MAN: Where
the hell is it?

MAN: I'm trying to google it.


MAN: You get it?

SECOND MAN: Watch yourself.

Watch out.

MAN: Be careful.

SECOND MAN: What it that?

[Goats bleating]

SECOND MAN: I got
it right there.

MAN: Is it dead?

SECOND MAN: Yeah, I think so.

MAN: How do you think this
thing's worth, you think?

SECOND MAN: I don't know.

It stinks

MAN: That odor reeks.


MAN: It's moving.


Oh, shit.


MAN: Come here, Kev.
