Party wagon in full
effect, yo!

In full effect?

We're losin' Tiger Claw.
Move it, Leo.

DONATELLO: Hm, according
to the GPS it looks like

they're heading to the New York
Natural History Museum.

Dude, I hear they have an
awesome laser show at midnight.

I doubt they're going
to a laser show, Mikey.

Ten bucks and four peanut
butter-pepperoni pizzas

says they're out
to steal something.

Duh! I bet it's
a new helmet for Shredder--

like red with spikes
all over it,

and maybe with tassels.

MICHELANGELO:

What?
Tassels are cool!

Stay focused, Ninjas.
We're getting close.

Oh, I no like this van.
Is too small.

My knees is cramped.

I getting
Charley the Horse.

Stop complaining,
Rocksteady.

I'm the one who has
to drive you guys around.

Will you two imbeciles
be quiet for ten seconds!

I'm creating a plan
to steal the Kronite.

Okey dokeys.
I says nothing, comrade.

You're talking
right now!

He got you there, Rocksteady.

Now you're both talking.
I can't take it.

¶

[bumper thuds]
ROCKSTEADY: [groaning]

¶

[gasping]


Ah!

Oh, dudes, so cool.

Don't touch
anything, Mikey.

Ohhh...

[footsteps running]

Are those real
dinosaur bones, D?

They're fossils.

You see, when the bones
are buried in--

Could you wake me up

after all the science-y
exposition?

Awesome. Thanks.

[door opens]
Shhh, here they come.

Hm, I kinda spaced out

when Shredder told us
what the mission was.

We's looking for
the meeteetorite, Bebop.

Is big rock from
space, yah?

Has some kind of
special prooperties.

Prooperties?
You said prooperties.


[groaning] The meteorite
is an energy source--

extremely powerful
and incredibly rare.

It fell to Earth over
100 million years ago.

Yes, back when primitive
cave persons walked Earth.

Humans didn't exist
back then, Rockhead!

How many times I tell
you is Rocksteady?

Those two were never
the sharpest crayons in the box.

What's the deal,
fearless leader?

You and Donny
take Rocksteady.

Mikey, you've got Bebop.
I'll take Tiger Claw.

¶

Huh?

Ohhh...

¶

TIGER CLAW: The Kronite.

Is pretty.

You could make a killer
disco ball outta that.

It'd be tight!

[gasping, straining]

¶

MICHELANGELO:

[straining stops]

Whew!

[dinosaur bones
clattering, thudding]

OTHERS: Mikey!

Turtles? Here?

MICHELANGELO:


Oh, snap!

It's all light ditty-com.

[shouts of combat]

Haven't you
learned by now?

I am a Sensei and you
are barely a student!

[blade clattering]

Hold still, current.

You got nothin'
on Bebop, baby.

¶ Ooh hoo ¶
[snapping fingers]

Oh, no, you don't!

[grunt of effort]
Huh?

[shouts of combat]
[heavy thud]

Donny!

Over here, Rocksteady!

[heavy thud]

I squishes you like
the blueberry.

[heavy thud]

Rocksteady hate
when this happen.

Oh!
[weapon bonking]

¶

[thunderous rumbling]

Huh?
What's this?

[heavy thud]

Oh!

Got the space rock.
Let's haul shell.

I second that.

Ahhhhh!

[blowing raspberry]
[snarling]

MICHELANGELO:

ROCKSTEADY: [snarling]

MICHELANGELO:
Yah!

Hey?

No.

[growling]

[video game music]

Whaddup, Ice Cream Kitty?

Playin' some Marion Cart,
little friend?

[meowing]

I'm gonna examine
the meteorite in my lab.

It's so cool.
Great.

Get back to us on that while
we play some video games.

I call next game.

[meowing]

It's messed up,
Ice Cream Kitty.

[meowing]

[electrical zapping]

How's it goin', D?

The energy per square inch
this thing emanates

is off the charts.
[electrical zapping]

It's even more powerful
than the Krang energy crystals.

So, can you use it to power up
your super secret project

that I'm not supposed
to know about?

RAPHAEL: What is it?
A turtle tank or something?

No.

It is much more than that.

¶

DONATELLO: Ta-da,
it's my new shell-former--

a triple-changing
vehicle that can fly,

roll on treads,
and even transform

into a turtlebot!

A turtle robot
that transforms?

Dude! Dude! Dude!

I know.

I'll just add the crystals
as a power source.

Forget it, Donny.

We're taking that meteor
back to the museum

first thing tomorrow night.
Bad call.

Shredder's gang will
just steal it again.

Yeah, in the wrong hands,
it's beyond dangerous.

I wanna see it transform.

[imitates transforming
to turtlebot]

Hm....

test out a huge, oversized
transforming robo-mech

in the middle of New York?

I'm down.

¶

[brakes squealing]

¶

A close watch on those
turtles, Rocksteady.

My piggy nose
is never wrong.

Yah, we going
to bring turtles

and meeteetorite to Shredder.

Maybe he even let us keep
cool-looking fang.

Not to sound
like a bummer--

Uh, you'll sound
like one anyway?

This is a super
crazy bad idea--

like accent on
the "super crazy bad" part.

Have I mentioned it's
also a really terrible idea?

Let's test this puppy out.

And remember,
anyone who bothers me...

ejector seat button's
right there.

[powering up]
Yes, the crystals are working!

We're at 100 percent power.

Ooh, can we test out
"robot mode" first?

Mikey. Ejector seat.
Hmph!

Let's test out
"rocket jet" mode.

Rocket jet mode, it is.

[gears clanking]

[rockets blasting]

Come on, Rock.
¶ Ooh Hoo ¶

¶

[rockets blasting]

Maybe not so good idea.

TURTLES: [screaming]

Oh, no!
Whoa! Hold on, comrade!

TURTLES:
[screams distorting]

[explosion]

Volcanos!
[volcanos exploding]

Volcanos! Donny, turn!

ROCKSTEADY & BEBOP:


[thudding trees]

ALL: [screaming]
[thunderous thud]

[steam hissing]

[door clanks open]

Is everyone okay?

Not gonna say this was
an awful idea, but, uh...

Where are we, Donny?

Somehow we time-warped back
100 million years into the past.

[prehistoric bird
screeching]

¶

We're...we're
in prehistoric times?

Specifically the Cretaceous,

you know, give or take
20 or 30 million years.

Whoa, ho, ho.
Look at this place.

It's amazeballs!

Wow, is that like
a spikeadon or something?

It's a Stegosaurus.

Uh, I wouldn't
get too close.

[grunting]
Aw, it really likes me.

Can we keep it?
Can we? Please?

What do you think the answer
to that question is, Mikey?

[bell ringing]
Absolutely yes!

Donny, how the heck did
we end up in this nightmare?

I...I don't know.

It must be the Kronite.

When it overheated,
it somehow created

a temporal wormhole in
the time-space continuum--

Blah! Blah! Blah!
Blah! Blah! Blah!

Is that supposed
to make sense to me

or anyone else listening?

Who do you think
we are--NASA?

We went back in time!

[glass shattering]

Well, either way,
this is awesome!

So how do we get back?

It should be a problem.

We have enough time
crystals to get home.

Let's take a look around
before we leave.

Hang out for ten minutes.

Bad idea.
We've gotta get back.

Wow, look at that!

¶

Oh, my head is killing me.

Rocksteady,
where the heck are we?

I think we are
in the Jersey?

[pteranodon screeching]
BOTH: [screaming]

[screams echoing]

¶

Okay, cool,
we saw most of it.

Now let's go home.

Aw, cute.

They're like chickens
crossed with iguanas.

[grunting]

What a sweet,
friendly, spikey guy.

[grunting]
Whoa! Oh!

Ahhh! Help!

He-e-e-e-lp!

[foghorn blowing]

[insects buzzing]

Dino doo-doo?!

Mikey!

[grunting]

Oh, that's...that's a good
little giant Triceratops.

Take the nice weird
plant thing. Go on.

[chomping]


[bellowing, snapping]

That's all I've got,
little big friend.

Uh, easy, easy now.

Whoa! Ah!

[bellowing]
Ah! Ah!

Oh, stop it! Stop it!


Stop, little big guy!

You were right about this
place being dangerous, Leo.

Nice.
[screeching]

Hey, you little...

Stop, thief!

[squeaking]

Ah!

[squeaking]
Yeah!

[screeching]

Ha!

[squeaking]
Gimme that!

Get outta there!
[thudding log]

[screaming]

[dinosaur squeaking]

You evil little iguana.

OTHERS: [laughing]

Outsmarted
by a chickenosaur?

MICHELANGELO:

I don't believe
I heard you say that!

[quietly growling]

Aw, look at this one.
It's kinda cute.

[jaws snapping]
Whoa, and kinda bitey.

Easy, fella.

Wow, he's got
some sharp toenails.

Look at those things.

You need some toenail
clippers, don't you, buddy?

[growling]

[raptors growling]
Raptors!

TURTLES: [screaming]

MICHELANGELO: Ah!
Back off of me, man!

[jaws snapping]
We're gonna get eaten.

Raptors are amongst the
smartest, most adaptive--

Not now, Donny!

We need a plan!
[squeaking]

TURTLES:

Yah!

Aw, not the chuks, raptor!
[bonks on head]

[snarling, chomping]

Ha! Ha!

Oh, man, there's
too many of 'em.

[screeching, hooting]

RAPTORS: [whimpering]

Mikey, you're a...genius.
[thunderous footsteps]

Um, I don't think Mikey
scared it off.

[quietly growling]

[thudding trees]

[enormous roar]

Now everyone take it easy.

No sudden movements.

T-Rex has terrible eyesight.

Actually, that would
be a myth.

Uh, they have better
visual acuity

than eagles and...
and...and hawks.

Okay, run!

TURTLES: [screaming]

¶

Hm?

Do you have a plan "B"...
or "C" or "D"...

or any plan with
a letter?!

We can't stop a T-Rex
with sticks and blades.

Well, we can run!

I just said that! Run!
TURTLES: [screaming]

Keep turning, you guys!

T-Rexes are bad at turning!

[chomping]
[screaming]

Clear the jaws!
[jaws snapping]

Thanks, Mikey.
Like a turtle do.

No! Sorry about that!

No, I'm not.

[heavy thud]
Yes, I am.

You know what?
I don't...Ahhhh!



Ah! I hate pre-history!


[pteranodon screeching]

Get to the ship.
We've gotta save Raph.

[roaring]

[jaws snapping]


TURTLES:

Everyone inside, pronto!
Step to it!

[jaws snapping]


We made it! Whew.

Later, Rex!

All right,
let's save Raph.

Uh, any idea
where he could be?

Probably inside of that lizard
bird's stomach by now...

slowly being digested
into dino poop.

Can you be
any more disgusting?

Absolutely.

[pteranodon screeching]

your babies or whatever.

[screeching]
Easy now.

Don't bite me.

It's okay.

Here, I'll fix you up

That's right.
There you go.

It's cool, see?

There, good as new.

These new costumes
are tight, Rocksteady.

I didn't know you
were this good

at awesome crafts, dawg.

You be looking
totally hip, dude.

Hip, waist, stomach--
all of it.

Thank you.

So, how are we gonna
get outta here?

We've gotta find
those turtles.

They'll know how to get--

Uh-oh.

BOTH: [gasping]

[heavy thud]

[door clanks]
Raph!

You're okay!

Yeah, I'm okay,
little brother.

Let's get outta this
crazy time zone.

See what happens.

We were supposed to be
here for ten minutes--

ten minutes!

Leo's right.
Any more time here

could have macro cosmic
effects on the future.

We step on the wrong lizard
and humanity ceases to exist--

that kinda thing.

Wow, that's bad, dude.

So, let's get outta here.

[thudding footsteps]

Oh, great--
another one?

T-Rex is about to eat us!

TURTLES: [screaming]

Aw, poor guy.

He just wanted hugs.

He just wanted us
in his belly.

[thunderous thud]
TURTLES: [gasping]

Oh, no, the fuel is gone.

Oh, this is bad.

Without that meteorite,

we're basically
stuck here--forever.

So that means...no TV?
No video games?

No pizza?!

Look at all

This is crazy.
What are the odds?

Dudes, look.

They enslaved those
poor little dinosaurs.

We've gotta do something.

[laser humming]
[gasping]

All right, we go in--
full Ninja mode.

See what the Triceratons
are up to.

Be stealthy, my Ninjas.

¶

[gasping]

It's the time crystals.
OTHERS: Shhh.

They're mining
time crystals.

This is great!

There's more than enough
to get us home.

So how are we gonna
get it, genius?

I've got this, dudes.

You are dopier than that
dinosaur right there.

Alien intruders!

Turtles, attack!

Dudes, I think I'd rather be
fighting that T-Rex again.


Let's move, boys!

Unleash the robo-raptors.

Run like you've
never run before.

MICHELANGELO:

TURTLES: [screaming]

Ah, faster!
Faster! Faster!

Whoa!

We can't run.
We've gotta fight.

Bring 'em down.

Bring 'em do--

Whoa.

DINOSAURS: [growling]

RAPHAEL: Now that
goes in the top five

most awesome moments
in my life folder.

That'll hold
those strange aliens.

Who are you
calling strange?

You got a mirror handy?

[electrical zapping]

[heavy thud]

We is trapped here,
Comrade Bebop.

What will we dos?

They deactivated my weapons,

but they didn't
check my boot, son.

Secret stealth pack, you dig?

I got flash powder,
floss sticks,

breath mints, shurikens.

Ooh, I call shurikens.

No way, man.

I think I can use
them to do this...

[powering down]

BEBOP: See that?

Oh, das, das!

You is man!

We're not outta this yet.
Come on, let's go.

[power surging]

Oh...
[alarm blaring]

Let's move, man!
Come on, let's go!

BEBOP:

FEMALE VOICE:
What is this?

Alien prisoners escaping?

That fizzled.

They're gonna
vaporize us, dawg.

I love you, Bebop.
Hold me tight.

Lieutenant Zorg, take the
mutants to my command center.

As you wish, General Zera.

No, no, no,
hold on, lady.

Don't you know this guy?

Look at him.
He's one of you, of course.

He's a cousy wus.

Um, yah, we is cousins.

We are same species
of...um...

alien horn people.

[heavy thud]
BEBOP: [screaming]

Oh, man, trick no work.

Shhh, quiet down, dawg.

They've got some
kinda plan cookin'.

The Ore of Time
will empower us

in ways your pitiful minds
could never conceive.

Our great race
of Triceratons

will reap any time
period we want.

We can restore
our glorious empire

and rule the galaxy!

That sounds great.

That sounds terrible.

We better come up with
plan soon, Comrade Bebop.

¶

All right, let's go back
and get those time crystals.

Donny, if we're
going into battle,

you're gonna need
a dinosaur, bro.

Nah, I'm cool
with no dinosaur.

I have legs. I can walk.

I thought you
loved dinosaurs.

Not anymore.

Not enough to ride 'em.

What kind of dino would
be perfect for Donny?

Probably one of those goofy
duckbill lookin' guys.

It's a two-part
plan, dawg.

[heavenly choir singing]

BOTH: [face slap]
It's been confirmed.

You really are an idiot.

Take it, Donny.
Make peace.

No animals in any time
period can resist

pepperoni, maple syrup,
and peppermint sprinkles.

[pizza splats]
Trust me, Donny.

Look!
[sniffing]


Go to him.
Peace, love and animals.

Well, nice knowin'

Can I have the shell razor

[quietly snarling]

Here, T-Rex, nice T-Rex.

Please don't eat me.

TRICERATONS:

Woo!

Nice Rex.

Now let's get that

ROCKSTEADY: Got any good
escape plan yet, Comrade Bebop?

We distract the guard
and then grab

that key-looking
rock on his belt

and then use their com-link

to try to contact
the Turtles' t-phones.

That sounds like
a bad plan.

You don't have a com signal
in this time period.

Beep, y'all! Beep! Beep!
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!

General,
take a look at this.

Hm...zoom in.

The turtles have domesticated
the dinosaurs?

That's right and they're
gonna kick your horns in.

Yah, and we help them.

What should we do,
General Zera?

Round up the troops.
Protect the perimeter.

Activate the robo-spinosaurus!

But you've gotta promise
to turn over a new leaf.

Yo, check this out.

Leaf, turn over!
Turn over, leaf!

You'd better turn over!

You see, man,
it's that easy.

Boom, we're like
good guys.

Fine.
Make yourself useful.

Grab that time stuff
so we can go home.

We are on it,
Comrade Turtle.

I bet I can salvage parts

from the robo-spinosaurus
to fix the ship.

But the bigger challenge
is calculating

the correct chronal position
to travel to the future.

Right. Can you maybe
just hurry?

¶

Whew, well,
that wasn't such a chore.

It only took three days

Goodbye, little big fella.

I wish I could

Cool, Donny?

I mean, nothing bad's
gonna happen

Um, why yes, Leo,

I can't wait to relax
back in the lair,

play some video games...

...eat some pizza,
watch some TV.

I hope this works.

This isn't a time machine.

I had to do some calculations
based on temporal--

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's just go!

[engine starts]

[rockets blasting]

¶

[roaring]

[explosions]

[heavy thud]

Did we...make it?

¶

Oh, charoopa.

[alarms bleeping]

Where the heck are we?

Oh, any place
better than dinosaur place.

Whoa, dudes, I think
we're on the moon.

No, Mikey,
we're in New York...

in the future?

You gotta be kidding me.

¶

A giant statue of
Shredder in the future

can't be a good thing.

So, how about
we check the place out?

Just for ten minutes
or so?

¶ Ooh Hoo ¶
Yah! Yah!

Not again.

We're the Ninjas!
