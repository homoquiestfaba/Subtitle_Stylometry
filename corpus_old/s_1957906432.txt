Fuck!

<i>It's not</i>
<i>the blood you can't wash out</i>

<i>you should worry about.</i>

<i>It's the blood you can.</i>

Everything all right?

Yeah. I'm fine.
Fine. Why?

You get all that blood
off your hands preacher?

Well, he isn't actually
gonna speak, is he?

After all
his wife just died.

I have, uh, pastored
most of y'all for 20 years.

And, uh,
to be honest, I'm--

I'm up here...

because I don't know
how to do anything else.

She was the best
part of me.

Y'all know it, too.

Half the time
you be clamoring

to talk to her
after church and not me.

I've spent
my whole life...

waiting to talk to her.

I guess I'll be waiting
a little longer still.

A lot of people
have asked me...

what I think
of Troy Parker Junior...

about whether
he deserves to pay

for Elizabeth's life
with his own.

Love your enemies.

Pray for those
who hate you.

Lord, forgive us
our sins as we forgive

those who have sinned
against us.

I believe there is
power in forgiveness.

I have to believe that.

Otherwise, my Jesus
is a liar.

So I have talked
to the Texas district attorney

and requested that
Mr. Parker's sentence...

be fair and just...

but also with
the possibility of parole...

and redemption.

Hey, you want
dinner in a while?

Hey, you coming
down for dinner?

Samuel?

Samuel?

Parker!

Parker! Troy!

You coming or going?

Bus will be
along any minute.

Okay, so
if you come tomorrow--

Samuel.

Get in the car.

Am I in trouble or something?

Why would you assume
you were in trouble?

Because you haven't picked
me up since I was 13 years old.

Troy Parker
is being released today.

Mm. Five years, right?

'Cause you wouldn't testify?

It was
the right thing to do.

Being a pastor don't make you
the expert on what's right.

I just thought
you should know.

Hey, can you gimme
a hand at the church tonight?

I got homework.

Samuel, I can't do
everything myself.

Sorry.

You planning on
staying long?

No, ma'am.

Am I gonna
have trouble with you?

No, ma'am.

First, last, and security.

That's just about
all I got.

You always this welcoming?

I know who you are.

No smoking.

Sheriff's here.

Maureen.

Little early
in the day, ain't it Scott?

Come on.
You know what they say?

You can take
the cop outta the big city.

What happened?

Was driving by,
saw the truck on fire.

Local fire put it out.

That's when they found--

-Do we know who it is?
-Not yet.

Coroner's on their way,

-but they're in Paris and--
-And they drive slow.

Molasses.

Any guesses?

Working theory,

traveler passing through
for the night

looking for
a place to stay.

Doesn't explain
the gas though...

or the tracks.

Sorry, what's that?

Well, sometimes pickup truck
uses different tires

than a passenger car.

That's a mid-eighties Ford
that's running on LT metrics.

This is P.

I always said it was
good for cops to have hobbies.

That's why mine's origami.

There was another car.

Right. But, uh,
which means?

This isn't
where it happened.

Where are you going?

To find out
where it did.

Run the treads.
See where it takes us.

Sure.

I mean, I was gonna do that.
I just-- I--

How was
the service pastor?

I-- I probably
should have just called.

I heard you got out.

Yeah, just-- just yesterday.

You came back.

Did you hear
about my mom?

No.

Yeah, she, uh...

she fell sick...

a little over a year ago
and you know,

I figured once I got out
I'd come back and help her out.

You came by here.

Look, you-- you didn't
have to do what you did.

You know, about
my sentence and all.

You're welcome.

Yeah. All right.

Hey, Pastor.

Hey, you-- you wouldn't
know anyone who'd, you know,

hire an ex-con,
would you?

Afraid not.

Yeah, I didn't think so.

Uh, I'll--
I'll let you be.

Thank you, Pastor.

Yes, sir. I'm here.

No, sir, I'm not looking
to get into any trouble.

No, sir.

Got no plans
to leave the state.

Uh, yes sir.

Go ahead.

Uh-huh.

Yes, sir.

Will do.

Thank you, sir.

My PO said
he called you?

Haven't heard
a thing about it kid.

This is
the only job he sent me.

Will then I guess
you're just outta luck.

Thanks for nothing.

-Here let me.
-Oh, I got it.

Thank you.

How is
the job hunting going?

Well, I ended up
getting fired from a job

I never had
in the first place.

Yeah.
Times are tough.

Yeah, looks that way.

Uh, have-- have
a good one, Pastor.

If-- if you're looking
for work...

I guess I could--

I guess I could use
your help around here.

Sweeping and--
and cleaning and...

basic maintenance.

Can't pay much...

but maybe
it could help.

You, uh...

you offering me a job?

Yeah.
It looks that way.

Yeah.

Okay. Sure.

Thanks.

So, uh, what do you
want me to do?

Hey, Dad.

Samuel.

Okay. Look, Samuel.
I want--

Look, Samuel. Wait.

Samuel. Look-- look, he--

he came here to take care
of his mom, all right?

-He needed a job.
-Do what you want.

-Don't ask me to like it.
-Oh, Samuel, come on now.

-Your mother would've wanted--
-Hey, don't do that!

Don't even think
about doing that.

You stay away
from me.

I'm sorry.

Just another reason
to get outta here.

Did you hear
from Brown yet?

Not yet.

I need a full ride
so not really an incentive

to accept me.

Well, at least you're majoring
in public policy.

Gonna change the world.

I, on the other hand,
am going to be

a sausage cook at
the local Sizzler.

The world needs
good sausage cooks.

<i>â™ª Finding my way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I don't know how â™ª</i>

You gonna talk to him?

We don't talk.

-You live in the same house.
-It's not a home though.

Ain't been since--

since Mom.

Yo. Can I stay
here tonight?

<i>â™ª Nothing at all â™ª</i>

Of course.

<i>â™ª Nothing at all â™ª</i>

Come here.

<i>â™ª The more we grow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The further we fall â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We know nothing at all â™ª</i>

I'm sorry babe.

I-- I've been
meaning to get here.

It's just--
I don't forget.

Just--

sometimes it's hard
to remember.

Yeah, I wanna believe
that Samuel

comes by here
every now and again.

I hope he does.

I'm losing him.

Nah, I lost him.

I've lost him.
And I-- I don't know where.

I promise you,
I promise you I'll--

I will keep trying.

In the meantime,
it seems like there's somebody

I'm supposed to help.

I just hope
this is what you want.

What are you doing?

Light was out.

I don't know.
Felt wrong.

Tell you what...

this place's in better shape

than the chapel at Koppelman.

Yeah. Koppelman.

You been?

Uh, I used to get called
out there every now and again

before they got
a full-time chaplain.

Yeah, Chaplain Kerry.

Met with him
once or twice.

Was it hard...

what you did,
forgiving me?

Yes.

So why'd you do it?

You think
I shouldn't have?

You know, I met
a lot of guys in there.

Guys just like me.

No dads...

dropouts, screw ups.

I mean...

maybe we don't
deserve to get out.

Maybe we don't
deserve to be forgiven.

God forgives.

Yeah.

A lot of people said
that I shouldn't.

Lot of people...

said you didn't get
what you deserved.

The older I get,
I-- I realize that...

when we don't forgive...

we're the ones
who suffer the most.

I've suffered enough.

Uh, pastor.

Oh, hey, Willis,
um, we'll go to my office.

Duty calls. Um--

That there. That's good.

What? Got something
in my teeth?

The county's already
handling the deed transfer,

so we're done.

Yeah, your momma
talked about doing this

before she passed, but
I didn't think she was serious.

Yeah, you can
thank her someday.

It needs
a lot of work.

Yeah, I know.
I know.

This is the best job
you could get?

Guess so.

What do you want?

I'm just here
to take care of my mom, kid.

How did she die?

You really
want to talk about this?

No, I don't.
But here we are.

I wanna know
what you did.

I wanna know
what her last breath was like.

It was an accident.

An accident.

-It's true.
-Says who?

You?

-You don't wanna hear about it.
-Yes, I do.

No, you don't.

So that's it?

Stay outta my sight...

or I won't be responsible
for what happens.

And who will?

God?

I don't believe in God.

What? What?
He-- he just walked out?

No. No.
It is not like him at all.

But hang on.
Yeah, he-- he-- he's here now.

I'll call you back.

Samuel.

Excuse me!

Samuel! Boy, turn around.

What?

Your principal just called.

What'd she say?

She said you cut today?

Yeah?

What is this?
What-- what are you doing?

What are you doing?

Okay.

This is about Troy.

Would you like to
come down and talk about--

I don't.

She's giving you a break
because you're my son.

You cut again,
there will be consequences.

Okay. Thank you.

Look, Samuel,
I'm doing the best I can here.

Maureen.

Got your autopsy report.

Boy, are they slow.

-Joe has the file?
-Yeah.

It wasn't a drifter.

Who was it?

Why don't you
take a look?

Yep.

Hmm...

It's all yours?

-Hell of a place.
-Church's.

I'm gonna turn it
into a home

for abused women.

A place where they can
find a little hope.

Needs a lot
of work, doesn't it?

Yes, it does.

Let's go.

Three!

You-- you all right?

Uh, yeah.
Just some old battle wounds.

So, halfway house, huh?

Yeah.

That's what Elizabeth
always wanted.

Hmm.

She always got
what she wanted...

sooner or later.

What was she like?

I'm sorry.

-Look, I didn't mean--
-Mm-mm.

I didn't mean to.

-I just--
-Our last talk...

was a fight.

You're saying things
you don't even mean...

and then 24 hours later,

all you hear
are all the...

awful things you said

rattling around
your head like ghosts.

And all you
have are ghosts.

She wanted me
to take her out on a date.

She wasn't wrong either.

I-- I never got
that part right.

Always spending
all my time taking care

of everybody else
at the expense of us.

Bad habit.

Pastor habit.

I'm sorry
I walked away like that.

It's fine.

You know what you're saying,
it's honest.

There's something wrong
with being honest?

People don't want
their pastors honest.

They want 'em perfect.

Why?

To give 'em someone
to look up to?

Someone to resent.

Geez.

Not a lot
of hope there.

Your job
is to give them hope.

Give them the hope.

Where's the hope?
Don't forget the hope.

That's what
she used to say.

I am sorry.

I already forgave you.

Some things
take work, you know.

It's not the blood
you can't wash out

you should worry about.

It's the blood you can.

Don't tell Dad.

You too.

Hey, so,
what are we celebrating?

What?

I got a letter.

Brown?

Yeah. I got in.
Full ride.

Samuel. That's--

I know.

<i>â™ª Too hard to hold onto â™ª</i>

So what did
your dad say?

-I'm sorry. I should--
-It-- it's okay.

<i>â™ª So hard to hold on â™ª</i>

I didn't tell him yet.

Why not?

Because he was
gone all day.

Hanging out
with his new employee.

Yep.

<i>â™ª And I need you to stay â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So hard to hold onto â™ª</i>

The hell is this?

There a problem here?

There wasn't one
till they let you in here.

And why wouldn't they?

-Clear out.
-Lay off.

I want him outta here.

Look, I'm just trying
to have a drink with this lo--

I said
get the hell out!

All right.
Both of you out!

You know that anger
is a real problem, kid.

You too, Samuel.

He did his time.

Not enough.

Look, this side of you...

it scares me.

Let me out here.

I'll walk.
Clear my head.

Here.

My dad wants me
to stay safe.

Anyway, just take it.

Just in case he comes
after you or something.

I love you.

You shouldn't.

When were you
gonna tell me?

What you talking about?

Full ride?

Yeah.
Came yesterday.

Samuel, this is
a big deal.

I mean, it-- it is
everything you worked for.

You didn't wanna tell me?

You've been spending
all your time with Troy, so.

He's playing you.

Someday you gonna learn. Okay?

All this anger is just gonna
rot you from the inside out.

Okay.

Look, Samuel,
I'm trying here.

Thanks.

Yep, that's right.

The early bird
catches the worm.

Who owns this place?

Technically nobody.

Technically?

Well, this piece
of land belonged

to the Jo Hanson family.

Mm-hmm.

Mary Jo Hanson
died six months ago

and the rest of the family
left out of state.

So who owns it now?

Well, apparently
she gave it to the church.

Hey, pastor.

Oh, good.
So your phone does work.

Yeah. Um, I'm sorry.

Late night.

What do you
wanna do today?

You know what?
Have a seat.

Go on. Go on.

Did you, uh,
did you ever pray

with Chaplain Kerry
when you were in prison?

He asked me to
a couple times.

Wanted me to pray the--

what do you call it?
The-- the--

the sinner's prayer.

But you didn't want to.

I mean,
I know who I am.

Don't need
to tell God.

Yeah.

You see,
that's the thing though.

God already knows
who you've been.

He wants to know...

who do you wanna be.

So it's a confession...

of need...

a request for help...

and a pledge.

A pledge to live different.

All the things
you've done...

where you've been...

what you've seen.

All the--
the failures and mistakes,

those are the past.

Who you've been...

does not have to be
who you are...

if you are willing
to believe.

Will you pray with me?

Father God...

we come to you right now
humbled and broken.

Thank you--

No kidding.

Yeah.

Everything he always wanted,
you know,

a major in public policy,
learn the judicial system.

Then you
must be proud.

Yeah.
I am. I am.

You tell him?

Well, yeah, he knows.

You know.

You sure he knows?

Yeah. I will--
I will make sure.

In the meantime.

What's this?

It's just a-- a little
place you can call your own.

You know, you can,
um, when you can think

or work, whatever.

There's also this.

What's that?
Is that a Bible?

Uh, it's a journal actually.

Uh, a prayer journal.
See, you write your prayers in.

You know, I'm not really
that good of a writer.

Yeah, me neither.
But I-- I got a whole stack.

So I can look back
and remember what I prayed for

and then remember
where God showed up, so.

Job never stops
for you, does it?

No, it does not.

You know, come on.

I'll give you
a ride home.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

Thanks.

All right.
How's your mom doing?

She's doing all right.

You know,
I'd see her more,

but I got a side hustle at this
church keeping me really busy.

Yeah.

Yeah, I hear
that Pastor is a piece of work.

You know, he--
he is something.

He is something.

All right.

Let's get you home.

Hey, thanks again
for today.

My pleasure.
My pleasure.

All righty.

Home sweet home.
Thanks for the ride.

Yeah, of course.

Hey, you wanna come up?
See the place?

You know, maybe have
a beer or something?

Uh, probably not
a beer, huh?

N-- n-- no.

-Prob-- probably not.
-You like water?

Yeah. Water would be great.

Um, nice place.

A little--
little small, isn't it?

As long as I can stretch out,
I'm good.

Uh, you didn't wanna
move back with your mom?

Um, you know,
me and her...

we're sort of better
with a little distance.

Yeah.

Samuel is the same way.

Parents and kids, right?

I guess
that's why he, uh,

why he wants to leave.

He wants his space.

The truth is,
he's never home

even when he is there...

especially lately.

He thinks I'm--

I'm making
a mistake with you.

Wasting my time.

Lonely thing
trying to save people.

Lonelier still when
it's your own son.

I've always been
a better pastor than a father.

Same thing, isn't it?

Yeah, well, he--

he stopped listening to me
a long time ago.

Doesn't mean
you stop trying.

Look, pastor...

keep the faith.

If you don't, who will?

Yeah, I better--
I better get going.

Don't forget to use this.

I'll do my best.

Good night.

Little late, huh?

Yeah, I guess so.

How about you?
What did you do?

Homework at Kaitlyn's.

You?

Oh, just left the church.

You know, working late.

Everything okay?

It's fine.

Okay.

-See you tomorrow.
-Look...

I-- I know you hate
what I'm doing with Troy.

Figured that out yourself, huh?

I'm not
asking you to understand...

but I need you
to trust me son.

Trust you?

Yeah.

He killed mom.

-I know.
-He killed her.

I know.

He killed her.

He killed her.

-How can you just forgive?
-I can't.

I can't.

I never thought
I'd see him again.

It's one thing to-- to forgive
someone from far away.

It's another to do it

up close day in, day out.

But if I don't, then...

what did she die for?

What good comes of it?

Nothing.

She died so that
you could save his soul.

Mm-mm, she died...

and God is
giving me a chance...

to make something
out of it.

You too.

Come on.

I got you. I got you.

About that time.

Well, there's no such thing
as that time

when you are a pastor.

Ever wish there was?

Just about every time
I look at my paycheck.

Oh.

You-- you gonna be
all right getting home?

Uh, yeah.
I'll be all right.

You gonna be
all right getting home?

I'll be all right.

All right.

All right.

Have a good night, pastor.

Yeah, you too, Troy.

You too.

Hey.

Get in.

Thanks for the ride.

Your dad told me about Brown.

You must be really excited
to get outta here...

just like I was.

I'm nothing like you.

We're all the same, kid.

We've all sinned.

That's what
your dad taught me.

It was quick.

What?

Your mother,
how it happened.

That was the worst part...

she didn't fight it.

I held her
in my arms as she died.

Bleeding out
all over your floor.

It was
supposed to be quick.

Just a little
smash-and-grab.

I didn't think
anyone was home...

then she came
into the kitchen.

I got scared I-- I fired.

I'll never forget
what she said to me.

It's been five years...

and I've never forgotten.

"I forgive you."

Like what
kind of person does that?

Could I do that?

Could you?

Go ahead.

Make it quick.

I won't fight it either.

Troy?

Dad.

What happened?

Did someone see you?

No, no, no.
No one saw me.

Troy.

You-- you--
you need to move this.

-You need to get it outta here.
-What am I supposed to do?

I don't know.
I don't-- I don't care.

-Just get it out of here.
-Okay, fine.

I-- I-- I'll ditch the car
by the side of the road.

I-- I-- I'll wipe it clean.
It-- it'll be fine.

No, no, it won't.

The police are gonna
come looking for him,

when they do I-- I--

What-- what--
Are you gonna tell 'em?

-The man is dead.
-You're my father!

-What am I supposed to do?
-You sided with him

after he killed my mother!

Huh? Now you--

you are gonna
side with the police.

Who-- who's side
are you on, dad?

Uh!

Fine, I'll get
the same five years he did.

No you won't.

What--
what are you talking about?

You're 18.

You're a Black man in Texas.

You-- you get
premeditated homicide,

life without parole.

He gets five years
and I get life?

Wa-- was it an accident?

Just gimme a heads up
before you call 'em.

Take my car.

What?

Take my car and go home.

What are you gonna do?

Go home!

You get all that blood
off your hands, preacher.

Dad, what did you do?

Don't ask me.

What did you do, daddy?

Don't ask me...

ever.

Do you understand?

Go to school.

Marshall?

You're positive?

As positive as we can be.

That is--

that is horrible.

Mm.

I-- I understand
from his PO

that he was
working for you.

Uh, part-time. Yeah.

I mean, he was
having trouble finding a job.

Yeah, you don't think
he could have found a job

in any other fine
church in this town?

No, I don't know, Maureen,
he came to me.

I wonder why
he came back at all.

Well, his mom is sick.

His mom was dead.

She fell ill
a couple years ago.

Died fast.

What, then-- what?

You didn't know.

And you don't think
that maybe you just--

you just brought him on

so you could
keep an eye on him?

Wait for a moment
that was vulnerable.

I don't know and I gotta ask--

I gotta ask the questions.
That's my job.

No, we--
we didn't talk a whole lot.

He-- he worked mostly.
That's pretty much it.

Where were you that night?

Here, working.

All night?

Well,
eventually I did go home.

Uh-huh.

Samuel can vouch for that?

-Yeah, sure.
-I mean, maybe you just

don't have anything to do
with this at all?

I don't know,
I just have to know

-what I gotta know, you know?
-Hmm.

Hmm. So I'll be in touch.

You're kind.

What you were
trying to do for Troy,

it's better
than I would've done.

He was lost.

We all are.

Don't disappear
on me, Marshall.

Okay...

Did you know anything about it?

No.

I wish I did though.

I thank whoever did it.
Oh!

So you're glad about it?

Wouldn't you be?

Y'all got any suspects?

A few suspicions.

You two got into
an altercation, right?

Small town.
People talk.

Did you kill him?

You're real direct.

Uh-huh.

No...

but I wish I did.

Pretty direct yourself.

I'm just honest.

Understandably,
I can't take you at your word.

I-- I get why you're asking,
but it wasn't me.

Hmm.

Okay.
Well, thank you for your time.

-That's it?
-That's it.

I'm finished here.

Put a black and white on him.

I think so.
We'll see.

The witness
was driving-by

the night of the murder.

Said she saw a car parked off
to the side of the road.

Mm-hmm.

Here's the fun part.

She also saw a man
standing there alone.

And you're confident
about the timeline?

We'll see.

We've ran
the apartment for prints.

Oh!

Let me guess, you found mine.

We did.

Yeah, I was there...

a few nights ago.

I just baptized him.

He...

wanted to show me
his place and we talked.

Okay.

Here's the thing.

A dozen people saw

Samuel threaten Troy
at a bar

a few nights
before he died.

And his girlfriend said
that he had followed him

a few nights in a row...

and that she gave him a knife
to use in self defense.

What do you
want me to say, Maureen?

I want you to say
that you didn't know

that your-- your son was
antagonizing the man

that killed your wife.

I want you
to tell me that you--

you didn't know
that he threatened him.

I want you to tell me that
you didn't know any of this.

That's what I want you to tell.
Can you tell me?

Tell me!

I hired Troy
'cause I wanted to watch him.

Yeah, well,
I-- I was suspicious.

Maybe I was afraid...

when he asked
for a job, I thought,

"Hey, this is an opportunity."

An opportunity for what?

An opportunity to--
to-- to see if I was wrong

about him five years ago.

See if I-- if I gave him
a second chance,

I could say,
"See, he didn't want it."

Were you wrong about it?

What happened, Marshall?

This case
is gonna go to trial.

No, it won't.

I'm gonna plead guilty.

And the judge
will sentence you right there.

This is premeditated murder.

30 years to life.

You will never
see daylight again.

-I know all this.
-So why are you doing it?

If there is
reasonable doubt about you,

if the judge thinks
that in any way

you are
covering for Samuel...

he will stay the conviction...

the investigation
will continue

and I will have to go
after your son.

Do you understand me?

Okay.
So that's how it is?

Yeah. I guess.

I'm sorry, Marshall.

I am too.

I am too.

What are you doing?

He wanted this to happen.

I told you,
he is a murderer.

He is nothing
but a murderer.

How do-- how do you expect
someone like that to change?

Because sometimes
even a murderer...

needs a little grace.

I won't let you ruin your life.

Dad, Dad, don't do this.

No, I've made my decision.
The arraignment is tomorrow.

-I won't fight it.
-Dad-- dad, listen-- listen.

I'm done.

Okay, Marshall.

Sorry kid.

You looking for something?

Hello, Samuel.

How's it going?

Nice church.

I guess so.

My folks raised me Catholic.

I sat in pew every Sunday
until I made confirmation.

It was the first thing to go
when I went to college.

"A lapsed Catholic
is a good Catholic,"

or so they say.

A month after my mom died,
I went back.

It was the first time
I had been there in decades.

Mm, I sat there
trying to figure out

if I did it
'cause of faith...

if I just wanted
to feel her again.

-Did it work?
-Huh!

We're all alone, Samuel.

Do you think he did it?

My dad's
never lied to me before.

There's always a first time.

Is that why you're here?

I'm understandably
confused...

how-- how--

how a man
who worked so hard...

to forgive the man
that killed his wife...

who welcomed him
into the church...

and by all accounts...

tried to save his soul...

would suddenly kill him.

You have to ask him.

I did.

I didn't believe
the lie he told me.

If you know something
different than what he said...

it is your moral obligation
to do something.

He loves you...

you know that.

A lot.

He's being
arraigned tomorrow.

I, uh...

I wanted you to know.

<i>â™ª Amazing grace â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How sweet the sound â™ª</i>

That saved a wretch.

<i>â™ª That saved â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A wretch like me â™ª</i>

I once was lost.

<i>â™ª I once was lost â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But now am found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Was blind â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But now I see â™ª</i>

Amen!
