I KNOW, BUT THEY

WHAT CAN I DO ?

CORPORATE PROMISED THAT WHEN

IT WOULD EASE OUR WORKLOAD.

THIS IS NOT FAIR.LIFE'S NOT FAIR,

NOTHING YET.WHAT'S THE HOLDUP ?

SCARF IT DOWN AND SUIT UP.

<i>GIVE YOU AN EXTRA FIVE MINUTES <i>

[ Static, Beeping ]

JOHN, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

MURDOCH.

I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE, JOHN,
SO I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT.

THIS IS LIEUTENANT COLONEL
CALDECOTT...

<i>FROM THE PENTAGON'S <i>
SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISION.</i></i>

MR. RUSSELL.

<i>[ Murdoch ] <i>
THE COLONEL IS HEADING UP TO <i>
THE COMPOUND FOR AN INSPECTION.</i></i></i>

<i>HIS SHUTTLE LEAVES <i>
WITHIN THE HOUR.</i></i>

I'M SENDING KRUTCHFIELD
ALONG TO ASSIST.

WHEN DID THE MILITARY START
 INSPECTING GARBAGE DUMPS ?
WE DON'T.

S.O.D.'S HANDLING THIS
AT THE REQUEST OF THE SENATE
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

<i>WHY'S THAT ?</i>

JOHN, JUST BE A SPORT
AND GO ALONG WITH IT, OKAY ?

NOW, I KNOW
YOU CAN DO THAT.

WE'LL BE GOING DARK
UP HERE PRETTY SOON.

YOU MIGHT WANNA WAIT
FOR NEXT DAYLIGHT.

<i>[ Caldecott ] <i>
WHEN'S THAT ?</i></i>

<i>NEXT LIGHT IS IN 14 DAYS.</i>

THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
WE'LL PROCEED AS PLANNED.

YEAH, ALL RIGHT.WE'LL BE
WAITING FOR YOU.

FINE, FINE. NOW JOHN,
IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE--

COME ON !

<i>ASK ABOUT MY TRANSFER.</i>[ Whispering ]
DECKERT.

UH, YEAH, WE HAVE
A TRANSFER REQUEST PENDING.
NAME IS DECKERT.

OH, YES.
MR. DECKERT'S REQUEST
HAS BEEN DENIED.

WHY'S THAT ?

OH, WE FEEL HE'S DOING FINE
JUST WHERE HE IS.

GOOD-BYE, JOHN.

<i>WHAT ?</i>

ALL RIGHT, YOU TELL THAT MURDOCH
HE CAN COME UP HERE
AND KISS MY LUNAR BUTT !

<i>THIS IS BULL !</i>

TOOK THAT WELL.

DANA LOOKED GOOD.

I DIDN'T NOTICE.

YEAH, I NOTICED
HOW YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

IT'S IN THE PAST.
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT.

LAST TIME YOU LOOKED
THAT STUNNED WAS WHEN I DRUG YOU
IN OFF THE SURFACE HALF DEAD.

DON'T START
WITH ME, WILL.

HOW CAN I START WITH YOU ?

<i>YOU STILL HAVEN'T</i><i>
FINISHED WITH HER.</i>

YOU'RE SURE JOHN RUSSELL'S
PRESENCE WON'T CAUSE
ANY COMPLICATIONS ?

JOHN KNOWS
HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED.

HE WON'T GET
IN YOUR WAY.YOU'RE SURE ?

COLONEL, I KNOW HOW
TO PLAY JOHN RUSSELL.
HE'LL KEEP TO HIMSELF.

TRUST ME, JOHN KNOWS THE SCORE.
HE WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

MAYBE. HE'S HAD QUITE SOME TIME
TO RECONSIDER HIS POSITION.

HE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN
WHAT PUT HIM UP THERE.

WELL, THEN MAYBE
HE NEEDS A REMINDER.

MISS MORGAN, I'VE READ
YOUR BACKGROUND.
I'M IMPRESSED.

I'VE READ YOURS AND I'M NOT.IT WASN'T MEANT
TO IMPRESS YOU.

OR INFORM ME.IT'S A SENSITIVE
SITUATION.

THE DISKS WERE MARKED FOR
DESTRUCTION, NOT DISPOSAL.

YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S ON THEM. YOU JUST
NEED TO HELP ME FIND THEM.

EXCUSE ME ?THERE'S BEEN
A CHANGE IN PLANS.

YOU'LL BE ACCOMPANYING ME
ON THE SHUTTLE.MURDOCH ASSIGNED KRUTCHFIELD.

AND I REQUESTED
YOU INSTEAD.

YOU CO-DESIGNED THE
COMPOUND'S COMPUTER SYSTEM,

AND I BELIEVE YOUR
PAST ASSOCIATION WITH
JOHN RUSSELL COULD BE USEFUL.

PAST ASSOCIATION ?ON THE TEAM THAT OVERSAW
WTI'S ARCTIC PLANT.

THAT WAS OVER FIVE YEARS AGO.
IT WASN'T EXACTLY A SUCCESS.

BUT YOU SURVIVED
THE CORPORATE AFTERMATH.

I WAS ASSURED
YOU WERE A TEAM PLAYER.

IS YOURS.

FINE.

WHAT HIS FIRST WORDS WERE
WHEN HE STEPPED ON THIS ROCK.

"CONGRATULATIONS, MR. GORSKY."

WHO'S MR. GORSKY ?EXACTLY.

STORY ?

NOTHIN', REALLY.

<i>AND LEAVE THE LUNAR CHITCHAT <i>

HA !

[ Engine Revving ]

<i>[ Will ]</i><i>
HEY, LUCAS, HOW YA DOIN' ?</i>

ALL RIGHT, I GUESS. <i>JUST SETTLE DOWN</i><i>
AND RELAX...</i>

<i>WHILE I FINISH TELLING YOU</i><i>
THE ARMSTRONG STORY.</i>

OKAY.HIS FIRST WORDS WERE,
"CONGRATULATIONS, MR. GORSKY."

<i>RIGHT.</i>A LOT OF THEORIES POPPED UP
ABOUT WHAT ARMSTRONG MEANT,

LIKE MAYBE HE SAW SOMETHING
UP HERE THAT PROVED
THE RUSSIANS MADE IT FIRST,

OR THAT HE WAS
SOME KIND OF DOUBLE AGENT
SIGNALLIN' MOSCOW.

<i>FINALLY HE GETS SICK OF <i>
HEARIN' ABOUT IT, SO HE DECIDES <i>
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.</i></i></i>

<i>IT TURNS OUT <i>
WHEN HE WAS A KID,</i></i>

ARMSTRONG LIVED NEXT DOOR
TO AN OLDER COUPLE
NAMED GORSKY.

<i>SO ONE DAY</i><i>
HE WENT OVER THEIR YARD</i><i>
TO GET A STRAY BASEBALL,</i>

<i>AND HE HEARD A NOISE, <i>
AND THEN HE LOOKED <i>
IN THE WINDOW,</i></i></i>

<i>AND THERE WERE THE GORSKYS <i>
GOING AT IT ON THE BED.</i></i>

<i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

AND SUDDENLY MR. GORSKY STOPPED
 AND SAID TO HIS WIFE,

AFTER 30 YEARS OF GOOD LOVIN',
HE WANTED TO TRY
SOMETHIN' DIFFERENT.

<i>[ Chuckles ] <i>
WELL, MRS. GORSKY WAS SHOCKED.</i></i>

<i>HOW DARE HIM ASK HER <i>
TO DO SUCH A THING ?</i></i>

"DREAM ON,"
SHE SAID TO HIM.

<i>"THE DAY I PUT THAT THING <i>
IN MY MOUTH IS THE DAY <i>
THAT LITTLE ARMSTRONG BOY <i>

WHAT DO YOU THINK ?WHAT'S TO THINK ?
WE'RE SCREWED.

TAKE IT EASY.
WE'LL JUST GIVE 'EM
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

OKAY, MAYBE NOT.

CAN'T WE JUST

ALL I WANT IS TO GET BACK HOME.
I HAVE NO INTEREST

SO SIT QUIETLY,

IT'S ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF

THEY'D ASSUME THE READINGS

<i>INSTANT SUPERPOWER STATUS</i><i>

SIT TIGHT TILL WE GET BACK.
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT ?

MAN, THAT GUY'S GOT
A SERIOUS ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

<i>[ Caldecott ] <i>
CONTROL, WE ARE "GO" <i>
FOR SURFACE ACCESS.</i></i></i>

COPY THAT.
OPENING THE INNER HATCH.

WHAT DO WE DO NOW ?WE WAIT.

<i>
[ Caldecott ] REPEAT: <i>
WE ARE "GO" FOR ACCESS. <i>
HOW ABOUT THAT HATCH ?</i></i></i>

COLONEL, DO YOU MIND GIVIN' THAT
DOOR CONTROL PANEL DOWN THERE
A LITTLE WHACK ON THE SIDE ?

COLONEL ? <i>ROGER THAT, <i>
CONTROL.</i></i>

<i>A "WHACK ON THE SIDE."</i>

[ Engine Revving ]

SO, WHERE EXACTLY
IN B-TRENCH
ARE THEY HEADING ?

THE UNDERGROUND BUNKER
SHOULD BE IN SECTOR 56.

HMM.
FIFTY-SIX.

WHAT DID YOU MEAN, "ANOTHER"
SWEETHEART DEAL FOR MURDOCH ?

NOTHIN'.

JOHN, YOU NEVER MEAN NOTHING
WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING.

YEAH, WELL,

PEOPLE CHANGE.

WHAT ARE YOU HIDING ?

EVIDENTLY,
POSITRONIC PULSE WARHEADS.

IS HE ALWAYS
THIS CHEERY ?

ONLY ON
HIS GOOD DAYS.

<i>[ Engine Revving ]</i>

YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A BLUE SECTOR MARKER.

THE WARHEAD BUNKER
SHOULD BE 20 METERS FROM IT.

<i>[ Dana ] <i>
COORDINATES 156 <i>
AT 34 DEGREES.</i></i></i>

IT MUST BE COVERED.
WHO'S THE GENIUS WHO
FILLED THIS PLACE UP ?

WELL, COLONEL,
IT IS A DUMP, AFTER ALL.

<i>[ Caldecott ]</i><i>
THIS IS GONNA TAKE TIME.</i>HOW MUCH TIME ?

LONG ENOUGH TO GET SCREWED,
LIKE LUCAS AND SOPHIE.

THOSE GUYS
ARE STILL OUT THERE.

LOOK, WE'LL BE FINE
IF WE JUST STAY PUT.

I'M TOO OLD
TO STAY PUT.WILL--

<i>WE GOTTA GET OFF OUR BUTTS. <i>
WE GOTTA GET A DISTRESS <i>
SIGNAL OUTTA HERE.</i></i></i>

<i>NOW YOU'RE TALKIN' !</i>THERE'S A PLAN.

BUT WE CAN'T. WE'RE ON
THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON.

WITH THE RELAY STATION OFF-LINE,
THERE'S NO WAY TO BOUNCE
AND BOOST A SIGNAL TO EARTH.

SO WE CAN'T SEND A SIGNAL
AROUND THE MOON,

BUT WE CAN TRANSMIT
TO THE PRISON.

WE HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE
TO THEM.

THEN ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS AMPLIFY OUR SIGNAL
FROM IN HERE.

AND WHERE ARE WE GONNA
FIND AN AMP--

OH, NO, NO, NO.
NOT MY STEREO, MAN.

I SPENT THREE MONTHS' SALARY
ON THAT SYSTEM.

WILL, IT'S NOT SAFE OUT THERE.
IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.

THAT TOO.
I'LL GO.

SOMETIMES, JOHN, YOU GOTTA
LEARN TO TAKE THE RISK.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

LET'S DO IT.

I'M RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

HEY, HOW COME
YOU GET THE GUN ?

BECAUSE I'M OLDER AND WISER.
YOU COULD GET HURT.

HERE.

HEY, WAIT UP !

AND GIVE ME THOSE THINGS, MAN.
I CAN'T HAVE YOU AMATEURS
HACKIN' UP MY SYSTEM.

COME ON.

[ Unintelligible Dialogue ]

THEY GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

BUNKER.

<i>CODE ALPHA INPUT.</i>

[ Beeping ]

THIS IS IT.

LET'S PACK 'EM UP.

<i>[ Caldecott ] <i>
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE <i>

UNDERSTOOD.

SO,

YOU LOOK GOOD.

I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

WELL, FIVE YEARS ON
THE FAR SIDE TAKES ITS TOLL.

BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
THE PLACE DOES HAVE ITS CHARM.

OH, YEAH.

IT'S A REAL
VACATION PARADISE.

I CAN SEE WHY YOU
REQUESTED THE TRANSFER.

I WASN'T GIVEN
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

BUT I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT OKAY, THOUGH.

IT'S FOR THE BEST.
I MEAN, YOU MOVED UP
THE CORPORATE LADDER.

IT'S JUST, MY LADDER WENT
A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YOURS.

YOU LANDED YOURSELF HERE, JOHN.
I WORKED HARD
TO GET WHERE I'M AT.

I KNOW THAT.
THAT'S WHY--

WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET,
JOHN ?

THERE'S NO SECRET.

YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
AND YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT IT WAS.

I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS EASY
TO PICK OUT THE BAD GUY.

[ Masani ]
WE SHOULD PUT IN
FOR HAZARD PAY.

A BUNCH OF ARMED PSYCHOS
RUNNIN' AROUND
A NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

YEAH, I'D SAY
THAT'S HAZARDOUS.

DON'T TOUCH.

I'VE GOT THIS BABY
CHERRIED JUST SO.

I CAN'T HAVE YOU GUYS
YANKIN' WIRES OUT.

<i>YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE</i><i>
GONNA HAVE TIME FOR HER ?</i>

JUST CAN'T LEAVE HER HERE
ALL ALONE.

WILL.

I'LL STEP OUTSIDE,
KEEP AN EYE OUT. <i>GOOD IDEA.</i>

KIND OF COLD
IN HERE.

YOU SHOULD TRY LUNAR NIGHT
ON THE SURFACE.

YOU SHOULD TRY
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS.

ENOUGH TO
CHILL YOUR SPINE.

HOW LONG ARE YOU PLANNING
TO STAY UP HERE ?

LONG ENOUGH.

IT SUITS ME,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE.

I KNOW WHAT I SEE,
 I KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD,

BUT I GET THE SENSE
THERE'S MORE TO THE TRUTH.

THAT DEPENDS
ON WHO TELLS IT.

NO. IT DEPENDS
ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

WELL, YOU SAW WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED, DANA.

BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS
WIPED OUT HALF
THE ARCTIC COAST...

AFTER I FUDGED
THE PLANT SAFETY SPECS.

END OF STORY.
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH ?

THE TRUTH IS WHATEVER
GETS THE JOB DONE.

<i>DANA, DON'T WASTE</i><i>
YOUR TIME WONDERING.</i>

YOU'RE SMART.
LOOK OUT FOR
YOURSELF DOWN THERE.

WATCH YOUR OWN BACK.
THAT'S HOW YOU SURVIVE.

NO. THAT'S HOW YOU DIE.

IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS YOURSELF,
THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER HAVE.

HEY, THIS IS MY ROCK
IN THE UNIVERSE.

I DIDN'T MOVE UP
ALL THE WAY TO THE
FAR SIDE OF THE MOON...

HOPING YOU'D STOP BY
TO LECTURE ME.

OH, I SEE.

YOU TRANSFERRED TO THE MOON
TO GET AWAY FROM ME.
HOW ROMANTIC.

<i>[ Caldecott ] <i>

BUT YOU COULD TRY

[ Stark On Intercom ]
JOHN, I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

WE SHOULD DISCUSS
THE SITUATION,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

COME, NOW.
DON'T BE RUDE.

WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND ?

THOUGHTS YOU CAN'T
 EVEN IMAGINE.
JOHN ?

THIS IS A PRIVATE
CONVERSATION, MISS MORGAN.

AND A PRIVATE OFFER
TO MR. JOHN RUSSELL.

WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.
 IT'S WHAT I CAN GIVE YOU.

WHAT'S THAT ?
YOUR LIFE, IN EXCHANGE
 FOR THE SHUTTLE.

GIVE ME THE ACCESS CODE
TO THE CONTROL CENTER DOOR,

AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

WHAT ABOUT MY CREW
IN THERE ?

THAT SHOULDN'T
CONCERN YOU.

I'M OFFERING YOU
YOUR LIFE, NOT THEIRS.

IT'S SIMPLE REALLY.

GIVE ME MY FREEDOM,
AND YOU LIVE.

THERE'S NO NEED
TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LIVE IN A CAGE, JOHN ?

IT'S INVARIABLE.

YOU WAKE UP TO THE SAME BARS,
EAT THE SAME FOOD,

TAKE THE SAME CRAP
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME,
DAY AFTER DAY.

EVERY DAY.

THE THING IS,

IT'S NOT PAINFUL
MOMENT TO MOMENT.

IT'S ALL THE TOMORROWS
THAT WILL KILL YOU.

BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, 
DON'T YOU, JOHN ?

WE'RE THE SAME,
YOU AND I.

TWO SOCIAL OUTCASTS
SENT AWAY TO LIVE...

AMONGST THE WORLD'S

BUT TELL ME, JOHN.

WHO IS THE REAL PRISONER ?

I BROKE OUT

SO WHY DON'T WE TRY

ARE REALLY MOTIVATED.

THAT YOUR RELAY STATION
COMES BACK ON-LINE.

IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE.

NOT ONE LABEL TO EXPLAIN THAT
MOLECULAR ANNIHILATION...

COULD BE HAZARDOUS

KILLED YOURSELF, STARK.

AGAIN, YOU UNDERESTIMATE ME,

AND ONCE AGAIN,
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

WAIT, WAIT ! Y-YOU NEED ME.
MANNING THE SHUTTLE
IS COMPLICATED.

TELL HIM, RUSSELL.
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
THE GARBAGE TRANSPORT FROM L4.

L4, THAT'S IT.
 DECKERT JUST SAVED US.
WHAT ?

WE STILL GOT A DIRECT LINE
TO THE PRISON, RIGHT ?

WE DON'T NEED THE RELAY STATION
IF WE CAN PIGGYBACK

<i>ON OUR COM SIGNAL.</i>

NOT ENOUGH SIGNAL STRENGTH.
WE FORGOT TO REROUTE
YOUR AMP POWER.

HE IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN GET US
OFF THE SURFACE.

BUT IF YOU KILL HIM,
WE'RE ALL DEAD.

IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

[ Clicking ]
[ Stark ]
 A VERY NOBLE ATTEMPT, JOHN.

EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
THIS TRAITOR'S DONE,
YOU STILL HOPE TO SAVE HIM.

BUT HE'S MY PARTNER NOW,
NOT YOURS.

CONSIDER OUR ARRANGEMENT
RENEGOTIATED.

[ Gunshot, Signal Buzzing ]

<i>[ Beep ]</i>HE DID IT !

DE-PRESSURIZE THE BAY
AND OPEN THE SHUTTLE BAY DOORS.

WE ARE OUT OF HERE !WE HAVE SIGNAL LOCK WITH L4.

<i>[ Beeping ]</i>PROBLEM.

TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.THE BAY DOORS WON'T OPEN.

<i>DECKERT MUST HAVE SIPHONED POWER <i>
FROM THE BASE GENERATOR...</i></i>

THE TRANSPORT SHIP.WE'RE SCREWED.

NO, NO, NO. WE JUST NEED
TO REDIRECT THE TRACTOR BEAM
POWER TO THE BAY DOORS.

BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE
FROM THE CONTROL BOX

HA, NO-NO-NO, MAN.
NO WAY I'M GOING
OUT THERE.

TWENTY MINUTES.

YOU CAN'T. YOU'LL NEVER
MAKE IT THERE AND BACK

I KNOW YOU--YOU DO KNOW ME, DANA.

YOU ALWAYS HAVE. YOU JUST
LOST SIGHT OF ME UP HERE.

WILL.

YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME,
YOU KNOW. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO RUN AWAY TO THE MOON.

YES, I DID.
MOONBASE WAS THE DEAL.

PERMANENT TRANSFER.
I DIDN'T LIKE THE OTHER OPTION.

IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT, FOR YOU--
