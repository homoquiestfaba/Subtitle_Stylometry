<i>Legends tell that in the
midst of the 15th century</i>

<i>the wickedest of dragons
blackened the skies</i>

<i>across southern England
with his reign of terror.</i>

<i>His name was Yuto.</i>

<i>This continued until the
brave Sir Arthur Miller</i>

<i>slayed Yuto,</i>
the last of his kind...

<i>...finally bringing peace
to the land.</i>

<i>Death, however,</i>

<i>could not constrain
this powerful beast,</i>

<i>and, with the help
of an evil wizard,</i>

<i>his ghost passed back
into our world.</i>

<i>"Seek out your slayer's
offspring,"</i>

<i>the wizard told
the ghost dragon.</i>

<i>"Capture their life force
within this diamond.</i>

<i>A male and a female,
no more than 50 years apart.</i>

<i>Repeat this cycle
for five centuries,</i>

<i>and your own life force
shall be restored."</i>

<i>And so, for 500 years,</i>

<i>this is just
what Yuto has done...</i>

<i>Terrorize the offspring
of Sir Arthur Miller</i>

<i>in order to once again become
a living and breathing dragon.</i>

Sorry, Yuto!
But it ends here!

I'm afraid it's you
who ends here.

I won't let you
trap any more souls!

What? No!

I don't know how you escaped...

but you will get
back in the box.

Foolish boy!

There is no hope
without the light knife.

The what?
Yes!

The only thing that can
destroy the diamond

and set the life force free.

I probably shouldn't
have said that.

Where is it?
Hidden away,

where only a member of
your bloodline could ever find it.

I shouldn't have
said that, either.

No matter.

Even if you manage
to escape that box again.

You'll forever be tied
to the realm between worlds.

Into the realm
of shadow and fear,

bind your spirit to the mirror.

I'm sorry, Abigail!

Winston Miller, the owner

and final surviving heir
of Echoville Manor,

passed away this evening.

Mr. Miller was jailed in 1970

when his great nephew
William disappeared

under suspicious circumstances

which remain unsolved
to this day.

<i>William was only seven years old</i>

<i>when he was last seen
on the property by a butler.</i>

<i>And even after extensive
and wide-ranging searches,</i>

<i>his remains were never found.</i>

<i>Despite insisting on being
overseas at the time,</i>

<i>Mr. Miller was accused
of foul play.</i>

<i>Elderly locals here
in Messina Falls</i>

<i>still recall the shocking incident
in their sleepy hollow town.</i>

<i>But for most people,</i>

<i>it's a forgotten footnote
in time.</i>

<i>Winston Miller is said to have
no known surviving relatives,</i>

<i>so the manor will revert
to local banking authorities,</i>

<i>should no one come forward.</i>

<i>This is Summer Randall,
News Channel 3. Back to you.</i>

Is that the last of it
from the market store?

Yeah.

Shame that we have
to shut it down...

because your mom would never
have let that happen.

Here. Thanks.

Hmm...

Hmm.
Power's cut, too.

Well...

Then we'll just have
to eat all that ice cream

before it melts.

Yeah?
Sounds like a plan.

Let's go.

I think it's about time we put
those first editions up for sale.

Mm, no. I don't think
you should do that.

What's the point
of collecting them

if they're worthless
when you need them?

I'd feel...

I don't know.

We'll get through it.

We've gotten through worse.

You sound like your mom.

Now you sound like me.

Okay.

Uh-uh, I'll do it.

Thank you.

Remember what your mom
always said?

Tomorrow's not today.
Right.

Good night.
Good night, Dad.

Good night, Mama.

<i>Elizabeth.
Come to the door.</i>

<i>Come to the door.
Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

<i>Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

<i>Come to the door.</i>

<i>Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

<i>Come to the door.</i>

<i>Elizabeth. Come to the door.</i>

Hello?

<i>Come to the door, Elizabeth.</i>

Hello?

Was that someone at the door?

This was pinned to the door.

"EM"?

"Dear Abigail...

We regret to inform you

that your great uncle Winston
Miller has passed away."

I did not know
Mom had a great uncle.

Hmm.

"After much investigation,

you have been found to be
his final surviving relative.

As such, you are now
the sole heir

to Echoville Manor
in Messina Falls,

which has been in
your family since 1685."

Hmm. These pictures
say 1965.

A mansion?!

"The custodian Juan Sanchez
to meet you

to hand over the keys
in the coming days."

And then it's just signed "EM"?

Is this real?

I mean...
I think it's real.

You know,
we could sell this place

and then have enough money
to pay back the bank.

And I could reopen my shop.

I don't know.

This place has been
in mom's family for like...

ever.

Fair point.

How about we sleep on it?
Okay.

Good night.
See you in the morning.

Dad.
Hmm.

Dad.
Hmm.

Dad, wake up. Wake up.
Hmm.

I think we should
go check out Echoville.

And then we can
decide what to do.

Mm.

When do you wanna go?

No time like the present.

I've just been looking up what I can
about the manor. There's not much.

A few blogs, but they
just say that it's haunted.

Boo!

Dad, please.

You don't believe
that hogwash, do you?

Of course not.

Good girl.

So, um, I've been thinking

about our options
once we get there.

Okay.

So, we can just move
right into Echo House.

Echoville.

Echoville, and make it our own.

Of course, we might
get a little lonely

with all those empty rooms.

Maybe we could Airbnb them.
We could.

Or...

I could turn it
into a recording studio

and invite artists
from all over the world

to come and record their albums,

and we could feed them,
and we could accommodate...

And what happens when summer's
finished and I go back to school?

Or we could just not
get ahead of ourselves.

Uh, okay, so option B is
that we put it on the market,

because I feel that
we could make enough money

to pay off the vultures
at the bank,

and then have enough
left over to start a new life.

You're not sold
on selling, are you?

No, it's just...

I wish Mom were here.

She's always with us.

You sure you don't
wanna come with?

Just gonna take a look around.

Okay.
But don't get lost.

Hey, come back here!

You can run, but you can't hide!

You can't ride forever.

Come back with that owl!

Get back, you jerk!

Out of the way!

Watch out!

Happy Birthday!

Lizzy.
You ready?

I'm so sorry.

Are you okay?
Nothing we can't resolve in court.

Hey! Hey!
Get back here!

Later.

Let's go.

Echoville Manor.

Hope the house is in
better shape than the sign.

Uh.

Hmm. No.

Hmm. No, no, no.

Hmm?

It's a lot bigger
than I thought it would be.

The picture doesn't
even do it justice.

It is a lot of work
for just one man.

Oh, sorry, folks.

I'm Juan Sanchez, the
custodian here at Echoville Manor.

Oh, I'm James Oren.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

And you must be Abigail.

I'm Elizabeth, her daughter.

Okay. So where is Abigail?

Hmm. Who's this?

Welcome to Echoville Manor.

Wow.

You can say that again.

Wow.

The manor was
originally built in the 1500s.

Then after, Joseph Miller,

your great-great-great-great-
great grandfather,

shipped the building here
to Messina Falls

brick by brick in the 1800s.

Why?

Legend has it that it was
to get far away from a ghost.

However, it didn't really
help the situation

that they rebuilt it on an
ancient druid burial site.

I'm joking.

So, what are your plans?

We thought that we would move
in and stay here a few weeks,

and, you know, maybe
clean the place up a little

and figure it out from there.

Well, I am on hand to help you
with whatever you need.

Um, well,
thank you, Mr. Sanchez.

Juan, please.
Juan.

But we're... we're really
not in a position

to pay someone right now.

Oh, no. Did you not
read the whole letter?

The estate covers my services.

Are you serious?
That's awesome. What?

It is my pleasure. Why
don't you take a look around?

I still have some work to do
on the roof before it gets dark.

Okay. Thanks.

Okay.

Hey, race you
to find the best room.

You're on.

Ready?

Three, two...

Hey! Cheater!

I found my room!

Me too.

Mirror, mirror on the wall...

Floor.

Who's the fairest of them all?

It's Elizabeth, you knucklehead.

Hey, I'm gonna go get
the bags out of the car.

I'll be down in a sec.

What? What?
What is it?

I...

It was a... a spider.

A spider?

Was it the size of a cat?

At least.

Well, uh, I think you
scared it away,

as well as anything else
in a 10-mile radius,

so, um, you're gonna help me
with those bags?

Oh.
Here, let me get that for you.

This looks fun.

I love puzzles.

She's my little puzzle princess.

You are.

I'm Connie. I live
right across the way.

Hi, I'm James Oren.

And this is my
daughter, Elizabeth.

Hello.

Can I help with anything?

You could get the door.
Oh, sure.

What was that?

Okay.

I'll just take these upstairs.
Yeah.

So you just live
across the road.

With... with your husband?

Oh, no.

Boyfriend? Girlfriend?

It's just me, I'm afraid.

Yeah.

They do say it's 13 years bad
luck to move into a new house

and then stare
into the mirrors right away.

Oh, I...

Do they?

Dates back to King Henry VIII's
reign in England, 150...

1509 to 1547.

Wow.

Well, you know your stuff.

My Mom, she was a bit
of an English history buff,

so kind of rubbed off.

That's lovely.

So I guess you already
know, then,

that the residents in those days

deemed it bad luck
to move into a new house

that didn't already have
its mirrors covered up.

Really?
Oh, yes.

It was considered
extremely unlucky.

But you know, those are
old wives' tales.

You never know
which ones to believe in

and which ones not to, right?

He's a cutie.

Oh, that's... Arthur.

It's silly.

That's your mom?
Yeah.

She's beautiful.

You have her eyes.

Gosh, I'm so sorry.

I get so nosey sometimes.

Just tell me to stop.

It's okay.

So, how long should
we keep them covered?

So that we avoid the bad luck?

Oh, they say at least a week.

Should we go cover the others?

There you go.

That's it.

<i>Elizabeth, don't be scared.</i>

<i>Over here. Hello.</i>

<i>Come to the mirror.
Elizabeth.</i>

Hello?

Afternoon.
Is your father in?

Dad!

Mr. Alessi.

How did you...

We have ways to track people.

Um, well, would you like
to go in the study?

No, I'll be brief.

Seems you've come
upon a windfall.

Well...

It's not so much me as
it is my late wife's family.

Again, my condolences.

However, I'm here to inform you

that based on the contract
that you signed with us,

any inheritance that you befell

can be seized
to cover your debts.

And I understand that.

We're going to fix the place up

and sell it to get
the money to pay you,

with interest, of course,

but... it takes time
to get these things ready.

You... you understand?

Despite what you might
think of me, Mr. Oren,

I am not an unreasonable man.

So here's what I'll do.

I'll give you a month
to fix this place up,

find a buyer,
whatever you need to do.

Yes. Thank you.

However, if this place
has not sold after a month,

A squid Savings and Loan

will seize this place
in its entirety

to cover our agreement.

But I mean, you can't just...

Or we can seize it today.

Very well.

Shall we say, stroke of
midday after 28 days?

Yes.

And thank you, sincerely.

Good day.

Well...

we better get busy.

Only a month? Hmm.

I hope that's enough time.

I don't know, Clarence.

The things these kids
post out on them InnerTubes,

oh, boy, I do not get that.

Yes, sir.

Well, howdy, folks.

Just this lot?
Uh-huh.

Oh, with...

All right. Thank you.

I haven't seen you folks
around these parts.

Passing through?

Not exactly.

We're just doing some renovations
on a house that we inherited.

Oh, very nice.

Well, now that you know
where we are,

you can keep that paint flowing.

Yes, sir.

Oh, looks like 57.92.

Thank you.

Which part of town
is the property?

Happy to lend a hand.

Well, that's very nice.
It's...

Actually, it's Echoville Manor.

Thanks for shopping at Nix.

Did I say something
to offend him?

Next.

Here, let me help with
that paint. Thank you.

Whoa!

The BMX bandit returns.
Sorry again about yesterday.

Aren't you the people
moving into Echoville Manor?

Yeah.

Um, hey, why did the guys inside

have such a problem with that?

People around here, especially
the older ones, think it's haunted.

Boy disappeared there many
years ago. Hasn't been lived in since.

How do you know that?
I'm a bit of a ghost story nerd.

Plus my father's the custodian.

Oh, Juan is your father.

Yeah. These...
are for him.

Um, here, let's...

Let's give you a... a ride back.

Thank you.
How about that?

Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
Thank you.

Okay, get all the...

Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

I have your owl statue.

Actually, it belongs to you.

Well, to Echoville.

I was getting it back
after those two took it.

Oh. What's so special
about it?

There's a key inside.

I don't know what it opens, but I
couldn't let those two just take it.

Well, thank you, then, I guess.

Do you want to stay for tea?

Oh, I don't really drink it.
Oh, no.

Sorry, it's what my Mum...
Mom... used to call dinner.

She was English.

Never mind.
Just come on.

<i>Now don't be scared, okay?</i>

But you cannot sell the...

Um, not again.

What?

I... it... The tap.

I don't see anything.

Sorry, it was the...
Uh, it was a... a spider.

Another spider.
Oh.

It's a big house, honey.

We're probably gonna
have a few roommates.

I can spray the house tomorrow.

Yeah.

You okay?
Uh, yeah.

Just gave me a scare.
I'll be fine.

These will be ready soon.

Thank you. It was delicious.
Thank you.

Bye, Mateo.
Thanks again. See you tomorrow.

Now is my chance.

Okay, Baron Zumati.

Forces ain't gonna
stop me tonight.

<i>Software update complete.</i>

Update?

Wonder what they've added.

Okay, where are you, ghouls?

I need to speak with you.

What? They can talk now?

This software update is sweet.

Could you stop that, please?

It's like I can
actually touch them.

This update is wild!

Enough with the poking!
I need your help.

Now, if I might...

Not again!

What's going on in there?

Nothing.
Just this game.

I got scared by the game.

Keep it down
or I'll take it away.

Okay.

I need you to remain calm.

Are you gonna hurt me?

No. I just need
to talk to you.

I need your help.

Who are you?

It's not important.

Just call me Ghoster for now.

Why are you here?

I jumped into the mirror
on your bike at Echoville.

The place really <i>is</i> haunted.

Wait, does this mean my
house is haunted now too?

Oh, man!
Dad's gonna kill me.

He just remodeled the kitchen.

This house isn't haunted.

At least, I don't think so.

But listen, this is important.

You can't let the Orens sell Echoville Manor.
Why?

Because I've been
trapped there for 50 years

when an evil ghost dragon
called Yuto imprisoned me

when I tried to destroy
a diamond he hid at Big Ben.

So, he tied me to the realms
between your world and mine

by trapping me in mirrors with
a curse which can't be broken

unless I get the light knife
by outsmarting him.

Come again?

I've been trapped...
Right.

...by an evil force...
Got it.

...when I tried to steal his diamond...
Okay.

...from Big Ben.
Mm-hmm.

I need to best him...
Oh.

...and get the light knife...
Getting it.

...to be released from the mirrors...
Got you.

...so I can destroy
his diamond.

Okie-dokie.
Just one more thing.

It's some kind of hidden
camera show, isn't it?

Okay, Aaron.
You can come out now.

You got me.

How are they doing this?

This is a projection
or something?

This is not a joke!

So you're really real.

I assure you, I am.

But how can I help?

I need your help
to talk to Elizabeth.

Every time she sees me,
she screams.

It's really quite annoying.

Okay, but why do you
need her help?

Well, here's the thing.

Whoa, hey.

Hi, Mr. Oren. Is Elizabeth in?
Yes.

Lizzie?
Mateo's here.

She's in the kitchen.

Hey.
Hi.

What's up?

Do you know about
<i>DÃ­a de los Muertos?</i>

The Day of the Dead.
Yeah, a little bit. Why?

We believe that death is
just part of the journey of life,

and that rather than death
ending life,

new life comes from death.

It's a nice way to look at it.

Exactly. There's
dancing and feasts,

and it gives us
a bit of relationship

with what happens after death.
Right.

So that when things occur,
which would usually seem strange,

they're actually not so strange.

You mean strange like
how you're being now?

No, I mean, yes.

I'm being strange, but with good reason.
Hope so.

What I'm really
trying to say is...

Oh, just spit it out, will you?

That went a lot smoother when
we practiced it last night, Mateo.

That? You... it's...
Elizabeth.

Elizabeth, meet...

Ghoster.

I'm sorry to have frightened you

when I tried to introduce
myself before.

Mm... mm?

Right.

Now that's out of the way,
let's get down to business.

I need your help.

You'd better stay calm for this.

This is pretty wild.

Okay, so first things first.

You can't sell this manor.

Why?
Say it slowly.

We need to wait
until the next full moon,

so that the doorway to the
chamber in the basement will appear.

Why? What happens there?

We have to pass the
extremely dangerous challenges

and retrieve
the light knife from Yuto.

That's the only time
we can do it.

But the good news is that the
next full moon is in three weeks.

Friday the 13th.
Oh, spooky.

Well, I guess that's ominous.

So what's the knife light
and what is a Yuto?

You're forgetting the
extremely dangerous challenges.

How could I?
It's light knife.

And Yuto is a ghost dragon,

and for centuries, in an
effort to achieve being reborn,

he steals the souls
of children in my family,

which he encases
within his diamond.

Which is in the bell tower
of Big Ben in London.

Yes, I know where Big Ben is.

Except it's not
in the real London,

but in a painting of it.
Only...

We don't know
where the painting is.

Uh-huh.

Yes, it was hanging
in the house,

but after the last time I entered
to try and destroy the diamond,

someone took it down.

Look, I don't have time
for this...

nonsense.

I have so much work to do to
help my dad fix up the manor,

so I wish you both luck with...

this.

Please, I can't do it
without you.

Looks like it's
just us men, Ghoster.

No offense, Mateo,

but we're going to need
all the brain power we can get

to pass the extremely
dangerous challenges.

We went over this.

Right.

She's the brains.
I'm the brawn.

Exactly.

At least, Yuto told me
where the light knife is.

He told you how to defeat him?

Doesn't seem like the smartest
ghost dragon, does he?

You might change your mind

after you see
the first challenge.

Yeah, there's a good chance
we might get squished.

I'm not gonna be able
to squish this.

You're not doing a very
good job of convincing me.

Please, Elizabeth!
This isn't just for me.

It's for all the lost souls
trapped in Yuto's diamond.

They're my family.

I don't know. I can't
disappoint my Dad.

Hold on.

You have three and a half
weeks to sell the manor, right?

So that means we have time
to help Ghoster

and still fix this place up.

If, and that's a big if,

but <i>if</i> I agree to help,

you two both have to work
double time to help me and my dad

get this place ready to sell.

Deal.
Right.

Where should we start?

Great work, team.
Only 27 more rooms to go.

Hey, Anita.

Yeah, that's fine.

Show him in. See if he
wants some refreshments.

Okay.

Mr. Lee.

Take a seat.
Thank you.

Time is of the essence,
so I will be prompt.

I represent a powerful client.

We are looking for the instant
acquisition of land in Messina Falls.

Now, our reasoning
is... confidential.

But I assure you that
our urgency is paramount.

Great, I'll put you in contact with
somebody on our business team.

We're actually interested
in a very particular site.

Echoville Manor.

As far as I understand, you
are in the process of acquiring it?

Working on the paperwork
right now.

But you know these things take
time, so I'm sure we'll have it done...

We need you to speed up
the process.

We expect to break ground
in two weeks, Mr. Alessi.

Good day.

So let me get this straight.

Yuto, a ghost dragon,

trapped your life force
in a diamond

that's hidden
in a painting of London.

But you have no idea where
this painting of London is.

No, but even if I did,

I still need the light knife
to break the diamond within it.

I learned that the hard way
the last time I escaped

and Yuto caught me
in the painting.

That's when he tied me
to the mirrors.

If you're tied
to the mirrors at Echoville,

how were you able
to get to Mateo's house?

If one mirror passes
another, I can jump into it.

So you can
jump into this mirror?

I can!

Who's that?

My Mom.
She's beautiful.

She passed away a while ago.

I'm so sorry.

Hey, Ghoster,
are there others like you?

You mean ghosts?

A few, but we're not
all connected.

I wouldn't be able
to track her down,

if that's what you're asking.

Oh.

So how did you end up here?

Well, I was little.

Seven, I think,

so my memories
aren't that great.

My parents, they passed away.

I was sent to live here.

I was terrified,

so I would hide most days.

One day I went
to the cellar to hide...

and I never came back.

Then what happened?

It's a blur.

I was pulled into something,

like a fly caught
in a spider web.

So you had no family?

I had a baby sister,
barely six months.

But she passed away, too.

That's so sad.
I'm sorry.

It's quite all right.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

So the cellar,
what's down there?

The owl painting.

It's like the painting
of London with one difference.

You need a key to pass into it.

There, that's the one.

I don't understand.

How does the key
work with the painting?

Only during the full moon
will the door be revealed.

If we have the key,

we'll be able
to enter the painting.

That's where the challenges are.

What do you know about them?

Only that I can't
pass them alone.

It will take teamwork
and, honestly, a little luck.

There's puzzles and traps
that, let's just say,

there's a chance that you could...
What?

End up like me.

Okay.

We just need to know
how to beat the challenges.

I wish I knew more.

But the information within the
four walls of Echoville is limited.

Believe me, I've gone
through every book here.

And I know just where to look.

Come on.
Let's head into town.

Wi-Fi in this place is terrible.

Wi-Fi?

Uh... I think
you missed a spot.

And I think you didn't.

You are covered
from head to toe.

I think that that chimney has
soot in it from the dawn of time.

Mm-hmm.

It sure is a shame
you have to sell the place.

I wish there was another way...

because there is
so much history here.

As a child, that was
my favorite painting.

As a child?

I... I thought this place had
been abandoned for 50 years?

Um...
Going into town for some air.

Oh, hey, we need
some more white paint!

And... sandpaper.

Sure, Dad.

And ice cream.

So let me get this right.

Everyone now has a device
in their pockets

that has the answer
to literally every question

that any person has ever
asked in the history of time.

And they mostly use them
to look at cat pictures?

Well, not every question.

I can't find anything
about Yuto.

Well, we just have
to keep looking.

Hey.
Hey.

Lizzie, um, have a seat.

"Due to your failure to submit

the supporting documentation
within the allotted time,

all property,
including Echoville Manor,

will be seized
within seven days."

They can't!
He gave you his word!

Unfortunately, these vultures
can do whatever they want.

They don't care
about people like us.

We have to do something.

We can't, Lizzie.

We must!

Dad, you don't understand!
We can't let them take it!

At least, now just now.

We have to fight for the next...

eleven days.

Eleven?

Then what happens?

Then what happens?

<i>The doorway
to defeat Yuto will open.</i>

Who said that?

Dad.

Dad.

Dad!
What?

Remember how you said
you didn't believe in ghosts?

Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Oren.

Oh!
Dad!

Well, that went as well
as it could.

So that's why we need
just a little more time.

And once we do all that,

then you can
let them have the house.

You know,
this... is crazy.

But your mom wouldn't have
let us just give up without a fight.

So you're in?

I'm in.

One, two, three!

Go team!
Okay.

So, now what?

I've got just the thing.

When I was in college,
I was the Halloween king.

This should buy us some time.

You need a hand?

We're doing research, actually.

Ooh, fun.
What for?

For the Scare Squad.

Scare Squad?
What's that?

The bank broke
its promise to dad,

and it's trying to repossess
Echoville before we can sell it.

Oh, no.

When are they coming?
As early as tomorrow.

So before Friday the 13th.
Exactly.

Well, is the Scare Squad
recruiting?

Do you want to join?

Well, I can't just sit
around and do nothing

and let them kick you out
without a chance to sell the place.

Welcome the newest member
of the Scare Squad, Connie.

Oh, and I should probably
introduce you to Ghoster.

Hello.
How do you do?

Oh.

Hello.

Hello!

We're here from the bank
to repossess the property.

Mr. Oren!

Come on.

Mr. Oren.

Hello.

Boo.

Mr. Oren.

It's time to leave.

We could do this the easy way
or the not so fun way.

Do you have to check
yourself in every mirror?

I want to suck your blood!

<i>Let me guess.</i>

You got frightened away
by ghosts.

You know, yours is the 10th team

to come back saying
that that place is haunted.

But I know it's not.

Come here.

So they want to play games.

It looks like I'll be
paying them another visit.

Mr. Alessi,
what can we do for you?

What's this about my men being
scared away each time I send 'em?

Uh, I don't know.

They come in here just fine,

but then they all
leave in a hurry.

Every single one of 'em
coming back saying

that this place is haunted.

Haunted? Echoville?

I think they're
pulling your leg.

You're welcome to go in
and see for yourself.

Yeah, I think I will.

Would you like us
to show you around?

No. That won't be
necessary.

Knock yourself out.

Let's see if this place
really is haunted.

Haunted my...

This is crazy.

This place isn't haunted at all.

Tried to tell you that.

Just have your stuff packed
and ready to go by tomorrow.

No more excuses.
No games.

This is Alessi.

My client is growing
impatient, Mr. Alessi.

Why have you not acquired
Echoville Manor yet?

Minor details, Mr. Lee. But I
can assure you,

I will have the manor in my
possession by this time tomorrow.

We paid you a considerable sum

to make sure
that this went smoothly.

We do not like it when
things do not go smoothly.

<i>And I appreciate that.</i>

Just give me a final 24 hours

and then you and the Golden Dragon
Corporation can commence demolition.

Golden Dragon?

Yuto!

What'd you say?

I didn't say anything.

No, just now, you...
You said Yuto.

<i>Yuto?</i>

I have no idea
what you're talking about,

you strange little man.

<i>But you have 24 hours
and not a second more!</i>

Otherwise, we will be
forced to reclaim

our generous little offer...
with interest.

Guys, it's Yuto!

That's why the bank
is kicking you out.

So he can destroy the mansion,
trapping me in here forever.

How do you know?

I heard him say the name
of the company who wants it...

The Golden Dragon Corporation.

Dragon!

Yuto is a ghost dragon?

So, Dad,

you might be wondering why
there is a ghost talking to us,

so don't be scared, but...

Me? Scared?

Ghoster and I go way back.

You do?
Sure!

I even tried to help him
escape on the last full moon.

But we didn't get far out.

Couldn't figure out
the first challenge.

But we never told you, because
we thought you'd freak out.

Why would I freak out?

Ghoster's one of the last
living owners of Echoville.

He was?

Yes, my great uncle owned it,

but they locked him up when they
thought that he had caused me harm.

But it wasn't him!
It was Yuto!

And I've been trapped
here ever since.

Wait, if your great uncle
is my mom's great uncle too...

Does that make you...

my uncle?

But I was told my sister
died with my parents.

And Abigail was told
that she was sent away

to live with her great
grandmother to protect her.

I... I have a family.

Well, I guess that means when,
or if you beat the...

Yeah, what's his name again?

Yuto.

Him, if you beat him,

this manor reverts to you,
as the living heir.

What do you mean,
living heir? I'm dead!

Well, I mean, if you free
your life force,

you could come back to life.

Or not.

Uh, I probably said
too much there.

I don't think it works that way.

Once the life forces are freed,

we will all be reunited with
the rest of our departed families

in the spirit world.

But if this house was mine,
I promise...

My family would always
have a home here at Echoville.

Really?

All this time, I thought
I was alone in these worlds.

But now, I've found my family.

I never want you
to leave me again.

I would insist you stay,
whether I'm dead or alive.

That's very generous.

Thank you, Ghoster.

Actually, what's your real name?

William.

It's a pleasure
to meet you, William.

We did it.

Dad.
Huh?

Right.

It's Friday the 13th.

We've got one shot at this.

Are we ready?

Ready as we'll ever be.

You, Juan, and I should
probably stay behind,

guard the house.

Keep anyone from the bank away.

Yeah.

Okay.

Let's go get Ghoster.

They'll be fine.

This is the moment
everything has been building to.

We need to focus on the goal.

It's gonna be scary.

You can't let that stop you.

Yuto must be defeated tonight.

You can do this,
William. You can.

Ready?
Ready.

Okay, so...

what do we do, Ghoster?

The light of the full moon
needs to hit the painting.

Look, it's happening.

Wow.

They don't make paintings
like that anymore.

Elizabeth, hold out the key.

Here we go.

Here it is... The doorway
to the first challenge.

Let's go.

What's with the owl?

I wonder if the statues
have something to do with it.

I know the letters
on the shields

must be part of the solution.

This one says K.

What?
K!

This one has an A.

This one has an E.

Ooh!

This one says B.
Wait, Mateo.

Was it something I said?

I think we need
to say them in order.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It's a scrambled word.

The letters are...

B, K, E, and A.

I've got it. Bake.

It's worth a try.

B, A, K, E!

I don't think it was bake.
Wait!

Guys, the owl statue.

Notice what's missing?

Beak, of course!
It has to be beak.

It better be, or we're
gonna be shish kebabs.

Wait a minute, kebab!
K, A...

It's beak.
Yeah. Too many As.

B, E, A, K!

Well, that was easy.

"Kabab"? Really?

Uh? Hmm.

What do you think this means?

It seems like the levers
control the mirrors.

Let's find out.
Be careful.

It's cool.

I get it.

We need to position the mirrors

so that the light bounces
around the room.

What are we aiming for?

Uh, my guess would be this.

Right.

The owl led the way
last time. Why not this time?

Well, what are we waiting for?

Thanks.

There has to be a clue to
what order we pull the levers.

Look, here's something.

The numbers one, two, and six.

It's not much to go on.

I found something.

It looks like these are numbers.

Roman numerals.

I got this. Okay.

We know one works.
One.

Two.

Six.

I thought you said you got this!

I don't understand!
It's one, two, six!

We're hosed.

Don't give up.
We can figure this out.

That's easy for you to say.

You can fly!

Plus, you're already dead.

That was uncalled for.

Mom, I could really
use your help here.

One.
What are you doing?

Two.
Are you trying to kill us?

Do you trust me?
Together.

Four!

How did...

When I looked in the mirror,
it came to me.

The reflection of six is four.

You're a genius.

I never would have
figured that out.

Aren't you glad you trusted me?

I didn't, really.

I just thought
that if I was gonna die,

I wanted to be
holding your hand.

If you're scared and want to hold
my hand, all you have to do is ask.

I'm not scared.

<i>I</i> wasn't the one
screaming earlier.

Bring it on!

Let's do this!

There you are. Thank
heavens I found you.

Connie?

Quick, we need to get back to
the house and help your father.

What's going on?

The bank sent a dozen men.

James needs our help.
You'll have to finish this later.

I... We can't just leave.

It's an emergency.

He wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

Let's go.

How'd you get down here?

The door in the painting,
it's still open, okay?

Come on. There is
no time to lose.

You solved all the puzzles?

Well, not exactly.

Let's just say,
Ghoster is not the only one

who can travel through mirrors.

Look, it's Yuto!

We've come too far
for you to stop us now, Yuto.

The light knife.

You think,
with your little knife,

that you have the power
to take on me?

<i>Ingara Rozora.</i>

No!

What's happening?

Elizabeth... help... me.

<i>Did you really think I'd let you</i>

<i>get through all of my
challenges and defeat me?</i>

Where is my father?

<i>Busy with something or other.</i>

<i>He's the least
of your worries now.</i>

What have you done to him?!

<i>Oh, he's just a little tied up...</i>

Excuse me.

I said, he's tied up.

What have you done with Ghoster?

I placed a spell on him.

His life force is draining.

By midnight, he will be no more.

What do we do now?

On the count of three,
you go left, I'll go right.

Okay, so on three,
or after three?

I count to three and then we go.

You know I can hear you, right?

Three!

Mateo!

I've dreamt of this
moment for 50 years.

Finally, the bloodline
is complete.

You see,

with your mother
and uncle's souls...

I thought I'd finally found
a pair of siblings

to complete the transformation.

But when that wretched
uncle of theirs

sent your mother away...

I had to bide my time

and wait for the next
full moon...

and your arrival.

What do you mean?

A female member of your
family's bloodline was required.

Who do you think sent
the inheritance letter?

So now with you here,
my young heiress...

just as I planned,
my rebirth is assured.

Not today, Yuto.

What's this?

No!

No, this isn't how it ends.

Not like this!

No!

Grab the box, Elizabeth.

Where's Yuto?

Sit on this.

That's something I can do.

I am so proud of you.

You've been incredibly brave
through all this time.

Mom... I'm still
so scared for Ghoster.

I can save him.

But I need to say goodbye
before I do.

I cannot return after.

No, Mom, I can't lose you again.

But I can give him
a life he never had.

I love you, Mom.

Darling, I love you.

I will always be with you.

Always.

So what? Should we
head back now?

Okay.

Abigail!

Is it... really you?

Promise me
you'll watch over her.

I will. I promise.

There's no time.
I must go.

I've waited 50 years for this.

Hi, guys.

Abigail, what are you doing?

Wait, is that...

Oh!

What's happening?

Two past 12:00.

He should be here by now.

Look.

William.

Welcome to the land
of the living.

It's good to be back.

The lot of you. You're
out of here. You're gone.

Mr. Alessi,

<i>I</i> am the rightful heir
and owner of Echoville Manor,

<i>and</i> you are trespassing.
Kindly leave.

You? Oh, that's cute.

But you're just a kid.

Listen, the bank
now owns this property.

The time to claim it
has long since passed.

I believe this
should more than cover

James's outstanding debts
with interest.

So let's consider
this matter closed.

Let's go, boys.

Now that unpleasantness
is sorted,

I believe we have
a party to attend.

She's always here.

I know.

I just realized,
you've never danced before.

I believe you are
absolutely right.

May I have the honor?
