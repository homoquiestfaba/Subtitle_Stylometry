Mom!

CHRISTINA:
Sandy? It's Chris.

the girls out of here.

He almost killed me tonight.

SANDY, OVER PHONE:
<i>Calm down.</i>

<i>Go pack yourself up.</i>

<i>Come over here.</i>

Really?

<i>Really.</i>

<i>Yeah, for sure.</i>
<i>You got to get out of there.</i>


(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

Going to the ring
tonight?

Yeah.

Cool.

Everyone's going.

Meet me outside.
I want to show you something.

Okay.

TEACHER: Class, your homework
assignment for tomorrow

is chapter 5,
questions 1, 2, 3.

And then after you're done
with that

you can start on
your next assignment,

which will be chapter 10,
one through seven...


Is there something funny
that you'd like to share

with the class?
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Hurry up.

You got me
in trouble,

you dodo bird.

You're the dodo bird.

Come on.

Hey!

What's going on?

We're going to Florida.

Here.

So that your eyes don't burn out
from all the sunshine.

Come on,
get in, get in.

Cool!

(CAR DOORS CLOSING)

Come on, get in.

I'm going to need
a co-pilot.

I'll be damned
if I'm going to take

any lame asses
across state line.

We either do this together
or not at all.

SHELL:
I'm not a lame ass.

Why are we going
to Florida?

I called Sandy.

She said she could
get me a job.

It's as simple
as that.

Does Grandma know?

I'll tell her
when we get there.

I need to get down there
and make some money first.

I'm not going to sit here
and listen to her

tell me what a fucking
loser I am

for having to move us
back into her house.

Is that okay with you?

You're either in
or you're out.

Travelin' 77 south.

CHRISTINA:
Lock your doors.

We wouldn't want some trucker
crawling in here

looking for a warm bed
full of ladies.

Yeah, sure you wouldn't.

Good night, John-Boy.

It's not going to be
forever.

What if it sucks?

Then we'll go back
to Grandma's.

Is it just going to be
the three of us?

Just the three of us.

You promise?

Yeah, I promise.

Good night, John-Boy.

Good night,

CHRISTINA:
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

Wait, wait.
Let me park the car first.

Sandy!

Hey, girls.

Whoa, Nellie,
don't spill my beer.


Come on.
Welcome to Florida, baby.

Sandy!

Aah!

But the cleaning part
is just for now.

The boss man has other stuff
coming up,

but you're going to have to meet
him before that happens.

Do you think he's going
to like me?

He's going to love you.

Why?

Well, you're good-looking,
for one.

What does that have to do
with cleaning houses?

It doesn't.

But it matters.

(OBJECTS CRASHING)

(MAN AND WOMAN ARGUING LOUDLY)

MAN:
What's wrong with you?!

Come back here, Shauna!

SHELL:
I don't know why you didn't

just ask her
if you could have it.

I don't want her to think
I'm so charity case, that's why.

Where did you get that?

What?

The gum in your mouth.

Um...

back there.

Back where?

In the store.

We didn't buy any gum,
Shell.

Well, I couldn't
hold it,

so I put it
in my pocket

and I forgot
it was there.

Spit it out.

Spit it out.

Okay, we're going
to go back,

and you're going to tell
the store lady you stole it.

She'll probably make you
give something back.

Why?!
Because we're not trash, Shell.

We don't steal.

I didn't mean to.

Okay, but you did.
Come on.

This sucks.

Sorry, bud.

SHELL:
Let's all eat.

(CAR HORN HONKING)

Let's make some pasta.

All right,
wish me luck.

For what? Cleaning?

Good luck!
Thank you, Shell.

She'll like
living here.

I'm going to get
the food.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING

(ENGINE REVVING)

<i>â™ª It's too late to turn back</i>

Is that a fucking

WOMAN:
Uh-huh.

They call it the Venice
of America.


Can I get one of those?

<i>â™ª This is strange</i>

<i>â™ª Tonight</i>

WOMAN:
Are you afraid of birds?

CHRISTINA:
No.

Good. They're good
security.

What?

(BIRD SQUAWKING)

Wow.

Are you fucking
kidding me?

PARROT:
Hello.

Hello.
Hello.

All right,
nobody's here.

All you got to do
is dust the place.

You'll find everything
you need in the kitchen.

All right.
Pick you up at noon.

Cool? All right.
Sure.


Hey, guys.

PARROT:
Hello.

Hello.

(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

<i>â™ª</i>

(BIRDS SQUAWKING AND CHIRPING)

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Hi.

Sign here.

Oh, I'm just the cleaning lady.
Yeah, yeah.

Sign it anyway.

PARROT:
Hello.

Later.

Later.

Hey. What's up, mi amiga?
Hmm?

What are you doing
down here, Sandy?


Working.

Yeah, but doing what?

You know, same shit
I was doing in Ohio,

just bigger.

Jeez, Chris,
it's just pot.

How much bigger?

Can't say.

Sorry, chica.

Mum's the word.

Says who?

The boss man.

That's just the way
he does it.

All right, look.

Cleaning's the first rung.

After that,
if he likes your work

then you can do
the fun stuff.

And if not, well,
then let's just say

you got to find yourself
a new line of work.

Oh, yeah? Like what?

I don't know.
Got a nice ass.

Maybe a little
go-go dancing.

If you think I'm going back
to that shit.


All right, all right.

Let me try
and work some magic.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

SANDY: Thanks for coming so quick.
Come here.

All right,
now the fun starts.

So this dude Ray,
this hot dude,

he's going to ask you for change
in a white pickup truck.

And I just hand it to him?
That's it.

All right.

Are you sure you're all right
doing this?

Because this is
the last stop, Chris.

Okay.

He's going to be expecting
my car. Take it.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO)

Wow, Sandy.

Either you got
better-looking

or I'm about to meet
the new girl

boss man's been
talking about.

You better not let Sandy
hear you say that.

It'll be our little
secret.

How do you know
I can keep one?

Just a feeling.

You got some change
for me?

Look, if you ever need
a tour guide or anything,

my hourly rate
is pretty reasonable.


Ray. So I guess the position
of the tour guide is taken.

Nah. I just like
to get first names.

Part of my redneck
upbringing.

In that case...

I'll show you around
the Everglades.

You, uh...

You might recognize
some family members there.


Well, now I'm definitely
not calling.

(MUSIC PLAYING OVER TRANSISTOR RADIO)

Oh, what a day, huh?

So you, uh,
you live here?

Yeah.

By yourself?

I wish.


Ah, the parents, huh?
I get it.

Yeah, my mom.

So, what's, uh...

what's your mom do?

She cleans.

(WOLF WHISTLING)

PARROT:
Hello.

Relax, sister.

It's the moment of truth.

Yeah?
Mm-hm.

Boss man's having
his birthday party tonight,

and he would be delighted
to meet you.

Cool.

Look good.

What? This isn't working
for you?


But I smell so good.

CHRISTINA:
You know,

you might want to try staying
inside the lines.

Okay.

<i>â™ª</i>

What's the word, perm?

Hey.

Really?

Come on.
Look at you.

Seriously?

I look good.

(ENGINE STARTING)

Look, don't spend it all
in one place,

and make sure Shell
gets something to eat

that isn't sugar,
all right?

You look nice, by the way.

Thank you.

Get your shoes on.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Miss Ohio.

Mm-mm. I'm glad
you could finally

grace us
with your presence.

And this is, well,

we like to call him
the Captain.

Hi. Christina.

Pleasure.

I heard some kind
of rumour about being able

to eat off the kitchen floor
at the bird house.

Wasn't like that
when Sandy was at it.

Come on.

You know where
my skills lie, hmm?

So, uh, where did
you two meet?

We danced together at this place
called Ember's Tomb.

Oh, boy. Lunch shift.
What a shithole.


You work in the houses?
Yeah.

Not for long.

CAPTAIN:
Yeah, of course.

SANDY:
Come on, follow me.

I want to show you
something.

Nice to meet you.

Would you like
to dance?

Sure.

I've heard some real good things
about you, Christina.

You must be
the boss man.

Evening.

Hey, got a cigarette?

Sure.

Your dad know
you out here?

No. He doesn't care.

Chris.

Zada.

I'm upstairs if you ever
need anything.

Thanks.

Hey. I hope your ass
is free tonight.

Why? What's up?

We're celebrating.

Fucking what, already?

Your first trip out.

Really?

When?

Boss man wants you
on the water ASAP.

Apparently you got
potential.

Cool.

All right,
first things first.

The rules.

Follow me.

One: no sampling the load.

Two: never,
ever throw a load.

And three: no relationships
inside the organization.

The boss man does not like
the right hand knowing

what the left hand's doing.

Comprende?
What?

I'm not fucking around here,
Chris.

You got to pay attention.

I'm here for you, Sandy.
Whatever you need.

All right.

First thing we got to do
is find a boat.

How about that one?

Too big. We're looking for
a 30- to 40-foot fishing boat.

Anything bigger
draws too much attention.

Anything smaller doesn't have
enough storage.

All right, Chris.
Let's see what you got.

This guy's cool.

Anyone aboard?

Can I help you?
Hi.

Uh, I was wondering
if you rent your boat.

Sure do, but I won't be around
to run it.

I've got some relatives
in town.

You got to start thinking
like a sailor.

So you only want
to buy food that keeps,

because you never know how long
you're going to be out there.

You want canned, dry, pickled,
smoked, but only the good stuff.

Look, Chris, we're moving drugs,
not rockets.

Just be good at your job,
and look good doing it.

My, oh, my.

Must be destiny.

You know Ray,
the Captain.

And this is Duane.

He's the best fisherman
in Florida.

You make good coffee?

I've been told.
RAY: Well, you better,

because we got a hot date in
the morning with this charmer,

and you don't want
to see him behind the wheel

when Sandy's making coffee.

This is my new friend.

Rain. You want some?

Are we in trouble?

Sure looks that way.

How long are you going
to be gone?

A couple of days.

Hey.

I didn't think you guys
were going to make it.


Hey, beautiful.

What kind of bait
you using?

I'm not.

Well, you got to offer
the fish something, darling.

I thought it was just
supposed to look like

we're out here
fishing.

I mean, it is, you know?

But we might as well see
what Poseidon has to offer

while we're doing it,
right?

Let's see what
we got here.

All right. Okay.

Actually,
you know what?

It's bad luck to have someone
bait your hook. Come here.

Come here.

You know, I never took you
for the squeamish type.

I'm not. It's just I've never
used something so big.

You give me a minnow
and I'm all over it.

Well, it's the same
principle.

You're going to want to get it
on there nice and secure,

and leave just enough dangle
to get their attention.

Flip that switch.

Come on,
we got the mothership.

RAY:
Think you got this, Miss Ohio?

Don't you worry
about cops?

No. International waters.

CHRISTINA:
Where does it go from here?

RAY:
Inland.

You know,
the boss's houses,

where we hold it until
it's picked up and goes north.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Get your shit packed,
girls.

Hey.
Hmm.

Get up.

Well? Come on.

It's all yours.

Oh, wow.

CHRISTINA:
All right.

I think I can
handle this.

(PLAYING NOTES)


No, no, no, no.

Let me show you
how it's done.

Okay.
All right.



All right.

Told you.


No way.

Come here.

(MAKING KISSING SOUNDS)

Hi.


Hi. Hi.

Hi, bud.
What's your name?

SHELL:
Sandy told Mommy

it's a gift
from the boss man.

What if he doesn't
like us?

Then we'll...

We'll run away
on the horse

and call Grandma
to come get us.

Can we do that?

Yeah.

Grandma said
I'm an adult now,

and I can leave
whenever I want.

I mean take the horse.

She said it was
a gift, right?

Yeah.

Then it's ours.

(ENGINE SPUTTERING DISTANTLY)

(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

(ENGINE SHUTS OFF)

Mom?

Turn the light off.

Come here.

CHRISTINA:
Do you want to keep the horse?

Then you got to be cool,
MJ.

Boss man's storing
some stuff in there,

and we need to be cool
about it.

No one but me, you or Shell
goes inside the barn.

You understand?

Yeah.

Good.

Because I'd like us
to stay put for a while.

<i>â™ª</i>

SHELL:
You look stupid.

Mom says it makes me
look smart.

Pancakes!

And...

fresh-squeezed
Florida orange juice

for my two lucky ladies.

Why are we lucky?

Because I took the day off
so I could make you breakfast

and drive you
to your first day of school.

But the bus comes
right to the driveway.

I know, but I thought
it would be a nice treat.

But it comes
right to the driveway.

And I want to watch my two girls
walk into that school

with all those
other rich kids.

No, but I want
to ride the bus.

Why are you giving me
such a hard time about this, MJ?

Because I don't want to be
dropped off like a little kid.

I want to ride the bus.

CHRISTINA:
Remember, baby,

you're the smartest
girl here.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

So?

It's so cool.

They have a treasure box
in class

that only the good girls
get to see.

And I already have
a best friend, named Megan.

Great. So?

It's okay.

She has a boyfriend.

What? I do not.

Really? Who?

The boy
down the street.

Wait, no, no.
And he's not.

His locker is next to mine.
Jeez, spaz.

Hey!
Hey, hey.

Enough, enough.
All right,

I got to show you guys
something.

Whoa.

Holy shit.
Hey, watch your mouth.

Okay, here's how it goes.

That's for Bugsy.
That's not.

<i>â™ª</i>

RAY:
Mm, that smells like homecoming.

(CAPTAIN CHUCKLING)

Oh, yeah. And I'm thinking
of having some homecoming dinner

over at Duke's joint
tonight.

You want to join me?

Well, as long as he's still
got his mom

chained to the stove,
absolutely.

(CAPTAIN LAUGHING)

Shit.

What?
They're stranded.

CHRISTINA: How can you tell?
CAPTAIN: The flare.

Shit. Is everything covered?

Uh, mostly. But we didn't get
everything underneath.

CHRISTINA: Can't we just turn around
and pretend like we didn't see them?

No. It's illegal to leave the
scene of a vessel in distress.

And they saw us.

Coast Guard.

Fuck me.

Hello!

Hey, there.

What's the trouble?

COAST GUARD OFFICER:
We've been taking on water.

Can you transfer us
to port?

Of course.

Come onboard.

COAST GUARD OFFICER:
This is one beautiful skiff.


A container, huh?

All those cargo ships
must have created

a debris field
on the way out.

I will be making a thorough
and detailed report

once we get back
to dry land.

Work or pleasure?

Both. I'm working...


...they are pleasuring.

It's a honeymoon job.

COAST GUARD OFFICER:
Oh, I see.

I've been on
a few of those myself.

Gentlemen, would you care
to join me on the bridge?

I got a nip
of 12-year-old scotch

I can't wait to break into.

COAST GUARD OFFICER:
No, sir. We are still on duty.

Although a cup of joe
always seems to calm my nerves.

Of course.

Ray, would you mind making
the officer a cup of coffee?

Oh, no, no. I don't want
to bother your hires.

I know my way
around a galley.

Oh, no, no.

Come on, Captain.
Tell him.

He wants my cup
of coffee.

I mean, anything
for the coastguard.

CAPTAIN: Christina, would you
mind bringing it up to the bridge

when it's ready?

Of course.

Hey.

COAST GUARD OFFICER:
You. You have mahogany?

That was fucking crazy, man.

I mean, those sea scouts
were on our fucking boat.

That's your cut.

It won't bite you.

Sure it won't.

(SHELL SHRIEKING)

They're biting me!
Come here!


Where were you?
(GASPING AND PANTING)

Up, up.
Arms up. Arms up.

I leave you for one day.

You kidding me?

It's okay.

Shh. It's okay.

It's okay. Hey, hey.

Shh. Look at me.
It's okay.

Good.

Terry, this is my girl,

Nice to meet you,

Nice to meet you,
Boy Terry.

Well, as a great fisherman
once said,

better is the end of a thing
when it's beginning.

I have no idea
what the fuck you just said.

No one does
till they're at the end.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

Mom?

(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

Neither did the Captain.

What do you mean
didn't show?

Yeah, everything's cool.

Just go back to bed.

Anyway...

(ALL LAUGHING DRUNKENLY)

Oh, God! You're fucking crazy!

RAIN:
Not very exciting,

but if I had to pick one,

if it was the last day
on planet Earth,

I'd pick ABBA
over the Bee Gee's.

MJ:
Everybody but you.

RAIN:
Are you kidding me?

They're the hottest shit
right now.

Really far out.

Like, right now
there's no current...

Nobody sounds like that.

MJ:
Okay, yeah but...

No, but the others
are legends.

Innovational.

Who's a legend?

You're out of your...

You've lost your mind.

SHELL:
He's a jerk. I hate him.

You don't even know him.

He never says hi.

And all he does
is just look at your boobs.

Would you like to go
on the slide, Mr. Doodles?

Oh, yes. I would love
to go on the slide.

Yeah, I love...

Are you fucking
kidding me, MJ?

MJ!

You get back here!

MJ!

You want to fuck up everything
we got going here?!

MJ:
Why does it matter?

Because I told you no one
goes in there.

So fucking what?
So fucking what?!

So fucking what?! Who the fuck
do you think you are?

Do you understand
what you could have done?

(SHELL SCREAMING)

Stop hurting her!


Get off me.

Get out of my room!

Jesus, I hate you!
Get out! Shell, get out!


Now!

I'm leaving.
You think you can stick around,

or are you planning
on prowling the neighbourhood?

We should have never
left Ohio.

Because I don't want you
ruining your life

with the shithead
next door?

Because Grandma took care
of Shell and I didn't have to.

Don't worry about taking care
of your sister.

I'll find someone who's thankful
to have a roof over their head

and doesn't mind a little
responsibility in return.

I'm disappointed, MJ.

Stop acting like it was so
fucking great at your grandma's.

(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

SHELL: Why do some look
bigger than others?

MJ:
I don't know.

Why are some brighter?

Maybe they were born
that way.

Why?

God wanted it that way,
I guess.

I don't think so.

I think they were all
born bright,

and then after a while,

all the stuff around them,
dust and stuff,

covered them up.

So you just
can't see them.

But they're still bright
underneath.

It's still there
if you look close enough.

That's why you're going
to be the doctor

and I'm going
to ride horses.

Can we go to the beach
when you get back?

MJ really wants to.
No, I don't.

Yes, she does.

Sure.

All right, I'll call you when I get back.
Okay.

Bye, girls.

MJ:
I'm already going to the beach.

How?

Don't worry about it.

But you got nice colours.

I'm so white.

No, but it's beautiful.
It's nice.

crawling on my fucking boat!

I don't owe
the boss man nothing.

So grab a bale and get the fuck
over the rail here.

I'm not touching it.

(WATER SPLASHING)

(WATER SPLASHING)

We have a problem.

(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

Did you know that the study
of human behaviour

first began with
the study of animals?

Darwin discovered
that animals

exhibit patterns of behaviour
based on survival

and natural selection.

And once you control
the variables,

those behaviours also
can be limited, manipulated.

In theory,

if an animal
is taken care of,

nurtured, fed...

it will exhibit behaviour
that can be predicted.

But every so often

a random gene
enters the mix

and changes the direction
of the group.

And it has
to be extracted.

Before the entire herd
can duplicate the pattern.

Boss, I did not throw that load.
I swear to God.

You tell me exactly
what happened.

The rules exist
for a reason, Christina.

But I'm sure you already
understand that.

Dollar a pound.

Your cut, plus BK
and Duane's.

They won't
be needing theirs.

It pays to be more intelligent
than an animal.

CHRISTINA:
Terry?

TERRY:
I'll be right out.

NEWSWOMAN, OVER TV: <i>...The impact

<i>What do you have, Nicole?</i>

NICOLE:
<i>The bodies of two men,</i>

<i>Duane Hoffman</i>
<i>and Brian Klay III</i>

<i>were just discovered</i>
<i>lifeless</i>

<i>in front of</i>
<i>the Ocean View Hotel.</i>

<i>The circumstances</i>
<i>surrounding this incident</i>

<i>are still under</i>
<i>investigation.</i>

What can I do you for,
beautiful?

Whisky and water.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)


Girls?

MJ, put the magazine down.

I love you very much.

You know that,
don't you?

If anything were

to ever happen...

What's going to happen
to you?

Nothing's going
to happen to me.

Nothing's going to happen.
I just...

I just want to make sure
that you know what to do...

if anything ever did.

I know you're
big girls now,

but if something does...

I want you to call your grandma
so she can come get you, okay?

What's going
to happen, Mom?

Nothing's going to happen.


Okay.

You're going to need
a larger boat than usual.

Big enough to fit
six tonnes.

Wow.

New group.

Get someone else
to handle it.

No, I can handle it.

Good.

You wanted to make
an impression.

I figured I could trust you
to do that.

I'll take care of it.

Guess who's going out tonight?

CHRISTINA: I have no idea.
RAIN: We are.

CHRISTINA:
No, we're not.

RAIN:
Wait, wait. No, no. Please.

Please, please, please,
please, please.

It took me some real bo-jo
to get these tickets.

Get what?
Tickets to Blue Comet Cowboys.

CHRISTINA:
Hey, man, I got to work.

I mean, maybe if you had
given me a little notice.

Can't you skip?
No.

Wait, I'll go.

Absolutely not.
Wait, why not?

Because.
Because why?

I finished off
my homework.

It's a school night.

We wouldn't be late,
would we, Rain?

Nope, not too late.

MJ: See? Mom, we won't be late.
Please.

CHRISTINA:
I don't have time for this.

It's my first concert.
What do you want me to say?

Yes.

Please.

Fine.

Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

Thank you so much.
Rain, I'm coming!

Looking good.

Right.

Now, since I know
these dudes,

we're going to be going
backstage and shit.

All right?
So you got to be cool.

Totally.

All right.

You ready?
Yeah.

Okay.

That's not a bad song.
Mm-mm.

You know, I thought we would
try something

a little more civilized
tonight.

Well, isn't that nice.

Yeah. Beautiful.

And I bet
it tastes good too.

Smells good.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO)

Can I have some?

Okay.



(RAIN LAUGHING)

Hola, chica.

CHRISTINA:
Hi.

CÃƒÂ³mo estÃƒÂ¡s?
How are you?

Good, good.
You got something for me?

Yes. The yacht behind us.

It's coming.

Ah, gracias.

Nothing like a cold beer
on a hot day.

I know, right? Salud.

Cheers.

Mm.

So, does boss man...
Where does he have you stay?

In Lauderdale.

Ah. You live by the beach.

No. Our holding house
is at the canal.

Ah. The big ones.

Mm-hm.

He really knows how
to take care of his girls.

Yes, he does.

SHELL, NARRATING:
<i>Gas, grass or ass.</i>

<i>Nobody rides for free.</i>

<i>On August 7th, 1978,</i>

<i>agents acting on reliable</i>
<i>information</i>

<i>from an undercover</i>
<i>informant</i>

<i>that passed contraband</i>
<i>directly to the defendant</i>

<i>conducted a successful raid</i>

<i>at 142 Tropicana Circle.</i>

<i>Agents were conducting</i>
<i>a search of the premises</i>

<i>when a vehicle containing</i>
<i>Christina Milland</i>

<i>stopped in front</i>
<i>of the house.</i>

<i>Miss Milland was a passenger</i>
<i>in the vehicle,</i>

<i>and had been targeted</i>
<i>in an ongoing observation</i>

<i>of the Pink Coral Inn,</i>

<i>a known location</i>
<i>for drug transactions.</i>

<i>Christina Milland</i>
<i>refused to cooperate</i>

<i>by not giving her real</i>
<i>name or address.</i>

<i>Photos of the defendant</i>
<i>were found in the house</i>

<i>in the same room</i>
<i>as women's clothing.</i>

(CELL DOOR BUZZING OPEN)

(DOOR BUZZING OPEN)

SHELL: "Miss Milland was arrested
in front of the house at 3:30 a.m.,

"just one hour
after the initial raid.

"They seized over 15,000 pounds
of marijuana

"with a street value
of over $3 million.

It is the largest drug seizure
in the county's history."

TEACHER: Well, thank you
for sharing, Shell,

and, uh, being at

Is the person in the article
someone you know?

She's my mom.

I don't know.

I don't think

You're the dodo bird.

Yeah?

MJ's driving?

Sure is. But you watch

You got precious cargo

Yes, ma'am.

Don't make me

I know.

CHRISTINA:
Being a mom

the only...

the only thing that a mother
thinks about

is taking care of her children,
no matter what.

And I think a lot
of the drug stuff

where all the women
are in jail,

I think that's a big part

of just trying to take care
of your family, you know?

If you can't get any
government help

or you can't
find a job,

then you resort
to other things.

That's the way it is.

You do what you got to do,
you know,

to take care of your kids
and your family.

And that's what I did.

<i>â™ª To let me roam</i>

<i>â™ª Into the other side</i>

<i>â™ª You'll never know</i>

<i>â™ª Just how far I'll go</i>

<i>â™ª To sail the sea</i>
