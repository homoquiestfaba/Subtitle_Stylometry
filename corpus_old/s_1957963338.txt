We are not leaving!

Mni Wiconi!
<i>- Water is life!</i>

<i>I want to make sure that</i>

both sides are refraining
from situations

<i>that might result in</i>
<i>people being hurt.</i>

<i>As we reported</i>
<i>last week,</i>

<i>a protest in North Dakota</i>

<i>against a major oil pipeline</i>

<i>continues to grow.</i>

<i>Over 100 Native American</i>
<i>tribes have joined the fight</i>

<i>against the project,</i>

<i>saying that it threatens</i>
<i>one tribe's water supply</i>

<i>and its sacred lands.</i>

Oh, my God, we
should send a selfie to Mike.

Oh wait,
let's take one more.

One more, okay.

15 dollars
and 30 cents, please.

]

Hurry up!

Come on.

Are you sure you
should be doing this?

Why? Am I the only
female in human history

to want to nest
while she's pregnant?

Why isn't Dan doing this?

I don't know,
why don't you ask him?

We know how that would go.

I'm exhausted.

How's it going with him?

Eh.

He's got his good days
and bad days.

<i>I think he's in complete denial</i>
<i>that this baby is coming.</i>

Hey.

Okay, so his income
last year was 19,000 dollars,

his wife's pregnant,

<i>his car was recently</i>
<i>repossessed by the bank,</i>

<i>and his credit score,</i>

<i>438.</i>

And he's a Republican.

<i>Yeah, he's perfect.</i>

<i>Every dad's in</i>
<i>denial before the baby comes.</i>

<i>Yeah, but he</i>
<i>won't even touch me.</i>

You know, sometimes
I feel her kicking at night,

and I ask him to put
his hand on my belly

and he's too scared to touch it.

<i>Oh, Jules,</i>

<i>you got this.</i>

And that's my cue.

I'm gonna see
you tomorrow, right?

Yeah, unless
you're giving birth.

Thanks.

You're not scraping
anything tomorrow.

You better help out more.

I'll bring beer.

-Hi.
-Hey, Sam.

Need a hand?

Uh...

No, I think I got it, thanks.

Dan.

She needs you,

and that baby's
gonna need you, too.

I got it, thanks.

Hey.

Hi.

Did Sam help or...

just talk?

Well, I'll tell you what,
you got this.

I gotta go get some pages done.

Okay, well we need to
do the nursery today.

I know.

But I'm behind and I have
to get some pages out.

Fine.

Thank you.

<i>The Department of Justice</i>

<i>has halted construction</i>

<i>on the multi-billion dollar</i>
<i>Dakota Access Pipeline.</i>

<i>The same oil pipeline that</i>
<i>brought thousands of protesters</i>

<i>to the Standing Rock</i>
<i>Reservation in North Dakota.</i>

<i>This victory for protesters</i>
<i>was short lived however,</i>

<i>as construction on</i>
<i>the pipeline continues</i>

<i>in areas outside of</i>
<i>federal jurisdiction.</i>

<i>Just as construction</i>
<i>crews continue to work,</i>

<i>the protesters continue</i>
<i>to attempt to block them.</i>

<i>We are</i>
<i>four days from the convention</i>

<i>in Cleveland. Ohio Senator</i>
<i>Rob Portman with me now,</i>

<i>he's up for reelection</i>
<i>today from Washington.</i>

How you doing, brother?

Hey, Dan, you good?
Hey, Patch.

Knee bothering you again?

Yeah, it gets a little worse
when it gets cold.

You gotta see this.

<i>...about</i>
<i>40% of Republicans</i>

<i>in all three states,</i>

<i>Iowa, New Hampshire,</i>
<i>and South Carolina,</i>

<i>Donald Trump has</i>
<i>a commanding lead.</i>

Hell yeah!

Well, you're upbeat,
that's new.

Yeah, he's on new medication.

-Uppers.
-Shut up.

Is that you?

Hello?
How often do we get

Dan McKinney, please.

I'm sorry, can you
repeat that please?

<i>I'm looking for Dan McKinney.</i>

You know what,
I'm gonna to go outside.

Alright, thanks.
Oh, don't go outside.

-Dan, come on.
-If that's Hillary, man,

hang up.

Sorry, who's this again?

Oh, hi.
My name is Ricky Scott,

I'm with the <i>Houston Daily</i> .

How you doing?

The <i>Houston Daily</i> ?

Dan, we really like that
<i>Associated Press</i> piece you did

for the Cleveland Refinery,

and I need something
similar on an oil pipeline

that's getting some
resistance in North Dakota.

And I think that you have
the right perspective.

Okay.

The media is all over

this Native American
protest up there

and we need a no BS
profile on that pipeline.

<i>We need jobs, numbers,</i>
<i>the importance to the economy.</i>

<i>So are you in?</i>

Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm in.

<i>Excellent.</i>
<i>I'm gonna pair you</i>

<i>with a gentleman</i>
<i>from the pipeline company,</i>

<i>his name's Elliot.</i>

And I hope it's not too
much of an inconvenience

to get you on a plane
tomorrow morning at six AM.

What's the pay again?

Did they say
how they found you?

My Cleveland Refinery piece.

Hmm.

Hey, have you seen
my field recorder?

No, not for a while.

-I'm gonna grab a snack.
-Okay.

Hey, get the list.

Okay.

Hey.
Here you go.

What do you got?

Sam and I are gonna
go to the thrift store

and see what we can
find on this list.

But,

even that...

Okay well,

they said they'd wire the
first payment tomorrow, so.

Promise me you'll...

What, Julie?

Come back.

Be safe.

I will.

You stay warm, okay?

â™ª Black cat on your doorstep â™ª

â™ª A hoot owl callin' your name â™ª

â™ª The hound dogs well
they won't keep quiet â™ª

â™ª And it's bad luck the same â™ª

Welcome.

Dan McKinney?
Yeah.

Elliot Jameson.

Hello.
Hi.

Sorry, it's a little tight.

Yeah, it's just
a little smaller

than I'm accustomed to.

You sure it's gonna fly?

Yeah.

You know, the commercial
airport in Bismark's a mess,

thanks to the protesters.

But I'm coming in
from Pennsylvania.

It's an easy stop over

and we could get some
work done on the way.

Okay, good.

You know we had a little
weather coming in, so...

it might get bumpy.

You religious?

When necessary.

That's good.

Hope we don't need it.

Rough flight?

There was a little turbulence.

Here you go.

Dan, I'd like you to
meet a couple people.

This is Sheriff Glasser.

Sheriff.

And Marty Sherman. He heads up
the private security for us.

How you doing, Marty?

Are those...

These are all
non-lethal firearms,

they fire rubber bullets.

You wanna try one?

The bullet or the gun?

Well, if you need
anything while you're here,

these are the guys to talk to.

-Okay.
-Alright, we should get going.

Alright, nice meeting you.

Hope you don't get car sick.

I'll pick you up
first thing in the morning.

Alright, thanks.

Listen, Elliot,

what exactly is it that you do?

I connect people.

I help people.

The pipeline company
is my client,

but right now my
job is to help you

tell the best story you can.

And what story is that?

Whatever you write,
whatever you see.

Okay.

You know, we're a lot more
alike than you might think, Dan.

How's that?

Marine Corps.

Spent some time in Afghanistan,

some other operations.

After I got out, I still
wanted to serve my country.

Helping get the
oil pipelines built?

Absolutely.

America doesn't
run on fairy dust.

That's true.

Can't tell some people that.

Not California.

Don't get me started.

<i>...large oil pipeline,</i>

<i>which will run through</i>
<i>several states when completed,</i>

<i>will taint important</i>
<i>drinking water supplies</i>

<i>and unearth</i>
<i>sacred burial sites.</i>

<i>By September,</i>

<i>a federal judge should rule on</i>
<i>whether construction will be</i>

<i>permanently halted</i>
<i>on the pipeline.</i>

What's this?

Welcome to the circus.

Grab your camera, do your thing.

I'll circle around and
meet you on the other side.

Okay.

For the children!

Come on. It'll be fun.

Yeah. No, no, no.

-All over it.
-Alright.

For our brothers!

We stand!
We stand!

We stand!
We stand!

For our sisters!
For our sisters!

We stand!
We stand!

For our brothers!
For our brothers!

We stand!
We stand!

For the earth!
For the earth!

We stand!
We stand!

For the water!

For the water!

We stand!
For our sisters!

We stand!

We stand!
For our brothers!

For our brothers!
We stand!

We stand!
For water!

For water!
We stand!

For water!
For water!

We stand!
Put that camera down.

What do you think
you're doing here, man?

You think this is
entertainment?

We're protecting your water,

after your people
stole our land.

So put the camera down
and come join the real fight.

Stand up and fight!

Dan. Dan. Dan? Dan!

Dan McKinney! Are you with me?

Yeah. Yeah.

Good.

Alright. Come on.
The truck's right over here.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Sure you're up for this?

Yeah. Yeah.
Must be something I ate.

I'm good.

Dan!

Bob will answer any
questions you have.

-Great.
-Nothing's off limits.

-Is that true?
-It's what he says.

Scary thing to
say to a reporter.

It can be.

Hey!

That'll move 500,000 gallons
a day once we're running.

500?
That's right.

Can I get a photo?
Is that alright?

-Yeah, of course.
-Alright.

Let's get a photo of you.

You're looking good, Bob.

I'll be right here
if you need anything.

Okay. That's good. Thanks.

Bob, these workers,

they free for me to ask
them a couple questions?

One of them?
Yeah, sure. Hey, Frank!

It's not a cushy job
for them, is it?

Well, the boys
show up with nothing.

I mean, we give them a room,
something to eat,

they walk away with good money.

Some of 'em don't want to go.

-Really?
-Frank, meet Dan.

-He's doing a write up on us.
-How you doing?

Yeah, doing good.
How about yourself?

Nice to meet you.

He'd like to
ask you a few questions

-if you don't mind.
-Sure.

-You don't mind taking a break?
-Oh, no, not at all.

<i>How was your oil transported</i>

<i>before the pipeline?</i>

By train.

But, we had an oil train
headed to Tacoma catch fire

about a month ago.

The pipeline is
safer for everyone.

So you don't agree with
the protesters, I take it?

Let me put it to you
this way.

How'd they all get here?

Last I checked, America
still runs on oil.

Thanks.

Have you had any trouble?

With the protesters.

Off the record?

Yeah, you have my word.

We've had some trouble
with some of the workers

and some of the native women.

You should do some research.

What you got there?

A memento.
Must be your lucky day.

Yeah, I guess so.

Too bad you can't keep it.

Yeah.

You could actually keep it.

It's private land here,

but once we get
on the reservation

you're gonna have to leave it.

Okay.

You hungry?

Unfortunately, yeah.

I'm really glad
you're here, Dan.

I mean, the pipeline has
just been getting hammered

in the media.

Yeah, well, I mean, you didn't
expect chocolate and roses,

did you?

No, but I also didn't expect
a bunch of radical activists

to come and start provoking
the First Nation people.

That's what they
like to be called.

You know,
transporting oil is risky.

The question is, how do
you minimize the risk?

Are you asking
the mainstream media?

'Cause they got an answer.

Wind, solar, electric car.

Right now.

Maybe a time machine?

Time machine.
So we can go ahead 50 years

when we don't need oil anymore.

Yeah.

Pipelines are
safer than trains.

And both are safer than
not having enough oil.

In Iraq, what did
you see more of?

Weapons of mass
destruction or oil fields?

-Come on.
-Yeah.

So how many Iraq's
is it gonna take for us

to run this country?

More than a few.

Yeah.

You know,
with the tar sands up north,

and the shale in this country,

we have enough oil
to last a century.

-A century?
-Yeah.

But it's useless if
we can't move it.

You're with me, aren't you, Dan?

Well, I'm here writing
the story, aren't I?

Yeah.

I mean, I use as much
oil as anybody else.

And I know we can't turn
off the spigot right now,

but I'll be happy when we can.

I'll put it that way.

Agreed.
Okay.

Ah, thank you.

Is there anything
else you might need?

No, we're great. Thanks.

<i>The pipeline's original path</i>

<i>crossed the Missouri River</i>

<i>just north of Bismarck,</i>
<i>a city that is 90% white.</i>

<i>But when concerns were raised</i>

<i>about a potential</i>
<i>oil spill there,</i>

<i>the pipeline was</i>
<i>rerouted south--</i>

-Hello?
<i>-...to go under the river</i>

<i>right next to</i>
<i>the Standing Rock reservation.</i>

Ah, Yes, Dr. Lombard,
that was me.

Uh shoot.

It's just my wife
calling through,

I'll call her back.
What's up?

<i>10 days ago,</i>
<i>the tribe submitted evidence</i>

<i>of newly discovered</i>
<i>artifacts in burial sites--</i>

-Really?
<i>-...asking a state court</i>

<i>for an emergency injunction.</i>

<i>But, before the court</i>
<i>could make a decision,</i>

<i>bulldozers started</i>
<i>digging in that area.</i>

Water is life!
Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Stand back! Stand back!

You're all about to dig
on ancient burial ground!

All of this and all of you,

are in violation of
US Archaeological Law

and the Fort Laramie Treaties
upheld by the US Supreme Court.

We are your brothers
and your sisters.

We want peace!

Think about who will profit
from your actions.

Not your families.

Three, two--

Behind me,
pipeline security and police

are blocking
Native American protesters

for trying to protect
what they claim to be

is ancient burial ground.

A company who will
pollute your drinking water!

Leave this sacred land.

Oh my lord.
This is crazy.

-Was Dan there?
-I don't know.

I haven't heard from
him for a few days.

-You don't know if he's okay?
-No, I don't know.

I left him messages and texted

and he texted me back

saying that they
had bad reception.

Marty.

Great, bud, thanks for coming.

-You remember Marty Sherman?
-Marty.

-Head of security.
-Dan.

You met him first
day in the hangar.

Yes, good to see you again.

Alright.

He's just gonna ask
you a few questions.

Alright.

Noticed your
accent the other day.

You don't mind me
asking, where you from?

Biloxi, Mississippi.

Gulf Coast. You got some
good seafood down there.

Yes, sir.

I've been shrimping
since I was a kid.

Heck, I cook a mean gumbo.

Yeah, I believe you.

It's been a long day for us.

If you don't mind,
we're just gonna jump in.

Marty, is that alright?
Yeah.

Um...

Elliot told me about
the bulldozer incident.

Can you tell me a
little bit about that?

I understand you were there.

Uh, yeah.

Bunch of protesters got
upset about the bulldozer

and they gathered
down on the fence

on the company's land.

So they were trespassing,
gathering on the company's land?

Well, more like the road,
but yes sir.

And as soon as
we started digging,

they came across that
fence like crazy people.

They were firing arrows

and throwing pieces
of pipe and stuff.

Arrows like,

like shooting bows and arrows?

Yeah. I mean,
I know it sounds crazy,

but they had all kinds
of Indian feathers on

and they were
drummin', hollerin',

and they were screaming all
kinds of war chants, too.

They were really riled up.

What do you think
got 'em so riled up?

<i>They said that we were</i>
<i>digging up some old grave site,</i>

but we did surveys.

And there are
no bodies buried there.

<i>Do you have any photos</i>

<i>or video or anything</i>
<i>of the incident?</i>

<i>Be good to include</i>
<i>in the piece.</i>

I think we were all
a little bit too focused

on doing our jobs.

This operation is behind
schedule big time.

I just want to add

that I don't have anything
personal against them Indians,

<i>but you know, they just</i>
<i>gotta let bygones be bygones.</i>

All that stuff happened
hundreds of years ago.

And we just all
need to get along.

Thanks, Marty.

<i>Let me ask you,</i>

<i>the work you're doing,</i>

<i>you and your guys with</i>
<i>the sheriff's department,</i>

to what degree is it
a coordinated effort?

You know, Dan, that's a,

that's an excellent question.
Uh.

They're just both providing
tactical support to each other,

so this whole situation
with the protesters

doesn't get more outta
control than it already is.

Keep 'em in line.
Thanks a lot, Marty.

You've been really helpful.

Let's get you back to the hotel.

-Okay. Thank you Marty.
-Yes, sir.

-Nice to see you again.
-Good to see you.

You know, they prefer to
be called First Nation People

or the Sioux Tribe.

Sioux Tribe?
Yeah, it's just

a matter of respect.
Yes, sir.

Thanks again, Marty.
Thank you.

<i>Dan, the article is great.</i>

<i>Front page.</i>

Now listen, call me ASAP.

I have something else for you.

<i>Dan,</i>
<i>I've left you two messages.</i>

<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Please call me back.</i>

<i>We watched that crazy video.</i>

<i>Please,</i>
<i>let me know you're okay.</i>

<i>Please call me back.</i>

<i>Bye.</i>

Yeah, we're supposed
to be leaving now.

You know what?
My mom did it on her own

and we kind of turned out okay.

<i>Are you still there?</i>

Hi.

<i>Julie, are you okay?</i>

Hi.

I called you.

I kept calling you
and texting you,

and you never got
back to me. Why?

What is wrong with you?

I'm your fucking wife!

I don't--

We have class right now.

Are you coming?

Yes, of course.

I can't believe
you took a call,

a phone call, in the
middle of birthing class.

It was important, Julie.

More important than our baby?

I couldn't just ignore it.

Since when don't you
know how to ignore a call?

The paper wants me
back on the next flight.

Tonight.

Well, the paper is
not having your baby.

I am.

And you, you're just
somewhere else all the time.

And I don't mean
writing your article.

I put together a crib today.

Look at me.
I shouldn't be doing that.

We need the money, Julie.

They're doubling the pay.

Fine. Go.

You should go. It'll be good.

Come on.

I need a break.

<i>A push for US</i>
<i>military veterans is underway--</i>

<i>Hi, Dan McKinney.</i>

Thanks. Do you have a
North Dakota state map?

<i>...2,000 war</i>

<i>Their goal?</i>

No more

Come on, sister.

They just need showers.

Some of them came all
the way from New York.

Well, maybe
they shouldn't have.

Just give us a key to
one of the 100 empty rooms.

Can I help you, sir?

Yeah, I have
a reserved room, I think.

Dan McKinney.

Are you here to
redeem yourself

or make money for somebody else?

Excuse me?

Who do you work for?

Big Oil?

I'm a journalist.

Freelance.

This time for a
place out of Houston.

Mr. McKinney,
your room's ready.

Thank you.

Listen,

if your friends want to
take a shower in my room,

they can.

If you're quick about it,
I'm exhausted, I gotta sleep.

Well, what do you say, guys?

You wanna take charity
showers from Houston here?

At this point I would take
a shower from the Devil.

So.

So?

What's your wife's name?

Even without the ring,
you got that look.

Julie. And what's "the look"?

That unhappy,
I'm married, but...

searching for something look.

Yeah, I am searching
for something, but...

it's not what you think it is.

Hmm.

Kids?

Yep. One on the way.

So, soon-to-be-dad comes
to Standing Rock to do what,

exactly?

To write a story.

On what's happening.

Yeah, you and
every other <i>wasicu</i>

half your age with

What's <i>wasicu</i> ?

What?

I know one of the guys
who wrote this book.

<i>Walking the Medicine Wheel.</i>

Healing Trauma and PTSD.

It's research,
I was trying to...

learn a little something
before I got out here.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

Well, I got my

See ya.

<i>Clashes between</i>

I got a journalist heading
over in a black Nissan.

Go get this cleared
by the media stand.

Okay.

This guy.

Next.

Hey man, that thing's not
gonna do much good out here.

-What do you mean?
-The only place

you can get any service
is over there, on Facebook Hill.

-Yeah.
-I'm Fish, by the way.

Lucas Fisherman,
but people call me Fish.

Alright, Dan McKinney.

You in the service?

Yeah, Gaza Strip.
Peacekeeping with the 107th.

Next.
You a vet, too?

Yeah. Military journalist,

-Middle East, Iraq mostly.
-Okay.

Sit down, please.

Okay, who are you guys with?

Oh, lost my badge,

but I'm taking photos
for the Truth Riot guys.

You know Andy?

Okay.
He did mention you were coming.

Here, fill this out.

-And you?
-Freelance.

You have a press badge?

Yeah.

Driver's license?

Yeah.

How much longer
for these two guys?

A couple minutes.

Hurry up.

So you're gonna try and sell
a story about Standing Rock?

That just--that depends.

He's with me.

He's gonna donate the piece
he's writing to Truth Riot.

Is that right?

Well, if they'll have it.

You two are cleared.

Print your badges out while
Marion gives you the rundown.

Alright, thanks.

Not going in?

No, I gotta take off.

Okay. Thanks.

Yeah, no problem, man.

You know, they're just
suspicious of potential,

you know, infiltrators.

But, hey, I gotta jet.

See you later, brother.

Hey, sorry I'm late.

What's wrong?

Promise me...

you won't mention
this to anyone.

Anyone.

Yeah.

So newbies, here's the deal.

This is a nonviolent,
direct action protest.

Emphasis on nonviolent. Clear?

Our council elders had a call

with our lawyers in
Washington, DC last night.

They cannot stop the pipeline.

So raise your hand
if you've ever been

on the front lines of
a direct action before.

Okay, This is for all of
you, but especially you.

Under no circumstances
do you throw anything

at pipeline security
or a policeman.

And do not provoke them
in any way whatsoever.

Is that clear?

Okay.

So, we're on the front lines

and somebody grabs you.

What's the first
thing that you do?

Ask somebody for help?

No, you need to throw your
camera to somebody on our side.

You need to protect the truth.

You have a responsibility
to tell the truth

about what's going on here.

You are responsible.

Each and every one of you.

<i>Ch'unkshi.</i>

Strong warriors...

never stand down.

Even in the face of defeat.

Mary, it's your turn.

<i>Toksa.</i>

I am here to welcome you

to the land of my ancestors
and the coming generations

of the Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux.

This is Sacred Land.

This whole camp is
a prayer ceremony.

I am asking you to honor
and respect our cultures

and our traditions.

Now, if you agree to this,
raise your hands.

<i>Oh'a</i> . Good.

How 'bout we do a quick
review of The Black Snake.

Based on previous
catastrophic leaks,

the most likely future leaks

are going to be right here

and right here.

<i>When that does happen,</i>

it could possibly poison
the water supply for

maybe 10 or 20 million people.

That is why you are here.

<i>You are the water protectors.</i>

<i>Mni Wiconi.</i>

Water is life.

Alright, Marion's gonna give you
your volunteer assignments.

Do you mind,
can I take a photo of that?

Be my guest.

Okay.

Uh, Bill and Roger,
you're on chopping wood.

Brandy and Alexa, you are
helping in the medic tent.

And you, Dan, you're on dishes.

Which actually starts
in 10 minutes, so.

Sorry. Wait, wait, sorry.

The journalists are--
are--are expected

to volunteer at the camp?

Yeah, it's kind of the thing.

Do you need help
finding the mess tent?

Ladies?

Do you think one of you could
show him where the mess tent is?

Yeah, fine, I'll babysit.

Come on.

<i>Washte.</i>

<i>Washte.</i>

All these people
were just moved here.

Well, I hope you're not
allergic to hard work, Houston.

So it's just right over there.

Okay.

<i>Toksa akhe.</i>

Sorry, what?

It's our way of
saying farewell.

It means later again.

I like that. Took-shack?

<i>- Toksa akhe.</i>
Our ancestors...

<i>-Toksa akhe.</i>
-...followed the buffalo.

-In a sacred hoop they roamed.
<i>-Toksa akhe.</i>

<i>- Toksa akhe.</i>
<i>- Tatanka</i> was our

source of life.

Their flesh,
their hide, their bone.

To the north, south,
east, and west,

you could hear their stampede.

We are the <i>tatanka</i> .

Our skin, our blood, our creed.

Uh, hello again.

You hungry?

Uh, you know, I don't think so.

But I'm ready to do
some dish washing.

<i>Oh'a.</i>

This way.

Hey. Terry, Navy.

Dan, Army.

You just get here?

Yeah, more or less.
What gave me away?

You looked like
you just woke up, homes.

Yeah, well, guess it's
not what I thought it'd be.

What'd you expect?

Bunch of Indians on horses
shooting bow and arrows?

Yeah, maybe.

Probably too many
westerns as a kid.

Yeah, well,

there's some young people
here who want to fight, but

most of us know that
fighting won't get you too far.

We gotta be peaceful
on this.

The Black Snake is a sign
that it's time for us all to

come together.

What's The Black Snake?

The Black Snake,
the oil pipeline.

Predicting prophecy
for generations.

When the black snake
crosses the land,

a time of great
trouble will begin.

What kind of great trouble?

Let's just say
it won't be good.

<i>Andy from Truth Riot here.</i>

<i>Don't believe</i>
<i>what you're hearing</i>

<i>from the mainstream media.</i>

<i>This is what's really going on.</i>

<i>Watch the video</i>
<i>and please share.</i>

<i>Can you say what you</i>
<i>just said, but slower?</i>

<i>It's absurd how these</i>
<i>people are being treated.</i>

<i>They're being treated like</i>
<i>second class citizens,</i>

<i>and this has been</i>
<i>going on for years.</i>

It's not right.

There is legal precedent
to stop this pipeline.

The Historic Preservation Act
protects the site,

as does the US Constitution.

<i>The Lakota People's Law Project</i>
<i>intends to seek damages,</i>

<i>as well as putting</i>
<i>an injunction</i>

<i>on the pipeline itself.</i>

<i>Anything else?</i>

-No, I have a meeting to get to.
-Great. Thank you.

Alright.

Hi. Excuse me.
You're an attorney?

Yes. And you are?

Dan McKinney, journalist.

What did you mean
the land is

protected by
the US Constitution?

You know, I gotta run, but...

I'll tell you what,
you come by my room

in an hour,
I'll explain it to you.

-Okay. Where?
-203.

Alright. Thank you.

Hello?

<i>Oh, hey. Yeah, come on in.</i>

Make yourself a place to
sit there. I'm on the phone.

Right.

You heard what I said, right?

No.

Okay. I want you to get
a title search going.

I want you to find
out who owns the land

and then I want you to
get back to me, alright?

No, I'm not mad.

Alright.

Alright.

Okay.
Thank you, bye.

Busy night?

The pipelines have hired
private security thugs

that just bag anybody
that they deem a threat.

What are these
treaty lands here?

Alright, well,

the part in yellow...

there, that was granted

<i>as part of the</i>
<i>Fort Laramie Treaties</i>

<i>with the federal government.</i>

<i>Now there were two.</i>
<i>There was one in 1851</i>

<i>and one in 1868.</i>

But downstairs,

you said protected
by the Constitution.

Yes.

Okay, this is Article VI
of the US Constitution.

Read the underlined bit.

"This Constitution...
and all treaties made,

or which shall be made,

under the Authority
of the United States,

shall be the supreme
Law of the Land."

In other words, the founding
fathers included these treaties

because they wanted these
land deals to be honored.

Everything you see there,

on that map,

legally belongs to
the Sioux Nation.

These treaties,

and they're still valid?

Supreme Court, 1980,

the <i>Sioux Nation v</i>
<i>the United States</i> ruled

that the land was
illegally taken

from the Sioux by
the US government.

1980?

So if that's correct,
the pipeline--

Crosses Sioux treaty land.

And not just that pipeline,

but a lot of oil, gas,
uranium operations.

What do you think?

Do you think these companies
want to go to federal court?

Ah, duty calls.

Hello? Yeah.

Um, okay. Yeah, we can do that.

We can go over the deposition.

Yes. I know it's serious.

Hold on.

It's good to meet you.

Thank you.

Good luck.
Thanks.

<i>Hey, buddy, it's Elliot.</i>

Uh, again.

<i>I left you a message.</i>
<i>Give me a buzz.</i>

Huh, you're alive.

Hi.

<i>Hi.</i>

How are you?

I'm still pregnant.

It's feeling really real now,

with the little bath
and bottles and toys.

Jules.

<i>Hmm?</i>

I'm...

<i>sorry I left the way I did.</i>

Dan,

<i>are you okay?</i>

Yeah.

Yeah. I just,

<i>actually, I just miss you.</i>

<i>- </i> <i>When are you done?</i>
Shouldn't be long.

I just need to move to
the camp for a few days.

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Wait, what? Seriously?

You said, you promised.

<i>I saw those videos.</i>

You promised me that you
would not put yourself

in harm's way.

<i>How many episodes have</i>
<i>you had this month, Dan?</i>

How long have you known?

I gotta go.

Dan the man!

Awesome that you're joining
us on this historic day.

Hey, Fish.

Can I give
you a hand with that?

No, I got it.

Actually, yeah.

I'm not gonna say
no to some help.

I got you covered.

So with all these
vets coming through,

I bet you're getting pretty
stoked about your article.

Uh, yeah. You know,

I'm still...still looking for
the right perspective for it,

you know.

Oh, dude, I'm late.

I gotta go. I'll see you at
the Forgiveness Ceremony?

Uh, yeah, that's--
Wait, that's today?

Four PM tonight, man.
Do not miss it.

History is being made tonight.

Okay. Got it.

Alright.

-Okay.
-Thanks.

-I'll see you tonight, man.
-Thanks.

<i>Hau, Mitakuye Oyasin.</i>

In the sacred hoop of life,

there is no beginning
and no ending.

Our prophecies tell us that
we are now at a crossroads.

We must unite spiritually,

or we will face chaos.

We came.

We fought you.

We took your land.

We signed treaties
that we broke.

We took your children.

We have come to say
that we are sorry,

and we are at your service,

and we beg you for
your forgiveness.

<i>Oh'a.</i>

Howdy, Houston.

A little jumpy, aren't you?

Where'd you come from?

Oh, the sky.

No, I was just...

lost in the landscape, it's...

I could see how

you'd wanna fight for this.

You wanna see what's
really going on?

Meaning?

Midnight.

Just you.

No camera.

Okay.

-Alright?
-Alright.

See you, Houston.

See ya.

This could take a while.

What's your story?

I told you mine.

Yeah, a version of your story.

Okay, tell me
a version of yours.

Uh, my reservation
is a ways away, but...

when I heard they moved the
pipeline to cross here I said

I would do whatever it took
to stop The Black Snake.

Kissed my kids and husband--

Wait, you're a mom?

Yeah.

And I just got in the car
and I drove here.

How long ago was that?

About six months ago.

Since you got here have
you had any problems or...

run-ins...

with the private security or...

police?

Sorry, didn't mean to pry.

Two weeks ago,

water protectors
had formed a line in

the pipeline's path so.

And the sheriff's
department arrived and...

They shot a percussion grenade
and hit a kid in the leg.

And then,

they grabbed an elder
and began beating her.

And they beat us,

zip tied us and took us to a
hill overlooking construction.

And for hours, they made
us watch bulldozers destroy

our burial grounds.

They took us to this,
like a huge garage,

and inside were dog kennels.

And they wrote on
us with Sharpies.

With Sharpies.

I was number 236.

And then they put us
in those kennels.

Like dogs.

I'm so sorry.

Did you know that

if a non-Native commits
a crime on the reservation,

we can't prosecute?

<i>So we get all these</i>
<i>construction camps,</i>

<i>oil workers.</i>

Well, you can just about imagine
what they do to our women.

There's the snake.

It loos so different.

Compared to what?

There's a lot more
military vehicles.

We gotta go tell
the council ASAP.

<i>Where did you find this again?</i>

At a pipeline
construction site

near the Standing Rock
Reservation,

in the Dakotas.

Strange.

<i>Why's that?</i>

Construction
companies are required

to do archaeological surveys.

Usually a find this rare
would be with other artifacts.

Like in a burial ground?

<i>Certainly that's one option.</i>

And how old is it?

Around 1,500 years old.

You're kidding me.

We had the lab carbon date it.

It is an important find.

Any chance we could
come down there

and do a proper survey
of the area?

I seriously doubt it.

Listen, I gotta run.

Can you email me a copy
of that lab report?

Actually, I'm required to
send the artifact back to you

and I'll include
the report with it.

Okay, great. Thank you.

Offenses include attacking a
police helicopter with drones,

unlawful use of weapons,

unlawful creation of explosives,

and establishing an
illegal roadblock.

The various activities
resulted in 127 new arrests.

What's been the cost of this
operation to the taxpayers?

We're estimating upwards
of 10 million dollars.

Sheriff, are you aware of
the influx of US veterans

joining the water protectors?

Yes. We're aware of them.

Many of our veterans are very,

very vulnerable to exploitation.

We just...

strongly discourage our

returning soldiers from
misinterpreting the situation.

So are you saying
that they're incapable

of interpreting it correctly?

This is a very
emotional situation.

It's very easy to get confused.

At the end of the day,

we're simply here to
protect and serve the law.

Sorry, sheriff, uh,

the law?

The Sioux Nation has appealed

the federal government's
violation of land treaties.

Shouldn't the construction
be suspended

until that matter is resolved?

To the best of my knowledge,

all the work has
been sanctioned.

If we're told otherwise,
by the courts,

we'll take appropriate action.

You're a hard man
to get a hold of.

Well, I've been focused
on the story.

Well, it looks like
it's going great.

I don't like
being manipulated.

<i>They've invented a story</i>

<i>about crazed protesters</i>
<i>and weapons in camp</i>

<i>and propane tank explosives.</i>

<i>They have</i>
<i>legitimate evidence</i>

<i>for everything on that list.</i>

Forensic, drone footage.
This is serious, Dan.

<i>Look, they wanna</i>
<i>charge the protesters, great.</i>

<i>Do it.</i>
<i>But do it legitimately.</i>

<i>You know what's legitimate?</i>

<i>Our right to build there.</i>

This is a nation of laws.

And the law's on our side
when it comes to this.

The law says these
people get screwed.

The tribe's known
about this for two years.

400 meetings.

Do you know how many
comments we got back?

Two.

They didn't care.

Where's the oil going, Elliot?

It's not going to
US consumers, is it?

It's all going overseas.

Competing with OPEC
is national security.

We're about to be

a net exporter

of oil and gas for
the first time in decades.

That is energy independence.

And at what cost?

Where are you going?

I was hired to find
out what's going on.

No, no, you were hired
by us to write a story.

I was hired to find
out what's going on.

You moved the pipeline

right to the mouth
of the reservation

under the widest
point of the river

at their only water source.

We destroyed their past.

But you're destroying
their future.

Yeah?
<i>- I need to know.</i>

Is he a liability?

Yeah, he's a problem.

He's off the reservation.

<i>That's not funny, Elliot.</i>

No, I know it's not funny.

These articles are
now being reviewed

by the State Department.

They're calling it an
issue of national security.

We can't have him
turning the tables on us.

Hi, Terry. What's up?

They know who you are, Dan.

-And they want to meet with you.
-Okay.

Before we go in there,
let me just explain--

They wanna meet with you now,
<i>iktÃ³mi.</i>

You gotta come with us.
<i>Hiyupo.</i>

We all gotta face our demons.

Sit down.

We take infiltrators
seriously.

I understand.
Please, just let me explain--

Who wrote this article?

That was before
I knew any of you.

Did you write it or not?

Will you please let me
explain what I'm--

Oh yes, please explain
to the poor Natives.

How stupid do you think we are?

Did you really think that
you could live with us,

eat with us, pray with us,

and we would never
figure out who you were

or what you were doing?

The first piece,
I wrote for <i>The Daily</i> , yes.

I toured the pipeline facility.

Yes, and I saw what
they wanted me to,

and I wrote pretty much
what they wanted me to.

But then they sent me back here.

And I see things
differently this time.

I do.

And I'm trying to
tell the truth.

I'm trying to help.

There is somebody
that you helped.

Chetan's been arrested
for that drone flight.

That's not even--
but how's that possible?

Hey, Mika,

something's going
down at the bridge.

They need you now.

<i>Inahni yo!</i>

<i>Oh'a, iktÃ³mi.</i>

<i>Oh'a, iktÃ³mi.</i>

Tricky Spider.

Traitor.

Pack your things.

<i>Shots fired! Shots fired!</i>

<i>You don't care</i>
<i>about the truth, Ricky.</i>

<i>You're just in this</i>
<i>to make a buck.</i>

How 'bout putting yourself
in my shoes for a moment?

87 soldiers from

Houston alone have died
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<i>Oh, come on, Ricky.</i>

Including my nephew.

Truth is, down the road,

15 people died trying
to refine that oil

<i>and 23 more before that.</i>

<i>The truth is,</i>

<i>what kind of fuel</i>
<i>is in your car?</i>

How much fuel did
you burn this year?

This month, this week?

<i>Give me a break, Ricky.</i>

There are two sides
to every story.

The side you see

and the side you don't.

And it is my job

to show you
the alternative side.

Damn it!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

What are you doing?

Are you trying to kill us?

We came here to peacefully pray.

Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!
Water is life! Water is life!

Water is life! Water is life!

<i>And for hours they made</i>
<i>us watch bulldozers destroy</i>

<i>our burial grounds.</i>

<i>You're with me,</i>
<i>aren't you, Dan?</i>

<i>Come back.</i>

<i>All this stuff happened</i>
<i>hundreds of years ago.</i>

<i>We just all need to get along.</i>

<i>We all gotta</i>
<i>face our demons.</i>

<i>A time of</i>
<i>great trouble will begin.</i>

<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>it won't be good.</i>

This is for you.

This is for you.
