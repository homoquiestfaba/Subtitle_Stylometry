[people chattering]

Hi.

Thanks for lunch.

I'm really glad you guys
got to see the new clinic.

Are you kidding?

Think we'd come to Boston
and not see our girl?

We're so proud of you.

Hey, Phil, I need your help
on my cadaver.

Okay.

I've been trying, like, for six hours
to find the posterior thoracic nerve,

and if I don't dig it up soon,
Lenhoff is gonna cut me open.

Yeah, I know.
Posterior thoracic is a bitch.

Um, I need-- I need--
Janet.

Janet, love, we need you.
Come here.

Why don't I like
the sound of that?

It's all in the interest
of science, dear.

Trust me?
Sure.

Put your left hand up.

Tom, pay attention.

You just dig behind--
Sorry my hands are cold.

Dig behind
the scalenus medius,

then you move aside
the brachial plexus,

and then slide down
to the serratus anterior.

And there you have it--
posterior thoracic.

You finished, Philip?
Yes.

I thank

Science thanks you.
Tom here thanks you.

I thank you.

I gotta go. Study, okay?

Sure.

Any thoughts on why

we're seeing
shortness of breath,

lethargy and dizziness
in a 7-year-old?

Eisenmenger's syndrome.

I mean, that would go with
the pulmonary hypertension.

Mr. Markoff.

But assuming your hypothesis
is correct,

why are we seeing
the low heart rate,

and diminished reflex,
and a lack of affect?

Perhaps the fact that a
7-year-old boy is alone

and his parents wouldn't bother to be
with him when he's in the hospital.

Hmm. Personalizing, Philip?

No, sir.

Here you are, baby.
I had to go all the way

to the CVS on Commonwealth
to get you the cherry kind.

It'll be right here waiting
for you when you wake up.

Ah. There's a lesson
for you all.

Things are not always
what they appear to be,

and even
the remarkable Mr. Markoff

isn't perfect.


All right, guys.
Next patient.

I only torture you,

because when
every major hospital

comes clamoring for you to
do your residency with them,

I want you to realize
that this place

recognizes your talent

and is gonna push you
to be even better.

Also, I-- Well, I kind
of like torturing you.


Oh.
Sorry.

Don't turn around.

Uh, what part of "Don't turn"
didn't you understand?
Oh, sorry.

Um, he is locked in.

Um, I think he's
looking at you.

Uh, no. He is definitely
looking at you.

I don't think so.

Damn.

He could not get cuter

if he was holding
a teddy bear and a puppy.

[Doctor
Mr. Markoff?

Yes?
We need your genius.

He li-i-ikes you.



Butene...


Cyclooctene...

Antiaromatic.

Ah, aromatics are tough.

Yeah.


Um, I can never figure out

which electrons to put where.

You wanna know a trick?
Don't memorize, diagram.

I'm Philip, by the way.
Markoff.

We actually--
We met the other day for a second.

Well, we didn't really meet.
We just kind of bumped.

Yeah.

Um, I'm Megan...McAllister.

So that's cool.

You're-- You're helping out
at the clinic.

Yeah. And you're, uh,
going to med school.

That I am.

That's cool, too.

Yeah, I should really be going,
'cause I have to study.

I have this huge test
in 17 hours.

Whoa. You've got a test
tomorrow, and you are studying?

Yeah.
That's what people do.

No, not me.

Um,

okay, so what do you think
should be doing?

I think you should be cutting
loose, airing out your brain.

Right. Right.

So, when I fail
the test tomorrow,

can I write that theory in
at the essay portion

of my medical school
applications?

Uh, so you're--

Where-- Where you applying?

Here, he asks hopefully?

Hmm?

Um, probably Brent.

I probably won't get in.
Um...

They really would be
lucky to have you.

You don't even know me.
Oh, my God. That's true.

Wow. Okay. Come on.
I'll quiz you on the way.

On the way where?
729. I got your page number.

On the way to the place I always
go the night before an exam.

Uh, you know what?
I really have to study,

and I'm--
I'm not that, you know,

"run away with a guy I've only known
for 30 seconds" type of girl, so...

Okay.
[clears throat]

Um, okay.

SUNY Albany,
<i>summa cum laude.</i>

Uh, B.U. med school,

second year,
top 5% of my class.

Not bragging.
I love animals. I don't like birds, though.

I am an unapologetic member
of the Young Republicans,

but I also don't really
like to talk politics.

Uh, sometimes
I work too hard.

And when I was little,

I really hated wearing
full-length pants.

Strange. I know.

And, um,

in case you haven't noticed,
I really like you.

So I'll pick you up
at 8:00?

I, um--
I have to change.

Don't do that. Never do that.
I like you just the way you are.

I meant my clothes.

Right. Clothes.

All right. I'll pick
you up at 7:30, then.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.
So the trick to roulette,

or at least my theory is
you gotta feel the numbers.

You've gotta really, really kind
of get in sync with the wheel.

Are you hearing yourself
right now?

Yeah, it works. Watch.
Here. I'll show you.

Final bets, please.
Place your bets.

Is this you hearing
or feeling the number?

Mm-hmm.

Last chance, people.
I got it.

Black 22.

Oh!
Oh.

Red 12.
I don't think that theory works.

Or maybe someone was distracting me.
Oh, so now it's my fault?

Yes, of course, it was your fault.
Fine. Blame it on me.

You're a bad person.

Your drinks, sir.
Oh.

Thank you.

Oh, my gosh.
That's a very pink drink.

I have to be good.
It's a school night.

All right.
Trust me, though.

The rush is gonna
be good for you,

and it releases
the endorphins,

gets your brain working.

Cyclopropene.

Um, aromatic?

There you go.
All right. Here we go.

See? You know this stuff.
You just gotta trust yourself.

Okay.
Oh, okay.

Take these.
Here we go.

Close your eyes.
Okay.

And really
feel them.

Feeling them.
Right.

Last chance. Final bets.
I want 7.

Red 7.
Yes.

Oh, my God!

Whoa. Red 7. We got a winner here.
That's insane.

Look at that.

Oh, my God.
Wow.


I know this is probably
way too late,

but you're not dating
anyone, right?

Well, I was dating
Leonardo DiCaprio,

and then he moved to Hollywood
and got all famous, so I dumped him.

Right.
Yeah.

So I think we're good.

What are you doing for lunch?
When?

I don't know.
The next 50, 60 years?

Well, I have to check my book,
Okay.

but...

Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

What? Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

Hi.

Mmm.
Mmm.

Welcome home.

Yay!
All right.

Let's go inside. It's cold.
You're still cold?

Ooh. Heat. Yay.

You cold?
Yeah.

Give me your hands.

My mom used to do this to keep
my hands warm when I was little.

It warms them up.

This may be
the cutest thing ever.


Mmm.
Mmm.

Have you told your parents
we've moved in together yet?

Philip, I'm--

Look, it's important
to you, okay?

So it's important to me.

I know And I'm gonna
tell them. I promise.

I just don't
wanna deal with the...

"You're so young.

"You've only known him
for six months.

Are you sure about this?"
Blah, blah, blah.

But I promise you
I'm gonna tell them.

Okay.

Hey, I have an idea.
Uh-oh.

How about we stop unpacking,
Mm-hmm.

order Chinese food,
and study together?

Well, that sounds nice.

But I got
a study group tonight

I got to go to.

Microanatomy.

Boo.
Right?

And the worst part is

it's probably gonna
go all night,

so I wouldn't wait up
for me either.

But we can celebrate tomorrow.

I'm a med school widow already.
I knew this would happen.

Stop it.

Well, can you at least
drop these off for me?

What, are those
applications?

Yep. I only have
one more to go.

All right, all right.
Well...

you're getting into B.U.,
so I wouldn't stress it.


I like you.

I like you, too.

Do you really have to go?
Yeah, I do.

But I will kiss you right
when I get home, okay?
Yeah.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Bye.

Bye.


I feel like a tourist.

squint your eyes

and then pretend
you're in Paris.

[speaks French]

Say what?

It means I'm freezing
my butt off.

Oh, does it?

Here. Get in here.
What are you doing?

How's that?
Is that better?

Mmm. Much better.
Thank you.

You're welcome.
You can start calling me Pocket.

What's in here?

Driver, will you stop
the carriage for a second?

What's going on?
You trust me?

Should I?

Megan McAllister,

I love you
with all of my heart.

Will you marry me?

Philip, there's nothing I want
more than to marry you, but...

But what?

I haven't
even graduated yet.

and you're still in med school, and
you haven't even met my parents.

Well, let's go.
Right now.

Tonight. We can leave this second.
We'll go to New Jersey.

Driver, do you think this horse
can make it to New Jersey?

I think the horse is gonna get really
tired and sick, but then we'll drive.

They're gonna go crazy.

Babe,
I know this might sound

a little old-fashioned,

but I really want
their blessing.

I want them
to be happy for us.

I love you so much.

I love you, too.

<i>â™ª [pop]</i>

Philip,
it's just my parents.

It's gonna be fine.
They're gonna love you.

<i>â™ª [continues]</i>

Oh, Megan.
Hey.

Hi.

Oh, honey, hi, hi.

Mom, Dad, this is Philip.

Hello, Philip.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

I was told you like
roses, Mrs. McAllister.

My weakness. Thank you.

And please, call me Susan.

Susan.
Ahem.

And I'm told your weakness
is Pinot grigio.

I guess my secret is out.

I haven't had this one.

Thank you.

So, let's go inside.

Lunch should be ready
any moment.

Yeah.
Come on in.


Wow, Philip--
you really must rate.

Mom doesn't bring out
the silver for just anybody.

it just seems a shame

to keep something
so pretty...

[conversation drowns out]

Philip? Philip.

Philip?
Yeah.

Thank you,
I'd love some.

Mmm. Looks so good.

[clears throat]

So, uh, Mr. McAllister--

Uh-uh-uh-uh.

I'm sorry. Um, David--
Better.

I hear that you have
an awesome short game.

You play?
Oh, yeah.

Mr. McAllister, you know
why we came here today.

Yes, I do, and...

I'm sure you can imagine some
of the questions I have.

Absolutely. I mean,
what's the rush, right?
Yeah.

Aren't you too young?
Mm-hmm.

What about your studies?

And how do I know
I can trust you

with the person that I care about
the most in all the world?

Yeah, that--
that about sums it up.

Well, sir, with me,

what you see is
pretty much what you get.

I grew up near Syracuse,

parents split
when I was a kid.

Not rich, no handouts.

I had to work my way
through school.

<i>Summa cum laude</i>
from SUNY Albany.

And I love your
daughter very much.

You sound like
the American Dream.

Isn't that
a good thing, sir?

Mr. McAllister...

I would like very much to
spend the rest of my life

making Megan happy.

You know,
there's no rush.

You guys could live
together for a bit,

really get to know
each other.

We <i>have</i> been living
together for a bit.

Really?

I mean, it just works
great, you know?

He's amazing, and he's
at the top of his class,

and he helps me,
and we study together.

And it's crazy, but...

we're just great
for each other.

He'll still charge you.

That's exactly right--
by the hour.

Megan, you managed
to find a young man

capable of crushing it
300 yards off the tee

and keeping it in
the middle of the fairway.

[overlapping chatter]

Okay.
Okay.

Bye, baby.

Love you, too.
Nice meeting you guys.

Drive safely.
Okay.


I told you.
I told you, Pocket.

It's gonna be happily
ever after for you and me.

It's amazing.

Ha ha!

Okay, so...
Huh?

Ask me again.
What?!

Come on, please
ask me again.

All right.
[clears throat]

Megan McAllister, I love
you with all my heart.

Yes!
Will you marry--


Yes, yes.
Okay.

Mmm.

That was fast.

Well, I couldn't wait
to meet you.

Mmm, charmer.

I like that.

Oh, it's great. Big smile.

Is my tie okay?
Yeah.

Some of this?

Can you remind me why--
what this is for again?

It's for the web site.

We have a web site?

It's going to be
a pink web site.

Yes.

Smiling.

What happened?

Oh! You look like
Ken and Barbie.

Did he say Ken and Barbie?
Yeah.

Is he making fun of us?
No, it's cute.

Hey, great.

You're a beautiful couple.

You're a beautiful couple.

to be the wedding web site

to end all
wedding web sites.

Babe, this is
looking so cute!

Hey, oh,
are you busy?

No, I'm not busy at all.
I'm just looking at genetic notes.

But go ahead. Tell me
about this web site.

Well, it's going to be where we're
registered and everything, obviously.

But then there's going
to be pictures

and there's ing
to be a countdown.

It's like a rocket launch.

There's gonna be a quiz
for all our friends to take

to see how well
they know us.

Doesn't really matter
how well other people know us.

It's about how well
we know each other.

God, I like you.

I like you, too.
We should get married.

Ha ha! I'm so excited to
finally meet your family.

Um...babe, I wanted to talk
to you about that, okay?

I talked to them, and I don't know if
they're going to be able to make it.

What are you
talking about?

It's our engagement party.
I know.

Philip, we're
getting married.

Don't you think
it's strange

that I haven't met
your family?

Well, we're
a strange family.

We're all nice
to you now, Philip,

but if you mess with
our little sister--

Yeah, okay, I promise--
I will be good.

You have nothing to worry about.
You better be.

Hey, what are you doing
with my fiancÃ©?

Nothing. No,
they're just scaring

the ever-living crap
out of me.

We like this guy.

I told you--
he's a good one.

And look--I found
my maid of honor.

Ah, one of 19.

Not to mention
the three flower girls,

the two ring bearers--

But you're my favorite.
Thank you.

No, I know it's not all
about just the one day.

It's about spending
the rest of my life...

Sorry, can you guys
excuse me for a second?

Yeah.

Now, which one of you boys
wants to get me a drink?

Philip.

Oh, it's so good
to see you.

Oh, this house--
it's so beautiful.

It's--

Philip...
Philip what?

Hey, I didn't scare you off with
all the wedding talk, did I?

No, no, no.
Okay, sorry.

I'm Philip's mother.

Oh, my gosh!

It's so nice
to finally meet you!

My parents cannot wait

to introduce you to everyone.
This is--

Okay, don't move.
I'll be right back.

I'll be right back.

She's very beautiful.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, I see your father's, huh?

He's already good friends
with the McAllisters?

You're still keeping
score, huh, Mom?

You know, if it makes you
feel any better,

Dad's never met them
before today, either, okay?

The happy family
together again.

Well, I-- I'm not
seeing your brother,

so I'm guessing that
he wasn't invited.

Guess whatever you want.

[overlapping chatter]

[music and chatter
drowns out]

[camera clicks]

[camera clicking]

So, I was thinking,
for every day,

we could do the Kate Spade
Sag Harbor dinner plates

in the polka dots,

and then the salad
plates in stripes,

because the stripes and the polka
dots look really good together.

Especially on the deck
of our beautiful beach house

that we're gonna have one day.
Nice.

And, for when we invite the
head of the hospital over--

who neither one of us
can stand--

I was thinking we could do
the Royal Doulton Etoile,

or the Spode India Tree.
What do you think?

Oh, well, I think the guy that
comes up with these names

has way too much time
on his hands, personally.

the countdown going. Look.

I mean, I know
it's cheesy,

but 's cute,
right?

you gotta have it.

Mm-hmm.

And it's in pink.

Jan--Janet,
a friendly face.

That is exactly
what I needed.

You're in scrubs?
You look cute.

Where were you today?
You missed a bunch of stuff on test.

I missed a lot of stuff.
But I don't really-- I don't care.

Because I've got you,
and you're gonna give me notes.

Because you're
a good friend.

Sorry, friend.
No, wait, wait, wait.

Ohh!
Philip, you're drunk.

We're friends, right?
Sure, we're friends.

But you're getting
a little close.

Philip, stop.

What--Come on.
No, knock it off!

Don't you say no to me.

Yeah? Watch me.
Really?

What's wrong with you?

What would your fiancÃ©e
say about this

if she found out about you?

Ohh!
What did you say?

You threatening me?

Uh--

Uh...

Rhinestones.
Oh, okay.

Um...

Wow.

Does that come with
a light switch?

Let's look at
some other dresses.


disposable phones,

the ones that can't be traced
or tracked, anything like that?

Yeah, no I.D.,
no nothing.

All right, thanks.

It's a lot of dress.

I like the way it moves.

Really?
Moves?

It's like a tsunami.

Ohh.
Oh, my God.

I am never
getting married.

When you meet someone who makes you
feel like Philip makes me feel--

and you will--
you'll do anything

to show him
how much you love him--

even wear a tsunami dress.

Oh, wow, okay.

We've got cakes to taste.
Go, get changed.

Quickly, quickly.
We have to go!

Don't touch anything.
We'll be back in an hour.

We are going to find a dress.
Yes, we are.


[cell phone beeps]

Mmm.
This is good.

Oh, that's yummy.
You like it?

Mm-hmm.
Megs...

you cannot go with this one.
Why not?

Because all of your guests
will die of pleasure,

and you will have that
on your conscience.

I'm serious.
This is so good.

Let me see.
It's perfect.

[cell phone beeps]
Mmm!

It's so good.

It's like
raspberry something.

Oh, you guys, look.

My fiancÃ© misses me.

Aww, he's the best
boyfriend ever.

Just a little bit
more of that.


Looks like a very
interesting project.

Yep.

You can put my number in any
of these phones, if you want.


30, 32.

Hope it's not
much longer.

I know. Let's hope
that she--

Wow.

Good one?

Staggering. Wow.

I just want you
to love it.

You are going to be the most
beautiful bride ever.

I'm getting married!

[cheers and laughter]

Congratulations!

It's great.
This is the one for sure.

I'll need to see
some I.D.

That's me, man.

Brian Stevens.

Yeah.

[no audible dialogue]

Hey, Phil.
Hey, man. How you doing?

Janet, can I talk
to you for a sec?

Uh, sure.
Cool.

So, listen, I just wanted to
apologize for the other night,

'cause I was really drunk.
No, I was out of line.

Forget it.
And it's not okay.

But I just want
to let you know--

if you even think about messing
with me and my fiancÃ©e,

I swear to God--

You understand?

Okay.
Yeah.

All right. Good.

Okay.

All right.

[clears throat]

All right, guys, I'm out.
Got to get to class.

Later dude.
All right, see you.

And that concludes

the scintillating
video portion

of our presentation.

You will see
that offspring 4

is not sharing the same
characteristics

with offspring 7.

Mr. Markoff,
from which parent

did offspring 4
receive chromosome 13?

The father, obviously.
That locus is linked

to congenital blindness, which
doesn't appear in the maternal line.

Nobody likes a smartass,
Mr. Markoff. Thank you.

All right, any questions?
Yes, sir.

STUDENT:
This genetic condition--


Philip,
call me back, please.

I just tried to
take out some cash,

and it says the account
is overdrawn.

Don't worry about it.
I'll pay, my treat.

Hey, baby it's me.
Can you call me back? Bye.

I'm sure there's
an explanation.

You should call
the bank or something.

ATMs screw up
all the time.

I've called Philip
three times

in the past hour, and he
hasn't called me back.

He's probably in class.

I'm telling you,
it's just a bank screw-up.

You guys are starting
a life together, Megs.

If you're gonna marry him,
you have to trust him.

Okay?

Hey.

The strawberry is great.
Ooh.

[cell phone rings]

See? Drama queen.

Hello? Where have you been?
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

<i>I'm at the dean's</i>
<i>office right now.</i>

Listen, Megan,
I'm so sorry

about the whole
money thing.

I got this N.I.H. grant,
and the check came late,

but I'm getting it
Monday morning,

<i>so I'll put the money</i>
<i>back in the account</i>

<i>first thing, okay?</i>

No, it's okay.
I mean...yeah.

No, no, no, no.
I'm totally serious.

<i>We're supposed to be</i>
<i>a team, you know?</i>

I want us to be able
to tell each other everything.

No secrets.
Look, sweetheart, I gotta let you go.

<i>But I wanted to call</i>
<i>and let you know</i>

<i>that I am very sorry.</i>
<i>Your fiancÃ© is a big, dumb idiot,</i>

and that it's all
taken care of.

Okay.

I love you so much.
<i>I love you, too.</i>

Bye.


Yay!

To my best friend's
wedding.

Mmm, Red Sox, huh?

My favorite team.
Come on in.

You got some mail.

Oh.

It's from B.U.

Ooh, hello,
Dr. McAllister.

It's really thin.
Open it.

"Dear Miss McAllister,
thank you for this application. We--"


No?

Oh, man.

But--


You're way too cute
to be shy.

Oh.

Is that what you're into?
You want me to tie you up?

No. You.

But how am I gonna give you a
massage if my hands are tied?

I don't want a massage.

Okay, well,
I don't do bondage, so...

I guess we're in a bit of
a standoff here, huh?

All right. Get down on the floor.
Hands behind your back.

You don't have to do any of this--
All the way down!

I'll give you
whatever you want.

Shh, shh, shh.

Put your hands
behind your back.

All right.
Give me your hands.

Put them up.



Trisha Leffler
from Las Vegas.

I know where
you live now.

This is an ATM card, right?
Yeah.

What's your PIN?
4321.

What's your PIN?

It's 4321.

Please don't hurt me.

Ohh, no!
Shut up. Shut up.

Don't say a word.
Do you understand?

[muffled voices and music]

All right.

There you go.

There you go.
Before I leave,

I'm gonna take
a little souvenir, okay?

Hmm?
Yeah.

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

It's okay.

[muffled screams]


[elevator dings]

Thank you.
Such a gentleman.


So after he'd cut off
your panties with a knife

to keep as a souvenir?
He took my phone

and deleted the messages
he left for me.

that phone, ma'am?

How'd he get
your number?

He replied to my Craigslist ad,
and I texted him back.

So, then this entirely
anonymous person--

who could've been
anybody-- you, uh,

decided to invite him
up to your room?

I'm usually a better judge.

What were you advertising,
Miss Leffler? Massages.

So, if we check your
record for any priors,

we're not gonna turn up
any, uh, solicitation, prostitution?

Look, I'm not the criminal
here, okay? He is.

And I hope you nail
his preppy ass.

I'm telling you,
what he did to m-

he's done it before,
and he liked it.

Liked what?

I don't know.

Humiliating me.

The one with the Red Sox cap,
just like the lady said.

Calm, attractive,
non-threatening.

A psycho who likes to rough up
defenseless women.

Couldn't ask for
a better cover.

Philip?

Baby?

Hey.

I thought you weren't coming
back till tomorrow.

I needed to see you.
Why, what happened?

What happened, baby?

I didn't get in.

Ohh, sweetie.

I knew it was a long shot,
but I thought...

maybe if I wasn't
in undergrad.

Listen,
they're idiots, okay?

Yeah, but they
accepted you.

You see?
Which proves my point.

It's not funny.

Listen, I'll transfer
wherever you go.

No, J don't want you
to transfer.

I worked really hard,
you know? I really did.

I know.

And now I just
ruined everything.

No, baby, you did not
ruin anything, okay?

Look at me.
You didn't ruin anything.

B.U. was our plan. We were
supposed to be together.

And we will be.

No matter what happens,
we're gonna be fine.

Can we just stay like this
for a little bit?

We can stay like this
for as long as you want.

It's just you and me,
Pocket.

Nothing else matters.

You really got to
go away again?

Final fitting.
No, no final fitting.

I love you.

Love you, too.

Call me when you get there, okay?
Okay, I will.

Okay.
Bye.

Bye.

[starts engine]

"Dear Miss McAllister,
we regret to inform you that--"

Well...

I guess
that decides it.

On to plan B.

Oh, man, you're in.

St. Kitts.
This is fantastic!

It's such a great program.
Look, baby.

But, Mom, that's-- that's
a million miles away.

I can't move a million miles
away from my husband.

Well, if he loves you now,

he's going to love you in five
years after you graduate, right?

Mom...I really don't
want to disappoint you.

Oh, honey,
you could never--

Baby, you'll never
disappoint me.

It's just--

It would be such a waste.

You are so bright
and so compassionate.

You would make
an amazing doctor.

I've thought
about this a lot.

If we can't go to
medical school together,

then I'll just wait.

I can always reapply
later if I want to.

But for now,
this is what I want.

[cell phone ringing]

Hello?
<i>[Megan] Hey, guess where I am.</i>

I'm so glad I got you.
Listen, I was thinking--

what about a beach wedding?

We'd have a beautiful
sunset ceremony.

I was just sleeping.
Can I call you later?

You were? It's the middle
of the afternoon.

<i>I know. I've been</i>
<i>working hard.</i>

Okay, yeah,
I'll call you later. I love you.

<i>Okay.</i>
Bye.

So, what's up?
What did he say?

Did he like
your idea?

Yeah, he loved it.
He was just studying.

But he liked it.
It's gonna be amazing.


[cell phone rings]

Hold on one second,
okay, Mom?

<i>Okay.</i>

I gotta go.

<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

I'm-- I'm fine.

<i>Then why</i>
<i>do you have to go?</i>

Um, I'm going to see
a guy I met on the train.

<i>What guy? Is he cute?</i>
<i>What's he do?</i>

He's a student.
<i>In?</i>

I don't know what in.

<i>You got to know something</i>
<i>about hi, honey.</i>

<i>Where's he from?</i>

I promise I will
get you the whole 411.

<i>Okay, have fun.</i>
<i>I love you, Julissa.</i>

I love you, too.

[elevator dings]

Are you Brian?
Yeah.

You're beautiful.

You're not so bad
yourself.

Ready?
Yeah.

Um...

what do you do here
in Boston, Brian?

I'm, uh,
a grad student.

What do you study?
Sciences.

Oh, that is so cool.

I'm actually doing grad work
myself right now in New York.

Drug and alcohol
counseling, I figure.

Nobody knows the territory like somebody
who's been there themselves, right?

Get down on the ground.
Put your hands behind your back right now.

Uhh!
Aah!

Ow!

Uhh!

Just get on the gr--


Julissa Brisman,
New York City.

Massage table,
no forcible entry.

Sound familiar?

One difference-- CSI said
there was skin under the fingernails.

She fought back,
so he shot her.

He's stepping it up.

Yeah.

Mr. Markoff.

What--


Whoa. I scared you.

Dr. Shaneway...
I'm sorry, sir.

I'm a little jumpy,
I guess.

I've been staying awake
two nights in a row,

memorizing
genetic sequences.

Trying to impress me.

Always, sir.

How's your fiancÃ©e?

Good, great.
I mean, um...

you know,
we've both got school.

[clears throat]
And then there's the wedding.

So, it's a lot.
I bet.

Well, um,
I'd better get going.

But, um...
have a good evening.

You, too, Phillip,
and try to get some rest.

Okay. Yeah, I will.

Hey.
Hey. I'm sorry.

You didn't give me
a kiss when you got in.

I know, I didn't
want to wake you--

Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?

A woman went psychotic
in the ER tonight.

It was crazy.
She went nuts.

She hurt a nurse, so I had
to step in and do something.

My hero.

Come to bed.

We may have just
caught a break.

A friend of Julissa's just called,
got me into her phone.

We have the text she got from the
last guy she had an appointment with.

Digital Forensics
can get an I.P. off that.

We can get an address,
maybe even a name.

That'll take, what, a couple of days?
At least.

[woman sobbing]

How'd he meet her?

Another ad
on Craigslist?

Looks like that.

I don't get.
In this day and age,

girls in a friggin'
hotel room,

a guy she doesn't
even know-- I just--


Mrs. Flores,
Detective Bennett.

Sorry for the loss
of your daughter.

She was a good girl.

I'm sure she was.

She s just getting
her life together.

Who would do this?

Who would do this
to my baby?


Used to be able to tell who
the bad guys were, right?

Now it's all texts
and emails and web sites.

The creeps are hiding
in our houses, and...

we don't even know
who they are.

<i>It is 7:07, and once again,</i>
<i>here's Matt.</i>

<i>All right, Meredith,</i>
<i>thank you.</i>

<i>And now to a story</i>
<i>out of Boston</i>

<i>that's going to</i>
<i>terrify anyone...</i>

Wow, this is in Boston.

What's that?

This guy's right here
in Boston.

<i>...on the popular</i>
<i>web site Craigslist.</i>

<i>Police say he's already</i>
<i>killed one woman...</i>

[cell phone rings]

Hello?
<i>Hey, Megan. It's Mom.</i>

Listen, I was
watching the news,

and I saw this story

about this Boston
hotel killer.

No, we're not
staying in a hotel.

We're here at home,
studying.

<i>Me and Philip</i>
<i>are safe.</i>

Okay.

I love you. Bye.

the profile is never exact,

but a pretty clear
picture is emerging

of what we're
looking for.

We're talking about
a guy with an inability

to form close emotional
relationships with women.

Probably sexual issues.

A loner.

A guy who shies away
from the crowd.

Okay, I guess I could
tell the story of how--

Maybe later.
Come on.

What's up?
Let's go.

You didn't even
give me a chance.

A man with
no sense of status,

of accomplishment.

Let me get this straight.

We're looking
for a big blond loser,

wearing a Red Sox cap
in Boston?

Is that what
you're telling me?

Let's get
right on that one.

We should have that
settled by morning.

Than for the crack work,
Detective.

Maybe somebody
will I.D. the photo.

We got a blurry photo
with the same damn guy

wearing the same friggin' hat.
This is just going great.

<i>[Newscaster]</i>
<i>Police are now hoping</i>
<i>someone out there</i>

<i>recognizes this man from</i>
<i>all the surveillance photos</i>

<i>in the various hotels.</i>

<i>They are trying to get onto</i>
<i>this track this morning,</i>

<i>but so far</i>
<i>they have no leads.</i>

<i>Police say the warning</i>
<i>is out to women now</i>

<i>that this man</i>
<i>is still on the loose...</i>

[knock on door]

<i>especially if you post</i>
<i>ads on Craigslist.</i>

Who is it?

Marcelo, superintendent.

I need to talk to you.

Oh, my God. That's amazing.

Nice.

[cell phone beeps]

All right,
that's it for me.

I'm cashing out.
I'm done.

I'm sorry, I gotta go.

I've got another date,
ladies. I'm so sorry.

$5,300.

[cell phone vibrating]

<i>[Automated voice]</i>
<i>You have three new messages.</i>

<i>[Megan] Hey, Philip. I need to</i>
<i>talk to you. Where are you?</i>

<i>Message deleted.</i>

<i>[Megan] Philip, call me.</i>
<i>I need to talk to you, okay?</i>

<i>Message deleted.</i>

<i>[Megan] Baby, where are you?</i>
<i>Call me as soon as--</i>

No, no.
<i>Message deleted.</i>


Hey, your client
there yet?

He called and said he'd
be late ten minutes.

All right, well,
text me when he gets there.

Promise. Love you,
sweetheart.

I love you, too, babe.

You're a young one.
Come on in.

It's just a lap dance,
like the ad said, okay??

That's all I came for,
yeah.

Lie face-down
on the floor.

Lie face-down
on the floor right now!

Put your hands
behind your back.

Listen to me--I do not
want to kill you, okay?

[cell phone rings]

Who's calling your phone?
I don't know.

Honey, take a seat.
Don't move, don't move.

Get off! Get off!


What the hell's
going on here?


[door opens]

<i>[Newscaster speaking</i>
<i>on television]</i>

[breathing heavily]

<i>The hunt for the man being called</i>
<i>the "Craigslist Killer"</i>

<i>has spread this morning</i>
<i>from Boston to Rhode Island.</i>

<i>Police in Warwick, near</i>
<i>Providence, are investigating</i>

<i>a robbery attempt that may</i>
<i>involve the same man</i>

<i>who killed two young</i>
<i>women in Boston.</i>

<i>Boston police say the</i>
<i>murderer apparently targeted--</i>

I thought you said
no secrets.

What are you
talking about?

Where have you been?

What do you mean?

The super came by.

You haven't paid the rent
in three months.

If there's something going on,
then I need to know before--

Before what?
Before you marry me?

I missed some bills, Meg.

I'm sorry, okay?
I'm studying 20 hours a day.

I've got millions of tons of
crap that I'm dealing with,

and professors on top of that.
But you know what?

You're right, you're right.
I screwed up.

I screwed up, and I'm--
You know what?

I'm sorry that I'm not the
perfect guy you thought I was.

I never asked you
to be the perfect guy.

Then what are you
asking me?

What do you want
from me, Meg?

I should've
told you first, okay?

And-- And I didn't.
I just--

I get in my own head
about things, and--


It's been a really hard
time for me, you know?

It's been a hard time
for me, too.

I know, I know.

Look, I am--
I'm sorry, babe.

I am so sorry, okay?

I haven't been there for you,
and I'm gonna be there, all right?

Baby, look at me.
It's my fault, okay?

But I am trying my best.

I'll go down to the management
office tomorrow.

I'll take care of it,
right away, first thing.

I promise, okay?

God, I love you.

I don't want to mess this up, babe.
I don't want to lose you.

I'm not going anywhere.

You promise?
Yes.

Good.

Just...you need to
let me in, okay?


I have no idea what I did
to deserve you.

The lady got lucky.

Husband was in the lobby,
came to check on her.

Hey, blow that up for me,
would you?

Uh, Lieutenant?

We tracked an I.P. address

for that last email
to Julissa.

Whoever sent it
lives in Quincy.

He who kills
by the internet

fries by the internet,
right?

He's not frying yet.
It's an apartment complex,

so the killer could've been using
someone else's wireless signal.

Then I want a full
tenant list for that building.

I want six units down there,
six invisible units.

And I want 100 copies
of this picture blown up.

Let's hope the coffee's
good down in Quincy.

Listen to me, listen to me.

I don't want you hanging out
in the mall on a school night.

You understand?

Okay, all right.
You got a ride?

Do I know him?

Okay. All right.

Great, I love you, baby.
I'll see you back at the house.

This guy
is driving me crazy.

I mean, he's turning me
into my old man here.

I'm two seconds away from locking
my daughter up for good.

Gotta let her go
at some point.

Do I?

There's got to be
800 units in this place.

Great. All we've got to do now
is wait for a guy to waltz by

who looks like
a vicious loner killer

with emotional issues.

You're kidding me,
right?

This guy
could be anybody.

You got another picture
I can look at? Anything?

If you see anyone,
just give me a call.

[elevator dings]

Good luck with that,
Officer.

Hey.

Before we go...
What?

What are we having
for dinner tonight?

Making something good?
I don't know yet.

You don't have
to cook tonight.

No, I want to.

Okay. Laundry time
first, though.

I.P. came up with a name.

Son of a bitch.

Philip Markoff,
residing in Quincy, Mass.

Are you kidding me?

I mean, come on, you put
a baseball cap on that freak,

we've definitely
got our guy.

He's a med student
at B.U.

478 friends.

Who the hell would want
478 friends?

"Religious views--
it's complicated."

"Relationship status--
engaged."

Quite a catch,
this fella, huh?

We can always bring him in,
question him.

No, no, no, no.

We stop by, he's not there,
he hears we showed up--

he's off to Brazil.

I don't want to spook him.

We just sit tight,
keep him under surveillance,

get a positive I.D.
from the masseuse,

and boom-- nail him.

<i>[Newscaster] And the hunt</i>
<i>for the so-called</i>
<i>"Craigslist Killer"</i>

<i>is intensifying, with police</i>
<i>hoping to catch him</i>

<i>before he strikes again.</i>

<i>NBC's Jeff Rossen has</i>
<i>the latest now from Boston.</i>

See?
This is way better.

<i>Amy, police are literally</i>
<i>going hotel to hotel now</i>

<i>here in the Boston area...</i>

Wow, this is him?

That could be anybody.

<i>They're worried he's</i>
<i>planning his next attack.</i>

I'll be right back.

Are you all right?
Yeah.

<i>Over the weekend,</i>
<i>investigators pored through--</i>

<i>If you're still mad,</i>
<i>I'd just rather</i>

<i>we called</i>
<i>the whole thing off.</i>

<i>[Donna Reed]</i>
<i>You certainly have an in...</i>

[breathing heavily]

[echoing voices]

<i>[Deborah Kerr on TV]</i>
<i>Until I met you--</i>

Hey, you know what?
<i>...was possible, either.</i>

Let's get out of here.
What?

I don't know.
Let's go somewhere, yeah?

You and me, right now.
I'm getting cabin fever.

Those crazy stories on the news,
and we've been studying so much--

I know, but I have an exam.
If I want to reapply to med school,

I can't fail my senior year.

Okay, then we'll just--
let's bring your books.

We can bring your books,
and you can study, you know?

We can check into a hotel,
get some room service.

We can order some movies,
we can do some other things.


Yeah?

We should go to Foxwoods.
Oh.

No, we should go to Foxwoods.
It'll be like a pre-honeymoon.

I don't know if it's a good
idea to be gambling right now.

No, no, we're not gambling.
There's a spa.

We can go to the spa and
get away from all this noise.

Really?

Doctor's orders.

Okay.

Yeah?

Here we go.

Who are you,
pretty lady?

Next victim?

No, no, no.
Not his M.O.

What's with
the suitcases?

Skipping town?

Get a picture.
I don't want to make our move

until we get a positive I.D.
from Trisha Leffler.

[camera clicking]

Seems a little jumpy.

If I had a pretty girl
hanging on my arm,

I'd be a hell of a lot
happier than he is.

Maybe nice girls
aren't his type.

Hang in there, sweetheart.
We're not gonna let you out of our sight.

[starts engine]

Looks like they're
heading out of the city.

Detective Frye, requesting
State Trooper assistance.

Pursuing suspect south
on Congress Street.

Champagne-colored SUV.

Where the hell
are you two going?

Babe. Babe...
would you let me?

What? We're just--

Hey, let's speed up.

You want to go?
Let's get there fast. Why not?

Uh, maybe not?

You're the thrill-seeker
of the family, remember?

I'm just the sweet
little girl from Jersey.

Fine.

They're making a move.

Heading for the 95.

This could be
the positive I.D.

All right, this is it.
Call it.

We're taking him down.

[siren blaring]

What?

Why are they pulling us over?
I wasn't even speeding.

Get out of the car. Out of the car!
What is happening?

Let's go, now, move it.
Hands on the dash!

Engine off.
Get out of the car.

Take her, take her.
What is going on?

Get out of the car.
Keep your hands up.

What did I do?
What did--

Why are you
doing this? Wait.

What's going on?

Philip Markoff,
you're under arrest

for the murder of Julissa Brisman.

On the ground.
That's crazy! What--

Philip, tell them that
they have the wrong person!

We're gonna take you
back to Boston

and ask you
some questions.

Up. You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

What is going on?
You have the right to an attorney.

If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed by the court.

Do you understand these rights
as they've been read to you?

Yes.

Bag.

This guy keeps an awful lot
of books under his bed, huh?

I used to do the same
thing in college.

It's cheaper than
buying shelves.

This, on the other hand,

I did not have
under my bed at school.

Whoa.

We got him.

Bingo.

9 millimeter. Bag!

Grab the other side.
We're gonna lift it.

Look at that.

Tell me you never hid your socks
under your mattress, huh?

Trophy.

How many you got there?

13, 14, 15, 16.

16.

Only three reported.

Obviously the others didn't
want their mothers to know

what they do
for a living, right?

With all due respect,
Detectives,

you're embarrassing
yourselves.

All right?
What have you got?

You got a superficial
resemblance to what?

An out-of-focus
surveillance video?

Well, we got flex cuffs,
16 pairs of women's panties,

and a 9 millimeter.

All right, well,
you've got some party favors,

and you've got
some unwashed laundry,

and, yeah, I bought a gun
to protect my fiancÃ©e.

I mean, we live in
a sketchy neighborhood, sir.
Is that right?

We spoke to the owner of the
gun shop up in New Hampshire.

He says he, uh, sold the gun
to a Brian Stevens.

Whose I.D. happened to be
in your top drawer.

You want to explain to us
why you purchased a weapon

with somebody else's I.D.?

Sir, I'm a straight-A
medical student.

I'm-- I'm getting married
in a month.

I mean, would you guys
care to explain to me

why I would go around and--

and shoot prostitutes
in hotel rooms?

What, you still don't
believe me?

Ask around.

how wrong you are about Philip.

Do you know where he was between
9:00 and 11:00 pm on April 14?

He's dedicated
his whole life

to becoming a doctor
and helping people.

So, you don't know where he was
between 9:00 and 11:00 on April 14?

He's a medical
student, okay?

He spends thousands of hours
at the library and the lab,

and I'm sure there's people
there that have seen him.

We'll be sure
to check that out.

There's nothing
to check out.

This is a huge
mistake, okay?

Philip is not a killer.

Did you know that
we found handcuffs,

a 9 millimeter pistol,
and 16 pairs of women's panties

stuffed under
your mattress?

Did you know that?

I'm marrying Philip
on August 14.

You don't think I know
my own fiancÃ©?

You don't think
that I would've known

if there was a gun
under my own--

I don't know what
you know, Miss McAllister.

Look, am I under arrest or something?
No.

In fact,
you're free to go.

But you can't go back
to your apartment.

And your car's been
impounded as evidence.

If I'm free to go,
then I'm going.

Are you telling me that
one of our top students

is the Craigslist
Killer?

No, no, we're just
investigating at this point,

checking out his story.

So, you're saying
he was actually here,

you know, studying,
being a student?

I'm saying he was
actually here

being a star in all
of his classes.

Look, Lieutenant,
I don't know if you know

just how hard it is to
be a medical student.

It's not
physically possible

for someone to do
as brilliantly

as Philip has done

in one of the most competitive
programs in the country,

and then run off to Rhode Island
and commit these crimes.

Not physically possible.

[buzzer sounds]

[inmates shouting]

[buzzer sounds]

[inmates shouting]

people get here?

How did they know?

How could you not know?

Dad, what--

Do not talk to them.

I want you to go
inside right away.

[reporters chattering]

Megan! Megan!

private property.

You must step off
of my property. Now.

[inmates shouting]

Seven! Seven! Seven!

[buzzer sounds]




even let me call him.

I mean, he's in there
all alone, and I can't even--

I can't talk to him.
I can't do anything. I'm so sorry.

When this is all over,
I'm going to make sure

that he demands
an apology,

because a doctor cannot
have an accusation like this

hanging over his head.
This is ridiculous.

Look, we don't even really
know what happened.

Of course we do.
They arrested the wrong guy.

That's what happened.

I'm just saying,
there's a lot of the story

that we still don't know.

Oh, my God. You guys are
just like everybody else.

You really think
that he's a killer?

You think that
he's a killer,

and I've been living
with him this whole time?

And I didn't know?
No, no.

That I'm that stupid?

I mean, Mom, come on.
If someone came to the door

and told you that Dad is a killer,
would you believe him?

Oh, my God.

Sweetie, we just feel--

Unfortunately,
you are here today

because you were given
the wrong information,

as was the public.

Philip Markoff
is a beautiful person

inside and out,
and couldn't hurt a fly.

A police officer in Boston,
or several,

is trying to make big bucks
by selling a false story

to the TV stations.
What else is new?

<i>Philip is an intelligent man</i>

<i>who is just trying</i>
<i>to live his life.</i>

<i>So, if you could leave us alone,</i>
<i>we would appreciate it.</i>

<i>We expect to marry</i>
<i>in August</i>

<i>and share a wonderful</i>
<i>and meaningful life together.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

Our boy sure picked
the right girl.

<i>[Man] I've known</i>
<i>Phil Markoff since sophomore year.</i>

<i>I can't even</i>
<i>put into words</i>

<i>the disbelief I'm</i>
<i>feeling right now.</i>

<i>He was a great guy.</i>

<i>He wasn't someone</i>
<i>who'd ever even own a gun.</i>

<i>[Reporter] As Markoff</i>
<i>is without resources,</i>

<i>it's the taxpayers</i>
<i>of Massachusetts</i>

<i>who'll be footing the bill</i>
<i>for his defense.</i>

<i>Doing the honors will be well-known</i>
<i>public defender Robert Grossman.</i>

A public defender?
That's insane!

His parents aren't even
paying for a lawyer?

Dad, do you know somebody?
We have to help him.

<i>Although Markoff is being</i>
<i>kept away from the media,</i>

<i>his attorney continues</i>
<i>to publicly profess his client's inno--</i>

We got him.
He's got a public defender.

Is that right?

2005--a guy gets his underage
girlfriend pregnant.

Tried to dodge statutory rape.
He and his buddy

kill her with a knife and a brick,
and toss her in the gutter.

Cops have fingerprints, DNA,
confessions from both.

The buddy gets 20 years.

Ken Braniff gets
Grossman as a lawyer--

goes free.

He's walking the streets
of Boston today.

That's not true.
Is that true?

Heh. Robert Grossman
can make an alibi

out of two sticks
and a ball of twine.

Then we need to make
a preemptive strike

on Markoff's alibis.

Was that the door?
I don't know.

No reporters on the property.
I'm gonna call the police.

They are
the police.

How are you, Megan?
Good to see you again.
Fine.

Detective Bennett,
Boston P.D.

She was lucky. She got out with
only two busted ribs.

He hit her so hard in the face,
she's still having trouble seeing.

Look, you guys have
the wrong guy, okay?

Philip isn't capable of killing anybody.
Are you sure?

Everybody knows that
the Boston Police Department

is the worst
in the country.

This isn't about
the Boston P.D.

We're trying to figure out who
murdered an innocent young woman.

We have a positive I.D.
from a woman he beat up

and robbed in Rhode Island.


I believe in Philip,
Lieutenant.

Did you know your boyfriend posted
on a sexual fetish web site

under the username
"SexAddict53885"?

We took it right off
his hard drive.

You--You guys could've
put that on there.

Digital forensics can prove
that Philip made these postings

long before he killed Julissa
Brisman with a 9 millimeter.

Her skull fragments
were found

embedded in the wall
in the hotel room.

She died choking
on her own blood.

SexAddict53885 was into--
and I quote--

"submission
and humiliation".

All right, I'd like you
to stop this now--

Whoa, whoa.
Also on his list...

was "friendship
and experimentation

with transvestites
and transsexuals."

I said that's enough!

That's not Philip.

He's got a description
of himself here.

"Born February 12,
1986.

"6'4",
blond, athletic.

Eight inches, cut."

That's enough!
You're out of here.

Does that
physical description

match your absolute
knowledge of your fiancÃ©?

Detective, stop this now.
Get out of here.

Is that your perfect fiancÃ©?
Don't put that--

Get them out of here!

You've done enough!
You stop this now.

Megan!

You want to bully people?
Get out of my house.

Leave our home now.


[buzzer sounds]

to do this to Megan?

I thought you loved her.

I didn't do it.

You can spare everybody
a lot of pain.

You want her
to see you like this?

How ugly you are?

I didn't do it.

It's going to be
a circus, Phil.

There's going
to be pictures.

The media, they're going
to turn you into a monster.

Phil...

talk to me, all right?

I mean, I don't--
I don't get it.

You had everything--

a beautiful girl
who loved you,

a bright future.

If you'd played your cards right,
years from now,

you'd be a rich doctor,
having dinner parties

on the Vineyard
with your wife and kids.

Right?

You'd be living the dream.

Instead of...
rotting in here.

Help me out, Phil.

I need it to make sense--
for me.

Why would you do this?

Why would you hurt
those people?

Why would you
throw it all away?

<i>We've been talking</i>
<i>about Philip Markoff</i>

<i>and allegations about other</i>
<i>killers leading double lives,</i>

<i>and frequently</i>
<i>the women who love them,</i>

<i>or at least who always seem</i>
<i>surprised when the cops--</i>

That is not going
to make you feel better.

It won't?
No.

in my head, and--

You know,
what didn't I see?

He was--
He was a med student.

He worked late.

He was on his computer
late at night.

How is that different from
any other guy at B.U.?

It's not.
So...

how was I supposed
to make that leap?

Megs...he fooled
everybody, okay?

He seemed like
the perfect guy.

Maybe I just wanted
him to be perfect so bad that...

I only saw
what I wanted to see.

I loved him so much.

It's all right.

He made me feel like
no one every made me feel.

Come here.

I'm right here.

Number four.

Did you get my suit
back from the tailor?

He was going to fix the--

the button thing
in my cuff.

Philip, stop.

The wedding's only
a couple of weeks away now.

Stop it!

I came here today
because...

I need you to look me
in my eyes

and tell me the truth.

Can you do that, Philip?

Please?

I love you.
I always will.

Please, just tell me.

Please?

Maybe--

Maybe--

the person who
did this, maybe...

they didn't feel
like they deserved

all that they had.

Maybe they didn't feel
like they deserved

someone as amazing
as you.

You're amazing.

I love you.

Maybe...

they felt like
all they deserved

was to be punished.

I saw a picture
of the gun.

And the underwear that you
put under the mattress.

<i>Our </i> mattress.

How many girls
were there?

16? Did you--

Were you safe?
Do I need to get tested?

I mean, getting tested
is a smart policy for anybody.

Please don't do that.

It said on your site
that--

that you were into
bondage and...

cross-dressing.
Did you do that stuff?

Megan, sweetheart,
you can't...

believe everything you see
on the internet, you know?

This whole time.

You've been lying to me
this whole time?

You've been looking in
my eyes and lying to me?

I mean, what did I do?

What did I do
to deserve this?

What--
What did I do?

I'm done here!

No, no. Megan, baby.
Baby, baby--

Baby! Baby, baby,
please come back! Please!

I'm scared! I'm scared
to death in here. Please don't.

Please. Please don't--

Please.

I'm never going
to see you again.

I love you, Pocket.

<i>[Newscaster] We'll begin</i>
<i>with these new details</i>

<i>in the death of</i>
<i>Philip Markoff--</i>

<i>the accused</i>
<i>Craigslist Killer.</i>

<i>NBC's Jeff Rossen</i>
<i>is in Boston.</i>

<i>Jeff, good morning to you.</i>

<i>Hi, Meredith,</i>
<i>good morning to you.</i>

<i>This morning we're getting</i>
<i>our first look inside Markoff's cell.</i>

<i>And just to paint</i>
<i>a picture for you here,</i>

<i>police say he had photos</i>
<i>of his ex-fiancÃ©e</i>

<i>spread out all over,</i>
<i>it appears.</i>

<i>According to investigators,</i>

<i>this was the last thing</i>
<i>he was looking at</i>

<i>before he committed suicide.</i>

<i>After he stabbed himself,</i>

<i>he wrote messages to her</i>

<i>on the wall in blood</i>

<i>in a spot where he could</i>
<i>see it but she couldn't.</i>

<i>It was her name, and then</i>
<i>he wrote something else,</i>

<i>which they believe may be</i>
<i>a secret message.</i>

<i>â™ª No, no, no â™ª</i>

[Megan laughs]

And, um...

a big oak tree
in the front yard.

It's got to be big enough to
build a tree house in, though.

Yes, for our three kids.

No, four. Four kids.

Four kids? Watch out.
That's four college educations--

two med school,
two law school.
Okay.

Yes, but,
lest we forget,

their dad is
the head of surgery

at an internationally
renowned teaching hospital.

And Mom just had
a huge breakthrough

in cancer research.

Okay, so, make it five kids.
Okay.

Four boys in a row,

and then after,
a girl--

so she'll be
really protected.

Well, if she looks
anything like her mother,

she is going to be.

I'm crazy about you,
Megan McAllister.

<i>â™ª Stay forever and ever â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And ever, amen â™ª</i>
