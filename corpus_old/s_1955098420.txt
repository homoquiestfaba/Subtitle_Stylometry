"So, you want to make it
on the TV talk shows?

"You want to be
the toast of The Tonight Show...

"the delight of David Letterman,
the apple of Arsenio's eye?

"Style is what it takes.

"Style in abundance. That's you, baby.

"When you come on...

"'Make sure you hug the A-Man,'
says Christian Slater..."

Damn mosquito. "...Arsenio intimate.

"Dweezil Zappa
suggests a nod to the posse.

'"It lets the musicians know
you're one of them...

"'and suggests to the home audience
that you're part of the family."'

Jesus, Biff. What are you doing?
You want someone to see?

What do you say, Biff?
You'll kick ass in this getup.

Dr. Napalm. Man, this is some kind of good.

The camera will love and caress you
in this outfit.

And it's got its own built-in wad
for the female demographic.

This is what myself and your other assistant
will be wearing.

It's state of the art.
It'll take something like 1,100 degrees.

These things retail for $6,000 apiece,
but this guy's gonna let me trade...

the Tilt-A-Whirl
and the Flying Bobs for them.

Good deal. What do you think?

Wait. Just one second.

Biff never said
who his assistants were gonna be.

What makes you think
one of them is gonna be you?

'Cause this here suit fits me like a glove.

Not to mention the fact
that I just committed a major felony...

and risked my job by trading off
two carnival attractions that I don't own.

So why the hell shouldn't I be his assistant?

I mean, right, Biff?

Don't, Biff.

<i>Attention, patrons.</i>

<i>Midlothian Shopping Center
is now closed for the evening.</i>

<i>We'll be back tomorrow at 9:00.</i>

<i>See you then. And God bless.</i>

I think I got all the ticks out of them.
You do?

Let's make it up on the roof.
No.

I told you, we're not doing it on the roof.

Kitchen table?
There's not enough room.

We could put the leaf in.

Okay.

Where's the leaf?

I don't know. You had it last.
Is it under the trailer?

I wouldn't put it under the trailer.
It would dry-rot under the trailer.

Vida, we have a bed.
Let's use it like normal people.

Wilder, three more days in this place.

Three more days and I'm free.
I can go anywhere I want.

Go to the city, see some dinner theater,
hear the symphony.

No. Don't mess with it.

Please? I really want to.

I really do.

Okay.

Are you gonna look
in the closet for the leaf?

Forget the table. I'm nostalgic for a bed.

Well, that was a good idea.

You got a little sixteenth note left on you.

Vida, I have to go to work.

Kierkegaard, 17 across.

Thanks.

Last night, I dreamt we were Elvis
and Ann-Margret in <i>Viva</i> Las Vegas.

Again?

Only this time you were booked
in this sort of hotel-casino type thing.

It was sort of hot and dimly lit.

It reminded me of No <i>Exit</i> by Sartre.
And we were like prisoners.

We were held captive
unless and until you would sing.

And you were Elvis,
so it wasn't like you couldn't sing.

But you wouldn't do it.

So I was standing there saying:

"Come on, King. Just sing a song already."

And you were saying, "No, thanks, ma'am.

"I think I'll just stick
with this valet-parking thing."

You think that means something?

Light my cigarette.

No matches, baby.

All right, take it out of your mouth.

No. Live dangerously, Wilder.
I know you can do it.

Come on.

Smoking is bad for you.

Oh, God, Wilder.
So is 362 days of house arrest.

If you just came out with this thing,
we could be rich.

You'd be an emperor.
You could be Gruppenfiihrer.

They would make you a Mayan sun god.

It's just a damn parlor trick.

That's all it's good for.
So you keep saying.

God damn!

If I called you up in the middle of the day...

and asked you to drop everything
and come home, would you do it?

Not if the house
was burning to the ground, Vida.

<i>Brass nozzles</i>

<i>secret fire trucks</i>

<i>hydrants, canvas hose</i>

<i>and safety nets</i>

Come on, boy! Why don't you come on?

Ain't got all day!

Come on! Let's get this thing in the air!

You hear me? Come on! Chop-chop!

You're not getting paid to pick your butt!
Now get over here!

We're doing this one first, all right?

Shit!

So, where's the fire?

Your house. Again!

What can I tell you?

I was up on the roof exercising,
and as near as I can figure...

my empty drinking glass must've focused...

the sun's rays in such a fashion
as to ignite the dry grass.

Twice in six months.
I know.

Vida, you have bad luck with fire,
don't you?

Yes. And that's why it's so lucky
that I'm married to a fireman.

Don't you think?
Yes, Vida.

But I tell you,
this is mighty suspicious-looking.

And seeing as how
you're under house arrest for arson...

and seeing as how
you got only three days left--

No, two days. Don't count today.

Two days. I'd be real careful if I was you.

I'd be a regular Smokey the Bear.

Yes, sir, she will be.

What the hell was this about?

It was an accident.
It was a boredom-induced accident.

You just better watch your step.

Bring home the boots and helmet tonight.

You guys haven't seen each other
in five years?

Not since he married her.

Don't make it six. We're here.

Honey, just go say hi.
Tell him about being on the TV.

Just try it.

Stay.
Come on! Cindy!

Hark!

Burn him, Biff.

Not when I'm in makeup. In makeup, I'm Biff.

Badass Biff. Burn him, Biff.

He's my brother, Rex.

They know what you can do?
Sure do.

Why, we're just one
big old thermonuclear family, Wilder!

That's right.
Sure are.

Christ, Wallace. You're a clown.

Good job.

You, too, Wilder.

Photo-booth jockey.

Very impressive.

Kind of like the Marlboro Man or something.

And nice rug, Wilder.

Good look for you.

Real hair never grew back?

I'm real sorry about that.

Go drop your pants and chase a doughnut,
you and your single-helix friends.

Fellas, what did I say wrong?
He's gone all ballistic on me.

How's Vida?
Still with me.

Hell, I knew that.

Coming into town today...

we saw y'all's love burnt across the clouds.

Real meteorological phenomenon.

You and sweet Vida
still living in that trailer park?

Homey.

Why, I think that's just the perfect place
to just plop down...

and start grinding out rug rats.

Just be domestic.

Buy some spinning daisy reflectors
for the yard.

Let those beautiful,
dirty-faced little children...

just run around the neighborhood
with no pants on.

"A fate worse than death,"
proclaims my brother...

the clown.

This guy's been blowing our fuses
with his air conditioner, Biff.

This air conditioner?

Don't do it.
Is this the machine to which you refer?

I said--

This beautiful,
climate-controlled, frost-free...

tundra wonder?

Just like five years ago.

Hell, just like our whole damn lives, Wilder.

You ain't changed a bit.

Hey, baby. How was your day?

There he is. There's my man.
No small appliance is safe tonight.

Did you see that air conditioner go?
Looked like damn uranium or something.

I'm keeping a chunk of it for a paperweight.

You ought to do that on TV.

You got all the joints
cotter-pinned this time, Rex?

We might've left a box of them
back at Frostproof, I think.

You got a quarter?
Yeah.

I'll keep an eye out for falling kids, Biff.

My name is Wallace, Rex.

Couldn't we maybe just have dinner first?
No. You'd just get cramps.

Hello?

<i>Who is this?</i>

<i>Hydrant wrenches</i>

<i>and shiny brass nozzles</i>

<i>Maglites and doorstops</i>

<i>bingo</i>

Don't go in there!
That's my private clubhouse.

This here is my private clubhouse.
I'm just letting you see the outside.

Okay? You can't go in.

Looks like an outhouse to me.

Yeah, Horace. We don't even want to go in.

Besides, it's on fire.

What's happening?

Heads up!

<i>Unit 27, is that you?</i>

So, what are you looking at?

So, what are you looking at?

You taught me how to do this.
Yes, I did.

About a year and a half ago--
Right.

A year and a half ago,
Wilder was managing this medical pavilion.

It was a pretty good job, <i>too.</i>
I mean, good benefits, nice people.

For him, it was a great job and he knew it.

And everybody really liked him.

It was winter at the time,
and he'd have to wake up...

really early on snowy days
to go out and shovel all the sidewalks.

And I was always getting on his case,
you know, about using his stuff...

to clear the sidewalks.

'Cause it would only take a minute
to melt all that snow...

and it was 5:00 a.m.,
so no one was gonna see or anything.

That way, I figured
if he used a little bit of that voodoo...

he could rush right back home and see me.

But anyway, he wouldn't go for it.

It was a Saturday,
so I was off work and I was helping him.

It was really icy.

And he's out front shoveling away
like crazy, and I'm in the back.

And I remember standing there,
holding this snow shovel...

looking at these two sidewalks
covered with about an inch of solid ice.

I mean, no way.

So, I go over to the tool shed...

I get a big can of gasoline...

and very neatly, I pour it down the lengths
of these two sidewalks.

I strike a match,
and I light up the first sidewalk.

And I'm telling you, it worked great.

I mean, gas doesn't mix with water,
it just burns on the top and melts all the ice.

Then I sort of notice
that the fire's starting to move.

All that ice had turned to water.

And the sidewalks were on an incline...

so all this flaming water
is now moving slowly downhill...

onto the steps of this doctor's office.

To make matters worse...

on the door of this doctor's office
is a pet flap.

Only, it's not a pet flap.

It's a little drop-off door...

where they drop off
stool and urine samples.

But all I know is this flaming water...

is pouring through the stool-sample door
of this doctor's office.

$18,000 in damages.

Wilder lost his job.

He never yelled at me though.

That's when
the Department of Corrections...

gave me this two-pound fashion statement
to wear.

But it comes off tomorrow.
Comes off tomorrow.

Which one of you sent me
the wedding photo?

Wilder sent you our wedding picture?
Yeah, it figures.

He would twist the knife.

There's no knife.
Why wasn't I told about your house arrest?

The same reason
he didn't say you rolled into town.

-It's Wilder.
Wilder's a schmuck.

I don't know why he hates me.
Why does he hate me?

Why don't you start with burning off his hair
at his bachelor party?

He told you that?
Yeah.

He could have fought back.
Oh, God!

Light me.

What?

Light my cigarette.
No, I can't do that.

Not without burning your face off.

Not while I'm looking at you.

You know, when I think about you--
Yeah, well, Wilder can do it.

<i>I'm gonna go on The David Letterman Show.</i>

I know someone
who's the head of booking for the show...

and I'm gonna go on.

I'm gonna burn some stuff on the air,
parlay some publicity...

maybe get myself a movie deal
or my own TV show.

And commercials?
A lot of money in commercials.

I can sell lighter fluid, radar ranges,
flame-broiled Whoppers.

You know, being able to burn stuff
with your mind is a God-given talent.

Just like being able
to slam-dunk a basketball.

The American public will eat it up.
I love being able to do it.

It's a damn shame
to waste a God-given talent all your life.

I don't disagree.

You see, I knew you'd say that.

I told you five years ago
you married the wrong guy.

<i>Mon frÃ©re!</i>

Hey, honey.

Did you bring the men home
for some lemonade?

Yeah.

Catch me, men.

Heads up.

I'm all over!

I think she's put on a couple of pounds.

<i>Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl</i>

<i>As I walk through this world</i>

<i>Nothing can stop the Duke of Earl</i>

<i>And you, you are my girl</i>

<i>No one can hurt you, oh no</i>

<i>Yes, I'm</i>

<i>Nothing can stop me now</i>

<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Ear!</i>

<i>And when I hold you</i>

<i>You'll be my Duchess</i>

<i>my Duchess of Earl</i>

<i>And we'll walk through my dukedom</i>

<i>And a paradise we will share</i>

<i>Yes</i>

<i>I'm gonna love you</i>

<i>Come on let me hold you darlin'</i>

<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Ear!</i>

<i>Yes, I'm</i>

<i>Come on let me hold you darlin'</i>

<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Ear!</i>

That's the same car you had five years ago.

<i>Mon frÃ©re?</i>

That's the same car you had five years ago.

Yeah.

What's wrong with it?

It's the...

I don't know.

At least you got it up on blocks.

That's a real hip white-trash aesthetic.

Neighbors must be real jealous
you thought of it first.

Seems this car's an analogy to your life.
It ain't going nowhere neither.

Now, that's deep.

Bozo, is it?

Look, why are you here?

Why aren't you over
comparing herpes sores...

with that Algonquian roundtable
of shitheads you run with?

Why are you back in town?

Why are you sitting on my front porch
drinking out of my glass?

What makes you think you're welcome?

I came here to tell you that I'm going public.

<i>I'm gonna flame some stuff
on The David Letterman Show.</i>

What?

Are you insane?
Yeah! See, I knew you'd say that!

What's wrong with that idea?

Well, for starters, you'd be a freak.

Guys in wingtip shoes
would shove a probe up your ass...

stick you out on an Indian reservation
in the middle of the Mojave Desert...

and read you like a petri dish.

You read Fine-starter, didn't you?

They'll try to link you
to every fire going up the East Coast...

back to Horace Braintree's clubhouse.

Here we go
with Horace Braintree's clubhouse!

We were little kids! Nobody cares anymore!

Not even Horace freaking Braintree,
who last time I heard...

has an ex-cheerleader wife,
his own Buick dealership...

and a bunch of chubby little kids...

he takes off to karate class every Saturday!

Anyway, I'm doing it!

I'm going on Letterman!

I don't believe any
of your paranoid bullshit anymore!

And I figure I'd like to try being rich
for a change.

So I'll just see you in the funny papers.

I'll see you later, Vida.

<i>They're gonna put me in the movies</i>

<i>they're gonna make a big star out of me</i>

<i>They're gonna put me in the movies</i>

<i>and all I gotta do ls act</i>

Did you hear the one about the carny
who committed oral sex on a chicken?

Well, he...

Take me up to the top.

What you figure? That brother of his?

All I know is...

I'm gonna get off the road and on TV...

or I'm gonna goddamn kill somebody.

I'm ready!

God, I'm sorry, Lloyd! I'm sorry!

It's just a little blood.
You'll come in, you'll be fine.

I'm free!

My debt to society is paid in full.

It's 12:47 and 23 seconds.

Time to screw. Let's do it in the booth.

You're not serious.
Yes, I really am.

Let's just find some hedges or something.

Baby, I'm raring to go!

I know you are, honey, but...
What?

No?

All right.

Let's go for a walk.
It's been a year since I went for a walk.

Come on. Out of that shoebox.

I'm waiting for a surprise visit
from my supervisor.

Don't want to lose my job.

So?

All right. What are we gonna
do tonight then?

Well, you know.

I'm calling bingo for the Women's Auxiliary.

It'll be great.

Maybe you'll come with me,
win us some money.

Bingo?

Wilder, no.

No symphony?

No dinner theater? Bingo?

I was supposed to call bingo last week
and I didn't go.

I mean, how many times have I missed...

because you didn't want me to leave?

And now tonight
you don't have to stay home.

Besides, the car isn't running.
You can't walk to a symphony.

What are you thinking?
Nothing.

I just had a quick flash
about the rest of my life, that's all.

I'll see you later, honey.

Sorry.

Hi, Dick. Hi, Nick.
Hi, Vida.

Who are you?

You found my dog!

Yeah, or vice versa.

Or vice versa.

So are you gonna explain the tie
or do I just have to guess?

Oh, it's no big deal.

I just happened to fall into two tickets
to this chamber-music thing...

they're doing downtown this afternoon.

You're a real shit, Wallace.

Yes, I am.

Come on! Ride up front with me!

Nope! I can't be inside today.

I do love Beethoven.

Mozart.

I love Beethoven.

Where to now?

I appreciate it,
but Wilder's gonna be mad as it is.

I better get home.

I'm sorry. Did you say
you wanted to see some fireworks?

Thirty-two years is an awfully long time
to keep a secret.

So, what was it that made you decide
to go public?

<i>8-12,.</i>

Good thing I didn't aim.

So, anyway you were saying...
Was I?

Don't laugh.
Don't say anything funny.

I mean, it's not much of a story, really.

The carnival was in Frostproof, Florida...

we weren't doing much business.

It was raining...

and I was watching Bewitched
on a bootleg cable box.

Now, on Bewitched,
what does Darrin always say?

"Sam, honey, don't use your magic powers
to make us rich or happy...

"or to improve our sex lives.

"In fact, don't use them at all,
it would be wrong."

And I realized that I'm watching this
on a crappy foam mattress...

I'm eating cereal straight out of the box...

and I'm alone.

And that's when it finally hit me.

Wrong? What's so wrong about it?

And the more I watched...

the more I realized
that Darrin reminded me of somebody...

and that somebody was Wilder...

and Sam reminded me of me.

That I wasn't living up to my full potential.

And then Bewitched ended
and <i>I</i> Dream of Jeannie came on...

and I figured it was some kind of a sign.

So here I am.

<i>6-47,.</i>

What are you doing?

I'm helping you with your shot.

Who are you, Andy Hardy?

Helping me with my shot?
Gee, that's original.

You're not keeping your wrists locked.

Where'd you get this move, Wallace?
A Nelson Eddy movie?

What is it?

Come on!

Hurry up! Come on!

<i>B-'H.</i>

<i>I fell into a burning ring of fire</i>

<i>I went down, down, down
and the flames went higher</i>

<i>and it bums, bums, bums</i>

<i>that ring of fire, that ring of fire</i>

Back up!

<i>I don't want to set the world</i>

<i>on fire</i>

<i>I just want to start</i>

<i>A flame in your heart</i>

<i>In my heart! have but one</i>

<i>desire</i>

<i>And that one is you</i>

<i>No other will do</i>

<i>I've lost all ambition</i>

<i>for worldly acclaim</i>

<i>I just want to be the one you love</i>

<i>And with your admission</i>

<i>that you feel the same</i>

<i>I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of</i>

Believe me

<i>I don't want to set the world</i>

<i>on fire</i>

<i>I just want to start</i>

<i>A flame in your heart</i>

See you later, Wilder.

Can you hear me?

I know what you're thinking!

We didn't do anything!

We didn't do it!

Say something!

Okay.

This is good.

It's morning, it's sunny.

We're gonna eat breakfast...

and then we need to sit down and talk.

The three of us.

We've all made mistakes.
We need to get things out in the open.

We need to establish a dialogue.
We need to talk about our feelings.

Got any cereal?

Wilder is repressing his emotions.
He always represses his emotions.

I think if the three of us
could just put our problems into words...

just verbalize...

Get off that goddamn mower, now!

I made your breakfast! You come and get it!

I'm talking to you!

Stop it!

Do something!

All right, look.

This is me. This is the way I feel right now.

It's early. I'm tired.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

I was with your wife.

I'm eating your breakfast.

So come on, take a swing at me, please?
And let's get this thing over with.

Come on, you freaking iceman.

Okay then, it's official now.

You're a frightened coward.

Sorry, pissant clown!

Think you can mess around with my wife?

Don't! No!

You're dead, white boy!

Let's go pick out a nice wreath for you
because you're freaking dead!

All right! Stop it now!

Both of you! I live here, damn it!

What do you want to do?
You want to kill each other?

Thought that's what you wanted.

Your shoe's on fire.

Who's the white boy now?

Dirty, mud-hopping rat bastard!

Come out and fight
like the freak of nature you are...

or I'm coming in there to get you!

Let's say, for once in our lives,
that we have us a fair fight!

Flame me, boy! Burn my hair off!

Give me a reason to barbecue you!

Stop it!

Wait until I get my hands on...
Your ass is ash, Wilder!

Nobody's ass is anything! Do you hear me?

Nobody's ass is anything!
You boys come out of there now!

Hi, this is Vida Foudroyant.

We have another one
of those little situations here.

Okay, boy! Here it comes!

Run!

Are you okay?

You Okay?

Use your powers for once in your life!

Use them, you pussy!

Quit it.

Oh, my God! There's fire by the--

I'm coming! I'm okay! Everything's fine.

I'm sorry.

What for?
I'm talking to Wilder.

I'm sorry I was with your brother
on the roof.

It was a bad course of action on my part.

I know I came between you two.

I'm sorry I broke your trust.

I guess what I did was sort of reactionary.

I mean, yesterday
was my first night of freedom...

and you had to spend it calling bingo.

Now, don't get me wrong, bingo's great.

Normally, I'd say bingo's where it's at.

I guess I just got a little crazy. I got selfish.

I figured I'd steal you away...

from squinting at
a bunch of Ping-Pong balls all night.

I figured I'd get you out on the town
for once, for one night of real life.

One night of freedom from that
country-western version of a Soviet gulag.

Wilder, are you gonna say something?

You screwed my brother over bingo?

I think you're missing the big picture.

You and I have very large problems.
No shit.

No shit, Wilder.

I'm tired of doing it all.

I'm tired of coming at you all the time.

And I'm tired of always having to be
the happiest person in a room.

What does he mean
you screwed me over bingo?

There was no screwing.
No screwing occurred.

Only because Zippy the Pinhead here
showed up.

There wouldn't have been any.
The hell there wouldn't have been.

We were gearing up
for some world-class screwing.

We were gonna do something
they haven't even invented a word for yet.

Don't lie.
-It's a moot point.

"Moot point"? Jeez, good answer, honey.

"Did she or didn't she? It's a moot point.

"Pardon me while I go mow the lawn."
God! Why are you with him?

Just shut the hell up, Wallace. Okay?

Rm in jail again.

I'm free one day and I'm in jail again.

This is unbelievable.

I don't even belong here.

You started those two fires.

Me?
Yeah.

Honey, I do not live in a vacuum.

I think we all three share equal blame
for the day's unpleasantries.

I didn't do shit.

I'm clean.

I spent all night putting out some sex fire
that you two started.

This morning I've got her yelling,
"Do something," at me.

I've got you practically wearing my slippers,
smoking my pipe.

You burned down my house,
you wrecked my life...

you steal my wife, and you two want me
to accept part of the blame?

I'm speaking only for myself, Wilder...

but, yeah, I think that would be
the big thing to do.

Fuck you both.

I take that as a no.

Have no fear, the cavalry's here.

Have no fear, the cavalry's here.

Couldn't let my premier attraction
just sit here with the riffraff.

I appreciate it, Rex. I really do.

Just one thing.
Anything, boy. You name it.

Steak dinner?
You want to borrow my sedan?

Some shirt of mine you been admiring?

I don't want to be bailed out
unless you bail her out, too.

We're still thinking about Hollywood,
ain't we, boss?

Every minute of every day.

You're gonna bail me out?

Yeah.

We had to put the Ferris wheel up
for collateral just to cover your bond.

You sure about doing this?

I mean, I know this girl in Tampa,
same hair color, same bone structure.

You're right.

She's worth the Loop-The-Loop.

Hell, she's worth whatever it takes.

Mrs. Foudroyanfs just lucky
the judge gave her a bond at all.

It surprised the hell out of me.

I'm not gonna go
unless you bail out Wilder, too.

All right, bail him out, too.

There goes the shooting gallery.

Okay, come on, Wilder.

Come on, we're getting out of here,
you, me, and Wallace.

Me? Leave with you two?

That makes no sense to me whatsoever.

I mean, I can't think of two people
I hate more in the world.

What part of that didn't you understand?

You win.

I made a big mistake.

I let myself be suckered
by your brother, right?

By the summer night...

and by the need to want to be loved by you.

When you weren't there again,
by the need to be loved by anyone.

I know you think
these mistakes are unforgivable...

and you may be right.

But let me tell you something...

on the one-in-a-million chance
that you're wrong...

on the one-in-a-million chance that
you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning...

and want me back...

you're gonna have to fight for me, Wilder.

<i>Why did you leave me here all alone?</i>

<i>I searched the world over
and thought I'd found true love</i>

<i>but you found another and you was gone</i>

What did he say
when you gave him the notes?

He didn't say anything.
He wasn't there, so I put them in the slot.

What do you mean, he wasn't there?

Vida, you got to give the guy a little time.

I mean, no offense,
but when a man's lost his home...

and his wife in the same day,
he's bound to be a little unpredictable.

He's gonna come back
to the booth eventually...

and when he does, he'll find the notes.
Trust me.

Cover for me.

Was she with him?
Not that I saw.

Hell, he looked totally lost to me.

Maybe he thinks she's still with me.

Rex, I think I'm gonna take a pass
on tonight's show.

I need to save my strength
for a little unfinished family business.

And, Rex...

I want you to make
as much money as you can tonight...

'cause tomorrow morning we're gonna
pack up and head for Hollywood, California.

You got it, Dr. Napalm.

Looks like we might need
that elephant again.

I'm calling you out!

Well, this is a surprise.

Did hell freeze over or what?

Where's Vida?

Out buying more condoms. Why?

Where's Vida?

Actually, she's over at the hospital
being treated for thigh chafe.

Once you've had a clown,
you never go back.

Where's Vida?

She's over at the Sunoco restroom
vaselining up her body...

so she can squeeze into one of these...

the official Dr. Napalm assistant suit.

Soon to be "as seen on TV."

I'm fighting for you, baby!

Get some fire extinguishers!
Get the power back on!

I'm gonna ask you one last time,
where's Vida?

Look outside, asshole.

That's for my pickup truck.

And as for your sorry excuse for a wife...

Vida's not here,
'cause she's a loser, just like you.

You're going on TV over my dead body.

Ruin my home. Ruin my marriage.

I'll be damned
if you're gonna ruin the rest of my life.

You self-hating freak.

It's a gift...

not a curse.

And you don't deserve it. Just like
you don't deserve that woman you're with.

Don't tell me what I do--
<i>- I'll</i> tell you whatever I like!

Ever since we were kids,
ever since Horace Braintree's clubhouse...

when you convinced yourself
and damn-near convinced me...

that we were murderers,
you've dreaded who we are!

We didn't do anything, Wilder.

We didn't know that man was in there!
We were little kids!

Midlothian Shopping Center.
Multiple fires. Lord, what a day!

Look what that guy's doing
to our meal ticket.

-It's gonna blow!
Get the hell out of here! Come on.

Come on!

Come on, sweetie!

The doctor is in!

Get off of him. Get out of the way.

Get out of that silly suit and stop this now!

My arm!

Oh, no. You think I killed him?

I might have killed him.

Good shot, Wilder!

Get back!

I'm not fighting you anymore, Wallace.

There's no reason to fight anymore.

You win.

Everybody knows.

You win.

Don't give me that sanctimonious shit!

It's over 'cause you say it's over?

You don't get it, do you,
you passive-aggressive pissant?

You are not wiping away 32 years...

of making me feel like a piece of crap...

simply because you choose not to fight!

Now get up and flame on!

I'm gonna take my wife for a spin
on the Tilt-A-Whirl.

Want to come?

What?
I'm not fighting you.

Then you're burning!

Go!

It's all right, folks. Everything's fine.

Don't run. Everything's under control.

Okay, the Ferris wheel!

Okay!

One way or the other, brother,
you're gonna burn!

We are running out of places to go!

All right, coming through.

All right, already.
So, who's got the bigger one?

Biff the Clown, near as I can tell.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Are you gonna walk over to those deputies?

Me, too.

Okay.

Yeah, good.

Shoot! He's already on.

<i>Here he is, Dr. Napalm.</i>

<i>Great to see you. How are you?</i>

<i>How much time do you actually have left?
Is it four months until your parole?</i>

<i>That's correct, David, four months,

What time do you have to go back to work?

My last set doesn't start until 1:00.

<i>Whenever I'm with her</i>

<i>Something inside</i>

<i>Starts to b urn in'</i>

<i>And I'm filled with desire</i>

<i>Could it be a devil in me</i>

<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

<i>Burning in my heart</i>

<i>I can't keep from cryin'</i>

<i>It's tearin' me apart</i>

Whenever she <i>calls my</i> name

<i>So slow, sweet and plain</i>

<i>Right then, right there</i>

<i>I feel that burnin' flame</i>

<i>Has high blood pressure got a hold on me?</i>

Sometimes {stare in space

<i>Tears all over my face</i>

<i>Can't explain it, don't understand it</i>

<i>I ain't never felt like this before</i>

<i>This funny feeling has me amazed</i>

<i>don't know what to do, my head's in a haze</i>

<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

<i>Well, it's all right, girl</i>

<i>go ahead, girl</i>

<i>Well, it's all right, girl
Ain't nothing but love, girl</i>

<i>Don't pass up this chance</i>

<i>This time ifs true romance</i>

<i>It's like a heat wave</i>

<i>Burning, burning, burning, yeah</i>

<i>- Heat wave

<i>Burning, burning, burning, yeah</i>
