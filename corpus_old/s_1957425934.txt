Why don't you go inside, Jonathan?
I'll park the car and meet you there.

Can I help you?

I think I need to register?
I just transferred here.

I'm curious, Jonathan.

Did you dress like this
when your father was alive?

Like what?

No, he didn't dress like this back then.

That was three years ago, Mom.

I'm not going to dress the same
way I did when I was thirteen.

I was just answering the question.

You bought me this shirt.

Well, it is a cool shirt.

And the earrings.

Jonathan, all your tests indicate
you're a very smart young man

but I've been looking over
your transcripts from Portsmouth,

and your grades have been declining
since your father passed on.

Ms. Blackhead.
Whitehead.

We were both in pretty rough shape
after Bill died.

She was a wreck.

Thank you. Frankly,

I would have been more surprised
if Jonathan's grades hadn't suffered.

I understand.

My concern is that Jonathan's appearance
seems to indicate that he might be...

Suicidal?

Depressed.

No. I'm fine.

We're both fine.

We just needed something
a little different.

And this sure is different.

That's the bell for second period.

Jonathan, why don't you head to class
while I talk to your Mom.

Here's your schedule
You've got American History right now.

That's just down the hall. Room 27.
Mr. Allen knows to expect you.

Have a great day, honey.
See you at home, okay?

Okay.

I understand you're the new
assistant librarian.

That's right.

You'll like working with Mrs. Henniker.

She's been running that place
since I was in high school.

What the fuck? Is it Halloween already?

At that time,

New England was as heavily involved
in the slave trade as the Southern states.

Some of the more prosperous families
in Dunkirk, in fact, gained their wealth

from the transport of slaves up and down
the Eastern coast.

But we mustn't judge them too harshly.

This was considered to be
a respectable enterprise, in those days.

"Set's Lament."

May I?

"How beautiful you were, Osiris,
My brother, My king."

"How I adored you,
My lover, My king."

"Had I not killed you,
You could never have tasted Death."

"Had I not rended you,
You could never have been reborn."

"Had I not," - what's this?
"sacrificed you."

"You could never have become
what you are."

""Can you not see how much I loved you?"

An interesting re-interpretation
of mythology, Mr. Kelly.

But I'm not sure if the ancient
Egyptians would have approved

of Set calling Osiris his "lover."

Fag.

I liked it.

Now, where were we?

Slaves were of course not the only
commodity traded along the seacoast.

Sugar, salt and other cooking spices

were difficult for the colonists
to come by and fetched a fair price.

Jonathan!

Did I get your name right?

Yes.

Allen likes to bully anyone
who isn't hanging on his every word.

But it was a nice poem.

Thanks. It wasn't finished yet.

My name's David.

Hi.

No, I'm not a Satanist. It's

I know what it is.

There's a coffee shop downtown.
Meet me there after school.

Hey! Go get us a table in the back.

I'll get us some coffee.
You like cream and sugar?

No. Thanks. Just black.

Hope you like dark roast.

That's fine. Thanks.

So, you're a witch, right?

Or are you just wearing that pentacle
because you think it's cool?

I don't do anything just to be cool.

Know what that is?

'The Grimoire of Armadel.'
It says so right on the cover.

No shit.
I mean, do you know anything about it?

I know it's crap.

There were a ton of fake grimoires
popping up all over Europe

during the witch craze.

Most of this is ripped off
from older works.

You knew that.

Sure. But until today, I was the only
one in this fuckin' town who knew it.

This is a first printing
of the Mathers translation.

It must be worth a fortune!

A couple hundred bucks, at least.

There's an antiques dealer in town
who has a few of these kicking around.

He lets me borrow one now and again.

Why?

He knows me.
He knows ['ll take care of them.

No, I mean,
"Why are you reading them?"

Why are you?

You aren't trying to summon a demon?

Well, I did try.

The incense gave me a
fuckin' headache, that was about it.

What about you?

I wasn't trying to summon demons...

You can do magic, though, can't you?

Some. Nothing much.

Like what?

I cast some spells - to pass a test,
or find something I've lost.

Stuff like that.

And they work?
I guess so.

How can you tell?

Even if you get what you want,
how do you know it's not coincidence?

<i>Well.. There's something else.</i>

Sometimes, I can sort of put thoughts
into people's minds.

Make them do something,
right at that moment,

they wouldn't have done normally.

That doesn't seem like coincidence.

Can you put a thought into my mind?

Yeah, whatever.

It doesn't work if
you're expecting me to do it.

You expect me to believe
you made her do that?

All right, you pick one.

That guy, make him drop his coffee.

What did he do to you?

Trust me, he's a dick.

I want you to teach me.

"Come and see what the mirror of fate
will show you."

'Vampire Circus' 1972.

Fuckin' Al.

All right. I've got one for you.

"Good and evil are so close, they
are chained together in the soul."

Come on.

I don't know that one.

That's because you watch
too many vampire movies.

I watch mummy movies, too.

You gotta broaden your horizons.

Well, what the fuck is the movie?

'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' 1941.

Hi, Jonathan. Who's your friend?

His name's David, uh...

Ross.

Hi, David!

Hi, Mrs. Kelly.

Would you like to come inside?
I think we have some cake left.

No, thanks. I have to get going.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

Sure.

Seeâ€? The first day,
and you're already making friends!

Aaron! I'm not gonna warn you again
about elbowing people!

The runt was in my way, Coach!!

That's enough!

You okay, Johnny? Good boy!

Foul on Aaron, free throw for Johnny.
Give me the ball?

Hey! Jonathan!

Where's the nearest bathroom?

Isn't there one in there?

I mean, one with doors on the stalls.

They don't have doors?

How long have you been going
to this school?

I've never been in there.

Haven't you ever been to gym?

Nope. Never.

How'd you wrangle that?

I've got a bad heart.

Really?

So my doctor says.

I've had it since birth
No sports or heavy exertion allowed.

Wish I had a bad heart.

In 1784, a ship called the Mariposa
arrived in Dunkirk Harbor.

It was transporting goods from Africa,
which included about 75 African slaves.

Unfortunately, one of the sailors on
board had - it's been surmised

contracted smallpox in their last port.

It spread rapidly throughout the crew.

Nearly four months later,
on a chill, foggy September morning,

the Mariposa drifted into Dunkirk Harbor,

where, like the Demeter
in Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula,

it crashed into the dock
with no one at the helm.

Some of the local men went aboard

and found a few of the crew still
alive, too weak to move.

No one had been below decks for weeks.

Were all the slaves dead?

Most were.

Some were still alive - barely

still manacled to the corpses
of their companions.

They had kept themselves alive
by resorting to cannibalism.

But the story doesn't end there.

The men who climbed aboard the Mariposa
had now been exposed to the disease.

It spread through the town like wildfire.

By the end of the winter, between
smallpox and other diseases,

over fifty of the town-folk were dead,

their bodies literally piled
in the unheated meeting house,

the ground was too frozen to bury them.

The building was kept locked, of course.

Some of our founding fathers were
among the dead,

August Pierce, Josiah Corwin
and Nathan Sawyer.

In Spring, the North end
of the cemetery was dug up

and all of the bodies were interred

in a single mass grave
with one stone marker.

I've been through that cemetery
a thousand times.

Everyone knows there's
supposed to be a mass grave,

but it's not there.

Within a few years, the bodies
had rotted away underground,

as could be expected.

The grave dropped by several
feet and was covered over again.

The stone is still there, Mr. Sherman,
but covered by several feet of earth.

Nobody ever put up a hew one.

Mr. Allen?
Yes, Miss Russell?

What happened to the slaves?
The ones who were still alive?

In a vain attempt to prevent the disease
from coming ashore,

the cargo hold was locked,
and the ship was taken out to sea.

There, it was set aflame.

With them still alive?

With them still alive.

So, how are you with ghosts?

What do you mean, "how am I?"

You know. Can you talk to them,
or see them, or anything?

I tried. I didn't have much luck.

You're thinking of going to that
cemetery, aren't you.

Sure. Why not?

For one thing, half the kids in class
are probably up there

looking for sunken gravestones.

We don't have to go right now.

We can go tonight, after dark.

I dunno. I'm pretty beat.

I had this really wacked
nightmare last night.

Ah, it's the weekend.

You can sleep tomorrow morning.

Mr. Allen didn't say anything about
there being ghosts there.

Come on! It's the greatest disaster
in Dunkirk's history!

There's got to be a
couple of ghosts in there.

You've lived here your whole life?

More or less.

Has anyone seen a ghost
in that cemetery?

I don't know. But look, we won't
just wander in and hope one appears.

We'll do a spell or something, to try to
contact one.

Well, I still have a Ouija board...

Perfect! We'll use that.

The cemetery's just up the
road from here.

You're practically living
right next to it.

Midnight tonight, go up this hill, about
a quarter of a mile.

I'll be waiting at the gate.

To jump out and scare the shit out of me.

Come on! Don't be a wimp.

This will be great!

Jonathan? How was school?

Fine.

I'm planning dinner for five o'clock.

Okay.

Spirits of those who lie buried
beneath us, can you hear us?

Is there anybody who wishes
to speak to us?

They're old. Maybe they're
hard of hearing.

Shh! We're trying to reach those
who died of smallpox in the year 1784.

Is there anyone who would like
to talk to us?

"Yes!"

You pushed it there!

No, I didn't! I swear.

You're jerking me around.

I'm not! Ask it something else.

Are one of those
who died of smallpox?

"No!"

How did you die?

What's your name?

I...

<i>know</i>

<i>you</i>

"I know you?"
What's that supposed to mean?

Quiet! Someone's coming!

(Gangling keys)

Salve, magne domine Lucifer,
te salutamus!

Nos adiuvare atque nostros
Investigationem succurrere

et finem subvenire te rogamus.


(crunch of wood)

Careful! I don't want it damaged!

Beautiful...

Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

Fill it back in.

Christ! They took so long, I thought I
was going to fucking wet myself!

I am so fucking cold.

Have you heard of Tobias Corwin?

No. But Corwin's a big name around town.

The family's been here forever.

What about these symbols?

Isn't that the Masons?

No. I mean, yes, those are,
but not this one.

I've never seen anything
like that before.

I couldn't catch much of what
that guy was saying.

I'm not that good with Latin, anyway.

But I'm sure I heard him say
something about Lucifer at some point.

<i>"Lucifer? You mean 'Satan?"</i>

More or less.

You're kidding me!

No.

'Satan?' As in a Satanic cult?
In Dunkirk?

Maybe.

I don't even believe in Satan.

Neither do I, really.

The medieval Christian church 
took a minor demon from the Old Testament

and fabricated an arch-nemesis out of him.

But I know how magic works.

Satan has been the focus of black magic
for almost two thousand years.

That makes him powerful.

Are you saying he's real?

As a focus, at least.
As something that can be tapped into.

So what?

Do you really care if some whackos are
running around at night digging up old graves?

Not really.

But I do wonder what they're up to.

Probably trying to bring about
the earthly manifestation of Satan

in the body of a young child,

so he can hasten Armageddon
and unleash all the minions of Hell.

It's what Satanic cults do.

I need to get a look
at old town records.

Why?

There's got to be some reason why
they chose to dig up Tobias Corwin.

The town library has a records room,

But you have to get special permission
to get in there.

Where the hell have you been?

Just down the road.

I thought you got rid of that thing.

No. I put it away for a while.

Were you trying to contact
your father again, Jonathan?

No, Mom. I wasn't.

Well, what were you doing, then?

Mr. Allen was talking yesterday
in American History class

about these early settlers
that died in an epidemic.

They're buried in an unmarked
mass grave, in a cemetery down the road.

So, you thought you'd try
to contact them.

Yeah.

And did you?

Was David with you?

Yes.

Was this your idea or his?

He didn't make me do it.
It was both our idea.

Its a good thing it's not
a school night.

Why don't you go on up to bed.
I have to get ready for work.

Can I go with you?

What for?

I want to look up some stuff
in the town records.

David says there's a room
at the library.

I don't how Mrs. Henniker
would feel about that.

And aren't you tired?

I'm fine. I can sleep later.

Can't you at least ask
Mrs. Henniker? Please?

Al right.

Why don't you go upstairs and take
a shower and put on some clean clothes,

while I finish my coffee.

I can't have you meeting my boss
looking like you slept in a gutter.

I thought I'd find you here.

I went by your house
but you weren't there.

So I thought you might have
come back this way.

I was at the library
most of the day,

Looking up information
on Tobias Corwin.

And?

Not much. He was pretty boring.
He was a trader.

A traitor?

A trader. You know, someone who deals
with imports and exports.

Mostly sugar and coffee.

Slaves weren't a popular commodity
in that time, in the 1800s.

He was born in 1743
and died from influenza in 1849.

He was a hundred and six years old?

His father, Jefferson, lived to be
almost a hundred and twenty.

Maybe they were vampires.

Maybe. I can't find any other reason
why anyone would want to dig them up.

They only dug up one.

Holy shit!

Jefferson Corwin. Died 1819.
Dug up like the other one.

We should check to see if
there are any more like this.

I already have. There's one more.

Another Corwin. Tobias's son, Zachariah.

He died in 1882,
at a hundred and twelve years old.

Three Corwins. All men.
All very long-lived.

And all with this weird
symbol on their headstones.

Maybe it's a family crest.

Not all the Corwins have it.
Not even all the men.

Only the ones who were dug up,

And two more that have yet
to be disturbed.

So you think they're coming back
for those two?

Probably, starting
with Zachariah's son, Samuel.

Are we doing another
midnight stakeout, then?

I haven't slept in twenty-four hours.
I'm not up for another all-nighter.

Come on! You know they're gonna be back
for this Samuel guy.

Just go to bed now,
then you can get up later.

I can't. My mom wants me to meet her
downtown when she gets off work.

She's taking me shopping.

This might look good on you.
What do you think?

It's kind of bright.

It's not black, you mean.

You know, it wouldn't kill you to try
something different for a change.

I like black.

You can at least try it on.

There's a dressing room.

So did you find what you were looking
for in the Corwin Room this morning?

The Corwin Room?

The room you were doing your research
in. Didn't you see the plaque?

No I didn't notice it.

Is it named after Josiah Corwin?

Who's that?

He's one of the founding fathers
of this town

I guess you have been learning something.

It's named after some old man in town
who donated money to the library.

What's his name?

Corwin.

His first name, Mom.

Um, Eli, I think.

Is he still alive?

Oh, yeah. Mrs. Henniker says he runs
an antique store downtown.

Where?

Oh, God. That shirt
looks terrible on you.

Good Afternoon!

Good Afternoon.

Is there anything I can help you with?

Oh, I'm afraid we're just looking.

No harm in that. You Look all you want.
My name's Eli, if you have any questions.

Thank you.

I'm Laura Kelly.
This is my son, Jonathan.

Kelly?

Oh, yes! I've heard about you!
You're the new assistant librarian.

That's me!

Pleased to meet you.

I hear you're renting Ned Donelly's
place, down on Rabbit Hollow Road.

Would you be interested in something
to fix the place up?

I've got a very good end table
that just came in.

Clara Bowdin's mother
passed away last year,

and Clara's just got around
to selling off some of the furniture.

Oh, no, thank you.

We're on a bit of
a tight budget for a while.

Just till things settle down
from the move.

If you're interested
in old books, young man,

I've got a whole bunch of them
in the shelves upstairs.

Feel free to poke around, if you like.

Thanks.

Some of them are rather delicate,
but I'm sure you'll be very careful.

I will.

Now, young lady, you come with me
and take a look.

Don't worry about the cost.

Eli Corwin isn't one to put
anyone in the poorhouse.

Now, it needs
a little bit of touching up.

But I could have it ready for you
in just a few days.

I thought you'd find
these things interesting.

Personally, they give me the creeps.

Then why do you have them?

Oh, they sell well enough.

That Davis you're looking at goes
for over four hundred dollars.

There are people in this town
who collect occult books?

In this town?

I suppose some of the younger kids
might be interested,

But, no offense, they couldn't afford
the more expensive ones.

No, believe it or not I
actually own a computer.

I do a pretty good business online, too.

There's handful of collectors
around the world who think

these nasty things are
worth paying a lot of money for.

To each his own, I guess.

I can't believe how
sweet that old man was!

Do you know how little he asked
for that end table?

It's probably cursed
and kills anyone who owns it.

No! That table is not evil.

I'm sure he's just being nice
because we're new in town.

So, did you satisfy
your curiosity about Eli?

I guess I just wanted to see what
a Corwin who was still breathing looked like.

Hey! You up?

What time is it?

It's about ten.

In the morning?

Of course, "in the morning."

I went to bed about six last night.
I felt like I'd sleep for days.

Sorry. Your mom betrayed you
and let me in when I knocked.

The bitch.

I stopped by the cemetery
on the way over.

Samuel's grave has been dug up.

I thought it might be.

That means Christoph's is next.

So, what do we do now?

Back to the library. I want to find out
more about that family.

Fuckin' research!
Just what I wanted to do on my weekend.

Is that a tattoo?

I'm sorry.

Get your ass out of bed.
I just can't wait to go hit those books!

It looks as if Eli is the
only living Corwin in town.

So we should strike now,
while we have him at a disadvantage!

He had a daughter, Elspeth.

But she died in Louisiana,
almost twelve years ago.

I think he mentioned that once.

Eli's the guy who loaned you
those grimoires, isn't he?

Yeah.

Why didn't you tell me before?

Why? Why does it matter?

He's a Corwin, isn't he?

He's a nice old man
who sells used furniture.

You've watched
more horror films than I have.

Antiques dealers are always evil.

Just like clowns and friendly neighbors
who bring you health drinks.

He is only 73, though.

It's too early to tell if he'll live

to be as old as the ones
with that symbol on their headstones.

I'm telling you, they were vampires.

The townspeople put magic symbols
on their headstones,

so that they wouldn't crawl
out of their graves.

Hi, Mrs. Henniker.

I think they forgot a headstone.

If the town of Dunkirk was living in
constant fear of undead Corwins,

nobody thought it worth writing about.

Everyone seemed to like them.

They named streets and
buildings after them.

I can't find a single bad thing
anybody had to say about them.

Take a look at this.

'Tales of Ghosts and Witchcraft
in Old New England'?

It's better than the shit you're reading.

"In the year 1784, a young woman
by the name of Mary Legget,"

"who had been working as a maidservant
in the Corwin household,"

"began spreading a rumor
around town that Josiah Corwin"

"had repeatedly raped her,"

"and had performed
acts of witchcraft upon her."

"She had recently been dismissed from
the Corwin household,"

"purportedly for theft,
so few believed her story."

"A few months later,
she took her own life."

"It was rumored that she had
given birth to a child, in secret."

"But no trace of a baby was ever found."

That was the same year Josiah Corwin
died of smallpox.

What if she was telling the truth?

What if he really did rape her,
and do some kind of magic spell on her?

Who knows? We're just speculating,
at this point.

Here's something else to speculate about:

What if she didn't really kill herself?

You think Josiah killed her
just to shut her up?

It's possible.

If she died just before
the smallpox epidemic,

there might not have been time
to bury her before Winter set in.

By Spring, there would have been
too many other bodies to deal with.

She may have been thrown
in the mass grave with the rest.

Died during the epidemic,
but not from smallpox.

Speak to us, spirit!

We are trying to reach the spirit
who contacted us two nights ago.

Are you there? Are you
the spirit of Mary Legget?

Jonathan, it's been almost an hour.
I don't think it's going to work tonight.

Just a little longer.

Mary Legget! Can you hear us? Mary

Jonathan! What's happening?

I'm all right. I just...
I saw something.

There's definitely a bunch
of bodies buried underneath us.

And they're not happy.

Did you see Mary? Or Josiah?

There were too many of them.
I couldn't tell one from the other.

Well, we should probably
stop now, anyway.

It's dark, and we don't know

when our friendly neighborhood
Satanic cult is going to stop by.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I've never had anything
like that happen before.

After my father died, I tried
to contact him, every night.

I was obsessed with it.

Nothing ever happened.

Except that my mother took me
to a therapist,

He told her to take away my Ouija board.

How come you still have it, then?

She knew if she took it away,
I'd just get another one.

So we talked about it instead.

She asked me to stop using it,
and I promised I would.

Did you stop?

Yes. Until now.

Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

<i>That's Mrs. Henniker! My mom's boss!</i>

<i>Wow! She's smiling, and her face isn't
even falling off.</i>

Come on!

Prudence Whitehead?

That's Mr. Allen!

I should have known he'd be part
of an evil cult.

Coach Warren, too And - Fuckl!
Police Chief Lewis!

That woman over there
is Dr. Marshfield.

Why is she wearing that red stole?

I don't know. But a few of them are.

Do you know their names?

Jake Dunlap.

Tom Westcott.

Bradley Somerset.

And John Lowry?

I don't see him.

Wait. Over in the far corner,
there he is.

How did you know he would be here?

Wait! There's the guy
with Cristoph's head.

Come! Let us welcome our esteemed guest.

Eli Corwin. He's their leader.

You still haven't told me how you knew
John Lowry would be there.

Because he's one of the six.

Six what?

Don't you know anything
about local politics?

I know they're boring.

Look. John Lowry, Dr. Marshfield,
Mrs. Henniker, Jake Dunlap,

Bradley Somerset and Tom Westcott
are your town Selectmen.

So then this cult is running the town?

There's something else.

In the town records for 1784, those same
six names are listed as Selectmen.

Over two hundred years,
and all six names are still the same!

What are you saying?
That they really are vampires?

Vampires?

The immortal undead.

No! Will you get off this vampire thing?
What I'm saying is...

Do you remember the last time
there was a local election here?

You mean, for Mayor?

For anything!

Not really.

I'm not sure there ever has been.

What if every position of power
in this town has been passed down

from one generation to the next,
keeping the same families in control?

With the Corwins running everything.

I need to get another look
at those town records...

Oh, yay.

Who does that house belong to?

It's the old Corwin house.

Eli owns it now, but nobody's
lived in it since World War II.

Christoph died when Eli was just a kid,

And his mother didn't like living out
there by herself, so they moved into town.

Did Christoph die in the war?

I don't think so.

I remember hearing somewhere
that he committed suicide.

Anyway, I read something in the paper
a few years ago,

about the historical society
wanting to restore it,

but Eli wouldn't let them near it.

No shit!

I'll bet anything he's got
a temple or something set up there.

Let me guess.

You want to go back during the day
and poke around.

Do you think it would be dangerous?

I don't know.

They don't really have much reason
to stake a guard around the place.

As far as they're concerned,
nobody knows about them.

Christoph was the last Corwin left in the
cemetery who had the seal on his headstone.

That means they're nearly ready to do

whatever it is they're planning.

If he was the last,

How do we know they aren't doing this
ritual, or whatever it is right now?

He was the last with the seal
on his headstone,

But he isn't the last Corwin
high priest in the cemetery.

Josiah?

He was the first Corwin to live here,

And if Mary Legget wasn't crazy,
he was practicing magic.

If anyone established
the cult here, it was him.

But they can't have any idea where he is.

I mean, that grave must be maybe
ten feet deep and twice that across.

There are over fifty bodies in it!

That'll slow them down.

But if they really know
how to use magic,

they should be able
to divine where he is.

Then I guess we don't have any choice.

If we want to find out
what they're doing before they do it,

we'll have to break into that house.

Mr. Kelly!

Am I boring you, Mr. Kelly?

Or perhaps you'd like
to see the school nurse?

He's fine.

Please try to pay attention, Mr. Kelly.

How do you do that thing with Mr. Allen?

What thing?

Intimidate him like that.

Allen's a prissy little snot.

He probably got picked on
when he was in school,

So how he's taking it out
on his students.

Just stand up to him.

I can make him back down, because
he knows I'm not afraid to kick his ass.

I never pictured you as someone who goes
around kicking ass.

I used to do a lot of it
when I was younger.

These days, I don't get
into fights very often,

<i>But of course I've got a rep now
So people avoid pissing me off.</i>

Where are we?

We're almost there.

We didn't pass this last night.

I took us down a different path.

This is the south side of the property.

Something doesn't feel right.

What? It's just an old barn.

Want to go check it out?

No!

David!

I think you were right.

We should have kept on walking.

What the fuck is that?

Someone has been doing a ritual out here.

Why would they do that?

Killing things, sacrificing them,
can lend more power to the ritual.

Do you do that?

No!

Let's get the fuck out of here.

What if somebody's in there?

We kick their asses.

Did you bring a weapon?

I'm not afraid of a bunch of old people.

Those two guys in the cemetery
didn't exactly look infirm.

They could be Renfields.

Renfields? People who eat bugs?

Henchmen.

Come on. Don't be a wuss.

I thought we might run into
one or two of these.

Wait! They'll know someone was here.

They'll know someone was here.
But they won't know who.

This is where they gathered last night.

Has Eli sold off all the furniture?

I don't know. Maybe.

You wanna check upstairs?

They didn't go upstairs.
They went back towards where we came in.

You're the one who keeps saying.

Evil Satanic zombies are going to jump out
and kill us at any moment.

The least we can do is check upstairs,

Make sure nobody's here first
before we do anything else.

You first.

Fine. It's always the guy in the rear
who gets it, anyway.

I don't know, Jonathan...

It has to be in here.

We've looked everywhere else,
and we know they didn't go outside.

There's no way all those people
could fit in this tiny space.

Maybe they stayed out in the mud room.

Please tell me you're not looking
for a secret door.

Give me the flashlight.

These boards slide back into the wall.

You want me to go first?

Well, isn't this medieval.

Not medieval.
Not even eighteenth century.

This wasn't built in Josiah Corwin's day.

How do you know?

I don't think they used cement
in the seventeen-hundreds.

Looks to me like somebody rebuilt this
in the last fifty years or so.

They probably had to redo the walls

the last time a demon got loose
and drenched them in human blood.

After you.

I think we found it.

I was right.
There's still one missing.

These pages are vellum.

Vellum?

Cured lambskin.
At least, I hope it's lambskin.

This stuff is really twisted,
even for me.

What do you mean?

It's all blood sacrifice.
Dogs, cats, goats, chickens...

It's not here.

What's not there?

The ritual. There's nothing in here
that involves collecting heads.

No, there wouldn't be.

What are you doing?

You've gone as far as you can, on your
own. It's time I told you the truth.

What truth?

What happened to you?

They happened to me.

You already knew about Eli
and his coven.

Jonathan.

You knew exactly where this chamber was.

I needed you to see this

I don't want to see anything!

Jonathan!

Oh, shit.

This isn't happening.

Anubis, guide of the Underworld,
show me the path to safety.

Anubis, guide of the Underworld,
show me the path to safety.

Anubis, guide of the Underworld,
show me the path to safety.

Ani! Ani, come!

Hey, are you okay?

I'm fine.

Hello?

Oh, hi, David!

No, I'm sorry.
He actually went to bed early tonight.

He wasn't feeling very well.

Sure, I'll tell him.

You too. Have a good night.

<i>(tap on window)</i>

What the fuck do you want?

I want to talk to you.

Get the fuck away from here!
You're going to wake up my mother.

I'm not leaving till you come down.

Over here.

All right. What do you want?

I want you to understand.

I understand.

You're part of the coven, and you
were grooming me for the next sacrifice.

No! I'm not part of the coven.

I would never do anything
to hurt you, Jonathan.

It's just... I needed your help.

So you lied to me,

And put me through a lot of trouble
to dig up information you already knew.

If I had told you flat out that
this nice, sweet, old antique shop owner

was the leader of a Satanic coven,

that they were doing this to me,

You would have thought I was crazy.

Admit it.

You would've thought
I was cutting myself up.

And just making up all these
paranoid fantasies to justify it.

It's time you told me
exactly what's going on.

My mother was Eli's daughter.

Maybe she could have even taken his place
as grandmaster of the coven one day

I think he was preparing her for it.

But he's a sick fuck.

Some of her 'training' involved
being tied down during the rituals,

So he could rape her.

He's you're father.

She ran away, down to Louisiana.

Maybe she thought
she could hide from him.

After I was born,
she legally changed our name to Ross.

We lived there maybe about five years,
before he killed her.

How?

A car accident.

But you don't think it was an accident.

She left me standing there,

In a supermarket parking lot
next to a cart of groceries.

Then she got in the car,

And then she drove off across
three lanes of traffic...

And head first into a semi.

He can make you see things, Jonathan.

Things that aren't really there.

How'd you get back then?

He showed up the day of the funeral.

I don't know how; I mean, my name
was different from his, and everything.

But somehow he got custody of me.

He brought me back here and then...

What did he do to you, David?

The same things he did to my mother.

And worse.

Why would he cut you like that?

You said it yourself,

Killing things can give you power.

Well, so can torturing them.

And you've been keeping
your scars hidden.

That's why you don't go to gym.

So you won't have to take
your clothes off in front of anyone.

That was arranged by Dr. Marshfield.

You think Eli will kill you,
if you try to leave?

I know he will.

There's something I haven't
told you about yet.

What?

I knew you wouldn't find the ritual
you were looking for

in the coven's Book of Shadows.

There's a special book, passed down
through the generations.

Only a grandmaster is ever allowed
to read from it.

But you have.

I suspected weeks ago
that he was planning something.

Something big.

So I broke into his study.
I found the ritual and copied it.

He intends to kill you.

The first human sacrifice in Dunkirk
in over a century.

There's something that doesn't add up.

This isn't some ancient ritual,
passed down through generations.

None of the past grandmasters went
around digging up their predecessors,

Or else they wouldn't be there
for Eli to dig up now.

He wrote it himself. He's trying
to tap into their power; absorb it.

And extend his life.

By taking mine.

What are you going to do?

You saw for yourself. He's only got
five heads. He needs six.

Why? He made it up.

There's no reason he can't rewrite it
for five heads if he wants to.

You know how magic works, Jonathan.

In order for this ritual to work,
everything has to line up perfectly.

All the symbols have to click into place.

If he changes the symbolism around
everything will start to unravel.

Everything is centered
around this symbol.

The Corwin family seal.

It has seven points.

There has to be a head
at each of these points.

Then Eli has to stand here.

It won't work with only five heads.

So you need to stop him
from digging up Josiah.

He's already being stopped.

Even if he digs up the entire mass grave,

he won't be able to tell
which body is Josiah's.

Do you know why?

Mary Legget.

She's blocking all the Corwins
from finding that body. Even me.

Because Josiah murdered her.

No. Because he sacrificed her child.

Then why doesn't Eli get one of the
other coven members to find the body?

They're just parasites.
They don't have any real power.

But you do, Jonathan.

So you decided to recruit me?
80 I could help you find Josiah?

It doesn't mean I don't like you
for other reasons.

But the only way to stop the ritual

is to find that head
first, and destroy it.

Why can't we just leave it where it is,
where Eli can't get to it?

How long do you think
Mary can hold him off?

She had some natural magic ability,
but no real training.

Her hatred of the Corwins
has made her strong,

But he'll find a way to get past her.

It's just a matter of time.

I need you, Jonathan.

I have to get Josiah's body
before Eli does,

And you're the only one who can find it.

I already know where it is.

It was by a little pine tree...

There! That's it.

Are you sure?

Positive.

Wait!

Maybe it's not such a good idea for you
to help me with the digging.

What, afraid Mary might strike me dead?

She's kept me from finding the body,
but she won't keep me from digging it up.

Will your mom freak
if she doesn't find you in your bed?

She leaves for work before I get up.

I'm hoping she's not going
to notice I'm gone.

I wonder if we'll run into
that missing grave marker.

No.

I think it's somewhere over in that area.

What?

You're so weird.

I'm not the one whose family
does human sacrifice.

All right. Break time's over.

The prospect of letting Eli kill you
is starting to look more appealing.

Fuck you.

I don't have the energy.

Get off your ass and help me!

Jonathan! Come here!

That's not him.

We have to get past
a few other bodies first.

So you're the great Josiah Corwin.

I always thought you'd be taller.

What are you going to do with it?

Should we fill it back in?

I don't have the strength.
We can finish it tomorrow.

Don't you think we should
at least cover up the bodies?

Okay. But just enough
to cover them for now.

And then I can figure out how the hell
I'm going to explain to my Mom

where the fuck I've been all day.

Can I ride in with you tomorrow?

To the library? What about school?

I can walk to school from there.

I just need to check a few things
in the Corwin room first.

I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

Mrs. Henniker doesn't want you
in there for a little while.

Why not?

It's not you, particularly.

She doesn't trust David.

I guess he has a reputation
around town for getting into trouble.

That old bitch!

Hey! Did I raise you to talk like that?

I know Mrs. Henniker
isn't exactly warm and fuzzy,

But she's been going through
a real rough time lately.

The four-year-old who disappeared?
Did you hear about that?

Yeah.

Well, he was her grandson.

He was just playing
in his mother's back yard and vanished.

His mother's back yard?
Not his parent's back yard?

What do you mean?

Was Bobby Henniker's mother married?

Well, now that you mention it, I've never
heard anything about Bobby's father.

People always talk as if
it were just Bobby and his mother.

I don't really know. Mrs. Henniker
doesn't talk about it herself.

I'm just hearing gossip from the locals.

Jonathan...

Has David been asking you to do anything
that you don't feel comfortable with?

Like give him a blow-job?

I assume you can make up
your own mind about sex.

I meant, has he been
asking you to do anything

that can get you into
trouble with the law?

No.

David already told me
he was in trouble when he was younger.

That doesn't mean he's a troublemaker now.

Well, I'm not going to tell you
to stay away from him.

But please be careful.

Without any return, and without
having made any acquisition...

Oh, hello, Elil How are you doing?

I'm doing well. How are you?

I'm good! Please, come inside.

Your table is finished,
so I thought I'd stop by.

And deliver it in person.
I hope you don't mind.

Oh, no! Not at all!
That was really nice of you.

It was no trouble.

Good afternoon, Jonathan.

Jonathan, would you mind coming down
and taking this table from Eli?

Could I get you some coffee? Or tea?

Tea would be nice.

I'll be right back.

Jonathan, why don't you show Eli
into the living room.

This way. Please.

Thank you.

I noticed David wasn't in school today.

No. He wasn't feeling well this morning.

It isn't really healthy
for young boys to be out at all hours,

getting into mischief.

But maybe you think
I'm a stuffy old man, eh?

I suppose at your age,
everything seems like an adventure.

Speaking of which -
on David's latest little adventure,

he seems to have misplaced something.

Something that, well,
really doesn't belong to him.

A family heirloom, of sorts.

You wouldn't happen
to have seen it, would you?

No, I don't think so.

Well, perhaps you could
keep an eye out for it.

I might even be willing to offer
a small reward for its safe return,

Say a hundred dollars?

I'll keep an eye out for it.

Please do.

I'm may be getting superstitious
in my old age,

But things like this
always strike me as bad omens.

As if something awful might happen,
if it doesn't show up soon.

Jonathan!

Hello, Jonathan.

You're okay. You just fainted.

Here you go.

Where's Eli?

He's gone home.

He shouted to me, when you passed out.

Luckily, he had Dr. Marshfield's number.

And she was able
to come out on short notice.

How are you feeling, Jonathan?
Are you dizzy? Any headache or nausea?

I'm just a little tired.

There does seem to be
a mild flu going around.

Eli's grandson David
hasn't been feeling well, either.

David? I had no idea
he was Eli's grandson.

Jonathan's been hanging out
with him a lot, lately.

That might explain it, then.

You should probably stay in bed
for the rest of the day.

I know it's a clichÃ©, but drink
a lot of fluids. It'll help.

I don't think I need that.

There's nothing
to be afraid of, Jonathan.

This will just
help you sleep for a while.

He hasn't been sleeping very well
the past few days.

That might be what brought this on...

I'm fine.

Jonathan! You've never had
a problem with shots before.

There. It's all over now.
Just lie back and relax.

I'm sure he'll be fine.

But don't hesitate to call if he starts
showing any other signs of illness.

Thanks, Dr. Marshfield.

Here's my card in case
you need to contact me.

Great. How much do I owe you?

Don't worry about it.
The first one's on the house.

That's very nice of you.

You have a great night.

Likewise.

Thanks for stopping by.

How are you feeling now?

I'm fine.

Do you think you'll be all right
on your own for a few hours tonight?

I promised Mrs. Henniker
I'd help her with inventory.

I hate leaving you here like this.

Okay...

I'll probably be back
before you even wake up.

Mom?

Jonathan Kelly?
Yes.

I'm sorry, son.
Your mother's been in an accident.

What?

We're to take you
to the hospital in Everett.

She's not dead.
No, but she's hurt pretty bad.

Why don't you get your coat
and come with me.

(Gangling keys)

I think I forgot to lock the door.

It's fine.

Good evening, Jonathan.

It was a lie.
My mother hasn't been in an accident.

Hasn't she?

I don't play games, Jonathan.

Your mother is in the intensive care
unit at Everett Memorial.

They're not certain
she'll last the night.

You did it.

As I'm sure my grandson has told you.

He's your son.

He is the son of my daughter;
that makes him my grandson.

Don't go head to head with me, Jonathan.
You don't know what you're up against.

Now. You're a very smart boy,
and I respect that.

I'm also certain that David
has put you up to this.

So I am prepared
to give you one final chance.

You have one hour to bring
that skull to me at Corwin House.

Don't tell me you don't know where it is;
I know you've been there.

If you do exactly as I say
your mother may recover.

If you do not, she will die.

What about David?

I will deal with David as I see fit.

You may go.

Everett Memorial Hospital.
How may I direct your call?

I need to know if someone was taken
to the emergency room tonight.

Hold, please.

<i>ER. How may I help you?</i>

My name's Jonathan Kelly.

I'm trying to find out
if my mother was taken there tonight.

I'm really not supposed to give out 
information without proof of your identity.

She's my mother! You have to tell me!

Well, what's her first name?

Laura.

Just a moment.

She's been taken to surgery, Jonathan.

Is she... how is she?

There is a way out, Jonathan.
For the both of us.

He's waiting for you downstairs.

Jonathan! So good of you to come.

I assume you've met my apprentice.

Hello, Jonathan.

I believe you have something for me?

Damn! She's blocking me again!

You're the one who dug this up.
Can you identify it?

This is it.

And you're sure?

Yes.

Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

Ah, yes, our guest of honor.

David?

Wait!

I thought you'd like it
if I undressed you, Jonathan.

David, can we get on with this, please?

I've never understood why
he enjoys toying with his kills.

You should see his little
gallery of the macabre in the forest.

You were never
going to be sacrificed, were you?

No, I was.

Yes, I intended it to be David.

The ritual needs the blood
of someone with power.

And David is very powerful.

He's also becoming uncontrollable.

<i>And when he found out
about it, he became.. Difficult.</i>

Finally, I agreed to spare him,

On the condition that
he find a suitable replacement.

Then you came along, Jonathan.

I knew it the moment I saw you.
So much power.

Someday you could be incredible.

If you were still alive, that is.

You've already got my blood!
You don't need to kill me!

Oh no, we'll need much more than
those few drops before we're finished.

Salve, magne domine Lucifer,
te salutamus!

Nos adiuvare atque nostros
Investigationem succurrere

et finem subvenire te rogamus.

David, don't do this.

Don't be afraid, Jonathan.

Pain focuses power, strengthens it.

Believe me, I know.

Salve amplissime Satan!

Accipere hoc sacrificium,
consecrare hoc templum, te quaesemus.

Take this pain and blood in sacrifice!

Expergiscere, nobifis auctor,
te excitamus!

Te salvere jubeo imperator huius mundi!

<i>Nomini Satan qui eum servimus te petimus
nobiscum vim tuae iterum partior!</i>

Hold stilll If I cut too deep
the skin won't stay together.

Yes!

Salve amplissime Satan!

Accipere hoc sacrificium,
consecrare hoc templum, te quaesemus.

Take this pain and blood in sacrifice!

Expergiscere, nobifis auctor,
te excitamus!

Te salvere jubeo imperator huius mundi!

<i>Nomini Satan qui eum servimus te petimus
nobiscum vim tuae iterum partior!</i>

You!

Jonathan!

You knew that wasn't Josiah's skull!

Of course.

What happened to the real one, David?

I smashed it.

No! You wouldn't have!

You're fucked, old man. The pattern's
broken, and you're out of time.

Put down the knife, David.

You don't have any power over me
anymore. You're finished!

Stop him!

Stay where you are!

You little maggot! I should have killed
you along with your mother!

Aren't you going to welcome
our illustrious ancestor?

Do it!

Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus.

What now, David? Is it over?

Almost.

I'm sorry, Jonathan.
I really do like you.

More than like you.

But there's only one way
to complete the ritual.

The ritual is over, David!
Eli's dead now.

Whoever completes the ritual

will have more power
than any single Corwin has ever had.

How can I just throw that away?

David, this is insane.

Lie down on the altar, Jonathan.

I said, lie down!

No!

It's over, David. Let it go.

Put down the knife, Jonathan.

Not this time.

I said, put it down!

Don't make me do this.

I guess you're more powerful
than I thought.

You killed Bobby Henniker, didn't you?

Eli knew he couldn't control you
for much longer,

So he was grooming Bobby to replace you.

You're so beautiful
when you're about to kill someone.

(car sputtering)

I don't know, Jonathan. Maybe I should
take this back to the dealership.

Maybe it's just a loose heat shield
or something.

I can't believe my insurance company
expects me to be able to replace my car

for less than two thousand dollars.

I've got to go, Mom.

Okay.

Hey. I wouldn't worry about David.
I'm sure he's fine.

Maybe he went to visit relatives
and just forgot to tell people in town.

I'll see you after school, Mom.

Have a good day, hon.

Your Mom's got a real nice car, gay boy.
Know where I can get one like it?

Hey, Webber!

Get the hell out of here.

Don't worry. He'll be taken care of.
