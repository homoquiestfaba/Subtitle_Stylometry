MODERN ASTROLOGY IS BASED
ON THE NATAL CHART,

WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
A GALACTIC SNAPSHOT

OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE
ALIGNMENT OF THE PLANETS

AND STARS RELATIVE
TO YOUR LOCATION ON EARTH

THE EXACT MOMENT
OF YOUR BIRTH.


THE CORE BELIEF
IS THAT THIS INFORMATION

IS THEN INTERPRETED
USING THE 12 ZODIAC SIGNS

AS INDICATORS OF BEHAVIOR

TO PREDICT INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY TRAITS.

RIDICULOUS.

(laughs ) <i>I</i> ALMOST BELIEVED.

ALMOST.

ASTROLOGY, A PROPAGANDA
CAMPAIGN OF BULLSHIT.

(dryer buzzes)

YOUR PRESENTATION COUNTS
FOR 40% OF YOUR FINAL GRADE,

SO BE SURE
TO CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE

YOUR TOPIC'S SOCIAL RELEVANCE
WITHIN POP CULTURE.

NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US.

I KNEW YOU
WERE CONCERNED.

SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF CLASS,

AND PRESENTATIONS
ARE ON MONDAY.

I KNOW, SORRY.
I CAN'T STAY.

NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE VITAL IMPORTANCE

OF ETHICS, MR. GIBSON.

EVERY DECISION WE MAKE

HAS SOME ETHICAL
COMPONENT TO IT.

LIKE YOUR DECISION

TO LEAVE CLASS EARLY...

EVEN THOUGH YOU MUST
SUCCESSFULLY PASS IT

IN ORDER TO GRADUATE.

I COMPLETELY AGREE.

.P

OKAY. MOVING ON.

WHEW.

<i>P YOU SAY YOU WILL STAY P</i>

<i>P FORGOT WHAT I CAME HERE FOR P</i>

â™ª  THERE'S SOME SIGNS
ON THE ROAD â™ª

â™ª  TELLING ME
I'M FAR FROM HOME â™ª

<i>P THE TRENCHES OUT HERE P</i>

<i>P MYSELF, I DISAPPEAR P</i>

.P

â™ª  YOUR FRIENDS,
THEY WERE SO CLOSE â™ª

.P

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AS WE PREPARE FOR TAKE-OFF,

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR SEAT
BELTS ARE SECURELY FASTENED

AND TRAY TABLES ARE IN THEIR
UPRIGHT AND LOCKED POSITION.

WE SHOULD BE
TAKING OFF SHORTLY.

<i>P ONE OF THESE DAYS P</i>

ALL RIGHT.

SO, UM, WHERE TO START?

ALL RIGHT, WELL, 75% PERCENT
OF ALL NEWSPAPERS

IN THE UNITED STATES
HAVE A DAILY HOROSCOPE COLUMN.

ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS,
29% PERCENT OF AMERICANS

SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE
IN ASTROLOGY,

EVEN THOUGH
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

STILL CLASSIFIES ASTROLOGY
AS SUPERSTITION

AND NOT AN ACTUAL FORM
OF SCIENCE.

YET THE POPULATION
KEEPS BELIEVING.

(alarm clock buzzing )


SO, WHY ASTROLOGY?

IT ALL STARTED
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

HAPPY BIRTH DAY, BABY.

MMM, I DON'T WANNA
GO TO WORK.

I WANNA STAY HERE.

HELLO.

HEY, DID YOU

NO, I HAVE NO IDEA

WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

YEAH, RIGHT.

YOU KNOW, WHEN EINSTEIN

DEVELOPED HIS FAMOUS THEORY
OF RELATIVITY,

HE WORKED FULL-TIME
AS A CLERK IN A PATENT OFFICE.

DON'T TOUCH MY BOARD.

MM-HMM.

HAPPY BIRTH DAY,
BY THE WAY, OLD MAN.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

OH, HEY, INSTEAD OF GETTING ME
A PRESENT THIS YEAR,

I WOULD REALLY LOVE
A NORMAL ROOMMATE.

HEY, JAKE.
HEY.

FOR ME, WILL YA?

OH, I HATE CONTROVERSY,

SO I AM GONNA MAKE THIS
REALLY SWEET,

REALLY, REALLY SIMPLE.

UM, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE AWARE OR NOT,

BUT CORPORATE SAYS
THAT WE HAVE TO CUT

14% OUTTA THE BUDGET
THIS QUARTER.

AND UNFORTUNATELY,
YOUR DEPARTMENT

WAS IN THE CROSS HAIRS,
MY FRIEND, WHICH IS GRIM.

OH, WOW, THAT IS
NOT A GOOD SWING.

SO, I HAVE TO LET YOU GO.

BUT, UH, I DO HAVE
A TWO-WEEK SEVERANCE PACKAGE

FOR YA EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY.

AND, UH, ALSO, YOU KNOW,
AFTER THAT TIME JAKE,

IF YOU WANNA FILE FOR
UNEMPLOYMENT, KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

GO AHEAD AND FILE 'CAUSE
YOU'VE EARNED IT, BUDDY.

OH, THAT WAS ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD.

I LIKE THAT ONE.

WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT SCHOOL, JAKE.

JUST CALL HR.
THEY'LL LET YOU KNOW.

BUT YOU'RE YOUNG,
YOU'RE BRIGHT, YOU KNOW?

TAKE A TRIP.
GO ON VACATION.

HEY, YOU WANT A SHOT?

JAKE!

COME IN.


BABE?

â™ª  YOU DIDN'T LEAVE

MODERN ASTROLOGY IS BASED
ON THE NATAL CHART.

THE CORE BELIEF IS THAT THIS
INFORMATION IS THEN INTERPRETED

USING THE 12 ZODIAC SIGNS.

ASTROLOGY, A PROPAGANDA
CAMPAIGN OF BULLSHIT.

( Panting )

â™ª YOU GOT WHAT
WAS LEFT OF ME â™ª

SINCE WHEN
DO YOU SMOKE?

JAKE, IT JUST HAPPENED.

IT NEVER JUST HAPPENS.

YOU STILL HERE?

(door closes )

SURPRISE!


<i>P HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU P</i>

<i>P HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR JAKE P</i>

( retching )


OH! WHAT THE--?

COME ON, WHAT THE--?

(line ringing )

911 EMERGENCY.

YEAH, HEY, I'M NOT EVEN SURE
IF THIS IS AN EMERGENCY,

BUT MY, UH, WATER PIPE
JUST BROKE IN MY BATHROOM

AND I HAVE, UH, I HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.

WATER'S EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, OKAY. WHOA, WHOA, STOP.

LISTEN, THERE SHOULD BE A MAIN
SHUT-OFF VALVE IN THE BUILDING.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE MAINTENANCE ROOM IS?

OKAY, YEAH, YEAH, WHOA.

JUST BREATHE.
IT'S OKAY.

DON'T PANIC,
DON'T PANIC.

IT SHOULD BE RED

AND HAVE SOME SORT
OF SIGN NEAR IT.

OH, YEAH...

AH, THERE IT IS!

I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

MY NAME IS JAKE GIBSON.

I WAS BORN FEBRUARY 6th,
1982, AT 10:32 P.M.

AT ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL,
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE
ALSO BORN ON THE SAME NIGHT,

AT THE SAME HOSPITAL,
WITHIN MINUTES OF 10:32 P.M.

HERE WE GOT SARAH REYNOLDS,
YVETTE MONTGOMERY,

AND WESLEY HENDERSON.

THE INTERNET IS KIND OF
AN AMAZING THING.

SO, BASED ON THE THEORY
OF ASTROLOGY,

ALL FOUR OF US SHARE
THE EXACT SAME HOROSCOPE,

AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD ALL
SHARE THE EXACT SAME FATE.

AND THAT'S BULLSHIT.

FOUR PEOPLE,
ONE HOROSCOPE.

FIRST UP,
SARAH REYNOLDS.


(line ringing )

Child: HELLO, LUCY SPEAKING.
HELLO?

YEAH, UH,
IS SARAH THERE?

Woman: WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT PLAYING WITH THE BUZZER?

<i>Child: BUT, MOMMY...</i>

(dial tone)

(line ringing )

HELLO?

DELIVERY.

COME ON UP.

( Buzzes )

STAND UP, PLEASE.
HOLD ON.

WHO IS IT?

YEAH, I, UH, I'M LOOKING
FOR SARAH REYNOLDS.

STAY THERE.

I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

IF YOU'RE NOT OUT
OF HERE IN 30 SECONDS,

I'M GONNA CALL
THE COPS. OKAY?

NO, NO, NO, IT'S --
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

(door slams )

I JUST HAVE

Lucy:
YOU'RE CRAZY.

Sarah: IT WAS
THE MAILMAN GONE AWRY!

â™ª HEY â™ª

( beep)

SARAH REYNOLDS.

CHICAGO.

INITIAL MEETING

WANNA DO SOMETHING ELSE?

UM, YEAH,

GO PLAY,
GET YOUR WILDS OUT.

.P

YEAH.

IT'S GONNA BE
TEN FOR BOTH.

LOOK, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LET ME EXPLAIN.

WAIT A SECOND.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, FEBRUARY
6th, 1982, AT 10:30 P.M.

LOOK, BUDDY,
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.

JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE! PLEASE!

I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS,

AND IF YOU DO NOT TELL
WHOEVER YOU'RE WORKING FOR

TO LEAVE ME ALONE,
I AM GONNA CALL THE COPS.

WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!
AARON.

WHO IS AARON?

YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR AARON?

NO.

<i>THEN WHY...</i>

WHY DID YOU COME
TO MY HOUSE?

THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING...

WE -- WE WERE BOTH BORN

AT ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL
FEBRUARY 6th, 1982,

WITHIN FIVE MINUTES
OF EACH OTHER.

I'M TRYING TO DISPROVE
THE THEORY OF ASTROLOGY

FOR MY ETHICS CLASS.

I HAVE, UH,
SARAH REYNOLDS,

JAKE GIBSON,
YVETTE MONTGOMERY,

AND, UH,
A WESLEY HENDERSON.

OKAY?

WE WERE ALL BORN AT THE SAME
TIME AND THE SAME PLACE.

AND I'M JAKE,
BY THE WAY.

IT'S OKAY. YEAH,
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

YOU SURE?

YEAH, I CAN HANDLE IT.
THANK YOU.

I'M SORRY ABOUT FREAKING
YOU OUT AND EVERYTHING.

IT'S OKAY.
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK.

YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

I'M NOT CRAZY.

I'LL EVEN SHOW YOU MY
RESEARCH PAPERS, IF YOU WANT.

<i>LOOK, I...</i>

I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS,

THAT'S IT.

DOCUMENT WHAT HAPPENED ON YOUR
BIRTHDAY, AND THEN YOU'RE DONE.

MY BIRTHDAY?
YEAH, NOT INTERESTED.

NO, NO, NO, NO.
PLEASE, PLEASE.

LOOK, LOOK.

IN ORDER
TO DISPROVE ASTROLOGY,

I NEED TO COMPARE ALL OF OUR
EXPERIENCES ON THE SAME DAY,

AND A PERSON'S
STRONGEST ZODIAC DAY

OF THE YEAR
IS THEIR BIRTH DATE.

IT'S TOO PERSONAL.

YOU GOTTA GET
OUTTA HERE.

COME ON! FOR ALL I KNOW,

YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF STALKER OR SOMETHING.

.P

GOOD EVENING, SIR.
HELLO.

I'VE BEEN BUSTING
MY ASS AT WORK

FOR, WHAT,
SIX YEARS NOW?

AND FOR WHAT, EXACTLY?

TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE
MY GOLF SWING ON COMPANY TIME?

THE MONEY ONE HAS,
GIVES YOU FREEDOM;

THE MONEY ONE PURSUES,
ENSLAVES YOU.

JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU.

HOW'S YOUR HOTEL'?

REALLY NICE, ACTUALLY.

COULD USE
A BETTER MINI BAR.

SO, HOW'S IT GOING?

SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO DO IT.

WHICH ONE?
SARAH REYNOLDS.

IN ORDER TO DRAW
CONCISE CONCLUSIONS,

ONE MUST HAVE
ACCURATE DATA.

I MEAN, <i>I...</i>
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

GOT ANY IDEAS?

YEAH, IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU GOTTA GO BACK.

YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW,
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT, MAN,
GOOD LUCK.

YEAH, SAME TO YOU.
LATER.

( Beep)


YEAH.

RIGHT, THIS WHOLE
"I'M NOT A STALKER" THING,

IT'S NOT REALLY
WORKING OUT.

YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU GOT HOME SAFE.

IT'S LATE, AND IT'S A
DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD.

YOU COULD
BE DANGEROUS.

TRUE. I COULD.

BUT I'M NOT.

ONE CUP OF COFFEE,
PLEASE?

YOU SHOULDN'T SMOKE.

IT'S BAD FOR YOU.

HMM.

THAT'S WHY I QUIT.

UGH. WHAT TIME IS IT?

WE COULD DO
APPLE PIE, EVEN.

I CAN'T, I JUST --
I GOTTA GO.

COME ON, A CUP OF COFFEE,
THAT'S IT. PLEASE, LISTEN.

I'M DESPERATE HERE, OKAY?

IF I DON'T PASS THIS CLASS,
I DON'T GRADUATE.

JUST A FEW QUESTIONS,
PLEASE.

IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

AND WHO KNOWS?
IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO YOU, TOO.

I MUST BE CRAZY.
FOLLOW ME.

.P

HEY, SARAH.

HI, PATTY,
HOW'S IT GOING?

AH, PRETTY GOOD. YOU?

A LONG NIGHT.

IT'S GOOD.

MAYBE THIS'LL
WARM YOU UP.

THERE YA GO.
THANK YOU.

HE DRIVES
A MERCEDES OR A BMW?

I DON'T KNOW.
YOUR WIFE IS A PROBLEM.

PORSCHE TURBO.
DEFINITELY.

INTERESTING.

YEAH, MAYBE
THAT'S HIS WIFE.

OR HIS DAUGHTER.

OR HIS DAUGHTER, YEAH.

SO, IS THAT GONNA
BE YOU ONE DAY'?

I DO DRIVE A PORSCHE.

IT'S A 1976914 I PAID
LESS THAN THREE GRAND FOR.

OH, WELL, NOT ENTIRELY.

THAT WAS UP UNTIL IT
WAS STOLEN YESTERDAY.

HEY.
I GOT IT. LET'S GO!

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HEY!

GET BACK HERE!

(growls )

SORRY TO HEAR.

MM-HMM, SO I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

AS BAD
AS YOUR DAY WAS,

I GOT YOU BEAT.

IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO BELIEVE.

I'LL MAKE YOU
A DEAL.

IF I CAN MAKE
YOU SMILE,

YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR DAY.

IF I SMILE FIRST,

I WILL WALK OUT
THAT DOOR

AND NEVER BOTHER
YOU AGAIN.

LIKE A STARING CONTEST?
YOU KNOW...

YEAH.
SO, WHAT ARE THE RULES?

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

UM, YOU CAN'T LOOK AWAY,
AND YOU CAN'T SMILE.

YOU FORGET I HAVE
A THREE-YEAR OLD.

<i>OH...</i>

BUT SURE, LET'S PLAY.

EITHER WAY,
I'LL PICK UP THE TAB.

AHEM!

WE STARTED? THIS IS--?
YEAH, NOW WE ARE.

WE CAN BLINK, RIGHT?

SORRY FOR THE WAIT.

SHOULD I COME BACK?

NO, ACTUALLY.

MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
WERE JUST WONDERING

IF YOU WOULD
BE INTERESTED

IN HAVING
A THREESOME WITH US,

A MENAGE A TROIS,
IF YOU WILL.

YEAH.

HE'S JOKING. IT'S NOT...

DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

SHE'S SHY ABOUT
THIS KIND OF THING.

ACTUALLY, WE ARE HERE ON
OUR THREE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY,

AND WE FIGURED YOU LOOKED
LIKE THE TYPE OF GIRL

THAT LIKES TO GET DOWN
AND PARTY. HEE HEE HEE!

HE'S JOKING,
IT'S JUST...

MM-HMM.

THAT'S A WINNER
RIGHT THERE.

WELL, YOU CHEATED.
NO.

I DIDN'T SAY
WE COULDN'T TALK.

I SAID
I WOULDN'T SMILE.

YES! ALL RIGHT.

I AM JUST
ABOUT... READY.

WELL, MY BIRTHDAY SUCKED.

YOU KNOW, I'VE MADE
A LOT OF MISTAKES IN MY LIFE,

SOME BAD DECISIONS,

YOU KNOW, BAD CHOICES.

BUT LUCY --
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER --

WAS NEVER ONE OF THEM.

THIS BAD CHOICE,
WHO I HADN'T SEEN IN TWO YEARS,

DECIDED TO CRASH
MY BIRTHDAY.

ARE YOU CRAZY?

YOU CANNOT BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

NO, MY SOCIAL WORKER'S GONNA
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

LOOK, I NEED TO BORROW
SOME MONEY.

IT'S NOT FOR DRUGS.

LOOK, I'M SERIOUS.

YOU CANNOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW.
I'M SERIOUS, OKAY?

I OWE THIS GUY MONEY YOU
DON'T WANT TO OWE MONEY TO.

WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS!

LOOK, I'M IN TROUBLE.

( Knocking )

UH!

I'LL -- I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE!

PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER, OKAY?

AND IF YOU MESS WITH MY SOCIAL
WORKER, I WILL KILL YOU.

LUCY? LUCY, COME HERE.

COME HERE.
YOU OKAY?

( Knocking )

OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

HEY.
HEY. HI.

HOW'S IT GOING?
OKAY.

WELL, COME ON IN.
WE'RE JUST, <i>UH...</i>

<i>WE'RE, UH...</i>

(door slams )

I HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER
TO SORT OF MONITOR...

MY ACTIONS WITH HER

BECAUSE IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN
AS REGULAR AND SAFE.

<i>SO...</i>

SHE CHECKS ON WHETHER
I'M BEING RESPONSIBLE

AND IF I AM
AN ADEQUATE MOTHER.

HERE YA GO.

I'M SORRY, SARAH, BUT I HAVE
TO REPORT THAT HE WAS HERE.

BUT THEY MIGHT...
I KNOW.

I'M SORRY, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP
THAT HE WAS WASTED.

I DIDN'T EVEN
LET HIM IN.

HE PUSHED HIS WAY IN,
I COULDN'T --

IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WHEN I GOT HERE

HE WAS LESS THAN TEN FEET
FROM LUCY, HIGH AS A KITE.

JUST TELL ME
WHAT I CAN DO.

WELL, YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE
TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD

AND EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

COULD THEY TAKE HER?

I DON'T KNOW.

THEY COULD, I GUESS.

I DON'T REALLY DEAL
WITH THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

ALL I'M SUPPOSED TO DO
IS OBSERVE AND REPORT.

IT'S LIKE
A WHOLE BATTLE NOW.

JUST MAKES EVERYTHING,

EVERYTHING, LIKE ME
PICKING UP THIS FORK,

IT MAKES EVERYTHING
MORE COMPLICATED.

MM-HMM.

AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, MY BIRTHDAY.

WOW.

I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

THAT YOU ACTUALLY TOLD HER
THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A GIRL

THAT LIKED TO GET DOWN
AND PARTY.

I COME HERE A LOT,
YOU KNOW.

READY THIS TIME?

AND NO OFFENSE, BUT NEITHER
OF YOU ARE MY TYPE.

YOU WANNA HEAR
THE SPECIALS?

YES, PLEASE.

SO, YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO WALK YOU HOME?

COULD BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS.

NO, STALKER...
YOU KNOW.

YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

DAMN IT.

WHO, UH, WHO TAKES CARE OF
LUCY WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK?

MY MOM.

LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND
THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE.

I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE,
UM, WHAT THEY SAY, YOU KNOW?

â™ª  AND YOU FELL
INTO THIS BED HEADFIRST â™ª

â™ª EYES WIDE

(clicks off )

( beep)

OKAY, UM, <i>SO...</i>

THIS MORNING
I MET YVETTE MONTGOMERY.

TURNS OUT SHE WORKS

DRUG REHABILITATION CENTER
IN THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO.

<i>P.A.:</i> DR. BURROWS,

AND YOU ARE?

IT'LL JUST BE
A MINUTE.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

YEAH?
SURPRISE.

YVETTE, THIS IS

SORRY, I DIDN'T
CATCH YOUR NAME.

COUSIN, HUH?
SHIT.

DO I KNOW YOU?
NO, YOU DON'T,

UM, AND I'M NOT
YOUR COUSIN, OBVIOUSLY.

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, UM,

BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING...

OKAY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

WELL, I'M HERE
TO LISTEN.

UM, OKAY.
GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

OR BECAUSE SHE REALLY THOUGHT THAT I WAS.

SIR, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
ARE YOU ON SOMETHING?

AM I -- ( laughs)
AM I ON SOME SORT OF -- ?

AND LET'S JUST SAY

THAT SHE TAKES
HER JOB VERY SERIOUSLY.

.P

( arguing)
â™ª  MESSING AROUND â™ª

â™ª  LOOKING FOR FLOWERS
AND DIAMONDS â™ª

CODE RED!

â™ª  SPILLING OUR ICE CUBES
ON THE LAWN â™ª

DO YOU NOT SEE THIS?

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING, OKAY?

GUYS, BACK OFF,
EVERYBODY.

BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THE END
MY STORY DID CHECK OUT.

NOW I'M NOT SURE
IF IT WAS BECAUSE

SHE FELT BAD FOR ASSUMING
I WAS CRAZY

OR BECAUSE SHE REALLY
THOUGHT THAT I WAS.

LOOK AT THIS STUFF
RIGHT THERE.

BUT AFTER I GOT
TO TELL HER EVERYTHING,

SHE FINALLY AGREED TO LET ME
INTERVIEW HER, <i>SO...</i>

( beep)

OKAY, SO, WHENEVER
YOU ARE READY.

UH, FIRST OFF,
MY CAR'S IN THE SHOP.

I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE
SOME SLANTED DOCUMENTARY

WHERE ALL BLACK PEOPLE
RIDE THE TRAIN.

I PROMISE
IT WILL NOT BE THAT.

I HAVE A CAR.

IT'S JUST...
IT'S BROKEN RIGHT NOW.

LISTEN, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
HAVE TO USE THE CAMERA.

IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER TO ME.

IT'S, IT'S FINE.

( Beep)

ALL RIGHT, MY NAME
IS YVETTE MONTGOMERY.

I WAS BORN FEBRUARY 6th,
1982, AT 10:34 P.M.

AT ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL,
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

SAME PLACE AS YOU.

UM, I'M MARRIED
WITH TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.

MY SON IS EIGHT
AND MY DAUGHTER IS SIX.

AND I WORK
THE OVERNIGHT SHIFT

AT A RESIDENTIAL YOUTH TREATMENT
CENTER FOR TROUBLED TEENS.

( Beep)

AFTER WORK,

I GET MY KIDS READY FOR SCHOOL
AND PACK THEIR LUNCHES

AND SEND THEM
ON THEIR WAY.

I SLEEP
WHILE THEY'RE AT SCHOOL

AND WAKE UP IN TIME
TO FIX DINNER.

THEN MY HUSBAND
USUALLY COMES HOME

EXHAUSTED
FROM A 10-HOUR SHIFT,

AND AFTER DINNER
I HEAD BACK TO WORK

AND START IT ALL OVER.

OKAY, BUT WHAT HAPPENED
ON YOUR ACTUAL BIRTHDAY?

<i>UM...</i>


BABY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

ISO NEEDED THIS.

GOT A SITTER
AND WENT OUT TO DINNER

WITH MY HUSBAND
BEFORE WORK.

TYRONE MISSED CALL.

I HAD TO GO
IN EARLY, THOUGH,

'CAUSE WE HAD
A KID MISS CURFEW.

I NEED TO GO
CHECK ON HIM, BABE.

I NEED TO MAKE SURE
HE GETS IN.

IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
UH, I'LL CALL YOU, OKAY?

THE RESTAURANT WAS RIGHT DOWN
THE STREET FROM WHERE I WORK.

I WASN'T ORIGINALLY
SCHEDULED TO GO IN TILL 10:00.

OH, MY GOD!

I DIDN'T EVEN SEE HIM.

OH, MY GOD.

T.! OH, MY GOD!

OH, MY -- OH, MY GOD!

UM, I'M AT,
I'M AT THE CORNER. I JUST HIT --

OH, MY GOD,
WHAT DID I DO?

(dispatch radio buzzes,
sirens wail )

I WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

A BROKEN ARM
AND A SLIGHT CONCUSSION.

THE DOCTOR SAID
HE WAS LUCKY.

THIS IS MY STOP.

TRANSFER TO METRO TRAINS
AT LA SALLE AND VAN BUREN.

THIS IS AN ORANGE LINE TRAIN
TO MIDWAY.

TAKE THE NEXT TRAIN.

IT'LL TAKE YOU
BACK TO YOUR CAR.

O KAY.

UM, AND GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR PRESENTATION.

THANK YOU.

YEAH.

OH, AND HEY, TYRONE?
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

THEN WHY DOES IT
STILL FEEL LIKE IT IS?

<i>P YOU CAN BE HARMLESS P</i>

<i>P AND I WILL BE SHAMELESS P</i>

<i>P AND WE WILL FIND
SOME KIND OF PLACE P</i>

â™ª  THAT WOULD

NO, NO, COME ON.

JESUS.


<i>EH.</i>

IT'S YOUR LIFE.
YOUR CALL.

EH!


I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I SMOKED.

WELL,
IT IS UNNATURAL

TO MAKE NATURE
AGAINST THE LAW.

THAT'S WHAT I THINK.


YOU'VE GOT
A GOOD VOICE.

THANKS.
YEAH.

SERIOUSLY, YOU DO.
THANKS, MAN.

HEY, DO YOU LIKE JAZZ?
YES.

OH, HELLO.

<i>P I LOVE MY HULA GIRL P</i>

BY THE WAY,
HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY.

WAIT, HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY?

BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN
FEBRUARY 6th, 1982,

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS,
ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL.

NO?

HOW THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

BECAUSE, UM,
SO WAS I.

GET THE FUCK OUT.


YOU GOT A GREEN
LIGHT.

I'M EITHER REALLY HIGH,
OR I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED.

I WILL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING, I PROMISE.

JUST THE FACT THAT WE HAD
SHITTY FUCKING BIRTHDAYS,

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

YEAH, THAT IS WEIRD.

FOR BELIEVING IN IT.

'CAUSE I AM NOT
THE STUPID ONE,

OOPSY DAISY.
HEY, I GOT IT!

I AM ACTUALLY IN NEW YORK,
AND AARON IS IN THE HOSPITAL.

-( Lucy thuds, cries )
HE ODed, AND I'M JUST WAITING TO HEAR

TO SEE IF HE'S OKAY.

I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE STOLEN NECKLACE

OR THE MONEY OR ANYTHING.

YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T MY PLACE.

OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

ANYWAYS, JUST, UH,

BYE.
LET'S MAKE A SAND CASTLE.


YOU BROUGHT

HE'S GONNA BE OKAY,

BUT HE HAD A PRETTY
MAJOR OVERDOSE.

HE'S HEAVILY SEDATED

<i>P THIS ISN'T THE MIDDLE P</i>

<i>P THIS ISN'T THE ENDING P</i>

WANNA DO SOMETHING ELSE?

UM, YEAH,
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER.

GO PLAY,
GET YOUR WILDS OUT.

â™ª I PAID THE POLICE

NEW VOICE MESSAGES.

FIRST MESSAGE.

YEAH, THIS IS, UH,
SGT. RAMIREZ, OAKLAND P.D.

CALLING TO INFORM YOU

THAT WE'VE LOCATED
AND RETRIEVED YOUR VEHICLE.

YOU CAN PICK IT UP
AT ANY TIME.

GIVE us A CALL BACK.

-(beep)
Roommate: HEY MAN, IT'S ME.

I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

I'M GONNA BE A FEW MINUTES LATE
PICKING YOU UP.

YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE IT.
I WENT OUT WITH THAT GIRL

FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO
CHRONICLE LAST NIGHT.

IT WAS HUGE!
RIGHT?

AHEM.

TWO MINUTES.
PLEASE.


I LEFT YOU, LIKE,
20 MESSAGES.

THIS CAN'T BE IT.

I MEAN, WHAT COULD YOU...

WHAT COULD YOU SAY
THAT COULD MAKE THINGS OKAY?

YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
THINGS IN LIFE

THAT YOU JUST --
YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK.

I'M SORRY.

YOU ALL RIGHT?


THANK YOU
FOR PICKING ME UP.

ALL RIGHT.

(ala Dr. Strangelove )
ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL,

IN THE WINDY CITY
OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE

HAS BEEN ENGAGED.

THE DOOMSDAY...

<i>OH...</i>

THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE HAS...

BEEN ENGAGED.

I, UH, WASN'T EXACTLY HONEST

WHEN I TOLD YOU
ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY.

I THOUGHT I HAD THE FLU,

UM, IT TURNS OUT

I HAVE, UH, LYMPHOMA.

AND, UH, THEY TOLD ME
THAT I CAN'T, UH,

THAT THEY,
UH, THEY CAN'T, <i>UM...</i>

THERE'S <i>NO...</i>

<i>SO, MAN, JAKE, UH...</i>


AH! JUST LIVE
LIKE YOU MEAN IT,

'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW.

SOAK UP ALL LIFE
HAS TO OFFER.

( Beep)

I DON'T GET IT.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

IF WE ALL HAVE
THE SAME HOROSCOPES

AND HE'S DYING,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

(door opens )

INTERESTING TOPIC CHOICE,
BY THE WAY.

YEAH, THANKS
FOR THE EXTENSION.

WELL, DON'T THANK ME YET.

YOU STILL NEED TO GET
AN "A" TO PASS THE COURSE.

GOD. SON OF A BITCH.

MM. HMM.

SOMETIMES
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION IS

TO FOLLOW THE PROBLEM
TO THE SOURCE.

AH, I SEE YOU'RE A FAN
OF THE COMIC BOOK.

GENTLER ON THE SOUL
THAN HEMINGWAY.

A CHILD'S ABILITY
TO DREAM HAS NO BOUNDARY.

IF WE LIMIT OUR CHOICES

TO THAT
THAT ONLY SEEMS POSSIBLE

OR TO WITHIN
SOCIETY'S VIEWPOINT

OF WHAT IS REALITY OR REASON,

WELL, THEN, THE ONLY DREAM LEFT

IS A COMPROMISE.

SO TRUE.

SO.

IS ASTROLOGY BULLSHIT?

SEEMS LIKE
AN ETHICAL DILEMMA, NO?

I GUESS LIKE
MOST THINGS IN LIFE

IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT IT.

RELATING TO ETHICS, OKAY?

A KEY COMPONENT OF ETHICS
IS THE CORE BELIEF

OF STRIVING
TO LIVE THE GOOD LIFE.

OKAY, AND SO, HAVING
THESE TWO IDEAS,

HAVING -- HAVING ASTROLOGY
AND ETHICS,

JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE SHARE
THE SAME HOROSCOPES,

WE CAN'T ASSUME
THAT THEY WOULD,

THEY WOULD SHARE
THE SAME FATE.

FATE IS NOT
A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT.

FATE CAN BE CHANGED,
ALTERED.

IF I COULD JUST GET YOU
TO SIGN RIGHT THERE.

HAVE A GOOD ONE.
THANKS.

I MEAN, IT IS HOW
WE RESPOND TO FATE,

THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE
THAT DETERMINES WHO WE ARE.

(chuckles )

I LOST MY JOB,

CAR, GIRLFRIEND,

AND APARTMENT IN ONE DAY.

YOU KNOW, BUT THEN,
HOW I RESPONDED TO THAT,

MY CHOICES AFTER THAT,

IT LED ME
TO SOMETHING THAT --

SOMEONE
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

WHETHER YOU CALL IT
LOVE OR FAITH,

AND WHATEVER
YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM IS,

SITUATIONS OCCUR
IN OUR LIVES

THAT ARE SOMETIMES
OUT OF OUR CONTROL.

IT'S HOW WE DEAL
WITH THE ADVERSITY

THAT'S IMPORTANT.

( Phone ringing )
â™ª  FORTUNES... â™ª

HELLO?

HI, I'M LOOKING
FOR WES KNIGHTLY.

SPEAKING.

YEAH, I'M CALLING FROM
THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE.

I HEARD YOUR MUSIC.
IT'S -- IT'S REALLY GREAT.

I THOUGHT YOUR ALBUM WAS
REALLY STRONG,

AND I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

ABOUT DOING AN ARTICLE
ON YOUR STUFF

AND YOUR UPCOMING ALBUM.
FOR REAL?

LET'S SET UP A TIME AND GET TOGETHER.
YOU INTERESTED?

MY ZODIAC SIGN, AQUARIUS,

IS AN, UH,
AN INTELLECTUAL AIR SIGN,

WHICH, ACCORDING
TO HOROSCOPES.COM,

IS SUPPOSED
TO ENCOURAGE US

TO REBEL AGAINST
SOCIAL INJUSTICES

AND SEEK FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
IN OUR LIVES.

IF THAT IS THE CASE, SIGN ME UP
FOR THE AGE OF AQUARIUS.

DO I HAVE A DOLLAR?

I HAVE A DOLLAR.

"LINE IN NATURE
IS NOT FOUND."

"UNIT AND UNIVERSE
ARE ROUND.

"IN VAIN PRODUCED,
ALL RAYS RETURN.

"EVIL WILL BLESS,

"AS URIEL SPOKE

A SHUDDER RAN
AROUND THE SKY."

(airplane passes)

HERE.

TRY TO STAY WARM,
ALL RIGHT?

MAYBE WE'RE ASKING
THE WRONG QUESTIONS.

MAYBE THE QUESTION
SHOULD BE

WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY?

MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE AFRAID TO ACCEPT

RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE CONTROL
OUR OWN DESTINY.

WHETHER YOU BELIEVE
IN CHANCE, FREE WILL,

FATE, OR DESTINY,

SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOOK
INTO ANOTHER PERSON'S EYES...

YOU JUST KNOW.

IT'S ALL IN THE STARS.

I THINK THIS
IS YOURS.
