Emma!

<i>Can you survive... on faith alone?</i>

My sister! My sister!

<i>Oceanic flight 815 has crashed
somewhere in the South Pacific</i>

<i>Two groups of passengers survived.</i>

Let it out.

You are ok?
Where is my mom?

<i>Separated...</i>

<i>on different sides of the same island.</i>

You a doctor?

Clinical Psychologist.

Saved that girl's life...
You a doctor?

No.

Help!

Hey! I need some help!

Someone in the jungle!
Its alive!

Please help me!

Help!

What's your name?

Bernard.
You are gonna be alright, Bernard.

You couldnt find any matches?

Dry ones?

Will be dark soon.

Gonna get a signal fire
started so they can find us.

What are you, a boy scout?
I'm in the peace corps.

They still have that?

I'm just happy somebody your
age actually knows what it is.

I'm Ana Lucia.
Goodwin.

<i>The fight for survival will continue.</i>

<i>For on this island,
there are the survivors.</i>

<i>And... there are the Others.</i>

The Kids!
They took the kids!

They're gone.

What is that?
Its a list.

A list of what?

Of us.

Nothing?

They dragged nine
people into the jungle,

the kids,

and there's no sign of 'em?

Calm down.
Let's figure this out.

Here are the names of every
single person they took--

One of them had a list of us.

Maybe they're watching us.

Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know...

Anything.
Why would they try to...

...infiltrate us?
I mean, that's crazy.

Why do you think
they're doing this?

Why do I think
who's doing what?

Them.

Don't you ever wonder
why they attack us?

Maybe they're not attacking us.

Yeah, they just drag us into
the jungle every now and then.

No real harm done.

Can I ask you something?

Sure, Ana.

The day of the crash,

you ran out of the jungle

Ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.

You were never
even in the ocean.

Nathan...
Did you kill him?

Nathan was not a good person.

That's why he
wasn't on the list.

What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?

The children are fine.

They're better off now.

<i>The two camps of survivors
are unknown to each other.</i>

<i>and on the other side of the island,
the search for help is set to launch.</i>

<i>and this hope for rescue
rises along the shore...</i>

<i>Fellow survivors make an
extraordinary discovery...</i>

My god...

What is this thing?

How long have you known
about this?

Three weeks, give or take.

You've been out here for three weeks digging
this thing up, and you never told me about it.

All due respect, Jack, but
since when do I report to you?

All due respect, John,
but you lied.

So how do we open it?

What?

You want to open it?

Best case scenario, there's supplies.
Worst case, we use it as a shelter.

Actually, Jack I can think
of much worse cases than that.

I'm happy to say goodbye
to this place forever.

What about everybody else?
Think they'll be okay?

Hope so, buddy.

At least until we can
get them some help.

I need for you to explain to me what the hell's
going on inside your head, John.

I think that's why you and I don't
see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

Because you're a man of science.

Yeah. And what does that make you?

Me? Well, I'm a man of faith.

Do you really think all this
is an accident?

You think we crashed
on this place by coincidence?

Especially this place?

We were brought here for a purpose

And who brought us here, John?

The island.

It's destiny.
I dont believe in destiny.

Something's out there.

Kate, you run the fuse.

Jack and I will rig the charges.

How many do we need
to blow the hatch?

Two should take care of the hinge.

Three to be safe.

What are you folks
doing this far out here?

We were on a plane crash.
We've been on an island for a month, man!

It's a good thing we found you.

Yeah!

Only the thing is,
we're gonna have to take the boy.

What? What'd you say?

Just give us the boy.

Hey! What?

Sawyer!

Dad!
No!

Walt! No!

Dad!

Help Dad! Help me!

Dad! Help me Dad!

Please!

Walt!

<i>But on this island...</i>

<i>the greatest test of faith...</i>

<i>...lies deep beneath the surface.</i>

<i>Nobody can tell ya</i>

<i>there's only one song worth...</i>

<i>The lower the surface...</i>

<i>A confrontation...</i>

Do not move!

Oh! What did you do?

<i>Across the island...</i>

<i>a discovery...</i>

Libby...

<i>As two cane ups make first contact...</i>

Is he alive?

Get Ana Luc√≠a!
Quick!

You are gonna tell me
what's going on.

Just let me...
but you wanna get to work?

you're gonna tell me
how you got here.

It was three years ago.

I was on a solo race
around the world,

and my boat crashed into the reef,
and then Kelvin came.

Kelvin?

Kelvin. He comes
runnin' out the jungle.

"Hurry, hurry, come with me."

He brings me down here.

First thing he does,
'cause it's beepin' already,

he types in the code,
he pushes the button, and it stops.

"What was all that
about?" I say.

"Just savin' the
world," he says.

Saving the world?

Then Kelvin died,
and now here I am all alone.

The end.

You are alright, Mike?

It was my fault.

I never should have
brought him on the raft.

I'm gonna get him back.

I'm gonna get back my son.

How about that?

Current brought us back.

We're home.

Don't tell me you believe this.
This is crazy.

You think that makes sense,
pushing a button?

You're gonna take
his word for it?

His word is all we have, Jack.

You don't have to
take my word for it.

Watch the film.

What?

The bookcase, top shelf,
Projector's in the pantry.

Welcome. I'm Dr.
Marvin Candle,

and this is the
orientation film

for station 3 of the
Dharma Initiative.

You and your partner are currently
located in station 3-- or the swan--

and will be for
the next 540 days.

Every 108 minutes,
the button must be pushed.

From the moment
the alarm sounds,

you will have four
minutes to enter the code

into the
microcomputer processor.

When the alarm sounds, either you or
your partner must input the code.

do not attempt to use
the computer for any--

Congratulations, until
your replacements arrive,

the future of the
project is in your hands.

We're gonna need to
watch that again.

<i>Across the island...</i>

I'm Libby.
Michael.

We're here.

<i>Another hidden station provides refuge.</i>

Did you ever think that
maybe they put you down here

to push a button every hundred
minutes just to see if you would--

that all of this--
the computer, the button--

it's just a mind game,
an experiment?

Every single day.

Hey, man...

It's okay. Sun?

You'll be with her again. Soon.

All right, all of you, get up.

We're moving out.

Moving out where?

Back to where you came from.

He pushed that button
every 108 minutes?

He did indeed.

And what happens
if we don't push it?

We're not going to find
out. I'm setting up a system.

I'm still working on it, but
it looks like it's going to be

2-person shifts every 6 hours or so.

shifts?

Pushing a button?

Hey.

Hey.

You, um, you took a shower.

I had to see if it worked.

How was it?

smelled a little bit
like sulfur, but

it was a shower.

Yeah. I know what you mean.

You could use one.

Maybe a little later.

I'll leave the shampoo for you.

Im fine.

Shut up.

If he talks he's gonna
get us all killed.

What happened to you people?

They came the first night...

they took three of us.

Then they came back
and took nine more.

They're smart,

and they're animals.

And they could be
anywhere at any time.

Now we're moving
through the jungle--

their jungle--

And if you think that one gun and
one bullet is gonna stop them,

think again.

They took my son.

They took a lot of things.

You hooked it.

Try keeping your
left arm straight.

So you think you
could do better?

Anyone can hit a ball.
That's not golf.

And what's golf?

Golf is accuracy.

Well, why don't we
play a few holes

and see which one of
us is more accurate?

<i>The journey across the island,
nears its end.</i>

Hey, hey.

Sawyer.

Got it.

You may wanna move.

What?

Where is the doctor?

I got him.

Is he okay?
-To the bathroom.

He's burning up.
Gotta get him in the shower.

and bring his fever down.

<i>Two camps...
separated...</i>

<i>now finally....
reunited.</i>

Hello.
Hello.

Swallow....
Swallow, swallow.

Here, I'll do it.

No, no. I got it.
I can do it.

Sawyer...

It's Kate.

You need to listen to me, okay?

The only way that you are gonna get
better is if you take this pill.

Swallow.

Swallow.

Ok.
Nice job.

Never learned the whole
whisper-in-the-ear thing in med school.

<i>You are confused...</i>

Im sorry.
Are you?

<i>...and afraid.</i>

Yeah. Im sorry.

What's going on with you?
Just forget it.

No, no, dont walk away from me, no.
Let me go! Don't!

<i>So, where do you turn?</i>

Its ok. Its ok.

<i>You listen to your head...</i>

Its alright. Its alright.

<i>or you follow your heart?</i>

Is this washer and dryer newer
than everything else in here?

It washes clothes.
That's all I need to know.

Ah, finally.
Someone who keeps it simple.

Oh, hey, look at this.

You think I can pull this off?

Uh?

Turn aroud. I wanna try it on.
Around.

Oh. Oh, sure, yeah. Go ahead.
No peeking.

Okay, turn around.

What do you think?
It's awesome.

Thanks.

What are you writing?

Things I need to remember.

So you're Eko, huh?

Yes.

Claire.

And this is Aaron.

Aaron?

The brother of Moses?

Yeah, that must have been
tough to live up to, right?

Pressure of everyone saying,

"why can't you be more
like your brother Moses?"

Yes, I'm sure it was.

<i>A father...</i>

<i>...separated from his son.</i>

<i>A call for help...</i>

Locke?

<i>An act of desperation...</i>

John...

Stay in there. Stay--
Michael!

I'm going after my son,
and nobody is going to stop me, okay?

Okay? That is my right.
That is a father's right.

We can do this together. Ok?

I have to do it alone.

I think we'd better head back.

What?

Just find the trail, John.
I've lost the trail.

You don't just lose a trail.

Yeah, that's right, Jack.

I've been running
through the jungle

toward the sound of gunfire
because I don't care about Michael.

You know what happens if we
just turn around and go back?

We're never gonna
see him again,

and that's gonna be on us--

You're exactly right, Jack!

But if I were you,

I'd listen to Mr. Locke.

Who are you?

He's the son of a bitch
who shot me on the raft.

Why don't you
point the gun down?

Probably be best if we just keep
our hands at our sides, gentlemen.

Where's Michael?

Dont worry about Michael.

He's not gonna find us.

You took Walt.

Walt's fine.

Very special boy.

Tell me, you go over a man's
house for the first time,

you walk in the kitchen and eat
food that doesn't belong to you,

open the door to rooms you
got no business opening?

This is not your island.

This is our island.

And the only reason
you're living on it

is 'cause we let
you live on it.

I don't believe you.

I  think you've got one
guy up there with a gun.

I think there's more of
us than there are of you.

It's an interesting theory.

Light 'em up!

We got a
misunderstanding, Jack...

So listen carefully.

Right here there's a line.

You cross that line,
we go from misunderstanding to...

something else.

Now give me your weapons, turn around.
Go home.

No.

Jack, maybe--
No!

I hoped it wouldn't
come to this.

Bring her out, Alex!

She was following you.

Dont.

You and me ain't done, Zeke.

Jack, I...

You all right?
Yeah.

<i>A new day dawns...</i>

<i>and the same thread remains.</i>

Is it true that you
killed one of them?

Sayid tells me
that you're a cop.

I was a cop.

May I ask you something?

Shoot.

How long do you think it
would take to train an army?

<i>And this conflict with the Others
grows closer...</i>

<i>Some questions...</i>

We are here.

<i>May be answered.</i>

Over Here!

Help me!

Dont believe a word he says.

Help!

It's one of them.

My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota.

He's lying.

Please.
I'm going to cut him down.

You're making a
serious mistake.

Wait!

Minnesota, huh?
That's the question, isn't it?

Who are you?
Henry. Henry Gale.

How did you get to this island?

We crashed, my wife and I.

Crashed in what?
A balloon.

We were trying to
cross the Pacific.

She died.
she got sick three weeks ago.

What the hell is going on here?

Rousseau trapped
him in the jungle.

She believe he's an other.

You let Jack treat him first,
then we'll get our answers.

I think he's pretty convincing.

The real problem
is there's no way

we can be sure he's
telling the truth.

That is not necessarily true.

Sayid!

Hey, what the hell you doin'?

Sayid!
What needs to be done.

Why isn't this
combination working, John?

Did you change it?

Yeah.

Why would you do that?

Tell me who you are!

Sayid!

Sayid!

Jack.

Open it. Open it now.

Open that damn door, you understand me?!
You open it now!

No.

You want to push the button?
Open the door.

<i>When its all on the line...</i>

<i>where do you stand?</i>

You wouldn't.
What? I wouldn't what?

If we don't...
you would risk everyone's lives?

I don't think anything's gonna
happen when we get down to zero.

Jack...
You want to see what's gonna happen?

Let's just see
what's gonna happen.

<i>Do you listen to reason?</i>

<i>or at life?</i>

That's enough!

<i>How do you know...</i>

What are we doing, Jack?

What are we doing?

We can't hide him
down here forever.

No, just..

I want to know what
the long-term plan is.

Well, John,
let me ask you this--

we don't have a long-term
plan for the button,

but we keep pushing it,
don't we?

No cheeseburgers, huh?
No cheeseburgers.

Bon app√©tit.

I just don't understand why you
let the doctor call the shots.

No one calls the shots.

Jack and I make
decisions together.

Right. Okay.

Morning, Jack.

You couldn't wait 'til
I was done in here?

The steam opens up my pores.

I also thought this might be
a good time to talk about our problem.

Our problem?
Our Henry problem.

I think we need to bring in
some new blood.

Obviously, you have someone in mind.

What do you think about Ana Lucia?

I'll talk to her.

I already did.

In there with him now.

Where did Sawyer
find one of these anyway?

I mean, who flies
with a pregnancy test, right?

Have you ever taken one?

Yeah.

You're pregnant.

Sayid.

Can I talk to you?

Of course.

Alone?

Whatever you need to say
you can say it here.

It's about the hatch.
You mean the guy locked in the closet there?

What about him?

It's to his balloon.

How did you get him to do this?

I asked nicely.

This is at least a day's walk.

Then we should get going.

These tests are pretty accurate.

But it's impossible.

Oh no,  it's possible.

Congratulations, Sun.

I'm going to get back to the hatch.

You've been down there a lot, Jack.

Is everything okay?

Sure.

Yeah. Everything is fine.

That cliff there appears to be this.

Score one for Henry.

Pointing out
a geographical touchstone

does not mean
he's leading us to a balloon.

Maybe not, but at least
we're on the right island.

This must be my reward
for good behavior, huh?

I guess I earned myself some good will
for finally drawing that map for Ana.

What map?

To my balloon.

Did you...
No.

Wow, you guys have some real
trust issues, don't you?

Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you.

I mean, with the two of you
fighting all the time.

Of course,
if I was one of them --

these people that you
seem to think are your enemies --

I'd draw a map to a real secluded place

good place for a trap

And when your friends got there a bunch
of my people would be waiting for them.

Then they'd use them to trade for me.

I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

You guys got any milk?

Easy.

That's good. Ok, one more.

Uh, Sawyer, when you were
over there across the island,

how well did you get
to know those tailies?

Well enough, why?

That Libby chick
seems pretty cool.

I mean, is she?

Whoa, you got a little love
connection brewin' over there, Jabba?

No, just askin'.
Yeah, I hear you askin'.

Forget it.

<i>What do you do when your faith
is put to the test?</i>

<i>four...</i>

<i>three...</i>

<i>two...</i>

<i>one...</i>

What happened?

Hurley. You seen Ana Lucia?

She took off into the jungle with
Charlie and Sayid yesterday.

They say anything about
where they were going?

That would, like, assume that
anyone actually tells me anything.

Maybe, if I were in the loop,
I could be more helpful.

There is no loop, Hurley.

Lets go.

<i>Trapped in the hatch...</i>

<i>...and no way out.</i>

Harder!

<i>Who do you trust?</i>

The toolbox. Get the toolbox.

Come on! Come on! Put it under.

John, John, wait. Don't you think--

All right. We'll wait till
somebody comes. All right?

No, we don't have time.

That button has to be pushed.

Over here! This way!

He said he buried her, right?

Why isn't it raining here?

Henry!

<i>In crisis...</i>

<i>...comes discovery.</i>

<i>but where does it all lead?</i>

Hey, Jack.

You heading back to the hatch?
Yeah.

Mind if I join?

Been a while since I had a shower,
and I was just hoping that--

Actually, the--
the plumbing's busted.

Do you see that?
Yeah.

Its a parachute.

Wait!

What'd you find?

I did what you told me to.

I punched in the code and
pressed the execute button, but

nothing happened.

Get away from him!
Wait. You don't--

Step back right now.

I said get away!
It's all right.

Couldn't you find my balloon?

We did find your balloon, Henry Gale.

We also found the grave you described--

Still I did not
believe it to be true.

So I dug up that grave,

and found that there was not a
woman inside. There was a man.

A man named Henry Gale.

Sorry.

Good.

How you holding up?
Depends on Jack's best guess.

There's a small fracture.

How long until I can walk?

You're gonna have to keep
off it a couple of weeks.

Come on, you're doing great.
You know, exercise is addictive.

I can't see why.

Guess I need to
drop a few pounds.

Don't be so hard on yourself.

Some people's metabolisms
are just a little slower.

It's not my metabolism.

I'm sick.

When we first crashed here,
I thought this isn't all bad.

It's like the all-mango diet.

I wasn't turning any
heads or nothing, but

I did drop a
couple belt sizes.

Then we found this hatch,

and it was full of food...

tons of food.

You want to change?
Then change.

They found something! Come on!

How many of you are there?

If I told you about them,
you have no idea what he'll do.

He?
He mean their leader.

The guy with the beard?

He's no one. Nothing!

Hey.

How many of you are there?

He'll kill me!
I'll kill you!

You can't do this!
I am not a bad person!

What the hell's wrong with you?

What's going on?!
I heard a gunshot!

Jack!
I've got it covered, John.

I saw it first.
You are stealing my stuff!

You guys are like locusts.
How about a little order here?

I'm sure everyone can manage
to just take what they need.

Great plan, moonbeam.

After that, we can sing "kumbaya"
and do trust falls.

So, Henry...

I was thinking about
something you were saying

You were saying that
if you were one of them,

that you'd lead
us into a trap...

capture our people...

force a trade.

Us, for you.

Pretty good idea, Henry.

I'm going out to the line that
we're not supposed to cross

and telling them
that we've got you.

And if they want you back,
its gonna cost 'em.

And when we get Walt back...

You might just have been
worth all the trouble.

They'll never give you Walt.

I'm flattered.

Yeah? Why is that?

'Cause you chose me to go
with you instead of Sawyer.

I only asked you
because they don't want you.

They grabbed you,
had you at gunpoint.

They could have kept you,
but they didn't.

Then again,
they didn't really want me, either.

Damaged goods.
Both of us.

Its a doll.

Wait, wait, no-- no, don't--

You okay?
Yeah.

Oh, good. So you can hear me.

What are you doing?
I'm trying to get the gun.

I can't get my arm around.
All right, here, let me.

Ok.
Got it, got it, got it.

Nice shot.

You're in my spot.

I can move.

Can you?

Oh, that's funny.

I guess your sense of humor got
trapped under that door with your leg.

So what are you doing
down here, John?

I'm done with the hatch.

Oh, now,
you're just frustrated.

You'll be out of that splint and running
around the island again in no time.

And yet Jack said it'd
be at least four weeks.

But, honey, you and I both know
it's not gonna take that long.

<i>Can you survive on faith alone?</i>

We are here.

Right there is where I...

where I laid my gun down.

<i>Or you take matters
into your own hands...</i>

Hey!

You hear me?

<i>to right what is wrong?</i>

We've got your man!

<i>What would you do?</i>

If you want him back,
you're gonna have to come out here!

Come on out!
Jack!

I know you're out there!
I know you can hear me!

Jack, they're not here.

I'll be right here
until you talk to me!

I'll be right here!

How long are you
gonna wait, Jack?

Till I get my voice back.

Then I'm gonna yell some more.

I'm sorry I kissed you.

I'm not.

Michael.
