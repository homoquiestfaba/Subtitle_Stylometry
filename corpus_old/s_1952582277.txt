         - Ela vem.        

    - Ela não vem.         

Eu estava a espera desta menina
Eu conhecia no Tantra para ir a um encontro.

     Ela tem um pouco de medo
 Ou algo assim, um pouco nervosa
,

         Não compareceu.        

      Ela não responde.      


        - Estou chateado.       

      Eu arranjei estas flores,
       cortei o cabelo.        

46 
  Eu queria sair com ela. 

47 
  E depois ... Ela não veio. 

48 
    - VAMOS AGORA. 
SE Quiseres, Vem COM agente. 

49 
    Como - como você pode vir 
  Comer com agente, não há problema. 

50 
      - É um golpe para mim, 
      Você sabe o que significa? 

51 
  É - é como se eu fosse um pontapé 
         No estômago. 


54 
            - ELOGIOS. 
    - Basta dizer, filho. 

55

         FELIZ ANIVERSÁRIO! 

56 
OBRIGADO pela hospitalidade.

Então, eu queria convida-lo 
        Para jantar, 

59 
    E eu queria que Ron e SAM 
            Viessem,

  HEY, E OBRIGADO POR gostarem

69 
    Você sabe, como, honestamente, 
        Você sabe, como - 

70 
      Eu aprecio isso, meu

71 
  - Infelizmente, sinto-me melhor 
        Depois de disser ao JOSE 

72 
 acerca de mim de ter dormido 
         com o vinny, 

73 
      Acho que ele ficou chateado. 

76 
Eu realmente não acho que preciso 
    De dizer nada a ninguém. 

77 
        - Eu tenho meu desejo. 
        - AWW! OBRIGADO. 

78 
         Eu tenho meu desejo. 

79 
     - Eu vou á casa de banho 
            - Eu também. 

80 
      - Oh, sim. Ah, sim. 
        - Oh, sim. 

81 
        - Oh, sim. 
        - Oh, sim. 

82 
      - olha isso por mim? 

83 
     - Você sabe, nós não - 
    Não estamos juntos, 

86 
             - Sim. 

87 
    - Você sabe, é - 
      NÃO é um grande negócio, 

88 
      MAS AO MESMO TEMPO, 
Ela está dizendo a mim, você sabe, 

89 
     NÃO SEJA ***** ***** 
        Com outras meninas, 

90 
        Então estou pensando, 
  "Ela está montando REGRAS SOBRE MIM, 

91 
    Então o que o ***** - " 
     - Ela disse isso para você? 

92 
        - Oh, sim, cara. 
Ela não me disse isso. 

93 
          - Oh, cara - 
     - Ela não disse isso. 

94 
      Saltou essa parte 
          Da história. 

95 
 - O quê? Sim, claro, bro. 

96 
Ela passou de CAPÍTULO PRIMEIRO 
        Para o capítulo três. 

97 
  - Vem, cara. VOCÊ SABe ... 

98 
    Esta não é minha PRIMEIRA VEZ 
     Em torno do bloco, cara. 

99 
      Você sabe o que significa? 

100 
    Não é por nada, eu só - 
    Eu - eu apenas fiz o que ela - 

101 
    Sabe, o que era - 
cara, respeitando, VOCÊ sabe? 

102 
Respeitar uns aos outros, mas ... 

103 
**** cara, você sabe? 
    Não estamos juntos. 

104 
    - JOSE é definitivamente 
         está a jogar. 

105 
          Como um piano. 
           
107 
     - Meu favorito é ... 
             - Tchau! 

108 
  Agora vamos a pé para casa. 
          feliz aniversário. 

109 
          - Oh, meu Deus. 

110 
             - Sim. 

111 
Angelina, ela é minha ... amiga, 

112 
  Mas eu não confio que menina. 

113 
     Ela apenas diz uma coisa 
      MAS vai fazer outra. 

114 
        - Ei, ei, ei.   

116 
      - HEY bem vindos de volta. 

117 
    - Quando eu voltei, 
    Vinny estava chateado. 

118 
  Eu odeio ver o VINNY chatiado, 
        Eu realmente odeio, 

119 
Ele é como um irmão mais novo 
             PARA MIM. 

120 
 Yo, eu NÃO ACREDITO que aquela miúda 
     Realmente fez isso, como, 

121 
   PORQUE que ELA - POR 
  Que ela diria que ela vai GO 

122 
  E NÃO - Isso é loucura, LIKE 
 Por que você não ser real? 

123 
        LIKE, NADA. 
            - Eu sei. 

124 
Assim que eu tenho o telefone, 
            Eu sou assim, 

125 
      Há provavelmente LIKE 
Uma possibilidade de 85% do seu não vir. 

126 
         - High five TI. 

127 
            - OLÁ! 
 - Oh, o UP? Como foi o jantar? 

128 
             - Bom. 
         - Foi bom. 

129 
      Como foi seu jantar? 
      - Bom. Foi bom. 

130 
            - Sério? 

131 
    - Você está bem, mano? 
        - Sim, eu estou bem. 

132 
    - Vinny, VOCÊ SABE, 
        Ele vai CRAZY. 

133 
  Ele é como, "[bleep], eu olho, 
         LIKE, retardado. 

134 
    "Eu fui e tenho flores, 
         Cortou o cabelo, 

135 
MADE reservas para o jantar. " 

136 
  Eu tenho que ir na sala Smush 
          Por um segundo. 

137 
     E me sinto mal por ele. 

138 
Então, hum, eu, uh, DINHEIRO VINNY Esquerda, 

139 
  E eu dei as flores para SAM 
    VINNY QUE COMPRARAM. 

140 
     - Yo, o que começou. 

141 
          - [Rindo] 

142 
     - OLHA O QUE VOCÊ TEM. 

143 
      OLHE O QUE ELE TEM QUE. 

144 
     - Estes não são para mim. 

145 
        - Só Deus sabe 
        QUE sobre estes, 

146 
Porque eles foram APENAS na cama 
        Por três horas. 

147 
  Você tem meu CRIANÇAS lá, 
        CRIANÇAS Mike. 

148 
      YOU GOT SUCO Snooki. 

149 
Você não distingui-los 
            VOCÊ MESMO.

    - Eu ainda pago por eles. 
             - AWW! 

151

              BRO. 

152 
        - Não importa. 
     Eu paguei por eles. - NÃO. 

153 
  - Honestamente, eu estava apenas sendo 
 Um burro, para ser honesto com você. 

154 
    TI realmente não - 
 Eu não lhe deu as flores. 

155 
        - Adeus, boa noite. 
          - Boa noite. 

156 
      - Venha aqui. 
        VAMOS PARA A CAMA. 

157 
    - TER UM GRANDE DIA. 
    - Obrigado, querida. 

158 
  - ONDE VOCÊ QUER DORMIR 
        AGORA? 

159 
Querida, onde você quiser. 

160 
Eu pensei que estávamos indo dormir 
    NA SALA, 

161 
 MAS SE VOCÊ NÃO QUERO DORMIR 
 Lá, vamos dormir na sua cama. 

162 
  - JOSE definitivamente queria, UH, 
          ANIVERSÁRIO DO SEXO. 

163 
            [Risos] 

164 
SO UM, como ele era, "Let's Stay 
NA SALA DE HOJE Smush ". 

165 
     Eu era como, "OK, tudo bem." 
         SO ... VOCÊ SABE. 

166 
    Eu definitivamente não acho que 
    Esta cama é, LIKE 

167 
        BOM para dormir. 

168 
Eu só precisava ter a certeza 
 SALA o maldito não estava sujo. 

169 
Você não acha que é, como, 
             Encardido, 

170 
LIKE, dormir nesta cama

     - Tudo bem, Just Go - 

172 
  Basta colocar - meter por cima. 
    Eu já volto. 

173 
         INFELIZMENTE, 
    Eu estava realmente cansado. 

174 
  VOCÊ SABIA? SIMILAR - Além disso, era 
 QUE TIME DO MÊS PARA MIM. 

175 
        [Tosse] 

176 
Mas, quero dizer, não me interpretem mal, 

177 
      Eu sinto que o miúdo 
    Realmente atraente, 

178 
      ELE é o meu tipo de cara, 
    Mas eu sou a mulher, 

179 
Então eu escolher e escolher QUANDO EU QUERO 
     Ter relações sexuais com um cara. 

180 
        [Pigarro] 

181 
             [Suspira] 

182 
SEXO NO ANIVERSÁRIO DE JOSÉ, desculpe.

190 
 Lamento que não poderia ir CRAZY, 
             MAS ... 

191 
          - Eu me diverti. 

192 
  - Eu não estou apaixonada por JOSE. 

193 
    Eu estou gostando da KID 

194 
    Mas eu não iria tão longe 
         COMO DIZER AMOR. 

195 
          - Uh, ANGE ... 

196 
      Tudo bem, garota? 
            - Cansado.

206 
    - Pelo menos ele tem isso em.

        - Eles fizeram. 

208 
      Ela admitiu JOSE

211 
          - E sabia 
 Que se ele fosse para casa com ela,

    Na noite anterior - 

214 
  - E ELE NÃO DÊ A [bleep]

Sim. Então ele foi, "eu sou 
Definitivamente ficando traseiros esta noite. " 

216 
        - Exatamente. 
Ele só quer Get It In. 

217 
    - Se ele teria se importado

    IN LIKE 20 MINUTES

  - I RAN-- I RAN INTO A HOUSE. 

    I WAS LIKE-- BOOM!          

     I WAS LIKE, "MY COOKA!"    
     - HOW PAINFUL IS THAT?

    SO I TAKE MY GIRL,          
     I RUN THROUGH THE CLUB,    

        AND I TRY TO RUN        
    INTO THE BATHROOM.          

        - ANGELINA,             
     YOU DIDN'T GET [bleep]?    

         - NO, [bleep].         

SO, WHAT'D YOU DO, THEN?      

            - DANCE,            
LIKE A [bleep] HUMAN BEING.     

    - OH, SO YOU DANCED         
    WITH SNOOKI'S GUY?          

      - NO, I DIDN'T DANCE      
    WITH SNOOKI'S GUY.          

              - OH!             

    - [Jenni laughing]          

            ¶ ¶                 

WE'RE AT DREAM RIGHT NOW,     
AND I GOT A BEAUTIFUL GIRL HERE,

     AND SHE'S READY TO GO.     

    THIS GIRL IS READY.         

         SHE WAS SO DTF.        

    SO I TAKE MY GIRL,          
     I RUN THROUGH THE CLUB,    

        AND I TRY TO RUN        
    INTO THE BATHROOM.          

        - [laughs]              
    - LOCK IT! LOCK IT!         

      - [knocking on door]      

 YO! ONE PERSON IN THE BATHROOM 
        AT A TIME.              

        ONE PERSON!             

 - AND I GUESS SECURITY ENDED UP
 KNOCKING ON THE DOOR, WHATEVER.

    MY PLAN WAS FOILED.         

SO I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,      
    I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?    

I'M LIKE, "I WANT TO LEAVE NOW."

     SO, WE'RE ABOUT TO WALK    
          OUT OF HERE,          

  AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW...  

        I LOSE HER.             
IT WAS CROWDED OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

        WHATEVER IT WAS.        

     THE CLUB IS CLOSED NOW.    

YOU CAN'T EVEN-- YOU'RE NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO GO BACK IN THE CLUB.

  AND NOW I DON'T HAVE MY GIRL. 

         I'M SO PISSED.         

        I DIDN'T EVEN GET       
        MY GIRL'S NUMBER.       

 - WE DIDN'T BRING ANYBODY HOME 
            TONIGHT.            

I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT HOME      
          NICOLE'S MAN.         

          - [laughing]          

      - WHAT A GOOD NIGHT.      

        [laughing]              

             - I...             

  - I HAD SO MUCH FUN WITH YOU  
            TONIGHT.            

      - I'VE, LIKE, FALLEN      
 BACK IN LOVE WITH YOU, LIKE... 

        - SO DID I.             
            - AND...            

I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD.      
    I DON'T KNOW THAT I DID.    

          - IT'S GREAT,         
    BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.         

    YOU KNOW, I THINK THINGS    
    ARE PICKING UP BETWEEN US   

  AND THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER 

    AS THE DAYS GO ON,          
        THE WEEKS GO ON,        

AND THEN IT'S LIKE WE'RE FINDING
  THE LOVE WE FOUND IN JERSEY.  

        - NO, SERIOUSLY.        
  DID YOU GET [bleep] TONIGHT?  

 - YOU GUYS ARE BEING RETARDED, 
        SERIOUSLY.              

             - WHAT?            
          - IF I WAS...         

  - THEY'RE TRYING TO INSTIGATE 
            PROBLEMS.           

 I DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO THAT KID 
        LIKE THAT.              

 - I JUST CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT.
    YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?   

         SHE GOT [bleep]        
    ON THE DANCE FLOOR.         

     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?     

    - SHE GOT [bleep].          
    - YEAH, OK. I GOT--         

        - ANGELINA,             
     YOU DIDN'T GET [bleep]?    

         - NO, [bleep]!         
    - SO WHAT'D YOU DO, THEN?   

            - DANCE,            
LIKE A [bleep] HUMAN BEING.     

      - NO, I DIDN'T DANCE      
    WITH SNOOKI'S GUY.          

              - OH!             
              - OH!             

    - WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?    

     YOU JUST TALKED TO HIM?    
YOU DIDN'T DANCE WITH HIM?      

    - UM, I WAS TALKING         
    TO ANOTHER KID, ACTUALLY.   

 - SO YOU DIDN'T DANCE WITH HIM?

 'CAUSE I'M JUST SAYING, 'CAUSE 
  IT'S [bleep] 5 MILLION PEOPLE 

  THAT SEEN YOU DANCE WITH HIM  
            TONIGHT.            

 - HE WAS DANCING ON THIS SIDE. 
 I WAS DANCING WITH MY FRIENDS. 

 - SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

    DUDE [bleep] SNOOKI         
      AND DANCES WITH YOU,      

    BUT YOU WAS DANCING         
    ON THE SIDE OF HIM.         

        I'M JUST SAYIN'.        

  - PAULY, I NEVER KNEW YOU HAD 
        SUCH A BIG MOUTH.       

    - IF YOU WANT ME TO MIND    
MY BUSINESS, JUST TELL ME.      

  - MIND YOUR [bleep] BUSINESS. 

    - I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET   
          AN INFECTION.         

         - [Mike laughs]        

            ¶ ¶                 

[record scratching to halt]     

    - [Jenni laughing]          

      NICOLE IS PISS-DRUNK      

WHILE ME AND TOM WERE TRYING TO,
        UH, YEAH...             

      AND SHE ACTUALLY GOES     
      UNDERNEATH THE COVERS     

  AND GRABS ME AND TOM'S FOOT.  

        - LOVE YOU!             

        - [Jenni laughs]        

      I JUST FELT SOMETHING     
          GRAB MY LEG.          

            - SORRYS!           

          - IT WAS LIKE         
    THE PUPPY DOG SHAME FACE,   

        LIKE, "OH MY GOD,       
         I DIDN'T KNOW,"        

        AND SHE RAN OFF.        

             - MEH!             

            [laughs]            

  - "SAMANTHA. WE MET AT A CLUB 
     LAST NIGHT. MY NUMBER."    

          - [laughing]          

 - JUST SHUT THE [bleep] UP NOW!

YOU SHUT THE [bleep] UP!      

      - GET OUT OF MY FACE.     

             - WHOA!            

            ¶ ¶                 

        - YOU GUYS READY?       
          - I'M READY.          

            - READY?!           

  OH, YEAH. GYM, LAUNDRY. YEAH. 

    - I WAKE UP EARLY.          
      THE HOUSE IS A MESS.      

        IT'S DISGUSTING.        

I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING WITH     
A BUNCH OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW,     

          ZOO ANIMALS.          

    THIS [bleep] HOUSE.         
          ANOTHER MESS.         

DISHES ARE ALWAYS PILED UP.     

    IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT   
  WHERE IT'S LIKE OVERWHELMING. 

        IT'S JUST GROSS.        

         [phone ringing]        

             HELLO?             

     - HEY. I'M AT THE POOL.    
        WHAT'S UP?              

  - I'M JUST CLEANING THE HOUSE 
          A LITTLE BIT          

 'CAUSE IT'S A [bleep] DISASTER.

  YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH?  

             - YEAH.            
 - ALL RIGHT, SO COME HERE NOW. 

        - ALL RIGHT. BYE.       
             - BYE.             

         - LOOKING GOOD!        

         - WHAT A CHEST.        

     - IF I DIDN'T DO MY GTL    
     OR TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,    

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D LOOK LIKE.

IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE GYM,     
      YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.      

 IF YOU DON'T TAN, YOU'RE PALE. 

  AND IF YOU DON'T DO LAUNDRY,  
    YOU AIN'T GOT NO CLOTHES.   

    I WROTE DOWN "SITUATION."   

     IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.    
         LET'S FIND IT.         

HOW DO YOU SAY "CLOTHES"      
        IN SPANISH?             

             <i>- ROPA.</i>            
         <i>- NO ROPA.</i>             

 <i>- NO ROPA PARA SITUATION.</i>      

 <i>- NO ROPA PARA SITUATION.</i>      
           <i>- NO BUENO!</i>          

     - NO, I NO SEE NOTHING.    

    - <i>NO BUENO.</i> I GOT--         
 REMEMBER I CAME IN, I CAME IN, 

    I GOT [unclear] WITH YOU.   

 - NO, NOT WITH ME. NOT WITH ME.
        - REMEMBER?             

            OHH, NO!            
    - OHH, A SITUATION!         

         - YOU REMEMBER         
     YOU PICK UP YESTERDAY?     

    - I PICKED UP YESTERDAY?    

         - YEAH, HONEY,         
    YOU PICKED UP YESTERDAY.    

 I WAS HERE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

      REMEMBER, SITUATION?      

    - OH, OK, OK. OK, OK, OK.   
              - OK?             

    - MY BAD. [laughs]          

        I CAME BACK             
     FROM MY WHOLE GTL GAME,    

AND ON THE FRONT DOOR I SEE     
    A NICE LITTLE NOTE.         

  - "SAMANTHA. WE MET AT A CLUB 
     LAST NIGHT. MY NUMBER."    

    - [Pauly laughing]          

     - OH, THAT'S MY CHICK.     
             - HUH?             

    - THAT'S MY CHICK.          
        - all: OH.              

 - I THOUGHT IT WAS TO SAMANTHA.
              - NO.             

  - I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR SAMMI, 

     LIKE SOME GUY WROTE IT     
        FOR SAMMI.              

        - NO, IT'S MINE.        

THIS IS THE SAME CHICK I HAD MET
  THE NIGHT BEFORE AT THE CLUB. 

AND I HAD TO LEAVE, AND I     
 DIDN'T GET THIS CHICK'S NUMBER.

BUT, UH... I GUESS SHE FOUND ME.

     WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CHICK.    

     I WAS TALKING ABOUT HER    
    ALL DAY TODAY TOO.          

 THE NOTE SAYS, LIKE, "SAMANTHA"
    AND HAS HER NUMBER,         

     AND IT SAYS "CALL ME."     

        NOW, IF I WANTED        
    TO DECIPHER THAT FOR YOU,   

      IT PRETTY MUCH SAYS,      
    "HERE'S MY NUMBER.          

         PLEASE CALL ME         
SO WE CAN BANG REAL QUICK."     

EVERYTHING'S GOING SMOOTH     
      FOR RONNIE AND SAMMI,     

      AND, UM, IT'S BORING,     

    SO I NEED TO CREATE         
        SOME EXCITEMENT.        

        [laughing]              

              - YO.             

[laughing] JUST KIDDING!      

      - OH MY GOD, [bleep].     

     - SOMEBODY WROTE THIS.     
      IT WAS ON THE THING.      

     IT'S FOR MIKE, THOUGH.     
    - OH. YOU'RE AN [bleep].    

         - LOOK AT THIS.        

        [laughing]              

     - HER NAME'S SAMANTHA?     
             - YEAH.            

  - OH, GOD, YOU'RE A [bleep].  

          - [laughing]          
         - HOLY [bleep].        

            - SEE YA.           
        - HAVE FUN.             

DON'T WANT TO BE NOWHERE      
            NEAR HER.           

ME AND PAULY DEFINITELY IS      
 A LITTLE DRAINED AT THIS POINT.

 I WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH, JUST
  WANT TO CHILL OUT AND RELAX.  

WHERE'S THE TOPLESS PART?     
      I WANT TO GO TOPLESS.     

 - LET'S GET SOME GUYS' NUMBERS 
          ON THE BEACH          

  AND INVITE THEM OUT TONIGHT.  

          - [laughing]          
 I WANT THAT KID'S NUMBER, LOOK.

        - WHO, WHO?             
         - RIGHT THERE.         

         - BUT, EW! EW.         
          - [laughing]          

OH, LOOK, THERE'S PAULY,      
             RIGHT?             

            - WHERE?            

YOU WANT TO GO OVER THERE     
             OR NO?             

            - EHH...            

    - I BASICALLY DIDN'T SAY    
  ANYTHING TO VINNY AND PAULY.  

  I'M WITH MY FRIEND RIGHT NOW. 

I DON'T WANT TO BE DISTURBED BY,
 YOU KNOW, IMMATURE LITTLE MEN. 

    SO I DECIDED TO HANG OUT    
         WITH MY FRIEND         

        AND NOT EVEN SAY        
        ONE WORD TO THEM        

    AND NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE    
      THAT THEY WERE THERE.     

 - ME AND VINNY, WE NOTICE THESE
  BEACHED WHALES ON THE BEACH.  

         [whale sounds]         

    OH NO, I'M SORRY, IT WAS    
  ANGELINA AND HER FRIEND GINA. 

    WE SEE THEM AT THE BEACH.   

    WE'RE NOT EVEN SAYING HI    
            TO THEM.            

     WE'RE LETTING THEM HAVE    
          THEIR SPACE.          

 ME AND VINNY JUST KIND OF DO US

 AND LET ANGELINA AND HER FRIEND
            DO THEM.            

      - ME AND PAULY, LIKE,     
  CAN HAVE FUN OUT OF NOTHING,  

      AND WHEN WE HANG OUT,     
         IT'S JUST LIKE,        

      IT'S JUST NO EFFORT.      

    WE JUST EASILY GET ALONG    
        WITH EACH OTHER.        

HE'S LIKE A BEST FRIEND OF MINE.

          - [laughing]          

    YOU LOOK MAD FUNNY.         

 WE HAD A GOOD TIME, HIM AND I. 
    WE MET SOME GIRLS.          

  AND THEN THEY, UM, HELPED ME  
     BURY VINNY IN THE SAND.    

WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU BOOBS.     

 - NO, BUT THESE ARE PRETTY BIG.
      I THINK YOU'RE A "B."     

     - OH, NICE BOOBS, BRO.     
     I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD.     

             - YEAH.            

     - CAN YOU GET OUT, BRO?    

      - all: OH! [laughing]     

    - WHERE'S MY TOWEL?         

    - OH, I BURIED IT.          

        - [both laughing]       

    - YOU CAN USE MINE.         

        - OH, YEAH.             

            OH, YEAH.           

          THIS-- THIS--         
    MY GIRL FROM LAST NIGHT?    

SHE CAME AND SHE LEFT IT      
          ON THE FENCE?         

        - SMOKIN' CHICK.        

  DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING 
            TONIGHT?            

    'CAUSE I'M GONNA TELL HER   
        TO COME WITH US.        

            - CLUTCH?

         - "HEY, BABY."         
              - HI.             

      - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?     
      - "WHAT ARE YOU DO--"     

    [laughs] EW! IF YOU EVER    
     TALKED LIKE THAT TO ME,    

I'D BE LIKE, "WHAT THE [bleep]?"

  - DO YOU-- DO YOU HAVE PLANS  
      OR SOMETHING TONIGHT?     

          - DO I HAVE--         
 NO, I DON'T HAVE PLANS TONIGHT.

SO YOU HAVE PLANS WITH ME NOW.

          - [laughing]          
     I HAVE PLANS WITH YOU.     

             - YEAH.            
          - [laughing]          

      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?      

      UH, WE'RE GOING TO GO

 - SHE'S SMOKIN'. SHE'S SMOKIN'.
    - EW! YOU'RE SO...          

UH, MY GIRL'S COMING OVER     
            TONIGHT,            

    AND THE HOUSE IS A MESS.    

    I'M TIRED OF CLEANING UP,   

        BUT I GOT TO MAKE       
  A GOOD IMPRESSION ON MY GIRL. 

         UH, AND I-- I--        
  THIS IS ALL THAT I'M LEAVING, 

AND I'M LEAVING IT FOR ANGELINA.

         I JUST CLEANED         
    THIS WHOLE HOUSE--          

            GARBAGE,            
THROWING EVERYTHING AWAY...     

 I'M DOING THIS, I'M DOING THAT,

          AND THEN I GO         
      INTO THE BATHROOM...      

    WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?   

    ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?    

            FOR REAL?           

      CAN I SHOW YOU THIS,      
  HOW DIRTY THIS TRASH BAG IS?  

  WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, IF YOU 
COULD HELP OUT WITH THE DISHES--

I CLEANED UP ALL MORNING.     

  - YOU KNOW, SHUT YOUR MOUTH,  
    YOU DIRTY LITTLE HAMSTER.   

      - GET OUT OF MY FACE.     

             - STOP!            
    - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!   

      - GET OUT OF MY FACE!     
    - COME ON, COME ON!         

        - I JUST CLEANED        
    THIS WHOLE HOUSE--          

            GARBAGE,            
THROWING EVERYTHING AWAY...     

         I'M DOING THIS,        
        I'M DOING THAT...       

          AND THEN I GO         
      INTO THE BATHROOM...      

            FOR REAL?           

 CAN I SHOW YOU THIS, HOW DIRTY 
THIS [bleep] TRASH BAG IS?      

          LOOK AT THIS.         

          WHAT IS THAT?         

 WHAT IS THIS THING RIGHT HERE? 
          WHAT IS THIS?         

        - EW! IT'S A PAD!       
          - OH, MY GOD.         

  - WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT? 

LIKE, LISTEN, GIRLS, I KNOW     
THAT THIS [bleep] HAPPENS.      

    I KNOW THAT EVERY MONTH,    
      THERE'S A SITUATION.      

          BUT AT LEAST          
      CLEAN THE [bleep] UP.     

OH, THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.      

     THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.     
THIS GRANNY PANTY [bleep].

    I [bleep] FLIP OUT.         

              - EW!

            ¶ ¶                 

 - WELL, BASICALLY, I SEE A GUY,
 LIKE, WALKING ALONG THE BEACH, 

        AND I JUST SAID,        
"HEY, YOU, COME OVER HERE."     

     AND HE CAME OVER TO ME,    
 AND HE WAS REALLY A SWEET GUY. 

     HE'S LIKE A CUTIE PIE.     
    - HE IS. HE'S A GOOD KID.   

      - HE'S HOT. [laughs]      

         AND, YOU KNOW,         
  WE INVITED HIM TO THE HOUSE.  

  I ALWAYS MEET THE NICE GUYS.  
            [laughs]            

    I THINK HIS NAME'S MIKE.    

        I THINK SO.             

      ¶ ROCK-A-BYE, BABY ¶      

¶ WELCOME TO NEW JACK CITY,     
  WHERE THE DRINKS ARE STRONG ¶ 

  ¶ AND THE GIRLS LOOK PRETTY ¶ 

          ¶ BUT SO BIG          
 THAT I CALL HER FRIEND NIDDY ¶ 

          - [laughing]          

 - SEE? WHY CAN'T WE WALK AROUND
        LIKE THAT?              

WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?     
            OCEAN'S?

          - YEAH, YEAH.         

              - AW!             

     - DID YOU? GOOD. GOOD.     

    - ANGELINA GIVES EVERYONE   
          IN THE HOUSE          

     A REASON TO GET ON HER,    

    'CAUSE SHE'S DIRTY          

    AND SHE DOESN'T CLEAN UP    
     AFTER HERSELF, PERIOD.     

      SO, IS IT GOING TO BE     
     ANOTHER FIGHTING NIGHT     

        OR A CHILL NIGHT?       

         - FIGHT NIGHT?         
 - ANOTHER FIGHT NIGHT TONIGHT. 

         - YOU THINK SO?        

     - I WONDER WHO'S HOME.     

        SOMEBODY CLEANED.       

YOU GUYS WANT TO PUT THIS     
         IN THE KITCHEN?        

     - UM, NO, COME. JUST...    

MIKE'S BED, PAULY'S BED, MY BED.

      [gasps] CHECK MY BED.     

         DID HE [bleep]         
    WITH MY BELONGINGS?         

         - YOU CHECK IT.        
        I HAVE TO GO PEE.       

            - HE DID.           

      HE [bleep] MY STUFF.      

I BASICALLY PICKED UP MY PILLOW,
    AND I SAW A USED PAD, UM,   

      YOU KNOW, ON MY BED.      

        IT'S ALWAYS MIKE.       

    HE'S ALWAYS PRANKING ME,    
 AND I'M SO [bleep] SICK OF IT. 

    - YO, THAT'S [bleep] UP.    
          WHO DID THAT?         

     I'M GOING TO THROW UP.     

  - I WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED, 
     BECAUSE I DID FEEL LIKE    

I DIDN'T KNOW THE NEW KID,      

    AND FOR HIM TO HAVE SEEN    
      SOMETHING LIKE THAT,      

  I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY LIKE, 

    "WOW. WHAT GOES ON          
         IN THIS HOUSE?"        

      - YO, WHO WOULD WANT      
         TO TOUCH THAT?         

    WHAT THE [bleep] IS WRONG   
        WITH THEM?              

I'LL JUST PICK IT UP AFTER,     
        YOU KNOW--              

 - NO, I'M THROWING IT OUT NOW. 
    IT'S MY [bleep] [bleep].    

 - NO, WITH A PLASTIC BAG JUST--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH IT.     

WHAT A [bleep] DOUCHEBAG      
        THAT [bleep] IS.        

          HIS [bleep]!          

    HE'S SUCH A [bleep], MAN.   
        I HATE HIM.             

    MIKE'S A [bleep] [bleep].   

        - OH, YEAH!             

 - I SHOULD JUST GO LOCK MYSELF 
     IN THE BATHROOM, SO...     

     - [both girls laughing]    

          - DOUCHEBAG.          

             [beep].            

      [gasps] CHECK MY BED.     

         DID HE [bleep]         
    WITH MY BELONGINGS?         

             HE DID.            

    MIKE'S A [bleep] [bleep].   

        - OH, YEAH!             

 THERE'S A TAMPON UNDER THE BED.

      IF YOU WEREN'T DIRTY,     
    YOU WOULDN'T GET A PRANK.   

    - DON'T EVEN SAY NOTHING    
            ABOUT IT.           

        'CAUSE IF YOU DO,       
      THEN IT'S GONNA GET--     

THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO,
              SO...             

     - OH NO, I DON'T CARE.     

        - WHAT'S UP, MAN?       
        WHAT'S YOUR NAME?       

        - MICHAEL.              
    - NICE TO MEET YOU.         

ARE YOU FRIENDS OR RELATED OR...
     - YEAH, HE'S MY FRIEND.    

    - WHERE DID YOU MEET HIM?   
         - ON THE BEACH.        

        - OH, COOL, COOL.       

 YOU KNOW ANGELINA BROUGHT HOME 
  ANOTHER DUDE FROM THE BEACH?  

WE REALLY HAVE TO STEP UP     
        OUR PIMPING GAME.       

            - I-- I--           
    - BECAUSE, LIKE...          

YOU KNOW, I BANG TWO-- SHE BANGS
    TWO GUYS IN THE SAME DAY.   

SHE'S GETTING DAYTIME DATES     
          IN THE HOUSE.         

  LIKE, YO, WE GOT TO STEP UP,  
              BRO.              

     - SHE BRINGS HOME A GUY    
        EVERY OTHER DAY--       

 - SHE'S LIKE A [bleep] MATINEE 
         DURING THE DAY.        

 - SHE'S GOT THE MATINEE, RIGHT?
     - SHE'S A MATINEE, YO.     

 - ANGE, WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, 
      IF YOU COULD HELP OUT     

  WITH THE DISHES WITH SOME OF  
  THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE 

     THAT DON'T DO ANYTHING.    

I CLEANED UP ALL MORNING,     
        BABY DOLL.              

            - REALLY?           
            - MM-HMM.           

    - ARE YOU FOR REAL?         

 'CAUSE I'M THE ONE THAT CLEANED
     THE WHOLE HOUSE TODAY.     

        - YOU CLEANED UP        
        EVERYTHING ELSE,        

 BUT I THREW AWAY GARBAGES, AND 
  I CLEANED UP A LOT OF STUFF-- 

        - GARBAGES?             
        - [clears throat]       

    - ARE YOU FOR REAL?         
        - I SWEAR TO GOD.       

WOULD YOU WANT TO WALK OUTSIDE

AND SEE HOW MANY TRASH BAGS     
    I FILLED UP TODAY?          

CAN YOU STOP STARTING WITH ME,
              MIKE?             

     'CAUSE I'VE [bleep] HAD    
     ENOUGH OF YOUR [bleep].    

YO, OH MY GOD, ANGELINA.      
             [bleep]            

         YOU KNOW WHAT,         
MAYBE IF YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE     

A [bleep] [bleep] TAMPON--      

          - IT <i>WAS</i> YOU.         
    - IN THE [bleep]--          

          - IT <i>WAS</i> YOU.         
IN THE BATHROOM ON THE FLOOR--

          YOU-- WHAT--          
IT WASN'T ON THE FLOOR, IDIOT.

 WHAT WORLD DO YOU LIVE IN WHERE
 THERE'S A [bleep] DIRTY TAMPON?

    YOU ARE THE DIRTIEST GIRL   
         I'VE EVER MET.         

      - I THINK IT'S GROSS      

  THAT ANGELINA LEAVES HER PADS 
        AROUND THE HOUSE.       

 SO FOR MIKE TO GET MAD AT THAT,

    YOU KNOW, I GOT HIS BACK    
        COMPLETELY.             

 - DON'T TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THIS
     IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS,    

 'CAUSE YOU'RE MAKING EVERYBODY 
          NOT LIKE YOU.         

I DON'T CARE WHO'S HERE.      

        THIS IS MY HOUSE.       
          I DON'T CARE.         

  - LEAVE ME THE [bleep] ALONE. 
    GET OUT OF MY FACE.         

     - YO, SHUT YOUR MOUTH,     
    YOU DIRTY LITTLE HAMSTER.   

YOU LOOK LIKE POPEYE ON CRACK.
  GET OUT OF MY FACE, JERKOFF.  

  - POPEYE ON CRACK. OH MY GOD. 

HOW MANY GUYS DID YOU SLEEP WITH
        IN 24 HOURS? TWO.       

     - NO, I DIDN'T HAVE SEX    
      WITH JOSE, YOU MORON.     

        - VINNY AND JOSE.       

    - CAN YOU TELL-- TELL HIM   
      TO GO [bleep] HIMSELF     

     AS MY FRIEND RIGHT NOW.    

        - 24-HOUR PERIOD,       
      YOU BANGED TWO GUYS.      

        - YO! MIKE, STOP.       
 - YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT?

YOU'RE GOOD AT BEING A HO.      

  - OH, WELL, YOU'RE A DIRTBAG, 
 AND YOUR PENIS SHOULD FALL OFF,

    'CAUSE YOU'RE DISGUSTING.   
    'CAUSE YOU'RE DISGUSTING.   

    - YEAH, ALL RIGHT.          
     - DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.     

HE'S [bleep] 'CAUSE YOU'RE      
    IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW.   

    - HE'S TRYING TO MAKE ME    
            LOOK BAD.           

  I DO WHAT I WANT IN MY LIFE.  

  THAT'S IT. I'M A SINGLE GIRL. 
        I DO WHAT I WANT.       

 I'M GLAD THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
        TO BE MY FRIEND,        

 AND YOU'RE TRYING TO EMBARRASS 
 ME IN FRONT OF MY REAL FRIENDS.

  - I'M NOT TRYING TO EMBARRASS 
    YOU IN FRONT OF ANYBODY.    

          - ALL RIGHT,          
  JUST SHUT THE [bleep] UP NOW! 

YOU SHUT THE [bleep] UP!      

      - GET OUT OF MY FACE.     

             - STOP!            
 - WHOA, WHOA! COME ON, COME ON!

      - GET OUT OF MY FACE,     
          YOU JERKOFF!          

     - HEY, BABY, WHAT'S UP?    
        COME ON IN.             

        GUESS WHAT?             

I'M ABOUT TO SMASH TONIGHT.     

             - OH!!             

    - YO, WHAT IS THAT?         

      IS THAT HER SCREAMING     
        HAVING SEX?             

THAT'S THE SOUND OF LOVE.     

    - AND <i>I'M</i> A WHORE.          

             - ALEX!            
     YOU HOOKED UP WITH HER?    

         - NO, I DIDN'T.        

     - YOU DEFINITELY, LIKE,    
    HOOKED UP WITH HER.         

     SNOOKI HAS THE AUDACITY    
    TO WALK IN THE DOOR         

     HOLDING MY GUY'S HAND.     

  - AFTER I HAD SEX WITH VINNY, 
     YOU HAD SEX WITH VINNY.    

         - I DON'T WANT         
      YOUR SLOPPY SECONDS.      

HOLD MY EARRINGS, PLEASE.     

  - OH YEAH, THIS IS WHAT'S UP.
