Hey, I'm on my way.
I'm so late. I'm sorry.

Say that again.
You're breaking up.

Say it again.

Are you there?
Are you there?

Damn it.

[horn honking]

[brakes screeching]

[crashing sound,
glass breaking]

[monitor beeping]

Mr. Kemp?

Mr. Kemp.

I'm Charlie Moore.

They tell us you can talk now,

and your condition is stable.

You're doing all right.

Can I have that in writing?

I'll see what I can do.

If you're up to it,
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

Okay.

Do you remember
anything about what happened?

Well, I remember
leaving my office
that Friday afternoon.

I was driving out to the country
to have dinner with a client.

After that,
I'm a total blank.

Until I woke up in I.C.U.

So, you're missing a whole week.

Yeah. If you come across it,
I'd like to have it back again.

Will do.

Who's Franklin Porter?

It's one of my partners.

Manuel Hastings?

It's a client.

We're doing
a big project downtown
in New Woolrich

Performing Art Center
and I'm the architect.

At least I was.

They tell you
the first person on the scene

was a guy who was
a medic in Viet Nam?

Yeah. I was
lying there on the pavement
and my neck was broken.

I wasn't breathing.
And this guy came along

and he literally took
a Swiss army knife

and dug a hole in my throat
and stuck a straw in it.

And saved my life.

Lucky he happened by.

Sometimes I wished
he'd been running

five minutes late that night.

Was it my fault?
We're not sure yet.

It's been three weeks.
It's been four.

You're missing one, remember?

We have no witnesses
to the actual crash.

The other driver's
blood alcohol level
was slightly elevated.

And judging from impact,
you were both
doing the obligatory

ten miles an hour
over the speed limit.

What's the other driver
have to say?

They didn't tell you?

She died at the scene.

[monitor sounding]

[tongue clicking continuously]

Okay, Jason.

We're gonna get you
hooked up and breathing again.

We're gonna find it, okay?
You just hang on, okay?

It's okay. We're
gonna find it.

Where the hell is it?

You just stay calm, okay?
You stay calm.

I've got a pop-off in 111!
I need assistance, stat!

I need assistance
in 111, stat!

I need assistance, please!

You just hang on, okay?
Just stay with me.

I got him.
Sorry.

I couldn't find it.

I couldn't find it.
I'm sorry.

There it is.

Okay.


I'm sorry.

Sorry.

It'll be okay.

Take out.

Eighteen...

Nineteen...

Pull it. Come on,
buddy. One more.

Twenty.
Come on, big man.

We've got to increase the reps
on the right side. You got to
give me another 20.

Ah, man, I can't.
We'll work through it.

My right side's
not firing today. I'm done.

Man, you've got to get
the right side working.
You're gonna need it

when they find that cure
you're always talking about.

Ah, shut up. I hate you.
I hate you back.

I hate you, too.

All right, another 20.
Here we go.

Okay. One, good. Two...

That's the spirit.
All right. Three...

That-a-boy.
Four...

five...

One more time.
There.

Good catch, son.

One more.

There you go.

Hey, Leila.

I was beginning to think
you stood me up, so to speak.

Very funny.

Yeah. I'm working on an act
to take it on the road.

I stopped by the loft.
Coming along.

Contractors just doing
some last minute touch-ups.

This renovation's
taking forever.
But I tell you something,

I've got to get out
of here, Leila.

I really am going crazy.
One more day.

Everything is still on track
for you to go in tomorrow.

Good.
Is that ours?

Yep.

I wanted to show you
what a good host I am.

And wait till you see it.
It's magnificent.

I admit, I had no idea
how expensive this was
all going to be.

The lift alone, my God.

Well, I've got
to get up and down
between three floors.

You know, I still think
you could've consolidated it
on one floor.

Yeah, I've got all my
gym equipment, I got
nurses, there's me.

We can't live on one floor.

You sure you need all that
high-tech exercise stuff?

That stuff is gonna get
my body ready so that when the
scientists have found a cure,

I'll be able
to get up and walk, okay?

I know. It's just...
It's just what?

I just whoever sold you
all that expensive equipment

isn't taking advantage of you.
What are you talking about?

Your vulnerability.
Your frame of mind.

What?

This wish for a full recovery.

This wish is a
reasonable expectation

based on the latest
scientific research. Okay?

Fine.

I believe you.

I do.

Oh, boy.

Now I get it.
Now I get it.

You went by the loft and saw
how expensive everything was,

and now you're
worried about my finances.

I'm concerned, yes.
About your alimony.

Jason, it's not that.
I see all this money
flying out the window.

Do you have any idea how
expensive it is to be disabled

in this country?
The sooner I get back to work,

the better it's gonna be
for both of us. Okay?

Forget I said anything about it.

Look. Whatever happens,
I will not shirk my obligations

to you.
I know that.

I really do appreciate
everything you've done

while I've been here.
Most ex-wives

wouldn't even
show up in rehab.

Look. I've got to go.
I'm running late.

Okay.

I'll see you soon.

Have a good trip home, okay?
Yep.

Enjoying those blueberries?

Ah, thanks for
bringing them in, man.

No problem.

I hear you had
another pop-off last night.

Yeah, I'm getting
used to them.

Not like the first time, eh?

I don't know who was more
scared, you or that nurse.

Thanks, Mary.
That's plenty.

What are we waiting for?
Let's go home.

I'll tell you what.
You get that van around
here in ten minutes,

or I'm gonna
leave without you.

Find me booking down
the Jersey turnpike.

We'll get you a racing stripe
and some chrome mag wheels

for that Jalopy?
That's a deal, brother.

You got to go see
the doctor first.

No we don't.
Yep.

Let's go.
All right.

If we have to, we have to.

You've been absolutely terrific,
Dr. Schneider, and I hope
I never see you again

the rest of my life.

We never had a patient
quite like you, Jason,
quite so driven.

Your work ethic.
Your determination.

Formidable.
You really impressed me.

Listen now, when you go
home, don't overdo it.
You need time to rest.

I can't afford to rest.

If they come up with a cure,
I got to be ready.

Like I said, "Driven."
Who's taking you home?

Antonio.

I can't believe you
hired him away from us.

Well, if you paid these guys
a decent wage...

Ah, the man of the hour.

Okay. See you
in six months.

Antonio: Ready to roll?

Jason: Hey, Antonio,
slow down, will you?

Antonio: I'm way under
the speed limit, man, okay?
Just relax, now.

After six months of going
three miles an hour, this feels
like Warp Speed.

Man, I go any slower,
somebody' rear end us.

Now you just calm down, okay?
Just relax, we get there
safe and sound.

See, I told you, man.

You get to live to die
another day.

Jason: That's good.
'Cause I got a meeting
with my partners up stairs.

I'll meet you up there.
All right.

You a lucky man,
you know that?

How do you figure that?

You cheated death how many
times so far, three, four?

Well, five,
counting that ride.

Must be a reason you've
been at death's door
and back so many times.

It was an accident.

Somebody got careless
and crossed the yellow line.

How lucky is that?
I'm telling you, man.

Got to be a reason
you survived.

Well, if you figure it out,
let me know.

Hey, guys.

Jason.

Border and Mays,
how are you?

You look great.

I look like hell.

Remarkably fit, considering.
We've been looking around.

The place
turned out beautifully.

Man.
Yeah, you're right.

It looks great.

Which one of you
took my pool table?

Okay, Antonio.
Let's look around.

What happened
to my retirement money?

Jason, you don't have
to worry about money.

The firm is doing fine.

Without me?
That's very reassuring.

No, you were right.

They were able
to re-wire the monitors

to give you
voice-access to the computer
from every floor.

Per your specifications,
the lift is triggered
automatically

by sensors
in your wheelchair,
as are the lights.

Also per your specs,
you can turn them off
with your sipping straw.

A code overrides the sensors.
You can lock the doors to the
lift that way, too .

We don't recommend that,
for obvious reasons.

If you were me,
you'd be dying to lock
a door sometimes.

[elevator bell dings]

Ah, this is very nice.
Nice job.

Let's go take
a look at the view.

Same old bricks.

I guess I'm gonna
have to get used to this view.

Hey, it looks like those guys
over there redecorated.

Not too bad.

What's going on up there?
A major renovation.

Putting together
10,000 square feet
for a Spartina gallery.

Spending some real dough.
Who's the architect?

Hollingsworth.
Bud Hollingsworth?

He couldn't design
the stalls in a men's room.


You know, I always wondered
what went on over there
during the day.

Nothing much.
But, anyway...

Time to get back to work
on the Woolrich project.

Starting tomorrow,
I'll be on it again full-time.

Jason, the site's
already been excavated.

They're pouring the foundation
as we speak, they begin framing
next week.

Now, wait a minute, here,
how did that happen?
We had to re-assign it.

We made an agreement.
What can I tell you?

The client...
Insisted.

Wasn't confident
you'd return to work with all
your former resources intact.

So, who'd you give it to?
Claudia Henderson.

Actually, she's very talented.
Well, that's good.

'Cause then you won't
have any problem

giving her something else
to do. 'Cause I'm back

with my resources intact.

The Woolrich Center is
mine. Antonio.

I don't believe you two.

We can give
Woolrich back to you if...

Yeah, you sure can.
You don't have a choice.

But we're not
taking it away from Claudia.
She's been working

her ass off for six months.
And I got to tell you,

the client is very happy
with the work she's been doing.

You guys don't waste
much time, do you?

Did you give
the job away when I was on
the operating table?

'Cause you didn't think I'd
survive the surgery, is that it?

We didn't know
what would happen.

You're gonna have to learn
to work with her.

Look on the bright side.
Somebody's got to do all those

boring lunches...
Oh, the bright side.

Interesting way to describe
stabbing me in the back.

Come on. We got to
beat him downstairs.

Same old Jason.
Only more so.

Surprise.
Gotcha.

Sorry, Jas.
Oh, no.

How did I get down here?

Welcome home, Jason.

Oh, this is too much.

Hi, everybody.
It's so good to see you.

You look great.
Hi, Susan. How are you?

You look great.
Welcome back, Jason.

I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

We missed you.
Thank you.

Gents, where do
I find Mr. Kemp?

Right over there.
Thanks.

How are you holding up?
Hi.

A little overwhelming,
all this attention.

Listen. I came to tell you.
We went outside the department,

did some computer modeling,
and reenacted the accident.

And...?
It's her fault.

She swerved over
the center line.
No double about it.

So, for whatever it's worth,

you're not to blame.

Thank you.
This thing's really been
weighing on my mind.

Yeah, well,
that's why I came to tell you.

And pay my respects. So...

Well, next time
there's a homicide
in the neighborhood,

feel free to drop by.
I'll do that. See ya.

I want you
to get some rest, big shot.
We'll see you.

Okay.
Excuse me.

Jason, sorry about yesterday.

I shouldn't have burdened you
with my money anxieties.

Seeing this place
put me in a panic.

It's okay.

Jason, there's something
I've been trying to tell you.

I've been seeing someone.

And it's serious.

Wow.

Congratulations.

Look on the bright side.
If it works out,

no more alimony.
I'll light a candle.

I know you'll make something
good out of all this.

You always do.

Goodbye.

Take care.

Hey, you see that
blond down there?

Yeah, man.

Wave back to her for me.

[telephone ringing]

[elevator bell dings]

All right,
there you go.

Enjoy your party, man?

Well, after a while,

too much Vivaldi
can sort of make you seasick.

I know what you mean.
I feel the same way
about Phillip Glass.

Phillip Glass?

You think all I listen to
is Reggae Music?

Uh-huh.

Alison downstairs,
she's got me on duty all night.

If you need anything,
you just click.

I got my phone number
and beeper number
hot-wired to your computer.

Alison call me,

I'll be here before you can say,
Rastafarian and Rehabilitation.

I think you're
overqualified for this job.

I think so, too.

Would you do me a favor?
Yeah, man.

Open my closet.
I'd like to take a look.

All right.

Here you go.

Ah.

And put on your dancing shoes.

Bring up
Woolrich Projects
subcontractors.

Display a list
of Marble vendors.

Todd, bring up
Marble selections.

Hey, Janet,
get me a lemonade, please?
I'm real thirsty.

I would
if I knew where it was.

Mr. Kemp. Hi.
Claudia Henderson.

Oh, God.
I'm so sorry. Habit.

Oh, forget it.
People do it to me all the time.

The front door was open,
so I just came in.

I hope you don't mind.

You know,
my front door is always open.

I got nurses. I got aides.
I got delivery people.

The whole world just kind of
comes and goes as it pleases.

You don't know who I am,
do you?

Sure I do.
You're the new girl.

I'm sorry. Porter said
you were the talented, new girl.

At least
he called me "talented."

So, you've been
working on my project
keeping it warm for me?

Well, I hope I've been doing
a little more than that.

Actually,
I hope you haven't.

You know, we've met before.
I don't think so.

I joined the firm
the week before your accident.

We met at a staff meeting
on Friday afternoon.

You'll have to forgive me.
Ordinarily I'd remember, but...

There's no reason
that you should.

No, in fact,
I have a photographic memory
for names, faces, blueprints,

trivial statistics.
But I don't have any memory

from that Friday afternoon
until the accident.

It's gone. It's erased
from the hard drive.

It never happened.
It must be disconcerting

to have a gap
in your memory like that.

Thank you.

Yep. It's just about
the same size as the gap
in my spinal cord.

I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.

Well, who is?

Most people don't even
know how to look me in the eye.

This wheelchair
just kind of freaks them out.

I have to admit,
I'm a little bit
freaked out myself.

Um, should we get started?
Yeah.

I have a
few questions first.

I thought you might.

Okay. I'm trying
to set a meeting with

Woolrich's project point person
do discuss furnishings, fabrics,

wallpaper, paint colors...

You want to join us?
I'd rather drink--

Don't finish that.
I'll take the meeting.

I can't seem to find a vendor
to supply the Olivine Marble.

What about Lombardi?
Bankrupt.

You might want to start
thinking about alternatives.

Tell Polutzi to give me a price.

Tell him?
He owes me.

Gotcha.

Sorry. Could you just ask Janet
to come up a minute?

Sure. What do you need?
Just anything to drink.

My throat's killing me.
I'll get it.

You don't mind?
Of course not.

Thanks.

And the straws
are right by the glasses.

Got it.

Bring up "Interior Tiles."

Show "Wall Selections."

[computer beeping]

Choose "2."

And bring up
"Floor Selections."

Choose "3."

And bring up "Sconces."

Thanks.

Okay.
Where were we?

"Sconces."

Call Lattimer & Fitzentrous
and accept no substitutes.

I'm impressed.

God is in the details.

[telephone ringing]

Hey, man.
Whatcha doin' sitting here
in the dark?

I'm spying on my neighbors.
I think she's just discovered

her husband's got
an online girlfriend.

Oh. Now she's really
reading him the riot act.

Serious mellodrama.
I'm telling you.

I'm gonna have
to get you one of those
surveillance devices,

get you that
all-important bird's-eye view.

Would that make me
a Bonifide Peeping Tom?

Definitely.
Go for it.

Ready for bed now?

No. I want to stay up a while.
You know, like a grownup.

I got a lady friend
I can go see.

Beautiful.

So she caught him
cheating on the Internet, huh?

You thinking
about fooling around
in cyberspace, man?

Well...

about the only way I can
fool around right now.

It wasn't always that way.

You were a lady's man
back in the day?

I did okay.
I bet you did.

Fix you that surveillance.
Thanks.


Achilles,
bring up "Telephone."

[computer beeping]

Dial 9-1-1.

[beeping sounds]

9-1-1 operator.

I need to report
a domestic altercation.

Operator: Can you describe
what's happening, sir?

Antonio:
Tell me when it's in focus.

Jason: Ah, no, not yet.

Better?

No, a little more.
Just tweak it a little bit.

Yes. There.
That's perfect. Perfect.

Great. Now how do I
operate this thing?

Pan, zoom, tilt.
Use your straw.

Cool. All right.

I'm gonna go left.
Um...

Oh.

[laughing]
Whoops.

I got to practice with this.

Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

I got to zoom in there.

Now that's odd.
What's odd?

What's that?
What's it look like?

It looks like a
personal surveillance device.

Bird watching?
Wildlife, definitely.

Isn't this illegal?
Probably.

I guess he's still
in the slammer.

In the slammer?
Yeah.

The sculptor across the way
beat-up his wife last night.

You're kidding?
Jason sicked the cops on him.

So this isn't just
cheap thrills.

It's in the public interest.
Call me Citizen Voyeur.

Is he gonna come after you?
No, I don't think so.

He doesn't know
I called the cops.

And I didn't
give my name to 911.

So what's odd?
Well, what's odd

is that he really beat the crap
out of her last night

and today
she doesn't look so bad.

She's wearing a lot of makeup
for this early in the day.

This is kind of exciting.

Bet you can see some pretty
sexy stuff with this thing.

Um, I already have.
After dark,

this whole building
goes from a PG-13 to a hard R.

Care to be more specific?
Remember, God is in the details.

Well, come on over some night
and see for yourself.

Maybe I will.
We'd probably end up
fighting over this.

I'm putting in another one
upstairs in the bedroom.

You guys are obsessed.

From here I got a straight shot
right down into the loft.

If you were my neighbor
and I knew you had this...

Would you put on a floor show?
Maybe.

If we were neighbors,
I'd be watching you
the whole time.

Yeah, sure.
Just be careful
you don't get caught.

I think I'll go upstairs
and setup the second camera.

Okay, party's over.
Back to work.

Right behind you.

Jason: He didn't call
the cops, you creep, I did.

[elevator bell dings]
Jason?

Oh, Alison.
You scared me to death.

I just came up to see
if you needed anything.

No, I'm fine. Thanks.
Are you ready for bed?

Antonio's coming at midnight.
No problem.

Sorry to disturb you.
It's okay.

[church bell tolling,
clock ticking]

[shouting,
glass breaking]

[shouting continues]

Woman: No! No! No!

Man: [yelling, screaming]

Woman: [screams]


[dog barking]

[electrical noises]

[tongue clicking rapidly]

What happened?
Did you have a popoff?


Let me just check your trac.

Go call Antonio.
Tell him to get over here.

At three a.m.?
Do it, damn it.

Do it, please.

Antonio: I hope you got
a good reason besides
you can't sleep...

I'm sorry.
I got no trouble sleeping.

I like sleeping.
No, I apologize.

I sleep like a baby, in fact.

I apologize again.
But what time is it?

Almost 3:30.
Damn, I think we missed it.

Missed what, man?

Whatever was
going on over there.

You sure you didn't dream it?

Ask Alison.

There was a whole lot of racket
and commotion over there.

And there was
some sort of light flashing.

Well, it's quiet now.

You see?
She's not there.

Something's happened.
Something's happened to her.

I know it.

Sorry. Traffic.

Hi, Claudia.

I'm running late myself.
I didn't get any sleep.

You want me to come back
after you finish breakfast?

No, it's all right.
I'm done.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

I talked to Charlie Moore
yesterday about our neighbors.

You did?
What'd you find out?

It turns out their name is
Ilene and Julian Thorpe.

He's a hotshot sculptor,

and she's a retired
New York gypsy.

A fortune teller?
No, not that kind.

A Broadway gypsy.
A chorus girl.

Charlie Moore says they're
gonna prosecute him for battery

even if she doesn't cooperate.
'Cause it's an election year,

the mayor wants to crack down
on domestic violence.

So he made bail last night,
he came home, and then

they had another
knockdown dragout fight.

You're kidding?
And then, after that,

he starts welding away
in his studio.

And I just, like,
could not sleep at all.

The night he gets home,
he lets her have it again.

So where is she now?
I don't know.

I haven't seen her.
I'm worried about her.

I can't believe
you saw them go at it again.

I heard it, and I thought
somebody would call the cops.

I mean,
she screamed loud enough.

Well, maybe she's just
trying to stay out of
his way this morning.

I know I would.
No, you don't get it.

This woman never
leaves the apartment.

I mean, she doesn't even
go out for cigarettes.

He buys all the groceries.
He buys the liquor.

I mean,
she's a major alcoholic.
But this morning,

this is the first time that
I haven't seen her at all.

Do you think
she'll testify against him?

Well, she just found out
he's having an affair.

How do you know that?
I saw it happen.

You are a nosy-parker.
She really gave him hell.

I think he's leaving her
for another woman.

And when she finds that out,
she's gonna testify against him.

Believe me.

All right, enough speculation.
We got a lot of work to do.

Come on. We still got some
major molding decisions to make.

97/62.

Hey, Alison. Jason.
Hi, Claudia.

Do you need anything?
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

Hi.
Hi.

What's all that?
Oh, I was in the neighborhood.

I picked up a few things:

some tomatoes, garlic,
fresh pasta.

That is so nice of you
to come cook me dinner.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't cook. I shop.

I thought that
maybe Alison could--

Ah, no, Alison doesn't cook
at all, believe me.

What are we gonna do?

Ah, well,
can you boil water?

I can try.

Okay. Grab a big pot down there.

Pot. Okay.

All right.

Ah, big.
It's a technical term
that means "big."

Smart Aleck.

A...big pot.

That's better.

Okay. Now you need a big knife.

Big enough for you?

Yeah, that's fine.

And what you do is
you take the tomatoes,

and you're gonna wash them
and then you dice them.

Define "dice."

Oh, no.
We're gonna starve.

I can't tell you
what a relief this is
from Chinese take-away.

I know.
I have this giant bowl
in my refrigerator

filled with
soy sauce, duck sauce,
mustard sauce,

literally five years
worth of take-out packets,

thousands of
those little squirts.

Are you sure
that you don't mind doing this?

Not at all.

Ah, that's the part I hate.

What, the napkin?

It makes me feel like
a big baby with a bib on.

I think
it's kind of attractive.

It's like,
a tuxedo look without the tux.

Would you go to the window
and see if she's come back yet?

Yeah, sure.

You want that?
Yeah, thanks.

It looks like
her stuff is still there.

She didn't leave him.

How can you be so sure?

Well, her jewelry box
and perfume are still
on the dresser.

She might leave
her husband but she's not
gonna leave her jewelry.

Well, that's my point.

Something must've
happened to her.

She probably spent the day at a
bar trying to get up the courage

to come home.
But she's gonna come home.
She'll be remorseful.

They'll be all
lovey-dovey for a few days.

And then
they'll go at it again.
Relationships like that

are far too complicated
to understand from the outside.

Next time, do us all a favor
and don't call 911.

I'm not sure
there's gonna be a next time.

I think
he killed her last night.

Detective:
Run that by me again.

Jason: So he comes home
and tells her he's gonna
leave her for another woman.

She threatens to testify
against him and ruin his life.

Then they have a fight,
and this time he kills her.

So, what do you think?
Aside from no body,

no witnesses,
no evidence whatsoever
that a crime was committed,

as crackpot theory's go,
very plausible.

Are you cynical
or just apathetic?

Did you see this murder?
I heard it.

You heard them fighting,
which married couples do
from time-to-time.

I heard her scream.
And then I heard him
sawing away all night.

Residential zoning violation
and not very neighborly,

but hardly a capital crime.
He was covering up a murder.

Look. I hate to be cynical.
But, you're lying in bed,

you can't sleep,
you're looking at the ceiling,

you start to imagine things...
I didn't imagine this.

Alison, did you hear a scream?

Ah, well, I was downstairs.

You telling me you didn't hear
Mrs. Thorpe scream?

No, I didn't. I'm sorry.
I might have been

in the laundry room.
I have a monitor in there
so I can hear Jason,

but I can't really
hear anything from outside.

All right. No corroboration
on the blood-curdling scream.

Yet. I'll canvas the neighbors.

Thanks.

Too bad that
wasn't going last night.

We could've gone
to the video tape.

You mind my asking,
what medication are you on?

You name it.

Alison, he had anything
which would

effect his judgment
or perception?

Sleeping pills and Valium.
I rest my case.

See, I think
it's possible that you

just hallucinated
the whole scenario.

Aren't you, at least,
gonna go and talk to them?

I mean, now don't you admit,
this is suspicious?

It's far fetched.
But, if she's not home

by noon tomorrow,
I'll go talk to Thorpe.

I'll tell him we're
trying to reach his wife
to drop the charges.

Give him an incentive
to call her and then call us.

And what if he says
he doesn't know where she is?

I'll keep my eyes peeled.

If I see any big sticky
patches of blood on the rug,
I'll clamp the cuffs on him.

Very funny.
In the meantime,

I'd take up a different hobby,
if I were you.

You, too, young lady.

Who, me?

Yeah, you.

You can't fool me.
You got a Jones for this, too.

I could tell.

I don't know, Jason.
Maybe he's right. I mean,

maybe we're just
letting our imaginations
run wild with this thing.

Do you think I'm crazy?

Not crazy,
just imaginative.

He killed her.

I know it.

Man: Take it easy.
Watch it.

Jason: Okay,
so he sold the sculpture.

Now what about his wife?

I mean,
in case you hadn't noticed,
she's still missing.

She's not missing.
She's gone. She left.

How do you know?
I asked him.

And you just believed him?
It was just as I figured.

He had a deadline.
He kept pounding away all night.

She was still pissed off
for the roughing up he gave her.

They had words.
They had a lot more than that.

Anyway, 6 a.m.,
she'd had enough.

She put some things in a bag.
She goes away for a few days

for some peace and quiet.
And she splits.

We don't know that.

Last night, after our cockamamie
conversation I inquired...

"Mrs. Thorpe left her domicile
yesterday morning

bright and early
just like he said.

What witnesses?

Super for one,
car service driver for another.

Driver took her
to the train station.

They both mentioned she had
an over-night bag with her.

What about her jewelry
and her perfume?

What about 'em?
They're still on her dresser.

You too. I knew it.
You know,

I take a pretty dim view
of this electronic snooping.

Why don't you take a look?
I don't have to.

Her jewelry and perfume
are on her burrow means
she didn't leave town?

She was in a hurry.
She left it. No big deal.

But are you
absolutely sure it was her?

I called Rhode Island.
I spoke to her.

She's there.

What about the scream?

I canvassed
that building, this building,
the next building,

the surrounding suburbs.
Nobody else heard it.

That's impossible.
Not if you dreamt it.

I got to get back
to the real world.

Kids, it's been fun.
Sayonara.

I'm sorry, Jason.

[siren in distance]

[clicking tongue]

I hope this getting out of bed
in the middle of the night

isn't gonna be
a regular thing, man.

No. Last time, I promise.

You know, I can
always get my old job back.

I know. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

She like you, you know?

Who, Alison?

Claudia.
Oh, Claudia.

Yeah, we're getting
along very well on our
project together.

Not like that.
Like a woman, like a man.

Ha.

Well, I only see
two problems with that.

One, she could have
any man she wants.

And two,
I'm damaged goods.

Contents broken
during handling and shipping.

Why would you want that?
I'm telling you, man,

when it come to a woman,

sometime waters run deeper
than you and I will ever know.

Have you written anything
I could checkout at the library?

I don't need to write it, man.

I know.

It can't be.

It can't be.

Well, she's back.
Yeah, big time.

Just like I said,
they're all lovey dovey.

But it doesn't make any sense.
They never were before.

Ah, I don't know, Jason.
I just can't tell.

I just don't see how
it can be her.

No, you couldn't prove it by me.

I didn't get a
good enough look at her.

This one seems to be
five pounds thinner.

Her hair's lighter.
Her mouth and chin are
a little bit different.

That little mole
by her mouth is missing.

Maybe she had it removed.

Maybe this one never had it
in the first place.

Notice anything different?
No.

She's not drinking.
The other one always had
a glass in her hand

and a bottle by the bedside.
You're obsessed.

Well, maybe,
but I'm not crazy.

What are you doing?

I don't think
that's the real Mrs. Thorpe.

I'm gonna find out
who she is.

Jason: I'm gonna need
Thorpe's email address.

Claudia: Let's hope
he does some business
over the Internet.

I know he shipped
that big package out
the morning after

his wife disappeared.
Well, we know the date.

We need to know
the name of the shipper.

Evergreen.

How'd you know that?
The uniform.

They have little green markings
over the right breast pocket.

You do have an eye for detail.

I'll see if I can find one.
Thanks.

Ah, yeah.

Anything?

He shipped that piece
up to Vermont.

Bronze casting place
up near Burlington.

They are very closed-mouthed
about their customers.

They did tell me
the name of the gallery
in New York. Kimbro.

I called, told her I was
interested in Thorpe's latest.

Yes?
Already spoken for.

Just like he told Charlie.
Gallery owner said

he doesn't produce a lot.
"Much in demand"

was the phrase she used.
Did you get his email address?

No luck.

Do you really think
he killed his wife?

I mean, deep down,
are you 100 percent on this?

One hundred percent.

That woman over there,
she's not Ilene Thorpe?

No.

Even though
Charlie checked her I.D.?

You can fake an I.D.

So if she's not
Ilene Thorpe...

Then who is she?
And where is Ilene Thorpe?

Okay.

Just checking the temperature
on your conspiracy theory.

Have I convinced you?

Jury's still out.
But I'm keeping an open mind.

That's all I ask.

And an open line.

What?

I've got an idea.

Mr. Thorpe:
So these are...

these are some of my
newer pieces.

Claudia:
They're great.

They're so unusual.

But, actually,
I'm looking for larger pieces.

How large?
Pieces that you could

display in public areas,
lobby's, that kind of thing.

I just finished
something like that.

Can I see it?
It's not here.

I sent it out a few days ago.

You wouldn't have a slide,
or a photograph, something?

I'll get you something.
That would be great.

Okay.

Cover me.
Okay.

[door opens]
He's coming back. Quick.

He's coming back
from the room.

This piece is interesting.
Thank you.

It's not available.
Sorry.

Oh, you found it.
Yeah.

Oh, that's incredible.
You like it?

Oh, very much.
Can you tell me who

commissioned this piece? I'd
love to see it in the flesh.

You'd have
to contact my gallery.

"Kimbro."
[laughing]

You know my work.
Yeah.

Like I said,
I'm a fan.

Um, may I use your bathroom?

Yeah, it's ah...

Thanks.

Have fun.

He's still in the other room.

Okay, he walked away.

Yeah, look there.
Look through there.

Yeah, look through there.

Oh, wait till you see this.

You're okay.

He's coming back.
He's coming back.

Hey.
Hey.

Thank you so much
for showing me your work.

I really appreciate it.
Thanks for your interest.

I'll be in touch.
Okay.

Okay.

Bye.
Bye.

[siren in distance]

Jason: Oh, no. Oh, no.

Damn.

Claudia, pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

He knows you've been
snooping around.

Get out of there, quick.
You're breaking up.

Get out of there, quick.
Quick, quick.

Claudia: Hello?

Thanks for the heads up.
I took the stairs.

Whew! That was a close one.

Yeah, too close.
No kidding.

Sorry, I messed up.
Did you get his email address?

Yes. Don't do
anything rash with it.

Who, me?
You.

Listen. You were right.
I was?

Uh-huh. There is definitely a
new girl in residence over there

and the old one
is not coming back.

What convinced you?
Ilene's things have been

put away and replaced
by some other woman's,

and it's not the same stuff.

Any sign of another name?
No. Whoever she is,

she's still going
by the name Ilene Thorpe

using her I.D.,
her checkbook...

Oh, boy. I blew it.

If I hadn't left that screen up,
he'd never have known.

No, maybe that's good.
It might make him nervous.

And if he gets nervous,
he might make a big mistake.

What now?

Well, since
he's already sweating...

why don't we turn up the heat?

[computer beeping]

"I know that woman's
not your wife.

"I know what you did.

"I know who you are.

And you won't
get away with it."

"Send."
[computer beeps]

And now we wait.

[dog barking]

Come on, turn around.

Turn around
and go to the computer.

Come on.

That's it.
Boot it up.

Okay.

Come on.
Read your mail.

All right.

That's it.

All right.
Send me something back.

Bring up email.

Read.

What do I want?

What do I want?

Email to Handrasp.

[computer beeping]

"I want to nail you, pal."

"I want to make you pay for
what you've done."

"I want you
to lie awake and wonder

when they're coming to get you."

"Send."

[elevator dings]

Turn off the lights!
Turn off the lights!

Sorry. Sorry.
Are you okay?

Yes.
What is it?

I just came up
to see if you wanted me
to wash your hair.

No, thank you.
Okay.

Um, do you want me
to leave these off?

Yes, please.
All right. Sorry.

Dial Charlie Moore.
[computer beeping]

[phone ringing]
Woman: Yes?

Mrs. Moore, it's Jason Kemp.
Is Charlie there?

He's working a case.
If you like, I can page him.

Tell him that the boy
isn't crying wolf this time.
The wolf's at the door.

And have him call me
the minute he comes in.

I'll be up.
Okay, I'll tell him.

Thank you.

Disconnect.
[beep, dial tone]

Dial "Claudia Henderson."
[beeping sound]

[answering machine]
Hi, this is Claudia.

I'm not here right now.
You know what to do.

[beep]
Claudia. Hi, it's Jason.

Um, just wanted to say
that I've had dinner already,

so, no need to drop by.

And, um, um,
I'll see you in the morning.

Okay? Bye.

Disconnect.
Dial "Antonio."

[beeping, dial tone.]

[answering machine]
Leave me a message.
I'll call you back.

[beep]
Antonio, it's me.

If you get this message,
get over here immediately.

Hurry. Hurry.
Get over here immediately.

Disconnect.
Intercom on.

Alison?
Yes.

Would you please lock
the outside door?

Are you sure?

Just lock the door now.
Would you please?

Okay.
Thank you.

Oh, my God.
You scared me this time.

I'm sorry.
Is there something wrong?

Because you're acting
really weird.

I'm sorry, but I didn't mean
to take it out on you.

It's all right.

Is the front door locked,
the elevator door locked...

It's all locked.
Okay. Good.

Well, I think I'll settle in
and watch a little TV.

I'll be downstairs,
if you need me.

If you want to,
you could, ah, come on up
and keep me company.

Okay.

I'll just get my charts.
I'll be right back.

And a couple of
Valium for me, too.

I'm just kidding.

[On TV] Knocks it
into right field and
Hall's gonna be at 2nd

with a stand-up double.
You know, Frank,

I think that was a...

[elevator bell dings]

Hey, Alison.

Antonio?
Come on in and watch the game.

We're up by two
on the coast.

Who the hell are you?
You know who I am.

You've been spying on me.

You've even sent me those
charming emails this evening.

No, you're mistaken.
It wasn't' me.

I'll tell you what.
I'll check your email directory.

If I'm not on it,
I'll go home.

No harm done.
How did you get in here?

I walked in.
How about you?

The elevator door was locked.

Yeah.

I was already inside.

Alison, dial 911.
Alison, 911, now!

Alison, dial 911.
Alison?

I don't think
she can hear you.

What did you do to her?
Never you mind.

Look at yourself.

Sitting at that window

day in and day out...

spying on people.

How terribly,
terribly small.

Can you actually see anything?

I don't think so.

I told her,

if he'd seen something,
why did he wait until now?

But he could still
cause trouble, she said,

get the cops snooping around.

She's got a point there.

Hey!

So...

I need your password
so I can retrieve those emails.

Hand it over.

I don't remember it.

Too bad.

That little nurse, Alison...

Is it true
what they say about nurses?

Is it?
What did you do to her?

Little methylene chloride.
She'll wakeup with a headache.

You wanna cooperate with me,
that's all she'll have.

"Achilles."

Achilles.

How very pompous.

Don't you hurt her.

For somebody that,
I'm sure, spends most of
their time thinking,

you're not too smart,
are you?

Of course I won't hurt her.

No one will ever know
I was even here.

That's the point.
No one will know,

and everyone will be
a lot better off without you.

Don't you think?

Honestly?

Yeah.

That looks like it could just
fall apart right there.

You'd think they'd come up
with a better design, don't you?

Too easy to fix.

Oh.

On the other hand...

cracks in the tubing...

so hard...

to find.

[monitor sounding]

Enjoy the rest of the game.

I'll just turn up the volume.

I wouldn't want
somebody to walk in...

hearing you gasping
like a fish, eh?

I'll let you
get some rest now.

I'll try and
visit you again soon.

Okay.

Bye.

Achilles.

Change password.

[computer beeping]
to Icarus.

Achilles.

Icarus.

Bring lift to three.

Lock downstairs doors.

[alarm sounding]

Ahhh!

[monitor beeping]

Let's stop this
running around, shall we?

So you can
breathe on your own.

Ha. Nice one.

I'll get to the point.

You're gonna die.

If you give me the password,
no one else will get hurt.

If you don't,

I'm going to kill her,

I'm gonna burn
this place to the ground,

and you're gonna watch.

You like watching things,
don't ya?

Go to hell.

Antonio: Jason!
Jason, is that you, man?

[monitor beeping rapidly]

Man, what...?
Pop-off where?

[muttering]
Bang?

Let him go, Thorpe.
Let him go!

Back off!
Back off!

On your face.
Turn over.

All right, man.
Okay. Here it is.

Put your hands
behind your back.

Both of them.
Just take it easy.

Here it is.
I got it.

Ah, there you go.

You'll be all right now.

Antonio: She all right.

Well, I guess
you didn't dream it.

What do you know.

[background conversation]

Very fancy.

Pretty nice looking building.

For a glass Silo.

You know, you really are
a Philistine, you know that?

Actually,
I do know that.

How's jury selection going?
This is a pretty thin case.

No confession. No corpse.
Maybe no crime.

What about the sister?
She confessed, all right.

She did?

To being the
missing woman's sister,
and having an affair

with her brother-in-law,
which may be a crime...

But she didn't
confess to murder?

Why would she confess to murder?
She does that, it's all over.

Why does anyone
ever confess to murder?
There's no upside.

No, killers only give
it up on TV to better
looking cops than me.

She was murdered.
There is no doubt about that.

Plenty of doubt.
What about the perfume?

The jewelry?
Cornerstone of my case.

Are they just gonna walk?
Ah, not exactly. No.

We've got her for
impersonating her sister.

She kited some checks.
The fraud charges may stick.

Big deal.
And...

we got him for assault.
Attempted murder on you.

No, they are gonna do some time.
But for the murder of

Mrs. Thorpe, I don't think so.
I don't understand why

you can't find the bronze.
'Cause you find the bronze,

you're gonna find her.
I think that he stuffed her body

inside it, and shipped it out
right under our noses.

Jimmy Hoffa
and the Meadowlands.

Probably where he got the idea.

Jimmy Hoffa was never found,
let me remind you.

There you are.
We're ready downstairs.

Okay. You ready?

Let me have another sip.

Okay.

Franklin: You all
know my partner Jason Kemp,

who designed
this spectacular building
and saw it through

despite enormous odds
and difficulties.

I'd like him to come over here
and do the honors. Jason.


Thank you very much.
Thank you, Franklin.

And thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

This is really a
wonderful day for me.

A day I often thought
would never come.

First, I need to thank
some very special friends.

My right-hand man
and resident philosopher,
Antonio Fredericks.

My head nurse, Alison Rothman
is here with us today.

And especially my partner,
my, ah, very talented partner,

Claudia Henderson.

Without all of them
and their support,

I literally
wouldn't be here today.


Now I know that it's
customary on these occasions

for the architect
to cut the ribbon.

Well, that's not really
possible right now.

Although, I hope that
someday soon it will be.

Well actually,
I could cut it with my teeth.
Instead, I'd like to ask

the one who was really
indispensable on this project,

to come up and do the honors.

Claudia Henderson.
Claudia.


Thank you, Mister Mayor.
Thank you, Jason.

Yeah.

Woolrich commissioned
the piece from Thorpe.

It's been sitting
in our lobby all this time.

How could we
not have known that?

Remember that meeting
you didn't go to on Lobby Art?

Woolrich told me that he
commissioned some sculptures
from prominent local artists.

That you'd approved
the sketches. And it was
a done deal.

They never told me
the names of the artists.

I never approved any sketches.

It was the day
of your accident.

That's why I don't remember.

Good morning.
Hi, Charlie.

I just heard from the lab.

What were the results
of the X-rays?

Negative.
Are you sure?

She ain't in there.
We're back to square one.

Attempted murder
and Check kiting.

We struck out, kids.

See you in court.

I'm sorry, Jason.

I'm gonna take one last look
at the scene of the crime.

Sure. Knock yourself out.

Dead here during the day.
I keep telling you.

Nighttime is the right time.

Has the late show started yet?

What?

The...X-rated version?

What do you mean?

I think you know
very well what I mean.

Are you sure
you want to do this?

Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

You're incredible.

You know, it always
won't be like this.

You know, um...

Right now I can't,
you know? But...

I'm gonna be on
my feet again in a few years.

I believe that.

It doesn't matter.
In the meantime...

In the meantime,

we're just
gonna have to be...

creative.
