I'm rich!

Master.

Sir, I think you had a good time.

Come again.

Hurry up, Cuihong,
come to serve the master.

The ladies will be here soon, please wait.

Lady boss...

Just a minute.

How may I help you?

Where are the two ladies?

They'll be here soon.

Come here, Cuibing, Cuihong.

Yes. Excuse me sir.

Hurry up, Master He is waiting, go on in.

Okay...

Master He.

What took you so long?

We...

Sorry we are late.

Don't be angry, Master He.

Since they are here, sit down.

Let me drink to you, Master He.

Sorry I'm late.

You can punish us all you want.

Have something to eat first.

It's alright with me,

but my mates have waited for a long time.

Sorry, let me drink to you.

Thick branch, small green leaves,
lovely...

Hulu shaped vase with blue floral prints,

it's from the Ming Dynasty,
very nice vase.

Where's Cuihong and the others?

Lady boss.

Yes, Master Wang, how can I help you?

Where's Cuihong?

Sorry about that, I'll call them here.

They go in and out
while I'm admiring the antiques,

that's not very nice.

Right...

Lady Boss, I've reserved this room.

Bullshit, I can afford it too!

It's not that, but Master Wang...

Master Wang has...

So you're saying that

I can't afford the girls' company?

It's not that.

Did you mean that?

I didn't mean that,
please don't be mistaken.

Quiet.

What's all the noise about?

It's nothing, please continue.

If you could pick up the gold,

drink up the wine, and the gold is yours,

and you may leave.

Then we will.

Good...

It's real.

Thanks.

There are two more here, who wants it?

I do...

And more...

It's my turn.

Why aren't they over yet?

Master Wang, sorry.

Master He is giving out gold ingots
over there.

Gold ingots?

And why would he do that?

Cuihong and the girls only need to
have a cup of wine,

and they'll get a piece of gold
weighing five taels.

Master Wang, we...

Sit down first.

A gold ingot only weighs five taels.

These are money orders.

Guess how much each of them is worth?

How could we guess?

Let me have a look.

Tell you what,

the smallest amount is ten taels,

and there're ones with fifteen
to thirty taels,

there's one with fifty taels,

depends on your luck.

Wait, it's more fun
when we have more people.

Got it...

I want more.

Cuibing.

I want more.

Cuibing, Cuihong, come here.

What is it?

Hurry over to Master Wang,
there's a draw for...

money orders; whatever you pick is yours.

But it's gold here!

Silly girl, there'll be at least
ten to twenty taels,

and fifty taels the most.

Fifty taels?

Yes.

Hurry...

Where are the money orders?

Alright...

Let's begin.

Twenty.

Fifteen.

Twenty five.

Good for you.

Only ten.

And you?

Thirty?

Me too.

And me.

What about you?

Ten.

Damn it!

Those cheap whores!

Cheap whores!

There's one with fifty taels, go on.

Wait.

Draw? Whatever you get from this pile,

you'll get fifty taels at the most.

Wow! They are gorgeous.

This pearl necklace alone is worth
100 taels.

100 taels? Really?

There's more, emerald, ruby, coral... etc.

Those would worth more.

I think you'll like these.

Yes, we do!

Follow me.

Wait.

Wait, jewelry? I've got those too. Look.

They are really gorgeous.

Move away.

So you're in the same business.

That's right.

Where are you based?

Beijing. It's my 1st time south
in Guangdong province.

Is that how you do business in the north?

In our line of business,

there're no rules as long as
the goods are genuine.

No rules in doing business?

I want to see how good you are.

What are you doing?

Beating folks; is that your business
way down south?

You've got to be equipped.

We sit down to do business in the north.

Go to hell!

Stop it!

Stop it!

Stop it!

Stop the fight!

Stop!

Move away...

Stop it!

Surround the boat!

Move away...

Stop it!

What is it, officer?

Someone reported that one of
the two cases in here was

the one missing in magistrate's office
a few days back.

It's stolen?

Whose is this big one?

It's mine.

What about the small case?

Is it yours?

Speak up.

No...

Is it yours?

Arrest them all.

It's mine.

Is that the truth?

Yes.

My friend, you're drunk.

You...

I'm a jeweler,

I brought these two cases from Beijing.

I don't care whether you're from
Nanjing or Beijing.

Wait.

I've got proof.

This is my proof.

Yes.

There's nothing under my feet,
you needn't search.

Yes.

Wang Qinqin is an honorable business man.

We can wrap up and leave now.

This jeweler is quite resourceful.

Wait.

What is it?

My friend is really drunk,

he has lots of valuable belongings on him,

it's unsafe on the road,

please escort him home.

Certainly.

Come on, let's go.

I'm not drunk, it's fine.

This is mine.

You're really drunk, my friend.

I'll take care of this.

Go.

I'm not drunk, let me go.

Move aside...

Master Wang.

Bastard, you played a joke on me

just because you've got connections?

You're dead the next time I see you.

My head is clear.

Clear?

Yes, I feel much better now being
in the fresh air.

Are you sure?

Of course.

Look! It's my place over the bridge.

Are you sure?

Yes, of course, I'll show you.

Look! I can walk straight.

You can go now, buddies.

What's to watch? Get lost.

Let's go.

I'm not drunk.

You con artist from Beijing,

Don't trick me just because
you've connections, okay!

This is Guangdong.

It's good wine.

Boss Li, I've been to a lot of places,

and I've tried all types of wine.

But this is my first time

to try old wine in Guangdong.

Right, and it's my first time
I was made a fool.

Oh, it's you, Brother He.

Why are you dressed like this?

We often change attire in our line
of business.

Don't tell me you don't even know that.

Boss Li,

this friend was also

in the jewelry business,

but now... he's become a fisherman.

You! Damn it!

It's been a while, Brother He.

How have you been? Please sit...

Since you are friends,

and meeting here today by coincidence,

why don't you join us for a drink?

Get the wine.

Here.

I think you can return

my jewelry to me now.

Let's not talk about business today.

Yes, we...

Put the pot here.

Yes.

Please...

I'm done drinking, now I want to
get my merchandise.

There's no need to rush.
Everything takes time.

Fortune Telling,

ask me anything about your future,

I'm "Wrath of Ten Thousand Buddhas"

Pay up...

Refill...

Anyone needs his fortune told?

Why didn't you carry the case with you?

How could I carry jewelry around?

How could you?

How could I carry jewelry around?

Lower your voice, just lead me to it.

Sure...

So these handicapped people
are your friends.

Move away, we're not his friends.

He Zhen.

The "Four Handicapped Devils"

That's right, you stole our
godfather's jewelry,

hand it out.

But he stole it from someone,

I just borrowed it temporarily.

What's the big deal?

Bastard.

You have a short lifeline.

A blind person could read the palm?

Even a blind guy can see that
you can't escape doom.

1st stroke of Buddha's Palm,
"Buddha's Light 1st Ray"

Second stroke,
"Buddha's Palm moves mountain"

Third stroke, "Buddha's Palm
penetrating the heart"

Fourth stroke...

It must be
"Buddha's Palm having a seizure"

Fifth, "Buddha's Palm fanning"

I won't fall for that,
you think I'm really blind?

Damn kid, playing Drunken Fists

Can you do it well?

You can't fight while drunk,
it's the Waken Fists.

Waken Fists? Good.

Sixth stroke,
"Buddha's Palm squashing flies"

And this can be
"Clasping Buddha's Feet at last minute"

Take a break,

next.

Cripple, watch out!

Stand still.

Also a fake?

You'll need this now.

And it's the third round.

Left... right...

Come on.

How come?

That was a strange move.

What do you know?

I'm "One-Armed"; this is
"Backhand penetrating heart"

only a few can dodge this.

I'm dying.

Blood is everywhere,
I think we know who won.

Silly, that's Wujiapi (liquor).

Why are you using two hands?

I feel numb if I hide it too long.

You ruined your image.

Hide it.

That's right.

Tenth stroke,
"Buddha jumping over the wall".

This is the best place for wine.

Of course, we're good people,
we deserve the best.

Excuse me.

Come back.

We're here to drink, what's wrong?

A source informed us that
there's a jewelry thief here.

Ajewelry thief? Where?

Say no more, go to the
magistrate's office.

Let me explain.

You can explain in front of
the magistrate, go.

Wait, I'll be right back.

He Zhen is a good man.

Take him with you, and set him free
right away.

Yes.

Go.

Yes.

You can go now.

Master He is out.

Master He, thank you.

Thank you...

What for?

You sent a jeweler to our village,

and has donated a lot for
our Chen Village.

Thank you so much...

What did I donate?

Jewelry.

Really?

Shut up, continue.

You...

Old Wang.

How did you know me?

Not only that I know you.

Your voice...

Sounds familiar to you?

Oh it's you!

You must be here to thank me

since I've done a good deed
on behalf of you.

Being a Robin hood... I can do that
on my own.

You donated my jewelry,

why didn't you donate yours?

Brother He, yours were all stolen goods.

And yours...

I'm a jeweler.

Fine, then I'll rob you now.

How can you?

Can't I?

Hand it out.

My bonsai.

Cuihong, help.

Cuihong, you...

I...

She's my bodyguard.

500 taels, quite a lot, right?

Right.

Bodyguard? Then you must know
martial arts.

But you couldn't be my match,

you know this is no joke.

Are you scared?

Yes.

Scared to kill him?

You don't need to kill him,

just teach him a lesson.

Teach him a lesson?

You want to teach me a lesson?

Nice.

You're good.

Your martial arts is as good as
playing Pipa.

Right, don't hit so hard.

Pipa.

You're quite deft at pipa

You know internal kung fu?

Watch out, this vase is from Ming Dynasty.

That must be "the Hen spreads her wings"

Impressive.

He grabs a knife.

Help! Help!

Call the officers.

Madam Wang.

It's fair that both of you are armed.

Get out from the window.

Give up evil and do good deeds.

What for?

Alright, there's no need to go after him.

I'll thank your supervisor another day.

Head back, I'll finish this.

Yes.

Let's go...

Cuihong, are you alright?

Queer, it isn't a big wound,
why does it hurt so much?

These painkillers aren't working.

Calm down.

You said that my forehead wound
will cure in 3 days;

It's been five days, and it keeps
bleeding...

what should I do?

We've given you the best medicine.

What kind of head do you have?

Niuhuang, Shexiang (musk),
it's only getting worse.

It's a strange wound,

I can't heal it.

What? It's not curable?

No, I can refer you to a famous doctor.

Where?

Don't move.

Not good.

What's wrong, doctor?

The wound's been poisoned.

Poisoned? What kind?

I have no idea.

Can you do something, doctor?

I can't, but I think

you find the guy who did this to you
for the antidote.

Cuihong.

Move away...

Where's Cuihong?

Where's Cuihong?

Who's looking for Cuihong? Oh, it's you.

How's your head?

I'm here to look for her because of that.

Where is she?

She's real lucky, Master Wang has paid
for her freedom.

She's free? Where's that Wang?

He...

Tell me, hurry.

Okay...

He lives in Fuan Inn in Xiguan area.

Master Wang, this landscape painting

is by Liu Wenchuan of Song Dynasty.

It's rare you can collect the works
of Liu Wenchuan.

I heard Boss Yang is the only person

besides Prince Qinqin,

who owns his work.

Yes...

Prince Qinqin is a well-known collector,

if only we could befriend him,

that's a real blessing.

Yes...

It's not as difficult as it seems.

I heard that the prince likes to befriend

antiques and art collectors.

And he likes the good wines of Guangdong.

Also...

Also, a friend like me in the
trading business.

Oh, Brother He.

Why are you dressed like this?

Are you in some kind of a new trade?

You sly fox, I'm gonna beat you

It's fine...

We're mates. This is our way of
saying 'Hello'

Who's your mate?

Where are you hiding Cuihong?

Who... Cuihong?

The girl on the boat.

Oh, you mean Lady Cuihong.

We only collect art and antiques,

we don't collect women.

Right...

Stop playing dumb.

Where are you hiding Cuihong?

I really have no idea.

Be careful.

Will you tell me?

How's your head?

My head...

What are you doing?

Cuihong's sword had a poisonous tip,
that's what

happened to my wound.

I've been to all the doctors,
they couldn't help.

That's bad.

She must hand me the antidote.

She's long gone.

Sorry?

Wait, don't take this wrong.

What he just did

was part of our way to do business.

My head...

I have the antidote.

He's here today

is to ask me about herbal medicine,

I'm sorry that I can't entertain you.

Sorry about it, excuse me...

No problem.

We'll come back another day.

Yes, another day.

Goodbye...

Pack up...

I didn't learn any of Cuihong's
martial arts skills,

but she's passed me the prescription
of the antidote.

Hand it out.

No rush, let's talk about terms first.

Conditions...

Cuihong mentioned that if you're poisoned,

it will only get worse if you're angry.

What are the terms?

Take me as your master.

Shit!

Look at my fist,

do you think you're good enough
to be my master?

Maybe not this, but for this, yes.

You're playing a trick on me again.

Right...

you must kneel in front of your master.

Kneel...

And kowtow...

Antidote.

Second kowtow.

Oh no, this is the last packet.

Third kowtows.

Where's the prescription?

In here.

You...

If you break my head, then I won't be
able to tell you.

Come here.

Write it down.

I can't.

I promised Cuihong

that I wouldn't leak the prescription,

or I'll be destroyed by heaven and earth.

Where's Cuihong now?

She's become a hermit.

Then I...

If you follow me everyday,

I'll give you the antidote once every
three days,

and your wound will slowly heal.

I'll move in then.

No, I've already

prepared another room for you.

So it's premeditated.

Right, I want you to be a good person.

You...

Wait for me in room 'yu',

I'll give you the antidote.

Come back, you haven't greeted me
as your master.

Yes, master.

Fourth Prince.

I've done what you asked me to,

I've placed informants all around
the province,

we'll kill him when there's any
sight of him.

There's no need for you to travel

so far to Guangdong.

Slave.

Yes.

What you did was too obvious.

I rushed here because of that.

If the news spread to the Court,

they will execute me, you useless thing.

Yes, I could deal with it by myself.

Not you, you're a general,
and he recognizes you.

Don't show your face until
the last minute.

Fourth Prince, you mean...

I know his trip to Guangdong

is about wine tasting,

and collecting paintings and antiques,

you can start with that.

Think up a plan.

Yes.

There's more over there.

Where are you going, student?

My so-called master, I'm bored here,

you keep drinking and admiring antiques

and all those paintings all day.

I'm not interested,

I've got to go out and stretch, bye.

Kid.

Who're you talking to?

You!

Do I look like a kid to you?

Sorry, where's Master Wang?

Over there.

Who's looking for me?

He is.

Student, you must treat our guests
politely.

Please walk him in.

Walk him in? Come.

Be careful.

I'm here to deliver an invitation.

From whom?

What's his name?

From my master Fan Tiangang.

Fan Tiangang, owner of a winery,

he often hosts parties.

Student.

What now?

Aren't you bored?

Boss Fan has invited me to
the floating brothel

for a wine tasting,

you can tag along.

Fine, since I haven't been there
for a while.

Thank you for

treating me to wine tasting here.

You're very welcome.

I heard that you're a wine-tasting expert,

since you've traveled all the way here
from Beijing,

I'm honored that

you've accepted my invitation.

The pleasure is mine.

Come, let's drink another glass.

Sure.

Refill.

Yes.

Master.

Student...

You really lack etiquette!

Come and stand by your master.

You really think I take you for my master?

I'm only here because of this...

Isn't that enough?

Come here and greet Mr. Fan.

That's fine,

just let him sit there and listen
to the tunes.

Master Wang, let's have another drink.

Good idea.

Cheers.

Cheers.

So smooth.

Master Wang, the wine isn't good enough.

Xiaolu.

Here.

Do we have something special
for the guest?

Yes, nine different old wines.

What's the first one?

Celestial tortoise and deer wine.

That's a strange name.

Master Wang, want to try?

Sure.

Please.

Okay.

Please.

Please sit.

Please.

Here's the wine.

Very special.

Please.

Is this how I drink it?

Not like that,

like this.

It's not fun to drink alone,

let me drink to you.

You are very kind.

Xiaolu, bring the wine.

Yes.

Master Wang, please.

What do you think of this wine?

Mellow taste, smells good, good wine.

Another one

Yes.

Mr. Fan, this is the first one,
what's the second?

Five Dragons Two Tigers wine.

Dragon and tiger, must be very strong.

That's right.

Please.

Please.

Very fragrant.

Thank you.

The taste is infinite.

Please have some more.

Dragon rising.

Tiger leaping.

This doesn't seem like a Guangdong wine.

You know a lot about wines.

We have plenty more.

Let's go over there.

What's the name of this, Mr. Fan?

The famous Three Snakes Wine of Guangdong.

Which three types of snakes?

The galls of cobras,
striped kraits, spotted vipers

This wine is especially for
impotent problem.

He knows a lot.

You're from Beijing?

This fan weighs three taels.

Good guess.

Then...

Shut up, don't interrupt.

We're tasting wine here,

go play outside.

I'm off then.

Watch your head.

Got it, I'll wait for you outside.

Please.

The mix of the taste is different.

Please.
Please.

Master Wang, you're quite a drinker.

Five Chickens White Phoenix Wine.

Yes.

Please.

Very unique pair of cup.

Don't go.

Fox bone and papaya wine.

Fox bone and papaya wine?

Please.

Alright.

Still drinking even when so drunk.

My so-called Master, could we go now?

Student, once you get to taste
some good wines,

you should try to locate its source.

What's to find out? It's all from
Guangdong.

You're not from Beijing, what do you know.

Just a second.

Wait... what's the big deal even
it's from Beijing?

So arrogant.

This is monkey...

Monkey embryo deerhorn wine.

I think we should wrap up today, Mr. Fan.

All your wines are from Beijing, right?

Sit.

So you've arranged everything.

That's right, until you drop.

Whose idea is this anyway?

It's my idea. You don't need
to know the rest.

I have a few more, do you want to try?

I might not be the one who's drunk.

Xiaolu.

He's drunk.

And you're getting there.

Mr. Fan, you're really drunk.

Stop drinking.

Thanks for treating me to so much
Guangdong wine.

We'll drink again another time, goodbye.

I'll walk myself out, Mr. Fan.

Don't push...

Let's go, master.

They...

They're drunk.

And you?

A little.

Hey, you take care of them.

Yes, Master Wang.

Let's go, student.

They sacrificed for the fourth prince,

and they didn't reveal their identities.

You should learn from them.

Yes, I'll follow your orders, General.

Are you confident?

Absolutely.

Even if he could dodge my shoes,

he won't be able to dodge the painting.

Your wound won't heal that soon.

How much longer?

Do you know him?

"To Master Wang"

It's an invitation.

Zhu Yifeng.

Zhu Yifeng, who's he?

Owner of an antique store.

I don't know guys like him,

I've zero interest in antiques.

This will heal your wound.

What are you up to now?

How do I know whether this is genuine

or fake?

Just like before.

Give me the antidote once every
three days.

You must follow me then.

Fine, since you're so loyal,

I'll take care of you.

Of course! What if my wound goes bad?

Hey, messenger.

Master Wang.

Go back and tell your master

to get his most precious antiques out
for my review.

Yes.

Please.

Master, they're here.

Are you Mr. Zhu?

Yes, and he is...

I'm Master Wang's... student.

And he is Master Wang.

Master Wang, please.

These are the so-called antiques?

He Zhen, what do you know?

You're so rude.

Rude?

Please sit.

Please.

Boss Zhu, the antiques seem quite
impressive.

Thanks.

Let's go look at something else.

Sure.

He Zhen,

we admire antiques, not use them.

Do you agree, Boss Zhu?

Please help yourself.

This is Song Dynasty's...

Ming Dynasty's.

Master Wang, this is stone carved.

Ancient, from two dynasties before,

it's impossible to find these days.

And this piece,

first-grade carving, and...

it's made by thirty catty green stone.

Guess how heavy it is?

Master, it must be two catty!

What do you know?

Only a catty, right?

Better be careful.

Right.

Master Wang, those are of ordinary grade.

I do have more precious ones
from Tang & Ming Dynasty.

Please take a look.

Since I'm here to admire your antiques,

I need to see more to determine
the source.

Right... please.

Boss Zhu, my student is not
interested in antiques,

maybe he should wait for me outside.

Good idea. Since I know nothing about

admiring and playing with antiques.

What are you looking at?
I'm not a piece of antique.

It's fine that Master Wang's here,
let him go.

Yes.

Please continue.

That was strange, why did they
block my way?

White jade from Tang Dynasty,

Nice carving.

Thank you.

It's very hard. Nicely made...

Thank you for your compliment.

Boss Zhu, this was passed down
from the Court.

They're fine.

Do you have anything else?

Daffodil's pot with sunflower pattern
from Song Dynasty

South Song or North Song?

Late South Song period.

Nice pot...

Impressive, Master Wang.

Who gave you these antiques?

It will only ruin our day if I tell you.

Please continue.

What else?

Rare calligraphy paintings.

Please.

Please.

Icy breeze and famous springs.

Impressive.

And...

Sharp brush, really made an impression,

Yes, it's difficult to find now.

Why are they going in circles?

Shoes with blades?

Why are you fighting?

So my Master knows kungfu.

Good moves.

Spare my life, prince.

Boss Zhu, who sent you to kill me
in the court?

I dare not to say.

Slave, speak up before
the Eleventh prince.

Eleventh Prince?

Come on, speak.

It's Prince...

Which one?

I've sworn that I wouldn't tell,

or he'd kill me.

You know I'd kill you too!

Okay...

I tell you... his order is inside
this calligraphic art

you'll know after you've read it.

Hand it over.

Yes.

Master...

Help me, we must get out now.

Student He Zhen...

General, I've found out that
the person who helped him

was his servant he hired in Guangdong.

Do you know who he is?

General, he's a thug, doing some
illegal trading.

That's easy,

you two split up,

& focus on the places where
illegal traders gather,

ask around about him.

Doctor...

When will he heal?

The wound's deep, and his bone's
wounded too,

so are his tenderloins.

He couldn't walk easily even
the wound closes.

Is he going to be a cripple?

It's not that bad,

he can walk normally after a while.

Then...

Say no more.

I know my condition, walk the doctor out.

Yes, Master.

"Mountain God Temple"

You know the drill, don't tell anyone

that we live here.

Don't worry, it's not my first time

dealing with people like you.

This is your pay.

Thanks.

And...

What?

Are there eleven princes...

Princes?

There are fourteen.

Right... fourteen.

But who will the Majesty pass
his throne to?

So they're fighting for it.

They all want to be the next emperor.

Enough.

Got it. Please.

Okay...

Fourteen, the throne.

I didn't fight for the throne.

I'm not interested in the throne.

I only love antiques and paintings,

and all kinds of good wine.

The most important things is
practising martial arts.

No wonder you came to Guangdong,
your kungfu...

You must use your
martial arts skills right,

if you abuse it,

and gain by taking others' lives,

shame on those.

Remember that.

You can go now.

I'll leave after you're healed.

I can take care of myself.

You can't heal on your own.

If they are here,

I'll fight with them.

Your skills?

Yes, I know it's inadequate, but...

I must learn from you, Master.

Kick.

Stop, the angle is too wide.

It won't be powerful if the range
is not big.

If you kick like this,

your opponent will notice.

What?

Turn around.

Kick to both sides.

Watch your shoulders.

Kick.

Faster.

Go on.

Kick backwards.

You broke all the oil lamps,
why the clapping?

I wasn't clapping, master,

I was burnt by the wax.

Do you want to continue?

Yes.

Stop.

You only use your thigh

but not your lower leg,

that's why your shoulders move.

Do you have any idea that

the deal is worth 5,000 taels of gold?

It's huge,

can we handle that?

Listen...

It's easy money,

do you know a guy named

He Zhen in your business?

He Zhen? Who?

He is worth five thousand taels?

He Zhen?

Not him,

but a wounded person next to him,

he's the target.

Master.

Listen.

I want him dead or alive.

And you will be rewarded,

but you must know that

it will be a fifty fifty split.

Do the math,

if I hand it to him, the money
will be halved;

but by handing it to the General
I'll get all.

Seven Bitters of East River, sit...

What's the matter?

I want to talk to you about some business.

Not bad, kicks and retreats fast,

keep the shoulders level.

My leg's on fire, master.

I must kick faster to make it go out.

Shut up and keep going.

Back kick.

Right, the hands above, kicks below.

This kicking style

is called Shadow less Feet.

If I continue like this,

I'll end up as a roasted pig.

Come on.

Calm down.

Someone's here.

Who is it?

It's me.

Master, it's a woman.

Notjust one,

there are seven or eight of them.

Seven or eight?

You must stay away from women
while you're practising.

Master, I guess they've got
the wrong address.

Who're you looking for?

He Zhen.

Master, they're looking for me.

Why would they know about this place?

I didn't...

Who are you?

Seven Bitters (sounds the same
as tiger) of East River

Master, there're seven tigresses.

Ask them what they want?

What do you want to see me for?

I want to talk business with you.

Master, I've never worked with
women before,

I guess they must be something.

Master, you go inside first,

let me deal with them.

Why are you men so slow?

I'll charge in if you won't open the door.

Open up... hurry.

I can't wait any longer, I'm coming in.

Coming.

Hurry...

What do you ladies want?

Where are the ladies?

All you can think of are the ladies.

So you're the Seven Tigers of East River?

We're not that vicious.

We're the Seven Bitters, not Tigers.

Worshipping the deities so late!
You're very pious.

I was practising...

Practising to be a celestial being.

Shut up, what do you want?

You're very bold.

I heard you have something good.

Something good?

Very valuable,

a total worth of five thousand taels.

What's so valuable?

The one with you called Wang...

He Zhen, if you work with us,

then we can split the five thousand.

Work with me?

Are you worthy enough for me
to work with you lot?

Of course.

We all are very skilled,

but of course I'm the most gentle one,

They all call me "Suku" (complain).

No wonder you have so much bullshits,
cousin.

You want to beat someone up?

Right... we have one called "Aiku" (endure)

Don't worry, he won't fight back,
just begin.

That's where he got his name from.

That's right, you've worked hard.

We have one called "Kukou" (bitter mouth)

And of course we have
"Kumian" (bitter face)

Kumian (Sad expression),
and there's "Waku" (ridicule)

Have you had enough? What for?

What for?

Sparkling gold, you're all dizzy.

Why not?

I like...

And you?

Too heavy, I don't.

If you're still so stubborn,
drink bitter tea, come.

Drink up, brat.

After you've tried our bitter tea,

and you'll change.

Come on, and... change!

Now you should work with us.

Whatever you say, dear.

Are you impressed now?

Yes.

What happened?

Old devil, you can't play me.

So you don't want to team up with us?

Sure.

Have you seen an arm like this?

I've seen bigger.

But not so muscular.

You're in this for real..."Aiku" (endure)

Student, come inside.

That's him, catch him.

Don't let him run.

Wait, don't panic.

With these stack of money orders,

you don't need to worry about
anything from now on.

My master knows that you're only
doing it for money,

with these,

you can go wherever you want.

Money orders.

They could be fake.

Fake? These are used by royalty.

You can cash them all over the country,
Beijing, Yunan,

Sizuan, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Chaozhou,
anywhere.

How much?

Fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty,

ninety, one hundred, two hundred,
a total of 500 taels.

Silver or gold?

Gold of course.

Gold.

What are you doing?

I was right, master.

Hand those to them.

Yes.

Search.

Yes.

He's good.

He can hide away from the surveillance.

It's the 3rd of July,

His Majesty will announce
his successor in two months,

pass the orders down,

increase security on all the roads,

I don't think he could make it.

Yes.

That's right, keep it up.

Why did you stop?

Master, there's only half a month

until His Majesty announces his successor.

I fear that you're still not healed
by then.

And because of this,

I've pushed you

to practise everyday.

We've been practising here

for over a month already,

why there's no signs of anything?

Maybe they're scared of you.

I doubt that,

they're up to some conspiracy.

What conspiracy?

Find a tough bamboo rod

for my walking stick tomorrow.

Yes.

I need a wheelchair.

Yes.

And plenty of paper umbrellas.

Yes.

The walking stick is done.

And the rest?

We've umbrellas & wheelchair ready;
can leave tomorrow.

Anything unusual?

Nothing.

No sightings of those people,

I've guessed right,

Surely they'll intercept on
our way back to Beijing.

There's nothing to be scared about,
master,

we've got everything ready.

Never underestimate them, student.

There are many kung fu experts
working for the court,

and you've trained for long.

Remember, when you fight the opponent,

be sure to stand close to me.

Yes.

My master the prince,
this is a strange deserted town,

it's so windy since we entered.

This is a windy area,

its former residents built this town
to block the wind,

in the end it couldn't resist the storm,

and fell apart.

No wonder it's deserted now.

I've told you to stay close to me.

My master the prince, why did you
pick this road?

It's not a good road, and no one's around.

It's a shortcut, saves up to 1

that's why we must go through, push.

Back.

Nice umbrellas!

Mongolian iron beads cape, watch out!

Mongolian guard.

Who sent you here to kill the 11th Prince?

Did General Liang Jingcheng send you?
Speak.

Come on.

It's late, take him with us.

Yes.

No arrows...

Fourth Prince...

My fourth brother.

Why would he?

Come on.

Yes.

My master the prince,
there are so many soldiers here,

are they here to welcome you?

He must have sent them to guard the gates,

so that I couldn't go into Yangxin Hall.

We fight our way in.

No, if we do that,

it will alarm the whole Court,

and if my father finds out about my trip,

he'll lecture me.

We'll walk further and go in
through Beiping Hall.

Close the door.

Ninth Brother, where's Eleventh brother?

How would I know?

Do you?

It's an important day...

He must have gone out to play.

It's been a while, Eleventh Prince.

General Liang Jingcheng.

Are you here to welcome us
or to block our way?

Both.

You've got some nerves, you dare to block

the 11th Prince from attending
the ceremony?

Who gave you the orders?

He Zhen.

Yes.

That's between me and the other princes,

it's none of you slaves' business.

Yes.

He Zhen.

Yes.

Those two are experts, be careful.

Got it.

Attack on both sides.

Tsai Yang Blade.

Come.

Be careful his blade.

You deal with them.

Yes.

My master the prince.

General Liang's Tsai Yang Blade skill

has reached perfection.

Of course, General Liang contributed
a lot when

he was guarding the borders.

What kind of contributions?

Hundreds of our enemy died in his hands.

Impressive.

General Liang.

Who gave you the orders?

Shut up, it's not a slave's question.

His Majesty is here.

Here comes Eleventh brother.

Fourth Brother.

Your hat.

Long live our royal father...

Arise...

Thank you, royal father.

Pearls.

Your walking stick.
