MAN:
<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Reservations for what?</i>

<i>Crystal, we're not even</i>
<i>seeing each other.</i>

<i>We get together like</i>
<i>a couple of animals.</i>

<i>No, I can't come over.</i>

<i>I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of a business meeting.</i>

<i>Talk about what?</i>

<i>Let's end it.</i>
<i>It's over.</i>

<i>You don't exist.</i>
<i>I don't exist.</i>

<i>We don't exist.</i>

[Shuts phone]

Poof!


Any other substances,
Mr. Gaines?

Needles?

Fooled around a little bit
when I was a kid.


You have hepatitis C,
Mr. Gaines.

It is progressive and late.

Your liver shows signs
of advanced degeneration.

Kidney function is diminished,
as well as your immune system,

and your white count is very high.

These will help the symptoms
and slow down the process.

I strongly suggest
you talk to your family

about a partial liver transplant.

You're in no condition
to wait on a long list,

not even a good candidate.

A blood relative is your best bet.

Do you have any grown children?

Do I know you?

I mean, I guess you got that flyer
from somewhere.

A friend.

Really.

Which friend?


Yes!

I bet he can't even ride it.

[Girl laughs]

GUY:
Sucks for you, dude!

[Engine turns over]


BYSTANDER:
Loser!

Dude, you are pathetic.

<i>Adiós,</i> bro'!

ANSWERING MACHINE: <i>You've</i>
<i>reached Carrie and Danny Gaines.</i>

<i>Leave a message.</i>


[Disconnects phone]

CARRIE: I did it.
MONA: What?

I applied for that
San Francisco rotation.

Oh, I don't believe it.
Mm-hmm.

I probably wouldn't go, anyway.

You've done so much for that kid.
He's not even yours!

Mona.

You know what I mean.

I don't know what to do.
He aced out of school.

He's got no interest
in anybody or anything.

I shouldn't have even applied.

The boy needs a male figure,
and so do you.

Speaking of which...

Take this.

VINCE:
Hey.

Hey.

Can I, uh, interest you girls
in a cup of coffee?

Uh, no thanks, Doctor.

Oh, please, call me Vince.

[Ambulance siren sounds]

Well, maybe another time.

Sure.

Well?
What?

Yeah, he's interested in me...

a twice-divorced nurse pushing 40
raising a problem teenager.

Mm-hmm.

The guy lost a bet.

Uh-huh, now,
I hear he's divorced.

I gotta go.
Oh!

Oh, call me.
Yeah, uh-huh.

We'll go shopping.
Okay.

I'll see ya.
Bye.

Hey, you buy, you buy?

Relax!

[Police dispatch calls]

INVESTIGATOR:
How long was he at the party?

GIRL:

I don't know. I kicked him out.

Well, maybe you've seen him before?

Sometimes, around my high school.

At your high school?

[Telephone rings]

Hello.

It's, uh, it's Skip.

What do you want?

I just want...
I wanted... I, I...

<i>You wanted to what?</i>

Call here once every five years
when you're drunk,

or you're stoned off your ass to see
how fabulous we're getting along?

I, uh...

Yeah, I thought so.

[Disconnects phone]

[Shuts phone]

Mom.

Are you okay?

MONA: Your place is the biggest.
CARRIE: It's not a good idea.

Everyone will bring something.
It will be easy.

Besides, I kind of
already invited Vince.

Oh, my God.
You did not!

And he accepted.

No, he didn't!
Mm-hmm.

He did?
Mm-hmm.

Mona, who else did you invite?

All the losers.

Julie in Reception.

She got new boobs,
and her husband still left her.

Now she's in perpetual heat.

Jimbo in Surgery Prep.

He just relocated from Montana.

That Neanderthal guy
who wears the cowboy boots

with the bad teeth?

You invited him to my house
on Christmas Eve?

He's divorced.
He knows absolutely nobody.

And lastly, Bedpan Bob.

No. I can't.

The house is an absolute wreck.
I'm behind on the payments.

My credit cards are maxed.
I can't.

It will be fun.
It will be cheap.

You got something better to do
on Christmas Eve?

I sure as hell don't.

What about Danny?

He can come.

He'll be fine.

Mona!


MONA: She wears her scrubs...

VINCE: So, I decided
to start fresh.

...to the beauty parlor.

She's a fashion nightmare.

BOB: You can never
have too much wine.

My grandmother used to do that.

She had no teeth,
and she went...


BOB: My grandmother,
she had too many teeth.

Yeah, it made a weird
whistling noise when she ate

and when she talked.

And the thing was, not all her teeth
were in her mouth.

Oh, that's so funny.

That is so cute.

Danny, honey, I need you
out here now, please!

Bogus, Bob.

[Door closes]

MONA:
Hey!

Hi, sweetie.

Jimbo!

Please, could you not do that
at the table?

So, Carrie, uh,
Mona told me that you were

considering going
to San Francisco on rotation.

Well, I applied,
but I haven't been accepted yet.

Oh. Well, if there's anything I can do
to make sure it doesn't happen...


Please pass me a roll.

Sure.

Didn't you bring something, Bob?

I brought ham.

Oh!

Hey!

Anybody?

Bedpan, I...
[Laughter]

Why do they call you Bedpan?

Danny.

Perhaps it's because
emptying bedpans

for the very ill patients
is among the duties I perform.

Oh, I hope you washed your hands.

Danny.
Danny.

You have to go to college for that?

[Laughter]
[Knock on door]

I'll get it.

Let me.

No, no, no, no. I'll get it.

Well, are we gonna eat this or what?

Hello. I'm Mona.

Carrie didn't tell me
someone else was coming.

Oh!

Come on in.

[Indistinct conversation]

MONA: Everyone,
we have an extra guest.

This is...

I don't know who you are.

[Laughs tipsily]

That is Skip, my long-lost,
so-called brother.

VINCE: Brother?
CARRIE: Mm-hmm.

I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

Are you kidding?

From where I'm sitting,
you're an absolute hero.

Wine?

What do you do?

I produce...

...films.

BOB: Mmm...
Anything we'd know?


Hey, Danny.

Danny.

VINCE:
Uh, hey, everybody.

You know what?
Why don't we do this another time?

Yes, that's right.
Everybody out.

But we didn't eat anything yet.
Take your food with you, Jimbo.

Come on. <i>Feliz Navidad.</i>
<i>Adiós,</i> everybody.

Good night, you guys.
Thank you.

You don't know
what you're missing.

MONA:
Let's go!

Where's my purse?

Don't worry about it.
I'll help you find it. Let's go.

BOB: Let's do this again
when we have less time.

What the hell
are you doing here?

Excuse me, Carrie, Carrie.

Excuse me, sir.

Just give me one minute, please.

This is a bad idea.

[Door closes]


[Door closes]

We don't want you here.

Get out.

Get out!

DANNY:
I hate you!

I hate you!
We don't want you here!


MONA:
I am so sorry.

I knew it.

No.

I didn't get accepted.

MONA: We regret to inform you,
blah, blah, blah...

...more qualified candidate.

I'll talk to you later.

I'd like to try with Danny somehow.

Why didn't you want to try
15 years ago

when it might have made
a difference?

I know it's late.

It's way too late.
He's 17 years old.

He has no hopes, no self-esteem,
no interest in anything.

Congratulations,
you are a great father.

I need to see him.


Well, that's too bad, because
in case you hadn't noticed,

he really didn't want
to see you, did he?

But what the hell. You know what?
Go ahead. It's your funeral.

Oh.

You don't do funerals, do you?

Least of all, your own father's.

I had issues at the time.

You had issues at the time!

He was your father!

He loved you.

He talked for years
about you coming home.

He sat in that damn barn,

and he dropped dead
waiting for you to come home!

And what about Danny?

Waiting for his Daddy,
his Daddy who forgot his birthday,

who forgot Christmas,

who didn't give a damn
about anybody but himself.

Did you think about me
for two seconds?

Hoping that you'd come home
and help me raise your kid

so that maybe one of my marriages
would work out,

I could start a family
of my own?

You know why they left?
They couldn't handle Danny...

Your son.
Not my son, your son.

So, there...
you screwed up three lives.

How are those for issues?

Could you talk to him?

You want to talk to him,
you talk to him yourself.

Do you know what?
You don't have the guts.

You might be some big shot
in Hollywood,

but when it comes to the things
that really matter in this life,

you are nothing.

You're nothing.

MONA:
What do you think he wants?

I don't have any idea.

It's weird.

What you need is
some retail therapy.

Mm-hmm.

What? Money's tight?

Yeah. When isn't it?

Well, that rotation in San Francisco
will do you some good.

That's a lousy thing to say, Mona.

Is it?

Congratulations.

How did you do this?

Oh!

A certain doctor that we know
made a phone call.

What about Danny?

Danny is old enough
to take care of himself.

Or he should be.

[Police dispatch chatter]

Danny!

[Activates answering machine]


DANNY:
<i>Mom, it's me.</i>

<i>I'm in jail.</i>

<i>Please come get me.</i>

<i>Please.</i>


Shut up!

For bail? A bondsman
will want 10º% up front.

If I put the house up,
I could lose it.

You don't have the money
to get him out.

What are you saying?
I shouldn't go see him?

No, I'm saying that you don't have
the money to get him out,

but his daddy does.

Skip?

No. No, absolutely not.
I can't go to him for help.

He wants to see him.
No.

Make the deal with him.

He gets him out, and he stays
with Danny while you're away.

Oh, right, yeah...

I'm gonna leave those two alone
after what happened

last time they saw each other?

You think you can fix it?
Let them work it out.

There might be something
that you just can't do for Danny.

Let them work it out.

God knows you could use
the change of scenery.

Mom.

Are you okay?

I guess so.

Except for being in here.

Mom, the cops just came and...

Danny, honey.
Your bail is $50,000.

So, if you want to get out of here,
you have to do something for me.

Anything.

Okay. Just remember you said that.

Now, remember I told you I applied
for that San Francisco rotation?

I got it.

So, I'm going to be going
out of town, and...

Mom.

Honey, we need the money.

I'm behind on the bills.

So, I need you to stay at the house

and I need you to promise me

that you'll get along
with whoever is there with you, okay?

Is it Mona?

No, it's not Mona.

Is it the bedpan guy?
Please mom, not the...

No, it's not the bedpan guy.

Now, look, just promise me this,

and you'll be out of here
tomorrow morning, okay?

Danny, I need to hear the words.

I promise.

I promise.

Okay.

I love you, honey.

It's gonna be okay.

Wait, Mom!

Mom, don't leave!

Mom!

Mom!

The bank doesn't open until 9:30.

<i>Elliot, it's Skip.</i>

No, we need to talk, Elliot.

Yeah, tonight.

ELLIOT:
God, I don't know what to say, Skip.

There's... There's gotta be
another way.

There's not.

What?

No, I mean,

it's just that you
can't use your son like that.

I'm gonna talk to him,
see if he's okay with it.

Let me understand
something here, Skip.

You shoot heroin
into your veins for kicks, right?

Years later, it destroys your liver.

Now you want me to keep
this poor kid out of jail

so you can con him
out of a piece of his?

I told you, there's no time!

It's just a little surgery.

It's major surgery.

Things can happen.

This is my life
we're talking about, Elliot.

You are way over the line here.

I don't think I'm breaking any laws.

The boy is not an organ bank.
He's a human being.

So am I.

Oh, Skip. I know how you work.

The manipulation,
playing on people's emotions,

getting what <i>you</i> want.

The deals, the women.

And for 15 years
I've been right there with you.

He's my only chance.

Then face the reality, Skip.
Face it!

Come to think of it,
you are breaking a law.

A higher law.

You just keep Danny out of jail.

Hey, Skip. Come here.
I want to show you something.

Wait a second, we got to talk.

Danny!

[Skip whistles]

Be a man.
Tell the truth.

Take responsibility.

It's all I want from you.

Get yourself a beer,
and give me a hand.

No, I'm too busy.

Okay, it'll be here waiting for you.

What do you want?

Nothing.

That's a lie.
Why are you still here?

Because I want to be.

Another lie.

We got, uh, vegetarian, pepperoni...

Good stuff.

[Door slams]

Good morning.

[Cabinet door slams]

[Dishes clatter]

[Objects crashing]

Careful.

[Telephone rings]

Hello.

Hey.

No, everything is...

[Loud crash]

...fine.

Don't you ever steal from me!

If you need money,
you just ask me.

Now give me those pills back,
I need them.

Don't you walk away from me!

Look who's talking!

<i>Hello.</i>

Yeah, I need to get
a prescription refilled.

You know what?
This cell reception is pretty...

It's really bad in this area.

When he gets in, can you have him
call me at this number?

You're taking
more than prescribed, aren't you?

No.

We've got to get things going.

I need more time.

You got yourself a very old bike here.

It's a 16 Indian,
or what's left of it.

SHELBY:
It's a 17.

It's a 17.

I don't bring her with me
just because she's my daughter.

Can it be restored?

Yeah, anything can be restored.
Just time and effort.

You're missing a lot of pieces.
Some we can pick up.

You'll need specs, a catalogue,
chrome work.

Can we assemble it here?

No. No, it's got to be done at a shop.

But we've got lots of tools here.

This isn't like building
a model airplane.

You need someone
who knows what they're doing.

You're right.
You're hired.

I don't think that...

Wait a minute.

What kind of money
are we talking about here?

Hi.

I see you two have met.

Let's get started.

Danny, you're welcome
to join us, if you'd like.

That's a nice bike.

Thanks.

It's a 17, just like I said.

Everything needs to be cleaned
and rechromed and painted.

It's not going to be easy
finding what's missing.

The hard part's always the prep work.

And, of course,
putting it all together.

[Engine revs]

Danny's a bit of a show off
this morning.

So, I'll come back tomorrow
and catalogue what's missing?

No, not tomorrow, I've got a...
I've got a commitment.

But in a couple of days?

Sure.

[Knocking on door]

Court tomorrow.

you need to say.

Fix your tie.

Your Honor, we do not deny
the charges against my client.

We would, however, suggest
there are mitigating factors.

It is a first offense.

The boy is a minor.

And he has not had the benefit

of joint parental care
and supervision.

Has the mother been absent?

The boy's mother was killed
in a car accident when he was three.

His aunt raised him.

And who are you?

I'm the boy's...

His father.

As such.

I'm sorry, I don't quite understand.

Mr. Gaines has been totally absent
from his son's life

and is therefore totally responsible
for his son's behavior.

Explain.

Extreme negligence.

17 years ago,
Mr. Gaines had a son,

Danny, the defendant.

Did Mr. Gaines remain with him
to teach him right from wrong,

to instill in him the proper values,

to guide him into responsible
adulthood like a father should?

No.

Mr. Gaines abandoned his son's care
to his sister

who tried to be both
mother and father to him.

But as you would observe,
Your Honor,

Danny has, in fact, suffered
from Mr. Gaines' abject disregard

for his own son's welfare.

Mr. Gaines is a callous
and cruel individual, Your Honor.

And I would hope that you would
take these facts into consideration

to prevent a similar outcome
for Danny.

Do you have other children,
Mr. Gaines?

No, not that I know of.

Uh, I mean, no.

No, I do not, Your Honor.

How lucky for them.

You, young man, have a lot to learn
about respect for the rule of law.

I can decide that you are an adult
and try you as one.

Your Honor, I would like to take
full responsibility.

Really? Since when?

My son, uh, doesn't deserve
to go to jail,

and I'll take care
of all the financial, uh...

No, he doesn't. And yes, you will pay
for the financial damage.

But how do you plan on paying

for the damage you've done
to your own son?

Exactly.

How do you plead, Mr. Gaines?

Guilty.

If I see you in here again,

I will send you to jail,
you understand?

Yes, Your Honor.

Wanna give us a hand,
if you're not too busy?

I'm pretty busy right now.

<i>[Rock music blares]</i>


Who did this?

Here, we might need this.

I guess this is still good.

Oh, I almost forgot.

Complete list,
at least it was,

of the missing parts,
replacement costs.

I already ordered them.
Should be here in a few days.

Not cheap, are they?

Nope.

Total's on the next page.

Why don't we call it a day?
We'll finish it later.

You sure?

Yeah.


You want to give it a try?


[Engine revs]

[Engine revs]

Hi.

Hi.

Wow, did you do all this?

Where's Skip?

I don't know.

Sick or something.

Guess I have the day off.

Would you like to go for a ride?

Sure.

[Engine turns over]

Come on.

[Engine turns over]

Come on.

We'll take mine.


SHELBY:
This is one of my favorite places.

Yeah?

Mm-hmm.

My dad used to take us here.

I come here sometimes, too.

Really?

Sometimes.

To think about stuff.

Yeah, I know what that's like.

How'd you learn to build bikes?

My dad owns a shop.

You just learn it, I guess.

You?

Just raw talent.

Joke.

I'm not very good.
I can't seem to get it right.

Story of my life.

Is Skip your dad?

Not really, but basically yeah.

I mean, he never was before,
but now, all of a sudden, he shows up.

Now that you're grown.

Yeah.

I don't trust him.

What do you got to lose?

I got nothin' to lose.

Not now, anyway.

My life blows in a major way.

Can't be all bad.

Yeah, pretty much is.

At least your mom didn't sleep
with your best friend's dad

and run off with your soccer coach
when you were 13.

Talk about a role model.

That does suck.

You ever hear from her?

I'm sorry, I didn't...

I'm okay.

It's not your fault.

It's not anyone's fault.

She left 'cause she wanted to.

And dad just...

...drinks.

I just wanted to tell someone.

Come on.

This should have happened already.

Well, I can take more meds, can't I?

No. They won't help you.

You need a donor.

[Waves crash, seagulls call]

What's the matter?

You don't trust me.

I don't trust anyone.

I just want to hold hands.

You know what?

You're right.

You can't trust anyone.

What?

Ah!


Hey!

Hey.

Hi.

Great job.

Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't help out.
I wasn't feeling too well.

It wasn't me.

Thanks.

Not a big deal.

Um, I'm gonna go.

Look, you don't have to go
if you don't want to.

I have to help my dad
with some things.

I'll be back tomorrow
with some more parts, okay?

Sure.

So, I'll see you tomorrow?

Uh-huh.

[Engine revs]

[Engine revs]

So I found the frame
at an estate sale.

Uh, I put the engine together
with parts we had at the shop,

and threw this together.

Hope you don't mind.

No, it saves some time.

That's what I was thinking.

I'll be right back.

Something doesn't look right.

Maybe it needs a fresh set of eyes.

Have you lost weight?

Danny, take a look at this.

Maybe he doesn't want to.

We're missing a piece.

Let me see.

He's right.

SKIP:
Do we have it?

SHELBY:
We should. We...

We will.

Hey.

You want to help me
with the carburetor?

Sure.

We'll, we've come pretty far
on this thing.

Hey, Danny.

Hey, Danny!

Hey, Danny!





The bike looks good.

Yeah, it does.

Do you want to kiss me?

Stop!

I just wanted to...
I know what you wanted to do!

Couldn't you just kiss me?

I...

I thought you were different.

Just because my mom's a slut
doesn't mean I am.

DANNY:
Wait!

Get up.

Hey, Shel.

Honey, I'm...

Get up!

I can't live like this!

Honey, what are you talking about?
Do something! Be something!

You know it's been tough for me...

No, no, no. She left me too!
She left me!

What do you want me to do?
Be my father! Be something!



So, what happened
between the two of you?

Nothing.

I really screwed up.

Did you get ahead of schedule?

Did you?

She hates me.

No, she doesn't hate you.

You just...
You made a mistake.

You know, with women
it's impossible not to.

So what do I do?

You do something nice for her.

Like what?

You got any pictures of her
in that cave of yours?

I'd show her... maybe one or two.

I'm really sorry about earlier.

And...

Here.

Why didn't you stop?

Don't you care about me?

I do care about you.

I'm sorry.

It's beautiful.

Did you do this?

Yeah, I just...
I thought...

I know.
You taught me.

I'm trying.

Help me.

Help me.

Draw me again.

On the Indian.

Now?

Now.

Your dad, Skip...

He seems like a nice guy.

He seems...

...different now.

I wouldn't know,
so how the hell would you?

I don't know.
He seems...

...changed.

He looks at you a lot.

Also he looks different.

I don't think he's well.

Look, all I know is he never
gave a damn about me before.

So why should he now?

Maybe he's trying.

Maybe he wants something.

Like what?

Hell if I know.

Maybe you should give him a chance.

I am.

Sort of.

Are you done?

Not yet.

Are you done?

Not yet.

Are you done?

Not yet.

There's something wrong
with your dad.

He doesn't look right.

He looks okay.

SKIP: It looks like we
got ourselves an Indian.

Is there any gas in it?

Yeah, I filled it up.

It's ready to go.

Do the honors.

[Engine revs]

Dad! Dad!

Dad!

SHELBY:
Are you all right?

No.

It hurts real bad.

Where?

Right in my ego.

This calls for a celebration.

I'll get it.

My dad, he brought this Indian home

We never did.

But somehow, I know he knows.

Danny, this time with you,
it's been the greatest.

To the Indian.

What's wrong?

Everything going according to plan?

Danny, what's wrong with you?

Why don't you ask him
what's right with me?

And what do you want

What are you talking about?

You were too perfect.

Danny!

Danny, please.

Please don't do this.
Get away from me!

Danny, listen to me.

It's all a lie!

I don't want to hear anymore
of your lies!

Danny, what you heard is not
the truth. It's not what I want.

What do you want?
You don't want me!

You never wanted me!

You only wanted a piece of me!
I want my son.

Another lie!

It's true, Danny. I'm sick.
But that doesn't matter anymore.


Please, Danny.

Everything about you is a lie.

That's almost the truth.

Danny, I came back here
for all the wrong reasons.

Something inside me has changed.

I see how things
could have been between us.

I see what we've become.

Danny!

Nearly hit the jackpot there,
didn't you?

Let's try it again, huh?

Danny, no!

Let me go!
No.

Let me go! Let me go!

No!

[Danny cries]

Why did you do this to me?!

Why did you take
everything away? Why?

Why did you leave me?

I was just a little boy.

A little boy.

What was wrong with me?

What was wrong with me?

There was nothing wrong
with you, Danny.

Something was wrong with <i>me.</i>


I'm sorry for not being there for you
all these years.

I'm sorry for all the times we missed.

But most of all, I'm sorry
for not being your father.

Danny, you got to forgive me,
because I can't forgive myself.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[Danny sobs]

Can we talk?

The place hasn't changed much.

But I've learned some lessons, Danny.

Some important things.

You don't like vegetarian pizza.

I made some mistakes.

I made a lot of mistakes.

DANNY:
What was he like?

Your grandfather?

He was tough but fair.

Oh, he was a hell
of a fisherman, though.

I remember this one time.

It was near the end
of this competition.

I nearly held the big one,

and then the horn sounded,
ending the contest.

He was the winner for sure,

but Dad, he congratulated me
on the catch.

And then he made me
throw it back in.

He always played by the rules.

As time went by,
I got tired of playing by his rules.

We shared some great times
out at that lake, though.

Sometimes we just
cast out our lines,

sit back, look at the water.

We didn't even care
if it rained a little.

Dad had this kind
of quiet strength about him.

I see a lot of him in you.

You were named after him, Danny.

I know.

SKIP: You hungry?
You want something to eat?

DANNY: I don't know.
What time is it?

SKIP:
I don't know.

I can't find my watch.

Tell me about you and my mom.

Your mother.

Your mother was the love of my life.

She loved you, Danny,
from the moment you were born.

She was this actress
auditioning in Los Angeles.

I was pushing sets around
for six bucks an hour.

We met.

We fell in love.

We never had much.

But we had you.

One day she was auditioning
for some soap opera or something.

She was running late.

And this truck...

...crossed the divider line.

It took me a long time to get over it.

Maybe I never have.

Carrie...

She helped me raise you.

And after a while, I couldn't
deal with it anymore, Danny.

I just got up, and I...
and I left.

She loves you, Danny.

She loves you just like
you were her own son.

I know.

I'll do it, Dad.

Whatever it is.

Danny.

Danny, I'm all right.

Mom, something's really wrong
with... with Dad... Skip.

Mom.

Hey.
Let me take your bag.

Um, are you hungry?
I just threw some bacon and eggs in.

Danny, are you feeling okay?

I'm worried about Dad.

He takes these pills.

This is a very serious prescription.

This is for people who...

That's right.

It's okay.

It's not okay.

Is that why you came back here?
So you could die on him?

You came home for a partial
from Danny, didn't you?

You have no right!
Carrie.

You have no right to ask that of him!
Carrie.

You're right.

You've always been right.

I got so much more than I came for.

I got my son back,
and I got my sister back.

Those are the most
important things in life.

Maybe one day he'll believe me.

And you.

This is gonna hurt him.

This is gonna hurt me.

I'm so sorry for those things
I said to you.

Don't, don't.

Don't, don't.

Did they say how long?

Elliot.

Skip.

Yeah.

I want everything in a trust.

Yeah monthly...
monthly income.

DANNY:
Oh!

Oh, don't fall!

I wish Dad could see this.

How's that doctor friend of yours?

He's good.

We're good.

That's good.

I want you to give my attorney,
Elliot, a call when...

...when you get around to it.

How are you feeling?

Like I'm about 100 years old.

They say it's supposed to rain.

Maybe tomorrow, huh?

Maybe.

You know, you're...
you're really warm.

I thought that we
would go to the lake.

You said we should go sometime.

I did.

Honey, I don't think it's a good idea.

You drive.

I'm not allowed.

Neither am I.

It's a beautiful day.

It is.

So, what do you want to do
with the rest of your life?

I don't know.

I like to draw.

You're an artist.

A good one.
No, I'm not.

Danny, there's gonna be
so many people in your life

putting you down.

You don't need any help from you.

You understand?

Yeah.

You got a lot of opportunities
to do some great things.

I want you to take advantage of them.

My father...

He taught me how to be a good man,
Danny, and I wasn't.

Be a good man, Danny.

Be happy.

Honest.

Good.

We should have come here
a long time ago.

Dad.

Dad.

Dad.
