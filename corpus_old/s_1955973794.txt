(CROW CAWING)

Come on. Come on!



(BELL CHIMES)

He's coming!

He's coming!

Father.

FATHER FRANCIS: Jeremy.

Have you come to
pray for me, Father?

God can't help you.

You think you can trap me here?

Deliver this boy from all
sin, from hatred and anger.

What are you doing?

From lightning and tempest,

from plague and
damnation, I deliver you!

Begone, devil!

Tremble under the
powerful hand of God.

Cower in the sight of His glory.

(GROWLS SOFTLY)

(DISTORTED VOICE) You have
no power over me, old man.

This is sacred ground.

It is you without the power.


Your precious sanctuary
won't save you!

Leave him, unholy one.

Leave with all your wickedness!


Do you renounce the
power of evil?

Father, please have mercy.

Do you renounce the
power of evil?

Do you renounce the
power of evil?

Please don't hurt me, Father.

Do you renounce the
power of evil?

No!

(BLADE CLATTERS)

Saint Michael, our Archangel,
defend us in this day of battle.

Be our safeguard against the
wickedness and snares of the devil.


(BIRDS CHIRPING)

RACHEL: Michael!

JACOB: Do I have to
stay with Sofia?

It's only for a couple of hours.

We won't be long, I promise.

I made you something.

What's this?

It's you getting your award.

RACHEL: Aww...

Thank you, sweetheart.


You haven't seen my brooch
anywhere, have you?

Michael, we're going to be late!

I'm here.

Didn't hear me calling you?

I didn't. I'm sorry.

Hey, what's this?

RACHEL: It's a card.
Jacob made it for me.

I didn't get one?

You're not getting an award.

Touche.

SOFIA: Have a good time.

I'll keep Jacob in line while you're gone.
Right, kiddo?



(CLEARS THROAT)
(MICHAEL ZIPS ZIPPER)

Will you read me a bedtime
story when you get home?

You mean something like "Wee Willie
Winkie runs through the town?"

"Upstairs, downstairs,
in his nightgown!

RACHEL: Michael. "Tapping
at the window,".

"Crying through the lock."

"Are all the children in their beds?
It's past 8 o'clock"

Michael!

What do you want for dinner?

Ice cream.

Chicken nuggets it is.

(DOG WHINING)

What's wrong, boy?


Don't worry.

If we take the freeway, we
should get there in time.

How long has it been going on?
(ENGINE STARTS)

I have no idea what
you're talking about.

Don't.

Rachel, it's a big night.

Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait.
We need to talk.

Hon, we're gonna be late.
Just answer the question.

How long?

Please, not now. Not tonight.


Oh, my God! Jacob!

He's supposed to
be in the house.

Call 911!

I am, I am.

ambulance immediately

to 508 Hapgood Way.

My son's been hit by a car.

He's seven.

He's got difficulty breathing, rapid
heart rate, unstable vital signs.

Tell Dr. Stubeck we've
got a hot unload.

What have we got?
Seven-year-old male.

Possible punctured lung.

NURSE: Get him on the table.

Get me an amp of epi.

NURSE 2: He's going in to V-fib.

DR. STUBECK: He's unstable.

We need to start compressions.

DR. STUBECK: Get me
a cart over here!

(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

NURSE: Where the
hell is that epi?

(SUSTAINED BEEPS) DR.
STUBECK: We're losing him.

NURSE: Losing pulse.

Charging to 120.

Get me another amp of epi.

(SUSTAINED BEEPS) NURSE: Clear.

(SUSTAINED BEEPS)

(SUSTAINED BEEPS)


NURSE: Call it.


(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(RAIN PATTERING)

You're gonna have to say
something eventually.

Rachel?

For crying out loud, we're
coming from our son's funeral.

Please.

Fine.

Michael! (BRAKE SQUEALS)


RACHEL: What the hell
is the matter with you?

It just came out of nowhere.

Right!

MICHAEL: You know what?

Why don't you just say it?
Say what?

That you blame me for Jacob.

Do you?

It was an accident, Rachel.

Were you drinking?

Is that what you think?

I had one drink that night while
I was getting ready. One.

It's never just one. No,
I wasn't drunk, Rachel!

Yeah, right. MICHAEL:
Oh, come on!

(THUNDER RUMBLING) (DOG WHINING)

(DOG WHINING)

It's in pain.

Well, call a vet.

(DOG WHINING)

Michael, you can't.

(BONES BREAKING)
(MICHAEL GRUNTS)

We can't just leave it here.

Stay here. I'll be right back.

Can I help you?

Actually, I was hoping
I could help you.

It's been a really bad day.

What's he want?

Would you like to
have your son back?

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

What did he say?

I asked you if... Yeah.
I heard what you said.

Now I'm asking you to leave.

All I'm asking is that you
promise to protect the boy.

Protect him from what?

Did you hear me?

Small price to pay, isn't it?

For the life of your son?

Okay, that's it. Michael.

Bring the body back here.

I'll take care of
everything else.

THE STRANGER: Good day to you.

(THUNDER RUMBLING AND
RAIN PATTERING CONTINUES)


(ENGINE STARTS)


(THUNDER RUMBLING)

MICHAEL: I can't believe
you're even thinking about it.

RACHEL: It came back
to life, Michael.

MICHAEL: Yes.

But digging up our son's body?

Handing it over
to some stranger?

It's insane.

Yeah, it is.

Thank you.

What have we got to lose?

Listen to yourself!

Are you honestly willing
to go out there right now

and dig up Jacob's grave?

Because I know I'm not.

MICHAEL: Get down, get down.

It's clear. Come on.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

(SIREN CHIRPS)
(PATROL CAR PASSES)


(DOG WHINING)

It's gonna be okay, boy.

What have we done?

Everything we could.

Thanks. For trying.

(THUNDER RUMBLING) (SIGHS)

Wait downstairs.



(BIRDS CHIRPING)


RACHEL: Bad dream?

MICHAEL: (SOFTLY) Yeah.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
CONTINUES)

Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

What is it, Mommy? What's wrong?

Nothing.

Just so glad to see you.

It's really him.

RACHEL: Of course it is.

It's our son.

(DOG GROWLING)


What's wrong, boy?



(DOG BARKING CONTINUES)

Bruce?

Bruce!


(BONE CRACKS) (YELPS)

MICHAEL: I've had my demons.

I drank, I cheated on my wife.

But...

Three months ago,

I got a second chance.

We moved to a new
town, a new house.

And you know what? We're better.

I'm not drinking anymore.

My wife and I are
closer than ever.

And my son...


I feel like I got
my family back.


(APPLAUDING CONTINUES)

You pretending to be asleep?

MICHAEL: Nope.

You want to fool around
before he wakes up?

Yep. (BOTH LAUGHING)

(MICHAEL GRUNTS) (RACHEL LAUGHS)

RACHEL: Good morning.

MICHAEL: Hello to me.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

MICHAEL: Oh! (FOOTSTEPS
APPROACHING)

RACHEL: Michael. What?

RACHEL: Michael. What?

RACHEL: He's here. MICHAEL: Who?

RACHEL: Look.

MICHAEL: Huh? Hey. How long you
been standing there, buddy?

JACOB: I'm hungry.

Can you make pancakes?

RACHEL: Sure. Be right there.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Look at him.

He's like a perfect
little angel.

You know, this is what I
thought it would be like

when we were first married.

Me, too.

Have we unpacked
the spatula yet?

Let me look.

You know, I was thinking.

We should go to church tomorrow.

Church?

Yeah, why not?

Got a new name, new
house, new car.

New beginnings.

Sounds perfect.

Me like mine with blueberries.

So demanding. (CHUCKLING)

(RACHEL CHUCKLES)

Tell Jacob breakfast
is almost ready. Okay.

(BIRD CHIRPING)

(BIRD CHIRPING CONTINUES)


Jacob!

Mom says breakfast
is almost ready.

Jacob?

You out here?

Jacob!

Boo!


Come on, it's time to get
in the house for breakfast.

Okay.

MICHAEL: "Wee Willie Winkie
runs through the town."

"Upstairs, downstairs,
in his nightgown."

"Tapping at the window
Crying through the lock."

"Are all the kids in their beds?
It's past 8 o'clock."

I know I'm not like other kids.

I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

I feel different sometimes.

You make me feel better.

You always were a
good mother, Rachel.

Sorry, were you talking to me?

Is something wrong, Daddy?

Who were you talking to? Myself.

I saw someone in here with you.

There's no one here.

Michael?

There was someone here.



I swear I saw something.

Hasn't he been through enough?

I'm not making this up.

What's going on
with you, Michael?

MICHAEL: Let's talk about this.

RACHEL: There's nothing
to talk about.

There. They're gone now.

So, where were we?

PRIEST: The devil, Satan,
Lucifer, Beelzebub.

Often symbolic of man's
fall from grace.

The Bible calls him
by many names.

How can one not realize

that not only is the devil
real, but he is thriving?

Strife in the Middle
East, disease in Africa,

families being washed
away by floods.

His influence can
be felt everywhere,

constantly tempting all of
humanity to betray one another

to commit sin.

As Jesus said in 1
John, chapter 3.

"Let no one be led astray."

"The one who sins
is of the devil."

"That is how we know who
the children of God are"

"and who are the
children of the devil."

Jacob? Jacob, are you okay?

Michael, what's wrong?

You're the doctor.

"Anyone..."

"Anyone who does not..."

PRIEST: "Any... Anyone who does
not know what right is..."

Is it a seizure? I don't know.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

You have... You have to rid
yourself of the devil!

"Anyone who does not
know what is right..."

Jacob!

"Is not God's child!"



(PANICKED SHOUTING)

We need to get him out of here!


Go.

(PRIEST SCREAMING)

(SIRENS WAILING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

What's wrong with him?

I have no idea.

JACOB: Put me down!

MICHAEL: Get the car. Get the door.
Let go of me!

MICHAEL: Stop it!
(SIRENS WAILING)

MICHAEL: Ah! Jacob!

Let me see. Michael!

It's fine. Let's just go.

(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)


MAN: Father, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

What was that?

That was a warning.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)



Hey, it's not your fault.

You tried to save him.

You were the only one.


Look, I know you've been
trying really hard.

You have us. Isn't that
what really matters?

I'll be fine.


(ENGINE STARTS AND REVS)

Hey!

Why were you watching me?

Please take a seat, Mr. Young.

(HORN HONKING OUTSIDE)

How'd you know that name?

I know a lot of things about
you, your wife, your son.

You're probably thinking
you made a mistake, right?

Are you a man of faith, Michael?


Occasionally.


Well, when you've seen the things I
have, you realize that a crucifix

is just two pieces
of crossed wood.

Holy water,

regular H2O.

The real power

is in the devil.

What if I told you
he could be reborn?

If the right opportunity
presented itself.

Like a recently
deceased young boy?

Two loving, desperate
parents willing

to do anything to
get their son back?

Are you suggesting the devil is
responsible for bringing my son back?

I'm suggesting that
the son you got back

is the devil.


This is a mistake. I
shouldn't have come here.

So a complete stranger
pops out of nowhere

and offers to bring your
son back from the dead?

Come on.

You don't find
that a little odd?

You don't see the catch?

You think what happened at the
church this morning was an accident?

You think Jacob had
something to do with that?

(FATHER FRANCIS SIGHS)

As long as that boy lives...

What do you mean "lives"?

Not you, not your wife,

not anyone you care
or love will be safe.

This is my son we're
talking about.

It is not your son!

What's this?

He was barely 10-years-old

the day he chased his ball
into the middle of the street.

I ran after him, but
it was too late.

He was hit by a van.
He died instantly.

The next day, a man came
to visit his mother and I.

This is your son?

He offered us a chance to...

To bring Jeremy back.

But it didn't take
long for me to realize

that it wasn't Jeremy.

It was something else.
He'd become something.

I don't know. I got lost.

I was struggling for an answer.
I was scared.

So I joined the church.

And the Lord...

The Lord showed me
what had to be done.

You did this?

I did what I had to do.

You killed your son. No, I killed
the devil who looked like my son.

Jacob has to be stopped
at all costs, Mr. Young.

And only the boy's
father can do it.

Only you can stop Jacob
before it's too late.

You are out of your mind!

I understand what
you're going through.

It'll only get worse,
I promise you.

If Jacob matures,

God help us all.

For your coffee.

Jacob?

Jacob?


(DOOR CLOSES)


(WHIRRING CONTINUES)

Jacob?

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

JACOB: "Tapping at the window
And crying through the lock."

"Are all the children
in their beds?"

"It's past 8 o'clock"



I... I have to go. I'm sorry.

What the hell, man? Hey!

What are you doing?

Hey, hey, hey.

Hey. Say hi to Mom. Say hello.
(DOG BARKING)

Hi, Mommy! Hi.

(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Hu (LAUGHING)

MICHAEL: Go on, go on. Good!

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

What are you doing out here?

Oh, I was, uh...

I was just on my phone.

Can we have pizza for dinner?

Sure, yeah.


RACHEL: I can't
believe he did that.

What did he say?

MICHAEL: He just wanted to
make sure Jacob was okay.

RACHEL: And what
did you tell him?

I don't know. I...

I mean, last night in the
room, and then the church.

You have to admit, he hasn't been
the same since he came back.


after everything
he's been through.

I knew things would be
different for a while,

but these last couple days...

Maybe we should take
Jacob to a specialist.

You mean a shrink? No, I
mean someone to talk to.

Someone who can tell us if there's,
you know, something wrong.

What happens when the specialist
figures out who he is?


Fifty people at his funeral.

We had to leave everything

and everyone behind. I know.

We have a new life, a new home.

Can't just keep running.

We promised to protect him.

I know.

RACHEL: I thought you
were doing better.

I thought the meetings
were helping.

What does that have
to do with anything?

You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

You weren't exactly
there for him.

Or me.

We were having trouble.

Our marriage was falling apart.

And we're better now. Huh?

I'm better now.

But what's happening with
Jacob, this is something else.

Jacob, honey?

How long have you
been standing there?

Daddy? (WHIMPERS)

Why did you kill me?

Don't.

MICHAEL: How's he
doing this morning?

Better.

We're going to the park later.
You want to come?

I think I'm gonna hit up
a couple temp agencies.

Mind if I take the car? No.

I could use the fresh air.

Go get 'em.

I will.

Bye, Jacob.

How come Daddy didn't come?

He had an interview.

Is he getting a job?

I certainly hope so.

JACOB: Can we get a cat?

No, honey.

How come?

Your father's allergic.
You know that.

Can we get one when Daddy dies?

THE STRANGER: Mrs. Field.

You go ahead and play.
Mommy will be right there.

Okay. I'll hold that.

RACHEL: How'd you find us?
(KIDS CHATTERING)

THE STRANGER: Don't be alarmed.

I just wanted to see how
things were coming along.


THE STRANGER: What a fine,
young, handsome boy.

So innocent.

Pure.

My husband's
concerned about him.

Thinks we should take him
to see a specialist.

What do you think? (SIGHS)

He's a seven-year-old boy.

Moved to a new home,
a strange new town.

I'd be alarmed if he wasn't
feeling a little awkward.

THE STRANGER: Well, Jacob's
an extraordinary child.

As with many
extraordinary children,

you'll find that some people take
an unusual interest in them.

You mean hurt him?

You have to remember,
Rachel, Jacob is a miracle.

He needs your love and devotion
if he's to live a normal life.

Promise me you'll
continue to protect him.

Of course. At all costs.

Even from those who
are close to him.

I promise.

I'm gonna give you an address.

If things become difficult, you
and Jacob will always be welcome.

Jacob? Jacob?

Jacob?

Oh...

(KID SCREAMING)


Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I was waiting.

Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

Yeah, we don't want you here.
Get lost.

Leave me alone.


Ugh.

That's right, go home
to Mommy and cry.

(BOY CHUCKLES)

(LOCK CLICKS)

What's going on?
Is he doing that?

to be kidding me.

(KIDS SCREAMING)

What the hell is
going on out there?

We were just kidding.
We didn't mean it.

I think we better get out of here.
Let's go.

(KIDS SHOUTING)

Can anybody hear me?

(JIGGLES DOOR KNOB) Hello?


(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

(BATHROOM STALL DOORS SLAMMING)

Please!

Somebody, help me!

Open! Please!

Somebody, help me!

Go, go, go.

Run home.

Jacob? Jacob?

JACOB: Here, Mommy.

Jacob.

Hey.

I just heard about
what happened.

Are you okay? Yeah, we're
just a bit shaken up.

They said a number of people were
brought in to the emergency room,

but nobody seems to
know what caused it.

Well, the news is calling it some
kind of freak weather thing.

We got lucky.

Mmm-hmm.

I'm just glad you both are okay.

Hey, what do you say we get
some pizza on the way home.

Would you like that? Sure.

Come on.

(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)


(COUGHING AND GAGGING)

(MONITOR BEEPING
RAPIDLY CONTINUES)

MICHAEL: Jacob.

Time for bed.

RACHEL: Make sure he
brushes his teeth, too.

You hear that? Mommy says it's
time to brush your teeth.

(HINGE CREAKING)

Jacob?

Jacob?

Are you here?

What is it?

Have you seen Jacob?

Not since earlier. I
thought he was in here.

Oh, my God. Jacob.

Jacob? Jacob?

He couldn't have gotten far.
Come on.


Hello?

THE STRANGER: Such a
shame about Jeremy.

I don't think I got a chance
to offer my condolences.

Tell me, Father...

What was it like to bring that
blade down on your own son's neck?

He wasn't my son. (GRUNTS)




Father, you're
losing your touch.

Such a pity.




(THUDS AND GROANS)



I'm not gonna let
you do what you did

to my son and I, to anyone else.

I gave him a little life. You
turned him into a monster.

Well, one man's monster
is another man's God.

my God will win.


AND THE DEVIL WHO HAD
DECEIVED THEM...

WAS THROWN INTO THE LAKE...

OF FIRE AND SULFUR...

WHERE THE BEAST AND
FALSE PROPHET WERE...

AND WHERE THEY WILL
BE TORMENTED...

DAY!

AND NIGHT!

FOREVER!

Good-bye, Vetus Amicus.


So filled with anger,

consumed with vengeance you could
smell, but you couldn't taste.


Tell me, old friend.

Hmm?

Where's your God now?

(FATHER FRANCIS SCREAMING)

Oh, so much suffering. Hmm?

What kind of a God would
let his child endure it?

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)


Did your son cry out for mercy
before you cut his head off?

Perhaps he's watching now.

I wonder whose side he's on.

Jacob.


MICHAEL: Jacob?

Jacob?

Jacob?

Jacob?

(FATHER FRANCIS SCREAMS)

Come on.


THE STRANGER: He's getting
stronger, isn't he?

He's the one.

I feel it.

MICHAEL: Jacob?

RACHEL: Jacob?

Daddy? Oh, my God.

Mommy?


JACOB: I'm ready
to come home now.

I think we'd better go.

RACHEL: Now, you can't
just run off like that.

You understand that, don't you?

Jacob?

I understand, Mommy.

(JANGLES SOFTLY)

Michael?

Michael?

There's something I need to do.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(ELEVATOR RATTLING)

(BABY CRYING)

(PEOPLE ARGUING)


(RAIN PATTERING OUTSIDE)

"The Discipuli is a secret
society of wealthy noblemen"

"dating back to
17th-century Rome."

"They dedicated their lives
to manipulating bloodlines"

"in order to give birth
to a true Antichrist,."

"Satan himself reborn
in human form.

"The Discipuli believed
(DISTANT SIRENS WAILING)"

"that the birth and
rise of Satan"

"would usher in a new age,"

"in which they could achieve
limitless power and wealth."

(SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE)

Oh, my God.

DETECTIVE: Father Francis?

CLERK: Yeah, he was in room 156.

Hey, what are you doing here?

Officer? Officers?

Officer, you need to
talk to this guy.

MICHAEL: "After initial efforts
failed, the Discipuli realized"

"that their young subjects
must be offered willingly"

"by their parents
as sacrifices."

"The children would become a
vessel for the Antichrist

"until reaching maturity,

"at which point their

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) "the

RACHEL: What are you doing?
You scared me.

I scared you?

What the hell is going on, Michael?
Nothing.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Is this about what
the priest told you?

Where were you tonight?
It doesn't matter.

Look, I've been thinking.
We should leave.

What? Everything that's
happened tonight...

This week...

We should leave
town for a while.

For Jacob. For... for Jacob?

And where would you
like to go, exactly?

Here.

What's this? It's an address.

The Stranger gave it to me.
The Stranger? When?

At the park, he said
we'd be safe there.

What do you mean, safe? We
promised to protect Jacob.

You remember? Yeah.

You remember what he said? We can't allow
anything to happen to him at any cost.

And he's our son.

Right.

So what's the problem?

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(MICHAEL CHUCKLES)

You're probably right.

Why don't you put a bag together,
and I'll finish up here, okay?

Really? Yeah.

Okay.

(HORN HONKING)

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Why don't you go in and get some

Good idea.

I'll be right back.

We'll be here.

(UNLOCKING SEATBELT)

Quiet tonight, huh?


(CASH REGISTER WHIRRS)

Thanks.

Have a good one.

(LIGHTER CLICKS OPEN)

I'm sorry.


What happened? My God,
we have to save him.

No, no, no. Don't.
Get off of me!

Rachel. Help me. There's
a child in the car!

He's your son! No, he's not!



(RACHEL CRYING)

It can't be.

Rachel. Rachel, no. Jacob.

How could you do this?
(SIRENS BLARING)

Rachel. Rachel, Rachel, please.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Have you found my wife and son?

We'll get to that, Mr. Field.

No, you don't understand.
You have to find them.

You know how many murders we
had in this town last year?

Go on, go ahead, guess.

We're wasting time. None.

You know how many we had
the year before that?

None?

Smarter than you look, Mr.
Field.

Do you know this man?

No.

That's funny, 'cause I
got three witnesses

that put you in his hotel room
hours after the time of his death.

We'll get back to him.

How about this man?

It's that...

That priest from the church.

Now, the witnesses say
you were the only one

that went up there and
tried to help him.

In fact, you were the one that
actually put out the flames.

Is that true?

Yes.

Okay, well, here's my problem.

I haven't had a murder in
this town in two years.

Now I got two dead priests,

and the only connection
between them both is you.

Are you sure you
don't know this man?

Father Francis and I met up at a
restaurant a couple days ago.

I was having family issues.

He said he wanted to help.

Now, if you could just help
me find my wife and son.

(DETECTIVE SIGHS)

Wait. What's going on?
What are you doing?

MICHAEL: What's going on?

Too many eyes and ears.

(DETECTIVE EXHALES)

Here's the truth.

I've been following Father
Francis for a while now,

ever since he fled the city
after murdering his son.

That's not exactly
what happened.

I know about the Discipuli cult.

I know that Father Francis
was following them.

Children rising from the grave,

death and destruction following
them wherever they go.

Six victims succumbed
to their injuries

just this afternoon.

If you knew it was happening...

Why didn't you do
something about it?

I told you, lots
of eyes and ears.

We're talking about a
secret society here.

It's been around for
hundreds of years.

That's a hell of a
lot of influence.

What I need is an active case.

You're talking about Jacob.

Do you happen to know
where they went?

They gave my wife an address.

Can you write that down, please?

No, I don't need to.

I'm going.

You're the prime suspect in
an attempted murder case.

You're not going anywhere.
I don't care.

You can cuff me, shackle
me, do what you want.

But I'm going with you.


RACHEL: Hello?

Is there anybody here?

THE STRANGER: Welcome.

I'm glad to see you.

What is this place?

Someplace safe.

Do come.

Please, make yourselves at home.

After all,

it's been put here for you.

Quite the collection.

Oh, reminders of a rich
and storied history.

You know, we've been waiting
for this a long time.

I want you to know how
dedicated we all are

to seeing you reach
your full potential.

What potential is that?

Oh, don't be concerned, Rachel.

You and your son
will be safe here.

Is he my son?

Even if he weren't,

would he be less deserving
of your love, nurture, care?

THE STRANGER: Every boy
deserves a mother.

(SIRENS BLARING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Your husband's arrived, and
he's brought some friends.

I'm gonna need you to stay here.

You can't leave me.

If your wife and son are
here, we'll find 'em.

You... you don't understand.

It's being handled.

No. Hey!

Hey!

Jacob.

There's a threat.

We need to move
to the next step.

Can you do it?

Good boy.


It's police. We have a warrant
to search the premises.

Open up.

(CROWS CAWING)

(CROWS CAWING CONTINUOUSLY)

THE STRANGER: Jacob.

Jacob? What's he doing?
What's going on?

(CROWS CAWING)

RACHEL: What's happening?
What's he doing?

Doing what needs to be done.

(RAPID GUN FIRING)
(PANICKED SHOUTING)

(GUN FIRING)


(GUN FIRING CONTINUES)


You have to stop him.

We can't let them hurt the boy.

But he's killing them.

Jacob?


(CAWING CONTINUES)

Larson.

Get me out of here!

MICHAEL: Let me out!
Open the door!

Open the door.

DETECTIVE: Please, move!

Here, here.


Come on.

(BOTH PANTING)

Okay, Mr. Young.

What now? Now?

We find my son. Come on.


Come on.

We're all clear.

What?

Thought I saw something.


He's toying with us.

Might be the Antichrist,
but he's still a child.

I think it's time we give that
son of a bitch a time-out.

Yeah, come on.

He's got to be up here.

Come on.

Jacob?

Rachel?

MICHAEL: I know you're in here.

Show yourself.

Hide-and-seek?

Great.


Let's play, Daddy.

Okay.

My friend, he'd
like to play, too.

Is that okay?

Sure.

What are we gonna play?

How about we play...

Dead.


RACHEL: Jacob, stop.

You stop that this
instant, you understand?

It's your choice.



Look out.



You know what needs to be done.

He's the only one
standing in your way.

Please, don't hurt him.

I know you're not my son.

But I also know there's still
part of him in there somewhere.


MICHAEL: I'm sorry...

For everything I've done
to you and your mother.

I'm so, so sorry.

But you don't have to do this.

We can end this
nightmare right now.

All you have to do

is come with us.

Please.

(DISTORTED VOICE) You're lying.

(RACHEL SCREAMS)

(MICHAEL GRUNTS)


Finish him.

(MICHAEL GRUNTS)

Oh, honey.

It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be...

We've got to go. We've
got to get out of here.

Come on.


(CROWS CAWING)

Run.

Come on.


Okay, baby, gonna get you to a hospital.
(SIRENS WAILING)

Okay.

(TIRES SCREECHING)


Faster. Go faster. I'm trying.

Get off the road now.

Just get to the house. Okay.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

What are they waiting for?
MICHAEL: I don't know.

Come on. Wait.

(CAWING CONTINUES)

(POUNDING ON DOOR)

Upstairs, now. Now.

(DISTORTED VOICE) Mommy?
Daddy? I'm home.

(LOCKING DOOR)

(DISTORTED VOICE) Where
are you, Father?

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(RACHEL WHIMPERS AND SOBS)


(DISTORTED VOICE) You
think you can defeat me?

You think you have
power over me?

I'm the Father now.

(MICHAEL GROANS)

I am the Father, the Son.

I am the unholy trinity.


(SCREAMS AND GRUNTS)

You should know, Daddy,

this is all your fault.


Are you okay?

It has to be me.

Wh... What you mean?

I have to do it.
It has to be me.





Go to hell.


DOCTOR: Try to take it easy
for a couple of days, okay?

Keep off your feet, if possible.

And, um...

I'm sorry for your loss.

Thank you, Doctor.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)


It's never easy, is it?

So young.

So vulnerable.

You have my condolences.

However...

What if I told you I
could bring him back?
