(CAR ENGINE REVVING)

Yeah! That's right!

That's right! Thank you.
Thank you.

Dad, wake up.

Dad, wake up. Dad...

What? What?

Gonna be late.

Who is it? Who is it?

Dad, wake up.
We're gonna be late.

Who disturbs my sleep?

Morning.
Good morning. Hi.

Hey, can you take Becca to
school? I've got to be in court.

I've got a 9:00 AM.

So do I.
Sure... yes.

I'm taking you to school, kid.

You want an orange?

I already have an orange.

What's for breakfast?

You're too late.

Hey, did you call
that guy about the job?

What job? No, not yet.

I told him you would.
I...

It's an office job,
but it pays more than
what you're earning now.

In case you hadn't noticed,
we need the money.

I just don't feel like I would
be very fulfilled in an office.

I've got to go.

But, Freddie is so close
on the money. I talked to him.

I talked to him last week.
He hasn't called me back yet...

But, he's so close on the cash,
man, it's just like...

He just said like...

Well, maybe Freddie can pay
our mortgage.

Are you two gonna fight again?

Go get your bag, honey.

Yeah, go get dressed.

Go put on a tie... or something.

Look, I'm sorry, but using our
money to put a down payment
on that monstrosity...

It's not a monstrosity.

What is it?
It's a school.

It's a racing school. It's
a school where people race,
and I teach them.

I teach them how to race,
because that's what I'm good at.

It's what I do.
I'm gonna be late.

It's what I used to do.

Now I don't do that.

(CAR HORN HONKS)

Wait! Don't leave me!

Do we have to go in your car?

What's it look like?

You see any other cars
around here?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can sit up front with me.

No, someone might see me.

This is a perfectly good car,
kid. Your dad makes his living
driving this car, okay.

Speed bump.

This car pays for your clothes,
it pays for your food.

It pays for this incredibly
expensive school that you
take for granted.

Mommy pays for most of it.

Nice.

Okay, Junior, go on.

Have fun, okay?

Love you, see you. Bye.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hello.

Oh, hi! Yeah...

I'm just outside.

Oh... um, yeah, sure.

No, if you can give me another
couple of weeks, I will have
the money.

I... yes, I understand.

But we've had some plumbing
problems lately...

And I mean, wow, like,
really expensive...

So I'm a little short now.
What?

No, no, no, I understand.
I understand completely.

There's always public school.
Thank you.

Thank you so much.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
It's another beautiful day
on the Gold Coast.

24 degrees Celsius,
with perfect beach
conditions forecast.

Inland areas will experience
a late morning change...

With a storm front moving
in from the west...

Bringing scattered showers to
the hinterland and coastal
ranges.

Monday through Saturday.
Sundays can be arranged,
but at a higher cost.

I will, just as soon as he...

Good morning, sexy lady.
Thank you.

Sorry.

How are we today?

Do that great accent
that you do.

No.
Come on.

Just what we talked about?
No.

Hi, Mr. Roberts.

You're back... again.

Um, yeah, I wasn't
scheduled until 9:00.

9:00 o'clock,
it can't be 9:00 o'clock.

Ow, Jesus Christ!

You all right?
It's hot. Ow! Ow!

Do you want help?

Hey! Back... back up. Sit.

Never mind.

Is she mine?

Not today, mate, you've got
a personal... a Mr. Keller.

He's waiting out the front.

Mr... Keller.

Mr. Roberts.

You must be my 9:00 o'clock.

Indeed, I am.

Pleasure. Yeah.

Um...

I assume I'm a little older
than your usual clientele?

Oh, no, we get all kinds
if you can believe it.

I can.
Yeah.

So you're American.

Yeah.

Oh, we have something in common.

Yes, that's why I picked you.

Yeah, so, you've driven before?

Mm-hm.

Yeah, but I was, you know,
on the other side of the road.

Uh-huh.
In America, since I was 16.

Sure, good, all right.

Well, I think we'll probably...

Shall we...

Yeah, yeah, sure, sure,
I just need a signature.

Right here.
Right there?

Anything happens...

Mental, physical incapacity, no.

I can fill that out later.

That's good? Okay.

Yeah, thanks, Mr...
Thank you.

Okay, I don't have a current
address, just here on business
for the week.

All right.
Shall we, um...

Sure, sure, why don't we take it
out on the main road and we'll
see where you're at.

Yeah.
You've got a little experience.

Yeah, I do.

Sure, you have.

That's the windshield
wipers there.

Yeah.
One click up.

No, the other way.
Oh, shit.

Up, you just want to click
those up one more time.

I did. See? It's...
A little different.

One more time.
Click it up. There you go.

All right, why don't
you back it on up.

Then I'm gonna take you out on
the main street... whoa... uh...

Aren't we forgetting something?

What?
Seatbelt.

Oh, yes, of course. You know,
I never want to not keep
everything nice and legal.

Yeah.

Street legal, as they say,
right? Street legal.

Okay, pull her up ahead and...
All right, I'll...

Let's open this fucker up!

Easy now. Hold on, now we might
want to back off the gas
a little bit.

Ah, come on! I thought you liked
a little get up and go.

Whoa, now. You really need...
Please slow down.

Please slow down.
Residential neighborhood.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(HORN HONKS)

Hang on, let this guy go around.

Go where?
Go around.

Just let him go around. Don't
pull out in front of the...

You have to put
your seatbelt on.

Yeah, whoa, whoa,
you stay here.

I don't know what he wants.
I'm a little confused.

There you go.

Fucking dickhead!

Thank you!

Perfect, why don't we
hang a left up here.

I lost my pen.

Yeah, I think it's down
by your feet.

All right, now really,
we just want to take it easy.
Yeah.

All right, I want you
to pause here at the end...

And then hang a right, okay?
Hang a right. Other side!

(CAR HORN HONKING)

Man, other side! Other side!

(HONKING CONTINUES)

All right, good. Good.

No, no, no, you don't have
to put on the brakes...

But you're speeding...
There's a speed bump!

Speed bumps! Speed bumps!

Okay, oh, and slow down.
Slow down.

What I want you to do
is pause at the roundabout...

And go around the other side!
It's the other way.

The other way!
It's not... this way.

It's the other... what's that?
You liked that, did you?

You want to go around again?

(KELLER SIGHS)

Do you have the time?
No, I don't.

Yeah, you do.
It's a little after 9:00.

Please...

Can we... can we just stop
somewhere for a quick bite
to eat?

Are you hungry?
I'm a little bit rattled.

Can we just get a bite to eat,
a cup of coffee?

Come on.

May I have the keys, please?

Ow!

You can hand them to me
like a person.

So, Mr. Keller,
how'd you get my name?

This, uh, guy
tipped me off... Bill.

Bill? Somebody I taught?

He had b... brown hair.
Brown hair.

It's not important.
Hm.

You like driving
that golf cart out there?

Yeah, it's a living, sure.

Yeah? I wouldn't think so,
not after driving those
V8 supercars.

Right?
Excuse me?

You were a driver.

Yeah.

You were good. You were better
than most of the pack, right?

That's what I'm told.

Oh, yeah, I mean, I won
a few races, that's for sure.

Yeah.

Had a nice... nice, little run.

Yeah. Why'd you quit?

Oh, you know, I, um... had
a lot of responsibilities and...

Come on, man.
Gave up all that?

Well, you want to know
the truth?

Yeah.

I got a girl pregnant, and
married her and made a family.

Oh, the wifey told you to quit.

Well, we... she... we... we thought
that something might happen.

It's a dangerous job, and,
you know, you gotta grow up.

Everybody's gotta grow up.

Now you're a driving instructor?

Well, like I said, man,
it's a living. You know,
I provide a service.

Oh, come on! You're... you're
throwing away a dream.

That's a dream discarded,
in service of a selfish skirt
and a menial 9 to 5.

You were good, man!

It's not me anymore.

But your wife
is a selfish skirt?

I'm just saying, I would expect
you to argue that point first...

And you weren't quick to jump
to her defense.

That's all I'm saying.

Huh.

Hi, guys, was there anything
I could grab the two of you?

Yes.
Oh, no, I was actually...

No, no, no, my treat, a couple
coffees.

Two coffees, black.
Thank you.

All right,
won't be too long.

Thank you.
Yeah, yeah...

No, I'm just saying it's... I'm
curious, it makes me curious.

I'm curious, you're curious?

What... what do you do,
Mr. Keller? What kind
of work are you in?

Oh, I consult,
I work for the city.

Yeah, you work for the city?
What city?

Cleveland.

So you're here on vacation?

Sort of.
Uh-huh.

Just you seem to know
a lot about me.

Well, look, it's the internet.

Everybody's business
is everybody's business, right?

Yeah.
It's not everyday...

You get an Australian driver's
license, you get to meet a...

I mean, you could really
teach me how to drive.

Hm.
Right?

Is that what this is about?
Is that what you want?

No, I'm just a fan, you know.
I'm just a fan.

How much money
did you make back then?

I mean,
how much you making now?

You got a kid in private school
and you probably got a mortgage?

Wife's a lawyer, but she's
not bringing that kind
of scratch, right?

I just... realized I'm not
feeling very well.

What? No, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to...

I'm gonna go.
I didn't mean to be
personal at all.

Partner, don't be like that.
I just, you know, want to know
who I'm dealing with.

Who... who are you?
What do you want?

Oh, just want to, you know, get
my license, learn how to drive.

All right, I'll take you back to
the office, okay? They'll find
you another instructor...

Well, if that's the way
you want to play it.

You think, um, we could just
stop off at the bank
for five minutes?

It's not a taxi service.

Oh, I know, I have to cash
a traveler's check.

Mr. Keller, I, uh...
To pay you. To pay.

Yeah, that's it, right here.

I can't pull over here.
Yeah, you can.

I can't stop the car right here.
Just, just stop...

What the fuck? Hey! Hey!

Five minutes.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(CELL PHONE NOTIFICATION TONE)

(ALARM SOUNDING)

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

What the fuck!

Anyone, gun shots reported
on Chevron Island.

Fuck!

Drive, drive, drive!

Are you fucking kidding me?

Oh, my god!
What did you do?

What did you just do?

What did we just do?

You just robbed a bank!
That's a matter of opinion.

You robbed a bank!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

That is not technically true.

You're not gonna shoot me,
man. Are you?

Hey, I can't do this, pal.
I can't be involved. I'm gone.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

Hey, hey, hey! Help! Help!

What the fuck?

Goddamn it!

Why doesn't anybody
listen to me?

Drive, he said.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Cops are gonna shoot you down!

Cops are the last thing
we need to worry about.

We?

You better lose these guys!

Road block!
Hang on, asshole.

Whoa.

3 to base, we've lost them.
They're heading north
on Marine Parade.

Yeah, we've lost visual
contact, heading back
to Cat 11, standing by.

Okay. Run!
Take the money! Run!

Take the money and run, man!
Here! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Drive.

Cops! Cops!

Fuck! Goddamn it!

(HORN HONKS)

Very impressive, Mr. Roberts.
You see why I hired you?

You didn't hire me.
You kidnapped me.

Semantics.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Given the PE ratio,
is the market cap accurate?

What about undiluted EPS?
I don't see that here.

What's the current bid?

What about restricted
stock options?

Is there any reputational risk?
I want answers to these.

Excuse me, back in a moment.

Everything okay there, Marion?

Minor glitch.
I'll take care of it.

Okay, folks, let's focus.

There's a lot of money riding
on this, so let's try and get
it right.

Uh, security to base, there's
no sign as yet. Now sweeping
East Commercial Drive.

Where am I taking you?

We're gonna switch cars.

Yeah?
Take a right.

I shouldn't be involved in
something like this.

Will you just relax?
It's gonna be okay.

Really? Really? 'Cause it's
looking pretty fucked up from
where I'm sitting right now.

I gotta call my wife.

What the fuck? Hey! Hey!

You're gonna thank me
for that later.

What the fuck!
They can use that to locate us.

Fuck you!
You wouldn't like it. Trust me.

That's them up ahead.
Base, we're in pursuit.

Have you actually got a plan
or is this the world's
dumbest fucking crime?

You're my plan.
I invested in you!

Me, why?
Because you're a demon
behind the wheel.

You're a fucking race car
driver, man.

Couldn't you find somebody
who does this for a living?

What is there,
a shortage of criminals?

Cannot trust criminals. They're
untrustworthy in every way.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

All the bonds?
I'm afraid so.

From the safe?
Yes.

It could only be Keller.
Yes.

I want him dead
and whoever is with him.

Keep local law enforcement
out of it.

My friends on the force
have pulled back the net.

They're leaving him
to our security team.

Good, where are they?

Who are those guys?

They're like mercenaries.
Take a left.

Found them.

Security has engaged.

Let me know when it's dead.

Those aren't fucking cops, man!

I told you that, don't
you ever listen to me.

What the hell
kind of bank did you rob?

Well, they're not a bank,
in any recognizable definition
of the word.

I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you!

That's the spirit.

I'm gonna wring
your fucking neck.

Game time.

All right, hang on.

Oh, my god.

Jesus Christ!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Armed robbers raided...

The International
Bank & Trust this morning...

Shortly after it opened...

Taking an undisclosed sum
of money and getting away
in a car...

Yeah, Mr. Rossi?

ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Belonging to a driving
school. A witness said...

Yeah, I know, I realize that.

If you find them,
you need to tell me.

Because we need to be there.
Police presence and all that.

They resisted. Officers had no
choice but to bring them down.

Yup, okay.
We'll be here.

They get them?
Not yet.

Traffic cam says
they've headed north.

So we need to put our men
where they won't get in the way.

I've already taken care of it.

Good boy.

Shouldn't take long,
spot on back.

All right, listen up!

Now you all have your
assignments, yeah?

So let's get out there
and catch these bloody wankers.

Any idea who these wankers are?

[CHIEF INSPECTOR]
Who are you?

Agent Walker, Federal Police,
Major Crime Squad.

This is my associate,
Agent Brown.

This is a state matter.

Not anymore.

You see, The International
Bank & Trust are under
investigation...

For money laundering
and tax fraud.

Well, I don't know anything
about that, but this
is an armed robbery.

Pure and simple.
It's our jurisdiction.

I know who you are...
and what you are...

Chief Inspector.

From now on, you and
your men, work for me.


If you've got a problem
with that, I suggest you call...

Commissioner Rogerson
in Canberra.

I know he'd love
to hear from you.

All right... you're the boss.

You hear that?

Federal Special Agent Walker
is now in charge of this
investigation.

Now I want you all to give her
your full cooperation,
all right?

Let's get out of here.

All right, ladies and gentlemen,
what do we have so far?

You like it?

It's great.

Dual banger, overhead cam.

More your style, isn't it?

Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

Okay? Bullshit.

It's beautiful.

Get in, we'll try it out.

No, no, I'm not going.

Yes, you are.

Get in, partner.

You heard what I said,
I'm not your partner.

Get in the car.

Listen, I'm gonna walk
out of here, okay?

And there's nothing you can
do or say that's gonna change
my mind.

How about, try it
and I'll shoot you?

You're not gonna shoot me.

Well, I sort of have to,
otherwise you won't take
me seriously.

You shoot me, you're not
gonna have a driver.

I'll improvise.

Okay.
Get in the car.

Okay.

I can't get in the car.

Yes, you can.
No, I can't.

I'll explain it to you.

Gotta get out of here.
I'm turning around,
I'm walking out of here.

Roberts...
I'm sorry.

Roberts.
Hey, have fun in jail, okay.

Jesus! Ow! Fuck!

God, you shot me!

Yeah, I had to, you know,
that's the whole point.

God!
Why are you surprised?

I told you,
I'm about to shoot you.

What the fuck
did you shoot me with?

Rubber bullet, Russian 9
millimeter, self-defense.

I use it for when I'm mildly
pissed off. I use these
when I'm serious.

I can't... I can't feel my ass.

Well, it's supposed to hurt,
otherwise it's not a deterrent.

You think this is funny?
No.

Is that what this is about?
Man, let's go.

Let's... let's do it.
Let's do it. We're gonna do it.

Put 'em up, pal!
Put that rubber gun down.

Come on. Up.

Come on.

Jesus! Ow!

Come on, be reasonable, man.

You're a hostage.
You had no choice.

I put a gun to your head.

All you gotta do is get me where
I want to go and you're free
as a bird, you skate.

You're a maniac.

Hold on. Hold on.

Look, look, look, hey, hey.

Inside this case is $9 million.

You get me to where I want to
go, three of it is yours.

You got $9 million in that case?

Suddenly he's interested?
No?

How... who's gonna
believe me, huh?

Why wouldn't they believe you?

You're a solid citizen.
I cased you, man.

You got no criminal record,
no prior.

What kind of stupid
do you think I am?

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

I got a question. How do you fit
$9 million in that little,
black case?

Bearer bonds, bearer bonds,
my friend, right?

All right.
Just as good as cash...

Only easier to carry, negotiable
at any bank in the world.

Although I suggest you avoid
The International Bank & Trust.

And you're gonna give me
three of them?

That's what I said.

Huh, so I don't know, man,
but I didn't...

Don't ask any questions,
Mr. Roberts.

You're gonna be a rich man
if you just drive me where
I want to go.

No, no, no, I think I have
a right to know exactly what
the hell's going on...

Or at least part of the story,
or at least the courtesy...

Oh, I'll tell you the goddamn
truth. I'll tell you
the goddamn truth.

I owe you that. I owe you
that much and you're right
about that, all right.

A man I used to work with
is named Mario Rossi.

He's an American.
Sounds Italian.

He's not. He runs the Australian
end of an international crime
syndicate...

Re-banking ring,
here on the Gold Coast.

It's all very corporate
and very civilized.

You see, whatever money they
couldn't steal out of the U.S...

Whatever money they couldn't
put in their wallets or eat
or shove up their asses...

Well, they just had
to have more.

So they came here and bought
a few investment banks.

Okay, wait...
You following me?

You're talking about bad guys
buying banks like Merrill Lynch?

Like Bank of America?
Yeah.

So these rent-a-cops who were
trying to kill us back there...

You're saying work for the bank?

Yeah, they were corporate
assassins.

Bank assassins?
That's right. That's right.

And they... they want their
money back, obviously.

You're a brilliant man.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
they wanted their money back.

Okay.
$9 million is peanuts
to a guy like Rossi, right?

But these guys
are very old school.

They like to whack each other
over shit like that, right?

They're very thin-skinned
individuals.

No, no, no, they're very
sensitive, yeah, but that
doesn't explain...

You said that they owe you
money. How do they owe you?

Well, that's where
the story gets good.

You ever hear a
"Eye of the Fountain"?

No.

It's a diamond.
Yeah?

A big, fucking diamond that
used to be on display
in the Tower of London...

Until a wealthy Saudi
collector purchased it.

Rossi financed the operation
for me to abscond the jewel...

Which is worth a quarter
of a billion dollars.

Wait, wait, did you say
quarter of a billion?

Quarter of a billion dollars.
Dollars?

Yup.
Jesus Christ.

So you're a pretty good thief.

I'm an excellent one.

Now Mr. Rossi financed
the deal, then he set me up.

I had to do some time.

Well, I don't understand
why you even need Rossi
in the first place.

Why don't you sell it?

Because you can't just move
the Eye of the Fountain.

You know, you need connections,
uh, to do something like that.

Me, I just steal shit.

Anyway, I did some prison time.

I got out recently on good
behavior.

Here?
No, no, no, in America.

But this is the first time I've
ever been to the Gold Coast.

It's very beautiful.

Yeah, it's a lucky country,
all right.

We're headed north, partner.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Armed robbers raided...

The International
Bank & Trust this morning...

Shortly after it opened...

Taking an undisclosed sum
of money and getting away
in a car...

Belonging to a driving
school.

The suspect has been identified
as Peter Roberts, a driving
instructor for Drivers Wanted.

Police say Roberts and an
accomplice held up...

The International Bank & Trust
this morning...

And got away with an
undisclosed sum of money.

Both men are considered
armed and dangerous.

Tessa.
Lucy, it's a mistake.

Of course, it is.
It's a mistake.

You need to sit down.

No, no, I have to speak...
I have to talk to him.

Can I take you home?
Where's Rebecca?

Oh, my god.

Tessa!

Fuck, Peter, are you
out of your mind?

What have you done?

Where are you?
Call me.

Phoebe, just...
Just get it done, okay?

I was just about to call you.

Sit down.

You want to try to explain
to me what happened here?

Well, it's fairly simple.
Someone held up the bank.

And you have no idea
who these men are?

No. Why, should I?

I know you understand how
important it is...

That we resolve this
as quickly as possible.

I can assure you,
we have things well in hand.

And that nothing, nothing leads
back to me or the organization.

Do we understand each other?

That won't happen, okay?

Can I get you something?
Would you like a drink?

A drink?
I don't like you, Rossi.

I have never liked you.

Now I let them talk me into
putting you into a position...

Of more responsibility than
I thought you could handle...

And that was a mistake...
on my part.

I will make all of this
go away, all right?
You have my word.

Your word?

As if anybody's word ever meant
anything to anyone around here.

If I don't hear from you in,
say 24 hours...

I'll assume
you're no longer with us.

Did something happen to Daddy?

No, we're just going
on a little holiday, honey.

Did Daddy die?

No, of course not,
why would you say that?

Terrorists?

No, he's fine, Daddy's fine,
just get in the car, okay?

Mom?
Yeah.

Give me that.

Daddy robbed a bank.

No, he didn't, they just
got it wrong, okay?

Daddy robbed a bank.
Daddy robbed a bank.

Stop it!
He did not rob a bank.

Yes, he did.

He would never rob a bank.
Yes, he would.

Oh, my god.

Go!
Tessa, get out of here!

All right, now what we're doing
is we're gonna follow this road
north to Mount Tamborine.

We're just gonna stay
on the back roads,
observe the speed limit.

We're gonna keep a low profile.

Seatbelts. We should
put our seatbelts on.

Out here?

Well, if you're saying
keep a low profile...

I mean, the cops do come out
here at some point, right?

All right, all right.
They see us, they pull us over.

I'm putting mine on.

You know what? This is not
even fucking working.

I couldn't even put this
on if I wanted to.

I don't know, man, your plan's
falling apart, pal.

Cop sees us, we're not wearing
our seatbelts, this could
be a disaster.

No, don't worry about it.
We'll be fine.

I got this.

All right, so assuming
I do take your money, right?

Yeah, assuming.
Assuming...

How am I gonna spend any
of that money...

Your invisible money that
you've got, if I'm in prison?

You're not gonna go to jail.
I'm just wondering.

No, no, no.
Are you sure about that?

Yeah, you might get killed,
or we both might get killed...

But nobody's going to jail,
I promise.

How the fuck am I gonna convince
anybody that I'm a hostage here?

I got that figured out.

You mind sharing?

Yeah, it's easy.
We call the Feds, right?

And we tell them, you tell
them, "Hey, I'm a hostage.
I'm a hostage."

I got taken over.
This guy is totally psychotic.

In fact, we can do it
right now.

Uh, you know, pull over.
Now?

But let me get... let me check
and see if I can get a signal.

No.
Here?

No, uh, keep going.

Did my daddy really rob a bank?

You must be Rebecca, right?

Yup.

I'll tell you what, when we
get this all figured out...

I'll give you an official
briefing, okay?

Cool.
Go.

Can we sit down?

Sure.

Has your husband ever mentioned
the name Simon Keller?

Keller, no, at least
I don't think so.

Have you ever met this man
before?

I've never seen him before.

Your husband never
mentioned his name?

No.

Your husband used to
race cars, yes?

That's right.

And now he's a driving
instructor?

Part-time for what it's worth.

So, he wasn't bringing
in much money then.

That doesn't mean that he...

Your husband has been recorded
driving the getaway vehicle.

I know, I've seen some of the
footage, but there has to be
an explanation.

Look, I really shouldn't
be talking to you.

Mrs. Roberts, we're just
trying to help you.

You're trying to put
my husband in jail.

Right now, we're just
trying to find him.

Yeah, so you're on our side.

Mr. Keller is a career criminal,
Mrs. Roberts.

Your husband is in grave danger,
and if we don't find him...

If he calls you, I need you
to contact me immediately.

We'll see.

In the meantime, we'll assign
an officer to stay with you
at all times.

That won't be necessary.

I don't agree.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

What the hell is going on here?

Hey, hey, who are you people and
what are you doing in my bank?

Mr. Rossi, I presume.

I'm Agent Walker, Federal
Police, Major Crime Squad.

This is my associate,
Agent Brown.

What's going on?

This is a warrant. We're gonna
take a look at your books,
Mr. Rossi.

I don't understand.
Is this an audit?

You could call it that.

Fail to understand how our being
robbed would entail this
sort of thing...

But I assure you,
everything is in order.

Well, we'll see.

In the meantime, I presume
you've had a look at the
surveillance footage.

What can you tell me
about this man Keller?

Never met the man.
No idea who he is.

That's the way you want
to play it, fine.

We find him, I'm sure he'll have
a different story to tell.

When you do find him,
I'll be more than happy to
cooperate in every way possible.

When we do find him,
I'm sure you won't be around.

I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

No, of course, not.

All right, now we're gonna
call Major Crime Squad.

Good.

Right there on speed dial.
Just press that.

Oh, okay.
Hey, look, I'll do it.

Hold on.
I can do it.

No, I got it.

May I speak with someone
in Major Crime Squad, please?

Yes, I'll hold.

You serious? We're really
gonna talk to somebody
in Major Crime?

Yeah, they're gonna get
on the phone now.

What the fuck
am I gonna tell them?

You tell them you're being held
hostage. I took you at gunpoint.

I'm a psychopath.

So, the truth.
Yeah, tell them the truth.

Hello, hello, hi, um, yes.

Ah, my name is Peter Roberts...

And I am a hostage.

I'm a getaway driver.
I mean, I've been forced
to be a getaway driver.

That's why I'm calling, because
there was a bank robbery, yes.

Downtown, and then yeah,
so I was like, you know...

A driving instructor, right?
And I'm teaching this guy
how to drive...

Which he already fucking knows
how to drive, which, I figured
that out, by the way.

You got away,
you found the phone.

I found a phone.
I got away.

And I'm... wait, I'm having
trouble talking.

That's better... sorry.

What? Hey, whoa.
What? Hey!

What the fuck was that?
Fuck.

That was fucking garbage.

Yeah, sorry, I'm just
not used to this...

You didn't...
That was really overreactive.

Well, I have to destroy
the phone anyway,
it's a throw away.

You want to try that again?

You're the boss.

Okay.

Hello, may I speak with
the Major Crime Squad?

Yeah, hello.

Uh, yes, hi, my name is Peter
Roberts and I am the hostage.

I've been held hostage by a very
crazy man, a bank robber...

Who is really nuts, and he stole
my car. I'm a driving
instructor.

You probably heard about
this thing downtown.

I'm really... I'm really cold...

And I'm scared! I'm really
fucking scared that this guy...

Might blow my fucking brains
out if you don't come
and help me, okay!

I don't know where the fuck we
are! He's got me blindfolded.

Keep what?

Ow!

That was good.

Jesus fucking Christ!

I took the mag out, okay?
Nothing in the chamber.

You suck as an actor.

You almost killed me.
You know that?

I didn't kill anybody.
Let's go, let's hit the road.

I can't wait
to go back to school.

Everybody is gonna be
so jealous.

Becca, this is not something
to be proud of, okay?

But, Mom,
he was on television.

That is so cool.

Yeah.

(PHONE RINGS)

Hello?

Tess? Baby, hey.
It's me.

How you doing?

Where are you?

I'm... I'm on the road, honey.
How are you?

How's Becca? Did she hear
about what happened?

She knows, believe me,
she knows.

What have you done, Peter?

What have I...
Tessa, now wait a second.

Now you don't actually think
that I... I robbed a bank,
do you?

I mean, that's not...
You were driving the car.

No, no, no...
Honey, I'm a hostage.

The guy took me hostage.

I was giving him a driving
lesson and the next thing
I know...

We were being chased
by the cops.

This was Mr. Keller,
I presume?

No.

The Feds were here.

There's a cop in our house,
as we speak.

Oh, no, no, no,
I... Tessa...

Tessa, you can't trust
the cops, okay?

I don't want you
to tell them anything.

I want you to get the kid
and get out of there.

I'm not going anywhere,
Peter.

Tell me you
didn't rob that bank.

Honey, I did not
rob the bank.

I don't believe you.

What is there not to believe?
Give me that phone!

What the f... hey!

Was that Daddy?

She doesn't respect you, man.

She respects me.

No, she doesn't.

Yes, she does.

No, she didn't even believe you!
She didn't believe you!

I didn't believe you!
You sound like a pussy!

You want to know why
she doesn't respect you?

No.
Okay... forget it.

All right, why?

She doesn't respect you,
because you were a great
driver and you quit.

You were on the edge,
you were living on the edge...

And you were good at it,
and that's why she liked you.

And now, you gave it up,
and she doesn't respect you.

All right,
let me think about this.

Let's see, why did I quit?

Yeah, why'd you quit?

Oh, yeah, because she told me
to! That's why I quit!

Well, that's the first mistake.

You can't listen
to what they say!

They don't want you
to do what they say!

Unbelievable.

That's fucking, uh,
Woman 101.

I was in love with a Korean
girl, but she had the Han.

What the fuck is a Han?

Oh, it's this ancient kind
of thing with Korean women.

The women become like
Lady Vengeance.

They try to kill you,
and they can't help
themselves...

Because of years of oppression.

I didn't know going in,
and I learned a lot.

It's a cultural thing?
Yeah, yeah.

Hey, uh, where'd you
get this car?

I got this car
with money that I stole.

Well, you got ripped off.

What do you mean?

It looks like we're overheating.

Fuck me.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
The suspect has been
identified as Peter Roberts...

A driving instructor
from Driver's Wanted.

Police say Roberts
and an accomplice held up...

The International Bank & Trust
this morning and made off...

That's my dad!

Footage of the car chase
demonstrates...

Whoo-hoo!
Remarkable driving skills...

Of Roberts.

Yeah! Go, Daddy, go!
Whoo!

Jimmy Carter was President
the last time this car
has had an oil change.

That's it,
that ought to do it.

All right, here we go.

What the hell
are we gonna do here?

We wait for somebody to show up,
and then we steal a car.

Oh, another felony,
great, good.

Fucking legs, man.

Good afternoon, are you
here for the reception?

Yes, we are.

Well, you are early.

I know, I know,
do you mind if we wait?

Not at all, you can wait
in there if you like,
until your friends arrive.

You're very kind.
Turn yourself in.

We will turn ourselves in,
when we go to bed, sweetheart.

Um, anything you want,
you can just ask.

Perhaps a refreshment.

Thanks.

Feel free to steal whatever
you like, master criminal.

Just relax, Roberts,
and think what you're gonna
do with all that money.

Sorry, what money?

You'll get your cut.
Ah, right.

I'm a thief, not a liar.

I never stiffed a partner
my whole life.

How's that working out for you?

What?
Being a thief.

How is it to live like that?
Seriously.

What, as opposed to you?

You got balls, Keller,
I'll give you that.

But not much else.

Well, just because we're on
the run, doesn't mean we
have to live like savages.

Can I get you a Chardonnay?

No, no, thanks,
I'm the designated driver.

I got a question for you.
Tell the truth.

I always tell the truth.

Except when you're lyin'.
Yeah, except that.

How many people have you killed?
Hm? Murdered?

Wiped off the face
of the earth. How many?

Listen, man, you better
be careful with that
grandmother back there.

That look in that bitch's eyes.
The abyss is in there, man.

That bitch is bat-shit crazy.
Don't fuck around with her.

She's a nice, old lady.

Oh, you fool.

You don't trust a single
living soul, do you?

I find people, you know,
not that surprising really.

They're usually more inevitable.

Inevitably, they always
choose greed.

Poor guy... found out
life wasn't fair.

Oh, come on, fuck fair, man.
The game's rigged.

Guys like Rossi
suck guys like you dry.

He was on his way
to Davos, Switzerland.

You know the economic
forum there?

Apparently, they're finalizing
their plans to succeed from
earth to outer space...

With the rest
of the ruling overlords.
You're crazy.

The bastard was on a fast track
for a senior management position
at AIG...

And we just fucked up
his plans.

So, you know what?
That feels really fucking good.

All right,
you made your point.

So take his money,
money he stole.

Send your kids to college.

Do something for your wife.
You want to call your wife?

You want me to dial
the number for her? No?

Bloom off the rose,
is it?

I really don't like you.

That's what happens when you try
to be someone you're not.

What's that car doing out there?

Oh, they're here
for the reception.

Really, they'll have to wait.

I already told them that.
I know what I'm doing.

That'll be the day.

Oh, fuck off, prick.

Cunt.

Have you ever been married,
Keller? Hm?

Do you have any idea
what that might be like?

Yeah, once.

Really? Wow.

The masochism of women
never ceases to amaze me.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Armed robbers raided...

The International Bank & Trust
this morning shortly after it
opened.

The robbers made off with close
to nine million dollars.

Police, so far, have no clue
as to their whereabouts.

You must have been a real joy
to bring home to the family.

You probably stole all
the silverware.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say she dumped you. Right?

That what happened?

She died.

Fuck.

I'm sorry. Sorry.

She didn't die.
She went back to Korea.

I told you, she had the Han.

I couldn't handle that shit,
man, it was too heavy.

Fuck you. Fuck you.

Citizen's arrest.

Jesus Christ!
Greedy bastards!

Come back here,
you cowardly bastards!

(GUN FIRES)

You shit-for-brains!
You're gonna be jailhouse pussy!

I'm gonna make
buggers of you all!

You cowardly assholes!

Drop that gun! Damn it!

Roberts!

(HONKS HORN)

Go ahead and hit me,
panty waist!

Goddamn it!

Come on!

You're under arrest!

I'm gonna take you in!

Come on!

Motherfucker, that hurt.

Come on, come on,
come on, let's move it!

What are you fucking crazy?
Go, go, go!

I told you that bitch
was bat shit.
Motherfuckers!

(MUSIC ENDS)

That bitch is fucking crazy!

She's a tough old broad.

She fucking bit me.

What do you expect, what are
you even fucking around for?

She bit me
on the fucking back.

I told you, she had the Han.

She's 90-years old.

It doesn't matter,
it's fucking eternal.

It's eternal.

Hey, you want me to drive?

Yeah, sure, sure, of course,
that's what you're here for,
man.

Hah-ha! That's right, fucko!
That's right. Back up!

Back the fuck up and get
against the fence! Now!

You're gonna shoot me, Pete?

If I have to. I'll shoot you.

You're gonna shoot me
and take the money?

I'm gonna give your money back
to the people you stole it from!

They'll probably give me
a fucking reward!
I don't think so.

They're certainly not gonna
arrest me! I'm not the
bad guy here!

No, I don't think
I can let you do this.

You don't have a choice!

Everybody's got a choice,
brother.

I'm gonna count to five.
One.

What are you doing?

I'm-a countin' to five.

No, you're not!
Yes, I am!

You're gonna... this is
a loaded fucking gun!

Two.

Don't you make me do it.

Three!

I will shoot you!

Four!
Stop that! Stop! Stop!

Keller, this has got
to stop now!

Do not reach for that gun, man!
Don't do that!

Four and a half!

Don't make me do it, man!

Five! Yah-yah-yah.

Fucking asshole!

You gotta learn
how to count, bro!

See, she shot 'em all, at us.

Can we go?

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

I can't believe you would have
shot me over... over nothing.

What are you talking about?

You almost killed me.

When?
Three times!

All right,
but not on purpose.

What do you mean?

I mean, you got big ups
from this thing.

Don't pretend like it's not
an opportunity for you.

I... I got nothing from this
thing except for maybe ten years
in Sing Sing.

No, no, no.

You know, I'm still trying
to figure out...

How the hell I'm gonna convince
anybody that I'm a hostage...
situation.

I told you, I cuff you to the
wheel, I hit you in the face.

Wherever you'd like.

And you escape.

How many times do
I have to tell you?
With three million dollars.

No, I could either leave that
for you somewhere else or
I wire it to an account.

Come on.
It's not that complicated.

You're so full of shit.

How much further do we
gotta go here anyway?

100 miles.

Yeah.

We're gonna need gas.

Well, we're going in the right
direction... for gas.

You got it all figured out,
don't you?

Goddamn right,
every step of the way.


(SNORTING COCAINE)

(PHONE RINGING)

Rossi.

This is Dr. Henry Baskell.

Keller. Oh...

You'll never make it.

Oh, no, I think I will.
Wanna bet?

How about a little,
friendly wager?

Okay, okay.

So you wanted what was yours,
I understand...

But you took more than that,
Keller.

Call it interest...
five years' worth.

Look, I realize you're a little
upset with the way things
turned out, but...

You know we can
make it up to you.

So here's what I propose,
okay, guy?

How about this?

I take your money and you wind
up dead in the desert
somewhere...

Or quivering like a toothache.

What are you talking about?
What are you off your meds?

You know there's a certain kind
of animal purity you can only
have with a woman...

Who's fucked up,
and when I say fucked up,
I'm referring to your wife.

How is the little lady?

That anorexic piece
of jet trash.

What the fuck? Why you gotta
talk about my wife, Keller?

Your wife, you know what she
reminded me of? She reminded me
of a fetus with a slingshot.

What the fuck?

That's what she looks
like to me.
Come on, Keller.

You look like a dwarf.
She looks like a goblin.

Keller?
All right?

No, she looks like a hose beast.

A hose beast?
What the fuck is with you?

A hose beast.

That's a multi-tentacled demon.
Mythological.

Anyway, I know your love
is as pure as a cough drop...

But, you know,
she's a horrible witch.

And I fucked her and I would
have rather fucked anything
than her.

Is that right?

Well, how about you go
eat shit and die, asshole!

A little hard on cell phones,
aren't you?

Plenty more
where that came from.

All right, so that's the guy?
That's the guy who, uh...

Turned you into jailhouse pussy?

I kept my virtue... barely...

But yes, that's him.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Hey, uh, get some food,
water, maybe?

Thanks, Dad.
Get yourself a hat.

You want something to drink?

Yeah. Fresca.

(DOOR OPENS)

Sweet ride.

Thanks, she's not mine.

Will you fill her up
on pump number... number one?

Jesus!

I know who you are, mate.

Hold on, now, whoa.

Don't move.

Not moving. Come on now.

Take one more step
and you're dead.

I'm... I... uh...

He looks in, you wave to him.

You tell him to come inside.

You don't want
to bring him in here.

You do what I say.

Man, I'm telling you,
when he comes in here...

Very bad things tend to happen.

Well, I might just have to
reduce the odds then, ay?

(SHOTGUN FIRES)

No! Hey! Don't!

Come out, you little bastard!

(SHOTGUN FIRES)

Help! Uh, Keller!

Hey, Roberts,
you all shot up in there?

He's gonna shoot me!
He's gonna fucking shoot me!

Cheeky bastard!

Now it's you!
Now he's shooting at you!

Listen, I don't want
to kill anybody, okay?

So why don't you just put your
gun down and get down
on the ground...

And we'll just drive out
of here, okay?

You still got that
bank money with ya'?

Yeah, we still got it.

You bring me the money
and I'll let him go!

That's a good idea!

It's in the car.

All right, this is what
we do, mate.

Why don't you get the money
and the other fella stays here?

You bring me the money,
and I'll let you go.

Did you hear what I said?

Yes, we heard you and we are
doing it right now!

We got a deal or not?

Yes, it's a fucking deal!

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

Take it easy, buddy.

Hey! Come on, now!
You don't want to do this!

Jesus, come on!
Calm down.

Oh, shit, Oh, fuck!

Hey! Hold on!

Hey!

Okay... up, up.

Back up. Back up.

Now put the gun down, slowly.

Agh!

You shot him. Agh, goddamn!

You've shot him!

No, I didn't shoot him.

He shot himself.

Oh!

Fuck. Fuck!

God!

You stupid fuck!

Put her in jail, for god sake!

She should get life!

What happened?

Well, the car was stolen
and she's convinced...

It was the same two guys
who held up the bank
on the Gold Coast.

She ID them?

Yeah, thing is,
she shot at them.

She what?

Yeah, chased them through the
parking area and shot at them.

One of the rounds hit her
husband inside the winery.

I'm pressing charges,
she's a menace to society.

And that's why you cuffed her?

No, I cuffed her, because she
kicked me in the nuts.

Fiesty. Make and model of the
car?

Uh, yeah.
Um, Ford Mustang.

Shouldn't have any trouble
finding it.

And why is that?

It's got Star Trac installed.

Great. Thanks.

I'll set it up.

How long until we get
a fix on their positions?

We need to get within five
kilometers of them.

Walker.

Give me an address.

How far away is that
from where we are now?

Got it.

60 kilometers from here,
a petrol station.

This time somebody died.
Let's go!

Follow Walker.

You all right?

Just... first time I ever seen a
man killed like that, you know?

It was his own fault,
fucking dumb fuck.

How can you say that?
A man is dead.

Yes, I know, but, you know,
people die racing cars,
don't they?

It's not the same.

Well, you put yourself
at risk, shit happens.

The guy got greedy and stupid.

You know, I'm just a guy
trying to make a living here.

You're a thief,
people die around you.

No, no, he got greedy
and stupid.

How many people have you killed?

Zero! None! None!
How many? Come on!

He got greedy and stupid.

I don't think I can take any
more of this fucking crap, man!

You know what? You can keep
my three million dollars.

Fuck!

Fuck me.

You're right.

I'm right?

Yes, you are right.

I'm right?
You're right!

Now I'm right?
You're right, I fucked up.

I fucked this up.

It went bad, I'm telling you, we
gotta take you back to the gas
station.

Cuff you up, wait for the cops,
get out of this, go back
to your wife.

Go back to your family.

It's gone too far.

They're gonna try to pin
a murder rap on me.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

My family doesn't respect me.
Go back to your family.

You know that, you're right.

I'm not... I'm right?

I've got no respect
in that house.

My wife doesn't even look at me.
It's like I'm invisible.

You know?

Christ, she doesn't even
fuck me anymore, okay?

So, no.

Just go back home.

Fuck that.
No, I'll...

You know, you can look back at
our little adventure...

And hopefully, you know, have
a few chuckles, but it's best.

We're past the Rubicon line
here, man.

Keller, I'm gonna take you
to wherever the fuck it is
that you are going.

Okay, that's what I said
that I am gonna do...

And I do the things that I say
that I'm gonna do, all right?

That's something that I do.

But you never said you were
gonna do anything.

I'm saying it now!

I'm gonna take you to
where you're going.

I'm the driver,
you're the passenger!

Okay? From now on,
we do things my way!

And my way is,
I'm driving and you shut up!

Everything you say
is bullshit anyway.

Everything that comes out
of your mouth is bullshit!

Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

He always had a sense of danger
about him, you know?

He was a very dangerous man.

You know, not that I thought
he'd harm me in any way.

Quite the opposite.

He was very protective, but...

I always
knew that underneath...

He was very animalistic,
you know? Very primal.

surprised to learn he may
actually have robbed a bank?

No, not at all.

As I said, you know...

He was a very dangerous man...

And I loved him.

You were in love with him?

Well, yeah, you know, in a way.

I always thought we'd make
a good match and...

No more telly, hey?

That woman said she was
in love with Daddy.

She's made a mistake,
just a mistake.

Come on! Let's go play.

(DOOR OPENS)

I'll be back in a minute.

Get out!
Where's Rebecca?

Give me one shot of Rebecca
and I'll leave you alone.

Get off my property.
One shot. Oh, that's good.

That's good.

You bitch!
You ruined my camera!

Serves yourself right.

(STEPS APPROACHING)

I want him arrested.

Go inside,
I'll take care of this.

Sir, you've been trespassing.
There could be charges.

You know, I changed my mind,
I want to talk to my wife.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Can you just make it quick,
less than a minute?

They're listening, though.

(PHONE RINGS)

Peter?
Honey?

How you doing? You okay?

Where are you?

Where am I? I don't know
where the fuck we are.

We're close to the end,
I think. I mean, I don't know.

As long as nothing else
goes wrong.

Did you fuck her, Peter?
Did you?

Wait, what? Did I what?

That secretary, whatever she is,
that snotty, little bitch
you like so much.

Um, yeah...
yeah, I fucked her.

Yeah, I fucked her every day
for the last three months.

Yeah, it was fun, too,
and her sister.

Peter, what happened to us?

Of course, I didn't fuck her.

What are you talking about?
I mean...

If I recall, I haven't fucked
anybody in about six months.

Or am I missing something?
Yeah, that's right, FBI guys...

That's right, yes, I'm talking
to my wife here about fucking.

If you don't mind, maybe you
could turn off the tape recorder
for a second...

While I have a private
conversation!

Is that okay?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know
this is all my fault somehow...

But, Peter, robbing a bank?

I didn't rob a fucking bank.

Really? I mean, I want to
believe you, but...

Christ almighty god, honey,
I don't... I don't know...

What... what the fuck do you
think I'm doing here, huh?

I don't know, I don't know
who you are anymore.

You know why?
You know why?

Because I'm invisible,
that's why.

Because nobody respects me
in that house.

Nobody even
pays attention to me.

I mean, this is the most
attention I've gotten
in six months!

This is actually kind of fun.

Peter, just come home.
Things can change.

I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

This is a bad time to talk
about this, you know.

The FBI is listening
on the other line.

Um, I gotta go.

You have a home, come home.

Anyway, I love you.

Don't go!

Goodbye.

Did she buy it?
Can I throw this?

Yeah, yeah, get rid of that.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

So, who's our friend?

This is the man
that worked here.

So he was killed
by the suspect?

Well, security video
actually shows him...

Trying to kill these two
other guys with a shotgun.

Well, it looks like
he shot himself.

(PHONE RINGING)

Mr. Rossi.

Yeah, we're there now.

No, apparently they
shot someone.

Yup, all right, let me know.

All right, stay with her.

This is bullshit.

Rogerson's on to us.

He's got his Feds all over this.

I've got fucking kids, mate.

Fuck Rogerson, fuck the Feds
and fuck your kids.

I mean, you think I'm gonna
let this bitch bring me down?

You are either in,
or you're out.

Follow them.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Keep it slow, mate.

We got him.
How far?

About four and
a half K from here.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Mr. Rossi, looks like he's
doubled back to the Gold Coast.

I'll have a helicopter
standing by.

Yeah? What's up?

Okay, we got 'em located,
let's put a team together,
your best people.

Okay.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)


Bugger!

What should I do?

Don't antagonize 'em.

Fuck you!

Nah, fuck this.

Did you really have to do that?

I need a drink.

What?

A drink.

Here.


No, no, no.
I need a drink.

Roberts.

I'm sorry about what I said
about you being a pussy.

You know, having no heart
and no balls, all that shit.

Sorry, okay?

Mm-hm.

Are we straight?

Yup, we're straight.

You understand that we
cannot stop for a drink.

That's an impossibility,
cannot happen.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ah, I think I'm gonna
wait in the car.

You're not coming?

No, too many dangerous
creatures in there.

But, uh, you got the guns.

I feel safer in here.

Barkeep... tequila,
make it a double.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Well, well, well.

Oh, no.

Hey, fellas.
How you doing?

Buy you a drink?

How about you?

Not thirsty, huh?

Ah, shit.

Let's see if you can dance
better than you can drive.

I... I don't really dance...
for an old fella.

(GUN FIRING)

Jesus Christ! Get... Ow!

Dance!

Fuck!

Dance! Shit!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh, I'm sorry.

I just... I get a little
carried away when
people shoot.

Goddamn it!

Stupid bitch!

Oy, that's my girl, dickhead!

You bitch!

What do you say, gents?
Call it a day?

Now, I know I don't
want to shoot you.

And I'm pretty sure,
you don't want to shoot us.

(PHONE RINGS)

Who's fucking phone is that?

Yeah.

Is everything taken care of?

We're taking care of it
right now.

Fucking hell!

I think they're gone.

Ah-ha ha-ha!

This is all your fucking fault.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Give me the keys!

Okay.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

How do you want to handle this?

When I get up close,
I'm gonna spread 'em out.

Don't leave me on the asphalt.

All right, you just do
your job, I'll do mine.

I don't care.

Excuse me a minute.
Give me that fucking thing!

Give it to me!
Hey!

Thank you.

Fuck you, motherfucker!

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

Give me 100 yards.
100 yards!

(MUSIC ENDS)

Come on, let's go!

How's it feel?

Feel better. You?

Feel better?

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Take a left.

He's turned.

Pick up the pace,
come on.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Come on, come on.

What are our chances
of getting through this thing?

Fifty-fifty.

Shit.

Bingo.

Mr. Rossi, the only thing
around here is Rudy Maas Marina.

Must have a boat stashed there.

All right, guys, look.

I don't want him dead,
just yet.

I want him available for...
punishment.

He coming up on us?
Yeah.

All right, what's the plan?

Uh, you're my plan.
I told you that.

Hey, here they come.
Come on, punch it.

All right, I'm ready!
Punch it! Okay.

Shit! What was that?

dock, pull over, let me out.

I'll lose them, you double
around back and I'll meet you.

I don't understand what
the fuck you're talking about.

Ready?
Yeah!

(ENGINE TURNING OVER)

Ah, shit!

Let's do this.

Don't shoot!
Don't you fucking shoot!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Go, go, go, go!

Come on, you guys.

Yes, I'm dealing with it. Now
you deal with this, all right?

It's a 250 mill muni bond. You
get 3.75 for papering the deal.

150 to 175 bips is the play
here, you moron.

Don't insult people.

If you don't want to play,
I'll take my money to Enrico.

I'll have it before you wake up,
and go fuck yourself, Larry...

Because that's all
you're gonna get.

Yeah, my cock up your ass.

I'll call you back, Larry.

You don't need to do
anything rash, all right?

You don't need to kill me.
No, no, no, no.

It's the Buddha who said, "To
change the course of evil
in a foul and putrid river..."

"Is in itself an evil thing."

I'm paraphrasing, of course.

Shit!

What the fuck is this?

You know my favorite story
about the Buddha?

It's the only one I know,
actually.

Son of a bitch!

There was a local monastery...
Okay.

But it had fallen into
disrepute.

So the local monk knows this is
a totally fucked up situation.

Yeah, it's a very fucked up
situation, Keller.

He doesn't know what to do,
because he's looking around...

And it's filled with treacherous
whores and liars and thieves.

That's Walker.

And cocksuckers everywhere.

No disrespect to cocksuckers,
you know.

Agh! Goddamn it!

So, he goes up to the local
sage, a man who's achieved
enlightenment...

And he says to him, "What do I
do? This fucking place is a
whorehouse..."

And it's filled
with greedy bastards."

Hell of a place to break down.

Yeah, hell of a place.

What are you doing,
Inspector?

I'm just clearing up loose ends.

And they should all be round up
and chained to a trash heap
in Australia...

And be allowed to feed only on
the local vegetation.

What the fuck is this, Keller?

See, you traced them,
they ambushed you.

Just fucking let me go,
Keller!

You want to fuck with me? Hah!

You fool, don't you realize that
the reason you failed...

Is because you didn't know that
the Buddha was living amongst
you the whole time.

Nobody knew who the Buddha was.
Nobody knew what to do.

(ENGINE REVS)

Mate, it's one thing taking
money under the table.

But killing one of our own...

Stupid bastard.

So they all treated each other
with compassion and kindness.

And the monastery was returned
to its former glory.

(GUN FIRES)

Ow!

You and that cankerous fucking
wife didn't want children
anyway, did you?

Oh, fuck.
Consume the truth.

Hey, are you all right?

You think she loves me?

No.

I was hoping you'd say yeah.

I don't think she does.

But I think she's gonna
learn to respect you.

Just one guy's opinion.

I've been shot.

I know, that explains
the hole in your arm.

But you're all right.

I have a hole in my arm.

Yeah, but you're all right.

You know what?
I am all right.

Ow.
Oh, sorry.

Fuck.
Here, put that on.

No, no, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

Okay, put it right to the wheel.

Yeah, put it right to the wheel.

(DISTANT POLICE SIRENS
WAILING)

Ah, listen to that...
the cloister bell rings.

Think you're gonna make it?

Fifty-fifty.

Hell of a ride, huh?

I still don't like you.

I know.

Hey, where do you want it?

Want what?

You gotta make it look good.

I've been shot.

Do you want to go
to jail or not?

Look, I'm just trying to help.

Look, you want to risk it,
risk it. I don't... it's whatever
you want, man.

It's... it's... I don't have
no dog in this fight.

If you're gonna punch me,
just...

God... damn it!

Oh, that hurt.

Look at us.

Here we are, sirens coming.

And nine million dollars.

Hey, you want me to leave it
somewhere or wire it
into an account?

No.

No, I don't.

If you change your mind,
let me know?

I'll look you up.

Okay.

I gotta run.

Hey, Keller.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

For god sakes, for what, man?

I'm sorry for shooting
you in the face.

Well, you didn't shoot me.

I know, but if it was loaded,
I'd have shot you.

I'd have pulled the trigger.

You did pull the trigger.

I did pull the trigger...
and I'm sorry.

I know, it's gonna take
you a while to...

These things, you know, you
don't get over it right away,
it takes time.

It's been a hard drive,
you know?

(POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING)

(SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES)

Mr. Roberts.

Is this what they mean
by domestic bliss?

How's your arm?

It hurts.

I'm not surprised
after last night.

Well...

Aren't you gonna ask me
where it hurts?

Daddy! Daddy!
There's someone out front!

Jeffries.

Roberts.

Talk to me, pal.

I wanted you to see it
before we took it to the track.

I see it. I see it.

V8, 450 horsepower,
ventilated Brembo brakes.

Six-speed sequential.
Yup.

Safest car on the market.

Yeah, look at that roll cage.

Safe as house.
Yeah.

Look at the roll bar
in that baby.

I mean, that looks safe.

I don't like it.

Why? Are you... are you afraid
that I'll make more money
than you?

Huh?

And now I'm afraid
that you might die.

Oh... so she...
She cares about me.

She likes me.

She loves me.
She loves me.

If she loves me,
she'll let me drive.

I love you.

Vroom, vroom.

Dad! Teach me to drive!
