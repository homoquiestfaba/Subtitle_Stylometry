Hi, you called Jude and Celia.
We can not answer now.

Leave your name and number
that will call later.

Drugs.

Marinated in a wine garlic sauce...

Hello.
What goes in a salad?

Is making salad for him?
And I am.

Why?
Well, because I asked...

What he wanted and he said he had lunch
late...

That was too hot to cook.

Spake: 'Why does a light salad...'

and I'll bring the wine?'.
I said, 'Fine.'

But you do not eat salad.
I know.

Well, now will have to eat salad.

Yeah, I know. I put?

Expected, how old he is older?

Are 17 years.
've Talked about it, Shelly.

I need...
How many meetings have been?

Ones 10, I think.

We worked together for three months when
he was a consultant that project...

So we know well.

No more questions, I want to help.

I like it...

Yeah, me too.

It is fabulous.
I wanted to make a salad for him.

Buffalo Mozzarella, lettuce...

Bread, olive oil, vinegar, basil,
garlic, salt and pepper.

This is a caprese salad,
think I can do.

And he has the most
17 years of experience in bed?

Yes, he has.

I love you.
I love you too.

BETWEEN WINE AND LOVES (2007)
Legend: @ ARR ZZO.

She has another meeting with that guy.

Who?
The Lily.

The older guy?
It is.

I thought you liked him.
I like it, it's just that...

He is much older.
This is too much.

You see nothing wrong with
the age difference?

She likes him?
Yes, it's ridiculous.

She calls him 'Knight in Shining Armor
,' 'Mr. Wonderful'.

All that crap.

It is not with the crap that
every little girl dreams?

Love.

So is saying that she is happy.

Well, it is, but...

So what's the problem?

Nevermind.

Look, he's a guy of 47 years.
With a writer hot 30...

Career about to take off.
And who needs her space...

So she gives to every guy who comes out.

That man will lick the floor at her feet.

Actually, bet he licks.

Love, I'm serious.
I'm also serious.

I think it's perfect for her.

You do not know.

No, but I know her.

And she never brought it here to
give a person the least of her.

Much less make her happy.

In addition, it is the combination not age.

And these two together.
I feel it.

As you and I, Shelly.

Where's the phone?
Why?

I'll do something nice for us.

What?

I'll order a pizza.

What? No.

What is Shelly?

If I stayed in the kitchen
and learn with me...

Would do this together.
Would be much better.

I just got home from work.
Me too.

I do not like to cook.

But I like it. Strive to me.

Like to cook?
We will have a baby.

Someone has to start to enjoy cooking.

You make great salads.
We can eat a salad.

Hey, where are you going?

Ask your damn pizza.

Hi - Hi.

Health.

Wait.

If you do eye contact, bad luck.

It?
Seven years of bad sex.

I did not know it.
No?

It was good to know each other then.

What if we had not known?

It would have been a great tragedy.

Saved my life, thank you.

What a delight.

Nebbiolo.

I love it.
Good.

Thank portrazer.

And then?
And then?

Have you ever been married?

No.
And will you marry?

Pardon me?

Do you want to get married?

This is a request or a question?

It's a question.

Okay, okay. Good..

I want. Is, yes. I want to.

I mean, it depends.
Not have to do with marriage...

Do not have to happen.

I'm not dying of desire to marry.

If it happens, it will be cool.
If not, okay.

I just want serfeliz and enjoy life.

Why do not you married?

It's out of fashion.
What does this mean?

Everyone is divorced.

Not everyone who divorces.

Divorce, fill and move on.

Not in a real marriage.

Ah, yes.
No.

Here. And women...

Betray them as much as men.
In fact, even more.

There are statistics.
Just talking about it...

Because we are in Hollywood.

Normal people who live out here...

Stay together more than 5 minutes.
Normal people cheat.

There are a few that last.
Has Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn.

And Cameron Diaz used to be a singer...
and that.

But that ended. That's it.

They do not even married.
And I bet betrayed.

Okay, you have problems.

I? I have no problems.
Oh really?

I've tried many things in life
, but were in the past.

People betray and lie.

Reality I know more now than before.

Is that right?

What does this mean?
What you do not want to marry?

Do not querter
a monogamous relationship?

No. I mean I think marriage is outdated.

Right.

How many bottles did you bring?

2.
Great.

Think you can?
Here's 5 minutes...

And we are already in marriage.

Shall I go back to the store?
No.

Not yet.

It's all you have?
It is.

That's all?

It. I do not like salad.

Do not eat salad?
No.

Why not eat salad?
I do not know.

So why do we have salad for dinner?

Because you wanted a salad and
is too hot to cook.

And I thought it was time to
get used to eating salad.

I should... eating salad.
Good, but was for your good...

Not because of me.
No, not because of you...

Is one thing I wanted to start eating
. Your request cheered me up.

Okay. So we have a caprese.

Let's see, what you dislike?

What I like is the bread and cheese.

That's it? No...
And pepper.

And pepper?

So with all these things you
not like, what will we do?

I do not know.

Let's see. Let's make a...

Salad Lily.

Okay, but I am very sick.
I know.

It basil?

Tenho.

Great. And is it cool?

I think you need to think about it.

It is the seventh month of pregnancy and
everything seems much bigger than it is.

No, not that.
I'm not one of those pregnant...

Who is freaking out the whole time.

True, but is not it this time.

Ok, then what is?

That's all.

'All' has to do with everyday things?

It.
Has much to do with everyday life.

Always have. And now has to deal with it
being pregnant.

This is not fair.

But the reality is.

Try this one.
Our.

Oh my God.

My God.

You see that?
That's the problem.

What? A good bruschetta?

I can not cook.
So learn.

I'm trying.

But Chris does not participate.
He acts like a sexist.

I think he just did not bother to cook.

Do you want to mount the cradle
and paint the baby's room?

No.

But he wants, right?
Yes.

This is the part of it.
Cooking is yours.

People are what they are, Shelly.

We can change that, but
generally do not change.

Okay, while being honest with you.

Needless to say this to you.
No.

By the way, cooking is not for me.
I'm not good at it.

I bought all these books idiots, but I'm not...

No idea what I'm doing.
So do not come naturally...

DNA I do not have to do it.

Look at you. Not not paying attention.

What are you doing?

I watch the I like to eat, then I do.

Everything has to do with combining
things. It's like your clothes.

Nice combination, indeed.
Thank you.

It's the same thing.
Can you teach me some tricks?

Can each cooking 2 times per week.

It'll be nice.
Do not you care?

The Celia did not really enjoy
cooking, it is always shooting.

So it might be fun.

You are so lucky.

Why?
Because you're a lesbian.

What?
Women are much more...

Tune with their emotions.

Sure, it's a way to see things.

But it is true, no?
I mean, she comes home...

Tells us about her day.
You count as yours.

You have much to talk about what
and vent, if needed.

Or get excited. I ask Chris...

As his day and he said 'Great.' That's it.

But this is not bad, huh?

Well, you and Celia
share every detail with one another.

They are lovers and best friends.

This is what we are.
Best friends and lovers.

I love it.
Okay, so you like the idea...

...2 women competing
to vent at the end of the day...

While a guy is just there listening?

It.

This is called estrogen.

Best friends and lovers
are important roles...

But that does not make our relationship
nothing ideal.

I think so. At least you
she hears and understands you.

Yeah, right.

Hello.

Speak of the devil...

What are you doing?
Here I am cooking with Shelly.

Have you finished?
No.

Any predictions?
They just bring pizza, then...

Will take a while.
3 hours at least.

Okay.

I love you.
Me too.

More bruschetta?

Thank you.
Sure.

How is the wait?
I do not care if it takes.

I like the team.

So, how is to stay here
hidden in the corner?

Yeah, but I think it has to do
be honest with you...

With yourself and with others about
what they are doing together...

And how they feel real.

Marriage is a relationship only
you already have.

Marriage is just a celebration of this act.
And make it official.

It is a legal documentation,
then in that sense...

I would like to be a real marriage.

This is something that is not
strength, just happens.

Or not.

I can do without the drama of
marriage, all the crap...

But qualquerforma,
I believe in love.

And I love jewelry.

I'll keep that in mind.
It should.

Have you lived with someone?

Almost.
Ended up changing my mind?

No. We were in the house a
the other almost every night.

I was there and she had things
things in my house.

This is not living together.

We had the same house, but
we lived our lives together.

Yeah, but that's the fun part.
Mean...

Live together is to divide
the space in the closet...

Undertake to paint the wall,
accepting a mobile ugly...

Yes it is to live together.

Do you have experience with this?

Oh, God. I have.
More than once?

Four times.
4 times?

It.

I do not know what I was thinking of none.

I was in love?

Everyone had bad habits.

There were bad men, but I do not
should have gone live with them.

I was very insecure about men
when I was younger.

Why was it unsafe?

I do not know. But thought it had to be...

In a relationship to be happy.

And now when I look at my 20 years...

The time that I was not happy, or when
was...

These relationships that
I thought I needed...

But I did not need.

But did it anyway.
I did.

I was young.

I was a girl of 20 years extremely dramatic.

Now What?
I'm in my 30 and love it.

Why?
It is much easier.

I mean... It is what it is, but...

I know very well what I want
and I know what I want.

And I'm not afraid of two things.
Life is life.

Ah, is it? Life is life?
Is the key to you?

Yes Were you surprised by that?
Well, a little.

Generally have a little more than that.

With most women,
the big decisions of life...

Or is the answer to everything
or the end of the world.

It seems to be generally so.

I was that way.
Then one day, gone.

Do not know if it's because I'm
more comfortable with myself...

Or if I woke up one day...

And was tired of living like this...

But the two forms,
is a good thing.

It's very good you will not be afraid.

I have my moments, but also
is not the end of the world.

Like what?

What kind of time you have?

Frightened you?
No.

It was only a question.

Okay.

What kinds of moments I have?
What scares you?

Bad judgment.

It happens.

Yeah, but usually you is not the only
person who pays the price for it.

It's part of life.

I think so. So what scares you?

Nothing.
Nothing?

Nothing.
What is, must have something.

Well, actually...
salad dressing ready...

Freaks me out.
What.

Well, come on.
Get down from there.

What will you do?
You'll see.

Go do something from scratch, is not it?
No, we will. Together.

Lemon. Is the right thing.

The right thing?

It is the right thing.

I wish he lend more attention. I'm...

Pregnant, married, live in an apartment.

Work at a movie studio
doing absolutely nothing creative...

Just creating excuses
's why I'm taking the day off.

I should be building movie sets...

And living in a house with a pool.
I do not know how I got here.

Well, you made the choices that brought
here.

Are you really so unhappy with them?

No. I just do not know what I'm doing.

What are you afraid of?
At the moment, to win over 1 kg.

Whatever you're doing,
smells amazing.

I know that cheese has enough stuffing to
a horse.

Well, the cheese is good for the soul
and the small bones.

So what if gaining weight 7 Kg?
8 Kg.

What seem to eighty.

, but are not.

Well, I can no longer see my feet.

The baby will love it here.

How is your cholesterol?
Low.

Really? Impressive.
I do not know why.

I think...

Terrifying the fuck is Chris.

In what way?
Of all the ways.

You know, I always start.
And he never.

And I want, but the more
I do, I do not like so much...

The way I think you should like.

Why do you think he does not like?

I know he is not.
Well, does it end?

Yes, but that does not
mean anything to a man.

What is it?
I think you have...

To give him time.
No, no.

Look, I think you need a while and he also.

Why?
Why is your 1st pregnancy...

You're pregnant, it is the 1st
his experience, his is the 1st...

I'm sure he's a little more lost than you.

Think about it. If
Celia puts his hand on her belly...

I feel the baby kick and 1 hour later...

She puts her hand a few inches below
for one thing...

Completely different would be very strange.

This is not helping me.
But that's life.

I know, I know what life is.
But nothing like that.

I do not think he looks more to me
the same way he looked.

You'll have the baby and return to settle
midnight on the roof quickly.

You know that?
We got you there.

Oh my God.

Okay,
were there for the same reason.

You'll be fine.

You'll have a baby?

I think I'll wait a bit.
But let's be great babysitters.

I do not know if we will.
What is happening?

Honey.

Do you think he is cheating on you?

No...

I think not yet.

That's it. And pepper, of course.

Yes.

Yes.

Why did not live with her?
Who?

The girl spent all the time, he was at home.

Why not.
Why?

It was not what we were doing.

Why?

We wanted different things.
So why were they together?

Because we liked each other.

Even though it would not in any way?

Do not know it would give
somewhere or not.

It was nice for a while and then
was no more.

Okay.

Are avoiding anything with all this talk?

No.

Wow, that's fine.
See?

No, it is delicious.
You look so surprised.

I do not like sauce ready.

Do not ready this nonsense.
This is not salad dressing.

This is much better.
This is the right thing.

So why not believe in marriage?

Why are you worried if
sure that nothing is happening?

'Cause everything is different
now and it has back.

I'm not the girl whom he married...

And he is not the guy I married.

I will be mother of his son.
And it will be the father.

Yeah, and it's beautiful. It growth.

Do you want this baby, Shelly?

I want this baby more than anything.

It's just that this thing is not
Mother's sexiest phase of my life.

And I do not think he will again be
the way it was before.

Okay, things are a little different.

But this is not so bad.

Not totally, but...

Mothers climb on the roof and
have sex under the stars.

Who said that?
The baby said, I think.

For this there nanny.
What is. You really think so...

A man will look a woman the same way...

After seeing a baby go through
the same opening tiny...

That until then it was the Holy Grail?

I could have my body back,
whole damn good, in one week.

Could tiny red panties...

A black stilettos, but for him,
I'll still be a 'Mom'.

I'll never be his wife beautiful and sexy
him again. Over.

I think you're exaggerating.

I'm not.

You have this whole thing lesbianism.

I'm serious.
Women are more complex.

We need more than a stiff butt
to be impressed.

We prefer content.
Speak for yourself.

Gracinha.
I'm kidding.

That is, more or less.
Just think that is out of plumb...

Hormones are taking over.

I know my hormones are crazy, I know.

But I'm trying to be realistic. That's it.

Men always have a midlife crisis...

And go for the younger
woman. Do you know?

They want to like you as a mother.

At first they try
but it is a fight that can not win.

They are old and distinguished
and before we know it...

Has a new girl and sexy. And with the right
smile across the room...

This marriage was already.
Not only because of her age...

But because she does not have the
baggage of wedding or baby bag.

She has the whole world in front of her.

And all she wants is someone who
be around long enough...

To celebrate with her all the things she did.

Easy. And yet, she loves him.

If I were a man,
I would want the same thing.

Look Lily and this guy down.

He is 17 years older than her.

17.

And he is Photo-Journalist
portodo and travels the world...

Doing God knows what,
with God knows who...

.

You know, in my understanding
he is not married, no children...

And as he goes around the world...

He sends cards and flowers
when not in Los Angeles.

And she's happier than
never seen her with a man.

I think has more than one way to look at it.

It has.

What is it?
I do not believe we're having...

This conversation.
Oh, please.

With what they have going on?
'Papaizão' or not.

How not to speak of them?

I'm not talking about them.
But what are they doing?

What is happening down there?

Why do you care what they are doing?

You need a little flour.

No, I do not need.
Yes, you need to.

...I do not need.
I'll be back in a minute.

Shelly, you can not... - 5 minutes.

Hi, I'm Shelly from above.

Of course, since we met.

I came to get some flour.

We're doing a roast and over.
Oh, and what are baking?

Some cookies...
Hi.

Hi. I need to flour.
So, how are you?

Well, thank you. And you?

The baby is to soon?

2 months. Thanks for asking.

You have children?
No.

Yeah... But you querter?

Querter a family?
Want to take root?

It's flour, you say?
Yes, just one cup.

You think you could
handle a pregnant woman?

Hey.

I just wonder why Lily said
you never married and...

That's it.

It's just a cup.
Take the whole package.

You better go, before something burn.

But...

Right. We should
dinner together next week.

A dinner would be great,
can I travel...

Next week.
But when I get back...

Ah, travel... Again.

Okay, let Lily score.

Bye, Shelly.
Right.

Have fun with the salad.

Okay.

Excuse me.
No need to apologize.

It's a concerned friend.
It's a bomb of hormones...

Who is bored with his life
and therefore gets the other.

Do not worry.
Thank you.

Wine?
Yes, wine.

The wine will be the answer for everything
tonight.

There is nothing wrong with that.

Oh my God. I hope not.

Of course she is angry, but...

Already, then let it go.
Apologize tomorrow.

But I just...
Do you have...

More serious issues to resolve
than worrying about Lily?

Look, you know,
am very worried...

With everything you just told me
about you, Chris, and this little baby.

Why? Because it is a harsh reality?

Not because it is crazy.
Really?

Hi - Hi.

Forgot your screenplay.
I know.

See you tomorrow.
Wait.

In a hurry?

The studio sent it.

Only one cup?

Well, the bottle is opened.

Accept a drink.

Okay, I thought.

Marriage. A close union,
a combination...

Mating, marriage.
Is this it?

The dictionary provides
definition, not opinion.

So marriage is
what you think is the definition.

Sure So, what do you think?

In this definition?
It is.

I think it's very good.
So you...

Believes it is possible a relationship?

I guess anything is possible.
You know what I mean.

Listen, can not make a relationship...

Something that is not.
Will be what it is, no matter...

What you want it to be.
That's what I'm saying.

But the marriage is over.
But that's what marriage is.

No, society has changed this definition.

Marriage is about terms and
conditions, rules and laws.

Do not you believe it.

Then why else would marry?
You would not, that's it.

Marry and be in
marriage are different things.

That's what I think.

Marry, I do not care in any way.

But the idea of being in a marriage, I like.

A real marriage,
that's the truth.

Are you saying you do not want to marry.

I'm saying that the only
word that represents...

Something I want to be, is 'Happy.'

And when I say I am happy,
I really want to say that.

Because if not, I'm out.

What is it?

Think we should open the 2nd bottle?

Absolutely.
Great.

Noticed which basically is saying
that every woman who gives birth...

Is destined to be betrayed
or exchanged for another woman?

No, not every woman.

That is, some homes
think of different ways.

It's just that if they act so or not...

Everyone wants a girl young and carefree...

Has a perfect body and a constant smile...

As the guy who is with Lily...

He just wants a piece of ass
20 years younger than him.

I think is a bit more than that...

But I mean, right or wrong,
is a chance that Lily has.

I just do not think she
want to see him as he is.

And you do not give him the
benefit of the doubt, I mean...

Does not matter, why are not you
that is down there with him.

Spoke to someone about it?

Who? What?

Do you need help.

I know, that's why 'm talking to you.

Well, you began to speak when
her husband asked pizza.

I think I need professional help, I mean...

At least go see your OB...

And see if it's a phase normal pregnancy.

It's normal.

These are all normal things,
that's what I'm worried.

You know, that's not what I meant.

It.

What about you?

For my what?

Well, already been tried?

With what?

You know what. I mean, even
is why we are here?

You think I'm projecting?

Designing? Well, it better be
reading self-help books.

I'm not projecting.

Okay.

You are attracted to someone?

Drugs.

You are.
No.

Oh, shit.

Okay. They are only their
hormones are crazy.

I not only thought about it. I did.

'Oh Damn' is really the answer
right here, right?

The hormones are...

There are hormones.

It was... desire.
Was almost one year ago.

Was a guy in accounting...

And he was working late
and I was working late...

And had no one in the building.

It was not planned.

He not even know I was there...

He came to leave a cost reporting...

So be there by morning.

2 And we were working very hard for days.

I do not know what happened.

I had never been attracted to him before.

We have not said anything to each other.

Was something,
something in the air, I do not know...

For more ridiculous it seems.

I think...

My biggest regret is knowing
how much it hurt Chris...

If he found out.

Why are you looking at me like that?

Well, almost a year.

No, I menstruei one week later.

E pregnant two weeks after that.

Do you think I'm the devil.

No, I think.

Why keeps looking at me like that?

Well, it's just that...

If I had done
a list of people who never betrayed...

You would be on top of it.

Do you think all this fear
you're feeling tonight...

Is actually about that night?

No, I... I is now considering?

I can not help.

You are assuming that since you
betrayed him, he will betray you?

No, I do not know.

I do not know if I have more fear
he betray me, betray me than not.

I think my biggest problem is...

I need to figure out if I less like who I am...

Before discovering what I really want.

Understood.

Got it?

You'll have a baby...

And what you want
not come in 1st place for long.

Sorry, is how it happens.

I know.

You know, marriage has many rules
that confuse people.

Instead,
pay more attention to the rules...

Rather than how they feel...

And what they want for
themselves and for the other.

They forget the relationship
and before they realize...

Temptation begins to circle, and they
not even know why.

Why is not in the rulebook.

Seems is a place I've ever been.

I have never been married.

I know, but you went through some
thing that inspired this statement.

Partly, but not as much as
I've seen people passing by.

I have two friends who are now divorcing.

I'm sorry.

It's a shame.

Kevin is with his wife 16 years ago...

And my other friends have
been together for 23.

And you are a friend of
the husband and wife?

You think you know someone
and 20 years later...

Discovers that they have a hand
has ever known.

Or maybe they knew.

Until one day, suddenly,
everything was different...

And now everyone is fighting.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Is not what you feel.
Well, it's sad.

Oh, yeah. I heard the wedding of two sides.
I've seen a lot.

Both are not allowed to have their chances.

I did not say that.
But you said.

No. At the time of my life...

I know what I want and what I do not want
. Like you said.

Have you been betrayed?

Yes.

More than once?

And have you ever cheated?

Yes.

I did things in my life
that are not very commendable...

And I'm not proud of it.

But I also do not deny.
It was all in the past.

It?
Yes it is.

Well, why do it?

Why have I been unfaithful?

I will not talk about it,
no longer matters.

You learn from life and simply move on.

I'm not sure that you followed.

Can be as you see.

It is your decision how much of my past
matter to you.

There is nothing I can do about it.

Are you worried about mine?

Why not?
Are behind you.

I will not worry who you were.

I'm wondering who you
is now sitting around this table.

With you, it seems that nobody
really know anyone.

Not completely, but I like it.

I have not done
the best choices in my life...

But I learned from those who did.

I'm starting to see...

That in his experience,
betray women...

And things tend to go a certain way.

So I think you should
know who you're dealing with now.

I never cheated in my life,
it never occurred to me.

I never will.

When I'm in a good relationship...

Is fully satisfactory and if I'm in a bad...

I spend my energy trying to fix
, or trying cairfora.

And frankly, I do not know
how anyone gets a case...

Maybe I'm too selfish with my time...

But I do not know if he had time for one.

What is it? Do not believe me?
I said nothing.

Not needed.

Listen, I can not be on Planet
so long as you...

But have experienced my share of silly...

And I'm not interested in a
relationship that involves it.

I'll contartudo you want to know about me...

Because lying is just another silly
and life is too short.

You are an honorable woman.

I know. Not everyone who
know me like me...

But nobody can accuse me of
not to say things as they are...

And if I quisertransar with someone else...

I'll come and say that
not want anything more to you...

And I'll go ahead with the I want to do.

Not that I imagine it happening.

God, I do not want to be with someone
do not want to be with me.

Not afraid to be alone...

And I prefer going through the
disappointment and rejection...

And move on,
than being deceived...

Because the disappointment is what
actually destroys the person.

I can never stay with you...

The break does not hurt
as much as the damage...

Caused by the faith of a person
on their own judgment.

I know.
I'm leaving...

Me too.

Oh, my God.
I will not be...

As a Cowboy Made to be free.

There is nothing that I do not.

Not my way not me.

I'll never forget.

I know you moved.

Like a cowboy walks alone What.

Baby, continue.

Like a cowboy Made to be free.

There is nothing that I do not.

Not my way not me.

Oh, no.
I'll never forget.

It's not the guy What does the
...- Commercial Company Super Star.

Know him?
Yes.

Andy.

Hi, tree.

I'll never forget.
Andy...

I know you went ahead.

Hey, man of the mattress.
Chris.

Hey, man, how are you?

You were born to wander through the land.

Andy.

My heart cries But I understand.

Andy.

Hi, Jude, what's cooking?

Do not live here any more.

You changed one month ago, remember?

Oh, yeah.

Well, it's good to see you guys.

Like a cowboy.
Andy.

Yes, Jude.

I think you should go.

I will.

Okay.

Be careful, okay?

Okay.

Like a cowboy Made to be free.

What?
He's with the clothes...

I'll masturbate, and relax...

So no one sees why I'm dressed in a robe.

I did not need to know.

Well, I bet Celia not have one of these.

She does not need one.

You know, I think that the most important...

Is know what you really want...

And be honest about it,
so nobody gets confused.

Yes.

And knowing that you
all large, and falls into the music.

Will get screwed.

You know, you are very botininha
when he says 'will get screwed.'

No, seriously, if you could have
anything in life, what would it be?

I do not know, this is a big question.

This is why have more than one answer.

Has a list?
Why not?

Well, obviously I want to be writer.

Writer you.
A paid writer.

If I could support myself...

And so wanted to write, instead
to organize it around...

My journey 14 hours of work, that
would be something beautiful.

And the world would know his work.

I think so.

Do you?

I know. I mean...

I want to be successful and I want
people like my work...

But I do not think it will be...

Will give me more satisfaction.

Financially, it will be.
And the sense of accomplishment...

What is important to me.

But I think the best part
will always be the case.

Is always very difficult to get the 1st page.

I usually not know what I'll do.

And then, I only get this
place, where there a snap...

And begins to flow from me...

Like you're in my head all the time...

And I have to put on paper once.

And it's great.
It's amazing, actually.

It's your Magic Hour.
Yeah, I think it is.

You can not feel what you do...

When you put something on the page...

But when we read his work...

We experience
a thing exists only because of its process.

And thus we are also touched.

I like it, but I'd never sold anything.

But it will.
Someday.

And what else?
What else?

You want something else, right?
It is.

E?
What is it?

I never made a list...
What was it?

It's your list, how can I know?
Well, I do not know.

Of course you know, are typical.
How?

As a wedding.

That for me may or may not be.
Children?

The same.
The same?

It is the same. What else?

We could continue without having a son?

I won without even trying.

Yeah, I could go ahead without
a child, this surprise you?

Yes, most women...

I'm not most women.

I see. Will change your mind?

Maybe, maybe not.

In the right situation, I can
imagine myself being a mother...

But only under certain circumstances.

You will have them.

Oh, they?
Now I'll have more than one?

Why not?

First, because the hormones
surely make you crazy.

And... And why...

Because I did not wake up...

A single morning in my life and thought...

I'd really like to have a baby...

And I've never been
with the son of a friend and thought...

It would be great if I had one at home?

Not once.

Maybe my Biological Clock
has not started ticking yet.

I may not have one, I do not know. Maybe...

I wake up tomorrow and think...

'Today is the Day,' and then go
the Sperm Bank.

Or call you and you scared as hell and say:

Hi, I want to have lunch with me and
maybe I then try to get pregnant?

I do not know, anything can happen.

But today, or now in this kitchen,
I'm not like 'Mom'.

And...

As any woman can think
children are the answer to life?

You know what?
You would be a great mom.

Well, I'm sure yes, but
that does not mean that I would be one.

And if it happened by accident?

I will not have an accident.
This is very old fashioned.

Happen.

Not really believe that, do you?

Happens.
Oh no, not true.

Women are 10 times more than the
manipulative of its kind...

And when we have accidents
is because we are behind something.

Love, connection, security, money...

All these above.

But I will say, there are no accidents...

Misleading
there are only women and men stupid.

I'm sorry, but I take pill since high school...

And it's not complicated.

You have children?
Not that I know.

Well, that's a fair answer.

It is the only one I have.

Do you want children?

I am good with children.

Now I got you without even trying.

Yeah, got it.
It is.

Okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

Have you ever cheated?

I will not have this conversation, Shel.

Sorry, I was just...
not know why I asked it.

Well, because if I betray...

You will use this to justify
her own infidelity...

And if I do not cheat, you will feel
the need to punish yourself even more.

You know, you never talk to
me about your relationship.

No.

Why?

Well, for starters, you're
friend of Celia and furthermore...

I do not like to talk to anyone
about our relationship.

Why? Do not think you should?
No.

Why?

Why is our relationship...

And have our own way of doing things.

Because you're so confident and secure.

You know, that's what I need Chris.

No, that's what you need you.

It's not why I'm the way I am, I mean...

Everyone is different.

You know, I'm glad helps you talk to me.

I really am.

But in the end, the only two people
in your relationship...

Are you and Chris.

No matter what I say
or what anyone else thinks.

You are the only people who really know...

What happens when the door closes
, and that's what matters.

So why know better than you two...

I only see what you want me to see.

In many ways, I am sure that
do not know actually.

I hear would be a way for you to hear...

What you're thinking, aloud...

So you can sort out what you querfazer.

Like a relationship can be
simple if you let them.

Thank you.

You know, I'll always support you and Chris
...

The decisions you make,
even though I like it or not.

Unless a crazy with a knife.

You are very good with that, I must confess
.

No, I just do not let me go.
So it is easy to have perspective.

Do you think I should tell him what I did?

With that guy?
It is.

Well, is the man who wants to pursue?
No.

Well, Chris does some idea?

I mean, there is some distrust
or some weirdness...

Hovering in the relationship?

No.

He used a condom?
Oh, my God, yes.

Actually, he had a wallet...

What I found very convenient.

Men. Then clean?
Yes.

And this baby is not it?

No.

What would be the reason to tell Chris?

Be honest.
Nonsense.

What?

You are always honest with him?

Yes, very. I mean, that lie has silly, but...

This is not how to tell him...

I bought my bag
settlement when they bought it.

No, but...

Would be relieved to tell him?
Yes.

Quertirar it off your chest?

Yes, it has haunted me a year ago.

And tell Chris make the relationship better?

Tell him you had sex with someone
a night...

Shortly before becoming pregnant baby
him, for no particular reason...

Portesão only and you were working late.

This would help the
relationship you have now...

To turn into something better?

So my punishment is having to live with it?

It.

And there is no need to punish lo.

No.

And if he finds out, I mean,
it would be much worse.

It would be humiliated.

Well, what are the chances of that?
I do not know.

Well, it's been almost a year
and for those who told you?

You...

...just for me? Alright.

You have to do what he thinks is the best
, Shel.

But if you want the relationship
said he wants to...

I think you need stop living in the past...

And olhartodas the wonderful
things you have now, and soon.

Listen,
'm not saying that what you did is correct.

But everyone makes mistakes and
best thing you can do...

Is learn from it and leave behind.

Then you lie?

Everybody lies.

So what is your recipe?

For what?
For the perfect relationship.

Oh, that.

1, I think the word 'Perfect' is a silly word...

Created by any writer ever.

And I'm sure he was drunk and
disappointed when it did.

E revenue relationship,
these are customized.

Ingredients are measured per person...

And then you have to figure
how to cook for yourself.

It's like cooking, is not it?
It is just like cooking.

The quickest way to get
the heart of a man...

Is through his stomach, and
that of a woman too.

So what is your recipe?

My?

Or is it a secret?
No.

I would say are two shares of realism...

A part honesty, part
of fun, and a part of love.

And a pinch of
be able to look the other way...

When is the best for the relationship.

No one is perfect, Shel...

But you just have to figure out who
you want in the kitchen with you.

Well, this is very to find out.

Should be.

I travel a lot, but
kids travel well, and I'm not against it.

Why are you laughing?

You have a baby.
When it happens, it happens.

If not, does not happen.
Okay.

It's not something I'm planning.

No, no, it would take more responsibility
emotional and mental...

Than an accident.

No.

Okay, I'm just happy be responsible for...

Portomar the Pill...

And believe me, I never forget.

Do not look at me like that.

We are having this conversation because
you want to know more about me...

Or because I want to
know more about you?

What are you talking?

Oh, I see.
What do you understand?

What you are well aware that
is in control of this conversation...

And will stay that way
until I call you directly.

Okay.

Okay, what?

You're worried, you have something
what you mean, what is it?

None.

Okay, what you want from life?

I have everything I need life.

'Want'. Whatever a relationship?

What I want this relationship?

In any relationship.
What do you think is important?

Take advantage of lo.

This is obvious.

Well, it would be, but I think it is
forgotten most of the time.

After a while.

I am very happy with my life...

And I am very happy to accept
it the way it comes.

How can do this with so many rules?

Rules? I do not have rules.
Oh, no?

I have no actually.

Open to all, but committed to anything.

It has to do with commitment
commitment or not.

It's about being involved...

What you think which can be anything...

Instead of
enjoy what it is and let that feeling...

Take you where you want to go.

This is a rule.
This is freedom.

Course. If you like handcuffs
with his freedom, I think it is.

No.
Yes.

Why?
Because...

In your quest to be open,
you say 'No' to many things...

Before know what are the things you want.

I know what I want.

Because of the experiences
they had in the past?

Yes.

Okay. Not limiting their own freedom...

If not explore new opportunities through?

You know, you is a very good writer.

I'm good devil's advocate.

Ah, that too. You could have been a lawyer.

I know. But, really...

What do you think is more important
in a relationship?

It depends on the relationship.

It may sound simple, but a
simple relationship...

Between two people...

May be the best and hardest thing to do.

Relationships are not simple.

No. But enjoying life with your partner...

Can be if you let it.

It's making me all these questions
because you want an answer...

Or he has something to say?

Okay.
What is more important to you?

Honesty.

Mutual respect.

And similar taste in music.

Music?
Yes, it is very important.

Okay.

Been with someone who has a
completely different musical tastes?

I think not, actually.
See?

I see nothing, except you.

For you, this has been a problem.

Absolutely.

And the relationship was not well?
No. Not good.

A week and a half together, he put a
Techno CD in the car.

Io I should have dropped right there.
Nobody listens to techno.

Do not have a soul.

For you, no soul in Techno.

To others, it defines soul.

I know, has a multitude
you could argue that...

And they could all go out
with each other. Not me.

Do you like Techno?

No, but if I liked,
not we having fun yet?

No. Not for long.

Okay, complementary differences
enhance a relationship.

Differences conflicting...

Lead to commitments reluctant.

It's just a matter of time
before the ship sink.

E... difference is
musical 'Reluctant Compromise.'

Sure, I know.

Do not look like much, that's why I got
'Mr Techno'.

But if you think about all the times that
listening to music during the day...

And then you think
half that time or even more...

Is the music that you dislike.

How about someone who
does not hear music?

Oh, no. No.

Sorry, there are some obstacles in the lane
lovers.

Alameda lovers?

Been in love?
Yes, of course, and you?

Yes, many times.

But for you, now I think
which is a very broad question.

What do you mean by love?

Well, love...

Love, how?

Love in its essence,
love with everything you do.

That's it, that's the whole definition?
Yes.

I loved...

But not always matter how much you love.

What does this mean?

Mean it does not always work.

Have you been heartbroken?
Oh, long ago, and you?

Not exactly.

I mean, I have loved enough...

But I do not think I committed enough...

To experience a heart
broken, I do not think so.

Why not?

No conscious reason,
I just always went out with guys...

With whom knew not want to stay forever...

Then when we finished up, it was good...

And I was not so sad,
except myself.

Portomar a bad decision?

What seemed to be the right
decision at the moment?

It.

So may not have been a bad decision.

I do not know.

You know, sometimes bad
decisions are taken...

...for good reason.

Sometimes, but I did
more than a few times.

But okay, now it's over.

And found love again?
Of course, and you?

Yes I have.

Sairfora could love?

Sure, anyone can sairfora love.

Do you think you have some time
limit for this?

I think the duration is different
for different people...

But I do not think that love
is the most important part...

A relationship.

I love him, you know?
I know.

I can not imagine life without him
. It would be so much fun.

Well, it looks like you made
the right choices then.

Yeah, except for one.

What?

Have you noticed that the best
conversations happen in the kitchen?

Ah, the satisfaction is the place
and distraction.

Heart problem,
heart of the house.

I love these guys.

Cannoli.
Cannoli.

Fat and sugar.
Thank God.

Know what would be best?
What?

A lover in bed.

So, will give him.

Okay.

In more ways than one.

Passion?

It's amazing, but this
comes and goes, is not it?

I do not believe
would be willing to live your life...

With someone was not in love.

I will not say that love is not a factor.

We love people with whom we spend time...

One way or another.

Otherwise, you will not
spend time with them.

But being in love, being in that
Rollercoaster...

What people want so much...

This is a different kind of love,
and that kind of amortermina.

Sometimes, perhaps.

No, I think always,
all the time.

No, you can have two.

There is nothing wrong with that, but...

Ride a Rollercoaster not last 50 years.

There are other things to do... Many other.

What things?

Type companionship, good conversation...

Laugh, caring, understanding...

Consistency, confidence.

This does not seem so bad.

I think it looks good, in fact.

I'll have to agree with you.

What about tomorrow?

Tomorrow?

Vai feel the same thing
about all this tomorrow?

Maybe, maybe not. And you?

I do not know. But...

I have a request.

What is it?
Do not break my heart.

I never want to break your heart.

Good, because you can.

St. 2:30 am.
Oh, no. Bed.

Bed.

'Between Wine & Lovers'...

Is a good name for a story.

It?
Should write it.

Okay. And it would be about?

Oh, I do not know.
You will create something.

The Moon in the sky fills
His eyes like a big pizza.

It is love...

...love is.

Like this music?
Taste.

Well, we have a chance then.

Bells will ring Ting-a-ling-a-ling,
ting-a-ling-a-ling.

And you will sing...

...bella Vita - Vita bella.

The Moon in the sky Fill your eyes.

Like a big pizza And love...
