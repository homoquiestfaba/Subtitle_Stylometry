Laura: Good morning.

Listen, my kid is selling
chocolate bars for her school.

You know, gym needs
new hoops, whoo!

Rick: How much?

10 bucks.
10 bucks?

Yeah, it's a donation.

[ laughing ] rick!

That's not a donation,
that's extortion.

Can I help you?

Look alive, everybody.
Mr. Rick.

I see you fell for the
chocolate-bar-extortion racket

In the lobby this morning.

Everybody did, I guess.
Hey, rick!

What a weekend for great games,
eh, buddy?

Hey, rick-o. Did you get
yourself a chocolate bar?

Look good, rick.
You been working out?

<i>Buenos dÃ­as,</i> my man.
Hey, "kemo sabe"
to you, too.

And congratulations,
you paid 10 bucks

For 25 cents
worth of chocolate.

You genius!

[ chuckles ]

I have a 9:00 interview
with rick...

O'lette.
That was just him.

Oh, uh,
the guy who --

Yep.
You're michelle?

Yes.

Please sign in.

I'll call him and let him
know you're here.

Rick? Laura.

[ giggles ]

Yeah, yeah.

Listen, uh,
michelle's here.

[ laughing ] no.

Michelle, your 9:00.

[ giggles ]

Your 9:00 interview,
she's here.

[ laughs ]

See for yourself, rick.

Yeah.

[ laughs ]

See for yourself.

Okay.

[ laughing ] no.

[ hangs up phone ]

He's just finishing
something up,

So you can wait outside his door
until he's done.

Great.

Down the hall,
right at the water cooler,

Left at the fax,
left at the coffee,

Up the stairs,
third door.

What?

Down the hall,
right at the water cooler,

Left at the fax,
left at the coffee,

Up the stairs,
third door.

Down the hall, r--
rick's office?

Down the hall,
right at the water cooler,

Left at the fax,
left at the coffee,

Up the stairs,
third door.

Thank you.

Man: Yes, sir, 31% gain.

I've spoken to the lawyer,

And he should contact you
by this afternoon.

[ beeping ]

[ knock on door ]

Rick: Monica?

Michelle.

Michelle. I'm sorry.

Open the door.

Mr. O'lette.

Rick, call me rick.
Everybody just calls me rick.

Okay, rick.

Michelle, did laura tell you,
or did she not,

That I was
finishing something up

And that you could wait
outside my office?

Um...

Because if she didn't,

I can call
and fire her right now.

Oh, no, I'm --

But if she did,
why don't you shut the door

And wait outside
like you were told to?

Mr. O'lette, I'm sor--
rick!

I'm sorry, I didn't --

Michelle, which is it,
fire laura or shut the door?

Um...
Which is it, michelle,
fire laura or shut the door?

Uh...

[ door closes ]

[ mouse clicking ]

Ha!

[ grunts ]

[ sighs ]

[ keyboard clicking ]

Suck on that,
"bigboss."

[ chuckles ]

[ beeps ]

[ duke humming ]

â™ª I said,
"put it in your mouth â™ª

â™ª in your motherfucking mouth" â™ª

[ keyboard clicking ]

[ electronic music plays ]

â™ª she said
put it in her mouth, mouth â™ª
â™ª put it in my mouth â™ª

â™ª I mean her motherfucking
mouth, her mouth â™ª

â™ª she said put it in her mouth â™ª

Oh, no way!

Read it and weep,
my friend.
No fucking way!

[ laughs ]

Set up the martinis, buddy.
I can't believe it.

Shaken,
not stirred, please.

Fuck you!
Fuck you with a 10-foot dildo.

Fair's fair, bigboss!

I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna fire you!

A bet's a bet,
fair's motherfucking fair.

I'm gonna kill you
and then I'm gonna fire you.

Oh, that's what you get
for betting on losers!

Losers?

[ laughing ] yeah.

Let me tell you something.

I'm gonna tie you up,
I'm gonna rip out your eyes,

I'm gonna stick a red-hot poker
up your ass!

And then
I'm gonna kill you!

Then I'm gonna fire you,

Then I'm gonna buy myself
drinks, you motherfucker!

[ laughs ]

Huh? Here!

No!

I am gonna get tony
from maintenance up here.

He's gonna fuck you
up the ass.

And then I'm gonna
kill you again!

And then I'm gonna fire you!

No, don't fire me!

That's right, yeah,
under that desk!

Let me out of here!

Hey, I'm gonna get tony
from maintenance up here

And take this bust
and fuck you up the ass!

And then I'm gonna kill you.

And then I'm gonna fire
your whole fucking family!

[ both laugh ]

Have mercy, mercy!

All right.

Let's go get a drink,
you asshole.

[ laughs ]

You crack me up!

[ both laugh lightly ]

Did you find
an assistant today?

Ah, I only had
one interview.

What was wrong with her?

[ sighs ] attitude.
Attitude, attitude, attitude.

She made me feel
like a waiter.

Ha!

"how about a comfy,
little chair?

"how about a
beautiful girlfriend

"for your dinky,
little rÃ©sumÃ©.

How about a whop
to the face?"

Jesus christ,
I couldn't believe her.

Hey, hey...

Was she blond?

What?

Uh, I'm looking for an intern
right now, you know?

No, no,
she wasn't a blonde.

They keep sending me
these little boy yalies.

I'm looking for a blonde,
you know?

No, she was chinese.

In fact,
that's how it started.

Michelle.

Michelle: Yes?

Now I'm done.

Okay.

Come on in.

Thanks.

Sit down.

Thanks.

I have my rÃ©sumÃ©.

I have your rÃ©sumÃ©.

So you're from china?

My grandparents
are from japan.

"my grandparents
are from japan."

Gee whiz, I'm sorry,

I didn't realize I had to have
a ph-fucking-d in geography

Before I could possibly
interview you.

Ha!

I'm sorry, japan.

I'm not an expert
at last names, michelle.

That's okay.

I'll tell you what I am
an expert at, though.

Can you guess?

Um...

Go on...Guess.

Consulting.

People.

You know, that's true, rick,
you are.

I really like
to think so.

I mean, you were so good
during the layoffs,

Helping me help
certain people understand

They weren't
necessary here.

Fired their asses.
Fired their asses.

How many people
could do that?

I can do that.

Hey, rick, everybody bought
a chocolate bar but you.

I mean, do you know people,
or do you know people?

That really isn't
much of a choice, duke.

People.
People.

Because that's what
it's all about, isn't it?

Here at image,
we like to say,

"we can do this."

And how do we do this?

Well, we derive
our business from customers.

But it's difficult
to remember that customers

Are actually...People.

I mean,
even the word "customer,"

It sounds so impersonal.

Customer.

Customer.

[ high-pitched voice ]
customer.

[ high-pitched voice ]
customer.
Customer.

Customer.              Customer.

[ normal voice ]
oh, yeah, you're right, rick.

I never thought about it
like that.

Huh?

Customer.

[ normal voice ]
say it with me.

Customer.

Customer.

Ta ha!

See?

It's difficult to remember that
they're actually people.

And when you
look outside...

...All those customers
look like specks.

But you know what?

They're not specks,
monica.

Michelle.
They're people.

And that's why
I'm a people expert.

I've got to be.
I can do this.

Image wants customers,
customers are people,

And that's why
I'm a people expert.

Michelle, my name is --

And that's why I know

That you aren't the person
for this job...

Michelle.

What?
Because
I'm a people expert.

And you aren't
the people...Person.

What?
I know,
I haven't interviewed you.

I don't have to, michelle.

This rÃ©sumÃ© means nothing,

Because
what's important --
[ scoffs ]

Michelle,
what's really important --

Magna cum laude?
No.

Some dinky,
summer internship? No.

"currently employed
in food service"?

No.

That's nothing.

Any one of those specks
out there, they got all that.

What?

"what? What?
What?"

She sounded like some kind of

Oriental sphinx or something,
you know?

Just saying,
"wha--, wha--, what?"

She couldn't
get the words out.

She acted like squirrels
were running around,

Screeching in her brain,
"what? What?"

Looking good, guy.
Right back at you.

No other responses.
Just like, "what, what?"

W-w-what?

That's nothing.
That doesn't tell me anything.

You know what
tells me something?

When someone is asked
to wait outside

And then knocks
on the door.
What?

Somebody who sits down
for an interview,

And then starts
correcting me

Because I didn't get
each tiny detail

Of her entire family history
exactly right.
What?

Somebody who projects
major attitude to me,

But when given a chance
to defend herself

Can only reply
with one word

Over, over, over,
and over again!

What?!

Just "what, what?!
What?!"

She didn't know
what hit her.

"what?! What?!"

Duke: Ha, ha, ha!

Laura: So how'd it go?

[ elevator dings ]

[ both laugh ]

"what, what?"

So you threw her
right out?
Yeah.

That's priceless.

For you, bigboss,
it's free.

You kill me.

No, you crack me up.

No, no, no, no, no.

You kill me.

I think about it.

Ha!                          Ha!

That's a very big camera.

What is this place?

[ dance music playing ]

Mick: Duke!

Mike!

Mick.
Mick.

Rick!
Rick? Mick.
Duke?

Drinks?
Come on.

Okay, you guys
take your seats,

Relax, enjoy the view,

And I'll send a waitress
over with your drinks.

We might need
two waitresses.

He owes me
a lot of booze.

Ha!

Ho-ho...

This guy
is funny, duke.

This guy is funny.

[ laughs ]

Wow.

Mm-hmm.

Mmm.

Oh, yeah.

New place?

Yeah.

Ahh.

Mmm.

So did you actually
watch that game,

Or did you learn online
that you pick losers?

Hoo! Tony!

What do you call
a point spread like that?

I call it --

I call it
a round of drinks.

Yeah.

Where the fuck
is our waitress, anyway?

Oh, hey, sorry...

To keep
you guys waiting.

Oh.

[ laughs ]

Uh...

Duke, this is the...

Uh, interview
that I told you about today.

Ha!
How's it going, michelle?

Look, mr. O'lette,
I'm sorry the interview --

Hey, hey, hey, hey, no.

I'll bet
you're "sorry the interview."

Why don't you go
up to the bar,

Get us some party mix,

And then come back and tell us
how sorry you are.

Unless that's
too demeaning

For a magna cum laude
like yourself.

What?
What? What?

You see, that's the one word
in her vocabulary,

But maybe it means something
different in chinese.

I'm not chinese.
I know.

Your grandparents
are from japan.

Fuck you.

What, me?
Yeah, fuck me?

Excuse me,
what the hell is going on?

We're in a "fuck me/fuck you"
debate here, mick.

Oh, margaret, what the hell's
going on here?

It's miche--

I'm sorry, mr. Berkman,
I can't --

Hey, call me mick.

I can't serve
this table, mick.

You can't serve
this table?

No, I'm sorry.

Okay, well, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

You don't have to serve
this table.
I don't?

No, 'cause you're fired.

[ laughs ]

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

What?
You're fired!

Don't you speak english?
Huh?

Hey, I'm sorry about this,
gentlemen.

Tonight, all the drinks
are on the house.

Thank you, mike.

[ sighs ]

Uh, get out of here.

Thanks a lot,
thanks a fucking lot.

Nice to see you again,
michelle.

[ laughs ]

Okay,
you can do this, rick.

You can humiliate me...

And mock me...

And insult me
and get me fired.

Look,
I didn't know that --
but you know what?

You're still
an evil person, rick.

You hurt an innocent person
and you will pay for it.

I curse you, rick.

You're an evil person
with an evil soul

And it will
come back to you.

It will come
right back at you.

I curse you, rick o'lette!
It will come right back at you.

Whoa.

Looks like, uh...

Triumphant pms
at remote lounge tonight, huh?

Yep.

Ha.

Well, listen, rick,
I, uh...

I got to get back
to the office,

Finish up a few things.
[ sighs ]

Working late, huh?

Well, it's only
7:00 something, guy.

I've just got a couple of things
I've got to finish off.

That's why you got
the corner office, pal.

Ha!
That's right.

Oh, and, uh...

Don't let
what's-her-name upset you, huh?

It's her grandparents
that should upset you.

They're from japan,
did you know that?

[ laughs ]
that's very funny.

[ imitates michelle ]
cu-u-u-rsed!

[ snaps fingers ]

Oh!
I wanted to remind you --

I know,
always wear a condom.

[ laughs ] no.

I wanted to make sure
that you got the e-mail

About the office
christmas party.

Yeah,
I e-mailed you back,

I've just got to go to
the storage space, get my stuff.

You mind if I ask you
what that's --

Oh, just don't worry
about it, okay?

Hey, you're lucky
you own the stuff.

I got to go out and buy.

Mountain-climbing equipment
at a christmas party.

I mean,
does not compute, you know?

Rick, that's why I got
the corner office, okay?

Adios, amigo.

I think you can trust me.

After all, I'm old enough
to be your father,

For christ's sakes.

Sorry.

Trust me.

Hello?

[ shrieks ]

Oh.

Want another martini?

â™ª say, hey, babe â™ª

Are you a fag?

No, rick,
I'm not a fag.

Shit. Bill?

Buck.
Shit!

Buck! Ha!
Sorry, I --

Do you want
another martini, rick?

Yeah. Mick?

Rick.
Buck.

Mick.
Buck.

Mick, another round.

You got it.

So, buck...

It's been a long time.

Yes, it has, rick.
Yes, it has.

What have you been up to
since you left image?

I never worked
at image, rick.

We got our mbas together.

You're buck.

Third time's
the charm, rick.
Mick, this is buck.

Yes, we've met.

Yeah, but this time
he knows who the hell I am.

Mick,
this round's on me.

This round's
on the house, remember?

Oh, yeah.

They really
like you here.

[ sighs ]

Yeah, actually, uh...

There was this
chinese cur--

Forget about it.

So what have you
been doing

Since you left school?

I got my own company.

Hmm.

[ whistling ]

â™ª in your
motherfucking mouth â™ª

Looking good, guy.
[ snaps fingers ]

Right back at you.

[ whistling ]

Rick: What is it exactly
that you do?

Oh, we're a consulting firm,
pretty much.

Our motto is...

"we take the rat race
to the next level."

Oh, yeah, image did
the next level last week.

â™ª she said
put it in her mouth, mouth â™ª
â™ª put it in my mouth â™ª

â™ª I mean her motherfucking
mouth, her mouth â™ª

â™ª she said put it in her mouth â™ª

Duke:
All right, little girl...

Daddy's home.

Boom.

[ beeps ]

That's not
what I'm talking about, rick.

I'm talking about
the next level.

Oh, there's
a new next level?

Great.
Calls for another drink.

Eh?

You have no idea what the hell
I'm talking about, do you?

Not in this life.

You remember jack?

Mmm, jack?
Second-year marketing?

Oh, jack, sure.

Yeah, all right,
you don't remember jack.

He was in school
with us, too.

Jack's over at facade,
associate vice president.

He'd progressed as far as he was
really gonna get, you know?

He had a big boss
who wasn't going anywhere,

If you know what I mean.

Big boss
liked having jack around,

But there was nothing like
a promotion coming out of that,

You know?

I mean, if you were
in a position like that,

How would you get ahead?

I'd prove my excellence.

Oh, he did that already.

Turn my position
into platinum.

Rick, he read
all those books, too.

And I'm telling you,
he did that.

I don't know, quit his job,
become a rodeo clown --

What am I, a swami?

Ha, ha, ha.

Sometimes it feels like
we're on a chess board --

Pawns on a chess board.

But a pawn
can only move forward

If there's no other piece
in his way.

My job...

Is to remove
that other piece.

Ohh. [ sighs ]

Look, next time just say,
"I'm a headhunter,"

Instead of hosting
your own game show, all right?

It'll get you
laid faster.

Like you'd know
about that.

[ laughs ]

Can I have
the check, please?

These drinks
are on the house, remember?

That's right.

Well, I guess I can just leave,
can't I?

Look, I think I can help you.
I think my company can help you.

What makes you think
I need help?

Look at you, rick.

Fuck you.

Okay, you got cable tv?

Yes, I have cable tv.

Watch "business talk"
tomorrow morning.

It comes on at --
I know when it's on.

I think you'll have
a better picture

Of what I'm talking about.

Hmm, well, always nice to spend
time with a psychopath.

Catch you later, buck.

Watch the show...Okay?

Taxi.

Hey!

What the fuck?

[ car horn beeps ]

All right, taxi!

Hey, hey!
Hey!

Whoo-hoo!

Whoo, "I give you chinese curse,
rick o'lette.

You never catch taxi."
taxi.

Ta-- hey!
You don't like money?

Duke:
Ooh, you are a nasty girl.

[ chuckles ]

Okay, let's see
what you got.

[ beeps ]

Eve:
[ chuckles ] all right.

"I'm dripping...

"right through...

My leopard-skin..."
eve!

[ giggles ] "panties."

Take that, bigboss.

[ beeps ]

[ devilish laugh ]

I bet.

Well, I'm gonna...

â™ª put it in your mouth â™ª

Is it my imagination,

Or is bigboss even nastier
than usual this evening?

I think he had to scrub out
the slurpee machine today.

[ giggles ]

Oh, my god!

[ laughs ]

"okay...

[ typing ]

I will."

"now...

"it's much easier...

To touch --"

Stroke...Stroke.

Ooh, that's good.

You must have been
practicing.

Shut up.

[ beeps ]

Mmm.

You nasty, little bitch.

[ laughs ]

Like a guy who calls himself
bigboss even has a 10-inch arm.

Maybe he has 10-inch
love handles.

Love handles,
on a postal clerk?

You think?

Mmm, probably not.

Postal workers probably
steal all the porno they need.

Aren't you afraid

Bigboss might look up your real
name and come visit?

Nah,
dad's got pass secret.

What's that?

One of those top-secret,
no-peeking,

Super-government,
crypto-password programs

They sell
at the sharper edge.

Maybe he's been
naughtychatting, too.

No way!

I'll bet he has a monthly
surcharge on his platinum card.

Well, you mean...

He doesn't...

You mean what?

Sorry, nothing.

I know what you mean.

He doesn't have mom.

That's not what I meant.

[ cellphone rings ]

Hello?

Hey, how are you doing?

Mm, hey, dad.
We were just talking about you.

Vicki, you know vicki.

Oh, yeah.
What are you two up to?

We're, um, having sex.

Oh, that's good.
Just don't join the army.

Dad says hi.

â™ª your motherfucking mouth â™ª

Oh...

Yeah.

Okay.

You want to play rough?

Look, I've got to go
to the storage space,

Get some stuff.

It's some things
I need for --

Duke wants me
to get some things.

Well...

[ giggles ]

Uh-huh, don't worry about it,
we'll order something.

[ giggling ]

[ exhales ]

I ain't done yet.

If that's the way you want it...

No, no, I was thinking that
maybe you wanted to go with me.

To the storage space?

Well, I thought maybe we could
have dinner first.

Verdi's?
Make an evening out of it.

[ laughs ]

What for?

Keep it coming, baby.

[ humming ]

Daddy's got to type
with one hand now.

What do you mean,
"what for?"

To celebrate my joining
the black panthers.

â™ª your motherfucking mouth â™ª

[ both giggle ]

Dad,
it's a school night.

Look, I'm sure you're not gonna
wreck that c-minus average

That you've been working
so hard at.

â™ª your motherfucking mouth â™ª

Come on,
put on a nice dress

And let me spend
100 bucks on you.

Um...Why?

Yeah.

Because I had
a lousy day, okay?

I had drinks with a midget,
I had a chinese curse put on me,

And my college buddy's
turned into a psychopath.

[ moans ]

[ laughter ]

Just let me
take you out to dinner.

Yeah, okay, I'll go.

Yes.

[ giggling ] yes.

Yeah, I'll change.

I mean, I'm already naked,
so...Yeah.

From now on --
oh, my god --

If you're even
a little preoccupied

When you're on the phone
with me...

Cosmo?

No, I'm good.

Suit yourself.

I think homeroom's better
with a hangover.

[ belt buckle jingles ]

[ whistles, sighs ]

Yeah, that's right.

[ sniffs ]

Whew.

We can do this.

[ breathing heavily ]

Whew.

â™ª I said... â™ª

â™ª put it in your mouth â™ª

[ smooches ]

Back to business.

Are you sure
you don't want one?

I said I'm good.

Did you hand in
that stupid form today?

Oh, shit.

Shit, shit!

Today was the last day.

I thought we were gonna do
this internship together,

That was
the whole thing.

I'm doomed.

Yeah, you are doomed.

If you don't do
a christmas internship,

Then egmont
makes you pick up trash.

They're not gonna make me
pick up trash.

You know, I'm gonna
talk to my dad.

Maybe there's some thing
at his stupid company.

There has
to be something.

Everything good
is gone, eve.

I know.

[ sighs ]

I'm doomed.

I'm doomed.

Looking good, man.

Right back at you.

[ elevator dings ]

Hi, vicki.

Hey, mr. O'lette.

I thought you were
gonna call me rick.

Hey, rick.

Hey.

Hey, are you ready?

'cause I'm starving.

Oh, jesus.

What?

What?

Go to your room
and put something on

With nice, little,
pink bows all over it.

Dad!

Don't you have, like,
a sailor suit or something?

Don't you like it?

Yes, yes,
I like it, yes,

But it's just
me with you --

See, it's not like
you're my daughter,

It's like you're some
supermodel that I'm dating.

Dream on, dad.
Come on, let's go.

Wait...Wait.

It's cold outside.

It's very cold outside.

All right, give me a pen.

Let's see what you got.

Fine, I'm sick
of you whining, anyway.

Okay, first thing...

A crazy man on the subway
this morning.

That counts.

A crazy man on the subway?

No, no, no, no.

There's always
a crazy man on the subway.

Yeah, but he smelled
like barf.

Aw, you know
what this is?

It's the smallest violin
in the world and --

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and it's playing just for me.

Well, look at you,
you're getting tipsy.

[ scoffs ] so?

Well, so...
You're a lightweight.

Now you know.

It's good to learn
these things early on.

Whatever.

Okay...

Pop quiz in geometry.
How's that?

Isosceles triangles
is the first thing

I had to look at today.

Uh, that's good.

And then I have to find...

Uh, some sort of
christmas internship.

What does that mean,
you work for santa?

No.

During vacation,
I have to get a job.

I have to work in, you know,
a career of my choosing.

Oh,
that's gonna be rough.

I don't think they
have...Movie-star interns.

I don't want to be
a movie star.

I just have
to do something

That, you know,
interests me.

What interests you?

Oh.

See what I mean?

I'm doomed.

Uh...
[ sighs ]

No, no,
I just mean, um...

I miss mom.

What?

I miss...

You just --

...Mom.

You've had too much wine,
that's all.

What?

You mean that if I didn't
drink so much wine

I-I wouldn't --

No, no,
that's not what I meant.

How's everything here?

Hey!

I can't believe
what you said to our server.

Our server?
He's a waiter.

He had this
I'm-a-nice-person routine.

There was no reason --

Oh, no, no, he's a waiter
and who are you

And what's with these cabs,
anyway?

They just don't like you.
Let me handle it.

No, no, no, I can do this.
Hey, hey!

[ imitating rick ]
I can do this.

[ scoffs ] jesus.

No, I'm not gonna let you
call one.

You stand out here
and the cabby's gonna stop,

Beat me up, and hijack you
to yemen or something.

And zip up your parka.

It's too hot.

No, it's the wine --
hey, hey!

It's the wine, now --

It's just this goddamn
chinese curse is what it is.

Her grandparents
were from japan.

Oh, you're the protector

Of all the entitled victims
of the world.

All right.

All right.

Call me a cab.

That's very impressive.

Now I'm gonna have to find
monica's number,

Call her, and make her
president of image.

Michelle.
Ah, okay.

[ shrieks ]

Rick.

What are you,
stalking me?

Well!

Dinner at verdi's?

Uh, no, thanks,
we just had one.

[ laughs ]
uh, I'm duke.

I'm rick's boss.

This is eve.
Eve, I've told you about her.

Eve, it's nice
to finally meet you.

And you're, uh...
This is...

This is my long-suffering wife,
you remember her.

Nora.

Rick o'lette,
and this is rick's...

That's eve and this is our cab.
We're gonna be taking your cab.

Have fun with it, then.

[ laughter ]

Hey, eve, eve...

It was a real pleasure
meeting you, a real pleasure.

And you, do not forget
the mountain-climbing equipment.

No, not to worry,
bigboss.

[ chuckles ]

All right.

Hey, you two behave.

[ laughs ]

[ sighs ]

Hey.

Wind it up.

I never knew your boss
was so young.

I told
you he was young.

Not that young...

And cute.

[ chuckles ]

Are all the guys like that
at image?

No.

So I thought we were going
to the storage space.

No, we're gonna do that tomorrow
or the next day.

I want to get you home.

I don't want you hung over
for your next pop quiz.

And he's not cute.

How's geometry going,
anyway?

How come you call him
bigboss?

Because he's the big...

You know, boss.

Why?

[ laughs ]

Because...

I think you need to learn
how to stop screaming

When you see him.

Hmm.

Hey, how's my main man?

I'm all right.
What's up with you?

Oh, dad got me
drunk again.

You think he's gonna
take advantage of me

In my inebriated state?

Eve, here we go.

Good night.

Right back at you.

Hey.

What?

What you were
saying before...

I miss her, too.

Yeah.

I think about her
all the time.

Every day it's like,

"what would mom think?"

I think
she'd be proud of you.

Stop.

She'd say --

She'd say...

"don't talk        "don't talk
so loud."          so loud."

[ laughs ]
she always used to say that.

It's not even that,
I'm just --

I mean,
I'm always missing her.

"I miss mom."

It's like my motto.

Sometimes I write it down
on a piece of paper,

For no reason.

It's my atm thing,
you know.

It spells it out.

I-m-I-s-s...

4-6-4-7-7-6-6-6.

I miss mom.

I know it's corny.

I don't think it's corny.

Yeah, yeah, it is.

I'm glad
we had this talk.

What talk?

[ elevator dings ]

[ door opens ]

Hang up your parka.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And get some sleep.

I don't have time to sleep.
I'm doomed.

Oh, no, I shouldn't have let you
have so much wine.

You didn't let me,
I just took it.

Well, just go to bed.

Don't stay up all night
at the computer.

[ smooches ]

Just don't worry
about me, okay?

Announcer on tv:<i> From new york,</i>

<i>The financial capital</i>
<i>of the world,</i>

<i>This is "business talk."</i>

Man:<i> Good morning,</i>
<i>and welcome to "business talk."</i>

<i>We'll have the usual, complete</i>
<i>stock reports every 15 minutes,</i>

<i>As well as today's</i>
<i>in-depth interview</i>

<i>With millionaire,</i>
<i>motivator,</i>

<i>And singer-songwriter,</i>
<i>tommy success.</i>

<i>But first,</i>
<i>a late-breaking story.</i>

<i>Earl dekeese, president</i>
<i>of the facade corporation,</i>

<i>Died last night in what</i>
<i>authorities have stated</i>

<i>Is either a suicide</i>
<i>or a bizarre coincidence.</i>

Dad?
<i>The body of this</i>
<i>54-year-old executive</i>

<i>And horse-racing enthusiast</i>
<i>was found</i>

<i>Covered in bruises and</i>
<i>floating in the east river...</i>

Dad?
Yeah.

<i>...After he apparently</i>
<i>announced suicidal intentions.</i>

I wanted to ask you about
that christmas intern thing?

<i>The circumstances surrounding</i>
<i>mr. Dekeese's death</i>

<i>Have been classified</i>
<i>somewhat differently</i>

<i>By the executive's wife, mona,</i>
<i>who suspects foul play.</i>

I was just thinking
maybe I can work at image.

[ no audio ]

<i>I'm sorry, there must</i>
<i>have been a glitch.</i>

Dad?

<i>Um, mr. Dekeese has been</i>
<i>replaced by jack lantern...</i>

Image?
<i>...An associate vice president</i>

<i>Voted in by an emergency</i>
<i>meeting of the board.</i>

Uh, no, no, no, no.
That's out of the question.

<i>Mr. Lantern gave us an</i>
<i>exclusive, "business talk" talk</i>

<i>About mr. Dekeese's confession</i>

<i>Of an apparent wish for death</i>
<i>just last night.</i>

<i>We were just having</i>
<i>some cocktails...</i>

Holy...
<i>...Going over some details</i>
<i>on a contract.</i>

I know that guy, that's...

<i>...Drown himself</i>
<i>in the east river.</i>

<i>I thought he was just joking.</i>

<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>he wasn't joking.</i>

Man:<i> Facade's corporate status</i>
<i>is no joke, either.</i>

<i>Last year,</i>
<i>the wall street journal</i>

<i>Reported the company's earnings</i>
<i>at $140 zillion.</i>

<i>I'm sorry...</i>

<i>That can't be right.</i>

Jesus,
so I got to pay you $10

Every single time I want
to taste something sweet?

[ elevator dings ]
rick.

How are you?
[ laughs ]

Good morning.

Hey, hey, how'd it go last night
with that little cutie, huh?

What?

â™ª daylight come,
tell the bitch go home â™ª

What are you talking about?

Don't you play innocent with me,
you dirty, old man.

I see the dogs were out
last night. [ barks ]

No, stay away
from that battle.

Come on, you're in the land
of the sickos now, amigo.

What was her name again?

Eve.

Eve, yeah, eve what?
Eve o'lette!

For christ's sake,
you asshole.

Asshole?

Forget it.

[ scoffs ]

Hey, I'm sorry.

It's not my fault she's so...
[ grunts ]

Rick.

Hey, don't forget that
mountain-climbing equipment.

What?

It's not my fault he's got
a hot-looking wife.

I thought
his wife was dead.

[ chuckles ]

She was not dead.

Man:
Hey, everybody, rick's here.

Man #2:
[ echoing ] rick-o!

[ echoing conversations ]

[ telephone ringing ]

[ shrieks ]

[ drops briefcase ]

You have got to stop
with that screaming thing.

What are you doing here?

I was wondering if you watched
any tv this morning.

Yes, now get out of here.

So you understand
what it is that we do.

People, there's a complete
nut case in here.

I understand an old college
buddy is gone completely psycho.

Get the hell out of here!

[ laughing ]
who is it?

This guy I went to school with.
Get him out of here.

Jane.

Buck.
It's a pleasure.

What is it
that you do, buck?
I kill people.

Oh, did you do
that big layoff at pretense?

No, facade.

Oh, you really do
kill people.

Yes, indeed.

Good to see you.
Later, rick.

This curse
has really got me.

What's her last name?

Freeman, she works over at --
stop that!

Sorry, rick,
duke just asked me --
not now, jane, no.

No!

Sit down, rick.

No!

I think we can help
one another.

You are a psychopath.

A psychopath kills a random
person for no good reason.

I kill someone of my client's
choosing for $10,000.

Don't give me that --
only $10,000, huh?

Plus expenses.
Remember, I'm tax-free.

How many of these
do you do?

More than you'd think.

I can't believe
that I'm sitting here talking --

Rick, get over this
little morality soft-shoe.

Look, this is buck
you're talking to, okay?

I remember
the boom-boom room.

[ knock on door ]

With new clients,
I usually have to

Talk them through this big,
justification dance,

The survival
of the fittest,

The sanctity of life
in post cold-war america.

A plane could hit this building
at any moment,

Man's inherent
drive for violence,

The culture
of late capitalism.

"hindus believe
in reincarnation,"

Yada, yada, yada,
but come on, rick.

I know
you've thought about it,

I just want you
to think about it a little more.

[ knock on door ]

Jane.

Rick, duke thinks
it's important.

Not now.
Are you bringing eve
to the christmas party?

What?

Are you bringing eve
to the christmas party?

[ laughing ]
no, I'm not bringing --

No, I'm not bringing eve
to the christmas party,

Whoever's out there!

Get out of here!

Duke: â™ª put it in your mouth â™ª

â™ª in your motherfucking mouth â™ª

â™ª I said put it in your mouth â™ª

[ whistling ]

Rick: Okay...

When someone says
they have a contract out

On someone else's life,

Is there actually a contract
or is that --

That's just
a figure of speech.

I-I...

[ whistling continues ]

You want
to take a walk?

Yeah.

Yes. Yes.

Rick: Laura?
Yes?

Hi, laura,
uh, uh, laura...

I'm just stepping out
for a second.

No problem.
Yes.

I'm just
talking over some things.

Right.

I'll be seeing, uh, this
gentleman here, this is, uh...

Yes.

...Dave, he's from, uh...

No problem.

...Uh, I'll be
just a second.

[ elevator dings ]

Yes.

I'll be right back.
We're, uh, just talking over...

Absolutely.
...Some things,
that's all.

Yes.

No problem.

Bye.

I got it.

I got it!

A $3,000 retainer.

$3,000?

Just while
you think it over.

That seems
a little steep.

What did you pay your broker
for that apartment of yours?

How do you know
about my apartment?

Rick, I just don't go
door-to-door for these things.

[ beeps ]

Duke: Yeah...Come to papa.

You're late for a date
with the duke.

Yes?
I'm very busy right now.

I'll make it quick.

[ inhales deeply ]
I quit!

I quit, I quit,
I quit, I quit!

[ door slams ]

[ laughing ]
I quit, I quit!

Jack is the kind of guy that
he knew where he was going.

All right, all right.

You're pretty,
pretty swift,

But --
but how many bodies

Can they find floating down
the east river

With cooked-up
suicide stories

Before they wise up
and you're out of business?

That was the first time
we did a suicide thing.

Usually we just
hide the project.

Hide the project?

"stash the body" I think
is what you're talking about.

[ beeping ]

Well, it's not working.
I guess that's a sign.

I can think about it for
a couple of days and then...

[ beeping ]

No, it's working.

Uh...
[ scoffs ]

Wait a minute,
how did you know --
$3,000?

[ beeping ]

Jesus christ.

[ machine whirring ]

Wait a minute,
a guy at simulation

Got caught by his wife?

Not that many executives
up and leave their wives

For young secretaries.

Usually it's a project
of ours.

We may have to toss
a few crumbs at your man,

You know,
set up a cover story.

A little cheesecake
to draw out the rat.

Cheesecake, right.
He'd go for that.

Jack thought we could say
the big boss had a breakdown

And went back to the land
in jackson hole.

Turns out, fallacy's doing a big
ceo powwow in jackson hole.

We ended up throwing the whole
thing in the river

And it's on
the morning news.

That's not the way
I like to work.

Now,
when you say "cheesecake,"

What exactly
do you have in mind?

And we're probably gonna
have to do the wife, too,

Which is a headache
that nobody needs.

It's always better to let
something sit for a bit

And then toss them a few crumbs,
like I said.

Stick with me here,
rick.

After a few days,
it's always harder

To piece together
the circumstances,

So while you're thinking
things over, think about that.

Think about what?

This is my personal stuff!

You're not allowed to take
my personal stuff.

We're only gonna look at it
for about a half hour.

This is against the law!

Think about a place.

God, you'd think
for $10,000...

You'd have a place
that you could --

Well, that's why
it's only $10,000...

That's my santa!
...Low overhead.

Don't touch me!
Back off!

I am
nowhere near doing this.

Yeah?

Well, if you<i> can't</i> do this,
this is refundable.

Sir!
That's my stuff!

That's my christmas stuff!

Do not touch me again.

I swear to god,
I really hate you, jed!

But, uh,
think of something,

A locker, car,
somewhere hidden,

Where only you
have the key.

[ elevator dings ]

Rick:
Thanks for coming with me.

Oh, no problem.

I want to take a look
at those old records.

Vinyl's really
getting cool again.

It wasn't cool
for a while, huh?

Look, dad, um...

Egmont's gonna make me
pick up trash over christmas

Because I can't find
an internship.

[ sighs ]
hey, come on, come on.

I pay $20,000 a year
for internships?

I don't get that.

Hey!

Sorry.

1-0-2.

Welcome to super storage.
Name?

Rick o'lette.

O...L...E...

L-e-t-t-e.

1-0-2-8-7-5.

[ beeps ]

Elevator "b"...

Fourth floor, second left,
first right, first left.

What?

Elevator "b"...

Fourth floor,
second left...

First right, first left.
I got it, let's go.

You got it?

Mountain-climbing equipment
for a christmas party.

It's wild.

I think
it sounds pretty cool.

It's definitely not cool.

It's just some part of
duke's little speech

To the troops that he gives
every goddamn year.

What do you mean,
"it sounds cool?"

[ elevator dings ]

The party,
it sounds cool.

Why in the world would...

Since when is your dad's
office party cool?

Second left, first right,
second left.

I mean, I would think
that a guy like duke

Would be the last person

That you would think
was cool.

I told you that they need
an intern at image, right?

Well, today
I got an invitation

To their christmas party.

What?

You?

"eve o'lette."

So I was thinking...

That if I go, then maybe
I could talk to bigboss.

What?

You got a...No!

What?

About an internship
for christmas.

What do you mean, "no"?

I mean no.

What do you think I mean?

Well, what, you don't think
I'm good enough?

Good enough?
Good enough?

Hey, hey,
you're good enough.

Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

Listen, I think
that you're too good,

That's what I...

Uh...

Look, I don't want you
working there.

We'd be working
for the same guy.

Eve: What's your problem?

No, no, no,
no, no, no!

[ sighs ]
first left.

So you don't think
I have what it takes.

A trained monkey would have
what it takes.

Thanks, dad.
Here we are.

Okay.

Look...
I don't want you there.

I don't...
Want you working there.

I don't want him
or them inviting you there.

We'll find something
for you to do,

Don't worry about that.

Mm-hmm.

I'm doomed.

[ sighs ]

Hmm.

We really should go through
all this stuff.

Mm-hmm, I guess so.

But not tonight, huh?

The mountain-climbing
equipment is...

Right here.

Oh, yeah.

Records are over here.

Oh, great.

[ groans ]

Oh, man,
look at this stuff.

[ scoffs ]

I don't even remember
being this person.

Ropes...

And carabiners,
and...

All right, let's see.

Wow.

Ooh, tennis.

"blood on the tracks"
and "the white album."

Can I take these home?

Yeah, of course you can.

Since when do you
listen to the beatles?

Since forever --
I love all this stuff.

I do not
like eric clapton.

[ scoffs ]
three eric clapton albums, dad?

Please.

Let me have one of those.

God, your mother and I
used to listen to this

When she was pregnant
with you.

Well, it didn't take.
I hate him.

That's too bad.
He's only a genius.

One of the first dates
we ever went on

Was a clapton concert.

Did you know that?

I borrowed this car
from mike

And we drove out to...
I forget where it was,

But there was a hole
in the upholstery

And I had covered it over
with newspapers,

You know, so that she
wouldn't -- she wouldn't notice.

And um,
she had a white dress on,

And when we stopped to go to
the concert and she got out,

[ laughs ]

It was all down
her dress and...

I've told you this before,
haven't I?

Yeah.

A million times.

[ laughs ]

It's -- it's okay.

"don't talk          "don't talk
so loud."            so loud."

[ sighs ]

It's just that...

[ chuckles ]

...She was so...

I know.

...And you know, what?

That someone from
out of nowhere could just --

They could just...

I think about it
all the time.

Me, too.

For nothing.

[ scoffs ]

For --
for pocket change.

To do that...

For nothing, for nothing.

They just...

It's just...

I know.

She and I could...

We...Were alike.

I used to --

I used to be
a good person.

I know.

I used to --

You still are, dad.

Yeah.

Let's, uh --

Let's get out of here.

Yeah.

You, uh, got --

You got everything?

Yeah.

[ clears throat ]

Hey, I...

[ softly smooches ]

Say, could you
put...Those back,

You know, in the box,
in case I...

What?

Just -- in case I want
to store something or...

Something.

What else would you want
to store in here?

Uh, forget it.

Yeah, just --

Don't worry,
we'll just leave them there.

Let's leave everything.

I'm sorry, forget it.

Forget it.

[ record player thumping ]

[ thumping stops ]

[ exhales ]

[ dialing phone ]

[ telephone ringing ]

Buck: Yes?

Yes.

[ elevator dings ]

May I help you?

I work here.

[ imitating rick ]
I work here.

No scream.

[ sarcastically ]
a-a-ah.

You're getting good.

Yeah. [scoffs ]

What are you doing here?

Wait...

It's gonna be
the christmas party, isn't it?

[ clicks tongue ]

Okay, I'll give you the money
after it's done.

But I don't think that
we should be seen together.

I mean,
if they see you --

Nobody is going to see me.

I don't do the deed,
my friend.

I have someone.
I'm just a go-between.

Yeah, well, I don't want
to hear about this.

Well, you're gonna listen
to this part, rick.

When bigboss is leaving --
don't call him that.

When bigboss
is leaving the p--

Don't call him that!
Whatever, rick, whatever.

You call from this phone

And stay on the line until
he tells you that it's done.

Whatever you do,
just stay on the line.

Got it, stay on the line.

I got to go --
my kid's christmas play.

Now, uh,
you have the keys?

Huh?

Oh...

Here.

Do you need an I.D.
Or something?

The code is
1-0-2-8-7-5.

Just give my name
to the computer guy.

It's t-e.

L-e-t-t-e.

Yep.

These will get
mailed back to you.

You're never gonna see me again,
got it?

Yeah.

Unless, of course,
I don't get my money.

You'll get your money.

Remember, that phone,
stay on the line.

That phone,
stay on the line.

Rick...

Don't look so upset.

You can do this.

[ laughs ]

Duke: You can play hard to get,
little girl,

But you can't hide
from the duke forever.

Yeah.

And when I get you, I'm gonna...

â™ª put it in your mouth â™ª

â™ª in your motherfucking mouth â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna
put it in your mouth â™ª

[ beeps ]

[ inhales sharply ]

No way.

No fucking way.

Rick: No!
No, no, no!

You could
at least tell me why.

No, no, I don't have
to tell you why.

I'm your father, okay?
How's that for "why"?

So I'm just gonna stay at home
and do nothing?

It's just a christmas party.

Rick:
You've never stayed home and
done nothing your whole life.

Go, go out and play
with your slinky girlfriends.

Go to a club,
go to an opium den,

Go out and do
whatever it is that you do

These Saturday nights
that keeps you out

Till 4:00
in the morning.

There's just one place
that I don't want you to go.

And I don't care
who the hell invited you,

No, no, no, no!

Why?

All right,
you want to know why?

You really want to know why?

Yeah.

Because I said so.

[ sighs ]

Looking good, man.

Right back at you.

I got a cab
right here for you.

You better bundle up,
mr. O'lette.

It's gonna be a cold one
out there tonight.

The mountain...Of success.

[ crowd murmurs ]

Rick.

Whew.

As this year
draws to a close --

And what a year it has been,
I think we can all agree.

Yeah.      Yeah.
Yeah.                      Yeah.

I would like everyone here
to picture themselves

At the base of a very tall
and very beautiful mountain --

The mountain...

Of success.

[ applause ]

[ elevator dings ]

I need to go.

No!
Why don't you go with me?

Tim is gonna be there.

Tim?
No, I need to go to the party.

A stupid office party?

I'm going to do
my intern thing.

Okay, and you're gonna start
by party crashing?

It's a christmas party, okay?
No one cares.

Yeah?
Well, I care!

I have to get a cab.

On this expedition,
like any other,

Teamwork will be required,

Which I like to define as
"people working together."

Yeah.

There's a certain amount
of risk involved,

But the rewards are greater

Than any of you
can possibly imagine.

So today, as we reach
what I like to call

"the holiday season,"

Let's make the decision to climb
the mountain together.

Yeah.      Yeah.
Yeah.                      Yeah.

Let's help each other
through the rough patches.

Let's show each other
where the handholds are.

Yeah!

Let's use our teamwork
to its fullest potential.

Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!              Whoo-hoo!

And I promise you

That we will reach
the mountain's highest peak...

Yeah!      Yeah!
Yeah!                      Yeah!

All right!

Yeah!                      Yeah!

Go on up, bigboss!

Let's start climbing!

...Where we will
proudly plant...

The flag of image.

[ cheers and applause ]

And I hope you will have enough
faith in me, your team leader,

To tie your ropes to mine.

[ cheers and applause ]

All right, rope us up.

Image!

Yeah, all right!

Who's next
with the bigboss?

Where are you going?

[ smooches ]

Hey,
where's your husband?

Let's go grab a drink,
shall we, dick?

It's, uh, rick, maura.

It's nora, nick.

You know,
you always seem

To have a head
on your shoulders.

Thanks,
but your husband,

He's got a head on his
shoulders, too, for now.

Have you seen
my daughter?

No, but I would love to.

I had no idea
you had any children.

Just her.
Just the one, eve.

That's all I got,
really.

She's kind of
a lightweight.

Well, you know,
the three of you

Should come out to the cape
with us sometime.

That would be hell on earth,
maura.

[ dance music playing ]

[ laughs ]

Oh, hey, rick,
here's to you.

Come on.
Hey, hey, whoa!

Man: Oh, rick,
saved the day, buddy!

Uh...

Hey, I came here with my
daughter, a blonde, about --

You have a family?

Oh, was that girl
with you, rick?

I saw her. Do you want me
to go get her for you?

You saw her?

Yeah, you want me
to go get her for you?

Would you?

Sure, no problem.
Just don't move.

Don't you move.

I won't. Thanks.

Jane.

[ eve giggling ]

Eve, eve, eve.

[ chuckles ]

I'm so glad you showed up.

Yeah.

These office people
do not know how to party.

Jed?
Have you seen duke?

Did you see what she did?

Yeah, yeah, but duke,

She just dropped

What?
No, duke, have you seen duke?!

Duke?

Get your act together.
Whew.

[ sighs ]

Well, here we are.

Okay.

[ smooches ]

Yeah.

I don't...Know.

What don't you know?

[ laughs ]

Well, it's

Aren't you "vixxxen"?

What?

With three "x"s?

How -- how did you --

Yoo-hoo!

Where is rick's naughty,

Oh, sorry, ken.

[ laughter ]

Hey, hi, how are you?

Whoo-hoo!

Fine.

You're the new receptionist,

Well, for now.

I mean, I'm trying to
finish my masters.

Really?
That's great.

I really want to
work with children.

Oh, fantastic.

Speaking of children,
have you seen duke?

Duke?

Yeah, the boss.

Duke.

Duke, the person
who is your boss.

Where is he?
Have you seen him?

Jesus, sorry.
Uh, duke just left.

He left?

He just left.
He just went down the elevators.

He said he was going home.
He left?

He went

Excuse me.

Oh, oh, wait,

He's just left.

The customer is leaving

The customer?
What?

The customer is leaving

No, he's already left.

I mean,
he's going down now.

It's okay. We're stationed
just outside the door.

We're ready to deliver the goods
to the customer.

I'm doomed.

Duke: What?

What?

[ clears throat ]

Look, I, uh...

Are you all right?

I'm fine, I just...

I think I should go.

I think I need to leave.

What is
the customer wearing?

Are you really there?
I don't see you.

What is
the customer wearing?

I don't, uh --

Yellow windbreaker,

Mountain-climbing

Yellow windbreaker,

Got it.

Look...

I'll call you, or, uh...

E-mail me?

Yeah.

[ sighs ]

I think I'm gonna just...

[ clears throat ]

...See you around
or something.

What, don't you want
to wait for rick?

My dad's probably too mad
to see me right now.

Your dad?

All right, mr. O'lette,
stay on the line.

We'll tell you
when it gets done.

Okay.

That will serve
as a receipt.

A receipt?

"hell on earth"?

Isn't that

I said, "you and your family
should with us to the cape,"

And you said, "that would be
hell on earth."

I was thinking that, so I might
have said that, yeah.

You think
I didn't hear you?

You guys think
no one hears you

When you...

Forget it.

[ elevator dings ]

[ door opens ]

[ door closes ]

How much...

Older are you

And you --

You know, duke...

Believe it or not...

A nice person.

Listen, I wanted to tell you

You bringing in the

Why don't you come by
the office some --

[ elevator dings ]

[ panting ]

O'lette, rick o'lette.

Rick o'lette.

Rick o'lette?

Hey,
weren't you just here?

1-0-2-8-7-5.

[ computer beeps ]

Elevator "b," fourth floor,

Second left, first right,
first left.

But listen, I got to close
in a few minutes.

The new girl who's supposed to
be here hasn't shown up yet.

Elevator "b."

Elevator "b,"
fourth floor --

Hey, but I got to go!

[ grunting ]

You're late.

[ banging ]

What's that noise?

[ grunts ]

Ah!

God damn it.

Oh!

Man: Hey!
Are you down there?

Where are you?

Hey!

What the hell is going on?

[ gasps ]

Hey...

Uh...I...

She...

Oh, jesus.

[ sobbing and panting ]

[ yawns ]

Mr. O'lette?

Where did you come from?

I didn't see you come in.

[ elevator dings ]

I told you
you should have bundled up.

Are you going up,
mr. O'lette?

Suit yourself.

Looking good.

Right back at you.

[ elevator dings ]

â™ª someone's got it in for me â™ª

â™ª they're planting stories
in the press â™ª

â™ª whoever it is I wish
they'd cut it out quick â™ª

â™ª but when they will â™ª

â™ª I can only guess â™ª

â™ª they say I shot a man
named gray â™ª

â™ª and took his wife to Italy â™ª

â™ª she inherited
a million bucks â™ª

â™ª and when she died,
it came to me â™ª

â™ª I can't help it if I'm lucky â™ª

â™ª idiot wind â™ª

â™ª blowing every time
you move your mouth â™ª

â™ª blowing down the back roads â™ª

â™ª headin' south â™ª

â™ª idiot wind â™ª

â™ª blowing every time
you move your teeth â™ª

â™ª you're an idiot, babe â™ª

â™ª it's a wonder that you still
know how to breathe â™ª

â™ª I ran into
the fortune-teller â™ª

â™ª who said, "beware of lightning
that might strike" â™ª

â™ª I haven't known
peace and quiet â™ª

â™ª for so long, I can't remember
what it's like â™ª

â™ª there's a lone soldier
on the cross â™ª

â™ª smoke pourin'
out of a boxcar door â™ª

â™ª you didn't know it â™ª

â™ª you didn't think
it could be done â™ª

â™ª in the final end,
he won the war â™ª

â™ª after losing every battle â™ª

â™ª I woke up on the roadside â™ª

â™ª daydreamin' 'bout the way
things sometimes are â™ª

â™ª visions of
your chestnut mare â™ª

â™ª shoot through my head â™ª

â™ª and are makin' me see stars â™ª

â™ª you hurt the ones
that I love best â™ª

â™ª and cover up the truth
with lies â™ª

â™ª one day you'll be
in the ditch â™ª

â™ª flies buzzin'
around your eyes â™ª

â™ª blood on your saddle â™ª

â™ª idiot wind â™ª

â™ª blowing through the flowers
on your tomb â™ª

â™ª blowing through the curtains
in your room â™ª

â™ª idiot wind â™ª

â™ª blowing every time
you move your teeth â™ª

â™ª you're an idiot, babe â™ª

â™ª it's a wonder that you still
know how to breathe â™ª

â™ª it was gravity
which pulled us down â™ª

â™ª and destiny
which broke us apart â™ª

â™ª you tamed the lion
in my cage â™ª

â™ª but it just wasn't enough
to change my heart â™ª

â™ª now everything's
a little upside down â™ª

â™ª as a matter of fact,
the wheels have stopped â™ª

â™ª what's good is bad,
what's bad is good â™ª

â™ª you'll find out
when you reach the top â™ª

â™ª you're on the bottom â™ª

â™ª idiot wind â™ª

â™ª blowing through the buttons
of our coats â™ª

â™ª blowing through the letters
that we wrote â™ª

â™ª idiot wind â™ª

â™ª blowing through the dust
upon our shelves â™ª

â™ª we're idiots, babe â™ª

â™ª it's a wonder we can
even feed ourselves â™ª
