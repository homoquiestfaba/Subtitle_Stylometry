We're under attack!
Light the signal!

Now all of China
knows you're here.

Perfect.

Your Majesty, the Huns
have crossed our northern border.

Impossible. No one
can get through the Great Wall.

Shan-Yu is leading them.

We'll set up defences
around your palace immediately.

No. Send your troops
to protect my people.

Chi Fu.
Yes, Your Highness?

Deliver conscription notices
throughout all the provinces.

Call up reserves and
as many new recruits as possible.

Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I believe my troops can stop him.

I won't take
any chances, General.

A single grain of rice
can tip the scale.

One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.

"Quiet and demure.

"Graceful. Polite. Delicate.

"Refilned. Poised.

Punctual."

Ai-yah!
Little Brother!

Little Brother. Lit...

Ah! There you are.

Who's the smartest doggy in
the world? Come on, smart boy.

Can you help me
with my chores today?

Honourable ancestors...

please help Mulan
impress the Matchmaker today.

Please.

Please help her.

Father, I brought your... Whoa!
Mulan.

I brought a spare.
Mulan...

Remember, the doctor said
three cups of tea in the morning...

Mulan.
and three at night.

Mulan, you should already be in town.
We are counting on you to...

To uphold the family honour.

Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

Wish me luck.
Hurry!

I'm going to
pray some more.

Fa Li, is your daughter
here yet?

The Matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

Of all days to be late... I should
have prayed to the ancestors for luck.

How lucky can they be?
They're dead.

Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.

This is your chance
to prove yourself.

Grandma, no!

Yep, this cricket's
a lucky one!

I'm here.

What? But, Mama,
I had to...

None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

This is what you give me
to work with

Well, honey
I've seen worse

We're gonna turn
this sow's ear

Into a silk purse
It's freezing.

It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

We'll have you
washed and dried

Primped and polished
till you glow with pride

Trust my recipe
for instant bride

You'll bring honour
to us all

Mulan, what's this?
Uh, notes...

in case
I forget something.

Hold this. We'll need
more luck than I thought.

Wait and see
when we're through

Boys will gladly
go to war for you

With good fortune
And a great hairdo

You'll bring honour
to us all

A girl can bring
her family

Great honour in one way

By striking
a good match

And this could be
the day

Men want girls with good taste
Calm.

Obedient.
Who work fast-paced

With good breeding
And a tiny waist

You'll bring honour
to us all

We all must serve
our emperor

Who guards us
from the Huns

A man by bearing arms

A girl by bearing sons

When we're through you can't fail
When we're through

Like a lotus blossom, soft and pale
You can't fail, like a lotus blossom
When we're through, you can't fail

How could any fellow say no sale
Soft and pale, how could any fellow
Like a lotus blossom, soft and pale

You'll bring honour to us all
Say no sale, you'll bring honour
How could any fellow say no sale

To us all
You'll bring honour to us all

There. You're ready.

Not yet.
An apple for serenity.

A pendant for balance.

Beads ofjade

For beauty

You must proudly

Show it

Now add a cricket

just for luck

And even you can't blow it

Ancestors, hear my plea

Help me not to make a fool of me

And to not uproot my family tree

Keep my father standing tall

Scarier than the undertaker

We are meeting our Matchmaker

Destiny
Guard our girls

And our future
as it fast unfurls

Please look kindly
on these cultured pearls

Each a perfect
porcelain doll

Please bring honour to us
Please bring honour to us

Please bring honour to us
Please bring honour to us

Please bring honour
to us all

"Fa Mulan."
Present!

Speaking without permission.

Oops.
Who spit in her bean curd?

Mmm. Too skinny.

Hmph! Not good
for bearing sons.

Recite the filnal admonition.

Well?

Fulfill your duties
calmly and respectfully.

Um, reflect before you snack...

Act! This shall bring you
honour and glory.

Hmm. This way.

Now, pour the tea.

To please
your future in-laws...

you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity...

and refilnement.

You must also be poised.

Um, pardon me.
And silent!

Could I just
take that back for a moment?

Why, you clumsy...

I think it's going well,
don't you?

Put it out! Put it out!
Put it out!

You are a disgrace!

You may look like a bride...

but you will never
bring your family honour!

Look at me

I will never pass

For a perfect bride

Or a perfect daughter

Can it be

I'm not meant
to play this part

Now I see

That if I were truly
to be myself

I would break
my family's heart

Who is that girl I see

Staring straight

Back at me

Why is my reflection

Someone I

Don't know

Somehow I cannot hide

Who I am

Though I've tried

When will
my reflection show

Who I am

Inside

When will
my reflection show

Who I am

Inside

My, my.

What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

But, look,
this one's late.

But I'll bet that
when it blooms...

it will be
the most beautiful of all.

What is it?

Mulan, stay inside.

Citizens, I bring
a proclamation...

from the lmperial City.

The Huns have invaded China.

By order of the emperor...

one man from every family
must serve in the lmperial Army.

The Hsiao family.

The Yi family.

I will serve the emperor
in my father's place.

The Fa family.
No!

I am ready to serve
the emperor.

Father, you can't go.
Mulan!

Please, sir, my father
has already fought bravely...

Silence!
You would do well...

to teach your daughter to hold
her tongue in a man's presence.

Mulan, you dishonour me.

Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.

Yes, sir.

The Chu family!

The Wen family!

The Chang family!

You shouldn't have to go!
Mulan...

There are plenty of young men
to filght for China.

It is an honour to protect
my country and my family.

So, you'll die for honour.

I will die doing what's right.
But if you...

I know my place!
It is time you learned yours.

Mulan is gone!
What?

It can't be.

Mulan!

No.

You must go after her.
She could be killed.

If I reveal her...

she will be.

Ancestors, hear our prayer.

Watch over Mulan.

Mushu, awaken.

I live!

So tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.

You just say the word and I'm there.
Mushu...

And let me say somethin'.
Anybody who's foolish enough...

to threaten our family,
vengeance will be mine!

Mushu!
These are the family guardians.

They...
Protect the family.

And you, O Demoted One?

I ring the gong.

That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.

One family reunion
comin' right up.

Okay, people, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

Let's move it. Rise and shine. Y'all way
past the beauty sleep thing, trust me.

I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan
was a troublemaker from the start!

Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.

She's just trying
to help her father.

But if she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

Dishonour will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.

Not to mention,
they'll lose the farm.

My children never caused such trouble.
They all became acupuncturists.

Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.
No!

Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

Let a guardian bring her back.
Yes, awaken the most cunning.

No. The swiftest.

No. Send the wisest.
Silence!

We must send
the most powerful of all.

Okay, okay, I get
the drift. I'll go.

Oh, y'all don't think
I can do it. Watch this here.

Aha! Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?

Don't make me have to singe
nobody to prove no point.

You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

Your misguidance led
Fa Deng to disaster.

Yeah, thanks a lot.
And your point is?

The point is we will be
sending a real dragon...

to retrieve Mulan.

What... What...
I'm a real dragon!

You are not worthy of this spot.
Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.

So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

Just one chance,
is that too much to ask?

I mean, it's not like
it'll kill ya.

Yo, Rocky, wake up!
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!

Come on.

Hello? Hello!

Hello!

Uh, Stony?

Stony? Oh, man,
they're gonna kill me.

Great Stone Dragon...

have you awakened?

Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yes, I just woke up.

I'm... I'm the Great Stone Dragon.
Good morning.

I will go forth
and fetch Mulan.

Did... Did I mention that
I was the Great Stone Dragon?

Go! The fate
of the Fa family...

rests in your claws.

Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

Oh, my elbow. Oh, oh.
I know I twisted something.

That's just great.
Now what? I'm doomed!

And all 'cause Miss Man decides to take
her little drag show on the road.

Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

After this Great Stone
Humpty-Dumpty mess...

I'd have to bring her home
with a medal to get back in the temple.

Wait a minute. That's it!
I make Mulan a war hero...

and they'll be begging me
to come back to work.

That's the master plan.
Aw, you done it now, man.

Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

You're lucky?

Do I look like a sucker to you?

What you mean, a loser? How 'bout
if I pop one of your antennas off,
and throw it across the yard?

Then who's the loser,
me or you?

Imperial scouts.

Shan-Yu.

Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun Army.

The emperor will stop you.

Stop me? He invited me.

By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

Well, I'm here
to play his game.

Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

I'm ready.

How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

One.

Okay, okay,
how about this?

Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?

Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one too.

They're very manly
and tough.

I'm working on it!

Oh, who am I fooling?

It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

Did I hear someone ask
for a miracle?

Let me hear you say "aaah"!
Aaah!

That's close enough.
A ghost.

Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

For I have been sent
by your ancestors...

to guide you through
your masquerade.

Come on. If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
filnds out you're a girl...

the penalty is death!

Who are you?
Who am I? Who am I?

I am the guardian
of lost souls.

I am the powerful,
the pleasurable...

the indestructible Mushu.

Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

Hey, dragon, dragon,
not lizard.

I don't do that tongue thing.

You're, um...
Intimidating?

Awe-inspiring?
Tiny.

Of course. I'm travel-size
for your convenience.

If I was my real size,
your cow here would die of fright.

Down, Bessie. My powers are beyond
your mortal imagination.

For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armour. Oooh!

All right, that's it! Dishonour!
Dishonour on your whole family.

Make a note of this. Dishonour on you,
dishonour on your cow, dis...

Stop. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't you slap me no more.

We clear on that?
All right.

Okey-dokey. Let's get this show
on the road! Cri-Kee, get the bags.

Let's move it, heifer.

Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

Two, three... Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

Beautiful, isn't he?
They're disgusting.

No, they're men. Now, you gonna have
to act just like them, so pay attention.

Look. This tattoo
will protect me from harm.

I hope you can
get your money back.

I don't think
I can do this.

It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

What are you lookin' at?
Punch him. It's how men say hello.

Oh, Yao,
you've made a friend.

Good. Now slap him on the behind.
They like that.

I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

Yao, relax
and chant with me.

Feel better?
Yeah.

Ahh, you ain't
worth my time, chicken boy.

Chicken boy? Say that
to my face, ya limp noodle!

Oh. Sorry, Ling.

Hey!

Whoa! You're dead!

Oh, there he goes!

Hey, guys.

The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

and stop Shan-Yu
before he destroys this village.

Excellent strategy, sir.

I do love surprises.

You will stay and train
the new recruits.

When Chi Fu believes
you're ready...

you will join us, Captain.

Captain?

This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

Uh, perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

Number one in his class, extensive
knowledge of training techniques...

an impressive
military lineage.

I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.

Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is... I mean...

Yes, sir.
Very good, then.

We'll toast China's victory
at the lmperial City.

I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

And I won't leave
anything out.

Captain Li Shang.

Leader of China's
filnest troops.

No. The greatest troops
of all time.

Most impressive.

Good luck, Captain. Hyah!

Good luck, Father.

Day one.

Soldiers!

He started it!

I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

Sorry. Uh...

I mean, uh, sorry you had to see that,
but you know how it is...

when you get those manly urges
and you just gotta kill somethin'...

filx things, cook outdoors...

What's your name?
Uh... l, l, uh...

Your commanding offilcer
just asked you a question.

Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name too.

Ling. How 'bout Ling?
His name is Ling.

I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
Ah Chu.

Ah Chu?
Gesundheit. Ha, ha. I kill myself.

Mushu.
Mushu?

No.
Then what is it?

Ping was my best friend growin' up.
It's Ping.

Ping?
Of course, Ping did steal my...

Yes, my name is Ping.

Let me see your
conscription notice.

Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

Um, he-he doesn't talk
about me much.

I can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.

Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping...

you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

And tomorrow,
the real work begins.

You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

All right! Rise and shine,
Sleeping Beauty.

Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

Get your clothes on. Get ready.
Got breakfast for ya.

Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

Am I late?
No time to talk. Now remember, it's...

your filrst day of trainin', so listen
to your teacher and no filghtin'...

play nice with the other kids, unless,
of course, one of the other kids...

wanna filght, then you have to
kick the other kid's butt.

But I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.

Don't talk with your mouth full.
Now let's see your war face.

Oh, I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

Come on! Scare me, girl.

Yeah, that's my tough-lookin' warrior.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

Now, get out there
and make me proud.

What do you mean, the troops just left?
They what?

Wait!
You forgot your sword.

My little baby,
off to destroy people.

Order. People, order.

I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
Oh, oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.

Moo goo gai pan.
That's not funny.

Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?

Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

Soldiers!

You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

Anyone who acts otherwise
will answer to me.

Ooh. Tough guy.

Yao.

Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

I'll get that arrow,
pretty boy...

and I'll do it
with my shirt on.

One moment. You seem
to be missing something.

This represents discipline...

and this represents strength.

You need both to reach the arrow.

We've got a long way to go.

Let's get down to business

To defeat the Huns

Did they send me daughters

When I asked for sons

You're the saddest bunch
I ever met

But you can bet
before we're through

Mister, I'll make a man

Out of you

Tranquil as a forest

But on fire within

Once you find your centre

You are sure to win

You're a spineless
pale, pathetic lot

And you haven't got a clue

Somehow I'll make a man

Out of you

I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say goodbye to those who knew me

Boy, was I a fool
in school for cutting gym

This guy's got 'em
scared to death

Hope he doesn't see
right through me

Now I really wish
that I knew how to swim

Be a man
You must be swift as a coursing river

Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon

Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire

Mysterious as the dark side of

The moon

Time is racing toward us

Till the Huns arrive

Heed my every order

And you might survive

You're unsuited for
the rage of war

So pack up, go home
You're through

How could I make a man

Out of you
Be a man

You must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man

With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man

With all the strength
of a raging fire

Mysterious as
the dark side of

The moon
Be a man

We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man

With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man

With all the strength
of a raging fire

Mysterious as
the dark side of

The moon

What do you see?

Black pine,
from the high mountains.

White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.

Sulphur, from cannons.

This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass...

where the lmperial Army
is waiting for us.

We can avoid them easily.

No. The quickest way
to the emperor is through that pass.

And besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.

We should return it to her.

Hey, no, this is not a good idea.
What if somebody sees you?

Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.

So a couple of guys don't rinse out
their socks. Picky, picky, picky.

Well, myself, I kind of
like that corn chip smell.

Okay, all right, all right.
That's enough. Now, come on, get out
before you get all pruny and stuff.

Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.

Yeah, yeah.
"Stand watch, Mushu...

while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits."

Pfft! Hygiene!

Me filrst! Me filrst!
Oh!

We're doomed! There are a couple of
things I know they're bound to notice!

Hey, Ping!

Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

I was just washing. So now I'm clean,
and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

Come back here.
I know we were jerks to you before...

so let's start over.

Hi. I'm Ling.

And I'm Chien-Po.
Hello, Chien-Po.

And I am Yao!

King of the rock!

And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.

Oh, yeah? Well, I think
Ping and I can take you.

I really don't wanna take him anywhere.
Ping, we have to filght!

No, we don't.
Uh, we, uh, could just...

close our eyes and swim around.

Come on.
Don't be such a gir...

Ouch! Something bit me!

What a nasty flavour.
Snake!

Snake! Ooh, ooh!
Ah, poison!

Oooh, snake! Snake!

Snake! Snake!
Help! Help!

Some king of the rock.
Aaah!

Boy, that was close.
No, that was vile.

You owe me big.

I never want to see
a naked man again.

Hey, don't look at me.
I ain't bitin' no more butts.

You think your troops
are ready to filght?

Ha! They would not
last a minute against the Huns!

They completed their training.
Those boys...

are no more filt to be soldiers
than you are to be captain.

Once the general
reads my report...

your troops
will never see battle.

Oh, no, you don't! I've worked
too hard to get Mulan into this war.

This guy's messin'
with my plan.

We're not filnished!
Be careful, Captain.

The general may be your father,
but I am the emperor's counsel.

And, oh, by the way,
I got that job on my own.

You're dismissed.

Hey. I'll hold him
and you punch.

Or not.

For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

I saw that.
What?

You like him, don't you?
No! l...

Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.
Go to your tent!

I think it's time we took
this war into our own hands.

Okay, let me see what you got.
"From General Li.

"Dear Son, we're
waiting for Huns at the pass.

It would mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up."

Hmm. That's great, except you forgot,
"And since we're out of potpourri...

perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing up some."

Hello! This is the army!
Make it sound more urgent, please!

You know what
I'm talkin' about?

That's better.
Much better. Let's go.

Khanny, baby.
Hey, we need a ride.

Insubordinate ruffilans!

You men owe me
a new pair of slippers!

And I do not squeal
like a girl.

Urgent news
from the general.

What's the matter? You've never
seen a black-and-white before?

Who are you?

Excuse me? I think
the question is, who are you?

We're in a war, man! There's
no time for stupid questions!

I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

Captain, urgent news from the general!
We're needed at the front.

Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.

For a long time
we've been marching off to battle

In our thundering herd
we feel a lot like cattle

Like a pounding beat
our aching feet

Aren't easy to ignore

Hey!
Think of instead

A girl worth fighting for

Huh?
That's what I said.

A girl worth fighting for

I want her paler
than the moon

With eyes that shine
like stars

My girl will marvel
at my strength

Adore my battle scars

I couldn't care less what she'll wear
or what she looks like

It all depends on
what she cooks like

Beef, pork, chicken
Mmm

Bet the local girls
thought you were quite the charmer

And I'll bet the ladies
love a man in armour

You can guess what
we have missed the most

Since we went off to war

What do we want
A girl worth fighting for

My girl will think
I have no faults

That I'm a major find

Uh, how 'bout a girl
who's got a brain

Who always speaks her mind
Nah!

My manly ways
and turn of phrase

Are sure to thrill her

He thinks he's
such a lady-killer

I've a girl back home
who's unlike any other

Yeah, the only girl
who'd love him is his mother

But when we come home
in victory

They'll line up at the door

What do we want
A girl worth fighting for

Wish that I had
A girl worth fighting for

A girl worth fighting

Search for survivors.

I don't understand.
My father should've been here.

Captain!

The general.

I'm sorry.

The Huns
are moving quickly.

We'll make better time to the lmperial
City through the Tung Shao Pass.

We're the only hope
for the emperor now.

Move out!

What happened?
Um...

You just gave away
our position! Now we're...

Get out of range!

Save the cannons!
Come on!

Empty it! Empty it!

Hey!

Oh, sure.
Save the horse.

Fire!

Fire!

Hold the last cannon.

Prepare to filght.
If we die, we die with honour.

Yao, aim the cannon
at Shan-Yu.

Hey!
Ping! Come back!

Ping!

Stop!

All right. You might want
to light that right about now.

Quickly. Quickly!

Come on!
We gotta help!

You missed!
How could you miss?

He was three feet
in front of you!

Mulan!

Mulan!

Mulan?

No.

Mulan!

Man, you are
one lucky bug.

Shang!

Do you see them?
Yes.

Perfect. Now we'll
pull them to safety.

Hey, Mulan!
I found the lucky cricket!

We need help.

Ooh, nice. Very nice.
You can sit by me.

We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
We are defilnitely gonna die.

No way we survive this.
Death is coming!

I let them slip
through my filngers.

Pull!

Whoa!

Oh, I knew we could do it.
You the man!

Well, sort of.

Step back, guys.
Give him some air.

Ping?

You are the craziest man
I've ever met.

And for that,
I owe you my life.

From now on,
you have my trust.

Let's hear it for Ping!
The bravest of us all!

You're king of the mountain!
Yes, yes, yes!

Ping! What's wrong?

He's wounded! Get help!

Ping, hold on.

Hold on.

I can explain.

So it's true!

Shang!

I knew there was
something wrong with you.

A woman!

Treacherous snake!

My name is Mulan.

I did it
to save my father.

High treason!
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

Ultimate dishonour!

It was the only way.
Please believe me.

Captain?

Restrain him!

No!
You know the law.

A life for a life.
My debt is repaid.

Move out!
Uh, uh... But you can't just...

I said, "Move out."

I was this close.

This close
to impressin' the ancestors...

gettin' the top shelf,
an entourage.

Man. All my filne work.
Pfft.

Hi.
I should never have left home.

Hey, come on. You went
to save your father's life.

Who knew you'd end up shamin' him
and disgracing your ancestors...

and losin' all your friends?

You know, you just gotta...
You gotta learn to let these things go.

Maybe I didn't go
for my father.

Maybe what I really wanted was
to prove I could do things right...

so when I looked
in the mirror...

I'd see someone worthwhile.

But I was wrong.

I see nothing.

Now, that's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.

Let me shine this up for ya.

I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

The truth is,
we're both frauds.

Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

l-I risked your life
to help myself.

At least
you had good intentions.

What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?

You lied to me?

And what are you, a sheep?

I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

Let's go home.
Yeah.

This ain't gonna be pretty.

But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll filnish it.

I promise.

Uh, home is that way.

I have to do something.
Did you see those Huns?

They popped out of the snow
like daisies!

Are we in this together
or not?

Well, let's go kick
some Hunny buns!

Make way for
the heroes of China.

Shang!
Mulan?

The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

You don't belong here,
Mulan. Go home.

Shang, I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

Why should I?

Why else would I come back?

You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!

Now, where are you going?
To filnd someone who will believe me.

My children,
heaven smiles down...

upon the Middle Kingdom.

China will sleep
safely tonight...

thanks to
our brave warriors.

Sir, the emperor's in danger.

But the Huns are here.

Please, you have to help.

No one will listen.
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

Did you say something?
Mushu.

Hey, you're a girl again,
remember?

Your Majesty...

I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

I know what this means
to you, Captain Li.

Your father would have been
very proud.

No!
Come on!

They'll never reach
the emperor in time.

Hey, guys!
I've got an idea.

Be a man

We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man

With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man

With all the strength
of a raging fire

Mysterious as
the dark side of

The moon

Boo.

Guard the door.

Your walls and armies
have fallen...

and now it's your turn.

Bow to me.

Okay. Any questions?
Does this dress make me look fat?

Who's there?

Concubines.
Ugly concubines.

Oh, he's so cute!

Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

Shang, go!

I tire of your arrogance,
old man. Bow to me!

No matter how the wind howls...

the mountain cannot bow to it.

Then you will kneel in pieces!

Chien-Po, get the emperor!

Sorry, Your Majesty.

No!

Come on!

No.

You!

You took away my victory!
No!

I did.

The soldier from the mountains.

So what's the plan?
Um...

You don't have a plan?
Hey, I'm making this up as I go.

Mushu!
Way ahead of you, sister.

Come on, Cri-Kee.

Citizens, I need filrepower.
Who are you?

Your worst nightmare.

On the roof!
Look!

It looks like
you're out of ideas.

Not quite. Ready, Mushu?

I am ready, baby!
Light me.

Get off the roof,
get off the roof, get off the roof.

You are a lucky bug.

That was a deliberate
attempt on my life!

Where is she?
Now she's done it.

What a mess!
Stand aside!

That creature's
not worth protecting.

She's a hero.
'Tis a woman.

She'll never be worth anything.
Listen, you pompous...

That is enough.

Your Majesty, I can explain.

I've heard a great deal
about you, Fa Mulan.

You stole your father's armour,
ran away from home...

impersonated a soldier...

deceived
your commanding offilcer...

dishonoured the Chinese Army,
destroyed my palace...

and...

you have saved us all.

My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.

You have a tissue?

Chi Fu?
Your Excellency?

See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

Uh, a member... What?
Uh... But...

There are no council positions
open, Your Majesty.

Very well.
You can have his job.

What? l... Oh.

With all due respect,
Your Excellency...

I think I've been away
from home long enough.

Then take this...

so your family will know
what you have done for me.

And this...

so the world will know
what you have done for China.

Is she allowed to do that?

Um... You...

You filght good.

Oh. Thank you.

Khan, let's go home.

The flower that blooms
in adversity...

is the most rare
and beautiful of all.

Sir?
You don't meet a girl like that...

every dynasty.

Mulan!
Father.

I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

And the crest
of the emperor.

They're gifts
to honour the Fa family.

The greatest gift and honour...

is having you for a daughter.

I've missed you so.

I've missed you too, Baba.

Great.
She brings home a sword.

If you ask me,
she should've brought home a man.

Excuse me.
Does Fa Mulan live here?

Thank you.
Whoo! Sign me up for the next war.

Honourable Fa Zhou, l...
Mulan!

Uh, you forgot your helmet.

Uh, w-w-well, actually, it's, uh,
your helmet, isn't it? I mean...

Would you like to stay
for dinner?

Would you like
to stay forever?

Dinner would be great.

Come on.
Who did a good job?

Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

Take it, Cri-Kee!

You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

Call out for egg rolls!

Guardians.

Oh.
Thanks, Mushu.

Mushu!

Whenever you feel your world
is crashin'down on you

Whenever you don't know
where to turn or what to do

Don't look too far

You've got the guide

To find your way

Let your heart decide

Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

That's when the heavens will part

And show the world
what you believe in

Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

And when you're true to your heart

Then you've got all you need
to make it through
Be true

To your heart

Ah, someone you know
is on your side

Can set you free

I can do that for you
if you believe in me

Why second guess

What feels so right

just trust your heart

And you'll see the light

Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

That's when
the heavens will part

And show the world
what you believe in

Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

And when you're true
to your heart

Then you've got all you need
to make it through

You know it's true
It'll see you through

Yeah, yeah
You've got to be true

Baby

To your heart

Be true to your heart
You must be true to your heart

That's when the heavens will part

And show the world
what you believe in

Open your eyes

And you don't know

True to your heart

You've got to be true

To your heart

Got to be true

Be true
True, true, true, true

To your heart

Look at me

You may think you see
who I really am

But you'll never know me

Every day

It's as if I play a part

Now I see

If I wear a mask
I can fool the world

But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see

Staring straight back at me

When will my reflection show

Who I am inside

I am now

In a world where
I have to hide my heart

And what I believe in

But somehow

I will show the world

What's inside my heart

And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see

Staring straight back at me

Why is my reflection

Someone I don't know

Must I pretend that I'm

Someone else for all time

When will my reflection show

Who I am

Inside, there's a heart

That must be free

To fly

And I burn

With a need to know

The reason why

Why must we all conceal

What we think
How we feel

Must there be a secret me

I'm forced to hide

I won't pretend that I'm

Someone else for all time

When will my reflection show

Who I am inside

When will my reflection show

Who I am inside

Oh, hey, yeah
