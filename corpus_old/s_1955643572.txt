             So, how old are you
             anyway, Billy?     

   Oh, it's Robby,              
   actually.                    

   Robby Katzen,                
   but you can call me          
   Billy if you want.           

         - And I'm 20.          
         - 20?                  

              ( forced laugh )  
              So what do you do?

      - You work, you go        
        to school or what?      
      - I go to school.         

         - High school?         
         - College.             

       - Bullshit.              
       - No, it's not           
         bullshit at all.       

As a matter of fact,            
I currently attend              
the University of Minnesota.    

       Look, you don't have     
       to bullshit me, you know?

         I see guys like you    
         in here all the time:  

         Minnesota, high school,
         fake IDs.              

        You ain't 18 and you    
        don't have to lie to me.

        You're probably         
        gonna get some anyway.  

           I am?                

                Hey, come on!   
                Off the car!    

         - ( chuckles )         
         - Jesus!               

                Sorry...        

Oh, my boyfriend                
goes to Yale.                   

I think that is just            
too cool for school.            

   - Hey, listen--              
   - You know who goes there?   

        - Yale, I mean?         
        - Who?                  

         Claire Danes.          

       - Do you know her?       
       - No.                    

          Do you think          
        I look like her?        

            I mean,             
      not the hair, but...      

      Yeah, just like her.      

        I could get used        
to the way that you talk to me. 

          I gotta get           
     outta here, you know?      

        I gotta get out         
   of this place, this life.    

     Where is Yale, anyway?     

      It's in Connecticut.      

       That's far enough.

             How did you get it?

     It's okay, you can tell me.
     I'm studying to be a nurse.

       - I love nurses.         
       - ( both chuckle )

         -<i> ( unzips )</i>           
         - Oh, finally.         

    Okay, so, I had             
    this dog Rinny.             

    And when my parents         
    had a baby,                 

  Rinny got a little jealous,   
  ripped into me, teeth         
  and claws--                   

    the whole antiseptic        
    hospital drama.             

    I knew my old man           
    was gonna kill him,         

  <i> so I set Rinny free.</i>         

            That's just about   
            the kindest thing   
            I have ever heard.  

    Well, I'm watching          
    him run.                    

   And I look up                
   and see in the window        
   the reflection of my face.   

  <i> So I figure, "Why should</i>     
  <i> this goddamn dog</i>             
  <i> get to run free</i>              

  while I gotta walk around     
  looking like this?            

  Like fucking Quasimodo?"      

      So, I shot him...         

      in the eye.               

        Payback.                

         That's the story       
       of C.J. and the dog.     

             What?              

       Hey, maybe I could       
  come and visit you sometime,  

       you know, like you       
      promised last year.       

          Yeah, sure,           
        that'd be great.        

           Tomorrow?            

     I mean, we could just      
     try it out for a while     

     and see what happens.      

            C.J.:               
            Crush your head.    

           Hmm, crush your head.

        Crush your head.        

           Spare you.           
             Cru--              

      - Hey, zipper face.       
      - Zipper face?            

       I can only assume        
    you're referring to me.     

 - What did you say to Denise?  
 - Who?                         

         Don't "Who?"           
         The chick you freaked. 

Did you grab her ass?           

          I would remember that,
          wouldn't I?           

      No, I don't believe I did,
      my fine...                

         corpulent friend.      

        Well, you sure as shit  
        did something 'cause    
        she said you--          

                       Stop!    

  Please, you're about to say   
     what you<i> think</i> I did.      

         I'll deny it.          
     You'll say, "Why don't     
       we step outside?"        

       I'll say, "Okay."        

     <i> Then out there,</i>           
     <i> macho around a little bit,</i>

            then you two        
            would kick my ass.  

     So why don't we just...    
     save ourselves the headache

       and get it on right here?

       Besides, anything        
       you may do to my face    
       would be an improvement. 

       So let's let             
       the games begin, bitches.

 so I'm sitting

 and I look out                 
 the window,                    

and I see this Saab             
just swaying away               
like a ship at sea.             

Now tell me, what set           
that Saab a-rockin'?            

           You know,            
           a Yale man doesn't   
           discuss such matters.

    - Oh, we need details!      
    - Lurid details, Yalie.     

        I have details.         

 All right, for the first time  
  in my life, I have details!   

      She pins me against       
 the wall and sticks her tongue 
    halfway down my throat.     

  - I think I'm                 
    gonna gag, but I--          
  - Very brave of you, my son.  

      <i> And then without me</i>

           ( sighs )            
  she starts doing things I've  
only seen on the internet, man.

     But I gotta say, C.J.,     

   man, one of these days...    

    One of these days what?     

    One of these days you're    
  gonna get us into something   

       Scott's not gonna        
   be able to get us out of.    

      Never gonna happen.       

       Not in a million,        
         jillion years.         

        Because Scott--         

       Scotty-- Scott-tay       
         is "the man,"          

     the man with the plan.     

   Ain't that right, Scooter?   

      - Take it easy.           
      - Hey, I'm easy.          
        I'm just saying--       

     Well, maybe you don't      
       say so much, okay?       

    How come                    
    you keep lookin'?           

          There's this car      
          that's been behind us 
          the last couple miles.

    -<i> So what?</i>                  
    -<i> They keep creeping up,</i>    

and backing off, okay?          
It's weird.                     

      It's big, that car.       

I think this may be some        
of my fans from the bar, huh?   

 - Oh, great!                   
 - Just relax, okay?  We don't  
   know who they are yet.       

             Robby:

       <i> El Dorado, 1957.</i>        

            Oh, man!

        I love that car!        

        <i> I love that car</i>        
   <i> more than I love myself.</i>    

             The car's          
             a goddamn dinosaur.

   Yeah, a dinosaur that eats   
      Saabs for breakfast.      

          Oh, yeah, it's all    
          coming back to me now.

     - What?

Hey guys, I gotta               
take a leak.                    

     - Are you kidding?         
     - Dude, I never kid

         Why didn't you         
         go at the bar?         

     Because I was too busy     
   trying not to get killed!    

       Well, just hold it       
          for a while.          

     I wanna put some miles     
    between us and that bar,    
        so just hold it.        

       Dude, I have been        
    holding it for a while,     

           silently,            
        uncomplainingly.        

   - Mute, like a martyr?       
   - Dude, if you guys don't

         - Whiz.

  I guess so.                   

        So you're really        
         gonna do this?         

          Just get on

         - Tomorrow.            
         -<i> And do what?</i>         

        Just go up and down

   Sounds really bleak, man.    

        Nah, not bleak.

write my novel.                 

Okay, all right,                
or maybe I'll just              
get drunk every night           

  and pass out                  
  like my old man.              

            - Right.            
            - Yeah?             

       Yeah, yeah, yeah,

       He wasn't talking        
       about his future.        

     - He was talking           
       about his virginity.     
     - I was not!               

          Okay, I was.          

    My virginity haunts me.     

                 Bullshit.      

         You wear your virginity
         like a thorny crown.   

    See, that's one of those    
  things that you always say,   

       and it sounds like       
      it means something,       
        but it doesn't.         

        Robby, would you<i> please</i> 
        stop talking about      
        your virginity?         

         <i> You know what Granddad</i>
         <i> once said to me?</i>      

    He said, "People equate     
    silence with brilliance,    

   and stillness with depth."   

   Yeah, uh-huh.                

That reminds me                 
of what my grandfather          
used to say.                    

"Tell your Grandmother

       out of this heifer.

  ...and stillness with depth.

     <i> No we're not, Robby.</i>      

     As long as you don't break 
     into some sobby confession.

             And C.J., just keep
             your mouth shut.   

             We're not going

   so just relax, all right?    

           And you-- selling out
           your pals,           

              you little weasel.
              ( laughs )        

             C.J.:              
  <i> Yeah, you little dipstick.</i>   

             Yeah,              
     nice brother you are.      

            So what did you boys
            do tonight?  Did you
            go to the roadhouse?

         Hey, how'd you         
           know that?           

              Son, I too        
              was once underage.

              Did you get lucky?

              Of course you did.

          If you can't get lucky
          at the roadhouse      

          you might as well snip
          it off and mail it in.

       Well technically,        
          I got lucky.          

    - Yeah?                     
    -<i> Yeah.</i>  See, I was         
     <i> dancing with this one</i>     

      and she had a really      
   thick bra strap, you know,   

  - which indicates, you know,  
    pendulousness.              
  -<i> Mm.</i>                         

          And her bra,          
         it was black,          
         you know?  Oh!         

       And everyone knows       
     what that means, huh?      

       - Bonesville.            
       -<i> Exactly! </i> Yeah!        

     That's what I thought,     
      you know.  But, uh,       

 her breath, it wasn't perfect, 
   but I was willing to make    
          allowances.           

 I was just at the city limits  
   when C.J. got into a fight   

         and all roads          
        to Bonesville...        

     - ( blows raspberry )      
       blockaded.               
     - Mm.                      

    What was the fight over?    

          I have a lot          
     of unresolved issues.      

            Charlie:            
      <i> Did you fight too?</i>       

   - Only when I'm with C.J.    
   -<i> Yeah, I'm the fighter.</i>     

      - Scott's the lover.      
        ( snorts )              
      - Charlie:<i> Mm.</i>            

             Scott doesn't talk.

He's busy equating              
silence with brilliance.        

        - That's smart.         
        - C.J.:<i> Yeah.</i>           

                 What is that,  
                 Pez?           

           ( laughs )           
           I haven't seen       
           one of these since...

Well, it's either Pez           
or junk, Charlie.               

       - Yeah?                  
       - Yeah, your call.       

              ( chuckles )      
              What's that smell?

Smells like perfume.            

     Say...                     
     you boys...                

you ain't kinda, you know,      
"funny," are you?               

           ( laughs )           

   - Huh?                       
   -<i> ( C.J. lisping )</i>           
   <i>  You're hilarious, Chaz.</i>    

         - Shit.                
         - ( laughing )         

You've got something            
there on your                   

nice, clean                     
letter jacket, Scott.           

Looks like lipstick.            

         - Right there.         
         - Mm.                  

            Charlie:            
              <i> Mm.</i>              

¶ Lipstick                      
on your dipstick ¶              

¶ Told a tale on you. ¶         

          ( laughing )          

     - It's ketchup, okay?      
     - Uh-huh.                  

      Well, we can't have       
        the Yale jacket         
          besmirched.           

        That looms large        
         in his legend.         

          My brother--          
  All-Ivy League Quarterback,   
    two years running, Yale.    

          - Oh, great.          
          - Yeah.               

The guys from the Browns        
and Vikes are already           
scouting him and Reebok--       

Why don't we just pull          
over and form a small           
religion around the guy?        

Maybe make him a shrine         
of ice and call it              
a night, huh?                   

           Hey, look,           
      all I'm saying is...      

         it's more than         
     a letterman's jacket.      

          It's, uh...           

     - I don't know.            
       What would call it?      
     - Holy raiment.            

          Yeah, okay.           

      Look, all I'm saying      
     is my brother's never      
       lost at anything.        

           Anything.            

     We call it The Streak.     

        You want to take a right
        up here on Cedar, Scott.

       ( Cadillac engine        
           rumbles )            

       I think those guys       
           are back.            

              Who?              

    ( Cadillac engine revs )    

They sure are friendly.         

 Scott:                         
<i> What the hell's the deal</i>       
<i> with this clown?</i>               

  These guys friends            
  of yours?                     

        Charlie, are they acting
        like friends of ours?   

         C.J.:                  
        <i> You should've</i>          
        <i> slammed on your brakes,</i>

  - taught those                
    fuckers a lesson.           
  - That's nice language, son.  

          The language          
      comes with the face.      

    - Know what I'm saying?     
    - Sure do.                  

       This is what comes       
         from the hunt.         

       You must have some issues
       your own self, my friend.

            I don't have issues.

     - I don't sit              
       on things that long.     
     - How'd you get yours?     

       Me and my brother        
       were deer hunters,       

     but we don't use guns;     
         Bow and arrow,         

          in the name           
         of the sport.          

      Chuckles, how manly.      

       I hit this deer--        
    one shot, clean through     
           the heart.           

        I go to gut it,         

        but the buck has        
        life in him yet.        

           He swings his antler,
           and the damned point 

            cuts me right here  
            and just goes--     
            whack!              

          I knew what           
  the old buck was thinking--   

      "heart for a heart."      

         That's the way         
      of things, isn't it?      

   - Yours?                     
   - I got this Uncle Jimmy--   

         tripwire vet.          

          Crazy dude--          
          'Nam zombie.          

    <i> Takes me trout-fishing</i>     
         <i> by moonlight.</i>         

            He says             
     that's the best time.      

         What the hell          
           do I know?           

    So, dumb ass that I am,     
      standing too close,       

       Uncle Jimmy casts        
         and hooks me.          

    Freaked and pulled away     
      leaving half my face      
          on the line.          

      And that's the story      
     of me and Uncle Jimmy.     

    I call it "When You Wish    
         Upon a Scar."          

    The thing about a scar--    

       you shouldn't try        
          to hide it.           

       You know, wear it        
         like a badge.          

     That way, it takes on      
       a kind of beauty.        

       Chicks dig scars.        

         You find that          
     to be the case, C.J.?      

       - I'm gonna miss         
         you, Chuckster.        
       - ( laughs )             

     But I can't say when.      

         What the hell          
        are they doing?         

Charlie, maybe you should       
do something, being a cop       
and all?                        

       Oh man.  I'm off-duty    
       and way too tired to deal
       with jokers like this.   

<i> Just go around 'em.</i>            

             Scott:             
     <i> Well, so long, Caddy.</i>     

        Have a nice life.       

      ( engine rattling )       

           ( softly )           
             Shit.              

                 ( engine revs )

      - What do they want?      
      - What do you think       
        they want--             

       they want to drag.       
      You gonna give them       
        what they want?         

            ( snorts )          
            With you in the car?

            I think I'd like    
            to keep my license. 

  I told you,                   
  I'm off-duty.                 

  If it was me,                 
  I'd kick their asses.         

  -<i> ( Cadillac engine revs )</i>    
  - You do what you want.       

      Come on, go for it.       

            Oh shit.            

             Jeep.              
             Jeep!              

           Very nice.           

         Hey, you want          
       me to drive, huh?        

( tires screech )               

  - Why are we following them?  
  - I'm not following,          
    I'm losing.                 

           Holy shit!           
    They're killing my Saab!    

             Who are these guys?

       - Oh shit.               
       - Scott, back off.       

 - Scott, we gotta              
   get in that lane!            
 - C.J.:<i> He's right this time.</i>  

             Robby:             
            <i> Scott!</i>             

    - Jesus!  Oh God!           
    - ( truck horn blaring )    

( tires squeal )                

          ( screams )           

( whispers )                    
Holy shit.                      

       Now that                 
       was excellent!           

  <i> Whoo!</i>                        

Look at my goddamn              
car, man.                       

               Well, perhaps now
               is a good time   
               to re-evaluate   

          your over-the-top     
          attachment to material
          things.               

        ( laughs )              

        I gotta hand it         
         to you, Scott,         

     you're one mean mother     
       behind the wheel.        

    Look what those crackers    
         did to my car.         

I told you, Scott,              
you don't mess                  
with the Caddy.                 

      Sorry.                    

         Whoa.                  

   God.  I tried                
   to call my brother.          

      The lines are down.       
      That's a bad storm!       

           Don't they           
       give you some kind       
    of walkie-talkie thing?     

          ( chuckles )          
          Yeah, right.          

                We gotta get    
                to a phone.     

      - I'm gonna               
        call Mom and Dad.       
      - No, you're not.         

              Well, then you    
              call them.        

         I'm sure they'll listen
         to Mr. All-State.      

     Hey, Robby, Dad can't      
        know about this.        

         That's death.          
         You know that.         

             Yeah, I know.

          Hey Charlie,          

            you talk            
       like you know us.        

         You don't know         
           anything,            

   so enough of the backwoods   
       psychiatry, okay?        

       - It's just making       
         things worse.          
       - ( sighs )              

     You had to come all the way
     to Wisconsin to get laid?  

         They don't have girls

         Well, they do,         

      but they're all kind

            is this?            

    Well, it isn't fan mail.    

          Robby:<i> Sin?</i>           

           What sin?            

           Will find<i> who</i> out?   
           What the hell does   
           that mean?           

         It means Wisconsin is  
         getting too weird      

         and I really           
        <i> really want to go home.</i>

        I'm just looking        
   for a ride down the road,    

        and I'm off-duty        
      so I don't make any       
       judgments, but...        

         what the hell          
      you boys been up to?      

               This shit ain't  
               coming off, man. 

Did it just get darker?         

        ( engine revs )         

                Robby:          
               <i> Okay, let's deal</i>
               <i> with it, huh?</i>   

          <i> What's "it"?</i>         
          <i> Who did what, and who</i>
          <i> wrote that note?</i>     

  The guys in the Caddy.        

    -<i> It has to be.</i>             
    - Okay, so who did what?    

             C.J.?              

Well, I did sorta               
make this one chick             
leave it in her pants.          

       - What did you do?       
       -<i> Chuckles--</i>             

      I never<i> do</i> anything.      

        I just said some        
      stuff and this chick      
        got all geeked.         

         I mean, God--          
       Wisconsin chicks?        

         So sensitive.          

I tried to have sex             
with that girl back             
at the bar.                     

Jesus, maybe she has            
a big, mean boyfriend           
or something, huh?              

                  Jealousy--    
                  it's a killer.

   Oh God.                      

          Yeah, great.          
      I come to Wisconsin       
          to get laid.          

        I don't get laid        
     and now I'm gonna get      
         killed for it.         

  Just calm down, Robby.        
  It's nobody's boyfriend.      

  This is just random shit.     

  The note is just a mind-game, 
  so just relax, okay?          

  I told you I'm gonna          
  get you home.                 

             Okay.              

         ( mockingly )          
         Gosh, Scotty,          

        I wish you were         
      my big brother too.       

                 Where are we?  

  At the intersection,          
  take a left.                  

  A couple of miles             
  and I'm out.                  

        Anybody got any         
          breadcrumbs?          

       What is the deal?        

        ( engine revs )         

       Charlie, that road       
     they're leaving open?      

       <i> Does that get us</i>        
           <i> anywhere?</i>           

               Sure.            

      Deeper into nowhere.      

          <i> And Scott?</i>           
         <i> I'm off-duty</i>          

   <i> and I got a wife waiting.</i>   
           <i> Let's go.</i>           

    You guys get the feeling    
 they're leading us somewhere?  

     Scott, given our lack      
     of choice here,            

      I suggest we take         
      what we're given.         

          Charlie, you're a cop.

              What would you do?

   Listen to C.J.               
   Take that road               

   and get us                   
   the hell home.               

     - Charlie, let me          
       ask you a question.      
     - Shoot.                   

     Why would I want to go     
     where they want me to?     

            Yee-haw!            

             <i> Whoo!</i>             

Oh, that Caddy's history!       
Scott, you da man!              

             Yeah!              
    Those mothers are toast!    

  Did I not tell you?           
  Did I not?                    

  My brother, man,              
  he never loses.               

Whoo!                           
The Streak lives!               

          - Ha-- ahh!!          
          - Oh, Jesus!          

 Robby:                         
<i> G-go, Scott!</i>                   
<i> Go faster!</i>  God!               

    Oh, shit!                   
    Scott!                      

     -<i> ( glass shatters )</i>       
     - Scott:<i> Oh, come on!</i>      

   Why are they doing this?!    

   All right, now that we've    
    gotten our ya-ya's out,     

      pull over, I'm gonna      
      put a stop to this.       

       - Slow down, man.        
       - ( tires squeal )       

        Scott, back off!        

  <i> Slow down, Scott!</i>            

       Charlie:                 
      <i> Come on, now.</i>            

     - C.J.:<i> Scott, stop!</i>       
     - Charlie:<i> Look out!</i>       

          ( panting )           

           ( sighs )            
            Oh shit.            

             These fucking guys!

             Robby:             
  <i> They're trying to kill us.</i>   

        Oh Jesus, Scott,        
   they're trying to kill us.   

           I'm okay, by the way.

          Why is this           
        happening to us?        

           I don't know why     
           this is happening.   

              I just wanted     
              a ride home.      

       They want us dead, Scott.

        They don't want         
        us dead, Robby.         

         They want him.         

         Hey, Charlie.          

    How come you were so hot    
   for me to drag those guys    
       in the Caddy, huh?       

      <i> And why didn't you</i>       
       <i> flash your badge</i>        

     <i> when we were sitting</i>      
          <i> back there?</i>          

     You wanted to get away     
     from them, didn't you?     

      Jesus Christ, Scott.      
      What are you doing?       

        Look, before we         
       picked up Charlie,       

       nobody was trying        
    to run us off the road,     

     nobody was scratching      
          this spooky           

         biblical crap          
       on the windshield.       

     <i> After we pick him up</i>      

        there's nothing         
         but this shit.         

         They want you          
         for your sins.         

       Isn't that right,        
            Charlie?            

 C.J.:                          
<i> Yeah, the message</i>              
<i> on the windshield--</i>            

     I'm not one to judge,      
           Chuckster,           

       but what'd you do?       

       ( brief chuckle )        
     Hey, whatever it is...     

     you're not dragging us     
         down with you.         

              No.               

          You're going          
         back to Yale.          

           ( laughs )           

     That's right, Charlie.     

    And you're staying here.    

         Come on, guys,         
           let's go.            

         Have you lost          
           your mind?           

    We can't just leave him     
       here for the Caddy       
          or the cold.          

          He's a cop.           
     Jesus, Scott-- a cop!      

                 Here's a flash,
                 chief--        

                 he's a bad cop.

       and whatever bad-cop shit
       he did to those guys     

          is between their ass  
          and his, and not mine.

Look, I say                     
we give him a ride.             

It's just a couple              
more miles.                     

                    This is not 
                    a democracy.

      - He stays.               
      -<i> My young friends,</i>       

       this is something        
      you're going to have      
         to live with.          

       We all have nights       
     where we're revealed.      

         This is yours.         

             Okay.              

         If I wanted to,        
         I could draw my weapon 

        <i> and commandeer your car</i>
        <i> and be down the road</i>   
        <i> in a second</i>            

         and the law would be   
         on my side.            

      <i> ( Caddy rumbling )</i>       

   <i> ( engine growing louder )</i>   

                 Come on,       
                 get in the car!

             <i> Get in the goddamn</i>
             <i> car, Robby!</i>       

       - Come on, Robby.        
       - Go, go, go!            

         <i> ( gunshots )</i>          

    - Jesus!  They shot him!    
    - They killed him!          

    - Oh, shit.                 
    - Scott, we should          
      have let him back in!     

           I know!  We just have
           to keep going--      
           get home.            

        Dude, home isn't        
     gonna fix this, Scott,     
       what we just did!        

      Listen, guys.             
      What we did, we had to do.

              And now we're just
              gonna have to walk
              with it.          

     Dude, I am not walking     
       with it very well.       

    Look, it was him or us!     

       - I know.                
       - And now they got       
         who they wanted,       

        and we're done.         
  We're done with that Caddy.   

      It's over and we're       
     not gonna say another      
        word about this.        

       We're done talking       
      about it, all right?      
          I mean<i> done.</i>          

        Dude, it is not         
          done, Scott.          

   We gotta call the police.    
         He was a cop!          

   - Jesus, we let it happen!   
   - Scott:<i> Robby!</i>              

         Do you think those guys
         in the Caddy are gonna 
         go to the police? <i> No!</i> 

            The police are never
            gonna know anything 
            about us, all right?

            Now, I don't know   
            who that guy was,   

            or why those guys   
            in the Caddy wanted 
            him dead,           

          but I do know that    
          I'm going back to Yale

              and C.J.'s hopping
              a tanker tomorrow,

            I'm taking my       
            little brother home,

          and we're never gonna 
          say another word about
          any of this to anyone.

              I'll get you home,
              Robby.            

      Everyone in the car       
     that thinks the storm      
           did this,            

        raise your hand.        

        Where are they?         

     - Fuck.                    
     - We can't go back,        
       we can't go forward.     

  We could take that road       
  that happens to be right      
  in front of the tree.         

       They're leading us       
      deeper into nowhere.      

       I'd rather be led        
          than caught.          

         Scott, this is         
       awfully romantic.        

     I know what I'm doing.     

           We'll wait           
       the bastards out.        

Hey, kill the engine.           
He can see our exhaust.         

          Just keep going, baby.

                Just keep going.

I mean,                         
what do they want?              
They got Charlie.               

           Witnesses.           

       They gotta get rid       
       of the witnesses.        

      - I didn't ask            
        to be a witness.        
      - Nobody ever does.       

         Man, I wonder          
       what Charlie did.        

<i> Whatever it was,</i>               

<i> I hope it was</i>                  
<i> worth it.</i>                      

         Where the hell         
            are we?             

           ( sighs )            
         We're so lost.         

   There's a map in the glove   
       compartment there.       

          No, no, no.           
          Come on, come on.     
          They'll see the light.

            I got one of these  
            fluorescent tube    
            things in here.     

                 Give me that.  

   Okay, the thing with maps    
       is they only help        

      if you have kind of       
     an idea where you are.     

        We have no idea         
         where we are.          

  C.J.:                         
 <i> Okay, well...</i>                 

  we'll look at the map,        
  find that really              
  spooky tree                   

  we drove past                 
  like three times              

  and then go left              
  to the rusted tractor         

  and then go to right          
  to that shack where           

   - I'm pretty sure            
     someone<i> was</i> killed.        
   - Look, will you shut up?    

      I'm trying to get us      
          out of here.          

         Where the hell         
     is the Minnesota line?     

We're never getting             
out of here.                    

 Robby:                         
<i> I can't feel</i>                   
<i> my feet.</i>                       

    - I can't feel my hands.    
    - Jesus Christ.             

<i> But, really,</i>                   

      I really don't want       
          to die here.          

        I mean, I really        
       don't want to die,       
      but really not here.      

      Robby, will you keep      
     this shit to yourself?     

          I was hoping          

       maybe by the time        
          I graduated           

        -<i> there would</i>           
        <i> </i> be this girl.         
        - Oh man.               

<i> You know, I can</i>                
<i> almost see her face.</i>           

           This girl            
      who would love me...      

       without me having        
        to say anything.        

      And her laugh would       
       echo down the hall       
          after math.           

   I heard people               
   can have this thing          
   happen to them--             

   a moment that changes        
   their lives forever.         

<i> I always hoped</i>                 
<i> I'd have one of those,</i>         

          so I didn't           
         have to be...          

      - so me.                  
      - Nobody wants to be      
        who they are, man.      

         God, we all have       
         shit inside of us      
         that we wish we didn't.

                But we do.      

           And there's nothing  
           we can do about that,
           I mean--             

           I don't think we can 
           change that stuff.   

       So what's the best       
        we can hope for?        

                Forgiveness.    

       Well, that doesn't       
         come so easy.          

 Robby:                         
<i> You know what's weird?</i>         

      The last time we saw      
          that Caddy,           

      I think I saw a girl      
       in the back seat.        

    - Really?                   
    - But I couldn't            
      see her face so good.     

           It's "well," okay?   
           You couldn't see     
           her face so<i> well.</i>    

           God, I hate it       
           when people do that--
           good instead of well.

       It's like when           
       bad teachers ask you     
       "Is there any questions?"

          It's<i> "Are</i> there       
          any questions?"       
          I fucking hate that.  

    Look, I've been thinking    
       about that note--        

       on the windshield?       

         Then Charlie.          
    Why after they kill him,    

         are they still         
       trying to kill us?       

        C.J. was right.         
       It's because we're       
           witnesses.           

     <i> Yeah, I know,</i>             
     <i> but why haven't they</i>      
     <i> done it already?</i>          

           You know,            
        they could have,        

    back there when we were     
      sitting by the tree.      

      You know, they seem       
  to be leading us someplace.   

              Why?              
           To where?            

        <i> Maybe they keep</i>        
      <i> coming back because</i>      

          they killed           
         the wrong guy.         

           ( scoffs )           
          Robby, man,           
     you are eating brain.      

        And that note--         
          about sins?           

 Maybe it wasn't Charlie's sin  
        they were after.        

        <i> You know, maybe</i>        
     <i> it was meant for us.</i>      

           One of us.           

          Oh, that's right.     

          Yeah, blame C.J.      

          The ever-handy Judas. 

          I called two guys     
          in a bar "fat."       

             They kill you      
             for that?          

        I don't think so,       
        which brings us back    
        to you, Roberta.        

            - Me?               
            -<i> Yeah!</i>             

    Maybe while your friend     
    was smoking your bone       
    in the back room            

    her gap-toothed old man     
    was plotting your           
    castration.                 

        Then why hasn't         
      he done it already?       
      You know, I think--       

     I don't know, I think      
     it's something bigger      
           than that.           

     C.J.:                      
    <i> And Scott, my man,</i>         

    you're being<i> awfully</i>        
    quiet over there.           

    How were things             
    in the parking lot          
    with the sexless someone?   

   - Don't worry about it.      
   - Actually, I<i> am</i> starting    
     to worry.                  

          Don't shift           
      the heat on me, man.      

     When the shit tumbles,     
    it's you in the middle.     

      Oh, yeah, and you're      
          so innocent?          

      Mr. Skull-and-Bones?      

          C.J., you're really   
          starting to get on    
          my fucking nerves.    

     Oh, I know.                
     It must be so              

          draining...           

       stuck in this car,       
    sitting here all night,     

     staring at this face--     

      this same old<i> face!</i>       

                Fuck you, man!  
                God damn you.   

   - What the hell was that?    
   - Grace under pressure.      

     - Can I ask you            
       a personal question?     
     - No.                      

                   How'd you get
                   the scar?    

The squeaky voice               
in the back seat asked          
out of the blue.                

                I've heard all  
                of your stories.

   If I told you...             

  it'd just be one more.        

       <i> ( Scott screams )</i>       
      <i> God damn it! </i> Shit!      

          <i> Oh my God!</i>           

    Oh God,                     
    are you okay?               

     - Robby: Scott?            
     - Where are you, man?      

What the--                      

             What?              

          There's-- ( gasping ) 
          there's something dead
          under there.          

   It's Charlie.                

    - No, man, it can't be.     
      He's miles behind us.     
    - Is he?                    

We've been driving              
around lost for an hour.        

        ( all panting )         

            There's only one way
            to find out.        

I'm not a huge fan              
of finding out, by the way.     

        It's an animal.         
           ( laughs )           

          It's a cow.           

       It's a frozen cow!       

        It's a cowsicle.        

         How much do you think  
         that thing weighs?     

            Weighs?             

         A lot, why?            

      -<i> ( all grunting )</i>        
      - Scott:<i> And pull!</i>        

             <i> Pull!</i>             

          C.J.:                 
          Man, if you would've  
          told me this afternoon

           while I was watching 
           "Hitler's Henchmen"  

            that I'd be         
            doing this tonight, 

            I'd say, "Where'd   
            you get the 'shrooms

            and have you got    
            any more for me?"   

           - Come on.           
           - Okay.              

             Scott:             
     <i> Come on, guys, pull!</i>      

   - Robby: This is genius.     
   - C.J.: Yeah.                

           We bury old Bossy    
           here in a mogul,     

           then we lead those   
           Caddy sons of bitches
           right into her,      

           all one-ton-frozen-  
           dead-ass rock of her.

             and we are         
             as good as home.   

   You know, I've sorta been    
   going over my top 10 sins.   

Please don't feel               
compelled to share.             

     One time, I jerked off     
    in the boys' locker room    
     after swim practice--      

      - Oh, come on.            
      - when I caught           
        just a little shot      

     of Kim Ward's "beave."     

        I don't suppose         
     the guys in the Caddy      
  could have known that, huh?   

   No, but if they catch us,    

         I'm gonna sing         
         like a canary.         

        <i> ( C.J. coughs )</i>        

          I made love           
       with Miss Collier.       

     - The English teacher?     
     - Yeah, freshman year.     

            Details.            

She told me to stay after class 
      one night because...      

      I didn't understand       
       gerundive phrases.       

            So I do,            
        but all I can do        
         is watch her--         

       cross and uncross        
            her legs            

      <i> while she's sort of</i>      
    <i> explaining stuff to me.</i>    

       And the next thing       
     you know she's crying.     

            Crying?             

     Right there in school?     

     Yeah, about how lousy      
         her life was,          

          what a jerk           
        her husband is.         

 And the only way I can figure  
    to make her stop crying     
       is by kissing her.       

      Well, the next thing      
      you know, I'm laying      
    on her living room floor    

     staring at the ceiling     
 while she's doing everything.  

      And all I'm doing...      

           is falling           
       in love with her.        

      Oh come on, get out.      
    You would have told me.     

        I don't tell you        
       everything, Scott.       

           All right.           

       Let's go get 'em.        

         - Whoo-hoo!            
         - C.J.:<i> Yeah!</i>          

          - Yeah!               
          - Oh, yeah!

"Come and get us, you greasy

              Scott:            
             <i> Come on, Robby.</i>   
             <i> Let's go!</i>         

              <i> Get in the car!</i>  

         I told you, Robby.     
         I'm gonna get you home.

               Minnesota,       
               here we come.    

                      What?     

 I saw that girl                
 in the back.                   

   - There was no girl.         
   - Yeah, there was a girl.    

        She's down there        
          in the snow.          

    She was just going along    
      for the ride, I bet.      

         Now she's dead         
     with the rest of them.     

A girl, man, a girl.            
You talk about sin.             

         What sin?              
         She was riding         
         with those goons, okay?

   She's probably a stone killer
   just like the rest of them.  

          Jesus, Robby.         
          You think that        
          all girls are innocent

               just because     
               they're girls.   

Man, this night                 
is confusing.                   

        <i> Very confusing.</i>        

       -<i> ( sputtering )</i>         
       - ( dings )              

             Shit.              

 - We're overheating.           
 - It's like 20 million below-- 

  We're over-fucking-heating!   

          God damn it.          

                       ( sighs )
                       Oh God.  

         What the hell          
        are we gonna do?        

  Pack the radiator with snow.  

          ( chuckles )          
            Roberto?            

            You are             
       a goddamn marvel.        

   From the depths of despair   
         flies genius,          

        <i> hmm, a phoenix</i>         
        <i> from the ashes.</i>        

          ( sizzling )          

       Hey uh, you, lad,        

          have earned           
        shotgun status.         

               Now you are      
               a man, my son.   

                    Let's go.   

      <i> ( engine sputters,</i>       
            <i> roars )</i>            

        <i> ( sputtering )</i>         

           ( dings )            

     That's not                 
     supposed to happen...      

       is it?                   

          The back seat beckons.

     Look, just                 
     pull over, okay?           

  - Pull over.                  
  - I'm<i> sick</i> of pulling over.   

  - Dude, we gotta pull over.   
  - Look, it's my car.          

    I know what she can do.     
     I'm not pulling over.      
       We're going home.        

  - Enough of this              
    pulling-over crap.          
  - You can crack your block.   

   - I'm not pulling over!      
   - If you crack your block,   
     this Saab dies!            

  And so do we.  Is that where  
  you're going with this line   
     of thinking, Roberto?      

That exactly where I'm going. 
Pull over.                    

 - Stop telling me what to do.  
 - Who are you, The Car Czar?   

     - Yeah, you bet I am.      
     - Not anymore!             

    - Maybe you'd like to do    
      something about it?       
    - Maybe he would!           

   - Maybe he'd like to kick    
     your fucking ass!          
   - I would?                   

    - Why not?                  
    - I think you wanna         
      kick his fucking ass.     

      Yeah, why don't you       
     ask your brother<i> why</i>       
 I wanna kick his fucking ass?  

 - Okay, Scott, why does C.J.   
   wanna kick your fucking ass? 
 - How the fuck do I know?      

              Oh, you know!     
              You fuckin' know! 

           Oh, fuck!            

Oh, yeah!                       
( mimics )                      
"I know my car, man!            

   - I know what she can do."   
   - I'm so fucking sick        
     of you, man!               

 You and your fucking anger     
 and your loser old man         

  <i> and your fucking</i>             
  <i> broken-down old woman,</i>       

   and your nowhere             
   fucking future!              
   And fuck you!                

  Fuck you and your old man's   
  money and your fucking Saab,  

and your mom's martinis         
and your fucking "boola boola"  
future, and fuck you!           

        - Fuck you!             
        - Look, stop it!        

Come on,                        
knock it off!                   

          Cut it out!           
          Get off him!          

    - Get off him!              
    - Get off me, you punk!     

             C.J.:              
          <i> Oh my God!</i>           
         <i> Scott, stop!</i>          

           Hey, hey!            
         Fucking stop!          
           Stop that!           

        Fuck you, Scott!        

       Really, fuck you!        

      You were right, man.      

       Shit don't change.       

Scott:                          
What do you                     
want me to say?                 

      Sorry.                    

Come on, man,                   
I said I'm sorry.               

Will you say something?         

    - Say something.            
    - Just don't talk to me.    

          From now on,          
    you wanna say something,    
       you say it to C.J.       

           Hey!  Hey!           

          Whoo!  Whoo!          
             Whoa!              

         Whoo, come on,         
           guys, go!            

               C.J.:            
               Thank you, Robby.

        So I wanna know.        

How I got the scar.             

This isn't exactly the time-- 
Did I or didn't I make        
  it clear, Scott?              

        You don't exist!        
        Now how did you         
         get the scar?          

 How I got the scar?            

Well, there was                 
this Bengalese tiger            
that escaped from the zoo--     

         Shut up, man!          
       Tell me the truth!       

       We're not talking        
       about this, okay?        

    Oh, and who are you now,    
     The Conversation Czar?     

       <i> I should shut up</i>        
    <i> because you tell me to?</i>    

        I always do what        
     you tell me to, Scott.     

       "Robby, shut up."        

 "Robby, get in the back seat." 
     "Robby, just disappear     
       in the brilliance        

        of my All-State         
        big-brother-ness        
     and just stop being!"      

     Fuck!                      
     Now we're                  
    <i> really</i> fucked!             

        - What?                 
        - I'm outta Pez.        

         I need sugar.          

            Pronto.             
         Got any money?         

    It's in my jacket there.    

      <i> ( snow crunching )</i>       

         Oh, you suck.          

       <i> ( girl screams )</i>        

 Oh, shit.                      
 Come on, come on.              

   So it's C.J. they wanted--   
        the whole time!         

            Oh, C.J.            

          Go, come on.          

          ( dinging )           

             Shit.              

         ( sputtering )         

Dude, back off!                 
She's gonna blow.               

<i> Come on, it's gonna blow.</i>      
<i> Back off.</i>                      

     Ease up, Scott!            
     Come on, listen to me      
     this one time.             

           Back off.            

          God damn it!          

     Shit!  Come on, Scott!     
           Let's go!            

     <i> Let's go!</i>                 

    Come on, man!               
    Come on, Scott!             

                  Okay, come on.

   <i> Oh, Jesus.</i>                  

    ( gasps )                   

    <i> Oh my God.</i>                 

              C.J.              

               <i> They killed him.</i>
               <i> ( sobbing )</i>

<i> Jesus, Jesus.</i>                  

             Shit.              

          A deer, man.          

         They killed a deer.    

      Oh, Jesus.                

         What the hell          
      did they do to you?       

     Scott, Robby,              

      you guys gotta            
      get outta here.           

        Not without you.        

               ( echoing yell ) 
               Come on!         

              Come on!  Come on!

We're here!                     
What are you waiting for?       

    <i> Huh?</i>                       

           Let's go!            

            Oh shit.            

          ( grunting )          

       Did I not tell you       
     a night like this can      
     turn your head around?     

    <i> Turn your life around,</i>     

         change a man,          

      like one of you boys      
          changed me.           

   Meet my brother Luther.      

           Look what            
        you did to C.J.         

  - Don't you wanna know why?   
  - There is no fucking why,    
    Charlie,                    

and I wouldn't                
  give a shit if there was.     
You're getting awfully close. 

            Luther.             

         Tonight I went         
      looking for my wife.      

         And I find her         
        at the roadhouse        

   where I figure she's been    
  hooking up with another man.  

  <i> But it wasn't another man,</i>   
         <i> it was a boy.</i>         

           Jeannine!            

            Oh shit.            

      - Charlie, I have         
        something to say--      
      - No, you don't.          

          <i> So I find</i>            
          <i> my little queenie</i>    

         putting on her         
         pretty little panties  

         in the back of a Saab. 

              A burgundy Saab.  

   So before I kill somebody,   

       I gotta make sure.       

Which one of you                
in that car took my wife?       

Took my life from me?           

She didn't name names,          
bless her little heart.         

( chuckles )                    

That's why I got in your car,   
I wanted to watch you boys      
behind a wheel.                 

     And Robby,                 

when I smelled my wife          
on your brother's jacket...     

  well, game over.              

    Tonight could have been     
       a dream come true.       

     <i> If I had just gotten</i>      
<i> ol' Mr. Cream-Jeans here alone,</i>

   I thought I'd done it too,   
     but then zipper face,      

      he goes and puts on       
     the wrong damn jacket      
    at the wrong damn time.     

           So we had            
      to use him as bait.       

        <i> Do us a little</i>         
         <i> ice fishing.</i>          

       And lo and behold,       

  we caught ourselves a couple  
  of Minnesota dickless perch.  

          ( laughing )          
       Too small to keep,       

            you know            
        what I'm saying?        

           <i> You know</i>            
       <i> what I'm saying?</i>        

          Jesus, son.           

What the fuck                   
did I ever do to you?           

       You take my wife,        

           <i> you take</i>            
       <i> my life from me.</i>        

       <i> You took my life.</i>       

       Now I take yours.        

        Eye for an eye,         

           a heart for a heart. 

   Charlie, stop it!            

        -<i> Just stop it!</i>         
        - You shut up!          

Or what?  What are you          
gonna do to me that you         
ain't already done?             

 - Get back in the car.         
 -<i> What, what are you gonna do?</i> 

<i> Are you gonna kick</i>             
<i> the shit outta me again?</i>       

  Are you gonna kill me         
  after you kill him?           

   - Maybe.                     
   -<i> Well, aren't you tough?</i>    

            Get back            
      in the fucking car!       

              Run!              

Come on, C.J., Scott!           
Come on!                        

               Come on, C.J.,   
               are you okay?    

               <i> Are you okay?</i>   
               <i> Come on.</i>        

    I should have done this     
       on our honeymoon!        

             Come on, come on.

             Whoa!              

       Go!  Go!                 

    Go, guys!                   
    Go, come on!                

          - Hang on!            
          - Let's go!           

    - Scott: Run!               
    - Robby: Come on, guys!     
      We've gotta run!          

           Look out!            

 - C.J.: Oh, shit!  Go, go, go! 
 - Scott, where are you going?  

Oh my God!                      

    - Run, Scott!               
    -<i> They're gonna get him!</i>    

           C.J./Robby:          
          <i> Run, Scott!</i>          

             C.J.:              
          <i> Scotty, go!</i>          

    ( windshield shatters )     

                   Come on.     

           Oh, Jesus.           

            Hang on.            

       ( Scott screams )        

      Let's go.                 
      Are you okay?             

             C.J.:              
  <i> Come on, come on, come on.</i>   

  Robby:                        
  Come on, Scott, go!           
  Come on!                      

    Oh shit!                    

       <i> ( engine roars )</i>        

    Thus endeth the streak.     

      <i> ( engine revving )</i>       

           Shit, I can't--      
           I can't walk         
           on that leg.         

      Sit right here.           
      Here, I got you.          

                      Okay?     

       Shit.                    

      Easy.                     

   Oh God.                      

                 I gotta make   
                 a tourniquet.  

             Hang on,           
             I'll be right back.

             Scott.             

Put it underneath.              

  - C.J.:<i> Are you all right?</i>    
  - Yeah.                       

 <i> Careful.</i>                      

Okay.                           
Pull it tight.                  

          - Oh, fuck.           
          - Sorry.              

         - That's okay.         
         -<i> Okay.</i>                

           So we were           
        in eighth grade         

          <i> and just--</i>           

     just wrestling around.     

            I was...            

           losing...            

            to runty            
        Crockett James.         

        And I got so mad        

    I just started swinging.    

         I think it was         
   your mom's gardening hoe.    

             Scott:             
     <i> It happened so fast.</i>      

           I just...            
       swung at his face.       

    - The gash was all deep.    
    - C.J.:<i> Hospital deep.</i>      

         The blood just         
        kept on coming.         

     <i> I couldn't even see.</i>      

All over Dad's lawn             

  and his perfect               
  Japanese grass.               

I kinda liked that part.        

               Yeah, me too.    

  We told everybody             
  it was an accident.           

               C.J.:            
              <i> We were riding</i>   
              <i> our bikes.</i>       

But it wasn't an accident.      

          Oh no.  No, it wasn't.

    That's who I am, Robby.     

        No one's anyone         
         forever, man.          

         Come on, guys.         

         Let's go home.         

   <i> Jeannine.</i>                   

                Come on.        

             C.J.:              
      Oh, hello, Minnesota      

        and good night,         
           Wisconsin!
