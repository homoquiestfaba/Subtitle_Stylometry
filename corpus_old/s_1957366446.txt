How far did he get this time?

He made it all the way

He found his information.

He wants to go home.

[electricity buzzing

Dr. Fields, what the hell
is happening?

I tried to subdue him with ECT,

I was, but dumpling's been

[Madison groans]

What do you mean, "a hard time"?


She's just a little more

Do we have any Tylenol?

They say I can't take aspirin.

You know, if you've

I promise.

Hey, I was watching that.

Please, Derek, I really

No, maybe you need
to stop getting pregnant.

Derek, please. I just
really need to lie down.

You know the doctor said

this could happen again, right?

You know that.

How many times
do I have to watch

my children die inside of you?

Just stop.

You're breaking my heart,
Maddy. I swear to God.

You can't keep doing this.

[low ominous music playing]

Doing what?

Doing what, Madison?
Tell me what I'm doing, huh?

Tell me what I'm doing.

Are you saying this is my fault?

Are you saying this keeps
happening because of...

Don't touch her!

You bitch!
[Madison grunts]


Oh, shit.

Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

what happened here?

[Officer Lee]
Not that we've seen.

Where's the wife?
Already at the hospital.

We found her unconscious
in the nursery.

Uh-oh, here comes
Miss Lonely-heart.

Hey, Kekoa.
Winnie, how bad is it?

I've never seen anything
quite like it.

Maybe from a vehicular
accident, but not this.

This is something special.

Holy shit.

[Madison softly] Sydney?

Hi. Hi.

Where am I?
What... What happened?

It's okay.
You're in a hospital.

Where's Derek?

Do you remember what happened?
Someone broke into your house.

You were attacked, and Derek...


Just... Just rest.
I was...

[continues crying]
I was so scared.

Scared for my baby.


Where is she?

Where is she, Syd?
Where is she?

I'm so sorry, Maddy.
They couldn't save her.


No, no, no. No. No.


It's okay.

No! Please, no.


Hey, okay.

No!

[knock on door]


Mrs. Mitchell,
I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

I'm sorry to bother you,

but I need to ask you
a few questions.

Mrs. Mitchell?

with something?

Uh, I'm Detective Kekoa Shaw.

Oh, I'm Sydney Lake.
I'm Madison's sister.

So, can I help you?

Oh, this.

Um, I'm a...
a princess at Family Planet.

So, I'm on my lunch break,

and I thought I'd come by
and check on Maddy.

She's been like this
for two days.

I can't even get her to eat.

Well, maybe
you can help me then.

Did you know of anyone
who wanted

to hurt your sister
or her husband?

There's no sign
of forced entry at the house.

May have been
somebody they knew.

Somebody with access.

I wouldn't know.
Derek kept us apart.

This isn't her first, right?

The doctor said your sister

had three miscarriages
in the last two years.

Oh, my God.

Um, I didn't know.

I don't know why
she wouldn't have told me.


If there's anything,
just give me a call.

Yeah. Thank you.

you'll get a kick out of this.

No fingerprints, but all the
hand patterns are upside down.

Like our perp was hanging
from the ceiling.

That line up with anything
from forensics?

No footprints on the ceiling,
if that's what you mean.

But I spoke to the neighbors,
and more than one of them said

that Mr. Mitchell used to
knock Mrs. Mitchell around.

He beat her?

No forced entry,
an abusive husband.

Motive.

with you for a few days.

I can blow off work,
and a few auditions.

It's not like I'm booking
anything anyway.


It felt so real this time.

[sighs deeply]

I just...

I just couldn't do enough
to protect her.

You don't have to
stay here, you know.

but this is my home,

and I'm not gonna let it be
taken away from me too.

I'll be fine, I promise.

Oh, God.

You weren't answering.

I thought something was wrong,
I was worried.

[exhales heavily]

Thanks.

Oh, I, um, installed deadbolts.

[sighs in relief]
That makes so much sense.

Well, okay.

Mom made a casserole.

I could not climb with it,
so it is outside, but,

um...

You okay?

Derek did that.

He smashed my head
against the wall.

What?

I'm so sorry, Maddy.

Nobody deserves to die that way,

but seriously, fuck him.

You deserve so much better.

I thought about it a lot,
about leaving him.

By the time I got the courage,
I got pregnant.

Now, if only I'd been able
to have a baby.

Don't do that.
This is not your fault.

That's not what I'm saying.

I wanted to know
what it felt like

to have a blood connection
with someone.

A biological connection.

Maddy, what are
you talking about?


Mom and Dad took me in
when I was eight.

I don't remember
anything before that.

Mom told me that my biological
mother died during my birth.

Sydney, I'm adopted.

the Seattle Underground.

No, folks, this is not
a historical tour

of Nirvana or Pearl Jam.
[laughter]

This is a tour of old Seattle,

buried underneath here

like a time capsule
of a bygone era.

All this used to be
at street level

where the people worked
and lived.

But after the great fire
of 1889,

they decided to rebuild
the new city

on top of the old city.

One story higher
to stave off flooding.

You can still see
the cobblestone streets

and the storefronts down here.

And there are rumors of
passages stretching for miles.

Some say the ghosts of the past

still haunt these tunnels.

[police siren wailing]

Hey.

So, housekeeper found our vic.
Dr. Florence Weaver.

Tough old bird,
but she fought until the end.

What you got, Winnie?

He killed her
with one of her trophies.

We just got the base.
The top half is missing.

The brutality seems consistent
with our other corpse.

Same guy?
That would be my bet.

We need to find
that missing half.

[chuckles shyly]
Yeah, don't we all.

What you got?

Dr. Weaver specialized in
child reconstructive surgery.

She kept journals
on all her patients.

Bag all these books.

I want them back
at the precinct.

Yes, sir.

What, are you gonna
go through all of them?

We're gonna go through
all of them.

Hey, did you find the rest
of that murder weapon yet?

[Madison groaning and panting]

Did you know her?

No. No.

But I saw her die.

I don't know how.

I was doing laundry and...

and I saw him killing her.

It was him. It was him.

Him? Him, like the guy
that attacked you?

Yes.

He was here in the...

No, no.

I saw him murdering her
in her house.

And it was like I was there

It was... It was...
What is happening to me, Syd?



It'll be okay. We're gonna
figure it out, okay?


Ooh. [sighs]

That's it. I'm out.

I read about one more sick kid,

my brain's gonna
push out my eyeballs.

Good night.
Tell Marcus it's my fault.

I'll make up for date night.

He's pissed.

[Kekoa groans]

Jesus.

Yo, Basco, you here?
No.

[thunder rumbles]
I thought I was the only

good-looking guy here
working late.

Got this case. Strange one.
Can you age that up?

How old do you need?

30 years.

[thunder rumbling]

I know, I know.

But who would kill her, John?

Let alone mutilate her
like that?

I know, I haven't spoken
with her in years,

but the person I knew, all she
ever did was help people.

[man speaking indistinctly

Hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

He's here. He's here.
Who? Who?


There's no one here.

Look at me, there's no one here.

You were just dreaming.
Come here.

Shit, Maddy, you're bleeding.

I wasn't dreaming.

I saw him. I saw him.

He killed again,
but this time I saw his face.

I saw... I saw his face.

I'm seeing his murders,

like he's showing them to me.

What do you mean?
He's sending you videos?

No, goddamn it. I see them
as they're happening.

Like I'm having visions.
I know how that sounds.

Okay, maybe, when the killer
attacked Madison,

they formed,
like, some kind of, um,

like a... a psychic bond.

I mean, you guys
consult psychics for, like,

missing persons cases, right?

No, we don't.

I played a psychic
in an episode of a cop show,

and they said it's a real thing.

Are we really having
this conversation?

[Kekoa clears throat]

Okay, Madison,
what exactly did you see?

He killed again.

This time, across from
the Silvercup apartments

in North Beacon Hill.

I Googled it.
Great.

Wikipedia Brown here
just solved the case.

Listen, Madison saw
Dr. Weaver die as it happened,

and now she says she's seen
this one, so let's go look.

If she's wrong, you can
have her committed,

and you can put the cuffs on me.

[clears throat]

[upbeat suspenseful
music playing]

There it is. Silvercup.

I think it's this one.

Which one?

So what, are we gonna knock
on every door now?

It's the top floor.

We could help.

Yeah, we don't need your help.

Could you keep an eye
on these two?

Come on, Keh.

Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

What?

I see you.

What? They gave us a lead.

Cute little actress
throw you a ball,

and you gone chasing like a dog.

What was that?
Nothing.

Hello? Anybody home?
This is the police.

If anybody's here,
you need to let us know.

Keh. Keh!

[Kekoa sighs]

[sinister music playing]

So I'm putting out a BOLO

You okay? Okay.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

we're leaving. Thank you.
Um...

Okay. All right, well, I'm...

I'll see you around, okay?

Hey, hey, hey,
you finish aging that photo?

Yeah, I left it on your desk.
You saw it, right?

That's why you brought her in.

Brought who in?
The girl in the picture.

Yeesh.


She was the doctor's patient.

What? We've gotta turn around
and tell Kekoa.

We can trace the call.

The cops think I did it.

Well, this will
prove them wrong.

His name is Gabriel.

I don't know how I knew,

but talking to him, I just did.

He's someone from my past.

From before I could remember.

[Madison breathing heavily]

Where are we going?

Oh, Maddy.

Maddy.

I just had to see you.
Oh.

How are you holding up,
sweetie, hmm? Are you eating?

You look skinny.
I gotta cook more.

Mom, I need you to remember.

During the adoption,
did they say

if I had a brother or anything?

No.


The only thing they would say
is if there were siblings,

they try to place them
in the same family.

Then who the hell is Gabriel?

[ominous music playing]

[breathing shakily]

Mom, what do you know?

[Frank and Jeanne]
â™ª <i>Happy birthday... â™ª</i>

You wanted a party
so bad, Maddy,

you nagged us
until your father gave in.

We invited
your whole class but...

They thought I was a freak.

I had no friends.
I remember that.

â™ª <i>...birthday, dear Maddy... â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>Happy birthday to you â™ª</i>

<i>Blow it out, blow it out,
blow it out.</i>


[Frank and Jeanne cheering]


<i>Looks good.</i>

<i>Stop saying that.</i>

<i>They are.</i>

<i>Maddy, who are you talking to?</i>

<i>No one.</i>

<i>what did we say about lying?</i>

<i>I wasn't.</i>

<i>Well, then
who were you talking to?</i>

<i>Gabriel.</i>

<i>Is he your imaginary friend?</i>

<i>Gabriel isn't made up.</i>

<i>He says that you are.</i>

<i>He says you're not
my real family.</i>

<i>- This is the nightmare that...</i>
[Jeanne]<i> Okay.</i>

<i>Ooh, that's a kick.</i>

[laughs]
[Frank]<i> Ooh.</i>

<i>My little Christmas cutie
right here.</i>

<i>- Go get her ready for bed.</i>
[Frank]<i> Okay.</i>

<i>Maddy, playtime's over.</i>

<i>Santa won't come down the
chimney if you're still up.</i>

<i>Mommy said she'd love me
when the baby comes.</i>

<i>She said nothing would change.</i>

<i>I won't.</i>

<i>You can't make me.</i>

<i>Please don't hurt the baby.</i>


<i>Nothing, Daddy.</i>

Some of the conversations
you had with Gabriel

just chilled us to the bone.

Wait, so Gabriel was something
that I made up?

Whatever you went through
before you joined our family,

it hurt you in a way
that I can't even imagine.

I always figured
you created Gabriel

so that you could survive that.

We thought if we
gave you enough love,

you wouldn't need him anymore.

I hope we weren't wrong.

seeing things.

I don't know how,
but Gabriel wanted to...

[Madison sighs]

What did he want, Madison?

To hurt the baby.

It's as if he knew
that with you here...

I wouldn't need him anymore.

And he was right.

He became a lost memory,

buried deep in the back
of my head...

until now.

The killer said he was Gabriel.

My Gabriel.

Wait, are you saying
that the killer is

your imaginary friend?

[thunder rumbling]

[sirens wailing in distance]

[woman grunting]


[breathing heavily]


Whoa!

Fuck!

[dark dramatic music playing]


[sirens wailing]

[dark dramatic music continues]

gonna be okay.

Maddy? Maddy, listen.

Wait. Please.

Detective, wait. Please.

I don't know what's going on,

but Maddy couldn't
have done this.

You can't come back in here.
This is a crime scene now.

Please just listen to me.
No, you listen.

Back off,
or I'm gonna charge you

with being an accomplice.


Please.

Hey, you guys gotta see this.

[ominous music plays]

This is what he kills with.

It's the rest of
the missing trophy,

fashioned into a weapon.

I told you, from day one.

You got the murder weapon,
the coat, the gloves,

and Jeffrey Dahmer's workshop
in your attic.

It's over, Madison.

It was... It was Gabriel.

He got into my house.
He's done it before.

Enough with the bogeyman story.

Please, Kekoa. Please.

You've seen him.

You know that it's not me.

Who is the woman, Madison?
I don't know.

Gabriel must have snuck her
into my house.

tell you what I think.

You were sick in the head
when you were young.

Those doctors helped you.
It worked for a while.

But now your sickness is back

and you blame them
for fucking you up.

[lights buzzing]
[Madison] No. No.

It's not me.

Stop lying to us.

I'm telling the fucking truth!

[lights bursting]


[cell phone vibrating]

He wants to talk to you.

[phone continues vibrating]

You have got to be kidding me.

[static crackling]

This is Detective Shaw.

[electronic feedback shrills]


Who am I talking to?

<i>You found me.</i>

I didn't find you soon enough.

<i>But you found my things.
I want them back.</i>

Why was your stuff
in her attic, hmm?

You trying to incriminate her?

<i>Dumb bitch didn't even know
I was nesting in her home.</i>

Is all this personal?

<i>If my blade had punched a hole
in your face last night,</i>

<i>would that have been personal?</i>

Who are you, Gabriel?

<i>Oh, I thought she had
already told you.</i>

<i>I'm a figment
of her imagination.</i>

[Gabriel laughing maniacally]

<i>Ask her what
she used to call me.</i>

The Devil.

[static crackles,
line disconnects]

You see, Syd? That's why
we never throw anything out.

You never know when something
would come in handy.

Here.

[woman on phone]
<i>Yes, we had an Emily May.</i>

<i>She was remanded to our care</i>

<i>by the Simion Research Hospital.</i>

<i>It says here they've been
shuttered since the 90s.</i>

So it's just been
sitting there empty?

<i>Sorry, I don't know.
That was before my time.</i>

[line beeps]

[suspenseful music playing]

Whoa.

[suspenseful music continues]

[eerie music playing]

[muffled clattering]
[gasps]

[soft rattling]

[Sydney breathing heavily]

Basement Level.

Of course.

Please, Officer. Officer!
I'm not supposed to be here!

I haven't done anything wrong!

I am not supposed to be here,
God damn it!

They made a mistake.

[thud]
[gasps]

[woman chuckling]

[urinating]
Princess.

[indistinct chatter]

[woman laughing]

[sinister music playing]



"...the result
of an absorption in utero,

"growing in sync
with patient..."

[objects clattering]

<i>Today, we'll be speaking
to the subjects' mother,</i>

<i>Serena May.</i>

<i>15 years of age.</i>

<i>Poor girl was raped and
carried her pregnancy to term.</i>

<i>She's decided to entrust
her children to our care.</i>

<i>This could be
a phenomenal opportunity</i>

<i>to further our research.</i>

<i>Now, are you sure
you want to do this, Serena?</i>

<i>It's okay,
there's no judgment here.</i>

<i>Mama won't help me.</i>

<i>She called my pregnancy
a transgression against God.</i>

<i>I don't know how to look
after them on my own.</i>


<i>He's an abomination.</i>

<i>I don't know what else
to do, Doctor.</i>

<i>Please look after Emily.</i>

{\an6}[Dr. Weaver]<i> Don't worry.</i>
<i>You can have peace of mind</i>

<i>knowing we'll provide
the best medical care.</i>

They told me that she died
while giving birth.

Those lying cock-knockers.

[Dr. Weaver]<i> Now,</i>
<i>we're just going to need you</i>

<i>and your mother
to sign some paperwork.</i>

[EKG beeping]

When will she wake up?

She's in a coma, Detective.
It's in God's hands.

about the Underground.

Jane Doe was a tour guide
down there.

Employee of the Month.


This is Madison's birth mother.

[Dr. Weaver]
<i>Emily, are you okay?</i>

<i>Are you scared?</i>

<i>Well, don't be.
He won't wake up, I promise.</i>

<i>I've given him a heavy sedative.</i>

<i>It's probably why
you're feeling sleepy too.</i>

<i>We just wanted
a private moment with you</i>

<i>without Gabriel listening in.</i>

<i>We've noticed in recent weeks
you've become more aggressive.</i>

<i>Can you tell us why?</i>

[whimpers softly]

<i>He's been telling me
to do things.</i>

<i>Bad things.
To hurt people.</i>

[Dr. Weaver]<i> Is that why</i>
<i>you attacked Bobby Fey?</i>

<i>But Bobby's twice your size.</i>

<i>Gabriel makes me strong.</i>

<i>He told me to kill Bobby.</i>

[Dr. Weaver]<i> He actually</i>
<i>said those words?</i>

<i>Sometimes he speaks words...</i>

<i>and other times,
the words are in my head.</i>

<i>And then...</i>

<i>Then they aren't
really words anymore.</i>

<i>Just feelings.</i>

<i>But I knew what
he wanted me to do.</i>

<i>He pretends to be nice.</i>

<i>But he's the Devil.</i>

[Dr. Weaver]<i> Okay.</i>

<i>I'm going to wake him up.</i>

<i>Why don't you come around
after I've injected him?</i>

[Madison whimpers]
[liquid squirts]

[Madison gasps]

[screeching]
[ominous music playing]

[both gasp]
Oh, my God!

Oh, God!


[Dr. Weaver]
<i>So what exactly is Gabriel?</i>

<i>Gabriel is an extreme version
of a teratoma.</i>

<i>A tumor consisting of tissues,
hair, teeth, muscles, bones.</i>

<i>But more specifically,
in this case,</i>

<i>it's a parasitic twin.</i>

<i>When two embryos
develop in the womb</i>

<i>don't separate like they should,</i>

<i>one twin is dominant,</i>

<i>while the other
is underdeveloped.</i>

<i>It's not considered conjoined</i>

<i>because the underdeveloped twin</i>

<i>is dependent on the body
of the other.</i>

<i>Like a parasite,
Gabriel feeds off Emily.</i>

[woman 1] What's the matter,
Pollyanna?

You get lost on the way
to the country club?


Look, I don't want any trouble.

I don't give a fuck
what you want.

<i>An apple.</i>

<i>Pig.</i>

<i>A teddy bear.</i>

<i>We're starting to suspect
that Gabriel</i>

<i>can somehow access
the region to the brain</i>

<i>that process visual stimuli,</i>

<i>and make Emily see
what he wants her to see.</i>

<i>This would explain
her recent claims</i>

<i>of hallucinations
and waking dreams.</i>


[woman 1] What the fuck
did you do to get in here?

Forget to separate
the recycling?


But I'm willing to play nice
for a price.


What you got?

[Madison grunts] Guard!

No! No!

[woman 2] Bitch.

[both grunting]
[Madison groaning]

[woman 1 laughs]

[screeching]
[Madison screaming]

<i>Gabriel, stop it.</i>

[machine whirring]


[lights bursting]

[Madison grunting]

[squelching]
What the fuck?

[grunting convulsively]

[woman 2] Oh, shit.

Yo, this bitch
is having a seizure.

<i>Because they literally
share the same brain,</i>

<i>I think he's able
to trick her mind</i>

<i>and make her think she's
living her life as usual.</i>

<i>Essentially, placing her
in a mental prison.</i>

<i>When in reality,</i>

<i>Gabriel has hijacked her body
and is using it himself.</i>


[gasps and screams]

<i>It's time to cut out the cancer.</i>

<i>Gabriel's parasitic nature
has increased significantly</i>

<i>as he's now siphoning
more fluids and nutrients,</i>

<i>resulting in severe weight loss.</i>

<i>So Dr. Fields, Dr. Gregory,
and myself have concluded,</i>

<i>the only way to save Emily
is to excise the teratoma.</i>

<i>Now, Gabriel is conjoined
at the brain,</i>

<i>so full removal could kill Emily</i>

<i>or result in permanent
brain damage.</i>

<i>Course of action would be
to remove what we can</i>

<i>and suppress the rest
into her skull.</i>

<i>Let's close her up.</i>



[all screaming]

[growls]
[gasps]

[Madison screaming]


What the fuck?



[women whimpering]

Holy shit! Oh, God damn!

[bones cracking]

[bones snap]

[women continue whimpering]
[bones cracking]

[all screaming]


[all screaming]


[woman 3] Get me outta here!

Guard!
Get the motherfuckin' guard!

[neck snaps]
Guard!

[woman 4 screams]

Hey! Open
the motherfuckin' door!


No!


Holy shit! Hey!

[guard grunting]

[guard groaning]

[cell phone ringing]


Gabriel is inside of Madison.

He's been using her
this whole time.

He's been controlling her body
like a puppet.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sydney, slow down.

You're not making any sense.

<i>Madison's history.</i>

She was born
with a parasitic twin.

<i>Gabriel has been dormant
all of these years.</i>

When Derek smashed
Madison's head

against the wall,
it woke Gabriel up.

Bitch!
[grunts]

Jeez, Sydney, that's insane.

Madison's birth mother is
still alive, Keh. They lied.

I know. She's the woman

who fell out of Madison's attic.

We sent her to Seattle Medical.

Are you kidding me?
We have to talk to her.

She's the only person
left alive who knows anything.

[muffled clanging]

[muffled shouting]
[running footsteps]

[man muffled]
It's in the stairs, quick!

[muffled clang]
[man screaming]

[muffled thudding]

[gunshots]
[gasps]

It's coming from inside.
[Kekoa] Shit.

I gotta go. I gotta go.

Keh? Keh?

Fuck.

[tires screeching]
[car horn honking]

[ominous music playing]

[electricity buzzing]



[suspenseful music playing]


[lights buzzing]


[both gasp]





[indistinct shouting]

Shit! We're getting shot at!

Stay back.


We need backup.

Send the National fucking Guard!


Madison!

[rousing music playing]


[Gabriel growls]

[Kekoa groaning]

Get off him, motherfucker!




[Kekoa groaning]

[Regina groans]

Oh, my God.

Okay. Fuck.

Told you not to get
your ass kicked.

[both groaning]
[Regina] Okay.


[dramatic music playing]



[breathing shakily]

Regina.
[Kekoa coughs]

Oh, my God, Kekoa!

[keypad beeping]

Why am I calling the police?

Call paramedics. Now!

Oh, Reg...

[both groaning]

Oh, my God.

The mother, she's going for her.

The hospital. You gotta go.

I'll stay with her. It's okay.
Paramedics are on the way.

I'll be fine. Now go stop him.

Go!

[elevator bell dings]

this area is restricted.

Right, I know, Officer,

but if you could just call
Detective Kekoa Shaw,

then he can fill you in,

and just tell him
that Sydney Lake is here.

I'm sorry.
Nobody is allowed in here.

I cannot let you by unless
Detective Shaw is here with...

[electrical whining]

[stifled groan]

What's wrong? Are you okay?
[groans]

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Are you having a heart attack?

My pacemaker.
Okay.

It's burning.
[electrical buzzing]

[pained scream]

Please go get help.
Okay.

[pacemaker explodes]
[groans]

[Sydney screams]

[Sydney panting]



Sydney!

[electronic feedback whines]

<i>saving you for last.</i>


[electricity bursting]



[Sydney screaming]

<i>...over me.</i>

<i>Her own flesh and blood.</i>

<i>I should have killed you
before you were born!</i>


Gabriel, no!


Gabriel.


Please forgive me.

I should never have
given you away.

You were my son.

And I should have loved you
no matter what.


[grunts]
[Serena] Emily!

No! No! No!
You're hurting her!

[growls]
Sydney, get outta here!

[grunts]
[Sydney screams]


[breathes shakily]


Madison?
[Gabriel]<i> Shoot me!</i>

Madison, I know you're in there.


What did you do to my sister?

<i>She's not your sister!</i>

[screams and groans]

Sydney!


[snarls]
Maddy, please.


Maddy, I know you can hear me.
You have to fight him.


Madison, he killed your babies.

He was the cause
of your miscarriages.

He was feeding off
of your fetuses

to build himself back up.

Maddy, please, please come back.


[rousing music playing]

[bones crack]


Gabriel, no!

[gunshot]
[gasps, sobbing]


No, Gabriel. Please.

<i>...what you made me.</i>

I'm so sorry.

[muffled grunting]


[muffled groaning]

[beeping rate increasing]

[muffled whimpering]

[beeping rapidly]




<i>You were always a monster.</i>



<i>What's happening?</i>

<i>Madison...</i>


all the mind tricks you can.

[EKG beeping steadily]


Not possible!

Did you forget
we share the same brain?

I didn't ask
to be tethered to you.

You don't deserve your body.

I can use it better than you.

Not anymore.

You don't get to control me
ever again.

It's over, Gabriel.

I'm taking it all back.

My mind, my body, my everything.

Now, you get to live
in a world that I create.

[Gabriel grunts]

You can't lock me
in here forever.

You'll always be stuck with me.

Sooner or later I will get out.

I know, but next time
I'll be ready for you.

[gasps deeply]

[groans loudly]

[grunts, wheezes]


[wheezing]
[Gabriel wails]

[Madison groaning]


Maddy?

Maddy? Is that you?

Sydney, I'm so sorry.

I'm gonna lift this off you.

No, it's too heavy.

It was always my body.

If he was strong enough
to do this, then so am I.




[Sydney softly] Hey. Hey.

Hey, stay with me. Hey.

Hey, look at me. Hey.

[soft music playing]

[Sydney sniffling]


All my life, I've yearned

for a blood connection
with someone.

Yet in the end, it was right
in front of me all along.

Blood or not, you will
always be my sister.

And I will always love you.

[soft music continues]

[electrical buzzing]
