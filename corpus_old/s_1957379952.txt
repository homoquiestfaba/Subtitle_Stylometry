<i>[ Girls laughing]</i>

Okay, well.

It's been real ladies, but
grandma Palooza's upon us.

I find it always helps
to make flashcards or...

Both: Just teach a friend!


Could miss Byers be any more
out of touch?

She's like a million years old.

Ooh, maybe she'll retire
before finals.

Pipe dreams, sis.
Pipe dreams.


I'll catch you guys later.

Bye.
Bye.

â™ª <i>keep it groovin</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>keep it groovin, baby</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>you got to keep it groovin'</i> â™ª

Hey there.
Oh, my gosh!

Jeez, mom. Lurk much?

What are you doing?

Well, you know. I was
just sitting here waiting.

And, well, yeah, I guess
technically I was just lurking.

Now that you point it out.

So what's going on?

I was just hoping to catch you

because we need to talk
about something.

It's not bad, I promise.

Has anything good ever followed
the words "we have to talk?"

Well, if you're talking about

the dawn of time, history
of the human language

versus the continuum
of the dawn of history...

Okay.

Spill, mom.

I got a new job.

You did?

It's a young tech company.

Mm-hmm?

They offered me
head of marketing.

This is a big promotion.

That's amazing mom!
Oh, my gosh!

You work so hard.

You totally deserve this.

Congrats.

Why does it look like
you're about to tell me

that the fish in the tank
isn't actually Mr. Bubbles?

It's in Chicago.

Chicago, like move to Chicago?

No.

No way!

No!

I know it's a lot to take in.

What are you even talking about?

What about school?

What about my friends?

Our whole lives are here.

Hannah, you know how long
I've been looking.

So keep on looking!

If there were anything
out there, I would.

Baby, these opportunities
are one in a million.

And listen. I found
a nearby high school

that has a top-tier
magnet arts program.

It's supposed to be phenomenal
and like, really well-connected.

No.

And baby, all we have to do is
submit some of your drawings.

No.

You've been starved
for better art classes.

No.

Hannah, I know this is a lot
to take in, but big picture.

This could be amazing
for both of us.

[Breathing heavily]

Hannah...

Breathe.

You're having one of
your panic attacks.

No.

Look at me baby.

Hannah!

Look at me.
One, two, Hannah.

Stop!
Look at me.

Stop!

It's just not going to be
the same without you.

Aww.

Come here.

I'm going to miss you guys
so much.

No tears.

We're only a text away.

Plus, you should consider
yourself lucky.

Getting out of this lame
basic town.

And your new school
looks pretty tight.

Hopefully.

I mean Pratt is really hard
to get into.

So maybe Lakewood will
give me an edge or whatever.

A hundred p.

Or whatever.



Picture?

Okay.

Last looks.

Okay.

Here we go.

Okay.

Okay, let's see.


So snatch!

Are we even allowed
to be this glam?

Girl, we're not.

We almost forgot Iris.

You still have that thing?

Bite your tongue.

She'll hear you.

I think these are her ears.

You were so proud of it
when you brought it home.

Mrs. Sheen told me you spent all
afternoon painting the patterns,

trying to get all the little
details right.

And then I named it Iris.

And you didn't think
I was crazy?

A little.

In addition to being incredibly
creative and talented.

I do have to admit it.

She does look like an Iris.


Look Hannah...

I know how you hate
mom lectures.

But I just wanted to say

I know how hard this move
has been for you.

You're still mad at me,
I can tell.

But I know you're going
to like it here.

And we are going
to get through this.

You and me, just like always.

You're right.

I hate lectures.


Well, as a person who has
admittedly made

many not so perfect decisions,

I can confidently say
this is isn't one of them.

Okay, okay, okay.

Message received.

Hannah, I just...

What do you want me to say?

I know I have to take one
for the team here,

but it doesn't mean
I don't get to be sad

when something sucks.

Okay.

Right.

Here is your schedule
miss Brooks.

Your locker assignment is 10-24,

which is just around the corner
and down the second hallway.

Oh.

And principal Andrews
has organized

small group presentations today
in the south quad.

You're assigned to group three

so you'll need to be
out there by 9:15.

Thanks.

Okay.

Oh hey, do you know
where locker 10-24 is?

â™ª

Okay.

â™ª

Thank you for coming.

As you know, the second Monday
of every month

we have a preparedness week.

And today I'd like to talk
to you about this.

Does anyone know what
we're looking at here?

<i>Student: Jelly donut!</i>

[Students laughs]

This is no laughing matter.

This is what can happen
if you're behind the wheel

under the influence
of drugs and alcohol.

I have a question.

Are we going to be discussing
Riley Taft's heroin overdose?

Mr. Walker, we may have time
for questions at the end.

But right now
we're just going to...

So we're just going
to keep pretending

that it didn't happen.

Cool.

We have limited time guys.

So right now I'd like
to introduce our special guest

officer Mike.

[Weak applause]

Hey guys.

I know, you have a lot
on your minds.

But if you could just humor me
here and close your eyes.

Come on, close them.

<i>I want you to take a moment
to think about your future.</i>

<i>All the things you want.</i>

<i>Then imagine that in one
moment that all goes away.</i>

[Students chattering]

[Phone dings]

What, no filter?

Wow. To think that memorable
moment of yours

could've been lost forever.

Unsung, undocumented.

Just sending my friend a snap.

Yeah, I'm sure they're riveted.

Have I done something
to offend you?

Not you per se.

It's just the ego
fueled Chernobyl,

also known as social media.

Except no one ever dies
from Snapchat exposure.

Maybe a little on the inside.

Oh, okay.

All right students,
please take a seat.

Hope you all had a good break.

We have a new student
joining our program.

<i>This is Hannah Brooks.</i>

<i>She's an aspiring illustrator.</i>

Please make her feel welcome.

Now we have a lot of ground
to cover this semester,

both in and out of the studio.

Now we're going to be looking
at mixed media and printmaking

as well as focusing on
your individual portfolios.

But first I'm assigning
a partner project.

It's going to be due
in a couple of weeks.

Now the idea is to get out
of your comfort zone

and experiment.

Okay, starting at the head
of each table.

Look to your right and
you will find your partner.

<i>Take a moment to say hello.</i>

Please, try to contain
your excitement.

Yeah. I'll do my best.

Okay, so you're having
a bad day.

Why would you assume that?

I saw you at the presentation.

Talking about Rina?

Riley?

Riley Taft.

She was a student
at Lakewood high.

Overdosed a few years ago.

And she was a friend
of my sister's.

Their group of friends,
they all used together.

Heroin?

I hate to break the news
to you Dorothy.

But yeah it's a thing.

And it's still creeping
its way around campus.

School board paved over it.

No surprise.

Doesn't make them look good.

And that's more important than

oh, I don't know,
confronting reality.

I mean it seems like they were
trying to do something today.

Yeah.

I mean they did have officer
Mike show us a smashed car.

And do the "just say no"
routine.

Just like telling us
that abstinence

is the best form
of birth control.

It's a metaphorical equivalent
to putting a condom on a banana.

At least the banana's
not pregnant.

Right.

Hilarious.

Oh. One more thing to remember
in the coming months.

After midterm portfolio review

I'll be nominating one student

for the M. Snyder fellowship
at the art institute,

which is nationally recognized.

And for those of you thinking

about pursuing art
after graduation,

this is a special opportunity

and a big college
resume builder.

I am drowning in work emails.

Sorry.

No, it's fine.


There.

Whew!

So, tell me about
your new school.

You met anyone?

Not really.

It's the middle of
the school year

so everyone pretty much
has their friends already.

You know?

Oh.

It'll just take a minute I bet.

I guess.

So what about your art classes?

My teacher seems okay.

There's actually this fellowship

where he nominates one student
and it's sort of a big deal.

I looked it up and there's
some legit alumni artists.

Most of the students
get into top schools.

Way to Bury the lead.


That sounds all kinds
of amazing.

Yeah.

So what do you have
to do to apply?

I just have to get some
new sketches together,

which shouldn't be a problem

since my weekends
are looking pretty open.

[Clears throat pointedly]

Do you remember you have,

uh, plans for our Sunday
funday dinner?

With yours truly?

Duh.

Besides that.

Uh, full disclosure,

I may have also signed you up
for a summer sat course.

It's only six weeks, it won't
cramp too much of your style.

Can we talk about
something else?

This is really stressing me out.

Sorry.

That is the last thing
I want to do.

You're not having trouble
sleeping again?

No, no.

I'm fine mom.

Okay.

Oh shoot, it's already 7:00.

Um, I have to meet with
potential clients for drinks.

Yay?


Go rope 'em in.

I already have my lasso.

I shouldn't be too late.

Bye.

<i>â™ª</i>

â™ª

What are you guys doing?

Both: Our nails!

We got these totally
cool jewels.

See?

I love a good manicure
sleepover.

How are things in Chicago?

Good.

They're good.

You're a terrible liar.

I know.

Um, they're...

It's really not that bad.

It's just not home.

I know.

We're always here for you.

Thanks guys.


Bye.


Mwah.

Bye!


<i>â™ª We stay down for life â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>all I know</i>
<i>is we gon' get it</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>we gon' kill it</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>all we do is</i> â™ª

[Alarm wailing]

<i>Student: Come this way.</i>

[Alarm wailing]

Hey, it's a lockdown.

We just got to go
in the nearest room.

Come on, this way.

It's okay, hurry.

<i>[Alarm continues to wail]</i>

Okay.

Listen students, listen.
Please don't panic.

This is a lockdown.

I want everybody to get low,

stay away from the windows
and the interior walls.

<i>Down low, below
the line of fire.</i>

[Panicked breathing]

Is this your first lockdown?

Yeah.

Don't stress.

It's probably just a drill.

We have to do them
every quarter.

[Panicked breathing]

Never when I have a chem test,
mind you.

Nah, Mr. Campbell would
never let that happen.

Probably have us crouched down
right now with our scantrons

doing exams under the desk.

You're new here, right?
Are you a sophomore?

A junior.

Ah.

Senior chem is something
to look forward to.

Something to live for.

[Alarm stops]

<i>Pa: Thank you students.
This was a drill.</i>

<i>I repeat, this was a drill.</i>

<i>Please return to your
scheduled classes.</i>

So we live to see another day.

I guess so.

So I'm Dylan.

Hannah.

What uh, what school
did you come from?

I actually moved from Maryland.

Oh.

Do you know anyone here?

Not really.


Well, now you do.

Name and Insta.

Here.

Sweet.

Salty_sandwiches?

Yeah, um.

My friend Marcy has a dog
who's like a total food thief,

especially sandwiches.

So we named him lord sandwich.


And then I started posting
from his point of view.

I don't know it's kind of
a long story.

Okay.

I kept it going because,
I don't know.

I guess I'm just like, tired of
seeing everyone post

about their best lives ever
and all that stuff.

You know?

Yeah. I do actually, yeah.

You're a funny girl, Hannah.

It's nice to have someone around
who thinks so differently

for a change, you know?

Eh, I do what I can.

Okay, well my, my class
is that way,

so I'll see you around.

Yeah, bye.

Hey.

Uh, hey.

You free after school?

Uh...

There's the enthusiasm
I was hoping for.

Look, I'm right there with you,

but unfortunately
we need to come up

with a plan for our project.

It's due next week.

Yeah.

Or we can just blow it off
if you want.

No, no. We, we
should get started.

Good.

2568 Elmwood.

What's that, your house?

No, my studio.

You can walk there from here.

Oh.


Watch it, freak!

Hey.

[Fighting grunts]

Hey. Break it up!

I said get up!

Good talk.

My office.

Both of you.

2568 Elmwood.

<i>GPS: You have arrived at
your destination.</i>

<i>[Funky music]
â™ª</i>

Hello?

Rob?

â™ª

Rob?

â™ª

You're late.

Yeah. Well you didn't tell me

we were meeting in a weird
abandoned lot.

I thought we were meeting
at your studio.

That's what this is.

I do public art.

You can come up.

Your eye looks pretty bad.

Does, does that hurt?

A small price to pay against
the forces of bromophobia.

Ben Carlson is an idiot.

Not worth talking about.

What type of art is it
that you do exactly?

I'm working on a graphic novel.

Oh.

So you draw comics?

Graphic novels are more
than just comics.

Right. They're fancy comics.

Look, zombie and
superhero stories

aren't really my thing, so...

Well, they don't have to be,

because there's tons of graphic
novels that don't involve that.

Yeah?

Are we even allowed
to be here right now?

Uh, yes and no?

I have permission
to paint this wall.

The developer said
I could do it.

But he thinks Iâ€™m
a college student,

not a high school student.

So there's that.

I mean, why would you want
to paint something back here

when nobody can see it?

See that's your first mistake.

Don't assume no one can see it.

It's a wide open space.

Perfect to open a dialogue.

A dialogue.

Yeah, that's what real art
is supposed to do, right?

Inspire, start conversation.

As opposed to comics?

Okay then.

What conversation
are you starting here?

Those lines there, those
are the canvas borders.

It's like a large
thought bubble.

See I like to put worlds
or themes

inside of a closed thought.

Sort of my thing.

And then this figure here
pushed up against the top

trying to escape is inspired
by my sister.

Here.

Um, it's kind of hard to talk
about our project with these on.

Oh, is that right?

Tragic.

And I was really looking
forward to it.

Seriously?

Rob.

Rob! Hello?

Look, I have 15 minutes

until security shuts me
down, okay?

Let's just meet at the roof.

Man, that took forever
to get my order right.

It's cool.

I actually needed to brush up
on my waiting around skills,

so today has been super helpful.

[Phone ringing]


Hey, you okay?

Can I call you back
in like an hour?

I can blow this off
if you need me to.

You sure?

Okay.

Bye.

If you have something
better to do,

then by all means.

That was my sister.

She got out of rehab for the
fourth time a few months ago,

so it's important to pick up
the phone.

Oh, right.

Uh, so for our project we are
supposed to combine styles.

Excuse me?

What? I gotta see what
I'm dealing with here.

Uh, your character is...
Some sort of rodent?

That's Mavis.

She's a teenage honey badger.

She's sort of a loner
and doesn't look like much,

but she uses being
underestimated to her advantage.

World's most fearless creature.
You know?

Honey badgers?

Honey badger don't care.

King cobra?

Boom! Just a snack.

Beehive, no problem.

You know, she has
super thick skin,

so stings, bites,
Internet trolls,

everything just rolls
right off her.

So you're saying I shouldn't
mess with Mavis.

It's not advisable.

Got it.

So I take it you're applying
for the big fellowship.

Yeah. Aren't you?

I think I'm just going to take
some courses at the city college

when I graduate.

My grades outside of art class

aren't exactly going to wow
any admission boards,

fellowship or not.

That may not be true.

[Phone beeps]


Okay, so anyway, what
should we do for the project?

Well, I work large scale
and you work small, so...

Meet somewhere in the middle?

Say like a 4 x 5 canvas?

Okay yeah.

So let's sketch out some ideas
and meet back to hammer 'em out.

Sure. Whatever.

Mr. Arnet loves to assign
these partner projects

but they're always
such a waste of time.

Well, the key is having
a good attitude.

Right.

So it's dylan_collins45.


Thirst trap.

This is a real person?

I know.

And he's like, actually nice.

He has this sort of
earth-shattering dimple.

Oh.

He's definitely got
his angles down.

Is that a bad thing?

No, not necessarily.

He just looks a little...
Curated.

But I definitely would.

Oh, you're so bad.

Someone has to be.

Sorry babe, I gotta run.

Okay, no worries.

Bye.
Bye.

Hey there salty sandwiches.

Hey.

How's the PTSD?

I'm managing.

Hmm.

What's that?

Are you part of the art program?

Yeah. I mean technically.

That's really cool.

You know you don't have
to be shy about it.

You have a thing.

Not many people do, trust me.

Yeah. I, I guess so.

Do you want to come sit with us?

Yeah.

Yeah sure. Yeah.

Hannah, this is Blake and Rose.

Hi Hannah.

Hi there.

So where'd you guys meet?

Chess club?

You doing that again?

Uh...

Oh, a 4.0 isn't good enough.

He's forever puffing up
that college rezzie.

It's not going to puff itself.

Nah, Hannah's new to Lakewood.

We met in "the shit".

Lockdown drill.

Ah, classic.

Last quarter we had a drill
where there was actually

a dude in black roaming
the halls with a fake rifle.

Some parents were pretty miffed.

Yeah but some weren't.

Isn't that the real headline?

Yeah.

Crazy.

So where are you from?

Maryland.

Oh.

Must've been hard to move
to a new school

in the middle of the year.

Yeah, it's been different.

Brothers and sisters?

No. It's just me and my mom.

I'm an only child too.

Why don't you let the girl
eat her lunch, Rose?

So. What are you doing
after school?

No big plans.

You didn't invite her
to the Plaza?

I was going to.

Or you know, just ask if
you wanted to hang solo.

Lame. That's no fun.

We can all hang out together.

Yeah. Yeah.

That, that sounds cool.

Great. Then it's decided.

Okay, my turn.

This one's on me.

So dom and lobster.

Exactly.

Can I get you guys started
with some drinks?

Yeah um, could we get
some waters?

And I'll have a chardonnay.

I'll have to see some ID please.

Here you go.

What's your birthday?

December 2nd 1998.

Is there a problem?

I come here all the time.

Why don't you go ahead
and send over your manger?

French or Californian?

Whichever one is more...
Buttery.


You are unbelievable.

You tell 'em babe.

He was clearly ageist.

That was seriously ballsy.

Yeah.

Mmm.

Thank you.

I'll be back with some waters.

Thank you.

You don't even want it?

I just wanted to get away
with it.

You are so crazy.

That's why you love me.

Mm-hmm.

Speaking of love, which ones
do you like better?

These?

Ooh.

Cute, mm-hmm.
Those are them.

And then we've got these.

Ooh.

Okay, they both look
really good on you.

Perfect.

Then these are yours.

No, I can't let
you give me those.

Why?

They'd be a great shape
on your face.

And my mom doesn't even look at
the credit card bill.

It's nothing really.

Thanks, they're just,
they're not really me.

[Phone buzzes]


Sorry, it's my mom.

I have to go.

Seriously?

Well, I should hit
the books anyway.

Chem test tomorrow.

Hmm.

If he brings home an a minus,

parents might put him up
for adoption.

They might.


Good news bad news,

it doesn't matter if we keep
destroying the planet.

Hypocrisy, the beating heart of
every child-parent relationship.

Don't let these two depress you,
Hannah.

It's only depressing
because it's kind of true.


Hey, you coming to the thing
on Saturday?

What thing?

Since the world is ending,

someone had to throw
a party, right?

Yeah.

<i>[Rap music]

Are you having fun?

Beer pong and trap rap
isn't really my thing.

Whatever floats your boat
I guess.

Yeah, so why are you here then?

I was hoping to pick
another fight.

Hmm.

Should be easy for you.

My buddy Zev was supposed
to help me set up

some new scaffolding,
so I came to pick him up.

But he's three
jell-o shots down,

so I'd say that window
is probably closed now.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, are we still meeting for
our project tomorrow morning?

Kind of have to, right?

Yeah.

There you are.

Sorry, I need to borrow her

You're welcome.

I'm saving you.

Thanks.

I know of him.

Come on. Let's dance.

I'm not really a dancer.

Okay well, bathroom then.

Come on.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>[Muffled pop music]

So.

You and Dylan.

I think it's more
of a friend thing.

Do you like him?

Um...

I don't know.

Why so shy?

You don't have to be.
Not with me.

What's that?

Oh, it's just my meds.

Xanax.

I used to get kind of anxious,
like shy anxious.

But then I got the script,

it just helps quiet the noise,
you know?

Do you want one?

Um, is it safe?

Yeah. From my doctor.

It's not that serious.

Just helps me chill.

You should totally try it.

â™ª


â™ª

There you are.

I've been looking everywhere
for you.

Ah, here I am.


Oh, what's up miss Hannah?

Oh, you know, just living
the dream.

Hey someone has to.

May as well be us.

Cheers to that.

Totally.

Are you?

Yeah.

Yeah, I am now.

With you.

â™ª

â™ª <i>go on</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª <i>so go on</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª <i>go on</i> â™ª

[Phone ringing]

My god.

Hey...

Uh wow, what happened to you?

I went to this party last night.

And slept in your clothes?

I guess I was tired?

You don't know?


Were you wasted?


<i>Hannah, breakfast is ready.</i>

Sorry I have to go.

Was Mr. Abs there?

I need deets!

Okay. I'll call you
guys later.

â™ª

â™ª

<i>Mom: Yes, there's a lot</i>
<i>of crossover between</i>
<i>the two companies</i>

<i>I think we can use
to our advantage.</i>

<i>All right.</i>

Well let's meet
15 minutes before.

Thanks, bye.

I have been on the phone
all morning.

Everybody wants
to have a meeting,

then they want to talk
about the meeting.

Sounds riveting.

Sorry I wasn't here when you
got home last night.

Oh!

No, no big.

I'm sorry they're working you
so hard.

Ah, it's fine.

It's just a new job so I have
to say yes to everything.

What time is it?

It's almost 10.

I gotta go.

I have this art project
I need to get done today.

Oh, well remember
our Sunday dinner.

I am making caprese
salad and lasagna.

How about a sopranos theme?

Sure.

All right.

See you tonight.

Sorry, I'm late.

I imagine you were feeling it
this morning.

What's that supposed to mean?

You were hanging with
Dylan Collins and his crew.

Word is those guys
go pretty hard.

You mean they go to a party
and actually have fun?

Just passing along information.

Dylan is like a total
overachiever.

And nice.

You know, he's the only
actually nice person I've met

since I've been here.

Right.

So I stretched the canvas.

Did you bring some sketches?

Yeah.

I was thinking we could draw
my character Mavis

and in the background
we could have words

that describe her
but in your style.

I'm not mad at it.

Okay.

At first I thought your
character could have a thought

and I could paint the thought,

but it's also supposed
to be multimedia

so I found these cool frames.

What if we have your character
just like, holding it.

And inside the frame we have
her thinking the thought.

The thought inside the frame?

What is she thinking about?

Herself.

Like everyone else.

She could be taking a selfie.

So... inside the picture there's
a picture of her thinking

about taking a picture
of herself.

Maybe she's holding the frame up
in a way

where you can't see her face.

Really presenting it, yeah.

That's good.

Yeah.

â™ª <i>You're a chameleon</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>baby</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>and now I'm not</i>
<i>waiting anymore</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm so sick of this</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>hello goodbye</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>hello goodbye</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>hello goodbye</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>changing with you more</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>too many times</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>too many times</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>too many times</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>I'm so sick of this</i> â™ª

So if you hold the can here

and do really short bursts

you can really control
those small lines.

Okay, cool.

â™ª <i>Is your mind playing</i>
<i>tricks on you</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª <i>or my head's</i>
<i>too good for you</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>head's too good</i>
<i>for you</i> â™ª

So this, this is going to be
the harder part for me,

just because it's so small
I have to use a paint pen.

Mm-hmm.

So let me get the details first

and then you can do
the character, okay?

Okay, cool.

Cool.

[Phone beeps]

Okay.

â™ª

Um, how long is it going to take
for you to finish your part?

I don't know, like an hour?

Okay, then it has to dry.

Why don't we meet back up here
tomorrow morning before school

and I'll put the finishing
touches on Mavis?

We have to present this
tomorrow morning.

It won't take me very long.

Okay.

We have to meet early
so we have enough time.

7:00.

Cool.

See you then.

Hey.
Hey.

Thanks.

So you have fun last night?

I mean, it seemed like you did.

Yeah.

Yeah totally. Yeah.

Cool.

I was okay, right?

Yeah. You were tremendous.

There was a little bit of drama

when you were trying to open
your front door last night.

At my, at my house?

Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I dropped
you off last night, remember?

Right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Duh.

You know I've been waiting
all day to do that?


Come on. Let's get
out of here.

â™ª

Wow.

Come on, this way.

So, do you, do you have
a boyfriend back home?

No.

I mean, I dated someone for
a little while freshman year.

Mm.

What happened?

He started dating someone else.

A sophomore.

She was older or whatever
and I don't know.

I'm not the most
experienced dater.

I'm saying way too much.

No, you're not.

It... you know most people,
they're like,

they're always on.

You know?

But you're not on,
you're just, you're just you.

Thanks?

It, it's cool.

It's a way different vibe
from my ex, you know?

She's like 100 percent drama

and always needs to be
the center of attention.

Well, it sounds intense.

It was.

Yeah.

You know, I just, I just want
you to feel comfortable, right?

Like I mean we can totally
take things slow.

Well guys?

Oh, hey guys.

Oh, my god yes, finally.

Is this like your own apartment?

Isn't it so cute?

Hey, how are you feeling?

Good.

A little fuzzy.

You had some drinks
with your xanny.

The hot tub will fix you
right up.

Oh, I don't have a suit.

I think I left one here before.

I'll go look.

Thanks.

<i>[Rap music]
â™ª</i>

Does it fit?

Sort of.

Great.

<i>It looks really good on you.</i>

Thanks.

Cheers bro.


Did you want one?

Um, yeah.

Sure.

If you don't mind.

Yeah, of course.

This is heaven.


<i>[Rap music]</i>
<i>â™ª ...She's acting like</i>
<i>my old chick â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>nose in the air</i> â™ª


Aren't you worried your parents
are going to come home?

Oh no, they're out of town.

They leave you here by yourself?

No. My brother
still lives here.

He uh, he just finished
law school.

Got a job working for a judge

but it doesn't really pay much,
you know, so.

Oh. That sucks.

I know, right?

Like law school?
You can't even make rent?

How depressing is that?

Cheers to the future.

Cheers.

Cheers everyone.

It's already 7:00?

Yeah, I guess. Why?

It's Sunday night dinner.

My mom's like,
non-negotiable thing.

I'm going to be so late.

[Phone ringing]

Ugh.

We're still working
on our painting.

Yes, I know, I know.
I should've texted.

Yes.

Yeah. I'm ready for some
real Italian cooking.


Okay, okay.
I'll see you soon.

Okay. I'll drive you.

In case of emergency
break glass.

Yeah. Thanks.

Bye.

Later.

Peace.
Peace.

Well, she's alive.

But is she hungry?

You went all out.

I did.

There's the caprese salad.

And lasagna?
Not so great cold.

It's almost 8:00.

Sorry. We had to clean up
the art room.

And that took another hour?

I already feel really bad, okay?

You work late all the time.

Okay. Okay.

That's fair.

It's not that big of a deal.

I guess I just got
into character

playing the naggy
Italian mother.

Come on.

[Fakes Italian accent]
Let's eat.

<i>[Italian music]
â™ª</i>

Lasagna not doing it for you?

I made it with

[fakes Italian accent]
Ricotta and love.

Sorry, I'm not that hungry.

Maybe it's because
you're distracted.

Oh, come on, mom.

We unplug for Sunday dinner.

It's our thing.

It's more of your thing.

I seem to recall it was
a mutual decision.

We made that for when I was 13.

See? It stood the test of time.

I have homework to do.

Oh.

Okay.



<i>[Pop music playing]
â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>You wanna get</i>
<i>in my zone</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>well you can't be scared</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>you wanna be on</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>well I'm over here</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>come here,</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>let's talk about what</i>
<i>time will tell</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>let's see if we can fit</i>
<i>into a fairytale</i> â™ª

Oh, my gosh.

<i>â™ª</i>

And so our original design
had some ideas

that proved a little more time
consuming than anticipated.

Hannah.

So nice of you to join us.

Um, I'm so sorry.

My mom's car, it had
problems this morning.

Rob was just explaining why
the piece is not quite finished.

Right, yeah.

We were supposed to...

We didn't want to cut corners
on the concept,

so we decided not
to sacrifice quality

even though we were out of time.

I see.

Hannah, now that you're here

would you like to tell us
about the piece?

Um, yeah, so...

Um, we, we wanted to put
together our styles.

I'm um, I draw,
um and illustrate,

and Rob does murals,
and we wanted to,

uh, just join the worlds.

That was the assignment.

But what is this piece about?

Well...

It's open to interpretation,

and um, it's uh, you know,
if the idea is just to...

Look at it and um, to, to, uh...

It was to look at the idea
of self and self-image.

Who is the person we see
versus the person we present?

<i>[Muffled voice] See I was</i>
<i>skeptical about working</i>
<i>on canvas</i>

<i>because I'm used
to outdoor spaces</i>

<i>and I like the idea
of gearing things</i>

<i>towards a broader audience,
but...</i>

<i>I think we combined our styles</i>

<i>so that neither of us
felt compromised.</i>

<i>Mr. Arnet: And, were you
pleased with the result?</i>

Yeah. Definitely.

â™ª

[School bell rings]

Um, thanks for answering
most of the questions.

Yeah, it's not like
I had a choice.

I know.

I'm sorry.

Look, don't try and sell me
on that whole car thing.

I'm not buying it.

Honestly, I, I just overslept.

Wow. You're really committed
to your craft.

I am committed.

Sure you are.

Did I just blow my chance
at the fellowship?

Your precious fellowship
is based almost entirely

on the midterm portfolio review.

If you're serious about it
you might want to consider

making your work
your priority okay?

It is.

Sure.

Hello.

What's wrong?

I bombed my peer review.

It was my first one

so I really wanted to make
a good impression.

Aw, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

No. No, it was.

I was late and then
I totally froze.

Do you have a xanny I can have?

Yeah, totally.

Here.

There you go.

Thanks.

Yeah, no big deal.

Hello lovebirds.

Yo, hey.

Hey.

So the guys are busy today,
but do you want to hang?

Just the ladies?

Limited edition Jordan release.

They're calling my name.

Okay, yeah.

Cool, great.

I just have to get my stuff.

Meet me in the parking lot.

Okay.

Try to cheer up, all right?

Okay.

<i>[Rhythmic music]
â™ª</i>

â™ª

Is that you and Dylan?

Where was this?

It was in Aspen a couple
of years ago.

Our moms are close.

We've been vacationing together
since we were like, 10.

Oh.

Where is your mom?

At work?

They're in Europe
until next week.

So you're home alone?

Yeah.

Oh well, Ruth is here.

The housekeeper.

Wow.

I wish my mom would go somewhere

so I could just chill.

I mean I love her,

but she just, she stresses me
out sometimes.

She can be like, hyper focused.

It's just the two of us, so.

Well, at least she cares.

I mean, my mom doesn't
have a job,

but she's somehow always busy.

She's a functioning alcoholic,

although the functional part
is pretty debatable.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

My dad runs a pharmaceutical
company,

so he's basically a nihilist.

Kidding.

Kind of.

What about your dad?

Oh um, they divorced
when I was three.

He has a new wife
and a new family,

but I see him every
now and then.

But it's pretty perfunctory.

Perfunctory.

That's like the perfect word.

Describes my relationship
to the entire world.

Hmm.

Perfunctory.



What are you watching?

ASMR.

I find it really relaxing.

I don't like whispering though.
Just scratching and tapping.

I know, it's kind of weird.
Is it bothering you?

No.

No, it's sort of fascinating.

So you haven't had
a boyfriend since...

Freshman year.

But you've hooked up
with people?

Yeah.

Sometimes.

So... you're a V?

Technically, I guess.

I know.

It's sort of embarrassing.

No, it's not.

I thought that my first time
was going to be

this like, huge deal
and it was so not.

Shane was a big waste of time.

It is, isn't it?

I just get so spun
out sometimes.

It's hard to undo it.

The xanny seemed to help
with that actually.

You should get a script.

I mean, I don't mind sharing

but it's supposed to be
take as-needed.

And that's like every day.

Yeah. I don't think I can.

Why not?

Just tell your mom

you're having a hard time
adjusting to Lakewood.

Why suffer?

I mean the whole point
is just to get to normal.

And all you have to do
is talk to a doctor.

I encourage deep breathing,
mindfulness and meditation.

You know, that type of thing.

That's what I try to work on
with Hannah.

Right.

Absolutely.

I mean those things are great
tools and very effective.

But for some people
that just isn't enough,

and I think that's what
I'm hearing from you.

Yeah.

I think a prescription for Xanax
could be beneficial

for the level of anxiety
you've described.

This isn't for daily use.

It can be addictive
if it is misused,

so I ask that you
exercise caution.

Okay.

And you need to see me again
if you need more.

Oh, definitely.

â™ª <i>Ooh why, hey yeah</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>why you wanna fool me</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>simple as the fooling before</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>waiting for the moment</i> â™ª

â™ª

â™ª <i>ooh why</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>ooh why</i> â™ª

[School bell rings]

Hey Hannah.

Can I talk to you for a minute?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

What, what's up?

How's your portfolio going?

Good, yeah.

Really, really good.

I've just been staying up
really late working on it.

Okay. I'm glad to hear.

But you need to make sure you're
getting some rest as well.

Yeah, for sure.

I just, I just want to have
more of a storyline,

you know, laid out with images.

I've been mapping it out.

Well we're still a couple
weeks away.

If you want to get some
input before your review

I'm available.

As you know, I'm only able
to offer the fellowship

to one student.

Yeah, thanks.

I, I really appreciate that.

I will be ready.

Okay.

Um, miss Oâ€™Connor, do
you mind if I lie down?

I'm not feeling that great.

Oh sure, hon.

Yeah, just sign.

â™ª

Oh, hey you.

What's wrong?

I missed my afternoon art class.

I'm supposed to be prepping
for my big review.

I didn't feel good last night.

I hardly slept.

The xanny didn't even work.

And then this morning I couldn't
even keep my eyes open.

Huh.

Sounds like you're building
a tolerance.

You're going to need
to take more

if you want them
to keep working.

I'm almost out though.

Me too.

I've been getting them
from Blake

and he's been taking more.

Maybe your doctor
can up the dosage?

I just need to get back
to normal.

I just have so much work to do.

It's okay.

So Hannah.

I can up your dose
to half a milligram.

But I want you to be
very careful.

Xanax is a great tool
to help with anxiety,

but as I mentioned before
it also can be addictive.

Oh, Hannah is the most
responsible person I know.

I don't doubt that.

But it's not about
being responsible.

It's about being educated
on the risks.

Of course.

I understand.

I will be very careful.

Okay.

I'll go call it in now.

Everything okay?

Yeah.

Totally.

You don't need to worry
about me.

â™ª <i>Standing</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>waiting here to fall</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª and now I'm blinded â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>by my regrets</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª and now I'm blinded
by my regrets â™ª</i>

[Phone ringing]

â™ª

Um, the character is
not so much of a loner.

She's just different.

Um, like she's tough and,

and can do all these different
things like fight snakes.

Um...

But she's also vulnerable
and I wanted to show

what it's like to be
an outsider.

Like in your own life.

And that's something you,
you relate to?

Yeah.

I guess.

Okay. These recent sketches.

You're allowing yourself
to get a little sloppy.

I, I really wanted to finish
before the review

but I just ran out of time.

I tend to think it's better
to have one finished piece

done with conviction than
10 hasty ones, you know?

I just wanted to show you
how the story ends.

You know, for,
for the fellowship.

You know, the M. Snyder
fellowship

will be available
to you next year.

And I, I encourage you
to apply for it again.

I think you'd be
a good candidate.

But what about this year?

I mean, I can, I can work
on these some more

and I can bring them back
next week.

You have a lot of talent
and a unique point of view.

I just think you need
a little more time

to get everything you're trying
to express onto the page.

I'm sorry.

So, so it's a no?

It's a no, for right now.

<i>[Ominous music]
â™ª</i>

She doesn't take Xanax

but she's bound to have
some other decent stuff.

Jackpot.

Google please.

There's so many bottles.

Yeah, my mom's a hypochondriac

and a plastic surgery
enthusiast.

She never throws anything away.

Antibiotic, anti-fungal.

Malaria medicine.

Oh wait, this is a klonopin.

That's a benzo.

Same family as Xanax
according to this.

Perfect.

Oxycodone.

Hey pass me that.

That's not the same thing
at all.

It can help us chill, especially
if we're out of bennies.

Won't your mom notice?

I seriously doubt she even
knows what's in this drawer.

It's all good, Hannah.

Stop worrying.

Okay, let's go to my room.

Divide and conquer.

Here.

I don't know guys.

This still feels really random.

Are we sure this is safe?

If you have another idea Hannah,
by all means.

I'm just asking.

I know you're bummed you
didn't get the fellowship,

but I mean we're just trying
to come up with solutions here.

I know.

It says these k-pins
are just like xannies

only a bit stronger,

so maybe you can take half
and see how it feels.

I'm going to play some music.

â™ª

<i>â™ª day driving 90 â™ª</i>

No, no, no.

What?

I'm just trying to relax.

Maybe we should give them
some privacy.

Yeah.
Yeah.

â™ª

No, you guys don't have
to leave.

No, it's cool.
Come on Hannah.


â™ª <i>I can go back home ever</i> â™ª

Careful.


I'm a little wobbly.

Yeah, me too.

It's strong.

Yeah.

Maybe half next time.

Hmm.

Well, that's no fun.

Well, it'll still be fun.

Oh yeah?

Yeah.

Yeah, don't you worry.

Okay. Well then I won't.


Cause um, I like you.

Like, a lot, a lot,
Dylan Collins.

Wow. So formal.

I like you too Hannah Brooks.

<i>â™ª Flooding my head
flooding my head â™ª</i>

â™ª <i>...tell you how I felt too</i> â™ª

Hey you.

How you feeling?

I feel good.

Really good.

Yeah, I...

I wanted your first time
to be special

but I just got a little carried
away last night.

No, don't worry.

It was great.

And I was...

It was okay for you?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, much more than okay,
are you kidding?

Just making sure.

What time is it?

Time for round two?

I'm sorry, I actually
have to go.

I thought your mom knew
you were staying at Rose's.

Yeah, she did.

But she called like
a million times

and something must be up, so...

All right.

Um, I'll call you later?

Yeah.

Yeah, of course.

Do you need me to drive you?

No!

I mean, just not a good idea.

What if my mom saw you?

Yeah, I'll just, I'll uber.

Well, hang on, hang on.

If your mom's already mad,
then why do you have to go?

Hmm? Just stay.

I'm sorry.

I have to.

Yeah, I'll call you later.

Okay.

Do you want to tell me
where you've been?

At Rose's, like I said I'd be?

You failed to mention her
parents were out of town.

I spoke to the housekeeper.

You called to check up on me?

When you didn't respond
to my calls or texts,

yes, I was worried
something was wrong.

My phone died.

Uh-huh.

You don't believe me?

Seriously mom, you're being
over the top right now

and you're stressing me out.

The last thing I want to do
is stress you out.

But you're not
telling me everything.

This is not us.

Hannah, we talk about things.

I can't take this
kind of pressure.

What am I not telling you?

We hung out, we watched movies,
and we fell asleep.

It was a boring night.

Who else was there?

Blake and Dylan.

Happy?

Did they spend the night?

I have homework to do.

Hannah, come back here!

Why don't you ask me how I am?

Or how I'm feeling?

Instead of grilling me about
where I've been

and who I've been with?

Try talking to me
instead of at me.

I'm so tired of being talked at.

[Slams door]

â™ª

Hey.
Hey.

I, I saw you finished
your mural.

I really like it.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Came out all right.

How are things with you?

They're going.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Things are fine.

They're okay.

So everything's cool?

You missed class last week.

You kind of laying low?

I'm fine.

Just keeping things on the dl.

Yeah?

My sister likes to say that.

Well, I found out that I didn't
get the fellowship,

so there's that.

I've been pretty bummed.

I'm sorry.

Well, you don't seem
all that surprised.

Do you know who got it?

Um...

Oh.

It's you.

You got it?

Yeah.

I heard on Friday.

But you said you
weren't interested.

I wasn't, but Mr. Arnet
had a talk with me...

I mean, you didn't even want it!

I didn't, but I just sort of
changed my mind.

I don't know.

Well, well congrats.

That's great.

Good for you.

I gotta go.

Hannah.

Here.

Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

There he is.

Hey cy.

What you selling man?

Did you uh, get them?

Couldn't get any xannies,
but I've got this ativan.

They're lit.

I had a couple last night.

Well, how much?

I got 30 in there.

30 each.

$30 for one?

Cy, seriously?

Seller's market.

Hey it's fine, I got it.

Take this and that
should cover it.

Enjoy.

I didn't know they would be
that much.

I just wanted regular Xanax.

Look, I have some and you still
have those oxys right?

Yeah.

Trade?

Yeah.

Okay, get your bags out.

<i>â™ª</i>

â™ª

Okay. Let's go.

<i>[Choking]</i>

<i>Blake?</i>

<i>Rose: Oh, my god,
what's happening?</i>

<i>Dylan: What?</i>

Oh, my god, is he od'ing?

Oh shit, I think he's having

Call 911.

Will a seizure pass?

I don't know, but we need
to call 911 now.


Okay here.

<i>Operator: 911,
what's your emergency?</i>

Uh, hello?

Yeah, we need an ambulance.

Someone's having
a seizure, or...

I don't know, but he's

Yeah, 2041 Ashton court.

Hurry, please.

Yes, he's, he's breathing but
his body won't stop moving.

Okay. Okay.

Okay, give me your stash.

Huh?

Give me your stash.

Okay.

Okay. I have Blake's too.

I'll keep them.

You stay here and wait
for the ambulance.

We're going to go.
Okay?

What?

The more people that are here,

the more people there are to try
and keep a story straight, okay?

It's better for us
if we're ghosts.

Well we can't just leave!

No. Rose is right.

It needs to look like nothing
was happening.

You need to go.

I got this.

Go.

Come on, we gotta go.

Hey, hey, you're going
to be okay, huh?

You're going to be okay.

I can't believe we just left!

Look, there's nothing
we can do to help him

except get out of the way,
which we're doing.

How are you so calm?

Because that's how you get
through a crisis.

Look, when I was 12 my mom
had an accident.

Too many glasses of wine
or pills or both.

She fell down the stairs,

broke her nose
and a couple ribs.

Oh, my god.

She was a total mess.

I helped her stop the bleeding

and I made the gardener come
over and take us to the doctor.

She got stitched up
and sobered up

and we pretended like
it never happened.

That's seriously effed up, Rose!

Look, we're no good to anybody
if we're in trouble right now.

Just calm down and just think.

[Breathing heavily]

Don't take the oxy.

Maybe it's bad or something.

I gave him mine.

No, I don't think so.

I think that Blake had a seizure

because he stopped taking
the Xanax cold Turkey.

I heard that that can happen
when you just stop taking them.

It's why they have you taper off

if you change your dosage
or whatever.

Are you serious?

I don't know for sure!

But what happens
when we run out?

We just figure it out, okay?

And we ration what we have.
Oh, my gosh.

Figure out a plan!

Look, it's going to be okay.

We're going to figure it
out together, okay?

I guess we have to.

Hey. How was your day?

Good.

It was good.

I was hanging with Rose
and I came home

because I have a lot to do.

Did you have your portfolio
review?

I am dying to hear about it.

This week.

That's what I have to work on.

Better get to it.

Okay.

[Breathing heavily]

<i>â™ª</i>

Okay.

[Toilet flush]

Crap.

Did you see the cop
with the dog?

It's fine, don't worry.

It doesn't look fine!

Smile, okay.

You don't want to look
freaked out.

Is that a drug dog?

Is this about Blake?

No, it's not...

They're not looking for drugs.

Some freshman sent a snap of
his dad's gun case to somebody.

They figured out it was
just a prank

but they still sent some
extra security to campus.

Are you serious?

Someone was going to bring
a gun to school?

Maybe.

But they didn't.

You still have your stash?

No.

I freaked and dumped it.

Shit.

Have you heard anything
about Blake?

Yeah, he's okay.

Thank god.

His parents won't let him
talk to anyone

and then they took
his phone away.

Look, I gotta go.

Lunch?

Yeah.

Hey, get in.

I have some good news.

Cy knows this like,
for real dealer.

And he had the hookup.

Hmm.

Let's see.

Um, they, they look
a little off.

Like they're a different
color yellow.

Yeah, but at least it's xannies
and I feel like glass

is literally breaking inside
my head so I'm doing this.

What are you doing?

Snorting it.

It hits you way faster that way
and I cannot wait right now.

Here, can you hold that for me?

Mm-hmm. Yeah.


Is it okay?

Mm-hmm, yeah, it's good.

Okay.

Okay, okay. Get me.

Oh!
God, did anyone see you?


You can take this and keep

They'll be safe.

Thanks.

<i>Mr. Arnet: Miss Brooks?</i>

<i>Miss Brooks?</i>

<i>Hannah.</i>

Hannah, are you,
are you feeling okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, sorry Mr. Arnet.

I, I think I ate something bad
at lunch.

If you're not feeling
well enough to participate

you should go home.

Okay.

<i>Hannah: Thanks for
picking me up.</i>

<i>I'm sorry you had to leave work.</i>

It's so weird.

As soon as I ate the taco
I just felt off

and then it was like, pow.

And then I just started
feeling sick.

You can go back to work.

I'm fine.

I think the worst of it is over.

I'm not going back to work.

Okay, sorry again.

But, you know, you've had
food poisoning before.

I have.

But we know that's not
what's going on here.

The nurse said it's just...

I don't care what
the nurse said!

Hannah, you're high.

Oh, my god, I can't even believe
I didn't see this before.

What are you talking about?

Hannah.

I know you may be angry
and a little bit scared.

I'm not scared.

I'm fine.

You're being crazy!

Hannah.


You are the...

Hannah!

<i>Rose: Oh, my god, Hannah.</i>

Oh, Hannah.

Hannah wait.

No.

Hannah.

Hannah!

Hannah, wait!

Hannah!

Hannah!

Dammit!

Can't we just talk about this?

Hannah.

Hannah, what are you doing?

What does it look like?

Where did you go?

Please, just not now mom.

Not now?

What do you mean not now?

I just caught you sneaking
in the house.

Hannah, you need to talk to me.

I need you to give me
some space.

Oh, we are way past that.

with my boyfriend

and for a really screwed up
reason, okay?

Everything is completely
messed up,

so can you please
just cut me a break?

You're suffocating me and
I can't fricking breathe.

Hannah wait.

I can't.

No, stop!

No, please, just leave,
no, please, just leave!

Just leave!

Just leave.

[Inhales and exhales deeply]

â™ª

Mom, I'm sorry.

I, I shouldn't have yelled
at you last night.

I wasn't myself,
and I don't know.

I'm just, I'm really sad.

Hannah.

I love you.

I'm always on your side,
no matter what.

You know that.

I know.

And I want to help you.

But you have to be completely
honest with me.

I am being honest.

Honey.

I've made us an appointment
with doctor Weems.

What? I have school.

You can skip school today.

We'll, worry about that later.

But I don't need to see
doctor Weems.

You're just going to talk to her
about what's going on.

Get her opinion.

[Phone buzzes]

Okay.

Okay.

Hannah?

Hannah!

Go, go, drive!

Hannah, Hannah,
where are you going?

Hannah!

Hannah, please stop!

Okay. What...

What is going on?

I don't know.

What is going on, Dylan?

You tell me.

Are you even going to say
you're sorry?

Of course I'm sorry, all right?

But...

But what?

But what?

Rose and I have
a lot of history, okay?

You know she's my ex, so...

No!

No, no, you never told me that.

But you did tell me
that you loved me.

No, I said I loved being
with you.

My mistake.

What does it even matter?

There's way bigger stuff
going on.

You realize that.

Blake's parents are pulling him
from school.

He had a grand Mal
from benzo withdrawal

and his body literally
just shut down.

He could've died.

I just need to know that you're
not going to say anything, okay?

About what?

About what happened.

Rose and I, we're seniors,
so we can't afford to have...

Amazing!

That's why you came to see me?

Not, not, not to apologize
but to save your own ass

and to make sure I didn't
rat you out.

When girls get jealous
they can do some crazy stuff.


Right, crazy women.

It's all our fault right?

You're unbelievable.

Grow up, Hannah!

Did you really think
you're going to be the one?

Yeah.

Okay look.

I didn't, I didn't...

Hannah!

<i>â™ª It's not my place
to say if I did â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª you know I'd rather
be wasting it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª be wasting it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll never wait my turn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll never wait my turn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll never be enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll never wait my turn â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª you lied to me â™ª</i>

[Inhales deeply]

[Music distorts]

[Knocking at door]

Hannah?


Hannah open up.
It's Rob.

Hannah!

â™ª

Get the keys, where are
the keys to the bathroom?

Someone's in there.

Your spare key, where is it?

What are you doing?

Somebody call 911, please!

Hey Hannah, Hannah.

Hannah stay with me, come on.

Hannah!

Hannah, stay with me.

Hannah, stay with me.

Hey, hey, stay with me, please.

Stay with me, hey.

Woah.

Hey, hey.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Go.


Let it out, let it out,
let it out.

You're okay.

some water and towels?

Please!

Hey, hey.

It's okay.

It's okay.

You're okay.

Hey. You're okay.

You're okay.
I got you.

Look at me.

You're here, okay?

You're here, we're here.

You're okay.

We're going to get
you some help.

We're going to get
you some help.

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.


Oh, my gosh!

Baby, are you okay?

I'm so sorry.

Mm-mm.

It's okay.

I just feel so stupid.

I love you and we're going
to get through this together.

Okay.


How's the food?

Edible I hope?

Yeah, um, it's actually
not that bad.

I've been getting
my appetite back, so...

We are like, so,
so proud of you.

Aw.

Thanks guys.

I really appreciate it.

Um, guys I have to go.

Okay.

Mwah.

Big kiss.

Bye!

Mwah.

Bye.

Hey.

Hey.

I hope it's okay that
I'm stopping by.

Yeah. Of course.

I brought you some supplies.

Oh, you didn't need to do that.

Just munchies.

Some new pens and pencils.

And um, brought you this.


It's my comic.

Graphic novel.

I got your sketchbook
from your mom.

She let me scan in the images.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.

For everything.

Addiction is a disease.

You're a good person,
and talented.

Seriously.

Thanks.

They said that there
was fentanyl cut

into the pills I took,

and apparently it's like 100
times stronger than I thought.

I'm lucky to be alive.

Yeah, you are.

How did you know what to do?

My sister, after she relapsed,
I started carrying the narcan.

If you hadn't been there, I...

But I was.

Look, I'm not here to judge you.

Plus we're friends.

Yeah?

I know things are hard
right now.

But they will get better.

Believe me.

It's kind of weird hearing this
level of optimism from you.


I can be a little cynical
about the world, I know.

But not people.

People I still believe in.

[Phone rings]

Um, I have group
in five minutes.

All right, uh, I'll get out
of your hair then.

Um, I can come back on Friday,
if that's cool.

Yeah. Cool.

Okay.
