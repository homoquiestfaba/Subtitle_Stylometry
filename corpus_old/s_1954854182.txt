We were working with local
military anti-drug forces...

a search and destroy
mission on cocaine labs.

Lt. Dobbs and I had trained
local pilots in Cobras...

for their own
strike forces.

This is Snake Two...

entering sector 407 9.

Advise operations
of our position.

Wilco, Dobbs.
How's the view up front?

I'll be glad
when we get out of this canyon.

I was flying wing
with Captain Tejada.

Lt. Dobbs,
the other American...

was with
Captain Mendez.

Between the 2 Cobras was
a Black Hawk helicopter...

with a support team
of American...

and South American
D.E.A. agents.

It was our
<i>4</i>th mission as a team.

We were entering
a new sector.

It was rumored
among the locals...

that this was an area
of offensive cartel activity...

but we were
used to such rumors.

We were 5 miles
from the objective...

when we saw the Scorpion
attack helicopter.

Dobbs, bogey at your 1 2..00.!

Dobbs.!

Black Hawk,
get the hell out of there.

The Black Hawk
began evasive action...

but the Scorpion
was too fast...

heavily armed,
and hard to find.

The pilot was
the best I'd ever seen.

I tried to pull the Scorpion
away from the Black Hawk...

but to no use.

He was a cold killer.

Tejada!

Wake up,
goddamn it!

I took the controls...

and crossed over the top of the
Scorpion before he could fire.

I made it
out of the area.

 We said the cartel
was up to something.

I'm not blaming anybody.
We're on the same side.

We have some
decisions to make.

Thank you, Mr. Preston.
That will be all.

May I say
something?

Go ahead.

I volunteered to fly
with the anti-drug forces.

I watched the men
in those choppers...

risk their lives for their
families and their country.

The cartel has them outpaid,
outmanned, and outgunned.

Knowing that,
they still went out.

They didn't
stand a chance.

They're heroes,
and they should be avenged.

It's more
complicated than that.

I think it's
very simple.

They killed our people
and they killed our friends.

Their drugs kill
Americans every day.

It's a war, and it's
our duty to fight.

Thank you.
You are excused.

 Does anyone else
feel as frustrated as I do?


Yes, but it's a complex problem.

 We have an executive mandate
to stop the drug cartel.

That pilot out there has
the clearest take on this mess.

We are at war, and we deal
with the problem as such.

Should we go back to the
same sort of operation?

The D.E.A. is fighting
a war with its hands tied...

and we're losing.

Not anymore.

General Olcott,
I want a task force.

I want that operation taken out.
Yes, sir.

My Apache crews are
trained for ground support...

not for
air-to-air combat.

If this enemy helicopter
is as good as we hear...

I need help
to bring him down.

Anything
you want.

Who is this enemy pilot,
and what's his support like?

I've got to have
Brad Little and his team.

I want them
at Fort Mitchell.

This is a
need-to-know operation.

All reports
eyes-only to me.

And that Preston...

see if you can
keep him in the mix.

Will do.

Preston?

Yes, sir.

You've seen
this bogey work.

Can the Apache
stand up to it?

It is the only
aircraft that will.

How soon can you
fly the bird?

I'm scheduled to start hands-on
at Fort Mitchell.

Olcott wants you
in this mission.

I believe in you.

Can you handle it?
You can count on me.

At ease.
Take a seat.

We've got a lot to do,
so I'll make this brief.

This is our new
combat instructor pilot...

Chief Warrant Officer
Brad Little.

He'll bring us up to speed
on air combat maneuvers.

You men know
all about...

air-to-ground
technique.

Now you have a new
objective in your lives...

and that is to become masters
of air-to-air combat tactics.

When we have
mastered these tactics...

we will use them
to seek out...

the forces of evil,
and kill them deader than hell.

We're lucky men.

We face the opportunity
of a lifetime.

I do not expect you to
throw away this opportunity.

I expect you to improve
every minute of my time...

by becoming the best
air-to-air pilots in the world.

You will fight as teams
of Gunners and pilots...

each more dependent on the other
than to their own mama.

Our mission has
the highest national priority.

I can't stress
that enough.

We're going against
an enemy...

who's defending
his own territory.

The clock
is running, folks...

and it's
running fast.

Group!
Attention!

Carry on.

Looks like a fine
group of aviators.

They are that,
Brad.

Preston showed extraordinary
courage in South America.


Pay special attention to him.

Somebody called it
a flying race car with guns...

but that's
bullshit.

It's not
that simple.

Put your hands
here and there...

put your feet
here and here.

Do not step
here or there.

That's it.
Crawl right in there.

Riding at 1 50 knots
through the treetops...

is like having your ass strapped
to the nose of a bullet.

You will be flying
like a bat out of hell...

shooting at the enemy...

dodging bullets,
missiles, rocks...

spears, ducks,
and geese.

Sounds like
a full-time job.

You're gonna be as busy
as a 3-peckered goat.

Let's get to it.

[ Preston ]
You really get into this, don't you?

I love it to death.
I can tell.

Heaven,
here we come.

What do we do first?
Is this a quiz?

You whole
life's a quiz.

Tell me the first
order of business.

Program the nav systems,
enter the laser codes...

punch in target
and Doppler coordinates...

initialize weapon systems,
and optimize F.L.I.R. sensors.

Good. Let's see if the
damn thing will start.

[ Little ] It has a roll rate
of 1 50 degrees per second...

so if you need to duck,
dive, or disappear...

this buggy will do it before
your brain can think it up.

We could crash this aircraft
at 20 G's and survive...

but I am not
gonna prove it to you.

Darn.

[ Little ] The missiles
can take out a door at 5 miles.

In air-to-air combat,
your best weapon is agility...

and this gunship is agile,
mobile, and hostile.

Great.

[ Little ]
How's the ride?

[ Preston ]
Unreal!

God.

You usually hide in a hole
and cause things to blow up...

but now you'll
move like a thief...

keep your nose down...

then come out of nowhere
and blow your enemy to pieces.

Sound like fun?
Yeah.

Sir?
Yeah?

That was
totally cool.

I'd marry
that thing.

I'll give away
the bride. Buzzard!

MeetJake Preston,
part of the Apache force.

This is Scott Buzz,
my chief scout I.P....

and Billie Guthrie,
his copilot.

Billie Lee Guthrie.

I think I've
heard of you.

How you doin'?

I do fine.

How about a drink
this evening?

Jake,
not a chance.

''Not a chance.''

How much flight time did you log?
2.3.

What?
2.3, sir.

2.3.

You have a problem with women in the army?
Not with all of them.

Just that one.

I'll see you
at 07 00.

[ Daniels ] The cartel has made
the decision to go...

on the offensive and expand
into neighboring countries.

They've brought in Cuban
arms and an advisory team.

They've hired Eric Stoller,
a crack pilot and mercenary...

to ride shotgun
on their missions.

His terrorist training
was in Europe and North Korea.

Now he sells his expertise
to the highest bidder.

In this tape, our D.E.A. team
thought they had him cornered...

but it was a setup.

Stoller acted as a decoy
and drew them in.

There's a booby-trapped bomb
waiting for those men.

[ Daniels ] Watch for the box
at the bottom of the screen.

Everyone in Washington
knows what we're up against.

This guy's
a killer.

We need to support
the D.E.A....

and that means dealing
with Stoller air-to-air.

I'd like to be considered
for the Apache task force.

I need you here.

Nobody better
than I am.

It's your job to convey
that knowledge and experience...

to these young pilots.

When the time comes to use the experience,
I want to fly this mission.

Is Janet joining you?
This afternoon.

You want to fly and get shot at?
Affirmative.

We can't afford
to lose you.

-Just one drink.
No.

It's your birthday.
Let's have fun.

I'm 40 years old,
and I want to go home.

At ease, Little.

Everybody does what they
want on their birthday.

Surprise!

Oh, no!
No!

[ Humming ''Hail to the Chief' ]

There you go.

Go for it.

This is
really stupid.

Yeah!
All right!

How about
that drink now?

Interested?

Uh, no, thanks.

'For he's a jolly
good fellow '

No, Billie.

'For he's a jolly
good fellow '

' Which nobody
can deny ''

[ Little ]
Welcome to the future.

Descend the stairway
and turn right.

At the first platform,
enter the big black box.

Make ready
for war.

[ Preston ]
Want some gum, Breaker?

No, thanks.

Little, how about you?
Strawberry gum?

No.

It's delicious.

Come on,Jake.

This simulator will do
anything the Apache will do.

It will also do anything
your enemy will do.

Good, because I have
a pocket full of quarters.

Let's go play.

Set up X-ray.
Yes, sir.

[ Little ]
This program is called ''X-ray. ''

All babies need to crawl
before they walk.

All systems are up.
The pilot has the controls.

The name of the
game is surprise.

Stay low, using
the terrain for cover...

then nail
your targets.

There's a town.

Locate same
and recon for targets.

[ Preston ]
Let's see what this baby can do.

Looks like a quiet
Sunday afternoon.

That's a negative.

We dialed in <i>9</i>..00 A.M. Monday,
and we're open for business.

Mad turtle
on your 1 1 :00.

Missile laser
locked in.

Good shootin'.

You're talking
to a legend.

I hunt the pigeons...

you shoot 'em.

How are we doing?

You're looking good.
Proceed up the river bed.

Higgins, move it up
to Yankee program.

The schedule only
calls for X-ray.

I'm changing the schedule.
Yes, sir.

[ Little ]
Check out the highway...

for suspected
enemy ground threat.

I am the greatest.

Go,Jake.!

All right.
Free game.

I am the greatest.

He's good.

Yes, he's good.
He's very good.

I've played 'em before,
but nothing like this.

[ Little ] So much for the warm-up,
gentlemen.

You now have
air-to-air threat.

I am the greatest.

I am the greatest.

I am the
greatest.!

I am the
greatest.

I am the
greatest!

Crank this up
to zulu.

Zulu's for experts, sir.
Hold the exercise.

If you keep on making me
tell you things twice...

I'm gonna have you
washing windshields.

Back in bogey.

Watch the wires
or we're french fries.

On your deuce.

Coming up quick.

Nose coming up.

Smoke 'em.!

Shoot 'em,
nab 'em, grab 'em.!

Shake 'em, bake 'em,
cook 'em!

Broil 'em,
kick 'em!

Twist 'em.!

All gone!
Bye-bye!

Let's see how
well you do...

with your
monocles down.

See if we can pump all
that computer information...

into your little
bird brains.

A bit different.

[ Breaker ]
Let's get 'em.

Come on.
Working.

Come around.!

Jake,
what's wrong?

[ Preston ]
I can't focus.

Lock him!
Almost!

We got 'em.
Wax 'em.!

Watch those wires.

Now!

Goddamn it.

[ Breaker ]
It's okay,Jake.

Don't worry about it.
It's only a video game.

It's just a toy
the army built...

for your
personal amusement.

Try to make believe theyjust
notified your next ofkin.

Out of there.

I think...

we're pushing
them too hard.

I don't know about you,
Higgins, but I am.

[ Sharon ]
Clean the top of the rotor.

Sharon?

Hey.!

Do you know
where Billie is?

How do I know
she wants to see you?

You don't, but I'll
go give her the choice.

The laundromat.

That's just
Jim-dandy.

Breaker.

I'll see you
later,Jake.

What are you
doing here?

I owe you
a congratulations.

You got your wings.
A mere 2 years of my life.

A D-model
maintenance test pilot.

Told you I'd do it.
Yep.

So...

was it worth the price?
What price?

Us, remember?

Yeah,
I remember.

That's all
behind us now.

The main thing is that
we're here together.

You look sexy
in that skirt...

which is why I think we should
give it another chance.

I don't think so.
Why not?

I don't want to set myself
up for that again.

Can't we be friends?
Yeah.

We can just be best of friends.
Good.

What are
you doing?

It's a tradition for friends
to seal a bargain with a kiss.

The tradition
is a handshake.

You can't resist me.
I can try.

Aren't you
forgetting something?

You keep them.

Good morning.
Morning.

Morning, Chief Little.
Morning.

Yo, Chief!.
Morning.

Good pacing!

Beautiful day, sir!

[ Little ] Whoever sees
the other first is the winner.

Whoever gets seen first
is toast.

The land mass behind which
you can hide is your friend.

The open sky in which
you cannot hide is your enemy.

Just remember this:

once a battle has been engaged,
somebody is gonna die.

You do not have the speed
to run from a fight.

When you engage...

you must bring the nose of your
aircraft to bear on the bogey.

Unmasking, pop-ups,
pedal turns, hovers...

could all
be combined...

to effect your
nose-on position.

Put your weapons on the target.
The optimum attack position is?

Above and behind
on a 6:00.

The optimum kill shot is...?
Down through the rotor blades.

Some of you have been
paying attention.

I thought you were all
dreaming about women.

You're dismissed.

Stay out
of trouble.

''[''Chain Of Fools'']

' Chain, chain, chain '

' Chain, chain, chain '

Chain, chain, chain

' Chain of fools '

For 5 long years

I thought I was
your man

What kind of women
do you think come here?

I don't know.
Scandalous women.

The kind that you like, Breaker.
You, too,Jake...

because
there's Billie.

You treated me
oh so mean, baby

' You treated me
oh so cruel...''

Excuse me.
Back off, slick.

I want to dance
with the lady.

Get in line.

While the music's
playing, she's mine.

When it stops,
I'll let her go.

You wouldn't get between
a man and his fiancee.

Oh,Jake.

Take your
best shot.

Billie.

Hey.

Stay away,Jake.
I just wanted to dance with you.

I'm not a piece of steak
for you two to fight over.

Understand?

We don't go out
together anymore.

That's going
to change.

It's gonna
work now?

Too many things haven't changed.
Like what?

Like that Neanderthal
crap back there:

''Me man, you woman.''
I am notJane of the jungle.

I thought it was kind
of cavalier, myself.

I think you want me to stay home
and have babies and cook.

What's wrong with
babies and cooking?

It's a tradition.

My mother
did that.

Your mother didn't
fly helicopters.

Too many things
haven't changed.

She never flew helicopters.
What else hasn't changed?

We fight all the time.
We always make up.

Because I always
wanted to.

You still care
about me, don't you?

I want you
to stop this.

I'm going.

I have a flight test at 0500.
Don't you?

What if I do?
You think it changes anything?

Intelligence says the site will
be functional in a few days.

It has become the headquarters
for their operation.

It would support
an attack force...

even fighter
aircraft.

[ Olcott ]
We've accelerated our plan.

These were taken
a few days ago.

All the major players in
the cartel have disappeared.

We believe that they will
show up at this airstrip.

Your Apaches
should be ready.

Will do,
General.

[ Buzz ] The crew
and team assignments are..

Preston and Breaker
with Guthrie...

Davis and Proctor
go with me...

Rives and Tippet
with Wade.

Listen up, gun bunnies,
straight from the buzz man.

Just like Indian scouts
in the old days...

we're the modern day equivalent,
your eyes and your ears.

We stick
our necks out...

to see what's
out there.

Preston...

get your brains
out of your pants.

I can find
a target fast.

[ Preston ]
Let's talk about us.

[ Billie ] No,Jake.
To prevent radio detection...

we're set up
with A.T.H.S....

direct to your
video display.

[Jake ] I've got a display of your tail
that is mind-boggling.

Think of us scouts
as extensions of your own sight.

I like that.
You only have eyes for me.

You will need reconnaissance
going into battle.

With our laser
designator...

we can paint your target while
you're hidden in some canyon.

You can nail it from cover
without ever being seen.

In an emergency...

it's possible to distract
the adversary...

or temporarily blind him
with the laser.

Watch this.

Where are you?
You like me on top.

Jake,you still got your
brains in your cockpit?

[Jake ]
It's easier to fly that way...

loaded and
ready to fire.

[ Billie ] We've both been there
when those guns didn't go off.

Don't worry
about that, baby.

[Jake ]
How about that drink tonight?

You never let up.

-Jake, get hold of ourselves.
I've got a hold of myself.

[ Billie ] Then you don't need me.
Have fun with yourselves.

Billie?

Where'd she go?
Try to catch me.

That darn girl
disappeared.

She's got you.

[Jake ]
She sure does, Breaker.

I see you took
Preston up to zulu.

Had a hell
of a score.

Has a decision been reached
on my request to join them?

Brad, I'm sorry.

Combat's a
young man's game.

I'm the best
you've got.

It wasn't easy
for me, either.

Give it up.

Hi.
Hi, there.

Want to go a couple of rounds?
No, thanks.

Breaker,
do you box?

That kind of stuff
scares me.

I'm more into
cooking and cleaning.

''Cooking
and cleaning.''

You're dropping your
right with your jab...

leaving yourself wide open.
I don't think so.

Wide open.

You're talking to the former
light heavyweight champion...

of South Eastern Arizona
State University, 1 969...

intramural.

You're in a world
of trouble now.

Come on,
let's go.

Okay, a couple
of rounds.

Show me those
keenly-honed reflexes...

those catlike moves.

[Janet ]
Ready for some coffee?

Mm-hmm.

You slept in this morning.
Mm-hmm.

Honey,
what happened?

Nothing.
My back's a little sore.

What'd you do
to your eye?

I hit it.

With a
2-by-4?

No.

Boxing a little
down at the gym.

With Mike Tyson?

Ha, ha, ha.
How much time do I have?

1 0 minutes. Want some cereal?
No.

I'll get something later.

Here.

Are you sure
you're okay?

I'm fine, okay?
Just a little sore.

Maybe I pulled a muscle.
Are you sure?

You'd think I had
my dick shot off.

I'd better check,
don't you think?

You better see
for yourself.

Morning, sir.
Morning.

Everything cool?
Totally cool.

Good.

[ Little ] We have some snapshots
of a special individual.

His name is Eric Stoller.
Charming, isn't he?

Here he is on one
ofhis better days.

This man kills
people for money...

and someone has
paid him to kill you.

In air-to-air combat,
he has no equal.

His instrument
of choice...

is the Scorpion tactical
assault helicopter.

Don't let the size of
this aircraft fool you.

Because of its
speed and agility...

it is one of the most deadly things
you will ever see in the sky.

Put this personality
into this machine...

and if you blink up there,
you are in the body bag.

[ From TV] Law enforcement agencies
moved in unison today...

in a series of sweeping raids
of suspected crack houses.

Officers say that despite
the 2 4 arrests made today...

and the bust
made last week...

which netted over
$500,000 in cash and cocaine...

they are overwhelmed by
the massiveness of a problem...

that appears
to have no end.

Dobbs, bogey
at your 1 2..00.!

Dobbs.!

Well,
good morning.

Eat your Wheaties
this morning?

2 bowls, sir.

Good. All right.
Welcome to the bag.

Thank you.
You'll be flying in darkness...

dependent on your
sighting system.

Do your homework?
Yes, sir.

Good.

Lights out.

[Jake ]
It's very dark.

Nice and easy.

Try to keep
the airplane level...

and the velocity
vector centered.

You're
sliding left.

Don't second-guess
the equipment.

What you see
with your right eye...

should be coordinated
with the video screen.

Look right
7 0 degrees.

Where are you
taking us?

Don't turn us,
turn your head.

Maintain your heading.

You've got us close enough
to the rocks to count lizards.

I do not want to smack
that canyon wall.

[Jake ]
I can't focus.

I didn't know
we were turning.

[ Little ]
That wall is your line of sight.

Come to a heading of 2 <i>4</i>0.
Drop us down to 300 feet.

Come on.

Cross-check your
picture with your data.

Keep your
eye moving.

[ Little ] Where's the cocksure
sky jock I had last week?

You're yawing.

Trim it up.
I'm working on it.

Come to heading 200.

[ Little ]
See that big rock out there?

Do you see that
big rock out there?

Do you see that big
airplane-killing rock?

What the hell do you
want me to do with it?

I want you to approach
that rock on this heading...

until you are within
500 feet of it.

Cross left in front
of it on heading 1 70...

climbing out at 500 feet
to clear the canyon rim.

Clear?
Yeah.

Do it, Preston.

[ Little ]
Make your turn.

[Jake ]
I'm doing it.

[ Little ]
But it's ugly.

Watch
yourself!.

[Jake ]
I'm turning.

Closing on it.

I'm turning.

Take it up.!

I got it!

This flight is terminated.
I have the controls.

You're on
probation.

Let's go home.

I gotta take
my little girl fishing.

I had high hopes
for you, soldier.

It's like sex.

Hardly anybody gets it
perfect the first time.

The bag is
intimidating.

You heard?
The whole base heard.

I blew it.

Jake Preston,
super-pilot, blew it.

What happened?

I couldn't keep the data
in my right eye in focus.

My left eye took over
and screwed things up.

You ever shoot
a gun as a kid?

Yeah.

Shoot me.
Why?

What you're talking about
is not a flying problem.

It's eye dominance.

We all have one eye
that naturally takes over.

My dad always shot
the way you just did.

He was right-handed,
and left-eye dominant.

If I was left-eye
dominant --

You'd have a hard time accepting
data from your right eye.

You can learn.
Little can help you.

[ Engine Noises ]

Can we get this?
Mom said no more candy.

Get that bread with
the swirls on it.

Dad, what
can I get?

You can get spaghetti.
The colored kind?

Yes, and a big thing
of barbecue sauce.

I need to speak with you.
Speak.

I need your help to
get through the bag.

You've pushed me...

harder than you've
pushed anybody else.

You think I'm pushing you
because I want you out?

Maybe.

If I wanted you out,
you'd be gone.

I'm pushing you...

because I think you
could be one of the best.

Give her that
bottle, will you?

You fly conventional
helicopters beautifully.

Your instincts are so good, you
remind me of me 20 years ago.

But the Apache is not
a conventional helicopter...

and instinct
means diddley.

The most complicated equipment
on that aircraft is your brain.

There's nothing wrong...

with my brain.

My eyes are
screwing up.

I'm not gonna quit on this.
It's everything I worked for.

I need you
to help me out.

You get one more
shot at the bag.

Fail, you're out.
Pass, you're in.

We don't make any exceptions
in this outfit, ever.

You're not gonna
help me, are you?

That's real big
of you, Little.

You want to
tell me about it?

Nothing to tell.

You've been up
3 times tonight.

There's a kid
in the mission...

one of the pilots:
Jake Preston.

You mean old 2-by-4?
Give me a break.

The whole base knows about it.
So what?

He's just a
damn good pilot.

What's the problem?
He's got an eye dominance thing.

He failed the bag.

You beat it.
So can he.

If he doesn't, you wash him out.
You're tough.

They were
tough on you.

I know enough
about helicopters...

to make a lot of money
in civilian life.

You're a patriot, not a businessman.
That's right.

I'm trying like hell
to take the Apache air-to-air...

against some serious enemies of the U.S.A.
I know you are.

But it's going to guys who
are younger, maybe even better...

if I train them well
enough to replace me.

You've lost enough
sleep over this.

Let's go to bed.

Can I take my ice cream?
Yeah.

I don't care
if we aren't rich.

I care
about you.

What was that thing
that helped you?

Are you up to some kind
of silly joke, sir?

When I couldn't pass
the bag, it cured me.

If we wanted to make
you look like a jackass...

this would work
fine for that.

I always said you looked
good in red panties.

As long as you're
having fun, Breaker.

Let's go.!

Try to maintain
zero degrees of steering.

I do not want to destroy
any U.S. government property.

90 degrees of steering
to the hard right, now!

See how easy
that is?

It's all about control,
and control is in your mind.

Turn right.

Very good.

I would
avoid that tank.

[ Breaker] Wouldn't this be better
if we were all blindfolded?

Well done.

I lost just a little control,
but now everything's cool.

Right turn coming up,
<i>9</i>0 degrees.

Now.!

No.

In the ditch!

Yee-haw!

Better driving
than usual.

This will be a failure
if we all die.

Road's to the right.

I found the road.

Well done.

Easing off
on the throttle.

Smooth as
a baby's butt.

A couple more
training flights --

[ Woman ]
He's got panties on his head.

Morning, sir.
Get out of here.

Good day
for a drive.

Way to go.

[ Breaker ]
You're doing great,Jake.

All right, kid!

[ Little ] Mr. Preston,
today's your big day.

It's your final
shot at the bag.

Good luck, boy.

Listen,
sweetheart.

You know we're meant
to be together...

so how about getting
me through it this time?

[ Little ] I'm looking
for a smooth ride, Mr. Preston.

Smooth enough.

[ Little ]
Now show me the world, boy.

How am I doing, sir?

What do you think,
big boy?

Well, I'd have to say that
I'm doing piss-perfect.

How do you feel?

I don't feel...

anything.

Good.
Let's go.

[ Little ]
On behalf of the Army...

the Department of Defense,
theJoint Chiefs of Staff...

the V.F.W. and P.T.A.,
the commander in chief...

and above all, me...

congratulations,
Mr. Preston.

You have
passed the bag.

Good.
Okay.

You're the greatest.
Hey.

I passed the bag,
thanks to you.

Want to help me celebrate?
I'd love to.

Wow. You look amazing.

This old thing?

I threw it on as I was
walking out the door.

You still have her.
Yeah.

Some things should
never change.

I put your suitcase
in the trunk.

What are you doing?
Driving.

You knew that,
didn't you?

Okay, hot-rod.

Put the pedal to the metal
and let's see what you got.

[ Tires Screech ]

Whoa,
good night!

[Jake ]
Wouldn't it be terrific...

if we could get a house
here and live together?

[ Billie ]
There's nothing out here.

Then I'd have you all to myself.
Oh,Jake.

[Jake ] Why'd you change?
[ Billie ] Less to take off.

[Jake ]
Let's skip dinner.

God, it is
beautiful.

You're beautiful.

Ha, ha.

Patience.
Anticipation.

Food.

I learned
something today.

In the bag?
Yeah.

About dominance.

Put your right hand
out to the side.

Close your
left eye.

Put your left hand
out to that side...

and close
your right eye.

Jake.

[''Do You Remember?'']
' We never talked about it '

'But I hear
the blame is mine '

'And I'd call you up
to say I'm sorry '

'But I wouldn't want
to waste your time '

' 'Cause I love you '

'But I can't
take anymore '

' There's a look
I can't describe '

'In your eyes '

'If we could try
like we tried before '

' Would you keep on
tellin'me those lies '

' Tellin'me lies '

'Do you remember '

'Do you remember '

'Do you remember '

' Through all
of my life '

'In spite of
all the pain '

' You know how people
are funny sometimes '

' Theyjust can't wait
to get hurt again '

' Tell me,
do you remember ''

I hear there's
a great place...

a couple miles
up a dirt road...

where we can swim sans clothes.
I gotta get back.

No. Today is sangria day.

I can't.

I've got a F.L.I.R. flight
with Scott in 2 hours.

Just call the buzz man
and tell him you have plans.

You want to make
the mission, right?

If you had a choice between
a flight with Little...

or a picnic with me, what would you do?
Do I have to ask first?

If you ask me first, I'll
go anywhere you tell me.

You go alone.

Good thing
about the army.

I only take orders
from my superiors.

You drive a scout.
I drive the Apache.

Therefore,
I am your superior.

Get in and I'll
drive you home.

Come on,Jake.

I'm driving!

No!

Thank you.

I'm sorry about
the sangria.

Don't you ever
want me to win?

No.


Today you are entering...

the final phase of
aerial combat training.

You will engage
in air-to-air combat...

with your
flight instructors.

Your scores today will be
the determining factor...

for selection to
the Apache task force.

Good luck,
troopers.

Thanks for getting me
through the bag.

It's my job.
You've done very well.

I'm glad
to see it.

Just so you know...

I will be kicking
your ass today.

Good.
All right!

[ Little ] This is Rattler,
ready for a full day.

 Proceed with Stinger
to sector kilo.

This is Stinger.
Roger. Out.

[ Little ] Let's go to our corners
and come out fighting.

[ Breaker]
These guys are serious.

Breaker, you like history?
No.

You better start,
because we're about to make it.

Bring 'em on.

[ Little ]
Jump ball, kids.

Let's see who
comes down with it.

[ Breaker ]
Get me in position.

[Jake ] You want position?
You got position.

That kid's good.

I can't lock him.

[ Rice ] He's got position on us.

Not bad for
old-timers.

[ Rice ]
Old-timers, my ass.

Those guys
can fly.

Now, Breaker.

Let's get 'em.

Get me closer,Jake.

I got lock.
He's locking on us.

Not for long.

I can't lock him.

[ Little ]
Look alive, Rice.

[ Little ]
Good-bye, try again.

Hang on, rice man.

Let's see if they
can keep up with this.

Where'd
they go?

Where?
I don't know.

[Jake ]
Clever, Chief.

Let's do it.

[ Little ]
Get ready, Rice.

We're gonna
park it here.

I've lost him,Jake.

He's vertical,
over the top.

Let's get 'em.
He'll pop through that notch.

[Jake ]
He's hiding in a hole.

I'll give him
vertical with a twist.

[Jake ]
Look who we found.

''Hasta la bye-bye.''

Nose down,
Breaker.

Lock.
Now!

[ Breaker ]
Missiles's gone.

Shit!

He's toast.
Great flying.

Rattler, they just
notified your next of kin.

I got your next ofkin.

Well done, boys.

Let's get supper.

[ Little ]
Good flying, Preston.

Intelligence reports the cartel
offensive is set to launch.

All the major players are there,
but we don't know for how long.

We can't let them slip
through our fingers.

How much time do we have?
We must move immediately.

We have less than 2 <i>4</i> hours
to eliminate this threat.
Any word on Stoller?

He's there, making sure
we don't get near them.

Morning, troopers.
Let's do it.

Task force,
attention!

At ease.
Listen up.

In 2 4 hours, you'll be asked
to use what you've learned here.

Our mission is
to fly support...

for a D.E.A. operation
of critical importance..

Operation Fire Bird.
We launch immediately.

We move out
tomorrow morning....

for a staging area
in South America.

Once we're
on the ground...

you'll get your
operations order.

What I can
tell you now...

is that we will
be going air-to-air...

against a Scorpion attack
helicopter and its backup.

There'll be officials
on hand down there...

to arrest
cartel leaders.

Our job is
to make damn sure...

they get
that chance.

That's all.
Let's get hot.

Congratulations.
Thank you, Colonel.

Good luck.
Right,Jake.

Brad, I've reviewed
the gun-camera tapes...

from your
training flights.

Every man has got his
place of maximum effect.

Brad Little's is
with this task force...

flying the mission.
You're my flight leader.

I knew that.

I want to
talk to you.

We can talk on the flight down.
What do you mean?

On the flight
to South America.

How the hell
did that happen?

I asked and
A.K. cleared it.

You're going
into combat?

I don't believe
I'm hearing this.

You think it's fine
for me to be a pilot...

when there's
nothing at stake...

but dangerous missions
are only for men.

Thanks,Jake.
I have my orders.

Why is it so hard
for you to understand...

that I just don't
want you to get hurt?

You, my friend,
have to accept it.

''My friend''?

[ Daniels ] The Bisante cartel
has been amassing heavy arms...

for an attack on
a friendly government.

Every operation
that the D.E.A...

and our South American allies
have mounted has been blown away...

by Eric Stoller.
They're airlifting...

some major figures in the
cartel under Stoller's cover.

The local government is tired of
having their army chewed up...

by this guy.

They've asked
for your help.

They're counting
on you.

On your feet.
Get some sleep.

Sleep well?
Hell, no.

What do
you think?

It all depends on things
we don't know right now.

You train and you
know you're capable...

but when it comes time,
you wonder what you'll do;

whether you'll take it up
or bring it down...

or whether you'll
ever see an orange again.

Makes for
a long night.

That night's been around
for thousands of years...

full of men waiting
to go into battle.

I think they've all been
talking all night long.

Yeah.

You got chops you
haven't even dreamed of.

Your instincts and
training will take over.

Count on it.
You had a brilliant teacher.

I've been pretty
arrogant with you.

Mm-hmm.

I know I'm great,
but you're the best.

No, you're better.
I can't learn anymore.

Every time we went up
I kept thinking...

''How'd that kid
figure that one out?''

You're a natural.

You've got
a lot of talent.

How about that roll-out
you did during the fly-off?

Only you could do that.
I'm not saying I'm not a genius.

I joined the army for
the same reason you did:

to kick ass, like in
the old war movies.

That's what I'm
looking for in you.

An All-American hero...

with his heart and
brain wired together...

cooking full tilt
for freedom and justice.

It's the corniest story
in the whole world.

By God, this could
be a happy day.

[ P.A. System ]
We're under attack.!

Let me repeat,
we are under attack.!

Billie,
Colonel...

incoming
missiles.!

Let's get 'em
in the air!

Get the helicopters
in the air!

Get up,
get up!

[ Billie ]
Scott's dead. I'm on my own.

[ Little ]
This is Rattler. Do you copy?

Night Rider Six.

How many?

They shot down Rives
and Tippet on take-off.

Davis and Proctor are
with the Black Hawks.

[ Little ]
Guthrie,you have...

two bad boys looking
for something to do.

Locate ground radar.

When you find it,
we'll blow it up.

I don't want them
knowing where we're at.

[ Billie ]
Roger, Rattler.

Rebel is hunting.

Found it.
Site unmanned.

Proceed to 3 708.

We're on our way.

[Jake ]
Stoller's out there. I can smell him.

Go find him, kid.

[ Little ]
We're coming up on the coordinates.

Find me some high-tech
shit on that canyon.

Rice man.
I see it.

Locking in
the missiles.

[ Little ]
Make it go away.

Good shootin'.

[ Little ]
What's happening, Guthrie?

[ Billie ]
There it is.

[ Little ]
What's happening?

Rebel's located airstrip.
Evacuation underway.

Request fire support.

Fast-mover bogey
at heading 07 0.

This area
is heavily armed.

Apaches rolling in hot.

[ Little ]
That's yours, Stinger.

[ Billie ]
I'm picking up something else.

It's Stoller!

[Jake ]
Keep moving.

Don't give him
a target.

God.

He's closing!

If you keep moving,
he can't lock on.

I'm on my way.

Oh,Jake,
save my ass.

[Jake ] You're not touching her,
you filthy piece of shit.

[ Breaker]
Don't let him get away.

Have you engaged?
We're on him.

[ Little ]
Grab your ass.

[Jake ]
You've gotta nail him.

Missed!
Stay on him.

[ Breaker] Shit!

[ Breaker]
He's getting away!

[Jake ]
Damn, he's fast.

Where is he?

[ Breaker]
I hear him.

[Jake ]
That's not Stoller.

[ Breaker]
I got him.

We've got a fast-mover,
coming hot and heavy.

[ Little ]
Listen to your old coach.

Bring him to me, and Rice
will punch his lights out.

[ Breaker ]
We'll never make it.

[ Little ]
Lead him on and bring him to us.

Get me closer.

[ Little ]
I don't want to lose this kid.

If I could get
around that ridge.

He's on us!
Down on 3.

Stay on him.
We got him.

Missile lock!
We're there.

Look for
the sweet spot.

Lock on.!

Not bad shootin'
for an old dog like you.

Thanks, Grandpa.

Solid gold,
Rattler.

What goes on,
Guthrie?

Unmasking
to take a peek.

Fast-mover
at your 1 :00.

They got a whole
air force down here?

It's Stoller!
He's on our 6!

He's tracking Little.
Coming around.

[ Little ]
We're gonna get shot at.

Where is he?

We lost the
tail rotor!

How's the
main rotor?

RPM dropping!

[Jake ]
I'm pulling Stoller out.

He's on our ass.
Oh, yeah?

Mayday,
mayday!

This is Rattler.
We are going in.

Hang on, big boy.

Mayday!
We are going in.

[ Rice ]
Find us a soft spot.

He missed!

[Jake ]
Billie, check on Rattler.

[ Billie ]
He's in sight. There was no fire.

I'm going in to see
if they're alive.

That make
you nervous?

[ Breaker]
Stoller's making me nervous.

[Jake ]
We're out of here.

How's it going, Calvin?
Only my mother calls me that.

I am your mother now, Calvin.

Rice?
Dead.

Can you move?
My legs are broken.

Get your ass
in here.

See if we have
a good stinger.

He's on us.

Not for long.

This one
looks okay.

Get the grip stock
and the B.C.U.

What?

A cigar-box
looking thing...

and a round thing that
looks like a coffee can.

20 seconds.

Screw it into
that cigar box.

Pop 3 latches
on that missile.

[Jake ]
Let's wax him.!

Shit.!

Put the flat end
in the dirt.

Point the
pistol grip down.

Hinge the cigar box
onto the missile.

Okay.

Pop that latch.

Open up the square
thing on the side.

He's turning
inbound.

Put it on
your shoulder...

and pull down the metal thing
with your right thumb.

You are now
activated.!

Guthrie,
turn around.

He's in my sight!
Shoot him in the ass.

Snort that,
sucker.

We got him.

He's going vertical.
Where'd he go?

He's in the sun.

He's on our ass!

Get ready to throw
the dog a bone.

He's getting
position!

I'm hit!

How bad?
I can't shoot.

[Jake ]
Hang tight. He's mine.

Come on.
Come to daddy.

[Jake ]
Brace yourself.

Let's see how good
he really is.

Oops,
you blew it.

I'm gonna
kill him now!

That was for Dobbs.

 Request permission
to join Fire Bird support at airstrip.

 D.E.A. troops
are mopping up Fire Bird now.

They've arrested
all cartel members.

Once you took out Stoller,
it was over.

Come on home.

Where's Billie
and Little?

We just got
confirmation on them.

They're alive.
Rice is dead.

Little is hurt,
but Billie's with him.

That medevac bird
is leaving.

You're gonna
miss the bus.

All right.

Christ, this hurts.

Where's the meat wagon?
-Just over the hill.

You drop me,
it'll be the end of life...

in the army for you.

Did you kill him?

Yeah, I killed him.

Good, son.
Well done.

You look like a first-class hero, Chief.

You, too. You both do.


First-class, All-American!


You did it.

We did it.

Okay, we did it.

I'm not gonna argue.

Oh, yeah? Since when?


I'll give you a ride home.

Great. I'll drive.
No, I'm driving.

I'll drive.
It's my helicopter. I'll drive.

No, no. I drive.
