[groaning sleepily]

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>I can fit</i> <i>a couple more boxes,</i>

but we'll have to wait
till Jack gets in

to load
the rest of the stuff out.

Yeah,
if he comes in.

What's going on
with you two?


You'd have to ask him.

He hasn't had much to say
these last few months, you know?

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>Harvey's looking</i>

exceptionally rough
this morning.


Yeah, I seriously doubt
he's feeling any pain.

I don't know about you,

but I am looking forward
to getting the hell out of here.

I thought you liked
being away from the city.

I did, but too much tranquility
can drive a person crazy.

You know what I'm saying?

<i>I think I might</i>

do some traveling,
see where I end up.

You've been able
to save that kind of money

working this job?

Well, I put
a little bit away.

I don't exactly live

an extravagant lifestyle
out here.

So you don't know
what you're gonna do, then?

Haven't given it much thought,
I guess.

I've always just moved on
to the next job with Jack.

Well, uh, maybe you two
can work things out.

Maybe.

[ominous music]

â™ª â™ª

<i>[groaning]</i>



[horns honking]

Jesus Christ.

<i>I've been following</i>

those bastards
for the last half hour.

Is there something
I can help you with?

Yeah, I need
my gaming license renewed.

Thought I'd check out
the hunting around here.

<i>I heard it's good</i>
<i>this time of year.</i>

Thought I'd try my luck.

Sorry, man,
can't help you there.

We closed up shop yesterday.

<i>About four hours from now,</i>
<i>we're gonna be</i>

heading out of here
with the last of those buses.

You mean the whole place
is packing it in?

Close to it, I guess,
except for a handful of locals.

<i>They finished construction</i>
<i>on the dam here</i>

<i>a couple of weeks ago.</i>

Not much left
to stick around for anymore.

<i>Afraid you're gonna have</i>
<i>to go back to Pineview</i>

to get that license renewed.

You want me to backtrack
something like 60 miles

for a lousy piece of paper?

[ominous music]

<i>How long did you say</i>
<i>you were planning</i>

<i>on sticking around for?</i>

Couple days.

Did you say you were
traveling by yourself?

<i>Yeah.</i>

Ah, what the hell?

<i>It's not like anyone's</i>
<i>gonna be around</i>

<i>to check it anyway.</i>

Thanks.

Besides, I'm a bad shot,
you know.

Nine times out of ten,
I come back empty-handed.

It's more
the thrill of the chase.

Yeah, well, maybe you'll have
better luck this time.

[engine turns]

I owe you one.

I'm very happy to tell you
I won't be around to collect.


[ominous music]

[woman screams]

Oh, Jesus.

<i>(Laura)</i>
<i>He had a knife.</i>

Where is it?

He had it
when he came in.

On the floor.

I said on the floor now!

<i>(Harvey)</i>
<i>What the fuck</i> <i>is going on?</i>

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>You take one more step, kid,</i>

I will not hesitate
to shoot you right here.

Jesus.

<i>What the...</i>

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>All right,</i> <i>you sick fuck,</i>

back the hell up!

<i>(Laura)</i>
<i>Stuart.</i>

Stuart.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

All right,
you sick fuck,

just back the hell up!

<i>(Laura)</i>
<i>Stuart.</i>

You got to take
a look at this.

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>Jesus.</i>

[woman gasping]

[footsteps crunching]

[knife shinging]

Please, don't.

I'll do whatever
you want me to.

Please don't.


Amy,
I'll be right there.

Aw, Jesus.

Up here, Jack.

They're right here.

Jack,
please help me.

[moaning and screaming]


[gasping and moaning]

I can't even
feel my arms.

You're okay.

I'm cold.

It's okay, Amy.


[sobbing quietly]

I'll be right back.

You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

I won't let you
out of my sight.

<i>It'll be okay.</i>

Please, Jack.

You're safe,
I promise.

Jack.

[ominous music]

â™ª â™ª

[crunching leaves]


â™ª â™ª

[Amy screaming]


[Amy whispering]
Jack.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Easy, Jack.

For Christ's sake,
Stuart.

You weren't
answering your phone.

It's in a box somewhere,

where I plan on keeping it
for a long time.

We need you
down at the station, Jack.

I'm done
with that place.

Whatever it is,
you handle it.

I don't think so.

You're gonna want to see this
for yourself.

<i>(man)</i>
<i>Is it true,</i> <i>Sheriff?</i>

You're leaving too?

I was gonna stop by
this afternoon

and tell you myself.

It's been
almost a year

since you turned your back
on my daughter.

Now you're doing it again.

I'm not turning my back
on her, Albert.

There's nothing more
I can do.

They never found
Amy's body.

She could
still be out there.

You should
still be looking.

Look, the sheriff in Pineview
has Amy's file now.

He promised to contact me
if there's anything new.

My daughter is gone
because of you.

That's something
that's never gonna change.

[tires squealing]

You okay?

You find the knife?

No.

I looked;
it's not here.

The handle of the knife,
what color was it?

What color was it?

Kid was standing
in the middle of the room

covered in blood.

I can't say
I was paying much attention

to the knife.

Did you see
the color of it or not?


Red, I think.

It was hard to tell.

What does it matter?

Hey, Sheriff.

Hey, Harvey.

Find the knife.

You hungry?

<i>Need something</i>
<i>to drink?</i>

You have someone
you want us to call?

Parents?
A friend?

My deputy
checked you over,

so we know
the blood wasn't yours.

That leaves us
with two possibilities.

One: It's animal blood,

and this is
some kind of prank.

If that turns out
to be the case,

I think we can work it

so you're home
in time for dinner.

Possibility number two:

It's human blood.

If that turns out
to be the case,

I can guarantee you
this is the last chance

you're gonna have
to help yourself.

I find it
hard to believe

that someone who just made
the kind of entrance you did

doesn't have anything
to say.

Have it your way.

[ominous music]

â™ª â™ª

Did either of you
leave him in there

without the cuffs on
at any point?

Nope.

Don't look at me.

Then how
do you explain this?

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>I don't like this, Jack.</i>

Getting Ray
on the phone.

Getting some help
up here.

<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>No goddamn way.</i>

I don't know what kind of game
this son of a bitch is playing,

but I'm not playing this time.

What do you mean
this time?

It's him, Stuart.

<i>He comes back here</i>
<i>just as we're leaving,</i>

singles me out
in every one of those photos,

brings the same hunting knife
with him.

It's him.

[blood squelching]

So why would he
just show up like this?

I think he's taken
someone else.

He's here
to throw it in my face.

[blood squelching]

So what do you make
of that?

Some sort of trick.

Just one of his games.

So now what?

We start unpacking,
I guess.

Now, get on the radio

and see if Doc
is still in town.

â™ª â™ª

Looks like
you're getting ready

to open the place back up.

Yeah, no.

I'm just trying to keep it
from falling apart.

I, uh...

I was cleaning out the last
of my stuff this morning,

and I thought Jessica

would probably
have wanted you to have that.

Ooh, yeah.

That was that last day,
wasn't it?

That was the last time
I saw her alive.

I still can't
really believe

she's gone,
you know?

Such a freak accident.

Well, they never
should have built that dam,

if you ask me.

<i>Her and her father</i>

knew it was
dangerous work,

but they loved it.

And she loved
working with you.

<i>And you're...</i>

you're like family,

and I'm losing you too.

Well, you could
come with me.

Naw.

It's not like there's anything
keeping you here.

I know;
I thought about it.

But, you know,
Jessica and her dad

are buried here,

<i>and, well,</i>
<i>it just gives me</i>

a little peace of mind
to be near them.

<i>[Jack over radio]</i>
<i>Doc, it's Sheriff Sheppard.</i> <i>Are you there?</i>

<i>Doc, it's Jack.</i>

I, uh--
I-I should get that.

Wait, Darby,

<i>when you pull out tonight,</i>
<i>would you come by here?</i>

I have some family
stopping by,

and they would love
to meet you.

Oh.

I wish I could,

but I got the trailer,

and I was hoping to get down
to Pineview before dark.

Okay.

<i>[Jack over radio]</i>
<i>Doc, it's Sheriff Sheppard.</i> <i>Are you there?</i>

I-I got to go.

<i>Listen, you--</i>

you take care
of yourself.

Okay?

And, uh,
and please stay in touch.

I'm gonna call you
as soon as I get settled.

Jack, it's Darby.
What's up?

<i>Doc,</i>
<i>you still in town?</i>

Uh, yeah,
not for much longer.

Why?

Um, I was hoping
you could test

some blood samples
for me,

tell me if they're human
or animal.

Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Jack,

but, uh,
I'm just a glorified medic.

<i>Besides, I don't really have</i>
<i>the equipment.</i>

Improvise.

<i>It's important.</i>

Why the urgency, Jack?

I can't really say.

I'm never getting out of here,
am I, Jack?

All right,
meet me at the campsite.

I'll see what I can do.

<i>Stuart's already</i>
<i>on his way.</i>

Harvey.

Do you think you could
get on the radio,

check in
with whoever you can,

see if they've seen
or heard anything?

Yeah.

Yeah, I think
I could manage that.

And don't be
too specific.

We have the boy.

No sense
panicking anyone.


You got a deal.

<i>[laughs]</i>

Where are the walkies?

Packed up
with everything else.

[gun clicks]

Where are you going?

He left a lot of blood.

I'm gonna see
if it leads anywhere.

You weren't even
coming in today, were you?

You were just gonna leave.

[typewriter clacking]

[radio static]

[ominous music]

â™ª â™ª

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>Is this gonna work?</i>

This came
from one person?

Off one person.

Best I can tell,

it's the blood
of about three humans.

What the hell
is going on?

I don't know,
but whatever it is,

it just got
a hell of a lot worse.

[intense dramatic music]

â™ª â™ª

Jesus Christ,
what the hell was that?

<i>[man whispering]</i>
<i>Help me.</i>

[frenzied music]

<i>(Harvey)</i>
<i>Mary.</i>

Mary, Mary,
this is Harv.

<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

<i>So, uh,</i>
<i>have you seen anything</i>

<i>out of the ordinary?</i>

[birds fluttering]

[muffled voices
talking and whispering]

Don't leave me, Jack.

Help me, Jack.

Help me, Jack.

<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>God damn it,</i> <i>come out and show yourself.</i>

Jack.

Help me, Jack.







[typewriter clacking]

<i>(Harvey)</i>
<i>Charlie, Charlie--</i>

<i>Harv.</i>

<i>Right.</i>

<i>Have you seen anything</i>
<i>out of the ordinary?</i>

<i>No, no.</i>

You know, only some
odd kind of characters.

Well, you know,
like me.

<i>Charlie.</i>

<i>Charlie.</i>

<i>Can you hear me?</i>

<i>I turned you off.</i>

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>That blood came</i> <i>from at least three people.</i>

Jesus, Stuart.

Did you hear
what I just said?

The blood off that kid

<i>came from more</i>
<i>than one person,</i>

<i>at least three people</i>
<i>if not more.</i>

Is Darby sure?

<i>Pretty damn sure, yeah.</i>

Where's Jack?

He's out trying to track
the kid's trail.

Now where are you going?

Jack should know about this,
don't you think?

I mean, there was
a shitload of blood.

<i>Who knows what the hell</i>
<i>the kid's done?</i>

City boy,

<i>you're just gonna</i>

get yourself lost.

<i>Besides, I need you</i>
<i>to fingerprint our guest.</i>

Why can't you do it?

You're scared of him,
aren't you?

Are you gonna do it
or not?

Where are the cards?

[leaves rustling]

[eerie music]

â™ª â™ª

[blood squelching]

[handcuffs cinching]

Oh, I'd be getting used
to these cuffs if I were you.

Because juvenile or not,

you're gonna pay for whatever
it is you've done here.

You see,

people have had their fill
of kids like you.

<i>They just don't give a shit</i>
<i>how sad your story is.</i>


[electric zapping]

Jesus, Stuart,
took you long enough.

What the hell
were you doing in there?

[Jack panting]

<i>splash!</i>

[faint gunshots]


What the hell happened?

Stuart shot him.

For no reason,
like it was nothing.

I can't seem
to make her understand.

I saw the things he'd done.

<i>I saw their faces.</i>

<i>I heard them beg</i>
<i>for their lives.</i>

He had it coming.

Jesus Christ, Stuart.

It's Harvey, for God's sake!

Jack, listen to me.
The boy showed me it all.

<i>You guys have no idea</i>
<i>the shit he's done.</i>

He had to pay!

Cuff him to the cell
till I figure out

what the hell
is going on here.

Jesus Christ,
listen to me.

You would have done
exactly the same thing.

Shut up, Stuart!

There's someone else out there.

[faint beeping]

Are these the boy's prints
you ran?

Yeah.


There must be something wrong
with the system.


Reset it and send them again.


On second thought,
get Ray on the phone.

Tell him we need
some help up here.

You and I
need to have a long talk.

<i>[rotary phone clicking]</i>

<i>[phone ringing]</i>

This is Russell.

Ray, it's Laura.

<i>Laura,</i>
<i>I was just about to call you.</i>

Is Stuart Dempsey
up there with you now?

Yeah, yeah. He's here.

<i>Ray, we've got</i>
<i>a bit of a situation.</i>

This kid shows up this morning,
naked, covered in blood.

Laura, now, you listen to me
very carefully.

You stay the hell away from him.

You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

I don't understand.

He's just a boy, right?

<i>Laura, for Christ's sake,</i>

do not let him touch you.

He's not what he seems.

[line clicks]

Ray?

Ray?

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Ray,</i>

they just found
another two bodies.

That makes 36 so far.

What the hell's going on?

I don't know.

My daughter's with one now.

I got to go.

<i>Ray!</i>

I've had enough of this shit,
you hear me?

I want to know
who else is out there.

You better start talking,
or you're on your way

to the worst beating
of your life.

Let go of him, Jack.

Get out of here, Laura.

<i>God damn it, Jack.</i>

Get the hell away from him,
now!

Listen to me.
Listen to me!

I was just trying
to scare the bastard.

<i>I wasn't gonna do anything</i>
<i>to him.</i>

<i>(Laura)</i>
<i>You were touching him, Jack.</i>

Jesus, he said
not to let him touch you. Who?

It's like he already knew
what was happening here.

Who, Laura?

Ray, on the phone.

He was trying to warn me about
the boy when the line went dead.

<i>(Stuart)</i>
<i>Hey, guys--</i>

you need to look at this.

Not now, Stuart.

<i>Every person in these</i>
<i>fingerprint reports</i>

went missing
within 100 miles of here.

<i>But see,</i>
<i>here's the real kicker:</i>

<i>If you put</i>
<i>all their faces together.</i>

It looks a lot like
our boy in there.

This doesn't make sense.

<i>(eerie voices)</i>
<i>These are not sensible times,</i> <i>Jack.</i>

Jack.

Jack, no.

Ray said
to stay away from him.

[suspenseful music]

â™ª â™ª

Do you have any idea
what it feels like

to have your flesh cut open

and then slowly sewn
back together

while you're still alive?

What it feels like
to be strung up,

having every drip of blood
slowly drained from your body?

(Amy's voice)
I'd still be alive if you hadn't left me, Jack.

Amy?

[heartbeat pulsing]

[Amy faintly]
Please don't!

I'll do whatever
you want me to!

Please don't!


[flesh ripping]


<i>(Laura)</i>
<i>Jack.</i>

what just happened?

You can unlock Stuart.

We're gonna need his help.

[blood squelching]

[eerie music]

â™ª â™ª

[ominous music]

â™ª â™ª

[radio static]

<i>(Darby)</i>
<i>Darby Owens</i> <i>to Sheriff Sheppard.</i>

Jack, it's Darby.
Are you out there?

[feedback and static]

Listen, Jack,
I don't know if you can hear me.

Maybe your power's out too,

but I took another look

at that sample
you sent over earlier, and...

those cells have been dead
for a long time,

some for almost a year.

[twig snaps]

Jack, I'm getting ready
to get out of here,

so if I don't hear from you,

I'm gonna stop by the station
on my way out.

Over.


Hello?

Hello!

Hello?


[eerie whispering]

[door unlatching]

I didn't think
I could hate this place

any more
than I already did,

but, boy, was I wrong.

I got to get as far away
from here as possible, man.

You're not seriously thinking
of leaving--not now.

Fuck, yeah, Jack,
and if you and Laura are smart,

you'll do
exactly the same thing.

You killed a man, Stuart.

There's gonna be questions.

You're goddamn right there's
gonna be questions,

but who the hell's gonna
believe the answers, Jack?

Christ, if you hadn't
seen it for yourself,

I'd still be cuffed
to that cell in there.

Amy and the others
sent that boy here for a reason.

If you're not gonna help me,

I'm gonna lock you
in the cell again.

[eerie music]

â™ª â™ª

This is gonna get a lot worse
before it gets better, isn't it?

I think that's pretty much
a guarantee.

[dramatic music]

â™ª â™ª

[prolonged squishing sound]

Did you hear that?

We're on our way.

I'm gonna drive out

<i>and check</i>
<i>the power transformer.</i>

Just stay here
till we get back.

We're gonna be sitting
in the dark soon

<i>if we don't</i>
<i>get the power back on.</i>

Look, it's not a good idea to be
out there alone, all right?

Just wait,
and we'll go together.

[engine turns]

[siren wailing]

We hit a kid.

<i>(man #2)</i>
<i>He runs out in front of the bus</i> <i>like it was nothing.</i>

Like he didn't
even see us.

Where is he?

We've been looking--
maybe got thrown.

We were coming down

<i>the hill pretty good,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

Where's the driver?

He's in the bus.

<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

Samuel, is it?

Sam.

<i>Sam.</i>

Sam, I was hoping
you could help me

get this bus
off the road.

[engine grinding]

[blood squelching]

[rumbling and creaking]


Jack!

Oh, shit.

[sobbing frantically]


[gun clicks]


She's solid--
not moving anywhere.

<i>How's the head?</i>

I've had worse.

You have anyone in town
you can stay with?

He can stay
with me.

Good.

So what do you want me to do?

Start with these two
and three others.

Get 'em all into town.

All right, everyone,
listen up!

<i>We're gonna get everyone</i>
<i>out of here with the truck,</i>

<i>so it's gonna mean</i>
<i>a few trips.</i>

So stay together,
stay with the bus,

and don't touch the blood.

[blood squelching]

[blood squelching]

splash!

She took one of the rifles
with her.

God damn it,
I asked her to stay here.

You want me to go after her?

No, get everyone
from the bus into town.

I'll wait here.

She'll probably
be back soon.

All right.

I'll keep an eye out.

Okay.

[siren wailing]

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Okay, who wants some cake?</i>

<i>(Albert)</i>
<i>Go on, give her a hug.</i>

<i>Give her a hug.</i>

<i>How'd it go?</i>

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Good for you.</i>

<i>(Albert)</i>
<i>All right.</i>

<i>(Amy)</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>


Albert?

[muffled giggle]

Is everything okay
in there?

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>Yeah, this is fork three.</i>

<i>(man)</i>
<i>It's a
