[police siren wailing]


Stop right there!

It's just a stupid car.

You're gonna make it worse on yourself.

Freeze! Stop! Freeze!

Stop right there!


We're going over to the wall.


Get this hand behind your back!
There you go.

What are the odds we call this a warning?
Not good.

Let's go! We're going!

Will.


You stole a cop car.

Six years. Seven schools.

Twenty-two homes.
[scoffing]

That's gotta be a record,
and not one to be proud of.

as an accomplishment.

I'm glad you think it's funny.

This time it's serious, Will.

That leaves me no choice
but to remand you to a state facility.

Juvie?

Mark, come on, you can't be serious.

You've been through a lot.
I'll do better.

You're smart.

Talented.
Hey, I'll change.

For real this time.

There's gotta be something else!
There's not.

I'm sorry, Will.
That group home was the last option.

I know it's been hard since you lost
your parents, but you're a great kid.

I just hope for your own sake,

you figure that out
sooner rather than later.

[knocking on door]

Kristin's here to see you.

[door closes]


I'll be right back.

Hey, Kristin, how are you?
[Kristin] I'm fine. Thanks.

Kristin.

[evocative music playing]


Well, today's your lucky day.

Good news. This is Kristin.

She's one of our fosterÂ parents
and her son.

George. I'm George.

Umm...

Hi.
Nice to meet ya.

You too.
Will, I was discussing it with Mark,

and we would be excited
if you would join us this year.

Where?

You are going to summer camp.

Mark, I'm not really camp material.

All right then, uh,Â juvie it is.

Sorry, guys, thanks for trying.
Wait, juvie?


No, hey, wait.

Uh...

Summer camp sounds perfect.
You're gonna love it.

You are gonna love it.

I'm so totally excited. You play guitar.
We're gonnaÂ rock the talent show.

Plus, there's swimming
in the lake, a zip line.

It's gonna be epic.
I'll show you the ropes.

[rock music playing]

<i>â™ª Started out this morning

<i>â™ª Chasing thoughts inside my head â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Of all that I had to do today â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Another time around the circle
Try to make it better than the last â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª I opened up the Bible
And I read about me â™ª</i>

And you.
Me?

<i>â™ª Said I've been a prisoner

<i>â™ª Somewhere between the pages â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And we're gonna kill it this year! â™ª</i>

We're gonna kill it, baby.

I'm sure you will.
Will!

Oh, Will, there you are.
<i>- </i>So, I'm guessing it's Will?

Yeah, Avery, Sean,
and Sean's squad. This is Will.

New kid. Nice to meet you.

You too.

So, how do you two know each other?
[George] Um, Will is my...

We're family, cousins.
I'm visiting from Philly for the summer.


[stammering] Family.
Mm-hmm.

What about you? Where are you from?

I just got back from the Arctic,
helping to save the narwhals.

Narwhals?
Yes.

I didn't think those were real.
I thought they were like unicorns.

Majestic unicorns of the sea.

Ah.

I'm just doing my part, you know?

Taking this one next year.
What?

Right?
What?

Taking her?
Yeah.

I actually never said that.
All right, fellas.

[squad harmonizing]

<i>â™ª We'll travel over
All the mountains so high â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll go through valleys below â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Still through it all
We'll find that â™ª</i>

That's what I do.

Wow. Is he for real?

He is very, very real. Anyway...

[all cheering]
Hi, George.

[campers chattering]


this was church camp.

Hey, David.
Hey!

It's the last week of summer.
Are you ready?

Five hundred percent.
Leaves and hearts will be a-changing.

Yes! So what do you
have planned for the tribunal?

It's pretty exciting. Two words.

[in Scottish accent]
<i>Braveheart!</i>

Well, that's actually one word.

Oh.

Oh! Look, here's Will Hawkins' file.

Oh, right.
Social Services put everything in there.

What's this? Is this real?

He triedÂ to sell his high school
on Craigslist?

Mm-hmm! That boy got three offers.
[chuckles] Okay.

Uh, is this kid something
I gotta be worried about?

I seem to remember
a certain bad boy back in the day.

Yeah, back when I had
a glorious head of man-hair.


George is showing him the ropes.
It's actually kinda cute.

You got him staying in the...
Yeah, the legit cabin.

Yeah, it's, um...
It's...

Yeah.
Yeah.

It is.
It is.

[tense music playing]

Mmm. She's a classic.

That's a word for it.


Hello, old friend.

You actually chose this cabin?

Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't?

The toilet backs up, when it works.
There's no AC... Oh, and the spiders.

Spiders?

Huh.

I guess they haven't
come out yet. Anyway.

Oh well.

Oh, by the way, what was that back there?
The whole family slash cousins thing?

I don't mean to be a prude,

but lying's up there on the top ten
"Thou shalt nots."

I wasn't ready.
It made me kinda uncomfortable.

It doesn't really fly...
Yeah, I totally get it.

Oh, you get it?
[Will] Yeah, I do.


That's a relief 'cause
I'm not trying to be uncool.

You like the view.

What?

The view.

No, that's not it at all.
Careful. Lies are up there.

What's her name?

[dreamy music plays]


Dean's list four years straight.

Loves all things cute and cuddly,
specifically anything pug-related.

little shoe size.

Seven and a half, narrow.

We're gonna have to work on
this stalker vibe you got going on.

What about Avery? What's her story?

Trust me.

Really? Ouch.

Yeah, how should I say this?

I don't know if she'd be into the whole
"stealing a cop car" kinda guy.

First of all, borrowed a cop car.
Second of all, how did you even know that?

Oh. Georgie's got ears everywhere.

what would she be into?

Like, what's her deal?

Uh, this camp, honestly.

She practicallyÂ lives here.
Her dad owns the place.

What about her mom?

Let me guess, she's off
saving the world like Mother Teresa.

No. She's...

Doesn't really talk about it.

She spends most of the summer
as a counselor and, uh,

this is the only time
she gets to be a normal camper like us.

And watch out, she's crazy competitive.


[George chuckles]

George, you said that telling
the truth wasn't an option.

No. I'm just not super sure
Avery would be into it.

That kinda sounds
like the same thing, dude.


I have to make this camp thing work. Okay?

If I'm going to fit here,
I have to be something I'm not.

That's where you come in.

Right, Georgie?
Um...

How about this? If you help me,
then I'll help you

with Miss Presley Elizabeth Borscht.

Borscht? Barber?
[George] Borsky.


All you gotta do is keepÂ our secret,
show me the ropes.

That's it.

So I guess I'd be like...

[imitating Yoda]
Your Yoda, I will be.

Yes. Sure. My Yoda.
[continues in Yoda voice]Â Mmm.

Lesson one, my young Padawan.
You can stop talking like that.

Shorts, wear them, you must.


[in normal voice] You're welcome.
Got plenty. Welcome to camp.

You're a really weird dude.

Thank you.

[upbeat music playing]

Why are they so itchy?

Polyester blend. Or as I like to call it,
God's gift to fashion.

I smell like old people.

This is my super real cousin Will,
just visiting from out of town.

We're related.
Easy, tiger.

[Will] What's the plan, Rain Man?
[George] Take your pick.

Archery, baking club...
Oh, what about that?


Okay, we are definitely
signing up for that.

Uh, no paintball, I never do paintball,
I wasn't really built for that.

Today's the day.
No, stop, don't go over there.

I don't want to. Don't invalidate me.
Hey, guys, how's it going?

Hey! It's, um, it's Will, right?

Ah! Good memory, um, Avery.
Thanks. Funny.

Let me guess, you're on the red team?
Yeah, Crimson Angels.

Did you come up with that name?

Why?

I'm just trying to decide
how honest to be in my opinion.

Oh! That's funny.

I, uh, was thinking the same thing
about your shorts.

[chuckling] TouchÃ©.
[Avery laughs]

And you must be Presley.

Yeah, hi, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Hey, George.

[chuckles bashfully]

George was actually just telling me
all about you earlier.

Really?
No, no, no...

Nothing weird or anything.
Right.

I... We're cousins for the summer.
I love the summer.

He's my cousin and we're here.
Cool.

The summer.
It's okay.

I was just showing him around. No biggie.

That's awesome, George. [chuckles]


This'll be fun to do it together.
[George clears throat]

Where do I sign?
Here.

[George] Don't write my name. Forgery.
I'm signing your name.

[Avery] You'll be great.
Excited, because...

There we go.
- [George clears throat]


Good luck, Will...

Hawkins.

You're gonna need it.

Luck?
[Avery] Yeah.

Okay.
[Avery] Okay.

See you there.
See you around, George.

Mm-hmm.


Let's go.
Yeah.


That was good. You looked good.
That time.

Dude, what was that?
I know. [groans]

I can talk to anybody
but Presley. It sucks.

So, it looks like George
still has a thing for you.

Come on, he can't even look at me.

Presley could have any guy she wants.
Trust me, all right? I tried last year.

I wrote her a letter every single day.

I didn't ever send them.

Maybe you should invest in some stamps.

I'm telling you,
if the two of you just would talk.

You just gotta talk to her.

Yeah.

[girls talking indistinctly]

Dude, come on.

<i>â™ª I don't even know
What I would sa</i> y <i>if I wanted to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not exactly what the kids
These days are calling cool â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't overthink it, man
Just do you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I were you
Maybe that would be true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What if I try to talk all smart
And only dumb comes out? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just a pretty face
Like, that's the only thing I'm about â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's way more to you â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Oh, I hope that's true â™ª</i>
Well, it is.

<i>â™ª Can't help but wonder
If I'm good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just don't think
That I am good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª She don't even see me â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª He's way out of my league â™ª</i>
What are you talking about?

<i>â™ª So stop talking crazy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's just no way
That you're not good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't let them tell you
You're not good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A little weird is a good thing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª God made you just how you should be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Good enough
More than good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wish you could see
How amazing you are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You just gotta be you
Don't break yourself apart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna see myself like you do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just gotta own it, girl
It's so true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The only way you could go wrong
Is if you doubt yourself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Confidence is everything
No need to be someone else â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's so easy for you â™ª</i>

Eh. That's true.
Come on.

<i>â™ª Can't help but wonder
If I'm good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just don't think that
I am good enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª He don't even see me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Good enough
More than good enough â™ª</i>

Okay.

[boys and girls vocalizing]
Mm.

<i>â™ª Trust me, I know you're afraid â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Be who you are, man
Who cares what they say? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And you'll be all right
Just show 'em your light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Get out of your own way â™ª</i>

[George] Lay of the land.
[Will] Hit me.

Camp's divided into three teams.
I'm Verdes Maximus.

[Sean] Georgie boy and new kid!
Looking good, Stuart.

Excuse me? Did you call me Stuart?
He's turning around.

Oh my gosh.
Why did you do that?

[George] Hey, hey, hey.
Hey man, it's Sean. My name is Sean.

That's what I said, right?
That's what I heard.

Right?
Whatever.

Georgie, we're gonna
destroy you this year.

Mmm-hmm.
[Sean] Because what?

We haven't lost in how long?

Oh yeah, that's right.

<i>â™ª Never â™ª</i>

Yeah. Mmm.
Wow.

Good ear.
A long time.

Maybe you'll be one of my Apostles, Will.

Really?
Yeah.

If you have Apostles,
doesn't that make you...

Winners! Yes!
[Will] Okay, got it.

So, you're a team of Apostles. Got it.

For a second there I thought you might
have an over inflated sense of self.

[snorting, coughing]

The thing is,
I'm not sure I'm brave enough

to pull off one of those t-shirts
in public, I'll have to pass.

Oh. That's a shame
because I sell these t-shirts

to raise money
for a cause close to my heart.

I think that's him on there.
On that narwhal.

Anyways, your team's not a choice.

We'll see what happens
tonight at the tribunal.

Can't wait.

Great. Awesome.
I'll see you gentlemen tonight.

See you tonight.
You will.

Apostles out.
See you there.

Great!

[Azures whooping]
[Sean] Hoo-rah!

Oh.

Okay, let's be on our way.
Will.


We're gathered here tonight
on this hallowed ground

beneath the great moon and stars,
to honor an age old tradition.

Welcome to the tribunal!

[campers cheering]



From this day forth,

you'll be part of your tribe,
and your tribe will be part of you.

And you forever

will be part of us all.

Come forth!

Crimson Angel!

[Crimsons cheering]

Azure Apostle!

[Azures whooping]

Whoo!

Hmm...

Crimson Angel!

[Crimsons cheering]

Good to meet you, Will.

You too.


Verdes Maximus!

[campers cheering]

I pulled some strings.
Pretty cool, huh?



[Azures cheering]

[rhythmic beat playing]

<i>â™ª We are Apostles

[bugle reveille playing over PA]


<i>It's a beautifulÂ sunny day.
Everybody up. Everybody moving.</i>

<i>It's time to get this party grooving.</i>

<i>As you know, another year
of Warrior Games is at hand.</i>

<i>Will the Apostles hold onto their lead?</i>

<i>Or will another team rise
from the ashes and claim their throne?</i>

Good morning, campers.
It is a beautiful sunny day.

Everybody up. Everybody moving.
It's time to get this party grooving.


[clicks tongue]

Hello. Earth to Will.
Go away.

We get to kick total butt today.

Finally show Sean
and his mini-me's how Jedis get it done.

[imitating lightsaber]

It's gonna be epic.
No, it's not going to be epic.

I'm 17.6 miles from civilization
and surrounded by Jesus freaks.

Wow. I feel like I should be offended
but I'm actually just impressed

with your geographical skills. Like,

did you just know that?

Rule number one:

always have an exit plan.

That's rule number one?
Yes, it is.

Problem is,
all roads lead to juvie this time.

Yeah, but this time you got a George.

He's not going to let you leave.
Right? I need you for the talent show.

You're what I need
to bring the performance over the top.

And it's gonna be epic.
Please stop saying that.

Well, it's true.
I'll quit if you quit with the "boo-hoo,

I'd rather be anywhere than this place
because I'm so broody and cool."

It's not a good look, even I know that.

Look, you have a chance to do
something really solid this week.

Help me win for the first timeÂ in my life.

Bonus, hang with Avery.

And, who knows,
maybe you'll have a little bit of fun.

Like, by accident?

So, stop whining.

Suck it up.

And help me kickÂ some

Hmm?


That was a pretty solid pep talk, George.
Thank you.

Did you practice that?

I did. Was the singing too much?
I couldn't decide.

No, that's what got me.
The singing?

Mm-hmm.
Nice.

Want some Ovaltine? Apple Jacks?

No, I'm good. I got Twizzlers.
Nice.

[upbeat rock music plays]

Why would you get more of this?

I like it. It's camp.

It's gross, is what it is.
You're supposed to get a bun.

Ugh!
All right.


Five minutes!


Five minutes!

[all chanting] Five minutes!

What's going on?
You're not gonna like it.

All right! The people have spoken.

Will Hawkins!
There it is.

Oh!
It's time for your five minutes of fame.

Five minutes?
Get there.


[all chanting] Five minutes!

Five minutes!

Get up there.
Okay, I'll do it.

[Sean] Let's give it up for the new kid!
Wish me luck.

[campers cheering]



The game is five minutes of fame.

And the name of the game is to find out
who the mysterious new kid really is.

Mysterious? Huh.

[campers cheering]

[whooping]
Okay, all right.

Bring it on.

Favorite color?

Green, of course.

[Verde team cheering]

Profession?
Teenager.

Favorite movie?
<i>Twilight.</i>

[applause]
You good at sports?

If awesome is good then yeah.

[campers laughing]

Celebrity crush?
[Will] Bella Swan.

Real crush?

I'm still going with Bella.
[campers laughing]

[girl] Biggest regret?
Sitting here.

Favorite book of the Bible?

Uh...

Ah, man, you know,
I-I couldn't pick just one.

Oh, I totally get that.

[scattered laughter]

Who's your hero?

My dad.

Your favorite person?

My mom.



Let's give it up for the new kid, huh?

Huh?
[campers cheering]


How about Georgie boy?
I believe in you, cuz.

I don't know!
Come on! Come on up here.

George! George!Â George!

Okay, okay.
[campers chanting]Â George! George!

All right! Okay.

You're welcome.
[David] Will.

Thanks a lot.

Whatever happened, I swear it wasn't me.
Oh, you can relax.

I don't believe for a second
you're a <i>Twilight</i> fan.

You don't seem the type.

Don't judge a book by its cover.
I never do.

I just wanna say
I'm glad you're here, Will.

That's it. So I called you out here.
Glad you're here.

Well, thanks.

Hey, by the way, what's with the name?
Aweegaway?

Yeah, no, it's Aweegaway.

You guys are taking a week away
to hang out with us.

Oh, yeah, that makes more sense.

And bonus, every once in a while,
somebody finds out they're a week away

from an experience
that changed everything for them.

My favorite part.


Here I was thinking you were a funny guy
who was a little too into <i>Braveheart</i>.

You're right, I am a funny guy
and I do love <i>Braveheart</i>.

But don't judge a book by its cover.
TouchÃ©.

One last thing.
Don't put my camp on Craigslist.

I won't.
Okay, thank you. Well, it's time.

For what?
[siren blares]

Warrior Games, baby!

[siren blaring]

Wow.
[David] Warrior Games!

Hear ya.
Man, is that Will Hawkins, the new kid?

Thanks a lot.
You set the bar high in there.

I'm sure you were great.
If awesome is good then yeah.

[Will chuckles]
Oh my gosh.

Everyone's talking about you
and Sean hates it.

Will!
Tragic.

That was so impressive.
Oh, thank you.

Yeah, I mean, anyone can answer
questions, but it is about to get real.

[George chuckles]
[Sean] Whoo!

Warrior Games, baby!

What he said.

Whoo!
[Avery] That's right.

You're gonna beat the blob this year.
That's because I love the blob.

This girl loves the blob.
I do love the blob.

That's why I do it, Sean.
I love the blob too.

Really?
I do.

You love the blob? I thoughtÂ you...
George, you know me. I love that thing.

Great.
My friends call me "blobtastic."

That's cool.
Really? You like can't get them to stop?

I've tried, but they just seem
too overwhelmed by my skills.

Of course.

Ah, well, look,

don't feel bad because when I beat you
I won't think any less of you.

Okay.

Mr. Blobtastic.

You can call me Will.

Uh, eh... Bye. Bye, George. [chuckles]

I didn't know you blobbed.

If we go nowÂ we could get
practice jumps before anyone else.

You wanna? Come on!

Wait, back up, jumps? You didn't say
there were gonna be jumps.

George!

[rock music playing]


Can you give me
something extra on the jump?

The further I go, the higher we score.

Hello?
Huh?

Dude, that's pretty tall.

Yeah, it's the blob.
Wait, have you never...

No.

Yeah, great. Well, Blobtastic,

today's the day.

[rock music continues]

<i>â™ª The long awaited rains

<i>â™ª The wild and rushing river
Can be found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And like the rains I'm here
Where the river flows â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My heart is racing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My feet are weak as I walk to the edge â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm diving in
I'm going deep â™ª</i>

You got this!

[George screaming and laughing]

<i>â™ª There is a supernatural power

<i>â™ª It can bring the dead to life
And it can fill an empty soul â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And give a heart
The only thing worth living â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We will never know

[David on PA] <i>Get ready,
next up is an epicÂ dodgeball face off.</i>

[campers cheering]

Come on, Presley!


[grunts]
Hey! Oh, not cool.

Oh! Sorry. Didn't see you.

[upbeat rock music playing]

We can do this!

Ow!
[campers] Oh!

It's okay. You're fine.

Hey, good work.

Eye on the prize!



[tense music playing]

[in slow motion] Presley!

No!

Oh!

I'll be right back.
Wow!


Oh, poor baby.

Try this.
Thank you so much.

Hmm?
Oh.

It's cold.

Let me know if you need anything else.
You're an angel.

Thank you.

Ah!

She's right there. Just go check on her.

Come on, you can do this.
No.

George.

It's really not that bad, you know. Sorry.

I have a bag of peas on my face, Avery.

Yeah, but your hair...

it's never looked better.

Really?

No, it's actually really frizzy
and it's a little flat.

[both laughing]

George, what are you doing?
I can't go out there, forget it.

Stop pacing. Please.
[groans]

Stop!

You just don't understand.
I'll never be the guy who gets the girl.

I'm Duckie. What can I say?

What? You are the cool guy, George.

You're kinda the coolest.
I'm a sucker.

You gotta go out there and get her.
This is your moment.

Like one of those Jeff Hughes movies.
John Hughes.

John Hughes.
That's it! You have to John Hughes me.

What?

John Hughes me. The makeover montage.

We go to the mall, you get me
a leather jacket, jeans with rips in 'em,

and killer shades. It works every time.

Come on, just do it.
[sighs]

All right, I'll see what I can do.

Uh...

Now go get the girl.

That was a really quick montage.

[clicking fingers]

<i>â™ª Oh! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Uh! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, baby
I'm taken with the notion â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To love you
With the sweetest of devotion â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, baby
My tender love will flow from â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The bluest sky to the deepest ocean â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stop for a minute â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, I'm so glad you're mine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, ooh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're mine â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, baby
The stars are shining for you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And just like me
I'm sure they adore you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, baby
Go walking through the forest â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The birds above
Are singing you a chorus â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stop for a minute â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, I'm so glad you're mine
Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ever since the day
You put my heart in motion â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby, I realize
There's just no getting over you â™ª</i>

[audio playing in reverse]


Super nope.

[bugle reveille playing over PA]

It's a beautiful sunny day.</i>

<i>Everybody up. Everybody moving.
It's time to get this party grooving.</i>

<i>Afternoon water sports
have been postpone</i> d <i>due toÂ umm...</i>

<i>uh... but we're cleaning up.</i>

<i>Side note: Chef Lisa's spicy chili</i>

<i>is off the lunch menu
for the remainder of the week.</i>


<i>â™ª So long â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hurting â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lying came so naturally â™ª</i>

That's beautiful.

Oh.

Oh, sorry, I...

I was just walking.

I didn't mean to...
No, it's cool.


I thought I'd come here,
watch the sunrise.

Mh.

And George is a little perky for me
in the morning.

So...
[chuckles]


Is that, um...

something that you wrote?

Uh, just a little something
I've been working on.

So he's Mr. Blobtastic
and he plays the guitar.

That is pretty impressive.

[both chuckling]

All right, I'm up here
writing moody sunrise songs.

What's your excuse?

You know, it's kind of a personal thing,
but if you wanted to, you could come.

Pass up a mystery outing?

Let's do it.


[gentle music playing]


Are you taking me to some secret hideout?


Should I be alarmed?
No!

Okay, just checking basics.

Y'know, I'm kinda a big deal at camp,

so if I go missing,
people will come looking.

Will they?
Mmm-hmm.

Really?

[talking indistinctly]

[gentle music swelling]



I come here every year.

It is pretty much
my favorite place on the planet.

I can see why.
[chuckles]

When I was little my, um...

my mom, she got sick.

And so my dad and I
wanted to create a place

that was magical for her
when she wasn't in the hospital, so...

we made this.

My mom, her favorite were the butterflies.
There are some now,

but you come back in the spring,
I'm telling you, you...

you would not believe it.

Y'know, it's been almost eleven years.

But she's still here.

Doesn't it hurt?

Being here?

Well, yeah.

Of course, I miss her, every day, but...

I know that it's just temporary.

So you'll see her again?
A hundred percent.

A hundred percent? Wow.

I mean, I guess I don't,
I don't know-know that, but...

Yeah, no, I just choose to believe.

I mean that's faith, right?

What about you?

What?

Oh yeah.

Uh, me too.

Yeah, I was just testing you.


Okay, well, how did I do?

Nailed it. Of course.


You're pretty perfect, aren't you?

No.

No, I'm not.

It's okay, you can admit it.
No, I can't though, because I'm not.

Look, to be honest with you,

and I know youÂ didn't mean it
in a bad way or anything, it's just...

I hate that word.

Y'know, perfect, it's just impossible.

It's like I find myself doing this thing
I know that I shouldn't but,

I'm, like, trying to be what everybody
expects me to be,

and it is exhausting.

Well, I didn't mean it like that.

I know, I...

It just seems
like you have it all figured out.

[soft music playing]

<i>â™ª The wind is moving â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I am standing still â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A life of pages â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Waiting to be filled â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A heart that's hopeful â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A head that's full of dreams â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But this becoming
Is harder than it seems â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feels like I'm looking for a reason â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Roaming through the night
To find my place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not a lot to lean on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need your light to help me find
My place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If there are millions
Down on their knees â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Among the many
Can you still hear me? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hear me asking
Where do I belong? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is there a vision
That I can call my own? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Show me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm looking for a reason â™ª</i>

To find my place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not a lot to lean on
I need your light â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To help me find my place in this world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not a lot to lean on â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need your light

<i>â™ª My place in this world â™ª</i>

See?

I was right.

You're perfect.

So, um...

where do you live, again?

Y'know, after, after the summer?

Oh. Uh...

I live in New York with my older brother.
Hmm.

We're super close.
I'm really lucky to have him.

I thought you said you lived in Philly.

[siren blares]

Uh-oh! You are in trouble.

What do you mean?

[tense music playing]

[imitating LTC Kilgore] I loveÂ the smell
of paintball in the morning!

Your dad is really into this.
Yeah. Like father like daughter.

The surviving team

wins the day!

Okay, David, you do realize
they're kids, right?

I know.
[Kristin] Okay.

Charlie! No more head shots.

And remember, watch your six.

Not the 666.

No, I was... The six is your back.
'Cause if you say twelve it would be...

I hope you know how to shoot that thing.

Not the devil!
No, this is not a Biblical term at all.

Okay. All right, gotcha.


Move it!
[Kristin] Jesus loves you!

Move it!


Charlie's really enthusiastic.
Yeah, we've got to call his parents.

All right, Apostles, listen up.
It is beyond go time.

Now just go out there, okay,
and do your best.

Now, I believe in you.

This is our year, 'cause we have
something they don't have.

We have Will.

I want the new kidÂ taken out first.
Understand?

Do you think they all know
what <i>Apocalypse Now</i> is?

I don't even know
what <i>Apocalypse Now</i> is, David.

Now, what are we?
[all] Red hot!

Sorry, I can't hear you. What?


What are we gonna do?

Destroy.
Yes.

Now hands in!

Masks down.

On three. Um...

[Will] After three
After three. Yes. Thank you.

Green machine. One, two, three:

[all cheering]
Let's go!

[music playing]

<i>â™ª I don't know where you lay your head
Or where you call your home â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know where you eat your meals
Or where you talk on the phone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know if you got a cook
A butler, or a maid â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know if you got a yard
Or a hammock in the shade â™ª</i>

Pull harder!

<i>â™ª I don't know if you've got
Some shelter or a place to hide â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know if you live with friends
In whom you can confide â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know if you got a family
And see your mom or dad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know if you feel love at all
But I bet you wish you had â™ª</i>

What are you doing?
Go. Back.

Not hard.
<i>- â™ª Go with me to my father's house â™ª</i>

I'm not even worried.
<i>- â™ª Come go with me to my father's house â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's a big, big house
With lots and lots of room â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A big, big table
With lots and lots of food â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With a big, big yard
Where we can play football â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A big, big house
It's my father's house â™ª</i>

[boy] I'm open!
[girl] Not anymore!

[David on PA] <i>Somebody call heaven!
These Angels got wings!</i>

With rooms for everyone â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All I know there's lots of land
Where we can play and run â™ª</i>

And I've got a family â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All I know is you're all alone
So why not come with me? â™ª</i>

To my father's house â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come and go with me
To my father's house â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's a big, big house
With lots and lots of room â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª</i>

[music continues]

Yay!

[David over PA]Â <i>Oh, that's gotta hurt.</i>

<i>Points are adding up and it's
not looking good for the Apostles.</i>

[singers vocalizing]

What are you doing? Get up!

George!

[paintball fire whooshing]

[gasping]
Wow.

That was the nicest/weirdest thing
anyone's ever done for me.


<i>- </i>Let's go.
Paintball sucks.

I know. [chuckles]
[paintball gun firing]


I will come after you
with the wrath of God!

I'm not playing, Charlie!
Hey, hey.

What?

You do realize they're children,
don't you?



[suspenseful music playing]

[paintballs rattling]
[grunts]

[automatic paintball fire]


You're going down. Three.

Two.

One!

[rapid paintball firing]

Huh!
Whoa!

Why aren't you shooting me?
Why aren't you shooting me?

We're surrounded. If we reload
and shoot each other then Sean wins.

Okay. What are you proposing?

Temporary truce?

Okay.

Let's <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i> this thing.

Yes! Yes!

What is that again?

What? Y'know, it's like a movie.
Like <i>Mr...</i> No?

Just follow my lead, okay?
Yeah, here you go.

No, Will, that's yours too.
You're gonna shoot both.

Oh!
Okay.


On the count of three. One, two, three!

[intense music playing]


Hey! Ow! Ow!

Ow! That is so against the rules!

[both chuckle]
[firing]

Ow! Stop! I'm down!

[firing]
Ow!

Wow. That is so wrong.
Aww.

I told you, Will, I'm competitive.

Excuse me boys.

That's it! Crimson Angels are the winner!

[Crimsons cheer]
Looks like we're both losers today.

Just go.

Part of me is proud,
and part of me is neutral.

I think we got a barn burner!

Verdes Maximus is in second place!

He came from my womb.

And in third place just a couple
of points down the Azure Apostles.

Oh, no, no. This doesn't happen.

Third place!

I pray. I give blood. What is happening?

I'm an Apostle. I went to the Arctic

and I spent two months
freezing my buttocks off

to come back here and we lose.

We lose to some guy,
George's cousin. Who is that guy?

Hello, Mr. Godzilla. That looks like
a tasty Twizzler you have in your mouth.

[roaring]
Oh! Thank you so much.

I'm going to keep this Twizzler.

<i>â™ª We're jamming bros â™ª</i>

[Will vocalizing]

<i>â™ª Oh yeah with the C chord
To the A minor chord with the G chord â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Camp Aweegaway â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We're at camp Aweegaway â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Aweegaway! â™ª</i>

We suck!
Why can't we? Why are we so bad at this?

<i>â™ª Aweegaway! â™ª</i>


[belching] Finished it.
Oh wow, I'm ashamed.

<i>Life moves pretty fast.</i>

<i>If you don't stop and look around
once in a while,</i>

<i>you could miss it.</i>

So good.
Dude, it's a classic.

This camp thing's not that bad.


one simple thing to say.

I don't know all of you...

certainly not as well as I'd like to.

But God does.

He knows everything about each
and every one of you here tonight.

I don't know much, but this much I do.

He's a fan.

Ahem! Uh...

I don't know much.

But I...

Err... uh...
But this much I do.

Seeing George hit that superman pose
trying to save a certain someone.

That was, uh...

That was pretty cool, man.

That was pretty cool.

Thanks.
Yeah.

Well, I don't know much,
but this much I do.

This is the last week of our 24thÂ summer
here at Camp Aweegaway.

As my wife used to say,
God is up to something.

He's up to something good.

He's up to something amazing.

That much I know.

Ah...

I've repeated this
quite a few times to myself.

And um...

These words just mean a lot to me,
so I thought why not share them.

"For I know the plans that I have
in store for you declares the Lord...

plans to prosper you...

not to harm you...

plans to give you a hope...

and a future."

I don't know much.

But this much I do.

what you said about George, I thought.

I think Presley liked it too
I mean, she loved it.

Hey, um... How are y...

How are you feeling about all that?
Because I know it can be...

overwhelming.

It was amazing.

Really?

I don't know.

It's just...

been so long

since I felt so...

connected.

Like I was part of something bigger.

Do you know what I mean?

Yeah, I really do.

Avery.
Will.

Sorry.
Go head.

Just, can you wait just like two seconds?
I have something for you.

Oh yeah, sure.
But just two seconds, okay?

Sorry.

[gentle music playing]

Come on, just tell her the truth.

I, um...

I just wanted you to have this photo.

You don't have to keep it if it's weird.
I just, um...

I don't know, it's a good picture.

Avery, I...

Yeah?

Thank you.

Yeah, it's no problem.

So, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

See you tomorrow.

Yeah.

Okay.

Goodnight.


Oh, hey, Kristin.
Hey, Will.

Hey, lover boy. How's Avery?

She gave me this.

Aww.

Man, I look good in this.
Mind if I steal it?

Yeah, I do. [chuckles]

[George laughs]


Thanks.

Oh, wow, are those your parents?

That's them.

Can I see?

Sure.

[Kristin laughs]

You look just like your dad.
What?

Yeah.
Really?

You got a lot of peach fuzz though.
Peach fuzz? [chuckles]

Will, your mother is beautiful.

She really is.

You know, your parents
would be really proud of you.

They'd be glad I was here.

[gentle guitar playing]

I just thought the moment needed
a heartfelt score, it was so tender.

Nice, George.

You know what would be heartfelt?
If you picked up your drawers.

Come on, I just wore them.

Do you expect me
to clean my room at camp?

[Kristin] Why does it smell so bad?
[George] Boys only.

that just sticks on you.


How long you been wearing them?


[door creaking]

[papers rustling]

[drawers opening]



No way.

[chuckles softly]

<i>- </i>[reveille playing]
[David] <i>All right, campers,</i>

<i>now for a Warrior Games update.</i>

<i>In first place the Azure Apostles.</i>

<i>In second the Angels,</i>

<i>and finally Verdes Maximus
coming in third.</i>

<i>Now, don't despair,
I have it from authority on high</i>

<i>that the talent show tonight
is gonna be a game changer.</i>

<i>So warm up those juggling balls,</i>

<i>polish off those tap shoes,
and let's make some magic!</i>

All right,
my fellow Verdes Maximus monsters,

today is the day and if we all do our jobs

I think tears will be shed,

jaws will be dropped,

and heartstrings will be tugged.
[all chuckling]

We didn't come this far to be just okay.

We must be...
Epic.

What he said.
[chuckles]

Let's give it up for our fearless leader
who put this nonsense together, huh?

Okay, we're a team. But, yes,
as the leader I appreciate the validation.


I am excited.

It'll be nice to have
some decent talent show competition.

Yeah, this is a closed rehearsal, Sean.
I'm aware.

I heard the new kid would be playing
a big part in this year's performance.

So I wanted to stop by
and offer a few pointers.

Will, got a minute?

No, we have to rehearse.
It's fine.

Sean, if this is about paintball,
I'm sorry, I just...

Hey, you're good. You're good.

You can't change who you are.
I get it.

What's that supposed to mean?

Like, who you really are.

Will Hawkins.

Vandalism,

disorderly conduct, curfew violations.

Auto theft?

You lied.

You're just a big fraud.

And you need to tell Avery.

Or I'm going to.

Look.

I'm trying to do the right thing.

Yeah.

Sure you are.

Keep up the good work.

Hey.

Uh, hey. Hi, George.
Okay.

Have you guys seen Will?

Why? What's up?
I don't know.

We were trying to rehearse,
Sean walked in, said something to him

and then Will just walked out.

W-wait, Sean? What did Sean say?

I have no idea.

All right, let's go find out.

[groans]
[Avery] Come on.

[door opening]


Will isn't who he says he is.

What are you talking about?

Ask his cousin.

twenty-two homes.</i>

<i>You can't change who you are. I get it.</i>

<i>Your parent</i> s <i>would be proud of you.</i>


<i>I don't know if she'd be into
the whole stealing a cop car.</i>

I mean, that's faith, right?</i>


I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

He's lying to you.
You've gotta believe me.

You're so brave.

Hm!


[intense music plays]

Will.

Dad! Hi!
Hi, sweetie.

Uh, can I have your keys?
Where are you going?

Sean, I guess said something to Will.

I don't know what he said.
All I know is I checked his cabin.

All of his things are gone, he's gone.

Well, I'll go look for him.
No, no.

I need to go.

I think he was trying to say
something to me the other day

or I don't know, but if I go
I think he'll listen to me.

Please, you have to trust me.

[intense music continues]


Will.

Will come on, please, where are you going?

Look, I...

I know everything, okay?

Or at least I know some of it.

None of it matters,
so can you please get in the car?

We can talk about it.
There's nothing to talk about.

So do you just run away?

Is that you? Is that the real Will?
I don't have anybody, Avery.

I don't have a dad to take care of me
or a little magical garden.

That was not fair.

Yeah, you're right. It's not.

It's not fairthat my parents
were ripped from me.

[voice breaks] That I didn't get
to tell them just once more...

You don't know anything about me.
So don't pretend you do or that you care.

Why do you think I'm standing here now?

I don't know, you tell me.
Because I care.

Because you are so loved.
By whom? God?

Yes!

Then where was he? Where was he?

He didn't take me that night, no.
He left me there.

He wasn't there for me that night,
hasn't been there since.

What kind of a God is that?

Tell me.

But you know what?
It's fine. I'm fine. Okay?

You're not gonna believe me right now,
when I say this to you but I need you to...

I don't need you to fix me, Avery.

I'm not trying to fix you, Will.
Yeah, right.

Fine, then you look at me right now.

Tell me none of this meant anything.
Get out of my way.

I can't. Because you can't look at me
and you can't say it.

Because you know it's not true.
It meant nothing to me.

What?

None of it.

Can I go now.



Yeah, you can go now.

By the way, you aren't
as good of a liar as you think you are.

Kristin, I'm looking at the numbers
and with that performance

the Azure Apostles take a commanding lead.

[campers cheering]
Ahh! Yes!

We're dead.

You tried your best, okay?
It's gonna be fine.

We're gonna have fun, okay?

I know.

Did you find him?

Yeah.

Yeah, no, I found him.
Wait, what's going on? Are you okay?

[Presley] She. George, she, um...
I tried.

I don't think he's coming back.

But it's not over yet!

We have our final performance,
Verdes Maximus!

[campers cheering]

Yeah, that's my baby George.
And this should be epic!

Go get 'em.
Thanks, Mom.



What?

It meant everything.

All of it.

Thank for coming after me.

Thank you for coming back.

I'm just... I'm so sorry that...

[gentle, romantic music playing]


Your fans await.

We'll talk after, okay?
Okay.

[band begins playing]

You have to go.
Okay.

Go! [chuckles]

Verdes Maximus!

It's all right. It's all right.

[campers chanting]
Verde! Verde! Verde!

[Will and George] <i>Good morning, campers.
It's a beautiful sunny day.</i>

<i>Everybody up. Everybody moving.</i>

[David over PA]
<i>Time to get this party grooving.</i>

[vocalizing]
<i>- It was a week unlike any other.</i>

<i>Today you take home friendships
that will last a lifetime.</i>

<i>Remember that today is not goodbye,
it's see you later.</i>

<i>Go out in the world,</i>

<i>the greatÂ big awesome world
and make some magic.</i>


You killed it.
[chuckles]

Thanks, man. It means aÂ lot.

You deserve it.

You can do this.

Can I talk to you?
Yeah, what's up?


Man, I just...

just want to say I'm sorry.

You weren't the only one
trying to impress people.

Dude, don't even worry about it.
We're cool.

[both chuckle]

Yeah, but next year you're going down.

Ahh, we'll see about that.

[both chuckle]

[singing] â™ªÂ <i>Later â™ª</i>
See you, buddy.

Hey, you.
Hey, mind if I sit here?

Please.

So...

are you coming back next year or what?

Hmm, well, that depends.

Will you be here?

Yes.

Then chances are pretty good.

[both chuckle]

Hi.

Hey.

Uh... Uhh...

I-I-I, um...

Here.



It's beautiful, George.

Um, yeah, the-there are
365 letters in there for you.

Um, I kinda wrote them last year

but I think thematically they could...

I'm sorry.
[chuckles nervously]

It's just, um...

"Life moves pretty fast.

If you don't stop and look around
once in a while you could miss it!"

From my favorite movie,


Wow, someday I'm gonna marry you
Presley Elizabeth Borsky.

Not if I marry you first
George Montgomery Tanella.

[both chuckling]

Here.

See ya.

She gave me her number.


Jeez. Should I, like, emoji her?
Is that a thing?


Figure out my next move.

I'm gonna miss you, man.
I'm gonna miss you too.

All right. You boys ready to go home?

What do you mean?

Will, I'd really like for you
to come home and live with us.

I mean, If you want.

Are you serious?
So, we're like legit cousins now?


You're brothers.

Yes!

[Kristin laughing]
Yes! Thank you.

Oh my gosh! Thank you so much.

No, it's a... One second.


[laughing, chattering inaudibly]

And bonus, one, two.

Hike!


That wasn't too bad.
Now I'll do it again.

Hike!



<i>â™ª All I know it's a big old house

[Avery laughing] Wait for me.

These are both yours.
Oh, okay.


[both laughing]

This is not it.
[Will] The first half was good.

The first half was good.
It probably won't make the film.

Yes! I'm now in a dance musical movie.
I can't believe it.

[Avery laughing]

Do you want me to spit it out?
You should.

So unprofessional, Katherine.

Steady!

Steady! Camera operator!

I always am on the blob.
Yes, Sean. It's 'cause I love it.

That's not part of the script.
Might cut around it.


[squeals] Presley!
It was my best take!

Get inside!
That was my best take!

â™ª <i>...to my father's house</i> â™ª

Get inside! That was my Oscar!

Sean being a major creep, take one.

â™ª <i>With lots and lots of room</i> â™ª

I look terrible.
