Yes.
I’ll pick you up later.

Dear Mr. Norvo,

Regarding gaining access to your
properties in the Lower Quarter

during our expansion
of Southern Comm Cable

taxes on proposed payment...

Blah, blah, blah

Who among us can withstand
the wild pain of love’s demand?

It brings to us its blunt decree.
Leave deceit or leave with me.

And we who listen,
what do we say?

Do we say yes or run away?

I cut myself.

Blood of the fox for the hunt.

Tatta awake yet?

I don’t know.

Everything’s backward.

I was away from her as a child
and now I’m with her as an adult.

You know, she talks like
she’d brought you up.

Didn’t you miss her when
you were away at school.

She had my best interests
at heart.

I was a good boy,

Till I meet you.

I don’t have time for this.

See you after the beating
of the bachelor drums.

Don’t try to leave town,
Mrs. Martin.

We’re watching you.

Hey, baby, whatcha know?

Not much.

No? Stay outta trouble now.

Just like you.

Yeah, baby, just like me.

Remember, nothing’s as good as they
say it is! Nothing! Not even me!

Although I can do something awful
pretty good.

Tell me what you want for this.

Grab the balls!
Grab the balls!

Grab the balls!
Grab the balls!

Now, he’s just being virtuous.

In a couple of years he’s
gonna be begging for it.

I am getting married in France.

What the fuck does that mean?
I got married in Cleveland.

I’m telling you guys,
and understand this.

What happens is I just love
Carol Lisa.

This man is obviously very confused
about love,

the state of holy matrimony
and the purpose of this party.

Hey, Manny don’t forget
you’re a vegetarian now.

<i>Hey, Johnny!</i>

Johnny, how you doin’? Thanks
for comin’, man, thank you.

I don’t believe it.
Johnny Collins.

Thierry?

You got the power tie.

Asshole.

I hear you’re married and teach
at UNO, tell me it isn’t true.

Well, I was teaching
and I am married.

<i> Good morning lady </i>

The boy always had sweet teeth.

This is first-class accomodations

This one’s mine.
No, no.

Nothing about you changed?
Oh, yes!

I’m not gonna do anything to you.
A little of decore.

All right.

She still has her hearing.
All right, okay?

Tatta?

I’m here!

Go hide.
Go hide.

Tatta.

You’ll never guess who’s employed
at the mighty Southern Comm

under me.

It’s nice to see you so happy.

So, you’re his wife, are you?

Yes.

Who are you?

I’m Johnny Collins.

One hint.

We grew up in Baton Rouge
together, same street, same age.

I’m an old friend.

Thank you.

Okay, Mrs. Martin.

Okay, what?

Just okay.

Now we know who the other is.

You know, you have a very
peculiar notion about introductions.

Johnny Collins?
Johnny?

John Paul Gregory Collins.
the Third.

I was afraid it was you.
Tatta.

Under my very nose
for the last year,

only now does he make
his presence known.

That’s Thierry’s great grandfather.

His eloquence was God’s
and it flowed through him like

divine lighting.

Impressive looking man.

Do they still have a poet laureate?

Archaic, isn’t.

Actually the state is looking
for someone right now.

I deeply appreciate your confidence
in me,

but my balladeer days, alas,
are over.

My pen belongs to Southern Comm.

Well, I’m going to let the three
of you put the moon into bed.

Tatta.

Good night.
Good night.

So, how’s your dad?

My father passed.

He had a heart attack
about a year ago.

I’m sorry.

Yeah.

Thierry and I were misfits together.

Artists in exile

Did you ever graduate?

He never even attended.

He faked the whole thing,
took the tuition money,

rented a studio, bought canvases
and painted.

Only old big daddy found out,
didn’t he?

Yeah, the judge was not amused.

He cut me off until I came
to my senses.

But if I can’t paint,
everything just turns to shit.

What if you don’t sell?
I can’t worry about that, man.

That’s denying what I call
the artist’s life.

I think money’s an excuse
for a lack of art, anyway.

I don’t care who you are,
Donald Trump, who the hell,

without...

creativity

without...
life,

and you are truly unable to go
straight up the devil’s ass.

Lookin’ right in the face,

smile

and survive.

Passion.

Hey, Thier, I make no excuses
for what I do.

Yeah.

You have your models.

Do you have that?
Always have that.

Weel, that’s quite the situation

to have women come over
and take their clothes off for you.

Yes, it is, when that big red snatcer’s
comin’ right up against your face,

like a freight train it’s pretty hard
to paint and I’ll tell you what.

You always felt you had to tell them
the story of your life to fuck ’em.

It was a very short story.

But as a recall,

it was always my talkin’ that
got the girls to the barn.

I think I’d like to paint your portrait,
Thier.

Sure.

Put me behind my daddy’s desk
at Southern Comm

like some great father of industry?

No way, man.

No.

I’ll to it right here.

Are you serious?
Yeah.

All right.

Why not?

What do you think?

Fine by me.

Great.

Well, I better be goin’.

I gotta get up early in the a.m
and toil the line

now that I know who’s the boss.

Lovely.

<i> I really am sorry about your dad</i>

If it’s Southern Comm,

you don’t have to stay here.

Yes, I do.

Thierry, you can’t just shut out
what you are.

You can’t just decide to be your father
like that and become him.

I’m not trying to be him.

I’m just trying to get the company
back for him.

Goin’ after the balls first, too,
like Johnny.

He’s great one for spirit.

He troubled you, didn’t he?

You’ll get to liking him.

He grows on you.

So do worts.

<i> What is the Lord?</i>

<i> Where is He hiding and why
can’t I see Him inside?</i>

So I ask you: Are you tired
of searching for God?

Well, he’s not wearing Levi 501’s.

I love it.

I love it, Zandalee,
it’s adorable.

Where’d you find this, honey?

Now, if I go and find somebody
to take me.

I’m gonna get some looks
at the Sweetheart’s Ball.

Are you and Thierry goin’?

Mind fuckin’?
I’m sorry, I’, sorry.

Girl, you are getting’ seriously
lethargic, even for New Orleans.

I think it’s about time you get a little
pinch and bustle inside your bodice.

Hi.
Hi.

Well. I’m, gettin’ it, don’t worry.

Hi, how are you?
Fine.

Here it is, I’ve saved it for you.

And nobody else has seen it.

I think these colours could be
perfect for you.

What do you think?

Look at these buttons,
they’re like Persian cat eyes.

Take your time, honey,
make a meal out of it.

Come back to the dressing room.

Are you wearin’ that
to the Sweetheart’s Ball?

And don’t you be tellin’ everybody.

Back in the back.

Come here, you.

If you’ gettin’ it,
it’s not enough.

Would you stop worrying about me?

But I do worry about you.
I mean, girl,

if you look like you’re about to come
out of some jacket with pearl buttons.

I don’t know about you
but I think it’s time for you

to take a serious excursion
with me sometime real soon.

I’m gonna be the belle
of my sweetheart’s balls.

You’re disgusting.
And you love me for it.

Forget it, I am your reality check.

Johnny, do you want me
to shut the fun off?

No, I like it.

I like predictable tensions.

It’s buggin’ me, all right,
I can’t think.

Can you just try to stay seated?

It’s ironic you ending up with me
as your boss.

What are you planning on doing
with all the poetry, boss?

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean in that way.

I mean, nothing’s the way I thought
it would be.

The girls.

Make groceries, huh?

I love it.

Is he doing me justice?

You were always talented.

Eat a cookie.

Be kind.

Zan, come on in here.

I’m gonna fix chicken.

Espanian, like in the old days.

Ole.

Do you like it?

It’s to soon to tell.

Don’t mind her, she never critiques
till you’re finished.

Pain in the ass.

Your arms are around me
but your so far way.

Sorry.

I haven’t seen this for awhile.

The awkward sentiments
of a protracted adolescence.

You were good.

Shit.

Come on, your standards
are so high, they’re cruel.

No, they’re not.

It’s too easy.

Since when did the Martin legacy
become so important to you?

January twelfth of last year.

Your father’s dying isn’t the issue
anyway.

You just made it one
to quit writing.

Oh, is that so?

Do you remember when
we used to live on St. Charles

and you’d come home from classes,
Professor Martin?

I’d close the shop and we’d make
love all afternoon?

Lost a lot of business.

We were happy.
Do you think I’ve just quit?

I didn’t just quit.

What do you want me to do
with him?

Sit on the porch by the river
and try to write.

I think we have a problem?

Norvo agreed to everything.

Well, there quite a dollar
discrepancy

in the figures to be paid out.

There aren’t any discrepancies.

Well, the figure we agreed upon was
four thousand nine hundred dollars.

There are never discrepancies.

Richard Norvo was a slum lord.

Richard Norvo is an owner
of property

and a friend of Councilman Lweis.

Shit, man.

We’re talking about fifty
thousand dollars here.

Go with the decimal, Thierry.

At twenty-five my father started
a radio station.

At thirty he was a millionaire
owing his own radio network

with his morality intact.

Your father didn’t keep up
with the times.

We’ve been bought out, Thierry.

Now, it’s up to you to be
diplomatic

if you wanna preserve what’s left
of your father’s company.

I’ll set a lunch for you
with Norvo tomorrow.

Shake it up!
It ain’t much of a hold!

An undelayed miracle of movement!

<i> Here you go, ladies, two more
Puss ‘n’ Boots.</i>

Thank you, Buckles.

This one’s my personal favorite.

Guess were I was this morning.

In the chapel.

Well, say two Hail Mary’s, honey,
call me in the morning.

Girl, you better check his donor
card if you’re gonna do that.

Wonderful feet.

I didn’t mean to wake you.

Somebody has a good time.

Certainly did.

Some strange and wonderful secrets
on Bourbon Street this evening.

Bourbon Street?
Yes, Bourbon Street.

God.

You would have figured.
Not me.

Can you help me, please,
I’m...

Help me.

I want you like we used to want.

Tell me, tell me to say your name.

Say it, Zandalee, say it.

Harder, harder.
Don’t you want me?

Say it.
Say my name.

Thierry.

Thierry.

Thierry.

Go on!

Do it!

Jesus!

All right.

All right, I just thought we’d try it,
that’s all.

You know, be explorers.

You have to make a place for us
in your life.

Please.

I want to.

Is it me? ‘Cause I want you to tell me.
God, it was nothing to do with you.

I’m just paralyzed

A paraplegic of the soul.

There you go, a metaphor
for old times’ sake.

Zandalee, please, I can’t deal
with this.

Do you know what?

I wish you were a paraplegic because
at least I could understand then.

What?

A lizard.

Come here.

Hey, babe, I sell it to you for five
bucks, a bit, twenty-five cents.

It’s a deal.

It’s a steal.

Okay, you got me.
All right, all right.

That’s pretty funny.

<i> I gave in</i?</i>

You think so?

He got caught.

Don’t wanna be caught,
Shouldn’t be a thief.

<i> I got it from my mother,
I swear to that.</i>

What’s that?

<i> You can stake my life on that man,
all right?</i>

The black rose of fate.

I got a broken heart, man,
I need an operation.

Want one?

Zandalee.

We’re gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

So?

<i> That’s all enough?</i>

Whatta you think?
Any good?

I take it’s quit a bold
interpretation.

It’s an understatement.

I think it’s impossible to record
anything today as a fact

without causing some injury
to the image.

I’ll try it in the bedroom.

I’ll have some champagne.

What do you think?

No doubts that isn’t
your talents.

I remember the last time I saw
your father, God rests his soul.

Heard you were lookin’
for an apartment in the Quarter.

I offered him a gorgeous one,
it was on Royal Street, third floor.

The last tenants had completely
renovated it.

I preferred to find my own apartment.

Thank you.

Well.

If you’re ever...looking,

come see me, I’ll cut you
a good deal.

Thank you, but we’re quite
happy were we are.

I share your sensibilities,

but you’re on the move now,
Vice President Martin.

Time you come over to the house,
have dinner, meet the family.

Better yet, come spend the weekend
at the camp in Mississippi.

You a huntin’ man?

Where you at, darlin’?
You got somethin’ for me?

I thank you.

Spare a quarter for an old
altar boy, baby.

No.

No?

Get away.

Why?

Do I have to spell this out for you?

No

The go lay off on someone else.

I’m not like that.

And you shouldn’t cast aspersions
on people you don’t know.

We’re inevitable.

I wanna shake you naked
and eat you alive, Zandalee.

Don’t say my name.

Johnny.

Nobody will be heart from it

because It is what it is.

It is what it is.

Just as simple as that.

You want it

and I wanna give it.

Perfectly relationship.

That’s not a relationship.

Zandalee.

Zandalee.

Do you know what I like?

I like it when you don’t wear
anything under.

What are you thinking?

You’re an insecure sad woman.

I am not.

It’s pretty hard to hide
the clairvoyance of the eyes.

He’s not a bad man.

<i>Hey, it’s Pepe.</i>

<i>You meet me tomorrow at the Five
Deuces six o’clock.</i>

<i>Don’t be late, bring cash and
I’ll have what you want.</i>

I can see you’ve been
staying up nights.

I understand.

I have needs, too.

Although...

though my husband has been gone

for many years.

And?

Well?

there has been someone and...

then there is someone.

Really?

And, he’s now moved to New Orleans
you know, to be with me.

In fact, we’ve always lived
close to one another.

I would love it, if he would
come here,

but it’s, you know, difficult.

I think maybe we better
have your friend over for dinner.

Father, pick a card.

Okay.
Right.

Is that your card?

Yeah.

Man, how’d you do that?

That’s my secret.

I need another shoot.

Why is it that the Baptists get
the woman but no booze

and the Catholics get the booze
and no women?

You know, Pepe was lookin’ for you
a while ago

and he left a little something’ for you.

He said you short poured him
a bunch o’ C notes on the last round.

There’s not a worry in the world.

You’re just gonna have to float me
on the bar tab.

Unless the good Lord
takes care of me.

Johnny, Johnny.

This is about the only economy
left in the town.

Maybe it’s the only one
you allow yourself to see.

Father, you don’t really need
your parish down here.

I’ve been lookin’ for you.

Seems like everybody’s
lookin’ for me today.

And what’ll you have?
I’ll have what he has.

So, whatta you wanna see
me about?

Don’t look so concerned.

I’m not, I just get nervous when,
people say they’re lookin’ for me.

Well, rest easy,

the only paper I’m servin’
is an invitation to dine.

I have plans.

Bring her along.

Look, just come, I need you there.

We’re meeting Tatta’s
secret boyfriend.

Really?

Really.

For all of ‘em.

Thanks, boss.

This duck is really succulent.

Why a duck? Why not
a turkey or a chicken?

The Marx Brothers, didn’t you get it?

Yeah, I got it.

Yeah.

Were you named after
the cognac, Remy?

Not Remy, Ray-me.

Ah, Ray-me!

Thierry.

I’m really didn’t wanna have to bring
this up, it’s such a lovely dinner,

but,

I think I have to tell you

that you married the wrong girl,
Thierry.

How, so?

Because if you’d married Remy,

the she’d be Remy Martin.

That’s reallly cute.

I thought so.

To Tatta and Louie.

Eternal happiness in life’s
great mistery.

Thank you.

Mr. Medina,

are you intending to make
Tatta honorable?

But it is not the ring that gives
soul to honor,

it is heart.

An unswerving heart.

It maybe just a touch, maybe
just a touch of sin

that will give us this “joie de vivre”.

My dear grandmamma,

go and do as the natives do.

Be careful what you say,

you just might give people here
a license to rise sensuousness.

Right in that ear right there.

I’ll go prepare the dessert.

Back in the old New Orleans’
red light district,

Countess Willie Piazza, madame
of a ritzi “maison de plasir”,

was famous for an exotic dessert.

Cherries jubilee?

Do tell, Tatta.

No!

Imagine fresh cherries boiled
in cream

sweetened with absinthe.

Served stuffed inside the privates
of the ruling quadroon beauty.

Is that what Zan’s up to?

I didn’t teach you that.

You don’t remember.

I know you want dessert,
Zandalee.

Don’t bring your girl friends
into my house.

I’m not some dumb coon-ass
you can mess with.

Understand?

Fine.

You be whatever you wanna be,

but I know what you really are.

And what is that?

Nothing but a dumb coon-ass prick.

<i>Really?</i>

Then take me.

Take my dumb coon-ass prick
inside of you

with your husband in the next room.

Can you do that?

Yes.

<i>Hey, Johnny, come save me from
the horrible stories they’re telling.</i>

I’ll be there in a minute.

<i>Just washing up.</i>

<i>And he kills bums, people
that nobody cares about.</i>

<i>That’s horrible.</i>

<i>Some people escape God’s eye.</i>

<i>Conscience is the sole arbiter
of the individual</i>

<i>Without it...</i>

What’ve you done to your hair?

I’m just experimenting.

It’s unsettling.

It doesn’t become you.

So, where is Louie?

He likes to linger in the morning.

I’ve recognized him.

He was always on the periphery.

Holidays, straight week-ends,

except of course when I was back
at school.

He’s why you came here.

Thierry, I came because of you.

And Louie came because of me.

Those are such simple rules of love
between people.

Can’t you accept that?

I mean, it’s between you and me.

It’s between you and Zan.

And it’s between me and Louie.

And your husband?
Where was he?

I don’t regret anything.

Why?

Why what?
Why did you do it?

Why’d I do what?

Why’d you marry him?

He was a poet.

He was pretty good, too.

And what about this?

Isn’t this poetry?

I don’t know.

I don’t know.

Zan!

Zan.

No.

This is your game, Zan.

No.

Yes.

Thierry.

What did you say?

Fuck me.

All the time.
Anyway you want.

He’s my husband.

And I wanna hump here.

Say my name.

Say my name.

You can say it.

Johnny.

I can’t do this anymore.

I can’t be what you want me
to be.

Yes, you can.

It’s not me.

You can be what I want
you to be.

You just have to relax.

When I’m inside you

I feel lost at the edge of the universe.

Travelling, exploring.

Roll over on your stomach.

I won’t do drugs.
I’m not asking you to.

Where else can you express
this need to free our bodies?

And we’ll fuck like animals.

In the altar of the primal.

Look, all I got is twenty bucks, okay?

I’ll give you a good deal.
All right?

Sit down.

Come on, give me the money.

Can’t you do this someplace else?

<i>- It’s a free country.
-Do you want me to call the cops?</i>

I’ve already called them.
Come on.

Calm down.

Come on.
Get!

And don’t come back here!
Nice slip, asshole.

Jesus!

The Quarter is a pit.

Now, Zandalee, honey, don’t go
blaming it on the Quarter.

When everybody’s always
raggin’ on the Quarter.

It’s not just the Quarter, honey,
it’s everyware.

Thank you, Scarlet.
Well, it’s true.

I’ll tell you a little ‘once upon a time’
story.

I had an uncle Arthur.

He had a wonderful job,
sold it to the highest bidder.

And, honey, he was sheriff.

You can sell anything in this country.

Anything.

Would you please tell Tatta
I’m going to lunch?

And I’m not invited?

All right, I’ll cover your little liaison.

It takes the pressure off.

You keep sayin’ that, honey.

<i>Johnny, where you been?</i>

<i>I’m praying for you, why don’t you
call me sometime</i>

Hey, Bro, what are you at?

Did you get canned?

Promoted.

How do you get promoted
when you’re already the boss?

Well, I’m not the boss.

It’s not my father’s company
anymore.

Congratulations.

Yes, congratulations.

You’re turning out to be real
executive dude.

Look, I’m on lunch break.
Yes, I know.

I took care of it.

Take a seat.

Thanks.

Do you wanna share my peach?
No, thanks.

<i>Mr. Allen, pick up line three,
I’m serious.</i>

Seems you’ve been taking
some awfully long lunches.

Yeah, I had personal business.
Yes.

I’ve imagined.

I’ve been savin’ you
from getting fired.

Should I?

I don’t need saving, Thier.

Are we through here?

Do you have somewhere to go?

Just back to work

You have a mistress, don’t you?

I’m not married.

I understand.

You understand?

If you compromise your honor
you lose everything

and God help you then.

Congratulations on your promotion.

<i>Sweetcakes, it’s your Remy.</i>

<i>Sweetheart, are you there?</i>

<i>Pick up</i>

<i>Johnny</i>

<i>Johnn...</i>

<i>When you’re smiling,</i>

<i>when you’re smiling,</i>

<i>the whole world smiles with you.</i>

<i>When you’re laughing,</i>

<i>when you’re laughing,</i>

<i>the sun comes shining through.</i>

<i>But when you’re crying,</i>

<i>you just bring on the rain.</i>

<i>So stop your crying</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Be happy again.</i>

<When you’re smiling...

I didn’t stand you up.

Somebody at work got ahold on me.

How’d you find me?

How’d I find you?

I know everything about you.

Come here.

Don’t.

Don’t do that here.

I want you to move in with me.

No.

It’d kill him.

Let me tell you somethin’
about people.

People die and people die.

Everybody dies,

so, leave him.

Don’t talk like that.

Why don’t you think of
where you are?

God can hear us better in here, huh?
Yeah?

Well, fuck!

Shit.

Strike me down, Lord, because
if you can’t fuckin’ leave him,

I’ll make you fuckin’ leave him!

Shut up! Shut up!
Come here!

Aren’t we the real church?

Isn’t this the way He really
shows Himself to us?

Isn’t it?

With this...

true miracle,

this gift.

Thank you, Father.

I freed you.

You know that.

Okay.
Okay, okay.

Zan!

Hey, you!
Where are you going?

Come on, Tatta.

Wait a moment.
Okay.

I couldn’t guess it.

Hi, Zandalee.

Hello, Zan.

Oh, no! The same.

I don’t know what to do to win.

Do you wanna play with us?

No, thank you.

I’ll be right back.

You know, Zan.

Most marriages suffer,

but the good ones conquer.

Not without a fight, though.

Don’t be afraid.

The longer you look at the problems
the bigger they get.

That’s true for the solutions, too.

Just go to him.

He is your husband.

Talk to him.

Make him talk to you.

We really have to talk.

All right.

Let’s be civilized.

Hello.

Hello.

I just need you to know...
No!

I don’t want to know.

All I know is I don’t want to know
anything.

I don’t.

Christ!
Thierry.

I thought I...
Goddamnit!

I can give you absolution!

I’m not your confessor!

I tried to quit Southern Comm.

Good.

Good?

I couldn’t quit.

But it’ll free you.

Like you.

<i>Western wind,
when will thou blow?</i>

<i>The small rain down can rain.</i>

<i>Christ that my love were
in my arms</i>

<i>and I’m in my bed again.</i>

Remember that?

We don’t know how to talk.

We don’t know how to fuck.

I’m sorry.

I’m sorry too.

But sorry’s gonne get us but a pool
of tears and a box of Kleenex.

Let’s just go away for awhile
just the two of us.

Leave everything behind.

Start clean.

Johnny, how you doin’, man?
All right.

How’s the art comin’?
Well, I haven’t had much time.

I hear you show sold out?

Yeah, big bucks in the Big Apple.

Listen, let me give you my card,
then you can give me a call,

and I’ll give you the scoop,
you know, just like old times.

All right.
You look good, man.

I told him I’d give him ten dollars to
come over to my yard with his horse

and fertilize my flowers.

Skunk.

You’re drunk as a skunk.

Mr. Collins.

Did Pepe leave anything for me?
He say you owe him blind.

You know him, he’s always
shootin’ off.

We worked out a friend schedule,
it’s okay.

I don’t want trouble
around here tonight,

I’m thinkin’ maybe you oughta
leave off the stuff for a while.

Well, he gave me this, didn’t he?
Yeah.

So, where’s your wife tonight?

Runnin’ around.

She took a lover.

I think so.

Christ, Thierry, what’s
the world comin’ to?

No, no, we’re gonna work it out.

Starting tomorrow a new contract.

My forgiveness, her absolution.

Goin’ to the Bayou and there
it’ll begin.

Bayou Tesche?

Goin’ to the old spot we used to fish?

<i>Exactly.</i>

Where else in there to go
on earth?

Jack, hit me for the road, my friend.

And judgin’ by your size
I mean figuratively speakin’ to us.

A gentlemen politely holds his say
in polite company

except when honor is a stake,

and then it’s to the proverbial
duellin’ oak.

Honor.

Honor.
Who cares?

Lies and manipulation,

these are the duellin’ blades
of the day, Jack.

Do you know who this guy is?

Johnny.

For all I know, it could be you.

You know, I should despise
this lover of hers,

but I don’t.

I should despise myself

for bein’ grateful to him
for satisfyin’ my Zan.

But I don’t.

This has nothin’ to do with Zan.

You’re lost.

Lost and found.
Lost and found.

I know what I’m doin’.

<i>Good bye, Johnny.</i>

I can’t stand up, I’ll fall down.

Drank like a king
now I’m sick as a dog.

Yep, that’s a pretty nauseating
way for us to start clean.

Don’t make me laugh.
Damn!

Why?
It hurts when you laugh?

Worse.

Looks like you need St. Soda Pop
real quick.

That was mean.

I don’t know why I do these things.

I guess I’m still just white trash.

You were born a century too late.

I’m outta step and I don’t fit in.

My biggest problem, however,
seems to be I don’t care to.

We’re gonna be okay.

God, you’re beautiful.

Just let me look.

See?

All the parts work.

I don’t wanna disturb you, baby,
would you tie us off?

I’ll wait here.

And you’re hot.

Hold at that.

<i>It’s out of order again</i>

<i>- Bonjour
Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

Nice sparkle beetles.

I’m after catfish.

I got some fresh done stink bait, but
you can’t cook with your wife at home.

You gonna go for catfish,
you got to use chicken blood.

Chicken blood’ll get you a cat.

Hello.

Where you at, Bro?

What took you so long?

Guess you knew you made
me jealous and longing

with all you talk about Bayou.

Zan’s right outside.

Sure I won’t be imposing?

There’s time for everything.

Look at the stray I’ve found.

Let’s take a turn.

Let’s show her how it is done.

Come on.

You remember?

Who wants a beer?
I’ll take one.

Come and get it then.

I’ll bring it to you all right.

I came to take you home.

It’s over.

You don’t love him.

If you would leave me alone,
I would forever.

Thierry?

Thierry.

Thierry, you can really fucking
going coon-ass, man.

You come to the back woods and
the back woods they come to you.

It’s over.

Who’s for some fishin’?

Mr. Christian?

Hey.

Isn’t our old spot the other way?

No, no, no, this way, farther up.

Who cares about your old spot?
Let’s just get somewhere.

Out, out, damn spot.

Who would have thought the old man
could have so much blood in him?

Why don’t you let me take over
for a minute?

Jesus Christ!
Watch out!

Gunboat Collin’s back.

We used to do this as kids.

Slow down!

What for?
This is what it’s all about.

Somebody’s gonna get hurt.

Faster!

Where’s your blood, Zan?

Faster!

Get that fucker!

What’s gotten into you?
Snakes!

Thierry!

Thierry!

You and I are gonna settle
something.

Right.

We’re gonna settle it now!

He’s caught in the hyacinth!

Thierry!

Hey, you got any money?

How you doin’?

I’m not carrying any.

No? It’s all right.

Do you want some chicken
and biscuits?

No, I’m a vegetarian.

Shit, how you been?
You look terrible.

I killed my husband.

Is this his grave?

Yeah.

They say he drowned.

How can you drown
when you can swim?

Nah, some big did dude of yoren’s
done him gone with a knife

while you just laid back.

Am I right or right?

It’s like I always say, be careful
what you want, you might just get it.

I never wanted this.

Speak it once in the heart an amen,
hallelujah, it’s there.

That’s a religious heart-of-fact.

You don’t got a light, do you?

No.

I’m fine.

I’m fine.

I’m fine.

<i>I’m fine</i>

<i>Collins, your ass is shot.
Over and out.</i>

<i>Gotta make accounts
payable, man.</i>

<i>Pepe says as Pepe don’t jive.</i>

Ants.
I detest them.

If only one of them could pick up
a needle and sew.

I think we need to poison
the intruders.

Yeah, I better go to the market.

I’ll go honey.
No.

I’ll get it.

Line me up.
Tequila.

Three.

Man, you oughta lay off this stuff.

Nice to see you, too.

Those faggots fired me.

Hell, you been showin’ up?

Screw that cable shit anyhow.

Take you a vacation somewhere.

Get away for me for a while,
you know what I mean?

I’m not worried, I don’t care
the things happen for a reason.

I gotta be painting.

Painting.

Where’s the bottle.

Do you dig it, Rog?
Do you dig it?

It’s all right.

Has a sense of action to it,
don’t you think?

I really captured brutality,
in fact, here.

I feel good about it.
And I didn’t use drugs.

This is excellent.

This is really the best one, to me
you really broke free on this one.

That’s an old one.

But it’s really good direction
that you’re heading in.

As far as I am concerned
you could be fucking dead!

You made a mistake. It’s a Picasso!
That’s it. So get the fuck outta here!

<i>- Do you wanna a cup of coffe?
No.</i>

Just call me when you get
Some new work.

Yeah, okay.
Take it easy.

Damn!

Die!

Die! Die!
Fuckin’ die!

Die! Die!

Just die!

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Black it out! Black it out!
Black it out!

Black it out!
Black it out!

The door was open.

I’ve been havin’...

a kind of a strange time.

I’m sick,

disgusted.

I tried saving him, but he didn’t
wanna be saved.

He wanted to be let go.

You wanted it.

Not just me.

When I go in my kitchen
to make toast

I smell your skin.

I can’t get you out of me.

You don’t know anything
about love.

Zan.

How can you know anything
about it?

I’ll never be rid of you.

Thierry.

Johnny!

Johnny!

No.

No!

No!

You gotta make accounts
payable, man.
