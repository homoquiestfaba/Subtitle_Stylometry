Colma stays out of place

While I take the train to a space

I can leave my worries
far behind me

If for only eight hours a day

I trace the lines I find upon me

Find my way to Serramonte

I can't believe

How much it hasn't changed

It goes to show

that Colma stays

And Colma stays

Colma stays

The rest move forward

I can't tell

What I move toward

I can't see the changes

Everybody swears

Are happening before my face

I trace the lines on the floor

Find my way back to Westmoor

I still see the teachers

That I sat before

And hated even then

'Cause Colma stays

New York just cleaned up
Times Square

And San Francisco
is right over there

Los Angeles just instated

A new mode of public transit

While Colma stays

I guess it's cool we got
a new police station

Next to the police station

Colma stays

Far from disaster

Safe and slow

The people leave faster

Wish I had a car

'Cause where you are
ain't very far

Where Colma stays

I trace the roots undefined

Oh, my God

They're tearing down Lyon's

Who says that there's no progression
here in Colma?

Can't they see the signs?

<i>Westlake Shopping Center</i>
<i>just got a Boston Market.</i>

<i>They built a multiplex next to the Toto's.</i>

<i>Shakey's is now IHOP.</i>

Colma stays next to Daly City

Object of ridicule and pity

New York's got New Jersey

San Francisco's got the place

Where Colma stays

I trace the roots of my sadness

Find my way into
the mouth of madness

Maybe there's a reason why

The world goes on and on

While Colma stays

And Colma stays

London's got a bustling scene

And Amsterdam's different
standards of a scene

Paris got the Louvre and Eiffel Tower

To mark its land

While Colma stays

We finally got an In-N-Out Burger

Next to a Krispy Kreme

Maybe it's a different way of living

But it's just the way

I've lived for so long

How can you say

That I'm missing out?

Colma stays

The place I was born

Wanting, sad, forsaken, forlorn

Still I wouldn't give it up

For anybody

I know nothing more

You hear the tone of my voice

Still you think
that I have a choice

What more can a girl
from Colma do

Than just accept

That Colma stays?

And Colma stays

Everybody has their call

And everyone in Colma
ends up at the mall

Maybe there's a reason why

The world will never know

Where Colma stays

Colma stays

Colma stays

And you will never know

Colma stays

Fast as a tortoise

Colma stays

Like rigor mortis

Colma stays

As popular as Tae-bo

Colma stays

But I have to go

Oh, Kevin will see you soon.

Go ahead and have a seat.

Okay.

Billy?
Yeah, that's me.

Nice tie.

Billy. Billy Castillo.

Castillo.

It's Spanish.
Castillo, right.

That whole double "L" thing?

Never made much sense to me.

So you just graduated
from high school.

Uh, yeah, last week.

How's it feel to you?

Uh, it's... it's new.

I mean, I've been waiting
for it for such a long time.

Now that it's actually here,

it just feels like
any other day, I guess.

I always thought that I'd
have all the answers

by the time I was 18,

and, you know, now that I'm 18,

I don't really feel any wiser.

It's just part of the big journey, I guess, right?

I drew those nipples huge.

So, yeah, big journey
and whatnot.

Are you going to college right away?

In August.

That's not too far away.

No.

Uh, but I can schedule
my classes around work.

So it says here that...

Where'd your tie go?

It's in my hand.

Why is it in your hand?

I just... You know, I thought that...

It's okay, leave it off. Leave it off.

Yeah, it was an ugly tie anyway.

I know, right?

So it says here that you were part of
Thespian Troupe 2665?

Yeah.

Thespian.

Yeah, we had a bumper sticker
that said "Thespians do it on stage."

Now, that's just juvenile.

I always thought so.

You had a paper route
before this?

Uh, yeah.

And you want to work here?
Yeah.

Sell me this shirt.

Okay.

Hello. Do you have any questions
about this shirt?

Oh, hello.

I was wondering if you could tell me
something about this shirt.

Uh, I'd be glad to.

What was your question?

Actually, I have quite a few, sonny.

Do you have this in a Medium?

Actually, sir, this is...

I am a woman. Don't call me sir!

Excuse me, ma'am.

Uh, I think this is a Medium.

I see.

You see, I have a tendency to put on weight,

and I was wondering
if it would shrink on me.

I'd say,

I think if you're careful...

You still live with your parents, huh?

Yeah.

You don't do your own laundry?
No.

It says that it's
prewashed and preshrunk.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about the things you don't know.

That's what training is for.

Do you know how many fucking
mongoloids I've hired here?

I had a paper route

And I think that maybe

I was happy

I had it figured out

I knew someday

That I would be happy

All along, I didn't know
what it meant

To have it figured out

Just as long as I said

Things will get better
than a paper route

I used to go to school

And I think that maybe

I was happy

I know I wasn't cool

I knew someday

That I would be happy

But I couldn't envision
the future enough

To scare the dither away

Just as long as I said

Things will get better

It will be okay

So how'd it go?
I got it.

You got it?

You got the job?

That's good.
Yeah.

Congratulations, Billy.

When we get home,
we'll order a pizza.

No, just drop me off at Ro's house.

But... we're gonna order a pizza.

It's not that big a deal.
Just drop me off at Ro's house.

So... you think you're so cool
now that you're 18 years old.

You know what?
When I was your age,

I was 18, and I didn't know shit.
Julio.

Jesus, he's 18 years old.

You don't think the motherfucker
swears himself?

Things'll get better

Oh, hi, Mr. Valode. Is Ro home?

I don't know.

Rodel!
What?

Billy's here for you.

Tell him to come up!

I got the job.

Yeah?
Yeah!

Holy shit, man.
I get fired from my job,

and you get a job doing
the exact same thing.

You take my title of retail bitch.

That's right, a retail bitch
for all those consumer whores.

Well, Maribel's supposed
to be inviting us

to something later on,
and I don't know what...

We should celebrate.
Nice, what are we gonna do?

She says there's
this cool party tonight.

Oh, someone else's party.
Hey, you might like it.

There's supposed to be
a lot of girls there tonight.

That is the last thing I should be
thinking about right now.

School was such a joke

And I'm glad to be gone
I was happy

Now I'm poor and broke

But I have to move on
I'll be happy

I used to think that when I graduated

Things would blur a little less

I told myself that
things will get better

Than this whole amorphous mess

It will be okay

Things will get better

It will be okay

Things will get better

Hey, Billy, it's Maribel. I'm just calling
to see where you guys are at, and...

Oh, you're right in front of my house
and walking up to me right now,

so I'm gonna hang up.

Which one of us were you calling?
I called both of you.

I just left a message on your voice mail.
Yeah, we were singing.

We all gonna go to the party
at Chester House?

What the hell is Chester House?

Chester House!
You know, it's that house

where all those college kids
throw those random parties,

like the Super Bowl party
or the white trash party.

You mean there's a difference?

Yeah.

I just wish I had the structure

That I had two weeks ago

I have so many questions

One of them being

Do I look fuckable?

I'd switch for you.

We need to lighten up, up
And I'm glad to be gone

Something to swivel us

I was happy
Something frivolous

You need to have some fun
Now I'm poor and broke

And I have to move on
Get some drinks in us

Maybe some cannabis

Maybe you just need to pull

That stick out of your ass

Things have piled
to shit right now

But still this, too, will pass

No one told us that

The future feels about the same

No one told us that this party

Would look so fucking lame

It will be okay

Things will get better

So why do they call it Chester House?

Well, these college kids
wanted to stay near the college,

but the cheapest house they could rent
was in Westchester Square.

So they called it
Westchester House.

But after a while
it just became Chester House.

Hmm. Chester House. That's cool.
Isn't it?

No.
No.

Look, can you guys
act normal for one night?

Normal.
Act.

Just try and have
a good time tonight.

Please?

For me?

"For me?"
Come on.

21-year-old appeal

I can't believe how young I feel

And it

Makes me feel I'm cool as shit

All the nonconformists gather 'round

To show off, wax and blather wit

Everybody's cool as shit

Hey, what's up!

Hey! Show us a magic trick!

And no one knows
how young we are

We're all on the same page

No one knows how young we are

That we are underage

Come on! Let's do a shot!

None for me.

More for us.

Crash the party

And they'll never know

We're rockin' slow and steady

Act the part

And they will never know

I'm feeling cool already

Crash the party

And they will never know

There goes Amanda.

Remember, guys, act the part.

How the hell do you act 21?

Hey, Maribel, you made it!

Hi, Amanda! Awesome party.

Yeah, another college party, right?

Anyway, what's up, biatch?
Nothing.

Oh, I just brought my friends along.

This is Billy, and this is Rodel.

Right. So anyway,

there's beer in the bathtub,

and mixin's in the kitchen.

All of my roommates
are on the roof

testing out this red-haired sinsemilla.

On the roof, huh?

Well, I guess
they really wanted to...

get high.

I'm 21.
Right.

Maribel, come give me a hug, nigga.

Oh, my God, I said nigga.

That's such a Maribel thing to say.

It is?
Oh, Maribel, you are too cute.

She would have gotten the joke

if she weren't so stupid.
No, you're right.

The joke works on exactly two levels.

Come on.

Let's go check out
the mixin's in the kitchen.

Maybe I'm not cool enough

To understand this hipster stuff

Just yet

But there's one thing I don't get

I love you so much, man!

I don't know what
I'm doing with my life!

Is that what we're gonna be when we grow up?

What, Loud?

You see, that's great

Obnoxious seems to be my fate

As long as he says random things

With funny faces to make

Everything his random thing

There's only so much I can take

Well, I think he rocks.

In that sucky way.

Let's do a shot.

Crash the party

And they'll never know

We're rockin' slow and steady

Act the part

And they will never know

I'm feeling cool already

Crash the party

And they will never know

This party really fucking blows

I can't believe you.
What?

Did you guys come to this party
just to criticize it?

No, we came to the party
'cause we thought

it would be a great way
to celebrate the fact

that Billy got the job today.

Oh, my God! Billy, that's awesome!

Congratulations! Why didn't you guys tell me?

Oh, we were gonna tell you,

but you looked really busy
dominating the conversation.

And we're not criticizing the party.

We're just...

You know, criticism
implies that we have

some sort of evaluation
process, and we don't.

This party just fuckin' sucks.

Yeah, whatever.
Rodel, grab me three cups.

Three cups for your alcoholic consumption
coming up.

Two cups. I'm not drinking.

You know, it was cooler when I
could call you a fag for not drinking.

Now you get to hide
behind the real cool term.

You're straight-edged.

Where's the Kahlúa?
I want to make a Tootsie Roll.

Where's the Jack?
I want to make a Jack and Coke.

Where's the toilet? I want to make a stinky.

You're gonna shit in their toilet?

Yeah, I have to go.

Okay, we'll be here.

Crash the party

And they'll never know

We're rockin' slow and steady

Act the part

And they will never know

I'm feeling cool already

Crash the party

And they will never know

Is this the bathroom?

Yes, it is

You and me, let's do
a shot of straight Kahlúa

Is there someone in there?

I'm taking a shit

Or perhaps we feel
a shot of straight tequila

Maybe while I'm standing here

You could grab me
an ice-cold beer

Sure, give me a second.

Maribel, you're being beckoned.

You're sweating.

So are you.

You have paint on your face.

So do you.

No, I don't.

Oh. Well, I just came from rehearsal,

so I didn't have time to was the paint off.

You're in a play?

Yeah, I'm a thespian.

Awesome! I'm an actor.

I didn't think I'd meet an actress tonight.

Actually, I prefer to be called an actor.

Oh. Right. Right.

That whole "woman" thing.

That whole "woman" thing?

Sorry. I didn't mean...

It's okay.

I should go.

Can I get my beer?

Right! Sorry.

Wait.

Crash the party,
and they'll never know

Some things you can't rehearse it

Act the part, and they will never know

I'm such a stupid person

Crash the party,
and they're out the door

We're rockin' slow and steady

Act the part, and then we'll drink it all

I'm feeling cool already

Crash the party

And they will never know

Hey, there, stranger.
Hey.

I don't know about you guys,

but Mama's getting laid tonight.

By who?

I don't know. Somebody.

All the guys here have girlfriends.

Good. It means they won't
call me in the morning.

Wow. Is that what you're drinking

to make yourself more
attractive tonight?

It's what I'm drinking to make other people
more attractive tonight.

You don't stand a chance
of getting anybody here.

Just watch, Billy.

Rodel, all the guys here are straight.

Hey, how can you tell
if your roommate's gay?

How?

His dick tastes like shit.

That's really crass.

Oh, I love it.

I'm gonna write that down.

Do it.

You guys wanna see our reenactment

of Michael Madsen meeting Alex Baldwin
for the first time?

Yeah.

How you doing tonight?

How you doing tonight?

I hate Michael Madsen.

He played the father in <i>Free Willy.</i>

You know what?

The movie he was
in that was really good?

What?
Shut the fuck up.

Now, that was a good movie.

I'm Margaret Avery!

See, Daddy?
Sinners got soul, too.

I love this guy!

He's fuckin' off his nut!

You've seen <i>The Color Purple?</i>
What?

You've seen <i>The Color Purple.</i> Shug Avery.

No. I don't even know
who the fuck Margaret Avery is.

Something random and quirky!

I love this guy!

Everybody listen up.

I'm 21 years old.

Just like Maribel.

Just like Billy.

We were talking earlier about
how much we miss being 18,

because we're certainly
not 18 right now.

Right?

And we were talking about how we
used to sneak into college parties,

much like this one.

You know, you've all done it.

And I see all of you, us,

desperately clinging
on to our high school years

back when it was cool and subversive
to flip off the camera.

And we're all still a bunch
of geeks and losers, right?

Am I right?

I don't know about that.

So, when I see us acting
all hip and shit,

I can't help but think to myself

Could

We

Oh, no, he's singing.

Get any older?

Our youth is just slippin' away

We're tryin' real hard to act the part

I'm sure that we'll be cool someday

This one looks like he still
lives at home with mom

And this one took his best friend
as a date to the prom

And this one smells like feet

And really likes to eat

How could you not love this guy?

Rodel.
Could we get any older?

Get any older

I think that we can die right now

Underneath the cool facade,
we're still real odd

We're major fuckin' dorks, and how

This one looks like she needs
to wear a push-up bra

And this one goes
to the Renaissance Fair

You've got all
the <i>Buffy</i> episodes on DVD

Because you wished
you looked as skinny as her

Could we get any older?

I don't think so

You're hanging on to your youth

You act real cool
like you never ditched school

But everybody knows the truth

You throw parties every week
just to pass the time

And then everybody leaves
for you to clean up the grime

And then you're stuck at home

All alone

Wishing you could find a man

Could you get any lamer?

I'm sorry
if I'm sounding blunt

But if you can't hang
with what I just sang

You can shove it

Up

Your

Cunt

Just kidding! God, Take a joke!

Fucking lesbians!

I'll take it from here.

I'm real sorry, gentlemen. Nice party.

You know, I can walk, you know.

Just 'cause I'm drunk doesn't mean
that I can walk... or not walk.

Come on!

I am so sorry. He gets like this.

So you know he gets like this,

and you brought him
to my party anyway?

Well, at least he didn't kick anything.

One day, I'll find my happy place

Maybe one day then I'll find a person

Who can curl up in my arm

Come on, Billy, sing with me.

No, I'm tired. Get off the car.
I want to go home.

You know the words.
Sing harmony. 3, 4...

One day, I'll find my happy place

And maybe then I'll find...

I forgot the fucking words

I forgot the words, Billy.
What are the words?

Fucking words

Come on, sing harmony.

Yeah, I really want
to do this right now.

I know it lies somewhere
beyond the clouds

And oh, dude, where
my heart is stopping

I don't care, I know that I'll be there

One step at a time, yeah

I'll climb to the highest point

I know that if I try
Harmony!

I'll fly

So high you won't believe
what I can do

Kick!

It's true

My happy place
is waiting in the sky

And I can meet you there...

Woman, you fucked up my song.

I had fun tonight.

Billy, I'm drunk, and I'm pissed.

You know, if we were
in Britain right now,

you would have
sounded so redundant.

Oh, my God, Rodel!

It was one thing for you to get drunk

and start snapping
at people at the party,

but then you get all karaoke
on everyone with my car alarm?

That was the fun part.

And you. You're sober,
and you encouraged him!

Sorry, Maribel. We didn't mean
to mess up your night.

We meant to mess up our own.

We keep forgetting that everything
revolves around you.

What?

Maribel, he's drunk.
It's the alcohol talking.

You're a fuckin' bitch Maribel.

Jesus, Ro!

That's the alcohol talking, too.

I'm sorry, Maribel.

It's okay.

No, I mean it.

I hate you.
What?

I hate you?

Not I hate you.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Maribel.

You really are off your nut, you know that?

I had fun getting drunk

and singing show tunes
on top of your car.

Fag.

Call you tomorrow.

Okay. Good night.

You sure you're okay to drive?

Pretty sure.

You can always crash here.
My parents don't mind.

That might be a good idea.
Okay.

Come on.

Shit!

Oh, my God! I'm fuckin' drunk!

Yeah, you are.

You know, Joanne used to do this, too.

Oh, really?

Yeah, she had this way of pinning me
up against the car.

Something like this. Come here.

Kinda like that, with one leg.

I think she thought
she was being sexy.

Wow. That's hot.

Yeah, I always liked that.

She did it me one time after rehearsal.

Got old pretty fast.

Dude, I gotta go home.

Give me my keys, biatch.

You know, I'm glad you're straight-edged.

Why?

'Cause if you were drunk tonight,
I'd never hear the end of Joanne.

God! You scared the shit out of me.

Go to sleep. It's 3 in the morning.

So how was the party?

Go to sleep.

Hey...

did you get any pussy?

Dad, don't ask me that.

A father can't ask his own son
if he got any pussy?

You didn't take your meds today, did you?

Jesus Christ!

Just 'cause I ask you a simple question
about the party...

Never mind! Go to sleep!

<i>You have one new message</i>
<i>and 18 old messages.</i>

<i>Hello. This is Gary Nottingbird</i>
<i>calling from Theater Peninsula.</i>

<i>I'm calling for Billy Castillo.</i>

<i>I just reviewed my notes</i>
<i>from your audition the other day,</i>

<i>and I wanted to call and make sure</i>
<i>you're still interested in the part,</i>

<i>which we do want to offer you.</i>

<i>We just want to know</i>
<i>what your availability was.</i>

Rodel! Michael is here!

Rodel!
What?

Michael is here!

Hey, Ro.

You want eggs?
Fuck, yeah!

I never really liked him anyway.

I mean, I know I never
said anything, but...

Yeah, but I could tell.

Which is fine 'cause I hated Joanne.

Well, we're even, then.
Yeah.

I told him I was
perfectly fine being single.

I'd never been happier.

Never?

Nope.

Well, there was that one time
my family told me I was adopted.

Doesn't really count, though.

A month later, they told me
they were just kidding.

Jesus, that's fucked.

Yeah. Happy times.

Remember when I auditioned
for <i>Friend Joseph?</i>

Yeah.

I got a call yesterday.
Yeah.

I got the part of Jerry.

Holy crap!

My parents are still asleep.

You got cast in <i>Friend Joseph?</i>

Yeah.
As who?

You remember the play?
Yeah.

You remember Jerry?

The quirky Jewish
second-banana sidekick?

Yeah.
That's you?

That's me.
Oh, my God!

You're the quirky Jewish
second-banana sidekick.

I totally thought
they were gonna cast me

in the flamboyant gay role.

There's a difference?

I'm so happy for you.
Oh, my God!

Who did you get cast as, the gay guy?

No, I got cast as Jerry.

I though he was the gay guy.

No, he's the quirky Jewish sidekick.

Yee! I'm so excited for you!

Thank you.

It's just kind of depressing.

Why?

I don't know.

19 just sounds so much closer
to becoming a grownup.

And you're not a grownup?

No. I just want to look like a grownup
so I can get alcohol.

It's not just that. I kind of feel

like I've been clinging onto high school
since we graduated.

So that's why you've gotten
so much louder ever since.

Fuck you.

I'm just kidding. Go ahead.

I mean, high school...

Keep it down. I'm right here.

Can I talk now?

Yeah, go ahead.

High school, to me, was a place

where you didn't have
to make very many choices.

At least not
important ones anyway.

Now that we're out of high school,

I feel like that image I had of high school
was just an image.

Everybody thinks that
about high school.

Not Billy. And to an extent, not you.

You know,

I always thought Billy would
make it somewhere, though.

Somewhere real big.

Not you?

No, I used to dream about it, but...

As long as I have whatever I write, I'm happy.

You know, you really
should buy a journal.

It beats writing your ideas
down on scraps of paper.

Yeah. You know,
I lost one of those scraps of paper

in my room somewhere, by the way.

That's very Emily Dickinson
of you, by the way.

Um, hi.

I was wondering if you knew

where the rehearsals
for <i>Friend Joseph</i> were?

That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Oh, you're in the play, too, then.

Yeah. I'm Tara.

Tara. I remember you.

You were the one at the party
at Chester House.

Yeah? Which one?

Well, uh, you were in
a Polaroid on the fridge.

You were the one
flipping the camera off.

Hey, you're that sweaty guy
from the bathroom.

Great. That's how you remember me.

Well, yeah. I felt really bad.

I wanted to find out where you went,
but then I had to go.

You were gonna look for me?

Well, yeah.

I gave up on you, though.

Figured I lost you.

I'm not so sweaty now.

You're Filipino. You know
what would happen.

I don't know. My cousin came out to her dad,
and she's fine.

Jim's in prison.

Imagine the heartache
my dad would go through

if he found out his good son's a fag.

Okay, honestly,
I don't know how he could not know.

What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

I'm just saying.

You've never had a girlfriend,

and Michael's been sleeping over
for the past two years.

I just told him you're my girlfriend.

You fucker!
Hey, I had to.

I feel so used.

Admit it, you're flattered.

Well... yeah.

So, um, what's the surprise
you have for me and Billy?

Holy shit! Those I.D. S look real!

Don't they?

You go in first.

We both go in.

Couple of 40s, you know?

Get something cheap for us.

Ahem. I'm 21.

May I see your I. D?

7.50.

What the fuck, dude?
Do I look old?

Wow. I didn't realize
this is going to be such a big deal.

It is <i>Friend Joseph.</i>
There's really no other way to do it.

Well, l... I better
get to my car.

Okay.

Did you want to walk me to my car?

Yeah, sure.

Well, this is my car.

That wasn't far at all.

No.

We're holding hands.

Yeah. Now I'm kissing.

Tara, I kinda recently got
out of a bad relationship.

It's just a kiss.

Okay.

There's only one name on my mind

It's left my other thoughts behind

A name that's soft and kind

Tara

She won't be like the other girls

She won't make all my fears unfurl

Her name is such a pearl

Tara

It's happening

I feel it

I know she's the one for me

Tara

Tara

We are so mature for our age

Who's that?

What are you guys doing here?

Maribel's got a surprise for you.

What is it?

Remember that picture
you gave me three weeks ago?

Dude, we're in a fucking bar!

I know, and I'm having my first drink.

I made Maribel get me something light.

Okay by me.

God, I'm fucking happy having a drink!

A drink! Singular.

So, uh, who's that girl
you were kissing a while ago?

Her name is Tara.

She plays the ingenue in <i>Friend Joseph.</i>

Whoa. Dating from
within the cast?

Well, not necessarily. I told her

that I'd just got out of a relationship.

Why'd you say that?

'Cause I did.

Yeah, like, three months ago.

That's pretty recent.

Yeah, well, we didn't
see you stop kissing her.

Wait. We?

You and Maribel saw?

Yeah. Maribel was the one
who pointed you out to me.

Drink up, niggaz!

Dude, check out that guy over there.

I love him!

You mean Hulk Hogan?

That's fucked up!
Don't call him Hulk Hogan.

Dude, I'll call him what I want.

Damn. Maybe you should
slow down on that beer there.

I want another one.

Yes, you do.

What?
Is Ro home?

No, he's out.

Good.

Look at you,

coming in here with a bloke on each arm.

Well, what can I say?
I'm a lucky gal.

Shit! I'd say those two bastards
are the lucky ones.

Are you all swingers?

Yes.

No, we're just friends from high school.

Good. This isn't exactly
a couples bar, you know,

much less a triples bar.

This is a bar where some
of the people can commiserate.

Well, single is what we are.

The ancients say that Cupid

Shot his arrow through the air

Indiscriminately, just shooting

Arrows without a care

If I saw an infant with wings

Just randomly dealing death about

Well, I'd kick that flying baby's ass

And then I'd tear his wings out

Oh, good-bye, Cupid,
we bid farewell

To you

We've made up our minds

There's nothing you can do

No more tears, no more games

We're through with it all, ta-ta

No battle of sexes

We're through with out exes

So good-bye, stupid, <i>au revoir</i>

You know, this is
my first time drinking,

and I don't think
I've ever felt so free.

Atta boy! Here's the aspirin of love.

I one had a girl who made me feel all at once

At ease

And somehow simultaneously had me on

My knees

She met my cousin,
and then there wasn't

A time when she
had enough space

And I caught my cousin
wearing her crotch on his face

Cheating cunt!

Oh, good-bye, Cupid,
we bid farewell

To you

We've made up our minds

There's nothing you can do

No more tears, no more games

We're through with it all, ta-ta

Whatever we fear

We'll drown it in beer

So good-bye, stupid, <i>au revoir</i>

Champagne for my real friends,

and real pain for my sham friends.

That's a great quote.
Who said that?

I don't know. I probably did.

How can you not know
if you originated a phrase?

I lose track.

Besides, originality
is the art of hiding your sources.

Who said that?

Something I made up.

I once had a boy
who made me believe

I was the world

Saccharine sweet,
he said such things

That would make you hurl

I think he's gay.

He cheated once,
I was fine with that

But my personal things got attacked

And he stole money
out of my pockets,

pawned my dad's gun,

gaffled my secret stash of money,

and sold my entire
collection of DVDs...

For crack

Oh, good-bye, Cupid, we bid farewell

To you

We've made up our minds

There's nothing you can do

No more tears, no more games

We're through with it all, ta-ta

No sex where we stand

But we still got our hands

So good-bye, Cupid, <i>au revoir</i>

The exes are gone,
the breeder's upset

The faggot has had enough

Did you hear us, we've had enough

Everybody fucking sing!

Oh, good-bye, Cupid

We bid farewell

To you

We've made up our minds

There's nothing you can do

No more tears, no more games

We're through with it all, ta-ta

No battle of sexes.

We're through with our exes.

I can't believe that he took her.

I'll buy you a hooker.

So good-bye

Stupid, <i>au revoir</i>

How can I not see that car there?

You like it?

What, you mean it's mine?

Me and your mom bought it for you.

Go ahead. Get inside. Try it out.

I really wasn't expecting this.

You like it?

It's awesome!
Thank you so much.

No problem. You deserve it.

Rodel!

Ro, what the fuck happened?

Michael came to my house today
and told my dad everything.

What do you mean everything?

Everything!

How many people can tell you

That they know you so

Much more than you know?

And how many times
do you tell yourself

Nobody will

Or can feel your woes?

Every year I lose a part

Of my heart to the world

And narrowing down to the core

Of my quaint little world

The sides of the polygon change

And the number of points
in the shape rearrange

My circle of family

Friends and acquaintances

Is diminishing

Triangles stay the last shape

I know you think

Crazy is what

You only know

That's just not true

Crazy is what?

Tell me this day ended

The whole way with you

If you really think

That I would fare better

With somebody

Who claims to be some picture

Of sanity

Then I need you to be someone

Who can be

Crazy like me

Crazy like me

Crazy like me

Billy.

How are things going for you here?

Uh, fine.

Everything's fine. Why?

Well, l...

I'm just gonna spit it out.

You've been working here
for two weeks already,

and I'm thinking of having you
train for the register.

Wow. Okay.

Billy, this is more than okay.

This shows I have trust in you.

I don't just put any fucking mongoloid
on the register.

This is a big deal.

Well, that's stupendous, sir.

However...

and I'm gonna have
to level with you here...

I've noticed you've already
requested two days off

in the last two weeks.

Yeah, that's for my rehearsals.

See, we have a set schedule
for rehearsals.

But there isn't a set
schedule here, so l...

Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean

we don't have
a set schedule here?

You get the printed
schedule the week of.

Yeah, but l... I need more notice than that.

I mean, it's hardly a set schedule.

It changes every week.

All right, how many more
days off in the future

do you think you're
gonna be requesting?

I don't know. I mean,

I guess whenever
my schedule here

clashes with my rehearsals.

That was the wrong answer.

So what are you saying
I should do?

Well, I think you should either

make arrangements with
your theater people,

or... and I'm not trying to sway
your decision or anything here...

but you should go with us.

Any mongoloid would know
it's the right choice.

Since you stay with your parents,

is there really any reason
for you to have this job?

Yes, I need this job.

I would go crazy
if I didn't have this job.

Well, maybe you can get
a different job

that allows you to...
Babe, I need the job.

I need the money.

I'm saving up for something big.

Saving for what?

Something big, okay?

You know, it's the best paying shit job

I can get right now.

Sorry if I'm being nosy.
You're not being nosy.

Joanne, she was nosy.

Hey, what's up with that party
we're going to tonight?

Yeah, it's a networking party.

There's gonna be writers and actors
and directors and even some bands.

Nice. That sounds cool.

Yeah, we're thinking about

bringing my cards
with me... you know,

pitch myself to these directors.

Wow. I should do that, too,

'cause they're always
looking for more actors.

Actually, I was thinking about
bringing some of my plays, too.

People want writers
just as much.

Yeah, but they're a dime a dozen.

You know, I really like
what you've done

with your character, by the way.

You've really made it your own.

Thanks. You know,
I'm pretty proud of it.

You know, it's
a new <i>Friend Joseph,</i>

so I figured, why not
create a new Jerry?

I wanna be known
for this version of Jerry.

How's Rodel doing?

He's all right.

I don't think that
he likes me very much.

Why would you say that?
Just a feeling.

Like whenever he's around,

there's this really subtle vibe that,

you know, if you're
not sharp, you'll miss it.

I thought I'd find you here
with orange chicken.

Dude, I like orange chicken.

Yeah, I know. But that's not orange chicken.

That's deep-fried, Westernized
Chinese versions of chicken nuggets

in orange sauce.

Dude, orange colored sauce.
I know, right?

Hi, Rodel.

Hey, how'd the flyering go?

Uh, like, five
neighborhoods, I think.

Yeah, I did five neighborhoods.

Damn. Nice.

We should have a good audience
for opening night, at least.

By the way, I am doing your laundry
from now on.

Um, weird. Okay.

Why?

I need the practice.
See, I need to look

at tags and labels
so I could tell customers

how to wash their own clothes.

So you want to experiment
with my clothes.

He just wants more clothes
to wash than he already has.

Hi. Guess who I was talking to.

Oh, I gotta go.

See you.
See you at home, man.

I'll see you at home.
Bye.

So...
Hello?

Hey, Maribel.

No, sorry, my phone's on vibrate.

Uh, no, I'm at the cafe right now.

I was just talking to Billy.

No, nothing much, really.

Just, uh, you know, eating.

Bye, Ro.

Oh. "Bye, Ro."

Yeah, suddenly she knows me so well.

Yeah, she can call me Ro.

I mean, she leaves her food here
for other people to clean up.

So fucking self-centered.

Are you talking about me?

Oh, now she thinks
I'm talking about her.

Yeah, whatever.

Now she's walking away like a freshly-fucked
fucking prostit...

Hello?

Do you know what today is?

Thursday.

Did you want to be alone today?

Yeah.

Good.

I came just in time.

Deadwalking quietly

Through the graves

The grass of the graveyard

Beneath my feet

Everyone sleeping

I feel the hush

My heart steady pulsing

The only beat

These are the main
Colma residents

For this is
the true population now

Graveyards and tombstones

To dot the hills

There's more of them dead

Than alive in town

Come dance with me

Till the sun

Goes down

That's where my mom's buried.

I know, right? What do you say to that?

I know.

I feel like I could say, "Oh, wow,"
or, "Oh, really?"

But it'll sound fake.

Why fake? 'Cause you're not really interested?

No.

It's not 'cause I'm not interested.

It's just kinda heavy.

Yeah, it's always easier

to walk around the heavy stuff.

Do you want to visit your mom?

Now you're just trying
to prove something to me.

No, I just figured
that since we're here...

Nah.

Are you sure?
Because we can go...

Let it go.

This is my future main residence

Just deadwalking
nowhere and everywhere

No one and everyone
knows your name

And nothing and everything
in the end

We will be resting beneath the soil

And flying so high
up above the clouds

Nothing too heinous to worry us

And nothing bad, either

To cry about

Come dance with me

Till the sun

Goes down

You know, I always figured we'd all move in
together at some point.

Yeah, I always thought it might be
kind of cool if we all did.

Well, you're living with Billy now.

How's that?

I'm so grateful.

I really am.

I just think it might be cooler

if we all moved in together, you know?

I know.

Still living in his parents' house.

Yeah, that feels awkward.

You know, just having piles of my clothes
lying around his room.

Just clothes?

I never got the rest
of my shit from my dad.

Are you going to?

I don't know.

I don't want to talk
about that right now.

Okay. Let's drop it.

Let it go.

Deadwalking quietly

Through the graves
This is my future

Main residence
The grass of the graveyard

Beneath my feet
Just deadwalking nowhere

And everywhere
Everyone sleeping

I feel the hush
No one and everyone

Knows your name
My heart steady pulsing

The only beat
Nothing and everything

In the end
These are the main Colma residents

We will be resting beneath the soil
For this is the true

Population now
And flying so high up

Above the ground
Graveyards and tombstones

To dot hills
Nothing too heinous

To worry us
There's more of them dead than alive in town

Nothing bad, either, to cry about

Come dance with me

Come dance with me

Come dance with me

Come dance with me

Come dance with me

Till the sun

Goes down

By the way, Maribel?

What?

Happy Birthday.

Hey.
Hey.

Oh, l... I washed
all of your clothes.

Wow, thanks.

No, um...

You know your black shirt?

Yeah.

You took my black shirt
and made it look like

some kind of fucked up sock puppet.

Hey, you want to come with us

to that networking party tonight?

A who?
It's a networking party.

There's gonna be, like, actors and directors,
and writers there.

It's actually called
a networking party?

How shameless is that?

Most people try to disguise it by calling it

a tsunami benefit or something.

Yeah, it's pretty
to-the-point, I guess.

Dude, we're taking Maribel out for her birthday.

Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget.

I just sort of planned
everything really poorly.

You forgot.
Yeah, I forgot.

Dude, it's okay.

There'll be more networking parties.

What makes you think
I'm not going?

I don't know, Billy. Maybe because Maribel's
one of your best friends.

Oh, come on. Don't give me that.

Do you think I can afford
not to be seen at this party?

You can't afford not to be seen at this party?

No, I can't!

Well, if he can't, he can't, you know?

Yeah, I mean, he says he's sorry.

Okay.

You don't sound okay.

He could have called me himself.

He never flakes.

Well, I mean,

it was an emergency
rehearsal, you know?

I mean, he had to get on the road
as soon as he got the message.

Plus his cell phone's dead.

I had to come and relay
the message for him.

Interesting.

Wow. Didn't expect
to see you here.

Yeah, that party was pretty lame.

It was less like
schmooze and booze,

and it was more like
booze and snooze.

Tara made some contacts,

and some director wanted
to put me in his Latin play.

It was pretty lame.

Probably should have
gone with you guys.

Probably would have been more fun.

How's Maribel?

Did you hear me? How's Maribel?

I told her you had
an emergency rehearsal

and that your cell phone is dead.
Nice.

She still seemed really sad
that you weren't there.

Jesus Christ,
you gave her that story,

and she still laid a guilt trip on you?

How self-centered can you get?

We got, like, four weeks until we open.

Yeah, well, you should call her anyway.

She's visiting L.A. For a week.

Yeah, I probably should.

Hello.

Hi, baby.

Yeah?

Good.

I had a wonderful time.

Yeah.

"Tara and Billy, the perfect match.

"I've got a match:
His face and her ass."

"Both have their sights
on the stars and the sky.

It's their excuse to have their noses so high."

Why'd you write this?

Where'd you get that?

From your pocket.
You go through my fucking pockets?

Are you gonna be the type of dad
who reads his kids' diaries?

How dare you you!
How dare you write this shit!

What, do you think it's not true?

I'm going to bed, Billy.

I need to wake up early
so I can pass out your flyers.

So, uh, this isn't as big
as I thought it was gonna be.

It's not big.

I mean, it's pretty big
for a regional theater, but...

God, the way Billy's
been talking about this,

I kinda expected something...

bigger.
Word.

Hey, it's Billy!

Oh, he's looking for us.

Hi, honey.
Hey.

Everybody, this is Maribel,

and this is my bestest
friend in the world, Rodel.

This is Gary, the director.

You guys know Tara.
Hi.

And this is John. He helped flyer.

In all kinds of crazy neighborhoods.

Rodel helped flyer, too.
Cool.

Sorry, I'm gonna have
to cut this short.

I have to tend to
the rest of the actors.

It was really nice meeting you.

I'm gonna go help Gary.
Okay.

Enjoy the show.

Hey, thanks.

Dude, don't be catty.

What?

Oh, and before I forget.

Cool. Thanks, man.

Hey, it's the least I could do
after all those flyers you passed out.

Now get back in there and change.

Oh...

You should go soon?

I should go now.

Did he just pay that guy in front of you?

Yeah.

Did you count a hundred dollars?
I did.

And how much did Billy
pay you for flyering?

Well...

jack shit.

Oh, man.

Oh, man.

What?
Don't look now,

but when you can,

look who's in line to see the show.

Oh, man.

Opening number

A musical show

There isn't anyone in here

That you'll really know

Regional theater

Wouldn't you know?

We're starring in a musical show

Playbills say that this show is a rage

Clever and witty

And only off stage

Let's stop with the fodder

Continue the show

It's time for us to meet Friend Joseph

I love you
I know 'cause you're telling me in song

I love you

Even though we haven't
known each other long

I love you
It's been, what, 15 minutes, if that

Oh, I love you
What the hell, I love you, too

Hope neither one of us

Dies

I am not the lead

And I am standing here to say

Despite the way I come across

I really am not gay

I'm just quirky, quirky, quirky

I'm so whimsical and quirky

I'm supporting-actor quirky

I'm so quirk, and I'm not gay

I am quirky, quirky, quirky

So damn quirky, quirky, quirky

I'm the best-friend kind of quirky

And again, I am not gay

Hey, Joseph!
What?

Did you hear the one
about the musical theater actor

who tried to tell a funny joke on stage?

No.

Thank you very much.

I am quirky, quirky, quirky

So damn quirky, quirky, quirky

I'm supporting-actor quirky

I'm so quir-ky

I am quirky, quirky, quirky

So damn quirky, quirky, quirky

Oh, Jerry. I shall always have
a special place in my heart for you.

But you won't have me.

Oh, Jerry. My heart belongs to someone else.

Oh, Joanne.

Don't. I swear to God.

I'm sorry, okay? It slipped out.

I saw her in the audience,
and it just slipped out.

Billy, I used to hope
that I could go one day

without you mentioning
her fucking name.

Do you know that?

I told you I got out
of a bad relationship.

I never said I wanted anything.

No, you never said a thing.

Tara never really
believed in the Grail.

How can you fuckin'
joke about this?

'Cause it <i>is</i> a fuckin' joke.

Whatever, dude. We'll talk later.

No, we probably won't.

Why?

Why?

Why?

Why, Rodellio?

I hate you!

I hate you!

Hey.
Hey.

If you want to put
those in my car...

It's okay.

You're not that far away.

I'll just walk to your house.

Wait.

Let him, Billy, please.

Is he okay?

He'll be fine.

He'll be okay.

What'd you buy?

Wine?
Yep.

Guillermo Maria Castillo,
you bought wine?

Well, I had to use that fake I.D.
You gave me, right?

Now I'm in dire need.
This needs to be open now.

Yay for metal twist caps.

I could never be a wine taster.

I guess you can't,
'cause this sure as hell don't taste like wine.

Am I that horrible a person?

Well, you've always been
a smug little prick.

You think I'm kidding?

No, I'm laughing
'cause I know you're not.

It's cute when you swear.

You gonna pass that over,
Swiggy Marley?

Sorry.

There's only one
name on my mind

It's left my other thoughts behind

A name that's soft and kind

Maribel

Tara

Joanne

She won't be like the other girls

She won't be like the other girls

She won't make
all my fears unfurl

She won't make
all my dreams unfurl

Her name is such a pearl

Maribel

Tara

Joanne
It's happening

I feel it
Joanne

I know she's the one for me

Maribel

Maribel

We are so mature for our age

I don't know what you thought that was.

It was a kiss.

Sweetie...

What?

Want to hear something I wrote?

A diatribe?

A what?

Nothing.

Go ahead.

"Colma stays.

"Land of cemeteries,

"car dealerships, and schools.

"Nary a thing I haven't done in Colma.

"Maybe I'll come back
again some day.

"I leave the lines far behind.

"Find my future
sparkling and shiny.

"Maybe there's a reason why

"the world goes on and on.

That's really nice.
"Good-bye land of sand and fog.

"Good-bye, Daly City smog.

"And good-bye to the house
I lived in since I was a kid.

"Maybe I know just
what you meant to me.

"That's nothing and everything
all at once."

You looked really happy

when you came back
from L.A., by the way.

I got laid.
It's not just that.

You had a glow about you.

You ever think about moving to L. A?

L. A?

That's just as bad
as moving to New York.

Whatever, man.
You'd be out of Colma.

Nah.

Can't.

Why not?

Billy says you're
too rainbows and unicorns for L.A.

What the fuck does he know?
Right?

You know, the night of your birthday,

he didn't really have rehearsal.

You know, I kinda figured.

I made that up.

You made that up?

Yeah, he actually didn't want to go.

He tried to drag me to some stupid
networking party with Tara.

I told him, "It's Maribel's birthday"...

So you knew that night,

but you didn't tell me the truth.

It was your birthday.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

But you'll hurt my feelings now?

I figured you should know.

Why tell me now?

Why tell me at all?

'Cause you don't like Billy anymore,

you figure it's okay
to hurt my feelings?

Would you rather I didn't tell you at all?

I don't know.

It's cool.

Never mind.

Listen, things got out of hand.

Things were said.

Basically, everybody's at fault here.

Yeah.

Everybody.

So you're mad at me.

No.

I'm fine.

I don't believe that.

Well, if I am,

maybe I'll tell you next week.

You know those rare days
when there's no fog

and you can see clear
out past the city limits

and you can't help but notice
the San Francisco skyline

and you realize
how close we actually are

to a major metropolis?

And I wonder, you know,
when the fog clears,

do people in San Francisco
notice us?

I mean, why would they, right?

The most they would see
from over the hills and fog

would be this flat land

with a bunch of houses all lined up

in sort of a wavy grid.

Or maybe it could be
something somber and tragic,

when all they see
are a bunch of graveyards.

They can't see the little things that make us

so much different from the city.

I mean, kids play
in huge groups in the street.

People have driveways.

Neighbors have barbecues
in their backyards.

People fuckin' have backyards.

Yeah, and then
there's the fog.

When it's thicker
than your average mist,

and you can see it
rolling in on the city

like a huge lumpy blanket.

When I was small,
I would stand on this hill

and watch as the sunny sky
turned to fog

as it rolled over and through me.

And I would pretend
that I was being carried

on the grassy hump
of a flying city,

slowly breaking through the clouds
as we soar off into the horizon,

and my city in the clouds
taking me somewhere better.

Yeah.

Then the fog clears,

and the grass around my feet
is moist with dew,

and...

the sun burns off
whatever mist is left,

and, you know,

I can see the skyline
of San Francisco

way off in the distance...

and I'm happy.

One day I'll find my happy place

And I ain't gonna
share nothin' with you

'Cause you've got your own

You have your own

One day I'll find my happy place

And I'm determined
that I'm never gonna find

My way back out

My way back out

I know we'll lie somewhere

Beyond the clouds

And open air

My heart is stopping

I don't care

I know that I'll be

There

One day I'll find my happy place

And maybe then I'll find a person

Who can curl up in my arms

In my arms

I know we'll lie somewhere

Beyond the clouds

And open air

My heart is stopping

I don't care

I know that I'll be

There

One step at a time

I climb

To the highest point

I know that if I try

I'll fly

So high you won't believe

What I can do

It's true

My happy place is waiting

In the sky

And I

Can meet you there

Hey.
Hey.

I'm leaving.

I know.

Where are you going?

New York.

Wow.

Yeah, I'm taking the bus.

What are you gonna do there?

Don't know.

Why New York?

L... I don't know. I don't really have

any good reasons
for anything I do.

That's very Rodel of you.

L... I don't see how,
but okay.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

When did the whole
New York thing come up?

Remember when I moved
into Maribel's?

I took my bags over to her house?

I think that night

was the first time I realized

that I am unhappy.

I told Maribel the reason
you didn't come to dinner that night.

Oh.

Yeah.

And the poem that I wrote?

I wrote that intentionally for you to read,

and I had it folded up

and sticking out of my pocket
on top of the laundry

'cause I knew you'd find it there.

Why would you do that?

I don't know, Billy.
Maybe because I'm unhappy?

I don't have any reasons
for anything I do.

I'm leaving.

Yeah, I see that.
You look packed.

Yeah.

Finally moving.

Where to?

San Francisco.

Oh, the city.

A whole five minutes away.

Don't mock me.

No, I'm not mocking you.

I just...

It's convenient, you know?

You can see your mom and dad
whenever you want.

I should get going.

E-mail me when things get better.

I never said I needed
to be loved by you

I never said I needed to be loved

I guess I came across
as needy anyway

At least needy enough

So maybe all of them
just didn't need to hear

Maybe they just knew

Maybe they felt

That I needed

The space to be filled

That was once filled by you

But maybe, maybe this time

I realize

Something new

Maybe I'm finding out

For myself

Without being told

Maybe I know

Just what you meant

To me

That's nothing

And everything

All at once

To my friends

I thank you all

You make me who I am

What I think

What I choose

Because of you, I can

You're the ones

Who fill the space

You're the ones that I need

You are the ones

That I look for in times

Of my darkest need

But maybe

Maybe this time I can leave all

All on my own

Maybe I have the reason

To finally step forth

And fearfully grow

What is it I'm hanging on to

Here in Colma?

I think I know

That's nothing

And everything

All at once

I can take whatever fits inside my car

I can start anew

I let go of all the things that hurt me so

I let go of you

I have bigger, brighter
things ahead of me

I see brighter days

Everything fits in my car

I'm taking it all

But Colma

Stays

Colma stays

Land of cemeteries

Car dealerships and schools

There's nary a thing
I haven't done in Colma

Maybe I'll come back again one day

I leave the tracks far behind me

Find my future
sparkling and shiny

Maybe there's a reason why

The world goes on and on

While Colma stays

And Colma stays

Good-bye land of sand and fog

Good-bye, Daly City smog

Good-bye to the house I lived in

Since I was a kid

And Colma stays

Yes, Colma stays

Colma stays

But I have to go

I know you don't know how to feel

Believe me, I am in the dark

Everyone involved is asking

What do we make of all of this?

Why does the future look so stark?

Everyone involved is asking

Who are you?

What happened?

It all looks so damned crystal clear

Where are we?

Why ask it?

All you should know
is that we're here

All of the questions that you ask

I'm sure that I can't answer

I can't answer anything

You ask me here

And as the credits roll

I walk alone

Teetering on the edge of

I don't belong

Constantly on the verge of

I won't have any answers

I can't answer anything

You ask me here

And as the credits roll

And when we hit the daylight

I will be, he will be

You will be

One step at a time.

I can't answer anything

You ask me here

And as the credits roll

I walk alone

Teetering on the edge of

I don't belong

Constantly on the verge of

Spinning unfinished questions

I won't answer anything

You ask me here

And as the credits roll

I walk alone

As the credits roll

I don't belong

As the credits roll

I see the starting point

Every moment has a moment
following the last

You were so experienced
in what follows the past

Don't pretend to know the answer

And I'll do the same

Don't be glib

And I will promise
not to play the game

The time is now

As the credits roll
The time is now

As the credits roll
The time is now

As the credits roll
The time is now

As the credits roll
The time is now

The time is now

The time is now

The time is now

The time is now
We have to do that again.

That's so fun!
